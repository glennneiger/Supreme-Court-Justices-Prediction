mr.
louis
w.
karlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
present
co-tenant's
consent
to
search
is
not
nullified,
must
not
be
nullified
or
rendered
invalid
by
an
absent
tenant's
prior
objection.
everyone
knows
that
when
they
choose
to
live
together
and
one
person
is
absent
the
other
person
has
the
authority.
that
person
has
the
authority
to
admit
visitors
of
her
choice,
to
--
and
certainly
to
consent
to
a
search
of
a
shared
premises.
here
ms.
rojas
had
the
authority,
as
the
sole
present
tenant,
to
call
the
shots,
to
admit
visitors
of
her
choice,
and
to
consent
to
a
search.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
when
a
person
leaves
a
residence,
and
this
was
the
linchpin
of
randolph,
when
a
person
leaves
the
residence,
social
expectations
change,
they
change
dramatically.
you're
not
faced
with
the
situation
of
pushing
past
someone
who
is
saying
〝
stay
out
″.
when
someone
leaves,
i
will
think
differently
about
my
permission
to
come
in,
regardless
of--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--justice
sotomayor,
randolph
remains
efficacious
for
the
narrow
situation
it
was
crafted
to
object
--
to
address.
a
person
says:
stay
out,
you
may
not
search;
the
police
may
not
search.
and
that
remains
in
effect
under
the
formalistic
rule
of
randolph
while
that
person
remains
in
the
premises.
now--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--well,
the
police
can't
just
remove
a
person--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--well,
certainly,
as
in
this
case
where
there's
a
valid
arrest,
that
person
is
gone.
that
person
is
absent
by
any
standard,
and
that's
an
objectively
reasonable
thing
the
police
officers
did.
can
they
just
remove
him?
it
would
be
a
different
case
probably
if
they
just
removed
him
without
probable
cause.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
well,
the
reason
the
hour
and
a
half
rule
i
think
would
be
wrong
is
that
it
would
effectively
rob
the
co-tenant
of
her
authority
over
the
--
over
that
space.
when
he's
gone,
she
really
is
in
charge,
and
that
is
the
social
expectation.
that's
matlock.
that's
the
underlying
assumption
in
matlock,
that
when
we're
gone,
we
assume
the
risk--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--i
think
there
are
two
things
here.
one,
your
concurrence
was
very
narrow,
and
it
said
when
he
was
physically
present,
and
if
circumstances
change,
the
results
should
change.
the
second
reason
is
that
this
court
in
kentucky
v.
king
gave
a
very
good
response
to
this
scenario
and
said
if
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
the
run-up
to
--
there
it
was
the
exigent
circumstances
search
--
so
here
in
the
run-up
to
the
consent,
the
analysis
is
different.
here
of
course
we
have
a
legitimate
arrest.
the
person
is
absent
by
any
standard.
social
expectations
in
this
case
would
say
someone
wanted
to
give
assistance
to
ms.
rojas.
social
expectations
would
say:
i've
just
seen
the
objector,
having
abused
her,
being
hauled
away
to
jail.
social
--
and
now
i
want
to
help
her.
social
expectations
would
say
he
should
help.
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
a
stranger,
or
a
friend,
or
the
repairman
to
come
in
and
look
at
the
wall
heating
unit
where
the
sawed-off
shotgun
was.
randolph
didn't
draw
that
--
that
distinction.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
the
social
expectation
analysis
in
randolph
really
wasn't
intended
to
address
that
question.
the
social
expectation
was
that
--
sort
of
a
tie-breaker.
we
know
that
under
general
law,
co-tenant
consent
controls.
it's
valid
per
se.
but
what
do
we
do
when
someone
is
saying
〝
stay
out
″?
so
the
reason
for
using
the
social
expectation
question
was
to
say
what
would
a
caller
do,
what
would
a
visitor
do,
confronted
with
that.
and
the
question
it
was
answering
was:
would
the
person
feel
okay
to
enter?
it
didn't
answer
the
second
question
of
what
happens
after.
what
happens
after
had
already
been
answered
by
this
court
in
matlock
when
it
said
the
whole
basis
for
the
co-tenant
consent
is
that
it's
shared
authority.
so
once
you're
in--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--correct.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
what
--
what
controls
in
matlock
is
the
underlying
reasoning
that
it's
no
longer
a
question
of
agency,
and
that
really
is
the
theory
of
petitioner.
matlock
rejected
the
notion
of
agency.
what
it
said
was
in
determining
co-tenant
consent,
each
co-tenant
exercises
his
or
her
own
rights
on
her
own
or
his
own.
so
when
one
is
gone,
it
is
that
person's
own
right.
it's
not
a
question
of
what
would
this
person
do
on
behalf
of
the
absent
tenant.
it
is
what
this
person
would
do
on
his
or
her
own
behalf.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
but,
your
honor,
in
--
in
this
case
when
the
objection
was
made,
the
police
weren't
searching.
when
the
police
went
to
search,
there
was
only
one
occupant
there.
mr.
fernandez
was
long
gone.
and
the
whole
premise
of
randolph
is
that
you
have
a
present
person
saying
come
in
and
you
have
a
present
person
staying
out.
yes,
the
--
the
lead
opinion
in
randolph
said
they
cancel
each
other
out.
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
when
there
is
only
one
person
at
the
door,
there
is
no
randolph
dilemma.
there's
no
dilemma.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
right.
but
the
police
action
at
every
step
in
this
case
was
not
merely
reasonable,
but
really
exemplary.
and
when
that
statement
was
made,
stay
out,
it
was
completely
unenforceable.
so
the
question
is
whether
that
prior
statement
somehow
continues
forward
to
bar,
essentially
to
hold
ms.
rojas
hostage
to
this
prior
objection.
he's
no
longer
there.
he
never
had
any
legitimate
expectation
that
in
his
absence
he
could
enforce
this
edict.
so
i
think
that
the
--
the
presence-absence
dichotomy
is
really
critical.
and
--
oh,
the
concern
was
raised
that,
well,
we're
saying
you've
got
to
camp
out
on
the
lawn
in
order
to
enforce
this.
we're
not
saying
that.
a
randolph
objection
is
valid
when
it's
made
and
it's
valid
and
it
continues
to
remain
valid
while
you're
in
the
premises.
now,
is
there
nothing
you
can
do?
there
are
things
you
can
do.
you
can
create,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
a
nonshared
space.
so,
you
can
have
a
locked
box.
you
can
have
a
closet
to
which
only
you
have
access.
you
can
have
a
locked
office
to
which
only
you
have
access.
so
there
are
things
you
can
do.
of
course,
you
could
also
choose
to
live
alone.
you
could
choose
to
live
with
someone
who
would
enforce
your
rights.
these
are
all
things
that
are
open
to
a
--
to
a
cotenant.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
i
do
not
dispute
that.
i
think
that's
chimel
or
chimel
and
that
established
that.
the
question
is
not
his
expectation
of
privacy.
the
question
is
whether
his
--
in
his
absence,
this
prior
statement
can
trump
the
authorized
tenant
who's
in
charge.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
your
honor,
in
--
in
rodriguez
and
in
--
the
question
is
apparent
authority
to
give
consent
to
shared
spaces.
so
you
--
the
police
can
only
enter
and
search
spaces
that
are
shared.
they
cannot
go
into
spaces
where
the
cotenant
does
not
have
apparent
authority
to
grant
release.
so
if
that's
a
place
she
doesn't
have
access
to,
no.
you
know,
this
is
mine,
stay
out.
here's,
you
know,
a
lock,
a
padlock
on
it.
it
would
be
probably
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
say,
you
know,
we
think
you
have
authority
to
grant
us
consent
to
look
in
that
box.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
yes.
but
again--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--if
it's
--
if
it's
a
locked
--
we
can
have
a
variety
of
--
of
living
arrangements
and
there
can
certainly
be
within
a
home
a
space
that
is
truly
yours.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
but
i
do
think
that
--
that
you
can
create
spaces
that,
from
all
reasonable
appearances,
are
--
are
yours.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
well,
in
this
case,
that's
exactly
what
they
did--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--and
no
one
is
contesting
that.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
yes.
so
we
really
have
the--
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
--no.
the
--
the
police
said
we've
arrested
petitioner
and
now
we
want
to
conduct
a
search
for
evidence,
so.
but
looking
at
this
pragmatically,
realistically,
why
wouldn't
she
want
to
hand
over
the
shotgun
directly,
assuming
she
could
get
it
out,
assuming
she
wanted
to
handle
it?
well,
she's
living
at
the
epicenter
of
gang
territory
with
an
abusive
boyfriend.
she
--
certainly,
the
power's
there
under
coolidge,
that
authority
is
there,
but
realistically,
wouldn't
she
want
to
say
--
to
avoid
directly
handing
over
the
--
the
--
instruments
of
criminality?
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
reasonable
thing
to
do
to
say
it's
okay
to
search,
but
i
don't
want
to
be
handing
you
directly
the
evidence.
mr.
louis
w.
karlin
well,
with
regard
to
the
voluntariness,
that
was
established
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
is
not
being
challenged.
this
search
was
voluntary
and
has
been
held
that.
now,
at
the
suppression
hearing
when
officer
cirrito
testified
on
rebuttal,
he
said,
no,
we
never
threatened
that.
and
his
testimony
really
makes
a
lot
of
sense
because
they
never
began
the
domestic
abuse
investigation
until
after
they
had
come
back
upstairs
and
gotten
consent.
and
what
he
said
was
once
they
found
the
sawed-off
shotgun,
they
had
to
alert
child
services.
so
the
court
found
that
ms.
rojas's
consent
was
not
coerced,
and
it
implicitly
rejected
those
allegations.
to
conclude,
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
ms.
rojas
is
a
sole
present
tenant,
was
entitled
to
give
the
police
consent
to
search
the
shared
residence.
her
authority
to
decide
what's
best
for
herself
and
her
family
should
not
be
held
hostage
to
an
absent
tenant's
objection.
