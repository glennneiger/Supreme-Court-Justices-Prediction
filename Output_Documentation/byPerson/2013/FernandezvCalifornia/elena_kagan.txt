justice
elena
kagan
mr.
karlin,
don't
you
find
that
a
little
bit
odd?
i
mean,
this
social
expectations
analysis
applied
to
a
case
in
which
a
police
officer
has
power
that
no
person,
no
stranger
has.
the
police
officer
has
just
put
the
man
in
handcuffs
and
taken
him
away.
a
stranger
does
not
have
that
power.
so
it's
a
bit
odd
to
say:
well,
social
expectations
say
that
the
stranger
can
walk
into
the
house,
you
know,
having
just
carted
the
person
away.
you
can't
do
that.
justice
elena
kagan
you
see,
i
thought
that
randolph
rejected
that
analysis.
i
thought
that
randolph
said
--
and
you
could
agree
with
it
or
disagree
with
it
--
but
it
said,
and
i'm
quoting
here,
"the
cooperative
occupant's
invitation
adds
nothing
to
the
government's
side
to
counter
the
force
of
an
objecting
individual's
claim
to
security
against
the
government's
intrusion
into
his
dwelling
place.
"
so,
when
you
have
an
objection,
randolph
says,
the
objection
trumps.
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
cooperative
occupant
there,
well,
again,
i'm
just
quoting,
〝
it
adds
nothing
″.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
this
goes
back
to
my
--
my
other
question.
i
find
it
impossible
to
get
my
head
around
this
case
without
recognizing
that
we
don't
have
it
here,
because
the
police
have
taken
the
objector
away.
and
so
the
police
themselves
have,
you
know,
properly
exercised
a
power
that
is
the
reason
we
don't
continue
to
have
the
situation
that
randolph
concerned.
justice
elena
kagan
you
don't
disagree,
do
you,
mr.
karlin
--
and
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth
--
but
you
don't
disagree
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
does
not
decline
after
the
arrest
is
made.
in
other
words,
that
mr.
fernandez's
expectation
of
privacy
remains
the
same.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
karlin,
there
is
in
this
case
some
indication
that
she
was
not
inviting
this
search,
that
she
in
the
end
consented,
but
only
after
the
police
suggested
that
her
child
could
be
taken
away
and,
you
know,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
i'm
standing
at
the
door
dying
for
you
to
come
in.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore,
could
i
ask
what
you
think
that
this
sentence
means
in
randolph?
there's
a
--
there's
a
statement
that
says:
"so
long
as
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
police
have
removed
the
potentially
objecting
tenant
from
the
entrance
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
the
possible
objection.
"
what
do
you
think
that
means?
when
do
you
think
it
would
apply?
justice
elena
kagan
so
it
would
only
apply
if
the
--
if
the
taking
the
person
away
from
the
home
was
unreasonable.
but
as
long
as
that
was
lawful,
whether
you
did
it
by
saying,
you
know,
come
walk
around
the
block
with
me
or
whether
you
actually
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
you
took
him
to
the
stationhouse,
either
way,
that
this
language
would
not
apply.
justice
elena
kagan
and
has
anybody
ever
found
that
conduct
fit
within
that
language?
has
any
court
ever
used
that
language
in
any
way
to
state
that
this,
you
know,
this
goes
beyond
the
bounds?
