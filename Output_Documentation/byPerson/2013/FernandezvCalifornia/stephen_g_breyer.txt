g.

that's
the
reason
--
maybe
i
should
put
to
you
at
the
outset
the
problem
with
the
case
that's
bothering
me.
neighbors
hear
a
noise.
police
come
to
the
door.
man
and
wife
are
there.
she,
as
in
this
case,
has
a
bump
on
her
nose,
holding
a
baby
and
is
crying
and
blood
on
her
shirt.
the
police,
for
whatever
set
of
reasons,
arrest
the
husband.
the
woman
says,
mr.
policeman,
i
would
like
you
to
come
in
the
house.
i'd
like
you
to
look
at
a
couple
of
the
closets.
i'm
worried
about
what's
in
them.
i
can't
quite
tell
you
what
it
is.
i
don't
know.
but
i'd
like
you
to
look
through
the
house.
now,
is
that
woman
never
to
be
able
to
get
a
policeman
in
the
house?
never?
i
mean,
months
go
by.
she
owns
the
house,
too.
and
by
the
way,
i've
tried
to
keep
out
of
my
hypothetical
any
other
basis
for
getting
in.
it's
not
a
--
she's
not
a
danger.
the
husband's
gone.
she
is
--
no
destruction
of
evidence.
she
won't
destroy
it.
you
see
--
and
so
that
--
she
owns
the
house.
can
she
never
invite
the
policeman
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
what
basis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
what
basis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
she
says,
i
don't
know
what's
in
the
closet,
mr.
policeman.
i
don't
know
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
my
bloody
nose.
i
just
would
like
you
to
take
a
look
around.
now,
see,
i
tried
to
keep
out
probable
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
tried
to
eliminate
any
other
basis.
and
that's
what
is
worrying
me
on
the
--
worry
stemming
from,
but
it's
her
house,
too.
can't
she
invite
people
into
her
house,
too,
whom
she
wants,
including
the
policeman?
now,
that's
the
example
that
got
me
to
write
separately
in
the
other
case.
that's
the
example
that
keeps
gnawing
on
my
mind,
and
i
--
and
i'd
like
you
to
address
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
she
invite
them
in?
the
husband
has
said,
never,
i
don't
want
a
policeman
to
step
foot
in
my
house,
and
it's
not
just
the
closet.
she
wants
the
police
to
take
a
good
look
around.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
circular
question,
you
see,
because
once
you
say
right,
you
assume
the
answer.
i
mean,
if
the
wife
has
--
to
the
extent
she
has
the
ability
to
ask
anyone
into
the
house,
even
over
the
husband's
objection,
then
the
conclusion
is
he
doesn't
have
a
privacy
right
or
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
vis-a-vis
what
his
wife
wants.
and
if
you
decide
it
the
other
way,
he
does.
and
the
hard
problem,
i
mean
the
hard
problem
for
me,
is
--
but
i'll
ask
the
other
side
that
--
under
what
circumstances,
when,
how
do
we
work
out?
and
the
answer
in
randolph
was
social
expectation.
and,
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
the
social
expectation
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
that's
the
initial
problem
i
started
with
in
this
case.
the
policeman
is
standing
at
the
door.
she
owns
the
house.
she
says,
come
in.
come
in.
maybe
it's
i'd
just
like
to
talk
to
you.
maybe
it's
i'd
like
to
show
you
a
few
things.
the
four-year-old
says
the
spouse
hit
her.
that's
why
she's
bleeding.
she
later
says,
oh,
no,
it
wasn't
the
spouse.
it
was
a
woman
named
veronica.
maybe
that's
all
true
here.
but
you
could
surely
imagine
cases
where
you
had
a
little
window
of
opportunity
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
that
house,
which
is
hers.
and
now
you
say
no,
as
long
as
the
husband
who
may
have
beaten
her
up
six
times
is
now
being
held
in
jail
lest
he
do
it
again,
policemen
can't
go
in,
even
when
she's
willing
to
talk
to
them,
even
when
she's
willing
to
show
them
a
few
things,
we
know
not
what.
now,
perhaps,
i
should
just
sweep
that
--
that
problem
aside
and
pay
--
say
it
isn't
controlling.
but
that's
what's
worrying
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
smith
goes
up
to
the
house
and
mrs.
and
mr.
jones
--
mrs.
jones:
please
come
in.
mr.
jones:
stay
out.
well,
i
mean,
randolph
says
most
people
wouldn't
go
in,
in
those
circumstances.
so
now
mrs.
jones
says:
tell
smith
--
my
husband,
rather:
smith,
you
tell
my
husband
that
there's
a
telephone
call
for
him
at
the
local
pharmacy,
and
so
he
does
so
now
he's
not
there.
and
so
now
they
can
go
in.
i
mean,
that
seems
like
more
fantastic
than
people
entering
the
house
in
the
first
case.
and
so
there
does
seem
to
me
to
be
a
real
problem,
if
you
write
randolph
and
agree
to
it,
as
i
did,
that
you're
going
to
say,
okay,
the
police
can
just
get
him
out
of
the
way
for
a
little
while,
legitimately,
get
him
out
of
the
way,
maybe
there
really
was
a
phone
call,
and
now
they
go
in
the
house.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
i
could
write
that
without
saying
i
was
wrong
in
randolph,
which
i
still
think
i
was
right.
so
therefore
i
--
one
thing
here.
what
about
saying
that
that
〝
stay
out
of
my
house
″
is
at
least
valid
for
a
reasonable
time
thereafter?
and
an
hour
and
a
half
is
not
a
reasonable
time
thereafter,
at
least
when
--
when
the
police
got
him
out
of
the
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
true,
but
can
you
answer
my
straight-faced
question,
which
is
how
can
i
do
this
with
a
straight
face,
both
come
out
one
way
in
randolph
and
say
when
the
police
get
him
out
of
the
way
knowing
about
what
he
doesn't
wan,
that's
all
different.
can
you
explain
how
i
can
do
that
with
a
straight
face?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
there's
--
reading
your
brief
and
the
other,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
case
where
she
wanted
to
talk
to
the
police.
is
it?
the
policeman
says
he
wants
to
get
in
there
because
he's
afraid
a
hostage
--
a
child
is
being
held
hostage.
and
why
wouldn't
that
give
him
grounds
for
--
was
it
an
exigency?
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
he
get
in
on
other
grounds
there?
the
exigent
circumstances,
the
child
might
be
held
hostage.
isn't
that
a
good
ground
for
going
in
immediately
without
a
warrant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
they
say
they
can
do
that.
so
the
problem
is
when
they
came
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
when
they
came
back,
and
she
says
apparently
--
or
what
they
give
the
impression,
as
i
read
it
quickly,
that
it
isn't
a
case
where
when
they
came
back,
she
wanted
particularly
to
give
evidence
to
the
police.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
everything
here
--
the
things
--
the
everything
--
the
search
at
issue
was
a
search
solely
for
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
objecting
party
was
present
and
made
his
objection
known
clearly
and
directly
to
the
officers
seeking
to
enter
the
house?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
little
earlier,
but
he
did.
the
officers
did
not
justify
their
search
on
grounds
of
possible
evidence
destruction.
and
as
far
as
the
record
reveals,
the
officers
might
easily
have
secured
the
premises
and
sought
a
warrant
permitting
them
to
enter.
all
these
factors
are
there,
and
the
other
offsetting
factors,
that
the
officer
--
the
invitation
could
reflect
the
victim's
fear
about
being
left
alone
with
an
abuser.
no,
because
he's
not
there.
it
could
also
indicate
the
availability
of
the
evidence
in
the
form
of
a
willingness
to
speak
that
might
not
otherwise
exist.
as
far
as
we
know,
that
isn't
present.
therefore,
it
fits
totally
within
randolph,
but
for
one
thing:
the
police
themselves
took
him
away.
now,
i
mean,
it's
not
--
it's
not
really
a
subterfuge,
but
it
might
look
like
that
you've
just
eroded
randolph
for
no
reason
to
get
around
your
point
by
saying
at
least
that
known
consent
--
i
mean
known
objection
--
has
enough
force
to
last
for
a
reasonable
time,
which
isn't
the
best
way
of
writing
perhaps
a
fourth
amendment
opinion.
but
it
does
have
the
--
leaves
it
up
the
lower
courts
to
figure
out
what
is,
and
it
maintains
some
life
in
randolph.
okay.
that's
a
fairly
long
question,
but
you
see
where
i'm
going.
and
your
--
your
answer
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
problem,
for
as
long
as
he
can't
enforce
it
--
he's
the
worst
criminal
in
the
world;
right
from
the
house
to
20
years
in
sing-sing.
so
she
can't
right
--
let
anyone
in
the
house,
the
police
department,
for
20
years.
that
can't
be
right.
