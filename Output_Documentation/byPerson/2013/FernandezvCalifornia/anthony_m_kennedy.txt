suppose
her
friend
is
a
forensics
professor
at
the
law
school.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
she
said,
you
know,
i'm
concerned
there
might
be
evidence
of
a
crime
here;
i
don't
want
any
part
of
it,
i
want
you
to
give
me
your
expert
opinion
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
saying
that
the
police
are
different
from
anybody
else.
there's
just
no
--
no
authority
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
next?
what
happens
next
for
ten
hours,
ten
days?
he
was
in
custody
for
500
plus
days
and
for
all
that
time,
the
co-tenant,
the
wife,
cannot
invite
the
police
to
look
for
a
shotgun
where
the
four-year-old
knows
that
it
is
and
she
may
not
know
how
to
handle
the
weapon?
she
can't
get
a
policeman
to
assist
her
for
500
days?
this
is
not
randolph.
this
is
a
vast
extension
of
randolph.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
breyer's
question
was
very
carefully
phrased
to
indicate,
at
least
to
me,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
you're
asking
the
property
owner
to
invoke
a
legal
form
that
is
itself
highly
invasive.
she
doesn't
want
a
warrant.
she
wants
the
police
to
come
in
for
advice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
was
in
jail
for
500-plus
days,
and
you're
saying
that
for
all
that
time,
the
co-occupant
has
no
complete
control
over
the
premises.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
you
say
the
--
the
police
prohibit
him
from
exercising
that
right,
there
was
an
arraignment
before
a
magistrate.
the
judicial
system
ordered
him
--
ordered
him
confined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
property
law
cases
that
you
cite,
pages
24-25
of
your
brief,
i
had
thought
originally
that
this
would
be
the
principal
focus
of
our
decisions
in
these
cases,
but
it's
--
it's
marginally
in
your
favor.
it's
not
really
very
strong.
i
mean,
you
have
an
1839
north
carolina
case
and
the
cjs
case.
there's
just
not
a
lot
of
help
in
property
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
cotenant
has
much
less
authority
to
allow
people
to
enter
if
her
other
cotenant
is
--
is
a
criminal
than
if
he's
a
law-abiding
citizen?
that's
the
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
--
that's
the
result
of
the
way
you
allocate
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
cotenant
who
allows
the
--
the
person
to
enter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
the
law-abiding
citizen
says
i'm
going
away
for
three
days,
don't
let
anybody
in
the
house,
but
the
cotenant
can
overcome
that,
but
not
in
the
case
of
the
--
well,
i'm
interrupting
your
--
your
rebuttal.
