mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
doctrine
of
third-party
consent
is
best
understood
as
establishing
a
rebuttable
presumption.
when
the
police
arrive
at
a
house
at
which
multiple
people
live,
they
can
assume,
according
to
social
custom,
that
if
one
person
grants
consent
to
enter,
that
person
is
speaking
for
everybody
who
lives
in
the
dwelling.
but
when
somebody
is
present
and
tells
the
police
officer
that
he
refuses
consent,
that
presumption
is
reversed.
then
when
the
police
full
well
know
that
one
person
doesn't
have
a
delegated
authority
to
speak
for
the
others,
they
must
respect
the
objection.
and
a
failure
to
do
so
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
in
other
words,
matlock
already
gives
the
police
all
of
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
even
when
people
are
nearby
and
have
a
--
might
have
an
interest
in
objecting,
the
police
can
assume,
as
this
put
--
as
this
court
put
it
in
randolph,
that
asking
that
other
person
wouldn't
make
a
difference
very
often,
and
therefore,
they
can
presume
that
they
would
also
consent
to
the
search.
so
all
we're--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--she
can
invite
them
in,
justice
breyer,
and
the
police,
within
about
15
minutes,
can
get
a
warrant
and
come
right
in
and--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
on
the
basis
that
i
think
that
you've
just
described
that
she
said
there's
essentially--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--okay.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
breyer,
i've
never
seen
a
case
like
that,
but
there'd
be
two
things
i
would
say
if
one
arose.
one
is,
under
coolidge
--
under
the
coolidge
case,
she
could
simply
go
get
the
things
in
the
closet
and
give
it
to
the
police
officer.
and
that
would
take
care
of
the
problem,
as
justice
thomas
pointed
out
in
his
separate
opinion
in
randolph.
in
addition,
she
may
well
be
able
to
invite
the
police
into
the
dwelling
sometimes,
but
that's
very
different
than
what's
going
on
here.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
no,
i'm
sorry.
then
i
misunderstood.
in
that
case,
it
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
police
to
come
in.
but
i
think
the
hypotheticals
that
one
might
think
of
and
that
can
arise,
as
certainly
the
other
side
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
leave
out
three
very
important
things
that
i
think
you
need
to
ask
under
the
fourth
amendment
social
customs
analysis.
the
first
is
you
need
to
remember
that
we're
asking
about
whether
a
stranger
--
because
the
police
officer
can
step
into
the
shoes
of
what
a
stranger
would
be
allowed
to
do
--
whether
a
stranger
would
feel
like
that
was
acceptable
reason
to
come
into
the
house,
not
just
because
they'd
been
invited
by
the
wife
but
vis-a-vis
what
the
objector
had
said.
and
it's
very
different
when
you
ask
about
a
stranger
as
opposed
to
what
the
other
side
would
like
to
say,
a
neighbor
or--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
i
think
--
that
was
just
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
justice
alito.
a
friend
is
different
than
a
police
officer.
remember
what
the
objection
said
in
this
case.
it
said,
you
can't
come
in.
and
he
said,
i
know
my
rights.
and
so,
translated
as
best
we
can
translate
that
kind
of
a
statement
to
the
social
setting
that
we're
supposed
to
translate
it
to,
it's
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
it's
still
very--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
it's
very
different--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no.
i
think
the
police
can
stand
into
the
shoes,
as
this
court
put
it
in
jardines,
justice
kennedy,
of
a
stranger.
they
are
not
a
friend.
they
are
able
--
they
are
able
to
do
what
a
stranger
caller
could
do
at
the
house,
and
that's
a
very
different
question
than
what
a
friend
might
do.
and
there's
two
other
things
that
i
think
are
critical--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
the
ordinary
presumption,
but
what
this
court
held--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
may
be
a
property
right,
but
it's
trumped
by
the
constitutional
right
of
another
resident
of
the
building
to
forbid
the
police
for
entering
without
a
warrant.
that's
the
holding
in
randolph.
and
i
understand
there's
a
debate
on
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
because
it's
this
court's
precedent
and
no
one
on
the
other
side
is
asking
to
have
it
overturned.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that's
a
fair
way
to
put
the
question
here,
which
is
once
somebody
does
exactly
what
this
court
said
they
had
a
right
to
do
in
randolph,
which
is
say,
you
cannot
come
in
my
house,
what
happens
next?
and
our
proposal
in
this
case
is
that
the
police
cannot
nullify
that
objection
simply
by
involuntarily
removing
the
person
from
the
premises.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
fairly
characterize
the
case,
there
is
physical
presence
in
this
case.
mr.
randolph
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
fernandez
was
physically
present
and
enforced
--
invoked
his
randolph
rights.
so
the
question
is
what
happens
next?
and
my--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
two
things,
justice
kennedy.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
objection
for
randolph
has
to
last
as
long
as
the
police
make
it
impossible
for
somebody
to
enforce
it.
so
once
they
remove
you
and
make
it
impossible
for
you
even
to
camp
on
doorstep,
which
is
what
the
other
side
would
require,
at
a
bare
minimum,
if
randolph
means
anything,
it
has
to
mean
that.
to
answer
your
hypothetical
directly,
the
police
can
simply
get
a
warrant.
if
you
look
at
the
lower
court
cases,
they
all
arise
immediately
after
an
arrest,
which
is
why--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
she
wants
that,
she
has
numerous
ways
to
help
the
police,
justice
kennedy.
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
of
many
examples,
just
to
be
fair,
where
by
providing
oral
information
about
what
she
might
be
worried
about,
what
she
might
think
is
in
the
house,
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
already
been
arrested,
that
would
not
provide
probable
cause.
as
i've
said,
i
have
not
seen
such
a
case
that
has
ever
actually
arisen.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
of
course
not.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
i'm
simply
answering
--
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
answer
the
practical
question
that
justice
breyer
and
justice
kennedy
have
raised
about
what
if
the
police
can't
come
in
under
the
really
fallacious
theory
that
she's
consenting
not
only
on
her
behalf--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--remember,
there
are
two
people
that
have
rights
in
that
scenario,
her
and
the
defendant
--
or
the
suspect.
and
what
the
constitution
says
is
that
searches
of
homes
presumably
have
to
be
done
under
warrant.
now,
if
somebody
consents
and
the
police
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
that
consent
speaks
not
only
for
the
person
standing
in
front
of
them
but
also
for
an
absent
person,
they
can
enter,
and
that's
what
happens
most
of
the
time.
but
in
the
rare
occasion
where
somebody
says,
i
invoke
my
rights,
i
want
to
insist
upon
the
warrant
requirement,
the
police
ought
to
do
that.
i
don't
think
it's
too
much
to
ask.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
the
police
can
do
that
and
presumably,
no
matter
what
you
hold
in
this
case,
they
will
continue
to
do
that.
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
they
will
continue
to
get
valid
consent.
the
only
question
you
have
in
this
case
is
what
about
the
rare
circumstance
where
somebody
invokes
his
rights.
in
randolph
there
--
i
understand
what
you
said
in
king,
but
in
randolph
the
court
specifically
referred
to
the
fourth
amendment's
partiality
towards
searches
of
the
home
conducted
pursuant
to
a
warrant.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
try
to
walk
you
through
it,
because
i
think
it
is
vital
here.
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
the
holding
of
randolph
says
when
the
other
tenant
objects,
then
the
police
cannot
come
in.
so
i
think
the
question
that
you
need
to
ask
in
this
case
for
social
expectations
purposes
and
it's
critical
that
it's
framed
the
right
way,
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
three
things
i
was
mentioning
earlier.
you
have
to
ask
whether
a
stranger,
under
these
circumstances,
would
feel
like
he
had
consent,
not
just
from
the
person
standing
in
front
of
him
but
on
behalf
of
the
others,
to
conduct
a
general
search
of
the
dwelling.
even
if
you
think
that
somebody
coming
back
would
think
they
could
be
invited
in
because
the
objector
is
no
longer
gone,
that
is
leagues
away
from
what
the
police
asked
to
do
here
and
what
they
are
contending
they
had
the
right
to
do,
which
is
conduct
a
general
search
of
the
premises.
and
on
page
7
of
the
reply
brief,
we
point
out
again
and
again
how
this
court
has
distinguished
between
mere
entry
and
search.
and
the
third
thing--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
i
could
just
put
it
on
the
table,
and
then
i'll
answer
your
question.
the
third
thing
that's
critical
is
what
i
mentioned
a
moment
earlier,
the
nature
of
the
objection
here.
the
nature
of
the
objection
isn't
simply
you
can't
come
in.
it
isn't
i'm
busy.
you
can
come
back
later.
it
is
i
--
i
know
my
rights.
and
i
think
translated
into
a
social
setting
with
a
stranger,
that
means
i
have
private
things
in
here
that
i
do
not
want
you
to
see.
and
would
somebody
coming
back
an
hour
later
think
that
over
that
kind
of
an
objection,
they
could
get
consent
from
the
other
person
to
search
through
the
belongings,
i
think
that's
the
question
you
have
to
ask.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
about
pretext?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
all
fairness,
i
don't
know
that
it
does.
it
certainly
doesn't
help
me
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
we're
not
establishing
any
bad
--
or
not
alleging
any
bad
faith.
i
think
the
government
and
the
state
have
both
pointed
out,
quite
rightly,
that
this
court
has
shunned
pretext
inquiries
throughout
the
fourth
amendment,
and
so
i'm
not
sure
that
you
want
to
go
down
that
road
here.
but,
justice
sotomayor,
that
points
out
a
very
big
problem.
their
rule
is
a
recipe
for
the
evisceration
of
randolph
because
as
soon
as--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--all
you
have
to
do
is
arrest
and
remove
them,
and
that's
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
even
if
you
didn't
have
the
authority
to
arrest
and
remove
them,
the
police
always
have
the
authority
to
exert
control
over
the
situation
when
they
arrive
at
a
dwelling
and
to
say
to
a
homeowner,
sir,
would
you
please
come
out
to
the
curb
and
talk
to
me
here,
and
i'm
going
to
separate
you
from
the
other
tenant.
under
their
theory,
even
that
ordinary,
boring
part
of
police
procedure
extinguishes
somebody's
randolph
rights
immediately.
and
so
their
rule
simply
gives
the
police
total
control,
whether
for
good
faith
or
for
bad
faith
--
and
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
want
to
have
to
try
to
answer
that
question
--
to
immediately
extinguish
someone's
randolph's
rights
the
moment
they're
invoked.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
i'd
agree
with
what
you're
saying,
justice
ginsburg.
if
somebody
is
convicted
of
a
crime
and
then
imprisoned,
i
think
they
lose
their
equal
ownership
over
the
dwelling
that
is
a
lynchpin--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
sure
that
a
charge
would
be
enough
to
take
--
take
one
out
of
the
social
setting
where
one
would
assume
that
somebody's
objections
still
stood.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
kennedy,
at
least
until
he's
convicted,
i
don't
think
he
does.
now,
you
don't
have
to
go
--
if
that
really
is
what's
troubling
you,
let
me
tell
you
something
that
i
think
you
can
decide
the
case
on
a
more
narrow
ground.
it's
enough
to
decide
this
case,
and
indeed,
the
vast
majority
of
lower
court
cases,
to
say
so
long
as
the
police
make
it
impossible
for
somebody
to
enforce
the
randolph
objection,
either
by
being
at
their
home
to
protect
it
on
their
own,
or
at
least
to
have
a
conversation
with
the
cotenant
to
try
to
work
it
out
amongst
themselves,
which
is,
remember,
exactly
what
randolph
says,
is
that
voluntary
accommodation
has
to
be
the
solution.
so
at
least
with
--
you
know,
at
least
in
a
case
like
this
where
there's
an
hour
and
somebody's
gone,
the
police
return
right
away,
it
is
virtually
impossible.
i
think
there
their
objection
has
to
stand.
after
500
days,
if
you
really
wanted
to
at
least
leave
it
open
for
another
case,
you
could
say
there
we
could
imagine
that
he
could
have
a
conversation
with
the
cotenant,
try
to
work
out
the
solution
to
the
problem,
and
that
she
could
speak
for
him
solely
to
the
police
at
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
that
situation,
the
police
would
probably
do
well
to
do
exactly
what
they
did
here,
which
is
remove
him
from
the
premises,
arrest
him,
and
then
all
they,
again,
have
to
do
is
get
a
warrant.
in
los
angeles
county,
it
takes
them
15
minutes
on
average
to
get
a
telephonic
warrant.
and
under
illinois--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
to
be
fair,
in
this
court's
cases,
they've
--
sometimes
you've
said
--
and
we've
quoted
those
other
cases
in
the
reply
brief
--
that
the
administrative
efficiency
is
not
a
good
enough
reason
to
dispense
with
the
word
〝
requirement
″.
i
think
every
one
of
these
cases
is
context-specific,
and
the
one
thing
that
the
fourth
amendment
has,
i
think,
meant
in
this
court
is
that
the
home
is
special,
and
that
when
the
police
want
to
enter
a
home
--
florida
against
jardines
last
term,
i
think,
also
fairly
said
that
we
prefer
warrants.
i
think
jardines
is
actually
a
very
useful
case
to
think
about
in
thinking
about
the
social
expectation
problem
here,
because
the
very
same
kind
of
hypotheticals
that
--
some
of
which
i've
received
today
and
the
other
side
is
raising
about
a
neighbor
or
a
friend
coming
back,
those
were
the
government's
exact
arguments
in
jardines,
that
somebody
can
come
to
the
front
door
and
knock
and
ask
if
anybody's
there.
and
so
why
can't
a
police
officer
do
the
same?
and
this
court
was
careful
at
page
1417
of
that
decision
to
say
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
a
stranger
can
come
onto
the
premises
with
trained
dogs
to
explore
the
curtilage
of
somebody's
house.
and
that's
a
very
odd
question
to
ask,
i
think,
because
very
few
strangers
are
going
to
do
that.
but
that's
the
question
this
court
insisted
on
asking.
and
i
think
translated
to
this
case
a
version,
the
same
kind
of
question
is
what
the
court
has
to
do
here,
is
ask
a
stranger,
after
being
told,
i
invoke
my
rights.
i
want
to
keep
what's
inside
private
from
you.
i
don't
consent
to
any
search,
whether
a
stranger
coming
back
an
hour
later
would
think
that
when
they
asked
the
other
tenant
can
i
come
inside
and
search,
that
that
tenant--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--which--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
know
that
it
was
any
more
than
randolph.
i
mean,
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
property
rights
inform
the
fourth
amendment
analysis.
they
don't
utterly
control
it,
but
that
the
sanctity
of
the
home
is
something
the
fourth
amendment
treats
as
special.
and
i
think
the
property
right
that
mr.
fernandez
had
here
was
--
which
is
undiminished
by
his
arrest,
and
the
other
side
hasn't
disputed
that
it
--
hasn't
disputed
this,
is
that
he
had
a
property
right
to
keep
the
police
out
of
his
dwelling
absent
a
warrant.
and
all
we're
asking
is
for
that
right
to
be
preserved,
at
least
so
long
as
the
police
themselves
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
enforce
that
right.
literally
impossible
for
him
to
enforce
that
right.
the
other
side's
theory,
even
taking
away
the
police
arrest,
i
think
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
would
require
somebody
to
basically
pitch
a
tent
on
their
front
steps
in
order
to
--
to
prevent
the
police
from
entering
without
a
warrant.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
fair
enough,
justice
kennedy.
but
at
the
time
the
search
was
made,
it
was
only
an
hour
later
while
the
police
had
custody
over
him
before
any
of
that
happened.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
testimony
to
that
effect,
justice
ginsburg.
and
so
what
we're
left
with
is
the
state's
brief,
which
has
primarily
the
administrative
efficiency
argument
that
mr.
chief
justice
has
made.
i
understand
in
--
in
maryland
against
king,
this
court
took
that
in
consideration,
but
i
think
in
numerous
other
fourth
amendment
cases,
the
court
has
said
that's
not
enough.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
those
other
permutations,
you
have,
first
of
all,
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine.
but
even
short
of
that,
you
have
illinois
versus
mcarthur,
which
allows
the
police
to
have
everybody
exit
a
dwelling
and
stabilize
the
situation
until
they
can
get
a
warrant.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
was
just
--
in
your
hypothetical,
there
might
have
been
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
breyer,
i
understand
that's
--
that's
a
concern,
but
there
are
two
very
easy
ways
for
the
police
to
deal
with
that.
one
is
coolidge.
they
can
say
--
you
can
say:
get
the
things
you're
worried
about
and
bring
them
to
us,
and
the
problem
is
solved.
alternatively,
the
police
can
say:
thanks
for
telling
us.
i'm
glad
you
did.
i
want
to
help
you.
your
husband
has
objected
or
your
boyfriend
has
objected
to
us
searching.
could
you
please
step
outside
for
15
minutes,
you
and
the
little
boy
step
outside
for
15
minutes,
we'll
call
a
judge
and
get
an
official
warrant
and
we'll
be
inside
in
15
minutes.
meanwhile,
we'll
protect
you.
i
don't
think
that's
too
much
to
ask
to
preserve
the
privacy
and
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
other
questions,
i
think
i'll
stop
here
and
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
i'd
--
i
think
i'd
like
to
use
as
my
jumping
off
point
justice
breyer's
last
question
where
he
went
through,
i
believe,
the
elements
in
his
concurrence.
they're
all
present
in
this
case.
and
--
and
as
to
the
test,
the
reasonableness
test,
if
you
have
any
qualms
about
that
being
the
test,
you
can
do
the
case
even
more
narrowly
and
it
would
take
care,
again,
of
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
have
arisen
post
randolph,
and
simply
say
the
objection
has
to
be
valid
so
long
as
it's
impossible
for
him
to
enforce
it.
so
long
as
it's
impossible
for
him
to
be
physically
present
and
enforcing
it,
through
no
voluntary
action
of
his
own,
at
least
then
the
objection
has
to
be
valid.
and
the
lockbox
example
the
other
side
gives,
even
that
isn't
available
to
mr.
fernandez.
once
he
objected
and
knew
the
police
were
interested
in
his
dwelling,
he
didn't
have
an
opportunity
even
to
do
that.
if
he
had
private
papers
--
remember,
we
have
to
think
of
all
different
kinds
of
cases
that
might
arise
for
--
where
the
police
were
seeking
consent.
he
couldn't
even
take
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
kennedy,
because
if
he's
a
law-abiding
citizen,
the
police
couldn't
take
him
away
and
he
could
stay
there
or,
at
a
minimum,
the
police
might
be
able
to
reposition
him
as
i
think
they've
acknowledged
that
occurred--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i
--
but
to
be
intellectually
coherent
you
might
say,
no,
even
then
the
police
couldn't
override
it.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
police
could
then
think
--
if
somebody
said,
i
object
to
you
entering
the
dwelling
and
doing
--
doing
a
--
a
general
search.
now,
i
have
a
business
trip
next
week
for
three
days.
i
want
you
to
let
--
you
know,
i
still
object
and
do
not
want
any
warrantless
general
searches
of
my
home.
i
think
there,
the
police
would
have
a
hard
time
arguing
that
they
had
valid
third-party
consent
from
the
person
in
the
dwelling.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
because
i
think
once
he's
imprisoned,
you
might
say
he
has
a
new
domicile,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
i
think
he's
lost
ownership
control
over
that
house.
but
i
think
what
this
case
reduces
to,
justice
kennedy,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
is
really
what
respect
is
owed
this
court's
randolph
decision.
i
think
the
questions
have
adequately
pointed
out
that
if
you
adopt
the
other
side's
position
on
the
facts
of
this
case
where
the
police
forcibly
remove
somebody
to
the
dwelling,
randolph
reduces
to
nothing.
literally
nothing.
it's
also
about
what
respect
is
owed
to
somebody
invoking
somebody's
constitutional
rights.
in
another
case
last
term,
this
--
a
plurality
of
this
court
went
to
lengths
to
explain
how
important
it
is
that
people
invoke
their
constitutional
rights.
and,
presumably,
when
they
do,
the
police
need
to
respect
it.
we
live
in
a
constitutional
system
that
deals
with
individual
dignity,
not
just
of
homeowners,
but
of
people
who
enforce
--
who
--
who
raise
their
rights
and
they
need
to
be
respected.
now,
you
have
left
these
--
you
know,
if
there
were
insuperable
practical
problems
to
enforcing
randolph
in
this
setting,
maybe
you
would
want
to
reduce
it
to
nothing
and
effectively
overrule
it.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
good
reason
to
do
that
because
i
think
you
have
a
very
easy
rule
that
will
resolve
almost
all
the
cases
that
i've
offered
you,
and
it
will
deal
with
--
by
exigent
circumstances
doctrine,
by
the
warrant
--
ease
of
getting
a
warrant,
by
illinois
v.
mcarthur,
which
lets
the
police
bring
somebody
outside,
all
of
those
things
can
very
easily
deal,
i
think,
with
the
concerns
that
the
court
has
before
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
think
when
randolph
said
it
was
being
formalistic,
it
didn't
mean
we're
establishing
a
meaningless
right.
and
so,
yes,
the
facts
of
that
case
where
somebody
who's
physically
present,
the
facts
of
this
case
begin
with
somebody
who's
physically
present,
and
i
think
this
court
ought
to
treat
its
opinion
as
having
some
genuine
meaning
in
the
real
world
that
you're
not--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--two
things,
justice
alito.
first,
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
remember,
they
come
back
earlier
solely
looking
for
evidence--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
would.
and
there,
i
think,
it
is
not
too
much
disrespectful
to
say
to
her,
i'd
like
to
help
you,
we
will
help
you.
your
boyfriend
has
objected.
let
us
just
get
a
warrant
and
we'll
be
right
with
you
and
we'll
help
you.
i
don't
think
that's
too
disrespectful.
it
respects
her
rights
and
the
constitutional
system
under
which
we
live.
