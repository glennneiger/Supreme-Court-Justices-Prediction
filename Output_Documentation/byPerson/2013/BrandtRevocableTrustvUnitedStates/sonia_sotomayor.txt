let's
take
this
in
a
normal
easement
situation.
i
have
an
easement
to
go
through
your
backyard
to
get
to
the
street.
can
i
assign
that
easement
to
another
person
so
that
the
person
who
buys
my
home
can
now
walk
through
your
backyard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
wrong
with
the
concept
that
when
this
land
was
given
to
you
as
a
railroad
right-of-way,
when
it's
abandoned,
that
the
railroad,
in
essence,
under
1912,
and
under
the
1922
act,
that
you
are
giving
that
easement
to
the
u.s.
to
use
as
a
right-of-way?
and
so,
whether
it's
a
trail
or
a
highway
or
any
of
the
other
items
that
are
specified
in
the
statute
that
that
easement
is
continuing
to
be
used
by
the
person
who
gave
it,
which
was
originally
the
u.s.
your
patent
was
given
subject
to
that
easement,
so
that
right-of-way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
was
the
language
of
the
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
that
the
exact
language?
i
thought
it
was
for
right-of-way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
joint
appendix?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
too
many
briefs.
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
1875
act,
what
was
given
to
the
railroad
was
a
right-of-way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
as
i'm
seeing
the
1875
grant,
it
was
the
right-of-way
through
public
lands.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
on
easements.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
there
any
statute
of
limitations?
would
all
of
this
be
subject
to
the
apa,
or
--
or
a
claim
for
damages
against
the
u.s.?
