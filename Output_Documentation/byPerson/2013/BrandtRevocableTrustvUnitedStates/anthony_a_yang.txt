mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute,
its
legislative
history,
the
surrounding
statutory
context
which
includes
section
912
as
well
as
1906
and
1909
acts
and
this
court's
decisions
construing
the
1875
act
including
section
4
which
predated
great
northern
show
that
the
united
states
retains
the
reversionary
interest
in
the
surface
of
the
land
of
right-of-ways
granted
to
railroads--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--there
is
also
other
portions
of
the
brief.
i
would
refer
the
court,
for
instance,
to
footnote
4
where
the
government
said
there
would
be
a
separate
question
raised
about
whether
a
patent
holder
subsequently
who
obtains
the
patent
after
the
grant
of
right-of-way
would
take
this
government
interest.
and
the
court
--
the
government
said
in
fact
that
would
raise
different
questions.
the
court
recognized
that
on
pages
--
the
last
two
pages
of
its
opinion,
it
specifically
limited
its
judgment
to
situations
where
the
government
retained
interest
in
the
entire
surrounding
parcel
and,
in
fact,
modified
the
judgment
below
which
enjoined
the
railroad
from
oil
drilling
simply
to
apply
to
that.
not
only
that,
the
court
was
writing
on
--
the
government
didn't
cite,
for
instance--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
i
think--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
do
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
we
have
here.
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
the
right-of-way,
which
is
a
statutory
term,
congress
could
have
used
"easement";
it
could
have
used
"fee".
it
did
not.
it
uses
a
special
statutory
term
which
has
accumulated
meaning
over
time,
particularly,
in
the
railroad
context.
and
in
that
context,
the
court
was
deciding
whether
it
was
in
the
nature
of
an
easement,
which
as
our
subject
heading
said,
it's
in
the
nature
of
an
easement.
but
that's
vis-a-vis
the
united
states--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--with
respect
to
the
mineral
lands.
and,
in
fact,
the
shift
that,
justice
kagan,
you
were
talking
about
is
a
shift
about
subsidies.
it
was
a
shift
of
subsidy
away
from
these
lavish
land
grants.
and
when
congress
was
stopping
that
--
that
lavish
grant
to
railroads,
it
made
no
sense
to
construe
the
act
with
respect
to
the
mineral
rights,
which
the
court
said
were
--
were
mineral
riches.
why
would
congress
do
that
when
it
was
cutting
back
on--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--it's
a
right-of-way.
and,
in
fact,
the
government's
brief
also
said
that
with
respect
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
9
--
with
respect
to
the
surface
--
the
control
--
under
any
of
the
theories,
even
under
the
easement
theory,
which
i
don't
believe
is
a
true
common
law
easement,
the
railroad's
control
of
the
surface
was
complete.
and
then
we
went
on
further
--
and
this
is
on
pages
36
to
37
--
that
said
it
was
a
fact
that
the
right-of-way
has
some
of
the
attributes
of
a
fee,
and
those
included
exclusive
and
perpetual
occupation
and
remedies--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--and
so,
again,
if
we
were
to
rewrite
our
brief,
we
would
certainly
do
so
much
more
carefully
now.
but
i
think
that
the
way
that
you
read
the
brief
is
the
way
that
you
read
opinions,
which
is
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
decided,
particularly
because
footnote
4,
and
this
court's
opinion
responding
to
footnote
4,
made
clear
that
they
were
only
addressing
mineral
rights
where
the
united
states
held
the
surrounding
parcel.
and
--
and
that's
particularly
true
because
this
court
had
already
construed
section
4
of
the
1875
act
before
great
northern
in
stalker
and
in
steinke.
and
in
stalker,
the
court
held
that
the
subject
to
--
this
is
on
page
154
--
a
patent
was
subject
to
the
railroad
rights
acquired
by
approval.
that's
the
approval
in
section
4,
in
the
subject
to
language
in
section
4.
"upon
approval,
the
grounds
so
selected
were
segregated
from
the
public
lands
and
the
required
material
to
withdraw
the
land
granted
from
the
market.
"
and
then
the
court
goes
on,
and
this
is
on
page
154
again,
"the
later
patent",
the
patent
issued
to
a
settler.
even
though
the
local
land
office
forgot
to
or
omitted
to
mark
the
right-of-way
on
the
land
plats,
the
subsequent
patent
was
inoperative
to
pass
title
to
those
later
patentholders.
and
then
in
steinke
--
this
is
1922
--
the
court
followed
stalker
and
said,
"the
approved
map
under
section
4
is
the
equivalent
of
a
patent.
"
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
citing
stalker,
that
the
later
patent
was
inoperative
to
pass
title.
and
i
think
it's
important,
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
cited
to
interior's
regulations.
in
stalker,
the
court
quoted
at
length
the
regulations
from
1888,
which,
although
the
court
suggested
that
in
great
northern
those
were
the
first
regulations,
they
actually
weren't.
there
were
prior
regulations
in
1878
which
discuss
nothing
about
the
nature
of
the
fee.
and
those,
unfortunately,
are
hard
to
find.
they
are
in
senate
executive
document
30,
45th
congress,
third
session,
1879.
so
--
but
the
regs
that
the
petitioners
now
rely
on
were
specifically
referenced
by
the
court,
including
the
regs
that
say
the
disposition
of
the
land
surrounding
the
right-of-way
is
subject
to
the
right-of-way.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
we
don't
have
good
numbers,
actually,
on
that.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
would
be
any
common
law
cases.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
but
in
this
context--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--in
this
context--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--even
with
respect
to
the
pre-1871
statutes,
the
court
would
sometimes--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
--
they
did.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
they
sometimes
referred
to
them
as
easements.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
i
know
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
didn't
refer
to
those
cases.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
we
might
have
cited
the
cases
in
our
brief.
we
didn't
refer
to
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
but
there
are
some,
but
the
point
was
they
were
trying
to
discuss
the
nature
of
a
statutory
right-of-way.
congress
did
not
use
the
term
"easement",
it
did
not
use
the
term
"fee".
and
so
the
court
has
been
using
common
law
terms
which
don't
fit
perfectly
to
describe
certain
kinds
of--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--yes.
there
are--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--there
are
at
least
four
reasons.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
oh,
yes.
there's
statutory
and
case
law
authority.
i
would
start
with
stalker
and
steinke,
which
specifically
say
that
when
you
have
approved
the
map,
it's
equivalent
to
a
patent,
and
then
therefore,
any
parcel
subject
--
is
--
conveyed
subject
to
the
patent
or
the
right-of-way,
which
means
you
don't
get
any
interest
at
least
in
the
surface
of
the
right-of-way.
so
this
--
those
cases
have
never
been
overruled,
one.
two,
congress
in
1906,
and
this
is
--
this
isn't
significant.
this
is
at
page
--
section
940
at
page
7
--
6a
and
7a
of
our
brief.
congress
said
that
each
and
every
grant
of
right-of-way
under
this
1875
act
--
each
and
every
one
--
"shall
be
declared
forfeited
if
they
haven't
been
constructed.
"
and
--
this
is
important
--
"the
united
states
resumes
the
full
title
to
the
lands
covered
thereby,
free
and
discharged
from
such
easement--
"
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
but
it
reflects
congress's
understanding
of
what
the
1875
act--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
when
we're--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--this
court
did
in
great
northern.
in
fact,
this
court--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--okay.
that's
possible,
but
what
we're
talking
about
is
great
northern.
and,
in
fact,
great
northern
quotes
this
language
of
section
940.
the
very
next
section
goes
on
to
say
that
the
government's
interests
shall
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
land
conveyed
by
the
united
states
previously,
which
was
subject
to
the
right-of-way.
so
that
section
itself
shows
that
starting
in
1906,
and
that's
both
1906
and
1909,
congress
understood
that
the
government
had
a
reversionary
interest.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
sure.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
again,
we
don't
know
because
the
way
that
these
things
are
disposed
of,
there
has
not
been
a
centralized
way
of
tracking
it.
it
could
be
a
significant
amount,
because
the
1875
act
rights-of-ways
were
at
least
in
number
the
most
numerous.
it's
hard
to
know
about
mileage
because
the
specific
land
grants
were
often
quite
long,
but
in
terms
--
there
were
at
least
a
significant
number
of
1875
act
rights
of
ways.
and
so
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
why
a
good
lawyer
would
not
have
great
pause
about
saying
that
you
got
the
surface
interests.
you
have
stalker
and
steinke.
you
have
the
section
940,
which
was
enacted
in
1906
and
1909.
you
have
section
922
--
section
912,
which
was
enacted
in
1922,
which
the
court
has
already
discussed,
which
shows
that
whenever
there
is
a
forfeit,
the
united
states'
interest
reverts
first
to
roads
and
then
to
municipalities,
and
if
there
was
anything
left
it
would
go
to
a
land
owner.
that,
you
know,
was
unquestioned
it
appears
until
--
at
least
with
the
surface
interests
until
the
mid-1980s,
for
60
years.
the
municipalities
and
roads
were--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
think
it's
telling--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
think
it's
telling
that
between
1922
and
the
mid-1980s
this
issue
does
not
appear
to
have
arisen.
it
has
arisen
only
with
respect
to--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--and
then
when
the
city
takes
the
road
and
when
the
municipality
--
excuse
me
--
when
the
municipality
takes
the
right
of
way
no
one
complained
for
60
years?
i
mean,
this
is
the
background
of
the
law.
this
is
going
to
be--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--the
amicus
brief
of--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--again,
we
don't
have
good
numbers
on
how
often.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
a
significant
amount
of
time,
because
the
--
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
council
on
state
legislatures,
they
explain
this.
this
is--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--your
honor,
i
can't
speculate
on
numbers.
i
just
don't
have
--
it
would
be
not
appropriate
for
me
for
the
united
states
to
speculate
on
numbers.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
not
correct
because
it
needs
to
be
qualified.
after
great
northern,
interior
has
concluded
in
amerada
hess,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
the
subsurface
interests
would
go
to
the
patentee,
but
with
respect
to
the
surface
interests,
that
has
not
been
the
case.
in
fact,
until
1984
is
the
first
case
that
i
have
seen
in
a
case
that
let
--
that
was
the
counterpart
to
the
oregon
short
line
case
that
we
cite
that
led
to
the
decision
here.
it
just
wasn't
disputed
about
the
surface
interest.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
they
agree
with
our
brief.
we
don't
always--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
we
have
been
in
close
consultation
with
the
department
of
interior
and
they
signed
off
on
this
brief.
the
agency
that
is
at
issue
here
is
actually
agriculture
because
agriculture
is
the
forest
service
which
has
the
lands.
i
think--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
think
that's
maybe
a
little
unfair,
justice
scalia.
i
think
government
is
giving
the
court
its
view
of
the
law
here.
we
are
interpreting
it.
multiple
agencies
have
been
consulted
and
we've
been
trying
to
come
to
grips
with
the
court's
conflicting,
you
know,
language.
if
you
take
language
in
the
abstract
and
you
divorce
it
from
the
context
of
the
case,
the
court's
decisions
are
conflicting,
but
when
you
look
at
the
context
of
the
case,
you
look
at
great
northern
with
respect
to
saying
that
the
subsurface
interests,
the
mineral
interests
are
like
an
easement
with
respect
to
the
united
states
vis-a-vis
the
railroad,
but
then
you
have
stalker
and
steinke
saying
that
when
under
section
4
of
the
act
--
it's
an
authoritative
construction
of
section
4
of
the
act.
when
you
approve
a
map
of
a
railroad
under
section
4,
it
is
tantamount
to
a
patent
and
thereafter
a
subsequent
patent
does
not
confer
an
interest
on
a
patentee?
those
cases
are
reconciled,
we
think,
by
acknowledging
that
stalker
and
steinke
control
at
least
with
respect
to
the
surface
interests,
and
then
with
respect
to
the
subsurface
interests,
great
northern
clearly
says
that,
at
least
vis-a-vis
the
united
states
and
the
railroad
where
there
is
no
third-parties
involved
that
is
deemed
to
be
like
an
easement
that
would
not
give
a
subsurface
interest.
and
there
is
real
important
reasons
to
distinguish
between
the
subsurface
and
the
surface
with
respect
to
rights
of
way.
surface
for
the
right
of
way
is
what's
important.
it's
critical.
you
need
to
have
an
artery
that
connects
various
parcels
of
land.
that
was
true
back
when
1875
was
enacted
and
it's
true
now
with
respect
to
highways
and
other
uses
that
the
government
might
put
its
land
to.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
and
that
was
true
both
in
stalker
and
in
steinke
with
respect
to
the
subsequent
patents.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
you
would
have
to
--
i
think
if
you
had
a
good
lawyer,
the
good
lawyer
would
say,
look,
we've
got
--
there
is
uncertainty
here.
you've
got
stalker
and
steinke,
which
says
you
get
no
interest.
you
have
great
northern,
which
doesn't
address
interest
that
pass
to
third
parties.
it
only
addresses
the
interest
that
the
railroad
has,
and
it
says
there
is
no
mineral
rights.
and
then
you
have
congress
in
1906,
1909,
1922,
and
more
recently
in
1988,
doubling
down
and
saying,
you
know,
the
united
states'
interest
goes
to
roads
first.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate.
at
least
since
1922,
the
government
has
disposed
of
--
or
congress,
i
should
say,
has
directed
the
government
to
dispose
of
its
reversionary
interests
first
to
roads,
and
that
remains
true
today.
and
then
also
from
1922
until
1988,
it
was
supposed
to
go
to
any
municipality,
any
land
within
a
municipality
goes
to
the
municipality;
and
then
third,
it
would
go
to
any
land
owner
of
the
surrounding
parcel
that
was
paying
the
interest
subject
to
the
right
of
way.
now,
of
course,
you
know,
congress
is
free
to
choose
to
change
its
decision
about
how
to
dispose
of
u.s.
government
interests
to
any
government
property.
there
is
no
vested
interest
in
that.
and
i
think
what
we
are
trying
to
say
in
our
brief
is
that
petitioner
asks
the
court
essentially
to
nullify
a
significant
--
significant
enactments
by
congress.
it
would
nullify--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--that
was
townsend,
which
was
dictum.
we
told
the
court
that
townsend
was
dictum.
in
townsend,
the
dispute
was
by
a
railroad
who
got
a
decree
from
a
state
court
saying
it
had
the
right
of
way.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
oh,
i'm
sorry,
stringer.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no,
no,
we
are
not
relying
on
--
we
are
relying
on
stalker
and
steinke,
which
are
1875
act
holdings.
it's
this
court
construing
the
very
statute
that
we're
talking
about,
section
4,
which
is
the
very
section
that
the
petitioner
--
now,
it
would
be
kind
of
remarkable
to
read
language
in
great
northern
which
addressed
a
different
question
in
which
the
government
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
what
interest
would
transfer
to
a
patentee.
the
court
specifically
limited
its
decision
so
it
wouldn't
reach
that
issue.
and
then
it
sub
silentio
overruled
two
decisions
by
this
court
on
the
very
statute
decided
30
years
earlier
when
the
court
was
closer
to
the
1875
act?
that
would
be
a
pretty
remarkable
thing,
i
think.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that,
no,
stalker
and
steinke
remain
good
law,
even
if
you
characterize
the
right
of
way
as
having
attributes
of
an
easement
because
it's
clear
it
can't
be
a
common
law
easement.
i
don't
think
that
even
--
petitioner
may
be
able
to
dispute
this
--
but
a
common
law
easement,
as
this
court
has
explained,
would
not
give
as
traditionally
framed
exclusive
or
perpetual
occupation
to
the
railroad.
it
would
not
give
the
remedy
of
the
fee.
all
those
are
very
practical,
real
rights
that
would
have
to
be
conferred
that
would
be
greater
than
a
mere
common
law
easement.
and
that's
true
back
in
1871,
and
it's
true
in
1875,
and
we
said
it
was
true
in
our
brief
to
this
court.
we
said
as
an
easement,
you
know,
the
fact
that
it
has
some
of
the
attributes
of
a
fee,
including
exclusive
or
perpetual
occupation
and
the
remedies
of
a
fee
and
not
an
easement,
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
box
of
what
we
were
talking
about
in
that
case.
and
so,
again,
i
think
you
need
to
read
it
in
context.
i
agree
that
if
you
just
take
great
northern
and
look
at
it
without
peeling
back
the
hood
a
little
bit,
there's
language
that,
you
know,
would
lead--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--one
was
before--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
not
after
great
northern.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
but
justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
rely
on
these
labels
of
limited
fee
and
easement
too
strongly.
that's
what
this
court's
basically
said
in
union
pacific
in
1957.
in
union
pacific,
the
court
said
look,
these
pre-1871
cases
use
the
term
"limited
fee",
but
really,
we're
not
going
to
deem
that
to
be
controlling
with
respect
to
the
mineral
rights.
and
the
court
is
doing
exactly
what
we're
saying
should
be
done
here,
which
is
you
understand
the
right-of-way
in
the
context
of
the
statutory
text,
in
the
context
of
the
environment,
the
surrounding
statutory
environment
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
it's
not
a
binary
black-or-white
choice
between,
you
know,
common
law
terms.
congress
didn't
use
those
common
law
terms.
congress
used
the
term
"right-of-way".
it
used
the
same
text
that
it
did
in
prior
grants
of
rights-of-way.
and
all
we're
trying
to
say
is
that
there
are
real
important
interests
here.
it's
not
practically
feasible
to
ever
reconstruct
these
arteries
through
the
lands.
and
they
were
important
when
congress
granted
them
to
develop
the
lands
in
1875,
and
they
remain
important
today,
as
congress
has
now
repeatedly
recognized
in
terms
of
granting
public
roads.
so--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--on
bike
trails,
this
is
--
this
is
not
a
rails-to-trails
act
case.
there
are
different
issues
there.
on
the
rails-to-trails
act
case,
you
know,
it's
--
i
don't
have
in
mileage,
but
this
is
a
trail
that
in
this
case
the
government
used
its
property
interest
through
the
national
forests
as
well
as
through
this
parcel
for
like
a
22-mile
trail.
there
are
probably
1,000
miles
of
trail
that
are
--
that
would
be
affected.
and
importantly,
there's
a
lot
of
interest
going
forward
that
would
be
affected.
when
the
law
again
--
the
law
of
--
in
1922
was
that
the
congress
would
reserve
the
united
states'
interests
for
roads
and
municipalities
and
that
was
a
significant--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--it
certainly
would
call
into
question
the
legality
of
the
land
transfers.
and
i'm
sure
that
could
be
something
that
could
be
litigated.
there
would
be
issues
--
i'm
sure
defenses
raised
by
the
states
and
municipalities.
but
what
the
court
would
be
saying
is
that
for
--
since
1922,
and
this
policy
continues
now,
that
the
highways
that
have
been
created
under
1875
act
would
be
invalid.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
yes.
it's
difficult
to
know,
because
again,
these
are
kind
of
ad
hoc
things.
when
there's
an
abandonment,
there
might
be
proceedings,
but
there's
been
--
we've
not
been
able
to
obtain
centralized,
reliable
information
on
the
total
number,
because
this
goes
back
a
pretty
long
way.
we're
talking
about,
again,
starting
in
1922,
you
know.
this
has
been
unchallenged
until
we
got
two
district
court
decisions
in
'80
--
in
the
mid
'80s
with
respect
to
the
surface.
now,
on
--
on
the
subsurface,
great
northern
has,
you
know,
continued
to
be
applied
by
interior
and
that's
been
treated
differently.
and
i
think
it's
important
also
to
remember
that
the
regulations,
not
only
were
they
cited
by
this
court
in
stalker
and
steinke,
the
court
was
clearly
aware
of
the
regulations.
in
1931,
the
--
a
case
called
otis
birch
where
interior
basically
followed
stalker
and
recognized
that
you
could
not
pass
title.
now,
that
was
a
mineral
act
case,
and
the
court
also
--
interior
also
said
that
because
you
can't
separate
the
estates,
or
there's
no
reason
to
separate
the
surface
from
the
subsurface,
the
mineral
couldn't
be
transferred,
either.
that's
been
overtaken
by
events.
it's
important
to
recognize
in
'31,
and
when
the
regs
were
codified
in
the
cfr
in
'38,
which
are
the
1909
regs,
which
had
never
been
changed
or
revisited
on
the
nature
of
the
interests,
they
simply
just
carried
forward,
even
though
interior
recognized
that
the
--
there
would
be
no
interest
given
to
patentees
of
the
land
after
a
right-of-way
is
granted
under
section
4
of
the
act.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
for
decades,
we
thought
we
owned
a
reversionary
interest.
it's
just
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
but
congress
told
us
--
told
everyone
how
to
dispose
of
it.
it
went
to
streets,
roads,
highways,
then
to
municipalities,
and
if
then
not
municipalities,
it
would
go
to
the
landowner.
so
the
united
states,
you
know,
disposed
of
its
reversionary
interests
through
statute.
it
wasn't
until
1988
that
the
policy
changed
to
--
to
prioritize
highways
and
then
the
u.s.'s
interests
after
that.
so
it's
understandable
why
we
haven't
been
intimately
involved
with
all
these
forfeitures
that
have
occurred
over
time.
congress
directed
how
the
united
states
interests
should
be
disposed
of.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
are
takings
claims
also
that
would
--
any
1875
act
case
or
right-of-way
which
has
been
abandoned,
which
has
then
put
to
another
use,
whether
it
be
a
highway
under
the
current
section
912,
or
whether
it
reverts
to
the
united
states,
or
even
if,
for
instance,
it
doesn't
revert
to
the
united
states--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
--
i
don't
believe
the
apa
would
govern
a
claim
of
damages
against
the
u.s.
there
are
takings
claims
which
--
which
proceed
under
the
tucker
act
against
the
u.s.
or
the
little
tucker
act,
depending
on
the
amount.
that
wouldn't
be
an
apa
issue.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
adverse
possession
is
certainly
an
issue
that
might
--
would
come
up.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
we've
faced--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
faced
a
very
considerable
amount
of
litigation
in
recent
years.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
for
local
roads?
this
is
--
the
idea
that
these
--
these
rights-of-ways
would
go
to
states
and
localities,
not
federal
highways.
that's
--
that's
section
912.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
are
some
records
that
you
can
get
from
archives
with
respect
to
specific
things,
but
it's
not
centralized.
we
don't
have
a
way
of
aggregating
what
has
happened
over
the
last
90
years.
that's
the
difficulty
that
we
have
here.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
thank
you.
