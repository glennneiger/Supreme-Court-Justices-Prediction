chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-1173,
marvin
brandt
revocable
trust
v.
united
states.
mr.
lechner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
patent
you
talk
about,
i
am
not
recalling
it
exactly.
it
had
some
--
it
mentioned
the
railroad
interest,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
didn't
characterize
it
as
either
an
easement
or
a
fee
with
an
implied
reverter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
are
not
really
not
alternative
--
well,
maybe
it's
all
right
to
say
they
are
alternative
arguments,
but
they
are
mutually
exclusive
arguments.
i
mean
they
are
alternative
in
the
sense
that
they
led
to
the
same
result,
but
the
one
argument
is
that
this
is
a,
and
the
other
argument
is
this
is
not
a.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
then
did
no
one
from
the
department
of
interior
join
your
brief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
don't
have
a
choice,
do
they?
i
mean,
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--maybe
the
reason
you
don't
have
records
on
this,
which
strikes
me
as
pretty
unusual
that
the
government
doesn't
know
what
it
owns,
is
that
for
decades,
you
didn't
think
that
you
owned
a
reversionary
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
have
any
records
on
where
these
things
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
lechner,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
