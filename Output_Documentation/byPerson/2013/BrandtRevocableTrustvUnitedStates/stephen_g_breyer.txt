justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
are
saying,
i
think
the
government's
point
is
--
the
other
side
is
saying,
and
i
don't
remember
the
term
of
my
property
law.
what's
the
right
term?
it's
--
you
grant
to
a,
black
acre
to
a
and
his
heirs;
it's
a
fee
simple.
but
it's
subject
to
a
shifting;
it's
subject
to
divestiture,
subject
to
a
condition
subsequent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
shifts
the
--
it
shifts
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
be.
there
was
a
technical
term
they
used
to
have.
but
anyway,
that's
what
they're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
are
saying
that
that's,
for
purposes
of
who
owns
the
land,
the
mineral
rights,
it's
treated
as
an
easement.
but
for
purposes
of
deciding
who
it
reverts
to,
it's
treated
as
a
fee
subject
to
a
shifting
use
or
whatever
you
call
it.
subject
to
--
what
did
you
say?
subject
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
different
in
this
respect.
it's
different
that
there
they
were
talking
about
who
owns
the
mineral
rights.
so
for
those
purposes
they
say
it's
treated
like
an
easement.
but
for
who
gets
the
reverter,
it's
treated
like
a
shift
of
the
fee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
we
filed
a
brief
here
for
the
cities,
and
they
point
out
that
--
that,
of
course,
there
is
reliance
on
your
side;
you're
--
i
believe
you
are
absolutely
right.
but
they
say
there
is
also
a
lot
of
reliance
on
the
other
side,
because
cities
have
built
highways,
and
they've
--
or
states
have,
and
they've
converted
it
to
use
under
patents
or
under
statutes
that
the
united
states
gave
them
that
right.
and
all
those
are
going
to
be
invalid
if
you
win.
so
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
about
when
912
says
when
the
railroad
abandons
a
piece
of
the
right-of-way,
okay,
it
then
says
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
with
all
right,
title,
and
interest
in
the
state
of
the
united
states
shall
be
vested
in
the
town
that
builds
the
highway.
but
your
point
is,
that's
true,
but
where
they
previously
--
where
they
have
previous
--
where
they
have
given
--
where
they
conveyed
it
to
a
private
person,
they
didn't
have
any
right,
title,
and
interest,
because
on
abandonment
it
was
simply
an
easement.
and
on
abandonment,
that
goes
to
the
property
owner
who
owns
the
--
the
land
on
either
side.
is
that
--
i
mean,
your
point
is
that
the
united
states
didn't
have
any
right,
title,
and
interest
on
the
abandonment
unless
the
united
states
continued
to
own
the
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
that
is
your
point.
they
can't
convey
what
they
don't
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
got
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
are
the
numbers?
i
mean,
look,
this
is
what
i'm
thinking.
this
is
property
law.
it's
not
just
a
question
of
trying
to
work
out
what
the
case
could
or
couldn't
have
stood
for.
if
i
try
to
remember
my
property
class,
it
vaguely
was
--
which
was
a
great
class,
a.
james
casner,
real
expert.
and
he
--
he,
i
think,
said
that
when
you
convey
subject
to
divestment,
the
--
something
called
season
under
the
common
law
went
to
the
recipient
of
the
conveyance.
but
if
you
conveyed
an
easement,
season
did
not
pass.
so
in
holding
that
it
is
an
easement,
you're
holding
there
was
no
season,
and
therefore,
it
couldn't
be
a
divestiture.
now,
whether
that's
true
or
not
or
i've
misremembered
it,
i'd
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
is
there
a
single
example
since
the
doomsday
book,
since
dadonis,
since
the
bracton
on
little
to
whatever
it
was.
i
mean,
in
the
history
of
the
common
law
up
to
the
present
where
a
court
has
interpreted
an
ambiguous
phrase,
which
doesn't
say
to
grant
an
easement
for
one
purpose,
but
not
for
the
other.
there
may
be
some,
but
i
didn't
notice
any
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
said
in
any
case
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
what
is
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
case?
i'd
like
to
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
they
had
--
they
had
a
different
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
it
was
an
easement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
read
what
--
it
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
do
i
--
where
is
it
roughly
in
your
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
all
right.
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
surprised
that
--
but
the
--
if
you
think
there
are
some,
i'll
get
my
law
clerks
to
look--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
imagine
or
explain
to
me
why
a
property
lawyer
worth
his
salt
since
70
years
ago
or
more,
1942,
wouldn't
have
read
that
case
and
advised
his
client,
who
was
buying
the
land,
if
the
railroad
abandons
it,
it's
yours.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
some
evidence
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
reasons.
i
want
to
know
if
there's
any
authority,
and
then
you
can
give
me
the
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
see
that
they
do
and
i
certainly
think
bicycle
paths
are
a
good
idea,
but
the
problem
that
i
see
here
is
just
what
justice
kagan
is
bringing
up;
that
is,
as
i
read
this,
i
think
there
might
be
millions
of
acres
in
the
last
70
years
that
have
been
conveyed.
for
all
i
know,
there
is
some
right
of
way
that
goes
through
people's
houses,
you
know,
and
all
of
a
sudden,
they
are
going
to
be
living
in
their
house
and
suddenly
a
bicycle
will
run
through
it,
which
isn't
so
bad,
but
i'm
concerned
about
that,
and
your
answer
makes
me
more
concerned--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
you
haven't
suggested
anything
that
makes
me
think
there
aren't
millions
and
millions
of
acres
involved.
now,
what
are
you
going
to
say
that
disabuses
me
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
because
the
lawyer
would
think
--
when
he
reads
the
case
of
great
northern,
you
think
it's
an
easement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
much
is
that?
how
much
roughly
is
that?
how
often
has
it
turned
out
that
there
was
a
conveyance
--
after
1942
there
was
a
conveyance
of
an
abandoned
right
of
way
by
the
united
states
to
land
that
had
been
previously
been
granted
to
a
private
owner?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
often?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
don't
have
good
numbers,
but
can
you
give
me
a
rough
estimate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
will
say
ten
times
as
much
reliance
on
the
one
side
than
the
other
side,
is
that
totally
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
when
you
talk
about
--
i
mean,
i
went
and
read
--
when
i
read
--
i
thought
your
brief
was
very
persuasive
and
then
i
read
great
northern
and
i
thought
they
have
--
they
are
really
quoting
it
correctly.
here's
what
they
said
about
the
cases
that
you
refer
to
like
stringer,
the
conclusion
of
the
railroad
was
the
owner
of
a
limited
fee
--
which
was
the
conclusion
of
those
earlier
cases
--
was
based
on
cases
arising
out
of
the
1871
act,
not
the
1875
act,
and
the
change
of
policy
in
1875
was
brought
--
was
not
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
and
then
they
say
that
conclusion
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
1875
act.
it's
history.
and
it's
early
administrative
interpretation.
we
therefore
do
not
regard
this
earlier
case
as
controlling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
they
said
in
the
stringer
case.
is
that
same
as--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
that's
the
one
you
were--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
--
that's
basically
my
problem.
i
guess
you
just
don't
have
any
specific
things
of
what
property
lawyers
were
saying.
but
those
two
cases
are
from
the
era
of
stringer,
and
at
that
point,
apparently,
the
court
thought
it
was
a
limited
fee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you
get
--
they
were
all
--
was
any
of
them
after
great
northern?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
then
in
great
northern
it
comes
along?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
think
of
anything
i
can
do
about
this?
it's
a
case,
in
my
mind
at
least,
where
reliance
interests
on
--
on
a
previous
case
in
the
property
law
area
are
important,
and
yet
none
of
the
briefs
here
really
gives
me
a
--
a
reasonably
concrete
idea
of
how
much
reliance
there
has
been.
and
--
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i'm
somewhat
in
the
dark.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
interior
or
some
--
i
mean,
doesn't
the
highway
--
aren't
there
people
in
the
government
who
keep
track
of
where
the
highways
are
built?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
would
be
the
private
parties
that
would
have
brought
it
up
in
great
northern,
wouldn't
it?
and
do
you
have
any
light
to
shed
on
the
comparative
amounts?
i
mean,
they're
saying
--
for
all
we
know
there
are
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
takings
claims
that
will
come
out
where
the
highways
run,
and
you're
arguing,
of
course,
any
reasonable
property
lawyer
would
have
relied
on
great
northern
to
think
it
was
just
conveying
an
easement.
but,
you
know,
i'm
not
a
property
lawyer,
and
so
what
actually
happened
matters.
and
the
amounts
matter,
at
least
to
me.
and
do
you
have
any
light
to
shed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
on
your
side?
what
about
the
possibility
that
millions
of
acres
has
been
conveyed
and
there
are
tens
of
thousands
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
abandoned
railroads
that
property
lawyers
thought
went
to
the
person
who
bought
them,
and
run
through
somebody's
house?
i
mean,
is
that
a
figment
of
my
imagination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
would
say
no,
it
isn't,
and
therefore
i'm
asking
you
is
there
any
empirical
support
anywhere
for
how
property
lawyers
have
treated
great
northern,
how
much
was
conveyed,
et
cetera?
anything
you
can
say
on
that
would
be
helpful.
