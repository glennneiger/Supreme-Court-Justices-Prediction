mr.
steven
j
lechner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
upheld,
the
decision
below
will
upset
100
years
of
property
law
and
title
to
perhaps
a
million
acres
of
land,
based
upon
an
implied
reversionary
interest
that
the
government
recently
created.
i
would
like
to
make
three
points:
first,
the
decision
below
violates
leo
sheep,
where
this
court
rejected
the
government's
attempt
to
create
a
property
interest
through
implication
and
reaffirmed
that
the
government
does
not
retain
any
interest
not
expressly
reserved
in
the
patent
or
the
granting
statute.
two,
the
decision
below
is
contrary
to
both
the
government's
argument
and
this
court's
ruling
in
great
northern
that
1875
act
rights-of-way
are
easements
and
are
not
fees.
and
finally,
the
decision
below
is
inconsistent
with
the
department
of
interior's
longstanding
interpretation
that
the
1875
act
granted
only
an
easement.
it
is
axiomatic
that
the
highest
evidence
of
title
in
this
country
is
a
patent
from
the
government.
when
the
government
issues
a
patent,
it
divests
itself
of
title
except
for
those
interests
expressly
reserved.
here,
the
patent
did
not
reserve
any
interest
in
the
1875
act--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--here
the
patent
did
not
reserve
any
interest
in
1875
act
right-of-way.
yet
the
government
knew
how
to
reserve
interests
at
that
time
because
it
reserved
the
interest
for
ditches
and
canal,
and
reserved
the
right
to
two
forest
service
roads
when
it
issued
the
patent.
that
some
interests
were
reserved
by
the
government
in
1976
shows
that
other
interests
were
not.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
no.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
1912,
section
1912
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
this
court's
decision
in
northern
pacific
v.
townsend,
and
stringham.
and
in
those
decisions,
this
court
held
that
railroad
rights-of-way
were
limited
fees
with
implied
reversionary
interests.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
yes,
it
mentioned
it
in
the
context
of,
that
brandt's
title
is
subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes
as
had
been
granted
to
the
railroad
under
the
1875
act.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
that
it
was
subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes
as
had
been
granted
to
the
railroad
sounds
like
it
was
granted
subject
to
a
servitude.
"rights
for
railroad
purpose"
sounds
like
a
servitude.
and
of
course
that's
how
the
department
of
interior
interpreted
it
at
the
time,
that
these
1875
rights-of-way
were
easements,
following
its
longstanding
interpretation
plus
this
court's
ruling
in
great
northern
that
these
were
easements.
and
at
the
time,
that
regulation
was
the
law
of
the
land.
and
that's
--
that
controlled
the
title
that
brandt
got.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--a
defeasible
fee?
or
implied
conditional--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
subject
to
a
right
of
reverter.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
yes.
but
that's
similar
to
the
argument
that
the
government
made
in
1942
in
great
northern.
the
limited
fee--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--exactly.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
correct.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
seventy-two
years.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
no,
but
i
think
it's
important
that
--
the
argument
that
the
government
is
making
today
is
similar
to
their
alternative
argument
that
they
made
there
in
great
northern,
saying,
okay,
well,
if
it's
not
an
easement,
then
it's
a
limited
fee
in
a
surface.
this
court
in
great
northern
did
not
even
address
that
alternative
argument,
which
shows
how
strongly
this
court
in
great
northern
believed
it
was
just
an
easement.
and
this--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--yes.
they
are
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
they
would
all
--
i'm
not
sure
that
they
would
be
invalid,
necessarily.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
where
all
the
city
public
highways'
interests
are,
vis-a-vis
how
the
land
was
originally
patented.
it
could
have
been
originally
patented
in
a
town
site
plat
or
something
like
that,
that
--
as
opposed
to
here,
where
it
was
originally
patented
to
one
--
under
one
patent,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
all
the
cities'
property
was
acquired.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
absolutely,
plus
the
cities
also
have
the
--
the
power
of
the
eminent
--
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
and
if
they
would
want
a
public
highway,
they
certainly
could
condemn
one.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
that's
what
--
that's
what
they
--
that's
what
the
cities
were
relying
on.
but
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
section
912
did
not
alter
or
amend
the
1875
act,
so
the
nature
of
the
grant
in
the
1875
act
must
be
looked
through
the
eyes
of
congress
in
1875.
in
1922,
when
congress
passed
section
912,
congress
was
grappling
with
what
to
do
with
these
isolated
strips
of
land
that
would
be
administratively
burdensome
to
manage.
and
they
said
--
well,
originally,
they
said,
well,
let's
give
them
to
the
settlers
because
they
are
the
ones
entitled
to
it
in
the
first
place,
and
then
--
and
then
as
an
afterthought
said,
well,
let's
put
these
as
a
public
highway.
but
they
did
not
amend
the
grant
under
the
1875
act
or
alter
the
amended
grant.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
correct.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
as
the
government
argued
in
great
northern
and
as
this
court
adopted
that
argument,
the
key
provision
in
the
1875
act
is
section
4,
which
reserved
the
right
to
congress
to
dispose
of
the
lands
underlying
1875
rights-of-way
to
settlers.
and
this
was
a
reflection
of
the
change
of
policy
in
1871
because
that's
where
the
congress
changed
its
policy
to
--
in
an
effort
to
secure
homesteads
to
actual
settlers
as
opposed
to
benefiting
the
railroads.
in
section
4,
as
this
court
said
in
great
northern,
after
language
to
demonstrate
a
conveyance
of
an
easement
would
be
hard
to
find.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
but
it's
--
it's
not
only
my
interpretation,
it's
the
interpretation
of
the
court
in
great
northern
that
it
was
an
easement.
and
this
court
was
not
--
this
court
in
great
northern
knew
the
difference
of
the
word
"easement"
and
knew
what
the
significance
of
using
that
term
would
mean.
so
did
the
government
at
the
time.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
the
station--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--well,
under
--
under
the
1875
act,
yes,
congress
did
provide
for
station
grounds.
the
railroad
could
secure
station
grounds
by
filing
a
map
of
the
station
grounds
with
the
local
land
office,
and
once
the
secretary
approved,
then
they
would
acquire
the
station
grounds.
but
the
nature
of
the
grant
that
they
required
on
the
station
grounds
is
the
same
as
for
the
right-of-way,
and
that's
merely
an
easement.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
yes.
and
that
was
how
the
department
of
interior
originally
interpreted
it
in
1888,
as
the
--
the
railroad
didn't
get
a
fee
in
anything,
it
got
a
right-of-way
--
it
got
an
easement
in
the
railroad
--
in
the
right-of-way
and
in
the
station
grounds.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
i
think
the
right
--
the
station
grounds
are
tied
to
the
right-of-way.
so
if
you
abandon
the
right-of-way,
the
station
grounds
would
also
be
extinguished
and
unburden
the
underlying
fee.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well
--
well,
first,
i
don't
--
912
did
not
change
the
grant
to
the
railroad.
912
applies
if
the
government
has
any
remaining
interest
in
the
right-of-way.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
correct.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
they
were
conveying
it
subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes
is
the
specific
language.
and
the
912
does
not
create
a
reservation;
it
doesn't
create
a
right
of
reverter.
it
was
simply
to
deal
with
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
these
strips
of
land
upon
abandonment.
because
at
the
time,
that's
when
abandonment
of
the
railroads
first
began,
congress
was
worried
we
were
going
to
have
these
isolated
strips.
it
didn't
change
the
1875
act,
it
didn't
change
the
previously
granted
rights-of-way
to
expand
the
scope
of
them.
but
when
they
were
abandoned
and
they
came
back
under
the
law
at
the
time
that
the
government
had
the
implied
condition
of
reverter,
they
came
back.
the
government
said,
okay,
well,
if
you
want
to
establish
a
public
highway,
that's
fine,
otherwise,
it's
going
to
go
--
it's
going
to
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
settler.
but
it
didn't
change
the
nature
of
the
grant.
it
didn't
change
the
1875
act.
it
didn't
create
it.
it
did
not
create
an
interest
that
wasn't
there
before.
it
was
just
how
to
deal
with
the
interest
that
the
--
that
congress
thought
it
had
after
this
court's
decision
in
townsend
and
stringham.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
i'm
--
i'm
--
one
--
well,
i'm
--
i'm
troubled.
under
--
under
your
hypothetical,
the
government
still
owns
the
underlying
land
where
the
railroad's
abandoned?
so
when
the
railroad
is
abandoned,
the
two
estates
merge.
there
was
one.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well,
i
think
that's
the
argument
under
--
under
the
common
law,
too,
is
--
is
what--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--so
they
--
they
merge.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
they
merge.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
correct.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
correct.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
and
there's--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--in
certain
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
it
was
subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes,
correct.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes,
that
conveys--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--exact
language
on
page
78,
petitioner's
appendix.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
petitioner's
appendix,
78,
sorry.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
78.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well,
there
was
a
question
about
whether
that
was
actually
the
language,
was
it
subject
to
those
rights.
the
last
full
paragraph,
"subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes
have
been
granted
to
the
railroad
under
the
1875
act.
"
mr.
steven
j
lechner
a
right
to
lay
their
tracks
and
a
right
of
passage.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well,
yes,
and
as
the
government
argued
in
great
northern
that
that
was
--
that
right
in
the
1875
act
was
a
right
to
lay
tracks
and
it
was
a
right
of
passage
and
easement.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
first,
the
shift
in
congress's
policy.
and
the
railroads
fell
out
of
disfavor
and
congress
passed
resolution
saying,
you
know,
we
want
to
hold
on
to
these
lands
to
secure
homesteads
for
actual
settlers.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well,
section
4
has
a
lot
to
do
with
that,
and
that
is
where
congress
reserved
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
underlying
lands
to
the
settlers.
that
provision
is
not
found
in
the
pre-1871
railroad
grants,
and
this
court
in
great
northern
looked
at
that
and
you
say,
you
got
to
look
at
section
4,
that
provides
light
on
how
to
interpret
the
right-of-way
grant
in
section
1.
and
because
of
congress's
intent
and
the
legislative
history
surrounding
similar
language
when
congress
passed
it
in
1872,
they
called
it
the
right-of-way
is
going
to
be
an
encumbrance.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
but
as
the
government
argued
in
great
northern,
it
would
be
silly
to
patent
the
underlying
lands
subject
to
a
fee.
i
mean,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
that
language
at
all
if
the
railroad
got
a
fee.
and
then
you
patented
the
--
in
effect
it
would
be
the
adjacent
land,
not
the
underlying
land.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
say
that
the
adjacent
land
is
subject
to
a
fee
because
with
the
limited
fees,
they
were
envisioning
those
things
going
to
the
center
of
the
earth.
so
you
would
be
patenting
the
adjacent
land.
but
under
section
4
and
as
great
northern
interpreted,
the
patents
go
to
the
underlying
land
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
because
brandt
owns
the
underlying
land
and
minerals.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
well,
i
was
using
limited
fee
in
the
context
as
this
court
used
it
in
townsend,
limited
fee
with
the
implied
condition
of
reverter.
i
mean,
even
in
townsend
1903,
the
railroad
got
it
all,
but
it
was
subject
to
implied
condition
of
reverter
if
they
stopped
using
it
for
railroad
purpose.
but
they
did
give
fee
simple
absolute
to
the
center
of
the
earth
is
how
it
was
construed
at
that
time.
so
that
sheds
light
on
the
fact
that
section
4
reflects
that
only
an
easement
was
granted
because
you
would
not
need
to
have
subject
2
language
at
all
if
you
were
just
patenting
the
adjacent
lands.
it
is
also
well
established
that
the
interpretation
of
the
land
laws
such
as
the
1875
act
is
entitled
to
great
deference.
this
is
because
public
land
laws
provide
for
the
acquisition
of
the
title,
which
must
be
secure.
beginning
from
1988
and
continuing
through
today,
the
department
of
interior
still
construes
the
1875
act
as
easements
and
they
can
still
construe
1875
act
rights
of
way
as
different
from
pre-1871.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
i'm
saying--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--well,
i
think,
under
this
court's
precedent,
you
defer
to
the
agency
in
charge
of
administering
the
1875
act,
and
that
is
the
department
of
interior.
and
the
department
of
interior
has
consistently
interpreted
these
as
--
these
rights
of
way
as
easements
and
that
interpretation
is
entitled
to
substantial
deference.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
we
do
know
how
many
acres
are
involved
in
this
case,
and
the
government
is
claiming
10
of
the
83
acres
that
it
patented
to
marvin
brandt's
parents.
as
this
court
has
noted,
stare
decisis
concerns
are
--
in
many
cases
involving
property
rights.
with
respect
to
stalker
and
steinke,
those
were
pre-great
northern;
those
were
limited
fee
cases.
at
most,
they
stand
for
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
steinke
was
written
by
justice
van
devanter
who
also
wrote
stringham,
which
great
northern
overturned.
and
that's
why
stalker
and
steinke
fell
out
of
use
over
the
years.
and
if
stalker
and
steinke
were
so
important,
the
government
should
have
brought
those
cases
to
the
court's
attention
in
great
northern,
but
it
didn't.
with
respect
to
the
1931
land
decision
the
government
just
brought
up,
i
--
i
refer
the
court
to
solicitor's
opinion--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--i
don't
have
any
light
to
shed
on
the
actual
mileage.
we
know
it's
thousands.
we
know
that--
mr.
steven
j
lechner
--no.
mr.
steven
j
lechner
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
the
quantity,
but
i
know
that
with
s.c.
--
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
in
s.c.
johnson
that
the
title
insurance
thought
that
was
a
landmark
decision
because
it
resolved
a
lot
of
problems
with
the
title
insurance
industry.
each
mile
of
the
right-of-way
takes
up

acres.
at
one
point
there
were
270,000,
as
this
court
noted
in
preseault,
there
was
270,000
miles
of
roads
at
the
peak
in
the
early
1920s
and
about
130
of
those
had
been
abandoned
by
the
time
of
the
preseault
decision.
i
want
to
also
address
the
forfeiture
provision
that
they
mention
and
great
northern
relied
on
section
43,
940,
to
confirm
its
conclusion
that
the
s
and
d,
these
are
easements
because
43
u.s.c.
940
calls
them
an
easement.
and
with
respect
to
land
that
the
government
still
owned
at
the
time
of
abandonment,
they
said
that
the
government's
land
would
be
discharged
of
the
easements.
