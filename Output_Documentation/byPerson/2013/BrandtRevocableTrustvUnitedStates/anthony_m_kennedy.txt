there
were
--
there
were
points
along
the
right-of-way
where
the
railroad
needed
a
station
or
a
wider
area
for
water
towers
and
so
forth.
and
it
--
it
usually
could
receive
those
by
simply
filing
a
patent
if
it
was
within
a
permitted
zone,
if
it
was
within
--
if
they
were
20
miles
equidistant
or
something
like
that.
how
did
they
get
those
additional
lands?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
way
they
could
do
them
was
to
condemn
them,
but
absent
condemnation,
could
they
just
receive
them
from
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh.
so
it's
--
so
it
was
clear
at
the
time
of
the
grant
that
it
was
on
the
--
that
what
was
granted
was
co-extensive
with
what
the
right-of-way
was,
with
the
railroad
right-of-way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
instances
in
which
the
railroad
can
keep
its
station
even
if
it
abandons
the
right-of-way?
or
does
the
station
fall
with
the
--
when
the
right-of-way
is
abandoned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
do
you
want
us
to
read
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
answer
it
seemed
to
me,
and
maybe
you
have
to
proffer,
that
you
confused
limited
fee
with
fee
simple
or
absolute
fee.
now,
obviously
that's
true
if
it's
the
same
owner,
they
merge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
doctrine
in
property
law
that
if
a
right
of
access
is
granted
and
its
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
uses,
it's
--
it
looks
for
all
purposes
like
absolute
control,
that
it
ceases
to
be
an
easement
and
becomes
a
limited
fee?
i
mean
is
there
some
magic
that
takes
place
in
property
law
so
that
if
there's
a
grant
that
conveys
such
total
control,
is
it
construed
not
to
be
an
easement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i've
never
seen
it.
