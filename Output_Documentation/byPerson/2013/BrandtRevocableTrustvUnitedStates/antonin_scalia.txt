justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
you
are
not
reading
this,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
nice.
do
you
know
of
any
other
real
estate
thing
which
says
it's
an
easement
for
one
purpose
and
the
fee
for
another?
the
government
absolutely
denied
in
great
northern,
didn't
it?
it
was
--
that
was
the
government's
case;
this
was
not
a
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
it's
a
--
you
know,
for
some
purposes
it
is.
they
said
it
was
not
a
fee.
and
that's
what
the
court
held,
contrary
--
in
accordance
with
what
the
government
wanted,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
case
has
been
around
for
how
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
the
case
explicitly
says
it's
an
easement.
and
people
have
been
buying
and
selling
real
estate
i
assume
in
reliance
on
that
case
for
--
for
that
entire
period
of
time.
and
now
the
government
has
this
new
theory
that
for
some
purposes
it's
a
fee;
for
some
purposes
it's
an
easement.
that's
not
what
great
northern
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
your
answer
would
be
that
if
it's
a
choice
between
disappointing
people
who
properly
relied
on
the
law,
and
disappointing
people
who
were
--
were
not
following
the
law,
it's
clear
who
should
--
who
should
take
it
in
the
neck.
it's
the
latter,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
that
can
be,
and
yet,
the
government
can
argue
contrary
to
what
the
government
says.
i
mean,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
interior
says
one
thing
and
the
justice
department
here
says
something
else?
i
mean,
we
have
a
president
who
reconciles
these
two
things.
he
must
agree
with
one
or
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
the
government
will
have
an
explanation
as
to
why
we
shouldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait.
before
you
go,
you
really
think
the
court
was
saying,
it
will
be
an
easement
when
that
suits
the
government,
but
it
will
be
something
else
when
that
suits
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
either
an
easement
or
it's
not
an
easement.
you
really
think
the
--
the
opinion
meant
to
reserve
the
question
whether
it
was
an
easement.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
give
compensation
to
the
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
whom
they
pronounced
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
change
the
meaning
of
the
1875
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
reflects
a
later
congress's
understanding
of
what
an
earlier
congress
did.
we
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--interpret
statutes
on
the
basis
of
what
later
congresses
think
they
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
people
have
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
both
of
them
want
more
federal
lands,
that's
surprising,
right,
both
agriculture
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
adverse
possession?
can't
the
--
can't
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
think
if
there's
been
no
objection
to
these
spaghetti
strips
of
land,
i
don't
think
condemnation
would
cost
the
government
a
whole
lot
for
that
matter.
what,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
a
spaghetti
strip
of
land
through--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
you
should
--
should
know
how
much
land
the
united
states
owns.
it's
--
it's
incredible
that
--
that
there's
no
record
in
the
interior
department
or
anywhere
else
of
what
land
the
united
states
own.
you
claim
you
own
these
thousands
of
acres,
and
you
say
we've
not
kept
track
of
it.
we
just
know
where
it's
going
to
go,
but
we
don't
know
what
we
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
even
heard
of
the
term
"limited
fee"
until
this
case?
i
never
heard
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
james
casner
didn't
talk
to
me
about
limited
fee.
