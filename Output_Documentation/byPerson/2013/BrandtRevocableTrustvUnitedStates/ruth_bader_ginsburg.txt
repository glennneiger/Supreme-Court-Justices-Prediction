justice
ruth

i
thought
this
--
the
cities
were
relying
on
section
912,
as
applied
to
this
1875
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
explain
to
me
something
to
me
about
that
1875
act
a
little
bit?
we
know
that
until
1871,
these
railroad
rights-of-way
were
considered
to
leave
the
government
in
the
position
of
having
a
reversionary
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
1875
act
statute.
there
was
an
end
to
the
giving
away
of
large
--
large
quantities
of
land
to
the
railroad,
and
so
that
went
out.
but
what
is
there
in
the
1875
act
that
changes
the
right-of-way
from
what
it
had
been
up
until
1871?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
railroad
wasn't
benefited
by
the
end
of
the
1871
understanding
of
the
right-of-way.
the
one
that
was
benefited
was
the
government.
the
government
got
--
got
back
the
land,
so
it's
not
--
we're
not
--
was
going
to
stop
giving
land
to
the
railroad,
yes,
but
the
beneficiary
that
is
losing
out
under
your
interpretation
is
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yang,
would
you
clarify
what
you're
--
what
mr.
lechner
told
us.
he
said
that
to
this
very
day
the
department
of
interior
has
taken
the
position
that
these
railroad
rights
of
way
are
easements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
--
what
would
be
the
exposure
of
the
united
states
if
we
--
if
you
--
are
there
takings
claims
now?
