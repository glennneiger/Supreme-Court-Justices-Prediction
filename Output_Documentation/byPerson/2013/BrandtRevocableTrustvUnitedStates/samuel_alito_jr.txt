justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
under
section
1912,
the
government
could
--
did
reserve
an
interest
for
a
public
highway;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
again
about
section
912?
your
patent
says
that
it
is
subject
to
those
rights
for
railroad
purposes
as
have
been
granted
to
the
railway
company
in
particular,
and
its
successors
and
assigns.
now,
that
was
--
that
patent
came
after
the
enactment
of
912,
and
912
clarifies
the
rights
of
--
or
changes
the
rights
of
railroad
companies
and
says
that
if
they
abandon
property,
within
one
year
after
that,
they
--
there
can
be
a
public
highway
established
on
that
--
on
that
property.
so
why
wasn't
your
patent
subject
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
didn't
get
your
property
from
the
railroad.
you
got
it
from
the
government.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
got
a
patent
from
the
government.
so
the
question
is:
what
were
they
conveying
to
you?
and
if
you
read
the
patent
in
connection
with
912,
isn't
it
clear
they're
conveying
to
you
every
--
arguably
everything
other
than
this
right
to
have
a
public
highway
established
on
that
land
when
it
was
abandoned
by
the
railroad?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
it.
you
say
this
was
purely
an
easement.
all
right.
so
that
means
that
when
there's
an
abandonment,
the
government
has
complete
title
to
the
property,
right?
they
convey
that
property
to
you,
but
before
they
do
that,
they
say
that
there's
this
reservation
of
rights
with
respect
to
the
establishment
of
a
highway.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yeah.
okay.
and
may
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
may
be
a
good
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
your
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
yang,
i
have
to
say
i
think
the
government
gets
the
prize
for
understatement
with
its
brief
in
this
case.
you
have
a
sentence
in
your
brief
that
says,
"we
acknowledge
that
there
is
language
in
this
court's
opinion
in
great
northern
and
in
the
government's
brief
in
that
case
that
lends
some
support
to
petitioner's
contrary
argument.
"
here
are
the
subject
headings
of
the
government's
brief
in
great
northern.
"the
right-of-way
granted
by
the
act
of
march
3,
1875,
is
in
the
nature
of
an
easement.
"
"the
language
of
the
1875
act
shows
that
only
an
easement
was
granted.
"
"the
legislative
background
and
history
of
the
1875
act
show
that
the
grant
was
of
an
easement
rather
than
a
fee.
"
"subsequent
administrative
and
congressional
construction
confirm
that
only
an
easement
was
granted.
"
under
the
first
sentence
of
the
summary
of
the
argument--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
may
be.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
term
"easement"
is
a
well-known
term
with
an
established
meaning.
and
you're
saying
that
--
you
said
it
was
an
easement.
the
court
said
it
was
an
easement.
you
--
you
persuaded
the
court
to
say
it
was
an
easement.
and
now
you're
saying
this
is
some
kind
of
property
right
that
has
no
name,
previously
unknown
to
the
law.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
we
know
how
many
miles
of
public
roads
and
how
many
miles
of
bike
trails
have
been
--
you
don't
know
that
either?
