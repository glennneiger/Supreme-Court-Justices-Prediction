mr.
lechner,
i
know
a
great
more
than
--
and
that
is
very
strong
support
for
your
view.
but
why
did
great
northern
think
that
there
was
a
difference
between
pre-1871
grants
and
post?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
had
thought
if
you
were
just
dealing
with
this
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
that
the
shift
of
congress's
policy
was
a
shift
about
whether
to
give
away,
you
know,
huge
swaths
of
land
to
the
railroads,
and
that
congress
indeed
decided,
enough
of
this,
we
are
not
going
to
give
these
checkerboard
grants
of
land
to
the
railroad,
because
they
are
making
a
mint
from
this,
and
we
would
rather
give
it
to
homesteaders.
but
there
was
--
i
don't
see
any
evidence
that
there
was
any
shift
in
policy
or
any
reason
why
there
would
be
a
shift
in
policy,
as
to
what
the
rights
of
way
were.
whether
they
were
easements
or
whether
they
were
limited
fees.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess,
you
know,
again,
if
you
were
just
looking
at
this
as
a
matter
of
first
impression,
the
language
of
section
4
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
very
indicative
of
anything.
you
know,
it
says
"subject
to
the
right-of-way".
subject
to
the
right-of-way.
whatever
the
right-of-way
is.
subject
to
the
right-of-way
if
it's
an
easement.
subject
to
the
right-of-way
if
it's
a
limited
fee.
doesn't
seem
to
pick
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
yang,
the
petitioners
say
that
there
are
thousands
or
even
tens
of
thousands
of
people
in
their
position.
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
yang,
could
i
take
you
back
to
my
question?
justice
elena
kagan
thousands,
tens
of
thousands?
how
many
people
are
involved
here
and
how
many
acres
of
land?
justice
elena
kagan
the
patent
here,
mr.
yang,
which
was,
what,
in
the
mid-1970s
did
not
reserve
anything.
the
government
just
made
an
uncritical
grant
to
the
grant
family?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
after
great
northern
and
then
you're
given
this
patent,
which
is
unequivocal
and
does
not
reserve
anything,
why
anybody
would
think
that
they
haven't
gotten
the
whole
ball
of
wax
is
a
mystery.
justice
elena
kagan
it
seems
to
me
a
fair
reading
of
the
history
here,
mr.
yang,
is
that
it
really
didn't
occur
to
the
government
until
very
recently
that
these
rights
of
way
had
value
as
anything
other
than
railroad
tracks,
and
indeed
that
the
government
was
anxiously
trying
to
give
these
things
away
because
it
thought
that
these
spaghetti
strips
of
land,
it's
of
no
use
to
the
government,
here,
take
them,
get
them
off
our
hands.
and
having
done
that
for
many,
many,
many
decades,
the
government
faces
a
problem
when
it
turns
around
and
says,
you
know
what,
we
forgot,
there
are
bike
paths.
justice
elena
kagan
are
there
highways
that
would
be
affected?
i
mean,
if
we
rule
for
the
brandts,
are
there
suddenly
going
to
be
highways
that
can
no
longer
be
highways
anymore?
