chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-1493,
abramski
v.
united
states.
mr.
dietz?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
--
in
the
situation
that
justice
alito
hypothesized
of
the
person
who's
doing
this
several
times
a
month
and
has
the
ad
in
the
yellow
pages,
is
that
--
is
that
person
subject
to
regulation
as
a
dealer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
palmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
in
this
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
in
the
act
does
--
is
the
basis
for
the
requirement
on
the
form?
the
form
says,
you
know,
if
you're
not
the
actual,
you're
buying
for
somebody
else.
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
(a)(6)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
very
--
it's
very
problematic
to
talk
about
the
overriding
purpose
when
you're
dealing
with
a
very
sensitive
compromise.
there's,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
talks
about
straw
men
or
actual
buyers
or
anything
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
a
strong
lobby
in
congress
saying
we're
the
group
that
supports
ponzi
schemes,
so
maybe
it
makes
more
sense
to
have
a
broad
construction
of
that
provision.
this
language
is
fought
over
tooth
and
nail
by
people
on
the,
you
know,
gun
control
side
and
the
gun
ownership
side.
and
to
say
--
you
look
at
it
and
say
well,
the
purpose
is
this,
even
though
there's
no
words
in
the
statute
that
have
anything
to
do
with
straw
purchasers,
i
think,
is
very
problematic.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
agree
that
in
justice
alito's
example,
that
person
is
regulated
as
a
gun
dealer,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
yellow
pages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
putting
an
ad--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--now,
this
--
this
--
now
you're
talking
about
the
second
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
provision
that
makes
the
--
the
information
that's
required,
makes
it
material
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
is
922(b)(5),
right?
that's
what
requires--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
now,
all
that
says
is
you
have
to
keep
the
information
of
the
person
to
whom
you're
transferring
the
firearm.
so
your
argument
has
to
be,
when
somebody
sees
the
person,
they
realize
that
that
means
not
somebody
who's
buying
it
for
somebody
else,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i
know.
if
i
assume
--
if
i
assume
you're
right,
then
you're
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
then
922(b)(5)
says,
but
the
fact
that
it's
--
has
to
be
the
actual
person
who
ends
up
with
the
gun.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
922--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
--
where
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he's
not
told
that
in
the
statute.
he's
told
that
in
a
form
that
was
quite
different
from
the
form
that
was
used
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dietz,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
