but
this
--
this
family
member,
the
uncle,
residing
in
pennsylvania,
he
could
not
have
purchased
that
gun
in
virginia,
isn't
that
right,
because
he's
a
nonresident?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
he
--
wouldn't
he
have
to
comply
with
the
552(c),
which
says
how
somebody
who
doesn't
show
up
in
person
can
purchase
a
gun?
and
none
of
those
requirements
were
satisfied
here.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
asking
is
just
an
end
run
around
what
congress
said.
if
you're
out
of
state
and
you
want
to
buy
it,
this
is
how
you
have
to
do
it.

mr.
palmore,
when
the
agency
changed
its
view
in
1994,
there
was
no
change
in
the
statutory
text,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
at
that
time,
the
interpretation
was
that
you
committed
the
offense
if
you
sold
--
if
the
person,
the
true
buyer,
was
an
unlawful
--
a
person
to
whom
firearms
could
not
be
sold.
but
if
you
--
if
the
ultimate
possessor
was
a
lawful
possessor,
then
there
was
no
liability.
so
the
--
the
statute
has
to
be
open,
at
least,
to
either
interpretation,
no
change
in
the
words.
the
agency
read
it
one
way,
and
then
later
changed
its
mind
and
read
it
the
other
way.
