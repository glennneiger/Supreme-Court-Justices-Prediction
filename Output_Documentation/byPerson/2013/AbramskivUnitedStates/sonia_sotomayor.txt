what
would
happen
if
two
people
walk
into
the
gun
store,
one
person
hands
the
money
to
the
other
and
says,
buy
me
that
gun?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
not
actionable,
according
to
your
theory?

what's
--
what's
truthful
about
saying
you're
the
buyer--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
--
what
position
are
you
taking
here?
are
you
arguing
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
straw
purchaser
or
not;
a
buyer
is
a
buyer
is
a
buyer?
it's
the
person
who
puts
the
money
down
on
the
counter?
or
are
you
arguing,
as
a
--
as
a
backup
or
as
your
main
point
--
i
don't
understand
--
that
if
it's
a
lawful
buyer
using
a
straw
man,
that
that's
not
actionable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
their
intent
is
to
sell
it
to
a
prohibited
person?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
that
crime
bosses--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
don't
think
crime
bosses
look
at
their
underlings,
pay
them
a
lot
of
money
for
whatever
they're
doing
and
just
say,
go
get
me
a
gun
and
give
it
to
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
answer
justice
kennedy's
question?
is
--
is
this
all
contingent
on
the
intent
at
the
moment?
i
mean,
you
had
a
lovely
wrapped
case
here
because
you
had
the
money
transferred
before
the
purchaser,
so
there's
no
question
that
the
intent
was
to
purchase
for
the
uncle.
but
what
about
the
situation
where
there's
a
conversation
beforehand
that
says,
i'm
going
to
buy
the
gun
and
i'll
sell
it
to
you
afterwards?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
i
gave
you
a
hypothetical.
what
--
what
--
why
is
it
a
factual--
