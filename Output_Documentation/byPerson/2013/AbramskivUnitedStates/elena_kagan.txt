justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
so
you're
saying
that
in
that
case,
the
gun
dealer
runs
the
background
check
on
the
person
who
hands
the
gun
dealer
the
credit
card
as
opposed
to
the
person
who
will
be
the
actual
recipient
of
the
gun?
is
that
what
you're
saying
the
statute
requires?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dietz,
can
we
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
alito
raised.
the
primary
object
of
this
statute
is
to
keep
guns
out
of
hands
of
felons,
of
people
with
mental
illness
and
so
forth.
now,
it's
absolutely
true,
as
you
have
said,
that
congress
didn't
do
everything
it
could
have
to
achieve
that
result,
right?
that
there
are
many
kinds
of
resales
that
are
allowable,
that
there
are
gifts
that
are
allowable.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
at
the
initial
point
of
sale,
which
is
where
the
entire
system
is
set
up,
right,
with
the
gun
dealer
doing
the
automatic
checks,
that
at
that
initial
point
of
sale,
which
is
the
centerpiece
of
this
statute,
that
we
will
--
that
we
will
essentially
disregard
fronts,
that
we
--
you
know,
that
we
don't
care
that
the
person
standing
at
the
counter
is
a
front.
i
mean,
that
goes
far
beyond
the
other
kinds
of
resale
possibilities
that
you're
talking
about.
and
i
guess
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
you
think
a
congress
that
was
geared
towards
this
object
of
keeping
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
and
set
up
a
mechanism
that
had
the
gun
seller
be
the
kind
of
enforcer,
at
the
point
of
sale,
would
have
thought,
oh,
it's
fine
if
a
front,
if
a
straw
walks
in
the
door.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
palmore,
is
that
right?
i
thought
that
mr.
dietz's
argument
went
beyond
what
justice
scalia
just
said,
that
for
mr.
dietz,
regarding
--
you
can
--
he
might
be
prosecuted
under
another
statute
for
selling
something
to
somebody
he
knows
is
al
capone,
but
that
he
was
--
you
know,
because
he
was
the
guy
at
the
counter
and
he
was
buying
for
somebody
else,
as
to
this
question
of
material
representation,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
ultimate
transferee
was
al
capone
or
somebody
else.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
he
said
that
just
right
in
here.
justice
elena
kagan
if
you're
right
on
question
1,
922(t)
just
makes
this
a
slam
dunk
on
question
2.
and
there's
a
question
about
whether
you
are
right
on
question
1.
but
if
you
are,
(t)
says,
look,
the
dealer
is
supposed
to
check
the
transferee,
right?
and
if
we
assume
that
when
congress
says
"the
transferee",
it's
the
real
transferee,
not
the
fake
transferee,
the
dealer
is
supposed
to
check
the
real
transferee.
so
what
does
the
dealer
think
is
material?
i
mean,
the
question
is:
what
does
a
reasonable
dealer
think
is
material?
i
better
know
who
you
are
so
i
can
check
you.
that's
material.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
not
just
the
structure
--
it's
not
just
the
overriding
purpose.
922(t)
says
that
the
dealer
is
supposed
to
check
the
transferee
to
find
out
whether
the
transferee
has
a
criminal
record,
to
find
out
whether
the
transferee
has
mental
illness.
so
who
does
he
check?
who
is
the
transferee?
well,
i
need
to
know
who
the
transferee
is
to
make
that
check.
so,
obviously,
it's
material
to
know
who
the
transferee
is.
