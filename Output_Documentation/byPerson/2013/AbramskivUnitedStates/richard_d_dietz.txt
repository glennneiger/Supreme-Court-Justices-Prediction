mr.
richard
d
dietz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
2009,
bruce
abramski
went
to
a
gun
store
at
his
home
in
virginia
and
purchased
a
firearm.
when
he
did
so,
he
filled
out
all
the
required
federal
paperwork
providing
his
own
name
and
identifying
information
and
passing
a
background
check.
he
then
traveled
to
his
uncle's
home
in
pennsylvania
and
delivered
the
firearm
to
a
licensed
gun
dealer
there.
that
gun
dealer
required
mr.
abramski's
uncle
to
fill
out
the
exact
same
federal
paperwork
and
pass
his
own
background
check
before
taking
possession
of
the
firearm.
but
despite
doing
precisely
what
congress
established
as
the
process
to
buy
a
firearm,
intending
to
sell
or
give
it
to
a
lawful
gun
owner
in
another
state,
the
government
charged
mr.
abramski
with
falsely
stating
that
he
was
the
actual
buyer
of
the
firearm
when
he
acquired
it.
and
that
term
"actual"--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
your
honor,
the
circumstance
where
there
are
two
lawful
gun
owners,
that
is
permissible.
and
i
think
a
good
way
to
illustrate
that
is
to
consider
the
government's
concession
that
in
that
hypothetical,
if
the
two
people
walked
into
the
gun
store
and
the
person
looked
and
said,
i'd
like
that
gun
and
points
to
the
counter
and
then
the
person
standing--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--yes,
your
honor.
in
that
circumstance,
if
the
person
standing
at
the
counter
then
says,
i'd
like
to
buy
that
firearm,
that
the
person
indicated,
i'm
going
to
give
it
to
that
person,
then
even
the
government
concedes
that
in
that
circumstance,
everything
about
that
sale
is
perfectly
lawful
and
the
buyer
can
take
the
gun,
hand
it
to
that
person
standing
next
to
them,
who
would
leave
the
gun
store
with
the
gun
dealer
and
the
government
having
absolutely
no
idea
who
that
person
is
or
where
the
gun
is
going.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
as
well
in
gift
circumstance
at
least,
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
gun
control
act
that
suggests
that
congress
was
distinguishing
between
those
two
circumstances
at
all.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
this
legislation,
the
way
congress
designed
it,
is
not
focused
on
sort
of
the
end
point.
it's
not
concerned
about
where
a
gun
is
actually
going.
who's
ultimately
going
to
receive
it.
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
starting
point,
because
as
part
of
the
key
political
compromise
of
the
gun
control
act,
there
were
two
competing
interests
that
needed
to
be
accommodated.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
your
honor,
i
think,
to
your
first
point
about
why,
why
starting
points,
the
reason
is
because
all
that
congress
wanted
is
to
provide
law
enforcement
with
a
way
to
trace
the
firearm.
if
you
have
truthful,
accurate
information
about
the
first
initial
purchaser,
the
person
who
walks
out
of
a
gun
store
with
a
gun
in
their
hand,
then
law
enforcement
has
that
starting
point
if
they
need
to
trace
the
firearm.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
your
honor,
that
would
--
that
would
violate
other
laws
because
congress
in
the
firearm
owners
protection
act
clarified
that
--
or
amended
the
provision
to
provide
that
a
private
citizen
who
transfers
a
firearm
to
someone
they
know
or
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
is
prohibited,
that's
a
crime.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
government
has
conceded
that
if
it's
someone
in
your
own
state,
there's--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
cases
like
mr.
abramski's
case,
where
his
uncle
lived
in
another
state,
congress
provided
a
path
for
those
people
as
well
and
that
is
they
have
to
deliver
the
firearm
to
another
dealer
in
that
state
before
finishing
the
transfer.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
sir.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
that's
because
that
--
that
was
the
key
compromise--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
principle
you
described
of
a
straw
man
or
straw
purchases
in
the
context,
historical
context
you
described
it,
i
don't
believe
is
a
criminal
context.
we've
not
been
able
to
find
any
case
in
which
the
criminal
law
has
ever
recognized
that
sort
of
civil
agency
law
principle,
that
when
there
is
a
principal-agent
relationship,
this
fiduciary
duty,
that
because
the
principal
controls
the
agent
or
the
straw
man,
that
everything
that
the
agent
does
is
really
an
act
of
the
principal.
and
congress
--
there
were
historically
criminal
common
law
principles
of
agency.
congress
codified
those
principles
in
title
18
united
states
code
section
2.
those
are
things
like
aiding
and
abetting,
principals
and
accessories.
that's
not
the
principle
on
which
the
government
relies
today.
the
government--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
and
i
think
the
reason
is
again
that
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
gun
control
act
was
not
to
trace
or
track
where
firearms
were
going.
so
in
every
case,
because
private
sales
have
no
recordkeeping
or
background
check
requirements,
in
every
case
where
there's
a
trace
of
a
firearm
the
government
has
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning.
they
go
to
the
manufacturer
with
the
serial
number
and
follow
the
gun
through
the
stream
of
commerce
until
find
that
gun
dealer
where
the
gun
was
first
sold,
and
then
they--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--but,
your
honor,
again
congress
understood
that
that's
how
the
statute
worked
because,
for
example--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is,
consider
for
example
a
circumstance
where,
instead
of
buying
firearm
with
intent
to
resell
it,
five
minutes
after
the
purchase,
walking
out
of
the
gun
store,
a
stranger
approaches
you
and
says:
that's
a
nice
looking
gun,
i'd
like
to
buy
it
from
you.
it's
perfectly
legal
under
the
gun
control
act
to
sell
the
gun
to
that
stranger,
who
then
will
leave
and
again
in
the
tracing
process,
the
government's
trace
will
stop
with
that
first
purchaser.
and
congress
understood
that
that's
how
the
process
would
work
and
that
was
part
of
the
compromise.
what
congress
wanted
was
accurate
information
about
the
initial
person
who
acquires
the
firearm
so
at
least
they
can
try
to
do
that
trace.
and
congress
understood
that
in
many
circumstances--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--yes,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
government
received
all
the
recordkeeping
and
background
check
information
that
they
could
possibly
have
received.
they
got
full
federal
paperwork
from
both
mr.
abramski
and
his
uncle
and
ran
a
background
check
on
both.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
the
reason,
your
honor
--
i
think
this
is
a
critical
concession
by
the
government.
it's
on
pages
35
and
36
of
their
brief.
the
government
acknowledges
that
the
statements
on
the
form
are
just
an
interpretive
rule
and
not
even
sort
of
ordinary
interpretive
rule
that
this
court
may
encounter
with
agency
interpretations
where
they
are
looking
at
the
statute,
and
although
they
have
not
been
delegated
with
authority
to
rule
make,
they
are
interpreting
the
text
of
the
statute.
here
the
government
acknowledges
that
the
statement
is
an
interpretation
of
the
case
law
about
the
straw
purchaser
doctrine.
and
the
problem
with
that
is
that
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits
about
what
that
case
precedent
should
be,
and
the
government's
suggesting
that
this
court
should
somehow
defer
to
the
statement
on
the
form
that
it
has
the
power
of
law,
that
people
should
acknowledge
it.
but,
of
course,
when
you
have
a
case
law
question
like
this
where
there's
a
split,
this
court
is
the
authority
that
decides
what
the
law
should
be.
and
it's
not
required
to
defer
at
all
to
the
statements
on
the
form.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
because
congress
understood
that
private
sales
--
that
there
was
an
importance
to
private
sales
between
citizens.
and
in
a
straw
purchase
like
this
or
--
or
someone
who's
purchasing
a
gun
intending
to
resell
it
to
someone
else,
that
is
precisely
what's
happening
is
that
second
sale
is
a
private
transaction
between
two
private
citizens
and
congress
did
not
want
any
regulation
of
those
types
of
sales.
and
that
was
part
of
the
political
compromise
in
the
law.
so
yes,
your
honor,
i
acknowledge
that
you
could
certainly
describe
this
as
--
as
not
a
comprehensive
regime.
there
are
holes
in
the
legislation.
but
remember,
too,
that
congress
was
not
operating
in
a
vacuum.
it
understood
that,
although
there
might
not
be
a
national
consensus
about
some
of
these
issues
and,
therefore,
the
regime
that
congress
chose
may
have
some
holes
in
it.
but
the
states
could
fill
those
holes
if
there
was
a
state-wide
consensus
on
that
issue.
and
many
states
have
done
that.
some
states
have
--
hawaii,
for
example
--
what
is
really
a
complete
gun
registration
system.
and
others,
like
west
virginia,
believe
that
there
should
be
virtually
no
regulation
of
these
sorts
of
private
sales
at
all.
and
so
i
think
the
system
is
working
precisely
as
congress
intended.
and
if
there
are
problems,
congress
will
come
back
and
fix
it.
and
we've
seen,
for
example,
in
the
firearm
owners
protection
act
and
in
the
brady
act
that
--
this
is
an
area
where
congress
is
continuing
to
observe
what's
going
on
in
the
nation
and
making
changes
to
the
law
as
necessary.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
i
wanted
to
make
that
point.
and
that
is
that,
of
course,
if
you
engage
in
the
business
of
purchasing
firearms
to
sell
to
others,
then
you
will
at
some
point
be
subject
to
the
licensing
requirements
that
congress
created.
so,
again,
this
is
not
a
system
that
has
some
obvious
loophole
where
people
can
begin
to
engage
in
their
own
sort
of
sale
of
guns
to
others.
this
is
a
situation
where
congress
wanted
to
leave
open
the
option
for
private
citizens,
like
mr.
abramski,
to
purchase
guns
for
other
lawful
gun
owners
like
family
members,
neighbors
and
friends--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
it's
true
that
he
could
not
have
walked
into
the
gun
store
and
left
the
gun
store
in
virginia
with
--
with
the
gun.
but
he
could
have
purchased
it
there.
congress
created
a
means
in
the
statute
for
the
gun
to
then
be
shipped
to
a
gun
dealer
in
pennsylvania,
and
he
would
have
to
pick
up
the
gun
and
again
fill
out
the
federal
forms
and
undergo
a
background
check
at
that
gun
dealer
in
his
home
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
meant
in
section
922(c),
which
is
the
provision
that
deals
with
absent
buyers.
and
the
concern
there
was
congress
wanted
to
leave
open
two
paths
for
gun
buyers.
one
is
to
physically
be
present
at
the
gun
store
and
fill
out
the
papers
yourself
for
the
gun
dealer.
as
you're
writing
your
name
and
age
and
your
height
and
eye
color
on
the
forms,
there's
a
person
there
looking
at
you.
and
there
was
also
an
option
that
congress
provided
for
people
to
purchase
a
gun,
for
example,
by
telephone
or
mail
or
over
the
internet
without
ever
actually
being
present,
with
no
person
being
present
in
the
gun
store.
and
it
was
in
that
circumstance
that
congress
said
we
think
we
need
a
little
bit
more
recordkeeping
in
those
cases.
so
that's
why
they
required
the
affidavit,
for
example,
and
the
--
the
waiting
period
to
provide
extra
time
for
local
law
enforcement
and
the
background
check.
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
abramski
was
physically
present
at
the
gun
store
and
so
that
provision
of
the
statute
is
not
even
implicated
here.
another
point,
your
honors,
is
that
the
plain
text
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
one
that
the
agency,
atf,
had
adopted
initially.
in
1979,
the
agency
sent
a
circular
to
gun
dealers
that
took
the
--
the
precise
position
that
--
that
petitioner
is
taking
here,
which
is
that
a
purchase
of
a
gun
for
another
lawful
gun
owner
is
permissible.
and
in
doing
so,
the
--
the
agency
said
that
that
was
an
interpretation
of
the
text
of
the
gun
control
act.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
government's
position,
but
our
position
is
that
there's
one
buyer,
and
that's
the
person
who's
actually
paying
for
the
gun,
filling
out
the
forms,
undergoing
a
background
check,
and
leaving
the
gun
--
leaving
the
gun
store
with
the
gun
in
their
hand.
and
congress
didn't
use
terms
like
"true
buyer"
or
"true
purchaser"
or
"actual
buyer"
because
they
are
not
concerned
about
the
ultimate
recipients
of
firearms
or
what
happens
to
a
gun
after
it
leaves
the
gun
store.
the
focus
of
the
gun
control
act
is
on
that
initial
purchase
and
making
sure
that
that
purchase--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--yes,
your
honor.
we
are
arguing,
yes,
that
the
person
who
pays
for
the
gun,
the
person
that's
there
in
the
gun
store,
pays
for
the
firearm
is
the
buyer.
that
is
the
--
or
the
--
in
fact,
the
term
"buyer"
isn't
even
used
in
the
gun
control
act.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
--
and
in
those
circumstances
--
again,
i
think
this
is
an
important
point
--
is
that
congress
provided
a
number
of
means
to
prosecute
illegal
straw
purchasers.
and
all
of
those
provisions
are
still
available
to
the
government,
even
if
this
court
was
to
disapprove
the
straw
purchaser
doctrine
in
all
its
applications.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
no,
your
honor.
two
points
there:
first,
as
i
mentioned,
it
would
have
been
possible
for
mr.
abramski's
uncle
to
purchase
the
gun
in
virginia.
he
could
have
gone
to
that
gun
store
and
said,
this
is
the
gun
i
want
and
paid
the
money.
he
would
have
had
to
go
back
--
the
gun
would
have
had
to
have
been
shipped
to
pennsylvania,
and
he
would
have
had
to
take
possession
of
it
in
pennsylvania
after
filling
out
additional
paperwork
and--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but,
again,
i
don't
think
that
that
changes
the
materiality
analysis,
because,
again,
the
question
is
not
whether
mr.
abramski's
uncle
could
have
picked
up
or
bought
the
gun
in
virginia.
the
question
is,
if
mr.
abramski
had
told
the
gun
dealer
the
truth,
that
yes,
i
plan
to
buy
this
gun,
but
i'm
going
to
take
it
up
to
pennsylvania
and
give
it
to
my
uncle
after
i
deliver
it
to
a
gun
dealer
there,
the
way
that
congress
wrote
the
gun
control
act,
the
gun
dealer
still
could
have
sold
the
gun
to
mr.
abramski.
and
that's
why--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--to
mr.
abramski's
uncle?
mr.
richard
d
dietz
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
abramski's
uncle
could
not
take
--
could
not
have
bought
the
gun
in
another
state
and
taken
possession
of
it.
but,
again,
for
the
materiality
question,
the
way
this
court
has
described
that
standard
in
kungys
is
whether
--
if
mr.
abramski
had
provided
the
truthful
information,
if
that
would
have
been
capable
of
influencing
the
outcome
in
that
case--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--your
honor--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--yes.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
reason
is
that
the
government's
position
is
that
you
cannot
buy
a
gun
intending
to
sell
it
to
another
lawful
gun
owner.
that
is
the
government's
position.
but
just
one
point
of
clarification
is,
to
the
extent
it's
relevant,
mr.
abramski
did
not
receive
consideration
for
the
purchase
of
the
firearm.
the
record
indicates
that
his
uncle
sent
him
a
check
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
gun.
this
was,
in
all
respects,
someone
doing
a
favor
for
a
family
member.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
yes,
your
honor.
that
count
--
the
language
of
the
congress
was
that
one
cannot
"make
a
false
statement
about
information
required
by
this
chapter
to
be
kept.
"
44,
the
gun
control
act
itself.
and
the
gun
control
act
contains
--
it
actually
references
a
provision,
and
that's
922(b)(5),
where
congress
says
this
is
the
information
that
uses
that
term,
"required
to
be
kept".
and
it
lists
three
things:
the
name,
age,
and
place
of
residence
of
the
person
acquiring
the
gun
from
the
gun
dealer.
and
then
atf
has
promulgated
regulations
that
have
added
an
additional
layer
of
information
that
must
be
included
on
the
forms.
but
the
government's
position
--
of
course,
this
question
11,
who
is
the
actual
buyer,
that's
not
one
of
the
things
that's
included
either
in
the
text
of
the
gun
control
act
or
in
atf's
regulations.
and
what
the
government
has
said
in
this
case
is,
well,
that's
right,
but
we
view
the
authorization
of
congress
to
create
the
form
as
sort
of
a
blanket
authorization
to
put
--
ask
whatever
we
want
in
the
form
and
make
anything
that
we
ask
in
the
form
information
required
to
be
kept.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
your
honor,
i
think
the
key
in
this
case
is
that
congress
included
a
materiality
element
for
almost
every
false
statement
that
would
occur
in
this
context.
and
they
enacted
a
separate
statute
that
did
not
have
that
materiality
requirement.
and
the
reason
was
congress
wanted
to
be
sure
that
that
provision
that
did
not
have
the
materiality
requirement
only
applied
to
the
false
statements
that
congress
thought
were
the
very
important
ones,
and
therefore
they
delineated
what
those
--
that
category
of
statements
was.
and
the
question
on
the
form
is
not
one
of
them.
and
that,
your
honor,
is
the
reason
why
mr.
abramski
cannot
be
convicted
under
that
provision.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
counsel
whether
this
was
a
case
where
there
were
two
interpretations
of
the
statute.
counsel
conceded
that
there
were.
i
think
that's
an
important
point
because,
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
a
criminal
statute.
if
there
are
two
interpretations
under
very
well-settled
precedent
from
this
court,
the
court
applies
the
interpretation
that's
favorable
to
the
criminal
defendant
and
that's
part
of
the
doctrine
of
criminal
law.
justice
kennedy,
you
--
you
mentioned
the
--
the
agency
situation
that
existed
here
between
mr.
abramski
and
his
uncle.
and
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
there
wasn't
even
any
consideration.
this
was
truly
a
purchase
that
was
just
a
favor
for
a
family
member.
and
the
government,
in
order
to
advance
this
straw
purchaser
theory
that
historically
came
from
civil
common
law,
there
needs
to
be
a
relationship
between
mr.
abramski
and
his
uncle
that
is
a
fiduciary
relationship
where
mr.
abramski
is
required
to
act
in
his
uncle's
best
interests
at
all
times.
and
that,
for
example,
if
he
left
the
gun
store
and
someone
said,
hey,
did
you
just
pick
up
a
glock,
i'll
buy
it
for
you
for
$500,
that
mr.
abramski
could
not
even
enter
into
that
sale
without
providing
his
uncle
with
--
with
any
money
he
made
from
that
sale.
and
there's
--
there's
a
complex
set
of
civil
agency
law
principles
that
apply
here
that
just
don't
translate
to
the
straw
purchaser
doctrine
as
we've
described
it.
and
i
think
that's
a
fundamental
flaw
in
the
government's
theory
is
that
the
courts
just
have
never
thought
through
all
of
the
various
situations
that
apply
in
these
fiduciary
relationships
and
how
you
would
apply
them
to
situations
where
you're
just
buying
a
gun
for
a
family
member
or
something
of
that
nature.
i
also
wanted
to
turn
to
the
gift
exception.
there's
also
another
exception
the
government
acknowledges
and
that's
for
raffles
and
contests
at
charities
or,
you
know,
political
fundraisers.
and
so
in
that
circumstance,
the
person
who's
buying
the
gun
knows
that
they're
giving
it
to
a
complete
stranger
and
someone
who
by
random
chance
wins
the
right
to
own
the
gun.
but
in
those
cases,
the
government
says
there's
no
need,
at
the
time
that
you
buy
the
gun,
to
take
any
steps
to
ensure
there's
recordkeeping
or
a
background
check
on
that
person.
and
i
think
that
undermines
this
idea
that
everyone
receiving
a
gun
in
the
chain
from
the
gun
dealer
congress
wants
to
have
a
background
check.
congress
is
concerned
about
providing
enough
information
to
allow
for
tracing
and
nothing
more.
and
as
a
final
point,
your
honors,
i
think,
perhaps,
the
most
important
point
in
this
case
is
if
the
court
rejects
the
straw
purchaser
doctrine
as
it
--
as
it
applies
in
this
case
to
a
lawful
gun
owner
buying
for
another,
there
are
really
no
harmful
consequences.
the
government
retains
a
very
robust
toolbox
of
criminal
statutes
to
prosecute
illegal
straw
purchasers,
those
who
buy
guns
to
get
them
into
the
hands
of
prohibited
persons,
and
the
government
will
receive
accurate,
truthful
information
about
that
first
sale
so
they
can
trace
firearms
when
they're
used
in
the
commission
of
a
crime.
so
the
only
thing
the
straw
purchaser
doctrine
in
this
case
really
accomplishes
is
to
prohibit
law-abiding
citizens
from
buying
guns
for
other
law-abiding
citizens,
and
that's
something
that
congress
expressly
chose
not
to
do.
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
remain
faithful
to
the
statutory
scheme
actually
enacted
by
congress.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
i
think
the
government
would
have
the
burden
there,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
government
has
suggested
--
they
provide
an
example
of
a
circumstance
where
the
--
the
person
who
bought
the
gun
was
buying
it
for
someone
named,
i
believe,
almonio,
who
they
had
no
idea
who
that
was.
but,
yes,
in
that
circumstance,
the
government
would
need
to
prove
that
that
person
was
prohibited.
but
i
think
in
circumstances
like
that
where
you're
buying
guns
for
someone
you
don't
even
know
who
that
person
is,
the
government
may
well
have
evidence
in
that
case
that
you
either
knew
or
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
that
person
was
prohibited
from
possessing
a
gun.
mr.
richard
d
dietz
that's
right,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
you
can't
run
a
check
on
someone
who
wins
the
gun
in
a
raffle
or--
mr.
richard
d
dietz
--thank
you.
