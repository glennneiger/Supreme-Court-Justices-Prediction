justice
stephen
g.
breyer
language
matters
in
a
statute.
i
mean,
i
do
believe
that.
and
here
the
relevant
language
seems
to
me,
what
is
material
to
the
government
says
--
is
the
statute
about
selling
or
delivering.
now,
did
this
person
--
was
he
the
buyer,
your
client?
was
he
somebody
that
they
sold
or
delivered
it
to?
well,
he's
a
straw.
a
straw
purchaser
is
someone
who
doesn't
purchase.
the
person
who
purchases
is
the
person
who
uses
the
straw.
now,
you
can't
say
that
about
a
giver,
a
benefactor
is
--
the
person
who's
the
beneficiary
of
the
benefactor
is
not
the
purchaser.
but
the
straw
purchaser
is
not
the
purchaser.
and
it
comes
from
"straw
bail"
where
someone
else
put
up
the
bail
and
it
was
called
straw
because
the
people
who
made
a
career
of
that
used
to
wear
straw
in
their
shoes.
interesting.
but
in
terms
of
--
in
terms
of
this
case,
the
straw--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i
didn't.
i
thought
it
came
from
the
wizard
of
oz,
but
it
doesn't--
[laughter]
the
fact
is
that
is
where
it
comes
from.
i
think
in
every
legal
context
it
means
someone
who
is
not
the
real.
so
who
is
the
real?
in
this
case
it
is
the
person
for
whom
the
straw
purchased.
so
we
fit
that
within
the
language.
we
can't
fit
the
beneficiary
of
a
gift
within
the
language
and
that's
the
reason
for
the
distinction,
and
so
why
not
do
it
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
awfully
broad.
it
isn't
the
language,
i
think.
the
statute,
it
has
to
be
material
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
sale.
now,
we
look
to
see
what
section
is
it
material
to,
and
you
say
in
your
brief
it's
material
to
the
section
that
says
--
you
have
two
of
them,
but
they
come
to
the
same
thing
--
selling
or
delivering
any
firearm
to
any
person.
all
right.
now,
he
says
did
they
sell
or
deliver
this
firearm
to
what
you
call
the
real
purchaser.
no.
they
sold
or
delivered
it
to
the
straw,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
and
at
least
the
statute
is
open
to
this
interpretation,
and
it's
a
criminal
statute.
and
besides,
the
atf
for
a
long
time
interpreted
it
that
way.
so
what
we
should
do
is
interpret
it
strictly.
now,
that's
i
think
the
basis
of
their
argument
if
i
understand
it.
and
so
you
have
to
get
those
words
"sale"
and
"deliver"
and
explain
how
in
a
criminal
statute
they
apply
to
what
you're
calling
the
real
purchaser.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
also
quote
"material",
the
need
for
it
to
be
material
to
the
lawful
ness
of
the
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
seem
to
concede
that
in
the
brief.
it
has
to
be
material,
and
there
are
two
sections
and
both
come
to
the
same
thing,
which
is
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
was
--
if
he
then
--
if
he
is
the
actual
purchaser,
then
he
falls
within
the
term
of
a
person
to
whom
the
firearm
was
sold
or
delivered.
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
there's
no
question
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
still
--
look,
what
i
thought
was
a
very
good
argument
on
your
side
is
exactly
what
i
said.
the
narrow
interpretation
would
also
apply
to
a
straw
man
who
buys
a
gun
for
al
capone.
and
so
this
--
this
part
of
the
statute
would
be
virtually
worthless.
their
response
to
that
is
don't
worry
about
that.
there
are
plenty
of
other
provisions
that
will
take
care
of
that.
are
there?
and
if
it's
so
obvious
about
the
al
capone,
why
did
the
atf
decide
it
their
way
for
20
years?
i
mean,
how
--
how
did
they
get
into
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
going
to
be
the
same
problem,
which
is
the
straw
because
the
transferee,
in
context,
probably
refers
to
the
person
to
whom
the
dealer
transferred
the
weapon;
namely,
the
buyer.
and
does
it
apply,
for
example,
if
he
knows
that
the
buyer
is
going
to
give
the
--
the
weapon
to
another
person?
and
you
will
say
no.
then
he's
not
the
transferee,
the
other
person.
you
admit
that.
you
say
it.
and
so
why
is
the
person
to
whom
--
the
one
who
puts
up
the
cash
is
going
to
later
transfer
the
weapon
is
the
same
question
as
to
whether
he
is
really
the
purchaser.
i
just
don't
see
a
difference.
and,
therefore,
i
thought
--
but
you
can
explain
to
me
why
there's
a
difference.
i'd
like
to
know
that.
and
i
guess
i'd
like
to
bring
you
back
to
the
--
to
that
issue
and
--
and
i'd
just
like
to
know
how
the
atf
reached
the
contrary
conclusion
if
it
would
so
undermine
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
about
the
donee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
other
purpose
that
they
said
this
provision
has
is
to
get
gun
dealers
to
run
checks.
and
you
can't
run
a
check
if
the
name
isn't
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
the
other
problem
--
we're
back
to
the
language.
the
--
there
--
they
say
your
client,
you
know,
falls
within
the
language
and
you
say
he
doesn't.
is
it
--
all
right.
forget
it.
