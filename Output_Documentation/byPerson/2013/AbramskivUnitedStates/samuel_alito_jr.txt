justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
the
gift
--
in
the
gift
situation.
but
congress
requires
certain
information
from
the
buyer,
whatever
that
means;
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
--
the
dealer
has
to
record
the
name
of
the
buyer;
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
address
of
the
buyer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
do
an
instant
check
on
the
buyer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
why
would
--
why
would
congress
have
wanted
those
things
with
respect
to
the
person
who
was
just
the
straw
purchaser
and
not
the
person
--
the
person
who's
actually
going
to
acquire
the
weapon?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
they
be
concerned
about
the
starting
point?
let's
say
there's
a
man,
mr.
straw,
and
he
holds
himself
out
as
a
gun
buyer,
puts,
you
know,
a
website,
creates
a
website.
he
puts
something
in
the
yellow
pages
under
"straw
man".
and
he
says:
you
want
to
acquire
a
gun
and
you
don't
want
the
dealer
to
record
your
name
and
you
don't
want
to
have
an
instant
check
on
you,
you
come
to
me.
and
so
these
people
come
to
him
and
whenever
they
do,
he
goes
to
joe's
gun
shop
and
--
with
the
other
person.
he
says,
i
want
to
buy
a
gun,
but
this
fellow
with
me
is
going
to
do
all
the
talking.
so
the
guy
who's
with
him
talks
with
joe
about
different
types
of
guns,
costs
and
everything.
after
that's
done,
the
person
who's
done
all
the
talking
says,
now,
my
friend,
mr.
straw,
is
going
to
buy
this
gun.
he
gives
mr.
straw
the
money,
mr.
straw
buys
the
gun,
and
the
dealer
writes
down
mr.
straw's
name
for
the
fifteenth
time
that
month,
his
address,
does
another
instant
check
on
it.
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
still
have
not
explained
what
purpose
is
served
by
obtaining
the
name
of
the
straw
purchaser
and
doing
an
instant
check
on
the
straw
purchaser.
you
said
that
it
allows
the
tracing
of
the
weapon,
but
that's
not
going
to
be
true
in
the
case
of
a
straw
purchaser,
because
the
person,
the
straw
purchaser,
isn't
necessarily
and
probably
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
isn't
going
to
get
the
name
or
any
information
about
the
actual
recipient.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
having
a
straw
purchaser.
so
then
what
purpose
is
served
by
this?
it's
just
meaningless.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
they
find
the
gun
dealer
and
the
gun
dealer
says,
i
sold
it
to
mr.
straw.
and
then
they
go
to
mr.
straw
and
mr.
straw
said:
my
client
took
it.
okay,
who's
your
client?
i
have
no
idea.
he
came
into
my
store.
he
contacted
me.
i
didn't
ask
his
name.
he
didn't
give
me
his
name.
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
so
no
purpose
is
served
by
putting
down
the
name,
the
address,
doing
the
check
on
the
straw
purchaser.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
you're
saying
is
they
did
a
meaningless
thing.
that
was
the
compromise.
they
would
do
something
that's
utterly
meaningless.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
first
point
about
the
straw
purchaser,
would
you
--
would
you
lose
on
the
grounds
that
mr.
abramski's
uncle
could
not
have
lawfully
purchased
the
gun
at
that
store
because
he
wasn't
a
resident
of
the
state?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
he
couldn't
have
taken
possession
of
it
in
--
in
pennsylvania.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
virginia.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
would
it
have
been
a
lawful
sale
if
the
gun
had
been
delivered
to
him
on
the
spot?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
he
could
not
--
mr.
abramski
is
out
of
the
picture
and
the
uncle
goes
in,
buys
the
gun,
puts
down
a
pennsylvania
address.
the
dealer
gives
him
the
gun
and
walks
out
of
the
store.
that
--
would
that
be
a
lawful
sale?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
meant
my
hypothetical.
so
he
doesn't
have
--
he
doesn't
put
it
in
the
yellow
pages
and
he
doesn't
put
it
on
the
internet.
he
just
hangs
around
in
the
parking
lot
at
joe's
to
accommodate
people
who
--
and
joe's
is
near
the
border,
and
he
wants
to
accommodate
people
who
may
take
it
--
who
wish
to
employ
him
as
a
straw
purchaser.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
the
--
on
the
second
argument,
would
the
government
have
to
prove
that
the
person
to
whom
the
straw
purchaser
transferred
the
gun
was
ineligible
or
would
it
be
a
defense
if
it
was
shown
that
the
person
was
eligible?
