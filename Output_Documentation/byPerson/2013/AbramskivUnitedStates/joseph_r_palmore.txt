mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
could,
at
the
outset,
frame
what
i
see
as
the
issues
here
because,
as
some
of
the
questioning
revealed,
petitioner
is
making
two
separate
arguments.
his
first
argument
is,
in
a
sense,
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
straw
purchaser
doctrine.
i
take
that
actually
as
a
falsity
argument.
he's
saying
when
i
answered
that
i
was
the
purchaser,
that
was
a
true
statement
because
i'm
the
only
purchaser
who
counted
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
because
i
was
the
one
standing
there
and
i
was
the
one
filling
out
the
form.
his
second
argument
is
an
alternative
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
and
he
says,
even
assuming
i'm
wrong
about
the
first
argument
and
that
this
statement
was
false,
that
that
falsehood
was
not
material
because
my
uncle
was
legally
eligible
to
possess
a
firearm.
so
i'd
like
to
take
those
two
arguments
in
--
in
order.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think,
in
a
sense,
you
could
understand
there
to
be
two
buyers.
the
buyer
who
counts
under
the
statute,
though,
is
the
actual
buyer.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
justice
scalia,
if
you
--
if
you
hypothesize
the
situation
in
which
two
roommates
wanted
to
buy
a
firearm
together
--
firearms
are
expensive;
they
can't
each
afford
their
own,
but
they
want
one
for
personal
protection.
and
if
one
went
into
the
store
and
said,
i'm
buying
this
firearm
for
myself
and
my
roommate
who's
not
here,
that
transaction
could
not
lawfully
go
forward,
because
the
two
buyers
of
the
firearm
weren't
in
the
store
and
they
weren't
physically
present
and
they
didn't
go
through
all
the
statutory
screening
processes.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
in
that,
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
in
the
straw
purchaser
cases
the
person
takes
possession
in
an
ephemeral
sense.
they
are
merely
the
conduit.
the
whole
--
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
transaction
is
to
deliver
that
firearm
to
someone
else.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
if
there
are
two
buyers,
the
two
people,
the
roommates,
are
buying,
they
would
each
need
to--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
of
course
the
form
tells
you
who
the
real
buyer
is,
and
it's
a
substance
over
form
inquiry.
and
we
think
this
is
supported
by
not
only
the
text,
but
also
the
structure
and
purpose
of
the
gun
control
act.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that
is
atf's
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
i
was
just
going
to
get
to
that.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that's
the
current
one,
and
it's
been
consistent
for
the
last
20
years,
justice
scalia.
so
the
statute,
we
think
the
text
and
structure
and
purpose
support
this
view.
the
text
is
most
readily
identifiable
in
section
922(a)(6)
itself,
which
this
court
in
huddleston--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--922(a)(6),
which
is
the
count
1
of
the
conviction.
it's
the
false
statement
provision
at
issue
here,
and
this
is
quoted
on
pages
1
through
2
of
the
government's
brief.
so
the
provision
says:
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
or
attempted
acquisition
of
a
firearm.
"
and
it
goes
on,
and
it
talks
--
and
at
the
end
it
talks
about
the
"lawfulness
of
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
such
firearm.
"
this
case
isn't
the
first
one
in
which
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
interpret
those
terms.
in
huddleston
the
court
looked
at
those
terms,
in
particular
"acquisition"
and
"disposition",
and
it
said
several
things
about
those
terms
that
are
relevant
here.
it
said
those
terms
are
meant
to
have
a
practical,
common
sense
meaning
in
terms
of
who
will
come
into
possession
and
control
of
a
firearm
as
the
result
of
a
transaction
with
a
federally
regulated
dealer,
and
they
don't
turn
on
formal
notions
of
legal
title;
and
that
with
respect
to
"disposition"
in
particular
that
congress
meant
to
give
broad
effect
to
this
term.
and
so
we
think
that
the
same
kind
of
practical
common
sense
inquiry
is
applicable
here.
when
looking
at
the
transaction
the
question
is
what
is
the
ultimate
purpose
and
effect
of
this
transaction.
is
it
to
have
someone
else
acquire
the
firearm.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right,
justice
breyer.
the
statute
uses
a
number
of
different
terms
to
connote
what
we
take
to
be
a
substance
over
form
inquiry
into
the
actual
possession
and
control
of
the
firearm.
so
in
922(a)(6),
as
we
were
just
talking
about,
it
was
talking
about
acquisition,
sale,
or
disposition.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
so
this
is
where
we
get
back
to
the
fact
that
there
are
two
different
issues
in
this
case.
if
i
convince
you
that
there
was
a
false
statement
here
because
petitioner's
uncle
was
the
actual
purchaser--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--and
his
name
wasn't
put
on
the
farm.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right.
if
i
could
just
finish
one
other
thought
on
this
first
issue
of
falsity.
as
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
alito's
hypotheticals
demonstrated,
under
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
i
could
approach
someone
in
a
parking
lot
outside
of
a
licensed
dealer.
i
could
say,
would
you
like
to
make
a
quick
buck;
please
come
in
with
me.
i
could
point
to
the
firearm
i
want.
i
could
hand
him
the
money.
i
could
look
over
his
shoulder
as
his
fills
out
form
4473
in
his
own
name.
i
could
watch
the
dealer
run
that
person's
name
and
identity
through
the
criminal
background
check,
and
as
we
leave
the
shop
together
he
could
hand
me
that
firearm.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
you
could,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
justice
scalia,
congress
was
obviously
balancing
a
number
of
interests
when
it
enacted
these
provisions.
if
you
read
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
it's
clear
that
congress
thought
the
principal
problem
was
effectively
unregulated
sales
of
firearms
from
dealers.
that's
the
problem
it
wanted
to
focus
on.
and
you're
right
that
it
didn't
want
to
go
further
and
intrude
on
private
transactions
among
unlicensed
individuals.
it
drew
a
line,
and
it
--
but
it
drew
a
line
at
a
point
where
it
thought
the
actual
problem
was.
and
that
line
was
up
to
and
including
the
point
of
sale.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
there
was
not,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i
think
that
takes
us
to
the
second
issue
here,
which
is
the
materiality
issue.
and
i
think
what
happened
was
that
the
agency's
earlier
view
of
the
statute
was
essentially
overtaken
by
the
case
law
in
several
respects.
and
the
agency
therefore
updated
its
view
and
has
consistently
applied
that
view
for
the
last
20
years.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
--
that
the
other
provisions
that
petitioner
is
referring
to
is
922(d),
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
anyone,
licensed
or
unlicensed,
to
transfer
a
firearm
to
someone
in
a
prohibited
category
if
the
transferor
knows
or
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
in
a
prohibited
category.
and
that
is
a
completely
inadequate
substitute
for
what
--
the
kind
of
regulation
we're
talking
here
for
--
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
is
mens
rea
requirement
that
i
just
mentioned.
so
in
my
--
my
hypothetical
involving
the
parking
lot,
the
person
--
the
straw
purchaser
doesn't
even
know
my
name,
much
less
anything
about
my
background,
whether
i
was
dishonorably
discharged
from
the
military,
whether
i
have
mental
health
issues.
doesn't
know
nothing
about
me.
he
has
no
reason
to
ask.
i
certainly
have
no
motivation
to
tell
him.
and
yet
that
transaction
can
go
forward,
and
there
could
be
--
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prosecute
that
straw
purchaser
for
an
illegal
transfer
if
it
turned
out
that
i
was
a
felon.
second
is
the
whole
purpose
of
this
structure
of
this
statute,
especially
after
it
was
amended
in
the
early
'90s,
was
to
not
--
was
to
put
in
place
and
reinforce
a
dealer-based
regulatory
system
in
which
the
eligibility
of
firearm
transferees
is
determined
based
on
a
search
through
a
database.
we
don't
take
even
the
transfer
--
transferees
say
so
as
to
whether
or
not
he's
an
eligible
person.
he
has
to
fill
out
the
firm.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
you're
right,
your
honor,
just
as
there's
nothing
in
the
mail
or
wire
fraud
statute
that
talks
about
ponzi
schemes.
that
--
a
ponzi
scheme
is
simply
a
way--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--your
honor,
i
think
we
do
have
a
textual
argument,
which
i
referred
to
before.
but
there's
also
--
it's
not
just
a
purpose
argument.
it's
a
contextual
and
structural
argument.
and
it's
the
one
that
justice
alito
alluded
to
in
response--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--at
a
certain
point,
a
person
is--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
if
they're
operating
as
a
seller
of
firearms,
they
would
have
to
register.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
mean,
at
a
certain
point,
if
the
--
if
the
conduct
is
so
pervasive
and
regular,
if
he's
acting
as
a
dealer,
then
you
might
be
able
to
get
him
on
that
separate
provision.
but
you're
right.
before
that
point,
you
wouldn't
necessarily
be
able
to,
and
that
would
be
a
perfectly
lawful
--
lawful
conduct.
and
it's
also
important
to
talk
--
we
were
talking,
justice
breyer,
about--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yeah.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
and
my
point,
justice
scalia,
is
that
in
a
straw-purchase
context,
you're
not
necessarily
going
to
know
you're
dealing
with
al
capone
or
someone
of
his
record.
these
are
often
cases
in
which
people
have
an
ephemeral
relationship.
they
may
not
even
know
each
other's
names.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kagan.
and
that's
his
first
argument
and
what
i
take
to
be
his
main
submission
is
essentially
that
his
statement
was
true.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right,
he
did.
it
was
true,
so
you
don't
even
get
to
the
materiality
question.
so
that's
right.
that
subsequent
transfer
might
separately
be
a
violation
if
he
knows
or
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
transferee
is
in
a
prohibited
category.
i
would
just
point
out,
though,
that
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
from
1968
to
1986
because
922(d),
which
prohibits
transfers
to
ineligible
transferors
--
i'm
sorry
--
transferees
applied
only
to
licensed
dealers
until
1986.
it
didn't
apply
to
--
to
private
individuals.
so
the
kind
of
straw
purchase
on
behalf
of
al
capone,
as
i
understand
it
under
petitioner's
theory,
would
have
been
perfectly
legal
from
1968
to
1986,
even
if
it
was
knowing.
justice
ginsburg,
we
talked
a
little
bit
before
about
how
atf's
view
kind
of
caught
up
with
the
case
law.
and
i
think
some
of
that
case
law
is
actually
quite
helpful
here
for
illuminating
the
materiality
question.
and
it's
the
crandall
case
from
the
first
circuit
that
we
talk
about
in
the
brief.
if
petitioner
is
correct
that
the
materiality
of
a
false
statement
turns
on
whether
the
ultimate
--
in
this
context,
whether
the
ultimate
purchaser
or
the
actual
transferee
of
the
firearm
was
eligible
or
not,
it's
unclear
why
a
--
someone
seeking
to
buy
a
gun
from
a
federally
regulated
dealer
couldn't
go
in,
provide
a
false
name
and
provide
a
false
identification
and
receive
a
gun.
and
then
if
he's
prosecuted
for
that
false
statement,
he
could
defend,
as
the
defendant
in
crandall
tried
to
defend,
saying,
well,
it
didn't
really
matter
because
i'm
actually
eligible.
so
even
if
you'd
known
my
true
name
and
had
my
true
nonforged
id,
he
would
have
sold
me
the
gun,
so
it's
not
material.
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
lower
courts
have
consistently
rejected
that
argument.
and
what
those
courts
hold
is
that
in
all
cases,
the
lawfulness
of
the
sale
of
a
firearm
from
a
regulated
dealer
is
contingent
on
the
recording,
confirming,
and
after
1993,
screening
of
the
identity
of
the
purchaser.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that's
one
of
the
provisions.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right.
and
if
you're
with
me
on
the
straw
purchase
idea,
that
this
was
a
false
statement
because
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
transaction
was
to
--
for
the
uncle
to
acquire
the
firearm,
then
that
was
a
false
statement,
then
the
actual
purchaser
name
is
recorded--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--if
you
assume
i'm
right
on
issue
1,
then
i
think
that
the
materiality
on
issue
2
follows
directly
from
--
from
this
provision
that
you
quote
in
922(b)(5).
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes.
and
i
think
the
term
needs
to
be
looked
at
in
context.
it's
not
just
922(b)(5).
there's
also
922(t),
which
is
the
brady
provisions,
and
there
it
talks
about
a
transfer,
so
we
talked
before
about
how
there
are
different
terms
that
are
used.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--(t),
which
says
that
you
can't--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--this
is
on
page
13.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
no,
i
apologize,
justice
scalia.
there's
not
an
appendix,
but
this
is
quoted,
in
relevant
part,
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
so
922(t)
says
that
the
--
no
transfer
of
a
firearm
can
take
place
unless
the
identity
of
the
--
of
transferee
is
confirmed
with
a
photo
identification
and
unless
that
identity
is
screened
through
a
database
to
ensure
that
that
person
is
eligible.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kagan.
i
think
that
anyone
looking
at
922(b)(5),
chief
justice
roberts--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--you're
right.
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
i
apologize
for
not
including
a
fuller
statutory
appendix
in
this
brief.
but
the
point
is
of
922(b)(5)
when
it
asks
for
the
name
of
the
buyer,
one
would
ask,
well,
what
--
what
reason
--
why
is
this
name
relevant?
why
is
this
question
being
asked?
and
this
goes
to
justice
alito's
observation
about
the
structure
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
this
name
is
clearly
being
asked
because
congress
cared
very
much
about
preventing
anonymous
sales
of
firearms.
it
cared
very
much
about
having
a
record
of
who
that
first
buyer
was.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
--
i
agree,
because
those
requirements
would
be
pointless
if
they
could
be
satisfied.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
justice
breyer,
a
couple
of
points
about
this.
one,
as
we
talked
about
before,
we
think
huddleston
suggests
that
these
terms
--
and
huddleston
was
interpret
--
was
interpreting
acquisition
and
disposition,
and
it
gave
--
it
was
stressed
that
these
had
a
practical,
common
sense
meaning
about
who
was
going
to
obtain
possession
or
control
of
the
firearm
as
a
result
of
the
transaction,
as
a
direct
result
of
the
transaction.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
the
atf
has
never
interpreted
this
provision
to
--
to
prohibit
gifts.
and
a
gift
recipient
is
in
no
sense
a
party
to
the
gift
giver's
purchase
of
the
gift.
that's
just
not
the
way
we
think
of
gifts.
the
purchaser
may
change
his
mind.
the
purchaser
is
not
acting
at
the
direction
and
control
of
the
gift
recipient.
and
in
atf's
experience,
there's
not
a
problem
with
gift
recipients.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i
think
that
that
--
i
would
suggest
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
gift
under
that
scenario,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that
person
is
working
for
the
crime
boss
and
as
part
of
his
duties
to
go
obtain
a
gun,
then
he's
buying
that
gun
on
behalf
of
the
crime
boss.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
the
question
--
there
could
be
a
factual
question
in
some
of
these
cases.
the
question
would
be:
was
that
purchase
made
on
behalf
of
someone
else?
there's
no
factual
issue
here.
this
was
a
guilty
plea,
so
we
have
to
assume
that
this
transaction
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
uncle.
as
a
factual
matter,
petitioner
disputes
whether
that
matters
legally
or
not
and--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
and
in
your
hypothetical,
i
think
that
would
be
a
straw
purchase.
that
purchase
was
made
--
even
if
the
money
was
going
to
come
later,
that
purchase
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
absent
party
and
it
can't
proceed
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--justice
scalia,
and
huddleston
is
helpful
in
this
regard,
too.
there
was
a
notice
rule
of
lenity
argument
made
there
because
the
person
in
that
case
wasn't
actually
buying
the
firearm.
he
had
pawned
it
to
the
pawn
shop
and
he
was
redeeming
it.
and
he
came
in
and
said,
i'm
not
buying
it,
i'm
just
getting
my
own
property
back.
i'm
not
buying
it
or
acquiring
it.
and
the
court
relied,
in
rejecting
that
argument,
relied
in
part
on
form
4473,
because
it
provided
notice
that
he
had
to
check
these
boxes
and
had
to
truthfully
answer
the
question.
i
think
it's
rare
that
you
get
a
case
with
this
degree
of
notice.
when
the
--
when
the
defendant
is
actually
committing
the
offense
and
making
the
false
statement,
he's
told
in
bold
letters
right
in
front
of
him
not
to
do
what
he's
about
to
do
and
it
--
and
it
includes
a
hypothetical--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that's
right,
your
--
chief
justice
roberts.
it's
a
form
that's
been
used
consistently
for
--
for
20
years.
and
for
the
reasons
that
we've
said,
we
think
that
the
--
the
current
view
of
the
atf
and
the
express
instructions
on
the
form
are
actually
the
most
consistent
with
the
statute,
because
the
statute
requires
identification
of
a
firearm
purchaser
to
be
recorded,
confirmed,
and
screened
in
every
case.
that's
not
contingent
on
the
person
turning
out
to
be
eligible
or
not.
congress
wanted
to
prevent
anonymous
sales
of
firearms,
and
it
had
a
purpose,
obviously,
to
keep--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
it's
not
clear,
justice
kennedy.
there
might
be
--
there
might
be
a
contract
between--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
but,
of
course,
here
there's
no
subsequent
sale
because
the
check
was
written
beforehand.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right.
i
think
if
--
if
the
petitioner
changed
his
mind
and
decided
not
to
actually
transfer
it,
i
think,
as
a
technical
matter,
that
wouldn't
affect
the
legality
because
what
mattered
was,
was
he
making
a
purchase
on
behalf
of
another
and
entering
a
false
statement
at
the
time
he
made
it.
a
fact
question
could
arise
in
a
--
in
a
situation
like
that,
which
a
defendant
could
argue,
i
wasn't
actually
making
the
purchase
on
behalf
of
someone
else,
and
that
argument
is
supported
by
subsequent
events.
but
i
think
we
were
--
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
one
critical
purpose
of
the
statute,
obviously,
was
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
ineligible
persons,
but
another
critical
purpose
was
to
offer
the
tracing
of
firearms
and
to
prevent
the
anonymous
stockpiling
of
firearms.
and
with
respect
to
that
purpose,
i
think
the
facts
of
some
of
the
cases
underlying
the
circuit
split
on
the
second
issue
of
materiality
are
quite
salient.
those
are
all
cases
in
which
eligible
parties
wanted
to
anonymously
obtain
large
quantities
of
firearms
for
illicit
reasons.
they
were
eligible,
but
they
had
--
they
wanted
to
not
have
their
name
associated
with
the
transaction.
so
polk,
which
is
the
fifth
circuit
case,
which
is
actually
on
petitioner's
side,
that
person
wanted
to
anonymously
acquire
firearms
to
create
a
stockpile
to
attack
an
irs
building,
to
kill
police
officers,
and
to
assassinate
a
judge.
but
he
was
eligible.
in
frazier
and
morales,
which
are
the
eleventh
and
sixth
circuit
cases
addressing
this
materiality
issue,
there
were
straw
purchases
on
behalf
of
eligible
buyers,
but
they
were,
again,
wanting
to
anonymously
stockpile
weapons
and
not
have
their
names
associated
with
them
because
they
were
smuggling
them
out
of
the
country.
and
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
in
which
a
straw
purchaser
can
satisfy
the
requirement
that
the
first
transaction,
at
the
point
of
sale
be
recorded
would
completely
satisfy
the
statutory
requirements,
would
greatly
impair
the
ability
of
atf
to
trace
firearms
and
to
have
an
accurate
record
of
who
that
first
purchaser
of
the
firearm
was.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'd
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
