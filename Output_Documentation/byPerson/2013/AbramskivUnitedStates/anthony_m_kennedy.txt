your
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
material
misstatement;
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
material
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
question
that
was
on
the
government
form
that
was
promulgated,
that
was
directed
by
regulations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
describing
what
happened
here,
you
--
you
--
you
said
that
abramski
went
in
and
then
went
to
pennsylvania
and
gave
the
gun
to
his
uncle.
that's
not
quite
correct.
he
--
he
transferred
it
to
him
for
consideration.
i
had
thought,
and
this
was
--
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
--
question
about
if
there's
one
buyer
here
or
two.
i
had
thought
that
it
might
be
possible
that
you
can
--
to
construct
a
case
where
abramski
tells
his
uncle,
i'm
going
to
buy
the
gun,
and
then
i'm
going
to
sell
it
to
you,
and
i'm
going
to
sell
it
to
you
in
pennsylvania
at
a
gun
dealer's
store
so
we
can
fill
out
the
necessary
forms.
would
the
government
then
have
objected
to
what
happened
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
we
can
ask
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
justice
scalia
indicates,
but
under
--
as
you
understand
their
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
sale,
suppose
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
was
a
glock,
i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
--
was
delivered,
and
suddenly
the
--
abramski
finds
that
it's
a
valuable
collector's
item.
there
were
only
two
or
three
of
these
made,
had
a
special
trigger
or
something,
and
it's
now
immensely
valuable.
could
the
uncle
insist
that
it
be
sold
to
him
for
the
$700,
or
for
the
--
for
the
agreed
price?
the
$400
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it
isn't
--
if
it
isn't,
then
there
wasn't
--
then
there
--
there
was
a
subsequent
sale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
about
that.
