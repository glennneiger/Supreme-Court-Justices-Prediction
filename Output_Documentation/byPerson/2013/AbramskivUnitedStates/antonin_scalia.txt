justice
antonin
scalia
please
finish
what
you
were
saying.
i
--
i
didn't
understand
what
your
point
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
your
answer
to
what
sense
it
makes
is
that
was
the
compromise,
that
there
was
strong
opposition
to
any
gun
control
law,
and
the
condition
was
you
get
the
buyer
and
you
don't
make
the
buyer
promise
not
to
give
it
to
somebody
else.
he
could
immediately
give
it
to
somebody
who's
unqualified
to
own
the
gun,
couldn't
he?
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
somebody,
somebody
who
is
qualified
to
own
a
firearm?
can
i
take
a
firearm
that
i
own
and
say,
you
know,
it's
yours?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
have
to
register
it?
i
don't
have
to
go
through
a
firearm
dealer,
right?
it's
my
gun
and
i
can
give
it
to
somebody
else
who's
qualified.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
never
going
to
know
who
the
end
user
is
once
the
gun
is
sold,
whether
you
take
the,
you
know,
the
straw
buyer's
name
or
the
--
or
the
other
person's
name
or
both.
you
don't
know
where
the
gun
is
going
to
end
up,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
made
that
up.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
some
cases
they
can
track
it
all
the
way.
in
this
case,
unlike
the
hypothetical
that
justice
alito
gave
you,
if
they
went
to
the
straw,
to
the
straw
purchaser,
he
would
say:
oh,
i
actually
bought
it
from
my
uncle.
and
he'd
give
the
uncle's
name,
and
then
the
uncle
would
say,
you
know,
where
else
the
firearm
went
from
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
government's
--
i
guess
i
should
ask
the
government,
but
does
the
government
contend
that
there
are
two
buyers
now?
both
--
is
the
real
buyer
the
person
who
sends
in
the
straw
man
so
that
it's
only
his
information
that
you
have
to
give?
or
are
there
two
buyers?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
--
could
you
address
the
other
--
the
other
point
here,
which
is
the
one
i
have
more
trouble
with,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
count
2?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
lie
in
--
in
answering
questions
that
the
government
has
no
technical
right
to
answer?
i
mean,
let's
assume
i
agree
with
you
that,
in
fact,
this
information
was
--
the
government
was
not
authorized
to
obtain
this
information,
and
therefore,
it
was
not
required
to
be
kept.
but
nonetheless
they
asked
it,
and
your
client
didn't
just
say,
i
won't
answer.
he
lied.
now,
can
you
--
can
you
lie,
so
long
as
the
question
is
improper?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
to
the
first,
are
there
two
buyers
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
does
--
what
does
the
person
who's
buying
for
somebody
else
--
he
has
to
provide
both
names
or
just
the
name
of
the
real
buyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
both
of
them
had
to
take
possession,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
person
who
paid
took
possession,
was
authorized
to
take
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
are
two
buyers
and
both
of
them
have
to
be
on
the
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
you
saying
the
real
buyer
is
the
person
who
put
up
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
its
current
one.
it
used
to
have
a
different
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
any
more
horrible
than
the
notion
that
as
soon
as
i
buy
it
i
walk
out
of
the
store
and
i
meet
this
guy
in
the
parking
lot,
he
says:
hey,
that's
a
nifty
looking
gun
there.
how
much
did
you
pay
for
it?
he
says:
you
know,
i
paid
600
dollars.
i'll
give
you
700.
oh,
it's
yours.
right?
i
can
hand
it
to
him,
can't
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
notion
that
the
gun
would
somehow
get
into
the
hands
of
somebody
who,
you
know,
who
wasn't
registered
or
who
couldn't
buy
it
himself,
that's
going
to
happen
any
way.
what
you
assert
does
not
stop
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
think
of
prosecuting
him,
would
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
got
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
al
capone
hypothetical.
as
i
understand
petitioner's
case
here,
i
don't
think
he's
asserting
that
if
al
capone,
if
--
if
he
intended
to
transfer
it
to
al
capone,
that
his
statement
would
not
have
been
material.
his
position
is,
since
i
intended
to
transfer
it
to
somebody
who
could
lawfully
possess
it,
the
statement
was
immaterial.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
on
the
appendix
to
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
look
at
all
these
things
because
they
are
not
in
your
brief.
i
really
--
i
really
resent,
especially
in
statutory
cases,
not
having
the
statute
in
front
of
us.
i
shouldn't
have
to
flip
through
your
--
your
brief
to
see
what
page
you
cite
a
little
snippet
from
one
section
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
and
--
and
you're
saying
that
when
--
when
i
buy
it
and
i
told
somebody
i'll
sell
it
to
you
later,
that
i
am
acting
as
an
agent?
wow.
it's
a
criminal
statute.
