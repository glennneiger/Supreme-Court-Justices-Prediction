justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
a
unitary
contract?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
clement,
you're
making
--
you're
making
an
assumption.
the
claim
here
is
not
whether
he
abused
or
didn't
abuse
the
program.
his
allegation
is
that
the
only
reason
you
terminated
with
a
contract
was
because
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
these
high
flyers
in
your
merger
negotiations
with
the
other
airline.
that's
the
same
as
saying
they
didn't
terminate
me
because
i
abused
the
program.
they
terminated
me
because
i
was
of
a
certain
race
or
i
was
a
woman
or
i
was
handicapped
or
some
other
improper
consideration.
so
are
you
suggesting
that
this
contract
permits
you
to
use
that
kind
of
self
--
that
kind
of
ground,
one
not
grounded
in
the
contract,
but
grounded
in
your
whim
and
caprice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
you
have
absolute
discretion,
isn't
there
a
limit
to
that?
isn't
there
a
limit
of
reasonableness
to
that
absolute
discretion?
that's
the
whole
question
of
--
otherwise,
you
have
a
contract
with
no
substance.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
give
you
--
i'm
quoting
the
minnesota--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
let's
go
back
to
a
simpler
standard.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
simpler
standard
comes
from
quoting
hennepin:
"does
the
implied
covenant
claim
extend
to
actions
beyond
the
scope
of
the
underlying
contract,
or
can
it
override
the
express
terms
of
an
agreement?
"
"if
the
answer
is
no,
it's
not
preempted.
"
is
that
an
okay
statement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
that's
what
minnesota
law
says,
it's
okay
and
it's
not
preempted.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
the
lack
of
good
faith
that
you
are
claiming?
that
they
thought
he
was
abusive,
or
are
you
saying
--
what
are
you
saying
was
the
bad
faith,
what
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can't
be
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
there
has
to
be
--
what
are
you
saying
was
the
bad
cause
here?
assume
their
answer,
that
he
was
abusing
the
program.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you
are
doing
exactly
what
he
is
saying.
you
are
saying
that
their
judgment
of
abuse
is
not
enough.
