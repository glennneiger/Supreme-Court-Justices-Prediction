chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-462,
northwest,
incorporated
v.
rabbi
ginsberg.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
you
tell
me
where
you
think
they
concede
that
some
states
--
that
their
position
would
lead
to
a
different
result
in
some
states?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
they
were
saying
that
in
some
states
it's
not
an
implied
term
of
the
contract,
but
a
different
sort
of
provision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yelin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
had
a
decision
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
on
common
law
contract
principles
and
it
said,
you
know,
when
the
parties
use
the
word
‶
sole
″
in
a
contract,
we
interpret
that
to
mean
subject
to
reasonableness
constraint.
the
parties
here
use
the
word
‶
sole
″.
would
the
application
of
that
principle
violate
--
would
that
be
preempted
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
‶
reasonable
″
means
--
i
mean,
you
know,
the
--
the
airline
says
‶
sole
″
means
sole.
we
don't
have
to
explain
why
we
did
it.
and
the
minnesota
court
said:
no,
when
you
say
‶
sole
″
it
has
to
be
reasonable.
it
can't
be,
for
example,
for
no
reason.
it
has
to
be
for
some
articulated
reason.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say
going
forward.
going
forward,
the
parties
know
that
this
decision
is
out
there
and
they
say
‶
sole
″.
so
it
means
they're
using
the
term
subject
to
the
gloss
that's
been
put
on
it
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
so
what
about
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
would
assume
then
that
the
parties
knew
whenever
they
used
the
word
‶
sole
″,
they
actually
meant
subject
to
reasonableness
as
interpreted
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
not
going
to
give
me
‶
reasonable
″
for
anything?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you're
going
to
give
me
‶
reasonable
″
--
in
other
words,
the
parties'
express
terms
do
not
say
‶
reasonable
″;
in
fact,
the
most
natural
reading
is
that
it's
not
reasonable,
but
they
take
the
contractual
--
the
interpretation
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
adopted,
i
don't
know
why
the
same
rule
wouldn't
apply
when
the
minnesota
supreme
court
says
there
is
an
implied
condition
of
reasonableness
across
--
across
the
board,
and
that
the
parties
contract
against
that
background
just
like
they
do
when
there's
a
specific
interpretation
of
the
word
‶
sole
″.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
do
agree,
it
seems
pretty
inconsistent
with
the
normal
presumption
against
preemption
that
we
apply
out
of
respect
for
the
state
legal
regimes
to
say
we're
going
to
adopt
a
broad
prophylactic
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
no
clearer
than
the
--
the
government's
view,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
particular
problem
when
you're
talking
about
the
objectives
of
the
ada
to
say
that
the
rule
varies
from
state
to
state.
particularly
since,
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
airlines
that
go
to
a
lot
of
different
states.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
loosest
state
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
preemption
is
going
to
set
the
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
it's
a
general
rule
that
it
depends
upon
the
particular
circumstances.
that's
the
same
rule,
but
in
its
application,
it
certainly
varies
from
state
to
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
helps
your
argument
to
say
that
your
position
promotes
the
purposes
of
the
ada,
because
the
whole
point
of
that,
of
the
preemption
provision,
is
that's
for
the
federal
government
to
determine,
not
for
different
state
laws,
what
promotes
the
purposes
of
the
ada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
three
minutes,
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
