mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
wolens,
this
court
recognized
that
congress
enacted
the
ada
to
leave
decisions
concerning
airline
prices,
routes,
and
services
to
the
business
judgment
of
air
carriers
subject
to
market
forces
and
limited
oversight
by
the
department
of
transportation.
in
light
of
that
statutory
purpose,
wolens
held
that
claims
based
on
the
state
common
law
of
contract
are
not
preempted
by
the
ada
to
the
extent
they
seek
to
enforce
the
voluntary
undertakings
of
the
parties.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
in
that
context,
i
think
not.
it
depends
on
what
the
court
meant
by
the
term
‶
reasonable
″.
if
the
term
‶
reasonable
″
incorporates
external
standards
such
as
community--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--yes,
i
understand,
chief
justice,
thank
you.
but
i
think
‶
reasonable
″
can
have
different
focuses.
it
could
be
reasonable
in
light
of
the
expectations
of
the
parties
at
the
time
that
they
formed
the
contract
or
it
could
be
reasonable
in
light
of
community
standards
of
decency,
which
are--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--i
think
subsequent,
if
there
is
a
gloss
where
--
and
the
--
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
of
what
the
parties
intended
with
the
contract,
and
i
think
there
may
well
be
an
argument
under
that
scenario
that
the
airline
understood
that
the
gloss
was
going
to
be
given,
although
i--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--i
think
that
may
well
be
right,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
want
to
caution
that
an
argument
like
that
can
prove
too
much.
an
argument
like
that
could
suggest,
as
respondent
argued
in
the
lower
court,
that
any
time
a
party
enters
into
a
contract,
the
party
endorses
or
at
least
accepts
all
normative
principles
of
contract
law.
that
would
include
things
like
doctrines
of
unconscionability
and
other
doctrines
that
impose
extracontractual
limitations
on
the
parties'
choices.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
no,
no.
i
absolutely
am
going
to
give
you
‶
reasonable
″.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
i
think
it
just--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--i
think
the
problem,
chief
justice,
is
that
the
notion
of
the
doctrine
of
the
implied
covenant
is
extraordinarily
broad
and
encompasses
a
number
of
different
concepts.
it
encompasses
notions
of
reasonableness
and
implying
limitations
to
discretionary
grants
of
authority
reserved
in
contracts.
it
also
encompasses
in
some
states
concepts
such
as
notions
of
fairness
or
which
extend
beyond
the
intent
of
the
parties.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
i
think
the
ada
would
preempt
exactly
that
sort
of
claim
or
a
claim
based
on
that
sort
of
an
argument.
the
--
the
crux
of
the
ada
is
to
leave
to
the
judgment
of
air
carriers,
subject
to
market
forces,
decisions
concerning
rates,
routes
or
services.
and
i'd
like
to
underscore
this
point
by
pointing
out
that
the
interpretation
that
this
court
gives
to
the
ada
is
not
only
going
to
control
frequent
flyer
programs;
it's
also
going
to
control
things
like
contracts
of
carriage,
which
are--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--justice
breyer,
i
heartily
endorse
each
of
the
four
criteria
you
identified.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
and
i
think
the
standard
that
this
court
could
adopt
and
make
very
clear
is
that
any
contract
doctrine
which
seeks
to
interpret
the
intent
of
the
parties
at
the
time
of
the
contract's
formation
is
a
valid
standard
to
be
applied
in
any
suit
and
is
not
preempted
by
the
ada.
but
any
contract
doctrine
like
unconscionability
and
like
in
some
states
some
instances
of
the
doctrine
of
the
implied
covenant,
which
seeks
to
impose
extracontractual
terms
like
community
standards--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there's
a
continuum.
the
--
the
notion
of
the
implied
covenant,
as
justice
scalia
explained
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
tymshare
decision,
is
a
label
with
many
--
that
encompasses
many
meanings.
some
states,
like
illinois
and
connecticut,
use
the
doctrine
purely,
it
appears
to
us,
as
an
interpretive
device
to
discern
the
intent
of
the
parties.
other
states
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
--
arizona
is
one;
we've
cited
a
number
of
other
cases
in
our
brief
--
used
the
same
concept
to
encompass
extracontractual
principles.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
justice
scalia,
i
have
two
responses
to
that
observation.
the
first
is
i
don't
think
the
state-by-state
analysis
is
either
unusual
or
difficult.
there
has
to
be
a
state-by-state
analysis
any
time
you
--
you
have
a
contract
claim
applying
state
law.
there
are
variances
among
states
in
their
contract
law.
the
--
the
second
part
of
the
same
response
is,
i
don't
think
the
standard
that
we're
articulating
is
a
particularly
different
one.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
not
at
all
a
difficult
question.
i
think
a
contract
--
i
think
it's
unlikely
that
a
frequent
flyer
contract
or
any
airline
contract
that
reserves
discretion
is
likely
to
have
incorporated
implicitly
community
standards.
i
think
the
point
would
be
that
if
a
carrier
were
to
decide
to
--
to
incorporate
ineffable
standards
such
as
that,
it
would
have
been
pretty
clear
in
any
reservation--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--i
--
i
have
one
principal
response,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
this.
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
a
prophylactic
rule
along
the
lines
that
petitioner
was
suggesting,
we
think
that
would
be
better
than
an
alternative
prophylactic
rule
in
the
other
direction,
because
it
would
cut
off
the
use
of
the
implied
covenant
doctrine
that
would
impose
extracontractual
limitations.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
this
--
this
is,
in
part,
precisely
why
we
propose
that
the
court
look
--
adopt
a
standard,
which
we
don't
think
would
be
particularly--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--that
is
an
okay
statement.
we--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--with
the
following
caveat,
justice
sotomayor.
in
some
states
that
have
adopted
the
implied
covenant,
they
have
hybrid
approaches
where
they
not
only
look
to
the
intent
of
the
parties,
but
also
impose
external
standards.
the
standard--
