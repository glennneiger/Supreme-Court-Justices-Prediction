justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
the
case
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
change
the
hypothetical
slightly.
suppose
the
contract
says
that
one
of
the
parties
reserves
sole
discretion
to
do
something
and
then
the
contract
goes
on
to
say:
and
then
in
exercising
this
discretion,
we
don't
promise
to
act
in
a
reasonable
manner.
but
the
state
court
says
that,
nevertheless,
that
has
to
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
party
can
only
perform
in
a
reasonable
manner.
then
what
would
the
situation
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
you
have
in
minnesota
or
one
of
the
states
where
you
say
the
covenant
is
simply
a
way
of
effectuating
the
intent
of
the
parties,
you
have
a
contract
between
two
very
tough
and
nasty
businessmen.
and
they
write
right
in
their
contract,
you
know,
we're
going
to
comply
with
the
literal
terms
of
this
contract,
but
we
do
not
promise
each
other
that
we're
going
to
proceed
in
good
faith
or
that
we
are
going
to
deal
with
each
other
fairly.
we
are
going
to
take
every
advantage
we
can
under
the
literal
terms
of
the
contract.
now,
would
that
get
rid
of
the
covenant
under
minnesota
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
in
many
states
the
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
is
read
into
most
contracts,
but
is
not
read
into
employment
contracts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
discrepancy
show
simply
that
the
state
has
different
policies
with
respect
to
those
two
types
of
contracts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
an
at-will
employment
contract
is
a
contract
that
gives
the
employer
sole
discretion
as
to
whether
to
retain
an
employee.
and
here
we
have
a
contract
that
says
that
the
airline
has
sole
discretion
to
determine
whether
to
terminate
somebody
from
the
frequent
flyer
program.
so
what
is
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
something
slightly
different?
an
amicus
brief
submitted
in
support
of
your
position
by
california
and
some
other
states
points
out
at
some
length
that
there
are
now
a
lot
of
frequent
flyer
programs
in
which
a
lot
of
miles
are
earned
by
making
purchases
other
than
for
--
for
flights
and
in
which
miles
can
also
be
spent
for
things
other
than
flights.
do
we
have
to
worry
about
that
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
are
the
facts
relating
to
this
particular
plan?
can
you
earn
miles
by
doing
things
other
than
flying?
can
you
spend
miles
on
things
other
than
flying?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
rebuttal
time,
but
if
the
facts
were
that
under
a
particular
program
90
percent
of
the
miles
were
earned
by
purchasing
things
other
than
flying
and
90
percent
of
the
miles
were
spent
on
things
other
than
flying,
wouldn't
that
be
very
different?
