ms.

h.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
northwest
claims
that
the
world
perks
contract
allowed
it
to
terminate
rabbi
ginsberg's
membership
and
take
away
the
miles
he
had
already
accrued
in
reliance
on
the
frequent
flyer
program
contract;
that
is,
that
it
allowed
it
for
any
reason
or
on
any
whim
to
deprive
him
of
all
of
the
benefits
of
the
frequent
flyer
program
contract
bargain.
our
position,
in
contrast,
is
that
northwest's
actions
breached
its
obligations
under
the
contract,
specifically
the
contractual
obligation
to
perform
in
good
faith.
because
this
is
a
question
of
contract
interpretation,
rabbi
ginsberg's
claim
is
not--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--the
action
was
terminating
him
from
the
program
and
taking
away
his
miles--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--without
possible
cause.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
we
do
not
think
that
he
was
abusing
the
program.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
that--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--we
think
that
there
is
some
--
there
are
some
reasons
that
he
could
not
be
terminated
from
the
program
for,
and
there
are
allegations
in
the
complaint,
that
are
incorporated
into
the
covenant
of
good
faith
claim
in
the
complaint,
that
he
was
terminated
because
of
the
merger
between
delta
and
northwest.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
don't
think
so.
well,
that
he
would
be
out
of
luck--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--we
agree
that
if
it's
not
construing
the
contract,
that
if
a
state--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--were
instead
claiming
that
the
contract
violated
the
law,
instead
of
that
northwest
had
violated
the
contract--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
states
tend,
in
applying
the
covenant
of
good
faith,
to
apply
it
in
--
as
a
contract
interpretation
tool,
as
a
way
of
giving
effect
to
the
benefits
of
the
bargain.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
the
vast
majority
of
states,
and
there
is
an
appendix
to
the
states'
brief
on
this
issue,
talk
about
the
covenant
of
good
faith
as
a
way
of
interpreting
the
contract,
and
minnesota--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--generally,
the
covenant
of
good
faith
cannot
be
waived.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
the
principle
that
the
covenant
can't
be
waived
is
itself
an
external
principle
of
law
is
a
much
harder
question
than
the
question
here
of
whether
the
covenant
itself--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--again,
i
think
you
need
to
separate
out
the
principle
that
it
can't
be
waived
from
the
underlying
principle
of
what
the
covenant
is
doing,
which
is
giving
effect
to
the
bargain
that
the
parties
entered
into
based
on
looking
at
the
reasonable
expression
--
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
the
self-imposed
undertaking,
and
then
this
is
the
tool
that's
being
used
to
understand
and
interpret
the
tools
of
the
--
terms
of
the
contract
and
then
to
enforce
them.
and
this
is
a
widely
used
tool
to
interpret
terms
of
contracts,
particularly
when
there
are
discretionary
terms
within
a
contract.
that's
something
that's
done
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
states,
and
in
fact
the
discretionary
--
the
cases
where
there
are
discretionary
terms
within
a
context
is
the
quintessential
application
of
the
covenant
of
good
faith.
a
lot
of
the
early
covenant
of
good
faith
claims
involved
outputs
or
requirements
contracts
where
the
specific
amount
in
the
contract
was
not
set
and
the
covenant
was
applied
to
that
sort
of
situation.
and
scholars,
in
talking
about
the
covenant,
often
specifically
note
that
it
applies
to
discretionary
terms.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
think
that
that's
a
situation
that
states
struggle
with
given
the
at-will
employment
doctrine
and
they've
viewed
the
covenant
and
the
at-will
employment
doctrine
as
being
in
conflict
with
each
other.
here,
though,
the
covenant
and
the
contract
or
any
other
principle
are
not
in
conflict
with
each
other.
the
covenant
is
not
being
used
to
override
any
terms
in
the
contract.
it
is
being
used
to
help
give
meaning
to
the
terms
in
the
contract
and
to
identify
what
the
implicit
restrictions
are.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it's
applying
different
types
of
policy.
i
think
it's
interpreting
the
contract
and
what
the
contract
means
differently
in
different
situations.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
exactly.
and
i
do
think
that
courts
will
sometimes
say
the
covenant
doesn't
apply
when
what
they
mean
is
that
if
the
covenant
did
apply
and
the
court
were
looking
at
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties
based
on
the
contract,
there
would
be
no
reasonable
expectations--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
it's
a
difference
in
the
context
and
what
the
term
‶
sole
discretion
″
means
in
different
contexts
is
going
to
vary
based
on
the
context,
and
based
on
what
someone
entering
into
that
contract
reasonably
would
have
expected
that
contract
to
mean
based
on
the
terms
of
the
contract.
so
in
the
employment
context,
an
employee,
given
the
wide
acknowledgment
of
the
at-will
employment
doctrine,
might
not
expect
that
they
could
only
be
terminated
for
cause.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
we
agree
that
that
does
not--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
our
standard
is
very
similar
to
the
one
that
the
united
states
said.
it's
about
whether
the
covenant
is
going
to
--
whether
the
claim
is
looking
at
whether
the
parties
breached
the
contract
or
whether
it's
looking
at
whether
the
contract
itself
violated
the
law.
so
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
claim
is
actually
interpreting
the
contract,
and
trying
to
get
at
what
the
parties
--
what
their
agreement
was,
or
whether
the
claim
is
really
that
the
contract
as
the
parties
agreed
to
it
violated
the
law.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
if
a
state
says
that
it's
imposing
external
notions
of
policy,
that
would
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
drawn
in
wolens,
which
looked
at
enforcing
terms
of
the
agreement
versus
imposing
external
state
policies.
but
that--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
the
claim
was
framed
and
how
the
court
interpreted
that
claim
and
whether
in
interpreting
that
claim,
the
court
was
looking
at
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties
based
on
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
based
on
their
desire
to
be
bound
by
an
enforceable
contract.
or
whether
it
thought
it
was
imposing
--
overriding
the
parties'
contract
and
imposing
external
notions
of
fairness.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
rule
itself
is
varying
from
state
to
state.
i
think
that
the
rule
would
be
the
same
across
states.
that
when
a
claim
is--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
would
because
in
all
the
states,
a
claim
that's
seeking
to
get
at
the
expectations
and
intents
of
the
parties
would
not
be
preempted
where
as
one
imposing
external
notions
of
fairness
would.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
expectations,
subjective
expectations
and
reasonable
expectations.
and
the
concept
of
reasonable
expectations
in
the
complaint
is
--
is
an
objective
standard
of
what
--
based
on
this
contract
and
based
on
the
context,
what
--
how
the
contract
should
be
interpreted
and
what
implicit
terms
there
are
in
the
contract
that
need
to
be
interpreted
and
then
enforced
and
that
can,
in
fact,
be
breached
by
the
other
party.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
think
you
should
apply
the
presumption
against
preemption
of
state
law
because
it
does
apply.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
do
think
the
presumption
applies.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
any
outcome
in
this
case.
because
whether
or
not
it
applies
in
wolens,
this
court
held
that
claims
are
about
holding
airlines
to
the
terms
of
their
agreement
are
not
preempted
and
that's
what
the
covenant
of
good
faith
claim
is
about.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
think
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
uniformity
across
the
states
in
how
they
actually
apply
the
covenant
of
good
faith,
and
in
terms
of
applying
it
as
an
interpretation
of
the
contract,
and
then
especially
in
cases
where
one
party
is
claiming
that
all
of
their
performance
under
the
contract
is
in
their
sole
discretion
and
that
they're
free
not
to
perform
under
the
contract
at
all,
you
know,
essentially
where
the
contract
would
be
illusory
in
applying
the
covenant
specifically
under
those
circumstances
to
ensure
that
there
is
meaningful
performance
that's
required
under
the
contract.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
don't
believe
that's
an
illusory
contract.
but
i
think
rather
than
it
being
important
whether
there
are
specific
require
--
whether
specifically
this
contract
is
illusory,
i
think
the
fact
that
one
party
is
claiming
that
it
had
no
duty
to
perform
under
the
contract
shows
that
the
contract
had
reasonable
implicit
limitations
in
it.
that
the
parties
would
have
reasonably
expected
that
they
were
contracting
to
there
being
some
sort
of
performance
under
the
contract.
and,
in
fact,
the
principles
at
issue
here
are
remarkably
similar
to
the
principles
that
were
at
issue
in
wolens
itself.
and
this
court
there
recognized
that
those
were
contract
construction
issues.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
in
wolens,
the
question
was
an
express
reservation
of
rights
and
the
contract
didn't
say
whether
or
not
it
applied
retroactively.
so
the
question
was
whether
there
were
implied
limitations
on
the
express
reservation
of
rights.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
might
be
different,
but
the
reasonable
expectations--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
there
may
be
a
larger
amount
of
deference
that's
given
to
the
airline
in
that
a
party
would
reasonably
expect
would
be
given
to
the
airline
because
of
the
sole
discretion
language.
and
that's
obviously
a
question
for
the
merits,
what
exactly
is
the
meaning
of
the
sole
discretion
language.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
think
question
is
less
state-by-state
and
really
more
case-by-case
and
context-by-context
of
what
does
sole
discretion
language
mean
when
used
--
and
where
do
you
apply
limitations
on
it.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
don't
think
that
there
would
necessarily
be
the
same
outcome
in
every
single
situation,
whether
or
not
the
claim
--
whether
or
not
the
contract
said
‶
sole
discretion
″
or
not.
there
may
be
more
deference
given
to
the
airline
because
of
the
discretionary
term;
but
in
both
situations,
the
question
would
be,
what
does
this
contract
mean?
and
contracts
include
both
their
express
terms
and
their
implied
terms
and
the
covenant
of
good
faith
is
going
to
interpreting
implied
terms,
to
identifying
them
within
the
contract
and
then
enforcing
them
within
the
contract.
if
an
airline
were
able
to
just
insert
‶
sole
discretion
″
or
‶
sole
judgement
″
within
its
contract,
it
would
be
able
to
entirely
circumvent
the
rule
that
this
court
set
forth
in
wolens.
just
by
adding
‶
sole
discretion
″
to
its
contract,
it
would
never
be
held
to
any
contractual
duties
or
requirements.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
we
think
that
that's
another
reason
why
this
claim
is
not
preempted,
is
because
it
has
to
do
with
membership
in
a
frequent
flyer
program,
rather
than
being
--
rather
than,
like
in
wolens,
having
to
do
specifically
with
access
to
flights
or--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--there
are
not
very
many
facts
in
the
record
about
the
plan,
but
the
contract
does
refer
to
airline
miles
--
sorry,
to
airline
partners
from
whom
one
could
earn
miles
and
then
use
miles
also.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
delta,
which
is
merged
into--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--he
did,
yes.
and
that
is
something
in
the
record.
but--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--this
is
a
claim
just
about
his
membership
in
the
program
overall,
and
that
is
a
membership
where
people
who
have
the
same
claim
as
him
could
be
earning
miles
on
their
credit
card,
spending
miles
on
hotel
rooms.
and
once
there
is
a
claim
where
someone
can
bring
it
who
has
no
relationship
with
air
travel
whatsoever,
where
they
can
bring
the
exact
same
claim,
it's
hard
to
see
how
that
claim
is
related
to
prices,
routes,
or
services
of
air
travel.
and
there's
certainly
been
no
showing
here
that--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--no,
i'm
saying
that
someone--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--or
the
person
who
used
their
credit
card
to
receive
frequent
flyer
miles.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
and
then
also
use
them
for
purposes
other
than
airline
transportation.
reportedly,
more
miles
are
earned
now
on
the
ground
than
on
flight,
through
means
other
than
travel
than
actually
through--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--he,
himself--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--no,
there
isn't.
he,
rabbi
ginsberg
himself,
earned
and
used
his
miles--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
his
claim--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--his
claim
is
about
his
membership
in
the
program
itself.
and
the
program
itself
can
be
used,
including
the
accrued
miles
that
are
earned
under
the
program,
can
be
used
for
purposes
besides
airline
flights.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
no.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
it
does
not
specifically
say,
but
the
contract
does
refer
to
the
airline
partners
and
this
was
decided--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--no,
i
think
airline
partners
can
be
the
people
with
whom
they
partner
with,
to
whom
they
sell
their
miles.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
this
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
so
all
there
is,
is
the
complaint,
but
there
is--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--the
complaint
does
include
the
contract,
that
does
refer
to
the
partners,
but
does
not,
i
don't
think,
define
exactly
who
the
partners
are.
but
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
claim
relates
to
prices,
routes,
and
services,
because
it
can
decide
this
case
based
on
the
line
drawn
in
wolens
of
whether
or
not
this
claim
enforces
the
terms
of
the
--
enforces
the
terms
of
the
contract,
which
under
minnesota
law
the
covenant
of
good
faith
does.
cases
in
minnesota
have
referred
to
this
as
a
breach
of
contract
claim.
and
i
want
to
respond
to
justice--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
there
are
separate
regulations
that
apply
to
safety
under
the
ada,
so
--
and
separate
preemption
doctrines
that
apply
to
safety
under
the
ada.
but
besides
that,
this
would
apply
to
matters
besides
--
to
matters
besides
frequent
flyer
miles
and
other
sole
discretion,
issues
in
which
the
contract
leaves
an
issue
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
airline.
i
do
want
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
whether
someone
can
go
to
the
department
of
transportation.
the
department
of
transportation
does
have
authority
over
unfair
and
deceptive
practices
by
airlines,
but
this
is
--
that's
very
different
than
the
claim
that
we're
pursuing
here.
that's
a
claim
by
an
airline
--
sorry,
by
the
government,
that
doesn't
give
remedies
to
the
specific
consumer
who
was
hurt.
and
that
also
looks
at
whether
the
practice
is
unfair
or
deceptive.
and
our
claim
here
isn't
that
this
was
an
unfair
practice.
the
claim
here
is
that
this
is
a
practice
or
these
were
actions
that
violated
the
contract
and
what's
being
applied
here
are
contract
law
principles
about
interpreting
the
covenant
of
good
faith.
and
the
same
thing
was
true
also
in
wolens.
at
the
time
of
wolens,
the
department
of
transportation
had
the
same
ability
to
pursue
claims
for
unfair
or
deceptive
practices,
but
the
court
recognized
that
that
did
not
override
the
need
for
there
to
be
a
contract
dispute
resolution
regime
by
the
state
courts.
and
that's
the
same
--
the
same
is
true
here
whether
or
not
the
contract
term
at
issue
is
expressed
or
implied.
and
overall,
like
in
wolens,
this
is
claim
where
if
these
sort
of
claims
were
preempted
it
would
undercut
the
efficiency
of
contracts
and
the
competitive
marketplace
that
overall
the
ada
is
meant
to
pursue.
people

they
need
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
other
party
to
their
contract
will
interpret
that
contract
in
good
faith
according
to
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties
where
they
will
give
them
the
performance
they
reasonably
thought
that
they
were
securing
when
they
entered
into
the
contract.
under
northwest's
position
here,
though,
that
it
has
the
discretion
not
to
perform
at
all,
people
won't
be
able
to
rely
on
the
security
of
their
contracts.
and
it's
hard
to
imagine
that
when
congress
enacted
the
airline
deregulation
act
it
meant
to
undercut
the
efficiency
of
contracts
in
that
way.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
one
thing
this
court
said
in
wolens
was
that
having
--
being
able
--
for
people
to
be
able
to
trust
their
contracts
was
something
that
promoted
the
purposes
of
the
ada.
and
we
think
that
is
true
whether
the
terms
that
are
being
relied
on
are
expressed
terms
of
contracts
or,
like
here,
the
implicit
understood
terms
of
the
contract
that
the
contract
is
going
to
be
performed
in
good
faith.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
thank
you.
