i
guess
i
don't
understand
that,
mr.
clement,
because
i
always
thought
that
the
way
these
agreements
worked
were
there
were
agreements
that
if
i
flew
a
certain
number
of
miles
on
your
plan,
i
was
going
to
get
a
free
ticket.
and
--
and
it
wasn't
a
gift
that
i
was
getting
a
free
ticket,
it
was
because
i
did
something,
i
flew
a
certain
number
of
miles.
so
that
there
was
an
exchange
with
value
on
both
sides.
justice
elena
kagan
i
just
don't
see
why
that
would
make
sense.
because
if
i
knew
that
it
was
really
up
to
you
to
give
me
the
free
ticket,
maybe
i
was
willing
to
get
it
and
maybe
i
wasn't.
i
don't
think
that
i'd
be
spending
all
this
time
in
the
air
on
your
planes.
you
know,
i'd
find
another
company
that
actually
gave
me
the
free
ticket.
justice
elena
kagan
but
usually
what
we
say
when
a
contract
has
no
consideration,
we
don't
say,
oh,
we're
going
to
hold
you
to
it
anyway
because
the
market
will
solve
it.
we
say
the
contract
has
no
consideration,
it's
illusory,
in
just
the
way
that
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out.
and
the
question
is:
if
there's
really
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
airline
here
to
give
that
free
ticket,
if
they
can
do
it
when
they
feel
like
it
and
not
do
it
when
they
don't
feel
like
it,
why
is
there
any
consideration?
why
isn't
the
contract
not
illusory?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
clement,
suppose
that
this
complaint
only
had
one
count.
and
suppose
that
they
had
said:
look,
we
have
this
contract
and
it
gives
very
substantial
discretion,
it
gives
--
you
know,
by
the
words
alone,
it
gives
absolute
discretion
to
northwest,
but
that
can't
really
be
right
because
contracts
have
this
implied
covenant
of
good
faith.
there's
an
implied
duty
to
perform
in
good
faith.
and
that
means
that
this
discretion
is
narrowed
in
certain
kinds
of
ways,
that
they
can't
terminate
my
membership
for
certain
kinds
of
reasons.
and
that's
all
the
complaint
said.
there
was
just
this
one
count.
do
you
think
that
would
be
preempted?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
implied
covenant
here,
it's
just
an
interpretive
tool.
it
says
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
provisions
that
are
written
very
broadly
or
very
vaguely,
and
an
implied
covenant
comes
in
to
help
us
interpret
those
kinds
of
provisions.
and
viewed
in
that
way,
it's
just
a
contractual
device
that
in
light
of
wolens
ought
to
be
permitted.
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
it
can't
be
waived,
it
sure
seems
as
though
it
is
operating
independently
of
the
parties'
reasonable
expectations.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
it
might
be,
right,
because
people
have
different
expectations
in
those
two
different
situations,
and
that
the
at-will
employment
is
so
pervasive
and
so
customary
and
so
sweeping
that
the
policy,
the
rule
of
an
implied
covenant
of
good
faith
doesn't
apply
there
because
we
think
everybody
expects
it
not
to
apply
there.
justice
elena
kagan
that
would
be
weird,
isn't
it,
because
in
such
a
state,
there
might
be
a
contract
where
the
parties
reasonably
did
expect
this
implicit
term
that
limits
something,
a
very
broad
conferral
of
discretion
to
operate.
and
yet,
just
because
this
state
supreme
court
has
framed
its
argument
in
a
particular
kind
of
way,
they
don't
get
the
benefit
of
that.
