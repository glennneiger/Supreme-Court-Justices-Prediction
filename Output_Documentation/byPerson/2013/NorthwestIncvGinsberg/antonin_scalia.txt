justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
think
you
have
to
conceive
of
it
that
way,
but
that
still
makes
it
a
unilateral
contract.
it's
not
a
promise
in
exchange
for
another
promise.
it's
a
promise
in
exchange
for
the
performance
of
an
act;
that
is,
flying
the
airline,
you
know,
a
certain
number
of
miles.
you're
correct,
it
is
a
--
a
unilateral
contract.
now,
whether
that
--
that
means
that
there's
no
--
is
there
no
such
thing
as
an
illusory
unilateral
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
trying
to
enforce
the
contract
anyway.
you
--
you
want
to
get
out
of
the
contract.
so
you
--
you
ought
to
be
happy
to
have
it
pronounced
an
illusory
contract,
right?
what
do
you
care?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
entirely
--
i
mean,
suppose
the
contract
said
"in
its
absolute
discretion
and
subject
to
no
obligation
of
good
faith.
"
suppose
it
said
that.
would
state
law
still
impose
an
obligation
of
good
faith?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
might
well
or
it
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
state.
i
mean,
the
state
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
it
is
assumed
that
parties
to
a
contract
comport
with
community
standards
of
fairness
and
decency.
you
know,
you
can
wiggle
to
there
if
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
have
to
sort
those
out
state
by
state.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
--
the
regime
proposed
by
the
petitioner
is
--
is
much
more
manageable.
if
it
goes
beyond
the
words
of
the
contract,
it
--
and
you're
reading
into
it
something
that
it
doesn't
say,
it's
a
matter
of
state
policy.
so
i
can
--
i
can
work
with
that.
but
you're
--
you're
asking
me
to
go
through
each
of
the
50
states
one
by
one
to
decide,
oh,
which
--
which
of
these
are
really
trying
to
discern
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
which
ones
aren't.
especially
since
you
discern
the
intent
of
the
parties
by
simply
saying,
well,
parties
intend
to
apply
community
standards,
right?
and
there'll
be
different
community
standards
in
every
state
presumably.
some
states
are
more
honest
than
others,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
variances,
but
not
variances
in
such
an
ineffable
question
as
to
whether
this
is
really
an
effort
to
discern
the
real
intent
of
the
parties
or
rather,
whether
it's
an
intent
to
impose
community
standards,
especially
since,
as
i
say,
parties
intend
to
adopt
community
standards
usually.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
your
argument
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
he
could
be
terminated
without
reasonable
cause
if
he
happened
to
be
from
a
state
or
if
the
suit
was
brought
under
the
governing
law
of
a
state
which
imposed
this
obligation
of
good
faith
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
state
says:
regardless
of
what
the
contract
says,
even
if
it
says
in
its
sole
discretion
without
any
obligation
of
good
faith,
even
if
it
says
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
is
an
obligation
of
good
faith.
as
i
understand
your
case,
you
acknowledge
that
in
that
state
he
would
simply
be
out
of
luck.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
have
no
cause
of
action,
because
this
is
obviously
not
an
interpretation
of
the
contract;
it
is
an
imposition
of
a
state
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wow,
somebody's
really
been
given
a
raw
deal.
you
know,
that's
still
going
to
be
possible
even
if
we
rule
for
you
here.
it
depends
on
what
state
he's
from,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
do,
some
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
rosenbaum,
in
--
in
our
decision
in
this
case,
do
you
think
we
should
apply
the
presumption
against
preemption
of
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
whole
purpose
of
the
ada
was
to
preempt
state
laws.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
applying
that
presumption
to
other
statutes
which
say
nothing
about
preemption.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
ada
was
to
deregulate
airlines,
was
to
say
there
was
going
to
be
no
federal
regulation.
let
the
free
market
handle
it
and
there
be
will
be
no
state
regulation.
and
you
want
us
to
apply
a
presumption
against
preemption
to
that
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
this
contract
produce
a
different
result
if
it
did
not
contain
the
words
‶
in
its
sole
discretion
″?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
--
you'd
--
you'd
still
apply
the
very
same
doctrine
of
reasonableness,
right?
so
the
words
‶
in
its
sole
discretion
″
become
superfluous.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
guess
different
states
will
treat
that
differently
as
well,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
you're
doing
nothing
but
interpreting
a
contract
when
you
--
you
give
it
the
same
outcome,
whether
it
says
in
its
sole
discretion
or
does
not
say
in
its
sole
discretion.
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
grasp
how
what
you're
doing
in
that
--
in
that
case
is
simply
interpreting
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
--
it
relates
to
prices.
even
if
you
get
credit
for
miles
from
staying
in
certain
hotels,
it
still
has
the
effect
of
lowering
the
price
for
your
airline
ticket.
and
likewise,
if
you
can
use
your
frequent
flyer
miles
to
get
cheaper
hotel
rooms,
that
effectively
lowers
the
price
of
your
airline
ticket,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
difference
whether
the
only
thing
you
get
from
the
frequent
flyer
mileage
is,
you
know,
is
airfares
or
other
goodies.
they
are
all
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
you
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
you
can
assign
your
mileage
to
somebody
else
who
can
get
the
hotel
room?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
who
gets
the
discount
for
the
hotel
room
is
the
person
who
bought
the
airline
ticket,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
say
would
apply
to
other
contractual
obligations
of
the
airlines,
right?
so
if
the
airline
says
you
have
to
get
off
the
plane
if
the
flight
attendant
tells
you
to
do
so,
there
is
going
to
be
a
good
faith
obligation
attached
to
that,
so
you
can
challenge,
challenge
those
decisions
in
court?
