justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
all
right.
but
now
the
question
i
have,
which
is,
i
think,
for
anyone
who
wants
to
answer
it,
particularly
the
government.
i
absolutely
agree
with
you
that
--
that
a
free
market
in
price
is
at
the
heart
of
the
deregulation
act.
given.
i
also
think
frequent
flyer
programs
are
simply
price
discounts.
i
also
think
that
if
you
don't
have
contracts,
you
can't
have
free
markets.
but
i
also
think
the
state
cannot,
under
the
guise
of
contract
law,
regulate
the
prices
of
airlines.
if
you
allow
that,
you're
going
to
have
worse
than
we
ever
had.
it'll
be
50
different
systems,
all
right?
so,
if
i
think
those
four
things,
what
standard
do
i
use
to
separate
when
a
state
is
and
when
it
is
not
using
its
contract
law
to
regulate
prices?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
good.
then
you'll
give
me
the
answer,
because
where
i'm
missing
is
what
the
standard
is.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
would
agree
--
it's
the
same
question
i
asked
the
government;
i
would
like
your
answer.
i
imagine
that
you
would
agree
that
a
state
says
the
following:
we
read
into
--
like
common
law
courts
used
to
do
all
the
time,
for
a
transportation
company
we
believe
the
price
must
be
fair
and
reasonable,
and
a
contract
in
our
state
for
transportation
prices
has
to
set
a
fair
and
reasonable
price
and
i
personally
think
many
fares
are
not
reasonable.
they
are
too
high.
all
right.
and
therefore
we
have
substituted
the
judges
and
the
states
for
setting
prices
instead
of
the
parties.
you
agree
that
would
be
preempted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
so
what
is
your
standard
for
distinguishing
what
is
and
is
not
preempted
where
the
state
uses
its
contract
law
to
imply
a
fair
and
reasonable
term?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
what
your
--
your
complaint
that
i
think
--
paragraph
56,
which
i
think
is
the
key
paragraph
says,
that
the
--
under
the
--
the
law
is,
"the
contract
law
that
you
want
to
enforce
is
even
where
a
party
to
a
contract
is
given
absolute
discretion,
it
must
exercise
that
discretion
in
good
faith
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
other
party
or
parties.
"
now,
that's,
i
think,
what
they're
objecting
to.
because
there,
it
sounds
to
me
like
i
go
in
to,
you
know,
get
a
ticket,
my
reasonable
expectation
is
they're
not
going
to
charge
me
what
they're
going
to
charge,
you
know.
i
mean,
it's
unbelievable.
but
there
--
but,
you
see,
that's
my
reasonable
expectation,
and
i'm
the
other
party.
and
so
that
clause
sounds
as
if
you
could,
under
state
contract
law,
govern
the
price
according
to
my
reasonable
expectation,
namely,
the
consumer,
that
might
be
a
great
idea,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
idea
behind
this
act.
that's
what
--
what
--
that's
what
i
just
read
you.
so
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
anything
in
the
complaint
about
anything
other
than
airlines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
in
your
complaint
that
talks
about
anything
other
than
airlines?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know.
but
i
mean,
what
we
are
taking
about
is
what
count
2
of
the
complaint
says.
i
think
that's
their
objection.
but
as
far
as
count
2
of
the
complaint
says,
it's
about
airline
miles,
i
take
it,
and
airline
miles
are
used
on
airlines,
etcetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
there
is
something
else
in
this
complaint,
tell
me
and
i
will
have
to
figure
out
whether
we
go
beyond
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
that
in
the
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
an
airline
partner,
i
take
it,
is
another
airline?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i
want
to
find
out
about
that
in
the
record,
where
do
i
look?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
there
is,
is
the
complaint
and
it
doesn't
talk
about
it
in
the
complaint.
what
i'm
thinking
about,
obviously,
is
we
might
preserve
that
question
for
another
day.
