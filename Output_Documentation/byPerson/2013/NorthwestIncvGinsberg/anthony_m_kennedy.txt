justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
choice
we
have
here
only
between
state
law
and
no
relief?
or
is
there
some
theory
under
which
either
federal
common
law
or
appeal
to
the
dot
could
give
the
flyer,
the
customer,
some
relief?
and,
you
know,
we
can
all
think
of
crazy
hypotheticals.
suppose
the
phone
rings
and
he
says:
i'm
john
doe,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
my
airline,
you've
miscalculated.
they
said:
mr.
doe,
we've
heard
from
you
15
times,
you're
--
you're
out
of
this
program.
it's
a
mistaken
identity.
there
are
two
john
does.
can
the
innocent,
good
faith
john
doe
do
any
--
anything
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
--
in
part
of
that
suit,
wouldn't
you
have
to
--
the
judge
says,
what's
the
underlying
substance
and
you
say,
well,
there's
a
duty
of
good
faith
dealing
under
minnesota
law.
and
then
you're
right
back
where
you
started,
unless
there's
some
--
unless
there's
some
federal
common
law
with
lincoln
mills
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
understand
the
substantive
basis
for
the
breach
of
contract
suit
if
you
say
we
can't
refer
to
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
--
i
still
have
this
problem.
you
say
don't
--
now
don't
worry.
you
can
always
bring
an
express
contract
action.
and
i
say,
well,
what
law
do
you
apply?
well,
you
--
you
have
no
state
law
and
there's
no
federal
common
law.
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
bring
an
action
with
no
substantive
law
to
inform
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
easy
for
you,
representing
the
government.
but
suppose
you
were
representing
the
airline.
would
you
come
up
here
and
say,
the
airlines
want
it
to
be
well
known
that
we
don't
have
to
be
reasonable?
i
--
i
find
that
very
difficult
to
understand.
