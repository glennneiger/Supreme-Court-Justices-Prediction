mr.
clement,
the
argument
was
made
that
if
--
if
the
airline
has
an
unreviewable
right
to
terminate
this
agreement
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason,
if
that
is
so,
then
it's
an
illusory
contract.
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
that,
if
one
party
can
get
out
willy-nilly,
why
--
what
kind
of
bargain
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
minnesota?
in
minnesota,
isn't
it
just
a
rule
of
construction
of
the
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
‶
in
some
states
″.
so
what
about
the
states
where
that
doesn't?
are
you
saying
that
in
some
states,
the
implied
covenant
is
assumed
to
be
what
the
parties
agreed
upon
and
in
some
states
it's
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
state--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
had--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
wolens
--
and
this
is
a
case
that
you
rely
on
and
that
allowed
room
for
contract
claims
--
the
expression
was
‶
self-imposed
undertaking
″.
and
the
airline
says:
we
didn't
impose,
we
didn't
take
on
this
obligation,
but
the
law
reads
it
into
every
contract
whether
we
want
it
or
not.
how
is
it
self-imposed
if
the
party
has
no
say,
that
it's
going
to
apply
anyway?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
had
an
opinion
that
said
we're
going
to
be
candid
about
this.
the
covenant
of
fair
dealing
and
good
faith,
it's
not
in
this
contract,
but
we
will
read
it
into
every
contract.
that
is,
if
the
state
supreme
court
said,
it's
externally
imposed,
this
is
a
rule
that
we
will
read
into
every
contract
because
of
the
policy
in
our
state
that
people
should
deal
with
each
other
fairly.
suppose
that
was
the
controlling
decision
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
then
you're
out;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
one
thing
to
read
the
terms
in
the
agreement.
it's
another
thing
to
say
it's
an
underlying
premise
that
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
will
control.
are
you
taking
issue
with
the
good
faith
and
fair
dealings
standard
being
amorphous,
being
susceptible
to
different
interpretations
by
different
judges,
by
different
juries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
an
employment
at-will
contract
illusory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
because
the
contract
was
silent.
here
it
isn't.
here
the
contract
says
‶
sole
discretion
″.
in
wolens,
the
question
was
retroactivity,
and
the
contract
said
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
plaintiff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
plaintiff
used
the
frequent
flyer
program,
whatever
else
it
might
be
used
for,
he
used
it
to
get
lower
prices
on
flights,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
point
is
that
you
can
get
frequent
flyer
miles
by
purchases
other
than
airplane
transportation.
