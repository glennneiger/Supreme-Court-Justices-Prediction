mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
this
court's
decision
in
wolens,
there
are
only
two
relevant
questions
here,
and
the
ninth
circuit
got
both
of
them
wrong.
the
first
question
is
whether
a
claim
for
additional
benefits
under
a
frequent
flyer
program,
like
flight
upgrades,
relate
to
prices,
routes
and
services.
this
court
answered
that
question
in
the
affirmative
in
wolens
and,
indeed,
underscored
the
questions
not
particularly
close.
the
ninth
circuit's
ability
to
reach
the
contrary
conclusion
in
the
precise
same
context
underscores
how
far
they
have
strayed
from
this
court's
precedence.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
plaintiffs'
claim
here
seek
merely
to
enforce
the
parties'
voluntary
undertakings
or,
rather,
seek
to
enforce
state
law
to
enlarge
those
undertakings
and
enlarge
the
parties'
bargain.
and
it's
to
that
question
2
we
think
respondent's
own
claims
here
make
the
case
quite
clear.
respondent
did
bring
a
claim
here
to
enforce
the
parties'
voluntary
undertakings,
a
breach
of
contract
claim
and
lost
on
the
merits.
the
implied
preemption
claim
is
different.
it
seeks
to
impose
a
duty
of
fair
dealing
and
reasonableness
and
superimposed
that
on
the
bargain,
even
where
the
parties
to
the
contract
have
essentially
given
one
party
absolute
discretion.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
i
think
although
the
focus
on
whether
a
contract
is
illusory
is
sometimes
used
as
part
of
the
analysis
under
the
implied
covenant
for
a
bilateral
contract.
i
don't
think
that
same
analysis
would
apply
to
something
like
a
frequent
flyer
program,
which
i
think
would
be
properly
understood
as
a
unilateral
contract,
where
you
don't
worry
about
those
sort
of
illusory
promises.
the
second
thing
is
i
think
you
have
to
understand
in
the
context--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
--
there
is
a
distinction,
if
you
go
back
to
the
horne
books
on
contract
law
between
a
unilateral
contract
and
a
bilateral
contract.
a
unilateral
contract
is
--
is
a
typical
sort
of
outstanding
promise,
that
promise
doesn't
require
an
exchange
of
consideration,
and
the
party
who
makes
the
promise
has
the
ability
to
withdraw
the
promise
until
there's
--
there's
performance
essentially
relying
on
the
promise.
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
actually
a
little
bit
of
a
mistake
to
apply
that
doctrine
to
something
like
a
frequent
flyer
program.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
--
i
suppose
you
could
conceive
of
it
that
way.
you
could
also
conceive
of
it
as
basically
being
a
premium
that's
offered
by
the
company
to
reward
your
loyalty,
but
you've
already
gotten
full
performance.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
there
really
is.
you
know,
i
looked
at
the
--
the
treatises
for
that,
and
i
just
don't
think
that
concept
really
applies
in
the
unitary
--
the
unilateral
contract
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
really,
i
think,
gets
to
the
nub
of
this,
because,
of
course,
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
there
would
be
a
market
solution
to
this
problem.
and
that's
what
the
airline
deregulation
act
is
all
about.
letting
the
market
decide
these
issues.
so
if
some
airline
really
were
crazy
enough
to
systematically
turn
on
its
most
lucrative
and
loyal
customers,
surely,
the
market
would
solve
that.
and,
of
course,
if
a
bunch
of
airlines
did
it,
the
department
of
transportation
stands
ready
to
police
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
--
there
is
consideration
--
i'm
not
sure
anything
turns
on
this
--
but
there
is
consideration
because
this
is
not
something
where
the
airline
says,
look,
we
can
do
anything
we
want.
they
say,
look,
if
you
present
us
with
miles
while
you're
still
in
good
standing
in
the
program,
we'll
give
you
upgrades,
we'll
let
you
into
a
lounge.
but
if,
pursuant
to
the
contract,
you
abuse
the
program
in
our
sole
discretion,
then
you
lose
your
membership
status.
and
that's
what's
happened
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
that
is
true.
but
i
suppose
the
argument
might
be
that
you
could,
as
a
matter
of
breach
of
contract
law,
use
this
principle
to
interpret
the
contract.
and
if
that
were
an
argument,
it's
an
argument
that's
made
under
count
1
of
this
complaint.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
a
couple
of
points,
justice
sotomayor.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
--
it's
really
important
to
emphasize
that
the
claim
about
pretext
and
this
all
being
about
the
merger
is
actually
not
something
that's
made
in
the
breach
of
contract
count
or
the
breach
of
implied
covenant
count.
that's
pled
actually
in
the
misrepresentation
counts.
counts
3
and
4
of
the
complaint
that
everybody
recognizes
are
preemptive.
now,
what's
pled
in
contract
count
1,
the
breach
of
contract
count,
is
that
under
the
contract,
somehow
we
don't
have
the
ability
to
terminate
somebody
without
just
cause.
and
that's
the
argument
that
the
district
court
rejected
on
the
merits.
now,
the
implied
covenant
count,
count
2,
is
different.
it
says
that
under
state
law,
there
is
a
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
and
that
duty
is
superimposed
on
the
contract
even
if
the
contract
gives
one
of
the
parties
absolute
discretion.
and
those
aren't
my
words.
those
are
the
words
of
count
2
of
the
complaint
at
joint
appendix
page
51.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
way
i
would
think
about
it,
justice
sotomayor,
is
‶
absolute
″
might
not
quite
mean
absolute.
and
the
place
to
make
that
argument
is
under
the
breach
of
contract
rubric.
that
you
can
cite
cardozo
and
lady
duff-gordon.
but
when
you
get
to
saying
even
if
the
contract's
absolute,
state
law
still
superimposes
a
reasonableness
requirement
on
the
contract,
that's
the
point
at
which
preemption
kicks
in.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
might
well,
justice
scalia,
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
depends
on
the
state.
so
the
majority--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay,
minnesota.
i
--
as
i
read
the
cases,
the
rule
in
minnesota
is
that
the
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
is
not
waivable.
so
there's
a
case
that
we
found
called
new
amsterdam
casualty.
it's
in
the
indemnity
context,
so
i
assume
that
--
and
it
says
that
in
the
indemnity
context
a
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
is
not
waivable.
so
i
don't
think
you
could
do
that,
which
i
think
underscores
that
this
is
not
the
parties
agreeing
to
this.
this
is
having
this
condition
superimposed
on
them
by
state
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes.
the
--
the
good
faith
john
doe
can
do
two
things:
one,
as
your
question
suggested,
he
can
go
to
the
dot.
the
dot
has
the
authority
to
investigate
complaints
about
frequent
flyer
programs.
it
exercises
that
authority.
it's
discussed
at
pages,
i
think,
20
and
21
of
the
sg's
brief.
they
heard
something
like
289
of
these
complaints
last
year.
so
that's
--
so
that's
one
place
you
can
go.
the
other
place
you
can
go
in
the
cases
like
the
mistaken
identity
--
i
mean,
if
you
followed
up
and
certainly
if
you
went
so
far
as
to
bring
a
routine
breach
of
contract
claim,
i
assume
that
would
get
addressed
in
that
forum.
because
airlines
are
not
in
the
interest
--
do
not
have
an
interest
in
getting
rid
of
their
most
lucrative
and
loyal
customers.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't
think
there's
federal
common
law.
this
court
i
think
essentially
rejected
that
in
wolens.
i'm
making
a
more
practical
point,
which
is
in
a
real
case
of
mistaken
identity
i
think
that
would
get
sorted
out
in
the
process,
certainly
at
the
point
where
a
breach
of
contract
action
was
brought.
because,
again,
if
there's
--
if
there's
a
john
doe
who
really
is
a
frequent
flyer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
can
refer
to
state
law
for
the
breach
of
contract.
you
can't,
we
would
submit,
add
the
implied
covenant
of
breach
of
good
faith
because
that
enlarges
the
bargain.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
reliance
on
the
implied
covenant
in
that
context
should
be
preempted.
i
think
that's
the
better
rule.
if
this
court
wanted
to
adopt
a
narrower
rule
and
say,
look,
it's
really
at
the
point
that
you
try
to
bring
a
separate
implied
covenant
claim,
that's
preempted,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
adminstrability
you
could
do
that.
it
might
make
some
sense,
because,
i
mean,
you
do
have
to
take
a
practical
look
at
this.
in
the
wake
of
wolens,
if
you
plead
a
routine
breach
of
contract
claim,
you're
going
to
avoid
preemption.
the
only
reason
practically
you
run
the
risk
of
preemption
by
pleading
a
separate
claim
is
when
you're
trying
to
really
get
outside
of
the
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
here's
my
thought
on
that,
which
is
i
think
even
the
respondents
admit
that
in
some
states
the
implied
covenant
is
much
more
than
simply
a
rule
of
construction
for
the
explicit
terms
of
the
contract.
and
i
suppose
if
this
court
wants
to
say
that
the
only
way
the
implied
covenant
is
not
preempted
is
when
it's
just
a
rule
of
construction
for
the
explicit
terms
of
the
contract,
i
suppose
we
could
live
with
that
rule
and
i
think
we'd
certainly
win
in
this
case.
the
reason
i
would
suggest
that
the
better
rule
for
this
court
to
adopt
is
that
the
implied
covenant
should
just
be
preempted
even
in
that
circumstance
is
because
in
that
circumstance
it
doesn't
add
anything.
if
it
really
is
just
a
rule
of
construction
for
the
express
terms
of
the
contract,
you
could
get
in
the
same
place
with
the
citation
to
cardozo
and
lady
duff-gordon.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i'm
not
--
it's
--
it's
in
the
red
brief
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear.
i
think
they
--
they
say
--
i'll
try
to
find
the
--
the
point
where
--
where
i
find
this
rebuttal.
but
i
don't
think
they
do
this.
they
basically
say
that
some
states
do
apply
this
rule.
they
say
that
our
claim
is
different.
and
i'll
get
you
the
exact
page.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
may
have
misspoke.
what
i
meant
was
i
think
both
parties
agree,
as
they
would
have
to,
that
in
some
states
the
implied
covenant
doctrine
is
used
to
directly
impose
public
policy.
and
so
in
alaska
that
seems
to
be
the
case.
in
montana
that
seems
to
be
the
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
tell
you
that
minnesota
law
is
pellucidly
clear
on
this.
but
minnesota
--
the
minnesota
supreme
court
case,
the
hennepin
case
that
adopts
--
recognizes
the
implied
covenant,
cites
the
restatement.
the
restatement
quite
clearly
embraces
a
view
of
the
implied
covenant
that
goes
beyond
merely
constructing
the
express
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
may
have
misspoke,
justice
kennedy.
the
breach
of
contract
claim
that
you
bring
--
the
routine
breach
of
contract
claim
you
bring
is
a
state
law
claim.
so
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
count
1
of
this
claim,
which
views
minnesota
state
contract
law
to
interpret
the
express
terms
of
the
contract.
where
we
have
a
beef
is
with
count
2
of
the
complaint
that
says,
even
if
the
contract
gives
the
parties
absolute
discretion,
we
are
going
to
superimpose
a
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing.
and
to
complete
the
answer,
since
minnesota
has
adopted
the
restatement,
the
restatement
suggests
that
the
way
you
find
good
faith
is
you
exclude
the
possibility
of
bad
faith
based
on
community
standards
of
fairness
and
decency.
and
at
the
point
that
you're
applying
community
standards
of
fairness
and
decency,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
you
are
not
applying
the
parties'
self-imposed
undertakings,
but
something
else.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
could
try
to
wiggle
there.
and
my
point
would
be
the
way
to
try
to
wiggle
there
is
interpreting
the
express
terms
of
the
contract.
an
implied
covenant
is
different.
and
i
think
if
you
take
a
step
back
and
think
about
this
context:
when
an
airline
reserves
to
itself
the
sole
discretion
to
make
a
judgment
about
frequent
flyers
or
about
taking
an
unruly
passenger
off
a
plane,
do
you
really
want
state
courts
applying
community
standards
of
decency
to
judge
that,
or
is
that
something
that
should
be
judged
by
a
complaint
to
the
department
of
transportation?
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
just
a
couple
of
loose
ends.
the
concession
that
i
was
referring
to
before
is
on
page
15
and
16
of
the
red
brief,
i
think
it
was
reiterated
at
the
podium.
also
this
argument
that
somehow
frequent
flyer
miles
programs
have
changed
or
something
and
are
different
because
there
are
partners,
the
same
arguments
were
made
by
the
plaintiffs
in
wolens
in
their
brief
to
this
court
that
somehow
these
don't
relate
to
prices
and
routes
and
services
because
you
have
rental
cars
and
hotels
as
partners.
so
i
think
this
court
has
already
crossed
that
bridge.
three--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
different
in
a
claim
brought
against
the
airlines.
i
mean,
maybe
if
you
want
to
sue
the
credit
card
partner,
the
ada
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
but
i
would
say
that
if
you're
suing
an
airline,
the
airline
deregulation
act
speaks
to
it.
but
if
the
court
want
to
reserve
that,
i
suppose
it
could.
i
do
want
to
make
--
underscore
that
the
implied
covenant
doctrine
is
very
different
from
other
interpretative
tools.
it
is
non-waivable
and,
i
think,
in
a
world
where
you
are
trying
to
determine
the
difference
between
self-imposed
undertakings
and
things
imposed
by
state
law,
non-waivability
is
a
huge
strike
against
it
being
voluntary.
it
also
just
is,
you
can
bring
in
separate
implied
covenant
claims.
you
know,
no
one
--
i've
never
heard
of
a
contra
proferentem
claim,
but
implied
covenant
claim
is
routinely
brought
as
a
separate
claim.
it
just
shows
you
really
can
enlarge
the
bargain
in
very
real
ways,
and
the
states
make
policy
decisions
about
whether
to
have
it.
texas
doesn't
have
implied
covenants
as
a
general
matter
at
all.
some
states
have
a
valid
public
policy.
they
have
different
views
about
at-will
employment
contracts.
and
when
congress
wanted
to
impose
a
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
on
the
franchise
agreements
between
car
manufacturers
and
automobile
dealers,
they
passed
a
statute.
it's
just
statutory
and
policy
oriented
in
a
way
that
normal
rules
of
construction
are
not.
now,
justice
breyer,
i
certainly
agree
with
your
four
premises.
if
i
had
to
state
a
standard,
i
would
say
the
standard
is
that
the
implied
covenant
is
only
not
preempted
when
it
does
no
more
than
provide
a
rule
of
construction
for
the
express
terms
of
the
contract.
but,
of
course,
if
that's
all
it
does,
then
there's
nothing
to
be
gained
by
saying
those
claims
are
not
preempted
because
you
can
still
just
get
to
the
same
place
by
citing
cardozo
and
lady
duff-gordon.
and
there's
a
lot
to
be
gained
by
adopting
a
more
prophylactic
rule
because
the
claims
that
are
brought
in
the
real
world
are
claims
that
i
get
a
refund
even
though
the
ticket's
nonrefundable.
i
get
$1,000
even
though
the
loss
limit
was
500.
i
get
to
sue
you
for
redirecting
my
packages
even
though
it
was
in
your
sole
discretion.
so
in
the
real
world,
the
implied
covenant
claims
are
elastic
and
provide
a
basis
for
bringing
the
kind
of
claims
that
courts
have
almost
uniformly
correctly
recognized
are
preempted.
the
last
question
i
ask
you
to
think
about
is:
why
is
it
the
airlines
don't
put
these
covenants
in
as
express
covenants?
why
do
they
say
sole
discretion
and
not
say
sole
discretion
unless
it
violates
reasonable
norms
of
community
standards
and
decency?
well,
the
reason
is
you
can't
run
a
national,
let
alone
international
airline,
if
every
one
of
your
judgments
about
taking
an
unruly
passenger
off
or
taking
out
an
abusive
customer
is
going
to
be
second-guessed
by
a
jury
applying
reasonable
standards
of
ordinary
decency
and
morality.
so
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
we
would
urge
you
to
apply
a
more
prophylactic
rule.
thank
you.
