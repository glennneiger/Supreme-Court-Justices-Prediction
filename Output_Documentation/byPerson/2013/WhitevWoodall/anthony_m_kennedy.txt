so
would
it
have
been
an
acceptable
and
workable
rule
to
say
that
in
a
sentencing
hearing,
on
any
point
where
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
proof
the
government
is
entitled
to
testimony,
that
silence
can
be
the
basis
for
an
adverse
inference?

--.
i
mean,
you
have
to
either
say
yes
or
not.
if
--
if
you
say
no,
then
i
ask
why
remorse
is
different?
if
you
say
yes,
then
remorse
is
included
within
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
why
you're
not
entitled
to
the
instruction
on
all
issues
as
to
which
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
proof--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
a
sentencing
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
assumption
in
my
question
is
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
certain
number
of
issues
in
the
sentencing
hearing.
as
to
all
of
those
issues,
it
seems
to
me
it
has
to
be
your
position
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
the
instruction
that
i
described.
or
you're
just
going
to
stand
up
and
say,
well,
remorse
is
different.
but
i
--
we
need
to
know
what
--
what
your
argument
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
one
way
of
asking
it,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
still
doesn't
answer
justice
alito's
dilemma.
you
say
he
can't
be
penalized
for
doing
nothing,
but
the
juror
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical
says:
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
when
he
didn't
present
anything,
and
i'm
concerned
about
that?
i
don't
think
you've
answered
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
read
estelle
as
saying
that
on
the
issue
of
remorse,
it
is
an
open
question
whether
or
not
the
self-incrimination
privilege
is
applicable.
suppose
we
read
it
that
way.
and
suppose
we
think
that
in
your
case,
remorse
was
an
issue
at
the
penalty
phase.
does
that
not
mean
that
this
issue
was
not
clearly
decided?
that's
--
it
has
a
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
read
mitchell
as
saying
that
on
the
--
where
remorse
is
at
issue,
it
is
not
settled
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
right;
and
it
is
not
settled
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
about
silence,
number
one.
number
two,
suppose
we
think,
as
i
think
to
be
the
case,
that
remorse
was
an
issue
in
this
trial
in
the
penalty
phase.
does
that
not
mean
that
the
rule
is
unclear
and
you're
not
clearly
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
that
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
--
your
answer
that
is
what
the
law
should
be.
my
question
is
whether
or
not
at
least
the
law
is
not
open
on
that
point,
unsettled.
