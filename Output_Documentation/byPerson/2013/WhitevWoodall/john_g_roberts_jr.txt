chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-794,
white
v.
woodall.
ms.
lenz?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
komp.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
then
the
reservation
certainly
suggests
that
at
the
time
the
instruction
was
requested,
it
wasn't
beyond
any
fair-minded
dispute,
which
is
the
standard.
no
one's
talked
about
the
standard
yet.
the
standard
is
that
--
which
you're
complaining
about
--
that
the
error
has
to
be
so
well
understood
and
comprehended
in
existing
law
to
be
beyond
any
possibility
of
fair-minded
disagreement.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
shortly
after
the
instruction
was
requested
the
court
itself
said,
oh,
that's
different,
we're
not
talking
about
that,
it
certainly
suggests
that
it
was
a
subject
of
fair-minded
disagreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
only
that.
your
position
must
be
that
that
is
so
clear
as
to
be
beyond
fair-minded
disagreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
clear,
objectively
beyond
reasonable
disagreement,
to
say
that
when
the
court
says
lack
of
remorse
in
a
sentencing
guideline
case
it
still
thinks
there's
a
different
rule
for
lack
of
remorse
in
a
selection
case
such
as
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
friend
told
us
that
future
dangerousness
was
an
eligibility
factor
rather
than
a
mere
selection
criteria.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
it
left
in
--
estelle
left
intact
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
your
argument
is
when
mitchell
said
--
whether
it
applies
to
lack
of
remorse
or
acceptance
of
responsibility
for
the
sentencing
guidelines,
that's
a
separate
question.
we
don't
have
any
view
on
it.
but
at
the
same
time
the
court
said
well,
of
course
it
applies
in
--
in
the
other
--
other
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
perfectly
clear.
i
mean,
if
you
were
arguing
the
other
way,
you
would
say,
well,
the
question
is
whether
it's
clearly
if
there's
a
clear
difference
between
lack
of
remorse
in
the
sentencing
guideline
case
and
lack
of
remorse
in
a
capital
case,
and
everybody
knew
that,
so
that
when
mitchell
just
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
lack
of
remorse
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
nobody
would
think
that
meant
that
there
was
an
open
issue
on
the
capital
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
lenz,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
says
jurek
reads
to
the
contrary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
