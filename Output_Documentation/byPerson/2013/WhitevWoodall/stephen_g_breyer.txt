justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
about
--
i
mean,
i
think
the
relevant
pages
are
--
it's
at
526
u.s.
328
to
330.
probably
read
those
17
times.
all
right.
when
i
looked
at
those,
i
saw
they
reaffirmed
estelle.
as
they
quote
estelle,
they
say
its
reasoning
applies
with
full
force.
estelle
says,
"the
court
could
discern
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
the
guilt
and
penalty
phases
of
respondent's
capital
trial
so
far
as
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
concerned.
"
i
marked
five
separate
statements
in
those
two
pages
that
came
to
the
same
thing.
i
looked
at
estelle.
estelle
has
to
do
with
the
right
to
note
--
note
the
comment
that
he
wanted
in
respect
to
a
sentencing
fact
that
the
jury
was
going
to
decide;
namely,
future
dangerousness.
nothing
to
do
with
a
fact
about
the
crime.
a
sentencing
fact.
so
then
i
said,
well,
what
favors
you
here?
what
favors
you
is
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
on
330,
which
says,
"whether
silence
bears
upon
the
determination
of
a
lack
of
remorse
or
upon
acceptance
of
responsibility
for
purposes
of
the
downward
adjustment
provided
in
3e1.1
of
u.s.
sentencing
guidelines
is
a
separate
question.
"
"it
is
not
before
us
and
we
express
no
view
on
it.
"
right.
it's,
one,
not
just
a
sentencing
fact,
but
a
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant,
lack
of
remorse;
two,
it's
in
the
sentencing
guidelines;
three,
it
is
a
decision
for
a
judge,
not
the
jury.
if
it
isn't
confined
as
i
just
said
it,
then
mitchell
overrules
estelle,
what
it
explicitly
denies
doing.
here
we
have
sentencing
facts,
facts
about
his
childhood.
he
wanted
the
estelle
instruction.
the
judge
wouldn't
give
it.
that's
the
argument
against
you,
i
think.
and
i
would
like
to
hear
your
specific
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
the
facts
--
what
was
at
issue
here,
he
has
put
on
witnesses
that
show
that
he
had
a
bad
childhood
and
he
didn't
himself
testify
about
his
bad
childhood.
and
in
that
context,
he
asked
for
the
no
silence/silence
instruction.
the
government
did
not
object.
the
judge
then
refused
to
give
the
instruction.
all
right.
now,
what's
the
difference
between
the
facts
about
how
his
parents
raised
him
and
the
fact
of
future
dangerousness
in
estelle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
that
in
mitchell.
but
let
--
let
me
go
back,
just
elaborating
on
that,
to
justice
alito's
first
question.
i
want
to
see
if
this
issue
is
still
in
the
case.
you
looked
at
the
instruction,
and
the
instruction
is
just
a
broad
instruction.
it
says
no
adverse
inference
may
be
drawn
from
anything.
all
right.
so
there
seemed
to
be
some
objection
you
had
to
the
breadth
of
that
instruction.
so
i
looked
at
the
instruction.
the
instruction
does
say
exactly
what
justice
alito
said
and
you
have
said.
it
says
the
--
the
instruction
is
--
"the
defendant
is
not
compelled
to
testify,
and
the
fact
that
he
does
not
cannot
be
used
as
inference
of
guilt
and
should
not
prejudice
him
in
any
way.
"
with
a
couple
of,
here,
irrelevant
modifications.
all
right?
the
instruction
i
just
read
you
is
not
from
this
case.
it's
from
the
carter
case.
in
the
carter
case,
the
court
said
that
instruction
must
be
given.
it
must
be
given
at
the
sentencing
phase.
so
what
they
did
was
copy
the
instruction
out
of
the
case,
the
very
instruction
that
the
court
said,
in
carter,
the
fifth
amendment
requires
to
be
given
in
the
sentencing
phase.
and
that
was
a
noncapital
case.
so
what's
the
objection
to
the
instruction,
on
its
breadth?
not
only
is
it
the
same,
but
the
government
never
objected
that
it
was
too
broad,
and
the
only
issues
in
the
case
were
factual.
they
were
about
what
happened
to
him
in
his
childhood,
namely,
sentencing
facts.
and
the
instruction
that
you
did
read
about
what
they
should
consider
referred
to
facts
and
circumstances.
and
where
in
estelle
does
it
say
that
matters
at
sentencing
related
to
facts
and
circumstances,
you
don't
have
to
give
the
very
instruction
that
carter
and
estelle
required?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
overrule
--
does
it
overrule
estelle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
does
mitchell
--
estelle
talks
about
--
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
sentence,
in
a
capital
case
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
mitchell
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
low
iq
and
a
personality
disorder,
i
take
it,
were
the
mitigating
factors?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
a
case
where
there
are
witnesses
who
says
there
are
two
mitigating
factors,
he
has
a
very
low
iq
and
he
has
a
personality
disorder,
he
says
nothing.
the
jurors
go
in
the
room.
they
have
to
decide
does
he
have
a
low
iq
and
personality
disorder
and
what
weight
should
we
give
that
as
mitigators?
this
instruction
says:
jurors,
do
it.
just
when
you
do
it
don't
take
account
of
the
fact
that
he,
himself,
did
not
testify.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
--
that
--
so
that
jurors
are
perfectly
clear,
i
would
think.
what
i
think
is
difficult
for
you
is
just
what
your
friend
raised.
it
is
true
that
the
carter
instruction
refers
to
guilt.
you
took
that
instruction,
word
for
word,
and
you've
cut
out
"guilt"
because
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
guilt,
right.
estelle
says,
i
would
think,
that
you
have
a
right
to
a
carter
instruction
in
respect
to
some
sentencing
factors,
namely
future
dangerousness.
the
last
sentence
on
the
page
of
mitchell
says:
we
are
not
deciding
whether
you're
entitled
to
that
instruction
in
respect
to
other
sentencing
fabricators,
namely
remorse.
so
the
question
for
you
is
why
does
that
thing
--
that
sentence
about
remorse
in
mitchell,
why
isn't
it
at
least
ambiguous
about
whether
your
client
is
entitled
to
that
instruction
here?
and
your
response
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
say
--
what
we
said
here,
what
i've
gathered
from
the
record,
as
best
we've
been
able
to
see
it,
is
in
that
sentencing
hearing
--
you
were
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
know
it
pretty
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
there
were
five
matters
at
issue.
he
had
a
low
iq,
a
personality
disorder,
the
child
with
a
troubled
home,
he
had
grown
up
in
poverty,
he
had
been
sexually
abused.
all
right.
all
of
those
things
are
basically
factual
matters
about
his
background.
now,
in
that
context,
this
instruction,
which
was
the
carter
instruction
without
the
word
"guilt",
referring
to
his
failure
to
testify
is
--
doesn't
mention
those
five
things
specifically.
it
doesn't
say
testify
about
those
five
things.
but
in
context,
was
there
anything
else
in
that
hearing
that
the
jury
could
have
thought
failure
to
testify
referred
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
else
any
juror
might
have
thought,
oh,
he
didn't
testify
about
this
other
thing,
too?
was
there
some
other
thing
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
what
i'm
thinking
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
thinking
of
what
is
it
that
we
--
is
there
an
issue
in
this
case
about
whether
the
instruction,
on
top
of
whatever
other
problems
it
had,
was
too
broad?
so
i'm
thinking,
if
that
was
the
only
issue,
if
those
are
the
only
issues
that
this
instruction
could
have
been
thought
of
as
referring
to,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
breadth
matter.
that's
why
i
ask
you.
was
there
something
else
in
that
hearing
that
the
jury
might
have
thought,
oh,
he
didn't
testify
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
got
the
point.
but
you
have
to
answer
in
terms
of
what
the
facts
are
at
the
hearing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
was
his
remorse
an
issue
at
the
hearing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
answer--
