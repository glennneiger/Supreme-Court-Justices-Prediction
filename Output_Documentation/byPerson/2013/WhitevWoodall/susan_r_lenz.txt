ms.
susan
r.
lenz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
state
prisoner
cannot
obtain
habeas
relief
under
aedpa
unless
state
court
contravenes
or
unreasonably
applies
clearly
established
federal
law.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
clearly
established
federal
law.
under
any
interpretation
of
carter,
estelle,
and
mitchell,
this
court
has
never
extended
carter
to
the
selection
phase
of
a
capital
sentencing
trial.
because
there
is
no
clearly
established
federal
law,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
was
well
within
its
authority
to
resolve
this
unresolved
question
in
favor
of
affirming
the
sentence.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
there's
--
there
is
a
gap
between
mitchell
and
carter.
first
of
all,
mitchell
was
not
a
jury
instruction
case.
in
mitchell,
while
the
defendant
did
plead
guilty,
she
did
not
plead
guilty
to
all
of
the
conduct,
so
there
were
still
factors
that
were
being
contested.
in
this
case,
mr.
woodall
pled
guilty
to
all
of
the
crimes
and
aggravating
circumstances.
mitchell
and
estelle
were
both
concerned
with
protecting
the
defendant
from
the
prosecution
shifting
its
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
burden
shifting
because
robert
keith
woodall
had
already
pleaded
guilty
to
the
facts
which
the
prosecutor
was
required
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
render
mr.
woodall
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
proper.
under
kentucky
law,
the
attorney
could
not
refer
to--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--no.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
oh,
absolutely.
absolutely.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
i
guess
i
interpreted
justice
sotomayor's
question
a
little
bit
different
because
she
wasn't
referring
to
facts
in
evidence
or
--
or
to
some
type
of
evidence.
but
your
question
asks
the
--
the
question
about
whether
silence
bears
on
the
determination
of
a
lack
of
remorse.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
and
mitchell
specifically
left
that
open.
in
fact,
mitchell--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--well,
i
don't
think
there
was
actually
a
dispute
about
how
much
the
victim
suffered.
there,
i
think,
you
are
referring
to
the
testimony
of
the
blood
spatter
expert
where
--
wherein
he
was
talking
about
how
the
blood
was
splattered
around,
it
indicated
that
there
had
been
quite
a
struggle
when
the
victim's
throat
was
slashed.
and
trial
counsel--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--yes,
justice
kagan.
the
prosecutor
could
have
said
that
because
that
is
a
selection
factor.
that
--
the
fact
of
whether
the
victim
struggled
is
not
a
fact
that
makes
the
defendant
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
so
because
the
--
the
prosecutor
had
no
burden
of
proof
on
that,
the
defendant
wasn't
in
--
in
jeopardy
of
having
the
burden
shifted
to
him.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
mitchell,
yes.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i
think
that
the
core
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
--
has
been
protected.
yes,
i
do.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
in
estelle,
that
sentencing
factors
future
dangerousness,
and
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
make
mr.
smith
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
that's
a
very
different
fact
than
a
factor
of
what
you're
speaking
about,
which
would
be
a
selection
factor
and
the
prosecution
has--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--the
difference
is
the
burden
of
proof.
how
his
parents
raised
him
is
a
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
woodall
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
mitigating
circumstances.
the
jury
was
instructed
they
had
to
consider
the
mitigating
circumstances.
so
whether
mr.
woodall
testified
or
not,
we
assume
that
the
jury
followed
the
instructions
and
considered
the
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
yes,
sir.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right.
so,
in
essence,
it
really
shifts
the
burden
of
proof,
mr.
woodall's
burden
of
proof,
back
to
the
prosecution.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
that's
exactly
right.
and
i
think
the
judge
indicates--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--no,
justice
sotomayor,
because
there
are
two
rulings
in
mitchell,
and
the
first
ruling
in
mitchell
says
that
--
said
that
mitchell
still
had
the
fifth
amendment
right
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
after
the
guilty
plea.
that's
the
first
ruling
in
mitchell.
but
the
second
ruling
in
mitchell
then
limits
that.
it
doesn't
say
there
are
no
adverses,
no
adverse
inferences
whatsoever
that
can
be
inferred.
it
says
no
adverse
inferences
can
be
inferred
on
facts
and
circumstances
that
the
prosecutor
is
required
to
prove
which
increase
the
penalty
range.
so
there's
a
difference.
so--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
that's
right,
and
--
and
he
bears
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
and
he
bears
the
consequences
from
failing
to
meet
his
burden
on
that.
the
prosecution
has
absolutely
no
burden
with
regard
to
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
could
you
repeat
the
question?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
i
think
no,
and
remorse
is
different
because
again
that's
a
mitigating
circumstance
upon
which
woodall
has
the
burden
of
proof.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
it
makes
sense--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--it
makes
sense
to
not
--
the
purpose
of
the
no-adverse-inference
instruction
is
to
protect
the
defendant
from
the
prosecution
shifting
its
burden
of
proof,
in
other
words
using
his
silence
to
prove
one
of
the
elements
that
the
prosecution
is
required
to
prove.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
you
need
to
know
why
remorse
is
different,
is
that
what
you're
asking?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
yes.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
answer.
it's
just
that
remorse
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
and
the
prosecution
has
no
burden
of
proof
on
mitigating
circumstances.
that's
the
defendant's
choice
as
to
whether
he
wants
to
place
evidence
in
the
record
regarding
any
mitigating
circumstances
whatsoever.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
in
this
case
the
jury
was
not
instructed
that
mr.
woodall
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
mitigating
circumstances.
they
were
instructed
to
consider
the
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
no,
they
were
not.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i
don't
think
it
speaks
to
who
has
the
burden.
it
just
speaks
to
the
fact
that
they're
required
to
consider--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--he
does.
he
does.
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
i
do
think--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--i
think
there
--
there
is
a
difference
between
the
prosecution
and
the
court
not
telling
the
jury
that,
that
they
can
take
the
defendant's
silence
into
consideration,
i
do.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
the
--
the
only
situation
that
i
i'm
aware
of
that
the
court
has,
that
it
has
extended
griffin
with
this
carter
instruction
is
in
the
guilt
phase,
where
the
prosecution
is
still
required
to
prove
guilt.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
you
said
that
in
every
case,
but
one,
i
suppose,
except
for
mitchell;
and
that's
the
most
important
case
here.
the
court
in
mitchell
said
that
the
jury
couldn't
infer
anything
negative
from
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
upon
which
the
prosecutor--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--all
right.
i
have
several
things
to
say.
first
of
all,
i
disagree
with
two
things,
respectfully,
that
you
said
about
carter.
the
instruction
in
carter
was
different.
the
instruction
in
carter
was
about
guilt,
and
actually
--
and
mr.
woodall
concedes
--
they
left
that
part
out
of
this
instruction.
this
instruction
says
no
negative
inferences
about
anything
whatsoever.
that's
not
what
carter
said.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
carter
is
talking
about
guilt,
and
it's
limited.
and
also,
the
carter
instruction
had
to
do
with
the
guilt
phase
rather
than
the
sentencing
phase.
and
estelle
was
not
a
jury
instruction
case
and
didn't
say
anything
about
carter
whatsoever.
so
estelle
didn't
extend
carter
at
all.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i'm
sorry?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
yes,
mitchell
was
about
sentencing.
and
mitchell
is
the
case
which
answers
the
--
the
last
part
of
the
question,
justice
breyer.
you
said
where
does
it
say
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime?
that
language
is
in
mitchell.
mitchell
clearly
says
that
no
adverse
inferences
may
be
made
on
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
upon
which
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
--
and
upon
which
will
increase--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--does
mitchell
overrule
estelle?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
i
don't
think
mitchell
says
that.
it's
not
that
broad.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
or
excuse
me.
estelle
doesn't
say
that.
estelle's
not
that
broad.
it
doesn't
speak
about
a
jury
instruction.
and
even
mitchell
doesn't
say
--
it
--
it
says
something
very
broad,
the
fifth
amendment
applies
during
the
penalty
phase,
but
it
doesn't
make
a
distinction
between
the
eligibility
part
of
the
penalty
phase
and
the
selection
part
of
the
penalty
phase.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
the
rule
against
adverse
inferences
from
carter
is
all
about
incrimination
and
guilt.
and
in
this
case,
mr.
woodall's
pled
guilty
to
all
of
the
crimes
and
aggravating
circumstances.
so
his
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty
was
already
met
before
the
penalty
phase
even
began.
and
i'm
sorry.
what
was
your
question?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
your
reading
of
the
cases,
but
even
if
--
even
if
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
the
case
and
that
adverse
inferences
apply
to
everything
but
factors
such
as
lack
of
remorse
or
downward
adjustment
in
the
sentencing
guidelines,
that
leaves
a
huge
hole
in
mitchell.
you
could
drive
a
truck
through
that
hole
because,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
mitchell,
the
bulk
of
what
sentencing
is
about
are
these
other
factors,
the
other
factors,
what
kind
of
childhood
he
had,
mitigation
and
all
of
that
sort
of
thing.
so
there's
still
a
lot
of
room.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
thank
you.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
at
the
beginning
of
his
responsive
argument
my
colleague
was
talking
about
the
selection
factors
in
estelle.
and
whether
they're
called
selection
factors
or
whatever
they're
called,
the
prosecutor
had
to
prove
future
dangerousness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
render
the
defendant
in
that
case
death
eligible.
there
were
three
things
that
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
and
that
was
one
of
them.
so
those
selection
factors
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
operated
as
aggravating
circumstances
for
the
death
penalty.
so
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
court
is
clear
on
that.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
no,
jurek
does
not
read
to
the
contrary,
no.
i
mean,
i
--
perhaps
he's
saying
that
because
of
the
reference
to
calling
them
selection
factors.
when
one
speaks
of
selection
factors,
one
usually
doesn't
think
of
death-eligibility
factors.
so
my
only
point
is,
regardless
of
nomenclature,
they
operated
as
aggravating
circumstances,
the
prosecution's
burden.
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
that's
not
true,
justice
sotomayor,
because
it
would
depend
on
what
the
violation
is,
what
the
error
is.
i
think
in
this
case,
when
you
consider
the
absence
of
this
prophylactic
instruction
in
comparison
with
the
heinousness
of
the
crimes,
the
guilty
plea,
the
overwhelming
evidence,
his
prior
convictions
for
sexual
abuse,
his
post-crime
conduct,
all
of
it,
when
you
consider
that
together--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--the
mitigation
was?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i'm
sorry?
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
i
think--
ms.
susan
r.
lenz
--i
think
the
mitigation
was
--
was
negligible
in
comparison
to
--
to
the
rest
of
the
crimes.
and
the
other
point
that
i
would
just
like
to
make
is
that
there
was
not
clearly
established
law
in
this
case,
and
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
decision
was
not
an
error
beyond
any
possibility
for
fair-minded
disagreement.
thank
you.
