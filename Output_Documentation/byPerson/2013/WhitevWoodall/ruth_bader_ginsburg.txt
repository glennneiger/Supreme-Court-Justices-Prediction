justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
position
basically
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
a
--
an
affirmative
defense
and
that
defendant
carries
the
burden
on
remorse
--
and
what
was
the
other
one
that
mitchell
saved
out?
acceptance
of
responsibility?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
defendant
says
nothing,
then
he
hasn't
--
he
hasn't
proved
a
mitigator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
we
--
it
wasn't
controversial
that
on
mitigating
factors
the
defendant
does
have
the
burden.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
--
is
there
a
difference
between
the
prosecutor
saying,
judge,
i
want
you
to
charge
this
jury
that
they
can
use
defendant's
silence
against
him,
or
a
judge
on
his
own
telling
the
jury
that,
or
the
judge,
as
here,
simply
refusing
to
say
you
can't
take
it
into
account?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
all
those
the
same
or
would
you
distinguish
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
courts
in
those
cases
had
a
specific
issue
before
it.
its
attention
wasn't
called
to
what
i
suggested
is
in
the
nature
of
an
affirmative
defense.
the
defendant
has
the
burden
to
persuade
the
jury
on
mitigators.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
other
--
defendant
didn't
say,
i'm
sorry.
was
there
--
was
there
anything
else?
did
the
defendant
produce
anything
else
in
the
way
of
remorse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
curious
about
one
facet
of
this
case.
this
instruction
was
sought
by
the
defendant.
the
prosecutor
had
no
objection
to
it.
the
judge
said:
i'm
sorry,
i
am
not
going
to
use
that
instruction.
is
that
common
in
kentucky,
that
both
parties
agree
that
an
instruction
should
be
given
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
not
going
to
give
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
this
be
--
let's
assume
that
you're
right,
that
there
was
error.
how
could
it
be
harmful,
given
the
--
that
the
mitigators
--
that
the
aggravators
were
not
in
dispute,
he
had
entered
a
guilty
plea?
so
how
was
the
defendant
harmed
by
the
failure
to
give
this
instruction?
