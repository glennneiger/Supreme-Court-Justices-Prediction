mr.
laurence
e.
komp
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
estelle,
this
court
held
that
there
are
no
--
there's
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
guilt
and
penalty
phases
in
a
capital
trial.
mitchell
did
not
disturb
that
ruling,
did
not
overrule
that
ruling.
as
--
as
this
court
indicated,
the
key
components
of
the
mitchell
opinion
that
have
been
discussed
today
are
from
pages
328
to
330.
and
on
those
pages
are
littered
with
the
discussion
of
what
the
clear
principles
of
this
court's
authority
are.
for
instance,
on
page
329,
"our
holding
today
is
a
product
of
existing
precedent.
"
"not
only
griffin,
but
also
by
estelle
v.
smith
in
which
the
court
could
discern
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
the
guilt
and
penalty
phases
of
respondent's
capital
murder
trial
so
far
as
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
concerned.
"
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
your
honor,
if
i
may,
and
just
to
--
to
--
under
kentucky
law,
there
is
--
i
think
justice
alito
sort
of
spoke
to
this,
or
i
forget
which
justice.
there's
a
difference
between
a
burden
of
production
and
a
burden
of
proof.
and
absolutely,
a
--
a
defendant
in
--
in
a
sentencing
hearing
has
the
burden
of
production,
as
a
proponent
of
what
is
going
to
be
their
mitigation
theory.
that's
much
different
than
a
burden
of
proof.
in
this
case,
instruction
6,
which
is
found
at
joint
appendix
page
44,
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
government
to
establish
that
the
aggravating
circumstances,
both
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
nonstatutory
aggravating
circumstances,
had
to
outweigh
the
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
well,
in
that
case,
again,
if
--
if
there's
no
mitigating
evidence
presented,
you
don't
know
if
it's
what
instruction
4
will
look
--
look
like.
but
taking
your
hypothetical
and
you're
in
that
jury
room,
if
you're
given
the
carter
instruction
--
again,
it
wasn't
given
in
this
case.
so
if
you're
given
that
carter
instruction,
all
that
prohibits
is
--
is
raising
a
negative
inference
against
the
defendant
for
the
failure
to
exercise
his
right
to
testify.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
and
that's
right
--
that's
the
--
that's
straight
out
of
the
carter--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--well,
but
he
can't
--
again,
i
think
in
your
hypothetical
that
he's
presented
nothing.
and
so
he
can't
be
penalized
again
for
presenting
nothing.
and
you
can't
allow--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--correct.
and
so--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--right.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
in
--
in
that
circumstance,
again,
he
--
he
can't
--
they
can't,
for
instance,
kentucky
is
a
nonweighing
state,
so
that
means
that
they
can
--
that
nonstatutory
aggravation
is
on
the
table,
anything
they
want
to
consider.
and
what
this
carter
instruction
would
prohibit
is
--
is
preventing
his
failure
to
testify,
his
failure
to
offer
a
lack
of
remorse,
to
say,
i'm
sorry,
which
are
the
natural
inclinations
of
what
jurors
--
natural
inclinations
but
constitutionally
impermissible
inclinations,
from
adding
that
onto
the
death
side
of
the
scale.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--in
this
--
in
this
case,
no.
remorse
was
not
a
mitigation
theory
that
was
presented
by
defense
counsel.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
my
--
my
response
to
that
is
--
is
twofold.
one,
as
--
in
--
as
this
court
was
walking
through
in
the
opening
presentation,
mitchell
was
not
overruled
--
or,
i'm
sorry,
estelle
was
not
overruled
by
mitchell.
it
relied
on
estelle
and
the
griffin
line
of
cases
as
the
--
as
the
clearly
existing
authority.
when
you
get
to
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--two
points,
and
one
is,
when
this
instruction
was
requested,
mitchell
had
not
been
decided.
so
the
slate
was
griffin,
carter,
estelle,
and
mitchell
came
out
prior
to
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
ruling.
so
this
instruction
was
based
on
--
you
know,
without
the
reservation
that
exists.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
i
think
you
have
--
we
have
to
examine
what
mitchell
--
mitchell,
again,
was
framed
as
a
federal
sentencing
guidelines
case,
and
that
passage
i
read
earlier
from
mitchell,
the
next
sentence
is:
"and
although
estelle
was
a
capital
case,
its
reasoning
applies
with
full
force
here,
where
the
government
seeks
to
use
petitioner's
silence
to
infer
commission
of
disputed
acts.
"
and
what
--
what
this
court
was
doing
was
extending
estelle
into
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
case,
and
it
wasn't
at
the
same
time
cutting
back
on
estelle
the
fifth
--
the
recognition
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
at
the
capital
sentencing.
our
read
of
that
exception,
the
language,
is
that
whether
silence
bears
upon
the
determination
of
lack
of
remorse
or
upon
acceptance
of
responsibility
for
purposes
of
the
downward
adjustment
provided
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
it's
clear
that
that
relates
to
fair
--
to
federal
sentencing
guidelines
cases.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
or
possibly
noncapital
cases,
because
this
court
didn't
simultaneously
accept
estelle
as
the
clearly
existing
law
and
then
cut
it.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
but
i
think
the
answer
is
found
within
estelle,
because
estelle
was
based
on
the
future
dangerousness,
and
the
psychiatrist
that
--
or,
pardon
me,
psychologist
that
testified
in
estelle,
his
finding
of
future
dangerousness,
which
is
a
selection
question
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
eligibility,
his
finding
of
future
dangerousness
was
based
on
lack
of
remorse.
estelle
isn't
just
a
compulsion
case.
there
was
a
component
of
silence.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
under
this
court's
--
the
then
texas
statute
as
defined
by
this
court
in
jurek,
that
special
circumstances
question
at
that
time
was
a
selection
factor.
it
was
not
an
eligibility
factor.
eligibility
had
already
been
determined.
and
that's
based
on
this
court's
authority
in
jurek.
and
we
--
and
we
cited
to
state
v.
brethard
in
the
red
brief,
which
is
texas's
description
of
their
--
of
those
special
circumstances
questions
at
the
time.
so
this
court
has
applied
this
fifth
amendment
prohibition
in
a
pure
sentencing
selection
occasion,
and
estelle
deals
with
--
there's
a
component
of
silence
to
it
because
the
psychologist
that
testified
as
to
the
future
dangerousness
factor
relied
on
the
silence
of
the
individual,
his
failure
specifically
to
say
i'm
sorry
and
express
remorse
about
the
actions
that
he
did.
and
this
court
cited
that
component
as
part
of
what
the
psychologist
relied
on
in
making
the
future
dangerousness
assessment.
so
estelle
is
not
totally
--
it
obviously
has
a
compulsion
component
and
it's
driven
by
the
miranda
violation,
but
there
is
a
component
of
estelle
which
relies
specifically
on
silence
and
how
the
silence
was
used
to
penalize
the
individual
in
becoming
a
factor
in
favor
of
death
in
the
selection
process.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
i
--
i
can't
speak
--
i
don't
want
to
speak
too
broadly
for
what
happens,
but
it's
--
i
think
when
both
parties
usually
agree,
the
instruction
is
given.
but
i
don't
want
to
stretch
it
too
far
and
say
that
on
every
occasion.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
important
because
this
was
a
--
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
object,
you
know,
demonstrates
that
--
that
the
instruction
should
have
been
given.
if
he
--
if
he
felt
that
this
instruction
shouldn't
have
been
given,
or
there
was
no
legal
basis
for
the
instruction--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--well,
i
--
i
think--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--oh,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
absolutely
not.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i
think
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i
--
i
think
as
a
--
as
a
lawyer,
if
you
--
your
--
the
basis
of
your
objection
or
your
failure
to
object
is
based
on
what
you
believe
is
--
is
legally
required,
especially
when
you're
a
prosecutor,
and
--
and
you
have
that
added
burden
of
not
seeking
a
conviction
or
not
seeking
the
death
sentence--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i
was
not.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
the
--
in
--
in--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--it
doesn't,
your
honor,
it
just
doesn't
go
to
mitigation,
because
i
--
i
think
that
goes--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--but
--
but
--
right.
but
it
goes--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--in
this
--
in
this
--
pardon
me.
in
this
circumstance,
what
--
the
facts
that
were
going
on
in
this
hearing,
the
--
that
instruction
could
go
to,
again,
holding
his
--
his
silence
as
to
how
--
and
offering
--
failure
--
failing
to
offer
an
explanation
and
respond--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--remorse
wasn't
put
at
issue
by
--
by
mr.
woodall.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
it
--
it
can
be
a
factor,
but
it
can't
--
this
--
the
lack
of
remorse
as
the
nonstatutory
aggravator
cannot
be
premised
upon
his
silence.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
yes,
his
lack
of
remorse.
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
estelle
dealt
with
that
in
the
capital
context.
again,
the
--
the
distinction
that
we're
drawing
from
mitchell
is
that
--
that
mitchell
did
not
modify
estelle.
it
expanded
estelle
into
a
federal
sentencing
or
other
criminal
case
--
cases.
it
did
not
touch
--
it
remained
intact
the
prohibition
of
--
of
using
silence.
again,
estelle
dealt
with
silence,
and
silence
that
was
used
to
support
a
lack
of
remorse,
which
was
used
to
support
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i'm
--
pardon
me.
mitchell
left
intact
estelle's
application
at
the
capital
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
could
you
--
could
you
please
repeat
the
--
the
first
part?
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i
--
i
disagree.
because
these
--
these
capital
sentencing
proceedings
are
not
just
about
remorse
or
lack
of
remorse.
and
what
--
what
would
happen
in
that
circumstance
is
--
is
right
now
you
have
a
bright
line.
and
if
--
if
we
accept
remorse
out
of
this
in
the
capital
sentencing
context,
there's
two
problems
with
that.
one,
we
would
have
hybrid
carter
instructions
and
there
would
be
--
we'd
have
to
figure
out
all
right,
which
instruction
would
fit
if
we
looked--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i
believe
that
estelle
settled
this
and
mitchell
did
not
cut
back
on
estelle
in
the
capital
sentencing
context,
and
that
estelle
imported
the
no-adverse
instruction
that's
required
by
carter.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
i
--
pardon
me.
if
you
--
if
we
look
at
mitchell,
and
we
look
at
the
discussion
of
the
no-adverse-inference
instruction--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--one,
i
don't
think
this
court
in
williams
said
that
--
that
--
or
not
--
that
aedpa
is
not
a
subjective
juror/judge
contest.
and
if
you
read
mitchell
and
it
talks
about
this
is
a
product
of
our
existing
precedent,
this
is
a
rule
of
proven
utility,
this
is
an
essential
feature
of
our
justice
system,
the
--
the
rule
was
--
was
absolutely
clear
that
--
that
these
no
--
no-adverse-inferences
could
be
raised.
and
that
was
a
--
a
rule
of
proven
utility.
and
all
that
mitchell
did
in
that
one
sentence
is
reserve
a
question
that
--
that
may
or
may
not
be
applicable
in
federal
sentencing
or
noncapital
sentencing.
it
did
not
cut
back
on
estelle,
which
said
for
--
that
there
is
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
the
guilt
and
penalty
phases
of
capital
cases.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
right.
this
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--i
--
no,
we
would
think
it's
an
open
issue,
because
if
you
--
if
you
go
through
the
--
the
mitchell
opinion
and
how
it
builds
on
the
no
adverse
--
no
adverse
inference
and
talks
about
griffin
and
estelle,
and
then
the
--
the
key
language
is
at
--
at
329:
"although
estelle
was
a
capital
case,
its
reasoning
applies
with
full
force
here.
"
so
this
was
a
pushing
forward
of
estelle.
it
wasn't
a
cutting
back
on
estelle.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
i
think
in
two
manners:
one
is
when
you're
--
relates
to
using
the
right
to
silence
as
a
penalty,
which
is
the
natural
inclination
of
--
of
the
jurors.
so
they're
going
to
hold
his
--
his
failure
to
testify
against
him.
and
they'll
do
it
twofold.
they'll
actually
put
it
on
the
scale:
he
didn't
say
that
he
was
sorry,
he
didn't
personally
offer
remorse,
so
we're
going
to
consider
that
as
not--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--no.
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
well,
they
--
that's
the
natural,
what
this
court
recognizes,
the
natural
inclinations
of
what
jurors
do.
and
this
prosecutor
--
and
it's
laid
out
in
our
red
brief
--
although
he
technically
said,
"i'm
not
going
to
argue
lack
of
remorse,
but
i'm
going
to
do
everything
but
that.
"
so
that
was
clearly
where
--
where
he
was
pointing.
the
other
--
what
--
the
other
impact
it
has
is
this
was
a
case
that
there
was
strong
mitigation.
this
is
somebody
who's
borderline
mentally
retarded,
has
a
personality
disorder
which
doesn't
allow
him
to
function
in
society.
but
there's
also
a
strong
element
of
skipper
evidence.
so
when
you're
asking
for
a
life
without
parole
and
you
have
expert
testimony
saying
this
individual
is
not
going
to
be
a
danger
to
correction
officers,
and
you
have
a
jailer
that
testifies
that
he's
well-mannered
and
well-behaved
and
is
not
a
problem
at
all,
and
you
have
the
background
that
he
has,
this
--
that's
a
strong
mitigation
narrative.
and
if
the
defendant
doesn't
testify
in
support
of
that,
that
undermines
that
mitigation
narrative.
so
the
failure
to
testify
and
the
failure
to
offer
this
instruction
has
--
has
sort
of
two
--
two
arms.
it--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--absolutely.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
absolutely.
and
this
court
considers
the
death
penalty
case
--
all
death
--
any
death
penalty
case
has
horrible
facts.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
i
believe
that
they
cited
brecht
and
they
cited
o'neal
appropriately.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
i
think
the
reference
to
carter
was
to
talk
about
--
we're
talking
about
assessing
the
harmfulness
of
this
error
or
the
harmlessness
of
this
error
in
the
context
of
an
instruction
that
wasn't
given,
where
the
instruction
that's
not
given
prevents
negative
inferences.
so
the
reference
to
carter
was
to
talk
about
what
--
what
the
natural
inclination
for
the
failure
to
give
the
instruction
is.
it
was
sort
of
a
framework
of
what's
going
on.
so
i
don't
think
it
was
used
in
that
circumstance.
where
--
and
when
they
ultimately
came
to
their
conclusion,
they
relied,
again,
on
citing
expressly
the
o'neal
standard.
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
--
it's
not
offering
an
apology,
not
--
not
saying
why
or
not
explaining
how.
i
think
there's
--
there's
so
many
things
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
komp
--that
a
juror
wants
to
hear,
naturally
wants
to
hear.
and
that's
what
the
basis
that
this
court
held
in
carter
is
this
--
why
this
instruction
is
appropriate.
thank
you.
