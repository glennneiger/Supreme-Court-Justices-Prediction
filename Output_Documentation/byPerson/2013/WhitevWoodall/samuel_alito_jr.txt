justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
ms.
lenz,
am
i
correct,
the
instruction
that
was
requested
but
not
given
was
as
follows:
quote,
"a
defendant
is
not
compelled
to
testify
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
should
not
prejudice
him
in
any
way.
"
that
was
the
instruction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
suppose
that
the
--
you
put
on
evidence
of
--
to
show
that
he
was
qualified
for
the
death
penalty
and
put
on
evidence
of
aggravating
factors,
and
the
defense
put
on
absolutely
no
mitigation
evidence.
the
instruction
would
say,
would
it
not,
that
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
should
not
prejudice
him
in
any
way
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
put
on
any
mitigation
evidence
at
all?
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
when
a
party
has
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
on
something,
isn't
the
customary
way
of
dealing
with
that
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
to
show
this,
rather
than
to
--
to
talk
about
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
their
failure,
from
that
party's
failure
to
produce
evidence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
jury
was
instructed:
"you
shall
consider
such
mitigating
or
extenuating
facts
and
circumstances
as
have
been
presented
to
you
in
the
evidence
and
you
believe
to
be
true.
"
now,
i
suppose
they
could
have
been
--
the
mitigating
evidence
could
have
been
put
in
by
the
prosecution,
but
for
the
most
part
they're
going
to
be
put
in
by
the
defense.
so
when
the
judge
says
you
can
consider
whatever
mitigating
evidence
has
been
presented
to
you,
isn't
that
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
of
mitigation
if
the
defendant
wants
to
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
this
example.
let
me
pretend
to
be
a
juror
in
a
--
in
a
kentucky
capital
case.
and
the
--
and
let's
assume
in
this
case
the
prosecution
puts
on
evidence
to
show
eligibility
and
some
evidence
of
aggravating
factors.
the
defense
puts
on
no
evidence
of
mitigation.
now,
the
judge
tells
me
you
shall
consider
such
mitigating
or
extenuating
facts
and
circumstances
as
have
been
presented
to
you
in
the
evidence,
and
you
believe
to
be
true.
okay?
that's
instruction
number
4.
i
assume
that
you
don't
have
an
objection
to
that.
and
then
the
judge
gives
the
instruction
that
you
requested:
a
defendant
is
not
compelled
to
testify,
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
should
not
prejudice
him
in
any
way.
so
now
i'm
back
in
the
jury
room,
and
i
say,
well,
now
i
have
to
consider
mitigating
evidence.
and,
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
could
be
mitigating
in
a
capital
case.
i'd
like
to
know
about
the
defendant's
childhood.
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
defendant
was
--
was
abused.
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
defendant
was
remorseful.
and
i
haven't
heard
anything
about
this.
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
because
the
judge
told
me
i
should
consider
the
mitigating
evidence
that's
been
presented
to
me.
on
the
other
hand,
the
judge
told
me
that
the
failure
--
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
put
on
any
mitigating
evidence
can't
prejudice
him
in
any
way.
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
really.
it
says
the
fact
that
he
didn't
testify,
and
he
could
have
testified
about
child
--
about
his
childhood
or
about
remorse
or
any
of
these
other
things,
that
shouldn't
prejudice
him
in
any
way.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
just
tell
me
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
as
a
juror.
the
judge
says
consider
the
evidence
that's
put
before
you,
but
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
put
this
evidence
before
you
in
the
form
of
his
testimony
shouldn't
prejudice
him
in
any
way.
i'm
--
i'm
pulled
in
two
different
directions.
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
it
may
show
is
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
think
that
it
was
going
to
make
a
difference,
and
so
why
raise
an
objection
that
could
create
everything
that's
happened
since
then,
over
something
that
isn't
going
to
make
a
difference
in
a
case
where
you
have
an
incredibly
heinous
crime.
the
prosecutor
may
have
thought,
this
jury
is
going
to
return
the
verdict
that
i
want
anyway,
even
if
this
instruction
is
given.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
think
that's
a
possibility?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
think
is
the
worse
adverse
inference
they
might
have
drawn?
