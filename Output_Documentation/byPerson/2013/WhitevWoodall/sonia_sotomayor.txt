justice

do
you
think
it
would
have
been
okay
for
the
trial
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
use
the
defendant's
silence
against
him?
would
the
affirmative
statement
have
been
constitutional
and
not
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
didn't
ask
about
kentucky
law.
do
you
think
the
fifth
amendment
permits
the
judge
to
have
said,
use
silence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
use
silence
to
punish
him
because
he's
just
a
bad
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
that
doesn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
there
was
a
factual
dispute
as
to
how
much
the
witness
--
the
victim
had
suffered.
how
about
a
statement
about
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
call
him
to
ask
him
if
he
feels
sorry?
if
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
right,
could
you
call
him
to
the
stand
and
ask
him,
are
you
sorry?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what
did
you
just
say?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
mitchell
did,
though,
the
sentencing
aspect.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mitchell
was
about
sentencing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
nothing
--
zero
equals
zero.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
zero
just
can't
be
added
onto
or
taken
away
from.
zero
is
zero,
not
a
positive,
not
a
negative.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
can't
take
away
from
the
zero,
create
evidence
from
his
silence,
just
as
you
can't
from
his
silence
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances;
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
could--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--did
the
prosecutor
argue
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
would
they
have
put
that
on
the
scale?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
only
criteria
to
determine
harmlessness
is
the
gruesome
--
gruesome
nature
of
the
crime,
it
appears
to
me
that
in
almost
every
death-eligible
case
i've
come
across,
gruesomeness
is
inherent.
by
your
argument,
there's
never
a
case
in
which
a
defendant
can
prove
a
harmful
sentencing
error.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
mitigation
was
very
close
to
wiggins.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
very
close
to
the
wiggins
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
mitigation
evidence
offered
here
was
very
close
to
the
wiggins
case,
similar
mitigation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there
we
held
there
was
harmful
error.
