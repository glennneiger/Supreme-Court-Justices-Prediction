justice
antonin
scalia
under
federal
law,
you
don't
think
the
judge
could
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
defendant
has
already
pleaded
guilty
to
a
horrible
crime.
this
is
a
punishment
hearing.
he
has
chosen
not
to
--
not
to
testify
in
this
--
in
this
hearing.
you
--
you
are
--
if
you
wish,
you
may
take
his
failure
to
testify
as
an
indication
that
he
does
not
have
remorse,
that
he
is
not
sorry.
he
could
have
come
before
you
said
and
said
i
am
terribly
sorry,
i
wish
i
had
never
done
it,
i
will
never
do
it
again.
he
has
chosen
not
to
testify.
you
may,
if
you
wish,
take
that
into
account
in
determining
whether
--
whether
there
is
remorse.
you
can't
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
your
answer
should
have
been
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
question
is
even
narrower.
that
instruction
would
forbid
the
jury
from
even
taking
into
account
his
failure
to
testify
on
--
on
the
one
factor
of
remorse
--
the
one
psychological
factor
of
remorse.
and
if
you
say
that
you're
not
entitled
to
such
an
instruction
on
that,
that
alone
would
have
--
would
have
been
enough
to
deny
the
requested
instruction.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
also
weren't
instructed
to
draw
any
inferences,
were
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
the
--
the
issue
here
is
whether
you
must
instruct
them
not
to
draw
inferences,
not
--
not
whether
--
whether
--
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
demonstrate
anything
of
the
sort.
it
just
means
that
he
didn't
object.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
he
was
a
very
bad
lawyer.
who
knows?
we're
--
we're
going
to
determine
our
law
on
the
basis
of
whether
a
government
lawyer
made
an
objection
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
most,
it
shows
that
he
didn't
think
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it.
does
that
mean
we
have
to
think
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
trying
to
help
you,
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
remorse?
wasn't
remorse
at
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever.
i
mean,
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
take
that
into
account.
isn't
it
one
of
--
one
of
the
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
but
you
have
to
go
beyond
saying
i
believe
that.
what
you
have
to
say
to
prevail
here
is
not
only
do
i
believe
it,
but
no
reasonable
juror
--
no
reasonable
jurist
could
possibly
believe
otherwise.
now,
do
you
want
to
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
reasonable
jurors
could
say
otherwise?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
made
the
difference,
that
the
jury
would
not
have
condemned
your
client
to
death
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
they
drew
an
adverse
inference
from
--
they
knew
all
the
horrific
details
of
the
crime.
they
had
heard
all
of
your
mitigating
evidence.
and
you
think
what
--
what
tipped
the
balance,
or
at
least
we
think
it
plausibly
could
have
tipped
the
balance,
is
--
is
this
failure
to
give
the
no-adverse-inference
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what--
