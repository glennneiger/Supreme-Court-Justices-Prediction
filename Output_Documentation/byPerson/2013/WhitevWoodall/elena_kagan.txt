justice
elena
kagan
ms.
lenz,
could
i
ask
you
about
what
you
just
said?
you
said
carter,
estelle,
and
mitchell;
those
are
the
three.
so
carter
says
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
a
criminal
trial
judge
must
give
a
no-adverse-inference
jury
instruction
when
requested
by
a
defendant.
and
that
was,
of
course,
not
a
sentencing
case.
then
estelle
says,
we
discern
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
the
guilt
and
penalty
phases
of
respondent's
capital
murder
trial
so
far
as
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment;
so
a
kind
of
general
view
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
equally
in
the
two.
and
then
mitchell
holds
--
it
basically
repeats
that
from
estelle
and
says,
we
must
accord
the
privilege
the
same
protection
in
the
sentencing
phase
of
any
criminal
case,
as
that
which
is
due
in
the
trial
phase.
so
when
you
put
those
together,
carter
with
estelle,
mitchell,
how
--
why
do
you
think
that
there's
a
gap?
justice
elena
kagan
but
take
the
--
take
the
hypothetical,
ms.
lenz,
that
suppose,
you
know,
the
prosecutor
had
said
you
just
heard
testimony
from
our
expert
that
--
the
blood
spattering
expert,
that
the
victim's
suffering
was
especially
prolonged,
and
look,
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand.
why
didn't
he
take
the
stand
to
deny
that?
all
right?
so
could
the
prosecutor
have
said
that
at
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you're
suggesting
that
what
we
haven't
decided,
if
you
will,
goes
beyond
the
remorse
question
of
--
that
we
--
that
we
talked
about
in
--
not
mitchell,
but
--
is
it
mitchell?
justice
elena
kagan
it
goes
beyond
the
remorse
question.
and
you're
saying
that
really,
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
fifth
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
anything
that
happens
there
essentially,
because
once
--
once
the
person
has
been
found
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
a
prosecutor
and
a
jury
can
--
can
draw
whatever
inferences
they
want.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
where
does
that
difference
come
from?
because
i
thought
that
every
time
and
in
every
circumstance
that
we've
prohibited
an
adverse
inference
we've
also
required
a
requested
jury
instruction.
i
don't
know
of
a
--
of
a
case
or
any
principle
that
would
suggest
that
we
can
tear
those
two
things
apart
and
say,
well,
look,
an
adverse
inference
is
prohibited,
but,
no,
you
don't
get
an
instruction.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i'm
asking
a
different
question.
do
you
have
any
case
that
suggests
that
those
two
things
don't
go
hand
and
hand?
because
my
--
my
sort
of
reading
of
our
case
law
is
that
they
do.
any
time
we've
said
an
adverse
inference
is
prohibited,
we've
also
said
the
defendant
is
titled
--
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
about
adverse
inferences
if
he
requests
it.
justice
elena
kagan
but
in
not
making
that
distinction,
i
mean,
it
does
speak
very
broadly,
and
it
says,
you
know
--
i'm
reading
another
quotation
from
it.
"the
rule
against
negative
inferences
at
a
criminal
trial
apply
with
equal
force
at
sentencing.
"
now,
it
does
have
this
exception
for
remorse
or
a
possible
exception
for
remorse.
but
with
that
exception,
otherwise,
it
says
the
rule
against
adverse
inferences
applies,
doesn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
my
question
was
just
the
breadth
of
these
statements
about
everything
that
applies
at
trial
with
respect
to
adverse
inferences
also
applies
at
the
sentencing
phase,
with
the
possible
exception
of
adverse
inferences
about
remorse.
that's
the
way
i
read
the
cases.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
estelle
might
not
have
been
overruled,
but
there's
a
caveat
that
mitchell
puts
in,
and
it's
a
caveat
about
remorse
and
that
remorse
might
be
different.
and
the
question
is
why
doesn't
that
caveat
suggest,
at
the
very
least,
that
the
instruction
that
you
asked
for
was
so
broad
that
it
went
beyond
what
this
court
has
decided.
because
the
instruction
that
you
asked
for
did
not
distinguish
remorse
from
other
issues
that
were
going
to
come
before
the
jury
at
the
sentencing
phase.
so
at
the
very
least
it
seems
that
instruction
sort
of
blows
by
the
question
that
we
have
reserved.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
so
how
was
it
an
issue
at
the
hearing?
because
that
would
seem
to
cut
against
you
very
strongly,
mr.
komp.
if
remorse
is
an
issue
at
the
hearing,
remorse
is
the
very
thing
that
in
mitchell
we
said
we
have
not
decided.
and
then
you
have
no
clearly
established
law
to
rely
on.
and
i
appreciate
that
this
was
before
mitchell
rather
than
after
mitchell;
but
it
suggests
that
there
was
always
a
question
about
whether
estelle
applied
to
remorse.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
komp,
did
the
sixth
circuit
apply
the
wrong
harmlessness
standard
here?
it
seemed
to
a
apply
the
standard
that
would
be
applicable
on
direct
review
rather
than
on
habeas
review;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
because
it
seems
to
rely
primarily
on
carter.
and
carter
applies
the
chapman
standard,
which
is
of
course
the
direct
review
standard.
