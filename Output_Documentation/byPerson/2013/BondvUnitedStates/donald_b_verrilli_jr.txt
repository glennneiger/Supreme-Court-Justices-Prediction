mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
framers
gave
the
federal
government
exclusive
control
over
the
treaty
function
to
ensure
that
it
could
knit
the
nation
together
as
one
and
allow
it
to
be
fully
sovereign
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs.
petitioner's
ad
hoc
“
too
local
”
limit
on
the
treaty
power
can't
be
squared
with
a
judgment
the
framers
made,
this
court's
precedent,
or
consistent
historical
practice
since
the
time
of
the
founding,
and
it
would
compromise
foreign
affairs
and
national
security
interests
of
the
first
order.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
there
may
well
be.
let
me
walk
through
the
analysis
that
i
think
you'd
have
to
go
through.
first,
i
would
make
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
seems
unimaginable
that
a
convention
of
that
kind
would
be
ratified
by
two-thirds
of
the
senate,
which
it
would
have
to
be.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
that
does
go
to
the
point--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
the
framers
thought
that
the
two-thirds
guarantee
--
the
two-thirds
ratification
requirement,
was
an
important
structural
guarantee
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
there's
no
doubt
that
the
framers
thought
that
would
be
an
important
protection.
but
beyond
that,
this
court
has
said
that
--
that
there
is
an
inquiry.
it
said
in
dictum.
it
has
never
held
that
a
ratified
treaty
exceeds
--
exceeds
the
federal
government's
constitutional
authority.
it's
never
held
that
a
provision
implementing
a
ratified
treaty
exceeds
the
federal
government's
constitutional
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
my
answer
is
this:
that
the
court
has
said
that
there
is
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
--
it
is
a
proper
subject
of
a
treaty
and
that
that
inquiry
could
take
into
account
whether
it
is
imposing
a
fundamental
change
in
the
character
of
the
government.
but
that's
not
a
question
the
court
needs
to
answer
here,
because
this
treaty,
the
--
the
petitioner
concedes,
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
treaty
power,
and
the
legislation
implementing
this
treaty
is
coextensive
with
the
obligations
of
the
treaty.
there
is
no--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--all
right.
but
--
but
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
treaty
power,
and
there
is
no
daylight
between
the
implementing
legislation
and
the
obligations
that
the
petitioner
concedes
are
valid.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
therefore
--
and
therefore,
that
may
be
a
question
that
the
court
would
have
to
answer
in
a
different
case.
but
this
case
doesn't
present
the
opportunity
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
there
--
there
may
be
an
outer
bound,
but
this
case
is
nowhere
close
to
it.
and
--
and
it
isn't
--
it
can't
be
a
“
too
local
”
exception
to
the
treaty
power,
which
petitioners
argue.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
question
here
is
whether
this
legislation
validly
--
it
validly
implements
a
valid
treaty.
the
treaty
is
concededly
valid.
the
legislation
is
concededly
valid
on
its
face.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
make
a
structural
point
and
then
a
specific
point
about
this
case.
the
structural
point,
justice
scalia,
is
this:
if
it
is
the
case,
as
your
honor's
hypothetical
seems
to
concede
and
as
i
believe
petitioner
concedes,
that
a
self-executing
treaty
that
requires
the
president
to
negotiate
and
two-thirds
of
the
senate
to
ratify
it,
can
impose
an
obligation
of
that
kind,
then
it
has
to
be
the
case
that
a
non-self-executing
treaty
that
is
--
that
has
the
same
approval
of
the
president,
the
same
two-thirds
ratification,
and
the
additional
structural
protection
of
passage
of
legislation
by
the
senate
and
the
house
and
being
signed
into
law
by
the
president,
can
do
what
the
self-executing
treaty
can
do.
it
has
to
be
the
case.
the
power,
if
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
with
respect,
now
the
point
with
respect
to
this
treaty.
i
don't
think
that,
with
all
due
respect,
there
is
any
daylight
here
with
respect
to
this
treaty.
section
229(a)
does
precisely
what
the
treaty
obligates
the
united
states
government
to
do,
and
i
think
the
notion
that
the
treaty
obligation
can
be
satisfied
by
relying
on
the
states
to
enforce
their
assault
laws,
which
i
think
is
the
core
of
my
friend's
argument
here,
is
directly
contrary
to
the
history
of
the
framing--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--this
is
a
very
important
point
here,
and
it
gets
i
think
to
the
heart
of
what
the
national
interest
is
in
this
case
with
respect
to
this
treaty
and
this
implementing
legislation.
and
the
harm
inheres
in
the
process
of
line
drawing.
what
the
petitioner
is
asking
as
a
rule
of
either
constitutional
law
or
statutory
construction
is
that
courts,
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
after
the
fact
made
ad
hoc
judgments
about
whether
they--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no
--
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
can
--
we
can
talk
about
hypotheticals,
but
the
key
point
about
them
is
that
they're
hypothetical.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
vinegar
and
the
goldfish
is
not
a
real
case,
and
i
would
submit
that
de
minimis
non
curat
lex.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
i
understand
the
point.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
de
minimis
non
curat
lex
would
take
care
of
that,
but
this
--
there
is
serious
--
this
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--this
is
serious
business.
with
all
due
respect,
the
line
that
the
petitioner
is
asking--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
the
law--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
you
will
permit
me
to
answer
the
question
this
way:
the
line
that
the
petitioner
is
asking
courts
to
draw
is
whether
the
particular
use
is
warlike
or
whether
it
constitutes
a
peaceful
purpose
under
this
convention
and
under
the
implementing
statute.
well,
the
very
--
one
of
the
very
things
we
are
trying
to
sort
out
right
now
in
syria
under
the
chemical
weapons
convention
is
where
the
line
is
between
peaceful
uses
and
warlike
uses.
and
this
phrase,
“
peaceful
uses
”
is
not
only
in
the
chemical
weapons
convention,
it's
in
the
nuclear
nonproliferation
treaty,
and
we're
engaged
in
very
sensitive
negotiations
right
now
under
the
nuclear
nonproliferation
treaty
trying
to
draw
exactly
the
same
line.
and
it
would
be
terribly
unfortunate,
i
would
submit,
if
the
court
were
to
announce
in
the
context
of
this
case,
as
petitioner
is
asking,
a
definition
of
what
warlike
constitutes
that
could
have
an
unfortunate
bearing
on
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
the
--
the
--
the
framers
of
the
convention
and
congress
in
implementing
the
convention
made
a
judgment
that
there
needs
to
be
a
comprehensive
ban
and
that
you
can't
be
drawing
these
kinds
of
lines
because
you
can't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
with
respect
to
the
chemicals,
i
think
they
made
the
judgment
because
you
can't
predict
in
advance
how
chemicals
are
going
to
be
used
and
how
toxic
they
will
be
in
particular
combinations
and
how
dangerous
they
will
be
in
particular
combinations
and
therefore
you
need
a
comprehensive
definition.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
--
i
think
there
is
a
real
risk
in
courts
getting
involved
in
defining
the
line
between
warlike
and
peaceful
purposes--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
the
meaning
of
the
convention
when
the
--
when
the
convention
is
purposely
drafted
broadly.
and
there
--
there
are
additional
risks
in
terms
of
this
--
the
very
act
of
bringing
this
process
of
line-drawing
to
bear;
case-by-case,
ad
hoc
judgments
about
what
constitutes
a
violation
and
what
doesn't
is
going
to
undermine
the
ability
of
our
negotiators
into
--
to
make
treaties
in
the
future
because
they
are--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
--
what
i
think
it
would,
justice
kennedy,
would
suffice
to
decide
this
case,
were
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
“
too
local
”
limit
that
the
petitioner
is
advocating
here
as
an
as-applied,
case-by-case
“
too
local
”
limit
is
not
one
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
constitutional
structure
because
if
you
go
back
to
the
framers,
it
is
clear
from
the
era
of
the
framing
that
the
framers
intended
to
give
the
national
government
the
power
using--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--this
court
has
said
that
the
--
this
court
has
said
that,
in
dictum,
repeatedly,
but
it
has
said
that
the
--
the
treaty
--
there's
a
question
in
a
treaty
power
case
of
whether
the
subject
matter
of
the
treaty
is
a
proper
subject
for
a
treaty.
that's
a
question
the
court
can
ask.
and
--
and
although
i'm
not
prepared
to
draw
a
specific
line
here
today,
there
--
there
may
well
be
a
line
to
be
drawn.
but
here,
the
petitioner
has
conceded
and
i
think
all
of
us
would
agree,
this
is
the
proper
subject
of
the
treaty.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
the
--
if
the
treaty
--
well,
the
way
i
would
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
if
the
treaty
is
valid--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--then
implementing
legislation
that
doesn't
go
beyond
the
treaty
is
valid
even
if
it
addresses
a
subject
that
would
otherwise
be
within
the
police
power
of
the
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
the
judgment
the
framers
made
and
that's
what
--
that's
this
case.
and
so,
because
the
treaty
is
valid,
the
petitioner's
concede
that
the
treaty
is
valid,
this
statute
implements
the
treaty
word-for-word
implementation
of
the
obligations
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
because
it
is
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
treaty
is
valid,
and
the
petitioner
hasn't
elaborated
any
argument
or
any
principle
that
would
allow
this
court
to
make
a
judgment
about
when
an
exercise
of
the
treaty
power
is
valid
and
when
it
isn't,
that
you've
got
to
take
as
a
given
in
this
case
that
the
treaty
is
valid.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so
there
is
a
structure
of
limitations,
you
know,
as
i
said
earlier.
the
two-thirds
ratification
requirement
is
real
with
respect
to
this.
one
of
the
treaties
your
honor
just
referred
to,
the
u.n.
convention
on
civil
and
political
rights,
of
course,
when
the
senate
ratified
it,
it
did
use
its
power
to
make
reservations
to
preserve
our
federal
system.
so
that
operated
in
exactly
the
manner
that
the
framers
intended
there
to
protect,
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
federalism.
and
there
are,
you
know,
there
are
about
1,000
ratified
treaties
on
the
books
right
now
and
we
don't
have
the
congress
using
the
treaty
power
to
--
to
usurp
the
role
of
the
states--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
doubt
that,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--nobody
--
no
--
nobody
would
--
we're
not
saying
--
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
that
--
that
whether
or
not
ms.
bond
is
prosecuted
would
give
rise
to
an
international
incident.
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
the
authority
to
pass
a
comprehensive
ban.
now,
there
may,
of
course,
be
applications
of
that
comprehensive
ban
that
don't
advance
the
national
interest
in
a
profound
or
poignant
way;
we
understand
that.
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
pass
a
comprehensive
ban
implementing
a
treaty.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
right.
and
that
--
and
that's
true,
it's
--
and
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
this
convention
is
a
convention
that
all
but
four
nations
on
earth
have
signed.
the
legislation
that
we
have
enacted
is
model
legislation
that
over
120
other
nations
have
enacted
as
well.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that.
i
think
that
--
because
i
don't
think
it
would
be
--
the
question
would
be:
what
does
the
treaty
power
encompass?
it
wouldn't
be
a
circumvention
if
this
is
something
that
could
be
constitutionally
done
under
the
treaty
power,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
the
question
in
that
case
would
be
whether
the
treaty
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
treaty
power.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
understand
the
point,
justice
breyer,
i
do.
i
understand
that
there
is
something
that
seemed
attractive
to
think
about
this
as
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
it's
not
as
easy
as
it
seems,
that
there
are
real
risks
to
trying
to
draw
a
line
of
that
kind.
and
yes,
that
does
--
i
understand
that.
that
does
raise
the
stakes
some,
i
understand
that.
but
i
think
that
risk
is
real,
and
i
think
that
risk
is
real,
the
risk
that
the
state
department
legal
advisor's
brief
pointed
out
is
real
of
undermining
our
ability--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
a
historical
answer
to
that
question,
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
that
that's
how
the
framers
understood
it.
i
think
that's
clear
from
what
hamilton
said
in
the
--
in
the
quotes
that
we
have
in
our
brief,
and
others
of
the
framers
understood
that
that's
where
the
line
would
be.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
treaty
power
is
itself
a
great
and
substantial
independent
power
of
the
national
government.
and
it
is
not
constrained
by
a
“
too
local
”
limitation.
that
is
the
lesson
of
the
era
of
the
framing,
that
there
is
a
not
a
“
too
local
”
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
the
treaty
power.
and
therefore,
while--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--your
honor,
so
long
as
the
treaty
--
it's
a
valid
exercise
of
the
treaty
power,
i
think
a
fortiori
if
all
you
do
is
implement
the
treaty
in
haec
verba,
it's
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power.
and
i
will
say,
i
said
earlier
that
this
is
serious
business.
i
understand
that
principles
of
federalism
are
serious
business
also,
but
federalism
is
a
two-way
street.
and
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
treaty
power,
the
framers
made
a
judgment
that
this
power
was
going
to
be
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
national
government.
and
it
needed
to
be
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
national
government
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
united
states
could
be
a
full
sovereign
on
the
world
stage.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
subject
matter
of
treaties
is
different
now
than
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
but
the
framers
understood
that.
they
were
careful
not
to
impose
subject
matter
limitations
on
the
treaty
power
because
they
were
wise
enough
to
know
they
could
not
foresee
what
might
be
important
for
the
united
states
to
be
able
to
negotiate
about
on
a
world
stage
in
order
to
participate
fully
as
a
sovereign.
and
the
chemical
weapons
convention
is
a
deeply
apt
illustration
of
exactly
why
the
framers
were
wise
in
ensuring
that
there
were
not
subject
matter
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
the
treaty
power.
the
chemical
weapons
convention
--
the
united
states'
leadership
in
the
chemical
weapons
convention
has
made
a
big
difference
in
ensuring
that
this
norm,
which
is
in
our
national
interests,
our
foreign
relations
interests,
and
our
national
security
interest,
is
a
norm
that
the
nations
of
the
world
have
agreed
to
and
that
we
are
then
in
a
position
to
have
leverage
to
insist
that
the
nations
of
the
world
abide
by
it.
it
is
leverage
we
are
trying
to
exercise
right
now.
it
is
critically
important,
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
line
that
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
draw
is
not
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
framers,
with
this
court's
precedent
or
with
the
national
interests
that
i
have
described.
thank
you.
