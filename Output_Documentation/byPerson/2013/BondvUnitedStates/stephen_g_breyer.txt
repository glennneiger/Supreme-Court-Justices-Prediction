justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
chemical
used
here
one
of
the
chemicals
that's
listed
in
the
annex
to
the
treaty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
that's
the
part
that
i
can't
yet
get
my
mind
to
these
dramatic
questions
of
whether
here
the
local
police
power
or
in
some
other
case
some
other
inherently
state
power
make
a
treaty
beyond
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
enter
into.
it's
a
very
big
question.
but
i'm
not
there
yet.
and
the
reason
i'm
not
there
is
because
there's
some
words
in
this
treaty
called
“
other
peaceful
purpose
”,
and
we
have
to
interpret
those
words
and
the
same
words
are
in
the
statute.
and
my
question
to
you
is:
what
reason
is
there
to
think
that
those
matters
on
list
a
fall
within
those
words?
what
is
list
a?
it's
infinitely
long.
a
few
things
on
it
are
in
holmes'
opinion
in
peasley,
a
great
case
on
attempted
murder
where
he
talks
about
paying
a
small
boy
to
move
a
barrel
of
kerosene
with
a
candle
in
it
alit,
so
that
it
will
burn
down
a
barn
after
a
few
hours.
the
kerosene
is
a
chemical.
he
talks
about
a
case
where
a
person
went
to
a
racetrack
and
gave
a
horse
a
poison
potato.
he
talks
about
a
case
involving
somebody
else
trying
to
light
a
match,
which
is
a
chemical,
and
setting
fire
to
a
haystack.
we
can
all
think
sadly
of
athletes,
lance
armstrong,
at
least
accused
of
unlawfully
taking
drugs.
i
mean,
why
do
we
think
matters
of
list
a
fall
within
those
words,
outside
the
words
“
other
peaceful
purpose
”,
even
though
they're
unlawful?
and
by
the
way,
did
anyone
say
to
the
drafters
of
the
convention
--
i
found
nothing
in
this
brief
on
the
point
--
or
did
anyone
tell
congress
that
poison
potatoes,
drug-enhancing,
performance-enhancing
drugs,
the
example
that
justice
alito
used
last
time,
you
give
vinegar
to
a
goldfish
--
i
mean,
these
are
all
chemicals
not
in
the
annex,
but
they
are
chemicals.
and
they
are
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
chemical
weapons.
and
why
do
we
think
that
we
have
to
get
beyond
that
fact?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there's
an
easy
way
out
of
that.
all
we
do
is
say
the
chemicals
involved
are
the
chemicals
in
the
annex.
but
you're
not
prepared
to
say
that,
i
guarantee
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
we're
outside
the
annex.
and
i
guess
once
we
get
outside
the
annex,
we
either
have
to
draw
lines
or
we
have
to
say,
well,
this
encompasses
the
poison
potato,
the
poisoned
goldfish,
the
small
boy
with
the
candle,
the
--
for
performance-enhancing
drugs.
i
would
say
judges
are
here
to
draw
lines,
and
between
throwing
all
those
things
into
it
or
drawing
lines,
it's
better
to
draw
a
few
lines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
these
are
real
cases,
by
the
way.
the
poison
potato
was
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there's
chocolate
all
over
the
place.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
--
i
want
your
answer
to
the
line
--
my
question
was
a
question
to
get
your
answer.
and
the
answer
that
i
wanted
you
to
address
yourself
to
is
the
problem
of
once
you
depart
from
the
annexes
in
defining
the
chemicals,
you
throw
into
it
a
list
a
thousand
miles
long.
and
we
can
tell
joke
after
joke,
but
it's
not
a
joke
that
it's
so
easy
to
make
up
examples
that
seem
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
of
chemical
weapons
like
the
syrian
problem,
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your
answer?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
you
tell
us
--
can
you
tell
us
what
the
line
is
that
we're
trying
to
draw?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
look,
also
if
you'
telling
me
i
am
attempting
to
draw
the
line.
that's
just
what
i
was
going
to
do.
and
if
you're
saying
it's
against
the
national
security
interest,
which
is
the
first
time
i've
heard
that,
that
it
is
the
national
interests
--
against
the
national
interests
of
the
united
states
for
me
to
attempt
to
draw
such
a
line,
then
i
guess
the
state
department
better
file
a
brief
explaining
why
or
you
ought
--
or
why
you
--
why
you
want
to
push
this
case
or
--
i
mean,
i'm
--
is
that
what
you're
telling
me,
that
if
i
write
the
opinion
that
i
think
the
law
requires
me
to
write
that
i
somehow
am
hurting
the
national
security
interests
of
the
united
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
the
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
no.
that
isn't
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it
is.
that
is
the
problem.
there
is
an
underlying
--
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off,
but
at
some
point
you
seem
not
to
see
a
problem
that
i
think
i
see.
and
the
problem
underlying
it,
if
you
get
into
the
treaty
area
is
this:
given
the
power,
as
there
is
in
medellin's
majority,
to
have
some
self-executing
treaties,
in
principle
your
position
constitutionally
would
allow
the
president
and
the
senate,
not
the
house,
to
do
anything
through
a
treaty
that
is
not
specifically
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
rights
protections
of
the
constitution.
that's
missouri
v.
holland.
and
i
doubt
that
in
that
document
the
framers
intended
to
allow
the
president
and
the
senate
to
do
anything.
now,
you
ask
us
now
to
say
whether
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes
or
no.
we
still
have
a
democracy,
in
other
words,
of
which
the
house
is
part.
now,
if
you
carry
it
to
an
extreme,
that's
what
you
are,
that's
where
you
are,
and
i
am
worried
about
that
and
i
think
others
are,
too.
so
i
had
asked
you:
isn't
there
an
easier
way
to
deal
with
this
case?
and
you
tell
me:
no,
no,
because
we
will
interfere
with
some
problem
of
foreign
affairs
that
was
never
mentioned
in
any
brief,
or
at
least
hit
me
for
the
first
time
when
you
said
it.
now,
there
you
have
an
expression
of
my
uncertainties
at
the
moment,
and
any
way
you
want
to
reply
to
that
would
be
helpful.
