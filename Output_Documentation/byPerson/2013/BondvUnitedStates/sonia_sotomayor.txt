justice

mr.
clement,
why
not?
meaning
there
--
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
chemical
weaponry
is
at
the
forefront
of
our
foreign
policy
efforts
right
now.
look
at
the
syria
situation
alone.
it
would
be
deeply
ironic
that
we
have
expended
so
much
energy
criticizing
syria,
when
if
this
court
were
now
to
declare
that
our
joining
or
creating
legislation
to
implement
the
treaty
was
unconstitutional.
we're
putting
aside
the
impact
that
we
could
have
on
foreign
relations.
why
is
it,
if
it's
okay
to
regulate
the
possession
of
marijuana,
a
purely
local
crime,
why
is
it
unconstitutional
to
regulate
the
use
of
something
that
can
kill
or
maim
another
human
being?
a
chemical
that
can
kill
or
maim
another
human
being?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand
where
the
disconnect
is
in
terms
of
our
federal
or
state
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
this
saying,
there's
no
dispute
that
these
chemicals
were
transported
against
--
along
interstate
lines.
that's
not
even
disputed
in
this
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
we
permit
that
in
all
sorts
of
definitional
sections
of
the
criminal
code.
we
call
a
dangerous
weapon
anything
that
you
use
to
inflict
serious
injury
on
someone.
i
don't
think
of
a
car
as
necessarily
a
dangerous
weapon.
it
is
something
i
use
to
transport
myself.
it's
only
when
i'm
using
it
for
a
prohibited
purpose
that
it
turns
itself
into
a
dangerous
weapon.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i'm
--
i'm
having
a
problem
with
this
noun-verb
distinction.
why
isn't
the
intentional
burning,
killing
of
another
human
being
using
chemicals
the
essence
of
what
this
treaty
is
trying
to
stop?
i
thought
that's
what
it
was
trying
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
to
add
on
the
war-like
purposes.
but
the
treaty
permits
exceptions
for
any
peaceful
purpose.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
treaty
power.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
was
said
in
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
if
a
terrorist
took
these
chemicals
and
put
it
on
every
doorknob
in
boston,
that
wouldn't
be
regulated
by
this
or
--
the
very
exact
same
chemicals.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
it's
war-like.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
now
we
have--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
her
child
had
died--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
clear
statement
about
the
treaty
--
i'm
sorry.
