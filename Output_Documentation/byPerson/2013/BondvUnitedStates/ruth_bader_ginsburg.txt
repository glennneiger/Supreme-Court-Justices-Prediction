but,
mr.
clement,
you
said
that
--
that
the
treaty
is
valid
and
the
implementing
legislation
seems
to
largely
copy
the
words
of
the
treaty
without
adding
anything.
so,
it's
a
puzzle
that
the
treaty
could
be
constitutional,
but
the
implementing
legislation
that
adds
nothing
is
unconstitutional.

mr.
clement,
there's
an
irony
in
what
you
just
said,
because
the
victim,
many
times,
went
to
the
state
police
and
said,
please
help
me.
and
they
turned
her
away
a
dozen
times.
and
finally
they
said,
go
to
the
post
office.
so
this
doesn't
seem
to
be
--
you're
arguing
that
this
trenches
on
the
state's
domain.
and,
yet,
in
this
very
case,
it
wasn't
until
the
state
referred
her
to
the
post
office,
federal
officials,
that
she
got
any
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
before
your
time
is
out,
you
haven't
answered
directly
why
the
bill
of
rights
does
constrain
the
treaty
power,
the
implementation
of
it,
reid
v.
colbert?
why
is
the
bill
of
rights
different
from
the
federalism
concern
that
the
court
has
expressed
in
many
cases,
when
you
say,
yes,
there
is
a
check,
the
bill
of
rights
is
a
check,
but
not
the
tenth
amendment?
