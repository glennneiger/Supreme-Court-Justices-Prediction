justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
don't
you
think
the
word
“
treaty
”
has
some
meaning?
it
is
certainly
true
that
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
country,
there
have
been
many
treaties
that
have
been
implemented
in
ways
that
affect
matters
that
otherwise
would
be
within
the
province
of
the
states.
one
of
the
original
purposes
of
--
objectives
of
the
constitution
was
to
deal
with
--
with
a
treaty
power
was
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
debts
owed
to
british
creditors.
and
there
have
been
cases
about
the
property
rights
of
--
of
foreign
subjects,
about
the
treatment
of
foreign
subjects
here,
about
things
that
are
moving
across
international
borders,
about
extradition
and
all
of
those.
but
in
all
of
those,
until
fairly
recently,
certainly
until
generally
after
world
war
ii,
all
of
those
concerned
matters
that
are
of
legitimate
concern
of
a
foreign
state.
that
was
the
purpose
of
a
treaty.
so
can't
we
see
something
in
that,
in
the
meaning
of
a
treaty,
what
it
was
understood
to
mean
when
the
constitution
was
adopted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
do
you
think
it
would
be
difficult--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--do
you
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
judge
to
ask,
is
there
any
possibility
that
there
is
any
other
country
in
the
world
that
has
the
slightest
interest
in
how
the
united
states
or
any
of
its
subdivisions
deals
with
the
particular
situation
that's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
would
be
beyond
the
--
that
would
be
beyond
the
ability
of
federal
judges
when
they
--
when
a
case
like
this
comes
before
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they're
not
real
--
they're
not
real
cases
because
you
haven't
prosecuted
them
yet.
[laughter]
if
you
told
ordinary
people
that
you
were
going
to
prosecute
ms.
bond
for
using
a
chemical
weapon,
they
would
be
flabbergasted.
it's
--
it
--
it's
so
far
outside
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
statute
has
an
enormous
--
an
enormous
breadth,
anything
that
can
cause
death
or
injury
to
a
person
or
an
animal.
would
it
shock
you
if
i
told
you
that
a
few
days
ago
my
wife
and
i
distributed
toxic
chemicals
to
a
great
number
of
children?
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
halloween
we
gave
them
chocolate
bars.
chocolate
is
poison
to
dogs,
so
it's
a
toxic
chemical
under
the
chemical
weapons--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--whenever
--
when
this
court
has
issued
decisions
in
recent
years
holding
that
there
are
some
limits
on
congress's
power,
cases
like
lopez
and
morrison
and
city
of
boerne,
there
have
been
legal
commentators
who
have
written
articles
saying
that
could
be
circumvented
to
--
through
the
use
of
the
treaty
power.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
--
all
right.
i'll
take
back
the
word
“
circumvention
”.
could
you
reach
the
opposite
result?
could
it
--
could
congress
regulate
the
possession
of
a
gun
within
a
school
zone
by
entering
into
a
treaty
that
authorizes
such
legislation?
