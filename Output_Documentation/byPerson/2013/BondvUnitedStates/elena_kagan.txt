but
the
convention
--
but
the
convention
tells
the
state
parties,
go
regulate
individual
conduct
in
exactly
the
way
that
this
convention
regulates
state
parties.
and
then
what
the
legislation
does
is,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
just
mirror
the
convention
as
the
convention
contemplated.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
--
do
you
think,
mr.
clement,
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
could
the
--
could
this
treaty
have
itself
regulated
individual
conduct?
could
the
treaty
have
been
self-executing?
justice
elena
kagan
where
would
you
find
that
in
the
constitution?
because
there's
clearly
a
treaty
power
that
does
not
have
subject
matter
limitations.
and,
indeed,
if
you
go
back
to
the
founding
history,
it's
very
clear
that
they
thought
about
all
kinds
of
subject
matter
limitations
and
james
madison
and
others
decided,
quite
self-consciously,
not
to
impose
them.
so
where
would
you
find
that
limitation
in
the
constitution?
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
isn't
an
enumerated
power.
the
enumerated
power
is
the
treaty
power.
so
you
have
to
find
a
constraint
on
the
treaty
power.
where
does
it
come
from?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
could
i
make
sure
i
understand
your
test?
your
test
is
to
say
that
with
respect
to
every
prosecution
under
this
--
under
this
treaty,
that
a
court
has
to
ask
whether
the
prosecution
has
a
sufficient
nexus
to
national
or
international
concerns?
is
that
--
is
that
your
test?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
i'm
still
looking
for
a
test
and
i
thought
that
the
test
that
i
just
articulated
was
really
directly
out
of
your
briefs.
but
if
it's
--
but
if
--
if
you're
suggesting
that
that's
not
the
test,
give
me
the
test
that
we're
supposed
to
ask
with
respect
to
this
case
or
any
other
as
to
whether
the
prosecution
is
unconstitutional.
justice
elena
kagan
that
sounds
like
a
facial
challenge.
now,
i
thought
that
you
made
very
careful
to
talk
about
that
this
was
an
as-applied
challenge
to
this
particular
prosecution.
justice
elena
kagan
so
you're
saying
if
the
statute
extends
to
things
that
we've
generally
thought
of
as
part
of
the
police
power,
that's
sufficient.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
nexus,
nexus
to
a
national
concern,
again,
is
what
i
understood
you
to
say
in
your
brief.
but
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
and
you
tell
me
whether
your
test
meets
it.
let's
say
it's
the
same
convention
except
it
relates
only
to
sarin
gas,
and
--
and
there's
a
chemist
out
there
and,
you
know,
the
--
the
implementing
legislation
mirrors
the
convention.
there's
a
chemist
out
there
who
manufactures
sarin
gas
--
i
take
it
it's
pretty
easy
to
manufacture
--
and
sends
it
through
the
ducts
of
a
house
and
kills
everybody
in
it.
does
that
have
a
nexus
to
national
concerns?
justice
elena
kagan
so
but
this
is
--
in
my
hypothetical
--
and
you
didn't
run
away
from
it
at
all;
i
applaud
that.
in
my
hypothetical,
it's
a
completely
domestic
use.
you
know,
it's
just
this
chemist
didn't
like
his
neighbor
and
used
sarin
gas.
and
you're
saying
what
the
difference
is,
well,
what
the
treaty
makers
did
was
to
find
the
category
of
chemicals
more
broadly.
and
i
guess
what
i
want
to
know
is,
you
are
imagining
a
world
in
which
judges
day
to
day
try
to
get
inside
the
head
of
treaty
makers
to
think
about,
you
know,
in
this
case
we
understand
that
there's
a
national
interest
in
regulating
sarin
gas,
but
we
don't
think
that
there's
a
sufficient
interest
in
regulating
some
other
chemical
or
some
other
chemical
or
so
on
down
the
line.
it
seems
to
me
a
completely
indeterminate
test
and
one
that
would
have
judges
take
the
place
of
treaty
makers
in
terms
of
deciding
what
is
in
the
national
and
international
interest.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but,
mr.
clement,
it's
absolutely
clear
that
the
treaty
was
after
enforcement
as
to
individuals
with
respect
to
all
the
prohibitions,
that
the
treaty
said:
go
enforce
this
as
to
individuals
and
do
it
consistent
with
your
constitutional
processes.
and
then
congress
passes
a
law
that
is
consistent
with
its
constitutional
processes,
and
it
completely
mirrors
the
treaty.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
why.
i
mean,
holmes
dealt
with
this
in
missouri
v.
holland.
he
says
there's
a
treaty
power,
it's
an
enumerated
power,
there's
a
necessary
and
proper
clause
that
functions
to
--
to
allow
congress
to
give
effect
to
that
treaty
power.
it's
--
you
know,
this
is
a
--
a
situation
where
there's
a
prohibition
on
the
states
in
terms
of
entering
into
treaties
or
in
terms
of
sharing
that
power
in
any
way.
and
he
says,
you
know,
it's
just
these
invisible
radiations
that
you
think
come
from
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
and
he
specifically
rejected
this
argument,
the
same
argument
that
you're
making,
the
penumbras
and
emanations
of
the
constitution.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
general,
could
i
ask
why
that
is?
i
mean,
because
this
--
this
convention
and
the
implementing
legislation
is
very
broad
and
it's
broad
because
it
applies
to
a
very
large
category
of
weapons
and
it
applies
to
a
very
large
category
of
uses,
of
conduct.
so
what
were
they
thinking
about,
about
why
they
wanted
these
very
broad
categories,
why
it's
not
more
limited
with
respect
either
to
the
chemicals
or
to
the
conduct?
justice
elena
kagan
and,
general,
don't
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
almost
all
of
the
legal
counsels
of
the
state
department,
republican
and
democrat,
talking
about
how
if
petitioner's
argument
were
accepted,
it
would
severely
damage
the
united
states'
ability
to
enter
into
and
to
negotiate
treaties.
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
just
ask
you,
mr.
clement,
and
it's
a
variant
of
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
before,
but
it
focuses
more
on
your
statutory
point,
the
peaceful
purposes.
suppose
that
ms.
bond
used
sarin
gas
and
sent
it
through
the
ducts
of
haynes'
house;
would
you
say
that
that's
a
peaceful
purpose?
