chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-158,
bond
v.
united
states.
mr.
clement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
let's
suppose
there's
a
multilateral
treaty,
the
--
the
international
convention
to
ensure
that
national
legislatures
have
full
authority
to
carry
out
their
obligations,
i.e.,
that
the
national
legislature
has
the
police
power.
and
congress
passes
a
statute
saying
we
have
the
authority
to
prosecute
purely
local
crimes
pursuant
to
this
international
convention
that
the
president
has
signed.
any
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
just
to
press
it
further,
the
--
the
point
is
that
it's
a
transfer
of
authority
from
the
states
to
the
national
legislature.
i
don't
know
why
you'd
look
to
the
national
legislature
to
say,
well,
we'd
never
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
a
time
when
the
senate
was
elected
by
the
state
legislatures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
it
would
not
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
treaty
power.
a
case
like
medellin
caused
serious
conflict
with
our
international
obligations
because
we
held,
look,
the
federal
government
does
not
have
the
authority
to
tell
the
sheriff
in
texas
what
to
do.
that
caused
a
great
deal
of
strain
in
--
in
our
international
relations.
and
i
think
the
united
nations
could
well
say,
look,
we
don't
want
treaty
parties
to
have
to
deal
with
whether
it's
somebody
in
this
state
or
somebody
in
that
province
who
has
the
authority,
so
every
signatory
must
have
the
authority.
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
not
reasonably
related
to
international
obligations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know
your
--
i
know
the
case--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
the
--
the
purpose
of
my
hypothetical
was
try
to
find
out
if
there's
any
situation
in
which
you
believe
an
erosion
or
intrusion
by
the
federal
government
on
the
police
power
could
be
a
constraint
against
an
international
treaty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
say
there
may
be
an
outer
bound
but
this
case
isn't
one
of
them,
you're
subjecting
yourself
to
the
same
criticisms
that
have
been
leveled
against
the
other
side,
that
you're
proposing
a
case-by-case
evaluation
with
respect
to
each
treaty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
treaties,
particularly
i
think
justice
alito
pointed
out,
after
the
world
war
ii
era
where
you
have
international
conventions
affecting
everything.
we
have
international
conventions
on
the
abduction
of
children,
international
conventions
that
--
human
rights.
they
cover
a
vast
swath
of
--
of
subject
matter.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
only
thing
you're
saying
that
is
a
limit
on
what
the
treaty
power
can
be
as
a
source
for
is
some
determination,
no
more
--
less
--
no
less
arbitrary
than
the
lines
other
people
are
asking
us
to
draw
between
what's
appropriate
under
the
treaty
power
and
what's
not.
and
i
just
would
like
a
fairly
precise
answer
whether
there
are
or
are
not
limitations
on
what
congress
can
do
with
respect
to
the
police
power.
if
their
authority
is
asserted
under
a
treaty,
is
their
--
is
their
power
to
intrude
upon
the
police
power
unlimited?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
the
treaty
is
valid.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
rather
have
the
court
determine,
if
we're
concerned
about
the
intrusion
on
the
police
power,
whether
treaties
are
valid
or
not
than
whether
--
determine
whether
particular
implementing
legislation
is
valid
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
this
case.
the
point
of
the
hypothetical
is
i'm
trying
to
get
your
general
principle.
i
can
imagine
treaties
that
you
would
say
are
within
the
treaty
power,
again,
particularly
in
the
post-world
war
ii
era,
but
that
could
give
rise
to
implementing
legislation
that
i
think
would
be
extraordinary
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
framers
and
the
power
that
it
gave
congress
to
intrude
upon
state
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
--
it's
kind
of
question
begging.
i
mean,
the
whole
point
is
that
some
people
think
we
do
have
exactly
that
in
this
case.
now,
usually
when
we
have
a
case
that
implicates
significant
and
serious
bilateral
concerns,
we
get
a
lot
of
briefs
and
all
that
from
our
--
our
treaty
partners.
is
--
is
there
any
concern
that's
been
expressed
in
any
concrete
way
by
them
about
whether
mrs.
bond
is
prosecuted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
yes.
so
nothing
in--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sure
that
the
people
who've
worked
in
the
national
branch
of
government,
particularly
for
the
state
department,
would
like
to
have
as
much
authority
as
they
can
get
to
negotiate
treaties.
we're
concerned
about
limitations
on
other.
do
we
have
any
briefs
from
state
legislatures,
state
authorities,
concerning
intrusion
on
their
prerogatives?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
clement,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
