mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
statute
at
issue
here
really
does
reach
every
malicious
use
of
chemicals
anywhere
in
the
nation,
as
the
government
insists,
then
it
clearly
exceeds
congress's
limited
and
enumerated
powers.
this
court's
cases
have
made
clear
that
it
is
a
bedrock
principle
of
our
federalist
system
that
congress
lacks
a
general
police
power
to
criminalize
conduct
without
regard
to
a
jurisdictional
element
or
some
nexus
to
a
matter
of
distinctly
federal
concern.
the
president's
negotiation
and
the
senate's
ratification
of
a
treaty
with
a
foreign
nation
does
not
change
that
bedrock
principle
of
our
constitutional
system.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
guess
i
would
quarrel
with
your
premise,
which
is,
it
is
true
that
the
convention
in
the
statute
used
similar
terms
and
terminology,
but
there's
one
very
important
difference
between
the
convention
and
the
statute
and
that
actually
differentiates
this
case
from
missouri
vs.
holland.
and
that
difference
is
that
the
convention
itself
doesn't
directly
regulate
individual
conduct
at
all.
and
so
all
the
--
all
the
convention
does--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kagan,
to
be
quite
precise,
though,
what
the
convention
says
--
and
this
is
article
7,
section
1,
it's
33-a
of
the
blue
brief
appendix.
what
it
says
is
that
each
nation
state
that
signs
the
convention
agrees
in
accordance
with
its
constitutional
processes
to
pass
penal
laws
that
make
unlawful
for
individuals
conduct
that
would
violate
the
convention
if
undertaken
by
a
nation
state.
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
making
that
translation,
if
you
will,
between
what
violates
the
convention
if
you're
a
nation
state
and
what
would
be
comparable
individual
conduct
is
not
obvious.
and
when
the
government
does
that
through
penal
legislation,
there's
no
reason
why
that
penal
legislation
shouldn't
have
to
comply--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--as
we
promised
with
our--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
it
really
gets
down
to
the
difference
between
raich
on
the
one
hand
and
lopez
on
the
other,
which
as
this
court
has
held,
that
it
is
a
classic
and
rational
way
to
regulate
commerce
to
basically
prohibit
certain
items
from
commerce.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
i
don't
think
it
was
really
disputed
in
lopez
that
the
firearm
would
have
had
to
cross
state
lines.
but
the
problem
in
lopez
was
the
federal
statute
was
not
structured
in
a
way
that
had
a
jurisdictional
nexus
that
made
the
statute
only
applicable
as
a
regulation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
and
we
do
think
that
the
government,
like
a
private
party,
can
waive
a
constitutional
argument.
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
say
that
we're
not
particularly
concerned
about
the
commerce
clause
argument
because
we
think
the
commerce
clause
argument
has
the
same
basic
defect
as
the
treaty
power
argument,
which
is
that
the
police--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
that's
an
interesting
question,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
answer
it.
i
mean,
i
would
take
the
position
that
if
there
really
were
a
self-executing
treaty
that
tried
to
impose
criminal
prohibitions,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
treaty
like
that,
but
if
there
were
one,
i
would
say
here
that
it
violates
the
constitution
for
the
same
basic
reasons
that
this
implementing
legislation
does.
but
i
--
but
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
find
that
limitation
in
the
structural
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
the
enumerated
powers
of
congress.
and
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
very--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
where
that
it
would
come
from,
again,
is
the
structural
provisions
of
the
constitution.
if
we
had
a
self-executing
treaty
that
purported
at
a
national
level
to
commandeer
state
and
local
police
officers,
i
would
think
that
there
might
be
--
you
could
call
it
a
tenth
amendment
objection,
we
could
call
it
an
enumerated
power
objection.
there
might
be
an
objection
to
that
treaty.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
right,
justice
alito.
and
i
didn't
mean
in
answering
justice
kagan's
question
to
fully
accept
the
premise
that
there's
no
limit
on
the
treaty
power
whatsoever.
but
i
do
think
that
it's
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
context
of
non-self-executing
treaties,
there's
a
real
opportunity
to
leave
for
another
day
the
question
of
whether
the
treaty
itself
is
valid,
because
sometimes
a
treaty
is
non-self-executing
precisely
because
the
senate
recognizes--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
absolutely
not,
justice
kennedy,
but
that's
precisely
because
it's
a
valid
non-self-executing
treaty.
by
its
terms,
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
direct
--
directly
regulate
individual
conduct.
and
if
i
were
the
president's
counsel,
i
would
have
said,
honestly,
mr.
president,
i
don't
think
this
requires
us
to
have
any
law
that
applies
to
garden
variety
assaults
with
chemicals.
but
if
we
need
that
to
discharge
our
treaty
obligations,
the
states
are
absolutely
ready
and
able
to
shoulder
that
task.
there's
no
state
in
this
country
that
doesn't
have
a
general
assault
statute
that
would
be
covered
by
this
conduct.
there
is
no
state
that
doesn't
have
a
murder
statute
to
cover
this
conduct--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
one
way
to
understand
that
is
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
exercised
its
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
pursue
this
matter.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
even
think
the
government
says
that
that
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
put
us
in
violation
of
our
treaty
obligations.
our
treaty
obligation,
at
most,
is
to
have
a
law
that
prohibits
this
conduct,
which
the
states
certainly
do.
the
treaty
obligation
is
not
to
make
sure
that
every
single
use
--
malicious
use
of
chemicals
is,
in
fact,
prosecuted
by
the
state
or
local
officials.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that's
not
my
test,
justice
kagan.
i
would
actually
come
at
it
from
the
other
end
of
the
stick,
which
is
to
say,
that
the
one
thing
i
think
i
know
from
this
court's
precedence
is
that
the
federal
government
doesn't
have
a
general
police
power.
so
as
i
look
at
this
statute,
it
can
either
be
saved
by
essentially
creating
a
jurisdictional
element
out
of
the
phrase
“
peaceful
”
and
equating
it
with
non-war-like
or,
if
the
statute
has
this
general
character,
then
at
least
as
applied
to
the
chemicals
here,
which
are
pure
dual
use
chemicals,
it
can't
be
constitutionally
applied.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it's
whether
the
federal
statute
exercises
a
general
police
power.
and
if
it
does--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
that's
because
the
only
relief
i'm
seeking
is
to
have
my
client's
conviction
vacated.
so
this
is
the
classic
as-applied
challenge.
now,
the
reasoning
that
the
court
may
employ
in
vindicating
my
as-applied
challenge
may
suggest
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
some
or
all
of
different
applications,
but
our
claim
has
always
been
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
say
that
if
a
federal
statute
exercises
the
police
power,
by
which
i
mean
it
criminalizes
conduct
without
regard
to
jurisdictional
element
or
some
nexus
to
a
matter
of
distinctly
federal
concern,
then
that
statute
exceeds
congress's
power.
that
was
the
case
in
lopez;
that
was
the
case
in
morrison.
and
i
think
unless
you
accept
our
narrowing
construction,
that's
the
case
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
does,
your
honor,
and
it
would
be
valid
legislation
precisely
because
sarin
is
something
that
clearly
congress
could
prohibit
in
all
its
uses.
and
as
i
understand
how
this
statute
applies
to
sarin
gas
or
other
things
certainly
on
schedule
i
--
there
are
some
schedule
i
substances
that
are
talked
about
both
in
the
convention
and
the
treaty
--
those
things
are
always
unlawful.
what
is
particularly
unusual
about
the
statute's
application
to
something
like
potassium
dichromate
or
vinegar
or
whatever
you
have
is
that
in
most
of
its
possession
and
uses
it's
perfectly
lawful,
and
what
makes
it
a
chemical
weapon
in
the
government's
theory
is
when
it's
used
purely
intrastate
in
a
malicious
way.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
i
would
beg
to
differ.
i
actually
think
that
our
approach
to
this
case
avoids
judges
being
put
in
that
difficult
position,
precisely
because
we
distinguish,
unlike
the
government,
between
the
validity
of
the
convention
and
the
validity
of
the
implementing
legislation.
and
then
as
to
the
implementing
legislation,
we
simply
ask
the
courts
to
do
what
they
do
in
every
other
context,
which
is
to
check
and
see
if
that
implementing
legislation
is
consistent
with
our
basic
chartering
document.
and
it's
the
government's
position,
which
i
don't
really
understand
why
this
would
work,
but
their
theory
is
if
that
the
non-self-executing
treaty
is
valid,
then
the
implementing
legislation
is
ipso
facto
somehow
valid.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
think
about
the
convention
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
medellin
case,
the
vienna
convention
on
consular
notification.
it
puts
an
obligation
on
any
arresting
official
to
provide
notification
to
the
consulate
about
an
arrested
foreign
national.
now,
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
perfectly
rational
way
to
implement
that
convention
to
have
a
national
police
force
and
so
every
arresting
officer
is
a
federal
officer
who's
fully
apprised
of
the
vienna
convention
responsibilities.
that
would
be
a
rational
way
to
implement
the
treaty,
but
it
wouldn't
be
remotely
consistent
with
our
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
that
same
valid
non-self-executing
treaty
can
be
validly
implemented
by
chartering
the
state
department
to
work
with
police
officers
on
a
state
and
local
level
to
understand
their
obligations.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
alito,
i
think
that
would
be
one
way
of
approaching
the
question.
i
think
that
would
be
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
beyond
their
ability.
i
also
don't
think
it
would
be
beyond
--
beyond
the
ability
of
a
federal
judge
to
say,
okay,
let's
hypothetically
ask
the
question
in
the
absence
of
a
non-self-executing
treaty,
would
congress
have
the
power
to
pass
this
statute?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
then
i
think
the
burden
sort
of
shifts
to
figure
out
why
it
is
that
the
treaty
adds
something
to
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
and
i
think
this,
just
to
make
clear,
i
think
this
is
a
very
different
context
from
what
the
court
had
in
missouri
v.
holland,
because
there
the
treaty
itself
prohibited
individual
action.
an
individual
violated
the
treaty
if
they
took
a
migratory
bird
out
of
season.
and
so
in
that
sense,
the
enforcement
statute
did
nothing
more
than
put
a
criminal
penalty
on
violating
conduct
that
was
already
prohibited
to
the
individual.
and
in
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
characterization
of
our
argument,
but
only
to
add
that
this
would
be
the
anti-clear
statement
case.
because
the
one
place
that
this
convention
talks
about
imposing
obligations
on
individuals,
it's
a
promise
by
the
nation
state
to
pass
penal
legislation
that
is
in
accordance
with
their
constitutional
systems.
so
it's
very
bizarre
--
that's
article
vii,
section
1,
it's
i
think
33a.
so
it's
very
bizarre
when
the
only
way
we're
reaching
individual
conduct
here,
unlike
the
treaty
in
holland,
is
a
united
states
promise
to
pass
legislation
that
comports
with
our
constitutional
process,
to
say
that
the
convention,
therefore,
allow
us
to
pass
legislation
that
doesn't
comport
with
our
constitutional
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
sarin
gas
is
i
think
more
equivalent
to
something
that
the
congress
would
try
to
deal
with
like
the
way
it
dealt
with
marijuana
in
raich.
i
think
--
it's
just
a
reflection
of
the
idea
that
when
you're
talking
about
things
where
the
federal
government
is
trying
to
prohibit
it,
then
there's
a
greater
federal
power
to
do
that.
and
i
think
with
sarin
gas
you
could
imagine
--
put
aside
the
commerce
power
for
a
second,
put
aside
the
treaty
power
--
it
may
be
that
with
sarin
gas,
even
under
the
war
powers,
the
federal
congress
can
say,
look,
that's
something
that's
--
you
know,
it's
sort
of
inherently
a
chemical
weapon
and
we're
going
to
prohibit
people
from
having
that.
that's
very
different
from
these
situations
where,
if
you
think
about
it,
the
only
thing
that
makes
these
chemicals
chemical
weapons
instead
of
chemicals
is
their
internal,
intrastate
use
in
a
malicious
way.
and
that's
different,
i
think,
from
at
least
a
hypothetical
statute
that
says,
look,
here
are
--
i
mean,
there's
three
schedules
in
the
statute,
43
different
chemicals
that
are
particularly
problematic.
if
the
federal
government
wants
to
regulate
those
and
prohibit
the
unauthorized
possession
of
those,
i
don't
see
why
they
couldn't
do
that
with
or
without
the
treaty.
but
when
--
what
is
so
anomalous
here
is
the
idea
that
these
chemicals,
everything,
rat
poison,
vinegar,
whatever
it
is,
these
things
are
perfectly
lawful,
we
don't
think
of
them
as
chemical
weapons,
unless
and
until
they're
used
in
a
malicious
way,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
become
classified
as
chemical
weapons.
that's
a
very
odd
statute.
but
it
does
i
think
operate
in
a
way
that
is
just
inconsistent
with
the
bedrock
principle
that
the
federal
congress
just
doesn't
have
this
kind
of
police
power.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
believe
so.
it's
certainly
not
one
that
is
listed
on
the
three
schedules.
there
are
43
chemicals.
neither
of
these
are
on
there.
and
i
do
think
there
is
an
important
difference
because
--
this
is
perhaps
an
odd
way
to
think
about
it,
but,
you
know,
this
is
a
statute
that's
really
trying
to
regulate
nouns,
chemical
weapons.
and
with
respect
to
something
like
weaponized
chemicals
or
sarin
gas,
it
makes
sense
to
say
those
are
chemical
weapons.
but
with
respect
to
otherwise
harmless
chemicals,
the
only
thing
that
under
the
government's
theory
turns
them
from
chemical
weapons
--
i'm
sorry
--
from
chemicals
into
chemical
weapons
isn't
a
noun,
it's
a
verb.
it's
their
malicious
use.
and
that
puts
you
in
a
very
odd
sort
of
situation.
i
think
that,
you
know,
if
congress
had
come
in
and
said,
look,
there
are
certain
chemicals
that
by
their
very
nature
are
almost
inherently
weaponized,
i
think
congress
would
have
a
lot
more
authority
to
proceed
in
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
couple
points--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
sotomayor,
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
generally,
you
might
be
right
that
--
that
the
criminal
law
takes
objects
that
are
otherwise
innocent
and
say
they
can
be
used
in
a
malicious
way
and
criminalizes
it.
but
most
of
that
work
is
done
by
state
and
local
criminal
law,
and
at
the
federal
level
you
need
something
else.
you
need
a
jurisdictional
element,
something
that
has
a
distinct
federal
concern.
second,
as
to
the
concerns
about
this
convention--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
treaty
power--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--especially
when
there's
this
much
of
a
disconnect
between
what
the
treaty
power
does
and
what
the
statute
does,
which
is
the
treaty,
again,
does
not
directly
regulate
at
all
individual
conduct.
it
is
regulated
at
nation
state
conduct.
now,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
that
nation
states
poison
romantic
rivals,
attempt
to
commit
suicide
or
try
to
get
rodents
out
of
their
houses.
and
so
when
individuals
do
those
things,
i
think
it's
--
it's
hard
to
draw
an
analogy
between
what's
forbidden
to
a
nation
state
and
the
individual
action.
but
any
work
that
is
done
in
the
statute
by
drawing
that
analogy
is
done
by
the
statute
and
not
by
the
convention.
so
i
don't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
and
we
would
say
that
under
our
narrowing
construction,
that
that's
covered.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
it's
a
war-like
use
of
the
chemicals.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
would
also
point
out
for
the
record
that
that
same
conduct
would
obviously
be
covered
directly
by
federal
statutes
that
target
terrorism
directly.
so
no
matter
how
you
decide
that
case,
whether
you
accept
our
narrowing
--
if
you
accept
our
narrowing
construction,
that
conduct
will
be
covered
by
two
federal
statutes.
if
you
don't
accept
our
narrowing
construction
but
hold
this
statute
unconstitutional,
then
that
conduct
is
still
going
to
be
covered.
and
i
just
think
when
you
try
again
to
think
about
what
the
convention
is
after,
it
is
not
really
after
ms.
bond's
conduct.
i
don't
think
any
one
of
our
treaty
partners
said,
oh,
my
goodness.
there's
been
a
deployment
of
chemical
weapons
in
norristown,
pennsylvania;
i
sure
hope
the
united
states
steps
up
to
its
treaty
obligations
and
prosecutes
this
horrible
deployment
of
chemical
weapons.
nobody
would
say
that
because
nobody
speaking
normal
english
would
identify
this
as
a
deployment
of
chemical
weapons
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
two
things,
justice
kagan,
neither
of
which
will
surprise
you,
i
suppose.
one
is
i
don't
think
this
is
consistent
with
our
constitutional
processes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kagan,
i
think
you
have
to
read
missouri
v.
holland
both
in
the
context
of
the
treaty
that
the
court
had
before
it
and
the
argument
that
it
had
before
it.
missouri
made
a
very
strange
argument
in
missouri
v.
holland,
one
that
no
modern
litigant
would
make.
they
made
an
argument
that
--
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
identify
a
conflict
between
the
federal
treaty
and
state
law
and
said,
therefore,
we
win
under
the
supremacy
clause.
and
holmes
scratched
his
head
and
said
no.
the
treaty
under
--
under
article
6
is
supreme
to
both
state
law
and
not
the
other
way
around.
but
he
also
said
this
one
sentence
that
sort
of
bedeviled
the
lower
courts
here,
which
says,
well,
and
if
the
treaty's
valid,
of
course,
the
legislation
is
valid.
that
made
sense
in
the
context
of
the
treaty
he
had
before
him,
because
he
had
a
treaty
that
directly
prohibited
individual
conduct
and
a
statute
that
enforced
that
individualized
prohibition
with
criminal
penalties.
so
in
that
case,
i
suppose
it
was
right,
that
the
treaty
and
the
implementing
legislation
stood
or
fell
together.
that's
not
the
case
here.
if
i
could
reserve
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
the
senate's
role
in
the
ratification
of
treaties
cannot
be
a
sufficient
political
check,
and
one
reason
is
that
sometimes
the
precise
role
they
play
as
a
check
is
to
make
a
treaty
non-self-executing.
and
so,
to
take
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
example
of
an
international
treaty
that
purported
to
regulate
marriage
rights,
one
thing
that
the
senate
very
well
might
do
in
that
case
is
to
say,
well,
we
will
ratify
it,
but
we're
going
to
make
sure
it's
non-self-executing
and
maybe
we
will
use
our
spending
power
or
something
to
get
the
states
on
board,
but
we
are
not
just
going
to
impose
a
national
solution.
so
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
a
non-self-executing
treaty
necessarily,
even
if
it's
valid,
guarantees
the
validity
of
the
enacting
legislation,
because
some
of
the
reason
that
you
make
a
treaty
non-self-executing
is
to
preserve
federalism.
a
second
point
is
to
respond
to
the
argument,
which
i
think
i've
already
explained
why
it's
not
correct,
but
it
is
the
suggestion
that
there
is
no
daylight
between
the
convention
and
the
statute.
there
is
huge
daylight,
and
the
daylight
is
precisely
whether
it
affects
individual
conduct
and
how
it
affects
individual
conduct.
with
all
respect,
everything
on
justice
breyer's
list
a
is
not
stuff
that
i
think
implicates
the
convention
at
all.
but
yet
under
the
government's
unwavering
theory
that
you
can't
make
any
limitations
on
the
statute,
that's
all
covered
by
the
statute.
there's
your
daylight.
now,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
our
statutory
construction
argument
is
one
way
out
of
this.
i
think
that
you
have
to
understand
the
way
that
“
peaceful
”
is
used
in
the
statute
is
essentially
a
term
of
art.
i
would
analogize
it
to
a
situation
where
two
scientists
in
antarctica
get
in
a
fistfight.
okay,
that's
not
conduct
we
condone,
but
i
don't
think
we've
violated
our
pledge
to
reserve
antarctica
for
only
peaceful
purposes.
and
that's
the
same
way
we
would
like
you
to
interpret
this
statute.
now,
the
government
says
you
can't
do
that
because
that's
going
to
mess
up
what's
going
on
in
syria.
with
all
due
respect,
i
assume
that
the
issue
in
syria
is
whether
or
not
the
nation
state
of
syria
is
doing
something
that
would
violate
the
convention
if,
contrary
to
fact,
they
were
signatory
to
this
convention.
so
if
you
want
to
make
clear
that
you're
only
talking
about
individual
conduct,
i
think
you
can
solve
that
whole
problem
right
there.
but
if
i'm
wrong
and
the
only
way,
as
the
government
assures
you
that
you
can
make
this
legislation
work
is
to
have
it
be
in
exercise
the
police
power,
well,
then
the
answer
is
that
the
legislation
is
simply
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
say
it's
not,
but
i
think
it
has
to
do
more
with
the
particular
qualities
of
sarin
gas,
the
fact
that
it's
on
schedule
a,
the
fact
that
nobody
can
possess
that
for
any
lawful
use.
and
what
makes
something
like
vinegar
or
even
potassium
dichromate
different
is
what
puts
it
over
the
ledge
from
being
an
ordinary
chemical
to
a
chemical
weapon
is
precisely
its
use
and
its
use
alone.
now,
justice
kagan,
you
asked
a
great
question:
what
was
congress
thinking
when
they
did
this?
i
think,
with
respect,
the
congress
wasn't
focused
on
this
issue
at
all.
if
you
look
at
the
legislation
they
passed
to
implement
this,
the
chemical
industry
and
others
put
in
front
of
them
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
problem
with
the
inspections
of
chemical
production
facilities
that
were
authorized
under
the
convention.
when
congress
had
the
constitutional
problem
in
front
of
it,
they
had
all
sorts
of
provisions
to
deal
with
that
constitutional
concern.
now,
the
future
ms.
bonds
of
the
world
didn't
have
quite
the
same
lobbying
resources
as
the
chemical
industry,
so
they
didn't
avert
to
this
problem.
and
that's
precisely
why
some
kind
of
clear
statement
rule
or
the
like
would
make
perfect
sense
in
this
to
make
sure
congress
doesn't
exercise
the
police
power
when
all
it
thinks
it's
doing
is
implementing
a
treaty.
the
last
thing
is
just
to
say
about
the
state
department
legal
advisor's--
