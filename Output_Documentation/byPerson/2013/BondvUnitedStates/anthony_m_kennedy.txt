justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
had
been
the
president's
counsel,
would
you
have
advised
him
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
sign
this
treaty
as
written?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
--
is
it
one
way
to
characterize
your
argument
or
is
it
too
unfairly
confining
to
your
argument
to
say
that
what
you're
suggesting
is
something
like
a
clear
statement
rule,
that
if
the
treaty
intends
nation
states
to
have
their
own
constitutional
structure
superseded
at
a
minimum
it
has
to
say
so,
and
then
we
will
come
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
can
do
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
also
seems
unimaginable
that
you
would
bring
this
prosecution.
but
let's
leave
that.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
did
not
give
the
line
to
the
chief
justice's
question
where
there
was
a
treaty
that
intruded
on
the
federal
structure.
you
can
have
a
treaty
where
the
president
is
required
to
set
aside
any
state
law
that
in
his
view
contravenes
a
national
interest.
that's
a
structure
problem.
you've
--
you've
given
us
no
--
no
principle
the
other
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
precept,
then,
that
a
treaty
cannot
be
inconsistent
with
our
constitutional
structure?
