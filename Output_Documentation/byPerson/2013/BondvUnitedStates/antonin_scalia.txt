well,
we
didn't
take
this
case
to
--
to
decide
the
commerce
clause
question,
did
we?
the
government
didn't
even
assert
it
below.
it
asserts
it
now,
but
as
we
took
the
case,
the
issue
was
whether
the
treaty
supported
the
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
i
--
i
don't
understand
how
--
how
you
distinguish
sarin
gas.
why
is
sarin
gas
different
from
vinegar?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
if
--
if
that
unimaginable
thing
should
happen,
it
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
explore
that,
your
proposition
that
there's
no
daylight
between
the
treaty
itself
and
the
implementing
legislation.
it
seems
to
me
there
--
there's
a
lot
of
daylight
between
the
two.
let's
take
--
and
i
pick
this
example
not
because
it's
controversial,
but
because
it
relates
to
an
area
where
the
federal
government
has
never
been
thought
to
have
authority,
namely
family
law.
there
are
no,
you
know
federal
marriage,
federal
divorce,
federal
adoption.
it's
all
been
state
law.
let's
assume
that
an
international
treaty
is
approved
by
two-thirds
of
the
senate
and
the
president
which
requires
states
to
--
to
approve
same
sex
marriage.
all
right?
now,
if
--
if
that
were
a
self-executing
treaty,
same
sex
marriage
would
have
to
be
approved
by
every
state.
if
it
is
not
self-executing,
however,
it
will
be
up
to
congress
to
produce
that
result,
and
congress
would
do
it
or
could
do
it
at
least
by
having
a
federal
marriage
law.
and
then
you
would
have
to
have
a
federal
divorce
law
and,
i
suppose,
a
federal
adoption
law.
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference
between
just
doing
it
through
a
self-executing
treaty
and
dragging
the
congress
into
--
into
areas
where
it
has
never
been
before.
i
think
there
is
daylight
between
the
treaty
and
requiring
the
treaty
to
be
implemented
in
the
fashion
that
you
assert
is
necessary
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
the
case.
i
think
there
--
there's
a
great
difference
between
requiring
the
states
by
a
self-executing
treaty
to
permit
same
sex
marriage
and
dragging
the
federal
government
or
allowing
the
federal
government
to
enter
into
this
whole
field
of
marriage,
divorce,
adoption,
family
law,
where
the
federal
government
has
never
been.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
horses
eat
potatoes?
i
didn't
know
horses
ate
potatoes.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
those
quotes
pertain
to
self-executing
treaties.
yes,
there
is
no
limitation
on
what
--
what
the
president
and
the
senate
can
impose
as
a
self-executing
requirement,
namely
that
the
states
must
give
back
to
british
citizens
property
that
they
confiscated
or
whatever
else.
but
it's
a
different
question
whether
a
treaty
can
expand
the
power
of
the
federal
congress
into
areas
that
it
has
never
been
before.
that's
a
separate
question.
and
neither
hamilton
nor
any
of
the
other
quotes
that
you
refer
to
address
that
question.
