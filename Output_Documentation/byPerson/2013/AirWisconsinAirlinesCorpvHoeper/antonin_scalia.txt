justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
it
--
you
said
it
is
conceded
that
--
that
those
things
should
have
been
brought
to
the
airline's
attention.
has
that
been
conceded?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
--
i
think
they
said
if
it
--
if
they
were
brought,
they
should
have
been
brought
in
a
different
fashion,
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
they
--
they
have
conceded
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
convey
anything
justifiably,
sure,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
defamatory
require
that
it
be
materially
false?
can't
i
defame
somebody
with
a
statement
in
--
in
which
the
derogatory
information
is
not
material
to
anything
at
all,
but
it's
just
derogatory?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
to
be
materially
false
to
sustain
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
still
support
a
defamation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
is
material
to
the
person's
reputation.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
could
say
he's
nuts,
but
the
question
isn't
whether
could
say
it.
the
question
is
whether
that
is
false.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
--
that
a
lot
of
people
will
--
will
exaggerate
and
say
things
that
are
simply
not
true
doesn't
make
it
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is
that
somebody
ought
to
determine
whether
the
exaggeration
or
whatever
it
was
was
material,
whether
--
whether
it
would
have
made
any
difference
to
tsa
if
it
had
been
described
otherwise.
and
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
as
--
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
nobody
has
made
that
determination;
right?
the
colorado
supreme
court
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
--
whether
it
would
have
affected
tsa
or
not,
putting
it
--
putting
it
the
proper
way,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
what
we're
confronted
with,
simply
the
--
the
need
for
somebody
to
make
that
factual
determination,
right?
and
you're
saying
what?
there's
no
need
to
make
it
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
two
--
there
are
two
different
issues
of
falsity
that
we're
talking
about
here,
of
materiality.
one
is
the
defamation
issue,
and
it
is
material
to
say
that
somebody
is
mentally
unstable
when
all
that
he
did
was
lose
his
temper.
okay?
that's
my
view
of
it.
that
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
calling
him
mentally
unstable,
instead
of
he
lost
his
temper
or
just
saying
he
lost
his
temper,
would
have
produced
the
same
effect
with
the
airlines,
whether
the
airlines,
even
if
he
had
said,
well,
he
lost
his
temper,
he's
been
fired
from
his
job,
he
may
have
a
--
he
may
have
a
gun,
whether
that
alone,
without
saying
he
was
mentally
unstable,
would
have
induced
the
airline
to
take
him
off
the
flight.
there
are
two
different
questions.
materiality
for
defamation
is
--
is
quite
different
from
the
materiality
for
purposes
of
obtaining
the
immunity
under
this
act.
the
latter
question
is
for
the
court,
but
the
former
is
for
the
jury,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
give
the
jury
two
different
instructions?
you
are
to
find
materiality
for
purposes
of
whether
it's
defamatory
or
not
and
then,
having
found
that
it
is
defamatory,
you
must
make
a
second
materiality
finding,
namely,
would
this
defamatory
statement
have
caused
tsa
--
if
it
had
been
accurate,
would
tsa
not
have
taken
the
action
that
it
did,
not
have
removed
this
man
from
the
flight?
you're
going
to
give
the
jury
those
two
instructions
on
materiality?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
--
you'd
feel
snug
and
comfortable
in
making
reports
to
airlines,
knowing
that
whether
you're
going
to
be
held
liable
is
going
to
be
up
to
some
jury
who
is
going
to
see
that
this
person,
his
career
was
ruined,
and
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
jury
to
say
whether
he
can
recover
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
give
me
a
lot
of
comfort.
if
you're
really
concerned
about
enabling
people
to
come
forward
without
fear
when
they
have
a
suspicion
of
something
i'm
saying,
well,
you
know,
some
jury
will
decide
whether
you
put
it
wrongly
or
not
and
if
you're
putting
it
wrongly
would
have
made
a
difference,
it
doesn't
make
me
happy.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
you
reading?
