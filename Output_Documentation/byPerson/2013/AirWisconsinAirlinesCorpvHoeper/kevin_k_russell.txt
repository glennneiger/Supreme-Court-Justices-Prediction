mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
sets
of
questions
before
the
court
here.
there's
a
legal
question
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
atsa
and
maybe
some
subsidiary
questions
about
the
division
of
authority
between
judge
and
jury
and
what
the
materiality
standard
is;
and
then
there's
a
question
about
what
to
do
with
this
case.
and
those
two
sets
of
things
should
be
considered
differently
because
much
of
what's
being
argued
here
today
was
not
presented
to
the
lower
courts.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
let
me
unpack
that.
i
think
there
is
three
parts
to
that
question.
the
first
is,
implicit
in
that
is
atsa
immunity
factual
questions
for
the
court
or
for
the
jury?
and
we
agree
with
the
government
that
you
should
apply
the
ordinary
qualified
immunity
standards
and
historical
disputes
about
the
facts
are
handled
by
the
jury.
of
course,
if
the
court
can
say,
look,
even
on
the
plaintiff's
view
of
the
facts
immunity
is
proper,
you
can
enter
summary
judgment.
the
second
question
is
what
is
the
materiality
standard.
justice
scalia,
you've
suggested
that
the
standard
is
would
tsa
have
done
the
same
thing
any
way?
and
i
take
the
government
even
to
be
saying
that
that's
not
the
right
test,
because
we
can't
know
because
tsa
won't
tell
us.
tsa
has
to
keep
secret
its
procedures
about
what
it
would
do
and
when;
and
as
a
consequence,
i
think
the
proper
standard
is
the
standard
that
applies
under
new
york
times
and
in
other
defamation
cases,
which
is
the
masson
standard:
would
a
true
statement
have
a
different
effect
on
the
security
officials'
mind?
and
we
think
you
can
have
a
gloss
on
that.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i'm
saying
the
same
standard
of
material
truth
applies.
actual
malice,
the
subjective
good
faith,
is
the
principal
protection
afforded
to
the
baggage
handlers.
even
if
what
he
says
is
blatantly
materially
false,
so
long
as
he
believe
it,
so
long
as
he
acted
in
good
faith,
he's
protected
here.
so
the
question
is,
what
happens
when
somebody
like
mr.
doyle,
who
has
been
found
to
have
acted
in
bad
faith,
and
that's
not
challenged
here
--
does
he
nonetheless
get
immunity
because
what
he
said
was
materially
true?
we
think
the
standard--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
legal
question
is
that
you
have
the
same
division
that
you
have
in
qualified
immunity,
that
material
disputes
of
facts
are
resolved
by
the
jury
and
then
the
court
reviews
those
--
those
findings
under
the
normal--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--if
--
if
you
think
that
there's
no
disputes
about
those
facts,
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
otherwise
on
those
facts,
and
you
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--all
right.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
--
i
think
the
materiality
question
goes
to
the
jury,
subject
to
review
by
the
court
on
the
motion
for
directed
verdict,
whatever.
but
there's
also
--
i
also
want
to
make
clear
that
i
disagree
with
the
premise
of
that
question
about
what
the
standard
of
materiality
is,
and
it's
not
whether
tsa
would
have
acted
differently.
it's
whether
tsa
would
have
had
a
different
impression
about
facts
that
are
undoubtedly
material
to
their
determination
not
only
about
the
extent
of
the
threat,
but
also
what
to
do
in
the
immediate
aftermath.
they
have
to
make
a
decision
from
the
get-go,
not
only
whether
to
investigate
or
not,
but
whether
or
not
to
respond
by
sending
an
officer
down
or
scrambling
a
swat
team.
and
certainly
being
told
that
somebody
is
mentally
unstable
and
may
be
armed
is
going
to
be
materially
--
be
a
materially
different
impression
on
their
minds
about
those
questions.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
you
apply
the
masson
test,
which
is
would
a
truer
statement
have
a
different
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
reader?
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
to
have
done
something
differently.
it's
just
that
they
understand
the
facts
differently
than
they
do
based
on
what
was
said.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
materially
false,
yes,
if
the
difference
would
have
made
a
difference--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
you
would,
but
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is,
would
the
statement
have
a
different
effect
on
the
readers
or
the
listeners.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
listeners,
the
tsa.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
so.
and
in
addition,
whatever
you
say
about
this,
you
should
also
keep
in
mind
what
was
actually
argued
below.
let
me
say
a
few
things
about
how
this
went
down.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
it
has
to
make
a
difference
in
the
way
that
they
would
evaluate
the
existence,
nature,
or
extent
of
the
threat.
and
so
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
to
the
way
that
they
evaluated
the
nature
or
the
extent
of
the
threat
then
it's
not
material.
but
keep
in
mind,
the
way
that
this
case
was
litigated
below,
they
themselves
proposed
the
masson
standard.
and
it's
--
we've
reproduced
their
brief
to
the
colorado
supreme
court.
it's
on
page
30a.
they
say:
"a
statement
is
not
considered
false
unless--
"
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--page
30a
of
the
red
brief.
it
is
where
we
reproduced
their
colorado
supreme
court
brief.
and
on
page
30a,
they
say:
"a
statement
is
not
considered
false
unless
it
would
have
a
different
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
than
what
the
pleaded
truth
would
have
produced.
"
and
they
cite
masson.
"this
new-found
atsa-specific
materiality
test
comes
largely
from
the
united
states'
invitation
to
brief
at
the
cert
stage
in
this
case.
"
and
they
never
asked
for
an
instruction
on
materiality
at
all,
much
less
an
atsa-specific
materiality
instruction
to
the
jury.
they
never
argued
for
an
atsa-specific
materiality
test
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
that
was
their
principal
argument
below
and
that's
clearly
wrong.
and
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
that
that's
not
the
right
way
to
--
to
go
about
dealing
with
this.
this
is
a
statute
that
is
premised
on
--
that
is
based
on
the
model
of
qualified
immunity.
in
the
federal
courts,
qualified
immunity
factual
issues
are
submitted
to
the
jury
and
subject
to
ordinary
appellate
review,
sometimes
heightened
appellate
review
with--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--so
the
materiality
consider
compares
what
was
said
--
and
you're
right,
there's
no
dispute
about
that
--
and
what
was
true,
and
there's
a
lot
of
dispute
about
that.
but
we
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
even
if
you
say
that
it's
a
question
of
law
for
the
court,
even
if
you
take
it
upon
yourselves
to
decide
it,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
way
in
which
they
can
say
that
these
statements
were
materially
true.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
i
think
you'd
lose
in
both.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
in
both--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
let
me
be
clear
about
that
then.
if
they
give
all
the
--
all
the
facts
--
and
i'm
not
sure
what
all
the
this
is
true,
this
is
true,
this
is
true
--
they
simply
explained
all
the
facts
and
then
appended
to
it
their
evaluation
that
he
was
crazy,
i
don't
think
they
would
be
immune.
i
think
they
lose
immunity
for
that.
but
that's
not
what
happened.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
airline
would
be
immune,
correct.
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
think
there's
a
difference
between
that.
what's
the
difference
is
when
the
person
asserts
that
somebody
is
mentally
unstable
as
a
fact
and
doesn't
give
the
background
facts
to
allow
somebody
to
make
an
alternative--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
let
me
--
sure.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
let
me
ask
--
answer
the
second
question
first,
which
is
we
had
an
expert
witness
who
was
formerly
in
charge
of
writing
security
regulations
for
tsa
and
the
faa
before
that
who
testified
that
in
light
of
the
truth,
a
call
wasn't
even
warranted,
but
that
he
perfectly
understood
why
tsa
acted
the
way
it
did
given
the
contents
of
the
call.
now,
this
wasn't
a
focus
because
nobody
made
the
argument
that
this
could
be
a
materially
false--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
definitely
think
that
it
would
be
appropriated
for
this
court
to
write
an
opinion
that
says,
look,
to
the
extent
footnote
6
suggests
that
some
true
statements
aren't
protected
by
atsa,
that's
wrong.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
think
you
can
say,
look,
we
don't
know
what
it
means,
but
to
the
extent
it
means
that
atsa
doesn't
affect
all
true
statements,
that's
wrong.
but
in
this
case,
the
jury
found,
and
three
courts
--
colorado
courts
affirmed,
that
the
statements
weren't
true.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
there
was
an
instruction
to
the
jury,
and
in
instruction
no.
9
at
page
579
of
the
joint
appendix,
awac
told
the
jury
that
to
enter
a
verdict,
they
had
to
find
that
the
statement
was
false.
so
the
jury
found
that
that
was
false.
on
appellate
review,
two
courts
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
that,
even
though
they
didn't
ask
for
a
materiality
instruction.
those
two
courts
resolved
every
material
falsity
claim
or
every
materiality
objection
that
awac
actually
raised
in
the
context
in
which
it
actually
raised
it,
which
was
whether
we
had
satisfied
our
version
--
burden
to
prove
the
elements
of
common
law
defamation.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
that
there's
a
huge
difference.
there's
no
reason
to
say
that
he
may
be
armed.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
suppose
i
were
to
know
that
there
is
a
lawyer
in
town
who
has
a
concealed
carry
permit,
and
i
know
he
has
a
hearing
at
the
courtroom
--
at
the
courthouse
down
the
road
later
today.
if
i
were
to
call
the
security
folks
there
and
say,
hey,
just
to
let
you
know,
there's
a
--
there's
a
lawyer
coming
to
the
argument
and
he
may
be
armed,
everybody
would
understand
that
i
was
saying
to
them
that
there
was
something
more
than
the
theoretical
possibility
that
he's
armed
and
that
i
have
some
information
to
believe
that
he
is
violating
or
intending
to
violate
the
law
that
prohibits
him
from
bringing
that
gun
to
the
court.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
true
statement
would
be--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
it
would
have
been
true
for
them
to
say,
look,
we're
calling
to
let
you
know
because
mr.
hoeper's
an
ffdo,
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
gun
with
him,
but
we
can't
tell
for
sure,
so
we
just
thought
we
would
tell
you
in
case
you
have
any
questions
and
want
to
investigate
further.
by
not
saying
--
by
not
qualifying
“
may
be
armed
”
with
the
statement
that
"we
have
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
he
actually
has
a
gun.
"
which
is
the
truth,
i
think
they
gave
a
very
different
impression
--
and
mr.
laware,
for
example,
the
vice
president
who
made
the
decision
to
make
the
call,
testified
that
if
he
had
been
told,
as
a
pilot,
that
a
mentally
unstable
person
who
may
have
a
gun
was
boarding
his
plane,
it
would
make
him
very
concerned
about
the
safety
of
his
crew
and
passengers.
this
is
at
ja
72
to
272.
and
as
a
consequence,
he
said
those
aren't
the
words
i
would
have
anticipated
being
used,
because
he
recognized
as
somebody
in
the
industry
what
effect
those
words
would
have
on
a
reasonable
security
person.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
again,
i
don't
think
it's
that
subtle.
i
think
an
ordinary
person
would
--
would
think
i
was
being
misrepresenting
in
the
example
that
i
gave,
which
i
think
is
the
same.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--we
acknowledge
that
that
is
not
an
important
part
of
our
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mentally
unstable.
and
that's
--
you
know,
this
court
has
used
the
phrase
“
mentally
unstable
”
as
a
shorthand
for
describing
people
who
are
subject
to
involuntary
commitment,
and
people
who
are
barred
by
federal
law
from
owning
a
gun.
these
are
trigger
words
in
--
in
this
context.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
because
i
would
understand
that
they're
not
saying
that
he
might
fall
over.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
it
doesn't.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
be
facetious
about
it.
but
the
point
is
that
whether
they
said
“
unstable
”
or
“
mentally
unstable
”,
everybody
understood
it
was
the
same
thing,
and
it
had
the
same
implication,
which
is
very
serious.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
they
said
that,
but
they
also
said
he
is
unstable.
they
said
unstable
pilot.
and
when
you
couple
those
together,
even
if
they
just
said
they
were
concerned,
i
think
that
would
be
false
and
misleading,
in
part,
because
they
weren't.
i
mean,
we
had
testimony.
we
asked
them,
"did
you
think
that
mr.
hoeper
was
mentally
unstable?
"
and
mr.
orozco
said,
"i
don't
believe
he
was
mentally
unstable.
"
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
you
could
take
that
into
account.
but
you
also
have
to
recognize
that,
hopefully,
this
wouldn't
be
the
same
because
most
people
don't
get
treated
as
unfairly
as
mr.
hoeper
was.
and
i
think
there
is
abundant
evidence
for
the
jury
to
conclude
that
he
was
acting
with,
maybe
not
the
best
way,
but
he
was
acting
within
the
--
the
spectrum
of
normal
human
reaction
to
being
treated
that
unfairly
with
respect
to
something
that
important.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
even
for
pilots.
for
example,
mr.
sherman,
who
is
a
pilot,
who's
trained
in
spotting
threats,
testified
--
he's
the
one
who
got
yelled
at
--
testified
that
when
he
left
the
training
center
he
didn't
think
that
mr.
hoeper
was
acting
irrationally,
he
didn't
think
that
he
was
a
threat.
he
was
shocked
to
learn
that
calls
to
tsa
had
actually
been
made.
and
mr.
orozco
talked
to
him
briefly
before
he
boarded
the
flight,
and
he
knew
at
that
point
that
he
was
an
ffdo,
he
was
a
pilot,
he
knew
about
the
last
chance
letter,
he
knew
about
the
prior
incidents
of
pilots
taking
down
airplanes.
and
he
told
him:
go
ahead,
and
get
on
the
flight.
there
really
isn't
--
these
are
the
people
who
would
know
what
is
surprising
and
concerning
about
the
conduct
of
our
client
in
this
case,
and
none
of
them
were
willing
to
say
that
he
was
in
fact
mentally
unstable,
and
that's
telling.
even
if
they
are
willing
to
say
now,
through
their
lawyers,
that
they
had
concerns
about
his
mental
stability,
the
fact
that
they
weren't
willing
to
say
that
he
was
mentally
unstable
shows
that
they
recognized
that
there's
a
material
difference
between
those
two
statements.
otherwise
they
would
have
said:
yes,
he
was
mentally
unstable
because
we
had
concerns
about
his
mental
stability
and
that's
the
same
thing.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
understand.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there
is
enormous
leeway
already
and
that
is
in
the
actual
malice
standard.
so
long
as
the
person
believes
that
what
he
is
saying
true,
so
long
as
he
doesn't
suspect
that
it's
untrue.
he
has
immunity,
even
if
it's
grossly
untrue.
and
that's
the
--
that's
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
why,
and
you
have
that
protection
under
the
first
amendment
to
start
with.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we're
able
to
identify
only
six
cases,
and
this
is
one
of
them,
in
the
entire
ten-year
history
of
the
statute
when
anybody's
even
cited
this
provision
in
an
opinion,
published
or
unpublished,
state
or
federal.
and
that's
because
the
protection
that's
afforded
by
the
actual
malice
standard
which
comes
in
the
first
amendment,
but
also
in
this
statute,
provides
ample
protection
for
people
who
are
acting
in
good
faith.
and
i
don't
think
that
you
need
to
come
up
with
some
special
materiality
lite
standard
under
this
statute,
particularly
when
there's
no
reason
to--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
think
that's
--
that's
an
application
of
the
masson
standard,
which
is
if
you
know
who
the
reader
is.
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
ask
the
jury
to
think
about
who
the
reader
is,
but
it's
a
world
of
difference
to
say--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
you
have
the
same
problem
with
figuring
out
what
he's
going
to
do.
in
fact,
it's
much
harder.
so
i
think
whatever
--
if
you
adopt
that
standard,
you
have
the
same
problem
with
my
standard.
and
i
think
my
standard's
easier
to
deal
with.
i
think
you
can
look
at
--
you
can
have
expert
testimony,
as
we
did.
you
can
look
at
--
you
can
ask
the
people
who
are
in
the
industry
and
involved
in
the
case,
as
we
did.
and
they
all
seem
to
recognize
that
saying
somebody
is
mentally
unstable
versus
saying
we
have
concerns
about
his
mental
state
or
that
he
is
angry
would
have
a
hugely
different
effect
on
a
listener's
mind
in
that
industry.
that's
why
mr.
laware
said
he
would
be
very
concerned
if
those
words
were
used
and
said--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
the
difference
is
--
i
mean,
what
mr.
laware
was
saying
is
it
calls--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i'm
more--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i'm
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
figure
out
what
they
would
have
done.
in
part
this
is
just
general
defamation
law,
right?
you
are
entitled
to
presume
damages
so
long
as
what
is
said
affects
your
belief
about
this
person.
and
there's
nothing
in
this
statute,
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
that
alters
that
ordinary
standard.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
certainly
what
they
do
with
the
information
is
reflective
of
the
effect
it
has
on
their
minds.
so
we
do
think
that
in
any
case
you
could
show
that
tsa
would
have
acted
differently.
you
would
necessarily
be
showing
that
it
had
a
different
effect
on
their
mind.
but
the
problem
is
tsa
is
not
going
to
tell
us
what
they
would
have
done
if
a
different
statement
had
been
made.
this
is
not
a
standard
that
can
actually
be
applied
in
the
real
world.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's
not
necessary
because
there
is
substantial
protection
already
provided
to
good
faith
speakers
who
will
know
that
so
long
as
they
are
believing
what
they
say,
they
can
say
whatever
comes
to
their
mind
without
having
to
consult
with
their
lawyer.
in
any
event,
even
if
this
court
thought
that
was
the
standard,
even
if
you
thought,
and
we're
willing
to
forgive
them
for
not
raising
that
standard
in
the
colorado
courts,
we
do
think
that
on
this
evidence
there
was
a
basis
for
concluding
that
tsa
would
have
acted
differently
had
they
known
the
truth.
and
that's
because,
as
i
said
before,
we
had
expert
testimony
from
somebody
who
is
very
qualified
in
this
area
who
said
that
had
he
known
the
truth
as
a
tsa
official
he
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
receive
a
call.
and
that
--
he
perfectly
understood
the
very
dramatic
response
given
the
content
of
what
was
actually
said.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
so
one
possibility
is
--
it
depends
very
much
on
when
the
call
was
made.
part
of
the
difficulty
here
was
raised
was
that
mr.
darr
waited
for
two
and
a
half
hours
after
receiving
this
information
before
making
the
call.
had
the
call
been
made
earlier,
there
was
testimony
there
was
lots
of
things
they
could
have
done.
they
could
have
called
and
checked
to
see
if
he
had
checked
in
his
gun
at
security.
they
could
have
found
him.
they
could
have
called
him
on
his
cell
phone.
but
even
having
waited
as
long
as
they
did,
they
could
have
asked
somebody
on
the
airplane
to
just
go
and
ask
him
and
talk
to
him
and
see
if
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
something
amiss
that
would
require
going
back
to
the
gate.
now,
i
acknowledge
that,
again
because
the
call
was
so
late,
there
really
wasn't
a
ton
that
could
be
done,
but
that's
not
a
reason
to
give
them
greater
leeway.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
tsa
has
told
people,
report
what
you
know
immediately.
and
so
we
do
think
that
mr.
doyle's
conduct,
in
which
he
wasn't
consulting
with
supervisors
--
he
did
nothing
during
that
two-and-a-half
hours
that
would
reflect
that
he
had
an
actual
concern
about
mental
stability
or
danger
here.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
he
did
testify
to
that
fact,
yes.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
doyle
did.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
think
he
gave
any
details
about
the
content
of
that
discussion.
but
certainly
you
can
understand
why
tsa
would
not
want
something
like
this
to
happen
again
because,
you
know,
when
somebody
is
given
false
information
that
--
particularly
when
it
leads
to
an
elevated
response
that
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
under
a
proper
report,
that
gives
rise
to
security
concerns
and
dangers
in
itself.
when
you
send
armed
men
onto
a
plane
full
of
nervous
people
in
close
quarters
who
don't
know
what's
going
on
and
officers
who
believe
that
there
may
be
a
man
on
the
gun
--
with
a
gun
who's
mentally
unstable
on
the
plane,
that
is
a
recipe
for
danger
and
for
accidental
things
to
happen
and
for
people
to
get
hurt,
in
addition
to
diverting
attention
from
things
that
might
be
actually
more
serious
incidents
that
are
going
on
at
the
same
time.
congress
didn't
think
that
the
way
to
promote
airline
security
here
is
simply
to
give
carte
blanche
immunity
to
anybody
who
reports
anything
about
suspicious
activity,
if
they
thought
they
could
have
ended
at
subsection
a.
instead,
they
recognized
that
there's
a
balance
and
that
people
who
make
bad
faith
reports
that
are
materially
untrue
ought
not
to
be
immune,
recognizing
that
there
might
be
some
deterrent
effect
at
the
margins,
but
acknowledging
the
need
to
strike
this
balance.
and
in
this
case,
whatever
you
end
up
doing
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
come
back,
before
i
leave,
to
this
point,
that
this
case
has
been
litigated
up
the
chain
without
any
request
for
atsa-specific
materiality
instruction,
with
the
court
addressing
every
material
truth
objection
that
was
actually
made
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
made.
and
it's
important
to
point
out
that
they
never,
even
when
they
argued
material
truth,
argued
that
mentally
unstable
or
were
concerned
about
mental
instability
was
materially
true.
the
only
argument
they
ever
made
about
that,
and
you
can
read
it
at
the
appendix
to
the
red
brief,
was
that
this
was
a
protected
statement
of
opinion
because
it
could
not
be
true
or
false.
and
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
saying
that
something
isn't
true
or
false
and
saying
that
it
is
true.
because
to
determine
whether
it's
protected
opinion,
you
only
have
to
look
at
the
statement
to
determine
whether
it's
substantially
true.
you
have
to
look
at
the
evidence.
and
so
they
have
not
--
at
the
very
least,
they
have
not
preserved
any
argument
that
the
statement
“
mentally
unstable
”
was
materially
true.
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
think
that
you
can
satisfy
the
government's
need
for
clarity
about
what
the
legal
standard
is
by
simply
saying
atsa
protects
true
statements,
full
stop,
but,
nonetheless,
affirming
this
case,
the
opinion
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
colorado
court
asked
whether
these
statements
were
true
and
said
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
they
were
not
and
resolved
every
materiality
objection
that
they
actually
made
in
the
course
of
their
opinion.
the
fact
that
they
did
it
under
a
different
subheading,
that
they
asked
the
right
question
under
the
wrong
subheading,
isn't
a
ground
for
reversal
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
with
the
caveat
that
an
appellate
court
has
no
obligation
to
resolve
materiality
objections
unless
they're
actually
raised
by
the
defendant.
