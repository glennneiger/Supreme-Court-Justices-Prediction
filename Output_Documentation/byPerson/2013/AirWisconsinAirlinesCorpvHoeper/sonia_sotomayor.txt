justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what's
so
difficult
about
simply
saying
he's
angry?
why
choose
the
word
“
mentally
unstable
”?
isn't
it
with
an
intent
to
connote
something
more
than
the
facts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
yes,
but
from
facts.
so
isn't
there
a
difference
between
saying
someone's
angry
and
someone's
mentally
ill--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--has
a
mental
problem
or
is
mentally
unstable?
don't
you
think
that
the
intent
is
to
convey
something
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
disagree
with
justice
scalia?
he
drew
a
distinction
between
two
forms
of
materiality,
whether
something's
materially
false,
meaning
is
it
misleading.
that,
presumably,
would
go
to
a
jury.
but
whether
or
not
this
misleading
statement
would
be
material
to
the
tsa
or
to
security
officers
is
a
question
for
the
court.
you
disagree
with
that
position
by
him?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
actually
would
like
your
opinion,
the
sg's
opinion,
on
whether
this
is
an
issue
for
the
court
or
the
jury.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
fight
us.
what
--
what
is
your
view?
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
other
than
proving
at
trial
that
these
statements
were
misleadingly
false,
or
false,
how
did
you
prove
that
the
statements
would
have
had
an
effect
on
a
reasonable
security
officer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
--
what's
the
evidence
that
you
expect
parties
to
present
and
what
was
it
you
presented
to
show
that
their
response
would
have
been
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
tell
me
the
difference
between
having
a
huge
effect
on
that
listener's
mind
and
the
listener
taking
a
different
action?
i'm
not
sure
how
--
what
the
difference
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
more
upset--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
--
i'm
more
concerned,
but
i'm
going
to
take
the
identical
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
i
read
somewhere
that
after
this
incident
there
was
a
discussion
between
or
among
mr.
doyle
and
various
government
agencies
to
figure
out
how
to
avoid
something
like
this
in
the
future.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
testified?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
was
your
sense
--
i
don't
remember
the
testimony
now.
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
do
we
decide
what
a
reasonable
security
officer
would
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
does
--
how
--
how
do
we
as
judges?
i'm
not
sure
how
juries
would
do
it,
i'm
not
quite
sure
judges
would
do
it.
so
what
evidence
did
you
proffer?
he
says
he
had
an
expert.
what
did
you
have
at
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yeah,
but
we
don't
decide
whether
it
was
reasonable
force
if
we
think
there's
a
question
about
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
not
a
question
of
historical
--
if
there's
a
question
about
how
a
reasonable
officer
would
respond.
there's
competing
experts.
who
decides
that
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there
are
some
levels
of
--
of
force
that
we
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
don't
qualify
as
excessive.
and
we
have
said
that,
but
when
have
we
said
that
what
might
be
excessive
to
one
--
to
some
is
a
jury
question?
