mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
not
even
mr.
hoeper
can
defend
the
decision
below
and
for
good
reason.
under
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
and
consistent
with
this
court's
first
amendment
precedence,
truth
matters,
and
airlines
should
not
lose
their
atsa
immunity
unless
their
statements
are
materially
false.
none
of
that
is
in
dispute
anymore.
also
not
in
dispute,
i
think,
is
that
air
wisconsin
was
justified
in
picking
up
the
phone,
calling
tsa
and
conveying
certain
core
facts;
namely,
that
mr.
hoeper
was
mad
at
the
airline;
that
he
was
a
federal
flight
deck
officer
or
ffdo;
that
he
had
walked
out
on
his
training,
his
last
chance
to
keep
his
job,
and
he
was
about
to
board
a
plane.
i
don't
believe
any
of
those
facts
are
in
dispute.
what
is
in
dispute
is
how
those
facts
were
framed
or
phrased
to
tsa
in
that
call.
how
the
report
was
packaged
and
did--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--i
think
they--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--i
believe
they
have
conceded,
justice
scalia,
that
those
facts
could
have
been
conveyed,
justifiably.
if
we
had
conveyed
those
core
facts
using
different
words,
there
would
not
be
any
issue.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
and
the
question,
justice
scalia,
is
whether
we
framed
or
phrased
the
report
in
an
adequate
manner.
and
in
assessing
that
issue,
the
question
comes
down
to
how
much
breathing
space
airlines
should
be
given
in
making
these
reports.
how
much
room
there
should
be
for
permissible
characterization
and
expression
in
making
these
reports.
and
context
should
be
kept
in
mind
in
answering
that
question,
three
things
in
particular.
first,
these
reports
are
being
made
by
airline
employees
such
as
pilots
and
flight
attendants
and
baggage
handlers
and
ticket
agents
who
are
being
told
by
tsa,
they
have
to
report
in
realtime
without
investigation,
without
calling
their
lawyer,
without
stopping
to
think
on
how
to
refine
the
perfect
script.
and
they
are
being
told
to
do
this
based
upon
their
suspicions.
in
some
cases,
suspicions
of
other
people's
emotions
or
state
of
mind.
that's
one
critical
piece
of
context.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
that's
exactly
right,
justice--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--i
believe
the
respondents
have
also
acknowledged
that
a
call
could
have
been
made
conveying
certain
facts.
you're
completely
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
we'd
be
likely
immune
if
only
we
had
used
different
words
and
those
different
words
are
immaterial.
that
lower
court
engaged
in
hairsplitting--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--the
second
point
of
context
is
that
these
reports
are
being
made
to
tsa,
other
reasonable
air
safety
officials,
for
the
purpose
of
passenger
safety
and
aviation
security.
and
tsa
tells
the
airlines,
if
you
have
any
doubt,
report.
if
you
see
something,
say
something.
and
if
you
don't
say
something--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--and
the
third
piece
of
context
is
the
consequences
of
a
failure
to
make
a
report
can
be
catastrophic
for
passenger
safety
and
aviation
security.
and
that's
why
tsa
says,
if
you
don't
report
sincerely-held
concerns,
you
might
be
sanctioned
by
us
for
failing
to
make
the
report,
placing
airlines
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
no,
the
issue
is
not
about
the
jury
instructions,
justice
kennedy.
the
question's
about
the
statutory
immunity
and
the
aviation
transportation
security
act,
atsa,
and
whether
that
immunity
requires
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
statement
was
materially
false.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
by
the
court
in
our
view.
we
think
under
any
standard,
we
should
prevail.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
i
believe
two
things.
one,
i
believe
they
concede
the
legal
question
that
material
falsity
is
part
of
the
atsa
analysis,
and
that's
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
cert.
on
the
second
question,
which
is
not
before
the
court,
is
who
should
decide
this
issue,
the
court
or
the
jury?
i
believe
they
feel
the
jury
should
answer
that
question.
again,
that
issue
is
not
strictly
before
the
court,
but
i
think
on
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court,
they
agree
that
material
falsity
is
part
of
the
atsa
analysis.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
well,
the
jury
--
and
this
is
a
question
of
the
jury
instructions,
which
are
not
being
challenged,
are
not
before
the
court.
but
the
jury
was
not
given
instruction
on
materiality.
the
jury,
also,
was
not
given
instruction
on
clear
and
convincing.
they're
not
given
instruction
that
the
decision
should
be
about
what
the
effect
would
be
on
tsa.
so
the
jury
didn't
answer
that
question.
the
jury
shouldn't
have
answered
that
question.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
under
the
common
law,
justice
scalia,
the
statement
has
to
be
materially
false.
we
agree
with
that.
and
we
also
think
that--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--to
sustain
a
defamation
judgment.
of
course,
it
depends
upon
state
law,
but
generally
under
the
common
law
the
statement
has
to
be
materially
false.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
in--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
a
very
important
distinction,
because
in
the
common
law
context
you're
concerned
about
the
effect
on
the
person's
reputation,
his
general
reputation
in
the
community,
whereas
in
the
atsa
context
you're
talking
about
a
very
particular
listener.
the
listener
is
tsa
or
a
reasonable
air
safety
official,
and
the
purpose
of
the
report--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
statement
might
be
deemed
defamatory
if
you
don't
have
the
atsa
immunity,
but
because
of
the
atsa
immunity
it's
not
materially
false.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
that
would
not
be
immune
because
that
would
not
be
relevant
to
a
suspicious
transaction,
suspicious
activity,
or
passenger
safety,
so--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--correct.
it
would--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--correct.
and
it
would
not
be
immune.
but
the
report
we
had
here
is
not
that
someone's
having
an
affair,
but,
rather,
the
report
we
made
is
that
someone
might
possibly
be
giving
rise
to
a
concern.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
with
those
words,
i
think
i
would,
justice
alito,
because--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--the
same
argument,
yes.
now,
i
think
there
are
words
that
would
cross
the
line.
i
don't
believe
those
words
do
because
--
a
couple
things.
first,
the
gist
of
the
statement
is
still
the
same.
the
gist
is
this
is
a
person
who
might
possibly
have
a
gun
and
might
possibly
be
in
a
state
of
mind.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
that's
a
fair
characterization.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
justice
alito,
i'm
keeping
in
mind
the
first
important
piece
of
context,
which
is
these
reports
are
being
made
by
tens
of
thousands
of
aviation
employees
on
the
ground
that
could
have
different
educations
and
socioeconomic
backgrounds
and
might
not
all
speak
the
way
we
do,
especially
in
an
uncertain
context
in
which
the
facts
are
rapidly
evolving.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
a
couple
things,
justice
sotomayor.
first,
it's
not
--
the
question
is
whether
the
gist
of
the
statement
is
the
same.
it's
up
to
tsa
to
draw
the
connotations,
the
implications--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--i
think--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
different
people
express
the
same
thought
in
different
ways.
i
think
a
baggage
handler
in
boston
or
a
flight
attendant
in
laguardia
might
use
different
words,
such
as
“
he
lost
it
”,
"he
went
off
the
deep
end.
"
“
he
was
acting
irrationally
”,
“
he
blew
up
”.
and
the
lower
court
said--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--justice
scalia,
a
couple
things
in
response.
first,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
there's
a
simple
statement
and
the
person
hangs
up.
there's
a
conversation
with
tsa,
in
this
case
a
10-minute
conversation,
in
which
they
probe
behind
the
facts
and
they
found
out
what
happened,
that
mr.
hoeper
was
angry
and
upset
and
he
blew
up
that
morning
at
training.
and
second,
the
lower
court
recognized
this
and
said
if
we
simply
had
used
“
irrational
and
blew
up
”,
we'd
be
immune,
as
opposed
to
saying
“
mentally
ill
”.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
correct,
justice
scalia,
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
oh,
no,
no.
justice
scalia,
we
say
that
there
is
a
need
to
make
that
determination.
the
lower
court
said
no
need,
material
falsity
is
not
part
of
the
atsa
analysis.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
they
had
to
say
it.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
justice
breyer,
the
lower
court
recognized
that
the
atsa
immunity
question
is
for
the
court
to
decide.
and
because
they
left
that
issue,
material
falsity,
to
the
jury,
they
said
it's
not
part
of
the
atsa
immunity
analysis,
and
that's
error.
it
should--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
jury
did
make
that
determination,
but--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--correct.
what
the
jury
did,
first
of
all
--
first
of
all,
it
shouldn't
have
gone
to
the
jury
because
it's
part
of
the
atsa
immunity
analysis,
which
is
for
the
court
to
decide.
but
second,
the
jury
did
not
ask
whether
or
not
our
statement
would
have
a
different
effect
on
tsa,
which
is
the
proper
test
here.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
i
agree
completely,
justice
scalia.
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
unless
this
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--my
answer,
justice
breyer,
to
your
question
is
that
the
jury
answered
a
different
question.
they
answered
a
question
about
whether
it's
material
under
defamation
law,
not
whether
it's
material
to
tsa
as
required
by
atsa
and
that
determination
not
go
to
the
jury.
that's
for
the
court
to
decide.
and
the
lower
court
said:
i'm
not
going
to
--
we're
not
going
to
address
that
question,
we're
not
going
to
address
it
because
it's
not
part
of
atsa,
and
that
was
legal
error,
as
even
mr.
hoeper
concedes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
very
quick
points:
first,
the
mixed
question,
the
application
of
law
to
facts
most
certainly
should
be
decided
by
the
court,
not
the
jury
just
like
this
court
held
in
muehler
versus
mena
or
nellis
and
congus.
the
historical
facts
are
a
separate
question,
but
the
ultimate
question
of
materiality
is
one
that
should
be
decided--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--how
do
we
decide
it?
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
we
had
experts,
too.
and
judges
should
resolve
it
just
like
they
resolve
issues
of
reasonable
force
and
probable
cause.
they
have
to
use
judgment
and
common
sense
in
light
of
the
broad
leeway
that
tsa
should
be
given
in
answering
these
question.
but
the
important
thing
is
resolving
that
issue
at
the
earliest
possible
stage.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
if
there's
a
question
of
historical
fact,
if
there--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--well,
the--
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
--according
--
nellis
said
the
ultimate
question
is
for
a
court
to
decide.
but
our
point
is,
first
of
all,
the
lower
court
here
said
the
question
is
for
a
court
to
decide
for
atsa
immunity.
but
under
any
standard,
we
should
still
prevail
because
the
matter
of
law,
the
statement
here
simply
is
immaterial.
falsity
--
the
alleged
falsity
is
immaterial.
under
any
standard,
the
court
should
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
the
standard
here
is
immaterial.
and
the
second
point
i
was
going
to
address
is
the
court
should
address
that
application
question
in
this
case
because
airlines
need
guidance.
they
need
clarity.
they
need
predictability
on
what
the
law
is.
and
right
now,
there's
no
predictability
because
the
lower
court
held
that
hairsplitting
distinctions
make
a
difference.
that
the
difference
between
fire
today
and
fire
tomorrow
is
a
material
difference.
and
the
court
should
make
clear
those
hairsplitting
distinctions
do
not
make
a
difference.
mr.
jonathan
f.
cohn
i
would
say
it
matters
on
whether
that
different
thing
is
material.
so,
for
instance,
if
it's
sending
one
officer
versus
two
officers
to
the
plane,
that's
not
material.
that
does
not
make
a
difference.
this
is
a
case
this
court
should
decide.
there's
no
material
distinction
between
mental
stability
and
mental
state
or
rationality
or
blow
up.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
