chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-315,
air
wisconsin
airlines
v.
hoeper.
mr.
cohn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
material
to
--
to
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
you
can
have
a
defamatory
statement
about
a
pilot
that's
not
material
to,
you
know,
air
safety.
is
that
what
materiality
goes
to,
the
particular
reason
that
the
statement
is
made?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
you
can't
defame
--
someone
gets
immunity
for
a
statement
that
would
be
defamatory
in
the
common
law
context
if
made
generally,
but
because
it's
made
in
the
context
of
information
about
flight
safety
that's
somehow
immune?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
call
some
tsa
official
and
say
this
pilot,
you
know,
is
having
an
affair.
that's
immune?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
feigin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
you
don't
--
there's
no
reason,
and
presumably
a
good
trial
judge
wouldn't
instruct
the
jury
on
those
two
separate
questions
using
the
same
word,
right?
i
mean,
you
could
articulate
what
you
mean
by
“
material
”
in
--
in
each
context.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
say
it
would
be
material
to
tsa.
it
would
say
just,
as
my
colleague
has
suggested,
whether
or
not
tsa
would
have
done
anything
different
if
a
different
formulation
had
been
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
if
it
made
a
difference
in
their
mind
whether
to
send
one
officer
to
his
house
or
a
swat
team
somewhere
else
that's
material
and
you
lose
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
difference
--
if
the
difference
in
the
language
causes
tsa
to
do
anything
differently,
then
you
lose
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
different
effect
--
a
different
effect
on
who?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
tsa.
so,
but
that's
what
i'm
saying.
let's
say
the
tsa
person
looks
at
it
and
says,
ah,
this
is
--
you
know,
if
it
had
been
phrased
as
you
say,
ah,
this
is
silly,
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything.
but
he
says,
well,
it
looks
silly
to
me,
but
i'm
going
to
send
it
to
my
supervisor.
that's
a
different
effect
on
the
listeners'
mind
and
you
say
that
difference
causes
the
airline
to
lose
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
there
be
two
--
you
would
view
these
two
scenarios
differently?
the
same
historic
facts.
somebody
calls
and
said
this
happened,
this
happened,
this
happened.
he
was
acting
crazy.
and
the
next
one,
this
happened,
this
happened,
this
happened
and
he's
crazy.
do
you
think
you
lose
immunity
in
the
latter
case,
but
not
the
former
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
lose
in
both.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
a
layperson
--
a
layperson
who,
you
know,
just
looks
at
this
and
said
he's
acting
crazy,
they're
not
immune
from
that.
if
they
called
tsa
and
say
that,
everything
is
true,
i
guess
you
would
say
up
until
that
characterization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
would
be
--
the
airline
would
be
immune.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know.
but
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
the
person's
subjective,
uneducated
evaluation,
“
he
was
acting
crazy
”,
and
a
difference
between
that
person
saying
“
he's
crazy
”.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
not
suggesting
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
they
just
said
he's
unstable
as
opposed
to
he's
mentally
unstable,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what
you
were
saying.
[laughter]
when
justice
kennedy
posed
the
question
that
he
was
unstable,
you
said
“
mentally
unstable
”.
and
my
point
is
that
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
your
case,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
affects
your
belief
is
different
in
a
context
like
this.
it
may
not
affect
your
belief,
but
you
may
decide,
but
given
what's
at
stake,
i
don't
think
he's
mentally
unstable
just
because
somebody
calls
and
says
that,
but
i'm
going
to
send
it
up
to
my
supervisor,
make
sure
he
feels
the
same
way.
and
you
tell
me
that
you
lose
immunity
if
he
says,
i
don't
think
he's
mentally
unstable
and
throws
it
away,
as
opposed
to
when
he
says,
i
don't
think
he's
mentally
unstable
but
let's
see
what
the
boss
thinks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cohn,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
