justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
did
it
say
“
material
”?
i
thought
--
i
thought
--
i
think
so
far
as
i've
read
this,
the
argument
is
about
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
statement.
and
you're
saying
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
should
have
said
it
has
to
be
false.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
i've
looked
at
--
i've
looked
at
footnote
17
or
footnote
6
or
whatever
it
is
on
page
17,
and
i
think
that
their
characterization
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
right.
that
is,
the
colorado
supreme
court
is
going
to
be
very
surprised
if
we
tell
them
that
they
never
said
it
has
to
be
false.
what
they
said
here
is:
"in
the
determination
of
immunity,
we
need
not
and
therefore
do
not
decide
whether
the
statements
were
true
or
false.
"
correct?
why
not?
because,
they
say,
"the
trial
court
properly
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury.
"
"accordingly,
the
jury
was
entitled
to
determine
the
elements
of
the
defamation
claim,
including
whether
the
statements
were
false.
"
so
as
i
read
that,
which
i
think
you'll
hear
from
the
other
side
in
about
a
few
minutes,
the
--
the
colorado
supreme
court
says:
look,
the
jury
found
that
the
statement
was
false,
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
we're
worried
about
whether
the
false
statement
was
made
with
reckless
disregard
of
its
truth
or
falsity
or
knowledge
that
it
was
false.
okay?
that's
how
i
read
the
footnote.
and
they
say
something
like
that
on
page
30
and
31
of
their
brief.
so
--
so
if
i'm
right
about
that,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
are
we
supposed
to
say
that
matters
of
truth
or
falsity
are
not
for
the
jury?
are
we
supposed
to
say
that
the
jury
went
beyond
what
any
reasonable
person
would
go,
would
do
here?
what
is
it
we're
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do.
i'd
like
an
answer
--
well,
you
can
do
it
in
your
rebuttal,
but
i'd
like
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
accept
that
for
the
moment,
accept
all
that.
what's
bothering
me,
a
picky
little
point.
but
the
picky
point
is
that
your
statement
of
the
question:
whether
atsa
immunity
may
be
denied
without
a
determination
that
the
air
carrier's
disclosure
was
materially
false?
no,
can't
be.
but
i
read
the
footnote,
footnote
6,
last
sentence.
it
says
there
was
such
a
determination.
the
jury
made
it,
and
we
don't
have
to
go
back
over
it.
so
what
are
you
arguing?
are
you
arguing
that
there
should
be
like,
as
there
is
in
free
speech
cases,
you
know,
a
special
duty
upon
an
appellate
court
to
go
back
over
such
a
jury
finding?
are
you
saying
the
colorado
supreme
court
was
wrong
in
the
second
part
of
footnote
6
when
it
says
the
jury
made
it?
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
may
have
waived
it,
you
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
have
granted
cert
on
this
question.
so
--
so
given
that
fact,
could
we
do
this:
one,
yes,
it
has
to
be
false;
two,
the
colorado
supreme
court,
because
of
footnotes
5
as
well
as
6,
which
i
haven't
picked
up,
and
other
things
they've
said,
is
at
least
ambiguous
about
the
role
the
jury's
finding
played.
and
given
that
fact,
what
we'll
do
is
we'll
go
through
and
see
where
the
parties
agree
about
what
happened
in
--
in
the
world,
and
insofar
as
they
agree,
we'll
take
it,
you
see.
your
side
will
get
the
underlying
assumption
and
looking
at
it
as
it's
agreed
upon,
we
find
either
that
it
would
be
or
wouldn't
be
within
the
scope
of
the
immunity.
and
on
that
one
you
might
lose.
but
is
there
--
is
there
--
what
do
you
think
of
that
procedure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
--
footnote
6
has
to
be
read
with
footnote
5,
which
i
hadn't
picked
up.
and
once
i
put
those
two
footnotes
together,
i
have
no
idea
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
of
us
have
had
the
experience,
at
least
i
have,
if
i
get
very
angry
at
something,
one
of
my
children
will
say:
god,
he's
mentally
unstable.
see,
i
mean,
that's
--
people
use
that
word
in
different
contexts.
and
what's
worrying
me
is
that
some
real
threat
comes
along
and
the
lawyers
get
involved
and
the
people
are
going
to
report
it
to
the
tsa,
start
watching
their
words
and
they
don't
know
what
the
lawyers
mean
exactly.
and
you
understand
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
isn't
the
best
thing
to
say
is,
look,
there
is
leeway
here,
considerable
leeway
on
the
part
of
the
airline
or
anyone
else
who's
reporting,
that
are
reporting
things
to
tsa.
all
it
means
is
they
are
going
to
search
him
more
thoroughly.
