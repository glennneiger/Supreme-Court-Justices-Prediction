justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
--
can
we
go
back
to
your
response
to
justice
scalia?
you
said
that
the
respondents
conceded.
but
--
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
it
was
the
colorado
supreme
court
that
said
that
the
airline
likely
would
have
been
immune
if
they
had
phrased
the
report
more
cautiously?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
--
it's
the
colorado
supreme
court,
not
the
respondent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
the
jury
--
did
the
jury
find
falsity?
do
you
recognize
that?
did
this
jury
find
that
the
statement
was,
as
you
say,
materially
false?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
did
--
how
did
they
make
it?
because
the
only
thing
i
see
is
the
special
verdict
sheet
and
it
doesn't
ask
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
the
“
who
decides
”
question.
i
find
it
very
confusing.
now
everybody
seems
to
say,
well,
it's
the
jury
that
decided
--
that
decides,
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
that
it
recognized
that
the
court
was
to
decide
this
question,
not
the
jury.
and
in
this
case
the
jury
decided
it.
that
was
error,
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
but
it
was
harmless.
so
who
decides?
is
it
--
is
it
the
court
or
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
factual
issues?
you
said
the
factual
issues.
i
didn't
think
that
there
was
much
dispute
about
what
was
said
to
the
air
traffic
safety.
so
what
are
--
what
are
the
disputed
facts
that
the
jury
would
find
relevant
to
the
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
didn't
--
they
said
we
were
concerned
about
his
mental
stability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
add
to
the
question
--
the
question
in
this
case
was
put
by
the
court
--
the
question
whether
atsa
immunity
may
be
denied
without
a
determination
the
air
carrier's
disclosure
was
material
and
false?
