justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
feigin,
they
have
that
wide
scope
because
of
the
actual
malice
standard,
that
somebody
needs
to
show
that
there
was
actual
knowledge
of
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
as
to
falsity.
and
you're
saying
that
we
should
do
something
different.
you're
saying
that
we
should
expand
what
falsity
means
in
this
context
as
a
sort
of
extra
protection,
and
i
guess
why
is
that
true?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
what
you
just
said,
because
even
the
way
you
just
phrased
that,
you're
asking
what
tsa
would
have
done.
how
else
can
we
think
about
materiality
other
than
by
asking,
well,
if
you
were
a
tsa
officer
and
you
heard
this
what
would
you
have
done?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
russell,
weren't
you
yourself
suggesting
the
twist
on
the
materiality
standard?
you
said
it
shouldn't
be
--
in
the
usual
case,
we
said
would
it
have
had
a
different
effect
on
the
mind
of
essentially
the
average
reader,
the
reasonable
reader.
and
you
say:
no,
here
we're
not
supposed
to
think
of
the
reasonable
person
generally;
we're
supposed
to
think
about
the
reasonable
tsa
officer.
haven't
you
conceded
that
yourself?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
do
we
know
about
the
reasonable
tsa
officer?
i
mean,
you
made
the
point
that
we
don't
know
a
lot
about
tsa
officers
in
terms
of
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
respect
to
any
given
set
of
facts,
and,
you
know,
i
find
it
a
little
bit
hard
to
think
about
the
question,
what
does
a
reasonable
tsa
officer
think,
without
thinking
about
the
question,
what's
a
reasonable
tsa
officer
going
to
do.
justice
elena
kagan
so
what
are
the
other
things
tsa
could
have
done?
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
this
call
was
made
and
it
was
a
much
more
--
in
tone,
it
was
much
more
factual
and
without
using
any
of
these
words,
but
it
said
the
guy
really
lost
his
temper
and,
you
know,
he
has
this
license
and
we
have
no
idea
whether
he,
in
fact,
is
carrying
a
gun,
but
he
could
be?
what
could
the
tsa
officers
have
done?
what
do
you
think
they
should
have
done
short
of
what
they
did?
say
that
they
were
concerned,
they
thought
this
might
be
a
problem?
what
are
the
midlevel
possibilities
of
a
response?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
cohn,
what
if
i
think
that
a
tsa
might
have
reacted
differently
to
what
was
actually
said
and
to
what
really
should
have
been
said?
would
they
have
reacted
either
way,
they
should
have
done
something
either
way,
but
they
would
have
done
a
different
kind
of
thing?
what
if
i
think
that?
what
does
that
suggest
about
the
proper
resolution
of
this
case?
