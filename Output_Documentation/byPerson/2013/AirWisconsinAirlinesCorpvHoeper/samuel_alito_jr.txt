justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
cohn,
on
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
on
the
report
that
was
made
here,
suppose
that
the
report
said
that
the
respondent
--
we
believe
the
respondent
is
mentally
ill,
or
we
believe
the
respondent
has
serious
mental
problems.
would
you
--
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
that's
what
was
said?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
would?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
facts
as
i
understand
it
were
that
he
became
very
angry
during
a
test,
during
a
flight
simulation
test.
he
took
off
his
headset,
pushed
back
his
chair,
threw
the
headset,
started
cursing
at
the
instructor,
and
then
later,
he
was
--
he
was
showing
anger
and
cursing
for
a
period
of
time
in
other
parts
of
the
facility.
does
it
go
beyond
that?
is
that
fair?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
and
you
think
based
on
that,
you
could
say,
we
believe
this
man
is
mentally
ill?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and,
mr.
feigin--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--my
understanding
of
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
is
this:
on
the
issue
of
atsa
immunity,
it
said
very
clearly
that
is
for
the
court.
and
it
says
in
footnote
5
it
gives
no
weight
to
the
jury's
findings
of
fact
with
respect
to
the
facts
that
it
found
on
the
immunity
question.
and
then
at
the
end
of
footnote
6
what
it
said
was,
having
found
that
there
is
no
immunity,
then
it
was
proper
for
the
trial
judge
to
submit
the
defamation
issue
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
made
findings
on
the
defamation
issue.
is
that
--
is
that
your
understanding
as
well?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
are
they
right
that
in
determining
atsa
immunity
the
jury
has
no
role,
doesn't
make
findings
of
historical
fact,
who
said
what,
anything
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
you
get
to
that,
before
you
get
to
that,
to
finish
up
on
the
point
you
were
making
earlier,
suppose
that
the
report
is
he
ranted
for
10
minutes,
and
then
suppose
the
jury
found
he
ranted
for
7
minutes.
now,
maybe
those
3
minutes
would
make
a
difference,
make
a
difference
in
the
impression
on
the
tsa.
that
would
be
enough
in
your
view?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
on
two
of
the
--
on
two
of
the
three
statements,
the
difference
between
the
literal
--
the
very
strict
truth
and
what
was
said
is
very
slight.
you
dispute
that.
they'd
said
he's
an
ffo
officer
and
he
may
be
armed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
literally
true.
it's
literally
true.
he's
an
ffo
officer.
he
has
a
gun.
he
may
be
armed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
be
a
true
statement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
with
respect
to
the
lawyer;
with
respect
to
your
client.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
talking
about
a
very
subtle
implication
of
the
statement.
and
i
agree
with
you,
there's
an
implication
there
that
may
not
be
justified,
but
you're
talking
about
something
very
subtle
in
--
in
the
context
of
--
of
someone
making
a
call
to
report
a
possible
threat.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
we're
talking
here
about
a
pilot?
i
mean,
my
impression
of
pilots
is
that
they
are
supposed
to
remain
perfectly
calm
even
when
terrible
things
happen.
well,
all
the
--
you
know,
all
engines
are
on
fire
and
one
of
the
wings
has
fallen
off,
but,
you
know,
you
don't
start
ranting
and
screaming.
and
so
someone
described
him
as
acting
in
a
manner
that
was
more
unprofessional
than
they
had
ever
seen.
do
you
think
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
maybe
for
ordinary
people,
but
how
about
for
pilots.
