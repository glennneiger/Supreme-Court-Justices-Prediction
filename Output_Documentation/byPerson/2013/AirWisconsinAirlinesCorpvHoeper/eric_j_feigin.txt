mr.
eric
j.
feigin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
essentially
undisputed
that
in
order
to
encourage
airlines
to
report
suspicious
activity
to
proper
authorities
the
atsa
immunizes
such
reports
when
they're
materially
true.
i
want
to
emphasize
two
main
points
about
the
scope
of
that
immunity.
first,
atsa
gives
airlines
very
wide
latitude
in
how
they
describe
the
suspicious
activities.
these
reports
are
made
against
an
inherently
uncertain
factual
backdrop,
and
that's
why
the
statute
protects
reports
of
any
suspicious
transaction
relevant
to
a
possible
violation
of
law
or
regulation
relating
to
air
safety.
misconceptions
and
exaggerations
can
occur
not
only
because
of
confusion
about
the
facts,
but
because
of
the
emotion,
the
stress,
and
potentially
even
the
fear
that
may
go
along
with
making
one
of
these
reports.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
masson
and
this
case.
masson
follows
the
more
general
defamation
law
rule
about
whether
a
statement
is
materially
false
in
terms
of
a
person's
reputation,
whereas
here
the
focus
is
on
what
a
reasonable
security
official
would
believe,
and
we
think
that's
fairly
seen
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
which,
again,
protects
statements
about
any
suspicious
transaction
relevant
to
possible
violation
of
law
or
regulation.
so
what
the
statements
are
intended
to
convey
is
a
suspicion
of
a
possible
threat
and
the
gist
in
this
context,
what
has
to
be
true
in
this
context,
is
the
suspicion
of
the
possible
threat.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
because
the
statute
talks
about
suspicions
and
possibilities,
that
the
actual
factual
basis
for
what's
reported
doesn't
need
to
be
particularly
strong.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
reason
real
difference
is
the
context.
i
think
in
masson,
you
were
talking
about
readers
of
a
general
interest
magazine,
the
new
yorker
magazine,
whereas
here,
the
audience
for
these
reports
is
much
more
specialized.
it's
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
receiving
reports
of
suspicious
activity.
now,
they're
not
interested
in
someone's
reputation
as
a
general
matter.
what
they're
interested
in
is
what
kind
of
threat
the
person
might
pose
and
what
might
happen
to
an
airplane
in
the
next
period
of
time
that
they
have
to
worry
about.
and
i
think
it's
particularly
important
that
the
court
give
wide
latitude
to
statements
in
this
context
because
there's
a
substantially
similar
provision
that
protects
individuals
who
make
reports
to
law
enforcement
authorities.
that's
in
6
u.s.c.
1104.
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
someone
responding
to
the
tsa's
ubiquitous
“
see
something,
say
something
”
campaign
were
to
inadvertently
or
recklessly,
as
later
concluded
by
a
jury,
have
some
sort
of
exaggeration
about
what
they
were
reporting
and
then
find
themselves
liable
for
civil
damages
just
for
trying
to--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
what
you're
supposed
to
do
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
the
jury
--
the
finding
that
the
jury
made
--
first
of
all,
the
jury
wasn't
actually
instructed
on
materiality.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
but
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
jury
found
the
statements
were
materially
false,
it
only
did
so
in
the
context
of
the
state
law
defamation
verdict.
and
as
justice
scalia
explained
and
as
i
tried
to
explain
earlier,
there's
a
difference
between
materiality
from
the
perspective
of
someone's
reputation
and
materiality
for
purposes
of
the
tsa
in
inquiry
that's--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
my
understanding
of
the
supreme
court
of
colorado's
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
is
encompassed
within
the
question
presented,
but
our
view,
as
we
explain
in
footnote
6
of
our
brief,
is
that
under
atsa,
questions
of
historical
facts,
such
as
what
was
actually
said
on
the
call
and
what
actually
happened,
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
materiality
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
we
believe
that
also,
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
with
very
careful
jury
instructions,
making
clear
the
very
wide
latitude
that
airlines
have
in
this
context.
and
because
airlines
have
such
wide
latitude
in
this
context,
we
think
very
often
the
courts
will
be
able
to
get
rid
of
these
kinds
of
cases
at
the
motion
to
dismiss--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--again,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
address
it
here.
we
actually
think
a
jury
would
resolve
the
materiality
question
under
the
atsa--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--we
do
think
the
court
should
give
the
jury
separate
instructions
on
atsa
and
then
if
it
passes
the
atsa
bar,
you'd
go
on
to
defamation
law.
but,
your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
fight
the
court
too
hard
if
it
wants
to
say
that
this
is
a
question
for
the
court.
what
i'd
really
like
to
emphasize
here
is
that--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
we
are
comfortable
with
the
court
saying
that
it's
a
question
for
the
court.
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
jury.
there'd
be
an
instruction,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
although
not
a
proper
instruction,
on
all
the
elements
of
atsa,
with
the
court
making
the
law
very
clear
to
the
jury
that
it
has
to
apply
for
atsa,
and
then
if
the
jury
gets
past
that,
they
would
get
a
separate
set
of
instructions.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
you
could
ask
how
tsa
would
have
understood
the
statement
with
their
particular
eye
towards
the
suspicion
of
a
possible
threat
that's
being
conveyed.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
we're
comfortable--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
i
think
what's
going
to
provide
the
adequate
good
feelings
that
airlines
have
making
these
reports,
to
make
them
feel
safe
making
these
reports,
is
for
this
court
to
emphasize
the
very
wide
scope
that
the
atsa
gives
to
how
airlines
characterize--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we're
doing
anything
different
from
the
actual
malice
standard
except
taking
account
of
the
context.
in
this
particular
context,
where
there's
a
lot
of
factual
uncertainty,
a
lot
of
emotion
mixed
in,
and
the
audience
aren't
readers
of,
for
example,
a
general
interest
magazine,
they
are
security
officials
looking
for
suspicion
of
a
possible
threat,
we
think
the
scope
of
the
materiality
test
is
very
broad.
thank
you.
