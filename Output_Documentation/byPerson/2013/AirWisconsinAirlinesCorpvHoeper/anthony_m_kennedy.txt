justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
had
--
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
there
were
three
critical
facts.
one
is
that
these
reports
have
to
be
made
on
suspicions
right
away
in
realtime
by
people
like
baggage
handlers.
and
your
second
point
was?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
the
third?
and
your
third?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
context,
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
the
issue
is
that's
before
us.
my
understanding
is,
is
that
there
was
no
finding
of
falsity.
now,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
had
to
be
defamatory.
lawyers
know
that
that
means
it
has
to
be
false,
i
assume.
and
are
you
saying
that,
you
know,
the
jurors
weren't
instructed
as
to
the
definition
of
“
defamatory
”?
is
that
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
position
--
although
they'll
tell
us
in
a
minute
--
does
respondent
take
on
that
issue
that
a
determination
by
the
jury
suffices?
as
you
understand
their
brief.
they
can
talk
for
themselves
in
a
few
minutes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
implicit
in
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
it
has
to
be
defamatory?
now,
if
you
say,
well,
even
if
it
is,
the
judge
--
the
court
has
a
duty
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
outset,
then
that's
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
the
statute,
44941,
was
intended
by
the
congress
to
incorporate
the
new
york
times-sullivan
standard,
the
masson
v.
new
yorker
standard?
and
--
and
if
so,
then
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
airline
is
under
a
duty
more
strict
than
the
one
that
you
have
just
explained
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
explained.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
statute
here
is
to
be
interpreted
differently
than
if
it
were
a
new
york
times
and
sullivan
case
or
masson-new
yorker
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
suppose
i'm
the
trial
judge
and
i
conclude
that
if
air
wisconsin
had
said
to
the
tsa,
along
the
lines
of
justice
scalia's
earlier
question,
we
have
an
employee
who
was
terminated
today.
he
probably
knew
it.
he
lost
his
temper
during
a
test.
he
might
think
that
some
of
our
employees
are
out
to
get
him
and
there
may
even
be
some
truth
to
that.
he's
authorized
to
carry
a
gun.
we
don't
know
if
he
has
one
or
not.
we're
giving
you
that
information.
suppose
i'm
the
trial
judge.
i
conclude
that
if
that
information
had
been
given
to
tsa,
tsa
quite
properly
stopped
this
plane
to
examine
the
pilot.
do
i
send
the
case
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
masson
reporter
for
the
new
yorker
magazine
spent
months
on
this
article.
they
had
proofreaders,
they
had
editors
in
new
york.
and
you're
saying
the
same
standard
applies
to
the
baggage
handler
who
has
only
10
minutes
to
decide
what
he's
going
to
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
my
question
i
first
asked
you,
i'm
the
trial
judge,
i
have
made
the
determination
that
tsa
would
have
acted
the
same
way.
i
still
have
to
submit
this
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
thought
that
even
if
the
facts
had
been
reported
much
more
accurately
than
they
were,
that
the
tsa
still
had
a
duty
to
investigate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can't
i
make
that
determination
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you're
right.
they
seem
to
rely
mostly
on
the
proposition
that
this
all
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
pursuing
justice
alito's
point
about
the
other
statement,
the
other
that
he
was
terminated
today.
well,
he
didn't
get
notice.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--okay.
and
then
the
final
thing,
i
guess,
was
the
same
thing
justice
scalia
had
in
mind,
was
that
he's
unstable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
want
us
to
say
the
call
has
to
be
made
right
away
without
reflection,
without
talking
to
supervisors,
without
some
quiet
discussion
first?
that's
what
you
want
us
to
put
in
the
opinion?
