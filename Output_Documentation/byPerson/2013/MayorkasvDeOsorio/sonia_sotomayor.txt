i'm
going
to
let
you
answer
his
question,
but
yes,
they
had
a
regulation
so
why
didn't
they
copy
the
regulation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
would
have
been
much,
much
simpler
to
say
this
is
limited
to
f2a
beneficiaries
than
to
write
it
the
way
they
did
and
say
this
is
to
everybody
who
ages
out.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
answer
him,
and
then--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
is
strange
because
i
look
at
(h)(3),
which
talks
about
automatic
conversion
of
battered
spouses,
of
widowed
spouses,
and
i
think
under
your
reading,
you're
basically
saying
congress
was
not
intending
to
let
those
people
jump
the
line.
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you
have
to
change
names?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
there's
automatic--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
why
did
congress
need
to
add
(h)
--
(h)(4),
using
exactly
the
same
language
that
it
used
for
(h)(3)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
they
--
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
same
benefits
of
automatic
conversion
as
(h)(3).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
can
have
automatic--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
can
have
automatic
conversion
only
in
the
situations
that
give
you
other
--
other
statutes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
for
f2a
children
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
these
steps,
are
they
applied
to
f2a?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
derivatives.
i'm
talking
about
the
children
of
spouses.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
everything
happens
at
visa
issuance
moment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
direct
or
derivative?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
he's
saying
--
but
what
he's
saying
is
that's
true
of
everybody.
fba,
any
of
these
categories
don't
get
converted
until
the
visa
is
actually
issued--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--until
you
go
to
the
consular
order
--
office
and
apply.
that's
true
no
matter
what.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
can
come
in
before
their
parent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
their
parent
has
to
become
a
citizen
and
then
they
can
come
in,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
so
confused.
you
better
unconfuse
me,
okay,
on
this
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
an
original
date
basically
to
the
original
petition,
meaning
there
has
--
it
is
that
that's
being
converted.
if
that
hasn't
been
granted,
there's
nothing
to
convert.
if
that
person
hasn't
become
a
citizen,
there
is
nothing
to
attach
any
change
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
talking
about
his
second
step.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
we're
talking
about
his
second
step.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
only
talking
about
his
second
argument.
