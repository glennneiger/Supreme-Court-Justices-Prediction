justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
reading
of
this
statute
gives
(h)(3)
a
very,
very
narrow
scope;
isn't
that
correct?
and
i
just
want
to
see
if
i
understand
exactly
how
narrow
it
is.
it
would
apply
--
first
of
all,
does
it
apply
to
any
employment-based
or
diversity-based
petitions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
it
applies
to
an
f2a
petition
filed
by
a
legal
permanent
resident
on
behalf
of
that
person's
spouse;
right?
and
--
and
if
that
--
if
they
have
a
minor
child,
then
the
minor
child
would
be
a
derivative.

justice
samuel
a.
alito,

suppose
there
are
two
--
suppose
there
are
two
lawful
permanent
residents
who
are
exactly
the
same
except
that
one
has
a
minor
child
and
one
has
an
adult
unmarried
child.
so
the
latter
files
an
f2b
petition
and
gets
in
line
on
a
particular
date,
right?
then
the
former,
the
lawful
permanent
resident
who
has
an
unmarried
--
who
has
a
minor
child,
files
an
f2a
petition
and
gets
in
that
line.
but
then
by
the
time
the
date
comes
up,
the
child
has
aged
out
and
so
now
you
would
say
that
would
be
converted
to
an
f2b
petition.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
person
would
be
--
the
child
would
be
at
a
much
lower
point,
right,
than
the
first
one?
why
would
congress
have
wanted
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
and
the
other
one
would
be
higher
up.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
oh,
okay.
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
your
real
quarrel
here
with
the
idea
of
an
appropriate
category
or
with
the
automatic
conversion?
on
the
respondent's
view,
why
isn't
there
an
automatic
conversion?
because
they
say
that
as
soon
as
the
person
ages
out
they
can
be
moved
into
--
into
another
category.
that
sounds
like
it's
automatic.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
it
automatic?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
automatic
just
means
something
occurs
without
anybody
having
to
initiate
the
change.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
isn't
there
--
why
isn't
it
automatic
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you're
saying
that
these
things
would
happen
--
do
i
understand
you
correctly,
these
things
or
most
of
these
same
things
would
happen
in
the
cases
in
which
the
government
says
there
is
automatic
conversion?
