justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
give
me
an
idea
of
how
--
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
alito.
can
you
--
i
don't
know
if
you
asked
the
irs
--
the
ins
this
question;
you
may;
something
like
it.
let's
look
at
all
of
the
derivative
beneficiaries
in
the
(f)s,
(f)(1),
(2)(a),
(2)(b),
(f)(3),
(f)(4).
and
for
the
most
part,
they're
grandchildren,
they
would
be,
or
children,
sometimes
nephews
and
nieces.
and
now
think
of
the
set
of
all
those
people
who
age
out.
okay?
they
started
out
as
children,
but
it's
15
years
later
--
they're
now
aged
out.
now
think
of
that
set.
it's
--
call
it
a
certain
size.
what
percent
of
that
set
do
you
think
are
accounted
for
by
the
f2a
people,
who
are
the
only
ones
on
your
interpretation
that
3
would
apply
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
idea,
any
rough
idea?
because
if
you
just
look
at
it,
one's
natural
instinct
is
just
what
justice
alito
said.
this
is
a
minuscule
component
of
a
set.
it's
much
bigger,
and
therefore,
it's
just
unlikely
that
congress
meant
(3)
to
apply
to
a
--
to
a
--
to
a
little
molecule
when
there's
the
whole
ocean.
now,
that
--
that's
the
kind
of
argument
you're
up
against,
i
think,
so
i
wanted
to
ask
you
that
empirical
question.
if
you
can
give
me
any
idea
of
the
empirical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
ask
--
anything
that
would
give
me
--
that's
the
total
global
picture.
that's
the
2,000,
3,000,
sometimes
10,000
aging
out.
all
right.
but
--
but
the
real
relevant
thing
is
if
we
can
get
some
idea,
which
seems
in
the
paper,
that
your
interpretation
applies
to
--
only
to
a
subset
of
those
people.
and
just
from
reading
it,
that
it's
qualitative
reading
it,
it
sounds
like
a
tiny
subset
of
those
people.
now,
we
can
argue
about
whether
that's
for
you
or
against
you.
i
think
it's
against
you,
but
nonetheless--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
f2a.
but
we
want
f2b
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
f2a.
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
it
looks
like
it's
between
10
percent
and
sometimes
it
gets
it
up
to
30
percent--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
don't
have
numbers
on
separation
from
parents.
we
do
know
that
these
people,
the
ones
that
would
be
caught
on
the
broad
interpretation,
have
also
been
waiting
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
years.
they've
all
been
waiting
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
years,
and
it
becomes
hard
to
choose
among
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
find
sympathetic
stories
all
over
the
place,
and
i
mean
--
all
right.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
with
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute?
i
looked
at
the
board's
opinion
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
in
the
two
paragraphs
just
prior
to
section
5,
at
the
end
of
section
4,
they
have
as
a
critical
step
in
their
--
in
reaching
their
conclusion,
their
belief
that
the
legislative
record
demonstrates
a
clear
concern
on
the
part
of
congress
to
ameliorate
the
delays
associating
with
the
process
of
the
visa
processing.
and
they
say
the
same
thing
in
the
paragraph
just
above
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
what
they
think
this
statute
is
about.
but
that
statute
--
that
problem
is
taken
care
of
in
(1)(b).
and
so
the
question
would
be,
if
that
problem,
which
subtracts
all
the
days
that
there
was
a
processing
delay,
is
taken
care
of
on
(1)(b),
they
can't
be
right
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
3.
so
unless
you
can
say
to
me
how
that
could
possibly
be
right,
that
reasoning,
then
what
we
should
do,
i
guess,
if
we
think
that
you
have
authority
in
the
government
to
interpret
this
minor
part
of
the
statute,
which
i
do,
is
generate.
send
it
back.
and
--
and
maybe
give
them
--
say
you
ought
to
do
this
again
because
the
reason
you
gave
is
not
good.
or
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
does
--
can
i
try
an
example
because
i
think
it's
easier
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
imagine
steven
is
a
citizen.
his
brother
charles
is
not.
so
under
4
--
and
charles
has
a
son
joseph
who
is
not.
that
will
help
you
think
about
it.
all
right.
so
we're
under
f4.
steven
files
a
petition,
the
beneficiary
is
charles.
charles
has
a
minor
son
joseph.
visa
is
granted,
et
cetera,
for
--
not
visa,
you
know,
he's
given
--
everything
is
in
order
and
now
charles
has
to
wait
about
ten
years
or
so.
by
the
time
he
gets
--
at
the
time
his
number
becomes
current,
the
number
becomes
available
for
the
alien,
namely
for
charles,
at
that
moment,
we
calculate
joseph's
age
and
it's
24.
so
your
idea
is
that
charles
is
current.
everything
is
fine.
he
goes
to
the
port
or
the
office,
wherever
he's
supposed
to
go,
and
he
brings
joseph
with
him.
at
that
point,
joseph,
since
he's
no
longer
a
child,
has
to
come
in
under
another
category,
and
that
category
is
going
to
be,
i
guess,
2b
because
charles
will
be
now
--
and
joseph
will
be
unmarried
over
21,
right?
am
i
right
so
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
an
imaginary
--
he
spells
it
with
a
v.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
i
have
it
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
but
there
is
one
thing
missing.
charles
has
not
filed
a
petition
for
joseph.
so
what
do
we
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
doesn't
--
doesn't
charles
as
a
lawful
permanent
resident
have
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
called
the
petition--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
which
joseph
is
named
primary
beneficiary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
f2b
petition,
because
charles
never
filed
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
yes;
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
you
don't
need--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
do
all
this,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
ask
you
a
quick
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
your
alternative
argument
with
you
and
justice
scalia.
i
take
it
your
argument
is:
look
at
the
words;
the
part
before
the
comma
defines
a
group
and
that
group
is
not
in
dispute.
it's
all
the
f
derivatives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
look
at
the
first
part.
it
says
the
petition
shall
automatically
be
converted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
if
i
lose
on
that,
then
look
at
the
second
part.
it
says,
the
alien
shall
retain
the
original
priority
date.
and
you
say
as
to
that,
that
has
an
independent
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
it's
either
a
or
b.
and
we
think
we
win
on
a
and
b,
but
if
not
we
at
least
win
on
b.
now,
has
the
agency
ever
expressed
a
view
in
respect
to
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
about
your
independent
b.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
wouldn't
the
right
thing
to
do
there
be,
in
respect
to
b,
send
it
back
to
the
agency
so
that
they
can
express
a
view
in
respect
to
that?
