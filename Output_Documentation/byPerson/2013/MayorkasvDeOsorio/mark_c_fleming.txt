mr.
mark
c.
fleming
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
began
at
step
2
of
chevron,
but
i
would
submit
that
this
case
can
and
should
be
resolved
at
step
1.
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
read
the
statute
in
a
highly
disfavored
way
such
that
it
is
not
harmonious
but
at
war
with
itself,
and
nothing
in
the
language
requires
that.
in
fact,
i
would
recommend
that
the
court
turn
to
the
back
page
of
the
government's
brief
where
the
statute
is
actually
set
forth.
and
we
can
see
that
provision
(h)(3)
consists
of
one
sentence,
and
that
sentence
consists
of
two
parts
separated
by
a
comma.
before
the
comma,
the
language
sets
forth
one
and
only
one
eligibility
criterion.
after
the
comma,
the
language
sets
forth
two
things
that
shall
be
done
if
the
eligibility
criterion
is
satisfied.
now,
importantly,
the
government
does
not
contend
that
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
language
before
the
comma.
everyone
agrees
that
it
contemplates
and
includes
all
derivative
beneficiaries.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
and
a
bedrock
rule
at
the
step
1
inquiry
is
that
the
court
reads
the
statute
as
a
harmonious
whole.
that
goes
double
when
we're
talking
about
a
single
sentence.
so
if
there
is
a
possible
reading
of
this
sentence
that
is
harmonious
with
the
clear
opening
clause
that
applies
to
all
derivative
beneficiaries
under
step
1
of
chevron,
that
is
the
reading
the
court
gives
to
the
statute.
it's
especially
important
here
because
the
precise
question
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
eligibility
and
scope.
who
gets
the
benefit
of
the
two
benefits
set
forth,
the
two
duties
set
forth
by
the
shalls
in
the
language
after
the
comma.
and
congress
spoke
to
that
directly
in
the
language
before
the
comma.
all
derivative
beneficiaries
who
have
gone
through
the
(h)(1)
formula
and
whose
age
is
determined
to
be
over
21.
now,
the
government's
claim
of
ambiguity
here
depends
on
asking
the
court
to
read
one
of
the
benefits
after
the
comma,
automatic
conversion,
in
such
a
narrow
and
limited
way,
a
way
not
required
by
the
plain
language,
a
way
that
even
the
bia
actually
did
not
adopt,
but
such
that
it
is
incompatible
with
the
broad
scope
set
forth
before
the
comma.
the
court
should
be
very
suspicious
of
that
reading,
because
it
is
exactly
the
contrary
of
the
traditional
tool
of
statutory
construction
going
back
to
brown
&
williamson
and
ftc
v.
mandel
that
says
the
court
reads
a
statute
holistically
as
a
harmonious
whole.
for
the
government's
argument
to
work,
the
court
would
have
to
be
satisfied
that
we
were
in
a
situation
like
national
association
of
home
builders
v.
defenders
of
wildlife,
which
is
the
only
case
that
they
cite
for
their
ambiguity
claim,
but
there
the
court
faced
two
different
statutes
and
acted
at
different
times
that
were
clearly
contradictory.
you
could
not
comply
with
both
of
them
at
the
same
time.
you
had
to
pick
one
or
other
the
other.
and
in
that
context,
this
court
said
that
opens
the
door
to
agency
interpretation.
so
in
order
for
the--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--automatic
conversion
does
not
require
the
filing
of
a
new
petition.
it
obviates
a
new
piece
of
paper.
that
is
the
purpose.
when
the
board
addressed
what
conversion--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--that's
common
ground
between
us.
automatic
conversion
means
that
the
old
petition
is
deemed
to
have
been
approved
in
a
different
category.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
a
couple
of
points
on
that,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
if
in
the
highly
hypothetical
situation
that
you
have
a
parent
who
has
immigrated
and
does
not
want
an
aged-out
child
to
come
and
join
them
in
the
united
states,
then
it
is
easy
for
the
parent
the
lawful
person
to
withdraw
a
petition.
also
the
child
cannot
immigrate.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
the
immigration,
the
ultimate
moment
of
immigration,
when
the
child
comes
in,
cannot
happen
without
the
parent's
consent.
the
parent,
under
a
provision
that
the
government
cites--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
conversion
can
happen
to
a
petition
in
the
f2b
category,
but
in
order
for
a
visa
actually
to
be
given
and
for
the
child
to
immigrate,
first
of
all,
the
child
would
have
to
provide
proof
the
parent
is,
in
fact,
a
permanent
resident,
and
would
also
have
to
provide
an
affidavit
of
support,
under
a
provision
that
the
government
cites
in
its
reply
brief,
agreeing
to
support
the
child
so
that
he
or
she
does
not
become
a
public
charge.
that
can't
happen
without
the
consent
of
the
petitioner.
so
if
there
ever
were
a
situation--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i'm
sorry,
justice
kagan.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
i
was
just
going
to
finish
the
thought.
if
there
ever
were
to
be
a
highly
hypothetical
situation
where
the
converted
petition
put
into
the
position
of
petitioner,
someone
who
did
not
want
the
child
to
come
in,
there
are
plenty
of
off-ramps
that
that
petitioner
can
take
in
order
to
avoid
that
outcome.
so
that
is
not
an
impediment
to
our
argument
at
all.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's
not
right
at
all,
justice
kagan.
certainly
not
that
they
have
to
be
ignored.
there
is
an
adjudicated
petition
on
file
by
the
u.s.
citizen
relative,
but
in
order
for
the
child
to
immigrate,
the
new
petitioner,
the
lawful
permanent
resident
parent,
has
to
meet
all
those
requirements,
which
are
assessed
at
the
moment
that
the
child's
visa
application
is
adjudicated.
that
is
also
when
the
determination
of
the
age
happens
under
the
child's
status
for
protection.
that's
where
that
conversion
happens.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
think--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--derivatives,
who
age
out?
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes,
justice.
the
answer
is,
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
visa
application
stage,
the
officer
who
is
adjudicating
the
application
has
to
ensure
the
qualifications
of
the
petitioner
to
make
sure
they
actually
are
a
u.s.
citizen
or
permanent
resident
entitled
to
petition,
and
the
qualifications
of
the
beneficiary
to
make
sure
that
they
have
met
all
of
the
requirements.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes.
derivative
or
principal
inside
the
united
states
or
outside
of
the
united
states.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
most
certainly,
justice
alito.
yes,
that
is
exactly
right.
and
the
issue
of
time
--
i
mean,
i
think
maybe
it's
worth
backing
up
and
talking
about
how
we
think
automatic
conversion
is
supposed
to
function.
what
happens
is,
you
have
the
petition
originally
filed,
it
gets
approved,
and
then
wait
until
the
visa
number
becomes
current
and
then
they
each,
each
beneficiary
has
to
file
a
visa
application
which
gets
adjudicated.
now,
that
could
be
adjudicated
in
one
of
two
ways,
depending
on
whether
the
beneficiaries
in
the
united
states
or
outside.
notably,
if
the
beneficiaries
are
inside
the
united
states,
they
go
through
adjustment
of
status,
and
there
is
no
claim
on
the
government
side
that
there's
any
obstacle
to
automatic
conversion
at
that
point.
why
is
that?
because
they
both
go
in
at
the
same
time,
parent
and
child.
the
officer
always
adjudicates
the
principal
beneficiary's
file
first.
it
will
approve
the
application,
and
then
the
parent
becomes
a
lawful
permanent
resident
on
the
spot.
and
then
nothing
prevents
the
officer
from
looking
at
the
child
and
saying,
while
i'm
doing
the
h1
calculation,
your
age
turns
out
to
be
over
21
under
this
formula.
nonetheless,
i
can
treat
your
petition
as
automatically
converting
to
f2b
because
you
are
the
adult
son
or
daughter
of
a
newly
minted
lawful
permanent
resident
parent
who's
sitting
right
here.
no
difficulty
at
all.
certainly
no
impossibility.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
two
answers
to
that,
justice
kagan.
first
of
all,
your
answer
to
ms.
goldenberg
was
completely
right,
which
is
that
is
not
the
approach
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
took
in
wang.
the
board
thought
wrongly,
and
the
government
now
does
not
even
try
to
defend
it,
that
the
conversion
had
to
happen,
if
at
all,
at
the
date
that
the
--
at
the
moment
that
the
beneficiary
aged
out.
that's
what
they
say.
they
say,
look
to
see
which
category
the
petition
converted
to
at
the
moment
the
beneficiary
aged
out.
that's
on
page
35.
they
tried
to
defend
that
in
front
of--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--it
is
--
well,
we
don't
think
that
is
the
right
date.
it's
a--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--well,
i
think
at
that
point,
the
question
then
becomes,
does
the
conversion
have
to
happen
immediately
at
that
time,
or
as
long
as
it's
converted
at
some
point
in
the
future,
are
we
still
interpreting
the
statute
in
a
harmonious
way?
it
automatically
doesn't
have
to
be
immediately.
now,
we
think
it
can
mean
immediately,
if
that's
how
the
court
chooses
to
interpret
it,
and
still
win,
because
we
think
the
determination
happens
when
the
adjudication
happens,
which
is
when,
under
their
current
procedures,
they
do
the
age
calculations.
but
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me
on
that
and
thinks
that
the
statute
requires
the
determination
to
happen
sooner,
all
that
means
is
at
some
point
after
the
determination,
the
petition
shall
be
converted;
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
has
to
be
done
right
at
the
time
of
the
determination.
i'd
like
to
back
up,
though,
and
take
on
the
premise
of
the
question,
which
is
that
h1
somehow
says
the
conversion
in
h3
has
to
happen
on
the
date
that
the
visa
becomes
available,
because
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
h3
does
not
say
that
the
conversion
has
to
happen
on
that
date.
it
could
have
said
that.
there
are
regulations
in
204.2(i)
that
specify
when
the
conversion
happens
as
of
a
particular
time
or
upon
a
particular
occurrence.
congress
could
have
taken
language
like
that
and
put
it
into
h3.
it
didn't.
all
that
h1
is
doing
is
setting
out
the
particular
formula
that
gets
applied
to
determine
the
age
of
the
derivative
beneficiary
for
purposes
of
subsection
(d)
and
it
sets
it
out
by
having
two
--
by
setting
out
two
numbers
that
get
subtracted.
first
number
is
in
h1(a).
the
second
number
is
in
h1(b).
and
the
first
number
is
the
age
of
the
child
on
the
date
the
visa
became
available,
and
that
is
reduced
by
the
number
in
(b),
which
is
the
number
of
days
that
the
petition
was
pending.
nothing
in
h1
says,
you
have
to
do
this
calculation
at
a
particular
time.
it
just
says,
when
you
do
this
calculation,
here
are
the
numbers
you
use.
but
the
determination
itself
is
a
matter
of
agency
procedure
and
under
their
current
procedures,
it's
not
disputed
what
happens
--
this
happens
at
the
time
after
the
visa
application
has
been
filed
and
it
is
ready
for
adjudication
when
the
officer
sits
down,
whether
it's
a
state
department
consulate
officer
outside
the
country
or
a
cis
officer
in
the
country,
sits
down
with
the
applicant
and
makes
sure
that
all
the
eligibility
criteria
are
met,
including
this
one.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
of
course.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i'm
not
comfortable
referring
to
your
honor
by
your
first
name
or
your
brother
by
his
first
name.
[laughter]
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
your
honor,
has
it
right.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
with
one
tweak,
which
is,
i
think
you're
positing
that
your
brother
and
his
son
are
outside
the
country,
not
going
through
adjustment
of
status.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--where
the
situation
is
a
bit
different,
because
then--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--your
brother
would
become
a
permanent
resident
immediately.
there's
no
problem
going
to
a
port.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
but
for
consular
processing,
--
i
think
what
would
happen
is
when
you
go
to
the
consular
office--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--judge
breyer's
application
would
be
accepted
and
the
calculation
would
be
done
for
the
son,
and
it
would
be
--
all
right.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
you
now
no
longer
qualify
as
a
derivative,
because
you
are
24.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
what
happens
then
is
what
can
happen
already
under
the
agency
procedures,
which
is
they
deny
joseph's
application
without
prejudice
to
reapplication
within
a
year,
which
they
can
do.
they
do
it
already.
judge
breyer
immigrates
to
the
united
states,
he
goes
over
to
the
port.
he
is
admitted
as
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
and
the
moment
that
happens
and
the
moment
joseph
gets
proof
of
that
happening,
he
goes
back
into
the
consulate
and
says:
all
right.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
no.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
mean,
we
have
two
arguments
on
this.
our
principal
position
is
no,
because
at
that
point
there
can
be
automatic
conversion
from
your
honor's
petition--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--with
respect
to
--
to
an
f2b
petition
on--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--but
that's--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--he
--
you
don't
need
to
a
piece
--
that's
where
automatic--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--you
don't
need
to
file
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
it's
done
constructively,
and
that's
what
automatic
conversion
is.
the
petition
is
deemed
as
though
it
had
been
filed
for
purposes
of
a
different
category,
and
even
in
the
situations
where
the
government
agrees
it
applies,
the
f2a
case,
not
only
the
category
changes;
the
principal
beneficiary
changes.
because
the
original
f2a
position
was
for
a
spouse,
it
converts
to
an
f2b
petitioner
for
the
child
or
the
aged-out
child.
there
is
no
reason
--
now,
the
government
asserts
that
there's
something
in
the
nature
of
the
word
‶
conversion
″
that
makes
it
impossible
for
the
petitioner
to
change,
that
that
is
somehow
a
barrier.
now,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
that's
the
case.
first
of
all,
the
bia
never
said
that
that
was
the
case.
when
the
bia
talks
about
the
meaning
of
conversion
in
the
wang
opinion,
it
says
the
conversion
is
used
when,
quote,
"a
visa
petition
converts
from
one
visa
category
to
another.
"
--not
a
problem
here
--
"and
the
beneficiary
of
that
petition
then
falls
within
a
new
classification
without
the
need
to
file
a
new
visa
petition.
"
nothing
about
the
identity
of
the
petitioner,
and
conversion
just
means
a
transformation.
there's
no
reason
that
a
change
which
can
already,
the
government
agrees,
involve
a
change
to
a
different
category
for
a
different
principal
beneficiary,
can't
also
involve
a
new
--
a
change
in
the
petitioner.
conversion
isn't
defined
in
the
act's
glossary.
the
ina
has
a
detailed
glossary
in
section
1101.
conversion
isn't
given
a
special
meaning.
the
identity
of
the
petitioner
is
not
mentioned
in
(h)(3)
at
all,
unlike
the
preexisting
regulation,
justice
sotomayor,
which
clearly
did
say
that
a
new
petition
has
to
be
filed
and
it
has
to
be
filed
by
the
same
petitioner.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
if
he
or
she
would
ever
wish
to
do
so,
yes.
and
the
child
cannot
immigrate
without
the
parent
taking
additional
steps,
most
notably
the
filing
of
an
affidavit--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--from
the
phrase
‶
automatic
conversion
″,
yes.
and
the
fact
that
congress
in
the
opening
clause,
before
the
comma
of
this
provision,
made
very
clear
that
it
is
to
apply
to
all
derivative
beneficiaries,
because
it
says
if
you
go
through
the
calculation
of
(h)(1),
which
everyone
agrees
--
even
the
vacated
panel
opinion
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
this,
and
even
the
government
agrees,
that
(h)(1)
applies
to
all
derivative
beneficiaries.
and
if
you
go
through
that
calculation
and
your
age
is
still
over
21
when
you
come
through
it,
then
your
petition
shall
automatically
be
converted
to
the
appropriate
category,
and
if
for
some
reason,
justice
scalia,
the
parent
has
a
problem
with
that,
there
are
plenty
of
ways
for
the
parent
to
stop
the
immigration
of
the
child,
although
i've
never
heard
of
a
situation
where
that
might
actually
happen.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
back
up
to,
just
because
we
have
at
chevron
step
1,
and
one
of
the
issues
that
this
court
indicated
in
brown
and
williamson
is
important
for
that
analysis,
is
a
modicum
of
common
sense
as
to
the
manner
in
which
congress
would
have
been
likely
to
delegate
this
particular
question
to
the
agency.
the
question
here
isn't
some
interstitial
matter
or
some
filling
of
a
gap
that
congress
is
not
likely
to
have
turned
its
mind
to.
it
is
a
foundational
question:
who
gets
the
benefit
of
these
mandates
after
the
--
the
automatic
conversion
and
the
retention
of
priority--
it's
unlikely
congress
didn't
think
about
something
as
basic
as
that;
and
if
they
did
mean
to
delegate
that
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
it's
a
very
strange
way
of
doing
it.
because--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
would
certainly
agree,
justice
kagan,
as
a
general
matter
that
the
immigration
law
is
confusing,
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
more
confusing
than
other
statutes
where
this
court
worked
through
and
found
the
--
the
ultimate
provision
at
issue
to
be
clear
on
the
question
at
issue.
and
here
the
question
is
who
gets
the
benefit
of
it?
and
we
have
an
opening
clause
that
is
undisputed
in
its
meaning
that
covers
all
derivative
beneficiaries.
we
also
have
benefits,
automatic
conversion,
retention
priority
date,
that
clearly
can
be
applied
--
possibly,
not
only
possibly,
but
easily
--
to
the
full
scope
set
out
in
the
clause
before
the
comma.
and
we
have
an
omission,
presumably
deliberate,
of
specific
limitations
not
only
in
the
regulations
but
also
in
the
v
visa
provision
which
we
cite,
which
specifically
call
out
the
very
group
that
the
government
now
is
trying
to
favor.
if
congress
had
meant
to
say
this
only
goes
to
f2a
beneficiaries,
it
had
two
easy
example
of
how
to
do
that.
it
deliberately,
presumably,
chose
not
to
do
that.
as
the
fifth
circuit
observed
and
as
the
questioning
earlier
in
the
argument
indicated,
if
all
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
do
here
was
codify
an
existing
regulation,
it
was
very
easy
for
them
to
say
so,
but
this
is
a
ameliorative
provision.
even
the
bia
acknowledged
that.
they
were
trying
to
solve
a
problem
that
happened
when
people
had
been
waiting
for
a
long
period
of
time,
and
not
just
the
beneficiary
but
also
the
--
just
not
the
derivative
beneficiary
but
also
the
principal
beneficiary.
i
mean.
the
lead
respondent
in
this
case,
rosario
cuellar
de
osorio,
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
emigrate
with
her
husband
and
her
family,
and
then
when
the
time
came,
she
was
told
you
can
all
go
except
melvin;
because
he
happened
to
turn
21
months
before
the
visa
number
became
available.
congress
recognized
that
was
a
problem
and
tried
to
fix
it.
and
they
did
fix
it,
clearly.
that
is
the
common
sense
reading
of
this
provision,
that
the
clear
language
up
front
before
the
comma
sets
out
the
scope,
and
that
congress
meant
the
remainder
of
the
provision
to
be
read
consistently,
harmoniously,
and
holistically,
as
this
court
has
said
it
always
does,
with
that
scope.
not
to
read
it
in
tension,
in
some
kind
of
irretrievable
hostility
with
itself,
which
is
the
argument
that
the
government
needs
to
convince
this
court
of
in
order
to
even
get
to
step
2.
now,
of
course,
we
do
have
an
alternative
argument,
with
--
which
is,
you
know,
independent,
even
if
this
court
were
to
agree
that
our
respondents'
children
are
not
entitled
to
automatic
conversion,
although
we
think
they
clearly
are,
that
at
the
very
least
there
is
another
way
to
read
the
statute
harmoniously,
which
is
that
they're
entitled
to
the
retention
of
priority
date.
that
is
the
main
benefit
that
is
provided
by
(h)(3).
it's
the
benefit
that
is
mentioned
in
the
inactive
title
of
the
statute,
and
it's
all
that's
needed
to
affirm
the
judgment
here.
and
again,
remember
the
standard.
all
we
need
to
show
for
our
purposes
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
language
after
the
comma
can
be
read
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
language
before
the
comma
that
sets
out
the
broad
scope
of
the
provision.
it's
at
least
possible
to
read
the
retention
language
as
an
independent
benefit.
congress
repeated
the
word
‶
shall
″,
meaning
that
it
is
an
independent
mandate.
the
object
of
the
mandate
is
different.
it
is
the
alien
who
retains
the
priority
date,
whereas
it's
the
alien's
petition
that
is
converted.
and
we
know
from
ron
pair
that
a
statute
that
says
that
there
is
a
duty
to
do
a
and
a
duty
to
do
b
can
be
at
least
read
reasonably
and
possibly--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--that
is--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--this
is
a
important
question,
justice
scalia.
i
want
to
make
sure--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--what
i
have
been
--
what
i
have
been
trying
to
note
is
the
fact
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
statute
that
the
government
is
trying
to
argue
is
hopelessly
internally
inconsistent.
that
is
a
step
1
argument
that
we
think
gets
rejected
at
step
1
because
the
statute
can
be
read
holistically
and
harmoniously.
and
if
there
is
any
possible
reading
--
this
is
the
language
of
brown
&
williamson
and
ftc
versus
mandel
--
if
the
benefits
after
the
comma
can
be
read
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
broad
scope
that
congress
said
this
statute
is
to
apply
to,
that
is
the
reading
to
be
given.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
this
--
i'm
not
seeking
deference
to
the
ninth
circuit
by
any
means,
justice
scalia.
i'm
seeking
defences
to
congress
and
its
plain
language.
and
that's
precisely
the
point.
now,
going
back
to
‶
automatic
″,
since
your
honor
wanted
to
focus
on
that.
i
mean,
‶
automatic
″
just
means
it
happens
without
any
further
interaction
by
the
--
by
the
alien.
all
it
means
in
the
regulations
is
that
the
agency
regards
the
petition
as
being
approved
in
a
different
category.
and
that
certainly
can
happen
in
our
case.
the
government
doesn't
actually
dispute
that
it
happens
in
the
adjustment
of
status
context.
they
just
argue
that
somehow
the
difference
in
petitioner
is
relevant.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
what
--
what
fundamentally
happens
is
that
the
petition
gets
filed
by
the
u.s.
citizen
relative,
and
then
after
it's
approved
just
by
basically
checking
that
the
relative
is
entitled
to
file
that
petition,
then
everybody
awaits
until
the
petition
--
until
the
priority
date
of
the
beneficiary
becomes
current
according
to
the
state
department
lines.
it's
not
as
though
there's
a
constantly
re-updating
to
see
if
anyone
has
aged
out
or
anyone
has
naturalized
or
anyone's
gotten
married
or
anything
like
that.
if
somebody
wants
to
do
that,
then
obviously
they
can
send
something
in.
but
it's
not
as
though
there
is
a
continuous
updating
of
the
file,
until
the
time
comes
when
a
visa
application
is
submitted.
and
when
a
visa
application
is
submitted,
then
it
is
adjudicated
and
then
all
of
these
things
are
checked
and
the
determination
of
age
under
age
one
happens,
and
that
is
the
point
where
the
automatic
conversion
is
going
to
happen.
and
as
long
as
that
happens
while
the
parent
is
already
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
there
is
no
obstacle
to
conversion
and
no
obstacle
to
it
being
automatic,
because
nothing
else
needs
to
be
done.
all
that
has
to
happen
is
the
officer
has
to
regard
it
as
having
been
approved
in
the--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--yes.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's
--
that
is--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
don't
think
so.
the
government
may
think
so,
but
i
don't--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
think
that's
certainly--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
way
the
government--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
way
the
government
has
been
applying
this
provision
since
its
enactment,
for
over
10
years,
justice
scalia,
has
been
to
require
everybody,
even
the
people,
the
f2a
beneficiaries
whom
the
government
is
now
contending
are
entitled
to
automatic
conversion,
it
has
required
them
to
file
to
get
a
new
petition
filed.
it
has
been
denying
automatic
conversion
to
everybody
and
it
did
that
up
through
the
filing
of
our
red
brief.
it
was
only
after
we
pointed
this
out,
a
week
before
the
government
filed
its
reply
brief
in
this
court
cis
issued
new
guidance
saying:
okay,
henceforward,
you
don't
need
to
file
a
new
petition
anymore.
as
far
as
i
know,
for
consular
processing
cases
they
are
still
doing
it
the
old
way.
you
still
cannot
get
automatic
conversion,
but
you
do
get
to
retain
your
priority
date.
they
are
clearly
implementable
as
separate
benefits.
that
is
how
this
has
been
done
over
the
last
10
or
11
years,
until
the
government
came
time
to
file
its
brief,
its
reply
brief
in
this
court.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
we
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
but
we
have
new
petitions
that
were
filed
as
a
protective
matter
in
these
cases.
that
--
that's
not
a
problem.
these
--
precisely
because
the
government
was
requiring
everyone
to
file
a
new
petition,
all
of
the
respondents'
children
in
this
case
have
f2b
petitions
pending.
we
don't
think
we
need
them.
our
primary
argument
is
they
should
have
had
the
original
petition
converted.
but
if
for
some
reason
this
court
disagrees,
we
have
f2b
petitions
there
as
to
which
the
priority
date
can
and
should
be
retained.
so
either
of
these
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
i
haven't
spoken
much
about
step
2
of
chevron
because
i
think
it
can
and
should
be
resolved
at
step
1.
but
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
that
--
the
response
that
was
made
in
--
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
at
the
beginning.
the
--
the
point
about
the
categories
here,
it
is
a
natural
phenomenon
of
these
categories
that
they
are
fluid.
people
are
coming
in
and
out
of
them
at
various
times
depending
on
naturalization,
on
marriage,
on
termination
of
marriage,
as
people
adopt
children,
as
people
decide
not
to
immigrate,
as
people
pass
away.
there
is
--
these
aren't
hermetically
sealed
categories.
also,
there
is
no
way
to
apply
(h)(3)
without
some
kind
of
movement.
even
the
government's
theory
of
(h)(3)
means
that
some
people
are
going
to
go
out
of
the
f2a
category
into
the
f2b
category.
and
so
the
question
is,
under
chevron
step
2,
which
again,
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
address,
has
the
bia
drawn
a
rational
line
here
within
this
group
of
beneficiaries
who
are
all
f2b,
all
children
of
lawful
permanent
residents.
and
the
line
the
bia
drew
is
it
says
we
are
going
to
say
treat
better
people
who
have
two
lawful
permanent
resident
parents
than
people
who
have
one
lawful
permanent
resident
parent,
often
two,
and
a
u.s.
citizen
relative.
is
there
a
rational
line
for
that?
the
bia
certainly
hasn't
provided
one.
