ms.
goldenberg,
before
you
do
that,
could
i
just
ask
you
to
respond
to
a
sort
of
different
hypothesis
of
what
congress
was
up
to
here
and
tell
me
what,
if
anything,
you
think
follows
from
it?
assume
you
think
that
congress
actually
was
not
intending
this
very
small
category,
that
congress
was
intending
for
this
to
be
a
pretty
wide
provision,
but
what
congress
was
--
it
was
laboring
under
a
misapprehension.
i
mean,
it
thought
that
you
could
do
this
kind
of
automatic
conversion
with
respect
to
all
of
these
people,
and
it
turns
out
congress
was
just
utterly
wrong
on
that.
so
--
but
congress
includes
this
language
about
automatic
conversion.
so
what
do
i
do
if
i
basically
have
a
hunch
that
that's
what
congress
was
thinking,
but
yet
the
language
that
it
adopted
talks
about
automatic
conversion,
which
is
impossible
for
many
of
this
category.
justice
elena
kagan
i
understand
that
argument,
but
that's
not
the
argument
that
wang
made,
is
it?
wang
suggested
that
if
the
--
the
appropriate
date
was
at
the
very
date
of
aging
out.
so
--
so
it
seems
as
though
you
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
chevron
deference
on
that
question,
given
what
wang
said
about
it.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
please.
justice
elena
kagan
in
the
usual
case,
a
petitioner
has
to
show
a
bunch
of
things,
right?
you
have
to
come
in
and
say,
i'm
a
legal
permanent
resident,
and,
you
know,
i
file
an
affidavit
of
support
and
show
that
you
haven't
committed
any
offenses
against
minors
and
all
of
this
stuff,
right?
but
you're
suggesting
that
we
can
just
ignore
all
of
those
requirements
that
usually
have
to
be
shown
at
the
threshold
for
a
petition
to
be
accepted;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fleming,
to
accept
that
argument,
don't
you
have
to
accept
your
understanding
of
what
the
appropriate
date
is?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
that
the
government
is
right,
that
the
date
is
the
one
that's
actually
specified
in
the
statute
which
says
the
date
on
which
an
immigrant
visa
number
becomes
available.
at
that
date,
the
parent
is
not
even
going
to
be
a
legal
permanent
resident;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
but
let's
assume
that
this
is
the
right
date,
the
one
that's
actually
specified
in
the
statute.
can
you
win
if
that's
the
right
date?
justice
elena
kagan
i
know,
but
can
you
win
if
it
is
the
right
date?
justice
elena
kagan
based
on
--
another
understanding
of
chevron
is
sometimes
congress
writes
confusing
statutes
that
point
in
two
different
directions
at
once,
and
then
there's
a
choice.
does
the
court
make
the
best
of
it
or
does
the
agency
make
the
best
of
it?
and
the
agency
knows
a
lot
about
the
subject
matter,
and
especially
this
agency,
and
so
irrespective
of
whether
congress
meant
to
delegate
something
in
some
very
self-conscious
way,
this
is
a
confusing
statute,
it's
a
kind
of
the
muddle.
the
--
the
agency
gets
to
do
it.
