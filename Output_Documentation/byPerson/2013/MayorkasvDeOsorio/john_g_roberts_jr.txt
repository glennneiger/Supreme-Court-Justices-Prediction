well,
it's
not
so
odd
to
say
they've
got
a
priority
date
in
their
pocket
when
the
statute
says
the
original
priority
date
--
they'll
retain
the
original
priority
date.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
hold
or
maybe
retain.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish

finish
that
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
