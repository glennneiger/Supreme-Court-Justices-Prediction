ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
reasonably
interpreted
section
1153(h)(3)
when
it
ruled
that
creation
of
a
new
petition
by
a
new
petitioner
did
not
qualify
as
automatic
conversion
of
an
existing
petition
to
an
appropriate
family-sponsored
category.
that
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
text
and
by
the
structure
of
the
statutory
scheme.
indeed,
it
avoids
destabilizing
that
scheme
by
displacing
waiting
aliens
who
have
long
had
qualifying
relationships
with
lawful
permanent
residence,
and
putting
ahead
of
them
in
line
a
large
number
of
adults,
aged-out
former
derivative
beneficiaries,
who
have
only
just
attained
a
relationship
with
someone
who
can
sponsor
a
family
member.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
your
honor,
i
don't
accept
the
proposition
that
it
would
only
make
a
difference
of
months,
although
i
know
respondents
have
argued
that.
it
depends
how
many
people--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
no,
your
honor.
it
won't
be
20
years,
but
it
could
be
years,
and
these
people
in
the
f2b
line
have
already
been
waiting
for
years
to
get
up
to
the
front
of
that
line.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
think
it's
mistaken
to
think
of
a
derivative
beneficiary
as
waiting
in
line
and
being
entitled
to
credit
for
waiting
in
line,
for
a
couple
of
different
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
derivative's
rights
are,
as
the
name
suggests,
completely
derivative
of
the
principal
beneficiary's
rights.
if
the
principal
beneficiary
never
becomes
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
never
crosses
the
border
into
this
country,
then
the
derivative
gets
nothing
for
the
time
that
the
principal
beneficiary
spent
waiting
in
line.
in
addition,
there
are
derivative
beneficiaries
who,
under
any
understanding
of
what
it
means
to
wait
in
line,
can't
be
conceived
of
as
having
waited
--
excuse
me
--
for
the
time
that
the
principal
beneficiary
has
waited.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
that.
in
the
(f)(4)
line,
someone
could
be
waiting
in
the
(f)(4)
line
as
a
principal
beneficiary
for,
say,
15
years,
and
right
as
they're
getting
up
to
the
front
of
that
line--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
apologize,
your
honor.
(f)(4)
is
siblings
of
u.s.
citizens.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
so
they
could
be
waiting
in
the
(f)(4)
line
for
15
years,
let's
say,
as
a
principal
beneficiary;
and
then
just
as
they
get
--
they're
getting
up
to
the
front
of
that
line
and
their
priority
date
is
going
to
become
current,
they
get
married
to
somebody;
and
the
person
they
get
married
to
has
a
17-year-old
child
at
that
point
in
time.
that
stepchild,
that
17-year-old
child,
under
the
definition
of
child
in
the
statute,
will
count
as
the
principal
beneficiary's
child.
and
if,
say,
a
year
later
the
principal
beneficiary's
priority
date
becomes
current
and
that
principal
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
immigrate
to
the
united
states
and
become
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
they're
going
to
be
able
to
bring
that
17-year-old
or
at
that
point
18-year-old
stepchild
along
with
them
as
a
derivative
beneficiary.
that
stepchild
did
not
wait
in
the
line
for
the
first
15
years
that
the
principal
beneficiary
was
waiting.
and
so
that
example,
i
think,
shows
why,
when
you
look
at
a
derivative
beneficiary,
you
want
to
look
at
the
end
of
the
process;
a
snapshot
in
time
of
when
the
principal
beneficiary
is
coming
to
this
country.
and
what
the
statute
says
is,
principal
beneficiary,
if
at
the
moment
you're
coming,
do
you
have
a
child
who
would
be
left
behind
in
another
country
if
you
were
to
come
without
them,
if
so,
bring
them
along.
but
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
look
at
a
derivative
beneficiary--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
think
that
if
--
if
automatically
converted,
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
if
that's
triggered
by
a
particular
event,
then
it
has
to
happen
as
a
result
of
that
event,
yes.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
right.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes.
it
also
would
apply
to
a
situation
where
an
f2a
petition
is
filed
for
a
child
as
the
principal
beneficiary,
and
the
child
ages
out
of
that
status.
but
i'd
also
like
to
say
that
it
doesn't
actually
apply
to
all
aged-out
f2a
derivative
beneficiaries,
so
it's,
perhaps,
even
slightly
narrower
than
your
honor
has
described.
it
applies
to
situations
where
they
can
be
automatic
conversion
of
the
existing
petition
and
movement
into
a
new
appropriate
category
without
a
change
in
the
petitioner.
and
so
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
discussed
before
regarding
stepchildren,
it
actually
will
be
the
case
that
some
aged-out
f2a
derivative
beneficiaries--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--i
don't
know
what
percentage.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes,
your
honor.
well,
before
i
get
to
the
question
of
the
numbers
and
i
can
give
you
some
numbers,
although
not
perfect
numbers,
because
of
how
records
are
kept
in
this
area.
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
keep
in
mind
that
what
congress
was
reasonably
interpreted
to
be
doing
here
is
picking
up
on
an
existing
regulation
that
was
targeted
specifically
at
this
very
group
that
we're
talking
about.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--there
are
two
reasons
i
think
why
they
didn't
copy
the--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--okay.
with
respect
to
the
numbers
on
our
--
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
18
in
the
footnote,
we've
given
the
best
numbers
that
we
were
able
to
come
up
with,
and
they
are
not
complete
numbers,
about
people
who
are
aging
out
every
year
for
as
long
as
the
state
department's
been
keeping
records
about
this,
which
is
not
all
that
long.
and
you
can
see
that
there's
a
series
of
parentheticals
there
with
respect
to
each
year.
the
first
number
in
the
parenthetical
represents
age-out
derivatives
--
derivatives
in
the
f2a
category;
and
the
second
number
represents
aged-out
derivatives
in
all
family
preference
categories,
including
f2a.
and
the
numbers
for
these
f2a
age-outs
are
not
tiny;
there
are
thousands
of
people
a
year.
in
some
years,
they
are
up
in
the
20
thousands,
and
so
it
is
not
necessarily
a
minuscule--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes.
there's
--
i
was
going
to
say,
the
first
number
is
the
f2a,
aged-out
f2a
derivatives.
so--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--no,
i
think
f2a
is
what's
relevant.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
that's
what's
covered.
and
this
is
not
a
full
universe
of
the
numbers.
these
are
numbers
kept
by
the
state
department,
but
the
state
department
is
only
responsible
for
half
of
the
administration
of
this
program.
there
are
also
people
who
adjust
their
status
to
lawful
permanent
resident
in
the
united
states
and
those
numbers
just
aren't
kept.
we
tried
to
get
them
and
weren't
able
to.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
it
varies,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
these
numbers
aren't
perfect,
but
i
think
it
gives
you
a
sense
of
the
universe
that
we're
talking
about
here
to
the
best
of
our
ability.
so
if
i
could
turn
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
about
why
they
wouldn't
just
go
ahead
and
copy
the
language
of
the
regulation
into
the
statute
and
why
they
didn't
just
say
f2a
in
the
statute,
i
think
the
reason
gets
back
to
what
i
was
discussing
earlier
actually
with
justice
alito,
which
is
that
actually
would
have
been
overinclusive
if
they
had
just
said
f2a
beneficiaries
are
covered,
because
there
is
a
set
of
f2a
derivative
beneficiaries
who
don't
benefit
from
the
language
of
section
1153(h)(3)
because
they
are
the
child
of
the
petitioner's
spouse,
but
they
don't
count
as
the
child
of
the
petitioner,
probably
for
a
stepchild
kind
of
situation
like
i
was
discussing
earlier.
if
the
stepchild
is
over
18
at
the
time
of
the
marriage,
they
don't
count
as
a
stepparent's
child
under
the
statute.
so
there
is
a
tiny
corner
here
that
would
get
carved
out.
and
actually
congress
did
a
very
good
job
in
this
statute
of
capturing
exactly
the
universe
of
people
that
was
captured
under
the
preexisting
regulation.
the
preexisting
regulation
required
there
to
be
another
petition
filed
by
the
same
petitioner,
and
automatic
conversion
to
the
appropriate
category
gets
at
exactly
that
same
kind
of
result.
the
other
reason
i
think
why
congress
might
not
have
specified
f2a
in
section
1153(h)(3)
in
addition
to
just
its
understanding
of
automatic
conversion
as
a
term
of
art
in
this
area
that
was
doing
the
work
that
it
wanted,
is
that
section
1153(h)(3)
now
functions
smoothly
if
there's
a
change
in
the
family-sponsored
categories,
which
has
happened
in
the
past.
congress
has
changed
up
those
categories,
added
categories.
and
so
if,
for
instance,
congress
were
now
to
add
a
category
for
grandchildren
of
u.s.
citizens,
then
aged-out
f3
beneficiaries
like
respondent's
sons
and
daughters,
could
automatically
convert
to
an
appropriate
category
and
section
1153(h)(3)
would
work
just
fine.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
correct.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
it
would
depend
on
how
the
priority
dates
were
working
between
when
they
were
coming
current
in
the
different
categories.
i
do
think
it's
true
that
the
aged-out
f2a
individual
would
go
into
the
middle
or
the
back
of
the
f2b
line
the
way
that
the
priority
dates
currently
working
out.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
but
they
would
--
yes,
i
suppose
that's
true,
but
the
person
who
ages
out
would
be
keeping
the
original
priority
date.
so
they're
not
entitled
to
more
than
that.
and
the
reason
congress
might
have
wanted
to
put
people
into
the
middle
or
back
of
the
f2b
line
and
not
right
up
to
the
front
of
the
f2b,
line,
which
would
be
the
effect
of
respondent's
interpretation--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--is
that
that's
extremely
disruptive
to
the
line.
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
about
that
because
i
think
it's
critically
important
here--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--right.
i
think
it's
the
language
that's
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that's
important
and
it's
ambiguous
for
the
very
reason
that
you
just
gave,
which
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
for
whom
automatic
conversion
to
the
appropriate
category
just
isn't
going
to
work.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
no,
but
i
think
in
a
situation
where
the
language
is
ambiguous
the
agency
is
entitled
to
deference,
and
deference
is
particularly
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
circumstance.
this
court
has
said
before
that
deference
is
particularly
appropriate
in
immigration
contexts,
and
i
think
if
any
immigration
context
is
appropriate
for
it,
it's
this
one,
because
very
delicate
lines
have
to
be
drawn
here.
if
someone
is
helped,
someone
else
is
hurt.
and
it's
something
where
you
have
to
step
very
carefully.
otherwise
there
is
going
to
be
real
destabilization
of
the
system.
and
just
before
i
turn
to
that,
let
me
just
say
one
more
thing
about
what
congress
was
thinking.
to
the
extent
that
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
here,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
thinking
that
this
would
sweep
broadly.
in
fact,
there
are
many
statements
on
the
floor
about
not
wanting
to
displace
people
who
are
waiting
in
line,
which
would
cut
in
the
other
direction.
so
the
destabilization
that
would
occur
as
a
result
of
respondent's
interpretation
would
be
many
people
--
and
we
can't
quantify
exactly
how
many,
but
we
have
reason
to
think
that
the
number
is
quite
large
--
would
come
pouring
into,
in
most
cases,
the
very
front
of
the
f2b
line
and
would
hold
it
up
for
very
significant
periods
of
time
and
perhaps
even
freeze
that
line
altogether.
keep
in
mind
that
in
that
line
there
are
only
26,250
visas
available
per
year
--
nothing
changes
that
--
and
per
country,
there
are
only
about
1800
visas
available
per
year.
so
if
you
envision,
say,
3600
people
from
one
country
coming
into
the
front
of
the
f2b
line,
every
single
person
in
that
line
--
that's
at
least
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
based
on
state
department
numbers
and
more
than
that
probably
if
you
had
the
other
numbers,
is
going
to
wait
for
two
additional
years.
and
if
there
are
more
people
who
come
into
the
front
of
the
line,
all
those
people
are
going
to
wait
longer.
and
the
equities
here
are
such
that
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
pushed
back
really
have
entitlement
to
stay
where
they
are,
and
that's
for
this
reason:
the
people
coming
into
the
front
of
the
line,
the
aged-out
f3
and
f4
derivative
beneficiaries,
have
only
just,
just
moments
before
this
has
happened,
obtained
some
kind
of
qualifying
relationship
with
the
u.s.
citizen
or
lawful
permanent
resident
that
would
entitle
them
to
family-sponsored
immigration.
prior
to
their
parent,
the
principal
beneficiary,
becoming
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
they
were
just
the
nieces,
nephews,
grandchildren
of--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
think
the
idea
is
that
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
pushed
have
had
long-time
relationships
with
a
lawful
permanent
resident
entitling
them
directly
to
family-sponsored
immigration.
they
have
been
waiting
in
the
f2b
line,
maybe
for
years.
they've
been
separated
from
their
parents
for
that
entire
period
of
time
most
likely.
and
what
respondent's
position
would
mean
would
be
that
these
aged-out
f3
and
f4
derivative
beneficiaries
would
basically
experience
no
period
of
separation
from
their
parents,
because
they
would--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
do
think
that
there
are
sympathetic
stories
on
both
sides,
but--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--for
the
reason
i
gave
earlier,
though,
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
think
of
derivative
beneficiaries
as
themselves
waiting
in
line.
i
really
do
think
that
that's
the
wrong
way
to
look
at
the
problem
in
this
case.
the
reason
that
aged-out
f2a
derivative
beneficiaries
get
the
benefit
of
section
1153(h)(3)
is
not
that
they've
been
waiting
in
line.
it's
that
they
themselves
have
a
relationship
to
a
lawful
permanent
resident
that
either
did
entitle
them
or
would
entitle
them
to
be
a
principal
beneficiary
in
their
own
right.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
do
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
phrase
as
a
whole,
but
i
also
don't
think
that
that's
what
respondents
are
arguing.
they
are
arguing
that--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
think
it's
not
automatic
because
at
the
moment
--
let
me
step
back
and
say
i
think
there
are
two
different
problems
with
respondent's
position.
one
is
the
question
of
whether
you
can
ever
have
automatic
conversion
to
an
appropriate
category
of
an
existing
petition
when
you're
subbing
in
someone
new
as
the
petitioner.
so
that's
one
issue.
and
then
there's
a
separate
issue--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--that's
true.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
i
think
that,
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
i
was
just
talking
about,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
you
can
ever
convert
a
petition
to
--
make
a
petition
by
itself
required.
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
new
petitioner,
the
parent
and
say
would
you
like
to
petition?
do
you
have
to
check
that
person?
keep
in
mind,
they've
never
been
checked
at
the
beginning
of
this
process
when
petitions
are
evaluated
and
approved
to
see
if
they
qualify
to
be
a
petitioner.
for
instance,
to
be
a
petitioner,
you
can't
have
committed
certain
crimes
against
minors.
and
that
will
never
have
happened
here.
so
if
you
have
to
stop
and
do
that
check
at
that
stage
as
well,
then
it's
starting
to
look
a
lot
less
automatic.
then
there's
a
separate
question,
as
i
say,
even
if
you
did
think
that
the
statute
could
unambiguously
be
read
to
say
that
you
can
take
a
petition
by
someone's
grandparent
and
make
it
into
a
petition
by
someone's
parent.
there's
a
separate
timing
question
that
the
parties
are
disputing
here
as
well,
and
that
the
board
ruled
on
in
its
decision
in
wang,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
moment
when
automatic
conversion
is
supposed
to
take
place.
respondent's
argument
is
that
it's
supposed
to
take
place
at
whatever
time
the
derivative
beneficiary
is
interviewed,
essentially
at
the
very
end
of
the
process.
a
consular
interview
or
an
adjustment
of
status
interview
or
evaluation,
and
that
that's
when
automatic
conversion
ought
to
happen.
but
what
the
board
said,
and
i
think
quite
recently,
is
something
different,
which
is,
the
statute
gives
you
a
date,
section
1153(h)(1)
gives
you
a
date
as
of
which
you
are
supposed
to
evaluate
the
derivative
beneficiary's
age,
and
that's
the
date
that
the
visa
number
becomes
available
to
a
parent.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
think,
as
i
read
wang
in
any
event,
that
it
says
on
page
33
you
get
automatic
conversion
if
the
beneficiary
is
21
years
or
older
pursuant
to
(h)(1),
and
then
later
in
the
decision
on
page
35,
it
talks
about
the
moment
the
beneficiary
aged
out.
but
that
i
take
it
to
be
referring
back
to
the
(h)(1)
determination
that's
been
made.
so
it's
aged
out
not
biologically
in
the
sense
of
turning
21
and
celebrating
your
21st
birthday,
but
becoming
21
--
over
21
--
21
or
over
under
(h)(1)
as
of
that
date
that
the
visa
number
becomes
available
to
the
parent.
i
think
that's
how
wang
is
best
interpreted.
there
may
be
separate
questions
about
whether
people
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
(h)(1),
but
those
aren't
being
raised
in
this
case,
and
that's
not
something
that
wang
itself
ruled
on.
and
so
i
do
think
that
there's
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
that
says,
getting
back
to
the
question
of
automatically,
the
moment,
the
key
moment
is
the
moment
that
you're
evaluating
derivative
beneficiary's
age
as
of.
and
as
of
that
date,
they're
either
under
21
and
they
can
be
treated
as
a
child
for
the
rest
of
the
process,
or
they're
21
or
over,
and
you
got
to
figure
out
what
can
you
do
with
them.
can
they
be
automatically
converted
to
an
appropriate
category
or
can
they
not?
and
if
not,
then
they're
out
of
luck.
and
that
is
a
way
of
reading
the
statute
that
makes
it
a
very
smooth
movement
from
one
category
to
another
without
any
kind
of
gap
in
eligibility.
and
it's
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute.
so
as
i
say,
i
think
respondents
really
do
have
two--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem
with
the
reason
they
gave,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why,
but
even
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
reason
they
gave,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
appropriate
to
send
it
back.
and
let
me
talk
about
each
of
those.
with
respect
to
the
reasoning
on
the
legislative
history,
the
way
that
i
read
the
board
decision
is
totally
consistent
with
my
own
reading
of
legislative
history,
which
is
to
say
that
congress's
overwhelming
concern
and
the
thing
that
congress
talked
about
by
far
the
most
in
the
fairly
sparse
legislative
history
here,
there's
no
pertinent
report
really,
there
are
just
a
couple
of
days
of
debate.
and
the
thing
that
congress
talked
about
the
most
was
the
administrative
delays.
that
was
congress's
overarching
concern.
and
congress
didn't
really
talk
about
(h)(3).
they
didn't
really
say
what
they
were
doing
there.
they
didn't
really
say
what
they
were
getting
up
to.
and
so
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
the
board
is
reasonable
in
saying
it
makes
sense
to
think
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
not
some
kind
of
big
change
and
destabilization
of
the
whole
immigrant
visa
system
in
the
way
that
i
described
earlier.
it
was
doing
something
pretty
small.
and
it
was
taking
an
existing
regulation
and
putting
it
into
the
statute.
and
by
doing
that,
it
could
be
certain
that
it
wasn't
going
to
cause
disruption.
and
it
wasn't
going
to
upset--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
no.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
there
--
there
is
automatic
conversion
for
self-petitioners
and
their
derivatives.
it's
provided
for
in
a
provision
that
preexisted
the
child
status
protection
act,
and
a
very
complete
and
total
age-out
protection
is
provided
in
that--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
congress--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--congress
added
(h)(4)
a
couple
of
years
after
the
child
status
protection
act,
i
think,
basically
just
to
ensure
that
battered
women,
people
who
are
subject
to
abuse,
could
get
whatever
benefit
the
child
status
protection
act
offered
them,
even
though
they
already
had
this
other,
very
good
protection
that
i'm
talking
about
against
aging
out
in
section
1154
(a)(1)(d)(1),
(1)
and
(3).
but
in
addition,
it
is
possible
to
envision
a
situation
where
a
self-petitioner
could
qualify
under
section
1153
(h)(3).
i
don't
know
that
anyone
would
ever
go
that
route,
because
they
have
this
other
provision
that
they
can
rely
on.
but
if
you
think
of
a
self-petitioner
who
is
the
child
of
an
abuser
that's,
like
an
f2a--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--exactly.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
respondents
were
trying
to
put
far
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
government
in
the
chevron
deference
case.
so
long
as
the
agency
has
arrived
at
a
reasonable
reading
of
this
very
complicated
statute,
the
agency
is
entitled
to
deference
here.
and
the
respondents'
idea
that
some
kind
of
internal
inconsistency
is
absolutely
required
here
is
wrong.
automatic
conversion
--
the
phrase
about
automatic
conversion
is
ambiguous,
and
it
renders
the
whole
provision
ambiguous.
and
let
me
address
the
idea
that
everyone
before
the
comma,
everyone
in
the
‶
if
″
clause
of
section
1153(h)(3)
necessarily
qualifies
here.
that's
not
true
under
respondents'
own
reading,
and
it
can't
be
true
because
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
someone
has
their
age
calculated
as
over
21
as
of
the
date
the
visa
becomes
available
to
the
parent,
and
the
parent
never
becomes
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
they
don't
qualify.
they
come
to
the
border,
and
they
are
not
let
through
the
border.
and
so
in
that
situation,
there
are
going
to
be
people
who
are
named
in
that
first
part
of
the
clause
who
would
not
be
entitled
to
automatic
conversion.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
no,
that's
not--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--it's
not
true
with
respect
to
f2a
derivatives,
because
they
have
an
existing
relationship
with
the
existing
petitioner.
they
don't
need
the
primary
beneficiary
to
become
a
lawful
permanent
resident
in
order
to
get
automatic
conversion.
but
the
broader
point
is
that
we
are
talking
about--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--no,
it's
not
that
they
can
come
in--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes,
your
honor,
but
they
don't
--
to
get
automatic
conversion,
they
are
not
relying
on
that
new
lawful
permanent
resident.
they
are
relying
on
their
existing
relationship
with
somebody
else.
but
the
broader
point
here
is
we
aren't
necessarily
talking
about
a
subcategory
of
people
who
are
deemed
in
that
‶
if
″
clause
who
are
going
to
benefit
from
automatic
conversion.
there's
another
example,
as
well,
in
the
diversity
visa
context.
diversity
visas
don't
have
priority
dates.
so
it's
awfully
hard
to
see
the
derivative
beneficiaries
of
diversity
visas
who
are
named
in
the
(h)(2)
definitional
section
are
going
to
be
able
to
necessarily
benefit
from
section
1153(h)(3).
and
even
if
you
did
think
that
everybody
had
to
sort
of
run
through
the
1153(h)(3)
analysis,
the
answer
you
come
up
with
with
respect
to
certain
people
is
it's
a
null
category.
there
is
no
appropriate
category
for
them,
so
the
category
is
nothing.
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
as
well
about
the
retention
issue
that
respondents
discussed.
and
the
implication
of
respondents'
argument
is,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
recognized
in
his
question,
that
somebody
can
get
a
priority
date
and
just
walk
around
with
it,
even
if
there
is
no
valid
petition
pending
as
to
them
and
even
if
their
parent
never
becomes
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
so
that
would
mean
that
aged-out
derivative
beneficiaries,
under
respondents'
interpretation,
would
be
better
off
than
children
whose
parents
never
become
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
they
would
have
a
priority
date
somehow
in
their
pocket
that
they
could
walk
around
with
and
use
20
years
later
when
somebody
filed
a
different
petition
on
their
behalf,
an
employment
petition--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes,
but
the
statute
is
most
reasonably
read
to
say,
as
all
other
automatic
conversion
provisions
do,
that
they
retain
the
priority
date
if
the
automatic
conversion
is
possible,
so
that
there's
a
specific
petition
being
identified
that
that
priority
date
is
going
to
attach
to,
and
not
that
you
just
somehow
have
a
priority
date,
which
is,
keep
in
mind,
a
filing
date
that
you're
just
going
to
kind
of
hold
and
walk
around
with
and
use
it
if
you
want.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
but
in
a
situation
in
which
the
parent
never
becomes
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
that
would
mean
--
that
would
turn
the
--
the
notion
of
a
derivative
beneficiary
upside
down.
that
would
mean
that
someone
could,
in
effect,
be
a
derivative
beneficiary
and
use
that
priority
date
in
the
future,
even
if--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
but
respondents'
argument
is
that
you
don't
need
automatic
conversion,
that
retention
of
priority
date--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--it's
the
--
exactly.
it's
the
separate
step.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
you
just
explained
exactly
why
that
can't
be
right
because
you
do
need
something
to
attach
it
to.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
exactly.
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
automatic
conversion,
if
i
could,
and
just
make
a
few
more
points.
and
one
is
that
the
idea
that
wang
didn't
say
that
the
petitioner--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--thank
you,
your
honor.
the
idea
that
the
board
in
the
matter
of
wang
didn't
say
that
the
petitioner
couldn't
change
is
simply
wrong.
the
board
very,
very
clearly
on
page
35
of
its
decision
says
that
conversion
means
that
you
don't
need
a
new
petitioner.
