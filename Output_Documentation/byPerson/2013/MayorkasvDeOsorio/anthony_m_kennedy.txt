justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
interpret
automatic
to
include
immediate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
--
that's
an
expectation
argument?
i
mean,
i'm
not
trying
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
but
is
that
the
point
you're
making?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
does
automatic
conversion
cover
someone
who
has
to
filed
a
new
petition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
way
this
works,
you
don't
have
to
file
a
new
petition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
everybody
knows
that
for
the
group
that's
covered
by
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
the
nephews,
that
there's
going
to
be
a
3
or
4-year
wait.
doesn't
a
new
petition
have
to
be
filed
so
that
bia
knows
that
this
person's
in
line?
