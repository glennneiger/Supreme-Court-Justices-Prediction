what's
that
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
those
of
us
who
don't
deal
with
this
as
much
as
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
give
the
subsets.
it's
not
just
the
general,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
mean
we
can't
correct
congressional
mistakes?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
under
--
under
her
theory,
the
--
the
petition
is
--
is
still
coming
from
the
same
person.
under
yours,
it
would
be
coming
from
a
different
person.
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
even
know
that
that
person
now
wants
this
--
this
--
this
new
adult
to
come
in,
much
less
go
ahead
without
a
petition
from
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
file
a
petition
in
that
person's
name
without
that
person's
consent?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that
this
automatically
gives
the
consent
of
that
parent?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
must
be
if
it
can
automatically
convert.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
you,
the
--
the
parent
will
be
deemed
to
have
filed
a
petition
for
admission
of
this
now-adult,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
but
the
parent
can
withdraw
that
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
this
flows
from
the
word
‶
automatic
″?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
all
upside
down.
i
thought
it's
the
agency
that
we
deferred
to.
if
it
can
be
read
in
the
way
the
agency
wants,
we
affirm
the
agency's
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that's
not
true,
that
if
it
can
be
read
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
would
like
it
to
be
read,
we
must
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sure
is.
i
never
heard
of
that
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
depend
entirely
upon
how
much
weight
you
want
to
give
to
the
word
‶
automatically
″.
i
frankly
find
it
hard
to
think
that
all
the
things
that
you
say
are
going
to
happen
flow
from
the
word
‶
automatic
″.
and
once
you
have
a
more
narrow
view
of
automatically,
it
isn't
--
you're
holistic
argument
does
not
carry
the
day
and
you're
left
with
an
ambiguity
that
it
seems
to
me
we
would
defer
to
the
agency
on,
not
--
not
to
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
possibly
qualify
for
b
without
qualifying
for
a?
how
can
you
retain
your
original
priority
if
you
have
not
been
converted
to
another
category?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
impossible.
the
two
are
obviously
conjunctive
and
not
dysjunctive.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
that
proves
is
that
you
need
either
automatic
conversion
or
the
filing
of
a
separate
petition.
but
you
obviously
need
either
one
or
the
other
of
those
two--
justice
antonin
scalia
--before
the
b
part,
"the
alien
shall
retain
the
original
priority.
"
makes
any
sense.
