mr.
clement,
there
are
--
zandford
said
that
“
in
connection
with
”
doesn't
include
ever
common
law
fraud
that
happens
to
involve
covered
securities.
so
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
what
would
not
be
covered?
what
fraud
involving
securities
would
not
qualify
as
in
connection
with
the
sale
or
purchase
of
securities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
up
to
now
that
you
are
not
defending
the
fifth
circuit's
test.
it
called
for
a
determination
whether
the
misrepresentation
is
the
heart
or
the
crux
of
the
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
aren't
those
rather
academic,
because
slusa
wouldn't
be
a
bar
to
them
anyway?
because
then
that's
class
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
contesting
at
this
point
--
i
think
both
courts
below
assumed
that
the
assets
included
stocks
that
would
be
traded
on
the
exchange.
you're
not
making
the
argument
that
it's
not
necessarily
--
that
maybe
the
portfolio
included
nothing
that
was
traded
on
the
exchange?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
you're
right
about
that,
mr.
clement,
they
also
said
there
was
a
representation
that
this
is
insured
by
lloyds.
and
there
was
another
claim
that
they
made.
so
even
--
even
if
you
are
right,
wouldn't
the
answer
be,
okay,
drop
anything
that
has
to
do
with
"in
connection
with
the
sale
or
purchase
of
securities.
"
we
have
--
oh,
we
have
a
claim
about
the
insurance,
and
we
also
have
a
claim
that
both
antigua
and
united
states
were
heavily
regulated.
those
were
false.
why
couldn't
they
have
a
complaint
shorn
of
the
incorrect
premise
and
based
on
the
insurance
and
the
regulated
aspects?
