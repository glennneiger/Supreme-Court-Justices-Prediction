mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
ask
you
to
write
an
opinion
affirming
and
that
it
adopts
the
following
rule,
and
that
is,
that
a
false
promise
to
purchase
securities
for
one's
self
in
which
no
other
person
will
have
an
interest
is
not
a
material
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
covered
securities.
the
other
side
has
asked
you
to
adopt
a
rule
that
has
never
been
advocated
by
the
sec
in
any
other
proceeding;
it's
never
been
advocated,
as
i
understand
it,
in
its
briefs
in
this
case;
it's
never
been
adopted
by
any
court
ever.
and
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
that.
their
theory
is
that
what
happened
here
is
that
there
was
a
promise
to
buy
covered
securities
that
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
someone
else.
that
has
two
textual
flaws,
it
doesn't
comport
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
it
would
have
extraordinary
consequences.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
conform
to
the
text
of
the
statute
in
either
of
two
ways.
covered
security,
which
is
what
the
plaintiffs
here
purchased,
is
a
defined
term.
it
is
a
security,
but
only
the
subset
of
securities
that
are
traded
on
a
national
exchange
and
some
of
the
other
additions
that
would
involve,
for
example,
mutual
funds.
and
so
congress
didn't
say
that
it
was
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
covered
security
if
it
was
a
covered
security
that
someone
else
would
get
the
benefit
of.
it
is
--
what
has
to
be
bought
here
is
a
stock,
and
instead,
what
was
bought
here
was
a
cd.
as
mr.
clement
says,
this
is
a
case
of
a
massive
fraud.
he
could
well
have
said,
this
is
a
case
of
a
massive
securities
fraud.
but
it
was
not
a
case
of
a
covered
securities
fraud.
the
plaintiffs
here
bought
something
that
congress
specifically
excluded
from
preclusion
under
slusa.
the
second
textual
flaw
in
their
position
is
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
jumping
off
point
is
that
there
--
is
the
defined
term
“
covered
security
”.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so
slusa
only
applies
if
there
was
a
material
misrepresentation
in
the
--
in
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
covered
security.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
congress
asked
you
or
told
the
courts
to
focus
on
the
question
of
what
the
product
is
that
there
was
a
misrepresentation
in
the
course
of
the
transaction,
in
the
course
of
the
purchase
or
sale,
and
that
is
only
a
covered
security.
it
is
not
some
other
product
that
has
as
a
benefit
an
interest
in
a
covered
security.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
actually,
i
think,
your
honor,
a
really
good
point
for
us
because
the
other
side's
argument
up
till
the
brief
--
excuse
me
--
up
until
the
oral
argument
is
that
it
was
a
misrepresentation
about
covered
securities
that
would
trigger
slusa.
the
problem
with
their
position
is
that
what
the
court
has
always
said
when
it
talked
about
the
definition
of
“
in
connection
with
”
is
really
two
things.
it
has
to
be
flexible.
we
have
to
give
the
sec
the
ability
to
deal
with
novel
frauds.
but
because,
metaphysically,
everything
is
connected
with
everything
else,
we're
going
to
have
to
draw
a
line.
there's
going
to
have
to
be
some
limit.
and
you've
pointed
out
that
it's
not
an
easily
administered
one,
but
the
--
the
bulwark,
the
one
thing
that
stops
10b-5
from
getting
completely
out
of
control,
is
that
all
of
the
frauds
involved
are
ones
that
the
court
has
recognized
would
have
an
effect
on
the
regulated
market.
that
was
true
in
o'hagan;
it
was
true
in
zandford.
now,
i
realize
that
my
friends
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
said
today
at
the
podium
that
they
can
imagine
that
this
fraud
would
have
an
effect
on
the
regulated
market.
they
did
say
the
opposite
in
their
briefing
in
the
case.
their
brief
at
the
cert
stage
said
there
was
no
possibility
that
there
would
be
an
effect
on
the
regulated
market.
and
so
this,
i
--
i
imagine--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
sir.
the
--
it
is
--
i
will
get
it
during
the
--
it's
quoted
multiple
times
in
our
brief,
but
my
colleagues
will
get
it
if
you
don't
mind,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
in
the
cert
pages
at
about
page
12,
i
think,
but
we'll
--
i
will
have
it
for
you
in
just
a
moment,
please.
and
they
said
there
is
no
--
the
--
to
quote
it
almost
verbatim,
there
was
no
prospect
that
this
fraud
would
have
an
effect
on
the
covered
securities
market.
the
second
textual
flaw--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
i
do
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
it
--
it
is
a
concession.
as
i
understood,
they're
--
they
seem
to
recognize,
and
if
you
read,
for
example,
their
brief
in
zandford,
they
say
that
the
sine
qua
non
of
their
ability
to
determine
as
the
enforcement
authority
here,
that
something
has
a
--
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
the
regulated
security
is
whether
it
would
have
an
effect
on
the
regulated
market.
they
wrote
a
brief
to
you
saying
that
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
think
that
that
is
their
best
hope,
and
i
don't
think
they
can
satisfy
it.
we
think
their
authority
is
narrower
still.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
securities
fraud,
in
our
view,
according
to
the
sec's
administrative
position.
no
court
has
ever
said
that.
so
that's
justice
scalia's
point
from
the
first
half-hour.
we
can
--
if
that
is
correct,
if
the
sec
is
correct
about
that,
we
still
prevail
because
what's
happening
is
the
broker
is
saying:
i
will
purchase
for
you
the
covered
securities.
that's
what
the
line
case
stands
for.
their
brief
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
and
so
the
--
the
critical
difference,
i
think,
is
in
the
definition
of
“
purchase
”.
and
that
was
going
to
be
the
second
textual
flaw
that
i
was
going
to
point
out.
and
that
is,
we
can
acknowledge
that
they
would
have
a
much
stronger
case
in
the
hypothetical
that
you've
described
if
the
covered
securities
are
pledged
to
back
the
cds.
this
happens,
for
example,
on
a
margin
account.
it
happens
if
--
there
are
lots
of
times
someone
will
say:
i
intend
to
use
your
money
to
buy
covered
securities,
to
buy
stocks,
and
i
am
providing
those
stocks
as
security
for
the
loan.
the
reason
that
is
securities
fraud
is
the
definition
of
a
purchase
includes
pledging
the
--
pledging
the
stocks.
that's
really
important.
and
it
tracks
with
the
court's
holding
that
“
in
connection
with
”
reaches
as
far
as
frauds
that
would
have
an
effect
on
the
regulated
market.
imagine
if
i
were
allowed
to
say:
look,
i
am
going
to
buy
covered
securities
and
you
now
hold
an
interest
in
them,
an
enforceable
interest
in
the
stocks.
and
if
that
were
not
securities
fraud,
the
market
couldn't
function
very
well,
because
things
like
margin
accounts,
you
could
never
have
the
confidence
that
you
would
have
the
protection
of
10(b)5.
the
critical
difference,
justice
kennedy,
is
between
two
different
cases.
if
--
this
case,
which
is
sib,
says,
look
--
among
all
of
its
many
misrepresentations
--
i
will
take
your
money
and
i
intend
to
buy
covered
securities.
that
gets
the
--
you
know,
putting
all
aside
the
difficulty
of
liquid
assets
versus
covered
securities,
give
them
their
best
version
of
the
representation
here.
but
it
was
only
buying
it
for
itself.
it
did
not
pledge
to
sell
the
assets.
it
did
not
give
the
plaintiffs
any
interest
in
them.
for
example,
the
interest
rate
on
the
cds
was
completely
independent
of
the
return
on
those
covered
securities.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
--
we
do
defend
that
rule.
we
do
not
think
it's
the
best
ground
to
decide
the
case,
and
i
will
explain
what
i
mean
by
that.
the
fifth
circuit
undertook
to
articulate
a
rule
that
would
govern
all
cases
in
which
someone
purchased
something
that
was
supposedly
invested
in
covered
securities;
so
including,
for
example
the
madoff
cases
where
there
was
securities
fraud.
madoff
falsely
sold
interest
in
a
fund.
that's
core
securities
fraud.
sib
never
sold
any
securities
at
all.
it
only
sold
cds.
so
if
the
court
believed
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct,
that
it
was
appropriate
to
decide
all
of
these
derivative
investments
--
if
i
could,
cases
--
then
we
think
you
need
a
flexible
term
like
“
more
than
tangentially
related
”.
but
we
think
this
case
court
stands
on
its
own
on
the
question
of,
look,
if
i
promise
--
if
i
sell
you
something
and
i
say
i
am
going
to
take
the
money
and
buy
cds
for
myself
and
those
cds
have
the
quality
of
being
liquid
--
now
you
don't
have
an
interest
in
the
cds.
i
am
not
pledging
them
to
you,
so
there
is
no
purchase
by
you
of
a
covered
security
--
then
that
is
not
a
securities
fraud.
and
i
did
want
--
want
to
get--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
two
things
about
that,
justice
sotomayor.
i
will
say
that
if
--
what
i
think
you
were
actually
told
from
the
podium
is
that
it
is
unclear
from
the
sec's
administrative
opinion
whether
the
persons
who
gave
the
money
to
the
broker
as
an
investment
were
actually
given
an
interest
in
the
securities.
it's
just
not
clear
from
that
opinion.
there
is
certainly
no
sec
holding.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
then
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is
the
sec
has
always
been
very
clear
to
you
that
the
key
part
of
your
hypothetical
is
that
it's
a
broker.
and
the
sec
has
said
to
you
repeatedly,
and
i
will
just
give
this
to
you
from
their
zandford
brief
at
page
23:
"there
is
a
particularly
strong
connection
between
fraud
and
securities
transactions
when
stockbrokers,
like
respondent,
misappropriate
securities
and
securities
proceeds
from
brokerage
accounts.
"
the
key
feature
is
that
you
can
understand
why
it
is
that
the
market
can't
function
if
your
stockbroker
is
making
promises
about
buying
and
selling
securities.
this
is
a
bank.
this
is
a
bank
that
doesn't
issue
covered
securities
in
any
way
because
it's
a
foreign
bank.
it
issues
only
the
non-covered
securities
that
congress
specifically
excluded
from--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
that's
market
manipulation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
the
first
completely
messes
up
the
stock
market
and
the
second
one
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
first--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--absolutely,
because
that's
the
sine
qua
non--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
it's
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
i
--
i
will
play
it
out.
that
was
not
my
intention.
the
madoff
cases
involved
the
following
scenario,
and
there
are
diverse
ones
and
so
i
caution
the
course
--
the
court
about
trying
to
lay
down
a
rule
that
will
govern
all
those.
so
madoff
engages
in
securities
fraud.
we
--
in
covered
securities
fraud.
he
says:
i
have
this
fund;
it
is
invested
in
stocks.
that
turns
out
to
be
completely
untrue.
so
we
know
that
madoff
engaged
in
securities
fraud.
the
madoff
cases
are
about
the
next
generation,
the
indirect
purchasers,
and
that
is
people
who
bought
into
a
fund,
and
the
fund
bought
into
madoff.
now,
those
cases
have
been
resolved
on
two
separate
grounds
that
may
not
be
entirely
consistent,
neither
one
of
which
has
any
implications
for
our
case.
theory
number
one,
and
this
is
by
--
in
an
opinion
by
judge
rakoff
just
a
few
weeks
ago
for
the
second
circuit.
he
says:
look,
the
indirect
purchaser
cases
are
covered
by
slusa
because
i
look
at
slusa
and
it
says:
look
at
the
allegation.
and
the
core
allegation
in
those
cases
is
of
covered
securities
fraud.
it
was
that:
i
was
deceived,
i
lost
my
money,
i
should
say
--
because
madoff
engaged
in
securities
fraud.
he
was
selling
air.
he
wasn't
selling
anything
at
all.
that's
not
this
case.
sib
sold
only
non-covered
securities.
the
second
way
they
have
been
resolved
is
that
you
may
be
said
to
have
--
when
you
bought
into
what
are
called
the
“
feeder
funds
”
that
--
that
in
turn
invested
in
madoff,
you
may
well
have
purchased
an
interest
in
the
madoff
fund
itself
and,
therefore,
you
were
engaged
effectively
in
the
purchase
or
sale
of
covered
securities.
that
is
clearly
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
from
this
case.
nobody
contends
that
we
bought
anything
other
than
noncovered
assets.
now,
i
have
tried
to
get
to
the
--
to
the
hypotheticals
that
the
court
put
to
the
--
my
friends
in
the
first
half
hour.
and
realize
that
these--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
sir.
they
have
not
even
made
that
argument.
they
say
that
it's
enough
to
trigger
slusa,
that
sib
bought
something
that
was
said
in
some
sense,
and
i
have
no
idea
what
the
rule
is,
to
be
for
our
benefit
or
to
back
our
cds.
but
the
only
--
it
is
categorically
the
case
that
the
only
purchase
or
sale
by
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
yes,
sir.
now,
this
is,
of
course,
a
significant
step
further
than
the
line
that
already
concerned
some
members
of
the
court.
justice
scalia,
justice
thomas
and
the
late
chief
justice
dissented
in
o'hagan.
and
this
is
a
very
significant
move
further
than
even
that
case,
because
the
emphasis
of
the
sec
in
o'hagan
was
that
that
kind
of
fraud
would
have
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
market
if
--
if
people
didn't
--
couldn't
be
confident
that
the
other
--
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
trade
had
material
nonpublic
information.
now,
returning
to
the
hypotheticals
that
the
court
put
to
my
friends
in
the
first
half
hour,
realize
they're
not
hypotheticals.
they
are
exactly
why
the
sec
is
in
the
case.
the
sec
doesn't
administer
slusa,
it
is
concerned
that
a
narrower
reading
of
“
in
connection
with
”
will
affect
its
ability
to
administer
the
securities
laws.
but
you
put
to
the
sec
the
question,
okay,
name
a
case
that
you've
brought
in
the
past
80
years
that
you
could
not
bring
if
the
plaintiffs
prevail
here.
name
a
case
that
you
hypothetically
want
to
bring.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if
he
does,
it'll
be
the
first
time.
they
filed
three
merits
briefs,
three
reply
briefs,
the
sec
filed
a
cert
stage
amicus
brief,
it
filed
a
merits
amicus
brief.
it
has
argued
orally
in
front
of
you.
and
so
far,
we
haven't
found
a
case.
now,
can
you
--
can
i
tell
you
that
i
can
imagine
a
case
that
because
of
my
rule
the
sec
can't
bring?
i
can
and
i
think
that
they
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
bring
it.
i'm
not
saying
that
our
rule
has
no
effect
on
them.
i'm
saying
it
does.
but
it's
the
lending
cases,
it's
the
prenuptial
cases,
it's
those
things
that
hang
over
the
economy
like
a
loaded
gun.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
my
point
--
my
point,
justice
ginsburg,
i
apologize,
is
not
that
those
are
affected
by
--
that
those
--
that
rule
affects
slusa,
it
affects
the
sec's
ability
to
bring
a
felony
prosecution,
despite
the
rule
of
lenity
on
the
basis
that
that's
securities
fraud.
really
understanding
the
consequence
of
this
case,
i'll
admit
to
you,
that
the
effect
on
slusa
--
this
is
kind
of
a
one-off
case.
they
haven't
identified
any
other
cases
like
this
under
slusa.
so
they're
adopting
a
very
broad
reading
of
“
in
connection
”
to
kind
of
kill
a
gnat.
but
the
reason
that
they
--
the
sec
wants
to
do
it
is
because
it
wants
an
extremely
broad
reading
of
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
"
they
want
to
be
able
to
bring
a
case
in
which
someone
is
alleged
to
have
purchased
a
non-security,
a
house,
issued
a
loan,
on
the
basis
of
some
statement
about
the
liquidity
of
the
fraudster.
and
that
is
never
a
case
that's
ever
been
brought
before.
and
so
it's
true
that
we
would
prevent
them
from
doing
that,
but
that's
a
good
thing,
not
a
bad
thing.
they've
had
80
years
to
say
that
they
need
that
authority
and
they
never
have.
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
way
in
which
we
lose
this
case,
notwithstanding
the
foregoing,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
justice
alito's
concern,
can
you
articulate
a
narrower
rule
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
that
says
it
was
the
feature
that
they
were
covered
securities
that
was
essential
to
the
fraud.
i
think
we
can
say
first,
that
is
not
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
right?
that
those
words
don't
appear.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
do
think
that
this
was
not
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
it
certainly
wasn't
material
to
any
purchase
or
sale.
but
the
other
thing,
justice
alito,
is
this
notion
that
--
that
the
feature
of
them
being
stocks
was
essential
to
the
fraud
would
be
true
in,
for
example,
a
loan.
if
i
say
to
you,
i
want
to
get
a
loan
for
$100,000,
i
promise
to
buy
for
myself
stocks
that
i
could
sell
to
repay
the
loan,
the
only
thing
that
was
critical
about
them
is
that
they
were
liquid.
and
remember,
that's
actually
all
that
sib
said
is
that
it
had
liquid
assets.
that's
the
only
feature
of
it.
and
so
if
we're
going
to
focus
on
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
are
not.
i
will
say,
however,
that
the
other
side
has
a
serious
problem
of
administrability
of
an
opinion
in
its
favor
in
the
following
way:
justice
ginsburg,
the
$7
billion
in
assets
that
sib
claimed
to
own
clearly
included
some
stocks
on
the
nyse.
i
think
that's
perfectly
fair.
the
question
is
how
many?
nobody
knows
the
answer
to
that.
and
if
you
are
going
to
rule
for
them,
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
face
cases
where
a
bank
says,
we
have
liquid
assets
as
well.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
not
essential
to
our
position.
if
you
agree
--
if
you
agree
with
the
sec
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
purchase
or
a
sale,
we
still
easily
win
the
case.
no
court
has
--
i
believe
that's
only
been
resolved
administratively.
and
so
you
would
have
to
decide
that
in
their
favor
in
order
to
win
the
case.
in
order
--
we
are
not
giving
up
on
the
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
not
the
ground
on
which
we
have
pressed
the
case
in
front
of
you.
i'm
not
trying
to
make
it
more
complicated.
it
is
illustrative
of
all
the
rules
that
they
need
you
to
adopt
that
no
court
has
ever
adopted.
remember,
on
page
21
of
their
brief,
which
is
what
you're
being
pointed
to
as
their
best
cases,
they
point
to
three
administrative
proceedings.
no
court
decision
of
a
district
court,
court
of
appeals
or
this
court,
and
it's
only
on
the
failure
to
purchase
point.
they
have
no
cases
in
which
the
--
the
core
features
of
this
case
are
present,
and
that
is,
you
have
a
fraud
that
would
not
have
an
effect
they
had
previously
said
on
the
regulated
market
whatsoever.
and
it's
merely
the
fact
that
it's
for
the
benefit
of
someone
else.
no
court
has
ever
adopted
it.
and
--
and
in
picking
up
what
this
court
said
was
so
important
in
zandford
and
o'hagan
is
that
it
has
not
been
the
sec's
position
in
the
past.
i
know
they
have
said
it
when
they
stood
up
today,
but
there
the
sec
assured
you
for
decades
we
have
taken
this
position,
it's
been
essential
to
our
enforcement
priorities,
under
section
10b,
this
case
is
completely
different.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
sir.
my
point
is
not
that
when
the
sec
says
it
that
it
becomes
true.
we
certainly
don't
agree
with
that.
my
point
is
they
is
haven't
articulated
--
before
they
said
the
opposite
and
today
they
haven't
articulated
anything
that
is
more
than
the
kind
of
metaphysical
go
from
here
to
here
to
here.
and
it
asks
too
much
when
we
start
from
a
statute
that
carved
these
cds
out.
congress
said,
we
have
this
idea
of
a
security.
we
have
this
idea
from
the
national
securities
markets
improvements
act
that
the
states
regulate
noncovered
securities.
and
so
we
are
going
to
say
that
the
preclusive
effect
of
slusa
does
not
reach
these
things
like
the
cds
that
we
leave
to
regulation
by
the
state.
so
this
case
clearly
falls
very
easily
within
the
text
of
slusa
as
being
not
precluded.
then
you
ask:
well,
am
i
going
to
stretch
the
language
of
the
statute
to
say,
well,
even
though
these
are
noncovered
cds,
because
securities
were
involved,
i
think
slusa
should
still
apply.
in
asking
whether
you
should
stretch
the
language,
you
would
say,
well,
what's
the
point
of
the
phrase
“
in
connection
with
”?
why
did
congress
give
it
that
kind
of
capacious
reading,
but
didn't
say
fraud
about
securities
or
fraud
involving
securities.
it
did
say
“
in
connection
with
”.
and
what
your
precedents
have
said
over
and
over
and
over
and
what
has
been
the
dividing
line
that
has
prevented
10(b)(5)
from
swallowing
all
fraud
is
these
are
misrepresentations
that
affect
the
regulated
market
negatively.
this
fraud
did
not
do
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
