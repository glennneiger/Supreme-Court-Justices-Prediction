justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
broad
is
the
word
“
benefit
”?
because
that's
really
what
this
case
comes
down
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
we
accepted
your
narrow
test,
which
wouldn't
address
every
situation
that
the
other
circuits
have
talked
about,
but
let's
--
let's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
that
was
the
madoff
situation,
which
was
different
from
this
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
the
line
case
where,
i
am
told
by
the
government,
you
were
trying
to
--
i
know
that
justice
scalia
doesn't
think
it's
important,
but
i
do.
okay?
if
someone
tells
me,
sell
your
securities,
give
me
the
money,
i
will
buy
securities
for
myself
and
give
you
a
fixed
rate
of
return
later,
i
think
that's
in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
even
though
it's
not
legally
purchased
for
my
benefit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
they
were.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
zandford
is
a
case
like
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
--
among
all
the
circuit
courts,
which
test
would
you
adopt?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
judge
sutton
in
the
sixth
circuit.
