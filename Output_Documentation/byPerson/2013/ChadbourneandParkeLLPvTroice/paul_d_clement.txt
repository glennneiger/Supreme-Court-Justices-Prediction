mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
stanford
ponzi
scheme
was
a
massive
fraud,
but
that
fraud
clearly
included
material
misrepresentations
about
transactions
in
covered
securities.
the
complaints
in
this
case
bear
that
out.
plaintiffs
allege
specifically
that
their
money
was
--
there
were
misrepresentations
about
how
their
money
would
be
invested
in
covered
securities,
that
the
misrepresentation
was
material,
and
that
indeed,
the
security
of
the
underlying
investments
was
the
most
important
factor
in
securing
plaintiff's
own
investments
in
the
cds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
certainly
agree
with
you
in
the
latter
assumption,
your
honor,
which
is
both
lower
courts
decided
this
on
the
case
that
the
complaint
specifically
--
referred
to
covered
securities
specifically
enough.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point
because
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
case,
but
i
will
say
i
do
think
there's
a
reason
that
that
was
not
a
contested
issue
because
if
you
think
about
the
securities
that
were
referred
to,
strong
multinational
corporations,
major
international
banks,
those
are
companies
that
are
traded
on
u.s.
national
exchanges.
also,
if
you
get
into
the
details
of
the
record,
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
want
to
look
at
something,
joint
appendix
page
746
is
an
attachment
to
the
willis
complaint.
and
there,
there's
a
reference
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
it's
a
translated
letter
to
investors
and
you
can
read
it
more
than
one
way.
but
i
sure
think
the
whole
point
of
that
paragraph
is
to
lead
the
plaintiffs
to
think
that
their
stock
--
they're
buying
an
interest
in
stocks
that
would
be
traded
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
particularly.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
would
depend
on
the
answer
to
a
question
that
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
a
reference
to
your
stockholdings
would
be
sufficient
to
--
to
come
with--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yeah,
i
think
that
probably
would
be
covered,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
that's
any
great
surprise.
i
mean,
this
court
held
in
a
case
called
reuben
against
the
united
states
that
if
you
pledge
securities
that
are
--
and
tell
the
banks
that
they're
valuable
and
they,
in
fact,
aren't,
that
that's
covered
by
the
securities
law.
in
that
case,
it
wasn't
just
in
connection
with,
it
was
actually
considered
a
constructive
sale
or
transfer
of
the
securities.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
that's
right.
i'm
just
saying,
though,
that
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
you
can
have
a
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
a
loan
application
or
something
like
that
is
all
that
surprising
in
the
sense
that
the
way
that
both
10(b),
10(b)(5)
and
slusa
are
structured.
the
“
in
connection
with
”
requirement
can
take
something
that
might
otherwise
be
plain
fraud
and
if
there's
a
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
a
security
or
a
covered
security,
that
makes
it
securities
fraud.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
--
with
respect,
i
don't
think
in
most
of
these
cases
anything
is
going
to
particularly
turn
on
that.
i
also
think
--
i'm
happy
to
answer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
there
are
lots
of
cases
where
whether
you
can
prosecute
a
fraud
or
securities
fraud
is
not
going
to
make
much
difference.
you
can
go
at
it
either
way.
there
are
circumstances
--
there
are
really
two
things
that
are
at
issue
here:
one
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
there
are
cases
directly
on
point.
but
let
me
be
clear.
our
theory
here
does
not,
by
any
means,
necessarily
have
to
extend
to
those
holder
situations.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
just
a
misrepresentation
about
holdings
of
securities.
it
is
--
they
are
misrepresentations
about
covered
securities
transactions.
and
more
particularly,
they
are
false
promises
to
purchase
covered
securities
for
plaintiffs'
benefit.
and
there
are
sec
cases
that
are
brought
under
those
circumstances
and
as
well
there
should
be.
because
when
you
sell
something,
whether
it's
a
noncovered
security
or
something
else
based
on
a
misrepresentation
about
covered
securities,
you
trigger
the
interests
of
the
sec
and
slusa
in
a
distinct
way.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
think
probably
not
at
the
end
of
the
day.
but
i
also
would
say
that
this
is
so
far
removed
from
that.
i
mean,
first
of
all--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
has
already
crossed
the
bridge.
you
don't
have
to
effect
the
specific
transaction
in
which
you
are
--
the
fraud
is
alleged
to
be
associated
with.
so
you
have
cases
like
o'hagan,
for
example,
where
the
actual
transaction
on
the
--
on
the
exchange
is
not
sullied
with
the
fraud
and
the
victim
of
the
fraud
doesn't
even
trade,
the
holder
of
the
confidential
information.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
i
disagree
with
the
premise.
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
the
only
way
in
which
there
isn't
that
kind
of
transaction
here
is
because
the
fraud
was
bigger.
as
we
point
out
in
the
briefs,
if
you
imagine
that
this
was
a
thing
where
they
said,
look,
we're
going
to
purchase
multinational
corporations;
and
instead,
they
purchase
domestic
corporations,
well,
then
there
would
be
a
transaction
that
would
not
have
otherwise
occurred
on
the
market
in
domestic
transactions
that
would
have
been
perfectly
analogous
to
the
kind
of
normal
transaction
that
took
place
in
bankers
life
and
or
in
zandford
in
the
market.
and
yet,
the
fraud
was
sufficiently
associated
with
it.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
wants
to
say
that
the
only
frauds
that
are
not
in
connection
with
are
the
really
big
ones.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
there's
a
particularly
close
case,
because
a,
i
think
the
sec
has
better
things
to
do.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
privately--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
--
i
think
probably
i
would
start
with
the
richard
line
case,
which
is
cited
on
page
21
of
their
brief.
and
what
that
case
shows
is
that
you
can
have
frauds
in
connection
with
covered
securities
that
affect
things
that
are
either
not
covered
securities
or
in
that
case
are
nothing
at
all.
mr.
line
was
very
clever.
he
took
people
who
were
interested
in
having
their
kids
go
to
college
and
needed
financial
aid,
and
he
said,
i'll
take
your
assets
from
you,
and
they'll
be
--
they'll
be
mine.
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
anything
in
return,
not
a
covered
security,
nothing.
because
the
whole
point
of
this
is
to
get
your
assets
off
your
books.
and
what
i'll
do
is
i'll
invest
those
in
the
market,
make
a
bunch
of
money
and
in
four
years
when
you're
no
longer
worried
about
financial
aid,
i'll
return
your
principal
and
some
of
the
proceeds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that
--
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
alito,
but
for
a
slightly
different
reason
than
you
may
be
imagining.
which
is,
i
think
one
of
the
mistakes
that
can
be
made
here
is
to
ask
in
connection
with
to
do
all
the
work.
and
the
statute
has
multiple
requirements,
including
a
materiality
requirement.
and
as
your
question
suggests,
if
you're
making
a
misrepresentation
and
the
whole
point
of
it
is
to
just
tell
somebody
that
look,
i
have
wealth
or
i
have
sort
of
assets,
i
don't
know
that
the
specific
nature
of
them
makes
any
difference.
but
in
a
case
like
this,
the
whole
point
of
this
fraud
was
to
take
a
noncovered
security
and
to
imbue
it
with
some
of
the
positive
qualities
of
a
covered
security,
the
most
important
of
which
being
liquidity.
and
if
you
look
at
sort
of
the
underlying
brochures
here
that
were
used
to
market
this,
that's
really
what
this
fraud
was
all
about.
these
cds
were
offered
as
being
better
than
normal
cds
because
we
can
get
you
your
money
whenever
you
need
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
doesn't
matter,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
i
indicated
earlier,
which
is
you
don't
want
to
draw
a
line
that
basically
says,
look,
if
you
buy
different
securities
than
you
were
supposed
to
or
you
sell
fewer
than
you
were
supposed
to,
that's
covered,
but
if
you're
a
madoff
and
you
go
all
the
way
and
simply
lie
about
the
whole
thing
and
there
never
were
any
securities
purchases
at
all,
that
that's
somehow
better.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think,
again,
if
you
want
to
start
with
sec
adjudications,
again
on
page
21
there
is
the
jett
adjudication
where
again
there
was
a
broker/dealer
in
that
case,
and
they
just
made
up
the
trades.
they
told
their
employer:
you
know,
look
how
i've
done,
look
at
these
great
trades.
and
there
just
weren't
any
trades.
and
of
course
all
of
the
madoff
cases,
or
a
substantial
number
of
madoff
cases,
fit
that
--
fit
that
categorization.
it's
actually
not
clear
whether
this
case
does,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
think
what's
alleged
is
either
there
were
no
purchases
or
substantially
less
purchases
of
covered
securities
than
represented.
nobody
has
really
thought
the
difference
between
zero
and
substantially
less
made
much
of
a
difference
in
this
case.
and
i
would
certainly,
like
i
said,
suggest
that
that's
the
right
result,
because
whatever
else
is
true,
you
can't
somehow
have
a
better
fraud
that's
immune
from
the
sec
just
because
you
completely
made
the
whole
thing
up
and
there
were
no
transactions
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
let
me
start
with
--
i
mean
--
with
a
hypothetical
that
zandford
used
because
i
think
it
helps
illustrate
why
even
if
coincide
is
the
test,
we
satisfy
it
here.
what
zandford
was
really
distinguishing
was
two
cases:
one
where
a
broker/dealer
gets
money
from
a
potential
client
with
the
purest
of
intentions
and
only
at
a
later
stage
do
they
say,
you
know,
i'm
kind
of
below
on
own
payments,
i
need
some
money,
i'm
going
to
embezzle
the
funds.
and
zandford
said,
in
that
context,
the
fraud
and
the
security
purchases
are
independent
events.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
look
at
this
case
and
say
that
the
misrepresentations
about
covered
securities
purchases
and
the
fraud
were
independent
events,
nor
would
anybody
say
that
this
isn't
a
case
where
from
the
very
beginning
there
was
intent
by
stanford
not
to
make
good
on
the
promise
to
purchase
covered
securities
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs.
so
this
is
like
zandford
itself
or
wharf
--
wharf
holdings
itself,
where
the
fraudulent
intent
is
there
at
the
very
moment
the
transaction
takes
place.
and
again,
wharf
holdings
is
another
example
where
this
court
says
in
dictum
that,
you
know,
it
would
be
one
thing
if
they
sold
the
option
and
only
later
independently
decided
that
they
weren't
going
to
perform
on
the
option.
but
if
they
had
that
intent
all
along,
they
clearly
coincide.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
there--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
couple
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
obviously
the
federal
securities
laws
apply
to
non-covered
securities
as
well
as
covered
securities.
so
the
real
question
here
is
going
to
be
slusa's
coverage
because,
as
i
said,
10(b)(5)
applies
to
non-covered
securities.
second
of
all,
this
court
is
well
over
the
bridge
about
not
requiring
that
it
be
the
plaintiff's
own
purchases
or
sales
that
are
what
the
inquiry
focuses
on.
and
that's
been
true
in
a
whole
line
of
this
court's
cases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
and
here
there
are
purchases
of
covered
securities.
they're
the
alleged
purchases.
they're
the
false
promises
that
i'm
going--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
anything
turns
on
it,
but
there
actually
were
some
purchases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that
has
been
the
case
in
other
cases
as
well.
the
security
transactions
in
bankers
life,
neither
the
seller
nor
the
buyer
of
those
transactions
had
--
was
affected
by,
directly
by
the
fraud.
in
zandford,
there
were
security
sales.
those
security
sales--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
and
--
and
the
plaintiffs
were
clearly
affected
by
this
fraud.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
again,
that's
true
in
so
many
cases.
dabit,
the
holders
didn't
purchase
or
sell
at
all,
but
that
was
okay.
o'hagan,
the
defrauded
party
was
the
company
with
the
confidential
information.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
simplest,
narrowest
way
to
decide
this
case
is
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
misrepresentation
and
a
false
promise
to
purchase
covered
securities
for
the
benefit
of
the
plaintiffs,
then
the
“
in
connection
with
”
standard
is
required.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
are
points.
first
of
all,
it
is
just
simply
wrong
that
courts
have
not
decided
that
a
purported
sale
is
covered.
the
grippo
case
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
we
cite
in
both
our
opening
and
reply
brief
is
one
of
those
cases.
there
are
others
consistent
with
the
sec's
longstanding
position.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
zandford
is
a
case
from
this
court
that
essentially
says
that
as
well.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
know
that
i
would
adopt
any
of
them,
your
honor,
because
i
think
a
lot
of
them
make
the
same
mistake,
which
is
they
get
materiality,
and
they
sneak
it
into
the
“
in
connection
with
”
requirements.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
and
i
think
if
you
were
going
to
accept
one
test,
i
would
accept
--
i
would
ask
you
to
have
the
siegel
test
from
judge
sutton.
but
i
do
think
it's
a
mistake
to
have
materiality
or
causation
slip
into
the
“
in
connection
with
”
requirement.
i'd
like
to
start
with
justice
kennedy's
very
apt
observation
that
this
fraud
here
is
very
similar
to
the
paradigmatic
securities
fraud
where
i
simply
--
a
broker
simply
says,
give
me
your
money;
i
will
buy
securities,
and
never
does
it.
and
from
the
perspective
of
the
defrauded
party,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
what
they
get
in
return
is
a
statement
that
says
they
own
some
securities
or
a
statement
in
a
feeder
fund
that
says
they
have
an
interest
in
the
madoff
fund,
or
whether
they
get
here
a
cd
that
they
are
told
by
the
brochure
that
tells
them
what
this
is
all
about
that
it's
backed
by
the
investments
in
the
securities.
they're
all
one
and
the
same.
another
thing
i
have
to
correct
is
it's
simply
not
true
that
the
returns
here
were
not
variable
on
the
performance
of
the
portfolio.
it's
not
really
well
developed
in
the
record
here,
but
if
you
want
to,
we
could
lodge
the
brochures
that
are
used
to
market
these
things
that
tell
these
guys
that
their
returns
are
variable
and
that
they
could
lose
all
their
principal
because
of
the
investments
in
covered
securities.
a
second
thing
is,
of
course
mr.
goldstein
correctly
says
there
are
particular
problems
when
broker
dealers
lie
about
covered
securities.
well,
so
too
there
are
particular
problems
when
an
unregistered
investment
company
lies
about
covered
securities.
and
that's
what
their
own
complaint
says
was
the
reality
of
these
--
of
the
stanford
investment
bank,
that
it
was
an
unregistered
investment
company.
that's
interesting
for
two
reasons:
one,
if
it
were
a
registered
investment
company,
all
of
its
securities
would
be
covered
securities.
that's
another
way
you
can
get
within
the
covered
security
vane.
so
this
idea
that
mr.
goldstein
proclaims,
this
is
not
a
covered
securities
fraud,
is
simply
wrong.
it
is.
it
was
material
to
this
fraud
to
make
misrepresentations
about
purchases
of
covered
securities.
without
those
representations
that
we're
going
to
take
their
money
and
we're
going
to
reinvest
it
--
again,
words
from
their
complaint
--
in
covered
securities,
nobody's
going
to
give
their
money
to
a
bank
in
antigua.
the
reason
you
give
your
money
to
a
bank
in
antigua
is
because
you
think
it's
backed
by
something
more
than
a
piece
of
paper,
and
the
something
more
was
purchases
of
covered
securities
on
the
market.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
i
can
answer.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
mr.
goldstein
was
quite
prudent
to
not
defend
the
fifth
circuit's
rationale.
so
the
fact
that
there
are
other
misrepresentations
should
not
mean
that
a
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
covered
securities
is
somehow
okay.
slusa
makes
clear
that
any
misrepresentation
is
enough.
now,
the
other
thing
i
would
say,
very
briefly,
is
that
they
may
have
an
opportunity
to
try
to
replead.
that
in
a
sense
is
the
next
case.
i
assure
you
that
we
would
be
arguing
here,
where
the
essence
of
their
claim
is
to
hold
the
petitioners
secondarily
liable
for
the
underlying
misrepresentations,
they
have
to
sort
of
have
to
take
them
all.
but
that's
the
next
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
