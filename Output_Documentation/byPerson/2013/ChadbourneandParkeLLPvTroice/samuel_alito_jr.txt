justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
justice
--
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
and
in
some
of
the
others,
it
seems
that
it's
really
irrelevant
in
whether
the
assets
in
question
are
securities
or
some
other
asset.
and
it's
also
--
and,
therefore,
a
fortiori
it's
irrelevant
whether
if
it
involves
securities,
whether
they're
covered
or
they're
not
covered.
now,
would
you
be
willing
to
concede
that
in
that
situation,
where
it
really
--
all
you're
talking
about
is
an
asset.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
covered
security
or
a
--
a
rembrandt
or
gold,
that
in
that
situation
10(b)
doesn't
reach
the
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
it
matter
that
there
--
apparently,
that
there
is
not
an
allegation
that
there
actually
were
any
purchases
or
sales
of
covered
securities?
it
says
in
--
the
statute
says,
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
covered
security.
"
and
there
weren't.
i
don't
believe
there's
an
allegation
that
they
actually
were
purchased
or
sold.
does
that
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
your
best
case
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
take
you
back
to
the
test
that
you
think
we
should
apply
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
test
that
mr.
clement
articulated
and
that
you
agreed
with
seems
to
amount
to
--
to
saying,
when
exactly
what
is
alleged
here
is
alleged,
that
that's
within
10b
or
10b-5,
that's
not
that
helpful
as
a
precedent
going
forward.
now,
the
test
that
justice
breyer
suggested,
whether
something
would
affect
investors'
confidence
in
the
securities
market,
i
don't
know
how
we
can
--
and
you
say,
yes,
this
would
--
that
would
be
met
here
--
i
don't
know
how
we
can
determine
what
--
whether
something,
certainly
of
this
nature
or
maybe
even
further
removed,
would
in
effect
--
would
affect
investor
confidence.
somebody
might
read
about
this
scheme
in
the
paper
and
say,
well,
you
know,
there's
a
lot
of
hanky
panky
going
on
with
the
sale
of
any
kind
of
securities
and
cds,
i'm
just
going
to
keep
cash
under
my
mattress.
how
do
we
--
how
would
we
determine
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
understand
what
the
first
textual
flaw
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
jumping
off
point
for
this
flaw?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
everybody
--
the
case
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
--
that
the
cds
were
not
covered
securities.
the
question
is
whether
it's
--
the
“
in
connection
with
”
requirement
is
met
by
the
allegation,
which
is
interpreted
to
mean
that
there
would
be
future
purchases
and
sales
of
covered
securities.
so
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
getting
out
of
the
fact
that
covered
securities
is
a
--
is
a
defined
term.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
doesn't
say
a
misrepresentation
about
the
covered
security.
it
says,
“
a
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
”.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
all
that's
in
the
text
of
the
statute
is
“
in
connection
with
”,
which
is
open-ended.
so
i
don't
know
what
you're
going
to
get
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
just
be
clear
on
your
--
your
position
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
to
be
an
actual
purchase
or
sale?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
your
answer?
yes,
there
must
be
or
no,
it's
not
essential?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
want
us
to
issue
an
opinion
that
says
there
has
to
be
a
purchase
or
sale,
and
therefore,
affirm.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
decided
the
case
on
that
basis,
it
really
would
be
a
one-off.
so
the
sec
today
has
told
us
this
would
have
an
effect
on
the
securities
market.
but
we
would
hold
--
we
won't
listen
to
that
because
at
an
earlier
point
in
the
case
as
interpreted
by
you,
they
said
it
wouldn't.
so
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
the
holding
where,
you
know,
because
the
sec
previously
said
it
wouldn't
be
an
effect
on
the
securities
market,
that's
the
reason
for
the
decision.
