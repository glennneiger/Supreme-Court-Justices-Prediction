i
--
i
think
there's
some
problem
with
whether
or
not
this
was
covered
securities,
but
i
also
think
that's
not
in
the
case
anymore.
am
i
correct
in
the
latter
assumption?

your
white
light
is
on,
but
what
is
the
simplest
formulation
of
your
test.
if
we
were
to
write
the
opinion
your
way,
what
--
the
test
would
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean
if
you
went
to
church
and
heard
a
sermon
that
there
are
lots
of
people
that
are
evil,
maybe
then
you
wouldn't
invest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
if
the
broker
says,
"give
me
$100,000
and
i
will
buy
covered
securities.
"
and
then
he
just
pockets
it
and
--
and
flees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
see
how
this
case
is
that
much
different.
they
say:
we
were
going
to
invest
in
cds
and
the
cds
will
be
backed
by
purchase
of
the
securities
that
we
will
purchase
for
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
exactly
what
i
would
like
you
to
think
about
for
a
second.
because
the
last
words
of
ms.
goldenberg
of
the
sec,
well,
if
you
win,
it's
going
to
seriously
hamper
the
sec
in
combatting
fraud.
of
course
it
wouldn't
in
a
case
like
this,
because
they
aren't
limited
by
covered
securities,
they
can
deal
with
any
security
and
they
did
bring
a
case
here.
but
they're
worried
about
what
you
say,
that
somehow
this
will
narrow
their
authority
and
they
quote
line,
which
is
debatable.
but
assuming
that
it's
debatable,
mr.
clement
will
have
a
chance
to
answer
this
exact
question.
and
so
you
are
saying
there
are
none.
and
line
is
debatable.
and,
therefore,
it
would
not
have
hampered
them
in
any
case
in
the
past,
nor
any
one
we're
likely
to
think
of
in
the
future
but
for
line,
which
is
somebody's
decision
over
at
the
sec,
and
can
be
argued
that
it
fits
within
your
definition.
is
that
really
your
answer
or
are
we
going
to
discover
mr.
clement
coming
up
and
saying,
you
forgot
about
da,
da,
da,
da,
da?
