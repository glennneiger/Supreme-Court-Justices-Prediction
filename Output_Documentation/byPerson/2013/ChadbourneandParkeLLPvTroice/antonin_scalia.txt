if
they
were
covered
securities,
right?
i
mean,
you're
--
you're
pledging
covered
securities
to
the
bank
and
make
a
misrepresentation
about
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
assumed
that
the
purpose
of
the
securities
laws
was
to
protect
the
purchasers
and
sellers
of
the
covered
securities.
there
is
no
purchaser
or
cover
--
or
seller
of
a
covered
security
involved
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
a
purchaser
of
not-covered
securities
who
is
being
defrauded,
if
anyone.
why
--
why
would
the
federal
securities
law
protect
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
plaintiff's,
but
it
has
to
be
somebody's.
justice
antonin
scalia
nonexistent
purchases,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
line's
not
a
case
of
ours,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
case
of
any
court,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
one
of
your
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
we
don't
have
to
agree
with
all
of
your
cases,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
troubles
me,
ms.
goldenberg,
is
not
the
problem
of
our
figuring
out
these
economic
consequences,
but
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
says,
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
one
of
the
covered
securities.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
been
no
purchase
or
sale
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
be
in
connection
with
a
purchase
or
sale
that
has
never
occurred.
i
mean,
it
could
be
have
read
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale,
or
the
promised
purchase
or
sale,
or
the
contemplated
purchase
or
sale,
but
it
doesn't.
it
says,
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale.
"
i
don't
know
how
you
can
make
that
stick
to
a
situation
where
there
has
been
no
purchase
or
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
and
--
and
if
that's
--
if
that's
wrong,
you
acknowledge
you
don't
win?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
okay.
so
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
really
don't
agree
with
that
anyway.
