ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
narrow
formulation
that
mr.
clement
just
gave,
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
that
it
involves
a
false
promise
to
purchase
covered
securities
using
the
fraud
victims'
money
in
a
way
that
they
are
told
is
going
to
benefit
them,
and
that
that
is
a
classic
securities
fraud.
their
question--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
think--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--i
think
it's
clear
that
“
benefit
”
isn't
restricted
merely
to
ownership
of
the
securities
themselves.
and
i
would
point
to--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
don't
think
the
madoff
situation
is
particularly
different
from
this
one.
in
madoff,
there
were
feeder
funds
that
people
were
buying
into
that
were
non-covered
securities.
and
what
they
were
being
told
is
that
the
money
that
was
being
put
into
the
feeder
fund
was
then
going
to
go
on
and
be
used
to
purchase
covered
securities
that
they
themselves
were
not
going
to
have
an
ownership
interest
in,
but
that
the
benefit
of
those
purchases
was
going
to
be
passed
back
to
them
through
this
intermediate
layer.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
actually--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
actually
think
that
the
line
case
is
much
more
analogous
to
this
case
than
your
honor
is
suggesting,
because
what
was
happening
in
line
is
the
--
what
the
broker
said
to
the
victims
was:
you
have
children
who
are
going
to
college,
you
don't
want
to
have
this
money
around
because
you
want
to
be
able
to
get
financial
aid,
so
give
the
money
to
me,
and
in
several
years
i
will
give
that
money
back
to
you
with--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--your
honor,
just
to
return
to
line
for
a
moment,
and
then
i'd
like
to
address
sort
of
how
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws
are
implicated
in
a
situation
like
this,
in
line,
what
the
victims
were
told
was
that
they
were
going
to
be
given
the
money
back
after
four
years
had
passed
with
interest
calculated
above
market
rate.
so
they
are
not
being
told
that
they
were
going
to
be
given
whatever
profit
is
made
on
a
securities
transaction,
or,
as
i
read
line,
although
it's
slightly
sparse
on
its
facts,
that
they're
going
to
be
the
owners
of
the
securities
or
have
an
ownership
interest
in
any
way.
and
so
i
do
think
it
is
cases
like
line
that
are
at
the
margin--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
it
is
an
sec--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
certainly
not,
although
we
do
think
that
the
sec's
expert
view
in
a
formal
adjudication
may
warrant
some
deference.
but--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes,
i
think
so.
because
i
think
that
here
there
is
a
major
effect
on
investor
confidence
and
investor
confidence
specifically
with
respect
to
covered
securities
in
several
different
ways.
if
people
see
that
lies
of
the
kind
here
where
someone
is
telling
someone
else
i'm
going
to
buy
covered
securities
and
it's
going
to
benefit
you
are
being
made
and
those
lies
are
--
are
--
well,
that's
a
fraud
on
the
victims,
then
i
think
people
are
less
likely
to
go
to
their
broker
and
say
here's
some
money,
go
out
on
the
market
and
buy
me
some
securities.
it's
a
--
it's
a
lie
that
goes
to
the
mechanism
by
which
the
securities
markets
operate,
which
is
the
purchases
and
sales,
and
it
makes
it
less
likely
for
people
to
be
willing
to
believe
that
when
they
engage
in
purchases
and
sales,
that
something's
really
is
going
to
happen,
and
the
person
is
going
to
respond--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
but
this
is
much
more
particular,
again,
to
the
mechanism
by
which
the
securities
markets
operate.
and
i
think
another
way
to
look
at
it
is
just
to
imagine
the
honest
version
of
stanford.
if
someone
honestly
said
to
cd
purchasers,
give
me
your
money
and
i'm
going
to
put
it
into
covered
securities
and
people
invested
in
that
scheme,
then
that
would
pump
money
into
the
covered
securities
markets.
but
now
people
are
much
less
likely
to
invest
in
a
scheme
like
that.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
i
think
it's
true
that
the
sec
would
continue
to
have
tools,
but
i
do
think--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--no,
that's
fine.
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
particular
effect
on
investor
confidence
and
the
integrity
of
the
markets,
which
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws.
and
with
respect
to
slusa,
the
purpose
of
slusa
is
to
try
to
stop
people
from
going
around
the
requirements
of
the
pslra
and
some
of
the
limitations
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
i
think
that
purpose
is
--
is
at
issue
here
as
well.
i'd
also
like
to
talk
a
little
bit,
if
i
could,
about
the
issue
that
was
raised
earlier
about
whether
an
actual
purchase
or
sale
needed
to
be
made,
or
whether
a
purported
or
intended
purchase
or
sale
is
sufficient.
and
i
think
that
practically
from
the
moment
that
the
'33
and
'34
act
went
into
place,
there's
been
a
consensus
in
the
lower
courts
--
and
the
sec
has
said
this
as
well
--
that
a
purported
or
intended
purchase
or
sale
is
sufficient,
and
it's
for
the
reason
that
mr.
clement
gave
that
otherwise,
you
have
these
home
run,
egregious
frauds
where
someone
is,
instead
of
saying
i'm
going
to
buy
this
less
risky
thing
and
then
buying
a
riskier
thing,
someone
says
i'm
going
to
buy
securities
and
then
doesn't
buy
them
at
all
and
absconds
with
the
money,
and
that
that
is
something
--
a
situation
that
has
to
be
--
has
to
be
covered.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
sure.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
for
the
reasons
that
i
gave
earlier,
which
is
that
this
goes
to
the
purchase/sale
mechanism,
and
that
we
know
that
people
have
to
have
confidence
in
that
order
--
in
order
for
the
securities
markets
to
work.
it
may
well
be
that
people
also,
you
know,
lack
confidence
in
other
things,
but
that
is
the
thing
that's
the
particular
problem
and
the
thing
that
the
securities
laws
are
aimed
at.
and
i
know
petitioner--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
there's
been
a
purported
purchase.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
it
also
doesn't
say
the
consummated
purchase
or
sale.
and
so
i
think
the
purported,
intended,
consummated,
all
those
things
are
swept
up
in
the
text.
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
way
that
you
would
use
the
phrase
in
ordinary
life.
if
i
were
going
to
go
to
my
real
estate
brokers
to
sell
my
house,
i
might
gather
up
a
bunch
of
documents,
i
might
show
up
at
the
office
at
a
certain
time
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
my
house.
and
even
if
the
sale
falls
through
and
there
is
no
consummated
contract,
i've
still
done
those
things
in
connection
with
the
sale.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
courts
and
the
sec
have
consistently
taken
that
position,
and
if
it
weren't,
if
that
weren't
the
case,
then
egregious
frauds
would
go
unremedied
and
that
would
be
a
tremendous
problem.
