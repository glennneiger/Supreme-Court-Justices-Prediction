justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
goodness.
are
there
cases
where
they
brought
such
things?
i
mean,
every
state
has
laws
that
forbid
fraud.
and
mortgages
are
probably
--
and
loans
are
probably
made
in
the
billions
every
year.
all
it
takes
is
someone
to
say
on
his
sheet
of
listing
assets
to
have
a
covered
security
and
say,
don't
worry,
i'll
hold
these.
i'll
hold
them.
or
don't
worry,
i
will
sell
this
one
and
buy
that
one.
don't
worry,
i'll
buy
another
one.
i
won't
--
i
won't
put
up
the
security
of
my
sprinkler
system.
i
will
sell
the
sprinkler
system
and
use
it
to
buy
a
--
a
covered
exchange.
i
guess
if
those
fall
within
the
securities
laws,
we
would
have
expected
to
see
billions
of
actions.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
what
you
think,
but
i
need
to
know
why
you
think
it.
if
there
are
billion
--
if
i'm
right
in
my
--
what
i
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me
a
case
where
the
sec
has
ever
--
there
may
be
such
cases
--
but
what
is
done
is
somebody
has
simply
tried
to
get
a
loan
and
he
put
on
that
sheet
of
paper
listing
assets
a
covered
security.
and
he
said,
i
intend
to
keep
it.
or
he
said,
you
know,
i
will
buy
some
more
or
i'll
sell
it
and
buy
some
more
or,
you
know,
or
put
in
your
three
things.
just
list
the
case
where
they've
ever
prosecuted
that
as
a
securities
fraud
or
private
people
have.
after
all,
it's
beneficial
sometimes
for
private
people.
what
are
the
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
case?
what
is
the
specific
case,
private
or
sec,
that
comes
the
closest
--
i
grant
you
there
is
none
direct
--
but
comes
the
closest
to
justice
kagan's
hypothetical,
if
you
marry
me,
i
will
sell
my
ibm
stock?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
try--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
sec's
closest
case,
but
they
may
be
better
at
answering
this.
what
is
their
closest
case
to
the
horribles
that
they
foresee
if
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
--
the
case
that
he
says
--
i'm
quite
interested
in
your
reaction
to
which
cases
that
you've
ever
brought
this
would,
if
you
lose
here
would
prevent
you
from
bringing,
and
line
was
the
one
that
because
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
line,
there
is
a
broker
who
says
to
a
client:
give
me
some
money
and
i
will
buy
some
securities
on
the
exchange
for
you.
and
they
gave
him
the
money,
and
he
didn't.
well,
that's
directly
related
to
a
promise
that
is
going
to
effect
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security
directly.
he's
promising
someone
to
buy
securities
for
his
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
that
that's
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
say:
i
will
buy
them
for
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
can
understand
how
a
promise
to
buy
securities
for
you
is
a
promise
to
a
person
or
a
statement
that
would
lead
a
person
to
take
a
position.
whether
it's
this
plaintiff
or
someone
in
the
world,
it
would
lead
someone
in
the
world
to
take
a
position.
what
your
opponents
say
is
that
is
what
is
present
--
not
present
here;
neither
the
person
who
is
giving
the
money
nor
anyone
else,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
defendant,
is
being
led
by
this
statement
to
take
a
position
in
a
market
for,
buy,
against,
sell,
or
even,
if
you
like,
not
sell
or
buy,
hold.
i'll
throw
that
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
suppose
jay
fisk
gets
into
his
horse
and
carriage,
drives
up
and
down
wall
street,
and
says:
"i'm
going
to
buy
union
pacific
!
"
"i'm
going
to
buy
union
pacific.
"
knowing
that
people
will
in
fact
all
run
out
and
buy
it
quickly,
and
what
he
really
intends
to
do
is
when
it
comes
out
he
didn't,
he's
going
to
sell
outright.
anyway,
typical
fraud.
now,
that
is
certainly
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
now,
here,
what
we
have
is
mr.
stanford,
i
guess,
saying
to
people:
"i'm
going
to
buy
securities,
i'm
going
to
buy
securities.
"
and
maybe
he
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
like
jay
fisk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
does
the
first
within
and
not
the
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
they
had
done
exactly
the
same
thing
but
with
an
intent
or
--
or
maybe
and
the
affect
of
a
purchaser
of
stock
or
a
seller
of
stock
reacting
to
the
statement,
then
it
affects
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
where
neither
of
those
is
present,
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
