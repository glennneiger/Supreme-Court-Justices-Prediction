chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-79,
chadbourne
&
parke
v.
troice
in
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
--
if
i'm
trying
to
get
a
home
loan
and
they
ask
you
what
assets
you
have
and
i
list
a
couple
of
stocks
and,
in
fact,
it's
fraudulent,
i
don't
own
them,
that's
a
covered
transaction,
that's
a
10(b)(5)
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
only
element
of
fraud
in
there
was
by
the
bank
itself.
they're
the
only
ones
whose
purchases
or
sales
could
be
said
to
have
been
affected
by
the
misrepresentation.
and
of
course,
they
can't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--make
any
claim
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
somebody
else
--
somebody
else
was,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
by
the
purchase
or
sale,
right?
they
were
affected,
according
to
your
theory,
by
the
fact
that,
oh,
they
told
us
there
were
these
stocks.
but
the
actual
purchases
and
sales,
the
fraud
did
not
go
to
the
purchase
and
sales
of
the
covered
securities;
it
went
to
the
cds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
goldenberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
nobody
is
suggesting
that
the
sec
can't
take
action
with
respect
to
the
noncovered
securities.
so,
to
the
extent
there's
diminished
confidence
in
the
securities
markets,
the
sec
has
all
the
tools
available
to
address
that.
the
question
is
the
different
one
under
slusa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
in
fact,
this
--
it
would
inspire
confidence
to
the
extent
that
lawyers
can
bring
these
actions
as
opposed
to
having
them
precluded,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
for.
i'm
sorry
i
interrupted
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
--
can
you
just
give
me
the
page
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
it's
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--about
30
seconds
behind
you.
nobody
contends
that
you
bought
anything
other
than
non-covered
assets?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
there
was
an
allegation
that
you
were
purchasing
and
selling
covered
assets.
the
ones
that
were
misrepresented
to
be
backing
cds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
by
sib.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
