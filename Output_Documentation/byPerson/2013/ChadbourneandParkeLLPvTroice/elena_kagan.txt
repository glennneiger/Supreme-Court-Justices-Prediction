justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
you
say
you're
going
to
pay
off
the
loan
by
selling
some
stockholdings
eventually.
justice
elena
kagan
what
if
people
reach
a
prenuptial
agreement
and
as
part
of
the
prenuptial
agreement
they
agree
that
in
a
year,
one
party
to
the
marriage
is
going
to
sell
as
many
shares
of
google
stock
and
buy
a
home
with
it.
is
that
covered
by
the
securities
laws
now?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
is
it
removed
from
that?
because
it
has
the
same
structural
features,
which
is
it's
a
misrepresentation
about
what
you're
going
to
do
with
securities,
but,
in
fact,
does
not
affect
any
securities
trading.
what
it
affects
is
a
decision
to
do
something
else,
here
to
buy
cds
or
in
my
example
to
go
get
married.
justice
elena
kagan
in
all
of
our
cases,
there's
been
something
to
say
when
somebody
can
ask
the
question:
how
has
this
affected
a
potential
purchaser
or
seller
in
the
market
for
the
relevant
securities?
and
here
there's
nothing
to
say.
justice
elena
kagan
somebody,
not
necessarily
the
victim
of
the
fraud,
but
somebody
has
to
have
had
some
transaction
in
the
market.
it's
the
kind
of
misrepresentation
that
would
affect
someone
in
making
transactions
in
the
covered
market.
how
would
this
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
goldenberg,
suppose
i
think
that
the
correct
test
is
something
along
the
lines
of
what
justice
breyer
just
said,
is
--
is
this
the
kind
of
representation
that
could
affect
somebody?
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
victim
of
the
fraud,
it
can
be
somebody
else,
but
that
could
affect
somebody's
decision
to
buy
or
sell
or
hold
covered
securities.
can
you
satisfy
that
test?
justice
elena
kagan
could
--
could
you
go
back
to
the
madoff
case--
justice
elena
kagan
--because
you
portrayed
it
as
investors
joining
into
funds
that
directly
held
stock,
and
i
thought
that
it
was
more
complicated
than
that.
