ms.
ginger
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
based
on
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
a
bilateral
investment
treaty
in
which
the
state
parties
set
forth
a
standing
offer
to
arbitrate
in
the
treaty
itself.
because
it's
the
treaty
that
determines
whether
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement
in
this
case,
principles
of
treaty
interpretation
have
to
be
used
to
assess
whether
there
is
an
agreement.
so
therefore,
applying
the
domestic
law
presumptions
that
are
set
forth
in
howsam
to
this
type
of
investor-state
arbitration
we
think
would
not
be
appropriate.
howsam
shouldn't
apply
by
its
terms
because
the
question
here
is
a
question
of
treaty
interpretation,
not
a
question
of
the
likely
expectations
of
parties
to
a
domestic
commercial
contract.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
there
is
no
agreement
unless
the
investor
submits
the
claim
to
arbitration
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
treaty,
the
conditions
on
the
state's
consent.
so,
for
instance,
in
the
united
states
investment
treaties
and
free
trade
agreements
such
as
nafta
the
united
states
says
that
an
investor
may
submit
a
claim
to
arbitration
only
if
it
first
satisfies
certainly
procedural
conditions.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
the
reason
that
applying
howsam
and
its
presumption
that
certain
procedural-type
requirements
like
notice
requirements
would
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator,
the
reason
that
would
risk
subjecting
a
state
to
suit
without
its
consent
is
that
in
investment
treaties,
what
the
states
do
is
they
say
we
will
be
subject
to
arbitration
under
certain
circumstances.
but
they
also
place
limitations
on
their
consent
to
that
adjudication
in
order
to
satisfy
important
sovereign--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
they
decided
them
because
the
state
sets
forth
in
the
treaty
itself
that
these
are
limitations
on
their
consent.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
because,
for
instance,
what
the
united
states
has
done
in
negotiating
its
treaties
and
free
trade
agreements
for
decades,
in
every
one
of
these
agreements
is
it
has
said:
we
need
to
limit
the
circumstances
in
which
we.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
we
cited
in
our
brief
the
korea
and--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--and
nafta.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
to
give
you
an
example
of
a
condition
that
we've
actually
used,
nafta
requires
as
a
condition
on
the
united
states'
consent
to
arbitrate
that
the
investors,
when
they
submit
the
claim
to
arbitration,
they
waive
their
right
to
pursue
other
remedies,
and
that
satisfies
a
very
important
sovereign
interests
that
we
have
and
not
being
subject
to
parallel
proceedings--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
what
we
are
--
what
we
are
saying
is
that
when
a
position
goes
to
consent
whether
it
is
fulfilled
or
not
goes
to
whether--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--that's
a
question
of
treaty
interpretation
and
this
court
has
said
that
you
look
to
first
the
text,
but
you
also--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
the
united
states
doesn't
feel
that
it
is
appropriate
for
it
to
express
a
definitive
view
on
that
question
now
because
the
parties
have
not
argued
this
really
as
a
question--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--yes.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
what
you
look
to,
just
looking
at
the
text,
you
can
look
to
whether
the
text
expressly
calls
something
a
condition
on
consent.
so,
for
instance,
in
nafta,
nafta
says
that
there
are
certain
conditions--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
you
would
also
--
you
would
also
look
possibly
for
mandatory
language
in
the
treaty;
so,
for
instance,
if
the
treaty
says
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that's
right,
but
the
problem
with
applying
howsam
is
that
it's
a
presumption
that
is
purely
based
on
the
nature
of
the
requirement,
so
the
fact
that
it
is
a
notice
requirement,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
time
limit,
that
that
means
that
it's
procedural
and,
therefore,
the
arbitrators
would
decide
unless
it
is
clearly
stated--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--no,
i
think
that
is
still
--
that
would
be
grafting
on
a
default
term
onto
the
treaty
that
may
not
reflect
the
treaty
parties'
intent.
i
think
when
states
negotiate
for
these
conditions
on
consent,
what
they
are
looking
to
are--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
one
of
the
things
the
court
could
look
to
is
the
nature
of
the
requirements,
does
it
serve
sovereign
functions,
but
i
think
in
doing
that
analysis
it's
important
to
look
to
what
the
state
says
are
the
functions
that
its
requirements
are
serving.
so
for
instance,
our
notice
requirement
in
our
treaties,
they
serve
the
purpose
of
giving
us
advance
notice
of
particular
claims
and
time
to
correct
problems
that
may
have
been
caused
that
we
can
correct
and,
therefore,
avoid
arbitration
to
begin
with.
so
i
think
you
would
look
to
the
nature
of
the
requirement,
the
text
of
the
treaty,
whether
it's
mandatory
or
whether
it's
expressly
conditional.
you
can
also
look,
obviously,
to
what
this
court
has
called
its
interpretation,
so
that
would
be
the
postratification
understanding.
if
this
were
our
treaty,
we
would
bring
in,
you
know,
the
letter
of
transmittal
that
the
state
department
had
provided
after
it
had
negotiated
the
treaty.
you
know,
there
would
be
a
lot
of
information
like
that
that
a
court
could
look
to.
and
i
think
as
the
court
noted
in
the
sumitomo
case,
you
can
have
similar
language
in
similar
treaties
that
have
different
meaning
because
there
is
different
negotiating
history
or
the
aids
to
interpretation
point
different
ways.
so
our
point
here
is
that
it's
a
matter
of
treaty
interpretation
and
that
you
simply
have
to
look
to
the--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
in
the
treaty
context,
the
state's
parties
are
not
agreeing,
and
they
don't
have
expectations
with
respect
to
the
allocation
of
authority
between
the
court
and
the
arbitrator.
what
they
do
agree
to
are
conditions
on
consent
that
limit
the
terms
on
which
the
state
may
be
subject
to
arbitration.
