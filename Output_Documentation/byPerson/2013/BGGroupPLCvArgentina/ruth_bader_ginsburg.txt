mr.
goldstein,
you
have
given
us
three
parts
for
an
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
position
essentially
that
under
this
bilateral
agreement,
the
case
is
to
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator,
not
by
a
court
in
argentina
or
the
united
states?
so
the
question
is
when
an
arbitrator
will
decide
the
case.
and
so
the
question
of
when
doesn't
say
whether
it's
an
agreement
or
not.
it
just
says,
did
you
sue
too
early,
you
started
too
early?
is
that
your
essential
position,
that
this
bilateral
agreement
says
arbitration
is
the
way
this
dispute
gets
decided,
and
everything
on
the
way
to
that
is
what
you
call
a
preliminary
question,
but
essentially
the
parties
have
agreed
that
their
disputes
will
be
resolved
by
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
the
same
thing
in
france,
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
popular
place
for
international
arbitration,
that
in
the
first
instance
the
arbitrator
decides,
but
ultimately
the
court
can
review
everything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
know
that?
the
question
is:
is
this
litigation
preliminary,
going
to
the
argentinian
court,
is
the
litigation
preliminary
a
condition
on
the
consent
to
arbitrate
a
dispute?
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question
in
the
view
of
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
say
you've
done
all
that.
and
what
does
the
united
states
--
the
united
states
is
saying:
court,
you
should
look
to
all
these
sources,
and
then
answer
the
question:
is
the
litigation
preliminary
a
condition
on
consent
to
arbitrate
the
dispute?
so
after
looking
at
the
sources
that
the
united
states
is
telling
the
court
it
should
look
to,
what
is
the
answer
of
the
united
states
to
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blackman,
may
i
ask
you
preliminarily,
on
your
view,
what
happens
next.
can
this
party
--
and
suppose
you're
right
--
can
the
bg
group
institute
an
action
in
argentina
and
if
it's
not
resolved
within
18
months
invoke
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
is
resolved,
but
not
to
bg's
liking
then,
thereto,
bg
can
invoke
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
doesn't
that
mean
that
treaty
partners
agreed
that
only
an
arbitration
panel
can
conclusively
resolve
this
dispute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
get
your
answer
to
my
question.
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
under
this
treaty,
the
ultimate
decisionmaker
is
the
arbitrator.
there
is
no
provision
for
the
court
to
be
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
the
controversy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
d.c.
circuit
treated
this
as
there
is
no
agreement
until
you
go
to
the
local
court
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
argument
is
that
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
that
will
be
the
method
of
dispute
resolution.
you
have
to
take
certain
steps
before.
so,
you
have
to
go
to
the
local
court.
but
why
isn't
the
dispute
settlement
mechanism
decided
upon
by
the
parties'
arbitration,
and
then
what
you
have
to
do
before
that
is
in
the
nature
of
a
procedural
condition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would
happen
--
what
would
happen
in
this
case
if
there
was
a
judge's
strike,
so
none
of
the
courts
were
operating
in
argentina?
what
would
happen
then?
