mr.
goldstein,
do
you
take
the
position
that
parties
can't,
by
contract
say,
this
particular
precondition
is
--
goes
to
my
--
to
the
parties'
consent
to
arbitrate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
if
the
issue
is
what
did
the
parties
--
as
i
see
it
--
what
did
the
parties
intend
on
this
question,
why
isn't
the
first
options
howsam
divide
the
one
that
we
should
follow
in
this
setting?
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting
that
we
shouldn't
follow
that.
we
should
give
some
sort
of
heightened
deference
to
the
foreign
state,
but
i'm
not
sure
why,
because
the
issue
is
always
about
what
did
the
parties
intend.
and
if
the
issue
is
always
about
that,
don't
we
look
at
the
text?
the
custom
and
practice
of
the
industry?
the
behavior
between
the
parties?
don't
we
look
at
all
of
the
factors
we
normally
look
at
in
deciding
whether
something
goes
to
a
substantive
or
procedural
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
it's
not
that
we
hold
absolutely
that
in
every
situation
a
precondition
is
subject
to
an
arbitral
decision.
we
look
to
those
--
to
the
issue
of
consent,
don't
we?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
maybe
that's
why
the
government
is
saying
we
shouldn't
treat
it
as
a
presumption.
we
should
just
treat
it
as--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
what
do
you
do
with
wintershall?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
that
they--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
distinguish
john
wiley,
which
i
think--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--has
two
components
and
the
second
cuts
against
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
finish
your
answer.
