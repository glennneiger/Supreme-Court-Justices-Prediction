mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
contract
formation
case
and
it's
a
case
that
is
decided
properly
by
the
court
below
whether
you
apply
first
options
or
whether
you
apply
treaty
principles.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
absolutely,
yes.
and
my
friend
conceded
that.
there
is
no
barrier.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
what
the
treaty
partners
agreed
to
here,
justice
ginsburg,
was
a
condition,
a
precondition
on
their
respectively
derogating
from
their
sovereignty.
absent
the
bilateral
investment
treaty,
there
is
no
basis
on
which
an
investor
could
ever
compel
one
of
these
states
to
arbitrate
its
claims,
and
its
only
remedy
would
lie
in
the
courts
of
that
state.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
it
depends
on
the
issue.
the
arbitrator
will
decide
the
merits,
assuming
the
offer
to
arbitrate
has
been
accepted
according
to
its
terms,
which
was
never
done
here.
after
that,
depending
on
the
issue,
there
will
or
will
not
be
judicial
review
of
some
kind,
and
what
this
court
said
as
a
matter
of
u.s.
law
in
first
options
and
what
all
the
other
countries
say,
and
our
brief
really
was
not
disputed
on
that
point,
is
that
issues
of
jurisdiction,
whether
a
contract
was
ever
formed,
whether
there
ever
was
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
ultimately
an
issue
for
a
court
to
independently
de
novo
decide.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
first
of
all,
as
first
option
said,
we
didn't
need
to
do
that.
first
option
was
very
clear
that
it
did
not
require
someone
who
was
resisting
arbitration
and
objecting
to
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction,
because
there
is
no
agreement
to
run
to
court.
which
would
also
be
very
bad
policy.
we
don't
want
people
running
to
court.
we
want
them
to
try
in
--
in
arbitration,
but
subject
to
judicial
review,
if
the
arbitrators
get
it
wrong
on
the
fundamental
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
no.
we
weren't
the
aggrieved
party,
justice
scalia.
we
were
not
seeking
relief.
they're
the
ones
who
were
complaining.
we're
--
we're
the
putative
defendant,
the
respondent.
there'd
be
no
reason
for
us
to
go
to
court.
what
our
offer
to
them
was,
first
of
all,
you
have
to
go
to
our
courts
for
18
months.
and
then
it
says
in
a2,
and
it
refers
specifically
to
“
the
aforementioned
disputes
”,
i.e.,
those
disputes
that
have
been
brought
to
our
courts,
"those
aforementioned
disputes
can
then
be
arbitrated
--
quote
--
under
the
following
circumstances.
"
and
the
first
of
those,
in
a2
--
al
is
waiting
the
18
months.
and
then
quite
importantly,
or
in
a2(b)
the
parties
can
separately
agree
to
arbitrate.
well,
if
they
don't
separately
agree
to
arbitrate,
which
did
not
occur
here,
you
have
to
go
through
a2,
al,
which
is
either
wait
the
18
months
so
the
local
court
can
try
to
deal
with
it
--
i'll
tell
you
why
that's
important
in
a
moment
--
or
the
local
court
does
actually
adjudicate
it
and
then
the
party
who's
unhappy
with
that
does
have
the
right
then,
and
then
only,
to
go
to
arbitrate.
and
that's
the
temporal
sequence
that
the
d.c.
court
talked
about.
it's
set
forth
in
the
structure
of
the
treaty
that
the
chief
justice
talked
about.
you
go
one,
two,
three.
they're
in
order
for
a
reason.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
the
correct
analysis,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
dispute
resolution
mechanism
which
is,
again,
is
an
offer
made
by
two
states
to
each
other
to--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--i
would
actually
not,
your
honor.
howsam
--
let's
talk
about
the
facts
of
howsam.
howsam
was
--
there
was
no
dispute
that
there
was
a
contract
between
the
howsams
and
the
broker/dealer
to
arbitrate
under
the
nasd
rules.
those
nasd
rules
themselves
contained
an
eligibility
requirement
that
the
claim
can't
be
more
than
six
years
old.
and
those
same
rules
also
said
the
arbitrators
get
to
decide
about
the
interpretation
and
application
of
our
rules.
so
it
was
a
classic
situation--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--john
wiley--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--and
the
first
cuts
in
our
favor,
justice
sotomayor.
that's
exactly
right.
my
friend
kept
talking
about
john
wiley
as
involving
only
issues
of
procedural
preconditions.
but
the
first
part
of
john
wiley
where
the
court
says
quite
clearly,
you
have
independent
judicial
review,
has
to
do
with
whether
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
at
all
between
the
parties.
in
that
case,
the
parties
sought
to
be
pulled
into
arbitration
against
its
will
was
a
successor
and
the
issue
which
the
court
independently
decided
was,
is
that
successor
a
party.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
uncitral.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
i
agree
with
you.
the
text
is
key
and
the
text
controls.
however,
i
strongly
disagree,
with
all
respect,
to
your
statements
about
competence-competence
and
what
other
countries
do,
because
we
have
shown
essentially
without
dispute
here,
and
this
in
the
third
restatement
and
it's
in
the
case
law
of
all
these
other
countries
that
competence-competence
or
competence-competence,
or
if
you
say
it
in
german
with
a
k,
all
that
means
is
the
arbitrators
get
the
first
crack--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--it's
not
the
last
word.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
this
is
--
and,
again,
my
friend
conceded
this
--
this
is
an
offer
to
a
unilateral
contract.
how
does
a
unilateral
contract
get
formed?
here
we're
back
at
our
basic
contract
formation
principle.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
i
think
that
i
misheard.
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
i
misheard
him.
i
misheard
him
then,
and
i
apologize,
justice
scalia.
but
this
is,
in
fact,
if
you
apply
ordinary
contract
formation
principles,
as
the
court
says
you
must
do
in
first
options
and
in
granite
rock,
if
you
apply
those
principles,
this
is
classic
offer.
and
the
offer,
we
all
know,
has
to
be
met
by
an
acceptance
on
those
terms,
not
on
other
terms.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
it
is
very
important.
first
of
all
as
a
factual
matter,
this
type
of
requirement
appears
in
about
8
percent
of
bids
and
it
is
most
prevalent
in
uk
bids.
so
this
is
not
some
weird
argentine
thing.
the
uk
thinks
this
is
important.
why?
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
a
lot
of
these
investment
disputes,
in
fact,
the
vast
majority,
involve
challenge
to
some
local
law,
some
local
regulation.
and
you
want
to
have
the
local
court
have
the
first
look
at
construing
it,
just
as
you
would
construe
a
statute
before
you
reach
the
constitutional
question.
the
local
court
can
illuminate
the
dispute,
the
investment
treaty
dispute
by
saying
what
does
our
law
actually
mean?
is
our
law
legal
under
our
constitution?
that's
one
thing.
that's
very
important.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
well,
but
that's
their
choice,
which
they,
in
fact,
made
here
not
to
avail
themselves
of
the
procedure--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--why
should
my
client
be
punished
because
they
don't
diligently
pursue
a
requirement
of
our
offer.
they
say
actually
in
their
brief
in
one
sentence,
we
accepted
the
offer
and
in
the
next
sentence
virtually--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--they
say
we
elected
not
to
follow--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--well,
they
have
--
well,
they've
complied
with
it.
but
more
importantly,
it's
what
could
be
achieved
if
they
wanted
to
achieve
something,
which
is,
as
i
said
before,
constructions
of
local
law
that
would
bear
on
the
investment
dispute.
that's
important.
narrowing
issues,
making
determinations
which
are
not
binding,
but
which
are
nonetheless
perhaps
instructive
and
helpful
to
the
arbitrators.
that's
another
issue.
settlement
is
another
issue.
we
talked
about
waiting.
we
have
eeoc.
you
first
have
to
go
to
the
--
to
the
commission
because
this
sometimes
gets
settled.
if
it
doesn't
get
settled,
as
i
say,
it
can
be
narrowed.
all
kinds
of
things
that
would
be
helpful
to
an
ultimate
arbitration.
and
they
could
win,
by
the
way.
they
could
win.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
i
have
a
number
of
responses
to
that,
justice
kagan.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it
is
just
a
john
wiley
sort
of--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--well,
it's
kind
of
assuming
the
conclusion
if
this
is
just
john
wiley,
that's
a
hard
case
for
us.
but
the
structure
of
the
treaty,
with
all
respect,
demonstrates
it's
not.
and
that
would
be
true
even
if
this
was,
in
fact,
a
contract
between
us
and
bg.
if
we
had
a
contract
with
bg
that
says
you
have
to
sue
us
first,
okay,
and
then
after
18
months,
you
can
arbitrate
with
us,
i
don't
think
we
would
just
assume
that
that
translates
into
you
have
to
arbitrate
with
us.
they're
really
suggesting
here,
justice
kagan,
that
this
elaborate
provision
boils
down
to
argentina
promises
to
arbitrate
all
investment
disputes
with
bg.
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
it's
--
it's
kind
of
all
of
the
above.
it's
the
text,
the
fact
that
it
is,
in
fact,
an
offer
by
a
sovereign
rather
than
an
originally
bilateral
agreement
with
the
private
party.
but
it's
also
--
and
this
is
much
of
what
the
case
hinges
on,
is
this
an
issue
of
contract
formation.
if
it's
an
offer,
it
has
to
be
accepted
on
its
terms.
and
those
are
formation
issues
that
go
into
construing
an
existing
agreement.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
i
--
i
think
you
have
to
kind
of
look
at
the
language.
and
here,
with
all
respect,
it
was
clear
to
the
circuit.
i
think
it's
--
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
consent,
which
remember,
absent
which
there
would
be
no
arbitration,
this
is
a
sovereign,
going
back
to
sovereign
immunity
in
our
earlier
case.
where
consent
is
expressly
put
--
the
word
“
consent
”
is
not
used
--
but
the
clear
language
of
the
text
and
the
implications
to
be
drawn
from
it
clearly
show
that
the
sovereign
is
not
willing
to
arbitrate
absent
the
18-months'
recourse
to
its
courts,
you
should
view
that
as
a
condition
precedent
to
a
unilateral
contract
that
must
be
accepted
by
action.
and
the
action
is
to
bring
this
suit
in
the
local
court
and
wait
18
months.
an
analogy,
which
may
not
be
helpful,
but
i
thought
of
it.
so
i'll
give
it
to
you.
if
i'm
looking
for
someone
to
paint
my
house
and
i
make
an
offer
to
him,
i
say,
i'll
hire
you
to
do
it
if
you
post
the
bond.
that's
an
offer
to
the
unilateral
contract.
he
has
to
post
the
bond.
he
can't
say,
you
know,
i
really
don't
like
the
bond
or
you
want
a
$20,000
bond,
which
isn't
my
offer,
but
i'll
give
you
ten,
now
we
have
a
contract.
but
let's
assume
we
now
make
the
contract
and
i
have
progress
payments
in
the
contract.
now
we
have
a
signed
agreement
between
us
that
says,
i'll
pay
you,
you
know,
$10,000
per
floor.
that's
the
kind
of
condition
precedent
within
the
contract
that
howsam,
perhaps,
addresses.
but
the
first
one
is
the
formation
issue
that
first
options
addresses,
did
the
kaplans
ever
make
the
contract?
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
well,
all
you
have
to
do
is
actually
file.
so
even
if
the
courts
weren't
operating,
which
is
an
extreme
hypothetical,
all
you
need
to
do
is
file
and
wait
the
18
months.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
the
clerk's
office
is
closed,
too?
[laughter]
i
suspect
that
the
--
there
would
be
a
very
strong
case
to
be
made
to
the
arbitrators
that
if
the
claimant,
unlike
here,
did
everything
it
could
to
comply,
and
here
remember,
the
claimant
deliberately,
quote
“
elected
not
to
comply
”,
the
arbitrators
might
well
find
that
the
condition
was
excused
and
a
reviewing--
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
--well,
there
could
be
an
arbitration
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jonathan
i.
blackman
no.
but
in
this
case
what
would
happen
would
be
what
happened
in
first
options
and
often
happens,
one
party
invokes
arbitration
and
the
other
party
says,
i
never
agreed
to
arbitrate
with
you.
it
would
be
very
imprudent
for
the
defendant
in
that
case
to
do
nothing
and
default.
and
you
said
in
first
options
specifically,
you
don't
need
to
do
that.
so
you
present
the
issue
to
the
arbitrators
and
you
would
then
argue
that
there's
no
agreement
and
the
arbitrators
would
say,
well,
there
is
an
agreement
or
a
condition
was
excused.
and
ultimately,
on
judicial
review,
on
your
facts,
undoubtedly
a
court
would
be
likely
to
find,
well,
of
course,
they
did
their
best.
they
tried
to
comply
with
a
condition.
but
that
doesn't
affect,
to
use
my
friend's
terminology,
the
question
presented,
which
is
who
decides
in
the
first
instance
and
then
finally.
