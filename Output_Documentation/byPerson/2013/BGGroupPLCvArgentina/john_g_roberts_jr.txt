we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-138,
bg
group
v.
the
republic
of
argentina.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
true.
there
are
numerous
statutory
regimes
where
congress
has
decided,
for
example,
it's
valuable
to
give
people
a
period
of
time
to
negotiate
or
discuss
before
you
can
go
into
--
into
court.
i
mean,
the
eeoc
and
other
sorts
of
things
saying,
let's
everybody,
you
know,
step
back.
you
have
to
negotiate
for
six
months
or
you
can't
sue
for
another
eight
months.
and
a
lot
of
times
nobody
think
that's
going
to
change
anything,
but
you
can
understand
argentina
or
any
other
country
saying,
look,
before
we're
going
to
arbitrate,
you
know,
try
our
courts,
you
may
find
--
you
may
be
surprised,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
--
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
difficulty
for
you,
the
structure
of
the
treaty.
i
mean,
if
you
just
end
it
after
one,
nobody
would
say,
oh,
they
must
be
contemplating
arbitration
or
arbitration
is
in
the
background.
they
would
say,
look,
you
have
got
a
dispute,
if
you
don't
resolve
it
you
bring
it
in
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nothing
about
arbitration
even
in
the
background.
then
they
say:
if
you
want
to
go
to
arbitration,
you
can.
so
when
you
look
at
just
the
structure,
it
seems
to
suggest
that
article
i,
8(1)
is
not
part
of
the
arbitration
provision.
it
stands
there
and
says,
this
is
what
you
do,
and
then
the
arbitration
kicks
in
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
would
be
better
there
if
this
was
article
viii,
you
know,
arbitration
of
disputes
or,
you
know,
parties
can
arbitrate
but
first
they
must
do
this.
no,
it
just
says
settlement
of
disputes.
the
first
thing
is
you
can
go
to
court
here.
the
second
thing
is
if
you
want
to
arbitrate,
you
do
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
want
to
accept
the
invitation
to
arbitrate
that
is
in
8(2).
if
you
don't,
if
you
go
to
8(1),
which
doesn't
say
anything,
then
presumably
the
decision
of
the
tribunal
will
be
binding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
blackman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
problem
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
--
it's
a
point
on
which
i'm
regularly
confused.
you
just
said
if
we
had
this
provision
in
a
contract
with
--
a
private
contract
that
said
you
must
sue
us,
but
there
you
have
already
a
formed
separate
agreement
to
arbitrate.
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
those,
what
do
you
call
them,
preconditions
or
whatever,
that
that
--
the
argument
that
that's
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
they
may
well
decide
that,
you
know,
you
didn't
comply
so
you
don't
get
to
arbitrate.
but
it
seems
to
me,
typically,
under
first
options
and
howsam
that
is
for
the
arbitrator.
now,
what
makes
it
distinct
in
your
case?
what,
is
it
just
the
order
that
they're
in
or
what?
or
is
it
something
special
about
a
sovereign's
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
all
gets
down
to
the
question,
how
do
we
tell,
you
know,
the
contract
formation
from
the
blue
paper,
right?
i
mean,
if
it
says,
you
know,
we
agree
to
arbitrate
and
we
use
these
rules
and
those
rules
say
you
have
to
have
it
on
blue
paper
and
it's
not
on
blue
paper,
they
say,
oh,
we
didn't
agree
to
have
it
not
on
blue
paper.
how
do
we
distinguish
between
those
two
scenarios?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein,
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
so
sure
you
don't
have
to
do
anything,
you
can
just
submit
the
paper.
it
says
you
have
to
submit
it
to
the
decision
of
the
competent
tribunal.
and
if
the
submission
requires,
okay,
now
you
have
to
file
your
brief,
and
you
say,
i'm
not
going
to,
i'm
not
sure
that
you've
submitted
it
to
a
tribunal
for
its
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
seems
that
you're
not
totally
circular
in
begging
the
question.
i
don't
know
that
a
sovereign
would
be
anxious
to
submit
its
sovereignty
to
three
international
law
experts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
