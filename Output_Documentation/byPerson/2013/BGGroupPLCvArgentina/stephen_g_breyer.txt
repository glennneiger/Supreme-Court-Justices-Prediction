i
don't
--
i
can't
find
--
it
seems
to
me
this
has
sprung,
full
blown,
from
someone's
brain,
but
is
not
well
embedded
in
any
law
that
i
could
yet
find.
that
is
the
--
this
is
not
meant
to
be
rude.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
where
this
idea
of
the
consent
thing
comes
from.
after
all,
it
apparently
comes
from
our
korean
treaty
and
maybe
one
other,
but
i
can't
find
it
in
--
i
can't
find
--
the
question
in
the
case
is,
is
this
particular
agreement,
namely
an
agreement
to
go
to
the
court
first
--
shall
we
count
it
as
that
kind
of
matter
as
to
whether
this
is
arbitrable
that
goes
to
a
judge?
or
rather
is
it
that
kind
of
procedural
howsam,
wiley
type
thing
that
goes
to
an
arbitrator.
now,
we
did
our
best
i
think
to
try
to
explain
how
to
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
in
our
precedent.
now,
you
use
different
words.
you
use
these
words
about
“
consent
”,
which
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
this
treaty,
but
i
think
you
are
trying
to
get
at
the
same
thing.
and
if
you
are
not
trying
to
get
at
the
same
thing,
why?
why
not?
what
are
you
trying
to
get
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
suggest
it
was
the
state
that
said,
look,
they
don't
say
anything
in
the
treaty,
but
it
turns
out,
for
purposes
of
counting
time
limits,
filing
a
brief,
they
count
saturdays,
but
they
don't
count
sundays.
all
right?
and
the
government
says,
quite
sincerely:
if
we
had
known
that
they
were
going
to
do
that,
we
never
would
have
agreed.
i
am
trying
to
get
an
example
of
something
that
is
as
purely
procedural
as
i
can
imagine,
something
no
one
in
his
right
mind
would
think
a
judge,
rather
than
an
arbitrator,
should
decide.
but
under
your
rule,
you're
going
to
say
the
judges
decide
that
and
not
the
arbitrators,
and
that
is
what
is
bothering
me
about
your
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
in
the
treaty
itself,
you
can
have
dozens
of
things,
as
was
true
of
howsam.
we
will
follow
the
unctad,
whatever
that
is,
the
un
or
aaa
rules,
and
you
look
up
aaa
rule
no.
1872(b)
and
it
says
just
what
i
said.
okay?
so
now
it's
in
the
treaty
itself,
and
why
should
that
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
only
found
two,
by
the
way.
one
was
korea
and
i
can't
remember
the
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
any
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
explicitly
say,
these
are
our
conditions
of
consent,
and
you
raise
the
question
to
me,
you
don't
answer
it.
because
suppose
one
of
those
conditions
had
to
do
with
blue
paper
rather
than
white
paper.
suppose
that
they
were
just
what
i
said.
nobody
still
would
think
the
united
states
was
resisting
arbitration
on
such
a
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
here
you
are
putting
yourselves,
i
gather,
that
the
u.n.
rules,
the
aaa
rules,
the
scholars
who
file
our
briefs,
the
doctrine
of
competence-competence,
whatever
that
might
be,
is
in
fact
far
broader
than
what
they
want.
it
submits
virtually
every
question
of
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrator.
and
the
united
states
is
taking
a
position
quite
contrary,
i
guess,
to
most
of
the
world.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
wrong
with
the
house
--
and
i'm
being
a
little
defensive
here
--
but
i
didn't
think
there
was
the
presumption
you
are
talking.
i
thought
it
said
there's
a
presumption
about
that
procedural
rule,
and
i
thought
important
language
was
the
language
that
the
court
has
found
the
phrase,
i.e.,
for
the
judge
applicable
in
the
narrow
circumstance
where
contracting
parties
would
likely
have
expected
a
court
to
have
decided
the
gateway
matter.
now,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
a
little
bit
easier
to
work
with
then
this
notion
of
whether
a
state
gave
consent
or
didn't
give
consent
or
it
doesn't
mention
it
in
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody's
getting
to
the
same
question,
i
think,
but
i
haven't
quite
heard
the
answer.
of
course,
you're
right
in
many
countries.
the
question
of
arbitrability,
that
is
to
say,
is
there
a
contract
is
for
the
court.
in
an
investment
treaty,
i
can
find
a
lot
of
authority
that
says
whether
this
counts
as
an
investment
is
a
matter
for
the
court.
but
the
question
in
front
of
us,
is
this
that
kind
of
decision?
is
it
one
for
the
court?
or
is
it
one
for
the
arbitrator?
and
to
just
summarize
why
it
might
be
for
the
arbitrator,
a,
it's
procedural
but
that's
not
sufficient.
b,
it
refers
to
unc
--
whatever
it
is
--
uncitral?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
it
refers
to
their
rules.
their
rules
provide
all
matters
of
competence
over
the
arbitrator.
the
scholars
have
done
exhaustive
work
saying
most
countries
think
that.
the
doctrine
of
competence-competence
goes
further.
and
you
also
have
the
aaa
rules
which
say
the
same
thing.
so
those
are
all
against
you.
for
you
is
the
position
of
the
--
the
item
in
the
document,
first
and
foremost.
all
right.
i'm
trying
to
summarize
what
i've
got
as
the
arguments
for
and
against.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
make
me
think
there's
even
more
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i
agree
that's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
those
are
not
relevant.
i
mean,
those
are
relevant.
i'm
saying
they
would
farther.
and
i
think
in
what
i've
seen
so
far,
it
gives
on
certain
kinds
of
procedural
gateway
questions,
deference
to
the
arbitrator,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here.
and
now
--
now
i'm
back
to
the
same
question.
what
is
your
evidence
from
this
contract
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
gateway
question
that
is
for
the
arbitrator?
