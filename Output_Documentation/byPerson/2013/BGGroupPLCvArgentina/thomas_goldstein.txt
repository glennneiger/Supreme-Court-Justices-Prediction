mr.
thomas
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
you
to
resolve
this
case
narrowly
by
reaffirming
that
an
arbitrator
rather
than
a
court
presumptively
resolves
a
dispute
over
a
precondition
to
arbitration.
that
holding
would
decide
the
question
presented
and
would
resolve
the
circuit
conflict
in
government
99
percent
of
the
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
argentina
wants
you
to
decide
a
different
issue.
its
position
in
this
court
is
that
there
is
no
arbitration
agreement
with
my
client
in
the
first
place,
so
it
says
a
precondition
to
that
non-existent
agreement
is
irrelevant.
now--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--we
do
not
take
that
position.
if
a
party
were
to
say
that,
as
the
governments
in
nafta
have
done,
as
the
solicitor
point
--
solicitor
general
points
out
is
the
language
of
the
u.s.
south
korea
bilateral
investment
treaty,
unlike
this
one,
we
think
it
would
be
settled
that
a
court
would
resolve
the
dispute.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
yes.
so
let
me
see
if
i--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--well,
a
couple
of
things
about
that.
you
do
--
you
have
held
in
howsam
that
if
there
is
a
precondition
to
arbitration,
it
is
presumptively
decided
by
the
arbitrators
rather
than
the
courts,
so
that--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--all
right.
maybe
i
can
help
by
locating
the
parties'
different
arguments
in
this
case
because
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
we
have
said,
of
course,
that
we
think
you
should
decide
the
question
presented.
argentina
wants
you
to
go
beyond
the
question
presented,
we
can
talk
about
whether
that's
appropriate.
if
you
did
decide
the
question
of
consent,
i
think
you
would
do
it
in
a
three-part
opinion
and
some
of
the
parts
are
contested
and
some
aren't.
this
is
how
i
would
write
the
opinion.
part
one
would
say
look
at
our
decision
in
howsam
and
it's
undisputed
here
that
if
this
was
an
ordinary
contract
case,
just
between
two
american
companies,
then
bg
group
would
win
because
this
looks
just
like
a
procedural
precondition.
it's
like
the
john
wiley
staged
grievance
procedure,
and
i
don't
think
the
other
side
argues
against
that.
then
the
other
side
has
given
you
two
different
arguments
for
why
you
wouldn't
apply
howsam
and
why
you
might
have
a
different
analytical
framework.
the
first
argument,
we
could
call
it
part
2
of
the
opinion,
is
the
argument
of
the
united
states.
and
what
the
united
states
says
is
look,
the
difference
between
this
and
howsam
is
it's
an
international
case.
and
what's
different
in
international
cases
is
that
when
you
dealt
with
howsam,
you
dealt
with
a
set
of
expectations
between
parties
agreeing
to
arbitrate
that
may
not
apply
in
the
international
context
and
so
maybe
it's
different.
now,
this
--
and
the
reason
they
say
that
it's
different
is
that
an
international
case,
when
it's
cited
in
the
united
states,
is
governed
by
the
new
york
convention.
and
in
a
new
york
convention
case,
whether
it's
a
commercial
case,
whether
it's
an
international
treaty
arbitration
case,
what
the
rule
of
judicial
review
is,
and
that's
what
we're
looking
at
here,
do
the
arbitrators
finally
decide
the
question
or
does
a
court
on
judicial
review
decide
it?
in
a
new
york
convention
case,
you
look
to
the
law
of
the
citeus.
here,
the
united
states,
the
federal
arbitration
act.
so
i
take
the
solicitor
general's
position
to
be
this:
look,
when
you
have
argentina
arbitrating
against
a
company
from
the
united
kingdom,
then
the
argentine
company
and
--
excuse
me
--
argentina
and
the
uk
company
don't
have
any
ex-ante
understanding
about
whether
the
dispute
will
be
finally
resolved
by
a
court
or
instead
the
arbitrators
because
who
knows
where
the
arbitration
would
occur.
here
it
occurred
in
the
united
states.
our
answer
is
that
this
objection
answers
itself.
it's
true
that
they
don't
have
a
specific
judicial
system,
that
it
will
be
ahead
of
time
when
they
sign
the
treaty.
argentina
signs
a
treaty
with
the
united
kingdom.
they
don't
know
whether
a
dispute
over
this
precondition
will
be
resolved
de
novo
or
instead,
it
will
be
resolved
deferentially
because
they
don't
know
where
the
arbitration
will
occur,
but
they
do
know
that
the
applicable
law
will
be
the
citeus
of
the
arbitration.
and
there
is
precedent
on
this.
the
government's
argument
here
is
about
international
arbitration
governed
by
the
new
york
convention.
there
are
149
signatories
to
the
new
york
convention.
there
have
been
thousands
of
challenges
to
arbitral
awards
under
the
new
york
convention.
and
we
are
unaware
of
any
precedent
from
any
country
ever
that
says
we
are
going
to
not
apply
our
domestic
system
set
of
rules,
here
the
howsam
first
options
lines,
because
this
is
an
international
case.
we
know
that--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--correct.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
that's
correct.
and
that
is
what
has
been
true
in
every
new
york
convention
case
ever
decided
in
the
united
states
and
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
every
case
decided
by
every
new
york
convention
signatory
because
they
have
--
they
are
accepting
a
body
of
rules.
when
you
were
trying
to
confirm
or
overturn
the
award,
they
agreed
to
put
it
here.
that's
how
it--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--no,
that's
part
3
of
the
opinion.
i
just
haven't
gotten
there.
here's
the
reason
why,
and
that
is,
the
government's
argument
about
the
new
york
convention
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
investment
treaties.
it's
about
the
new
york
convention.
and
so
it
applies
a
company
from
japan,
chooses
a
company
from
ecuador,
and
they
arbitrate
in
the
united
states.
so
the
government's
position
has
very
wide-ranging
consequences
for
any
international
arbitration
in
the
united
states.
now,
argentina
does
make
the
argument
that
you've
described,
and
this
is
the
next
part
of
the
opinion.
if
we
got
past
the
government's
position,
which
i
don't
think
has
any
precedent
for
having
a
special
international
rule,
we
come
to
argentina's
argument.
and
argentina
says
this:
look,
the
reason
this
isn't
howsam
is
that
this
is
a
unilateral
contract,
effectively,
and
that
is,
we
put
our
treaty
out
there
and
now
bg
group
has
to
do
something
in
order
to
create
an
arbitration
agreement
in
the
first
place.
because
we
don't
have
an
arbitration
agreement
with
them,
we
have
a
consented
arbitration,
then
because
of
that,
call
it
a
precondition,
call
it
whatever
you
want,
because
an
arbitration
agreement
hasn't
formed,
the
arbitrators
have
no
power
to
decide
anything
and,
therefore,
you
can't
defer
to
their
judgment.
we
would
never
expect
them
to
have
the
power
to
decide
anything
argentina
says
because
there's
no
arbitration
agreement
at
all.
so
that's
the
next
part
of
the
opinion,
and
it
will
get
to
the
points
you
raised,
justice
alito.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
it
is
not.
there
is
a
principle
of
latches,
but
there
is
an
equivalent
principle
of
equitable
tolling.
so
it's
true
that
we
could
go
there.
i
do
think
ultimately,
it's
a
point
in
our
favor
because
it
shows
how
pointless
this
exercise
is.
we'll
recall,
of
course,
that
while
we
could
leave
--
we
could
file
a
claim
in
the
argentine
courts,
the
argentine
courts,
of
course,
would
have
the
power
to
do
nothing
at
all.
they
couldn't
bind
us.
they
couldn't
bind
argentina.
they
wouldn't
have
to
decide
the
case
in
the
first
place
and
then
we
would
be
back
here.
and
the
question
is,
if
you
have
a
provision
like
that,
which
is
effectively
go
wait
in
the
argentine
courts,
does
anybody
seriously
think
that
that
determines
your
consent
to
arbitrate,
when
it
is
that
that
act,
going
and
sitting,
can't
have
any
effect
on
the
case
whatsoever.
do
we
really--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--we
would
be.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
my
point
isn't
that
it's
not
important.
i'll
give
them
that
it's
important;
they
negotiated
for
it.
my
point
is
that
whether
it's
important
or
not
doesn't
tell
you
if
it's
a
procedural
step
or
a
substantive
step
in
terms
of
their
agreeing
to
arbitrate
with
us.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
the
way
you
would
resolve
that
issue
i
believe
is
to
get
to
argentina's
argument
that
it
did
not
consent
to
arbitration,
that
there
is
no
arbitration
agreement
in
the
first
place,
you
would
have
to
go
outside
the
question
presented
to
begin
with.
remember,
the
question
presented
that
you
granted
certiorari
on
to
resolve
a
very
distinct
circuit
conflict
at
the
urging
of
the
arbitration
community
was:
what
do
we
do
if
we
have
an
arbitration
agreement
and
this
is
a
precondition
to
arbitration?
if
you
were
going
to
decide
the
antecedent
question,
the
question
before
that,
is
there
an
arbitration
agreement
at
all,
which
is
my
part
three,
it
is
the
argument
that
argentina
is
raising
in
this
court,
then
i
think
you
have
to
carry
it
all
the
way
through.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
i
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy,
that
if
you
were
asking
me
did
the
d.c.
circuit
correctly
interpret
the
treaty
and
decide,
i
misunderstood
you.
you
have
asked
me,
look,
i
see
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision,
which
is
three
sentences
long
on
the
question
of
whether
they
can
invoke
this
waiting
period,
and
i
see
the
arbitrators,
they're
the
experts.
it's
much
more
substantial.
if
you
accept
the
united
states'
argument
to
remand
this
case,
which
neither
of
the
parties
think
you
should,
then
it
could
be
--
you
could
suggest
to
the
d.c.
circuit
it
could
reopen
it.
but
otherwise
i'm
going
to
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy.
i
am
a
believer
that
you
should
stick
with
the
question
presented
and
the
arguments
that
are
properly
presented
to
you.
let
me
try,
then,
to
deal
with
your
point
ab
out
the
united
kingdom
court
and
the
point
about
how
courts
decide
if
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement.
we
actually
agreed
that
you
--
you
are
obviously
a
court
--
you
need
to
decide
if
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement
here.
you
do
decide
that
de
novo.
the
point
that
i
want
to
get
to
in
the
part
three
of
an
opinion
that
i
am
imagining
is
that
there
clearly
is
an
arbitration
agreement
here,
and
i
am
going
to
come
to
that
in
one
second.
i
will
just
bracket
the
point
about
the
united
kingdom.
remember
that,
as
i
said
with
the
new
york
convention,
the
united
kingdom
has
one
system
for
reviewing
arbitral
awards,
switzerland
has
another,
we
have
another
one.
what
you
need
to
look
to
i
think
is
your
own
body
of
law
because
each
one
of
those
systems
is
because
of
not
some
great
principle--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
yes.
and
can
i
maybe
take
you
to
the
treaty
itself
and
explain
what
i
think
are
the
questions
for
courts
and
what
i
think
are
the
questions
for
the
arbitrators,
because
i
actually
think
it's
pretty
clear
from
the
treaty.
it's
in
our
blue
brief
in
the
appendix.
justice
ginsburg,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
and
i
will
explain
how
that
plays
out
under
the
treaty.
so
this
is
the
agreement
that
argentina
made
with
the
united
kingdom,
and
the
dispute
resolution
starts
at
page
8a,
it's
article
viii.
now,
there
are
three
conditions
in
this
agreement
on
argentina's
consent
to
arbitrate.
it
does
have
to
agree
and
we
had
to
do
something.
we
had
to
invest.
and
those
three
conditions
are
set
out
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
dispute
resolution
provision.
it
says,
and
i
am
now
on
article
viii,
roman
i:
"disputes
with
regard
to
an
investment.
"
so
this
arbitration
provision
is
only
going
to
apply
to
an
investment,
which
is
a
defined
term
under
the
treaty,
"which
arises
within
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
"
so
it
has
to
be
a
treaty
claim.
"between
an
investor
of
one
contracting
party
and
the
other
contracting
party.
"
so
that
is
it
has
to
be
a
u.k.
investor
suing
an
--
seeking
to
arbitrate
against
an
argentine
company.
and
those
are
--
if
those
things
aren't
true,
there
is
no
arbitration
agreement.
now,
that,
that
language
i
just
read
to
you
is
from
the
local
litigation
provision
and
then
the
treaty
says
the
exact
same
body
of
disputes
are
eligible
substantively
for
arbitration.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
i'll
agree
with
that,
but
i
just
don't
think
you
can
ignore
the
rest
of
it.
so
let
me
explain
why
that's
true.
so
as
i
said,
those
three
conditions
apply
to
the
arbitration
provisions.
so
i'm
at
the
top
of
9a:
“
the
aforementioned
disputes
”
--
those
are
the
ones
that
meet
the
three
conditions
--
"shall
be
submitted
to
international
arbitration.
"
and
then,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
turns
immediately
to
the
relationship
between
the
local
litigation
and
the
arbitration.
it's
common
ground
that
in
the
example
that
you
gave,
if
you
had
just
part
one
--
and
i
just
think
it's
really
important
by
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is,
if
this
provision
said,
go
litigate
in
the
local
courts
come
what
may,
this
would
be
a
completely
different
case.
but
this
provision
is
wildly
different
from
that.
it
says:
go
to
the
local
courts;
whatever
they
do,
it
makes
no
difference.
it
cannot
stop
the
case,
it
can't
change
the
issues
that
will
be
arbitrated,
it
can't
have
any
effect
on
the
arbitrator's
decisions.
it
is
exactly
like
a
waiting
period,
which
exists
in
every
international--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
chief
justice,
but
then
i
would
just
take
you
to
the
next
page,
sub
4.
and
we
understand
what
the
answer
to
that
ambiguity
perhaps
is,
the
last
sentence:
"the
arbitration
decision
shall
be
final
and
binding
on
both
parties.
"
that
is
the
only
body
under
this
treaty
that
can
issue
a
decision
that
decides
the
parties'
dispute.
it's
only
the
arbitrators.
now--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--fair
enough
--
no,
that's
not
quite
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
remember,
imagine
that
we
went
to
the
argentine
courts
and
for
the
first
time
ever
we
won.
so
that
an
argentine
court
told
the
argentine
state:
you
know,
we
actually
think
you
should
pay
this
company
$200
million.
what
would
happen
then
is
that
argentina
can
take
the
question
to
arbitration.
but
nothing
about
the
local
court's
decision
binds
anyone.
there
is
never
a
point
at
which
you
can
say
that
the
investor
will
abide
by
or
be
bound
by
a
decision
of
an
argentine
court
under
this
system.
that's
what's
so
unusual
about
it.
perhaps
i
can
explain
why
it's
there,
because
it
is
odd,
i
will
tell
you,
and
i
will
tell
you
that
in
deciding
this
question
that
argentina
is
adding
to
the
case
in
the
context
of
this
local
litigation
provision,
it
is
a
very
strange
vehicle
to
do
that.
there
are
only
1
percent
of
bilateral
investment
treaties
have
this
provision.
it's
a
historic
remnant.
it's
in
--
of
the
first
15
bilateral
investment
treaties
that
argentina
agreed
to,
it's
in
9
of
them.
in
the
subsequent
40
of
them,
it
doesn't
appear
at
all.
again,
a
good
example
of
how
it
isn't
really
a
condition
on
their
consent.
and
it
is
a
remnant
of
an
era
of
espousal.
it
used
to
be
the
case
that
before
these
treaties
that
an
investor
in
bg's
position
would
have
to
go
to
the
argentine
courts,
and
when
argentina
first
created
the
investment
treaties,
it
kind
of
liked
the
idea
that
you
had
to
spend
some
time
in
the
courts.
but
no
one
would
agree
to
the
treaty
--
this
is
justice
alito's
question
earlier.
no
one
would
ever
agree
to
these
treaties
if
they
didn't
know
that
the
decisionmaker
would
be
the
neutral,
expert
arbitrators,
and
so
it
just
has
this
you-have-to-wait-in-court
feel
to
it.
but
it
is
absolutely
critical
that
we
look
at
the
substance
of
the
provision.
it's
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
like
the
john
wiley
case,
which
is
structured:
one,
you
will
have
step
one
of
our
grievance
process;
step
two,
within
five
days
you
have
to
go
to
our
next
step
of
the
grievance
process;
step
three,
then
you
can
go
on
to
arbitration.
it
could
have
stopped,
theoretically,
at
any
of
those.
if
you
had
given
up
at
step
one
or
two,
you
would
well
have
been
bound
by
it.
but
the
question
you
are
being
asked
here,
if
we
could
just
return
to
if
you
are
trying
to
decide
this
de
novo
or
instead
defer
to
the
arbitrators'
interpretation
of
whether
this
litigation
provision
is
binding,
is
fundamentally
when
argentina
went
into
this
treaty
did
it
think
that
the
arbitrators
were
going
to
resolve
the
disputes?
right?
did
it
expect
--
it's
a
question
of
consent,
justice
sotomayor
--
did
it
expect
that
the
answers
to
these
questions
would
come
from
the
arbitrators
or
instead
the
courts?
and
when
we
are
talking
about
the
process
for
getting
it
going
--
justice
ginsburg
talked
about
the
timing,
do
you
have
to
do
this
for
18
months,
there
is
another
provision
here
about
3
months.
the
natural
understanding
is
that
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement.
argentina
knew
that
it
could
only
get
this
treaty
if
there
was
a
guarantee
to
the
investors
that
they
would
be
able
to
arbitrate,
and
so
expects
the
arbitrators
to
decide
this.
imagine
argentina's
world,
if
you
will.
argentina's
world
is
that
every
timing
question,
whether
something
has
to
be
filed
on
blue
paper
--
i
have
no
idea
what
the
line
they
want
to
draw
is.
every
procedural
step
is
instead
a
condition
on
its
consent
to
arbitrate.
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense
at
all.
there
have
to
be
procedural
prerequisites.
and
argentina
would
recharacterize
this
as,
as
i
said,
a
unilateral
agreement.
so
it's
like
argentina
says
--
posts
a
sign
on
a
pole
and
says
if
you
pay
me
--
if
you
find
my
dog
i
will
give
you
$100.
and
so
you
have
to
perform
an
act.
and
it
says
we
have
to
perform
an
act
here.
we
have
to
go
to
the
local
courts
or
otherwise
there
is
no
agreement
at
all.
well,
a
few
things
about
that.
arbitration
is
not
a
dog,
and
article
8,
if
we
just
go
back
to
page
8a,
does
not
require
us
to
submit
it
to
the
local
courts
at
all.
this
can't
be
a
step
that
we
are
required
to
take
because
we
are
not
required
to
take
it.
if
i
could
just
take
you
to
the
last
two
lines
of
it.
it
shall
be
submitted
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
parties
to
the
dispute.
argentina
was
just
as
entitled
as
us
to
put
this
into
the
local
courts
as
we
were.
it
can't
have
been
an
expectation
that
we
had
to
do
something
before
it
would
consent
to
arbitration.
so
i
do
think
that
this
is
just
on
all
fours
with
john
wiley
for
that,
for
that
reason.
the
only
other
thing
that
has
been
put
on
the
table
in
front
of
you
is
the
question
of
whether
argentina's
sovereignty
should
make
a
difference
here.
and
this
is
kind
of
the
second
theme
of
the
brief
of
the
united
states.
and
i
would
say
about
that
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
which
was
discussed
of
course
in
the
last
argument,
has
an
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
arbitration
awards
that's
controlled
here.
and
if,
when
the
solicitor
general's
representative
speaks,
if
that
person
were
to
talk
about
what
the
treatment
of
these
issues
in
other
countries
is,
we
are
unaware
again
of
any
country
in
the
world
where
the
arbitral
system
of
review
in
the
courts
changes
in
the
slightest
because
one
party
happens
to
be
a
signatory
to
a
treaty,
and
that
makes
a
ton
of
sense.
again,
this
is
fundamentally
a
commercial
relationship.
argentina
knew
that
it
couldn't,
in
the
crisis
that
gave
rise
to
these
investment
treaties,
argentina
couldn't
get
the
money
to
come
into
the
country
if
it
hadn't
agreed
to
arbitration.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
so,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
a
variety
of
cases
out
there
that
deal
with
the
question
in
other
jurisdictions
of
different
ways
of
reviewing
arbitration
awards.
and
those
are
unique
to
their
own
arbitral
system.
we've
cited
decisions
from
--
a
decision
from
france,
for
example,
that
follows
your
howsam
line.
the
important
point
i
would
make
is
that
there
is
--
when
the
other
side
points
to
decisions
in
which
a
court
reviews
de
novo
a
jurisdictional
ruling
of
an
arbitral
tribunal,
none
of
those
decisions
are
unique
in
any
way
to
the
fact
that
it
was
an
international
arbitration
or
an
international
treaty
arbitration.
their
international
rule,
the
u.k.
rule,
the
rule
in
lots
of
other
countries,
is
simply
about
arbitration.
the
reason
that
the
other
side
can
say
that
this
case
might
well
be
reviewed
de
novo
in
the
united
kingdom,
for
example,
is
that
the
jurisdictional
decision
in
essentially
every
arbitration
of
any
kind
in
the
united
kingdom
will
be
reviewed
de
novo.
they
just
have
a
different
approach
to
these
questions.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
that
is
not
the
most
current
view,
justice
ginsburg.
in
a
case
called
nihon
plast,
which
was
the
most
recent
court
of
appeals
decision
in
france
in
2004,
the
court
adopted
the
procedural-substantive
distinction
that
very
much
parallels
justice
breyer's
opinion
in
the
howsam
case.
but
even
if
it
were
the
case,
it's
because
the
french
have
their
own
approach
to
arbitration.
we
have
a
system
that
says,
look,
if
you
can
always
run
off
to
court
because
of
any
of
these
procedural
objections
--
it
has
to
be
on
blue
paper,
you
didn't
write
--
wait
for
the
--
wait
30
days.
another
great
example
would
be
in
lots
of
arbitration
provisions
you
have
to
submit
a
sufficiently
detailed
statement
of
claim
to
the
arbitrators.
well,
that
would
be--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--the
language
in
the
agreement
meant
that
what
argentina
did
disentitled
it
from
being
able
to
rely
on
this
provision.
i
will
take
you
quickly,
if
you
don't
mind,
to
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
so
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about.
there
are
two
of
them.
one
is
the
one
that
the
arbitrators
relied
on,
and
that
is
in
the
arbitration
provision
8-4,
which
is
on
10a,
says:
"the
arbitral
tribunal
shall
decide
the
dispute
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
agreement,
the
laws
of
the
contracting
party
involved
in
the
dispute,
including
conflict
of
laws.
"
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
sentence,
"the
applicable
principles
of
international
law.
"
so
this
exhaustion
requirement
--
it's
not
even
an
exhaustion
requirement
--
the
local
litigation
requirement
is
subject
to
international
law.
and
then
earlier
--
and
so
three
other
tribunals
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
this
one,
that
you,
for
that
reason
of
that
provision,
you
can't
rely
in
the
particular
circumstances
on
the
local
litigation.
and
then
article
iii--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--sorry.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
there
are
three
other
tribunals--
mr.
thomas
goldstein
--that
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
this
one.
and
that
is
argentina
can't
rely
on
the
local
litigation
provision
because
it
effectively
closed
the
courthouse
doors.
it's
own
conduct
disentitled
it.
then
ten
other
tribunals
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
based
on
article
iii,
the
most
favored
nation
provision,
because
this
requirement
doesn't
exist
in
the
argentina-u.
s.
bit.
there
are
only
three
tribunals
--
to
be
clear,
only
three
tribunals
out
of
16
or
17
have
agreed
to
enforce
it.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
have
a
rule
that
distinguishes
the
a4
paper
and
that
rule
should
be,
and
we
think
it
does
follow
from
the
analysis
of
howsam,
which
is
just
a
thinking
about
when
people
make
agreements
and
what
they
expect
is
that
an
arbitration
agreement
is
formed
and
a
party
consents
to
arbitration
when
they
guarantee
that
the
ultimate
decision
can
be
made
by
an
arbitrator
and
not
a
court.
it's
form
selection.
we're
going
to
have
the
ultimate
decision
made
by
the
arbitrator.
and
that
rule
is
applied
in
the
investment
treaty
context
as
follows.
and
it
is,
there
is
consent
to
arbitration
when
the
investor
is
guaranteed
that
their
claim
can
ultimately
be
decided
by
a
court
and
the
state
can't
force
it
to
be
ultimately
--
excuse
me
--
by
an
arbitrator,
and
the
state
can't
force
it
to
ultimately
be
decided
by
a
court.
and
i'll
show
you
where
that
rule,
how
that
line
is
divided
in
this
treaty.
and
that
is,
i
gave
you
the
three
conditions
at
the
beginning.
those
are
not
a4
paper.
you
have
to
be
a
u.k.
investor,
you
have
to
have
a
treaty
claim,
you
have
to
be
suing
another
party
to
the
treaty.
and
if
those
aren't
true,
then
there
is
no
arbitration
agreement
and
argentina
has
every
reason
to
say
i
have
no
idea
why
these
arbitrators
are
here,
this
person's
from
ecuador,
not
from
the
united
kingdom.
but
at
that
point,
once
we
are
a
u.k.
investor
and
we
have
invested
in
argentina,
that's
the
performance
that
is
required,
once
we
did
that,
then
we
are
protected
by
article
8,
the
dispute
resolution
provision.
and
you
look
at
article
8
and
you,
okay,
does
that
guarantee
that
you
have
the
right
to
ultimately
have
it
decided
by
the
arbitrators,
or
can
argentina
actually
insist
that
it
will
be
ultimately
decided
by
a
court.
and
it's
the
former.
we
made
clear,
i
think,
and
nobody
disagrees,
that
they
can't
force
us
to
go
into
court
and
wait
for
that
ruling,
take
that
ruling
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
now
my
friend
says
that,
look,
this
is
like
a
unilateral
agreement,
and
this
is
like
where
i
say
i'll
hire
you
to
paint
my
house
if
you
post
a
bond.
well,
that
is
a
terrible
argument
for
them
because
this
treaty
reads
as
if
he
was
saying,
i'll
let
you
paint
my
house
if
you
post
the
bond
or
i
post
the
bond.
because,
remember,
the
thing
they
want
us
to
perform
on,
supposedly,
is
something
they
can
do,
too.
who
ever
heard
of
unilateral
agreement
that
was
conditioned
on
either
party
doing
something?
mr.
thomas
goldstein
that,
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
i
see.
i
believe
the
answer,
when
this
was
put
to
them,
his
answer
to
your
question
was
i
just
don't
have
to
do
that.
his
view
was,
and
it's
a
perfectly
fine
position
to
take,
and
that
is
he's
not
going
to
help
me
win
my
case.
fine.
but
it
does
describe
whether
this
is
a
condition
of
consent,
that
he
could
do
it
too.
and
if
he
could
do
it
too,
it
can't
be
something
that
he
is
waiting
for
me
to
perform
on
at
all.
i
would
say
that
on
this
question
of
whether
it
has
any
value,
that
all
that
you
got,
justice
alito,
was
that
if
i
were
to
pursue
the
case
in
the
argentine
courts
maybe
something
would
happen,
we
might
learn
a
little
about
argentine
law.
first
thing's
first.
i
don't
have
to
pursue
it.
remember,
his
whole
point
is,
when
asked
if
the
courts
were
closed,
said
i
just
have
to
put
the
piece
of
paper
down.
so
if
this
were
a
treaty
provision
that
actually
involved
litigation,
involved
exhaustion
of
remedies
where
we
might
learn
something
that
might
be
a
different
case.
but
this
is
a
waiting
period
in
an
argentine
court.
and
remember
as
well,
these
are
treaty
claims
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
undisputed
that
the
local
court,
even
if
it
decided
the
treaty
claims,
their
agreement
would
not
bind
the
arbitrators.
and
so
he
says,
well,
hey,
we
might
win.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
then
say
that's
a
possible
argument.
but
let's
figure
out
who
we
would
ordinary
expect
to
figure
that
out.
this
is
a
treaty
provision.
it's
the
experts
involved
in
treaty
interpretation,
are
the
three
neutral
arbitrators,
who
really
do
this
every
day.
it's
what
they
do.
they
have
enormous
expertise
in
interpreting
treaties.
and
so
you
might
say,
and
it
would
be
a
perfectly
valid
interpretation,
well,
maybe
submitting
it
to
the
local
court
requires
some
activity.
but
do
we
really
expect
when
the
u.k.
and
argentina
ended
this
treaty,
that
it
would
actually
be
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
would
be
deciding
that
question,
or
instead,
the
arbitrators.
and
if
you
believe
it's
the
arbitrators
then
we
win,
because
it's
the
kind
of
procedural
question
that
we
put
to
them
purposely.
mr.
thomas
goldstein
and
surely
they
wouldn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that's
the
point
of
the
treaty.
remember
my
friend
said,
look,
if
it
weren't
for
this
treaty
we
could
never
sue
them.
that's
the
reason
there's
the
treaty
because
if
there
wasn't
the
treaty
and
we
couldn't
get
relief
from
them,
we
would
have
never
invested.
and
so
the
whole
point
of
this
treaty
is
to
put
these
disputes
into
arbitration.
there
is
no
special
substantive
rights
in
this
treaty.
they
are
all
customary
international
law.
the
thing
that
matters
in
this
treaty,
the
thing
that
matters
in
all
the
treaties
is
i
don't
have
to
have
my
case
decided
by
an
argentine
court.
