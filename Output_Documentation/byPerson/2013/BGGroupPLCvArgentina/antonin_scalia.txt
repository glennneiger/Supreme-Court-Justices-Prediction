say
that
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
reason
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i
don't
follow
that
line
of
argument.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
treaty
sets
the
framework
for
an
agreement,
but
it
is
ultimately
the
agreement
that
governs.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
no
different
from
the
rules
we
apply
when
there
isn't
a
treaty,
of
course.
i
mean,
if
the
arbitration
agreement
said
that,
that
the
--
you
know,
the
agreement
is
conditioned
on,
of
course.
so
what
else?
what
different
rules
would
you
apply
other
than
the
common
sense
rules
that
we
use
for
arbitration
agreements?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
look
to
mandatory
language
in
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
you
complaining
about
the
other
party
not
initiating
proceedings
in
the
argentine
courts
when
if
you
really
wanted
those
proceedings
to
occur,
you
could
have
initiated
proceedings
in
the
argentine
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i
don't
understand
that.
when
--
when
you're
appealing
to
a
condition
for
the
thing
to
occur
and
you
can
bring
that
about
as
--
as
readily
as
the
other
side,
it's
--
dog
in
the
manger
comes
to
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
he
conceded
it.
he
conceded
that
that
was
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
subtle
difference
between
the
two.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say
that
only
the
complaining
party
can
bring
a
lawsuit.
evidently
they
have
no
declaratory
judgment
procedure
in
argentina.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
ask
them
that.
