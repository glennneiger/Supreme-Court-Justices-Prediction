justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
this
argument
helps
you,
but
it's
your
argument.
but
this
arbitration
took
place
in
the
united
states
because
the
parties
agreed
that's
where
it
would
take
place,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
your
--
your
argument
is
that
by
agreeing
that
the
arbitration
would
take
place
in
the
united
states,
they
bought
into
u.s.
arbitration
law,
no
international
modification?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
see,
i
would
have
thought
that
there
would
--
there'd
be
an
argument
for
saying
that
the
first
options
principle
shouldn't
apply
to
international
--
or
to
a
bilateral
investment
treaty.
the
whole
point
of
these
treaties,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
take
these
disputes
out
of
the
courts
because
of
distrust,
at
least
of
the
courts
of
the
country
against
which
the
claim
is
asserted,
and
--
and
put
it
in
an
international
tribunal
where
some
sort
of
standard
international
principles
would
apply,
but
that's
--
you
don't
like
the
idea.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
just
a
--
a
practical
question
and
maybe
the
answer
to
this
is
obvious.
is
it
too
late
now
for
you
to
begin
litigation
in
argentina?
wait
18
months
and
then
pursue
arbitration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
this
--
what
about
this
principle.
if
something,
if
some
requirement
seems
to
serve
virtually
no
purpose,
it's
unlikely
to
be
a
condition
of
consent;
would
you
accept
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
treaty
that
talks
about
consent
at
all,
so
we
have
to
decide
whether
some
requirement
is
a
consent,
is
on
something
which
consent
is
conditioned,
or
it's
just
a
procedural
requirement
that
would
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
would
you
not
--
would
you
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
if
something
really
is
trivial,
it
doesn't
seem
to
accomplish
much
of
anything.
it's
a
historical
vestige.
it's
unlikely
to
be
a
condition
of
consent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
said
a
few
minutes
ago
you
were
going
to
explain
why
this
litigation
requirement
is
important.
and
that
is
important
to
me
because
i
don't
see
what
it
accomplishes.
i
can
understand
a
waiting
period,
but
this
is
more
than
a
waiting
period.
you
have
a
party
who
doesn't
want
to
litigate
in
the
--
in
the
courts
of
argentina.
it
doesn't
think
it's
going
to
get
a
fair
shake
there.
what
is
the
point
of
requiring
this
--
now,
i
understand,
it's
a
requirement.
but
if
it's
not
very
important,
if
it
isn't
going
to
achieve
anything,
that
seems
to
me
to
weigh
against
the
conclusion
that
it's
a
--
that
it
is
a
condition
of
consent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
just
interrupt
before
--
before
the
time
expires.
but
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
know
what
the
procedure
is
in
argentina.
let's
assume
their
civil
procedure
is
like
ours.
so
you
say
they
have
to
file
a
complaint.
all
right.
they
file
a
one-page
complaint.
they
do
the
minimal
necessary
to
keep
the
case
alive
in
court.
maybe
they
don't
even
do
that,
because
they
don't
care;
they
don't
want
the
thing
to
be
--
to
be
decided.
all
they're
doing
is
running
out
the
18
months.
what
is
achieved
by
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
say
they
avail
themselves
of
the
procedure
in
only
the
most
perfunctory
way
so
as
to
satisfy
the
18-month
requirement.
but
not
for
the
purpose--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you're
really
--
you're
not
answering--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you're
not
answering
my
question.
what
is
--
if
they
do
not
litigate
the
matter
in
--
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
a
decision
on
any
of
these
local
law
issues,
they
just
keep
it
alive
perfunctorily
for
18
months,
what
is
achieved
by
that?
