justice
elena
kagan
i
would
be
more
open
about
that
argument,
ms.
anders,
if
you
had
at
least
suggested
how
we
should
go
about
deciding
that
question?
justice
elena
kagan
because
you
read
this
through
your
brief,
and
i
don't
know
what
a
consent-based
objection
is.
in
fact,
you
say
consent-based
objections
can
look
very,
very
procedural
and
it's
still
consent-based,
or
it
might
not
be
consent-based.
so
all
the
techniques
that
we
use
in
the
howsam-first
options
line
of
cases
seem
to
go
out
the
window
and
not
be
replaced
with
anything
else.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
blackman,
can
i
just
ask
you
to
assume
for
a
second
that
that's
not
so.
if
you
had
--
if
bg
and
the
republic
of
argentina
had
itself
entered
into
this
agreement,
would
you
agree
that
this
is
a
typical
howsam
kind
of
provision?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
blackman,
could
you
sort
of
indulge
an
assumption
for
me?
and
the
assumption
is
that
if
this
provision
were
in
an
agreement
between
two
parties,
we
would
treat
it
as
a
howsam-john
wiley
kind
of
provision;
in
other
words,
we
would
say
that
this
is
just
a
procedural
rule.
that's
the
side
of
the
line
it
falls
on.
so
my
question
to
you
is:
why
should
this
be
any
different?
you're
treating
yourself
as
though
you
never
made
an
agreement.
but,
in
fact,
you
did
make
an
important
agreement.
you
made
an
agreement
with
the
u.k.,
the
entire
point
and
purpose
of
which
was
to
allow
u.k.
citizens
to
bring
certain
kinds
of
disputes
before
an
arbitrator.
so
once
we
have
a
u.k.
citizen
with
the
right
kind
of
dispute,
it
seems
to
me
you're
just
in
the
position
of
any
other
person
who's
agreed
to
this
provision.
and
in
--
in
my
assumption,
if
it's
a
john
wiley
type
provision,
it
should
go
to
an
arbitrator.
justice
elena
kagan
i
know.
but
i
said
just
assume
that
for
me.
and
tell
me
why
you
are
in
a
position
where
some
other
result
should
go
into
effect.
justice
elena
kagan
please.
