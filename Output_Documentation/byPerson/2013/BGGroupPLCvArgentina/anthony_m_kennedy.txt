justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
let
me
just
make
clear
where
we
are.
suppose
we,
or
at
least
i,
were
to
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
that
it
is
for
the
judicial
branch
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement
and
duty
to
arbitrate.
then
i
were
to
further
conclude
that,
given
argentina's
position,
they
have
waived
the
judicial
requirement
and
that
this
arbitration
should
proceed.
i
can't
reach
that
second
question
because
it
wasn't
raised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
just
put
it.
i
think
there
is
--
this
is
a
close
case.
i
think
there
is
substantial
merit,
the
united
kingdom
court
is
correct
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
is
correct
as
to
the
authority
of
the
court
to
decide
the
issue.
i
also
think
that
they
are
probably
wrong
on
the
merits,
but
i
cannot
reach
that
second
question.
it
wasn't
presented.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
i
understand
your
position
that
in
this
case
you
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
federal
--
to
the
argentine
court
by
reason
of
the
language
in
this
agreement
and
not
by
reason
of
anything
that
argentina
did?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
clerk's
office
is
closed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
you
can't
--
no,
you
can't
say
that.
you
can't
say
that.
there
is
no
arbitration
agreement
under
your
--
it
would
still
be
for
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
--
your
whole
argument
gives
me
intellectual
whiplash.
you
have
to
say--
[laughter]
--well,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
go
first
to
the
court,
because
that's
what
the
arbitration
mechanism
provides,
but
there's
no
arbitration
mechanism.
