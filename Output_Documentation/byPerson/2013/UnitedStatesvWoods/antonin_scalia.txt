i
was
just
going
to
ask:
if
the
question
were
determined
of
whether
the
sham
transaction
counts
as
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
basis,
if
that
were
determined
at
the
partner
level
and
not
in
a
partnership
proceeding,
would
it
be
possible
to
have
different
outcomes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
respect
to
different
partners?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
you
have
to
relitigate
the
same
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
would
it
vary
from
partner
to
partner?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
just
say
partnership
items.
yes,
"a
court
in
which
jurisdiction
a
petition
is
filed
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
all
partnership
items.
"
but
then
it
goes
on:
"the
proper
allocation
of
such
items
among
the
partners
and
the
applicability
of
any
penalty,
addition
to
tax,
or
additional
amount
which
relates
to
an
adjustment
to
a
partnership
item.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
can
that
possibly
mean
when
you're
talking
about
the
applicability
of
any
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
penalty
is
going
to
be
applicable
at
the
partner
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
in
addition
to
partnership
item.
you
say:
oh,
you
can't
do
that
because
it
would
add
to
partnership
item.
but
the
statute
does
not
say
“
just
partnership
item
”.
it
says
"partnership
items,
the
proper
allocation
of
such
items,
and
the
applicability
of
any
penalty,
addition
to
tax,
or
additional
amount.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
addition
to
partnership
items.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
it's,
it
seems
to
me,
not
enough
to
say,
well,
if
you
interpret
that
third
part
to
go
beyond
partnership
items,
you're
destroying
the
statute.
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
would
you
not
have
to
do
that
if
you
are
applying
the
third
item,
"the
applicability
of
any
penalty,
addition
to
tax,
or
additional
amount
which
relates
to
adjustment
to
a
partnership?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
that
will
always
require
you
to
go
down
to
the
partner
level.
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
the
government
have
pursued
this
instead
of
saying,
you
know,
it's
a
sham
partnership,
just
--
just
--
couldn't
the
government
simply
have
said
that
the
partnership
overstated
its
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
have
a
second
question
which
i
asked
your
friend
as
well.
is
he
correct
that
if
we
rule
for
you,
each
partner
may
have
a
different
result
because
different
courts
will
find
this
to
be
a
sham
or
not
to
be
a
sham?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
why
--
why
wouldn't
--
couldn't
one
court
say
i
don't
think
it's
a
sham
partnership?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
get
the
question.
if
--
if
what
was--
