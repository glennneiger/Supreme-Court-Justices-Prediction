would
it
be
a
fair
way
to
look
at
this
to
say
that
what
you
do
at
the
partnership
level
is
anything
that
doesn't
require
looking
at
an
individual's
tax
return?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
garre,
it
seems
as
though
you
and
the
government
agree
on
sort
of
the
nature
of
this
problem,
right?
which
is
you
have
a
partnership
item,
which
is
the
sham
determination.
that
leads
to
an
adjustment
in
outside
basis
which,
as
you
just
said,
is
not
a
partnership
item,
is
instead
an
affected
item;
and
that
leads
to
a
penalty,
right?
so
there's
kind
of
three
things,
two
steps
in
the
process.
and
you
say,
well,
that's
not
enough,
essentially
because
the
penalty
has
to
directly
relate
to
a
partnership
item.
and
they
say
it
is
enough
because
it's
okay
if
it
indirectly
relates
to
the
partnership
item.
and
i
guess
the
question
is:
in
some
sense
you're
both
adding
adjectives
to
the
statute.
you
add
directly,
they
add
indirectly.
how
do
we
pick
between
those?
justice
elena
kagan
and
in
that
sense,
mr.
garre,
it
strikes
me
as
wrong
to
say
the
words
in
dispute
are
“
partnership
item
”.
actually,
everybody
agrees
what
"partnership
item:
means,
what
it
includes,
and
what
it
doesn't
include.
"
"it
doesn't
include
outside
basis.
"
"the
government
is
perfectly
happy
to
concede
that.
"
it
seems
as
though
the
words
in
dispute
are
what
does
“
relate
to
”
mean
and
does
“
relate
to
”
have
to
be
“
relate
to
”
in
this
very
direct
way
that
excludes
this
intermediate
step
of
adjusting
outside
basis.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
that
was
the
prototypical
case,
mr.
garre.
there's
no
question
that
that's
the
central
case
that
--
that
congress
had
in
mind.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
only
case.
and
they
wrote
words
that
seem
to
be
applicable
to
this
case
as
well
as
to
the
kind
of
case
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
you're
saying
they
have
text,
and
you
have
a
bunch
of
other
things.
[laughter]
