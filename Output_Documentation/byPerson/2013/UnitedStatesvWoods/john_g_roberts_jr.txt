chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-562,
united
states
v.
woods.
mr.
stewart?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
judge
sentelle
said
in
his
opinion
for
the
d.c.
circuit
is
that
based
--
agreeing
with
everything
you've
said,
that
means
that
the
misstatement
of
basis
might
be
obvious
on
an
individual
partner's
returns.
what's
wrong
with
it
might
be
obvious.
but
it
still
is
made
on
those
returns,
and
therefore
that
doesn't
fall
as
a
partnership
item.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
if
i
could
focus
at
a
somewhat
higher
level
of
abstraction.
i
understand
the
general
underlying
thrust
of
your
friend's
position
to
be
that
overstatement
of
basis
goes
to,
you
know,
miscalculations.
it
was
actually
$20,000,
you
say
it's
$40,000,
and
that's
where
the
penalty
comes
from.
well,
this
case
is
quite
different.
we
are
kind
of
wiping
out
the
whole
transaction
and
then
you're
kind
of
artificially
saying,
well,
if
you
wipe
out
the
whole
thing,
when
you
come
to
basis
it
should
be
this
and
that.
and
--
and
it's
not
sort
of
a
fraud
or
misstatement
with
respect
to
the
basis
itself.
it
follows
from
a
broad
sham
determination
and
that
sham
determination
is
made
at
the
partnership
level,
not
the
partner
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
if
you
were
telling
people
what
happened
here
--
maybe
you
would
--
i
don't
know
that
your
first
statement
would
be:
they
overstated
their
basis.
i
think
you
would
say:
they
engaged
in
a
completely
sham
transaction,
which
had
--
which
had
some
obvious,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
put
it,
some
obvious
consequences.
but
still,
the
--
the
driving
determination
was
that
it
was
a
sham
transaction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
that's
not
true
because
individual
partners
may
respond
differently
to
the
partnership
determination
with
respect
to
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
some
of
them
are
going
to
put
in
something
else,
but
somebody
may
put
in
zero
for
a
number
of
the
reasons
that
the
irs's
counsel
suggested.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
now,
i
suspect
that
those
will
be
only
in
rare
circumstances.
and
i
guess
that's
why
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
even
though
the
result
here
may
be
obvious,
it
nonetheless
depends
on
the
outside
basis
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
think
what
i
understand
your
friend
to
be
saying
is
it's
not
just
that
it's
obvious,
but
it's
ineluctable,
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
outside
partnership
determinations.
so
does
your
case
hinge
on
the
perhaps
unusual
situations
where
you
have
one
of
these
partners
having
a
fit
of
conscience
and
decides
to
put
down
the
real
number
or
has
some
other
adjustment
to
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
perhaps--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let
me
--
let
me
pose
perhaps
a
less
friendly
question.
[laughter]
what
do
you
do
with
your
friend's
hypothetical?
on
the
tax
returns
you
say:
i
gave
a
painting
to
a
charity
worth
a
million
dollars,
in
fact
he
did
not.
and
he
says:
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
going
to
go
in
and
say:
that
wasn't
worth
a
million
dollars;
it
was
worth
nothing.
when
in
fact
what
you
should
be
saying
is:
you
didn't
give
the
painting
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
you
determine
that
the
partnerships
were
shams,
that's
like
saying
that
there
were
no
partnerships.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
you
say,
you
know,
i
didn't
really
give
the
painting,
that
means
that
there
wasn't
any
painting.
it
seems
to
me
they're
pretty
closely
parallel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
the
new
legislation
completely
resolves
this
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
