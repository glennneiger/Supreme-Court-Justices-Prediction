mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
both
jurisdiction
and
the
merits,
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
adopt
an
overly
expansive
interpretation
of
the
code
to
reach
a
result
that
would
upset
the
statutory
scheme
devised
by
congress
and
lead
to
further
problems
down
the
road.
now,
on
jurisdiction,
i
think
the
most
important
thing
for
the
court
to
recognize
is
that
outside
basis,
the
very
thing,
as
you
can
tell
from
my
friend's
arguments
on
the
merits,
that
the
imposition
of
this
penalty
depends
on
is
not
a
partnership
item.
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
add
a
great
deal
more
than
that.
just
to
go
to
the
statutory
text,
with
the
provision
at
6226,
and
it's
on
page
2a
of
the
red
brief,
and
what
that
says
is
that
first
it
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
to
determine
all
partnership
items.
everybody
agrees
that
outside
basis
is
not
a
partnership
item.
and
then
it
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
court
to
determine
penalties
that
relate
to
partnership
items.
and
what
--
and
what
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
essentially
to
read
this
to
say
that
relates
to
partnership
items
or
that
relates
to
non-partnership
affected
items,
like
outside
basis.
and
the
reason
why
the
court
shouldn't
do
that
is,
first,
in
a
scheme
that
divides
the
worlds
into
partnership
items
that
can
be
determined
at
the
partnership
level
and
non-partnership
items
that
must
go
to
the
partner
level,
when
congress
says
“
partnership
item
”,
that's
significant.
it
--
it
adds
defined
terms
of
“
non-partnership
item
”
or
“
affected
item
”.
it
said
“
partnership
item
”.
so
we
think
that
it
necessarily
excluded
non-partnership
affected
items
here
and
that's
the
way
to
read
it.
and
second,
if
you
read
the
“
relates
to
”
as
broadly
as
the
government
says,
then
it
makes
no
sense.
the
partnership
item
here
might
as
well
say
“
affected
item
”
because
you're
right,
at
some
level
of
abstraction,
you
can
always
say
that
the
penalty
relates
to
the
partnership
item.
that's
going
to
be
true
for
lots
of
these.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you're
right,
justice
scalia,
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
let
me
tell
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
scalia,
let
me
answer
it
this
way:
partnerships
can
do
many
things,
just
like
individuals
and
corporations,
and
they
can
engage
in
things
that
subject
--
that
trigger
penalties.
a
partnership
can
misreport
its
income.
a
partnership
can
make
a
valuation
misstatement.
a
partnership
can
engage
in
negligence,
and
the
court
can
determine
those
--
the
applicability
of
those
penalties.
now
it's
true
that
down
the
road
in
--
in
a
mathematical
adjustment,
the
court
is
looking
to
whether
or
not
the
partner
repeated
that
error
on
its
return.
but
what's
fundamentally
different
about
this
case
is
the
penalty
depends
not
on
the
partnership,
just
the
partnership
item;
it
depends
on
this
outside
basis
determination
that
a
court
can't
make.
i
mean,
to
put
it
another
way--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--ultimately,
your
honor,
the
partner--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
the
partners
don't
actually
--
the
partnership
does
not
pay
the
penalty,
but
the
partner
--
the
partnership--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
but
the
partnership--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
mean,
ultimately
i
think
that
would
trickle
down
to
the
partners.
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
two
different
schemes
here.
one
is
where
the
partnership
is
doing
things
that
actually
does
trigger
the
penalty.
take
the
2010
noneconomic
substance
transaction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
yes,
in
the
sense
that
ultimately
what
you're
looking
in
the
proper
proceeding
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
partner
repeated
the
error
that's
on
the
partnership
return.
but
you
can
say
at
the
partnership
level
that
a
penalty
is
--
is
applicable
because
everything
is
complete.
all
the
elements
can
be
determined.
the
partnership
has
misreported
its
income.
in
this
case,
you
just
can't
say
that,
because
outside
basis
isn't
reported
anywhere
at
all
on
the
partnership--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--at
the
partnership
level--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--because
you're
talking
about--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--inside
basis,
not
outside
basis,
correct.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
the
court
in
doing
--
what
the
court
is
doing
in
both
of
those
situations
is
fundamentally
different.
in
one
case,
it's
looking
at
the
partnership
return,
looking
at
how
the
partnership
reported
the
basis
and
determining
that
the
basis
overstatement
penalty
would
apply
because
of
the
error
committed
by
the
partnership.
that
is
everything
that
we
think
the
court
can
do
under
the
statutory
provision
we
just
referred
to,
to
determine
the
applicability
of
that
penalty
because
it
relates
to
a
partnership
item,
the
partnership's
statement
of
its
income
or
basis
on
the
partnership
return.
now,
what's
happening
here
is
the
partner
--
the
penalty
is
applying
to
the
partner's
statement
of
basis.
that
outside
basis
doesn't
appear
anywhere.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
and
the
three--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
the
three
circuit
courts
that
have
addressed
that
have
agreed
with
us.
and
as
justice--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
what
we're
saying
is
outside
basis
is
not
a
partnership
item.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
confusion
maybe
is
between
the
statement
at
issue
here.
the
statement
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
basis
that
the
partners
reported
on
their
individual
returns
as
a
result
of
these
transactions.
if
you
go
to
the
partnership
return
and
go
to
page
169
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
may
be
difficult
to
find
now
because
of
these
fold-outs,
but
you'll
find
what
the
partnership
reported.
and
it
reported
all
of
the
transactions
at
issue
and
it
reported
accurately--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right,
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it
matters
in
the
scope
of
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
and
again--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
words
that
matter
is
“
partnership
item
”.
this
is
a
statutory
scheme
that
--
that
talks
about
non-partnership
items
and
partnership
items.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
partnership
item,
your
honor,
can
include
the
partnership.
we're
not
--
we're
not
disputing
that
part
of
the
sham
determination.
my
point
is
that
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
depends
on
an
additional
determination,
which
is
a
non-partnership
item.
and
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right.
and
the
reason
why
--
and
i
think
that
gets
back
to
partnership
item,
because
if
you
read
“
relates
to
”
in
the
broad
sense
that
the
government
is
asking
you
to
read
it,
then
in
essence
you
are
adding
--
you're
taking
away
the
limitation
of
“
partnership
item
”
and
you
are
adding
words
that
says
“
or
affected
item
”.
because
what
they're
saying
is,
look,
anytime
you
have
a
partnership
item
that
is
in
any
way
related
to
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
down
the
road,
then
you
can
do
it.
but
another
way
of
saying
that,
and
the
way
that
congress
would
have
said
if
it
meant
it
was:
courts,
you
can
determine
the
applicability
of
any
penalty
that
relates
to
a
partnership
item
or
an
affected
item.
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
now--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--our
point
is
the
one
that
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
other
circuits
have
adopted,
which
is
that
to
make
this
determination
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
partnership
item;
you
have
to
determine
a
non-partnership
item,
and
this
grant
of
jurisdiction--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--again--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
when
the
penalty
is
--
is
complete
based
on
what
the
partnership
has
done,
you
can
determine
the
applicability
of
the
penalty.
you
can
say
all
of
the
elements
are
met
because
of
what
the
partnership
did.
and
then
later,
you're
only
looking
to
whether
or
not
the
partners
repeated
that
error.
here,
that's
not
--
that's
not
what's
happening.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
would,
your
honor.
the
noneconomic
substance
penalty
that
congress
passed
to
cover
this
situation
here
solves
all
the
problems.
as
to
jurisdiction,
courts
could
determine
it
at
the
partnership
level
because
looking
to
whether
or
not
the
partnership
is
a
sham
is
a
partnership
item.
and
so
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
and
of
course
that
solves
the
merits
question,
too,
because
congress
actually
addressed
the
situation
here
on
the
merits.
instead
we
have
the
government
trying
to
fit
a
square
peg
into
a
round
hole.
i
mean,
on
jurisdiction,
before
i
go
to
the
merits,
i
just
want
to
talk
about
the
practical
consequences
of
this
ruling.
it's
very
significant
from
the
standpoint
of
the
taxpayers.
what
the
government
wants
to
do
is
funnel
all
these
penalty
determinations
into
a
computational
adjustment
as
opposed
to
the
deficiency
proceeding,
which
is
a
default
rule
under
the
statute,
section
6230.
and
from
the
taxpayers'
perspective,
that
has
huge
consequence.
it
means
that
the
taxpayers
have
to
pay
the
refund
up
front,
as
justice
sotomayor
recognized.
that
means
that,
even
in
disputed
penalties,
they've
got
to
pay
all
that
up
front.
and
then
that
limits
their
ability
to
challenge
it.
it
means
they
can't
go
to
the
tax
court
to
challenge
it.
they
have
to
do
it
in
a
more
expedited
fashion.
the
default
rule
is
deficiency
proceedings.
that
is
where
congress
intended
these
penalty
issues
of
the
type
that
we
have
here
that
pertain
to
non-partnership
items--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
then
i
think
what
you
would
be
doing
is
assuming
a
fact
necessary
to
the
penalty,
that
outside
basis
was
reported
as
zero,
for
purposes
of
finding
jurisdiction,
and
we
don't
think
the
court
could
do
that.
the
government
acknowledges
that
it
--
that
it's
at
least
possible
that
the
taxpayer,
in
a
fit
of
conscience
or
having
fully
--
more
fully
understood
the
transactions,
would
not
inflate
its
basis,
it
would
report
a
zero
basis,
and
yet
nobody
would
know
that
in
a
partnership-level
proceeding
because
the
partners'
outside
basis
isn't
even
before
the
court
--
before
the
irs
or
the
court
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
in
the
individual
return?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you
do,
but
the
partner--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--every--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
every
partner's
outside
basis
is
going
to
vary
in
the
typical
situation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
the
fact
that
it
can
vary,
your
honor,
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
congress
wanted
these
determinations
made
at
the
partner
level.
and
another
thing
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
don't
think
the
court
could
resolve
this
question
looking
only
to
the
sham
partnership
situation
here.
sometimes
transactions
are
shams,
sometimes
partnerships
are
shams,
and
the
jurisdictional
question
or
answer
to
the
question
should
apply
across
the
board.
and
yet
if
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
only
a
transaction
sham,
then
even
the
government
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
basis
could
be
affected
in
many
different
ways
in
that
situation.
and,
again,
getting
back--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
couldn't,
because
--
and
it
didn't,
because
again,
if
you
go
back
to
page
186
--
169
of
the
joint
appendix,
everything
about
these
transactions
is
accurately
reported
on
that
form
which
is
in
the
partnership
return.
the
partnership
actually
reported
a
gain
on
these
transactions.
the
error
comes
in
at
the
partner
level
and
is
only
on
the
partner
return
in
this
situation.
and
that's
why
you
can't
determine
outside
basis
at
the
partnership
level
and
that's
why
you
can't
determine
the
applicability
of
this
penalty
at
the
partnership
level.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
no,
your
honor,
in
this
sense:
if
this
court
resolves
the
merits
question,
then
that
--
that
ruling
whether
the
penalty
applies
or
not
in
this
context
is
going
to
apply
to
all
partners.
so
that
--
that
issue
is
not
going
to
vary
by
partner.
what
can
happen
by
partner
is
different
partners
may
have
different
outside
basis.
even
in
this
situation,
my
friend
acknowledged
you
could
have
a
partner
that
nevertheless
reports
zero
as
his
basis
in
this
situation
and
not
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that
determination,
your
honor,
is
being
made
at
the
partnership
level,
and
we
agree
that
it
can
be
made
at
that
level,
and
that
determination
applies
to
all
the
partners.
there
is
no
inconsistency
about
that.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
--
the
partnership
level
court
can
determine
the
applicability
of
the
--
the
basis
misstatement
penalty
as
the
government
calls
it.
and
--
and
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that
because
it
depends
on
that
outside
basis
to
do
it.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
exactly.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
--
i
think
largely,
yes,
but
if
i
can
explain
that.
first,
it
presents
the
low-hanging
fruit
situation
the
d.c.
circuit
resolved.
and
we
think
they
were
right
to
say
even
if
you
think
it's
low
hanging,
you're
forbidden
to
pick
it.
second,
here
the
whole
partnership
is
shammed,
but
there's
certainly
cases
where
individual
transactions
are
shammed.
and
if
individual
transactions
are
shammed,
then
the
--
the
outside
basis
can
vary
widely
based
on
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
partners.
and
so
there,
in
that
situation,
it's
not
at
all
obvious
or
--
or
necessarily
true
that
the
basis
is
going
to
be
overstated.
you
have
to
look.
and,
again,
that's
why
it's
a
completely
separate
determination
made--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
you
could
have
a
partnership,
your
honor,
that
engages
in
many
transactions.
and
the
irs
would
determine
that
one
of
the
many
transactions
that
it
entered
into
was
a
sham.
that
particular
transaction
was
only
designed
for
tax
purposes.
but
other
transactions
that
it
engaged
in
were
legitimate.
now,
in
this
case,
the
irs
is
saying
that
the
whole
--
everything
the
partnership
did
is
a
sham.
but
in
my
case,
some
transactions
are
okay,
some
are
different.
in
that
case,
the
individual
partners'
outside
basis,
they
may
have
--
they
may
have
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
sham
transaction,
but
yet,
all
the
other
transactions
affect
their
basis
as
well
in
the
partnership.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
because,
your
honor,
again,
the
penalty
is
based
on
what
the
individual
partner
claims
as
his
basis,
and
that
partner
is
going
to
be
looking
to
everything
that
goes
into
his
partnership
interest,
the
costs
or
investment
in
the
partnership,
pertaining
not
only
to
the
one
transaction
that
we
have
hypothesized
has
been
shammed,
but
many
other
transactions
as
well.
so
you
--
you
can't
conclude
either
that
there's
been
any
misstatement
or
that
any
misstatement
triggers
the
valuation
misstatement
penalty
here.
if
i
could
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
merits.
on
the
merits,
our
fundamental
question
is
that
the
valuation
misstatement
penalty
that
congress
devised
in
1981
was
not
intended
at
all
to
apply
to
the
fundamentally
different
situation
here
where
the
government
is
claiming
not
that
you
misstated
the
correct
amount
of
the
value
or
that
you
didn't
have
an
accurate
amount
of
the
value
or
the
number
that
you
put
for
basis
or
value,
but
that
the
thing
that's
the
subject
of
the
valuation
or
the
basis
doesn't
exist
at
all.
i
mean,
we
know
if
you
look
at
the
--
the
pre-enactment
history,
the
post-enactment
history,
we
know
that
this
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
if
you
look
at
the
pre-enactment
history,
it's
all
about
resolving
a
problem
of
a
backlog
of
cases
where
taxpayers
were
misvaluing
property
and
the
tax
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
they
have
basis
and
we
have
context,
punctuation,
pre-enactment
history,
post-enactment
history
and
structure.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
valuation
misstatement
penalty.
the
reference
to
“
or
adjusted
basis
”
comes
in
a
parenthetical,
subordinate
way.
and
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
one
of
my
associates
came
up
with
a
good
example,
i
think.
if
you
had
a
contract
for
a
wedding
that
provided
for
flowers
or
plants
in
parentheses,
you
would
--
you
would
understand
that
to
mean
flowers
or
plants
like
--
like
lilies
or
ferns
that
would
accompany
flowers
in
the
wedding.
you
wouldn't
read
that
to
include
an
oak
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
reception
area.
well,
the
government's
basis
overstatement
penalty
is
the
oak
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
reception
area
here.
the
most
common
situation
in
which
basis
misstatements
are
made,
the
government
acknowledges
throughout
its
brief,
is
where
you
misstate
the
price
or
cost
of
a
good.
and
yet,
they're
moving
--
which
is
--
which
is
why
the
reference
to
adjusted
basis
makes
sense
in
the
statutory
scheme
here.
it
covers
that
situation.
but
--
but
they're
saying,
you
don't
need
to
--
it
goes
far
beyond
that,
not
only
to
the
prosaic
situation
as
they
call
it,
but
to
a
situation
where
you're
not
complaining
about
whether
the
thing
--
what
the
correct
number
is
or
what
the
correct
amount
is.
you're
saying
the
thing
doesn't
exist
at
all.
i
mean,
if
i
donate
a
painting
that
i
say
is
worth
$1
million
to
a
church
and
i
put
that
on
my
return,
but,
in
fact,
it
turns
out
that
i
didn't
donate
the
painting,
i
may
have
committed
a
fraud.
i
may
have
lied
about
contributing
the
painting,
but
i
haven't
made
a
valuation
misstatement,
nor
have
i
misstated
my
basis.
and
i
think
our
--
our
position
is
here
that
if
you
look
at
everything,
as
i
mentioned,
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
context
in
which
a
basis
is
--
appears,
the
structure,
there's
a
graduated
scheme
that
makes
no
sense
with
a
zero
basis
situation,
which
is
essentially
a
nullity.
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
congress
addressed
this
in
2010,
not
by
amending
the
valuation
misstatement
penalty,
but
by
enacting
a
penalty
designed
to
apply
to
this
situation,
the
noneconomic
transaction
situation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
absolutely.
that's
the
way
congress
designed
it.
and
unless--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
the
noneconomic
substance
transaction
penalty
that
was
enacted
in
2010
was
on
the
books,
what
would
happen
is
a
court
could
determine
the
applicability
of
that
penalty,
which
is
based
on
what
the
partnership
did
at
the
partnership
proceeding,
and
we
would
agree
that
penalty
applies.
all
the
problems
are
solved
by
what
congress
did
to
address
this
particular
situation.
the
government
is
trying
to
put
that
square
peg
in
a
round
hole.
and
if
you
add
everything
up,
i
think
what's
--
what's
interesting
about
the
government's
reply
brief
is
it
doesn't
contest
that
--
that
if
there's
any
ambiguity
here,
the
statute
has
to
be
read
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
and
that's
because
of
the
canon
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
tax
penalties
are
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
here,
at
a
bare
minimum,
there
is
ambiguity
as
to
whether
the
congress
that
passed
the
valuation
misstatement
penalty
ever
intended
it
to
apply
to
this
fundamentally
different
situation
where
no
one
disagrees
about
the
numbers
reported
on
the
return.
again,
if
you
go
to
the
partnership
return,
the
transactions
are
accurately
reported.
if
you
go
to
the
outside
bases,
it's
true
that
they
reported
a
loss,
but
that's
because
they
were
following
the
irs'
rules
about
how
you
treat
contingent
liabilities.
so
that
number
is
actually
accurate
under
the
irs'
rules.
that's
why
the
irs
has
to
come
up
with
a
sham
to
get
rid
of
the
property
altogether
and
say
that
we
are
going
to
pretend
that
it
doesn't
exist
at
all.
but,
again,
that's
not
a
valuation
misstatement.
when
the
penalty
talks
about
correct
amounts,
about
accuracy,
about
value,
it's
trying
to
get
at
the
number
that
the
thing
is
worth.
it
is
not
concerned
with
a
situation
in
which
the
irs
is
claiming
that
the
property
doesn't
exist
at
all.
that
--
that
is
a
different
problem.
congress
addressed
it
in
a
direct
way,
in
a
noneconomic
substance
penalty.
so
this
court
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
this
problem
being
unaddressed.
but
what
it
should
do
is
correctly
interpret
the
penalty
that
congress
enacted,
which
was
on
the
books
when
these
events
occurred,
which
is
the
valuation
misstatement
penalty
and
not
the
all-encompassing
basis
overstatement
penalty.
i
think
if
you're
going
to
read
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
read
the
shakow
amicus
brief.
it
talks
about
all
the
additional
situations
which
irs
or
congress
never
applied
this
penalty
to
which
would
be
swept
in
by
the
government's
position
here
today.
thank
you
very
much.
