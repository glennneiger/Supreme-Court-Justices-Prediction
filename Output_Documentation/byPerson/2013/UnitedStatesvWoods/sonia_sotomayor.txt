justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
i
thought
i
understood
that
to
be
your
point
in
your
brief,
but
i
--
there
is
one
thing
missing
from
here.
i
also
thought
you
were
saying
that
you
could
impose
the
penalty
before
the
amount
was
determined
on
the
partnership
level.
that
the
tax
that
you
could,
without
a
notice
of
deficiency,
require
a
payment
upfront.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
the
incongruity
of
your
position
in
my
mind.
you
claim
that
the
decision
of
--
of
whether
or
not
or
what
the
true
value
is
of
the
basis
and
how
much
needs
to
be
paid
can't
be
determined
until
the
partnership
level
--
until
the
partner
level
determination.
yet,
you're
claiming
that
you're
entitled
to
an
amount
of
money
beforehand,
before
that
decision
is
made.
there's
a
tension
in
my
mind
about
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
stewart--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
stewart,
what
--
what
is
this
case
a
fight
about?
and
--
and
--
i'm
sorry.
perhaps
i'll
just
ask
it
on
rebuttal,
so
you
can
save
your
time
for
rebuttal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
let
me
ask
you
something.
there's
no
reason
to
go
into
a
sham
transaction
except
to
misstate
the
outside
basis
in
the
individual
partnership
level.
so
i
--
it's
low-hanging
fruit,
according
to
the
d.c.
court.
but
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
pick
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
obvious,
just
as
it's
obvious
that
if
a
partnership
item
has
a
miscalculation
that
the
partner
is
going
to
include
it
in
their
tax
return
later.
that's
why
we
permit
the
penalty
to
be
imposed
up
front
and
to
pay
the
tax
up
front,
because
you're
making
an
assumption
that
it's
been
included
erroneously
on
the
partner
level.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
give
me
a
concrete
example,
because
i'm
not
quite
sure
about
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused
on
this
example.
presumably,
it's
only
if
they
carried
forward,
which
we're
assuming
they
would
have
done,
carried
forward
the
outside
basis,
the
penalty
would
have
been
determined
just
on
that
one
transaction.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
go
back
just
one
moment
to
the
practical
point
that
your
brother
made?
is
this
issue
only
about
whether
you
collect
the
tax
beforehand
or
after?
because
he
says
that
they
are
bound
in
a
partner-level
proceeding
to
the
finding
that
the
outside
basis
was
--
benefit
was
claimed
in
the
partnership
level
it
was
zero.
