justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what?
that
is,
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
you
agree
that
on
the
partnership
level,
the
irs
could
say
the
following
in
a
hypothetical
i'll
now
give
you:
the
partnership
says
that
this
asset
has
a
basis
of
$10
million.
we
sold
it
for
8.
therefore,
the
partnership
has
a
loss
of
2.
the
irs
says
the
real
value
is
not
$10
million
basis,
it
was
a
$2
million
basis,
and
therefore,
in
fact,
you
don't
have
a
loss
of
2,
you
have
a
gain
of
8.
moreover,
your
understatement
was
more
than
400
percent
or
whatever
the
percent
is,
you
know,
it
was
a
--
it
was
huge.
it
was
an
$8
million,
you
know,
overstatement,
and
therefore,
penalties
of
400
percent
attach.
okay?
you
agree
they
can
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
--
i'm
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
understand
you're
making
this.
but
what
they've
actually
done
there,
since
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
inside/outside,
is
they're
saying:
partners,
to
the
extent
that
you
use
this
on
your
own
return,
remember,
there's
a
400
percent
penalty
attached.
you
agree
they
can
do
that.
now,
what
they've
done
here
is
they've
said:
there
is
no
partnership.
so,
to
the
extent
that
you
use
this
as
your
--
as
a
basis,
as
you
use
this
on
your
individual
return,
remember
there's
a
400
percent
penalty
attached,
because
4
times
zero
or
whatever
it
is.
you
understand
the
mathematics.
so
we
haven't
got
any
reference
to
inside/outside
basis
here.
in
both
cases,
it
seems
to
me
they're
doing
roughly
the
same
thing.
and
so
where
in
the
statute
does
it
say
they
can't
do
it?
they're
saying,
indeed,
a
penalty
attaches
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
use
of
this
partnership
by
you,
the
partner,
to
reduce
your
taxes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
to
the
extent
you
don't
use
it,
of
course,
you
don't
have
to
pay
anything.
but
to
the
extent
you
use
it,
you
have
to
pay
whatever
it
is
plus
the
400
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
the
question
is
--
the
question
is,
do
the
words
“
partnership
item
”
in
the
section
“
scope
of
judicial
review
”
refer
only
to
those
items
that
the
partnership
in
fact
is
concerned
with?
or
do
they
consider
the
partnership
itself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
issue.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
interpreting
the
word
“
partnership
items
”
in
that
statute,
and
you
are
saying
the
partnership
itself
is
not
a
partnership
item.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
but
i'm
--
that's
just
a
question
of
how
they
use
it
on
the
return.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
a
person
could
use
a
partnership
item
on
the
return.
if
this
is
a
partnership
item
--
i
mean,
a
person
might,
for
example,
have
no
tax,
in
which
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
understand
how
someone
could
be
confused,
and
i
am
genuinely
confused.
i
have
read
this
several
times.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
i'm
confused
is
this:
that
i
--
i
understand
your
difference
between
the
outside
basis
and
the
inside
basis.
now
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
figure
out,
via
the
statute,
i
think
like
what
justice
scalia
was
trying
to
do,
i
think,
where
does
that
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
understand
that,
too.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
precise
words
of
the
statute
that
it
would
make
a
difference,
because
in
common
sense
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
much
difference,
but
--
but
maybe
in
this
statutory
language
it
does.
so
i
want
to
know
what
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
you
just
told
me.
i
said
that,
i
thought,
and
you
said,
no,
it
didn't,
those
weren't
the
right
words.
but
if
you
say
those
are
the
right
words,
then
explain
to
me
why
a
partnership
item
cannot
include
a
partnership
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
try
with
me
again.
again,
just
try
once
more.
suppose
that
a
person
owes
a
gift
tax
and
what
he
gave
to
his
children
or
whatever
was
in
part
an
interest
in
a
partnership.
now
go
back
to
my
example,
all
right,
because
i
want
to
get
--
my
example
is
everybody
agrees
that
the
8,
10
million
versus
8
million,
there's
a
penalty
attached.
well,
he
--
he
doesn't
take
that
into
account
when
he
gives
the
gift.
now,
if
he
did
give
the
gift,
it
would
--
he'd
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
the
gift,
on
his
gift
tax
return.
okay?
he
--
they
assess
that
on
the
--
they
would
assess
that,
wouldn't
they,
even
though
it's
a
gift
tax
return,
not
an
--
not
an
income
tax
return.
mr.
garre.
right.
i
mean
ultimately--
--okay.
so
no
matter
what
kind
of
return
you
use,
no
matter
what
the
tax
situation,
if
the
partnership
real
--
real
value
makes
a
difference,
you
have
to
put
it
in,
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
in
individual
gift
tax
return.
maybe
it's
in
a
state
tax
return.
maybe
it's
an
income
tax
return.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
affects
the
taxpayer
differently,
and
i'm
just
saying,
why
does
it
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
the
way
this
affects
the
taxpayer
is
through
what
you
call
his
outside
basis.
why
does
that
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes,
yes.
but
of
course
any
--
in
my
example,
too,
it
will
vary.
of
course
it
will
vary.
some
people
will
use
--
have
no
tax
to
pay,
no
extra
tax,
because
their
--
their
income
tax
that
they
paid
was
zero.
in
fact,
the
government
owed
them
a
refund,
so
it
didn't
matter.
it
varies
in
many
ways.
so
since
it
varies
in
many
ways
and
varies
by
many
returns,
it
might
vary
depending
upon
whether
it
affected
your
outside
basis
or
something
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
not?
“
partnership
items
”
is
defined
to
include
legal
and
factual
determinations
that
underlie
the
determination,
among
other
things,
of
income,
credit,
gain/loss.
okay.
whether
there
is
a
partnership
at
all
does
underlie
the
determination
of
whether
the
partnership
return,
which
had
all
kinds
of
numbers
on
it,
if
it
shows
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
therefore
it's
a
partnership
item.
does
this
penalty
relate
to
a
partnership
item?
i
don't
want
to
say
that
you
are
right
for
the
wrong
reasons,
so
you
better
be
sure
i'm
right.
that
is,
the
--
the
--
does
it
relate
to
a
partnership
item?
i
just
told
you
what
a
partnership
item
was.
it
certainly
seems
to
because
zero
is
what
it
relates
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
end
of
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can't
be
that
simple.
we
have
three
courts
here--
