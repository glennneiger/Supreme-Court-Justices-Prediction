justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
can
you
explain
the
difference
in
the
two
proceedings?
first,
your
position
that
the
proper
review
is
of
the
final
partnership
administrative
adjustment.
how
would
the
penalty
be
adjudicated
in
that
format,
and
if
your
--
if
the
taxpayer
is
right,
that
the
adjudication
must
be
made
at
the
partner
level
proceeding,
what
would
be
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
adjudication?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
using
the
language
of
the
statute
that
you
just
quoted,
can
you
explain
to
us
what
is
the
adjustment
of
the
partnership
item?
that
is,
the
statute
says,
"determine
the
applicability
of
any
penalty
which
relates
to
the
adjustment
of
a
partnership
item.
"
so
what
is
--
what
was
the
partnership
item
adjustment?

mr.

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
--
if
we
go
over
to
the
merits,
if
this
case
came
up
today
and
today
we
have
a
penalty
that
wasn't
there
originally
and
that
is
for
a
non
--
noneconomic
substance
penalty,
would
--
would
the
government
today
be
going
under
that
noneconomic
substance
penalty
or
would
it
be
going
under
the
6626(d)(3),
that
is
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement?
or
is
it
the
government's
option,
it
can
pick
one
or
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
government
could
choose
either
one,
what
would
determine
its
choice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
suppose
the
government
had
asserted
this
penalty
under
sub
(6),
or
the
transaction
lacking
economic
substance.
would
you
be
--
would
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
it's
the
same?
or
would
you
say
that
under
(6)
your
argument
is
not
applicable
to
that
and
the
determination
could
be
made
at
the
partnership
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
just
to
be
clear,
if
this
is
--
6
had
been
on
the
books,
then
you
would
have
no
quarrel
with
the
government
's
position,
they
could
do
this
at
the
partnership
level
and--
