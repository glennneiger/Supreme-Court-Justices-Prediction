justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
your
position
in
this
case
that
outside
basis
in
this
case
is
necessarily
related
to
inside
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
misstating
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
if
we
were
to
write
an
opinion
which
says
--
an
opinion
ruling
in
your
favor,
that
in
this
case
outside
basis
is
necessarily
related
to
inside
basis
in
this
transaction,
you
would
say
that's
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
--
and
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
there
cases
in
which
the
partnership
is
liable
for
a
penalty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
understand
it's
all
passed
through
and
so
forth.
but
suppose
the
partnership
does
something
that's
a
sham,
that's
a
fraud,
and
then
--
and
--
and
files
a
partnership
information
return
with
that
--
with
that
information.
but
then
the
partners
find
out
either
because
of
a
ruling
of
the
court
that
it's
void
or
because
they
have
second
thoughts
that
they're
not
going
to
do
that,
so
they
change
their
individual
--
they
change
their
--
their
own
tax
return.
could
there
be
any
penalty
against
the
partnership
in
that
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
any
penalty
against
the
partners
in
that
instance
that
i
put?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
criminal
liability
for
filing
a
false
information
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
--
then
that
--
that
just
fortifies
the
point
that
justice
scalia
made,
that
the
applicability
of
the
penalty,
it's
--
it's
always
going
to
relate
to
the
partners.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
it
was
a
frame
with
a
blank
canvas.
