mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
merits
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
applies
when
a
taxpayer
overstates
his
basis
in
property
in
connection
with
the
transaction
that
is
later
determined
to
be
a
sham.
the
threshold
jurisdictional
question
is
whether
the
court
in
this
tefra
partnership
level
proceeding
has
authority
to
decide
that
merits
issue.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
jurisdictional
question.
and
before
i
focus
the
court's
attention
on
the
text,
i'd
like
to
make
two
quick
preliminary
observations
about
jurisdiction.
the
first
is
that
the
question
we
say
is
appropriate
for
resolution
in
partnership
level
proceedings
is
not
whether
any
individual
partner
will
actually
be
made
to
pay
the
penalty.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
determination
whether
the
penalty
will
actually
be
imposed
on
individual
partners,
and
if
so,
in
what
amount
is
properly
reserved
for
partner
level
proceedings.
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
court
in
the
partnership
level
proceeding
can
make
the
threshold
determination
whether
the
sort
of
error
that
the
irs
identifies
on
the
partnership
return
can
trigger
a
penalty
down
the
road
if
the
individual
partner
prepares
his
or
her
return
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
partnership
return.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
are
two
separate
questions
here.
the
first
is:
what
can
be
determined
at
the
partnership
level?
and
once
the
partnership
level
proceedings
are
complete,
there
are
subsidiary
partner
level
proceedings.
and
some
partner
level
proceedings
require
a
deficiency
notice,
some
partner
level
proceedings
do
not.
now,
it
is
part
of
our
position
that
once
the
applicability
of
the
penalty
has
been
determined
at
the
partnership
level,
the
penalty
can
then
be
imposed
on
individual
partners
in
partner
level
proceedings
without
a
deficiency
notice.
it
can
still
be
challenged
through
a
refund
proceeding.
but
because
--
there's
never
the
imposition
of
additional
tax
or
penalties
on
the
partnership
itself.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
explain,
as
best
i
can,
the
sequence
of
events
that
we
think
would
unfold
if
this
court
affirmed
our
view
of
the
--
both
held
that
the
courts
below
had
jurisdiction
and
agreed
with
our
view
of
the
way
the
penalty
is
supposed
to
operate.
if
the
court
agreed
with
the
position
that
we
take
in
part
2
of
our
merits
brief,
namely,
that
a
deduction
that
is
claimed
in
connection
with
a
transaction
that
is
later
determined
to
be
a
sham
can
trigger
--
if
they
agree
--
if
you
agree
with
us
on
that
legal
issue,
then
the
irs
would
examine
the
returns
of
the
individual
partners,
and
it
would
verify
that
they
did,
in
fact,
claim
deductions
in
connection
with
this
transaction
because
they
would
have
this
court's
agreement
with
the
proposition
that
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
trigger
the
penalty.
they
would
then
determine
what
the
amount
of
the
overpayment
--
of
the
underpayment
was
and
they
would
presumably
assess
a
40
percent
penalty
on
that.
there
would
be
a
subsidiary
question
because
the
fpaa,
the
final
partnership
administrative
adjustment,
said
the
partnerships
were
shams.
but
it
also
said
that
the
individual
transactions,
the
purchases
and
sales
of
the
options
and
the
currency
and
the
stock,
they
would
be
treated
as
though
they
had
been
engaged
in
--
by
the
individual
partners.
and
so
at
the
partner
level,
there
might
be
further
determinations
about
what
--
what
a
relatively
small
amount
of
tax
the
individual
partners
would
--
would
owe
on
that.
and
then
if
a
partner
--
if
a
penalty
were
assessed
on
the
partner,
the
partner
would
have
to
pay
the
penalty
before
challenging
it
in
through
a
refund
action.
but
--
but
we
might
want
to
ask
on
what
ground
could
the
partner
want
to
challenge
the
penalty
at
that
point.
the
partner
couldn't
at
that
stage
want
to
make
the
argument
that's
being
made
in
this
court,
namely,
that
this
is
just
not
the
sort
of
situation
to
which
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
applies,
because
that
issue
would
have
already
been
resolved
against
the
partner
in
this
proceeding
by
hypothesis,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
the
merits.
and
so
the
partner
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
get
that
threshold
legal
issue
resolved
without
prepaying
the
penalty
first.
now,
if
an
individual
partner
wanted
to
raise
the
good
faith
reasonable
cause
defects
that's
provided
in
26
usc
6664(c),
the
partner
would
have
to
pay
the
penalty
first
before
seeking
a
refund.
but
that's
pretty
clearly
consistent
with
congress's
intent,
because
congress
specified
in
tefra
itself
that
after
the
court
in
the
partnership
level
proceeding
has
determined
the
applicability
of
the
penalty,
the
partner
can
still,
through
refund
proceedings,
contend
that
the
penalty
was
erroneously
imposed.
and
that
language
tells
us
two
things:
it
tells
us
first
that
congress
didn't
see
any
necessary
unfairness
in
requiring
a
partner
to
pay
the
penalty
first
before
raising
certain
sorts
of
challenges.
and
it
also
indicates
that
by
applicability,
congress
must
have
meant
something
different
from
will
the
penalty
ultimately
be
imposed,
because
if
the
partnership
level
determination
that
the
penalty
was
applicable
meant
that
all
the
requirements
for
imposition
were
satisfied,
there'd
be
no
room
for
the
partner
to
argue
down
the
road
that
the
penalty
was
erroneously
assessed
after
all.
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--when
we
say
that
the
applicability
of
the
penalty
should
be
determined
in
the
partnership
level
proceeding,
all
we
mean
is
that
the
court
in
the
partnership
level
proceeding
should
resolve
the
legal
issue
that
is
addressed
in
part
2
of
the
respective
briefs
for
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent.
that
is,
the
court
should
determine
is
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
the
sort
of
penalty
that
can
apply
to
a
basis
overstatement
that
is
produced
through
a
sham
transaction.
we
wouldn't
ask
the
court
in
the
partnership
level
proceeding
to
go
beyond
that
legal
determination
and
to
ask
whether
individual
partners
had
actually
underpaid
their
tax
or
whether
they
had
actually
misstated
basis.
it's
always
theoretically
possible
in
a
case
like
this
that
the
partnership
could
be
determined
--
that
the
partner
could
participate
in
sham
transactions,
but
by
the
time
it
was
--
he
had
to
file
his
own
return,
he
could
get
cold
feet
or
he
could
get
legal
advice
that
indicated
this
just
isn't
going
to
work.
and
so
it's
possible
that
the
partner
could
prepare
his
return
in
a
way
that
was
lawful.
and
the
irs,
after
the
partnership
level
proceedings
were
complete,
would
have
to
look
at
the
partner
return
in
order
to
see
what
that
had
--
what
had
happened.
i
think
the
main
practical
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
absolutely.
and
i
think
that's
the
main
practical
difference
between
the
way
the
system
would
operate
under
our
view
of
tefra
and
the
way
it
would
operate
under
respondent's
view.
that
is,
under--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
under
respondent's
view,
the
irs
was
not
required
to
say
anything
at
all
in
the
fpaa
about
the
potential
imposition
of
basis
overstatement
penalties
down
the
road.
if
the
fpaa
adjustments
--
the
shamming
determination
had
been
upheld
at
the
partnership
level,
under
respondent's
view,
the
irs
could
then
assess
penalties
against
individual
partners.
and
if
the
individual
partners
raised
an
objection,
the
same
arguments
that
are
raised
in
part
2
of
the
respondent's
merits
briefs,
that
would
have
to
be
litigated
potentially
by
different
judges
in
different
partnership
--
in
different
partner
level
proceedings
with
potentially
inconsistent
outcomes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
a
fair
way
to
put
it.
and
another
way
we
would
put
it
is:
any
question
that
will
necessarily
have
the
same
answer
for
all
partners
should
presumptively
be
resolved
at
the
partnership
level.
that
is,
the
legal
issue
that's
briefed
in
part
2
of
the
parties'
respective
merits
brief,
we
may
be
right,
respondent
may
be
right,
but
the
answer
is
going
to
be
the
same
for
all
partners.
either
this
is
the
sort
of
basis
overstatement
that
can
trigger
the
penalty
or
it
isn't.
the
second
practical
difference
that
i
wanted
to
--
to
allude
to,
at
least
briefly,
between
our
position
and
the
respondent's
is
that
6226(f)
is
the
provision
that
deals
with
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
a
partnership
level
proceeding.
6221
is
the
provision
that
tells
the
irs
what
it's
supposed
to
do
at
the
partnership
level,
and
it
also
tells
the
irs
determine
the
applicability
of
any
penalty
that's
related
to
an
adjustment
to
a
partnership
item.
now
--
now,
one
advantage
of
requiring
the
irs
to
make
at
least
this
sort
of
threshold
determination
of
penalties
at
the
outset
is
that
if
the
irs
makes
an
adjustment
to
a
partnership
item,
and
the
irs
believes
that
it
is
the
sort
of
adjustment
that
down
the
road
could
trigger
the
imposition
of
penalties,
that's
the
sort
of
thing
an
individual
partner
would
want
to
know
in
deciding
whether
to
challenge
the
adjustment.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
see--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
see
how.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
argument
you're
referring
to.
but
there
are
--
i
mean,
there
are
provisions
that
deal
with
the
way
the
limitations
periods
runs,
depending
on
when
the
partnership
return
is
filed
and
when
the
partner
returns
are
filed.
but
i
don't
see
how
that
would
happen.
we
--
we
would
still
be
subject
in
assessing
penalties
against
any
individual
partners
to
whatever
limitations
period
the
code
provides
and
either
we
would
or
would
not
have
obtained
a
legal
ruling
on
--
on
the
legal
issue
whether
the
penalties
are
--
are
the
sort
that
could
follow
from
this
partnership
item
adjustment,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
implications
for
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
this
is
on
page
6-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
and
the
adjustment
to
the
partnership
item
is
the
shamming
determination.
the
determination
that
the
partnerships
were
not
engaged
in
for
business
purposes,
that
they
were
engaged
in
purely
as
tax
avoidance
measures.
and
respondent
concedes
that
this
is
a
partnership
item,
because
respondent
concedes
that
the
district
court
had
authority
to
review
the
shamming
determination,
decide
whether
that
determination
was
appropriate.
and
that
concession
necessarily
depends
upon
the
proposition
that
the
determination
of
the
partnerships
are
shams
was
an
adjustment
to
a
partnership
item.
and
it
makes
sense
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
the
determination
whether
these
are
valid
partnerships
necessarily
underlies
any
other
determination
that
the
irs
would
make
about
the
proper
tax
treatment
of
items
reported
on
the
partnership
return.
and
second,
it
is
the
sort
of
determination
that
is
going
to
have
one
answer
for
every
partner,
either
the
partnership
is
a
sham
or
it's
not.
but
it
can't
be
the
case
that
a
particular
partnership
is
a
sham
with
respect
to
some
partners
and
not
others.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
now,
we
would
agree
with
judge
sentelle
that
outside
basis,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
a
partnership
item.
an
outside
basis,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
designated
as
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
in
a
partnership
level
proceeding
can
determine.
but
there
--
and
usually,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
determine
outside
basis
at
that
stage,
because
typically,
outside
basis
will
vary
from
partner
to
partner.
but
there
are
some
instances
in
which
a
court
needs
to
determine
outside
basis--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
in
the
--
in
the
more
typical
case
the
outside
basis
would
depend
upon
the
amount
that
a
particular
partner
had
paid
for
his
own
partnership
interest.
and
so
in
that
situation,
not
every
partner
would
necessarily
have
--
have
paid
the
same
thing.
but
there
are
fairly
rare
situations
in
which
in
order
to
make
some
determination
that
is
specified
in
6226(f),
the
court
and
the
irs
along
the
way
have
to
determine
outside
basis.
and
one
example
we
gave
on
page
32
of
our
brief,
we
have
a
footnote
that
says,
it's
not
implicated
here,
but
outside
basis
is
sometimes
a
component
of
a
partnership
item
such
as
inside
basis.
and
we
cite
a
case
that
was
ultimately
decided
by
this
court,
but
it's
a
case
in
which
a
partnership
took
advantage
of
code
proceedings
that
said
you
can
step
up
your
inside
basis
to
max
the
outside
bases
of
your
partner,
partners.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
--
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
what
we
are
saying
is
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
would
be
triggered
down
the
road,
the
irs
and
the
court
would
have
to
make
certain
--
would
have
to
decide
what
is
the
proper
outside
basis
in
a
sham
partnership.
if
a
lawyer
were
asked
for
--
if
a
lawyer
saw
an
adjustment
that
said
we
regard
these
partnerships
as
shams,
and
the
lawyer
were
asked,
does
that
mean
that
i
could
be
subject
to
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
if
i
reported
deductions
on
purported
losses
from
that
partnership,
the
only
way
the
lawyer
would
answer
that
question
is
to
ask:
well,
what's
true
basis
in
a
sham
partnership?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
i
mean,
i
think
in
this--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
i
think
that's
not
really
the
reason
we're
saying
the
court
needs
to
--
i
pointed
the
court
to
a
different
case
in
which
outside
basis
had
to
be
determined
at
the
partnership
level
for
a
different
reason;
namely,
because
it
was
a
--
in
that
case,
it
was
a
component
of
inside
basis.
and
since
inside
basis
is
a
partnership
item,
you
can
only
determine
that
partnership
item
by
reference
to
outside
basis.
here
we
have
a
somewhat
different
argument.
we're
saying
the
thing
that
had
to
be
determined
at
the
partnership
level
was
the
applicability
of
the
penalties.
and
the
only
way
you
can
decide
whether
a
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
is
applicable
is
to
determine
what
would
be
true
basis
in
a
sham
partnership.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it's
the
government's
option.
and
if
you
--
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
at
page
18a
of
the
appendix
to
--
to
the
respondent's
brief,
because
that
actually
reproduces
the
current
version
of
the
code
that
contains
the
2010
penalty
that
--
that
you're
referring
to.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
in
some
instances,
the
government
will
--
the
government
will
pick
the
one
that
it
thinks
is
easiest
to
prove.
some
of
the
penalties
are
limited
to
20
percent
whereas
some
can
be
bumped
up
to
40
percent,
and
we
would
look
for
the
40
percent
penalty.
but
if
i
could,
on
page
18a,
we're
talking
about
section
6662(b),
and
it
says:
"portion
of
underpayment
to
which
section
applies.
"
and
then
it
says:
"this
section
shall
apply
to
the
portion
of
any
underpayment
which
is
attributable
to
one
or
more
of
the
following.
"
and
then
it
lists
six
items.
subsection
(3)
is
the
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
that
we're
relying
on
here.
subsection
(6)
is
a
disallowance
of
claimed
tax
benefits
by
reason
of
a
transaction
lacking
economic
substance.
that's
the
--
the
2010
penalty.
now,
the
two
points
i
would
make
are:
first,
it's
very
clear
that
many,
many
cases
that
would
fall
under
subsection
(6)
would
also
fall
under
subsection
(1)
or
(2);
that
is,
they
could
involve
negligence
or
disregard
of
rules
or
regulations.
they
could
also
involve
a
substantial
understatement
of
income
tax,
which
basically
means
any
understatement
of
income
tax
that's
10
percent
or
more
of
the
true
tax
owed.
and
so
if
there's
no
incongruity
in
saying
subsection
(6)
should
apply
to
some
cases
where
(1)
and
(2)
would
also
apply,
there
shouldn't
be
any
greater
incongruity
in
saying
it
can
apply
to
some
cases
where
subsection
(3)
would
apply.
the
other
point
i
would
make
pertains
to
the
introductory
language
of
that
provision,
and
it
says:
and
i
think
the
primary
practical
significance
of
the
“
one
or
more
”
language
is
that
it
functions
as
an
anti-stacking
provision.
it
tells
you
it
doesn't
matter
whether
your
underpayment
triggers
only
one
of
these
penalties
or
all
six
of
them;
you're
still
limited
to
20
percent
unless
you
can
get
the
--
the
40
percent
through
some
other
provision.
so
we
can't
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
--
that
more
than
one
penalty
applies
to
a
particular
transaction
by
getting
20
percent
on
top
of
20
percent
on
top
of
20
percent.
but
the
very
fact
that
congress
used
that
language
"which
is
attributable
to
one
or
more
of
the
following.
"
indicates
that
it
anticipated
situations
in
which
particular
underpayments
would
be
attributable
to
more
than
one
of
those
penalties.
it
didn't
see
any
anomaly
in
the
idea
that
a
penalty
that
triggers
subsection
(3)
could
trigger
subsection
(1)
or
(2).
and,
again,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
there's
a
greater
anomaly
with
respect
to
subsection
(6).
the
other
thing
i
would
say
is
that
in
this
case,
(3)
and
--
if
it
arose
in
connection
with
a
transaction
that
occurred
today,
(3)
and
(6)
would
be
coterminous.
either
of
them
would
apply.
but
there
will
be
plenty
of
cases
in
which
a
substantial
valuation
misstatement
penalty
on
our
view
could
be
triggered
by
a
legal
error
in
computing
basis,
such
as
use
of
the
wrong
depreciation
rate.
that
would
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
two
things
that
--
or
at
least
two
things
i
would
say
in
response
to
that
are
that
here
the
whole
point
of
the
avoidance
scheme
was
to
create
an
artificially
inflated
basis.
that
is,
the
high,
high
basis
that's
claimed
on
the
individual
s'
returns
was
not
simply
a
fortuitous
result
of
an
avoidance
scheme
that
operated
through
some
other
means.
the
whole
point
--
if
you
want
to
claim
a
loss
on
a
transaction
where
you
didn't
incur
an
actual
economic
loss,
you
can
do
it
either
by
under
--
by
understating
the
amount
that
you
were
paid
for
the
asset
or
by
overstating
your
basis.
and
this
is
one
of
a
number
of
tax
avoidance
schemes
that
operate
by
overstating
basis.
so,
it's
true
that
the
transaction
was
determined
to
be
a
sham,
but
the
sham
determination
was
intimately
bound
up
with
the
fact
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
scheme
was
to
create
an
inflated
basis.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
the
--
the
other
couple
of
points
i
would
make
are,
there's
nothing
illegal
about
engaging
in
a
transaction
that
lacks
economic
substance.
that
is,
if
the
partners
had
engaged
in
these
offsetting
currency
transactions
but
then
had
decided
before
filing
their
return
that
either
we
--
we
no
longer
believe
that
this
is
right
conduct
or
we
believe
we're
going
to
get
caught,
and
they
had
prepared
their
returns
in
a
lawful
way,
nothing
bad
would
have
happened
to
them.
the
--
the
thing
that
subjects
them
to
potential
penalties
is
the
fact
that
they
claimed
a
large
loss
on
their
tax
returns
and
they
did
that
by
claiming
a
large
false
basis
in
the
--
the
partnership.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is,
you
know,
when
i
took
math
in
junior
high
and
high
school,
the
teacher
would
always
tell
us
to
show
your
work
when
you
handed
in
an
assignment,
don't
just
give
the
answer
at
the
end;
indicate
the
process
by
which
you
arrived
at
that
number.
and
in
essence,
when
the
code
says
impose
penalties
on
underpayments
that
are
attributable
to
the
following
things,
it
says
--
it
means
we're
going
to
look
at
your
work.
when
we
determine
that
you
have
paid
too
little
tax,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
calculation
process
by
which
you
arrived
at
the
amount
on
your
own
return
and
figure
out
where
you
went
wrong.
and
if
they
did
that
here,
they
would
say
the
mistake
these
taxpayers
made,
the
reason
they
didn't
pay
as
much
tax
as
they
owed,
was
not
that
they
claimed
to
have
sold
the
assets
--
it
was
not
that
they
claimed
to
have
sold
the
assets
for
less
than
they
actually
realized;
it
was
that
they
claimed
a
basis
that
had
--
had
no
founding
in
reality.
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say
in
--
in
connection
with
that
is
it's
no
accident
that
this
scheme
operated
through
the
creation
of
sham
partnerships.
that
is,
if
the
taxpayers
themselves
had
bought
the
offsetting
long
and
short
currency
options,
there
would
have
been
no
colorable
argument
that
they
could
have
claimed
the
costs--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kagan,
i
agree
with
your
point
that
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
the
crucial
contested
language
is
“
relates
to
”
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
basis
overstatement
penalty
here
relates
to
the
sham--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
this
is
a
different
situation
because
the
irs
did
not
determine
that
the
underlying
transactions,
the
purchases
and
sale
of
currency
options
and
so
forth,
didn't
occur.
it
determined
that
the
partnerships
were
shams.
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
important
point.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
were
no
partnerships--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
what
the
fpaa
also
said
was,
because
there
were
no
partnerships,
the
transactions
should
be
treated
as
though
they
had
--
were
engaged
in
by
the
individual
partners.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well
--
and
i
--
and
i
think,
as
--
as
i
was
starting
to
say
at
the
close
of
my
opening
argument,
it's
no
accident
that
the
partnerships
were
used
to
effectuate
this
scheme,
because
if
the
individuals
had
bought
and
sold
the
offsetting
foreign
currency
options,
they
would
have
had
no
colorable
rationale
for
contending
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
the
cost
of
the
long
option
but
they
were
not
required
to
treat
as
income
the
amount
they
received
from
the
short
option.
it
would
have
been
absolutely
clear
that
the
transaction,
taken
as
a
whole,
was
a
wash.
the
only
way
that
they
could
try
to
create
the
appearance
of
a
paper
loss
was
by
manipulating
the
rules
that
govern
the
computation
of
basis
in
partnerships.
and
so
the
shamming
determination,
in
effect,
was
a
determination
that,
for
tax
purposes,
you
can't
try
to
take
advantage
of
the
helmer
rule
that
says
that,
for
computing
basis
in
a
partnership,
we
will
ignore
the
--
the
contingent
liability
created
by
the
short
option.
the
--
the
one
thing
--
other
thing
i
would
say
on
the
merits
as
to
why
we
care
about
this
case
is
that
respondent's
argument
doesn't
just
go
to
--
on
--
on
subsection
3,
doesn't
just
go
to
basis
overstatements
that
are
produced
through
sham
transactions.
it
goes
to
all
basis
overstatements
that
are
produced
through
legal
errors.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
completely
resolves
the
specific
problem
posed
by
this
--
almost
completely
resolves
the
specific
problem.
subsection
6
undoubtedly
would
cover
this
case.
now
subsection
6,
the
trigger
for
having
a
40
percent
penalty
rather
than
a
20
percent
penalty
is
slightly
different.
under
subsection
6
you
are
--
if
you
disclose
the
relevant
information
on
your
tax
return,
then
even
if
it's
later
determined
that
the
transaction
lacked
economic
substance,
you
would
be
subject
only
to
the
20
percent
penalty.
under
subsection
3
you
can
get
the
40
percent
if
the
overstatement
is
400
percent
or
more
regardless
of
disclosure.
but
it
almost
completely
covers
it.
but
other
--
other--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
the
question
simply
goes
to
the
allocation
of
responsibilities
between
the
partnership-level
court
and
the
partner-level
court.
now,
when
he
says
we
are
trying
to
avoid
deficiency
proceedings,
i
--
i
think
it
ignores
the
fact
that,
under
our
reading,
the
important
legal
objections
that
respondent
has
made
to
the
penalty,
and
then
he
made
the
arguments
that
are
set
forth
in
part
2
of
their
brief,
can
resolve
--
under
our
theory,
can
be
resolved
at
the
partnership
level
without
prepayment
of
penalties.
