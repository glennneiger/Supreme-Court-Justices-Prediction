chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-1281,
the
national
labor
relations
board
v.
noel
canning.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
--
you
say
that
it
would
repudiate
the
constitutionality
of
appointments.
you
don't
suggest
that
those
--
the
actions
of
those
appointees
would
be
invalid
going
back
however
far
you
want
to
go
back,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
just
talk
--
let's
focus
on
that.
what
if,
instead
of
saying
“
no
business
shall
be
conducted
”,
the
order
said,
"it
is
not
anticipated
that
any
business
will
be
conducted.
"
does
that
suffice
to
eliminate
that
period
as
a
recess?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
well,
it's
difficult
and
harder,
but
it
also
suggests
that
you're
just
talking
about
a
couple
of
magic
words
that
the
senate
can
just
change
at
the
drop
of
a
hat.
so
maybe
the
point
is
not
that
significant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
compromise
they
settled
on
in
moving
away
from
that
is
that
the
president
will
nominate
and
the
senate,
if
it
so
chooses,
can
confirm
a
nominee.
you
spoke
of
the
intransigence
of
the
senate.
well,
they
have
an
absolute
right
not
to
confirm
nominees
that
the
president
submits.
and
it
seems
to
me,
following
up
on
justice
kagan's
point,
you're
latching
on
to
the
recess
appointment
clause
as
a
way
to
combat
that
intransigence
rather
than
to
deal
with
the
happenstance
that
the
senate
is
not
in
session
when
a
vacancy
becomes
open.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
senate
has
--
the
congress
and
the
executive
have
come
together
to
address
those
sorts
of
problems
in
a
vast
number
of
cases
by
providing
that
there
can
be
an
acting
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb
to
deal
with
that
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
it's
your
argument
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
one
flaw
with
your
argument
is
that
it
makes
the
words
“
it
may
happen
”
or
“
happen
during
”
superfluous,
that
the
clause
would
mean
exactly
what
you
say
it
means
if
you
took
those
words
out.
and
your
response,
the
only
one
i
could
see
on
the
reply
--
your
reply
brief,
page
13,
is
that
those
words
were
put
in
there
to
quote,
"confine
the
president
to
filling
vacancies
that
actually
exist
at
the
time
of
appointment.
"
now,
is
that
--
did
you
really
think
that
they
put
that
language
in
there
because
they
were
afraid
the
president
would
fill
appointments
that
don't
exist?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
francisco?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
before
you
do
so,
i
mean,
is
the
senate's
power,
in
your
view,
so
comprehensive
that
if
they
passed
an
order
saying,
we're
actually
never
in
recess,
people
can
be
reached,
you
know,
we
can
call
people
back.
so
for
purposes
of
the
recess
clause,
we
are
never
in
recess.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
verrilli,
6
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
argue
that
the
senate
sort
of
acquiesced
in
that
and
everybody's
come
together,
but
what
would
expect
a
senator
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
the
president
appoints
somebody
during
a
recess
contrary
to
the
respondent's
view,
what's
the
senator
who
objects
to
that
supposed
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
would
object
to
that,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
same
grounds
that
you're
objecting
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
that's
not
something
that
is
effective
for
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
think
it's
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
senate
says
we
don't
agree
with
the
recess
appointment,
and
you
say,
well,
it's
too
bad,
the
appointee
is
still
in
office.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
some
did
--
senator
byrd--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--famously
objected
to
the
president's
assertion
of
that
power.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand.
your
idea
is
the
senator
who
objects
should
do
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
suppose
the
senator
says,
look,
i
object
to
that,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional,
but
i'm
not
going
to
--
what
can
i
do?
the
only
think
you
can
do
is
impeach
the
president,
right,
for
violating
the
constitution.
and
he
says
it's
not
worth
it
for
the
--
one
of
the
offices--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
would
you
say
that
action
would
be
totally
ineffective?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
take
a
few
more
minutes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
