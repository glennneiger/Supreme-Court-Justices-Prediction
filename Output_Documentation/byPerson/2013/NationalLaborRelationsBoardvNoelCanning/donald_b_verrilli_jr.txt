mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
interpretation
of
the
recess
appointments
clause
that
respondent
urges
would
repudiate
the
constitutional
legitimacy
of
thousands
of
appointments
by
presidents
going
back
to
george
washington,
and
going
forward,
it
would
diminish
presidential
authority
in
a
way
that
is
flatly
at
odds
with
the
constitutional
structure
the
framers
established.
respondent
simply
has
not
advanced
the
compelling
case
that
would
be
needed
to
strip
presidents
of
their
traditional
authority
to
make
appointments
during
intra-session
recesses
and
to
fill
preexisting
vacancies.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
but
they
--
no,
i
don't,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
certainly
would
repudiate
the
legitimacy
of
those
appointments.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
there
are
many
dozens
of
board
decisions
and,
perhaps,
many
hundreds
of
board
decisions
that
are
under
a
cloud
as
a
result
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case.
and
so,
the
board
will
have
a
considerable
amount
of
work
to
do
in
--
if
the
d.c.
circuit's
decisions
were
to
be
affirmed.
now,
there
would
be
issues
about
waiver,
there'll
be
issues
about
whether
there
--
there
is
authority
sufficient
to
justify
what
the
board
did
under
other
circumstances
or
apparent
authority
argument.
so
that
would
all
have
to
be
sorted
out
with
respect
to
the
board's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
be
a
very
serious
question,
justice
sotomayor,
and
i
think
it
does
point
up
the
--
the
difficulty
with
the
position
respondent
is
urging.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
we
would.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
we
would.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
would
certainly
hope
not,
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
casts
a
serious
cloud
over
the
legitimacy
of
all
of
those
actions.
and
it
does
point
up
the
fact
that
the
recess
power,
including
appointments
during
intra-session
recesses
and
to
fill
preexisting
vacancies
has
been
used
to
fill
offices
of
great
importance.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
now,
i
think
the
practice
has
to
prevail,
your
honor,
but
i
do
--
and
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but,
your
honor,
of
course,
in
this
situation,
the
meaning
of
the
clause
with
respect
to
the
timing
of
--
of
the
vacancy
has
been
a
matter
of
contention
since
the
first
days
of
the
republic.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
i've
answered
the
question
accepting
your
hypothesis,
but
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
the
practice
has
started
with
george
washington,
and
it
has
worked
through
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
--
i
think
i've
already
answered
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
practice
gives
meaning
to
the
--
the
practice
gives
meaning
to
the
constitution--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
extremely
unlikely
that
would
arise
if
the
text
were
so
free
of
doubt.
but
if--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i
am
--
i
am
answering.
i
think
i
already
answered
it
once,
justice
scalia,
but
i'll
answer
it
again.
the
answer
is
i
think,
given
this
--
a
practice
going
back
to
the
founding
of
the
republic,
the
practice
should
be
--
the
practice
should
govern,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
this
provision
has
been
subject
to
contention
as
to
its
meaning
since
the
first
days
of
the
republic.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
the
word
“
happens
”
may
not
always
be
an
apt
phrase,
the
phrase
“
may
happen
”,
the
constitutional
phrase,
but
it
is
a
natural
use.
and
if
i
may,
justice
alito,
i'll
give
you
a
counterexample.
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute
in
the
summer
of
2008
that
said
the
federal
reserve
is
invested
with
all
powers
necessary
to
deal
with
any
financial
emergency
that
may
happen
in
2009,
if
that
emergency
first
arose
in
november
of
2008
i
don't
think
anybody
would
interpret
that
statute
as
denying
the
federal
reserve
the
authority
that
congress
conferred.
and
that's
because
“
may
happen
”
--
“
may
happen
”
won't
cover
every
situation
of
a
persisting
state,
but
it's
certainly
a
natural
reading
of
it
that
covers
some.
and
as
jefferson
said,
it's
certain
--
in
this
context,
it's
certainly
susceptible
of
being
interpreted
to
mean--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so
i
think
i
have
two
points
to
make
in
response
to
the
question
of
what
to
do.
the
first
one
is
that,
with
respect
to
the
original
understanding,
we
do
think
that
the
term
“
recess
”
and
the
phrase
“
the
recess
”
certainly
at
the
time
of
the
founding
did
encompass
recesses
that
occurred
during
a
session
of
congress,
during
a
session
of
the
legislature,
and
not
just
in
between
sessions
of
the
legislature.
i
would
point
the
court
to
jefferson's
manual
of
parliamentary
procedure,
which
describes
a
recess
by
adjournment
as
occurring
within
a
session.
i
would
point
to
the
adjournment
clause
itself,
which
says
if
the
--
one
house
of
congress
wants
to
take
a
break
of
longer
than
3
days
during
the
session,
it
needs
the
consent
of
the
other
house,
which
indicates
that
the
framers
contemplated
the
possibility
of
a
break
longer
than
3
days.
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
parliamentary
practice
of
the
house
of
commons,
where
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
had
authority
to
call
elections
when
a
member
died
during
the
recess.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
--
the
way
we
resolve
that
problem
is
by
looking
to
the
adjournment
clause.
we
think
if
it's
a
break
that
is
sufficiently
short,
that
it
wouldn't
require
the
--
wouldn't
require
the
one
house
to
get
the
consent
of
the
other,
but
that's
a
de
minimis
recess
and
that's
not
a
recess
in
which
the
president
would
have
authority--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
but
the
problem
with
the
pro
forma
sessions,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
is
in
thinking
about
the
length
of
the
recess.
the
recess,
we
would
submit,
and
this
is
based
on
the
formal
dictionary
definition
of
“
recess
”
at
the
time
of
the
founding
and
now,
which
is
“
a
suspension
of
business
”,
the
recess
was
from
january
3
when
the
session
started
until
january
23.
and
the
reason
i
think
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
a
recess.
and
the
reason
is
because
the
senate
has
issued
a
formal
order
that
no
business
shall
be
conducted
and
that's
a
formal--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
it's
a
--
that's
a
different
case
and
i
think,
concededly,
a
significantly
harder
case
for
the
executive
because
here--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
is
significant,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
a
formal
action
by
the
senate
by
rule
saying
that
no
business
shall
be
conducted.
and
then
in
addition,
there
are
other
formal
actions
that
the
senate
took
during
this
period
that
are
confirming
indicia.
the
senate
passed
--
the
senate
passed
a
resolution
that
gave
committees
the
authority
to
submit
reports
and
report
bills.
they
passed
a
resolution
giving
the
--
the
president
pro
tempore
the
power
to
sign
enrolled
bills.
it
passed--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
there
has
to
be
a
limit
to
that
point,
justice
kagan,
because,
after
all,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
power
that
the
constitution
gives
to
the
president,
the
power
in
article
ii.
and
the
president
has
got
to
make
the
determination
of
when
there's
a
recess.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
sure.
of
course,
it
could.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
true.
they
could
--
they
could
decide
not
to
take
a
recess.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
absolutely
true.
but
--
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
choice
that
the
constitution
puts--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
our
view
is
that
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
senate
did
with
pro
forma
sessions
complies
with
either
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--or
there
is
another
option,
justice
breyer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
no.
i
don't
think
you
need
--
i
don't
think
you
need
to
write
that
opinion.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
because
you
might,
perhaps,
give
the
senate
some
deference
with
respect
to
requirements
that
apply
only
internally
to
the
congress.
but
when
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
senate's
use
of
pro
forma
sessions
in
a
manner
that
deprives
the
president
of
authority
that
article
ii
would
otherwise
give--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so
why--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so
it's
important
for
multiple
reasons
with
respect
to
practicalities
and
fundamental
questions
of
constitutional
structure.
let
me
start
with
practicalities
and
with
the
happens
point,
the
“
may
happen
”
point,
that
our
appendix
doesn't
purport
to
be
comprehensive
or
anything
like
comprehensive.
part
of
the
reason
why
it
can't
be
comprehensive
is
that
there
really
aren't
records
of
when
the
vacancy
first
arose
with
respect
to
huge
numbers
of
recess
appointments,
and
that's
because,
i
submit,
it
wasn't
considered
material.
but
second,
i
can
--
there
are
--
there
are
numerous
practical
examples
in
our
history
of
when
it
made
a
very
great
deal
of
difference
that
the
president
had
the
authority
to
make
an
appointment
to
a
vacancy
that
preexisted
the
recess.
we
have
mentioned
the
1948
example;
the
secretary
of
labor
dies
on
the
verge
of
a
very
extended
intra-session
recess
by
the
--
by
the
senate.
they're
going
to
be
out
for
a
month,
back
for
12
days,
and
then
out
all
the
way
from
june
--
they
go
out
in
june,
they're
out
for
a
month,
they
are
back
for
12
days,
and
then
they're
out
all
the
way
until
december
31st.
the
secretary
of
labor
dies
just
in
advance
of
them
going
out
in
june,
and
this
is
--
remember,
1948
is
a
period
of
significant
labor
unrest.
we
needed
a
secretary
of
labor
in
place.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
two
answers.
i
don't
think
its
original
purpose
has
disappeared.
i
mean,
the
nlrb
was
going
to
go
dark.
it
was
going
to
lose
its
quorum.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
that
gets
to
the
second
point,
which
is
that
it
may
be
true
as
a
matter
of
raw
power
that
the
senate
has
the
ability
to
sit
on
nominations
for
months
and
years
at
a
time,
but
that
is
100
miles
from
what
the
framers
would
have
expected.
if
you
look
at
what
hamilton
said
in
federalist
76
about
the
advice
and
consent
role
of
the
senate,
he
said
he
thought
it
would
be
a
power
that
was
rarely
exercised
and
would
operate,
if
at
all,
invisibly
or
silently.
and
in
the
early
days
of
the
republic,
it
was
--
advice
and
consent
was
a
matter
of
days.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
do
--
i
think
this
--
i
think
the
recess
power
may
now
act
as
a
safety
valve
given
that
intransigence,
and
that
is
actually
quite
consistent--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so
let
me
take
a
half
a
step
back,
if
i
could,
justice
ginsburg,
and
answer
that
question
in
this
way.
you
know,
perhaps
it
sounds
like
this
is
an
aggressive
assertion
of
executive
authority,
but
i'd
ask
the
court
to
think
back
to
federalist
51.
and
what
the
framers
were
most
concerned
about
was
that
congress,
in
the
separation
of
powers
calculus,
was
going
to
amass
authority
and
drain
authority
and
energy
from
the
executive,
and
therefore,
the
executive
needed
to
be
fortified
against
those
actions
by
congress.
and
one
specific
way
in
which
the
framers
decided
to
fortify
the
executive
was
by
rejecting
the
notion
that
the
appointment
power
should
reside
with
the
senate.
the
framers
considered
that
and
they
rejected
it.
and
the
reason
they
rejected
it,
as
this
court
noted
in
its
edmund
opinion,
was
--
was
to
protect
the
executive
against
encroachment
by
the
legislature.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
but
those
things
--
there
are
often
situations
in
which
the
senate
is
not
in
session
when
a
vacancy
becomes
open
or
needs
to
be
filled,
i
guess
would
be
the
more
accurate
way
to
say
it.
the
examples
--
i'll
give
you
another
example,
if
i
could,
from
the
1940s.
taft-hartley
gets
enacted
in
1947
in
the
summer.
one
requirement
of
taft-hartley
is
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb
must
enforce
the
ban
on
secondary
boycotts
within
a
fixed
period
of
time,
30
or
60
days.
well,
it
turns
out
there
is
no
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb
at
that
time,
so
president
truman--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
multi-member
boards,
the
vacancy
act
doesn't
cover
them.
that's
one
reason
we
have
the
problem
here.
but
beyond
that,
the
framers
made
a
judgment
that
this
wasn't
going
to
be
left
to
congressional
largesse.
that's
why
there
is
a
recess
appointment
clause,
and
it's
not
left
to
the
congress.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
but
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
seems
to
me
the
framers
made
a
different
judgment,
because
they
gave
the
president
both
the
power
to
call
back
in
extraordinary
circumstances
and
the
recess
appointment
power.
and
if
the
framers
had
intended
the
power
to
call
back
to
be
the
way
to
deal
with
vacancies
during
absences
of
the
senate,
then--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so,
what
i
would
say
about
this,
and
also
to
your
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
we
have,
i
would
submit,
a
stable
equilibrium
that
has
emerged
over
the
course
of
this
country's
history
between
the
two
branches.
after
all,
what
we
are
advocating
for
here
is
the
status
quo.
it
is
the
equilibrium
that
has
emerged
since
congress
--
since
the
senate
started
taking
lengthy
intra-session
recesses,
presidents
started
making
recess
appointments
during
those
recesses.
that
began
in
the
civil
war
days.
it's
continued
to
the
present.
the
president--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
winning
on
questions
1
and
2
would
be
of
great
importance
to
the
executive,
but
we
also
should
win
on
question
3,
and
here's
why:
there
isn't
a
long
history
reflecting
equilibrium
with
respect
to
the
use
of
pro
forma
sessions
in
order
to
restrict
the
president's
ability
to
use
the
recess
appointment
power.
there
really
is
no
history
before
2007
of
this
daisy
chaining
of
one
pro
forma
session
after
another
after
another
in
conjunction
with
an
order
that
no
business
shall
be
conducted.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
we
don't.
i
think
the
right
way
to
think
about
that
is
the
same
way
that
you
would
think
about
if
the
senate
declares
that
it's
in
recess
from
august
1st
until
september
15th
and
then
comes
back
early
because
an
emergency
has
happened,
for
example,
with
hurricane
katrina.
once
they
are
back
in
doing
business,
they
are
doing
business.
now,
what
the
senate
did
with
respect
to
the
legislation
your
honor
identified
was
they
came
out
of
pro
forma
session,
they
passed
legislation,
and
then
went
back
in
to
--
they
went
back
in
under
the
order
of
pro
forma
session.
so
they
take
that
action--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
that's
an
interpretation
that
really
can
be
squared
with
the
body
of
contemporaneous
evidence
from
the
time
of
the
framing.
and
i
would
start
with
the
text
of
the
constitution
itself
and
the
adjournment
clause,
which
is
at
page
91a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and
it
--
one
thing
it
says
is
that
"neither
house
during
the
session
of
the
congress
shall,
without
consent
of
the
other,
adjourn
for
more
than
3
days.
"
it
seems
clear
from
that
language
that
“
the
session
of
the
congress
”
is
referring
to
the
period
that
commences
on
the
constitutionally
prescribed
date
and
continues
until
the
congress
adjourns
sine
die,
because
otherwise
these
recesses
wouldn't
be
during
the
session
of
the
congress.
it's
also
clear
from
this
language
that
the
framers
at
least
contemplated
the
possibility
of
breaks
longer
than
3
days
within
sessions
because
they
provided
a
mechanism
to
get
permission
to
do
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
that's
right.
but
i'm
going
back
now
to
think
about
what
“
session
”
means
in
the
recess
appointment
clause
where
“
the
session
”
is
also
used.
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
means
the
same
thing
as
it
means
here,
which
is
the
full
session
of
the
congress.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
dictionary
definition
then
and
now
of
recess
is
a
suspension
of
business.
and
you
could
have
recesses
of
that
kind,
suspensions
of
business
within
sessions.
that's
--
jefferson's
parliamentary
manual
refers
to
recess
by
adjournment--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i'm
just
talking
now,
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
may,
about
the
intra-session
recess
point.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right,
but
with
respect
to
--
putting
the
pro
forma
issue
aside
for
a
second,
with
respect
to
intra-session
recesses,
the
meaning
of
the
“
session
”,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
session,
the
full
session,
because
you
can
have
--
you
can
have
recesses
by
adjournment,
as
jefferson's
parliamentary
manual
said.
and
as
i
think
i
said
earlier,
there
is
quite
substantial
evidence
that
the
term
“
the
recess
”
at
the
time
of
the
framing
could
refer
to
a
break
during
a
session
and
not
just
breaks
between
sessions.
so
i
just
don't
think
there
is
contemporaneous
evidence
from
the
framing
generation
that
would
lead
you
to
conclude
that
intra-session
recesses
are
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
“
recess
”.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
i
don't
think
that
that
--
i
don't
think
that's
its
purpose,
but
it
is
in
the
constitution.
the
president
has
the
authority
to
make
appointments--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
that
language
points
unambiguously
in
one
direction.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
a
vacancy
is
an
enduring
state,
and
from
the
perspective
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
tried
with
my
statutory
example
before,
but
from--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
it
was
about
an
emergency.
it
was
the
statutory
example
about
a
financial
emergency
that
may
happen,
which
is
state,
just
like
the
vacancy.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
a
vacancy
is
an
enduring
state.
from
the
perspective
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--your
honor,
maybe
this
statutory
--
maybe
the
language
in
the
constitution
looks
unambiguous
to
you
now,
but
it
has
been
the
subject
of
contention,
it
has
been
thought
to
be
ambiguous
from
the
time
of
george
washington
to
the
president
--
to
the
present.
and
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
practice
and
there
being
--
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
assume
that
because
there
are
a
certain
number
of
identified
examples
of
preexisting
vacancies
being
filled
in
our
appendix,
that
that's
the
sum
total.
i
think
this
is
far,
far
less
than
the
sum
total.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
it
happens--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
the
fact
that
“
may
happen
”
is
a
phrase
that
isn't
always
apt
to
describe
an
enduring
state.
it
doesn't
mean
it's
never
apt
to
describe
an
enduring
state.
it's
what
jefferson
thought.
it's
what
--
it's
--
it
has
been
the
understanding
since
the
framing
that
there
is
ambiguity
here
and
there--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
know
why
they
put
the
language
in
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
superfluous
because
it
does
serve
that
function,
whatever
their
intent.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
we
think
it's
just
what
wirt
said.
it's
--
does
no
violence
to
the
language
and
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
clause.
and
from
the
--
from
the
perspective
of
the
purpose
of
the
clause,
the
office
is
equally
vacant,
whether
that
vacancy
arose
the
day
before
or
the
day
after
the
senate
went
into
recess.
the
senate
is
equally
unavailable
to
act
because
they're
dispersed,
whether
the
vacancy
arose
the
day
before
or
the
day
after.
and
the
public's
need
that
the
office
be
filled
so
that
the
laws
can
be
faithfully
executed
is
the
same
whether
the
vacancy
arose
the
day
before
or
the
day
after.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
so
we
do
have
that
very
established
practice
that
is
completely
in
accord
with
the
purpose
and
the
structure.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
way
harder
case
for
us.
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
and
--
but
they're
two
things.
one
is
that
formalities
do
matter;
and
two,
going
back
to
the
point
you
made
earlier,
justice
kagan,
i
think
it's
not
an
accident
that
there's
a
no-business
order
in
place.
it's
because
that's
what
gives
the
senators
the
protection
to
know
that
they
can
leave
town
without
somebody
else
going
to
the
court
and
saying
to
conduct
business.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
they
did
business
each
of
the
three
days,
then
you
wouldn't
have
a
situation
in
which
no
business
was
conducted
and
you
wouldn't
meet
the
definition
of
a
recess.
but
that's
a
different
case
than
this
one.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
problem
with
looking
at
it
that
way,
justice
kagan,
is
that
that's
the
end
of
the
recess
appointment
power.
you
write
it
out
of
the
constitution,
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
because
all
the
senate
needs
to
do
is
stay
in
pro
forma
session
until
11:59
a.m.
on
january
3rd
when
that
term
ends
and
the
next
term
starts
and
then
there
are
no
intercession
recesses--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
this
does.
this
does.
and
whether
something
else
might
or
might
not,
i
guess
we
could
try
to
fight
that
out
if
the
senate
were
ever
to
do
it.
but
i
assume,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
pro
forma
sessions
of
this
kind
are
not
real
and
they
don't
defeat
the
president's
recess
appointment
power,
that
maybe
the
senate
would
think
twice
before
doing
something
like
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
would
be
a
different
case
because
they
would
be--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they
would
be
there
--
they
would
be
here.
you
know,
they're
not
--
they're
in
business
for
something.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it's
not,
because
the
recess
--
or
the
definition
of
recess
is
when
no
business
shall
be
conducted.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
senate
said.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
with
a
couple
of
points
on
intra-session
recesses.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
alito
raised,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
familiar
to
the
framers
that
a
legislative
body
could
take
an
intra-session
recess.
jefferson's
parliamentary
manual
written
while
he
was
vice
president
and
presiding
over
the
senate
specifically
refers
to
recesses
by
adjournment
that
occur
within
a
session
and
the
session
resumes
when
they
are
over.
the
adjournment
clause
itself
contemplates
the
need
for
approval
by
the
other
branch
for
a
period
longer
than
three
days
during
the
session.
i
think
it's
difficult
to
imagine
that
if,
as
justice
alito's
hypothetical
suggested,
that
the
senate
had
in
the
first
years
under
president
washington
decided
to
take
a
two-month,
intra-session
break,
that
president
washington
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
staff
the
offices
of
the
fledgling
republic
using
the
recess
appointment
power.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
think
the
number
should
be
--
should
be
the
number
in
the
adjournments
clause,
3
days
or
less.
now,
presidents
have
exercised
restraint
and
there
haven't
been
recess
appointments
in
periods
below
10
days,
but
we
think
that
would
be
the
line.
now--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
there
isn't
really
a
need
for
explanation.
a
recess
is
a
suspension
of
business,
and
what
the
adjournment
clause
says
is
if
you
are
gone
for
3
days
or
less
you
are
not
really
suspending
your
business,
but
if
you
are
gone
for
more
than
3
days
you
are.
and
i
think
that
is
quite
consistent
with
the
argument
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
making.
now,
with
respect
to
the
history
on
intra-session
recess
appointments,
really
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
directory,
which
is
a
document
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
you
look
at
the
column
that
says
intra-session
recesses,
you
will
see
page
after
page
of
blank
space
until
you
get
to
the
civil
war
era
when
intra-session
recesses
become
more
frequent.
and
intra-session
recess
appointments
really
just
precisely
parallel
the
increasing
use
by
the
senate
of
intra-session
recesses.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
if
they--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
a
couple
of
things
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
pay
act,
of
course,
was
first
enacted
in
this
period,
in
the
1860s,
when
the
first
intra-session
recess
appointments
occurred,
in
fact,
even
in
its
original
form
never
said
--
and
since,
never
said
anything
about
trying
to
restrict
intra-session
appointments.
if
the
congress
felt
that
these
were
improper,
they
could
have
done
what
they
did
in
the
tenure
of
office
act
and
passed
a
statute
of
making
it
a
crime
for
somebody
to
take
one
of
these
appointments.
but
they
didn't
do
anything
like
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
of
course.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we
would.
but
in
terms
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
in
terms
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--in
terms
of
an
expression
of
their
disagreement
as
opposed
to
acquiescence
it
would
certainly
be
a
question
of
disagreement,
and
it
didn't
happen.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
they
didn't,
i
guess,
would
be,
or
the
point
being--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--senators--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yeah,
but
he
famously
objected
to
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
saying
that
the
intra-session
recess
ought
to
be
30
days
or
longer,
not
that
intra-session
recesses
are
inappropriate
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
power.
so
i
actually
think
that
is
just
haggling
about
the
length
of
the
recess,
not
about
the
existence
of
the
power.
now,
if
i
can
move
to
the
question
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
the
senator
who
objects
can
say
whatever
the
senator
wants,
but
we
don't
have
a
historical
record
of
objection.
we
have
a
historical
record
of
acquiescence.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
if
the
congress
as
a
body
thought
that
these
were
inappropriate
they
could
take
legislative
action
to
try
to
limit
the
president's
authority,
and
they
just,
they
never
have.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we'd
agree
on
the
--
we'd
certainly
agree
on
the
criminalizing
point,
but
in
terms
of
the
pay
act,
for
example,
they
just
never
in
all
their
--
in
their
original
consideration
of
the
pay
act
and
subsequently,
they
never
tried
to
address
this.
now
if
i
could
turn
to
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and,
yes,
your
honor,
and
of
course
--
and
that's
an
individual
objecting
and
it's
not
the
senate
objecting.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
there
were
a
couple
of
committee
reports
but
i
believe
those
were
on
the
“
happen
”
issue,
and
let
me
turn
to
that,
if
i
could.
now
your
honor
had
pointed
out
the
number
of
--
happens
number
of
appointments.
as
i
said,
don't
take
that
chart
comprehensive.
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
it's
not;
we
think
there
are
many
more,
and
of
course
39
presidents
have
made
those
appointments.
now,
for
purposes
of
the
clause
as
we
discussed
earlier,
i
think,
are
far
better
served
by
our
reading
than
the
other
side's.
jefferson
gave
a
reasonable
textual
reading,
and
then
your
honor
asked
about
the
pay
act.
the
pay
act
of
course
says
if
the
nomination
--
if
the
vacancy
arose
within
30
days,
but
it
says
something
else,
too,
which
is
if
a
nomination
is
pending--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
guess
what
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
of
course.
and
what
i
would
point
out
by
analogy
also
is
that
there
is
another
provision
in
the
pay
act,
the
very
same
statute,
that
says
so
long
as
a
nomination
is
pending,
even
if
the
vacancy
arose
more
than
30
days,
that's
the
same
expression
of
congress's
views
about
what's
appropriate.
what
they
care
about
is
the
chance
to
exercise
their
advice
against
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
is
an
expression
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
that
the
congress
enacted.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
it,
as
i
said,
i
think
there
is
an
equilibrium
here
and
the
30
days
doesn't
fully
capture
it.
and
let
me
just
talk
about
that
if
i
could.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
briefly.
the
vast
majority
of
appointees
are
submitted
for
advice
and
consent.
that
was
true
historically;
it's
true
now.
the
vast
majority
of
recess
appointees
are
subsequently
confirmed.
so
it's
just
not
the
case
that
this
is
an
end
run
around
the
advice
and
consent
role
of
the
senate.
and
there
are
powerful
reasons,
of
course,
why
presidents
do
that.
they
don't
want
to
have
temporary
appointments
that
they
have
got
to
then
deal
with
vacancies
again,
and
they
don't
want
to
unnecessarily
create
interbranch
friction.
the
real
problem,
i
would
submit
here,
is
that
if
you
go
with
respondents
on
the
pro
forma
issue
or
under
the
--
on
the
two
underlying
issues,
the
d.c.
circuit
ruling,
you
are
really
are
writing
the
recess
appointment
power
out
of
the
constitution,
and
that's
antithetical
to
the
liberty-enhancing
properties
of
separation
of
powers
that
madison
described
in
federals
51,
because
ambitions
which
counteract
ambitions
shouldn't
disarm
one
side.
thank
you.
