how
did
it
--
how
did
it
affect
the
--
how
many
board
decisions
will
have
to
be
redone,
or
how
did
--
how
is
the
board
coping
with
that
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
we've
taken
you
off
your
starting
point.
your
starting
point
was
what
is
it
--
what
constitutes
a
recess.
and
your
position
is
that
it
can
be
an
intra-session
recess.
but
if
we
look
back
historically,
congress
met
and
they
met
continuously.
and
then
they
went
on
horseback
back
home
and
they
were
away
for
6
months,
even
9
months.
today,
there's
nothing
like
that.
the
inter-session
--
the
inter-session
recess
could
be
--
could
be
an
hour.
so
what
do
we
do
with
that?
there
was
the
vision
of
a
long
recess
running
for
months
and
today,
the
inter-session
recess
might
be
momentary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
tied
then
to
the
availability
of
the
congress,
availability
of
the
senate.
i
think
you
said
throughout
your
brief
that
the
rationale
for
the
recess
power
is
the
president
must
be
able
to
have
the
government
functioning
and
staffed
even
though
--
although
the
senate
isn't
--
isn't
around.
but
now
the
--
you
seem
in
your
answers
to
be
departing
from
the
senate
not
available
and
making
quite
another
justification
for
this.
the
senate,
i
think
to
be
candid,
the
senate
is
always
available.
they
can
be
called
back
on
very
short
notice.
so
what
is
it
that's
the
constitutional
flaw
here?
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
that
the
senate
isn't
available.
the
senate
is
available.
it
can
easily
be
convened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
have
--
you
do
have
the
one
that
you
relied
on
in
your
brief,
and
this
understanding
goes
back
at
least
to
1823,
and
the
--
the
wirt
letter,
attorney
general
wirt
said,
on
the
wording
--
maybe
on
the
wording,
the
case
is
not
strong.
but
the
purpose,
he
said,
you
would
be
honoring
the
letter
and
defying
the
spirit.
that
was
the
--
on
the
question
of
the
--
when
the
vacancy--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
you
--
before
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
--
we
sort
of
drifted
away
from
the
new
--
the
new
practice,
the
pro
forma
session.
and
you
were
asked,
suppose
there
was
nothing
in
the
resolution
about
they
would
conduct
no
business.
it
was
an
informal
understanding
that
they
wouldn't.
but
there
is
no
express
agreement
that
they're
not
going
to
conduct
business.
then
do
you
lose
on
that
part
of
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
argument
would
destroy
the
recess
clause.
there
would
be
--
under
your
argument,
it
is
totally
--
totally
within
the
hands
of
the
senate
to
abolish
any
and
all
recess
appointments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
we
have
an
inter-session
break.
it's
three
days.
on
your
reading
of
the
recess
clause,
in
that
three
days,
the
president
can
fill
up
vacancies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
leave
out
this
second
question.
just
on
--
on
the
first
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
if
the
rationale
was
when
congress
was
out
of
town
for
6,
9
months,
of
course,
the
president
has
to
be
able
to
make
the
government
work.
but
now
you're
saying
that
in
that
time,
it's
only
three
days,
they
are
going
to
be
there
available
very
soon
to
confirm.
and
let's
say
somebody
--
somebody
dies
on
day
1.
the
president
puts
in
--
makes
an
appointment
on
day
2.
you
would
say
that's
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
is
a
3-day
recess
between
sessions,
then
your
argument
is
that
--
that
is
a
recess
and
the
president
can
make
--
can
make
appointments
in
that
time.
