well,
of
course,
justice
ginsburg's
question
points
out
that
your
argument
is,
it
seems
to
me,
in
search
of
a
limiting
principle.
a
lunch
break,
a
one-day
break
--
you've
--
you've
thought
about
this
--
a
3-day
break,
a
1-week
break,
a
1-month
break;
how
do
you
resolve
that
problem
for
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
about
the
pro
forma
sessions,
then?
they
don't
--
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
they
don't
require
the
consent
of
the
other
house.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
you
think
there's
no
recess
during
pro
forma
sessions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
searching
here
for
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
word
“
session
”,
which,
after
all,
is
in
the
provision
that
we
are
looking
at.
it
talks
about
“
next
session
”.
and
we
have
a
long
tradition
of
congress
defining
what
that
session
is.
they
have
the
first
--
this
is,
what,
the
113th
congress?
i
think
something
like
that.
and
they
have
the
first
and
second
session.
that's
how
their
records
are
based.
this
is
a
considered
judgment
by
both
houses
of
the
legislative
branch
as
to
what
“
session
”
means,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
has
very
powerful
bearing
on
the
question
of
inter
and
intra-session
appointments
that
we
are
arguing,
forget
the
--
when
the
vacancy
happens
to
arise.
and
so
why
don't
--
why
don't
we
defer
to
congress
as
to
what
the
term
“
session
”
means
and
say
that
this
gives
us
guidance
as
to
when
the
--
there
is
a
recess.
there
is
a
recess
between
those
sessions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
relying
on
adjournment.
that
--
that
--
that
does
not
have
the
word
“
recess
”.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
where
is
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
history
is
simply
too
overwhelming
to
rule
in
your
favor
on
the
“
happens
”
problem.
could
we
still
use
history
to
say
that
--
or
overlook
history
to
rule
for
you
on
the
inter/intra-session
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
we
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
because
of
the
80
years
or?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
constitution
as
it
--
as
it
first
was
has
now
been
amended
and
it
is
no
longer
a
part
of
the
constitution,
with
reference
to
appointment
of
senate,
uses
the
word
“
vacancy
”
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
clause
we're
discussing
here,
and
i
think
favors
your
position,
because
if
a
vacancy
happens
by
resignation
during
the
recess
of
the
legislature
then
the
governor
can
make
the
appointment.
and
you
certainly
wouldn't
think
that
that
could
happen
over
3
days--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--occur
over
--
i
should
say
occur
over
3
days.
