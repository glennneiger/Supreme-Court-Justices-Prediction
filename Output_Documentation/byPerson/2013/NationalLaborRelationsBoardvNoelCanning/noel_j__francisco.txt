mr.
noel
j.
francisco
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
advice
and
consent
clause
imposes
an
important
check
on
executive
power.
each
of
our
three
arguments
preserves
that
check,
and
provides
a
separate
and
independent
basis
for
affirming
the
court
below.
the
government's
position,
in
contrast,
would
eviscerate
that
check,
creating
a
unilateral
appointment
power
available
for
every
vacancy
at
virtually
any
time
with
advice
and
consent
to
be
used
only
when
convenient
to
the
president.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
reflects
the
fact
that
the
recess
appointment
power
is
a
contingent
one.
it
arises
only
when
the
senate
chooses
to
trigger
it
by
ending
its
session
and
beginning
its
recess.
so
the
senate
always
has
the
power
to
prevent
recess
appointments.
the
constitution,
however,
gives
the
president
corresponding
powers.
if
the
president
thinks
that
the
senate
is
being
derelict
in
its
duties,
he
can
convene
an
emergency
session,
and
he
can
force
the
senate
to
consider
his
nominees.
and
if
they
refuse,
he
can
subject
them
to
withering
criticism
for
being
derelict
in
their
responsibilities.
but
one
--
the
one
thing
that
the
president
may
not
do
is
force
the
senate
to
act
against
its
will,
nor
should
the
president
be
permitted
to
do
--
and
run
around
the
senate's
refusal
to
act,
because
that
conception
of
the
recess
appointments
clause
is
at
war
with
advice
and
consent
itself.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
language
has
to
govern.
and
i
would
like
to
address
the
issue
about
the
consequences
of
a
ruling
in
our
favor
in
this
case.
of
course,
if
you
were
to
rule
on
the
third
question
presented,
it
wouldn't
call
into
question
any
past
recess
appointments
at
all,
given
the
unprecedented
nature
of
the
appointments
at
issue
in
this
case.
but,
frankly,
if
you
ruled
on
the
first
two
questions,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
particularly
disruptive
in
terms
of
calling
it
a
question,
the
decisions
of
past
appointees.
justice
sotomayor,
to
take
the
article
iii
courts,
for
example,
since
1960,
there
have
only
been
four
potentially
improper
appointments
to
the
article
iii
court's
recess
appointments.
each
of
them
served
approximately
a
year
or
less.
three
were
to
the
court
of
appeals,
one
to
a
federal
district
court
judge
in
1981.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
the
relevant
history
actually
supports
us,
that
is
the
history
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
dispute
the
premises,
but
i
will
accept
the
premises
for
the
purposes
of
the
question.
the
political
branches
of
the
government
have
no
authority
to
give
or
take
away
the
structural
protections
of
the
constitution.
they
don't
exist
to
protect
the
senate
from
the
president
or
the
president
from
the
senate.
these
are
liberty-protecting
provisions
that
protect
the
people
from
the
government
as
a
whole.
so
if
the
constitution
is
quite
clear
as
to
what
those
structural
protections
are,
but
the
political
branches,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
have
conspired
to
deplete
them,
that
is
illegitimate,
and
it
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor,
a
couple
of
different
responses.
first
of
all,
we
dispute
the
government's
historical
account
of
president
washington's
and
the
first
four
presidents'
position
--
actions.
but
even
putting
that
aside
here,
everyone
who
actually
spoke
to
and
addressed
the
issue
at
the
time
agreed
that
the
text
means
precisely
what
it
says,
including
president
madison,
who
refused
to
make
a
recess
appointment
to
andrew
jackson,
the
hero
of
the
war
of
1812,
precisely
because
the
vacancy
had
arisen
during
the
senate's
session
and
in
its
recess.
second,
we
also
don't
have
an
unbroken
and
never
contested
practice.
indeed,
the
senate
has
regularly
resisted.
in
1863,
the
senate
passed
the
pay
act,
which
prohibited
pay
to
any
appointee
to
a
preexisting
vacancy.
so
you
don't
have
a
kind
of
uniform
--
uniformly-held
practice.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
from
the
time
of
the
founding--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--i
think
it's
longer
than
that.
from
the
time
of
the
founding
until,
i
would
say,
1948,
there
was
a
uniform
understanding
that
the
recess
and
the
session
as
used
in
the
clause
were
interchanging
periods.
you
were
either
in
recess
or
you
were
in
session.
and
so
an
appointment
made
during
the
recess
lasted
until
the
end
of
the
next
session.
now,
in
1921
attorney
general
doherty's
opinion
kind
of
muddled
things
a
bit
because
he
assumed
that
if
you
took
a
long
break
in
the
midst
of
a
long
session,
it
broke
that
break
into
two
recesses
for
the
purposes
of
the
recess
appointments
clause.
but
you
still
had
that
dichotomous
view
subject
to
the
arguable
and
quite
ambiguous
exception
of
president
andrew
johnson.
so
what
you
see
is
from
the
time
of
the
founding
until
1921
there
were
some
63
mid-session
breaks,
all
longer
than
3
days,
so
all
recesses
under
the
government's
definition.
yet
during
that
entire
period,
with
the
arguable
exception
of
andrew
johnson,
no
president
ever
attempted
to
make
a
recess
appointment.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
let
me
address
it
this
way.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
the
factual
understanding,
your
honor.
there
were
intra-session
recesses
longer
than
3
days
prior
to
1867.
i
think
there
were
some
10
of
them
prior
to
1867,
including
7
that
were
longer
than
10
days.
and
bear
in
mind,
yes,
they
were
christmas
recesses,
but
so
were
the
ones
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
were
christmas
recess
appointments.
but
i
do
take
your
point
that
intra-session
recess
appointments
did
not
become
very
common,
or
i
should
say
it
this
way:
intra-session
recess
appointments
did
not
become
very
common
until
--
really
they
started
with
truman,
but
then
they
broke
off
for
a
long
time
with
three
presidents,
johnson,
kennedy,
and
ford,
making
no
mid-session
recess
appointments.
then
beginning
in
the
carter
and
the
reagan
administrations
is
when
they
became
very
common
and
particularly
a
very
common
way
to
do
an
end-run
around
advice
and
consent.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
attempt
to
purport
to
resolve
this
court's
differences
on
those
issues,
but
on--
[laughter]
--unless
you
are
not
going
to
let
me
off
the
hook,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
reflects
the
fact
that
the
recess
appointments
clause
and
the
appointments
clause
and
all
of
the
structural
protections,
again,
are
not
meant
to
protect
the
branches
against
one
another.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
right.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
different
responses.
first,
of
course,
the
third
question
calls
into
question
no
past
recess
appointees,
the
third
question.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
sure.
well,
i
will
put
my
finger
on
that
question
and
answer
your
first
question
first
as
to
the
pay
act
in
1940.
the
pay
act
of
1940,
in
our
view,
clearly
repudiates
the
government's
inter-session
view
for
the
reason
you
put
your
finger
on.
it
ties
pay
to
appointments
being
made
either
right
before
or
after
the
session
ends.
so
most
mid-session
recess
appointees
can't
get
paid
under
the
pay
act.
with
respect
to
the
second
question
presented,
at
best
it
creates
three
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
against
any
pay
to
any
preexisting
appointees,
so
you
have
got
somewhat
of
a
compromise.
i
would
say
that
is
no
more
senate
acquiescence
in
the
president's
position
than
the
president's
acquiescence
in
the
senate's
position
when
he
signed
that
law.
so
to
me
that's
a
jump
ball.
coming
back
to
your
historical
example,
i
think
it
reflects
the
fact
that
the
recess
appointments
clause
is
not
about
timing,
it's
not
a
temporal
issue;
it's
about
procedure.
what
it
does
is
it
creates
a
contingent
power
that
arises
when
the
senate
decides
to
trigger
it.
back
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
the
senators
wanted
to
trigger
that
power.
it
was
important
to
trigger
that
power,
because
when
they
were
gone,
the
president
needed
to
be
able
to
act
unilaterally,
unless
they
wanted
to
be
subject
to
a
recall
in
emergency
sessions
every
time
he
needed
to
confirm
nominees.
they
obviously
didn't
want
that.
today,
the
situation
has
changed;
not
the
principle,
but
the
historical
context.
and
today,
the
senators
can
get
back
to
washington,
d.c.
very
easily.
they
are
there
for
much
less--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--yes,
your
honor,
because
under
the
second
question
presented,
there
would
not
be
very
many
vacancies
in
that
context,
because
the
vacancy
would
have
to--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
--
first
of
all,
i'd
say
i
don't
think
you
can
really
separate
it
from
the
second
question
presented
because
that's
why
--
it
explains
why
it
wouldn't
have
been
much
of
a
problem.
very
few
vacancies
would
arise
during
a
3-day
break,
and
so
there
wouldn't
be
that
much
of
an
opportunity
to
make
those
kinds
of
appointments.
let's
put
that
aside.
let
me
assume
you
reject
my
argument
on
the
second
question
presented.
then
you're
really
in
the
world
of
the
1905
senate
report
when
they
were
dealing
with
president
roosevelt's
midnight
recess
appointments,
where
he
made
them
in-between
gavel
drops.
if
you
reject
their
argument
on
the
second
question,
then
i
do
think
that
you
may
need
to
confront
the
notion
that
an
inter-session
recess
is
too
short
to
make
recess
appointments.
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
here
the
appointments
came
on
january
4th,
the
day
after
congress
commenced
the
second
session.
so
by
anyone's
definition,
this
was
an
intra-session
recess
appointment,
not
an
inter-session
recess
appointment.
and
all
of
this
really
reflects
the
fact
that
the
recess
appointments
clause
is
a
contingent
power
that
arises
only
when
the
senate
triggers
it,
which
is
what
gives
the
senate
the
power
to
prevent
the
president
from
making
recess
appointments.
if
i
could
turn
back
to
the
consequences--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--your
honor,
under
the
first
question
presented,
i
think
the
answer
is,
yes,
they
could
do
that,
because
it
really
is
the
senate's
ability
to
trigger
the
power.
it's
--
in
a
sense,
the
recess
appointments
clause
is
of
a
piece
with
the
inferior
officer's
clause.
the
senate
always
has
the
power
of
advice
and
consent,
but
what
the
president
can
do
--
what
the
senate
can
do
is
authorize
the
president
to
act
unilaterally
in
certain
circumstances.
it
can
authorize
the
president
to
act
unilaterally
with
respect
to
inferior
officers
and
it
can
authorize
the
president
to
act
unilaterally
in
certain
time
periods
where
it
ends
its
session
and
begins
its
recess.
so
it's
always
within
the
senate's
power.
and
that's
precisely
why
advice
and
consent
serves
as
an
important
check.
on
the
third
question
presented,
i
think
--
where
you're
deciding
whether
or
not
a
session
is
a
real
session,
then,
no,
i
don't
think
the
senate
could
do
that.
i
think
that
it's
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
senate's
journal
to
see
what
the
facts
are,
and
those
facts
must
be
taken
by
this
court
as
undisputed.
so
if
those
facts
show
that
there
was
a
senator
who
actually
gaveled
them
into
session
each
day,
and
that
during
that
period
they
were
capable
of
conducting
business,
as
they
were
here
at
every
session
that
they
held
every
three
days,
then
this
court
would
have
to
take
those
facts
as
a
given.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
it's
when
the
senate
--
again,
it
depends
on
which
question
you're
talking
about.
on
the
first
question
presented,
the
recess
of
the
senate
is
the
period
between
when
the
senate
says
that
it
is
ending
its
session
through
an
adjournment
sine
die,
and
the
period
when
it
begins
its
next
session,
as
the
clause
says.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
sine
die?
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
it
does
not--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--it
does
not
have
to
adjourn
sine
die.
that,
though,
in
this
country,
is
the
way
that
the
senate
has
traditionally
signaled
to
the
president
that
it
was
ending
its
session.
and
i
think
that's
what
it
would
have
to
do.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
i
don't
--
i
think
--
no,
i
don't
think
it
has
to.
i
think
the
senate
can
adopt
its
own
rules
for
determining
how
it
ends
its
session
and
how
it
begins
a
new
one.
i
think
the
important
point,
though,
is
it
has
to
communicate
that
to
the
president.
so,
for
example,
during
president
madison's
time,
the
tradition
was
the
senate
would
dispatch
a
committee
to
the
president
to
inform
this
president
that
it
had
ended
its
session.
so
the
president
now
knew
that
it
was
in
recess
and
the
powers
that
imbue
upon
the
president
during
that
recess
had
been
triggered,
the
recess
appointment
power.
here,
ruling
on
our
--
in
our
favor
on
the
third
question
would,
of
course,
call
in
the
question
no
past
appointees.
but
i
would
like
to--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--right.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
your
honor,
our
argument
does
not
turn
on
that
because
to
us,
it
is
not
a
temporal
question;
it's
a
procedural
one.
back
then,
the
senate
had
the
power
not
to
trigger
the
recess;
just
like
today,
it
has
the
power
not
to
trigger
the
recess
appointments
power.
the
difference
is
not
in
principle;
it's
in
historical
context.
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
they
wanted
to
trigger
the
recess
appointments
power
because
when
they
left
during
long
periods
of
time,
they
wanted
the
president
to
be
able
to
act
unilaterally
since
it
was
very
difficult
for
them
to
get
back.
and
if
they
didn't
trigger
the
power,
the
only
way
the
president
could
act
unilaterally
would
--
the
only
way
the
president
could
confirm
nominees
would
be
by
convening
an
emergency
session.
highly
inconvenient.
the
historical
facts
today
have
changed.
not
the
principle,
but
the
surrounding
facts.
and
today,
it
is
very
easy
for
the
senators
to
get
back
to
washington,
d.c.,
and
so
they
don't
want
to
trigger
a
unilateral
power.
they're
perfectly
willing
to
be
hailed
back
if
necessary.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
your
honor,
it
is
possible
that
they
never
thought
about
it.
but
even
if
they
had,
i
don't
think
it
would
matter,
because
i
think
that
--
that
the
purpose
that
you've
laid
out
is
not
quite
the
full
purpose
of
the
clause.
the
purpose
was
also
to
ensure
that
the
president
could
not
easily
do
an
end
run
around
advice
and
consent,
which
after
all
is
the
principal
method
of
appointment.
and
so
what
they
did,
as
they
did
with
respect
to
inferior
officers,
is
they
vested
with
the
senate
the
power
in
certain
circumstances
to
authorize
the
president
to
act
unilaterally.
with
respect
to
recesses,
that
authority
was
triggered
when
the
senate
decided
to
end
its
session.
the
senate
did,
for
example,
take
7
mid
session
breaks
of
longer
than
10
days
prior
to
1867.
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
senators
at
that
time
believed
that
they
were
entering
into
a
recess
that
would
have
empowered
the
president
to
make
unilateral
appointments
during
those
10-,
11-,
or
12-day
periods.
and
that
reflects
the
fact
that
the
recess
appointments
clause
is
a
--
is
a
contingent
one
that
arises
when
the
senate
triggers
it.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
sure.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
well,
your
honor,
i
actually
think
the
word
“
happens
”
had
the
same
meaning
then
as
it
does
now,
which
is
why
at
the
time
of
the
framing
everyone
who
actually
studied
the
issue
--
madison,
hamilton,
both
of
the
first
two
attorneys
general,
edmund
randolph
and
charles
lee
--
agreed
that
it
meant
what
it
said,
as
did
even--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--and
then
jefferson
in
his
other
letters
conceded
that
the
recess
appointments
clause
as
it
stood
was
going
to
frustrate
his
ability
to
make
appointments.
and
he
therefore--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--and,
yes,
your
honor,
but
in
addition,
though,
there
--
there
is
not
just
the
word
“
happen
”.
it's
preceded
by
three
other
words,
that
--
“
vacancies
that
may
happen
”.
and
the
only
purpose
that
those
words
serve
is
to
constrain
the
universe
of
vacancies
that
are
eligible
for
a
recess
appointment.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
exactly,
your
honor--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--and
--
and
it's
even
better
than
that
because
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
a
legislator
--
a
governor
tried
to
appoint
somebody
to
the
senate
pursuant
to
the
clause
that
had
arisen
--
where
the
vacancy
had
arisen
during
the
legislative
session
rather
than
during
the
legislative
recess,
and
the
senators
actually
refused
to
seat
that
individual.
so,
yes,
that
further
supports
our
position
on
that.
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
and
your
honor--
mr.
noel
j.
francisco
--that's
a
consequence
of
advice
and
consent.
that
problem
arises
not
just
when
the
senate
takes
breaks,
but
when
the
senate
is
in
session.
the
senate
could
show
up
every
day
for
an
hour,
sit
at
their
desks,
and
announce
to
the
president:
we're
not
going
to
do
anything,
no
nominations,
no
legislation,
because
we
don't
like
what
you're
doing.
and
by
the
way,
the
only
reason
we're
showing
up
here
at
our
desks
and
sitting
here
for
one
hour
a
day
is
because
we
don't
want
you
to
be
able
to
make
recess
appointments.
nobody
would
claim
that
the
senate
was
in
recess
during
those
sessions.
well,
that
is
effectively
what
it
was
doing
here.
i
would,
though,
like
to
address
the
practicality
issue.
i
talked
about
how
there
have
only
been
four
recess
appointments
to
the
article
iii
courts
that
are
potentially
invalid
since
1960.
i
likewise
don't
think,
if
you
were
to
rule
in
our
favor
on
the
first
two
questions,
that
it
would
be
particularly
disruptive
to
the
executive
branch
either.
if
you
look
at
the
government's
appendix,
i
would
hazard
to
say
that
most
of
those
officials
probably
don't
exercise
much,
if
any,
agency
rule-making
or
adjudicatory
power
at
all.
but
as
to
those
who
do,
going
forward
the
government
can
solve
the
problem
through
agency
ratification
of
past
decisions.
going
backward,
there
are
a
variety
of
doctrines
that
would
limit
anybody's
ability
to
actually
challenge
those
past
actions,
including,
for
example,
the
apa's
6-year
statute
of
limitations
on
challenging
final
agency
action,
various
finality
rules
that
would
prohibit
a
party
from
raising
an
issue
that
they
could
have
but
failed
to
raise
in
an
earlier
proceeding,
and
various
justiciability
doctrines,
like
mootness,
standing,
and,
your
honor,
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine,
at
least
outside
of
the
context
of
direct
appeal.
i
think
this
constellation
of
issues
probably
explains
why
this
is
the
first
time
this
issue
has
reached
this
court
in
225
years.
this
is
not
to
say
that
a
ruling
in
our
favor
on
the
first
two
questions
wouldn't
have
any
past
impact.
it
would
undoubtedly
have
some.
but
as
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
chada
and
booker
and
blakeley
make
clear,
this
court
has
never
shied
away
from
enforcing
the
strictures
of
the
constitution
simply
because
it
could
have
some
impact
on
prior
cases.
here
the
structural
protections
of
the
constitution
exist
to
protect
the
liberty
of
the
people.
they
were
clearly
transgressed
with
these
unprecedented
appointments,
and
therefore
we
believe
that
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
i
am
happy
to
answer
any
additional
questions
that
your
honors
may
have.
