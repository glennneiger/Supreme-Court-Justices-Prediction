justice
antonin
scalia
well,
surely,
you
would
--
you
would
argue
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we've
applied
that
in
innumerable
cases.
you
don't
really
think
we're
going
to
go
back
and
rip
out
every
decision
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
started
off
by
saying,
you
know,
it
would
--
it
would
repudiate
so
many
actions
that
have
been
taken.
i
have
a
very,
very
stark
question:
suppose
i
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
only
--
the
only
interpretation
of
--
of
the
constitution
is
that
the
vacancy
must
have
arisen
during
the
recess,
just
by
hypothesis.
i
agree
with
that,
okay?
what
do
you
do
when
there
is
a
practice
that
--
that
flatly
contradicts
a
clear
text
of
the
constitution?
which
--
which
of
the
two
prevails?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
ignore
the
constitution--
justice
antonin
scalia
--often
enough,
its
meaning
changes?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you're
--
you're
questioning
my
hypothesis.
you
have
to
accept
my
hypothesis.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
the
text
is
clearly
against
you.
should
i
say,
oh,
yes,
it
--
it
says
something
else,
but
the
practice
for
over
200
years
has
been
something
different
and
it's
the
practice
that
must
prevail.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
practice
prevail
over
the
clear
text--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
questioning
my
--
my
hypothesis
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
assuming
a
clear
text
of
the
constitution
and
a
practice
that
is
--
is
contrary
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not
want
to
answer
my
hypothesis.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
--
let's
go
to
that
1948
emergency,
the
secretary
of
labor.
there
was
a
vacancy
in
--
in
that
post.
the
president
has
the
authority
to
convene
congress.
and
whatever
was
the
case
in
1948
or
--
or
in
1789,
congress
can
be
back
here
in
one
day.
article
ii,
section
3
says,
"he
may,
on
extraordinary
occasions,
convene
both
houses.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what's
the
problem?
if
there
is
indeed
this,
you
know,
this
terrible
emergency
you're
talking
about,
the
president
has
the
power
to
call
them
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
my
only
point
is
what
--
what
the
recess
appointment
power
consists
of
cannot
be
determined
on
the
basis
that,
well,
there
are
going
to
be
terrible
emergencies,
so
it
must
enable
the
president
to
do
this
or
that.
extraordinary
emergencies
are
handled
in
the
constitution.
you
don't
have
to
expand
the
--
the
vacancy
appointment
power
in
order
to
handle
those.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
--
it's
been
assumed
to
be
--
it's
been
assumed
to
be
ambiguous
by
self-interested
presidents.
[laughter]
of
course.
death
is
an
enduring
state.
but
if
someone
dies
in
1941,
you
don't
say
he
died
in
1945.
he's
still
dead.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
his
death
happened
in
1941.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
two
examples
that
justice
breyer
gives
are
examples
where
we
gave
it
a
meaning
that
was
different
from
what
it
said.
[laughter]
we
don't
have
a
case
involving
this
particular
issue
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
think
“
happens
”
continues
to
mean
“
chances
to
be
”.
we
still
use
it
that
way.
but
we
only
use
it
that
way
when
it
is
followed
by
an
infinitive.
“
i
happened
to
see
him
”,
it
means
a
chance
that
i
saw
him.
or
--
you
know,
the
9/11,
the
destruction
of
the
twin
towers
happened
to
occur
on
9/11.
but
you
wouldn't
say
--
you
wouldn't
say
it
happened
on
--
on
9/13,
simply
because
it
continued
to
be
destroyed.
i
don't
know
what
the
oed
examples
that
justice
kagan
referred
to
were,
but
i
bet
they
--
they
used
“
happen
”
followed
by
an
infinitive,
and
i
think
we
still
use
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
was
that
senate.
i
mean,
that's
not
the
senate
that
is
sitting
now.
you
are
attributing
the
views
of
one
senate
to
the
senate
over
--
over
time.
