justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
happen,
under
the
reasoning
of
this
case,
what
would
happen
to
the
decisions
of
recess-appointed
judges?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
of
which
there's
been
quite
a
few.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
3
days?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why?
you're
making
an
assumption,
which
is
that
the
senate
has
to
take
a
recess.
but
the
senate
could
choose,
if
it
wanted
to,
and
i
think
there
might
be
some
citizens
that
would
encourage
it
to,
to
never
recess.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
--
and
to
work
every
day,
which--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--lots
of
people
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
it
means
the
same
thing,
then
you
are
tying
the
two
together,
which
actually
might
have
some
validity.
but
wouldn't
that
require
the
definition
of
a
recess
to
be
a
period
in
which
both
houses
have
chosen
to
consent
to
an
adjournment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
have
an
adjournment
without
a
suspension
of
business?
aren't
the
two
the
same?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
talking
about
tying
the
two
together.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
--
but
that
assumes
something,
which
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--let's
go
back
to
the
“
happenings
”
words
--
that
is
so
unambiguous,
that
they
knew
it
was
unambiguous,
but
200-year
history,
starting
with
president
washington,
who
filled
two
vacancies
that
occurred
before
the
senate
broke,
to
every
--
almost
every
president
thereafter
has
done
the
same.
so
why
should
we
conclude
that
today's
understanding
is
the
same
as
the
understanding
of
the
founding
fathers?
why
don't
we
take
their
unbroken
practice
as
giving
us
that
definition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
tell
--
let's
go
back
to
this.
what's
your
definition
of
a
recess?
when
the
senate
actually
says
we're
taking
a
recess--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whether
it
got
the
consent
of
the
house
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
it
have
to
do
that?
by
what
command
does
it
have
to
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
sine
die
or
any--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--does
it
need
the
consent
of
the
house
to
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
so
does
it
have
to
do
that
in
between
the
two
congressional
sessions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
estrada--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
estrada,
in
your
earlier
example,
you
said
that
if
the
senate
decides
to
recess
and
the
house
doesn't
approve,
that
the
president
can
then
do
it.
is
it
your
belief
that
a
recess
is
only
something
that
both
houses
have
agreed
to?
a
break
in
business
that
both
houses
have
agreed
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
you
need
--
why
does
the
president
have
to
adjourn
the
house
in
your
example?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
senate
votes
tomorrow
to
recess--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
the
president
appoint,
at
least
in
your
view,
any
vacancy
that
occurs
during
that
recess?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
do
you
need
a
date?
what
--
what
--
in
what
rule
makes
a
recess
defined
as
something
without
date?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
always
had
a
date,
because
we
knew
january
3rd
was
a
new
session.
