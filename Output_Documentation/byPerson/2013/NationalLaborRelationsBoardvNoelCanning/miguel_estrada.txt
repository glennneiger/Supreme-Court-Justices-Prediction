mr.
miguel
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
justice
kagan
recognized
earlier
in
the
argument,
this
case
fundamentally
is
about
who
gets
to
decide
whether
the
senate
is
in
recess,
the
senate
or
the
president?
our
submission
today
is
that
the
senate
gets
to
decide
whether
the
senate
is
in
recess.
mr.
miguel
estrada
this
is
--
this
is
all
about
how
the
senate
chooses
to
arrange
its
affairs,
justice
kagan,
under
the
rules
of
proceedings
act.
and
what
the
court
said
in
the
ballin
case
was
that
the
exercise
of
rulemaking
authority
by
congress
was
almost
absolute
and
beyond
the
challenge
of
any
body
or
tribunal
unless
it
usurped
some
independent
constitutional
authority.
the
only
possible
offer
here
that
the
solicitor
general
has
as
to
how
the
constitution
could
have
been
violated
by
the
actions
of
the
senate
in
arranging
its
own
affairs
is
the
notion
that
this
has
invaded
the
purported
recess
appointments
power
of
the
president.
and
the
reason,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
why
that
is
completely
insubstantial
is
because,
as
the
solicitor
general
recognizes
in
the
closing
two
pages
of
its
brief,
the
senate
by
the
design
of
the
constitution,
the
appointment
clause,
the
primary
method
of
appointment,
has
an
absolute
veto
over
nominations.
the
framers
could
not
have
been
more
clear
that
the
standard
power
of
appointment
was
a
joint
power
of
appointment.
and
therefore,
the
solicitor
general
is
forced
to
concede
that
this
appointment
power,
this
right
that
the
president
is
asserting
here
as
a
stop
on
the
exercise
of
the
rulemaking
authority,
is
a
subsidiary
power
that
only
arises
if
the
government
--
if
the
senate,
excuse
me,
chooses
to
recess.
mr.
miguel
estrada
if
the
senate
says,
we're
never
in
recess,
and
the
senate
then
is
not
in
recess
so
that
it
could
exercise
the
duties
of
its
office
as
it
does
here,
yes,
it
would
be.
if
the
senate
says,
we're
checking
out
and
going
to
hawaii,
we'll
never
again
be
in
washington,
kona
is
very
nice
this
time
of
year,
that
would
not
be
permissible,
because,
a,
the
adjournment
clause
requires
the
consent
of
the
house
for
the
senate
to
be
not
only
gone
for
3
days
but
to
be
in
a
different
place.
and
--
and
second,
you
know,
the
senate
cannot
leave,
you
know,
the
chamber,
and
--
other
than
with
the
--
with
the
consent
of
the
house.
and
maybe
if
the
senate
has
effectively
given
up,
you
know,
the
business
of
legislating,
in
that
case,
maybe
the
president
could
say
that
it
is,
quote,
a
“
recess
”.
now,
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
president's
position
here
is
twofold.
we
have
senate
records.
there
is
--
the
journal
clause
of
the
constitution
directs
each
house
of
the
congress
to
have
a
journal
of
its
proceedings.
the
journal
of
the
senate,
which
is
in
relevant
part
printed
in
our
appendix,
shows
that
on
each
of
the
disputed
dates
the
senate
was
called
to
order
and
then
adjourned.
it
is
an
official
record
of
the
senate.
it
says
the
senate
was
called
to
order
and
then
adjourned.
it
doesn't
say:
two
guys
who
happened
to
be
senators
met
at
a
bar
and
had
a
beer.
the
official
records
of
the
senate
say:
the
senate
was
called
to
order
and
adjourned.
and
under
the
rules
of
proceedings
clause,
that
would
be
conclusive,
full
stop.
mr.
miguel
estrada
it
would
be
the
same
unless
the
senate
chooses
to
recess.
mr.
miguel
estrada
right.
mr.
miguel
estrada
justice
breyer,
the
executive
at
the
time
could
have
attempted
to
construct
the
same
type
of
argument
that
the
executive
is
trying
to
construct
here--
mr.
miguel
estrada
--yes.
but
--
but
here,
it
is
even
a
weaker
argument
because
one
of
the
oddities
of
the
case
is
that
as
the
senate
has
--
and
the
country
have
all
moved
into
the
modern
age,
the
rules
of
the
senate
tend
to
provide
for
the
senate
to
be
available
at
the
drop
of
a
hat.
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
rule
9,
you
can
always
get,
you
know,
the
communications
from
houses
--
from
the
house
or
from
the
executive.
if
you
look
at
rule
26
of
the
senate,
committees
can
meet
whether
or
not
the
chamber
is
actually
in
session.
you
know,
the
business
of
the
senate
is
ongoing;
and
therefore,
in
the
modern
world,
it
is
even
much,
much,
much
different
than
even
the
hypothetical
that
you
posited.
mr.
miguel
estrada
in
1903.
mr.
miguel
estrada
yes,
constructive
recess.
mr.
miguel
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
estrada
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
take
that
as
an
opportunity
because
i
think
it
does
raise,
you
know,
the
question
to
speak
to
the
implication
that
the
solicitor
general
makes
in
his
brief,
that
the
senate,
as
a
body,
doesn't
have
a
view
on
whether
it
was
in
recess
or
in
session.
for
the
reason
that
i
started
out
by
outlouding
--
by
outlining
--
excuse
me
--
the
senate's
official
records
do
show
that
the
senate
was
in
session
on
each
date,
and
therefore,
the
senate
does
have
an
official
view.
but
from
the
practical
point
of
view,
we
do
know
that
the
senate
has
a
view
on
these
things.
and
how
do
we
know?
the
president's
party
controls
the
senate.
if
the
senate
wanted
to
recess,
rule
22nd
of
the
senate
says
that's
not
a
debatable
proposition.
if
a
majority
of
the
senate
wants
to
recess,
even
before
the
evolution
of
the
filibuster,
non-debatable
proposition.
so
the
senate
says,
which
is
controlled
by
the
president's
party,
says,
we
want
to
recess,
we
want
to
go
away,
we
don't
care
if
the
president
has
this
power.
they
vote
for
that.
house
says
no.
what
happens
then?
article
ii,
section
3
of
the
constitution,
the
fight
goes
to
the
president,
and
it
is
in
that
event
that
the
president
gets
to
adjourn
them
until
such
date
as
he
shall
see
proper.
so
if
the
senate
had
any
view
that
it
wanted
to
recess,
they
could
have
had
a
vote,
and
the
issue
would
have
ended
up
in
the
white
house,
in
the
lap
of
the
president.
he
had
plenary
constitutional
power
to
give
himself
an
inter-session
recess
by
terminating
the
session
and
have
a
real
recess
appointment
power
if
he
could
find
somebody
whose
vacancy
had
actually
arisen
at
the
time.
but
this
is
the
cockeyed
way
of
going
about
the
instruments
of
the
constitution.
there
is
no
power
in
the
constitution
to
use
the
recess
appointments
clause
to
overcome
the
opposition
of
the
senate
to
the
president's
nominees.
and
for
all
that
we
hear
about
today,
which
has
to
do
with
how
the
heaven
will
fall,
and
the
parade
of
horribles,
there
is
no
parade,
and
there
is
no
horrible.
the
only
thing
that
will
happen
is
that
the
president,
heaven
help
us,
will
be
forced
to
comply
with
the
advice
and
consent
that
the
appointments
power
--
excuse
me
--
the
appointments
clause
actually
calls
for.
that
was
not
viewed
as
an
evil
by
the
framers.
that
was
what
the
framers
unanimously
agreed
was
going
to
be
the
principal
means
for
appointments
for
the
principal
officers
of
the
union.
mr.
miguel
estrada
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
a
very
interesting
and
somewhat
difficult
question.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
a
substantial
question,
which
no
one
really
has
litigated,
as
to
whether
there
was,
in
fact,
an
inter-session
recess,
whether
the
first
session
of
the
112th
congress
ended
on
the
morning
of
january
3rd
and
therefore,
we
have
the
same
teddy
roosevelt
situation,
or
whether
by
adjourning
on
december
30th
and
contemplating
no
further
meetings
until
january
3rd,
whether
that
in
effect
--
in
effect
was
a
sine
die
adjournment
that
ended
the
first
session
of
the
congress.
if
the
president
had
the
same
view
about
the
nature
of
the
pro
forma
sessions,
he
could
have
taken
the
view
about
the
sessions
between
december
17th
and
january
3rd
and
could
have
had
a
better
legal
argument
in
attempting
to
claim
that
between
december
30th
and
january
3rd,
there
was
at
least
an
arguable
inter-session
recess.
and
he
did
not
do
that.
why
didn't
he?
because
by
waiting
until
the
convening
of
the
first
session
--
of
the
second
session
of
the
112th
congress,
by
making
an
appointment
on
january
4th
instead
of
the
morning
of
january
3rd,
he
gives
an
extra
year
to
his
appointees
to
serve.
that
shows
that
this
is,
indeed,
the
bottom
of
the
slippery
slope
on
the
recess
appointments
clause.
it
is
a
complete
abuse
of
the
process.
it
is
being
used
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
overcome
the
senate
opposition
or
the
senate
disinclination
to
agree
with
the
president's
nominations.
what
the
framers
contemplated
in
coming
up
with
a
joint
power
of
appointment
was
you
have
to
act
jointly.
you
have
to
play
nice.
and
in
a
country
of
300
million
people,
when
the
president
wants
a
nominee
and
the
senate
does
not
agree,
it
is
always
possible
for
the
president
to
come
up
with
another
nominee
who
is
even
more
qualified
and
acceptable
to
the
senate.
the
key
here
is
acceptable
to
the
senate.
he
has
to
be
able
to
proffer
someone
to
the
senate
that
the
senate
is
willing
to
engage
in
a
joint
power
of
appointment
for.
mr.
miguel
estrada
i
don't
think
so.
it
is
usually
the
case,
justice
sotomayor,
but
not
necessarily.
the
example
i
would
give--
mr.
miguel
estrada
--no,
i
don't--
mr.
miguel
estrada
--yes.
mr.
miguel
estrada
if
the
senate
has
been
recessed
without
days
so
that
the
session
of
the
senate
is
over,
even
if
the
president,
under
article
ii,
chooses
to
leave
the
house
in
session--
mr.
miguel
estrada
--this
takes
us
back
to
the
first
argument,
and
i
think
the
contemplation
was
that
the
recess
would
be
the
period
of
time
that
intervened
between
the
ending
of
a
session
of
the
congress
and
the
beginning
of
the
next.
here--
mr.
miguel
estrada
--well,
that
wasn't
true
until
the
20th
amendment.
you
know,
the
date
was
a
much
different
date
in
the
original
constitution.
but
to
answer
your
earlier
question,
it
is
usually
the
case
that
a
recess
is
going
to
be
longer
than
3
days,
but
it
needn't
be.
if
the
senate
finished
all
of
its
legislative
business,
for
example,
in
this
year
on
december
30,
2011,
and
then
voted
to
adjourn
sine
die,
and
did
not
again
meet
until
the
beginning
of
the
second
session
of
the
congress
on
january
3rd,
that
would
be
an
intra-session
recess
even
though
it
would
not
be
one
that
would
require
consent
of
the
house.
but
in
the
usual
case
in
which
a
recess
is
taken
for
an
extended
period
of
time,
it
would
be
the
type
of
break
that
the
framers
contemplated
would
need
the
consent
of
the
house.
and
the
reason
for
that
should
be
obvious.
we
have
a
system
of
a
bicameral
legislation.
the
houses
two
are
supposed
to
work
together
to
accomplish
the
business
of
the
people.
if
the
house
is
working
on
something
and
the
senate
wants
to
go
away,
or
visa-versa,
they
need
the
consent
of
each
other
because
they
may
need
each
other
to
frame
out
ongoing
legislative
projects.
and
if
the
house
in
its
own
judgment
thinks
that
the
senate
is
sufficiently
available
to
the
house
in
our
bicameral
system
so
that
it
--
so
that
has
been
is
full
compliance
with
the
adjournments
clause,
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
in
the
agreement
of
both
houses
of
congress
that
the
senate
is
in
fact
effectively
available,
that
is
there
with
its
full
power
of
unanimous
consent
every
third
day.
if
the
house
thinks
that
that
is
adequate
for
the
discharge
of
its
constitutional
functions
and
the
constitutional
functions
of
the
senate,
it's
very
difficult
to
see
how
the
president
gets
to
second-guess
that.
one
final
point
that
has
to
do
with
the
solicitor
general's
insistence
on
the
no-business
language.
rules
5.1
of
the
senate
--
may
i
finish?
mr.
miguel
estrada
--makes
very
clear
--
it's
also
in
our
appendix
--
that
any
business
may
conducted
--
be
conducted
at
any
time,
without
notice,
by
unanimous
consent.
and
so
that
effectively,
what
we
have
here
is
merely
an
announcement
by
the
senate
that
between
december
17th
and
january
23rd,
only
unanimous
consent
business
would
be
agreed
to.
