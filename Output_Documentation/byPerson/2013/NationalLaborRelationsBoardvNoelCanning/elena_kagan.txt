justice
elena
kagan
general,
i
think
you're
--
you're
not
answering
the
real
thrust
of
the
chief
justice's
question,
which
is
that
we
could
just
be
back
here
if
we
--
if
we
said,
well,
they
didn't
phrase
this
in
the
right
way.
well,
they'll
phrase
it
differently
and
we
would
be
back
here
with
the
same
essential
problem,
that
you're
asking
us
to
peg
this
on
a
formality
that
the
senate
could
easily
evade,
and
that
suggests
that
it
really
is
the
senate's
job
to
determine
whether
they're
in
recess
or
whether
they're
not.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
would
you
agree
that
this
clause
now
is
not
mostly
used
to
deal
with
emergencies
arising
from
congressional
absence?
that
most
modern
presidents
--
and
i
say
this
sort
of
going
--
going
back
to
president
reagan,
presidents
of
both
parties
essentially
have
used
this
clause
as
a
way
to
deal,
not
with
congressional
absence,
but
with
congressional
intransigence,
with
a
congress
that
simply
does
not
want
to
approve
appointments
that
the
president
thinks
ought
to
be
approved?
you
know,
absence
in
this
day
and
age
--
this
is
not
the
horse
and
buggy
era
anymore.
there's
no
real
--
there's
no
such
thing
truly
as
congressional
absence
anymore.
and
that
makes
me
wonder
whether
we're
dealing
here
with
what's
essentially
an
historic
relic,
something
whose
original
purpose
has
disappeared
and
has
assumed
a
new
purpose
that
nobody
ever
intended
it
to
have.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
as
a
result
of
congressional
refusal,
not
as
a
result
of
congressional
action.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
i
think
that's
a
really
strong
argument,
but
i
have
to
say
i'm
not
sure
it
applies
consistently
throughout
each
of
the
three
claims
that
you
make.
because
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
history
and
on
the
development
of
an
equilibrium
with
respect
to
what
“
happens
”
means,
and
if
you
are
going
to
do
that
again
with
respect
to
whether
intra-session
recesses
are
included,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
also
have
to
look
to
history
and
the
development
of
an
equilibrium
with
respect
to
congress's
definition
of
its
own
power
to
determine
whether
they
are
in
recess
or
not.
in
other
words,
your
third
argument
about
pro
forma
sessions,
the
history
is
entirely
on
the
senate's
side,
not
on
your
side.
and
if
we're
going
to
take
a
kind
of
continuing
practice
and
the
development
of
equilibrium
seriously,
you
might
win
on
questions
1
and
2
and
then
lose
on
question
3.
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
it
was
--
suppose
it
was
the
exact
same
no-business
order,
but
the
single
senator
who
was
there
got
up
and
asked
for
unanimous
consent
to
name
a
post
office,
and
every
three
days,
he
got
up
and
said
unanimous
consent
to
name
a
post
office.
the
post
office
is
named.
so
they
can
do,
you
know,
trivial
business
in
each
of
these
sessions.
would
that
make
a
constitutional
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that,
again,
suggests
that
the
rule
that
you're
asking
us
to
establish
is
--
is
so
easy
to
evade
that
why
bother
establishing
it
at
all.
the
fact
that
it's
so
easy
to
evade
suggests
that
this
really
is
--
the
question
of
how
to
define
a
recess
really
does
belong
to
the
senate.
justice
elena
kagan
i
totally
take
your
point
on
that.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
they
can
just
come
back,
and
by
naming
post
offices,
have
the
same
effect,
that
they
would
write
it
out
of
the
--
of
the
constitution
as
much
as
you
say
this
does.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
francisco,
i'm
sorry,
but
could
we
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
because
i
really
have
the
same
issue
with
your
argument.
you
know,
suppose
that
on
one
--
let's
say
the
“
happens
”
argument,
that
yours
is
at
least
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statute,
at
least
the
way
we
understand
the
word
“
happen
”
today,
and
maybe
a
compelled
reading,
but
the
history
points
so
much
in
the
other
direction;
and
that
that
history
brings
with
it
a
whole
set
of
practices
and
traditions
and
ways
of
dealing
with
each
other
that
has
grown
around
a
certain
interpretation
of
what
“
happens
”
means,
right?
the
idea
that
we
would
wake
up
one
fine
morning
and
chuck
all
of
that
because
all
of
a
sudden
we
happened
to
read
the
clause,
i
mean,
that
at
least
needs
to
be
defended.
justice
elena
kagan
i
know,
but
now,
you're
--
you're
again
--
i
mean,
assume
that
there
is
a
200-year-old
established
practice,
everybody
has
agreed
to
it,
but
the
text,
when
you
really
look
at
it,
points
the
other
way.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
francisco,
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
about
this,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
intra-session
recesses
really
only
arose
in
the
1940s
or
so,
right?
there
is
the
period
with
andrew
johnson
and
andrew
johnson
used
intra-recess
--
intra-session
recesses
to
make
a
lot
of
appointments.
other
than
that,
intra-session
recesses
of
more
than
3
days
that
are
not
christmas
simply
do
not
exist.
so
that
assume
that
as
intra-session
recesses
came
to
be
presidents
started
making
appointments
in
them.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
francisco,
can
i
ask
a
question
about
the
second
question
presented,
the
“
happens
”
question?
justice
elena
kagan
and
if
you
put
aside
all
the
history
and
you
look
only
at
the
language
and
you
look
only
at
our
own
modern
view
of
what
happens,
that
surely
seems
to
favor
your
position.
but
if,
you
know,
given
all
the
statements
in
the
founding
period
itself
about
how
this
is
ambiguous
and
it
might
have
two
meanings,
if
you
look
at
the
dictionaries
of
that
time
--
so
i
went
back
and
i
looked
at
the
oxford
english
dictionary,
and
one
of
the
definitions
of
“
happens
”
there
is
“
chance
to
be
”,
essentially
the
exact
same
definition
that
thomas
jefferson
said
made
this
ambiguous.
and
we
would
never
use
“
happens
”
in
that
way
now.
if
you
look
at
the
examples
that
the
oxford
english
gives,
they're
laughable.
nobody
would
ever
say
that
now.
but
it
just
suggested
to
me
that
maybe
what
we
think
is
pretty
clear
is
only
pretty
clear
because
one
meaning
of
happens
has,
you
know,
over
200
years--
justice
elena
kagan
--lapsed.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i
don't
think
so.
essentially,
thomas
jefferson
says
it
could
mean
one
thing
or
the
other,
and
the
other
thing
that
he
said,
which
is
“
happens
to
exist
”,
is
sort
of
exactly
this
old
definition,
which
is
“
happens
”
means
“
chance
to
be
”.
justice
elena
kagan
you
know,
i
don't
remember
them
exactly.
i
just
remember
kind
of
laughing
at
them,
as
things
that--
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
--nobody
would
say--
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
estrada,
you
said
in
your
brief
that
that
was
true
within
wide
limits.
what
are
the
wide
limits?
justice
elena
kagan
is
the
chief
justice's
example
before,
if
the
senate
just
said,
we're
--
we're
never
in
recess
for
purposes
of
appointments,
would
that
be
permissible.
justice
elena
kagan
but
people
object
all
the
time
to
things
that
in
fact
they
can't
do
anything
about,
right?
