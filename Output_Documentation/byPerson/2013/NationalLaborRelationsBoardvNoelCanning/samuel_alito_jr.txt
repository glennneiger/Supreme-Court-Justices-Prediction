justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
the
premise.
a
vacancy
is
something
that
begins
at
a
particular
point
in
time
and
then
it
continues
for
some
period.
and
i
was
trying
to
think
of
some
other
things
that
might
fall
into
the
same
category.
one
would
be
an
appointment
to
a
federal
office.
so
you
were
appointed
as
solicitor
general
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
and
the
appointment
continues.
another
example
might
be
a
marriage.
it
happens
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
and
it
continues
for
a
--
a
period
of
time.
now,
would
we
say
that
your
appointment
as
solicitor
general
is
happening
today
and
will
happen
again
tomorrow
and
happened
yesterday?
is
that
the
way
the
english
language
is
used?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
are
making
a
very,
very
aggressive
argument
in
favor
of
executive
power
now
and
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
the
senate
is
in
session
or
not.
you're
just
saying
when
the
senate
acts,
in
your
view,
irresponsibly
and
refuses
to
confirm
nominations,
then
the
president
must
be
able
to
fill
those
--
fill
those
positions.
that's
what
you're
arguing.
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
whether
the
senate
is
in
session.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there's
no
practice
--
there
is
no
long
practice
of
doing
it.
there
is
also
no
long
practice
of
rejecting
it.
but
if
i
could
take
you
back
to
that,
you
said
that
the
pro
forma
sessions
may
violate
the
adjournment
clause
in
the
twentieth
amendment.
would
you
also
say
that
they
violate
the
presentment
clause,
because
the
senate
has
passed
legislation
during
these
pro
forma
sessions
and
the
president
has
signed
that
legislation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
where
does
this
3-day
rule--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
what
is
significant
is
whether
they're
available
to
confirm
nominees;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
suppose
they
say,
instead
of
no
business
will
be
conducted,
no
nominations
will
be
considered.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
know
it
would
be
a
different
case,
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--so
what?
the
point
of
the
question
is
whether
they're
available
to
consider
nominations.
so
if
they
say,
we'll
do
other
business,
but
no
nominations
will
be
considered,
why
isn't
it
exactly
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
recess
appointments
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
variant
of
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
general
verrilli.
suppose
we
think
that
the
language
in
the
constitution
is
perfectly
clear
in
some
respect,
but
that
there
is
a
200-year-old
consistent
practice,
agreement
by
the
president,
going
back
to
washington
and
by
the
senate
that
the
language
actually
means
something
else.
what
would
we
do
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
first
question,
does
your
argument
depend
on
the
fact
that
--
on
the
assumption
that
the
--
the
possibility
of
a
lengthy
intra-session
break
was
never
even
contemplated
by
those
who
framed
and
--
and
ratified
the
constitution?
because
if
they
had
thought
about
that,
there's
a
real
chance
the
senate
may
take
a
two-month
break--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--over
christmas.
would
there
be
any
reason
why
they
wouldn't
have
wanted
the
recess
appointment
power
to
apply
there
as
well
as
at
the
end
of
the
session?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
answer.
if
the
purpose
is
to
permit
the
president
to
fill
vacancies
when
the
senate
is
unavailable
to
consider
nominations
and
the
country
would
be
harmed
by
having
these
offices
vacant
for
a
period
of
time,
why
would
that
not
apply
to
any
lengthy
break,
whether
it's
at
the
end
of
the
session
or
in
the
middle
of
the
session?
and
so
if
you're
arguing
that
it
only
applies
at
the
end
of
the
session,
doesn't
that
depend
on
the
assumption
that
they
never
thought
about
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
lengthy
break
in
the
middle
of
the
session?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
first
question,
then
there
either
needs
to
either
be
a
number
or
a
functional
test.
and
i
don't
know
where
the
number
would
come
from
and
i
don't
know
how
the
functional
test
would
play
out,
so
maybe
you
could
say
just
a
word
about
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
presence
of
that
in
the
adjournments
clause
but
the
absence
of
any
number
in
the
recess
appointments
clause,
how
do
you
explain
that?
