justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
you
say
about
the
twentieth
amendment,
which
says
that
that
january
3rd
was
a
meeting?
are
you
saying
they
violated
the
twentieth
amendment?
january
3rd.
this
says
the
congress
of
the
united
states
shall
meet
on
january
3rd
every
year,
unless
they
appoint
a
different
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
haven't.
and,
therefore,
they
met
in
pro
forma
session.
or
do
you
think
it
wasn't
a
meeting?
and
what
do
you
think
about
the
other
part
of
the
constitution
which
says
they
can't
adjourn
for
more
than
3
days
without
the
approval
of
the
house,
which
they
didn't
have.
so
are
you
saying
that
the
senate
violated
those
other
two
amendments
of
--
the
two
parts
of
the
constitution,
or
are
you
saying
that
they
have
different
meanings
in
the
three
parts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
you're
saying
they
violated.
but
if
that
--
if
they
have
pro
forma
sessions
on
january
3rd,
they
violate
the
twentieth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
you
are
saying
that
if
they
had
a
pro
forma
session
on
january
3rd,
that
since
their
meeting
--
their
recess
was
still
on
and
lasted
more
than
3
days,
it
was
a
violation
of
that
adjournment
clause
of
the
constitution.
now,
that's
one
way
to
interpret
it.
over
a
long
period
of
time,
they
have
apparently
met
pro
forma
on
those
days.
or
we
could
try
to
make
them
mean
the
same
thing,
which
would
mean
it
was
up
to
the
senate.
they
consider
that
a
meeting,
it's
a
meeting.
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
write
that
opinion,
saying
the
senate
of
the
united
states
has
violated
two
--
two
provisions
of
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
--
would
it
--
i
mean,
that's
my
basic
question
really.
why
is
this
an
important
case?
i
see
what
you're
saying
on
this
one.
that's
fine
for
an
answer.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
my
really
basic
question
is
why
is
this
an
important
case,
in
your
opinion?
now,
you've
said,
oh,
because
there
are
thousands
of
recess
appointments.
not
on
the
happen
clause.
you've
listed
7600
or
so,
really,
on
the
recess
part,
but
on
the
happen
clause,
you've
only
been
able
to
find
102.
and
moreover,
we've
had
an
example
of
--
where
this
court,
for
better
or
for
worse,
said
that
two
members
of
the
board
is
not
a
quorum,
and
we
got
some
more
members,
they
dealt
with
the
problem.
they
ratified
all
those
opinions,
they
dealt
with
it.
it
didn't
take
them
too
much
time.
so
--
and
we
have
different
political
parties
taking
absolutely
opposite
sides,
it
seems
to
me,
or
some
members
thereof,
depending
on
the
political
party
of
the
president.
and
we
have
a
clause
that
had
to
do
with
the
constitution
and
the
problem
of
intra
--
inter-session
recesses
when
they
were
7
months
and
nobody
could
meet.
okay,
that
isn't
true
anymore.
so,
explain
to
me.
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
i
just
want
to
hear
from
your
mouth
why
this
is
an
important
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
most
surprising
thing
to
me
that
you
have
said,
and
it's
important,
is
not
just
the
view
of
language
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
but
what
the
purpose
of
this
clause
was.
i
mean,
this
is
a
very
well-briefed
case,
and
i
have
looked
at
them.
i
have
read
them,
actually.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
cannot
find
anything,
so
far,
and
i
may
have
missed
it
--
i'm
asking
--
i
can't
find
anything
that
says
the
purpose
of
this
clause
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
political
fights
between
congress
and
the
president.
to
the
contrary,
hamilton
says
that
the
way
we're
going
to
appoint
people
in
this
country
is
congress
and
the
president
have
to
agree.
now,
that's
a
political
problem,
not
a
constitutional
problem,
that
agreement.
and
it
was
just
as
much
true
of
president
george
bush,
who
made
six
appointments
that
happened
previously,
as
it
is
with
president
obama,
who's
made
four.
all
right?
so
--
so
where
--
and
he
says
this
clause
is
a
supplement,
a
supplement,
to
the
basic
clause
to
take
care
of
the
timing
problem.
so,
what
have
i
missed?
where
is
it
in
the
history
of
this
clause,
in
its
origination,
that
it
has
as
a
purpose
to
allow
the
president
to
try
to
overcome
political
disagreement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
isn't
a
purpose,
can
you
give
me
an
example
where
the
language,
particularly
that
word
“
happen
”
--
i
mean,
your
example
is
a
good
one
but
i
don't
think
it
applies,
but
that's
a
different
matter.
i
can't
--
the
language
is
over
here.
the
number
of
appointments
on
“
happen
”
is
few.
if
you
are
worried
about
james
tobin,
congress
has
passed
a
law
that
can
be
taken
as
looking
at
a
vacancy
occurring
when
it
occurs
within
30
days
of
the
beginning
of
the
recess,
which
would
have
taken
care
of
tobin.
so
look
at
the
language
difficulty.
look
at
the
comparatively
small
practice
in
that
area.
look
at
the
other
ways
to
get
around
the
problem,
and
then
give
me
another
example
in
the
constitution
where
you
have
both
language
and
purpose
pointing
one
place
and
yet
this
court
because
of
practice
has
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
“
happen
”?
of
course
battles
happen.
that's
because
battles
occur
over
time.
give
me
an
example
with
the
word
“
vacancy
”,
where
that
word
“
vacancy
”
is
used
with
the
word
“
is
”
but
not
“
occurred
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
just
give
me
an
english
example
from
its
natural--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
statutory
example
has
to
do
with
a
battle,
not
a
vacancy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
financial
emergency,
correct.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
asking
you
for
an
example
with
the
word
“
vacancy
”.
that's
what
i
am
having
trouble
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i
just
say,
could
you
find
an
example,
and
i'm
gathering
from
my
answer
you
couldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
i
couldn't
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
reason
they
could
have
put
the
language
in
is
because
they
were
afraid
otherwise
the
president
would
have
the
power,
simply,
when
somebody
died
two
or
three
years
before
and
they've
had
a
big
fight
in
congress
to
save
up
all
the
controversial
nominations
and
then
put
them
through
as
recess
appointments.
that
could
be
one
thing
they
didn't
want
to
happen.
i
don't
know.
you
see,
it's
the
same
problem.
same
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happened
in
that
period
at
around
1970
is
that's
about
the
first
time
that
you
have
intra-session
--
an
intra-session
recess
that's
longer
than
an
inter-session
recess.
and
so
now
if
we
look
from
1970
on,
that's
fairly
common.
and
so
all
that's
happening
is
that
the
presidents
are
appointing
recess
appointees
during
periods
where
they
are
out
for
a
longer
time.
now,
how
are
we
supposed
to
go
and
say
that
this
thing
--
thousands
of
people
on
the
recess
part
--
is
unconstitutional?
i
mean,
it
isn't
unheard
of.
what
about
the
due
process
clause?
does
that
easily
cover
the
language?
substantive
due
process?
what
about
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
the
doctrine
of,
you
know,
the
implicit
clause
there?
i
mean,
it
isn't
unheard
of
that
over
time
language
in
the
constitution
takes
on
a
somewhat
different
meaning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
--
i
mean,
probably
different
judges
have
different
approaches.
but
if
i'm
concerned
about
the
basic
practicality
and
the
basic
objective
here,
why
would
i
agree
with
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
i
do
place
more
weight
on
this?
should
we
--
i
mean,
i
do
believe
and
agree
with
you
on
this
point
that
this
is
basically
a
matter
of
politics
for
other
branches
basically.
that
doesn't
help
me
resolve
this.
but
it
does
lead
over
to
this
possibility.
congress
did
pass
the
no
pay
act.
then
it
passed
the
pay
act.
and
in
that
pay
act
on
this
“
happen
”
part,
which
i
think
is
the
strongest
--
very
strong
for
your
side,
but
it
defines
the
vacancy
in
terms
of
30
days
prior
to
the
recess.
that
would
take
care
of
most
of
these.
you
see,
if
vacancy
could
be
defined
as
something
that
stretches,
because
congress
says
it
stretches
in
terms
of
pay
for
30
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
of
that?
and
i
would
love
to
know
what
the
sg
thinks
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
third
question,
by
the
way,
and
i
just
put
in
your
mind,
if
you
digress
in
your
answer,
put
in
your
mind
what
would
have
happened
in
1830
if
someone,
when
they
had
a
9-month
recess,
close
to
10
months,
someone
had
the
bright
idea,
well,
you
live
near
washington;
go
show
up
at
wherever
we
are
holding
our
sessions
and
sit
there
for
5
minutes,
and
we'll
stop
president
andrew
jackson
from
making
recess
appointments.
what
would
we
be
saying
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually,
i
think
i
remember
what
they
were--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
they
were
1483
and
1490-something,
and
then
there
was
an
asterisk
that
said
“
obsolete
”.
[laughter]
and
in
fact
--
in
fact,
i
couldn't
figure
out
what
they
were
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
say
anything
before
the
--
about
the
--
the
language
on
the
“
happen
”,
i
support
you.
but
the
--
the
practice,
and
in
particular,
the
practicalities,
because
you
say,
well,
the
president
can
make
an
acting
appointment,
make
a
recess
appointment
even.
i
mean,
you
know,
they
have
much
less
authority,
somebody
appointed
in
that
way,
much
less
than
a
person
who's
been
confirmed
by
the
senate.
so
if
the
government
won't
grind
to
a
halt,
it
still
faces
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
end
of
it,
exactly
the
same,
if
this
all
took
place
during
the
9-month
inter-session
recess
in
1835.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
exactly,
same
facts.
same
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
therefore,
in
your
view,
the
clause,
even
if
they
were
all
scattered
to
the
winds
in
1835,
there
would
have
been
not
possible
for
president
andrew
jackson,
if
i
have
that
right,
to
make
the
recess
appointments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
your
view
would
be
that
the
court
should
reject
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
say
anything
that
would
--
on
this,
if
you
want
to,
that
would
turn
it
back
to
the
practicalities.
imagine,
hypothetically,
that
i
would
have
thought
president
theodore
roosevelt
acted
unconstitutionally
when
he
tried
to
make
all
of
his
appointments,
dozens
and
dozens,
during
a
two-second--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
yes
--
inter-session--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
by
converse
reasoning,
the
congress
would
not
have
been
able,
in
1835,
to
prevent
recess
appointments
simply
by
having
a
nearby
senator
show
up
for
a
--
for
one
second,
once
every
3
days,
over
a
9-month
period.
it
seems
to
me
what
goes
around
comes
around
in
this
--
in
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
of
reports.
there
were
reports,
remember?
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
your
six
minutes
couldn't
be
up
already.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
i'm
focusing
on
30
days
and
the
reason
i'm
doing
that
is
this
seems
to
me,
hypothetically
at
least,
a
real
matter
for
the
political
branches
to
resolve
among
themselves.
now,
we
have
to
decide
this,
so
i
thought,
well,
why
not
look
and
see
what
congress
objects
to
the
least?
and
i
got
that
30-day
thing
from
the
pay
act
by
analogy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
want
to
get
your
view
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
really
interested
in
how
you
think
the
30-day
idea,
if
practical,
plays
out
in
terms
of
your
concerns.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
briefly.
