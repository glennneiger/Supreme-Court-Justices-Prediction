justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
--
that
i
follow
that
completely.
when
i
look
at
the
list
of
items
mentioned
in
the
statute
--
reservation,
post,
fort,
arsenal,
yard,
station,
or
installation
--
i
don't
think
of
command
separate
from
operational
control
or
being
run
by
and
used
by
the
military.
each
of
those
terms
has
an
operational
quality
to
it
that
mere
ownership,
which
i
equate
with
command,
doesn't.
it
makes
no
sense,
in
answer
to
justice
alito's
question,
to
say
you
need
notice,
unless
that
facility
has
a
military
flavor
to
it
that
someone
could
know
about.
and
you
talk
about
this
particular
camp,
but
you've
got
a
whole
green
line
around
it
to
tell
people
which
sections
you
are
actually
considering
the
camp,
and
he
was
found
outside
of
that
green
area.
you've
got
a
public
school,
a
public
highway.
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
you
can
keep
a
person
off
of
lands
that
the
military
is
not
using
in
its
operations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
close
down
--
you
close
down
roads
for
parades.
you
close
down
areas
for
other
public
needs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
couldn't
go
to
the
public
school,
though?
or
the
stores
or
any
other
facilities
that
the
public's
invited
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
such
an
odd
thing
for
a
class
b
misdemeanor
to
be
used
to
protect
the
national
security;
that
congress
has
determined
that
the
threat
is
so
great,
that
the
only
thing
you
need
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor
to
protect
the
u.s.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--there
are
some
pretty
severe
ones.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
are
you
buying
into
the
real
property
being
the
definition
here
at
all?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
read
the
--
the
other
definitions
of
the
statute,
i
keep
going
back
to
that
it's
a
function
analysis
and
not
a
real
property
analysis
because
that
would
answer
why
this
particular
electrical
meter
reading
--
that
area
still
being
operated
by
the
military
for
a
military
function,
that's
what
forts
do,
reservations,
yards,
i
don't
know
why
we
would
read
installation
any
differently.
but
you're
buying
into
this
real
property
as
being
the
defining
term.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i
have
the
same
problem
that
justice
breyer
has.
pxes
belong
to
the
military,
generally,
the
land,
but
they
are
run
by
outside
contractors,
sometimes.
are
you
saying
because
they've
given
up
exclusive
control
of
the
px,
that
they
fail
your
test?
so
does
the
utility
company.
i
don't
know
if
it's
possible
that
military
bases
generate
their
own
utilities,
but
i
presume
that,
somewhere,
they
don't,
and
they
have
an
easement
to
drive
up
and
read
their
meters.
there
may
be
easements
for
repairs
of
certain
underground
things
that
--
that
supply
the
base.
that's
not
exclusive
control,
so
i'm
--
or
possession.
so
what
--
what
does
your
test
mean?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
--
that
road
for
the
public
utility
for
which
there
is
an
easement
of
travel
is
not
exclusive
to
the
u.s.?
so
anybody
can
travel
into
the
base
at
any
time
they
want
to?
