justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
--
it
is
in
the
air
force
manual
and
in
a
jag
opinion,
was
the
exclusive
possession
criterion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
--
since
this
case
has
been
pending
quite
a
while,
has
the
manual
changed,
has
--
to
--
to
delete
the
exclusive
possession?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
--
if
your
position
is
right,
and
i
--
i
think
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
flowers,
because
flowers,
the
government
owned
that
area
as
well.
is
there
anything
left
--
i
mean,
that
--
in
this
case,
the
--
the
property
is
used
as
a
public
highway,
and
people
go
back
and
forth.
in
flowers,
it
was
a
street.
so
are
you
urging
that
flowers
is
essentially
overruled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
is
this?
where
is
the
exception?
is
it
--
was
it
in
the
bar
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
have
said
--
it
could
have
said
that
apel
can't
use
the
highway.
that
would
--
that
dispensation
was
a
matter
of
grace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
flower
--
flower
was
with
the
street.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
flowers
point,
i
think
mr.
horwich
said
that
--
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
1382
applied.
it
was
only
a
constitutional
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
flowers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
but
the
barment
order
that
mr.
horwich
just
read
to
us
says
that
he
can
use
the
road,
but
that's
not
--
because
the
road
is
outside
the
statute,
that's
because
the
government,
as
a
matter
of
grace,
said
right
in
the
order,
right
in
the
bar
order,
you
can
use
the
road.
so
there's
a
sharp
difference.
the
government
says
the
road
is
under
military
control,
if
the
commander
so
chooses,
but
we're
going
to
let
him
use
the
road.
the
government
treats
the
--
the
domain
as
including
the
road,
as
including
this
protest
area.
