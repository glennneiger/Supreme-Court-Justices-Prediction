justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
no
sanctions
for
trespassing
upon
federal
property
that
is
not
a
military
base?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
assume
it
would
be
contrary
to
--
to
his
orders
to
permit
such
installations,
without
his
ability
to
control
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
by
issuing
debarment
orders.
he
has
no
authority
to
do
that,
does
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
respondent's
theory
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
argued
in
that
case
that
the
statute
didn't
apply,
and
that's
what
you're
arguing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
keep
sliding
into
the
first
amendment
issue,
which
is
not
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
certiorari.
we're
only
interested
in
whether
the
statute
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
raise
it,
but
we
don't
have
to
listen
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
say
control
begins
at
the
green
light.
to
the
contrary,
they
say
they
have
control
over
the
whole
installation.
do
you
deny
that,
that
the
--
that
the
commanding
officer
has
the
right
to
control
the
entire
installation?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
--
because
the
commanding
officer
agreed
to
that,
because
that's
the
term
of
the
--
of
the
easement.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
well
be,
but
is
there
--
is
there
a
difference
in
the
authority
of
the
commanding
officer?
that's
what's
crucial.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
entitled
to
have
it
both
ways.
it's
their
base.
and
if
that's
the
deal
--
you
know,
take
it
or
leave
it,
state.
we
--
we'll
give
you
this
easement,
but
the
--
the
terms
are
what
we
have
said.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
--
if
your
colleague
is
correct,
that
the
green
line
marked
the
edge
of
the
easement,
it
would
be
entirely
proper
not
to
--
not
to
arrest
him
for
violating
the
base
until
he
left
the
easement;
that
is,
when
he
crossed
the
green
line.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
commanding
officer
saying
this
is
the
only
part
of
the
installation
that
we
care
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
marks
the
end
of
the
easement.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
back
to
the
real
estate
test.
i
--
i
thought
that
you
were
not
relying
on
the
--
on
the
exclusive
ownership
test.
you
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
defending
the
ninth
circuit's?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
about
the
portion
of
the
base
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
easement,
where
the
government
does
have
exclusive
possession?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
okay?
that's
still
part
of
the
base.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no,
under
your
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
very
bad,
but
is
it
bad
because
the
government
does
not
have
exclusive
possession
of
every--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
when
you
talk
about
the
road,
they've
given
an
easement,
so
you
can
say,
oh,
yeah,
they
don't
have
exclusive
possession.
but
the
other
side
of
the
road,
that
vast
tract,
you
are
saying
the
government,
what,
does
or
does
not
have
exclusive
possession?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
word
“
possession
”
means
nothing.
you
are
--
you
are
applying
solely
a
functional
test.
it
only
possesses
that
which
it
is
using
for
military
purposes.
that
is
not
a
possession
test.
it's
a
purely
functional
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
a
first
amendment
argument
and
not
an
argument
that
goes
to
the
scope
of
section
1382.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
saying
we
should
read
the
statute
to
say
it
only
applies
when
it
doesn't
violate
the
first
amendment.
of
course
we'd
read
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
because
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
scope
of
authority
of
the
government.
it's
what
the
government
can
do.
i
--
i
don't
know
how
to
read
that,
that
text,
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
avoid
all
first
amendment
problems.
there
is
no
way
to
do
that.
