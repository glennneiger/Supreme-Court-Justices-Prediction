mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
the
right
to
peacefully
protest
on
a
fully
open
public
road,
in
a
designated
protest
zone.
for
decades,
every
lower
federal
court,
and,
for
that
matter,
the
united
states
itself,
interpreted
18
united
states
code
section
1382
to
apply
only
if
there's
exclusive
federal
possession.
any
other
interpretation
would
raise
grave
first
amendment
issues.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
this
court's
prior
holding
in
flower
v.
united
states.
flower
involved
a
street
that
was
on
a
military
base.
it
involved
an
individual,
john
flower,
who
was
subjected
to
a
bar
order--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
there
are
two
arguments
here.
one
is
that
1832
--
1382
does
not
apply
because
military
installation
requires
exclusive
possession.
the
second
argument--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
correct.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
there's
no
dispute
in
flower
that
1382
would
apply
because
it
was
a
street
within
the
military
base.
but
to
go
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
this
court
in
albertini
was
very
clear
that
what
flower
means
is
that,
when
there
is
a
fully
open
public
route,
there
is
a
right
to
use
it
for
speech
activities.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes.
in
terms
of
the
easement,
when
an
easement
goes
towards
a
public
road,
that
easement
includes
the
right
to
use
the
public
road
for
speech
activities.
you're
right,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
in
paragraph--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--paragraph
4
says
that
there
can
be
rules
and
regulations
with
regard
to
the
easement.
your
honor,
those
rules
and
regulations
must
be
consistent
with
the
constitution.
for
example,
the
commander
couldn't
exclude
african
americans
from
that
road.
and
that's
why
the--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
in
interpreting
the
statute,
it
must
be
done
so
as
to
avoid
constitutional
doubts.
that's
why
the
first
amendment
comes
up.
also,
of
course,
as
this
court
repeatedly
has
held,
respondent
can
raise
any
issue
that
was
raised
below
to
defend
the
judgment,
which
is
also
why
the
first
amendment
is
here.
but
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--of
course,
that's
right.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course,
your
honor,
and
i
will
address
the
meaning
then
of
“
military
installation
”.
yes,
justice
breyer?
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
the
question
is
what
does
the
phrase
“
military
installation
”
mean?
one
way
of
defining
it
would
be
all
of
the
property
that's
owned
by
the
united
states.
but
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
the
united
states
rejects
that
interpretation
in
footnote
1
of
its
reply
brief.
the
alternative
interpretation
is
exclusive
possession,
and
that's
the
one
that
all
of
the
lower
courts--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
we
would
not
take
that
position.
we
would--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
right.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
and
i
think
that's
exactly
justice
kennedy's
question
of
the
difference
between
an
easement
for
a
public
road
and
the
easement
for
your
backyard
or
the
easement
for
a
utility,
and
that's
why
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
aspect
of
this
case
can
be
separated
from
the
statutory
aspect.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
i
completely
agree
with
what
you
just
said.
i
think
it
is
a
functional
analysis.
here,
the
military
has
built
a
fence
perimeter
around
vandenberg.
they
have
drawn
a
green
line
where
they
said
that
the
control
begins.
on
the
other
side
of
the
green
line
is
highway
1
that
anyone
can
drive
down.
there
are
no
signs
that
indicate
that
they're
part
of
the
military
base,
and
where
there's
a--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
authority
of
the
commanding
officer
within
the
close
confines
of
the
base
and
outside
the
base.
for
example,
civilians
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
what
they're
doing
on
that
public
road.
they're
under
the
memorandum
of
understanding
that
california
highway
patrol--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
will
go
back
to
what
justice
sotomayor
said.
there
is
a
functional
difference
between
the
public
road
and
the
designated
protest
zone.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
under
the
memorandum
of
understanding,
the
high
--
the
commanding
officer
has
ceded
control
over
that
public
road
to
the
highway
patrol
--
the
united
states
wants
it
both
ways.
they
want
the
benefits
of
having
an
easement
there,
in
the
sense
that
the
state
is
responsible
for
maintaining
the
road,
the
state
is
liable
for
any
harms
on
the
road,
the
state
enforces
crimes
on
the
road,
but
they
also
want
to
claim
that
they
have
all
of
the
control
over
that
public
road
as
they
would
within
the
base.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor,
they
shouldn't
have
it
both
ways.
once
they've
created
a
public
road,
once
they've
created
a
designated
protest
zone,
it
is
different,
functionally,
than
the
rest
of
the
base.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
sure.
we
know
that
the
united
states
treats
its
easement
as
--
its
control
as
beginning
within
the
green
line
area.
so,
for
example,
when
mr.
apel
crossed
the
green
line
previously,
that
was
the
place
at
which
he
was
convicted
for
trespassing.
in
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
both
our
briefs,
lines
on
the
road
were
taken
as
defining
the
area
where
military
jurisdiction
begins.
so
the
sixth
circuit's
mccoy
case,
it
was
a
white
line,
and
the
military
said,
once
somebody
crossed
the
white
line,
that's
where
section
1382
began.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
it's
not--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well,
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
the
green
line
is
taken
by
the
united
states
marking
the
end
of
the
easement.
and
the
united
states,
therefore,
can
enforce
1382,
once
mr.
apel
or
anybody
else
crosses
the
green
line.
but,
when
it
is
on
the
public
side
of
the
green
line,
on
that
public
road,
in
that
protest
area,
to
go
back
to
what
justice
sotomayor
said,
functionally--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
challenge
the
barment
order.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
in
both
of
the
instances
that
led
to
barment
orders,
he
crossed
that
green
line
that
was
on
the
military
base
side,
and
if
he
does
that,
then
1382
applies.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
road
and
the
area
within
the
green
line.
and
so
what
i
was
saying
to
justice
kagan
is
the
reason
why
the
barment
orders
were
permissible
is
he
crossed
the
green
line.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
correct.
1382
only
applies
to
that
which
is
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
united
states,
which
is
the
area
in
the
green
line.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
our
brief
very
much
doubts
the
exclusive
possession
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
though
i
do
believe,
as
justice
sotomayor
said,
there's
a
functional
reason
for
this.
it
is
the
difference
between
the
public
road
and
the
area
inside--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--we're
very
much
defending--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--and
i
think
the
functional
approach
that
justice
sotomayor
suggested
is
exactly
that.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
think,
here,
it
is
the
area
that
the
united
states
government
has
determined
by
where
it's
built
a
fence
and
drawn
the
green
line,
that
it
has
exclusive
possession.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no.
and,
in
fact,
that's
exactly
the
situation
here,
and
it
goes
to
answering
what
justice
breyer
began
a
moment
ago.
here,
what
you
have
is
a
fully
fenced
perimeter.
about
200
yards
from
that
fenced
perimeter,
where
there
is
a
gate,
a
green
line
was
drawn
on
the
ground.
on
just
the
other
side
of
that
green
line
is
a
designated
protest
zone
in
highway
1.
and
that's,
of
course,
where
these
activities
occurred.
and
what
i
was
saying
to
justice
breyer
is
there
are
reasons
why
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
this
has
adopted
the
exclusive
possession
tests.
it
serves
the
interest
of
the
public
in
giving
clear
notice
for
when
they're
on
a
military
base--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well,
the
fence
is
tremendously
relevant,
in
determining
where
the
government
believes
the
military
installation
begins,
and
also,
it's
very
important
in
terms
of
national
security.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
the
government
gets
to
decide
the
area
of
exclusive
possession.
so
take
the
greer
case
as
an
example.
in
greer,
this
case
emphasized
that
fort
dix,
even
though
it
was
open,
still
was
in
the
exclusive
possession.
in
fact,
the
first
paragraph
of
this
court's
opinion
in
greer
says,
“
exclusive
possession
”.
maybe
the
analogy
that
is
closest
to
this
case,
then,
is
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
grace,
where
this
court
drew
a
distinction
between
the
sidewalks
that
run
outside
this
building
and
the
building
itself.
and
the
court
said,
as
to
those
sidewalks,
even
though
they
abut
the
supreme
court,
it
still
is
open
for
speech
purposes.
sidewalks,
public
roads
are
inherently
open--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--obviously,
the
fence
is
significant,
in
terms
of
answering
the
government's
concerns
with
regard
to
national
security.
i
think
the
fence
is
also
important
to
go,
to
justice
sotomayor's
point,
with
regard
to
the
functional
approach.
my
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
what's
interesting,
as
was
pointed
out--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--the
government
does
not
have
not
exclusive
possession
there.
there
is
a
public
school
there,
for
example,
that
anyone
can
drive
and
go
to.
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
government's
interpretation
of
1382
is
that,
if
mr.
apel
had
a
child
attending
that
public
school,
he
could
not
go
pick
up
his
child
at
school,
but
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
could
drive--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
the
government
does
not
have
exclusive
possession.
the--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
congress
didn't,
in
1382,
say,
"all
land
owned
by
the
military.
"
it
used
the
phrase
“
military
installation
”,
and
whenever
that
phrase
has
been
defined,
it
always
refers
to
the
area
that
is
reserved
to
be
used
for
military
purposes.
the
united
states
can
draw
the
green
line
and
build
the
fence
wherever
it
chooses.
here,
it
decided
to
do
so
in
a
particular
place,
leaving
open
a
fully
open
public
road
with
a
designated
protest
zone.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
it
is
where
the
united
states
chooses
to
exercise
exclusive
possession.
the
united
states,
for
example,
in
greer,
said,
we
are
claiming
we
have
exclusive
possession
over
the
entire
area
of
fort
dix,
even
though
there
was
a
public
road.
if
the
government
wants
to
say,
even
as
to
the
px
within
vandenberg,
that's
within
our
exclusive
possession,
it
can
do
so.
but
the
government,
by
granting
the
easement,
by
allowing
the
public
road,
by
creating
the
designated
protest
zone,
has
done
something
very
different
than
exclusive
possession.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
because
in
order
to
come
on
to
that
utility
easement,
you
would
need
the
express
permission
of
the
base
commander.
so
that
utility
easement
would
still
be
an
exclusive
control,
to
go
to
justice
breyer's
question.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
your
honor,
everyone
has
the
authority
to
drive
down
that
road.
somebody
who--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--exactly.
and
then
the
question
is
once
the
united
states
has
ceded
the
easement,
under
1382
can
a
person
be
prosecuted?
and
once
the
united
states
has
ceded
that
easement,
does
it
violate
the
first
amendment
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
flower
to
prosecute--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--and
this
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
question
earlier
if
we
are
talking
about
an
easement.
an
easement
that
is
created
for
a
public
road
inherently
has
free
speech
rights
attached
to
it.
in
fact,
many
lower
court
cases
have
always
said
an
easement
for
a
public
road
includes
the
right
to
use
it
for
speech
purposes.
that
is
very
different
than
an
easement
that
exists
for
purposes
of
a
utility.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
because
you
need
to
interpret
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issues.
if
you
interpret
the
statute
to
allow
excluding
speech
on
this
public
road
easement
in
the
designated
protest
zone,
then
interpreting
the
statute
that
way
would
raise
grave
first
amendment
issues.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course,
you
should
read
it
that
way.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
reason
that
every
lower
court
and
the
united
states
government
itself
have
read
“
military
installation
”
as
exclusive
possession
is
that
otherwise
it
would
raise
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
my
position.
if
the
government
wanted
to
have
a
closed
base
and
say,
we're
going
to
allow
this
road
to
go
through,
but
there
were
signs
to
let
everyone
know
they
were
still
on
the
closed
base,
there
were
guards
that
were
there,
that
is
greer.
that
is
not
this
case,
and
that's
not
flower.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
in
a
sense,
yes,
your
honor.
the
sense
is
that
the
government
gets
to
decide
where
to
draw
the
green
line.
the
government
gets
to
decide
where
to
put
the
fence.
and
when
they
decided
to
create
a
public
road
with
a
protest
zone
outside
of
it,
then
to
interpret
1382
applied,
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
what's
wrong
with
that
is
there
is
no
need
to
exclude
peaceful
protesters
from
the
public
road
in
a
protest
zone
in
order
to
achieve
the
national
security
interest
of
the
government.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
military
commander
gets
to
decide
that.
but
by
creating
a
designated
protest
zone
outside
of
that,
it's
indicative
that
the
military
commander
doesn't
perceive
any
national
security
threat
from
allowing
a
gathering
there.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
but
we
--
this
court
has
never
said
there's
a
permanent
forfeiture
of
first
amendment
rights
because
somebody
misbehaved
at
one
time.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course
there
can
be.
people
can
be
in
prison
and
lose
their
first
amendment
rights.
there
can
be
restraining
orders
issued.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
he
can
be
barred
from
coming
onto
the
base,
as
drawn
by
the
green
line,
for
one
year
of--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
a
sentence
could
include
that.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
could
be,
or
if
somebody
was
perceived--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
the
ability
to
appeal
a
bar
order
to
the
commander.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
he
can
ask
the
commander
of
the
base
who
issued
the
bar
order
for
permission
to
use
it.
your
honors--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
they're
also
relevant
to
the
statute.
they're
relevant
to
interpret
the
statute
to
avoid
constitutional
doubt.
they're
relevant
because--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor.
and,
your
honor,
also,
since
every
other
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
as
we're
suggesting,
there's
at
least
ambiguity,
which
under
the
rule
of
lenity
means
it
has
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
a
criminal
defendant.
like
so
many
cases
to
come
before
you,
this
one
is
about
where
do
you
draw
the
line.
here
the
government
has
drawn
the
line
and
it's
a
green
line.
now,
on
this
side
of
the
green
line,
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
speak.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
1382
is
the
criminal
statute
that
he
was
convicted
of
violating.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
is
you
have
to
interpret
the
words
“
military
installation
”.
there
are
two
different
interpretations
or
perhaps
more
has
come
out.
what
we're
saying
is
you
have
to
choose
the
interpretation
that
favors
the
criminal
defendant.
so
we
are
using
the
rule
of
lenity
relative
to
interpreting
the
statute,
and
that's
why
we
believe
that
both
in
terms
of
the
statute
and
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment,
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
