mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1382
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
for
a
person
to
reenter
a
military
base
after
having
been
ordered
not
to
do
so
by
the
commanding
officer.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
here
added
another
requirement
for
conviction,
which
is
that
the
defendant
must
be
found
in
a
place
that,
as
a
matter
of
real
property
law,
is
within
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
united
states.
that
requirement
isn't
anywhere
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
no
court
has
ever
given
an
explanation
of
where
it
comes
from,
and
respondent
no
longer
defends
that
requirement.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
i
would
say
a
couple
things
about
those
sources,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
the
--
they
reflect,
essentially,
conservative
legal
advice
that
recognizes
that
some
courts
had
made
a
reference
to
such
a
requirement.
so
the
responsible
thing
to
do
if
you're
in
a
jag
rendering
an
opinion
on
what
the
right
way
to
structure
a
lease
is
or
whether
a
particular
place
is,
in
fact,
covered
by
1382
is
to
confirm
that,
yes,
this
would
meet
the
criteria
that
the
courts
have
established.
but
that
doesn't
--
certainly
doesn't
make
it
binding
on
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
--
the
u.s.
attorneys'
manual,
no.
it
hasn't
been
altered.
although
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
very
first
section
of
the
u.s.
attorneys'
manual
makes
clear
that
it
--
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
intended
to
create
rights,
it's
not
intended
to
bind
the
department
of
justice
or
otherwise
modify
the
meanings
of
criminal
statutes.
it's
simply
a
reference
guide.
and
it
is
a
reference
guide
that
certainly
would
be
accurate
in
some
circuits,
we
think
incorrect,
and
that's
what,
of
course,
this
court
is
now
in
a
position
to
resolve
the
disagreement
between
the
courts
on
that
--
on
that
subject.
so
what
respondent
does
argue
--
because,
of
course,
respondent
isn't
even
defending
that
requirement
here,
is
that
--
and
what
the
case
then
comes
down
to,
i
guess,
is
that
vandenberg
air
force
base
is
not
a
military
installation.
now,
we
think
it
is.
and
we
think
all
of
it
is.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
statute
refers
comprehensively
to
a
long
list
of
places,
reservation,
fort,
post,
arsenal,
yard,
station,
installation,
that
covers
the
range
of
places
that
are
subject
to
military
command.
and
vandenberg
is,
of
course,
a
place
that's
subject
to
military
command.
and
in
particular--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--military
command
is
a
question
of
lawful
authority.
what
might
be
thought
of,
in
a
civilian
context,
as
the
extent
of
the
commanding
officer's
jurisdiction.
and
so
what
--
the
way
things
are
set
up
is
that
the
civilian
leadership
in
the
department
of
defense
defines
spaces,
and
then
the
military
commanders
who
are
appointed
by
the
president,
then,
through
appointing
subordinate
commands,
will
have
units
assigned
to
particular
bases,
and
the
commanding
officer
of
the
unit
will
be
the
commanding
officer
of
the
base
to
which
the
unit
is
assigned.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it
--
it
would,
although
let
me
say
a
few
things
about
that.
your
description,
actually,
is
pretty
apt
as
to
vandenberg
itself.
it's
in
a
rural
area.
there
are
large
areas
of
what
you,
i
think,
accurately
described
as
open
fields,
that
are
there
precisely
to
serve
as
a
--
kind
of
a
buffer
zone
around
these
enormous
rocket
launches.
and
some
parts
of
it
are
particularly
posted;
other
parts
aren't.
we
do
think
that
there
would
--
that
a
defendant
needs
to
be
put
on
notice
in
some
--
in
some
respect.
we
refer
to
it,
i
think,
inartfully
in
our
brief
as
actually
that
the
defendant
would
have
knowledge.
i
think
it's
more
the
defendant
needs
to
be
on
notice.
and
like
ascertaining
the
extent
of
any
geographic
place,
the
place
to
look,
for
starters,
is
a
map.
and
if
you
look
at
a
--
nowadays,
you
go
on
the
internet
and
pull
up
any
map,
it
will
show
you
an
area
marked
off
as
vandenberg
air
force
base.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
yes.
we
don't
--
we're
not
suggesting
a
functional
test.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
the
coverage
of
1382
should
be
coextensive
with
the
commander's
authority,
which
is,
essentially,
as
i
sort
of
suggested,
in
the
nature
of
a
jurisdictional
test.
where
does
the
commander's
regulatory
and
barment
authority
extend
to
as
a
matter
of
military
law?
it
should
be
backed
up
by
a
misdemeanor
sanction
in
1382.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
guess,
just
to
take
the
last
point
there,
i
would
disagree
with
the
premise
that
the
military
is
not
using
these
lands
in
their
operation.
i
mean,
to
take
--
to
take
one
example,
there
will
be
--
there's
a
launch
tomorrow
at
vandenberg,
and
the
other
highway
that's
kind
of
indistinguishable
from
highway
1,
for
these
purposes,
is
going
to
be
closed
down
because
it's
in
the
area
that's
dangerous
because
it's
in
the
potential
impact
zone--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--certainly.
but
i
would
be
clear
that
the
reason
that
is
being
closed
down
is
because
the
commanding
officer
at
vandenberg
has
determined
that
that
property,
which
is
owned
by
the
united
states,
is
placed
under
his
--
placed
under
his
authority
as
a
commanding
officer,
is
--
is
--
is
assigned
to
the
department
of
the
air
force
for
administration,
he
has
determined
that
his
military
needs
require
closing
that
--
that
part
on
that
day.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
precisely
so,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
--
precisely
so,
justice
kennedy.
and
i
think
that
gets
to
the
bigger
picture
point
here,
which
is
that
it
would
be
a
very
odd
result
to
say
that
a
--
that
a
military
commander
has
to
maximally
inconvenience
the
public
by
shutting
a
place
down
at
all
times
in
order
to
preserve
the
misdemeanor
sanction
that
backs
up
his
authority.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
not
at
all,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
i
think
flowers
is
supportive
of
our
position
here,
on
the
statutory
point,
precisely
because
the
court
thought
to
resolve
flower
on
the
constitutional
grounds.
and
there
was
no
question
there
that
it
was
covered
by
1382,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
is
--
that
it
could
be
described
as
a
public
street,
it
was
also
property
that
was
under
the
command
of
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
sam
houston
in
that
--
in
that
case.
and
so
the
court
went
to
the
constitutional
question.
i'm
happy
to
talk
here,
if
the
court
is
interested,
about
the
--
the
constitutional
differences
between
this
case
and
flower.
but
flower
does
--
does
strongly
imply
that
coverage
of
1382,
which
the
court
would
ordinarily
address
first
before
reaching
the
constitutional
question,
wasn't
in
doubt
there,
nor
was
it
in
doubt
in
any
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
under
1382,
each
of
which
has
involved
a
military
installation
that
is,
to
some
greater
or
lesser
extent,
in
some
places
or
other,
open
to
the
public.
so--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--so
his
--
the
terms
of
his
barment
order
and
the
ordinary
terms
on
which
barment
orders
are
issued
at
vandenberg
is
that
there's
an
exception
carved
out
for
him
to
traverse
along
the
easement,
which,
again,
is
in
the
nature
of
a
concession
to
public
convenience,
which
it
seems
quite
unfair
to
sort
of
--
to
say
that,
well,
the
military
has
wound
up
worse
off
by
trying
to
accommodate
its
--
trying
to
accommodate
itself,
to
the
extent
consistent
with
its
security
needs,
to
public
use
and
convenience.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
it's
on
page
64
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
it's
in
the
middle
of
paragraph
2
on
64.
it
says,
"effective
immediately,
you
are
ordered
not
to
enter
onto
vandenberg
air
force
base,
except
to
traverse.
"
meaning
to
travel
"to
or
from
lompoc
and
santa
maria
on
highway
1
and
to
and
from
lompoc
and
amtrak
surf
station
on
highway
246.
"
which
passes
through
vandenberg's
property.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
that's
--
that's
correct.
but,
of
course,
there's
a
reason
for
that,
which
is
that
he
has
been
individually
identified
as
posing
a
threat
to
the
order
and
security
of
the
base.
now,
we
would
point
out,
he
was
barred--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
it's
certainly
not
the
only
thing.
in
our
--
in
our
opening
brief,
we
have
a
footnote
that
runs
through
kind
of
the
hierarchy
of
sanctions
that
might
be--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--there
are
some
severe
ones.
so
we
think
of
this
as
being
sort
of
a
first
line
of
defense,
if
you
will.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
justice
scalia,
absolutely,
there
are.
there's
a
statute
like
that
for
the
national
park
service.
there's
a
statute
like
that
for
the
bureau
of
land
management.
there's
a
statute
like
that
for
the
--
for
the
forest
service.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think,
if
it's
still
under
the
formal
command
of
the
military
officer
and
the
military
officer
is
empowered
to
issue
regulations
and
issue
barments,
which
this
court
has
long
recognized
is
the
necessary
concomitant
of
the
functioning
of
a
military
installation,
then,
no,
it
continues--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--exactly--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
that's
exactly
right.
so,
for
example,
to
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
--
and,
justice
sotomayor,
you
referred
to
the
--
the
school
that
--
that
is
on
the
base.
there
are
couple
--
actually,
a
couple
of
schools
on
the
base.
one
of
them
is
leased
to
a
school
district,
but
it
is,
nonetheless,
still
subject
to
the
commander's
command
authority.
the
commander
does
respond
to
dangerous
weapons
or
drugs
being
brought
there.
and
that's
necessary.
it's
right--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--in
the
--
in
the
school
premises,
i
--
i
believe
--
i
don't
want
to
be
quite
certain
about
this,
but
i
believe
that
the
--
well,
certainly,
the
elementary
school
and
i
believe,
also,
the
middle
school
is
within
the
area
that
is
--
within
the
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it's
been
ceded
to
the
united
states.
so
the
--
the
proper
response
there
would
need
to
be
by
federal
law
enforcement.
crimes
would
be
prosecuted
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no.
if
--
if
we're
talking
about
an
area
that's
under
the
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
the
military
--
the
military
police
or
--
or
security
forces,
as
they're
now
--
as
they're
now
called,
are
not
empowered
to
make
arrests
in
that
formal
sense.
they
can
--
they
can
detain
so
that
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
empowered
to
make
arrests
can
then
respond.
so,
for
example,
if
you
have
more
common
things,
a
traffic
stop,
maybe,
on
one
of
the
roads
off
the
highway
or
something
like
that,
they
will
need
to
detain
and
wait
for
an
appropriate
--
an
appropriate
law
enforcement
official
to
respond.
so,
again,
there
is
somewhat
of
a
--
of
a
different
situation
obtains
on
the
highway,
because
there
--
there
is
authority
for
the
--
the
county
police,
the
county
sheriff,
for
example,
to
respond.
so
there's
--
there's
a
different
status
there.
but
that's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
let
me
bracket
off
the
amtrak
station
because
we
don't
think
the
amtrak
station
is
under
military
command,
and
i'll
--
i
can
explain
why.
in
the
other
places,
it's
often
the
case
that
the
first
response
will
be
by
the
security
forces
because
they
are
in
the
area,
and
they
will
be
patrolling.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
military.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
now,
they
will
detain--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
yes.
the
--
the
amtrak
station
i
should
say,
though,
is
--
is
different
because,
there,
the
station
and
the
tracks
that
actually
run
--
you
know,
to
and
from
the
station,
are
actually
on
a
narrow
strip
of
land
that
is
owned
in
fee
by
a
railroad.
it
is
--
it
is
not
owned
by
the
united
states.
it's
not
under
air
force
department
administration.
it's
not
part
of
the
military
commander's
command
authority
there.
so
that
--
that
part's
not
covered.
so
in
the
situation
of
--
you
know,
somebody
asks,
well,
can
somebody
go
to
the
train
station
and
take
a
train,
if
they've
been
barred,
well,
yes,
they're
allowed
to
travel
on
the
highway
that
goes
there,
and
they're
allowed
to
wait
at
the
train
station
and
go.
and
that
arrangement,
obviously,
has
been
determined
by
the
appropriate
officials
to
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
--
the
military's
interests.
if
it
--
if
it
weren't,
i
imagine
we
would
see
a
different
arrangement,
but
the
accommodations
have
been
made.
i
think
the
larger
point
here,
though,
is
that,
if
the
commanding
officer
has
the
authority
to
issue
these
regulations
and
has
the
authority
to
issue
these
barments,
it
seems
--
across
the
whole
area,
which
i
think
is
not
really
subject
to
dispute
here,
the
--
as
justice
kennedy
points
out,
the
easement
says
he
can
regulate
the
use
of
the
highway.
if
you
have
that
authority,
why
put
the
sanction
there.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
it
would
be,
in
--
in
--
in
the
same
way
that
the
commanding
officer
can
determine
that
any
particular
use
of
the
highway
is
inconsistent
with
the
military's
needs.
that's
why
the
reservation
is
in
there,
precisely
to
--
to
reserve,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
the
appropriate
authority
to
the
commander
to
do
what
he
needs
to
do
to
run
the
installation.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
precisely
so.
and
--
and
if
he
--
and
the
odd
result
here,
under
respondent's
reading,
because,
of
course,
respondent's
reading
turns
on
the
coverage
of
what
“
military
installation
”
means,
and
that
covers
the
first
paragraph
of
section
1382
as
well,
which
deals
with
the
--
with
enforcing
regulations,
the
oddity
of
his
reading
is
that,
if
a
truck
then
did
drive
on
the
highway
bringing
the
flammable
materials,
the
truck
would
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
but
it's
sort
of
the
sound
of
one
hand
clapping
because
it
wouldn't
actually
be
a
misdemeanor
because
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
that
part
of
the
commander's
command
area.
that
incongruity
is
very
strange.
we
wouldn't
say
--
say,
in
the
national
parks
context,
if
the
park
service
has
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
feed
the
grizzly
bears,
it
means
you
can't
feed
the
grizzly
bears
anywhere
in
the
park.
it
doesn't
mean,
yeah,
you're
not
supposed
to,
but
it
won't
be
a
misdemeanor
if
you
feed
them
on
the
road,
but
you
--
you
can't
feed
them
off
the
road,
and
it
is
a
misdemeanor.
that's
--
that's
essentially
the
regime
that
respondent
suggests
this
statute--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that's
--
i
could--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
i
understand
it
to
be
based
on
neither
of
those
things.
i
understand
it
to
be
based
on
a
real
property
analysis,
which
says,
at
this
point,
where
respondent
was
found,
there
is
an
easement,
so
there
is
a
real
property
interest
that
is
held
by
someone
other
than
the
united
states;
therefore,
the
united
states
does
not
exclusively
possess
it.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
it's
not
respondent's
theory
here.
but
if
i
might
just
say
one
word
about
the
absurdities
--
the
kind
of
absurdities
that
the
ninth
circuit's
position
seems
like
it
might
lead
to
is
that
it
doesn't
seem
like
it's
limited
to
easements.
i
mean,
respondent,
of
course,
as
we
know,
wasn't
using
the
easement
for
its
purpose,
so
it's
just
sort
of
coincidence
he's
also
on
the
easement.
and
so,
on
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
maybe
there's
a
utility
easement,
or
maybe
there's
a
subsurface
mineral
rights
that
has
with
them
an
entry
and
egress
rights
or
something,
and
i
guess
that
also
would
defeat
on
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
the
application
of
1382,
which
seems
very
strange.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
--
that's
--
that's
a
matter
that
is
decided
under
the
--
the
enclaves
clause
of
the
constitution,
it
says
that
the
state
has
to
cede
to
the
united
states--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
jurisdiction.
so
the
state
has
ceded
to
the
united
states
that
jurisdiction
over
--
over
the
base.
the
united
states,
i
believe
it's
correct,
the
united
states
retroceded
that
jurisdiction
back
to
the
state
as
to
the
highways,
so
that
highway
patrol
officers
could
--
could
go
along
those
--
could
go
along
the
highways.
but
that's
really
a
separate
issue
from
what's
presented
here
because
that
would
control
the
application
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
for
example,
but
this
statute
--
this
statute
is
not
--
this
statute
is
a
freestanding
federal
statute.
and
i
would
say,
in
the
example
that
you
give,
i
think
this
--
it's
worth
talking
for
a
moment
about
the
situation,
where
the
united
states
leases
property
and
places
it
under
military
jurisdiction
and
gives
it
to
a
military
command.
there
certainly
are
such
places,
and
that's
why
an
ownership
test
isn't
quite
right.
i
think
an
ownership
test,
justice
kagan,
is
sort
of
right
about
95
percent
of
the
time
because
it's
usually
true
that
the
united
states
is
going
to
want
to
own
the
places
that
it
puts
under
military
command,
but
it's
not
perfect
in
the
leasing
context.
it's
also
--
it's
also
problematic
in
the
situation
that
comes
up
in
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
regarding
coast
guard
or
naval
security
zones,
which
are
designated
waters
adjacent
to
a
base
that
are
appurtenant
to
the
commander's
authority
over
the
base,
and
those
aren't
kind
of
owned
in
--
in
exactly
the
same
way.
but
they're,
nonetheless,
under
military
command,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
had
no
difficulty
seeing
that
they're
covered.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
too,
because
there
are
certainly
property
that
the
united
states
owns
--
plenty
of
property
--
most
property
that
the
united
states
owns
isn't
under
military
command.
and
so
it's
not
just
federal
ownership,
it's
--
although
i
would
--
i
would
point
out
that,
with
respect
to
these
other
statutes
that
deal
with
other
agencies
of
the
government
that
--
that
administer
lands,
it
is
generally
true
--
i
can't
say
that
it's
exclusively
--
it's
true
across
the
board
--
but
it's
generally
true
that
there's
a
statute,
something
like
this
one,
that
corresponds
to
the
regulatory
authority
of
a
land
management
agency.
so
--
and,
again,
we
wouldn't
punch
holes
in
the
misdemeanor
sanctions
that
back
up
those
other
land
management
agencies'
authority,
so
i
don't
see
why
we
would
punch
holes
in
this
statute,
either.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
--
speaking
outside
the
record,
it
seems
like
it
was
probably
drawn
to
guide
road
crews
in
the
parts
of
the
road
they
should
be
resurfacing
because
one
of
the
terms
of
the
easements
is
that
california
is
responsible
for
maintaining
the
road.
and
so
--
you
know,
when
the
california
department
of
transportation
road
crew
comes
out
to
repave
it
or
something,
they
need
to
know
how
--
how
wide,
how
far
are
we
supposed
to
go,
so
there
is
--
there's
this
green
line.
there
are
some
other
green
lines
scattered
on
other
places
of
the
base
in
various
shades
of
being
worn
down.
but
they're
--
i
think
they
can
be
taken
to
demarcate
the
extent
of
the
easement.
so
--
so
on
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
the
green
line
is
significant
for
that
reason
because
it
tells
you
which
side
is
which.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
particular
place
does
just
lie
within
a
road
that
is
miles
inside
the
actual
perimeter
--
outer
perimeter
of
the
base.
it's
a
couple
of
miles,
as
the
crow
flies.
it's
several
miles
as
you
travel
on
the
road.
so
it's
--
it's
not
as
if
it
sort
of
lies
out
--
outside
of
the
edge.
if
i
could
reserve?
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you.
just
a
couple
of
points.
i
--
i
think
the
colloquy
with
my
friend
sort
of
shows
that
taking
this
functional
approach
to
where
the
statute
applies
day
to
day,
place
to
place,
is
really
just
not
going
to
prove
workable.
and
we
have
to
remember,
this
is
a
misdemeanor
prosecution.
this
is
not
something
that
should
entail
an
extremely
extensive
subtle
inquiry
that
is
going
to
vary
from
place
to
place.
so
i
think
that
that
shows
the
wisdom
of
what
the
court
said
in
the
benson
case,
which
we
quote
at
page
15
and
16
of
our
reply
brief,
which
explains.
it
says
that:
"when
a
tract
has
been
legally
reserved
for
military
purposes,
courts
follow
the
action
of
the
political
department
of
the
government
and
will
not
inquire
what
the
actual
uses
to
which
any
portion
of
the
reserve
is
temporarily
put.
"
as
for
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
which
is
this
sort
of
real
estate-based
analysis,
i
think
there
have
been
a
number
of
hypotheticals
offered
that
show
why
that's
going
to
produce
some
borderline
absurd
or
entirely
absurd
results.
and
so
that's
why
we
come
back
to
again
respecting
the
decision
to
place
--
to
place
the
installation
under
military
command
and
that
section
1382
provides
the
sanction
to
enforce
the
orders
entered
pursuant
to
that
lawful
command.
i
might
say
one
word
about
the
green
line
and
its
relevance.
my
friend
says
that
it
is
sort
of
the
threshold
across
which
1382
applies
or
doesn't
apply.
the
relevance
in
a
1382
prosecution
of
the
green
line
comes
in
a
prosecution
under
the
first
paragraph
for
violating
a
regulation.
at
joint
appendix
51,
there's
the
commander's
order
closing
the
base,
and
what
it
says
is:
"pursuant
to
my
authority,
vandenberg
air
force
base
is
a
closed
base.
"
"general
rule
covering
the
entire
command
authority.
"
paragraph
2:
"the
roadway
easements
through
vandenberg
have
limited
use
as
provided.
"
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
"use
and
occupation
is
for
these
purposes
only
and
is
subject
to
any
rules
and
regulations
the
installation
commander
may
prescribe.
"
and
so
forth.
so
what
the
green
line
is,
is
it's
defining
the
boundary
between
the
closed
base,
the
generally
closed
base,
and
the
road,
which
is
open.
so
that
is
what
ensures
that
someone
who
is
driving
on
the
road
is
not
committing
an
offense
against
the
commander's
regulations,
if
they
are
just
an
ordinary
member
of
the
public.
and,
of
course,
if
they
cross
over
the
line,
then
they
are
violating
the
closed
base
regulation
if
they
don't
have
the
commander's
permission
to
cross
that
line.
so
the
--
what
is
different,
of
course,
about
respondent
is
that
he's
been
barred
from
the
base.
so
the
rules
that
apply
to
the
general
public
don't
apply
to
him.
of
course
that's
the
very
purpose
of
the
second
paragraph
of
section
1382,
is
to
recognize
that
commanders
can
make
individualized
determinations
that
the
rules
that
work
generally
for
the
public
don't
work
for
particular
people
who
show
themselves
to
be
willing
to
vandalize
government
property
or
disobey
the
instructions
to
remain
within
the
areas
that
they
may
lawfully
be
present
in.
and,
of
course,
that's
the
basis
for
why
respondent
was
barred.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
there
was
a
settlement
of
litigation
with
the
commander
in
the
late
1980s.
it's
in
the
--
it's
reproduced
--
part
of
it
is
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
--
which
i
guess
shows
a
couple
--
in
which
the
commander
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
place
on
the
base
where--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--to
be
honest,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
particular
legal
contentions
there.
but
i
think
what
the
settlement
does
show
is
that
if
it's
the
commander
who
is
authorizing
this,
the
commander
remains
in
charge
of
this.
and
of
course,
the
current
protest
policy
which
is
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
is
quite
clear
that
the
commander
retains
authority
to
--
and
can
control
the
time
and
place
of
the
protests,
and
of
course
makes
it
clear
that
people
who
are
barred
can't
come
back.
so
on
that
point,
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
avoidance
argument,
i
think,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
it
needs
to
be
a
serious
constitutional
doubt.
and
i
think
what
this
court
has
said
in
virginia
v.
hicks
puts
any
of
those
doubts
to
rest.
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
the
first
amendment
permits,
quote,
"the
punishment
of
a
person
who
has,
pursuant
to
lawful
regulation,
been
banned
from
a
public
park.
"
--so
i
think
a
fortiori
a
military
base
--
"after
vandalizing
it
and
who
ignores
that
ban
in
order
to
take
part
in
a
political
demonstration.
"
the
court
--
so
the
court
i
think
has
already
settled
this.
thank
you.
