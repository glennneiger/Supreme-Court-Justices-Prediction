justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
some
military
installations
are
located
in
very
rural
areas.
now,
suppose
you
have
an
installation
in
such
a
place
and
there
are
buildings
and
--
and
facilities
that
you
can
see
in
one
part
of
this
territory,
but
there's
a
lot
of
open
--
there
are
a
lot
of
open
fields
around
it.
would
--
and
suppose
there's
--
it's
not
posted.
would
that
still
be
a
military
installation
if
somebody
goes
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
didn't
want
to
protest.
he
just
wanted
to
take
a
drive
up
to
santa
barbara
or
--
i
don't
know
--
maybe
it's
--
i
don't
know
--
if
it's
not
illegal
to
walk
in
southern
california,
maybe
he
wanted
to
walk
along
the
pacific
coast
highway.
would
he
--
would
he
commit
a
misdemeanor
by
doing
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
horwich,
can
i
ask
you
this,
which
is
--
this
question
is
stimulated
by
what
justice
kagan
asked.
is
it
--
my
understanding
is
that,
if
you
look
at
many
military
reservations,
you
may
need
a
very
detailed
map
to
figure
out
--
and
a
crime
is
committed
someplace
on
there
or
other
federal
lands
--
you
may
need
a
very
detailed
map
to
determine
whether
criminal
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
offense
is
exclusively
federal
or
federal
and
concurrent.
now
--
and
i
would
assume
that
that
could
be
true
of
a
military
base
that
is
completely
sealed
off
to
the
public.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
do
you
understand
that
the
--
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
to
be
based
on
access
or
to
be
based
on
jurisdiction
over
crimes
that
are
committed
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
may
be
--
suppose
property
is
leased
to
--
i
don't
know
whether
this
actually
ever
occurs
--
but
suppose
it's
leased
to
the
united
states
and
used
for
a
military
reservation.
would
there
be
exclusively
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
there,
or
would
there
not
be
concurrent
jurisdiction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
ask
you
what
we
should
make
of
this
--
what
we
should
make
of
this
green
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
significance
of
the
green
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
really,
mr.
chemerinsky,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
sentence.
but,
i
mean,
i
may
own
a
parcel
of
property,
and
i
may
put
up
a
fence
around
my
property,
and
i
may
not
put
the
fence
right
at
the
very
edge
of
the
property.
i
may
leave
a
little
border
between
the
edge
of
my
property
and
the
place
where
the
fence
is.
now,
are
you
saying
that
i
have
ceded
exclusive
control
over
this
area
between
the
fence
and
the
end
of
the
property?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by,
“
exclusive
possession
”?
does
the
fence
have
any
relevance?
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
fence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
there
are
bases
that
have
no
fences.
so
what,
there?
none
of
that
is
under
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
government?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
still
completely
confused
about
the
test
that
you
are
asking
us
to
--
to
apply.
either
--
either
fences
are
relevant
or
they
are
not
relevant.
if
you
can
have
exclusive
governmental
--
exclusive
military
possession
of
a
base
where
there
are
no
fences,
i
don't
really
see
what
the
significance
is
of
the
fence
here.
that's
just
--
that's
just
for
starters.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
are
arguing
that
the
military
cannot
grant
an
easement
across
a
military
installation
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
public
to
drive
from
a
point,
let's
say,
to
the
south
to
a
point
to
the
north,
without
also
granting
an
easement
that
would
allow
people
to
linger
along
the
road
and
engage
in
first
amendment
activity.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
i
can
understand
why
the
military
might
be
willing
to
say,
well,
fine,
we
understand
that
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
to
make
everybody
drive
around
the
installation.
we'll
allow
them
to
drive
through,
but
we
do
not
want
people
lingering
here
because
that
does
create
security
concerns.
