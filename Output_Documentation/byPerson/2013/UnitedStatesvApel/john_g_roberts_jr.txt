chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
12-1038,
united
states
v.
apel.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
chemerinsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
raised
a
--
you
--
you
mentioned
the
green
line,
and
mr.
horwich
represented
some
facts
about
it
outside
the
record,
quite
properly
alerted
us
that
it
was
outside
the
record,
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
chance
to
respond
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
need
the
express
permission
of
the
base
commander
to
drive
down
the
road.
it's
just
that
he
has
given
it
to
the
public
at
large.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
it's
been
ceded
by
the
united
states
for
the
convenience
of
the
traveling
public.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
just
answered
the
question
from
justice
sotomayor
by
saying,
no,
no,
the
utility
easement
doesn't
work
because
the
military
commander
has
not
granted
permission
to
anybody
else
to
use
that
easement.
here
we
have
a
public
road
easement,
and
you
said
that's
different.
and
my
question
was:
no,
it's
not,
because
the
military
commander
has
given
permission
to
use
easement.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
distinguishes
the
two
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
usually
the
sort
of
determination
that's
left
to
the
military
commander.
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
reasons
why
the
commander
would
not
want
a
gathering
of
people
on
the
road
but
would
be
willing
to
let
people
drive
through
the
road.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
indicates,
as
the
--
the
barment
order
does,
that
he
does
see
some
kind
of
threat
by
allowing
somebody
in
there
who's
vandalized
the
base
in
the
past.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
--
can
there
be
a
temporary
forfeiture
of
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
talking
about
what
this
case
is
about,
which
is
the
temporary
exclusion.
would
your
case
be
the
same
if
mr.
apel
was
barred
for
one
year?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
he
can
traverse
it.
he
can
traverse.
there
--
there's
no
question
of
that.
could
he
be
barred
from
participating
in
protests
for
a
year
because
he
vandalized
the
base?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
here,
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
barred
permanently
subject
to
the
right
of
him
to
apply
for
removal
of
the
barment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
avoid
--
just
to
interrupt
--
to
avoid
grave
constitutional
doubts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
the
rule
of
lenity
you
said
in
favor
of
a
criminal
defendant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
talking
about
barment
here.
is
that
a
criminal
sanction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
but
this
doesn't
--
you're
not
allowed
to
collaterally
attack
the
barment
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
horwich,
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
