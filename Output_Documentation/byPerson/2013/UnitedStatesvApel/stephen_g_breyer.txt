justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
go
back
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
difficulty
that
i'm
having
is
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
reason
that
your
client
won
is
because
the
--
the
piece
of
grass
between
the
road
and
--
and
the
sign
was
not
--
it
was
subject
to
an
easement
and
the
government
lacked
the
exclusive
right
of
possession.
all
right.
when
i
saw
that,
i
thought,
well,
there
--
there
are
thousands
of
different
kinds
of
easement,
as
justice
kennedy
just
said.
they're
there
for
utilities.
they're
for
--
they're
there
for
people
who
might
want
to
--
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
a
million,
as
you
can,
too.
so
not
all
of
those
would
involve
first
amendment
anything,
and
--
and,
yet,
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
would
seem
to
say
that
your
client
could
go
and
demonstrate,
as
long
as
the
utility
company
had
an
easement.
so
how
are
we
supposed
to
interpret
the
statute
to
avoid
the
first
amendment
problem
without
getting
into
an
interpretation
that,
to
me,
would
seem
ridiculous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
does
the
first
amendment
allow
a
person
to
go
to
the
heart
of
the
military
base,
put
on
any
demonstration
they
want,
the
statute
doesn't
apply
for
the
reason
that,
once
every
four
months,
the
pg&e
has
an
easement
to
go
out
and
read
the
meter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
exactly
--
i
know
you
wouldn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
why
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
avoids
my
absurd
pg&e
result,
but,
nonetheless,
does
what
you
want,
which
is
to
protect
the
first
amendment
interests.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
let
me
press
--
at
the
risk
of
repetition,
the
reason
i'm
asking
this
question
is
the
record
is
not
developed.
i
looked
at
the
google
maps.
it
looked
to
me
like
this
area
is
sort
of
a
suburban
house
with
a
lawn
in
front
of
it,
and
you
drive
along
the
street,
and
you
suspect
that
the
street
may
belong
to
the
city
a
little
way
up
the
lawn;
but
beyond
that,
it
probably
belongs
to
the
homeowner.
and
when
you
try
to
see
where
does
the
green
line
cross
that
grassy
area,
you
can't
easily
tell,
and
--
and
it
may
be
just
a
foot
or
two.
so
it
may
have
been
inconceivable
that
your
client
didn't
cross
the
green
line
or
maybe
he
didn't.
i
don't
know.
so,
therefore,
you're
back
to
a
more
basic
test,
and
you
say,
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that,
if
they
do
not
have
exclusive
control,
the
military
can't
enforce
this
statute.
but
what
do
we
do,
which
was
my
question,
about
instances
where
the
military
does
not
have
exclusive
control,
but
the
reason
it
doesn't
has
nothing
to
do
with
roads,
nothing
to
do
with
green
lines,
it
has
to
do
with
thousands
of
other
easements
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case;
therefore,
i'm
pressing
you
to
get
a
definition
of
this
statute
that
will
serve
your
ends
without
getting
into
all
these
other
kinds
of
easements.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
that,
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
more
than
that.
it
says
i
mean,
you
know,
if
you
wanted
to
take
someone
to
school.
it
said
--
first,
if
you
need
medical
treatment,
you
can
just
go
in,
and
then
it
said
you
--
you
have
to
receive
prior
written
approval
from
me,
the
commander,
or
my
designee,
but
if
you
get
it.
so
i
suppose
if
he
had
a
child
at
the
school,
he
would
ask
and
they'd
give
it
to
him.
i
mean,
it
didn't
seem
to
me
an
absolute
bar.
it
seemed
to
me
a
bar
for
purposes
of
going
to
that
particular--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
we
have
to
get
into
any
of
that?
do
we
--
just
like
i
don't
know
where
he
really
was
physically.
i
don't
know
whether
that
grass
strip
is
within
something,
without
something.
these
all
sound
like
first
amendment
relevant
matters.
