how
do
we
tell
that,
mr.
horwich?
what's
the
test
for
determining
when
a
place
is
subject
to
military
command?
justice
elena
kagan
but
a
map,
presumably,
reflects
who
owns
the
property,
and
you,
yourself,
say
that
that's
not
what's
significant.
and
i
took
your
point
in
your
brief
to
suggest
some
kind
of
more
functional
test,
is
this
property
being
used
for
military
purposes?
am
i
--
am
i
wrong
in
ascribing
that
to
you?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think,
mr.
horwich,
that
there
is
any
point
at
which
a
military
installation
can
lose
its
character
as
such?
i
mean,
i'll
give
you
an
example.
suppose
--
you
know,
that
in
this
--
in
this
base
area,
the
government
--
the
military
decided
to
allow
four
private
condo
buildings
and
six
restaurants
and
three
movie
theaters,
and
it
really
just
turned
into
a
regular
old
town.
and
--
and
it
entered
into
agreements
whereby
all
the
policing
was
being
done
by
local
law
enforcement
officers,
rather
than
by
the
military.
is
there
any
point
at
which
it
just
becomes
too
much
not
like
a
military
base,
where
you
lose
the
ability
to
do
this,
even
though
it's
under
the
formal
command
of
a
military
officer?
justice
elena
kagan
so
what
happens,
for
example,
at
--
at
the
school
if
there's
an
assault
on
school
premises?
who
deals
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
federal
--
i'm
sorry.
is
that
military
police
or
is
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
mean,
who
--
who
comes
in
--
is
it
--
is
it
members
of
the
military?
or
is
it
members
of
the
county
police
force?
or
is
it--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
i
guess
i'm
just
wondering
with
respect
to
each
of
these
places,
i
mean,
the
highway,
the
school,
the
amtrak
station,
who's
actually
in
control
when
something
goes
wrong
in
these
places?
justice
elena
kagan
the
security
forces
meaning--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
military.
justice
elena
kagan
so
do
military
personnel
actively
patrol
this
entire
area?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
--
i
had
thought
that,
in
your
brief,
you
thought
that
the
ownership
test
was
both
underinclusive
and
overinclusive.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
chemerinsky,
does
that
mean--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
mr.
chemerinsky,
does
that
mean
that
the
--
the
government
could
not
have
issued
this
barment
order
in
the
first
place?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
then
i'm
--
i'm
perplexed
because
if
the
government
has
sufficient
commanding
authority
to
issue
the
barment
order
to
say,
notwithstanding
that
mr.
apel
had
not
crossed
the
green
line,
that
--
you
know,
he
just
can't
be
here,
and
he's
excluded,
then
why
don't
they
have
sufficient
authority
to
prevent
him
from
reentering?
justice
elena
kagan
i
see.
so--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
you're
saying
that
if
he
had
not
crossed
the
green
line,
he
could
not
have
been
excluded?
justice
elena
kagan
and
you're
saying
that
the
military
cannot
exclude
any
person
from
any
of
this
area
outside
the
green
line?
justice
elena
kagan
your
--
your
argument
is
sort
of
a
use
it
or
lose
it
argument,
is
that
correct?
that
the
government
has
this
commanding
authority,
unless
the
government
uses
it
to
its
full
extent
every
day
of
the
week,
it
loses
it?
justice
elena
kagan
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
government
makes
is,
look,
what
the
military
wants
to
do
here
is
something
very
sensible.
it
keeps
tight
what
it
needs
to
keep
tight,
but
it
allows
to
be
more
open
areas
that
can
--
that
it
--
it
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
securing
entirely.
and
that's
for
the
convenience
of
military
personnel.
it's
for
the
convenience
of
other
people
who
live
around
the
base.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
may
i
just
ask
a
background
question,
mr.
horwich?
what's
the
history
of
this
first
amendment
area?
what
--
when
did
this
speech
area
come
into
being?
justice
elena
kagan
was
the
litigation
essentially
like
this
one,
basically
saying
that
this
was
not
under
military
command?
