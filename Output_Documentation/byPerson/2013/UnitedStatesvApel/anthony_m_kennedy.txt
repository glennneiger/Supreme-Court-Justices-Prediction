justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
confirmed
in
the
terms
of
the
easement,
if
you
look
at
the
easement
between
the
u.s.
and
the
county
of
santa
barbara.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
military
commander
has
authority
to
exercise
control
over
the
easement
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose,
if
the
commander
thought
it
was
necessary,
he
could
stop
trucks
with
flammable
materials
from
coming
through
at
the
time
when
a
launch
is
being
prepared
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
that
was
a
first
amendment
case
and
the
--
and
the
problem
there
was
that
he
was
barred
for
a
peaceful
protest
the
first
time
around,
and
that's
not
--
that's
not
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that's
a
first
amendment
case.
but
let's
concentrate
first
on
--
on
the
argument
you
make
under
this
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
according
to
normal
rules
of
easements,
and
the
owner
of
the
subservient
easement,
the
easement
holder,
cannot
overburden
that
easement.
it
cannot
--
i've
got
an
easement
on
the
back
of
my
property
for
the
utility
company.
they
can't
hold
a
picnic
there.
they
can't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
overburdening
the
easement,
and
this
is
standard
stuff.
and
it's
right
in
the
easement
agreement
with
the
city
of
santa
barbara,
that
the
police
--
that
the
military
commander
can
make
reasonable
regulations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
you
may
--
you
have
a
first
amendment
argument.
i
understand
that.
but
let's
just
concentrate
on
the
property
ownership.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
back
on
the
first
amendment
case.
it
--
it
may
or
may
not.
if
the
--
if
the
commander
wants
to
close
the
base
for
a
rocket
launch,
he
certainly
--
he
certainly
can.
that's
set
forth
in
article
--
or
a
condition
of
paragraph
4
of
the
easement.
