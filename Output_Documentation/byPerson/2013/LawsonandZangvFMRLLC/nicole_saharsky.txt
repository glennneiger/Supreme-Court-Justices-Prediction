ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
protects
an
employee
of
a
contractor
from
retaliation.
that's
what
the
text
says.
that's
what
congress
intended
to
cover,
these
accountants,
lawyers,
and
outside
auditors
who
were
so
central
to
the
fall
of
enron.
i'd
like
to
go
right
to
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
had
about
the
limits
of
the
statute
and
how
it
would
be
applied.
now,
of
course,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
really
the
core
of
the
statute,
a
contractor
retaliating
against
its
own
employees.
and
we
think
that
when
the
first
circuit
said
that
that
is
unambiguously
not
covered
by
the
statute,
that
it's
wrong.
but
moving
beyond
that,
assuming
that
that
is
covered
and
asking
some
of
these
--
or
answering
some
of
these
questions
about
the
limit.
first
of
all,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
the
statute
applies
to
individuals
who
are
in
a
position
who
have
information
about
fraud
or
securities
law
violations
are
in
a
position
to
report
it.
so
it
is
very
unlikely
that
that
would
be
the
gardener.
it's
incredibly
likely
that
it
would
be
an
accountant
or
auditor,
like
a
person
who
worked
for
arthur
andersen.
another--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
but
i
think
it
raises
--
your
question
raises
a
--
another
limitation
on
the
statute,
which
is
when
the
statute
talks
about
contractors
and
subcontractors,
it's
contractor
of
a
public
company.
so
that
it's
talking
about
the
contractor
working
in
its
capacity
for
the
public
company,
not
the
contractor
doing
some
other
type
of
work.
so
if
the
contractor's
work
is
for
the
public
company
and
there
is
fraud
being
committed
by
the
contractor,
yes,
that
is
something
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
it
was
concerned
about
the
fact
that
arthur
andersen
was
committing
fraud,
not
against
enron.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
it
can
be
fraud
by
the
contractor
while
the
contractor
is
fulfilling
its
role
as
a
contractor
for
the
public
company,
not
the
contractor
in
some
other
capacity.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
in
that
capacity.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
〝
of
such
company
″.
the
words
"contractor
and
subcontractor
of
such
company.
"
now,
it
says--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
but
we
think
that
when
you're
reading
the
statute
holistically,
that
that's
the
most
natural
reading.
now,
i
point
out
here
that
these
are
not
questions
that
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
board,
which
is
entitled--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
i
think
this
is
a
completely
understandable
concern
that
was
raised
by
the
first
circuit.
i
have
several
responses
to
it.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
you
don't
need
to
decide
it
in
this
case.
it's
--
this
is
a
fairly
mainstream
application.
second
of
all,
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
expert
agency
should
consider
in
the
first
instance.
there
have
not
been
cases,
except
for
the
spinner
case,
that
really
has
--
that
really
have
considered
these
questions
about
contractors
and
subcontractors.
in
the
history
of
this
statute,
there
are
only
about
20
published
cases
that
have
ever
reached
the
courts
of
appeals.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no,
justice
kennedy.
my
suggestion
was,
because
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
some
of
these
more
far-fetched
applications
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
that
it
should
leave
it
to
the
expert
agency
in
the
first
instance.
the
rule
that
we
would--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
sorry.
i
should
be
more
clear.
what
we
think
that
this
court
should
say
is
that
the
natural
reading
of
this
provision
covers,
protects
employees
of
contractors.
the
first
circuit
said
that
employees
of
contractors
are
not
protected
at
all
from
retaliation.
and
we
think
that
that
is
wrong.
so
that
would
be
step
one.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
this
is
a
contractor
retaliating
against
its
own
employees
and
it's
within
the
work
that
the
contractor
is
doing
for
the
mutual
fund.
this
is
investment
advising.
this
is
the
heart
of
what
contractors
of
mutual
funds
do
for
mutual
funds.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
are
--
there
are
several
limitations.
the
first
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
person
who
is
in
a
position
to
detect
and
report
the
types
of
fraud
and
securities
violations
that
are
included
in
the
statute.
second,
we
think
that
〝
the
contractor
of
such
company
″
refers
to
the
contractor
in
that
role,
working
for
the
public
company.
third,
the
expert
agency
that
has
considered
this
question
has
looked
at
whether
there
would
be
a
floodgates
open
and
has
concluded
--
and
this
is
on
page
166
of
the
petition
appendix
--
that
there
are
built-in
limits
so
that
there
would
not
be
those
floodgates.
and
fourth,
i
can
tell
you
as
an
empirical
matter,
that
no
floodgates
have
been
opened.
the
department
of
labor
has
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
this
way
since
the
beginning
of
sox
and
you'll
find
on
osha's
website
that
it's
only
150
or
maybe
200
complaints
per
year
that
are
filed
with
the
agency.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
that's
right.
and
the
only
thing
that
i
would
add
to
that
is
that
it
could
be
fraud
that's
being
reported
that
the
contractor
is
engaging
in
fraud
in
that
contract
or
that
the
public
company
is
engaging
in
fraud.
but
congress
would
have
wanted
both
those
covered.
it
was
arthur
andersen
and
enron
that
were
involved
in
the
fraud
that
led--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
--
that
is
my
understanding
as
well.
but
i
think
on
the
main
question
that's
raised
by
this
case,
which
is
whether
contractors
can
ever
be
covered,
and
the
first
circuit
said
that
they
can't,
we're
in
complete
agreement.
i
also
want
to
point
this
court
to
the
board's
opinion
in
this
case,
which
we
think
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
it's
an
exceptionally
thorough
opinion
when
the
board
went--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it's
because
the
agency
has
been
given
this
authority.
and
the
court
has
faced
cases
before
where
it
has
afforded
chevron
deference
even
though
that
was
not
an
issue
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
point
the
court
to
ins
v.
agere.
it's
the
--
congress
has
entrusted
this
expert
agency
with
making
decisions
through
formal
adjudication.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
there
is
no
rulemaking
authority
for
this
provision
under
1514a
delegated
to
a
different--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--not
for
this
provision.
for
other
parts
of
sox,
yes.
but
the
anti-retaliation
provision
in
sox,
like
about
20
other
anti-retaliation
provisions,
is
entirely
handled
by
the
department
of
labor
and
it's
entirely
handled
through
formal
adjudication.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
they
said
that,
but
then
they
also
cited
several
of
their--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it
said
that
it
was
not
providing
an
interpretation,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
the
court
realizes
that
there
are
many
other
things
that
the
spinner
decision
relied
on.
i
point
the
court
to
footnote
8
at
page
143
of
the
board's
decision
where
it
says:
"in
addition
to
this
regulation,
we're
relying
on
several
of
our
prior
decisions.
"
--many
of
which
do
not
even
cite
the
regulation
--
"and
our
decades
of
experience
in
looking
at
similar
statutes
like
air-21.
"
so
to
think
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
don't
think
that
the
agency
--
may
i
finish?
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--should
be
worse
off
because
everyone
who
has
considered
this
question
within
the
agency
has
come
to
the
same
conclusion
over
a
period
of
a
decade.
