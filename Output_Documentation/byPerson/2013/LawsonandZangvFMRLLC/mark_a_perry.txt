mr.
mark
a.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
alito
asked
why
didn't
congress
say
all
employers
or
no
employers?
there
are
approximate
40
whistleblower
statutes
on
the
books
as
of
today,
your
honors.
and
more
than
30
of
them,
in
fact,
36
of
them,
are
phrased
exactly
that
way.
they
say
〝
no
employer
may
retaliate
″
or
"any
employer
is
prohibited
from
retaliating.
"
this
statute
is
not
phrased
that
way.
this
statute,
which
congress
could
have
written
that
way,
and
dodd-frank
922
is
written
that
way,
this
statute
is
written
quite
differently.
this
statute
says,
〝
no
public
company
may
retaliate
″,
and
then
it
has
a
subordinate
clause
and
the
subordinate
clause
is
what's
at
issue
here,
that
references
officers,
employees,
contractors,
subcontractors
and
agents.
justice
alito
also
asked
my
friend,
mr.
schnapper,
do
you
contend
that
the
same
construction
should
be
given
to
officers
and
to
contractors,
and
he
acknowledged
they
have
to
say
no,
because
the
arb
has
also
said
no.
in
other
words,
an
employee,
the
phrase
that
we
are
construing
at
the
bottom
of
all
of
this,
these
turtles,
is
different
they
say
for
officers
and
employees
and
agents,
presumably,
than
for
contractors
and
subcontractors.
but
that
doesn't
fit
with
the
statute.
it
doesn't
fit
with
the
tools
of
statutory
construction,
and
it
doesn't
fit
with
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here.
this
was
the
--
the
failure
of
enron.
this
was
a
bankruptcy
situation.
congress
was
acutely
aware
that
corporate
bankruptcies,
failures,
left
victims
high
and
dry.
one
of
the
other
provisions
in
this
title,
section
803,
specifically
deals
with
the
dischargeability
of
shareholder
fraud
debts
in
bankruptcy.
and
what
these
sub
--
the
subordinate
clause
that
added
these
corporate
representatives
does
is
make
sure
that
if
the
employer,
the
public
company,
goes
out
of
business,
the
way
enron
had
just
done,
somebody
is
on
the
hook
for
the
money
damages
that
congress
authorized
for
these
employees
like
sharon
watkins.
it's
a
very
simple
regime
to
make
sure
that
the
victim,
the
whistleblower,
is
not
left
high
and
dry
if
the
company
that
is,
by
hypothesis,
riddled
with
fraud
goes
out
of
business.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
alito,
the
accounting
firms
are
not
covered
by
806,
and
let
me
explain
that.
accountants,
accounting
firms,
and
auditors
are
referenced
by
name
153
times
in
the
sarbanes-oxley
act,
including
in
section
802
in
this
title.
it
says,
〝
no
accountant
shall
shred
documents
″.
806
doesn't
refer
to
accountants
anywhere.
it
refers
to
contractors.
and
nowhere--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
contractor
that's
being
referred
to
here
--
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
that
suggests
that
an
accountant
is
a
contractor.
and
more
importantly,
the
reason
for
this
is--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
the
matter
that
the
congress
left
to
the
expert
agencies.
the
accounting
firms
are
regulation
by
section
105
and
the
pcaob.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
if
the--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--to
this
day,
the
agencies
have
not
written
rules
requiring
that.
they
could.
and
--
and
i
would
refer
the
court
respectfully
to
section
501
dealing
with
securities
analysts,
where
congress
required
the
sec
to
write
a
rule
protecting
whistleblowers
at
the
investment
banks
that
are
securities
analysts.
so
when
congress
wanted
to
protect
those
people--
what
congress
did
for
the
accountants
and
lawyers
was
not
to
protect
whistleblowers.
it
imposed
a
mandate.
section
10(a)--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
sec
for
the
lawyers.
that's
section
307.
and
the
pcaob
for
the
accountants.
that's
section
105.
and
section
10(a)
of
the
exchange
act,
which
is
incorporated
by
reference,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
arb
is
nowhere
involved
with
lawyers
or
accountants,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
--
in
the
pcaob
case.
the
congress
decided
to
put
the
entire
accounting
profession
under
the
thumb
of
that
new
board.
that
is
a
--
a
purpose-built
regulatory
agency
that
regulates
birth
to
death
of
the
accounting
industry.
and
if
they
want
to
protect
whistleblowers
or
not
protect
whistleblowers,
that
is
the
board's
business.
congress
didn't
do
anything
there.
what
congress
did
in
806
was
regulate
the
public
companies
and
their
employees.
but
we
can
see
this.
this
--
this
tracks
very
clearly
through
the
legislative
history.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
let
me
answer
that
in
two
steps,
justice
breyer.
first,
with
due
respect,
the
court
inverted
the
statute.
it
actually
says,
〝
no
public
company
″,
comma,
〝
or
″--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--it's
not
extraneous
here
because
it
is
--
it
is
subordinating
the
contractors
to
the
public
employees.
and
what
--
more
importantly,
second,
what
congress
is
doing
--
and
this
is
in
response
to
my
friend's
question
was
this
a
meaningless
act?
if
i
could
point
the
court
to
the
kalkunte
case.
the
kalkunte
case
is
an
arb
decision
from
2009.
it's
cited
at
page
16
of
the
government's
brief.
here
is
a
bankrupt
company
and
the
estate
brings
in
a
workout
firm,
a
privately-held
contractor
to
wind
down
the
affairs
of
the
company.
and
this
private
contractor
decides
that
there's
a
squeaky
wheel
employee
within
the
legal
department
and
fires
her.
and
she
sues
under
section
806
both
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt
company,
that
is
the
public
company
employer
in
the
first
primary
clause
of
this
statute,
and
the
workout
firm,
the
contractor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--we--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--three
points
here,
your
honor.
first,
when
congress
wishes
to
reach
investment
advisors,
in
sox
and
elsewhere
it
amends
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
and
the
investment
advisors
act
of
1940.
and
for
this
i
can
point
you
to
dodd-frank
922,
the
parallel
whistleblower's
provision
that
my
friends
haven't
talked
about,
but
is
very
important
here
because
it
does
cover
all
employers.
and
when
congress
covered
all
employers
in
dodd-frank,
it
amended
the
1940
acts
to
make
clear
that
investment
advisors
were
included.
and
the
sec
has
issued
its
form
tcr
that
applies
to
investment
advisors.
congress
didn't
do
any
of
that
in
sarbanes-oxley.
second,
we
know
the
very
next
congress
after
sarbanes-oxley,
took
up
the
mutual
reform
--
mutual
fund
reform
act,
which
would
have
amended
section
806
to
include
investment
advisors,
to
do
exactly
what
the
petitioners
in
this
case
say
the
statute
did.
why
would
congress
have
taken
up,
the
very
next
congress
--
all
the
same
members
are
still
there;
senator
sarbanes
was
still
there
--
taken
up
a
bill
to
do
that?
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
scalia,
it's
not
just
firing.
it's
also
harassing.
it's
also
threatening.
these
are
contractors
who
may
be
working--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--sure,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
it
can
--
there
have
contractors
that
are
in
the
operation,
management
consultants
and
others
that
are
working
side
by
side
with
public
company
employees
who
can
make
their
lives
difficult,
who
can
make
their
lives
intolerable,
who
can
lead
to
a
constructive
discharge
if
it's
bad
enough.
and
this
court
has
said
in
the
title
vii
context,
that
that
kind
of
discrimination
does
not
require
a
supervisory
relationship,
and
these
contractors,
just
like
agents
and
officers,
employees,
may
have
that
ability
to
affect
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
public
company's
employees.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
accountants
and
lawyers.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
absolutely.
but,
you
know,
if
there
are
--
i
mean,
they
are
not
covered
by
--
for
their
own
employees.
if
they
were
to
discriminate
against
a
public
company
employee
--
the
public
company's
employees
are
always
protected.
that
is
the
subject
of
this
statute,
the
employees
of
the
public
company.
let's
look
at
the
title.
we
know
congress
didn't
leave
a
big
mystery
about
who
they
were
protecting
here:
whistleblower
protection
for
employees
of
publicly-traded
companies.
that's
what
the
congress
told
us--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--against
the
public
company's
employees,
i
--
i
absolutely
agree.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
if
i
said
that,
i
--
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
i
didn't
say
they
weren't
contractors.
i
said
they
weren't
regulated
as
contractors
here
because
they
were
specifically
regulated
as
accountants
elsewhere.
if
they
fit
within
the
statute--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--let
me
--
let
me
try
to
be
much
clearer.
the
government
makes
the
point
that
this
statute
is
written
to
cover
arthur
andersen.
i
can't
agree
with
that.
arthur
andersen
appears
all
over
this
statute,
and
there's
two
titles
of
this
statute
that
deal
with
accountants.
arthur
andersen
might
be
included
here
if
it
--
if
it
discriminates
against
a
client,
an
audit
client's
employee.
that
--
that's
just
a
normal
contracting
or
agency
relationship.
that's
what
congress
was
dealing
with.
what's
not
covered
is
arthur
andersen
retaliating
against
its
own
employees.
that
is
what
congress
gave
to
the
board
to
decide
or
for
the
lawyers
to
the
sec
to
decide.
and,
again,
i
would
have
to
point
the
court
to
section
501,
which
ordered
the
sec
to
make
a
rule
protecting
securities
analysts.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
they
--
they
are
defending
the
arb's
decision.
i
agree
with
that.
the
arb's
decision,
however,
is
--
all
comes
back
to
this
procedural
regulation
that
osha
promulgated
that
they
agree
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
so
it's
not
a
reasoned
articulation
of
the
government's
position.
it
is,
rather,
a
post
hoc
rationalization
of
what
the
osha
said
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the
dissent
in
the
first
circuit,
like
the
arb,
i
agree,
disassociates
the
statute,
the
language
〝
an
employee
″
from
its
context,
from
its
grammar,
from
its
syntax,
from
the
title
of
the
statute,
from
the
legislative
history.
i
mean,
the
senate
report,
your
honor,
goes
through
six
times
to
explain
what
is
the
problem
being
addressed.
and
congress
says,
"there
is
no
current
protection
for
employees
of
publicly-traded
companies.
"
that's
at
page
18.
so
what
does
this
legislation
do,
section
806?
it
provides
protection
for
employees
of
publicly-traded
companies.
that's
at
page
19.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
first,
the
very
need
for
this
discussion
about
limitations,
which
is
found
nowhere
in
the
statute
and
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history,
is
eliminated
if
the
court
were
to
construe
the
statute
as
chief
judge
lynch
and
the
majority
did
below
for--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that's
exactly
right.
well,
it's
the
limitation
that
congress
put
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
if
we
go
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
universally
accepted
by
my
friends
on
this
side
that
some
limitation
is
needed.
it
can't
be
every
company
with
a
contract
to
the
public
company,
except
that
is
what
the
arb
said
a
contractor
is.
okay?
and
it
can't
be
every
kind
of
misconduct,
except
that's
what
the
arb
has
said
this
statute
covers.
and
i
point
to
the
lockheed
case,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
fraud
against
shareholders.
this
is
a
run-of-the-mill
adulterous
affair
by
a
--
by
a
gossip
--
by
an
office
gossip
and
a
supervisor
that
the
person
brings
a
lawsuit
under
section
806
saying
that
is
fraud
because
she
submitted
her
expense
accounts.
so
what
we
have
is--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--as
wire
fraud,
your
honor,
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
in
the
lockheed
case,
correct.
so,
justice
breyer,
your
gardener,
your
three-person
gardener,
there's
a
couple
of
problems
with
it.
first,
if
the
same
gardening
company
works
for
ken
lay
and
for
enron
--
this
goes
back
to
justice
alito's
question
--
my
friend's
argument
is
they're
covered
when
they
work
for
enron
but
not
covered
when
they
work
for
ken
lay.
that's
a
bizarre
reading
of
the
statute.
okay?
second,
they're
covered
under
the
--
all
of
the
so-called
limitations
they've
been
offered
if
the
junior
gardener
thinks
--
hears
gossip
that
the
senior
gardener
is
having
an
affair
and
submitting
false
expense
reports
regarding
the
hotel
receipts
--
that's
the
facts
of
the
lockheed
case
--
and
reports
that
to
the
middle
gardener,
and
nothing
happens,
and
then
the
junior
gardener
gets
fired
because
the
economy
downturns
or
something.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
there
are
still
the
state
law
protections,
of
course,
for
public
policy
and
other
protections.
there
is
the
dodd-frank
act.
we
haven't
talked
about
it
enough.
dodd-frank
922
came
in
eight
years
later
and
said
--
congress
said
we
think
we
need
to
do
more.
we
think
we
need
to
cover
all
employers,
but
we're
going
to
provide
more
limitations.
we're
going
to
require
a
written
submission
to
the
sec
under
penalty
of
perjury,
and
we're
going
to
limit
it
to
securities
fraud.
so
if
the
butler
learns
that
the
boss
is
doing
something
untoward,
the
butler
then
can
go
to
the
sec
and
make
a
complaint.
if
it
pans
out,
he
can
even
get
a
bounty
under
that
program.
and
if
he
gets
fired,
he's
completely
protected
and
has
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
congress
dealt
with
that.
there
--
there
is
a
gap
of
eight
years.
we
definitely
acknowledge
that.
but
congress
moves
incrementally
in
this
area.
the
--
the
sarbanes-oxley
act
was
the
first
major
widespread
corporate
governance
reform
at
the
federal
level,
and
congress
didn't
purport
to
do
everything
at
once.
it
went
a
long
way.
it
subjected
every
public
company
to
these
new
things.
but
for
my
friends
to
suggest
that
they
covered
not
just
the
5,000
public
companies,
but
all
6
million
private
companies
without
ever
mentioning
the
fact,
without
ever
discussing
it,
without
debating
it,
without
acknowledging
that
that
would
be
the
consequence
is
a
dramatic
--
a
dramatic
expansion
of
this
statute
that
was
already
pretty
dramatic
to
begin
with,
that
barely
passed,
as
the
court
may
remember.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
would
be
a
--
a
limitation.
i
don't
agree
that
it's
found
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
as
a
--
as
a
defense
lawyer,
i
would
like
that
down
the
road.
but
--
and
the
arb
in
the
lockheed
case
didn't
seem
to
suggest
that
there
is
any
such
limitation.
the
arb
simply
said
fraud.
and
mr.
schnapper,
petitioners
here
certainly
took
that
position
today.
so
it's
every
fraud
of
any
sort
by
any
company
that
has
a
contract--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that's
why
i
pointed
to
the
arb's
decision
in
lockheed,
your
honor.
and
the
language
there
is
exceedingly
sweeping.
it
rejected
all
limitations
that
were
offered
in
that
case.
the
government's
so-called
limitation
is
no
limitation
at
all.
it
is
simply
anything
that
is
fraudulent
is
covered
according--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
--
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
return
to
the
point
of
this
discussion
of
limitations,
which
is
fascinating,
but
we
are
having
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
congress
never
had
this
discussion.
congress
never
discussed
limitations
because
congress
never
contemplated
covering
private
companies.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
it
is
not
in
the
terms
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
and,
as
i
just
said,
that
was
the
holding
of
the
lockheed
case
in
arb.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
that's
the
danger
of
moving
beyond
the
text
of
the
statute.
they
won't
admit,
my
friends
won't
admit,
that
every
contractor
and
every
fraud
is
covered.
but
that
is
the
import
of
their
argument.
we
submit
that
that's
not
right,
or
at
least
that
that
decision,
if
it
is
right,
should
be
made
by
the
congress
or
by
an
agency
with
rulemaking
authority
on
the
public
record
to
take
public
responsibility
for
it.
no--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
they
have
not
had
that
rulemaking
since
this
statute
was
enacted
in
2002,
and
we
don't
know
whether
they
will
have
that
rulemaking.
the
court's
opportunity
and
i
would
submit
obligation,
respectfully,
is
to
read
the
statute
as
it
was
passed
by
congress.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
ms.
saharsky
said
that
the
sec
has
no
power
to
make
rules
under
section
806.
i
--
i
am
not
going
to
quarrel
with
her
on
that.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
we
would,
but
we
would
also
have
a
rulemaking
record
and
a
cost-benefit
analysis
of
the
impact
on
private
companies
and
the
impact
on
employment
and
all
of
the
things
that
agencies
have
to
take
into
account
when
they
make
these
determinations,
none
of
which
exists
on
this
record.
we
simply
have
the
arb
deciding
5,000,
6
million,
good
enough,
let's
move
forward.
and
that
is
not,
we
submit,
what
congress
intended
here.
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
arb
to
be
able
to
make
that
decision.
both
of
my
friends
here
agree
that
our
reading,
the
first
circuit's
reading,
is
a
plausible
construction
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
argument
that
it
is
unambiguous
on
their
side.
okay?
so
their
argument
must
be
that
congress
intended
not
to
be
able
to
answer
this
question,
not
to
know
whether
it's
5,000
public
companies
or
6
million
private
companies,
and
so
they
punted
that
to
an
unelected
board
of
lawyers
within
the
labor
department.
that
is
not
plausible.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
to
be
quite
blunt,
justice
breyer,
before
the
government's
concession
20
minutes
ago,
i
would
have
thought
the
same
thing.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
we
can
certainly
say
this,
though.
what
we
know
is
the
sec
has
not
exercised
its
power
under
3(a)
or
under
307
or
under
501,
also
dealing
with
contractors
of
sorts,
to
provide
for
whistleblower
protections.
if
it
chooses
to
do
so
in
the
future,
then
we
would
have
a
different
lawsuit.
what
we
have
now,
however,
is
the
unadorned
statute
passed
by
congress,
which
deals
with
public
companies.
we
have
the
first
circuit
in
an
exhaustive
opinion
construing
it,
again
using
all
the
ordinary
tools
of
statutory
construction,
which
this
court
has
directed
the
lower
courts
to
do,
to
determine
plausibly,
as
everyone
agrees,
plausibly
that
it
only
covers
public
companies.
we
have
a
reading,
then,
that
gives
meaning
to
every
single
meaning
to
every
single
word
in
the
statute,
that
is
comprehensible,
that
fits
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
remember
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute
is
disclosure
by
public
companies.
it
is
not
protection
of
investors,
as
some
at
times
have
said.
it
is
disclosures
by
public
companies.
private
companies
make
no
disclosures.
they
are
not
governed
by
the
securities
laws.
so
excluding
private
company
employees
makes
perfect
sense
in
that
respect.
mutual
funds,
mr.
schnapper
at
page
13
of
his
reply
brief
says:
well,
the
advisors
make
all
the
disclosures
for
the
mutual
funds.
we
had
that
argument,
your
honor,
two
years
ago.
justice
thomas
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
janus
case,
which
rejected
that
very
argument
and
said
the
mutual
fund
and
the
advisor
are
separate
companies;
the
mutual
fund
makes
the
disclosures.
congress
has
set
up
the
mutual
fund
industry
that
way.
the
ici's
brief
in
this
case
explains
very
cogently,
i
believe,
all
of
the
separate
protections,
including
the
independent
board
of
directors
and
the
chief
compliance
officer
mandated
by
the
sec's
'40
act
recommendations,
that
protect
the
investors
in
mutual
funds.
so
we
have
a
coherent,
on
the
first
circuit
side,
a
coherent
reading
of
the
statute
that
my
friends
admit
is
plausible,
that
gives
meaning
to
every
word
in
the
statute,
that
fits
exactly
the
title
that
congress
used.
and
the
title
is
legislative
language
passed
by
congress
signed
by
the
president.
it
fits
every
word
of
the
legislative
history.
it
makes
perfect
sense
and
it
doesn't
have
any
untoward
results.
we
submit
that--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
alito,
it
gives
employees
two
things.
they
give
another
defendant,
which
means
another
insurance
policy.
so
for
example,
if
you
sue
the
company
you
get
the
e&o
policy.
if
you
sue
the
president
at
the
same
time,
you
get
the
d&o
policy.
so
you
get
two
separate
insurance
companies,
which
is
more
money,
more
availability.
you
get
the
personal
liability.
officers
hate
to
be
sued;
so
do
contractors.
and
if
the
public
company
goes
out
of
business,
you
get
that
protection
of
monetary
relief.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
you
have
the
axe-wielding
specialist.
the
real
world
is
kalkunte.
i
gave
you
that
case
where
that
actually
happened.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
well,
your
honor,
that
was
one
of
six
cases
the
arb
decided
under
this
statute
in
2009.
so
that
year
that
was
one-sixth
of
the
cases.
that's
not
--
i
mean,
it
happens,
okay?
and
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
conceivable
scenario
in
many
more
things
because,
again,
it's
not
limited
to
discharge.
it's
also
threats
and
harassment,
and
we
certainly
can
see
situations
where
contractors,
particularly
those
kinds
of
contractors
like
management
consultants,
photocopy
vendors,
and
so
forth,
are
in
the
facility
with
the
public
company
employees,
can
make
their
life
miserable.
and
remember,
i
am
going
to
agree
with
my
friend
mr.
schnapper
on
something.
congress
recognized
that
enron
was
structured
in
a
way
to
try
to
get
the
liability
out
of
headquarters.
they
had
all
these
subsidiaries,
they
had
chewco
and
ponderosa
and
all
this.
and
congress
recognized
that
corporations
might
try
to
avoid
their
liability,
so
that
by
picking
up
officers,
employees,
contractors,
subcontractors
and
agents,
they
were
trying
to
make
sure
that
if
the
company
tried
to
lay
off
the
responsibility
on
somebody
else,
they
would
still
get
captured
because
their
employees
were
doing
it.
they
could
have
done
that
just
under
agency.
many
employment
laws,
of
course,
speak
only
of
officers,
employees,
and
agents.
but
many
contracts
disclaim
agency,
disclaim--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
breyer--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
breyer,
it
appears
--
that
formulation
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
code
in
this
law.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
we
know
--
we
don't
know
the
--
i
don't
know
the
individual.
we
know,
however,
that
there
is
a
senate
report
that
accompanied
that
language
when
it
was
introduced.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
only
hearing
testimony
was,
for
example,
the
national
whistleblowers
center,
one
of
the
amici
here,
said
corporate
insiders,
publicly
traded
companies.
there
is
nothing
--
the
word
〝
contractor
″
specifically
appears
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history.
in
the
entire
legislative
history
of
the
sarbanes-oxley
act,
every
hearing,
every
floor
statement,
every
report,
it
nowhere
appears.
it
came,
the
word
〝
contractor
″
came
from
the
air-21
act,
but,
of
course,
the
air-21
act
doesn't
have
〝
officers,
employees
or
agents
″.
that
is
language
from
title
vii.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
it
did,
your
honor.
and
as
i
said,
150
times
〝
accountants
″
appear.
if
i
could
just
finish
with
this
point.
the
senate
report
lists
four
examples
of
the
so-called
corporate
code
of
silence:
the
andersen
partner,
the
vinson
and
elkins
lawyers,
the
ubs
securities
analyst,
and
sharon
watkins
at
enron.
congress
dealt
with
them
in
four
different
provisions:
section
105
for
the
accountants,
section
307
for
the
lawyers,
section
501
for
the
securities
analysts,
and
section
806
for
the
public
company
employee.
and
then
--
we
haven't
talked
about
this
yet,
either
--
it
added,
for
good
measure,
section
1107,
which
says
whoever
shall
retaliate
against
anybody
who
provides
information
to
a
law
enforcement
officer,
which
includes
the
sec,
is
subject
to
a
criminal
offense
under
title
18.
so
we
have
this
interlocking,
connected,
nested
series
of
provisions
that
deals
with
each
of
the
concerns
identified
by
congress
in
an
industry-specific
fashion.
and
at
no
point
did
congress
suggest,
intimate,
hint,
that,
oh,
by
regulating
these
things,
the
lawyers,
the
accountants,
the
securities
analysts
and
the
public
companies,
that
they
also
were
going
to
sweep
in
6
million
private
employers.
and
if
a
member
of
congress,
i
would
submit,
had
stood
up
on
the
floor
and
suggested
that,
it
would
have
been
met
with
debate,
derision,
and
defeat.
the
first
circuit's
judgment,
your
honors,
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
