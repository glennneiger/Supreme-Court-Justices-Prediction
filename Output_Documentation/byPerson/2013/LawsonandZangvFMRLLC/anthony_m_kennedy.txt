justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
one
of
the
limitations
in
the
statute
where
it
says,
in
sub
(1),
"to
provide
information
relating
to
fraud
against
shareholders?
"
do
you
think
〝
shareholders
″
means
just
the
shareholders
of
the
public
company
or
does
it
mean
shareholders
of
the
--
suppose
you
have
an
accountant
which
has
shareholders
in
it.
and
there
is
a
fraud
with
the
accounting
firm
and
it
hurts
the
shareholders
of
the
accounting
firm,
but
not
the
company
that's
registered.
does
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
shareholders
--
in
other
words,
does
〝
shareholder
″
apply
just
to
the
publicly
registered
company?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
think
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
〝
fraud
against
shareholders
″
just
modifies
the
last
clause
or
any
provision
of
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
--
you
say
this
is
--
this
is
a
mainstream
application.
we
still
have
to
give
a
rule.
do
we
write
in
the
opinion,
this
is
a
mainstream
application
case
and
therefore
it
is
so
confined?
that
--
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that
was
your
second
point.
your
first
point
was
just
talk
about
the
mainstream
in
this
case
and
leave
other
cases.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
that
and
interpret
the
statute.
that's
what
i'm
asking.
your
statutory
interpretation
rule
to
keep
this
the
mainstream
is
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that
and
i
--
i
think
that's
a
plausible
reading.
i
don't
see
how
it's
confined
to
so-called
mainstream,
which
is
what
we
were
talking
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
fraud
under
1343?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
was
that
what
the
fraud
was
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
language
did
talk
about
arthur
andersen
and
enron.
