justice
elena
kagan
mr.
schnapper,
that's
the
position
that
the
sec
took
in
its
amicus
brief
to
the
first
circuit.
it
said
section
806
applies
where
employees
of
the
contractor
are
reporting
possible
violations
of
law
by
the
public
company
for
which
the
contractor
is
performing
work.
so
it
did
put
a
limitation
on
the
kinds
that
justice
breyer
has
suggested.
in
other
words,
yes,
employees
of
the
contractor,
but
only
when
the
employees
are
engaged,
you
know,
only
when
the
violations
of
law
that
the
employee
is
reporting
relates
to
the
work
that
the
contractor
is
doing
for
the
publicly
held
company.
do
you
think
that
that's
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute
or
not?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
saharsky,
if
i
could
take
you
back
to
second.
〝
contractor
of
such
company
″,
you're
saying
we
can
read
that
to
impose
a
limitation,
that
it's
--
it's
not
anything
that
the
contractor
does
in
any
capacity
for
anybody,
whether
relating
to
the
contract
or
not.
we
could
instead
read
it
as,
you
know,
〝
the
contractor
″
means
the
--
the
entity
doing
a
particular
contract
for
a
particular
public
company;
is
that
correct?
do
i
get
that?
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
inherent
in
the
--
in
the
word〝
contractor
″
or
in
the
phrase
〝
contractor
of
such
company
″
is
a
sort
of
status
of
a
company,
and
that
one
should
not
read
this
statute
as
applying
outside
that
particular
status.
