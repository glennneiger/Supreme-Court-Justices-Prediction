all
employees
or
would
you
limit
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
ones
that
had
a
hand
in
executing
the
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
came
up.
i
mean,
we
are
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
and
this
spinner
case
from
the
arb
postdates.
we
have
a
district
court,
a
court
of
appeals.
chevron
didn't
raise
its
head
until
after
the
first
circuit
was
through
with
the
case.
so
how
does
chevron
come
into
this
particular
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
an
accountant
be
a
contractor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
--
but
the
bottom
line
of
your
argument
mr.
perry,
is
that
the
whistleblower
who
is
working
for
the
accountant
--
you
say
there
are
separate
provisions
that
deal
with
the
accounting
firm
and
the
law
firm.
but
the
whistleblower
who
wants
to
disclose
what
nefarious
thing
is
going
on
would
have
no
protection
against
retaliation
by
the
accounting
firm
or,
if
it's
a
law
firm,
the
law
firm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
answer
to
my
question
is
right,
they
wouldn't
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
whistleblower
claim
against
the
accounting
firm
or
the
law
firm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
you
told
me
that
congress
didn't
provide
for
the
whistleblower,
but
it
allowed
the
agency
to
do
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apparently,
that's
not
the
view
of
the
sec
because
i
think
they
are
--
they
are
represented
by
the
government.
and
the
sec
apparently
takes
the
view
that
this
provision
does
cover
contractors.
it
covers
lawyers
who
couldn't
be
contractors
and
accountants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
lot
like
the
dissent
in
the
first
circuit.
