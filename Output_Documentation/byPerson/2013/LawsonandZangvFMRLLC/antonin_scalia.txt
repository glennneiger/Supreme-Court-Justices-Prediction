justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
sort
of
peculiar.
i
mean,
really,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
piece
it
out
like
that,
that
it
includes
employees
of
contractors,
subcontractors,
but
not
--
not
of
any
officer.
but
let
me
ask
you
this:
if
it
does
include
employees
of
--
of
an
officer,
is
it
--
is
it
as
much
of
a
disaster
as
--
as
your
opponent
suggests?
that
is
to
say,
would
--
would
a
firing
for
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
securities
laws
be
swept
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
limited
to
those
subjects.
and
is
--
is
the
personal
employee
of
an
officer
likely
to
be
involved
with
any
of
those
subjects?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
also
rules
out
the
accounting
firm
that
is
only
used
once,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
just
hire
them
for
this
one
audit;
are
they
a
contractor?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure.
does
that
mean
yes
or
no
to
his
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
is
it
a
possible
reading?
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
--
but
i
think
you're
--
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
--
that
we
don't
have
to
get
into
these
--
these
other
situations,
because
to
my
mind,
the
principal
argument
made
by
the
respondent
is
if
you
read
the
statute
literally
the
way
you
like,
it
covers
a
wide
range
of
things
that
--
that
one
would
have
no
reason
to
believe
congress
wanted
to
cover.
and
unless
you
come
up
with
some
--
with
some
limiting
principle
that
--
that
eliminates
that
argument,
i'm
not
inclined
to
go
along
with
your
--
your
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute.
so,
i
at
least
do
have
to
grapple
with
--
with
whether
there
are
limitations,
with
--
with
what
is
--
what
is
the
central
mainstream
of
the
statute
and
--
and
what
is
outside
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
the
petitioner's
position,
however.
the
petitioner
takes
a
broader
--
a
broader
interpretation
as
i
understood
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
post-legislative
history,
which
we
usually
don't
pay
attention
to.
the
--
the
problem
that
i
have
is
if
--
if
the
statute
does
not
cover
contractors',
subcontractors',
firing
of
their
own
people,
what
--
what
coverage
does
it
have?
a
subcontractor
usually
cannot
fire
somebody
from
the
principal
company
that's
traded
on
the
exchange.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
it
can
harass
or
threaten
either
if
it's
--
if
it's
an
employee
of
another
company--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
it
has
no
power
to
fire.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you're
--
you're
eliminating
the
--
the
principal
contractors
who
might
have
that
kind
of
power.
you
say
they're
not
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
by
accountants
and
lawyers.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
so
if
--
if
accountants
and
lawyers
are
not
--
are
not
contractors?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean
that
they're
not
regulated
as
contractors
here?
unless
it
means
that
contractor
here
does
not
include
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
sensible
limitation.
unfortunately,
it's
not
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you
would
say
that
that
rulemaking
would
be
ultra
vires,
if
it
took
the
position
that
the
government's
taking
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
they
did
and
they
came
out
with
a
rule
that
reads
just
the
way
the
government
presented
it
today,
you
would
say
that
that
is
an
unreasonable
reading
of
the
statute,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
was
it,
counsel?
[laughter]
