mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1514a
is
written
in
the
classic
language
which
congress
utilizes
to
regulate
relationships
between
employees
and
their
employers.
legislation
regarding
how
an
entity
is
to
treat
an
employee
is
understood
to
refer
to
the
entity's
own
employees.
and
that
is
particularly
true
here
where
the
phrase
″
terms
and
conditions
″
of
employment
is
used
in
the
statute.
if
section
1514a
forbade
only
contractors
to
retaliate
against
employees
under
the
terms
and
conditions
of
their
employment,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
question
that
the
courts
would
understand
it
was
referring
to
the
contractor's
own
employees.
the
statute
has
the
same
--
that
language
has
the
same
meaning,
even
though
it's
combined
in
this
instance
with
prohibitions
against
retaliation
by
other
types
of
actors.
the
first
circuit's
decision
interpreting
1514a
to
permit
a
contractor
to
retaliate
against
its
own
employees
is
inconsistent
with
its
general
usage
and
it
leads
to
four
implausible
consequences.
first,
it
renders
the
statutory
language
regarding
contractors
virtually
meaningless.
secondly,
it
renders
that
language
with
regard
to
contractors
in
the
mutual
fund
industry
literally
meaningless.
third,
it
has
the
implausible
consequence
of
permitting
the
very
type
of
retaliation
that
we
know
congress
was
concerned
about.
retaliation
by
an
accountant
such
as
arthur
andersen.
and
finally,
it
renders
incoherent
the
provisions
in
1514a
and
the
related
remedial
provision
regarding
scienter,
the
burden
of
proof
and
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'm
not
--
it's
our
position
that
employees
of
contractors
and
subcontractors
are
covered.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--we
--
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
we
--
we
have
not
taken
a
position
and
the
standard
we
advanced
does
not
address
the
question
of
a
--
of
a
personal
employee
of
an
employer,
such
as
ken
lay--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it
doesn't
raise
distinct
issues--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
our
view
of
this
is
that
the
--
the
meaning
of
the
term
〝
employee
″
depends
on
the
context
in
which
it's
used
and
it
ought
to
be
assessed
separately
for
each
of
the
actors.
so
when
it
says
no
publicly-traded
company
may
retaliate
against
an
employee,
it
means
an
employee
of
the
publicly-traded
company.
but
--
and
the
same
thing
with
contractor
and
subcontractor.
but
if
we
had
a
statute
which
by
itself
said
no
employee
of
--
personal
--
no
employee
of
an
officer
shall
do
something,
the
--
the
normal
reading
of
that
would
be
to
refer
to
an
employee
of
the
officer's
company.
and
we
have
statutes
that
impose
personal
liability
on
officials
for
things
they're
doing
in
their
companies
and
that's
the
way
they
read.
so
i--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
--
the
statute
forbids
retaliation
for
protected
activity
related
either
to
the
securities
law
or
to
certain
criminal
fraud
provisions.
and
that's
quite
deliberate.
the
statute
--
sarbanes-oxley
is
not
limited
to
corporate
misdeeds
and
related
things.
title
viii
and
title
ix
also
deal
specifically
--
deal
much
more
broadly
with
criminal
fraud.
title
ix
increases
the
penalty
for
wire
fraud
and
mail
fraud
without
regard
to
whether
it
has
--
it
was
by
a
corporation
or
an
individual.
mr.
eric
schnapper
so
this
is
also
an
antifraud
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
your
honor.
they're
unlikely
to
know
of
such
things.
but
--
but
the
congress
deliberately
wrote
the
statute
to
deal
with
ordinary
wire
and
mail
fraud,
not
just
corporate
public
company
related
fraud.
the
statute
is
broader
in
that
regard.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
i
understand,
i
understand.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
there
are
two
relevant
limitations
here,
one
of
them
statutory
and
one
of
them
practical.
the
statutory
one
is
that,
although
it
wouldn't
deal
with,
i
think,
the
situation
you
hypothesized,
that
the
counterparty,
so
to
speak,
of
the
public
company
is
described
as
a
contractor.
and
we
think
that
is
not
anyone
who
has
ever
had
a
contract
with
a
public
company.
〝
contractor
″
in
the
ordinary
parlance
refers
to
an
ongoing
relationship.
the
paradigm
is
someone
providing
services
on
an
ongoing
basis,
which
of
course
fits
lawyers
and
accountants
perfectly.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
so
if
someone
from
a
private
firm
goes
down
to
walmart,
buys
a
box
of
rubber
bands,
that
in
ordinary
parlance
wouldn't
be
referred
to
as
a
contractor.
so
we
think
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
rules
out
most
mom
and
pop
stores.
they
don't
have
that
kind
of
relationship.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
would
have
to
be
very
fast.
i
mean,
i
think
an
audit
takes
some
time.
but
if
you
have
someone
come
in
for--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
an
audit
takes
long
enough
that
they
would
be.
it's
not
like
the
moment
that
it
takes
to
buy
something
at
the
gift
shop
downstairs.
i
think
it
typically
takes
weeks
if
not
months,
and
i
think
in
ordinary
parlance
you
would
call
someone
a
contractor
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
the
way
the
congress
wrote
the
statute,
and
we
think
for
two
kinds
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
that
--
the
statute
is
also
about,
as
you
put
it,
garden
variety
fraud.
it's
increased
the
penalty
for
wire
fraud,
for
mail
fraud.
for
the
first
time
there
is
a
provision
for
attempts
and
conspiracy.
it
is
an
antifraud
statute
in
addition
to
dealing
with
the
enron
issues.
so
we
think
that's
deliberate.
secondly,
your
honor,
although--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i'd
have
to
remember
the
exact
question.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
statute
isn't
written
that
way.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it's
certainly
possible.
we
think
it's
not
the
correct
reading.
and
there's
a--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it's
a
possible
reading,
but
we
think
it's
not
the
correct
reading.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
yes,
we
are.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'm
not
sure
i
want
to
go
down
the
road.
that's
not
--
that's
not
our
view.
i
don't
want
to
pick
a
fight
with
the
government.
mr.
eric
schnapper
as
i
said,
we
think
that's
--
we
think
that's
not
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
another
one
that
we
think
it
unlikely,
over
and
above
the
fact
that
congress
was
concerned
with
fraud
generally,
was
that
i
think
congress
would
have
been
reluctant
to
try
to
define
what
was
sufficiently
related
to
the
corporation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
justice
alito,
i
think
that's
just
the
way
they
wrote
the
statute.
they
were
concerned
with
all
fraud,
but
they
didn't
extend
the
whistleblowers
to
all
fraud.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
this
is
sort
of
a
hybrid
piece
of
legislation
dealing
with
corporate
problems
and
fraud,
and
they
kind
of
melded
the
two
here.
but
i
think
there
are
--
it's
also
important
in
this
situation
to
bear
in
mind
the
following:
i
think
congress
would
have
--
was
reluctant
--
it
didn't
itself
draw
a
line
because
the
experience
of
the
enron
scandal
was
that
all
sorts
of
terribly
complicated
arrangements
had
been
drawn
up
between
enron
and
these
hundreds
of
off-the-books
entities,
jedi,
raptors,
ljm,
and
the
like.
i
think
congress
correctly
concluded
that
if
it
tried
to
write
out
a
description
of
what
else
it
was
covering,
someone
would
think
of
a
way
to
get
around
it.
and
i
think
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
contemplated
that
federal
courts
were
to
try
to
untangle
these
relationships
to
the
point
where
they
could
figure
out
whether,
for
example,
if
andrew
fastow
was
skimming
off
money
from
chewco,
whether
that
would
be
sufficiently
related
to
enron.
it's
just,
it's
enormously
complicated
and
i
think
congress
didn't
mean
to
open
the
door
to
that.
and
that's
brought
home
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
written
more
broadly
than
air-21.
it's
essentially
modeled
on
air-21,
which
is
a
statute
adopted
a
couple
years
earlier
about
whistleblowing
in
the
airline
industry,
particularly
with
regard
to
safety
work.
in
that
statute,
〝
contractor
″
is
specifically
defined
to
mean
an
airline
contractor
dealing
with
safety.
they
did
not
put
that
kind
of
limitation
here,
and
i
think
it,
in
part,
because
it
simply
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
do.
and
i
don't
think
they
meant
to
give
the
courts
a
commission
to
try
to
sort
that
sort
of
thing
out.
the
core
problem
with
the
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
it
really
renders
almost
meaningless
the
decision
of
congress
to
prohibit
retaliation
by
contractors
and
subcontractors.
contractors
and
subcontractors
would
rarely
be
in
a
position
to
engage
in
retaliation,
but
particularly
to
engage
in
the
very
specific
kind
of
retaliation
specified
in
the
statute,
retaliation
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's
a--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
but
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
so.
but
this
clause
in
the
alternative,
it
--
it's
--
a
report
would
be
protected
if
it
involves
a
violation
of
1341
or
1334
and
8,
which
aren't
limited
to
shareholders.
the
words--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes,
it
modifies
the
last
clause,
exactly.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
begin
by
just
referring
the
court
to
some
materials
that
might
be
relevant
to
some
of
the
questions
you
asked.
with
regard
to
the
sec's
view
prior
to
this
case
coming
to
this
court,
those
views
were
expressed
in
a
separate
brief
the
sec
filed
in
the
first
circuit,
which
is
consistent
with
the
government's
approach
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
agree
with
that,
but
--
but
the
question
came
up
about
what
their
views
were.
with
regard
to
the
suggestion
earlier
that
the
arb
has
taken
the
position
that
every
contract
--
every
firm
that
has
a
contract
with
a
public
company
is
a
contractor.
actually,
in
the
fleszar
case,
which
is
mentioned
in
both
the
respondent's
brief
and
our
yellow
brief,
the
--
the
arb
is
for
the
opposite
position
and
--
and
took
a
position,
i
think,
consistent
with
the
view
we've
advanced,
which
is
not
every
contract
renders
you
a
contractor.
with
regard
to
arthur
andersen,
the
discussion
in
the
senate
report
about
why
there's
a
need
to
deal
with
retaliation
is
repeatedly
about
arthur
andersen.
many
of
the
people
who
actually
understood
what
was
going
on
at
--
at
enron
were
arthur
andersen
employees,
not
most
of
the
run-of-the-mill
employees
at
enron,
and
they
were
the
ones
who
remained
silent
in
the
face
of
this
very,
very
serious
problem.
with
regard
to
the
origins
of
this
phrase
contractor,
my
brother,
mr.
perry,
was
right,
it
comes
from
air-21.
the
preliminary
air-21
regulations
regarding
what
it
means
were
issued
prior
to
the
adoption
of
sox
and
they
said
it
included
employers
--
employees
of
employers,
which
has
remained
the
view
of
the
agency
throughout.
my
colleague
--
with
regard
to
air-21,
the
history
here
is,
i
think,
important.
this
statute
referred
to
air
carriers
and
contractors
and
subcontractors,
and
the
court
below
assumed
that
that
meant
that
employees
of
subcontractors
and
contractors
were
covered.
the
first
circuit's
theory
was
that
congress
meant
to
narrow
the
meaning
of
contractor
employees
because
it
added
retaliation
by
officers
and
employees.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
precisely
the
wrong
conclusion.
when
congress
added
to
the
entities
that
could
not
retaliate,
when
it
rewrote
air-21
to
add
some
other
people
that
couldn't
retaliate,
it
didn't
mean
to
tacitly
then
eliminate
the
employees
of
contractors
who
were
governed
under
air-21.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
question
the
court
has
raised
about
whether
it
should
explore
the
possibility
of
a
limitation
based
on
whether
a
contractor
was
acting
as
a
contractor,
we
think
it
would
probably
not
be
prudent
to
take
that
on
at
this
time
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
a
fair
amount
of
work
that
was
done
by
arthur
andersen
was
not
--
that
was
relevant
wasn't
done
for
enron.
it
was
done
for
the
off-the-books
enterprises.
they
did
$5.7
million
of
accounting
work
for
jedi,
where
the
debts
--
one
of
the
places
where
the
debts
were
being
hidden.
so
you
--
you'd
get
into
that
problem.
secondly,
this
provision
is
adopted
against
the
background
of
a
series
of
executive
orders,
most
important
which
is
executive
order
11246,
about
racial
discrimination
by
federal
contractors.
that
executive
order
has
always
been
understood
to
cover
all
the
employees
of
the
contractor,
not
just
the
employees
who
are
working
on
the
government
project.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
part
of
the
background.
congress
has
not
tried
to
--
the
executive
branch
hasn't
limited
it
to
that.
and
in
the
civil
rights
restoration
act
of
about
1986,
congress
rewrote
title
6
and
title
9
to
have
institution-wide
application
rather
than
to
do
little
parts
of
it.
this
issue
about
what
a
contractor
might
be
doing
as
a
contractor
hasn't
been
vetted
in
lower
courts
and
we
think
it
would
be
not
prudent
to
try
to
--
to
take
that
on
here.
thank
you
very
much.
