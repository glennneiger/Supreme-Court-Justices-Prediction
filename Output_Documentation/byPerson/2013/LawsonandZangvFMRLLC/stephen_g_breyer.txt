justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
limitation?
that
is,
if
the
argument
against
throwing
the
contractors
in
the
way
you
want,
i
think
is,
well,
then
there
is
no
limitation.
so
a
company
that
let's
say
is
a
publicly
traded
company,
they
have
a
building
and
they
hire
a
gardener.
and
the
gardener
is
a
gardening
company
and
it
has
three
employees
and
it
works
one
day
a
week
cutting
their
lawn
and
it
works
four
days
a
week
cutting
somebody
else's
lawn.
is
the
mail
fraud
--
and
then
they
fire
one
of
the
three
employees,
or
two.
and
he
gets
annoyed
and
says
it
was
because
of
fraud.
now,
the
fraud
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
company
that
they're
cutting
the
lawn
for.
it
has
to
do
with
some
other
customers.
all
right.
so
what
--
how
--
i
don't
think
the
statute
intends
to
get
that.
does
it
want
to
make
every
mom
and
pop
shop
in
the
country,
when
they
have
one
employee,
suddenly
subject
to
the
whistleblower
protection
for
any
fraud,
even
those
frauds
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
publicly
traded
company?
this
is
not
really
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
trying
to
foresee
is
are
you
arguing
for
no
limitation
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
limit
it
as
also
ruling
out
frauds
by
companies
that
are
not
publicly
traded
themselves
of
course,
but
where
the
fraud
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract?
that
is,
the
whole
activity
just
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract.
it's
just
chance
that
they
happen
to
have
a
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
rule
out
frauds
where
the
fraud
at
issue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't
written
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
road
is
when
you
see
a
statute
that
says
〝
any
policeman
″,
they
don't
mean
a
policeman
on
mars,
nor
are
they
likely
to
mean
a
policeman
in
europe.
the
〝
any
policeman
″
is
likely,
although
it
says
〝
any
policeman
″,
to
mean
a
policeman
in
the
united
states.
and
similarly
where
they
talk
about
this,
the
contractors,
they
don't
mean
frauds
related
to
--
you
have
to
use
some
kind
of
scope
for
the
word
--
for
the
kinds
of
frauds
that
are
included
in
the
statute,
and
you
have
to
read
that
into
language
that
says
nothing
about
it.
and
that's
--
i
don't
say
that
that
is
necessarily
easy
to
do
and
that's
why
i
started
with
my
first
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
argument
about
this,
the
reason
that
we're
--
that
i've
brought
this
up
is
--
is
because
i
think
that
the
strongest
argument
in
those
courts
of
appeals
that
kind
of
held
against
you
is
that
they
fear
that
otherwise
this
statute
would
create
any
fraud
by
any
gardener,
any
cook,
anybody
that
had
one
employee
in
the
entire
united
states
and
engaged
in
any
alleged
fraud
would
be
covered.
but
it
seems
to
me
there
are
many
ways
to
skin
that
cat.
and
--
and
one
way
that
i
suggested
and
now
mr.
schnapper
said,
no,
that's
--
that
kind
of
thing
related
to
the
contract
isn't
going
to
work
very
well
because
it's
too
complicated
to
try
to
figure
out.
so
maybe
we
don't
have
to
figure
it
out
in
this
case.
i
mean
that's
possible.
i
--
i
just
wanted
a
universe
of
possibilities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
isn't
the
sec
--
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you're
ready
to
go
through
this,
i'd
appreciate
your
telling
in
your
opinion
--
what
the
statute
says,
taking
the
extraneous
words
out,
is
that
no
contractor
of
a
publicly-traded
company
may
discharge,
demote,
et
cetera,
any
employee
because
of
his
lawful
act
in
reporting
a
fraud.
that's
what
it
says.
so,
what
did
they
have
in
mind
if
they
didn't
have
in
mind
forbidding
any
contractor
of
a
publicly-traded
company
from
a
contractor
--
and,
you
know,
maybe
there
are
limitations
there
--
but
a
contractor
from
demoting
an
employee
because
of
his
lawful
act
reporting
a
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
any
--
i
just
eliminated
the
extraneous
words
and
instead
of
the
not
the
word
〝
such
″,
i
put
in
what
〝
such
″
refers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
all
they're
interested
in
here,
you
say,
is
this
workout
contractor,
but
not
for
example
where
you
have
a
fund
which
has
virtually
no
employees
and
does
all
its
work
really
through
investment
advisors
such
as
here,
and
you
think
congress
didn't
want
to
include
the
investment
advisor
firing
its
whistleblower
even
if
it's
directly
related
to
the
fraud,
hot
fund
and
everything
else,
but
it
did
just
want
to
include
the
people
who
--
who
are
there
because
the
contractor
is
a
workout
firm,
and
--
and
not
the
investment
advisor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
all
that's
a
conceivable
reading,
i
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
is
it
that
leads
you
to
that
conclusion
other
than--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
right
on
that.
i
mean,
it
is
correct
that
that's
what
they
talk
about.
and
so
that
sends
us
on
a
search
for
limitation.
you
have
one
limitation.
your
limitation
says
the
person
who
is
dismissed
has
to
be
an
employee
of
the
publicly-traded
company.
now,
the
government,
and
--
and
even
your
--
mr.
schnapper
has
come
up
with
accepting
some
limitations.
there
are
possibly
others.
one
would
be
on
the
nature
of
the
contractor,
which
you
want
to
do,
but
it
would
be
somewhat
broader
than
yours.
another,
possibly,
is
on
the
nature
of
the
fraud.
is
it
related
to
the
contract?
another
might
be
the
one
the
district
court
proposed,
and
there
could
be
others.
so
i
think
if
you
want
to
say
anything
about
this,
it
seems
to
me
that
taking
as
given
--
i
will
for
argument's
sake
anyway
--
say
all
the
legislative
history
is
about
publicly-traded
companies.
and
i
do
look
at
it.
but
nonetheless,
they
did
use
this
language
in
their
other
possible
limitations
that
would
serve
the
same
purpose.
then
you
say
to
that,
saying
yours
is
the
best,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that
itself
is
a
big
limitation.
huge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
that
today.
and
--
and
if,
in
fact,
the
fraud
is
related
to
the
contract
or
by
certain
kinds
of
contractors
who
do
investment
work,
who
do
all
kinds
of
important
work
for
the
company,
why
shouldn't
it
be
covered?
i
mean,
and
the
language,
of
course,
does
say
what
i
read,
as
you
agreed.
it
says
a
contractor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
may
be
that
you
have
a
good
point,
that
it's
the
sec
we
should
defer
to
and
not
the
labor
department.
but
then,
as
was
pointed
out,
fine,
then
you're
going
to
have
that
rulemaking
and
given
their
position
here,
it
looks
as
if
they
will
hold
something
you
don't
like.
but
--
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
--
we
may
have
to
get
to
this.
i
thought
section
3(a)
of
sarbanes-oxley
--
that's
what
we
found
here.
quote,
"the
securities
and
exchange
commission
shall
promulgate
such
rules
and
regulations
as
may
be
necessary
and
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
or
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
in
furtherance
of
this
act.
"
so
why
doesn't
that
delegate
right
to
the
sec
the
power
to
interpret
the
general
provisions
of
the
section
802?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
we
should
interpret
that
provision
since
no
one
has
briefed,
given
--
on
that
basis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
did
it
come
from?
that
is,
where
did
the
words
〝
contractor
″?
some
human
being
wrote
them
for
the
first
time.
you
probably
know
who
did
and
where
and
under
what
circumstances.
what?
what,
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
of
us
are
interested
in
that.
at
least
i
am.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
so
who
is
the
human
being
who
wrote
them
and
what
did
he
have
in
mind,
or
she?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
go
back
to
the
hearings.
i
mean,
there
might
have
been
hearings.
