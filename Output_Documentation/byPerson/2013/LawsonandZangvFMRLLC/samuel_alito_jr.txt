justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
your
position
that
employees
of
any
officer,
employee,
contractor,
subcontractor
or
agent
of
a
public
company
are
covered?
they're
all
covered?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
doesn't--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
it
doesn't
include
that,
then
--
then
how
do
you
avoid
that
with
your
reading
of
the
text?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
which
gets
at
this
point
where
you
have
the
gardening
--
the
gardening
company,
privately
held,
that's
working
for
a
public
company,
and
there's
some
kind
of
employee
of
the
contractor
is
fired
and
claims
that
the
company
is
engaging
in
some
kind
of
fraud
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
company.
so
you
have
that
situation.
now
you
have
the
identical,
another
privately
held
gardening
company,
exactly
the
same
thing
is
going
on,
except
they
don't
have
a
contract
with
a
public
company.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
cover
the
former
and
not
the
latter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why?
if
they
are
concerned
with
all
fraud,
why
not
cover
them
both?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
--
it's
not
unlikely
that
an
employee
of
a
subcontractor
will
have
information
about
something
that
can
be
--
that
can
be
alleged
to
be
mail
fraud
by
that
--
by
the
contractor,
that's
not
at
all
unlikely.
if
you
see
--
you
know,
if
you
see
some
civil
rico
complaints,
you
see
the
kind
of
things
that
are
alleged
as
mail
fraud.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
but
you
think
this
is
limited
to
--
to
fraud
by
the
contractor
relating
to
the
public
company,
not
--
not
fraud
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
company.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
while?
temporal
--
during
the
same
period
of
time
or
in
relation
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
where
do
you
see
that
in
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
says,
〝
the
contractor
of
such
company
″,
not
〝
the
fraud
of
such
company
″.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
if
another
enron
situation
comes
along
and
the
corporation's
accounting
firm
retaliates
against
an
employee
of
the
accounting
firm
because
that
employee
wants
to
report
illegal
activity
by
the
corporation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
the
statute
says
is
〝
any
conduct
″,
"any
conduct
which
the
employee
reasonably
believes
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
1341,
'43,
'44,
or
'48.
"
do
you
see
in
there
any
limitation
that
says
that
the
conduct
has
to
be
fraudulent
conduct
relating
to
the
activities
of
a
publicly
held
company.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
gives
the
reference
to
the
subcontractors
or
to
contractors
and
the
subcontractors
such
a
narrow
meaning.
and
except
for
this
concept
of
the
axe-wielding
specialist,
those
provisions
mean
nothing
under
that.
that's
what
gives
me
pause
about
your
interpretation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
my
question
wasn't
clear.
if
you
say
that
the
employees,
only
the
employee
of
the
publicly
held
company
and
not
the
employee
of
the
private
--
privately
held
subcontractor,
then
that
--
the
only
situation
is
covered
with
respect
to
the
contractor
is
this
so-called
axe-wielding
specialist.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
it
can
happen,
but
it's
really
very
small,
isn't
it?
