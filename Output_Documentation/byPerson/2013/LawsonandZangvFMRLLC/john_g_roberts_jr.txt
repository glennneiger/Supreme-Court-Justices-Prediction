we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-3,
lawson
and
zang
v.
fmr
llc.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
even
though
it
delegated
rulemaking
authority
to
a
different
agency,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
sec
has
no
rulemaking
authority
that
would
cover
this
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
arb's
decisions,
they
said
that
they
were
bound
by
osha's
interpretation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
osha
made
it
quite
clear
in
its
interpretation
that
it
--
and
its
rule
that
it
had
no
authority
to
issue
statutory
interpretations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
should
ignore
the
part
where
it
said
it's
bound
by
osha's
interpretation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
perry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
arb?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
those
--
that's
an
easy
hypothetical.
what
about
the
butler
who
does,
in
fact,
hear
all
this
information
about
a
conspiracy
and
wire
fraud?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schnapper,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
know
they
don't
have
rulemaking
authority
in
this
area.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
