justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
far
do
you
want
to
go
in
your
concession?
would
you
want
to
concede
this
point
that
imagine
the
state
has
two
groups
of
people
and
one
group
feels
what
the
other
is
doing
is
terribly
wrong.
and
the
second
group
feels,
we
absolutely
want
to
do
it.
and
everyone
is
in
a
fragile
state
of
mind,
and
they
want
to,
if
possible,
at
least
one
group
wants
to
sort
of
shout
as
loud
as
you
could
at
the
other,
please
don't
do
this.
and
the
other
says,
please
leave
me
alone.
and
we
are
not
saying
which
group
is
which;
the
analogy
is
obvious,
but
i
keep
all
the
titles
out.
does
the
state
have
the
right,
in
your
opinion,
to
say,
it's
tough
to
referee
this,
we
see
the
potential
for
real
harm
on
one
side
or
the
other,
so
we're
going
to
have
this
kind
of
35-foot
boundary?
you
want
to
concede
that
and
say,
okay,
but
the
evidence
here
didn't
doesn't
justify
it,
or
do
you
want
to
fight
that,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
you
are
into
the
details.
i
want
to
know
about
the
principle.
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
the
principle
applying
special
care
and
need
must
be
taken
outside
of
hospitals
for
veterans,
even
though
there
are
some
who
are
very
much
opposed
to
the
war,
because
these
people
will
be
coming
out,
they'll
be
in
wheelchairs,
it
will
be
terrible.
and
others
thinking
--
you
know,
we
can
think
of
many,
many
situations,
irrespective
subject
matter,
where
there
is
a
need
for
such
refereeing.
and
i
just
want
to
know
if
the
--
if
the
concept
is
okay
with
you
or
if
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
the
details.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
now
why
i
am
trying
to
narrow
it?
because
in
my
case,
in
schneider,
i
thought
it
was
pretty
important
that
the
demonstrators
were
behind
a
hill
somewhere
and
the
police
restricted
where
they
could
go.
many
states
have
enacted
similar
laws,
and
i
thought
that's
important,
because
maybe
it
would
have
come
out
differently.
i
mean,
you
could
argue
about
it,
and
i
could.
so
i'm
trying
to
narrow
it.
i'm
trying
to
see
to
what
extent
do
i
have
to
look
at
this
particular
set
of
facts,
in
which
case
we
are
into
the
hearings,
et
cetera;
and
to
what
extent
is
there
a
matter
of
very
broad
principle
here,
and
any
help
you
can
give
me
on
that
would
be
appreciated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
that
--
now,
at
this
point
--
that
was
a
better
way
of
getting
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
just
assume
that
there
is
--
let's
look
at
the
narrow
part
of
the
case,
and
let's
assume
that
the
colorado
case
is
right.
and
this
particular
restriction
is
more
a
restrictive
than
colorado
in
two
important
respects,
which
you've
gone
into.
now,
the
reason
that
they
did
that
is
they
had
hearings
in
massachusetts,
and
they
discovered
that
the
colorado
law
didn't
really
work
very
well.
and
so,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
are
we
supposed
to
now
go
look
at
--
as
long
as
those
hearings
are
--
are
legitimate
hearings
and
they
have
good
explanation
on
something
like
whether
the
zone
is
8
feet
and
consensual
or
whether
it's
35
feet
and
different
amounts
of
sidewalk,
depending
on
the
nearness
of
the
facility,
when
doesn't
it
become
just
up
to
them?
we
can't
--
we're
not
legislators.
we
don't
know
the
situation
in
massachusetts.
we
can
insist
upon
a
reasonable
record.
but
how
can
we
do
more
than
that
on
this
detail?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
understand
that.
we
all
understand
that.
it's
one
thing
to
try
to
prove
an
intent
on
such
matters,
particularly
when
people
are,
in
good
faith,
they're
trying
to
explain
it,
and
it's
another
thing
to
actually
stop
the
congestion
and
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
woman
who
wants
to
have
the
abortion,
may
be
in
a
fragile
state
of
mind,
and
this
kind
of
thing
could
interfere
with
her
health,
et
cetera.
so
there
are
two
interests,
one
on
each
side.
we
know
8
feet
with
the
bubble
is
okay.
we're
not
sure
about
35
feet,
and
they
have
an
evidentiary
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
just
asked
you
that
question.
it
just
happens
that
the
police
testify
with
some
evidence
and
examples
that
the
8-foot
bubble
doesn't
work.
and
it
also
--
they
have
some
evidence
and
reasons
for
thinking
that
if
you
want
to
have
a
conversation,
you
have
to
convince
the
woman
to
walk
10
feet.
i
mean,
the
difference
is
about
half
--
you
know,
if
you
were
near
me,
price
is
near
colorado.
if
we're
over
to
where
the
first
row
is,
we'd
have
massachusetts,
and
--
and
they
have
some
evidence
that
we
can't
enforce
this
colorado
thing
very
well;
it
doesn't
help.
now,
go
ahead.
i
want
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
trying
to
put
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'd
hear
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
denying
the
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
asking
you,
we've
now
heard
different
characterizations
of
the
record.
i
didn't
mean
to
characterize
it.
i
want
you
to
explain
what
it
is
in
the
record,
from
your
point
of
view
or
lack
thereof,
that
means
that
the
constitution
intervenes
to
prevent
massachusetts
from
doing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
just
like
you
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
for
one
second.
i
didn't
hear
the
--
as
he
was
saying
that
this
case
is
not
a
protest
case,
it's
simply
about
calm
conversations.
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
if
the
evidence
showed
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the
evidence
upon
which
massachusetts
based
its
decision
to
go
to
35
feet
instead
of
8
feet.
there
were
hearings.
did
the
evidence
show
that
what
was
involved
was
calm
conversations
between
one
person
trying
to
counsel
another
or
did
the
evidence
show
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather
--
i
note
there's
some
people
who
are
peaceful,
in
which
case
i
would
accept
justice
scalia's
suggestion
this
is
a
counseling
case.
but
you've
cited
some
other
evidence
that
suggests
there
were
other
people
who
were
screaming,
pushing
and
shouting,
which
sounds
like,
in
his
characterization,
a
protest
case.
and
the
reason
that
massachusetts
found
it
difficult
to
write
a
statute
that
distinguishes
one
from
the
other
is?
why
do
people
write
statutes
that
sometimes
do
not
make
these
fine
distinctions?
why
did
they
in
this
instance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
have
written
such
a
statute
that
would
have
worked?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
go
to
--
go
back
for
a
second.
i
see
that.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
--
the
obvious
reason
for
a
legislator,
i
think
--
i
did
work
in
the
legislature
for
a
while
as
a
staff
member
--
that
you
don't
write
these
fine
statutes
is
they
won't
work.
they
have
too
fine
a
distinction.
the
activity
is
commingled.
the
activity
--
all
right.
now,
i
knew
you
were
just
going
to
nod
my
--
your
head
as
soon
as
i
said
that.
so
i
was
trying
to
get
you
to
say
it
in
spontaneously
if
it's
true.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
it's
just
too
tough
to
say
whether
they're
counseling
somebody
or
whether
they're
screaming
at
somebody,
whether
they're
pushing
somebody
or
whether
they're
standing
near
them
peacefully?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
i
could
turn
to
that
would
suggest
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
can't
say
yes
if
it
isn't
there,
because
i'm
going
to
ask
her
where
because
i
want
to
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
kind
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
understand
you're
saying
the
reasonableness
of
it.
[laughter]
but
go
back
to
justice
alito's
first
question.
maybe
we
can
make
some
progress
here.
the
regulation
of
labor
is
up
to
the
nlrb.
all
right.
now,
the
nlrb
does
regulate
picketing.
it
does
say
what
you
can
do
and
can't
do,
and
the
courts
have
reviewed
that.
and
you
--
what
standard
do
courts
use
when
the
nlrb
decides,
in
its
wisdom
and
expertise,
well,
the
pickets
can
go
here,
but
they
can't
go
there.
you
can
do
this,
but
you
can't
do
that.
all
of
which
have
speech
implications.
what
standard
of
review
do
the
courts
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
aware
of
any
case
--
i'm
putting
it
--
loading
it
because
--
only
because
to
show
my
ignorance
of
it
--
where
the
standard
has
differed
from
the
ordinary
apa
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
we
create
a
new
standard
for
reviewing
this
kind
of
regulation?
i
think
that's
actually
a
serious
question.
