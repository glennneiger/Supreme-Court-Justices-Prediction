mr.
mark
l
rienzi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
held
that
the
public
sidewalks
are
a
natural
and
proper
place
for
free
citizens
to
exchange
information
and
ideas,
and
for
that
reason
the
court
has
held
that
public
sidewalks
occupy
a
special
position
in
first
amendment
analysis.
if
the
massachusetts
law
at
issue
here
makes
it
a
crime
to
enter
onto
certain
public
sidewalks,
even
for
the
purpose
of
peaceful
conversation,
or
leafletting,
the
law
applies
at
abortion
clinics
throughout
the
state
on
every
hour
of
every
day
that
they
are
open,
regardless
of
the
circumstances.
massachusetts
asked
this
court
to
uphold
that
statute
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
test,
but
the
law
fails
each
aspect
of
that
test.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
narrow
tailoring.
the
state
says
the
law
is
necessary
to
protect
its
interests
in
preventing
obstruction
and
congestion.
but
the
law
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
those
interests
for
three
reasons:
first,
the
law
applies
regardless
of
whether
there's
any
threat
of
obstruction
or
congestion
at
all,
even
when
the
sidewalks
are
entirely
open
and
empty.
for
example,
mrs.
mccullen
generally
does
her
counseling
early
in
the
morning
on
tuesdays
and
wednesdays
beginning
at
7:00
o'clock
in
the
morning.
she
testified
that
she
is
sometimes
alone
when
she
does
this
counseling.
nancy
clark
testified
that
90
percent
of
the
time
that
she
is
at
the
clinic
in
worcester,
she
is
all
alone.
a
statute
that
makes
it
illegal
for
mrs.
mccullen
or
mrs.
clark
to
engage
in
peaceful,
consensual
conversation
on
a
public
sidewalk
for
fear
of
obstruction
and
congestion
is
not
narrowly
tailored.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so
i
think
the
state
is
simply
wrong
about
that
fact
for
several
reasons.
there
are
many
tools
that
the
state
either
has
in
its
current
toolbox
or
could
enact
that
would
deal
with
that
concern.
and
if
i
may
back
up
for
a
second,
i
think
there
are
really
two
different
interests
that
the
state
asserts
when
it
makes
that
argument,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
they
say
that
there
are
actual
deliberate
bad
actors.
all
right.
there
are
some
people
whom
the
state
claims
have
deliberately
violated
the
law
and
blocked
the
door
and
interfered
with
access.
and
then
secondly,
the
state
says
there
is
also
some
circumstances
where
there
are
enough
people
on
the
sidewalk
that
even
lawful,
consensual
conversation
might
accidentally
block
the
door.
i
think
those
are
actually
two
quite
different
interests,
but
there
are
tools
in
the
toolbox
to
deal
with
both
of
them.
for
example,
section
e
of
this
statute
makes
it
illegal
to
impede,
block,
obstruct
or
even
hinder
somebody's
access
to
the
clinics.
and
that
section
of
the
statute
is
not
challenged
here
and
never
has
been.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so
i
believe
the
last
cite
in
the
record
that
i'm
aware
of
is,
as
of
1997,
there
was
a
decision
in
a
previous
injunction
case
against
people
who
had
been
adjudicated
to
have
broken
rules.
there
is
a
1997
case
on
that.
to
my
knowledge,
they've
never
brought
a
case,
for
example,
under
the
federal
face
law,
which
has
been
in
existence
for
20
years.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
there
have
been
laws
against
obstruction
the
entire
time.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
and
that
was
an
injunction
against
prior
bad
actors.
that
was
not
a
face
prosecution
or
a
section
e
prosecution.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
frankly
don't
--
i
couldn't
say
that
i
know
the
last
time
it
happened.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
know
that
in
the
record
there
was
testimony
claiming
that
that
happened.
my
argument
is
simply
that
the
state
has
tools
that
are
deliberately
designed
to
deal
with
that.
and
so
the
united
states--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--yes.
and
so
to
the
extent,
what
the
state
is
saying
--
to
the
extent
the
state
is
claiming
that
there
are
deliberate
bad
actors
deliberately
blocking
the
door,
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
persuasive
argument.
there
are
police
on
the
scene,
and
if
the
police
say,
get
out
of
the
doorway,
either
the
person
moves
in
which
case
there
is
not
a
problem
anymore,
or
they
don't,
in
which
case,
intent
is
pretty
clear.
amicus
united
states
has
prosecuted,
i
think
more
than
45
cases
and
gotten
more
than
70
convictions
under
that
statute.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
and
so
i
agree
that's
the
second
part
of
the
state's
argument.
i
don't
think
this
law
is
narrowly
tailored
to
that
concern,
in
two
respects.
one,
the
law
applies
--
you
know,
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
that
the
crowds
that
the
state
is
concerned
about
happened
essentially
at
one
clinic,
one
day,
one
time
--
saturday
mornings
in
boston
--
and
when
they
happen,
there
are
video
cameras
rolling
and
police
officers
present.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
the
police
can't
simply
say,
move
out
of
the
doorway.
and
if
someone
is
in
front
of
the
doorway,
they
certainly
should
do
that.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
believe
there
are
11
or
12
clinics
in
the
state.
so
long
as
they
are
freestanding
abortion
clinics
they
fall
within
statutory
definitions.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so,
no,
i
do
not
mean
to
concede
that.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
a
solution
that
is
done
with
painted
lines
on
the
sidewalk
that
says--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--generally--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--generally
speaking,
no.
i
don't
think
the
concept
that--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so
--
so,
a
couple
points
about
that.
one--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so
i
think
that
that--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--agreed.
i
think
a
statute
that
worked
the
way
the
one
--
this
one
does
here,
that
would
make
it
illegal
to
even
engage
in
peaceful
conversation
on
sidewalks
near
a
church
or
near
a
funeral
or
near
just
about
anything
else,
i
think
clearly
is
not
permitted
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
think
it
made--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--perhaps
were
part
of
the
funeral
procession
that
passed
by.
i
don't
think
they--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so
the
matter
of
very
broad
principle
is
that
a
law
that
makes
it
illegal
to
even
engage
in
consensual
conversation,
quiet
conversation,
on
a
public
sidewalk,
an
act
that
makes
that
a
criminal
act
for
which
mrs.
mccullen
can
go
to
prison,
i
think,
is
not
permissible
under
the
first
amendment.
if
you
compare
it
to,
for
example,
the
federal
military
funeral
protest
law,
that
law
is
specifically
drawn
to
acts
that
disrupt
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
funeral,
and
i
think
that
is
different.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so,
generally
speaking,
i
think
any
law
like
that
runs
into
a
big
first
amendment
problem
of
even
eliminating
peaceful,
consensual
conversation
that
doesn't
disrupt
anything.
and
this
court's
past
first
amendment
decisions
have
said
that
precision
of
regulation
is
required.
one
difference,
if
it's
a
rule
around
any
facility
or
a
rule
around
all
funerals,
for
example,
is
that
--
that
there
isn't
nearly
as
much
distortion
of
the
marketplace
of
ideas
as
happens
when
you
do
what
massachusetts
did
here,
which
is
pick--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so
what's
wrong
with
that
is
a
couple
of
things.
one,
again,
this
court's
decisions
require
precision
of
regulation.
so
an
injunction,
for
example,
against
groups
and
individuals
like
madsen
and
schenck,
for
example,
an
injunction
against
groups
and
individuals
who
have
interfered
with
access,
keeping
them
back,
i
think
that's
perfectly
permissible.
we
take
no
issue
with
that
type
of
solution.
it's
the
generally
applicable
statute,
right,
that's
tied
to
just
one
particular
often-protested
event
that
gives
the
state
enormous
power
to
interfere
with
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
government
interest
to
--
well,
first,
i
guess,
i
don't
know
the
particulars
of
that
law
and
what
it
--
what
it
restricts.
if
it
restricts
peaceful
conversation
on
public
sidewalks
anyplace
there's
a
fraternal
lodge,
i
would
say
that
--
that
should
not
be
permissible
under
the
first
amendment.
i
think,
generally
speaking,
the
idea
of
the
government
picking
one
particular
item
and
saying,
well,
around
this,
suddenly
the
character
of
the
public
forum
changes
from
a
place
where
people
can
have
peaceful,
consensual
conversations
to
a
place
where
we
will
imprison
them
for
doing
that,
i
think
that's
a
dramatic
restriction
of
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
if
there
is
a
particular
group
or
individual
who
keeps
interfering
with
the
fraternal
order,
of
course,
you
can
get
an
injunction
against
that
type
of
behavior,
but
i
don't
think
the
state
can
say
even
peaceful
discussion
and
leafletting--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--to
be
clear,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
the
government
has
to
let
it
go
on.
i'm
saying
the
government
has
tools
that
are
better
drawn
to
it
than
eliminating
even
the
peaceful,
consensual
conversation.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
suppose
it
were
a
given
that
there
is
no
way
to
keep
the
abortion
clinic
open--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--if
the
laws
simply
do
not
work,
i
think
perhaps
the
government
could
come
in
and
make
a
case
that
it
has
a
compelling
interest
and
that
this
is
the
least
restrictive
means
of
doing
it.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so
--
so,
on
this
detail,
what
--
what
i
think
the
court
should
look
for
is,
for
example,
had
they
had
a
--
the
state
said
they
did
not
even
convict
a
single
person
of
one
unconsensual--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so,
a
few
things.
one,
the
reasons
this
court
gave
in
hill
for
allowing
the
8-foot
no-approach
zone
was
precisely
that
it
only
was
about
protecting
unwilling
listeners
and
it
did
not
stop
discussions
with
willing
listeners.
there
are
real
people--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--no,
not
at
all.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
understood
i
was
being
asked
to
assume
that.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
no.
i
--
i
agree,
it
was
not.
the
claim
was--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--i
--
i
agree,
but
if--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--if
you
sent
me
35
feet
further
back
and
asked
me
to
make
my
argument
from
there--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--you
might
hear
me,
but
i
would
suggest
you'd
--
you'd
receive
it
quite
differently.
if
i
were
sent
back
there,
but
the
clinic
--
or
the
state
were
permitted
to
stand
in
front
of
you
like
a
normal
lawyer
and
make
their
argument
in
the
normal
way,
i
would
suggest
that
would
be
a
significant
difference.
and
what
we
have
here
is--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--yeah.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so
the
constitutional
narrow
tailoring
test
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
test
requires
that
the
law
not
restrict
substantially
more
speech
than
necessary
to
serve
the
government's
interest.
here--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--if
--
if
you're
walking
nonstop,
i
assume
7
to
10
seconds
or
something
like
that.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
yeah.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
respectfully
disagree
on
that
last
point,
your
honor.
the
evidence
in
this
record
is
that
the
--
the
inability
to
speak
with
people
close
to
the
clinic
has
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
petitioners'
ability
to
reach
their
audience.
so
if
someone
happens
to
be
walking
from
the
same
side
of
the
zone
that
you're
standing
on,
you
may
have
a
shot.
now,
the
clinic
still
has
the
space
in
front
of
the
clinic
to
talk
to
people,
which
you
don't,
but
you
may
have
a
shot
if
you're
on
the
right
spot.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
and
if
you
can
identify
the
audience
early
enough.
but,
for
example,
places
like
worcester
and
springfield,
where
essentially
the
only
chance
to
reach
the
audience
is
by
standing
on
the
public
sidewalk
and
waving
a
leaflet
as
they
drive
through
the
driveway
entrance.
if
you
have
to
stand
35
feet
back
and
do
that,
the
evidence
here
shows
there's
essentially
zero
chance
to
reach
that
audience.
so
it
is--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
it.
so
yes,
there's
a
private
parking
lot,
but
there's
a
public
sidewalk
on
which,
before
this
law,
you
had
the
right
to
engage
in
speech.
the
fact
that
this
law
pushes
you
35
feet
back
is
what
makes
it
impossible
to
make
the
offer.
many
people
would
just
drive
on
by,
they
don't
want
the
information,
and
that's
fine.
that's
their
right.
but
many
people
do
want
the
information
and
have
acted
on
the
information.
and
this
law
makes
it
much
harder,
almost
impossible
in
places
like
worcester
and
springfield,
to
offer
it.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so,
as
the
size
of
the
zone
decreases,
i
think
the
--
the
imposition
on
the
speech
rights
is
--
you
know,
gets
less
and
less
and
better
and
better.
and
so
the
adequacy
of
the
alternatives,
for
example,
that
may
improve
as
you
go.
it
would
still
be
a
problem,
i
think,
to
have
zones
on
the
sidewalk
where,
even
when
no
one's
there,
it's
a
criminal
act
to
have
a
conversation.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
that's
--
that's
precisely
the
point.
that's
why
this
is
not
something
that
should
be
addressed
with
a
statute
like
this.
this
is
something
that
should
be
addressed
with
either
a
statute
drawn
to
something
like
large
crowds
or
a
dispersal
statute.
the
brief
--
amicus
brief
for
new
york
state
in
support
of
massachusetts
here
talks
about
how
concord,
new
hampshire
and
los
angeles
deal
with
this
problem.
they
give
the
police
the
power
to
disperse
crowds
when
they
become
obstructive
or
violent,
the
same
way
this
court
approved
in
boos
v.
barry.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
so--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--in
many
respects
it
is.
in
many
respects
it
is
no
different
than
the
speech-free
zone
in
the
jews
for
jesus
case.
it's
a
place
where
the
government
claims
it
can
essentially
turn
off
the
first
amendment.
but
the
government
says--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--i
agree
the
government
has
eliminated
more
than
speech
on
that
sidewalk,
but
they've
eliminated
speech
on
that
sidewalk
as
surely
as
in
the
jews
for
jesus
case.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
yes.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
thank
you,
justice
alito.
yes.
so
they
haven't
eliminated
speech
for
all
people.
they
have--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
i
don't
that
--
that
that
interpretation
doesn't
do
very
much.
that
statute--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--so
the
attorney
general
says
it's
more
than
just
getting
to
work
and
leaving
work.
it
says
it's
just
doing
their
jobs.
first,
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
the
authority
to
do
that;
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
they
could
go
arrest
somebody
who
happened
to
speak
about
abortion
when
they
work
for
an
abortion
clinic.
they
have
an
absolute
statutory
defense.
but
even
if
they
could
limit
it
to
just
doing
their
job,
you
end
up
with
the
problem
that
the
ninth
circuit
sought
in
the
hoyt
case,
which
is
if
the
clinic
is
allowed
to
use
that
sidewalk,
even
just
to
say,
"good
morning,
may
i
help
you
into
the
clinic.
"
and
the
government
says
that's
a
valid
use
of
our
public
sidewalks,
but
the
state
says
mrs.
mccullen
will
go
to
prison
if
she
goes
on
that
sidewalk
and
says,
"good
morning,
may
i
offer
you
an
alternative?
"
as
the
ninth
circuit
panel
said,
that's
indubitably
content-based.
the
government
doesn't
get
to
decide
that
the
public
sidewalk
--
which
it
leaves
open
for
people
just
walking
by,
right?
if
i'm
going
down
that
sidewalk
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee,
it's
fine.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
i
--
i
agree.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
interpretation
is
flagrantly
unconstitutional.
the
government
can't
simply
say
to
people
who
work
for
planned
parenthood,
we
won't
arrest
you
when
you
talk
on
the
sidewalk
unless
you
talk
about
abortion,
right?
if
you
talk
about
abortion,
then
we'll
arrest
you.
and
that
mirrors
--
that
mirrors
the
state's
interpretation
of
its
--
of
the
exemption
for
people
walking
through
the
zone,
where
it
says
you
can
walk
through,
and
this
is
j.a.
93-94,
"provided
that
the
individual
does
not
do
anything
else
within
the
buffer
zone,
such
as
expressing
their
views
about
abortion.
"
so
the
government's
saying
you
can
walk
through,
but
you
can't
talk
about
abortion.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
well,
i
--
i
agree.
i
don't
think--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--well,
the
--
the
interpretation
as
to
the
employees
that
the
attorney
general
has
proffered
for
6
years
is
about
speech
about
abortion.
so
it's
not
they
can't
talk
about
abortion--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--the
attorney
general
has
taken
multiple
positions
on
that.
in
the
lower
court,
their
position
was
you
can't
talk
about
abortion
or
partisan
issues.
they
told
the
first
circuit
that
you
can't
even
wear
--
that
you
can
be
arrested
if
you
wore
a
cleveland
indians
shirt
while
you
were
just
passing
through.
at
this
court,
they
say
that
people
passing
through
have
speech
rights.
either
one
is
bad.
either
way
the
government
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
say
who
gets
to
speak
and
who
doesn't
get
to
speak
on
an
open
public
sidewalk.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time?
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
several
points.
first,
it's
not
impossible
to
draw
a
statute
to
deal
with
the
problems.
49
other
states
deal
with
the
alleged
problems.
the
next
prosecution
massachusetts
institutes
for
blocking
a
door
will
be
its
first
in
at
least
two
decades.
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
it
is
the
only
state
statute
of
its
kind.
there
are
a
few
municipal
statutes
of
--
that
are
similar
that
are,
frankly,
based
on
the
first
circuit
decisions
in
this
case.
secondly,
here,
the
police
officers
testified
that
they
know
all
the
regular
players
at
the
clinics.
that's
their
testimony.
they
know
them
all.
well,
if
you
know
them
all
and
if
they're
congregating
in
the
doors
and
they
need
to
get
out
of
the
doors,
you
should
go
to
court
and
get
an
injunction
and
say,
stay
out
of
the
doors.
until
they
do
that,
the
claim
that
they
have
to
throw
their
hands
up
and
put
people
in
prison
for
peaceful
speech
is
not
a
very
persuasive
claim.
secondly,
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
united
states
cited
--
cited
you
to
from
the
record,
all
of
it,
boston,
saturday
mornings.
the
claim
that
the
legislature
can
extrapolate
from
that
to
ban
peaceful
speech
in
boston
at
other
times
when
the
sidewalk
is
empty,
and
at
other
clinics
where
the
sidewalk
is
empty
and
say,
well,
there's
abortion
there,
and
where
there's
abortion,
we
expect
certain
speech
problems,
therefore,
we're
going
to
make
it
illegal
to
speak
there.
that's
the
state's
claim
here.
the
evidence
is
boston
specific.
the
first
amendment
requires
precision.
they
need
to
regulate
the
problem
where
it
happens
and
if
that
means
police
officers,
if
that
means
dispersal
laws,
if
that
means
actually
bringing
a
face
prosecution,
which
the
united
states
has
never
done,
they
ought
to
do
that.
but
they
shouldn't
imprison
mrs.
mccullen
for
her
speech.
third,
the
united
states
mentions--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--i
don't
believe
the
government--
mr.
mark
l
rienzi
--thank
you,
your
honor.
no,
it
is
not.
the
statute
is
not
remotely
limited
to
that.
i
direct
the
court
to
section
c
--
i'm
sorry,
section
--
it's
the
definitions
section
of
the
statute.
definition
4,
physical
obstruction,
includes
even
making
entry
unreasonably
difficult.
it
is
not
at
all
solely
for
violence.
it's
for
physical
obstruction
even
making
it
unreasonably
difficult.
counsel
said
that
they
brought
45
cases
across
the
country.
that's
true.
zero,
zero
in
massachusetts.
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
restrict
the
peaceful
speech.
lastly,
to
the
extent
the
court
feels
the
need
to
recognize
that
there
are
some
situations
that
are
so
extraordinary
that
we
should
put
people
in
prison
for
peaceful
conversations
on
public
streets,
that
ought
to
be
the
exceptional
case
where
the
statute
passes
strict
scrutiny
and
the
state
actually
has
tried
the
solutions
that
it
claims
don't
work.
that
is
not
this
case.
the
government
does
not
claim
its
restriction
to
pass
strict
scrutiny.
they
didn't
say
it
would
be
impossible.
they
said
it
would
be
hard.
49
other
states
do
different
things.
the
federal
government
protects
peaceful
speech
in
the
face
law.
face
is
a
great
example
of
something
that
deliberately
gets
at
the
problem
and
if
somebody's
in
the
doorway
and
they
need
to
get
out
of
the
doorway,
the
answer
is,
sir,
please
get
out
of
the
doorway.
it
is
not
dragging
mrs.
mccullen
off
to
prison
because
she
has
a
consensual
conversation
25
feet
away
from
the
doorway.
that's
an
extraordinary
power
for
the
government
to
ask
to
selectively
control
speech
among
willing
participants
on
public
sidewalks.
thank
you
very
much.
