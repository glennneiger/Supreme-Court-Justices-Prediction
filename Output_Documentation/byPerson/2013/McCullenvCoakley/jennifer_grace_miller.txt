ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
can
and
do
protest
abortion
in
massachusetts
and
they
can
do
it
in
the
public
spaces
right
outside
abortion
facilities.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
it
--
your
honor,
i
would
say
it's
a
congestion
case.
certainly,
ms.
mccullen
and
others
can
have
those
conversations
right
in
front
of
the
abortion
facility.
it's
just
that
those
conversations
are
moved
back
a
few
feet.
and
in
point
of
fact,
ms.
mccullen--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--just
as
a
factual
matter,
i
did
want
to
point
out
that
in
boston,
for
example,
the
door
is
recessed.
it's
a
private
entrance
with
a
recessed
door
and
the
35
feet
is
measured
from
the
door.
so
it's
actually
only
about
23
feet.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
i'm
sorry?
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
you.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
two
car
lengths.
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
we
measured
this
courtroom.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
well,
certainly,
there's
a
picture
of
a
calm
conversation--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--certainly,
the
evidence
showed
something
else.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
experience
showed
that
there
had
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
space
around
the
facilities.
what
we
had,
for
example,
were
pro
choice
advocates
swearing
and
screaming
at
pro
life
advocates
within
the
buffer
zone.
that's
at
joint
appendix
26
through
28.
you
had
the
pink
group,
which
is
a
pro
choice
organization,
pushing
and
shoving
and
jockeying
for
position.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
but,
again,
experience
showed
that
even
individuals
who
wanted
to
engage
in
close,
quiet,
peaceful
conversation
were
creating
congestion
around--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--they
didn't
make
a
fine
distinction,
your
honor,
because
it
didn't
matter
whether
people
were
being
peaceful
or
whether
they
were--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
write
such
a
statute,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
well,
again,
experience
showed
that
some
amount
of
space
around
the
buffer
zones
--
around
the
facilities
needed
to
be
open.
so
then
it
was
simply
a
question
of
looking
at
past
experience,
at
the
prior
injunctions,
for
example,
your
honor.
for
example,
in
planned
parenthood
v.
bell,
which
is
cited
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
there
was
actually
a
50-foot
buffer
zone
imposed
by
a
district
court
judge
in
massachusetts.
we
knew
from,
of
course,
madsen
and
schenk,
that
36-foot
buffer
zones
were
acceptable
in
--
when
you
were
being
responsive
to
that
kind
of
problem;
and
we
knew
that
a
15-foot
buffer
zone
would
be
acceptable
if
responding
to
a
similar
kind
of
problem.
so
at
some
point
or
another,
the
--
the
legislature
was
aware
that
some
amount
of
space
needed
to
be
created,
and
it
chose
35
feet
as
a
reasonable
response,
a
reasonable
amount
of
space
around
the
facility
to
allow--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--and
i
will.
[laughter]
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
i
will
of
course,
your
honor.
the
best
description
of
that
is,
of
course,
commissioner
evans's
description
of
the
space
functioning
like
a
goalie's
crease.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
no
one
is
guaranteed
any
specific
form
of
communication.
so,
there
is
no
guarantee,
as
a
doctrinal
matter,
to
close,
quiet
conversations.
the
question
is,
are
there
adequate
alternatives?
and
in
this
particular
instance
in
this
record,
there
are
adequate
alternatives.
take,
for
example,
the
situation--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--there
is--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--generally
on
the
public
sidewalk.
but,
of
course,
that
right
is
tempered
by
the
--
the
state's
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
public
sidewalks
function
as
they
should
and
that
there
is
peace
and
good
order.
but
i
would
give
you
an
example,
your
honor.
i'd
--
i'd
point
you--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--your
honor,
we
--
we
couldn't
here,
obviously,
because
that
wasn't
the
problem.
the
problem
with
making
that
kind
of
a
fine
distinction
is
that
it
doesn't
address
what
the
state's--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--you
do.
as
long
as
your
protection
is
narrowly
tailored
to
your
interest,
you--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--it
would
be
enormously
difficult
to
write
a
statute
that
addressed
the
problem
and
the
significant
interest
here
where
you
are
making
that
kind
of
a
find--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--your
honor,
i
think
what
the
statute
distinguishes
is
based
on
what
those
two
different
people
are
doing.
the
--
as
you
say,
the
employee
could
say,
if
she
was
performing
her
job,
which
would
be
escorting
that
individual
into
the
facility,
and
if
she
wasn't
unnecessarily
cluttering
up
the
--
the
buffer
zone,
which
was
the
reason
that
the
statute
was
--
was
enacted
in
the
first
place,
then
that
person
could
say
that.
you
judge
it
on
what
she's
doing,
not
what
she's
saying.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
right.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
right.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
the
--
what
the
legislature
has
done
is
that
it
has
created
a
circle
around
these
entrances
and
has
only
permitted
particular
conduct
within
that
buffer
zone
to
allow
the
traffic
to
keep
moving
on
the
sidewalk
and
to
allow
people
to
get
in
and
out.
so
unless
you
have
a
permissible
purpose
for
your
conduct
to
be
in
the
buffer
zone,
then
you
cannot
be
in
the
buffer
zone
and
that
is
what
the
statute
is
addressing.
with
respect--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--the--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--the
statute
is
not
focused
on
that
person's
speech.
the
statute
is
focused
on
--
on
what
they're
doing
in
the
buffer
zone.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
certainly,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
however,
with
respect
to--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--with
respect
to
viewpoint
discrimination,
your
honors,
the
statute
has
a
perfectly
legitimate
sweep.
it
allows
people
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
building.
it
allows
pedestrians
to
go
--
move
back
and
forth
across
the
sidewalk,
and
it
allows
for
even
employees,
the
snow
shovelers
mentioned
in
the
walter
dell
brief.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
right.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
what
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
is
that
speech
in
that
particular
circumstance
of
the
employee
actually
doing
her
job
and
not
unnecessarily
cluttering
the
buffer
zone,
what
--
then
that
speech
is
simply
incidental
to
the
permissible
conduct.
and
it
doesn't
make
the
statute
on
its
face
--
it
doesn't
make
it
viewpoint-discriminatory.
because
as
i
said--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--it's
incidental
to
her
performing
her
job.
and,
your
honor,
it
--
if
there
were
a
circumstance
where
that
kind
of
speech
were
habitual
or
widespread
or
touched
on
advocacy
in
any
way,
shape
or
form,
then
obviously,
petitioners
would
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
statute
as
applied.
but,
of
course,
they
haven't
even
begun
to
make
the
case
that
there's
viewpoint
discrimination
actually
happening
in
the
buffer
zone.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
it's
incidental
to
the
permissible
purpose
for
which
they
are
allowed
in
the
buffer
zone.
and
i
should
point
out,
actually,
that
pplm
--
and
again,
this
is
in
the
walter
dillinger
brief
at
page
2a
--
they
actually
train
their
escorts
not
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
speech.
so
that's
first
of
all.
and
second
of
all,
escorts
really
only
exist
and
only
operate
in
boston
on
saturday
mornings
for
a
couple
of
hours.
they
don't
work
at
all
in
worcester
or
springfield.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
right.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
because
the
experience
has
shown
that
you
do
have
problems
at
worcester
and
springfield,
and
those
problems
do
center
around
the
driveways.
85
to
90
percent
of
patients
who
approach
those
facilities
do
so
by
car.
and
the
only
public
sidewalk
--
there's
a
small
slice
of
public
sidewalk
between
the
road
and
the
private
driveway,
and
that's
the
only
opportunity
that
you'd
--
that
individuals
would
have
in
order
to
protest.
and
what's
happened
in
the
past
in
worcester
and
springfield
is
that
you
would
have
pacing
across
these
driveways.
that's
at
joint
appendix
41.
you'd
have
individuals
stopping
and
standing
and
refusing
to
move
in
worcester.
you'd
have
literature
thrown
into
cars.
you'd
have
hands
and
heads
thrust
into
open
windows.
and
there
was
at
least
one
accident
in
worcester.
that's
at
j.a.
19.
so
there
definitely
was
conduct
that
was
a
problem,
and
it
wasn't
even
that
there
are
a
couple
of
lone
protestors
in
worcester
or
springfield.
there
are
events
in
worcester
and
springfield.
there
are
regular
protestors
there
every
week,
first
of
all.
and
second
of
all,
the
crowds
get
much
larger
at
the
semi-annual--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--your
honor,
the
problem,
of
course,
that
the
statute
was
looking
to
address
was
not
with
protestors,
per
se.
it
was
with
people
who
had
a
desire
to
be
as
close
to
the
facility
doors
and
driveways
as
possible
to
communicate
their
message.
but
the
result
of
that
was
congestion
around
these
doors
and
driveways.
so
it
wasn't
a
concern
about
the
protest;
it
was
a
concern
about
people
actually
being
able
to
use--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--i
would
agree.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
again,
the
experience.
we've
had
quite
a
long
experience
in
massachusetts,
a
long
history
of
crowds
around
these
doors
or
of
even
violence
at
the
clinics.
and
we've
had
law
enforcement
and
others
who
have
viewed
that
crowd
on
a
regular
basis
and
have
described
it,
the
activity
around
the
doors
and
driveways,
as
being
so
frenetic.
you
have
so
many
people
there,
the
bad
actors
and
the
good
actors.
you
have
so
many
people
congested
in
the
same
space
from
all
points
of
view
that
it
effectively
blocks
the
door.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
right.
well,
of
course
labor
actions
are
protected
by
federal
law,
so
any
state
law
couldn't
directly
conflict
with
the--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--well,
this
court
has
repeatedly
upheld
restrictions
on
labor
activity,
if
given
the
right
record.
so
there
is
--
so
the
answer
is
yes,
the
first
amendment
would
permit
regulation
on
the
record--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--no,
no,
no.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
right.
well,
certainly
it
would
be
an
easier
case
to
defend
if
there
was
a
history,
as
we
have
here.
and
you'd
have
to
prove
that
the
solution--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--well,
i
don't
think
there
has
been
the
kind
of
history
and
sustained
violence
that
we've
had
--
this
almost
unique
record
in
massachusetts
with
respect
to
facilities.
but
your
honor,
i
would
say--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--does
not
have
is--
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
--in
--
there
was,
when
the
legislature
was
considering
the
statute,
there
was
a
survey
submitted
by
naral
that
reviewed
the
experience
of
the
ten
facilities
that
were
then
in
existence
in
massachusetts.
and
six
of
them
said
that
they
had
significant
problems
outside
of
their
facilities.
eight
of
them
said,
at
the
very
least,
they
had
regular
protestors.
there
were
two
who
did
not
report
that
there
was
a
significant
problem.
ms.
jennifer
grace
miller
correct.
thank
you,
your
honors.
