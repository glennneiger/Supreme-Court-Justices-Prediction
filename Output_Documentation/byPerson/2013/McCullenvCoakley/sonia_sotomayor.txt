you
are
not
taking
the
position
that
1997
was
the
last
time
an
entrance
was
obstructed
or
that
the
police
were
called
to
open
access
to
a
clinic?
are
you
taking
that
position
that
the
last
time
it
happened
was
1997?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
do
know
that
in
the
record
there
were
more
examples?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
protestors
like
the
one
we
had
in
the
schneider
case
at
a
funeral
of
a
veteran
can
go
right
up
to
the
public
sidewalk
outside
the
church
and
put
up
the
signs
that
they
did
and
give
out
the
leaflets
that
they
did,
talking
about
that
veteran
in
the
ways
that
they
did?
that's
okay
by
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
was
no
evidence
there
that
they
were
--
that
they
were
disruptive.
they
were
just
expressing
their
first
amendment
rights.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
is
the
potential
for
disruption
because
of
the
strong
sentiments
around
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
it
was
two
car
lengths.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
two
car
lengths.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
two
car
lengths.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's,
i
think,
a
little
less
than
this
courtroom.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
abortion
clinic
that
has
not
had
--
is
there
any
abortion
clinic
that
has
not
had
a
problem
in
massachusetts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
of
our
--
which
of
our
precedents
do
you
think
governs
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
questioning
the
government's
representation?
i
haven't
looked
at
face.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
limited
to
the
three
situations,
to
--
to
murder,
arson
and
chaining?
