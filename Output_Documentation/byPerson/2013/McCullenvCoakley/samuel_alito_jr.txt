justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
record
show
how
many
clinics
in
the
state
are
covered
by
the
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
one
of
the
examples
that
is
given
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case,
and
they
--
they
provide
a
lot
of
background,
is
a
state
law
that
creates
a
buffer
zone
around
every
fraternal
lodge.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
haven't
entirely
eliminated
speech
because
employees
are
permitted--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--to
speak
within
the
scope
of
their
employment;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
a
distinction
that
is
in
this
statute?
now,
let
me
give
you
this
--
this
example.
a
woman
is
approaching
the
door
of
a
clinic,
and
she
enters
the
zone.
two
other
women
approach
her.
one
is
an
employee
of
the
facility,
the
other
is
not.
the
first
who
is
an
employee
of
the
facility
says,
good
morning.
this
is
a
safe
facility.
the
other
one
who's
not
an
employee
says,
good
morning,
this
is
not
a
safe
facility.
now,
under
this
statute,
the
first
one
has
not
committed
a
crime;
the
second
one
has
committed
a
crime.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
that
they've
expressed
a
different
viewpoint.
one
says
it's
safe;
one
says
it's
not
safe.
now,
how
can
a
statute
like
that
be
considered
viewpoint-neutral?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
what
she
--
what
she's
doing
is
what
she's
saying.
she
approaches
and
she
says
this
is
a
safe
facility.
the
other
one
says
it's
not
a
safe
facility.
they
have
a
bad
safety
record.
and
they're
--
they're
the
only
people
in
the
zone.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it's
as
big
as
this
courtroom,
they're
the
only
three
people
in
that
zone.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
difference
is
a
viewpoint
difference.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
could
have
created
a
completely
silent
zone.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
permissible
or
not,
but
it
would
be
a
different
question.
you
could
have
--
you
could
say
nobody
can
speak
here.
people
can
shovel
snow.
if
they
work
for
the
--
for
the
clinic,
they
can
sweep
the
sidewalk,
they
can
do
maintenance,
they
can
go
in
and
they
--
and
out,
but
they
can't
utter
a
word.
well,
that
would
be
a
different
statute.
but
that's
not
this
statute.
this
statute
says
that
there
is
an
exemption
for
employees
of
the
facility
if
they
are
operating
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
and
surely
coming
out
and
saying
this
is
a
safe
facility
is
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
how
do
you
justify
that?
forget
about
the
conduct
now.
the
speech
that's
allowed.
one
can
speak
and
say
it's
safe.
the
other
cannot
speak
and
say
it
is
not
safe.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
it's
incidental?
what
if
there's
a
real
question
about
whether
this
is
a
safe
facility?
that's
incidental
speech?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
you
sit
down,
can
i
ask
you
this
question
that's
suggested
by
the
afl-cio
briefs.
suppose
the
state
legislature
has
hearings,
and
they
say
there's
a
long
history
of
violence
and
obstruction
at
sites
where
there
is
a
strike
and
replacement
workers
have
been
called
in.
could
the
--
could
a
state
pass
a
statute
that
says
there
is
a
35-foot
zone
like
this
around
every
location
in
the
state
whenever
there
is
a
strike
and
there
are
replacement
workers?
could
they
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
could
federal
law
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
every
case,
in
every
case--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--there
could
just
be
a
flat
rule.
doesn't
matter
whether
there
is
any
history
at
that
place,
any
indication
there's
going
to
be
violence.
maybe
there
will,
maybe
there
won't.
across
the
board,
a
zone
around
every
place
where
there's
a
strike.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
think
there's
a
history
--
you
don't
think
there's
a
history
of
violence
at
places
where
there
are
strikes
and
replacement
workers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not
my
understanding
of
the
labor
history.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
far
do
you
think
--
what
do
you
think
a
state
legislature
or
congress
needs
to
find
in
order
to
establish
a
zone
around
some
category
of
facility
at
which
there
--
they
have
some
evidence
that
there
have
been
some
disruptions
and
some
obstruction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
take
the
example
of
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
real
--
real
ordinance
someplace
you
can't
have,
there's
a
buffer
zone
around
fraternal
lodges.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
they
have
to
find?
or
slaughterhouses.
or
labor
--
or
sites
where
there
are
strikes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
kind
of
a
record
do
they
need?
could
--
could
there
be
a
state
law
that
says
no
picketing
around
any
--
you
can
never
have
a
picket
around
any
store
to
try
to
prevent
people
--
to
tell
people
don't
go
--
don't
patronize
this
store.
could
they
do
that?
isn't
that
thornhill
v.
alabama?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
i
understand.
stop.
i'll
ask
this
one
more
time.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
it's
--
i
understand
the
--
the
desire
to
create
a
buffer
zone
around
certain
sensitive
facilities.
what
i'm
asking
is:
what
requirements,
if
any,
does
congress
or
a
state
legislature
have
to
meet
before
they
can
do
that?
if
it
is
done,
do
we
simply
say
they
--
they
have
a
rational
basis
for
it
and
that's
it,
so
they
can
establish
basically
a
buffer
zone
around
any
kind
of
a
facility
they
want.
if
not,
then
what
needs
to
be
established?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
one
more
thing.
what
about
the
example
of
a
strike?
there
certainly
is
a
long
history
of
labor
violence
in
places
where
there
are
replacement
workers.
could
that
--
could
it
be
done
in
that
situation
across
the
board?
