mr.
rienzi,
the
problem
that
the
state
faced
is
it
doesn't
know
--
and
it
has
a
history,
there
was
a
considerable
history
of
disturbances
and
blocking
the
entrance,
and
it
doesn't
know
in
advance
who
are
the
well-behaved
people
and
who
are
the
people
who
won't
behave
well.
so
--
and
after
the
disturbance
occurs,
it's
too
late.
so
the
state
is
trying
to
say,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
entrance
is
not
blocked,
and
the
only
way
we
can
do
that
is
to
have
a
rule
that
applies
to
everyone.
we
can't
--
we
can't
screen
people
to
know
who
will
be
well
behaved
and
who
will
be
disruptive.

how
much
is
--
how
much
is
restricted?
how
--
how
long
does
it
take
from
when
you
enter
the
buffer
zone
until
you
reach
the
clinic
entrance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
conversation
can
go
on
before
those
7
to
10
seconds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
not
much
you're
going
to
be
able
to
do
to
have
a
conversation
that
will
persuade
people
in
7
to
10
seconds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
a
--
a
contested
point
because
the
attorney
general
reads
‶
scope
of
employment
″
to
mean
getting
to
my
job
and
leaving
my
job,
and
does
not
include
speech
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
the
--
the
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state
says
this
is
a
term
that
needs
to
be
interpreted.
the
term
is
‶
scope
of
employment
″.
scope
of
employment
within
this
statute
means
getting
to
work
and
leaving
work,
and
it
doesn't
mean
political
speech.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
‶
such
as
″,
it's
‶
such
as
″.
it
says
you
can't
talk
about
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
not
content
--
it's
not
based
on
speech
about
abortion.
it's
that
you
can't
speak
about
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
an
injunction.
