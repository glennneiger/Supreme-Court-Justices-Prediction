but
suppose
--
and
this
is
still
justice
kagan's
question
--
suppose
it
were
a
given,
assume
that
those
laws
just
did
not
work.
could
there
then
be
consideration
of
a
buffer
zone?
now,
this
is
a
hypothetical
that
i'm
sure
that
you
wouldn't
accept
in
the
context
of
your
case,
but
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
laws
simply
do
not
--
reference
to
obstruction
and
blocking
entrance,
simply
do
not
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
am
i
correct
that
the
attorney
general's
regulation
with
respect
to
employees
of
the
clinic
in
a
way
made
this
even
more
content-based
because
there
was
a
prohibition
on
discussing
the
--
the
abortion
procedure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
--
let
me
ask
this
question:
assume
it
to
be
true
that
an
elderly
lady
who
was
quite
successful
and
had
meaningful
communication
with
over
100
women
going
into
the
clinic,
before
this
law,
was
unable
to
talk
to
even
one
after
this
law.
assume
that's
true.
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
our
analysis?
and
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
justice
breyer's
question
about
whether
or
not
a
law
can
be
written
to
protect
that
kind
of
activity
but
still
to
prevent
obstruction
and
blocking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
there's
no
--
no
guarantee
of
talking
quietly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
me
to
write
an
opinion
and
say
there's
no
free
speech
right
to
quietly
converse
on
an
issue
of
public
importance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
know
where
you're
going
to
--
this
--
this
goes
to
justice
breyer's
question.
you
--
you
cannot
write
an
ordinance
that
says
obstruction,
intimidation,
blocking
is
prohibited,
and
still
allow
the
kind
of
conversation
that
i
described
earlier
and
that
i
want
you
to
assume
to
be
true
for
the
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
speech
cases,
when
you
address
one
problem,
you
have
a
duty
to
protect
speech
that's
--
that's
--
that's
lawful.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
i
think
what
you
have
to
say
to
this
court
is
that
it's
impossible
to
write
a
statute
of
the
kind
that
we
are
discussing
now,
and
this
is
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
consequence
is
just
what
is
described
by
justice
scalia;
that
is,
the
consequence
of
the
statute.
are
you
saying
that
the
consequences
of
what
you
write
are
irrelevant
to
this
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
then.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
credit
the
statement
or
the
implication
that
for
an
employee
to
say,
"we're
glad
you're
here.
"
"you're
going
to
be
well
taken
care
of.
"
"this
is
a
safe
facility.
"
"it's
important
for
you
to
be
here.
"
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
credit
your
statement
that
that's
incidental
to
their
function.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
concern
that,
absent
this
statute,
there
will
be
physical
obstruction
to
the
entrance?
is
that
a
major
concern?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask,
if
that's
--
if
that's
your
concern,
how
many
federal
prosecutions
were
brought
in
massachusetts
for
physical
obstruction
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
federal
interest
that
you're
the
defending
is
you
don't
want
this
physical
obstruction
statute
to
be
misinterpreted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
wrong
with
the
physical
obstruction
statute
as
an
answer
to
many
of
the
problems
that
massachusetts
is
facing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
obstruction
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
holmes
said
even
a
dog
knows
the
difference
in
being
stumbled
over
and
being
kicked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can't
--
can't
--
you're
saying
federal
prosecutions
can't
tell
when
people
are
deliberately
obstructing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
beyond
--
this
is
beyond
the
realm
of
the
law?
