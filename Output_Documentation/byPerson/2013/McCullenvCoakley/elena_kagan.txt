justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rienzi,
the
state
says,
of
that
particular
tool,
that
it's
a
hard
thing
to
prosecute
because
you
have
to
show
intent,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
obstruction
and
interference
that
goes
on
naturally
just
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
around.
so
that
is
an
insufficient
tool
is
what
the
state
argues.
justice
elena
kagan
and
sometimes
there
are
those
bad
actors,
but
probably
more
often
it's
just
a
function
of
there
are
just
lots
of
people,
and
they,
your
clients
and
all
of
--
all
of
them
want
to
be
as
close
as
possible
to
the
site,
and
that
that
naturally
leads
to
an
interference
with
normal
access.
justice
elena
kagan
but
are
you
saying
that
you
could
not
do
an
act
that
instead
just
says,
look,
it's
a
little
bit
too
hard
to
figure
out
what
and
what
does
not
disrupt
peace
and
order,
so
we're
just
going
to
say
25
feet
around
a
funeral,
or
25
feet
around
any
facility,
that
that's
never
permissible?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
for
example,
i
was
intrigued
by
one
of
the
examples
that
you
gave
in
your
own
brief,
which
you
said
slaughterhouses.
so,
let's
say,
that
there
are
animal
rights
activists,
and
this
is
easy
to
imagine,
who
try
to
interfere
with
access
in
and
out
of
slaughterhouses.
and
a
state
passes
a
regulation
that
says
there's
a
ton
of
interference,
it's
preventing
the
operation
of
these
facilities,
employees
can't
get
in,
suppliers
can't
get
in,
slaughterhouses
are
leaving
the
state
because
of
this
problem,
and
so
we're
just
going
to
set
up
a
zone
and
let's
call
it
30
feet,
because
it's
very
hard
to
enforce
anything
else.
i
guess
my
reaction
to
that
hypothetical
--
you
--
you
must
have
used
it
for
me
to
say,
oh,
that's
terrible.
but
my
reaction,
my
intuition
was
kind
of
what's
wrong
with
that?
just
have
everybody
take
a
step
back.
so
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but
let's
go
back
to
the
slaughterhouse
case.
i
mean,
there
might
be
people
who
say
it's
really
important
to
us
to
actually
be
able
to
face-to-face
talk
with
the
employees
and
tell
them
why
they
should
get
different
jobs
or
why
they
should
change
their
practices
in
various
kinds
of
ways.
and,
you
know,
there
are
some
people
who
think
signs
and
chants
are
great,
but
there
are
people
who
really
want
to
make
one-to-one
contact
with
the
truck
drivers,
with
the
employees,
whoever.
but
--
but
you
say,
you
know,
we
have
to
let
whatever
interference
goes
on,
even
if
there's
a
record
of
--
of
real
obstruction,
of
real
interference
with
the
operation
of
the
facility,
in
order
to
allow
that
to
happen.
and
i
guess
i
think
that
that's
--
that's
pretty
hard.
justice
elena
kagan
but
isn't
that
more
a
function
that
they
just
have
a
private
parking
lot?
so
even
if
this
law
didn't
exist,
you
actually
couldn't
reach
most
of
these
people
because
they
drive
into
the
private
parking
lot
and
you
can't
talk
to
them
anyway.
justice
elena
kagan
is
there
a
buffer
zone
that
you
would
concede
is
permissible?
in
other
words,
if
it
were
12
feet,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
that
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
i
mean,
how
is
a
law
supposed
to
deal
with
--
with
that,
sort
of
the
fluctuating
conditions
that
may
be
at
a
particular
clinic
site?
justice
elena
kagan
it's
more
than
a
speech-free
zone.
it's
also
a
conduct-free
zone,
right?
you
can't
sell
hats
there,
you
can't,
you
know,
beg
there.
i
mean,
you
just
can't
go
there.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
still
a
thoroughfare--
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
more
than
a
few
feet.
you
know,
35
feet
is
a
ways.
it's
from
this
bench
to
the
end
of
the
court.
and
if
you
imagine
the
chief
justice
as
sort
of
where
the
door
would
be,
it's
most
of
the
width
of
this
courtroom
as
well.
it's
--
it's
pretty
much
this
courtroom,
kind
of.
that's
a
lot
of
space.
justice
elena
kagan
how
did
you
pick
35
feet?
why
35?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
raises
another
question,
ms.
miller,
because
i
assume
that
that's
true
because
the
crowds
and
the
obstruction
really
are
with
respect
to
one
facility
at
certain
periods
of
time.
so
mr.
rienzi
says,
look,
if
it's
at
one
facility,
not
all
ten
of
them
or
whatever
it
is,
and
it's
only
for
certain
periods
of
time,
not
all
day
every
day,
you
know,
why
not
narrow
it
that
way?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
not?
justice
elena
kagan
and
i
would
think,
ms.
miller,
that
if
you
tried
to
do
a
statute
that
distinguished
between
protestors
and
counselors,
that
would
be
content-based
much
more
than
this
statute
is.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
but
--
you
know,
which
is
not
to
say
that
this
statute
doesn't
have
its
problems,
in
my
view.
i
mean,
so
i
guess
i'm
a
little
bit
hung
up
on
why
you
need
so
much
space.
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
true,
mr.
rienzi?
is
massachusetts'
statute
the
only
one
of
this
kind?
