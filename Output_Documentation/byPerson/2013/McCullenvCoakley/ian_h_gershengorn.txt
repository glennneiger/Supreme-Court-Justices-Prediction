mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
massachusetts
statute
here
is
simply
a
place
regulation
that
does
not
ban
speech,
but
instead
effectively
moves
it
from
one
part
of
a
public
forum
to
another,
in
this
case
away
from
the
small
areas--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
precedents
that
are
helpful.
madsen,
of
course,
upheld
the
36-foot
buffer
zone
that
had
a
no-speech
zone
very
much
like
this.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
it
was
an
injunction,
your
honor,
but
it
was
upheld
under
an
even
stricter
standard
that
--
that
is
applies
here.
but
even
aside
from
that,
i
think
a
number
of
the
pillars
of
petitioners'
arguments
here
are
directly
contradicted
by
this
court's
precedents.
so,
for
example,
the
idea
that
--
that
unrestricted
--
that
you
have
the
right
to
choose
the
best
mechanism
of
communication
is
contradicted
by
hefernon
and
by
frisby.
in
hefernon,
there
was
--
the
petitioner
said,
"i
need
to
be
able
to
talk
quietly
to
people
to
ask
for
money,
and
that's
the
only
way
i
can
get
it.
"
and
this
court
said
you
have
ample
communication
channels
--
alternative
channels
over
in
that
booth.
in
frisby,
what
the
protestor
wanted
to
do
was
target
a
house,
and
what
this
court
said
in
frisby
was
you
have
alternative
channels
of
communication.
you
can
go
door
to
door.
you
can
mail
things.
you
can
make
calls.
so
i
think
that
that
pillar
of
the
--
of
the
argument--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--the
alternative--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
no,
your
honor.
the
alternative
in
this
case
is
the
entire
length
of
the
sidewalk,
quiet
counseling,
leafletting,
and
conversation
is
permitted.
it
is
the
last
four
to
five
seconds
before
the
petition
--
before
the
counselors
enter
the
clinic
that--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--your
honor,
the
testimony--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--your
honor,
the
testimony
is
actually
to
the
contrary,
that
they
get
--
that
ms.
mccullen
and
others
get
quite
good
at
identifying
who
is
going
and
is
not
going
into
the
clinic.
and
actually
--
so
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
last
four
to
five
seconds
before
they
go
in.
and
justice
kagan--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor,
let
me
address
that.
the
answer
is
--
the
answer
is
yes,
but
that's
not
all.
what
the
legislature
had
before
it,
and
justice
breyer--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
number.
there
are
45
face
prosecutions
nationwide.
but
face
is
a
very
different
statute.
the
criminal
prosecutions
in
face
are
for
--
are
for
murder,
arson,
and
for
chaining
yourselves
to
doorways.
they
are
not
for
the
kind
of
quiet
counseling
and
--
and
picketing
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
that's
right.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
an
answer
to
the
problems
massachusetts
is
facing
because,
as
justice
scalia
has
repeatedly
pointed
out,
these
are
not
the
type
of
defendants
who
are
at
issue
in
the
face
act.
what
face
act
is
talking
about
is
murder,
arson,
and
chaining
to
doorways.
what
this
statute
is
getting
at
is
something
quite
different.
it
is
congestion
in
front
of
doorways.
it
is
people
--
individuals
handing
out--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
those
are
specific
intent
crimes
in
both
massachusetts
and
in
the
federal
statute.
the
--
for
example--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--i'm
saying--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--i'm
saying
what's
at
issue
here,
your
honor,
is
not
that
kind
of
--
of
deliberative
obstruction.
what
the
testimony
before
the
legislature
was,
was
that
there
was
a
congregation
of
people
and
the
massing
of
people.
that
indeed,
there
were
pro
choice
protestors
in
the
zone
who
have
--
certainly
are
not
intending
to
obstruct.
and
it
was
--
so
what
they
were
dealing
with
was
quiet
counseling
leading
to
--
counter-counseling
leading
to
congestion
in
front
of
the
doorways.
there
also
was
testimony
that
there
were
people
handing
literature
to
moving
cars,
accidents
and
near
accidents,
which
are
not
intentional
obstruction
in
the
least.
the
kinds
of
statutes
that
this
court
--
that
--
that
are
at
issue
in
the
specific
intent
crime
in
massachusetts
and
the
face
act
do
not
get
at
the
kind
of
peaceful,
quiet,
yet
congesting
and
disrupting
conduct
that
is
at
issue
here.
and,
justice
breyer,
i
would
urge
you
to
look
at
the
evans
testimony
at
joint
appendix
67
to
71.
the
hefernon
testimony
at
79
to
80.
the
coakley
testimony
of
ja-51,
and
the
capone
testimony
at
ja-19.
there
are
specific
arguments
as
to
why
these
did
not
work.
the
argument
petitioners
make
here,
your
honors,
is
very,
very
broad.
the
lower
courts
have
upheld
buffer
zones
around
political
conventions,
around
circuses,
around
funerals.
the
idea
that
you
could
defeat
those
buffer
zones
by
simply
saying,
i
would
like
to
have
a
quiet
conversation
with
the
delegates
as
they
go
into
the
political
convention,
would
wipe
out
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
the
kind
of
buffer
zones
that
this
court,
i
submit,
and
that
the
lower
courts
have
found
are
--
are
needed.
justice--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
history
of
fraternal
lodges,
but
what's
at
issue
here
is
really--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so
i
think
--
i
think,
for
example,
in
the
slaughterhouse
or
what
they
found
in
--
around
circuses
and
conventions
is
the
idea
that
there
is
massing
of
people
that
prevents
the
orderly
ingress
and
egress
to
and
from
the
facilities.
what
the
state
was
dealing
with
here
was
not
an
isolated
incident,
but
the
state
had
14,
15
years
of
history
of
the
massing.
they
had
tried
other
things.
they
had
tried
the
statutes
that
justice
scalia
identified.
they
had
tried
a
narrower
buffer
zone,
and
the
testimony
was
it
wasn't
working,
and
that
the
police
were
coming
in
and
said,
we
can't
enforce
it.
why
is
that?
because
they
had
a
hard
time
measuring
consent,
evaluating
what
does--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--right.
and
what
--
actually,
in
thornhill,
they
struck
that
down.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
but
it
was
very
different
from
this
statute.
thornhill's
was
you
can't
go
anywhere
near
the
facility
and
it
was
--
it
was
only
one
type
of
speech.
this
is
content
neutral
and
it
is
--
it
is
a
narrow
buffer
zone.
justice
kagan,
i
really
urge
you
to
--
because--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--yes.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
so,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
evidentiary
realm,
it's
hard
to
have
hard-and-fast
rules.
i
would
say
you
would
need
a
lengthy
history
of
serious
congestion
and
other
problems
and
--
and
a
--
some
sort
of
showing
that
the
alternatives
weren't
working,
but
that's
what's
here.
this
problem
has
been
going
on
in
massachusetts
since
1994.
this
is
not
something
the
legislature
woke
up
one
day
and
said
in
light
of
one
incident,
we're
going
to
--
to
deal
with
this.
they
tried
other
things.
they
--
and
the
evidence,
therefore,
supported
this.
what
would
it
take
to
support
a
broader
statute?
it's
hard
for
me
to
say,
but
i
think
this
record
shows.
justice
kagan,
can
i--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
broad
statute
and
hard
--
hard
to
defend.
but
if
there
were
before
the
legislature,
as
there
is
in
this
case,
the
kind
of
congestion
--
and
the
solution,
i
submit,
is
much
narrower
than
the
petitioners
are
suggesting.
it
is
to
clear
out
an
area
around
the
entrance.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
justice
kagan,
the
testimony
is
22
feet
from
the
entrance
in
boston,
22
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
doorway
to
the
edge
of
the
--
of
the
buffer
zone.
it
is
from
me
to
the
marshal.
it
is
not
to
the
back
of
the
courtroom.
it
is
--
it
is
an
nba
3-point
zone.
i
don't
--
it
is
not
the--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
standard
they
use,
but
it
is
a--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
cases
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
thank
you.
