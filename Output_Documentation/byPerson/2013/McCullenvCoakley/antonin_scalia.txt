justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
should
probably
ask
this
of
the
other
side,
and
i
will,
but
do
you
happen
to
know
when
was
the
last
time
that
massachusetts
prosecuted
somebody
for
obstructing
entrance
to
an
abortion
clinic?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
have
been
laws
against
obstruction
during
this
entire
period,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
only
once,
in
1997,
that
was
the
last
time
a
prosecution
was
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
schneider,
they
were
held
not
so
far
back
that
their
shouts
and
protests
couldn't
be
heard.
isn't
that
the
case?
they
could
still
be
heard--
justice
antonin
scalia
--out
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--counsel,
do
you
accept
that
the
record
here
shows
that
it
did
not
work
well
in
the
sense
that
justice
breyer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--seems
to
use
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
recall
the
record,
all
--
all
it
says
is
that
the
police
found
it
difficult
to
apply
a
bubble;
that,
you
know,
they
have
to
measure
8
feet
or
whatever
it
is.
they
didn't
say
that
massive
obstruction
and
protests
are
occurring,
preventing
people
from
--
that
wasn't
the
finding,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
know
they're
going
to
the
clinic.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
case,
isn't
it,
that
not
only
abortion
counselors
are
--
are
excluded
from
this
area,
everybody
is,
right?
anybody
who
wants
to
talk
to
anybody
or
who
just
wants
to
be
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can't
--
i
mean,
this
is
a
--
a
dead
speech
zone,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
if
--
if
you're
going
through
the
zone
just
to
get
somewhere,
not
to
get
to
the
clinic,
and
you're
walking
with
a
companion,
can't
you
speak
to
your
companion
as
you
--
it
doesn't
ban
speech
by
everybody
who's
walking
through.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
a
protest
case.
these
people
don't
want
to
protest
abortion.
they
want
to
talk
to
the
women
who
are
about
to
get
abortions
and
try
to
talk
them
out
of
it.
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
distorts
it
to
say
that
what
they
want
to
do
is
protest
abortion.
if
it
was
a
protest,
keeping
them
back
35
feet
might
not
be
so
bad.
they
can
scream
and
yell
and
hold
up
signs
from
35
feet.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
try
to
talk
the
woman
out
of
the
abortion.
it's
a
counseling
case,
not
a
--
not
a
protest
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
surely
you
could
have
a
law
against
screaming
and
shouting
within
35
feet
or
protesting
within
35
feet.
isn't
that
more
narrowly
tailored?
i
mean,
what
this
case
involves,
what
these
people
want
to
do
is
to
speak
quietly
and
in
a
friendly
manner,
not
in
a
hostile
manner,
because
that
would
--
that
would
frustrate
their
purpose,
with
the
people
going
into
the
clinic.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
say
yes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
it.
it's
a
permissible
purpose
to
say
this
is
a
safe
facility,
but
not
a
permissible
purpose
to
say
this
is
an
unsafe
facility?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
--
i
object
to
you
calling
these
people
protestors,
which
you've
been
doing
here
during
the
whole
presentation.
that
is
not
how
they
present
themselves.
they
do
not
say
they
want
to
make
protests.
they
say
they
want
to
talk
quietly
to
the
women
who
are
going
into
these
facilities.
now
how
does
that
make
them
protestors?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
testimony
by
the
--
by
the
clinics
themselves,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
alternative
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
standing
35
feet
away
and
yelling?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
alternative?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
comfort
these
women?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
know
who's
going
into
the
clinic.
justice
antonin
scalia
until
you
get
to
the
area
close
to
the
clinic,
you
don't
know
whether
passersby
are
going
there
or
not.
