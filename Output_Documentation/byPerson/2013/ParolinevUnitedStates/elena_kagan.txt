justice
elena
kagan
mr.
schneider,
on
your
view
if
only
one
person
viewed
the
pornography,
that
person
would
be
responsible
for
the
entire
damages,
but
if
a
thousand
people
viewed
the
pornography
and
the
harm
was
that
much
greater,
nobody
would
be
in
--
would
be
on
the
hook
for
restitution.
how
could
that
possibly
make
sense?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
could
you
say
more
about
that?
you
said
that
the
chief
justice's
question
was
right,
that
it
doesn't
work
for
the
first
person
and
you
said
there
are
better
ones.
what
are
the
better
ones?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
you
know
--
i
mean,
it
struck
me
when
i
read
your
brief
that
it
said,
i
don't
know
why
these
courts
started
where
they
started,
whether
each
violation
is
worth
1,000
or
5,000
or
50,000.
and
it
seems
as
though
somebody
just
plucks
an
initial
number
out
of
the
air
and
then
everything
is
pegged
to
that
initial
number,
but
that
the
initial
number
has
nothing
in
particular
behind
it
or
am
i
--
is
it
more
sensible
than
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
are
not
claiming,
are
you
--
or
are
you?
that
she's
been
victimized
to
the
tune
of
3.4
million
as
a
result
of
this
particular
defendant's
offense?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
contributed
to.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
take
it
that
the
point
of
the
government's
submission
is
only
contributed
to
and
now
we
have
to
sort
of
approximate
what
the
contribution
was.
and
you
come
in
and
you
say,
no,
it
shouldn't
be
--
notwithstanding
that
this
particular
offense
was
responsible
for
only
a
part,
you
think
the
defendant
should
be
liable
for
the
whole.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i'm
just
not
sure
what
that
means,
contributed
to
$100.
does
that
mean
she's
--
the
defendant
is
responsible
for
the
entire
$100--
justice
elena
kagan
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
or
does
it
mean
that
the
defendant
is
responsible
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
some
lesser
part
of
the
entire
harm?
justice
elena
kagan
i
--
i
guess
i'm
--
when
i
say
responsible
i
don't
mean
as
a
legal
conclusion.
i
mean
did
the
defendant
cause
the
entire
$100
of
harm?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
full
amount--
justice
elena
kagan
--from
the
particular
offense,
mr.
cassell,
so
that
it's
the
full
amount
of
whatever
the
particular
offense
caused.
but
you're
not
saying
that
this
defendant
caused
the
entire
3.4.
justice
elena
kagan
usually
when
we
approve
joint
and
several
liability
we
do
so
against
a
background
of
a
functioning
system
of
contribution
where
one
defendant
pays
the
entire
thing,
but
then
can
go
after--
justice
elena
kagan
--other
defendants
and
be
pretty
well
assured
that
he
gets
their
share.
now,
here,
there's
nothing
like
that
and
the
question
--
i
guess
the
question
is
you're
asking
us
to
impose
that
kind
of
system
without
the
usual
thing
that
goes
along
with
it,
which
is
a
sharing
mechanism.
