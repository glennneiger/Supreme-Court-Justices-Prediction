mr.
stanley
g
schneider
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
statutory
construction.
specifically
under
18
u.s.c.
2259,
must
a
victim's
--
victim's
losses
be
proximally
caused
by
a
defendant's
offense
conduct
before
a
sentencing
judge
can
award
restitution.
the
short
answer
to
the
question
is
all
losses
must
be
proximately
caused.
eleven
courts
of
appeals
and
the
government
agree
that
this
circuit
ignored
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
and
the
enumerated
enforcement
provisions
of
3664
to
craft
a
restitution
scheme
where
the
possession
of
two
images
of
child
pornography
resulted
in
the
award
of
$3.4
million
to
doyle
paroline
which
was
strictly,
jointly
and
severally
liable.
and
my
time
before
the
court
was
to
address
first
why
the
fifth
circuit
decision
is
incorrect,
and
second,
why
the
government's
concept
of
aggregate
causation
conflicts
with
its
statutory
burden
of
proof
contained
in
3664(e).
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
well,
i
think
there
has
to
be
--
in
all
restitution
cases,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
person's
conduct
caused
the
harm
and
losses.
and
harm
and
losses
are
two
different
things.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
that's
a
fact-intensive
question
and
that's
what
the
district
court
has
to
determine,
whether
on
the
facts
presented,
there
are
identifiable
losses
that
were
caused
by
the
defendant's
conduct
and
there
can
be.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
well--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--i
think
they
go
hand
in
hand
because
when
dealing
with
proximate
cause,
would
the
conduct
--
is
the
losses
the
natural
sequence
from
the
conduct
and
the
result.
and
what
we're
dealing
with
is
would
the
losses
have
occurred
but
for
the
conduct.
and
in
this
situation
--
in
this
case
where
the
damage
model
was
created
six
months
before
the
notice
is
received,
then
you
don't
have
the
relationship
between
the
loss
and
the
conduct
or
the
notice
of
the
conduct.
and
it's
a
real
problem.
but
the
--
the
important
consideration
in
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
the
government's
burden
of
proof
under
3664(e).
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
justice
kennedy,
the
problem
with
aggregate
causation
does
not
apply--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--it
would
be
a
harm,
but
not--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--but
the
problem
is
when
you're
dealing
with
aggregate
causation,
that
conflicts
with
the
statutory
burden
of
proof
that
the
government
has
under
3664(e),
which
is
made
applicable
to
the
2059
under
section
(b)(2),
and
you'll
find
3664(e)
at
appendix
22
to
our
merits
brief.
the--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--only
if
--
if
the
losses
are
the
result
of
the
offense,
because
the
government's
burden
of
proof
is
that
they
must
demonstrate
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
losses
sustained
by
the
victim
are
the
result
of
the
offense.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
it's
on
the
indictment.
only
one
person
is
charged
and--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--he's
not
--
it's
not
in
the
indictment.
no
one
else
is
in
--
is
in
front
of
the
sentencing
judge.
the
statute
3664(e)
and
section
(f),
(b)(3)(f),
all
talk
about
"the
offense",
and
"the
offense"
is
normally
--
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
you
talk
about
"the
offense",
it's
the
offense
of
conviction.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
justice
kagan,
that's
not
what
--
there
are
numerous
cases
where
someone
who
looks
at
--
possesses
child
pornography
has
been
shown
to
be
liable
for
losses
and
restitution
and
some
individual
cases
that
it's
not.
and
it's
fewer
cases
than
not
are,
again,
no
restitution
because
there's
no
losses.
the
losses
in
--
it
all
depends
on
the
facts.
in
this
case,
the
district
judge
carefully
weighed
the
evidence.
in
this
case,
unlike
any
other
case,
there
are
competing
experts
that
the
judge,
district
judge,
played
--
acted
as
a
gatekeeper
of
the
forensic
science
and
with
the
challenge
to
the
methodology
that
was
presented
by
amy's
experts,
the
judge
left
no
alternative
because
there
was
no
explanation.
and
that
methodology,
faulty
methodology,
was
part
of
his
decision
that
he
recognized.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
and
--
and
the
answer
is
to
--
multifaceted
because
the
government's
burden
of
proof
for
restitution
applies
to
all
restitution
statutes.
it's
the
same
standard.
and
you
can't
carve
out
one
standard
of
causation
for
one
crime
because
it's
a
heinous
crime
and,
as
repugnant
as
child
pornography
is,
the
standard
of
causation
has
to
be
the
same--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--well,
in
some
of
the
cases
there's
evidence
that
--
of
not
--
of
the
victim
having
knowledge
of
an
individual
and
in
that
case
--
those
cases,
there
have
been
awards
of
restitution,
some
of
them
3,000,
5,000,
15,000,
30,000.
but
there's
some
knowledge
and
there's
some
evidence
for
a
judge
to
base
a
finding
of
causation
to
the
award
of
restitution.
and
it's
a
fact-based
determination.
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
for
which
the
judge
makes
his
determination.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
i
don't
--
and
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
in
the
second
circuit
in
lundquist
was
an
amy
case
where
there
was
a
finding
of
losses
and
restitution.
and
the
court,
the
second
circuit,
specifically
addressed
how
to
calculate
it.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
precise.
we're
not
saying
it
has
to
be
a
precise
determination,
but
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
for
which
a
judge
can
base
a
determination
that
ties
the
losses
in
this
case
to
the
conduct.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
no,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
the
district
judge
made
a
determination
as
the
gatekeeper
of
the
forensic
science
that
the
government
didn't
prove
its
case.
if
you
look--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--lundquist
is
a
perfect
example
where
there
are
two
reports
by
their
expert
explaining
how
the
knowledge
of
--
of
an
individual
of
lundquist
affected
her
treatment,
affected
her
day-to-day
life,
and
their
specific
report
talks
about
knowledge
of
the
--
this
individual.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
by--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--justice
scalia,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
--
is
multifaceted
and--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--i
understand.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
and
congress
dictated
that
all
victims
who
are
identified
receive
notice
and
that
notice
goes
to
her
lawyer.
and
in
the
later
cases
--
in
the
recent
cases,
she's
been
notified
of
every
single
one
of
those
notices
that
are
received.
and
appropriate
counseling
has
been
given
in
all
the
later
cases.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
i
think
in
wright
it
was
$500,000
was
the
court's
order,
i
believe.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
no.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
thank
you.
this
--
this
is
a
criminal
sentencing
problem.
and
congress
in
1996
apparently
codified
--
codified
this
court's
opinion
in
hughey
in
creating
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
to
demonstrate
that
the
losses
sustained
by
the
victim
are
the
result
of
the
offense
and
created
a
number
of
new
mandatory
restitution
statutes
that
apply.
and
that
doesn't
change.
so
as
the
reading
--
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute
points
--
with
the
government's
burden
of
proof
requires
that
the
government
demonstrate
that,
for
example,
the
medical
services
losses
of
the
victim
of
child
pornography
are
caused
by
--
are
the
result
of
the
defendant's
offense.
and
that's
what
congress
intended
by
adopting
--
of
3664(e)
and
placing
it
as
the
enforcement
provision
of
each
of
the
restitution
statutes
that
it
created
in
1996.
it
codified
hughey.
and
what
the
idea
of
contribution
suggests
that
convicted
sex
offenders
across
the
country
are
going
to
get
together
and
see
who
pays
what
to
whom.
that's
not
what
congress
intended.
this
is
a
sentencing
proceeding
that
requires
a
particularized,
individualized
sentence
based
upon
criminal
conduct.
and
that's
what
--
what
the
--
what
congress
intended
when
it
created
all
these
statutes.
the
ideal
solution
is
to
say,
congress,
make
each
defendant
pay
$1,000
per
image.
that
would
be
--
into
a
fund
for
restitution
for
victims.
and
that--
mr.
stanley
g
schneider
--there
will
always
be
--
if
there's
two
offenders
that
are
caught,
you
may
get
restitution
from
one
of
them.
but
if
--
but
you're
looking
at
what
a
single
judge
has
to
sentence
someone.
a
single
judge,
like
judge
davis,
had
one
defendant.
he
didn't
have
a
defendant
in
florida
or
maine
or
oregon
to
see
what
that
person's
background
was.
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
a
psr.
he
has
to
look
at
one
person.
and
in
this
case,
the
district
court
balanced
two
experts
and
the
methodology
that
was
challenged
and
simply
said,
i
find
she
was
a
victim.
i
find
that
she
was
harmed.
but
the
government
didn't
meet
its
statutory
burden
of
proof
in
this
case,
and
in
many
other
cases
there
is
losses
proved.
and
there's
a
difference
between
harm
and
loss.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
exactly
what
the
government
wanted
them
to
do.
weigh
the
evidence,
listen
to
the
evidence,
look
at
the
defendant
and
see
if
the
government
met
its
burden.
and
what
we'd
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
and
affirm
the
district
court.
thank
you
very
much.
