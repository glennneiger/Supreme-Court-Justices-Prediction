justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
the
answer,
though,
to
the
problem,
forgetting
this
case?
there's
a
problem
in
child
pornography
cases.
congress
clearly
wants
restitution.
makes
sense
to
me.
but
if
a
thousand
people
look
at
it,
then
each
one
can
say:
but
i
didn't
cause
more
than
a
tiny
fraction
at
most,
and
so
there
virtually
is
no
restitution;
right?
now,
every
one
of
the
thousand
says
that,
truthfully,
and
so
therefore
the
victim
gets
no
restitution
--
opposite
of
what
congress
wanted.
but
their
answer
in
the
lower
court
was:
we'll
make
each
one
of
those
thousand
liable
for
the
whole
thing.
the
government's
answer
is
aggregate
cause.
it's
called
a
concept
that
they've
sort
of
created,
but
it's
there
to
answer
the
problem.
what's
your
answer
to
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
it
is.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
suppose
that
it
does.
if
you
have
the
same
problem,
you
have
the
same
problem.
where
there
--
you
understand.
so
how
--
how
do
we
answer
this
problem?
and
the
difficulty
of
saying
--
dividing
--
the
government
doesn't
find
a
thousand.
you
know,
it
only
finds
two
or
three.
and
so
you're
going
to
be
997
who
escape.
and
those
three,
what
should
they
pay?
what
--
should
they
pay
nothing?
should
they
pay
the
whole
thing?
should
we
do
it
somewhere
in
between?
how
--
just
restating
the
problem
and
--
and
you
have
experience
in
this
field.
so
what
do
you
really
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
with
ease
say,
look,
it's
very
complicated.
i
can
think
of
some
answers,
but
they're
too
complicated
for
me
to
tell
you
what
they
are.
and
justice
scalia
has
a
possible
answer.
justice
alito,
it
seemed
to
me,
is
pointing
out
that
the
second
person
to
look
at
the
thing,
if
they're
only
two,
probably
adds
a
lot
of
damage,
but
the
1000th
person
compared
to
999
is
near
zero.
now,
do
we
count
this
defendant
as
number
2
or
do
we
count
him
as
number
1000?
very
hard
to
answer,
no
answer
really.
but
can
we
say,
we
can't
answer
how
you
do
this
in
practice.
leave
it
to
the
sentencing
commission.
that's
their
job.
now,
can
we
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
can
we
say
--
can
we
suggest
that
the
sentencing
commission
--
you
can't
order
them
to
do
it,
of
course
not.
but
can
we
suggest
that
this
is
the
kind
of
problem,
very
difficult,
technically
several
ways
to
do
it,
that
they
can
go
into
this.
is
that
true,
that
they
could
go
into
it
and
recommend
or
perhaps
order?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
the
person
didn't
cause
the
full
amount.
i
mean,
do
you
think
congress
didn't
intend
--
do
they
want
to
have
people
pay
for
injury
they
didn't
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
think
he
caused
the
full
amount,
fine.
but
i
mean,
immediately
you'll
say
at
least
they
have
four
other
people
that
they
prosecuted
for
this,
and
those
people
caused
it
just
as
much.
and
so
let's
divide
it
by
five.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
contributed
also
a
person
who
didn't
have
a
picture
of
her
but
watched
other
victims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
person
contributed
to
her
too,
because
it
creates
a
market
for
the
entire
situation.
so
some
limiting
principle
has
to
come
into
play,
and
the
limiting
principle
that
i
think
people
are
driving
at
is
because
there's
a
terrible
crime,
we
don't
convict
the
person
who
didn't
do
it,
all
right?
and
similarly,
because
this
is
a
terrible
crime,
you
don't
require
a
person
to
pay
what
he
didn't
cause.
now,
that's
sort
of
a
principle
going
on.
now,
if
you
accept
that,
at
least
hypothetically,
can
you
give
any
answer
--
i'm
afraid
you
can't
and
you're
going
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
answer
to
what
seems
to
be
bothering
me
and
a
lot
of
others
is,
okay,
let's
accept
the
notion
of
cause,
but
what
is
a
--
this
is
called
restitution--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
isn't
called
fines.
and
so,
given
that,
what
--
how
do
you
do
it?
how
do
you
distinguish
so
she
gets
some
reasonable
amount?
how
do
you
do
it
that
you're
--
i
can
think
of
--
we've
had
about
four
different
suggestions
here.
but
what's
your
opinion,
if
you
lose
on
the
first?
what's
the
best
way
to
do
it?
that's
what
i
think
people
are
struggling
for
--
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
suspected
you
would
say.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
doing
--
what
you'd
say
is
make
the
department,
you
can
find
out
figures,
you
could
find
out
from
figures
what's
the
likelihood
that
x
number
of
people
will
be
caught.
and
say
it's
3
out
of
1,000.
then
what
you
do
is
you
divide
by
three.
i
mean,
that
way
everybody
would
be
treated
fairly,
and
moreover,
the
victim
would
at
least
have
a
shot
at
getting--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
how
many
--
how
many
are
going
to
get
caught
and
convicted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can
find
out.
there's
no
--
it's
not
an
impossible
question
for
people
to
come
in
and
use
the
numbers
and
figure
it
out.
my
guess
would
be
a
very
tiny
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
then
she's
going
to
get
a
lot
of
her
--
then
she's
going
to
get
from
each
one
a
pretty
good
share,
only--
