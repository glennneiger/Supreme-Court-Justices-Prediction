chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-8561,
paroline
v.
united
states.
mr.
schneider.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
individual
at
least
cause
some
harm
without
regard
to
the
harm
caused
by
the
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
yes.
now,
why
isn't
it
the
case
--
why
can't
the
--
why
can't
amy
have
an
expert
that
comes
in
and
testifies
as
a
result
of
their
experience
that
the
psychological
harm
caused
by
knowing
that
those
images
are
available
to
others,
have
been
viewed
by
someone
else,
will
require,
on
average,
whatever,
a
certain
amount
of
counseling
for
a
certain
amount
of
time?
so
that
the
one
individual
is
responsible
for
that
harm,
regardless
of
what
else
happens.
now,
he
may
say,
well,
it's
kind
of
unfair
to
stick
me
with
that,
but
that's
a
different
question
than
the
aggregate
causation
issue
that
you're
addressing.
if
you
have
expert
testimony,
and
there
will
be
expert
testimony
on
the
other
side,
that
says
it
normally
requires
counseling
for
someone
when
they
find
out,
without
regard
to
anything
else,
that
an
individual
has
viewed
this,
why
doesn't
that
require
or
at
least
allow
assessment
of
the
--
the
whole
amount?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
my
hypothetical
is
not
aggregate
causation.
it
is
that
this
individual
caused
this
harm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
that
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
that
work
for
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
one
--
just
one
moment.
how
does
that
work
for
the
first
person?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
makes
no
--
i
mean,
how
do
you
tell
the
difference--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how
do
you
tell
--
your
model,
how
does
it
work
if
it
turns
out
that
the
damages
are
a
million
dollars
as
opposed
to
$3.4
million?
is
it
still
$1200
per
offender?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
expect
--
you
would
expect
the
defendant
in
a
case
where
the
restitution
sought
is
a
million
dollars
to
pay
50
percent
of
what
he
would
pay
if
the
damages
were
$2
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cassell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
responsible
for
those
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
offense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
only
offense
shown
here
in
this
case
is
the
possession
of
the
two
pictures.
so
how
--
how
can
all
of
those
amounts
be
the
result
of
the
possession
of
two
pictures?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
understand
the
statutory
principle
that
it
says
"any
other
losses
suffered
by
the
victim
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
offense.
"
which
suggests
that
the
prior
losses
are
also
limited
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
offense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
it
make
sense
to
say
that
he's
liable
for
lost
income,
whether
or
not
it's
a
proximate
result,
but
when
it
comes
to
other
losses
suffered
by
the
victim,
they
have
to
be
the
proximate
result?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
to
--
your
point
was
that
all
of
the
(a)
through
(e)
is
limited,
and
you
don't
need
--
well,
it's
not.
one
of
the
losses
that
can
be
gained
--
recovered
is
lost
income.
now,
if
you
take
away
proximate
cause,
the
argument
can
be,
well,
i
had
to
undergo
counseling
in
a
particular
period,
so
i
wasn't
able
to
get
a
master's
degree
in
this.
because
i
didn't
get
a
master's
degree,
i
wasn't
able
to
get
a
better-paying
job,
and
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
the
income
from
the
better-paying
job
that
i
would
have
gotten
if
i
had
a
master's
degree
if
i
didn't
have
to
take
the
counseling.
now,
unless
you
limit
that
by
proximate
cause
it's
entirely
open-ended.
it's
not
confined
as
you
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
proximate
causation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
not
a
simple
case.
you
said,
rhetorical
exaggeration,
every
word
in
the
statute
leads
to
that.
but
the
key
words
don't.
the
key
words
are
"proximate
result
of
the
offense".
and
it's
difficult
to
argue
that
the
entire
amount
is
a
proximate
result
of
the
offense
of
two
pictures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schneider,
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
