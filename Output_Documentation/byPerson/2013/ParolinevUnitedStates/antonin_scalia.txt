justice
antonin
scalia
the
particular
individual?
she
has
to
know
each
individual
who
--
who
has
been
viewing
her
rape
on
--
on
these
pornographic
items
that
have
been
distributed
widely?
she
has
to
know
each
individual
or
she
can't
be
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
woman
has
undergone
serious
psychiatric
harm
because
of
her
knowledge
that
there
are
thousands
of
people
out
there
viewing
her
rape.
but
you
say
she
can't
--
why
isn't
your
client
at
least
responsible
for
some
of
that?
even
without
her
knowing
him,
he
had
two
of
her
pictures.
he's
one
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
viewed
--
who
viewed
her
rape.
so
why
can't
she
recover
some
amount
from
him?
i
mean,
the
other
side
says
she
ought
to
be
able
to
recover
everything
from
him.
you
say
she
ought
to
be
able
to
recover
nothing.
what
about
something
in
between?
what
about
figuring
out
how
much
of
--
of
her
total
psychiatric
damage
and
all
the
expenses
and
what-not
are
attributable
to
this
particular
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
that
for
another
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
one
facet.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
well,
now
--
not
because
tort
law
has
developed
that.
i
mean,
i
frankly
don't
agree
with
what
you
say
modern
tort
law
is
supposed
to
allow,
and
--
and
keeton,
you
know,
doesn't
really
establish
that
that's
what
the
courts
now
do.
but
even
without
agreeing
with
that,
can't
i
find
that
that
is
the
system
that
this
statute
intended
to
impose?
i
mean,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
so
the
question
is
not
what
does
modern
tort
law
allow,
but
the
question
is
what
reasonably
could
congress
have
meant
by
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i'm
not
going
to
go
along
with
you
on,
you
know,
modern
tort.
i
think
that's
nonsense.
i
don't
think
it's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
deny
but-for.
i
haven't
understood
your
submission
to
be
that
there
need
not
be
but-for
cause
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
--
you're
confusing
whether
there's
a
specific
amount
of
harm
caused
with
whether
it
is
easy
to
measure
that
harm.
the
--
the
tort
cases
you
refer
to
are
cases
in
which
there
is
a
result
produced
that
is
not
severable.
you
can't
say
this
person
is
--
you
know,
accounts
for
this
much
of
it,
such
as
pollution,
all
the
pollution
there.
the
stream
is
polluted.
that's
quite
different
from
this
case
where
--
where
this
--
this
young
woman
has
been
subjected
to
psychological
harm
because
of
thousands
of
people
viewing
her
rape.
now,
this
--
she
would
be
subjected
to
less
psychological
harm
if
it
was
just
one
person
or
ten
people
or
a
hundred
people.
in
other
words,
each
person
increases
the
amount
of
her
psychological
harm.
it
is
severable
the
way
the
tort
cases
you
refer
to
are
not.
and
so
why
shouldn't
the
question
in
this
case
be
simply
he
caused
a
certain
incremental
amount
of
psychological
harm
to
--
to
this
woman
and
he
should
pay
for
it
and
it's
up
to
the
district
court
to
decide
what
the
proper
amount
of
that
payment
ought
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
they're
certainly
not
using
your
theory.
even
though
it's
not
plucked
out
of
the
air,
they're
certainly
not
using
your
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
so
they're
using
some
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
no
idea
what
that
is
and
can't
suggest
one,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
sensible--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
wonderful
and,
you
know,
i
--
i
want
to
go
along
with
you.
this
is
a
bad
guy
and
--
and
he
ought
to
be
punished
and
he
ought
to
give
restitution,
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
due
process
of
law.
and
what
you're
saying
is
--
i
have
no
idea
how
much
he's
going
to
be
required
to
turn
over,
whether
it's
going
to
be
--
what
was
it
in
this
case,
$3
million?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
idea
what
he's
going
to
be
socked
with,
and
that's
not
what
we
usually
do
with
criminal
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
can't
say
leave
it
up
to
the
district
judge,
you
know,
and
they
all
come
out
different
ways,
but
who
cares,
it's
--
you
know,
so
long
as
it's
within
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--some
reasonable
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
not
the
way
we
do
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
because
the
statute
says
so.
it
says
you
get
from,
you
know,
10
to
20
years,
okay?
but
the
statute
here
doesn't
say,
you
know,
you'll
--
you'll
get
between
this
and
this,
whatever
the
district
judge
likes.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
you
--
you
should
compensate
the
victim
for
what
--
for
what
you've
caused
her.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
a
fudge
factor
here?
can
a
--
can
a
district
judge
use
what
he
calls
a
fudge
factor?
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
it's
not
a
tort
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
going
to
be
liable
for
a
fudge
factor.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
two
pictures.
he
did
not
distribute
at
all.
he
was
not
a
distributor,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
convicted
of
possessing
two
pictures.
and
the
statute
doesn't
even
require
intentional
possession,
just
knowing
possession,
right?
he
could
have
gotten
them
by
accident.
he
knew
he
got
them,
but
he
never
took
them
off
of
his
computer,
but
he's
still
guilty
of
the
crime.
so
i
--
he's
guilty,
he's
guilty
of
the
crime.
but
to
sock
him
for
all
of
her
--
all
of
her
psychiatric
costs
and
everything
else
because
he
had
two
pictures
of
her?
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
justice
sotomayor
and
like
the
government
here,
i
think,
even
if
there
is
a
proximate
cause
requirement,
it
has
been
--
it
has
been
met,
once
you
adopt
the
aggregate
offense
notion.
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
subsection
(f).
my
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
--
whether
or
not
you
read
the
proximate
cause
element
in
(f)
into
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
(e),
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
to
read
into
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
(e)
is
the
portion
of
(f)
which
says
"any
other
losses
suffered
by
the
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense.
"
--"of
the
offense".
is
it
only
(f)
that
is
limited
to
the
particular
offense,
and
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
(e)
means
those
--
those
items
that
come
from
anybody
else's
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
should
contribute
to
the
payment.
you're
saying
contributed
to
the
harm,
but
he
makes
100
percent
of
the
payment.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
much
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
say
from
that
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
subsequent
legislative
history?
is
that
what
this
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
those
that
like
legislative
history
don't
like
subsequent
legislative
history.
[laughter]
