mr.
paul
g.
cassell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
remarkably,
this
morning,
the
other
parties
have
taken
a
statute
that
promises
amy
she
will
receive
restitution
for
all
of
her
losses
and
interpreted
it
to
be
a
statute
that
has
fudge
factors,
imprecision,
estimation,
to
produce
some
kind
of
an
award
that
in
the
government's
view
is
fair.
that's
not
what
congress
provided
in
this
particular
statute.
congress
answered
the
question
presented.
you
were
asking,
justice
breyer,
what's
the
amount?
the
text
of
the
statute
tells
us.
it
is
the
full
amount.
here,
amy
has
put
forward--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--we
disagree
with
your
premise
there,
with
all
respect.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
the
solution
to
the
point
that
you're
raising,
justice
breyer,
is
to
recognize
that
petitioner
was
a
contributing
cause
to
all
of
amy's
losses.
amy's
losses
come
from
a
vast
faceless
anonymous
crowd
of
thousands
of
people
scattered
around
the
globe
from
denver
to
denmark
who
are
looking
at
pictures
of
her
being
raped
as
an
eight-year-old
girl.
and
that
aggregate
group
of
people
all
contribute
to
a
loss.
and
i'm
sure
that
your
honor
is
familiar
with
cases
from
this
court,
for
example
the
norfolk
&
western
case
where
asbestos
manufacturers
all
contributed
to
a
particular
loss.
the
result
in
that
case
was
joint
and
several
liability.
each
person
who
contributed
to
the
loss
was
on
the
hook
for
the
damages
in
their
entirety.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no,
justice
kennedy.
what
congress
assumed
is
that
he
would
contribute
to
a
single
loss,
and
then
at
that
point
he
would
be
responsible--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--i'm
sorry.
loss.
he
contributed
to
the
loss,
and
it's
important
to
understand--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
congress
did
intend
that,
your
honor.
they
said
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
full
amount
of
the
losses.
there's
a
two-step
process
here.
first,
this
particular
defendant
caused
harm
to
this
particular
victim.
that's
the
victim
definition
found
in
2259(c).
and
there
are
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
that
the
defendant,
petitioner,
did
harm
--
did
harm
amy.
and
then
at
that
point
the
only
question
left
under
this
mandatory
restitution
statute
is,
how
much
restitution
does
she
get?
and
congress
has
answered
that
question.
she
gets
the
full
amount,
for
five
itemized
categories
of
losses,
psychological
counseling
being
the
most
prominent.
she's
documented
with
detailed
submissions
that
she
is
going
to
bear--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--the
language
you
have
quoted,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
from
subsection
(f).
amy
is
not
seeking
any
recovery
under
subsection
(f).
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
would
ask
you
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit's
en
banc
decision,
which
disagreed
with
that
reading.
there
are
numerous
canons
of
statutory
construction--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--there
are
a
number
of
answers
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
"any
other
losses"
is
potentially
open-ended.
it
includes
such
things
as
emotional
distress
damages
that
could
be
potentially
uncapped.
(a)
through
(e),
however,
are
all
out-of-pocket
pecuniary
costs.
they
are
defined.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
defined
with
precision
what
the
course
of
lifetime
psychological
counseling
costs
will
be
for
amy.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
i
think
we
win
either
way,
and
obviously
i
have
to
anticipate
that
there
may
be
a
variety
of
views
on
this
very
difficult
question.
but
let's
assume
that
the
court
wants
to
read
proximate
cause
into
other
parts
of
the
statute
where
it
does
not
appear.
at
that
point,
the
question
simply
becomes
what
do
we
mean
by
proximate
cause?
proximate
cause
is
a
legal
shorthand
for
scope
of
the
risk,
a
legal
duty.
and
congress
has
defined
the
legal
duty
here.
for
those
criminals
who
commit
a
serious
10-year
federal
felony,
the
scope
of
their
risk
is
they
will
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
psychological
counseling
costs--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
there
--
you're
talking
about
the
problem
of
but-for
causation.
then
what
kind
of
additional
limitation
will
placed
on
it.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
right.
so
there
would
be
an
additional
cause,
which
the
government
argues
should
be
a
proximate
cause
limitation,
but
there
are
other
limitations
that
could
be
attached.
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
did.
it
said,
for
example,
that
if
amy
suffered
a
car
accident
on
the
way
to
therapy,
that
that
would
not
be
included.
why?
because
contextually
and
conventionally
we
would
not
refer
to
those
types
of
losses
as
stemming
from
child
pornography.
that's
proximate
cause.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no.
the
linkage
--
the
particular
defendant's
conviction
comes
from
subsection
(c)
a
victim
such
as
amy
has
to
establish
that
she's
been
harmed
as
a
result
of
this
defendant's
crime.
that
establishes
--
there's
been
a
reference
to
aggregate
cause.
we
think
the
way
to
look
at
this
would
be--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--as
a
result
of
this
defendant's
offense.
we
agree
that
subsection
(c)
requires
amy
to
show
that
she
was
victimized
by
this
defendant.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
we
are
saying
that
she
--
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
defendant,
contributed
to
all
of
the
losses
that
she
suffered.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
yes.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
we
think
that
the
defendant
contributed
to
all
her
losses.
let
me
give
you
a
quick
illustration.
next
week
when
amy
goes
to
her
therapist
and
is
billed
$100,
the
defendant
contributed
to
all
$100.
and
of
course
all
we
have
when
we
get
to
the
additional
numbers
down
the
road
is
simply
the
fact
that
she's
going
to
be
going
to
therapy,
not
just
next
week--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--yes.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no,
the
first.
he's
responsible,
he
is
a
contributing
cause
of
the
entire
amount.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
he
contributed
to
the
entire
$100,
just
as
multiple
polluters
contribute
to
asbestosis--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
justice
scalia,
we're
pure
textualists
on
this.
when
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
congress
has
answered
that
question.
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
different
ways,
but
they
said
that
she
is
entitled
to
recover
the
full
amount
of
her
loss--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--we're
saying
he
contributed
to
the
entire
3.4--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--along
with
the
other
people.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no,
i
--
you
can't
disaggregate
them,
and
that's
the
fundamental
problem
here.
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
our
amicus
brief
with
the
american
professional
association
involved
with
the
sexual
abuse
of
children,
what
they
say
is
you
cannot
tease
out
this
particular
defendant
or
this
particular
harm.
they
all
come
together
to--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
no--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--no,
i'm--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--yes.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
to
give
amy
the
full
amount
of
her
losses
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
that's
our
answer,
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
wanted.
congress
wanted
to
take
these
vulnerable
victims,
child
pornography
crimes,
federal
sex
offense
crimes,
and
domestic
violence,
and
get
them
full
restitution
as
quickly
and
effectively
as
possible.
and
then
after
that,
if
there's
a
need
to
send
an
additional
message
to
a
defendant,
he
can
be
fined
up
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
or
sent
to
prison
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
yes.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
as
of
yesterday,
1,752,000.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
certainly.
absolutely.
no,
we're
not
asking
for
double
recovery.
amy
simply
wants
to
be
made
whole.
she
wants
to
recover
her
psychological
counseling
costs
and
her
losses.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
right.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
we
disagree
with
the
premise
here.
the
background
principle
for
intentional
tortfeasors
is
they
got
stuck
with
the
entire
liability
jointly
and
severally.
that
was
the
common
law
approach.
now,
if
you
want
to
deviate
from
the
common
law
approach
and
read
a
contribution
action
into
the
statute,
we're
certainly
not
opposed
to
that.
but
the
overriding
goal
of
congress,
as
it
always
is
when
they
deal
with
criminal,
intentional
tortfeasors,
is
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
victims
and
less
about
some
notion
of
distributing
losses
among
criminally
culpable
defendants.
congress
doesn't
give
you
any
indication
in
this
statute
that
they
were
concerned
that
one
particular
defendant
might
pay
more
than
his,
quote,
"fair
share",
whatever
that
means.
and
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
government's
position
is
that
after
four
and
a
half
years
of
litigation,
we
still
don't
have
any
indication
as
to
how
much
amy
is
going
to
receive
in
this
particular
case.
what
the
government
proposes
to
do
is
to
cast
district
courts
adrift,
as
they
have
been
for
the
last
four
and
a
half
years,
to
look
at
a
variety
of
the
factors,
including,
remarkably,
if
we
read
the
government's
brief
correctly,
one
of
the
factors
is
the
need
to
get
the
victim
full
--
full
recovery.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
precisely,
until
--
until
the
victim
recovers
the
full
amount.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
but
the
problem
is
in
this
particular
case
the
numbers
show
that
at
least
70,000
people
have
viewed
amy's
image.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
a
tiny
percentage.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
what
you're
assuming,
though,
is
there's
going
to
be
a
steady
stream
of
cases,
that
criminals
aren't
going
to
discover
new
encryption
techniques
to
keep
their
nefarious
activities
secrets.
we
don't
know
whether
there
are
going
to
be
convictions
next
year
or
the
year
following.
and
congress
acted
against
that
understanding
and
said
she
recovers
the
full
amount
from
the
very
first
person,
and
if
she
gets
her
compensation,
then
she's
out
of
the
picture.
and
one
of
the
beauties
of
our
approach
is
that
we
estimate
within
2
to
3
years,
if
you
affirm
the
fifth
circuit,
her
restitution
requests
will
be
done.
if
you
adopt
the
government's
approach,
you
could
be
looking
at
literally
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
where
amy
will
have
to
--
will
have
to
be
filing
piecemeal
restitution
requests,
collecting
as
little
as
$47
under
some
of
the
calculation
theories
that
the
government
has
proposed,
and
there's
no
certainty
that
she's
ever
going
to
get
the
psychological
counseling
costs
that
she
desperately
needs
and
the
lost
income.
now,
certainly
congress
could
have
drafted
the
statute
in
different
ways,
but
every
single
word
or
every
single
phrase
of
this
statute
at
least
indicates
to
you
that
congress
had
one
goal
and
one
goal
alone
in
mind,
that
is
that
victims
get
the
full
amount
of
restitution
that
they
desperately
need.
and
we're
not
talking
here
about
reworking
an
entire
restitution
scheme
for
the
broad
swath
of
federal
crime.
we're
talking
about
three
crimes
covered
by
the
violence
against
women
act,
the
child
pornography
cases,
federal
sexual
assault
cases,
and
domestic
violence
cases.
and
it's
hardly
a
surprise
to
discover
when
you
look
at
the
violence
against
women
act
that
congress
created
a
particularly
expansive
restitution
regime
for
the
victims
of
these
particular
crimes.
and
we
would
direct
your
attention,
for
example,
to
the
bipartisan
amicus
brief
of
a
group
of
senators
who
were
involved
in
the
drafting
of
the
violence
against
women
act,
and
they
indicated
that
their
overriding
goal
here
was
to
make
sure
that
these
vulnerable
victims--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--some
of
the
members
of
the
court
reviewed--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
then
if
you
want
to
go
the
with
the
textual
approach,
this
is
a
simple
case,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
what
happened
was
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contributed
to
the
entire
amount.
and
then
the
way
the
statute
operates
is
a
very
conventional
way.
he
becomes
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
full
amount.
that's
not
some
kind
of
innovation.
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
norfolk
and
western
case
unanimously
said
that
joint
and
several
liability
is
the
traditional
approach.
and
so
what
congress
has
done
here
is
not
create
some
newfangled
regime.
it
has
simply
taken
a
joint
and
several
liability
regime
that
this
court
has
routinely
applied
against
negligent
tortfeasors
and
said,
when
it
comes
to
criminals
who
act
with
scienter,
act
knowingly
or
intentionally
and
cause
harm,
that
they're
going
to
have
to
make
sure
that
the
victims
are
fully
compensated.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
the
defendant
would
--
if
there
was
a
wealthy
defendant
who
was
unhappy
with
the
share
he'd
been
ordered
to
pay,
he
could
simply
try
to
find
other
wealthy
defendants
out
there
and
interplead
them
in
some
kind
of
a
case.
we
admit
that's
going
to
lead
to
litigation
burdens,
that
congress
wanted
those
burdens
on
guilty
criminals
rather
than
innocent
victims.
