why
do
we
--
why
do
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
--
why
should
we
get
to
that
question
when
we
have
what
seems
to
be
a
clear
order
from
congress,
and
it
is
in
2259(a).
it
says:
"the
court
shall
--
shall
order
restitution
for
any
offense
under
this
chapter.
"
it
sounds
like
that's
a
direction
that
if
there's
an
offense
under
this
chapter,
which
is
undisputed
there
is,
the
court
shall
order
restitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
doesn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let
me
ask
you.
you're
mentioning
this
case.
there
was
another
case
that
also
involved
and
came
up
at
the
same
time,
the
wright
case.
and
there
was
a
settlement
there
and
it
was
for
--
what
was
the
amount
of
money?
the
amount
of
damages
in
the
wright
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
was
there
something
in
the
evidence
there
that
made
it
proper
to
award
restitution
in
the
wright
case,
but
not
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
i
would
really
like
you
to
tell
us
concretely
what
the
government's
approach
would
be.
that
is,
we
have
all
is
one
position,
nothing
is
another
position,
and
the
middle.
the
government
comes
down
in
the
middle
and
what
i
gather
from
your
brief,
you
say
there
should
be
a
reasonable
formula
to
arrive
at
a
starting
point
for
further
analysis.
so,
i
don't
know
what
you
propose
as
a
starting
point.
what
is
a
reasonable
formula
that
the
court
should
use
for
its
starting
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
get
to
the
18,000?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
it
wouldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
wouldn't
include
the
people
who
are
not
prosecuted
and
it
wouldn't
include
the
people
who
in
the
future
are
prosecuted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
start
with
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
taking
into
account
that
the
perpetrator,
the
uncle,
that
the
restitution
was
something
like
$6,000;
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
there's
any
kind
of
proportionality,
it
seems
that
the
possessor
of
two
images
should
not
be
responsible
for
more
than
the
person
who
perpetrated
this
horrendous
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
like
you
to,
to
the
extent
that
you
can,
to
help
district
judges
get
a
handle
on
this.
what
formula
should
they
use
and
what
adjusting
factors
should
they
take
into
account
after
they
have
that
starting
formula?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
at
least
the
amount
of
the
judgments
she
has
already
received?
the
total
amount,
i
think,
was
3.4
million
that
you're
seeking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
has
so
far
collected
how
much?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
at
least
deduct
that
from
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
point
has
already
been
made
that
it
isn't
a
typical
joint
tortfeasor
situation
where
you
can
seek
contribution
from
people
who
equally
contributed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
--
how
would
the
defendant
here
go
about
seeking
contribution?
