mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
there
really
are
three
stark
choices
before
the
court
in
this
case.
paroline's
position
is
that,
because
of
a
proximate
causation
requirement,
amy
can
obtain
nothing
in
restitution.
amy's
position
is
that
because
multiple
people
have
contributed
to
her
single
loss,
she
can
obtain
the
full
restitution
for
all
of
her
losses
from
every
criminal
defendant.
the
government's
position
is
that
there
is
a
solution
that
tort
law
has
developed
for
providing
some
restitution
for
amy,
not
the
entire
restitution
that
would
be
owed
on
account
of
her
entire
loss.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
okay.
the
--
the
tort
law
issue
is
not
really
all
that
modern.
it
dates
back
to
the
restatement,
second,
of
torts
in
section
443(a).
and
this
court
applied
that
section
in
the
burlington
northern
case,
which
was
a
cercla
case,
to
hold
that
apportionment
of
the
damages
was
required
in
a
pollution
case
where
all
the
pollution
had
merged
into
a
single--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
the
key
to
reading
the
statutory
language
is
that
the
definition
of
"victim"
refers
to
a
victim
of
the
offense
in
this
case.
so
the
term
"victim"
means
the
individual
harmed
as
a
result
of
a
commission
of
a
crime
under
this
chapter.
the
government's
burden
of
proof
in
section
3664(e)
refers
to
demonstrating
the
amount
of
the
loss
sustained
by
a
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense.
so
it
refers
to
the
defendant's
offense,
not
to
the
collective
harm
that
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
hope
that
the
court
will
read
the
"as
a
result
of"
language
to
require
causation,
but
to
interpret
it
in
light
of
the
way
causation
has
been
understood
in
the
unique
circumstances
that
you
have
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there's
collective,
aggregate
but-for
cause.
and
the
way
that
tort
law
dealt
with
this
is
not
to
accept
paroline's
position
that,
even
if
it
--
you
took
me
out
of
the
equation,
amy's
harm
would
be
very
severe.
unquestionably
true.
what
tort
law
said
is
that
if
a
multiplicity
of
actors
inflict
a
single
harm
and
one
of
them
comes
forward
with
a
reason
that,
if
accepted,
would
exonerate
all
of
them,
then
that
cannot
be
a
proper
test
of
causation.
the
proper
test
is
aggregate
causation
where
the
aggregate
group
of
offenders
is
the
but-for
cause
and
each
one
of
the
individuals
in
that
set
can
be
regarded
as--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
allow
assessment
of
some
of
the
damages.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it
would
allow
assessment
of
the
entire
amount,
because,
again,
we
regard
this
--
this
statute
as
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
tort
law
principles
that
recognized
you
can
have
aggregate
causation,
but
it's
not
appropriate
to
hold
each
person
in
the
set
responsible
for
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
there's
a
specific
amount
of
harm
caused
and
if
amy
could
find
an
expert
who
would
testify
to
that
respect
and
it
would
require,
say,
six
counseling
sessions
and
it
would
set
her
back
in
employment
for
a
year,
then
i
guess
a
court
could,
if
it
found
that
credible,
conclude
that
a
certain
amount
of
loss
is
attributable
directly.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
the
government
reaches,
although
we
take
a
different
route
to
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--than
your
honor's
position.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
alito,
that
is
why
the
government
has
proposed
a
different
approach
to
getting
to
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
the
courts
have
approved
several
different
formulas
as
not
being
an
abuse
of
discretion.
one
camp
of
courts
approves
a
view
in
which
the
government
submits
the
number
of
people
who
have
been
ordered
to
pay
restitution
to
amy,
and
that
number
is
then
divided
into
the
total
harm,
measured
by
monetary
means,
that
amy
has
established.
and
that
provides
a
starting
point.
so,
for
example,
in
this
case,
that
starting
point
would
be
around
$18,000,
and
then
courts
can
adjust
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
by
considering
the
number
of
defendants
who
have
been
ordered
to
pay
restitution
to
amy,
because
that
provides
some
certainty
in
the
face
of,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
the
great
difficulty
in
determining
how
many
people
have
actually
viewed
these
pictures--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
number
of
people
who
have
been
ordered
to
pay
to
restitution
represents
a
judicial
finding
that,
in
fact,
her
picture
is
involved
in
that
person's
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct.
and
some
courts,
justice
ginsburg,
have
therefore
required
that
the
formula
be
adjusted
to
make
some
sort
of
reasonable
estimate
of
the
total
pool
of
violators.
and
so
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
doesn't
work
very
well
for
the
first
person,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
there
are
other
approaches
that
do
work.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
can
certainly
say
that
the
statute
requires
reasonable
apportionment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
the
districts
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
experiment
with
different
formulations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
could
recommend
a
--
an
approach.
what
the
sentencing
commission
actually
did
was
recommend
to
congress
that
it
fix
it
because
the
disagreements
now
pertain
to
the
understanding
of
the
statute.
our
submission
is
that
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
approach
this
problem.
none
is
perfect.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
alternative
that
i
would
propose
in
that
instance
is
to
look
at
other
similarly
situated
child
pornography
victims
and
take
a
look
at
what
district
courts
have
been
awarding
to
those
victims
in
similar
types
of
cases
and
provide
some
sort
of
an
average
range.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
hope
that
it's
not
quite
as
arbitrary
as
plucking
it
out
of
the
air,
but
the
reality
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--on
the
first
one
it's
impossible
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
are
using
some
theory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
sometimes
they
articulate
various
considerations
and
other
times
they
rely
on
basically
a
consensus,
a
judicial
consensus
that
in
a
world
in
which
perfect
information
and
mathematical
computations
are
not
going
to
happen,
a
reasonable
approximation
that
accords
with
the
judgments
of
200
other
federal
judges
is
a
sensible
way
to
do
this.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
would,
as
i
indicated,
start
with
a
--
a
division
problem
and
approximate
the
--
the
number
of
damages
that
are
allocable
to
that
individual
and
then
adjust
it
because
these
defendants
are
not
all
identical.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
necessarily,
because
as
i
indicated,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
defendants
aren't
all
identical.
mr.
paroline
possessed
two
images.
some
defendants
may
possess
a
hundred
images.
some
defendants
may
be
distributors
as
well
as
possessors,
and
courts
have
taken
those
factors
into
account.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
his
--
his
restitution
may
have
been
predicated
on
a
very
early
period
where
it
was
not
clear
that
amy
would
be
as
victimized
as
she
has
turned
out
to
be.
the
very
vice
of
child
pornography
possession
and
distribution
is
that
it
continually
re-inflicts
the
abuse
on
the
victim
so
that
she
cannot
make
a
fresh
start
and
say
it's
finally
over.
i've
put
this
behind
me.
i
can
now
move
on
with
my
life.
the
continuing
re-victimization
of
her
is
what
justifies
and
creates
the
increased
harms.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
the
formula
that
i
proposed
is
the
one
that
the
government
has
been
suggesting
to
district
courts
around
the
country.
look
at
the
number
of
convicted
defendants
who
have
been
ordered
to
pay
restitution
to
amy,
divide
that
into
the
total
harm
that
the
district
court
finds
was
the
result
of
the
community
of
child
pornography
possessors,
and
then
adjust
it
based
on
the
severity
of
the
offense.
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
other
formulations
are
also
not
abuses
of
the
district
court's
discretion,
and
i
would
emphasize--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
the
amount
of
money
that
amy
has
asked
for.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
criminal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--post
booker--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--post
booker,
that
is
what
happens
in
criminal
sentencing.
district
judges
have
an
enormous
amount
of
discretion
about
how
much
imprisonment
time
and
fine
time
to
use
to
apply
to
a
defendant.
and
there
is
appellate
review
that
helps
establish
some
norms
that
can
look
to
sentencing
guidelines
as
starting
points.
but
in
criminal
sentencing,
imprecision
and
estimation
is
the
order
of
the
day.
and
when
you're
dealing
with--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
there
are
two
background
principles
that
i
think
reinforce
that
a
reasonable
estimation
is
better
than
all
or
none.
the
first
background
principle
is
that
in
criminal
restitution,
exactitude
is
not
required.
reasonable
estimates
are
the
order
of
the
day.
courts
have
recognized
that.
and
it's
reinforced
here
by
the
fact
that
this
restitution
provision
is
kind
of
a
crime
tort
hybrid.
it's
criminal
sentencing,
but
it's
enacted
against
the
background
of
compensatory
tort
law.
and
in
compensatory
tort
law,
reasonable
estimates
have
long
been
accepted.
in
the
burlington
northern
case
that
i
referred
to
earlier,
the
district
court
made
an
effort
to
do
some
calculations
and
then
at
the
end,
he
applied
a
50
percent
fudge
factor
for
estimations
that
reflected
possible
calculation
errors.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
a
criminal
provision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
--
that
is
placed
into
criminal
sentencing
with
a
goal
of
both
compensating
victims
and
determining
that
each
defendant
comes
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
that
person
has
inflicted
some
harm
on
a
particular
victim.
that's
a
valuable
criminal
sentencing
purpose,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
only
thing
that
courts
can
do
in
this
situation
is
attempt
reasonable
approximations
that
will
not
be
exact,
it's
a
better
solution
than
saying
nothing,
as
paroline
would
do,
or
saying
amy
--
everything,
as
amy
would
do.
that
is
not
proportionate
to
what
the
defendant
has
done,
but
zero
is
also
grossly
disproportionate
to
what
the
defendant
has
done.
thank
you.
