justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
--
before
you
do
that,
could
you
explain
why
there
is
an
issue
of
proximate
causation
here?
why
--
why
isn't
there
clearly
proximate
cause?
why
is
it
--
why
does
it
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
but
why
--
why
isn't
the
issue
here
a
question
of
factual
causation?
what
losses
proximately
caused
--
is
proximately
caused
by
the
possession
of
child
pornography?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
answer
is
in
a
large
category
of
cases,
and
this
may
be
--
these
may
be
the
typical
cases,
where
there's
a
digital
image
and
it's
out
there
and
you
don't
even
know
that
there
are
a
thousand
people
who've
seen
it.
it's
impossible
to
tell
how
many
people
have
seen
it
and
certainly
impossible
to
see
how
many
people
will
see
it
in
the
future.
it
--
it
exists
and
it
apparently
is
impossible
to
eradicate
it.
your
answer
is
that
in
those
cases,
the
victim
gets
nothing.
i
mean,
that's
your
honest
answer.
and
that
may
be
where
the
statute
points,
but
i
think
that's
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question:
the
victim
gets
nothing
in
those
cases
because
it's
impossible
to
determine
what
percentage
of
the
harm
is
attributable
to
this
one
defendant's
possession
of
the
child
pornography.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
is
it
consistent
with
human
psychology?
are
psychologists
really
able
to
do
this?
if
it's
known
that
this
image
has
been
viewed
by
--
even
if
you
could
figure
out
how
many
people
have
viewed
it,
and
i
think
in
the
age
of
the
internet
that's
impossible,
but
if
you
knew
that
it
had
been
viewed
by
a
thousand
people,
is
a
psychologist
able
to
say
that
her
knowledge
that
it
has
been
viewed
by
a
thousand
people
causes
this
much
harm?
and
once
she
learns
that
it's
now
been
viewed
by
a
thousand
and
one
people,
there's
a
little
bit
of
additional
harm
or
some
increment
of
additional
harm
and
we
can
figure
out
how
much
that
is.
can
a
psychologist
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
this--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
--
mr.
cassell,
let
me
give
you
this
example.
there
are
pictures
like
this
and
it's
known
that
they
are
out
on
the
internet,
so
therefore
they
are
probably
always
going
to
be
available
and
who
knows
how
many
people
are
going
to
view
it.
and
so
the
first
person
is
caught
for
possession
of
some
of
these
pictures
and
is
convicted
and
the
psychologist
testifies
that,
you
know,
my
client
--
that
the
victim
in
this
case
knows
that
these
things
are
out
there
and
there's
an
unknown
--
an
unknown
quantity
of
people
are
going
to
view
it
and
my
estimate
is
that
the
--
the
treatment
she
is
going
to
need
for
this
is
going
to
be
$5
million.
all
right.
or
$3
million,
whatever
it
is.
now,
the
first
person
is
convicted,
so
the
first
person
is
assessed
restitution
in
the
amount
of
$3
million,
right?
but
then
shortly
after
that
ten
more
people
are
convicted
for
possessing
the
same
amount.
they
all
pay
nothing
because
the
first
person
paid
everything?
that's
your
answer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
my
example,
suppose
that
the
first
person,
who
has
a
restitution
order
for
the
full
amount,
seems
unlikely
ever
to
be
able
to
pay
that.
does
that
mean
that
they
--
you
would
impose
the
same
--
keep
imposing
the
same
judgment
on
everybody
else,
so
everybody
would
be
hit
with
$3
million?
