it
seems
you're
confusing
proximate
cause
with
cause
in
fact.
they
are
two
legal
requirements
but
not
the
same.
proximate
cause
is
foreseeability.
there's
no
argument,
i
think,
that
anyone
who
possesses
child
pornography
knows
that
the
individual
depicted
is
going
to
feel
invaded
by
that
viewing.
so
there's
no
issue
that
the
person
is
hurt.
the
question
is
a
different
one,
which
is
the
cause
in
fact.
i
think
that's
what
my
colleague
sam
alito
was
talking
about.
so
why
do
you
continue
to
talk
about
proximate
cause
when
it's
a
different
concept
that's
at
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
her
treatment
--
i
think
you're
arguing
that
her
treatment
has
to
be
a
"but
for"
this
possession.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
exactly
--
give
me
an
example
of
what
you're
talking
about.
now,
here
you're
saying
because
she
didn't
know
the
name
of
your
defendant,
you
win
because
you
can't
say
any
harm
was
caused
by
him
because
she
didn't
know
his
name,
correct?
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
give
me
an
example
of
how
the
government
can
--
the
hypothetical
that
justice
alito
spoke
about
and
justice
kagan,
you've
got
--
or
--
or
justice
breyer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
how
do
you
square
your
position
with
the
statutory
language?
the
statutory
language
requires
mandatory
restitution
order
for
the,
quote,
"full
amount
of
the
victim's
losses.
"
it
also
forbids
courts
to
--
to
decline
to
issue
an
order,
double
negative,
but
it
can't
--
a
court
can't
refuse
to
issue
an
order
on
the
ground
that
the
victim
has
been
compensated
by
any
other
source.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
language,
as
crazy
as
it
seems
to
you
or
--
to
you,
compels
joint
and
several
liability,
because
it's
saying
any
--
all
losses,
full
amount
of
losses,
and
you
can't
offset
her
compensation
from
any
other
sources.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
that
a
but-for
cause?
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
argue
that,
you
have
to
be
arguing
but-for--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
their
damages
have
to
be
the
but-for
cause.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
aren't
those
all
if
we
don't
buy
your
argument,
if
we
read
into
(f)
proximate
causation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
are
you
wasting
time
on
the
argument
if
you
win
either
way?
tell
us
without
it.
