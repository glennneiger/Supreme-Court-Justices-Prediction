had
nothing
to
do
with
an
antidiscrimination
law.
it
had
to
do
with
a
remedy,
defective
segregation.
why
isn't
this
identical
to
seattle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
that
the
proponents
of
affirmative
action
are
attempting
to
do
the
same
thing?
one
of
the
bill
sponsors
here
said
that
this
constitutional
amendment
will
bring
back
desegregation
in
michigan,
and
it
appears
to
have
done
just
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
that
in
grutter,
all
of
the
social
scientists
had
pointed
out
to
the
fact
that
all
of
those
efforts
had
failed.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
--
i
think
it
was
a
law
school
claim
in
michigan
was
upheld.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
always
wonderful
for
minorities
that
they
finally
get
in,
they
finally
have
children
and
now
you're
going
to
do
away
for
that
preference
for
them.
it
seems
that
the
game
posts
keeps
changing
every
few
years
for
minorities.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
see
the
distinction.
bussing
could
be
viewed,
and
was
viewed,
to
benefit
only
one
group.
it
was
a
preference
for
blacks
to
get
into
better
schools.
that's
the
way
the
case
was
pitched,
that
was
its
justification,
and
to
integrate
the
society.
affirmative
action
has
the
same
gain.
we've
said
that
in
fisher;
it
should
be
to
diversify
the
population,
so
it
favors
diversity
as
opposed
to
desegregation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
don't
see
how
the
argument
would
be
any
different
here.
one
of
the
main
sponsors
of
this
bill
said
it
was
intended
to
segregate
again.
the
voters
in
seattle
were
not
all
filled
with
animus;
some
of
them
just
cared
about
their
children
not
leaving
--
not
having
outsiders
come
in.
i
mean,
there's
always
voters
who
have
good
intent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
seattle
as
well.
so
it
wasn't
the
issue
of
animus
that
drove
seattle.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
we
do
with
the
statistics
from
california?
an
amici
from
california,
their
attorney
general,
has
shown,
another
state
with
a
similar
proposition,
has
shown
the
dramatic
drop.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
it
okay
to
have
taken
away
--
not
okay
to
have
taken
away
the
decision
to
have
bussing
from
the
local
school
boards,
the
people
on
the
ground,
but
it's
okay
to
take
that
power
away
from
the
people
on
the
ground
here,
the
board
of
regents,
who
are
also
elected
like
the
school
board
was
in
seattle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
general
population
has
feelings
about
many
things,
but
the
only
decision
that
they're
--
educational
decision
that
they
are
taking
away
from
the
board
of
regents
is
this
one:
affirmative
action.
everything
else
they
leave
within
the
elected
board
of
regents.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you've
done
something
much
more.
you
are
basically
saying,
because
fisher
and
grutter
--
we've
always
applied
strict
scrutiny--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
so
it's
essentially
a
last
resort,
within
some
reason.
but
what
you
are
saying,
if
all
those
other
measures
fail,
you're
by
constitution
saying
you
can't
go
to
the
remedy
that
might
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
you're
--
but
this
amendment
is
stopping
the
political
process.
it's
saying
the
board
of
regents
can
do
everything
else
in
the
field
of
education
except
this
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
can't
be
that,
because
the
normal
political
process
imposes
burdens
on
different
groups.
i
thought
the
line
was
a
very
simple
one,
which
is
if
the
normal
academic
decision-making
is
in
the
dean,
the
faculty,
at
whatever
level,
as
long
as
the
normal
right
to
control
is
being
exercised,
then
that
person
could
change
the
decision.
so
if
they
delegate
most
admissions
decisions,
as
i
understand
from
the
record,
to
the
faculty,
but
they
still
regularly,
besides
race,
veto
some
of
those
decisions,
and
race
is
now
one
of
them,
then
the
board
of
regents
can
do
that
normally.
so
could
the
president,
if
that's
the
way
it's
normally
done.
it's
when
the
process
is
--
political
process
has
changed
specifically
and
only
for
race,
as
a
constitutional
amendment
here
was
intended
to
do,
that
the
political
doctrine
is
violated.
have
i
restated?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
diversity
does,
but
when
you
take
away
a
tool
for
diversity
that's
what
seattle
is
saying
is
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can't
take
the
tool
away
simply
because
it
may
include
race
as
a
factor,
simply
because
you
are
changing
the
playing
field.
