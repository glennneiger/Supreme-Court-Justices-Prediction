justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
people
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
plus
and
the
minus.
some
judges
differ
on
that
point.
some
agree
sort
of
with
you,
and
some
agree
sort
of
not.
all
right?
let's
think
of
those
who
agree
sort
of,
and
then
i
have
a
question.
and
you
know
this
area
better
than
i.
so
think
of
grutter.
grutter
permits
affirmative
action.
think
of
the
earlier
cases.
they
permitted
affirmative
action
where
it
was
overcome,
the
effects
of
past
discrimination,
but
probably
not
otherwise.
now,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
are
there
areas
other
than
education
where
affirmative
action
would
not
be
forbidden
to
achieve
a
goal
other
than
overcoming
the
effects?
have
you
got
the
question?
and
does
an
answer
come
to
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
there
are
a
set.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
there
are
a
set,
what
i
--
what
i'd
like
you
to
explain,
if
--
if
you
can
take
a
minute,
is
think
of
how
a
city
is
set
up.
there
are
a
vast
number
of
administrators.
there
are
a
vast
number
of
programs.
it
could
be
an
administrator
somewhere
says
he'd
like
to
give
a
preference,
maybe
for
good
reason.
but
then
the
city
council
votes
no,
because
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it,
by,
you
know,
first
come,
first
served
or
some
other
criteria
that
doesn't
use
race.
are
all
of
those
unlawful?
every
one?
do
you
have
to
leave
it
up
to
the
--
no
matter
what
the
subject,
no
matter
what
the
--
or
are
you
going
to
draw
a
line
somewhere?
is
there
a
line
that
you
could
draw
that
would
take
your
case
on
the
right
side
from
your
point
of
view,
but
would
say
we're
not
giving
power
to
every
administrator
in
the
city
to
decide
on
his
own
whether
to
use
racial
preferences
without
a
possibility
of
a
higher-up
veto--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
don't
think
you
want
to
say,
but
maybe
you
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
line?
is
there
any
line
that
you
can
say,
look
here.
we
were
trying
to
be
very
helpful,
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
put
this
thing
on
the
ballot,
you
can't
even
get
it
through.
okay?
that's
your
basic
point.
but
--
but
if
you
think
of
--
you
have
to
write
something,
and
that
something
has
tremendous
effect
all
over
the
place.
so
what
kind
of
line
is
there,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
instead
of
political
process.
don't
let
me
put
words
in
your
mouth.
think
what
you
think
here.
you
say
where
the
authority
is
divided
in
a
certain
way,
and
that
is
true
under
the
constitution
of
the
state.
so
the
state
government
lacks
the
power.
and
then
you
have
to
take
the
power
from
the
people
and
change
the
constitution,
and
when
you
do
that
in
respect
to
a
benefit,
then,
in
respect
to
benefits,
washington
--
you
know,
seattle
and
hunter
kick
in.
see,
where
are
not
dealing
with
past
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
benefit
to
a
minority
group.
but
what
i'm
thinking
is
go
read
the
cases.
you
yourself
seem
to
say
these
cases
seem
to
apply
alike
to
the
benefits
or
to
the
discrimination
against
it.
i
mean,
there
is
lots
of
language
in
seattle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
come
--
now,
suppose
you
take
that
and
say,
all
right,
it
was
meant
in
context;
but
the
context
includes
constitutional
amendments
because
with
the
constitutional
amendment
you
are
restructuring.
now
you
would
lose
on
that
theory;
but
there
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
extent
to
which
the
people
have
the
right
to
move
powers
around.
