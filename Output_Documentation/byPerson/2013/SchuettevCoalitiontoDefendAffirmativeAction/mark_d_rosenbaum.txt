mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin,
justice
kennedy,
with
the
questions
you
raise
and
then
come
to
the
question
that
chief
justice
roberts
raised.
to
begin,
justice
kennedy,
there's
no
way
to
distinguish
the
seattle
case
from
this
case
nor
the
hunter
case.
both
those
cases
have
to
be
overruled.
here
is
why
the
seattle
case
is
--
is
identical
to
this
case.
both
issues
--
both
cases
involve
constitutionally
permissible
plans
which
had
as
their
objective
obtaining
diversity
on
campuses.
seattle
was
a
k
through
12
case.
this
case
is
a
higher
education
case.
but
in
both
instances,
the
objective
was
to
obtain
diversity.
no
constitutional
mandate
to
relieve
past
discrimination.
rather,
in
fact,
as
the
court
said,
seattle,
tacoma,
and
wasco
were
attempting
to
deal
with
de
facto
segregation.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct
with
respect
to
at
least
one
of
the
districts,
justice
alito.
but
in
terms
of
the
program
itself,
there's
no
dispute
that
it
was
done
pursuant
to
a
plan
for
de
facto
segregation.
moreover,
the
question
you
asked,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
but
there'd
been
no
finding,
justice
alito,
of
de
jure
segregation.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
there
was
--
there
was
no
finding
whatsoever
that
there
had
been
de
jure
segregation
and
that
there
was
a
constitutional
imperative
to
correct
that
desegregation.
it
was
an
absolutely
identical
situation.
and
regarding
the
accountability,
your
honor
is
correct
that
in
seattle
what
we
were
dealing
with
was
an
elected
school
board
and
here,
as
the
michigan
brief
says,
as
the
wayne
state
brief
says,
as
the
court
specifically
found
at
pages
326a
and
327a
of
the
record,
this
is
a
political
process
in
which
the
regents
were
elected,
have
at
all
times
maintained
plenary
authority
over
the
admissions
process
itself,
and
that--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that
--
that
--
that
is
no
question
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
--
the
ordinary
process
itself
is
a
politically
accountable
process.
that's
what
the
district
court
found
when
it
looked
at
how
the
system
worked.
and
in
fact--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
couldn't
alter
--
i'm
sorry,
chief
roberts.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
absolutely
fine.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
because
the
difference
is
that
in
the
seattle
case,
in
this
case,
and
in
the
hunter
case,
what's
going
on
is
a
change
from
the
ordinary
political
process,
which
your
honor
perfectly
described.
they
can
change
it
today.
they
can
go
to
a
--
an
affirmative
action
plan
today,
repeal
it
tomorrow,
come
back.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
is
different,
your
honor,
because
of
the
racial
nature
of
the
decision.
under
their
theory,
under
their
theory,
the
people
of
the
state
--
of
a
state
could
amend
their
constitution,
put
in
the
legislature
two
rooms,
one
for
racial
matters,
one
for
all
other
sorts
of
matters,
and
say
to
any
entrant
who
wants
to
enter
that
first
room:
you
may
do
so,
but
first
you
have
to
pay
an
exorbitant
cover
charge
and
then
you
have
to
mount
multiple
stairs,
flights
of
stairs,
just
to
begin
the
process
of
enacting
constitutionally
permissible
legislation.
or
think
about
it
in
a
desegregation
case.
a
student
comes
in
--
two
students
come
into
the
admissions
committee.
one
says
--
and
the
admissions
committee
says:
we
have
one
question
for
you,
one
question
for
you
since
you're
here
to
talk
about
a
legitimate
--
a
legitimate
factor
in
pursuit
of
diversity.
here's
the
question:
do
you
want
to
talk
about
your
race,
your
race
in
the
context
of
other
factors?
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
that
student
is
shown
the
door,
told
go
raise
between
5
and
$15
million,
repeal
prop
2
and
then
you
can
come
back
to
make
--
make
the
case.
whereas
the
student
who
says,
no,
i've
just
got
another
legitimate
factor,
maybe
geography.
maybe
alumni
confections
--
connections,
whatever
that
is,
that
person
is
permitted
to
make
the
case.
it
is
a
racial
distinction.
now,
chief
justice
roberts,
you're
certainly
onto
something
in
terms
of
are
there
race-neutral
methods
to
get
this
done?
of
course
there
are.
the
state
constitution
itself
could
be
altered
so
that
a
different
committee
or
a
different
set
of
individuals
could
--
could
make
the
decision
that
they
don't
like
the
way
the
regents
are
doing
it.
or
they
could
do
it
the
old-fashioned
way,
the
way
that
the
politically
accountable
system
works,
which
is
to
say,
we
are
going
to
work
at
these
universities,
that's
how
affirmative
action
involving
race
happened
in
the
first
place.
that's
at
pages
270
to
271a
and
282a
to
293a.
they
worked
for
years
to
make
that
happen.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
exactly.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
state
can
say,
we
don't
want
to
hear
that
whether
it
comes
from
a
white
person
or
a
black
person
or
whomever,
if
in
fact,
they
are
not
doing
it
on
a
race-specific
basis.
you're
exactly
right,
of
course,
about
strict
scrutiny.
and
the
programs
in
this
case,
indeed,
the
only
programs
in
this
case
that
are
effective,
are
those
that
have
passed
strict
scrutiny--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--you
do,
your
honor,
when
the
program
has
passed
the
strict
scrutiny
test
that
we're
talking
about.
and
that's
the
only
sort
of
program
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
of
course
you're
correct.
if
it
is
a
gratz
type
program,
if
it's
unconstitutional,
if
it's
a
quota
system,
you
don't
have
to
listen
to
anybody
talk
about
race.
but
we
are
only
dealing
with
constitutionally
permissible
programs.
why
it
is
impossible,
impossible
to
distinguish
seattle?
and
this
argument
about
hunter,
page
--
page
389
of
the
hunter
decision
is
the
reason
hunter
was
decided.
it's
not
a
washington
v.
davis
case.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
assuming
that
the
regents
say
that's
fine,
no
problem
whatsoever,
no
problem
whatsoever.
that's
the
ordinary
political
process.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
regents
have
plenary--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--not
under
the
michigan
constitution,
because
the
michigan
constitution--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--okay.
under
--
who's
got
the
authority
here?
the
--
the
legislature
can
take
it
away.
that's
not
a
problem
in
a
--
in
a
situation
where
that's
part
of
the
ordinary
process.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
where
there
is--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--my
apologies,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
both
are
music
to
my
ears.
the
point,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
--
the
people
of
the
state
have
multiple
options
available
to
them
if
they
don't
like
the
way
the
universities
are
operating.
but
the
one
option
they
don't
have
is
to
treat
racial
matters
different
from
all
other
matters.
the
example
that
you
gave--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--exactly.
and
the
problem
--
the
problem
that
the
restructuring
process
gets
at,
because
of
the
particular
concern
that
this
court
has
shown
with
respect
to
the
political
process,
that
the
political
process
itself
not
become
outcome
determinative;
that
the
political
process
itself
be
a
place
where
we
can
air
these
discussions,
but
not
create
it
in
a
separate
and
unequal
way
to
make
the
--
to
actually
make
the
decision
itself
through
the
process.
so--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--then
i'm
not
explaining
it
clearly.
the
first
--
the
--
when
the
faculty
makes
the
decision,
justice
kennedy,
that's
part
of
the
ordinary
political
process.
nobody's
allowed
to
win
all
the
time.
no
one
has
to
win
all
the
time.
whatever
it
is,
it
is.
that's
the
ordinary
political
process.
that's
how
we
use
the
political
process.
the
problem
with
--
with
mounting
a
racial
classification
within
the
constitution
itself
is
that
then
--
that
takes
the
ordinary
political
process
to
the
extraordinary
political
process.
that's--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
problem,
your
honor,
as
this
court
stated
as
recently
as
last
term
in
the
fisher
case,
is
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
race
is
not
all
the
way
off
the
table.
and
the
problem
with
proposal
2
is
that
the
substance
and
the
message
that
it
communicates
is
that
because
of
the
separate
and
unequal
political
track
that
is
created
with
respect
to
the
extraordinary
steps
that
have
to
be
taken,
the
message
is
that,
even
where
race
is
being
utilized
as
one
of
many
factors
in
a
constitutionally
permissible
way,
the
message
that
is
being
communicated
is
that
all
uses
of
race
are
illegitimate,
all
uses
of
race
are
--
are
off
the
table,
that
“
race
”
itself
is
a
dirty
word.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
the
underlying
basis
of
the
entire
strict
scrutiny
doctrine
in
the
14th
amendment
is
to
preclude
the
government,
preclude
the
legislative
and
executive
branch,
from
making
those
determinations
as
absolute
determinations.
the
14th
amendment
sets
the
standards
and
the
criteria
by
which
we
measure
that.
of
course
you're
correct.
that's
what
the
14th
amendment
does.
it
sets
what
the
rules
are
in
terms
of
how
race
is
utilized.
but
what
the
grutter
case
said--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
you
have
to
use
the
ordinary
political
process.
and
that's
all
we're
saying.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
but
the
--
but
the
fact
that
it's
a
state
constitutional
amendment
underscores
my
argument,
which
is
that
--
that
in
order
for
the
--
for
a
--
the
minority
or
any
individual,
and
white,
minority,
whatever
--
whatever
the
individual
is,
to
say
i
want
the
same
rule
book,
i
want
the
same
playing
field,
the
problem
with
proposal
2
is
that
it
creates
two
playing
fields.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
would,
your
honor,
because
--
because
it
would
be
building
in
this
explicitly
facial
racial
classification
into
the
state
constitution.
the
problem
are
the
separate
and
unequal
systems
that
are
being
used
to
deal
with
race.
and
separate
and
unequal,
under
the
14th
amendment,
shouldn't
come
within
ten
feet
of
race.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
is
a
racial--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
your
honor.
the
problem
with
proposal
2
is
that
it
is
--
just
as
in
hunter,
just
as
in
hunter
--
it
is
an
explicitly
facial
racial
classification.
it
singles
out
race
for
different
treatment.
my
goodness,
this
was
borne
--
this
campaign
started
three
days
after
grutter
itself.
the
author
said
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
get
rid
of
racial
preferences.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
well,
it
sets
the
standard--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
i'm
measuring
it
as
a
racial
classification
by
the
14th
amendment.
and
that
comes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
argument.
his
argument,
his
revisionist
history
of
hunter,
his
--
was
--
was
about
motive.
but,
your
honor,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
in
this
case.
when
the
court
looked
--
when
the
district
court
looked
--
may
i
finish
my
answer,
chief
justice
roberts?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
when
the
court
looked
at
this
particular
issue,
the
concern
was
the
way
that
it
racially
divided
the
political
process
itself.
what
he
is
saying
is
that,
well,
there
may
be
all
sorts
of
motives.
that's
a
rational
basis
test,
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
racial
classification.
the
definition
i'm
using,
justice
scalia,
is
this
court's
definition
of
a
racial
classification,
for
which
all
sorts
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
thank
you
very
much.
