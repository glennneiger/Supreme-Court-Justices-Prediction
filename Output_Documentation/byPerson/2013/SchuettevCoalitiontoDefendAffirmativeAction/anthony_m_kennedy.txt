justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
while
you're
on
seattle,
can
you
--
i
have
difficulty
distinguishing
seattle.
one
factual
difference
is
that
there
was
a
school
board
there,
a
directly-elected
school
board
elected
for
a
short
term
of
years.
here
there's
a
board
of
trustees.
is
that
--
is
that
the
distinguish
--
a
distinguishing
factor
in
the
case
in
which
a
principal
distinction
could
be
made?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
saying
there
--
there
are
three
things.
one,
the
first
you
reject.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
law
was
a
racial
focus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
and
the
second
was
an
incremental
improvement
in
the
--
in
the
democratic
process
--
or
democratic
responsibility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
responsiveness,
i
guess.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
was
there
a
third,
did
you
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that,
it
seemed
to
me
a
good
distinction
for
hunter
and
mulkey
v.
reitman,
which
the
briefs
don't
talk
much
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
necessarily
a
distinction
in
seattle
because
seattle
you
could
argue,
well,
there
are
other
methods
that
are
less
racially
divisive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
do
with
a
constitutional
amendment
that
said
pro-affirmative
action
laws,
and
only
those,
require
a
three-quarters
vote
of
the
state
legislature?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
are
two
things.
number
one
is
it
delegated
to
the
faculty.
and
number
two,
they're
election
--
they're
elected
only
rarely
and
in
staggered
terms.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
suppose
the
board
of
regents
have
a
rule,
it's
written,
it's
a
rule,
that
the
faculty
makes
a
determination
on
whether
there
should
be
affirmative
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
five
--
and
the
faculty
votes
for
affirmative
action.
three
years
later,
the
board
of
trustees
said
we're
abolishing
the
rule;
we're
doing
that
ourselves.
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
--
so
the
regents
can
take
it
away
from
the
faculty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
the
legislature
take
it
away
from
the
regents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
hypothetical
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
the
voters
can't
take
it
away.
at
what
point
is
it
that
your
objection
takes
force?
i
just
don't
understand
--
i
just
don't
understand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
declension
here--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
the
crescendo,
whatever
you
call
it.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
applies
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
or
my
revision
of
it
as
between
the
board
of
regents
and
the
faculty
or
between
the
faculty
and
the
legislature.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
--
why
is
the
faculty
administration,
a
faculty
decision,
any
less
outcome
determinative
than
what
the
voters
would
say?
i
--
i
think
there
would
be
people
that
might
disagree
with
your
empirical
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
question.
suppose
the
dean
has
authority
in
the
bylaws
of
the
university
to
reverse
what
the
faculty
does,
but
you
have
a
dean
who
just
does
not
like
affirmative
action.
he
is
dead
against
it.
and
he
makes
the
decision
to
reverse
the
faculty.
do
you
have
a
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
you
have
justice
alito's
question.
then
it's
the
president
of
the
university,
and
then
it's
the
legislature.
