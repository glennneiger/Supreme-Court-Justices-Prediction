mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
michigan
constitutional
provision
requiring
equal
treatment
violates
equal
protection.
and
for
two
reasons,
the
answer
is
no.
first,
unlike
the
laws
at
issue
in
hunter
and
seattle,
section
26
does
not
repeal
an
antidiscrimination
law.
instead,
it
repeals
preferences
and
thus,
it's
an
impediment
to
preferential
treatment,
not
equal
treatment.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
sotomayor,
it's
not
identical
because
of
the
remedy
issue.
in
seattle,
they
were
trying
to
create,
in
the
court's
words,
equal
educational
opportunity
by
imposing
a
remedy
that
would
result
in
equality
in
the
schools.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
there's
two
points
to
that
question
and
i'll
address
them
both.
first
on
the
merits,
under
grutter,
the
point
of
preferences
in
university
admissions
cannot
be
solely
the
benefit
of
the
minority,
because
under
grutter,
it's
supposed
to
benefit
the
campus
as
a
whole
through
diversity,
and
which
we
think
is
a
laudable
goal.
it's
a
forward-looking
action,
not
a
backward-looking
action,
to
remedy
past
discrimination.
and
we
know
that
because
under
grutter,
you
can
use
preferences
whether
or
not
there's
de
facto
or
de
jure
segregation,
simply
to
get
the
benefit.
but
with
respect
to
your
--
your
point
about
the
university
of
michigan
and
what
has
or
has
not
happened
here,
two
thoughts
on
that.
first,
we
have
the
statistics
that
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief
where
it's
not
clear
that
--
that
the
diversity
on
michigan's
campus
has
gone
down.
but
our
main
point
on
that
is
--
is
not
those
numbers,
but
the
fact
that
there
are
other
things
that
the
university
of
michigan
could
be
doing
to
achieve
diversity
in
race-neutral
ways.
for
example,
we
know
that--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
there's
social
science
evidence
that
goes
both
ways.
but
i
want
to
focus
on
the
university
of
michigan
because
there's
two
things
that
they
could
be
doing
right
now
that
would
get
them
closer
to
the
race-neutral
goal.
the
first
thing
is
that
they
could
eliminate
alumnae
preferences.
other
schools
have
done
that.
they
have
not.
that's
certainly
one
way
that
tilts
the
playing
field
away
from
underrepresented
minorities.
the
other
one,
and
this
is
really
important,
is
the
focus
on
socioeconomic--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--given
the
makeup
of
michigan's
alumnae
right
now,
certainly
that
playing
field
would
be
tilted
the
other
way.
the
other
thing
that
we
practice
is
socioeconomic
diversity.
and
at
the
university
of
michigan,
there
was
a
stat
in
“
the
wall
street
journal
”
just
two
days
ago
that
if
you
measure
that
by
pell
grants,
the
number
of
students
who
are
eligible
for
those,
at
the
university,
the
number
of
students
who
have
pell
grants
is
half
what
it
is
at
more
progressive
institutions
like
berkeley
and
the
university
of
texas
at
austin.
so
the
university
of
michigan
could
be
trying
harder.
but
our
point
isn't
to
get
into
a
debate
about
whether
preferences
are
a
good
or
bad
thing,
because
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
the
question
is
whether
the
people
of
michigan
have
the
choice
through
the
democratic
process
to
accept
this
court's
invitation
in
grutter
to
try
race-neutral
means.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
it's
a
distinguishing
factor.
you
know,
kind
of
sticking
with
how
hard
is
it
under
the
new
political
process.
and
i
think
the
chart
that
we
have
on
page
17
of
our
reply
brief
explains
that
it's
really
easier
to
change
race-based
admissions
policies
now
than
it
was
before
section
26.
and
that's
one
basis.
but
i
think
the
more
fundamental
basis
is
to
say,
you
know,
what
seattle
is
about.
and
--
and
if
you
indulge
me,
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
seattle
could
mean
one
of
three
things.
one
of
those
i
think
you
should
clearly
reject,
and
then
the
other
two
i
think
are
--
are
possible
interpretations
that
you
could
adopt.
when
seattle
talks
about
racial
classifications,
it
focuses
on
laws
that
have
a
racial
focus.
now,
right
out
of
the
box,
equal
protection
is
about
people,
not
about
laws,
but
even
more
fundamentally,
that
cannot
be
the
right
test.
at
a
minimum,
that
part
of
seattle
has
to
go
because
if
you
had
a
race-neutral
law,
like
michigan's
equal
protection
clause,
which
forbids
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex
--
you
know,
it
mirrors
the
concept
of
the
federal
clause
--
that
itself
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
because
it
has
a
racial
focus.
so
we
know
that
can't
be
right
and
that's
respondent's
position.
so
that
leaves
you
two
other
choices.
and
one
would
be
an
incremental
change
to
this
political
restructuring
doctrine;
the
other
would
be
a
more
aggressive
change.
the
incremental
change
would
be
to
interpret
racial
classification
in
seattle
as
meaning
a
law
that,
one,
repeals
an
antidiscrimination
provision,
as
it
did
in
hunter
and
seattle;
and
two,
removes
that
issue
to
a
higher
level
of
the
decision-making
process.
and
because
michigan's
law
requires
equal
treatment,
it
eliminates
preferences,
not
an
antidiscrimination
law.
that
would
be
a
way
that
you
could
keep
seattle
and
hunter
as
a
viable
doctrine,
and
still
rule
in
our
favor
on
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
but
there's
a
difference
between
favoring
diversity
as
an
abstract
concept
on
campus,
which
grutter
clearly
allows,
and
remedying
past
discrimination,
which
was
the
point
of
the
bussing
in
seattle.
and
that's
why
we're
really
in
a
post-seattle
world
now,
because
under--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--that's
correct
because,
at
the
time
of
seattle's
decision,
we
didn't
yet
have
parents
involved,
and
so
there
wasn't
a
strict
scrutiny
test
that
was
being
applied
to
that
bussing
program.
and
so
you
didn't
have
to
go
as
far
as
you
would
today
if
you
wanted
to
uphold
that
same
bussing
program.
but
what
really
--
what
ties
this
case
up--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it
can't
be
because
of
racial
focus.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that,
plus--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
that,
plus
repealing
an
antidiscrimination
law.
i
think
that's
a
narrow
way--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
the
third
way
is
really
to
--
to
look
at
racial
focus
and
say
that's
wrong,
and
maybe
this
whole
doctrine
needs
to
be
reexamined.
and
the
way
that
you
could
do
that
is
to
look
at
what
seattle
and
hunter
are
really
doing,
which
is
falling
right
into
the
washington
v.
davis
line
of
cases.
both
of
those
cases
could
have
been
resolved
by
saying,
one,
there's
a
disparate
impact;
and
two,
given
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
1969,
akron,
ohio
and
1982,
seattle,
washington,
that
there
was
discriminatory
animus
based
on
race.
and
if
you
did
that,
you
could
reconcile
those
cases
with
washington
v.
davis
and
the
entire
line
of
equal
protection
jurisprudence
this
court
has
used
since
that
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
there
was
a
claim,
but,
your
honor,
there
was
also
a
decision.
and
the
district
court
was
really
clear
on
this.
keep
in
mind
that
this
was
a
summary
judgment
posture,
and
the
district
court
concluded
properly
that
there
wasn't
even
a
question
of
material
disputed
fact
with
respect
to
intent.
this
is
at
pages
317
to
319
of
the
supplemental
appendix
petition.
and
that's
because
the
primary
motivation
for
section
26
included
so
many
nondiscriminatory
reasons,
including
the
belief
of
some
in
michigan
that
preferences
are
themselves
race
discrimination.
others
that
--
race-neutral
alternatives
is
actually
a
better
way
to
achieve
campus
diversity
that
results
in
better
outcomes
for
underrepresented
minority
students.
some
could
believe
that
the
preferences
result
in
mismatch,
as
justice
thomas
is--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
and
i
think
--
and
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
reitman
because
that
fits
into
this
framework,
too.
but
i
think
if
you
have
any
question
about
what
seattle
really
meant,
the
place
to
look
is
the
later
decision
in
cuyahoga
falls,
because
in
cuyahoga
the
court
specifically
mentions,
quote,
"the
evil
of
discriminatory
intent
present
in
seattle.
"
that's
at
pages
196
to
'97
of
the
opinion.
and
it
also
talks
about
the
decisionmakers'
statements
as
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
in
the
hunter
case,
at
page
195.
and
so
i
think
if
you
look
at
cuyahoga
falls,
it
has
already
done
some
of
the
work
for
you
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
more
conservative
route
and
say
there's
intent.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
true
and
there
is
always
some
bad
apples,
too.
we
don't
dispute
that
point.
but
--
but
here
you
have
a
district
court
holding
that
there
is
not
even
a
material
question
of
fact
with
respect
to
animus,
because
there
are
so
many
reasons
that
could
be
advanced,
legitimate
reasons
again,
about
mismatch
and
about
the
benefits
of
racial--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
think
it's
much
harder
in
seattle,
your
honor.
but
to
fit
reitman
into
this
discussion
and
what
i
would
consider
the
more
conservative
way
to
deal
with
seattle
and
hunter,
one
that
would
preserve
those
as
a
doctrine,
is
to
think
about
how
reitman
would
come
out
under
that
test.
in
reitman,
of
course,
you
had
antidiscrimination
laws
just
like
in
hunter
at
the
local
level,
which
were
then
repealed
by
a
state
constitutional
amendment.
and
the
political
restructuring
doctrine
had
not
yet
been
invented
yet,
and
so
what
the
court
did
is
it
relied
on
the
california
supreme
court's
finding
that
there
was
discriminatory
animus
in
striking
down
those
antidiscrimination
laws.
i
think
that
if
you
view
hunter
and
seattle
similarly
as
cases
where
if
you
repeal
an
antidiscrimination
law,
as
opposed
to
one
that
requires
equal
treatment,
that's
the
narrow
way
to
cabin
those
cases
and
ones
that
--
a
way
that
would
allow
those
cases
to
survive,
yet
to
distinguish
section
26.
one
point
that
we
haven't
discussed
much
is
the
democratic
process,
and
it's
important
that
i
emphasize
that,
obviously,
the
use
of
race-based
and
sex-based
preferences
in
college
education
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
hotly
contested
issues
of
our
time.
and
some
believe
that
those
preferences
are
necessary
for
campus
diversity.
others
think
that
they
are
not
necessary,
and
in
fact
that
we
would
have
a
much
better
world
if
we
moved
past
the
discussion
about
race
and
instead
based
it
on
race-neutral
criteria.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
we
have
a
muddy
picture.
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
the
first
thing
that
we
have
is
the
actual
statistics
for
the
first
full
year
after
section
26
went
into
effect.
this
is
2008.
and
what
we
find
is
that
the
number
of
underrepresented
minorities
as
part
of
the
entering
freshman
class
at
michigan
as
a
percentage
changed
very
little.
it
went
from
about
10-3/4
percent
to
about
10-1/4
percent.
then
it
gets
very
difficult
to
track,
because,
following
the
u.s.
census's
lead,
in
2010
the
university
of
michigan
stopped
requiring
students
to
check
only
a
single
box
to
demonstrate
what
their
race
or
ethnicity
was
and
moved
to
a
multiple
checkbox
system.
and
justice
sotomayor,
when
you
see
in
the
amici
briefs
that
there
has
been
a
dramatic
drop,
for
example,
in
african
american
students
on
campus
at
the
university
of
michigan,
those
numbers
don't
take
into
account
that
people
who
before
were
forced
to
check
a
single
box
now
could
be
checking
multiple
boxes.
and
if
you
fold
in
the
multiple
checkbox
students,
the
number
of
underrepresented
minorities
on
campus
actually
comes
out
higher.
now,
we
don't
know
what
those
numbers
are,
because
you
could
have
a
student
who
might
be
white
and
asian
and
they
would
not
be
considered
an
underrepresented
minority,
and
they
could
be
in
there;
but
we
know
that
the
numbers
are
a
lot
closer
than
when
you
just
look
at
single
checkbox
students
in
isolation.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
the
statistics
in
california
across
the
17
campuses
in
the
university
of
california
system
show
that
today
the
underrepresented
minority
percentage
is
better
on
16
out
of
those
17
campuses.
it's
not
at
berkeley;
they
haven't
gotten
there
yet;
but
it's
better
on
the
rest.
and
by
going
to
race-neutral
criteria,
what
they
discovered
was
that
underrepresented
minority
students
have
higher
gpas,
that
they
take
more
technology,
engineering
and
math
classes,
and
they
have
a
graduation
rate
that
is
20
to
25
percent
higher
than
it
was
before
california's
proposition
209.
you
can
see
similar
effects
in
texas
in
their
top
10
percent
program
before
it
was
modified.
and
not
only
did
it
have
those
positive
impacts,
but
it
actually
increased
minority
performance
at
social-economically
disadvantaged
high
schools,
where
the
students
said:
hey,
if
i
can
only
get
into
the
top
10
percent
of
my
class,
i
can
be
in
the
university
of
texas
at
austin.
and
again,
we
can
all
agree
that
diversity
on
campus
is
a
goal
that
should
be
pursued.
what
the
california
and
texas
experiences
have
demonstrated
is
that
there
are
good,
positive
reasons
why
the
voters
might
want
to
try
a
race-neutral
alternative.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
as--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--you've
put
your
finger
on
the
fulcrum
of
respondents'
best
argument,
that
only
race
as
a
factor
alone
has
been
removed.
and
there
their
argument
is
exactly
backwards,
because
it's
not
michigan
or
section
26
that
single
out
race.
it's
the
equal
protection
clause
itself,
because,
justice
sotomayor,
if
a
student
wants
to
lobby
for
an
alumni
preference
or
a
cello
preference
and
put
it
in
the
state
constitution,
strict
scrutiny
is
never
applied
to
that
effort.
but
when
you
try
to
get
a
preference
based
on
race
or
not
based
on
race
in
the
federal
--
or
the
state
constitution,
strict
scrutiny
is
always
applied.
and
so
it's
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
making
a
differentiation
between
race
and
everything
else.
and
that's
why
this
court
in
crawford,
again
decided
the
same
day
as
seattle,
at
page
538,
recognized,
quote,
"a
distinction
between
state
action
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
race
and
state
action
that
addresses
in
neutral
fashion
race-related
matters.
"
and
section
26
falls
into
that
latter
category.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
and
i'm
glad
that
you
brought
that
up,
chief
justice
roberts,
because
affirmative
action
means
a
lot
more
than
simply
the
use
of
race
or
sex-based
preferences
in
university
admissions.
the
--
article
i,
section
26,
only
focuses
on
this
one
aspect
of
university
admissions.
now,
another
important
point
to
understand
is
that
section
26
is
not
all
about
university
admissions.
this
is
actually
a
much
broader
law
that
applies
not
just
to
race
and
ethnicity,
but
also
to
sex
and
other
factors,
and
that
affects
not
just
universities
but
also
public
contracting
and
public
employment.
this
was
a
broad-based
law
that
was
primarily
motivated
by
the
people
of
michigan's
decision
to
move
past
the
day
when
we
are
always
focused
on
race,
exactly
as
grutter
invited
the
states
to
do.
and
you
can
--
you
can
see
how
that
discussion
gets
mired
when
you
look
at
some
of
these
statistics
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
is
someone
who
has
multiple
racial
boxes
checked
more
or
less
diverse
than
someone
who
only
has
one
box
checked?
is
someone
who
comes
from
outside
the
country
--
say
from
mexico--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
that's
not
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
again,
it
actually
runs
the
other
way,
because
equal
protection
is
what
singles
out
race-focused
measures
for
strict
scrutiny.
but
what
we're
saying
is
under
grutter,
race
preferences
are
barely
permissible.
it
cannot
be
unconstitutional
for
the
people
to
choose
not
to
use
them
anymore,
to
accept
this
court's
invitation
in
grutter,
to
move
past
the
discussion
about
race
and
into
a
race-neutral
future.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
under
what
we're
going
to
call
the
narrow
“
save
hunter
and
seattle
”,
something
like
that
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
removes
an
antidiscrimination
provision
and
moves
it
to
a
higher
level
of
government.
now,
one
of
the
problems
with
keeping
that
doctrine
is
it
could
also
work
the
opposite
way.
you
know,
pretend
that
the
political
climate
in
michigan
was
turned
on
its
head
and
that
universities
had
agreed
that
they
were
no
longer
going
to
use
race
or
sex
in
admissions
and
that
it
was
the
state
electorate,
either
in
the
legislature
or
in
the
constitution,
which
imposed
a
grutter
plan
on
everyone.
well,
under
hunter
and
seattle,
that
would
have
to
go
because
that
law
removes
an
antidiscrimination
provision
and
moves
it
to
the
higher
level.
and
so
that
would
be
one
reason
why
you
might
want
to
take
the
washington
v.
davis
approach
and
consider
whether
there's
discriminatory
animus
based
on
race.
but,
you
know,
in
either
of
those
cases,
i
think
you
can
either,
you
know,
pare
down
the
doctrine
or
get
rid
of
it
entirely
and
distinguish
our
case
from
it.
but
the
one
point
that
i
want
to
leave
you
with
today
is
that
the
--
the
core
of
respondent's
arguments
that
somehow
a
racial
classification
can
be
any
law
that
has
a
racial
focus,
cannot
be
the
right
test.
no
matter
what,
that
portion
of
seattle
and
hunter
has
to
go,
because
equal
protection
is
about
protecting
individuals,
not
about
protecting
laws;
and
even
nondiscriminatory
race-neutral
laws
that
have
a
racial
focus
would
fall
under
their
racial
focus
test.
you
know,
the
hypothetical
we
give
in
our
briefs
on
that,
besides
a
state
equal
protection
clause,
would
be
the
federal
fair
housing
act
because
it
references
race,
it
has
a
racial
focus,
in
the
words
of
seattle
and
hunter,
and
it
has
the
ability
of
preventing
anyone
from
lobbying
for
preferences
based
on
their
race
or
sex
at
lower
levels
of
the
government,
either
state
or
local.
so
under
their
theory,
the
federal
fair
housing
act
would
have
to
be
applied
under
strict
scrutiny.
and
their
only
response
to
that
in
the
brief
is
that:
well,
the
supremacy
clause
takes
care
of
that
problem.
and
we
all
know
supremacy
doesn't
kick
in
until
you
first
determine
that
the
federal
law
itself
is
constitutional,
and
it
wouldn't
be
under
their
theory.
so
--
so
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
is
eliminate
that
portion
of
hunter
and
seattle
that
suggests
that
a
law's
racial
focus
is
the
sine
qua
non
of
a
political
restructuring
doctrine
test
and
to
either--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
two
thoughts
on
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
under
grutter,
this
court
made
crystal
clear
that
a
grutter
plan
is
not
about
which
minority
group
is
being
advantaged
or
disadvantaged.
it's
supposed
to
benefit
the
campus
as
a
whole.
and
to
the
extent
the
claim
is
that
preferences
benefit
certain
classes
of
minorities
and
not
others,
you
know,
for
example,
it
benefits
african
americans
and
latinos,
but
not
asians,
even
though
they're
both
discrete
and
insular
underrepresented
groups,
that
--
then
it
fails
under
grutter.
it
can
only
be
something
that
benefits
everybody.
but
more
fundamentally,
going
back
to
your
question
about
the
origin
of
the
doctrine,
i
think
it's
really
important
to
understand
why
we
have
hunter,
because
hunter,
remember,
was
decided
before
washington
v.
davis.
and
when
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
law
in
akron,
ohio
in
hunter,
there's
nothing
in
there
that
would
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
and
so
this
court
was
searching
for
another
way
to
--
to
strike
down
a
law
that
removed
an
antidiscrimination
provision
and
made
it
more
difficult
to
reenact
at
the
higher
level
of
the
political
process.
it
needed
something
to
fix
that.
and
our
point
is
you
can
either
construe
it
to
do
exactly
that,
that
only
antidiscrimination
laws
being
struck
down
and
moved
to
a
higher
level
can
satisfy
a
political
restructuring
doctrine,
or
you
can
look
at
it
differently.
you
can
say:
now
that
we've
got
washington
v.
davis
and
we
all
know
what
the
intent
was
in
akron,
that
that
is
a
simpler
way
to
address
this
--
this
problem
and
we
really
don't
need
the
political
restructuring
doctrine
at
all
anymore.
but
the
reason
why
we
had
the
doctrine
in
hunter
is
because
strict
scrutiny
did
not
apply.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
it
was
not.
but
it
wasn't
a
finding.
it
was
actually
more
than
that.
it
was
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
the
district
court
correctly
concluded
there
wasn't
even
a
question
of
disputed
material
fact
as
to
whether
intent
was
the
primary
motivation
of
the
electorate.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
going
to
start
with
a
sentence
from
crawford,
decided
the
same
day
as
seattle,
where
this
court
defined
what
a
racial
classification
is:
a
racial
classification
either
says
or
implies
that
persons
are
to
be
treated
differently
on
account
of
race.
"it
doesn't
say
anything
about
laws
with
or
without
a
racial
focus.
"
"and
we
think
that
is
the
test
that
ultimately
should
come
out
of
the
decision
in
this
case.
"
now,
my
friends
on
the
other
side
disagree
with
that,
because
if
that's
the
test
section
26
is
constitutional.
and
so
they
draw
this
false
dichotomy
between
laws
that
involve
race
and
laws
that
don't
involve
race;
we
will
put
them
in
two
separate
chambers
of
the
legislature
and
charge
a
fee
if
you
want
to
talk
about
--
about
race.
and
we
know
that
can't
be
right,
because
of,
chief
justice
roberts,
your
observation
that
the
whole
point
of
equal
protection
is
to
take
race
off
the
table
when
everyone
is
being
treated
the
same.
that's
why
they
can't--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
two
problems
with
that.
first
that's
where
the
respondent's
theory
most
closely
knocks
up
against
grutter,
because
you
are
right:
under
seattle
and
hunter
you've
got
to
have
a
policy
designed
for
the
purpose
of
primarily
benefitting
the
minority.
but
if
that's
the
policy,
it
violates
grutter,
which
is
supposed
to
benefit
everyone.
but
the
bigger
problem
is
if
you
treat
a--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right,
but
the
bigger
problem--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--but
justice
sotomayor,
the
biggest
problem
with
respondents'
test,
with
applying
the
literal
language
of
seattle,
is
that
as
i
said,
the
federal
fair
housing
act,
the
equal
credit
act,
a
state
equal
protection
law
that
mentions
--
all
of
these
things
fall
in
the
category
of
laws
dealing
with
race.
some
are
discriminatory.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
that
would
still
invalidate
the
michigan
equal
protection
clause
which
has
a
racial
focus
that
says
you
cannot
discriminate
based
on
race
or
sex,
and
yet
no
one
would
argue
it
should
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
breyer,
the
limitation
has
to
be
not
only
that,
but
also
that
you
are
repealing
an
antidiscrimination
law,
not
an
equal
treatment
law.
or
again,
otherwise
the
state
equal
protection
clause
has
to
fall.
so
to
the
extent
that
i
am
right,
that
is
a
way
that
you
can
narrow
hunter
and
seattle,
and
section
26
has
to
survive.
if
i
am
wrong
about
that,
then
respectfully
seattle
and
hunter
should
be
overruled.
either
way,
it
does
not
violate
equal
protection
to
require
equal
treatment.
thank
you.
