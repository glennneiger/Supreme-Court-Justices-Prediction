chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
12-682,
schuette
v.
the
coalition
to
defend
affirmative
action.
mr.
bursch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
been
asked
several
questions
that
refer
to
the
ending
or
termination
of
affirmative
action.
that's
not
what
is
at
issue
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
--
the
board
delegated
to
the
various
universities
the
authority
to
develop
their
own
admissions
programs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
did,
and
then
after
several
years
they
decided,
you
know,
we
don't
like
the
way
it's
working;
they're
adopting
too
many
racial
preference
programs;
we're
going
to
revoke
the
delegation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that
any
--
any
different?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
there
were
a
provision
in
the
michigan
constitution
that
says
the
board
of
regents
is
authorized
to
enact
these
programs,
in
other
words
delegated
from
the
people
in
the
constitution
to
the
board,
and
then
the
people
change
the
delegation
by
saying,
no,
it's
no
longer
--
we're
no
longer
going
to
leave
that
up
to
the
board,
we're
going
to
make
the
decision
ourselves
in
the
constitution,
how
is
that
any
different?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
mean,
you
could
say
that
the
whole
point
of
something
like
the
equal
protection
clause
is
to
take
race
off
the
table.
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
state
to
say,
look,
race
is
a
lightning
rod.
we've
been
told
we
can
have
affirmative
action
programs
that
do
not
take
race
into
account.
socioeconomic
diversity,
elimination
of
alumnae
preferences,
all
of
these
things.
it
is
very
expensive.
whenever
we
have
a
racial
classification,
we're
immediately
sued.
so
why
don't
we
say
we
want
you
to
do
everything
you
can
without
having
racial
preferences.
now,
if
the
litigation
determines
that
we're
required
to
have
racial
preferences,
this
statute
has
an
exception
and
--
and
allows
that.
but
starting
out,
we
want
to
take
race
off
the
table
and
try
to
achieve
diversity
without
racial
preferences.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
driver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
what
extent
--
to
what
extent
does
your
argument
depend
--
i
thought
both
hunter
and
seattle
speak
in
these
terms
--
that
the
policies
that
are
more
difficult
to
enact
are
beneficial
for
the
minority
group.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
what
extent
does
your
argument
depend
upon
the
assumption
that
the
programs
that
you
say
are
now
more
difficult
to
enact
are
beneficial
to
the
minority
group?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
do
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
what
if
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
benefit
to
the
minority
group
is
more
open
to
debate,
whether
it's
through
the
mismatch
theory
that
taylor
and
sander
i
guess
have
adopted,
or
other
theories?
do
we
have
to
assume
in
your
favor
that
these
definitely
are
beneficial
to
particular
minority
groups?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
may
be
a
difference
between
popularity
and
benefit.
in
other
words,
you
want
us
to
assume
that
the
programs
are
beneficial
to
a
minority
group?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bursch,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
