justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
an
accurate
description
of
seattle?
i
thought
that
in
seattle,
before
the
school
board
adopted
the
bussing
plan,
the
city
was
threatened
with
lawsuits
by
the
department
of
justice,
by
the
federal
government,
and
by
private
plaintiffs,
claiming
that
the
--
the
previous
pupil
assignment
plan
was
--
involved
de
jure
segregation.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
answer
to
that
question.
as
to
seattle
itself,
is
it
not
the
case
that
they
were
threatened
with
litigation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
isn't
it
correct
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
de
jure
segregation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
didn't?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
the
whole
purpose
of
strict
scrutiny
was
to
say
that
if
you
want
to
talk
about
race,
you
have
a
much
higher
hurdle
to
climb
than
if
you
want
to
talk
about
something
else.
now,
you
can
argue
that
strict
scrutiny
should
only
apply
to
minorities
and
not
to
students
who
are
not
minorities,
but
i
thought
the
court
decided
that
a
long
time
ago.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
i
don't
know
why
that's
a
hard
question
that
you
asked
about
the
student
who
says,
i
want
to
talk
about
race.
what
if
it's
a
white
student
who
comes
in
and
says:
i
want
to
talk
about
race;
i'm
white
and
therefore
you
should
admit
me,
you
should
give
me
preference.
the
state
can't
say,
no,
we
don't
want
to
hear
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
your
answer
then.
if
the
student
--
one
student
comes
in
and
says
i
want
to
talk
about
how
well
i
play
the
cello,
all
right,
we'll
listen
to
that.
i
want
to
come
in
and
talk
about
why
i
as
a
white
person
should
get
a
preference;
you
have
to
listen
to
that
because
you're
listening
to
the
--
to
the
talk
about
the
cello,
too?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
proposal
2
had
been
in
the
michigan
constitution
before
any
affirmative
action
program
was
adopted,
would
the
result
be
the
same?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
--
can
i
come
back
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
were
asking
before?
essentially,
it's
their
question.
let's
say
that
the
--
the
decision
about
admissions
criteria
across
the
board
is
basically
delegated
to
the
faculty.
all
right?
and
the
faculty
adopts
some
sort
of
affirmative
action
plan.
and
now
that
is
overruled
in
favor
of
a
colorblind
approach
at
various
levels
going
up
the
ladder.
so
maybe
it's
overruled
by
the
--
the
dean
of
--
by
a
dean,
or
maybe
it's
overruled
by
the
president
of
the
university.
maybe
it's
overruled
by
the
regents.
maybe,
if
state
laws
allowed,
it's
--
it's
overruled
by
an
executive
department
of
the
state.
maybe
it's
overruled
by
the
legislature
through
ordinary
legislation.
maybe
it's
overruled
through
a
constitutional
amendment.
at
what
point
does
the
political
restructuring
doctrine
kick
in?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
really
--
that
really
isn't
responsive
to
my
question.
let's
say
exactly
what
was
done
here
is
done
at
all
of
these
levels.
at
what
point
does
the
doctrine
kick
in?
when
it
goes
from
the
faculty
to
the
dean?
from
the
dean
to
the
president,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
where
does
this
apply?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
would
that
be
true
--
i'm
sorry.
would
that
be
true
if
they
had
never
gotten
involved
in
admissions
criteria
before?
they
have
the
authority,
but
they
left
that
to
the
university
officials.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
consistent
with
justice
sotomayor's
answer
to
my
question.
don't
the
people
of
michigan
have
--
don't
the
people
of
michigan
have
plenary
authority?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
seattle
and
this
case
both
involve
constitutional
--
seattle
and
this
case
both
involve
constitutional
amendments.
so
why
can't
the
law
--
the
law
be
drawn
--
the
line
be
drawn
there?
if
you
change
the
allocation
of
power
in
one
of
these
less
substantial
ways,
that's
one
thing;
but
when
you
require
a
constitutional
amendment
that's
really
a
big
deal.
