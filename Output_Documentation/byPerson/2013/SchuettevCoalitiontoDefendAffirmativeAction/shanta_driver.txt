ms.
shanta
driver
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
this
court
to
uphold
the
sixth
circuit
decision
to
reaffirm
the
doctrine
that's
expressed
in
hunter-seattle,
and
to
bring
the
14th
amendment
back
to
its
original
purpose
and
meaning,
which
is
to
protect
minority
rights
against
a
white
majority,
which
did
not
occur
in
this
case.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think
it
is
--
it's
a
measure
that's
an
antidiscrimination
measure.
ms.
shanta
driver
and
it's
a
measure
in
which
the
question
of
discrimination
is
determined
not
just
by
--
by
power,
by
who
has
privilege
in
this
society,
and
those
minorities
that
are
oppressed,
be
they
religious
or
racial,
need
protection
from
a
more
privileged
majority.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think
that--
ms.
shanta
driver
--no
case
of
yours.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think
that
affirmative
action
programs
could
--
could
be
permissible
under
employment.
for
instance--
ms.
shanta
driver
--that's
right.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think--
ms.
shanta
driver
--no.
i
think
these
are
very
fact-based
determinations.
and
so,
somebody
could
make
a
decision
that
they
wanted
to
use
what
you're
calling
racial
preferences.
and
that
could
mean
a
range
of
things,
and
that
could
be
subject
to
a
veto
higher
up.
yeah,
i
agree
with
you.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think
hunter-seattle
provides
the
line.
i
think
it
says
that
if
you
have
a
law
that
has
a
racial
focus,
and
that
law,
part
of
proving
that
it
has
a
racial
focus,
is
that
it
takes
a
benefit
that
inures
to
minorities
and
it
removes
that
benefit
and
it
restructures
the
political
process
and
places
a
special
burden
on
minorities
to
re-ascertain
that
right,
yeah,
i
think
that's
a
proper
rule.
because
it's
--
it's--
ms.
shanta
driver
--i
think
in
this
case,
the
difference
between
what
other
groups
can
do
in
order
to
get
preferential
treatment
for
their
sons
and
daughters
and
what
racial
minorities
are
subject
to,
the
level
of
distinction
places
such
a
high
burden
on
minorities.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think
it
depends
on
where
it
is
that
minorities
face
a
heavier
and
special
burden.
ms.
shanta
driver
you
have,
you
restated
it
very
well,
and
i
agree
with
you
in
principle.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
don't
think
it
--
i
don't
think
hunter-seattle
applies.
ms.
shanta
driver
i
think
you
need
two
things:
i
think
you
need
the
decisionmaking
--
the
decisionmaking
body.
if
the
university
of
michigan
regents
decided
tomorrow
to
eliminate
affirmative
action
programs
and
there
was
no
prop
2,
they
have
the
legal
right
to
do
that.
they
are
the
decision-making
body.
and
minorities
still
could
go
and
lobby
the
regents,
still
could
go
and
talk
about
the
questions
of
racial
equality
difference--
ms.
shanta
driver
--i
think
if
they
have
the
plenary
authority
to
do
that,
yeah,
i
think
that,
again,
if
they
wanted
to
eliminate
affirmative
action
programs
and
they
had
that
plenary
authority
and
it
was
guaranteed
by
the
michigan
state
constitution
and
it
had
existed
for
150
years,
and
they
chose
to
enter
this
area,
i
think--
ms.
shanta
driver
--in
this
case,
the
particular
--
it's
--
they
are
applying
that
plenary
authority
in
--
or
in
a
way
that
is
racially
focused,
and
creates
a
political
process
that
is
disadvantageous
to
minorities.
ms.
shanta
driver
this
--
what
we're
talking
about
in
terms
of
affirmative
action
are
constitutionally
permissible
programs
that
were
shown
to
this
court
to
be
the
only
way
to
achieve
racial
diversity
and
integration
at
the
university
of
michigan.
and
whether
you
--
whether
you
explain
that
by
looking
at
the
reality
of
the
inequality
in
education
for
black
and
white
michigan
or
whatever
it
is
that
you
come
up
with
that
requires
that,
the
university
has
shown
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
diversity
in
which
racial
diversity
is
a
part
of
the
--
is
a
part
of
the
quotient.
and
so
to
take
away
that
right
from
the
university
and
from
the
regents
--
and
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
answered.
if
you
look
at
the
law
schools,
the
medical
schools,
the
professional
schools
now
in
the
state
of
michigan,
there's
been
a
precipitous
drop
in
underrepresented
minority
enrollment
in
those
schools.
we
are
going
back
to
the
resegregation
of
those
schools
because
of
the
elimination
of
affirmative
action.
ms.
shanta
driver
the
--
say
that
--
i'm
sorry.
can
you
repeat--
ms.
shanta
driver
--i
think
it's
an
important
component
part,
because
i
think
it's
in
the
benefit
to
the
minority
group
that
it's
especially
important--
ms.
shanta
driver
--that
the
political
process
be
on
a
level
field.
ms.
shanta
driver
certainly
the
minority
voters
of
michigan
believe
them
to
be,
because
90
percent
of
black
voters
in
michigan
voted
against
prop
2.
and
i
think
that
that's
a
clear
indication
of
the
popularity
of
these
programs
and
the
perceived
benefit
of
these
programs.
ms.
shanta
driver
yes.
and
they
are
beneficial
to
minority
groups.
they
may
--
they
may
serve
to
provide
benefits
for
the
population
beyond
minority
groups,
but
they
are
a
benefit
if
they--
ms.
shanta
driver
--it's
a
debatable
question
in
another
forum
in
a
different
case,
and
in
fact
i
think
that
case
was
the
grutter
case.
this
case
isn't
about
--
isn't
just
about
whether
or
not
affirmative
action
benefits
minorities.
it's
also
the
restructuring
of
the
political
process
and
the
special
burden
that's
placed
on
minorities.
it's
not
--
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
debating
the
--
whether
affirmative
action--
ms.
shanta
driver
--no,
i--
ms.
shanta
driver
--i
think
it's
a
two-part
test.
i
think
the
first,
the
first
thing
that
you
look
at
is,
is
there
a
racial
focus
to
the
law,
and
is
the
benefit
that's
been
taken
away
something
that
inures
to
minorities.
and
i
think
the
second
part
of
the
test,
and
that's
why
i
think
seattle/hunter
is
such
a
narrow
doctrine,
is
whether
there
also
has
been
a
restructuring
of
the
political
process
and
a
special
burden
placed
on
minorities.
it
requires
both.
