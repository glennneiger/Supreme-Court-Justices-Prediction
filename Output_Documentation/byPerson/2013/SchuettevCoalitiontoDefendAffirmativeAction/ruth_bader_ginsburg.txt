mr.
bursch,
could
you
go
back--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
--
there
was
no
proof
that
there
was
any
de
jure
segregation
in
seattle.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
such
a
claim
in
this
case,
it
just
wasn't
decided
--
wasn't
there
a
racial
animus,
that
the
reason
for
proposition
2
was
to
reduce
the
minority
population?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
get
to
that,
but
there
was
such
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bursch,
can
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
very
first
thing
you
said,
because
i
didn't
get
your
--
your
point.
the
question:
what
impact
has
the
termination
of
affirmative
action
had
on
michigan,
on
the
enrollment
of
minorities
in
the
university
of
michigan?
do
we
have
any
clear
picture
of
that,
what
effect
the
repeal
of
affirmative
action
has
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bursch,
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
the
position
that
was
taken
in
seattle
derived
from
a
different
view
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
i
mean,
strict
scrutiny
was
originally
put
forward
as
a
protection
for
minorities
--
a
protection
for
minorities
against
hostile
disadvantageous
legislation.
and
so
the
view
then
was
we
use
strict
scrutiny
when
the
majority
is
disadvantaging
the
minority.
so
you
do,
under
the
carolene
products
view,
you
do
focus
on
race
and
you
ask,
is
the
minority
being
disadvantaged?
if
that
were
the
view,
then
i
suppose
we
would
not
be
looking
at
this,
well,
the
criterion
is
race
and
wherever
the
disadvantage
falls,
whether
a
majority
or
minority,
it's
just
the
same.
that
wasn't
the
original
idea
of
when
strict
scrutiny
is
appropriate.
so
if
we
were
faithful
to
that
notion,
that
it
is
--
measures
a
disadvantage
the
--
the
minority
that
get
strict
scrutiny.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
the
district
court
found
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
discriminatory
intent,
but
that
wasn't
reviewed
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
quoted
--
you
quoted
from
crawford.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
is
an
opposing
quote
in
seattle
itself
on
page,
what
is
it,
486?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"when
the
state's
allocation
of
power
places
unusual
burdens
on
the
ability
of
racial
groups
to
enact
legislation
designed
to
overcome
the
special
condition
of
prejudice,
the
governmental
action
seriously
curtails
the
operation
of
those
political
processes
ordinarily
to
be
relied
on
to
protect
minorities.
"
and
it
quotes
carolene
products.
so
--
and
then
the
following
sentence
is:
"in
the
most
direct
sense,
this
implicates
the
judiciary's
special
role,
not
of
treating
the
individuals
as
individuals,
but
the
judiciary's
special
role
in
safeguarding
the
interests
of
those
groups
that
are
relegated
to
a
position
of
political
powerlessness.
"
so
the
rationale
of
seattle
is
that
notion
that
we
can't
put
hurdles
in
the
way
of
a
disadvantaged
minority.
