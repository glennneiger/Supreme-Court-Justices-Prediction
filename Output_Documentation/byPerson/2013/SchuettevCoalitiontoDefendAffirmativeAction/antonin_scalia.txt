why
--
why
doesn't
the
fourth
amendment
violate
the
rule
you're
saying
--
or
the
14th
amendment
violate
the
rule
that
you're
proposing?
i
mean,
i'm
a
minority
and
i
want
laws
that
favor
my
minority.
not
just
in
university;
everywhere.
my
goodness,
i
can't
have
that
through
the
normal
legislative
process.
i
have
to
get
a
constitutional
amendment
to
do
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
i
guess
--
i
guess
that
on
this
subject
of
equal
treatment
of
the
races,
we
can
eliminate
racism
just
at
the
--
at
the
legislative
level,
can't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
can't
change
those
rules
by
normal
legislation,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you're
a
minority
that
wants
favored
treatment,
you're
just
out
of
luck.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
constitutional
amendment
is
not
the
ordinary
political
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
racial
classification.
you
should
not
refer
to
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
prohibition
of
racial
classifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
every
prohibition
of
racial
classification
is
itself
a
racial
classification?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
how
you're
using
racial
classification,
i
thought
it
meant,
you
know,
it's
directed
at
blacks
or
asians--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
--
no.
in
that
sense,
the
14th
amendment
itself
is
a
racial
classification,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
that
sense,
the
14th
amendment
itself
is
a
racial
classification.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness,
i
thought
we've
--
we've
held
that
the
14th
amendment
protects
all
races.
i
mean,
that
was
the
argument
in
the
early
years,
that
it
protected
only
--
only
the
blacks.
but
i
thought
we
rejected
that.
you
--
you
say
now
that
we
have
to
proceed
as
though
its
purpose
is
not
to
protect
whites,
only
to
protect
minorities?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
unless
that
exists,
the
14th
amendment
is
not
violated;
is
that
right?
so
if
you
have
a
banding
together
of
various
minority
groups
who
discriminate
against
--
against
whites,
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
case
of
ours
that
propounds
that
view
of
the
14th
amendment,
that
it
protects
only
minorities?
any
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
opponent
says
otherwise.
he
says
that
minority
students
have
taken
tougher
courses,
they
have
been
better
qualified
to
be
admitted,
and
all
sorts
of
other
benefits.
so
it's
certainly
a
debatable
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
changing
your
answer,
then.
your
answer
to
the
chief
was
it
does
depend
and
now
you
are
saying
it
doesn't
depend
on
whether
it
benefits
minorities
at
all;
it's
just
whether
it
places
a
--
a
greater
burden
on
minorities
to
change
it.
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
or
the
other?
