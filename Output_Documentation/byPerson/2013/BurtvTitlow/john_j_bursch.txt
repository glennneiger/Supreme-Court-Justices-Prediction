mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
court
has
ever
held
that
aedpa
and
strickland
can
be
satisfied
by
presumption
based
on
a
silent
record.
yet
that
is
precisely
the
approach
the
sixth
circuit
adopted
in
granting
habeas
relief
here.
the
record
doesn't
say
how
attorney
toca
investigated
or
what
advice
attorney
toca
gave,
but
based
on
that
record
silence,
the
sixth
circuit
assumed
toca
was
ineffective.
and
under
aedpa
and
strickland,
the
presumptions
run
the
opposite
way.
now,
if
there's
one
thing
that
the
court
takes
away
from
the
oral
argument
this
morning,
i
hope
that
it's
--
it's
this:
how
upside
down
the
sixth
circuit's
analysis
is
when
it
says
on
page
19a
of
the
petition
appendix
that
toca
was
deficient
because
the
record
contains
no
evidence
that
he
advised
titlow
about
elements,
evidence,
or
sentencing
exposure.
the
correct
question
is
whether
the
record
contains
evidence
that
toca
did
not
do
those
things.
and
that
record
silence
is
dispositive
in
favor
of
the
state
on
habeas
review.
now,
if
we
could
pull
the
curtain
back
and
see
what
really
happened
here,
it
may
be
the
case
that
toca
gave
the
proper
advice,
that
he
advised
titlow
about
all
the
perils
of
going
to
trial,
and
that
titlow
continued
to
maintain
her
innocence.
under
strickland,
we're
supposed
to
presume
that
toca
did
exactly
that,
especially
when
it's
titlow's
burden
to
satisfy
the
burden
of
proof,
and
she
failed
to
do
that.
so
i'd
like
to
begin
with
our
first
issue,
which
is
aedpa
deference
and
the
performance
prong
of
strickland.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
i
don't
think
he's
--
he's
saying
that,
justice
ginsburg.
he's
saying
i'm
not
prepared
for
trial
yet.
but
he
says,
i've
got
a
lot
of
materials
here.
he
goes
through
a
very
sophisticated
sentencing
analysis
with
the
--
the
sentencing
court
in
this
plea
withdrawal
hearing.
if
you
understand
michigan
sentencing,
if
you've
got
a
manslaughter
charge,
there's
a
grid.
and
there's
all
kinds
of
different
boxes
that
this
could
have
fit
into,
and
he
would
have
had
to
have
analyzed
the
evidence
in
order
to
determine
that
the
two
to
five
range
was
appropriate
for
a
manslaughter
conviction,
and
to
be
able
to
then
negotiate
with
the
prosecutor
about
whether
that
was
or
was
not
appropriate.
and
so
we
know
that
--
that
toca
did
a
lot
of
work.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes,
it
was.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
don't
recall,
but
it's
something
on
the
range
of
15
to
20
years.
and
when
we're
talking
about
guidelines,
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand
the
difference
between
what
the
guidelines
called
for,
for
manslaughter
and
what
was
in
the
plea
agreement,
because
michigan's
got
this
indeterminate
sentencing
system
where
you've
got
a
range
for
the
lower
end.
and
so
the
plea
deal
was
7
to
15
years
on
the
lower
end.
and
a
manslaughter
conviction
--
that
is,
if
they
had
gone
to
trial
and
lost
for
manslaughter,
the
lower
end
was
2
years
to
5
years.
and
so
it
was
entirely
reasonable,
from
an
objective
perspective,
for
an
attorney,
looking
at
this
record
at
the
time
the
plea
was
withdrawn,
to
say,
yes,
if
you
want
to
maintain
your
innocence,
the
most
likely
bad
result
at
trial
is
most
likely
better
than
the
plea
deal
that
you
already
have.
sure,
there's
a
risk
that
something
worse
could
happen,
but
this
court
has
said
in
strickland
and
lafler
and
other
places
that
bad
predictions
are
not
deficient
performance.
and
so
really,
when
you
get
down
to
it,
it's
really
a
problem
with
both
the
advice
being
reasonable,
but
also
the
failure
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
it's
just
the
case
that
titlow
has
not
come
forward
to
demonstrate,
as
he
was
required
to
do
--
she
was
required
to
do
on
the
record
what
titlow
--
or
what
toca
did
to
investigate
and
what
advice
toca
actually
gave
to
titlow.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
i
think
that's
an
important
factor.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
that's
a
significant
factor
because,
as
you
point
out,
before
the
ink
was
even
dry
on
the
plea
agreement,
titlow
was
already
in
prison
saying,
i'm
innocent.
maybe
i
should
be
withdrawing
this
plea,
setting
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
that
resulted
in
her
firing
the
first
attorney
and
then
hiring
a
second
attorney.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
articulated
any
kind
of
a
--
a
per
se
rule
about
that.
you
know,
certainly
we
all
understand
that
the
ethical
obligation
of
the
lawyer
is
that
if
your
client
insists
that
they
want
to
maintain
their
innocence,
you
have
to
allow
them
to
do
that.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
at
pages
100
to
101a
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
looked
at
that.
but
it
also
looked
at
the
other
evidence.
it
looked
at
the
strickland
presumption
that
toca
did
his
job.
and
then
it
says
at
the
very
conclusion
of
that
sentence,
based
on
all
the
proofs
and
arguments
presented,
titlow
failed
to
satisfy
her
burden.
this
instance
is
one
part
of
that.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
just
to
be
clear
about
michigan
procedure,
the
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
a
right
to
ask
for
what's
called
a
ginther
hearing
in
michigan,
and
that's
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
develop
a
record
for
an
ineffective
assistance
claim.
titlow
did
not
ask
for
that
hearing
in
the
trial
court.
she
did
ask
for
it
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
but
under
the
michigan
court
rules
--
this
is
7.211(c)(1)(a)(2)
--
she
was
required
to
make
a
proffer
to
justify
that
hearing
on
this
motion
to
remand.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals,
before
it
issued
its
merits
opinion,
issues
a
one-sentence
order
that
says:
the
motion
to
remand
is
denied
because
you
have
not
proffered
enough
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
a
hearing
is
warranted.
and
that
makes
sense
because
the
only
proffer
was
the
polygraph,
lustig
affidavit
and
the
pierson
affidavit.
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
--
this
often
happens
--
that
titlow
herself
would
have
submitted
an
affidavit
saying:
this
is
what
titlow
knew
--
i'm
sorry:
this
is
what
toca
knew,
this
is
what
toca
advised,
and
i
relied
on
that.
or
sometimes
it's
even
the
case
that
the
previous
defense
counsel
is
willing
to
submit
the
affidavit
that
says:
this
is
what
i
knew,
this
is
the
advice
that
i
gave.
none
of
that
was
there.
and
so
that's
why
you
have
this
denial
of
the
motion.
so
now
in
the
context
of
that
record
and,
justice
kennedy,
the
claim
of
innocence
and
this
whole
thing
being
set
in
motion
by
that
claim
of
innocence,
it
was
quite
easy
for
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
to
say
that,
on
the
proofs
presented
and
in
light
of
the
strickland
presumption,
there
was
nothing
objectively
unreasonable
about
allowing
titlow
to
recall
her
plea.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
defend
the
opinion
if
that
was
the
only
sentence
of
analysis,
because
we
do
not
agree
that
a
simple
claim
of
innocence
by
your
client
relieves
the
attorney
of
any
responsibility
to
do
anything.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
four
sentences
before
the
sentence
you
just
read
on
page
101a,
the
court
of
appeals
talks
about
the
strickland
presumption
that
the
attorney
is
doing
his
or
her
job.
two
sentences
after
that
sentence
you
just
read
on
page
102a,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
specifically
says:
"on
the
proofs
and
arguments
offered
by
defendant,
there
is
no
ineffective
assistance
here.
"
and
so
that
was
part
of
a
larger
discussion
about
attorneys
who
do
their
job
when
their
clients
are
claiming
innocence.
and
you
have
to
put
all
that
together.
and
i
think
it's
significant
also
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
giving
titlow
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
here,
because
on
page
100a,
just
one
page
earlier,
it
assumes
titlow's
position,
that
is
that
toca
actually
gave
the
advice
to
withdraw
the
plea.
we
don't
even
know
that,
because
we
don't
have
credible
evidence
in
this
record.
we
don't
have
an
affidavit
from
titlow.
we
don't
have
an
affidavit
from
toca
that
indicates
that
toca
ever
gave
that
advice.
again,
if
you
could
draw
the
curtain
back,
it
may
very
well
have
been
as
we
assume
under
strickland
that
he
totally
and
completely
advised
about
all
the
risks
of
trial
before
the
plea
was
withdrawn.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
a
delightful
question.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
and
i
want
to
start
with
a
record
response
to
distinguish
our
case
from
your
hypothetical
and
then
address
the
habeas
question.
your
hypothetical
assumed
that
the
state
court
only
mentioned
one
of
the
two
reasons,
and
here
obviously
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
innocence.
we've
discussed
that
at
length.
but
on
page
100a
of
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
also
notes
that
the
defendant
moved
to
withdraw
her
plea
because
the
agreed-upon
sentence
exceeded
the
sentencing
guidelines
range.
so
they
are
both
here.
but
assuming
your
hypothetical
that
we
only
had
one
and
not
two,
the
question
is
really
easy
under
2254,
because
so
long
as
the
decision
was
not
a
misapplication
of
this
court's
clearly
established
precedent,
there
is
no
violation
even
if
their
reasoning
might
not
have
been
as
strong
as
it
could
have
been
had
they
mentioned
the
other
reason.
so
next
habeas
question:
does
the
defendant
get
an
opportunity
to
have
a
federal
habeas
hearing
to
further
develop
the
record
about
what
happened?
and
the
answer
is
no,
because
under
2254(e)(1)
and
(e)(2)
there
is
a
presumption
of
correctness
about
everything
that
was
found
in
the
state
court
system.
and
there
is
no
right
to
get
a
federal
evidentiary
record
if
you
have
not
adequately
pursued
your
ability
to
develop
the
record
in
the
state
court.
and
as
justice
alito
has
already
pointed
out,
it
was
titlow's
failure,
not
the
state's
failure,
to
properly
proffer
evidence
to
get
the
ginther
hearing.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
don't
think
that's
significant
because
those
two
things
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
the
defendant
could
believe
in
her
heart
of
hearts
that
she's
innocent
and
at
the
same
time
the
attorney
could
acknowledge
that
there
are
facts
in
the
record
already
admitted
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
that
you
were
guilty
of
manslaughter.
and
so
it
would
not
be
inconsistent
for
that
attorney
to
argue
for
a
lower
guidelines
range
in
the
plea.
and
so
there's
really
nothing
inconsistent
about
that.
but
of
the
important
thing
to
understand
here
is
just
the
failure
of
the
burden
of
proof.
the
sixth
circuit
is
upside-down
when
it
reads
into
the
record's
silence
ineffective
assistance.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
first
i
have
to
disagree
with
the
premise
of
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
toca
made
an
appraisal.
he
had
--
you
know,
the
quote
from
the
plea
withdrawal
hearing
is
“
a
lot
of
materials
”,
and
he
made
a
very
sophisticated
argument
about
what
the
guidelines
range
should
be
and
that
range
was
lower
than
the
plea
actually
offered.
but
what
you
need
to
understand
about
this
testimony
from
titlow
right
here,
this
was
a
plea
for
leniency
at
sentencing.
this
was
not
part
of
the
proffer
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
as
part
of
the
motion
for
remand.
what
titlow
could
have
done
was
submit
her
own
affidavit
or
the
affidavit
from
toca
establishing
whether
this
was
actually
true
or
not.
in
addition,
you've
got
to
take
the
context
of
this
and
juxtapose
it
against
the
other
things
that
titlow
was
saying
at
this
very
same
sentencing
hearing.
and
it's
remarkable
really
that
she
says
both
of
these
things.
she
says
she
feels
sorry
for
her
aunt
billie
for
being
this
manipulating
and
evil
person
and
thanks
god
that
she
did
not
do
what
billie
asked
her
to
do.
and
she
says
it
was
only
because
of
her,
titlow,
that
the
truth
came
out.
so
somehow
it's
still
a
claim
of
innocence,
even
after
trial,
even
after
there
has
been
a
conviction.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
clean-up
points.
starting
with
this
idea
that
the
actual
predicate
was
wrong.
as
we
explained
in
our
briefing
in
the
habeas
pleadings
in
this
very
case,
titlow
already
conceded
that
the
factual
predicate
was
correct.
and
justice
breyer,
you
asked
about
the
quantum
of
proof
necessary
to
overcome
that
assumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
based
on
the
record
before
it
and
actually,
the
legal
standard
under
aedpa
is
not
clearly
wrong.
under
2254(e)(1),
which
is
reprinted
in
our
blue
brief,
it
is
presumed
correct
and
that
presumption
could
only
be
overcome
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
we
don't
have
that
here.
second,
with
respect
to
the
advice,
my
friend
on
the
other
side
points
to
paragraph
8
of
the
pierson
affidavit.
and
it's
a
little
ironic
that
they
put
all
their
eggs
in
that
basket
now
because
in
their
briefing
they
disclaim
it
as
triple
hearsay
and
say
this
court
should
not
rely
on
it
and
she
said
some
things
characterizing
that
paragraph
that
aren't
in
there.
there
is
nothing
in
paragraph
8
or
the
rest
of
the
affidavit
that
says
toca
approached
titlow.
i
don't
think
where
that
comes
from.
but
assume
that
everything
that
she
says
is
correct
and
that
toca
did
give
the
advice
to
withdraw
the
plea,
that
still
doesn't
mean
that
it's
bad
advice
when
you
apply
the
aedpa
and
strickland
rubrics
because,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
the
differentiation
in
the
manslaughter
guidelines
and
what
was
actually
in
the
plea
actually
makes
this
objectively
reasonable
advice.
and,
in
fact,
it's
more
than
that,
because
at
the
time
the
plea
was
withdrawn,
consider
all
the
facts
that
were
known
from
talking
to
the
prosecutor,
looking
in
the
police
file
and
everything
else
that
--
that
toca
presumably
did.
at
that
time,
no
one
knew
about
this
critical
chahine
testimony,
which
only
came
out
at
trial,
that
it
was
actually
titlow
who
held
uncle
don
down
while
he
was
being
smothered.
i
mean,
that
completely
changes
the
complexion
of
this
case.
and
so
to
say
that
titlow
was
always
guilty
when
all
of
her
testimony
up
to
the
point
of
the
plea
withdrawal
had
been,
i
told
my
aunt
billie
to
stop
and
then
i
left
the
scene,
that's
just
not
credible.
point
on
the
second
issue,
the
prejudice
prong.
chief
justice
roberts
and
justice
sotomayor,
you
note
that
the
other
circuits
all
look
at
objective
evidence
and
we
think
that's
the
right
way
to
approach
this.
and
you're
exactly
right,
chief
justice,
that
the
sixth
circuit
takes
a
different
approach.
the
sixth
circuit
says,
although
some
circuits
have
held
that
a
defendant
must
support
his
own
assertion
that
he
would
have
accepted
the
offer
with
additional
objective
evidence,
we,
in
this
circuit,
have
declined
to
adopt
such
a
requirement.
and
you
can
see
how
that
difference
played
out
in
this
very
case,
because
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
look
at
all
the
other
evidence
that
was
in
the
record
that
was
contrary
to
this
self-serving
statement
that
titlow
made;
that
titlow
had
the
plea
in
hand,
and
before
the
ink
was
even
dry,
was
already
professing
innocence
and
talking
to
other
lawyers;
that
she
fired
lustig
and
there
was
no
reason
to
do
that
unless
she
wanted
to
--
to
withdraw
the
plea;
that
she
did
not
have
a
propensity
for
truthfulness.
at
trial,
she
lied
about
the
fact
that
she
was
drunk
when
she
was
not
the
night
of
the
murder.
the
evidence
came
out
that
she
asked
chahine
to
lie
about
the
alibi,
and
she
hid
the
murder
weapon.
and
then
you've
got
all
these
statements
at
the
sentencing
hearing
and
post
remand
where
she's
continually
asserting
her
innocence.
it's
happening
all
the
time.
when
you
consider
all
that
objectively,
under
the
other
circuit
standards,
clearly,
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to
establish
prejudice
here.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
the
objective
evidence.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
here's
--
yeah.
here's
the
connection,
justice
sotomayor.
the
reason
they
didn't
look
at
the
other
evidence
is
because
they
have
a
different
rule.
they
don't
think
they
have
to
look
at
it.
they
did
look
at
things
like
sentencing
disparities.
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
explained,
that
shouldn't
come
into
play
here
because
that
was
a
well-known
disparity;
it
wasn't
something
that
was
hidden
by
client's
ineffective
assistance.
and
they
--
the
sixth
circuit
talks
about
the
fact
that
she
accepted
the
plea
once
and
then
withdrew
it.
obviously,
that
cuts
both
ways.
so
all
you
are
left
with
is
the
subjective
testimony.
and
when
you
look
at
all
the
other
objective
evidence,
the
evidence
that
other
circuits
would
look
at,
there's
really
only
one
possible
outcome
here.
so
in
sum,
your
honors
--
oh,
i
guess
i
do
want
to
mention
one
other
quick
point
since
my
light
hasn't
gone
yet.
the
book
deal.
there
was
no
book
deal.
look
at
page
joint
appendix
60,
and
i've
seen
copyright
assignments.
that
wasn't
the
case
here.
they
were
trying
to
raise
money
for
the
trial.
and
--
and
this
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
reason
why
toca
was
disbarred.
that's
at
joint
appendix
302
to
317.
it
was
because
he
falsely
put
someone
else's
license
tabs
on
his
license
plate
and
that
was
a
misdemeanor
and
then
he
lied
about
it.
in
sum,
record
silence
under
aedpa
and
strickland
means
the
state
wins,
not
the
convicted
murderer.
thank
you.
