justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
ask
a
question
about
what
you
just
said?
the
record
does
show
that
toca
came
into
the
case
very
late
in
the
day,
and
he
asked
to
have
a
postponement
because
he
said,
i
have
to
get
up
to
speed.
i
don't
know
anything
about
this
case.
so
toca
himself
is
saying,
i'm
not
acquainted
with
the
case
--
with
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
the
record
is
silent,
i
am
looking
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
295,
and
this
is
titlow's
statement:
"i
would
have
testified
against
my.
"
"had
i
not
been
persuaded
to
withdraw
my
plea
agreement,
because
an
attorney
promised
me
he
would
represent
me.
"
"he
told
me
he
could
take
my
case
to
trial
and
win.
"
so
that
sounds
like
she
was
persuaded
by
mr.
toca
to
go
to
trial
because
she
could
win.
and
he
had
at
that
point
not
made
any
appraisal
of
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
--
you
made
the
point
that
this
plea
bargain
could
not
be
carried
out
once
the
number
one
condition,
the
prosecutor
said,
you
testify
against
your
aunt
and
then
we'll
give
you
this
deal.
once
the
aunt
is
tried
and
she
doesn't
testify,
there's
no
--
there's
no
plea
bargain.
so
why
isn't
that
enough
to
decide
this
case?
if
you
can't
tell
a
prosecutor
to
renew
a
bargain
that
can't
be
carried
out,
then
it's
become
impossible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
ms.
newman,
if
you
would
agree
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong,
at
least
to
this
extent:
is
there
--
what
is
the
argument
for
directing
a
prosecutor
to
make
a
plea
offer
that
was
never
previously
made?
the
offer
that
was
made
is
impossible
to
carry
out
now.
the
offer
was
conditioned
on
her
testimony
at
her
aunt's
trial.
that
didn't
happen.
so
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
plea
bargain
offered.
and
yet,
the
court
instructs
a
renewal,
instructs
the
prosecutor
to
renew
an
offer
that
doesn't
exist.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
could
--
how
could
this
court
order
the
prosecutor
to
renew
an
offer
that
can't
be
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
whole
--
what
drove
the
prosecutor
to
make
this
bargain
was
he
wanted
the
testimony.
so
how
--
how
can
that
--
that's
--
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this,
where
a
court
orders
a
prosecutor
to
make
a
plea
offer
that
was
never
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
charge
was
--
that
she
was
convicted
of
second-degree
murder,
right?
