justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
we're
asking
whether
the
advice
was
reasonable,
what
force
do
we
give
to
the
proposition
that
a
well-counselled
defendant
was
now
insisting
that
he
wanted
to
change
his
plea?
and
there
was
only
three
days.
how
do
we
factor
that
in?
if
--
if
we
look
at
the
gist
of
what
the
counsel
did--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
may
lead
us
to
one
answer.
but
if
we
know
that
a
previously
well-counselled
defendant
had
now
changed
his
mind
and
wanted
to
withdraw,
how
do
we
factor
that
in?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
--
just
to
be
clear,
isn't
that
after
titlow
had
asked
for
an
attorney
because
titlow
had
talked
with
the
jailer,
who
encouraged
titlow
to
plead
innocent?
so
--
so
you
have
to
include
that
preface
to
this
statement,
or
it's
quite
incomplete.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
correct
me
if
that's
wrong.
