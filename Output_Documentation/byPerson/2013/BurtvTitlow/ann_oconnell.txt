ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
primary
points
that
the
united
states
would
like
to
make.
first,
when
evaluating
strickland
prejudice
in
the
context
of
a
rejected
plea
offer,
the
statement
of
a
convicted
defendant
that
she
would
have
accepted
the
plea
absent
sufficient
advice
should
be
viewed
with
skepticism
and
to
support
a
finding
of
causation,
the
statement
should
be
judged
based
on
all
the
objective
circumstances.
second,
when
a
federal
habeas
court
finds
a
sixth
amendment
violation
in
the
rejected
plea
context,
it
should
not
categorically
require
the
government
to
reoffer
a
rejected
plea
deal.
that
decision
should
be
left
to
the
sentencing
court,
and
requiring
the
government
to
reoffer
a
rejected
plea
deal
in
a
context
like
this
case
where
the
plea
agreement
required
the
defendant
to
do
something
other
than
plead
guilty
--
give
testimony
against
her
aunt
--
it
doesn't
make
sense,
and
the
government
should
not
be
required
to
make
the
reoffer.
every
defendant
who
rejects
a
plea
offer
and
then
is
convicted
after
a
trial
will
have
an
incentive
and
will
want
to
revert
back
to
a
plea
deal
that
she
rejected
beforehand.
the
statement
of
a
convicted
defendant
that
she
would
not
have
withdrawn
her
plea--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
don't
--
we're
not
asking
for
any
kind
of
a
special
rule
that
there
has
to
be,
you
know,
a
certain
amount
of
corroborating
evidence
in
addition
to
the
defendant's
statement.
i
do
think
it
is
just
a
general
rule
that
you
have
to
expand
out
to
all
the
objective
circumstances
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
the
defendant.
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
says
in
this
case
is,
unlike
some
circuits,
this
court
does
not
require
that
a
defendant
must
support
his
own
assertion
that
he
would
have
accepted
the
offer
with
additional
objective
evidence.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
was
saying
that
the
defendant's
statement
should
be
credited
or
not
credited
alone
without
necessarily
looking
at
everything,
that's
wrong.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
--
that
it
looked
to
other
evidence
in
the
record
and
to
corroborating
circumstances,
the
ones
that
it
pointed
to
were
too
weak,
and
they
were
also
very
selective.
the
court
pointed
to
two
things
that
the
court--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--all
we're
asking
the
court
to
announce
or
to
clarify
on
this
question
is
that
the
subjective
statement
or
the
self-serving
statement
of
the
defendant
in
these
circumstances
should
be
viewed
with
skepticism,
and
that
the
court
should
look--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
to
the
--
there
could
be
confusion
on
what
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
is.
i
mean,
there
is
--
the
sixth
circuit
believed
that
it
was
announcing
a
rule
or
that
it
has
a
standard--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--we
are
not
asking
for
any
kind
of
a
special
rule.
we
are
just
asking
that
--
that
the
court
clarify
if
it
addresses
the
second
question,
that
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
saying,
that
you
essentially
--
if
you
interpret
it
to
mean
that
you
don't
have
to
look
out
to
all
the
--
the
objective
circumstances
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
defendant,
that
that's
wrong.
ms.
ann
o'connell
not
in
this
case.
the
--
the
disparity
between
the
sentence
that
a
person
receives
after
the
plea
deal
and
the
sentence
that
they
received
after
a
trial
is
going
to
be
present
in
every
case.
ms.
ann
o'connell
in
fact,
it
has
to
be
for
prejudice.
that
could
be
a
corroborating
circumstance
or
something
to
support
the
defendant's
statement
in
a
case
where,
like
some
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions,
the
defendant
was
misadvised
on
sentencing
exposure.
the
lawyer
said,
well,
you
should
reject
this
plea
deal
for
15
years
because
the
maximum
that
you
could
get
at
trial
is
20
and
so
it's
worth
the
risk.
but
this
defendant
understood
completely
and
said
multiple
times
on
the
record
that
she
understood
that
the
--
the
potential
sentence
for
a
murder
conviction
was
a
life
sentence
and
that
that
was
back
on
the
table
if
she
withdrew
the
plea
offer.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
i
think
the
trial
court
has
a
lot
of
discretion
under
the
court's
opinion,
but
i
think
what
--
what
should
have
happened
in
this
circumstance
is
to
go
back
to
the
sentencing
court,
not
require
the
government
to
reoffer
this
plea
deal,
which
just
simply
can't
be
--
can't
be
offered
and
accepted
anymore.
in
fact,
in
the
record
when
you
see
it
being
reoffered,
they're
saying
we're
offering
manslaughter
in
exchange
for
her
testimony
at
a
trial
that
already
happened.
it
doesn't
make
sense.
in
this
case,
there
--
there
should
be
no
reoffer.
we
should
go
based
on
the
conviction
after
trial
because
of
that,
and
perhaps
there
could
be
some
kind
of
a
reduction
of
the
sentence
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
i
mean,
we
think
that's
right.
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
because
there
is
no
remedy,
that
the
court
shouldn't
address
the
first
or
second
questions.
i
mean,
maybe
if
the
court
thinks
that
there's
--
there's
definitely
no
remedy
and
that
this
20
to
40-year
sentence
should
remain
in
place.
but
--
but,
exactly,
we
don't
think
that
the
--
that
the
government
should
be
required
to
reoffer
the
plea
agreement
in
these
circumstances.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes.
the
problem
--
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
sort
of
took
as
a
given
that
in
circumstances
like
this,
that
the
--
the
original
plea
offer
has
to
be
reoffered.
and
what
we
think
the
court
was
saying
in
lafler
is
that
that's
one
thing
that's
on
the
table.
it's
not
necessarily
required
in
every
case.
there
could
be
other
creative
remedies.
like
there
could
be
a
defendant
who
can
no
longer
--
who
missed
the
opportunity
to
give
the
testimony
she
was
supposed
to
give,
but
perhaps
she
has
information
on
somebody
else
and
so
maybe
we
could
do
a
renegotiation
of
the
plea.
the
sixth
circuit,
we
do
not
think,
should
be
just
requiring
after
it
finds
a
sixth
amendment
violation
that
the
government
reoffer
a
plea
agreement
in
circumstances
that
are
different
from
those
in
lafler.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
and
--
and
we
simply
think
that
the
decision
whether
to
require
the
government
to
reoffer
it
in
the
first
place
should
also
be
something
that's
left
up
to
the
sentencing
court.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes.
so
this
should
all
be
left
to
the
discretion
--
discretion
of
the
sentencing
court
to
come
up
with
an
adequate
remedy.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--the
--
the
court's
opinion
in
lafler,
i
think,
leaves
that
question
open.
it
says
that
it
could
be
the
circumstances
that
the
sentencing
judge
determines
that
the
most
fair
result
is
to
leave
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
in
place,
but
the
sentencing
court
has
that
discretion.
thank
you.
