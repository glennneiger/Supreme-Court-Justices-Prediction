justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
the
sentence
that
was
ultimately
imposed
after
the
trial
for
the
second-degree
murder
conviction
within
the
guidelines,
within
the
michigan
guidelines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
--
do
you
know
what
those
guidelines
were?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
explain
the
procedural
situation
before
the
michigan
court
of
appeals?
there
was
a
motion
by
the
respondent
for
a
remand
to
the
trial
court
to
create
a
record;
is
that
--
that
correct--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--on
the
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
and
so
the
--
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
decide
was
whether
the
materials
that
were
submitted
by
the
respondent
were
sufficient
to
justify
the
hearing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
gather,
said
they're
not
sufficient
and
cited,
among
other
things
or
principally,
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
claimed
innocence,
and
that
was
the
reason
for
the
change
of
attorney.
so
the
issue
really
wasn't
--
that
was
before
them
was
really
not
entitlement
to
relief,
but
in
the
course
of
deciding
whether
there
should
be
a
remand,
they
necessarily
got
to
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
an
entitlement
to
relief.
is
that
--
is
that
correct
or
do
i
not
understand?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
at
the
change
of
plea
hearing,
the
first
attorney
didn't
mention
the
claim
of
innocence,
only
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
sentence
was
above
the
guidelines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
question
of
this
--
of
this
sentence,
what
do
you
think
were
the
range
of
reasonable
sentences
that
could
have
been
imposed
in
compliance
with
our
recent
decisions?
you
have
--
you
have
the
sentence
that
was
offered
before
the
trial,
but
that
was
predicated
on,
a,
testimony,
and
b,
not
having
to
go
to
trial.
and
then
you
have
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
after
the
trial
when
there
was
no
testimony
and
there
was
a
trial.
so
what
was
the
--
what
do
you
think
a
trial
court
could
reasonably
do
in
that
situation,
just
split
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
arguing
that
he
--
he
needed
to
be
--
he
needed
to
have
enough
material
and
to
have
familiarized
himself
enough
with
everything
that's
relevant
to
the
case
to
be
able
to
go
to
trial
before
he
could
move
to
have
the
--
the
previous
plea
withdrawn?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
well,
then
i
don't
understand
what
the
argument
was.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
--
is
it
unreasonable
to
read
the
pierson
affidavit
--
and
--
and
you
submitted
that;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
--to
read
it
to
mean
that
there
were
discussions
between
deputy
ott
and
titlow,
and
titlow
said
she
wasn't
guilty?
ott
said,
"well,
if
you
are
not
guilty,
you
shouldn't
plead
guilty.
"
"i
will
refer
you
to
an
attorney.
"
"if
you
want
me
to,
i
could
ask
somebody
to
come
and
talk
to
me.
"
that
seems
to
be
a
direct
quote
from
--
from
titlow.
isn't
that
--
so
isn't
it
reasonable
to
read
it
that
way?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
was
the
attorney
at
that
stage?
i
take
it,
it
wasn't
the
trial
attorney
because
the
--
a
big
part
of
the
claim
before
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
trial
attorney
was
also
ineffective.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
was
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
she's
--
is
she
with
your
office
or
she's--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
she
was
appointed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
that's
the
case--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--your
arguments
seemed
to
be
--
have
had
a
head-on
collision.
if
this
is
nothing
but
a
manslaughter
case,
then
why
was
--
what
argument
do
you
have
that
toca
was
ineffective
in
saying,
let's
go
to
trial.
so
if
you're
convicted
of
manslaughter
without
the
plea,
you'll
get
your
guidelines
sentence
on
the
manslaughter
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
not
a
manslaughter
case.
i
thought
you
were
just
saying
it's
a
manslaughter
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
my
head--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
have
my
head
spinning.
i
thought
you
were
making
the
argument
that
there's
nothing
unfair
about
requiring
acceptance
of
--
about
the
imposition
of
a
manslaughter
sentence
because
this
was
a
manslaughter
case.
i
thought
you
were
making
that
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
i
misunderstand
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
about
mr.
--
mr.
toca's
ethical
lapses?
are
they
--
do
they
have
a
legal
significance
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
what
sense
is
his
credibility
--
did
his
credibility
figure
in
the
decision
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
submitted
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals?
not
the
--
i
am
not
talking
about
the
exhibits
that
were
attached,
but
there
was
a
motion,
a
brief?
what
was
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
in
the
habeas
record,
it's
not
in
the
record
of
the
federal
court.
and
we've
been
unable
to
get
it
from
the
state
court,
but
it
does
exist?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
motion?
