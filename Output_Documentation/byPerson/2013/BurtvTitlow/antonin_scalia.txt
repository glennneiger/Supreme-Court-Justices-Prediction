well,
that's
true.
but
--
but
you
--
you
have
the
duty,
or
--
or
counsel
for
the
defendant
has
the
duty
to
show
that
counsel
did
not
do
that.
it's
--
it
seems
to
me
you
are
putting
the
burden
on
the
other
side
to
--
to
prove
that
the
--
that
counsel
knew
all
this.
and
that's
not
the
way
--
that's
not
the
way
the
game
is
played.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
it's
so
strange
to
make
the
prosecutor
--
to
make
the
prosecution
submit
an
offer
that
can
no
longer
be
accepted.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
any
more
strange
than
to
make
the
prosecution
submit
an
offer
where
the
situation
was
at
the
beginning.
you
do
this,
and
i
will
--
you
know,
i
will
prosecute.
the
quid
pro
quo
was
you
avoid
the
possibility
of
conviction.
but
here,
she's
already
been
convicted.
she
had
a
trial,
you
know,
by
12
fair,
impartial
jurors,
and
she
was
guilty.
that's
--
that's
what
the
jury
found.
so
it
seems
to
me
just
as
strange
to
make
the
prosecution,
now
that
we
know
she's
guilty,
submit
--
submit
that
prior
offer.
so,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
quite
weird,
in
any
event.
so
one
--
one
incremental
weirdness
is
--
is
not
so
bad.
