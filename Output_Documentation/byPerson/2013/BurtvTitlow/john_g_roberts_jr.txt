chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-414,
burt
vs.
titlow.
mr.
bursch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
need
to
give
us
some
examples
of
things
that
don't
count.
i
thought
it
was
in
your
brief
that
you
had
said,
look,
the
fact
that
it
turns
out
to
have
been
a
very
bad
deal,
you
know,
the
bargain
was
one
year,
and
the
sentence
after
guilty
was
20
years,
that,
i
take
it,
you
say
is
not
a
corroborating
factor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
newman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
could
move
beyond
the
particular
facts
to
some
of
the
broader
points
that
the
solicitor
general
has
raised.
if
you
don't
have
the
requirement
of
at
least
some
corroboration,
then
all
you
have
in
every
case
is
a
completely
self-serving
assertion:
i
wouldn't
have
pled
guilty,
you
know,
if
i
had
known
this
or
i
had
known
that.
and
everybody
will
raise
that
argument.
everybody
raises
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
anyway,
and
they
will
just
add
onto
it
this
plea
assertion.
i
mean,
shouldn't
it
be
--
the
sixth
circuit
really
went
out
of
its
way
saying
there
is
no
requirement
of
corroboration
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
in
what
you
are
characterizing
as
dicta?
you
think
it
was
wrong
to
say
that,
and
that
the
other
circuits
which
require
something
in
addition,
that
that's
the
rule
that
we
should
adopt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
maybe
i'm
misremembering,
but
the
sixth
circuit
distanced
it
itself
from
the
other
circuits,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
you
are
telling
me
that
all
the
circuits
have
always
done
this.
so
the
sixth
circuit
at
least
thinks
it's
doing
something
different?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
there
is
always
going
to
be
objective
evidence,
that's
like
saying
you
don't
have
to
have
corroboration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
when
it
said,
we
are
doing
something
different
than
the
other
circuits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bursch,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
