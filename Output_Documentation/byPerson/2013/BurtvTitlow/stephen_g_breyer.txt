justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
clarify
something
for
me
about
habeas
corpus
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
to
imagine
facts,
so
let's
take
it
as
a
hypothetical.
the
u.s.
--
the
district
attorney
says:
this
lawyer
was
adequate
and
really
two
factors
make
that
obvious.
the
first
factor
is
that
the
client
said
that
she
was
innocent
and,
taking
that
into
account
with
the
other
things,
that
could
have
justified
adequately
his
withdrawal
of
the
plea
and
not
convincing
her
not
to.
second,
the
sentence
that
the
district
attorney
wanted
to
give
was
more
than
a
year
greater
than
the
guidelines
for
manslaughter,
and
that
could
have
justified
it.
now,
it
writes
--
the
court
then
writes
in
its
opinion
only
the
second
reason
and
never
mentions
the
first.
now
we
go
to
habeas
and
the
habeas
court
thinks
that
second
reason
is
pretty
flimsy
there.
gee,
she
was
exposing
herself
to
murder,
et
cetera;
it's
pretty
flimsy.
the
first
isn't
so
bad,
but
they
didn't
rely
on
it.
okay.
so
now
what's
the
habeas
court
supposed
to
do?
should
the
defendant
have
gone
back
to
the
state
court
first?
is
the
habeas
court
supposed
to
have
its
own
independent
hearing
and
make
up
its
own
mind?
how
does
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
glad.
i
would
love
to
have
an
answer.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
are
there
rules
in
this
area?
i
didn't
think
--
are
there
rules?
i
mean,
doesn't
every
judge,
whenever
that
judge
is
deciding
a
factual
matter
or
the
jury,
take
into
account
from
every
witness,
whether
that
witness
is
making
a
pretty
self-serving
statement?
i
mean,
that's
a
factor.
and
i
guess
we
could
have
some
situations,
sometime,
in
some
place,
where
a
witness
got
on
the
stand
and
said
something
that
was
totally
in
his
favor,
but
when
you
heard
it,
hmm,
and
you
knew
the
case,
hmm,
he's
right.
and
then
that
could
happen
with
this
kind
of
witness,
too.
it
could
happen.
i'm
not
saying
it
very
often
does,
but
it
could.
so
why
should
we
have
any
special
rule
for
these
witnesses
and
not
for
any
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
evidence.
you
--
you
are
saying
that
the
court
was
wrong
when
they
said
your
client
said
she
wasn't
guilty.
now,
this
affidavit
doesn't
show
that.
i
mean,
paragraph
6
doesn't
say
who
spoke
first,
but
common
sense
suggests
that
the
deputy
sheriff
wouldn't
have
made
that
statement
unless
she
spoke
first.
i
mean,
does
he
go
around
saying
to
everybody
just
generally,
oh,
you
know,
if
you
are
not
guilty,
you
shouldn't
plead
guilty
"i
mean,
it
says
they
had
discussions
and
during
discussions
he
told
her
she
shouldn't
plead
guilty
if
she
wasn't
guilty.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
--
approached
her--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
discussions
with
her.
it
doesn't
say
why
he
approached
her.
i
mean,
i
just
don't
think
people
normally
do
that,
they
go
to
every
person
in
jail
and
say:
you
know,
if
you
are
not
guilty,
you
shouldn't
plead
guilty.
i
mean,
somebody
might,
but
something
triggered
that
advice,
and
the
affidavit
doesn't
tell
me
what
triggered
that
advice.
so
i
could
infer
that
what
triggered
the
advice
was
her
statement
she
was
not
guilty,
or
i
could
infer
this
is
an
unusual
situation
where,
for
some
reason
unknown,
he
brought
it
up.
i
don't
know
from
reading
paragraph
6.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
whose
burden
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
matter.
why
doesn't
it
matter?
because
if
she
went,
he
--
she
said,
you
know,
i'm
not
really
guilty,
he
said,
well,
you
shouldn't
plead
guilty,
she
said
--
but
i
have
a
lawyer
that
will
get
rid
of
your
guilty
plea.
if
it
went
something
like
that,
and
then
we
assume
the
lawyer
was
told
about
this
--
it
doesn't
say,
but
that's
a
reasonable
assumption.
and
then
the
court
opinion
of
michigan
seems
to
make
sense
that
that
was
a
reason,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
made
his
conduct
in
--
in
withdrawing
the
plea
or,
you
know,
not
strongly
advising
her
against
it.
that
was
one
reason
why
that
wasn't
an
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel.
now
where
have
i
made
my
mistake
in
this
chain?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
were
--
there
is
a
reason
that
they
spoke
about,
which
was,
well,
she
said
she
was
innocent.
now,
as
to
that
one,
what
they
wrote
is
the
record
discloses
that
the
second
attorney's
advice
was
set
in
motion
by
defendant's
statement
to
the
sheriff's
deputy
that
he
did
not
commit
the
offense.
now,
you
say
that's
just
contrary
to
fact
as
you
point
to
the
affidavit.
and
the
affidavit
i
read,
i
think
it's
a
little
--
rather
ambiguous
in
that
respect,
and
i
can
overturn
that
or
a
federal
court
can
only
if
this
factual
statement
i
just
read
you
is
clearly
wrong,
clearly.
so
i
have
a
tough
time
saying
it's
clearly.
and
i
know
they
overstated,
because
they
said
automatically,
in
this
case.
well,
that
may
be
an
overstatement.
you
have
to
read
it
in
light
of
that
sentence.
but
then
you're
making
a
second
argument,
i
take
it,
if
this
is
right.
your
second
argument
is,
anyway,
he
was
incompetent
for
a
completely
different
reason.
he
didn't
read
the
record.
and
if
he'd
read
it,
he
never
would
have
made
the
statement
that
this
is
just
a
manslaughter
case.
he
would
have
seen
that
if
she
withdrew
her
guilty
plea
she'd
be
tried
for
murder,
and
then
she'd
get
a
really
long
sentence.
so
that's
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
now,
what
does
the
court
in
michigan
say
about
that?
nothing.
so
now
i
wonder.
maybe
nobody
made
that
argument
to
them.
or,
maybe
they
made
it
and
they
rejected
it
sub
silentio.
that's
why
i
asked
my
first
question.
okay?
so
--
and
you
heard
the
response.
even
if
they
had
heard
that
argument
and
they
said
nothing
about
it,
they
don't
have
to
--
they
don't
have
to
mention
every
argument
made.
if
they
just
deny,
we
assume
they
deny
it,
and
what
we
do
is
see
whether
they
were
within
their
rights
to
deny
it.
that's
how
we
are
supposed
to
look
at
it:
does
it
clearly
violate
supreme
court
law
to
deny
it?
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
factual
part
of
that
and
a
legal
part.
all
right,
how
do
we
deal
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first
of
all,
did
anybody
make
the
argument
as
clearly
as
you
have
made
it?
i
saw
what
it
was,
i
think.
so,
that's
--
did
anybody
make
that
argument
to
the
michigan
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
okay.
well,
that's
the
end
of
that,
isn't
it?
what
you
are
coming
for
is
you
have
to
proceed
by
asking
for
reopening
in
the
michigan
court
and
see
if
they
say
it's
too
late.
and
then,
you
know,
et
cetera,
they're
all
spelled
out
in
this
opinion
which
i
can't
remember,
cullen
or
pinholster
or
something.
and
this
isn't
an
argument
for
us
now.
