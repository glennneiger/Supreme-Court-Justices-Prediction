ms.
valerie
r.
newman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
question
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
erred
and
created
an
end-run
around
strickland
in
finding
the
professed
--
that
if
a
defendant
professes
innocence,
that
there's
no
need
to
look
any
further
to
say
that
defense
counsel
provided
effective
assistance.
there
is
also--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--that
is
partially
true,
justice
sotomayor.
the
record
does
show
that
at
every
turn
when
mr.
toca
stepped
into
the
courtroom
he
asked
for
more
time
and
indicated
he
wasn't
ready.
the
record
does
show
that,
as
soon
as
the
plea
was
withdrawn,
mr.
toca
said:
"i
need
more
time.
"
"i'm
not
ready
to
go
to
trial.
"
"and
in
all
fairness,
my
--
my
client
deserves
to
have
a
fair
trial.
"
"i'm
not
ready.
"
he's
not
ready
to
go
to
trial.
he
doesn't
have
a
good
handle
on
what
the
record
is.
my
brother
counsel
makes
an
argument
that
mr.
toca
made
a
very
sophisticated
sentencing
analysis
and
therefore
had
a
grasp
of
the
record.
i
would
disagree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
record.
mr.
toca
came
in
and
said
that
the
guidelines
were
two
to
five
on
the
minimum
sentence.
the
prosecutor
said:
"i
don't
know
what
the
guidelines
are
and
i
don't
care.
"
there's
--
we
don't
even
know
if
his
recitation
of
what
the
guidelines
range
was,
was
accurate.
so
there
is
nothing
on
this
record
to
show
that
mr.
toca
even
knew
anything
about
the--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--no,
my
argument
does
not
go
that
far.
what
i'm
arguing--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--the
argument
is
that
defense
counsel
has
a
duty
to
investigate,
that
the
defense
attorney
has
a
duty
to
be
able
to
inform
the
client
of
the
risks
of
either
accepting
a
plea,
withdrawing
a
plea,
whatever
the
case.
in
this
case
it's
withdrawing
a
plea
that
has
already
been
accepted
by
the
court.
this
is
a
very
significant
step
in
this
matter.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
and
we
are
not
putting
the
burden
on
the
other
side.
there
is
--
i
will
refer
the
court
to
the
pierson
affidavit,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
298.
that
affidavit,
in
particular,
paragraphs
6,
7,
and
8,
indicates
that
in
an
arbitration
hearing
when
ms.
titlow
testified
and
mr.
ott
or
deputy,
sheriff's
deputy
ott
testified
--
in
arbitration
hearings,
witnesses
are
put
under
oath
and
the
affidavit
is
a
sworn
affidavit
from
an
attorney.
so
it
is
a
notarized
affidavit
from
--
about
testimony
that
was
taken
under
oath,
that
indicates
that
mr.
toca
approached
ms.
titlow
while
she
was
in
jail,
while
she
was
represented
by
counsel;
that
the
approach
was:
"you
should
reject
the
plea
and
not
testify
against
your
aunt.
"
that's
the
evidence
that
we
have
in
the
record,
and
that
is
not
just
ms.
titlow.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
justice
kennedy--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
would
say
that's
wrong,
and
that's
where
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
again
and
why
the
state
court's
findings
are
entitled
to
no
deference,
because
the
state
court
took
that
affidavit
from
william
pierson
and
turned
the
words
on
its
head.
the
affidavit
does
not
state
that
vonlee
titlow
approached
the
sheriff's
deputy
and
asked
for
a
new
attorney.
the
affidavit
states
that
the
sheriff's
deputy
approached
her.
he
told
her
she
should
consult
with
his
attorney
because
his
attorney
was
really
good
and
his
attorney
would
be
able
to
help
her.
and
so
it's
the
sheriff's
deputy,
unequivocally
from
this
affidavit,
because
it's
the
only
place
that
this
evidence
comes
from,
it's
the
sheriff's
deputy--
i'm
sorry.
were
you
looking
--
it's
on
page
298
of
the
joint
appendix
in
william
pierson's
affidavit.
it's
the
sheriff's
deputy
that
sets
everything
in
motion
about
innocence.
and
why
does
he
do
that?
because
he's
in
the
courtroom
when
the
plea
is
entered.
and
what
is
part
of
the
plea?
part
of
the
plea
is
that
vonlee
titlow
passed
a
polygraph.
well,
to
a
layperson
what
does
that
mean?
you
pass
a
polygraph,
you
are
innocent,
you
didn't
do
the
crime.
well,
in
this
case,
that's
not
the
situation
at
all.
the
passing
of
the
polygraph
cemented
her
guilt
in
participating
in
this
crime.
but
what
the
--
what
she
passed
in
the
polygraph
was
that
she
was
an
aider
and
abettor.
so
it
was
her
aunt
who
took
the
pillow
and
smothered
her
uncle,
not
ms.
titlow.
but
she
was
present.
she
participated.
she
accepted
money
after
the
crime.
so
everything
that
happened
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
took
the
actual
facts
and
turned
them
on
its
head,
which
is
why
the
factual
findings
are
not
entitled
to
deference.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
justice
alito,
that's
one
--
part
of
what
you
said
i
would
agree
with,
that
the
--
it
does
state
in
the
affidavit,
certainly,
that
he
had
an
attorney
that
was
really
good
and
could
ask
somebody
to
come
talk
to
me.
but
the
rest
of
the
statements,
i
would
argue,
are
--
are
inferences
and
not
facts.
and
we
have
facts
in
the
affidavit.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
it
also
--
it
also
says,
with
all
due
respect,
that--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--the
deputy
approached
her.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
right.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
and
justice
breyer--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--justice
breyer,
i
would
argue
that
it's
--
it's
an
inference
that
doesn't
matter.
it's
an--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--in
this
case.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
in
paragraph
8
of
william
pierson's
affidavit
on
page
298
it
indicates
that
it
was
frederick
toca
who
encouraged
her
to
reject
a
plea
agreement
to
testify
against
the
aunt.
so
again
we
have
the
attorney,
who
is
not
ms.
titlow,
who
is
saying:
i
want
to
withdraw
my
plea.
it's
the
attorney
who
is
saying
to
her
and
encouraging
her
to
reject
the
plea.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i
was
not
the
attorney.
i
came
into
the
case
at
this
level.
so
i
did
not
do
any
of
the
litigation
below.
however,
there
are
--
there
is
record
evidence
to
support,
not
--
there
is
record
evidence
that
supports
the
claim
and
maybe
was
a
strategic
decision
by
the
attorney
not
to
submit
other
affidavits
because
the
attorney
was
simply
looking
for
a
hearing
to
expand
the
record.
so
we
have--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--they
--
michigan
--
michigan
--
the
way
michigan
works
is
within
56
days
of
getting
the
transcripts,
you
can
file
in
the
trial
court.
if
you
--
if
you
fail
to
make
that
56-day
deadline,
then
your
alternative
is
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
for
a
remand.
so
we
don't
know
when
the
case
got
to
the
attorney.
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
within
that
very
short
time
period,
there
was
no
motion
filed
in
the
trial
court.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
right.
it
was--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--it
was
an
appellate
attorney,
liz
jacobs,
was
the
attorney
at
that
stage.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
she's
not
with
my
office,
no.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
she
was
--
i
don't
know
if
she
was
appointed
or
retained,
but
she's
not
with
my
office.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
justice
ginsburg
--
ginsburg,
as
the
court
decided
last
term
in
lafler
v.
cooper,
the
point
of
the
remedy
is
to
put
the
defendant
as
closely
as
possible
back
in
the
position
he
or
she
would
have
been
in
but
for
the
ineffective
assistance.
in
lafler
v.
cooper,
the
court
recognized
that
there's
going
to
be
situations
where
circumstances
have
changed,
and
there's
going
to
be
circumstances
where
that
is
not
possible
to
--
to
do
that
exactly.
in
this
case,
of
course,
she
cannot
testify
against
her
aunt
because
her
aunt
was
acquitted
and
is
deceased;
however--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
it
is
an
offer
that
can
be
made
if
you
remove
the
condition
precedent.
so
the
offer
--
the
--
the
premise
of
the
offer
is
a
charge
reduction.
from
first-degree--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
again,
referring
to
lafler
v.
cooper,
the
remedy
goes
--
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches
to
the
defendant,
not
to
the
prosecution.
so
the
goal
here
is
to
remedy,
if
the
court
finds
and
agrees
that
there's
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
to
remedy
that
sixth
amendment
violation.
if
there
is
an
unequal
burden
to
be
borne
by
one
--
one
side
or
the
other,
it
has
to
be
borne
by
the
government.
and
so
therefore,
the
way
to
remedy
the
sixth
amendment
violation,
it
was
a
charge
reduction,
is
to
reoffer
the
manslaughter
plea,
which
has
already
been
done
in
this
case,
by
the
way.
my
client
has
already
accepted
that
plea.
and
then
it's
up
to
the
trial
court
now
whether
or
not
to
accept
the
plea,
reject
the
plea,
or
do
some
sort
of
modification,
which
is
exactly
what
the
sixth
circuit
ordered
and
is
exactly
what
this
court
ordered
in
--
in
lafler
v.
cooper,
to
allow
the
trial
court
to
have
the
discretion
in
fashioning
a
remedy
that
both
will
take
care
of
the
sixth
amendment
violation
and
can
balance
the
concerns
of
the
prosecution
in
what's
been
lost
in
that
process,
but
still
be
able
to
craft
a
remedy.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
justice
scalia,
though,
i
think
you
hit
the
point
on
the
head.
she
--
she
was
always
guilty.
and
as
my
brother
counsel
stated,
this
case,
in
some
ways,
is
very,
very
similar
to
cooper.
you
have
comments
on
the
record
by
frederick
toca
that
the
prosecution
is
--
has
made
comments
and
--
and
they
reference
this
in
the
appendix,
they
reference
a
newspaper
article,
the
prosecutor
talking
about
the
fact
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
manslaughter
case.
this
is
--
we're
charging
first-degree
murder,
but
really,
it's
sort
of
a
--
in
sheep's
clothing,
it's
really
just
manslaughter.
and
frederick
toca
is
saying
on
the
record,
this
is
just
a
manslaughter
case.
why
should
my
client
accept
an
above-guideline
sentence
of
a
seven-year
minimum
and
have
to
testify
against
a
codefendant.
she's
going
to
go
to
trial,
and
the
prosecutor's
already
admitted
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
manslaughter
case,
so
she'll
be
convicted
of
manslaughter,
and
she's
going
to
be
in
a
better
position
following
trial
and
conviction,
just
like
in
cooper.
there
was
no
question
mr.
cooper
was
going
to
be
convicted.
there
was
no
question
at
all.
defense
counsel
gave
the
same
advice.
you
can't
be
convicted
of
the
charged
offense.
you're
going
to
be
convicted
of
a
lesser
sentence,
and
following
that
conviction,
you
will
be
in
a
better
position
for
sentencing
than
you
will
be
with
this
plea.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
the
facts
are
in
all
force.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
because
it's
for
the
same
reason
in
cooper.
he
was
absolutely
wrong,
and
he
was
not
aware
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
marshalled
against
ms.
titlow,
including
their
own
confessions.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i'm
saying
that
his
representations
on
the
record
are
similar
to
the
representations
made
by
mr.
cooper's
attorney
on
the
record.
that
you
would
--
in
response
to
justice--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--she
was
convicted
of
second-degree
murder.
and
in
this
case
--
in
cooper,
the
defense
attorney
never
filed
a
motion
to
quash.
so
he
never
challenged
the
efficient
--
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
in
this
case,
attorney
number
one,
mr.
lustig,
did
file
a
motion
to
quash.
she
tested
the
sufficiency,
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
prosecution's
case
for
first-degree
murder.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
so
there's
no
question--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i'm
not
making
that--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i'm
not
making
that
argument.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
2254
gives
--
has
separate
provisions
for
the
legal
aspect
of
that.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
it's
just
a
factual
argument
trying
to
respond
to
the
court's
questions
about
what
happened
in
this
case
and
about
what
is
contained
in
the
record
and
what
mr.
toca
did
say
on
the
record.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
question
the
sixth
circuit
in
dicta
said
that
we
don't
require
it,
but
it
exists
in
this
case.
and
the
reality
is,
as
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
that
every
circuit
looks
--
it's
a
strickland
analysis.
just
like
every
other
strickland
analysis,
the
court
looks
at
the
entire
record
and
makes
a
determination
based
on
the
record.
and
this
court
has
always
eschewed
hard,
fast,
bright-line
rules
in
terms
of
telling
courts
what
has
to
exist
in
order
to
make
a
specific
finding.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i
don't
think
--
no,
i
don't
think
that
any
particular
rule
should
be
adopted.
i
think
the
rules
that
exist
under
strickland
are
fine
for
the
circuits.
the
rules
have
existed
for
decades
and
the
circuits
have
no
trouble
figuring
out
when
the
threshold
is
met
and
when
it's
not.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes,
it
did
distance
itself
by
stating--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--it
may
think
it
is
doing
something
different,
but
in
this
particular
case
there
was
objective
evidence
that
they
pointed
to
and,
as
the
solicitor
general
mentioned,
there's
always
going
to
be
sentencing
disparity
because
you're
going
to
have
to
have
a
sentencing
disparity
in
order
to
show
prejudice.
so
in
effect
there
will
always
be
objective
evidence
that
will
support
any
subjective
statement
of
a
criminal
defendant
or
you're
never
going
to
see
a--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
for
this
court
--
my
point
is
obviously
the
court
can
--
can
set
forth
a
rule,
but
in
doing
so
i
think
we
are
going
to
run
into
what
justice
sotomayor
said
earlier
in
terms
of
judges
do
this
all
the
time,
they
--
they
figure
out
who's
credible.
i
mean,
it's
never
just
like
here's
these
things,
but
this
guy's
credible
so
i'm
going
to
believe
him.
it's
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
it's
always
going
to
have
to
be
a
totality
of
the
circumstances.
so
to
say,
here's
the
line,
there
has
to
be
objective
evidence,
then
what
is
the
objective
evidence?
how
are
you
going
to
define
objective
evidence?
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
they
certainly
did
not
do
anything
different
in
this
case.
in
the
other
cases
that
i
have
reviewed
from
the
sixth
circuit,
i
have
not
seen
a
case
that
relied
only
on
subjective
testimony.
so
i
can't
point
to
a
case
where
the
sixth
circuit
is
doing
something
different
than
any
other
case,
and
i
don't
believe
anyone
else
has
pointed
to
a
particular
case.
so
they
might
think
they
are
doing
something
different,
but
in
reality
they
are
doing
the
same
thing
as
everybody
else.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
they
certainly
speak
to
his
credibility.
united
states
v.
soto-lopez,
is
a
very
similar
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
where
the
court
did
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
attorney
had
significant
problems,
ethical
problems.
and
in
this
case
mr.
toca's
actions
and
his
ethical
problems
go
hand
in
hand.
i
mean,
he
approached
a
represented
defendant
who
was
in
jail
and
encouraged
her
to
reject
a
plea.
he
did
this
on
a
very
short
timeline,
admitting
that
--
well,
not
admitting,
but
we
know
from
prior
counsel
that
he
had
not
even
picked
up
the
phone
to
speak
with
prior
counsel,
who
had
spent
almost
a
year
litigating
this
case.
he
had
not
retrieved
prior
counsel's
file.
it
appears
from
the
record
--
those
are
facts.
in
terms
of
inferences,
it
appears
from
the
record
that
he
got
his
information
from
the
media.
this
was
a
highly,
highly
publicized
case.
he
signed
a
retainer
agreement
with
a
client
who
had
no
money,
who
gave
him
some
jewelry
and
the
right
to
promote
her
story.
so
he
had
every
--
he
violated
multiple
ethical
rules,
and
those
violations
lead
to
the
conclusion,
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
the
reason
for
withdrawing
the
plea
was
to
make
the
deal
more
lucrative.
it
is
not
lucrative
if
she
pleads.
she
had
already
pled,
so
she
had
already
entered
a
plea
and
all
that
was
left
was
sentencing.
that's
not
a
very
exciting
story
if
your
entire
retainer
agreement
relies
on
the
fact
that
you
have
the
media
rights
to
sell
this
story.
so
yes,
i
would
argue
that
the
ethical
lapses
are
very
significant
in
this
case
and
lend
credibility
to--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
it
didn't.
there
were
separate
issues
raised
on
ethical
violations,
and
they
were
denied
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
they
were
denied
by
the
federal
court.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
they
were
specifically
presented
with
the
conflict
argument
and
off
the
top
of
my
head,
i
apologize,
i
don't
recall
if
that
is
specifically
contained
in
there,
but
i
think
it
was.
i
mean,
it
was
definitely
briefed
and
argued,
the
ethical
violations.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
disbarred.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes.
he
committed
multiple
misdemeanors
and
a
felony
and
in
part
was
disbarred
based
on
this
conduct
in
this
case.
so
he
is
no
longer
practicing
law.
last
i
checked,
he
is
no
longer
practicing
law
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes,
in
michigan
it's
called
a
motion
to
remand.
you
are
required
under
the
court
rules
to
submit
a
brief
in
support
of
that
motion
to
remand
and
you
are
required
to
submit
a
proffer.
so
the
proffer--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--yes.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
absolutely,
yes.
you
have
to
file
a
motion
to
remand
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
references
that
motion
to
remand
and
the
proffer
by
the
affidavit
in
stating
that
normally
they
wouldn't
consider
those,
that
proffer
as
substantive
of
evidence,
but
in
this
case
inexplicably,
they
did,
which
leads
to
another
reason
why
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
decision
is
unreasonable.
because
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
failed
to
engage
in
further
fact
finding.
so
we
take
the
record
as
we
get
it
from
them
and
under
williams
and
other
decisions,
if
the
court
is
the
one
responsible
for
an
inadequate
record,
and
we
would
have
what
we
have,
and
i
would
argue
to
this
court
that
the
record
that
we
had
supports
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
erred
both
legally
and
factually
in
its
findings
and
therefore
neither
are
entitled
to
any
deference.
and
the
sixth
circuit
habeas
should
be
affirmed
in
this
matter.
thank
you.
