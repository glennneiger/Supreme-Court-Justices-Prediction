justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
years
ago,
one
of
my
colleagues,
not
on
this
bench,
but
a
different
one,
said
to
me,
you
know,
there's
much
to-do
about
judges
basing
credibility
on
demeanor.
and
he
said,
no
one
does
that.
what
you
base
it
on
is
the
internal
consistency
and
logic
of
the
testimony
and
how
it's
corroborated
by
circumstances.
and
he
said,
otherwise,
you
just
rarely
hear
anybody
say,
story
makes
sense,
nothing
--
story
doesn't
make
sense,
the
story's
not
corroborated,
but
the
guy
looks
like
he's
telling
the
truth.
i'm
reading
all
the
decisions
that
you
cited
for
me
and
not
one,
including
in
this
circuit,
relies
simply
on
that
kind
of
statement.
every
one
of
them
is
based
on
comparing
the
testimony
to
other
factors;
to
logic,
to
evidence,
to
objectives.
so
i
don't
know
what
rule
it
is,
what
objective
evidence
means.
do
you
mean
corroboration
the
way
you
need
to
prove
a
murder?
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
announce?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
said
it,
but
it
didn't
do
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
counselor,
that's
what
juries
do
all
the
time,
selectivity.
that
doesn't
move
me.
what
i
want
to
know
is:
why
do
we
announce
a
rule
that
somehow
suggests
a
limitation
that
can't
exist?
meaning
what
judges
look
to,
to
determine
credibility
relies
on
factors
that
you
can't
sum
up
in
one
word.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
every
court
says
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
that
--
i
mean,
the
court
didn't
say
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
below
--
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
say
that
the
court
below
had
to
accept
the
reoffered
plea
agreement.
it
seemed
inherent
in
lafler
and
frye
that
what
the
court
was
saying
is
that
the
court
below
has
to
use
its
judgment
on
whether
offer
--
accepting
the
plea
is
--
is
right
or
giving
another
remedy
is
right.
all
of
these
arguments
should
be
before
that
court,
not
before
us,
as
an
absolute
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
your
only
point,
which
is
that
that
should
be
an
issue
for
the
court
below.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
some
remedy
has
to
be
offered--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
there
is
a
violation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
agree
with
you
and
so
does
your
adversary,
but
he
says
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
what
research
was
done
or
not
done.
the
fact
that
the
prior
counsel's
record
wasn't
reviewed
doesn't
say
that
he
didn't
talk
to
the
prosecutor,
doesn't
say
that
he
didn't
look
into
other
record
evidence,
any
of
the
discovery
that
had
been
filed
with
the
court,
or
any
of
the
other
circumstances
that
could
have
informed
him
adequately.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--ms.
newman,
you
know,
i
--
i'm
--
this
may
be
the
first
case
that
i
have
been
involved
in
as
a
judge
--
and
there
might
be
others,
but
myself
personally
--
where,
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
defendant
has
not
put
in
an
affidavit
to
explain
what
happened.
there
is
some
force
to
your
adversary's
argument
that
there's
a
really
sparse
record
here.
and
aedpa
deference
requires
the
burden
on
you.
you
can't
deny
that.
i
guess
--
i
don't
know
if
you
were
responsible,
but
what
other
circumstances
that
would
occasion
a
defendant
not
saying,
this
is
what
i
was
told?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
didn't
ask
for
the
hearing
in
the
court
below.
they
only
asked
for
it
at
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
--
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
the
other
side
says,
and
i
think
it's
the
standard,
that
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
you're
saying
is
they
didn't
do
that
here.
it's
not
that
--
they
use
some
objective
evidence,
you're
saying
they
didn't
use
other
objective
evidence.
i
am--
