justice
elena
kagan
in
just
thinking
about
that
michigan
court
of
appeals
decision,
there
is
one
sort
of
troubling
line
in
it
to
me.
it
says:
"when
a
defendant
proclaims
his
innocence,
it
is
not
objectively
unreasonable
to
recommend
that
the
defendant
refrain
from
pleading
guilty
no
matter
how
good
the
deal
may
appear.
"
and
one
way
to
read
this
is
it's
a
kind
of
categorical
rule
which
says
that
when
the
defendant
says
he
is
innocent,
basically
your
obligations
to
properly
advise
him
about
a
plea
go
away.
now,
i
understand
you
not
to
read
it
that
way.
justice
elena
kagan
so
could
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
what
you
think
of
that
question
and
why
you
read
the
sentence
the
way
you
read
the
sentence?
justice
elena
kagan
but
we're
in
a
position
now,
aren't
we,
where
the
state
court
can
do
exactly
that,
can
say
the
circumstances
have
changed,
and
--
and
so
leave
everything
undisturbed.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
know
if
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
ever
presented
with
this
argument
that,
in
fact,
he
gave
the
advice
that
he
did
because
of
the
peculiar
fee
arrangement
that
he
had?
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
toca
is
now,
remind
me,
disbarred
for?
justice
elena
kagan
forever?
