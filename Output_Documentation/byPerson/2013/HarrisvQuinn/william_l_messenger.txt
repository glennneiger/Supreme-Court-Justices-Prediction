mr.
william
l.
messenger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
illinois
is
forcing
susan
watts
and
thousands
of
other
home
care
providers
to
pay
compulsory
fees
to
the
seiu
to
petition
the
state
about
its
medicaid
program
that
pays
for
their
services
to
persons
with
disabilities.
in
mrs.
watts'
case,
her
daughter
libby.
this
violates
the
first
amendment
because
the
purpose
of
this
mandatory
association
is
inherently
expressive.
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances,
otherwise,
lobby.
and
also
because
this
program--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--the
subjects
of
bargaining
here
are
the
reimbursement
rates
given
to
the
providers
and
the
state
now
offers
or
pays
money
to
the
seiu
for
a
health
benefit.
but
that
is
petitioning
the
government
with
regard
to
those
negotiations.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
when
--
in
the
public
sector
when
a
group
is
petitioning
the
government
for
money,
that
is,
petitioning
the
government
over
a
public
program,
here
from
a
medicaid
program.
it
would
be
very
little
different
than
if
the
american
medical
association
was
asking
for
higher
medicaid
rates
for
doctors
or
for
nurses.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
that
is
our
position
for
why
abood
is
distinguishable
on
that
point,
is
that
here
the
state
is
not
the
common
law
employer
or
the
sole
employer
of
these
providers.
it
simply
pays
them
for
their
services,
much
like
a
health
insurer
pays
for
the
services
of
medical
professionals.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
and
that
the
--
the
actual
bargaining,
even
on
behalf
of
true
employees,
is
also
petitioning
and
political
in
nature,
and
for
that
reason
abood
should
be
overruled.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
would
the
union
attempt
to?
mr.
william
l.
messenger
well,
one
thing
that
has
happened,
this
is
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
the
state
has
agreed
to
give
certain
amounts
of
money
to
an
seiu
healthcare
fund
to
offer
access
to
health
benefits
for
those
providers.
so
the
state
is
funding
the
seiu's
health
benefit
program
to
that
extent.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no,
because
in
that
--
with
an
individual
speaking,
it's,
sir,
a
matter
of
private
or
internal
proprietary
matter
that
under
this
court's
precedence
don't
rise
to
a
matter
of
public
concern.
however,
if
you
had
an
organization
petitioning
a
--
a
police
district
for
wages
across
the
board
for
police
officers,
then
that
is
a
matter
of
public
concern
and
would
violate
the
first--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--the
line
would
be
once
you
have
the
collective,
it
would
be
start
to
become
a
matter
of
public
concern.
it'd
be
the
public
concern
test.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
and
if
it
is,
then
i
submit
that
it's
unconstitutional
for--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no.
the
police
just
--
chief
can
certainly
shut
his
door,
but
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
force--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--but
in
that
case
under
our
public
concern
test,
which
goes
within
the
pickering
line,
that
that
individual
grievance
would
not
rise
to
a
first
amendment
petition.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
but
the--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
two
points.
the
first
is
the
scale
is
what
differentiates.
so
here
you
have
a
union
petitioning
a
state
for
medicaid
rates
that
are
paid
for
20,000-some
care
providers.
and
so
the
scale
of
it
is
what
makes
it
a
matter
of
public
concern
or
a
matter
of
lobby
as
opposed
to--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
i'd
say--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--there's
two
differences.
one,
again,
is
the
scale.
when
you're
talking
about
a
union
collectively
petitioning
a
school
district
or
in
the
states--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes,
it's
an
individual
employee
being
forced
to
support
that
expressive
activity.
so
the
question
becomes:
what
expressive
activity
are
they
being
forced
to
support?
and
when
you're
speaking
of
changing
an
entire
government
program,
for
example,
medicaid
rates
across
the
board,
that
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
that
is
a
matter
of
lobbying
or
political--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--but,
again,
under
this
court's
private
--
under
the
public
concern
test,
an
individual
simply
speaking
to
that
usually
does
not
rise
to
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no,
they're
not.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
exactly,
that
they
are
being
forced
to
support
an
organization,
here
the
seiu,
to
speak
or
petition
the
state
over
its
medicaid
rates.
so
the
distinction
is--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes,
under
--
i'm
sorry.
there
is
--
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
problem
with
that
because
my
whole--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes.
under
knight
the
state
can
choose
who
it
bargains
with
and
if
it
chooses
to
set
different
rates
for
union
and
--
union
and
non-union,
it
could,
as
you
said,
notwithstanding
fair
--
or
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
forcing
the
individuals
to
support
the
union
for
the
purpose
of
petitioning
the
state
over
here
the
medicaid
rates
for
homecare.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
there
may
be
statutory.
i
know
that
most
medicaid
programs
are
--
across
the
board
set
rates.
but
also,
constitutionally,
if
there
was
a
differential
act
or
degree,
it
could
be
considered
a
penalty
for
the
individual
exercising
their
rights.
but
as
far
as
i
know,
most
medicaid
programs,
in
particular
the
one
here,
it's
always
been
a
fixed
rate
established
across
the
board.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
it's
the
expression
they're
being
forced
to
support,
your
honor.
so
the
violation,
as
you
say,
is
they're
being
forced
to
support
expressive
activity
and
that
expressive
activity--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes,
your
honor.
they're
not
being
denied
the
right
to
petition
in
the
sense
that
the
state
is
saying
they
cannot
petition.
instead,
they're
being
forced
to
support
petitioning.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
the
way
in
which
homecare
providers
petition
the
state,
i
submit,
is
not
an
internal
proprietary
matter
that
the
government
has
free
rein
to
manage.
and
so
the
distinction
between
government
acting
as
proprietor,
as
you
say,
the
government
can
tell
an
employee
on
work
time
that
you
can't
engage
in
certain
speech
if
it
interferes
with
the
workplace.
but
the
way
in
which
an
individual
associates
with
to
lobby
or
petition
the
state
is
not
an
internal
proprietary
matter.
so
for
example,
here
the
way
in
which
susan
watts
and
other
homecare
providers
petition
the
state
is
not
internal
workplace
speech.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
because
when
the
government
is
involved
the
first
amendment
interests
are
much
heightened
because
you're
dealing
with
attempting
to
influence
government
policy.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
it's
not
considerable
enough.
here
the
state
lacks--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no,
there
isn't,
your
honor.
however,
i
submit
that
it's
not--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--it's
--
your
honor,
it's
the
compelled
speech,
and
the
fact
that
the
individuals
have
other
first
amendment
rights
is
not
exculpatory.
so
it's
the
--
it's
the
compulsion
to
support
the
seiu's
positions
in
petitioning
the
state.
that
is
the
first
amendment
violation.
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
and
actually,
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
providers
do
remain
free
to
petition
the
state
only
shows
that
the
so-called
‶
labor
peace
″
interest
hasn't
been
done
here
by
illinois,
because
the
interest
there
is
to
avoid
competing
demands
from
various
providers.
here,
the
fact
that
each
provider
does,
in
fact,
remain
free
to
petition
the
state
through
organizations
other
than
the
seiu
shows
that
the
state
has
not
achieved
any
sort
of
labor
peace,
as
the
state
could
potentially
achieve
within
its
workplace
by--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
no.
even
if
the
scheme
here--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no,
i
submit
that
the
labor
peace
interest
isn't
valid
here
because
in
dealing
with
the
medicaid
program,
the
state
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
avoiding
competing
demands
from
rival
groups
regarding
its
policies
on
that.
that
is,
democratic--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
the
state
could
unilaterally
do
that,
without
bargaining
with
the
union.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
you
can.
at
least
two
ways.
the
first
of
which
is
that
knox,
of
course,
lays
out
a
two-part
test.
the
second
part
test
--
even
if
the
first
is
satisfied,
that
the
mandatory
association,
here
exclusive
representation,
is
justified
by
compelling
interest,
you
still
go
to
the
second
test
of
whether
or
not
fees
are
a
necessary
incident
to
that
representation,
and
i
submit
that
illinois
does
not
satisfy
that
test.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
it's
not
directly
challenged
in
this
case,
but
it
becomes
relevant
under
the
first
knox
test,
which
asks
whether
the
mandatory
association
being
supported
by
the
compulsory
fees
is
justified
by
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
this
case
does
not
present
the
question
of
whether
exclusive
representation
alone
would
constitute
a
first
amendment
injury,
because
the
complaint
here
is
focused
towards
the
compulsory
fees.
so
that
particular
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
in
the
public
sector,
yes,
that
it
is
in
fact
--
well,
the
first
public
sector
labor
law
was
actually
1959
in
wisconsin,
so
it's
relatively
recent
when
you're
involved
with
government.
yes,
our
position
is,
is
that
in
the
public
sector
when
government
is
involved
compulsory
fees
are
illegal
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
your
honor.
speaking
of
true
employees,
we're
not
speaking
of
medicaid
providers,
but
speaking
of
true
employees,
this
was
discussed
in
abood
with
respect
to
public
school
teachers
and
all
the
different
aspects
that
the
union
petitions
over
that
has
to
do
with
class
sizes,
hours
worked.
benefits
are
a
huge
issue,
of
course,
in
terms
of
financially
for
many
school
districts,
health
benefits.
so
there
are
many
issues
of
the
way
the
school
district
actually
operates.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no.
the
tasks
that
the
state
will
reimburse
are
set
in
a
service
plan.
that's
not
a
mandatory--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
what
--
as
far
as
what
they're
being
forced
to
support
is
the
reimbursement
rate.
the
state
is
giving
money
to
an
seiu
healthcare
fund,
which
many
providers
may
or
may
not
use.
the
state
is
giving
money
to
an
seiu
member
training
fund
to
provide
voluntary
training
to
providers,
and
also
to
conduct
an
orientation
that
new
providers
will
be
forced
to
support.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
well,
i
would
submit
that
they
shouldn't
be
forced
to
pay
for
any
of
this
petitioning
regarding
how
the
state
chooses
to
run
this
medicaid
program.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
that's
true
for
true
employees
under
this
court's
previous
cases,
but
the
question,
of
course,
here
is
do
those
same
principles
apply
to
medicaid
providers
or
anyone
else
who
receives
money
from
government.
and
that's--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--oh,
yes.
under
illinois
law,
they
have--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the
wage
--
in
fact,
defining
whether
it's
wages
or
a
flat
reimbursement
rate
or
a
grant
i
don't
--
i
submit
is
not
constitutionally
relevant.
so,
for
example,
the
act
was
recently
extended
to
independent
nurses
and
therapists
who
provide
in-home
care.
they're
paid
a
flat
rate
as
opposed
to
an
hourly,
what
do
you
call
it,
wage.
constitutionally,
there's
no
difference.
the
bottom
line
is
it's
money
from
government,
from
here
a
medicaid
program,
to
provide
care
to
other
individuals.
and
i
submit
that
doesn't
create
an
employment
relationship
any
more
than
a
doctor
is
privately
employed
by
a
health
insurer
--
insurance
company
merely
because
they
pay
for
it.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
that
is
paid,
but
the
state
is
doing
it
as
pay
agent.
and
so
while
the
money
is
coming
from
the
state,
the
state
is
doing
it
as
pay
agent
for
the
person
with
disabilities,
who
is
truly
the
employer.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
that's
right
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
that's
it's
solely
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
it's
right
in
the
statute.
the
state
said
it's
not
--
does
not
extend
vicarious
liability
to
independent
providers.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
sure.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
believe
there
--
the
reliance
interests
here
are
insignificant
if
abood
is
overruled
because
the
result
will
simply
be
that
employees
cannot
be
forced
to
support
union
representation.
the
state--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--because
the
union
first
would
control
their
terms
of
their
economic
conditions
of
employment
and
have
control
of
their
relations
with
their
employer,
which
creates
a
strong
incentive
for
an
employee
to
want
to
be
on
good
terms
with
that
union.
and
also,
usually,
the
union
gains
employer
assistance
with
becoming
an
exclusive
or
with
retaining
membership,
such
as
access
to
facilities--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes.
i
mean,
anyone
who
voluntarily--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--people
could
have
different
motives,
but
i
submit
that
the
union
has--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
well,
two
points.
first,
exclusive
representation,
i
submit,
is
not
an
impediment
to
gaining
membership.
it
helps
the
union
gain
voluntary
support
for
it.
it's
much
easier
for
a
union
to
ask
people
to
support
it
if
it
has
power
over
their
terms
of
employment.
so
the
free
rider
problem
with
an
exclusive
representative
is
actually
less
than
it
would
be
if
the
union
was
a
voluntary
organization,
not
as
--
it
doesn't
make
it
worse.
i
mean,
there's
a
reason
that
unions
seek
exclusive
representation
in
the
federal
government,
in
the
postal
service
and
the
nation's
24
right-to-work
states
because
it's--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--the
main
difference
is
just
the
compulsory
unionism
clause
in
the
agreement
would
be
gone.
but
otherwise,
the
agreements
would
be
the
same.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
would
submit
that
with
compelled
fees
off
the
table,
the
union
would
actually
have
more
leverage
to
get
things
for
employees
because
the
compelled
fees
clause
is
leveraged
for
the
employer.
because
that's
something
the
employer
--
or
the
union
wants
and
that
the
employer
doesn't
care
if
it
gives
it
away,
because
ultimately,
that's
money
out
of
somebody
else's
pocket.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
if
i
may
finish,
chief
justice.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
believe
that
they
probably
would
be
very
much
the
same.
to
the
extent
they'd
be
different,
they'd
be
more
in
the
favor
of
employees,
because
the
employer
wouldn't
have
that
leverage
over
the
union
with
respect
to
its
demand
for
compulsory
fees.
