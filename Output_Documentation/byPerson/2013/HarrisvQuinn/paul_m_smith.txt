mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
10
years
ago,
the
state
of
illinois
made
a
decision
about
the
best
way
to
deliver
homecare
services
to
thousands
of
persons
with
physical
disabilities
in
the
state
who
without
those
services
would
need
to
live
in
institutional
settings.
it
made
the
judgment
that
working
with
the
union
to
negotiate
and
implement
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
these
workers
that
it
was
paying
would
help
meet
its
service
delivery
goals
for
this
population,
this
group
of
workers,
which
was--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
is
no
reimbursement
rate
for
these
workers
set
by
the
medicaid
program,
your
honor.
the
amount
of
money
they
are
paid
is
an
hourly
wage
set
in
the
collectively
bargaining
agreement.
when
the
union
was
first
recognized,
it
was
$7
an
hour
and
there
were
no
benefits.
because
the
state
has
chosen
to
work
with
its
union,
it
has
produced
a
package
of
benefits
designed
to
create
a
solution
to
the
morale
problems,
the
recruitment
problems,
the
retention
problems.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
the
state's
judgment
is
that
it
can
better
make
these
determinations
in
partnership
with
the
union
and
that
the
process
of
negotiation
gives
it
both
tangible
and
intangible
benefits.
the
tangible
benefit
is
it
figures
out
what
the
priority
needs
of
the
workers
are.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
7
bucks
an
hour
was
what
they
were
getting
paid
before
the
union
was
on
the
scene,
your
honor,
and
the
state--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
state
did.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
it
gave
the
workers
the
opportunity,
as
it
has
every
right
to
do,
to
have
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
workforce
say,
we'd
like
to
be
represented,
we'd
like
to
have
somebody
in
the
room
representing
us.
and,
as
a
result,
they
not
only
have
substantially
increased
the
wages,
but
they
have
paid
health
care,
they
have
paid
training
and
orientation.
there's
a
grievance
system
which
is
a--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
in
this
kind
of
thing,
we're
talking
about
the
wages
of
basic
care
workers
like
if
they
were
in
a
nursing
home
or
in
a
state
hospital
or
wherever
they
might
be.
the
fact
that
medicaid--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
wages
for
these
kinds
of
workers
are
set
by
the
state
under
the
medicaid
program.
they're
not
set
by
the
federal
government,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
these
are
people
being
employed
by
the
state
with
money
that
happens
to
come
from
the
medicaid
program
in
order
--
it's
a
federal
project
to
get
people
out
of
nursing
homes
into
their
homes,
and
so
they
let
the
state
divert
money
over
to
pay
for
these
people
to
be
in
the
home.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
constitutional
challenge
in
this
case,
the
source
of
the
money,
the
state's
decision
about--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
my
understanding--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--‶
you
″
the
state
of
illinois,
you
mean?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
state
of
illinois,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
limitation.
i
expect
that
there
may
be
some
at
some
point,
but
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
the
exact
nature
of
the
fund
transfer
from
the
federal
government
to
the
state
may
well
be
based
on
an
individual's
annual
costs
with
a
particular
diagnosis.
i'm
in
the
realm
of
speculation
here,
but
it's
very
clear
from
this
record
that
these
decisions
about
how
these
individuals
will
be
paid
are
made
by
the
state,
and
that
they
have
the
discretion
under
the
program
to
do
that,
and
that
they
decided
that
they
would
deal
with
the
problems
of
recruitment
and
retention
and
morale
in
this
workforce,
which
is,
of
course,
scattered
to
tens
of
thousands
of
work
sites
across
the
country.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
state
of
illinois,
like
many
employers,
decided
that,
a,
they
would
get
that
right
more
likely
if
they
were
dealing
with
a
representative
of
the
workers
who
told
them
what
they
care
about,
whether
it's
paid
vacation
versus
higher
wages
versus
less
hours
during
the
week
or
more
hours
during
the
week
or
whatever
it
might
be.
it
also
said
that,
because
these
decisions
are
going
to
be
made
in
the
process
of
negotiation,
which
the
workers
know
they
have
a
place
at
the
table,
somebody
who
was
there
looking
out
for
their
interests,
the
workers
will
have
a
different
sense
of
commitment
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
court
has
correctly
held
over
a
period
of
more
than
30
years
that
that
requirement
is
an
appropriate
thing
which
a
public
employer
is
allowed
to
impose
because
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
because
of
the
benefits
of
allowing
collective
bargaining
to
proceed
with
the
duty
of
fair
representation
imposed
on
the
union.
as
justice
scalia
put
it
in
his
lehnert
opinion,
this
is
not
a
normal
sort
of
free
rider
argument.
this
is
a
free
rider
argument
where
the
law
requires
the
union
to
look
after
that
teacher
and
make
sure
that
they
get
treated
equally.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
that
is
the
system
we
have,
your
honor.
and
imagine
what
the
world
would
look
like
if
there
weren't--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
--
i
think
there
may
be
variation
on
that.
i
imagine
there
might
be
some
union
out
there
that
would
want
to
be
able
to
favor
their
members
over
other.
but
the
law
doesn't
require
that,
and
for
a
very
good
reason,
including
the
first
amendment
reason.
imagine
a
world
in
which
that
teacher
is
--
would
be
paid
10
percent
less
as
we
were
discussing
before,
because
that
teacher
has
chosen
not
to
be
a
full
member
of
the
union.
and
imagine
the
pressure
on
associational
rights
that
would
be
created
for
that
teacher
faced
with
that
choice.
you
could
be
paid
10
percent
less
doing
the
same
work,
or
you
can
be
paid
the
same
as
everybody
else,
but
you
have
to
fully
join
the
union
and
pay
for
their
political
speech
and
pay
for
everything
on
the
nonchargeable
side
of
the
line.
and,
you
know,
what
this
court
has
done
over
the
last
30
years
is
use
that
distinction
between
chargeable
and
nonchargeable
items
to
balance
the
first
amendment
interests
of
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
is
--
it
is
certainly
possible
that
in
some
situations--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
is
certainly
not
a
subject
of
collective
bargaining
that
could
arise
in
this
situation.
this
situation--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
--
it
is
possibly,
your
honor.
it's
entirely
up--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--assuming
--
assuming
a
school
district
decides
to
let--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--any
outcome
of
a
negotiation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
involving
public
employees
will
involve
the
expenditure
of
public
money
in
a
variety
of
ways,
and
the
outcome
of
that
will,
in
that
limited
sense,
at
least,
be
a
matter
of
public
concern
every
bit
as
much
and
--
and
no
more
than
when
a
government
contractor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
what
the
abood
distinction
between
chargeable
and
nonchargeable--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
while
there
is
an
impingement
on
the
first
amendment
interest
on
any
employer
--
employee
required
to
pay
the
fair
share
fee,
this
isn't
any
--
the
government
employee
context
in
which
the
government
has
the
ability
when
it
serves
its
important
interest
as
employer
to
demand
that
its
employees--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
look
at
--
look
at--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--look
at
what
the
union
is
--
what
the
--
what
the
money
is
being
spent
on
in
this
case.
it's
being
spent
on
negotiating
a
contract,
which
has
produced
a
package
of
benefits
and
wage
increases
that
have
been
extremely
important
to
everybody
in
--
in
this
workforce.
it's
being
spent
on
a
call
center
that
allows
people
to
call
to
their
union
and
get
answers
to
questions
about
problems,
a
grievance
system
that
makes
sure
their
paychecks
don't
go
missing
and
helps
them
address
that
problem,
training,
gloves
that
they
need
for
their
personal
safety
in
the
workplace,
and
healthcare
benefits.
now,
there
are
--
may
be
people
who
think
it's
political
controversial
to
have
to
contribute
to
a
union
that
does
those
things
and
nothing
else.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
balance
that
against
the
interests
of
the
state
as
employer
and
say
we
want
to
have
this
partnership
with
this
union.
this
will
help
us
do
a
better
job
delivering
services
to
this
vulnerable
population
and
save
us
a
lot
of
money
keeping
the
matter--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
could
i
just
hear
the
question
one
more
time?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
something
that's
not
within
the
chargeable
expenses
that
a
teachers'
union
could
charge.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
to
the
extent
that
you're
talking
about
the
negotiation
over
how
much
you're
going
to
be
paid
for
providing
services,
i
think
it's
perfectly
appropriate
under
the
court's
cases
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it's
on
the
chargeable
side
of
the
line
when
it
has
to
do
with
the
--
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
of
the
--
of
the
members
of
the
union
or
the
nonmembers
of
the
union.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
what
you
mean
by
medicaid
reimbursement
rates,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
hourly
rate
that's
going
to
be
paid
to
those
people--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
if
that's
what
you
mean,
then
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
charge
the
dissident
nonmember
because
that
person
is
going
to
get
all
the
benefit
of
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
to
the
extent--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
only
thing
that
can
be
negotiated
about
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
of
these
workers
that
is
within
the
control
of
the
state.
that's
what
the
illinois
statute
says.
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--in
the
--
in
the
limited
sense
that
they're
hourly
wages
going
to
these
individuals,
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
my
answer,
your
honor,
would
be
that
the
fact
that
it
is
a
public
employee
union,
representing
public
employees
means
that
in
one
sense,
everything
that
is
being
negotiated
could
be
viewed
as
a
greater
matter
of
public
concern.
on
the
other
hand,
that
is
not
a
reason,
as
abood
held,
to
up
the
ante
in
terms
of
constitutional
scrutiny.
to
the
contrary,
this
is
the
government
as
employer
dealing
with
its
employees
about
the
basic
terms
and
conditions
of
their
employment.
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
would
be
a
subject
if
the
state
chose
to
let
--
let
it
become
a
subject.
the
state
completely
controls
what
--
what
can
be
a
subject
of
collective
bargaining
and
what
can't.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
the
state
has
chosen
to
make
it
part
of
the
contract
that
can
be
negotiated,
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
that
person,
if
it's
not
paying
their
share
of
that,
then
you
have
two
things
that
happened.
the
other
members
--
the
other
people
in
the
workforce
have
to
pay
more
to
support
the
process,
or
the
union
doesn't
have
the
resources
needed
to
be
a
--
an
adequate
partner
with
the
state
in
producing
the
outcome
that
the
state
has
chosen
to
try
to
seek,
which
is
an
outcome
where
the
mutually
beneficial
arrangements
are
made
that
satisfy
the
priorities
of
everybody
here,
the
workers
and
the
state
and,
indeed,
the
clients
that
they
serve.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
what's
missing
i
think
in
this
conversation,
your
honor,
is
that
all
of
these
burdens
on
people's
associational
rights
or
free
speech
rights
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
arises
only
because
somebody
has
chosen
to
come
take
this
job
working
for
the
state
on
the
terms
the
state
offers.
and
as
you've
said
many
times--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--when
there
are
substantial
interests
of
the
government
as
employer
that
are
served
by
the
sacrifice.
what
you've
said
over
and
over
in
duryea,
in
garcetti,
and
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
is
the
government
gets
to
have
leeway
as
an
employer
when
there
are
real
interests
at
stake,
and
that
in
that
situation,
the
employee
could
be
put
to
the
choice.
thank
you,
your
honor.
