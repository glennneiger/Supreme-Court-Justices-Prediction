justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
have
a
policeman
who
--
who
is
dissatisfied
with
his
wages.
so
he
makes
an
appointment
with
the
commissioner,
police
commissioner,
and
he
goes
in
and
grouses
about
his
wages.
he
does
this,
you
know,
10
or
11
times.
and
the
commissioner
finally
is
fed
up
and
tells
his
secretary,
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
see
this
man
again.
has
he
violated
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
prevented
a
petition
for
a
redress
of
grievances?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
understand
that.
when
--
when
you
--
so
what
if
it's
10
policemen
who
do
this?
it's
still
not
a
matter
of
public
concern?
does
it
have
to
be
the
whole
police
force?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
always
a
matter
of
public
concern,
whether
you're
going
to
raise
the
salaries
of
policemen,
whether
it's
an
individual
policeman
asking
for
that
or
--
or
a
--
a
combination
of
policemen
or
a
union.
it's
a
always
a
matter
of
public
concern,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
to
not
--
not
give
this
guy
an
appointment
for
the
12th
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
he
shut
his
door
if
he
has
a
right
to
petition,
a
constitutional
right
to
petition
for
the
redress
of
grievances?
his
grievance
is
he's
not
being
paid
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
the
same
grievance
if
the
union
had
presented
it.
the
--
the
grievance
is
the
salaries
for
policemen
are
not
high
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
asking
for
just
his
salary
to
be
raised.
he
wants
salaries
of
all
--
all
the
cops
to
be
raised.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
messenger,
just
to
clarify
what
was
the
purpose
of
my
earlier
line
of
questioning,
it
was
simply
to
show
that
if
you
have
a
case
it
doesn't
rest
on
the
right
to
petition
the
government
for
redress
of
grievances.
it
--
it
rests
on
the
first
amendment.
you
--
you
say
that
there
is
being
--
your
--
your
people
are
being
required
to
support
speech
that
they
don't
agree
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that
is,
you
know,
that
is
an
arguable
position,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
even
arguable
that
the
right
to
petition
the
government
for
redress
of
grievances
is
--
is
involved
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
first
amendment
violation,
not
a
violation
--
not
a
denial
of
the
right
to
petition
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
was
the
question?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
hear
the
answer,
too,
because,
contrary
to
what
justice
kagan
suggests,
i
--
i
didn't
say
your
first
amendment
argument
was
valid.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
said
at
least
it
was
a
comprehensible
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it
is
for
private
employers.
there
are
some
private
employers
who
think
they're
better
off
with
a
closed
shop
and
they
just
want
to
deal
with
one
union
and
--
and
they
require
all
the
people
that
they
hire
to
become
a
member
of
this
union
and
to
pay
union
dues
for
representational
purposes.
they
do
this
as
private
employers
because
they
think
it
is
in
their
interest
as
an
employer.
why
can't
the
government
have
the
same
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
but
--
but
don't
tell
me
that
there's
no
employer
interest.
there
is
an
employer
interest.
you're
just
saying
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
considerable
enough,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
fact
that
you're
entitled
to
speak
against
abortion
would
not
justify
the
government
in
requiring
you
to
give
money
to
planned
parenthood?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
argument
you're
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
things
you
can
argue
are
not
part
of
the
representation
for
which
they
should
be
charged
and
they
should
get
their
money
back
for
those
things
if
they're
actually
not
--
not
getting
any
benefit
from
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
they're
--
i
mean,
what
our
cases
say
is
you
--
you
can
be
compelled
not
to
be
a
free
rider,
to
--
to
pay
for
those
items
of
bargaining
that
benefit
you
as
well
as
everybody
else.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
stuff
that
--
that
is
not
within
that
description,
stuff
that
doesn't
benefit
you
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
if
there
were
no
union,
there
would
be
no
wages?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
from
the
outset,
it
set
up
the
union,
right,
and
the
union
said,
we
want
7
bucks
an
hour.
was
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who
picked
that
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
did.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
one
can
be
skeptical
about
whether,
when
states
do
this
they
are
doing
it
because
it's
more
--
more
efficient
as
an
employer,
because
some
states
have
tried
to
force
private
employers
to
have
a
closed
shop,
haven't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no,
you
know,
no
state
government
interest
in
it.
there's
just
state
interest
in
unions.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
unions
getting
a
lot
of
money
from
people
who
don't
belong
in
the
unions.
so
one
can
be
skeptical
about
whether
this
is
really
what's
going
on,
that
the
state
really
thinks
it's
going
to
be
a
lot
easier
if
it
has
a
closed
shop.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
do
so
because
of
that
reason.
you
don't
know
what
their
reason
is
any
more
than
i
do.
all
you
can
say
is
that
that
might
be
their
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
it's
only
people
who
--
who
disagree
with
the
--
what
the
union's
doing
who
could
refuse
to
pay,
you
say?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
people
who
--
who
agree
with
the
union
just
say,
hey,
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
to
pay.
the
union
is
going
to
do
this
stuff
anyway.
i'm
going
to
ride
for
free.
these
other
people
are
riding
for
free.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
way
to
decide
who's
doing
it
just
to
save
money
and
who's
doing
it
on
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
you're
essentially
destroying
not
just
the
--
not
just
the
--
the
--
closed
shop,
but
you're
destroying
the
ability
of
the
union
to
--
to
get
money
even
from
the
people
who
don't
agree
with
what
it's
doing.
