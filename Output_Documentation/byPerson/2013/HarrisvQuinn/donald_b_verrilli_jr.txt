mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
line
drawn
in
abood
is
sound.
it
has
the
force
of
stare
decisis
behind
it,
it
is
completely
consistent
with
this
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence,
and
it
requires
affirmance.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
questions
that
justice
kennedy
has
raised
because
i
do
think
it
gets
to
the
key
issue
in
the
case.
i
think
the
key
point,
the
key
takeaway
in
this
case,
is
that
the
context
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
government
as
proprietor
and
manager
of
its
own
operations.
and
this
court's
case
law
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
in
that
context,
two
things
follow.
first,
the
government's
interest
in
the
effective
and
efficient
carrying
out
of
its
own
operations
is
entitled
to
very
substantial
weight,
more
substantial
weight
than
it
would
get
if
you
were
looking
at
the
government
as
a
sovereign
regulating
the
citizenry.
and
second,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
indeed
as
your
honors'
opinion
in
garcetti
and
your
honors'
opinion
in
borough
of
duryea
recognized
both
times,
the
employees'
first
amendment
interests
are
diminished
to
the
extent
that
the
government
has
more
latitude
when
the
government
can
show
that
the
obligation
it
is
imposing
is
in
furtherance
of
the
government's
legitimate
interests
as
manager
of
its
own
operations.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
let
me
do
my
best
to
try
to
clear
that
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
best
answer
i
can
to
your
question.
remember
medicaid
of
course
is
a
joint
federal/state
program.
the
federal
government
provides
funds;
the
state
provides
funds.
here
we're
operating
within
a
waiver
program
in
which
the
state
is
given
considerable
latitude
to
set
wages
and
set
rates
so
long
as
it
is
saving
money
as
compared
to
the
institutionalization
of
this
population.
my
understanding
is
that
hhs
will
review
wage
rates
set
to
make
sure
that
they
meet
very
general
parameters.
they
were
of
the
kind
described
in
the
douglas
case
that
was
before
the
court
a
couple
of
years
ago.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
are
they
high
enough
to
make
sure
the
services
providing
--
they're
provided
effectively
and
are
they
--
and
are
they
constrained
enough--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--right,
but
it's
not
that
the
--
but
the
federal
government
isn't
approving
the
specific
hourly
wage
rate
as
medicaid
reimbursement
within
this
program.
that's
a
judgment
that
the
medicaid
program
leaves
to
the
considerable
discretion
of
the
state.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
not
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
applying
the
line
of
lehnert,
that
that
would
be
on
the
impermissible
side
of
the
line.
that
would
be
effectively
seeking
to
change
public
policy
by
changing
what
the
legislature
or
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
--
my
understanding
is
that
that
would
be
--
the
question
there
was
at
which
side
of
the
line
that
the
court
drew
in
lehnert
is
that
on.
i
think
that's
probably
on
the
--
on
the
impermissible
side
of
the
line.
but
that's
where
the
fight
would
be.
it
would
be
over
where
that
line
should
be
drawn,
not
over
whether
the
--
whether
the
state,
as
manager
of
its
own
operations,
can
use
collective
bargaining
with
a
fair
share,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier,
in
a
way
that
private
employers
routinely
do.
i
mean,
i
do
think
that's
the
fundamental
point
of
abood,
that
private
--
that
the
government
as
employer,
as
manager
of
its
own
operations,
ought
to
be
able
to
make
the
same
kind
of
choice
that
private
employers
make
when
they
think
it
advances
their
interests
in
efficiency
and
sound
operations.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
they
would
not,
justice
alito,
and
we're
not
--
we're
not
here
making
an
argument
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
states
ought
to
adopt
fair
share
or
not.
the
thing
that
matters
to
us
is
the
principle
of
first
amendment
law
that's
at
stake.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
hasn't,
but
the
key
point
for
us,
the
point
of
vital
importance
for
the
united
states
here,
is
that
the
court
continue
to
recognize
the
context,
the
first
amendment
context
of
the
government
as
manager
of
its
own
operations.
and
whatever
choice
the
united
states
has
made,
many
states
have
made
different
choices
in
their
role
as
manager
of
their
own
operations.
and
under
this
court's
established
case
law,
which
abood,
i
think,
is
a
quite
good
example
of,
the
principle
that
when
the
government
is
acting
to
further
its
operations
as
manager
they
get
substantial
latitude.
now,
there's
a
limit
on
that,
of
course.
they
can't
use
that
authority
to
--
they
can't
leverage
that
authority
to
affect
the
way
citizens
interact
as
citizens--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
but
here
we
argue--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
guess
what
i
would
say
about
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
one
could
speculate
about
motives
of
states
like
illinois,
one
could
speculate
about
motives
of
the
right
to
work
states,
but
i
would
suggest
that
under
our
federal
system
that
states
get
to
make
those
kinds
of
policy
choices.
and
illinois
has
made
a
policy
choice,
as
many
private
employers
have,
that
using
collective
bargaining
--
and
it
is,
i
want
to
stress
here,
very
narrowly
tailored
collective
bargaining.
by
law,
it
can
only
be
over
wages,
hours,
and
conditions
of
employment,
by
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
when
the
legislation
was
enacted,
it
was
enacted
with
a
very
large
bipartisan
margin,
and
i
just
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
in
the
context
of
the
government
as
manager
of
its
own
operations
to
look
behind
and
try
to
consider
motive.
this
is
a
choice
that
many--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--whatever
happened--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
was
enacted
subsequent
to
that
by
a
large
bipartisan
majority,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
look
behind
the
legislature's
action
to
consider
and
try
to
evaluate
its
motives.
and
i
think
under
our
federal
system
states
get
to
make
choices.
it's
true
not
every
state
does
it
this
way,
but
many
do.
they
do
so
for
reasons
of
efficient
management
of
their
internal
operations
and
that's
the
principle
that
we
think
is
of
critical
importance
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
they
ought
to
have
the
discretion
to
make
that
choice
under
this
court's
case
law.
that's
our
position
with
respect
to
that.
if
i
could
make
a
point
that
i
think
is
an
important
point
about
the
free
rider
rationale
under
abood.
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
the
point
of
the
free
rider
rationale
is
to
--
is
to
force
the
dissenters,
the
nonunion
members
to
pay
up.
i
don't
think
that's
the
right
way
to
understand
the
free
rider
point.
that
once
the
state
has
imposed
a
duty
of
fair
representation,
then
everybody's
got
an
incentive
to
free
ride,
whether
you're
a
union
supporter
or
not,
because
by
operation
of
law,
you're
going
to
get
the
benefit.
it's
just
a
classic
logic
of
collective
action
problem.
and
so
the
--
the
fair
share
requirement
really
is
content
neutral
in
that
it's
--
it's
designed
to
ensure
that
the
union
has
the
funds
it
needs
to
carry
out
the
responsibilities
that
the
state
wants
it
to
carry
out
and
that
that
could
be
jeopardized
by
supporters
as
well
as
dissidents,
deciding
that
they
--
that
they
don't
want
to
pay
because
they
don't
have
to,
because
the
law
would
get
them
the
benefit
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
even
if
they
didn't.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
--
of
whether
abood
should
be
overruled,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
got
a
very
powerful
stare
decisis
effect
behind
it.
abood's
not
exactly
an
outlier.
it
was
reaffirmed
in
lehnert,
in
ellis.
it
was
reaffirmed
just
in
2009
unanimously
in
the
locke
case.
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
there
is
very
substantial
reliance,
and
contractual
reliance
throughout
the
country
on
the
constitutionality
of
abood.
and
as
i
--
i
said,
i
think
the
most
important
point
here
is
that
the
line
the
court
drew
in
abood
and
the
line
that
has
stood
for
40
years
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence
in
the
context
of
government
as
employer,
not
as
regulator
of
sovereign.
of
course,
if
the
government
was
acting
as
sovereign
regulating
the
citizenry,
an
obligation
of
this
kind
would
trigger
the
most
exacting
scrutiny.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
certainly,
that
question
has
been
raised.
but
those
questions
were
actually
all
raised
before--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--before
it
was
reaffirmed
in
lehnert,
before
it
was
reaffirmed
in
ellis
and
before
it
was
reaffirmed
unanimously
in
locke.
thank
you.
