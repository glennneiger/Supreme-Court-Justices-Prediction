justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
come
back,
i'd
appreciate
your
thinking
about
this,
but
obviously
you're
asking
us
to
overturn
a
case
that's
been
the
law
for
35
years.
i
count
hundreds
of
citations
in
the
opinion,
and
i
guess
there
are
millions
of
instances
in
which
employees
and
employers
and
others
have
relied
on
it
in
collective
bargaining,
so
i'd
appreciate
your
saying
sentence
a
or
two
of
why
we
should
upset
reasonable
expectations
over
so
long
a
period
of
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
you're
being
asked,
i
think,
is
a
broader
question.
collective
bargaining
with
any
employer,
meat
packers,
hours,
safety
depends
on
hours,
always
can
involve
public
interest
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
think
the
question
you're
being
asked
is
where
you
have
seiu
or
afscme,
and
they're
government
unions,
does
it
have
a
bigger
mix
of
public
policy
issues;
and
therefore,
should
this
court
get
into
the
business
--
i'm
putting
it
in
a
little
loaded
way
because
i
don't
want
to
suggest
the
answer.
should
this
court
make
that
distinction
and
get
into
the
business
of
saying
when
the
union
is
too
much
of
a
labor
--
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
are
too
likely
to
affect
public
issues,
and
the
other
ones
less
likely,
et
cetera,
you
see
the
distinction
that
the
question
that
was
added
suggests?
now,
i
would
like
you
to
think
about
--
that's
a
philosophical
question
or
a
very
broad
first
amendment
question.
and
i'd
like
to
hear
what
your
answer
is
and
the
government's.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suspect
you're
going
to
answer
my
question,
so
i
want
to
focus
it
--
and
i'm
sorry
to
do
this,
but
i
think
it's
important.
all
right.
i
suspect
you
cannot
answer
my
question
about
reliance
without
accepting
one
of
the
following
three
propositions:
first,
unlike
every
other
employee,
government
employees
have
no
right
to
organize.
or
second,
they
have
a
right
to
organize,
but
they
cannot
bargain
about
wages,
working
conditions
and
hours
unlike
any
other.
that's
the
same
as
the
first.
or,
third,
the
courts
of
the
united
states
are
going
to
fashion,
using
the
first
amendment
as
their
weapon,
a
new
special
labor
law
for
government
employees.
and
i'd
remind
you
we
have
some
experience
on
that
in
the
1930s
where
courts
tried
to
do
something
analogous.
now
answer
my
question
about
reliance.
