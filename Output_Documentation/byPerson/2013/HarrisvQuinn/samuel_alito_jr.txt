justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
messenger,
i'm
confused
by
this
whole
line
of
argumentation.
i
didn't
think
there
was
any
issue
in
this
case
about
the
right
of
the
plaintiffs
or
any
of
the
other
affected
workers
to
say
whatever
they
want
on
their
own.
that
--
they're
not
prohibited
from
doing
that,
are
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
there
isn't
any
issue
about
that
in
the
case.
i
thought
the
issue
--
and
they
can
try
to
--
to
meet
with
anybody
they
want
as
many
times
as
they
want.
i
suppose
that
--
that
person
has
a
perfect
right
to
say:
enough
is
enough;
i
don't
want
to
meet
with
you
for
the
fifth
or
for
the
first
time.
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
they
could
be
required
to
pay
for
somebody
else
to
go
and
speak
and
possibly
say
things
that
they
disagree
with.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
messenger,
do
you
think
the
issue
of
exclusive
representation
is
inextricably
tied
to
the
issue
of
the
assessment
of
an
agency
fee?
can't
you
have
the
former
without
the
latter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
state
took
the
position
that
these
individuals
are
state
employees
for
one
purpose
only,
collectively
bargaining.
isn't
that
their
position.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
one
of
these
individuals
commits
gross
misconduct,
causes
the
death
of
a
patient,
the
state
has
no
liability?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
smith,
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
the
union's
participation
in
this
is
essential.
the
state
can
say,
this
is
how
much
these
people
are
being
paid,
it's
not
enough,
we
want
to
increase
it,
we
want
to
increase
it
by
10
percent,
20
percent,
30
percent,
whatever
it
is.
they
need
some
--
they
should
have
extra
benefits.
well,
we'll
give
them
these
benefits
and
these
benefits
and
these
benefits.
why
do
they
need
to
have
the
union
intervene
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
fine
for
the
workers
who
want
the
union
to
represent
them
in
making
these
demands.
let
me
give
you
this
example,
which
i
think
gets
to
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
find
disturbing.
let's
say
this
is
--
this
involves
the
a
teachers
union.
so
the
teachers
union
is
negotiating
about
the
issue
of
tenure
and
merit
pay,
and
the
union
is
opposed
to
any
change
in
the
tenure
system,
it's
opposed
to
merit
pay.
now,
there's
a
teacher
who's
not
a
member
of
the
union
who
disagrees
completely
with
the
union
on
these
issues,
but
this
teacher
--
and
the
teacher
is
not
a
member
of
the
union,
but
still
has
to
pay
a
pretty
hefty
agency
fee,
maybe
$700
a
year.
so
the
teacher
is
paying
this
money
to
the
union
to
make
an
argument
to
the
employer
with
which
the
teacher
completely
disagrees.
now,
if
this
teacher
just
wants
to
get
back
to
a
neutral
position,
the
teacher
is
going
to
have
to
spend
$700
or
maybe
$500
of
his
or
her
own
money,
pay
that
to
another
organization
that
will
present
that
teacher's
point
of
view
to
the
employer.
how
can
that
be
--
what
would
you
say
to
that,
to
that
teacher?
that,
you
know,
you
have
a
right
to
be
--
you
have
a
right
to
say
whatever
you
want
on
these
issues,
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
be
a
teacher?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
smith,
are
you
saying
that
this
--
that
the
unions
reluctantly
accept
the
duty
of
being
the
exclusive
representative
for
all
the
employees?
they
don't
really
want
to
do
this,
but
the
law
requires
them
to
do
this,
but
because
the
law
requires
them
to
do
this
then
they
have
to
get
this
agency
fee?
is
that
really
--
is
that
realistically
what
happens?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
seriously,
the
unions
do
not
want
to
have
the
--
they
don't
want
to
be
given
the
status
of
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
issue
of--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
pensions.
now,
that's
a
very
big
public
policy
issue.
i
think
in
illinois,
the
legislature
recently
cut
pensions
of
--
of
public
employees.
that
would
be
a
subject
--
that
could
be
a
subject
of
--
of
collective
bargaining,
right?
so
that
would
be
--
bargaining
on
that
would
be
chargeable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
--
if
the
union
spends
a
lot
of
money
trying
to
bargain
on
that
issue,
that's
--
that's
a
chargeable
expense,
is
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
young
employee
who
is
not
very
much
concerned
at
this
point
about
pensions,
but
realizes
there's
a
certain
pot
of
money,
and
it's
either
going
to
go
for
pensions
or
it's
going
to
go
for
salary
at
the
present
time.
so
that
employee
who's
not
a
member
of
the
union
has
to
pay
for
the
union
to
bargain
with
the
--
the
state
to
achieve
something
that's
contrary
to
that
person's
interest.
but
you
say
that
person
is
a
free
rider.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
to
be
unionized
--
excuse
me
--
in
a
unionized
federal
workplace,
would
they
be
assessed
a
mandatory
agency
fee?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
federal
government
doesn't
think
that
it
needs
to
assess
a
mandatory
agency
fee
from,
let's
say,
the
employees
in
the
border
patrol.
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
border
patrol
has
high
morale,
sufficient
salary,
sufficient
benefits,
it
can
do
without
the
agency
fee
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
specific
factual
background
of
what
occurred
here
provides
a
basis
for
skepticism
about
illinois's
reason
for
adopting
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
situation
was
that
government
blagojevich
got
a
huge
campaign
contribution
from
the
union
and
virtually
as
soon
as
he
got
into
office
he
took
out
his
pen
and
signed
an
executive
order
that
had
the
effect
of
putting,
what
was
it,
$3.6
million
into
the
union
coffers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
the
sequence;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
true
that
from
--
from
the
beginning,
there
have
been
members
of
this
court
who
have
questioned
whether
there
is
any
principled
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
chargeable
and
the
nonchargeable
expenses
and
also
have
questioned
whether
as
a
practical
matter
that
can
be
done?
justice
marshall
made
that
argument,
did
he
not?
