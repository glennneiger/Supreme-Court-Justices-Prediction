i
thought
it
was
to
negotiate
--
or
it's
typically
negotiated
in
collective
bargaining;
that
is,
wages,
is
that
not
so?
wages
and
benefits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
does
it
differ
from
the
typical
bargaining
that
a
union
does?
it
asks
for
a
wage
rate
and
it
asks
for
various
benefits.
so
are
you
saying
that
when
it's
a
public
--
in
the
public
sector,
it
gets
converted
into
something
else?
justice

but
you're
not
--
you're
not
challenging
--
or
it's
confusing
whether
you
are
or
not
--
the
very
idea
of
exclusive
representation
by
a
union.
are
you
saying
that
in
the
public
sector,
there
cannot
be
exclusive
--
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent?
justice
ruth
bader

is
the
mandatory
--
let's
take
out,
as
justice
alito
suggested,
take
out
the
agency
fee
or
fair-share
fee
or
whatever
it
is.
but
there
is
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
workers,
your
clients,
say
we
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
that
union.
the
union
is
authorized
to
represent
everybody
in
the
workplace
and
has
to
represent
even
nonmembers
as
well
without
any
discrimination.
and
--
and
are
you
taking
the
position
that
there
cannot
be
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent
if
there
are
any
dissenters
who
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
a
union?

they
receive
a
salary
--
i
mean,
they
receive
--
it's
not
a
government
branch
to
the
--
to
the
healthcare
worker.
they
receive
a
paycheck
and
the
government
withholds
from
them.
the
government
makes
a
fica
contribution
for
them
and
withholds
the
part
that's
their
responsibility.
so
it
looks
just
like
they
are
an
employee
of
the
government,
being
paid
by
the
government,
and
the
government
doing
things
that
an
employer
does:
withhold
income
tax,
pay
in
part
the
fica
tax,
withhold
the
other
part.
and
they
are
--
they're
also
covered
by
workers'
compensation,
aren't
they?

as
--
as
employees
of
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
not
getting
a
paycheck
and
the
insurance
--
insurer
is
not
deducting
withholding
tax,
isn't
paying
fica
tax?
