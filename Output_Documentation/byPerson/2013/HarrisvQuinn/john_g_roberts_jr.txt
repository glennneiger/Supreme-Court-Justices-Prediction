chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-681,
harris
v.
quinn.
mr.
messenger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
there
any
--
you
suggest,
in
response
to
my
colleague's
question,
that
they
could
--
the
state
could
pay
health
care
providers
different
rates.
are
there
any
limitations?
we're
talking
about
medicaid
reimburse.
are
there
any
limitations
that
would
prevent
differential
rates
of
pay,
reimbursement,
under
medicaid
for
the
same
services?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
jump
in
whenever
you'd
like.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
medicaid
had
something
to
do
with
how
much
they
were
reimbursed.
you're
saying
medicaid
is
beside
the
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
hire
a
homecare
provider
to
provide
homecare
services,
isn't
how
much
the
person
is
compensated
--
you
have
a
medicaid
program,
a
cooperative
program
with
the
federal
government.
doesn't
it
set
the
rates
with
which
those
services
are
reimbursed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right,
it's
a
cooperative
state/federal
program.
but
isn't
there
--
are
you
saying
the
wages
have
nothing
to
do
with
how
much
the
--
the
medicaid
reimbursement
for
these
types
of
services?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
don't
just
give
you
a
bunch
of
money
and
say,
well,
here
it
is,
you
figure
out
how
much
you
want
to
--
i
mean,
i
thought
this
case
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
medicaid
was
used
to
reimburse
these
employees,
and
you're
saying
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
want
to
know,
not
what
their
challenge
is.
i
want
to
know
where
the
money
comes
from.
it
comes
from
medicaid,
and
i
assume
medicaid
sets
some
parameters
about
how
much
you
can
reimburse
homecare
providers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
can
negotiate
whatever
rates
you
want
with
the
homecare
providers
regardless
of
what
medicaid
says
about
those
services?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
thing.
mr.
smith,
the
first
word
in
your
brief
is
‶
medicaid
″.
i
don't
understand,
because
the
argument
can
be
made
that
medicaid
reimbursement
rates
is
an
important
public
policy
issue,
not
simply
a
labor
issue.
now,
let's
say
you
have
a
teachers'
union,
okay?
they
think
it's
a
very
important
public
issue.
they
have
a
platform.
they
engage
in
activities
to
get
higher
medicaid
reimbursement
rates.
is
that
something
that
a
nonunion
member
would
have
to
pay
for
or
would
they
--
would
that
expense
be
segregated
out
of
what
they
must
pay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
teacher
--
teacher
union,
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
have
a
political
position
on
medicaid
rates.
they
spend
money
to
advance
that
position.
if
you're
a
teacher,
but
you're
not
a
member
of
the
union,
do
you
have
to
pay
for
that
expenditure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
same
--
same
public
--
same
expenses
for
medicaid--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
you're
a
home
care
provider.
your
union
spends
to
get
higher
medicaid
rates.
you're
not
a
member
of
the
union.
do
you
have
to
pay
for
their
political
activity
to
raise
medicaid
rates?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
one
--
i'm
sorry.
if
i
could
just
finish
the
thought.
so
the
same
speech
with
respect
to
one
union
is
a
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
but
with
respect
to
another
union,
it's
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
it's
medicaid.
now,
is
that
part
of
the
chargeable
expenses
or
not?
this
union
wants
to
talk
about
medicaid
reimbursement
rates.
can
a
nonunion
member
be
compelled
to
share
that
expense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean
medicaid
reimbursement
rates.
that's
what
i
mean
by
medicaid
reimbursement
rates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
if
this
union
negotiates
over
medicaid
reimbursement
rates,
it
is
chargeable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though,
what
i
understood
your
answer
to
be,
is
that
medicaid
reimbursement
rates
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
includes
medicaid
reimbursement
rates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
verrilli,
does
medicaid
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
your
statement
of
interest
--
your
statement
of
interest
explaining
why
you
are
here
today
discusses
the
effect
of
the
medicaid
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
union
wants
to
talk
about
medicaid
rates
with
the
state
because
they
would
get
a
higher
wage
or
could
get
a
higher
wage
if
medicaid
reimbursement
was
higher,
is
that
within
the
--
their
functioning
as
a
union
rather
than
a
political
group?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
so
if
the
union
wants
to
say,
look,
the
only
way
our
people
are
going
to
get
higher
wages
is
if
there's
a
higher
medicaid
reimbursement
rate
for
this
service,
that
is
not
within
the
scope
of
collective
bargaining?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
messenger,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
