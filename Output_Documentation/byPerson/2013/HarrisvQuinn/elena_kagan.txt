justice
elena
kagan
but
your
argument,
of
course,
isn't
limited
to
that.
it
goes
beyond
that
situation?
justice
elena
kagan
but
what
--
what
you're
objecting
to,
to
the
extent
that
you're
not
objecting
to
the
entire
system
of
collective
bargaining,
you're
objecting
--
you're
saying
an
individual
employee
can
say
i
don't
feel
like
supporting
a
union
that
makes
a
certain
kind
of
argument
about
wages
or
about
benefits.
so,
just
to
carry
on
with
justice
scalia's
example,
the
subject
matter
is
the
exact
same
in
the
two
contexts,
whether
it's
an
individual
employee
or
whether
it's
a
union,
and
in
both
contexts,
the
--
the
ultimate
sanction
is
the
same,
right?
somebody
grouses
about
his
pay
too
much,
he
could
get
fired.
somebody
refuses
to
support
a
union
that
is
negotiating
about
pay,
he
can
lose
his
job.
so
it's
--
it's
really
identical
across
the
two
situations.
justice
elena
kagan
same
subject
matter,
same
sanction.
what's
the
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you're
not
objecting,
i
think,
to
the
union
as
a
whole.
what
you're
objecting
to
is
an
individual
employee
having
to
support
that
activity.
the
scale
is
no
different.
it's
an
individual
employee.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
exactly
what
the
individual
employee
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
is
arguing
for.
he
wants
wage
rates
to
be
changed
across
the
board.
he
knows
they're
not
going
to
be
changed
just
for
him.
he
wants
higher
wage
rates.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger,
i'm
not
sure
that
justice
scalia's
answer
satisfies
his
own
question.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
because
here's
the
thing:
that
in
the
workplace
we've
given
the
government
a
very
wide
degree
of
latitude
and
there's
much
that
the
government
can
do.
it
can
fire
people.
it
can
demote
people
for
things
that
they
say
in
the
workplace,
not
for
things
that
they
say
as
a
citizen,
but
for
things
that
they
say
in
the
workplace.
that's
the
fundamental
lesson
of
garcetti
and
of
many,
many
others
of
our
cases.
so
you're
saying,
well,
the
government
can
punish
somebody
for
saying
something,
but
the
government
in
the
exact
same
position
cannot
compel
somebody
to
say
something
they
disagree
with.
and
i
want
to
know
what's
the
basis
for
that
distinction,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
just
as
hard
as
--
as
if
you
were
answering
under
the
petition
clause.
justice
elena
kagan
good,
okay.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger--
justice
elena
kagan
--so,
mr.
messenger,
even
on
the
compulsory
fees,
i
mean,
what
strikes
me
is
that
this
is
--
i'm
just
going
to
use
the
word
here,
it
is
a
radical
argument.
it
would
radically
restructure
the
way
workplaces
across
this
country
are
--
are
run.
and
let
me
just
put
it
to
you
this
way
and
ask
if
you
agree
with
this
--
with
this
statement.
since
1948,
since
the
taft-hartley
act,
there
has
been
a
debate
in
every
state
across
this
country
about
whether
to
be
a
right-to-work
state
and
people
have
disagreed.
some
states
say
yes,
some
states
say
no.
it
raises
considerable
heat
and
passion
and
tension,
as
we
recently
saw
in
wisconsin.
and
--
but,
you
know,
these
are
public
policy
choices
that
states
make.
and
is
it
fair
to
say
that
what
you're
suggesting
here,
your
argument,
is
essentially
to
say
that
for
65
years,
people
have
been
debating
the
wrong
question
when
they've
been
debating
that,
because,
in
fact,
a
right-to-work
law
is
constitutionally
compelled?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger,
do
you
doubt
that
these
--
you
said
that
there
were
no
reliance
interests,
and
--
and
that's
curious
to
me.
there
must
be
thousands
and
thousands
of
contracts
across
the
united
states
with
fair
share
provisions.
do
you
doubt
that
these
were
core
central
provisions
in
the
making
of
these
contracts?
that
if
these
kinds
of
provisions
were
prohibited,
the
--
the
agreements
would
look
fundamentally
different
in
many
ways?
justice
elena
kagan
you
think
that
the
union
would
--
would
not
ask
for
anything,
would
not
have
different
--
you
know,
would
not
ask
for
different
mechanisms
in
order
to
support
its
own
activity?
the
unions
go
into
these
contracts
with
the
understanding
that
this
is
what's
going
to
enable
them
to
at
once
satisfy
their
universal
obligation
to
employees
to
fairly
represent
them
and
also,
get
the
funds
they
need
for
administrative
and
other
expenses.
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
think
that
if
we
just
strike
these
provisions,
in
other
words,
the
--
the
contracts
would
have
been
negotiated
in
exactly
the
same
way,
nothing
else
would
have
changed?
