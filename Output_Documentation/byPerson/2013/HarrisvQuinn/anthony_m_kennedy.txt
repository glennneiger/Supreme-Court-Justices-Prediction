justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
likelihood
that
the
union
that
represents
these,
what
i
call
them
healthcare
workers,
health
providers,
care
providers,
is
there
any
likelihood
that
they
would
try
to
bargain
for
benefits
for
these
--
these
workers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
yes.
is
there
any
likelihood?
do
we
know
anything
about
what
the
likelihood
would
be
for
certain
subjects
to
be
brought
up
in
the
bargaining
with
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
i
suppose
there
could
be
labor
peace
if
the
respondents
were
to
prevail.
i
mean,
that
--
that
assumes
that
your
theory
of
the
case
is
going
--
is
going
to
prevail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
doesn't
the
--
isn't
there
labor
peace
--
let's
assume
that's
a
valid
interest
--
isn't
there
labor
peace
if
one
union
represents
these
health
care
providers
and
makes
and
negotiates
a
contract
with
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
doesn't
it?
it
--
it
gets
the
demand
from
the
union,
it
recognizes
it's
reasonable;
that's
the
policy
and
then
it
can
move
forward
with
the
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
court
were
to
say
that
on
the
issue
of
salaries
there
is
no
first
amendment
violation,
that
--
that
abood
should
remain
applicable
to
public
employee
unions.
are
there
other
issues
that
public
employee
unions
necessarily
raise
in
collective
bargaining
that
raise
other
concerns
about
governmental
policies
that
union
members
might
disagree
with?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
talking
about
first
amendment
interests,
let
me
ask
you
this:
is
it
not
a
standard
issue
in
collective
bargaining
for
the
employees'
union
to
talk
about
the
size
of
the
workforce?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
necessarily
so
if
they're
talking
about
hours.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
would
you
think
that
this
is
a
legitimate
subject
of
collective
bargaining
for
which
the
nonunion
member
has
to
pay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
let's
say
the
teachers'
union.
they're
talking
about
classroom
size.
they're
talking
about
hours.
that
necessarily
involves
the
size
of
the
workforce,
does
it
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
only
possible;
it's
necessarily
true.
let's
assume
that
it's
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
--
let's
assume
that
it's
true,
that
a
union's
position
necessarily
affects
the
size
of
government.
is
not
the
size
of
government
a
question
on
which
there
are
fundamental
political
beliefs,
fundamental
convictions
that
are
being
sacrificed
if
a
nonunion
member
objects
to
this
line
of
policy?
are
there
not
other
union
proposals
that
say
--
that
state
employee's
salary
must
be
a
certain
percentage
of
the
total
state
expenditure?
does
this
not
also
involve
the
size
of
government,
which
is
a
fundamental
issue
of
political
belief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
talking
about
a
question
of
public
concern.
i'm
talking
about
whether
or
not
a
union
can
take
money
from
an
employee
who
objects
to
the
union's
position
on
fundamental
political
grounds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
--
i'm
asking
the
justification
for
that
under
the
first
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
an
era
where
government
is
getting
bigger
and
bigger,
and
this
is
becoming
more
and
more
of
an
important
issue
to
more
people.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
it's
a
fair
share,
but
that's
the
issue
in
the
case
if
you're
looking
at
the
legitimacy
of
abood.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you
say
it's
fair
share.
the
objectors
to
abood
say
that
it
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
young
person
thinks
that
the
state
is
squandering
his
heritage
on
unnecessary
and
excessive
payments
or
benefits
and
wages.
is
that
not
a
political
belief
of
the
highest
order?
and,
you
know,
we
talk
about
free
riders,
which
is
an
epithetical
phrase.
maybe
the
objecting
employee
would
say
that
the
union
is
a
speech
distorter;
it
is
taking
views
that
are
not
his
and
making
them
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining
and
charging
him
for
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
the
public
employees
must
surrender
a
substantial
amount
of
first
amendment
rights
to
work
for
the
government?
