justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
argument
dependent
on
this
being
sort
of
a
dual
employee
situation,
that
it's
reimbursement
as
opposed
to
policemen,
fire
--
police
people,
fire
people,
teachers,
other
public
--
other
public
employees
who
are
directly
employed
by
the
state?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
they
have
that
before
the
union?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
let's
break
this
down.
you're
not
arguing
that
there's
something
wrong
with
a
union
qua
union.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
state
saying,
we're
not
going
to
negotiate
with
any
employee
who's
not
a
member
of
the
union?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
problem
for
the
state
to
say
--
the
union,
to
organize,
has
a
certain
amount
of
costs.
so
putting
aside
fair
representation
laws,
could
the
state
say,
this
is
what
we're
going
to
pay
police
officers,
100
dollars,
but
we're
going
to
pay
union
members
110
to
reimburse
them
for
the
cost
of
negotiation.
would
that
be
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there's
no
problem
here
with
the
representation.
your
problem
is
with
the
fair
share?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
stops
the
non
--
the
people
who
oppose
the
union
policy
from
sending
a
letter,
asking
a
meeting,
expressing
their
disapproval
in
any
forum
they
want
and
in
any
way
they
want
to
whatever
policy
a
union
is
advocating?
is
there
anything
that
stops
them
from
doing
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
where's
the
first
amendment
abridgement?
they
can
do
whatever
they
want.
they
can
speak
however
they
want
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
to
absolutely
anything
the
union
is
doing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
here
for
your
employees?
they
negotiate
health
insurance.
do
they
--
they
don't
negotiate
termination
because
that's
up
to
the
individual--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--parties.
so
there's
no
grievance
committee.
do
they
negotiate
the
tasks
that
will
be
reimbursed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
you're
being
asked
to
have
a
fair
share
of
how
much
you're
getting
from
the
state
for
your
services
and
health
insurance.
what
else
is
negotiated
that
you're
being
asked
to
pay
for?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
if
your
adversary
says
that
the
reimbursement
rate
is
set
by
the
medicaid
program,
so
why
do
you
need
a
union
to
tell
you
how
much
to
pay
if
it's
already
set?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
smith,
i
think
that
there's
--
i
must
say
that
i
might
have
labored
under
it.
from
your
adversary's
statement,
it
appears
as
if
there's
a
belief
that
the
federal
government
sets
a
fixed
amount
and
that's
what
the
state
has
to
pay.
whether
the
federal
government
pays
you
a
certain
amount,
however,
you
seem
to
be
saying
the
state
can
go
above
that
amount
if
it
chooses.
that's
the
cooperative
nature
of
this.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
would
anybody
join
the
union
under
those
circumstances
or
pay
enough
to
support
the
union
efforts?
