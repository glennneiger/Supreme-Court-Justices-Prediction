i
think
this
is
all
being
sort
of
tied
up
together.
i
always
thought
foreseeability
and
proximate
cause
were
the
same.
i
think
the
issue
doesn't
do
with
either
foreseeability,
scope
of
risk,
or
proximate
cause.
it
has
to
do
with
what
you
started
with,
which
is
what's
the
level
of
factual
causation
that
we
want
to
set.
what
definition
are
we
going
to
give
for
the
legal
causation
standard.
and
you're
saying
that
it
has
to
be
but-for?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
let's
assume
that
we
are
troubled
by
the
examples
that
have
been
given.
if
two
people
or
three
people
come
together
and
each
puts
in
a
drop
of
blood,
either
knowing
that
only
one
drop
is
necessary
or
that
all
three
drops
are
necessary,
we
don't
want
to
let
that
person
off
because
it
doesn't
seem
logical,
okay?
what
would
save
your
case
in
it?
is
there
a
different
proximate
cause
standard
but
not
involving
but-for
that
would
still
get
you
what
you
are
looking
for?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
do
we
look
to
if
we
are
not
looking
to
causation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
does
it
matter
if
you
know
that
three
people
have
--
three
people
hate
someone
and
they
are
acting
independently,
each
one
intended
to
kill
the
guy
and,
you
know,
that
the
other
two
joined
in
was
lovely,
but
we
don't
know
which
drop
did
it.
we
don't
particularly
care,
do
we?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
no
conspiracy.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
can
we
save
this
case
if
there
is
no
conspiracy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
now
i'm
really
confused.
i
thought
you
were
pointing
the
causation,
the
factual
causation,
into
proximate
cause.
you
are
saying
there's
a
difference.
so
what
do
you
think
gets
folded
into
proximate
cause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
one
other
case
--
there
has
been
one
other
case,
but
you
are
suggesting
that
there
are
cases
in
which
there
might
be
a
proximate
cause
problem,
you
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
you
just
said
to
justice
kennedy.
in
what
other
case
have
we
said
that
you
don't
have
to
charge
a
jury
on
an
element
of
the
crime
on
proximate
causation?
is
there
any
in
which
we
have
ever
said
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
in
--
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
it
won't
be
a
problem.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
foreseeability--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
an
element
in
only
some
ways
of
killing
people,
in
which
some
people
die.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
know,
i'm
having
a
really
hard
time
because
of
carolene,
where
you
basically
admit
that
proximate
cause,
i.e.,
foreseeability,
because
i
see
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
almost
interchangeable,
is
almost
always
to
be
charged,
is
almost
always
an
element
that
is
required
when
you
have
a
