justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
part
of
your
argument
is
that
but-for
causation
isn't
sufficient,
right?
it
also
has
to
be
foreseeable.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
give
me
an
example
of
a
situation
where
a
heroin
dealer
deals
--
sells
drugs
to
somebody,
and
foresees
that
the
drugs
that
are
sold
will
cause
death?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
those
are
very
unusual
circumstances.
in
all
other
circumstances
where
somebody
is
just
selling
heroin
there
wouldn't
be
foreseeable,
so
the
statute
wouldn't
--
foreseeability;
the
statute
wouldn't
apply?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
compare
what
--
the
situation
that
justice
kagan
just
described
with
this
situation.
the
heroin
dealer
sells
a
user,
i
don't
know,
a
three-day
supply
or
four-day
supply,
whatever
it
is.
and
tells
the
--
the
user,
now,
you
should
only
use
this
much
per
day.
but
the
user
goes
off
and
injects
the
whole
amount
and
--
and
dies
as
a
result
of
an
overdose.
now,
why
would
congress
want
to
punish
that
person
where
the
overdose
--
where
the
heroin
sold
is
the
but-for
cause
of
death
and
not
the
situation
where
there's
the
--
the
multidrug
cocktail?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
that's
a
textual
argument
and
maybe
the
text
can
be
read
both
ways.
assuming
it
can
be
read
both
ways,
why
would
congress
want
to
attach
these
severe
consequences
in
the
overdose
case
and
not
in
the
drug
cocktail
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
this
foreseeability
test
would
work.
well,
you'd
have
testimony
what,
this
particular
user
looked
--
looked
like
a
healthy
person,
so
there
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
foreseeable
that
that
person
was
going
to
overdose.
this
other
one
looked
kind
of
shaky
and
irresponsible
and
who
knows
what
the
person
might
do.
that's
what
we
--
that's
what
the
jury
would
have
to
evaluate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
sort
of
facts?
suppose
you
--
you
have
the
heroin
dealer,
is
a
responsible
heroin
dealer.
[laughter]
and
he
wants
to
sell
heroin
but
doesn't
want
to
cause
anybody
to
die.
what
would
be
kind
of
the
checklist
that
the
person
would
go
through?
all
right,
i'm
going
to
sell
this.
i
take
the
risk
of
a
drug
conviction,
but
i
don't
want
this
death
results
business.
so
a
person
is
well
dressed.
person
is
--
what
would
be
the
factors?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
but
i
want
my
--
i
want
the
checklist
for
my
responsible
heroin
dealer
on
the
street
corner.
what
does
this
person
go
through?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
--
mr.
horwich,
before
we
leave
this
hypothetical--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--may
me
ask
you
this.
if
i
were
a
member
of
a
legislative
body
considering
what
i
would
want
to
happen
in
this
situation
--
it's
kind
of
a
frightening
thought.
but
if
that
were,
i
would
want
to
know
what
kind
of
testimony
medical
experts
can
reasonable
be
expected
to
provide
in
cases
like
this,
where
there
is
the
ingestion
of
multiple
drugs.
if
it
is
possible
in
most
cases,
many
cases,
all
cases,
a
high
percentage
of
cases,
for
them
to
break
this
down
probabilistically,
there
was
a
50
--
this
made
it
50
percent
more
likely,
90
percent
more
likely,
10
percent
more
likely,
i
might
want
to
go
down
that
road.
but
if
it's
not
reasonable
in
a
lot
of
these
cases
to
go
further
than
what
the
experts
did
in
this
case,
that
would
make
a
difference.
now,
can
you
tell
us
what,
realistically,
can
they
do
in
these
cases
where
there
is
the
ingestion
of
multiple
drugs
and
the
consequence
is
death?
