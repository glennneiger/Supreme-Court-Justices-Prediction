justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
said
--
the
statute
says
results,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
we're
asking
about
results.
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
he
gives
a
three-day
supply.
suppose
he
gives
a
year's
supply
and
he
overdoses
the
next
day,
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
that
a
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
suppose
we
go
back
to
justice
alito's
example
and
it's
just
a
two-day
supply
and
there
are
statistics
that
1
percent
of
heroin
users
overdose.
is
that
sufficient
to
establish
liability
under
your
foreseeability
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
what
the
legal
standard
is.
i'm
the
juror.
i
said
--
i
want
to
know
does
this
suffice
to
impose
liability?
and
you
say
well,
if
you
say
it
is.
does
it
or
doesn't
it?
that's
a
--
that's
a
fair
question.
just
--
you
can't
say,
oh,
well,
it's
up
to
the
jury.
we
don't
know.
i
want
to
know
what
the
rule
is.
the
juries
have
to
follow
a
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
just
want
to
get
your
position
as
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
let's
assume
1
percent
of
heroin
users
overdose.
dealer
sells
to
an
addict
he's
never
seen
before.
doesn't
know
anything
about
his
age,
background
or
anything.
just
sells
him
the
drug.
the
heroin
addict
overdoses.
liability
or
not?
can
there
be
liability
under
those
facts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
in
a
civil
context
--
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
civil
context,
you
have
strict
--
you
have
strict
liability.
this
is
in
a
way
strict
liability
and
seems
to
me
quite
proper.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
drug
company
if
it
--
if
it
doesn't
take
proper
steps,
it
is
liable
even
if
1
percent
of
the
users
are
adversely
affected.
excuse
me,
chief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
you
--
you're
saying
that
the
government's
position
is
that
contributing
factor
should
be
a
substantial
contributing
factor;
you're
happy
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
result
if
a
heroin
dealer
persuades
a
first
time
user
to
please
try
heroin,
it's
wonderful.
he
does.
three
days
later
the
addict,
the
new
addict,
the
new
user
buys
heroin
from
a
different
dealer
and
overdoses
and
dies?
does
the
first
dealer
contribute,
is
a
substantial
contributing
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
the
heroin
has
disappeared,
but
he
has
become
addicted.
