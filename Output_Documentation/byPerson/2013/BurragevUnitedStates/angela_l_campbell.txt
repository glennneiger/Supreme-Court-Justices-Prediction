ms.
angela
l.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
marcus
burrage
is
serving
a
20-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
selling
heroin
that,
according
to
the
jury
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
was
not
the
primary
cause
of
the
death,
but,
rather,
merely
played
a
part
in
the
death.
this
lesser
standard
of
contributing
causation
was
neither
articulated
by
congress
within
the
words
of
the
statute,
nor
was
it
generally
accepted
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
as
an
acceptable
version
of
causation.
congress's
selection
of
the
word
“
results
”
instead
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
traditional
notions
of
causation;
those
of
factual
cause
or
but-for
cause
and
proximate
cause.
now,
the
parties
don't
disagree
that
“
results
in
”
means
causation.
that
it's
a
causation
analysis.
and
regardless
of
whether
you
look
to
the
common
law
or
the
treatises
or
the
legal
commentators,
causation
triggers,
at
the
very
minimum,
a
but-for
causation
analysis.
in
this
particular
case,
but
for
the
use
of
the
heroin,
the
victim
would
not
have
died.
now,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
a
lesser
causation
standard,
one
that
expands
the
notion
of
but-for
causation.
but
if
we
instead
look
to
the
case
law
and
this
court's
precedent,
we
are
not
actually
trying
to
expand
but-for
causation
in
most
cases,
we
are
trying
to
limit
it.
because
but-for
causation
can
be
extrapolated
beyond
what
we
are
willing
to
give
liability
for.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
well,
i
would
disagree
with
the
premise
that
they
are
not
chargeable.
each
individual
person
that
put
the
drop
of
poison
in
that
cup
could
be
charged
with
attempted
murder
if
they
were
trying
to
kill
a
person.
but
under
standard
causation
analysis,
you
--
you
do
not
have
but-for
causation.
each
individual
drop
of
poison
was
not
the
but-for
causation
and
so
you
--
you
don't
have
causation.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
then--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--in
the
government's
--
in
the
government's
hypothetical,
each
person
individually
puts
in
one
drop
and
you
need
three
drops
in
order
to
--
to
kill
the
person.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
that
would
be
correct,
that
there
would
be
but-for
causation.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
well--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--that's--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--yes,
you
could
say
that.
and
that
--
and--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--it's
a
form
of
but-for
causation
that
i
think--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--it
--
it
can
be.
and
i
think
that
certain
--
that
specific
hypothetical,
while
it
warrants
special
consideration
by
this
court,
whether
or
not
in
criminal
context,
we're
going
to
expand
the
criminal
liability
to
that
is
not
this
case,
justice
scalia.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
correct.
if
there
is
a
hypothetical
that
changes
it
just
slightly,
you
would
not
have
but-for
causation
in
that
circumstance,
because
each
individual
drop
was
not
the
but-for
cause.
and
that's
more
like
our
hypothetical.
and,
again,
with
a
poison
hypothetical,
because
it's
an
intentional
act
by
the
defendant,
you
would
still
have
liability,
criminal
liability
for
attempt
or
assault
or
something
along
those
lines,
but
you
would
not
have
each
individual
person
liable
for
the
actual
death.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
correct.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
that
is
our
argument.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
well,
i
think
you
can
look
to
the
actual
case
law.
there
is,
for
those
types
of
hypotheticals,
when
the
heroin
dealer
is
actually
using
with
the
particular
purchaser
of
the
heroin
and
knows
that
he
is
overdosing.
if
the
heroin
dealer
is
the
one
injecting
the
drugs
into
the
system,
certainly
those
circumstances
are
foreseeable.
and
the
government--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--no,
i
disagree
with
that.
foreseeability
could
be
read
into
those
circumstances
where
you
simply
have
a
heroin
dealer
that
is
selling
heroin
and
you
would
take
that
foreseeability
question,
the
proximate
cause
question,
and
you
would
charge
it
to
the
jury.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
both
scope
in
the
risk
and
foreseeability
are
versions
of
saying
proximate
cause.
and
either
standard
in
this
circumstance
would
be
better
than
the
contributing
cause
standard
that
was
given
to
the
jury,
because
it
did
not
use
scope
of
the
risk
language.
it
didn't
use
foreseeability
language.
it
didn't
use
reasonably
probable--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--our
position
is
--
i
agree
with
you,
justice
sotomayor,
that
the
main
issue
is
this
but-for
causation
issue,
that
if
we
are
correct
that
but-for
causation
should
be
read
into
a
criminal
statute,
as
we
believe
it
should
under
these
circumstances
under
this
statute,
that
the
appropriate
question
is
whether,
but
for
the
heroin,
they
would
have
died.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
yes,
and
i
don't
think
you
need
to
look
to
causation
to
get
to
that
answer.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
well,
if
each
individual
person
in
the
poison
hypothetical
is
working
together
and
knows
about
the
other
people,
then
you
have
conspiracy
liability.
and
they
would
be
liable
for
the
actions
of
the
other
people
--
of
the
other
person
that
has
put
the
poison
in
and
you
can
still--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--in
that
particular
hypothetical
then
the--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--there's
no
conspiracy.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
then
you
have
attempt
liability,
and
those
people
would
still
all
be
criminally
liable
for
attempted
murder.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
yes,
justice
breyer,
there
is
an
answer
to
that.
the
hypotheticals
that
are
posed
by
professor
lafave,
which
is
the
one
that
you
are
citing,
actually
can
be
answered
by
the
use
of
the
substantial
factor
language.
now,
when
you
have
two
independently
sufficient
causes
which
act
upon
an
individual
causing
the
death,
you
have
a
but-for
problem
because
but
for
the
actor
a,
b's
blow
would
still
kill
the
person.
in
that
limited
circumstance,
the
common
law
already
addresses
that
and
you
use
the
substantial
factor
language,
which
we
did
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
tried
to
incorporate
into
our
jury
instruction,
which
was
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
and
so
that
is
limited
to
those
circumstances
where
you
have
two--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--that
is
our
position,
that
substantial
factor
is
appropriate
when
it
would
have
been
a
but-for
cause.
you
either
need
independently
sufficient
cause
or
but-for
causes
only
failing
by
another
independently
sufficient
cause.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
correct.
that
is
the
traditional
reason
why
you
would
use
the
substantial
factor
instruction.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
we
do
not
mean
it
to
go
any
further,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
case
law
or
the
treatises
take
it
any
further.
there
is
this
other
hypothetical--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--we
agree.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
you
could
under
the
common
use
of
the
word
“
substantial
factor
”,
but
at
least
“
substantial
factor
”
would
have
been
better
language
than
“
contributes
to
”
or
“
plays
a
part
in
”
that
this
jury
heard.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
it
would
at
least
give
us
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
the
heroin
was
not
the
substantial
factor
to
a
jury
in
a
factual
question
if
“
substantial
factor
”
does
not
mean
independently
sufficient
cause.
but
it's
our
position
that
at
the
time
of
the
passing
of
this
particular
provision,
“
substantial
factor
”
meant
to
address
the
circumstance
where
you
have
two
independently
sufficient
causes.
so
regardless
of
whether
you
use
“
substantial
factor
”
as
being
independently
sufficient
cause
or
some
other
sort
of
formulation
of
the
language
of
“
substantial
factor
”,
you
still
have
this
problem
that
the
jury
was
not
instructed
on
even
substantial
factor.
they
were
instructed
on
contributing
cause,
that--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--i
concede
that
in
a
heroin
case,
that
is
a
question
for
the
jury,
that
you
would
charge
foreseeability
or
proximate
cause
to
the
jury
in
those
circumstances.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
and
i
would
agree
that
that's
their
argument
and
that's
an
argument
that
should
be
presented
to
congress
to
amend
the
statute
to
incorporate
language
that
addresses
that.
congress
knows
how
to
address
a
contributing
cause
standard.
they
said
it
in
numerous
other
statutes
that
a
certain
act
contributes
to
a
death,
that
the
result
is
in
whole
or
in
part
a
result
of
the
defendant's
action.
they've
said
it.
they
know
how
to
say
it
and
they
could
say
it
again
in
this
statute
if
they
wanted
to.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
well,
in
the
absence
of
language
to
the
contrary,
this
statute
actually
says,
the
use
of
this
substance,
the
substance
sold
by
the
defendant
results
in
a
death.
and
so
when
we
start
by
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute,
they
--
they
don't
say
these
common
words
that
you
could
use
to
encompass
those
circumstances.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
because
congress
would
want
to
target
a
situation
where
there
has
been
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant's
actions
were
the
cause
of
the
death.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
that
would
be
true.
and
what
i
was
addressing
in
justice
--
the
justice's
hypothetical
was
that
you
can't
read
congressional
intent
into
the
selection
of
the
words
within
this
statute.
and
if
congress
intended
to
punish
multiple
drug
cocktails
all
equally,
they
would
instead
have
written
the
statute
to
address
the
cocktail.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
correct.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
i
believe
that
would
be
a
jury
question.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
it
would
be
if
he
takes
the
heroin,
and
the
heroin
is
the
cause
of
the
death,
then,
yes,
it's
a
but-for
cause.
we
would
then
add
that
you
should
have
a
proximate
cause
analysis,
which
is
the
juries
are
in
--
in
a
unique
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
foreseeability
is
appropriate
in
that
circumstance.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
not
as
a
matter
of
law
and
not
to
the
degree
that
the
solicitor
general
urges
that
it's
a
per
se
foreseeability.
foreseeability
is
still
always
going
to
be
instructed
to
the
jury
in
that
circumstance.
and
they
can
argue
that
certainly
1
percent
is
sufficient,
and
the
defense
can
argue
1
percent
chance
is
not
sufficient
and
can
attack
the
--
the
numbers.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
the
rule
is
the
language
of
the
proximate
cause
instruction
that
you
give
them.
and
while
there
are
different
formulations
of
that
proximate
cause
instruction,
you
would
instruct
the
jury
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
the
defendant
would
be
able
to
foresee
that
consequence.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
well,
in
that
circumstance,
in
our
specific
factual
circumstance,
each
individual
person
that
supplied
any
of
the
drugs
to
the
victim
in
this
case
would
be
equally
liable.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
selling
sleeping
pills
can
be
illegal
if
they're
sold
to
someone
that
does
not
have
a
prescription,
if
they're
sold
on
the
street.
the
oxycontin
that
was
used
in
this
case
was
not
procured
legally.
the
marijuana
in
this
case
was
not
procured
legally.
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
whether
or
not
the
other
prescription
drugs,
the
multitude
of
prescription
drugs
he
had
in
his
house
were
procured
legally.
so
assuming
that
the
conduct
of
the
person
distributing
the
drugs
were
each
individually
violating
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
it
would
be
equally
liable
under
the
theory
that
they
only
had
to
contribute
to
the
death
of
the
individual.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
there
are
certain
facts
that
could
be
read
to
a
jury.
in
each
individual
case,
they
would
differ.
and
you
can
look
at
the
case
law,
especially
regarding
this--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--well,
i
think
you
could
look
directly
to
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
macintosh
case
and
the
factors
in
that
case
where
that
particular
person
manufactured
methamphetamine
and
specifically
said,
i
do
not
want
my
methamphetamine
to
go
to
this
person.
none
of
the
meth
should
go
to
this
person.
but
his
meth
ended
up
going
to
that
person
and
that
person
overdosed
and
died.
in
that
circumstance,
that
would
be
a
fact
that
we
could
argue
to
the
jury
on
the
defendant's
behalf
using
the
appropriate
proximate
cause
standard
that
that
was
not
foreseeable
and
not
intended--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--well,
i
--
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
checklist.
that's
why
proximate
cause
and
foreseeability
is
always
charged
to
a
jury.
why
it's
--
it's
uniquely
a
jury
question.
whether
there's
an
experience
with
this
particular
user,
whether
the
person
that
is
selling
the
drugs
knows
the
user
has
overdosed
in
the
past,
whether
there's
something
within
that
particular
drug
that
is
stronger
than
normal
heroin.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
that
reflect
that.
the
evidence
within
the
record
indicates
that
this
particular
user
was
an
experienced
heroin
user
and
that
people
who
use
heroin
on
a
--
on
a
regular
basis
actually
develop
tolerance
to
heroin,
so
it
would
take
a
higher
amount
of
heroin
for
that
person
to
overdose.
that's
what's
in
the
record.
now,
the
--
the
studies
that
are
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
indicate
that
there
have
been
some
sort
of
research
--
we
don't
have
access
to
all
of
those
documents
--
but
some
sort
of
research
regarding
heroin
addicts.
and
--
and
when
you're
dealing
with
heroin
addicts,
that
number
is
less
than
1
percent
using
their
--
their
research.
heroin
addicts
are
less
than
1
percent
likely
to
die.
those
types
of
factors
could
be
used
in
formulating
a
foreseeability
analysis.
but,
of
course,
you
can't
just
rely
on
the
foreseeability
analysis,
you
should
always
incorporate
this
but-for
analysis.
and
in
a
but-for
analysis,
you
would
also
be
dealing
with
a
situation
where
you
have
multiple
drugs.
and
so
it
not
only
informs
our
discussion
about
whether
or
not
the
heroin
was
the
but-for
cause
of
the
death,
but
also
whether,
in
this
particular
circumstance,
this
particular
defendant
could
foresee
that
this
particular
person--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--it
would
be
our
position
that
there
could
be
liability
if
properly
instructed
to
a
jury.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
correct.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
we
disagree.
and,
justice
scalia,
i
would
point
actually
to
the
--
this
court's
precedent
in
the
civil
context
where
you
--
you
read
proximate
cause
and
foreseeability
into
almost
exact
same
language.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
in
a
civil
context,
when
it's
explicit--
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
--you
--
in
a
strict
liability
circumstance
would
have
a
statute
which
writes
in
strict
liability.
this
statute
doesn't
write
in
strict
liability.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
only
in
the
circumstance
where
you
have
two
independently
sufficient
causes
do
you
--
do
you
reach
that
question.
we
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
that
question
here.
that's
why
we
didn't
argue
that
at
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
stage,
because
you
don't
have
standard
but-for
causation.
and
that
failure
was
not
as
a
result
of
two
independently
sufficient
causes.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
the
--
that's
the
primary
argument,
that
except
for
the
heroin
that
--
the
factual
basis
of
this
case
is
that,
if
you
remove
the
heroin,
the
doctors
are
saying
he
still
might
have
died.
and
that
is
what
defeats
the
but-for
causation.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
thank
you.
ms.
angela
l.
campbell
it's
our
position
that
but-for
cause
is
the
first
question,
and
only
when
you
reach
a
point
where
there
is
no
but-for
cause
do
you
then
go
on
to
say,
is
this
one
of
these
circumstances
where
there
is
a
--
two
independently
sufficient
harms.
if
no,
end
of
question,
which
was
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
time
of
trial.
there
was
no
but-for
cause.
we
made
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
but-for
cause.
you
don't
need
to
make
that
inquiry
in
this
particular
case.
there
may
be
cases
where
you
make
that
inquiry.
of
course,
we
didn't
win,
so
we
had
to
keep
going
along,
and
we
asked
for
a
substantial
factor
test
because
we
thought
maybe
we
could
influence
the
judge
to
give
us
a
better
instruction,
like
the
substantial
factor
test
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
already
approved,
and
he
rejected
it
and
gave
them
a
contributing
cause
instruction,
which
is
clearly
not
encompassed
within
the
common
law
standards
of
causation.
but-for
cause
is
substantial
factor.
now,
to
address
the
concerns
about
letting
defendants
go
free,
that
just
simply
doesn't
play
a
part
in
this
analysis.
every
criminal
defendant
in
any
of
these
hypotheticals
would
have
some
sort
of
criminal
liability,
either
a
lesser
included
offense.
this
particular
defendant,
mr.
burrage,
could
go
to
prison
for
20
years
for
the
lesser
included
offense.
you
have
accomplice
liability.
you
have
conspiracy.
you
have
attempt.
all
of
these
individuals
are
going
to
be
punished.
you
have
sentencing
discretion.
the
judge
can
look
at
the
fact
that
there
was
a
death
--
well,
maybe
not
a
primary
cause
in
the
death
--
there
was
a
death,
and
enhance
the
sentence
under
the
--
beyond
the
guideline
range.
all
of
those
concerns
are
already
addressed
in
the
criminal
law,
and
we
do
not
need
to
change
the
criminal
law
of
causation
and
relax
it
to
encompass
more
harms.
because
if
we
aren't
willing
to
do
that
in
a
civil
context
where
you
have
contributing
negligence
and
shifting
of
burdens
of
--
shifting
of
the
costs
in
having
--
your
hypothetical,
you
have
different
percentages'
likelihood
of
causing
the
harm.
so
maybe
you
give
5
percent
to
the
marijuana
dealer
and
10
percent
to
the
oxycodone
dealer
and
20
percent
to
the
heroin
dealer.
we
don't
have
that
in
criminal
law.
that's
a
--
that's
a
policy
consideration
that
is
different
between
civil
law
and
criminal
law.
in
criminal
law,
the
person's
going
to
go
to
prison
under
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
and
in
some
cases
for
life
with
no
parole
based
on
this
relaxed
causation
standard
that
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
incorporate
into
a
statute
where
it
doesn't
say
it.
and
so
we
would
respectfully
ask
for
the
court
not
to
engage
in
that
process,
not
to
relax
causation
for
the
criminal
--
criminal
statute
at
play
here
and
in
all
of
the
criminal
statutes
that
use
“
result
in
”,
and
instead
rely
upon
the
general
notions
of
causation
that
are
already
established
in
the
law.
thank
you.
