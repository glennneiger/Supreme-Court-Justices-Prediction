the
model
penal
code,
the
brown
commission,
everybody
says
this
is
a
famous
law
school
hypothetical,
i
thought
you
would
never
find
it
in
reality.
they
say
certainly
there
is
liability
where
two
people
strike,
each
strikes
a
mortal
blow
independently,
and
everyone
seems
to
agree
there
is
liability
there.
and
even
though
no
blow
--
neither
blow
is
in
fact
a
but-for
condition,
because
in
the
absence
of
blow
a
he
would
be
dead
anyway
from
blow
b.
all
right.
so
we
start
with
that,
i
thought.
and
now
starting
with
that
--
you
can
say
i
don't
want
to
start
with
that.
i
think
that
all
professor
wechsler
and
professor
hall
and
all
these
people
famous
in
my
day
were
wrong.
okay.
that's
up
to
you.
but
if
you
do
take
that
as
a
basic
assumption,
then
how
do
you
win?
i
think
that
was
the
question,
and
there
may
be
an
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
accept
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
--
here
i
accept
that
--
first
of
all,
there's
no
problem
with
intent
for
me
for
the
reason
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
that
anyone
who
sells
heroin
to
someone
is
reckless,
at
least,
in
respect
to
the
possibility
of
a
death
resulting.
so
i
think
that's
enough
to
bring
them
within
the
intent
problem.
also,
there
was
a
death
here;
fine.
but
still
you
have
to
show
cause.
and
this
is
this
unusual
situation,
which
the
brown
commission
expresses
itself
upon
and
which
the
model
penal
code
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
model
penal
code
did
express
itself
on
what
they
call,
in
the
brown
commission,
concurrent
causes,
all
right?
it
has
to
be
a
but-for
or
a
concurrent
cause.
but
a
concurrent
cause
is
the
situation
where
there
are
two
people
striking
a
mortal
blow.
therefore,
either
is
sufficient.
and
if,
in
fact,
the
second
wasn't
sufficient,
then
the
first
is
a
necessary
condition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
so
here
we
have
the
separate
problem
which
has
been
pointed
out
that
not
only
--
we
don't
know
if
the
others
were
sufficient,
nor
do
we
know
if
this
was
a
necessary
condition.
and
brown
and
5
states
tell
you
what
to
do
in
such
situation
to
fall
within
the
definition
of
cause.
and
the
model
penal
code
where
you
have
professor
wechsler
debating
professor
hall
with
dean
griswald
throwing
in
the
odd
comment
decided
not
to
tell
us
its
view.
okay?
so
that's
where
i
stand.
and
you
can
correct
that
if
you
want,
but
i'm
beginning
to
think
that
probably,
at
least
it
should
be
important
in
such
a
situation,
and
that
the
word
“
substantial
”
better
connotes
the
idea
of
it
being
an
important
factor
than
the
word
“
contributing
”,
which
means
picks
up
all
kinds
of
quite
unimportant
factors.
that's
where
my
thinking
is,
and
anything
--
i
just
say
that
in
case
you
want
to
respond
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it
doesn't
say
--
the
one
they
quote
in
their
brief,
all
they
wanted
the
judge
to
say
was
it
could
be
--
they
say,
you
are
right,
proximate
cause,
but
they're
interested
here
in
is
it
a
cause
at
all.
and
they
say:
"as
long
as
the
subject
cause
contributes
substantially
to
producing
the
death.
"
that's
what
they
wanted
him
to
say.
and
he
didn't
say
it.
and
actually
when
i
read
that,
i
thought,
well,
what
they
want
is
to
say
that
it's
an
important
factor,
rather
than
just
saying
it's
some
unimportant
factor.
and
they
seem,
i
don't
know
what
these
words
really
mean,
but
it
seems
they
are
closer
to
what
you're
saying
should
be
the
law
than
you
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
want
us
to
say?
you
know
what's
actually
worrying
me
about
this
case?
it
took
quite
a
long
time,
and
there
are
like
three
levels
of
complexity,
and
we
are
from
but
for
into
concurrent
and
then
the
sufficient
condition
and
the
necessary
condition.
and
we
are
trying
to
argue
whether
this
thing
that
the
model
penal
code
wouldn't
even
pick
up
in
brown
ought
to
be
the
federal
law
of
the
united
states.
and
professor
wechsler's
reaction
was:
look,
this
is
--
this
going
to
arise
so
infrequently,
it's
so
complicated
to
talk
about,
that
you
are
going
to
mix
everybody
up
once
we
start
to
write
on
this.
and
that
is
worrying
me
as
a
real
problem.
once
i
start
to
write
in
this
area,
we
are
going
to
get
people
so
mixed
up
no
matter
what
we
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
i
hesitate
to
go
backwards
from
the
very
vague
and
open
language,
substantive,
substantial
versus
contributing,
and
just
sort
of
why
not
just
say
substantial
and
leave
it
there
and
let
the
lower
courts
figure
it
out,
so
we
don't
confuse
the
entire
bar
and
the
entire
congress
and
everything.

stephen
g.
breyer
