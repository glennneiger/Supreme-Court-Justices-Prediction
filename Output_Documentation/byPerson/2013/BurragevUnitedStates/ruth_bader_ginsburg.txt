how
would
you
respond
to
the
hypothetical
that
the
government
poses
on
24
of
its
brief,
that
it's
the
three
drops
of
poison,
each
defendant
puts
in
one
drop,
one
drop
will
not
do
it,
three
drops
will,
and
none
of
them
would
be
chargeable
because
it
takes
three
drops?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
three
--
three
drops.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
agree
that,
that
an
overdose
--
there
is
a
foreseeable
risk
that
someone
who
purchases
heroin
will
overdose,
there
is
a
foreseeable
risk
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
was
--
the
heroin
was
illegal
--
was
not
--
the
selling
of
a
sleeping
pill
is
not
illegal.
it's
perfectly
lawful.
selling
heroin
is
illegal.
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
clarify
before
you're
finished.
you
have
used
the
words
“
foreseeability
”,
“
but
for
”.
are
you
saying,
to
make
it
very
simple,
that
unless
the
government
proves
that
the
heroin
independently
would
cause
death,
then
no
conviction?
the
heroin
must
independently
cause
the
death.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
are
you
then
saying
except
for
the
heroin
ingestion,
the
death
would
not
have
occurred?
