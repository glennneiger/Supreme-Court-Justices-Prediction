chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-7515,
burrage
v.
united
states.
ms.
campbell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
would
if
--
if
you
knew
that
there
were
two
drops
in
and
you
added
the
third
drop
after
the
two
drops.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i've
lost
sight
of
this.
is
this
each
drop
is
enough
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
takes
three.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
well,
there's
but-for
causation
when
you
are
the
third
person.
your
drop
caused
the
death,
and
the
death
would
not
have
been
caused
without
your
drop.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any
--
what
type
of
heroin
user
is
more
likely
to
overdose
and
suffer
death?
a
first-time
heroin
user
or
an
experienced
heroin
user?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
in
the
civil--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
one
little
--
one
little
grain
of
heroin
that
you
discover
is
in
the
body,
and
that
person's
going
away
for
whatever
it
is,
20
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
wanted
to
incorporate
in
the
statute
your
friend's
understanding
of
but-for
cause,
what
word
would
you
use
that
would
be
better
than
“
results
”?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
you
want
--
you
want
a
word
that's
going
to
be
readily
understandable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
horwich,
just
if
i
could
get
back,
that
is
the
instruction
on
proximate
cause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
but-for
cause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
get
back
to
it,
you
were
reading
from
the
proximate
cause
instruction.
they've
got
--
the
very
next
instruction
says:
you
have
to
find
that
he
died
as
a
result
of
using
the
heroin
distributed
by
the
defendant.
so
i
think
it's
a
little
unfair
to
suggest
that
they
were
willing
to
go
with
the
same
concept
of
cause
that
you
were
proposing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem
with
your
hypothetical,
it's
the
sort
of
thing
where
there's
no
way
that
a
doctor
could
say
three
people
beat
the
guy
up,
which
one
threw
the
fatal
punch.
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
experts
could
tell
you:
yes,
the
heroin
alone
would
have
killed
him.
or,
as
in
this
case,
i
can't
tell
you
the
heroin
alone
would
have
killed
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
can't
put
--
but
my
point
is
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
tell
you
in
any
case,
where
here
they
can
tell
you
in
every
case
whether
it's
clear
that
the
heroin
caused
the
death
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
this
statute
does
not
say
if
you
die
from
taking
drugs,
then
the
person
who
gave
you
drugs,
who
gave
you
any
kind
of
drug
is
responsible.
it
says
the
heroin
has
to
result,
death
has
to
result
from
the
heroin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
you
give
the
guy
a
heroin
and
he
drives
away,
but
as
a
result
of
using
it
he's
driving
under
the
influence,
has
an
accident
and
is
killed?
is
that
--
does
his
death
result
from
the
heroin
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
campbell,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
