mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
situation
here
is
very
much
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
sought
to
hold
drug
traffickers
responsible
for
the
results
of
the
use
of
the
dangerous
substances
in
which
they
deal.
it's
perfectly
ordinary
to
speak
of
a
drug
as
contributing
to
an
overdose.
and
in
the
context
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
there
is
no
room
to
argue
that
a
heroin
user's
overdose
death
comes
as
a
surprise.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
let
me
explain,
because
i
think
the
concern
that
arises
with
your
hypothetical,
which
doesn't
arise
on
these
facts,
presents
a
different
issue
than
what's
in
dispute
before
the
court
right
now.
the
dispute
between
the
parties
is
what
kinds
of
--
on
the
causation
in
fact
side
of
the
case,
the
dispute
is
between
what
kinds
of
causes
can
qualify
at
all.
do
they
have
to
be
but-for
causes
or
can
a
contributing
cause
count?
now,
there
is
a
separate
principle
which
is
reflected
in
jury
instructions
and
reflected
in
the
substantial
factor
concept
and
so
forth
that
causes
that
are
causes
in
fact
but
are
too
insignificant
or
not
important
enough
or
too
insubstantial
are
not
properly
the
basis
for
criminal
responsibility.
now,
that's
--
that's
not
the
dispute
before
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
--
i
think
probably
yes,
although
let
me
--
let
me
explain
that
we
--
why
we
see
the
nature
of
the
expert
testimony
as
actually
different
than
what
you're
describing
there.
because--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
the
expert
testimony
in
this
case,
but
in
general
what
experts
are
testifying
to
when
they're
testifying
to
that.
they
are
not
testifying
to
some
uncertainty
about
whether
the
defendant's
drugs
played
any
role
at
all.
this
isn't
the
question
of
say,
yeah,
he
bought
heroin
from
two
different
dealers.
he
took
one
of
them,
and
he
died,
but
we
don't
know
which
dealer
it
was.
in
that
case
we
totally
agree
that
that
sort
of
uncertainty
means
no
liability.
what
the
experts
testified
to
in
these
cases
is
that
the
primary
cause
of
death,
which
is
essentially
central
nervous
system
depression
that
leads
to
asphyxiating
on
stomach
contents
or
saliva
or
something
like
that,
was
a
process
to
which
a
number
of
substances
contributed.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
experts
here
of
course
did
testify
specifically
that
the
heroin
did
contribute
to
the
death.
so--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
guess
--
maybe
i
can
respond
to
that
with
a
perhaps
more
conventional
hypothetical.
if
you
imagine
that
--
if
you
imagine
that
you
have
three
assailants
who
independently
simultaneously
set
upon
the
victim
and
beat
him
to
death,
and
the
victim
could
have
survived
any
one
of
them.
in
that
situation,
you
might
well
have
testimony
from
a
doctor
that
says,
well,
i
can't
tell
you
--
he
probably
would
have
died
--
even
i
can
be
sure
he
would
have
died
from
the
other
two
guys.
but
i
think
in
that
--
in
that
scenario
we
would
certainly
recognize
that
the
--
that
each
of
the
assailants
is
responsible
for
the
victim's
death.
we
wouldn't
say
oh,
well,
he--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
don't
think
--
the
experts
here
did
not
testify
in
probability
figures
in
that
way.
what
they
testified
to
was
that
--
was
that
the
heroin
contributed
to
the
set
of
drugs
that
were
responsible
for
the
actual
primary
cause
of
death.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
that
--
and
it
is
that
aspect
of
the
testimony
which
is
why
we
concede
that
if
you
apply
a
but-for
test,
that
testimony
does
not
establish
a
but-for
test.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it's
not
a--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--the
relevant
question
is
in
a
contributing
cause
analysis,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
setting
aside
the
substantiality
question
that
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
raised,
the
basic
question
of
the
contributing
cause
analysis
is
whether
the
drug
in
a
case
like
this
contributed
to
the
physio
--
the
internal
physiological
effects
that
culminated
in
the
death.
and
i
would
make
a
distinction
here,
for
example.
if
you
--
consider
the
marijuana
in
this
case.
the
testimony
here
does
not
even
establish
the
marijuana
as
being
a
contributing
cause,
because
the
toxicologists
--
the
toxicologist
testifies
--
this
is
at
joint
appendix
193,
that
the
--
"every
drug
on
this
list,
with
the
exception
of
the
constituents
of
marijuana,
have
central
nervous
system
depressant
effects.
"
and
then
goes
on
to
explain
why
it's
those
effects
that
are
--
that's
what's
going
on
in
the
body
that's
leading
to
the
death.
so
again
--
so
we
would
agree
that
if
you
apply
--
that
if
you
insist
on
a
but-for
test,
then,
correct,
these
sort
of
probabilities
don't
get
the
government
even
to
the
jury.
that's
a
directed
verdict.
but
i
want
to
--
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
though
--
so
i
guess
what
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
why
the
but-for
test
is
not
the
right
test
to
be
applying
here.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
--
i
can't
represent
to
be
informed
enough
about
sort
of
the
range
of
cases,
but
i
think
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
actually
informative
on
that
point,
because
there
are
a
number
of
uncertainties
to
which
the
--
the
--
the
experts
testified
that
show
why
it
is,
from
--
why
it
is,
from
their
point
of
view,
essentially
impossible
to
disentangle
the
effect
of
one
drug
and
another
drug
when
they're
having
the
same
effect
on
the
body.
they're
doing
the
same
thing
to
the
--
the
victim's
central
nervous
system.
and
so,
it
is
--
it's
the
sort
of
thing
that
it's
meaningless
to
speak
of
one
drug
versus
the
other
as
being
“
the
cause
”,
because
they're
all
in
the
body,
they're
all
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
same
way
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
we
--
we--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
we
--
we
would
take
congress
to
have
been
incorporating
the
rules
settled
on
generally
in
the
criminal
context--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--for
this
sort
of
problem.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
we
do
take
it
to
mean
causes.
but
courts
applying
the
concept
of
cause
--
so
that's
why
we
think
that
congress
would
be
intending
to
borrow
courts'
approaches
to
causation
in
common
law
cases.
and
i
think
there's
a
key
insight
in
those
cases.
now,
we
cite
a
number
of
them
going
back
100,
120
years
in
our
--
in
our
brief
at
pages
19
and
20,
21,
25
and
26.
and
the
key
insight
in
those
cases,
which
i
think
justice
sotomayor
touched
on,
which
is
that
if
your
test
for
causation,
say
a
but-for
test,
is
producing
a
result
in
a
case
that
nothing
and
nobody
was
the
cause
of
the
victim's
death,
you
need
to
rethink
your
test
for
causation.
it's
not
producing
sound
results.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
and
so,
justice
breyer,
that's
what's
going
on
in
--
in
the
treatises
that
then
say,
well,
in
these
other
cases,
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to
say,
well,
these
independently
sufficient
tests,
that
applies
as
well.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
do.
i
have,
i
think,
two
very
important
things
to
say
in
response
to
that.
one
of
them
is,
as
--
as
i
was
sort
of
suggesting
with
the
chief
justice,
if
the
dispute
is
over
whether
it
should
be
a
substantial
contributing
cause,
then
i
think
we're
happy
to
argue
that
the
jury
instruction
gets
in
that
direction,
and
at
a
minimum,
there's
harmless
error
here.
so--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
it's
not
what
--
it's
not
what
we
mean--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
would
point
out
--
i
would
point
out
that
--
i
mean,
i'm
reading
from
the
washington
state
christman
decision,
which
is
the
only
decision
that
the
parties
have
cited
that's
actually
--
factually
deals
with
this
scenario
and
it
says,
"under
the
substantial
factor
test,
all
parties
whose
actions
contributed
to
the
outcome
are
held
liable.
"
so
i
think
that's
--
that's
very
much
in
line
with
what
we're
saying.
i'd
also
say
that
the
brown
commission
and
those--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
because
we
think
it
does
--
we
think
it
does
have
to
be
substantial.
i
think
that's
--
that's
why
the
word
“
substantial
”--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
all
parties
whose
actions
substantially
contributed
to
the
outcome.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
think
--
i
think
we
would
not
--
we
wouldn't
have
an
objection
if
the
court
states
that
as
the
law.
now,
if
the
court
does
that,
it
would
be
appropriate,
i
suppose,
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
examine
the
record
here.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
substantial--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--substantial
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
--
well,
i
would
put
it
in
relative
terms,
right?
the
question
would
be:
is
this
cause
substantial
relative
to
what?
well,
relative
to
the
other
causes
at
issue.
and
we
have
here
overwhelming
testimony
that
the
heroin--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
we
know
that
it
can
--
we
know
two
things;
one,
it
causally
contributed
in
a
way
that,
say,
the
marijuana
did
not
contribute
to
what
the
experts
are
testifying
was
the
physiological
process.
and
two--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--of
the
things
that
contributed
to
that,
we
would
agree
that
the
insubstantial,
the
one
pill
out
of
a
thousand
hypothetical,
would
certainly
not
be
substantial.
how
substantial,
i
guess,
is
going
to
be
very
fact-specific.
here
it's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
disagree
with
that.
because
what
we're
asking
the
jury
to
decide
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
did
this
drug
have
the
physiological
effects
that
the
medical
examiners
described
as
being
the
integral
process
that
resulted
in
death.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
--
i
think
that
there
is
going
to
be
testimony
about
probabilities
and
likelihoods
that
will
inform
the
substantiality
question,
but
it's
not
a
question
of
likelihood
that
it
--
that
it
contributed
to
the
central
nervous
system
depression
that
killed
the
victim
here.
that
--
that
is
unequivocal
in
the
testimony.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
would
--
you
could
use
but
for
or
accept.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
or
solely.
i
guess
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
--
the
jury
instructions
that
petitioner
proposed
here,
which
are
on
238,
which
say
that,
that
the
--
the
proximate
cause
must
be
one
that
except
for
the
cause
the
death
would
not
have
occurred.
that's
the
instructions
that
are
proposed
there.
and
our
point
is
that
the
insight
in
--
in
these
sources,
it's
an
insight
that's
in
the
brown
commission
report,
it's
an
insight
that's
in
the
numerous
cases
we
have
cited
going
back,
is
that
that
is
not
the
only
test
that
is
used.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
the
way
they
are
structured
for
--
in
petitioner's
submission,
it's
--
it's
sort
of
built
into
the
proximate
cause
instruction.
they
weren't
separated
in
the
way
petitioner
did
it.
so
there's
--
the
first
part
of
the
second
sentence
on
238,
the
"direct
result
or
reasonably
probable
consequence.
"
gets
at
what
we
would
more
conventionally
describe
as
proximate
cause.
but
the
second
part
is
classic
causation
in
fact:
"except
for
the
cause
the
death
would
not
have
occurred.
"
so
what
petitioner
here
is
trying
to
defend
is
a
test
that
produces--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
is
a
convenient
excerpt
from
the
instruction
on
238,
but
the
other
part
of
the
instruction
insists
that
except
for
the
cause
the
death
would
not
have
occurred.
so--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
certainly,
certainly
they
can
pull
up
cases
that
say
that.
but
what
i
would
emphasize
for
this
court
is
that
in
four
briefs
to
this
court
petitioner
has
not
cited
a
single
case
that
does
what
he's
asking
this
court
to
do,
which
is
reject
a
contributing
cause
approach
and
exonerate
him
under
a
but-for
test
that
applied
to
this
case
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
and
nobody
caused
the
victim
to
die
here.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
we
wouldn't
--
we
don't
disagree
that
a
court
could
just
use
the
unadorned
statutory
language.
that
--
that
--
that
would
not
be
error
to
do
so.
our
point
is
only
--
our
point
is
only
that
a
contributing
cause,
as
these
courts
have
recognized
for
a
long
time,
can
be
a
cause
in
fact,
particularly
in
these
scenarios
where
otherwise
they
are
going
to
conclude
there
was
no
cause
at
all.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
if
your
honor
is
concerned
about
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
think
you
could
write
a
decision
that
says
the
right
instruction
here
is
substantial
factor.
the
test
--
the
cause
does
not
have
to
be
a
but-for
test,
but
we
are
not
going
to
go
on
to
define
“
substantial
factor
”.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
this
isn't
--
i
think
this
isn't
something
that
would
catch
congress
by
surprise.
the
problem
of
multiple
drug
use
is
a
well
recognized
situation.
if
i
might
turn
to
foreseeability.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
situations
that
we're
talking
about
here
are
ones
in
which
nothing
would
be
a
for
cause
of
the
death
and
nothing
would
be
independently
sufficient
to
cause
the
death.
so
in
some
sense--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
disagree
with
that.
it
absolutely
played
a
role
in
causing
it.
that's
exactly
what
the
toxicologist--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that's
true.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
that's
true,
but
i
don't
think,
to
take
my
example
of
the
assailants,
the
three
assailants
beating
the
victim
to
death,
i
think
it
would
be
very
strange
to
say
that
none
of
those
assailants
played
a
role
in
the
victim
dying,
none
of
them
contributed
to
the
victim
dying.
that
seems
--
that
seems
to
be
contrary
to
ordinary
usage
and
ordinary
intuitions
about
cause
and
effect.
now,
i
agree
in
this
situation
because
we
are
talking
about
something
that
happens
at
a
molecular
level,
it's
perhaps
less
--
it's
less
part
of
common
experience
and
we
have
to
rely
on
the
doctors.
but
what
they
are
saying
is
no
different
than
saying
that
he
had
three
drugs
in
there
and
they
were
each
knocking
him
down
to
a
state
of
unable
to
--
to
repress
his
gag
reflex,
essentially.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
can
imagine
a
doctor
similarly
testifying
in
the
three
assailants
situation
to
exactly
that
point.
i
can't
tell
you
which
is
the
fatal
punch,
precisely.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
that
may
be
true,
but
there
will
be
cases
in
which
no
single
drug
caused
the
death
and
yet
the
victim
died.
that's
what
produces
the
problem
here.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it
does.
and
i
think
it's
ordinarily
--
i
think
it's
an
ordinary
usage
of
language
to
describe
this
as
resulting
from
the
heroin
and
some
other
things,
too.
but
the
testimony
is
certainly
to
the
effect
that
it
resulted
from
the
heroin.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
contributing
cause
there?
i
guess
--
i
guess
i
would
need
to
know
more
medically.
i
suspect
that
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
okay.
so
he's
become
addicted.
i
think
possibly
yes.
i
am
skeptical
that
that
would
be
a
substantial
contributing
cause.
and
then
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
in
our
view
questions
about
proximate
cause
that
would
be
raised
in
that
situation
as
well.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
we
think
in
that
situation,
certainly
factually,
causation
in
fact,
it
does.
in
that
situation
we
are
lying
farther
away
from
the
central
harms
that
the
controlled
substances
act
is
addressing,
and
so
we
think
you
would
get
into
some
sort
of
proximate
cause
inquiry
there
as
well,
that
you
wouldn't
here.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
so
in
proximate
cause,
our
basic
point
on
proximate
cause
in
an
overdose
situation
is
that
you
already
have
the
indicia
you
need
to
know
that
this
is
the
harm
for
which
congress
wants
to
hold
the
defendant
responsible.
in
the
chief
justice's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--absolutely.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
--
i
have
to
disagree
with--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
guess
i
have
to
--
i
guess
my
answer
to
your
hypothetical
has
to
be
to
disagree
with
the
idea
that
this
is
an
element.
we're
not
dispensing
with
an
element.
the
element
is
that
a
death
resulted.
the
question
is
how,
in
a
particular
case,
should
a
district
judge
explicate
the
scope
of
harms
for
which
defendants
should
be
held
responsible?
and
sometimes
you
can
do
that
with
a
foreseeability
instruction.
sometimes
you
might
do
it
with
an
intervening
or
superseding
cause
instruction
or
other
proximate
cause
concepts.
but
in
a
case
where
you
know
there's
an
overdose
at
issue,
and
we're
talking
about
heroin
here,
which
is
controlled,
in
large
part,
precisely
because
it
kills
people--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--you
don't
need--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--it
is
necessary
to
instruct
on
it
if
we're
in
a
situation
where
we're
worried
about
consequences
running
out
to
infinity.
that's
the
usual
concern,
the
palsgraf-type
concern
about
foreseeability,
but
this
is
not
running
out
to
infinity.
this
is
just--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
to
be
clear,
we're
not
saying
there's
no
proximate
cause
requirement.
we're
saying
that
there
is
a
sufficient
assurance
that
the
function
of
proximate
cause,
of
limiting
defendant's
responsibility
to
the
matters
about
which
congress
is
concerned,
is
served
in
an
overdose
case
when
you
know
that
you
have
a
substance
that
is
controlled
in
large
part
because
of
precisely
this
risk,
that
then
it
causes
exactly
that
harm.
