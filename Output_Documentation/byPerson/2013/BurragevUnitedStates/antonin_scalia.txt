but
each
one
is
the
third
person.
i
mean,
each
one
of
them
is
the
third
person.
it
seems
to
me
each
one
is
a
but-for
cause.
and
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
say
there's
but-for
causation
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
--
as
i
understood
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
experts
testified
they
could
not
say
that
he
would
not
have
died
but
for
the
cocaine.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
different
from
this
case
where
what
is
put
to
you
is
he
--
you
could
say
he
would
not
have
died
but
for
the
drop
that
each
one
of
them
put
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
isn't
that
but-for
causation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
if
it's
a
form
of
but-for
causation.
it's
but-for
causation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
“
foreseeability
”
is
the
wrong
word.
i
don't
think,
you
know,
in
tort
law
we
--
we
use
the
word
“
foreseeability
”
for
palsgraf.
it's
a
matter
of
scope
of
the
risk.
it
may
not
be
foreseeable.
it
may
be
an
unusual
situation
that
will
cause
it,
but
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
risk.
and
when
you
sell
drugs,
you
know
that
one
of
the
things
that
can
happen
is
that
the
drugs
will
produce
an
overdose.
i'm
not
sure
--
i
wouldn't
call
it
foreseeability.
i
would
call
it
scope
of
the
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
substantial
factor?
i
mean,
i
don't
follow
you.
i
don't
see
how
it
gets
you
to
where
you
want
to
be
unless
“
substantial
factor
”
means
that
it
would
have
been
a
but-for
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
strange
terminology
for
it.
i
mean,
they
really
ought
to
get
another
terminology
if
that's
what
they
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
be
a
substantial
factor
without
being
independently
sufficient.
justice
antonin
scalia
marginally.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
for
--
for
any
crime,
there
are
two
things.
we
punish
the
intent,
the
wickedness,
and
in
both
cases,
the
party
is
equally
wicked,
but
we
also
punish
the
consequence.
in
one
case,
the
party
dies
because
of
that
person's
act.
and
in
the
other
case,
nobody
dies
just
because
of
that
person's
act.
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
run
away
from
that.
it's
--
it's
common
in
the
criminal
law
that
--
that
two
acts
that
are
equally
unlawful,
equally
nefarious,
one
happens
to
kill
somebody,
the
other
one
doesn't.
we
punish
one
person,
we
don't
punish
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
say,
my
goodness,
if
only
1
percent
overdose,
that
--
that
isn't
very
foreseeable.
i
--
you
know,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
submit
that
to
the
jury.
i
think
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
--
we
banned
these
drugs,
because
they
are
risky,
and
anybody
should
know
that
if
somebody
dies
from
it,
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
risk
when
you
sold
the
cocaine.
now,
i
guess
it's
different
if
you're
selling,
i
don't
know,
sleeping
pills,
okay?
which
are
part
of
a
cocktail
that
--
that
causes
somebody
to
die.
that's
the
situation
that
worries
me.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
cocaine
--
the
person
selling
the
cocaine
can
be
liable
for
the
cocktail
death,
i
guess
the
person
who
sold
the
sleeping
pills
could,
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
just
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether
it
was
foreseeable
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
cannot
say,
as
i
--
as
i
think
i
say,
that
if
you
sell
cocaine
and
if
it
is
without
a
doubt
the
but-for
cause
of
somebody's
death,
you're
liable
under
this
statute.
you
don't
think
that's
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
--
congress
supposedly
knew
that
and
--
and
could
have
written
a
statute
so
that
you're
--
you're
liable
if
you
are
a
contributing
cause
of
--
of
the
death.
it
didn't
do
so.
it
said
--
it
says
it
has
to
result
in
the
death.
and
--
and
i
take
that
to
mean
at
least,
at
least
but-for
causality.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
should
“
result
in
”
not
--
not
mean
but-for
causality?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
does
“
result
in
”
refer
--
refer
to
what
--
what
we
do
in
the
common
law?
i
mean,
i
apply
common
law
rules
when
--
when
congress
adopts
a
common
law
crime,
yes.
it
--
it
brings
along
the
--
the
soil
that
goes
with
that
crime,
right?
but
this
is
not
a
common
law
crime,
and
--
and
congress
used
the
english
language
“
results
in
”,
and
i
would
take
that
to
mean
causes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
substantial.
justice
antonin
scalia
opposing
counsel
says
substantial
means
that
it
would
independently
have
sufficed.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
what
you
mean
by
it,
we'll
all
cheer.
but
--
but
i
suspect
that's
not
what
you
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
was
found
in
this
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
what
you
call
a
substantial
factor?
that
all
contributed
to
the
outcome?
the
one
grain
of
heroin
would
--
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
then
--
then
you
don't
agree
with
that
--
that
stuff
that
you
just
read
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
substantial?
what
do
you
think
is
substantial?
10
percent,
20
percent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--5
percent,
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
the
language
--
their
position
now
is
not
that
it's
enough
that
it's
an
important
factor.
rather,
and
i
would
like
to
know
your
view
on
this,
your
opposing
counsel
contends
that
the
courts
and
commentators
who
use
the
“
substantial
factor
”
terminology
mean
by
“
a
substantial
factor
”
a
factor
that
would
by
itself
have
been
sufficient.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
of
that
imprecision,
some
poor
devils
will
have
to
go
to
jail
for
a
longer
period
than
otherwise,
you
know.
tough
luck.
