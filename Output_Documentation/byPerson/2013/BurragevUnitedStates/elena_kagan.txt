justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
thought
the
hypothetical
was
a
bit
different.
i
thought
it
only
takes
two
drops
to
kill
him.
and
that's
what
creates
the
problem
where
you
don't
have
but-for
causation
because
you
don't
know
whether
you
are
the
extraneous
drop
or
whether
you
were
the
drop
that
actually
killed
him.
justice
elena
kagan
so
when
you
use
that
language
of
“
substantial
factor
”,
what
you
really
mean
to
point
to
is
independent
sufficiency?
two
people
shoot,
either
one
would
have
killed
the
person,
but
you
can't
say--
justice
elena
kagan
--that
either
is
the
but-for
cause
because
of
the
fortuity
of
the
second
act?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
don't
mean
that
to
go
any
further
than
independent
sufficiency?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
here's
what
the
government
might
say
back
to
you.
they
might
say,
you
know,
in
these
drug
cases,
people
often
take
drugs
in
combination
and
then
they
overdose,
and
it's
really
impossible
for
anybody
to
be
able
to
say
what
you
are
requiring
an
expert
to
say.
in
other
words,
it's
impossible
to
say
it
was
the
heroin,
not
the
cocaine,
it
was
the
cocaine
and
not
the
heroin,
it
was
both,
it
was
neither.
it's
just
--
it's
all
we
can
talk
about
is
likelihoods.
you
know,
just
as
this
expert
did.
they
say
the
fact
that
he
took
the
heroin
made
it
much
more
likely
that
he
would
die.
and
that's
all
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
show
in
a
case
like
that,
this,
and
because
of
that,
we
--
that's
got
to
be
enough.
justice
elena
kagan
so
mr.--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
mr.
horwich,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
dispute
before
this
court
is
this:
you
have
somebody
who's
taken
five
drugs.
one
of
them
is
heroin.
and
the
--
the
experts
get
on
the
stand,
and
they
say:
did
the
heroin
cause
the
death?
and
the
experts
say:
really
can't
say
whether
the
heroin
caused
the
death
in
the
sense
that
if
the
--
if
he
hadn't
taken
the
heroin,
he
wouldn't
have
died.
so
they
say:
well,
what
can
you
say?
he
said:
well,
what
i
can
say
is
that
if
he
hadn't
--
is
that
the
heroin
made
it
more
likely
that
he
died.
well,
how
much
more
likely
did
the
heroin
make
it?
well,
the
heroin
made
it
50
percent
more
likely
that
death
resulted.
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
take
mine.
justice
elena
kagan
because
i
think
that
that's
actually--
justice
elena
kagan
--yes,
and
he
might
have
died
even
without
the
heroin,
because
all
the
other
substances
might
have
been
perfectly
adequate
to
cause
death.
so
i
really
can't
tell
you
that
the
heroin
played
--
even
--
you
know,
even
to
use
your
language,
i
can't
tell
you
whether
the
heroin
contributed.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
a
likelihood,
a
probability
that
the
heroin
led
to
death.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
again,
that
question
of
words,
the
experts
were
very
careful
to
say:
"i
cannot
tell
you
that
in
the
absence
of
the
heroin
he
wouldn't
have
died.
"
"he
might
have
died
even
without
the
heroin,
the
experts
said.
"
"the
only
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
heroin
made
it
more
likely
that
he
died.
"
justice
elena
kagan
it's
a
bad
sign
that
you're
using
the
hypotheticals
rather
than
the
facts
of
your
case,
you
know?
the
facts
of
your
case
are
that
the
expert
gets
on
the
stand
and
says:
i
can't
tell
you
that
the
heroin
was
responsible
for
the
death.
i
cannot
tell
you
that
in
the
absence
of
the
heroin
he
wouldn't
have
died.
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
heroin
was
--
what
i
can
do
is
to
give
you
essentially
a
probability
that
the
heroin
caused
the
death.
and
you're
saying
that's
enough,
even
if
the
probability
is
as
small
as
50
percent.
justice
elena
kagan
they
said
it
contributed
to
the
set
of
drugs,
but
they
didn't
say
that
it
contributed
to
the
death.
they
had
no
idea
whether
it
contributed
to
the
death.
all
that
they
were
able
to
say
is:
there
are
five
drugs;
here
are
some
probabilities;
here
are
some
likelihoods.
if
you
don't
like
the
probability
language:
here
is
the
likelihood.
using
heroin
made
it
more
likely
that
he
would
die,
but
we
can't
say
that
using
heroin
killed
him.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
much
more
likely
does
it
have
to
make
it
that
he
would
die?
50
percent?
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
30
percent?
justice
elena
kagan
so
is
that
the
question?
is
--
in
other
words,
is
the
heroin
more
likely
to
have
caused
the
death
than
the
cocaine,
than
the
marijuana,
than
the
sleeping
pills?
so
we
can't
really
say
that
the
heroin
caused
the
death,
but
it's
more
likely
to
have
caused
the
death
than
anything
else
he
took?
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
question?
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
but
maybe
not
to
the
death.
justice
elena
kagan
and
is
the
one
question
is
--
is
how
this
all
relates
to
the
“
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
”
instruction
in
criminal
cases?
i
mean,
the
idea
of
a
test
which
focuses
in
the
way
yours
does
on
probabilities
and
likelihoods,
and
then
we
go
tell
the
jury,
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
was
more
likely
to
have
caused
the
death
than
anything
else,
or
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
increased
the
likelihood
of
death
by
50
percent.
i
mean,
that
seems
a
very
odd
kind
of
question
for
a
jury
to
consider,
but
that's
exactly
what
you
would
be
asking
a
jury
to
consider.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
statute
--
the
statute
says
did
it
result
in
death.
it
did
not
--
the
statute
does
not
say
--
does
not
criminalize
a
drug
that
has
physiological
effects.
it
criminalizes
a
drug
when
it
results
in
death.
and
you
can't
say
anything
about
resulting
in
death
except
as
--
except
by
reference
to
probabilities
and
likelihoods.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
horwich,
i
just
don't
understand
what
“
substantial
factor
”
means
in
the
way
you
are
using
it.
i
understand
what
ms.
campbell
said,
because
she
said
“
substantial
factor
”
just
means
independently
sufficient.
but
you
are
saying
“
substantial
factor
”
can
mean
more
than
that,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
mean
a
but-for
cause.
how
is
something
that
is
a
substantial
factor
in
a
death
without
their
being
able
to
say
that
it
was
a
but-for
cause
of
the
death?
justice
elena
kagan
so
it's
not
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
the
death,
because
that
assumes
that
it
actually
played
a
role
in
causing
the
death
and
you
can't
say
whether
it
played
a
role
in
causing
the
death.
that's
what
creates
this
problem.
justice
elena
kagan
in
the
sense
of
if
it
hadn't
been
there,
the
death
would
not
have
occurred.
justice
elena
kagan
you
can't
say
that,
that's
the
point.
