justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
--
if
i'm
wrong.
i
might
be
missing
something.
the
tip
in
j.l.
was
not
a
--
did
not
assert
that
a
crime
was
being
committed,
so
there
was
something
suspicious.
there
was
no
crime
in
possession
of
the
gun.
or
correct
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
here
--
here,
there
was
--
the
report
was
a
crime.
or
is
that
not
a
correct
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
--
but
the
tip,
in
and
of
itself,
did
not
indicate
that
a
crime
was
being
committed,
which
is
different
from
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about
an
interpretation
of
what
the
tip
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
a
terry
stop.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
might
have
had
grounds
for
a
terry
stop.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
think
there's
a
difference,
but
i
think
for
our
purposes
we
can
assume
that
the
cases
are
comparable
in
that
respect--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
not
comparable,
perhaps,
in
others.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
get
an
a
for
consistency.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
about
common
sense.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
what
you
would
do
if
you
were
on
this
court
with
those
hypotheticals?
what
is
your
position
that
should
happen
in
those
two
hypotheticals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
as
to
what
the
court
should
do
in
those
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
it,
but
we're
interested
in
the
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
your
--
your
grade
for
consistency
depends
on
this
answer.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
grade
for
consistency
depends
on
this
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
my
recollection
of
hensley
is,
you're
right,
the
police
department
1
notifies
police
department
2.
but
a
premise
of
the
case,
i
had
thought,
was
that
police
department
1
had
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
explain
to
me
one
more
time
why
it's
relevant
that
there
were
these
details
that
it
was
a
particular
kind
of
crime,
that
it
was
silver,
the
license
plate.
that's
this
case.
suppose
in
another
case,
a
car
just
ran
me
off
the
road
and
it's
the
only
--
the
only
car
that's
on
highway
1
between
fort
bragg
and
the
state
park.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
incidentally
--
it
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
the
case
--
is
this
a
two
--
a
two-lane
road?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
thought.
