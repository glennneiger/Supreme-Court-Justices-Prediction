mr.
rachel
p
kovner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
brief
car
stops
based
on
anonymous
tips
of
reckless
or
drunken
driving
are
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
serve
a
critical
government
interest
in
removing
drunk
drivers
from
the
road--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--so--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--so,
your
honor,
i
think
i
agree
with
the
observation
that
there
are
some
behaviors
that
pose
an
ongoing
threat
to
others
on
the
roadway,
and
some
driving
violations
that
don't.
nhtsa,
the
national
highway
and
traffic
safety
administration
and
other
organizations
do
keep
track
of
what
kinds
of
behavior
are
associated
with
drunkenness.
and
the
court
in
this
case,
of
course,
looked
at
the
particular
behavior
and
said
is
this
really
a
reckless
driving
behavior,
the
kind
of
behavior
that
poses
this
imminent
danger?
so
there
is
a
line
that
courts
would
need
to
draw,
but
the
courts
that
are
engaging
in
this
kind
of
analysis
do
draw
that.
and
of
course--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--sure.
so
examples
of
behavior
on
the
other
might
be
a
seat
belt
violation,
and
they
also
might
be
behaviors
that
it's
a
real
judgment
call
whether
a
violation
occurred
or
not.
so
for
instance,
that
person
didn't
fully
stop
at
a
stop
sign.
we
might
have
doubts
about
whether
an
informant
who
we
don't
know
anything
about
can
accurately
perceive
that.
but
when
we're
talking
about
behavior
like--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--i
think
that
would
be
a
harder
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
correlated
with
intoxication
or
impairment.
as
you
say,
it's
very
common
but
i
think
the
behavior
that
we're
talking
about
here,
driving
somebody
else
off
the
road,
is
the
kind
of
behavior
that
shows
this
person
is--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--i
think
that's
close
to
the
line,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
always
illegal
and
it's
something
where
we
may
have
doubts
about
whether
the
informant
can
accurately
separate
this
person
was
breaking
the
law
from
this
person
wasn't.
i
think
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
behavior
that
poses--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--so--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
we
actually
think
and,
you
know,
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
here.
when
an
informant
gives
a
basis
for
knowledge,
you
have
reason
to
think
they
are
an
eyewitness.
but
the
court
has
also
recognized
that
there
are
certain
dangers
on
the
roadway
that
allow
intrusions
even
when
we
might
not
otherwise
allow
them.
so,
for
instance,
in
the
sitz
case
the
court
said
drunk
that
drunk
driving
is
such
a
great
danger
that
we're
going
to
allow
even
random
stops
of
vehicles
to
detect
drunk
drivers.
so
i
think
the
court
has
indicated
there
are
certain
driving
behaviors
that
are
so
dangerous
we'll
allow
even
suspicionless
stops.
and
here,
of
course,
we're
not
dealing
with
suspicionless
stops.
the
questions
from
the
court
have
indicated
some
of
the
reasons
why
that's
the
case.
here
we
have
a
caller
who
has
demonstrated
their
basis
for
knowledge
and
officers
have
been
able
to
confirm
that.
so
we're
talking
about
tips
where
the
person
relays
the
kind
of
details
you
can
really
only
have
if
you
are
an
eyewitness
to
this
person's
driving
on
the
road.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
so,
your
honor,
i
think
this
class
of
people
who
are
going
to
have
the
relevant
knowledge
is
almost
exclusively
eyewitnesses.
you
may
also
have
a
few
people
who
have
seen
the
person's
car
and
happen
to
know
what
direction
they're
headed
in,
but
for
the
most
part
we're
talking
about
a
very
narrow
class
of
individuals
that
are
largely
going
to
be
eyewitnesses
to
this
person's
driving
on
the
road.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
so
somebody
who's
malicious,
who's
a
prankster,
is
still
going
to
have
this
kind
of
specialized
knowledge,
and
that's
not
something
a
malicious
prankster
is
necessarily
going
to
have.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
your
honor,
i
think
the
critical
thing
that's
present
here
that
wasn't
present
in
j.l.
is
the
basis
for
knowledge.
so
as
the
passage
that
justice
breyer
read
signals,
we're
talking
there
about
concealed
criminal
activity,
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
there's
nothing
in
the
tip
that
signals
how
the
informant
knows
this
person
had
a
gun.
here,
in
contrast,
the
person
is
telling
you
"i'm
an
eyewitness.
"
"this
person
just
ran
me
off
the
road.
"
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
i
think
this
case
comes
out
differently
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
yes,
the
tip
would
be
stronger
than
the
tip
in
j.l.
if
the
person
related
eyewitness
basis.
but
the
second
has
to
do
with
the
imminent
danger
here
that's
posed
by
a
car
that's
moving
down
the
roadway
and
that's
being
operated
by
a
potentially
drunk
driver,
and
the
reduced
expectations
of
privacy
you
have
when
you're
talking
about
a
vehicle
stop.
and
those
were
front
and
center
in
sitz,
where
the
court
said
that
even
suspicionless
stops
can
be
justified
by
that
particular
danger.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
your
honor,
officers
could
follow
the
car,
and
if
they
do,
they
may
witness
a
subsequent
dangerous
behavior
that
could
justify
pulling
over
the
car.
the
problem
is
that
the
subsequent
dangerous
behavior
they
observe
may
be
the
car
swerving
into
another
lane
and
hitting
another
vehicle.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
remote
harm
at
all.
now,
this
is
a
harm
that
causes
one-third
of
all
traffic
accidents,
that
takes
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
a
year,
and
it's
a
harm
that
this
court
has
always
said
is
a
harm
of
the
first
order
that
justifies
the
kind
of
intrusions
that
we
might
not
otherwise
allow.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
your
honor,
i
agree
that
police
might
follow
a
car
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
would
dissipate.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
the
record
indicates
there
were
five
minutes
between
when
the
officers
first
saw
the
car
and
when
they
pulled
it
over.
they
weren't
five
minutes
of
uninterrupted
observation.
they
were
five
minutes
in
which
the
officers
were
turning
their
cars
around
because
they
were
headed
in
the
opposite
direction,
were
catching
up
to
a
car
along
the
freeway.
so
the
california
supreme
court
analyzed
that
delay
and
found
the
fact
that
they
didn't
observe
additional--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--the
only
thing
i
can
point
to
about
that,
your
honor,
is
the
way
that
the
california
supreme
court
treated
this,
which
is
that.
because
they
pointed
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
two-lane
highway
and
that
it's
particularly
dangerous
on
this
particular
road
to
engage
in
this
behavior.
but
i
don't
know
about,
you
know,
whether
there
are
pits
on
the
side
of
the
road.
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
your
honor--
mr.
rachel
p
kovner
--your
honor,
if
police
are
willing
to
lie
about
what
they
saw
or,
you
know,
in
the
cases
of
some
rogue
officers,
they
may
exist,
but
this
rule
isn't
going
to
prevent
--
no
rule
is
going
to
prevent
that.
officers
could
just
as
easily
lie
about
what
they
saw.
thank
you.
