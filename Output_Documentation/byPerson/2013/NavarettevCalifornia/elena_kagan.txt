justice

kagan
but
in
the
context
in
which
we've
approved
sobriety
checkpoints,
why
should
we
get
bent
out
of
shape
over
this?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
why
is
that
an
important
line?
why
should
we
be
more
concerned
when
an
individual
automobile
is
pulled
over?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
as
long
as
you
can
identify
the
car,
you
need
no
specificity
as
to
what
the
car
has
actually
done.
in
other
words,
you
know,
just
saying
the
driver
was
reckless
is
enough.
is
that
--
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
what
would
fail
your
test?
justice
elena
kagan
and,
mr.
laurence,
do
i
understand
what
you're
saying?
you're
saying
that
in
every
case
when
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
threshold
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
has
been
met
or
whether
the
level
of
probable
cause
has
been
met,
that
courts
can
take
into
account
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
and
what
would
not
count
as
probable
cause
for
one
crime
will
count
as
probable
cause
for
another?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
understand
how
what
you're
saying
is
different
from
what
i
just
said,
and
that
would
seem
to
me
to
work
quite
a
substantial
change
in
--
in
fourth
amendment
law.
that
when
we
decide
whether
reasonable
suspicion
exists,
when
--
whether
probable
cause
exists,
that
we
get
to
take
into
account
how
serious
the
offense
is.
justice
elena
kagan
the
balancing
occurs
categorically.
we
decide
that
there's
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard
by
balancing
interests.
what
we
don't
do
is
say,
you
know,
depending
on
how
serious
we
think
this
crime
is,
more
or
less
will
meet
that
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
that
would
be
a
very
substantial
reworking
of
fourth
amendment
law
or
so
it
seems
to
me.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
elena
kagan
so
do
you
think,
mr.
laurence,
if
the
police
had
followed
this
man
for
half
an
hour
and
seen
no
other
signs
of
erratic
driving
and
nobody
can
drunk
drive
--
can
drive
drunk
for
half
an
hour
without
swerving,
without
doing
something
else.
so
they
could
still
have
stopped
the
car?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
thought
you
were
saying
as
long
as
somebody
had
--
had
given
an
account
that
sometime
ago
he
had
driven
another
driver
off
--
he
had
run
another
driver
off
the
road,
doesn't
matter
whether
you're
drunk,
doesn't
matter
anything,
there
was
an
account
of
an
illegal
act
taking
place,
and
that
was
enough
to
stop
him.
doesn't
matter
what
he's
doing
now.
justice
elena
kagan
but
all
crime
represents
a
threat
to
public
safety,
and
yet
we
have
these
standards.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
--
what
goes
on
the
other
side
of
the
line?
i
mean,
why
--
why
is
this
on
one
side
and
then
tell
me
what's
on
the
other.
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
somebody
cutting
someone
off
in
their
lane?
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
you
think
j.l.
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
tipster
had
said
"i
just
saw
these
guys
and
i
saw,
you
know,
one
of
them
had
a
gun?
"
