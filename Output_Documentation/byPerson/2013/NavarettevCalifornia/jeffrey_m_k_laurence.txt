mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
police
officer
may
act
on
an
anonymous
tip
that
reports
reckless
or
drunk
driving
by
immediately
stopping
the
vehicle,
without
waiting
to
personally
observe
dangerous
driving
that
could
threaten
others.
an
officer
can
reasonably
rely
on
such
a
tip
because
the
importance
of
the
governmental
interest
in
protecting
the
public
from
the
ongoing
and
immediate
threat
of
drunk
driving
outweighs
the
minimal
intrusion
of
a
traffic
stop.
now,
petitioners
argue
that--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
not
every
reckless
driving
is
drunk
driving.
but
a
report
of
reckless
driving
gives
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
may
be
drunk,
and
that's
sufficient
for
the
stop
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
i
would
say
that
the
term
“
reckless
”
is.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
driving
is
something
that's
intimately
familiar
to
the
average
citizen.
and
when
a
citizen
is
going
to
call
in
and
make
a
report,
when
they
use
the
language
“
reckless
”,
that
has
meaning.
that
describes
a
behavior
that
poses
an
ongoing
threat
to
the
public.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
wouldn't
say
they're
synonymous,
but
i
would
say
that
one
is
the
indicator
of
the
other,
because
while
you
can--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--i
would
say
a
report
of
speeding
is
not
sufficient
to
have
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
i
would
say
that,
once
again,
the
public
has
lots
of
familiarity
with
driving,
and
they
can
recognize
the
difference
between
poor
driving
and
reckless
driving,
or
something,
or
drunk
driving.
and
when
people
are
going
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
make
that
call
to
911,
they're
doing
so
because
they
perceive
a
danger
on
the
roadway.
and
i
think
while
the
statistics
are
sparse
on
this,
the
footnote
2
in
the
government's
brief
is
particularly
helpful
in
this
regard
in
that
they
note
that
for
calls
that
are
made
to
911
centers
for
--
that
are
tracked
by
the
states,
between
25
and
50
percent
of
those
calls
result
in
arrests.
and
what
that
shows
is
that
the
public
knows
what
they
see
when
they
make
these
calls.
this
is
a
far--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--yes,
but
we
are
talking
about
reasonable
suspicion.
so
it
doesn't
require
certainty
or
probability.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
always
a
possibility
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
context.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
no,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
sufficient
to
pull
him
over
because
you
don't
have
any
governmental
--
you
don't
have
a
threat
to
public
safety
in
that
context.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
certainly,
there
are
laws,
and
the
officer,
i
guess,
would
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
is
a
traffic
violation,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
would
rise
to
the
level
of
implicating
public
safety
in
this
context.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
yes.
and
provided,
of
course,
that
you
have
the
additional
details
of
the
description
of
the
car,
the
location,
that
you
can--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--the
importance
of
those
details
is
that
they
allow
the
officers
to
confirm
that
this
is
a
personal
observation,
which
is
an
important
fact
that's
noted
in
gates,
that
when
you
have
a
report
of
personal
observation
of
illegal
conduct,
we
can
take
that
report
more
seriously.
it's
entitled
to
more
credibility
than
just
a
bare--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--yes,
that
is
true.
but
if
the
personal
knowledge
--
if
the
officer
can
use
that
personal
knowledge
to
confirm,
okay,
he
was
correct
about
the
report
of
the
car,
report
of
the
location,
report
of
the
direction
where
it's
supposed
to
be
going,
then
you
have
some
indication
that
the
personal
knowledge
is
accurate.
as
opposed
to
a
bare
tip
when
you're
talking
about
hidden
conduct,
then
you
have
to
look
to
predicted
details.
and
that
takes
us
into
the
j.l.
context
or
the--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well,
i
would
say
that
recklessness
carries
information
that
is
--
has
some
specificity.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
if
a
caller
calls
in
and
says,
i
saw
him
in
a
bar.
he
had
one
drink.
he
came
out
and
got
on
the
road
and
ran
away.
one
drink
is
not
going
to
rise
to
the
level--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well,
if
a
caller
says--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--where
the
courts
have
upheld
based
on
just
a
bare
tip?
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
the
closest
case
i
can
think
of
is
hensley
where
an
officer
was
relying
on
an
arrest
bulletin
from
another
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
case,
united
states
v.
hensley,
in
that
case
the
court
did
consider,
for
purposes
of
whether
a
prior
crime
had
been
committed,
whether
the
officer
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
that
individual,
it
took
into
account
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
there's
a--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well,
there
were
two
parts
to
the
--
to
the
case.
the
second
--
the
first
part
was
whether
you
could
make
a
detention
based
on
a
prior
crime
as
opposed
to
current
--
an
immediate
occurring
crime.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
and
so
it
looked
to
the
nature
of
the
crime,
and
whether
there
was
threat
to
public
safety
is
a
validation
consideration
in
authorizing
a
stop
for
a
prior
offense.
the
second
part
of
that
was
the
--
allowing
the
officer
to
rely
on
another
jurisdiction
is
reasonable--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--no,
it
was
from
another
police
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
no,
it
was
not
an
anonymous
tip.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
yes,
it
was.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
you
could
arrest
for
prior
--
for
a
prior
offense
if
it
was
a
felony.
it
reserved
the
question
of
whether
you
could
do
so
for
a
misdemeanor.
so
it's
already
looking
at
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
threat
to
public
safety.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
terms
of
when
we
can
deem
a
tip
reliable,
white
identified
two
components
to
the
inquiry.
one
is
the
indicia
of
reliability
and
the
other
was
the
content
of
the
tip.
and
so
we
have
to
take
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
and
the
threat
to
public
safety
into
account
in
determining
when
the
officer
can
rely
on
that
information.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
think
since
the
inception
of
the
doctrine,
this
court
identified
in
terry
that
reasonable
suspicion
results
from
a
balancing
of
the
governmental
interest.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
believe
that
was
something
that
was
indicated
in
hensley,
that
this
court
looked
to
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
officer
had
reasonable
suspicion
at
the
inception
in
making
that
stop
for
a
crime
that
had
occurred
two
weeks
earlier.
and
it
didn't
--
it
declined
to
consider
whether
or
not
that
would
be
sufficient
for
a
misdemeanor.
but
in
taking
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
into
account
in
determining
whether
or
not
they
could
make
that
stop,
that's
a
recognition
that
balancing
does
play
some
role.
and
in
white,
this
court
recognized
that
the
reliability
component
is
variable.
there's
a
difference
between
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion.
and
in
j.l.,
this
court
left
open
the
question
of
at
what
point
do
we
need
no
reliability
because
of
the
seriousness
of
the
governmental--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well,
i
think
it
helps
twofold.
there's
particularity,
so
you
know
who
you're
stopping.
and
it
goes
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
helping
confirm
that
the
person
actually
observed
what
they're
saying.
so
that
you
have
--
it
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
personal
observation.
so
it
builds
--
it
adds
an
additional
layer
of
--
of
the
indices
reliability
so
the
officer
can
rely
on
it
sooner.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
two-lane
coastal
highway,
which
obviously,
when
someone
runs
somebody
off
the
road,
poses
a
grave
threat
to
public
safety
in
that
context.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
think
there's
a
significant
difference
between
having
a
gun
in
your
pocket
and
actually
brandishing
it
or
firing
it.
i
think
if
the
j.l.
case
involved
somebody
threatening
other
people
with
a
gun
or
firing
the
gun,
it
would
have
involved
a
different
calculus.
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--that
is
--
that
is
correct.
but
once
you're
driving
drunk
down
the
road,
it's
--
you
have
--
the
threat
is
now
posed
to
everybody
on
the
highway
because
of
the
potential
for
that
person
to
lose
control
because--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
would
say
that
in
this
case,
it
is
enough.
but
i
would
say
it's
more
than
just
driving
irresponsibly.
running
somebody
off
the
road
reflects
that
they're
incapable
of
driving
their
car
in
a
way
that's
--
without
posing
a
safety
threat
to
other
people.
and
when
you're
dealing
with
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--okay.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
very
irresponsibly.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
i
think
there
may
be
a
point
where
the
threat
to
public
safety
would
suggest
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
is
dissipated
in
that
context.
and
so
after
--
after
50
miles--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well,
i
believe
that
the
threat
to
public
safety
plays
a
role
in
the
balance.
and
so
if
that's
dissipated,
then
at
that
point
you
have
--
the
--
the
reliability
of
the
tip
that
you're
relying
on
is
not
as
significant.
put
it
this
way.
when
you
have
the
threat
to
public
safety
balanced
in
the
totality
for
purposes
of
reliability,
if
that
dissipates,
then
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
tip
itself,
whether
it
is
internally
reliable
or
whether
it
has
enough
to
satisfy
j.l.--
i
think
that
when
you
have
an
immediate
threat,
and
you
have
a
report
of
drunk
driving,
the
officer
shouldn't
have
to
wait
to
see
that
50
miles
to
see
if
they
can
pass
or
fail.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
i'm
sorry.
yes.
a
report
that
someone
ran
him
off
the
road.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
it
is.
because
this
is
how
drunk
drivers
display
their
actions.
and
when
you're
dealing
with
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--that
would
present
a
different
set
of
circumstances.
if
you
have
an
instant
--
a
recognizable
instant
of
bad
driving
as
opposed
to
something
that
reflects
recklessness
or
drunkenness,
then
you
analyze
the
tip
differently.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--i
agree.
and
that's
because
what
we
do,
we
look
to
the
nature
of
their
driving,
draw
reasonable
inferences
from
that.
and
that's
all
officers
can
ever
do.
when
they
observe
something,
they
draw
reasonable
inferences
and
determine
whether
it
gives
them
suspicion.
one
thing
i
would
point
out,
that
the
chp
dispatchers,
the
testimony
in
this
case
reflects
that
they
asked.
they
asked
the
driver,
well,
what
did
you
see?
so
that
they
can
get
that
information
and
pass
it
along
to
give
the
officers
as
much--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--well,
again,
i
would
say
it's
not
about
demonstrating.
it's
not
about
certainty
or
probabilities.
it's
suspicion.
and
that
behavior
allows
the
officer
to
suspect
drunk
driving.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
wouldn't
draw
that
distinction.
i
think
reckless
driving,
in
and
of
itself,
can
pose
a
threat
to
public
safety
that
also
mandates
an
immediate
stop.
if
someone's
playing
chicken
with
another
car
on
the
road,
if
someone
is,
you
know,
testing
out
their
new
ferrari,
is
going
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
weaving
in
and
out
of
lanes,
those
all
represent
threats
to
public
safety.
all
those
circumstances--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--yes,
we
do
have
standards.
but
that
--
the
threat
to
public
safety
is
part
of
the
totality
of
circumstances.
it's
not
something
you
invoke
that
wipes
away
all
other
inquiries.
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
a
tip
that,
if
it
was
given
by
a
known
person,
i
think
would
undoubtedly
allow
the
officer
to
pull
that
car
over
immediately.
the
question
is
because
it
was
anonymous.
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
well,
i
believe
that
when
you're
looking
at,
at
what
point
it's
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
rely
on
the
content
of
that
tip
or
to
rely
on
--
on
that
tip
coming
in
and
act
on
it,
that
when
somebody
gives
their
name,
that
adds
a
layer
of
reliability
to
it,
even
without
verification.
and
i
think
one
thing
that
gates
says
in
the
context
of
somebody
who
reports
a
--
a
personal
observation
of
a
crime
is
that
even
if
we
doubt
their
veracity,
even
if
we
have
some
question
as
to
their
motives,
the
fact
that
they
are
giving
a
personal
observation,
they
note
that
it's
a
personal
observation,
and
giving
a
detailed
account
of
what
occurs,
that
report
is
entitled
to
a
greater
degree
of
reliability
than--
mr.
jeffrey
m
k
laurence
--not
the
same
threat
as
in
this
case,
your
honor.
