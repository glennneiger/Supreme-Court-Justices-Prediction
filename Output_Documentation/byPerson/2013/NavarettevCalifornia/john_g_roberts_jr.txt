chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
in
case
12-9490,
navarette
v.
california.
mr.
kleven.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
tip
--
if
the
tip
is,
is
this
car
is
driving
by
and
throwing
bombs
out
the
window,
okay,
every,
you
know,
whatever,
500
yards,
the
police
find
the
car,
they
have
to
wait
until
they
see
the
person
actually
throw
a
bomb
out
the
window
themselves
before
pulling
them
over?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
is
yes,
the
car
is
going
there
and
he's
throwing
a
bomb
out
and
it
goes
off,
but
he
has
to
wait
till
he
sees
them
throw
out
another
bomb?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
you
have
caller
id.
i
mean,
you
have
one
of
these
anonymous
flip
phones,
right?
you
can
buy
them,
it's
prepaid.
you
call
up
and
say,
i'm,
you
know,
john
smith,
i've
seen
this
and
they
look,
there's
the
caller,
there's
the
number.
then
they
can
do
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
all
caller
id
gives
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
any
indication
that
this
is
a
serious
problem?
the
false
tips?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
is
that
true?
i
mean,
how
many
people
die
from
drunk
driving
versus
how
many
people
die
from
firearms?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
we
have
held
that
the
--
the
standards
are
loosened
in
the
vehicle
context
because
your
expectation
of
privacy
is
diminished
when
you're
out
on
the
road
driving
along
in
--
in
a
vehicle.
does
that
have
any
pertinence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there's
no
way
for
the
officer
to
corroborate
the
allegation?
you
know,
you
see
--
see
somebody
on
the
street
grab
a
young
child,
throw
her
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
and
then
take
off.
and
somebody
calls
with
an
anonymous
tip
saying
this
fellow,
you
know,
in
this
car
has
got
a
child
in
the
trunk.
the
police
can
follow
the
person,
you
know,
for
hours
and
they're
not
going
to
see
any
corroborating
evidence.
can
they
pull
that
car
over?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
--
your
answer
in
that
case
is
that
the
police
cannot
pull
that
car
over?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
expand
it
a
little
bit.
it's
a
--
it's
a
one-lane
--
two-lane
road
going
down,
but
it
merges
into,
you
know,
an
eight-lane
expressway.
you
have
one
police
car.
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
that
police
car
to
maintain
surveillance.
and
you
say
they've
just
got
to
let
them
go.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
in
terms
of
your
position,
do
you
think
they
could
pull
the
car
over?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
--
the
atomic
bomb,
the
level
of
danger
is
great
enough,
but
the
young
girl
in
the
trunk,
the
level
of
danger
is
not
great
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
--
what
if
the
person
said
okay,
my
name
is
this,
you
know,
my
phone
number
is
this;
this
guy
drove
me
off
the
road.
they
can't
corroborate
that
until
they
stop
the
guy.
or
you're
saying
they
have
to?
they
have
to
wait,
they
have
to
make
the
call,
see
if
the
guy
is
there.
are
you
the
guy
that
just
called.
so
that
guy's
got
to
talk
on
his
cell
phone
while
he's
driving.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
laurence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
if
the
call
is,
you
know,
i'm
driving.
this
guy
just
drove
by
me.
i
looked
over.
he
didn't
have
his
seat
belt
on.
i
mean,
can
the
police
pull
that
guy
over?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
are
laws
against
driving
without
a
seat
belt
because
that
protects
people's
lives.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i've
never
understood.
what
good
do
those
--
you
know,
let's
say
that
i'm
at
a
party,
i
don't
like
somebody
there.
i
see
they
have
a
couple
of
drinks.
i
know
what
kind
of
car
he
drives.
i
know
the
--
i
can
look
at
the
license
plate.
i
call,
you
know,
ten
minutes
later.
i
know
where
he
goes
driving
home.
there's
this
car.
it's
a
white
whatever.
it's
got
this
license
plate.
it's
swerving
all
over
the
road.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whether
he
is
or
not,
the
police
go
up,
they
pull
him
over
and
find
out,
yes,
yes.
you
know,
he
fails
the
breathalyzer
and
i
get
my
revenge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
say
my
point
is
it
need
not
necessarily
be
a
personal
observation
of
the
person
operating
the
car.
it
may
be
prior
knowledge.
and
i
gather
one
of
the
issues
we're
concerned
about
is
people
using
this
to,
you
know,
exact
revenge
or
--
or
do
something
else
having
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
person
is
violating
the
law
on
the
highway.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we're
going
to
hear
from
ms.
kovner
first.
ms.
kovner?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
where
does
that
--
i
think
this
is
the
question
justice
kagan
asked
earlier
--
how
does
the
nature
of
the
offense
affect
the
reasonableness
of
the
suspicion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
in
either
case,
you
have
let's
say
the
seat
belt
and
the
swerving
driver.
it's
the
same
witness.
he
said
still
it's
a
white
ford.
the
reasonableness
of
the
suspicion
would
seem
to
me
to
be
totally
divorced
from
what
it's
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
just
not
true.
it's
--
it's
an
acquaintance.
i
know
what
kind
of
car
he
drives,
i
know
where
he's
going.
i
didn't
see
anything
on
the
road,
but
i
call
the
police
and
say,
oh,
there's
this,
you
know,
white
ford
swerving
all
over
the
road.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
concern
that
you
want
to
have
the
police
pull
over
people
that
you
don't
like,
where
you
know
somebody's
got
something
bad
in
the
car
and
you
don't
like
it,
and
so
you're
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
police
don't
have
to
observe
anything
and
yet
you
can
still
get
them
to
pull
over
this
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
danger
from
the
police
side?
in
other
words,
they
know
or
they
suspect
that
the
guy
driving
the
white
car
has
a
lot
of
marijuana
in
the
trunk.
they
have
no
basis
for
pulling
him
over.
and
they
say,
well,
guess
what,
we
got
an
anonymous
tip
that
he
was
driving
erratically,
so
we
pulled
him
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
protection
is
there
against
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kleven,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
another
one,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
somebody
has
five
drinks
and
goes
and
gets
in
the
car,
that's
not
intentionally
trying
to
harm
someone?
or
recklessly
trying
to
harm--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
