throwing
bombs
doesn't
count,
but
carrying
a
bomb
does,
is
that
it?
were
they
throwing
bombs
that
they
weren't
carrying?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
was
illegal.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
illegal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
he
gets
an
a
for
consistency.
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
said
you
acknowledged
or
didn't
repudiate
the
statement
in
--
in
our
opinion
in
j.l.
that
if
there
was
a
bomb
in
the
car,
that
would
be
something
else.
what
--
what
if
there's
in
the
car
--
the
tip
is
this
person
has
an
atomic
bomb
given
him
by
al
qaeda;
he
is
driving
it
into
the
center
of
los
angeles
to
--
to
eradicate
the
entire
city,
okay.
let
it
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
tells
you
the
license
number,
where
the
car
is.
you
can't
stop
the
car?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
see,
he's
not
consistent.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you're
willing
to
accept
our
allowing
--
or
allowing
the
police
to
stop
the
car
with
the
atom
bomb
and
even
allowing
the
police
to
stop
the
car
with
the
kidnapped
girl
in
the
trunk.
once
--
you
know,
once
you
give
away
those,
we're
just
arguing
about
details,
where
you
draw
the
line.
does
--
does
drunken
driving
fall
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
line,
and
some
of
us
may
think
drunken
driving
is
--
is
pretty
serious
and
probably,
you
know,
as
serious
as
having
a
kidnapped
girl
in
the
trunk.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
more
than
that,
i
want
you
to
say
the
court
shouldn't.
let
the
car
go.
bye-bye,
los
angeles.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
you
would
--
you
would
also
say,
to
tie
it
into
justice
breyer's
question,
you
would
also
say
that
that
tip,
"somebody
ran
me
off
the
road.
"
would
not
justify
the
court
--
the
police
in
stopping
the
car
just
to
make
sure
that
this
car
was
not
the
one
that
drove
the
guy
off
the
road,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
drunkenness.
the
tip
doesn't
say
anything
about
drunkenness.
it
just
said
this
car
drove
me
off
the
road.
you'd
say
the
police
could
not
follow
that
car,
pull
him
over,
and
--
and
ask
did
you
--
did
you
drive
somebody
off
the
road?
justice
antonin
scalia
following
the
car
is
going
to
do
them
no
good
as
to
whether
he
drove
--
drove
somebody
off
the
road.
they're
not
looking
for
a
drunk.
they're
looking
for
somebody
who
drove
somebody
off
the
road,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
if
the
guy
admitted
it,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
play
mutt
and
jeff
with
him
and
he
--
oh,
yeah,
i
did,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
necessarily
drunkenness.
i
think
there
--
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
get
tickets
for
reckless
driving
who
have
not
served
jail
terms
for
driving
drunk.
the
two
are
far
from
synonymous.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
between
the,
what,
50
and
75
percent
they've
stopped
people
without
just
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
they've
--
they've
troubled
people
who
shouldn't
have
been
troubled.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
reckless
driving
always
does,
whether
it
--
whether
it's
the
consequence
of
inebriation
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
simple
call
saying,
boy,
this
guy,
you
know,
he
cut
in,
in
front
of
me.
he's
changing
lanes
too
frequently--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
--
that
enables
the
policeman,
without
observing
any
of
that
reckless
driving,
to
stop
the
car
further
down
the
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
this
call
didn't
say
i
think
the
guy
was
drunk.
it
just
said
somebody
drove
--
you
know,
drove
me
off
the
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
so
this
isn't
--
it
isn't
a
call
that
says
there's
a
drunken
driver.
it's
just
a
call
that
says
somebody
drove
irresponsibly,
right?
and
that's
enough
to
stop
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
really
irresponsibly,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
really
irresponsibly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
a
report
of
drunk
driving.
justice
antonin
scalia
somebody
ran
me
off
the
road.
somebody
was
driving
really
irresponsibly.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
enough
to
stop
him
down
the
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
cutting
me
off
too
quickly,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
cuts
right
in
front
of
me.
really
ticks
me
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
an
entirely
different
case
if
the
tip
--
if
the
tip
here
was,
you
know,
i
was
at
a
party.
this
guy
got
in
his
car.
he
should
not
have
turned
the
key
on
in
that
car.
this
guy
is
really
drunk.
you
should
stop
that
car
on
the
road.
i
think
that's
totally
different
from
somebody
just
saying
this
guy
swerved
or
this
guy
drove
me
off
the
road.
you're
--
you're
just
making
the
assumption
that
--
that
every
--
every
one
of
those
incidents
demonstrates
a
drunk
behind
the
wheel,
and
i
just
don't
think
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
a
teenager
standing
on
a
street
corner
with
a
couple
of
other
teenagers
with
a
gun
in
his
belt
represents
a
threat
to
public
safety?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
that
--
but
that
second
danger
--
you
may
have
a
drunken
driver
on
the
road;
that
danger
can
be
eliminated
by
following
the
car.
you
don't
have
to
stop
the
car
right
away.
you
can
follow
it
and
if
indeed
the
driver
seems
to
be
driving
erratically,
then
you
can
stop.
you'd
have
probable
cause.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
automatically
allow
a
stop
in
order
to
prevent
all
of
the
horribles
that
are
going
to
arise
from
drunk
driving.
follow
the
car.
if
he's
behaving
like
a
drunk
driver
then
stop
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
so
remote.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
broad
rule
that
is
contrary
to
what
we
normally
do
for
searches
and
seizures
because
now
and
then,
it
would
seem
to
me
very
rarely,
before
the
police
can
stop
the
drunk
driver
he
kills
somebody.
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
could
happen
now
and
then
but
it's
pretty
fanciful.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
drawing
the
line
at
intentional
conduct?
the
guy
who
has
a
bomb
is
going
to
use
it.
he's
intentionally
going
to
use
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
intentionally
doing
action
that
is
going
to
harm
more
than
one
person,
as
opposed
to,
hmm,
maybe
this
person
might
accidentally,
because
he's
inebriated,
hurt
somebody?
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
clear
line
between
somebody
who's
--
who's
bent
on
an
intentional
crime
and
somebody
who
might
harm
somebody
because
of
his
conduct.
you
like
that
one?
