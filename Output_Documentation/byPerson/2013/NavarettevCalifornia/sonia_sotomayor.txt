justice
sonia
sotomayor
white
suggested
that
we
don't
have
an
absolute
rule
with
respect
to
requiring
independent
corroboration
of
the
actual
illegal
conduct.
in
white,
the
--
the
tipster
gave
future
predictive
information,
but
all
of
it
was
innocent,
somebody
driving
a
car
and
going
to
a
particular
place.
now
you're
asking
us
to
import
that
wholesale.
why
don't
we
just
stick
to
our
general
standard,
which
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
look
at
what
failure
there
is
in
the
logic
of
the
california
court
below.
it
--
it
looked
at
the
quality
of
the
information
regarding
the
vehicle,
which
is
--
a
legitimate
tipster
will
tell
you
what
the
vehicle
looks
like
and
its
license
plate
or
enough
information
so
it
can
be
identified.
it
looked
at
the
caller
actually
witnessing
the
event
and
giving
you
enough
detail
to
know
that
it's
not
a
legal
conclusion,
but
an
actual
event
that
suggests
recklessness.
and
corroboration
of
the
--
of
the
details
given
by
the
tipster.
isn't
that
the
application
of
our
traditional
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
just
not
true
in
florida
v.
j.l.
because
the
individual
didn't
match
the
description
completely
and
there
were
two
or
three
individuals
there,
not
just
one.
and
so
--
and
there
was
no
predictive
or
no
other
detail
other
than
someone
in
this
general
area.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
reason
to
believe
the
caller
had
personal
knowledge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
reason
to
believe
the
person
had
personal
knowledge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
didn't
say
that
the
gun
was
pulled
on
him
or
that
--
or
how
he
saw
it
or
how
he
knew.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
don't
think
there's
something
significant
about
calling
up
and
saying
someone
forced
me
off
the
road?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
every
reckless
driving
drunk
driving?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
every
reckless
driving
drunk
driving?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
if
somebody
just
calls
and
says,
x
vehicle
is
driving
recklessly,
says
no
more,
doesn't
describe
how,
doesn't
give
you
any
details
as
to
how
they
know
it.
is
that
enough
for
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
how
about
speeding?
there's
plenty
of
people
who
speed
regularly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
reckless
behavior?
so
how
do
you
know
someone
who
calls
--
my
mother,
who
can't
drive
above
50,
thinks
that
when
i
go
51
that
i'm
speeding
and
reckless.
i'm
speeding
and
reckless.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
hensley's
victim
wasn't
a
victim;
meaning
there
was
--
it
was
an
anonymous
tip?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
so
it
wasn't
an
anonymous
tip?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
wasn't
public
safety.
it
was
the
report
of
a
crime
by
a
known
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
please
define
for
me
what
behavior
would
give
police
officers
or
what
descriptors
would
be
adequate
for
the
police
to
think
someone's
drunk.
swerving,
i
know,
has
been
mentioned.
but
reckless
driving,
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
that
there
could
be
a
wide
variety
of
reckless
driving.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
other
things
would
a
--
would
a
caller
have
to
say?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
what
you're
saying
to
me,
am
i
correct,
that
almost
any
moving
violation
counts?
changing
a
lane
without
a
signal,
which
seems
to
be
endemic
in
washington,
but--
