i
thought
that
j.l.
gave
an
example
of
an
exception
that
the
report
is
somebody
is
carrying
a
bomb?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
tip
that
someone
is
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
and
we
have
held
that
that
has
to
be
corroborated
--
corroborated.
you
can
take
out
a
concealed
weapon
in
an
instant
and
fire
it
and
kill
lots
of
people.
in
fact,
it
was
pointed
out
that
there
are
more
deaths
caused
by
guns
than
there
are
from
drunk
driving.
so
what's
the
difference?
the
--
the
argument
on
the
drunk
driving
is
very,
very
dangerous,
but
so
is
having
a
gun
in
one's
pocket.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
--
once
--
once
you
brandish
it,
it's
too
late.
the
damage
will
be
caused.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
why
--
the
--
we
have
the
case
of
the
trusted
informer.
the
informer
several
times
has
given
the
police
tips
and
it
turned
out
to
be
right.
and
then
we
have
another
side,
the
anonymous
person.
then
there's
somebody
who
calls,
gives
a
correct
name
and
address,
but
no
record
at
all
of
reliability.
why
should
the
fact
that
the
name
is
known
--
the
name
of
the
informer
is
known
if
the
police
have
no
reason
to
believe
one
way
or
another
that
this
informer
is
reliable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that
different
from
the
knowledge
in
j.l.
that
they
were
three
young
men,
they
were
described,
and
the
caller
says
"the
one
with
the
gun
is
the
one
with
the
plaid
shirt.
"
all
of
that
was
corroborated
by
the
police,
and
yet
we
held
that
that
was
no
indication
that
a
crime
had
been
committed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
we
have
the
police
did
follow
the
vehicle
for
about
5
miles
and
saw
nothing
erratic
about
the
driving.
so
perhaps
if
the
police
had
immediately
stopped
the
person
or
--
but
don't
we
have
to
take
account
that
there
was
no
corroboration?
the
police
get
there.
even
if
they
could
stop
him
instantly
when
they
have
no
corroboration,
then
that
doesn't
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion.
