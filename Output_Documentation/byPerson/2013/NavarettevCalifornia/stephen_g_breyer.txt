justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
this?
in
j.l.,
the
court
made
quite
a
point
of
saying:
"an
accurate
description
of
a
subject's
readily
observable
location
is
reliable
in
a
limited
--
limited
sense,
namely,
identifying
the
person.
"
"such
a
tip,
however,
does
not
show
that
the
tipster
has
knowledge
of
concealed
criminal
activity.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
not
concealed
here.
so
that's
an
obvious
difference.
i
mean,
one
case
it
was
concealed;
this
case
it
isn't
concealed.
what
do
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
--
didn't
the
tip
here
have
something
to
do
with
his
driving
around
in
a
wild
way
or
at
least
an
unusual
way?
i'm
not
sure
i
would
have
followed
him
if
it
had
been
me.
anyway,
you
see
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
--
that's
why
i
asked
you,
and
i
pressed
the
point
a
little
bit,
because
in
the
beginning
of
your
brief,
it
says
that
the
anonymous
tip,
what
you
say,
indicated
that
a
ford
f-150
pickup
truck
had
run
someone
off
the
road.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
maybe
you
do
have
to
know
specially
whether
the
person's
drunk
or
not,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
some
special
knowledge
of
anything
concealed
to
know
if
somebody
has
run
somebody
off
the
road.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
the
person
weren't
drunk,
i
think
it's
illegal
to
run
someone
else
off
the
road.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
but
you're
just
saying
--
i
mean,
but
his
basic
point
is,
on
the
other
side,
is
these
are
all
variations
of
the
famous
white
horse
defense.
you
don't
know
the
--
the
white
horse
defense?
your
honor,
my
client
was
innocent
because
at
the
time
of
the
crime
he
was
in
yugoslavia
wearing
a
white
horse
--
riding
a
white
horse.
and
to
prove
it,
i
have
the
horse
here
in
court.
you
see?
i
mean,
you
can't
--
it's
bootstrapping
to
put
it
more
succinctly.
all
you
know
is
that
somebody
came
in
and
quoted
--
and
said
there
was
a
crime.
and
that's
all
you
know.
and
now
--
now
when
--
when
are
instances
where
no
more
than
the
report
that
it's
a
crime,
that's
reasonable
suspicion.
that's
--
give
me
some
other
instances
where
the
courts
have
upheld
well,
that's
enough.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
common
sense.
i'm
saying
what
the
courts
have
held.
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
bare
tip.
a
description
that
a
crime
is
occurring
where
has
--
that's
all.
i
mean,
and
--
and
then
we
have
a
question
of
well,
is
it
in
the
one
category
or
the
other?
because
what
we
have
here,
someone
phones
in
and
says
a
crime
is
occurring.
and
--
and
we
know,
we've
corroborated
the
following.
if
a
crime
is
occurring,
he
was
in
a
position
to
know
because
he
can
define
--
he
can
talk
about
the
white
horse
or
he
can
talk
about
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
we
have
to
get
into
the
drunk
driving.
it's
3
miles
south
of
the
humboldt
county
border
on
--
do
you
know
the
answer
to
this?
is
it
in
the
record?
i
mean,
on
many
sections
of
that
road
in
mendocino
county
you
drive
someone
off
the
road,
they
are
dead.
i
mean,
there
are
sheer
drops,
and
so
i
just
wonder,
if
i
look
that
up
here,
what's
the
situation
where
this
supposedly
took
place?
