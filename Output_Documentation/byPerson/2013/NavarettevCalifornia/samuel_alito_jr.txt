justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
could
i
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
an
anonymous
tip?
suppose
somebody
calls
up
911
and
gives
a
name?
does
that
make
it
not
an
anonymous
tip?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
would
you
corroborate
it?
let's
say
the
person
calls
up
and
gives
a
name
and
gives
an
address?
so
what
would
be
necessary?
what
would
the
police
have
to
do
then
before
they
could
stop
the
vehicle
other
than
observing
the
vehicle
do
something
illegal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
transport
the
standard
that
applies
outside
of
the
vehicle
context
to
this
context,
what
would
happen
in
this
situation?
a
person
calls
up
and
says,
this
is
my
name,
this
is
my
address
and
it's,
it's
not
blocked
by
caller
id,
so
the
911
operator
can
see
that
that's
the
name,
that's
the
address.
the
person
says:
this
guy
ran
me
off
the
road.
the
police
find
the
vehicle.
they
drive
behind
the
vehicle
for
a
while.
they
don't
--
they
don't
see
any
--
they
don't
see
any
violation.
so
then
they
think,
well,
this
guy
must
have
lied.
so
are
they
are
going
to
prosecute
the
guy
for
calling
that
in?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
your
argument
goes
well
beyond.
you're
saying
this
has
to
do
with
anonymous
tips,
but
it
really
goes
well
beyond
anonymous
tips.
it
covers
tips
where
you
know
exactly
who
called
in,
and
what
you're
saying
is
they
really
can
never
stop
a
vehicle
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
tip
they
get,
unless
they
see
the
vehicle
committing
an
illegal
act.
that's
the
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
give
me
an
example
of
a
situation
in
which
the
police
can
pull
somebody
over
after
receiving
a
tip
without
actually
seeing
the
vehicle
commit
an
illegal
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
would
somebody
--
how
would
somebody
ever
be
able
--
who
observes
another
car
driving
ever
be
able
to
say
that
person
was
drunk?
all
they
could
--
all
they
could
observe
is
what
they
see.
they
don't
know
whether
the
person
--
what
is
causing
that
kind
of
behavior.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
is
it
limited
to
drunk
driving?
i
don't
understand
that.
i've
been
--
i've
been
on
an
expressway,
and
i've
had
people
go
by
me
at
--
they
went
by
in
a
blur.
they
must
have
been
going
well
over
a
hundred
miles
an
hour.
now,
if
the
police
catch
up
with
that
person,
of
course,
the
person's
going
to
slow
down
while
the
police
follow
the
person.
and
then
when
the
police
decide
to
stop,
they're
going
to
go
back
to
engaging
in
this
intentional,
extremely
dangerous
conduct.
so
i
don't
understand
why
there's
a
distinction
between
reporting
that
somebody
necessarily
is
driving
erratically,
so
the
person
may
be
impaired,
and
somebody
who
is
--
where
you
have
extremely
reckless
driving
that's
intentional.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
find
that
unsatisfactory
because
if
you
--
unless
you're
willing
to
say
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
bomb,
an
atomic
bomb,
a
little
bomb,
then
there
--
there
must
be
--
if
you're
going
to
draw
the
line
someplace,
then
you're
going
to
have
to
distinguish
between
those
reports
of
crimes
that
are
serious
enough
to
be
on
one
side
of
the
line
and
those
reports
of
a
crime
that
are
not
serious
enough
to
be
on
that
side
of
the
line.
you
either
have
to
go
all
the
way,
or
you
have
to
draw
a
line,
and
if
you're
going
to
draw
a
line,
i
would
like
to
know
where
the
line
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
forget
about
reasonable
suspicion.
just
can
it
be
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can
say
it
can
never
done,
even
if
it's
an
atomic
bomb,
even
if
it's
some
other
type
of
bomb.
you
can
say
that.
or
you
can
say,
no,
there's
a
line
someplace.
if
you're
going
to
say
there's
a
line
someplace,
then,
really,
i
think
you
need
to
tell
us
where
the
line
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
for
a
bomb.
for
any
kind
of
a
bomb?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
has
to
be
a
big
bomb.
