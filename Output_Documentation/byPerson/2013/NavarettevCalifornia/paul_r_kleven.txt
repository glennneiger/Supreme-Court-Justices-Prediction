mr.
paul
r
kleven
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
should
hold
that
officers
acting
on
anonymous
tips
must
corroborate
the
tips'
assertions
of
illegal
conduct
as
well
as
the
identifying
details
before
making
a
stop,
whether
that
tip
involves
erratic
driving,
illegal
gun
possession,
or
any
other
allegation
of
misconduct.
now,
the
state
proposes
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
rule
established
in
terry
v.
ohio,
which
courts
and
law
enforcement
officials
have
been
applying
now
for
more
than
40
years,
should
be
altered
so
that
now
it
applies
as
a
sliding
scale
where
the
level
of
suspicion
varies
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
an
anonymous
tipster
claims
someone
has
committed.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
reasonable
suspicion,
yes.
if
all
they
have
is
an
anonymous
tip
and
there
is
no
--
they
have
no
way
of
corroborating
any
of
the
--
any
of
the
innocent
details
except
that
they
can
identify
the
car,
then,
yes,
under--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--your
honor,
under
the
florida-j.
l.,
the
court
has
said
when
they
are
looking
--
when
all
that
they
are
able
to
corroborate
are
obvious
reasonably
observable
details,
such
as
that,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
the
court
to
go
beyond
that--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
there
is
that
exception,
your
honor.
and
in
florida-j.
l.
it
said
that
it
was
not,
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
required
on
the
facts
of
that
case
to
speculate
about
a
situation
where
such
a
serious
danger--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--your
honor,
that
would
not
make
a
difference.
however,
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
adjusting
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard,
the
court
should
not
address
that.
the
court
has
never
said--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--your
honor,
technically
it
would
not
be,
but
in
the
circumstances
here,
i
think
it
should
be
treated
as
an
anonymous
tip
because,
again,
the
name
could
be
false
when
the
tip
first
comes
in.
if
it's
corroborated
in
some
way,
then--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--again,
if
all
they
have
is
an
assertion
by
the
--
by
the
tipster
that
this
is
the
name
and
the
address,
if
the
officers
can
somehow,
again,
by
caller
identification
or
some
other
method
verify
that
in
fact
that
is
the
person
so
that
somewhere
down
the
line
that
person
will
be
held
accountable
for
a
false
tip,
then
it
can
be
treated
differently.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
no,
your
honor.
if
all
they
have
is
a
number,
then
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
use
that
as
a
basis
for--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
with
caller
id,
if
they
are
somehow
able
to
verify,
not
just
that
this
is
coming
from
this
phone,
but
that
in
fact
there's
a
particular
person
there,
if
they
can
identify
the
location,
that
sort
of
thing.
as
the
--
as
the
tip
gets
more
and
more
like
the
known
informant
in
the
adams
case,
then
the
officers
can
take
more
solace
in
the
fact
that
that
person
is
going
to
be
able
to
be
held
responsible.
in
adams,
of
course,
there's
a
situation
where
there
is
a
known
informant
who
can
be
arrested
immediately
if,
in
fact,
the
tip
turns
out
to
be
false.
the
problem
with
so
many
of
these
cases,
with
the
911
tape
--
911
caller,
is
that
even
if
--
is
that
there's
not
going
to
be
any
sort
of
accountability
even
if
they
do
manage
to
identify
the
person
in
terms
of
showing
the
tip
is
false
where
the
allegation,
for
example,
is
weaving.
there's
no
way
to
prove--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--no,
your
honor,
because
still
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
prosecute
them
because
the
fact
that
the
vehicle
is
now
not
weaving
doesn't
show
that
they
were
--
that
it
was
or
was
not
weaving--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
no,
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far,
your
honor.
i
think
as
the
tip
becomes
--
as
the
tip
contains
more
detail
and
as
the
tipster
becomes
more
accountable
for
a
false
tip,
again
getting
more
over
toward
the
adams
v.
kennedy,
then
at
some
point
the
anonymous
tip
would
be
or--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--i
think,
your
honor,
in
a
situation
where
the
caller
calls
in,
says
i'm,
i've
been
--
this
car
is
driving
erratically.
the
caller
then
says,
i'm
following
the
car.
now,
we're
at
such
and
such
a
location.
the
vehicle
has
just
done
something
else
that's
wrong
and
they
continue
to
follow
up
to
the
point
where,
okay,
i
can
now
see
the
patrol
car
coming
up,
again,
where
the
tipster
is
putting
his
or
her
credibility
on
the
line
and
becomes
more
and
more
accountable
towards
the
adams
v.
kennedy
known
informant,
then
if
you
add
that
together
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
then
you
will
have
a
situation
probably
to
do
it.
i
think
it's
going
to
be
rare,
and
i
think
it
should
be
rare
because
it
is
so
easy.
as
the
court
has
indicated,
the
court
has
shown
skepticism
for
anonymous
tips
because
the
tipsters
are
able
to
harass
other
people
without
running
any
risk
of
being
held
accountable
and
it
should
be
particularly
skeptical
in
the
case
of
anonymous
tips
about
erratic
driving,
because
with
the
ubiquitous
cell
phones,
it's
so
easy
for
somebody
who's
on
the
road,
who's
been
annoyed
by
somebody
else
to
just
pull
out
the
cell
phone
and
call
in
a
false
tip.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
there's
no
empirical
evidence
in
the
record.
however,
it
was
the
same
concern
that
led
the
court
in
j.l.
to
refuse
to
adopt
the
firearm
exception,
the
concern
that
making
it
so
easy
for
people
to
subject
others
to
the
harassment
of
a
--
of
a
stop
and
--
and
potential
--
potential
search
concerned
the
court
enough
that
it
denied
--
it
refused
to
adopt
the
firearm
exception.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
a
firearm
exception
--
we
have
an
exception
that's
being
requested
that's
doctrinally
the
same
as
a
firearm
exception.
there
--
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
drunk
driving
on
its
own
in
totality
presents
a
more
serious
threat
to
public
safety
than
--
than
firearms
do.
in
fact,
it--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--the
most
recent
--
the
most
recent
statistics
show
a
little
more,
about
11,000
people
die
from
homicides
by
firearms,
and
it's
usually
under
10,000
now
that
are
driving
--
dying
by
drunk
driving.
and
in
terms
of
public
safety,
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
people
who
die
as
a
result
of
drunk
driving
are
the
drunk
drivers
themselves.
so,
in
fact,
the
overall
threat
to
public
safety
is
not
as
great
when
you're
talking
about
drunk
driving
as
--
as
with
firearms.
and
the
court
indicated
in
j.l.
that
it
was
specifically
concerned
about
the
serious
threat
that
armed
criminals
pose
to
public
safety
and,
despite
that
serious
threat,
they
denied
--
the
court
denied
the
firearms
exception.
now,
what
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
i
don't
think
so
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
even
though
it's
diminished
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
in
the
home,
it's
--
in
j.l.,
of
course,
the
person
was
on
a
public
sidewalk;
the
person
was
not
in
the
home.
and
in
prouse,
the
court
talked
about
the
fact
that
in
modern
day
times,
people
--
a
lot
of
people
will
feel
more
of
a
sense
of
security,
they'll
feel
more
privacy
in
a
vehicle
than
they
would
out
on
the
street.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
your
honor,
in
the
sobriety
checkpoint
case,
the
court
has
looked
at
the
intrusion
and
found
that
to
be
at
the
very
rock
bottom
in
terms
of
intrusion,
the
fact
that
somebody
is
--
along
with
a
number
of
other
people,
that
they
have
to
submit
to
a
brief
stop,
it
has
put
that
on
the
lowest
--
on
the
lowest
level.
and
so
it's
a
--
the
court
has
not
approved
any
situation
where
individual
vehicles,
as
in
this
case,
are
pulled
over
without
reasonable
suspicion
that,
in
fact,
somebody
in
that
vehicle
is
engaged
in
--
in
criminal
activity.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
because
the
--
the
intrusion
is
greater,
your
honor.
and
the
martinez-fuentes
case
and
the
brignoni-ponce
case,
the
court
talked
about
the
very
minimal
intrusion
of
the
checkpoints
as
opposed
to
--
and
prouse
talks
about
this
also,
that
there
is
a
serious
intrusion
when
somebody
is
pulled
over.
you
have
the
activation
of
the
emergency
lights,
you
have
a
siren,
you're
pulled
over
possibly
in
a
neighborhood
where
--
where
you're
known
and
people
see
it,
possibly
out
in
the
middle
of
a
road
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
in
the
--
the
wells
case.
and
in
either
circumstance,
it
is
a
serious
intrusion
and
one
that
people
are
not
going
to
take
that
lightly.
so
it's
--
it's
a
different
situation.
and
the
court,
again,
if
they're
going
to
be
pulling
over
individual
cars,
signaling
them
out
for
--
for
stops
which
could,
under
the
court's
rules,
again,
the
driver,
all
the
passengers
can
be
ordered
out
of
the
car
if
--
if
the
terry
standards
are
met.
they
can--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--no,
your
honor.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
was
looking
at
in
florida
v.
j.l.--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
there
was
no
predictive
detail,
but
in
j.l.,
the
tip
was
a
young
black
male
in
a
plaid
shirt
at
a
bus
stop.
those
details
were
confirmed.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
it
was
--
it
was
possession--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
in
--
in
j.l.,
they
didn't
say
illegal
gun
possession,
but
presumably,
the
tipster
thought
it
was
an
illegal
gun
possession
and
the
officer
must
have
thought
it
was
illegal
gun
possession.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
what?
mr.
paul
r
kleven
oh,
it
was,
because
he
turned
out
to
be
under
21.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
i'll
agree
that
the
tipster
didn't
say
it,
but
i
think
the
assumption--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well
--
but
unless
--
unless
the
--
the
implication
is
that
the
gun
possession
is
illegal,
then
there's
no
reason
for
the
officer
to--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--hmm?
mr.
paul
r
kleven
but
if
--
if
the
tip
calls
--
if
the
tips
says
i'm
looking
at
a
case
of
gun
possession
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
is
perfectly
legal,
it's
like
in
this
case
if
the
tip
came
in
and
said:
i've
just
been
passed
by
a
car
whose
--
which
was
driven
very
skillfully,
there's
no
point
in
--
in
pursuing
the
tip
in
j.l.
unless
there's
some
--
some
element
of
illegality.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
okay.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
okay.
justice
sotomayor,
going
back
to
--
to
your
concern,
so
in
florida
v.
j.l.,
those
elements
were
--
were
confirmed
and
--
but
the
court
found
that
the
fact
that
those
elements
which
could
be
observable
by
anybody
who
was
looking
at
the
situation
and
probably
even
more
clearly
an
observation
where
the
plaid
shirt
was
identified,
that
that
didn't
give
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
was
also
being
truthful
in
talking
about
concealment.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
but
personal
knowledge--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--right.
there
was
no
indication
as
to
how
the
person
knew
about
the
gun.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
there
is
something
significant,
your
honor.
but,
by
itself,
that
just
gives
the
officers
some
reason
to
go
check
and
see
whether,
in
fact,
there's
a
chance
to
corroborate.
in
the
case
of
an
inebriated
driver,
the
fact
that
the
driver
is
inebriated
is
concealed
in
the
same
way
that
j.l.'s
gun
was
unless
there's
some
sort
of
erratic
driving
going
on.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
that's
all
they
have
to
go
on,
then
under
florida
v.
j.l.
they
would
not.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
if
--
in
terms
of
--
obviously,
it's
a
more
serious
situation,
but
the
court
has
not
held
that
the
seriousness--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
your
honor,
if
you're
talking
in
terms
of
just
the
seriousness
and
you're
looking
in
terms
of
the
florida
v.
j.l.
exception,
the
court
seemed
to
be
indicating
in
that
case
that
there
would
be
a
danger
that
was
so
extreme
where
the
court
would
find
a
search
or
a
stop
justified
without
any
showing
of--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
would
change
because,
again,
it's
just
the
--
the
seriousness
of
the
claim
should
not
affect
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
your
honor,
i
believe--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--i
believe,
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
florida
v.
j.l.,
that
may
be
a
situation,
again,
where
the
court
decides
that
--
that
the
risk
is
so
great--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--no.
but
it
would
not
be
--
it
should
not
change
--
it
should
not
be
in
terms
of
the
level
of
suspicion
required
under
--
under
terry.
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
should
not
change
on
that.
the
court
seemed
to
be
indicating
in
florida
v.
j.l.
that
at
some
point
the
level
of
danger
becomes
so
great
that,
in
fact,
there
was--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--your
honor,
what
i'm
saying,
in
either
of
those
situations,
the
court
may
want
to
consider
some
sort
of
exception
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
and
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
may
well
want
to
--
to
craft
some--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
let
me
start
off
by
saying,
if
i
could,
that
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
just
as
it
did
not
need
to
reach
that
question
in
j.l.--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--right.
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
again,
i
don't
know
what
particular
doctrine
the
court
would
--
would
choose,
but
i
think
that
probably
the
court
could
find
some
--
some
doctrine
that
would
allow
it
in
that
circumstance
to
find
it.
but
it
shouldn't
be
--
it
shouldn't
be
moving
toward
the
sliding
scale
element
in
--
that
--
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
except,
your
honor,
that,
in
fact,
when
we're
talking
about
drunk
driving,
whether
the
person
is
inebriated
or
not--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--right.
but
the
question
is,
your
honor,
is
the
person
inebriated
or
not,
to
take
the
--
the
state's
best
example.
and
that
--
that
issue,
that
is
a
concealed
element
of
criminal
behavior
unless
the
person
is
actually
driving
erratically.
if
the
person
is
driving
erratically
when
the
officers
appear,
then
there's
no
fourth
amendment
issue
and
it's
clear
that
they
have
either
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
to
pull
over
the
vehicle.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
and,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
concede
that
the
court
should
--
should
reduce
the
level
of
suspicion
for
reasonable
suspicion
in
order
to
do
that.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
r
kleven
what
i'm
saying,
your
honors,
is
the
state
is
arguing
for
a
sliding
scale
that
changes
things.
the
court
postulated
in
florida
v.
j.l.
a
situation
that
was
so
extreme,
that
was
so
unique,
that
the
court
might
decide
to
address
it
without
even
getting
into
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
but,
your
honor,
the
--
the
idea
of
running
off
the
road
is
concealed--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--i'm
not
disagreeing
with
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
what
i'm
saying
is
that
unless
the
person
is
still
driving
erratically
by
the
time
that
the
officers
arrive,
then
that
activity
is
concealed
in
the
same
way
that
the
question
of
whether
j.l.
had
a
gun
or
not
was
concealed.
you
can't
--
the
officers
can't
see
it
and,
therefore,
there's
no
reason
to
treat
this
case
any
differently
than
the
case
in
j.l.
they
have
to
be
able
to
see
something
like
erratic
driving
or
something
else
in
order
to
be
able
to
corroborate
that.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
your
honor,
absolutely
the
police
can
follow
that
car
and
that's
what
they
should
do.
and,
in
fact,
that's
what
they
did
here.
in
this
case,
there
was
a--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--right.
if
they
can't
see
any
erratic
driving
still
going
on,
then
where
is
it
going
to
go?
they're
not
going
to
prosecute
for
the
reckless
driving
that
allegedly
took
place
19
miles
away
and
they
have
followed
that
car
for
an
additional--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--other
than
that,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--but,
your
honor,
the
--
the
person
who's
making
the
claim
is
--
is
nowhere
to
be
found.
she's
gone.
there's
--
there's
nowhere
there.
so
there's
no
additional
investigation--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is,
yes,
they
have
to
verify
in
some
way
so
that
they
have
some
reason
to
believe
that,
in
fact,
the
person
that's
telling
them
this
is
actually
the
person
that
is
being
--
so
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
a
single
uncorroborated
tip
of
reckless
driving.
after
that
single
incident,
the
car
--
the
truck
went
for
approximately
19
miles
with
no
indication
of
any
other
problem
and
then
was
followed
for
up
to
5
miles
by
the
police
officers,
again
with
no
indication
of
any
erratic
driving
or
any
other
violation
that
would
have
been
a
reason
for
pulling
him
over
immediately.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
driver
of
this
truck
presented
any
kind
of
danger
about
being
about
to
lose
control,
which
is
the
argument
that
the
state
is
relying
on,
and
the
federal
government,
and
neither
one
of
them
came
up
with
any
anecdote
even
where
that
actually
occurred,
much
less
any
statistics
that
show
that
that
is
a
serious
problem
of
people
losing
control
while
they're
being
under
surveillance
by
the
police
officers.
this
case
is
even
farther
away
from
the
bomb
situation
than
j.l.
was.
in
j.l.,
you
had
a
person
who
was
armed,
who
could
have
pulled
out
a
gun
and
started
firing
at
any
moment.
here,
you
have
something
where
there's
no
indication
of
any
ongoing
risk
to
the
public.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
good
answer
to
the
bomb
question.
i
read
through
the
transcript
from
the
oral
argument
in
j.l.
i
didn't
see
any
--
you
know,
there
didn't
seem
to
be
any
good
arguments
--
any
good
discussions
there
either,
as
to
which
way
the
court
could
go.
but
this
case
--
in
j.l.,
the
court
said
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
resolve
that.
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
a
situation
where
that
would
happen.
in
this
case,
i
submit,
there's
even
less
reason
for
the
court
to
speculate
about
the
bomb
situation
or
even
the
kidnapping
situation.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
your
honor,
except
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
the
line
in
terms
of
reasonable
suspicion
because
then,
you're
going
to
have
this--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
certainly,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--your
honor,
i
think
the
line
is
certainly,
when
we
get
into
the
bomb
situation,
but
not
in
terms
of
reasonable
suspicion.
the
severity
of
the
crime
does
not
affect
it,
but
the
court
could
fashion
a
rule
that
would
say
there's
an
exception
in
this
case
that
would
apply.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
if
--
if
there's
a
call
in
that--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--that
says
a
white
--
a
white
prius
has
a
bomb,
you
know,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
sort
of
case
under
the
--
under
the
circumstances
where
this
court
would
find
a
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
paul
r
kleven
well--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
those
--
those
are
two
significant
distinctions,
certainly,
between
the
--
the
bomb
analogy
and
the
situation,
even
in
the
drunken
driving
situation,
where
you
don't
have
anybody
who
is
intentionally
trying
to
harm
anyone
and
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
is
--
is
much
greater.
the--
mr.
paul
r
kleven
--well,
in
terms
of
their
--
their
decision
to
get
drunk,
there's
intent
there.
in
terms
of,
by
the
time
the
officer
becomes
aware
of
it,
there's
no
indication
that
that
drunk
driver
is
going
down
the
road
trying
to
harm
somebody.
there
is
an
indication
that
they
may
be
too
--
too
inebriated
to
be
driving
properly,
and
police
officers
are
pulling
people
over
for
that
situation
since
the
car
was
invented,
and
they're
really
good
at
it.
