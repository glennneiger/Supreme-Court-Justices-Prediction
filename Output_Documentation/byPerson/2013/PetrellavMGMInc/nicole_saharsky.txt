ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
courts
below
were
right
to
bar
this
suit
entirely
on
laches
ground.
and
on
that
question,
we
agree
entirely
with
petitioner,
that
the
suit
should
not
have
been
barred
at
the
outset.
but
it
is
the
government's
view
that
laches
is
available
in
extraordinary
cases
to
bar
copyright
infringement
claims
brought
within
the
statute
of
limitations
for
2
reasons.
first
of
all,
laches,
like
equitable
tolling
and
other
equitable
principles,
was
a
background
principle
that
congress
acted
against
when
it
enacted
the
statute
of
limitations
and
it
said
nothing
to
bar
it.
we've
already
had
the
discussion
here
at
court
today
about
the
text
and
how
it
doesn't
bar
it.
but
second,
for
the
reasons
that
justice
kagan
gave,
the
copyright
situation
is
unique
in
that
there
is
this
separate
accrual
rule
which
allows
a
person
to
sue
many
years
after
the
infringing
conduct
started
so
that
it
makes
sense
to
at
least
be
able
to
consider
laches.
now,
our
view,
though--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
we
would
distinguish
between
equitable
relief
and
legal
relief.
and
that's
because
that
distinction
was
well
established
in
the
courts
of
equity
and
in
the
courts
of
law
and
post
merger
at
the
time
this
court
enacted
in
1957.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
because
the
history
is
different.
the
history
that
this
court
recognized
in
cases
like
mack,
for
example,
1935
case,
where
that
was
a
legal
claim.
the
court
said,
laches
within
a
term
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
is
no
defense
at
law.
and
the
court
has
continued
to
pick
up
that
language
in
case
after
case.
there
are
numerous
cases
cited
in
the
briefs.
there
was
a
1985--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--because
this
is
a
statutory
claim
that
--
and
a
statute
of
limitations
that
congress
put
in
place.
and
the
question
is:
what
is
the
background
rule
against
which
congress
was
acting?
congress
could
change
the
background
rule,
but
because
this
is
a
statutory
action,
it's
for
congress
to
do
it
as
opposed
to
the
court.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
what
i'm
saying
is
specific
to
the
laches
defense,
and
what
i'm
saying
there
is
that
there
is
a
long
history
that
laches
did
not
apply
at
law
and
that
this
court
has
continued
to
recognize
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
but
i'm
saying--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
saying
that
in
the
laches
context,
we
are
not
aware
of
any
instances
in
which
this
court
has
used
laches
to
bar
a
claim
at
law--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
two
--
two
responses
to
that.
first,
as
a
general
matter,
we
think
it
makes
sense
for
the
laches
defense
to
apply
in
--
in
fashioning
equitable
relief
because
that
is
a
place
where
judges
are
exercising
discretion.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
okay.
in
terms
of
the
practical
offense,
the
--
the
copyright
act
statute
specifies
the
particular
remedies
that
are
available
and
it's
fairly
clearly
distinguished
between
legal
and
equitable
remedies.
the
legal
remedies
are
actual
or
statutory
damages,
and
those
are
limited
to
the
past
three
years.
and
then
the
equitable
remedies
are
the
profits
of
the
defendant,
the
essentially
unjust
enrichment
of
defendant,
and
then
as
you
mentioned,
justice
breyer,
the
injunction
situation.
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
if
--
if
a
plaintiff
has
established
copyright
infringement,
that
it's
an
all
or
nothing
on
injunctions.
this
court
recognized
in
ebay--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
trying
to.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
case
if
infringement
were
shown.
this
court,
for
example,
recognized
in
the
new
york
versus
kissimmee
case,
that
in
fashioning
injunctive
relief,
it's
not
just
that
you
give
an
injunction
or
you
don't
give
an
injunction,
it
could
be
the
case
that
in
a
situation
like
this
one,
for
example,
the
court
could
say,
i
will
allow
the
defendant
to
continue
with
these
contracts
that
it
has
entered
into
to
continue
using
this
film
as
a
derivative
work,
but
i
will
pay
a
reasonable
royalty
or
i
will
put
forth
--
call
for
a
reasonable
royalty
to
the
plaintiff.
so
there
is
some
splitting
of
the
difference
available
to
the
court
in
fashioning
equitable
remedies.
so
i
don't
think
the
court--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
these
are
two
different
remedies.
there's
the
profits
of--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
that
both
are
susceptible
to
the
court's
equitable
consideration.
the
profits,
the
way
that
that
is
addressed
in
the
copyright
act
is
that
it
is
the
profits
of
the
defendant,
and
you
subtract
out
what
the
defendant
contributed.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
they
are
related,
but
different.
laches
involves
sitting
on
your
rights
to
the
detriment
of
the
defendant,
whereas
equitable
estoppel
involves
affirmative
--
affirmative
things
but
the
plaintiff
has--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
you're
right
that
laches
can
--
is
a
cousin
of
equitable
estoppel
and
that
it's
right
that
equitable
estoppel
could
bar
the
claim
entirely.
the
reason
that
we
are
distinguishing
between
law
and
equity
are
two
reasons:
first
of
all,
there
is
a
very
long
history
that
laches
is
unique
to
the
courts
of
equity,
and
this
court
has
recognized
it.
it
recognized
it
in
mack,
it
recognized
in
the
oneida
case,
it
recognized
it
in
merck,
it
was
in
the
pomeroy
treatise
that
this
was
a
classic
division
that
was
only
in
equity.
and
this
court
has
continued
to
recognize
it.
but
the
second
reason
is
that
it
makes
sense
to
look
to
laches
principles
in
fashioning
equitable
relief
in
this
context
as
opposed
to
the
legal
relief,
because
under
the
copyright
act,
when
a
person
shows,
a
plaintiff
shows
infringement,
that
person
is
entitled
to
actual
or
statutory
damages
in
a
certain
amount.
and
that
is
a
mechanical
calculation
that
we
expect
juries
to
make.
but
it's
not
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--you're
right
that
there
is
that
difference.
the
patent
act
is
different
in
several
respects.
first
of
all
in
terms
of
the
time
period,
it
doesn't
have
a
statute
of
limitations
in
which
--
after
which
a
claim
is
barred.
it
says
that
you
can
only
recover
damages
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
there's
actually
a
shorter
period
of
limitation,
or
a
shorter
period
of
protection
in
the
patent
act,
and
you
have
the
patent
act
time
period
that
was
enacted
well
before
the
copyright
period
here.
so
we
think
that
the
patent
context
is
different,
but
i
take
your
point
that
the
analysis
that
the
federal
circuit
underwent
is
not
the
same
type
of
analysis
that
we
are
undertaking
now.
ours
is
based
on
the
background
principle
on
which
congress
acted,
as
opposed
to
that
analysis,
which
was
more
on
policy
grounds.
thank
you.
