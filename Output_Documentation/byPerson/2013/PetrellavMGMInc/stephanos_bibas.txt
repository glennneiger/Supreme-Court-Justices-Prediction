mr.
stephanos
bibas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
never
applied
laches
to
constrict
a
federal
statute
of
limitations,
and
rejected
such
a
claim
just
four
years
ago.
laches
cannot
bar
these
copyright
infringement
claims
for
four
reasons:
first,
under
the
separate
accrual
rule,
these
claims
are
timely.
respondents
committed
these
discrete
wrongs
from
2006
on,
but
would
use
petitioner's
failure
to
challenge
earlier
wrongs
to
foreclose
these
later
claims
before
they
even
arose.
second,
laches
is
a
gap
filler,
but
congress
filled
this
gap
with
a
bright-line
statute
of
limitations.
third,
congress
chose
a
clear,
predictable
timeliness
rule.
and
fourth,
injunctive
relief
must
remain
available
to
protect
petitioner's
property
right
against
ongoing
violations,
less
respondents
effectively
get
a
compulsory
license
for
free
for
the
next
four
decades.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes.
the
wording
of
a
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--this
is
not
purely
about
the
text,
but
about
the
background
principle
of
equity
that
laches
is.
laches
domain
was
as
a
gap
filler
where
there
was
no
--
no
timeliness
rule.
congress
has
occupied
the
field
with
a
timeliness
rule
here
and
displaced
it.
that's
why
laches
developed
in
equity
to
compensate
for
the
absence
of
limitation
periods.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
not
where
there
was
a
binding,
a
federal
one.
where
there
was
an
analogous
one
that
was
borrowed
loosely
from
a
state
in
diversity,
federal
courts
understood
themselves
to
have
flexibility
to
vary
from
the
state
limitation
period
because
it
wasn't
federal
law.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
this
was
in
the
pre-erie
days
where
there
was
an
understanding
that
there
was
a
general
federal
common
law,
an
equity,
that
those
cases
were
decided.
that
--
this
court
in
holmberg
v.
armbrecht
understood
this
almost
as
a
chevron-type
argument.
has
congress
spoken
to
the
timeliness
issue?
if
yes,
holmberg
says
the
congressional
statute
is
definitive.
if
not,
holmberg
says
then
its
silence
delegates
the
matter
to,
quote,
‶
judicial
implication
″.
and
then
there's
some
judicial
flexibility
on
timeliness
issues.
there's
no
question
that
nontimeliness
doctrines
can
cut
times
off
within
the
limitations
period,
but
not
the
timeliness
doctrine
of
laches.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor.
that's
why--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
why
i
said
it's
not
strictly
a
textual
argument.
it's
about
the
domain
of
laches
and
the
congressional
understanding
of
limitations
periods.
that's
what
--
how
this
court
read
them
in
the
ledbetter
case.
if
i
might
quote,
"a
freestanding
violation
may
always
be
charged
within
its
own
charging
period,
regardless
of
its
connection
to
other
violations.
"
we
repeated
the
same
point
more
recently
in
morgan.
quote:
"the
existence
of
past
acts
and
the
employee's
prior
knowledge
of
their
occurance.
"
"does
not
bar
employees
from
filing
charges
about
related
discrete
acts,
so
long
as
the
acts
are
independently
discriminatory
and
charges
addressing
those
acts
are
themselves
timely
filed.
"
this
court's
understanding
in
morgan
and
in
ledbetter
was
the
period
is
to
remain
open
and
timeliness
doctrines
are
not
to
cut
them
short
because
those
doctrines,
such
as
laches,
are
where
there
isn't
a
binding
congressional
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
the
timeliness
doctrines
of
tolling
and
the
discovery
rule
are
distinguishable.
this
court
understands
that
when
congress
--
tolling
and
discovery
rules
developed
in
order
to
interpret
limitations
periods.
you
cannot
have
a
tolling
or
discovery
rule
without
a
limitations
period
to
interpret.
so
this
court
has
said
it's
an
accoutrement.
it's
intertwined
with
interpreting
the
word
‶
accrues
″
for
a
discovery
rule,
or
interpreting
"3
years.
"
"do
you
count
the
period
of
infancy?
"
"do
you
count
saturdays
or
sundays?
"
"it
interprets
the
statute
of
limitations.
"
mr.
stephanos
bibas
tolling
has
always
been
used--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--right.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
well,
first,
briefly,
respondents
concede
there
are
no
words
in
this
act
that
even
give
a
toehold
for
laches.
but
second,
the
state
of
the
law
in
1957
and
to
this
day
is
that
tolling
and
discovery
rules
were
long
background
periods
for
interpreting
limitations
rules.
laches
has
never
been.
this
court--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
not
only
the
words
of
section
2072(b)
that
you
may
not
"enlarge,
abridge,
or
modify
any
substantive
right.
"
but
this
court's
holding
in
grupo
mexicano
recognized
that
the
historical
limits
on
equitable
remedies
are
limited
to
where
they
were
at
the
times--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i
point
to
this
court's
having
repeatedly
rejected
that
extension
in
mack
and
then
russell
and
holmberg
and
oneida
and
merck
just
4
years
ago.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
laches
cannot
shorten
the
statutes
of
limitations,
it's
not
applicable,
especially
since--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
very
salient
that
this
is
the
copyright
act,
an
act
with
detailed
statutory
safeguards
against
financial
and
evidentiary
prejudice.
moreover,
copy
--
the
copyright
is
a
property
right
registered
with
the
government
with
a
clear
registry
that
wants
clear,
simple,
predictable,
easy-to-apply
rules.
that's
the
policy
of
the
'76
copyright
act.
and
this
court's
case
law
in
the
trademark
context
from
the
late
19th
century
says,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
property
right
that
extends
into
the
future,
injunctive
relief
has
to
remain
available
to
vindicate
that
property
right,
unless
there
is
something
that
rises
to
the
level
of
a
distinct
defense,
an
abandonment
or
an
estoppel.
but
the--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
you're
correct
that
the
copyright
act
has
provisions
that
forbid
adverse
possession,
that
require
transfers
to
be
in
writing.
and
so
the
right
itself
can't
be
defeated.
so
i
agree
with
your
premise.
now,
as
to
how
that
bears
on
injunctive
relief,
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
an
injunction
must
automatically
issue.
this
court
in
ebay
said
very
clearly
it
mustn't,
but
one
must
look
at
the
traditional
test
for
equitable
relief.
and
one
of
the
factors
in
that
test
is
prejudice
to
the
defendant,
but
it
must
be
balanced
against
prejudice
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
public
interest.
and
that
is
foreclosed
if
one
uses
laches
as
a
threshold
bar.
it's
foreclosed
if
one
uses
it
as
a--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--we
certainly
agree
that
we're
entitled
to
damages
going
forward,
but
we
don't
agree
that
that's
exclusive
because
i
--
i'd
point
to
the
chief
justice's
concurrence
in
the
ebay
case.
a
copyright
is
a
property
right.
it
comes
with
the
right
to
exclude
presumptively.
that
right
cannot
necessarily
be
fully
enforced
in
all
circumstances,
but
presumptively,
it
ought
to
remain
on
the
table
to
enforce
with
injunctive
relief.
now,
you
are
correct
respondents
have
entered
into
commercial
agreements
--
arrangements
for
the
next
2
years.
it
would
be
reasonable
for
a
court
sitting
in
equity
to
say,
let's
balance
the
hardships.
the
hardships
between
now
and
2015
might
look
different
from
the
hardships
in
2015
until
the
middle
of
the
21st
century.
we
might
tailor
the
duration
and
the
scope
of
injunctive
relief
to
save
some
damages,
some
royalties
for
a
few
years,
but
that's
not
a
reason
to
defeat
her
right
to
exclude
for
the
next
four
decades.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
i
think
your
considerations
cut
in
favor
of
our
position.
whether
our
client
brings
suit
now
or
20
years
from
now,
she
gets
three
and
only
three
years'
damages.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
creative
works
are
worth
the
most
right
after
they're
released.
and
so
the
value
of
the
claim
goes
down.
respondents
get
to
keep
the
first
17
years
of
profits
if
she
waits.
so
she
has
every
incentive,
as
the
amicus
briefs
indicate,
to
file
suit
early.
and,
indeed,
courts
can
use
adverse
inferences
against
plaintiffs
who
delay,
draw
inferences
and
missing
witness
instructions
from
their
delay.
but
let
me
point
out
that
there
are
plenty
of
situations
in
which
there
is
a
delay
in
suit.
take
bay
area
laundry.
take
a
standard
30-year
mortgage.
the
mortgagee
who
waits
until
year
20
doesn't
get
to
claim
20
years'
worth
of
payments,
but
there's
nothing
that
debars
that
mortgagee
from
claiming
payments
for
years
17
to
20.
it
would
radically
upend
the
law
to
say
that.
and
to
come
back
to
your
point
that
we
don't
see
laches
in
these
cases,
that
again
cuts
our
direction.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
under
the
copyright
act,
they
are
entitled
to
deduct
all
the
expenses
that
are
attributable
to
earning
the
profits
from
infringement.
so
plaintiffs
don't
get
a
dime
until
respondents
recoup
those
expenses.
moreover,
one
who
has
notice
of
a
registered
copyright
in
the
face
of
protest
has
no
legitimate
good
faith
expectation
to
continue
to
infringe.
either
file
a
declaratory
judgment
act,
engage
in
settlement
negotiations
or
infringe
at
your
peril.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
thank
you,
your
honor.
five
points.
first,
justice
sotomayor
was
entirely
right
that
holmberg,
russell,
mack
and
merck
just
four
years
ago
make
this
settled
law.
there
is
a
reason
justice
kagan
says
that
we
can't
see
laches
in
cases
like
this.
we
don't
see
it
foreclosing
ongoing
and
future
wrongs.
we've
never
seen
laches
used
to
measure
the
delay
before
the
wrong
occurred
to
foreclose
ongoing
and
future
claims.
laches
is
normally
about
the
delay
between
the
wrong
and
the
suit.
and
this
invented
category
of
rolling
statutes
of
limitations,
this
court
in
klehr
carefully
distinguished
separately
accruing
discrete
wrongs
within
a
limitations
period
from
continuing
violations
that
reach
back
beyond
the
limitations
period
to
claim
damages
beyond
that.
when
my
friend
says
we
could
have
brought
this
exact
same
suit
in
1991,
he
is
absolutely
incorrect.
if
they
had
stopped
infringing
in
2005,
the
entire
statutory
penalty
for
my
client
would
have
been
no
recovery
from
1991
until
2005.
second,
the
only
two
precedents
my
friend
can
rely
upon
from
this
court,
in
the
face
of
a
wall
of
precedent
noted
by
justice
sotomayor,
are
morgan
and
bay
area
laundry.
bay
area
laundry
had
a
statutory
provision,
29
u.s.c.
1399(b)(1),
that
required
an
employer
to
bring
claims
as
soon
as
practical.
the
only
context
in
which
there
was
an
aside
in
that
case,
not
even
an
application
of
holding,
was
saying
that
as
soon
as
practical
is
a
laches-like
doctrine.
the
only
case
that
looks
remotely
close
that
my
friend
cites
in
his
brief
is
the
morgan
case.
and
morgan
is
completely
distinguishable
for
two
reasons:
the
first
is
morgan
involved
bootstrapping
damages
from
beyond
the
limitations
period,
claiming
damages
from
before
the
180
or
300-day
filing
period.
we
claim
no
damages
before
2006.
second,
my
friend
is
absolutely
incorrect
in
saying
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
in
morgan.
title
7
contains
no
statute
of
limitations.
it
contains
a
filing
timeliness
requirement.
one
of
the
pillars
of
this
court's
decision
in
morgan
is,
you
can
reach
back
for
damages
for
two
years
as
shown
by
the
backpay
provision.
since
we
don't
have
a
limit
on
damages,
we
might
possibly
consider
a
limit
--
a
laches-like
limitation
in
a
future
case.
that
was
not
the
holding.
it
was
not
briefed
and
argued,
but
there
was
a
mention
of
it.
so
morgan
was
not
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations.
and
when
this
court
interpreted
it
in
ledbetter,
it
understood
morgan
is
about
continuing
violations
rescuing
untimely
claims
for
untimely
damages
before
limitations
period.
the
lower
courts
my
friend
refers
to,
by
the
way,
he
and
i
have
jointly
not
found
a
single
case
that
was
entirely
barred
in
the
second,
sixth,
tenth,
or
eleventh
circuits.
in
the
cases
that
adopt
a
--
the
circuits
that
adopt
a
rare
case
standard,
in
theory
leaving
the
door
open,
they
have
not
cited
and
we
have
not
found
in
the
sixth,
tenth,
or
eleventh
circuit
a
single
case
that
found
that
standard
met
as
to
damages
or
injunctive
relief.
and,
yes,
we
do
claim
damages.
our
complaint,
joint
appendix
30
claims
damages.
joint
appendix
34,
the
prayer
for
relief
is
phrased
in
terms
of
damages,
not
an
accounting
for
profits.
third,
justice
--
oh,
and
by
the
way,
the
posner
opinion
that
was
cited
said
that's
only
because
there's
no
statutory
limitations
period.
there's
no
congressional
separation
of
powers
problem
because
under
the
statute
interpreted
in
that
posner
opinion,
there
was
no
statutory
limitation
period
by
congress.
third,
justice
kennedy's
point
about
estoppel
as
a
cousin.
it
is
not
a
twin.
first,
you
can
have
an
estoppel
after
a
one-week
delay.
estoppel
has
no
element
requiring
delay.
laches
requires
a
long
delay.
estoppel
requires
affirmative,
intentional
misconduct
causing
loss.
i'd
point
out
those
elements
are
substantially
more
stringent.
moreover,
estoppel,
like
tolling
and
discovery
rule,
were
settled
law
as
of
1957.
tolling
and
discovery
rule
were
cited
in
the
legislative
history
by
the
legal
advisor
to
the
copyright
office.
but
the
holmberg
case
that
was
cited
to
that
court
said
very
different
rule
is
the
background
rule
as
to
laches.
no
laches
within
the
congressional
law
period.
finally,
let
me
point
out
that
because
estoppel
was
settled,
it
remains
available
to
catch
the
worst
cases
of
prejudice.
it
remains
available
for
the
manipulative
scenarios
outlined
by
my
friend.
fourth
point,
uncertainty.
i
think
it's
quite
salient
that
justice
kagan
pointed
out
that
if
we
were
to
recognize
laches
here,
for
the
first
time,
for
the
first
time
within
the
congressional
statute
of
limitations,
we'd
open
a
whole
new
field
of
litigation
over
laches.
when
do
i
file?
this
court
just
a
week
ago
in
the
ray
haluch
gravel
opinion
said
timeliness
rules
need
to
be
clear,
simple,
predictable.
parties
need
to
know
when
to
file.
we
frequently
see
plaintiffs
filing
on
or
shortly
before
the
day
the
limitation
period
expires.
if
this
court
were
to
cloud
that,
then
there'd
be
a
rush
of
preemptive
litigation
coming
into
court.
moreover,
i
think
justice
breyer's
point
is
quite
right.
you
shouldn't
have
to
file
15
damages
suits
one
after
another.
from
blackstone
to
story
to
the
marshall
court,
one
of
the
principles
of
equity
was
you
don't
have
to
keep
filing
injunctive
relief.
