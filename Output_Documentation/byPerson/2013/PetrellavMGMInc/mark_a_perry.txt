mr.
mark
a.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
agrees
with
us
that
the
1957
amendment
did
not
abrogate
the
laches
doctrine.
since
that's
the
only
question
presented,
we
submit
the
court
should
affirm.
now,
the
government
has
gone
at
great
length
about
this
law-equity
distinction.
the
copyright
act
of
1909
in
section
27
abolished
the
distinction
between
law
and
equity
for
copyright
purposes,
section
27
of
the
1909
act.
the
law
and
equity
act
of
1915
abolished
the
same
distinction
for
all
civil
actions.
it
says:
"in
any
action
at
law,
all
equitable
defenses
may
be
asserted.
"
and
if
one
looks
in
black's,
for
example,
a
reactive
source,
not
a
predictive
source,
what
is
an
equitable
defense,
it
says
"a
defense
formerly
available
at
equity,
now
available
in
all
actions.
"
and
examples
are
unclean
hands,
laches,
and
estoppel.
that's
in
the
black's
law
dictionary.
and
then
this
court,
after
the
rules
enabling
act,
justice
scalia,
of
1934
--
which
is
different,
by
the
way,
than
2072
in
the
current
statute.
the
'34
version,
which
is
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
broke
out
law
and
equity,
retained
this
court's
equitable
powers,
and
authorized
the
court
to
merge
them.
and
in
rule
8,
this
court
surveyed
the
available
defenses--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
sotomayor,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
steps.
the
morgan
case
involved
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
applied
laches
or
said
laches
was
available
five
times,
and
that's
an
action
at
law.
that
plaintiff
brought
a
claim
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
so
that's
the
most
recent
version
where
all
of
those
things
are
not
true
that
the
petitioner
says.
also,
the--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
this
court
said
that
laches
was
available
five
times.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
it
wasn't
raised,
your
honor.
that
point
wasn't
raised.
this
court
said
over
five
times
that
where
you
have
a
rolling
statute
of
limitations,
laches
is
a
necessary
protection
for
the
defendant
because
the
events
may
move
so
far
away
from
the
underlying
facts,
which
is
very
true
here.
the
holmberg
case
is
in
many
ways
our
best
case,
justice
sotomayor.
let's
look
at
what
holmberg
said.
holmberg
was,
remember,
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
congress,
somebody
in
congress
focused
on
it.
it
says,
first,
when
congress
leaves
to
the
federal
courts
the
formulation
of
remedial
details,
it
can
hardly
expect
them
to
break
with
historic
principles
of
equity.
and
we
know
from
both
the
house
and
the
senate
report
this
1957
statute
specifically
said
the
remedial
details
are
up
to
the
court
because
we
want
the
courts
to
continue
to
apply
equity
considerations.
so
what
are
those
equitable
principles?
this
court
went
on
in
holmberg
and
said:
first,
a
suit
in
equity
may
fail
though
not
barred
by
the
act
of
limitations.
that's
a
pretty
clear
equitable
principle
and,
of
course,
we
win
this
case
under
that
principle.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
articulated
the
goose
and
gander
rule,
that
these
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin;
that
laches
and
tolling
go
together.
they
travel
together.
they
are
not
cousins,
justice
kennedy.
they
are
fraternal
twins.
you
don't
get
one
without
the
other.
and
what
the
court
said
is
if
want
of
due
diligence
by
the
plaintiff
may
make
it
unfair
to
pursue
the
defendants,
laches,
then
also
fraudulent
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
may
make
it
unfair
for
the
plaintiff
to
proceed.
fraudulent
concealment.
and
then
the
court
said
--
and
this
is
the
critical
point
--
it
cited
bailey
v.
glover,
which
also
had
the
goose-and-gander
rule
embedded
in
it.
it
said
this
equity
doctrine
is
read
into
every
federal
statute
of
limitations;
not
fraudulent
concealment,
but
the
twin
nature
of
tolling
plus
laches,
that
every
time
the
courts
have
the
power
to
adjust
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
parties
using
their
equitable
powers,
that
happens
on
the
front
end
and
on
the
back
end.
my
friend,
mr.
bibas,
has
to
respond
to
that
by
saying:
tolling
is
available,
discovery
is
available,
waiver,
abandonment,
acquiescence,
estoppel
and
all
of
the
other
equitable
doctrines,
eight
of
which
are
listed
in
rule
8
that
this
court
has
determined
are
available
in
all
civil
actions.
but,
he
says,
laches
--
which
this
court
also
listed
in
rule
8,
is
not
available
in
this
civil
action.
that
is
a
bizarre
argument,
your
honor,
and
it
has
no
support
whatsoever.
this
court
confronted
the
same
point
--
excuse
me.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
kagan,
the
congress
cited
holmberg
which
cites
patterson
as
the
leading
laches
case,
and
cites
russell
as
well,
and
patterson
dealt
with
this
very
point.
patterson,
which
did
hold--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--i'm
sorry.
the
committee
reports
cite
the
holmberg
case,
not
congress.
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
patterson
case,
however,
squarely
held
--
and,
justice
sotomayor,
this
goes
to
your
question
too
--
that
a
claim
brought
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
a
state
statute
borrowed
for
a
federal
claim,
and
this
involved
property,
a
copyright,
this
involved
a
gold
mine,
and
it's
exactly
analogous.
what
happened
there
is,
the
plaintiff
sat
around,
had
a
part
interest
in
the
gold
mine,
sat
around
and
waited
until
somebody
else
developed
it
enough
to
make
a
profit
and
then
rushed
in
and
demanded
a
share.
that
is
what
ms.
petrella
did
in
this
case.
she
is
demanding
her
share
in
the
gold
mine
after
my
clients
spent
years
developing
it,
okay?
what
congress--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that
is
not
exactly
clear,
your
honor.
she
sued
in
january
of
2009
to
pick
up
the
profits
back
to
january
of
2006.
the
biggest
investment
was
in
2005
for
the
25th
anniversary
edition.
we
think
she's
going
to
go
into
to
court
and
say,
"i
don't
have
to
offset
that
because
it's
more
than
three
years
old.
"
so
that
she
wants
only
--
she
wants
to
skim
the
cream.
she
gets
to
look
back
and
pick
her
three--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--because,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
on
a
net
basis,
the
film
still
has
never
made
a
profit
for
when--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--two
answers,
your
honor.
first,
congress
looked
at
that.
and
this
is
the
reason
that
the
statutory
damages
remedy
is
in
the
statue:
to
encourage
rights
asserters
to
early
go
into
court
and
establish
priority
and
availability
of
the
rights
if
they
have
them.
so
if
there
are
no
profits,
if
there
are
no
damages
--
of
course,
this
plaintiff
has
no
damages.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
because,
your
honor,
we
sent
--
she
made
a
demand
which
we
refused.
we
get
lots
of
demands
and
we
refuse
them.
and
the
last
letter
in
the
series
was,
‶
you
have
no
claim
″.
then
she
did
nothing.
actually,
she
did
more
than
nothing.
she
showed
up
as
our
guest
at
a
party
for
the
25th
anniversary
suggesting
that
she
agreed
with
our
interpretation
of
this.
and
then
she
didn't
sue
for
years
and
years
later.
the
events
in
question
--
the
reason
that
the
three
year
--
the
ruling
of
three
years
is,
as
in
a
title
7
case,
what's
not
being
litigated
in
this
case
if
it
were
to
go
to
trial
is
the
last
three
years.
it's
1961,
'62
and
'63.
whenever
the
film
was
released
--
the
disputed
events
happened
in
the
early
1960s,
so
that
every
year
she
waits,
for
her
own
strategic
reasons,
she's
getting
farther
away
from
those
events.
and
this
court
answered
the
same
point
in
patterson
about
the
mine.
it
said,
of
course
you
can
apportion
the
profits
to
account
for
the
investment,
but
you
can
never
--
you
can
never
reimburse
the
developers
for
the
risk
of
getting
naught.
you
can
never
reimburse
them
for
the
work
they
did
while
she
was
sitting
on
the
sidelines
and,
therefore,
at
some
point,
the
reliance
interest
was
so
great.
and
then
we
haven't
talked
yet
about
the
evidentiary
prejudice.
these
cases
get
so
old,
the
witnesses
have
died.
they
are
unavailable.
and
she
is
now
trying
to
tell
the
court,
the
courts,
the
judicial
system,
that
her
father
lied
in
a
written
representation,
yet
her
mother,
who
could
have
testified
to
that,
has
passed
on.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
sotomayor,
she
still
has
her
copyright.
she
can
enforce
it
against
the
world.
and
she
still
has
a
contractual
right
with
mgm
in
which
she
will
get
participation
rights
pursuant
to
the
contract.
she
wants
to
renegotiate
that
contract.
that's
what
this
case
about.
she
could
have
done
that
in
1991.
she
could
have
brought
this
lawsuit
in
1991.
we
are
not
seeking
to
task
her
with
her
father's
death
or
anything
that
happened
before
1991.
after
1991,
however,
mr.
lamotta,
key
witness
as
to
the
collaboration
of
the
1963
screenplay
has
become
unavailable
to
testify.
vickie
lamotta,
who
could
have
established
our
defense
that
the
screenplay
reflects
real
life
rather
than
imaginary
events,
because
she
is
a
central
character
in
that,
passed
away.
and
mrs.
petrella,
who
--
if
you
read
paula
petrella's
declaration,
she
says,
"my
mother
was
up
late
at
night
typing
something.
"
implying
that
it
was
the
book
--
had
she
sued
in
1991,
we
would
have
put
her
mother
under
oath
and
said,
‶
what
were
you
typing
″?
and
she
would
have
said,
‶
the
screenplay
″
or
something
else.
she
would
not
have
said
the
book,
we
believe,
but
we
can't
ask
her
that
question
because
she
waited
long
enough
for
all
the
witnesses,
not
her
father,
all
the
other
witnesses
who
have
percipient
knowledge
to
pass
away.
and
latches
is
a
prejudice
doctrine.
it's
not
a
timeliness
doctrine.
it
requires
delay
as
a
trigger,
but
it
turns
on
prejudice,
and
it's--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor.
first,
i
think
they
spoke
of
a
presumption
and
didn't
apply
it
and
certainly
the
district
court
didn't--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--this
court,
justice
kagan,
in
the
foster
vs.
mansfield
case
in
1892
said
--
and
i
quote
--
after
ten
years,
quote,
"there
is
certainly
a
presumption
of
laches
which
is
incumbent
on
the
plaintiff
to
rebut.
"
which
is
the
same
concept
that
the
ninth
circuit
articulated,
although
we
submit,
did
not
apply.
in
the
federal
circuit
in
the
akerman
case
very
carefully
explained
what
this
means.
it's
a
federal
rule
of
evidence
301
type
presumption,
sometimes
called
a
bursting
bubble
presumption,
which
says
that
when
the
defendant
raises
this
defense,
it
requires
the
plaintiff
to
come
forward
with
the
burden
of
production
of
an
excuse
or
a
rationale
for
the
delay,
but
the
burden
of
persuasion
always
rests
on
the
defendant
because
it
is
an
affirmative
defense.
and
the
akerman
decision
is
very
clear
on
this
and
to
the
extent
the
ninth
circuit
spoke
of
presumptions,
that's
exactly
what
it
meant,
because
in
no
place
was
an
evidentiary
presumption
applied
against
her
and,
in
fact,
of
course,
this
was
a
summary
judgment
case
and
the
evidence
was
undisputed.
the
record
was
irrefutable
as
to
the
prejudice.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
i
think
it's
--
there's
a
common
sense
concept
that
if
you
are
within
--
if
the
claim
were
brought
within
the
initial
three-year
period,
after
the
claim
first
accrued
in
1991,
you
might
say
colloquially
that
there's
a
presumption
that
laches
doesn't
apply.
in
fact,
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
in
the
chirco
case.
once
you
move
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
initial
act
that
starts
the
clock
for
latches
purposes,
which
my
not
be
the
same
event,
is
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes.
it's
another
one
of
the
disconnects
between
these
two
doctrines.
the
farther
one
gets
away.
it
is
a
reality
of
the
world,
as
the
government
notes
in
its
brief,
that
the
evidentiary
prejudice
is
likely
to
increase
because
documents
get
destroyed,
witnesses
lose
their
memory,
and
so
forth.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
and
to
be
clear,
the
district
court
didn't
apply
any
such
presumption
and
didn't
put
any
such
burden
on
ms.
petrella,
so
the
language
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
irrelevant
to
when
a
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
and
certainly
irrelevant
to
the
district's
court
conclusion,
which
is
reviewed,
of
course,
for
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
you
know,
on
the
merits
of
the
applicability
of
the
latches
doctrine.
all
of
which,
by
the
way,
the
petitioner
never
raised
in
the
district
court,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
cert
petition
--
you
know,
the
presumption
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
the
government
has
brought
it
up
that
it
was
not
--
you
know,
it's
not
properly
preserved.
we're
not
afraid
of
it.
this
case
came
here
on
a
very
simple
legal
question,
a
binary
question,
is
laches
available?
the
court
should
answer
that
question
‶
yes
″.
the
details
of
this
particular
case
has
been
reviewed
by
two
courts
on
an
undisputed
record
and
we
think
they
got
it
right.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
ginsburg,
that's
why
congress
put
in
the
statutory
damages
and
also
an
attorneys'
fee
provision,
so
even
if
there
are
no
profits,
and
many
works
of
authorship
never
become
profitable,
there
is
an
incentive,
an
economic
incentive
for
the
rights
asserter
to
come
forward
to
court
and
clarify
those
rights,
because
these
are
valuable
assets.
even
money-losing
films,
books,
songs
and
so
forth
are
traded,
are
financed,
are
bought
and
sold,
either
individually
or
as
part
of
companies.
and
the
entire
economic
system
benefits
from
greater
clarity
and
earlier
resolution
of
rights.
and
i
should
point
out
in
this
respect
my
clients,
the
studios
generally,
own
many,
many
copyrights.
we
are
on
both
sides
of
the
‶
v.
″
this
is
not
a
plaintiff
versus
defendant--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--yes.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
breyer,
thank
you.
and
i
entirely
agree.
there
is
a
distinction--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--
in
this
case
between
the
availability
of
laches
and
the
applicability
of
laches.
our
position
is
that
laches
is
an
available
defense
in
every
civil
action.
that's
what
rule
8(c)
says.
rule
8(c)
has
a
list
of
affirmative
defenses.
it
is
in
there.
it
may
not
be
a
good
defense--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
latter,
your
honor,
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
law
and
equity
act
of
1915
authorized
the
courts
to
do
that.
second,
the
rules
enabling
act
of
1934
authorized
the
courts
to
do
that.
and
third,
this
court's
historical
practice
of
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
with
tolling
in
the
irwin
case,
with
unclean
hands
in
the
precision
instruments
case.
with
fraud
in
the
hazel-apta
case.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i
don't
believe
unclean
hands
ever
had
been
before
precision
instruments,
your
honor.
and
certainly
it
is
the
case
that
every
other
equitable
defense
that
this
court
has
ever
looked
at
applies
in
law.
this
court
has
never
said
in
the
modern
era
that
any
of
the
traditionally
equitable
defenses,
and
there
are
eight
of
them
listed
in
rule
8,
is
not
available
in
an
action
that
would
historically
would
have
been
brought
at
law.
and,
by
the
way,
i
should
footnote
here
that
this
is
an
action
in
equity.
had
she
brought
this
action
--
the
only
relief
sought
in
the
prayer
is
an
accounting
for
profits
and
an
injunction,
both
of
which
chancery
could
have
awarded.
so
that
the
claim
--
that
question
is
hypothetical
in
this
case.
this
is
an
equitable
case,
she
seeks
equitable
remedies,
they
are
subject
to
equitable
defenses.
but
as
a
philosophical
matter,
justice
scalia,
if
tolling,
laches
--
excuse
me
--
estoppel,
waiver,
abandonment,
unclean
hands,
fraud
all
apply
at
law--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--in
this
court,
your
honor,
you
would
find
the
morgan
case.
you
would
find
the
bay
area
laundry
case,
which
is
a
maba
case
that
i
believe
under
the
toll
seventh
amendment
analysis
would
be
viewed
as
legal
because
it
had
no
analogue
at
common
law,
both
of
which
recognized
that
were
you
have
a
rolling
statute
of
limitations
and
an
action
at
law,
laches
is
an
available
remedy
to
police
the
abuses.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
it
is
--
it
is
a
complementary
or
supplementary
doctrine
that
has
always
traveled
together.
it
becomes
more
apparent
and
frankly
more
useful
in
the
rolling
statute
of
limitations
context.
as
the
morgan
court
made
clear,
it
is
that
kind
of
cases
where
because
of
the
structural
feature
of
the
statute,
the
action
may
be
temporally
very
divorced
or
separated
from
the
events
that
are
being
disputed
that
laches
may
have
its
role
to
play.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
sir.
so
in
the
copyright
context,
every
court
of
appeals
to
have
considered
the
question
has
applied
it
to
copyright
cases,
including
legal
claims,
except
the
fourth
circuit,
although
the
fourth
circuit
has
a
subsequent
trademark
case
that
calls
that,
we
believe,
in
question.
outside
of
the
copyright
context,
in
the
patent
context,
the
federal
circuit
in
the
ackerman
case
i
cited
clearly
applies
it.
and
in
other
contexts,
there
are
some,
it
doesn't
come
up
all
that
often.
we
cited
several
cases,
the
teamsters
case
and
the
maxim
case
from
the
seventh
circuit,
which
has
the
most
developed
jurisprudence,
both
of
which
in
very
detailed
analyses
by
judge
posner,
which
addressed
all
of
the
circuit
court
authorities
pretty
much,
conclude
that
laches
applies
to
actions
in
equity
as
well
as
actions
at
law
if
that
old
distinction
makes
sense.
and,
again,
i
would
point
the
court
back
as
well
to
the
gulf
stream
case,
where
this
court,
the
last
time
it
looked
at
the
law
and
equity
act
of
1915,
determined
that
for
purposes
of
establishing
appellate
jurisdiction,
the
old
law-equity
divide
was,
quote,
‶
infelicitous
″
and
not
necessary
any
more
because
of
the
merger
and
that
that
was
no
longer
necessary.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
so
our
rule,
the
availability
of
laches,
has
been
the
rule
since
the
19th
century.
this
court
recognized
laches
in
the
callahan
case,
in
a
copyright
case,
and
it
has
been
applied
in
every
circuit
except
the
fourth,
which
doesn't
get
very
many
copyright
cases.
90
plus
percent
of
all
copyright
cases,
your
honor,
are
filed
in
the
second
circuit
or
the
ninth
circuit.
both
of
those--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
sotomayor,
we
agree
it's
an
exceptional
circumstance.
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
breyer's
question--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--sure.
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
new
era
case
applied
to
laches
to
bar
an
injunction
against
a
scientologist--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--i
don't
remember
actually.
certainly
the
danjaq
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
canvasses
this
question.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
and
this
court,
of
course--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
justice
kennedy,
our
rule,
the
availability
of
laches,
is
the
status
quo.
it
has
been
the
status
quo
for
more
than
a
100
years.
it
has
not
led
to
a
plethora
of
litigation.
it
has
not
led
to
a
bunch
of
frivolous
suits.
one
of
petitioner's
amici
said
that
laches
appears
in
something
like
1
percent
of
all
reported
cases
as
an
issue,
not
even
the
central
issue.
however,
if
the
court
were
to
change
the
rule,
depart
from
the
status
quo,
announce
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
that
this
equitable
doctrine
is
not
available
in
this
class
of
cases
or,
by
the
way,
petitioner's
rationale
is
not
limited
to
this
case,
it's
every
case,
then
the
studios
and
other
potential
defendants
would
have
the
economic
incentive
to
bring
declaratory
actions
or
contract
actions
or
other
preemptive
suits
to
clarify
rights.
increasing
litigation,
increasing
complexity.
it
is
absolutely
undisputed,
i
would
think,
or
indisputable
at
least,
that
the
rule
proposed
by
petitioner
would
lead
to
more
litigation.
our
rule
leads
to
less.
our
rule
is
what
has
always
has
been
the
law.
you
know,
our
rule
goes
to
this.
and,
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
could
pick
up
on
the
question
about
outcomes.
it
is
a
discretionary
doctrine,
so
some
cases
bar
injunctions.
some
cases
don't.
this
court
in
the
19th
century,
the
mineral
water
cases,
barred
the
injunctions.
the
mclean
liver
pill
case
didn't
bar
the
injunction.
that
is
because
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
doctrine
allows
flexibility
in
its
application,
but
it
has
always
been
known
and
understood,
particularly
in
the
gold
mine
cases,
and
this
is
just
like
a
gold
mine
case,
just
like
the
patterson
case,
it
barred
the
action.
it
said,
you
can't
get
damages,
and
you
can't
get
an
injunction.
that's
the
defense
we
asserted
in
this
case.
and,
again,
the
petitioner
did
not
dispute
that
in
the
district
court.
did
not
dispute
that
in
the
ninth
circuit.
did
not
dispute
that
in
the
cert
petition.
you
know,
that
issue
we
think--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that
if
laches
was
available,
it
bars
the
entire
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
let
me
answer
in
two
steps.
in
copyright
cases,
this
has
been
a
well
understood
and
available
defense
since
judge
learned
hand's
opinion
in
the
haas
case,
at
least,
and
gets
asserted
with
some
regularity
and
there's
decision
from
every
circuit,
just
about,
that
hears
these
kinds
of
cases,
so
i
think
empirically
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it
should
be
different
than
the
patent
case.
we
think
the
same
--
the
availability
should
be
there.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
to
the
extent
it
says
that
there's
a
categorical
bar
on
applying
laches
to
injunctions,
they
can't
be
right.
they
can't
be
right
after
ebay.
that
was
a
pre-ebay
decision
that
reflected
the
federal
circuit's
predilection
for
--
for
categorical
rules.
this
court
made
clear
in
ebay
that
all
equitable
doctrines
are
discretionary.
justice
kagan,
the
second
answer
to
your
question
is,
this
court
wouldn't
be
announcing
the
first
time.
this
court
has
twice
looked
at
this
very
question,
rolling
statutes
of
limitations,
in
bay
area
laundry
and
in
morgan.
and
in
both
times,
the
court
said
the
statutes
of
limitations
rolls
forward,
and
in
both
times,
it
said
the
potential
abuse
of
that
is
policed
by
the
laches
doctrine.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
you
can
--
you
can--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
it's
an
equitable
doctrine,
and
of
course
it
can
be
adjusted.
it
can
also
be
clarified,
though,
that
within
the
initial
term
of
statute
of
limitations,
it
very
rarely
will
apply.
but
there
will
be
cases.
the
patterson
case,
this
court's
decision
on
patterson
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case.
and
this
court
held
that
laches
barred
the
suit,
even
though
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
run.
the
second
circuit's
in
new
era
is
an
example
of
a
copyright
case,
where,
because
the
books
had
already
been
published
and
put
on
the
retailers'
shelves,
the
injunctive
request
that
would
have
required
the
recall
and
destruction
of
those
books
came
too
late
because
the
petitioner
had
actual
knowledge
--
the
plaintiff
had
actual
knowledge
and
could
have
sued
earlier.
or
you
can
think
of
a
strategic
situation
where
you
know
the
key
witness
is
on
death's
door,
and
you
wait
for
that
witness
to
keel
over
before
you
file
suit.
even
if
you're
within
the
statute,
that
--
you
know,
she
who
seeks
equity
must
do
equity.
and
there
will
be
situations,
justice
scalia,
where
within
that
same
period
--
it
will
be
extraordinary.
it
will
be
unusual.
but
on
a
rolling
statute,
it
will
happen
with
increasing
frequency
because
the
farther
you
get
away
from
the
events
in
question,
the
more
likely
the
prejudice
will
arise,
the
evidentiary
prejudice
and
the
expectations-based
or
reliance
prejudice,
both
of
which
were
established
on
this
record,
both
of
which
bar
this
claim,
both
of
which
were
found
by
the
district
court,
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit
for
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
not
found.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--we
--
we
think
it
bars
her
claim
against
mgm
to
renegotiate
this
contract
because
of
those
unique
sequence
of
events.
if
there
were
no
question
about
a
past
historical
act,
it
may
be
that
an
ongoing
infringement,
particularly
a
willful
infringement,
which
comes
up
often,
the
courts
have
said
that
past
stuff
isn't
going
to
be
barred,
but
future
--
or
excuse
me,
past
remedies
are
barred,
but
future
injunctions
may
not
be.
effectively,
this
court
said
that
in
mclean
and
menendez,
the
trademark
cases,
where
the
liability
for
trademark
infringement,
willful
trademark
infringement
was
clear.
here
we
have
a
finding--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--so
here's
where
film
is
different.
she
doesn't
have
any
right
in
the
film,
to
be
clear.
she
claims
a
right
in
the
screenplay,
and
she
claims
the
film
as
a
derivative
work.
the
re-release
of
the
film
on
film,
on
television,
vhs,
laserdisc,
dvd
blu-ray,
whatever
gets
them
in,
is
the
same
alleged
infringement.
there's
no
distinction
for
this
claim.
there
are
other
copyright
claims,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
does
matter
very
much,
the
format
and
so
forth.
for
this
claim,
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
it
is
just
like
the
morgan
case,
a
repeat
act
of
discrimination
by
the
same
supervisor
over
and
over
and
over
again.
and
that
is
why
in
these
circumstances--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
i
believe
if
--
if
these
studios
--
well,
first
of
all,
if
somebody
else
re-created
a
different
derivative
work,
this
case
doesn't
bar
her
at
all.
she
has
all
of
her
rights,
and
she
can
assert
them
against
the
world.
laches
is
a
personal
doctrine
against
two
litigants.
it's
like
an
estoppel.
okay.
it
is
an
estoppel.
second--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--thank
you,
your
honor.
second,
if
the
studios
--
these
studios
were
to
prepare
a
new
work,
a
remake
or
a
sequel,
we
would
not
take
the
position
that
laches
applies
there
because
it
is
a
new
work
as
opposed
to
--
and
my
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice
--
the
repeat
release
of
the
same
work.
