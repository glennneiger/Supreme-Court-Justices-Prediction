could
you
--
do
you
have
to
accept
justice
scalia's
premise
that
the
court
in
all
areas
is
deprived
of
that
right?
can
you
concentrate
on
your
--
your
arguments
why
in
this
particular
act,
even
if
we
had
the
option,
we
shouldn't
exercise
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
see,
counselor,
this
is
my
problem.
and
--
and
i
sort
of
disagree
with
you
fundamentally,
because
i
don't
know
that
you're
entitled
to
injunctive
relief,
but
you
might
be
entitled
to
a
compulsory
license.
and
by
that,
i
mean
you
have
--
this
is
the
government's
position,
and
maybe
i'm
arguing
for
it.
the
government
says
you
might
be
entitled
to
payment
for
the
use
of
your
copyright
because
it
belongs
to
you
and
there
shouldn't
be
some
adverse
possession
right
that
the
other
side
gets.
but
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief,
given
their
reliance
on
your
failure
to
act
for
18
years,
they
shouldn't
be
put
out
of
business
and
told
that
they
can't
continue
in
their
business.
and
so
that's
the
kind
of
policy
i'm
talking
about,
which
is
break
down
the
remedies
and
tell
me
--
i'm
more
moved
by
the
fact
that
someone
could
take
over
your
copyright
then
i
am
by
your
injunctive
relief
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
you'd
be
entitled
to
money
for
their
infringement.
3
years
--
you
only
go
back
3
years,
but
if
they
continue
to
infringe
in
the
future,
presumably
you
can
get
an
order
giving
you
damages
for
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
language
in
holmberg,
mack,
and
russell?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
you're
after
--
i've
looked
at
that,
not
myself,
but
my
law
clerk,
looked
at
all
of
the
cases
and
they
are
absolutely
right
that
in
every
case
we've
applied
laches,
it's
only
where
there's
not
been
an
underlying
statute
of
limitations.
and
in
every
case
in
which
there's
an
underlying
statute
of
limitations,
we
have
said
no
laches.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
lost
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
didn't
apply
laches
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
facts
didn't
support
that,
meaning
that
they
didn't
grant
such.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
is
true,
however,
that
your
--
while
your
--
all
of
your
investment
in
this
is
going
to
be
offset
against
your
profits,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
so
bad
about
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
should
you
--
you've
gotten
a
lot
of
profits
in
those
18
years
and,
in
fact,
at
one
point
when
she
did
reach
out
to
you,
you
told
her,
"why
sue?
"
"you're
not
going
to
get
any
money.
"
"we're
not
making
any.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
it
has
not,
then
we're
back
to
the
point
i
made.
are
you
disagreeing
with
the
government's
position
that
the
court
has
equitable
power
in
injunctive
relief
to
decide
how
much
you
paid
forward?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand.
why
didn't
you
just
go
in
and
get
a
declaratory
judgment
when
you
first
heard
from
her?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
she
was
going
to
get
this
copyright
when
her
father
died.
under
no
circumstance,
even
if
she
had
sued
in
'92,
could
she
have
brought
a
claim
in
the
1960s.
she
didn't
have
a
copyright
then.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
complaint
is
not
against
the
witness
dying.
your
complaint
is
about
what
congress
does,
which
is
to
give
a
person
the
right
to
keep
a
copyright
or
renew
it
when
the
individual
with
whom
you
probably
dealt
with
is
dead.
that's
always
going
to
be
the
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
true
about
the
ninth
circuit,
but
between
the
second,
sixth,
tenth
and
eleventh,
i
always
--
i
thought
those
circuits
announced
laches
are
available,
but
only
in
an
exceptional
circumstance.
and
i
actually
don't
know
how
many
cases
they
barred
suit,
copyright
suit
on,
completely
on
the
basis
of
laches.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
answer.
did
you
find
any
case
where
they
actually
applied
laches?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
an
injunction
but
not
the
suit
completely?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
ninth
circuit
i
know--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
about
your
creation
of
another
derivative
work?
