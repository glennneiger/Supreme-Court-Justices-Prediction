justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
you
said
both
are
subject
to
equitable
consideration.
we're
told
by
the
petitioner
that
the
equitable
rule
of
laches
simply
can't
apply.
i
was
going
to
ask:
estoppel
applies;
why
isn't
laches
just
a
first
cousin
of
estoppel.
estoppel
is
an
affirmative
misrepresentation.
why
isn't
laches
here
almost
a
misrepresentation?
and
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
laches
and
estoppel
in
this
respect.
estoppel
was
an
equitable
remedy
that's
been
taken
into
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
sitting
on
your
rights
amounted
really
to
an
affirmative
representation.
it
seems
to
me
very
close,
close
enough
so
that
i'm
not
sure
that
we
should
distinguish
between
laches
and
estoppel
as
being
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
former
is
unavailable
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
in
response
to
justice
alito's
second
part
of
his
question
about
the
other
cases?
you
talked
about
the
two
supreme
court
cases.
you
said
if
you
read
every
federal
decision,
since
the
beginning
of
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--assume
--
assume
we
have
an
interest,
just
assume
we
do,
in
not
having
too
many
suits
simply
to
protect
your
rights
in
cases
where
the
copyright
may
not
be
worth
much
or
may
not
be
well
established.
which
rule,
yours
or
the
petitioner's,
is
more
helpful
in
this
regard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
finish
answering
my
question?
