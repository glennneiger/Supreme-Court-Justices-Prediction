mr.
bibas,
i
would
have
thought
that
there
was
something
in
the
copyright
context
that
cuts
against
you,
and
that's
that
because
of
this
separate
accrual
rule
and
the
feature
of
these
roll-in
statutes
of
limitations
combined
with
very,
very
lengthy
copyrights
terms,
that
essentially
a
plaintiff
can
not
bring
suit
for
years,
decades
and
time
the
suit
in
order
to
maximize
her
own
gain.
that
strikes
me
as
something
that
we
don't
usually
see
in
statute
of
limitations
cases.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
very
many
cases
where
courts
have
applied
laches
as
against
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
that's
because
you
can't
think
of
many
instances
in
which
it
would
be
considered
unfair
to
take
the
entire
statute
of
limitations
to
bring
a
suit.
but
in
this
context,
you
look
at
something
that
seems
very
different.
a
plaintiff
can
wait
20
years
given
the
way
the
separate
accrual
work
--
rule
works.
justice
elena
kagan
we
don't
make
that
distinction
with
respect
to
equitable
tolling.
why
would
we
make
it
here?
justice
elena
kagan
‶
bizarre
″
seems
to
me
a
little
strong,
because
i
take
it
that
mr.
bibas
is
making
a
statutory
argument
--
i
mean,
he's
saying
not
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
he's
saying
what
was
congress
thinking
at
the
time.
congress
was
faced
with
all
of
these
precedents,
essentially
saying
laches
was
not
available.
there
are
no
cases
out
there
really
where
laches
does
cut
into
a
defined
statute
of
limitations
period.
and
then
you
have
the
feature
that
if
congress
knew
that
it
was
enacting
these
rolling
statutes
of
limitations,
you
would
have
thought
that
it
might
have
been
foremost
in
their
head,
how
are
we
going
to
prevent
somebody
from
suing
30
years
later.
and
they
did
nothing
of
the
kind.
they
could
very
easily
have
made
it
clear
that
laches
applied
or
they
could
have
set
an
outer
limit
or
they
could
have
done
a
number
of
things,
and
they
really
didn't
do
any
of
them.
so
how
are
we
to
account
for
all
that?
justice
elena
kagan
the
ninth
circuit
here
used
this
language
of
presumption.
it
said,
"if
any
part
of
the
alleged
wrongful
conduct
occurred
outside
of
the
limitations
period,
courts
presume
that
the
plaintiff's
claims
are
barred
by
laches.
"
and
you
just
said
laches
is,
at
least
in
part,
a
prejudice
doctrine.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
concede
that
that
presumption
is
wrong?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
one
--
you
know,
one
understanding
of
the
opinion
is,
look,
that's
just
nothing.
do
you
agree
with
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
partly
that
suggests
a
burden
of
persuasion,
but
partly
it
suggests
just
a
kind
of
starting
position
is
that
if
there
was
conduct
outside
the
limitations
period
it
was
prejudicial.
and
i
guess
i
want
to
know
why
that
would
be.
justice
elena
kagan
one
can
agree
with
that
and
not
think
that
if
conduct
happened
three
years
and
two
days
earlier
that
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
the
necessity
to
give
a
reason
flips
to
the
other
side.
justice
elena
kagan
is
your
argument
limited
to
that?
would
you
say
laches
is
also
available
when
there's
no
continuing
violation
or
when
there's
no
rolling
period?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
perry,
what
troubles
me
a
bit
about
your
argument
is
i
think
the
dearth
of
cases
on
this
is
probably
explainable
by
the
fact
that
people
just
haven't
thought
that
they
had
a
laches
defense
when
a
plaintiff
brought
a
suit
within
a
statute
of
limitations
period.
and
now,
if
we
open
this
all
up,
grant
it
in
a
statutory
context
in
which
it
makes
some
sense
to
give
people
a
laches
defense,
if
we
open
this
all
up,
we'll
be
seeing
motions
that
nobody
ever
dreamed
of
before.
