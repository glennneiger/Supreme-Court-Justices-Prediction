should
we
see
anything
in
the
particular
way
this
provision
is
worded?
it
says:
"no
civil
action
shall
be
maintained
under
the
provisions
of
this
title
unless
it
is
commenced
within
3
years
after
the
claim
accrued.
"
it
doesn't
say
"any
civil
action
may
be
maintained
if
it
is
commenced
within
3
years
after
the
claim
occurred.
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
doesn't.
you
know,
it
says
--
it
says
you
can't
do
it
unless
it's
within
three
years.
but
it
doesn't
say
that
if
it's
within
three
years,
your
home-free.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
search
every
federal
--
every
reported
federal
decision
since
1938,
how
many
would
we
find
in
which
the
court
recognized
the
available
laches
as
a
defense
to
a
claim
for
legal
relief?
