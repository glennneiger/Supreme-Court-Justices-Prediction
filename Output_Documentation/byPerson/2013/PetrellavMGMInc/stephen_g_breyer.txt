justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
by
the
way
--
i
mean,
i
guess
the
ones
that
increase
the
statute
of
limitations,
do
they
apply
too?
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
just
take
exactly
your
words,
and
i
fill
in,
instead
of
‶
tolling
″,
‶
laches
″.
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
all
right.
but
i
mean
now
what
you're
talking
about
is
custom.
you're
not
talking
about
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the
language
sounds
to
me
like
the
same.
and
so
then
i'm
obviously
going
to
ask
you
if
the
court
--
courthouse
burns
down
or
fraudulent
concealment
or
--
you
know,
there
are
dozens
of
--
not
dozens,
but
there
are
quite
a
few
such
doctrines.
and
why
would
we
apply
those
and
not
apply
the
shortening
ones
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
surprising,
because
to
show
laches,
you
have
to
show
unreasonable
delay
plus
reliance.
so
normally,
it
won't
be
unreasonable
within
a
limitation
period,
but
this
is
a
unique
statute.
the
uniqueness
is
not
in
the
words,
but
in
the
facts.
and
therefore,
the
uniqueness
is
that
it's
rolling.
and
as
long
as
you
have
a
movie
that's
going
to
make
money
over
30
years,
in
year
33,
they
bring
an
action
against
something
that
didn't
happen
till
year
30.
so
when
the
government
comes
in
and
says,
oh,
we'll
just
allow
it
as
a
defense,
you
know,
to
law
but
not
to
injunction,
law
here
has
the
same
effect
as
an
injunction.
if
you
just
leave
it
up
to
the
legal
part,
they
can
bring
whenever
they
want
as
long
as
the
movie
is
still
making
money.
and,
therefore,
it
has
exactly
the
same
effect
to
let
them
--
they
say,
oh,
you
can't
recover
--
i
mean,
you
can
recover
under
law,
you
just
can't
have
an
injunction.
who
in
their
right
mind
would
go
ahead
and
make
this
year
after
year
if
a
huge
amount
of
money
is
going
to
be
paid
to
this
copyright
owner
who
delayed
for
30
years
and
didn't
even
seem
to
own
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
the
words.
my
specific
question
is:
in
the
copyright
area,
as
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--once
you
have
given
them
the
right
to
apply
laches
to
an
injunction,
you
have
given
them
precisely
nothing,
because
exactly
the
same
thing
will
happen
to
them
once
you
bring
15
legal
actions,
as
if
you
gave
them
the
injunction.
and
if
there
is
a
difference
there,
i
haven't
been
able
to
think
of
it
yet.
so
--
so
i
don't
really
understand
the
government's
position
in
terms
of
the
practice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
comes
to
the
same
thing.
you're
giving
me
legal
arguments.
you
may
be
right
in
that.
i'll
look
into
that.
but
i'm
saying
in
practice,
no
one
in
his
right
mind
could
go
and
continue
to
produce
this
movie
when
every
penny
is
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
copyright
owner.
not
every
penny
that
they
spent,
but
every
penny
of
profit.
and
--
and
who's
going
to
do
it?
because
every
three
years
they
face
a
lawsuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
in
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
gave,
your
position
--
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
is
of
course
the
defense
laches
in
principle
applies,
but
the
defendant
will
lose
because
the
plaintiff
did
not
wait
an
unreasonably
long
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
waited
a
reasonably
long
time,
for
the
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
gave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
might
agree.
[laughter]
