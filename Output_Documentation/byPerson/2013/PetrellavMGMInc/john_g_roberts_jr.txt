does
the
laches
defense
bar
everything
in
the
future?
it
is,
after
all,
a
rolling
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
the
extent
your
concern
is
reliance,
okay,
wait
until
the
reliance
is,
you
know,
off
--
off
the
table.
then
you've
got
three
years
to
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
just
injunctions.
i
mean,
let's
say
they
--
you
know,
they
released
the
blu-ray
version
or
whatever,
and
so
in
a
particular
two-year
period,
you
make
a
lot
of
money,
and
the
suit
should
have
been
brought
before
that.
well,
starting
when
the
sales
go
down,
you
still
have
a
three-year
period
where
you're
making
the
routine
amount.

justice
john
g.
roberts,

justice
john

you,
counsel.

submitted.
