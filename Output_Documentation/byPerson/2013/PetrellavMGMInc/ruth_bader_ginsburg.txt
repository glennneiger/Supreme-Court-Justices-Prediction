justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
damages
as
well
as
injunctive
relief?
i
thought
your
brief
said
injunctive
relief
but
not
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
saharsky,
this
--
before
you
sit
down,
there's
one
puzzle
i'd
like
you
to
address
for
us,
and
that
is
your
position
is
damages
within
the
3
years,
okay.
injunction,
you
can
adjust
for
the
laches.
in
the
patent
area,
also
intellectual
property,
the
federal
circuit
has
said
that
laches
may
bar
as
it
goes
--
just
the
reverse,
laches
may
bar
monetary
relief,
but
not
injunctive
relief.
what
explains
the
difference
between,
in
the
patent
area,
no
monetary
relief,
but
yes,
injunctive
relief,
and
your
position
in
the
copyright
area,
monetary
relief
but
no
injunction
or
a
modified
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
perry,
you
said
that
the
objective
is
to
get
the
copyright
holder
to
sue
early
on
and
not
to
wait,
but
if
no
profits
had
been
made
in
that
early
period
and
it
would
cost
the
plaintiff
more
to
mount
a
lawsuit
then
the
plaintiff
could
possibly
receive
in
damages,
why
should
the
plaintiff,
who
has
a
copyright
that's
going
to
run
a
long,
long
time
sue?
if
things
stay
the
same,
no
suit
will
ever
be
brought.
why
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
plaintiff
to
see
if
the
copyright
is
worth
anything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
it
be
different
from
the
patent
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
think
the
federal
circuit's
decisions
are
wrong?
