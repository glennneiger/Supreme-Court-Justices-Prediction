justice
antonin
scalia
let's
--
let's
take
your
second
point.
what
a
statute
of
limitations
says
is
not
that
you
are
--
are
scot-free
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period.
it
simply
is
a
negative.
it
says
you
can't
be
sued
beyond
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
seems
to
me
there
is
nothing
--
if
--
if
we
adopted
the
position
of
the
other
side,
there's
nothing
that
would
cause
the
statute
of
limitations
to
be
frustrated.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
continued
to
be
used
in
equity,
even
when
there
were
limitations
period,
didn't
it.
it
may
have
started
that
way,
but
that
was
certainly
not
its
only
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
federal
law.
federal
law
adopted
it.
it
was
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
originated
in
equity,
just
as
laches
did.
the
tolling
rules
originated
in
equity.
they
were
brought
into
law.
what
troubles
me
about
this
case
is
this:
did
the
adoption
of
the
new
rules
of
federal
procedure
disable
courts
from
bringing
over
anything
else
from
equity
into
law?
tolling
used
to
exist.
it
was
brought
over
into
law
before
the
new
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
therefore,
you
would
not
be
altering
any
substantive
right
to
continue
to
apply
that
tolling
rule.
your
argument
here
is
--
is
that
to
apply
laches
is
to
alter
a
substantive
right,
and,
therefore,
under
the
--
under
the
rules
enabling
act
is
not
allowable.
my
question
is
this:
do
you
think
that
the
rules
enabling
act
prevented
courts
from
doing
what
they
had
in
the
past?
that
is,
not
using
the
act
as
the
means
of
saying
everything
that
was
in
equity
is
now
in
law,
but
rather
sitting
back
and
thinking,
you
know,
here's
another
part
of
equity
that
should
be
brought
over
into
law,
not
because
the
act
says
so,
but
because
we
think
it
ought
to
be,
just
as
we
thought
50
years
ago
the
tolling
--
the
--
the
tolling
provision
should
be
brought
over
into
law.
have
courts
been
--
been
disabled
from
doing
that
by
reason
of
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
says,
"the
rules
shall
not
alter
or
amend
any
substantive
right.
"
and
what
i'm
saying
is
it
isn't
the
rules
that
do
it.
it's
just
we
have
made
the
independent
justification
that
this
ancient
rule,
which
was
applied
in
equity,
ought
to
be
applied
in
law
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
--
the
mortgagor
does
--
does
not
invest
substantial
amounts
of
money
the
way
mgm
did
here
on
the
assumption
that
since
suit
hasn't
been
brought
for
20
years,
there's
--
there's
no
valid
claim.
i
mean,
that's
the
difference
in
that
situation.
you're
talking
about
inducing,
or
causing
at
least,
people
who
--
who
proceed
in
good
faith
on
the
assumption
that
20
years
have
gone
by.
nobody
--
nobody
has
questioned
our
doing
it.
they
invest
substantial
amounts
of
money,
and
then
when
that
money
starts
to
pay
off,
you
file
suit
and
--
and
you
get
3
years'
worth
of
--
of
their
profits.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
we
change
our
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
none
of
the
other
instances
in
which
we
brought
into
law
equitable
doctrines,
none
of
those
were
applied
with
respect
to
a
prior
enacted
federal
statute?
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
have
to
look
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
a
long
history
that
tolling
didn't
apply
of
law,
and
then
we
changed
our
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
we
--
we
never
changed
our
mind
where
there
was
a
statute
of
--
federal
statute
of
limitations?
i
--
i
don't
believe
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that
equitable
remedy
overrule
the
statement
that
you're
entitled
to
sue
for
all
the
profits
within
that
3-year
period?
you're
saying
the
injunction
can
in
effect
say
you
don't
have
to
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
does
the
second
eliminate
the
first?
if
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
first,
justice
breyer's
point
is
absolutely
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
congress
cited
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
just
mean,
you
know,
where
it
is
a
defense,
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
has
to
be
treated
the
way
rule
8(c)
says.
i
don't
think
that
rule
8(c)
establishes
that
it
applies
in
law
as
well
as
in
equity,
and
that's
the
question
i
want
to
ask
you.
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
laches
was
a
defense
available
at
law
before
the
federal
rules
were
enacted?
or
do
you
say
that
courts
continue
to
have
the
power
to
bring
it
from
equity
into
law
after
the
rules
were
enacted?
and
if
the
latter,
why
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
been
used
in
law
before,
before
the
rules--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
not
dispute
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
said
--
i
think
you've
said
that
--
that
it
would
apply
to
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
so
if
you
have
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
and
you
don't
sue
until
five
years
after,
you're
subject
to
the
defense,
well,
you
should
have
--
should
have
sued
sooner.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
share
justice
kagan's
reservation
about
that.
could
we
limit
our
opinion
just
to
rolling
statutes?
