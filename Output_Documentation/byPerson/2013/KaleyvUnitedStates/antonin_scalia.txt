justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
--
you
know,
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
think
that
--
that
the
right
of
property
is
any
more
sacrosanct
than
the
--
the
right
to
freedom
of
the
person.
and
we
allow
a
grand
jury
indictment
without
--
without
a
separate
mini-trial
to
justify
the
arrest
and
--
and
holding
of
--
of
the
individual.
and
if
he
--
if
he
doesn't
have
bail,
he's
permanently
in
jail
until
the
trial
is
over.
and
we
allow
all
of
that
just
on
the
basis
of
a
grand
jury
indictment.
and
you're
telling
us
it's
okay
for
that
--
maybe
you
think
it's
not
okay
for
that.
but
i
think
you're
saying
it's
okay
for
that,
but
it's
not
okay
for
distraining
his
property.
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
--
to
think
that
it's
okay
for
the
one
and
not
okay
for
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
okay.
this
is
a
bigger
case
than
i
thought.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
only
in
the
case
where
the
person
has
no
other
assets,
where
all
of
his
assets
are
seized
so
that
he
can't
--
he
can't
hire
counsel?
suppose
only
half
of
his
assets
are
determined
to
--
or
asserted
by
the
government
to
have
been
the
product
of
criminal
activity,
and
he
has
a
lot
of
other
money
with
which
he
can
hire
an
attorney.
is
that
a
different
case?
and
we're
not
--
that's
not
before
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
a
hearing
on
whether
he
has
other
money,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
terrible.
we
shouldn't
allow
that.
we
shouldn't
even
hold
the
fellow.
we've
been
doing
it
for
a
thousand
years,
though,
and
it's
hard
to
say
that
it
violates
what
our
concept
of
fundamental
fairness
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
grand
jury
indictment
doesn't
--
doesn't
establish
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
a
flight
risk.
that
doesn't
contradict
what
the
grand
jury
found.
you're
asking
the
judge
here
to
contradict
what
the
grand
jury
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
the
next
case
we
have,
if
we
agree
with
you,
will
be
somebody
saying
due
process
does
not
allow
you
to
proceed
with
a
trial
when
it
has
been
found
by
an
impartial
judge
that
there
is
no
probable
cause.
that
will
be
our
next
case,
right?
and
you
may
well
argue
it.
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
would
prefer
--
to
save
your
client,
i
would
prefer
a
rule
that
says
you
cannot,
even
with
a
grand
jury
indictment,
prevent
the
defendant
from
using
funds
that
are
in
his
possession
to
hire
counsel.
don't
need
a
hearing.
just,
just
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
rule
to
be
any
broader
than
withholding
money
that
the
defendant
does
not
need
to
defend
himself.
would
you
like
that?
i
really
prefer
it
to
yours.
i
think
yours
leads
us
into
really
strange
territory.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
hearing
include
an
assessment
of
the
reasonableness
of
attorneys'
fees?
i
mean,
if
you're
only
withholding
the
amount
of
money
necessary
for
the
defense,
what
if
this
fellow
wants
to
hire
clarence
darrow?
does
--
does
that
give
him
all
the
money?
how
--
how
do
you
decide
that
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
he
know
his
lawyer
--
is
his
lawyer
there
saying,
you
know,
this
is
the
lawyer
i'm
going
to
hire
and
here's
the
fee
i'm
going
to
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you
acknowledge
that
that
could
be
--
that
could
be
an
issue
in
the
hearing
in
other
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
the
fees
are.
i
don't
even
know
who
the
lawyer's
going
to
be.
this
defendant
just
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
to
hire
a
lawyer.
and
the
court
says,
you
know,
any
particular
lawyer?
no,
i
just
want
a
lawyer.
the
court's
going
to
have
to
make
up
a
fee,
i
assume,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
he
has
to
choose
a
lawyer
before
this
hearing,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
something,
because
i
don't
know
the
answer.
can
--
can
the
government
track
tainted
funds
that
--
that
have
been
given
to
other
people,
including
lawyers?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
can
too.
so
what
happens
if
this
lawyer
gets
his
$500,000
and
you've
had
the
traceability
hearings,
so
these
are
tainted
funds?
if
he
is
convicted,
he
gives
the
money
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
do
we
have
to
decide
it
that
way?
i
mean,
i
don't
like
casting
into
doubt
the
judgment
of
the
grand
jury,
but
why
couldn't
we
say
that
when
you're
taking
away
funds
that
are
needed
for
hiring
a
lawyer
for
your
defense,
you
need
something
more
than
probable
cause?
couldn't
we
make
that
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
say
due
process
requires
something
more
than
probable
cause?
