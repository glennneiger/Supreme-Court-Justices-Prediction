chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-464,
kaley
vs.
united
states.
mr.
srebnick?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
might
have
been
that,
yes,
in
fact,
the
property
is
entitled
to
greater
protection
because
it's
going
to
be
used
to
hire
counsel
that
will
keep
the
person
out
of
jail
long
term,
even
if
he
can
be
put
in
jail
pending
the
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
if
the
government
knows
it's
got
to
go
through
a
hearing
where
it
has
to
lay
out
part
of
its
case,
it
may
well
decide
at
that
point
it's
not
worth
it.
so
it's
not
24
or
25.
who
knows
how
many
hundreds
of
times
the
government
would
have
sought
to
seize
the
assets
but
didn't
because
they
knew
they
would
have
to
justify
it
at
a
hearing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
none
of
that
goes
to
his
ability
to
hire
his
counsel
of
choice.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
to
make
this
case
quite
different.
it's
not
that
property
is
more
valuable
than
liberty
or
anything
like
that.
it's
that
the
property
can
be
used
to
hire
a
lawyer
who
can
keep
him
out
of
jail
for
the
next
30
years.
so
the
parallels
don't
strike
me
as
useful.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
the
theory.
in
reality
it's
not
terribly
--
it's
not
great
insulation
from
the
overweaning
power
of
the
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
what
this
case,
frankly,
has
to
do
with
the
grand
jury
at
all,
or
review
of
the
grand
jury
determination.
you
don't
have
to
put
forward
in
this
hearing
what
you
put
forward
before
the
grand
jury
at
all.
you
could
put
forth
different
stuff.
you
could
put
forth
less
of
it.
maybe
you
don't
want
to
show
your
--
your
whole
hand.
maybe
the
party
on
the
other
side,
they
don't
want
to
show
their
whole
hand
too,
so
they
don't
want
to
show
all
this
other
evidence
that's
going
to
prove
--
prove
their
innocence.
it's
an
entirely
separate
proceeding.
now,
maybe
the
fact
of
the
grand
jury
indictment
should
be
given
some
weight
or
not.
but
it's
not
reviewing
a
particular
determination.
it's
the
judge
making
a
determination
on
what
he
or
she
has
before
him
at
that
particular
hearing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it's
not,
in
the
sense
that
before
the
grand
jury
you
say:
okay,
here,
we
showed
the
grand
jury
these
six
things
and
they
said
yes.
you
look
at
those
six
things;
there's
the
probable
cause.
at
this
other
hearing,
you
say:
i've
got
--
i'm
going
to
show
you
these
two
things,
and
the
other
side
has
these
three
things,
and
the
judge
at
that
point
says:
well,
you
don't
have
enough
to
restrain
the
property.
it's
not
reviewing
the
other
determination.
it's
an
entirely
separate
proceeding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
because
they
didn't
have
the
good
lawyers
they
wanted
to
hire.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
are
you
talking
about
cases
in
like
the
second
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
where
you
do
have
these
hearings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
raised
this
point
earlier.
it
may
be
because
the
government,
particularly
when
it
may
have
tenuous
probable
cause
basis,
decides
it's
not
worth
it
to
go
through
this
hearing
to
seize
and
retain
the
assets.
and
it
just
seems
that
the
statistics
are
phony
in
the
sense
that
where
the
impact
of
this
is
going
to
be
is
not
in
reported
cases;
it's
going
to
be
when
the
u.s.
attorney
says
it's
not
worth
it,
it
would
jeopardize
the
trial
on
the
merits,
and
so
they
don't
even
go
through
the
process
of
restraining
the
assets.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
more
that
the
facts,
since
the
funds
are
traceable
anyway
and
they'll
have
an
opportunity
to
get
them
at
the
end
even
if
they
don't
get
their
restraining
order,
makes
it
not
worth
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
making
it
sound
like
you
would
lose
the
whole
case.
this,
to
some
extent,
is
a
little
bit
of
a
side
show.
you
want
to
send
the
kaleys
to
jail
and
you
want
the
assets
that
you
think
are
traceable
to
it
and
that's
all
well
and
good.
but
it's
not
like
the
whole
case
falls
apart
depending
on
whether
or
not
you
can
restrain
the
assets
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
they're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--sure.
but
now
you've
touched
on
something
that
i
think
is
very
pertinent.
they
are
used
to
pay
restitution
to
the
victims.
i
mean,
the
whole
point
here,
and
presumably
it's
something
that
your
friends
on
the
other
side
would
raise
in
one
of
these
hearings
is
there
are
no
victims.
right?
that's
the
theory,
and
maybe
it
will
fall
apart
and
the
judge
will
say,
of
course,
there
are
victims,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
hospitals,
you
know,
gave
them
to
the
people;
the
companies
didn't
want
them
back
because
they
would
have
to
give
a
credit.
you
know,
i'm
sure
the
government
has
a
different
view
of
the
facts,
but
that's
a
good
example.
okay,
this
is
going
to
be
used
to
pay
restitution
to
the
victims.
they
come
in
and
say,
well,
just
give
me
five
minutes,
your
honor,
you'll
see
there
are
no
victims.
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
srebnick,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
your
quotation
from
the
d.c.
circuit
was
--
was
not
quite
on
point.
my
understanding
is
the
court
was
asking
for
empirical
evidence
that
this
has
caused
a
particular
problem,
not
whether
they
could
point
to
any
concerns.
i
think
we've
seen
the
concerns
laid
out
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
