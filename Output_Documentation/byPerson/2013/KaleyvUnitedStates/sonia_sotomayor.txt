justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see
the
government's
strongest
argument
as
being
that
the
grand
jury
finding
of
probable
cause
is
sacrosanct,
and
a
hearing
like
the
one
that
you
are
proposing
would
call
the
validity
of
that
finding
into
question.
why
don't
you
address
that
because
we
--
you
were
talking
about
in
bail
the
validity
of
the
charges
are
not
at
issue,
just
one
factor
in
the
court's
determination
of
whether
to
restrain
him
or
her
is
the
strength
of
the
government's
case.
are
you
trying
to
draw
a
similar
analogy
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
at
least
five
who
are
ruling
similarly
to
yours.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
as
a
footnote,
one
in
a
million,
which
might
be
your
case.
i
think
that's
the
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
would,
presumably,
if
--
like
here
--
if
there's
a
legal
dispute
and
the
government
thinks
the
judge
is
wrong,
they
would
try
the
case
and
go
up
on
appeal
and
say
to
the
appellate
court
the
judge
below
was
wrong
initially.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
have
lost
the
money
in
that
case,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
to
go
that
--
i
mean,
your
adversary
just
said
that
there
was
a
judicial
finding
of
no
probable
cause.
i
don't
know
why
that
judicial
finding
has
any
legal
effect
other
than
to
release
the
money
at
issue.
the
judge
is
basically
saying,
like
he
does
in
a
bail
hearing,
this
evidence
is
not
the
strongest
i've
seen.
in
balancing
the
government's
desire
for
restraint
and
the
fundamental
right
to
hire
a
lawyer
of
choice,
it's
not
strong
enough
in
this
situation
with
what
i've
been
presented
to
continue
restraining
the
money.
i
don't
see
it
as
a
legal
determination
that
no
probable
cause.
i
see
it
as
defining
the
word
“
may
”
in
the
statute.
if
the
judge
has
discretion,
that
discretion
has
to
be
informed
by
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
often
has
that
happened
in
the
five
circuits?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
the
whole
point,
which
is
you
talk
about
compulsion
on
the
government,
but
the
compulsion
of
the
defendant
not
to
have
a
hearing
because
they
are
required
to
say
something
that
could
put
them
at
greater
risk,
whether
it's
because
of
the
enhancements
for
obstruction
of
justice
or
merely
from
losing
the
advantage
of
their
defense
at
trial,
that's
why
these
hearings
are
so
rare.
i
think
it's
less
about
the
government
not
wanting
to
disclose
its
case
and
more
about
the
inducements
against
the
defense
wanting
to
preview
its
case.
