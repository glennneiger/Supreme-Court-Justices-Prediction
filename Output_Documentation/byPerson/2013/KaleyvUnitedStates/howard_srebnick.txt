mr.
howard
srebnick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
government
restrains
private
property,
the
owner
of
that
property
has
the
right
to
be
heard
at
a
meaningful
time
and
in
a
meaningful
manner.
for
a
criminal
defendant
who's
facing
a
criminal
trial,
whose
property
has
been
restrained,
that
time
is
now,
before
the
criminal
trial,
so
that
he
or
she
can
use
those
assets,
that
property,
to
retain
and
exercise
counsel
of
choice.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
scalia,
it's
not
okay
for
either.
mr.
howard
srebnick
the
right
to
be
released
on
bail,
that
is,
the
right
not
to
be
detained
all
the
way
until
trial,
under
this
court's
precedent
in
united
states
v.
salerno,
the
court
provided
procedural
safeguards
to
ensure
that
before
someone
is
held
all
the
way
until
trial,
they
would
have
a
hearing,
a
hearing
which
would
include
a
right
to
challenge
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
other
factors.
we
ask
for
something
no
different.
indeed,
the
indictment
itself
can
justify
the
detention
of
the
body
and
the
detention
of
the
asset
until
such
time--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--every
person
is
limited
by
their
own
financial
wherewithal.
and
so
long
as
bail
is
set
not
as
an
excessive
bail,
he
or
she
must
rely
on
the
assets
that
he
or
she
owns.
mr.
howard
srebnick
in
the
context
of
a
bail
hearing,
a
judge
does
make
that
determination.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes,
we
are,
justice
ginsburg.
in
the
united
states
v.
salerno,
this
court
upheld
pretrial
detention
because
there
were
procedural
safeguards,
a
right
to
be
heard,
shortly
after
the
arrest.
in
the
context
of
the
restraint
of
assets,
as
it
stands
now
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
there
is
no
right
to
be
heard
at
any
time
until--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--mr.
chief
justice,
we've
certainly
made
that
argument
in
our
brief.
some
might
find
it
more
important
to
have
those
assets
to
retain
counsel
of
choice
than
having
their
liberty
deprived
temporarily.
in
either
case,
the
right
to
be
heard
should
include
the
right
to
be
heard
by
a
judge,
a
judge
who
would
have
the
authority
to
provide
relief.
mr.
howard
srebnick
that's
not
this
case.
so
long
as--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--such
--
such
a
hearing
took
place
in
this
case,
indeed.
but
nevertheless,
the
petitioners,
the
kaleys,
did
not
have
sufficient
other
funds
to
retain
counsel
of
choice.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
there
could
be
and
should
be.
indeed,
if
the
court
were
to
modify
the
restraining
order
to
allow
funds
to
be
paid
to
counsel,
the
court
would
supervise
the
release
of
those
funds
to
ensure
that
indeed
the
funds
were
be
using
--
were
being
used
for
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
vacation
of
the
restraining
order
so
that
the
moneys
can
be
used
for
other
purposes.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
sotomayor,
what
we
are
proposing,
and
indeed
it's
been
a
hearing
that's
taken
place
in
several
of
the
circuits
for
some
25
years
now--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--so
for
25
years
the
courts
in
those
circuits
have
been
holding
these
hearings.
and
what
these
hearings
look
like
are
similar
to
a
pretrial
detention
hearings,
they
are
similar
to
suppression
hearings,
they
are
similar
indeed
to
what
rule
5.1
preliminary
hearings
might
look
like.
and
all
these
hearings
require
is
a
presentation
by
both
sides.
each
side
makes
its
presentation.
of
course,
the
grand
jury
is
a
one-sided
presentation.
of
course,
the
grand
jury
does
not
give
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
indeed
the
grand
jury
doesn't
give
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
have
his
adversary
present
exculpatory
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
based
on
this--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
scalia,
we
are
not
quarrelling
with
the
power
of
the
grand
jury
to
initiate
the
charge.
we
are
simply
saying
the
grand
jury
doesn't
have
the
power
to
initiate
and
hold
for
the
period
between
indictment
and
trial,
the--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
so.
what's
at
issue
at
the
hearing
is
what
the
government
presents
at
that
hearing
as
compared
to
what
the
defense
presents
at
that
hearing,
no
different,
i
submit,
than
in
civil
cases
under
rule
65
where
a
judge
holds
an
interim
hearing
on
the
entry
or
nonentry
of
an
injunction,
that
doesn't
define
the
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
howard
srebnick
i
believe
the
indictment
authorizes
the
initiation
of
the
restraint
and
not
more.
the
government--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
kennedy,
if
the
defendant
makes
a
presentation
at
the
hearing--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--if
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
hearing
because
the
defendant
needs
assets
to
retain
counsel
of
choice,
and
the
government
rests
on
the
indictment
and
the
defense
presents
nothing
more,
i
submit
the
government
would
prevail
at
that
hearing
if
nothing
is--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--under
the
statute--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--under
the
bail
reform
act,
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
in
certain
offenses
where
an
indictment
has
been
returned
that
the
person
is
a
flight
risk,
but
it
is
a
rebuttal
presumption.
we
are
asking
for
the
same
opportunity
to
rebut
the
entry
of
the
restraint.
so
we
in
no
way
are
submitting
that
the
prosecution
is
prevented
from
proceeding
to
trial.
mr.
howard
srebnick
we
are
asking
the
judge
to
make
an
independent
finding
based
on
what's
presented
to
that
judge
at
the
hearing,
the
very
hearings
that
have
been
occurring
for
25
years.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
ginsburg,
what
the
judge
might
conclude
is
at
that
hearing
at
that
moment
in
time
the
government
did
not
satisfy
its
burden,
on
that
one
day
in
time.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
judge
has
gone
back
to
look
at
what
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
alito--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
alito,
what
we
are
proposing
and
what
indeed
happened
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
the
kaleys,
the
defense
presented
transcripts
of
testimony.
all
we
asked
the
judge
to
do
is
to
consider
it.
indeed,
the
judge
had
presided
over
a
trial
of
a
co-defendant
who
was
acquitted.
mr.
howard
srebnick
in
the
more
ordinary
situation
the
defense,
if
it
chose
to
offer
evidence,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
standard
for
issuing
subpoenas
under
nixon
only
if
there
were
material
exculpatory
evidence
that
needed
to
be
presented.
this
would
not
be
a
discovery
exercise.
this
would
not
be
an
effort
to
simply
learn
identity
of
witnesses.
indeed,
the
government
could
and
does
rely
upon
hearsay
witnesses,
case
agents,
to
summarize
the
case.
but
where
the
defense,
as
here,
offers
the
judge
evidence
of
innocence,
where
the
judge
himself
has
presided
over
the
trial
of
a
co-defendant
and
sees
the
defect
in
the
indictment,
sees
the
defect
in
the
theory
of
prosecution,
we
believe
due
process
does
not
allow
the
judge
to
close
his
eyes
to
that--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
was
the
issue
in
monsanto
and
caplin
&
drysdale
where
this
court
held
5
to
4
decision
that
assets
that
are
demonstrably
tainted
can
be
restrained
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
who
needs
those
assets
to
retain
counsel
of
choice.
today,
i'm
asking
the
court
not
to
allow
the
restraint
of
those
assets
that
are
demonstrably
not
tainted.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
kagan--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--actually,
i
believe
that
the
brief
of
the
new
york
council
of
defense
lawyers
that
justice
kagan
refers
to
points
out
that
there
are
many
other
cases
where
at
the
courthouse
steps
the
parties
resolve
the
question
of
the
restraint
of
those
assets.
mr.
howard
srebnick
mr.
chief
justice,
that
may
be
so,
but
it
appears
that
the
government
does
exactly
that
every
day
in
federal
court
during
pretrial
detention
hearings
when
it
proffers
its
case
in
order
to
convince
a
judge
to
detain
a
defendant
and
we're
asking
for
something
no
different.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we
distinguish
between
tainted
and
traceable
to.
the
court
below
granted
us
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
assets
restrained
were
traceable
to
the
conduct
in
the
indictment.
what
we
would
like
to
show
at
a
hearing,
indeed,
i
think
we
have
shown
it
on
the
record
before
district
court,
is
that
even
though
the
assets
that
are
under
restraint
are
traceable
to
the
conduct,
the
conduct
is
simply
not
criminal.
and
we'd
like
the
court
to
hold
a
hearing
which
would
not
bind
the
court
at
trial.
again,
no
different
than
courts
hold
in
civil
cases
with
rule
65,
this
interim
decision
is
not
a
determination
of
whether
the
grand
jury
got
it
right
or
wrong.
it's
a
determination
of
whether
the
government
presented
a
sufficient
case
on
that
day
to
satisfy
its
burden.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
alito,
not
necessarily.
it
would
depend
on
why
there
was
no
so-called
probable
cause.
if
it
was
based
on
a
--
something
known
to
the
prosecutor
that
would
constrain
him
or
her
ethically,
perhaps.
but
if
it
was
simply
because
the
prosecutor
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
only
presented
one
witness
instead
of
all
five,
that
would
not
constrain
the
prosecutor
ethically
in
any
way.
the
prosecutor
retains
the
discretion
to
decide
how
strong
a
presentation
to
make
at
this
hearing,
no
different
than
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
make
that
same
decision
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
at
a
pretrial
detention
hearing
or
plaintiffs
have
to
make
at
a
rule
65
hearing.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
alito,
again,
not
necessarily.
people
can
differ
about
credibility.
we're
not
talking
here
about
knowingly
presenting
perjured
testimony
or
anything
of
that
sort
that
might
raise
ethical
constraints.
mr.
howard
srebnick
i
believe,
yes,
justice--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
sotomayor,
forgive
me.
justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
the
government
could
have
--
and
i
haven't
studied
whether
they
would
have
a
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
that
unfreezing
of
the
assets.
i
--
i
suppose
they
would
just
like
we
did.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
decided
the
same
way
courts
every
day
decide
the
reasonableness
of
fees
and
the
legitimacy
of
fees.
so
long
as
the
money
is
being
used
for
bona
fide
legal
fees--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--in
this
case,
yes,
because
counsel
of
choice
had
been
retained
two
years
before
the
indictment.
had
been
working
on
the
case
for
two
years
when
the
indictment
was
returned
and
the
restraining
order
was
entered.
so
counsel
of
choice
had
already
estimated
fees,
disclosed
them
to
the
court,
all
a
matter
of
record.
there
was
never
a
dispute
about
the
reasonableness
of
the
fees,
the
bona
fides
of
the
fees,
the
legitimacy
of
the
fees.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes,
justice
scalia.
if
the
fees
were
a
sham,
if
the
fees
were
unreasonable,
if
they
were
not
consistent
with
the
locality,
of
course,
that
could
be--
mr.
howard
srebnick
--justice
scalia,
we're
talking
now
about
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
the
lawyer
would
have
been
chosen
by
the
defendant.
the
lawyer's
fees
would
be
disclosed
to
the
court,
and
the
court
would
then
have
information
upon
which
to
make
a
decision
about
whether
the
fees
are
reasonable
and
bona
fide.
mr.
howard
srebnick
if
the
defendant
is
seeking
a
particular
amount
to
be
unfrozen
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
of
funds,
of
course,
the
court
would
need
to
know
who
the
lawyer
was
and
how
much
the
fee
was.
and
so
there's
no
problem
with
the
court
administering
those
issues.
indeed,
the
courts
on
a
daily
basis
supervise
the
payment
of
appointed
lawyers.
and
so
all
that
the
defense
here
is
asking
for
is
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
manner,
not
simply
about
whether
the
asset
restrained
is
traceable
to
the
conduct.
this
court's
precedence
has
never
limited
due
process
to
a
tracing
inquiry
as
suggested
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
so
there
is
no
mystery
in
this
case.
who
counsel
is,
what
the
estimate
of
fees
are,
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
petitioners
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
so
as
to
challenge
this
restraining
order
that
purports
to
remain
in
effect,
indeed,
has
remained
in
effect,
for
six
years.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes.
mr.
howard
srebnick
the
estimate
was
a
fee
of
up
to
$500,000
for
two
lawyers
and
the
entire
investigation
costs,
consultants,
experts,
et
cetera.
that
was
the
budget.
there
was
no
actual
dollar
figure
set
in
stone.
it
was
a
budget
in
order
to
allow
the
defense
to
have
their
counsel
of
choice.
mr.
howard
srebnick
yes,
justice
kennedy.
and
there
was
never
a
question
by
the
district
court
or,
indeed,
by
the
government
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
that
budget
if
the
case
were
to
go
all
the
way
through
trial.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
scalia,
i
believe
they
can.
mr.
howard
srebnick
justice
scalia,
in
this
case,
if
the
hearing
would
go
forward,
the
only
way
the
lawyers
would
be
paid
is
if
there
would
be
a
finding
by
the
court
that
the
conduct
at
issue
will
not
give
rise
to
forfeiture.
and
so
the
lawyers
would,
of
course,
try
to
rely
upon
that
judicial
decision
to
establish
the
bona
fides
of
their
accepting
that
fee
in
the
event
that
the
defendants
were
convicted
and
the
government
sought
forfeiture.
the
defense
lawyers
might
be
at
risk.
mr.
howard
srebnick
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
srebnick
the
government
is
asking
for
an
extraordinary
remedy.
we're
asking
for
limited
relief.
justice
alito,
we're
asking
for
the
kind
of
hearing
that
federal
courts
do
every
day.
this
is
not
a
fishing
expedition.
this
is
not
a
discovery
exercise.
mr.
howard
srebnick
the
hearing
looks
very
similar
to
a
pretrial
detention
hearing.
and
in
2008,
in
front
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
government
was
asked
the
question
that
this
court
asks
today:
what
would
be
the
prejudice
to
the
government
or
what
has
been
the
prejudice
to
the
government
in
holding
these
hearings?
and
i
quote
from
the
d.c.
circuit:
"the
government
could
not
identify
any
harm
to
its
law
enforcement
efforts
in
the
second
circuit
that
has
resulted
from
the
monsanto
standard.
"
521
fed
3d
at
419,
footnote
1.
today,
we
hear
fears
of
lawyers
abusing
the
process.
we
have
a
record.
all
we
ask
is
the
judge
to
read
the
trial
record
that
he
presided
over
and
come
to
a
conclusion
that
will
not
bind
the
court
at
trial.
it
will
not
bind
the
government
at
trial.
mr.
howard
srebnick
i
understand
the
hypothetical
concerns
that
the
prosecution
raises.
i
understood
the
d.c.
circuit
to
say,
is
there
any
empirical
evidence?
in
matthews,
the
case
that
we
cite
and
that
we
believe
controls,
this
court
said,
"bare
statistics
rarely
provide
a
satisfactory
measure
of
fairness
of
a
decision-making
process.
"
and
so
rather
than
rely
on
statistics,
we
rely
on
the
due
process
clause,
guarantee
that
you
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
when
the
government
wants
to
freeze
the
equity
in
my
client's
home
and
say
to
her
and
say
to
her
husband
they
can't
use
the
equity
in
their
home
to
retain
counsel
of
choice
when
they've
shown
the
court
that
they
can
prevail.
the
government
says
the
judge
must
close
his
eyes.
the
judge
can't
consider
the
trial
that
he
presided
over.
instead,
he
must
be
constrained
by
a
one-sided
proceeding
that
the
judge
never
observed,
the
grand
jury.
we
say
the
grand
jury
is
enough
to
make
my
client
go
to
trial.
we'll
be
there,
if
we
have
to
be
there.
but
we
say
she
and
he
should
have
the
right
to
use
their
assets
to
retain
their
counsel
of
choice.
after
all,
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
a
structural
right.
it
is
per
se
reversible
to
deny
someone
their
counsel
of
choice.
i
ask
that
this
court
not
rule
that
the
government
can
beggar
a
defendant
into
submission.
i
ask
this
court
not
to
rule
that
the
government
--
that
the
government
can
impoverish
someone
without
giving
them
a
chance
to
be
heard
through
their
counsel
of
choice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
submit
the
case.
