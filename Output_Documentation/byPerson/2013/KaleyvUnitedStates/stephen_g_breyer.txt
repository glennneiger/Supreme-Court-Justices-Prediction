justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
do
that,
fine,
done.
what
we
interpret
the
statute
as
saying
under
constitutional
compulsion,
it
uses
the
word
“
may
”,
and
if
the
magistrate
concludes
that
there
is
--
after
all,
the
basic
principle
of
hearings
is
you
don't
need
a
hearing
where
there's
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about.
so
unless
the
defendant
demonstrates
that
there
is
a
sound
reason
to
believe
that
the
grand
jury
was
wrong,
they
only
heard
one
side
of
the
story,
and
that
there
is
no
probable
cause,
you
don't
have
to
give
him
a
hearing.
but
the
word
is
“
may
”.
and
so,
like
five
circuits,
mr.
magistrate,
if
you
think
that
there
is
a
good
chance
--
phrase
that
as
you
want
--
that
they
can
show
that
the
grand
jury
was
wrong
and
they
want
the
money
to
pay
a
lawyer
--
by
the
way,
without
a
good
lawyer,
they're
never
going
to
make
their
case
--
and
then
under
those
circumstances,
the
magistrate
may.
now,
that's
a
narrow
exception.
it
preserves
the
lawyer.
it's
consistent
with
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
respects
the
grand
jury,
at
least
to
the
same
extent
that
bail
hearings
--
and
when
you
have
--
oh,
yes,
and
probably
i
could
think
of
a
few
others
or
something.
but
the
--
it's
not
undercutting
the
grand
jury.
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
leaves
open
--
it
leaves
open
the
question
in
monsanto
explicitly.
and
the
only
change
that
i've
made
with
that
explicit
leaving
open
the
due
process
question
in
the
footnote
in
monsanto
is,
instead
of
turning
it
on
the
constitution,
i
turned
it
on
the
principle
of
constitutional
avoidance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
“
never
”
is
consistently,
and
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
footnote.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
actually.
what
it
says
is,
we
reject
the
discretion
in
the
context
of
judge
widener
having
said
that
even
where
there
is
probable
cause,
we
are
going
to
balance
a
lot
of
factors,
and
what
it
says
at
the
--
wait,
i
had
it
a
second
ago.
i'll
find
it
again.
it
says
at
the
top
of
the
next
page,
it
says
that
the
“
may
”
thing
refers
to
that.
i'll
get
it
for
you
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
it
is.
it
says,
"thus,
it's
plainly
aimed
at
implementing
the
commands
at
853(a)
and
cannot
sensibly
be
construed
to
give
the
district
court
discretion
to
permit
the
dissipation
of
the
very
property
that
853(a)
requires
to
be
forfeited
upon
conviction.
"
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
that's
what
it
says.
so
the
claim
here
is
this
is
property
that
850(a)(3)(a)
does
not
require
the
defendant
to
forfeit
upon
conviction,
for
there
can
be
no
conviction
because
there
is
no
evidence
and,
therefore,
i
don't
find
that
that
sentence
in
monsanto
destroys
the
use
of
the
word
which
congress
put
in,
“
may
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
far
this
is
very
conceptual,
which
is
absolutely
fine.
i
just
want
to
leave
that
plain
for
a
moment,
and
if
i
leave
the
conceptual
plain,
what
i
find
is
that
they
have
a
pretty
complicated
case.
they
are
saying
that
this,
the
defendant,
took
some
medical
devices
with
permission
from
hospitals
that
were
old
and
used,
and
he
didn't
return
them
to
the
manufacturer,
who
didn't
want
them.
and
what
he
did
is
he
figured
out
this
way
of
selling
them
and
making
money.
now,
they
are
saying
that's
not
that
and
you're
saying
it
is
that,
and
so
to
make
the
arguments
is
complicated.
you
can't
do
it
without
a
good
lawyer.
he
has
some
money
here
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
you
say,
oh,
but
it
will
undercut
the
grand
jury.
you
say,
this
has
been
the
law
in
five
circuits
and
the
government
has
not
come
to
the
end
of
its
prosecutions,
it
hasn't
injured
prosecutions.
so
as
a
purely
practical
matter,
first
amendment,
no
real
harm
to
the
government
that
i
can
see.
and
so
let's
impose
some
kind
of
statutory
limitation
on
use
of
this,
but
where
there
is
a
good
claim
for
it,
let
it
be
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
that
happened
in
the
circuits
that
have
permitted
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i
think
in
the
circuit,
you've
now
given
us
some
statistics.
so
in
how
many
cases
in
the
circuits
that
have
permitted
what
they
want
or
my
version
of
it,
the
circuits
that
have
permitted
some
form
of
allowing
the
magistrate
to
look
behind
the
grand
jury
indictment
in
appropriate
cases
and
find
that
it's
there,
there
is
no
probable
cause,
so
you
can
use
this
to
hire
a
lawyer.
there
are
a
bunch
of
circuits
that
have
had
rules
like
that.
in
how
many
cases
in
those
circuits
has
the
government
faced
the
serious
risks
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
give
me
a
guess?
you
are
--
i
mean,
you
make
a
huge
point
of
how
this
will
put
the
government
at
a
disadvantage,
so
someone
in
your
office,
probably
you,
asked
people
in
the
justice
department,
do
you
have
any
examples?
or
how
many
cases
have
there
been
where
these
serious
problems
arose?
and
you
probably
got
some
kind
of
answer.
so
you
probably
have
some
kind
of
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
anecdotes?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
a
number
of
cases,
several
specific.
is
that
more
like
four
or
is
it
more
like
24?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
related
question,
since
it
came
up.
i
was
curious
as
to
how
much
of
this
forfeiture
money
gets
to
victims.
so
the
best
we
could
do
is
looking
up
three
years
and
on
the
basis
of
the
figures
that
i
got
out
of
the
doj
on
that,
about
25,
20
to
25
percent
goes
to
a
category
called
third-party
interest.
now,
the
third-party
interest
includes
mortgagees,
it
includes
other
creditors,
it
includes
states,
who
want
taxes,
etcetera.
and
if
you
subtract
all
those,
a
rough
guess
would
be
5
or
10
percent
goes
to
victims.
now
do
you
have
a
better
estimate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
what
the
--
if
you
look
at
the
actual
amount
in
general.
but
the
interests
at
issue
here
are:
one,
this
money
goes
to
pay
for
a
lawyer
so
the
person
can
prove
that
there
is
not
even
a
claim
against
him;
and
the
risks,
of
course,
sometimes
of
depriving
the
recipients
of
the
forfeiture
moneys
and
those
would
normally
be,
almost
entirely,
the
doj
for
the
expenses
of
going
to
the
forfeiture
expense
of
the
trial.
it
would
--
various
criminal
justice
organizations
on
the
prosecution
side,
states,
who
want
taxes.
very
little
is
being
deprived
of
victims.
is
that
a
fair
comment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
could
deal
with
that,
couldn't
we,
by
imposing
conditions
surrounding
the
use
of
the
word
“
may
”
with
conditions
that
would
reject
--
you
would
say
they
rejected
it.
the
magistrate
thought
this
was
just
a
fishing
expedition
for
evidence.
that's
not
a
ground.
he
has
to
believe
it's
not
a
fishing
expedition
for
evidence
and
that
there
is
good
cause
to
think
that
the
defendant
will
succeed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
those
circumstances
--
under
--
which
is
pretty
limited,
under
those
circumstances,
then
he
has
discretionary
authority
to
grant
a
hearing
at
which
the
defendant
will
be
able
to
show,
you
know,
that
there
is
not
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
was
committed
by
his
client.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
about
a
different
subject.
it's
not
we
work
through
osmosis
here.
it's
about
the
subject
of
quashing
a
warrant
or
it's
about
the
subject
of
injunction.
now,
grant
you,
a
grand
jury
thinks
it's
there,
but
it's
also
there
when
you're
talking
about
certain
bail
hearings.
