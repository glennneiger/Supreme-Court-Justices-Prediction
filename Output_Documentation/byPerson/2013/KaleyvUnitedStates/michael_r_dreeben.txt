mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
200
years,
the
rule
in
this
court
and
in
all
lower
courts
have
been
that
the
grand
jury's
determination
of
probable
cause
is
conclusive
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
case.
and
that
rule
has
been
extended
not
only
to
bringing
the
defendant
to
trial,
but
also
depriving
the
defendant
of
liberty,
imposing
occupational
restrictions
on
the
defendant,
imposing
firearms
restrictions
on
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
parallels
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
illustrate
that
the
process
for
determining
probable
cause
by
a
grand
jury
has
been
deemed
sufficiently
reliable
so
that
further
judicial
inquiry
is
not
warranted.
and
that
is
borne
out
by
two
features
of
the
grand
jury:
one,
the
way
it
operates;
and
the
second,
the
empirical
realities
of
what
it
has
produced.
the
grand
jury
is
set
up
as
an
independent
body
to
protect
the
defendant
from
unfounded
prosecutions.
it
is
structurally
independent
from
the
prosecution
and
the
courts.
and
it's
composed
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it
is
a
protection
in
the
following
sense,
mr.
chief
justice:
if
the
court
is
seriously
considering
departing
from
the
universal
rule
up
till
now
in
its
cases
and
in
other
english-speaking
courts
and
allowing
a
review
of
whether
there
is
probable
cause
after
the
grand
jury
has
found
it,
it
ought
at
least
to
have
a
good
reason
for
doing
so,
namely
some
reason
to
think
that
defendants
will
prevail
in
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
just
to
start
with
the
last
thing
that
you
said,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
way
this
court
has
analyzed
the
constitutional--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
wasn't
referring
to
monsanto,
justice
breyer.
i
was
referring--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i'm
not
referring
to
monsanto
court's
reservation
of
this
issue.
i
agree
with
you,
monsanto
did
not
decide
whether
there
is
a
hearing.
but
in
the
bail
context,
this
court
has
determined
that
a
grand
jury
indictment
is
sufficient
to
hold
the
defendant.
there
is
no
further
judicial
review
of
whether
the
defendant's
liberty
may
be
restrained.
and
so
that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
salerno
was
different
because
salerno
was
a
specific
statute
in
which
congress
enumerated
the
factors
that
the
judge
is
going
to
consider.
there's
never
a
reconsideration
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
indictment,
as
my
brethren--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
a
certain
class
of
cases,
justice
kennedy,
the
indictment
itself
creates
a
presumption
that
no
conditions
will
assure
the
safety
of
the
community
and
the
appearance
of
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
there's
--
under
salerno--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
kennedy,
when
the
government
seeks
to
detain
the
defendant,
the
court
has
to
make
a
determination
under
the
bail
reform
act,
not
because
of
the
constitution,
but
under
the
bail
reform
act--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
either
the
defendant
poses
a
danger
to
the
community
or
a
risk
of
flight.
in
considering
those
issues,
the
court
will
consider
a
proffer
from
the
government
on
the
nature
of
the
evidence
of
guilt.
it's
not
a
full-blown
adversarial
hearing
in
which
new
transcripts
are
being
presented,
new
witnesses
are
being
called,
the
government
has
a
burden
to
justify
its
entire
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
will
look
at
the
weight
of
the
evidence
under
the
bail
reform
act.
it's
not
revisiting
the
question
of
probable
cause.
that's
what's
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
squarely
contrary
to
what
this
court
held
in
united
states
v.
monsanto.
monsanto
considered
against
the
backdrop
of
caplin
&
drysdale,
which
said
forfeiture
of
funds
that
were
desired
to
be
used
for
attorney
fees
is
constitutional;
then
turned
to
the
question
of
can
those
funds
be
restrained
so
they
will
be
available
for
forfeiture
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
seeking
to
contradict
the
determination
of
probable
cause--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
it
is
seeking
to
contradict
the
other
determination
because
it's
asking
the
judge
to
find
that
there
is
no
probable
cause
when
the
grand
jury
has
found
that
there
is
probable
cause.
and
the
grand
jury's
determination
not
only
allows
the
government
to
bring
the
defendant
to
trial,
which
would
be
very
odd
if
the
court
had
found
that
there
is
really
no
probable
cause
for
these
charges,
they
are
legally
invalid.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
united
states
v.
monsanto
essentially
rejected
the
argument
that
there
is
any
discretion
not
to
restrain
the
funds.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
understand
that,
justice
breyer.
there
was
analysis
of
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--exactly.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
serious
question
that
monsanto
meant
to
preclude
free
floating
discretion.
what
it
did
was
focus
on
the
question
of
probable
cause,
and
the
court
squarely
held
that
assets
in
the
defendant's
possession
may
be
restrained
in
the
way
that
they
were
here
based
on
a
finding
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
assets
were
forfeitable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
let
me
start
with
the
fact
that
i
think
that
there
is
harm
and
there
is
very
little
benefit,
and
i
want
to
turn
to
both
sides
of
that
empirical
equation.
before
the
court
concludes
that
for
the
first
time
a
grand
jury
indictment
can
be
contradicted
by
a
judicial
finding
that
there
is
no
probable
cause,
albeit
on
different
evidence,
the
court
should
have
a
good
reason
to
think
that
grand
juries
go
awry
in
a
sufficient
number
of
cases
so
that
this
hearing
which
will
have
costs
as
i'll
describe,
is
worth
doing.
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
20
years
since
monsanto.
petitioners
can
point
to
not
a
single
instance
in
which
a
court
has
concluded
there
is
no
probable
cause
even
though
the
grand
jury
found
that
there
is
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
do
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
usually
with
the
lawyers
who
want
to
get
the
funds
so
they
can
be
hired.
and
they
try
to
get
hearings,
and
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
we
have
25
reported
cases.
i
would
amend
justice
kagan's
statement
about
those
cases
in
only
one
respect:
in
24
of
them,
the
defendants
lost
outright.
in
the
25th
one,
they
won
and
they
were
reversed
on
appeal.
that
is
accurate.
but
the
district
court
did
not
actually
find
that
a
grand
jury
had
erred
in
finding
probable
cause,
because
that
case
involved
a
civil
complaint,
not
a
grand
jury
indictment.
what
we
have
is
thousands
of
indictments,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
indictments
over
the
10-year
period
that
respondents
have
canvassed
in
talking
about
hyde
amendment
fee
awards
where
courts
have
found
no
probable
cause
for
a
prosecution.
he
has
pointed
to
four
cases.
there
have
been
660,000
indictments
during
that
time
period.
the
ratio
between
the
cases
in
which
the
system
didn't
work
and
the
grand
jury
malfunctioned,
and
the
cases
where
it
did
and
where
the
defendant
gets
the
opportunity
for
discovery,
fishing
expeditions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
talking
about
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
second
circuit,
seventh
circuit,
and
elsewhere
in
the
country
where
the
law
is
not
established,
defendants
can
seek
these
hearings.
in
the
20
years
that
they
have
been
available
to
be
sought,
not
one
has
produced
a
finding
of
no
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
with
you
that
those
cases
exist.
anecdotally,
they
exist,
where
the
government
determines
that
the
cost
of
exposing
its
witnesses,
the
dangers
to
witnesses,
the
potential
undermining
of
the
integrity
of
the
trial,
makes
it
too
high
a
price
to
go
through
this
hearing
or--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
that
doesn't
always
work,
mr.
chief
justice.
let's
keep
in
mind
that
this
statute
operates
in
its
core
in
drug
trafficking
cases,
in
serious
organized
criminal
cases,
where
the
exposure
of
the
identities
of
the
government's
witnesses
can
lead
to
serious
problems
of
obstruction
of
justice.
this
is
the
real
cost
of
these
kinds
of
hearings.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
government
is
unlikely
to
jeopardize
the
safety
of
its
witnesses--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
do
face
them.
i
cannot
quantify
them--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you're
correct,
i
did
ask,
and
i
received
anecdotal
responses.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
received
several
specific
anecdotes
of
instances
in
which
the
government
elected
not
to
proceed
with
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
group
numbers
in
which
offices
reported,
we
have
encountered
this
a
number
of
times.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it's
not
just
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
these
assets
are
generally
used
to
pay
restitution
to
victims
of
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
if
the
assets
are
paid
out
to
attorneys,
although
in
theory,
as
justice
scalia
explained,
it
is
possible
under
the
relation
back
principle
to
go
into
the
attorneys'
files
and
into
their
assets
and
recover
them,
in
practice
it
is
not
so
easy
to
do
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what's
wrong
with
it
is
that
it
basically
compels
the
government
to
try
the
entire
case
in
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
case
has
even
resulted
in
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
frequency
of
these
hearings
is
limited,
in
part
because
it's
rare
that
defendants
are
able
to
show
that
they
have
no
other
assets--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
also
the
stark
unlikelihood
that
the
defense
will
prevail
unless
the
government
is
forced
not
to
go
through
with
the
hearing
because
of
concerns
about
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't,
justice
breyer.
i
do
know
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
in
seeking
funds
for
forfeiture,
particularly
in
white
collar
cases
like
this,
is
to
pay
restitution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
a
fair
comment.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
government
does
believe
that
the
medical
providers
from
which
these
medical
supplies
were
obtained
and
then
sold
into
the
black
market
by
agents
of
a
company
are
victims
of
the
crime.
they
received
restitution
in
the
prosecution
of
one
of
the
co-conspirators
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
way
the
government
is
planning
to
proceed.
if
the
defense
is
able
to
come
up
and,
based
on
case
law
that
really
has
very
little
to
do
with
any
situation
like
this,
has
to
do
with
the
idea
that
public
officials
who
receive
bribes
haven't
deprived
the
state
of
its
entitlement
to
that
bribe
money
--
that's
the
lead
case
that
the
defendants
argue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
defendant
seeks
one,
yes.
and
there
was
the
opportunity
in
this
case
for
a
hearing
and
the
defendants--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
show
that
the
assets
that
are
restrained
are
not
actually
the
proceeds
of
the
charged
criminal
offense
or
another
way--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
would
be
up
to
this
court's
decision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'd
be
happy
to
have
the
defendants
bear
the
burden
of
proof,
but
i
think
the
courts
typically
have
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
to
show
traceability,
and
the
government,
therefore,
presents
limited
evidence,
but
it's
all
against
the
background
of
the
crime
not
being
called
into
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
typically,
justice
kennedy,
the
government
makes
a
proffer
of
the
evidence
that
it
intends
to
use.
the
proffer
is
very
limited,
it's
hearsay,
it's
a
description
of
the
crime
rather
than
a
detailed
evidentiary
presentation
of
the
kind
that
petitioners
want
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do
not
think
that
typically
resting
on
the
indictment
alone
will
satisfy
the
weight
of
the
evidence
factor.
but
the
hearing
that
is
provided
for
in
salerno
is
not
a
hearing
that
this
court
has
said
you
must
do
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
it
is
what
congress
has
established
as
a
requirement
in
the
bail
reform
act.
when
it
comes
to
due
process--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
the
same
inquiry.
the
bail
act
hearings
are
usually
very
summary.
they
do
not
involve
calling
witnesses.
they
do
not
involve
sworn
testimony.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
can
do
both
of
those
things.
this
is
largely
within
the
discretion
of
district
courts.
the
second
circuit,
which
probably
has
the
most
experience
with
these
hearings
under
monsanto,
has
held
that
hearsay
evidence
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
government's
burden
of
probable
cause.
what
happens,
then,
are
frequently
excruciating
fishing
expedition
cross-examinations
of
the
government
agent
in
the
defense
efforts
to
attempt
to
find
out
more
about
the
government's
case,
to
ask
for
additional
documents,
to
make
later
claims
that
brady
evidence
wasn't
produced
in
connection
with
the
monsanto
hearing
and
various
sanctions
should
fall
on
the
government.
and
the
hearings
do
generally
take
the
form
of
efforts
by
defense
to
obtain
some
strategic
advantage.
they
have
never
resulted
in
the
finding
of
no
probable
cause.
and
the
court's
question
i
think
here
is
really:
is
there
anything
on
the
defendant's
side
of
the
scale
other
than
the
abstract
desire
to
use
money
that
the
government
says
is
forfeitable
to
pay
for
attorneys?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
difficulty
is
that
we
have
to
actually
trace
the
specific
assets
into
the
defendant's
own
account.
and
if
the
defendant's
lawyer
has
spent
that
money
and
has
used,
you
know,
paid
it
out
in
salary,
paid
it
out
in
expenses,
it's
gone,
the
government
can't
make
that
tracing
argument.
it
can't
forfeit
substitute
assets
from
the
attorney,
so
it
has
to
go
under
some
state
law
theory
and
then
sue
the
lawyers
and
then
argue
that
the
funds
were
held
in
constructive
trust
for
the
government.
state
law
varies
widely
on
this.
it's
a
big,
messy,
uncertain
project
and
as
a
result
it
doesn't
happen
very
often.
typically
if
the
funds
are
released
to
the
attorneys,
they
will
be
gone.
and
if
the
defendant
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
convicted
of
a
serious
financial
crime
and
the
government
wants
those
assets
available
to
compensate
investors,
to
compensate
victims
of
food
and
drug
violations,
the
funds
are
not
there.
they
have
been
spent
on
an
attorney.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
caplin
&
drysdale,
those
funds
were
never
the
defendant's
funds
at
all.
what
happens
is
that
they
may
have
been
released
because
the
government
chose
at
a
hearing
not
to
contest
probable
cause
because
it
would
suffer
the
kinds
of
ill
effects
that
justice
alito
referred
to,
and
that
kind
of
--
“
blackmail
”
may
be
too
strong
of
a
word,
but
it
does
put
the
government
in
a
very--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that
would
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--those
high
bars
would
be
helpful.
but
once
the
defendant
clears
them,
the
government
faces
the
same
pressures.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
same
consequence
is
going
to
occur,
that
if
the
judge
does
find
in
that
one
in
a
million
case
which
has
not
yet
been
encountered
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
indictment.
you
will
have
the
defendant
proceeding
on
to
trial
in
a
judicial
system
that
is
honoring
the
finding
of
the
grand
jury
after
the
judge
has
concluded
to
the
contrary.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
different
in
the
bail
context,
because
the
--
the
judge
at
the
bail
hearing
is
never
questioning
probable
cause.
he's
only
questioning
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
justify
restraining
the
defendant.
thank
you.
