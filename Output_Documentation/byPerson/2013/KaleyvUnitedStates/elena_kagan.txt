justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
what
the
prospects
of
success
at
a
hearing
like
this
are?
you
know,
there's
an
amicus
brief
which
lists
25
cases
in
the
second
circuit
in
which
this
kind
of
hearing
was
held.
my
clerk
went
back
and
found
that
in
24
of
those
cases,
the
motion
was
denied
and
in
the
25th,
the
motion
was
granted,
but
then
reversed
on
appeal.
so,
then,
you
know,
it's
not
surprising
really.
i
mean,
probable
cause,
it's
a
pretty
low
bar.
so
what
are
we
going
through
all
this
rigamarole
for,
for
the
prospect
of,
you
know,
coming
out
the
same
way
in
the
end?
