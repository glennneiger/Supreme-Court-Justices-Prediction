justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
what
weight
does
the
court,
the
trial
court
in
this
hearing,
give
to
the
fact
of
the
indictment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
no
weight.
we've
now
had
a
hearing.
i
ignore
the
indictment
and
let's
have
a
trial.
that's
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
would
think
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
--
what
about
a
detention
hearing?
same
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be
the
government
under
a
detention
hearing
--
pardon
me.
the
trial
court
under
the
detention
hearing
ignores
the
fact
of
the
indictment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
was
a
case
with
very
substantial
documents,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
how
they
interpret
weight
of
the
evidence
at
this
--
the
bail
reform
act
says
that
the
trial
judge
must
determine
weight
of
the
evidence.
and
in
practice,
and
perhaps
in
reported
decisions
in
the
circuit,
do
the
courts
say
we
don't
need
to
talk
about
weight
of
the
evidence
once
there's
a
grand
jury
indictment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--end
of
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking,
perhaps
not
too
clearly,
i'm
asking
what
function,
what
weight,
what
relevance
do
courts
give
in
day-to-day
hearings
on
detention
to
the
bail
reform
act
requirement
that
judges
must
determine,
as
part
of
the
bail
determination,
the
weight
of
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
that's
two
different
things.
is
the
only
thing
the
judge
considers
the
risk
of
flight?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
don't
talk
about
risk
of
flight.
what
weight
does
the
judge
give
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
charges
have
merit
to
the
bail
reform
act's
direction
that
he
must
determine
the
weight
of
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
court
must
determine
that
under
the
bail
reform
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
concede
that
there
must
be
a
traceability
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
in
the
general
run
case.
so
you
agree
that
due
process
does
require
a
traceability
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
defendants
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
view
as
to
what
the
constitution
requires
in
that
respect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
dreeben,
one
other
question.
it's
the
question
i
asked
before.
i
still
don't
understand.
under
the
bail
reform
act,
the
issue
is
pretrial
detention.
the
defendant
says:
your
honor,
under
the
bail
reform
act
you
must
determine
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
this
is
a
skimpy
case.
the
judge
says:
the
grand
jury
is
all
i
need
as
probable
cause.
can
and
do
judges
say
that?
does
that
suffice
to
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
required
anyway,
then
certainly
the
due
process
argument
that
you
make
is
much
less
weighty.
if
we
have
to
go
through
this
anyway
for
detention,
why
not
do
it
for
distraint
of
property?
