justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
--
i'm
sorry.
that's
pretrial
detention
without
bail.
i
thought
justice
scalia's
question
had
to
do
with
detaining
someone
who
was
indicted
but
couldn't
make
bail.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why
in
that
situation
would
the
defendant
not
have
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
determination
by
a
judge
as
to
whether
there
was
probable
cause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
at
these
hearings
when
they
have
been
conducted,
what
do
they
look
like?
the
rules
of
evidence
would
not
apply,
i
assume,
so
the
government
could
call,
let's
say,
a
case
agent
who
would
provide
a
summary
of
some
of
the
evidence,
enough
of
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
to
establish
probable
cause
in
the
opinion
of
the
prosecution,
and
then
what
would
happen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
could
call
witnesses.
could
you
subpoena
witnesses?
could
you
require
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
government
witnesses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
this
was
an
unusual
--
that's
a
somewhat
unusual
situation
where
you
had
been
--
there
had
already
been
a
trial
of
someone
else
who
was
allegedly
involved
in
the
scheme.
but
what
if
that
was
not
the
case?
in
the
more
ordinary
situation,
what
would
happen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's
been
a
suggestion
that
if
the
judge
were
to
find
that
there
was
a
lack
of
probable
cause,
the
prosecutor
would
be
under
an
ethical
obligation
to
dismiss
the
charges.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
if
it's
the
same
evidence,
the
same
evidence
is
introduced
before
the
grand
jury.
let's
say
it's
a
credibility
determination.
the
grand
jury
finds
the
prosecution
witness
credible,
the
judge
finds
the
prosecution
witness
not
credible.
is
there,
then,
an
ethical
obligation
to
dismiss
the
charges?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
that
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
all
about.
all
the
talk
about
whether
--
about
defendants
being
exonerated,
that
the
judge
is
going
to
find
a
lack
of
probable
cause,
that's,
you
know,
that's
fantasy
land
for
the
most
part.
but
what
it's
really
about
is
about
discovery.
prosecutors
hate
preliminary
examinations.
when
do
they
ever
occur
in
federal
felony
cases?
they
are
always,
almost
always
eliminated
by
indictment.
the
defense
bar
hates
grand
jury
proceedings.
they
would
like
to
have
a
preliminary
hearing
where
they
get
some
discovery
of
the
government's
trial
case,
and
that's
what
this
is
all
about.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
important
is
the
nature.
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
what
is
going
to
take
place
at
this
hearing?
and
what
typically
happens
beyond
what
i
mentioned
before,
a
case
agent
taking
the
stand
and
providing
some
summary
of
the,
of
the
evidence
that
was
provided
to
the
grand
jury?
how
much
further
do
they
go?
is
the
defense
entitled
to
any
discovery?
do
they
subpoena
witnesses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
this
is
the
kind
of
hearing
that's
held
every
day?
i
thought
these
--
in
some
circuits,
it
is.
but
it's
held
occasionally.
