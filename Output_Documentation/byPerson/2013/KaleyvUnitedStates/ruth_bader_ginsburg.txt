does
it?
there
are
several
factors
that
are
taken
into
account.
one
of
them
is
weight
of
the
evidence.
are
you
equating
those
two
things,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
committed
the
offense
and
weight
of
the
evidence
as
one
of
several
factors
to
take
account
over
the
bail
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right
to
be
heard--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
your
--
if
your
position
prevails,
there
would
be
nothing
to
stop
the
defendant
from
using
those
assets
for
something
other
than
paying
an
attorney.
if
the
assets
are
unfrozen,
freely
available
to
the
defendant,
the
defendant
might
say:
i
will
settle
for
a
legal
aid
lawyer,
i
want
to
use
this
money
for
something
that
i
care
more
about.
it
--
there
would
be
no
control
on
that,
would
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
do
you
get
at--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then
there
--
then
there
is
the
anomaly
that
the
grand
jury
has
said
there
is
probable
cause,
this
defendant
can
be
prosecuted,
and
then
you
would
have
the
judge
make
a
determination
that
there
isn't
probable
cause
to
believe.
you
are
asking
a
judge
who
has
determined
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
preside
at
a
trial
because
the
grand
jury
has
found
that
there
is
probable
cause.
and
how
--
how
could
a
judge
allow
a
trial
to
go
on?
if
the
judge
concludes
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
this
defendant
for
this
crime,
how
could
the
judge
then
conduct
a
trial?
the
judge
would
be
overriding
the
grand
jury's
determination,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
the
next
step
be
that
the
judge
would
then
dismiss
the
indictment?
the
judge
has
found
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
charge
this
man
with
this
offense.
and
yet
you're
going
to
ask
that
same
judge
to
try
the
case
that
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
logic
of
your
position
is
if
there
is
to
be
this
hearing
on
probable
cause
and
the
judge
finds
that
there
is
no
probable
cause,
then
the
judge
dismisses
the
indictment.
how
could
you
ask
a
judge
who
thinks
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
then
conduct
a
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
something
about
plainly
tainted
assets.
i
thought
that
the
hearing
was
given
on
the
traceability
of
the
assets
to
the
crime.
so
on
that
part,
the
defendant
isn't
allowed
to
challenge
the
connection
between
the
assets
and
the
offense,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
everybody
agrees
with
that.
so
there
is
a
possibility
to
say
you
said
we
have
untainted
assets,
but
the
defendant
in
this
case
said,
i
concede
that
these
assets
are
related
to
the
charged
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
say
that
in
this
case,
because
counsel
had
been
retained
two
years
earlier,
that
the
court
was
presented
with
how
much
the
lawyer
was
going
to
charge
to
represent
the
defendants
at
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
dollar
amount
was
known
so
that
the
court
could
then
say,
well,
we'll
unfreeze
assets
to
that
extent
but
no
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
--
what
was
the
figure?
counsel
was
identified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
--
what
was
the
amount
of
money
that
the
defendants
wanted
spared
from
the
seizure
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that
point,
mr.
dreeben,
would
you
clarify
what
happens
at
the
end
of
the
road
if
the
defendant
is
convicted?
i
think
you
said
in
theory
you
could
go
after
the
lawyers
to
recoup
the
fee,
but
that
would
be
difficult.
can
you
explain
what
is
the
difficulty?
we
know
how
much
the
fee
was.
