mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judgment
enforced
against
ebia
in
this
case
was
entered
by
a
non-article
3
bankruptcy
court
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
this
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
as
violating
the
separation
of
powers.
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
is
not
nearly
a
matter
of
private
interest
to
the
litigants.
rather,
it
carries
the
force
of
law
that
is
binding
on
other
courts,
binding
on
the
executive
branch
which
must
enforce
the
judgment,
and
even
binding
on
the
legislature
which
cannot
reopen
the
judgment.
the
entry
of
final
judgment
of
the
united
states
is
the
ultimate
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
under
article
3,
just
as
the
enactment
of
legislation
is
the
ultimate
exercise
of
the
legislative
power
under
article
i.--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
judgment
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court
was
not
an
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
but
rather
appellate
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
section
1334
is
clear
that
it
confers
the
district
court
original
jurisdiction,
but
once
a
judgment
has
been
entered
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
review
by
the
district
court
is
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction
under
section
158.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
your
honor,
the
entry
of
judgment
is
the
act
of
the
judicial
branch
that
carries
the
force
of
law.
the
issuance
of
a
report
and
recommendation
by
a
magistrate
does
not.
it's
only
after
the
exercise
of
judgment
and
the
entry
of
judgment
that
it
has
binding
effect.
binding
on
the
other--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes,
your
honor.
because
the
active
entry
of
judgment--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the
act
of
entering
judgment
is,
both
as
a
legal
matter
and
as
a
practical
matter,
different
from
the
appellate
--
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
act
of
entering
judgment,
the
district
court
must
--
if
it
is
the
one
entering
the
judgment,
has
to
determine
that
judgment
is
properly
entered.
it's
a
proper
exercise
of
the
appellate
--
of
the
article
3
power.
the
district
court
would
have
the
discretions
under
ninth
circuit
law
consistent
with
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby
to
carry
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
allow
the
record
to
develop
further.
that
option,
available
to
the
district
court
when
it's
sitting
as
a
matter
of
original
jurisdiction,
is
not
available
to
the
district
court
sitting
on
appeal.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
true.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
on
appellate
review,
it
had
two
options:
affirm
or
reverse.
as
an
original
matter,
though,
it
would
have
had
a
third
option,
which
would
have
been
to
deny
the
motion
at
that
time
to
let
the
record
develop
more
fully.
but
more
fundamentally--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i
truly
believe
that
on
this
record,
where
there
clearly
were
disputes
between
the
two
affidavits,
that
an
article
3
judge
would
not
have
entered
summary
judgment
as
an
original
matter.
sitting
as
an
appellate
court
where
its
decision
was
going
to
be
subject
to
appellate
review
immediately,
perhaps
its
analysis
was
different.
but
i
think
more
fundamentally,
the
absence
of
a
judgment
entered
by
a
court
with
authority
to
do
so
means
that
the
appellate
court
also
lacks
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
this
court
has
so
recognized
in
ayrshire
collieries,
in
the
glidden
case--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
section
158(a)
speaks
in
language
of
the
district
court
exercising
appellate
jurisdiction.
it
uses
the
word
“
jurisdiction
”.
so
once
the
--
in
157(b),
a
core
matter
such
as
this,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
delegated
authority
to
hear
and
determine
and
enter
final
judgment
subject
to
review
pursuant
to
section
158.
section
158(a)
specifies
that
the
district
court
is
exercising
appellate
jurisdiction
in
that
event.
so
the
district
court--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it
uses--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes,
158(a)
says--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i'm
using
the
government's
amicus
brief,
the
statutory
appendix
that's
on
page
4a.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
is
in
our
brief.
the
reason
i
cite
to
the
government's
brief
is
it
also
has
1334.
it's
slightly
more
comprehensive.
so
on
page
4a
of
the
government's
statutory
appendix,
section
158(a),
"the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
appeals.
"
this
court
has,
in
numerous
decisions,
attributed
significance
to
congress's
use
of
the
word
“
jurisdiction
”,
that
congress
knows
what
the
word
means
and
when
it
uses
that
word,
it
means
it
is
jurisdictional.
the
--
section
1334,
on
the
other
hand,
which
is
on
page
14a
of
the
government's
statutory
appendix,
1334(b)
says
that
"the
district
courts
shall
have
original
but
not
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
proceedings
arising
under
title
11.
"
so
the
district
court
does
have
original
jurisdiction
at
the
outset,
but
when
it
has
referred
the
matter
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
bankruptcy
court
has
entered
final
judgment,
then
pursuant
to
157(b)
and
pursuant
to
158(a),
the
district
court
is
now
exercising
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
to
be
clear,
congress
designated
fraudulent
conveyance
actions
as
core.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
that
what's
constraining
the
court
is
the
language
that
congress
enacted.
congress--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
an
ambiguity,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
the
ambiguity
--
i
actually
think
there
is
no
ambiguity
because--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--congress
--
congress
very
clearly
distinguished
a
dichotomy
between
those
cases
in
which
the
bankruptcy
courts
were
to
issue
proposed
findings
and
rec
--
conclusions
and
those
that
it
was
to
hear
and
determine.
the
cases
that
bankruptcy
courts
were
to
hear
and
determine
were
cases
in
which
the
bankruptcy
courts
were
to
enter
final
judgment
subject
only
to
appellate
review--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
are
--
there
are
several,
your
honor.
and
part
of
the
problem
is
that
the
question
of
how
to
construe
that
language
in
157(b)
does
not
only
affect
how
stern
claims
are
going
to
be
handled,
but
also,
all
other
claims
under
157
(b).
congress
very
clearly
wanted
an
efficient
system
in
which
bankruptcy
judges
would
enter
judgment
and
there
would
only
be
appellate
review
by
the
district
court.
if
the
court
reads
157(b)'s
“
hear
and
determine
”
language
to
also
encompass
the
authority
to
issue
non-final
reports
and
recommendations,
that
would
not
be
limited
to
the
class
of
cases
covered
by
stern
that
are
core,
but
not--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it's
--
unfortunately,
the
statutory
language
does
not
admit
of
severance
of
the
kind
that
respondents
suggest.
and
that's
because
fraudulent
conveyance
actions
are
core,
not
simply
because
they're
listed
in
157(b)(2)(h),
but
because
they
are
proceedings
that
arise
under
title
11.
that's
the
definition
of
core
proceedings.
and
so
even
if
the
court
were
to
line
out--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
--
i
don't
think
that
157(b)
envisions
that
the
district
court
could
do
that.
the
district
court's
review
under
--
of
a
judgment
entered
under
157(b)
is,
on
appeal,
pursuant
to
158,
which
is
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
not
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
clearly
not
what
congress
provided.
it
had
different--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
--
that's
true.
and--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
and
--
and,
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
think,
your
honor,
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
first
is
that
by
changing
the
definition
of
“
core
proceedings
”,
there
are
other
collateral
consequences
for
other
provisions
of
the
code.
under
section
1
--
1334(c),
for
example,
there
is
an
abstention
in
certain
noncore
proceedings.
and
so
congress
has
defined
the
scope
of
the
abstention
according
to
the
same
language
that
it
uses
in
157(b)
whether
a
proceeding
arises
under
title
11
or
does
not
do
so,
but
is
merely
in
relation
to
a
case
under
title
11.
so
if
the
court
goes
and
revises
what
congress
has
provided
as
the
definition
of
core
in
157(b),
there
will
be
collateral
consequences
for
other
statutes
that
congress
had
enacted.
but
the
second
point
is
that
there
are,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
was
suggesting,
policy
decisions
that
really
only
congress
can
make
in
deciding
how
to
respond
to
stern,
because
one
can
compare,
for
example,
the
provisions
of
157(c)(1),
which
is
the
bankruptcy
judge
issuing
a
proposed
findings
and
conclusions,
and
the
magistrates
act,
636.
the
two
are
actually
quite
different.
the
magistrates,
for
example,
are
assigned
a
specific
motion
to
consider
and
issue
a
report
and
recommendation
on.
by
contrast,
the
bankruptcy
court
in
(c)(1)
exercises
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
proceeding,
including
up
to
conducting
a
trial
in
something
that
isn't
subject
to
jury
trial,
and
then
issuing
a
report
and
recommendation
to
the
district
court.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
but
the
formalities
matter.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
--
to
begin,
i
think
the
formalities
do
matter
and
not
only
do
i
think
so.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
absence
of
a
judgment
entered
with
authority
means
the
absence
of
appellate
jurisdiction
as
well.
and
all
the
appellate
court
can
do
is
to
vacate
and
remand.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
quite
--
quite
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
the
parties
may
not,
by
their
agreement,
confer
jurisdiction
that
would
not
otherwise
exist.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
to
the
contrary,
your
honor,
in
schor,
the
court
made
clear
that
where
the
structural
features
of
the
constitution
are
at
issue,
that
is
precisely
where
parties
cannot
be
depended
upon
to
assert
the
interest,
and
it
cannot
be
joined
by
consent.
and
here
we
have
an
example.
the
constitutional
violation
identified
by
the
court
in
stern
existed
for
25
years
before
the
issue
finally
made
it
to
this
court.
in
part
because
parties
were
reluctant
to
assert
that
issue
before
a
bankruptcy
court
in
which
its
fate
held.
the
--
the
issues
here,
the
other
side
says
there
is
no
structural
problem
because
there's
no
aggrandizement
or
encroachment.
but
to
the
contrary,
congress
has
reserved
to
itself
power
over
bankruptcy
judges
that
the
constitution
denies
it
over
article
3
judges.
the
president's
power
to
appoint
has
been
encroached
upon.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
think
in
large
part
they
do.
although
there
is
a
distinction,
perhaps
an
important
distinction,
that
in
the
magistrates
act,
the
consent
requirement
is
built
into
the
statute.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
problem
that
this
court
identified
in
stern
and
that
we
identify
here
applies
equally
to
the
magistrates.
but
we
have
explained
that
that
argument,
even
if
not
accepted
in
full,
would
distinguish
our
case
from
the
magistrates
act,
because
here,
the
act
enacted
by
congress
was
unconstitutional.
it
assigned,
irregardless
of
consent,
this
action
to
determination
and
final
judgment
by
a
bankruptcy
judge.
the
court
considered
this
statute
and
held
it
unconstitutional
in
stern.
so
if
consent
were
to
cure
the
problem
here,
then
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
would
depend
solely
on
the
consent
of
the
parties.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
was
considering
in
the
first
instance
whether
consent
as
a
limiting
feature
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
non-article
3
body
meant
that
there
was
not
the
types
of
structural
problems
that
the
court
identified
in
stern,
then
it
would
be
as
part
of
the
determination
whether
there
was
or
was
not
an
article
3
violation
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
only
--
only
the
former,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
--
that's
right.
i
was
answer
--
just
answering
the
question--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--about
the
logic
of
the
argument
and
how
far
it
went.
and
--
and,
i
guess,
again,
what
we
suggest
is
that
there
might
be
a
distinction
when
the
court
is
considering
a
statute.
and
as
schor
lays
out
the
many
factors
that
the
court
might
consider,
the
fact
that
consent
is
a
limiting
feature
on
the
non-article
3
body's
jurisdiction
might
lead
the
court
to
conclude
there
was
no
article
3
violation.
but
here,
where
there
was
no
consent
in
this
statute,
the
court
has
already
held
in
stern
that
there
was
an
article
3
violation.
the
statute
does
not
constitutionally
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
bankruptcy
courts.
so
if
there
is
jurisdiction
here,
it
would
be
purely
a
matter
of
private
party
consent.
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
has
held
is
not
permissible
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
cannot
be
implied
consent,
but
in
roell,
as
--
as
a
construction
of
the
magistrates
act,
the
court
held
that
consent
must
be
knowing
and
voluntary.
there,
of
course,
the
litigant
had
notice
because
the
statute
had
advised
the
litigant
that
it
had
the
right
to
refuse
consent.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
was
--
i
was
--
i
thought
i
was
answering
a
different
question.
in
our
view,
consent
cannot
be
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
a
non-article
3
court.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
express
or
implied.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
so
this
is
the
subsidiary
argument,
our,
really,
fallback
argument,
which
is
to
say,
even
if
consent
could
play
a
role,
it
would
only
be
where
that
was
part
of
the
statute,
and
thus,
part
of
the
court's
analysis
of
whether
this
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
so
there
--
there
were
two
cases
that
the
other
side
had
cited,
roell
and
mcdonald,
for
that
point.
but
in
each
case,
the
statute
itself
featured
consent
as
a
limiting
feature
on
the
non-article
3
court's
authority.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
four
points
in
response.
first
with
respect
to
the
history.
hecker's
and
kimberly
were
not
instances
in
which
the
non-article
3
actor
entered
the
judgment
of
the
united
states.
in
hecker's,
the
court
compared
the
referee's
actions
akin
to
a
jury.
and
a
jury,
of
course,
only
finds
facts.
only
the
court
can
decide
whether
to
enter
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
jury's
verdict.
likewise
an
arbitrator
can
decide
facts
pursuant
to
the
parties'
contract,
but
until
they
bring
it
to
the
court
and
judgment
is
entered
confirming--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--although
northern
pipeline,
because
the
party
had
objected,
did
not
address
the
question
whether
consent--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
your
honor.
because
the
earlier
cases
do
not
establish
an
authority
to
enter
judgment
of
the
united
states
by
a--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
thomas
certainly
does
not
foreclose
the
argument
that
i'm
making
because--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
and
kimberly,
again,
referred
to
the
confirmation
of
the
award,
again
the
judgment
being
entered
by
the
court.
the
--
in
roell,
which
really
marks
the
furthest
extent
of
the
recognition
of
consent
and
the
role
that
it
can
play
with
respect
to
judgments
and,
of
course,
the
article
3
argument
was
not
advanced
by
the
parties
there.
both
parties
agreed
that
consent
would
be
sufficient.
but
significantly,
even
in
roell,
the
court
said
that
the
consent
would
have
to
be
knowing
and
voluntary
consent.
and
we
have
the
opposite
of
that
here.
because
both
the
legislature
and
the
judiciary
had
told
ebia
that
it
had
no
right
to
an
article
3
judge
for
pretrial
motions.
and
although
my
friend--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
your
honor,
to
the
contrary,
and
you
don't
need
to
hypothesize
because
the
record
is
clear,
the
motion
was
to
withdraw
for
purpose
of
conducting
a
jury
trial
because
our
client
recognized
that
ninth
circuit
precedent
healthcentral.
com
explicitly
held
after
granfinanciera,
that
although
you
might
have
a
seventh
amendment
jury
trial
right
to
an
article
3
judge,
that
did
not
entitle
you
to
article
3
determination
of
pretrial
motions
including
summary
judgment
motion
on
a
fraudulent
conveyance
claim.
it
was
directly
on
point.
our
client
cited
that,
recognized
it,
it
had
no
right
to
article
3
court
prior
to
trial.
so
the
motion
to
withdraw
was
limited
to
the
motion
for
a
trial
if
the
court
got
that
far.
so
the
suggestion
that
in
the
answer
we
disputed
that
fraudulent
conveyance
actions
are
core
is
not
consistent
with
the
record.
the
complaint
had
listed
eight
causes
of
action,
several
of
which
were
core,
several
noncore,
and
then
a
single
concluding
allegation
that
the
proceeding
was
core.
under
ninth
circuit
law
we
rightly
denied
that
allegation.
