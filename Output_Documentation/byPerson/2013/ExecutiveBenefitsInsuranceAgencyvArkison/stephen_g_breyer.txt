justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
there
is
a
--
i
want
you
to
get
on
a
bit,
because
i'd
say
the
question
that
we're,
at
least
for
me,
is
one
of
congressional
intent,
not
in
necessarily
your
case
but
in
future
cases.
and
the
argument
that
is
that
the
statute
can
be
read,
it
silences,
to
say
if
congress
wanted
to
allow
people
in
noncore
cases
to
submit
reports
and
recommendations,
they
surely
would
have
wanted
it
in
what
they
thought
was
a
core
case
that
turned
out
to
be
noncore.
so
i
want
your
response
to
that,
and
i
would
couple
that
with
my
own
research
of
an
opinion
when
i
was
one
the
first
circuit
about
the
fraudulent
conveyances,
and
they
are
about
bankruptcy.
i
grant
you
that
there
is
a
statute
of
elizabeth,
it's
a
legal
matter
for
several
hundred
years,
but
the
person
who
is
defrauded,
the
people
defrauded
are
the
creditors.
and
in
most
instances,
the
fraud
consists
of
transferring
property
to
a
friend,
rather
than
a
creditor,
where
you
know
you
are
insolvent.
now,
that
is
a
legal
matter.
but
it
is
about
bankruptcy.
and
it's
state
law,
but
it
is
about
bankruptcy.
and
it
is,
according
to
you
--
i
may
not
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
we
have
to
take
it
as
noncore.
but
why
wouldn't
congress
have,
of
course,
wanted
reports
and
recommendations
if
they
couldn't
get
what
they
really
wanted,
which
is
to
have
the
bankruptcy
judge
decide
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
and
i
would
have
said
they
were
right.
but,
nonetheless,
i
am
faced
with
case
law
that
says
to
the
contrary.
okay.
so
my
question
is,
if
they
couldn't
get
--
if
they
couldn't
get
what
they
wanted,
which
is
to
have
the
bankruptcy
judge
decide
it,
why
wouldn't
they
at
least
have
wanted
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
write
a
report
and
recommendations
and
send
it
on
to
the
district
judge
so
he
can
review
it
de
novo?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
find
an
ambiguity
in
that
language,
then
you
would
say
i
would
be
sensible
to
read
it
contrary
to
what
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
okay.
that's
--
i
got
that
point.
one
is
you
say,
it's
totally
unambiguous,
you
can't
do
anything
about
it.
but
if,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
--
take
it
as
a
hypothetical
--
it's
ambiguous
enough
to
get
what
congress
wanted.
now,
can
you
give
me
any
argument
against
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
it.
i'd
like
an
answer
to
my
question.
my
question
is
i
want
you
to
assume
that
the
language
is
at
least
somewhat
ambiguous.
and
on
that
assumption,
is
there
any
reason
not
to
adopt
the
government's
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
were
two
aspects
to
the
article
3
problem.
one
affects
the
individuals
and
it's
an
unfairness,
and
the
other
is
structural,
as
justice
scalia
has
said.
but
both
are
at
issue.
and
so
where
you
have
only
a
structural
issue
and
it's
a
question
of
getting
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
work
and
nobody's
hurt
by
it,
doesn't
that
at
least
cut
in
favor
of
interpreting
a
statute
to
prevent
chaos
--
not
chaos,
that's
too
strong
--
but
to
prevent
--
to
allow
the
function
of
the
court
to
work
better?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
basically,
i
think,
that
the
words
are,
for
core
proceedings,
it
gives
the
power
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
hear
and
determine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
i
tell
the
assistant
chef,
you
deal
with
orders
for
bacon
and
eggs,
that
might
mean
that
the
assistant
chef
can
deal
with
eggs
orders
alone,
or
it
might
mean
only
those
that
order
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
thought
perhaps
it's
ambiguous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
true,
but
if
you
were
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
would
have
--
you
would
have
thought
this
was
a
core
proceeding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
says,
you
know,
of
course
i
didn't
object.
i
am
faced
with
all
kinds
of
precedent
that
say
it's
impossible;
and
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
to
object.
that
wasn't
consent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
assume
here
on
this
point?
in
thomas,
this
court
held
that
what
northern
pipeline
establishes
is
that
congress
cannot
vest
in
a
non-article
3
court
the
power
to
adjudicate
without
consent
of
the
litigants.
so
that's
the
holding.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
go
back
into
--
and
the
power
of
agencies
and
whether
we
want
to
reverse
the
things
that
were
held
in
1938
and
so
forth,
i
guess
we
should
have
briefing
on
that.
am
i
supposed
to
assume
that
this
is
a
case
--
i
thought
i
assumed
what
we
have
held
before
in
respect
to
constitutionality.
not
whether
northern
pipeline
extends
to
where
it
is
with
consent
of
the
parties.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
heard
what
i
read
from
thomas.
i
was
just
reading
it,
and
it
talks
about
without
consent.
so
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
we
going
to
open
up
these
issues
again?
because
i
have
my
own
views
on
that,
but
they
don't
necessarily
--
they
won't
necessarily
command
a
majority,
but
i
think
we
should
have
briefing.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
are
we
supposed
to
go
into
that
or
do
we
just
take
as
assumed
what
thomas
said
and
stern
said,
and
i
think
--
you
know
what
i
said.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
we
should
have
briefing
on
the
point
if
we
are
going
into
it.
