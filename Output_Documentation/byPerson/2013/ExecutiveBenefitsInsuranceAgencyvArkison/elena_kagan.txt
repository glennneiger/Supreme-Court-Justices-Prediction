justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
would
we
have
to
do
that,
mr.
hallward-driemeier?
why
couldn't
we
say
that
this
presents
a
distinct
problem,
these
stern-type
claims,
and
it's
really
a
problem
of
severability,
and
that
we
should
understand
this
statute
in
light
of
stern
as
essentially
creating
this
middle
category
which
congress
clearly
meant
to
have
the
treatment
that
the
noncore
claims
get.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
we
do
try
though,
again,
to
apply
severability
principles
to
write
the
statute
that
congress
would
have
written
if
it
had
known
about
a
constitutional
ruling.
and
that's
essentially
what
justice
breyer
is
suggesting.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
once
again
about
magistrates,
the
exact
same
arguments
would
apply
to
them?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
see
why
that
would
make
a
difference
if
you
say
the
problem
is
congressional
aggrandizement
or
congressional
encroachment
of
a
certain
kind.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
difference
in
that
case,
if
congress
says,
by
the
way,
you
can
consent
to
it.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
gannon--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
gannon,
could
you
say
a
word
about
the
relevance
of
arbitration
here?
because
i've
been
trying
to
figure
out,
if
there's
an
article
3
problem
irrespective
of
consent
when
congress
adopts
some
kind
of
scheme
for
alternative
adjudication,
why
schemes
of
mediation
and
arbitration
wouldn't
similarly
be
constitutionally
problematic.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
that
would
suggest
that
arbitration
is
more
constitutionally
problematic
because
it
--
it
extends
--
you
know,
it
goes
--
it's
further
away
from
the
supervisory
authority
of
the
district
court.
justice
elena
kagan
a
matter
of
contract
versus
a
matter
of
consent?
like
i
said,
you
understand
the
difference.
