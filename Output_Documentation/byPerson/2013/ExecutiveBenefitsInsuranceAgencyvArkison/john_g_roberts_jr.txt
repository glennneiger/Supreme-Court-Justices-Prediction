chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-1200,
executive
benefits
insurance
agency
v.
arkison,
the
chapter
7
trustee
of
the
estate
of
bellingham
insurance
agency.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
pottow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
concede
that
your
case
would
be
--
you
would
not
have
a
case
if
we
were
dealing
with
factual
findings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
right.
we've
been
talking
about
backup
arguments
to
backup
arguments.
your
central
argument
is
that
the
consent
of
the
parties
can
overcome
what
stern
identified
as
a
structural
separation
of
powers
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
that's
my
question.
is
there
any
other
case
where
we've
said
the
consent
of
the
parties
can
overcome
a
constitutional
structural
separation
of
powers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we've
already
told
the
district
court,
haven't
we,
that
its
article
3
status
is
infringed
when
he
refers
or
when
there's
a
reference
to
a
non-article
3
tribunal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
district
court
refers
the
case
to
his
law
partners,
and
that's
fine
with
the
parties,
that
law
partner
can
enter
a
final
judgment
in
the
case
subject
only
to
appellate
review?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
special
masters
do
not
enter
final
judgment
subject
only
to
appellate
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
appellate
review
is
the
important
thing.
the
article
3
court,
under
your
submission,
is
giving
up
its
authority
to
enter
factual
findings.
it's
giving
that
authority
to
a
non-article
3
tribunal,
and
it
can
only
review
those
findings
under
clearly
erroneous
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know
it's
the
current
system
under
the
magistrate
judges.
we
held
that
unconstitutional
in
the
bankruptcy
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought
severability
was.
if
you
carve
--
if
you
find
part
of
it
unconstitutional,
you
ask
whether
what
is
left
can
stand.
you
don't
say
that
we're
going
to
rewrite
what
is
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
it
may
be
because
the
particular
claim
at
issue
in
stern
was
one
that
wasn't
expected
to
arise
in
the
normal
course
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
position
is
--
i
mean,
the
authority
to
decide
cases,
which
is
our
constitutional
birthright,
we
said
in
stern
that
congress
can't
take
that
away
from
us.
and
your
position
is
that
two
parties
who
come
in
off
the
street,
if
they
agree,
they
can
take
that
away
from
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
the
parties,
the
parties
who
are--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
said,
"it's
the
consent
of
the
parties
that
allows
a
proceeding
we
have
determined
to
be
unconstitutional
to
go
forward.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
point
of
everything
that
you
said
is,
they
do
not
comply
with
article
3.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
district
court
have
that
authority
after
the
entry
of
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract
between
two
parties.
nothing
happens
in
an
arbitration
until
you
get
a
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
enforcing
the
contract.
it
seems
to
me
totally
different
from
the
situation
we're
talking
about
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
--
i'm
posing
a
question
to
you,
i
guess.
[laughter]
courts
enforce
contracts
all
the
time.
they
don't
enter
judgments
beyond
their
article
3
authority
simply
because
the
two
parties
before
them
agree
that
they
should.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hallward-driemeier,
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
