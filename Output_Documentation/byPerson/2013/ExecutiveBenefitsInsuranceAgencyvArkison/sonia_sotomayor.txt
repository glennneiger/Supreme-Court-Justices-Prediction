are
you
talking
about
a
mere
formality?
are
you
arguing
that
because
it
was
the
bankruptcy
judge
and
not
the
district
court
judge
who
signed
the
final
judgment,
that
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we
vacated
and
remanded,
and
the
district
court
looked
at
this,
because
it's
already
seen
it,
and
basically
just
signed
below
the
line
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
signed,
you
would
be
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
reviewed
this
case
de
novo.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it
decided
that
there
were
no
issues,
no
factual
issues
in
dispute
and
that
the
law
clearly
applied
the
way
it
did.
i
don't
understand
why
that
option
was
taken
away
from
it
on
appellate
review.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
saying,
contrary
to
our
case
law,
that
you
can
never
have
implied
consent?
we
have
held
differently
in
other
cases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
just
save
your
time.
i'll
ask
on
rebuttal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
can
i
go
to
that
for
a
second?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
let's
deal
with
statutory
language,
okay?
i
get
the
core
of
your
argument
to
be
as
follows;
pardon
the
puns.
that
for
statutorily
core
proceedings
that
constitutionally
are
not
core--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
should
treat
them
as
noncore
proceedings.
am
i
at
your
point?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we're
going
to
accord
them
the
same
treatment--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
do
i
do
with
federal
rules
of
bankruptcy
procedure
7012--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
explicitly
states,
quote:
"in
noncore
proceedings,
final
orders
and
judgments
shall
not
be
entered
on
the
bankruptcy
judge's
order
except
with
the
“
express
consent
of
the
parties
”.
"
so,
now
you're
telling
me
we're
going
to
have
a
third
category.
makes
very
little
sense
to
me,
okay?
which
is
you
need
express
consent
for
a
magistrate
judge
to
issue
a
final
judgment
in
a
noncore
proceeding,
but
you
can
have
express
or
implied
consent
to
enter
the
final
judgment
in
core
proceedings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that
makes
very
--
i
understand
treating
it
like
noncore
proceeding,
but
if
we're
going
to
treat
it
that
way,
then
i
think
you
have
to
treat
it
that
way
for
all
purposes,
not
pick
and
choose
the
ones
you
want.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
language
of
roell,
the
magistrate
judge's
language
didn't
use
the
word
--
the
language
in
roell,
the
magistrate
judge's
language
didn't
use
the
word
“
express
consent
”.
it
just
--
the
part
--
"the
clerk
shall
give
written
notice
to
the
parties
of
their
opportunity
to
consent
to
the
exercise.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
word
“
express
”
was
not
in
the
magistrate
judge's
act.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
here
you
have
to
express
consent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
got
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
now
i
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
answer
suggested
it
because
we
he
was
claiming
the
fraudulent
conveyance
claim
in
his
answer
was
noncore.
so
he
had
the
basis
of
the
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
had
an
outstanding
motion
to
withdraw
the
reference.
and
the
district
court
gave
you
the
option
of
proceeding
with
that
motion
and
having
it
determine
the
rest
of
the
case
or
to
go
and
listen
--
or
go
back
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
let
the
bankruptcy
court
manage
this
and
you
chose
the
latter.
i
think
obviously
for
the
reasons
your
--
your
adversary
speaks
about,
because
your
co-defendant
had
won
in
bankruptcy
court.
i
think
you
were
riding
your
chances.
