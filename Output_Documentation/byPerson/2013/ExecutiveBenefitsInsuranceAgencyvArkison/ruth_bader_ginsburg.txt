why
should
that
matter
given
that,
after
the
bankruptcy
judge
ruled,
the
u.s.
district
court
gave
de
novo
review
to
this
case
and
entered
a
final
judgment
that
met
all
the
requirements
of
article
3?

why
would
the
--
why
would
the
district
judge
do
that
when
the
district
court
said
that
there
are
no
disputed
issues,
no
relevant
disputed
issues
of
fact
and
it's
a
pure
legal
question?

it
uses
the
word
“
appellate
”--

--in

justice

but
the
definition
--
the
definition
was
linked
to
a
purpose.
you
--
you
laid
out
very
nicely
the
two
categories;
the
one
category
where
the
bankruptcy
judge
enters
a
judgment,
the
other
category
where
the
bankruptcy
judge
makes
recommendations.
so,
if
you
--
the
purpose
of
the
classification
was
to
indicate
the
bankruptcy
judge
can
make
the
final
judgment,
can
only
make
recommendations.
suppose
the
district
judge
had
said,
i'm
uncertain
after
stern
about
whether
the
bankruptcy
judge
had
authority
to
enter
a
final
judgment.
so
i
am
going
to
treat
that
summary
judgment
as
a
recommendation.
i'll
treat
it
as
a
recommendation
and
i
will
review
it
de
novo.
i
agree,
i
enter
final
judgment.
if
the
district
judge
had
said
that,
then
you
would
have
no
case,
right?

but
she
did
say
that
ebia
had
the
burden
to
demonstrate
error
in
bankruptcy
courts.
