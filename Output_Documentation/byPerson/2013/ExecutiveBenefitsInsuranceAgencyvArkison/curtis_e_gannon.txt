mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
a
party
may
consent
to
have
a
fraudulent
conveyance
claim
determined
by
a
bankruptcy
judge.
and
even
in
the
absence
of
consent,
principles
of
severability
justify
treating
such
an
action
as
a
noncore
proceeding
in
which
a
bankruptcy
judge
may
enter
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
there's
also
one
other
aspect
of
our
argument
that
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
this
morning,
which
is
that
we
think
that
even
if
consent
is
not
adequate
to
cure
the
constitutional
violation
or
if
you
find
that
there
is
not
adequate
consent
on
this
record,
we
think
that
it
would
still
be
open
to
you
to
find
that
petitioner
has
forfeited
this
constitutional
argument.
constitutional
arguments
can
be
forfeited.
he
has
not
--
he
did
not
advance
this
argument
at
any
point
--
any
reasonable
point
before
the
bankruptcy
judge,
before
the
district
judge,
until
he
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
indeed,
i
think
it's
telling
that
this
court
had
already
granted
certiorari
in
stern
and
had
already
heard
oral
argument
in
stern
before
the
district
court
even
ruled
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
you
might
have
thought
the
same
thing.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
if
there
was
true
futility
--
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
consent
argument
now,
justice
breyer.
i'm
talking
about
a
forfeiture
argument
for
purposes
of
preserving
an
argument
on
appeal.
and
if
it
were
truly
futile,
i
think
that
a
court
of
appeals
could
overlook
that
type
of
forfeiture.
i
don't
think
that
it
was
futile
here.
i
think
it
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
stern
itself
came
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
litigants
there
were
making
those
arguments,
and
indeed
the
healthcentral.
com
case
the
petitioner
relies
upon
just
had
a
discussion
of
the
seventh
amendment.
i
don't
think
it
clearly
foreclosed
this
claim
for
purposes
of
the
constitutional--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
i
think
it's
--
he
certainly
did,
as
my
colleague
already
pointed
out
on
page
8
0
of
the
joint
appendix
and
paragraph
2.1
of
the
answer
denied
the
allegation
that
this
was
a
core
proceeding.
and
if
you
look,
then,
to
157(c)(1)
and
(2),
the
statute
made
consent
relevant
at
that
point,
and
rule
7012,
which,
justice
sotomayor,
you
were
earlier
quoting,
made
it
clear
that
he
was
obliged,
then,
to
--
or
petitioner
was
obliged,
then,
to
--
to
give
consent
or
not.
but
if
i
can
turn
to
the
severability
question,
which
was
also
the
focus
of
a
lot
of
the
argument
before,
justice
scalia,
you
pointed
out
that
congress
can
rewrite
the
statute
the
way
it
wants
to.
and
that's,
of
course,
true.
but
it
is
always
the
case
when
this
court
gets
to
a
severability
analysis
that
congress
didn't
get
its
first
option.
here,
congress
did
include
a
severability
clause
in
the
1984
act.
it's
in
section
119,
and
it
says,
if
any
provision
of
this
statute
or
any
application
thereof
is
held
to
be
unconstitutional
we
want
the
rest
to
stand.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
don't
think
any
rewriting
is
required
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
this
is
actually
essentially
what
the
court
has
already
said
in
stern.
in
stern,
on
page
2620,
this
court
characterized
the
effect
of
its
decision
as
being,
"the
removal
of
vicky's
counterclaim
there
from
core
bankruptcy
jurisdiction.
"
and
the
consequence
of
that
is
that,
because
the
congress
had
divided
the
world
into
core
and
noncore
proceedings
in
the
wake
of
northern
pipeline,
thinking
that
the
distinction
between
them
was
core
proceedings
were
ones
in
which
bankruptcy
judges
would
have
authority,
constitutional
authority
to
enter
final
judgments;
noncore
proceedings
were
ones
in
which
they
could
not
do
that
without
consent,
or
they
would
only
be
able
to
provide
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
and
in
the
same
paragraph
where
this
court
that
the
effect
of
its
decision
was
effectively
to
remove
this,
that
type
of
counterclaim
from
core
jurisdiction,
it
said
it
did
not
expect
that
this
decision
would
meaningfully
change
the
division
of
labor
between
the
bankruptcy
and
district
court
judges,
precisely
because
pearce
marshall
was
not
contesting
the
idea
that
bankruptcy
judges
would
still
be
able
to
enter
proposed
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
that
--
that
may
be
something
the
court
was
thinking.
in
that
particular
paragraph,
the
court
mentioned
the
fact
that
pearce
marshall
was
not
contesting
the
district
court's
ability
to
take
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
and
as
mr.
pottow
already
observed,
many
district
courts
have
already
taken
this
action
in
response
to
stern.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
pages
15a
to
17a,
we
list
25
of
those
districts.
since
our
brief
was
filed,
two
more
districts
have
adopted
similar
provisions
in
rhode
island
and
in
new
hampshire.
and
we
think
that
that
is
telling.
i
also
think,
with
respect
to
the
underlying
constitutional
claim,
if
i
could
elaborate
a
little
bit
on
what
my
colleague
was
saying
in
response
to
the
questions
from
the
chief
justice
about
instances
in
which
article
3
judges
may
indeed
delegate
the
ability
to
enter
certain
decisions
with
which
the
district
court's
subsequent
ability
to
over
--
to
look
over
that
decision
will
be
cabined
by
the
action
that
has
happened
with
the
consent
of
the
parties.
my
friend
was
talking
about
the
heckers
case.
that
was
one
in
which
the
order
of
reference
specifically
provided
that
judgment
would
be
entered
in
conformity
with
a
referee's
report,
"as
if
the
cause
had
been
heard
before
the
court.
"
so
that
was
--
that
was
one
where
the
district
court
didn't
come
into
it
at
that
point.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
depending.
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
here
--
and
this
court
has
repeatedly,
in
the
context
of
considering
article
3
objections
in
bankruptcy,
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
absence
of
consent
is
relevant.
under
schor,
and
the
court
is
obliged,
i
think,
to
look
into
all
the
circumstances
surrounding
this,
and
there
are
lots
of
things
that
make
this
far
from
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose,
because
this
is
more
like
the
magistrate
judge
scheme.
and,
indeed,
in
some
ways
it's
slightly
more
limited.
this
is
an
instance
where
bankruptcy
judges
are
not
just
somebody
off
the
street
that
a
district
court
is
choosing
to
decide--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
not
the
parties
that
are
choosing.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
you
determined
that
it
was
unconstitutional
in
the
absence
of
consent,
and
it's
not
just
the
consent
of
the
parties.
i
think
it
is
important
here,
as
it
was
in
--
in
the
magistrate
judge
context
in
roell,
in
peretz,
in
gomez.
this
court
has
previously
recognized
that
in
the
magistrate
judge
context,
consent
makes
or
breaks
the
difference
between
whether
it's
okay
for
a
magistrate
judge
to
oversee
felony
voir
dire,
and
it
has
subsequently
compared
that
to
entry
of
civil
judgments.
in
roell,
it
sustained
the
ability
of
a
magistrate
judge
to
enter
a
civil
judgment.
here,
bankruptcy
judges
are
not
just
people
off
the
street
chosen
by
the
parties.
they
are
people
who
are
appointed
by
article
3
judges.
they
are
removable
only
by
article
3
judges.
they
never
get
a
case--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--they
themselves
are
not
article
3
judges,
that
is
certainly
true.
but
they
never
get
a
case
unless
it
is
referred
to
them
by
an
article
3
judge,
and
then
the
article
3
judge
reserves
the
ability
to
withdraw
the
reference
and,
therefore,
they
don't
have
--
they
are
now
unable
to
do
anything
without
that
imprimatur
from
the
district
court,
and
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
--
i
don't
think
as
a
statutory
matter
that
157(d),
which
is
the
provision
that
allows
the
district
court
to
withdraw
the
reference,
it's
possible
that
that
can't
be
done
at
that
point,
but
i
think
that
it
is
sensible
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
remedy.
if
the
--
if
the
entry
of
final
judgment
by
the
bankruptcy
court
was
a
constitutional
violation,
i
think
it
is
a
sensible
remedy,
as
i
discussed
before,
to
deem
that
final
judgment
to
be
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
as
this
court
concluded
in
stern,
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
vested
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
allocation
of
authority
between
bankruptcy
judges
and
district
judges
contained
in
section
157
is
not
of
subject
matter
jurisdictional
consequences.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
--
obviously,
we
don't
think
that
--
that
these
schemes
here
in
the
bankruptcy
judge
context
and
the
magistrate
judge
context,
which
are
--
which
are
hedged
around
with
lots
of
procedural
protections
and
statutory
protections,
rise
to
that
level.
but
i
do
think
that
a
principal
difference,
if
the
court
were
looking
to
distinguish
arbitration
from
these
types
of
concerns,
is
that
the
arbitration
is
more
purely
private.
although
there's
statutory
authorization,
the
arbitrators
are
generally
not
federal
employees.
bankruptcy
judges,
by
contrast,
are
actually
units
of
the
district
courts.
they
are
within
article
3.
they
are--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i'm
--
i'm
loathe
to
say
that
it's
further
away
because
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
separation
of
powers
distinction
between--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
do--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
cases
like
heckers
and
kimberly,
courts,
in
light
of
a
previous
reference
from
the
court
and
the
consent
of
the
parties
agreed
to
have
their
power
of
de
novo
review
limited.
obviously
that's
not
what
happened
here,
but
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
