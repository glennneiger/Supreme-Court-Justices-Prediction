mr.
john
pottow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
alito
is
entirely
correct,
for
the
reason
we
can
win
the
most
straightforward
way
is
because
he
got
everything
he
wanted
in
the
courts
below.
and
i
would
like
to
also
address
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
what
could
have
happened
in
the
hypothetical
situation.
but
if
i
may
begin,
please,
i'd
like
to
address
justice
scalia's
point
about
where's
the
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
and
unfortunately,
my
friend
and
i
disagree,
because
i
think
the
statute
under
157(b)(1)
is
unambiguous
in
my
favor.
so
if
i
could
take
you
back
to
the
statute,
and
i'll
use
the
solicitor
general's
brief
for
convenience.
157(b)(1)
is
the
provision
by
which
district
courts,
if
they
want
to
--
there's
no
compulsion
on
these
article
3
officers
--
if
they
want
to,
they
can
refer
matters
to
bankruptcy
judges.
and
it
says,
when
there
is
a
matter
referred,
that
they
may
hear
and
determine
the
matter
and
may
enter
an
order
or
judgment.
my
interpretation,
i
believe,
is
the
more
natural
one
of
"may
enter
an
order
of
judgment.
"
it's
a
permissive
grant
of
authority.
there's
no
compulsion
to
enter
an
order
and
judgment.
they
can
simply
hear
and
determine
the
matter
and
not
enter
an
order
and
judgment.
and
i
can
contrast
this
textual
language
--
you
don't
have
to
go
very
far
--
down
in
(c)(1)
and
(c)(2),
where
(c)(2),
there
was
only
one
“
may
”,
they
don't
have
the
double
“
may
permissive
grant
of
authority
”.
and
there's
--
and
in
the
noncore
matters,
there's
a
--
a
“
it
shall
”,
when
“
it
shall
determine
”.
they
use
the
verb
“
shall
”
in
(c)(2).
so
i
think
that
(b)(1)
with
two
uses
of
“
may
”
is
very
clear
that
when
a
matter
is
referred
under
(b)(1),
they
may
enter
an
order
of
judgment,
but
don't
have
to
enter
an
order
of
judgment.
and
i
think
this
gets
us
around
his
difficulty--
mr.
john
pottow
--so
if
there
is
a
judgment,
i
would
concede
that
we
then
have
an
appeal
that
occurs,
justice
kennedy.
but
what
is
critically
important
why
i
think
that
doesn't
create
a
problem--
mr.
john
pottow
--if
there
is
a
district
--
for
example,
in
a
noncore
proceedings--
mr.
john
pottow
--i'm
sorry.
in
a
core
proceeding
where
there
would
be
a
judgment
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
i
would
concede
that
that
would
be
an
appellate
matter
before
the
district
court,
if
there
was
a
full
judgment.
mr.
john
pottow
no.
mr.
john
pottow
no.
the
“
may
--
the
”
may
"prerogative,
justice
scalia,
is
with
the
district
court.
"
"the
district
court
may
refer
to
it
and
it
may
refer
to
a
final
judgment
or
may
not.
"
mr.
john
pottow
at
the
instruction
of
the
district
judge.
i
don't
believe
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
the
authority
to
feel
lazy
or
disinclined.
mr.
john
pottow
in
the
order
of
reference,
so
we
have
to
go
back
to
157(a),
which
is
what
--
what
starts
with
the
whole
reference
of
cases
from
district
courts.
recall
that
a
bankruptcy
court
is
a
unit
of
the
district
court.
so
as
an
institutional
matter,
it's
the
district
court
that
exercises
jurisdiction.
under
1334,
the
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
bankruptcy
is
vested
in
the
district
court.
now,
as
a
matter
of
which
officer--
mr.
john
pottow
--i
--
i
use
both
of
those
“
mays
”
if
i
may,
justice
scalia.
and
--
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
revision
post
stern
of
many
district
courts
that
government
puts
forward
in
appendix
of
how
these
courts
have
changed
their
orders
of
references
have
explicitly
used
this
power.
and
they
say
for
matters
in
which
we
refer
a
statutorily
core
proceeding,
we
would
--
but
there
is
a
stern
claim
that
arises.
so
when
we
refer
a
claim
and
you
think
that
article
3
presents
a
problem,
we
do
not
want
you
to
enter
a
final
judgment.
on
those
referred
proceedings,
we
only
want
you
to
enter
a
report
and
recommendation.
so
the
district
courts
below
are
working
this
out
by
changing
their
orders
of
references
and
not
having
them
enter
judgment.
mr.
john
pottow
i
think
it
has
to
come
from
a
textual
disagreement
with
my
friend.
he
says
the
phrase
“
may
hear
and
determine
”
should
be
read
to
mean
must
determine
and
enter
a
final
judgment.
and
i
think
the
textual
phrase
“
may
hear
and
determine
”
and
"may
enter
an
order
or
judgment.
"
suggests
that
they,
if
referred
to
by
the
district
court,
may
enter
a
judgment.
mr.
john
pottow
oh,
because
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
pottow
--i
see.
i
don't
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
the
issuance
of
a
report
is
a
matter
of
such
significance
that
there
would
need
to
be
an
explicit
reference
to
what
issue
in
a
report.
a
judgment,
if
you
contrast
section
157--
mr.
john
pottow
--but
with
consent
of
the
parties?
mr.
john
pottow
that
would
be
a
special
master
situation,
i
think,
justice
scalia.
if
they
--
if
they
referred,
and
the
district
--
yes,
the
district
court
would
have
inherent
authority
to
refer
an
issue
to
a
special
master.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
mr.
john
pottow
and
--
and
our
position
would
be
that
the
issuance
of
a
report
does
not
require
a
statutory
authorization
the
way
the
entry
of
a
judgment
requires
a
statutory
authorization.
so
the
contrasting
treatment
under
157(c)
of
noncore
matters
is
very--
mr.
john
pottow
--yes.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
and
--
and
if
there's
--
further,
justice
breyer,
there's
a
successive
“
may
”
afterwards,
after
the
bacon
and
eggs,
"and
may
prepare
a
dessert
as
well.
"
that's
even
more
permissive
in--
mr.
john
pottow
--yes.
and
that
was--
mr.
john
pottow
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
pottow
and
that
was
the
practice--
mr.
john
pottow
--yes.
and
that
was
a
practice
even
before
stern.
some
courts
did
that;
they
had
them
just
refer
on
straight-up
core
claims
to
give
the
reports
and
recommendations.
there's
a
case
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
called--
mr.
john
pottow
--but
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
pottow
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
dichotomy.
i
think
that
--
what
they're
worried
--
i
believe
what
the
congress
is
worried
about
is
by
putting
express
constraints
on
the
entry
of
a
judgment,
for
precisely
the
reasons
mr.
hallward-driemeier
says
that
judgments
are
a
matter
of
some,
at
least
formalistic
significance,
that
they
put
a
constraint
on
what
you
can
do
regarding
entry
of
a
judgment.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
but
i
--
i
want
to
be
clear.
i'm
not
shoehorning
them
into
the
category
of
noncore.
i'm
saying
we
should
accord
them
the
same
treatment
that
is
accorded
to
noncore
proceedings.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
mr.
john
pottow
yes.
mr.
john
pottow
i
think--
mr.
john
pottow
--i
--
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
give
you
some
hope,
justice
sotomayor,
which
is
there
is
amendments
to
rule
7
012
that's
percolating
up
to
this
court
for
--
for
consideration
to
address
the
issue.
in
the
interim,
this
is
what
happened
in
roell.
in
roell,
we
had
a
rule
of
procedure
that
said
there
must
be
express
consent
before
there
is
the
--
the
trial
before
a
magistrate
judge,
a
civil
trial
before
a
magistrate
judge,
which
we
do
believe
is
the
exact
same
system
as
the
bankruptcy
court
judge.
and
what
this
court
held
was
when
there's
a
violation
of
that
rule,
right?
when
there's
not
express
consent,
if
there
is,
in
fact,
true
consent
based
on
the
conduct,
then
consent
is
what
matters
and
it
can
trump
the
rule.
and
that's
the
square
holding
of
roell.
so
we
would
argue
that--
mr.
john
pottow
--no,
but--
mr.
john
pottow
--no,
no,
no,
no.
so
in
the
act,
in
the
statute,
there
was
just
a
reference
to
consent,
just
like
we
have
here
in
noncore
proceedings
reference
to
consent.
in
the
rules--
mr.
john
pottow
--yes.
in
--
in
the
rules,
there
is
a
requirement
under
bankruptcy
for
express
consent,
and
under
roell,
there
was
a
rule
for
a--
mr.
john
pottow
--okay.
mr.
john
pottow
may
i
--
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
raised
and
also
back
to
justice
alito's
and
justice
ginsburg
before.
what
makes
this
unusual
if
--
even
if
i
do
concede
that
it's
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
it's
unlike
all
the
cases
cited
when
talked
about
the
limited
appellate
jurisdiction
of
something
like
a
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there's
a
statutory
constraint.
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
can't
enter
judgment
if
it
wants
to
to
fix
a
trial
court
that
forgot
to
enter
judgment.
by
contrast,
district
courts
in
bankruptcy
can
enter
judgments;
they
have
both
appellate
and
original
jurisdiction.
they
can
withdraw
the
reference
from
a
bankruptcy
court
under
157(d)
and
they
can
enter
judgment.
so
the
petitioner
in
this
case
got
everything
it
wanted.
it
had
an
article
3
consideration
of
its
fraudulent
conveyance
defense
before
chief
judge
pechman
of
the
western
district
of
washington,
and
they
lost.
and
on
--
on
page
45a
of
the
pet.
app,
you
can
see
that
chief
judge
pechman
meticulously
spells
out
her
standard
of
review.
she
says
--
she
spends
a
whole
page
on
it
saying
this
is
going
to
be
de
novo
review,
and
she
writes
a
12-page
opinion
with
complete
de
novo
review,
saying
this
is
why
you
lose
on
the
state
claim;
this
is
why
you
lose
on
the
federal
claim;
this
is
why
you
lose
on
the
alter
ego
claim.
and
she
says
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
that
has
been
submitted
on
this
record.
mr.
john
pottow
yes,
that
is
--
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
a
unique
factual
posture,
because
other
--
you
can't
have
de
novo
review
of
a
fact
that
there'd
be
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here
today.
and
regarding
his
--
my
friend's
secondary
argument
that
even
if
consent
is
permissible
under
the
constitution,
and
with
respect,
i
do
believe
this
court
has
held
that
consent
is
permissible
as
a
grand
constitutional
matter,
the
trilogy
of
magistrate
cases
of
peretz
and
roell
and
gonzales
make
it
clear
that
consensual
voir
dire
is
okay;
and
in
discussing
consensual
voir
dire,
this
court
explicitly
says
because
voir
dire
is
comparable
in
importance
to
entry
of
civil
judgment
with
the
consent,
which
is
what
magistrate
judges
can
do.
so
i
believe
this
court
has
already
blessed
the
entry
of
civil
judgment
by
magistrate
judges
upon
the
consent
of
the
parties
as
a
constitutional
matter
for--
mr.
john
pottow
--i
don't--
mr.
john
pottow
--i
think
that
would
be
--
i
don't
have
any
case
authority
for
whether
they
can
do
that
or
not.
and
i
share
your
honor's
skepticism
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
create
a
statutory
problem.
but
the
question
we
have
here
is
whether
there's
an
article
--
even
if
we
concede
a
statutory
violation,
which
i
don't,
by
the
way;
i
think
that
this
is
--
it's
very
clear
that
there
was
consent
of
the
parties,
that
they
went
before
the
bankruptcy
judge,
and
he
went
in
with
wide
--
eyes
wide
open.
so
i'm
spending
all
this
time
talking
about
a
backup
argument,
as
to
if
we
assume,
arguendo,
that
the
bankruptcy
judgment
was
illegitimate,
we
still
win.
and
that's
why
i
said
it's
the
most
straightforward
way
to
resolve
this
case.
if
it
was
illegitimate,
we
still
win
because
of
the
de
novo
review.
my
friend
tries
to
disparage
chief
judge
pechman's
and
say
well,
it
really
wasn't
de
novo
because
even
though
she
spent
a
page
saying
i'm
doing
a
de
novo
review,
i
found
the
word
“
substantial
”
and
“
evidence
”
juxtaposed
on
page
50a
of
the
pet.
app.
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
her
opinion.
i
think
if
you
read
her
analysis,
it's
quite
de
novo;
she
goes
through
all
the
evidence
that's
submitted
and
says
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact;
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
pottow
that
--
she
does
say
that
at
one
point
in
her
opinion.
but
i
believe
if
we
read
the
analysis
in
its
context,
it
is
clear
that
she's
according
a
full
de
novo
review
of
the
claims.
and
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
she
misunderstood
the
--
the
standard
of
review
that
should
be
done
and
the
true
de
novo
nature
of
it.
but
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
comment
on
my
friend's
backup
argument.
if
--
if
the
court
agrees
with
me
that
article
3
is
not
imperiled
by
consensual
adjudicative
regimes
like
the
magistrate's
civil
judgments
and
the
bankruptcy
court
noncore
proceedings
which,
by
the
way,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
in
stern
itself,
you
did
quote
section
157(c)(2),
which
is
the
noncore
consensual
proceedings
in
an
opinion
exclusively
devoted
to
article
3.
my
friend
says,
well,
as
a
backup,
even
if
that's
constitutionally
okay,
i
have
to
have
notice
that
i
can
withhold
my
consent.
and
under
the
statute,
it's
clear
that
on
a
noncore
claim
under
157(c)(2),
the
parties
have
to
consent.
and
he
says,
but
i
had
a
stern
claim
so
i
didn't
really
know
that
i
was
a
noncore
claim
and
could
withhold
my
consent.
so
it's
a
one-off,
quirky
argument
he's
making
because
he
had
a
stern
claim
before
stern.
that's
belied
--
sorry.
mr.
john
pottow
i
was
going
to
say,
that's
belied
by
the
pleadings
in
his
--
in
his
answer
to
the
complaint,
which
is
at
page
8
0
of
the
joint
appendix
on
the
jurisdictional
allegations
of
the
trustee,
this
is
a
core
proceeding.
he
says
denied.
so
he
thought
he
had
a
noncore
proceeding.
mr.
john
pottow
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
would
slightly
rephrase
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
what
stern
defined
as
the
problem
was
the
adjudication
of
the
private
right
without
the
consent
of
the
parties.
so
i
think
it's
already
intrinsic
in
how
stern--
mr.
john
pottow
--well,
in
the
heckers
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
material,
the
old
--
the
old
special
master's
case,
that's
what
happened.
there
was
a
reference
to
a
referee.
and
when
there's
--
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
two-part
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
not
just
the
consent
of
the
parties,
remember;
it's
the
referral
by
the
district
court.
so
if
the
district
court
feels
that
its
article
3
authority
is
being
impinged
upon,
it
has
no
obligation
to
refer
matters
out
to
a
bankruptcy
judge.
the
parties
can
say,
we
consent.
we
want
to
go
to
the
bankruptcy
judge.
mr.
john
pottow
no,
in
--
i
--
that's
why
i
said
i
think
it's
two
necessary
conditions.
i
think
there
has
to
be
both
district
court
permission
to
grant
the
reference
out
and
the
consent
of
the
parties.
okay.
mr.
john
pottow
that's
what
heckers
said.
heckers
--
and
that
--
that's
basically--
mr.
john
pottow
--yes,
that's
a
special
master.
that's
what
a
special
master
is.
mr.
john
pottow
well,
technically
if
we
want
to
go
through
the
procedure
of
what
these
equity
officers
did,
was
they
would
prepare
their
report,
and
because
they're
acting
as
officers
of
the
court,
and
then
the
clerk
of
court
enters
judgment.
and
so
the
adjudicative
thinking--
mr.
john
pottow
--that
--
that
is
the
current
system
under
the
magistrate
judges
under
636.
mr.
john
pottow
no,
you
held
it
unconstitutional
regarding
an
objecting
defendant.
there's
been
hundreds
of
years
of
consensual
adjudication
with
these
inferior
judicial
officers,
as
that
they
were
called
in
the
earlier
cases,
such
as
go-bart.
they
are
officers.
they're
inferior
judicial
officers,
and
they
are
controlled
by
the
article
3
judiciary.
the
article
3
judiciary
retains
the
control
to
use
them
or
not
use
them
as
they
want,
and
parties
can't
be
forced
to
do
them
over
their
--
without
their
consent.
so
when
this
court
has
had
opportunity
to
address
article
3
concerns
of
this,
they
have
always
relied
upon
the
lack
of
consent
as
a
problem.
and
that's
why
this
court's
formulation
in
stern,
i
think,
is
critical,
just
following
union
carbide,
and
indeed
every
opinion
in
northern
pipeline,
going
back
to
the
macdonald
case
under
the
old
act.
what
matters
missing
is
the
lack
of
consent.
plenary
matters
can't
be
tried
without
consent
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act.
when
there
is
consent,
this
court
ruled
under
macdonald,
that's
fine.
indeed,
when
there's
implied
consent,
this
court
held
in
klein
against
baker
in
the
american
college's
amicus
brief,
that's
fine.
and
as
the
american
college
also
lays
out
well,
these
old
statutory
cases
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act
were
interpreted
with
constitutional
values
in
mind.
the
old
act
was
very
cryptically
drafted
and
tersely
drafted,
so
this
court
used
constitutional
principles
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
the
old
bankruptcy
act
and
upholding
the
consensual
adjudication
of
plenary
matters
when
there
is
consent.
so
our
submission,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
yes,
we
do
think
that
consent
matters.
and
the
final
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is,
my
friend
has
this
narrative.
he
said,
well,
how
do
you
know
i
consented
through
my
implied
conduct
to
the
noncore
claim?
remember,
he
did
plead
it
was
noncore
in
his
answer,
and
--
my
red
light.
mr.
john
pottow
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
his
codefendant
won
before
the
very
same
bankruptcy
judge.
so
he
made
a
tactical
decision
he
is
trying
to
second-guess
ex
post
now
that
he's
lost.
