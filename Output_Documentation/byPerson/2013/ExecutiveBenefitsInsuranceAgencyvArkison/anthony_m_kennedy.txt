justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
will
it
be
conceded,
so
far
as
you
know,
by
your
friends
on
the
other
side
that
this
was
appellate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it
that
makes
it
appellate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
bear
on
the
question
whether
this
is
appellate?
do
you
agree
that
this
is
appellate,
once
the
district
judge
--
district
court
has
the
matter
in
front
of
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
is
a
judgment
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
you
would
concede
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
