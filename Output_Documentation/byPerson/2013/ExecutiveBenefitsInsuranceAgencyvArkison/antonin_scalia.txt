which
is
where?
where
are
you
reading?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
it
wasn't
in
your
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
ambiguity
we
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
non-ambiguity
we
are
talking
about?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
--
if
we
believe
that
the
word
“
determine
”
means
make
a
final
judgment,
which
you
assert
it
means,
so
that
there's
no
ambiguity,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
statute
in
which
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
only
authorized
to
make
recommendations
in
some
situations
and
to
make
final
judgments
in
others.
and
surely,
there's
a
problem
with
a
district
judge
altering
that
disposition--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
just
saying,
oh,
i
know
you're
supposed
to
make
a
final
determination,
but
just
for
fun,
give
me
your
recommendation.
i
mean,
that's
just
contrary
to
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
might
have
--
might
have
provided
that
if
it
had
known
about
stern,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
do
we
sit
here
to
write
the
statutes
that
congress
would
have
written--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
knew
about
some
future
events?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
is
article
3
not
violated
so
long
as
the
parties
are
happy?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
parties
agree
to
have
a
--
an
article
3
court
decide
a
case
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide,
and
so
long
as
no
harm
is
done
to
the
parties,
it's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
confusing
me.
i
thought
you
--
you
did
say
that
there
can't
be
implied
consent
or
even
express
consent
to
what
happened
here.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
express
or
implied.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
--
you
read
me
--
want
me
to
read
that
--
that
when
a
district
judge
refers
the
matter
to
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
hear
and
determine
and
to
enter
an
appropriate
order,
the
bankruptcy
judge
can
say,
you
know,
i'm
just
too
busy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
on
easter
vacation
and
i
may
hear
and
determine
it,
and
i
may
enter
appropriate
orders,
but
i
don't
feel
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that
it
may
refer.
it
says,
"bankruptcy
judges
may
hear
and
determine.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
bring
the
“
may
”
over
to
the
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
“
may
”
that
you're
concerned
with
is
the
“
may
”
in
(a),
not
the
“
may
”
in
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
the
other
side
says
is
that's
very
nice,
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
does
not
give
the
bankruptcy
court
the
authority
to
enter
a
--
a
simply
recommendation
for
what
has
been
defined
as
a
core
proceeding.
for
core
proceedings,
what
the
statute
says
is
you'll
--
is
you'll
determine
it.
and
you're
saying,
well,
it
says
that,
but
since
it's
been
held
unconstitutional,
we're
going
to
shift
this
over
to
the
--
to
the
category
in
which
they
--
they
can
issue
an
order
and
recommendation.
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's
not
my
problem.
my
problem
is
--
is
not
why
they
don't
have
to
enter
an
order
and
judgment.
my
problem
is
why
they
are
authorized
to
issue
a
recommendation.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
come
from?
they're
not
issued
--
they're
not
authorized
to
issue
recommendations
for
core
proceedings.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
really?
i
mean,
can
a
district
judge
sort
of
--
you
know,
it's
not
terribly
important
because
it's
just
a
recommendation.
so
i'm
going
to
refer
it
to
my
former
partner,
you
know,
my
former
law
partner.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
even
with
the
consent
of
the
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
a
special
master.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
has
statutory
authority
to
do
that.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
here
to
refer
a
matter
to
a
bankruptcy
judge
for
nothing
other
than
a
recommendation,
except
for
noncore
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
can
do
that
for
core
--
for
those
core
proceedings
that
were
not
held
unconstitutional
under
stern,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
just
refer
them
and
say
just
give
me
the
eggs.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
need
the
bacon.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
determine
it;
just
give
me
your
recommendation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
dichotomy
set
forth
in
the
statute
disappears
once
you
say
“
hear
and
determine
”
means
either
“
hear
and
determine
”
or
“
hear
or
determine
”.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
dichotomy
of
the
statute
disappears.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
statement
that
the
district
court
here
has
both
original
and
appellate
jurisdiction
because
it
can
recall
the
reference
to
the
bankruptcy
judge.
can
it
recall
the
reference
after
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
issued
his
decision
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
entered
a
judgment
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
that
it's
okay
without
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
say
it
is
okay
with
consent.
they
didn't
address
the
point.
