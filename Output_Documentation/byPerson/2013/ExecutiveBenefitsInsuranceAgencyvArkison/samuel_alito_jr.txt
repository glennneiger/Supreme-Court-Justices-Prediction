samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
here's
something
--
i'm
sorry.
here's
something
that
happens
every
day.
a
district
judge
refers
to
a
magistrate
judge
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
magistrate
judge
issues
a
report
and
recommendation.
the
district
judge
reviews
it
de
novo
and
may
agree
or
disagree.
if
it
agrees,
the
district
court
will
enter
summary
judgment.
i
don't
see
a
difference
other
than
a
purely
semantic
difference
between
that
situation
and
what
happened
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
none
of
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
we
have
this
case
in
front
of
us.
we
don't
have
every
other
possible
case
that
could
implicate
this
issue.
we
have
one
case
and
it
involves
summary
judgment.
and
so
there
isn't
--
there
are
no
findings
of
fact,
and
there
is
no
substantive
difference
between
a
district
court's
reviewing
a
report
and
recommendation
on
summary
judgment
and
what
happened
here.
i
--
i
have
heard
nothing
other
than
formalities.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
do
they
matter
for
article
3?
maybe
they
matter
for
statutory
reasons.
why
do
they
matter
for
article
3?
what
your
client
got
was
exactly
--
substantively
exactly
what
your
client
would
have
gotten
had
this
been
referred
to
a
magistrate
judge
for
a
report
and
recommendation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
to
clarify
what
you're
saying
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
magistrates
act?
are
you
saying
that
it
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
allows
magistrate
judges
to
try
matters
by
consent,
or
are
you
saying
further
that
it
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
allows
a
district
judge
to
refer
a
dispositive
matter
to
a
magistrate
judge
for
a
report
and
recommendation
subject
to
de
novo
review,
or
both?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
former
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
see.
