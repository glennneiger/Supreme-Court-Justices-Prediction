mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
iub's
arguments
here
would
transform
younger
abstention
from
the
exception
into
the
rule
for
state
agency
adjudications.
virtually
all
state
agency
decisions,
even
on
issues
of
federal
law
would
be
subject
to
challenge
only
in
state
court.
there's
no
basis
for
that
broad
rule
in
this
court's
decisions.
younger
abstention
began
with
the
traditional
principle
going
back
to
the
time
of
the
framing
that
federal
courts
sitting
in
equity
shouldn't
intrude
on
state
criminal
cases.
this
court's
decisions
have,
of
course,
expanded
younger
slightly
beyond
criminal
cases.
in
huffman,
in
moore,
in
trainor,
the
court
extended
younger
to
civil
enforcement
actions
in
aid
of
state
criminal
laws.
in
middlesex
county
in
dayton,
the
court
extended
younger
to
administrative
disciplinary
actions.
but
all
of
these
cases
are
still
coercive
civil
enforcement
actions,
where
the
state's
enforcement
interests
are
similar
to
those
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
your
honor,
we've
argued
that
there
is
no
magic
to
the
--
to
the
word
‵‵
coercive
′′.
coercive
is
a
sort
of
shorthand
that
the
lower
courts
have
used
to
mean
coercive
in
the
ways
that
this
court's
younger
decisions
are
coercive.
so,
i
think
the
question
of
how
far
this
court
has
extended
younger
is
really
the
heart
of
this
case
as
opposed
to
sort
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
‵‵
coercive
′′.
and
i
think,
as
i
was
saying,
the
court
started
with
criminal
cases,
and
it
extended
that
principle
somewhat
in
huffman
and
moore
and
trainor.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
yes.
there's
--
they're
--
but
they're
a
specific
kind
of
state
enforcement
action.
in
each
of
those
cases,
this
court
held
that
the
state
enforcement
action
was
in
aid
of
criminal
law.
so
it's
a
small
extension
of
the
traditional
principle
that
courts
sitting
in
equity
don't
intrude
on
state
criminal
cases.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
yes,
the
court
went
further
in
a
couple
of
different
directions,
and
i
want
to
try
to
address
them
separately,
if
i
may.
the
first
direction
is
really
the
dayton
middlesex
county
cases.
those
were
administrative
disciplinary
actions.
and
i
think
the
dayton
case
is
actually
especially
helpful
here
in
drawing
the
kind
of
line
that
you're
looking
for,
your
honor.
the
dayton
case
helps
to
give
some
substance
to
exactly
what
is
a
civil
enforcement
proceeding.
so
in
--
in
dayton,
the
ohio
civil
rights
commission
conducted
an
investigation
and
found
that
the
school
there
had
engaged
in
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
the
commission
proposed
a
consent
order,
and
it
told
the
school
if
you
don't
agree
to
this
consent
order
under
which
you
need
to
hire
back
the
professor
--
i
mean,
the
teacher
and
pay
her
backpay,
then
we're
going
to
proceed
to
disciplinary
action;
we're
going
to
file
an
administrative
complaint.
the
school
ignored
the
consent
order,
refused
to
show
up
for
a
hearing
that
the
commission
had
scheduled.
and
so
in
dayton,
the
state
filed
an
administrative
complaint,
charging
violations
of
the
ohio
civil
rights
act.
and
those
violations
that
were
charged
were
third-degree
misdemeanors
subject
to
fines,
subject
to
jail
time,
up
to
60
days
in
jail.
so
we
think
that
dayton
gives
some
substance
to
what
is
a
civil
enforcement
action.
it's
the
sort
of
proceeding
where
you
have
an
investigation.
you
have
factual
findings.
you
have
an
administrative
complaint.
you
have
the
possibility
of
civil
penalties
and
potentially,
in
that
case,
there
was
jail
time
as
well.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
yes.
although
the
fcc
is
surprisingly
adept
at
not
resolving
the
issue
in
the
proceedings
that
it
holds
to
resolve
the
issue.
so,
in
fact,
the
fcc
had
a
proceeding
pending
before
it
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
before
the
iub,
in
which
sprint
expected
that
the
--
that
the
fcc
would
resolve
this
issue.
what
the
fcc
did
was
resolve
the
issue
of
what
inter-carrier
compensation
regime
applies
going
forward,
but
it
didn't
address
these
calls
that
have
already
occurred.
so
this
is
a
sort
of
strange
corner
of
telecommunications
law
now.
going
forward,
the
fcc
has
applied
specific
inter-carrier
compensation
regime
under
federal
law
to
this
kind
of
call.
but
going
backwards,
the
appropriate
inter-carrier
compensation
regime
to
apply
under
the
1996
act
under
the
federal
law
is
--
is
still
at
issue.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
we
--
we
strongly
urged
the
iub
not
to
address
these
issues
of
federal
law.
the
iub,
i
think,
was
frustrated
with
the
fcc,
which
had
not
implemented
the
relevant
provisions
of
federal
law,
and
the
iub
reached
out
to
make
decisions
on
federal
law.
and
all
we're
saying
in
this
case
is
that
we
--
we
think
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
challenge
those
decisions
that
the
iub
made
as
to
what's
an
information
service,
what's
a
telecommunications
service.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
to
be
clear,
your
honor,
we
actually
aren't
seeking
to
enjoin
any
proceeding
in
the
state.
we
filed
the
action
in
state
court
because
we
were
required
to
by
eighth
circuit
law.
the
eighth
circuit
has
a
line
of
cases.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
yes,
your
honor.
this
could
--
this
is
a
situation
quite
comparable
to
the
england
case.
in
the
england
case,
the
--
the
federal
court
plaintiffs
thought
that
they
were
required
to
go
to
state
court
with
their
federal
law
issues.
and
this
court
said
that
they
didn't
have
to
go
to
federal
court
--
to
state
court
with
their
federal
law
issues.
and
since
they
did,
they
were
still
entitled
to
reserve
their
federal
law
issues
for
federal
court.
in
our
case,
we
actually
were
required
by
eighth
circuit
precedent
to
go
to
state
court.
the
eighth
circuit
rule
is
that
if
you
don't
go
to
state
court
with
your
federal
law
issues
then
abstention,
younger
abstention
applies
anyway,
even
though
there
is
no
state
proceeding
whatsoever.
so
in
this
case
we
went
to
state
court,
but
only
because
we
had
to
under
eighth
circuit
--
under
the
eighth
circuit's
unusual
law
of
younger
abstention.
when
we
got
to
state
court,
we
tried
to
essentially
do
an
england
reservation.
we
said
to
the
state
court:
we'd
like
to
stay
the
federal
issues
while
they
go
forward
in
federal
court,
because,
of
course,
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
and
a
virtually
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
the
state
court
actually
held
those
issues
in
abeyance
for
2
years
while
the
abstention
issues
were
heard
in
federal
court.
when
the
federal
abstention
issues
were
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit,
incorrectly
we
think,
the
state
court
decided
to
go
forward.
but
our
argument
here
is
that
in
a
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
where
we
have
the
right
to
be
in
federal
court,
to
get
review
of
our
federal
law
issues,
the
fact
that
we
were
forced
by
eighth
circuit
law
to
go
to
state
court
too
shouldn't
preclude
the
federal
court
proceeding
from
going
forward.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
it
would
not
be
the
same,
your
honor,
but
we
do
think
that
we
should--
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
burford
because
the
state
doesn't
argue
that
there's
a
complex
regulatory
regime
here
of
the
sort
that's
covered
by
burford.
what
we
think
is
that
if
this
were
still
before
the
iub,
that
would
really
take
us
back
to
our
main
argument
here
in
this
case.
our
argument
is
that
neither
the
state
court
proceeding
nor
the
iub
proceeding
was
the
kind
of
civil
enforcement
action
to
which
this
court
has
extended
younger.
so
even
if
we'd
filed
in
federal
court
at
the
time
that
proceeding
was
still
pending
before
the
iub,
we
think
that
younger
still
shouldn't
apply.
but
here
there's
an
additional
reason
why
it
shouldn't
apply.
we
waited
for
the
iub
proceeding
to
conclude.
and,
by
the
way,
we
then
paid
the
invoices
that
windstream
wanted
us
to
pay.
there's
--
there's
nothing
further
that
we
could
be
obliged
to
do
here.
we've
already
paid.
but
the
--
but
the
additional
reason
why
we
think
we
would
--
we
should
prevail
here
really
goes
to
the
issue
that
this
court
reserved
in
nopsi.
so
in
nopsi,
the
court
assumed,
without
deciding,
that
the
agency
proceeding
and
the
state
court
review
of
the
agency
proceeding
were
a
unitary
proceeding.
we
think
that
those
proceedings
should
only
be
treated
as
unitary
in
situations
where
the
state
interests
at
the
two
levels
are
similar.
so
in
burford,
to
go
back
to
your
question,
your
honor,
in
burford
the
state
appellate
court
was
participating
in
the
regulatory
process
with
the
state
agency.
and
of
course
this
court
treated
that
as
a
unitary
proceeding.
in
this
case,
the
state
court
proceeding,
as
the
iub
discusses
on
pages
33
and
34
of
its
brief,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
partnership
with
the
--
with
the
agency.
the
relevant
partnership
here,
the
relevant
place
to
review
the
federal
law
issues,
is
federal
court.
the
state's
only
interest
in
the
state
court
proceeding
here
is
a
state
interest
in
state
court
review,
as
opposed
to
federal
court
review,
of
federal
law
issues.
that's
not
the
same
kind
of
interest
that
it
had
at
the
regulatory
proceeding
level.
so,
our
view
here
is
that
issue
in
nopsi
of
--
you
know,
is
the
state
interest
for
purposes
of
younger
the
interest
at
the
agency
level
or
is
there
a
separate
interest
when
it
comes
to
state
judicial
review
of
state
agency
action
and
federal
judicial
review
of
state
agency
action,
we
think
that
that
should
be
resolved
in
our
favor.
so
that's
a--
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
--yes.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
i
can
do
my
best.
it's
somewhat
complicated.
we
went
to
the
agency
with
an
issue
of
state
law.
we
went
to
the
agency
to
ask
the
agency
to
hold
that
windstream
was
not
entitled
to
stop
connecting
our
calls
to
its
customers
without
iub
approval
under
iowa's
consumer
protection
rules.
so
that's
the
issue
that
we
took
to
the
state
agency.
when
we
got
to
the
state
agency,
windstream
said:
oh,
no,
no,
no,
we
are
not
going
to
really
stop
connecting
your
calls
to
our
customers,
because
that's
a
big
no-no
in
the
telecommunications
world.
you
are
not
supposed
to
stop
connecting
calls.
so
that
dispute
went
away.
what
the
iub
did
was
it
reached
out
to
decide
a
different
set
of
issues,
the
underlying
question
of
what
intercarrier
compensation
regime
should
apply
to
these
calls.
so
at
that
point,
the
iub's
theory
now
is
when
they
reached
out
to
decide
these
federal
issues
under
the
1996
act
--
you
know,
what's
an
information
service,
what's
a
telecommunication
service,
what
intercarrier
compensation
regime
applies
here
--
when
they
reached
out
to
decide
those
federal
issues
they
say
this
case
became
a
civil
enforcement
performance
proceeding.
but
this
takes
me
back
to
my
description
of
dayton.
dayton
was
a
civil
enforcement
proceeding.
there
was
an
investigation
there.
there
was
a
finding
of
violations
of
the
ohio
civil
rights
statute.
there
was
an
administrative
complaint
charging
third
degree
misdemeanors
and
threatening
penalties
and
jail
time.
that
is
the
kind
of
civil
enforcement
proceeding
to
which
this
court
has
applied
younger.
that's
the
kind
of
proceeding
that's
like
a
criminal
case,
that
takes
us
back
to
that
traditional
principle
that
courts,
federal
courts
sitting
in
equity,
don't
intrude
into
state
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
matter,
your
honor.
i
think
that,
again,
the
posture
of
the
case
was
very
different.
there,
you
know,
there
was
--
again,
there
was
an
investigation,
there
was
a
due
process
right
to
a
hearing.
there
was
an
agency
that
was
enforcing
existing
state
law.
here,
the
agency
was
essentially
implementing
federal
law.
the
fcc
hadn't
implemented
these
provisions.
everyone
in
the
industry
was
frustrated.
we
were
frustrated.
we
had
taken
these
issues
to
the
fcc,
you
know,
please
decide
what
intercarrier
compensation
regime
applies
here.
the
fcc
hadn't
done
it.
and
so
the
iub,
quite
understandably,
reached
out
to
decide
those
issues.
but
in
announcing
the
kind
of
intercarrier
compensation
regime
that
ought
to
apply
to
these
calls,
the
iub
wasn't
conducting
an
enforcement
proceeding
against
sprint.
an
interesting
point
here,
i
think,
is
that
the
iub's
position
makes
for
something
very
strange
under
ex
parte
young.
you
know,
agencies
generally
have
the
choice
to
proceed
either
by
rulemaking,
which
they
often
do,
or
by
adjudication.
and
they
can
make
the
exact
same
rules
in
either
way.
under
the
--
under
the
iub's
theory,
if
the
agency
proceeds
by
rulemaking
under
ex
parte
young,
you
can
go
to
federal
court
and
get
an
injunction.
if
the
agency
proceeds
by
adjudication,
making
the
exact
same
rules,
you
can't,
because
there
is
a
unitary
proceeding
up
through
the
state
court
appeals,
and
you
are
stuck
with
that,
and
certiori
review
by
this
court,
of
course.
that
to
me
makes
no
sense
under
ex
parte
young.
the
agency's
decision
to
proceed
by
rulemaking
versus
proceeding
by
adjudication
--
which,
by
the
way,
the
iub
had
in
this
case.
the
iub,
when
the
dispute
disappeared
between
sprint
and
windstream,
the
iub
could
have
said:
we'll
close
that
docket
and
we're
going
to
start
a
rulemaking
to
implement
these
provisions
of
federal
law
that
the
fcc
can't
seem
to
get
around
to
implementing.
in
that
case,
we
would,
of
course,
have
been
entitled
under
ex
parte
younger
--
and
this
is
an
ex
parte
younger
case
--
we
could
have
gone
to
federal
court
and
gotten
an
injunction,
a
declaratory
ruling
and
injunction.
and,
of
course,
it
really
doesn't
make
sense
to
distinguish
whether
that
relief
is
available
on
the
basis
of
what
--
how
the
agency
decides
to
proceed.
i
want
to
go
back
to
a
question
that
came
up
earlier
about
pennzoil
and
juidice
and
how
they
fit
into
this
court's
extension
of
that
traditional
principle
that
--
that
courts
of
equity
shouldn't
intrude
into
state
criminal
proceedings.
juidice
and
pennzoil
are
a
kind
of
unusual
corner
of
younger
abstention
law,
because
they
both
involve
challenges
to
the
processes
that
the
states
use
to
enforce
their
judgments.
so,
in
juidice,
the
federal
plaintiff
was
asking
--
what
challenging
under
--
under
the
due
process
clause
new
york's
contempt
procedures,
sort
of
how
they
went
about
holding
folks
in
contempt.
in
pennzoil,
texaco
was
challenging
the
bond
requirements
to
appeal
in
texas,
but
they
were
both
federal
court
cases
bringing
challenges
to
aspects
of
the
way
--
the
way
that
the
states
enforce
their
judgments.
in
this
case,
sprint
has
no
quarrel
at
all
with
any
aspect
of
iowa
law.
we
followed
iowa
law
to
a
t
and
--
and
filed
the
state
court
appeal
that
the
eighth
circuit
required
us
to
file.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
well,
i
think
this
really
goes
back,
your
honor,
to
the
traditional
principle
that
i
started
with.
the
--
the
basic
idea
of
younger
is
that
federal
courts
sitting
in
equity
don't
intrude
into
state
criminal
proceedings.
that's
a
very
important
traditional
rule
because
that's
where
the
state
police
power
is
really
at
its
zenith,
you
know,
enforcing
state
criminal
law.
we
think
that
the
pennzoil
and
juidice
cases
are
very
similar.
the
--
the
idea
that
a
state
can't
enforce
a
judgment
once
its
courts
have
gone
through
the
process
of
coming
to
judgment
is
--
would
be
very
unsettled.
that's
--
that's
the
kind
of
police
--
you
know,
state
police
power
at
its
absolute
zenith.
now,
all
the
things
that
state
regulatory
agencies
do
are
important,
you
know,
but
--
but,
you
know,
not
every
rule
of
a
state
agency
is
at
that
same
level
of
importance
as
a
state
criminal
court.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
well,
middlesex
county
is
not
criminal,
certainly.
i
call
it
an
administrative
disciplinary
proceeding.
and
i
think
that
the
state's
interests
in
that
kind
of
disciplinary
proceeding
is,
in
fact,
very
similar
to
its
interest
in
a
criminal
case.
in
--
in
middlesex
county
itself,
of
course,
a
lawyer
had
referred
to
a
trial
as
a
kangaroo
court
and
a
legalized
lynching.
and
--
and
the
new
jersey
ethics
committee,
you
know,
said
that
that
was
the
sort
of
conduct
that
--
that
couldn't
be
permitted
under
the
state
bar
rules.
so,
that
is
not
literally
a
criminal
case.
it
is
one
of
this
court's
extensions
of
--
of
the
principle
to
the
civil
enforcement
proceeding
context;
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
motivated
by
very
much
the
same
sorts
of
interests.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
well,
i
think,
again,
your
honor,
that
that
goes
back
to
the
differences
between
this
sort
of
case
and
the
dayton
case.
in
this
case,
what
the
iub
really
was
doing
was
announcing
its
understanding
of
--
of
these
provisions
of
the
federal
act.
in
--
in
a
case
like
dayton
where
this
court
has
applied
younger,
the
--
the
commission
there
was,
you
know,
seeking
to
penal
--
penalize
wrongdoing
by
the
--
by
the
school.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
--
there's
an
important
difference
with
respect
to
that
traditional
principle
that
younger
reflects
of
not
interfering
with
state
criminal
actions.
there's
a
big
difference
between
when
the
state
announces
rules
that
will
be
broadly
applicable
throughout
the
industry
like
here
and
when
the
state
is
actually
seeking
to
punish
wrongdoing,
as
in
dayton
or
as
in
middlesex
county.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
j.
simeone
i
hope
to
be
very
brief.
but
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
problem
with
the
iub's
approach
lacking
sort
of
meaningful
limits.
and
i
just
want
to
say
a
couple
words
about
the
middlesex
county
test,
because
i
don't
think
that
that
lack
of
meaningful
limits
necessarily
follows
from
--
from
the
middlesex
county
test,
although
i
do
think
some
clarification
of
the
test
would
be
--
would
be
helpful.
under
middlesex
county,
of
course,
younger
requires
an
ongoing
state
judicial
proceeding
and
it
requires
an
important
state
interest.
so
with
respect
to
ongoing
state
judicial
proceeding,
the
iub
understands
‵‵
judicial
′′
to
be
any
adjudicative
proceeding.
but
as
we
argue
in
our
briefs,
that's
not
necessarily
consistent
with
the
rest
of
this
court's
cases
under
--
applying
younger.
‵‵
judicial
′′
we
think
means
an
exercise
of
the
state's
judicial
enforcement
authority.
so,
limiting
that
prong
of
middlesex
county
to
an
exercise
of
the
state's
judicial
enforcement
authority
would
help
to
draw
this
line.
a
second
similar
point
is
with
respect
to
the
state
interest
prong
of
middlesex
county,
we
argue,
of
course,
that
the
relevant
state
interest
is
the
state's
interest
in
the
ongoing
state
proceeding.
here
the
ongoing
state
proceeding
was
this
--
was
judicial
review
of
the
agency
proceeding.
so,
by
--
by
limiting
the
proceeding
that
you're
looking
at
to
the
ongoing
state
judicial
proceeding
required
by
the
first
prong
of
middlesex
county,
then
you're
really
just
looking
at
the
state's
interest
in
state
judicial
review
of
federal
law
questions
as
opposed
to
federal
court
judicial
review
of
--
of
federal
law
questions.
and
again,
that
seems
to
me
to
help
to
draw
a
line.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
was
all
i
had.
