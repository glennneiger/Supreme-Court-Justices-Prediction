justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
simeone,
this
--
the
background
of
this
case,
i
don't
quite
grasp.
you
originally
said
that
you
wanted
to
make
sure
you
--
there
was
no
disconnection
pending
the
fcc's
resolution
of
the
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
the
fcc
had
a
proceeding
to
resolve
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
wouldn't
--
let's
say
you
--
you
--
there
were
no
abstention.
you
have
your
case
in
federal
court.
and
the
federal
judge
says,
the
fcc
hasn't
spoken,
so
i
don't
want
to
step
out
in
front
of
the
fcc
on
this
on
this
--
on
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
could.
you
could
challenge
it
in
the
state
court
or
this
court
and
--
eventually.
but
there's
a
proceeding
going
on
in
the
state
court,
and
there's
a
review
--
state
review
attached
to
that.
and
you're
--
you're
saying
we
can
cut
off
this
administrative
process
that
ends
in
state
review.
we
could
cut
it
off
and
go
to
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
explained
that.
but
--
but
in
the
review
--
in
your
review
petition
from
the
state
court
--
to
the
state
court,
you
brought
up
more
than
just
this
--
the
question
of
these
--
these
charges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
say
about
the
argument
that
--
that
once
the
iub
decided
to
go
on
with
this
proceeding,
you
didn't
want
them
to,
but
they
did,
that
that
then
became
a
proceeding
for
them
to
enforce
the
access
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
then
that
in
every
state
agency
adjudication
attended
by
state
court
review
--
yeah,
that
would
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
can
you
--
so
can
you
then
--
we
have
only
the
two
cases.
we
have
middlesex
and
dayton,
and
you
say
this
case
belongs
in
that
younger
category.
what
state
court
adjudication,
state
agency
adjudications
attended
by
state
court
review,
would
fall
outside
younger,
your
rationale
of
what
younger
covers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
why
wouldn't
you
say
that
sprint
was
not
the
initiator
of
this
state
process?
because
sprint
withdrew
its
complaint,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sprint
--
sprint
withdrew
its
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
so
at
that
point
it
becomes
the
board's
proceeding.
it
becomes
a
proceeding
initiated
by
the
board
and
not
by
sprint.
