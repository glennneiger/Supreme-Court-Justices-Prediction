chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
next
hear
argument
in
case
12-815,
sprint
communications
v.
jacobs.
mr.
simeone.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lynch?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
but
i
mean,
is
there
a
different
category,
some
of
the
normal
regulatory
interests
are
important
and
other
regulatory
interests
are
not?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
line
that
younger
drew,
or
that
i
thought
it
was
drawing,
between
criminal
and
civil
has
been
eroded
to
a
considerable
extent.
but
your
friend
analogized
that
in
other
cases,
for
want
of
a
better
word,
to
--
they're
sort
of
quasi-criminal
or
at
least
touching
upon
the
process
as
opposed
to
a
particular
proceeding.
i
mean,
do
you
think
that
the
abstention
applies
in
the
case
of
every
regulatory
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
tell
which--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
it's
going
to
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
don't
all
--
it's
sort
of
like
the
important
state
interests.
i
assume
the
state's
not
doing
anything
unless
they
think
it's
important.
and
any
type
of
administrative
proceeding,
remedial
or
otherwise,
has
to
a
have
some
bite
to
it.
there
has
to
be
something
that
is
going
happen
to
you
if
you
don't
do
what
they
tell
you
to
do.
so
in
that
sense,
i
mean,
almost
every
administrative
proceeding
is
coercive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
it
doesn't
seem
like
much
of
a
limiting
test,
if
you
can
say
any
time
--
sort
of
any
time
anything
bad
can
happen
to
you
as
a
result
of
an
administrative
proceeding,
that's
coercive.
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
serious
constraint
on
the
application
of
younger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
--
i'm
sorry.
i
was
just
going
to
say
why
is
that?
presumably,
the
state
is
resolving
that
dispute
pursuant
to
some
state
law
or
state
regulation,
state
policy.
i
don't
know
why
the
--
the
state
interest
is
unimportant
simply
because
it's
the
resolution
of
a
private
dispute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
mr.
simeone,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
