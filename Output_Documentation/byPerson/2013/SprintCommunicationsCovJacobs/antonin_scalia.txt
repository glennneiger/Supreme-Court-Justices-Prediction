when
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
especially
in
cases
that
involve
jurisdictional
issues.
it
seems
an
awfully
--
awful
waste
of
counsel's
time
and
client's
money
to
be
litigating
about
which
court
you
ought
to
be
in,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
avoid
that,
the
lines
ought
to
be
clear.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
line,
you
know,
whether
there
is
a
significant
state
interest
involved
or
not,
is
a
clear
line.
you
can
argue
about
that
in
almost
any
case.
so
i'm
disinclined
to
use
that
kind
of
a
--
of
a
test
along
with
any
others.
why
can't
we
just
limit
--
limit
younger
abstention
to
the
three
categories
discussed
in
nopsi,
and
say,
that's
it;
no
more?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
purely
civil
case
that
raises
that
kind
of
an
issue
can
arguably
be
subject
to
younger
abstention;
is
that
right?
