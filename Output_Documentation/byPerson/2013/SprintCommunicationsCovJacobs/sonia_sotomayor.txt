justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
one
of
the
problems
i
have
is
i
don't
know
how
to
define
‵‵
coercive
′′.
the
line
seems
very
hard
to
draw.
there
are
plenty
of
examples
in
the
brief
where
some
courts
have
said
this
kind
of
proceeding
is
coercive
and
that
kind
is
not.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
it
--
is
it
worthwhile
using
that
distinction
at
all,
or
should
we
be
thinking
about
going
back
to
basic
principles
and
doing
something
like
the
second
circuit
does,
which
is
to
say
it's
a
sovereign
interest
rather
than
a
personal
interest?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
those
were
when
most
of
them
involved
state
proceedings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
then
we
went
further
in
pennzoil
and
in
new
orleans
--
well,
perhaps
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
what's
left
of
colorado
river
under
your
view
of
this
case?
i
mean,
in
colorado
river,
we
made
it
very
clear
that
abstention
should
be
the
exception.
i
always
thought
that
was
a
driving
principle,
which
federal
law
should
be
announced
by
federal
courts.
if
we
take
the
eighth
circuit
rule
where
everything
is
unitary
and
required
and
your
rule
that
any
time
it
involves
a
state
agency
essentially,
it's
subject
to
abstention,
what's
left
of
federal
courts
having
any
jurisdiction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
eighth
circuit
has
decided
that
question.
you're
right.
we
didn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
say
it
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
why
don't
you
get
to
the
essence
of
that
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
the
state
law
here?
they
were
interpreting
federal
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
mimics
the
federal
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
don't
derive
any
power
independent
of
that
federal
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
the
way,
there
are
other
abstention
doctrines
that
can
take
care
of
state
interests,
aren't
there?
there's
burford.
there
are
many
others.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
don't
know
why
younger
as
you're
--
in
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
why
younger
has
to
be
the
only
vehicle,
why
we
need
to
create
more
categories
than
nopsi
did
to
protect
state
interests
when
we
have
an
awful
lot
of
other
doctrines
that
do
that
already.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
the
way,
have
we
ever
used
the
younger
abstention
in
a
case
where
the
federal
plaintiff
also
filed
the
federal
--
the
state
action
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
before
anybody,
court
or
a
board.
