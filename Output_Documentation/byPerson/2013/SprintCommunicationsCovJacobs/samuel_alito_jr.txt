justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
dayton,
if
the
only
relief
available
had
been
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
would
that
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
those
cases
are
different.
but
why
is
there
a
--
why
is
there
a
greater
federalism
concern
in
those
cases
than
in
this
case
where
the
iub
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
how
much
citizens
of
iowa
pay
for
a
telephone
service?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
then,
if
the
question
is
whether
something
is
tied
to
something
that
can
be
regarded
as
criminal
or
quasi-criminal,
what
about
middlesex
county?
that's
not
criminal.
or
is
not
criminal.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
state
administrative
proceedings
that
would
not
fall
within
your
understanding
of
the
scope
of
younger?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
it's
a
licensing
procedure.
somebody's
been
denied
a
license
to
be
a
barber
or
a
hairdresser
and
the
person
wants
to
challenge
that
in
federal
court.
would
younger
apply
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
there's
some
--
there's
an
--
an
administrative
agency
in
the
state
that
hears
appeals
from
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
correct
that
under
eighth
circuit
law
the
party
that
wants
to
bring
the
federal
lawsuit
has
to
go
to
state
court
first?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
--
i
thought
that
sprint
said
that
they
had
to
go
to
state
court
whether
they
wanted
to
or
not
or
else
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
go
to
federal
court.
