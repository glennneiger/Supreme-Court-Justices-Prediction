justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
matter
if
it's
just
purely
federal
law?
i
mean,
think
of
a
civil
case
involving
a
state
on
one
side
and
private
parties
on
another
in
a
state
court
which
has
jurisdiction
over
federal
laws.
the
state
claims
that
the
defendant
has
violated,
civilly,
a
federal
statute.
there's
an
action
also
in
federal
court.
in
your
view,
does
the
federal
court
have
to
abstain?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there's
no
action
for
an
injunction.
what
they
want
is
the
judge
to
decide
the
case.
the
private
party
wants
the
federal
judge
to
decide
his
case.
that's
all.
it's
a
matter
of
interpreting
federal
law.
now,
in
your
opinion,
is
younger
--
does
younger,
not
some
other
doctrine,
does
younger
require
abstention?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
so
on
your
review,
we
can
never
have
a
case
proceed
in
federal
court
even
on
a
purely
federal
issue
if,
in
fact,
there
is
involving
this
estate
civil
case
on
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
can't
think
of
a
--
doesn't
it
often
happen
that
there
are
such
cases?
i
mean,
i
--
i
would
think
that
wouldn't
be
too
difficult.
i
mean,
either
there
never
is
one
and
you
tend
to
be
right
or
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
them
and
you
tend
to
be
wrong.
i've
just
never
heard
it
put
in
that
extreme
way,
and
maybe
you're
right.
i
don't
know.
what's
your
--
do
you
have
authority
for
it
or
any
light
to
shed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
younger
say
‵‵
before
′′?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
younger
say
‵‵
before
′′?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
said
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
--
so
in
your
view,
it
doesn't
matter
which
is
brought
first,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
younger
only
applies
to
--
to
state
proceedings
that
are
brought
first,
then
i
guess
we
could
have
a
--
a
criminal
defendant,
who's
not
yet
one,
bring
an
action
in
federal
court
to
say
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
or
something
or
violates
a
federal
law.
and
then
the
state
prosecutes
him
criminally
and
the
federal
court
couldn't
--
and
the
federal
court
could
enjoin
the
criminal
proceeding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we've
said
they
can't
--
you
can
enjoin
a
criminal
decision
--
a
criminal
proceeding
in
a
state
court
as
long
as
the
criminal
proceeding
wasn't
brought
first.
is
that
what
this
court
has
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there
is
a
pending
one
by
the
time
they
get
around
to
it.
then
what?
i
mean,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'll
ask
you
to
clarify.
you've
come
up
with
a
couple
of
rules
that
strike
me
as
counterintuitive
and
so
i'm
trying
to
figure
that
one
out.
the
before
or
after
one
doesn't
seem
to
work
too
well
in
my
mind,
because
it
would
seem,
you
know,
you
couldn't
--
federal
court
couldn't.
federal
court
could
enjoin
a
criminal
proceeding
that
came
up
later
in
your
view,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
