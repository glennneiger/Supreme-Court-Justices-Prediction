mr.
simeone?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
take
you
back
to
--
to
the
agency
proceeding?
so
i
guess
i
understood
from
your
respective
briefs
that
you
say
the
agency
proceeding
was
not
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
the
agency
says
it
was
an
enforcement
proceeding
because
you
might
have
brought
it
initially,
but
you
tried
to
get
out,
and
then
the
agency
compelled
you
to
keep
on
going
in
its
process.
so
could
you
explain
that
to
me?
justice

kagan
i
think--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
guess,
mr.
lynch,
the
concern
is,
given
that
we
think
agencies
are
doing
things
that
implicate
important
state
interests
most
of
the
time,
that's
why
they
do
them,
that
--
that
your
test,
and
not
just
your
test,
but
the
eighth
circuit's
tests,
would
turn
agency
adjudicators
into
the
primary
legal
decision-makers
in
our
system
on
all
matters
that
they
were
--
you
know,
wanted
to
get
into,
including
matters
of
federal
law.
justice
elena
kagan
that
does
seem
like
a
big
proposition,
you
know.
i
mean,
do
you
think
that
younger
says
that
or
that
middlesex
says
that
or
that
we've
ever
said
that?
