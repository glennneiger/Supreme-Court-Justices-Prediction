mr.
david
j.
lynch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
sprint's
proposed
test,
after
sprint
chose
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
iowa
utilities
board,
windstream
could
have
gone
to
federal
court
at
any
time
to
enjoin
the
board
proceedings.
because
under
sprint's
test,
the
board
proceedings
were
remedial
and
the
--
younger
abstention
was
not
applicable
to
those
proceedings.
that's
true
despite
the
fact
that
at
that
time,
when
the
petition
was
filed,
the
board
was
faced
with
a
compelling
state
interest;
that
is,
an
immediate
and
direct
threat
to
public
health
and
welfare.
if
windstream
had
been
able
to
go
to
the
federal
court
and
interrupt
the
state
proceedings
at
that
moment,
that
very
act
would
unavoidably
cast
dispersions
on
the
state's
ability
to
resolve
the
federal
issues
here
in
the
context
of
that
important
state
interest,
and
that
is
precisely
one
of
the
evils
that
younger
abstention
is
directed
to.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
the
--
let
me
give
you
two
parts
to
that
answer.
first
of
all,
that
--
we
believe
that
it
applies
when
the
agency
proceedings
are
engaged
in
enforcement
of
a
state
statute,
state
law.
that
that's
kind
of
the
touchstone
for
when
you're
more
likely
to
see
an
important
state
interest.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i've
got
to
take
this
case
and
make
two
changes
to
it,
and
i
have
an
example
for
you.
instead
of
having
sprint
in
the
position
of
saying
that
the
access
--
intrastate
access
charge
tariff
does
not
apply
at
all,
imagine
that
the
dispute
between
sprint
and
windstream
was
over
merely
the
calculation
of
the
amounts,
over
un
--
over
ambiguous
language
within
that
tariff.
and
because
sprint
admitted
that
the
tariff
applied,
whatever
it
meant,
there
would
be
no
threat
of
disconnection.
under
those
circumstances,
you
truly
do
have
the
garden
variety
commercial
dispute
between
two
parties
that
sprint
tries
to
characterize
this
case
as.
but
this
case
involved
more.
this
case
involved
the
filed
tariff
doctrine,
a
statutory
provision
the
court's
familiar
with,
that
the
board
is
charged
with
enforcing.
this
board,
at
least
initially
--
or
excuse
me
--
this
case
also
involved,
initially,
that
threat
of
disconnection,
which
added
an
element
of
exigency
to
the
board's
action
that
is
not
present
in
most
of
these
cases.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
unitary
proceeding
or
whether
there's
a
--
a
fork
in
the
road
after
the
agency
has
completed
its
proceedings,
that
question
is
not
part
of
the
question
presented
here
in
this
case
today.
the
court
does
not
need
to
reach
that
question.
it
can
do
as
it
did
in
new
orleans
public
service
and
simply
assume
that
it
is
a
case
of
the
unitary
requirement
without
deciding
it.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
there's--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--there
is,
in
fact,
under
our
research,
about
a
4-3
split
among
the
circuits
on
that
question.
the
parties
haven't
really
briefed
it.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
and
if
you're
going
to
get
to
that
question,
in
fact--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--thank
you.
then
what's
left
of
the
colorado
river
case
is
what
it
has
always
been
there,
which
is
when
the
--
there
is
not
an
important
state
interest,
younger
abstention
does
not
apply.
and
that
is
always
the
touchstone
of
this
analysis.
you
know,
the
three
middlesex
county
factors,
the
first
one's
easy:
is
there
a
pending
state
proceeding
or
not?
that's
always
--
either
its
there
or
it
isn't.
that's
not
a
problem.
in
much
that
way,
when
sprint
chose
to
come
to
the
iowa
utilities
board,
it
could
have
gone
to
federal
court
instead,
i
assume.
i
chose
to
come
to
the
board
for
relief
even
though
it
says
that
the
issues
involved
federal
law.
the
third
factor
in
middlesex
county,
the
ability
of
the
courts,
the
state
courts,
through
a
state
process
to
address
the
federal
questions,
also
typically
not
an
issue
in
this
type
of
proceeding.
there
is
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
state
courts
and
that
is
going
to
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
sprint
has
not
challenged
that
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
the
--
because
it
would,
if
you
were
to
take
that
approach,
it
would
result
in
a
denial
of
abstention
in
cases
like
this
one
that
present
exactly
the
evils,
the
concerns
that
were
presented
in
younger
in
terms
of
disrespect
for
the
state's
ability
to
resolve
federal
questions,
the
concerns
of
federalism,
the
concerns
of
avoiding
duplicative
cases
in
the
courts.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
it
would
be
up
to
the
judges
to
decide
whether
there
was
an
important
state
interest
there
or
not.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
a
state
agency
adjudication
that
did
not
involve
the
state
agency
attempting
to
enforce
a
state
statute
or
state
law.
and
that's,
as
i
tried
to
describe
in
my
earlier
example,
if
that
would
be
the
case
here,
if
the
dispute
between
sprint
and
windstream
had
been
something
other
than
does
the--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--the
state
law
here
was
iowa
code
section
476.5,
the
filed
tariff
doctrine,
which
requires
that,
in
this
case,
that
windstream
charge
sprint
with
providing
intrastate
access
services.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
on
the
state
side.
that's
--
it's
our
version
of
that
federal
law,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
oh,
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
this
is
an
independent
state
statute.
it
is
not
--
it
is
analogous
to
the
federal
interstate
filed
tariff
doctrine,
but
it
is
not
dependent
upon
it
at
all.
it's
existed
for
i
don't
know
how
many
years.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
in
appropriate
cases,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i
don't
know
that
we're
asking
you
to
create
a
new
category
or
a
new
extension.
we
felt
that
this
case
fit
very
clearly
within
the
middlesex
test
under
younger
abstention.
and
it
was
a
straightforward
application
of
that
three-part
test,
and
obviously
a
district
court
judge
agreed.
it
was
not
--
it
does
not
require
any
extension
of
younger
to
apply
that
principle
to
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
do
you
mean
the
state
action
before
the
board
or
before--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
no.
but
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point,
which
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
to
apply
the
coercive-remedial
distinction
as
a
test
in
this
case,
the
results
before
the
eighth
circuit
should
still
be
affirmed
because
the
board
proceedings
were
in
fact
coercive.
as
has
already
been
alluded
to
here
today,
after
sprint
filed
its
petition
with
the
board,
windstream
came
back
and
said,
in
essence:
we
will
not
disconnect
sprint
as
long
as
they
pay
the
access
charges
going
forward.
they
can
hold
the
money
going
back.
we
won't
disconnect
them
as
long
as
they
pay
going
forward.
sprint
came
back
and
said:
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
going
forward,
but
we've
got
--
you're
not
going
to
disconnect
us.
we've
got
what
we
want.
we
want
to
withdraw
our
petition.
and
at
that
point
the
board
said:
that's
fine;
you
can
take
your
petition,
but
don't
go
anywhere.
stay
here.
we're
going
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this,
because
if
we
let
you
go
it's
going
to
recur.
this--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--reoccur.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
the
case
would
inevitably
be
before
the
board
again,
perhaps
next
time
with
sprint
--
with
windstream
filing
instead
of
sprint
or
sprint
saying
they're
threatening
us
with
disconnection
again.
there
was
no
point
in
letting
it
start
over.
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
to
see
what
was
going
on.
the
lower
courts
have
identified
various
--
this
goes
to
your
earlier
question,
justice
sotomayor,
about
how
to
define
coercive
proceedings.
and
the
lower
courts
have
identified
a
number
of
factors
that
they've
considered
in
this,
including
who
initiated
the
proceeding,
was
participation
in
the
proceeding
mandatory,
does
the
federal
court
contend
that
the
state
proceeding
is
unlawful,
or
do
they
--
does
the
federal
plaintiff
instead
seek
a
remedy
from
some
other
state-initiated
inflicted
wrong,
is
the
federal
plaintiff
alleged
to
have
committed
a
bad
act,
and
finally
whether
the
proceeding
involved
the
state's
enforcement
of
its
laws.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
if
it
can
be
backed
up,
as
this
one
could.
when
the
board
issued
its
order
and
directed
sprint
to
make
payment
to
windstream,
had
sprint
failed
to
do
that
sprint
could
have
been
subject
to
civil
penalties
assessed
by
the
board.
so
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
agency
proceedings
are
backed
up
with
that
kind
of
enforcement--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--and
what
that,
what
that
may
go
to,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
the
coercive-remedial
distinction
is
not
any
easier
to
apply
than
the
important
state
interest
test.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
with
respect
to
my
own
agency,
for
instance,
a
--
well,
there
is
all
the
obvious
examples,
legislative
action,
the
cases
where
there
is
no
state
agency
or
no
state
proceeding
pending.
but
in
terms
of
a
quasi-judicial
agency
action
that
would
not
be
entitled
to
younger
abstention,
given
the
earlier
example
if
the
parties
were
in
what's
called
the
garden
--
truly
in
a
garden-variety
commercial
dispute
between
two
parties
and
the
agency
is
simply
resolving
that
dispute
between
the
two
parties.
the
state's
interest
is
substantially
diminished
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
let
me
be
clear.
i
don't
say
the
state
interest
is
unimportant;
it
is
simply
diminished.
and
at
some
point,
it
would
be
diminished
to
the
point
where
younger
abstention
would
not
be
appropriate.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
if
the
federal
plaintiff
brought
the
federal
action
in
order
to
enjoin
the
state
court
proceedings--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
involving
the
same
parties.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
yeah.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i
think
my
authority
for
it
is
in
this
case
--
in
this
court's
younger
abstention
decisions.
the
middlesex
county
test
is
a
simple
three-part
test
that
focuses
always
on
the
second
factor:
what
is
the
state's
interest?
what
is
the
important
state
interest?
mr.
david
j.
lynch
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--i
don't
believe
that
would
be
agency
action
in
a
judicial
manner.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i'm
assuming
that
they
filed
a
--
a
form,
filled
it
out,
gave
it
to
the
agency
and
it
was
denied.
that
seems
more
to
me
to
be
of
an
executive
character.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
if
the
person
applying
for
that
license
had
then
gone
on
to
ask
for
a
hearing
before
that
department
that
hears
administrative
appeals,
and
it
had
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
in
order
to
make
that
determination,
then
i
believe
that
younger
would
--
could
apply
there,
if
there's
an
important
state
interest
attached
to
the
denial
of
that
license.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
that
would
--
to
the
extent
that
the
cases
are
brought
before
the
state
agencies
in
the
first
place,
and
the
federal
issues
are
raised
there,
before
it
goes
to
the
federal
court,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i
think
that
middlesex
combined
with
huffman
providing
for
the
state
a
unitary
proceeding
does,
in
fact,
provide
for
that
result.
leads
logic--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
j.
lynch
no.
middlesex--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--middlesex--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--no.
middlesex
county
requires
that
there
be
a
pending
state
proceeding.
there
is
one
other
argument
i'd
like
to
address--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--you
mean
following
the
agency
proceedings,
the
unitary
proceeding?
that
is
the
eighth
circuit's
approach,
yes.
that
once
you've
gotten
on
the
--
the
state
train,
you
have
to
ride
that
through
to
the
end
of
the
state
process.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i
believe
sprint's
argument
--
i
don't
care
--
don't
want
to
speak
for
them,
but
i
believe
their
argument
on
that
point
was
following
the
board's
decision,
they
feel
that
the
eighth
circuit
law
required
them
to
file
petitions
in
both
federal
court
and
to
invoke
the
judicial
review
process
in
state
district
court.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
that
would
be
the
--
very
much
like
the
case
in
this
court's
decision
in
steffel
against--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--as
i
read
it
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
there's
no
younger
abstention
when
there's
no
pending
state
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
so
--
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
yes.
i
think
the
federal
court
at
least
could
answer
the
federal
question
presented.
i
guess
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing--
mr.
david
j.
lynch
--okay.
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
address
is
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion,
particularly
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs,
to
the
effect
that
the
board
was
acting
under
federally
delegated
authority
here
under
some
--
as
some
kind
of
deputized
federal
agent.
that
is
not
the
case
at
all
here.
the
board
was
acting
under
its
state
law
authority.
sprint
relies,
for
instance,
on
the
at&t
vs.
iowa
utilities
board
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
1996
telecommunications
act
asserted
federal
authority
to
regulate
local
telecommunications
matters.
that's
true
insofar
as
it
goes,
but
that
case
is
limited
to
matters
addressed
by
the
'96
act,
which
was
addressed
to
create
in
competition
within
the
local
exchange
marketplace.
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
access
services
by
which
a
long
distance
carrier
such
as
sprint
delivers
a
long
distance
call
to
the
local
exchange
carrier
such
as
windstream
for
completion
to
windstream's
customers.
that
service
remains
practically
a
monopoly
service.
sprint
has
no
way
to
get
those
calls
to
windstream's
customers
other
than
by
connecting
it
to
windstream
and
letting
windstream
--
compensating
windstream
for
carrying
those
calls
to
the
end.
because
of
that,
the
federal
telecommunications
act
of
'96
in
section
251(g)
expressly
reserved
the
tariff
access
charge
regime
and
did
not
affect
the
state's
jurisdiction
over
intrastate
access
charges.
sprint
acknowledges
that
in
its
reply
brief
at
pages
22
and
23,
but
claims
that
the
situation
is
unclear
as
to
what
applied
between
1996
and
2011.
but
the
fact
remains
that
sprint
paid
those
intrastate
access
charges
without
protest
from
1996
to
2009,
when
it
made
the
unilateral
decision
to
change
the
process
and
start
withholding
those
payments.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
a
few
words
there.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
sprint
was
allowed
to
withdraw
its
complaint.
mr.
david
j.
lynch
that
is
correct.
thus,
even
under
the
first-to-file
test,
we
believe
that
this
case
was
coercive
at
the
time
it
was
before
the
board
to
the
extent
that
the
coercive-remedial
distinction
matters.
those
are
the
points
i
had
to
cover.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
