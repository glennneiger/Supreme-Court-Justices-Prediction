mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
suggest
that
the
future
of
medical
care,
both
in
its
delivery
and
in
its
regulation,
are
in
some
way
implicated
by
the
court's
decision
today.
the
health
care
plan
involved
here
is
a
standard
health
care
plan
within
the
employee
benefits
plan
under
erisa.
carle
offers
vanilla,
plain
vanilla
managed
care
operations.
as
judge
easterbrook
said
in
his
denial
of
rehearing,
that
if
carle's
set-up
violates
erisa,
then
all
managed
care
does
so
as
well.
accordingly,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
needs
to
have
that
kind
of
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
managed
care
industry
in
this
particular
context,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
because
there
is
a
perfectly
available
and
valid
remedy
for
the
people
in
ms.
herdrich's
position,
and
that
is
medical
malpractice
law.
she
had--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
this
very
case,
justice
o'connor,
she...
the
defendants
were
found
liable,
and
she
received
35,000
as
full
compensation
for
her...
for
the
injuries
that
she
suffered.
there's
no
question,
based
on
that
determination,
that
there's
been
an
error
in
judgment
and
that
it
fell
below
the
standards
of
care
for
medical
malpractice
purposes,
and
that
there
are
available
perfectly
valid
remedies
under
state
law
to
her.
the
question
then
is,
is
there
some
reason
to
add
over
those
perfectly
complete
remedies
under
state
law
an
erisa
remedy
as
well,
and
while
i
think
that
question
can
be
posed
out
of
narrowly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
absolutely
true,
justice
scalia.
the
question...
does
congress
intend
for--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
right.
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
add
erisa
over
and
above
the
malpractice
law,
and
i
think
it's
important
in
making
that
determination
to
realize
that
this
is
essentially
a
zero-sum
situation.
that
is,
to
the
extent
you
expand
federal
law
under
erisa,
the
more
you
have
to
narrow
state
law
because
of
the
erisa
preemption
provision
under
section
514(a).
that
says
that
every
matter
that
is
within
plan
administration,
everything
that
relates
to
an
erisa
plan,
right,
and
therefore
is
protected
under
federal
law,
preempts
all
state
law
that's
related
to
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
under
those
circumstances
that
the
court
should
be
quite
loath
to
expansively
interpret
erisa,
and
certainly
there's
very
little
evidence
that
congress
meant
to
do
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
actually
judge
easterbrook,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below,
had
the
better
of
that
argument,
and
he
argued,
and
i
think
quite
rightly,
that
the
allegations
in
the
respondent's
complaint
basically
lay
out
the
kinds
of
incentives
that
are
inherent
in
any
managed
care
operation
in
terms
of
questions
of
medical
necessity,
experimental
treatment...
all
of
the
elements
that
go
into
trying
to
control
what
was
in
the
1980's
an
extraordinarily
expensive
health
care
system
are
embodied
in
the
carle
clinic's
managed
care
plan,
so
in
that
sense
i
don't
think
it
is
significantly
different
from
any
other
managed
care
operation,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
know.
maybe
you
should
ask
him
that
question.
my
understanding
is,
first
she's
made
no
claim
for
damages
under
erisa,
and
for
good
reason.
there
are
none
available.
there
are
no
benefits
that
she
has
not
been
provided
under
any
plan,
however
you
want
to
define
it,
and
so
there's
no
basis
for
recovery
there.
she
seeks
no
injunctive
relief,
so
i
don't
know
that,
and
indeed
the
amended
count
iii
focuses
on
some
kind
of
a
treatment
with
respect
to
a
pot
of
money
when...
and
with
respect
to
a
plan
that
simply
doesn't
exist,
so
i
have
no
idea
what
it
is
that
respondent
thinks
that
she
will
gain
from
this,
except
perhaps
attorney's
fees.
obviously
there
is
a
provision
for
attorney's
fees
under
erisa,
but
in
terms
of
her
own
stake
in
this,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
quite
ephemeral,
and...
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
no.
i
don't
contend
there
isn't
a
live
case.
what
i
do
contend
is
that
it's...
you
know,
if
you
go
down
this
path,
at
the
end
of
the
process
you're
going
to
be
hard-pressed
to
come
up
with
much
of
a
remedy
that's
going
to
make
any
difference
to
her
at
this
stage
in
the
process.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
she
is...
i
mean,
what
she
is
seeking--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
a
judgment
with--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
no,
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia,
but
what
she
is
seeking
is...
i
mean,
her
claim
is
that
there
is
a
pot
of
money
and
that
that
pot
of
money
can
be
moved
around.
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
that
logically
in
terms
of
how
this
scheme
works
out,
but
that's
not
a
basis
to
claim
there's
no
jurisdiction.
that's
simply
a
basis
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question
which
is,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
when
it's
all
said
and
done,
if
she
got
everything
she
wanted
out
of
this,
what's
likely
to
come
out
of
it?
my
sense
is
there
isn't
much
but,
again,
respondent
may
be
in
a
better
position
to
analyze
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
that
would
be
certainly
the
case
under
the
narrower
of...
narrowest
of
the
theories
that
we
put
forward
in
opposition
to
the
judgment
below.
we
do
have
one
theory
in
this
case
regarding
the
scope
of
the
definition
of
the
term,
plan.
under
that,
i'm
not
sure
there
would
be
any
circumstances
where
the
hmo
would
be...
have
fiduciary
responsibilities,
but
under
our
narrower
interpretation
we
don't
really
disagree
with
the
united
states
that
if,
in
fact,
you're
talking
about
an
hmo
that's
making
coverage
or
claim
determinations
wholly
apart
from
medical
treatment
decisions,
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
in
a
second,
it
could
potentially
be
a
situation
where
there
would
be
some
potential
fiduciary
responsibility,
but
then
that
raises
a
whole
slew
of
questions
with
respect
to
what
kinds
of
incentive
plans,
or
incentive
arrangements
might
breach
that
fiduciary
duty
and
the
issues
that
stem
from
that
inquiry,
none
of
which,
i
submit
to
you,
is
posed
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
as
it's
defended
before
this
court
with
respect
to
coverage
allegations.
if
you
look
at
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
9,
she
could
not
be
clearer
in
arguing
that
the
exclusive
focus
of
the
case
is...
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
the
language
here.
the
sole
focus
of
attention
of
amended
count
iii,
which
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
it's
on
page
9
of
the
blue
brief.
i
mean,
of
the
red
brief.
i
apologize.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
sort
of
in
the
middle,
as
i
recall.
i'm
sorry,
the
last
sentence
of
the
second
full
paragraph--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i'll
just
quote
it.
the
sole
focus
of
attention
of
amended
count
iii
is
the
design
and
administration
of
an
undisclosed
physician
incentive
to
withhold
treatment.
i
think
the
only
fair
way
to
interpret
that
language
is
to
say
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
basically
the
provision
of
care,
the
provision
of
medical
care
and
the
methods
of
compensation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
you
have
to
read
that
in
context,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
we
certainly
conceded
it
for
purposes
of
the
disclosure
issues
and
the
bad
faith
claims
that
were
the
basis
for
the
remand
order,
or
the
remand
issue
in
that
context.
we
have
never
conceded
that
we
were
a
fiduciary
for
purposes
of
the
amended
count
iii
complaint.
we
have
consistently
argued
that
we
have
no
fiduciary
responsibilities
with
respect
to
claims
in
count
iii,
and
in
any
event,
even
if
the
respondent's
memory
lasted
long
enough
to
sort
of
have
that
uppermost
in
her
mind
at
the
time
she
filed
her
brief
in
this
court,
we
had
clearly
laid
out
our
theory
of
this
case,
which
is
that
we
are
not
a
fiduciary
for
these
purposes.
her
defense
of
the
judgment
below
is
very
focused,
and
i
think
it
spares
the
court
a
significant
amount
of
time
and
energy
having
to
sort
out
a
variety
of
the
issues
that
have
frankly
divided
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
questions
of
what
goes
into
plan
design
as
opposed
to
fiduciary
responsibilities,
questions
of
how
broadly
do
you
define
the
plan
and
its
benefits.
none
of
those
issues
are
any
longer
on
the
table.
what
is
on
the
table
is
whether
the
provision
of
medical
care
and
the
methods
of
compensation
for
medical
care,
right,
are
part
of,
quote,
plan
administration
within
the
meaning
of
section
1002(21)(a),
which
is
the
definition
provision
in
erisa
for
a
fiduciary,
and
it
is
completely
counterintuitive
to
suggest
that
plan
administration
extends
to
the
provision
of
medical
care,
just
as
a
matter
of
simple
language
of
the
statute.
and
then
second,
and
what
i
think
is
really
the
most
driving
force
in
all
of
this,
is
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
law,
because
it
seems
to
me
absolutely
inconceivable
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
these
kinds
of
medical
treatment
judgments
and
the
compensation
schemes
that
go
into
them
are,
in
fact,
administration
of
an
erisa
plan,
that
that
then
doesn't
preempt
all
state
law
that
relates
to
those
issues,
which
means--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
situation
like
that
arising.
that's
certainly
not
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
here.
i
think
in
that
situation,
though,
you
still
have
to
take
a
very
careful
look
at,
you
know,
if
we're
just
talking
about
a
physician
making
a
statement
and
making
a
mistake,
i
don't
think
that's
part
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
plan
administration.
that's
simply
potentially
a
breach
of
contract
that
somebody
could
deal
with
differently.
you
know,
the
key
here
is,
to
what
extent
do
you
want
to
drive
in
the
elaborate
mechanisms
of
erisa
as
part
of
an
effort
to
interfere
with
the
relationship
between
the
physicians
and
the
patients
in
the
hmo
context,
and
my
own
judgment
is
the
court
would
be
quite
better
served
by
trying
to
move
erisa
back
further
in
the
scheme
of
things,
but
at
a
minimum
it
certainly
shouldn't
be
intruded
into
the
physician-patient
relationship
to
the
extent
of
deciding
what
kinds
of
medical
treatment
judgments
are
valid,
and
what
kinds
of
compensation
schemes
are
permissible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
hinge
erisa
scope
on
the
subjective
intent
of
the
patient
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
even
that
i
think
is
probably
a
mistake,
because
the
question...
the
question
is,
you
know,
you're
in
a
fiduciary
world
when
you're
administering
a
plan,
and
the
question
is...
and
then
you
have...
because
then
you
have
a
whole
series
of
questions,
is
there
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
what
the
remedy
for
it
is,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
i
don't
think
the
court
wants
to
get
into
the
business
of
saying
that
this
is,
in
fact,
a
fiduciary
relationship
based
on
erisa.
it's
certainly
a
physician-patient
fiduciary
responsibility.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
breyer.
under
our
broader
theory
none
of
this
is
within
the...
an
employer
welfare
benefit
plan,
in
which
case
none
of
this
is
subject
to
any
kinds
of
erisa
requirements,
but
the
second,
and
i
think
the
more
pointed
answer
to
that
really
comes
to
the
question
of
what
has
she
in
fact
alleged,
and
can
you
read
the
complaint
potentially
to
embrace
what
you've
described--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
breyer,
but
the
question
is,
what
does
she
mean
by
those
particular
words,
because
all
she's
really
doing
there
is
alleging
how
the
plan
operates
and
then
using
the
statutory
language.
but
go
back
to
page
9
of
her
brief,
justice
breyer,
and
analyze
exactly
what
it
is
that
she
says.
the
sole
focus
of
that
complaint,
that
entire
count
of
that
complaint,
is
limited
to
the
question
of
financial
incentives
to
deprive
someone
of
particular
medical
treatment.
that's
what
she's
defended
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
reinstating
her
claim
on,
that's
what's
before
the
court,
and
i
don't
see
why
the
court
should
go
beyond
that
analysis
in
trying
to
resolve
what
otherwise
seems
to
me
a
very
significant
thicket
that
it
would
other...
that
it
would
have
to
address.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
just
read
it
in
the
way
the
respondent
has
asked
you
to
read
it.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
do
any
more
than
the
respondent
has
pitched
this
argument
to
you
herself.
there's
no
reason
to
start
over.
let's
start
where
the
respondent
starts
and
analyze
the
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
assume,
justice
ginsburg,
that
she
simply
somehow
made
a
mistake
here
rather
than
a
conscious
judgment
to
attack
what
it
is
that
is
the
gravamen
of
her
complaint.
her
complaint
is
not
a
coverage
issue.
her
complaint
is
the
quality
of
care
that
she
received.
it
is
bound
up
in
the
malpractice
claim
that
she
brought,
so
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
also
a
case
that
comes
to
the
court
as
presented
by
the
parties,
and
the
respondent
has
told
you
how
she
defends
the
judgment
below,
and
i
think
the
court
ought
to
accept
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it's
not
clear.
i
mean,
there
are
a
whole
slew
of
questions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
accept
that
premise
either,
but
what
i'm
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
avoid
having
to
address
that
issue
by
reaching
what
i
think
is
a
narrower
and
much
simpler
ground
for
reversal
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
souter,
and
i
don't
have--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
might
be
in
trouble
already,
but...
no,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
context
what
she's
complaining
about
is
the
physician
decision
to
withhold
treatment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
court
ought
to
just
focus
on
what
it
is
she
has
alleged
and
leave
for
another
day
the
situation
you
pose.
i
don't
concede
it,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
address
it
at
this
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
assume
that
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
true.
i
mean,
i
understand
that,
but
again,
i
don't
know
why
we
would
go
beyond
the
specific
allegations
in
the
complaint,
as
defended
by
the
respondent
here.
i'd
reserve
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
would
