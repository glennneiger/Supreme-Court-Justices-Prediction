unknown
speaker
well
now,
i
gather
that
the
ms.
herdrich
did
recover
in
a
malpractice
action
in
this
very
case.
unknown
speaker
the
question
isn't
whether
there's
some
reason.
the
question
is
whether
it's
been
added,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
really
not
a
policy
question
that's
up
to
us.
it's
either
there
or
it's
not
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
would
you
clarify
one
thing?
you
said
all
hmo's
would
fall
because
this
is
a
plain
vanilla
scheme,
and
yet
your
opponents
say
that
it's
only
a
particular
kind
of
hmo,
one
where
the
physicians
have
this
incentive
because
of
their
bonuses,
and
that
not
all
hmo's
work
that
way.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
could
you
just
clarify
one
simple
point
for
me?
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
opponent,
but
given
the
fact
that
she's
already
recovered
for
the
malpractice,
what
do
you
understand
the
nature
of
her
recovery
would
be?
assume
she's
right
and
you're
wrong.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
contend
there
isn't
really
a
live
case
here,
though?
unknown
speaker
mr.--
--well,
you
agree
there's
not
a
live
case
if
she's
not
seeking
any
remedy?
unknown
speaker
is
a
judgment,
but
not
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
a
judgment
is
not
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
are
there
any
circumstances
under
which
an
hmo
can
be
found
to
be
a
fiduciary,
for
instance,
in
administering
claims
or
benefits
to
which
a
covered
employee
is
entitled?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
do
we
know
that
there
are
no
such
coverage
determinations
being
made
by
this
hmo?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--whereabouts
on
page
9?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
to
people
who
are
covered?
unknown
speaker
to
people
who
are
covered,
not
excluding
people
from
coverage?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you--
--but
mr.
phillips,
maybe...
maybe
your
opponent
thought
it
unnecessary
to
say
anything
to
that
effect
because
in
your
very
own
memorandum
in
opposition
to
the
plaintiff's
motion
to
remand
to
the
state
court
you
allege
that...
and
this
is
on
page
24a
of
the
brief
in
opposition...
you
allege
that
health
alliance
was
the
administrator
and
fiduciary
of
the
plan
within
the
meaning
of
erisa,
so
if
you
yourself
alleged
that
health
alliance
was
the
administrator,
then
certainly
you
lull
the
other
side
into
security
on
that
point.
you
had
conceded
it.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
you
go
to
your
doctor
and
you
give
him
or
his
staff
your
health
care
policy,
your
hmo
policy
and
you
say,
i
can't
understand
this
stuff.
is
my
operation
covered
or
not?
and
the
doctor
says,
no
it
isn't,
because
he
doesn't
want
to
do
it,
it's
too
expensive,
et
cetera.
then
you
elect
not
to
have
it
and
something
happens.
is
there
some
gray
areas
where
the
doctor
may
be
wearing
two
hats
and
really
be
determining
eligibility
for
you,
because
you
do...
i'm
sure
patients
do
rely
on
doctors
to
tell
them
this
type
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
do
we
talk
about
the
employee
or
the
patient's
legitimate
expectation
as
to
what
that
employee
is
receiving
from
the
doctors?
they
go
to
the
doctor
either
for
medical
care
or
for
advice
about
what
the
plan
means.
is
that
the
beginning
point,
the
legitimate
expectations
of
the
covered
employee?
unknown
speaker
reasonable
legitimate
expectations.
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
we
get
out
of...
i
mean,
the
statute
says
that
a
fiduciary
is
a
person
under
erisa.
an
erisa
fiduciary
is
a
person
who
exercises
discretionary
authority
or
control
respecting
management
of
a
plan
who
has
any
discretionary
authority
or
responsibility
in
the
plan's
administration.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
unknown
speaker
then
what
they've
alleged...
whether
it's
true
or
not,
they've
alleged
it.
they
say
that
these
people
here,
the
hmo,
have
been
given
by
contract
the
authority
to
administer
disputed
claims.
i
take
it
that
they've
been
given
by
contract
the
authority
to
decide,
am
i
covered
by
the
policy
that
my
employer
bought,
or
am
i
not,
and
in
particular
they
say
that's
true
of
emergency
treatment,
that's
true
as
to
whether
something
is...
is
it
routine,
is
it
experimental,
which
plans
are
covered,
which
claims
are
covered,
which
are
not.
now,
that's
their
allegation,
so
how
in
your
view
is
that
not
administering
the
discretionary
administration
of
the
employer
purchase
plan
itself?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
just
read,
was
reading
from
the--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
say
forget
roman
numeral
ii,
small
ii,
just
focus
on
i.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you're
making
of
this
a
pleading
case.
you're
saying
she
didn't
allege
it,
not
that
she
couldn't
allege
it.
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
accept
your
position
it
goes
back,
and
they
amend
the
complaint
to
say
no,
we're
talking
about
the
role
of
this
hmo
in
making
eligibility
and
coverage
determinations.
unknown
speaker
in
a
sense
this
has
to
be
a
pleading
case,
because
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
is
it
clear
that
making
a
determination
as
to
coverage
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
administration
of
a
plan?
unknown
speaker
i
hate
to
depart
from
that
as
a
premise,
because
i'm
not
sure
that
premise
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a...
it
may
be
a
too-simple
question,
but
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
breyer,
but
i
think,
like
him
and
maybe
some
others
here,
i
can't
help
but
think
of
what
the
next
case
is
going
to
be,
depending
on
how
narrowly
or
broadly
we
might
decide
this,
if
we
decide
it
in
your
favor.
is
there
a
kind
of
a
simple-minded
administrative
answer
to
some
of
our
problems,
and
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
this.
let's
assume
that
there
can
be
some
decisions
about
coverage
which,
if
made
in
bad
faith,
would,
in
fact,
be
decisions
about
the
management
of
the
plan
and
that
would,
in
fact,
if
made
in
bad
faith,
involve
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
the
assumption
that
i
have
made
is
that
characteristically
those
decisions
are
not
made
by
physicians,
that
someone
walks
into
a
clinic
or
an
office
and
gets
some
treatment.
in
an
hmo,
when
they
go
in
the
person
at
the
front
desk
says,
the
plan
doesn't
cover
appendixes.
doctors
don't
make
decisions
like
that,
by
and
large.
when
there's
a
true
reimbursement
scheme
the
procedure
is
done,
the
claim
is
submitted
to
the
insurance
company,
and
somebody
in
an
office
somewhere
says,
oh,
this
plan
doesn't
cover
appendixes,
so
most
of
the
decisions
which
might
be
called
management
decisions,
which,
if
made
in
bad
faith
could
arguably
be
breaches
of
fiduciary
responsibility,
are
probably
not
going
to
be
physician
decisions.
am
i
being
too
simple-minded
in
looking
at
it--
unknown
speaker
--if
i
am,
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble
later.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
in
his
hypothetical
the
person
at
the
front
desk
may
be
an
employee
of
the
physician's.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
gravamen
of
this
complaint.
unknown
speaker
the
whole
hmo
is
owned
by
physicians,
so
you
know,
if
some
secretary
at
the
front
desk...
it's
the
physician's,
because
they
own
the
hmo
and
employ
the
secretary.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
wasn't
it
emphasized
by
the
other
side
that
if
only
there
were
somebody
else
making
the
coverage
and
eligibility
decisions,
if
only
that,
they
would
have
no
complaint?
i
thought
that
that
was
very
clear
from
the
respondent's
presentation,
that
they
weren't
complaining
about
treatment,
that
the
only
thing
they
were
complaining
about
was
having
the
coverage
eligibility
determination
made
by
the
physician.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
it's
also
your
position,
i
take
it,
that
not
every
claim
of
an
error
in
the
claim
processing
function
without
more
would
state
a
breach
of...
a
claim
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
they
just
get
it
wrong,
if
a
fiduciary
just
gets
it
wrong,
that's
not
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
without
something
more.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you...
you
see,
i
never
thought
that
a
judge
has
discretion
in
deciding
whether
the
law
means
this
or
that.
there's
a
right
answer
and
a
wrong
answer.
the
judge
tries
to
find
the
right
answer,
and
isn't
it
the
same
thing
when
somebody
determines
plan
coverage?
it
seems
to
me
strange
to
talk
about
discretion
in
determining
plan
coverage.
why
is
that
a
discretionary
administration
of
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
the
definition
of
what
fiduciary
duty
is,
that
they
must
always
discharge
the
duties
solely
in
the
interests
of
the
participants
and
the
beneficiaries,
so
that
if
you
take
this
literally,
and
if
you
say
that's
a
fiduciary
responsibility,
every
debatable
case
would
have
to
be
ruled
in
favor
of
the
beneficiaries.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
mean
you
always
have
to
rule
in
favor
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
have
an
ambiguous
plan
document,
if
its
duty
is
to
act
solely
in
the
interests
of
the
participant
or
the
beneficiaries,
it's
a
pretty
tough
standard.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
feld...
that
makes
perfect
sense
except
when
you
bear
in
mind
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
to
justice
scalia.
we
have
language
in
these
plans
in
which
there's
a
range
in
which
reasonable
judgments
can
be
made
and
still
be
faithful
to
the
language,
and
in
that
situation
i
think
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
has
got
to
be,
it's
always
got
to
be
made
in
the
patient's
favor.
unknown
speaker
you've
always
got
to
choose
the
point
in
the
reasonable
spectrum
that
gives
the
plaintiff
what
the...
the
patient
what
the
patient
wants.
either
that
or
it's
not
a
discretionary
judgment.
yeah.
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
any--
unknown
speaker
--or
it's
not
a
fiduciary--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
feldman,
i
had
thought--
unknown
speaker
--you
seem
not
to
be
taking
the
position
that
i
thought
would
be
the
one
that
you
would
take,
which
is
that
the
word
beneficiaries
is
plural,
and
sometimes
what
may
be
in
the
best
interests
of
a
particular
plaintiff
could
be
against
the
interests
of
the
class
of
beneficiaries.
that
came
up
in
the
former
pay-for-services--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
feldman,
couldn't
the
administrator
say,
if
i
resolve
every
single
debatable
point
in
favor
of
each
beneficiary,
other
beneficiaries
are
going
to
suffer?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--you
yourself
had
said
the
terms
can
be
very
vague.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
a
particular
decision
in
relation
to
a
particular
beneficiary,
i
thought.
i
thought
we
were
talking...
what
they
allege
is
that
a
plan
that
sets
up
a
certain
structure
with
economic
incentives
is
wrong,
and
when
you
decide
what
kind
of
a
plan,
can't
you
take
the
interests
of
all
the
beneficiaries
into
account?
unknown
speaker
and
that,
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
except--
unknown
speaker
--when
you
apply
it
you
have
to
look
at
this
beneficiary,
but
when
you're
deciding
specifically
whether
to
have
a
rule
that
gives
an
incentive
to
doctors
to
do
x,
y,
or
z,
that's
a
matter
for
all
the
beneficiaries,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
on
your
question
as
to
assume--
unknown
speaker
--assume
they
are
a
fiduciary
for
the
sake
of
argument.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
your
argument
is
that
what
gets
them
out
of
this
is,
they're
not
fiduciaries
in
respect
to
making
up
the
incentive
rules
under
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
okay.
that's
my
question.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
fine.
if
in
some
circumstances
it
can,
a
particular
incentive
structure,
created
by
some
administrators
who
maybe
are
a
part
of
the
organization
they're
suing,
could,
in
fact,
violate
erisa,
and
in
other
times
it
wouldn't
violate
erisa,
what's
the
principle
as
to
when
it
does
and
when
it
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
ginzkey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it,
because
if
they
had
it
separate,
then
your
clients
or
some
future
clients
would
simply
sue
the
right
group.
i
mean,
i
take
it
the
underlying
substantive
question
is,
whoever
is
making
this
decision,
you're
saying
it's
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
have
a
set
of
economic
incentives
that
makes
them
look
at
costs
as
well
as
health.
now,
the
separation
issue
is
one,
that
even
assuming
you're
right
on
that,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
in
respect
to
cost
incentives
that
the
same
congress
that
in
1973
wrote
an
hmo
act,
and
the
same
congress
that
has
provided
for
incentives
that
encourage
hmo's
throughout,
in
erisa,
without
saying
anything,
wanted
to
gut
its
own
hmo
legislation.
now,
that's
where
i
start
on
this,
and
i
put
that
up
front,
because
i
want
to
know
how
your
theory
doesn't
achieve
a
result
that
i
just
find
it
very
hard
to
believe
congress
wanted.
unknown
speaker
what
they're
saying
is
that
we
think,
for
example,
if
you
have
a
group
of
people
who
look
after
a
child
from
the
time
it's
born
to
the
time
it
dies,
they'll
get
interested,
through
our
incentives,
in
what's
called
preventive
care,
and
will
end
up
with
a
lot
less
disease.
now,
to
do
that,
you
have
to
have
doctors
who
pay
attention
to
patients
all
across
the
board,
and
you
also
have
to
tell
those
doctors,
don't
use
the
most
expensive
treatment
before
you
look
at
what
will
actually
benefit
the
patient
throughout
the
cost
of
his
life.
unknown
speaker
the
whole
course
of
his
life.
now,
that,
i
take
it,
is
the
theory
that
underlies
these
kinds
of
cost
incentives
that
are
built
into
the
plan.
now,
if
congress...
doesn't
congress
make
that
judgment
with
hmo's,
or
similar
kinds
of
judgments?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your...
but
i'm
asking
not
my
theory,
i'm
asking
your
theory
on
this.
unknown
speaker
how
many
hmo's
fall
in
this
pattern
of
physician-owned...
you
said
that
you
thought
most
were
not
that
way.
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
are?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
don't
have
many
doctors,
they
presumably
can't
afford
to
hire
an
independent
administrator.
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
small
organization.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ginzkey,
i
didn't
get
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
there's
separation
or
not.
let's
assume
that
doctors
don't
make
the
decisions,
so
you
have
some
other
organization
that
makes
the
decisions.
so
long
as
that
organization
has
the
same
incentive
of
keeping
costs
down,
wouldn't
that
organization
fall
prey
to
the
same
complaint
that
you
make
here?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't...
nothing
distinct
about
doctors
making
it.
your
complaint
is
that
whoever
is
making
the
decision
about
what
treatment
ought
to
be
given
has
a
financial
incentive
that
is
not
necessarily
coincident
with
the
best
interests
of
the
patient.
that's
going
to
be
the
case
whether
it's
the
doctor
doing
it
or
somebody
further
up
the
line,
so
long
as
you
have
this
kind
of
an
hmo.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
they
have
to
bring
in
not
only
somebody
other
than
the
doctors,
but
somebody
other
than
the
doctors
who
has
no
financial
interest
in
the
whole
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
hire
some
firm
to
make
medical
decisions
of
whether
you
get
this
operation
or
not--
unknown
speaker
--some
firm
that
is
not
the
owning
doctors
of
the
hmo
and
that
also
has
no
financial
interest
in
the
whole
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
i
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's--
--well,
supposing
you
hire--
--that's
what
i
said.
supposing
a
small
group
of
doctors
hires
an
administrator
and
the
administrator
administers
claims,
and
then
the
doctors
tell
him,
you
know,
you're
just
allowing
a
lot
of
stuff
we
don't
think
you
should
allow,
and
as
a
result
our
income
is
going
down.
what's
the
result
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
giving
your
own
hypothesis,
but
i
put
a
hypothesis
to
you
that
i
wish
you
would
respond
to.
unknown
speaker
would
you
respond
a
little
more
directly?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
difference
perhaps
in
degree.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
degree
of
finesse,
but
isn't...
at
the
end
of
the
day,
isn't
the
operative
fact
that
in
any
hmo
the
interest
of
the
hmo
and
the
interest
of
every
employee,
whether...
of
the
hmo,
whether
it
be
a
doctor
or
a
nondoctor
administrator,
is
to
hold
down
health
cost,
because
unless
they
do
so
the
hmo
is
going
to
go
out
of
business?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
interest
is
there,
whether
it
is
in
the
stark
shape
that
it
takes
here,
or
whether
it's
in
a
more
subtle
shape
which
it
takes
on
your
hypothesis
of
what
is
right,
but
the
same
interest
is
there,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
equally...
if
the
interest
in
this
case
is
at
odds
with
fiduciary
duty,
i
don't
see
why
the
interest
in
the
more
subtle
case
isn't
equally
at
odds
with
fiduciary
duty.
unknown
speaker
but
why...
i
know
it
is,
but
why
does
the
mechanism
make
a
difference,
because
what
you
say
is
wrong
with
the
mechanism
is
that
it
induces
these
so-called
fiduciaries
to
say,
no
care
for
you,
but
that
same
mechanism
operating
at
a
perhaps
less
obvious
level
is
inherent
in
any
hmo,
so
i
don't
see
why
the
mechanism
makes
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
in
effect,
the...
the
rule
of
decision
that
you
want
us
to
come
down
with
i
think
is,
we've
just
got
to
draw
lines
here
and
say,
the
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
clear
when
the
doctors
get
a
year-end
payment
and
make
the
decision.
there
is,
however,
no
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
or
at
least
not
a
cognizable
one,
when
the
interest
between
denying
coverage
and
ultimate
compensation
is
more
subtle
than
that.
that's
the
rule
of
decision
that
you
want?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
in
order
not
to
do
so,
aren't
you
asking
us
for
a
rule
of
decision
something
like
what
i
just
put
to
you?
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose...
you
may
have
a
very
good
answer
to
this,
and
i'm
on
exactly
the
same
track,
but
take
as
separate
a
person
as
you
want,
you
know,
somebody
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
doctors,
that
works
for
the
erisa
trust
plan
of
a
company,
and
that
person
says,
here's
what
our
plan's
going
to
do.
we're
going
to
take
a
bunch
of
doctors,
and
we're
going
to
pay
them
3,300
per
patient
per
year,
and
we
say,
doctors,
you
take
on
some
patients.
now,
we'll
tell
you
about
this
money.
what
you
don't
spend,
you
keep.
all
right?
that's
our
rule.
and
now
what's
sort
of...
what's
bothering
me
is
that
the
rule
that
you
want
would
outlaw
the
rule
that
i
just
said,
and
why
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
i...
see,
my
rule
draws
its
strength
from
the
fact
that
we
know
there
are
a
group
of
ethical
rules
governing
medicine,
and
doctors,
we
believe,
governed
by
this
when
they
take
the
3,300,
will
try
to
look
for
the
best
way
of
saving
the
patient
anyway,
and
if
they
can
do
so
with
a
little
saving
extra
money,
that's
to
their
benefit.
so
that's
why
my
rule
sounded
okay.
maybe
it's
true,
maybe
it's
not,
but
your
role
sounds
as
if
it
abolishes
my
rule,
so
now,
how...
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
they
all
attributed
the
same
meaning
to
the
word
unduly,
which
is
extremely
vague?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
questionnaire
say?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
i
take
your
answer
to
be
that
you're
saying
that
i
thought
what
was
a
good
legal
rule
isn't,
and
you
don't
mind
that
if
i
decide
for
you
we
also
make
unlawful
under
erisa
the
rule
that
i
talked
about,
the
3,300
per
patient,
or
are
you
going
to
distinguish
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
can
you
tell
me...
maybe
you've
said
this
already,
and
i'm
sorry
if
i'm
asking
you
to
repeat
it,
but
the
distinction
precisely
between
the
one
i
had
and
the
one
you
want
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ginzkey--
unknown
speaker
--why
should
the
courts
get
into
this
slippery
slope
problem
that
you're
posing
for
us
when
congress
has
designed
a
scheme
that's
built
on
private
furnishing
of
health
care
through
health
maintenance
organizations
that
are
privately
owned,
and
where
there
are
inherently
incentives
to
keep
costs
down
at
the
hmo
in
order
to
provide
the
care
and
make
it
pay
for
itself?
and
that's
the
scheme
congress
has
authorized,
and
they
are
served
by
doctors
that
have
ethical
obligations
in
the
treatment
of
patients,
and
i
suppose
congress
relied
on
the
ability
of
the
enforcement
of
those
ethical
obligations
to
curb
what
otherwise
might
appear
to
be
an
unfortunate
financial
incentive
to
cut
costs,
and
i...
why
should
the
courts
get
involved
in
this
messy
business
of
deciding
what
scheme
is
an
undue
infringement
and
what
isn't?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
your
opponent
at
the
beginning
of
the
case?
what's
really
at
stake
for
your
client
in
this
case,
at
this
stage?
unknown
speaker
recoup
it
for
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
and
who
would
the...
if
there's
this
money
that
should...
that's
been
accumulated,
who
would
get
the
fund?
would
it
go
back
into
the
hmo,
or
would
it
go
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--is
that--
--i
thought
she
was
suing
on
her
own
behalf.
unknown
speaker
on
behalf
of
the
plan?
well,
let
me...
i'm
a
little
confused
by
some
of
your
presentation,
because
you
talked
about
coverage
determinations,
and
as
i
understand
what
occurred
here,
there
was
no
denial
of
coverage
to
your--
unknown
speaker
--to
your
client.
unknown
speaker
it
was
acknowledged
that
what
she
was
suffering
from
was
covered
by
the
plan,
and
what
her
complaint
was
is
that
she
got
procedure
a
whereas
she
should
have
had
procedure
b,
which
was
more
expensive,
and
they
didn't
give
her
b
because
of
the
cost.
isn't
that
right?
so
how
do
we
get
into
the
coverage
determination
question
at
all?
why
is
that
even
involved
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
have
to
consider
that,
then,
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
you
say
she
should
have
had
some
other
kind
of
treatment,
which
would
have
been
more
expensive,
right?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was.
unknown
speaker
but
explain
something
else
to
me,
if
you
would.
the
hmo
here
contracted
with
state
farm
mutual,
is
it,
and
who
would
get
the
money
if
there
is...
the
doctors
had
to
pay
some
money?
the
hmo
wouldn't
get
it,
because
they
are
the
doctors.
unknown
speaker
to
the
risk
pool?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a...
forgive
my
stupidity,
but
what
is
the
risk
pool?
who...
what
fund
of
money...
who
owns
that?
is
that
the
insurance
company's
property?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
plan
asset.
unknown
speaker
well,
who
would
physically...
supposing
you
get
this
money,
who
actually
gets
title
to
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it
goes
back
to
the
hmo.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
qualifies
you
as
a
representative
of
the
people
in
the
risk
pool?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ginzkey,
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
scalia?
you
were
telling
him
what
this
case
was
not.
you
said,
it's
not
a
malpractice
case.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
coverage
case.
it's
not
a
denial
of
benefits
case.
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
resulting
in
what
kind
of
harm?
i
mean,
in
a
malpractice
case
we
know
what
the
harm
is.
in
a
coverage
case,
we...
and
so
on.
what
exactly
is
the
harm?
the
harm
is
simply
that
the
risk
pool
is
smaller
than
it
otherwise
would
be?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
basically
making
a
financial
management
claim.
you're
saying,
they're
misapplying
funds?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will...
you
know,
i
will
assume
that,
but
may
i
just
come
back
to
a
follow-up
question.
assuming,
and
you
know
your
case,
this
is
a
mismanagement
of
funds
case--
unknown
speaker
--am
i
right
that
in
order
for
you,
which
i
think
we've
all
been
assuming,
am
i
right
that
in
order
for
you
to
make
out
your
case
that
there
has
been
mismanagement
of
funds,
it's
necessary
for
us
to
accept
the
proposition
that
whenever
a
physician
in
an
hmo
has
a
strong
financial
incentive
to
make
a
medical
decision,
that
that
medical
decision
is
therefore
a
fiduciary
decision,
and
is
therefore...
and
therefore
a
claim
against
him
is
preempted
from
state
malpractice
law
in
favor
of
erisa
fiduciary
law?
unknown
speaker
then
it's
not
the
median
term.
why
isn't
it
the
median
term
in
order
to
get
your
result?
unknown
speaker
and
that
kind
of
decision
was
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it?
i
mean,
isn't
that
your
understanding
of
what
you're
claiming,
that
that
kind
of
decision
was
crucial
to
your
claim
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
realize--
unknown
speaker
--i
didn't
realize
you
were
making
any
erisa
claim.
i
thought
you
were
making
state
claims,
and
the
reason
all
of
this
comes
up
is
that
the
objection
to
your
count
iii
and
count
iv
state
claims
was
that
they
were
preempted
by
erisa.
unknown
speaker
where
does
that
appear
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--amended
count
iii.
so
we've
actually...
now,
your
client's
appendectomy
is
irrelevant,
the
malpractice
is
irrelevant,
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
it's
entirely...
which
is...
i
mean,
and
then
it's
going
to
come
down
to
either
the
fiduciary
issue,
or
if
you
are
fiduciaries,
we
have
to
figure
out
what
the
standard
is
on
what
incentives
could
be
so
extreme
that
they
violate
the
obligation
to
everybody.
is
that
basically
where
we
are?
unknown
speaker
and
what
in
your
view
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether...
because
you
concede
that
some
incentive
plans
could
be
okay,
so
what's
the
standard
for
determining...
and
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
there
could
be
some
that
weren't
okay.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
know.
unknown
speaker
so
now
we've
got
a
lot
of
agreement
here,
and
what
we've
got
to--
[laughter]
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
difference
in
the
standard,
then,
as
to
when
they're
okay
when
they're
not
okay?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
how
would
you
draw
it?
