mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
phillips
indicated
that
it's
no
exaggeration
to
indicate
that
this
particular
lawsuit
is
an
attack
on
managed
care
as
a
whole,
that
what
we
have
is
a
standard
plain
vanilla
hmo.
i
beg
to
differ
with
that.
we
don't
have,
in
this
case,
a
standard,
plain
vanilla
hmo,
and
maybe
drawing
a
comparison
to
another
type
of
hmo
is
the
best
example
of
what
i'm
trying
to
describe
here.
take
an
hmo
like
humana.
humana
is
a
publicly
traded
corporation.
there
are
over
167
million
outstanding
shares
of
humana
stock.
the
owners
of
the
humana
stock,
as
owners,
are
a
group
of
people
that
are
separate
and
distinct
from
humana,
the
company
that
employs
the
claims
reviewers
and
the
medical
directors.
separate
and
apart
from
that
group
is
then
the
contracted
physicians
that
provide
the
services,
so
in
many,
if
not
most
hmo's,
you've
got
three
distinct
groups.
you've
got
the
owners,
separate
and
apart
from
the
employees
of
the
company
making
the
claims
decisions,
separate
and
apart
from
the
doctors
who
are
providing
the
primary
care.
here,
all
three
groups
are
one.
they're
all
one
entity.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
the
health
maintenance
organization
act
was
passed
in
1973.
erisa
was
passed
in
1974.
in
1974,
we
did
not
have
the
forms
of
managed
care
that
we
now
have.
with
respect
to
the
hmo
act
of
1973,
that
is
enabling
legislation.
it
does
not
specify
anywhere
in
that
act
what
cost
containment
mechanism
should
or
should
not
be
used.
that
is
not
specified,
and
it
to
my
knowledge
is
not
specified
by
any...
in
any
regulation
by
the
department
of
labor
or
any
other
bureaucracy
of
the
federal
government.
the
phenomenon
that
we
have
with
respect
to
these
physician
bonuses,
the
physician
incentives,
is
a
relatively
recent
phenomenon.
it
first
came
to
the
government's
attention
in
the
1986
report
by
the
gao,
where
they
concluded
that
incentives
seem
to
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
health
of
the
patients
being
treated
by
the
doctors
who
are
incentivized.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
and
we're
not
suggest--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
congress
does
make--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--well,
and
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
question
that
you
posed
immediately
before
that,
and
that
question
was,
why
does
it
make
a
difference
that
in
this
particular
structure,
this
corporate
structure
of
this
hmo,
you've
got
the
employees
who
are
making
a
claims
decision,
the
medical
directors,
all
four
of
them,
being
the
same
doctors
who
profit
from
that
bonus
at
the
end
of
the
year.
you
don't
have
an
independent
third
party
administrator
making
those
claims
decisions.
that's
one
of
the
major
distinctions
in
this
case.
it
also
explains
some
of
the
solicitor
general's,
i
think
misconceptions
with
respect
to
various
relationships
of
the
parties,
because
the
doctors
that
are
the
owners,
the
sole
owners
of
the
hmo,
and
employ
themselves
as
the
primary
care
physicians,
aren't
dealing
at
arm's
length.
one
of
the
positions
of
the
solicitor
general
is
that
you
can't
have
any
limitations,
as
we
suggest
in
this
particular
case,
upon
an
hmo's
right
to
contract
with
doctors.
that
assumes
that
the
contracting
that's
going
on
is
at
arm's
length.
it's
not
here.
they're
one
and
the
same
entity.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
i
don't
have
percentages,
justice
ginsburg.
i
can
tell
you
that
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
doctor-owned
hmo's,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
one
that
is
structured
like
this,
where
the
doctors
not
only
are
the
owners,
and
employing
themselves
on
the
opposite
end,
they're
also
the
decisionmakers
in
the
middle.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
i
don't
know
what
the
cost
of
a
third-party
administrator
would
be,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
cost
in-house
is
getting
paid
for
by
the
premiums
being
charged
in
any
event.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
no.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
that
the
claims
administrators
with
a
third
party
administration
firm
aren't
getting
paid
to
deny
the
claims,
and
that's
what's
happening
here,
because
the
claims
administrators
of
this
hmo
are
the
very
owners
of
the
hmo
that
share
in
the
year-end
distribution.
the
year-end
distribution
is
not
something
that
isn't
controlled
by
the
physicians
to
a
certain
extent,
because
these
are
actuarially
underwritten
plans,
and
by
that
i
mean
this.
when
the
hmo
makes
a
bid
to
state
farm
insurance
that
we're
going
to
cover
this
particular
individual
at
100
per
month,
that's
what
it's
going
to
cost
us
to
provide
that
health
care
for
that
much
for
that
individual,
that's
not
the
premium
that
is
charged.
there's
a
premium
loading
factor
that
is
added
in
here,
and
what--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--no,
not--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--not
some--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
i'm
saying
that
you've
got
to
have
somebody
that
is
making
those
claims
decisions
that
doesn't
have
a
basis,
isn't
receiving
money
to
deny
the
claims,
because
that's
what's
going
on
here.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
here,
if
i
can
draw
on
the
analogy,
or
the
explanation
i
was
trying
to
give
earlier,
here
what
you
have
is
the,
let's
say
100
per
member
per
month
cost
of
providing
the
medical
care.
that's
increased.
there's
premium
loading
factors,
generally
about
20
percent,
that's
added
on
right
on
top.
that
120
then
is
paid
on
a
monthly
basis
to
the
hmo.
the
20
profit
is
taken
off
the
top.
that
constitutes
profit,
administration
costs
and
costs
of
advertizing,
but--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--and
i'm
trying
to
respond
to
that.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
scenario
that
you
have
suggested
and
a
scenario
where
the
claims
determiners
are
the
ones
who
are
doing
the
determination
of
the
actuarial
underwriting
so
that
they
know
what's
going
to
be
in
that
risk
pool
at
the
end
of
the
year
and,
to
the
extent
that
they
can
deny
claims,
there's
more
money
in
the
risk
pool
for
distribution
at
year-end
to
them.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
it's
the
mechanism
that
we're
focusing
on
here,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
the
mechanism
makes
the
difference
here
because
these
physicians
in
their
capacity
as
owners
of
this
hmo
are
getting
paid
bonuses
to
deny
care,
and
let
me
explain
that
a
little
bit
further.
counsel
indicates
that
on
page
9
of
our
red
brief
we
took
the
position
that
the
sole
focus
of
attention
of
amended
count
iii
is
the
design
and
administration
of
an
undisclosed
physician
incentive
to
withhold
treatment.
that's
taken
out
of
context.
that
entire
paragraph
on
page
9
deals
with
cost
containments,
and
what
we're
saying
is,
we're
only
focusing
on
one
cost
containment
mechanism.
we're
not
arguing
about,
for
instance,
pre-certification.
pre-certification
is
a
cost
containment
element
that
can
be
used,
employed
by
managed
care,
that
is
going
to
lower
health
care
costs,
but
it's
not
going
to
be
a
situation
where
the
doctor
is
getting
paid
a
bonus
to
look
the
other
way
when
somebody
is
sick
so--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
outlaw
physician
incentives,
to
declare
them
illegal.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
line
drawn,
and
i
think
that
the
line
is
drawn
with
reference
to
incentives
reaching
the
level
of
undue
influence
so
that
it
affects
patient
care.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
because
the
rule
that
we're
suggesting
here
is
not
that
broad,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
because
that
type
of
incentive
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
undue
influence
that
is
going
to
have
a
deleterious
effect,
necessarily,
on
patient
health
care,
and
let
me
point
the
court
to
the
study
that
was
performed
in
1998
out
in
california.
excuse
me.
it
was
published
in
1998,
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine.
it
was
766
primary
care
physicians
in
the
state
of
california.
a
questionnaire
went
out.
i
believe
it
was
anonymous.
a
questionnaire
goes
out,
do
you
have
any
incentives
in
your
managed
care
or
hmo
plan?
yes.
40
percent
of
them
have
incentives.
do
they
influence
you,
at
least
to
some
degree?
over
50
percent
say,
yes,
they
influence
us
to
some
degree.
third
question,
are
they
unduly
influencing
you,
and
that's
not
the
word
that's
used
in
the
report.
what
they
say
is,
or
what
the
doctors
say,
17
percent
of
them
in
that
study,
and
i
think
that
that
study
is
probably
representative
of
health
care
in
the
united
states,
what
17
percent
of
those
doctors
in
california
say
is
that
those
incentives
are
high
enough,
large
enough
that
they
feel
it
does
compromise
quality
of
care.
that's
what
the
physicians
say.
that's
what
they're
telling
us.
we
don't
have
to
hypothecate.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that
was
my
term,
your
honor,
and
that
was
a
bad
term.
the--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--are
the
incentives
high
enough
that
it
is
having
a
significant,
deleterious
effect
on
health
care
that
you're
providing,
and
17
percent
of
them
said
yes,
so--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
it.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
depending
on
what
the
rate
of
capitation
is
in
your
hypothetical,
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
rule
that
i'm
suggesting,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
courts
should
make
that
determination
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
just
not
exempt
entire
groups--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--from
erisa.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
let
me
respond
firstly
by
saying
i'm
only
aware
of
one
case
where
a
federal
court
specifically
addressed
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
ethical
opinions
promulgated
by
the
american
medical
association
are
enough
to
counterbalance
an
incentive
that
a
doctor
might
have
to
cut
care,
and
that
decision
i
cited
in
my...
i
believe
it
was
the
reply
at
the
writ
stage,
and
that
court
decided
that
the
ethical
opinions
aren't
enough
to
counterbalance
strong
financial
incentives,
and
therefore
we
can't
rely
on
the
physicians'
ethics
in
situations
like
this.
but
let
me
get
also
to
the
question
that
you
posed
concerning
why
should
you
get
involved.
this
court
in
varity
v.
howe
said
that
congress,
when
it
passed
erisa,
adopted
the
common
law
principles
of
trusts.
congress
didn't
specify
what
the
courts
were
supposed
to
do
in
each
and
every
case.
congress
said
that
the
courts
across
this
land
should
look
at
pension
benefit
funds,
or
pension
benefit
programs,
or
welfare,
health
care
programs,
applying
the
law
of
trusts,
and
try
to
determine,
using
the
principles
of
equity
under
the
law,
common
laws
of
trust,
what
is
acceptable
and
what's
not
acceptable.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
my
client
does
not
stand
to
profit
individually
or
personally
from
this
case.
what
we
are
seeking
is
to
recoup
the
bonuses
that
we
believe
are
paid
in
violation
of
fiduciary
duties
under
erisa.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
for
the
plan,
and
hopefully
a
couple
of
different
things
happen.
premiums
come
down
for
a
period
of
time,
or
coverage
is
broadened
for
a
period
of
time,
or
a
combination
of
the
two
for
a
period
of
time,
but
with
reference
to
a
broad
attack
on
managed
care,
that
can't
happen
under
erisa,
because
under
erisa
the
plaintiff
can
sue
only
on
behalf
of
the
plan,
unless
it's
a
denial
of
benefits,
and
then
you
get
the
cost
of
the
benefits
back,
but
under
no
circumstances
do
plaintiffs
get
compensation
for
pain
and
suffering,
mental
anguish,
and
there's
no
compensation
or
payment
for--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--to
the
risk
pools.
to
the
risk
pools.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
no,
on
behalf
of
the
plan.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
this
is
not
a
denial
of
benefits
case.
what--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--it's
not
a
denial
of
coverage
case.
that's
not
what
we're
alleging.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
the
benefits,
or
excuse
me,
the
expenses
that
were
incurred
for
her
hospitalization
and
emergency
surgery
were
paid
in
full.
we're
not
seeking
to
recover
those.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
no.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
no.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
this
is
not
a
medical
malpractice
case.
there
is
no
individually
named
physician
that's
a
defendant
in
amended
count
iii.
this
is
not
about
quality
of
care.
this
is
exclusively--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--it
would
go
back
into
the
risk
pools.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
if
i
can
go
back
to
the
analogies
example
that
i
was
trying
to
draw
previously,
say
you
have
somebody
in
relatively
good
health,
and
the
per
member
per
month
charge
for
the
cost
of--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--that's
plan
assets.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that's
a
plan
asset.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
it's
managed
by
the
hmo.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
well,
it
goes
back
into
the
risk
pool--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--but
it's
for
the
benefit,
for
the
health
benefit
of
the
participants,
as
opposed
to
being
available
for
bonuses
for
physicians.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
erisa
specifically
states
that
any
plan
participant
can
bring
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
plan.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
it's
not.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
case.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
the
harm
is
that
the
money
that
is
paid
into
the
risk
pool
by
state
farm
and
the
employee...
because
this
is
a
contributory
plan.
50
percent
of
the
premium
is
paid
by
the
employee.
the
harm
here
is
that
that
money,
which
is
supposed
to
be
used
exclusively
for
health
care,
is
not
being
used
exclusively
for
health
care.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
yes,
absolutely.
they
are
breaching
their
fiduciary
duties
with
respect
to
the
management
of
the
risk
pools.
the
risk
pools
have
exclusively
in
them
money
to
be
used
for
the
funding
of
medical
expenses.
and
you
asked
what
the
harm
is.
what
strikes
me
about
this
case,
unusual
about
this
case
is
that
the
courts
zealously
protect
money
for
money's
sake
with
respect
to
pension
plans,
and
let
me
explain
that.
if
you
look
at
the
john
hancock
v.
harris
trust
case
that
this
court
decided
in
1993,
or
some
other
cases
that
are
dealing
with
pension
benefits,
any
fiduciary
under
one
of
those
plans
has
never
been
able
to
deal
with
the
funds
in
that
plan
in
profit,
self-profit
from
the
dealing
of...
with
those
funds.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
yes.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
no,
you
do
not
make
that
assumption.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
we're
confusing
a
couple
of
two
different
issues,
because
there's
more
than
one
level
involved
in
this
case.
one
of
the
lower
levels
that
is
involved,
if
i
can
use
that
terminology,
is
the
determination
by
the
primary
care
physicians
as
to
what
is
and
what
is
not
medically
necessary.
that
not
only
is
a
treatment
decision,
but
based
upon
the
wording
of
this
plan,
it's
also
a
coverage
decision,
so--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--but
we're
not--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--no,
because
there
was
nothing
that
the
physician
felt
that
was
medically
necessary
that
was
denied.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
essentially
that's
correct,
judge.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that's
correct,
because--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--because--
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
--no.
we're
making
an
erisa
claim.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
it's
amended
count
iii.
that's
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that's
exactly
right,
judge.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
and
i
agree.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
i
agree.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
that's
going
to
be
a
difficult
line
to
draw.
it's
kind
of
like
the
line
that
the
court's
going
to
have
to
draw
with
respect
to
the
webster
hubbell
case
that
was
argued
yesterday.
it's
going
to
be
a
difficult
line
to
draw,
but
the
fact
that
it's
difficult
to
draw
doesn't
mean
we
don't
draw
it.
mr.
james
p.
ginzkey
the
phrase
that
i
have
used
is
undue
influence,
because
again,
drawing
on
the
study
from
california,
the
median
incentive
was
10,400,
but
some
of
those
incentives
got
up
to
40
to
50,000.
if
i'm
a
physician,
and
i
have
a
100,000
annual
salary
by
contract,
and
i've
got
two
kids
in
college,
and
i
can
make
another
50,000,
that's
a
lot
of
incentive.
that's
an
improper...
that's
an
undue
influence.
that's
an
improper
incentive.
