justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
whom
we
will
refer
--
i
am
sure
confusingly
to
you
at
the
moment
by
the
name
of
carle,
functioned
as
a
health
maintenance
organization
or
hmo
owned
by
physicians
and
providing
prepaid
medical
services.
the
respondent
cynthia
herdrich
was
enrolled
in
the
hmo
under
an
employee
medical
plan
and
she
sought
medical
care
for
abdominal
pain.
the
petitioner
lori
pegram
who
was
a
carle
physician,
made
her
herdrich
wait
for
eight
days
for
an
ultrasound
procedure
and
during
the
wait
herdrich’s
appendix
ruptured.
herdrich
sued
for
malpractice
and
fraud
in
state
court
but
ultimately
the
case
was
removed
to
federal
court.
in
federal
court
herdrich
made
a
new
claim
about
a
feature
of
the
hmo
scheme
that
rewarded
physicians
with
year-end
bonuses
based
on
their
collective
success
in
limiting
the
amount
of
care
dispensed.
she
said
that,
this
was
important
because
the
hmo
through
its
doctors
was
acting
as
a
fiduciary
within
the
meaning
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
or
erisa.
she
claimed
that
when
the
hmo
made
decisions
about
treatment
of
medical
plan
and
relieves,
such
decisions
violated
the
hmo’s
fiduciary
duty
because
of
the
year-end
bonus
provision
benefiting
its
physicians.
the
district
court
ultimately
dismissed
this
account
on
the
ground
that
carle
was
not
acting
as
an
erisa
fiduciary
when
it
made
these
decisions.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
dismissal
holding
that
herdrich
adequately
pleaded
the
breach
a
fiduciary
duty
by
carle
acting
as
an
erisa
fiduciary.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
conclude
that
congress
did
not
intend
an
hmo
to
be
treated
as
a
fiduciary
to
the
extent
that
it
makes
decisions
about
when
and
how
to
treat
and
enrollee
of
its
plan.
decision
with
medical
components
are
far
from
the
traditional
fiduciary
duties
with
which
congress
was
concern
in
erisa,
and
we
doubt
that
congress
intended
those
decisions
to
be
treated
as
fiduciary
acts.
our
doubt
hardens
into
conviction
when
we
consider
the
consequences
of
allowing
herdrich’s
claim
to
go
forward.
first,
if
such
treatment
decisions
subjected
hmos
to
sue
whenever
financial
considerations
ended
into
a
decision
for
profit
and
probably
nonprofit
hmos,
would
be
destroyed.
since,
the
entire
point
of
the
hmo
structure
is
to
inject
cost
consciousness
into
the
treatment
decisions.
without
more
specific
provision
from
congress
to
judiciary
we
think,
has
not
warrant
to
precipitate
such
an
appeal.
second,
even
if
we
accepted
the
seventh
circuit’s
attempt
to
limit
such
an
action
to
a
case
in
which
the
soul
purpose
of
denying
or
delaying
treatment
used
to
increase
physician
profits,
we
are
concerned
that
the
claims
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
would
in
fact
just
turn
into
the
equivalent
of
state
malpractice
claims.
for
reasons
given
in
the
opinion,
we
assure
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
turn
the
federal
courts
into
alternative
forms
for
all
examples
of
medical
malpractice
litigation.
