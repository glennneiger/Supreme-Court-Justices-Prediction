mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
our
position
that
the
treatment
allegations
of
the
complaint,
which
regard
the
incentive
to
the
physicians,
to
the
treating
physicians
concerning
their
treatment
of
their
patients,
are
governed...
essentially
state
claims
that
are
governed
by
state
law
but
are
not
governed
by
erisa
because
they
don't
have
to
do
with
fiduciary
duty
under
erisa.
on
the
other
hand,
the
administration
allegations
of
the
complaint,
if
there
are
any
there,
and
it's
unclear
to
me
whether
there
are
or
not,
but
insofar
as
the
complaint
is
alleging
that
there
was
deficiencies
that
have
to
do
with
the
claims
processing
function
of
the
hmo,
that
is
an
activity
that
is
governed
by
erisa
and
not
state
law.
however,
it's
our
position
that
they
did
not...
that
the
complaint
does
not
allege
a
violation
of
erisa's
fiduciary
duties
with
respect
to
those
issues.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
true.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
true,
but
insofar
as
the
fiduciary
is
someone...
it's
an
error
that
had
to
do
with
the
exercise
of
discretion
under
the
plan
in
deciding
what...
whether
a
certain
kind
of
procedure
is
covered,
then
it
would
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
i'm
not
sure
it
makes
that
much
difference,
because
if
it's
just
an
error
in
construing
the
plan,
the
claimant
would
have
a
claim
under
502(a)
for
the
benefit
that
was
due
in
any
event.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
discretion
in
this
sense
is
used
in
the
terms
of
applying
the
plan
terms
to
a
wide
variety,
sometimes
fairly
vague
plan
terms
to
a
wide
variety
of
different
cases,
and
that
does
have
something
in
common
with
what
judges
do,
and
judges
do
exercise
discretion
sometimes,
but
in
the
varity
corporation
v.
howe,
the
court
said...
i'm
reading
from
page
511,
516
u.s.
on
511...
a
plan
administrator
engages
in
a
fiduciary
act
when
making
discretionary
determination
about
whether
a
claimant
is
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
documents.
so
at
some
point
there
is
a
fiduciary,
and...
who...
where
that
person
has
some
discretion,
is
making
a
judgment
about
applying
some
broad
terms
to
maybe
a
particular
set
of
facts,
or
construing
what
the
terms
mean,
that
person
does
become
a
fiduciary
under
erisa.
now,
it's
our
position
that
a
doctor
doesn't
merely
by
accepting
a
patient
and
forming
a
doctor-patient
relationship.
within
a
doctor-patient
relationship,
as
it
has
long
been
understood,
the
doctor's
duties
are
governed
by
principles
of
medical
ethics
and
by
state
law,
and
erisa
basically
has
nothing
to
do
with
that,
whether
it's
provided
by
an
hmo
or
not.
but
where...
and
if...
and
in
this
case
that's
all
that
apparently
happened,
in
fact,
to
the
plaintiff,
but
where
there
is
a
claim
made,
not...
which
is
generally
not...
may
or
may
not
be
made
to
a
doctor,
it
may
be
some
other
functionary,
but
somebody
who's
not...
doesn't
have
a
doctor-patient
relationship
with
the
plaintiff,
if
a
claim
is
made
that
somebody
wants
something
covered,
that
triggers
the
claims
processing
function
of
the
plan
and
can
trigger
erisa's
fiduciary
duties.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
don't
think
that's
right.
they
have
to
faithfully
apply
the
terms
of
the
plan.
that's
their
primary
duty,
and
i
will
say
that...
well,
the
primary
duty
is
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
in
fact,
the
fiduciary
1104...
it's
capital
(d)
there,
i
think...
specifically
says
that
the
fiduciary
has
to
comply
with
the
plan
documents
and
with
the
plan--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
it's,
though...
i
think
the
sense
of,
in
the
interests
of
the
participant
or
the
beneficiary,
what
that
means
there
is
to
make
determinations
under...
as
to
what's
covered
and
what's
not
covered
in
accordance...
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
plan,
not
in
accordance
with
other
considerations
either
for
or
against
the
particular
individual,
because
that
beneficiary
doesn't
have
the
right
to
anything,
other
than
what
the
plan
document's
entitles
him
or
her
to.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
fact,
the
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
fact,
the
court
has
held,
i
think,
quite
to
the
contrary,
that
where
a
fiduciary
under
erisa
is
given
discretion
by
the
plan
to
make
those
kinds
of
determinations,
courts
will
accord
deference
to
the
discretion
given
to
the
fiduciary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--within
some
range
where
the
fiduciary
doesn't
have...
isn't...
the
plan
documents
don't
give
the
fiduciary
any
discretion
and
the
courts
don't
accord
it
and
will
decide
any
legal
suits
that
arise
from
it
based
just
on
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the...
it's...
there
are
certainly
many
circumstances
under
which
erisa
fiduciaries
do
have
a
duty
to
the
plan
as
a
whole,
where,
for
example,
they
are
sitting
on
a
trust,
on
some
assets.
how
they
spend
that...
which
does
not...
was
not
true
here.
how
they
spend
that
money,
they
have
a
duty
to
the
plan
and
to
all
of
the
beneficiaries
there,
but
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
a
claims
administrator
at
an
insurance
company
or
an
hmo,
their
duty
is
to
apply
the
plan
documents
to
this
individual
and
however
it
comes
out,
it
comes
out.
they
shouldn't
be
saying,
well,
i
don't
want
to
give
this
individual
benefits
because
it
might
somehow
save
money
for
the
employer
and
the
employer
might
therefore--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
you
know,
i
just
don't
think
that
that's
quite
right,
because
this
person,
fiduciary,
this
kind
of
limited
purpose
fiduciary...
it's
not
a
general
fiduciary
who's
a
trustee
of
the
plan,
but
it's
someone
who's
just
a
fiduciary
insofar
as
this
person
is
making...
is
ruling
on
a
claim
for
benefits.
this
person...
all
this
person
should
be
keeping
in
mind
is,
what
are
the
terms
of
the
plan,
and
how
does
that
apply
to
this
particular
claim.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
because
there's
a
contract
here
the
fiduciary
is
supposed
to
be
applying
that
contract
to
the
terms
of
this
claim,
and
whatever
it
permits--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
they
should
be
construing
them
in
a
reasonable,
consistent
way,
and
so
on,
not
always...
certainly
not
always
in
favor
of
the
beneficiary,
not
against
the
beneficiary.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's...
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
except--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--except--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--except
that
if
the
hmo...
as
far
as
the
treatment,
what
we
call
the
treatment
allocations--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
hmo
is
deciding
that
as
a
matter
of
how
to
pay
its
employees,
and
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
erisa
at
that
point.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
as
far
as
the
other
side--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--we're...
and
they
are
a
fiduciary
insofar
as
people
go
and
make
claims,
not
in
the
doctor-patient
relationship,
but
to
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
as
far
as
the
doctors
are
not.
now,
as
far
as
how
they
are
paying
the
people
who
are
making
the
claims,
when
the
claims
are
being
processed
it's
both
the
hmo
and
the
individual
who's
doing
it
who
become
fiduciaries...
who
become
fiduciaries
for
that
purpose,
and
insofar
as
they're
doing
that,
there
may
be
some
fiduciary
limits
that
erisa
places
on
the
kinds
of
incentive
structures.
we
gave
an
example
in
our
brief.
if
the
hmo
said
to
its
claims
people
something
which...
you
know,
i'm
not
suggesting
anybody
has
done
this,
but
we're
going
to
give
you
a
bounty
of
100
for
every
claim
you've
denied--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
would
raise
a
serious
problem.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
i
would...
our
position
is
that
the...
you
start
off
from
the
point
that
erisa
specifically
recognizes
that
benefits
can
be
provided
through
insurance
or
otherwise.
now,
an
insurer
is
always
in
a
position,
whenever
a
claim
is
made
against
an
insurance
policy,
just
like
an
hmo--
