justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
like--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
like
certiorari
denied.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
certiorari...
if
there's
been
a
denial,
can
you
go
back
to
the
appeals
council
and
ask
them
to
reconsider,
or
raise
any
new
points?
is
there--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what's
the
time
frame?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
you
ask
for
reopening
after
it's
gone
to
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
attorney
is
prepared
to
go
to
district
court
at
that
point,
having
received
a...
an
unfavorable
ruling,
what
would
be
wrong
with
just
saying
he
has
to
exhaust
by
asking
the
appeals
council
to
raise
any
specific
thing
that's
been
left
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
saying,
assuming
we
think
there's
an
exhaustion
rule,
since
there's
already
a
4-year
period
to
ask
the
agency
to
relook
at
it,
the
attorney,
before
he
goes
to
the
district
court,
says,
well,
i
want
to
give
the
appeals
council
first
crack
at
this,
so
he
just
reopens
and
says,
i
want
you
to
consider
a,
b,
and
c,
which
you
might
not
have
considered
earlier
in
my
three
line
letter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
appeals
council
already
has
an
exhaustion
concept
about
his
own
reopening,
doesn't
it,
based
on
what
you've
just
described?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
now
it
sounds,
as
i
said,
that
there
is
an
exhaustion
concept
that
the
appeals
council
itself
applies,
at
least
for
reopening,
based
on
what
you've
just
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
told
me
that
there's
no
reopening
unless
they've
overlooked
something
that
you
have
raised,
and
i
said,
that
sounds
to
me
like
exhaustion
in
the
present
system
that
the
appeals
council
already
follows.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
that
because
you're
here
we
can
presume
that
the...
this
rule
would
be
helpful
to
the
agency?
i
mean,
if
they
have
140,000
appeals
a
year,
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
some
of
these
reviewing
officials
have
said,
you
know,
i
don't
want
any
more
papers.
i
don't
want
elaborate
attorney
presentations,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
am
i
to
assess
that?
is
that
something
i
can
just
guess?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
indicated
toward
the
outset
of
your
remarks
that
there
are
some
issues
that
the
district
court
will
hear
that
the
alj
could
not
hear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
always
true
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
court
proceeding.
you
don't
know
what
the
error
is
until
the
decision
comes
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
government
is
just
thinking
how
long
it
takes
them
to
prepare
a
petition
for
certiorari,
i
think.
