justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
that
connection,
could
i
ask
just
a
factual
question?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
claimant
does
not
have
to
raise
the
issue
before
the
alj?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
the
most
consistent
system,
to
follow
justice
scalia's
thought,
would
be
one
that...
because
what's
being
reviewed
when
you
get
to
court
is
the
alj's
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
alj
commits
an
error
that
wasn't
even
talked
about
in
the
alj
proceeding,
if
the
claimant
is
smart
enough
to
raise
it
before
the
appeals
council,
the
alj
can
be
reversed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
the
principal
record
made?
is
there...
there's
a
record
made
of
the
alj's
proceeding,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is...
what
record
is
made
of
the
appeals
council
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
yet
that's
where
we
have
the
procedural
regularity,
before
the
appeals
council.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
the
experiment,
just
to...
in
that
experiment,
must
they
raise
the
issues
before
the
alj
as
a
predicate
to
raising
them
in
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
asking
what
we
said
in
richard.
what
are
they
doing
in
the
experiments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement
before
the
alj.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're,
of
course,
telling
us
something
dramatically
different
from
what
your
opponent
said.
i...
maybe
you're
right.
you
certainly
both
know
a
lot
more
about
it
than
i
do.
but
she
told
us
in
response
to
a
specific
question
by
me
that
in
the
appeals
council
there
was
no
exhaustion
requirement
whatsoever,
she
could
raise
anything
she
wanted
to,
and
you're
saying
that's
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
waiver
in
the
appeals
council?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
so
suppose
you
have
issue
a,
that
was
not
raised
before
the
alj,
but
was
raised
before
the
appeals
council.
can
that
issue
be
raised
in
the
district
court,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
the
appeals
council
does
discuss
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
no
waiver
rule
applied
to
the
alj.
the
waiver
rule
applies
only
at
the
appeals
council
level
and,
as
i
understand
it,
only
in
some
cases,
not
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
another
question.
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
claimant
was
represented
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
represented
by
whom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
anyone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
last
question,
and
i'll
leave
you
alone.
why
don't
they
spell
out
a
regulation
spelling
all
this
out
so
everybody
knows
exactly
what
the
rules
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
possibly
a
part
of
the
motivation
for
treating
claimants
represented
by
lawyers
less
favorably
than
those
on
their
own
is
to
discourage
lawyers
from
appearing?
because
if
i
remember
correctly,
years
ago
there
was
a
fee
limit
on
what
the
lawyers
could
collect,
wasn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
still
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
that
limit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
have
one
other
question.
in
normal
exhaustion
principles,
where
there
is
an
agency
exhaustion
requirement,
and
there's
a
failure
to
exhaust,
and
you're
in
the
district
court
reviewing
the
agency's
action,
or
the
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
agency
action,
if
there's
a
failure
to
exhaust,
does
the
article
iii
court
then
have
the
discretion
to
send
it
back
so
that
you
have
the
opportunity
to
exhaust,
or
is
there
always
a
waiver,
or
is
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
great
deal
written
about
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
have
the
same
scenario
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
when
it
reached
the
seventh
circuit
they
overruled
their
previous
cases,
unanimously,
en
banc.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
they
just
thought
the
whole
rule
was
not
authorized
by
any
regulation
or
anything
else,
and
it
didn't
make
any
sense.
that's
basically
what
they
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
one
question.
are
the
members
of
the
appeals
council
lawyers?
