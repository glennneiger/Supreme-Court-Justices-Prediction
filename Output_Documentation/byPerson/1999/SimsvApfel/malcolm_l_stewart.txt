mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
requirement
that
a
claimant
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
and
the
proposition
that
we
espouse
that
particular
issues
not
raised
at
the
appeals
council
should
ordinarily
be
deemed
waived,
are
technically
distinct,
but
they
serve
similar
purposes.
both
requirements
reflect
a
recognition
that
judicial
review
of
federal
agency
action
imposes
significant
costs
on
both
the
executive
branch
and
the
federal
courts,
and
those
costs
should
not
be
imposed
unless
it's
clearly
necessary,
and
in
particular,
courts
should
not
intrude
upon
agency
processes
until
the
agency
has
had
a
chance
to
take
its
best
shot
at
solving
the
problem
internally.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
characterization
of
agency
practice,
and
i
think
perhaps
it's
helpful
to
the
court
to
look
at
the
regulatory
provision
that
was
being
discussed.
it's
at
appendix
page
1
of
the
yellow
brief,
the
petitioner's
reply,
and
the
c.f.r.
cite
is
20
c.f.r.
404.970.
and
what
the
regulation
says,
it
says,
cases
the
appeals
council
will
review,
the
appeals
council
will
review
a
case
if,
and
then
it
lists
various
criteria
which
correspond
pretty
closely
to
the
normal
standards
for
appellate
review
or
of
judicial
review
of
agency
action,
and
i
think
our
interpretation
of
that
regulation
is
best
clarified
by
contrasting
it
with
this
court's
certiorari
practice.
that
is,
it's
often
said
that
the
supreme
court
is
not
a
court
of
error.
it
happens
frequently,
i
would
imagine,
that
cases
are
brought
before
the
court
on
certiorari
petitions,
and
even
though
a
majority
of
the
justices,
or
perhaps
even
all
the
justices,
believe
that
the
case
was
incorrectly
decided
below,
the
court
denies
certiorari
because
the
issue
raises
no...
the
case
raises
no
legal
issue
of
continuing
importance.
this
regulation
makes
clear
that
that's
not
the
way
the
appeals
council
approaches
its
business.
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
agency
is
currently
conducting
an
experiment
in
which,
in
selected
states,
we
will
dispense
with
the
requirement
that
the
claimant
seek
review
in
the
appeals
council
as
a
prerequisite
to
seeking
judicial
review,
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
that
experiment
is
to
determine
whether
the
elimination
of
that
stage
of
administrative
review
has
the
effect
of
increasing
the
rate
at
which
disappointed
claimants
file
suit
in
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
believe
it's
10
states,
and
i
believe
the
experiment
has
been
going
on
since
sometime
in
1997,
and
it
was
originally
characterized
as
a
3-year
experiment.
my
understanding
is
that
at
least
the
data
collection
phase
is
drawing
to
a
close,
although
there
may
be
an
evaluation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
would
be
directed
to
whether
the
requirement
of
going
to
the
appeals
council
at
all
should
be
eliminated.
again--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
it
varies
a
lot
depending
on
the
sort
of
issue
you've
raised,
you
want
to
raise.
in
richardson
v.
piralis,
for
instance,
this
court
recognized
that
where
a
particular
claim
is
capable
of
being
raised
before
the
alj,
a
claimant
may
be
barred
from
raising
it
in
court
thereafter,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
experiment
doesn't
change
the
ongoing
rules
in
that
respect.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
great
majority
of
claims
that
we
ultimately
see
in
court
are
claims
of
a
sort
that
really
could
not
feasibly
have
been
presented
to
the
alj,
because
they
were
claims
to
the
effect--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
a
lot
of
the
claims
that
we
get
in
court
are
claims
to
the
effect
that
the
alj
mislaid
the
evidence,
the
alj
failed
to
provide
a
sufficient
explanation
for
his
ruling
on
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
there
are
cases...
and
in
fact
the
district
court
did
something
similar
in
this
very
case.
that
is,
one
of
the
claims
the
petitioner
raised
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
alj
had
posed
a
defective
hypothetical
to
the
vocational
expert.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
is
correct
that
if
the
claim
was
susceptible
of
being
raised
before
the
alj,
it
should
be
raised
before
the
alj
or
it
will
be
deemed
waived.
the
only
point
i'm
making
is,
in
our
experience
we
see
a
very
substantial
number
of
claims
that
couldn't
feasibly
have
been
raised
before
the
alj
because
they
are
in
terms
a
tax
on
what
the
alj--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
no,
i
don't
doubt
that
she
can
raise
it
before
the
appeals
council.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i've
never
seen
an
appeals--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
if
the
appeals
council
does
not
discuss
it.
if
the
appeals--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
the
appeals
council
discusses
it,
it's
similar,
we
would
submit,
to
the
pressed
or
passed
upon
below
rule
that
this
court
invokes.
that
is,
on
review
of
a
state
supreme
court,
even
if
a
party--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
is...
no,
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
pressed
or
passed
on
below
rule.
the
basic
waiver
rule
is,
if
you
don't...
if
it
was
capable
of
being
raised
before
the
appeals
council,
and
you
don't
raise
it
there,
then
you're
waived
from
raising
it
after
that,
but
i
think,
consistent
with
this
court's
pressed
or
passed
upon
below
jurisprudence,
even
if
the
claim
was
not
pressed
below,
if
it
was
passed
upon
by
the
appeals
council--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we...
our...
ssa's
policy
has
been
to
invoke
the
administrative
default
principle
only
with
respect
to
claimants
who
were
represented
before
the
appeals
council.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
represented
either
by
an
attorney
or
by
a
nonattorney.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
large
majority
of
people
who
are
represented
are
represented
by
attorneys,
and
this,
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
the
court
need
decide
nothing
more
than
that
when
there
was
an
attorney
representing
the
claimant--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
part
of
it
is
perhaps
suggested
by
a
question
that
justice
scalia
asked,
that
there
is
something,
perhaps
not
improper,
but
inherently
problematic
about
an
agency
promulgating
a
regulation
that
purports
to
tell
district
courts
how
they're
supposed
to
conduct
their
review.
the
agency
can
have
a
position
on--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
you're
right
that
there
are
agencies
who
have
perhaps
more
precise
regulations
as
to
what
the
request
for
an
administrative
appeal
is
supposed
to
look
like.
my
point
was
that
none
of
the
regulations
that
are
cited
by
the
petitioner,
and
no
regulation
that
i'm
aware
of,
purports
to
describe
what
the
consequences
will
be
on
judicial
review
of
the
failure--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
could
be
done
by
regulation.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
the
agency's
current
intention,
again,
if
the
court
holds
that
it
is
entitled
to
invoke
administrative
default
principles,
would
be
to
revise
the
forms
that
are
provided
to
claimant's
representatives
in
order
to
alert
them
to
the
prospect
that
issues
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
doubt
that
that
could
have
been
done,
and
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
10
minutes
is
more
the
ministerial
act
of
actually
filling
out
the
form,
of
writing
the
words
down.
it
clearly
wouldn't
encompass
the
stage
of
reading
and
assimilating
the
alj's
decision,
deciding
whether
an
appeal
is
worth
taking,
and
then
deciding
what
issues
should
be
raised.
but
i
think
a
couple
of
points
i
would
make,
there's
no
question
that
the
agency
could
have
stated
these
potential
consequences
more
clearly,
but
i
think
the
questions
for
this
court
are,
first,
is
the
administrative
default
rule
a
good
rule
going
forward
and,
second,
if
it's
a
good
rule
going
forward,
is
there
any
equitable
basis
for
not
applying
the
rule
to
that...
this
case?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it's
accurate
to
say
that
the
appeals
council,
within
the
time
constraints,
which
are
very
substantial,
will
look
beyond
the
particular
claims
of
error
that
claimant's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
theoretically
the
appeals
council
will
look
at
the
record
to
the
extent
that
time
permits,
but
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
limitation
of
issues
regulation
is
addressed
more
specifically
to
the
class
of
cases
in
which
the
appeals
council
grants
review
but
then
requests
further
submissions
by
the
parties,
much
as
this
court
might
grant
certiorari
and
then
request--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
best
indication
i
would
have
is
that
not
every
regulation
is
reprinted
here,
and
if
you
look
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
and
view
them
sequentially,
this
comes
after
the
regulation
that
deals
with
the
circumstances
under
which
the
appeals
council
will
grant
review.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
on
review,
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
i...
we
would
disagree
with
the
suggestion
that
it
is...
that
that
duty
is
imposed
by
regulation,
or
that
it
in
any
way
follows
from
the
duty
to
conduct
review.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
in
a
sense
the
notion
that
the
claimant
or
the
attorney
would
have
that
conception
of
the
appeals
council
process
is
really
inconsistent
with
the
basic
premise
of
hiring
an
attorney
to
represent
you.
that
is,
ms.
sims
retained
counsel,
presumably
contemplated
that
he
would
be
paid
in
the
event
that
the
outcome
was
successful,
and
mr.
parvin,
who
was
the
attorney
at
that
time,
accepted
the
representation
on
that
understanding.
it
would
have
made--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and
all
of
this
goes
to
agency
practice
in
arguing
before
the
courts.
that
is,
even
as
to
unrepresented
claimants
the
final
determination
would
be
made
to
the
court
as
to
whether
claims
not
raised
before
the
appeals
council
would
be
waived.
the
social
security
administration
would
simply
be
making
clear
its
view
as
to
what
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--most
conducive
to
the
fair
operation
of
the
system,
but
if
i
could
return
to
this
point
just
for
a
second
about
representation
by
an
attorney,
it
would
make
no
sense
for
a
claimant
to
hire
an
attorney,
to
agree
to
pay
him
a
portion
of
any
recovery,
and
for
the
attorney
to
accept
that
representation
agreement,
if
the
supposition
was
that
the
appeals
council
was
to
perform
precisely
the
same
mode
of
review
no
matter
what
the
content
of
the
challenge
was.
the
whole
point
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
that's
really
precisely
our
point,
that
the
fact
that
the
social
security
administration
will
typically
go
beyond
the
claims
raised
in
the
request
for
review
and
will
look
at
other
parts
of
the
record
to
determine
whether
there
was
an
error
doesn't
vitiate
the
fact
that
the
appeals
council
is
assisted
enormously
by
submissions
that
draw
its
attention.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
fee...
there
is
a
fee
limit
on
what
lawyers
can
collect
for
representation
of
claimants
before
the
agency.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
believe
that
it's
typically
$4,000
or
a
quarter
of
the
past
due
benefits.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
the
fee
for
the
administrative
process
is
not
paid
by
the
agency.
the
agency
monitors
the
system
and
must
pass
on
fee
requests,
but
the
fee
is
paid
by
the
claimant,
so
the
agency
doesn't
have
a
financial
incentive
to
reduce
the
extent
of
lawyer
representation.
now--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
scheme
is
certainly
such
that
if
a
claimant
believed
that
the
appeals
council
would
provide
precisely
the
same
mode
of
review
regardless
of
the
content
of
the
request,
then
you're
correct,
the
claimant
would
have
no
incentive
to
retain
a
lawyer.
i
think
the
incentive
is
that
people
understand
that's
not
the
way
the
system
operates,
that
even
though
the
appeals
council
will
look
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
request
for
review,
it
is
still
much
more
likely
to
act
favorably
if
the
request
for
review
precisely
identifies
the
purported
errors.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the...
in
the
past
fiscal
year
they
granted
review
in
approximately
24
percent
of
the
cases.
around
2
percent
there
was
an
outright
reversal,
an
award
of
benefits,
and
in
the
other
22
percent
the
cases
were
remanded
to
the
alj.
but
just
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
significance
of
that
figure,
the
total
number
of
cases
in
which
a
wholly
or
partially
favorable
decision
was
issued
was
over
20,000
cases,
and
the
number
of
new
ssi
and
disability
insurance
cases
that
were
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
during
the
equivalent
period
was
a
little
over
13,000
cases,
still--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
you
are
correct
in
saying
the
fact
that
we
are
here
defending
this
proposition
indicates
that
the
agency
has
concluded
that
on
the
whole,
the
benefits
of
this
rule
outweigh
the
costs.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
may
be
that
in
some
instances
this
will
cause
the
filing
of
over
long
requests
for
review
in
the
appeals
council,
but
on
the
whole,
we
think
that
if
claimants
more
precisely
identified
the
weaknesses
in
the
alj's
decision,
that
the
agency's
mission
will
be
furthered.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
there
are
a
couple
of
different
permutations
of
that.
one
would
be,
if
the
claim
was
the
alj's
opinion
reflected
an
erroneous
legal
premise,
or
the
alj
in
his
opinion...
and
this
was
the
primary
claim
made
here...
the
alj
in
his
opinion
ignored
much
of
the
documentary
evidence
that
i
had
submitted
without
good
reason,
that
is
a
claim
that
by
its
nature
couldn't
be
presented
to
the
alj
because
you
don't
know
until
the
alj
issues
its
ruling
what
weight
it's
attached
to
particular
evidence.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
probably
a...
more
social
security
cases
than
cases
generally
turn
on
questions
of
assessment
of
the
evidence
and
less
on
questions
of
abstract
principles
of
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
absolutely
correct,
and
that
would
be
true
of
the
appeals
council
as
well,
because
the
appeals
council
is
not
a
policy
making
body.
its
duty
is
to
apply
established
ssa
policy
to
individual
cases,
and
so
a
claim,
for
instance,
that
the
regulation
was
violative
of
a
statute,
or
the
statute
was
violative
of
the
constitution,
couldn't
be
presented
either
to
the
alj
or
the
appeals
council.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there's
not
a
great
deal
written
about
this,
although
the
bulk
of
the
cases,
or
really
all
of
the
court
of
appeal
cases
that
i
have
seen
that
have
applied
the
rule
that
claims
not
raised
before
the
agency
will
thereafter
be
deemed
waived,
have
simply
ignored
or
dismissed
the
claim
once
it
was
raised.
that
is,
presumably
if
you
had
a
good
reason
for
not
raising
the
claim
before
the
agency,
the
court
would
then
consider
it
on
the
merits,
but
if
you
didn't
have
a
good
reason
for
not
raising
it,
the
court
typically
wouldn't
remand
to
the
agency
to
give
you
a
second
shot.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
certainly
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
entertain
the
question,
was
there
a
good
reason
for
not
raising
this
before
the
agency,
but
i
think
here,
the
question
would
have
to
be
answered
in
the
negative,
because
on
top
of
everything
else,
not
only
was
the
claimant
represented
by
counsel,
but
there
was
a
published
opinion
within
the
fifth
circuit
some
18
months
previously
that
had
said
in
the
clearest
possible
language,
issues
not
raised
before
the
appeals
council,
absent
extraordinary
circumstances,
can't
be
raised
in
court.
so
i
think
perhaps
for
that
reason
the
petitioner
didn't
attempt
to
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
yes,
there
would
ordinarily
be
a
waiver
principle,
but
it
was
inapplicable
here
for
good
cause.
rather,
the
petitioner
argued
that
there
was
not
properly--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
overruled
them,
but
they
certainly
didn't...
i
don't
think
they
could
reasonably
have
overruled
them
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
lack
of
notice.
if
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
thought
it
was
inconsistent
with
the...
i
mean,
they
made
an
argument
much
like
petitioner
is
making--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
manner
in
which
the
appeals
council
operates.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
and
i
think
you
are
correct
that
that
is
an
inevitable
cost
of
default
rules
in
any
context,
whether
it
be
administrative
default,
default
issues
that
are
not...
issues
not
raised
before
the
district
court
are
waived
on
appeal,
habeas,
there
are
a
lot
of
situations
in
which
in
particular
cases
the
inquiry
into
whether
a
particular
claim
was
in
fact
preserved
may
be
more
complicated
than
an
inquiry
into
the
merits
of
the
claim.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
agree
that
that
is
a
possible
outcome,
but
i
think
when
we
argue
for
administrative
default
in
these
cases
our
purpose
is
not
to
get
the
individual
claim
kicked
out
of
court.
our
hope
is
that
once
these
principles
become
established,
claimants
and
their
representatives
will
realize
that
in
order
to
preserve
claims
for
judicial
review
they
must
be
raised
before
the
agency,
and
the
appeals
council
will
be
given
a
better
opportunity
to
fix
mistakes
in
a
way
that
avoids
the
need
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--definitely
the
agency
has
committed
to
revising
the
form,
pending
the
determination
by
this
court.
obviously,
if
this
court
held
that
the
agency
was
not
entitled
to
invoke
administrative
default
principles,
notice
or
no
notice,
we
wouldn't
be
advising
claimants
that
the
administrative
default
rule
might
apply.
but
if
the
court
holds
that
this
is
a
permissible
rule
in
social
security
cases,
the
agency
has
committed
to
revising
the
form
in
order
to
make--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
form
that
would
be
sent
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
is
partly
in
order
to
avoid
claims
being
kicked
out
unnecessarily,
or
perhaps
a
better
answer
would
be,
the
agency
as
well
as
the
courts
benefit
if
claims
are
made
clear
to
the
appeals
council,
that
the
appeals
council
is
given
the
best
possible
opportunity
to
fix
mistakes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
only
reason
to
wait
on
the
court
is
that,
if
we
started
up
the
machinery
for
printing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
forms
that
said,
if
you
don't
raise
these
claims
they
may
be
barred
in
court,
and
then
the
court
3
months
later
came
out
with
a
decision
that
said,
we
find
this
sort
of
rule
to
be
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
the
appeals
council
and
therefore
it's
impermissible,
questions
of
notice
to
one
side,
the
agency
obviously
couldn't
advise
claimants
that
they
might
be
subject
to
a
consequence
that
the
court
had
just
said
they
wouldn't
be
subject
to.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
believe
some
are
lawyers
and
some
are
not
lawyers.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
correct,
and
in
a
certain
category
of
cases
the
appeals
council
will
remand
the
case
to
the
alj
for
further
explanation
or
clarification
of
the
opinion,
and
sometimes
the
alj
will
adhere
to
the
unfavorable
benefits
determination,
but
will
offer
a
more
persuasive
explanation
for
that
finding,
and
even
if
the
case
winds
up
in
court,
that
effort
was
not
wasted.
it
ensures
that
the
court
is
reviewing
what
is
really
the
commissioner's
best
articulation
of
his
final
decision.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it's
something
of
an
overstatement
to
say
the
appeals
council
doesn't
follow
case...
can't
look
at
case
law.
the
appeals
council
is
bound
by
ssa
policy,
and
the
appeals
council
cannot
use
a
published
decision
as
a
justification
for
deviating
from
established
ssa
policy.
it
has
to
wait
for
the
policy
itself
to
change.
but
if
there
is
a
question
that
is
not
controlled
by
any
specific
published
ssa
policy,
the
appeals
council
can
look
to
case
law
to
clarify
that.
