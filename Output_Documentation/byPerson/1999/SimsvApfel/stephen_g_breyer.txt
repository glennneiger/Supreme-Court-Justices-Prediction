justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
it
doesn't?
i
mean,
the
normal
hornbook
administrative
law
is
just
the
same
as
for
a
district
court
and
a
court
of
appeals.
if
you
don't
raise
an
issue,
you
lose
it.
now,
there
can
be
exceptions
to
that,
but
i
mean,
unless
there's
something
that
says
there's
an
exception,
i
don't
know
why
we'd
assume
there
was
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
not
an
agency
follows
it.
to
my
knowledge,
that
is
the
uniform
practice
of
the
united
states
courts.
you
raise
an
issue,
or
you
lose
it,
with
exceptions.
with
exceptions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
just
saying
i
never
saw
a
case
that
didn't
follow
that
rule,
and
then
what
they
usually
argue
about
is
whether
there's
an
exception,
and
there
are
many.
so
i
just
wondered
what
there
was
here
that
would
say...
there
may
be
many
things
that
would
take
you
out
of
what
i'd
call
the
hornbook
rule,
or
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
the
hornbook
rule.
i'm
just
saying,
i
thought
that's
what
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why?
that's
exactly
what
i...
i'm
glad...
thank
you
for
getting
into
this,
because
that's...
why
does
the
fact
that
it's
informal
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
it's
all
the
more
reason
to
bring
up
the
things,
or
it's
at
least
no
less
of
a
reason,
so
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
that
could
say,
let's
bring
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we'll
actually
get
the
lawyers
out
of
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
absolutely
agree
with
you
that
there
is
that
difference.
and
now
what
my
question
is,
is
why
should
that
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
whether
you'd
have
to
bring
it
up
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
in
the
notice
that
they
gave
you,
i
take
it,
you
have
a
right...
not
you,
but
your
client,
if
you
do
not
agree
with
the
alj's
decision,
you
may
file
an
appeal
with
the
appeals
council.
if
you
do
not
appeal,
and
the
council
does
not
review
the
alj's
decision
on
its
own,
you
will
not
have
a
right
to
court
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
a
lawyer
receives
that.
now,
when
a
lawyer
receives
that,
i
think
that
lawyer
would
know,
i
better
appeal
it
if
i
want
to
go
to
court,
and
if
a
lawyer...
you
know,
had
a...
a
lawyer
who
knows
the
basic
ground
rules
i
think
might
also
think,
i
better
raise
the
issues.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is...
i
don't
understand
this.
i
may
be
missing
something
fundamental.
i
thought
the
rule
was
you
do
have
to
raise
your
claims
before
the
alj.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unless
you
fall
within
some
kind
of
exception.
for
example,
you're
making
a
claim
on
an
interpretation
of
law
that
the
alj
wouldn't
have
the
power
to
resolve.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously
you
can't
raise
a
claim
before
the
alj
that
the
alj
made
a
mistake,
but
you
have
to
raise
the
claim
before
the
alj
that
the
evidence
entitles
me
to
a
victory,
and
then
you
say
he
made
a
mistake,
because
he
thought
it
entitled
me
to
a
defeat.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
basic
rule...
i
mean,
i've
seen...
it
seems
to
me
from
my
own
experience,
which
might
not
be
typical,
is
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
claims
where
people
come
into
federal
court,
and
what
they
say,
basically,
is
i
did
have
a
bad
back,
i
did
have
in
combination
with
my
physical,
other
physical
disabilities
and
mental,
sometimes
mental
problems,
sufficient
to
overcome
the
grid,
and
they
should
have
done
it
on
the
grid,
or
they
should
have
done
it
in
some
other
way,
hundreds
of
cases
like
that.
now,
i
thought...
or
thousands,
and
i
thought
in
all
of
those
cases
the
basic
claim
of
evidence
and
so
forth
had
to
be
raised
before
the
alj.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
you...
in
the
form
that
you
have,
it
says,
i
request
that
the
appeals
council
review
the
administrative
law
judge's
action
on
the
above
claim
because.
now,
why
couldn't
you
just
put,
parenthesis,
please
list
all
your
reasons,
for
if
you
don't,
you
may
find...
you
may
find...
that
you
can't
raise
them
later
in
a
court
review?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
moreover
on
the
next
page,
not
on...
they
didn't
do
that,
but
the
next
page
it
happens
to
say,
we
estimate
it
will
take
you
about
10
minutes
to
complete
this
form,
so
i
imagine
that
somebody
reading
that
might
think,
gee,
i
don't...
i
have
a
million
reasons
why
the
alj
was
wrong.
minimum,
my
lawyer
just
says
list
the
top
five,
but
i
certainly
can't
do
it
in
5
minutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
10
minutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
mr.
stewart,
doesn't
the
appeals...
don't
the
regs
in
effect
warrant
that
the
appeals
council
will
look
at
everything?
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
dispositive.
i'm
looking
on
the
reg
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
of
the
blue
brief,
404-976.
the
appeals
council
may
limit
the
issues
it
considers
if
it
notifies
you
and
the
other
parties
of
the
issues
it
will
review,
which
suggests
to
me
that
unless
the
appeals
council
negates
issues,
it
is,
in
fact,
warranting
that
it
will
look
at
everything,
so
that
when
you
come
to
apply
the
pressed
or
passed
upon
rule,
it's
fair
to
say,
well,
they
passed
upon
absolutely
everything
that
they
didn't
specifically
exclude.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
know
that?
i
certainly
don't
know
my
way
through
these
regs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
as
far
as
exhaustion
is
concerned
nobody's
ever...
i
mean,
the
point
you
just
made
has
nothing
to
do
with
exhaustion.
as
justice
kennedy
just
said,
in
a
district
court,
we
look
to
see
whether
he
presented
the
basic
arguments
pro
and
con
in
respect
to
the
district
judge.
we
don't...
the
fact
that
we
couldn't
know
what
the
district
judge's
decision
would
be
at
the
time
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
kind
of
thing
i
think
you
would
say
normally
you
don't
have
to
present
to
the
alj,
is
a
claim
that,
for
example,
this
regulation
that
you're
following
is
contrary
to
the
statute,
or
the...
a
statute
is
contrary
to
the
constitution,
something
that
there
would
be
a
principle
within
the
agency
that
he's
not
supposed
to
make
that
decision.
that's
my
understanding,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
you
had
a
good
reason.
i
mean,
i
thought
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
discretion
in
this
area,
such
that
it's
exactly
the
same
as
when
a
case
comes
up
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
court.
maybe
there's
a
reason
why
she
didn't
raise
it,
in
which
case
you
could
send
it
back,
or
maybe
even
excuse
it.
and
here,
where
she's
pushing...
your
opponent
is
pushing
the
following
reason.
go
read
the
forms
and
read
the
10
minutes
and
so
forth,
and
note
the
nature
of
the
appeals
council,
and
a
lawyer
might
reasonably
think
i
don't
have
to.
there
wasn't
good
notice
about
what
i
was
supposed
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
that
they...
is
that
if
you
allow
people
to
avoid
exhaustion
in
several
thousand
cases
every
year,
and
many
more,
possibly,
people
will
then
go
in
and
go
to
court,
and
they'll
just
think
of
a
whole
lot
of
reasons
that
they
never
raised
before,
and
the
judges
are
busy,
and
magistrates
are
busy,
and
to
have
all
these
new
reasons
hitting
them
that
nobody's
even
looked
at
or
thought
about
is...
just
adds
to
the
work
unnecessarily.
that's
the
traditional
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
they
resolve
problems.
in
20,000
cases
every
year
they
resolve
them,
and
those
are
20,000
cases
that
the
courts
never
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
it's...
it
is
the
basic
background
law,
and
there's
no
need
for
it,
but
maybe
their
form
isn't
good
enough
in
explaining
it.
