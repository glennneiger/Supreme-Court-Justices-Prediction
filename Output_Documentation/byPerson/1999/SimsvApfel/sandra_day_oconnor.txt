--were
you
the
counsel
below--
justice

--ms.
bohr,
at
the
appeals
council
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
it
be
helpful
to
raise
issues
that
the
claimant
thinks
are
important
before
the
appeals
council?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
strikes
me
as
rather
odd
that
the
claimant
wouldn't
want
to
raise
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some,
but
apparently
never
claimed
that
the
administrative
law
judge
should
have
ordered
a
consultative
examination.
that
was
never
raised--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--anywhere
down
the
line
until
the
district
court,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it's
so
odd
that
the
agency
that
wants
to
take
the
position
that
the
issues
should
be
at
least
mentioned
in
writing
the
appeals
council
seeking
review...
i
mean,
it
could
do
that
without
specifying
what
happens
at
the
district
court
level...
and
say,
as
a
claimant,
you
should
set
out
the
issues
that
you
want
the
council
to
review,
otherwise
it
won't
review
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
could
be
done,
couldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
agency
could
say,
and
we
have
a
different
rule
if
you're
not
represented.
but
to
have
this
vague
understanding
is
quite
peculiar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
--well,
let
me
ask
this.
is
it
true
that
the
appeals
council
reviews
the
whole
record
for
any
conceivable
error,
whether
or
not
it's
been
listed
by
the
claimant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
a
claimant
could
submit
an
appeal
without
specifying
any
grounds,
and
theoretically
the
appeals
council
will
look
at
the
whole
record.
