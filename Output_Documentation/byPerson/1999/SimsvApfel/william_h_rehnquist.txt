chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-9537,
juatassa
sims
v.
apfel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
doesn't
help
you
i
don't
think,
ms.
bohr,
because
we're
talking
here
about
whether
you
have
to
raise
it
before
the
appeals
council.
granted,
you
can
take
anything
that
happened
before,
before
the
appeals
council.
we're
talking
about
whether
you
can
take
something
that
you
didn't
take
to
the
appeals
council
to
the
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
don't
you
have
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
bohr,
it's
also
very...
it's
to
help
the
agency
i
think,
to
let
them
correct
a
mistake,
and
it
will
be
much
easier
for
them
to
correct
it
if
it's
called
to
their
attention
than
if
it's
not,
if
they're
simply
bypassed
and
it's
raised
for
the
first
time
in
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
has
set
up...
it
has
set
up
a
system
like
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
review...
but
provide...
review
in
the
appeals
council
is
plenary.
don't...
nothing
here
suggests
that
they're
treating
it
otherwise.
they're
not
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
must
have
raised
an
issue
before
you
get
to
the
appeals
council
in
order
to
get
it...
in
order
to
bring
it
to
the
appeals
council.
what
they're
saying
is,
you
have
to
have
raised
it
in
the
appeals
council
before
you
can
go
into
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is
the
point
of
requiring
you
to
go
to
the
appeals
council,
as
you
concede
they
do,
if
you
don't
have
to
raise
issues
there
that
you
later
want
to
take
to
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
are
you
saying,
ms.
bohr,
that
if
the
agency
were
simply
to
adopt
a
rule
that
you
must
exhaust
your
issues
before
the
appeals
council
in
order
to
raise
them
in
court,
that
would
suffice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
i
asked
you
a
rather
specific
question.
i
think
it
can
be
answered
yes
or
no
and
then
explain
if
you
want
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
little
more
detail
on
that,
ms.
bohr.
when
you
want
to
take
a
case
from
the
alj
to
the
appeals
council,
you
have
to
file
some
sort
of
piece
of
paper,
i
assume,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then,
do
you
get
a
decision
from
the
appeals
council?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay...
now,
what
if
the
appeals
council
grants
your...
grants
you
review,
and
rules
in
your
favor?
obviously
they
don't
send
this
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
bohr.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
the
experiment...
is
it
directed
to
eliminate
the
requirement
of
going
to
the
appeals
council
at
all,
or
just
to
eliminating
the
requirement
that
you
raise
issues
before
the
appeals
council?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
used
to
be
$10
when
i
practiced.
[laughter]
and
you
couldn't
get
a
percentage,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
ms.
bohr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
case
was
a
social
security
case.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
bohr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
