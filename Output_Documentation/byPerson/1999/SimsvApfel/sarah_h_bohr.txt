ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
held
that
social
security
proceedings
are
intended
to
be
simple
and
informal,
nonadversarial,
nontechnical,
and
accessible
even
to
the
layman
claimant.
indeed,
almost
half
of
all
claimants
who
attend
social
security
administrative
hearings
do
not
have
attorney
representation.
this
court
also
noted
that
the
social
security
act
is
intended
to
be
unusually
protective
of
claimants.
consistent
with
congressional
intent,
the
social
security
administration
has
promulgated
and
created
a
panoply
of
regulations,
rules,
forms,
and
notices
which
embody
that
simplicity,
that
informality,
and
that
claimant
supportive
process
mandated
by
congress.
as
conceded
by
the
commissioner,
the
statute
and
regulations
do
not
require
that
claimant
specifically
delineate
any
claims
of
error
or
specific
issues
when
seeking
review
by
the
appeals
council
from
an
administrative
law
judge
decision.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
the
form
in
question
contains
three
lines
of
space,
and
it
states,
my
reasons
for
disagreement
are.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
it
doesn't
state
any
warning
on
it
that
you
must
list
specific
issues.
there's
nothing
in
the
notice
of
decision
that
is
sent
to
the
claimant
when
a
claim
is
denied
that
warns
the
claimant
that
if
they
do
not
delineate
specific
issues
in
their
appeal
they
will
waive
that
right
in
federal
court
and,
in
fact,
significantly,
justice
scalia,
the
notice
of
decision,
the
one
issued
in
this
case,
contains
many
other
warnings.
it
warns
a
claimant
that
if
they
file
a
new
application
it's
not
the
same
thing
as
appealing.
they
lose...
they
may
lose
benefits.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes,
she
was.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
your
honor,
in
social
security
proceedings
the
scheme
is
different.
we
have
set
up
a
very...
congress
has
established
an
informal,
nonadversarial
system
of
decisionmaking.
social
security's
own
regulations
and
rules
do
not
require
that
a
claimant
specify
issues.
in
fact,
the
regulations
provide
that
the
review
is
plenary,
meaning
that
all
issues
are
before
the
appeals
council
unless
the
appeals
council
notifies
the
claimant
that
they
intend
to
limit
the
issues,
so
the
regulations--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--provide
for
a
plenary
review.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
not
at
the
appeals
council
level.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
no,
we
were
not.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
well,
certainly--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--well,
certainly
in
this
case
the
record
does
reflect
that
ms.
sims'
counsel
raised
many
matters
in
her...
in
the
appeal,
but--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--no,
it
was
not.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
no,
it
was
not.
i
think
certainly
it
can
assist
the
process
for
claims
to
identify
issues,
and
they
do.
most
claimants
list
some
kind
of
issues
in
support
of
their
appeal.
the
problem
is
that
we
have
a
scheme
that
doesn't
require
that.
it
doesn't
require
that.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
that
is
certainly
a
rule,
and
many
agencies
follow
that
rule--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--but
you
have
to
look
at
what
are
the
prudential
considerations
for
the
application
of
common
law
issues
of
exhaustion,
which
is
what
you're
describing.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
the
hornbook
rule
you're
referring
about
is
the...
is
a
rule
that
claimants
may
be
required
to
list
issues,
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
statutory
scheme
we're
talking
about.
you
can't
just
look
at
these
things
in
a
vacuum,
and
congress,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
mccarthy
v.
madigan
case
and
the
darby
v.
cisneros
case,
you
have
to
look
with
consistency
with
the
actual
underlying
congressional
intent,
and
any
applicable
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme,
in
determining
whether
exhaustion
should
be
required
at
all,
and
issue
exhaustion
is
part
of
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
and
courts
have
also
set
forth
certain
exceptions
from
that
rule,
and
they
should
not
be
applied,
though,
blindly.
you
have
to
look
at
whether
the
prudential
considerations
are
served,
and
the
two
primary
ones
identified
in
the
mccarthy
v.
madigan
case
were
protection
of
agency
autonomy
and
also
judicial
economy.
those
were
the
two
reasons
why
you
would
require
someone
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
now,
in
this
context
we
submit
that
those
purposes
are
simply
not
served,
because
you
have
an
agency
that
specifically
talks
about
its
proceedings
are
informal,
they're
nontechnical,
they're...
they
are
claimant
supported,
you
have
a
process
that
doesn't
advise
you--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--it's
a
combination
of
being
informal,
being
simple,
being
nonadversarial,
being--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--all
those
factors
make
a
difference.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
it's
a
very
unique
process.
social
security
cases
are
not
like
other
agencies.
we're
not
talking
about
agencies
where
people
come
to
hearings
and
they
have...
there's
parties
on
both
sides
with
attorneys.
a
social
security
hearing
is
very
informal.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
because
it
makes
a
difference
in
terms
of
how
the
agency
announces...
the
agency
has,
as
i
said
earlier,
a
whole
panoply
of
regulations,
rules,
forms,
and
notices,
and
all
those--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--but
they
haven't
changed
it.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
your
honor,
when
you
appeal
a
case
to
the
appeals
council,
the...
i
think
it's
significant
that
they
don't
advise
people
that
you
have
to
raise
issues.
you
look
at
the
veterans
administration,
which
is
a
similar
kind
of
agency
like
social
security--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--well,
first
of
all,
in
the
social
security
context,
when
the
appeals
council
denies
review,
it's
the
alj
decision
that
goes
into
federal
court,
not
the
appeals
council
denial.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
certainly.
there
is
a
point
that
we
concede
that
the
informal,
nonadversarial,
claimant
driven
process
changes
to
a
more
formal
setting,
and
we
contend
that
the
way
this
scheme
is
currently
set
up,
that
point
happens
in
federal
court.
when
you
file
a
claim
in
federal
court,
despite
the
fact
that
we
have
a
very
simple
kind
of
system
for
claimants,
when
you
get
to
federal
court
you
have
to
raise
all
your
issues.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
it
is
the
fourth
rung.
you
apply
initially,
there
is
a
decision
made,
then
the
claimant
requests
reconsideration,
then,
if
they're
dissatisfied,
the
third
step
is
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge,
and
then
if
they're
denied
they
must
go
through
the
fourth
rung,
which
is
the
appeals
council.
now,
this
is
a
huge
number
of
claims.
115,000
cases
are
filed
there
in
the
last
fiscal
year,
and
they
have
just
20
judges,
and
there
is
information
we
provided
in
our
brief
that
there
have
been
studies
done
which
show
that
the
average
judge
spends
15
minutes
looking
at
a
claim,
they
issue
boiler
plate
denials...
in
fact,
in
1995
they
admitted
that
they
no
longer
were
going
to
even
address
the
issues
that
claimants
raised
in
their
decisions.
so
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
requiring
people
to
exhaust
a
step
is
to
look
at...
is
to
help
the
courts.
well,
how
does
it
help
the
courts
if
they
don't
even
tell
you
in
their
decisions
why
they
have
denied
the
case?
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
certainly
we
do
not...
chief
justice,
we
certainly
agree
that
the
agency
could
set
up
a
system
like
this
if
it
wanted
to.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
they
haven't
set
up
a
system
where
they
are
requiring
claimants
to
raise
specific
issues.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
the
regulations
provide
the
review
is
plenary.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes,
that
is
what
the
agency
is
doing,
and
this
is
not
an...
this
is
not
something
that's
provided
for
within
the
regulatory
scheme.
it
is
a
litigating
position
now
that
social
security
is
taking
in
court
matters
is,
they
are
raising
this
requirement,
or
this
objection
to
claimants
in
federal
court
to
seek
to
bar
them
from
raising
issues
when
the
vast
majority
of
claims
were
never
even
notified
of
the
need
to
raise
the
issues.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
justice
breyer,
that
provision
you're
referring
to
does
certainly
advise
you
of
the
need
to
exhaust,
and
there's
no
dispute
you
have
to
exhaust
that
step.
you
have
to
go
to
the
appeals
council
in
order
to
get...
go
into
federal
court,
but
it
doesn't
advise
you
and
give
you
warnings.
note
in
the
following
paragraph
it
says,
you
have
a
right
to
file
a
new
application
at
any
time,
but
filing
a
new
application
is
not
the
same
as
appealing.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
you
might
lose
benefits.
it
doesn't
warn
you
about
it
with
the
appeals
council.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
certainly
people
do
raise
issues,
as
i
said,
but
the
problem
is,
their
own
regulations
don't
mandate
that
you
specify
your
specific
issues,
and
when
you're
looking
at
imposing
on
a
claimant
this
exhaustion
requirement
you
have
to
look
at
the
prudential
considerations.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
mr.
chief
justice,
certainly
we
contend
this
is
a
matter
for
the
agency
and
not
for
the
court.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes,
i
think
the
agency
could
seek
to
do
that.
they
could
seek
to
promulgate
a
regulation
to
require
issue
exhaustion,
but,
of
course,
it
would
have
to
be
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent
i've
described
earlier.
it
would
have
to
be
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
social
security
act
to
be
protective
of
claimants
and
the
like.
it
would
have
to
subject
to
public
debate
about
whether
this
is
appropriate
step,
but
at
least
at
that
point
it
would
be
subject
to
all
the
discussions
that
need
to
occur
within
the
agency.
the
agency
has
conceded
that
this
should
not
apply
to
unrepresented
claimants,
for
example,
this
policy.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
well,
that's
an
unclear
question.
the
commissioner
has
not
stated
what
does
it
mean
to
be
a
representative.
anyone
can
represent
a
claimant
in
a
social
security
case.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes.
there's
some
information
in
our
brief
on
page
40,
footnote
28
we
point
out
that
43.6
percent...
and
1998
is
the
last
year
we
have
statistics.
43.6
percent
of
claimants
do
not
have
attorneys,
so
50,
about
56.4
have
attorney
representation.
now,
when
you
get
down
to...
the
social
security
statistics
are
unclear.
they
just
say,
representation
or
attorney,
or...
they
don't
say
what
a
representative
is.
you
can
have
your
mother
represent
you.
you...
a
parent
can
represent
a
child.
a
neighbor
can
represent
you.
so
it's
rather...
and
they
do
not
keep
statistics
regarding
a
representative
being
someone
in
the
business
of
providing
social
security
claimant
representation,
or
someone
who
is
just
representing
someone
as
a
favor.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
justice--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--justice
ginsburg,
all
the
commission
has
stated
in
their
documents
is
that
they
believe
this
rule
should
only
apply
to
represented
claimants.
they
do
not
draw
the
line
for
us,
and
that's
certainly
a
question
you
could
ask
the
government,
what
does
that
mean?
they
only
state
that
they
agree
that
unrepresented
people,
being
pro
se
claimants,
should
not
have
this
rule
enforced.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
well,
we
have
lodged
here--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--that's
correct.
there's
nothing
currently
that
says
that
the
claim--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--and
i
think
it's
significant
on
that
point,
justice
stevens,
that
in
the
social
security
context
the
alj
actually
wears
three
hats.
this
is
not
a
typical
adversarial
administrative
hearing.
in
a
social
security
hearing,
the
alj
wears
the
hat
of
identifying
the
issues.
that's
the
judge
of
the
alj.
the
alj
decides
what
the
issues
are.
the
alj
is
charged
with
a
duty
to
develop
the
record.
where...
what
other
agencies
require
the
decisionmaker
to
develop
the
file,
to
recontact
a
treating
provider
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
to
order
examinations
if
the
record
is
slight?
it
also
requires
the
alj
to
make
a
decision.
it's
an
inquisitorial
type
of
process.
it's
not
a
true
adversarial
system,
so
the
alj
in
this
system
identifies
the
issues.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes,
and
many
times
i
will
tell
you
there
are
many
instances
where
claimants
do
not
raise
specific
claims
of
error
and
the
appeals
council
sends
the
cases
back,
because
they
review
it,
and
they
make
a
decision
without
identifying
of
issues.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes.
at
the
alj
level
there's
a
tape
recording
of
the
hearing,
justice
stevens.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
there's
nothing
before
the
appeals
council.
they
say
they
have
oral
arguments.
i
think
they
had
six
in
the
last
10
years.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
so
there's
nothing...
there's
no,
really,
oral
argument.
these
matters
are
basically
handled
by
nonattorneys,
individuals--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--yes,
and
they...
they'll
take
an
applied
request
for
review.
they'll
take
the
form,
but
if
you're
an
attorney
you
don't
have
to
even
use
their
form.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
what
you
get
is
typically
what
we
have
here
in
our
record.
this
is
an
actual
boiler
plate
decision.
i
do
hundreds
of
these
cases.
i
read
records
all
the
time.
we
have
the
decision
on
page
71
of--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--of
the
joint
appendix,
and
what
you
have
is,
this
is
a
totally...
example
of
a
boiler
plate
denial.
it's
exactly
as
i
see
in
hundreds
of
these
files.
this
is
all
you
ever
get.
you
have
a
recitation
of
the
regulation,
404-970,
of
the
basis
they
can
review,
and
you
have
this
sentence:
the
appeals
council
has
concluded
that
there
is
no
basis
under
the
above
regulations
for
granting
your
request
for
review.
accordingly,
your
request
is
denied,
and
the
alj's
decision
stands
as
the
decision.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
no,
if
they
grant
review,
which
is
a
very
small
percentage
of
cases,
then
the
system
is
different.
then
they
do
actually
issue
decisions,
and
then
the
decision
looks
more
like
an
alj
decision.
it
reads
like
an
alj
decision,
and
that
becomes
a
decision
that's
appealed
in
the
federal
court.
when
they--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--this
is
not
a
decision,
it's
an
action.
it's
not
even
a
decision.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
yes.
it's
an
action,
they
deny
it,
and
then
you
go
into
federal
court
on
the--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--there
is
a...
the
social
security
regulations
have
a
reopening
provision,
and
any
claimant
can
seek
reopening
at
the
last
level
they
have
been
at.
if
the
last
level
was
the
appeals
council,
they
can
ask
the
appeals
council
to
reopen
the
case,
based
on
new
evidence,
for
example.
that
does
happen.
claimants
have
new
evidence,
they
can
ask
the
appeals
council
to
consider
the
new
evidence,
and
they
can
ask
the
appeals
council
to
extend
the
time
to
file--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--i
believe
it's
4
years
for...
to
ask
for
reopening
if
you're
a
social
security
claim--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--that
doesn't
really
happen.
i
mean,
typically
what
happens
is
that
the
appeals
council
is
so
backlogged,
quite
honestly,
what
happens
is,
an
attorney
writes
a
brief
to
the
appeals
council,
they
get
this
form
letter
back,
and
there's
no
reference
of
their
brief,
so
they
write
to
the
appeals
council
and
they
say,
consider
my
brief,
and
they'll
reopen
it
to
consider
the
arguments
that
were
up
there
but
they
never
found,
and
then
they'll
write
a
decision
with
those
arguments
addressed.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
the
problem
is
that...
i
believe
what
you're
asking,
then,
if
you've
been
denied
review
and
they
haven't
given
any
reasons,
you
want
them
to
go
back
and
readdress
the
reasons?
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
well,
your
honor,
reopenings
actually
are
quite
difficult
to
get.
i
mean,
they
don't
happen
that
often,
and
the
only
reason
i've
ever
seen
the
appeals
council
reopen
is
to
consider
something
that
was
submitted
and
was
overlooked
when
they
denied
the
review,
and
they'll
go
back
and
reopen
it
to
pull
that...
basically
to
include
that
they
have
now
looked
at
this
argument,
or
this
new
evidence
that
the
claimant
submitted
to
the
appeals
council.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
they
will...
if
you've
submitted
something
to
the
appeals
council
it
needs
to
be
a
part
of
the
record,
because
if
you're
going
into
federal
court--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--the
record
is
created
from
the
documents
that
were
the
alj
hearing,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing,
which
is--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--justice
kennedy,
i
guess
what
i...
i'm
a
little
confused
about
your
question.
there...
i'm
talking
about
a
case
where
someone
has
appealed
timely,
and
the
information
somehow
didn't
get
to
the
file.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
no,
that's
not
exactly
what
i
meant
to
say.
there
are
specific
requirements
in
the
regulations
in
general
for
reopening.
they
can
be
reopening
for
new...
new
evidence
is
the
most
common
reason
people
seek
reopening.
if
there's
new
evidence
in
their
file,
or
there's
been
a
mistake,
it's
obvious
on
the
record,
like
someone's
earnings
records
were
not
accurate,
and
they
were
denied
benefits
because
they
weren't
sure,
they
can
seek
reopening
to
prove
there
was
an
error,
those
kinds
of
reasons.
but
this
is
not...
to
the
appeals
council,
the
point
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
complete
record
to
go
into
federal
court,
and
in
my
experience,
when
things
are
overlooked,
it
just...
all
it
does
is,
they
then
issued
the
same
letter
i've
just
stated,
stating
we
considered
your
brief
dated
such
and
such,
and
then
that
is
what
occurs.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
social
security
proceedings
are
different
from
other
administrative
agencies,
and
the
other
agencies
that
have
been
described
by
the
government,
they
actually
have
statutes
and
regulations
that
require
issue
exhaustion,
and
here
we
have
a
system
where
not
only
do
the
rules
and
regulations
not
require,
but
we
submit
that
the
agency
actually
misleads
claimants
and
discourages
them
from
specifying
the
very
issues
they
wish
to
raise,
and
that's
a
very
important
point.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
the...
in
fact--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--most
agencies
have
regulations.
the
icc,
the
epa,
the
master...
the
merit
systems
protection
board--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--i
think,
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
the
prudential
consideration.
this
is
what
we're
looking
at.
when
the
agency
does
not
have
a
requirement,
or
perhaps
has
a
requirement
that
doesn't
require
issue
exhaustion,
as
you've
just
described,
justice
scalia--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--you
have
to
look
at
the
prudential
considerations.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
it
doesn't
make
sense
to--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--propose
an
issue
exhaustion.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
but
in
this
case--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--but
according
to
the
mccarthy
v.
madigan
case,
you
have
to
look
at
this
matter
not
just
as
a
global
rule,
but
what
makes
sense
given
the
congressional
intent,
and
given
the
agency's
own
rules
and
regulations
and
policies,
and
in
this
particular
case,
when
you
look
at
that,
and
you
look
at
those
considerations,
their...
the
act,
and
the
emphasis
on
an
informality
and
nonadversarial
system,
the
fact
that
the
review
is
plenary
by
regulation
before
the
appeals
council,
none
of
the
prudential
considerations
for
the
application
of
issue
exhaustion
apply
in
this
case.
it's
simply
not
consistent.
it's
not
going
to
promote
the
agency
autonomy
when
the
agency
provides
itself
that
all
issues
are
reviewed,
and
that
the
system
is
intended
to
be
claimant
friendly.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
$10
limit
you're
referring
to
was
in
va
cases,
not
in
social
security
cases.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
what
we're
looking
at
here
is,
the
government
is
coming
into
court
and
they're
taking
a
litigating
position,
asking
this
court
to
adopt
a
position
that's
simply
not
supported
by
their
own
agency,
policies,
procedures,
and
forms.
i
think
it's
important
that
the
form
says
it
takes
10
minutes
to
complete.
i
write
these
briefs
for
a
living.
you
cannot
write
an
appeals
council
brief
in
10
minutes.
8
to
10
hours
minimum.
you
need
a
record
of
the
case,
you
have
to
ask
the
appeals
council
to
send
you
the
tape,
the
transcribing--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--the
other
thing
is,
we're
talking
about
a
national
program.
there's
a
need
for
uniformity
in
a
national
program.
the
government's
coming
in
here
and
they're
saying,
well,
it
shouldn't
apply
to
people
who
have...
who
aren't
represented,
so
you're
going
to
have
a
system
where
some
people
have
one
rule,
other
people
have
another
rule.
they're
coming
into
court,
they're
admitting
that
some
issues
are
futile.
they
acknowledge
that
in
their
brief.
so
you're
going
to...
so
applying
this
rule
is
going
to
result
in
a
huge
amount
of
procedural
litigation.
was
an
issue
raised
or
not?
was
someone
represented
or
not?
was
it
futile
to
raise
it?
why
do
we
want
to
clog
the
federal
courts
with
procedural
matters?
why
can't
we
get
to
the
issues
and
reach
the
issues
if
they're
meritorious?
we're
talking
about
disabled
claimants
who
have
been
denied
benefits,
who
are
seeking
to
get
benefits
in
federal
court.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
i
accept
that,
but
if
the
point
is
that
the
agency
itself
doesn't
even
provide
reasons,
how
is
it
helping
the
court--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--and
if
the
agency
chooses
to
have
that
policy,
then
they
should
subject
that
kind
of
a
policy
to
notice
and
comment.
just
changing
a
form
is
not
subject
to
public
debate.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
but
in
contrast,
for
example,
the
va
form
is
very
detailed.
it's
a
page
and
a
half
to
write
your
issues.
there's
a
statement
that
you
have
to...
you
do
this
by
identifying
the
issues
you
are
appealing.
it's
very
specific,
instructing
claimants.
here,
it's
a
very
misleading
system.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
no,
there's
no--
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
--there's
nothing
in
the
form
itself
or
in
the
notice
of
the
decision
to
the
claimant
warning
the
claimant
of
the...
what
would
happen
if
the
claimant
fails
to
raise
all
issues.
ms.
sarah
h.
bohr
thank
you.
