justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
forms
contain
spaces
in
which
you're
supposed
to
state
the
reason
for
your
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
claimant
was
represented
by
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
every
stage,
no?
now,
the
point
you're
making
now,
that
there's
no
warning,
i
suppose
would
have
some
force
in
a
case
where
you're
dealing
with
a
layman.
but
where
you're
dealing
with
a
lawyer
who
knows
the
usual
rule
in
administrative
cases
that
you
have...
indeed,
any
case,
judicial
or
administrative,
that
you
have
to
have
complained
about
what
you're
appealing,
and
if
you
don't
specify
what
it
is,
you
abandon
it.
isn't
that
the
usual
rule
throughout
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
can
change
that.
they
can
change
that.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
know
they
haven't,
but
what
you're
driving
us
to
is
to
say
that
although
ssa
has
been
very...
very
liberal
in
saying,
you
don't
have
to
mention
whatever
your
claim
is,
we'll
look
at
it,
and
if
there's
anything
that's
wrong
we'll
correct
it.
they
may
well
be
willing
to
do
that
internally,
but
if
we
now
tell
them
that
if
you
adopt
this
approach,
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
come
to
the
courts
and
reverse
you
for
something
that
you
didn't
see,
and
that
the
claimant
before
you
didn't
bring
to
your
attention,
they're
going
to
say,
now,
wait
a
minute.
maybe
we
ought
to
require
people
to
set
forth
the
reasons
that
they're
complaining.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
to
punish
the
social
security
administration
by
rendering
their
decisions
more
reviewable
than
the
decisions
of
other
agencies
simply
because
they've
decided
to
be
more
generous
to
the
claimants.
i
don't
see
that
it
follows.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
they
don't
have
to
raise
issues.
they
don't
have
to
raise
issues.
the
appeals
council
is
willing
to
consider
issues
that
are
not
raised.
but
that's
quite
a
separate
question
from
whether,
if
you
don't
raise
it
and
the
appeals
council
doesn't
see
it,
you
can
then
haul
the
appeals
council
into
court.
that's
a
separate
question,
and
i
don't
see
why
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
because
they're
generous,
they
should
be
more
readily
suable
in
district
court
than
other
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'm
not
sure
they
have
to
make
that
exception
for
anybody,
lawyers
representing
or
mothers
representing.
i
mean,
you
do
not
have
any
basis
for
objecting
to
a
decision
that
you've
gotten
and
asking...
you
know,
saying
it's
wrong,
and
therefore
reverse
it,
unless
you
have
some
reason
why
it
was
wrong
in
mind.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer...
a
rocket
scientist
or
even
a
lawyer
to
know
that
when
you're
complaining
about
a
decision
you
must
have
some
reason
for
complaining
about
it.
why
can't
any
layman
grasp
that
simple
fact,
and
then
there's
a
line
on
the
back,
you
know,
the
decision
below
was
wrong
because,
you
know,
three
lines.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
i
mean,
my
goodness,
is
this
really
something
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it's
up
to
the
agency
what
rules
of
exhaustion
the
courts
apply?
i
mean,
you
know...
or
is
it
up
to
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
an
agency--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know,
but
suppose...
the
icc's
gone,
happily,
but
let's
pick
one
of
the
other
agencies.
suppose
some
other
agency
adopts
a
rule
and
says,
we
think
that
courts
really
need
not
require
that
issues
be
presented
to
us
before
courts
decide
them,
and
hence
we
advise
everybody
who
practices
before
us
that
you
need
not
raise
issues
before
us
first.
you
can
go
to
district
court,
or
to
the
court
of
appeals,
regardless
of
whether
the
issue
was
raised
before
us.
do
you
think
the
courts
would
be
bound
by
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
does
it
tell
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think...
i
look
at
the
prudential
considerations,
and
what
i
say
is,
it's
none
of
the
agency's
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
whether...
you
know,
what
we
require
in
order
to
bring
a
case
before
the
courts
is
up
to
the
courts,
not
up
to
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
counsel
for
the
other
side
says
the
agency
doesn't
want
its
best
shot.
the
agency
itself
doesn't
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
it
is
entitled,
that
section,
procedures
before
appeals
council
on
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
obviously
referring
to
what
happens
after
review
has
been
granted
and
review
is
being
conducted.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
percentage
of
cases
do
they
in
fact
review?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
that
in
this
experiment
that
they're
doing
they
take
into
account
not
only
whether
more
district
court
cases
are
filed
without
the
appeal,
but
also
whether
uniformity
is
produced
by
having
all
of
these
appeals
go...
not
get
dumped
right
into
federal
court.
i
always
thought
the
whole
advantage
of
an
administrative
agency
was
to
assure
uniformity
of
decisionmaking,
which--
