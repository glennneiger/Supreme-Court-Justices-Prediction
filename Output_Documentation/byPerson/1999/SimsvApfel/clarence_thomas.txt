justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
sims
brought
a
claim
for
social
security
benefits
based
on
certain
alleged
disabilities.
an
administrative
law
judge
denied
her
claim.
she
requested
review
by
the
social
security
appeals
council,
which
declined
to
review
her
claim.
sims
then
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
in
mississippi,
arguing
that
the
administrative
law
ludge
had
erred
in
three
ways.
the
district
court
ruled
against
sims
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court.
in
so
doing,
the
fifth
circuit
refused
to
consider
two
of
the
three
issues
sims
had
raised
before
the
district
court,
because
she
had
not
mentioned
them
in
her
request
for
review
that
she
submitted
to
the
appeals
council.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
petitioner
waived
the
issues
that
she
did
not
exhaust
by
not
including
them
in
her
request
for
review.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
no
statute
or
social
security
regulation
requires
issue
exhaustion
and
the
request
for
review
by
the
council.
the
social
security
commissioner
therefore
urges
us
to
impose
such
a
requirement
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy.
when
we
have
done
this
previously,
it
was
because
the
administrative
proceeding
at
issue
was
adversarial,
and
thus
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
parties
rather
than
the
agency
to
develop
the
issues
before
the
agency.
this
reason
does
not
apply
to
the
appeals
council,
which
is
inquisitorial
rather
than
adversarial.
the
applicable
regulations
make
clear
that
the
council
does
not
depend
on
the
claimant
to
develop
the
issues
for
review.
as
a
result,
it
makes
little
sense
to
require
issue
exhaustion
in
this
context.
justice
oâ€™connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
