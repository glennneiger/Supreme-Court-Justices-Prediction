justice

and
if
it
went
just
to
the
alj
and
then
directly
to
court,
as
congress...
that
has
been
proposed,
to
cut
out
this
appeals
council
altogether.
if
it
went
from
the
alj
to
the
court,
then
you
would
agree
that
you
would
have
to
raise
in
the
district
court
any
issue
in
order
to
get
it
on
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
spend
about...
the
appeals
council
is
the
fourth
rung
or
the
third
rung
within
the
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
representation
mean
in
drawing
that
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
how
it
works
out
in
practice
before
the
social
security
administration,
before
the
appeals
council?
what
percentage
of
the
people
are
represented
by
counsel,
what
percentage
by
lay
representatives,
what
percentage
pro
se?
do
we
have
any
information
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
we
know
what
position
the
agency
is
taking
with
respect
to
who
is
a
representative
that
will
be
held
to
this
rule?
is
it
only
counsel?
in
other
words,
is
the
agency
saying,
well,
for
people
who
are
represented
by
a
parent,
a
best
friend,
we
don't
apply
this
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
when
they
are
represented
by
counsel,
counsel
meaning--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
stewart,
the
agency
itself
has
determined
that
the
appeals
council
is
not
going
to
be
used
in
a
certain
number
of
cases,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
long
has
that
been
going
on,
and
how
large
is
this
experiment
of
displacing
the
appeals
council?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
tell
district
courts,
mr.
stewart,
but
lots
of
agencies
have
appeal
instructions.
at
every
stage,
they
say,
if
you
want
to
appeal,
this
is
what
you
must
do,
and
spell
out
the
details,
not
directed
at
all
to
what
the
district
court
is
going
to
find
later,
but
just
the
audience
for
these
instructions
of
the
people
who
are
governed
by
the
system,
and
surely
there
are
agencies...
i
would
imagine
the
department
of
justice
encourages
agencies
to
do
that,
to
clarify
for
the
people
the
steps
they
must
take
in
order
to
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before...
during
the
review,
at
least
the
eighth
circuit
reported,
and
was
this
inaccurate,
the
appeals
council
routinely
considers
arguments
not
specifically
raised
by
the
claimants
before
it,
a
product
of
its
duty
to
review
an
alj's
decision
in
an
informal,
nonadversary
manner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it
does,
isn't
it
somewhat
deceptive
for
the...
if
this
is
routine,
as
the
eighth
circuit
thought
it
was,
and
then
claimant
comes
along,
or
her
coworkers
have
told
her,
well,
that's
how
they
handle
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
the
agency
says
no,
not
for
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
had...
this
business
about
distinguishing
between
represented
and
unrepresented
people,
that's
a
matter
of
grace
within
the
agency
now?
they
have
no
legislation
and
no
regulation
that
spells
that
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
also,
from
the
experience
in
the
courts,
that
is,
in
a
number
of
these
cases
there
are
hassles
in
the
district
court
about
whether
you
in
fact
raised
the
issue,
because
you've
got
only
these
three
lines
on
the
form.
in
fact,
in
this
very
case,
wasn't
one
of
the
issues
the
fifth
circuit
said
hadn't
been
raised
debated
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
it
was
raised
or
not
raised?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
in
fact
didn't
it
happen
in...
well,
both
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
case
said
in
the
end
the
claimant
lost
on
the
merits,
and
the
court
thought
it
was
not
worthwhile
hassling
over
whether
it
was
waived
or
not,
since
it
had
no
merit
in
any
event.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
may
get
rid
of
the
appeals
council
altogether,
because
there
must
be
some...
well,
you
set
up
the
experiment
and
10
states
don't
have
it.
is
there
also
any
consideration
in
the
agency
about
revising
the
form
so
that
people
will
know
what
they're
expected
to
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
committed
to
whom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
mean,
this
agency
says...
this
court
says,
agency,
just
do
what
you're
doing.
why
would
the
agency
be
motivated
to
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
there's
no
reason
to
wait
on
the
court
to
make
that
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
stewart
on
the
question
of
uniformity,
it's
been
said
that
the
appeals
council
does
not
follow
case
law,
that
it's...
that
each
case
is
set
up
on
its
own,
and
they
don't
follow
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
add
anything
of
the
nature
of...
mr.
stewart
says...
it
isn't...
as
i
understand
it,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
you,
that
you'll
be
precluded
in
court,
does
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
va
form?
