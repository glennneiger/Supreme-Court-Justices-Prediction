justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
a
person
is
charged
with
a
crime
of
violence
or
drug-trafficking
and
with
using
or
carrying
a
firearm,
that
that
is
an
indictable
offense,
and
sets
out
elements
of
a
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
i
would
think
your
position
might
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
that
doesn't
even
set
out
the
elements
of
a
complete
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
do
agree
that
that
states
out
the
elements
of
an
offense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
you're
correct,
i
guess
it
would
require
setting
aside
the
conviction
and
sentence,
and
sending
it
back,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
robinson,
what
has
the
practice
been
in
the
various
circuits
under
this
statute?
have
they
been,
as
petitioner's
counsel
tell
us,
in
most
circuits
treating
the
type
of
weapon
as
something
alleged
specifically
in
the
indictment
and
proven
at
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
data
showing
how
many
sentences
will
be
affected
by
a
conclusion
by
this
court
that
the
petitioner
is
correct
in
his
reading?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
it's
vastly
different
in
terms
of
results
if
the
firearm
is
a
machinegun,
and
according
to
petitioner's
counsel
the
evidence
isn't
all
that
clear
linking
this
particular
individual
with
a
machinegun,
and
we
don't
know
if
the
jury
would
have
been
able
to
make
that
determination,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel
for
petitioner
says
yes,
that's
a
completed
offense.
it's
the
5-year
offense.
