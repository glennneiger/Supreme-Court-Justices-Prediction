well,
if
the
elements
of
the
crime
were
not
adequately
set
forth
in
the
indictment,
why
wouldn't
the
government
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial?
the
conviction
is
set
aside,
and
there's
a
second
trial.
that's
not
double
jeopardy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
that
if
they
don't,
in
a
murder
case,
indict
for
deliberation
and
premeditation
and
he's
found
guilty
of
first
degree
they
can't
retry
him
for
first
degree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
find
him
guilty.
they
find
him
guilty
of
murder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
been
an
element
omitted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
or...
and
there
was
no
instruction
on
it,
let's
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see
your
point
is,
is
that
they
found
him
guilty
only
of
the
lesser
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you're
right,
wouldn't
the
jury
specifically
have
to
be
instructed
that
this
is
an
element,
or
does
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
merely...
it's...
merely
the
fact
that
it's
in
the
indictment
would
not
suffice,
unless
the
jury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--were
instructed
that
it
had
to
find
everything
alleged
in
the
indictment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
some
general
instruction
that
the
jury
cannot
convict
unless
it
finds
all
of
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
indictment
to
be
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
would
have
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you...
if
you
prevail,
and
this
becomes
precedent
in
other
cases,
the
jury
would
have
to
have
been
specifically
instructed
in
each
case
that
this
is
an
element
that
they
must
find.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
mere
fact
that
it's
in
the
indictment
would
be
insufficient.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
jury
had
to
find...
under
the
indictment,
the
jury
had
to
find
that
they
had
a
firearm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
and
i'm
still
puzzled
as
to
why
that,
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
isn't
just
an
insufficient
indictment
that
requires
a
new
trial,
because
it
didn't
say
anything
about
what
kind
of
firearm.
you
just
assume
that
any
time
an
element
of
an
indictment
is
insufficient,
the
jury
convicts
of
the
lowest
offense.
i'm
just
not...
i
don't
understand
that.
