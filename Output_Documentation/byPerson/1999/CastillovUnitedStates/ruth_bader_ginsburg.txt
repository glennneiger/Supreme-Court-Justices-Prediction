mr.
halbrook,
are
you
making
both
a
statutory
argument
and
a
constitutional
argument
with
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
have
an
alternative
argument
that
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
as
the
government
urges,
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
know
there
is
a
case
pending
before
this
court,
apprendi--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
does
make
the
argument
that
anything
that
enhances
a
sentence
beyond
the
maximum,
that
that
must
be
given
to
the
jury.
that
argument
would
be
equally
available
in
your
case,
but
you
say
you're
not
making
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
data
that
tells
us
how
many
defendants
currently
serving
in
prison
as
a
result
of
an
offense
under
this
section
would
be
affected
by
going
along
with
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
evidence
submitted
about
the
kind
of
firearms
in
the
jury
trial?
they
must
have
submitted
some
elements
of
whether
machineguns
were
used.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robinson,
may
i
ask
you,
what
was
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
on
this,
or
was
it
up
to
each
u.s.
attorney
to
decide
whether
they
were
going
to
treat
this
as
something
that
should
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
put
to
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
there
a
variety
of
approaches
among
u.s.
attorneys?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
robinson,
you
recognized
in
your
brief
that
if
apprendi
is
interpreted...
if
the
court
there
should
hold
that
the...
increasing
the
maximum
is
a
matter
that
can't
be
determined
by
the
judge
but
must
be
determined
by
the
jury
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
you
recognize
that
that
would
impact
on
this
case
even
though
mr.
halbrook
clarified
three
times
that
he
didn't
make
that
constitutional
argument,
but
i
was
confused
by
what
you
said
should
happen.
you
said
something
about,
in
the
event
that
apprendi
should
determine
that
an
increase
in
the
maximum
must
go...
must
be
a
question
to
the
jury,
then
what
follows
in
this
case?
