mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
amendment
to
section
924(c)
in
1986,
which
added
various
firearm
types
to
the
section,
it
was
the
common
practice
in
the
federal
courts
to
allege
in
the
indictment
and
to
submit
to
the
jury
for
determination
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
firearm
type.
this
reflected
a
long
tradition
in
both
federal
and
state
law
under
which
firearm
type
was
an
element
of
the
offense,
of
the
various
offenses.
firearm
type
is
frequently
contested
at
trial,
and
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
juries
normally
resolve.
based
on
its
reading
of
legislative
history,
the
lower
court
in
this
case
found
for
the
first
time
that,
in
essence,
the
jury
is
a
lower
level
gatekeeper
in
the
sense
that
it
finds
facts
justifying
a
5-year
period
of
incarceration,
but
opening
the
door
to
factual
findings
by
the
sentencing
court
according
to
the
preponderance-of-evidence
standard
that
justify
a
30-year
sentence,
as
in
this
case,
or,
in
the
case
of
a
second
conviction,
life
imprisonment.
the
section
in
question,
the
first
part
of
the
section,
sets
forth
elements
for
the
lower
level
offense
in
some
83
words.
if
you
looked
at
from
whoever
to
5
years
you'll
find
the
various
elements,
you'll
find
the
federal
jurisdictional
nexus,
and
we
submit
that
congress,
in
a
very
concise
manner,
instead
of
repeating
all
of
that
wording,
simply
set
forth
the
concise
way
of
speaking
that
if
the
firearm
is,
and
then
to
give
a
list
of
firearm
types,
then
the
punishment
is
of
another--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--the
elements
of
the
offense
is
that
a
person
carried
or
used
a
firearm
therein
and
in
relation
to
a
federal
crime
of
violence...
in
this
case
there's
also
drug-trafficking,
and
other
cases.
it
has
to
be
something
that
is
prosecutable
in
a
federal
court,
and--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--a
crime
of
violence,
yes,
your
honor.
so
those
are
basically
the
elements,
and
when
congress
amended
the
law
in
1986
to
include
other
firearm
types,
it
simply
sets
forth
the
wording
that
if
the
firearm
is,
and
in
this
case
in
'86
the
amendment
was
a
machinegun
or
a
firearm
that's
equipped
with
a
firearm
silencer
or
firearm
muffler,
and
those
were
treated
as
elements
of
the
offense
up
until
basically
this
case.
that
was
the
practice
in
the
federal
courts.
there
were
at
least
three
circuits
that
adopted
the
rule
that
those
are
offense
elements.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
think
that,
and
i...
this
court
first
held--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--oh,
because
it
doesn't
start
by
saying
it
shall
be
unlawful.
the
way
this
was
adopted
originally
back
in
the
1968
gun
control
act
was,
it
was
a
floor
amendment
and
section
924(c)
had
penalties
but
also
elements
were
put
in.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
agree
with
that.
it
says,
whoever
shall
do
this,
and
it
doesn't
say
it's
unlawful,
but
then
when
you
get
to
the
penalty
clause
it's
obviously
by
inference.
i
think
this
court
indicated
in
the
jones
case
about
the
federal
carjacking
law
that
it
characterized
the
initial
part
of
the
statute
as
describing
some
pretty
obnoxious
behavior
without
saying
that
it's
unlawful,
but
then
you
get
to
the
penalty
clause
and
then
it's
obvious
that
that's
an
offense.
and
this
court
first
held
in
the
simpson
case
back
in
the
post
'68
period
that
924(c)
is
an
offense
and
it's
not
just
a
sentencing
factor
for
some
other
crime,
because--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
we're
not
arguing
the
statute's
unconstitutional.
we're
arguing
that
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
such
that
the
different
firearm
types
are
offense
elements.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
we
don't
make
that
argument,
and
the
reason
we
don't
make
that
argument...
we
do
appeal
to
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt,
but
when
the
decision
was
first
made
that
these
are
sentencing
factors,
it
was
the
universal
practice
in
the
federal
courts
that
they
were
elements,
and
then
we
had
several
circuit
opinions
saying
that
these
are
offense
elements,
and
we
didn't
think,
and
don't
think
to
this
day
that
it
would
be
a
service
to
this
court
in
a
loose
way
to
say
that
something's
unconstitutional
when
it
can
so
easily
be
interpreted
in
the
narrow
way
to
avoid
the
unconstitutional
result
or
according
to
the
rule
of
lenity--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
we
might
not
be
prepared
to
lose
the
case,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--we
haven't
made
that
argument.
it
was
not
in
our
statement
of
issues,
and
the
reason
we
didn't
make
it,
once
again,
is
that
so
many
times
it
seems
that,
like
defense
lawyers
very
quickly
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
say
some
law's
unconstitutional
when
there's
no
need
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
we're
making
it
in
the
sense
of
the
rule
of
constitutional
doubt.
i
mean,
in
the
apprendi
case
the
statute
explicitly
declares
that
it's
not
an
element,
that
the
judge
makes
the
determination
at
sentencing,
and
it's
based
on
the
preponderance-of-evidence
standard,
and
this
statute
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--oh,
no...
no,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
we
appealed
to
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt
in
the
sense
of
the
statutory
interpretation.
there
may
be--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
because
the
jury
finds
facts
that
result
in
a
5-year
period,
and
the
maximum
is
increased
sixfold,
up
to
30
years,
or
even
to
life
imprisonment,
and
it's
not
determined
by
the
jury,
and
it's
not
in
the
indictment.
footnote
6
in
the
jones
case
is
why
we
think
that
the
rule
of
constitutional
doubt
applies
here.
any
fact
other
than
recidivism
that
is
to
be
determined
by
the
jury
and
put
in
the
indictment
is
in
accord
with
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
guarantees
in
that
respect.
so
it's
our
position
that
when
you
look
at
the
statute
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
reasonable
minds
could
conclude
only
that
it
would
be
interpreted
in
the
more
stringent
way,
because
that
was
not
the
way
it
was
ever
interpreted
up
until
this
case,
and
the
general
rule
is
that
when
there's
two
interpretations,
and
when
the
one
interpretation
raises
the
constitutional
doubt,
and
is
also
the
more
stringent
interpretation,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
also
applies.
so
when
congress
enacted
this,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
record,
although
we
think
that
legislative
history
is
a...
not
something
that
overcomes
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt
or
the
rule
of
lenity,
but
when
you
actually
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
does
not
state
that
these
are
sentencing
factors
and
not
offense
elements.
you
simply
have
references
to
the
fact
that
these
are
mandatory
sentences.
the
provision
as
adopted
in
1968
had
mandatory...
a
mandatory
sentence
for
carrying
and
use
of
a
firearm,
and
with
the
1986
amendment
you
have
a
mandatory
sentence
for
machineguns
and
firearms
equipped
with
silencers,
and
then
over
the
years
you
have
other
amendments
which
put
in
short-barrel
shotguns
and
rifles,
and
destructive
devices,
and
there
simply
was
no
legislative
history...
you'll
see
two
paragraphs
of
legislative
history
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
and
it
in
no
way
makes
clear
that
these
are
offense
elements.
the
statute
is
written
in
a
way
such
that
there
are
83
words
in
the
first
clause
which
gives
the
offense
elements,
and
in
a
very
concise
way
it
doesn't
repeat
all
of
the
federal
jurisdictional
nexus.
it
does
not...
it's
not
redundant
in
other
words,
and
it
was
set
forth
in
a
way
that
there
was
never
any
question
in
the...
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
way
that
this
law
was
administered
in
the
federal
courts
up
until
this
case
was
decided
that
indicated
in
any
way
that
the
firearm
types
are
not
offense
elements.
we
think
that
by
making
the
jury
in
essence
a
lower
level
gatekeeper
which
finds
facts
resulting
in
a
5-year
period
of
incarceration,
and
then
giving
it
to
the
sentencing
judge
to
find
by
a
mere
preponderance,
that
those
do
implicate
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
the
indictment
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
the
due
process
clause
and
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
of
the
accusation
in
the
sixth
amendment,
and
by
interpreting
the
law
to
mean
that
these
are
offense
elements,
there
is
no
constitutional
doubt.
that
resolves
the
constitutional
doubt
against
an
interpretation
that
raises
that
issue.
if
you
want
to
go
back
in
history,
this
long
tradition
of
both
federal
and
state
law
under
which
these
are
offense
elements,
as
far
as
federal
law
goes
we
go
back
to
the
national
firearms
act
of
1934,
and
for
the
first
time
congress
made
it
unlawful
to
possess
or
to
receive
unregistered
machineguns
and
the
short-barreled
shotguns
and
some
other
types
of
firearms,
and
it
was
an
offense
element
then.
in
the
1968
act,
there
are
various
offenses
under
title
i
of
the
act
related
to
machineguns,
short-barreled
shotguns
and
other...
and
destructive
devices,
and
those
are
invariably
elements
of
the
offense,
and
so
if
we
were
to
take
respondent's
position
we
would
assume
that
congress
simply
did
not
make
these
elements
without
any
indication
that
these
were
nonelements
and
without
any
structural
provision.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
written
in
a
way
that
these
are
not
elements.
in
the
carjacking
case
resolved
by
this
court
in
jones,
you'll
see
the
same
identical
structure
in
this
statute
as
exists
with
section
924(c),
namely
that
whoever
engages
in
certain
action,
in
that
case
takes
a
car
by
use
of
a
firearm,
using
intimidation
or
force
or
violence,
shall
be
sentenced
to
a
certain
amount
and,
in
the
case
of
this
statute,
whoever
uses
or
carries
a
firearm
in
a
crime
of
violence
prosecutable
in
a
federal
court
will
receive
a
certain
sentence.
and
in
jones,
as
in
this
case,
it
says,
and
if,
the
and-if
clause
exists.
in
other
words,
with
jones,
and
if
there's
bodily
injury
then
the
sentence
is
of
a
different
type,
and
in
this
case,
and
if
the
firearm
is
a
machinegun
or
destructive
device,
then
there's
another
sentence.
so--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--not
the
conviction,
your
honor.
only
the
sentence.
the
mandatory
penalty
in
this
case
is
5
years
imprisonment,
and
so
we're
asking
that
the
court
reverse
only
the
portion
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
that
relates
to
the
sentence.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
there's
no
statistics,
but
i
think
the
number
is
not
very
high
yet,
and
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
because
the
statute
was
uniformly
administered
from
1986
when
it
was
amended
with
these
other
provisions,
up
until
the
branch
decision
in
this
case,
and
during
that
time
it
was
invariable
that
the
type
of
firearm
was
alleged
in
the
indictment,
so
none
of
those
cases
would
reopen.
it
would
not
be
like
the
bailey
situation,
where
the
term
use
was
subjected
to
an
overbroad
interpretation
by
many
of
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
it
would,
your
honor,
yes,
so
we
don't
see
that
the
government
would
have
any
opportunity
to
do
that,
but...
that
would
be
double
jeopardy.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
to...
well,
these
petitioners
were
indicted
for
and
convicted
of
use
of
a
firearm,
a
5-year
offense,
and
since
the
machinegun,
or
whatever
the
other
types,
were
not
in
the
indictment
or
found
by
the
jury,
they
could
not
be
tried
again
on
these
charges.
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
i
think
they've
had
their
bite
at
the
apple,
justice
kennedy.
in
other
words,
once
a
person
is
tried
for
a
certain
crime
arising
out
of
certain
facts,
and
the
jury
makes
a
determination,
and
the
government's
not
satisfied
with
that,
they're
not
entitled
to
go
back
and
re-indict
the
crime
again.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
couldn't...
let's
say
you
convicted
someone
of
manslaughter,
you
couldn't
go
back
and
charge
him
again
with
murder
and
allege--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--malice
aforethought.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--oh,
you
mean
if
the
element
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment?
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
in--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--yes,
your
honor,
and
yours...
your
hypothetical
is,
you've
got
the
higher
offense
being
alleged
in
the
indictment
without
a
certain
element
of
it.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
justice
souter,
it
would
be
as
if
manslaughter
was
charged,
and
the
person
was
tried
on
that
indictment,
the
jury
makes
that
determination--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--we
think
that
what
should
be
done
in
this
case
is,
it
should
be
remanded
for
resentencing,
as
was
done
in
the
jones
case.
we
think
this
is
an
identical
situation
where,
in
that
case
bodily
injury
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
honor,
the
statute
imposes
a
mandatory
sentence
of
5
years,
that's
correct.
it
says,
shall
be
sentenced
to
5
years.
it's
not
within
the
sentencing
guidelines.
justice
breyer,
sorry.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
honor,
there
are
two
other
courts
of
appeals
who
followed
the
branch
decision,
and
if
i
could
answer
that
maybe
and
respond
more
completely
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question,
because
it's
only
been
in
the
last
couple
of
years
or
so
that
the
first
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit
have
indicated
they
agreed
with
the
branch
decision.
the
first
circuit
prior
to
that
time
in
the
melvin
case
had
held
the
other
way,
and
so
in
that
circuit
the
law
would
have
been
administered
in
a
way
consistent
with
that
opinion,
so
we
don't
think
there's
that
many
who...
circuits
where
this
will
be
a
problem,
and
in
those
circuits
we
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
cases
to
reopen,
and
i
have
a
suspicion...
i
cannot
verify
it,
but
probably
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
these
other
circuits
where
now
that's
the
rule,
i
would
be
willing
to
guess
that
many
times
the
type
of
firearm
is
alleged
in
the
indictment.
traditionally,
an
indictment,
if
you
use
this
as
an
example,
would
say
something
like,
the
defendant
did
use
or
carry
a
firearm,
to
wit
a
machinegun,
and
you
would
have
a
description
of
the
model
number
and
the
serial
number
and
all
of
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct,
and
it--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
not
the
case
if
you
have
surplusage,
or
things
that
are
not
necessary
for
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--those
elements.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct,
and
you
would
have
to
have
the
specific
definition
of
the
specific
firearm
that
you're
talking
about,
because
when
you
start
looking
at
the
definitions
under
machinegun
or
destructive
device,
you'll
find
many
different
kinds
of
definitions,
and
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
allegation
that
the
firearm
type
is
of
the
type
described
in
whatever
the
specific
definition
is.
when
you
look
at
the
court
decisions
as
to
whether
elements
were
properly
charged
in
regard
to
machineguns,
destructive
devices
and
what-not,
and
also
cases
involving
sufficiency
of
evidence,
the
courts
look
at
each
and
every
one
of
the
definitional
elements,
so
that
if
a
short-barreled
rifle
is
charged,
part
of
the
definition
of
rifle
is
that
it
has
a
barrel
with
a
bore
that's
rifled,
and
if
there's
no
evidence
in
the
case
about
it
being
rifled,
that's
not
enough
to
sustain
a
conviction.
so
by
the
same
token,
here,
in
924(c)
a
properly
charged
indictment
would
allege
a
firearm,
to
wit,
for
example,
destructive
device
or
machinegun,
and
it
would
have
some
kind
of
definition
that
they're
hanging
their
hat
on
as
to
which
definition
of
destructive
device,
for
example,
is
being
alleged
in
the
indictment,
because
the
definitions
run
the
course
from
a
rifle
over
50
caliber
to
a
grenade
or
a
bomb,
or
i
mean,
many
diverse
kinds
of
things
are
called
destructive
devices,
so
a
properly
worded
indictment
would
have
this
information.
we
think
this
case
implicates
the
constitutional
values
that
go
back
to
the
winship
case,
for
example,
the
idea
that
each
and
every
element
of
the
offense
has
to
be
in
the
indictment,
and
it
has
to
be
proven
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
idea
of
what
can
the
legislature
make
a
crime
and
what
can
it
declare
a
sentencing
factor,
we
think
that
that
is
further
doctrine
that
supports
our
position
here
in
terms
of
interpreting
the
statute
to
avoid
constitutional
doubt,
that
the
court
has
been
grappling
with
that
in
other
decisions,
and
in
the
apprendi
case,
and
it's
our
position
that
to
avoid
these
issues,
that
the
statute
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
a
way
to
avoid
any
constitutional
doubt,
and
that
means
that
it
has
to
be
construed
narrowly.
the
case
of
mullaney
v.
wilbur,
which
had
to
do
with
the
shifting
of
burdens,
i
think
is
relevant
here
in
terms
of
avoiding
constitutional
doubt,
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
in
those
kinds
of
cases
where
the
burden
would
shift,
it
was
still
the
jury
that
determined
whether
the
defendant
proved
by
a
preponderance...
a
lack
of
malice,
for
example.
and
here
you
have
the...
it's
taken
completely
from
the
jury
and
given
to
the
sentencing
court
in
terms
of...
i
mean,
the
defendant
cannot
even
put
on
a
case
before
the
jury
that--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--it
was
at
sentencing,
your
honor.
it
was
right
before
sentencing.
the
government
filed
a
brief
arguing
that
the
judge
would
be
entitled
to
impose
the
30-year
sentences.
it
was
never
part
of
the
case.
these
petitioners
were
charged
with
far
more
serious
crimes
than
924(c),
and
the
government
put
its
case
into
trying
to
prove
those
crimes,
and
the
jury
acquitted
them
under
count
1,
conspiracy
to
murder
federal
officers.
count
2
was
aiding
and
abetting
murder
of
federal
agents,
and
they
were
acquitted
of
those
crimes.
they
were
convicted
of
aiding
and
abetting
voluntary
manslaughter.
so
it
was
really
never
part
of
the
case
until
it
came
around
to
sentencing,
and
then
the
government
filed
a
brief
saying
that
we
think
that
this
is
a
sentencing
factor
and
not
an
offense
element,
also
raising
for
the
first
time
the
pinkerton
case
and
trying
to
apply
it
to
sentencing
issues
as
opposed
to
the
type
of
pinkerton
instruction
that
you
give
to
the
jury.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
some
testimony
that
some
people
said
they
heard
machinegun
fire,
and
of
course
this...
the
events
took
place
that
gave
rise
to
the
indictment
on
february
28
of
1993,
but
after
the
tragic
end
on
april
19,
in
which
there
was
a
fire
and
everything
was
destroyed,
there
were
alleged
machineguns
found
on
the
premises.
but
aside
from
that
there
was...
i
mean,
the
evidence
in
regard
to
most
of
these
petitioners
is
that
they
did
have
conventional
firearms,
and
that...
but
they
did
not
fire
any...
there
was
evidence
that
one
of
the
petitioners
did,
but
there's
no
evidence
that
ties
a
machinegun
to
any
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
at
sentencing
the
judge
said
that
there...
some
people
there
had
machineguns,
and
i'm
going
to
hold
these
people
responsible...
these
defendants
responsible
for
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
indicting
them
for
manslaughter
and
then
trying
to
go
back
and
indict
them
again,
after
a
jury
convicts
them
of
manslaughter,
convict
them
of
murder.
i
don't
think
that's
permissible.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
he
just
relied
on
the
transcripts,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct,
in
the
sentencing
aspect,
not
in
terms
of
jury
instructions
where
that
was
found.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
right.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
the
petitioners
by
and
large
were
seen
with...
or
some
of
them
actually
made
statements
to
texas
rangers
after
this
ended
and
they
said,
i
had
a
rifle
or
i
had
a
pistol.
there
was
no
evidence
tying
specific
people
to
machineguns
and...
petitioners,
rather,
and
of
course
we
think
it's
not
what's
in
the
record,
but
what
was
in
the
indictment
and
what
was
in
the
jury
instructions
that
count
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
if
the
court
may
please,
i'd
like
to
return
to
an
earlier
question
by
justice
breyer
about
why,
if
firearm
is
an
offense
element,
that
the
other
types
of
firearms
are
not,
or
why
wouldn't
you
argue
that
all
of
these
are
sentencing
enhancements.
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
second
sentence
in
the
statute
which
refers
to
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
under
this
subsection.
that
was,
of
course,
dealt
with
in
the
deal
case,
so
the
second
sentence
calls
the
first
sentence,
refers
to
being
convicted
under
the
first
sentence,
and
that's
a
statutory
provision,
and
if
you
want
to
talk
about
legislative
history,
when
in
1986
congressman
volkmer
introduced
this
statute
he
said
that
this
imposes
mandatory
sentences
for
firearms
including
machineguns,
so
you
get
that
term,
mandatory
sentencing,
used
a
lot.
in
fact,
you
even
have
that
in
'68,
when
congressman
poff
first
introduced
that
amendment
on
the
house
floor
for
the
1968
legislation,
so
the
fact
that
it's
a
mandatory
sentence
doesn't
tell
you
anything
about
whether
it's
simply
that
the
facts
that
gave
rise
to
that
sentence
constitutes
an
element
versus
a
mere
sentencing
enhancement.
and
if
we
look
very
briefly
at
the
almendarez-torres
situation,
here
we
have
something
that
is
going
to
be
in
evidence.
it's
not
like
it's
prejudicial.
the
gun
has
to
be
in
evidence,
or
there
has
to
be
evidence
about
the
gun.
it's
something
that
one
would
not
say
you
want
to
avoid
prejudice
when
possible.
it's
got
to
be
part
of
the
evidence.
it's
something
that's
contested
frequently,
where
the
recidivism
is
not,
and
once
again
it's
a
traditional
element
of
various
offenses.
whether
it
be
use
of
a
firearm
in
a
crime,
or
unregistered
firearm,
or
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
this
goes
back
to
common
law
and
early
state
practice
that
types
of
firearms
are
offense
elements.
so
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
ask
the
court
to
remand
the
case
for
resentencing
in--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--thank
you.
