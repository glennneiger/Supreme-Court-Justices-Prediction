mr.
james
k.
robinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
purposes
of
sorting
offense
elements
from
sentencing
factors
in
this
case,
we
believe
the
court
should
view
section
924(c)(1)
as
much
more
like
the
reentry
after
deportation
statute
reviewed
in
almendarez-torres
than
the
carjacking
statute
reviewed
in
jones,
and
we
belie
ve
this
for
three
major
reasons.
first,
the
sentencing-enhancing
factors
in
section
924(c)
are
very
different
from
the
carjacking
statute,
particularly
in
their
importance
compared
to
the
core
elements
of
the
offense.
second,
the
sentence-increasing
factor
of
serious
bodily
injury
in
the
carjacking
statute
was
found
by
the
court
in
jones
to
have
been
traditionally
treated
as
an
offense
element
of
aggravated
robbery.
there
is
no
comparable
history
or
tradition
for
treating
firearm
type
in
connection
with
a
crime
of
violence.
and
third,
the
legislative
history
of
section
924(c)
is
far
more
indicative
than
was
the
carjacking
statute
of
an
attempt
by
congress
to
treat
the
sentencing-enhancing
factor
of
firearm
type--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--yes.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
that's
quite
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
way
in
which
that
evolved
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history,
and
when
the
machinegun
clause
provision
was
initially
inserted
into
the
statute
in
1986,
the
original
jump
was
from
5
to
10,
admittedly
a
substantial
one,
and
then
it
was
later
that
this
graduated
scheme
was
put
in
place.
but
i
think
what's
important
here
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
predicate
offenses,
the
predicate
offense,
a
crime
of
violence,
is
one
of
the
elements
of
this
crime,
and
a
jury
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
in
fact
the
defendants
used
a
firearm,
used
or
carried
a
firearm
in
connection
with
that
predicate
offense
and
it
seems
to
us
that,
while
there
is
a
substantial
increase
here,
that
it
is
an...
it's
appropriate
under
these
circumstances
that
the
judge
determine
the
gradation
of
the
firearm
type
that
has
been
found
by
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
it
has
varied,
justice
o'connor.
in
some
circuits
they
have
included
it,
in
others
they
have
not
and,
as
counsel
indicated,
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
as
to
whether
or
not
the
type
of
firearm
must
be
included
in
the
indictments
of
the--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--we...
i
don't
have
the
exact
number.
i
think
that
counsel's
probably
right
that
there's
not
a
lot
of
those
at
the
moment
and,
of
course,
the
current
vision...
version
of
924(c)
increases
the
maximum
penalty
to
life,
and
therefore
it's
a
different
statute
in
that
respect
from
the
one
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
no.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
i
think
that--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--it's
a
long
tail,
and
congress
is
entitled
to
set
out
the
elements,
in
our
view,
of
the
offense
and
to...
and
within
limits
that
have
not
yet,
to
our
understanding,
been
reached.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
it's--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--you
might
have.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
it
seems--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--it
seems
to
me
when
you--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--when
you
go
back
to
the
traditional
means
of
statutory
interpretation
used
by
this
court
in
jones
and
almendarez-torres,
even
in
jones
the
court,
certainly
the
minority
felt
that
the
structure
of
the
statute
was
such--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well,
it's
much
more
than
the
way,
justice
breyer.
the
jury
in
this
case
was
required
to
find
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
murder
federal
agents.
that
had
to
be
found.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
and
that
they
did
so
carrying
or
using
a
firearm,
and
it's
clear
from
the
architecture
of
the
statute
that
those
are
the
two
key
elements
which
makes
up
initially
a
5-year
sentence,
and
then
we're
talking
about
determining
the
means
by
which
that
has
been
accomplished,
and
the
means
here,
according
to
the
way
congress
has
set
out
the
statute,
is
to
differentiate
the
punishment
based
upon
the
dangerousness
of
the
instrumentality.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
we--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--i
think...
i
think
based
upon
the
findings
of
the
court,
the
district
court
in
sentencing,
i
would
say
that
for
one
thing
the
evidence
that
these
petitioners
used
machineguns
and
destructive
devices
was
found
very
substantially
by
the
district
judge
in
the
findings,
based
upon
the
record
that
was
presented
to
the
jury.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
i
think
that
could
happen
under
the
statute,
your
honor.
that's--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--in
this
case,
the
court
specifically
found
the...
that
several
of
the
petitioners
actually...
had
actual
possession
of
a
machinegun,
that
one
had
possession
of
a
destructive
device,
that
all
of
them
had
new,
and
it
was
foreseeable
that
machineguns
were
extensively
used,
as
well
as
destructive
devices,
so
that
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
with
regard
to
the
sentencing
phase,
the
fifth
circuit
found
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that
these
petitioners
used
and
carried
sentence-enhancing
weapons
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well,
i--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--i
think
it
goes
again
to
a
question
of
what's
before
the
court
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
construction
of
924(c).
obviously,
there
is
a
backdrop
of
the
apprendi
matter
that's
pending
before
this
court,
but
i
think
in
the
first
instance
our
obligation
is
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
section
and
ask,
what
did
congress
intend
and
it
seems
to
us
that,
looking
at
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
statute,
congress
intended
there
to
be
two
essential
elements
of
this
offense.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
there
was
no
mandate
from
main
justice
to
the
u.s.
attorneys
to
charge
this
in
a
particular
way
prior
to
the
jones
decision.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
yes,
leading
to
the
split
that's
been
mentioned
in
the
circuits
for
how
this
has
been
handled.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
right.
well,
having
been--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--oh,
we
certainly
try
to
figure
out
what
these
mean
and
provide
advice,
but
having
been
both
a
united
states
attorney
and
now
at
main
justice,
united
states
attorneys'
offices
have
a
fair
amount
of
ability
to
frame
these
things,
and
there
was
no
mandate
that
they
be
charged
in
a
particular
way.
some
guidance
obviously
is
available
through
the
department,
and
particularly
in
connection
with
the
jones
case,
obviously
this
issue
has
been
focused
on
by
main
justice,
and
communication
with
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
yes.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
i
think
so.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that,
much
like
the
court
identified
in
mcmillan,
it
seems
to
me
where
visible
possession
of
a
firearm
in
connection
with
a
violent
crime,
a
violent
felony
was
considered
to
be
an
appropriate
sentencing
factor,
it
seems
to
me
the
gradation,
the
dangerousness
of
the
means,
the
instrumentality,
is
often
considered
by
the
courts.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
the--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well,
but
remember,
justice
breyer,
one
of
the
elements
of
this
crime
is
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
commission
of
a
violent
crime,
and
all
of
its
elements.
that's
part...
if
you
don't...
if
the
government
does
not
prove,
in
this
case
conspiracy
to
murder
federal
agents,
it
as
not
made
out
the
elements
of
the
crime.
on
top--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--taken
up
in
one
trial,
in
which
the
government
must
prove
first
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
murder
federal
agents,
as
charged
in
count
3,
and
in
addition,
the
other
element,
requiring
that
the
government
prove
that
the
defendants,
in
doing
so,
in
relation
to
that
crime
of
violence
carried
or
used
a
firearm.
those
are
the
two
essential
elements,
and
if
that
happens,
it's
our
view
that
the
structure,
language,
and
architecture
of
the
statute
makes
out
a
completed
offense,
and
now
we're
talking
about
sentencing,
and
the
instrumentality--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--that's
the
completed
offense
that
subjects
the
petitioner
to
5
years
and,
if
the
judge
finds
a
machinegun,
first
to
10,
and
then
moved
up
for
purposes
in
1988
to
30
years,
and
in
the
meantime--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--no,
it...
no,
we're...
it's
our
position,
shall
be
sentenced
to
imprisonment.
it
uses
the
word,
sentenced,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
structure,
and
ask
what
are
the
elements
necessary
to
make
up--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--i
think
that
that
would
problematic.
judges
i
think
have
to
find--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--i
would
think
that
often
it...
oftentimes
it
can
be.
i
think
the
court
has
indicated,
and
we're
certainly
not
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
lesser
standard
than
a
preponderance
standard
for
the
judge,
the
same
standard
that's
used
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
to
make
sentencing
determinations,
very
similar
in
many
respects
to
the
kind
of
sentencing
consideration
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
right.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well,
when
you
say
it's
the
same
as
in
jones,
your
honor,
in
jones,
even
the
jones
majority
looked
at
the
carjacking
statute,
which
admittedly
has
a
similar
structure
and
said,
it
has
the
look
of
sorting
these
things
to
sentencing
factors,
and
then
the
court
i
think,
and
the
reason
why
i
think
the
distinction
between
the
carjacking
statute
and
the
reentry
statute
is
critical
in
deciding
how
to
come
out
in
this
case,
is
taking
a
look
at
the
means
or
instrumentality...
type
of
firearm
here...
and
saying,
in
our
view
it's
very
different
to
the
kinds
of
things
that
were
involved
in
jones,
which
included
serious
bodily
injury
or
death,
on
the
one
hand.
and
also
it
seems
to
us
there
was
a
much
stronger
tradition
of
treating
those
kinds
of
things
as
necessarily
elements
of
aggravated
robbery,
which
is
not
the
case...
there's
no
long
tradition
of
treating
means
or
instrumentalities,
firearm
type,
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
and
then
finally
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
to
us,
is
also
very
supportive.
the
way
in
which
this
evolved,
as
well
as
the
language
used
during
the
course
of
the
debates,
indicates
that
when
these
amendments
were
added,
the
amendments
that
were
added
in
'86
and
'88
and
'94,
those
were
added
adding
increases
to
the
sentence
in
addition
to
putting
in
an
additional
type
of
dangerous
firearm,
namely
a
short-barreled
shotgun
or
rifle,
indicating
congressional
intent
to
treat
the
type
of
firearm,
namely
the
means
or
instrumentalities
of
committing
the
underlying
offense,
as,
in
fact,
sentencing
considerations
rather
than
elements.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
certainly
there's
references
to
this
as
increasing
prison
terms,
increasing
punishment.
there's
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
there
was
any
intent
to
create
multiple,
separate
offenses
under
these
statutes.
and
i
think
the
other
thing
that's
important
is
that,
unlike
the
jones
case,
where
i
think
you
cannot
easily
say
that
serious
bodily
injury
or
death
was
subsumed
within
any
elements
found
by
the
jury,
here
we
have
jury
findings
of
the
use
and
carrying
of
a
firearm,
any
firearm,
including
these,
in
the
commission
of
a
violent
crime.
and
so
what
the
judge
is
doing,
and
here
on
the
same
record
in
which
there
was
strong
evidence
of
the
use
of
machineguns
and
destructive
devices,
making
a
finding
of
the
type
of
sort
of
firearms
being
used--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well,
as
a...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
though,
that
in
the
context...
as
the
court
said
in
mcmillan,
that
as
the...
the
type
or
means
of
instrumentality
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
is
a
traditional
sentencing
consideration
for
determining
how
much
punishment
should
be
imposed
after
the
jury
has
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
basis
of
core
elements
that
are
clearly...
stand
on
their
own
bottom
as
an
offense,
namely,
the
predicate
crime
of
violence
and
the
using
and
carrying
of
firearm.
it
isn't
as
if
congress
said
we're
going
to
leave
the
whole
question
of
the
firearm
to
the
judge.
the
jury
had
to
find
the
use
and
carrying
of
firearms
to
commit
the
predicate
offense.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
i
think
that
if
that
were
to
be
the
case,
then...
and
if
the
court
were
to
limit
the
exception,
if
it
should,
to
recidivism
in
almendarez-torres,
it
would
make...
the
court
would
have...
be
confronted
with
a
situation
in
which
this
sentence
enhancement
would
be
constitutionally
problematic.
if
footnote
6
in
the
jones
opinion
is
adopted
as
a
new
principle
of
constitutional
law,
this
would
seem
to
me
to
be
problematic
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
no,
i
think
not.
i
certainly
agree
with
mr.
halbrook
that
it
wouldn't
invalidate
the
conviction.
it
would
have
a...
an
impact
on
the
sentence,
and
obviously
we
think
that
then
the
question
would
be,
if
this
was
an
element...
if
the
court
were
to
determine
this
was
an
element,
read
924(c)
as
requiring
this
to
be
an
element,
then
it
seems
to
me
what
would
have
to
happen
is
that
there
would
be
a
remand
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
failure
to
charge
this
element
in
this
case
was
harmless
error.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
i
would
say
in
the
first
instance
my
answer
would
be
no,
you
don't
have
that
power,
except
you
do
have
the
power
to
interpret
a
statute
to
avoid
an
unconstitutional
result,
and
if
it
was
clear--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--yes.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
on
apprendi
broadly,
the
court
could
take
a
look
at
924(c)
and
address
this
issue,
but--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--probably.
the--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--well,
we
think
that
it
is
the
court's
obligation
to
determine
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
i
mean,
we
think
that
the...
that
the
doctrine
of...
that
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt,
if
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here--
mr.
james
k.
robinson
--no.
mr.
james
k.
robinson
well,
obviously,
we
don't
think
that's
the
case
here.
we
think
that
the
statute
does
make
this
a
sentencing
element,
and
as
a...
if
the
court
were
to
make
that
determination,
it
would
have
to
make
that
finding,
and
the
principle
that
you're
suggesting,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
does
dive
pretty
heavily
into
guessing,
perhaps,
what
was
intended,
and...
but
if
the...
if
your...
if
the
question
is,
in
the
case
i
just
can't
figure
it
out
one
way
or
the
other
which
way
it
ought
to
go,
i
ought
to
put
it
on
the
offense
side,
i
understand
that
that's
one
approach
that
could
be
taken.
in
our
view,
fairly
interpreted,
congress
did
intend
the
type
of
firearm
used
to
commit
the
predicate
offense
here,
the
conspiracy
to
murder
federal
agents
under
section
924(c),
to
be
a
sentencing
factor
for
the
court
and
not
an
offense
element
to
be
decided
by
the
jury.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
upholding
the
petitioner's
sentences
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
