you're
saying
that
if
we
find
it's
an
element,
the
crime
charge
is
a
product
of
the
elements
charged,
and
if
an
element
necessary
to
make
it
a
graver
as
opposed
to
a
lesser
included
offense
was
omitted,
then
it's
only
the
lesser
included
offense--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
was
charged
and
the
subject
of
the
conviction.
justice
david

souter
and
the
machinegun
was
attributed
to
your
client
under
pinkerton?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
it
also--
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is...
i
think
that
assumes
a
different
premise
from
justice
scalia's
question.
i...
we
can
do
that
if
we
think
there
is
some
leeway--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
think
there
is
some
question
about
it,
but
if
we
conclude
without
any
doubt
that
it
was
intended
to
be
an
element,
then
i
think
we're
simply
stuck
and
the
statute
to
that
extent
is
unconstitutional,
don't
you?
