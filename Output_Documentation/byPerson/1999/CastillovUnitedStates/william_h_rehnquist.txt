chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-658,
jaime
castillo
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
halbrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
are
the
basic
elements
of
the
offense,
the
5-year
thing,
mr.
halbrook?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
crime
of
violence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
said
it
three
times,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
happen
here,
mr.
halbrook...
if
we
rule
for
you,
you
say
the
conviction
wouldn't
have
to
be
set
aside,
but
suppose
the
government
wants
to
show
again
that
this
was
one
of
the
kind
of
firearms
that
would
justify
a
sentence
greater
than
5
years,
does
the
government
have
to
prove
just
that?
it
would
have
to
prove
it
to
a
jury,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
double
jeopardy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
happily
if
we
reverse
the
judgment
here
the
court
of
appeals
can
address
that
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
the
only
permissible
sentence
being
5
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
transcript
show
with
respect
to...
i
mean,
ordinarily
someone
doesn't
get
up
on
the
stand
and
say,
i
saw
him
with
a
firearm.
they
say,
i
saw
him
with
a
machinegun,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
saw
him
with
a
shotgun
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
halbrook.
mr.
robinson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
robinson--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--one
of
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
majority
in
almendarez-torres
was
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania,
which
sustains
some
sentencing
factors
like
this,
but
it
also
said
in
that
case
that
one
of
the
limitations
was
that
the
tail
couldn't
wag
the
dog.
here
you
have
a
jury
finding
that
would
justify
5
years
imprisonment,
but
you
have
judicial
sentencing
factor
findings
that
can
go
up
to
30
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
separate
trial,
or
are
all
of
these
taken
up
in
the
same
indictment,
same
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about,
say,
a
case
where
there's
been
a
homicide,
and
there
was
evidence
that
a
jury
could
have
found
manslaughter
or
could
have
found
second
degree
murder,
or
could
have
found
first
degree
murder.
you
wouldn't
say,
well,
we'll
just
let
the
judge
pick
and
choose
people,
and
one
gets
10
years
and
the
other
gets
executed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robinson.
mr.
halbrook,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
halbrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-658,
castillo
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
