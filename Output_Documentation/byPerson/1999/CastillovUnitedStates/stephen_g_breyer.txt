justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
the
only
court
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sorry.
i
didn't...
were
you
about
to
say
something
in
response?
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
the
only
court
of
appeals
that
has
held
that
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
the
problem
with
the
dog
and
the
tail
that's
worrying
me
so
much
as
a
different
problem,
which
is
that
this
is
a
statute
that
you
might
have
said
that
the
whole
statute
is
simply
a
sentencing
factor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
might
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
looking
at
it
as
a
whole,
it
seems
it
isn't,
and
so
if
it
is
creating
a
crime
out
of
carrying
a
gun
somewhere
in
relation
to
a
different
crime,
it's
pretty
hard
to
see,
given
the
numbers,
and
given
the
qualitative
difference
between
handling
a
machinegun
or
a
bomb
and
a
pistol,
why
this
suddenly
becomes
a
sentencing
factor.
it's
not
really
written
that
way.
it's...
i
mean,
you
have
three
separate
things.
the
numbers
are
different,
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
here,
which
is
the
carrying
of
the
weapon,
not
the
other
crime,
why
wouldn't
you
say
just
what
your
opponent
said?
that's
what's
bothering
me,
that
what
they
have
here
is,
they
have
three
separate
things.
if
you
have
a
drug
crime
and
you
have
a
pistol,
it's
5
years.
if
you
have
a
drug
crime
and
have
a
rifle,
it's
10.
if
you
have
a
bomb
or
a
machinegun,
it's
30.
i
mean,
they
all
look
like,
as
they're
lined
up...
i
don't
know
how
to
argue
it
exactly.
it's
just,
when
you
read
this
statute,
how
does
it
look?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thing
that's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
one
of
those,
and
i
did,
but
there
i
thought
that
carjacking
is
the
basic
crime,
and
that
the...
whether
you
hurt
somebody
or
not
in
the
course
is
rather
a
typical
sentencing
factor
that
has
to
do
with
the
manner.
but
here,
the
underlying
thing
is
a...
is
new,
and
unique,
and
special,
created
by
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore
it
becomes
somewhat
harder
for
me
to
see
this
as
a
traditional,
or...
a
traditional
way
of
punishing
somebody
for
the
way
in
which
he
carried
out
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
now,
if
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
the...
can
you
think
of...
i'm...
we're
all
obviously
struggling
with
the
way
to
approach
these
cases,
but
i...
and
thinking
of
looking
at
the
underlying
crime
and
asking,
faced
with
ambiguous
statutory
structure
and
language,
is
there
a
tradition,
a
tradition
of
using
this
kind
of
factor
as
a
sentencing
factor
in
respect
to
the
underlying
crime,
or
is
there
legislative
history,
or
does
it
put
the
defense
in
some
kind
of
impossible
situation,
i.e.,
to
have
to
prove,
for
example,
i
didn't
do
it,
but
nonetheless
it
was
just
a...
you
see...
you
have
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
any
of
those
things
in
your
favor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
underlying
crime
here
is
not
the
crime
of
violence
or
drugs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
underlying
crime
here
is
this
new
statutory
invention,
called
possessing
a
gun
in
relation
to,
or
during
the
crime
of
violence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
a
difference
between
the
legislative
history
in
respect
to
these
add-on...
the
machinegun
from
what
the
legislative
history
was
when
they
created
the
basic
crime?
that
is,
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
both
places
what
they
say
in
effect
is,
we're
going
to
be
sure
that
people
who
have
these
guns
when
they
commit
crimes
will
be
in
prison
for
a
long
time,
and
if
the
first
creates
a
separate
crime,
why
doesn't
the
second,
third,
and
fourth?
is
there
a
qualitative
difference
in
the
legislative
history
in
respect
to
those
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
a
rule
of
statutory
interpretation,
what
would
you
think
of
saying
that
where
the
statute
leaves
it
open
to
real
doubt,
and
where
you
can't
find
much
help
in
tradition
or
history,
and
where
a
significant
amount
of
years
turns
on
it,
you
should
assume
that
it's
meant
to
be
an
element
at
least
where
it's
not
going
to
cause
serious
problems
for
trying
a
case
for
the
defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
and
so
i'm
hypothesizing
that
it's
pretty
tough,
because
the
statute
itself
doesn't
tell
you,
the
history
turns
out
to
be
somewhat
ambiguous,
you
can't
appeal
to
tradition,
and
there's
no
particular
problem
created
for
the
defense
in...
you
know,
as
there
might
be
in
the
drug
statutes,
for
example.
why
not
follow
that
approach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
saying
straight,
and
i'd
say
straight,
other
things
being
equal,
congress
probably
intends
juries
to
consider
these
factual
matters
where
a
significant
number
of
years
turns
on
it,
other
things
being
equal.
the
statute
doesn't
tell
you,
the
language
doesn't,
history
doesn't,
and
there's
no
particular
problem
with
trying
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
focuses
on
a
federal
criminal
statute
that
prohibits
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
“firearm”
during
or
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence.
the
statute
says
that
in
addition
to
the
punishment
provided
for
the
underlying
crime
of
violence
the
offender
“shall
be
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
five
years
if
he
uses
or
carries
a
firearm",
then
it
adds,
"and
if
the
firearm
is
a
machinegun,
to
imprisonment
for
30
years."
the
question
is
whether
that
statutory
word
“machinegun”
or
various
other
kinds
of
specifically
listed
firearm
types,
whether
it
designates
a
separate
crime
in
which
case
the
government
has
to
charge
the
element
machinegun
in
an
indictment
and
prove
it
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
whether
it
simply
sets
forth
a
sentencing
factor
i.e.
a
reason
for
increasing
the
sentence
which
a
judge
not
the
jury
would
determine.
we
recently
considered
similar
questions
involving
other
statutes
in
cases
called
jones
v.
united
states
and
almendarez-torres
v.
united
states,
both
of
which
involved
discussions
of
statutory
interpretation
as
well
as
congress’
power
under
the
constitution
to
permit
judges
rather
than
juries
to
determine
particular
factual
matters.
in
this
case
however
we
do
not
invoke
the
constitutional
principles
rather
we
simply
use
traditional
tools
of
statutory
analysis
considering
language,
structure,
context,
and
history
of
the
statute
along
with
such
other
factors
as
typically
help
a
court
to
determine
what
congress’
intent
was,
and
we
conclude
that
congress
intended
the
factual
matter
at
issue
whether,
what
the
offender
used
was
a
machinegun,
but
it
intended
that
to
be
an
element
of
a
separate
crime,
not
the
sentencing
factor.
that
being
so
where
the
government
seeks
the
mandatory
20
or
30-year
prison
sentences
prescribed
by
the
statute
for
certain
firearm
types
the
government
has
to
charge
the
type
of
firearm
as
an
element
in
the
indictment
and
prove
it
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
federal
court
of
appeals
below
which
had
reached
the
different
conclusions.
we
explained
all
this
in
considerably
greater
detail
in
our
opinion,
and
except
for
the
discussion
of
legislative
history
which
appears
in
part
two
of
the
opinion
which
justice
scalia
does
not
join;
with
that
exception
our
decision
is
unanimous.
