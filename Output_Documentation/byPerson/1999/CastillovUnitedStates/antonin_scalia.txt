and
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
that,
you're
prepared
to
lose
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
don't
make
a
constitutional
argument.
if
we
disagree
with
you
that,
as
set
forth
in
this
statute,
these
matters
were
meant
to
be
elements
of
the
offense,
if
we
think
that
they
were
meant
to
be
sentencing
factors,
you're
content
to
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
will
not
make
the
argument
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
a
strange
argument
you're
making,
that
you
say
there's...
it's
constitutionally
doubtful,
and
therefore
we
should
interpret
it
this
way,
but
if
we
don't
interpret
it
that
way,
well,
you
don't
have
any
constitutional
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
don't
have
any
constitutional
argument,
i
guess
it's
not
constitutionally
doubtful.
i
mean,
i
find
it
extraordinary
that
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
make
the
statutory
argument
you're
making
without
reaching
the
conclusion
that
if
it's
rejected
there's
at
least
a
constitutional
issue
that
we
ought
to
consider,
but
you
don't
want
it
consider
it,
that's
okay.
you're
right,
you've
said
it
three
times.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
my
hypothetical's
the
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
the...
even
if
it
didn't
go
to
the
jury,
somebody
thought
that
it
was
more
likely
than
not
that
they
had
machineguns.
what
was
that
based
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
may
be
the
dog
rather
than
the
tail?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
it
still...
is
even
the
dog.
from
5
years
to
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
long
tail.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
didn't
go
to
the
jury,
and
you
don't
find
it
strange
that
what
goes
to
the
jury
is
a
finding
that
they
have
to
make
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
accounts
for
only
5
years
of
the
individual
sentence,
and
then
what
is
decided
by
a
judge,
without
the
protection
of
a
jury,
and
just
on
the
basis
of
a
preponderance...
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
they
had
machineguns...
not
on
the
basis
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
going
to
account
for
25
more
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
strange
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
any
coordinating
mechanism
in
the
justice
department
for
deciding
what...
you
know,
we
have
a
single
federal
statute
which
presumably
means
the
same
thing
in
all
the
districts
of
the
united
states,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--main
justice
doesn't
try
to
figure
out
what
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
know,
you're
putting
stress
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
says,
and
if
it
is
a
machinegun,
shall
be
sentenced
to,
and
if
it
is
a
rifle,
shall
be
sentenced
to.
that
doesn't
carry
any
water,
because
it
says
that
with
regard
to
the
basic,
what
you
say
is
the
basic
underlying
crime
as
well.
it
nowhere
says,
it
is
criminal
to
use,
to
carry
a
firearm
in
the
commission
of
these
offenses.
it
says
that
if
you
do
it,
you
will
be
sentenced
to
5
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
the
same
language
is
applied
to
the
10-year
acceleration
and
to
the
30-year.
why
aren't
they
all
parallel?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
as
in
jones.
it's
really
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
consequence
of
that
would
be
to
invalidate
the
entire
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
could
the
court
make
it
an
element
if
congress
has,
as
you
said,
written
a
statute
in
which
it
is
not
an
element
but
a
sentencing
factor?
i
mean,
do
we
have
the
power,
by
finding
that
a
sentencing
factor
would
be
unconstitutional,
to
convert
it
from
a
sentencing
factor
to
an
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
change
your
argument
in
that--
