justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
there's
any
constitutional
doubt
about
the
validity
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
halbrook,
at
what
stage
of
the
proceeding...
you
said
it
wasn't
alleged
in
the
indictment.
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
was
your
client
first
notified
that
the
government
contended
he
used
a
machinegun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
judge
take
additional
evidence
to...
on
the
machinegun
issue,
or
did
he
rely
on
the
transcript?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
procedure:
supposing
all
of
the
evidence
presented
to
the
jury
dramatically
showed
they
used
rifles
and
then,
after
the
trial
was
over,
in
the
presentence
study,
the
parole
officer
or
whoever
made
the
presentence
report
said,
well,
we've
now
found
evidence
they
were
actually
using
machineguns,
and
they
came
in
and
brought
that
evidence
to
the
judge.
i
assume
under
the
statute
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
judge
from
saying,
i
think
that's
right,
they
should
get
the
30
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
if
the
judge
finds.
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
even
require
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
what
if
he
had...
just
had
probable
cause?
couldn't
he
still
say,
i
think
this
is
right,
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
would
it
be
problematic?
in
most
sentencing
factors
the
judge
just...
he
can
act
on
less
than
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
if
he's
persuaded
by
the
parole
officer
or
the
presentence
report.
isn't
that
enough,
normally?
