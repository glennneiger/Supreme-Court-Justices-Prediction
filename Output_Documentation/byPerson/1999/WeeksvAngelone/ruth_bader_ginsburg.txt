mr.
olive,
the
pattern
instructions
have
been
changed
since
the
one
the
court
inspected
in
angelone,
and
they
are
clearer
now
on
the
point
that...
that
you're
raising.
how
do
the...
how
did
that
change
come
about?
what
precipitated
the
change
so
that
now
the
jury
would
get
a
clearer
answer
had
they
come
in
with
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olive,
i
thought
in
response
to
the
2254(d)
that
you
were
relying
on
boyde
to
say
that
if
the
jury
misunderstood
to
the
extent
that
it
wasn't
going
to
take
mitigating
factors
into
account--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
that
would
be
reversible...
cause
for
reversal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
anderson--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
anderson,
may
i
back
you
up
a
bit?
because
you
said
the
instruction
that
was
given
at
195
goes
beyond
what
is
the
instruction
today.
the
instruction
today
on
mitigation
is
very
clear.
it
says
that
even
if
the
commonwealth
had
proved
beyond
reasonable
doubt
the
existence
of
an
aggravating
circumstance,
the
jury
must,
nonetheless,
consider
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
weigh
that
against
the
aggravator,
precisely
what
was
lacking
in
this
case.
so,
i
can
understand
your
argument
when
you
say
this
instruction
was
enough,
but
for
you
to
say
that
it
went
beyond
what
today
would
be
told
to
a
virginia
jury
i
think
is
quite
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
this
is
one
is
labeled
capital
murder
bifurcated
penalty
trial
mitigation.
that's
the
one
i
just
read
to
you.
then
there's
the
other
change
in
the
capital
murder,
one
aggravator
instruction.
so,
there
were
two
changes
that
were
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
say
anything
about
if
you
find
one
aggravator
nonetheless.
that's
what
was
missing
from
the
old
instruction
and
is
present
in
the
new
one.
