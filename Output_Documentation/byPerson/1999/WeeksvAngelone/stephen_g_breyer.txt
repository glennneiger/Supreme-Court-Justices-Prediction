justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
the...
sorry.
were
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
ambiguity
was
with
the
word
justified.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
thought
it
read
if
you
find
the
commonwealth
has
proved
aggravators
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
you
may
fix
the
punishment
at
death,
or
if
you
believe,
from
all
the
evidence,
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified,
then
you
shall
fix
the
punishment
at
life.
i
suppose
somebody
hearing
that
might
think
if
i
find
the
alternatives,
it's
death.
if
i
don't
find
the
alternatives,
it's
life.
wasn't
that
the
ambiguity
that's
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
a
lawyer
may
know
that
the
word
justified
refers
to
mitigators,
which
word
never
appears.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
does
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--four
members
of
the
court
thought
it
was...
you
were
right
on
it
being
ambiguous
on
itself.
five--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
five
didn't.
so,
it's
okay.
the
instruction
is
okay.
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
you
can't
have
a
rule
of
law
that
says
whenever
a
juror
doesn't
find
an
okay...
you
know,
whenever
a
juror
is
confused,
the
judge
can
never
just
refer
them
back
to
an
okay
instruction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
couldn't
be
the
rule
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore,
this
case,
if
you're
going
to
win
it,
must
have
a
clear
factor
about
it
that
makes
this
special
and
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
your
point...
is
your
point...
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
though
i
suppose
i
will
be,
but
i
mean,
if
their
confusion
is
they
do
not
know
if
the
two
words,
not
justified,
refer
to
absence
of
aggravators
or
presence
of
mitigators,
if
that's
their
confusion,
i
guess
reading
those
two
words,
not
justified,
10
million
times
will
not
clear
up
the
confusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why...
suppose
it
isn't
that.
suppose,
for
example,
a
totally
different
case.
there's
a
state
law
problem.
you
have
a
terrifically
adequate,
perfect,
wonderful
instruction,
and
it
happens
to
use
the
word
abscond.
and
the
jury
comes
in
and
says,
judge,
we
know
that
most
people
would
know
what
this
means
and,
unfortunately,
our
english
teacher
in
high
school...
four
of
us
had
a
terrible
teacher.
and
we
just
haven't
a
clue
what
that
means.
just
please
tell
us
what
it
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
the
judge
says,
i'll
tell
you
what
you
do:
go
read
the
instruction.
now,
would
that
be
reversible
error
in
a
virginia
court?
it
happens
to
be
that
abscond
is
the
whole
key
to
the
case.
would
it
happen
to
be
reversible
error?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
they
might
reverse
that.
fine.
if
that...
if
in
fact
there's
a
judgment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
that
the
jury
have
a
meaning
of
what
abscond
is,
would
you
say
maybe
there
was
a
constitutional
issue
in
that
case?
nothing
wrong
with
the
instruction
in
general,
just
in
this
case
because
the
jury
has
made
it
totally
clear
they
haven't
a
clue
what
the
key
word
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
making
it
as
a
hypothetical.
so,
i
haven't
talked
about
this
case
yet.
so,
don't
disagree
with
the
premise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
my
case
with
abscond,
would
you
say
that
it
was
reversible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i'll
give
you
as
much
context
as
you'd
like.
the...
i
make
it
up
as
i
go
along.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
you
imagine
the
context.
it
happens
the
word
is
absolutely
key
to
the
case.
there...
courts
and
the
cases
under
the
constitution,
one
called
pocket
i
think,
not
lockett,
which
happens
to
say
that
the
word
abscond
is
100
percent
must
be
clear
in
the
jury's
mind.
the
instruction
is
perfect.
the
jury
just
happens
to
say,
because
of
our
english
teacher,
we
haven't
a
clue
what
this
word
means.
now,
do
you
have
to
say
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
does
the
judge
have
more
of
an
obligation
to
explain
it
than
another
juror?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--leaving
the
teacher
out
of
it,
if...
if
he
referred
just
to
that
one
sentence,
then
it's
rather
hard
to
see
the
decisional
tree
that
was
necessary
to
do
the
clarification
because
a
key
part
of
that
decisional
tree
comes
in
the...
in
the
later
sentence
to
which
he
did
not
refer.
am
i
right
about
that?
