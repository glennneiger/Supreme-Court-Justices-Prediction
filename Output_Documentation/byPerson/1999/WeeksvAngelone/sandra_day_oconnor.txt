well,
i
think
that
may
be
reading
more
into
the
question
than
is
justified.
i
think
it
may
be
a
reasonably
common
practice
for
trial
judges,
when
faced
with
a
question
from
a
jury
about
an
instruction,
to
refer
the
jurors
back
to
a
particular
instruction
if
the
trial
judge
thinks
that
it's...
that
it
properly
answers
the
question.
and
maybe
they
just
haven't
focused
on
that
aspect
of
it.
is
that
not
a
practice
that
occurs
not
infrequently
in
trial
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we...
do
we
also
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances,
the
arguments
of
both
counsel
and
any
other
instructions
that
are
included
in
the
packet?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
may
carry
some
weight.
i'm
concerned
that
in
this
case
both
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
made
clear
during
their
closing
arguments
that
the
jury
was
free
to
impose
a
life
sentence
if
they
wished,
despite
finding
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seems
to
me
really
a
re-argument
of
buchanan,
and
i
thought
this
court
in
buchanan
had
said
that
instruction
was...
was
proper.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i...
i
really
think
i'm
hearing
you
suggest
that
we
should
adopt
the
view
of
the
dissenters
in
buchanan,
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
do
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr....
mr.
olive,
is
this
a
case
controlled
by
aedpa,
the...
the
new
statute
dealing
with
post-conviction
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
section
2254(d)(1)
is
applicable--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--then
we
would
have
to
say
and
determine
here
that
the
virginia
supreme
court,
in
denying
the
claim,
rendered
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
this
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i'm
troubled
by
that
because
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
we
have
articulated
anything
about
a
duty
to
instruct
in
different
terms
rather
than
call
a
jury's
attention
to
an
instruction
the
court
believes
covers
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
i...
i
don't
see
how
we're...
if...
if
aedpa
applies,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
meet
the
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
concede
that...
back
away
from
this
case...
not
this
case.
is
it
possible
that
a
perfectly
valid
instruction
could
be
given
in
a
criminal
case
and
a
jury
could
inquire
of
a
judge
and
indicate
such
confusion
that
some
clarification
might
be
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
test
we
had
articulated
was
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misunderstood
its
ability
to
consider
the
mitigating
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
that
as
the
test?
