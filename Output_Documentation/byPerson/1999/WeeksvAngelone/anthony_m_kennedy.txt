we're

we

look
it,
it's
in

if
you
read
the
statute

we've
considered
this
and
it's
there.

follow-up.

i'm

of

the

gave
the
comment

justice
anthony

may
i...
may
i
ask
a
question
just
on
the
background
facts
of
this
case?
at
196
of
the
joint
appendix,
volume
ii,
you
give
us
two
of
the
verdict
forms
that
i
assume
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
one
at
the
top
of
196
indicates
that
there
would
be
a
death
penalty
because
the
jury
unanimously
found
that
there
would
be
future
dangerousness.
and
the
second
one
has
future
dangerousness
and
vileness.
was
there
a
third
one
for
just
vileness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seemed
to
me
that
it's...
one
way
to
read
what
the
jury
said
is...
is
in
effect
this.
judge,
if
we
have
found
that
this
was
a
vile
crime
and
we
are...
have
voted
to
what
they
call
issue
the
death
penalty
in
their
term...
to
issue
the
death
penalty
on
that,
do
we
have
to
go
and
talk
about
future
dangerousness?
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
plausible
way
to
read
their...
their
concern.
and
the
answer
it
seemed
to
me
doesn't
make
much
difference
if...
if
they've...
if
they've
agreed
on
the
death
penalty.
justice
anthony

kennedy
well,
i...
i
thought
the
question
was...
was
a
little
bit
confusing.
and
i
thought
that
that
was
at
least
one
interpretation
of
the
question.
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
hurts
your
case.
