mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
let
me
deal
with
the
buchanan
holding
and
counsel's
suggestion
today
that
the
holding
in
buchanan
upholding
the
validity
of
the
model
jury
instruction
that
was
given
verbatim
in
this
case
somehow
was
something
less
than
an
unqualified
holding.
counsel
today,
for
example,
talks
about
that
the
instruction
was
ambiguous
but
not
wrong,
and
he
refers
to
this
ambiguity
being
recognized
by
the
dissenters
in
buchanan.
but
in
the
fourth
circuit,
after
buchanan
had
been
decided,
weeks
repeatedly
indicated
in
his
brief
and
his
other
post-opinion
pleadings
that
buchanan
had,
in
fact,
upheld
and
made
clear
the
facial
validity
of
the
model
jury
instruction.
he
didn't
say
anything
along
the
lines
of,
well,
in
certain
contexts
the
instruction
would
be
okay,
but
not
in
others.
it
was
just
a
flat-out
acknowledgement
of
the
obvious,
that
the
holding
in
buchanan
was,
in
fact,
a
holding
on
the
merits
and
made
clear
that
the
jury
instruction
adequately
explicated
to
the
jury
its
sentencing
options.
in
his
cert
petition...
and
this
court
in
buchanan
talked
about
the
model
instruction
establishing
a
decision.
i
think
the
words
were
a
simple
decisional
tree.
and
weeks
in
his
cert
petition
echoed...
he
parroted
that
very
language.
he
said
much
the
same,
that
the
model
instruction
given
in...
in
the
case
and
that
the
court
referred
the
jury
back
to,
that
it
established
this
decisional
tree
that
a
juror
ought
to
understand.
the
cart
petition
was
premised
upon
a
facially
valid
jury
charge,
and
the
question
was,
well,
if
you
have
a
facially
valid
jury
charge,
but
the
jury,
nevertheless,
asked
a
question
about
that,
where
does
that
leave
you?
what
sort
of
duty
does
the
judge
have
with
respect
to
dealing
with
that?
but
the
point
is
the
cert
petition
specifically
presupposed
the
facial
validity
of
the
jury
charge
for
purposes
of
this
case.
and
this
court
has
made
clear
in
any
number
of
cases
that
where
you
have
a
premise
in
a
cert
petition,
such
as
the
one
i've
just
said,
that
you
can't
later
try
to
wiggle
away
from
that
and
say,
well,
that's
not
really
the
premise--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
i'm--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
that
that's
why
they...
they
asked
the
question.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
it's...
it's--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--and
it
was
a
very
eloquent
dissent,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
let's
go
to
the
dissent
in
buchanan.
it
was...
it
was
a
6-3
vote,
and
it's
very
interesting
because
the
dissenting
opinion
repeatedly,
or
at
least
several
times,
talked
in
terms...
it
didn't
say
the
instruction
was
just
flat-out
wrong
or
constitutionally
deficient.
it
said
it
was
overly
ambiguous.
but
it
said
several
times
in
the
course
of
that
dissent
that
if
there
had
been
an
instruction
on
mitigation,
that
would
have
handled
the
matter.
that
would
have
made
it
clear
to
the
jury.
we
have
a
mitigation
instruction
here...
and
this
is
one
of
the
two
differences
between
this
case
and
buchanan
which
otherwise,
for
purposes
of
the
present
case,
is...
is
so
similar
in
terms
of
procedural
incidents.
but
we
have
in...
in
buchanan...
excuse
me...
in
this
case
in
distinct
contrast
to
buchanan,
which
was
one
of
the
primary
complaints
there,
an
instruction
on
mitigation
that
went
well
beyond
what
is
even
the
model
instruction
in
virginia
today
on
mitigation.
it
said...
and
this
is
at
195
of
the
appendix,
and
it
goes
on
in
the
first
paragraph
to
define
mitigation
evidence
generally.
it
says
in
the
final
sentence
of
that
paragraph,
the
law
requires
your
consideration
of
more
than
the
bare
facts
of
the
crime.
and
considering
in
this
case
that
the
only
factor,
aggravating
factor,
found
by
the
jury
was
vileness,
that's
another
way
of
saying,
you
have
to
consider
more
than
the...
the
vileness
of
the
murder.
then
the
second--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the...
at
the
rest
of
it.
the--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--the...
the
final
paragraph,
the
first
sentence
says,
you
must
consider
a
mitigating
circumstance
if
you
find
there
is
evidence
to
support
it.
now,
the
argument
here,
your
honor...
it's
very
important
to
bear
in
mind.
the
argument
consistently
and
exclusively
has
been
that
the
answer...
there's
never
been
any
claim,
and
there
couldn't
be,
that
this
jury
ever
received
any
misinformation
from...
from
the
trial
judge,
from
the
commonwealth's
attorney,
from
defense
counsel
on
such
basic
principles
as
the
fact
that
you
have
two
sentencing
options
in
the
sentencing
phase,
life
and
death,
that
the
death
penalty
under
no
circumstances
is
mandatory,
that
the
life
sentence
under
a
certain
circumstance
is,
and
that
under
any
circumstances,
you
must
consider
the
mitigating
evidence.
but
the
argument
has
been
that
the
answer
didn't
go
far...
not
that
the
answer
was
wrong,
but
the
answer
was...
didn't
go
far
enough
and
left
open
too
much
possibility
that
the
jury
would
disregard
the
mitigating
evidence.
period.
not
that
it
might
consider
the
mitigating
evidence
in
some
fashion,
but
that
it...
but
that
it's
consideration
was
too
restrictive
a
la,
say,
for
example,
in...
in
penry.
and
those...
those
are
very
different
matters.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
we...
we
have
two
different
model
instructions
here,
and
i...
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
one
you're
alluding
to
is
the
model
instruction
dealing...
the
current
version
of
what
was
instruction
2
in
this
case,
which
is
if
you
find
aggravating
evidence
and
then
if
you
find
mitigating
evidence,
et
cetera.
the
model
instruction
i'm
referring
to
is
the
virginia
model
instruction
on
mitigation.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
the
model...
i
have
what
i
understand
to
be
the
current
model
jury
instruction
in
virginia
on
mitigation
which
simply
says,
if
you
find
that
the
commonwealth
has
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
existence
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
determining
the
appropriate
punishment,
you
should
consider
any
evidence
presented
of
circumstances
which
do
not
justify
or
excuse
the
offense,
but
which
in
fairness
or
mercy
may
extenuate
or
reduce
the
degree
of
moral
culpability
and
punishment.
that's
the
one
i'm
alluding
to.
and
the
instruction
here,
which
in
the
second
paragraph
detailed
a
number
of
examples
of
mitigation--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
of
course,
the...
the
old
instruction
six
members
of
the
court...
and
as
weeks
repeatedly
conceded...
the
old
instruction--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
i--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
but
the...
the
point
is,
your
honor...
and
it
seems
to
me
the
underlying
premise
in...
in
many
respects
of
this
appeal...
is
that
the
asking
of
the
question
was
some
sort
of
extraordinary
development
that...
that
basically
rendered
both
before
and
after
everything
in
this
case
essentially
meaningless.
and
it
changed
the
case
for
good.
but
we
cited
many
cases--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--no.
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
yes,
justice
o'connor.
suppose,
for
example,
the
jury
either
in
an
initial
question
or,
say,
a
follow-up
question...
of
course,
it's
highly
revealing
that
there
was
no
follow-up
question
here.
but
suppose
the
jury
had
not
merely
asked
the
question
in
general
terms...
and
by
the
way,
the
question
didn't
say,
we've
reviewed
instruction
number
2
repeatedly
and
we
now
ask
the
following
question.
it
did
not
advert
to
the
instructions
at
all.
it
simply
asked
in
general
terms
if
we
find
an
aggravating
factor,
basically
where
does
that
leave
us?
do
we
go
ahead
and
automatically
impose
the
death
penalty,
or
do
we,
on
the
other
hand,
consider
all
the
evidence
and...
and
decide
the
punishment?
but
if
the
jury
had
said,
in...
in
complete
contrast
to
what
in
fact
happened
here,
something
to
the
effect
of,
we've
looked
at
instruction
number
2
repeatedly
and
we
think
we
understand
it.
and
as
we...
as
we...
our
understanding
is
that
if
we
find
one
of
the
aggravating
factors,
that's
it.
that's
the
end
of
our
inquiry.
and
we
just
basically
want
to
make
sure
that's
right.
i
think
clearly
the
judge
would...
would
be
required
to
knock
that
down
and
say,
no,
that's
not
right.
and
then
as
part
of...
of
doing
that,
he'd
have
every
right
to
say
something
along
the
lines
of
go
back
to
instruction
number
2,
beginning
with
the
paragraph
x,
and
that
in
fact
properly
explains
and
sets
forth
the
sentencing
scheme.
but,
i
mean,
if
there
was
some
pretty
conspicuous
or
egregious
misconception
expressed
in
the
jury's
question,
then
that
would
be
something
a
judge
would
have--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--the
word
is
abscond,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
it
would
be
a
closer
question.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
i...
i
disagree
with
the
premise,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--it's...
it's
very
hard
to
answer
that
in
any
kind
of
meaningful
way
without
knowing
the...
the
full
context
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
surely
one
of
the
members
of
the
jury
would
have
had
an
english
teacher
that
would
have--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--i...
i
think
that
the
short
answer
is
i...
if...
if
the
instruction
has
been
upheld
as
adequate,
i
think
the...
the
judge,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
would
be
perfectly
within
his
rights
to
refer
the
jury
back
to
the
instruction
and
the...
and
the
answer...
the
judge
could...
could
reasonably
conclude
that
if
the
jury...
and
you
have
12
members
in
there.
perhaps
you
have
two
alternates
as
well...
that
before
they
return
the
verdict,
that
they
will
come
to
some
acceptable
understanding
of
the
word
abscond.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
that
would...
that's
an
interesting--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--they'll
fill
in
the
briefs,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
and...
and
the
comfort
we
can
take
from
this
case
is
that
we
know
from
buchanan
that
that's
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
no,
justice
souter.
i...
i
think
we
have
obviously
a
continuum
of
questions
and...
and
concerns
they
raise.
what
i'm--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--i
don't
think
that
it
invariably
would
require
it
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
i
think
we
have
to...
i've
given
an
example
where
the
jury
in
this
setting
says
something
that
flatly
evinces
its
misunderstanding
of
its
obligation
to
consider
the
mitigating
evidence.
i
would
agree
if
you--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
that's
clearly--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--that's...
in
this
case
clearly
that
is
the
test,
and
i
think
weeks
fails
miserably.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
and
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
i
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
get
to
that
at
some
point
today.
it
seems
to
me
by
the
logic
of
weeks'
argument...
and
there
can't
be
anything
more
fundamental
in
the
criminal
law
than
the
concept
of
reasonable
doubt
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
seems
to
me
by
weeks--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--and
i'm
saying,
justice
stevens--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
but
we're...
the
fact...
concededly
the
judge
could
have
answered
it
yes
or
no.
but
that
is
not
the
controlling
question
here.
the
question--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--i
don't
know
if
there's
one
any
clearer.
but
the...
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge...
this
is,
after
all,
a
federal
habeas
case
where
we're
considering
in
this
collateral
setting
subject,
among
other
things,
to
the
teague
new
rule
doctrine
in
2254(d)...
whether
or
not
the
judge
was
constitutionally
required
to
give
that
answer
or
whether
or
not
he
was
constitutionally--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--i
don't
think
he
was...
well,
if...
if
you
want
to
refer
to...
to
the
term
ad
lib,
i
do
not
think
he
was
constitutionally
required
by
a
long
shot
to
ad
lib
and
give
that
answer.
he
was...
just
as
importantly,
he
was
not
constitutionally
obligated
or
prohibited--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
no.
i...
justice
souter,
if...
the
example
i
gave
is
where
the
jury
flatly
manifests
some
affirmative
misunderstanding
of
the
law
rather
than
simply
we're
having
a
hard
time
understanding
it.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
something--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
he
certainly
at
a
bare
minimum
constitutionally
would
have
to
say,
no,
that
is
not
right.
you
need...
i
want
to
refer
you
back
to
instruction
number
2,
beginning
with
the
second
paragraph.
that
will
explain...
that
will
tell
you,
in
fact,
how
the
sentencing
process
works
in
virginia.
what
you've
just
said
is
incorrect.
if
he
said
something
along
those
lines,
i
think
that's
perfectly
fine
constitutionally.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
because
i...
i
would
say
that
there...
we're
looking
at
what
the
judge
did
and,
among
other
things,
we're
having
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
even
a
constitutional
matter
to
begin
with.
and
by
the
way--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--because
i...
i
think
it
goes
to
just
how
much
realistically
there
is
a
danger
that
the
jury
will,
in
fact,
misapply
the
instruction.
and
i
might
point
out
that--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--no.
that
is...
well,
it
may
be
as
to--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--two...
two
things,
justice
souter.
first
on
the--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--no.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
the
difference
is,
in
terms
of
applying
the
boyde
test,
we
cannot
just
freeze
in
time
the
question
and
answer,
which
is
what
weeks
wishes
to
do
in
this
case.
everything--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--i
think
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference,
as
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
in
a
later
case,
barrigan-devis,
that...
that
limited
the
mcdowell
case
that
counsel
cited
today.
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
in
terms
of
what
the...
the
judge's
duty
and
obligation
in
responding
to
the
jury's
question
between
a
jury...
a
question
that
simply
says
how
does
it...
how
does
it
work
versus
we
think
we
know
how
it
works
and
then
they
say
something
that
is
wrong.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
under
boyde,
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
jury
has
applied...
that
is
the
phrase...
whether
the
jury...
excuse
me...
whether
a
reasonable
likelihood
exists
that
the
jury
has
applied
the
allegedly
ambiguous
instruction
in
a
constitutionally
impermissible
fashion.
and
boyde
also
talked
in
terms
of...
of
the
common
sense
proposition
about
everything
that
has
taken
place
in
the
trial.
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
just
fix
on
the
question
and
answer
and
say
that
that
is
controlling
above
everything
else,
both
before
and
after.
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
but
for
the
question
that
was
asked...
and
that
is
the
linchpin
of
this
appeal
in
the
first
place...
but
for
that,
we
would
not
know
certain
things
that
are
highly
probative
under
the
boyde
reasonable
probability
test.
we
know,
for
example,
because
the
question
was
asked,
that
there
were
no
follow-up
questions,
even
though
the
jury
in
voir
dire
had
basically
said,
if
we
do
not
fully
understand
an
instruction,
we
promise
to
seek
any
necessary
clarification.
so,
for
2
and
a
half...
they
had
no
follow-up
questions.
we
also
know
that
the
jury
deliberated
for
almost
2
and
a
half
additional
hours.
it
seems
to
me
by
the
logic
of
weeks'
argument,
that
the
deliberations
should
have
essentially
come
to
a
screeching
halt,
that
the
jury,
once
it
heard
this
answer,
they
come
back,
much
like
in
bollenbach,
5
or
10
minutes
later
and
say,
your
honor,
we're
back.
we
sentenced
him
to
death.
if
you'll
just
tell
us
where
we
can
pick
up
our
things
and
we'll
go
home.
nothing
remotely
happened
like
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
very
fact--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--yes,
and...
yes,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
look
at
page
228
of
the
appendix,
that
is
the
one...
and
i
think
this
is
hugely
significant.
that
is
in
fact
the
verdict
form
that
the
jury
found.
there
were
five
verdict
forms
in
this
case,
and
the
verdict
form
seems
to
me
to...
to
make
it
crystal
clear
that
the
jury
considered
and
gave
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence
because
the--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
but
the...
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
question
on
its
face
did
not...
it
did
not
advert
to
either
aggravating
factor...
to...
to
construe
or
equate
the
jury's
question--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
it...
it
seems
to
me,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
would
be
just
rank
speculation
or
conjecture
to
say
that
at
the
time
the
jury
asked
the
question
that
the
jury
had
in
its
mind,
well,
we're
inclined
to
find
vileness
here
and
if
we
find
vileness,
let's
find
out
from
the
judge
whether
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
right.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
could
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
it...
it
might
have
been--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--marginally
clearer,
but
i
think
the
constitutional--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--well,
the
second
half
in
particular.
but
you
take
the
paragraph
as
you
find
it,
as
this
court
did
in
buchanan.
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
well,
the
court
dealt
with
the
overall
instruction
and
said
the
paragraph
itself
created
a
simple
decisional
tree,
which
again
in
the
cert
petition
weeks
affirmatively
tracked
that
language--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--are
we...
are
you
referring,
your
honor,
to
the--
mr.
robert
h.
anderson,
iii
--thank
you,
your
honor.
