justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
instruction
that
gave
rise
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
ever
was
a
circular
argument,
that's
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it
assumes
the...
the
instruction
was
facially
valid,
but
that
this
particular
jury,
just
as
the
dissent
in
the
other
case
predicted,
did
in
fact
misunderstand
it
in
precisely
the
way
the
dissent
predicted
it.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
they
asked
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
question
certainly
would
be
the
question
that
one
reading
the
dissent
would
expect
a
jury
to
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
one
thought
the
dissent
was
right,
which
i
happen
to,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't...
i
didn't
write
it.
but
it
does
raise
the
question
that
a
jury
might
so
interpret
the
instruction,
and
it
appears
from
this
record
the
jury
did
so
interpret
the
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
that's
an
equivalent
of
saying
that
even
though
you
find
the
aggravating
circumstances,
you
may
nevertheless
impose
a
life
sentence?
do
you
think
that
sentence
does
that
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
other
sentence
in...
on
195
conveys
the
message
that
the
jury
sought
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
six
members
of
the
court
thought
that
what
happened
in
this
case
wouldn't
happen
under
this
instruction,
and
they
were
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
happen
in
this
case.
what
they...
what
was
predicted
in
the
dissent
happened
in
this
very
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there's
a...
there's
a
vast
difference
between
a
general
misunderstanding
of
a
term
like
that
and
a
question
that
was
asked
in
this
case.
if
we
believe
that
lonnie
weeks,
jr.
is
guilty
of
at
least
one
of
the
alternatives,
then
is
it
our
duty
to...
as
a
jury
to
issue
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
yes
or
no
question
that
doesn't
require
any
ad
libbing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he...
is
there
any
possible
answer
that
would
have
been
clearer
than
either
a
yes
or
a
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
constitutionally
required
to
ad
lib
either
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
perfectly
satisfactory
to
refer
the
jury
back
to
the
very
question
in...
very
sentence
in
the
instructions
that
gave
rise
to
the
question.
that's
a...
that's
an
adequate
answer
in
your
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
just
one
last...
one
question
before
you
light
goes
off?
would
you
agree
that
if
the
judge
had
responded,
instead
of
saying
see
second
paragraph,
instruction
2,
which
begins
if
you
find,
if
instead
he
had
responded
with
the
reference
to
the
second
clause,
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence,
that
the
answer
would
have
been
clearer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
when
he...
when
the
judge
responded
to
the
question,
he
referred
the
jury
to
the
entire
paragraph,
beginning
if
you
find
from
the
evidence.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
response
would
have
been
clearer
if
he
had
said...
referred
them
to
the
second
clause
in
the
paragraph,
or
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence,
that
that
would
have
been
more
directly
responsive
to
the
jurors'
question.
do
you
think
that's
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
have
been.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is...
it
is
the
second
half
on
which
you
rely
as
the
clarity
of
the
answer,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
first
part
of
the
paragraph
is
not
responsive
to
the
question,
and
the
second
half
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
he
used
the
same
words--
