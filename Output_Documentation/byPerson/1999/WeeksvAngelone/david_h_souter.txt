no,
but
they
didn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
they
didn't
say
that.
my...
i
guess
i
want
to
be
clear
on
one
thing.
do
you
think
there
is
anything
either
erroneous
or
at
least
in
an
objective
sense
incomprehensible
about
the
instruction
to
which
he
referred
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
ambiguous
about
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
page
are
we
on?
let's
hear
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
olive,
what...
what
do
you
make
of...
of
this
portion
of
the...
the
facts
here?
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
we
have
a
jury
that
is
not
too
bashful
to
ask
a
question.
number
two,
the
judge
refers
them
to
an
instruction
which...
which
we
must
take
as
a
proper
instruction.
and
in
fact,
i...
i
do
take
it.
number
three,
having
been
referred
back
to
that
instruction
which
the
jury
has
in
front
of
it,
the
jury
then
spends
approximately
2
hours
before
it
returns
a
verdict.
it
doesn't
come
back
with
a
snap
verdict
5
minutes
later
saying
death
penalty,
nor
in
that
2-hour
period
of
time
does
it
come
back
with
a
further
question.
if
we
are
going
to
engage
in
psychologizing
here
to
try
to
find...
try
to
assess
the
risk,
isn't
the
most
probable
inference
the
following
one?
that
in
fact
this
jury,
which
knew
how
to
ask
questions,
didn't
have
a
further
question
to
ask,
and
number
two,
spent
their
2
hours
in
considering
the
very
discretion
which,
according
to
the
instruction,
they
had?
and
if
we
draw
those
inferences,
i
don't
see
where
there
is
an
intolerable
risk
or
even
a
substantial
risk
that
the
jury
misunderstood
these
instructions.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is...
i...
i
don't
see
how
that
can
possibly
get
us
beyond
pure
speculation.
maybe
what
you
suggest
is
true,
but
it
seems
to
me
far
more
likely
they
are
in
tears
because
they
have...
they
have
had
as
jurors
to
perform
the...
the
most
terrible
act
that
a
juror
can
ever
have
to
do,
and
that
is
to
recommend
a
death
sentence
for
someone.
and...
and
for
me
to
say
or
for
this
court
to
say,
well,
the...
the
emotional
reaction
is,
in
effect,
a...
a
basis
for
inferring
incapacity
to
understand
instructions,
rather
than
to
say
their
emotional
response
was
a
response
to
the
terrible
burden
that
they
have
just
discharged,
would
be
pure
speculation.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your...
the...
the
burden
of
your
argument
is
to...
is
to
indicate
to
us
that
there
is
the
risk
that
you
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
don't
see
anything
more
than
a
speculative
basis
for
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i,
however,
go
back
to
my
question,
which
has
sort
of
dropped
out
of
our
dialogue
here?
if...
if
we...
perhaps
we
should
agree
to
disagree
on
the
significance
of
the
jury's
emotional
reaction.
and
let's
go
back
to
my
question.
non-bashful
jury,
question,
referral
to
an
instruction
which
is
sound,
2
hours
of
further
deliberation
before
the
jury
comes
back,
no
further
question.
isn't
the
most
reasonable
inference,
if
we're
going
to
draw
one
at
all,
that
this
jury
that
knew
how
to
ask
questions
didn't
have
a
further
question
and
spent
the
2
hours,
in
effect,
deliberating
over
the
discretion
that
they
understood
themselves
to
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
but
it
wasn't
just
follow
the
instructions.
the...
the
response
was
go
to
a
certain
paragraph
of
instruction
number
2
i
think
it
was...
whatever...
which
was
the
instruction
that
was
right
on
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sometimes--
justice
david
h.
souter
--sometimes
in
reading
briefs,
i
find
that
reading
a
paragraph
a
second
time
helps
me,
and
i
understand
it
the
second
time
when
i
didn't
the
first
time.
and
the
premise
of
the
judge's
response
is
that
something
like
that
may
happen
with
jurors
in
jury
instructions,
and
it
seems
to
me
a
pretty
sound
assumption
to
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
olive,
you
may
have
adverted
to
this
earlier
and
i
may
not
have
been
paying
attention
when
you
did.
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
the
judge
in
this
case
had
followed
his
reference
back
to
the
instruction
by
saying
the
following
thing,
would
you
still
have
an
argument
here?
what
if
the
judge
had
said,
if
after
you
have
reread
the
paragraph
i've
referred
you
to,
you
still
have
a
question
about
the
way
it
should
be
applied,
come
back
and
we'll
go
further?
if
the
judge
had
said
that,
would
you
have
any
case
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
basically...
if
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
you
basically
reject
the
proposition
that
it's
the
obligation
of
the
judge
to
explain
the
law
to
the
jury
in
a
way
that
the
jury
can
understand.
you...
you
reject
that
proposition
because
you
say
even
if
it
affirmatively
appears
that
the
judge
has
not
done
that,
we'll
leave
it
to
the
other
jurors
to...
to
help
their...
their
lagging
friends
to
figure
out
what
it
means.
so,
you
basically
reject
the...
the
proposition
that
the
judge
has
the
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
let's
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
you...
you
say,
as
i
understand
it,
that
when
the
jury
makes
it
clear
beyond
peradventure
that
some
of
its
members
do
not
understand
a
word
which
is
crucial
to
the
instruction,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
judge
has
got
to
explain
that
to
the...
to
the
jurors
who
are
having
the
difficulty.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how...
what
are
the
circumstances
in
which
we
decide
we'll
play
roulette
and...
and
take
a
chance
that
a
juror
will
return
a
verdict
using
a
term
that
the
juror
does
not
understand?
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
in
which
you
indicated
the...
that
the...
that
your
answer
might
be
different,
the
result
might
be
different,
if
the
jurors
had
come
back
and...
and
had,
to
a
degree
not
present
here,
made
it
affirmatively
clear
that
they
just
were
not
able
to
follow
the...
the
instruction.
if
they
had
said,
look,
we...
we
just
don't
understand
what
you're
trying
to
get
at
by
this
instruction,
that
there
the
judge
might
have
had
a
further
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
let's
say
the
jury
comes
back
and
say,
we...
we
understand
that
once
we
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
we've
got
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
period.
right?
have
we
got
it
right?
in
that
circumstance...
i
think
that
was
your
hypo
before
or
something
like
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
that...
in
that
circumstance,
you
would
say,
well,
yes,
the
judge
has
got
to
explain
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
difference
in
principle
between
a
jury
coming
back
and
indicating
precisely
the...
the
erroneous
conclusion
they're
drawing
from
the
instruction
on
the
one
hand
and
the
juror
coming
back
saying,
in
effect,
we
don't
know
what
to
infer
from
the
instruction.
we
don't
know
whether
the
answer
to
our
question
is
yes
or
whether
the
answer
to
our
question
is
no.
why
should
there
be
a
distinction
in
principle
between
those
two
situations?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
stick
to
my
question
for
a
minute.
why
should
there
be
a
distinction
in
principle
between
the
jurors
who
manifest...
and...
and
affirmatively
manifest
an
erroneous
reading
of
the
instruction
and
the
situation
in
which
the
jurors
clearly
manifest
that
they
don't
understand
the
instruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
in
the
first
place
the...
the
odds
are
up
at
about
99
percent
that
they're
going
to
misapply
it,
and
in
the
second
case,
we
don't
have
a
clue
what
they're
going
to
do.
we
can't
tell
you
what
the
odds
are.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
difference
between
the
two
situations?
if
the
jurors
say,
we
don't
know
what
the
thing
means.
you
know,
they
might
jump
this
way.
they
might
jump
that
way.
we
don't
know.
so...
so,
we
can't
give
you
any
odds
in
the
second
situation.
in
the
first
situation,
we
know
darned
well
what
they're
going
to
do
if
the
judge
doesn't
head
them
off.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that's
the
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
just
yes
or
no.
isn't
that
the
difference
between
the
two
situations?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're...
you're
not
answering
my
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i...
i
think
he
should
answer
my
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
under
boyde,
why
should
that
be
so?
