mr.
mark
e.
olive
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
an
intolerable
risk
in
this
case
that
the
jurors
erroneously
and
mistakenly
believed
that
in
sentencing
the
petitioner,
they
had
a
duty
to
sentence
him
to
death
upon
the
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
this
violates
the
eighth
amendment
and
the
petitioner
seeks
resentencing.
five
facts
compel
this
conclusion.
first,
the
jurors
promised
to
do
two
things:
one,
sentence
according
to
the
instructions;
and
two,
come
back
and
ask
the
court
what
the
instructions
meant
if
they
didn't
understand
them.
number
two,
the
actual
sentencing
instructions
were
quite
short.
the
pertinent
instructions
are
at
pages
199
and
200
of
the
ja
and
are
two-pages
long.
number
three,
the
jurors
had
these
short
instructions
read
to
them
in
court.
they
heard
these
short
instructions.
number
four,
the
jurors
then
took
these
short
instructions
with
them
into
the
jury
room.
they
had
them
in
the
jury
room.
if
there
was
any
confusion
or
lack
of
memory
about
what
the
instructions
said,
they
had
them
there
to
study.
and
number
five,
they
clearly
did
study
these
jury
instructions.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
instruction
in
the
context
of
buchanan
was
upheld.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
read
buchanan,
there
is
a
footnote
4
in
which
you
write
that
the
instruction
which
would
be
unconstitutional
would
be
a
strained...
s-t-r-a-i-n-e-d...
strained
construction
of
the
statute.
and
then
after
that
footnote,
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
were
we
concerned...
and
that's
where
the
boyde
citation
is...
and
the
court
says,
quote,
in
this
context,
in
the
context
of
all
the
things
that
had
happened
at
trial...
in
this
context
under
boyde
is
satisfied.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
my
reading
of
the
case
is...
is
the
same
as
your
reading
of
the
case,
that
there
was
an
application
of
boyde.
but
also
the
fourth
footnote
says
to
me
that
if
a
juror
had
this
understanding,
the
strained
understanding,
of
the
instruction,
the
court
would
unanimously
condemn
it.
and
our
argument
is
that
these
jurors
had...
or
there's
a
risk...
had
this
strained
misunderstanding
of
the...
of
the
instruction.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
rule
in
this
case
we
feel
is
compelled...
we're
not
seeking
a
rule.
we
think
it's
compelled
by
eddings,
and
yes,
the
rule
that
we're
asking
for
is
a
capital
case
rule.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
not
at
all.
the
rule--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well,
here
you
have
a
question
which
illustrates
that
the
jurors
are
poised
to
violate
lockett
and
eddings.
we
have
parsed
this
instruction.
we
have
thought
about
it,
and
we
have
thought
about
it
enough
to...
to
write
out
a
question
and
to
highlight
what
we
think
our
options
are.
that's
far
different
from,
you
know,
what's...
what
are
we
doing
here?
mr.
mark
e.
olive
it...
it
occurs
not
infrequently,
primarily
in
non-capital
cases,
and
it
may,
in
fact,
occur
in
some
capital
cases.
the
amicus
brief,
which
says
the
cases
that
are
illustrative
there
are
no...
none
of
them
are
capital
cases.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
that
once
the
jury
or
the
sentencer
comes
out
and
illustrates
what
they're
thinking,
then
the
surrounding
circumstances,
which
are
so
important
in
a
boyde
context
when
you're
trying
to
figure
out
what
they
might
have
been
thinking,
carries
less
weight.
i
think
the
overall
content--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--and...
and
the
sentencing
judge
in
eddings
had
a
statute...
and
we
presume
he
understood
it...
that
said
any
circumstances
can
be
admitted
and
any
circumstances
could
be
considered.
but
the
risk
in
eddings
was
that
judge's
comment...
offhanded
some
would
argue,
or
controlling
others
would
argue...
that
he
believed
he
couldn't
or
might
not
be
able
to
consider
certain
mitigating
circumstances.
and
that
was
in
the
context
of
not
argument,
but
a
record
full
of
mitigating
circumstances
on
a
statute
that
he
was
presumed
to
understand.
and
your
honor
wrote
in
concurrence
that
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
that
that
judge
was
just
making
an
offhanded
comment.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
here...
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
it's
the
only
paragraph
in
the...
the
instructions
that
would
have
created
the
question.
there's
no
other
operative
paragraph
in
the
instructions.
and
i
would
bet...
i
want
to
focus
not
on...
on
lawyers
or
judges
or
justices,
but
on
jurors.
and
this
quote's
recognition
many
times...
once
in
simmons
at
512
u.s.
171
that
we
presume
jurors
are
going
to
follow
the
instructions
even
if
pointed
back
to
them.
and
now
i'll
quote.
because
the
consequences
of
failure
are
so
vital
to
the
defendant,
the
practical
and
human
limitations
of
the
jury
system
cannot
be
ignored.
and
the
practical
and
human
limitations
of
the
jury
system
here
was
i
bet
the
jurors
had
memorized
that
instruction
when
it
finally
got
back
to--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
a
contract
is
a
great
example.
it's
like
a
rico
instruction.
it's...
it's
plausible,
even
probable
that
a
juror
or
a
client
would
say,
i
don't
get
it.
that's
because
it's
in
paragraph
44(a)(2)(b).
here,
there
was
one
instruction--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that
is--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the...
the
fact
that
the
jurors
came
back
two
or
three
times,
which
justice
scalia
referred
to,
to
me
cuts
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
say
he
did
it
in
this
case
and
in
the
context
of
this
case.
they
came
back
three
times,
and
every
time
they
came
back,
they
didn't
get
an
answer.
they
got
an
answer
which
was
no
more
helpful
than
what
had
already
been
given.
the
answer
was
follow
my
instructions.
the
answer
that
you
just
gave
was
follow
this
particular
instruction,
and
the
juror...
a
reasonable
juror,
a
practical
juror
would
say,
you
know,
i've
got
that
memorized.
that's
why
i'm
here.
i
came
out--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i
came
out
of
the
jury
room.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
incomprehensible?
no.
ambiguous?
yes.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
the
ambiguity
would
be
the
ambiguity
recognized
by
the
dissenters
in
buchanan,
is
that
if
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
what
you
must
do
is
impose
the
death
penalty
or...
and
then
the
rest
of
the
phrase...
to
where
if
you...
if
you
haven't
found
an
aggravating
circumstance,
then
you
shall
not--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--which...
which
didn't--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--with
the--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--with
the
ambiguity
being
parenthetically,
i.e.,
that
there
is
no
aggravating
circumstance
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
can
only
speculate.
i
do
not
know
the
historical
background
of
that
change.
so,
it
would
be
speculation.
but
my
speculation,
which
would
be
informed,
would
be
this
court's
opinion
that
there
was
a
problem
where
there
was
a...
a
discussion
of
a
problem
and
a
split
in
the
court
about
whether
these
were
clear
or
not
clear.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
yes.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
correct.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
which
is
a--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that...
after
the
word
justified
come
in
the
parenthetical.
what
do
you
mean
by
not
justified?
that
there's
no
aggravating
circumstance
found.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
what
the--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--no,
i
am
not--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i'm
not
asking
that.
i'm...
i
look
at
buchanan
actually
as
authority
for
the
proposition
in
this
case
because
of
the
footnote
which
says,
well,
yes,
a
jury
could
read
this
way.
they'd
just
be
wrong.
and
if
this
court
had
had
a
jury
reading
this
instruction
this
way
in
buchanan,
i
doubt
that
we
would
have
buchanan
written
the
way
it
is.
buchanan
didn't
announce
a
rule
that
forever
and
ever
jurists
and
sentencers
won't
make
a
mistake
or
won't
do
a
strained--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that...
i
think
that
that's...
and
what
we're
arguing
is
that
an
application
in
particular
cases,
it
would
nevertheless
not
be
constitutional.
the
court
and
jury--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--under
some
circumstances,
it
is
not
extraordinary.
in
fact,
when
jurors
don't
even
ask
a
question.
penry,
for
example,
perfectly
constitutional
sentencing
instructions,
but
the
circumstances
of
that
case
compelled
an
additional
instruction.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
and
skipper
is
another
example.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
that
the...
the
cases
holding
that
either
implicitly
or
expressly
are
penry
and--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--and
simmons.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
no.
it
was
even
less
than
that.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
do
not.
however,
with
respect
to
both
penry
and
simmons,
the
issue
was
what
would
a
juror
think,
and
if
it
was
possible
and
reasonably
likely
that
a
juror
would
think
something,
then
this
court
found
that
constitutionally
adequate
previously
juror
instructions
were
not
sufficient
in
that
case.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
and
additional...
additional
instructions
had
to
be
given.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
buchanan?
mr.
mark
e.
olive
in
buchanan.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
no.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
but
you
can
have
a--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the
clear
factor
about
it
that
makes
this
special
is
that
these
sentencers
were
like
the
sentencer
in
eddings.
there
is
an
intolerable
risk
that
these
sentencers
believe
they
were
precluded.
now,
in
eddings,
we
had
a
judge
who
we
presume
knew
the
statute
and
had
an
offhanded
remark--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--but
the
court
in
buchanan
stated
that
an
interpretation
like
this
would
be
a
strained
interpretation.
when
you
have
before
you
a
sentencer
who
has
a
strained
interpretation,
as
in
eddings,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--to
correct
that
strained
interpretation.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
no,
there
isn't,
but
when
a
court--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--it
alerts
the
court
that
the
jury
or
sentencer
is
poised
to
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
if
they
come
back.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
you
know,
it's...
it
is
only
in
the
cases
where
the
jury
comes
back
and
asks
the
question
that
i
think
that
you
can
feel
comfortable,
especially
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
they
highlight
and
underline
and
tell
you
what
they've
been
thinking,
that
they
have
interpreted
the
sentencing
instruction
in
a
way
that
could
violate
lockett.
we
have
lots
of
judges...
now,
i'm
sure
this
won't
be
a
popular
notion...
who
may
not
act
according
to
a
statute
or
many
not
act
according
to
sentencing
instructions
because
they
make
a
mistake.
that
may
happen
all
the
time.
but
when
the
judge
indicates
that
a
mistake...
especially
a
capital
sentencing
judge
indicates
that
a
mistake
may
have
been
made,
this
court
does
not
tolerate
the
risk.
and
that's
the
eddings
principle.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
there's
something
in
this
record
that
i've
never
seen
before.
the
jurors
come
back
with
their
verdict.
and
the
juror
then...
the
jurors
then
are
polled,
one
by
one.
and
the
first
juror's
name
is
called
and
the...
the
question
is,
is
this
your
verdict,
the
death
penalty?
and
the
court
reporter
sua
sponte,
without
any
request
from
anyone,
puts
in
a
parenthetical,
whereupon
a
majority
of
the
jurors
were
in
tears.
now,
they
were
gone
for
2
hours.
are
they
in
tears
because
they
think
they
have
a
duty
they
don't
want
to
carry
out?
mr.
mark
e.
olive
and
the
other
position
would
be
pure
speculation.
and
our
obligation
is
to
remove
speculation.
let
me
go
to
the
second
part--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--correct.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
referring
the--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--no.
i
think
the
jury
came
back
three
times.
they
were
promised
during
voir
dire
if
you
come
back,
you'll
get
further
instruction
that
will
help
you,
and
three
times
they
came
back.
the
further
instruction
was
not
additional
instruction,
not
a
clarifying
instruction;
it
was
follow
the
instructions.
so,
your
argument--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the
instruction...
the
instruction
gave
rise
to
the
question.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
and
the...
the
question
supposes
that
repetition
equals
clarity
for
these
jurors--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--and
that's...
that's
an
inference
that
we
can't
draw
as
well
because
i
think
that--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that's
why
i've
tried
to
set
the
table
with
these
jurors
did
that.
they
read
the...
the
paragraph
a
second
time,
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
conclude,
they
read
it
over
and
over.
these
jurors
came
back
with
a
very
detailed
question,
illustrating
they
had
read
the
paragraph
or
the
instruction
again
and
again.
they
had
a
simple
yes
or
no
question
they
had
crafted,
illustrating
to
the
court
what
they
thought
the
problems
were
with
the
case
and
what
their
confusion
was.
they
had
highlighted
it.
i
can't
for
a
moment
think
these
jurors
hadn't
read
and
reread,
been
confused,
read
it
again,
and
formulated
the
question.
under
those
circumstances,
i
don't
think
it
does
any
good
whatsoever
to
send
the
jurors
back.
my
response
as
a
juror
would
be
i've
practically
memorized
this
instruction.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well
put.
[laughter]
mr.
mark
e.
olive
there
have
been
arguments
made
that
2254(d)
applies.
the
arguments
back
and
forth.
i'll
go
into
them
if...
if
your
honor
would
like
me
to,
but
i
guess
the
simple
answer
is--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that
the
standard
of
review
under
2254(d)
ought
not
to
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
and
the
reason
that
it
ought
not
to
apply
in
this
case
is
because
2254
and...
and
all
of
a-e-d-p-a,
or
aedpa,
has
as
it's
policy
concern
or...
or
recognition
that
state
courts
that
grapple
with
federal
constitutional
issues
ought
to
be
rewarded
or
certainly
not
punished
for
their
good
faith
efforts
to
enforce
the
federal
constitution
by
looking
at
the
legal
landscape
and
applying
the
law.
and
when
you
have
a
decision
from
a
state
court
which
doesn't
reflect
that
struggle,
which
is
simply
a
summary
denial,
then
you
don't
have
an
adjudication
or
an
opinion
to
which
deference
ought...
ought
to
apply.
now,
that
issue
has
not
been
thoroughly
briefed
or
addressed
by
the
parties,
but
that
would
be
my
argument
with
respect
to
2254(d).
mr.
mark
e.
olive
it
said
just
denied
and
that's
what
i
mean
by
summary--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--on
these...
on
these
claims,
the
state
court
simply
said
we
find
no
merit
and
denied
and
didn't
state
the
legal
basis
for
it
and
didn't
give
us
what
the
legal
landscape
was.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
it
said
that
these
so-called
arguments
we
reject,
and
in
the
brief
the
so-called
arguments
were
our
reference
to
penry
and
to
woodson
and
to
brown.
so,
yes,
it
did
say
that,
but
the
court
in
its
opinion
didn't
indicate
on
what
basis
it
was
rejecting
the
claims.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
yes.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
correct.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
correct.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
our--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--our
argument
is
that
penry
recognized
that
the
eddings
rule
applied
to
juries
as
of
1986.
our
position
is
that
the
eddings
rule
is
that
if
there
a
risk
that
the
sentencer
considers
themselves
precluded,
then
the
state
has
to
correct
that
misimpression.
so,
penry
would
be
our
argument
that
eddings
was
the
law,
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
opinion
is
contrary
to
or
that
they
applied
in
an
unreasonable
manner.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
believe
i
would.
again,
i
got
two...
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
one,
they
might
not
believe
that,
having
been
promised
that
throughout
voir
dire
and
three
times
it
not
happening.
but
number
two,
the
mcdowell
case,
which
we
put
in
the...
in
the
petition
and
is
also
in...
in
the
blue
brief...
that's
a
case
in
which
the
jury
came
back,
asked
a
question,
the
judge
answered
it,
and
the
judge
said
to
the
jurors,
now
does
that
answer
your
question?
and
all
the
jurors...
or
at
least
one
of
the
jurors
on
behalf
of
the
jurors
said,
yes,
that
answers
our
question.
and
in
mcdowell,
the
court
said
by
referring
them
back
to
the
same
instruction,
it
would
be
folly
to
presume
that
that
instruction
really
helped
them
out
of
their
dilemma.
so,
i
think
we
would
still
have
the
same
problem.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
correct.
it's
judge...
judge
trott.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
right.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
penry
i
think
involves
a
boyde
analysis
as
well,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
but
our
position
is
that
once
the
juror...
once
we
know
what
the
jurors
are
thinking,
once
they
have
given
us
an
eddings
statement,
boyde
may
no
longer
be
the
test.
the
test
may
instead
be
a
test
that
has
a
different
risk
assessment,
which
is
an
eddings
test,
whether
there's
a...
a
risk
as
opposed
to
a
reasonable
likelihood.
and
if
there's
a
difference
between
those
tests
that's
more
petitioner-friendly,
i
would
assume
the
eddings
test
would
be
the
test
that
applied.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
in...
in
eddings,
this
court
didn't
remand
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
and
say
read
the
statute,
just
read
the
statute.
this
court
said,
you've
got
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances.
