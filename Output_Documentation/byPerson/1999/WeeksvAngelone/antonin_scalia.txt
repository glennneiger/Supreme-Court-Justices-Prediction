mr.
olive,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
argue
as
though
the...
the
judge
did
not
give
the
jury
any
help
at
all
when
they
asked
this
question,
but
that's
not
the
case.
he
just
didn't...
he
just
didn't
snap
back,
well,
you
know,
the
question
is
already
answered
in
the
instructions.
he
specifically
referred
them
to
the...
to
the
paragraph
of
the
instructions
that
answered
the
question.
i
think
that's...
that's
a
considerable
help.
and
then
you
add
to
that
the
fact
that...
that
the
jury,
which
had
already
asked
two
questions
and
therefore
was
not
shy
about
asking
when
it
didn't
understand
the
instructions,
did
not
come
back
and...
and
say,
we
still
don't
understand.
i
don't
know
why
you
think
there's
a
serious
risk
that
they...
that
they
still
didn't
misconstrue
it.
in
fact,
you
know,
you
might
argue
there's
a...
a
greater
risk
of
misconstruction
when
you're...
when
you're
dealing
with
a
jury
that
has
displayed
it's...
it's
reluctant
to
ask
questions.
here's
a
jury
that
asked
the
question.
the
judge
said,
this
is
the
paragraph
that
answers
your
question,
and...
and
you
heard
nothing
more
from
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
was
that
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
ambiguous?
what
is...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
frankly
find
it
hard
to
see
how
you
could
have
said
it
more
clearly
if
he
had
tried
to
reformulate
it
in
some
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says,
or
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you
shall
fix
the
punishment
of
the
defendant
at
life
imprisonment.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
the
statute
is,
as
you
say,
ambiguous,
why
would
you
think
that
some
other
jury
that
didn't
ask
a
question
was
simply
wrong
in
picking
the
wrong...
the
wrong
choice
of
the
ambiguity?
i...
i
don't
know
why
the
asking
of
the
question,
if
it's
really
ambiguous,
there's...
there's
an
enormous
risk
that
a
jury
that
doesn't
ask
a
question
would
have
interpreted
it
the
wrong
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
some
principle
that
a
person
who
is
taking
a
strained
interpretation
will
normally
ask
a
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
seems
to
me
that's
essential
to
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's...
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
fact
that
they...
that
they
asked
a
question
makes
no
difference.
and
if...
and
we
should
simply
say
in
all
cases
there's
a
risk
that
a
jury
is...
is
going
to
come
back
with
the
wrong...
with
the
wrong
answer
to
this.
and...
and
we
said,
you
know,
that
that's
not
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--alert
the
court
unless
you...
unless
you
somehow
sustain
the
principle
that
a
person
who
is
likely
to
take
a
strained
interpretation
is
also
likely
to
ask
a
question.
and
i
don't
know
why
that
follows.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
if
we
adopted
your
position,
states
would
have
to
have
two
form
instructions
because
if
you
say
just
repeating
the
form
instruction
is
not
enough,
you'd
either
leave
it
to
the
judge
to
do
a
seat-of-the-pants
reformulation
of
the...
of
the
standard
state
instruction
or
you...
you
would
have
to
have
a
second...
a
second
alternative
prescribed
as
a
form
instruction.
indeed,
maybe
a
third
because
if
they
don't
understand
the
second
and
they
come
back
and
ask
the
question
again,
you're
going
to
need
a
third
one.
or
else
you
let
each
judge
seat-of-the-pants
it
every
time
they...
every
time
they
say,
i
don't
really
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--every
instruction
that
a
jury
asks
a
question
about
has
to
be
a
flawed
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe...
maybe
an
instruction
would
be
invalid
if
it
used
a
term
so
technical
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
nobody
on
the
jury
would
know
what
it
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that's
why
you
have
12
jurors,
so
that
even
if...
if
some
have
had
bad
english
teachers,
the
rest
would
be
able
to
help
them
out
as
to
what
fairly
standard
words
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
use
a
word
so
hypertechnical,
maybe
the
instruction
would
be
bad
if...
if
indeed
it's
likely
nobody
on
the
jury
would
know
what
it
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
i...
i
don't
know
why
you're
not
willing
to
grasp
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
say
that
there
is...
once...
once
an
instruction
has
been
found
clear,
there
is
no
obligation
to
clarify
it
any
further.
indeed,
i
would
think
that
the
term
that
a
jury
most
often
doesn't
understand
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
i
bet
they
come
in
with
questions
about
that
all
the
time.
and
as
you
know,
that
is
a
mine
field
and
any
judge
would
be
out
of
his
mind
if
he
did
anything
except
read
back
the
state
formulary
instruction
as
to
what
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
means,
rather
than
ad
lib
a
response
to
that
difficult
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
him
explain.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
said
the
second
clause,
i'm
not
sure
that
the...
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
fictional
high
school
teacher
taught
them
what
a
clause
is
either.
i'm
not
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
would
have
been...
i
would
have
been--
