chief

william

rehnquist
the
instruction
you're
talking
about
was
upheld
in
buchanan,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
upheld
across
the
board
i
think.
it
didn't
say
in
the
context
of
buchanan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the...
the
qualification
is
were
we
to
entertain
any
doubt,
which
is
a
subjunctive.
it
didn't
say
we
did
entertain
doubt.
it's
an
alternative
ground.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
broad
a
rule
are...
are
you
asking
for
here?
is
it
limited
to
capital
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
it
that
whenever
the
jury
asks...
sends
a
note
to
the
judge
asking
a
question
that
the
judge
can't
refer
them
to
an
instruction;
he
has
to
respond
directly
to
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how...
how
do
you
differ
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--no,
but
it
did
announce...
it
did
announce
that
this
instruction
was
sufficiently
clear
to
be
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're...
you're
saying
then
that
even
though
an
instruction
is
perfectly
sound,
the
constitution
requires
that
if
a
jury...
juror
asks
a
question,
the
trial
judge
has
to
do
something
more
than
simply
refer
them
to
the
instruction.
that's
an
extraordinary
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do...
do--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
have
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
will
require
a
judge
to
answer
a
juror's
question
by
something
other
than
a
referral
back
to
an
instruction?
is
there
any
case
where
we
have
held
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that...
was
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
that
a
jury
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i'm
asking
you
do
you
have
a
case
from
this
court
in
which
the
court
held
it
was
constitutionally
required
when
a...
a
good
instruction
was
given,
but
a
juror
asked
a
question,
that
the
judge
could
not
simply
refer
them
to
the
instruction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
surprised
you
call
it
a
summary
denial
because
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
wrote
an
opinion
dealing
with
all
sorts
of
issues
at
some
length,
and
they
said
this
issue
simply
was...
was
barely
averted
to
and
no
supporting
authority.
so,
they
said
we
will...
you
know,
we'll
rule
against
you
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
it
said
that
the...
that
the
claims
were
simply
stated
and
not
argued,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olive.
mr.
anderson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
99-5746,
weeks
against
angelone.
virginia
jury
found
the
petitioner
lonnie
weeks
jr.,
guilty
of
the
murder
of
virginia
state
trooper.
at
sentencing
the
prosecution
sought
to
prove
too
aggravating
circumstances,
and
petitioner
presented
10
witnesses
in
mitigation.
while
the
jurors
were
deliberating,
they
sent
the
trial
judge
a
note,
the
jurors
note
asked,
whether
assuming
that
they
had
found
that
the
prosecution
proved
in
aggravating
circumstance,
they
were
required
to
give
the
death
penalty
or
could
choose
between
a
life
sentence
and
the
death
penalty.
the
judge
responded
by
directing
the
jurors
to
the
precise
paragraph
of
the
jury
instruction
that
dealt
with
their
question,
and
we
have
previously
held
in
our
buchanan
opinion
that
this
jury
instruction
satisfies
the
constitution.
two
hours
later
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
finding
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
sentencing
the
petitioner
to
death.
the
virginia
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction
in
sentence.
a
federal
habeas
district
court
denied
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
the
denial
of
habeas
relief.
petitioner
argues
that
the
manner
in
which
the
trial
judge
answered
the
jurorâ€™s
question
did
not
resolve
their
confusion.
thus
he
contends
there
exists
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jurors
felt
they
were
not
free
to
consider
mitigating
evidence
in
violation
of
our
cases.
for
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
petitioner
is
not
demonstrated
that
such
a
reasonable
likelihood
exists.
accordingly,
we
conclude
that
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
habeas
relief
under
section
2254(d)
and
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
and
breyer
joined
and
in
which
justice
souter
joins
in
part.
