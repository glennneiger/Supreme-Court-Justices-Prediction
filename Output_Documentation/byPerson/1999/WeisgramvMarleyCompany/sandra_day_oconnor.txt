but...
but
do
you
say
that
it
has
to
be
automatically
remanded
to
the
trial
court
and
then
the
trial
court
still
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
grant
a
new
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position,
i
gather,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial
or
even
discretion
to
send
it
back
and
let
the
trial
court
decide
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
means,
i
guess,
that
under
some
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
might
abuse
its
discretion
when
it
didn't
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
if
the...
they
had
three
expert
witnesses
lined
up
ready
to
go,
and
the
trial
court
said,
that's
cumulative.
you
use
one.
we're
not
going
to
hear
the
rest.
so,
they
put
the
one
in.
then
they
go
on
appeal
and
the
appellate
court
says,
gee,
that
one
wasn't
qualified.
you
shouldn't
have
heard
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
that...
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
there
not
to
send
it
back
and--
