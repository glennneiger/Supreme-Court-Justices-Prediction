justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
at
that
point?
wasn't
there
an
objection
by
the
defendant
to
that
expert
testimony
that
could
have
tipped
you
off
that
they
would
bring
that
up
on
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's...
that
was
going
to
be...
it
seemed
to
me,
sitting
where
you
were
at
the
trial,
you
would
know
that
if
there
was
a
jury
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
and
the
trial
court
entered
judgment
on
that
verdict,
that
the
defendant
would
appeal
on
the
ground
that
that
expert
testimony
was
inadmissible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i...
i
wasn't
suggesting
that...
that
you
are
somehow
foreclosed
because
you
didn't
make
that
conditional
motion.
i
was
just
suggesting
to
you
that
you
knew
that
this
was
a
ground
of
appeal
and
that
you
could
have
asked.
you
could
have
said
to
the
district
judge,
we
think
that
that
evidence
was
all
proper,
but
just
in
case,
could
you
say
in
the
alternative
a
new
trial.
or
you
could
have
argued...
when
you
argued
your
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
when
you
knew
what
their
position
would
be,
when
you
knew
the
defendant's
position,
you
could
have
said,
court
of
appeals,
we
think
that...
that
expert
testimony
was
properly
admitted,
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that,
at
least
we
should
get
a
new
trial
and
not
an
instruction
to
enter
judgment
for
the
defendant.
you
could
have
made
that
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
that's...
that
is
the
awkward
thing
about
rule...
rule
50,
that
it
puts
the
judge...
also
the
judge
into
the
position
of
saying,
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
what
would
i
rule.
but
it
is
an
option
that
you
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
it's
only
when
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
get
to
the
jury,
not
when
the
evidence
would
be
sufficient
if
you
had
these
experts.
but
i
don't
understand
that
argument,
frankly,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
is
that
testimony
should
never
have
been
before
the
jury.
so,
when
we
assess
whether
there
should
be
a
new
trial
or
the
entry
of
judgment
for
defendant,
it's
just
as
though
that
evidence
never
existed.
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
you're
making
between
an
insufficient
record
in
a
trial
court
and
a
record
made
insufficient
because
three
witnesses
who
were
credited
by
the
jury
shouldn't
have
testified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
what
they
were
making
was
the
same
legal
question
that
you
would
get
at
summary
judgment.
at...
and
when
make
the
judgment
before
the
verdict,
when
you
make
it
after,
it's
always
was
there
enough
produced
to
warrant
a
decision
in
that
party's
favor.
and
the...
the
legal
question
doesn't
change
as
you
move
from
summary
judgment
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
before
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
renewed
motion
after.
it's
always
the
same
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
anything
in
montgomery
ward
that
says
you're
supposed
to
take
into
account
improperly
admitted
evidence.
i
think
that
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
does
not
reflect
your
position
because
you
insist
that
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
can
be
rendered
rather
than
a
new
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
must
assume
that
this
whole
case
with
the
unlawfully
admitted
evidence
is
properly
in
the
picture.
and
then
we
ex
it
out
only
for
the
new
trial
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
addressed
it
but
not
at
some
length.
you
have
two
citations
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
you
do
that
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
say
neely
is
inapplicable
because
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
included
those
experts
in
the
record
when
it
made
the
judgment
just
as
though
it
had
been...
evidence
had
been
lawfully
admitted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
see
it
if
you
did.
you
just
have
the
quotation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
improperly
excluded
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
hogan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
hogan,
the...
the
plaintiff
argued
that
suppose
this
had
happened
in
the
district
court,
that
the
district
court
said,
oh,
my
goodness,
i
should
not
have
allowed
that
evidence
in.
so,
i'm
instructing
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
defendant.
then
the
rules
give
the
plaintiff
the
10
days
to
move
for
a
new
trial.
and
the
plaintiff
could
have
gone
to
the
district
judge
and
said,
notwithstanding
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence,
please
give
me
a
new
trial.
and
the...
the
plaintiff
says,
we
should
have
the
same
opportunity
when
the
court
of
appeals,
rather
than
the
district
judge,
makes
the
ruling
that
our
evidence
was
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
talking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
not
talking
about
the
conditional
motion.
i'm
saying
suppose
the
trial
judge
had
ruled
in
your
favor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--after
the
jury
verdict
came
in
on
the
renewed
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
the
district
judge
has
that
discretion.
the
district
judge
says,
okay,
on
this
case
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
nonetheless,
i'm
going
to
give
the
plaintiff
a
new
trial.
you
as
the
defendant
at
that
point
could
not
go
up
on
appeal
on
that,
could
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why?
because
whatever
reason,
the
district
judge
could
be
altogether
wrong,
but
you
would
not
have
a
final
judgment
if,
instead
of
entering
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
ordered
a
new
trial.
you
can't
appeal
at
that
stage,
can
you?
the
judge
enters...
says,
we'll
have
a
new
trial.
can
you
go
up
on
appeal
at
that
point?
where
is
your
final
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you're
incorrect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
mr.
strandness'
argument
that
there's
this
theory
of
circumstantial
evidence
under
north
dakota
law
on
which
they
could
have
prevailed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
respective
authority
of
federal
trial
at
appellate
courts
to
decide
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
judgment
should
be
entered
in
favor
a
verdict
loser.
the
case
resulted
from
a
tragic
episode.
bonnie
weisgram
died
when
her
home
caught
fire,
her
son
petitioner
chad
weisgram,
won
a
jury
verdict
against
respondent
marley
company,
the
manufacturer
of
an
allegedly
defective
heater
installed
in
bonnie
wiesgram’s
home.
at
trial,
heater
manufacturer
marley
repeatedly
objected
to
the
testimony
of
three
witnesses
presented
by
weisgram
as
experts,
identifying
the
alleged
heater
defect
as
the
cause
of
the
fire.
marley
urged
that
the
witnesses’
testimony
was
unreliable
and
therefore
inadmissible
under
the
standard
this
court
set
in
daubert
against
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals
and
follow-up
decisions.
the
trial
court
overruled
marley’s
objection
and
denied
marley’s
request
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
on
appeal,
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
and
directed
entry
of
judgment
for
marley.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
testimony
of
weisgram’s
witnesses
was
inadmissible
and
concluded
that
the
reaming
properly
admitted
evidence
was
inefficient
to
support
the
jury’s
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
we
granted
review
noting
that
court
of
appeals
have
disagreed
on
the
question
whether
it
consistent
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
50
and
appellate
court
may
direct
the
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
in
this
circumstance.
we
now
affirm
the
eighth
circuit
judgment.
in
a
1967
case
neely
against
martin
k.
eby
construction
company,
we
explained
that
if
a
defendant’s
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
is
erroneously
denied
by
the
trial
court,
the
appellate
court
has
three
options:
it
may
order
a
new
trial;
or
it
may
remand
the
case
for
the
trial
court
to
decide
whether
a
new
trial
or
entry
of
judgment
is
warranted;
or
finally
it
may
direct
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
defendant.
adhering
to
neely's
reasoning
we
reject
weisgram’s
argument
that
appellate
courts
lack
authority
to
choose
the
third
course,
directing
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
when
the
proof
becomes
inadequate
upon
exercising
erroneously
admitted
testimony.
in
this
circumstance,
no
less
than
when
a
plaintiff
fails
to
produce
sufficient
evidence
in
the
first
place,
an
appellate
court
has
authority
to
render
the
final
decision.
in
sum,
if
in
a
particular
case,
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
the
trial
court
is
better
positioned
to
decide
a
new
trial
rather
than
judgment
for
the
defendant
should
be
ordered,
the
appellate
court
should
of
course
return
the
case
to
the
trial
court,
for
such
an
assessment.
but
if
as
in
the
instant
case,
the
court
of
appeals
reasonably
concludes
that
further
proceedings
are
unwarranted
because
the
loser
on
appeal
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
present
the
case
including,
making
arguments
for
a
new
trial,
the
appellate
court
may
appropriately
instruct
the
trial
court
to
enter
their
judgment
against
the
jury
verdict
winner.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous.
