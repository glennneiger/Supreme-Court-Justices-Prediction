justice
david
h.
souter
--one
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
also
had
an
opportunity
after
you
had
lost
to
come
in
with
a
rehearing
motion
saying,
no,
don't
enter
judgment,
either
give
us
a
new
trial
because
we
represent
we
have
other
experts
to
substitute
for
those
who
were
found
incompetent
or
remand
to
the
district
court
so
that
we
can
convince
the
district
court
that
we
have
new
experts
to
substitute.
you
didn't
do
that
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
asked
for
a
new
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
think
you
explained
why.
in
other
words,
you
didn't...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
you
did
not
represent
to
the
court
that...
that
you
had
other
experts
to
substitute,
experts
whom
you
believed
would
be
competent
to
testify
to
substitute
for
the...
for
the
ones
whose
testimony
was
thrown
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?
i
mean,
what
i'm
saying
is
you
could
represent
to
the
court
at
the
rehearing
stage
that
it
should
not
enter
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
because
you,
if
allowed,
will
produce
these...
these
witnesses.
and
you
don't
have
to
have
a
record
below
to
say
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it's
the
jury
that
was
not
making
the
judgment
comparable
to
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
it
was
the
district
court
that
was
supposed
to
make
the
judgment
comparable
to
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
and
the
district
court
was
supposed
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
what
rule
50(a)(1)
refers
to
as
legally
sufficient
evidence.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
doing
here
when
it
reviews
on...
on
a
claim
of
error.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
difference...
the
only
difference
that
i
understand
is
they
have
determined
that
the
testimony
of
certain
experts
was
not
legally
sufficient
evidence,
and
therefore
they
review
the
record
on
the
basis
of
what
the
record
should
be
to
determine
whether
there
was
evidentiary
sufficiency.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that's...
that
has
nothing
to
do,
as
i
understand
it,
with
rule
50.
that
simply
has
to
do
with
their
failure
to
take
into
consideration
a...
a
rule
of...
of
north
dakota
law,
and
you
were
free...
and
i
presume
did
bring
that
up
in
your
motion
for
rehearing.
you
say,
look,
you
made
a
mistake.
you...
you
know,
you...
you
missed
the
north
dakota
rule.
but
that
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
rule
50.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they
either
agreed
with
you
or
not,
but
that
isn't
what
this
case
is
about
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we...
we've
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
some
discretion
here,
and
it
seems
to
me,
therefore,
that
your
argument
boils
down
to
this,
that
i
created
an
evidentiary
or
a
basis
in
pleadings
or
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
the...
the
court
really
should
have
exercised
its
discretion
to
let
the
district
court
decide
this.
and...
and
isn't
that
what
the
issue
boils
down
to
then?
not...
not
that
they
never
could...
could
decide
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
that
in
this
case
they
shouldn't,
and
therefore
the
issue
comes
down
to
what
should
the
standard
be
to...
for
determining
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should
do
it
or
whether
it
should
remand.
is...
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to
at
this
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
going
to
have
to
do
some
overruling
to
do
that,
won't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
i...
i
don't
know
that
that's
consistent
with
neely,
and
it
certainly
does
not
seem
to
be
consistent
with
the
last
sentence
of
50(d)
which
justice
breyer
has
quoted.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
what
about
the
case
in
which
the
trial
court
doesn't
even
get
to
the...
the
question
of
the
trial
court
ruling?
the...
the
individual
says,
well,
i...
i
know
that
ms.
hogan
won
her
case
in
the
supreme
court,
and
therefore
i've
got
to
put
in
all
these
witnesses,
no
matter
how
cumulative,
because
if
i
don't
and
one
of
them
gets
knocked
out
on
appeal,
i'm
out
of
the
game.
isn't...
isn't
your
rule
necessarily
going
to...
going
to
force
plaintiffs
to
present
cumulative
evidence
if
they've
got
it
in
any
case
in
which
there
may
be
some
question
about
an
expert's
qualifications--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
for
that
matter,
the
admissibility
of
any
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
may...
why
isn't
it
persuasive?
justice
david
h.
souter
because,
i
mean,
on...
on
the
argument
that
you've
just
made,
if
all
the
cumulative
testimony
had
gone
in
and
one
witness
was
then
thrown
out
for
incompetence
on
appeal,
there
would
be
other
evidence
in
there
that
would
sustain
the
verdict
and,
in
fact,
the...
the
plaintiff
would
win
the
case.
and
the
plaintiffs'
argument
here...
the
petitioners'
argument
here
is
that
that's
what
we're
going
to
have
to
do
in
order
to
avoid
being
thrown
out
of
court
for
insufficiency
of
evidence
if
we
lose
on
the
qualifications
of
one
expert
on
appeal.
why
isn't
that
a
good
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
hypo
was
going
to
be,
look,
the
plaintiff
has
got
responsibility
to
choose
the
best
witness.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
plaintiff
gets
it
wrong,
too
bad.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
the
answer,
then
the...
then
the
trial
court
doesn't
have
an
obligation
to
allow
cumulative
witnesses
even
if
the
plaintiff
wants
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so,
that
means
that
they
have
no
right
to
a
new
trial
in...
in
justice
stevens'
situation.
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
it
error
if
the...
i.e.,
abuse
of
discretion,
to
grant
them
a
new
trial
anyway?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
answer
is
no?
you
wouldn't
be
granted
any--
