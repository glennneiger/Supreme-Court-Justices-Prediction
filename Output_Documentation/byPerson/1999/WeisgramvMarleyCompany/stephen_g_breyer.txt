justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
truncated
record
in
the
rule.
i
thought
the
relevant
rule
is
rule
(d),
50(d).
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
seems
to
say,
it
says,
if
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
is
denied.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
denied.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
it
talks
about
the
prevailing
party.
that's
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
says
if
the
appellate
court
reverses,
which
is
what
they
did...
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
nothing
in
this
rule
precludes
it
from
determining
that
the
appellee
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
seems
to
me
it
might
or
it
might
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
your
case
they
said
no,
in
part
because
you
never
asked
for
one,
and
in
part
because
when
you
did
get
around
to
asking
one
in
your
motion
for
a
new...
you
know,
your
motion
to
reconsider
after
the
appellate
opinion,
you
never
gave
a
reason.
that
is
to
say,
you
never
pointed
to
anything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
would
say
that
you
have
some
more
evidence
to
put
in.
so,
those
are
all
my
questions.
and
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
only
have
10
days
to
do
this
in
the...
you
know,
in
the
district
courts.
here
you
have
4
days
more,
and
i
guess
it
doesn't
take
more
than
a
sentence
to
say,
we
didn't
think
you'd
decide
the
retrial
issue
yourself.
that's
sentence
one.
but
you
shouldn't
because.
and
then
you
have
only
four
more
sentences
to
go.
and
i
have
not
to
this
day...
i
mean,
litigation
is
time
and
money
for
everybody,
and
courts
of
appeals
don't
like
to
put
everybody
through
unnecessary
hoops.
so,
to
this
day,
i
haven't...
i
would
have
thought
you
were
dead
in
the
water,
as
did
they,
without
your
three
experts.
so,
without
those
three
experts,
tell
me
now
what
is
it
you'd
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
you're
arguing
with
their
summary
judgment
decision.
that's
different.
i'm
saying,
given
their
decision,
to
this
day
i
haven't
found
in
your
brief
any
new
evidence
that
you'd
introduced,
and
i
think
there
is
none.
and
i'm
just
putting
this
question
to
be
sure
there's
none.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
you
didn't
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
just
what
you've
told
me
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
know?
maybe
they
would
have
wanted
to
introduce
another
witness
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
i...
i
can't
decide
between
two
things
you're
arguing.
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
you're
saying
the
following,
which
would
be
a
big
issue.
i
don't
know...
i
don't
think
it's
in
front
of
us,
but
you're
saying
that
what
was
wrong
with
the
truncated
record
is
that
a
court
of
appeals,
when
it
decides
whether
a
party
should
have
been
granted
summary
judgment,
it
must
consider
illegally
admitted
evidence.
now,
are
you
arguing
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
you
are
not
arguing
that
and
you
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
consider
only
the
properly
admitted
evidence,
then
i
don't
really
see
what
you're...
how
you
can
win
because
their
judgment
was
on
the
properly
admitted
evidence,
well,
there's
nothing
to
have
a
new
trial
about.
i
mean,
you
haven't
made
enough
of
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
what
he's
thinking
of,
i
think,
is
the
following.
there
are
two
situations.
situation
one
is
when
an
appeal
court
looks
at
the
whole
record
and
says,
look,
there
just
isn't
enough
evidence.
okay?
defendant,
you
win.
now,
in
that
situation,
they
can
say
no
new
trial.
then
there's
a
second
situation.
it's
where
they
look
at
the
whole
record
and
the
whole
testimony
or
half
of
it
is
mr.
smith's,
and
they
say
mr.
smith
shouldn't
have
been
admitted.
and
for
that
reason,
he
concedes
they
can
give
summary
judgment
to
the
defendant.
but
if
it's
that
situation,
for
purposes
of
a
new
trial
possibility,
they
ought
to
let
the
trial
judge
decide
it.
now,
i
think
that's
what
they're
saying,
and
that
leaves
room
for
neely
and
for
the
rule
because
it's
saying
not
always.
if
you
have
the
kind
of
record
where
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
excising
a
witness,
then
of
course
the
trial
judge
can,
though
it
doesn't
have
to,
just
give
summary
judgment
outright.
the
trial...
the
court
of
appeals.
but
if
it's
this
other
situation,
which
is
theirs,
then
they
should
let
the
district
court
go
first.
now,
that's
why
they
didn't
think
neely
was
relevant,
that
relevant,
et
cetera,
and
that's
why
they
kept
saying...
talked
about
a
truncated
record,
et
cetera.
that's
my
understanding
of
it,
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
on
that
argument,
it
is
true
what
they
said
about
neely.
so,
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see,
they're
saying
there
are
two
sufficiency
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
type
a
where
nobody
is
talking
about
a
witness
not
being
there.
it's
just
a
question
of
on
this
record
was
it
sufficient.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
there's
type
b
where
the
reason
it's
insufficient
is
because
without
witness
smith
it's
insufficient,
though
with
witness
smith
it
would
be
sufficient.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
they're
saying
we
should
elaborate
neely.
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
we
should
do
it.
i'm
just
trying
to
make
what
i
understand
is
their
argument
so
you
can
address
it.
so,
what's
the
because?
they're
saying
it
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
in
that
situation.
appellate
courts
don't
know
whether
or
not
there
really
is
the
right...
the
possibility
of
introducing
a
substitute
witness
or
not,
and...
and
it
would
make
an
awful
lot
of
sense
and
it
would
save
everybody
time.
that's
their
kind
of
argument
alright--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no.
see,
it
gives
meaning
to
rule
50(d).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
they're
not
denying
it.
they're...
they're
not
denying
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
i
don't...
then
i
may
be
lost
in
this
and
it
may
be
my
fault.
but
i
thought
all
they're
arguing
for
is
the
following,
that
in
a
situation
where
there's
the
summary
judgment,
because
you
kick
out
a
witness,
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
a
chance
to
say
to
the
trial
judge,
judge,
i
know
we
didn't
have
enough
evidence,
but
look
at
this
special
circumstance.
they
kicked
us
out
on
a
witness
technicality.
we
have
six
others
we
could
introduce
instead.
please,
it's
totally
unfair
not
to
give
us
a
new
trial.
now,
all
they
want
is
the
opportunity
to
make
that
argument.
and
now,
i
don't
see
here
why
we
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
they're
denied
that
opportunity
because
maybe
they
didn't
present
the
court
of
appeals
enough
to
even
get
them
anywhere.
but
why
shouldn't...
a
normal
case,
they
have
an
opportunity--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
why
not
have
the
opportunity
even
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
say,
judges,
please
let
the
district
court
make
this
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
what
would
be
at
issue.
what
would
be
at
issue
would
be
the
litigation
history.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
the
same
in
the
court
of
appeals,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
they'd
have...
isn't
it?
is
there
any
reason
we
shouldn't
just
say
that?
it's
discretionary.
if
they
have
sense
very
often
and
it's...
it
looks
as
if
there's
some
real
matter
of
fairness
raised,
you'd
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
is
not,
you
just
can't
imagine
how
they
could
give
a
new
trial
in
this
circumstance
and
you're
not
presented
with
anything
that
would
suggest
it
was
unfair,
then
you'd
say,
okay,
there's
no
point.
let's
not
waste
time.
i
mean,
is
that
basically
your
opinion
how
it
works?
