justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we...
i
take
it
the
case
is
being
argued
on
the
assumptions,
a,
that
the...
the
expert
testimony
was
properly
stricken,
and
b,
that
without
it,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
return
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
those...
those
are
the
predicates
on
which
we're
going
to
proceed
in
our
argument
this
morning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so...
and
your
position
is
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
the
evidence
submitted
to
the
jury
was
insufficient
to
justify
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff,
it
may
never
order
a
judgment
for
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that
that
is
your
position,
and
i...
and
i...
when
you
say
things
were
deleted
from
the
record,
by
reason
of
the
expert
testimony
going--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but...
but
that's...
that's
always
the
case
when...
when
you
find
the
testimony
of
an
expert
witness
is
inadmissible.
it's
just
no
longer
part
of
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we've
gone
a
long
way
from
justice
breyer's
initial
question
about
the
last
sentence
of
rule
50(d).
it
seems
to
me
that
a
logical,
proper,
and
necessary
interpretation
of
that
is
that
in
some
instances
the
court
of
appeals
may
reverse
the
judgment
without
granting
you
a
new
trial.
that's
just
implicit
in
that
sentence.
and
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
get
away
from
the
language
of
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
fairness
issue...
you're
asking
us
then
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion,
but
we
don't
have
that
issue
before
us
by
reason
of
what
we've
already
established.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your...
your
same
argument
would
apply
in
that
case.
you'd
say,
oh,
if
i
had
only
known,
we
would
have
had
a
different
theory.
i'd
have
a
truncated
record
and
a
full
record
doesn't
make
a
lot...
lot
of
sense.
you
can
still
say,
oh,
we
were
trapped.
we...
our...
the
motion
in
limine
for
the
defendant
was
denied,
so
we
proceeded
on
this
theory.
if
only
we
had
known,
we
would
have
had
another
theory.
so,
your
argument
is
the
same.
