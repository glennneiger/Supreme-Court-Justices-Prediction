rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
99-161,
chad
weisgram
v.
the
marley
company.
mr.
strandness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strandness,
i
noticed
that
in
the...
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion,
the
opinion
of
the
majority,
they
did
not
cite
the
martin
eby
case
from
this
court
which
seems
to
me
to
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong.
i
presume
you
will
deal
with
that
case
in
your
discussion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
then
you're
saying
in...
i...
i
think
what
you
just
said
perhaps
is
inconsistent
or
at
least
it
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
he...
you
say
you're
not
saying
that
has
to
be
done
in
every
case,
but
you're
saying
that
the
fairest
and
best
rule
would
be.
are...
do
you
leave
nothing
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you...
i
think
you
run
right
up
against
our
martin
eby
case
if
you
don't
leave
discretion
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
there's...
there's
virtually
no
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
grant
summary
judgment.
it's
simply,
you
know,
is
there
any
material
fact
in
dispute.
the
district
court
doesn't
evaluate
witnesses,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
much
in
the
same
position
here,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
how...
how
you
distinguish
the
martin
eby
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
thought
there
it
said
it's
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
whether
it
wants
to
remand
for
a
new
trial
or
enter
judgment
for
the...
for
the
party
that
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the...
did
the
respondent
in
this
case
in
his
brief
to
the
eighth
circuit
ask
that
judgment
be
entered
for
the...
for
the
respondent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
knew
at
that
time
at
any
rate
that
the
respondent's
view
was
if
he
prevailed
or
it
prevailed
on
the
expert
testimony,
that
they...
they
wanted
judgment
entered
there
and
not
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of...
anytime
you
file
a
motion
for
a
rehearing,
you're
asking
the
judges
to
reconsider
something
they
did;
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
file
a
petition
for
rehearing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
ordinarily
we
don't
take
cases
just
to
correct
errors.
the
court
of
appeals
will
correct
errors.
we
do
not
take
cases
to
correct
errors.
and
our
assumption
i
think
was
that
some
fairly
broad
principle
was
involved
here,
and
i
guess
it
is,
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
any
discretion
at
all
to
enter
judgment
for
the...
for
the
prevailing
party
in
a
situation
like
this
or
must
it
always
remand
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
must
always
let
the
district
court
decide.
then
it
seems
to
me
you
are
in
conflict
with
our
martin
eby
case
which
said
that
the...
the
court
of
appeals
had
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
language
in
that
case
that
suggests
that
it
wouldn't
cover
that.
i
mean,
you
have
all
sorts
of
reversals
on
appeal
for,
you
know,
erroneous
admission
of
hearsay
evidence.
it
isn't
just
expert
testimony.
and
i
gather
you
would
say
that
that
too
would
be
a
truncated
record
where
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
discretion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
apparently
the
panel...
this
panel
thought
that
what
it
did
was
consistent
with
eighth
circuit
practice,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
here
it's...
it's
a...
it's
a
case
from
this
court
that
is
as
close
to
on
point
as
any
case
you
can
find.
and
as
my
colleagues
have
suggested,
you...
you
really
give
it
a
brush-off.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
on
page
22,
it's...
it's
not
discussed
at
all.
it's
just...
it's
cited
there
because
it's
part
of
another...
of
another
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strandness.
ms.
hogan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in...
in
neely,
i
guess,
this
court
said
that
the
district
court
is
in
no
better
position
than
the
court
of
appeals--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
dealing
with--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
sort
of
a
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
is
the
kind
of...
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
trial
lawyer
faces
all
the
time,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
i
try
to
get
this
in
with
a
business
record,
or
do
i
actually
call
the
witness
himself?
do
i
try
to
get
it
in
with
hearsay,
or
do
i
call
the
original
declarant?
and
those
kind
of
decisions
are
made
all
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
there
are
a
couple
courts
that
have
given
relief
by
mandamus
in
extreme
situations.
i...
i
think
justice
ginsburg
is
right.
i...
i
don't
see
that's
appealable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
really
isn't
before
the
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--any
question
of
north...
north
dakota
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hogan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
court
in
no.
99-161,
weisgram
versus
marley
company
will
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
