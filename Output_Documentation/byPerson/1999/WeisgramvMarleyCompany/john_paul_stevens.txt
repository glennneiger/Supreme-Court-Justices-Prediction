justice
john
paul
stevens
and
by
cases
that
were
ignored,
as
i
read
your
reply
brief,
you
did
not
respond
at
all
to
their
reliance
on
neely
against
eby
construction,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
reply
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
page
29,
you
talk
about
the
part
of
neely
that
says
there
may
be
grounds
for
a
new
trial
on
your
behalf.
but
i
think
that's
talking
about
grounds
for
a
new
trial
because
of
errors
made
by
the
trial
judge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
just
because
there
was
some
other
evidence
you
never
offered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
another
alternative.
it
seems
to
me
there's
another
alternative,
and
that
is
that
in
the
trial
proceedings,
they
may
have
listed
six
expert
witnesses
and
they
relied
on
three.
and
they
had
the
depositions
of
three
more
and
the
judge
said,
are
you
going
to
put
in
the
other
three?
and
the
plaintiff
says,
i
don't
think
i
need
them,
your
honor.
i
just...
because
i
don't
want
to
put
in
cumulative
evidence.
and
they
let
it
go
at
that.
and
then
they're
reversed
on
appeal
because
the
first
three
are
found
to
be
incompetent.
and
there
would
have
been
no
error
in
the
trial
court,
but
rather
a
tactical
decision
by
plaintiff's
counsel
not
to
put
in
cumulative
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
would
it
be
within
the
discretion
of
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
to
say,
well,
there
was
no
error,
but
we
think
the
trial
court
ought
to
look
at
that
evidence
and
see
if
that
might
have
made
up
the
deficiencies
and
justify
another
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
couldn't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
not
agree
that
neely
at
least
doesn't
pass
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the...
the
issue
of
court...
it's
very
clear
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
saying
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
had
power
to
do
what
they
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
right
answer
on
my
hypothetical,
but
i
don't
think
it's
been
decided
is
all
i'm
really
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
talking
about
being
in
the
dark,
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
the
dark
about
neely
because
it
didn't
cite
it,
and
i
was
concerned
about
the
reply
brief.
and
i
noticed
your
brief
in
opposition
didn't
cite
it
either.
you
apparently
didn't
find
the
case
until
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
cert
petition
was
filed
after
the
court
of
appeals
entered
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
didn't
call
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
neely
might
be
a
strong
case
on
your
side
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition.
apparently
you
didn't
find
the
case
until
you
got
around
to
briefing
the
merits
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
give
you
a
slight
variation
on
the
hypothetical.
supposing
that
the...
you
just
have
one
expert
to
make
it
simple.
and
the
error
of
the
trial
judge
was
in
allowing
all
of
the
expert
testimony
be
put
in
in
the
form
of
leading
questions.
and
on
appeal,
they
said
all
those...
you
strike
all
the
answers
to
the
leading
questions.
they
were
improper.
could
they
then
go
ahead
and
enter
judgment
without...
as
a
matter
of
law
without
allowing
a
retrial
to
try
and
get
the
same
information
with
proper
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
have
the
record
and
you
just
expunge
from
the
record
all
the
answers
to
the
leading
questions.
and
the
plaintiff
could
say,
well,
if
i
had
realized
he
wasn't
going
to
let
me
ask
leading
questions,
i
would
have
framed
my
questions
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
say
he
loses
completely
because
he's
expunged
from
the
record
the
improper...
the
answers
to
the
improperly
framed
questions.
