justice
antonin

you...
you
phrase
the...
the
decision
a
little
tendentiously.
you
said
that...
that
they
determined
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
produce
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
they...
they
didn't
really
do
that.
they...
they
decided
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
produced--
justice
antonin
scalia
--enough
evidence
to...
to
entitle
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
that's
what
the
issue
is,
whether...
whether
the
plaintiff
has
to
be
given
another
chance.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
basis?
what
is
the
criterion
that
you
want
the
trial
court
to...
to
apply?
whether
it
guesses
that
the
plaintiff
could
come
up
with
another
expert
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
a
court
abuse
its...
what...
what
are
the
criteria
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
whether
you
allow
a
new
trial
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
come
to
my
question.
what...
what
is
the
criterion
for
a
new
trial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
could
cause
there
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
a
good
argument.
i
think
your...
your
response
is,
of
course,
they'll
try
to
cumulate
evidence.
but
the
court
won't
allow...
won't
allow
them
to,
and
the
court
will
simply
say
pick
your
best
expert.
don't
ask
me
to
make
that
judgment.
you're
trying
this
case.
we
have
an
adversary
system.
pick
your
best
expert.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
going
to
allow
you
to
bring
in
a
parade
of
experts
just
because
you...
you
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--gamble
on
the
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you
don't
think
a
trial
court
ever
has
to
allow
cumulation
of
experts
or
of
any
other
testimony
for
the
reason
that,
well,
one
of
them
may...
may
be
found
to
have
been
improperly
admitted.
does
a
trial
court
ever
have
to
take
that
into
account,
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
his...
his
point
about
the
truncated
record
is
that
it
is
the
record
without
the
testimony
of
this
witness.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
same
record
that
the...
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
use
on
remand.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
justice
ginsburg
posits
a
district
judge
who's
willing
to
reopen
it.
would
you
say
that
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
hypothetical
that
she
posed?
the
district
judge
says,
my
god,
i...
you
know,
i
made
a
mistake
letting
in
that...
that
expert
witness'
testimony,
and
therefore
i
have
to
reverse
the...
set
aside
the
jury
verdict.
however,
i'm
going
to
grant
a
new
trial
because
i
was
at
least
as
guilty
as
you
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why...
then...
then
it
wouldn't
be...
i
assume
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
done
that
also.
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
no
more
of
a
factual
basis
than
in
the
hypothetical
i've
just
given
you.
no
more
than,
you
know,
your
honor,
it
was
a
mistake,
at
least
as
much
the
district
court's
fault
as
it
was
ours.
we
think
we
can
come
up
with
a
better
expert
witness.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
was
my
hypothetical.
why
does
it
differ
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals?
if
the
court
of
appeals
can't
do
it,
i
don't
see
why
the
district
court
can
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
district
court
can
do
it,
i
don't
understand,
you
know,
why
it
wouldn't
be
proper
for
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
if
that
point
were
correct,
wouldn't
it...
wouldn't
it
go
to
showing
that
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
incorrect,
not
that
there
should
be
a
new
trial,
but
that
there
should
not
have
been
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
go
to
the
new
trial
issue.
