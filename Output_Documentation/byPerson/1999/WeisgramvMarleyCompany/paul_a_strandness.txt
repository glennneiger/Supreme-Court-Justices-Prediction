mr.
paul
a.
strandness
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it...
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
diversity
case
that
was
tried
under
north
dakota
law
arising
out
of
a
fire
that
resulted
in
the
death
of
bonnie
weisgram.
after
a
2-week
trial,
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
in
a
split
2
to
1
decision,
finding
that
certain
expert
testimony,
or
portions
of
their
testimony,
had
been
improperly
admitted
by
the
district
court
judge.
in
addition
to
reversing
the
decision,
the
court
decided,
on
review
of
the
record,
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
produce
a
case
on
which
it
would
be
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
and,
therefore,
directed
judgment
be
entered
on
behalf
of
the
defendants.
that
ruling
was
error.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
i
will,
your
honor.
the
question
becomes
what
happens
next,
what
happens
next
to
this
case
once
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
this
decision.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
this--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--justice
scalia,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
take
the
record
and
to
delete
from
that
record
that
was
before
the
jury
excerpts
of
experts'
testimony.
then
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
that
record
and
decided
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict
and
then
issued
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
defendant.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
the...
it's
not
before
the
court
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
properly
or
improperly--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--that's
not
our
position,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
there
has
been
testimony
that
has
been
deleted
from
the
record,
that
the
fairest
and
best
rule
would
be
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
determinations
according
to
the
evidentiary
rulings
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
i
would--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals
involves
situations
where
the
record
is
left
intact
and
they're
simply
looking
at
the
record
to
make
determinations
as
sufficiency
of
the...
the
evidence
that
was
heard
by
the
jury.
and
justice
kennedy,
in
his
question
to
me...
i
guess
i
would
say
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
that
what
we're
asking
for
is
an
automatic
remand
rule.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
it
was--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--exactly,
but
what
is
different--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
trial
court
is
in
the
best
position
because
the
trial--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--the
same
criteria
that
any
trial
court,
any
district
court,
uses
in
exercising
discretion
in
making
decisions
such
as
admitting
expert
testimony,
on
making
decisions
as
to
whether
or
not
to
grant
summary
judgment,
as
to
making
decisions
as
to
whether
or
not--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--no,
it's
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
situation
here
is
we've
got
an
artificial
record.
this
is
a
truncated
record
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
looking
at.
it's
not
the
same
record
that
the
jury
below
saw.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals,
in
essence,
is
doing
is
confusing
two
rules,
rule
50
which
involves
motions
dealing
with
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
with
rule
59
which
has
to
do
with
errors
committed
by
the
trial
court
and
then--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--how
do
i
distinguish
that?
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
the...
the
chief
way
i
would
distinguish
that
case
is
simply
by
the
fact
that
this...
that
that
case
did
not
involve
a
truncated
record.
there
was--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--that's...
that's
one
of
the
rules
that
apply--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
well,
that--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--justice
breyer...
justice
breyer,
it's...
it's
obviously
a
situation
in
which
in
looking
at
whether
or
not
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
a
suitable
place
to
make
an
argument
for
a
new
trial,
it
just
simply
doesn't
serve
that
purpose.
it's
an
inadequate
way
for
a
litigant
to
address
this
issue.
now,
to...
to
really
answer
your
question,
i
need
to
back
up
a
little
bit
and...
and
walk
through
what
occurred
here
in
this
case.
we
rested
our
case
on
the
evidence
that
had
been
submitted
to
the
jury
with
the
expectation
that
the
trial
court's
rulings
were
sound,
that
they
were
sufficient
and
that
the
evidence
that
the
jury
was
going
to
be
hearing
would
be
reliable
and
would
be
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
we
were...
we
were
tipped
off
that
there
were
objections
raised
during
the
trial,
but
the
trial
court...
the
judge
in
our
trial
heard
those
arguments
and
rejected
them.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct,
but
i
think
what
you're
referring
to,
justice
ginsburg,
is
perhaps
a
conditional
motion
for
a...
a
new
trial,
and
that
typically
arises
in
a
situation
where
the
prevailing
party
also
has
reasons
to
take
issue
with
the
trial
court's
rulings.
in
other
words,
there
were
some
rulings
that
took
place
during
the
trial
that
were
against
the
prevailing
party's
interest.
and
a
conditional
reservation
of
objection
to
that
is...
is
the
normal
practice
and
that
is
what
is
done.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
we
could
have,
but
again
it's
a
question
of
as
a
litigant
that
has
won
at
each
step
of
the
procedure,
if
my
client
was
listening
to
me
asking
for
a
new
trial
when
we're
winning,
they
would...
he
would
have
questions
about
my
sanity.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
and...
and
that's
why
the
rule
provides
that
if
there
is
a
judgment
entered
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the...
the
non-movant
or
the
person
that
lost
that...
that
motion
has
10
days
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
well,
we
did...
we
did
ask--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--we
asked
for--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--and
there's
a
reason
for
that,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
record
that
is
before
the
appellate
court
is
much
different
than
the
record
that
exists
in
the
trial
court
level,
and--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--but
it's
not...
it's
not
a
realistic
opportunity
to
make
that
kind
of
an
argument.
you
have
14
days
to...
to
file
the
papers.
you're
limited
to
15
pages.
the
rule
is
very
clear.
it
has
to
be
limited
to
misapprehensions
of
fact
or
of
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked.
we
already
had
two
of
the
three
panel
members
on
their
own,
sua
sponte,
say
no
new
trial
should
be
granted
to
this
petitioner.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
also
in
looking
at
realistically
how
often
is
a
petition
for
rehearing
granted
in
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--north
dakota
is
very
unique.
north
dakota
recognizes
circumstantial
evidence
for
proving
a
product
defect,
and
we
did
bring
this
up
in
our
petition
for
rehearing,
that
the
court
of
appeals
totally
overlooked
the
fact
that
under
north
dakota
law--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--there
is
new
evidence.
the
new
evidence
would
be
we
had
two
other
experts
that
were
listed
that
were
not
called
during
the
trial
that
could
have
been
used.
if
we
had
gotten
these
rulings
that
occurred
on
the
appellate
level,
if
they
had
occurred
during
the
trial--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--we
didn't
have
a
realistic
opportunity
to
do
so,
to...
to
respond
in
such
short
notice
and
to
refer
to
things
that
were
not
in
the
record.
the
fact
that
those
other
experts
exist
does
not
appear
in
the
record
that
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it...
it
appears
in
the
record
that
was
before
the
trial
court
because
this
was
discovery
motions
that
were
not
part
of
the
record
that
went
up
because
that
wasn't
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
because
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
decide
is
a
fairness
issue,
and
it's
a
fairness
issue
that
deals
with
a
very
unique
situation
that
occurred
here.
and
it...
the
situation
that
occurred
was
the
truncating
of
a
record.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
we're
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error
by
not
sending
this
case
back
down
to
the
trial
court
for
a
determination
as
to,
under
their
evidentiary
rulings,
what
should
happen
to
the
case.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
our
position
is
that
it
must
always
remand
for
further
proceedings.
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
well,
but
the
martin
eby
case
again
involved
a...
a
record
that
had
not
been
deleted.
it
was
not
a
truncated
record.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
where
hearsay--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--was
taken
out?
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
the
testimony.
yes,
that
would
be
a
truncated
record.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
justice
ginsburg,
it
goes
back
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
montgomery
ward.
in
montgomery
ward,
this
court,
2
years
after
the
federal
rules
were
promulgated,
addressed
the
issue
of
rule
50
and
rule
59,
and
in
the
montgomery
ward
case,
the...
this
court
stated
that
these
are
two
separate
motions.
these
are
two
separate
rules
that
can't
be
interchanged
between
the
two.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
situation...
the
eighth
circuit...
is
they...
they
basically
took
a
rule
59
motion,
which
deals
with
error
of
law,
error
committed
by
the
district
court,
and
then
excised
the
testimony.
a
rule
59
motion
typically
lies
as
to
whether
or
not
a
new
trial
should
be
determined,
but
then
they
took
one--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--but...
but
when
you're
looking
at
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
after
the
jury
has
already
decided
the
case,
it's
different
than
looking
at
it
before
the
jury
has
returned
its
verdict.
what
happened
in
this
case,
in
the
weisgram
case,
is
that
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict,
the
court
of
appeals
then
excised
out
testimony,
creating
a
record
that
was
not
the
same
record
that
was
before
the
jury,
and
then--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--it
makes
a
difference
that
the...
the
court
of
appeals
was
looking
at
a
record
that's
totally
different
than
what
the
jury
heard
for
purposes
of
making
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
determination--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--it...
there's
a
difference,
though,
your
honor,
and
the
difference
comes
in
that
the
appellate
court...
if
you
look
at
what
they
have
before
them
to
make
determinations
as
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
as
opposed
to
the
district
court
level,
there's
a
whole
world
of
difference
between
what
they're
able
to
see
as
far
as
how
the
trial
was
conducted.
and
that's--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--but
then
they
took
the
next
step
and
issued
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
ignoring,
for
example,
north
dakota
law,
circumstantial
evidence,
and
ignoring
the--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--we
did
bring
that
up
to
the--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--on
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
the
case
that's...
that
this
court
has
before
it
has
to
do
with
who's
in
the
best
position
to
make
this
decision
that
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--i
think
it
boils
down
to
a
better
rule
would
be
to
have
a
automatic
remand
whenever
this
issue
is
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
i--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--it's
perfectly
consistent
with
neely
for
the
simple
reason
that
neely
again
dealt
with
the
court
looking
at
the
entire
record,
the
entire
case
that
had
been
put
in
to
the
jury.
there
was
nothing
taken
out
of
that
record.
there
was
no
truncating
of...
of
testimony--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--well,
in
neely,
the
entire
case
went
in.
there
was...
there
was
not
anything
kept
out,
and
the
jury--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--heard
the
entire
evidence.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
well,
at
least
it
wasn't
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
we
are
not
arguing
that.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
except
that...
i
keep
getting
back
to
this,
and
i
think
it's
an
important
point...
in
montgomery
ward,
montgomery
ward
clearly
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
are
two
separate,
distinct...
and
they
use
the
term
offices
for
these
motions.
and
you've
got
rule
50,
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
which
has
an
office
for
determining
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
and
you've
got
rule
59
which
deals
with
errors
of
law.
if
you
truncate
a
record
that's
been
produced
for
a
jury
verdict
and...
and
then
apply
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
determination,
you're
mixing
up
those
two...
those
two
motions,
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
holding
of
montgomery
ward
stands
for.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
i...
i
did
misstate
my
position
on
that,
and
i
think
our
brief
does
make
that...
that
position
pretty
clear,
that
for
purposes
of
looking
at...
and
this...
this
is
the
midcontinent
decision.
this
is
the
eighth
circuit
decision
where
they
talk
about...
the
eighth
circuit
talks
about
the
fact
that
there's
an
unfair
reliance
that
goes
into
taking
expert
testimony
out
after
a
jury
has
come
back
and,
furthermore,
that
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
motion
cannot
be
made
on
a
truncated
record.
and
that's...
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
in
midcontinent
and
that
would
be
our
position
as
well
before
this
court.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
well,
the...
the
2-1
split
in
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
even
talk
about
midcontinent
in
their
decision.
it
was
totally
ignored,
and--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--we
did
talk
about
neely,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
in
our
reply
brief?
we
addressed
it
at
some
length
in
our...
in
our
main
petition
on
the
merits.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
i
think
our
position
that
we...
we
took
in
that
brief
was
that
it's
distinguishable
from
the
fact
that
the
situation
is
different
in
neely
as
it
is
in
this
case
because
of
the
truncated
record.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
well,
we
certainly
did
not
intend
to
brush
off
the
case
because
it
is
an
important
decision,
but
we...
we
did
feel
that
we've
laid
out
our
distinguishing
comments
as
to
why
that
case
does
not
apply
in
this
situation,
that
the...
there's
a
distinct
difference
between
neely
and
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
--where
do
we
do
that?
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
strandness
29
is
definitely
where
we
talk
about
it,
and...
and
i
thought
we
did
address
the
issue
as
