ms.
christine
a.
hogan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
in
the
earlier
argument
now.
it
is
correct
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
come
to
grips
with
or
address
neely
or
martin
k.
eby
as
it
is...
as
the
defendant's
name
is
in
their
brief,
either
in
their
reply
brief
or
in
their
main
brief.
and
i
believe
that
is
essentially
fatal
because
neely,
as
this
court
stated,
does
address
all
of
the
constitutional
questions
that
they
have
raised.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and...
and
that
is
their
argument
i
do...
i
believe.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
the
response
is
that
neely
does
address
a
sufficiency
case,
and
it
says
in
a
sufficiency
case,
it
is
up
to...
it
is
appropriate--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--yes,
and--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--and...
and--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--and
that
is
essentially
the
rule
56
or
summary
judgment
situation,
and
there
is
no
difference.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and
the
answer--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--the
answer
to
that
is
actually
the
question
you
raised
earlier
about
rule
50(d)
and...
and
rule
50(a).
rule
50--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--rule...
rule
50(a)
says
only
legally
sufficient
evidence.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and
evidence
that
is
not
competent,
that
is
not
uttered
by
qualified
witnesses
and
which
the
appellate
court
has
determined
is
inadmissible,
should
never
have
been
admitted
in
the
first
place,
is
not
legally
sufficient.
so,
rule
50
answers
all
of
those
questions,
as
does
neely.
so,
between
rule
50
and
neely,
all
of
the
constitutional
questions
and
all
of
the
procedural
and
all
of
the
protocol
questions
are
all
answered.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well,
that's
really
the
beauty
of
rule
50.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
yes.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
it--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--you
could
certainly...
a
court
could
abuse
its
discretion.
but
in
this
case
that's
not--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
if--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
and...
and
neely
did
say
that
the
appellate
court
and
the
trial
court
in
a
sufficiency
case
are
in
the
same
position.
the
trial
court
has
no
special
competence
in
a
sufficiency
case
to
address
the
new
trial
issue
because
the
whole
record
is
there.
and
there
is...
in
fact,
they
specifically
said
there
was
no
undue
burden
on
the
plaintiff
in
a
sufficiency
case
to
make
their
new
trial
argument
in
the
appellate
court.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
if--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--yes,
justice
scalia.
if
there
had
been
a
case
made
that
there
had
been
evidence
improperly
excluded
from
the
plaintiffs'
case,
that
could
have
filled
the
gap,
could
have
made
their
case
sufficient...
and
that's
really
what
neely
contemplated.
if
the
plaintiff
in
neely
had
made
such
a
case.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
improperly
excluded
by
the
district
court.
a
trial
court
error,
a
pre-verdict
error,
that
could
have
been
corrected
by
filling
the
gap.
but...
but
rule
50
allows
for
that.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
he's...
he's
still--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--i
think
the
better
rule
is
what...
what
the...
what
this
court
said
in
neely,
that
plaintiff
has
one
opportunity
to
put
in
their
best
case.
they
make
those
decisions--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--not...
not
on...
on
that
record,
no.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well,
it...
it
sort
of
does
because
in
neely
the
plaintiff
did
hint
in
their
supreme
court
brief
that
they
did
have
two
additional
witnesses,
and
the
court
said
it
was--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--yes.
i--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--i...
i
do
think,
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
a
party
going
into
a
product
liability
case
in
1997,
3...
4
years
after
daubert
has
set
down
the
criteria,
that
you
have
to
have
reliable
evidence,
you
have
to
have
qualified
witnesses.
they
know
going
in
who
their
three
best
are,
and
if
they
save
their
three
best
for
last
and
don't
use
them
because
they're
cumulative,
that's
something
they're
going
to
have
to
live
with
and
that's
their
mistake.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
very
typically
trial
judges
do
require
parties
to
limit
their
witnesses,
and
so
they
have
to
tell
the
court
they're
going
to
have
one
witness
on
this
point
and
one
witness
on
this
point.
to
each
witness
that
they
need
to
call
to
make
the...
an
essential
element
of
their
case,
they
have
to
choose
their
best
witness,
make
that
sufficient
evidence
for
that
particular
element
of
their
case,
and
that's
their
opportunity.
if
the
trial
court
said,
no,
you
have
to
have
this
all
go
through
one
witness,
and
that
witness
isn't
able
to
address
each
element
of
the
case,
that
might
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
no.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
no,
your
honor.
plaintiff
does
make
that
argument
in
their
brief.
they...
they
do
not
support
it
with
any
citation
to
anything.
i
do
not
find
it
persuasive.
counsel
know--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
because
counsel
know
what...
if
their...
if
their
witnesses
are
qualified
and
if
they
have
reliable
backup
for
their
opinions.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--i--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--i
should
point
out...
well,
it's...
it's
certainly
conceivable
that
there
might
be
a
situation
where
a
trial
court
would
become
overzealous
perhaps
in
limiting
the
number
of
witnesses
a
party
could
have.
that's
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
put
in
all
of
their
evidence
that
they
chose
to
put
in,
and
then
they
rested.
there
were
no--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--i...
i
think
if...
that
if
there
is...
it
would
be
better
to
allow
some
cumulation
of
testimony,
some
duplicative
testimony
at
the
trial
court
level
rather
than
what
the
plaintiffs
are
suggesting
is...
which
is
allow
automatic
retrials
in
every
case.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
i
certainly
do
agree
with
that.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
that
is...
that
is
my
position.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and...
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
a
party
is
going
to
be
encouraged
to
over-try
his
case
in
the
first
place.
what
we're
suggesting
with
rule
50
and
with
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
in
this
case
is
that
parties
are
encouraged
to
put
on
their
best
case,
and
if
they...
they
have
do
to
it
in
one
shot.
they
have
one
opportunity.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
they
did
have
the
opportunity
to--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
they
did
have
that
opportunity
in
their
petition
for
rehearing
had
they
wanted
to
make
that
case.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
on--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--that
is
absolutely
correct--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--mr.
chief
justice.
the
neely
court
said,
in
testing
the
sufficiency
of...
of
a
case,
you
have
the
entire
record.
and
i
should
point
out
that
there
were...
there
is
not
two
separate
records
here.
there
is
no
truncated
record.
the
appellate
court
looked
at
the
entire
record.
it
said
that
it
reviewed
it
very
carefully.
they...
they
did
not
review
some
hypothetical,
truncated,
artificial
record.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and
actually
the
litigation
history
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
that
tried
this
particular
case
was
not
familiar
with
it.
the
pretrial
material
was...
was
handled
all
by
the
magistrate
in
this
case.
everything
that
was
done
in
front
of
the
district
judge
in
this
case
is
on
the
record,
and
that
would
be
the
pretrial
conferences
on
the
daubert
issue
where
we
made
our
case
that
these
experts
should
be
excluded
in
the
first
place.
that
is
on
the
record.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
nothing
that's
not
on
the
record.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--and...
and
i
might
add
that
our
initial
motion
for...
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
made
on
the
entire
record,
and...
and
clearly,
the
eighth
circuit
reviewed
the
entire
record.
it
explicitly
said
that
it
reviewed
the
entire
record,
and
it
found
it
insufficient.
so,
we're
right
back
to
neely.
if
you
have
a...
an
insufficiency
situation
and
the
entire
record
is
before
the
appellate
court,
it
really
boils
down
to
an
efficiency
issue.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
yes,
it
is.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
they...
these
are...
these
are
well
known.
before
you
go
in,
you
know
what
the
daubert
criteria
are.
you
know
what
your
witnesses
are.
you
know
that
we
on
the
other
side
have
made
an
argument
which,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
should
have
sent
a
red
flag,
a
forewarning,
that
there
might
be
an
appeal
here
if...
if
the
trial
court
does
allow
inadmissible
testimony
to
come
in.
no
one
was
in
the
dark.
yes,
these
decisions
have
to
be
made
and
planned
before
trial
and
then--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--our
brief?
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
actually
the...
the
whole
neely
issue
did
not
come
up
until
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
granted.
that
is
correct.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
but
we--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--the...
that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
we...
but
we
certainly
were
aware
of
rule
50.
and
rule
50
is
based
on
neely
and
the...
and
that's
what
we
had
argued
in
the
first
place
in
the
trial
court.
and
we...
and
certainly
neely
does
decide
all
the
constitutional
issues.
and,
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
address
the
montgomery
ward
issue
that
counsel
has...
has
raised.
he
neglects
to
point
out
that
the
montgomery
ward
issue
is
also
decided
by
this
court.
it...
it
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
appellate
court
cannot
grant
judgment
nov.
in
fact
it
says...
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
montgomery
ward
decision...
the
appellate
court
may
reverse
the
former
action
and
itself
enter
judgment
nov
or
it
may
reverse
and
remand
for
a
new
trial
for
errors
of
law.
and
in
fact,
that's
what
neely
cited
as
grounds
for
its
decision
that
the
appellate
court
did
have
the
power
and...
and
in
sufficiency
cases
is
in
an...
is
in
an
equally
good
position
as
the
trial
court
to
make
the
decision.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
in
this
instance,
since
there
was
no
such
argument
made
to
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
equally
a
good...
as
good
a
position.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
but--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--yes.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and...
and
actually
that...
even
in
that
type
of
situation,
once
the
judgment
has
been
made,
unless
there
was
some
kind
of
error
that
the
trial
court
prevented
that
evidence
from
coming
in,
i...
that
issue
was
addressed
in...
in
the
navarro
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
a
plaintiff
argued,
after
summary
judgment
had
been
entered,
that
she
could
have
gotten
a
better
affidavit.
she
needed...
she
just
needed
time
to
go
back,
and
she
thought
there
would
be
a
deposition.
and
the...
and
the
court
said,
well,
if...
if
you're
just
coming
in
with
new
evidence
now
post-judgment
that's
not
new
evidence
that...
that
you
didn't
have
before,
that
a
great
many
plaintiffs,
a
great
many
cases
would
have
to
be
reopened
to
bring
in
new
evidence
that
you
didn't
think
of
or
didn't
put
in
originally.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well,
certainly
rule
50
gives
the
trial
court
that
discretion.
i
mean,
that...
the...
the...
rule
50
gives
the...
the
courts
and
the
parties
a
great
deal
of
flexibility.
the
parties
have
several
opportunities
to
make
their
case
and
the
court
has--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--it
might
not
be.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well,
had
they
been
given
a...
a
very
valid,
factual
basis
for
a
new
trial
by
these
plaintiffs--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
that--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--no.
a
better
expert
witness
i
think...
they
made
their...
they
made
their
plans--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
if--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--well,
rule
50
does
give
pre-verdict
an
opportunity
for
the
parties
to
go
back
and
fill
in
gaps
pre-verdict.
once
we're
post-judgment,
it's...
it
is
different.
the
record
is...
is
closed.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well,
it
would...
i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
those
circumstances
were
in
the
hypothetical.
i
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
coupled
with
the
fact
that
there
was
a
witness
not
called.
there
would
have
to
be
an
excusable
reason.
he
would
have
to--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--i
would
think
that
that
would
be
appealable.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
i
do...
i
do
believe,
judge
ginsburg,
that
in...
in
the
absence
of
some
extreme
error,
a
party
has
the
duty,
just
as
in
rule
56,
to
come
in
with
their
best
case
and
meet
the
essential
elements
of
their
case
with...
with
sufficient
evidence.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
well,
you
would
have
the
record
that
would
show--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
new
trial
in
that
situation.
the
appellate
court--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--a
party
has
a...
has
a
duty
under
our
rules.
our
rules,
all
of
our
rules
of...
of
civil
procedure,
particularly
rule
50
and
rule
56,
but
also
rule
26
and
rule
16...
they
are
all
designed
to
give
a
party
one
opportunity
to
list
their
witnesses,
to
choose
their
experts,
to
choose
how
they're
going
to
put
in
the
essential
elements
of
their
case,
and
do
it
in
one
shot.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
that
is
correct.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
rule
50
is
discretionary.
it
is...
it
is
framed
as
a
discretionary
decision.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
the
answer
is
no
probably.
it
might
not
be.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
and
if
there
is
not
and--
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
--that
is
my
position.
in
fact,
you...
you
put
your
finger
right
on
it
because
in
this
particular
case
it
is
correct
that
even
today
not
one
scrap
of
additional
evidence
has
been
even
alluded
to
that
would
change
the
results
here.
what
we
would
be
looking
at
is
a
futile,
wasteful
exercise
in
remanding
at
all.
the...
the
eighth
circuit
considered
the
remand
issue
and
found
no
basis
in
this
entire
record,
no
fairness
issue.
the
plaintiffs
were
fully
protected
in
this
case
because
they
had
their
full
opportunity.
ms.
christine
a.
hogan
the
eighth
circuit
addressed
that
issue,
your
honor,
in
their...
in
the...
in
the
decision
on
appeal
and
in
denying
the...
the
request
for
rehearing.
and
i...
i
should
point
out
that
marley
strenuously
disagrees
that
there
is
any
circumstantial
evidence
here.

what

has
been
fully
resolved
by

also
applied
the...
the
correct
standard

everything
about
the

decision
was
correct,
including
its
application
of

that
we
did
not
cite
