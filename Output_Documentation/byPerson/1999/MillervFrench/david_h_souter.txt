justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your...
your
proposition
that
started
this
discussion,
that
somehow
it's
relevant
that
these
decrees
are
at
least
4
years
old?
and
for
constitutional
purposes,
i
don't
know...
4
years
old
i
guess.
for
constitutional
purposes,
i
don't
know
why
that
is
relevant.
don't
we
make
the...
don't
we
have
to
operate
on
the
presumption
that
an
order
in
equity,
which
is
outstanding,
is
in
fact
an
appropriate
order
until
a
contrary
adjudication
has
been
determined?
and
isn't
that
presumption
just
as
good
for
a
4-year
order
as
a
4-month
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
don't
want
to
be
picky
about
your
form.
i
recognize
that.
but
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
don't...
don't
we
have
a
presumption
of
validity
which
is
just
as
good
for
4-year
as
for
4-month
or
4-day
orders?
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
could
pass
a
statute,
for
example,
saying
all
decrees
of...
of
a
court
of
otherwise
competent
jurisdiction
are
presumed
to
be
invalid?
justice
david
h.
souter
unnecessary?
could
congress
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the...
the
point
that
you
referred
to
were
not,
we'll
say,
90
days?
let's
assume
it
was
2
years.
everything
else
is...
is
the
same
in
the
statute
except
there's
a
2-year
grace
period
following
a...
a
request
for
termination.
would
you
find
a
constitutional
question
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
also
be
giving
what
i
think
most
of
us
would
assume
would
be
an
adequate
opportunity--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
review
the
continuing
necessity
for
even
a
very
complicated
decree.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you
could
say
in...
in
the
2-year
example,
that...
that
it
was
in
fact
operating
simply
as
a
rule
for
default
of...
of
a
perfectly
appropriate
judicial
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
was
going
to
say,
so
it
boils
down
to
a
question
of
time
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
fact
question.
and...
and
i
think
we
all...
i
mean,
justice
breyer
suggested
i
think
a
moment
ago
and
we
would...
i
imagine
you
would
agree
that
there
are
going
to
be
some
decrees
covered
by
the
statute
in
which
90
days
will
be
entirely
adequate
for
the
kind
of
review,
and
probably
they're
going
to
be
some
in...
in
which
it
would
not
be.
but
it...
it
comes...
it
boils
down
to
a
question
of
time
in
each
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
true.
but
in
the
2-year
example,
assuming
the
court
just
fools
around,
we
would
not
find
it
a...
a...
i
take
it
you
would
not
find
it
a
separation
of
powers
violation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
court
is
simply
inactive.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
if
congress...
if...
take
the
2-year
example
again.
i
think
we
would
probably
read
the
statute
as...
as
including
the
following
mandate
from
congress
to
the
judicial
system.
it
is
now
the
law
of
remedies
for
a
court
sitting...
federal
court
sitting
in
equity,
remedying
constitutional
violations,
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
a
current
review
mechanism
so
that
decrees
do
not
run
on
unnecessarily.
anything
unconstitutional
about
that
per
se?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
we're
also
assuming
in
the
2-year
example
that...
that
congress,
in...
in
changing
the
law
of
remedies,
gives
a
court
an
adequate
time
to
engage
in
the
review.
we...
we
assume
2
years
would
give
them
time
to
review
any
decree.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
take
it
it
would
follow
on...
on
your
own
argument
that
there
would
not
be
a
separation
of
powers
problem
in
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
at...
at
the
end
of
the
2
years,
congress,
in
effect,
is
saying,
if
you,
court,
do
not
engage
in
a
review
for
current
necessity,
which
we're
giving
you
plenty
of
time,
2
years,
to
do,
then
there
will
be
a
default
rule.
it
will
be
suspended
until
you
get
busy.
and
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
under
those
circumstances,
2
years,
adequate
time,
change
in
law
of
remedies,
the
default
rule
would
be
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers?
