but
it's
part
of
the
judgment
too.
that's
what
the
judgment
is.
it
includes
the
injunction,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
never
heard
of
this
suggested
distinction
between
remedy
and
judgment
if
the
remedy
is
part
of
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
doesn't
really
answer
justice
o'connor's
problem
because
if
your
reading
is
correct,
after
30
days,
they
could
put
six
people
in
each
cell,
even
though
they
only
had
two
during
the
4-year
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
my
point.
so,
they
could
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
until
they
get
that
provision
back,
the
state
could
legally
say,
we'll
put
the
six
people
back
in
the
shell...
in
the...
in
the
cell
until
we
get
the
litigation
resolved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
might
not
do
it,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
think
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
point
would
be
that
six
people
may...
say
they
put
three
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
would
argue
two
was
a
broader
remedy
than
necessary.
three
would
have
done
it.
so,
they
go
ahead
and
put
three
in,
and
then
they...
they...
but
they
surely
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
fight
about
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there's
an
argument
about
it.
my
point
is
the
guards
would
have
a...
a
good
faith
defense.
they
thought
three
was
okay.
do
you...
you
would
have
to
litigate
out
whether
or
not
it
was
unconstitutional
before
you'd
know
the
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
