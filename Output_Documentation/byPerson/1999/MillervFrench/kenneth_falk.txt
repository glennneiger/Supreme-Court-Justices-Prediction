mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
3626(e),
as
interpreted
by
the
seventh
circuit,
congress
imposes
an
automatic
stay
on
a
final
judgment
which
cannot
in
any
way
be
modified.
this
is
a
legislative
suspension
of
a
final
judgment.
this
does--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--of
course,
that
is
correct.
and...
and
wheeling
bridge
is,
at
least
the
initial
case,
that
talked
about
that.
and
in
wheeling
bridge,
this
court's
holding
was
that
if
congress
produces
new
substantive
law
which
modifies
the
substantive
law
upon
which
the
prospective
relief
is
modified...
is
based,
then
the
prospective
relief
can
be
modified.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
new
substantive
law.
it
is
merely
congress
saying
at
a
point
certain
we
are
requiring
that
this
stay
be
entered.
and
really--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
i
think
there
would
still
be
a
question
under
plaut
because
you
would
still
be
taking
a
final
judgment
at
some
point
and
saying...
congress
stepping
in
and
saying,
we
are
modifying
it.
however--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--exactly.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
yes,
and
if
you...
and
we
view...
we
view
the
separation
of
powers
as
a
functional
test,
is
congress
invading
the
central
prerogative
of
the
courts.
if
congress
gives
a
court
an
unreasonably
short
deadline,
a
deadline
which
in
some
cases
cannot
be
met,
then
obviously
that
is
an
invasion
because
after
that--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--well,
yes,
it
does,
but
it
also
boils
down--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--well,
that's
correct.
however,
what
the
passage
of
time
affects,
what
happens
after
the
end
of
that
period
is
congress
stepping
in,
without
having
any
new
law,
without--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--i
think--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--i
think
it
will
be
much
more
problematic.
on
the
other
hand,
i
also--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
don't
think
the
change
of
time
is
relevant,
as
i
said,
under
plaut.
if
congress
today--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--and
i
think...
i
think
obviously
the
more
time
congress
gives,
the
less
chance
there
is
there
are
going
to
be
problems
and
the
more
we're
going
to
want
to
give
congress
that
limited
ability
to
enter
into--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--there
is--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--that's
correct.
there's
a
plaut
problem
with
the
statute
no
matter
how
much
time
is
given,
but...
but
from
a
general--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--no.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
yes.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
well,
it
depends
what
happens
after
the
2
years.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
if
it
is
applied
retroactively
to
existing
judgments,
yes.
and
i
think
we're
back
to
plaut.
the
question
there
is
can
congress
reach
in
to
a
final
judgment
in
the
prospective
equity
sense
without
providing
new
law.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
yes.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
well,
they
are
revisable
with
new
law.
and
in
fact,
if...
if
we
look
at
the
historical--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--but...
but
still,
if
we
look
at
plaut,
there
was
a
concern
of
this
court's
opinion
in
plaut
of
what
was
happening
at
the
time,
both
before
and
after
the
passage
of
the
constitution,
with
state
legislatures
sitting
as
super
courts
either
directly
reviewing
judgments
or
passing
legislation.
some
of
those
cases,
at
least
as
pointed
out
by
the
amicus
in
the...
the
taylor
amicus
at
page
5
of
their
brief,
concerned
cases
in
equity.
if
there
is
an
injunction--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--because
if
congress
says
to
a
court,
you
must
suspend
or
even
terminate
this
order,
period,
i
don't
think
congress
is
functioning
as
congress.
congress
is
functioning
from
a
separation
of
powers
standpoint
in
a
judicial
capacity.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
of
course,
it
can
and
that's
the
function
of
congress.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
but--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--but
(e)(2)
does
not
do
anything.
it
does
not
prescribe
the
remedial
power
of
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
sure.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
well,
that's
how
(b)(2)
works,
but
that's
not
how
(e)(2)
works.
(e)(2)
doesn't
look
to
future
standards.
(e)(2)
says
nothing
about
standards.
(e)(2)
says
no
matter
what
you
found,
no
matter
what
the
court
did,
no
matter
how
egregious--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--the
situation
was--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--i'm
sorry.
is
the
question
whether--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--no,
but
we
do
not
feel
that
the
statute
is
that
pliable.
we
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
circumscribe
the
district
court's
discretion
as
greatly
as
possible.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
well,
the
1995
conference
report
discusses
the
fact
that
this
was
designed
to
make
judges
rule
more
promptly.
now,
that--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--but
the
legislative
history
i
believe...
and
there's
not
a...
there's
not
a
lot
of
legislative
history,
but
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
examples
brought
by
prison
officials
and
by
representatives
themselves
of
what
they
deem
to
be
improper
interference
by
courts.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
but
again,
given
that...
given
that
legislative
history
and
given
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
the
larger
sense
is
to
circumscribe
the
discretion
of
these
courts,
which
congress
clearly
from
the
legislative
history
felt
was
running
amuck
in
some
sense,
it
would--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
and...
and
from
a
substantive
standpoint,
this
is
a
unique
situation,
which
i
believe
you
pointed
out,
which
is
that
the
result
of
this
automatic
stay
is
to
let
the
moving
party
basically
win
their
case.
after...
after
30
or
90
days,
the
state
will
get
everything
it
is
ultimately
going
to
be
asking
for.
it's
going
to
be
getting
a
suspension
which
is,
in
effect,
a
termination
of
all
that
really...
and
that...
that's
the
uniqueness.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
i
do
not
think
congress
could
pass
that
law
with
regard
to
judgments
that
have
already
been
entered.
i
think
that
would
be
purely
retroactive
in
the
plaut
sense.
you'd
be
imposing
a
new
ground
of
reopening
that
did
not
exist
when
the
judgment
went
into
effect.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
and
in
light
of
that,
we
think
this
is
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
under
plaut
because
congress
has
commanded
the
reopening
of
a
judgment
in
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers.
also
from
a
separation
of
powers
standpoint,
as
i
indicated,
this
statute
does
invade
the
central
prerogative
of
the
court,
the
ability
to
rule
and
decide
upon
cases
subject
only
to
review
by
superior
courts.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
no.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
no,
but
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--it
would
wipe
out
the
remedy
that
had
been
ordered.
i
mean,
(e)(2)
takes
the
judgment...
and
i
believe
the
judgment
includes
the
remedy...
and
it
wipes
out
all...
everything
according
to
the
definition
of
prospective
relief.
everything
with
the
exception
of
damages
is
prospective
relief.
so,
all
declarations
as
to
past
violations,
all
injunctions,
any
collateral
matters...
that
is
stayed.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
that's
correct.
and
then
we're
back
to
the
fact
that
90
days
is
admittedly
inadequate
time
in
some
situations
to
do
that.
so--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--no,
we
are
not
saying
that
at
all,
but
if
you
look
at
norris-laguardia
and
if
you
look
at
tros,
what
you're
dealing
with
there
is
congress
saying
we're
giving
you
5
days,
10
days,
whatever,
after
which
you,
court...
the
temporary
order,
the
ex
parte
order,
whatever
goes
away,
but
you,
court,
you
can
still
function
as
a
court.
you
can
enter
a
preliminary
injunction.
you
can
do
something.
here
not
only
is
congress
saying
to
the
courts,
after
90
days,
you...
we...
we
step
in.
we're
going
to
make
the
decision,
but--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--well,
but
even
in
the
context
of
norris-laguardia
or
temporary
restraining
orders,
congress
still
gives
the
court
the
power
to
act
as
a
court.
there
are
deadlines.
if
they
are--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--of
course.
and
the...
the
unique
thing
about
(e)(2),
if
you
look
at
the
10-day
limit,
for
instance,
a...
on
a
tro,
under
(e)(2)
the
analogy
would
be
after
10
days
the
plaintiff
would
win
and
would
not...
and
the
court
would
not
be
able
to
stop
that.
that's
exactly
what
happens
here.
after
90
days--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
i'm
sorry.
after
90
days,
the
state
wins
and
the
court
then
cannot
do
anything
to
alter
that
fact
until
they
have
their
final
hearing.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--to
the
extent...
yes,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
acting
retroactively.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
i
still
think
we
have
to
operate
within
the
intent
of
congress,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
language
is
explicit,
which
it's
not,
or
whether
there's
inescapable
inference
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
this...
the
court
having
this
power.
and
i
believe
there
is,
as
did
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
i
believe
if
we
put
that
in
context,
yes.
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
kenneth
j.
falk
--but
again,
congress
clearly
felt
that
the
courts
were
not...
any
of
the
courts,
whether
the
district
courts
or
the
courts
of
appeals,
were
not
controlling
themselves,
which
is
why
we
have
such
extreme
limitations
in
the
plra.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
think
the
seventh
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
