justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
had
no
interest
in
having
the
case
mooted,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
have
been
the
situation
i
suppose
if
the
district
court
had
proceeded--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and...
and
had
given
you
what
you
wanted.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
judgment
say?
the
judgment
says
that
the
state
was
in
violation.
right?
and
the
rest
is
remediation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
prescribes
to
remedy
that
violation
is...
is
not...
is
not
part
of
the
judgment.
it's
part
of
the
remedy
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but
you
say...
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the...
you
say
that
the...
if
you
agree
with
that,
then...
then
you
must
retract
your
assertion
that...
that
congress
can,
in
fact,
change
the
remedies
that
are
available
for
the
future.
in
the
case
of...
of
an
injunction
that
operates
prospectively,
your
position
is
that
congress
has
the
power
to
change
the
ability
of
the
court
to
impose
certain
remedies
in
the
future,
so
long
as
congress
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
it
can't
be
part
of
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
mr.
laramore,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
you
have
to
establish
the
initial
proposition
that
constitutional
issues
aside,
which
congress
lets
the
court
resolve
during
that
90-day
period...
constitutional
issues
aside,
congress
has
the
power
to
eliminate
a
remedy
that
has
been
prospectively
imposed
by
a
court.
let
me
pose
a
simple
example
that
doesn't
contain
a
constitutional
problem.
suppose
congress
passes
a
law
that
says
that
federal
courts
will
not
have
authority
to
impose
injunctions
against
competition
in
any
cases
under
federal
statutes
alleging
violation
of
some...
some
business...
business
rights,
that
in
the
future,
federal
courts
will
not
have
the
power
to
enjoin
competition.
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
statute
specifically
says,
any
injunctions
already
in
effect,
enjoining
competition
for
the
future,
will
be
dissolved.
is
that
law
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
come
on.
answer
the
hard
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it
has
the
power
to
give
the
courts
90
days
and
say,
if
you
don't
do
it
in
90
days,
they're
no
longer
invalid
unless
it
has
the
power
to
invalidate
them.
period.
that's...
that's
my...
that's
my
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
not
willing
to
say
that
it
has
the
power
to
invalidate
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
they
couldn't
do
that.
i
mean,
they
couldn't
do
that.
that
would...
if
that
was
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
unlawful,
just
as
it
would
be
unlawful
if
the
injunction
remained
in
effect
to
disobey
the
injunction.
you're
really
just
talking
about
whether
you're
going
to
have
two
laws
prohibiting
this
unlawful
action
or
just
one
law
prohibiting
this
unlawful
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
none
of...
none
of
these
other
examples
that
you
allude
to
were
enacted
for
the
very
purpose
of
inducing
the
court
to
which
the
stay
applied
to
act
quickly.
none
of
those
examples
had
that
purpose
in
mind,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
bankruptcy
stay,
for
example.
the
purpose
of
it
isn't
to
hustle
the...
the
courts
that
have
litigation
pending
to...
to
get
the
litigation
out
of
the
way
quickly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
navigational
servitude?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know...
do
you
know...
do
you
know
any...
any
judicial
injunctions
just
like
this,
that
permanently
control
the
operation
of
an
entire
agency
of
state
government
indefinitely?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
extraordinary...
extraordinary
problems
may...
may
require
extraordinary
solutions.
i'm
unfamiliar
with
any
other
injunction
by
courts
that...
that
manage
an
entire
department
of
state
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
prisoners
in
the
cell,
how
many...
you
know,
what
food
they're
to
eat--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
access
to
libraries
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
those
laws
again,
like
the
other
stays
you
mentioned
earlier...
the
purpose
of
them
was...
was...
it
was
not
directed
against
the
anticipated
lassitude
of
the...
of
the
district
judge,
to
whom
you
want
to
give
this
power
to...
to
suspend
the
stay.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms....
ms.
laramore,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
i...
i
asked...
ms.
underwood,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
that
i
asked
mr.
laramore?
what
if
congress
passes
a
law
saying
that
a
particular
category
of
injunctions,
some
of
which
are
out
there
already,
is
no
longer
permissible
and
all
outstanding
injunctions
which...
which
violate
that
provision
are
dissolved?
the
example
i
gave
was
no
injunctions
against
competition.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
my
question
is
it
simply
says,
those
injunctions
shall
no
longer
be
effective.
it's
not
a
matter
of
any
standard
being
met.
this
is
no
longer
one
of
the
powers
we
give
courts
for
the
future
in
this
kind
of
case,
and
therefore,
for
the
future
in...
in
these
cases,
those
injunctions
are
no
longer
effective.
period.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
could
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
underwood,
are
we
talking
here
about
serious...
serious
problems?
i
mean,
don't
you
think
that
even
when
the
injunction
is
dissolved
after
90
days,
the
state
would
be
very
loathe
to
change
anything
set
forth
in
the
earlier
injunction
that
it
was
not
absolutely
sure
would
comport
with
the
new...
with
the
new
standard
set
forth
in
the
new
legislation?
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
and
therefore
unlawful
to
do
anything
that
would
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
prisoners,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
but
it
will
be...
the
state
will
be
at
risk
with
respect
to
that
difference
of
opinion
when
there...
when
there
is...
there
had
been
an
injunction
which
is
now
dissolved.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
more...
you're
talking
about
due
process
then,
not
separation
of
powers.
if...
if
the
change
in
time
is...
is
the
crux
for
you,
all
you're
talking
about
is
whether...
whether
congress
has
provided
enough
time
for
these
people
to
have
the
court
make
the
proper
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
but
that's
not
just
what
you
told
justice
souter.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
take
the
position...
if
you
don't
want
us
to
treat
this
as
a...
as
a
due
process,
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
even
if
it
was
10
years,
congress
simply
has
no
power
to
terminate
a
judicial
decree
without
a
change,
as
you
say,
in
the
substantive
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
back
again.
the
less
chance
there
will
be
due
process
problems,
but
the
chance
that
there
will
be
a...
a
separation
of
powers
problem
is
still
100
percent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--assuming
the
situation
arises.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but
they
didn't
make
distinctions
between...
between
new
legislation...
new
legislative
action
that
involve
what
you
call
substantive
law
and
new
legislative
action
that
alters
the
remedies
available
for
courts.
surely,
those...
that
prohibition
applied
to
both.
if
you're
dealing
non-prospectively,
certainly
it's
just
as...
just
as
bad
to...
to
change
the
law,
the
substantive
law,
as
it
is
to
change
the
remedial
law.
you
have
to
let
what...
what's
over
the
dam
be
over
the
dam.
but
once
you're
into
the
prospective
area,
why
should
there
be
a
distinction
between
a
change
in
substantive
law
and
a
change
in
the
remedies
that
the
court
is
allowed
to
impose
in
the
future?
i
don't
see
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it
can
change
the
substantive
law
and
say,
you...
you
may
not
enforce
this
decree
in
the
future
because
we're
changing...
we've
decided
we're
going
to
change
the
law
on
you,
that...
that
you...
that
was
the
basis
for
the
decree?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
you
say
of
course
for
the
one
and
not
of
course
for...
it's
also
the
function
of
congress...
just
as
it
is
to
enact
substantive
law,
it
is
a
function
of
congress
to
enact
laws
prescribing
the
remedial
powers
of
the
courts
within
constitutional
limits.
and
that's...
that's
not...
not
the
issue
here,
whether
this
is
within
the
constitutional
limits.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
fully
legitimate
legislative
power
of
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
wrong
with
that?
i
mean,
don't
you
think
congress
could
pass
a
statute...
let's
take
an
extreme
one...
saying
no
injunction
shall
issue
for
more
than
a
year?
after
a
year,
if...
if
the
situation
is...
is
not
totally
resolved,
you
go
back
to
square
one
and
have
to
bring
another
lawsuit
and
establish
a
violation
all
over
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that...
that
would
be
your
position.
well,
i...
i
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
falk,
i
come
back
to
your...
your
objection.
the
telecommunications
policy
of
the
united
states
was
largely
directed
by
the...
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
about
25
or
30
years
under
a
consent
decree
entered
into
by
at&t.
do
you
really
think
that
congress
did
not
have
the
power
to
simply
say,
we
do
not
want
our
national
telecommunications
policy
directed
by
judicial...
by
judicial
injunction
for
the
future,
and
henceforward,
this...
this
decree
shall
have
no
force
and
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
thing
congress
could
do
in
that
situation
was
to
amend
the
substantive
telecommunications
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
extraordinary.
