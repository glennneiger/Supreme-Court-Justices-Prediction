mr.
jon
laramore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
addresses
the
automatic
stay
provision
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
the
full
text
of
the
united
states
code
section
may
be
found
at
page
1
of
the
appendix
to
our
certiorari
petition.
the
automatic
stay
is
designed
to
effectuate
other
provisions
of
the
plra--
mr.
jon
laramore
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
laramore
the
case...
there
was
no
action
on
the
motion
to
vacate
during
the
entire
time
the
appeal
pended
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
once
the
appeal
was
concluded
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
district
court
judge--
mr.
jon
laramore
--well,
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
the
district
court,
though,
did
not
set
a
hearing
on
the
motion--
mr.
jon
laramore
--until
after
the
appeal
was...
was
completed.
that
hearing
date
was
then...
the
initial
hearing
was
set...
the
hearing
was
initially
set
for
last
december,
and
it's
now
been
extended
until
june
of
this
year.
mr.
jon
laramore
our...
our
appeal
was
pending
at
that
point
in...
on
the
merits
of
the
automatic
stay
issue,
and
we
chose
not
to
go
the
mandamus
route
given
how
procedurally
complex
that
would
have
made
the
case
at
that
point.
mr.
jon
laramore
we
did
not
formally
make
that
request
of
the
district
court.
mr.
jon
laramore
well,
that's
right,
and
we...
it
was
our
understanding
that
the
district
court...
without
it
having
made
a
formal
request,
that
the
district
court
wanted
to
wait
until
the
appeal
was
concluded.
mr.
jon
laramore
well,
we
are
interested
in--
mr.
jon
laramore
--that
would
have
perhaps
mooted
this
case--
mr.
jon
laramore
--that
would
have
perhaps
mooted
this
automatic
stay
issue,
although
perhaps
not
under
the
doctrine
of
capability
of
repetition
but
evading
review.
at
any
rate,
the
automatic
stay
is
designed
to
give
district
courts
incentives
to
move
quickly
on
motions
to
terminate
injunctions
in
prison
cases.
the
seventh
circuit
invalidated
the
automatic
stay,
found
it
violating...
found
it
to
violate
separation
of
powers
concepts.
but
the
automatic
stay
is
constitutional
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
automatic
stay
does
not
affect
the
underlying
judgment.
it
merely
addresses
in
a
temporary
way
district
courts'
prospective
equitable
power,
and
it
only
does
so
after
the
district
court
already
has
had
90
days
to
act
on
the
motion
to
vacate
or
the
motion
to
terminate.
mr.
jon
laramore
it
is
correct
that
the
injunction
only
continues
if
the
district
court
finds
that
it's
necessary
to
correct
an
ongoing
constitutional
violation.
so,
you're
correct
in
that
sense.
and...
and
the
point
i'm
making
is
a...
a
formalistic
point
in
a
sense
that
it's...
that
the
judgment
is
not...
that
the
automatic
stay
does
not
act
directly
on
the
judgment,
but
acts
only
on
the
district
court's
prospective
equitable
powers.
it
does
mean
that
the
prisoners
are
not
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
injunctive
portion
of
any
existing
order
during
the
period
of
the
suspension.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
it
is
part
of
the
remedy,
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
well,
it
certainly--
mr.
jon
laramore
--and
certainly
this
statute
is
aimed
at
dealing
with
the
remedial
portions
of...
of--
mr.
jon
laramore
--however
we
describe
it.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
i'm
not
sure
that
i
precisely
agree
with
what
you
said.
congress
can
direct
the
judicial
branch
to
reexamine
the
judgment
itself
and...
and
impose
upon
it
new
standards
such
as
the
standards
that
are
in
part
(b)
of
this...
of
this
portion
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
what
the
automatic
stay
does
doesn't
direct
the
judicial
branch
to
do
anything.
it
has...
it
causes
the
motion
to
vacate
itself
to
act
automatically
as
a
stay
of
the
injunctive
portions
of
the
judgment
prospectively.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes,
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
and...
and--
mr.
jon
laramore
--justice
o'connor,
i...
i
think
i
would
describe
our
position
somewhat
differently
than
that.
we
say
that
it's
appropriate
for
congress
to...
to
change
the
remedial
law
as
it
has
done
here
and
to
require
the
courts
to
apply
the
changed
remedial
law
to
existing
decrees.
and
how
that
would
apply
in...
in
the
case
that
you
describe
is
that
the
state
would
make
a
motion
and
it
would
say,
we
no
longer
need
to
have
this
injunction
that
says
we
can
only
have
two
people
in
a
cell
and...
and
2,000
calories--
mr.
jon
laramore
--right.
mr.
jon
laramore
and
that
shifts
the
burden.
that's
where
the
substantive
change
has
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
jon
laramore
no.
i
certainly
didn't
avoid
that
on
purpose.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
and...
and,
of
course,
this
is
a
prospective
statute
in
that
it
applies
to
any
decrees
entered
in
the
future
as...
and...
and
congress
has
also
set
up
the
mechanism
to
apply
the
same
standards
to
decrees
that
are
already
in
existence--
mr.
jon
laramore
--yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
plainly
i
think
the
prospective
portion
of
it
applying
to
injunctions
not
yet
issued
is
valid.
mr.
jon
laramore
and
then
the
question
i
think
becomes--
mr.
jon
laramore
--a
formalistic
one
whether...
whether
congress
may
pass
a
law
that
says
those
injunctions
are
no
longer
valid
as...
as
it
did
in
the
telecommunications
act
as
to
some
of
the
existing
injunctions,
or
whether
it
must
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
which
is
to
say,
courts
must
evaluate
those
injunctions
and
apply
the
new
standards
to
those
injunctions
but--
mr.
jon
laramore
--well--
mr.
jon
laramore
--it
has
the
power
to
tell
the...
and
again,
this
is...
is
perhaps
too
technical
a
way
to
express
it.
but
it
has
the
power
to
tell
the
district
courts
that
they
can
no
longer
enforce
those
injunctions,
which
may
be
the
same
as
invalidating
the
injunctions.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes,
as
a
matter
of
separation
of
powers.
mr.
jon
laramore
well,
judge
easterbrook
says
in...
in
his
dissent
that
there
may
be
a
due
process
element
involved
here,
although
i
suggest
that
that
is
not
such
an
issue
here
as
long
as
there
are
other
methods
that
prisoners
can
use
outside
of
this
injunctive--
mr.
jon
laramore
--to
vindicate
their
rights.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
there's
no
other
statute
that
we've
found
that
acts
in
that
way
on
an
existing
judgment.
mr.
jon
laramore
there
are,
of
course,
other
provisions
with
time
limits
that
have
consequences
such
as
the
speedy
trial
act
and
pre-trial
detention--
mr.
jon
laramore
--yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
but
i
do
want
to
highlight
two
portions
of
the
statute
that
seem
to
be
missing
from
the
example
that...
that
you've
given
and
that
justice
o'connor
maybe
began.
two
things.
one
is
that
this
statute
only
applies
at
this
point
to
injunctions
that
are
quite
old.
all
of
them
must
be
now
at
least
4
years
old
because
that's
how
old
the
act
is.
so,
we're
talking
about
situations
where
there
has
already
been
a
judgment
in
place
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
we
would
expect
that
either
the
prison
has
conformed
its
conduct
to
the
constitution
at
this
point
or
the
prisoners
would
be
back
in
court
seeking
enforcement,
seeking
contempt
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
jon
laramore
well,
they
could.
mr.
jon
laramore
there
would
be
no
injunction
prohibiting
it,
but--
mr.
jon
laramore
--they
could
do
it.
but,
of
course,
then
the
prisoners
at
that
point
can
use
the
provisions
of
3626(b)(3)
and
get
their
permanent
injunction
back
at
that
point.
they
could
also
use
the
temporary
injunction
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes,
but
let
me
point
out
one
other--
mr.
jon
laramore
--but
one...
one
other
thing
about
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
standard
of
conduct
is
set
in
that
judgment
and
that
standard
of
conduct
remains
because
the
automatic
stay
doesn't
erase
the
judgment.
so,
if...
if
the
state
went
ahead
and
put
six
people
in
the
cell,
that...
there
would...
there
could
be
a
damages
action
by
those
prisoners
against
prison
officials
in
their
individual
capacities
and
qualified
immunity
would
certainly
not
apply
because
the
state
has
already
said
that
six
people
in
the
cell
is
unconstitutional.
so...
so,
there's
that
incentive
on
the
state
as
well.
mr.
jon
laramore
that's--
mr.
jon
laramore
--well,
i...
i
understand
the
question,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
don't
think
that
that...
that
those
requirements
for
narrowness
and
least
intrusiveness
go
to
the
substantive
constitutional
finding
that
six
people
in
a
cell
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes,
they
could
do
that.
mr.
jon
laramore
and
that
could
be
the
subject
of
later
litigation,
but...
but
that's--
mr.
jon
laramore
--well,
that's...
that's
right.
mr.
jon
laramore
yes,
and
i
answered
justice
stevens'
question
the
way
i
did
with
the
understanding
that
three
in
a
cell
had
not
been
adjudicated--
mr.
jon
laramore
--that's
correct.
mr.
jon
laramore
in
passing
these
portions
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
congress
was
addressing
a
problem
that
it
perceived
which
was--
mr.
jon
laramore
--i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
that's
a
question
of
substantive
law
that
congress
could
alter.
congress
could,
for
example--
mr.
jon
laramore
--well--
mr.
jon
laramore
--congress
i
think
could
go
so
far
as
to
say
in
a
prospective
manner
that
injunctions
in
prison
cases,
for
example,
would
expire
after
a
particular
period
of
time--
mr.
jon
laramore
--unless
the
contrary
showing
was
made.
