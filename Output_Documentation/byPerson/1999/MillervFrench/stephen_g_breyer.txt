justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
didn't
you
ask
for
mandamus?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
to
go
back
a
minute
to
your
statutory
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
really
wanted
to
hear
the
other
side
on
this,
but
i
might...
i
mean,
the...
the...
you...
you
point
out,
i
think
correctly,
that
the
operating
language...
it's
the
words,
shall
operate
as
a
stay.
those
are
identical
to
the
words
in
the
bankruptcy
statute.
it
says,
operates
as
a
stay.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
as
you
point
out,
that
suggests
it
shouldn't
operate
like
any
other
stay.
and
there's
lots
that
suggest
it
should.
but
there
is
the
problem
of
purpose,
and
in
terms
of
purpose,
i'd
like
to
know
the
following.
i'm
familiar
with
one
prison
decree
in
puerto
rico.
that
was
20
judicial
opinions,
20
years,
10
institutions,
health,
mental
health,
overcrowding
four
or
five
times
the...
the
proper
number
in
a
cell,
et
cetera,
70
million
dollars
in
fines,
special
masters,
complicated
beyond
belief.
i
don't
believe
it's
conceivable
that
you
could
deal
with
something
like
that
in
90
days.
now,
at
the
other
extreme,
there
are
ones
you
probably
could.
you've
looked
into
them.
is
my
characterization
of
puerto
rico
correct,
and
if
so,
are
there
others
that
just
couldn't
be
done
in
90
days?
i
mean,
is...
if
that's
a
big
problem,
then
i
would
think
probably
congress
didn't
want
to
clear
them
up
in
90
days,
but
just
wanted
to
speed
things
up.
if
it's
not
a
big
problem,
it
becomes
more
plausible
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
end
everything
in
90
days.
so,
empirically
what
are
we
dealing
with?
are
we
dealing
with
a
world
where
it's
very
unlikely
congress,
which
is
not...
which
we
assume...
and
it
does
normally
do
things
that
are
reasonable...
doesn't
want
to
ask
district
judges
to
do
the
impossible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
the
commonwealth
has
paid
68
million
dollars
rather
than
comply,
you
think
they
suddenly
will
comply
when
there's
no...
when
there's
no
decree
in
effect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
did.
i
thought
that
the...
my
understanding
of
this...
and
i'd
like
you
to
clarify--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
congress
introduced
a
new
standard
for
all
cases,
and...
or
they
thought
it
was
new.
the
standard
would
be
that
you
can't
go...
you
have
to
be
narrowly
tailored--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
can't
go
beyond
the...
and
it
say
that...
you
can't
go
beyond
the
federal
right
that's
infringed.
and...
and
it
said,
that
applies
to
every
new
case
that's
ever
going
to
be
brought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
also
applies
to
those
in
the
old
cases,
but
only
in
the
future.
and
now
what
we
do
is
we
have
a
2-year
period
or
a
10-month
period
or
a
90-day
period
where,
as
we
look
at
the
prospective
relief
and
bring
it
into
conformity
with
the
standard
that's
going
to
apply
in
the
future
for
everybody.
now,
is
that...
is
that
how
it
works?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
but
now...
that's...
that's
the
automatic
stay,
of
course,
which
is
the
substance
here,
the
issue.
but
i
was
speaking
in
generally
and
in
terms
of
the
substance
of
the...
in
terms
of
the
substance
of
the
thing,
how
quickly
you
have
to
decide.
is
there
any
constitutional
objection,
do
you
think,
if
you
were
to
interpret
those
words,
shall
operate
as
an
automatic
stay,
like
any
other
automatic
stay
and
say
that's
subject
to
termination
for
good
cause
and
with
the
burden
shifted
the
other
way,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
you
adopt
the
sg's
interpretation
of
the
words,
shall
operate
as
an
automatic
stay,
then
in
your
opinion
is
there
still
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
that
pliable?
what
they
said...
they
used
the
same
words
as
any
other
statute.
they
have
a
set
of
appeals
provisions
that...
that
really
don't
make
much
sense
unless
you
interpret
it
their
way,
and
in
addition,
you
have
to
assume
an
intent
of
congress
that
they
were
asking
at
least
some
district
judges
to
perform
the
impossible.
so...
so,
why...
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
interpretation
of
words
that
don't
demand
a
contrary
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's...
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
the
sg's
interpretation,
which
is
consistent
with
the
language,
is
not
what
congress
intended?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
more...
absolutely.
this
shifts
the
burden.
you
have
mandamus.
you
couldn't
delay
3
years.
you'd
have
to
get
this
thing
decided
quickly,
but
you
wouldn't
be
asking
them
to
do
what
is
impossible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
and...
and
where
that
would
be
taking
place,
you
would
have
an
automatic
stay.
it
could
be
set
aside
only
for
cause.
you
would
have
mandamus
if
the
judge
doesn't
decide
quickly,
and
you
would
have
an
immediate
appeal.
all
right.
so,
we
would
cure
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
finish
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
what
do
you
say
about
the
canon
of...
avoid
a
difficult
constitutional
question,
interpret
the
statute?
isn't
it
made
for
your
argument?
that
is
to
say,
wouldn't
you
if
you
were
a
congressman
prefer
an
interpretation
that
gave
you
98
percent
of
what
you
wanted
rather
than
one
that
gave
you
0
percent
because
it
was
perfect?
i
mean,
in
other
words,
the
100
percent
is
struck
down
and
they
get
nothing.
so,
isn't
that
what
that
canon
is
there
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
thing
i
should
read
to
make
sure
there's
that
inescapable
inference
is
the
horror
stories
about
judges
out
of
control?
is
that
the
one
that
i
should--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
then
we
control
them
and
that's
the
mandamus
and
so
forth.
