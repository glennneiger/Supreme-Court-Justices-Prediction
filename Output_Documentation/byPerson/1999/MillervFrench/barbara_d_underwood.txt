ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
the
rule
that
it
takes
a
clear
statement
to
deprive
a
court
of
its
traditional
equitable
powers,
the
plra's
automatic
stay,
3626(e)(2),
does
not
remove
a
court's
traditional
equitable
power
to
prevent
irreparable
harm
while
an
action
is
pending.
when
prison
officials
move
under
the
plra
to
terminate
prospective
relief,
the
(e)(2)
stay
comes
into
effect
in
the
ordinary
case
if
the
termination
motion
can't
be
resolved
in
30
or,
on
extension,
90
days.
but
nothing
in
the
statute
purports
to
strip
a
court
of
its
power
to
grant
extraordinary
interim
relief
to
either
party
if
it
finds
the
party
is
likely
to
succeed
on
the
merits
and
will
otherwise
suffer
irreparable
harm,
but
it
will
take
more
than
90
days
to
decide
the
motion.
and
construing
the
statute
to
take
away
that
power,
of
course,
would
raise
the
serious
constitutional
question
about
the
power
of
congress
to
suspend
a
final
judgment
of
an
article
iii
court
without
giving
the
court
any
role
in
the
process.
several
features
of
the
statute
support
this
interpretation.
first,
the
words,
automatic
stay
and
the
motion
shall
operate
as
a
stay,
are
commonly
used
to
describe
a
default
rule
for
the
normal
case,
the
rule
that
governs
unless
a
court
decides
otherwise,
not
a
rule
that
courts
can't
change.
there
are
other
automatic
stays
in
the
law.
the
bankruptcy
stay
was
apparently
the
model
for
this.
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
establish
an
automatic
10-day
stay
of
judgment
in
many
cases,
and
as
one
senator
noticed
in
discussing
this
provision,
it's
common
under
state
law
for
the
state
to
get
an
automatic
stay
pending
a
government
appeal.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
i
think
that's
right.
i'm
simply
pointing
that
the...
to
the
fact
that
the
use
of
the
language,
automatic
stay,
or
the
term,
a
motion
shall
operate
a
stay,
is
conventional
legislative
usage.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
there
is
a...
a
serious
constitutional
question.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
while
we
think
it's
difficult,
on
balance,
as
we've
said
in
our...
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
it
can
be
constitutionally
defended
because
it
operates
only
on
prospective
relief
and
this
court's
precedents
permit
a
change
in
law
to
affect
prospective
relief
even
in
what
is
otherwise
a
final
decree,
an
injunctive
decree,
and
because
it
doesn't--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
wheeling
bridge
is
an...
is
the
sort
of
the
classic
example
of
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
final
decree
prohibiting...
initially
requiring
the
taking
down
of
the
bridge,
and
then
it
would
have
been...
would...
prohibited
its...
its
rebuilding.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i'm
not
sure
i
would
call
it
a
navigational
servitude.
there...
there
had
been
a
determination
that
the
bridge
obstructed
commerce,
interfered
with
interstate
commerce,
and
congress
decided
in
fact
it
advanced
commerce
rather
than
interfering
with
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was
a
right
of
the
united
states.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
this
is
like
the...
the
sioux
nation
situation,
for
instance,
in
which
the
government
is
actually
giving
up
its
own
right.
it
changed
the
regulatory
regime
about
the
relationship
of
bridges
to
navigation
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
way
it
operated
in...
in
that
case
on
behalf
of
private
parties.
and
it
was
then
appropriate
for
the
injunction...
for
the...
for
the
prospective
relief
to
take
account
of
the
change
in
the
law.
it's
also
the
case,
although
this
wouldn't
be
legislative,
that...
that
the
modification
of
the
decree
in
rufo
was...
meant
to
take...
was
appropriate
to
take
account
of...
of
changes
in
law
and...
and
this
court's
decision
in
agostini
reflected
the
appropriateness
of
modifying
prospective
relief
to
take
account
of
changes
in
law.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
don't
know
any
statute
that
operates
that
way
either,
and
that's
why
we
think
this
is
a
difficult
constitutional
question.
there
is
no
statute
just
like
this.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
they
don't--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
don't
know
that
this
manages
an
entire
department
of
state
government,
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--and
even
before
the
plra,
there
was
available
a
motion
to
modify
under...
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
this
prescribes
new
standards
and
a
new
procedure
for
dealing
with
it,
but
the
court...
but...
but
it's
not
a
new
problem
that
injunctions
may
require
modification
to
deal
with
changing
circumstances.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
congress
did
treat
it
as
a
special
case.
and
the
question
is
whether
in
doing
so
and
taking
the
court
out
of
the
process,
not
only
modifying
the
rules
and
modifying
the...
the
remedy,
but
doing
so
without
the
intervention
of
a
court,
congress
has
crossed
a
constitutional
line.
there...
there
is
no
precedent
that
i
know
of
for
it,
and
that's...
and
we
urge
that
the
statute
be
construed
not
to
do
that
not
only
because
of
the
constitutional
principle
but
also
because
this
court's
precedents
consistently
say
that
courts
should
not
be...
that
congress
should
not
be
read
to
have
taken
away
a
court's
equitable--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--powers.
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--in
scripps-howard,
the
court...
there
was
a
statute
that
provided
for
stays
pending
appeal
of
certain
fcc
orders
and
not
for
others,
and
this
court
held
that
the
appellate
court
still
had
its
traditional
power
to
grant
stays
in
the
second
class
of
cases,
the
class
that
the
statute
didn't
authorize
stays
for.
and
in
honig,
a
statute
provided
that
during
the
dispute
over
the
placement
of
a
disabled
child,
the
child
shall
remain
in
the
then
current
placement
during
the
proceedings.
this
court
called
it
an
automatic
injunction,
rather
like
the
automatic
stay
in
this
statute.
and
yet,
the
court
held
that
the
district
court
still
had
its
traditional
equitable
power
to
lift
that
automatic
injunction
and
make
its
own
determination
about
the
equitable
needs
for
interim
relief
while
the
matter
was
pending.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
court
has...
the
congress
has
provided
another
mechanism
for
expediting
review
that
was
discussed
earlier;
that
is
to
say,
it
specifically
directed
the
district
court
to
decide
promptly
and
authorize
mandamus
for
a
failure
to
decide
promptly.
i
don't
think
that
it
follows
from
that
that
it
also
intended
during
what
might
be
a
short
time
or
it
might
be
a
long
time,
but
would
be
a
time
beyond
the
90
days
provided
by
the
statute,
that
if
it
took
longer
than
that
to
resolve
the
matter,
that
constitutionally...
relief
that
had
been
ordered
by
a
court
for
a
constitutional
violation
and
whose
termination
might
cause
irreparable
injury...
and
we're
talking
now...
if
we're
talking
about
standard
equitable
powers,
we're
also
taking
about
a
determination
that
at
least
the
prisoners
have
a
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
the
court
might
not
be
prepared
to
find
that
there
should
be
no
termination,
that
the
motion
should
continue,
but
it
would
have
to
find,
for
injunctive
relief,
that
they
had
a
probability
of
success
on
the
merits
and
that
lifting
the...
the
existing
decree
would
threaten
irreparable
harm.
it
would
make
a
judgment
about
the
balance
of
harms,
that
in
that
case
congress
intended
essentially
to
cause
irreparable
injury.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
if
you...
and
if
you
take
out
the
question
whether
the
constitution--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--might
independently
require
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that
injunction,
i
think
congress
has
the
power
to
alter
the
law
of
remedies
that
is
applicable.
whether
it
has
the
power
to
simply
declare
those
injunctions
void,
as
distinguished
from
sending
the
matter
back
to
a
court
for
a
court
to
determine
whether
its
standard
is
met,
is
another
question.
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
congress
could
do
that.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'd
like
to
say
two
things
in
answer
to
that
question.
one
is
that
the...
there
are
injunctions
that
are
enormously
complicated
that
could
not
possibly
be
totally
resolved
in
90
days,
although
it
might
be
that
parts
of
them
could
be.
there's...
there's
nothing
to
prevent
courts
from
addressing
a
termination
motion
piecemeal
or,
indeed,
from...
to
prevent
the
state
from
seeking
to
terminate
a
piece
of
the
injunction,
an
aspect
of
it,
the
medical
care
part
of
it,
or
some
other
part
of
it.
but,
yes,
there
is
a...
there
are...
there
are
numerous
injunctions
that
have
the
kind
of
complexity
that
would
make
a
90-day
resolution
difficult.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
say
about
this
notion
that
congress...
the
statute
might
be
interpreted
as
simply
cutting
everything
off
and
requiring
the
prisoners
to
start
again
is
that
that's
what
congress
rejected.
an
earlier
draft
of
this
statute
would
have
done
exactly
that
and...
and
there
have
been
bills
since
then
to
do
that,
to
say
all
injunctions
will
terminate
in
2
years.
in
fact--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--keep
the
decree
in--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
we
think
it's
implausible
that
the
(a)(2)
preliminary
injunction
applies
to
termination
motions
for
just
the
reasons
that
i
was
starting
to
say.
that
is,
originally
this...
this
statute
was
in
the
form
of
a
bill
that
said
all
injunctions
terminate
in
2
years.
there
was
not
only
an
automatic
stay,
but
there
was
an
automatic
termination,
and
everyone
did
have
to
start
all
over
again
with
an
application
for
new
relief.
and
that...
there
was
serious
criticism
in
hearings
and
so
forth
of
that
bill,
and
congress
amended
it.
and
the
statute
they
enacted
distinguished
sharply
between
termination
motions...
between
the
termination
process
and
the
initial
relief
process.
and
the
termination
process
is
now
no
longer
just
termination.
it's
a
decision
whether
to
terminate
or
continue
the
injunction.
and
that's
in
(v)
and
so
forth
of
the
statute.
and
the
(a)
provision,
which
contains
the
preliminary
injunction,
applies
to
applications
for
new
relief.
so--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes,
but
there
are
differences
of
opinion
about
what
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
at
risk
with
respect
to
liability.
but
in
any
event,
predicting
what
the
state
is
likely
to
do
in
the
interim
i
suppose
is
a
part
of
ordinary
equitable
considerations.
i
suppose
if
the
state
made
some
representations
about
what
it
was
likely
to
do,
that
might
make
interim--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i'm
not
suggesting
any
particular
prediction
about
what
various
state
officials
would
or
would
not
do
and
suggesting,
rather,
that
courts'
traditional
equitable
powers,
precisely
designed
to
deal
with
the
likelihood
of
irreparable
injury
in
a
particular
case
to
a
particular
set
of
prisoners
under
a
particular
decree
in
a
case
with
a
particular
history--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--every
other
automatic
stay
can
be
lifted
by
a
court.
this
automatic
stay
contains,
sometimes
under
expressed
conditions,
sometimes
under
just...
just
general
equitable
authority...
this
automatic
stay
does
not
contain
a
provision
authorizing
a
court
to
lift
it
and
it
does
not
contain
a
provision
prohibiting
a
court
from
lifting
it,
and
that's
why
we
think--
