mr.

chief

mr.
laramore,
let
me
ask
you
one
procedural
question.
the
state's
motion
to
terminate
this
injunction
was
filed
in
1997?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
your
brief
you
say
it's
set
for
hearing
on
the
merits
in
june
of
2000.
is
there
any
explanation
for
the
3-year
delay
in
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
seem
the
appeal
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
going
ahead
with
the
motion
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
3
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
the
term
judgment
is
quite
accurate
here.
a
judgment
traditionally...
it's...
you
get
a
money
judgment
from...
from
a
common
law
court.
i
think
traditionally
you
get
a
decree
from
a
court
of
equity,
which...
you
know,
that's
more
like
the
rufo
case--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
came
up
from
the
first
circuit,
rather
than
like
the
plaut
case
which
i
think
was
a...
a
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
laramore.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
behalf
of
private
parties
or
nongovernment--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
would
think
congress
also
could
find
here
that
many
state
agencies
really
were
quite
happy
under...
under
these
injunctions.
they
could
go
to
the
judge
and
get
their
appropriation,
rather
than
go
to
the
legislature.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
congress
could
treat
it
as
a
special
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
those
precedents--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
mean,
just
a
couple
of
them
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
falk,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
simply
carry
over
from
plaut,
which
was
not
an
equitable
decree,
as
i...
to
equitable
decrees
which
have
been
traditionally
revisable--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
seems
to
me
is
not
an
automatic
step.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
that
wheeling
bridge
is
as
clear
as
you
say
about
the
congress
having
enacted
a
new
law.
i...
i
think
one
can
read
it
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
mr.
falk,
that
congress
can't
make
rules
regarding
the
injunctive
authority
of...
of
courts?
look
at
the
norris-laguardia
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
thought
you
had
said
a
moment
earlier
that
congress
was
just
very,
very
limited
in
dealing
with
what
you
referred
to
as
the
central
authority
of...
of
the
courts.
and
i
don't
think
that...
that's
correct.
i
think
you
have
to
qualify
that
statement
a
good
deal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
falk.
the
case
is
submitted.
