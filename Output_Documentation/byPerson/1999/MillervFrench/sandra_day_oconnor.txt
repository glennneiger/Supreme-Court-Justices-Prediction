justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
just
to
explore
this
a
little
further,
let's
suppose
the
lawsuit
was
brought
by
the
prisoners
and
it
was
determined
by
the
court
that
the
prison
was
putting
six
people
in
a
single
cell
room
that
would
properly
hold
only
two
and
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
making
it
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
further,
that
the
prison
was
providing
only
1,000
calories
of
food
a
day,
whereas
to
sustain
normal
weight
and
life,
2,000
calories
a
day
were
required.
now,
let's
just
take
that
as
an
example.
finding
a
constitutional
violation
and
entering
a
decree
that
that
must
be
remedied
by
reducing
it
to
two
people
to
a
cell
and
increasing
the
food.
now,
you
say
that
congress
can
come
in
and
automatically
end
that
order
for
relief
based
on
the
motion
by
the
state,
that
that's
okay,
that
that
does
not
invoke
the
concerns
that
the
court
expressed
in
plaut
with
interference
with
the
judgment
of
a
court
in
a
decided
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
have
to
say
anything.
you...
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
a
motion
under
this
plra
and
say,
we
file
a
motion
to
terminate
the
ongoing
relief.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
read
the
language
in
3626(e)(2),
any
motion
to
modify
or
terminate
prospective
relief
shall
operate
as
a
stay,
as
unambiguous.
and
i
read
this
whole
thing
as
a
clear
indication
by
congress
that
it
wanted
to
do
exactly
what
the
state
was
arguing
ought
to
be
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
automatic.
now,
let's
say
we
read
it
that
way.
is
there
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
said
that,
but
is
there
a
violation
if
we
read
it
as
a
clear
intent
by
congress
to
have
it
operate
just
the
way
the
state
says?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--examples
of...
a
congressional
interference
that
would
be
upheld.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
really
doesn't
affect
the
determination
of
the
violation,
does
it?
i
mean,
the
determination--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
a
court
that
there's
been
a
constitutional
violation
is
not
affected.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
affected
if
its
upheld
is
the
remedial
power
of
the
court,
not
the
substantive
holding
of
the
violation.
it
would
place
substantive
limits
on
the
remedies
that
can
be
employed.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
the
court
determines
that
the
relief
meets
the
remedial
standard
adopted
by
congress,
that
it
is
narrowly
tailored
and
no
greater
than
necessary,
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
1996,
congress
enacted
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
all
these
things
have
acronyms;
this
one
is
called
the
plra,
and
as
relevant
here
that
plra
establishes
standards
for
the
entry
and
termination
of
prospective
relief
in
civil
actions
challenging
prison
conditions.
specifically
section
3626(b)
provides
that
prospective
relief
must
be
supported
by
findings
and
precisely
tailored
to
what
is
needed
to
remedy
the
violation
of
a
federal
right.
if
prospective
relief,
under
an
existing
injunction,
does
not
satisfy
these
standards,
the
plra
entitles
a
defendant
or
intervenor
to
immediate
termination
of
the
prospective
relief.
under
the
automatic
stay
provision
of
the
plra,
the
provision
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
a
motion
determinate
prospective
relief
shall
operate
as
a
stay
of
that
relief
during
the
period
beginning
30
days
after
filing
of
the
motion
which
is
extendable
up
to
90
days
for
good
cause.
the
stay
ends
when
the
court
rules
on
the
motion
for
termination.
in
1997,
the
superintendent
of
the
pendleton
correctional
facility,
which
is
currently
operating
under
an
ongoing
injunction
governing
the
conditions
of
confinement
there,
filed
a
motion
to
terminate
the
prospective
relief.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
automatic
stay
provision
of
the
plra.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
concluding
that
although
the
state
provision
precluded
courts
from
using
their
equitable
powers
to
enjoin
the
stay,
the
statue
so
construed
was
unconstitutional
on
separation
of
power’s
grounds.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
automatic
stay
provision
precludes
federal
courts
from
exercising
their
traditional
equitable
powers
to
enjoin
the
automatic
stay.
we
conclude
that
it
does,
the
text
of
the
statue
unambiguously
requires
that
the
motion
shall
operate
as
a
stay
during
a
specific
time
period.
any
construction
of
this
language
that
allowed
courts
to
use
their
equitable
discretion
to
enjoin
a
stay
would
be
plainly
contrary
to
congress’
intent
because
it
would
convert
the
mandatory
stay
into
a
discretionary
one.
given
this
construction,
we
must
address
whether
the
stay
provision
offends
separation
of
powers
principles.
in
1995,
in
a
case
called
plaut
versus
spendthrift
farm,
we
held
that
a
statue
that
required
federal
courts
to
reopen
final
judgments
entered
before
the
status’s
enactment
was
unconstitutional.
we
distinguished
in
that
case,
however,
those
situations
in
which
the
legislation
altered
the
prospective
effect
of
previously
entered
injunctions.
we
have
held
that
prospective
relief
remains
subject
to
alteration
due
to
changes
in
the
underlying
law.
section
3626(b),
if
the
plra
changes
the
relevant
underlying
law
by
establishing
new
standards
for
the
enforcement
of
prospective
relief.
by
staying
prospective
relief
that
is
no
longer
enforceable
under
the
new
standards,
the
stay
provision
merely
reflects
the
change
in
the
underlying
law;
it
does
not
suspend
or
reopen
a
final
judgment.
consequently,
we
conclude
that
the
stay
provision
does
not
offends
separation
of
powers
principle.
