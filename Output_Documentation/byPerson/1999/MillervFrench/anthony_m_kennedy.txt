well,
in...
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
that...
that
you
just
gave
explaining
the
authority
of
the
congress
to,
for
want
of
a
better
term,
modify
the
terms
of
the
decree,
i
kept
waiting
for
you
to
use
the
term
prospective.
and
you
seemed
almost
careful
not
to
do
that.
i...
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
this
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
a
prospective--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--operation
of...
of
a
statute.
it
does
not
undo
previously
adjudicated
rights
in
the
sense
that
a
money
judgment
would
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
there...
there
it
was
almost
like
a
property
right,
a
navigation
servitude
that
the
united
states
had
the...
could
surrender
at
its
will
anyway.
do
you
have
another
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
looked
and
i
thought
wheeling
was
the
closest,
but
i
think
it's
quite
distinguishable.
