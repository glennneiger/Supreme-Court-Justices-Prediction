justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
request--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
laramore,
did
you
ask
the
district
court
to
proceed
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
ask
the
district
court.
you
truly
have
no
basis
for
going
to
mandamus
a
court
to
do
something
that
you
didn't
ask
it
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
laramore,
i
didn't...
i
know
that's
your
argument,
but
i
didn't
follow
it
entirely
because
it
seems
to
me
if
you
suspend
the
decree
and
it
doesn't
become
operative
again
until
all
the
findings
that
have
been
made...
all
the
findings
required
by
the
new
act
had
been
made,
how
is
that
different
from
just
starting
fresh
and
making
those
findings?
it
seems
to
me
to
say
suspended
is
kind
of
a
euphemism
for
terminated
because
you
don't
get
it
back
again
unless
you
establish
what
you
would
have
to
establish
to
get
a
decree
under
the
new
law
in
the
first
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
answered
my
question
to
say
that
it
was,
once
it's
suspended,
apart
from
the
label.
it's
like
starting
the
case
all
over
again.
but
to...
to
continue
justice
scalia's
line
of
questioning,
does
the
30
days,
extendable
to
90
days,
mean
anything?
on
your
theory
of
the
case,
couldn't
congress
have
simply
said,
as
of
the
day
this
new
law
goes
into
effect,
all
bets
are
off,
any
prison
litigation
has
to
start
anew
with
a
fresh
complaint
and
meet
the
standards
that
we
set
in
this
new
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
is
there
anything
on...
anything
that's
constitutionally
required
by
giving
the
district
court
any
time
at
all
in
your
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--prison
litigation
where
the
finding
has
been
made
not
just
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
but
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
in
this
and
that
and
the
other
particular--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
justice
o'connor
spelled
out.
and
a
court
has
made
that
finding,
that
it
violates
the
eighth
amendment
in
these
particulars
and
then
congress
can
say,
never
mind
that.
during
the
interim,
the
decree
is
out
of...
out
of
force
entirely.
that...
there
has
been
a
finding
of
a
constitutional
violation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--specific
ways.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
questioned,
at
least
in
this
litigation,
the
(e)(1)
of
the
statute
that
says,
district
courts,
act
promptly
and
if
you
don't
act
promptly,
you
can
be
mandamused
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
say
no
matter
how
complex
the
case
is,
you
have
30
days
or
90
days,
i
don't
know
of
any
legislation
like
that,
do
you?
is
there
anything...
any
other
statute
like
that
that
says--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
result
of
the
speedy
trial
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
the
defendant
can't
be
tried.
and
here
it's
the
prisoners
get
their
judgment
taken
away
from
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
hasn't...
mr.
laramore,
under
the
new
standard,
they
have...
they
said
it's
unconstitutional,
but
they
haven't
said
it's
the
least...
that
the...
the
order
is
the
least
intrusive
way
to
do...
to
take
care
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
it's
unconstitutional
but
attrition
or
something
like
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
underwood,
those
were
all
cases
where
the
court
made
the
adjustment
required
by
the
new
law,
and
that's
what
(e)(1)
of
this
statute
does.
it
says,
court,
act
promptly
and
if
you
don't,
the
court
of
appeals
can
look
over
your
shoulder.
i...
i
asked
mr.
laramore
was
there
any
statute
that
says,
court,
no
matter
how
complex
the
decision
is,
if
you
don't
meet
the
30
days,
extendable
to
90
days,
then
the
winner
becomes
a
loser.
i
don't
know
any
statute
that
operates
that
way,
rather
than
saying
to
the
court,
act
promptly
but
we're
not
going
to
turn
the
winner
into
a
loser
if
you
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
underwood,
is...
one...
one
part
of
your
argument
you
say
if
for
the
interim
you
can
meet
the
preliminary
injunction
type
standards,
irreparable
harm,
probability
of
success
on
the
merits,
then
you
can
keep
the
stay
in
effect.
but
one
of
the
amici--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
one
of
the
amici
in
this
case
said
that
this
new
legislation
provides
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
as
i
see
that
provision,
the
standards
are
identical
to
what
you're
urging
is
necessary
to
keep
the
decree
in
force,
irreparable
harm,
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
and
yet,
in
the
new
act
that
comes
with
a
time
limit.
a
preliminary
injunction
can
remain
in
force
only
90
days.
so,
tops
you
could
have
180
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
underwood,
on
your
bankruptcy
code
analogy,
there
are
provisions
that
congress
made
for
modification
of
the
stay.
and
that
seems
to
me
is...
is
conspicuously
absent
here.
automatic
stay
is
used
in
both,
but
the
bankruptcy
act
says
the
court
can
modify
it,
it
can
place
conditions
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
will...
it's
not
a
judgment
at
law.
it's
an
equity
decree
that
is
ongoing.
and
surely,
one
characteristic
of
an
equity
decree
of
this
kind
is
it
is
modifiable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
falk,
do
you
know
in...
in
this
connection
whether
there
is
an
automatic
stay
provision
like
this
one?
justice
breyer
said
it's
like
any
other
provision
for
an
automatic
stay.
i...
i
brought
out
before
that
the
bankruptcy
code
is
quite
explicit
that
congress...
that
the...
the
court
can
modify
on
condition
that
automatic
stay.
is
there
another
piece
of
legislation,
just
as
automatic
stay,
where
the
court
can
say,
yes,
but
we
don't
think
so
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
falk,
i
don't
understand
the
analogy
between
the
tro
and
norris-laguardia,
these
short-life
orders.
i
thought
that
those
time
limits
were
imposed
by
congress
not
to
squelch
the
courts,
but
to
respect
the
rights
of
a
defendant
who
has
been
slapped
with
an
injunction
and
told
to
stop
and
in
many
cases
on
an
ex
parte
basis.
so,
i
think
it...
it
would
be
arguably
a...
more
than
arguably...
a
violation
of
due
process
if
a
court
were
given
the
power
to
stop
a
defendant
from
acting
cold
until
the
court
gets
around
to
adjudicating
the
merits.
