justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
long,
why
does
that
follow,
because
in
other
schemes...
take
title
vii,
for
example,
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
when
congress
means
to
create
both
a
private
right
of
action
and
an
executive
enforcement
scheme
it
provides
specifically
for
a
private
right
of
action,
not
in
the
air,
but
against
the
employer
in
the
case
of
title
vii
and
in
the
case
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so
the
normal
pattern,
when
congress
wants
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
against
the
person
who
could
be
subject
to
executive
action,
congress
makes
that
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
conspicuous
absence
is,
here
it
says,
executive,
you
can
go
after
the
party
in
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
say,
private
plaintiff,
you
can
go
against
the
party
in
interest,
and
that
is
what
these
other
statutes
that
have
dual
enforcement
schemes
do
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
it...
didn't
salomon
say
that
if
it
loses
here
it
does
want
to
contest
whether
it's
a
party
in
interest
and
whether
this
is
a
prohibited
transaction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
are
supposed
to
assume
for
purposes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
decision
two
things
that
may
be
the
case
to
be
decided
no
matter
what
we
said
here.
that
is,
we're
supposed
to
assume
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
party
in
interest,
that
salomon
is
a
party
in
interest,
and
that
this
is
a
prohibited
transaction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
neither
may
turn
out
to
be
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
the
two
go
together?
maybe
the
secretary
can
but
the
private
individual
can't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
very
same
language
is
used
in
the
provision
allowing
the
secretary
to
sue.
it
also
doesn't
say
whom,
whom
it
may
sue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hein,
why,
any
more
than
many
schemes
where
congress
has
said,
like
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
if
the
secretary
went
out
suing
all
the
employers
who
violated
the
wage
and
hours
law
there
would
be
no
need
for
private
suits,
so
i
don't
think
that
what
you
just
said
really
holds
up,
because
there
are
many
times
when
congress
provides
for
executive
action
and
penalties
and
still
allows
a
private
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
not
inconsistent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's...
502(a)(5),
you
say
these
two
travel
together,
and
the
secretary
no
more
than
the
private
individual
can
bring
a
suit
against
anyone
other
than
the
fiduciary.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
secretary's
right
is
identical
to
the
private
person's
right,
and
that
is,
it's
only
against
the
fiduciary
under
(a)(3)
and
(a)(5),
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
i
wanted
to
know
what
is
your
position.
i
thought
you
would
answer
that
with
a
firm,
that's
right,
the
secretary
can't
sue
the
party
in
interest
either,
the
only
one
against
whom
a
suit
would
lie
under
501(a)(3)
or
(a)(5)
is
the
fiduciary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
want...
my
question
really
was,
you
see
the
same
limits
on
(a)(5)
as
(a)(3)?
that
is,
whatever
a
private
individual
could
sue
for
under
(a)(3),
the
secretary
can,
but
the
secretary
can't
sue
anyone
who
would
not
be
amenable
to
suit
by
a
private
party
under
(a)(5),
as
distinguished
from
(a)(6)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
asked
if
that
was
your
position
that
the
secretary
has
no
broader
authority
than
the
private
suitor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
bring
this
kind
of
suit
against
a
party
in
interest--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
anyone
who
was
allegedly
unjustly
enriched.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
hein,
why
isn't
it...
if
this
is...
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
can
get
these
stiff
penalties
against
the
party
in
interest
specifically,
why
isn't
it
clear
from
that
that
this
transaction
is
prohibited
as
to
the
party
in
interest,
otherwise
how
could
the...
how
could
congress
say,
secretary,
you
can
hit
them
with
100
percent?
so
there
is...
there
is
a
provision
in
this
complex
law
that
says
the
party
in
interest
is
subject
to
penalty
for
engaging
in
a
prohibited
transaction.
that's
what...
what
is
it
+/?
4975
is
all
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
just
trying
to
clarify
the
argument
that
you
were
making
before,
which
seemed
to
say
that
the
person,
the
party
in
interest
is
out
of
it,
and
that
is
certainly
not
the
case,
because
4975
puts
the
party
in
interest
right
into
the
position
of
being
a
violator
of
406
prohibited
transactions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
where
does
it
pick
up
the
word,
prohibited
transaction
from?
isn't
that
in
title
i.?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
or
does
it
not
hit
a
party
in
interest
who
engages
in
a
prohibited
transaction?
does
4975
enable
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
go
after
a
party
in
interest
who
has
been
on
one
side
of
a
prohibited
transaction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
but
in
effect
and
in
purpose,
to
get
that
party
in
interest
to
disgorge
and
return
to
make
restitution,
because
if
the
party
does,
then
they're
not
subject
to
the
100
percent
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
only
simple
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
you
can't
say
the
party
in
interest
is
not
liable
for
entering
a
prohibited
transaction.
they
are
under
that
section.
that
was
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
justice
stevens
had
a
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
that
ever
happened
in
all
the
application
of
this
penalty,
that
somebody
has
opted
to
give...
in
effect,
to
make
restitution
to
the
government
rather
than
to
the
trustee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
serving
its
purpose
to
get
the
money
back
to
the
plan,
rather
than
in
the
coffers
of
the
treasury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
very
case,
the
whole
object
of
going
after
salomon,
i
take
it,
is
that
they
are
the
party
that
ended
up
with
the
money
and
nobody
else
and
then
the
investment,
when
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
plan,
went
down
the
tube.
so
the
argument
is,
yeah,
we
could
sue
the
fiduciary,
who
made
nothing
out
of
this
deal.
the
only
one
who
made
anything
out
of
it
is
salomon.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
just
the
simple
point
is,
who
ended
up
with
the
money
and
who
had
nothing
as
a
result
of
this?
the
allegation
is
that
the...
salomon
was
paid
before
the
market
went
bust
on
this
kind
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is
not
getting
into
the...
i
don't
mean
to
get
into
the
merits
of
it.
all
i'm
saying
is,
as
you
looked...
if
you
were
looking
around
for
whom
to
sue,
you
would
pick
the
person
who
got
the
gain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
of
course
you
would
have
to
show
that
it
was
indeed
a
prohibited
transaction,
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
party
in
interest.
