mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
erisa
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
appropriate
equitable
relief
against
a
party
in
interest
who
engages
in
a
prohibited
transaction
with
an
erisa
plan.
the
text
of
erisa
provides
that
such
actions
are
available
for
two
reasons,
and
they
correspond
to
our
two
arguments
today.
first,
based
on
all
the
relevant
statutory
language,
erisa's
prohibited
transaction
provisions
apply
to
parties
in
interest
as
well
as
to
fiduciaries
and,
second,
erisa's
carefully
crafted
civil
enforcement
provisions
in
section
502
authorize
actions
for
restitution
of
plan
assets
transferred
in
a
prohibited
transaction
without
regard
to
whether
the
party
in
interest
is
itself
deemed
a
violator
of
erisa.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again,
we
make
two
arguments,
justice--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
our
first
argument
is
that
outside
of
section
502(a)(3)
erisa
does
say
in
section
406
and
section
502(i)
and
section
4975
that
parties
in
interest
are
not
to
engage
in
prohibited
transactions.
if
they
do,
they're
subject
to
punitive
penalties
and
taxes,
so
that
distinguishes
the
party
in
interest
transactions
from
other
sorts
of
nonfiduciary
activity.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
and
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
is
our--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
that
is
our
second
argument,
and
under
our
second
argument,
looking
to
the
language
of
502(a)(3),
the
plain
language,
it...
you're
correct,
it
does
not
matter
when
there
is
a
violation
of...
any
violation
of
any
provision
of
title
i,
the
plain
language
of
502(a)(3)
is
that
there
shall
be
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
appropriate,
equitable
relief
to
redress
the
violation,
and
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
i
mean,
congress...
the
court
has
said
several
times
that
this
is
a
very
carefully
crafted
provision
and
the
court
will
not
tamper
with
its
language,
and
it's...
what
congress
did
here
was
deliberate.
it's...
if
you
look
at
other
provisions,
the
preceding
subsection
502(a)(2),
that's
limited
to
fiduciaries.
if
you
look
at
the
preceding
section--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--50...
the
statutory
provisions,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
502(a)(2)
is
on
page
254
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
that
provision
provides
for
an
action
by
the
secretary
or
by
a
participant
beneficiary
or
fiduciary
for
appropriate
relief
under
section
409,
and
section
409,
in
turn,
is
limited
to
fiduciary
breaches,
and
two
other
examples,
if
you
look
to
section--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
point--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
point
very
simply,
justice
scalia,
is
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
limit
502(a)(3)
to
any
fiduciary
who
violates
any
provision
of
erisa
or
any
person
who
violates
any
provision
of
erisa,
it
would
have
said
so.
502(a)(2)
is
an
example
of
a
limitation
to
fiduciaries.
another
good
example
is
the
federal
employee
retirement
system
statute
that's
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
in
footnote
1
of
our
reply
brief.
that
is
a
provision
that
is
modeled
directly
on
502(a)(3).
congress
picked
up
precisely
the
language
of
502(a)(3)
with
an
important
change.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it's...
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
on
page
1,
and
it
carries
over
onto
page
2
in
the
first
footnote.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
that
provision
says
that
a
civil
action
may
be
brought
by
the
secretary
of
labor
or
any
participant
beneficiary
or
fiduciary
against
any
fiduciary
to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice
which
violates
any
provision,
or
to
obtain
any
other
appropriate
equitable
relief,
so
when
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
cause
of
action
to
any
fiduciary
or
any
person,
it
knew
how
to
do
it.
another
provision
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
and
i
apologize
for
this,
section
501
of
erisa
that
precedes
502,
that
section
provides
that
any
person
who
wilfully
violates
any
provision
of
the
reporting
and
disclosure
requirements
is
liable,
so
congress
was
very
deliberate
about
the
language
it
used.
when
it
wanted
to
limit
liability
to
any
person
or
any
fiduciary,
it
said
so.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it
says
any
act
or
practice
which
violates
a
provision
of
erisa,
and
then
it
says,
for
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
the
violation,
and
that
dovetails
with
the
reference
to
any
act
or
practice,
because
appropriate
equitable
relief
certainly
includes
a
constructive
trust,
and
the
nature
of
a
constructive
trust
is
that
it
follows
the
assets.
it
doesn't
look
to
whether
the
person
in
possession
of
the
assets
was
a
violator.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it
is
based--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
first,
this
is
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
we're
attributing
this
to
congress
because
congress
expressly
referred
to
appropriate
equitable
relief.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
second,
it
is
a
self
limiting
type
of
relief.
the
constructive
trust
only
applies
in
limited
situations
where--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
gimmick,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
expressly
referred
to
by
the
senate
in
the
report
that
created
this
appropriate
equitable
relief
provision.
it's
a
well
established--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
restitution
pursuant
to
a
constructive
trust
is
a
classic
form
of
equitable
relief,
so
that
is...
that's
how
a
constructive
trust
gets
into
it.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
precisely,
and
again,
to
switch
back
to...
we
have
the
narrower
argument
and
the
broader
argument.
certainly
in
the
context
of
a
prohibited
transaction
what
congress
expressly
said,
parties
in
interest
are
not
to
engage
in
these
transactions.
if
they
do,
they
are
subject
to
punitive
taxes
and
civil--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
court
has
always
refused,
in
construing
erisa
and
other
statutes
as
well,
to
look
simply
to
any
single
phrase,
and
when
you
look
not
only
to
406
but
to
other
provisions
such
as
3003,
that's
a
provision
of
erisa
that
says...
it
refers
expressly
to
a
part...
a
violation
of
section
406
by
a
party
in
interest,
so
there's
an
express
statement
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
a
party
in
interest
can
violate
section
406.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
section
3003
simply
is
a
reporting
provision
coordinating
between
the
labor
and
treasury
departments.
it
says
whenever
the
secretary
of
labor
has
information
that
a
party
in
interest
is
violating
section
406,
it
shall
report
the
information
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
but
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
also
section
502(i)
and
section
4975,
which
just
as
you
say,
impose
on
parties
in
interest
these
heavy
taxes
or
civil
penalties,
which
are
really
designed
not
only
to
keep
the
party
in
interest
from
entering
into
the
transaction
but,
if
it
does,
it's
supposed
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
plan.
there's
an
incentive
to
correct
the
transaction.
that's
a
defined
term
that
means,
give
the
money
back,
so
certainly
in
the
narrow
context
of
a
prohibited
transaction
allowing
a
participant
or
a
beneficiary
or
a
fiduciary
to
sue
for
precisely
that,
that
is,
to
get
back
the
plan's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
and
our
submission
is
that
congress
did
make
it
clear
here
in
these
carefully
crafted
provisions
of
section
502.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
but
in
this
statute,
i
mean,
in
each
case
the
court's
obligation,
of
course,
is
to
follow
the
plain
language
as
congress
wrote
it,
unless
there's
some
strong
reason
to
depart
from
it,
and
here
the
language
of
502(a)(3)
and
502(a)(5),
which
is
a
parallel
provision
that
gives
the
secretary
of
labor
authority
to
bring
an
action
for
appropriate
equitable
relief
for
any
violation
of
erisa,
both
of
those
provisions
are
broadly
written.
what
congress
did
here
was,
it
provided
some
specific...
they're
not
really
remedies,
but
taxes
and
civil
penalties,
and
it
also
provided
a
general
catch
all
provision.
the
court
addressed
this
in
varity
and
said
the
fact
that
congress
has
addressed
it
narrowly
does
not
mean
that
we
shouldn't
give
the
full
effect
to
its
broad
language
as
well.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
that's
absolutely
correct,
but
our
argument
is
not
simply
that
we
don't
think
congress
in
any
respect
could
have
cut
back
on
any
rights
that
participants
or
beneficiaries
had
pre
erisa,
and
our
argument
is
again
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
this
carefully
crafted
language
in
section
502,
and
when
you
see
how
the
pieces
dovetail
together
it's
just
clear
that
congress
did
not
limit
this
to
any
person
who
violates
erisa,
or
any
fiduciary
who
violates
erisa.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think...
a
few
points.
one
is,
i
mean,
certainly
there
are
the
excise
taxes
and
the
civil
penalties
which
apply
to
all
these
prohibited
transactions,
so
to
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no,
i
mean,
i
think
in
part
you're
quite
right,
and
it
shows
how
serious
congress
was
about
these
prohibited
transaction
provisions.
it
really
wanted...
it
really
was
a
shift.
it
wanted
to
bar
these
transactions
categorically,
but
then
subject
to
exemptions,
and
i
think
a
big
part
of
the
answer
to
the
difficulty
you're
having
is
section
408
does
create
certain
exemptions.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
we
get
by
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today,
that
will
be
an
issue.
whether
this
is,
in
fact,
entitled
to
an
exemption
is
an
issue.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
oh,
yes.
that's...
there
are
many...
and
ameritech
can
attest
that
it's
delegated
its
fiduciary
responsibility
here,
so
ameritech's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
what
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it...
no.
it
does
matter
and
that's
because,
as
the
court
said
in
mertens,
there's
not
equitable
relief
at
large.
there
has
to
be
equitable
relief
to
address
a
violation
of
erisa.
if
there's
not
a
prohibited
transaction,
there's
no
violation
of
erisa,
so
no
equitable
relief
would
be
appropriate,
so
it
would
matter.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
a
question
earlier
about
what
exemption
salomon
is
relying
on
here.
it's
prohibited
transaction
exemption
75-1,
and
that
actually
i
think
answers
the
question.
it
is
cited
in
respondent's
brief...
let's
see...
yes,
it's
in
the
federal
register,
but
basically
it
shows
how
many
of
these
transactions
are
clearly
subject
to
an
exemption,
and
it's
not
going
to
cause
great
difficulties.
basically,
under
this
exemption,
if
a
security
is
sold
at
the
market
price
you're
basically
in
a
safe
harbor.
you
can
show
that
the
plan
didn't
get
a
bad
deal,
and
if
the
security
goes
down
to
a
low
level,
as
some
have
been
doing
recently,
that's...
the
plan
is
out
of
luck.
this
case
is
different.
these
purchase
fee
agreements
are
sort
of
special
things.
it's
very
difficult
to
value
them,
and
that's
exactly
the
situation
where
congress
wanted
the
parties
in
interest
to
be
very
careful.
and
there
are
problems
the
other
way.
that
is...
well,
the
other
thing
i'll
say
is,
we've
been
living
with
this
system
now
for
years,
and
it
has
not
caused
great
problems.
that
is,
the
parties
in
interest
are
not
only
subject
to
the
taxes
and
the
civil
penalties,
but
everywhere
in
the
country,
except
now
recently
in
the
seventh
circuit
they
have
been
subject
to
these
suits
by
the
secretary
and
by
fiduciaries,
and
by
parties,
participants
and
beneficiaries,
and
it
has
not
caused
great
problems,
so
we've
been
essentially
running
an
experiment
with
this,
and
it's
been...
it's
not
been
a
problem.
there
are
problems
the
other
way.
that
is,
if
you
were
to
hold
502(a)(3)
and
502(a)(5)
don't
apply
according
to
their
terms...
you
were
exploring
the
issue
about
the
billion
dollars
of
assets
that
walks
off.
another
situation
that
comes
up
is
if
assets
are
paid
by
mistake
to
a
participant
or
a
beneficiary,
and
this
can...
is
supposed
to
be
a
one
time
lump
sum,
and
suppose
the
computer
gets
misprogrammed,
and
instead
of
paying
out
$100,000
once
it
starts
paying
out
$100,000
every
month.
that
is,
an
annuity.
well,
if
502(a)(3)
isn't
available,
there's
no
way
that
the
plan
can
get
that
money
back
if
the
participant
says,
well,
sorry,
your
mistake.
i've
cashed
the
checks.
of
course,
the
fiduciary,
if
it's
solvent,
would
have
to
make
up
the
difference,
but
if
it's
not,
the
other
plan
participants
and
beneficiaries--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
very
important,
and
i
mean,
equity
itself
is
self
limiting.
it
has
to
be
something
that
the
party
in
interest
knew
or
should
have
known,
and
if
it's...
might
very
well
be
unreasonable
for
parties
in
interest
to
inquire
whether
the
fiduciary
is
keeping
all
the
records,
i
would
think
it
would
be,
and
in
that
case
this
sort
of
equitable
relief
would
not
be
available.
it
would
not
be
appropriate.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
a
prohibited
transaction,
justice
scalia.
when
a
service
provider
provides
services
to
the
plan
and
is
paid
excessive
compensation,
which
means
truly
excessive,
not
just
something
over
the
market
rate,
that
is
a
prohibited
transaction,
and
it
could
be
subject
to
equitable
restitution.
