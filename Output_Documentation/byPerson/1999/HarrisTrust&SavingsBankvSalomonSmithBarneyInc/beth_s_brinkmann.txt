ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
prohibited
transaction
provisions
of
erisa
to
protect
plan
assets
from
overreaching
by
parties
and
persons
who
deal
with
the
plan.
under
section
502(a)(3)
recovery
of
plan
assets
from
parties
in
interest
who
obtained
assets
through
a
prohibited
transaction
is
appropriate
equitable
relief.
the
penalty
and
tax
provisions
of
erisa
make
clear
that
the
preference
is
for
disgorgement
of
such
assets
from
a
party
in
interest
who
receives
such
assets.
to
enforce
those
provisions,
the
secretary
of
labor
goes
to
court
under
a
virtually
identical
provision,
502(a)(5)
to
enforce
the
restitution,
and
under
(a)(6)
to
enforce
the
penalties.
justice
breyer,
you
had
been
inquiring
about
the
reach
of
the
prohibited
transactions.
i
think
it
might
be
useful,
to
understand
it,
to
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
exemptions.
for
example,
at
joint
appendix
page
246
there's
a
general
exemption
for
contracting
or
making
reasonable
arrangements
with
a
party
in
interest
for
things
like
office
space,
legal,
accounting
or
other
services,
so
long
as
it's
no
more
than
a
reasonable
compensation
is
paid.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
as
it
stands,
however,
the
parties
in
interest
and
fiduciaries
are
all
bound
by
these
rules
and
regulations
because
they
can
be
subject
up
to
100
percent
penalty
and
tax
on
these
transactions,
but
the
structure
of
the
law
makes
clear
that
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
the
secretary
of
labor
in
good
faith
needs
to
be
able
to
come
to
court
to
also,
to
get
restitution
under
the
parallel
provision
of
(a)(5).
that's
crucial
to
the
enforcement
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
the
language
is
identical
in
relevant
respects,
and
the
statute
makes
quite
clear
that
that
is
the
priority
of
recouping
the
assets
to
the
plan.
the
purpose
was
not
to
generate
additional
money
for
the
public
fisc.
one
provision
that
makes
that
very
clear
is
requiring
the
remarkable,
quite
frankly,
provision
that
the
secretary
of
treasury,
before
assessing
the
tax,
must
refer
it
to
the
secretary
of
labor
to
obtain
a
correction,
and
that
is
when
the
secretary
tries
voluntary
means
to
do
that
through
negotiations
and
letters
of
notice
and
all,
and
then
can
go
into
court
to
sue
for
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
recoup
those
assets
for
the
plan.
that's
crucial
to
the
secretary's
enforcements,
and
that's
under
the
parallel
provision
of
(a)(5).
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
so
long
as
they
are
a
person
from
whom
appropriate
equitable
relief
can
be
obtained
to
redress
a
violation,
and
that
is
quite
a
limiting
principle,
your
honor.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
it's
based
on
unjust
enrichment.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
25
years
of
experience
or
more
would
actually
show
that
it's
not
a
problem
and
not
extraordinary.
before
this
court
of
appeals
entered
the
judgment
in
this
case,
at
least
six
other
circuits
had
held
that
there
was
this
type
of
cause
of
action,
and
the
secretary
has
been
bringing
suits
under
(a)(5)
since
the
seventies,
so--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
do
think
the
concerns
your
honor...
were
very
well
put
by
your
honor
that
it
may
be
the
scope
of
the
prohibited
transaction--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--in
addition--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
can
understand
that.
i
think
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
there
are
the
statutory
exemptions.
second
of
all,
there
are
some
exemptions
enacted,
promulgated
by
regulation
for
certain
classes
of
transactions,
for
instance,
having
to
do
with
security
dealers.
third,
there
is
a
process
for
applying
for
exemptions
to
the
secretary.
another
point
would
be,
your
honor,
is
i
come
back
to
that
these
entities
are
still
going
to
be
liable
for
100
percent
of
that
transaction
and
a
penalty
if
it
is
not
recouped,
and
here
the
purpose
is
to
have
those
assets
go
back
to
the
plan,
and
then
that
diminishes
the
penalty
or
the
taxes
imposed.
each
of
those
provisions,
4975,
502(i),
502(l),
have
specific
provisions
for
the
secretary
to
waive
such
penalties
if
the
transaction
is
corrected,
and
that
is
the
thrust
of
this,
and
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
reason
that
the...
the
transaction
in
question
is
the
selling
of
these
interests
in
the
hotel
industry,
the
hotel--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
that
has
not
been
litigated,
i'm
sorry.
that's
being
reserved
for
the
case
on...
for
the
proceedings
after
this.
this
issue
was
decided
on
summary
judgment,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
important,
your
honors,
to
recognize
that
to
not
permit
the
secretary
to
bring
this
kind
of
suit
under
502(a)(5)
and
other
parties
to
bring
it
under
(a)(3)
would
significantly
undermine
the
purposes
of
the
prohibited
transactions.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
would
be
a
difficult
matter,
i
think,
as
far
as
statutory
construction
would
go,
your
honor,
but
we
would
certainly
urge
that
the
court
find
some--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
in
fact
the
structure
of
virtually
all
of
the
cause
of
actions
under
502(a),
but
we
think
that's
because
the
appropriate
equitable
relief
goes
to
the
main
purpose
of
erisa
and
that
is,
again,
maintaining
the
financial
soundness
of
the
plans,
recouping
those
assets
to
the
plan,
not
generating
money
for
the
federal
treasury.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
it's
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
long
history--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
the
long
history
of
this
makes
clear
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
party
at
interest
is
defined
by
the
plan,
and
in
order
to
have
this
type
of
cause
of
action
there
has
to
be
a
prohibited
transaction
violation,
and
that
means
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
specifically
identified
statutory
transactions
between
a
fiduciary
and
a
party
in
interest.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
under
subsections
(a)
and
(d)
there
was
an
exchange
of
plan
assets.
if
you
look
at...
the
prohibited
transactions
are
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
beginning
on
page
242.
this
would
come
under
407(a)(1)(a),
where
there
was
a
sale
or
exchange
or
leasing
of
property
between
a
plan
and
a
party
in
interest,
or
(d),
a
transfer
to
or
use
or
of
the
benefit
of
a
party
in
interest
of
any
assets
of
the
plan.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
