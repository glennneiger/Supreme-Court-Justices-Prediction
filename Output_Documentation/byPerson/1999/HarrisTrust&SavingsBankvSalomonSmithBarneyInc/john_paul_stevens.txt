justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
about
406?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
got
to
kind
of
go
a
little
slow.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
what
the
fiduciary
can
do,
but
is
your
adversary
correct
in
saying
that
if
the
fiduciary
did
this
it
was
a
prohibited
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is...
was
the
transaction
at
issue
in
this
suit
prohibited
by
406(1)(a)
or
406(1)(b),
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
mean.
for
purposes
of
our
decision...
you
may
win
later
on,
obviously,
but
for
purposes
of
our
decision
there
was
a
sale
by
a
fiduciary
which
violated
406(a)(1)(a)
and
406(a)(1)(d)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
no,
no,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we're
assuming
that
they
may
be
able
to
prove
whatever
they
have
to
prove
on
remand
that
would
establish
those
facts,
and
your
argument
is,
that
doesn't
matter,
you
still
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
ones
we're
talking
about
do
refer
to
a
party
in
interest.
at
least
the
406(a)(1)(a),
and
(a)(1)(d),
do
depend
on
your
being
a
party
in
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
you're
only
saying,
it's
a
prohibited
transaction
because
of
misconduct
by
the
fiduciary.
that's
what
your
point
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
nevertheless
is
a
prohibited
transaction,
and
the
argument
by
them
is
that
a
party
in
interest
who
engages
in
such
a
transaction
knowingly
may
not
keep
the
benefit
of
the
transaction
without
being
unjustly
enriched.
that's
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hein--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about...
it's
a
little
bit
of
a
variation
of
justice
breyer's
question,
but
the
other
appropriate
relief
language
in
502(3),
or...
what
about
rescission?
the
typical
transaction
that
i
recall
being
sort
of
the
thing
that
congress
clearly
wanted
to
prohibit
was
a
fund,
a
pension
fund
using
its
assets
to
dissipate
those
assets
by
buying
properties
from
someone
who
might
be
close
to
one
of
the
trustees,
or
something
like
that,
and
a
new
set
of
trustees
come
in,
they
find
out
about
the
self
dealing,
they
get
new
trustees
elected,
they
want
to
set
aside
the
transaction,
get
their
money
back.
as
i
understand
your
position,
they
could
not
do
that.
even
a
new
fiduciary
couldn't
bring
an
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
i...
but
you
would
apply
the
same
reasoning
to
the
rescission
suit
as
you
would
to
the
unjust
enrichment
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
the
fiduciary
is
solvent.
