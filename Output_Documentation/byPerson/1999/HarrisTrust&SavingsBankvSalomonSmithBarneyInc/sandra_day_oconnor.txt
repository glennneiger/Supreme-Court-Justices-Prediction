where
you
allege
unjust
enrichment--
justice

--on
the
basis
that
the
respondent
was
employed
as
the
investment
advisor
for
this
plan--
justice
sandra

--and
you
allege
knowingly
sold
worthless
property.
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
exactly,
does
it?
it
says
a
fiduciary
shall
not
cause
the
plan
to
engage
in
a
transaction
if
he
knows--
justice

--and

ms.
brinkmann,
do
you
know
what
exemption
is
urged
by
salomon
brothers
to
cover
them?
is
it
this
contracting
for
legal,
accounting,
or
other
services
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
what
exemption
is
urged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
can't
want
to
open
it
up
to
recovery
of
every
bad
investment
that
the
plan
makes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
everybody
is
concerned
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what,
in
your
view,
would
make
this
a
prohibited
transaction?
