justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
long,
with
respect
to
the
catch
all
i've
been
assuming,
and
tell
me
whether
my
assumption's
right,
that
but
for
erisa
and
its
preemptive
effect,
you
would
be
entitled
to
seek
this
kind
of
equitable
remedy
in
a
state
court
under
its
equity
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
the
real
reason...
i
guess
one
of
your
reasons
for
saying
you've
got
to
find
it
in
the
catch
all
here
is
that
it
would
have
been
very
odd
for
congress
in
effect
to
take
away
a
remedy
for
the
benefit
of
the
erisa
beneficiaries
by
preemption
without
allowing
it
under
the
federal
jurisdiction
created
by
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
ms.
brinkmann,
isn't
the...
i'm
searching
for
the
same
thing
that
justices
breyer
and
scalia
are
searching
for,
and
is
the
answer
maybe
simpler
than
we
tend
to
assume?
is
the
answer
to
this
seemingly
ballooning
liability
the
concept
of
the
prohibited
transaction,
so
that
if,
you
know,
they...
the
trustee
buys
lousy
stock,
that's
not
a
prohibited
transaction?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
stock
goes
down,
nobody's
going
to
be
able
to
sue.
i
mean,
is
that
in
effect
the
limitation
that
should
satisfy
us
for
what
we're
worrying
about
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not...
you
don't
win
because
it
was
not
a
prohibited
transaction.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
couldn't
get
back
the
billion
dollars
that
the
employers
made
off
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
how?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
so,
because
if
you
posit
a
common
law
situation
in
which
there...
let's
leave
erisa
out
of
it.
let's
just
assume
you
had
a
state
law
case
to
keep
it
simple.
if
you
assume
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
state
law
that
prohibited
a
transaction,
a
state
equity
court
presumably
would
have
authority
to
award
the
kind
of
relief
that
in
fact
is
being
claimed
here,
and
it
would
do
so,
number
1,
because
there
was
a
state
law
violation
and
number
2,
the
relief
that
it
was
awarding
would
in
fact
be
for
the
benefit
of
those
intended
to
be
benefited
by
the
state
law.
so
what
you're
saying
is,
well,
there's...
nothing
is
being
displaced
here
simply
because
erisa
preempts
any
state
law...
i
think
you're
assuming
that
erisa
preempts
any
state
law
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
benefited
parties.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
nobody's
claiming
it
is.
i
mean,
the
whole
point
here
is
that
there
was...
the
allegation
is
that
there
is
a
breach
of
the
statutory
duty,
and
equity
ought
to
be
in
a
position
in
effect
to
limit
the
harm
by
ordering
restitution
or
rescission.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
gets
us
perhaps
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
but
it...
i
guess
the
bottom
line
of
your
argument
is
the
one
that
came
out
in
your
earlier
answer
to
justice
breyer.
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
people
on
your
theory
in
effect
can
walk
off
with
the
money
and
no
one
can
make
a
direct
claim
in
equity
to
keep
the
money
from
being
dissipated.
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
you
can't
do
it...
you
can't
do
it
under...
in
state
law,
because
there's
preemption.
you
can't
do
it
under
erisa
because,
in
fact,
the
section
does
not
expressly
mention
parties
in
interest
versus
trustees,
and
that's
the
bottom
line,
right?
