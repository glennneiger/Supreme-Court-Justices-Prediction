justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
provision
allows
suit
against
parties
in
interest,
why
wouldn't
it
also
allow
suits
against
persons
who
are
not
parties
in
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
mean,
the
provision
you're
relying
on
doesn't
say,
parties
in
interest.
it
neither
says
fiduciaries
nor
parties
in
interest,
and
if
you're
going
to
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
who
it
says
is
the
defendant,
then
i
guess
we
have
to
say
the
defendants
could
be
anybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
true,
but
those
are
not
the
sections
that
create
the
cause
of
action.
the
section
that
creates
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
say
whom
it's
against.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
says
whom
it's
against.
i
don't
know
why
it
couldn't
be
against
anybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whenever
it's
equitable
to
get
the
money
out
of
somebody's
hide.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
instance
where,
you
know,
the
united
states
code,
or
even
a
state
code,
creates
a
cause
of
action
without
saying
whom
it's
against?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
make
the
point
again.
you're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--502(a)(2)--
justice
antonin
scalia
or
any
person
who's
violated,
so
you
really
think
that
the
best--
justice
antonin
scalia
--reading
of
this
provision
is
that
you
can
bring
the
action
against
anyone,
even
someone
who
has
not
been
in
violation
of
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
doesn't
say
just
constructive...
i
mean,
it's
an
extraordinary,
extraordinary
intent
to
attribute
to
congress,
that
it
essentially
left
it
up
to
the
courts
to
decide
who
is
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
mean,
a
court
could
say,
somebody
who
knew
of
this
violative
transaction,
who
has
no
other
connection
with
the
thing
at
all,
just
knew
about
it
and
did
not
blow
the
whistle,
presumably
a
court
could
say
that
person
should
cough
up
some
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
say
it
doesn't
matter
whether
salomon
brothers
is
a
party
in
interest.
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
that
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
have
a
cause
of
action
under
this
provision
whether
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
up
to
an
administrator
to
bring
that
suit,
and
i'm
willing
to,
and
i
think
justice
breyer
is
willing
to
assume
some
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
or
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
the
treasury
in
bringing
a
lawsuit.
i'm
not
willing
to
assume
good
faith
on
the
part
of
a
private
litigant.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
government's
position,
as
it
is
petitioner's,
that
it
is
not
only
an
interested
person
who
can
be
sued
under
this
provision
but
also
anybody
else,
so
long
as
there's
a
violative...
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
who
says
it
is?
all
it
says
is
appropriate,
appropriate
equitable
relief.
i
guess
a
court
of
equity
can
decide...
i
mean,
i'm
inclined
to
agree
with
you
that
the
easiest
reading
of
the
whole
statute
is
to
assume
that
suit
would
be
allowed
here,
but
i'm...
i
am...
i
think
maybe
we
should
require
something
more
than,
you
know,
well
probably
the
easier
reading
is
this,
in
order
to
make
me
believe
that
congress
enacted
a
provision
that
just
left
it
up
to
the
courts
who
can
be
sued.
i
think
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
here
is
that
it
is
not
just
the
allowance
of
suits
by
private
individuals,
but
it
is
also
an
allowance
of
a
suit
by
the
secretary
herself
for
the
restitution,
which
would
make
the
other
administrative
remedies
that
the
secretary
has
available
in
order
to
coerce
restitution
superfluous.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
hein,
about
the
tax.
is
it
correct
that
the...
as
justice
breyer
assumes,
that
the
100
percent
tax
goes
to
the
fund?
i
thought
it
went
to
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
get
back
to
the
fund?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
tax
equal
to
100
percent
of
the
amount
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
tax.
it
goes
to
the
government,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
government
turn
around
and
give
it
to
the
defrauded--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know,
but
you
have
an
intransigent
object,
and
he
says,
you
know,
i
don't
like
this
fund.
i'd
rather
give
the
money
to
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
he
coughs
up
the
100
percent.
what
happens
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
keeps
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
displacing
any
common
law
liability
if
we
don't
find
liability
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
(a)(3)
cover
the
situation
if
we
find
for
you,
of
payments
that
were
made
excessive?
is
that
an
act
or
practice
which
violates
any
provision
of
the
subchapter?
