mr.
peter
c.
hein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
the
two
statutory
provisions
that
are
at
issue.
the
first,
406,
prohibits
conduct.
by
its
terms,
the
prohibition
is
directed
at
the
fiduciary.
salomon
was
ruled
here
not
to
be
a
fiduciary.
406
says
a
fiduciary
shall
not
cause
the
plan
to
enter
into
particular
transactions.
the
second
statute
at
issue,
502(a)(3),
does
not
prohibit
conduct.
it
does
not,
by
its
terms,
impose--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--sure.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
if
it
was--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that
is
an
issue,
justice
stevens,
that
has
yet
to
be
determined.
i
think
justice
ginsburg
is
correct
that
in
the
current
procedural
posture
of
this
case,
where
we
have
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
right
of
action
at
all,
one
assumes,
arguendo,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--again,
justice
stevens,
with
the
caveat
that
we
will
be
disputing
that
in
the
future--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes,
for
present
purpose--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
at
this
level
we
win
because
there
is
no
prohibition
directed
at
the
counterparty,
whether
it's
a
party
in
interest
or
not.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
the
statute
is
clear.
it
says
a
fiduciary
shall
not.
by
its
terms,
it
does
not
impose
a
prohibition
or
create
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
counterparty,
which
could
be
a
party
in
interest,
or
a
number
of
those
subdivisions
in
section
406
do
not
even
refer
to
party
in
interest
at
all.
if
one
looks
at--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes,
justice
stevens,
those
provisions
do
refer
to
the
party
in
interest,
but
the
entire
section,
406,
prohibited
transactions,
is
structured
to
prohibit
conduct
by
the
fiduciary,
so
in
section
406(a)
there's
a
list
of
prohibitions
that
says
the
fiduciary
shall
not,
and
one
of
those
does
not
even
refer
to
party
in
interest.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
well,
at
the
district
court
level
petitioner's
argument
was
strict
liability.
they've
now
revised
it
to
be
a
knew
or
should
have
known
standard,
and
our
alternative
argument,
which
we
don't
believe
this
court
need
reach,
is
that
if
one
is
going
to
recognize
the
cause
of
action
here,
the
standard
at
least
has
to
be
equal
to
that
in
405(a),
because
congress...
in
section
405(a)
congress
expressed
addressly
the
question
of
whether
or
not
participants
in
fiduciary
breaches
should
have
liability.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
what
we're
saying,
justice
breyer,
is
that
congress
made
a
deliberate
choice,
and
this
was
a
legislative
compromise,
a
legislative
compromise
where
there
would
be
this
administrative
mechanism,
civil
penalties
or
excise
taxes
as
an
administrative
mechanism
that
could
be
pursued
to
obtain
a
correction
or
restitution
from
the--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--well--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--i
think--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--justice
breyer,
let
me
address
you
in
two
ways,
because
i
think
that
the
first
question
that
you're
asking
is,
in
effect,
why
would
congress
have
set
it
up
this
way?
it
was
a
legislative
compromise.
the
house
was
saying
no
party
in
interest
liability
in
civil
suit.
also,
the
house
was
not
proposing
to
have
excise
taxes
or
other
administrative
sanctions
against
a
party
in
interest.
the
senate
wanted
both.
the
senate
bill
provided
for
civil
liability
of
parties
in
interest
both
for
damages
and
for
disgorgement.
the
senate
bill
also
provided
for
an
excise
tax
regime
for
administrative
enforcement,
so
the
senate
wanted
both.
there
was
a
compromise,
and
it's
very
clear
that
what
happened
is
that
the
conference
committee
staff,
and
it's
in
the
appendix,
recommended
that
the
house
position
be
accepted
on
the
issue
of
liability,
that
there
should
not
be
civil
liability
of
parties
in
interest.
however,
congress
did
continue
with
the
excise
tax
provisions
that
the
senate
had
proposed,
providing
an
administrative
sanction.
and
the
government
argues
here
that,
well,
they
need
the
right
to
sue
under
(a)(5)
as
well,
and
that
private
parties
have
to
have
the
right
to
sue
under
(a)(3)
as
well,
but
when
one
thinks
about
it,
the
logical
consequence
here
of
the
government's
position...
because
the
government
says
that
the
excise
tax
and
civil
penalty
mechanism
is
all
set
up
to
procure
the
restitution
of
the
assets
to
the
plan.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
on
the
government's
theory
and
on
petitioner's
theory,
if
you
allow
an
action
under
(a)(3)
for
a
private
party,
or
under
(a)(5)
for
the
secretary
to
compel
the
restitution
directly,
as
opposed
to
going
through
the
administrative
penalty
and
excise
tax
regime
that
congress
provided
for,
if
you
allow
for
the
action
directly,
you
basically
render
superfluous
this
complex
penalty
and
excise
tax
regime
that
congress
arrived
at
as
a
part
of
a
process
of--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes,
but--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--justice
ginsburg,
you're
correct
that
they're
not
inconsistent.
however,
here,
if
one
accepts
the
government's
theory
of
what
the
purpose
of
excise
tax
and
the
penalty
scheme
is,
i.e.
to
force
restitution
to
the
plan
from
the
party
in
interest,
in
effect,
if
they
can
sue
directly
to
compel
that
restitution,
then
this
complex
administrative
scheme
becomes
essentially
superfluous.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
that's
correct,
with
the
caveat
that
you
do
have
the
excise
tax
and
the
civil
penalty
scheme,
and--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that's
i
think
substantially
correct.
there
are
minor
differences
in
the
language
of
the
two
provisions
and,
of
course,
(a)(5)
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
second
part
of--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that
is
correct
in
this
situation.
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
suits
could
be
brought
against
a
nonfiduciary
under
(a)(3).
for
example,
if
an
employer,
acting
as
a
nonfiduciary,
fired
someone
to
deprive
them
of
benefits,
510
of
erisa
says
that
that
is
enforceable
under
502.
potentially
one
could
be
suing
that
employer
under
502(a)(3).
or
one
may
have
a
situation
where
someone
has
violated
the
terms
of
a
plan
by
refusing
to
make
a
reimbursement
to
the
plan
for
medical
expenses
that
they
were
paid
and
then
got
reimbursed
for
in
a
lawsuit,
and
that
suit
may
be
brought
under
(a)(3),
so--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes.
that
is
correct,
and
as
i
said,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
but
there
are
minor
differences
in
the
language
of
the
two
and,
for
example,
a
suit
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
plan
is
under
(a)(3)
but
not
(a)(5),
but
for
purposes
of
this
case
i
think
your
honor's
analysis
is
correct,
that
the
two
are
substantially
comparable.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
under--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--under--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--under
(a)(5),
that
is
correct,
but
of
course
under
(a)(6)
they
can
bring
an
action
to
collect
a
civil
penalty.
they
do
have
a
right
to
pursue
an
administrative
penalty
in
appropriate
cases
involving
welfare
plans,
and
you
have
the
excise
tax
regime
established
to
cover
pension
plans,
so
there
is
a
separate
administrative
mechanism.
the
excise
tax
and
the
civil
penalty
mechanism
is
separate
and
apart
from
suits
under
(a)(5).
mr.
peter
c.
hein
well,
you
could--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--if
you
were
successful
through
the
administrative
mechanism
of
forcing
the
correction,
assuming
that
the
person
who
has
made
off
with
the
money
is
a
party
in
interest.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
this
administrative
mechanism,
is
to
force
the
correction.
that's...
and
this
is...
whether
or
not
it's
elegant,
this
is
what
congress
agreed
to.
this
was
the
deal.
this
is
what
the
house
and
senate
compromised
on,
and
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
eloquence
of
the
arrangement.
i'm
here
to
defend
that
this
was
the
arrangement
they
agreed
upon.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
our
position
is
that
if
salomon,
for
example...
our
position
is,
salomon
is
not
a
party
in
interest.
our
position
is
there's
no
cause
of
action
against
us
under
erisa,
and
we
would
acknowledge,
as
we
did
in
the
seventh
circuit,
that
if
one
accepts
that
we
are
not
a
party
in
interest,
and
that
there's
no
erisa
cause
of
action,
there
would
be
no
preemption
of
state
law
claims.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
then
i
think,
your
honor,
there
may
be
a
closer
question,
because
under
pilot
life
there's
a
recognition
that
congress...
if
congress
set
up
a
remedial
scheme
to
deal
with
parties
in
interest
and
the
remedial
scheme
was
to
rely
on
administrative
enforcement,
the
civil
penalty
and
the
excise
tax,
there
would
be
an
argument,
i
think,
under
pilot
life
that
that
is
exclusive.
there
may
be
an
argument
to
the
contrary
as
well.
this
court
in
mertens
i
think
quite
correctly
said
that
our
job
at
hand
is
to
deal
with
whether
there's
a
right
of
action
or
whether
there's
a
particular
stated
remedy,
whatever
the
preemption
consequences
of
that
decision
may
be
is
for
the
future,
and
that
is
how
the
court
approached
this
problem
in
mertens,
saying
preemption
issues
are
for
the
future.
i
think
that
was
the
proper
analysis.
just
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
in
terms
of
what
would
be
the
logic
in
saying
that
you
can't
sue
the
party
in
interest
in
a
civil
action,
i
think
this
case
illustrates
many
of
the
pitfalls...
apart
from
vindicating
the
congressional
intent,
many
of
the
pitfalls
about
private
suits.
for
example,
if
one
can
sue
under
(a)(3)
you
have
the
specter
of
the
fiduciaries
who
themselves
violated
the
statute,
who
themselves
caused
the
plan
to
enter
into
the
prohibited
transaction,
or
who
knowingly
participated
in
that
conduct,
being
the
ones
who
themselves
are
plaintiffs.
here,
ameritech
corp.,
for
3
years
running
ameritech
corp.
represented
to
the
united
states
government
no
prohibited
transactions,
no
nonexempt
prohibited
transactions.
here,
nisa,
the
investment
manager...
and
salomon
was
not
the
investment
manager.
nisa,
the
investment
manager,
had
an
agreement
with
ameritech
that
it
would
not
knowingly
participate
in
a
prohibited
transaction.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
that
may
be,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
go
back
to
the
fact...
and
this
is
central
here,
that
under
502(a)(3)
there
has
to
be...
and
this
court
indicated
this
in
mertens,
embraced
it
the
next
year
in
central
bank.
there
has
to
be
a
substantive
right
and
duty.
equitable
relief.
relief
is
a
remedy,
and
as
a
remedy
does
not
itself
invoke
a
substantive
right
and
duty,
and
i
think
this
court--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes.
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
proves
my
point.
in
4975
congress
was
explicit
that
there
would
be
an
excise
tax
imposed
on
a
disqualified
person
who
participates
in
a
prohibited
transaction.
congress
knew
how
to
use
the
words,
participate
in
a
prohibited
transaction.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
no,
justice
ginsburg,
because
502(a)(3)
refers
to
violations
of
title
i.
4975
is
part
of
title
ii.
it's
a
separate
tax
section
of
erisa,
so
it
is
not--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--4975
is
a
self
contained
excise
tax
provision,
and
was
established
as
an
excise
tax
provision
quite
deliberately.
that
was
the--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--with
regard
to
certain
parties
in
interest
the
answer
is
yes,
but
it
does
not
create
a
duty
or
a
liability
under
erisa
enforceable
in
suit
under
(a)(3)
and
(a)(5),
both
of
which
are
confined
to
title
i
provisions,
and
4975
in
creating
the
excise
tax
mechanism,
and
yes,
the
secretary
of
treasury
can
go
after
a
disqualified
person,
which
is
most
parties
in
interest,
if
the
other
conditions
of
4975
are
met
to
collect
the
excise
tax.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
4975
excise
tax
administrative
mechanism
of
enforcement--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--relative
to
most
parties
in
interest
who
qualify
as
disqualified
persons
and
to
me
this
proves
our
point,
because,
as
is
evident
from
the
legislative
history,
the
senate
was
proposing
both
the
administrative
mechanism
with
excise
taxes
and
expressly
imposing
a
civil
duty
on
the
party
in
interest.
the
senate
bill--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes.
that--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that's
correct,
because
502(a)(3)
does
not
create
duties
or
liabilities.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
yes.
our
position
would
be
there
must
be
a
substantive
basis
for
liability
for
participation
in
the--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--i
think
that
is
certainly--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
yes.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
i
think,
justice
breyer--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that
may
well
be
getting
to
the
heart
of
it.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
i
think
the
answer--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--the
answer
is,
there
has
to
be
a
threshold
duty
and
liability
under
erisa
to
point
to.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
mertens,
reprised
the
next
year
in
central
bank.
there
has
to
be
this
threshold
duty
and
liability.
where
is
the
duty
and
liability
under
title
i.,
because
it's
only
violations
of
title
i
that
can
be
enforced
under
(a)(3),
so
where
is
the
threshold
duty
and
liability
under
title
i.?
mr.
peter
c.
hein
the
tax--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--justice
scalia,
the
tax
is
the
prospective
sanction--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--yes.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
justice
scalia--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--justice
scalia,
the
scheme
that
congress
came
up
with
was
one
where
this
tax
or
penalty
would
be
used
as
a
lever
by
the
government
to
force
correction.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
then--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--then
the
government--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--the
government
would
keep
it,
and
again--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--i
would
have
two
answers,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is,
i
personally
don't
know.
the
second
is,
i
believe
the
government...
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
and
the
government
in
their
brief
take
the
position
that
very,
very
little
tax
revenue
is
collected
under
this
provision,
so
i
would
infer
that
if
little
tax
revenue
is
collected,
that
it
is
very,
very--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--that
would
be
my--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--justice
breyer,
if
it
does
not
have
its
desired
force
as
the
sanction
to
force
the
correction...
the
whole
theory
of
the
excise
tax
and
civil
penalty
was,
it
would
force
people
to
correct,
and
so
the
plan
would
get
the
money
back,
and
i
might
add
that
the
plan
in
a
situation...
take
this
situation.
the
plan
is
not
without
its
remedies.
if
the
fiduciary
breaches,
there
is
full
recourse
against
that
fiduciary.
if
there's
a
fiduciary
that
knowingly
participates
in
the
breach,
there
is
recourse
against
that
knowing
participant.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
there's
provision
in
erisa
that
a
plan
can
insist
that
it's
fiduciaries
have
insurance.
the
plan
can
itself
buy

it

so
the
fiduciary
would
be
engaged
in
a

act

the
fiduciary
would
be
liable,

if
the

there

here

are

--but
you
can--
mr.
peter
c.

--but
you
could
also
sue
the

and
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
stress
in
this
regard
is,
under
the
common
law
a

could
transact

provider,
with
the
trust,

there
would
not
be
any

there
would
not

this
whole
regime
in

is
a
pure
statutory
creation.
mr.
peter
c.
hein
that's
correct.
that--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--well,
justice
souter,
what
i
was
referring
to
is
here
the
act
of
a
trustee
for
a
trust
dealing
with...
transacting
with
the
service
provider
to
that
trust
was
not
a
breach
by
the
trustee
and
was
not
a
breach
by
the
service
provider
under
the
common
law,
and
i
think
this--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--and
justice
souter,
again
i
would
point
to
this
court's
opinion
in
mertens,
echoed
the
next
year
in
central
bank,
where
this
court
indicated
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantive
duty
and
liability
under
erisa,
that
there
was
no
provision
of
erisa
that
prohibited
participation
in
the
fiduciary
breach--
mr.
peter
c.
hein
--justice
souter,
that's
the
legislative
compromise
that
congress
worked
out
both
as
to
the
enforcement
scheme
as
well
as
its
decision
on
preemption.
