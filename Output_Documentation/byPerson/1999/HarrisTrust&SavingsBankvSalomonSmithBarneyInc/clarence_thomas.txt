no.
99-579,
harris
trust
&
savings
bank
versus
salomon
smith
barney.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
section
406
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act,
erisa,
bars
a
fiduciary
of
an
employee
benefit
plan
from
causing
the
plan
to
engage
in
certain
prohibited
transactions
with
a
party
in
interest,
a
term
which
is
defined
to
encompass
entities
that
a
fiduciary
might
be
inclined
to
favor
at
the
expense
of
the
plan’s
beneficiaries.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
assumption
that
the
ameritech
pension
trust,
an
erisa
plan,
entered
into
a
transaction
prohibited
by
section
406
with
respondent
salomon
smith
barney,
a
non-fiduciary
party
in
interest,
whereby
salomon
received
assets
from
the
plan.
the
plan's
fiduciaries,
petitioners
harris
trust
&
ameritech
corporation
brought
suit
against
salomon
under
section
502(a)(3)
which
authorizes
a
fiduciary
to
bring
a
civil
action
to
obtain
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
violations
of
erisa
title
i.
salomon
moved
for
summary
judgment,
arguing
that
section
502(a)(3)
authorizes
suit
only
against
parties
upon
whom
a
duty
is
expressly
imposed
by
one
of
title
i’s
substantive
provisions,
and
asserting
that
section
406
does
not
expressly
impose
such
a
duty
on
a
nonfiduciary
in
interest.
the
district
court
rejected
this
argument
and
denied
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
while
we
agree
with
salomon
that
section
406
expressly
imposes
a
duty
only
on
a
plan
fiduciary,
and
not
on
a
nonfiduciary
party
in
interest,
we
reject
salomon’s
assumption
that
a
section
502(a)(3)
suit
is
available
only
against
a
defendant
upon
whom
a
duty
is
expressly
imposed
by
one
of
title
i’s
substantive
provisions.
rather,
we
hold
that
section
502(a)(3)
itself
imposes
certain
duties;
in
this
case,
it
imposes
a
duty
on
a
nonfiduciary
party
in
interest
who
has
received
plan
assets
in
violation
of
section
406.
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
the
language
of
section
502(a)(3)
which
authorizes
a
suit
for
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
a
violation
of
title
i,
but
does
not
specify
which
parties
may
be
proper
defendants.
another
provision
of
section
502(l)
confirms
this
conclusion
in
so
far
as
it
contemplates
a
suit
by
the
secretary
of
labor
under
section
502(a)(5)
against
defendants
upon
whom
a
duty
is
not
expressly
imposed
by
one
of
title
i’s
substantive
provisions.
as
we
explained
in
our
decision
in
martin,
section
502(a)(5)
and
section
502(a)(3)
must
be
interpreted
similarly
in
light
of
their
similar
language.
although
section
502(a)(3)
as
noted
does
not
expressly
indicate
who
may
be
a
defendant,
it
does
effectively
impose
certain
limits
by
virtue
of
its
caveat
that
the
retrospective
relief
sought
the
appropriate
equitable
relief.
the
common
law
of
trusts
informs
our
understanding
of
this
phrase,
that
common
law,
a
fiduciary
or
beneficiary
of
a
trust
could
bring
suit
against
a
transferee
for
value
of
planned
assets
that
were
obtained
in
breach
of
the
trust
unless
the
transferee
lack
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
giving
rise
to
the
breach.
here,
the
antecedent
breach
is
a
violation
of
section
406,
and
salomon
received
planned
assets
by
virtue
of
that
transaction.
but
it
remains
to
be
decided
on
remand
whether
salomon
possessed
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
giving
rise
to
the
violation
of
section
406.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
seventh
circuit’s
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
