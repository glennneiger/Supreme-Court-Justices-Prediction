justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you're
right...
what...
the
thing...
i'm
having
trouble
with
the
case,
and
maybe
it's
only
tangentially
relevant,
but
if
you're
right,
i
thought
stockbrokers
are
always
selling
investments
to
people,
and
companies
hire
stockbrokers
and
so
do
plans,
and
why
wouldn't
you
do
this.
if
you
ran
a
plan,
you'd
buy
a
lot
of
investments
and
then
the
ones
that
went
up
you'd
keep,
and
then
as
soon
as
some
went
down
you'd
ask
the
stockbroker
or
the
investment
manager
to
give
you
your
money
back.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
very
good
way
of
running
a
fund.
you
couldn't
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
something
i'm
missing
in
how
this
statute
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
difficulty
is
probably
something
very
basic.
i
don't
understand
how
the...
you
read
the
statute,
and
it
seems
to
say
you
can't
buy
services
from
somebody
who
sells
you
services.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
say
you
can't
buy
computers
from
a
computer
servicing
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
say
you
can't
buy
investments
from
a
stockbroker,
and
yet
i
thought
that's
their
job.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
there's
something
basic
i'm
not
understanding.
what
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
it's
not
relevant,
in
which
case
just
tell
me
that
and
don't
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
salomon
brothers
is
or
is
not
a
party
in
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
part
that
was
worrying
me
about
that
is
that
it
says,
other
services
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
plan,
and
so
i
could
imagine
an
enormous
litigation
growing
up
where
the
plans
are
saying
in
respect
to
a
losing
investment,
well,
the
service
wasn't
actually
necessary,
it
was
sort
of
a
frill,
and
therefore
we
get
back
the
loss
that
we
incurred.
and
where
you
talk
abut
the
other
enforcement
provisions,
it's
the
secretary
doing
it,
so
we
have
a
screen
that
would
screen
out
the
legal
claims
that
are
not
quite
well
founded
and
just
represent
an
effort
to
get
your
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
in
respect
to
that
particularly,
i
guess
that
you
can
buy
an
investment
from
a
broker
dealer
provided
that
a
certain
number
of
conditions
listed
in
the
regulation
are
met.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
those
are
fairly
technical,
and
therefore
we're
asking
the
brokers
and
the
dealers
to
become
erisa
experts,
understand
that
regulation,
and
if
they
get
it
wrong,
it's
not
just
that
the
secretary
might
sue
them.
it's
that
any
fund
would
be
negligent
not
to...
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
literally
negligent,
but
i
mean,
a
fund
would
say,
sure,
let's
sue
and
get
our
money
back.
now,
it's
that
kind
of
highly
technical
thing
in
the
scope
of
the
substantive
duty
that
i
guess
produces
some
concern
about
who
can
enforce
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
isn't
what
you've
just
said
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
i
earlier
raised,
or
that
we
were
talking
about?
that
is
to
say,
if
we
decide
with
you
now
on
this
threshold
issue,
let's
take
a
different
case
and
get
out
of
the
case
the
problem
as
to
whether
you're
a
party
in
interest,
imagine
that
a
fiduciary
or
somebody
else
gives
about
a
billion
dollars
of
the
trust's
assets
to
a
crooked
employer,
and
the
employer
runs
off
with
the
billion,
and
what
the
trustee
would
like
to
do
is
to
get
the
billion
dollars
back
from
the
employer,
who's
in
mexico,
or
wherever.
now,
you're
saying
that
congress
didn't
want
that
to
happen.
well,
i
mean,
that's...
why
not?
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
like
basic
laws
of
any
trust,
et
cetera,
so
you
take
the
assets
of
the
trust,
you
run
off
with
them.
what
you've
done
is
unlawful.
you
gave
it
to
your
cousin.
he
was
knowing.
you
get
it
back
from
the
cousin.
so
why
would
we
interpret
this
to
be
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
congress
not
have
wanted
to
follow
the
more
elementary
sort
of
law
of
getting
assets
back
for
trusts
in
this
kind
of
situation,
where
we
get
out
of
the
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
party
at
interest
issue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
we
focus
on
a
clear
case
where
there
really
is
a
party
in
interest
and
they
shouldn't
have
done
it
and
so
forth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
understanding...
i
just
want
to
be...
what
seems
to
me
the
bottom
line
of
this,
of
what
you're
saying
is,
if
you're
right
and
we...
it
doesn't
matter
in
terms
of
getting
money
back
from
the
party
in
interest,
because
the
secretary
can
get
the
money
back
by
suing
under
the
provision
that
you
and
justice
ginsburg
were
talking
about.
it's
called
a
penalty,
but
it's
100
percent
if
he
doesn't
pay
back
in
a
year,
so
he
can
get
the
money
back.
so
that
helps
you.
that
doesn't
hurt
you.
but
where
it
matters
is,
number
1,
if
you
want
to
trace
the
assets
further,
you
couldn't
do
it,
and
number
2
is
if
you
want
rescission.
so
what
this
case
really
turns
on
is,
does
the
secretary
and
does
the
trustee
have
the
power,
under
this
statute,
to
get
rescission
and
to
trace
the
assets
beyond
the
party
in
interest
himself?
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
heart
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
the
little...
because
you're
an
expert.
i
know
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
these
extra
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
i
don't
know,
but
i
mean,
is
that
the
heart
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
the
heart
of
it,
then
you
have
a
statute
which
really
doesn't
talk
about
defendants.
it
doesn't
talk
about
them
at
all.
that's,
you
know,
where
they
list
it
in
502(a)(3),
it
just
says
it
may
be
brought.
so
it
must
be
assuming
you
could
bring
this
action
against
somebody,
and
it
just
doesn't
list
defendants,
so
when
we
have
a...
traditional
kind
of
remedies
like
rescission
and
asset
tracing,
and
we
have
a
statute
that
doesn't
mention
defendants
at
all,
why
wouldn't
we
assume
that
traditional
principles
will
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
back
to
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
penalty.
he
means
the
penalty.
that's
good--
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
still
it's
an
important
point,
isn't
it?
because,
in
fact,
i
was
wrong.
in
fact,
if
this
civil
penalty
is
going
to
the
government,
then
if
you're
right
there's
no
legal
way
to
get
the
money
back
to
the
workers.
i
mean,
that's
basically
the
upshot,
isn't
it,
that
i
was
wrong
in
saying
it's
just
tracing.
it's
tracing,
plus
it's
restitution,
plus
it's
the
fact
that
you
can't
get
the
money
they
took
and
gave
to
their
cousins
or
whatever.
you
can't
get
it
back
to
the
workers.
you
get
it
back
to
the
government.
so
that's
three
problems,
not
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
be
reasonable
to
say,
this
is
equitable
relief,
so
in
an
instance
where
the
only
violation
of
this
reg
you
cited
that
makes
it
a
prohibited
transaction
is
a
technical
matter
like
failing
to
keep
adequate
records--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
it
is
not
equitable
to
get
back
the
money?
