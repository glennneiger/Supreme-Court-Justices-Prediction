justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
put
the
choices
between
a
strict
liability
matter
and
the
word
fail,
connoting
fault?
aren't
there
a
lot
of
intermediate
positions?
i
mean,
for
example,
this
provision
might
not
apply
at
all
where
there
is
no
state
proceeding.
suppose
a
state
has
a
rule,
we
don't
have
a
state
proceeding,
all
right.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
them
failing
anything.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
a
lot
of
state
proceedings
where...
state
situations
where
the
state
gives
you
the
possibility
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
there,
if
the
thing
isn't
in
the
record,
and
he
may
have
failed
to
produce
it,
and
the
next
part,
due
diligence
says,
but
wait
a
minute,
if
it
wasn't
his
fault,
the
defendant,
of
course
he's
excused.
i
mean,
that's
the
due
diligence.
so
the
failure
part
takes
out
some
situations,
like
the
situation
where
the
state
doesn't
even
have
a
proceeding,
and
it
talks
about
the
thing,
you
know,
the
possibility
is
there
for
him
to
develop
it,
and
then
the
next
part,
the
due
diligence
part
says,
by
the
way,
he
has
to
have
been
at
fault
here,
otherwise
he's
excused.
i
mean,
that's
how
i
read
the
natural
flow
of
this.
now,
is
that
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
itself
i
thought,
and
read
in
other
briefs
in
earlier
cases,
presents
quite
a
difficult
question
of
interpretation,
and
that's
why
i
was
rather
sorry
to
hear
you
concede
that
point,
since
i
think
lots
of
interpretation
can
go
into
that
particular
provision
as
to
just
what
it
means,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
i
don't
think
this
court
has
considered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
are
you
going
to
have
the
hearing
about
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the
specific
question
was,
are
you
related
to
any
of
the
witnesses?
the
true
answer
is,
no.
it
is
also
true
that
she
was
married
to
one
of
the
secondary
witnesses
14
years
earlier,
all
right?
those
are
the
facts,
as
i
understand
them.
what
fact
further
do
you
want
to
develop?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
you
going
to
cross-examine
him
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
know
what
the
relationship
was.
she
was
married
14
years
before
to
one
of
the
secondary
witnesses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
anther
possibility
would
be
if
the...
they
had
a
full
hearing,
and
there's
a
finding,
but
the
finding
is
clearly
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
that's
a
classic
situation
under
townsend,
where
the
federal
court
will
grant
a
hearing,
and
i
thought
possibly
in
such
a
circumstance
this
whole
section
doesn't
apply,
because
it
is
a
reason
for
giving
a
hearing,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
failure
of
someone,
the
plaintiff,
so
i
thought
there
were
a
number
of
townsend-type
situations
where
this
whole
section
didn't
apply,
but
not
yours.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you
that...
maybe
i'm
being
repetitive
here,
but
i...
you've
now...
i
agree
with
you
that
these
words,
if
the
appellant
has
failed
to
develop
a
factual
record,
don't
simply
mean
there
are
no
facts
somewhere
in
the
state.
there
are
a
lot
of
situations,
i
think
at
least
several
i
can
think
of,
where
the
absence
of
a
factual
record
in
the
state
doesn't
mean
he
failed
to
develop
it.
now,
you
agree
with
that,
i
take
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
i've
said
that,
but
then
rely
upon
the
later
thing,
due
diligence,
to
bring
in
the
question
of
who's
at
fault
for
there
not
being
a
factual
record,
where
fault
is
relevant,
which
is
in
a
subset
of
the
total
absence
cases,
now
does
that
produce
bizarre
results?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
give
me
an
example,
because
that's
what
would
be
very
helpful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
see
why
you're
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
so
how
does
it
produce
an
odd
result
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you've
really
showed,
you
know,
if
there's
a
factual
issue
as
to
whether
that
report
was
in
the
record
or
not
in
the
record,
i
guess
you'd
get
a
hearing
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
not
in
the
record
it's
not
the
fault
of
the
plaintiff,
and
if
it
is
in
the
record,
it
is
the
fault
of
the
plaintiff...
of
the
defendant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
in
this
particular
case
there's
no
rule
of
virginia
law
that
barred
him
from
producing
that
psychiatric
report
within
60
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
failed
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
he
failed
to
do
it,
so
the
statute
applies,
and
now
the
question
is,
did
he
exercise
due
diligence,
and
you
say,
of
course
you
failed
to
exercise
due
diligence.
the
report
was
right
in
the
record.
all
you
had
to
do
was
look
at
the
file.
and
he
says,
my
lawyer
signed
an
affidavit
which
says
he
looked
through
the
file,
and
if
it
had
been
there
he
would
have
seen
it.
okay.
that
sounds
like
a
pure
factual
dispute,
so
why
don't
we
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
to
resolve
what
happened
with
the
document
that
one
side
says
was
in
the
file,
and
the
other
side
says
wasn't,
okay,
so
the
judge
believes
one
side
or
the
other
side?
why
doesn't
that
require
a
hearing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
wait.
i'm
sorry.
didn't
we
grant
cert
not
on
the
meaning
of
this
last
phrase,
which
is
a
kind
of
harmless
error
phrase,
but
rather,
i
didn't
see
anywhere
where
we
are
supposed
to
interpret
this
section
about
the
people,
the
facts
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
for
constitutional
error
no
reasonable
fact-finder
would
have
found
the
applicant
guilty.
now,
if,
in
fact,
we're
supposed
to
interpret
that,
i'd
like
to
get
briefs
on
what
that
means,
but
i
thought
what
we
granted
cert
on
was
the
meaning
of
the
first
part,
failed
to
develop,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
reading
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
talks
about
the
failed
to
develop,
and
the
state
suppressed
relevant
facts,
and
does
that
require
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
i
see
nothing
in
that
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
third
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
received
in
the
case
that
justice
souter
wrote
many
briefs,
and
in
those
briefs
i
found
considerable
disagreement
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
last
phrase.
that's
why
i
don't
know
that
we
should
decide
it
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
i
understand
your
point.
the
point
is
that
why
didn't
the
state
counsel,
or
the
state
habeas
counsel
go
and
ask
two
jurors?
if
he'd
asked
two
jurors
he
would
have
found
out
the
same
thing.
all
right.
but
what
about
the
other
one
where
you
have
the
state
habeas
counsel
saying
the
psychiatric
report
was
not
in
the
record,
in
effect.
i
know
the
exact
words.
and
the
other
side
says
yes,
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
he
supposed
to
look
at
the...
i
don't
know,
is
he
familiar
with
the
different
persons,
who's
a
codefendant,
sentencing,
transcript...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you...
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what's
bothering
me
about
the
third
part,
the
part
about
the
standard
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
et
cetera,
and
that
i
take
it
is
what's
putting
the
pressure
on
the
word
fail,
on
his
side
of
it.
suppose
a
case
has
some
evidence
against
the
defendant,
but
much
of
the
evidence
consists
of
his
own
confession,
and
suppose
it
turns
out
later,
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
much
later,
too
late
for
a
state
hearing,
we
suddenly
get
a
videotape
and
the
confession
was
beaten
out
of
him,
all
right.
what's
supposed
to
happen?
now,
that's
what's
bothering
me.
do
you
see
the
problem?
i
mean,
would
it
even
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is...
because
now,
you
read
the
literal
words
of
that
third
part,
and
those
literal
words
seem
to
say
that
the
defendant
loses
in
that
circumstance,
and
that's
why
i
say
i'm
not
sure
they
mean
what
they
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
there
be
a
constitutional
problem,
and
that
same
problem
i
guess
is
here,
but
with
the
word
failure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
a
constitutional
problem
in
the
case
i
put?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
according
to
what
he
just
read,
it
says
according
to
medical
evidence
presented,
any
of
the
three
gunshot
wounds...
any...
could
have
been
potentially
lethal,
and
all
three
definitely
contributed
to
his
death,
with
a
lot
of
citations,
so
what
is
the
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no--
