mr.
john
j.
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
petitioner,
terry
williams,
who
appeals
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversing
a
united
states
court
district
judgment
which
granted
williams
a
new
sentencing
hearing
because
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
his
trial.
the
petition
presents
two
issues,
the
first,
was
williams
prejudiced
as
that
term
is
defined
in
strickland
v.
washington,
by
the
undisputed
failure
of
his
counsel
to
investigate
and
present
available
and
compelling
mitigation
evidence?
the
second
is,
if
williams
was
prejudiced
by
that
failure,
must
an
article
iii
court,
including
this
court,
nevertheless
deny
habeas
corpus
relief
because
section
2254(d)(1)
of
title
28
compels
it
to
defer
to
an
erroneous
legal
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
on
the
strickland
v.
washington
issue?
williams'
position
on
the
first
issue
is
that
the
experienced
state
trial
judge
and
the
experience
district
court
judge
correctly
applied
the
strickland
prejudice
standard
to
the
undisputed
facts
respecting
counsel's
deficient
performance.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
the
seven
experienced
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
committed
legal
error.
the
two
trial
judges
got
it
right.
with
respect
to
the
second
issue,
williams'
position
is
that
section
2254(d)(1),
properly
interpreted,
does
not
require
the
entry
of
a
judgment
by
an
article
iii
court
inconsistent
with
the
constitutional
law
pronounced
by
this
court
simply
because
a
state
court
entered
such
a
judgment.
the
language
of
section
2254(d)(1)
did
not,
indeed
could
not
constitutionally
require
this
court
to
enter
a
judgment
inconsistent
with
its
own
view
of
constitutional
law.
now,
if
i
may,
mr.--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
reasonable
application
that
is
nevertheless
an
incorrect
application
of
the
law
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
what
courts
do.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
if
unreasonable
application
means
erroneous
application
in
the
view
of
five
members
of
this
court,
then
the
decision
should
not
stand
as
a
bar
to
habeas
corpus
relief.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
(d)(1)
in
effect
codified
the
teague
standards.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
justice
souter.
it...
the
contrary-to
language
in
2254(d)(1)
seems
to
me
refers
to
the
selection
of
the
wrong
legal
standard,
and
as
i
read
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
they
all
agree
that
when
the
state
court
chooses
the
wrong
legal
standard,
there's
plenary
review.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
read
the
clause
as
one
whole
clause
dealing
with
legal
error.
factual
errors
are
dealt
with
in
the
next
provision,
in
2254(d)(2),
so
what
the
court
is...
what
the
congress
is
saying
in
(d)(1)
is
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application,
in
other
words,
wrong
within
the
ordinary
scope
of
review
rendered
to
decisions
of
state
courts
by
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
if
you
read
the
whole
clause,
justice
scalia,
it
refers
to
contrary
to
clearly
established
law
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
and--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--no.
i'm
saying
that
what
the
statute
does
is
codify
the
old
law
rule
of
teague,
with
this
qualification,
that
under
teague
you
could
look
to
old
law
established,
for
example,
in
the
circuit
courts,
but
under
this
statute
congress
has
said
you
can't,
but
that
issue
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
if
congress
meant
that
you
can't
decide
the
case
because
in
the
view
of,
say,
one
justice
strickland
v.
washington
didn't
clearly
establish
something,
that
seems
to
me
to
put
you
right
within
city
of
boerne
against...
whatever
the
name,
the
case
where
you
have
that
rfra
was
unconstitutional.
it's
a
case
of
congress
telling
this
court
how
to
decide
an
issue
of
constitutional
law--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--and
congress
never
intended
that.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that
is
my
position,
justice
ginsburg.
this...
in
this
case,
strickland
is
a
clearly
established
rule,
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
departed
from
it.
that
should
end
the
inquiry.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
now,
of
course,
virginia
suggests
that
that's
not
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
did,
that
it
actually
applied
strickland.
i
suggest
that
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
fairly,
that's
not
what
it
did.
but
even
if
that
were
the
case,
even
if
it
were
an
application
of
strickland,
choosing
the
right
rule,
the
question
then
would
be,
what
is
your
rule
in
reviewing
that
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
if
i'm
right
that
virginia
simply
chose
the
wrong
governing
standard,
chose
the
rule
against
perpetuities
instead
of
strickland
v.
washington,
that
ends
the
inquiry.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
but
you'd
have
to
go
further--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--well,
if...
only
if
the
majority
of
you
agree
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
chose
the
right
rule.
i
don't
think
you
can
fairly
read
that
opinion
in
that
way.
but
if
you
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
applied
the
right
rule,
since
strickland
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
you
must
exercise
plenary
review.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
there
is
a
debate
between
the
parties
on
that,
and
i
don't
think
it's
much
of
a
debate,
because
i
don't
think
you
can
fairly
read
lockhart
as
across-the-board
modifying
strickland.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
and
that's--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--let's
assume
they
did--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--the
supreme
court
of
virginia
relied
on
lockhart.
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
section
2254(d)(1)
to
hold
that
if
any
justice
or
any
judge
could
imagine
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
was
right,
2254(d)(1)
requires
a
denial
of
habeas
corpus
relief,
and
i
suggest
that
is
simply
a
misreading
of
congressional
intention.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
reasonable
room
for
disagreement
among
judges
with
respect
to
a
rule
of
law,
or
the
application
of
a
rule
of
law
to
undisputed
facts.
justice
scalia,
i
suggest
that
that's
not
what
judges
do.
law
professors
talk
about
pure
questions
of
law,
but
judges
enter
judgments,
and
sometimes
they're
not
unanimous,
and
if
congress
were
to
tell
you
in,
for
example,
in
exercising
your
section
1257
jurisdiction,
reviewing
a
state
court
judgment,
that
you
can
only
reverse
a
state
court
judgment
if
you're
unanimous,
i
am
confident
that
a
majority
of
you
would
say,
congress
has
violated
separation
of
powers.
you
can't
tell
the
judge
that.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
it
means,
justice
scalia,
what
you
said
in
teague.
it
means
that
old
rules
that
are
settled
must
be
followed.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
new
rules
need
not
be,
and
the
clearly
established
reference
is
simply
to
the
old
rule,
new
rule
distinction.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
the
language
chosen...
reasonable
application,
and
clearly
established
and
so
forth...
you
find
in
the
teague
line
of
cases,
and
i'll
grant
you
that
this
is
not
a
model
of
clear
statutory
draftsmanship,
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
president
looked
at
it,
and
in
his
signing
statement
interpreted
it,
he
read
it
to
mean
what
we
suggest,
that
it
did
not
affect
the
ability
of
this
court,
or
any
article
iii
court,
to
decide
a
pure
question
of
law
or
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
all
constitutional
law.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
your
honor,
considering
the
amount
of
time
and
space
that
this
court
has
devoted
to
the
presentment
clause,
it
seems...
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
surprising
not
to
treat
a
presidential
signing
statement
as
a
significant
piece
of
legislative
history.
the
president
was
a
participant
in
the
legislative
process.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
no,
not...
well,
i
take
that
back.
i
think
i
could
probably
refer
you
to
a
law
review
article
that
collects
some
case
law,
but
i
cannot
refer
you
to
a
case
where
this
court
has
specifically
addressed--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--well--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--well,
that
hypothetical,
of
course,
is
not
this
case,
because
there
are
no
committee
reports.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
there
is
no
significant
evidence
that
that
was
the
case,
and
the
signing--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--statement
refers
to
the
fact
that
some
people
make
that
contention--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--and
he
said
no,
that's
wrong.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
your
honor.
the
house
version
would
have
gone
much
further
and
might
even
have
achieved,
at
least
from
a
point
of
view
of
a
statute,
the...
what
virginia
contends
for,
but
that
version
was
rejected,
and
this
language
is
clearly
a
compromise.
now,
there's
no...
nothing
new
or
startling
about
compromises
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
statutes.
in
the
49
years
that
i've
been
at
the
bar,
one
side
or
the
other,
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
there
wasn't
somebody
in
congress
trying
to
repeal
the
1867
habeas
corpus
statute,
and
the
whole
history
of
it
is
compromise,
and
this
is
another
compromise,
and
you
simply
should
not
attribute
to
congress
an
intention
to
tell
an
article
iii
court
how
to
decide
an
issue
of
constitutional
law,
because
there
are
enough
lawyers
in
congress
who
know
that
they
can't
do
that,
and
that
is
precisely
what
virginia
is
contending.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
if
you
read
this
as
a
jurisdictional
statute,
you
could
reach
that
conclusion.
i
don't
contend
that
congress
could
not
abolish
the
1867
habeas
corpus
statute.
it
could
abolish
section
1257,
it
could
abolish
section
1331,
but
that's
not
what
congress
did.
you
have
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
squarely
the
question
presented
in
klein
and
in
city
of
boerne.
can
congress,
in
a
case
where
you
undoubtedly
have
jurisdiction,
tell
you
how
to
decide
an
issue
of
constitutional
law?
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
if
you
mean,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
congress
can
tell
you
to
abandon
your
historic
practice
of
deciding
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law
like
plenary
review,
i
suggest
no.
i
realize
that
you
joined
in
an
opinion
at
least
hinting
otherwise.
[laughter]
but
i
suggest
that--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--you're
wrong.
[laughter]
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
there
are
four
things
that
courts
do.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
and--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--well,
for
example,
when
congress,
or
in
this
case
a
rule
of
court
approved
by
congress,
tells
you
when
a
petition
for
certiorari
is
timely,
congress
isn't
telling
you
how
to
decide
a
case.
it's
telling
you,
no,
you
can't
decide
the
case.
that's
jurisdiction.
when
congress--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--you
could
have
taken
it
on
review
of
this...
the
virginia
decision,
and
if
you
had,
under
section
1257,
at
least
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
have
reversed
because
virginia
misapplied
the
governing...
chose
the
wrong
governing
precedent.
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
tell
you
you
can
decide
a
case
one
way
in
section
12...
in
a
section
1257
review,
but
you
must
decide
it
another
way
in
a
section
1254
review,
and
i
suggest
to
you,
congress
didn't
intend
that,
because
congress
couldn't
get
away
with
that.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
it
has
to
some
extent,
but
in
this
instance
the
issue
is
before
you,
you
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
it,
and
you
must.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
if
congress
added
that
to
the
present
limitation
on
review
of
facts,
that
would
be
the
equivalent,
justice
souter,
of
a
repeal
of
habeas
corpus,
but
that's
not
what
congress
did.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
when
congress...
well,
there
are
two
questions.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
i'll
address
the
last
ones
first.
when
congress
used
the
word
decision,
it
obviously
referred
to
judgment,
because
that's
what
courts
do
when
the
court
makes
a
decision.
it
can't
make
a
decision
other
than
in
connection
with
a
judgment,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
read
anything
into
decision
other
than
that.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
what
plenary
review
means,
yes,
but
of
course,
that's
not
where
you're
going
to
go
with
this
case,
because
this
case
satisfies
the
strickland
test.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
it
would
be
a
basis
for
habeas
relief
if
habeas
relief
is
properly
available,
and
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
and
if
you
were
to
independently
conclude
that
the
virginia
trial
court
and
the
district
court,
both
of
whom
found
the
strickland
violation
were
wrong,
yes,
i'd
lose,
or
my
client,
mr.
williams,
would
lose,
but
that
i
don't
think
is
likely,
given
this
record.
i
don't
think
it's
the
least
bit
likely.
your
honor,
i
see
my
white
light
is
on.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
may
it
please
the
court:
with
respect
to
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
decided,
i
refer
you
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
444,
443
and
carry
on
to
444,
where
it...
the
court
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
is
applying
strickland
plus.
it
says,
the
court--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--the
virginia
trial
court
erred.
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
444.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
the
end
of
the
opinion.
the
court
makes
it
perfectly
clear
it's
reversing
the
virginia
trial
court
because
the
virginia
trial
court
applied
the
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
outcome
test
announced
in
strickland.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
but
the
previous
paragraph
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
error
that
it
identified
was
the
trial
court's
error
in
using
the
strickland
test.
the
court
makes
it
clear
that
something
else
in
virginia
is
required,
and
that
was
legal
error.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
if
you
read
that
in
the
context
of
the
trial
court's
decision,
yes,
it's
wrong,
because
what
the
trial
court
looked
at
was
the
fact
that
the
virginia
legislature
had
opted
for
a
scheme
in
which
the
jury
must
be
unanimous
before
it
can
impose
death.
what
else
is
that,
except
the
reasonable
probability
that
the
jury
will
not
be
unanimous,
and
the
court
says,
that's
a
per
se
rule.
well,
it's
the
per
se
rule
adopted
by
the
virginia
legislature.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
exactly
what
the
virginia
court
held,
and
that's
legal
error.
now--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--no,
that
would
be
fretwell.
that
would
be
a--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--no--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--failure
of
adequate
performance
by
counsel
in
investigating
and
presenting
something
that
the
petitioner
was
legally
entitled
to--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--not
something
the
petition--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--yes,
right.
