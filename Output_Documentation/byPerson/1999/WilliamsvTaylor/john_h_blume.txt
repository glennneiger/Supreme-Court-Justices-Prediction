mr.
john
h.
blume
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client,
michael
wayne
williams,
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
in
mr.
williams'
case,
this
court
is
confronted
with
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
the
applicant
failed
to
develop,
in
section
2254(e)(2)
of
the
antiterrorism
&
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996,
or
aedpa.
this
morning,
i
intend
to
first
discuss
why
the
strict
liability
interpretation
of
(e)(2)
offered
by
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
is
wrong,
second,
offer
a
more
plausible
interpretation
of
(e)(2)
which
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
language,
the
decision
of
this
court
from
which
the
language
was
borrowed,
other
provisions
in
aedpa
and
the
incentive
structures
underlying
aedpa
and,
third,
demonstrate
why
my
client
is
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
under
the
appropriate
standard.
in
any
case
of
statutory
construction,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
this
inquiry
should
begin
with
an
examination
of
the
language
itself,
and
the
relevant
part
of
2254(e)(2)
for
our
case
reads,
if
the
applicant
has
failed
to
develop
the
factual
basis
of
a
claim
in
state
court
proceedings,
the
court
shall
not
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
claim
unless
the
applicant
shows
that
the
claim
relies
on
either...
and
now
i'm
paraphrasing...
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law,
a
factual
predicate
that
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
accompanied
by
a
showing
of
innocence,
or
a
clear
and
convincing
demonstration
that
no
rational
fact-finder
would
have
found
the
applicant
guilty
of
the
underlying
offense.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
seems
that
if
congress
were
drafting
a
strict
liability
statute
it
would
not
likely
have
chosen
the
language
of
(e)(2),
if
the
applicant
has
failed
to
develop
the
facts.
a
strict
liability
statute,
or
a
statute
which
did
not
care
whose
fault
it
was,
would
say
something
like,
if
the
facts
were
not
developed
in
a
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
mean,
facts
conceivably
could
be
developed
by
either
side,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
claim,
or
whether
there's
an
evidentiary--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes.
i
mean,
often
that
is
the
case.
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
claims,
the
applicant
will,
but
the
phrase,
if
the
applicant
has
failed
to
develop
the
facts,
seems
to
indicate,
clearly
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
applicant
must
somehow
be
at
fault.
a
strict
liability--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
mean,
in
some
situations
it
is.
in
many
usages,
and
i
think
the
most
common
usage,
failed
denotes
some
type
of
fault,
some
expectation
left
undone,
and
it
seems
if
you
tether
failed
with
the
applicant,
if
the
applicant
failed
to
develop,
that
certainly
seems
to
encompass,
i
think,
some
type
of
fault.
a
strict
liability
statute
is
often
worded
much
differently.
i
mean,
a
strict
liability
statute
you
would
think
most
plausibly
say,
if
the
facts
were
not
developed,
which
was
a
usage
which
was
in
play
in
habeas
before
this
under
the
old
townsend
five.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i...
justice
kennedy,
that
really--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
language
itself,
if
the
applicant
has
failed
to
develop,
that
looks
at
the
conduct
of
counsel,
what
did
counsel
do?
the
exception,
the
factual
predicate
that
could
not
have
previously
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
looks
at
the
character
of
the
evidence.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
rule
and
the
exception
envisions
a
situation
in
which
the
applicant
did
fail,
did
leave
something
left
undone,
didn't
reasonably
develop
the
facts,
but
nevertheless
is
able
to
demonstrate
that
even
if
he
or
she
had
acted
with
due
diligence
they
would
not
have
discovered
the
evidence.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
think
it
is,
because...
for
several
reasons.
one,
that
would
for
all
practical
purpose
eliminate
hearings
in
most
cases
even
when
the
applicant
did
absolutely
nothing
wrong,
because
the
due
diligence
under
this
language
has
to
be
accompanied
by
a
clear
and
convincing
demonstration
of
innocence.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but
i
think
logically
to
fail
to
develop
would
envision,
both
in
its
language
and
in
its
usage...
i
mean,
keeney
v.
tamayas-reyes
is
where
this
came
from,
i
think
most
logically.
it's
hard
to
say
it
just
did
not
come
out
of
keeney,
where
keeney
used
this
exact
formulation,
did
the
person
fail
to
develop,
and
keeney
was
clearly
talking
about
situations
in
which
the
applicant
failed,
was
negligent,
in
which
the
applicant
did
not
take
advantage
of
opportunities
to
develop
the
facts
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
and
this
is
the
language
that
congress
chose.
to
some--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no.
the
claim
would
be
barred
under
virginia
law
at
the
time
it
was
discovered.
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--virginia
has
a
strictly
applied
harsh
21-day
rule,
that
any
newly
discovered
evidence
not
presented
within
21
days
of
conviction
is
not
cognizable.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
correct.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
it's
one
of
the
harshest
newly
discovered
evidence
rules
in
the
country,
so
there
is
no...
but
that
does
raise
the
question.
i
mean,
i
think
certainly
the
aedpa
wants
people
to,
as
did
this
court's
decisions
prior
to
that,
to
exhaust
their
claims
in
state
court,
to
encourage--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
not
only
will
they
not
permit,
but
if
you
look
at
the
character
and
the
nature
of
the
claims
in
this
case,
they
are
withholding
claims,
evidence
where
the
petitioner
alleges
the
facts
were
within
the
possession
and
control
of
the
state
and
were
not
disclosed,
despite
a
pretrial
motion
which
requested
this
type
of
information.
they
were
required
to
respond.
they
did
not
produce
the
report.
they
did
not...
and
there
were
discussions
about
the
deal.
mr.
john
h.
blume
there
are
actually
three
claims,
justice
o'connor.
one
has
to
do
with
the
psychiatric
report
of
the
testifying
witness,
mr.
cruse,
which
was
inconsistent,
completely
inconsistent
with
the
trial
testimony.
the
second
claim
has
to
do
with--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
was
in
a
file
some
place.
i
mean,
that
is
a
question
of
dispute
which
would
probably
have
to
be
resolved
at
a
hearing.
when
was
it
put
in
the
file?
was
it
taken
out
of
the
file?
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
mean...
okay,
no
basis
for
discovery
before.
on
the
juror
question,
what
happened
there,
i
mean,
that
was
a
question
in
which
the
jury
was
asked
a
question,
are
you
related
to
anyone.
the
chief
investigating
officer
in
the
case
was
her
ex-husband.
now,
she
was
also
asked
if
she
had
ever
been
represented
by
any
of
the
attorneys
in
the
case,
including
the
prosecutor
in
the
case,
mr.
woodson,
and
she
answered
no.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
mean,
first
of
all,
to
answer
the...
to
go
back,
there
were
requests
for
more
specific
questions
which
were
denied.
this
is
the
only
question
the
trial
court
would
allow
in
this
particular
case,
but
i
just
think
it's
a
very
hypertechnical
view
of
the
term,
related.
now...
as
it
is
represented.
i
mean,
i
try
cases,
and
i
was
trying
to
think
about
it.
if
i
were
sitting
in
a
case,
a
trial,
my
defense
investigator
had
used
to
have
been
married
to
a
juror,
and
i
didn't
say
anything
when
the
judge
said,
is
somebody
related,
and
i
had
represented
them
in
a
divorce
and
i
didn't
say
anything,
i'd
venture
to
say
if
that
came
out,
i
would
probably
go
to
jail
at
the
end
of
that
trial.
i'd
certainly
be
fined.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
part
of
that,
of
course,
your
honor,
is
because
we've
never
had
a
hearing.
the
facts
have
been
alleged.
the
facts
are
true
that
she
was
asked
the
question
and
she
didn't
answer
it.
the
prosecutor
was
in
the
courtroom,
presumably
would
have
known
the
answers
were
false
and
said
nothing.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
assuming
that
we
can
not
only
prove
that,
but
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
juror
bias,
actual
juror
bias
and
implied
bias,
the
remedy
has
always
been
a
hearing,
and
a
hearing
at
which
a
judge
makes
a
determination
of
whether
this
juror
is
biased
or
not,
looking
at
the
witness'
credibility,
what
they
say--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
would
be
on
these
answers,
on
whether--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--there...
presumably
i
would
think
on
cross-examination
both
of
the
prosecutor
and
the--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--you
would
ask
questions
about,
you
know,
what
was
your
relationship,
what
did
you
know--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and...
well,
the
question
is
one
ultimately
of
bias.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
there
were
two
questions,
have
you
ever
been
represented
by
any--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and
she
had
been
represented
in
the
divorce
by
the
prosecutor,
and
the
questions
of
relationship.
the
two
together
certainly
raise
an
inference
this
juror
is
potentially
biased.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
case.
in
this
case,
what
makes
this
an
unusual
situation,
sort
of
not
your
typical
juror
misconduct
claim,
is
that
the
questions
were
asked
in
the
presence
of
the
prosecutor
and
he
sat
silent
when
he
knew
that
the
answers
weren't
true.
mr.
john
h.
blume
and
that
makes
this
different.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
it
certainly
is
true
that
she
had
been
represented
by
the
prosecutor.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
he
was
the
lawyer
in
their
divorce.
i
mean,
that
is
true.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
had
been
about
10
years,
i
think,
before
the
trial,
that
she
was
married
to
this
man--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
but
i
don't
see
how,
under...
anyone
could
say
that
he
had
not
represented
her.
mr.
john
h.
blume
he
had
been
the
lawyer
in
the
divorce.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
his
answer
was
he
didn't
recall
it.
she
said,
well,
i
didn't
really
consider
that
being
represented,
but
those
are
the
types
of
questions
i
think
you
would
ask,
and
more,
on
a
hearing
on
juror
bias.
it's
the
allegations
themselves,
but
what
they
might
give
rise
to,
and
the
questions
at
the
end
of
the
day,
is
the
untruthful
answer,
or
the
inaccurate
answer,
or
the
misleading
answer
some
evidence
of
bias
in
the
case.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it
depends
on
what
state
court
proceeding
means.
if
you
interpret
state
court
proceeding
to
mean
an
evidentiary
hearing,
i
mean,
that
is
a
question.
if
you
interpret--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--state
court
proceedings...
if
a
state
does
not
have,
for
example,
post
conviction,
if
they
do
away
with
post
conviction--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--then
i
would
think
this
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
john
h.
blume
unless
you
just
say...
you
could.
now,
it
depends.
if
you
take
the
absolute
strictest
of
the
strict
liability
interpretations,
which
may
be
something
the
attorney
general's
advancing,
then
it
would
still
be
your
fault,
even
though
there
weren't
state
court
proceedings,
the
facts
aren't
developed,
and
you're
in
federal
court.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
(e)(1)
might
conceivably
cover
that
situation.
i
just--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
just
seems
if
you
read
the
language,
fail
to
develop,
it
doesn't
make
sense,
i
don't
think,
in
the
context
as
a
whole
to
say
that
this
applies
even
where
the
petitioner
did
absolutely
nothing
wrong,
even
where
the
petitioner
tried
to
develop
the
facts,
took
advantage
of
every
opportunity,
and
it
would
also
lead
to
absurd
results.
it
would
mean,
if
that's
true,
that
it's
easier
to
have
the
merits
of
a
claim
in
a
second
petition
under
what...
the
successor
would
have
been
easier...
than
it
is
to
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
federal
court
in
the
first
petition
if
that...
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense.
mr.
john
h.
blume
because
under
the
successor
provision
you
only
have
to
show
either
a
new
rule
of
law
to
have
your
claim
heard,
or
you
have
to
show
due
diligence
and
innocence
in
a
case.
that's
what
it
says.
so
it
means
it
would
be
easier
to
have
a
second
petition
merits
heard
than
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
first
petition.
what
sense
does
that
make?
it
also
means
that
if...
what
happens
in
a
case
where
the
claims
are
procedurally
defaulted,
they
are
held
to
be
procedurally
defaulted
by
the
state
court?
the
person
comes
into
federal
court,
is
able
to
establish
cause
in
prejudice
for
the
default.
if
this
is
a
strict
liability
statute,
then
a
federal
court
can't
hold
a
hearing.
the
person
has...
they
failed
to
develop
the
facts
in
state
court.
they're
able
to
show
that's
what
it
would
mean.
if
it...
it
would
mean
they
could
show...
they
could
overcome
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
state
interference,
the
state
impediment.
the
statute
of
limitations
says
you
toll
from
there.
they
would
be
able
to
overcome
procedural
default,
even
if
they
can
show
it's
not
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground,
or
they
can
establish
cause
in
prejudice,
but
yet
they
cannot
have
a
federal
hearing
because
they
failed
to
develop
the
facts.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
it
would
mean,
justice
scalia,
that
in
many
cases
claims
would
be
properly
before
the
court
on
the
merits--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--and
the
court
could
not
obtain
the
facts
necessary
to
decide
it,
but
this
court
has
always
said
that
if
you
look
at
a
state's
comity
and
federalism
interests,
they
are
much
more
potentially
damaged
or
in
play
by
a
court
entertaining
the
merits
of
the
claim.
once
the
court
decided
to
reach
the
merits,
their
interest
in
comity
and
federalism
are
significantly
less
advanced
by
a
federal
court
hearing
the
facts
necessary
to
accurately
decide
the
issue,
and
it
would
mean,
if
this
is
true,
that
in
many
cases
courts
before
the
court...
issues
before
a
federal
court,
properly
on
the
merits,
the
court's
hands
would
be
tied,
and
that
just...
it
seems
to
make
no...
it
just
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
would
still
be
a
very...
well,
a
situation,
for
example,
in
this
case,
in
which
there
is
a
report,
a
psychiatric
report,
it
contradicts
a
witness,
they
filed
a
brady
motion,
they've
asked
for
it--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--they
didn't
get
it.
they
asked
again
in
state
court--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
don't
see--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
guess
it's--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
think
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical
that
i
have,
justice
breyer,
is,
i'm
still
unclear
what
you
mean
by
failed
to
develop.
i
think
that
the
natural
reading
of
it,
especially
in
light
of
keeney,
is,
it
has
to
have...
some
component
of
the
inadequate
record
has
to
be
fairly
attributable
to
the
petitioner.
i
just
think
this
exception
is
thinking
about
something
else,
a
case
where
you
tried,
but
nevertheless
were...
or
you
failed,
you
didn't
try
but
you
were
able
to
establish
that
you
couldn't
have
discovered
it.
you
didn't
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities,
but
nevertheless
you're
able
to
show
the
witness
was
out
of
the
country,
beyond
the
subpoena
power,
whatever.
even
if
you
had
acted
with
due
diligence
you
couldn't
have
found
the
evidence.
the
facts
were--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes.
he
did
it
on
the
basis,
justice
ginsburg,
of
an
inaccurate
review
of
the
facts,
and
before
he
had
the
affidavit
of
state
habeas
counsel.
the
question
really
was,
what
happened
with...
i
know
this
is
a
confusing
case
because
you
have
three
claims
where
things
came
in
and
out
at
different
times,
but
the
short
version
on
the
psychiatric
report
is
that
it
was
eventually
discovered
in
federal
habeas.
it
was
brought
as
a
brady
claim
because
the
commonwealth
would
have
had
possession
of
this
4
months
prior
to
trial.
it
was
done
4
months
prior
to
trial.
judge
merhige
said...
they
said
they
found
it
in
the
state...
in
cruse's
file,
and
judge
merhige
said,
well,
since
you
found
it
in
the
file,
you
haven't
shown
why
it
wasn't
found
previously.
they
came
back
with
an
affidavit
from
state
habeas
counsel
which
said,
look,
i
went,
i
looked
in
the
file.
when
i...
i
don't
remember
seeing
this
report
when
i
looked
in
the
file.
however,
given
its
contents,
i
am
confident
that
i
would
have
seen
it
had
it
been
there,
and
i
think
that's
clearly
supported
by
everything
else.
this
was
the
type
of
information
he
was
looking
for.
he
made
a
specific
request
to
mr.
curry
for
psychiatric
reports,
which
they
were
told
they
had
complied
with
brady
at
trial
and
they
didn't
have
any
obligation
to
give
them
anything.
mr.
john
h.
blume
of
course...
well,
nobody
can
ever
say
that--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--definitively,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i...
i
mean,
maybe
it
is
sort
of
lawyer
talk
and
all
that.
i
think
what
he's...
but
his
language
is,
i
am
confident
that
had
it
been
there,
i
would
have
seen
it.
that's
the
language.
if
there
are
unresolved
questions
about
that,
then
those
are
the
types
of
issues
you
resolve
at
a
hearing.
i
mean,
the
very
nature
of
files
is
things
come
in,
things
go
out.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
rather
than
me--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes.
he
said,
i'm
confident
that
i
would
remember
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it's
on...
it's
j.a.
625-626,
when
he
says,
i
have
no
recollection
of
seeing
this
report
in
mr.
cruse's
court
file
when
i
examined
the
file.
given
the
contents
of
the
report,
i
am
confident
that
i
would
remember
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
and
that...
i
mean,
that
certainly
seems
supported
by
everything.
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
information
he
was
trying
to
get.
trial
counsel
was
trying
to
get.
he'd
made
requests
to
get
it,
and
these
are
the
type...
if
there
are
unresolved
questions
about
that,
then
those
are
the
types
of
things
that
are
resolved
at
a
federal
hearing,
which
is
where
we
were,
and
that's
where
this
case
got
off-track.
the
district
court
had
ordered
a
hearing.
it
was
getting
ready
to
happen.
the
commonwealth
took
an
emergency
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit.
they
sent
it...
they
said
no,
the
district
court
applied
the
wrong
standard.
all
we
want,
and
what
i
think
my
client
is
absolutely
entitled
to,
is
for
this
court
to
say
that
(e)(2)
is
not
a
strict
liability
interpretation,
to
recognize
i
think
on
the
plain
language
that
it
is
not
a
no-fault,
that
it
has
to
be
somehow
attributable
to
petitioner,
then
send
us
back
to
the
district
court
and
let
us
start
over,
where
we
should
have
been
before,
with
an
appropriate
view
of
what
this
statute
means.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
blume
a
lot
of
ground.
that's...
under
virginia
law,
on
michael
williams'
own
testimony,
he
is
not
guilty
of
capital
murder.
that
is
clear.
the
medical
examiner's
testimony
could
not
clearly
resolve
the
issue
of
whether
this
was
a
fatal
wound
or
not.
you
can
look
at
it,
they
can
describe
it
all
they
want,
but
just
look
at
it.
was
this
lethal?
i
can't
say.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law,
and
in
this
case
the
shot
that
most
recently
mr.
williams
fired
was
not...
the
medical
examiner
could
not
say--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--could
not
say--
[laughter]
--that
was
a
lethal
wound,
so
he's
not
guilty
of
capital
murder
on
his
testimony,
on
its
own
face,
that's
the
point.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
just--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
the
answer
is,
the
medical
examiner
had
sort
of
an
unusual
view
of
contributory,
and
she
said
any
wound
is
contributory.
she
was
asked
specifically
about
the...
there
were
two
headwounds
through
the
brain,
one
into
the
face.
she
said
the
two
brains
were
definitely
potentially
lethal
in
and
of
themselves.
they
went
through
the
brain.
on
this
one
she
said...
or
she
said,
i
can't
tell.
that
was
the
answer.
was
this
a
lethal
wound?
she
said,
i
cannot
tell,
and
that
creates
at
a
minimum
a
jury
issue
on
the
question,
based
upon
the
jury
instructions
that
they
were
given,
and
certainly
means...
and
the
important
thing,
the
answer
to
that
is,
when...
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claim
brought,
just
capital
murder
conviction
on
direct
appeal.
the
virginia
supreme
court
didn't
say,
mr.
williams
is
guilty
on
his
own
testimony.
they
went
straight
to
cruse's
testimony,
and
that's
what
they
relied
upon.
on
the
deal
claim,
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
to
say
that,
well,
on
state
court
they
decided
and
you
lose,
i
mean,
that's
preposterous.
why
was
that
true?
because
they
hid
cruse
out.
they
wouldn't
even
tell
state
habeas
counsel
where
he
was.
they
wouldn't
let
him
interview
him.
he
filed
a
motion
for
discovery,
he
filed
a
motion
for
an
expert,
he
filed
a
motion
for
a
hearing.
they
said
no.
the
question
about
representation,
mr.
curry
said...
they
asked
him
about
the
psych
reports
and
the
other
things
and
he
said,
michael
williams
filed
a
lengthy
request
for
exculpatory
evidence
prior
to
trial,
and
the
commonwealth
responded
to
the
request
at
that
time.
what
else
did
that
mean
to
you
but,
you
asked
for
this
type
of
information
at
trial,
we
gave
it
to
you,
you
got
everything
you
were
supposed
to
get.
it's
in
the
j.a.
at
353.
but
the
deal
and
the
psych
report
together,
and
that's
the
way
i
understand
you
look
at
brady
claims,
cumulatively,
would
have
dramatically
undermined
cruse's
testimony.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
this
case
was
about
who
do
you
believe.
do
you
believe
cruse,
or
do
you
believe
williams?
mr.
john
h.
blume
the
medical
evidence
didn't
answer
it,
the
ballistics
evidence
didn't
answer
it,
and
that
was
why
this
was--
