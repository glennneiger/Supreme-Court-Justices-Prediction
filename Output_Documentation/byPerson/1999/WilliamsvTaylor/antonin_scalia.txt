justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
isn't
of
bias.
it's
whether
she
misrepresented
in
a
response
to
the
question,
and
you
have
to
support
the
position
that
if
you
married
someone
and
divorced
them
you're
still
related
to
them.
i
mean,
what
if
she
had
gone
out
with
the
man
14
years
ago,
and
hadn't
married
him.
would
you
still
say,
well,
you
know,
she's
related
to
him?
i
guess
in
some
sense
she
is
related
to
him.
she
went
out
with
him
14
years
ago.
but
how
can
you
possibly
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
blume,
can
i
come
back
to
the
text
of
the
statute
we
were
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
is
to
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
posed.
that
is
to
say,
suppose
there
simply
has
not
been
a
state
proceeding
at
all.
does
that
mean
that
this
whole
subsection
does
not
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
this
wouldn't
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
wrong
with
that?
i
mean,
the
rule
is,
the
only
time
we're
going
to
give
federal
evidentiary
hearings
is
if
there's
either
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
asserted,
or
a
factual
predicate
that
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered
exists,
and
there's
evidence
that
no
reasonable
fact-finder
could
have
found
this
defendant
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
he
just
say,
it
was
not
there?
it's
a
very
guarded
affidavit.
he
could
have
written
an
affidavit
that
said,
i
looked
in
the
file.
it
was
not
there.
he
didn't
say
that,
did
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure
you
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
i
looked
it
in
and
it
was
not
there.
why
can't
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
did
he
also
say,
i
am
confident
that
i
would
remember
having
seen
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
in
order
to
get
to
your
ultimate
conclusion
you
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
remember
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
i
would
remember
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
trial
procedure
was
unconstitutional,
in
other
words,
in
the
context
of
a
claim--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
what
the
claim
is
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
60
days
after
denial
of
cert.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
curry,
as
i
read--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
i
the
question,
it's
whether
2254(e)(2)
governs
petitioner's
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
govern
petitioner's
claims,
the
claims
made
here,
if,
indeed,
that
last
portion
of
(e)(2)
requires
that
he
show
a
probability
of
innocence.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
i
hold
up
a
grocery
store
with
a
cohort
and
we
both
shoot,
and
unless
the
state
can
show
that
it
was
my
shot
that
caused
the
death,
i
can't
be
convicted
of
capital
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
always
go
in
with
a
cohort,
then.
