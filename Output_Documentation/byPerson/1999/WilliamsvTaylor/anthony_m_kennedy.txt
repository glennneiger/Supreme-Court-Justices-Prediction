if
you're
correct
in
your
interpretation,
what
function,
other
than
surplusage,
does
(2)(a)(ii)
have,
which
says
that
a
factual
predicate
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
just
kind
of
write
that
out
of
the
statute
as
surplusage?

the
williams
versus
taylor
opinion
that
i
am
going
to
announce
is
99-6615.
the
similarity
in
the
names
presents
a
coincidence
that
will
do
nothing
but
confuse.
in
this
williams
versus
taylor,
99-6615,
a
virginia
jury
convicted
the
petitioner
michael
wayne
williams
of
two
capital
murders,
williams
received
a
death
sentence.
he
later
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court
and
requested
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
certain
constitutional
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
in
agreement
with
the
united
states
district
court,
ruled
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
these
claims
in
his
federal
habeas
action.
the
petitioner’s
execution
was
about
to
go
forward
and
we
issued
a
stay
order
on
the
evening
of
the
punishment
being
carried
out.
we
then
granted
certiorari
to
determine
the
correct
statutory
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
which
controls
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
may
receive
the
hearing
on
his
claims.
the
provision
at
issue
is
consist
of
one
sentence
in
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996.
the
sentece
is
the
first
sentence
in
28
u.s.c.
2254(e)(2).
in
effect,
the
sentence
says
that
an
evidentiary
hearing,
as
a
general
rule,
is
not
permitted
in
a
federal
habeas
action,
if
the
habeas
applicant
has
failed
to
develop
the
factual
basis
of
the
claim
in
state
court,
and
the
relevant
phrase
that
we
must
concentrate
upon
is
"has
failed
to
develop
the
factual
basis".
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
attempted
to
present
to
the
united
states
district
court
three
claims
that
had
not
been
a
subject
of
the
state
court
evidentiary
hearing.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
urges
that
whatever
the
reason
for
not
developing
the
claims
in
the
state
court,
the
fact
is,
there
was
no
such
development.
in
this
sense,
the
commonwealth
argues
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
develop
a
factual
basis
for
its
constitutional
arguments
and
as
a
consequence,
the
statute
(according
to
the
commonwealth)
bars
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
federal
court.
this
is
a
no
fault
interpretation
of
the
statute,
we
do
not
agree
with
it.
we
conclude
that
congress
used
the
word
“fail”
in
the
sense
of
saying
that
a
person
has
not
taken
the
necessary
steps
to
develop
his
claims
by
reason
of
some
omission
or
fault
or
negligence
on
his
part.
this
is
the
sense
we
hold
in
which
congress
has
used
the
phrase
“failed
to
develop
the
factual
basis
of
the
claim”.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case,
like
every
other
court
of
appeals
which
has
interpreted
the
statute,
agreed
with
this
interpretation.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
entirely
correct
however
in
how
it
applied
the
standard.
we
do
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
petitioner
did
not
exercise
the
necessary
diligence
with
reference
to
a
claim
regarding
the
prosecution’s
alleged
non-disclosure
of
his
accomplice’s
psychiatric
report.
as
to
petitioner's
two
other
claims
which
involved
allegations
of
juror
bias
and
prosecutorial
misconduct
however.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
application
of
the
diligence
standard.
we
hold
that
petitioner
was
diligent
in
his
efforts
to
develop
the
facts
underlying
these
two
claims.
the
statute
therefore
erects
no
bar
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
these
matters
in
united
states
district
court.
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
