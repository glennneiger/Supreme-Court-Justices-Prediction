justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
blume,
i
wondered
if
the
language
directs
us
to
some
kind
of
an
exhaustion
requirement,
trying
to
make
sure
that
state...
people
convicted
in
state
proceedings
try
to
raise
their
claims
first
in
state
court
and
get
the
facts
developed.
it
could
possibly,
i
think,
have
that
meaning.
has
your
client
attempted
to
raise
this
juror
problem
in
the
virginia
courts
and
develop
it
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
that?
is
there
no
post
conviction
proceeding
in
virginia
for
newly
discovered
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
it's
discovered
after
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
it's
very
helpful
to
have
the
facts
developed
in
the
state
courts,
and
i
wondered
whether
that
wasn't
what
congress
was
trying
to
impose
here,
some
kind
of
exhaustion
requirement.
i
don't
know
how
that
should
play
out
in
a
circumstance
as
you
allege,
that
a
state
won't
permit
any
development,
so
it
would
be
futile.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
talking
about
the
juror
now,
and
the
relationship
with
the
deputy
sheriff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
presumably
that
report
was
in
the
file
some
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
frankly
was
more
concerned
with
evidence
that
was
newly
discovered,
and
no
basis
for
discovery
before.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
i
ask
about
virginia
law,
whether
if
there
is
newly
discovered
evidence
that
could
potentially
be
exculpatory,
that
is
discovered
more
than
21
days
after
the
conviction,
does
virginia
bar
any
proceeding
in
virginia
courts
to
determine
the
fact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
was
the
21-day
point
that
counsel
was
making?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
there
is
newly
discovered
evidence
that
comes...
is
discovered
after
that
initial
21-day
period,
are
state
collateral
proceedings
available
to
establish
the
facts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
mean,
a
claim?
the
claim
is,
i'm
entitled
to
have
this
evidence
brought
out
so
that
i
can
have
a
new
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
he
claims
the
conviction
was
obtained
unconstitutionally
because
of
juror
bias.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
can
he
establish
that
in
virginia--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--after
the
21
days?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well...
well,
look--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
now,
mr.
curry,
i
thought
that
a
majority
of
the
federal
circuits
to
have
interpreted
this
very
section,
(e)(2),
have
articulated
some
kind
of
a
fault
requirement,
if
you
will,
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you,
if
we
think
they're
right,
and
if
we
were
to
opt
for
what
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held,
then
could
this
applicant
have
developed
a
factual
basis
in
state
proceedings
in
virginia?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
here
it
was
alleged
this
morning
that
the
juror
in
question
was
asked
if
anyone
had
represented
her
and
she
said
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
she
was
under
oath
at
that
time,
i
assume,
to
tell
the
truth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
any
event
it
looks
like
there
might
be
some
factual
concern
here.
was
there
a
proceeding
available
in
virginia
whereby
this
defendant,
post
conviction,
could
have
determined...
had
the
facts
determined?
