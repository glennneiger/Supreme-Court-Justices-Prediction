justice
david
h.
souter
so
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
there
a
60-day
rule
on
cut-off
for
filing
constitutional
claims?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
just...
you
mentioned
that
he
does
not
have
to
file
his
claim
for
60
days.
is
there
a
cut-off
after
60
days?
justice
david
h.
souter
--he
also
has
another
way
of
getting
out
from
under
it,
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
word
fail
is
importing
a
fault
requirement
as
against,
as
he
characterizes
it,
your
position,
a
kind
of
strict
liability
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is...
to
what
extent
are
you
advancing
a
strict
liability
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
and
i'm
not...
and
i
am,
in
fact,
not
suggesting
that
we've
got
this
case
before
us,
but
i
want
to
take
an
extreme
case
for
the
sake
of
argument.
let's
assume
that
we've
got
a
case
in
which
by
any
standards,
including
those
of
state
law,
there
should
have
been
discovery
allowed
at
the
state
post
conviction
proceeding,
but
the
state
opposed
discovery
and
the
trial
court
didn't
order
it
and,
as
a
result
of
that,
there
were,
in
fact,
all
sorts
of
evidentiary
materials
that
never
got
into
the
record.
what
did
get
into
the
record
did
not
entitle
the
individual
to
any
state
post
conviction
relief,
so
he
now
comes
into
federal
court.
do
you
say
that
in
that
situation
his
record
fails
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
to
develop
the
facts?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
you
are
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
seems
to
me
is
that
in
any
state...
the
way
you
want
us
to
read
the
statute
means
that
in
any
state
post
conviction
case
if
the
prosecution,
let's
say
with
bad
faith
succeeds
in
opposing
discovery
and
therefore
thwarts
the
development
of
the
record,
there
never
can
be
federal
relief
even
when
it's
appropriate
on
federal
law,
except
for
a
prisoner
who
can
prove
the
innocence
that
is
required
under
the
last
subsection,
which
as
a
practical
matter
means
we
would
be
construing
aedpa
to
read
federal
habeas
right
out
of
the
law
in
any
bad
faith
case
except
for
an
innocent
prisoner.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
congress
intended
what
i
just
laid
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
no
federal
habeas,
even
when
federal
law
would
grant
relief
and
even
when
the
state
is
at
fault
for
thwarting
discovery,
unless
the
prisoner
is
innocent?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
in
effect
assuming
that
our
cause
requirement
for
the
override
of
a
default
was
a
cause
requirement
which
would
ignore
the
fact
that
a
prisoner
in
this
case,
in
my
hypothetical,
was
wrongfully
denied
an
opportunity
to
make
a
factual
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
wouldn't
have
been
cause,
and
you're
saying
it's
not
cause...
it's
not
fault
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
could
have
been
satisfied
with
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
and
due
diligence
in
fact
was
expended.
the
reason
it
wasn't
is
not
that
it
couldn't
have
been,
but
because
it
was
wrongfully
opposed
by
the
state,
or
at
least
wrongfully
thwarted
by
discovery
rules.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but...
you
know,
i
recognize
that
fault
can
be
read
either
way.
if
we
were
simply
faced
with
the
word
fault,
i
would
not
find
that
word
dispositive.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
of
my
concerns,
though,
is
that
if
we
read
fault
your
way,
we
are
in
fact
going
to
be
providing
that
in
a
class
of
cases
there
can
be
no
federal
habeas,
despite
entitlement
under
federal
constitutional
law,
except
for
innocent
prisoners,
and
that
is...
that
would
be
a
good
reason
for
reading
it
the
petitioner's
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
they
simply
provide
that
there
would
be
no
federal
habeas
except
for
innocent
prisoners?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
difference
does
it
make,
if
only
innocent
prisoners
get
habeas?
who
cares
whether
they're
diligent
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they're
innocent,
fine.
if
they're
not
innocent,
we
don't
care--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
the
question...
i
mean,
i
think
what
started
all
of
this
line
of
questioning
off
was
the
assumption
that
fault
in
the
statute
does
refer
to
some
failing
rather
than
kind
of
a
strict...
a
failure
of
diligence
rather
than
a
strict,
mere
failing,
and
the
question
that
i
think
justice
stevens
raised
is,
given
the
fact
that
the
voir
dire
question
was
raised
in
open
court,
the
juror
did
not
respond,
and
the
prosecutor
did
not
respond,
could
defense
counsel
have
been
at
fault
for
failing
to
investigate
further
into
the
counsel
relationship?
is
your
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
at
this
stage
we
can
say
state
habeas
counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
state
habeas
counsel
entitled
to
rely
on
that
statement
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
they
may
have
asked
for
investigators--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
they
wanted
to
go
further--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
are
you
saying
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
silence
of
the
record--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
purposes
of...
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it
may...
you
know,
it
may
or
may
not
ultimately
be
helpful
on
brady
if
he
gets
to
it,
but
i
just
wanted
to
follow
justice
breyer's
question
with
this,
and
i
may
be
wrong
on
this.
just
correct
me
if
i
am.
i
thought
the
reason
we
were...
or
there
was
an
argument
over
whether
the
report
was
in
the
file
or
not
was
this:
that
he
had
said,
i
should
have
gotten
the
report,
and
the
response
was,
not
that
you
were
on
inquiry
notice
to
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
find
it.
i
thought
the
response
was,
the
report
was
in
the
file,
and
if
it
was
in
the
file,
quite
obviously
you
were
at
fault.
is
that
the
reason
we're
arguing
over
whether
it
is
or
is
not
in
the
file?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
is,
i
thought
the
state's
response
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--ultimately
to
the
brady
request,
it
was
in
the
file--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
the
brady
issue
turned
down
to
a
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
or
was
not
in
the
file.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
wrong?
