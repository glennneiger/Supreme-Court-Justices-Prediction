justice
john
paul
stevens
--wasn't
she
also
asked
whether
she'd
been
represented
by
anybody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
prosecutor
represented
her
in
the
divorce,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
filed
with
the
virginia
supreme
court,
is
it?
that's
the
way
he
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
they're
the
ones
who
order
discovery,
if
it's
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
isn't
interviewing
the
juror,
it's
interviewing
the
prosecutor,
who
was
the
trial...
who
was
counsel
for
this
woman
during
the
divorce.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
asked
him...
when
in
an
open
court
there's
a
question
raised
as
to
whether
anybody
on
the
jury
has
been
represented
by
one
of
the
lawyers
and
there's
no
answer,
they
are
supposed
to
go
ask
the
prosecutor,
did
you
or
did
you
not
represent
any
juror?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
what
you
say
they
had
a
duty
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
was
the
failure
on
their
part
to
find
out
about
this
representation
before?
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
no,
no.
no.
it's
the
lawyer,
the
prosecutor
who
had
represented
her
and
was
silent
in
response
to
that
question
in
open
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
trouble
you
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
would
be
evidence--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
would
be
evidence
to
support
it
if
the
psychiatric
report
had
been
available,
would
there
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
if
it
were
clear
from
that
report
that
the...
cruse
could
not
have
intelligently
given
the
testimony
he
did
based
on
his
own
recollection,
it
would
raise
a
strong
inference
that
he
did
so
pursuant
to
an
agreement
with
the
prosecutor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
understand
the
psychiatric
report,
it
was
that
he
was
not
in
condition
to
have
remembered
everything
he
testified
to.
isn't
that
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
clear
recollection
he
displayed
at
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
don't
you
think
there's
some
tensions
between
the
two,
between
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
no,
no.
doesn't
it
have
some...
isn't
there
some
inconsistency
between
the
substance
of
that
report
and
the
nature
of
his
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
that
then
not
give
rise
to
an
inference
that
perhaps
there
was
some
understanding
with
the
prosecutor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
other
question
about
your
opening
remarks.
you
recited
all
the
things
that
he
acknowledged.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that,
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law,
if
he
fired
just
one
shot,
which
he
admitted,
and
that
shot
was
not
fatal,
would
he
have
been
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
if
that
one
shot
did
not
cause
the
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
me
directly.
if
the
evidence
showed
that
he
fired
one
shot
that
hit
the
person,
but
that
shot
did
not
cause
the
death,
would
he
have
been
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
troubles
me,
if
that's
right,
the
whole
case
is
a
tempest
in
a
teapot,
because
no
matter
what
happens,
you
win,
if
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
amazing,
because
the
understanding
i
had
of
the
virginia
law
aspect
of
the
case
through
all
the
judges
that
reviewed
it
up
to
now
was
that
if
he's
right
that
he
just
fired
one
shot
and
that
shot
was
not
fatal,
he's
not
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that
predicate
is
wrong,
you
certainly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
also
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
after
a
jury
trial,
the
petitioner
terry
williams
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
virginia
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction
and
sentence.
williams
then
filed
for
collateral
relief
in
state
court
alleging
that
his
trial
counsel
had
been
ineffective,
primarily
because
they
failed
to
present
important
mitigating
evidence
to
the
jury.
the
virginia
trial
judge
who
had
imposed
the
death
sentence
concluded
that
a
new
sentencing
hearing
should
be
held
because
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
of
the
first
trial
would
have
been
different
if
the
mitigating
evidence
had
been
presented
to
the
jury.
the
virginia
supreme
court
disagree,
it
held
that
even
if
counsel’s
performance
were
deficient,
there
was
no
fundamental
unfairness
in
the
sentencing
proceedings.
williams
then
filed
a
petition
for
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
since
the
petition
was
filed
after
the
enactment
of
the
1996
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
which
amended
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
the
district
court
applied
the
amended
version
of
section
2254(d).
the
new
2254(d)
bars
federal
courts
from
granting
habeas
relief
unless
the
state
court
judgment
subject
a
challenge,
“resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to,
or
involved
in
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states."
relying
on
the
standard
that
this
court
stated
in
strickland
against
washington
for
determining
whether
counsel’s
assistance
is
constitutionally
ineffective,
the
federal
trial
court
found
as
had
the
virginia
trial
court
that
counsel’s
performance
well
below
the
reasonable
standard
required
by
the
constitution,
and
that
counsel’s
ineffectiveness
had
prejudiced
the
outcome
of
williams’
sentencing.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
incorrectly
held
that
our
decision
in
lockhart
against
fretwell
modified
the
strickland
standard,
and
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
unreasonably
found
that
the
additional
mitigating
evidence
barely
would
have
altered
the
jury’s
impression
of
williams
character.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
new
2254(d)
prohibited
the
ground
of
habeas
relief
unless
the
state
court
decided
the
question
by
interpreting
or
applying
the
relevant
precedent,
in
this
case
the
standard
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
in
a
manner
that
reasonable
jurists
would
all
agree
is
unreasonable.
under
that
standard
the
appeals
court
found,
it
could
not
say
that
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
was
either
contrary
too
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
the
standard
developed
in
this
court’s
sixth
amendment
case
law.
in
the
decision
filed
with
a
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
denying
williams’
habeas
relief
was
both
contrary
to
and
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court’s
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
court
however
is
divided
about
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
amended
section
2254(d).
the
controlling
opinion
on
that
issue
has
been
filed
by
justice
o’connor.
her
discussion
of
section
2254(d)
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia,
kennedy
and
thomas.
despite
our
disagreement
about
the
precise
meaning
of
that
section
however
the
majority
of
the
court
concludes
that
under
either
standard
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
was
erroneous
and
the
emendate
2254(d)
does
not
foreclose
relief.
the
opinion
that
i
have
filed
has
joined
in
its
entirely
by
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer,
and
in
part
by
justices
o’connor
and
kennedy.
justice
kennedy
joins
all
of
justice
o’connor’s
opinion
and
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
join
her
exposition
of
the
meaning
of
section
2254(d).
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
descending
in
part,
in
which
justices
as
scalia
and
thomas
join.
