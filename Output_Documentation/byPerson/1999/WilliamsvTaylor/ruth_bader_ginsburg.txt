mr.
blume,
can
we
just
back
up
a
bit
before
we
get
to
the
specifics
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
witness?
are
you
suggesting
that
when
you
made
a
request
of
the
state
trial
court,
that
you
would
have
a
right
to
quiz
every
juror?
you
had
no
clue
about
any
of
this
until
an
investigator
happened
to
go
to
the
various
jurors
and
one
of
them
said,
yeah,
that
ms.
stinnett
was
once
married
to
the
sheriff.
but
your...
you
seem
to
be
attributing
some
fault
to
the
state
court
for
the
failure
of
your
client
to
get
at
this
information
earlier,
but
are
you
taking
the
position
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
has
a
right
at
state
expense
to
quiz
all
the
jurors
to
see
if
there's
something
that
was
wrong
in
the
answers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
never
would
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blume,
just
go
back
to
the...
you're
now
focusing
on
the
psychiatric
report,
but
if
i
remember
correctly
judge
merhige
turned
that
one...
ruled
against
you
on
that
one,
didn't
he?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
didn't
have
a
clue
what
they
were
until
the
federal
habeas,
when
an
investigator
quizzed
five
jurors
and
a
couple
of
them
said,
oh
yeah,
she
was
married
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
curry,
we're
now
moving
from
the
argument...
there
was
a
concession
that
if
you
get
to
(e)(2)
the
petitioner
loses,
and
they're
talking
about
only
whether
fault
is
required
in
that
first
part.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
address
the
jury,
and
you
address
the
claimant,
where
merhige
held
in
your
favor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
one
word
has
been
said
about
the
claim
where
merhige
ruled
against
you,
and
so
could
you
address
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
third
objection
that
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
deal
between
the
prosecutor
and
cruse.
