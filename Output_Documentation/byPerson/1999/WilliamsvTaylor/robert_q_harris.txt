mr.
robert
q.
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
congress
has
the
power
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
habeas
corpus
remedy,
and
what
we
see
in
the
act
of
1996
is
congress
taking
substantial
measures
to
change
the
rule,
to
change
the
amount
of
deference
that
is
allowed
to
a
state
court
judgment.
if
i
could
briefly
address
what
congress
said
they
were
doing
in
their
statute
before
moving
on
to
the
specific
statutes,
it
is
clear
from
the
entire
debate
in
congress
that
we
are
talking
about
reform
of
existing
habeas
corpus
law.
it
is
also
clear
that
congress
intended
a
deferential
standard
of
law,
and
we
know
from
the--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--not
specifically.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
wright
v.
west
was
cited
by
the
opponents
of
the
reform
that
were
suggested
in
this
bill
on
the
basis
of
justice
o'connor's
opinion
that
the
federal
courts
should
be
exercising
independent
judgment
over
the
decisions
raised
in
the
federal
habeas
petition.
congress
clearly
was
intending
to
present
a
different
rule.
there
were
specific
references
to
reasonable
applications
of
federal
law
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
by
the
state
courts,
but
if
we
look
at
the
particular
amendments
at
the
very
end
of
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
we
had
senator
kyl
offering
an
amendment
which
would
have
changed
the
standard
we
now
see
and
instead
substituted
an
inadequate
or
ineffective
state
remedy
level,
which
is
roughly
similar
to
the
full
and
fair
standard
that
congress
had
debated
previously.
that
was
rejected.
the
senate
did
not
intend
to
have
that
restrictive
a
standard.
at
the
other
extreme,
senator
biden
offered
an
amendment
which
would
have
deleted
the
standard
of
deference
in
the
statute
altogether,
and
would
have
left
it
as
he
specifically
said,
as
de
novo
review
of
all
the
issues
presented
in
the
case.
that
also
was
rejected.
what
was
left
was
the
standard
which
was
described,
indeed,
as
a
realistic
compromise
between
the
various
points
of
view,
a
middle
level
of
deference,
if
you
will,
between
none
and
absolute.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
your
question
about
the
authority
of
the
president
to
determine
the
legislative
intent
in
his
action
on
the
signing,
i
believe
that
the
rule
is,
where
it
is
an
administration
bill,
and
the
president
is
responsible
for
presenting
the
bill
to
congress
in
the
first
place,
that
his
opinion
on
what
it
means,
it
may
be
given
weight,
but
certainly
when
he
is
merely
offering
an
opinion
on
something
that
congress
has
decided
independently,
his
opinion
is
not
persuasive
of
the
legislative
intent.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
do
not
recall
the
case
off
the
top
of
my
head.
that
is
not
an
issue
that
was,
i
thought,
presented
in
this
case.
the
words
that
we
are
left
with
in
the
1996
act
deal
with
several
statements
that
the
courts
below
have
uniformly
read
as
setting
up
a
deferential
standard
of
review
in
eliminating
the
previous
practice
of
de
novo
review.
clearly
established
law,
as
determined
by
this
court,
is
now
the
law
that
all
courts
must
look
at
in
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
is
a
different
approach
than
congress
has
chosen
to
impose
in
the
past,
certainly
in
the
federal
habeas
context,
but
it's
not--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--and
again,
that
is
in
the
context
of
a
direct
review
system,
and
the
direct
process
of
review
between
the
trial,
the
probable
cause
determination,
the
trial,
and
the
direct
appeal,
but
this
court
has
recognized
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
process
of
direct
review
and
the
process
of
collateral
review.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
true,
but
we
are
now
seeing
in
several
states,
as
anticipated
by
the
capital
case
provisions
of
the
act,
a
process
of
unitary
review,
where
now
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
can
be
raised,
in
addition
to
the
direct
appeal
claims,
in
one
proceeding,
but
still,
as
a
matter
of
course,
most
states
would
follow
the
practice
of
these
competency
claims
being
raised
in
state
collateral
proceedings,
but
still
subject
to
this
court's
review.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
statute
says,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
proponents
of
the
statute
would
have
had
this
court
conclude.
i
think
what
this
statute
is
saying
is
simply
saying
that
the
process
of
direct
review,
of
determining
issues
of
federal
law,
is
adequate,
is
adequate
guidance
for
the
state
courts
to
make
their
own
decisions,
and
their
reasonable
decisions
applying
this
court's
clearly
established
precedent
must
be
honored.
i
think
that's
the
difference,
i
suppose,
on
the
view
of
this
statute
between
williams
and
the
state.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
think
that
the
contrary-to
clause
is
not
addressed
to
determining
that
issue.
that
is
a
question
of
application
of
strickland,
applying
strickland
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
would
be
contrary
to
strickland,
as
the
clearly
established
precedent
of
this
court,
if
the
state
court
failed
to
recognize
and
apply
strickland.
once
the
state
court
has
applied
this
court's
clearly
established
precedent,
it
is
a
matter
to
be
reviewed
for
reasonableness
for
the
result,
the
application
of
the
precedent
to
the
case.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
think
that
would
certainly
satisfy
it,
if
this...
look
back--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
can
understand
that
reading
of
the
statute,
and
it...
that
certainly
is
implicit
in
focusing
on
the
decision
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
don't
think
you
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
you
don't
need
to--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
decision
is
the
adjudication
of
the
facts
and
the
law
of
the
case.
we
have
an
opinion
in
this
case.
we
know
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
said,
both
about
the
law
and
the
facts
presented
by
williams'
case.
i
think
there
may
be
occasions,
if
you
have
a
decision
of
the
state
court--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
cannot
object
to
that
rule,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
congress
was
allowing
a
rule
of
deference,
assuming
the
faithfulness
of
the
state
courts
to
the
clearly
established
precedent
of
this
court.
the
whole
basis
for
allowing
deference
to
the
state
court
decision
is
the
assumption
that
state
courts
are
just
as
good,
and
are
applying
the
correct
law.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
understand
that
reading,
but
i'm
not
certain
the
court
needs
to
go
to
that
point.
i
do
not--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--the
strict
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
strict
reading
of
the
statute,
justice
scalia,
is
certainly
correct.
the
statute
requires
that
decisions,
the
absolute
decision
of
the
court
that
is
not
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
precedent,
may
not--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--as
a
practical--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--as
a
practical
matter,
that
will
be
the
result,
but
because--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--if
the
decision
is
not
contrary,
or
an
unreasonable
application,
no
relief.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
again,
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
go
as
far
as
to
reach
justice
scalia's
question
in
this
case,
and
again,
as
a
practical
result,
if
the
state
court
decision
affirmatively
gives
the
federal
reviewing
court
reason
to
doubt
seriously
whether
or
not
the
state
court
correctly
applied
the
correct
law,
or
unreasonably
applied
the
correct
law,
what
the
court
in
effect
is
doing
is
a
de
novo
review
at
that
point,
and
trying...
and
that...
you
get
to
the
same
point
as
you
would
under
2254(d)'s
contrary-to.
where
the
state
has
affirmatively
failed
to
apply
the
correct
law,
you
would
then
lead
the
federal
court
into
reviewing--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
would
agree
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--that
has
not
been
this
court's
treatment
of
the
objectionable
reasonableness
component
of
teague.
this
court
hasn't
merely
counted
to
see--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--the
fourth
circuit
is
identifying
the
precisely
identical
standard
that
was
applied
by
this
court
in
teague
as
far
as
objective
reasonableness
of
a
state
court
decision.
this
court
has
explained
reasonableness
as
an
objective
standard
on
whether
reasonable
jurists
can
agree.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
think
that
is
the
same
way
of
stating
the
teague
analysis
of
objective
reasonableness,
whether
reasonable
jurists
can
disagree,
and
as
this
court
made--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
i
think
that
this
court's
understanding
of
objective
reasonableness
through
the
teague
cases
is
not
focusing
on
the
particular
jurists
involved.
it's
focusing
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
decision,
and
again,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
a
teague
case,
sometimes
lower
courts
make
serious
mistakes.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
think
congress
has
taken
an
additional
step
beyond
that,
justice
souter,
by...
that...
your
suggestion
that
there
may
be
highly
unusual
particular
cases
outside
the
contrary-to,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
the
unreasonable
applications
here
that
is
going
to
provide
the
gist
of
the
work
for
the
federal
courts.
where
this
court
has
stated
a
specific
rule
for
deciding
federal
claims,
and
the
state
court
has
correctly
identified
and
selected
that
as
the
rule
prior
to
this
petitioner's
claims,
the
only
issue
i
think
the
congress
intended
for
the
courts
is
whether
or
not
that
result,
that
decision
is
a
reasonable
one,
a
reasonable
application
of
this
court's
precedents.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
under
my
understanding
of
2254(d),
it
looks
like
you're
describing
basically
a
teague
issue,
where
you're
simply
looking
at
the
state
court's
choice
of
the
legal
rule
that's
going
to
control
a
claim.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
again--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--if
they
got
the
legal
rule
wrong,
what
this
statute
allows
is,
the
exception
is
met--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--without--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--without
the
addition
of
unreasonable
application,
i
think
this
court
would
be
left
and
federal
courts
would
be
left
with
the
authority
to
disagree
with
the
application
of
the--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--decision
clearly
does
mean
decision.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
think
what
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
congress
has
given
us
both,
because
congress
intended
both
to
have
an
operative
effect
in
this
statute.
i
think
what
we
also
need
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
ordinary
usage
of
the
contrary-to
in
this
type
of
situation
is
the
law
identification,
and
the
unreasonable
application
quite
clearly
places
a
responsibility
on
the
court,
the
federal
court
reviewing
it,
to
apply
the
law.
i
would
point
out
in
addition
to...
on
this
issue
that
williams
has
actually
offered
this
court
an
interpretation
of
2254(d)
that
would
have
this
court
conclude
that
after
the
extensive
debates
on
the
standard
of
review,
after
considering
various
amendments
on
the
standard
of
review,
and
after,
indeed,
considering
every
statement
that
was
made,
that
congress
has
done
nothing
at
all.
his
opinion
is
that
this
statute
is
limited
to
teague
and
nothing
but
teague,
as
if
congress
basically
had
not
acted
at
all.
that
clearly
cannot
be
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
and
i
think
clearly
congress
has
brought
in
what
teague
would
have
given
as
a
judge-made
rule.
congress
has
now
made
it
part
of
the
statute,
but
congress
clearly
has--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
congress
said
they
were
reforming
existing
law,
and
it's
a
nullity
in
that
sense,
if
you
say
it
does
no
more
than
codify
existing
law.
now,
if
i
could
address
for
a
moment
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
pick
the
right
law,
williams'
argument
in
front
of
this
court
is
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
erred.
it
simply
erred
in
referring
at
all
to
lockhart
v.
fretwell
in
addition
to
the
strickland
v.
washington
decision,
and
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
supreme
court
opinion
that
they
conducted
a
strickland
analysis
of
the
claims
that
were
raised
in
this
case.
they
correctly
identified
strickland
as
the
controlling
rule,
they
identified
the
strickland
standard,
they
applied
the
strickland
standard,
and
they
clearly
repeatedly
said
that
williams
had
not
shown
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
outcome
in
this
case,
which
was--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
to
the
last
point
of
that
question,
what
the
trial
judge
said
in
this
case
was
to
define
reasonable
probability
in
a
way
that
is
simply
incorrect.
the
trial
judge--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
the
trial
judge
said,
in
a
capital
case
mitigating
evidence
is
important,
and
if
it's
not
offered,
it
is
prejudice.
the
trial
judge
made
a
very
short
and
simple
per
se
rule
that
if
mitigation
evidence
can
be
identified
in
a
later
proceeding--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--looking
in
the
appendix
at
page
424--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--424.
it's
volume
2
of
the
appendix.
i'll
simply
read
it:
counsel's
failure
to
present
favorable
mitigation
evidence
which
was
available
upon
investigation
and
development
falls
below
the
range
expected
of
reasonable
professional
counsel.
because
this
evidence
is
so
crucial,
it
is
prejudicial
to
a
defendant
when
it
is
not
presented.
if
you
look
down
at
the
following
paragraph,
he
says,
this
court
believes
this
is
the
case.
terry
williams
needed
anything
and
everything.
anything
less
is
not
enough.
that
is
simply
describing
a
per
se
standard
that
is
not
the
strickland
standard.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
if
i
could
look
back,
then,
at
those
particular
facts,
what
trial
counsel
did
in
this
case
is
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
strickland
and
in
berger
v.
kemp
as
what
counsel
do.
they
talk
to
their
client,
they
talk
to
the
client's
family
members,
and
in
this
case,
as
in
those,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
was
anything
particular
in
his
background
to
present
to
the
jury.
trial
counsel
did
have
a
psychiatric
evaluation
done
of
his
client.
he
made--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
even
if
we
assume
that,
then,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
what
he
has
shown
is
prejudicial
to
the...
under
the
strickland
standard,
i
would
say
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
got
it
right.
at
this
point
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
trial
court
and
the
habeas
court
made
findings
on
what
evidence
was
available,
what
should
have
been
presented.
among
other
things,
the
state
court...
no
court
that
has
reviewed
this
case
has
ever
suggested
that
the
opinion
of
dr.
santora,
as
far
as
williams'
dangerousness
in
prison,
was
a
factor
worth
considering
at
all.
it
has
never
been
identified
as
a
factor.
all
the
trial
court
identified
in
the
habeas
as
worthy
of
a
jury's
consideration
was
the
testimony
of
additional
character
witnesses.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
trial
court,
and
he
indicated
that
there
was
other
evidence
was
available
that
reasonable
counsel
could
have
investigated
and
looked
at
to
determine
if
additional
mitigation
evidence
could
be
developed.
but
what
the
habeas
court
relied
on
in
its
findings
was
particular
testimony
of
particular
witnesses,
which
i
would
suggest
is
not
that
different
from
the
witnesses,
the
character
witnesses
that
trial
counsel
in
fact
had
presented
in
the
sentencing
phase
of
this
trial.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
trial
court
made
a
reference
to
documents
where
trial
counsel
could
have
investigated
those
documents
to
determine
if
reasonable...
to
determine
if
reasonable...
not
reasonable,
determine
if
mitigating
evidence
could
be
developed.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it's
a
given.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
is
assumed
for
the
sake
of
this
case,
but
records--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--the
courts...
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
reviewing
this
case...
and,
of
course,
the
fourth
circuit
also
agreed
as
a
de
novo
decision
in
this
case
that
he
had
not
met
the
strickland
standard
of
prejudice.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
strickland
is
not
a
standard
that
focuses
on
the
views
of
one
juror.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
justice
souter,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
you
have
never
indicated
that
the
strickland
standard
is
to
address
the
hypothetical
views
of
a
single
juror
on
a
jury.
strickland
speaks
to
a
decision
by
a
fact-finder,
and--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
again,
the
strickland
itself
i
think
is
designed--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i'm
not
trying
to
put
this
in
terms
of
a
reasonable
mitigation.
strickland
gives
us
a
test,
i
think,
that
would
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question.
we're
not
looking
at
the
particular
jury
who
sat
on
a
case.
we're
not
looking
at
the
specific
decisionmaker
who
decided
this
case,
and
strickland--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
i
think
that
strickland's
asking
how
it
affects
a
reasonable
jury.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
justice
souter,
if
we're
talking
about
a
reasonable
juror
in
the
sense
of
12
reasonable
jurors,
all
of
whom
are
looking
at
this
case
conscientiously,
impartially,
and
faithfully
applying
the
law,
then
it's
no
difference
looking
at
one
as
it
is
looking
at
12.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
strickland
specifically
says
you're
not
to
look
at
the
predispositions
for
leniency
or
for
harshness.
it's
looking
at--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
think
it
is
in...
strickland
speaks
in
terms
of
the
jury
reaching
a
decision
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
or
sentence.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
a
universal,
the
juror.
you
cannot
allow--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
don't
think
i
understand
that
concept.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
standard
at
all.
if
you
look
at
what
williams
is
asking
for,
he's
asking
for
a
jury...
for
the
court
to
look
at
in
strickland,
a
jury
that
has
at
least
one
juror
that's
on
his
side.
i
mean,
he
is
specifically
saying
that
there
must
be
a
range
of
jurors
with
different
opinions--
