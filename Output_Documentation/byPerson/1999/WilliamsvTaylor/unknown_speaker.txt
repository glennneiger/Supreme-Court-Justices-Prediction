unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
seven
experienced
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
unknown
speaker
well,
(d)(1)
says,
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
if
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
made
a
reasonable
application,
say
of
our
decision
in
strickland
v.
washington,
then
the...
your
client
would
not
prevail?
unknown
speaker
but
how--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
statute
says,
it
has
to
have
involved
an
unreasonable
application.
by
definition
a
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--well
then,
you
say
in
effect
that
(d)(1)
really
did
nothing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gibbons,
do
you
argue
that
in
reading
strickland
as
modified
generally
by
lockhart
that
a
legal
error
was
made?
unknown
speaker
does
that,
then...
let's
assume
that
i
agree
with
you
there,
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument.
in
your
judgment,
does
that
legal
error
itself
entitle
you
to
a
reversal
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
was
contrary
to
the
law
as
established
by
this
court,
without
going
any
further?
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose
it
chooses
the
right
legal
standard,
but
it
misapplies
it.
does
the
contrary-to
clause
become
inapplicable,
and
you're
then
in
the
next
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you,
if
the
correct
legal
standard
is
incorrectly
applied,
you
can
say
that
that
is
contrary
to
law.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say...
you
might
say
it's
contrary
to
law,
but
how
can
you
say
that
it's
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law
where
you
have
a...
one
federal
case,
and
your
assertion
is,
you
haven't
applied
it
properly
to
another
situation,
or
you've
mixed
up
strickland
and
lockhart?
i
can
see
how
you
can
say
it's
contrary
to
federal
law,
but
i
can't
see
how
you
can
say
it's
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
ex
ante,
or
ex
post?
i
mean,
are
you
saying
so
long
as
we
say
it's
wrong
later,
it's
contrary
to
clearly
established
law?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
to
say
clearly
established
in
order
to
achieve
that.
you
could
have
just
said,
a
reasonable
application
of
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
but
congress
is
going
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
it's
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gibbons--
unknown
speaker
--well--
--mr.
gibbons,
i
thought
your
position
was,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
this
was
a
clearly
established
violation.
this
was
contrary.
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
did,
what
the
fourth
circuit
did
was
contrary
to
strickland,
because
strickland
never
required
this
additional
test
of
beyond
prejudice,
and
both
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
added
something
in
addition
to
incompetence
and
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
so
we
get
no--
unknown
speaker
--why
do
you
say
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
supreme
court
of
virginia...
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
cited
strickland,
and
it
seemed
to
me
said
the
correct
rule.
now,
your
quarrel
really
is
with
the
way
they
applied
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question:
isn't
there
a
debate
between
the
parties
as
to
what
the
right
rule
is,
whether
strickland
is
strickland
by
itself,
or
strickland
as
modified
by
lockhart?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
do
that,
then
one
could
argue
they
applied
the
wrong
rule.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
was
it
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
or
the
fourth
circuit
that
relied
on
lockhart?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
can
accept
that
and
still
say
that
if
there
is
reasonable
room
for
disagreement
among
judges.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
telling
us
how
to
decide
it,
counsel,
they
are
telling
us
not
to
decide
it.
there's
a
difference
between
telling
us
how
to
decide
a
case,
which
was
boerne,
and
telling
us
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
a
case,
which
is
what
congress
is
doing
in
its
habeas
corpus
statutes.
now,
it
says
in
that
statute,
not
contrary
to
federal
law,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
what
you're
saying.
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
say
that
it
has
to
be
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law.
i
take
that
to
mean
federal
law
that
is
so
clear
that
there's
no
room
for
disagreement
among
reasonable
judges
as
to
what
the
law
requires,
and
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
i
don't
understand
what
it
means.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
congress
to
use
the
language
of
teague
if
that's
what
it
wanted
to
do.
this
isn't
the
same
language
as
teague.
unknown
speaker
what
deference
do
we
give
to
signing
statements
by
the
president?
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
our
cases
speak
to
that
at
all,
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
the
president
gets
these
things
after
congress
has
done,
so
i
mean,
that's
sort
of
very...
what
if
a
congressional
conference
committee
has
said
one
thing,
and
then
it
comes
to
the
president
and
he
says
just
the
opposite,
i
understand
this
statute
to
mean
x--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
congressional
conference
committee
had
said,
we
understand
it
to
mean
y?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
it's
sort
of
a
dirty
trick
to
come
in
at
the
end
of
the
game
and
say
that
it
means
x
when
you
know
congress
thinks
it's
y,
which
may
have
been
the
case
here.
unknown
speaker
but
we
really
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gibbons,
wasn't
there--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
gibbons,
wasn't
there
a
modification
from
the
original
language
in
aedpa,
that
there
was
a
standard
calling
for
greater
respect
for
the
state
court
decision,
and
that
was
qualified
in
the
final
statement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gibbons,
they
are
not
telling
us
how
to
decide
a
question
of
constitutional
law,
they
are
telling
us
not
to
decide
particular
cases.
congress
tells
us
not
to
decide
particular
cases
all
the
time.
the
constitution
gives
them
the
authority
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
congress
can
limit
the
scope
of
review
on
habeas
corpus
in
a
way
that
perhaps
it
couldn't
on
direct
review.
don't
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
pretty
strong
hint.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
congress...
could
congress--
unknown
speaker
--could
congress
make
a
statute
codifying
our
successive
writ
jurisprudence,
where
you
cannot
bring
successive
writs?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
that
telling
us
how
to
decide
a
case,
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
this
statute
in
a
way,
because
we
could
have
taken
this
from
state
on
review
of
the
state
collateral
proceedings
and
reached
the
same
issue.
unknown
speaker
could
congress
get
away--
--it
certainly
intended
that
the
review
in
a
habeas
review
could
be
much
more
limited
than
section
1257.
don't
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it
within
the
power
of
congress
to
say
that
habeas
relief
will
never
be
granted
for
an
error
of
law
alone,
however
clear
that
error
may
be?
in
other
words,
you
always
have
to
look
in
effect
to
the
bottom
line
of
the
determination,
or
the
verdict,
or
a
judgment
below,
and
only
if
that
bottom
line
involves
in
effect
an
error
may
you
grant
habeas
relief?
is
that
within
the
power
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
an
argument
here
that
when
congress
uses
the
word
decision,
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
clearly
established
law,
what
it
was
trying
to
get
at
was
some
kind
of
a,
in
effect
a
bottom-line
review
as
distinct
from
a
review
in
which
a
federal
court
says,
there
was
a
clear
error
of
law,
habeas
relief
granted.
couldn't
congress
do
that
and,
if
it
could,
do
you
think
that's
what
it
was
doing
when
it
used
the
word
decision
here?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
it
doesn't
mean
opinion,
so
if...
so
long
as
they
reach
the
right
result,
even
if
their
opinion
is
all
messed
up,
and
recites
the
law
quite
incorrectly,
so
long
as
they
stumbled
into
the
right
result
somehow,
that's
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
think
that
is
different
from
what
i,
at
least,
understood
you
to
be
saying
at
the
beginning,
and
i
thought
you
were
saying
at
the
beginning
that
if
they
made
a
clear
error
of
law
about
strickland,
i.e.,
in
saying
that
strickland
was
generally
modified
by
lockhart,
that
that
would
be
a
basis
for
habeas
relief.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gibbons,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
first
established
without
regard
to
aedpa
that
this
was
a
clear
violation
of
strickland--
unknown
speaker
--because
the
ruling
on
prejudice
was
simply
wrong,
and
only
after
you
established
that
did
you
go
on,
because
i
assume
that
your
position
was,
if
there
hadn't
been
a
showing
of
prejudice,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
and
the
rest
would
be
academic.
do
i
understand
you
right?
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
you
first
said,
here
was
a
clearly
established
violation
of
the
strickland
standard.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
gibbons.
mr.
harris,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
general
question
about
that
history?
does
that
history
indicate
that
the
legislature
debated
which
view
was
correct
as
between
justice
o'connor's
view
and
justice
thomas'
view
in
wright
v.
west?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
really
focus
on
that.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority
for
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
the
problem
i
have
is
that
this
is
not
usually
how
courts
work,
that
this
is
a
very
different
approach
for
the
congress
to
impose
on
this
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
the
ornalis
case,
where
we
talked
about
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact
in
the
probable
cause
for
search
area,
we
said
that
independent
review
is
necessary
if
we
are
to
maintain
control
and
to
clarify
federal
principles.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
competency
cases
usually
occur
on
collateral
review,
state
and
federal,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
in
effect,
what
congress
has
done,
is
tell
us,
say
it
once,
and
then
don't
say
it
again,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
law
develops.
unknown
speaker
congress
has
said,
once
we
announce
the
principle,
we
cannot
refine
it,
apply
it,
explain
it,
expand
it,
contract
it--
unknown
speaker
--if
i
understand
your
argument,
mr.
harris,
there
could
never
be
any
determination
that
a
state
court
misapplied
strickland,
because
on
your
view
and
the
fourth
circuit's
view
of
what
is
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law,
it
must
be
a
case
that's
on
all
fours.
the
bottom
line
in
strickland
was
that
the
defendant
lost.
unknown
speaker
the
court
announced
a
standard,
so
you
could
never
have
a
case
on
all
fours
with
strickland
that
the
petitioner
could
win,
in
your
view
of
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
tell
me
if,
in
your
view,
a
defendant,
a
petitioner
for
habeas
corpus,
federal
habeas
corpus,
could
ever
prevail
on
a
strickland
claim
given
that
strickland
himself
did
not
prevail?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean,
then,
that
the
court
would
have
had
to
say,
strickland
doesn't
govern,
but
we're
not
looking
at
strickland,
or
what...
i
don't
quite
have
a
grasp
on
what
you
mean
by--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
your
opponent
says
that,
if
i
understood
the
argument
correctly,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
court
says
about
strickland,
that
this
statute
only
applies
to
decisions
contrary
to
strickland,
so
even
if
you
misdescribe
what
strickland
says,
we
don't
really
have
to
look
to
the
opinion
at
all.
unknown
speaker
we
just
look
to
the
result.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that
reading?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
matter
of
going
that
far.
i
want
to
know
what
the...
what
decision
means.
i
have
to
come
to
some--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
it
said
something
clearly
contrary
to
strickland,
but
the
result...
it
might
have
been
contrary
to
strickland,
might
not
have
been
contrary.
the
result's
pretty
close.
it's...
you
know,
strickland
might
have
produced
that
result,
but
it's
clear
that
the
court
was
not
applying
strickland.
it
was
using
some
other
rule
entirely
that
was
totally
wrong.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
if
the
state
court
did
not
use
strickland,
or
misdescribed
strickland,
that
their
decision
would
be
covered
by
this
provision,
we
could
reverse
them
on
habeas,
even
though
the
result,
if
you
applied
strickland
correctly,
might
have
been
missed
or
might
not
have.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
the
court
does
think
it
has
to
go
that
far.
what
is
the
answer?
do
we...
on
justice
scalia's
hypo
do
we...
t--
unknown
speaker
--grant
relief
or
not?
pardon?
the--
unknown
speaker
--so
on
his
hypothetical,
on
which
the
law
is
clearly
wrong,
the
decision
may
or
may
not
be
right,
we're
not
sure,
no
relief?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
in
answer
to
the
legal
question.
is
that
your
answer,
no
relief
as
a
matter
of
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
take
that
position,
you
leave
the
court,
this
court
and
perhaps
other
federal
courts,
to
have
to
analyze
intensively
the
facts
of
each
case.
supposing
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
here
had
not
even
mentioned
strickland,
but
used
its
own
standard,
which
was
much
less
demand...
much
more
favorable
to
the
state
than
ours,
then
is
your
position
that
we
could
not
reverse
that,
but
we
would
have
to
go
through
the
facts
and
say,
well
now,
if
we
were
to
apply
strickland
to
these
facts,
what
would
we
come
up
with?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
this
is
kind
of
an
unlikely
hypothetical.
in
all
these
cases,
the
state
court's
going
to
know
strickland
is
on
the
books
and
they're
going
to
cite
strickland,
they're
going
to
at
least
repeat
the
basic
rule
it
sets
forth.
what
troubles
me
is,
it
seems
to
me
your
view,
and
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
that
if
the
state
supreme
court
correctly
cites
the
rule
and
says,
we've
looked
at
the
record
and
we
think
there's
no
prejudice
here,
that
the
man
was...
and
we're
reasonable
judges,
unless
you
could
say
that
no
reasonable
judge
could
reach
that
conclusion,
there's
no
relief.
i
think
that's
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
so
is
there
ever
a
chance...
this
kind
of
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
case.
as
long
as
a
unanimous
state
supreme
court
says
there
was
no
prejudice,
there
really
is
no
opportunity
for
relief
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that's
the
fourth
circuit's
treatment
of
it,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
harris,
the
fourth
circuit
said
it
means
reasonable
jurists
would
all
agree
that
the
interpretation
was
unreasonable,
so
to
apply
that
to
this
case
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
jurists
on
the
virginia
supreme
court
were
not
reasonable.
that
was
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation.
all
reasonable
jurists
would
have
to
come
to
this
same
bottom
line.
unknown
speaker
but
reasonable
jurists
always
disagree.
i
mean,
is
there
any
instance
where
you
could
get
a
state
supreme
court
to
say,
we
think
there
was
no
prejudice,
and
meet
this
standard,
without
saying
well,
those
judges
on
the
virginia
supreme
court
were
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
i
began
to
think,
after
reading
11
briefs
on
this,
that
if
we
take
this
statute,
which
is
clearly
a
compromise,
and
interpret
it
literally,
we're
going
to
have
a
system
that's
so
complicated
that
virtually
no
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
able
to
administer
it,
and
few
appellate
judges,
so
i
wondered
what
you'd
think
of
reading
this
statute
as
legislating
a
mood,
rather
like
universal
camera
and
the
apa.
they're
saying
in
this
statute
that
the
work
is
done
by
the
words,
contrary
to.
that
keeps
us
our
independence,
except
in
rather
unusual
fact-mixed
questions,
and
the
rest
of
it
is,
they're
saying
to
the
judge,
judge,
pay
attention
to
the
state
courts.
remember,
they're
judges,
too.
it's
a
mood.
and
we've
written
opinions
like
that,
namely,
universal
camera.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
unreasonable
application
clause
were
not
in
the
statute.
all
we
have
is
contrary-to.
then
you
have
a
case
where
they
get
the
correct
standard.
it's
a
close
case.
they
come
out
one
way,
we
think
they
should
have
come
out
the
other
way.
what
result?
unknown
speaker
the
legal
rule
is
right,
they
just
got
it
wrong.
that's
not
teague.
isn't
that
contrary
to
law?
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute
just
had
the
phrase,
contrary
to
law--
unknown
speaker
--let's
say
they
get
the
legal
rule
right,
a
close
case,
we
think
they're
wrong.
it's
justice
breyer's
point
that
i'm
trying
to
pursue.
unknown
speaker
and
if
just
contrary-to
is
the
operative
phrase,
and
involved
and
unreasonable
application
is
not
in
the
statute
at
all,
what
result?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
depends
on
how
literally
you
take
the
word
decision,
and
i
thought
you
were...
you
said
earlier
you
were
going
to
take
decision
quite
literally,
because
the
decision
would
be
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law,
if
you
apply
the
clearly
established
law
incorrectly
to
the
facts,
so
maybe
you
don't
think
decision
really
means
decision.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
it
seems
to
me
saying
contrary-to
would
have
been
enough,
because
every
decision
involves
applying
the
law
to
the
facts.
you
apply
law
to
the
facts,
and
you
get
a
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
quite
correct,
because
teague
prior
to
the
statute
was
just
a
judge-made
rule,
and
conceivably
congress
might
have
wanted
to
include
that
in
statutory
law.
unknown
speaker
so
the
statute
is
not
a
nullity
even
if
you
read
it
as
just
codifying
teague.
unknown
speaker
mr.
harris,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
on
that
point.
the
very
judge
who
sat
on
the
trial,
when
presented
with
this
mitigating
evidence
that
was
not
presented
at
the
trial,
said,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
one
and
perhaps
all
of
the
jurors
would
have
been
affected
by
this.
now,
trial
judges
generally
have
a
better
feeling
for
jurors
and
their
reaction.
does
that
factor
into
this
at
all,
or
must
we
just
shut
from
our
sight
that
the
very
judge
who
conducted
this
trial
thought
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
would
have
been
different?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
see
that
in
his
opinion.
perhaps
you
could
point
it
out
to
me.
i
thought
he
said
that
this
evidence,
this
very
evidence
would
have
persuaded
at
least
one
and
perhaps
all
of
the
jurors
to
come
to
a
different
result.
unknown
speaker
page
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that
was
in
a
context
when
this
defense
counsel
came
up
with
no
specific
arguments
on
his
behalf.
didn't...
nothing
about
the
family
background,
the
child
abuse,
and
then
dr.
santora's
conclusion
that
he
would
be
okay
in
a
structured
environment.
that
would
have
been...
that
would
have
completely
changed
his
summation,
because
he
would
have
had
something
specific
to
give
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
mr.
harris,
i
thought
we
were
to
assume
that
there
was...
it
was
incompetent
not
to
present
this
testimony,
and
the
only
question
was
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
a
reference
to
the
testimony
that
could
have
been
brought
in
about
the
horrendous
conditions
in
which
williams
was
brought
up,
and
none
of
that
was
presented,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
is
it
assumed--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
was
such
mitigating
evidence?
unknown
speaker
okay.
isn't
the
question,
then,
on...
or
isn't
it
a
question,
then,
on
prejudice
whether,
given
the
open-endedness
of
the
present
federal
law
on
the
admissibility
of
mitigating
evidence,
whether
one
reasonable
juror
could
have
heard
the
testimony
about
this
guy's
childhood
and
said,
here
but
for
the
grace
of
god
go
i,
i'm
not
going
to
vote
to
execute
somebody
who
has
come
out
of
these
circumstances.
that
reasonable
probability,
in
fact
possibility,
is
all
you
have
to
show
under
strickland,
and
isn't
that
enough?
does
that
not
demonstrate
prejudice
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that's
what
they
concluded,
but
i'm
giving
you
a
specific
example
of
what
would
in
fact
be
admissible
mitigating
evidence
under
the
law
as
it
is
now,
and
i'm
saying,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
one
juror
could
have
heard
that
evidence
and
said,
i'm
not
going
to
execute
for
that
purpose,
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
isn't
that
a
sufficient
showing
of
strickland
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
that...
i
guess
that
gets
us
to
the
issue
implicit
in
my
question.
strickland
prejudice
is
a
standard
that,
in
fact,
looks
to
the
possibility
of
a
different
result.
what
is
or
is
not
possible
as
a
different
result,
i
take
it,
is
a
function
of
way...
in
part,
of
the
way
the
state
structures
its
process
of
making
decisions,
and
if
in
the
state
structure
one
juror's
decision
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty
is
sufficient
to
bar
the
death
penalty,
then
why
do
we
not
look,
for
strickland
purposes,
to
the
possibility,
the
reasonable
possibility,
or
the
reasonable
probability
of
what
one
juror
out
of
12
would
do
and
let
it
go
at
that?
why
isn't
that
the
way
we
go
about
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
harris,
if
we
went
that
far,
why
shouldn't
we
go
even
a
little
further
and
acknowledge
the
reasonable
probability
that
one
of
the
12
jurors
is
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
you
could
sow
that
you
had
one
of
the
12,
and
maybe
bring
in
evidence
to
show
that
one
of
the
12
was
a
bleeding
heart
and
had
an
abused
childhood
himself
or
herself
and
would
have
given
enormous
undue
weight
to
this...
which
you're
allowed
to.
i
mean,
that's
what
all
the
mitigating
evidence
is,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
to
talk
about
reasonable
mitigation,
i...
you
know,
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
unknown
speaker
it's
sort
of
throwing
yourself
on
the
mercy
of
the
jury,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to
talk
about
reasonable
mercy?
unknown
speaker
we
are
making
the
assumption
that
the
jurors
are
reasonable,
and
we
are
asking
how
a
particular
kind
of
mitigating
evidence,
admissible
mitigating
evidence
could
affect
a
reasonable
juror.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
say,
well,
we're
going
to
translate
that
into
a
scheme
that
demands
unanimity
of
reasonableness,
as
justice
ginsburg
said
a
moment
ago
with
respect
to
judges,
reasonable
judges
are
disagreeing
all
the
time,
and
if
you
translate
this
into
a
hypothetical
unanimity
of
12
people
in
responding
to
a
particular
piece
of
evidence,
as
opposed
simply
looking
to
the
question
of
what
a
reasonable
juror
might
reasonably
have
done,
it
seems
to
me
you're
reading
the
practicality
of
the
standard
right
out
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
reasonably
merciful
jurors
is
what
you're
saying,
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
strickland
understands
what
i
think
our
mitigation
jurisprudence
understands,
that
the
significance
of
this
kind
of
evidence
is
for
the
jury
to
decide,
once
it
is
determined
to
be
admissible,
so
that
the
only
question,
once
it
is
admitted,
is
whether
a
reasonable
juror
could
find,
or
could
find
not
to
a
degree
of
probability
but
to
a
high
degree
of
possibility,
that
this
was
evidence
that
ought
to
be
treated
in
mitigation
and
hence
bar
the
death
penalty.
that's
the
only
question,
isn't
it?
is
the
question
what
the
reasonable
juror
would
find,
or
what
a
reasonable
juror
would
find?
is
there
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
if
that's--
--is
there
a
reasonable
disposition
in
these
mitigation
cases?
i
mean,
can
you
say
that,
you
know,
giving
the
death
penalty
is
reasonable
and
giving...
i
mean,
in
every
case
there
is
a
reasonable
decision
and
an
unreasonable
decision
in
these
mitigation
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
concept
of
reasonableness
means
nothing
to
me
when
you're
talking
about
throwing
yourself
on
the
mercy
of
the
jury
and
saying,
look,
i
had
a
terrible
childhood.
you
know,
it's
been
a
long
haul.
is
this
a
question
of
reason,
or
is
it
a
question
of
disposition
towards
mercy,
which
different
people
may
have
in
different
degrees.
i
don't
know
how
to
analyze
that
under
a
standard
of
reasonableness.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
see
that--
--thank
you,
counselor.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
mr.
gibbons,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
whereabouts
on
the--
unknown
speaker
--whereabouts
on
the
page
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
gibbons?
unknown
speaker
444?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
penultimate
paragraph
starting,
in
conclusion,
the
court
simply
is
quoting
from
language
in
strickland.
unknown
speaker
well,
turning
back
to
443,
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
that
you're
referring
to,
the
first
sentence
is...
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
virginia...
unfortunately,
the
circuit
court
appears
to
have
adopted
a
per
se
approach
to
the
prejudice
element.
now,
that
is
not...
that
in
itself
is
not
a
misapplication
of
strickland,
is
it,
to
say
the
circuit
court
was
wrong
for
adopting
a
per
se
approach?
unknown
speaker
i
read
that
differently,
judge
gibbons.
i
thought
the
per
se
approach
that
the
chief
justice
referred
to
was
what
he...
the
court
referred
to
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
run-over
paragraph,
mere
outcome
determination.
in
other
words,
i
thought
they
were
saying
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
result
would
have
been
different
is
not
enough
under
strickland.
you
must
also
have
some
sort
of
an
unfairness
in
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
certainly
you
need
an
error
in
the
trial.
the
mere
fact
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different,
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
counsel
fails
to
play
the
race
card
in
the
trial,
and
that
had
he
done
so,
his
client
might
have
gotten
off.
would
that
be
enough
to...
of
course
not.
it
wouldn't
be
enough.
unknown
speaker
the
outcome
would
be
different.
it
would
not
have
been
an
unfair
trial
in
which
he
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--outcome
different
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
adequate
performance
by
counsel.
