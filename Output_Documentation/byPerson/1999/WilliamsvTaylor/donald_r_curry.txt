mr.
donald
r.
curry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
out
to
try
to
clear
up
a
matter
of
virginia
law
on
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
blume
has
reiterated
that
williams
is
conceding
he
cannot
make
out
this
innocence
requirement
under
2254(e)(2)(b).
in
his
reply
brief,
though,
he
does
make
some
contentions
about
virginia
law
and
capital
murder
law
that
are
flat
wrong,
and
i
suppose
he
does
this
in
the
context
of
trying
to
show
materiality
for
his
brady
claims.
but
it
is
important
that
the
court
be
clear
about
this.
there
is
no
doubt
under
virginia
law
that
someone
who
does
what
williams
got
on
the
stand
and
admitted
at
trial
that
he
did
is
guilty
of
capital
murder
under
virginia
law.
he
admitted
that
he
acted
in
concert
with
his
codefendant.
he
admitted
that
he
intended
to
kill
mr.
keller.
he
admitted
that
he
intended
for
his
codefendant
to
kill
mrs.
keller.
he
admitted
that
he
was
a
full
participant
in
the
armed
robbery
of
the
kellers.
he
admitted
that
he
was
an
accomplice
to
the
rape
of
mrs.
keller
and,
most
important,
he
admitted
that
he
shot
mr.
keller
in
the
head
with
the
intent
to
kill.
now,
in
the
reply
brief
he
comes
back
and
tries
to
say,
well,
we
don't
really
know
where
he
shot
him.
he
could
have
shot
him
in
the
leg.
i
would
just
refer
the
court
back
to
his
opening
brief--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--not
if
it
is
raised
in
a
state
collateral
proceeding
as
evidence
in
support
of
a
claim.
for
instance,
the
juror
claims.
he
certainly
could
have
raised
the
juror
claims.
it's
done
all
the
time.
he
can
raise
brady
claims.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
21
days
has...
the
21-day
rule
in
virginia
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
but
the
21-day
rule
in
virginia
is
that
you
have
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence
within
21
days.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
yes,
justice
o'connor,
if
it's
in
connection
with
a
claim.
you
can't
be
just
plain
evidence
of
innocence,
on
a
strict
matter
of
guilt
or
innocence,
unrelated
to
a
claim,
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--right.
you
cannot
do
it
in
that
abstract
context.
he
can
do
it
in
the
context
of
a
claim
that
this
juror
was
biased,
that
i
have
a
brady
claim
because
evidence--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--yes.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
yes,
just
like
any
other
of
his
habeas
claims.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
he--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--he--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--oh,
certainly.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
file
his...
in
a
capital
case,
he
doesn't
have
to
file
his
habeas
petition
until
60
days
after
this
court
denies
cert.
it's
done
all
the
time.
now,
on
the
point
that
you--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
and
they're
the
ones
who
decide
whether
it
goes
back
for
a
hearing.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
a
60-day--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--yes.
there's...
it
would
be...
his
claims
that
he
did
not
raise
in
state
court
would
be
cut
off
for
two
reasons
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
60
days
after
denial
of
cert
he
has
to
file
his
state
habeas
petition.
he
can
raise
any
constitutional
claim
he
wants.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
absolutely.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
absolutely.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
because
that's
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
intended
to
cut
through
all
that
in
most
cases
by
requiring
a
strong
showing
of
innocence--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
i
would
certainly
have
to
defer
to
the
court
as
to
the
reasons
it
granted
cert,
but
this
case
is--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--justice
breyer,
the
one
thing
we
know
about
this
statute
is
that
congress
linked
the
due
diligence
requirement
and
the
innocence
requirement.
it's
connected
with
the
word,
and.
that
is
indisputable.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
see
the
petitioner
has
taken
that
issue
away
from
the
court.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
he
concedes
he
can't
meet
it,
and
the
statute
clearly
requires
both.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
you
have
to
get
to
both.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
he
says
it
doesn't,
we
say
it
does.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
that's...
his
whole
case
is,
he's
got
to
get
out
from
under
the
statute
entirely
because
of
what
he
admitted
in
the
first
15
seconds
today.
he
cannot
show
the
innocence
requirement,
and
so
his
tactic
throughout
this
has
been
to
try
to
break
that
link
that
congress
made,
and
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
disputed
that
congress
made
that
link,
due
diligence
and
innocence.
now--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
his
term,
and
i
don't
know
what
he
means
by
strict
liability.
it
does
mean
this.
you
can't
have
a
hearing
unless
you
show
both
requirements.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
absolutely.
that
goes
to
attribution
of
fault--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--for
the
failure.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
i
certainly
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
because
of
what
they
said
in--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--all
of
the
concerns
that
you're
talking
about,
justice
souter,
are
the
concerns
which
this
court,
when
it
was
up
to
this
court
in
making
the
policy
judgments,
channeled
into
the
cause
requirement.
not
any
kind
of
threshold
test
as
to
whether
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
applied,
but
into
the
cause
requirement.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no.
i'm
saying
you
might
be
able
to
satisfy
the
(a)(2)
requirement
could
not
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
that
is
congress'
equivalent--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--justice
souter,
i
hope
i
have
the
time
to
get
to
that,
because
we
certainly
dispute
that
these
claims
could
have
been
raised...
could
not
have
been
raised
with
due
diligence
in
state
court.
but
let
me
tell
you
why
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
the
meaning
of
fault
that
mr.
blume
is
suggesting.
there's
certainly
nothing
about
using
the
word
applicant
to
start
off
the
statute,
which
is
unusual,
because
every
statute,
every
subsection
of
2254(b)
either
says
application
or
applicant.
but
the
failure,
there
is
no
reason,
if
you
look
at
2254
as
a
whole,
or
other
sections,
or
any
other
habeas
statute
in
aedpa,
why
you
would
give
it
a
connotation
of
fault.
for
instance,
2254(b)--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
i
do
think
that
that
was
congress'
intent,
that
they
did
not
intend
to
unleash
the
power
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
the
form
of
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
case
of
a
state
prisoner
absent
a
strong
showing
of
innocence.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
because
they
also
want
the
prisoner
to
be
diligent.
they
require
both--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--sure,
absolutely,
and
you
know,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--oh,
there's
no
question
they
have,
and
i
think
they're
dead
wrong.
basically
what
they
said
is--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--absolutely,
and
i'll
go
to
the
individual
claims
if
the
court
likes
at
this
point.
on
the
juror
claims,
let
me...
first
of
all,
the
deputy
sheriff
was
not
the
chief
investigating
officer,
and
everybody
should
know
that
from
reading
the
record.
he
was
a
minor
witness.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence.
the
defense
didn't
even
cross-examine
him.
but
williams
had
a
state-appointed
habeas
attorney.
he
had
the
resource
center
working
with
him
in
the
state
habeas
petition,
and
that
is
shown
in
state
habeas
counsel's
letter
to
me
at
page
344
of
the
appendix.
the
resource
center
has
their
own
investigator.
now,
they
say
they
can't
be
faulted
for
not
going
out
and
interviewing
the
jurors.
they
can't
say
they
had
no
reason
to,
at
least
subjectively,
because
they
say
they
made
a
motion.
they
did
make
a
motion.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
they
could
have
interviewed
the
prosecutor,
too,
but
the
claim
wouldn't--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no,
i'm
not.
the...
first
of
all,
the
prosecutor's
affidavit
is
in
the
record.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
because
they...
justice
stevens,
they
told
the
virginia
supreme
court
that
they
wanted
an
investigator
to
go
interview
the
jurors.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
but
justice
stevens--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--justice
stevens,
the
claim
doesn't
arise
without
talking
to
the
jurors.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
she
was
asked,
have
you
been
represented
by
any
parties,
and
she
didn't
respond
to
the
question
because
she
didn't
think...
look,
this
was
an
uncontested
divorce,
and
hopefully
some
other--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--absolutely.
during
the
state
collateral
proceeding
they
could
have
gone
and
interviewed
the
jurors
just
like
they
did
for
the
federal
habeas--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--defense
counsel,
or
state
habeas
counsel?
mr.
donald
r.
curry
absolutely.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
absolutely
not.
they
told
the
virginia
supreme
court
that
they
were...
they
alleged
it
in
conclusory
fashion--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no,
justice
souter--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no,
they
weren't.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
they
alleged
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
that
there
were
irregularities
with
respect
to
the
jury,
and
that's
why
they
wanted
to
go
interview
them.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
state
habeas
counsel
could
not
have
done
that.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
number,
but
it
is
small.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
the
other
what?
mr.
donald
r.
curry
let
me
tell
you
two
reasons
why
it
doesn't
matter.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
it
wasn't
there
and
that
he
just
missed
it.
this
is
really
a
claim
of
ineffective
habeas
counsel.
let
me
tell
you
why.
because
the
trial
record
of...
or
the
state
habeas
exhibit
that
they
submitted
was
a
transcript
of
the
codefendant's
sentencing
proceeding
in
which
a
psychiatric
report
was
specifically
mentioned.
now,
it's
either
one
or
the
other.
it
was
either
in
cruse's
file
when
he
went,
and
he
missed
it,
or
didn't
know
the
significance
of
it,
or
just
doesn't
recollect
seeing
it,
or
it
wasn't
there,
for
whatever
reason
they
want
to
dream
up,
and
he's
on
inquiry
notice.
he
goes
to
the
court
and
he
says,
well,
wait
a
minute
now,
i
produced
a
transcript
of
cruse's
sentencing
that
shows
that
a
psychiatric
report
was
gathered
as
a
bit
of
his
presentence
report.
i've
looked
at
the
file.
it's
not
there.
i
want
it.
he
can't
have
it
both
ways.
he's
not
diligent
either
way.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
he
made
it
an
exhibit
with
his
state
habeas
petition.
he
submitted
it
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
as
his
exhibit.
it
specifically
says
in
there
there
was
a
psychiatric
report.
now,
that
brings
up
another
point
as
to
why
this
really
isn't
even
brady
material,
because
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
this
psychiatric
report
was
done
as
part
of
his
pretrial
and
cross...
it
was
not
part
of
the
prosecution.
it
wasn't
even
gathered
until
a
presentence
investigation
was
done
on
cruse
after
williams'
trial.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
i--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--when
he
asked
about
a
psychiatric--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no,
that's
not
right.
he...
they
sent
me
a
letter
making
just
an
informal
request
for
discovery,
but
it
was...
you
know,
it
was
everything
but
the
kitchen
sink.
it
was
your
typical
omnibus
discovery
request
that
you'd
file
in
the
trial
court.
now,
they
have
tried
to
characterize
that
as
somehow
that
i
gave
a
response
similar
to
the
response
that
was
given
in
the
strickler
case,
where
this
court
found
as
part
of
the
reason
or
cause
that
he
could
have
relied
on
that,
that
there
was
some
sort
of
assurance
that
everything
he
had
been
given
he
had
been
given
at
trial.
i
said
absolutely
nothing
like
that.
i
said,
we're
not
going
to
agree
to
informal
discovery.
you
have
to
file
a
motion
with
the
virginia
supreme
court,
which
they
didn't
do,
so
i
misled
them
not
at
all,
and
they
have
never
characterized
what
i
said
to
them
as
any
kind
of
misleading
or
assurance
until
after
strickler
was
decided.
before
that,
it
was
just,
you
know,
mr.
curry
gave
us
the
brush-off,
which
is
basically,
i
guess
you
could
characterize...
i
didn't
agree
to
anything,
and
i
certainly
made
no
representations
that
they
had
been
given
everything
they
were
entitled
to
at
trial.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
i--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--i--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
it's
permissible
to
say
that
congress
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
i
mean,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
a
perfectly
familiar
standard,
and
this,
unlike--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
congress
could
say
there
is
no
statutory
habeas
relief
except
in
the
absence
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
innocence.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
he
ruled
against
me
on
what
point?
mr.
donald
r.
curry
about
this
alleged
secret
deal?
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
this
to
me
is
the
weakest
of
all
claims.
first
of
all,
it's
a
2254(d)
claim.
this
is
a
claim
that
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court,
so
you
never
get
to
2254(e)(2),
unless
it
gets
passed
2254(d),
and
the
state
court
clearly
was
reasonable
in
rejecting
this
claim,
because
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
it.
there
was
no
evidence
in
state
court.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
there
was
no
evidence
in
federal
court.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
it's
two
different
claims.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
don't
see
the
inference,
the
connection
between
those
two
things.
i
mean,
look--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--right.
he
made
a
statement
that
because
of
the
drugs
and...
marijuana
and
alcohol--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--justice
stevens,
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--i
don't
think
defense
counsel
would
have
even
used
that
if
they'd
known
about
it.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
don't
think
it
has
any
connection
to
whether
or
not
he
has
a
deal.
he
testified
that
he
had
a
written
deal--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--oh,
certainly.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
absolutely
not.
i
don't
see
any
connection
at
all.
williams'
whole
defense
was
based
on
his
testimony.
to
the
extent
that
they
drank
and
smoked
marijuana,
his
credibility
would
have
been
equally
suspect.
the
defense
wouldn't
have
even
used
this,
and
this
report
would
have
reinforced
some
basic
points
that
the
prosecutor
was
trying
to
make,
and
that
is
that
cruse
was
the
remorseful
one,
that
williams,
who
got
on
the
stand
and
in
the
words
of
his
own
trial
attorneys
was
cold
as
a
stone...
of
course,
williams
also
told
an
obvious
lie
when
he
said
he
didn't
rape
mrs.
keller,
because
the
forensic
evidence
proved
that
he
did.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
was
not
fatal?
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
this
shot
did
cause
the
death,
but
no--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--no.
i
think
if
he
fires...
if
he
fires
a
shot
and
hits
the
person,
and
the
other
person,
the
codefendant
shoots
too,
they're
both
guilty
of
capital
murder.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
the
jury
would
have
to
find
that
they
were
what
we
call
joint
participants,
that
they
each
played
a
part,
an
active
part
in
inflicting
the
fatal
injuries.
i
don't
think
that
that
requires
that
they
pinpoint
to
the
bullet
that
he
fired
through
mr.
keller's
face,
that
that...
if
that
had
been
the
only
shot,
it
would
have
killed
him.
the
medical
examiner
said,
all
three
head
shots
contributed
to
his
death.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
that's
right.
i
agree.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
r.
curry
you
can
look
at--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--you
can
look
at
judge
merhige's
statement
at
page
645,
that
they
all
three
definitely
contributed
to
mr.
keller's
death,
all
three
of
the
head
shots.
