first

terry
williams
v.
john
taylor.
mr.
gibbons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
gibbons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-6615,
michael
wayne
williams
v.
john
taylor.
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
blume,
you
agree
that
your
client
could
not
meet
the
very
last
of
those
specifications
in
the
event
that
the
court
found
that
that
was
necessary
for
you
to
prevail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
else
would
develop
the
facts,
other
than
the
applicant,
in
a
state
collateral
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
typically
if
you're
the
petitioner
in
a
state
collateral
review,
you're
seeking
to
develop
the
facts,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
the
word
fail...
i
concede
that
that's
certainly
a
plausible
argument,
but
you
know,
you
say
that
someone
in
a
golf
tournament
failed
to
make
the
cut.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
didn't
play
as
well
as
they
should
have.
maybe
they
did
the
best
they
could
and
they
still
failed
to
make
the
cut.
it's
just
a
factual
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
on
the
question
of
just,
with
respect
to
her
ex-husband,
you
know,
if
she
had
been
asked,
do
you
know
any
of
these
people,
obviously
had
she
said
no
with
respect
to
him
it
would
have
been
a
misstatement,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
asked
was
a
fairly
limited
one.
maybe
you
wished
later
you'd
say
did
she
know,
but
she
was
no
longer
related
to
the
person.
she
was
not
presently
related
to
him.
i
just
don't
see
you
have
much
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
you
know,
you
can
say
the
witness
should
have
been
more
forthcoming,
but
you're
alleging
a
constitutional
violation
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
very
blurry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
on
your
allegations,
though,
it's
a
very
weak
claim,
it
seems
to
me,
even
assuming
you
can
prove
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
question
wasn't,
what
was
your
relationship
with,
it's
are
you
related
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
simply
wrong
in
saying
that
the
answer
wasn't
true
about
related
to.
she
was
not
related
to.
it's
you
who
have
to
kind
of
fuzz
over
the
thing
to
even
get
a
plausible
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
ago
had
that
been
at
the
time
of
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
an
uncontested
divorce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
her...
wasn't
her
answer
she
simply
didn't
recall
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
blume.
mr.
curry,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
get
to
the
due
diligence
part
of
the
section,
then
surely
you
can
get
to
the
same
part
that's
joined
by
and.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
take
it
we're
talking
here
not
about
whether
they
get
ultimate
habeas
relief,
but
whether
they
get
discovery
or
not.
i
mean,
i
take
it
a
prisoner
who
could
not
make
this
claim
of
innocence
could
nonetheless
claim
that
wrong
constitutional
rulings
were
made
throughout
his
trial,
have
a
perfect
right
to
raise
those.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--counsel,
i
looked
at...
this
case
arose
in
what,
cumberland
county,
virginia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
saw
from
the
atlas
cumberland
county
has
a
population
of
7,500.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
right
order
of...
and
are
jurors
for
a
trial
like
this
drawn
from
anywhere
outside
of
cumberland
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
curry.
mr.
blume,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
legal
point
of
virginia
law
covered
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
blume.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
second

taylor
