justice
stephen
g.
breyer
william
fiore
owned
a
hazardous
waste
facility
in
pennsylvania;
david
scarpone
was
the
manager.
now,
they
were
tried
jointly
for
violating
a
state
law
that
forbids
operating
such
a
facility,
as
it
is
waste
facility
without
a
permit,
and
they
were
convicted
despite
the
fact
that
they
did
have
a
permit.
but
the
trial
court
said
that
fiore
and
scarpone
had
deviated
so
far
from
the
permit
that
as
far
as
the
statute’s
concerned
it’s
just
as
if
they
didn’t
have
one.
they
both
appealed
that
conviction,
but
for
reasons
of
state
law,
their
appeals
went
to
different
courts.
now
the
appellate
courts
in
pennsylvania
upheld
mr.
fiore’s
conviction
and
it
became
final,
but
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
having
granted
review
on
his
co-defendant
scarpone’s
case,
later
held
that,
that
statute
meant
what
it
said;
it
said,
you
have
to
have
a
permit,
and
it
did
not
apply,
or
you
had
one
but
you
deviated
a
lot.
it
applied
only
when
there
was
no
permit
at
all.
so,
scarpone’s
conviction
was
reversed.
well,
not
surprisingly,
mr.
fiore
who
was
scarpone’s
co-defendant
tried
to
get
a
similar
result
namely
get
his
own
conviction
reversed,
but
he
failed
to
do
that
in
the
state
court,
so
he
went
to
the
federal
habeas
court
and
argued
that
his
conviction
violated
the
federal
constitution
because
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
that
his
conduct
satisfied
a
key
element
of
the
crime,
namely,
the
total
lack
of
a
permit.
the
commonwealth
responded
that
at
the
time
his
conviction
became
final
i.e.
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decided
scarpone,
the
statute
did
not
require
total
lack
of
a
permit.
the
deviation
was
enough.
but
fiore
rejoined
that
the
scarpone
decision,
even
though
it
came
later,
the
total
lack
decision
was
not
a
new
interpretation
applicable
only
in
the
future,
but
it
was
always
the
correct
law
of
pennsylvania.
that’s
so,
he
said,
either
because
pennsylvania
law
treats
a
statutory
interpretation
in
this
way
i.e.
as
having
always
been
the
law,
or
(2)
because
the
federal
constitution
requires
pennsylvania
to
apply
the
scarpone
decision
to
him.
the
court
of
appeals
however
decided
for
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
we
agree
to
renew
its
decision.
now,
unfortunately,
before
proceeding
with
this
case,
we
think
it
is
important
to
know
whether
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
does
consider
its
scarpone
interpretation
to
have
always
been
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania
statute;
we
therefore
will
ask
them.
we
certify
the
following
question
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
pursuant
to
the
rules
regarding
certification
of
questions
of
pennsylvania
law;
does
the
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
as
set
forth
in
scarpone
versus
commonwealth
state
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
law
of
pennsylvania
as
of
the
time
that
fiore’s
conviction
became
final.
we
are
unanimous
in
that
certification.
