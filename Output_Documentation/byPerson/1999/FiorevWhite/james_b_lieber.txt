mr.
james
b.
lieber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
24
years
i
have
practiced
in
the
pennsylvania
courts.
in
case
after
case,
our
judges
follow
the
law
and
apply
the
constitution.
when
there
is
a
mistake
or
a
miscarriage,
there
is
a
necessary
corrective,
as
there
was
in
the
case
of
mr.
scarpone,
my
client's
co-defendant.
like
his
co-defendant,
mr.
fiore
was
and
is
factually
and
legally
innocent
of
a
crime
which
has
only
two
elements
and
is
plainly
understood
from
the
reading
of
the
statute.
those
elements
are
operating
a
waste
disposal
facility
and
doing
it
without
first
having
a
license.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
respectfully,
i'd
have
to
disagree,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
did
was
deny
a
writ
for
allowance
of
appeal
on
the
same
basis
that
this
court
denies
a
writ
for
certiorari.
no--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--presumably
that's
correct.
however,
no
inference
can
be
drawn
from
their
failure
to
take
jurisdiction
under
king's
bench
powers,
which
is
an
emergency
writ,
or
from
not
hearing
the
case
in
a
certiorari-like
situation
that
mirrors
your
very
rules.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
my
client's
conviction
is,
in
fact,
final.
however,
mr.
justice
scalia,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
did
not
apply
the
law
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
which,
as
this
court
held
in
rivers
v.
roadway
express
and
recently
in
the
bousley
case,
is...
is
from
the
time
of
an
action
what
the
highest
court
of...
of
the
state
says
it
is.
that's
been
the--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--only
in
one
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
would
be
in
the
situation,
as
in
wainwright
v.
stone,
where
the
judicial
application
to
the
statute
over
a
long
period
gave
consistent
notice
to
our
citizens
that
their
conduct
would
violate...
would
be
violative
of
the
statute
in
keeping
with
judicial
construction.
now,
in
wainwright,
there
were
50
years
of
judicial
construction
to
alert
those
individuals
that
their
conduct
was
in
fact
proscribed.
this
was
the...
the
fiore
ruling
was,
in
fact,
a
first
ruling
under
the
statute
and
it
was
a...
a
judicial
misconstruction
of
the
first
order.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
your
honor,
if
there
had
been
no
intervening
law
by
our
state
supreme
court,
i
would
be
making
precisely
this
argument.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
not
necessarily.
as
i
said,
if
there
had
been
intervening
decisions,
again...
and
habeas
lies
to
see
whether
the
state
would
be
taxed
by
the
change,
which
i
submit
to
you
is
not
really
a
change.
it's
just
a
new
decision.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
taxed.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
state
would
be
taxed
by
retrials
and
a
floodgate
problem
and
so
forth.
there
was
none
of
that
in--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--yes.
there
is
none
of
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
your
honor,
there's
a
good
argument
i
believe
for
mr....
for
mr.
fiore
because
he
is
presumed
innocent
under
that
other
section.
he
is
cloaked
with
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
they
should
have
tried
him
under
that
other
provision,
and
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
it
is
a
case,
in
fact,
of
innocent
conduct
of
the
charge
that
was
charged.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
yes,
your
honor.
that's
wainwright
v.
stone,
which
is
the
case
that
the
respondent
principally
uses
to
defend.
it's
a
case
which
this
court
decided
i
believe
in
1972.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
i'm
not
exactly
sure
that...
that
it
would
be,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
it
would
be
then
the
same
position
as
in...
in
wright
v.
west,
where
we
would
still
test.
if
there
was
a
sufficiency
claim,
we
would
still
test
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no,
that's
not
the
argument
we're
making
here.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
your
honor,
i...
i
can't
admit
that
because
teague
only
applies
to
procedural
matters.
this
is
clearly
a
substantive
matter
which
decriminalized
behavior.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
your
honor,
that...
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
if
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had
not
spoken,
we
would
be
here
under
jackson
and
wright
v.
west
and
sullivan
v.
louisiana
and
that
ilk
of
case.
however,
our
case
is
not
worse
in
any
sense.
i
submit
to
you
respectfully,
it's
better
because
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
spoken.
it's
their
duty,
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
case
comes
before
them,
whenever,
to
define
the
elements,
and
when
they
do
that,
as...
as
a
concurrence
said
in
bousley,
that's
not
really
retroactivity.
that's
explanatory
behavior.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
your
honor,
but
our
case
law
in
pennsylvania
is
identical
under
recently
decided
pennsylvania
supreme
court
authority
in
commonwealth
v.
shaffer.
but
you
can
look
back
to
see
how
judge
aldisert
in
the
third
circuit,
in
the
ettinger
case,
for
example,
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
briefs,
took
this
same
route
and
said
the
statute
is
what
it
was
from
the
time
the
highest
court
in
the
state
construes
it.
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no.
your
honor,
we
didn't
get
relief
in
pennsylvania
because
of
a
malfunction
in
the
law.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
i
apologize.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
i
stand
corrected,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
it
does.
i
misspoke.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no,
your
honor.
only
in
the...
the
extreme
situation
where
you
have
actual
innocence
as
the
gateway,
coupled
with
a
fundamental
constitutional
error
which
went
to--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--i
would
say
no,
your
honor,
because
if
you
had
made
a
decision
on
this
court,
that
would
be
a
decision
that...
that
those
convictions
earlier
were
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
whereas
later
they
were
not.
and
i...
there
have
been
so
few--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--well--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that...
that
a
habeas
writ
would
lie
if
you
decriminalized
behavior.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
absolutely,
yes.
i
believe
this...
this
case
derives
at
least
from
one...
derives
from
at
least
one
bousley
principle,
which
is
the
state
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
mr.
chief
justice,
i...
i
agree
except
when
the
error
in
state
law
is
also
an
error
of
federal
constitutional
dimension.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
we
have...
we
have
a
statement,
your
honor,
from
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
both...
excuse
me...
from
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
the
scarpone
case
that
there
was
an
error
of
state
law,
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute
which
in
fact
was
also
a
jackson
error,
although
the
state
admittedly
did
not
say
jackson.
but
what
they
said
was
that
the
commonwealth
did
not
make
out
the
crime.
it
was
a
pure
sufficiency
problem.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
and
that
is
precisely
the
narrow
holding
in
this
case
that
would
only
release
one
person,
as
far
as
i
know,
that
we're
asking
for--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--no,
your
honor,
of
course
not.
unless
we're
in
the
very
limited
zone
of...
of
insufficiency
of
evidence
at
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
correct.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
correct.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
it
was
stating
the
law
from
the
time
it
was
enacted.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
at
that
time,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that...
that
a
federal
court
could...
could
look
to
that
intermediate
ruling
as
datum
for
a...
a
construction
of
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
might
or
might
not
say
later.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
if
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
the
decision
was
prospective
only,
i
think
that...
that
a
federal
court
would
have
to
defer
to
it,
but
would
have
to
have
the
final
say
on
the
constitutional
meaning
of
the
decision.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--correct.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
yes.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
correct.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
that's
the
only
case.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
yes.
yes,
it's
sort
of
a
different
issue.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
that's
also
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
present...
we're...
we're
squarely
within
the...
the
goals
of
congress
in
the
recent
legislation
because
what
congress
has
said
is
that
there's
deference,
but
not
to
the
extent
that
a
state
court
decision
runs
afoul
of
clearly
stated
federal
constitutional
law,
which
we
have
in
a
whole
train
of
cases,
such
as
jackson,
such
as
winship,
and/or
the...
there
is
a
case
to
be
made
that
the
state
court...
that
the
state...
and
i'm
paraphrasing...
that
the
state
court's
decision
is
unreasonable
on
the
facts,
which
it
is
fundamentally
unreasonable
on
the
facts
here.
there's
nothing
that
arises
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
would
suggest
that
mr.
fiore
or
mr.
scarpone
did
not
have
a
permit.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
quite
the
opposite.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no,
no.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
well,
i
would
say
if...
if
we're
in
an
actual
innocence
situation
with
a
fundamental
defect
going
to
the
truth-finding
function
of
the
trial,
then
i
would
say
every
case.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
not...
no,
your
honor,
not
if
it
were
simply
a
procedural
matter.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
under
the
law,
as
i
understand
it,
as
congress
has
passed
it,
if
there
is
a
clearly
stated
constitutional
decision
of
this
case
in
the
background
which
would
be
controlling,
then
my
answer
would
be
yes.
in
other
words,
jackson
is
there.
so,
in...
in
this
case
specifically,
my
answer
would
be
yes.
but
if
someone
is
coming
up
with
a...
a
new
substantive
right
or
a
substantive
right
that
doesn't
go
to
guilt
or
innocence,
then
perhaps
i
would
say
no.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
allow
me
to
clarify.
what
i
was...
what
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
scalia
was
my
view
of
a
certain
hypothetical
situation.
it
was
not
my
view
of
this
case.
this
case
can
be
decided
narrowly
on
the
basis
that
you
have
stated,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
is
the
basis--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--i
think
that's
a
correct
statement,
and
i
think
it's...
it's
emphatically
a
correct
statement
with
regard
to
the
lower
court
decision
in
commonwealth
v.
fiore.
the
superior
court
decision
is
a
memorandum
decision
in
our
state,
and
if
any
lawyer
looks
it
up,
which...
it
appears
at
563
atlantic
2nd
189,
he
or
she
will
be
instructed
that
these
memorandum
opinions
cannot
be
considered
as
precedent,
nor
can
they
be
cited
for
any
purpose.
your
honor,
this
is
perhaps
the
only
case...
the
only
court
where
i...
where
a
lawyer
could
even
speak
about
that
decision.
it
is
not
a
rule.
it
is
not
authoritative.
it
is
not
anything
that
any
other
pennsylvania
practitioner
or,
if
you
will,
defendant
or
prosecutor
could
make
anything
of.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
i
want
you--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--under
pennsylvania
law,
it
is
a...
retroactive
is
the
best
word
we
have.
i
would
say
yes.
but...
but
there
is
another
view
which
i
believe
justice
stevens
has...
has
espoused
that
it's
not...
it's
explanatory.
it's...
it's
a
very
limited,
specialized
type
of
retroactivity,
which
merely
explains
the
statute.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
my
client,
your
honor--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--your
honor,
he
was
justly
convicted
on
some
other
counts,
and
we
haven't
challenged
those.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
this...
this
count--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--your
honor,
this...
this
was--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--i
don't
think--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--your
honor--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--because
pennsylvania
was
in
grave
error
at
that
time,
your
honor,
in
one...
one
case.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
no.
it
was
applying
settled
pennsylvania
as
well
as
constitutional
principles.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
i...
i
believe
you...
that
a
federal
court
would
have
to
defer
and
look
to
that,
but
in
that
case,
which
is
not
this
case,
it
would
still
have
to
apply
jackson
and
winship
standards
in
a
sufficiency
claim.
may
i
reserve
any
time
that
i
have
remaining?
mr.
james
b.
lieber
thank
you.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
in
that
time,
your
honor,
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
distortion
of
the
meaning
of
a
statute
is
not
a
rule,
and
for
purposes
of
retroactive...
retroactivity
analysis,
if
that's
what
we're
in,
you
need
a
new
rule
and
an
old
rule.
there
was
no
old
rule
here
under
pennsylvania
law.
there
was
no
foreshadowing.
the
foreshadowing
quite
clearly
was
to
scarpone.
the
regulations
taught
everyone
in
pennsylvania
in
this
industry
what
it
meant
to
have
a
license
and
what
it
meant
to
have
one
revoked.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that...
that
if
it
counts
at
all,
it
counts
very
slightly
and
only
to
the
extent
that
there...
it
shows
the
necessity
for
habeas
review
in
a
federal
court.
but
it
shows
nothing
about
the
merits
or
the
judgment
of
the
merits
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
because
they
are
a
certiorari-like
court.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
yes.
he
cannot
be...
this
is...
this
is
not
the
case
where
someone
has
procedurally
defaulted.
this...
this
individual--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--i
would
respectfully
disagree.
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
a
part
of
our
constitution
in
pennsylvania,
your
honor.
we
have
that
in
all
of
our
trials.
this
is
very
much
of
an
unusual
situation.
i've
never
seen
one
quite
like
it
where
two
individuals
at
the
same
trial
on
the
same
facts
get
two--
mr.
james
b.
lieber
--your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
james
b.
lieber
thank
you,
your
honor.
