unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lieber,
i
suppose
that
the
highest
court
of
pennsylvania
has
determined
that
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offense,
it
was
an
offense
and
that
they
later
interpreted
the
statute,
but
didn't
give
it
retroactive
effect.
is
that
what
they've
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
had
three
different
opportunities
to
take
up
mr.
fiore's
case
presumably.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
case
became
final
if
they
took...
did
not
take
it
on
certiorari.
the
fact
is
your
client
has
been
convicted,
finally
convicted,
by
the
pennsylvania
state
courts
of
being
guilty
of
this
crime.
isn't
that...
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
in
light
of
what
you've
just
said
and
in
justice...
in
light
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had,
indeed,
held
that
the
law
was
as
the
lower
courts
thought
it
was;
that
is,
even
if
you
had
a
permit,
if
you
flagrantly
violated
it,
it
was
as
though
you
had
none?
suppose
that
was
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
precedent
and
then
in
scarpone's
case,
the
supreme
court
overruled
that
precedent.
would
your
position
be
different
than
it
is
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you...
if...
if
mr.
fiore
had
been
convicted
like,
say,
5
years
ago
under
the
statute
and
5
years
later
a
new
case
arose
with
the
same
kind
of
facts
and
was
decided
as
scarpone's
case
was
decided,
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course--
--you're
asking
for...
you're
asking
for
a
very
broad
rule
then,
that
no
matter
how
much
time
has
gone
by
and
in
the...
your
client's
conviction
had
become
final
on
direct
appeal
and
presumably
many
years
later,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
were
to
decide
that
there
is
an...
an
element
of
the
offense
missing,
your
client
still
would
be
entitled
to
relief.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
habeas
lies
to
see
whether
the
state
would
be
what
by
the
change?
unknown
speaker
taxed?
unknown
speaker
inconvenienced,
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
two
things
about
that.
first,
isn't
there
a
good
argument
that
he
could
have
been
charged
and
indicted
under
a
related
section,
that
he
was
violating
the
terms
of
the
permit?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
let's
assume
that...
that
he
altered
the
pipe
and
that
pollution
was
coming
out
of
the
pipe,
et
cetera.
assume
that.
wouldn't
the
state
have
had
a
good
argument...
wouldn't
the
state
have
had
a
good
argument
that
he
could
be
tried
under
that
other
provision?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then...
then
this
is
not
a
case
of
innocent
conduct.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
recognize
that.
you
mentioned
the
wainwright
case.
can
you
tell
me
what
that
case
is?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
it's
not
a
commonwealth
case.
okay,
thank
you.
may
i
just
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
modify
it
slightly?
if
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
had
held
in
your
client's
case
that,
in
fact,
he
was
properly
charged
and
then,
as
odd
as
it
might
be,
let's
say
a
month
later
it
went
the
other
way
in
the
co-defendant's
case,
then
your
position
here
would
be
different,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
sufficiency
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
is
essentially
a
claim
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
simply
because
it
was,
under
pennsylvania
law,
evidence
that
could
not,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
as
a
matter
of
law,
prove
the...
the
offense
that
he
was
charged
with,
i.e.,
operating
without
a
permit,
as
opposed
to
operating
in
violation
of
a
permit.
so,
the
point
that
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
if
in
his
case,
in
your
client's
case,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
said,
yes,
properly
charged,
the
evidence
in
fact
is
relevant
and
sufficient
to
convict,
and
then
a
month
later
in
the
co-defendant's
case,
they
said,
no,
the...
the
charge
to
which
this...
this
evidence
was
relevant
could
only
have
been
the
charge
of
operating
in
violation
of
a
permit,
it
seems
to
me
your
position
would
have
to
be
different
because
you
would
be...
in
order
for
your
client
to
get
relief,
you
would
have
to
argue
that
there...
that
we
should
adopt
a
federal
rule
requiring
the
states
to
apply
a
decision,
as
in
the
co-defendant's
case,
retroactively.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
not
the
argument
you're
making
here.
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
you'd
run...
you
would...
i
assume
you
admit
you
would
run
into
a
teague
problem
if...
if
you
were
in
the
situation
of
my
hypo
in
which
you
were
asking
for
a
federal
rule
requiring
state
retroactivity.
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
the
situation
be
any
different
than
if
we
had
a
legislature
saying
the
permit
is
not
an
essential
element,
and
then
the
legislature
changed
that
to
say
it
is?
if...
if
you
have
a
permit,
you
have
to
show
that
you
don't
have
a
permit.
why
isn't
the
highest
court
of
the
state
declaring
the
law
the
same
as
the
legislature
declaring
the
law,
and
then
when
the
high
court
changes
it,
it's
like
a
legislative
change
that
doesn't
have
to
be
retroactive.
i
thought
that
you
had
to
make
that
concession
and
that
you
were
relying
on
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
never
having
addressed
this
question,
never
having
settled
what
the
state
law
was.
unknown
speaker
bousley,
however,
was
a
federal...
construing
a
federal
statute
where
the...
perhaps
the
case
law
may
be
somewhat
different
than
just
stepping
into
a
state
situation.
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
the
pennsylvania
law
supported
you,
you
should
have
gotten
relief
in
pennsylvania.
the
fact
you
didn't
suggests
that
it
does
not
support
you.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
a
somewhat
pejorative
description.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
i
think
you
misstated
the
holding
in
shaffer.
they
didn't
say
it
was
the
law
from
the
date
of
the
supreme
court
decision.
as
i
understood
it,
they
said
it
was
the
date...
it
was
the
law
from
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
which
makes
a
world
of
difference.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
most
of
the
cases
that
we
take
in
this
court
are
cases
that
involve
circuit
conflicts,
disagreements
in
the
law,
in
final
decisions
in
most
cases,
some
of
them
years
ago.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
every
time
we
resolve
such
a
circuit
conflict,
the
constitution
requires
that
all
of
those
who
have
been
finally
convicted,
under
the
side
of
the
conflict
that
has
lost
here,
are
entitled
to...
to
be
released?
unknown
speaker
well,
take
that
kind
of
a
situation,
limited
to
those
cases
where
we
have
interpreted
a
substantive
statute
in
a
certain
way,
and
one
set
of
courts
in
cases,
some
of
them
decided
years
ago,
have
interpreted
that
same
statute
a
different
way,
which
would...
which
would
make
a
conduct
that
we
have
held
to
be
innocent
in
fact
guilty.
now,
are
all
of
those
who
were...
who
were
convicted
under
that
interpretation
entitled
to
be
released?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
that.
we
didn't
make
any
such
decision,
as
you
know.
unknown
speaker
there
are
two
sets
of
cases.
one
of
them
say,
for
conviction
of
this...
of
this
offense,
you
need
x.
the
other
set
says
for
conviction
of
this
offense,
you
don't
need
x.
and...
and
the
lower
courts
are
in
conflict.
some
of
these
cases
are
very
old.
we...
we
take
a
recent
case
and
we
say
in
fact
you
need
x.
what
happens
to
all...
for
the
substantive
offense.
what
happens
to
all
of
the
cases
that
said
you
don't
need
x?
unknown
speaker
mr....
justice
scalia
is
asking
you
whether
you
think
bousley
was
correctly
decided,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
but
bousley...
the...
you
can...
our
cases
say
you
can
get
relief
from
a
federal
conviction
on
habeas
because
of
an
error
in
statutory
law,
and
the...
the
same
is
not
nearly
as
clear
when
you're
talking
about
a
claimed
error
in
state
law.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
have
any
evidence
from
any
statement
of
a
pennsylvania
court
that
there
has
been
an
error
in
pennsylvania
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
court
didn't
have
to
get
into
federal
constitutional
law.
all
it
had
to
do
was
construe
its
own
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
win
on
a
rule
as
narrow
as
this.
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
court
holds
that
the
statute,
as
they
construed
it,
clearly,
inarguably,
always
meant
that,
that
there
was
no
room
for
reasonable
disagreement,
that
somebody
had
just
made
an
inexcusable
error
in
construing
it
otherwise
in
prior
cases,
when
that
happens,
which
you
are
claiming
happened
here,
then
you
win
because
you
can
take
advantage
of
the
settled
federal
rule
to
the
effect
that
every
element
has
got
to
be
proved.
you
don't
have
to
have
any
broader
holding
from
this
court
than
that,
as
i
understand
it,
for
you
to
win
here.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
any
worse
than
the
situation
where
you
have
a
lower
state
court
that...
that
clearly,
unarguably,
whatever...
whatever
other
adverbs
justice
souter
used--
[laughter]
--got
the
statute
wrong?
it...
it
reads
red
in
the
statute
to
mean
blue.
it's
just
absolutely,
clearly
wrong
on
its
face,
and
that
person,
you
know,
is
finally
convicted.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
denies
certiorari.
we
deny
certiorari.
is
he
constitutionally
entitled
to...
to
release...
to
be
released
because
the
statute
has
simply
been
construed
flatly,
clearly,
inarguably
wrong?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you...
when
you
say
insufficiency
of
evidence,
you're
talking
about
evidence
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
cannot
prove
an
element
of
an
offense.
right?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
your
real
argument
is
they...
that
you
take
advantage,
in
effect,
of
the
winship
rule
or
you...
you
refer
to
it
by...
by
citing
jackson.
that's
the
rule
that
you're...
you're...
you're
resting
your
case
on.
so,
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
if
the
red/blue
distinction
made
the
difference
between
an
element
and
a
non-element,
you
would
take
advantage
of
it,
and
you
would
make
your
winship
argument.
if
it
didn't
go
to
an
element,
you
or
whoever
was
arguing
would
lose.
right?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
when
the
supreme
court
decided
your
client's...
or
rather
decided
the
other...
your
co-defendant's
case,
whether
it
was
stating
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
or
whether
it
was
changing
the
law
from
an
intermediate
court
view
that
prevailed
in
the
interim.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
pennsylvania's
supreme
court
has
said
that's
what...
what
the
view
is
on
the
first
construction
of
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
were
the
other
way
around.
suppose,
first,
a
state
intermediate
court
said,
this
decision
is
prospective
only.
what...
what
would
the
posture
of
the
case
be
then?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
suppose
then
the
state
supreme
court
said,
our
decision
is
prospective
only.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
final
say
on
whether
or
not
there's
a
due
process
violation--
unknown
speaker
--for--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
if
they
said
it
was
prospective
only,
then
your
co-defendant
would
remain
in
jail.
it
wouldn't
apply
even
to
him
if
they
had
said
that
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
would
have
both
been
treated
alike.
unknown
speaker
yes.
or
they
could
apply
it
to
this...
the
case
before
it
and
all
future
cases
but
no
past
cases,
which
is
something
this
court
once
did.
has
any
state
supreme
court
ever
said
that
other...
that
you've
found
other
than
the
georgia
court
in
wainwright
and
stone?
unknown
speaker
and
even
wainwright
and
stone
was
a
notice
vagueness
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
there's
no
equal
protection
claim
being
made
here--
unknown
speaker
--bousley
was...
was
decided
under
current
habeas
law.
i
guess
you
can
argue
whether
it
was
constitutional
or
not.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
on
its
face...
it
isn't
clear
that
it's
constitutional
anyway.
but
i
suppose
it
is
your
position
that
if
congress
said
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
issue
to
overturn
a...
a
prior
conviction
simply
because
the
law
under
which
that
conviction
was
obtained
is
later...
is
later
amended,
either
by
the
legislature
or
by
the
courts
of
the
state,
you
would
say
that
would
be
invalid
at
least
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
also
say
that
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
every...
every
state
court
decision
that
is
unreasonable
on
the
facts
is
unconstitutional?
and...
and
you
can
get
habeas
relief--
unknown
speaker
--many
years
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
it
then?
unknown
speaker
you
keep
broadening--
--excuse
me.
your
answer
is
yes,
then.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
if
it's
a
substantive
matter,
you
say
every
case
where
the
defendant
says
the
factual
finding
was
simply
unreasonable,
you
can
bring
a
federal
habeas
action,
a
successful
one,
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
that
i
don't
understand
about
your
argument
is...
and
it
goes
back
to
my
earlier
question.
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
thing
you
need
to
win
this
case
is
a
determination
by
us
that
what
the
pennsylvania
courts
did,
in
the
case
of
the
co-defendant,
was
to
make
a
decision,
a
ruling
about
an
element
of
the
offense.
number
two,
for
us
to
determine
that
that
ruling
about
the
element
of
the
offense
was
not
in
any
sense
new
law
or
the
clarification
of
any
legitimate
or
reasonable
confusion
that
existed
beforehand,
that
what
it
was
declaring
was
what
any...
any
reasonable
and
careful
reader
would
always
have
said.
and
number
three,
the
rule
in
winship
or
jackson,
to
the
effect
that
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
has
got
to
prove
every
element
of
the
offense
stated.
as
i
understand
it,
that's
all
your
argument
need
consist
of.
but
you
broaden
it,
and
you
just
broadened
it
in
your
response
to
justice
scalia
when
you
say
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
relief
if
the
error
went
to
the...
i
think
you
put
it
the
truth-finding
function.
and
i
don't
understand.
i'm
missing
something
i
guess
because
i
don't
understand
why
you're
broadening
your...
your
argument
and,
in
effect,
requiring
a
broader
rule
than
i
thought
you
were
requiring.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
was
lay
down
the
law?
it
wasn't
a
question
of
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
they
called
it
a
bald
fiction
to
say
that
when
you
had
a
permit,
you
could
be
treated
as
not
having
a
permit.
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
anything
matter-of-fact.
they
were
resolving
for
the
first
time
a
question
of
what
the
elements
of
these
events
were.
and
i
didn't
know
that
lower
court
decisions,
one
way
or
another,
count
as
the
law
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
us
to
assume
that
under
pennsylvania
law
this
decision,
the
scarpone
decision,
is
retroactive--
unknown
speaker
--under
pennsylvania
law?
unknown
speaker
what
was
your
client
sent
to
jail
for
if
it
was
not
for
a
violation
of
pennsylvania
law?
unknown
speaker
you're...
you're
telling
me
the...
the
fiore
decision
doesn't
mean
anything
simply
because
it
can't
be
cited
in
future
cases.
he
was
surely
sent
to
prison
for
violating
pennsylvania
law.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
this
count.
this
count.
unknown
speaker
he
was
sent
to
prison
for
violating...
why
was
he
sent
to
prison
here?
you're
telling
me
that
this
thing
has
no
effect
in
pennsylvania?
it...
it
is
not
law
in
pennsylvania?
you
can
be
sent
to
prison
when
you
haven't
violated
any
law?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
issue.
[laughter]
well--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
the
issue...
the
issue
is...
the
issue
is
whether
pennsylvania
deemed
him
to
have
been
in
violation
of
pennsylvania
law.
counsel
is
telling
us
pennsylvania
didn't
deem
the
law
to
have
been
violated.
this
case
is
not
citable.
unknown
speaker
why
was
pennsylvania
sending
him
to
jail
then?
unknown
speaker
one
court
was.
isn't
it...
once
again,
instead
of
saying
that...
instead
of
arguing
or
conceding
that
you're
asking
for
a
limited
retroactivity,
it
seems
to
me
all
you
have
to
say
is
you
are
asking
this
court
to
recognize
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
the
companion
case
was
not
making
any
change
in
the
law.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
that...
in
the
scarpone
case
had
said
this
decision
is
not
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
lieber.
unknown
speaker
mr.
graci,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now
is...
don't
you,
in
making
that
statement
of
the
question,
assume
that
it
was...
that
the
law
changed
when
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
made
its
decision
in
the
other
case?
unknown
speaker
supposing
in
that
opinion
they
had
said,
this
is
our
understanding
of
what
the
statute
means
and
they
had
added
a
sentence,
and
we
think
it
has
meant
this
ever
since
it
was
enacted,
then
you
would
lose,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
he
also
cites
the
shaffer
case.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
question
that
if
this
was
a
law-changing
decision,
if
there
had
been
a
prior
decision
going
the
other
way,
then
you
would
win.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
if
it
was
retroactive...
if
the
state
court
could
say,
this
is
a
new
rule
that
does...
the
old
rule
was
to
the
contrary
and
we
don't
effect
the
old
rule.
but
my
question
is
supposing
they
say...
and
i
think
if
you
read
this
against
shaffer,
they
in
effect
have
said...
this
is
what
the
statute
meant
ever
since
it
was
enacted.
then
it
really
isn't
retroactive.
it's
just
stating
what
the
law
was
and
this
fellow
was
improperly
convicted
under...
under
the
statute
as
enacted.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
specifically
said
it
would
not
be...
it
would
not
be
retroactive...
because
it
was
a
law-changing
decision.
unknown
speaker
am...
am
i
right,
mr.
graci,
in
thinking
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
granted
review
in
scarpone's
case
because
there
was
a
split
between
the
commonwealth
court
and
the
superior
court
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
graci,
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
pennsylvania,
as
a
matter
of...
of
state
procedure,
will...
will
not
apply
the
decision,
we'll
say,
retroactively,
in
quotes,
to...
to
this
case.
the
thing
i
want
to
be
clear
on,
i
guess,
is
whether
you
agree
with
a
premise
of
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
a
moment
ago.
his
premise,
of
course,
was
that
this
was
not
a
law-changing
decision.
and
do
you
agree
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
did
not
treat
the
ruling
in
scarpone
as
a
law-changing
decision?
and
let
me...
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is
this.
i
don't
have
the...
the
pennsylvania
opinion
in
front
of
me,
but
i
think
they
used
the
phrase
in
describing
the...
the
view
that
was
taken
in
the
fiore
case
as
resting
on
a
bald
fiction.
i
read
that
to
mean
that
they
say,
no
one
could
reasonably
read
the
statute
to
mean
this.
and
do
you...
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
they
made
it
clear
that
this
was
not
a
law-changing
decision.
do
you
agree
that
it
was
not
a
law-changing
decision
in
scarpone?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
the
hypothetical
that...
or
i
guess
the
question
that
i'm
asking
you
is,
is
this
in
a
third
category
in
which
it
was
a
new
decision
in
the
sense
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
had
never
ruled
on
it
before?
and
two,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
reasonable
disagreement
before
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
said
when
it
referred
to
the
alternative
view
as
a
bald
fiction.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
it...
is
it
a
law-changing
decision
when
it
is,
a,
the
first
one
and,
b,
the
court
in
making
the
first
decision
says,
anything
else
would
be
a
bald
fiction?
is
that
a
law-changing
decision?
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
shorter
answer
was
the
better
one
in
that
case,
but--
[laughter]
why...
why
is
it...
why
is
it
a
changing
decision
when...
when
the
court
says
what
it
said?
unknown
speaker
it's...
it's
new
simply
because
they
had
never
taken
up
the
question
before.
right?
that's
what
you
mean
by
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
every
issue...
you're
assuming
that
every...
i
think,
every
issue
of
first
impression
presents
a
new
decision...
or
rather,
announces
new
law
for
the
purposes
of
a
federal
court
in
applying
the
winship
rule.
i
think
that's
what
you're
assuming.
unknown
speaker
any...
any
first
decision
of
the
state's
highest
court
is
announcing
new
law
for
purposes
of
winship.
i
think
that's
your
assumption.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
cannot
always
be
questioned.
sometimes
the
statutory
law
in
these
cases
is
so
clear
that
no
one
can
reasonably
question
what
it
means.
and
i
think...
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
was
saying,
with
its
bald
fiction
remark,
that
that's
what
we
had
here.
sure,
people...
you
know,
people
make
mistakes,
but
the
fact
is
you
couldn't
reasonably
make
this
mistake.
i
think
that's
what
they
were
saying.
and
if
that's
what
they
were
saying,
it
seems
to
me
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
were
not
making
a
law-changing
decision.
they
were
saying
there's
nothing
new
in
what
we're
saying.
it
was
right
there
on
the
statute
books.
isn't...
isn't
that
a
fair
reading?
unknown
speaker
is...
is
there
anything
in
our
cases
that
defines
the
term
law-changing
decisions?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
what
do
you
think
it...
it
would
be
if,
indeed,
it...
it
was
obvious
it
couldn't
be
interpreted
any
other
way,
but
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
chooses
to
embrace
the
fiction
and
does
interpret
it
the
other
way,
says
that
blue
means
red?
now,
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
law-changing
decision?
i
guess,
we've
got
to
figure
this
out
case
by
case
as
to
how
obvious
a
statute
was
and
how
wrong
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
is.
unknown
speaker
no.
that's
all
right.
i...
i'd
like
to
know
your
calculation
of...
of
what
happens
if
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had...
had
agreed
with
the
fiore
interpretation
when
the
case
finally
came
to
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
have
been
a
law-changing
decision
or
not
a
law-changing
decision?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
justice
souter
would
consider
it
a
law-changing
decision?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
so,
what--
unknown
speaker
--my...
my
one
question
is
what
pennsylvania
case...
this
is
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law,
pure
and
simple.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
what
pennsylvania
case
do
you
want
me
to
read
on
the
question
that
justices
souter
and
stevens
have
asked?
as
i've
read
them
so
far,
i
get
out
of
shaffer
the
notion
that
ordinarily
under
pennsylvania
law,
ordinarily
when
the
supreme
court
interprets
a
statute,
a
substantive,
not
a
procedural
one,
they're
making
law
for
all
time.
they're
saying,
this
is
what
the
law
has
always
been.
that's
the
ordinary
case.
then
you
have
a
couple
of
cases
like
schreiber
and
tedarro
which
say,
now,
we'll
tell
you
what
a
new
law
is.
a
new
law
is
a
break
with
past
precedent
or
deciding
something
that
isn't
clearly
foreshadowed,
just
exactly
what
you
said.
so...
and
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
whether
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case,
which
happened
to
say
nothing
about
it,
didn't
say
a
word...
we
could
ask
them
i
guess,
but
they
didn't
say
a
word...
didn't
say
a
word.
what
did
they
have
in
mind?
they
used
the
word,
well,
my
goodness,
this
statute
is
sort
of
like
saying
horse
theft
and
you
convict
somebody
for
stealing
a
cow.
i
mean,
bald
fiction
suggests
that,
but
they
didn't
say
it.
so,
what
pennsylvania
case
do
you
want
me
to
read
that
will
be
most
favorable
to
you
on
what
counts
as
a
new
rule
as
opposed
to
interpretation
law
for
all
time?
unknown
speaker
kuchinic
seemed
to
be
a
case
in
which
they
simply
assumed...
and
it
was
a
new
rule.
it
was
a
break
with
past
precedent.
so,
that
won't
help.
unknown
speaker
blackwell.
unknown
speaker
blackwell
was
the
second
one?
unknown
speaker
no.
what
was
the
first
one?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
one--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
but,
counsel--
unknown
speaker
--counsel--
unknown
speaker
--if
you...
if
you
took
it
in
the
context
of
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
in
this
case,
first,
they
said,
no
doubt
these
people
have
engaged
in
execrable
conduct,
but
the
one
thing
that
they
clearly
have
not
done
is
operate
without
a
permit.
to
say
otherwise
would
be
a
bald
fiction.
and
then
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
went
on
and
said,
we
think
that
the
attorney
general
would
have
had
a
nice
case
under
this
other
section
which
is
even
a
stronger
offense
than
the
one
that
they
were
prosecuted
for.
so,
if
you
followed
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said,
you
would
still
be
free
to
prosecute
fiore,
would
you
not,
for
a
violation
of
that
provision
that
says
if
you
intentionally
dispose
of
a
hazardous
waste
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
act
and
cause
a
public
nuisance,
public
nuisance
specifically
defined
to
include
violation
of
any
term
of
a
permit,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
effect
said,
you
picked
the
wrong
crime.
there's
another
crime
in
there
that
you
could
have
indicted
him
for,
and
the
penalty
would
have
been
at
least
as
strong.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
mr.
graci,
so
much
of
this
seems
to
turn
upon
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
thought
it
was
doing.
does
pennsylvania
have
a
certification
procedure
whereby
it
can
answer
a
certified
question
from...
from
federal
courts
concerning
pennsylvania
law?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
position,
as
a
state...
representing
the
state
attorney
general,
as
to
what
the
state
should
do
if
you
have
a
case
like
this
and
the
supreme
court
says
it
is
retroactive,
but
the
judgment
of
somebody
in
fiore's
position
is
final?
as
a
matter
of
policy,
what
should
happen?
unknown
speaker
the
pennsylvania
court
says
this
is
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
that.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
said...
suppose
it
said
this
was
always
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
are
not
changing
the
law.
unknown
speaker
no.
as
a
matter
of
what
should
happen
under
pennsylvania
law
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
because
the
judgment
is
final?
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
is
a
decision
of
this
court,
some
other
factual
situation,
in
which
the
conduct
for
which
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
and
he
has
a
final
conviction
is
declared
constitutionally
protected
and
he's
picketing
or
something
like
that.
same
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
teague
is
a
question
of
the
extent
of
our
remedies.
i'm
talking
about
whether
it's
permissible
under
state
law
to
hold
the
person.
suppose
we
have
said
the
conduct
is
constitutionally
protected
and
this
is
a
new
decision
in
the
sense
that
we'd
never
addressed
it
before,
but
we--
unknown
speaker
--then
what
would
you
do
with
a
prisoner
who
has
been
convicted
and
whose
conviction
is
final?
unknown
speaker
why
should
this
case
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
from
the
standpoint
of
the
prisoner,
what's
the
difference
between
prisoner
a,
whose
conduct
was
constitutionally
protected,
and
prisoner
b,
whom
we'll
assume
by...
by
hypothesis
committed
an
act
which
was
never
criminal
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania?
what's
the
real
difference?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
what...
what
your
position
is
and
what
the
law
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
is
in
these
two
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
want
you
to
assume
that
it
was...
that
the
state
supreme
court
said
the
statute
has
always
meant
that
you
must
have
a
permit.
it's
not
a...
we're
not
changing
law.
it
has
meant
this
from
the
day
it
was
enacted.
what's
the
difference
in
releasing,
as
i
take
it
your
courts
would,
the
prisoner
in
the
first
hypothetical,
whose
conduct
constitutionally
protected,
and
the
second
case
where
he
was
convicted
for
an
act
that
was
never
criminal?
unknown
speaker
i
just...
i
recognize
we're
here
under
teague.
what
i
really
want
to
know
is
what
ought
to
be
the
policy
of
the
state,
because
teague
may
well
allow
people
to
remain
in
jail
even
though
they
had
a...
a
valid
defense
at
one
time
because
of
the
passage
of
time.
i
want
to
know
what
ought
to
be
the
difference
in
these
two
cases
under
state
law.
and
i
don't
see
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
might
i
just
interrupt?
because
i'm
still
concerned
about
the
difference
between
justice
kennedy's
two
hypotheticals.
has
it
not
always
been
the
law
that
one
may
not
be
validly
convicted
of
a
crime
unless
every
element
proscribed
in
the
statute
prohibiting
the
conduct,
unless
every
element
of
the
offense
has
been
proved?
and
is
it
not
the
law
of
pennsylvania
that
this
crime
required
the
person
not
have
a
permit?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
your...
your
submission
is
that
there
was
a
period
of
time
under
this
statute
where
it
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
even
though
the
person
had
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
can
simply
prescribe
whether
things
will
be
retroactive
or
not
and
thereby
affect
federal
constitutional
proscriptions?
i
mean,
suppose
we...
suppose
we
disagree
with
your
contention
and...
and
we
say
that
since
this
was
retroactive,
the
law
was
always
such,
this
individual
has
to
be
released.
do
you
think
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
could
change
all
that
by
simply
announcing,
this
will...
this
particular
decision
will
not
be
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
a
very
fragile,
indeed
useless
constitutional
protection
if
it
can
be
avoided
by
the
state
supreme
court
by
simply
the
supreme
court
saying,
ah,
fiore...
since
we
want
fiore
held
in
jail
and
other
people
in
fiore's
position,
we're
just
going
to
announce
that
this
one
is
not
retroactive.
i
mean,
what
kind
of
constitutional
protection
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
an
indicator.
i
take
it
your
view
is
a
bread
and
butter
issue
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
interpreting
a
statute,
a
bread
and
butter,
fairly
tough,
not
too
tough,
medium,
that
automatically
those
things
are
all
considered
new
rules
in
pennsylvania
and
they're
not
considered
to
have
always
been
the
law.
now,
if
that's
the
way
pennsylvania
works,
i
guess
you
could
find
some
cases,
which
i
haven't
found,
where
on
collateral
state
review,
even
after
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision,
the
habeas
court,
state,
applies
a
different
rule.
found
an
example
of
that?
i
mean,
that
would
be
true
if
that's
the
pennsylvania
rule,
that
bread
and
butter
issues
don't
apply
retroactively.
if
that's
so,
then
in
the
thousands
of
instances
where
they've
interpreted
state
criminal
law...
you
see...
do
i
need
to
repeat
it?
do
you
see
my
question?
unknown
speaker
i
couldn't
find
any,
which
suggested
to
me
that
it
was
really
the
unusual
case
that's
non-retroactive.
unknown
speaker
yes,
there
are
some,
but
normally
if
it's
not
going
to
apply
as
the
law
forever,
the
state
supreme
court
will
say
it.
unknown
speaker
normally
they'd
say
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
an
unusual
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
should
make
one
thing...
i
don't
think
anybody
is
considering
overruling
sunburst
which
was
a
civil
case
and
which...
which
specifically
said
it
was
a
new
rule.
that's
not
before
us.
so,
we're
not
overruling
sunburst
no
matter
what
we
do.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr....
thank
you,
mr.
graci.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieber,
does
it
cut
in
either
direction
that
fiore
did
try
to
get
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
to
focus
on
his
case,
what,
four
times
and
every
time
they
just
denied...
they
denied
review.
does
that
count
one
way
or
another?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
hadn't
even
tried
to
put
it
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
perhaps
there
would
have
been
some
question
about
exhaustion
or
waiver,
but
he
did
try
a
number
of
times.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
suggest
a
view
of
the
pennsylvania
court
that
it
doesn't
apply
its
new
decisions
to
cases
that
have
become
final.
it
won't
apply
them
on
collateral
review
at
the
state
level.
i
mean,
that's
what
it
suggests
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
that...
that
idea
must
have
occurred
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
they
nonetheless
denied
it.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-942
fiore
against
white
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
