mr.
robert
a.
graci
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
this
case
is
procedurally
complex,
the
principles
involved
are
not.
like
coleman
v.
thompson,
it's
a
case
about
federalism.
at
its
core,
the
case
presents
one
very
basic
question:
should
habeas
relief
be
extended
to
grant
relief
to
a
state
prisoner
by
requiring
state
courts
to
apply
a
new
state
appellate
decision
interpreting
state
law
to
the
petitioner's
case
which
was
final
before
the
new
decision
was
announced?
mr.
robert
a.
graci
yes,
justice
stevens.
i
assume
that
under
the
decisional
law
of
pennsylvania
as
to
what
constitutes
a
new
decision,
the
decision
in
scarpone
was
new.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
no,
we
would
not,
your
honor,
because,
while
i
agree
with
what
my
opponent
said
with
respect
to
the
ettinger
case,
which
was
a
third
circuit
case
interpreting
pennsylvania
law
with
respect
to
the
retroactive
application
of
new
decisions
interpreting
state
statutes,
it
didn't
go
far
enough.
ettinger
relied
on
a
case
called
kuchinic.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
and
shaffer.
shaffer
was
a
case
decided
while
it
was
on
direct
appeal.
so,
the
court
had
no
reason
to
say
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
or
not
it
would
apply
retroactively.
quite
frankly,
in
the
shaffer
context,
we
have
very
serious
concerns
because
a
lot
of
cases
had
been...
there
had
been
convictions
and
guilty
pleas
based
on
the
case
that
the
shaffer
case
specifically
overruled.
but
all
the
court
said
in
shaffer
was,
as
your
honor
recognized,
justice
stevens,
in
bousley,
that
the
law
is
what
we
say
it
was
from
the
beginning,
but
then
they
say
in
kuchinic,
which
is
cited
in
ettinger...
and
the
kuchinic
cite
is
222
atlantic
2nd
897,
a
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case
from
1966.
it
says
that
the
latest
decision
is
applicable
to
a
case...
and
this
applies
even
if
they
changed,
as
one
of
the
hypotheticals
was,
where
they
said
the
statute
meant
one
thing
in
one
opinion
and
then
changed
their
mind
years
later.
they
said
in
such
circumstances,
the
latest
interpretation
is
applicable
to
a
case
whose
appeal
has
not
yet
been
decided.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
your
honor,
based
on
your
interpretation
and
your
statement
relying
on
rivers
and
the
bousley
case--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--that
would
be
correct,
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
pennsylvania,
as
i've
explained,
in
the...
in
the
kuchinic
case
said...
and
they
didn't
have
to
say
it
in
shaffer,
i'll
reiterate,
because
in
shaffer
he
was
there
on
direct
appeal.
in
kuchinic,
they
said
it
does
not
reach
back
to
final
cases.
it
only
applies
to
cases
where
the
direct
appeal
is
pending.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
well,
what
they
were
interpreting...
i
don't
think
they...
they
announced
or
said
what
the
rule
was
in
kuchinic,
but
in
shaffer
they
wouldn't
have
had
any
reason
to
say
it
because
shaffer
was
there
while
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
you're
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
they
said
that
at
least
twice.
they
said
there
was
a
conflict
between
the...
what
the
superior
court
did
in
petitioner's
case
and
what
commonwealth
court
did
in
scarpone's
case,
and
they
were
concerned
that
my
office,
the
office
of
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth,
which
brings
these
prosecutions,
wouldn't
know
how
to
work,
wouldn't
know
what
to
do.
and
that
gets
to
a
point
that
was
made
earlier,
your
honor,
as
to
the
precedential
effect
of
the
memorandum
opinion.
it
doesn't
have
broad
precedential
effect,
but
the...
the
iop
is
cited...
the
internal
operating
procedure
of
the
superior
court
to
which
counsel
references,
and
it
specifically
says
that
there's
an
exception
as
far
as
the
precedential
value
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
case
is
important
as
to
issues
of
res
judicata.
in
this
particular
case,
that
was
critically
important
because
it
went
to
the
first
issue
that
the
superior
court
and
the
trial
court
in
the
post-conviction
proceedings
discussed,
and
that
was
that
this
statutory
construction,
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
jackson
claim,
if
you
will,
had
been
decided
against
fiore
in
his
original
appeal
and
that
they
would
not
under
state
procedural
law,
under
our
post-conviction
relief
act...
would
not
allow
the
re-litigation
of
a
claim
that
had
already
been
litigated
on
direct
appeal.
that
was
one
of
the
bases
for
the
state
court's
ruling.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that's
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
as
to
why
the
federal
court
doesn't
get
to
determine
that
this...
the
constitutionality,
if
you
will,
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
in...
not
entirely,
justice
souter.
you
are
correct...
and
justice
ginsburg
had
indicated
earlier...
that
they
used
that
phrase,
bald
fiction.
the
reason
this
is
a
new
decision,
however,
for
pennsylvania
law
isn't
because
it
overruled
a
prior
decision,
which
would
be
a
law-changing
under
your
hypothetical
or
under
your
set
of
facts.
that's
one
way
that
a
new
decision
is
announced,
by
overruling
prior
precedent.
if
this
court,
even
if
it
reaches
the
limited
holding
that
your
honor
suggested
earlier,
that
would
be
overruling
a
part
of
what
sunburst
said
because
sunburst
didn't
draw
any
distinction
between
the
kinds
of
claims
and
what
the
states
had
to
do
with
their
own
new
decisions.
but
pennsylvania,
when
it
adopted
its
own
rule
of
retroactivity
and
it
cited
the
cases
of
this
court
which
said
that
the
constitution
has
no
voice
on
this
subject,
starting
with...
with
sunburst,
and
they
adopted,
however,
this
court's
test
set
forth
in
chevron
oil
v.
huson
that
said
that
you
can
have
a
new
decision
not
only
by
overruling
clear
past
precedent,
but
by
deciding
an
issue
of
first
impression,
the
answer
to
which
was
not
clearly
foreshadowed.
and
even
though
the--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i
guess,
as
i--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i
believe
the
answer,
justice
souter,
is
no.
i'm
sorry.
is
yes.
that's
the
way--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--well,
i
guess
if
we
have
to
use
your
words,
it's
a
changing
decision
because
you
say
it
is,
but
it's
a
new
decision
under
pennsylvania's
law.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
well,
it's
new
because
it
was
a...
a...
in
the
state
supreme
court,
an
issue
of
first
impression,
the
answer
to
which
was
not
clearly
foreseeable.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
not--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
assumption.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
if
there
was
nothing
that
had
gone
before,
so
that
by
announcing
that
whoever
made
a
decision,
it
could
be
questioned,
but
in
this
case...
then
i
could
agree
with
your
premise.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
i...
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
it
may
be
a
fair
reading,
but
not
necessarily
the
only
reading.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
not
of
which
i'm
aware,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
well...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
your
honor
off.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
i--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i
think
it
would
have
been
a
decision
establishing
the
law
by
the
highest
jurisdiction
of
the
commonwealth
in
that
instance.
i
would...
as
i
stand
before
the
court,
i
wish
perhaps--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--no.
and
it
would
depend
on
what
the
context
is.
this
question
only
gets
asked
when
you
have
somebody
in
petitioner's
circumstance
and
somebody
who
got
relief.
the...
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
law-changing,
again
we
have
to
look
to
the
determination
of
the
state
courts
as
to
what
constitutes
a
new
rule
for
its--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--own
retroactivity
purposes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
well,
i
think
the...
the
case
that
i
mentioned
earlier--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--the
kuchinic,
which
i've
given
the
cite,
blackwell,
where
they--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--which
is
cited
in--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--blackwell,
which
is
cited--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--kuchinic,
k-u-c-h--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i-n-i-c.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
222
atlantic
2nd
897.
blackwell
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief.
excuse
me.
the
language
that
the
court
chose
in
using
bald
fiction
i
don't
think
should
be
a
troublesome
matter,
any
more
than
when
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
its
teague
cases
that,
well,
such
and
such
is
controlling
or
such
and
such
is
controlled
by.
but
then
when
you
have
to
truly
analyze
it
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rule
that
is
being
sought
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--you
say
controlling--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
that
is
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
know,
however...
and
the
record
doesn't
support...
that
we
could
have
sustained
a
conviction
on
that
charge
because,
as
i
understand
it,
it
requires
a
proof
of
pollution
which
requires
not
simply
discharge
of
hazardous
waste...
and
there
were
these
organic
chemicals
that
were
being
thrown
into
the
tributary
of
the
youghiogheny
river...
but
it
also
requires
some
particular
level.
and
while
we
had
proof
that
it
was
being
done,
we
didn't
have
proof
of
the
level.
so,
i
don't
know
that
we
could
have
proven
pollution.
and,
therefore,
i
don't
think
we
could
have
proven
the
first
degree
felony.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
it's
my
recollection,
justice
scalia,
that
they've
recently
adopted
one.
i
don't
believe
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
going
through
either
the
state
or
the
federal
courts.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--but
we
don't
apply
our
rules
back
to
final
cases.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
okay,
that's
not
pennsylvania's
rule,
as
i
understand
it.
but
i
think
that
should
be--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
jurisprudence--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--what
should
happen
under
pennsylvania
law,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
within
teague's
first
exception.
it
would
be
a
rule
of
substance
where
you
say
the
constitution
just
prohibits
getting
into
that
conduct
the
way
that
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
interracial
marriage
or--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--if
the
conviction...
if
the
court's
ruling,
justice
kennedy,
was
that
that
type
of
private
primary
conduct
is
removed
from
the
criminal
law
making
authority
to
proscribe,
which
is
the
first
exception
to
teague,
then
the
state
courts
under
harper
v.
virginia
department
of
taxation
would
be
required
to
follow
this
court's
rule
and
would
be
required,
since
it
would
be
within
teague's
first
exception,
to
apply
that
constitutional
decision.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
because
this...
the
rule
in
scarpone
is
not
a
rule
that
removes
private
primary
conduct
from
the
criminal
law
making
authority
of
the
states
to
proscribe.
it
is
not
of
the
ilk
that
you
just
described,
your
honor,
where
there
is
certain
activity
that
can
never
be
punished.
it's
clear
that
the
activity
that
fiore
engaged
in
could
have
been
punished.
the...
the...
what
happened
here
is
the
supreme
court,
after
his
conviction
was
final,
said
they
shouldn't
have
punished
him
under
this
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
as
to
him,
the
only
difference
is
the
rules
of
finality
that
this
court
has
embraced
in
adopting
its...
its
habeas
jurisprudence.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
i
believe
the
law
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
is
that,
as
to
the
conviction
that
was
final
on
appeal...
when
you
say
it
was
never
criminal,
in
fiore's
case...
and
this
is
where
i
have
to
beg
to
differ
with
the
court,
it
was
criminal
because--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--the
difference
is
the
first
case
is
conduct
that
the
constitution
has
always
prohibited
from
being
made
criminal.
in
the
second
case,
it's
nothing
more
than
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
this
court
has
drawn
the
line
in
applying
the
teague
exception,
the
first
teague
exception,
to
those
cases
where
the
constitution
prohibits
the
criminalization
of
certain
conduct.
i
have
to
concede
that
in
bousley
this
court,
in
interpreting
a
2255
case,
a
petition
brought
by
a
federal
prisoner,
said
that
when
you
interpret
a
federal
law
that
says
that
the
law
means
this
and
that
it
has
always
meant
that,
that
the
court
said
that
that
was
like
teague's
first
exception.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
wasn't
necessary
to
the
court's
resolution
of
the
case,
but
it
didn't
say
that
it
was
teague's
first
exception.
and
that
gets
back
to
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--well,
it
would
only
be
a
difference
under
state
law
if
this
court,
as
the
final
arbiter
of
what
the
constitution
says,
says
that
in
the
one
instance
it
could
never
be...
it
could
never
be
prosecuted.
it
could
never
be
made
criminal.
that's
the
line
that
this
court
has
drawn
in
expositing
the
teague's
first
exception.
to
extend
that...
and
i
submit
that
it
would
be...
and
that's
the...
the
language
that...
that
fiore
uses
in
his...
in
his
petition,
to
extend
habeas
to
include
something
that's
like
the
teague
first
exception
but
is
not
really
the
teague
first
exception
as
a
matter
of
policy
shouldn't
be
the
case.
habeas
is
designed,
as
this
court
has
regularly
said,
to
overcome
fundamental
miscarriages
of
justice.
well,
let's
look
at
what
happened
to
fiore
and
see
what
was
fundamentally
flawed
with
his
conviction.
he
was
tried.
a
charge
was
brought.
he
lodged
an
objection
to
it
and
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
me.
the
state
court...
and
there's
always
going
to
be
a
first
case.
the
state
court
said,
yes,
it
does
apply
to
you.
this
is
how
i
construe
it.
you
are
a
person
in
a
heavily
regulated
industry.
you
had...
you
went
through
the
permitting
process.
you
should
know
that
what
you
weren't
permitted
to
do
wasn't
permitted.
and
that's
how
he
interpreted
the
statute.
and
the
state
superior
court,
a
court
of
equal
jurisdiction
with
the
commonwealth
court,
a
court
of
statewide
jurisdiction,
said,
i
agree.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
your
question,
justice
stevens,
is
in
two
parts.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
obviously,
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
yes,
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
now
said,
as
the
final
arbiter
of
pennsylvania's
law,
that
this
statute
is
in
two
parts,
and
if
you
have
a
permit,
you
can't
be
convicted
of
it.
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
was
a
change
in
the
law
for
state
new
law
principles--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--yes,
if,
as
in
this
case,
he
significantly
departed
from
the
specific
terms.
and
our
brief
sets
forth
in
some
detail,
and
purposely
so,
what
he
did
to
demonstrate
how
he
violated
the
terms
of
the
permit
which
were
so
significant
that
it
constituted
acting
without
a
permit.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
was
the
situation
faced
by
this
court
in
harper
v.
virginia
department
of
taxation,
and
the
court
said,
when
we
announce
a
rule...
and
that
case
is
particularly
important,
because
you
said,
when
we
announce
a
rule
and
give
a
remedy
to
the
party
before
the
court,
every
lower
court,
state
or
federal,
has
to
follow
our
rule.
but
the
court
was
clear
to
say
that
whatever
sunburst
oil
says,
we're
not
interfering
with.
the
states
are
free,
when
they're
interpreting
questions
of
state
law,
to
continue
to
determine
for
themselves
whether
or
not
to
apply
a
law
or
a
change
in
the
law
retroactively
or
prospectively
or
partially
retroactively.
mr.
robert
a.
graci
it
would
be
a
fragile
constitutional
protection
if
the
state
courts
could
do
that.
under...
i'm
sorry.
under
harper,
they
can't
and
the
cases
that
precede
harper
where
the
issue
is
one
of
state
law
and
interpretation
of
state
law,
this
court
has
regularly
said
that
the
constitution
has
no
voice
on
the
subject
of
retroactivity.
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
cited
to
this
court's
opinions
in
that
regard
and...
and
clearly
believe
that
they
are
talking
about
state
law
when
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
apply
a
new
decision
retroactively
or
prospectively.
in
this
particular
case,
it's
clear
that
the
trial
judge
on
the
post-conviction
proceeding
thought
that
he
was
following
settled
pennsylvania
law
that
he
could
not
apply
the
new
rule
announced
in
scarpone
to
mr.
fiore.
the
superior
court
said
the
same
thing.
that's
the
best
indicator
i
can
find--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i
think
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
point
to
a
specific
case
other
than--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--the...
well,
shaffer,
or
shaffer--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--well,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--what
i
have
found--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
your
honor
off.
what
i
have
found
in
pennsylvania's
cases,
similar
to
the
cases
in
this
court
both
before
and
after
teague,
is
they
don't
really
say
whether
a
new
rule
will
be
prospective
or
retroactive
until
somebody
asks
the
court
to
say
so.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
in
shaffer,
that
shaffer
was
on
direct
review.
we
have
a
problem
with
shaffer
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that...
i
don't
mean
a
problem
before
this
court,
but
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
case
is
so
important,
because
if
this
court
announces
a
new
rule
and
overrules
sunburst,
then
the
situation
in
shaffer
where
our
court,
after
12
years
of
following
an
interpretation
of
the
superior
court
where
a
lot
of
people
went
to
jail
both
on
guilty
pleas
and
jury
trials
for
having
violated
our
racketeering
statute--
mr.
robert
a.
graci
--i
see
my
red
light
is
on.
may
i
respond?
mr.
robert
a.
graci
thank
you,
your
honor.
