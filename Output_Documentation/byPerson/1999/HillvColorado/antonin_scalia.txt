justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
filed
a
dissent
in
this
case
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
it
has
long
been
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence
that
government
imposed
restrictions
on
speech
must
be
narrowly
tailored.
they
cannot
go
further
than
it
is
necessary
to
achieve
a
legitimate
state
interest
that
is
pursued.
moreover,
if
the
restriction
on
speech
is
content
based,
if
it
applies
not
impartially
to
all
speech
but
only
to
speech
with
a
particular
content
the
asserted
state
interest
must
be
not
only
a
significant
one
but
a
compelling
one.
the
court
today
concludes
that
the
compelling
state
interest
requirement
is
not
applicable
here
because
the
restriction
is
not
content
based,
that
is
patently
false.
the
ban
on
leafleting
does
indeed
apply
to
all
leaflets
of
whatever
content,
but
the
ban
on
oral
speech
applies
only
to
speech
that
consists
of
“protest,
education,
or
counseling”.
of
course,
in
the
context
of
this
legislation
applicable
only
to
healthcare
facilities,
we
all
know
that
those
terms
are
code
words
for
speech
in
opposition
to
abortion,
but
even
accepting
them
at
face
value,
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
they
do
not
make
the
restriction
hinge
upon
the
content
of
the
speech.
whether
a
speaker
may
obtain
permission
before
approaching
within
eight
feet
and
whether
he
will
be
sent
to
prison
for
failing
to
do
so,
depends
entirely
on
what
he
intends
to
say
when
he
gets
there.
even
if
however,
the
regulation
here
were
not
content
based,
it
would
under
our
well-established
law
still
have
to
be
narrowly
tailored
in
order
to
achieve
a
significant
though
not
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
plainly
does
not
pass
even
that
more
lenient
test.
the
statute
the
court
upholds
today
makes
it
a
criminal
act
knowingly
to
approach
within
eight
feet
of
another
person
without
his
consent
on
the
public
sidewalk
within
a
100
feet
of
the
entrance
door
to
a
healthcare
facility
for
the
purpose
of
passing
a
leaflet
to,
displaying
a
sign
to,
or
engaging
in
oral
protest,
education,
or
counseling
with
such
person.
the
eight
foot
buffer
zone
attaches
to
every
person
on
the
public
way
or
sidewalk
within
a
100
feet
of
the
entrance
of
a
medical
facility,
not
just
pregnant
woman,
not
just
healthcare
providers,
not
even
just
those
people
seeking
to
enter
the
facility
but
to
everyone
passing
on
the
sidewalk.
as
the
state
acknowledged
at
oral
argument
this
weird
buffer
zone
would
attach
to
any
person
within
a
100
feet
of
the
entrance
door
of
a
skyscraper
in
which
a
single
doctor,
not
necessarily
a
doctor
providing
abortion
but
even
a
dentist
occupied
an
office
on
the
18th
floor,
and
of
course
the
statute
criminalizes
all
unconsented
to
approaches,
no
matter
how
peaceful
and
non-threatening
for
the
purpose
of
oral
protest,
education,
or
counseling.
not
just
protest,
education,
or
counseling
concerning
abortion
or
even
healthcare
more
generally,
but
also
protest,
education,
or
counseling
concerning
unionization,
religious
belief,
public
referendums,
or
anything
else.
it
also
criminalizes
every
approach
made
for
the
purposes
of
leafleting
or
handbilling,
even
the
leaflet
or
handbill
is
not
aimed
at
protest,
education,
or
counseling
but
says
simply
eat
at
bubba's
barbeque.
what
possible
legitimate
state
interest
could
this
conceivably
be
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve,
that
is
a
good
question.
the
statute
itself
said
that
its
purpose
was,
“to
prevent
willful
obstruction
of
a
person’s
access
to
medical
counseling
and
treatment
in
a
healthcare
facility”,
and
that
was
the
only
state
interest
dissertate
by
counsel
for
colorado
in
their
briefs
and
oral
argument,
but
of
course
this
law
goes
wildly
beyond
what
is
necessary
for
that
purpose.
so,
the
court
ignores
today
the
purpose
specified
by
the
statute,
and
dissertate
by
its
defenders,
and
posits
instead
the
purpose
of
protecting
citizens’
rights
to
be
let
alone
from
unwanted
speech.
this
court
invented
state
interest,
was
not
only
unasserted
by
colorado,
but
it
was
positively
disclaimed
as
of
the
purpose
of
the
law.
it
was
the
opponents
of
the
law,
the
petitioners
here,
who
had
asserted
that
that
what
its
purpose
because
it
was
so
very
clear
from
our
cases
that
such
a
purpose
protecting
people
from
unwanted
speech
in
the
public
forum
would
be
unconstitutional.
to
quote
only
one
of
our
cases
on
this
point,
“the
constitution
does
not
permit
the
government
to
decide
which
types
of
otherwise
protected
speech
are
sufficiently
offensive
to
require
protection
for
the
unwilling
listener
or
viewer.”
to
be
sure
we
have
protected
the
listener
who
is
outside
the
public
form,
the
homeowner
who’s
residence
has
picketed,
and
we
protected
the
captive
listener
who
does
not
want
to
be
subjected
to
political
propaganda
on
a
public
bus
or
trolley,
but
we
have
never
even
hinted
that
a
person
walking
along
the
public
streets
could
be
protected
from
unwelcome
speech.
the
only
authority
the
court
provides
for
its
newly
discovered
right
to
be
let
alone
is
a
passage
in
justice
brandeis’
1928
dissent
in
a
case
called
olmstead
versus
united
states,
and
the
amusing
feature
of
that
is
that
even
this
slim
reed
contradicts
rather
than
supports
the
court’s
position.
the
right
to
be
let
alone
that
justice
brandeis
described
was
a
right
the
constitution
conferred,
“as
against
the
government”.
wise
to
the
extent
that
there
can
be
gleaned
from
our
cases,
even
from
our
72-year-old
dissents,
a
right
to
be
let
alone,
it
is
the
right
of
the
speaker
in
the
public
forum
to
be
free
from
government
interference
of
the
sort
colorado
has
imposed
here.
as
we
said,
just
three
terms
ago,
in
a
case
called
schenck
versus
pro-choice
network
of
western
new
york
far
from
having
a
right
to
be
let
alone
“our
own
citizens
must
tolerate
insulting,
and
even
outrageous
speech
in
order
to
provide
adequate
breathing
space
to
the
freedoms
protected
by
the
first
amendment.”
at
some
points
in
its
opinion
the
court
re-characterizes
the
right
to
be
let
alone
as
a
“right
to
be
free
from
persistence,
importunity,
following
and
dogging”.
that
is
of
course
a
more
limited
interest,
but
once
again
there
is
no
possible
way
the
statue
can
be
regarded
as
narrowly-tailored
to
protect
that
interest.
it
criminalizes
the
most
innocuous
approaches
to
educate
or
counsel,
and
requires
leafleters,
no
matter
what
subject
their
leaflet
address
is,
to
avoid
approaching
passers
by
closer
than
eight
feet
with
an
outstretched
arm.
in
the
last
analysis,
the
court
frankly
acknowledges
that
this
statute
is
not
narrowly-tailored.
it
says
“a
bright-line
prophylactic
rule
maybe
the
best
way
to
provide
protection.”
i
scarcely
know
how
to
respond
to
such
an
unabashed
repudiation
of
our
first
amendment
doctrine.
broad
prophylaxis
is
the
antithesis
of
narrow
tailoring,
which
is
what
the
first
amendment
has
until
today
required.
we
have
stated
time
and
time
again
that
prophylactic
restrictions
in
the
first
amendment
context
even
when
they
are
content-neutral
are
not
permissible.
the
court
emphasizes
in
its
opinion
the
importance
of
taking
into
account
“the
place
to
which
these
regulations
apply”
but
a
proper
regard
for
the
place
involved
in
this
case
should
result
and
if
anything,
a
commitment
by
this
court
to
adhere
even
more
rigorously
to
our
speech
protective
standards.
the
public
forum
involved
here,
the
public
space
outside
of
abortion
clinics
has
become
by
necessity
and
by
virtue
of
this
court’s
decisions,
a
forum
of
last
resort
for
those
who
oppose
abortion.
the
possibility
of
limiting
abortion
by
legislative
means
even
abortion
of
a
live-and-kicking
child
that
is
almost
entirely
out
of
the
womb
has
been
rendered
impossible
by
our
decisions
from
roe
versus
wade
to
stenberg
versus
carhart.
for
those
who
share
an
abiding
moral
or
religious
conviction
or
for
that
matter,
simply
a
biological
appreciation
that
abortion
is
the
taking
of
a
human
life,
there
is
no
option
but
to
persuade
women
one-by-one,
not
to
make
that
choice.
as
a
general
matter,
the
most
effective
place,
if
not
the
only
place,
where
that
persuasion
can
occur,
is
outside
the
entrances
to
abortion
facilities.
by
upholding
these
restrictions
on
speech
in
this
place
the
court
ratifies
the
state’s
attempt
to
make
even
that
task
an
impossible
one.
the
court
seeks
to
minimize
the
burden
that
this
law
places
upon
those
who
wish
to
speak.
it
seriously
asserts,
for
example,
that
the
eight-foot
zone
allows
a
speaker
to
communicate
at
a
“normal
conversational
distance”.
i
have
certainly
held
conversations
at
a
distance
of
eight
feet
seated
in
the
quiet
of
my
chambers,
but
i
have
never
walked
along
the
public
sidewalk
and
have
not
seen
others
do
so
conversing
at
an
eight-foot
remove,
the
suggestion
is
absurd.
so
is
the
court’s
suggestion
that
the
opponents
of
abortion
can
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
the
statute
“places
no
limitation
on
the
number
of
speakers
or
the
noise
level,
including
the
use
of
amplification
equipment”.
that
is
good
enough
i
suppose
for
those
individuals
or
groups
who
are
intent
on
bullying
or
frightening
women
out
of
an
abortion
or
doctors
out
of
performing
that
procedure.
hate
and
invective,
shouted
by
a
mob
through
bullhorns
at
a
distance
of
eight
feet
will
serve
their
purposes
well
enough,
but
those
who
would
accomplish
their
moral
and
religious
objectives
by
peaceful
and
civil
needs,
by
trying
to
persuade
individual
women
of
the
rightness
of
their
cause
will
be
deterred;
and
that
is
not
a
good
thing
for
democracy.
the
availability
of
a
powerful
amplification
system
will
be
of
little
help
to
the
woman
who
hopes
to
forge,
in
the
last
moments
before
another
of
her
sexes
to
have
an
abortion,
a
bond
of
concern
and
intimacy
that
might
enable
her
to
persuade
the
woman
to
change
her
mind
and
heart.
the
counselor
may
wish
to
walk
alongside
and
say,
sympathetically
and
as
softly
as
the
circumstances
allow
something
like:
“my
dear,
i
know
what
you
are
going
through.
i
have
been
through
it
myself.
you
are
not
alone
and
you
do
not
have
to
do
this.
there
are
other
alternatives.
will
you
let
me
help
you?
may
i
show
you
a
picture
of
what
your
child
looks
like
at
this
stage
of
her
human
development?”
the
court
would
have
us
believe
that
this
can
be
done
effectively
yea,
it
suggests,
perhaps
even
more
effectively
by
shouting
through
a
bullhorn
at
a
distance
of
eight
feet.
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
present
decision
with
the
other
abortion
case
decided
today,
the
stenberg.
this
decision
upholds
an
utterly
bizarre
proabortion,
please
may
i
approach
provision,
while
stenberg
strikes
down
a
live-birth
abortion
prohibition
adopted
by
30
states
and
twice
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress.
the
present
case
disregards
the
state’s
own
assertion
of
the
purpose
of
its
proabortion
law,
and
posits
instead
a
purpose
that
the
court
believes
will
be
more
likely
to
render
the
law
constitutional.
while
stenberg,
as
you
have
heard
rejected
the
state’s
assertion
of
the
meaning
of
its
antiabortion
law,
and
declared
instead
a
meaning
designed
to
render
the
law
unconstitutional.
the
present
case
rejects
overbreadth
challenges
to
a
proabortion
law
that
regulates
speech,
on
grounds
that
have
no
support
in
our
prior
jurisprudence
and
that
instead
amount
to
a
total
repudiation
of
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth.
while
stenberg
applies
overbreadth
analysis
to
an
antiabortion
law
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
speech,
even
though
until
eight
years
ago
overbreadth
was
unquestionably
the
exclusive
preserve
of
the
first
amendment.
does
the
deck
seem
stacked?
you
bet!
the
decision
in
the
present
case
is
not
an
isolated
distortion
of
our
traditional
constitutional
principles,
but
is
merely
the
latest
of
many
aggressively
proabortion
novelties
announced
by
the
court
in
recent
years.
today’s
distortions,
however,
are
particularly
blatant.
restrictive
views
of
the
first
amendment
that
have
been
in
dissent
in
this
court
since
the
1930s
suddenly
find
themselves
in
the
majority.
as
a
result,
our
long
standing
commitment
to
uninhibited,
robust,
and
wide-open
debate
is
miraculously
replaced
by
the
power
of
the
state
to
protect
an
unheard
of
right
to
be
let
alone
on
the
public
streets.
