justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
too
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
i
agree
with
justice
scalia’s
first
amendment
analysis.
the
court’s
holding
contradicts
more
than
half-a-century
of
well-established
first
amendment
principles,
and
for
the
first
time
the
court
approves
a
law
which
bars
a
private
citizen
from
passing
the
message
in
a
peaceful
manner
and
on
a
profound
moral
issue
to
a
fellow
citizen
on
a
public
sidewalk.
under
the
colorado
law,
the
state
must
review
content
to
determine
whether
a
person
has
engaged
in
criminal
protest,
education,
or
counseling,
the
first
amendment
does
not
give
the
government
this
power.
statute
is
content
based
for
an
additional
reason.
it
restricts
speech
on
particular
topics.
just
a
few
decades
a
state
with
a
history
of
enforcing
racial
discrimination
had
enacted
a
statute
like
this
one,
regulating
oral
protest,
education,
or
counseling
within
a
100
feet
of
the
entrance
to
any
lunch
counter,
our
predecessors
would
not
have
hesitated
to
hold
it
was
content
based
and
viewpoint
based.
it
should
be
a
profound
disappointment
to
defenders
of
the
first
amendment
that
the
court
today
refuses
to
apply
the
same
structural
analysis
when
the
speech
involved
is
less
palatable
to
it.
to
say
that
one
citizen
can
approach
another
to
ask
the
time
or
the
weather
forecast
or
the
directions
to
main
street
but
not
to
initiate
discussion
on
one
of
the
most
basic
moral
and
political
issues
in
all
of
contemporary
discourse,
a
question
touching
profound
ideas
in
philosophy
and
theology
is
an
astonishing
view
of
the
first
amendment.
after
the
court
errs
in
finding
the
statute
content
neutral,
it
compounds
the
mistake
by
finding
the
law
viewpoint
neutral.
the
purpose
and
design
of
the
statute
as
everyone
ought
to
know
and
as
its
own
defenders
urged
in
attempted
justification
are
to
restrict
speakers
on
one
side
of
debate
those
who
protest
abortions.
the
anti-speech
distinction
pertains
if
a
citizen
approaches
a
public
official
who
is
visiting
a
healthcare
facility
to
make
a
point
in
favor
of
abortion
rights.
if
she
says,
“good
job
governor!”
there
is
no
violation;
if
she
says,
“shame
on
you
governor!”
there
is.
thus
does
the
court
today
ensure
its
own
decisions
can
be
praised
but
not
condemned.
thus
does
it
restrict
speech
designed
to
teach
that
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
is
not
necessarily
concomitant
with
making
a
sound
moral
decision.
nothing
in
our
law
or
our
enviable
free
speech
jurisprudence
sustains
this
rule.
in
a
further
departure
from
precedent,
as
justice
scalia
has
indicated
we
learned
today
that
citizens
have
a
right
to
avoid
unpopular
speech
in
a
public
forum.
the
constitution
does
not
permit
a
state
to
make
criminal
the
peaceful
expression
of
unpopular
views.
the
colorado
statute
offends
settled
first
amendment
principles
in
another
fundamental
respect.
it
violates
the
constitutional
prohibitions
against
vague
or
overly
broad
criminal
statutes
regulating
speech.
this
law
is
more
vague
and
overly
broad
than
any
criminal
statute
the
court
has
ever
sustained
as
a
permissible
regulation
of
speech.
now,
even
aside
from
the
erroneous
and
most
disturbing
assumptions
that
the
statute
is
content
neutral
and
viewpoint
neutral,
neither
vague
nor
overbroad,
the
court
falls
in
the
further
serious
error
when
it
turns
at
the
time,
place,
and
manner
rules
set
forth
in
ward.
as
justice
scalia
has
indicated
both
the
state
and
the
court
attempt
to
sidestep
the
enactment’s
obvious
content-based
restriction
by
praising
the
statute’s
breadth,
by
telling
us
all
topics
of
conversation,
not
just
discourse
on
abortion,
or
within
the
statutory
proscription
against
protest,
education,
and
counseling.
the
saving
feature
the
court
tries
to
grasp
simply
creates
additional
free
speech
infirmity.
the
law
does
not
permit
content
censoring
to
be
cured
by
taking
even
more
protected
speech
within
the
statute’s
reach.
in
an
age
when
vast
resources
and
talents
are
commanded
by
a
sophisticated
media
to
shape
opinions
on
limitless
subjects
and
ideas,
the
distribution
of
leaflets
on
a
sidewalk
may
seem
a
bit
antiquated.
this
case
proves
the
necessity
for
that
traditional
mode
of
speech.
colorado’s
excuse
and
the
court’s
excuse
for
the
serious
burden
imposed
upon
the
right
to
leaflet
or
to
discuss
is
that
it
occurs
at
the
wrong
place.
again,
colorado
and
the
court
have
it
just
backwards.
for
these
protestors
the
100-foot
zone
in
which
a
young
woman
seeks
to
enter
a
building
is
not
just
the
last
place
where
the
message
can
be
communicated,
it
is
likely
the
only
place.
it
is
the
location
where
the
court
should
expend
its
utmost
effort
to
vindicate
free
speech,
not
to
suppress
it.
in
planned
parenthood
versus
casey,
we
reaffirmed
our
prior
holding
that
the
constitution
protects
a
woman’s
right
to
terminate
her
pregnancy
in
its
early
stages.
our
decision
took
care
to
recognize
the
gravity
in
lasting
consequence
of
the
personal
decision
at
stake.
the
court
now
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
reasoned,
careful
balance
i
had
thought
was
the
basis
for
the
joint
opinion
in
casey.
the
vital
principle
of
that
opinion
was
that
in
defined
instances
the
woman’s
decision
whether
to
abort
her
child
was
in
its
essence
a
moral
one.
foreclosed
from
using
the
machinery
of
government
to
ban
abortions
in
early
term,
those
who
oppose
it
are
remitted
to
debate
the
issue
in
its
moral
dimensions.
in
a
cruel
way,
the
court
today
turns
its
back
on
that
balance.
it
in
effect
tells
us
the
moral
debate
is
not
so
important
after
all
and
can
be
conducted
just
as
well
through
a
bullhorn
from
an
eight-foot
distance
as
it
can
through
a
peaceful,
face-to-face
exchange
of
a
leaflet.
there
runs
through
our
first
amendment
theory,
a
concept
of
immediacy,
the
idea
that
thoughts
and
pleas
and
petitions
must
not
be
lost
with
the
passage
of
time.
in
the
fleeting
existence
we
have
but
little
time
to
find
truth
through
discourse.
no
better
illustration
of
the
immediacy
of
speech,
of
the
urgency
of
persuasion,
of
the
preciousness
of
time
is
presented
than
in
this
case.
here
the
citizens
who
claim
first
amendment
protection
seek
it
for
speech
which,
if
it
is
to
be
effective,
must
take
place
at
the
very
time
and
place
a
grievous
moral
wrong,
in
their
view
is
about
to
occur.
the
court
tears
away
from
the
protesters
the
guarantees
of
the
first
amendment
when
they
most
need
it.
so
committed
is
the
court
to
its
course
that
it
denies
these
protesters,
in
the
face
of
what
they
consider
to
be
one
of
life’s
gravest
moral
crises,
even
the
opportunity
to
try
to
offer
a
fellow
citizen
a
little
pamphlet,
a
handheld
paper
seeking
to
reach
a
higher
law.
