mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
colorado
statute
at
issue
here,
18-9-122,
section
3,
converts
protected
speech
into
a
crime.
the
statute,
which
can
be
found
at
page
64a
and
65a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
last
two
pages,
imposes
an
8-foot
floating
bubble
zone
around
every
person
who
passes
within
a
100-foot
radius
of
every
entrance
door
to
every
health
care
facility
in
the
state
of
colorado.
within
that
floating
bubble
zone,
the
statute
criminalizes
a
knowing
approach
made
for
the
purposes
of
engaging
in
constitutionally
protected
speech
unless
prior
consent
is
obtained.
the
consent
provision
alone
invalidates
the
statute.
it
makes
the
peaceful
distribution
of
a
leaflet,
the
display
of
a
sign,
and
even
specific
oral
communications
in
a
traditional
public
forum
a
crime
if
prior
consent
is
not
obtained.
the
statute
targets
only
constitutionally
protected
speech.
there
is
no
core
or
prescribable
conduct
which
this
statute
reaches.
the
bubble
zone,
with
its
consent
provisions,
attaches
to
every
person
who
comes
within
a
100-foot
radius
of
every
health
care
facility
in
the
state.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
outside
of
the
zone,
there
is
no
restriction
on
speech.
it's
when
you--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
but
there...
you
have...
there
are
two
different
zones
here.
the
8-foot
bubble
zone
comes
into
existence
when
someone
is
within
a
100-foot
area...
radius
of
a
health
care
facility.
the
bubble
zone
which
floats
attaches
to
every
person
who
enters
that
specific...
specific
zone.
so,
you...
once
you're
within
the
8-foot
of
someone,
if
you
do
not
ask
for
consent,
you
do
not...
you're
not
allowed
to
speak.
it's
a--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
it's--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
the
same
issues
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
schenck,
the
distribution--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
i...
i
think
there
is,
justice
breyer.
i
think
the...
the
bubble
zone
floats.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
it
attaches
to
everyone
who
is
within...
comes
within
the
initial
100-foot
area.
that
bubble
zone
floats
to...
unless
you--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--this--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
that's
incorrect,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
here's
the
reason
why.
the
zone
here
does
float.
you
are
not
allowed
to
enter
that
8-foot
zone
unless
there
is
prior
consent.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
correct.
if
you're
standing
still
and
you're
there
first.
in...
in
that
regard,
it
operates...
the
consent
provision
here
operates
exactly
as
the
consent
provision
in
madsen.
in
madsen,
you
could
stand
still.
if
you
weren't
there
first,
you
could
stand
still.
it
prohibited
a
physical
approach,
which
is
exactly
what
this
statute
does
here.
this
statute
actually
combines
the
floating
zone
of
schenck
with
the
no-approach
zone
that
the
court
prohibited
in
madsen.
so,
if
you're
going
to
enter
within
8-feet
of
a
person,
if
you're
not
there
first...
in
other
words,
if
you
stand
still,
sure,
you
don't
violate
it,
just
like
in
madsen.
but
the
consent
provision
alone
in
madsen
invalidates
the
statute.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
actually,
justice
stevens,
in
madsen
the...
the
prohibition
that
was
at
issue
in
the
injunction
prohibited
a
physical
approach.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
not
in
madsen.
in
schenck
that
was
the
concern
of
the
floating
bubble
zone.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
in
that...
in
that
regard,
here
the
concern
was
that
the
zone
floats
in
schenck.
it
does
here.
i
mean,
while
the
person
moves,
you
have
to
move
with
them
unless
you
have
consent.
so,
justice
breyer,
it's
the
same.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
display
of
a
leaflet,
the
showing
someone
written
material.
in...
in
schenck
we
talked
about,
justice
breyer...
we
talked
about
the
displaying
of
a
bible.
in
schenck,
this
court
at
page
377
stated...
and
i'll...
i'll
quote
it
exactly...
that
the
concern
of
the
floating
bubble
zone
was
that
it
prevented
defendants,
except
for
two
sidewalk
counselors,
while
they
are
tolerated
within
the
targeted
zone,
from
communicating
a
message
from
a
normal
conversational
distance
or
handing
a
leaflet
to
people
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
correct.
it
was
15
feet
there.
i
don't
think
the
difference
between
15
feet
and
8
feet
would
make
the
constitutionality
any
different.
the
standard
is
still
the
same.
you
cannot
display
or
hand
out
a
leaflet,
say,
to
someone
8
feet
away
without,
again,
asking
for
consent.
it
was
in
schenck
this
court
said
that
the
leafleting
and
commenting
on
matters
of
public
concern
are
protected
speech,
especially
on
traditional
public
forum.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
interestingly
in
this
particular
case,
the
statute
does
prohibit
impeding,
blocking,
or
crowding,
section
2,
which
is
not
challenged.
and
i
don't
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's
simply
the
location
being
2
feet.
you
could
be
2
feet
next
to
someone,
as
i
am
with
co-counsel,
and...
and
not
cause
any
impeding.
you
could
be
1...
about
5
feet
in
front
of
somebody
and
block
them.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
just
distance.
it's
location
as
well,
and...
and
this
is
distribution
of
literature.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
it
comes
to
public
debate,
that
it
can
be
robust.
i
think
if
someone
is
2
inches
away
from
somebody
and
they're
blocking
access,
they
should
be
violating
section
2.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
don't...
first...
first
of
all,
this
would
not...
that
action
would
not
violate
the
statute
because
this
statute,
section
3,
does
not
prohibit
simply
an
approach.
it
is
an
approach
with
speech,
and
it's
the
speech
that
is
the
violation.
the
way
the
statute
works...
and
again,
it's
on
page
64a
and
65a
of
the
petition
appendix
in
its
entirety...
it
states
that
no
person
shall
knowingly
approach
another
person
within
8
feet
for
the
purpose...
unless
there's
consent,
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
a
leaflet,
displaying
signs,
handing
out
a
leaflet,
or
for
engaging
in
specific
oral
communications,
oral
protest,
education--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i...
i
think
it
suffers
from
the
same
constitutional
problem.
i...
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
it's
simply
the
location
because
you
could
be
6
inches
away
from
someone
and
not
be
blocking
them
at
all.
you
could
be
3
feet
and
block
somebody.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
justice
scalia,
i...
i
wouldn't
even
want
to
give
you
the
eighth
of
the
inch.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so
because
this
is...
this
is
speech
on
a
public
forum,
and
if
you're
blocking
somebody,
that...
that's
a
different
story.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i...
i
think
leafleting,
mr.
chief
justice,
does
require
close
contact.
when
someone
distributes
a
leaflet,
usually
it's
with
a
hand
extended
which
if
you
were,
by
the
way,
8
feet
away
from
this
particular
person
you
were
approaching,
you'd
violate
that
bubble
with...
with--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
and
i...
i
take
it,
when
it
landed
on
the
streets,
it
would
be...
have
been
protected
speech
at
that
point.
[laughter]
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
that
the
danger
in
that
is,
because
it's
so
specific
on
facts
and
circumstances,
in
the
context
of
a
statute
like
this,
that
if
the
concern
that's
being
addressed
is
access
or
blocking,
the
way
to
handle
it...
the
state
of
colorado
did
it...
and
that
is
section
2.
a
person
commits
a
class
3
misdemeanor.
it's
the
same
offense.
7
months
in
jail.
if
you
obstruct,
detain,
hinder,
or
impede.
i
would
take
it
if
you're
an
eighth
away--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no.
it
probably
would
be
an
assault
at
that
point.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
under
the
statute--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--because
of
speech
activity.
this...
and
interestingly,
under
your
example,
if
you
came
up
to
someone
or
a
protestor
came
up
to
someone
and
engaged
in
very
intimidating
facial
expressions
and
made
very
intimidating
gestures,
they
don't
violate
this
statute,
but
the
petitioner
here,
jeannie
hill,
if
she
goes
and
approaches
someone
to
hand
them
a
leaflet
or
to
engage
in
quiet
conversation,
a
counseling,
she
violates
the
statute.
so,
the
intimidating
conduct
does
not
violate
the
statute.
the
petitioner
handing
out
a
leaflet--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
i...
i
think,
justice--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no.
they
have
absolutely...
they
do
not
have
an
obligation
to
accept
it.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
i
think
what...
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
what
you
wrote
in
kokinda...
and
that
is
people
that
live
in
metropolitan
areas
know
that
one
need
not
ponder
the
contents
of
a
leaflet
to
mechanically
take
it
out
of
someone's
hand
or,
for
that
matter,
to
reject
it,
but
it's
that
mechanical
taking
out
of
someone's
hand.
traditional
leafleting
on
public
sidewalks,
is
the
kind
of
situation
where
someone
is
out
there
approaching
people.
people
will
come
up
and
take
it.
8
feet
away
is
the
same
prohibition
as
a
restriction
on
speech.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
the
same--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
it...
the
same
argument
could
have
been
and
was
made
in
schenck,
and
this
court
said
there
15
feet
was
still
a
problem
because
the
zone
floats.
and
it
does,
justice
breyer--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
you're
standing
still
and
you're
in...
within
that
8-foot
zone
before
someone
else
is,
you--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--approaches
you?
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
it's...
that's
correct.
that's
not
a
problem.
it's
exactly
the
situation--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
you're
there
first.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
if
you're
there
first.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
absolutely.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that
operates
exactly,
justice
souter,
as
the
no-approach
zone
in
madsen.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
problem
is
the
assumption,
justice
breyer,
that
you're
operating
under
is
that
you
got
there
first,
and
if
you
got
there
first,
you...
and
you
stand
still
and
someone
approaches
you
and
you're
not
blocking
them...
of
course,
the...
the
dichotomy
of
all
this
is,
if
you're
standing
still,
you
may
well
be
blocking.
generally
protest
activities,
distribution
of
literature,
speech,
in
the
robust
debate,
people
are
moving,
but
if
you're
standing
still
and
you're
there
first,
it's
not
a
violation.
but
in
madsen,
this
court
dealt
with
exactly
the
same
situation.
it
was
a
no-approach
zone,
no
physical
approaches.
if
you
were
there
first,
if
you
were
standing
still,
it
wasn't
a
violation.
and
the
court
in
madsen
said
that
the
consent
provision
alone
invalidated
the
provision
of
the
injunction
in
madsen.
the
same
should
apply
here,
especially
since
you
have
the
combination
of
the
floating
zone
in
schenck.
it
does
float.
if
you're
not
there
first,
justice
breyer,
it
does
float
and
it
floats.
you
have
to
stay
unless
you
have
obtained
consent.
you
have
to
maintain
that
8-foot
distance.
and
i
think
showing
someone
a
bible
verse,
the
display
of
a
sign,
all
of
that
type
of
activity
which
is
more
intimate
in
its
communication--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
right,
if
they
got
there
before
the
event
opened.
but
this
statute,
which
is
not
limited
to
abortion
facilities,
which
has
the
floating
bubble
zone,
applies
to
everyone
in
that
100-foot
zone.
it's
not
just--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
to
anyone
who
doesn't
want
the
leaflet.
it's
not
limited
to
people--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--seeking
access
to
or
egress
from
the
clinic.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
you
don't
have
the...
you...
you
can't
require
someone
to
take
a
leaflet,
but
i
think
heffron
is
a
good
example
of
this.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
if
there's...
consent
is
given,
there's
no
violation
of
the
statute.
it's
the
requirement
of
consent,
we
think,
which
caused
the
problem.
in
heffron,
which
was
interesting,
of
course,
the
court
said
it
was
not
a
traditional
public
forum.
the
sidewalks
in
front
of
these
medical
health
care
facilities,
which
could
even
be
an
ophthalmologist's
office,
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
has
a
provision
in
there
that...
it's
very
specific.
if
you
enter
that
8-foot
zone,
you
have
to
obtain
consent.
in
heffron,
the
court
found
it
not
to
be
a
traditional
public
forum
and
said
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--it's...
it's
not
simply
leafleting.
i
think
it's
the...
also
the
oral
communication.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
the...
the
way
the
leafleting
works
is
usually,
in
a...
in
a
leafleting
situation,
people
are
close,
closer
than
8
feet.
they're
not
asking
may
i...
you
know,
this
statute
turns
every
literature
distribution
into
a
solicitation
because
you
have
to
ask
consent
before
you
approach.
and
interestingly,
in
heffron
the
court
stated
that,
while
finding
it
not
to
be
a
public
forum,
that
in
fact
they
did
allow
one-on-one,
face-to-face
communications
to
go
on
throughout
the
state
fair
without
any
restrictions.
that's
absolutely--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
in
this
context.
number
one,
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
content-based
prohibition
on
speech.
so,
it
would
be
a
higher
standard
than
the
madsen
standard.
it
would
be
strict
scrutiny
because
of
the
specific
limitations
on
oral
communications
that
constitute
protest,
education,
or
counsel.
and
also
this
court
in
madsen--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--absolutely.
the
prohibition
here
as...
specifically
on
its...
the
face
of
the
statute,
section
3,
requires
consent
if
you're
going
to
engage
in
specific
oral
communication:
protest,
education,
or
counsel.
a
prosecutor
who's
bringing
a
criminal
accusation
for
a
violation
of
section
3
would
have
to
establish
through
the
presentation
of
evidence
what
exactly
was
said
to
determine
if,
in
fact,
it
constitutes
protest,
education,
or
counsel.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that...
that's
interesting.
we...
we
have
thought
about
that,
and
if
it
constitutes
a
form
of
protest,
education,
or
counsel,
it
would.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
encouragement?
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
oh,
it...
i
think
that
that
would
not,
but
i
think
the
state,
if
they
were
making
an
accusation,
would
probably
say...
they
would
argue
that
it
may
constitute
a
form
a
counseling,
offering
of
guidance,
the
way
they...
they've
drafted
this.
but
what
is
interesting
here
in
that
exact
type
of
scenario,
if
a
news
reporter...
say
there
was
a
protest
going
on
at
a
particular
health
care
facility,
and
a
news
reporter
entered
the
100-foot
radius
and
then
was
going
to
approach
someone,
did
not
ask
for
consent,
and
asked
a
general
question.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
how
do
you
feel?
what
do
you
think
about
health
care
in
america
today?
probably
not
counsel,
education,
or
protest.
if
that
same
news
reporter
were
to
approach
a
person
again
without
consent
and
say
something
like
congress
was
considering
changes
to
the
health
care
laws
in
the
united
states
allowing
for
private
lawsuits
against
hmo
carriers.
what
do
you
think?
that's
education
and
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
which
i
think
they
did
not.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and...
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
so.
the
state
has
argued
that
they're
in
the
proverbial
catch
22.
they've
drafted
a
statute
that
we
argue
is
overbroad
and
one
that
is
content-based.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i...
i
think
looking
at
it,
no
because
the
most
realistic
narrow
tailoring
case
that
fits
this
the
court
found
it
to
be
content-neutral,
which
was
united
states
v.
grace.
there's
never
been
a
statute,
though,
written
like
this.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
that's...
that's
a
correct
position.
that's
the
position
we're
asserting.
and
the
reason,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that's
our
position
is
that
this
is
speech
on
a
public
sidewalk,
and
it
does
apply.
it's
a
statute.
and
i
think
the
difficulty
is...
and
far
be
it
for
me
to
draft
colorado's
statute--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
the
way
colorado
has
drafted
it,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
commercial
speech
would--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--although
it
does
bring
up
an
interesting
scenario
here,
justice
breyer,
and
that
is
the
way
that
this
statute
works...
let's
say
someone
talking
about
advertising,
to
take
your
example.
if
someone
was
handing
out
discount
pizza
coupons
on
a
public
sidewalk
in
front...
front
of
denver
general
hospital
and
failed
to
ask
for
consent
before
they
approached
someone
to
distribute
them
the
free
discount
coupon,
they
violate
this
statute.
that's
how
broad
the
statute
is
written.
it
prohibits--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no,
i
think
the
state
can.
and...
and,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--what
i
would...
what
i
would
have
drafted
if
i
was
the...
the
state
here--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
but
i'm
not.
[laughter]
is
a
statute
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes.
and
in
the...
in
the...
in
this
particular
case,
the
state's
concerns,
the
asserted
interests
here
are
to
prevent
intimidation,
crowding,
and
threatening
conduct.
this
statute
does
not
do
that.
they
need
to
draft
a
statute
that
targets
the
precise
concerns--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--section
2.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
that's--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
that...
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--because
section
2
would
satisfy
my
test,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
what
they've
done
here.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
don't
think
so,
and
let
me
clarify
my
position
and
the
reason
why.
i
don't
think
so
because
in
madsen
and
in
schenck,
despite
the
somewhat
more
rigorous
standard
that
was
given
there...
in
madsen
and
in
schenck,
the
concern
over
leafleting
and
uninvited
approaches,
even
if
they're
peaceful
being
prohibited...
the
madsen
concern...
the
schenck
concern
about
literature
distribution,
both
of
those
cases
dealt
with...
the
court
relied
on
boos
v.
barry
in...
in
madsen
and
boos
v.
barry
and
united
states
v.
grace
in
schenck...
were
both
statutory
cases.
those
were
not
injunction
cases,
and
it
was
the
concern
of
literature
distribution
and...
and
one-on-one
advocacy
that
was
the
concern.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
this
court--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
ginsburg,
the...
this
court
in
madsen
and
schenck,
in
dealing
with
the
issues,
said
that
the
injunctions
were
content-neutral
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
that's...
based
on
your
question
and...
and
comment,
justice
o'connor,
they
need
to
draft
a
statute
that
prohibits
intimidation,
crowding,
or
violence
which
i
think...
or
threatening
conduct,
which
i
think
they
did
in
section
2.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
this
isn't--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
they
set
the
purpose
out
of
the
statute
in
section
1,
which
states
that
the
general
assembly
recognizes
access
to
health
care
facilities
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
medical
counsel
and
treatment
that's
imperative
for
citizens,
that
the
exercise
of
a
person's
right
to
protest
or
counsel
against
certain
medical
procedures
must
be
balanced
against
another
person's
right
to
obtain
medical
counseling.
to
me
that
points
very
closely
to
content-based--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
pizza
solicitation
would
be
the
distribution
of
literature
prohibition
which
applies
to
all
literature
distribution.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
we...
we
think
it's
content-based
from
the
standpoint
that
it
provides
an
opportunity
for...
because
of
the
prior
consent
requirement,
to
allow
for
content-based
determinations.
but
the
distribution
of
literature
prohibition
is
because
of
the
prohibition
of
literature.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
free
access
to
clinic
entrances
act,
justice
o'connor,
it
specifically
exempts
first
amendment
activities.
with
regard
to
reliance
on
united
states
v.
grace,
on
page
176
of
this
court's
opinion...
i'm
quoting...
we
also
accept
the
government's
contention
not
contested
by
appellees
about
the
content
of
the
speech.
we
are
contesting
that
here.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
you
often
see
signs
even
that
say
quiet
zones.
i
think
the
difference
is
here
a
silent
approach
without
any
words
to
distribute
a
leaflet
requires
consent.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
it's
not
a
quiet
zone
here
that
they're
talking
about.
there's
nothing...
no
prohibition
here
that
says
you
can't
talk
loud.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
justice
breyer,
this
case...
this
particular
statute
is
a
criminal
statute.
it
requires
precision
of
regulation.
an
8-foot
prohibition
here
requiring
consent
we
believe
violates
the
first
amendment.
there
is
not
a
first
amendment
health
care
exception.
i
am
sure--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
for
the
exact
same
reason
that
this
court
in
madsen
and
in
schenck
rejected
the
health
care
exception
to
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
points
to
the
situation
in
naacp
v.
clayborne
hardware.
i'm
sure
the...
the
gentleman
that
ran
clayborne
hardware
would
have
rather
not
had
those
protestors
out
in
front
of
his
stores.
and
maybe
he
had
a
heart
condition,
and
if
he
did,
i
don't
think
you
can
carry
a
sign
that
says
i've
got
a
heart
condition,
don't
approach
you.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
this
court
has
also
said
in
those
same
contexts...
mr.
chief
justice,
my
time
is
expired.
would
the
court
like
me
to
respond?
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
difference
is
there
the
question
was
was
the
conduct
going
to
aggravate
what
was
going
on
inside,
and
because
the
courts
there
gave
a
narrowing
construction
that
only
when
it...
it
violates
what's
going
on
inside
or
causes
a
problem,
that
there
would
be
a
violation.
that's
not
the
case
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
