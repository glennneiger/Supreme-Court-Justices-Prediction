mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
colorado
legislature
acted
to
protect
sick,
disabled,
and
vulnerable
people
on
their
way
to
and
from
its
hospitals
and
doctor's
offices.
and
it
designed
the
statute
to
keep
our--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that's
what
i
said,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no.
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect
medical
patients
who
are
often
sick,
disabled,
and
who
are
vulnerable--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--your
honor,
the...
the
statute
covers
all
persons
within
100
feet
of
a
medical
facility,
and
a
great
percentage
of
those
people
are...
are
either
treating
individuals
who
are
sick
and
vulnerable
and
disabled
or
persons
who
are
seeking
treatment
from
these--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--the
statute
operates
to
the
extent
that
it
is
covered,
public
sidewalk
or
a
public
way.
and
so
if
there's
a
20-story
building--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--a
story
of
any
type,
it
would
be
the
entrance
to
the
building
which
contained
the
medical
facility--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--and
the
public
right-of-way.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no.
yes,
because
there's
entrance
to
a
medical
facility.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
your
honor,
it
was...
it's
narrowly
designed
to
affect
only
the
100
feet
within
a
medical
facility
or
a
hospital.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
well,
if
a
doctor's
office
is
contained
within
a...
a
private
building,
the
statute
would
not
be
operative
because
it
doesn't
involve
a
public
way
or
a
public
sidewalk.
the
statute
requires--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that's--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
operate
in
those
circumstances
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
100
foot
of
the
entrance
and
a
public
sidewalk,
and
also
i
don't
think,
as...
as
ordinary
course,
your
honor,
that
we
would
have
a
situation
where
persons
would
be
protesting
within
the
building.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
the
statute
uses
the
term,
justice
breyer,
health
care
facility,
and
it
states
that
a
health
care
facility
means
any
entity
that
is
licensed,
certified,
or
otherwise
authorized
or
permitted
by
law
to
administer
medical
treatment
in
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be.
it's
only
as
to
the
entrance
of
that
medical
facility.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
the
provision
states--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--within
100
feet
of
a
medical...
of
the
entrance
to
a
medical
facility.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
your
honor,
the
statute
only
operates
within
100...
of
a
medical...
100
feet
of
a...
entrance
to
a
medical
facility
and
on
a
public
sidewalk.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i
believe
they're
synonymous,
your
honor.
and
i...
i
read
the
narrow
statutory
definition
of
health
care
facility
which
is
in
the
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i
was...
your
honor,
the
best
location
of
the
statute
is
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
where
the
entire
statute
is
set
out
verbatim
on
pages--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--your
honor,
it's
narrowly
drawn
because
the
statute
only
operates
in
conjunction
with
entrance
to
a
medical
facility
and
a
public
side-way
or
walkway.
so,
if
there's
a
public--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--your
honor,
the
statute
is
predicated
upon
a
finding
by
the
colorado
legislature
that
it
is
imperative
to
protect
access
to
health
care
facilities
and
that
the
relationship
between
that...
that
location
and
a
public
sidewalk
is
the
object
of
the...
of
the
regulation.
those
two
operating
together--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--are
the
circumstances
in
which
it
would
apply.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
well,
your
honor,
again
because
the
statute
only
operates
as
to
a
public
sidewalk
or...
or
way...
public
way,
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
statute
operates
outside
the
facility
within...
within
a--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
but
the
entrance
is
located
in
conjunction
with
the
public
sidewalk
and
the
public
way.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no,
not
as
if,
your
honor.
it...
it
would
constitute
an
entrance
to
the
health
care
facility
if
the
building
contained--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
hypothetical
has
not
been
discussed
by
the
legislature
nor
has
it
been
discussed
by
the
court.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i'm
not...
i'm
not
asking
the...
the
court
to
accept
my
interpretation.
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
not
looked
at
this
issue,
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
reviewed
the
statute
otherwise
and
has
upheld
it.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i
think
it
does
apply
in
conjunction--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--if
it's...
if
it's
in
connection
with
a
public
way
and
a
public
sidewalk.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i...
i
didn't
mean
to
use
the
word
in
a
haphazard
fashion.
i...
there's
no
question
in
the
position
of
the
state
of
colorado--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that
it
applies
to
the
entrance
of
a
health
care
facility
in
connection
with
a
public
sidewalk
or
a
public
way.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
focus
of
the
statute
is
with
100
feet
of
the
entrance.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no,
your
honor.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--there
has
never
been
a
prosecution
under
the
statute.
the
statute--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--has
never
been
enjoined.
there's
never
been
a
civil
complaint
for
damages,
nor
has
there
been
a
criminal
complaint
filed
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
don't
also
have
the
empire
state
building
in
colorado.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
it
covers
all--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--all
conduct
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
statute
which
occurs
within
100
feet
of
a
health
care
facility.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
would
violate
content
neutrality.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
it
would
apply
to
labor
picketing
under
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case
if
you
were
within
100--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
because
again
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
to
govern
all...
all
forms
of--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--that...
that
may
well
be
the
result,
justice
breyer,
that
the
operation
of
the
federal
law
would...
would
affect
the
statute
that
way.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in...
and
in
those
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
the...
that
the
patients
are
entitled
to
consideration
under...
under
the
rule
and
that
in
this
particular
case
our
statute
is
also
designed
to
protect
the
patients.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
i
am
aware
that--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--your
honor,
the
colorado
legislature,
in
its
review
of
the
statute,
first
of
all,
we've
never
employed
the
term
innocent.
we've
simply
determined
that
they
are
ill,
that
they
are
vulnerable,
and
that
they
are,
as
medical
patients,
entitled
to
consideration
under
the
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
your
honor,
what
the
statute
singles
out
and
what
the
statute
focuses
upon
is
the
approach
in
a...
in
a
circumstance
which
can
arise
and
become,
as
this
court
recognized
in...
in
the
schenck
case,
a
constructive
obstruction.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i
think
the
reason
this
has
a
different
under...
under-support
than
labor
picketing
is
because
it
focuses
solely
on
people
within
100
feet
of
a
health
care
facility.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
and
that
these
people
are
entitled
to
special
protection
as
found
by
our
legislature.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
it...
it
would
apply--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--it
applies
to
both
sides
or
all
the
multiple
sides
of
the
debate
because
it
is
a
content-neutral
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
subsection
2
only
deals
with,
in
our...
in
our
view,
physical
contact
between
persons
and--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--what
this
covers
by
the
establishment
of
the
8-foot
zone
of
separation
is
it
allows
a
normal
conversation
to
occur.
it
is
a
speech
inducing,
it's
a
speech
allowing,
it's
a
speech
endorsement,
and
that
is...
that
is
what
this
statute
allows
that
the
other
statute
doesn't
address.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
the
other
section
just
deals
with
physical...
physical
contact
and...
and
physical
obstruction
without...
without
regard
to
the
proximity
between
the...
the
willing
listener
and...
and
the
demonstrator.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it's
important
for
us
to
point
out
again
in
front
of
this
court
that
from
8
feet
away
all
forms
of
expression,
irrespective
of
their
content,
are...
are
encouraged,
allowed,
and
permitted
under
the
statute--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--your
honor,
8
feet
is
a
normal
conversational
tone.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
this
courtroom--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but
everybody
that
you
communicate
with
is
a
willing
listener.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
but
if
i
may,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--yes,
ma'am.
but
if
i
may,
your
honor,
8
feet
is
the
precise
distance...
on
an
earlier
occasion,
we
were
permitted
by
the
marshal
to
measure
the
distances
in
this
courtroom
and
8
feet
is
the
distance
from
this
podium
to
the
edge
of
the
court
where
the
chief
justice
sits.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
it's
not
content-based
because
it
allows...
it
takes
no
side
on
the
debate.
it...
it
simply
designates
a--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--all...
all
debates
on
the...
no
subject.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
again,
within
the
100...
100-foot
from
an
entrance
of
a
facility,
it
allows
completely
for
both
uninhibited
debate
on
all
topics
and
it
allows
it
if
the
listener
wants--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--it
doesn't
foreclose
discussions,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
all
discussions
can
occur
from
8
feet,
and
if
the...
if
the
listener
is
willing
to
allow
a...
a
person
to
approach...
and
again,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
8
feet
is
a
very
common
sense
thing.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
if
it...
yes,
yes,
it
would.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
if
it
meets
the
statutory
definition,
oral
protest,
education,
or--
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
--i
think
probably
you
would
go
to
your
insurance
carrier,
if
you
have
one,
or
you
would
go
to
your
doctor
and
you
would
want
to
make
sure
that
you
would
have
access
to
your
doctor
because
the
colorado
legislature
has
provided
that
you
will
have
that
access
through
the
operation
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
mclachlan
again,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
there
is
no
prohibition.
there
is
simply
a
minimal
restriction,
a
minimal
burden
with
inside
of
the
8
feet.
