unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
no
speech,
no
words,
are
prohibited.
it's
only
distance.
you
can
speak
anything
you
want
at
an
8-foot
distance.
unknown
speaker
but
even
in
the
zone,
as
long
as
you're
8
feet
away,
you
can
speak.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it...
what
is
it
that...
i
mean,
8
feet.
you're
16
feet
away
from
me.
8
feet
is
about
the
distance
to
mrs.
underwood
here.
what...
what
is
it
that
she
can't
tell
me?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
speech
is
it
difficult
for
anyone
to
make
when
you're
about
this
8
feet,
say,
the
distance
between
me
and
justice
kennedy?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
schenck
i
suppose
the
problem
was
that
you
couldn't...
you
didn't
know
where
the
bubble
started.
somebody
walking
along
the
sidewalk...
you
carried
the
bubble
with
you.
they
didn't
know
where
they're
supposed
to
be.
now,
there's
none
of
that
problem
here.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't...
i
thought
the
problem
in
the
other
case
was
that
as
the
person
walked
along
the
sidewalk,
people
who
were
just
standing
on
the
sidewalk
would
have
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
the
person
carrying
the
bubble
moved
along.
but
here
anyone
on
the
sidewalk
simply
stops.
there's
no
problem.
they
can
come
within
1
feet,
but
if
the
woman
wants
to
avoid
that
person,
the
person
can't
chase
after
her.
unknown
speaker
now,
is...
am
i
right
about
that
factually?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what--
unknown
speaker
--i'm...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't...
i
wasn't
clear.
i
didn't
say
it
didn't
float.
i
said
that
a
person
standing
on
the
sidewalk,
as
the
woman
approaches,
if
the
person
stands
still,
the
person
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
even
if
the
woman
comes
within
6
inches.
unknown
speaker
but
if
in
fact
the
woman
decides
she
doesn't
want
to
go
close
to
that
person
and
walks
around
him,
then
he
cannot
chase
her.
now,
that's
my
understanding
of
how
it
worked
physically.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
like
in
madsen.
in
madsen,
at
least
the
court
assumed
they
would
have
had
to
move
out
of
the
bubble.
that's
what
i
remember
the
chief
justice's
opinion
said,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
chief
justice's
opinion
interpret
it
as
requiring
the
stand-by
to
move?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
remind
me...
my
original
question
was
this,
and
it
may
just
require
reminding
me
of
what
these
other
cases
said.
but
if
i'm
standing
still
and
i...
people
can
approach
me,
and
then
i'm
about
the
distance
i
am
from
justice
kennedy.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
a
woman
coming
along.
what
is
it...
because
she
can
walk
around
me...
that
i
can't
tell
her?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
speech
case.
what's
the
restriction
on
the
speech?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
distance,
mr.
sekulow?
it
was
more
than
8
feet.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
but
the
distance
must
make
some
difference,
mr.
sekulow.
perhaps
the
difference
between
8
feet
and
15
doesn't,
but
if
you
got
down
to
3
feet,
for
example,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
there's
any
message
you
can't
communicate
at
a
distance
of
3
feet.
the...
the
distance
requirement
would
impede
you.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
just
impeding.
it's
also
intimidating.
it's
also
threatening.
i...
i
suppose
you
would
acknowledge
that...
what
about
2
inches?
i
mean,
you
know,
going
nose
to
nose
to
someone,
thrusting
your...
your
head
right
in
their
face.
certainly
that
could
be
prohibited.
that's
intimidating
behavior.
unknown
speaker
no.
they're
just
2
inches
away
and
not
blocking
access.
they
just
come
up
and
thrust
their...
their
face
right
in
front
of
me,
just
like
this.
unknown
speaker
have
you...
i
don't
think
you've
answered
the
question.
supposing
it
said
1
foot.
would
that
be
bad
too?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
the
same,
okay.
unknown
speaker
how
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch?
an
eighth
of
an
inch?
unknown
speaker
really,
your
client
holds
some
very
unreasonable
territory.
unknown
speaker
but
speech
on
a
public
forum,
the
traditional
concept
is,
you
know,
there's
somebody
on
a
soapbox
and
a
bunch
of
people
gathered
around
them,
not
that
you're
one
on
one
with
someone
an
eighth
of
an
inch
away.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
abrams
against
united
states,
they
threw
them
out
of
a
second
story
window...
the
leaflets.
unknown
speaker
would
you
acknowledge,
mr.
sekulow...
would
you...
no,
i
gather
you
would
not
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
have
such
a
law
which
limited
the
bubble
to
a
distance
which
is
inherently
intimidating.
you
just...
you
just
don't
acknowledge
that
there's
any
distance
at
which
you
can
talk
to
somebody
which
is
inherently
intimidating.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
obstructing,
detaining,
hindering.
i'm
just
intimidating.
i'm
just...
i'm
just
intimidating.
what
if
i...
my
nose
touched
your
nose?
oh,
that
would
be
okay
even
though
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--what
makes
that
okay?
unknown
speaker
what
makes
that
okay?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you...
you
certainly
can
convey
anything
you
want
to
convey
orally
from
a
distance
of
8
feet.
it's
just
not
difficult.
you
can
speak
in
a
normal
conversational
tone
and
be
heard
fully.
and
to
distribute
a
leaflet,
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
6
inches
away
or
8
feet
away,
the
person
receiving
it,
in
order
to
receive
it,
has
to
accept
it.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
this
isn't
some
unusual
provision.
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you
don't
say
that
a
person
must
accept
the
leaflet.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
person
to
whom
it's
offered
wants
to
take
it
under
this
statute,
they
can
and
will.
i
mean,
it's
just--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
would
be
the
same
if
it
were
1
foot
or
8
feet.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow,
on...
on
that,
i
understood
you
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question
by
saying
that
the
stationary
speaker,
so-called,
could
not
even
station...
in
a
stationary
position
offer
leaflets
without
violating
the
statute.
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
unknown
speaker
i'm
standing
still
and
somebody--
unknown
speaker
--gets
within
8
feet.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
can
say
to
that
person,
will
you
take
a
leaflet,
or
just
hold
the
leaflet
out.
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
if
you're
there
first
and
you're
stationary--
unknown
speaker
--you
can
do
that.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
then
being
that...
if
that's
the
case,
what's
exactly
the
problem?
i'm
not
just
saying
another
case.
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
the
problem
is.
i'm
standing
here.
i
plunk
myself
down
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
abortion
clinic.
anyone
who's
walking
into
that
abortion
clinic
has
to
pass
me,
and
i
simply
hold
out
the
leaflet.
now,
if
a
woman
wants
the
leaflet,
she'll
take
it,
but
if
she
walks
around
me,
now
she
doesn't
want
it.
so,
what's
the
problem
if
i
can
stand
still,
hand
it
out
just
like
this,
and
she'd
have
to
walk
around
in
order
to
avoid
taking
it,
but
she's
free
to
walk
around
under
this
statute?
what's
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
how
practically?
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
this
were
a
parade,
you
know,
of
people
marching
double-file
to
get
into
the
clinic
where
the
question
of
whether
you
got
there
first
might
be
very
important.
i
mean,
certainly
there
are
times
when
no
one
is
coming
to
the
clinic.
there
a
person
has
a
perfect
opportunity
to
get
there
first.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow--
unknown
speaker
--may...
may
i
just
ask
kind
of
a
general
question?
and
i
think
it
was
the
heffron
case,
the
court
made
a
reference
to
the
importance
of
getting
access
to
the
willing
listener
and
the
willing
recipient.
now,
i
think
you'd
probably
agree
that
this
ordinance
doesn't
really
restrict
your
ability
to
communicate
with
a
woman
who
wants
to
receive
your
message.
it
really
does
pose
some
limit
on
the
leafleting
to
a
woman
who
presumably
doesn't
want
the
leaflet.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
you...
you
have...
it's...
there's
kind
of
a
dilemma,
it
seems
to
me.
you
either
have
to
assume
that
the...
that
you
have
a
right
to
make
the
unwilling
listener
take
the
leaflet,
which
doesn't
seem
it
would
work
in
the
real
world--
unknown
speaker
--but...
but
you
do
have
a
constitutional
right
to
give
her
an
opportunity
if
she's
a
willing
recipient,
either
the
doctor
or
the...
to
have
that.
and
doesn't
she
have
that...
assuming
it's
a
willing
person
interested
in
the...
in
the
leaflet?
unknown
speaker
but
see,
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
you
have
to
be
a
willing
listener
if
you're
in
the
8-foot
zone.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
not
a
willing
listener,
you're
not
going
to
take
the
leaflet
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
concentrating
on
the
leafleting
now
because,
it
seems
to
me,
that's
your
strongest
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow?
unknown
speaker
in
madsen,
we
said
that
an
injunction
would
be
judged
by
a
more
stringent
standard
than
a
statute,
and
here,
of
course,
we...
we
have
a
statute,
not
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
yet,
you
frequently
refer
to
madsen
as
if
the
things
were
interchangeable.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
talk
about
that
one?
you've
been
just
talking
about
your
point
that
the
mere...
the
mere
consent
requirement
invalidates
it.
you
also
contend
that
this
is
a...
a
content-based
restriction.
how
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
can
you...
can
you
tell
me?
suppose
someone
wanted
to
encourage
a...
a
patient
to
get
a
particular
procedure.
would
that
be
barred
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
it's...
it's
not
protest.
it's...
it's--
unknown
speaker
--encouraging
the
person.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
feel?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
which
is
it?
i
mean,
i
grant
you
it's...
you
may
not
have
a
good
answer
to
this
because
i
have
a
hard
time
with
the
cases
on
this
one.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
they...
if
the
state
tries
to
write
a...
one
that
covers
more
than
just
abortion
clinics
and
tries
to
go
beyond
just
as
you've
said...
you
said,
well,
this
is
terrible.
it...
it
gets
innocent
things
like
what
time
is
it.
but
then
if
they
try
to
be
more
narrow,
you
say,
well,
it's
too...
it's
too...
it's
too...
it's
narrow.
i
mean,
either
they
didn't
narrowly
tailor
it--
unknown
speaker
--or...
or
if
they
do
narrowly
tailor
it,
it's
content
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
whenever
the
state
would
try
to
regulate
anything,
they'd
fall
into
the
one
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
precedent
which
defines
narrow
tailoring
by
whether
or
not
it's
content-based?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow,
i
was
reading
your
brief
closely
and
trying
to
envision
the
statute
that
would
be
constitutional.
the
chief
has
reminded
you
that
the
court
has
held
that
the
statute,
which
is
passed
when
it...
we
don't
know
who
the
particular
people
are,
requires
less
rigid
review.
so,
reading...
reading
your
brief,
i
had
the
impression
that
no
statute,
other
than
the
one
that
bars
obstruction,
would
do
in
your
judgment,
that
you
could
not
have
a...
a
statute
like
madsen
or
schenck
had
an
injunction.
you
simply
couldn't.
unknown
speaker
wait.
go...
go
back
for
a
second
because
certainly
you
would
agree
that
you
can
write
legislation
in
terms
of
categories
like
advertising
or
lawyer
solicitation,
counseling.
i
mean,
those
aren't
all
unconstitutional,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
to
talk
about
a
category
called
advertising
is
okay,
isn't
it?
our
cases
are
filled
with
that.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
content-based
because
you--
unknown
speaker
--treat
advertising
differently
from...
all
right.
so--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you
argue...
my
colleagues
admitted
you
argue,
on
one
hand,
the
statute
is
too
broad
and,
on
the
other
hand,
it's
too
narrow.
i
mean,
that's
like
the
old
arguments
we
used
to
get
here
about
the
establishment
clause.
if...
if
a...
if
the
state
tried
to
regulate
the
expenditure
of
funds
for
parochial
schools,
then
it
was
said
to
be
too
much
entangled,
and
there...
under
that
line
of
thinking,
there
was
nothing
the
state
could
do.
are
you
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
state
can't
draft
a
statute,
any
kind
of
a
statute,
to
cover
what
it
conceives
to
be
this
problem
here?
unknown
speaker
well...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
you
were
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
you
should
use
the
subjunctive.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
they
have
that
statute.
they
have--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
and
i
asked
you
before
and
you,
i
thought,
were
quite
candid
in
saying
that's
all
they
can
do.
unknown
speaker
--section
2
and
there's
no
other
statute
that
would
satisfy
your
test.
unknown
speaker
it
could
not
go
beyond
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
asked
you
if
there
was
any
statute
that
tried
to
replicate--
unknown
speaker
--or
controls
the
injunctions
that
we
have
permitted--
unknown
speaker
--but
as
i
remember
boos
at
least,
that
was
a
one
viewpoint.
you
couldn't
picket
against
the
embassy,
but
you
could...
no...
there
was
no
prohibition
on
doing
something
they
were
of.
and
here,
the
statute
is
written
in
neutral
terms.
it
says
you
can't
counsel
about
either
side.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
educate
about
either
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
this
statute
makes
me
think,
in
a
way,
of
the
city
of
renton
case
where
the
concern
was
the
secondary
effects
of
the
conduct.
it
was
first
amendment
activity,
the
adult
theater.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
secondary
effects
being
addressed,
and
maybe--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
situation
here,
that
the...
the
state
doesn't
care
on
which
side
of
the
message
it
is,
but
is
concerned
about
the
secondary
effects
of
intimidation...
intimidating
conduct
near
a
medical
facility.
unknown
speaker
but
we--
unknown
speaker
--we
take
the
case,
i
think,
on
the
assumption
that
colorado
has
tried
to
do
that
and
cannot
enforce
it
if
there
are
crowds.
the
problem
here
is
crowds.
and
so,
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
have
a...
a
zone
where
we
know
who
is
coming
up
to
push
or
pinch
or
shove,
and
that's
all
they're
trying
to
do.
is
that
a...
is
that
a
fair
assessment
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was?
maybe
they
failed,
maybe
they...
maybe
they
succeeded.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow,
can
i
ask...
i'm
really
seeking
information
here
on
your
position.
i
thought
there
was
some
tension
between
your
quoting
the
engaging
in
oral
protest,
education,
or
counseling
as
being
content-based
and
not
viewpoint-neutral
on
the
one
hand
and
saying
that
those
words
would
cover
the
delivery
of
a
pizza
solicitation.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
that
is
not...
that
is
not
content-based--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
sekulow.
mr.
mclachlan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
just
sick,
disabled,
or
vulnerable
people?
is
that...
is
the
only--
unknown
speaker
--it
only
protects
those
people?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
cover
just
medical
patients.
how
many...
what...
what
percentage
of
the
people
going
in
and
out
of...
of
these
facilities
do
you
think
are
sick...
what
was
it...
sick,
vulnerable
and...
and
whatnot?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
a
very
small
percentage
of
the...
of
the
universe
covered
by
this
thing,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
in...
in
that
respect,
how
does
this
statute
work?
suppose
there's
a
seven-story
building
and
on
the
sixth
floor
there
are
doctors'
offices.
on...
on
the...
all
of
the
other
floors,
there
are
other
businesses.
i
take
it
this
statute
operates
with
respect
to
anyone
who
engages
in
the
prohibited
activity
outside
the
main
entrance
to
the
building?
unknown
speaker
so,
if--
unknown
speaker
--so--
unknown
speaker
--so,
with
respect
to
all
of
the
businesses
in
those
buildings,
the
press,
lawyers,
business
people,
people
engaged
in
manufacturing
that
might
affect
the
environment,
this
statute
happens
to
apply
just
because
there's
a
doctor's
office
there.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
that's...
that
that's
whimsical
and
imprecise
and
inconsistent
with
our
speech
precedents.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
just
discussed
the
hypothetical
in
which
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
i...
i...
my
hypothesis
is
a
private
building
that
has
an
entry
off
a
public
sidewalk--
unknown
speaker
--which
i
assume
most
buildings
do.
unknown
speaker
sorry.
i
didn't...
i
didn't
pick
this
up
in
the
briefs.
so,
what
is
the
definition
of
a
medical
facility?
if
you
have
the...
the
russell
building
which
is
20
floors
high,
and
on
floor
18
there's
a
doctor,
and
on
all
the
other
floors
it's
a
lawyer,
is
the
whole
russell
building
a
medical
facility
under
this
statute?
i
mean,
if
that...
if
that's
the
problem
with
this,
i'm
surprised
that
i
didn't
pick
it
up
in
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
guess
that...
that
floor
18
or...
has
office
number
1806
is
the
medical
facility.
is
the
whole
building
a
medical
facility?
unknown
speaker
right.
the
crucial
provision
is
the
entrance...
is
the
entrance
provision.
how
does
that
read?
to
what
does
the
100-foot
restriction
apply?
unknown
speaker
within
100
feet
of
what?
unknown
speaker
of
the
entrance
to
a
medical
facility.
now,
do
you
consider
that
to
be
the
entrance
to
the
building
and
not
the
entrance
to
the...
to
the
office
in
which
the...
in...
in
a
large
building
the
facility
is
contained?
unknown
speaker
now,
mr....
mr.
mclachlan,
in
section
2
on
page
65a,
it
uses
the
term
health
care
facility.
you
said
medical
facility.
is
that
the
word
used
somewhere
else,
or
is
that
just
a
synonym
for
health
care
facility?
unknown
speaker
where...
where
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
is...
am
i...
where...
where
does
this
issue
that
justice
kennedy
just
raised
fit
in
this
case,
that
the
reason
that
it's
too
broad
is
it
would
cover
offices
that
are
located
within
some
large,
downtown
office
building
that
don't
have
doctors
in
it?
now,
has
that
suddenly...
what's
your...
what's...
what's
the
reaction
to
that
issue
in
the
context
of--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
want
to
distract
the
court
on
an
issue
that
wasn't
briefed,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
troublesome
and
i
would
read
the
statute...
and
i
thought...
and
i
think
that's
your
answer,
that
it
applies
to
anybody
on
the...
on
the
sidewalk
of
that
building.
but
the
point...
the
reason
i
brought
it
up
at
the
point
that
i
did
was
it
indicates
that
your
opening
statement,
which
is
that
this
is
for
the...
for
the
vulnerable
and
the
sick,
is
not
a
ground
on
which
we
can
sustain
a
statute.
the...
the
statute...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
there's
a
high
percentage
of
these
people
that...
that
are
on
these
sidewalks
fit
that
category.
i
think
you
would
have
to
make
a
different
argument
to
sustain
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
mclachlan,
now
as
i
recall
in
madsen,
it
was
a
free-standing
clinic.
you
know,
we
had
diagrams
and
so
forth,
and
the...
the
clinic
was
the
only
operation
in...
in
the
building.
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothesis,
you're
really...
you're
curtailing
a
lot
of
other
activity
that
would
otherwise
take
place
that
may
be
not
at
all
related
to
the
health
care
facility.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
that's
the
whole
point.
there
are
all
kinds
of
people
with
all
kinds
of
views
and
all
kinds
of
messages
and
all
kinds
of
purposes
on
a
public
sidewalk.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr....
mr.
mclachlan,
i
thought
a
moment
ago
your
answer
to
the
18-story
building
hypothesis
was
that
the
medical
facility
was
the
office
up
on...
whatever
it
was...
the
16th
floor.
it
was
not
the
whole
building.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
if
there
is
one
doctor's
office
on
the
16th
floor,
the
whole
sidewalk
and
entrance
is
subject
to
this
regulation
by
the
statute
as
if
the
entire
building
were
filled
with
doctors'
offices?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
saying
that
if
there's
a
doctor's
office
on
any
floor
of
the
skyscraper,
that
the
entrance
and
the
sidewalk
is
subject
to
regulation
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mclachlan,
if
there's
a--
--may
i
ask
if
any
colorado
judge
or
anybody
in
the
legislature
ever
discussed
this
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
for
you
to
say.
it's
for
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
answer
that
hypothetical,
and
they
have
not,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if
you're
talking
about
a
statute
that
abridges
freedom
of
speech
or
is
alleged
to,
it...
it
can't
be
vague.
i
mean,
we've...
you've
got
to
be
able
to
tell
from
reading
the
statute
just
where
it
applies.
now,
you've
given...
given
an
interpretation
and
we've
often
accepted
the
statement
of
the
state
solicitor
general
in
the
absence
of
any
decision
from...
from
a
colorado
court
on
the
subject.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
case
that
you
want
us
to
do,
that
we...
we
now
accept
as
the...
to
turn
this
case
on
your
interpretation
of
a
matter
that
hasn't
come
up
before
i
gather,
and
that
you're
saying
officially
in
your
role
as
a
representative
of
the
state
that
it
does
apply
to
an
18-story
office
building
on
the...
on
the
sidewalk
where
there's
nobody
but
one
doctor
up
on
the
18th
floor
and
stops
everybody
else
from
speaking
about
anything?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
statute
ever
been
applied--
--you
don't...
you
don't
want
us
to
accept
the
opposite
interpretation
either,
do
you?
do...
are
you
willing
to
say
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the...
to
the
entrance
of
a
facility
where
there's
a
doctor's
office
on
the
16th
floor?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
does.
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
does,
and
although
you're
not
willing...
you're
not
willing
to
say
authoritatively
that
it
does?
unknown
speaker
that
it
does.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
so
even
if
the
health
care
facility
on
the
18th
floor
is
more
than
100
feet
away
from
the
sidewalk.
vertically.
yes.
unknown
speaker
has
the
statute
ever
been
applied
in
the
fashion
you...
you
maintain
it
would
apply?
has
there
ever
been
a
prosecution--
unknown
speaker
--the
answer
is
no.
unknown
speaker
for
anybody.
unknown
speaker
but
even
in
the
case--
--there's
probably
never
been
an
abortion
protest
outside
the
empire
state
building
either.
unknown
speaker
is...
excuse
me.
is
this
statute
just
addressed
to
abortion
protests?
is...
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
didn't
think
it
was.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
bad
if
it
was
addressed
just
to
abortion
protests,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
it
applies
to
labor
picketing?
unknown
speaker
so,
a
labor
organization
has
a
different
rule
if
it's
in
front
of
a
health
facility
than
it's...
if
it's
in
front
of
a
manufacturing
plant.
unknown
speaker
that's...
is
that
content-based?
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
the
nlrb,
if
it
turned
out
to
be
a
labor
problem,
could
preempt
any
effect
of
colorado's
state
law
in
respect
to
the
labor
unions,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what--
--except
in
the
labor
law,
we
said
there
are
different
rules
apply
to
medical
facilities
than
apply
to
other
facilities.
unknown
speaker
i'm
curious.
you
know,
i'm
sure
there...
there
has
been
violence
in...
in
some
abortion
protests.
are
you
aware
that
there's
been
more
violence
in
that
context
than
in
labor
picketing,
for
example?
i
mean,
the
number...
the
number
of
people
killed
or
the
number
of
people
intimidated
in
in
labor
protests
annually.
do
you
think
it's--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
just
wondering
why...
you
know,
why
this
is
a...
a
great...
this
particular
area
is
of...
is
of
great
concern
to
the...
i
don't
know.
people
going
into
supermarkets
that
are
being
picketed...
are
they...
are
they
any
less...
what...
vulnerable
and...
i
forget
what
your
other
adjectives
were.
it's
curious
that
this
need
to
protect
the
innocent
and
vulnerable
from...
from
being
approached
is...
is
felt
only
in
this
one...
one
area.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder
whether
the
statute
is...
is,
you
know,
although
facially
applicable
to
anybody
who...
who
approaches
this
kind
of
facility,
i
think...
i
think
we
know
what
it's
aimed
at,
which
is
abortion
protests.
and
i
just
wonder
what
justification
there
is
for
singling
them
out
as
being
particularly
intimidating
as
opposed
to,
let's
say,
labor
picketing.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words--
--you
could...
you
could
at
least
apply
this
rationale
that
you're
defending
here...
you
acknowledge
that
it
could
be
applied
to
labor
picketing.
if...
if
you
had
a
similar
finding
by
the
legislature
that
labor
picketing
can
be
intimidating,
you
could
require
all
labor
pickets
to...
within
100
feet
of
whatever
they're
picketing,
to
stay
8
feet
away
from
people.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
understand,
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
would
apply
to
labor
people
who
were
trying
to
educate
the
public
about
a
labor
union
matter,
people
who
were
objecting
to
the
facility
charging
too
much
money,
people
who
were
objecting
to
the
facility's
use
of
animals
in
experimenting.
they
would
all
come
under
the
same
rules.
unknown
speaker
what--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
tell
us
what
this
portion
of
the
statute
accomplishes
that
subsection
2
does
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
it
deals
with
knowingly
obstructing,
detaining,
impeding,
and
so
forth.
now,
it's...
it's
hard
for
me
to
know
what
this
covers
that
that
wouldn't
also
cover.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--we
don't
ordinarily
think
that
to...
to
be
able
to
speak
you
have
to
have
state
authorization
or
permission
to
speak.
the...
the
view
is
almost
to
the
contrary
that
you
can
speak
unless
there's
valid
prohibition
against
speech.
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
could
say
that
from...
from
100
feet
if
you
use
a...
you
know,
a
bullhorn,
but...
but
you
can't...
what
the...
what
these
abortion
protestors,
which
is
what
this
is
directed
at,
generally
do
is...
is...
like
to
say,
you
know,
my
dear,
have
you
really
considered
the
consequences?
are
you
going
to
shout
this?
my
dear,
have
you
really
considered?
it's
a
totally
different...
it's
a
totally
different
enterprise
when
you
do
it
from
8
feet
away.
you
can't
really
seriously
say
that
there's
no
difference
between
approaching
someone
quietly,
confidentially
and
speaking
in...
in
that
kind
of
a
manner
and
shouting
whatever
you
want
to
do
from
8
feet
away.
you...
you
really
assert
that
there's
no
difference?
unknown
speaker
it
is?
unknown
speaker
my
goodness,
i...
i
rarely
stand
8
feet
away
from
somebody
that
i'm
talking
to.
i
don't
stand
an
eighth
of
an
inch,
and...
and
if
that's
what
the
distance
was,
i...
i'd
have
no
problem
here.
but
8
feet?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i...
i
think
not.
don't
be
so
sure.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
don't
be
too
sure.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
this
a
content-based
statute
if
what
it
does
is
foreclose
discussion
of
all
the
issues
justice
ginsburg
was
mentioning
with
relation
to
the
health...
health
care
system?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
this
content-based
because
it
has...
imposes
a
special
burden
on
people
who
want
to
discuss
issues,
all
of
the
ones
justice
ginsburg
raised
and
more,
hmo
cost,
et
cetera,
with
reference
to
the
health
system?
unknown
speaker
it
forecloses
all
debate
on
that
subject.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
subject
of
health
care.
that's
the
whole
justification
for
the
statute
or
how
the
health
care
facilities
are
being
operated.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
the
statute
is
not
content-based
if
it
forecloses
discussions
on
both
sides
of...
of
a
particular
subject.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
my
definition
of
content--
unknown
speaker
--this
would
cover
a
protest
over
the
death
penalty
as
well
as
something
to
do
with
health
care,
wouldn't
it?
would
this
statute
apply
to
somebody
who
wants
to
speak
about
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
not
only
point
of
view,
but
also
a
wide
range
of
subject
matter
can
be
spoken
in...
in
this
kind
of
activity.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
interested
in
health
care
issues,
do
you
go
to
a
health
care
facility
or
to
the
zoo?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
wouldn't
it
suffice
for
the
concerns
of
the
state
here
to...
to
prohibit
any
intimidating
approach
by
speech
or
otherwise?
i
mean,
what
the
state
has
prohibited
here
is
speech.
it's
the
only
thing
that
is
prohibited
is
speech,
not
intimidation,
not
approaching.
why
wouldn't
prohibiting
an
intimidating
approach
suffice?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mclachlan.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood--
--if...
if
that
is
so
reasonable,
i
assume
it...
it
could
apply...
could
be
applied
to
normal
labor
picketing
at
any
facility.
i
mean,
it's
so
reasonable.
you
can
say
whatever
you
want.
you
can...
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
applied
to
normal
labor
picketing?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
violence
in...
you...
you
unaware
that
there...
that
there
have
occurred
instances
of
violence
and
intimidation
in
labor
picketing?
unknown
speaker
we
can
make
the
same
finding
they
have
here
and
say
all...
all
picketing...
you
know,
we
apply
it
generally
to
all...
all
commercial
establishments.
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
some
problem
about...
about
not
letting
somebody
come
closer
than
8
feet.
you're
not--
unknown
speaker
--not
a
real--
--so,
you're
saying,
ms.
underwood,
that...
you
know,
supposing
colorado
on
the
basis
of
things
that
happened
out
there
in
the
early
20th
century...
read
moyer
against
peabody
if
you
want
to
find
out
about
it.
and
there
is
violence
in
labor
picketing.
we're
going
to
impose
this
same
regulation.
you
say
that
would
be
judged
by
a
different
standard,
or
that
it
would...
that
it
would
fail,
whereas
this
would
succeed?
that's
a
very
strange
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
or
might...
wouldn't
it
be
for
the
labor
board
in
the
labor
case...
the
constitutional
issue
has
to
presuppose
that
the
labor
board
made
findings
like
colorado
and
then,
as
a
labor
law
matter,
laid
it
down.
and
the
question
would
be
is
that
unconstitutional
if
the
labor
board
did
it.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why
do
you
say
that's
right
in
this
very
peripheral
discussion?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
colorado
passes
a
statute
affecting
labor
picketing
this
same
way
and
it
is
simply
challenged
on
a
first
amendment
basis.
the
labor
board
doesn't
even
get
into
it.
i
take
it
that
the
answer
you
gave
to
my
question
is...
is
the
correct
one.
unknown
speaker
is
it
necessary
that
there
be
hearings
and
findings
in
order
to
sustain
a
statute
like
this?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there...
there
is
federal
legislation,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
a
federal
freedom
of
access
to
clinic
entrances
act?
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
that
differ
from
this?
and
was
that
factored
into
the
hearings
and
the
findings,
the
effect
of
that
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
in
the
two
cases
you
mentioned,
did
those
bans
refer
to
the
content
of
the
speech
as
this
one
does?
it's
only
that
speech
that
educates,
that
counsels,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
a
sudden
interest
in
the
automobile
industry,
could
colorado
have
these
speech
regulatory
zones
around
every
auto
dealership?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
like
that
term
speech
regulatory
zone?
that's
what
this
is.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
hypothetical?
approach
regulatory
zone?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
an
approach...
you
can
approach
as
close
as
you
like
so
long
as
you
don't
speak.
unknown
speaker
it's
only
the
person
who
approaches
to
speak
or
to...
or
to
hand
a
leaflet--
unknown
speaker
--who
is
prohibited.
unknown
speaker
approach
with
the
intention
of.
unknown
speaker
right.
with
the
intention
of
speaking.
unknown
speaker
or
you
could
do
this
just
for
auto
dealerships--
unknown
speaker
--or
law
offices.
how
about
lawyers?
any
law
office?
no.
unknown
speaker
and
what
i'm...
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
if
this
isn't
a
basis
to
say
that
this
is
content-controlled
and
not
content...
that
obviously
underlies
the
question.
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address.
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
message
that
goes
on
there.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
what
about...
what
about
the
consent
requirement?
now,
you
know,
we...
we
allow
people
to
prevent
unwelcome
speech
in
their
homes.
you
can
cancel,
you
know...
require
mail
not
to
be
delivered.
you
can
have
a
city
ordinance
saying
i
don't
want
any...
you
need
consent
before
hawkers
can
come
to
the
door.
but
in
the
public
forum
outside
in
the
street,
can...
can
we
have
a
law
that...
that
enables
people
to...
to
turn
off
unwelcome
speech?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
sekulow,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sekulow--
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--rather
than
every
time
getting
into
an
argument
about
what
constitutes
harassment.
unknown
speaker
that's
my
very
point.
why
isn't
it
more
precise
to
say
8
feet
than
to
say
in
each
case
we'll...
we'll
litigate
whether
my
waving
my
arm
or
something
like
that
did
or
did
not
constitute
harassment?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
sekulow,
isn't
there
something
different
about
a
hospital,
i
mean,
wholly
apart
from
the
question
of
abortion
clinics?
haven't
there
been
restrictions
on
speech
activity
around
schools?
i
mean,
mostly
the
problem
was
not
that
they...
you
couldn't
have
the
restriction,
but
you
couldn't
favor
one
speaker.
unknown
speaker
briefly.
