justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
colorado.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
1993
colorado
statute
that
regulates
speech-related
conduct
within
100-feet
of
the
entrance
to
any
healthcare
facility
in
the
state.
the
challenged
section
of
the
statute
makes
it
unlawful
within
the
regulated
areas
for
any
person
to
“knowingly
approach”
within
eight
feet
of
another
person,
without
that
person’s
consent,
“for
the
purpose
of
passing
a
leaflet
or
handbill
to,
displaying
a
sign
to,
or
engaging
in
oral
protest,
education,
or
counseling
with
such
other
person.”
petitioners
are
opponents
of
abortion
and
engage
in
a
practice
that
they
call
sidewalk
counseling.
they
regularly
attempt
to
inform
others
about
abortion
and
abortion
alternatives
outside
of
healthcare
facilities
through
verbal
speech,
signs,
and
distribution
of
literature.
although,
the
state
of
colorado
presented
evidence
that
demonstrations
in
front
of
abortion
clinics
sometimes
in
tdex
as
to
those
clinics
and
were
often
confrontational.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
ever
abusive
or
confrontational.
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioners
are
abridged
by
the
protection
the
statute
provides
for
the
unwilling
listener.
the
colorado
supreme
court
unanimously
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
a
valid
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions.
for
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
that
decision.
we
began
by
pointing
out
the
significant
difference
between
state
restrictions
on
a
speaker’s
right
to
address
a
willing
audience,
and
those
that
protect
unwilling
listeners
from
unwanted
communication.
this
statute
deals
only
with
the
latter.
it
is
significant
that
the
statute
does
not
place
any
limit
whatsoever
on
what
maybe
set
or
displayed
more
than
eight
feet
from
the
listener
and
it
doesn’t
place
any
limit
on
what
maybe
said
if
the
listener
consents
to
the
speaker
coming
within
eight
feet
of
the
speaker.
the
right
to
free
speech
of
course
includes
the
right
to
attempt
to
persuade
others
to
change
their
views,
and
may
not
be
curtailed
simply
because
the
speaker’s
message
maybe
offensive
to
his
audience,
but
the
protection
afforded
to
offensive
messages
does
not
always
embrace
speech
that
is
so
intrusive
that
the
unwilling
listener
cannot
avoid
it.
in
a
case
decided
in
1921
in
a
very
different
context,
chief
justice
taft
explained
the
interest
of
the
unwilling
listener
in
this
language,
“how
far
may
men
go
in
persuasion
and
communication,
and
still
not
violate
the
right
of
those
whom
they
would
influence?
in
going
to
and
from
work,
men
have
a
right
to
as
free
a
passage
without
obstruction
as
the
streets
afford,
consistent
with
the
right
of
others
to
enjoy
the
same
privilege.
we
are
a
social
people,
and
the
accosting
by
one
of
another
in
an
inoffensive
way
and
an
offer
by
one
to
communicate
and
discuss
information
with
a
view
to
influencing
the
other's
action
are
not
regarded
as
aggression
or
a
violation
of
that
other's
rights.
if,
however,
the
offer
is
declined,
as
it
may
rightfully
be,
then
persistence,
importunity,
following
and
dogging,
become
unjustifiable
annoyance
and
obstruction
which
is
likely
soon
to
savor
of
intimidation.
from
all
of
this
the
person
sought
to
be
influenced
has
a
right
to
be
free.”
the
unwilling
listener’s
interest
has
been
repeatedly
identified
in
our
cases.
it
is
an
aspect
of
the
broader
right
to
be
let
on
that
one
of
our
wisest
justice,
justice
brandeis
characterized
as
“the
most
comprehensive
of
rights
and
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
men.”
the
colorado
supreme
court
was
correct
to
conclude
that
this
regulation
is
a
content-neutral
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction.
it
was
not
adopted
because
the
state
disagreed
with
any
particular
message
and
the
state’s
interest
in
protecting
access
and
privacy
are
unrelated
to
the
content
of
the
demonstrator’s
speech.
petitioners
nevertheless
argued
that
the
statute
is
not
content-neutral,
because
an
individual
near
a
healthcare
facility
who
knowingly
approaches
a
pedestrian
to
say
good
morning
or
to
randomly
reside
a
few
lines
from
a
novel
would
not
be
subject
to
the
statute’s
restriction
of
oral
protest,
education
and
counseling.
this
argument
is
misplaced.
it
is
common
in
the
law
to
examine
the
content
of
a
communication
to
determine
the
speaker’s
purpose,
whether
a
particular
statement
constitutes
a
threat,
blackmail,
an
agreement
to
fix
prices,
a
copyright
violation,
a
public
offering
of
securities,
or
an
offer
to
sell
goods
often
depends
on
the
precise
content
of
the
statement.
at
most
the
necessary
review
under
this
statute
need
to
be
no
more
extensive
than
a
simple
determination
of
whether
a
general
prohibition
of
picketing
or
demonstrating
applies
to
innocuous
speech,
which
we
have
never
found
constitutionally
problematic.
the
colorado
statute’s
regulation
places
no
restrictions
on
and
clearly
does
not
prohibit
either
a
particular
viewpoint
or
any
subject
matter
that
may
be
discussed
by
a
speaker.
it
applies
equally
to
used
car
salesmen,
animal
rights
activists,
fundraisers,
environmentalists,
and
missionaries.
each
can
attempt
to
educate
unwilling
listeners
on
any
subject,
but
without
consent
may
not
approach
within
eight
feet
to
do
so.
we
also
agree
with
the
state
court’s
conclusion
that
the
section
is
narrowly
tailored.
we
are
persuaded
that
the
statute
leaves
open
ample
alternative
channels
for
communication.
additionally,
we
previously
have
noted
the
unique
concerns
that
surround
healthcare
facilities.
persons
who
are
attempting
to
enter
health
care
facilities
for
any
purpose
are
often
in
particularly
vulnerable,
physical
and
emotional
conditions.
the
state
of
colorado
has
responded
to
its
substantial
and
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
these
persons
from
unwanted
encounters,
confrontations,
and
even
assaults
by
enacting
a
modest
restriction
on
the
speakers’
ability
to
approach.
petitioners'
further
contemned
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
overbroad,
vague,
and
a
prior
restrained.
for
reasons
that
are
stated
than
rather
likely
opinion
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
o’connor,
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer,
we
reject
each
of
those
arguments.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
o’connor,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined,
and
justice
scalia
has
some
contrary
views
to
express.
