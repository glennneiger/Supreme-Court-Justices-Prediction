ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
this
statute,
petitioners
are
free
to
say
and
to
show
anything
they
want
to
people
near
a
health
care
facility.
they
can
shout
or
they
can
talk
in
normal
tones.
they
can
offer
literature
and
hold
up
signs
and
pictures
that
can
be
seen
by
their
target
audience.
they
can
station
themselves
where
the
patients
will
have
to
pass
by
much
closer
than
8
feet.
they
just
can't
move
toward
the
target
without
consent
once
the
distance
between
them
is
8
feet
or
less.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
not
a
general...
not...
not
a
general
statute
like--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
colorado
was
responding
to
a
particular
need.
if
the
same
need
existed,
which
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
the
court
has--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--colorado
hasn't
made
that
finding
that...
i
don't
think
that
finding
would
be
supported.
and
we
do
expect...
we
have
a
tradition
of
people
being
of
rather
more
robust
activity--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
is
a
first
amendment
issue.
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem
with
this
statute.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
if...
if
exactly
the
same
findings
and
exactly
the
same
need
were
found,
then
the
same
statute
would
be
upheld.
but
it--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
if
colorado
made
findings
that...
that
there
was
a
problem
of
violence
and
intimidation
that
arose
out
of
one-to-one
close...
close
approaches
of
the
sort
here
and
that
was
not
capable
of
being
dealt
with
in
any
other
way,
as
colorado
had
tried
to
do
here
and
that
a
statute
like
this
was
the
least
restrictive
or
at
least
the...
was
the
most
appropriate
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem,
then
such
a
statute
would
be
upheld.
there
is
no
such
finding
and
there
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
is
necessary
that
the
judgment
be
supported.
this
court
reviews
the
judgments
of
legislatures
with
some
deference
when
a
factual
matter
is
concerned
and
hearings
and
findings
are
helpful,
but
the
court
has
never
prescribed
a
particular
method
for...
for--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
there
is.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
this
statute
was
passed
before
the
federal
access
to
clinics
act
was
passed,
about
a
year
before.
under
the
federal
access
to
clinics
act,
an
injunction
can
issue
and,
in
at
least
one
case
that
we've
called
to
the
court's
attention,
has
issued,
that
imposes
a
similar
sort
of
restriction.
there
are
differences,
obviously,
between
the
way
injunctions
are
judged
and
the
way
statutes
are
judged,
but
that
some
evidence
that
under
the
federal
statute
it
has
been
found
necessary
by
courts,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
to
impose
a
no-approach...
a
small
no-approach
zone
in
order
to
protect
against
intimidation
and...
and
threats.
this
is
not
the
floating
bubble
of
schenck
or
the
no-approach
rule
of
madsen
for
several
reasons.
as...
as
has
been
noted,
the
target
can't
create
a
violation
here.
the
distance
in
question
is
8
feet
rather
than
15.
in
madsen,
while
there
was
a
no-approach
rule
that
the
court
rejected,
there
was
in
the
same
case
a
36-foot
absolute
ban
which
covered
most
of
the
approach
to
the...
to
the
facility
that
the
court...
that
the
court
upheld.
the
matter...
there
was
a
discussion
about
whether
this
is
content-based.
this
court
has
found
many
similar
bans
to
be
content-neutral.
i
understand
there's
an
argument
that
there
is
some
speech
that's
covered
and
some
not.
but
the
court
in
grace
held
that
the
ban
on
displays
was
content-neutral;
in
heffron,
that
the
ban
on
demonstrating...
that
the
ban
on
distributing
written
materials
was
content-neutral.
and
in
fact,
in
schenck
and
madsen,
it
found
that
those
injunctions
were
content-neutral.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
ban
in
grace
around
the
supreme
court
is
on
flags
and
devices
that
call
attention
to
an
organization,
a
movement,
or...
there
clearly...
there's
a
communicative
requirement
there
that's
quite
similar
to
this.
presumably
a
work
of
art
on
a
flag
would
not
qualify.
and
the
bans
in...
in
schenck
and
madsen,
the
ones
that
were
upheld,
as
well
as
the
ones
that
were
struck
down,
were
on
demonstrating,
which
again
is...
is
essentially
what
this
language
captures.
and
on
the
question
whether
we
can
look
behind
the...
the
words
to
its
purpose,
justice
scalia,
you
spoke
about
the
purpose
of
this.
first
of
all,
the
clear
purpose
of
the
colorado
legislature
was
to
reduce
the
risk
of
violence
and
intimidation
at
health
care
facilities,
not
just
at
reproductive
health
care
facilities
and
not
just
from
those
with
one
particular
viewpoint.
while
it's
true
that
the
anti-abortion
protests
generated
much
of
the
activity
that
led
to
the
statute,
the
legislature
was
clearly
aware
of
and
concerned
about
both
reciprocal
violence
by
pro-abortion
protestors--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--this
isn't
a...
first,
if
exactly
the
same
findings
were
made,
obviously,
it
seems
to
me--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
it's
an
approach
regulatory
zone,
and
i'd
like
to
take
issue
with
this--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
what
this
statute
prohibits
is
moving
in
on
somebody.
it
doesn't--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
that's
not
right.
you
have
the
purpose--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--with...
with
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--with
that
purpose.
actually
i'd
like
to
just
on
the
words
of
the
statute...
what
has
to
happen
is
an
approach.
the...
the
advocacy
aspect
of
the
statute
is
the
purpose.
you
don't
have
to
get
as--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--with
the
intent.
you
can
approach
without
intent--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--without
getting
to
the
point
of
speaking.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
if
there
were--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--if
there
were
a
problem--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
it's
not
content
control.
it
is
facility
protective.
there
is
a
problem
at
health
care
facilities,
a
problem
of
intimidation
and
violence,
that
colorado--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
actually
with
respect
to
a
great
many
messages,
although
there's
one
that
perhaps
is
more
common
than
others.
there
is
a
problem.
the
legislature
is
not
required
to
act
with
respect
to
problems
that
don't
exist.
and
if
you're
hypothesizing
a
world
in
which
people
are
intimidating
people
from
buying
cars
by
coming
up
close
to
them
in
their
face
and...
and
showing
them
pictures
of
automobile
accidents,
then
perhaps
colorado
would
want
to
do
something
and
could
do
something
like
what
it
did
here,
which
is
to
permit
them
to
show
those
pictures
and
to
permit
them
to
give
those
messages,
but
to
require
them
not
to
move
in
on
somebody
closer
than
8
feet.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
not
to
turn
off
unwelcome...
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
not
to
turn
off
unwelcome
speech.
to
repel
unwanted
close
approaches.
this
is
about
a
close
approach
and
not
about
speech
at
all.
