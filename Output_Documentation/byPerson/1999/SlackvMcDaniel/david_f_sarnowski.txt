mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
at
its
essence
is
about
whether
state
prisoners
may
file
serial
mixed
petitions
in
the
federal
courts
and
repeatedly
hail
the
state
into
federal
court
without
a
consequence,
as
long
as
they
assert
the
lack
of
a
prior
merits
decision
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
the
state
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--it
was
not.
the
circuit
court
motions
panel
of
two
judges
denied
it.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
having--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--we
believe
it
is,
having
reviewed
the...
what
amici
has
had
to
say
about
the
issue.
we
approached
this
case
by
opposing
in
the
district
court
the
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability,
which
was
sought
after
the
effective
date
of
aedpa,
in
fact,
2
years,
almost
2
years.
the
district
judge
having
earlier
disposed
of
an
argument
that
aedpa
did
apply
when
counsel
for
mr.
slack
asserted
that
it
did,
also
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
apply
the
old
probable
cause
rule
and
declined
it
accordingly.
we
did
oppose
that.
our
motion
papers
are
contained
in
the
appendix.
thus,
the
question
then
became
the
one
that
mr.
slack
initially
posed
to
the
court,
and
the
one
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
rather
than
the
jurisdictional
question
that
the
amici
have
briefed
at
some
length.
the
problem
with
mr.
slack's
suggestion
that
a
rule
of
civil
procedure,
and
specifically
rule
41,
could
apply
to
allow
the
district
court
some
control
over
the
litigation,
is
twofold.
number
1,
that
suggestion
was
never
asserted
by
mr.
slack
at
any
point
in
time
in
the
prior
proceedings,
and
it
has
been
heard
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
more
importantly,
it
would
then
leave
individual
application
of
individual
rules
to
apply
perhaps
in
individual
districts,
such
as
nevada,
which
does
not
have
multiple
federal
districts,
although
we
have
six
judges,
whereas
the
rule
that
we
made
our
motion
under
and
the
court
applied
to
this
case
is
a
system-wide
rule,
rule
9(b).
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
suggest
that
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
counsel
for
mr.
slack
to
have
informed
the
district
court,
judge
hagan,
before
the
case
ever
proceeded
to
the
circuit
court,
that
there
was
an
alternative
way
and
a
suggestion
that
mr.
slack
had
to
try
to
dispose
of
the
case,
such
that
he
wasn't
found
to
have
abused
the
writ.
and
we
need
to
recall
that
judge
hagan
just
didn't
file
an
outright
dismissal
order
based
on
our
moving
papers.
he
ordered
mr.
slack
to
explain
why,
after
we
had
properly
pled
abuse
of
the
writ,
why
he
hadn't
abused
it.
rather
than
doing
so,
mr.
slack
merely
reargued
his
point
that
he
argues
now,
is
that
rule
9(b)
doesn't
apply,
that
as
long
as
he
brings
in
mixed
petitions
serially,
there
is
no
control
and
there's
nothing
that
the
court
could
have
done
to
make
him.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
yes.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
yes.
the
first
petition
was
dealt
with
by
the
judge,
and
he
allowed
mr.
slack
to
return
to
the
state
courts.
this
case
is
not
about
whether
he'll
ever
get
a
review,
in
our
view,
on
those
claims
that
he
initially
identified.
it
was
only
what
judge
hagan,
the
district
judge,
felt
to
have
been
the
belatedly
included
and
unexhausted
issues
that
counsel
amended
into
the
second
petition.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
our
position
is
that
he...
under
the
rule,
he
is
not
allowed
to
include
additional
claims
beyond
those
that
he
had
already
identified.
of
course--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--that's
correct.
of
course,
it
would
thus
then
be
up
to
the
state
to
assert
any
affirmative
defense
that
may
be
available
to
it.
in
a
pre-aedpa
situation,
rule
9(b)--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--for
purposes
of
this
case...
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
presented...
it
is
a
more
difficult
question
as
we
look
at
the
abuse
rule
applied
to
those
facts.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that
is
our
position,
but
it's
always
up
to
the
state
to
assert
the
affirmative
defense,
and
if
it
does
so,
it's
then--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--if
the
judge
were
to
find
that
those
additional
new
and
different
grounds
that
you
say
in
your
hypothetical
were
not
included
in
the
first
petition,
if
he
finds
that
they
are
new
and
different,
then
under
the
rule,
assuming
we
asserted
the
affirmative
defense--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--correct.
those
are
the
two
predicates
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
farmer
requires,
that
they
be
new
and
different
grounds
alleged,
and
that
the
failure
to
assert
those
grounds
in
a
prior
petition
constituted
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
don't
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
farmer
to
go
nearly
that
far,
because...
and
we
have
never
argued
otherwise,
that
rule
9(b)
allows
discretion.
we
think
it
allows
much
more
discretion
than
the
aedpa
statutory
version
alluded
to.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
correct,
and
at
that
point,
that's
where
we
found
ourselves
in
this
case
when
judge
hagan
told
mr.
slack
to,
under
these
facts
to
explain
why
he
was
raising
new
issues.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
you
can
extend
the
same
logic--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--our
reading
of
the
rule
requires
us,
as
we
did
in
this
case,
to
affirmatively
plead
with
specificity
what
the
abuse
of
the
writ
consists--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--the
procedural--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--well,
relying
on
the
former
opinion,
we
rely
on
it
in
its
entirety,
and
the
circuit
court
instructed
us
through
that
opinion
that
the
requirement
is
to
plead
the
affirmative
defense.
it's
not
up
to
the
petitioner
to
come
in
and
say,
and
i'm
not
abusing
the
writ,
first.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
agree
with
that
statement,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
and
that
is
by
an
individual
case
determination
that
the
judge
makes.
here,
the
judge
had
no
explanation
whatsoever
for
mr.
slack.
rather,
he
merely
had
mr.
slack's
continuing
argument
that
the
rule
doesn't
apply
because
there
wasn't
a
merits
determination.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
there
was
an
argument,
i
believe,
to
that
effect
after
the
court's
dismissal,
when
mr.
slack
sought
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
i
frankly
do
not
recall
that
argument
having
been
made
prior
to
the
judge's
first
decision.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
in
the
federal
court,
that
is
correct.
he,
of
course,
had
counsel
at
trial
and
on
direct
appeal
in
the
state
court.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that's
correct.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
to
answer
the
first
prong,
while
a
judge
may
look
at
that
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion,
we
don't
understand
this
court's
jurisprudence,
and
particularly
now,
if
we
are
informed
by
aedpa,
the
section
of
aedpa
that
says
whatever
counsel
that
they
had
did
or
didn't
do
doesn't
matter,
i
know
of
no
case
that
says
that
if
a
federal
habeas
petitioner
didn't
have
a
lawyer
at
all,
that
that
is
excuse
enough.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
would
suggest
that
while
there
may
not
have
been
harm
in
the
literal
sense,
the
court
was
not
the
only
party
to
be
considered.
our
position
is
that
the
serial...
the
filing
of
serial
mixed
petitions
also
impacts
very
deleteriously
on
the
resources
of
the
state.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
did,
in
fact,
appear
in
the
second
case,
not
the
first
case
as
your
example
is
given
to
us,
and
under
mr.
slack's
theory,
he's
going
to
get
to
go
back
to
state
court,
and
we're
going
to
have
to
be
hailed
back
into
federal
court
again
and
do
all
the
things
that
we
do
to
respond.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
it
is,
chief
justice.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
no,
we
don't.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
no.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
would
state
that
then
the
rule...
and
i
believe
you're
referring
to
the
new
statute.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
now
i
understand
the
question
you
asked
me.
i...
they
have
the
same
meaning
in
both
instances.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
and
i'm...
i
would
agree.
i
misstated
the
answer
based
on
what
i
understood
your
question
to
be,
and
i
apologize.
you
can't
have
two
different
meanings--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--if
that
statute
even
applies,
which
we
have
contended
it
does
not.
we
have
never
contended
the
aedpa
abuse
of
the
writ
statute,
if
you
will,
applies,
but
rather,
rule
9,
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
filing
and
has
never
been
rescinded
even
after
enactment
of
aedpa.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
rule
9
of
the
rules
governing
section
2254
cases
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
this
court
through
the
congress
in
1976,
and
i
think
that's
a
point
worth
noting,
that
the
rule
9(b)
was
enacted
some
13
years
after
the
sanders
case
on
which
we
rely,
and
approximately
10
years
after
the
statute
on
which
mr.
slack
relies
to
say
that
they
must
be
read
consistently
with
one
another.
we
suggest
that
the
later
enactment,
which
is
applicable,
that
is,
rule
9(b),
does,
in
fact,
take
precedence
and
does
apply.
in--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--i
was
finished,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
this
case
is
i
would
say
representative,
and
the
only--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--we
have
not
done
any
study.
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i
think
the
farmer
case,
the
history
of
the
farmer
case
upon
which
the
district
court
relied,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
shows
you
just
what
a
problem
it
is.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
do,
and
in
fact,
in
mr.
farmer's--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--in
mr.
farmer's
case
he
pinged-pong...
to
use
the
words
of
the
concurrence
in
harris
v.
reid,
three
times.
the
second--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--it
may,
if
we
can
ever
get
the
district
court
to
hold
the
farmer
hearing
in
that
case,
and
hold
what
is
now
being
called
the
farmer
hearing
in
the
other
cases
on...
in
which
this
has
occurred.
farmer
was
decided--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--yes,
we
did.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
farmer
was
a
capital
case,
and
i
understand
that
on
the
surface
of
it,
it
may
be
seen
that
capital
petitioners
have
more
of
a
reason
to
do
this
very
thing,
and
in
fact
that
was
our
theory
in
farmer.
he
came
back
and
forth
between
the
federal
court
three
times,
the
federal
and
state
courts
three
times,
over
our
objection
the
second
and
third
time,
and
after
the
dismissal
the
third
time,
where
the
judge
allowed
him
to
go
back
yet
again,
we
in
essence
said,
enough
is
enough,
we
are
appealing
the
judge's
abuse
of
discretion
for
not
at
least
considering
our
abuse
of
the
writ
defense,
and
the
ninth
circuit
panel
agreed
that
in
fact
the
court
should
hold
a
hearing
about
that.
it
didn't
necessarily
say
it
should
find
abuse
on
those
facts.
here
we
have
a
noncapital
petitioner,
but
the
expenditure
of
the
state's
resources
to
ping-pong
and
to
respond
to--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--theoretically,
the
defendant
may
well
know
facts
about
the
case
that
the
state
does
not
know
even
well
after
the
case,
such
as
certain
witnesses
have
died,
certain
witnesses
have
disappeared,
evidence
has
been
lost
or
destroyed,
that
if
the
state
were
required
to
refile
the
case
and
try
it
anew,
that
he
would
then
have
a
benefit
that
he
didn't
have
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
would...
in
an
appropriate
case
we
would
assert
that.
i
suppose
its
total
applicability
to
the
serial
petition
coming
back
to
federal
court
would
depend
on
what
the
court,
how
the
court
construes
the
provisions
of
the
aedpa,
which
speak
to
what
a
properly
filed
petition
is.
the
ninth
circuit,
as
an
example,
has
just
ruled
that
if
a
state
court
rules
that
for
some
procedural
default
reason
a
petition
is
belated
in
the
state
courts,
it
will
not
be
considered
a
properly
filed
one,
and
thus
it
will
not
have
tolled
the
time
to
file
a
federal
petition
under
the
aedpa
statute
that
we
now--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--existing.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
no,
we
would
not
agree,
justice
stevens.
we
don't
believe
that
the
rule
has
a
different
meaning
than
the
statute
as
to
what
a
second
or
successive
petition
is,
and--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--second
or
successive,
the
meaning
thereof
does
not
change.
what
may
change
is
how
the
petition
is
handled,
depending
on
what
its
prior
history
is.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
no,
we
do
not.
we...
although
we
relied
exclusively
on
the
affirmative
defense
provided
to
us
by
the
rule.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
it
would
be
within
the
meaning
of
that
if
it
was
presented
in
the
application.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
no,
and--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--yes,
because...
i
assume
your
question
posits
that
the
second
claim
was
not
identified
in
the
first
petition,
thus
it
would
be
new.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
it
was
one
not
presented.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
based
on
the
wording
of
the
statute,
not
to
the
words
second
or
successive,
but
on
how
the
petition
is
handled,
because
he's
not
coming
in
with
an...
in
your
example,
as
i
understand
it,
the
issue
he
had
previously
identified
is
the
one
he
was
coming
back
with
to
apply
(b)(1),
whereas
he
came
back
with
different
issues
in
(b)(2).
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
in
any
instance,
and
i
think
to
try
to
best
answer
your
question,
in
any
instance
where
something
wasn't
identified
in
that
first
petition
and
the
petitioner
comes
back
with
it,
it
is
new,
or
in
the
words
of
the
new
statute,
or
aedpa,
not
presented,
and
thus
then
we
look
to
the
mechanism
as
to
what
the
court
is
to
do
with--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--some
of--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--some
of
this
court's
case
law,
and
much
of
the
case
law
that
the
circuit
courts
have
issued,
says
that.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
perhaps
because
i
didn't...
because
the
question
posits
that
there
are
additional
claims.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
the
essence
of
the
difference
is
that
they
take
the
position,
and
mr.
slack
does,
that
it
requires
a
prior
merits
adjudication,
we
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't.
if
i
mistakenly
or
confusedly
answered
justice
stevens'
questions,
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to.
the
crux
of
the
dispute
is,
we
say
it
doesn't
require
a
prior
merits
decision,
be
it
under
the
rule
9,
or
under
the--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--statute
that
applied,
or
the
new
one.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
because
it
doesn't...
the
statute
doesn't
speak
to,
as
i
understand
it,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
prior
adjudication.
it
merely
says,
presented
in
a
prior
application.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that's
the
statute--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--yes.
it
appears
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
in
appendix
3.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
it
does.
however,
none
of
the
cases--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--there
are
no
cases
from
this
court
of
which
i
am
aware.
of
course,
farmer.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
the
farmer
case,
which
we
cite.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
the
case
law,
i
have
found
no
case
that
ever
says
what
second
or
successive
means.
this
court,
even
as
recently
as
martinez-villareal,
its
opinion
of
two
terms
ago--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--the
sanders
case
upon
which
the
rule
was
fashioned,
the
1963
decision
in
a
2255
case,
in
which
this
court
said,
mr.
sanders'
first
petition
was
dismissed
for
procedural
reasons.
that
is,
it
was
inadequately
pled,
and
while
it
reversed
the
finding
of
abuse,
it
did
allow
the
government,
as
the
case
was
remanded
back,
to
assert
abuse,
and
we
have
cited
that
particular
scenario
in
our
brief
to
this
court,
and
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
it.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
certainly.
it's
the
first
case,
and
i
would
readily
admit
there
is
no
other
case
there,
and
like
so
many
issues
that
get
to
this
court,
this
is
a
particular
case
on
particular
facts,
and
apparently
we
were
the
first
ones
who
had
had
enough
of
serial
mixed
petitions
warranting
the
affirmative
defense
which
we
proffered
successfully
not
only
in
farmer,
but
in
this
case.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
denial
of
the
certificate.
thank
you.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
it
is
indeed
nevada's
position,
consistent
with
the
eighth
circuit
ruling
upon
which
we
rely
and
cite
in
our
brief,
teeterman
v.
benson,
that
the
changes
to
section
2253
regarding
certificates
of
appealability
apply
to
the
appeal
in
this
case,
which
was
initiated
after
the
effective
date,
april
24,
1996.
in
fact,
the
claims
at
issue
which
were
the
subject
of
the
district
court's
dismissal
and
the
circuit
court's
review,
were
filed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
case.
in
teeterman,
the
eighth
circuit,
speaking
to
a
question
that
justice
scalia
just
asked,
noted
that
while
in
lindh
this
court
held
that
the
changes
generally
didn't
apply
to
the
substantive
issues.
it
indicated
that
the
court
could
think
of
no
reason
why
a
new
provision
exclusively
directed
toward
appeal
procedures
would
depend
for
its
effective
date
on
the
filing
of
a
case
in
a
trial
court
instead
of
on
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
or
similar
document
and,
thus,
it
held
in
the
1997
ruling
that
aedpa
does
apply
and
that
the
coa
provisions
apply.
subsequent,
the
hohn
case
also
came
to
this
court
out
of
the
eighth
circuit.
that
was
a
2255
case
in
which
initially
the
petitioner
challenged
the
way
the
federal
statute
had
been
applied
to
him.
at
some
point
in
time
in
the
litigation,
after
he
appealed,
the
government
conceded
that
it
was
not
merely
a
constitutional
or,
excuse
me,
a
statutory
issue,
but,
rather,
a
issue
of
constitutional
dimension
and
ultimately,
as
this
court
knows,
the
hohn
case
ended
up
here
for
its
determination
on
the
limited
issue
regarding
whether
it
could
review
the
denial
of
the
coa.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
yes,
i
am.
i
would
assert
that
the
change
in
language
was
not,
as
mr.
slack
would
assert,
was
nothing
more
than
a
mistake,
or
meant
nothing.
congress
changed
the
term,
federal,
to
the
term,
constitutional
in
the
statute,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
coa
provision
has
application
to
both
state
prisoners
who
bring
their
cases
to
the
district
courts
and
to
federal
prisoners
as
well.
it
frankly
does
what
we
see
congress
having
intended
to
do,
which
is
to
put
limitations
on
the
types
of
issues
that
the
courts
would
have
to
adjudicate.
in
this
case,
the
congress
used
the
word
constitutional,
and
this
court
has
indicated--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--our
position--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--our
position,
consistent
with
that
brief
by
the
several
states
in
this
matter,
is
just
that.
we
would
see
the
evolution
of
the
law--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--it
is
what
i
would
call
a
middle
ground
view.
however,
sometimes
better
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
is
one
consistent
with
what
congress
has
mandated.
we
do
see
that
there
would
be
an
availability
of
remedy
by
way
of
an
extraordinary
writ
proceeding
if
a
ruling
by
a
federal
district
court,
or
even
a
circuit
court
for
that
matter,
on
a
procedural
issue
such
as
exhaustion
or
procedural
bar
were
such
that
this
court
may
not
be
able
to
entertain
it,
or
could
entertain
it.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
would
say
an
extraordinary
writ
would
include
an
original
filing
in
this
court
to
seek
mandamus
or
other
appropriate
extraordinary
remedies.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
don't
think
that
was
congress'
intent
to
transfer
all
those...
many
cases
here,
and
my
response
was
what
sort
of
remedy
could
occur
if,
in
fact,
a
holding
on
a
procedural
matter
was
so
egregious
in
the
district
court,
and
we
assert
that
the
holding
in
this
case
is
a
run
of
the
mil
type
of
holding
and
not
egregious
in
any
way.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
there
are
a
large
number
of
procedural
issues,
that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
it
certainly
would
be
controversial
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
that
is
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
agree
that
there
is
nothing
directly
in
the
history.
i
believe
mr.
pescetta
referred
to
statements
by
then
attorney
general
lundgren,
who,
as
he
accurately
described,
was
a
proponent,
although
not
a
sponsor,
obviously.
while
he
asserted
that
the
court
should
codify,
or
the
congress
should
codify
what
this
court
said
in
barefoot
and
limit
review
to
substantial
federal
rights,
what,
in
fact,
happened
is
the
sponsors,
the
congressmen
and
senators
who
ended
up
agreeing
on
the
legislation,
used
a
different
word,
so
i
think
in
order
to
give
import
to
that
word
you
have
to
look
at
what
it
is
that
can
be
gleaned
from
the
use
of
that
word,
and
it
is
not
procedure,
and
that
is
all
of
what
mr.
slack
had
to
argue
about,
because
the
district
court's
rulings
were
wholly
procedural.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
if
you
read
the
section,
that
being...
or
rule
2(c)(1),
subsection
(b)(ii)
to
mean
that,
while
it
says
you
have
to
make
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
but
that
doesn't
limit
what
you
can
litigate,
then
i
would
agree
with
your
question.
our
position
simply
is,
i
don't
think
you
can
read
where
one
provision
is
included
and
then
say,
but
it
could
include
other
provisions
as
well,
just
by
practice.
in
this
instance,
a
case
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
nichols
case,
nichols
v.
bowersox,
a
first
circuit
case,
it
assumed
congress
had
the
power
to
do
this,
and
we
would
assert
it
certainly
did.
we...
everyone
who
litigates
these
cases
on
a
daily
basis
may
think
that
was
a
really
bad
choice
if
it
indeed
exercised
its
power
to
do
so,
but
where
congress
has
spoken,
as
we
believe
they
have
in
the
coa
provision,
then
it
has
spoken,
and
we
assert
that
in
this
instance,
where
mr.
slack's
petition,
the
five
claims
that
were
really
at
issue,
all
of
which
he
brought
in
well
after
aedpa
became
effective,
all
of
which
we
believed
and
the
district
judge
believed
accordingly
that
were
unexhausted
and
four
of
the
five
were
abusive,
abuse
and
unexhaustion,
simply
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
having
a
meritorious
claim.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
mr.
slack
couched
his
claims
in
terms
of
federal
constitutional
violations,
certainly,
as
many
prisoners
do.
however,
many
prisoners
also
couch
their
claims
in
terms
of
violations
merely
of
state
law,
for
instance,
evidentiary
rulings
that
this
court
had
occasion
to
visit.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
you
are
not
supposed--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--you're
not
supposed
to
be
able
to,
but
it
happens
with
great
regularity
in
state...
or
federal
habeas
proceedings
involving
state
prisoners,
and
they
raise
other
issues
as
well.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
would
argue
a
coa
or
a
cpc,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
well,
the
fourth
circuit
recently
in
gray
v.
netherland
indicated,
for
example,
when
a
prisoner
there
asserted
the
violation
of
a
treaty
right,
that
that
didn't
raise
a
constitutional
right,
so--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--that
is
the
great
majority
of
the
type
of
claims
that
are
filed,
i
would
grant
you
that,
and
i
would
also
indicate
that,
while
it
would
forge
or
require
a
significant
change
to
disallow
rulings
by
the
federal
circuit
courts
on
those
issues,
it
is
not
one
that
is
outside
the
boundaries
of
congress'
power
to
make,
unless
you
just
buy
the
argument,
if
you
will,
that
petitioner
has
asserted
here
that
congress
didn't
mean
anything,
and
they
didn't
change
anything
at
all,
and
some
courts
have.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
don't
necessarily
understand--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--the
solicitor's
argument
to
mean
it
didn't
change
anything.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
don't
agree
wholly
on
that
provision.
we
believe
it
disallows
review
of
procedural
rulings
such
as
the
ones
that
mr.
slack
sought
review
on
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
was
denied
review
on.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
correct.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
there
is,
but
the
very
small
number
of
cases
that
arise
under
the
iada
or
federal
treaties
is
so
small,
frankly,
as
to
be
of
little
import
in
the
universe
of
state
habeas
cases
that
federal
or
state
prisoners
bring
to
the
federal
courthouses.
i
would
say
that
we
recognize
that
even
some
of
the
courts
in
this
country,
the
tenth
circuit,
for
example,
have
indicated
that
it
was
a...
that
the
wording
change
was
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
the
lennox
case,
which
is
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
court
literally
said
that.
however
it...
in
the
same
breadth
it
indicated
that...
it
characterized
changes
to
aedpa
section
2253
as
significant,
but
yet
it
says
it
replicated
the
standard
for
a
certificate.
i
don't
see
how
the
change
can
be
significant
if
it
didn't
change
anything,
and
that
is
our
position
in
the
matter.
while
certainly
the
historical
record
and
the
development
of
a
statute
which
occurred
over
a
long
period
of
time--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--i
understand
that
to
be
their
argument,
and
i
think
it's
a
good
one.
however,
it
does
not
necessarily
seem
to
go
as
far
as
what
the
word
constitutional
means
under
the
statute,
and
that
is,
of
course,
the
question
that
the
court
has
asked
us
to
try
to
speak
to
and,
unfortunately,
there
aren't...
there
isn't
a
lot
of
case
law,
and
the
case
law
that
is
out
there
has
been
cited
by
both
sides,
the
teeterman
case
being
the
one
on
which
we
primarily
rely
from
the
eighth
circuit.
in
briefly
addressing
the
other
question
that
this
court
had
asked
the
parties
to
look
at,
and
that
is
the
change
to
the
actual
statute
itself,
that
is,
the
abuse
of
the
writ
statute,
we
have
submitted
our
assertion
that
the
abuse
of
the
writ
statute
in
this
case,
the
application
of
the
new
statute
frankly
would
make
no
major
difference
in
the
outcome
compared
to
the
old
statute.
and
particularly
the
application
of
rule
9(b)
you
asked
the
question,
justice
stevens,
what
should
happen,
and
the
solicitor
general
answered
that
this
court
could
revert
to
the
first
question
that
was
posed
and
decide
whether
it
was
of
continuing
import.
we
suggest
that
it
is
of
continuing
import,
certainly
in
our
jurisdiction.
there
was
an
assertion
that
there
were
very
few
cases,
or
will
be
very
few
cases.
i
can
tell
you
there
are
many
in
our
jurisdiction,
and
particularly
from
the
state
of
california.
you
may
recall
the
assertion
in
the
brief
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
what
we
colloquially
call
the
parking
lot
procedure,
whereby
they
treat
pre
aedpa
filings
dating
back
to
the
early
1990's
as
actual
filings,
merely
where
prisoners
sought
the
appointment
of
counsel.
those...
many
cases
are
still
pending,
and
frankly
may
not
even
get
back
into
the
federal
district
courts
where
they
have
been,
quote
unquote,
parked,
and
it
is
in
that
context
that
i
say
the
first
question
that
you
all...
that
we
argued
in
the
fall
is
of
continuing
importance.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
well,
in
that
regard,
and
the
state's
last
brief,
the
amicus
brief
authored
by
california,
i
believe
speaks
to
it,
in
that
if
you
note
the
language
of
2253
subsection
(c)(1)(a)
it
requires,
or
it
allows
an
appeal
to
be
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
only
upon
the
final
order
in
a
habeas
case,
and
the
question
then
becomes,
what
is
the
court
reviewing,
or
the
higher
court,
if
you
will,
what
is
it
going
to
review?
in
this
instance,
there
was
a
written
ruling
which
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
which
basically
outlines
what
the
petitioner
said
his
claims
were
at
various
times,
and
the
court's
conclusion
that
they
were
either
unexhausted
or
abusive.
the
lower
court
ruling,
the
order
itself,
the
final
order
is
totally
devoid
of
any
discussion
of
the
merits.
so
then
you
would
have
the
higher,
intermediate
appellate
court
reaching
down
to
try
to
figure
out
what
was
in
terms
of
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claims,
what
they
were.
in
many
instances,
you
don't
have
that.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
think
it's
the
practice.
i
don't
know
if
the
language
makes
it
implicit.
perhaps
the
practice
over
time
has
made
it
so.
i'm
just
not
able
to
answer
that.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
submit
it
on
behalf
of
the
state.
thank
you.
