unknown
speaker
if
you're
right,
mr.
pescetta,
would
it
be
possible
for
a
habeas
corpus
applicant
to
have
his
first
petition
dismissed
because
it
contained
unexhausted
claims
and
then
come
back
the
second
time
and
have
a
bunch
of
new
claims,
as
i
think
your
client
did
here,
and
simply
have
them
considered,
or
perhaps
be
dismissed
as
unexhausted,
and
keep
going
that
way?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
what
this
judge
did.
just...
this
judge
just
dismissed
in
compliance
with
rose
for
exhaustion.
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
go
on
to
speculate
that
the
prisoner
might
come
back
with
new
unexhausted
claims,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
what
does
the
judge
do
when
the
judge
hasn't
speculated
in
advance
about
this
possibility?
unknown
speaker
so
back
the
prisoner
comes
with,
yes,
some
that
are
exhausted
now,
but
adding
on
some
new,
unexhausted
claims.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
light
of
rose
v.
lundy,
what
does
the
judge
do,
faced
with
the
situation
that
happened
here--
unknown
speaker
--with
the
unexhausted
claims?
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
exhausted
claims.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
the
judge
do,
then,
faced
with
this
mixed
petition
with
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims--
unknown
speaker
--when
it
comes
back?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
authority
to
issue
that
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
allowed
by
the
rules,
but
the
problem
i
have
with
the
argument
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
strongest
point
in
your
favor
is
that
we
have
never...
i
think
we
have
never
used
the
term
second
or
successive
as
a
term
to
refer
to
a
case
which
is
brought
when
the
preceding
history
includes
nothing
but
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
so
that
as
a
matter
of
law...
your
strongest
argument
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
assuming
that
congress
uses
the
terms
the
way
this
court
had
been
using
these
terms
of
art,
the
statute
cannot
possibly
mean
that
this
would
be
a
second
or
successive
petition.
if
that
is
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
here
is
a
weak
one,
because
if
ultimately
what
the
court
does
on
the
first
round
is
dismiss
without
prejudice,
it
can
put
all
the
caveats
in
that
it
wants
to,
you
know,
do
it
all
this
time,
only
one
bite
of
the
apple
and
so
on.
when
they
get
back
in
front
of
the
court
again,
it
would
still
not
be
a
second
or
successive
petition.
unknown
speaker
but
you--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
given
us
a
reason,
or
a
source
of
authority
for
the
district
court
to
make
a
conditional
dismissal
like
that.
i
mean,
rule
41
certainly
doesn't
give
the
district
court
authority
to
enter
any
sort
of
an
order
conditioning
dismissal
that
he
pleases,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pescetta,
i
follow
that
with
respect
to
the
first
clause
of
9(b),
where
there
was
a
prior
determination
on
the
merits,
but
the
second
clause
says,
if
new
and
different
grounds,
that
is,
unadjudicated
grounds,
are
alleged,
the
judge
finds
that
the
failure
to
assert
those
grounds
in
a
prior
petition
constituted
an
abuse.
that
seems
to
me
clearly
to
contemplate
grounds
that
were
not
adjudicated,
new
and
different
grounds,
and
then
says,
judge,
you
look
at
the
particular
case,
and
if
you
find
that
the
failure
to
bring
those
up
earlier
constituted
an
abuse,
then
you
toss
it
out.
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
agree
with
me
that
if
you
just
read,
if
new
and
different
grounds
are
alleged,
the
judge
finds
that
the
failure
to
assert
those
earlier
constituted
an
abuse
of...
abuse
of
the
writ.
that
sounds
like
new,
unadjudicated
grounds.
the
judge
finds
in
a
particular
case
that
it's
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
now,
i
thought
that
your
argument
was,
or
could
have
been,
that
here
the
judge
shouldn't
make
such
a
finding
because
all
of
the
new
grounds
were
asserted
the
very
first
time
that
this
petitioner
was
represented
by
counsel.
isn't
it
true
that
those
new
grounds
were
asserted
by
counsel
in
federal
court
the
second
time?
unknown
speaker
so
if
i
read
it
the
way
i...
it
seems
is
the
literal
meaning
of
new
and
different
grounds,
then
you
lose?
you
were
saying
that
this
is
a
res
judicata
rule.
if
something
wasn't
adjudicated--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
don't
understand
why
we
have
to
go
that
far.
i
mean,
i
would
think
your
position
could
be
narrower,
which
is
just
that
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
to
permit
exhaustion
doesn't
count
as
a
first
petition.
i
mean,
that's
all
you
need
to
say
for
your
purposes.
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
go
on
with
this,
has
to
be
adjudicated
on
the
merits
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
why
doesn't
2253
of
aedpa
apply,
that
there
has
to
be
a
certificate
of
appealability
for
you
to
get
here
at
all,
and
there
never
was
in
this
case.
is
that
jurisdictional?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
holding
or
a
dictum?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
holding
or
a
dictum
as
to
all
the
provisions
of
153?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have...
you
had
here
neither
a
cpc
nor
a
coa,
which
is
what
the
prior
law
would
require,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the--
--well--
--under
the
prior
law
before
section
153,
wouldn't
you
have
had
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
appealability?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i
got
the
two
reversed.
and
you
were
denied
that.
unknown
speaker
so
whether
you
rely
on
pre-aedpa
or
post-aedpa,
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
have
what's
necessary
to
get
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying
we
can
review
the
denial
of
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
whereas
presumably
we
cannot
review
post-aedpa
denial
of
a
coa.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
take
a
position
on
that.
all
you
have
to
take
a
position
on
is
that
in
the
pre-aedpa
law
we
could
decide
ourselves
whether
there
should
have
been
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
granted
and
go
ahead
and
review
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but--
--well,
but
that
has
some
shortcoming,
it
seems
to
me.
at
least
one
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
aedpa's
coa
requirements
apply
where
the
petition
was
filed
pre-aedpa
but
dismissed
post-aedpa.
unknown
speaker
well--
--but
hohn
described
what
a
case
was,
and
i
think
that
does
not
help
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
hohn
said
that
a
habeas
petitioner's
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
is
a
separate
case
in
and
of
itself,
and
here
that
would
make
you
post-aedpa,
so
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
a
jurisdictional
barrier
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
aedpa
applies
and
even
if
there's
jurisdiction,
you
have
difficulty
on
the
merits,
don't
you,
since
you
never
alleged
a
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
but
aedpa
has
modified
what
you
can
raise.
you
know,
it
says
denial
by
constitutional
rights,
whereas
pre-aedpa
law
was
a
federal
right,
which
could
be
statutory.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
utterly
disabled
from
reviewing
them
so
long
as
the
underlying
claim
is
not
a
constitutional
one.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
is
thinkable
that
they
would
be
disabled
from
review.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
you
read
it
the
way
you
do.
i
mean,
if
you
can
have
any
federal
constitutional
claim
reviewed,
certainly
the
petitioner
can
have
it
reviewed
if
it's
decided
adversely
to
him,
can
he
not?
unknown
speaker
but
i...
it
may
be
a
very
restrictive
view,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
one-sided,
because
supposing
the
district
court
had
come
out
just
the
opposite
way
and
said
that
the
petition
was
timely
when
in
fact
it
was
a
day
late,
could
the
state
get
that
reviewed?
unknown
speaker
but
again,
you
acknowledge
that
this
situation
exists
so
long
as
the...
whenever
the
underlying
claim
is
not
a
constitutional
claim.
let's
assume
that
the
basis
for
the
habeas
request
is
that
evidence
was
wrongfully
admitted
in
that
shouldn't
have
been
admitted
in,
but
without
violating
the
constitution.
you
acknowledge
that
in
that
situation
exactly
what
you
say
is
unthinkable
would
occur,
that
because
there
is
a
later
procedural
obstacle,
you
cannot
get
the
matter
before
the
habeas
court.
unknown
speaker
other
than
the--
unknown
speaker
--other
than
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
statute,
are
there
any...
in
habeas,
do
they
ever
raise
any
federal
claims
except
constitutional
claims?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
certainly
our
opinions
do
not
refer
to
the
abuse
of
the
writ
cases
as
purely
cases
of
res
judicata.
they
seem
to
indicate
that
it
includes
something
beyond
raising
a
claim
that
was
raised
before.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
certainly
not
what
we
said
in
mccleskey,
when
we
say
a
petitioner
may
abuse
the
writ
by
failing
to
raise
a
claim
through
inexcusable
neglect.
unknown
speaker
our
recent
decisions
confirm
that
petitioner
can
abuse
the
writ
by
raising
a
claim
in
a
subsequent
petition
that
he
could
have
raised
in
his
first,
regardless
of
whether
the
failure
to
raise
it
stems
from
a
deliberate
choice.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
pescetta.
mr.
sarnowski,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski,
did
the
state
raise
the
2253(c)
problem,
the
applicability
of
aedpa
and
the
timeliness,
the
failure
to
file,
get
a
certificate
of
appealability?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
not
dealt
with
by
the
lower
courts?
unknown
speaker
is
it
jurisdictional,
do
you
think,
here
as
well
as
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
some
violation,
or
failure
to
obtain
it
under
aedpa,
if
aedpa
applies,
is
that
then
jurisdictional
here?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
have
been
rather
difficult
for
mr.
pescetta
to
make
that
point
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
had
established
a
rule
that
this
second
petition
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule
was
successive?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
now
about
the
arguments
on
the
second
petition.
unknown
speaker
before
judge
hagan.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski,
suppose
that
the
defendant,
when
he
went
to
the
state
court
to
exhaust,
had
indeed
exhausted
everything,
not
only
the
claims
that
he
put
in
the
federal
habeas
petition,
but
new
and
different
ones
that
weren't
in
the
first
federal
petition,
so
he's
exhausted
everything.
he
comes
back
to
the
federal
court.
is
your
argument
that
that
would
be
okay,
or
do
i
understand
correctly
you
to
say
he
can't
put
in
additional
claims
in
the
federal
petition?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he's
exhausted
them
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
why
we
get
to
affirmative
defenses
if
those
additional
claims
are
simply
out,
even
though
they've
been
exhausted,
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
your
position
was
a
categorical
rule.
if
you
haven't
got
it
in
the
first
petition,
you
can't
have
it
in
the
second.
unknown
speaker
a
state
can
waive
it,
of
course,
but
would
you
explain
to
me
how
your
categorical
rule
is
compatible
with
the
9(b)
language
that
says,
if
new
and
different
grounds
are
alleged,
the
judge
finds.
finds
sounds
like
a
case-specific
assessment
and
not
a
categorical
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
say,
if
he
finds
they're
new
and
different.
he
says,
they
are
new
and
different,
and
the
judge
finds
that
the
failure
to
assert
them
earlier.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
rule
was
they
automatically
do.
if
you
haven't
got
them
in
the
first
petition,
then
there
isn't
a
case-by-case
examination.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
general
rule
that
anything
new
is
categorically
subject
to
dismissal,
but
that
that
is
subject
to
an
exception
under
the
clause
of
9(b)
that
justice
ginsburg
was
referring
to?
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
could
say,
let
me
argue
this
particular
issue,
because
it
was
not
abusive
of
me
to
leave
it
out.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
well,
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
the
odd
thing
with
your
argument
is
that
abuse
is
normally
a
defense
to
a
claim
raised,
and
you're
in
effect
arguing
that
what
the
rule
means
is
that
abuse
in
effect
is
an
affirmative
basis
for
a
petitioner
to
allege
as
a
basis
for
getting
around
the
categorical
rule,
and
that
is...
at
least
starts
with
very
odd
procedural
language
usage.
for
that
reason,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
it's
plausible.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
merely
on
your
rule,
or
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
have
to
plead
the
fact
that
wasn't
included
in
the
first
petition,
and
you
only
get
into
abuse,
on
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
petitioner
says,
but
it's
not
abusive
for
me
to
raise
it.
then
you
get
into
abuse,
and
that
is
anomalous
procedurally.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
some
new
grounds
that
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
the
writ,
such
as
a
new
ground
that
arose
after
the
last
one
was
decided,
a
claim
of
incompetency
to
be
executed,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
is
a
need
to
put
in
that
language
the
judge
finds
that
the
failure
to
assert
those
grounds
in
a
prior
petition
constituted
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
one
explanation
was
that
counsel
finally
got
to
shape
these
pleadings,
and
so
these
claims
appear
as
they
do
in
the
first
petition
that
was
filed
by
counsel.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
the
case
that
this
is
the
first
petition
in
which
the
petitioner
was
represented
by
counsel?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
mean
on
collateral
review.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
you
say,
to
pick
up
what
justice
ginsburg,
i
think,
was
saying,
the
case
is
first
petition,
ground
one
and
ground
two,
one
is
not
exhausted,
two
is.
it
goes
to
the
state
court,
comes
back,
we
add
ground
three.
could
a
judge
say,
in
this
circumstance
there
is
no
abuse
of
the
writ
the
first
time
for
the
reason
that,
a)
the
petitioner
had
no
lawyer
the
first
time,
and
most
of
them
are
pretty
mixed
up,
and
b),
since
i
dismissed
it
immediately
because
it
wasn't
mixed,
no
harm
to
the
court
was
done.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
that.
what
i
said
was,
because
it
was
immediately
sent
out
of
the
federal
court
back
to
the
state
no
harm
to
the
court
was
done.
no
time
was
wasted.
it
was
dismissed,
because
it
was
a
mixed
petition,
and
that's
why
there
was
no
abuse
of
the
writ
the
first
time.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski,
look
at
the
appendix
for
a
moment,
if
you
will,
the
joint
appendix,
page
197,
and
it's
before
a
two-judge
motions
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
it
simply
says
the
request
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
denied.
is
that
the
only
opinion
we
have
from
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
know
the
reason
for
the
ninth
circuit's
denial
of
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
that
focuses
on
the
language
of
the
statute
for
a
minute?
we
are
talking,
are
we
not,
about
2244(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
and
(b)(1)
says,
a
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
application
under
2254
that
was
presented
in
a
prior
application
shall
be
dismissed,
and
i
have
two
questions.
the
first
question
is,
if
the
first
petition
was
not
exhausted,
presented
three
claims,
1,
2,
and
3,
and
then
it
was
exhausted,
and
it
came
back
and
presented
just
those
three
claims,
would
that
be
a
second
or
successive
petition
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(1)
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not.
now,
(b)(2)
has
similar
language,
and
then
talks
about
the
addition
of
new
claims,
and
it
says,
it
shall
be
dismissed,
a
second...
a
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive
habeas
petition
that
was
not
presented
in
a
prior
application
shall
be
dismissed
unless.
now,
is
that
also
not
a
second
or
successive
if
there
were
three
claims
in
the
first
that
were
not
exhausted,
then
three
new
claims
were
added
when
it
comes
back.
is
that
second
or
successive,
or
is
it
just
like
the
first,
it
was
not
second
or
successive
because
the
first
one
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust?
unknown
speaker
i'm
referring
to
2244,
whether
the
claim...
my
question
really
is
whether
the
word
second
or
successive
habeas
application
have
the
same
meaning
in
(b)(1)
as
in
(b)(2).
unknown
speaker
then
if
it's
not
a
second
or
successive
under
(b)(1)
in
my
first
example,
it's
also
not
a
second
or
successive
in
the
second.
unknown
speaker
so
if
it's
not
a
second
or
successive
in
this
case
it
should
not
be
dismissed
under
(b)(2).
unknown
speaker
this
is
rule
9
of
what?
where--
unknown
speaker
--adopted
by?
unknown
speaker
finish
it.
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
get
away
from
the
language
of
the
rule
for
a
minute.
i'll
make
the
assumption
that
in
fact
we
could
go
either
way
on
this
case.
that
may
or
may
not
be
true,
but
assume
it
for
the
sake
of
argument.
what
kind
of
a
real
world
problem
is
this?
are,
in
fact,
petitions
coming
back
repeatedly
in
significant
numbers
following
dismissals
without
prejudice
for
exhaustion,
with
a
new
parcel
of
still
unexhausted,
of
new
unexhausted
claims,
or
is
this
case
more
or
less
a
sport?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any...
has
anybody
does
a
study
of
this,
or
are
there
any
figures
to
indicate
that
this
is
a
serious
problem?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
such
a
problem,
why
doesn't
the
state
just
have
this
rule
against
successive
petitions?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that
solve
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
why
doesn't...
justice
kennedy
has
asked
you,
why
doesn't
the
state
rule
act
as
a
bar
to
be
applied
in
the
federal
claim?
unknown
speaker
did
you
raise
it
as
a
bar
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
incentive?
you
said
this
is
a
recurrent
problem.
i
can
see
in
a
death
case
spinning
out
the
date
of
execution,
but
in
a
nondeath
case,
you
can
never
get
the
attention
of
the
federal
court.
you
cannot
engage
the
federal
court
until
you've
exhausted.
lundy
makes
that
absolutely
clear.
so
what
incentive
would
a
defendant
have
for
this
kind
of,
what
you
call
ping-pong?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's--
--what
about
the
statute
of
limitations
under
aedpa?
there's
a
rather
short
statute
of
limitations.
wouldn't
that
be
of
some
assistance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
go
back
to
my
question
for
a
minute.
as
i
understand
it,
you're
relying
primarily
on
rule
9(b),
but
the
question
that
the
court
posed
in
the
order
granting
certiorari
related
only
to
section
2254.
you're
aware
of
that.
page
198
of
the
transcript.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
would
agree
that
if
we
confined
our
attention
to
the
question
raised
in
that...
in
our
order,
the
2254,
this
is
not
a
second
or
successive
within
the
meaning
of
2254,
so
you
would
agree
with
your
opponent's
answer
to
the
question
presented
by
the
court.
unknown
speaker
but
in
answer
to
my
questions
earlier,
you
said
that
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
was
not
a
second
or
successive
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2),
and
you
said
no,
that's
true,
but
that's
why
they
relied
on
aedpa
and
you
didn't,
and
you're
relying
on
9(b).
unknown
speaker
well,
but
do
you
agree
that
this
is
not
a
second
or
successive
petition
within
the
meaning
of
2244(b)(2)?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
can
i
go
back
to
my
example
under
(b)(1).
if
it
were
just
the
same
claims
as
in
the
state
petition,
which
was
unexhausted
and
refiled,
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
it
would
not
be
second
or
successive
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(1).
am
i
wrong
on
that?
unknown
speaker
here's
my
hypothetical.
let's
be
perfectly
clear
about
it.
you
have...
the
petitioner
has
one
claim.
he
files
in
federal
court,
and
the
district
court
says,
you
haven't
exhausted,
i'll
dismiss
without
prejudice.
he
goes
back
and
exhausts.
now
he
comes
back.
is
that
a
second
or
successive
petition
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(1)?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now
he
is...
now
this...
i
change
my
example.
he
takes
the
first
petition
with
one
claim,
goes
back
and
exhausts
that,
adds
a
second
claim
and
comes
back.
is
that
a
second
or
successive
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(2)?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
new.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
new
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive,
but
you
would
give
a
different
meaning
to
the
words
second
or
successive
in
(b)(1)
than
(b)(2).
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's...
the
(b)(2)
as
i
read
it,
it
says
a
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive
that
was
not
presented
in
a
prior
application.
that
deals
with
it.
but
you're
saying
that
one
is
second
or
success...
my
second
example
is
second
or
successive,
but
the
first
one
is
not.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it...
isn't
the
reason
that
it's
not
second
or
successive
under
one
because
there
was
no
prior
adjudication
of
anything
on
the
merits
under
the
original
petition?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
reason
that
you
had,
that
you
gave
justice
stevens
the
answer
you
did
on
(1)?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
why
don't
you
have
to
give
him
the
same
answer
under
(2)?
nothing...
on
his
second
hypothetical
under
(2),
nothing
has
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
yes,
there
are
additional
claims,
but
if
second
and
successive
refers
to
the
fact
or
not
of
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
a
prior
petition,
then
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
have
to
give
him
the
same
answer
under
(2)
that
you
did
under
(1).
unknown
speaker
then
why
doesn't
it
under
(b)(1)?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
it
under
(b)(1)?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
corresponding
language
of
aedpa,
supposing
that
we
decide
that
aedpa
does
apply
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
aedpa
language?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski,
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
the
words
second
or
successive
application
is
not
a
phrase
newly
coined
in
aedpa,
but
rather
refers
to
a
body
of
case
law
concerning
what
is
second
or
successive.
unknown
speaker
and
had
re...
are
there
any
cases
that
dismissed
the
return
of
a
petitioner
from
exhausting
his
claims,
and
after
having
been
told
to
do
that,
are
there
any
cases
that
have
dismissed
such
a
reapplication
as
a
second
or
successive
habeas?
unknown
speaker
of
any
court.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
only
way
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question
is
by
saying
that
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
application
is
a
term
of
art,
and
that
it
may...
and
that
it
does
not
include
coming
back
a
second
time
after
you've
been
dismissed
the
first
time
and
told
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
exhaust
and
then
come
back.
it's
the
only
way
you're
going
to
be
able
to
do
it,
so
does
the
case
law
support
you
on
that?
unknown
speaker
going
the
other
way,
have
you
found
any
case...
i
refer
specifically
to
justice
kennedy's
opinion,
mccleskey
and
all
the
cases
he
cites,
in
which
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
has
been
applied
when
there
has
not
been
a
prior
dismissal
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
farmer
case
from
the
ninth
circuit?
that
tends
to
support
your--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
sarnowski.
mr.
pescetta,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
that
would
support
you
if
there
were
no
other
claims
tacked
on
here
to
the
exhausted
claim.
unknown
speaker
unless
second
or
successive
is
a
term
of
art
which
does
not
include
bringing
back
a
petition
previously
dismissed
without
prejudice
with
the
instruction
to
exhaust
the
state
remedies.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
real
distinction
is,
the
question
of
what
do
you
identify
as
the
first?
there
can't
be
a
second
unless
there's
a
first,
and
if
you
dismiss
it
for
not...
exhaustion,
and
you
don't
add
any
new
claims,
it
wasn't
a
first.
unknown
speaker
if
you
add
a
new
claim,
it
suddenly
became
a
first.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
aedpa
froze
the
concept
of
a
second
or
a
successive
petition,
so
that
if
something
came
to
our
attention
that
we
regarded
as
in
the
same
ball
park,
we
could
not
decide
that
it
was?
unknown
speaker
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
please
proceed,
mr.
pescetta.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
pescetta,
i
do
have
a
problem
right
off
the
bat
with
the
fact
that
in
a
case
here
called
hohn,
h
o
h
n,
we
said
that
a
request
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
is
a
case
itself
and,
if
that's
correct,
it
looks
to
me
like
your
client's
case,
insofar
as
we
treat
it
as
a
certificate
of
appealability,
anyway,
was
filed
after
what
we
call
aedpa's
effective
date,
and
is
governed
by
section
2253(c).
unknown
speaker
well,
i
certainly
thought
that's
what
it
said,
i
have
to
tell
you,
so
if
i
think
that,
then
what
do
we
do?
unknown
speaker
so
if
i'm
correct
about
what
i
think
hohn
stood
for,
you'd
say
it
was
wrong
and
we
should
get
rid
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
totally...
you
know,
if
you
simply
don't
file
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
the
case
is
over.
if
you
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
a
brand
new
case
starts
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
hohn
came
considerably
after
that.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
i
think...
i
agree
with
justice
o'connor.
a
fair
reading
of
hohn
is
that
this
is
a
new
case.
unknown
speaker
it
held
that
it
was
a
case.
it
didn't
hold
that
it
was
a
new
case.
unknown
speaker
and
in
order
to
make
your
opponent's
point
here,
it
would
have
to
be
a
new
case.
unknown
speaker
what
was
filed
here
was
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
i
guess,
not
a
certificate
of
appealability.
unknown
speaker
well,
haven't
a
number
of
courts
of
appeal
treated
those
two
things
just
interchangeably?
they've
treated
certificates
of
probable
cause
as
certificates
of
appealability.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
lindh
held
was
essentially
that
there
is
no
retroactivity
provision
in
section
153,
and
therefore
the
normal
rules
of
nonretroactivity
apply,
and
the
normal
rules
of
nonretroactivity
for
a
statute
that
sets
forth
the
substantive
requirements
for
habeas
would
not
apply
that
statute
to
any
cases
that
were
filed
already
when
the
statute
was
enacted.
but
the
normal
rules
of
retroactivity
do
not
apply
uniformly
to
every
matter
governed
by
a
statute.
i
mean,
you
might
have
in
the
same
statute
the
alteration
of
the
substantive
requirements
for
a
crime,
okay,
the
alterations
of
the
requirements
for
filing
a
lawsuit,
and
the
alteration
of
evidentiary
requirements
in
the
course
of
a
trial.
now,
what
would
constitute
a
retroactive
application
of
each
one
of
those
three
is
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
and
what
lindh
involved
was
the
substantive
requirements
for
habeas,
and
it
said
this
would
be
retroactive
if
you
applied
the
new
substantive
requirements
to
a
case
already
filed.
but
it's
an
entirely
different
question
as
to
whether
requirements
concerning
the
requirements
for
appeal
are
being
applied
retroactively
so
long
as
you
apply
them
to
cases
that
are
not
yet
on
appeal,
and
i
think
that's
what's
going
on
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
not
at
all
contrary
to
lindh
to
say
that
the
requirements
for
appealing
are
governed
by
the
new
law.
unknown
speaker
they
say
generally.
would
you
say
generally
do
not
apply?
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
the
reason
it
said
generally
was
because
some
of
those
provisions
do
not
deal
with
the
initial
substantive
requirements
for
getting
relief,
but
deal
to
such
matters
as
what
are
the
conditions
for
appeal.
that's
why
it
said
generally.
unknown
speaker
they
certainly
don't
apply
retroactively,
but
what
constitutes
a
retroactive
application
of
them
is
another
question,
and
i
don't
consider
it
a
retroactive
application
of
them
to
say
that
they
apply
to
all
cases
that
seek
an
appeal
after
the
enactment
insofar
as
their
provisions
governing
appeals
are
concerned.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought,
mr.
pescetta,
that
you
said
in
the
second
part
of
your
argument,
this
is
a
nice,
academic
discussion.
it
really
doesn't
matter,
because
for
the
issue
that's
before
this
court,
whether
it's
a
coa
or
whether
it's
a
cpc,
that
what
you
have
to
satisfy
is
the
same.
that
is,
since
you're
not
relying...
you're
not
saying
the
state
court
misapplied
any
federal
statute.
you're
claiming
a
constitutional
right,
as
is
usual
in
habeas
cases,
so
i
thought
you
were
saying
in
the
second
part
of
your
argument
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying,
then,
that
when
the
aedpa
says
constitutional
right
it
really
means
any
sort
of
a
right
claimed
under
a
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
strange
way
of
expressing
it.
unknown
speaker
what
was
being
discussed
in
mccleskey
was
a
constitutional
right,
so
it
makes
perfectly
good
sense
there
to
talk
about...
that
language
wasn't
intended
to
cover
the
whole
scope
of
habeas.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
an
opinion
where
the
habeas
claim
is
based
on
a
constitutional
right,
it
makes
perfectly
good
sense
to
say,
here
we
have
a
constitutional
claim
made
under
the
habeas
statute,
but
when
congress
says
it's
not
talking
about
any
particular
claim
that's
being
raised
in
a
case,
such
as
we
do,
when
it
says
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
i
think
it's
certainly
a
very
plausible
inference
it
means
that
and
nothing
more.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
the
provision
that
is
dealing
with
what
can
be
raised.
unknown
speaker
isn't
your
underlying
claim
here
one
of
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
think
there
is
a
substantial
claim?
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't
you
fall
within
it?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
do
you
have
even
any
right...
as
far
as
i
can
see,
what
he's
complaining
about
in
the
state
criminal
process
is
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
he's
not
raising
any
federal
statute.
he's
not
raising
any
treaty.
unknown
speaker
that's
interesting,
and
you
would
apply
that
consistently?
you
would
always
look
at
the
underlying
claim,
so
that
even
if
the
underlying
claim...
if
the
underlying
claim
was
statutory,
or
based
upon
a
treaty,
and
then
in
the
disposition
of
that
claim
the
procedural
right
that
was
denied
was
so
fundamental
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
deny
that
procedural
right,
and
then
the
violation
of
that
procedural
right
is
sought
to
be
appealed
on
habeas,
you
would
dismiss
it
because
the
underlying
claim,
after
all,
is
not
a
constitutional
claim.
that's
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you'd
do
that.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
theory
is.
unknown
speaker
whether
your
theory
is
that
you
always
look
to
the
underlying
claim,
or
the
defeat
of
the
underlying
claim,
or
the
procedural
claim
is
a...
arises
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your...
the
point
you
were
making
is,
you
look
to
see
what
you
are
complaining
about
in
the
state
criminal
process,
not
when
you
get
to
the
district
court
complaining
on
habeas.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you're
in
the
state,
and
whether
you
say
it
was
a
procedural
violation
or
a
substantive
violation,
i...
as
long
as
the
focus
of
2253(c)
is
on
the
state
criminal
process,
what
went
wrong
there,
then
all
you
have
is
constitutional
objectives.
unknown
speaker
codify
what?
unknown
speaker
barefoot.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
pescetta.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
on
what
theory?
on
the
theory
that
it's
a
new
case,
or
on
the
theory
that
lindh
doesn't
cover
that?
unknown
speaker
but
why?
why?
that
is...
i
mean,
i
read
your
brief.
it's
very
logical.
it's
very
good.
the
question
in
my
mind
is,
why
make
this
so
complicated?
i
mean,
if
you're
right,
there
are
very
few
lawyers
in
the
country
who
will
understand
it,
let
alone
the
judges
and
all
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
who
knows
what
they've
decided,
and
the
certificate
isn't
the
most...
the
name
on
the
certificate,
whether
it's
cpc
or
some
other
name,
isn't
so
important,
and
all
of
a
sudden
appeals
are
generated,
and
the
law's
about
the
same
anyway,
and
so
why
isn't
the
simplest
thing
just
to
say,
this
is
part
of
the
case?
it
means
new
cases,
and
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
what
harm
would
be
done?
unknown
speaker
and
so
what
we've
done
is
introduced
a
little
curlicue
and
told
all
the
lawyers,
by
the
way,
it's
when
you
file
the
petition
in
the
district
court,
but
for
the
cpc,
and
eventually
i
guess
that
word
would
get
out.
but
why?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
after
all,
case
can
mean
different
things
in
a
different
context.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
transitional
rule
anyway.
unknown
speaker
it's
perfectly
clear
that
eventually
aedpa
will
apply
to
all
appeals.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
didn't
we...
no,
please.
didn't
we
put
it...
i
just
took
a
quick
look
at
hohn,
the
principal
opinion
in
hohn,
and
didn't
we
speak
of
case
there
in
more
or
less
the
following
terms
we
said
that
the
denial
of
this
threshold
condition
does
not
prevent
a
case
from
being
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
in
effect...
we
did
not
say
in
hohn
that
the
coa
request
was
itself
a
separate
case,
as...
and
justice
scalia
suggested
a
moment
ago,
we
didn't
say
it
was
something
new,
and
in
fact
elsewhere
we
spoke
of
the,
in
essence
the
indivisibility
of
the
merits
of
the
case
from
the
coa,
so
if
we
read
hohn
not
as
indicating
that
a
coa
is
a
new
and
separate
proceeding,
why
do
we
have
to
be
as
complicated
as
you
would
have
us
be?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
just
do
that
directly,
without...
i
frankly
find
it
very
strange
to
regard
this
as
a
separate
case.
i
think
that's
just
contrary
to
normal
usage.
why
don't
you
simply
say
that
all
that
lindh
held
was
that
the
substantive
requirements
are
governed
by
a
nonretroactive
principle,
and
what
nonretroactivity
means
for
the
substantive
requirements
is
that
you
apply
them
to
all
cases.
you
do
not
apply
the
new
requirements
to
all
cases
that
were
already
filed.
but
what
nonretroactivity
means
for
new
appellate
procedures
is
that
you
do
not
apply
them
to
any
cases
that
have
not...
that
have
already
been
appealed.
unknown
speaker
and
that
gets...
it
gets
you
to
the
same
point
without
having
to
use
the...
it
seems
to
me
a
strange
use
of
what's
a
case.
unknown
speaker
you
probably
ought
to
say
something
about
the
merits--
unknown
speaker
--before
you
have
to
sit
down.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you're
telling
me
what
we
could
do.
i'm
just
wondering
what
you
think
we
should
do.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
sarnowski.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski,
assuming
aedpa
applies,
are
you
going
to
talk
about
whether
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
standard
that
the
solicitor
general
would
ask
us
to
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
that's
the
underlying
claim,
and
if
the
problem
is
where
the
petitioner
makes
a
substantial
showing
that
the
district
court
erred
on
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
it's
second
or
successive,
you
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
never
address
that
problem--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
the
law
then
would
evolve
in
district
court,
without
any
appellate
review
on
legal
questions
such
as
exhaustion
or
procedural
default
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that's
unfortunate
and
troublesome,
i
have
to
tell
you,
and
i
wonder
if
the
solicitor
general's
position
wouldn't
be
the
better
view
here.
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
an
extraordinary
writ
would
you
envision,
mr.
sarnowski?
unknown
speaker
well,
quite
apart
from
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute,
one
would
hope
it's
not
likely
that
congress
intended
to
transfer
from
what
would
otherwise
be
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
direct
review
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
but
my
experience...
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
it
would
be
relevant...
it
seems
to
me
the
vast
percentage,
maybe
the
overwhelming
percentage
of
cases
on
appeal
in
habeas
proceedings
do
have
to
do
with
procedural
issues,
whether
there
was
an
adequate
state
ground,
whether
there's
a
basis
for
new
evidence
and
therefore
you're
excused
from
not
raising
the
claim
before,
things
like
that,
and
your
position
is
that
all
those,
you
can't
get
a
coa
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
right
in
thinking
that's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
this
have
been
the
most
controversial
provision
in
the
whole
reform
package,
if
that
were
so?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
thinking
of
controversy
by
this...
i'm
saying
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
history
that
suggested
that
this
was
the
major
change
in
the
law,
but
the
way
you're
reading
it,
it
sounds
as
if
it
would
be
an
enormous
change.
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
you
can
only
appeal
a
constitutional
right.
what
it
says
is,
you
cannot
issue
a
coa.
you
can
issue
a
coa
only
if
there
is
a
substantial
claim.
now,
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
their
being
there
in
the
case
that
you're
trying
to
appeal
a
substantial
claim.
it
doesn't
say
that
has
to
exhaust
the
grounds
on
which
you
are
appealing.
unknown
speaker
but
the
claims
that
he
brought
were
constitutional
claims,
so
one
could
surely
read
this
subsection
(c)
of
section
2253
to
mean
that
even
if
you
could
surmount
the
procedural
hurdle
of
adequate,
independent
state
grounds,
still
you
don't
get
a
certificate
of
appealability
unless
you
show
that
you
had
made
a
claim
about
what
went
on
in
the
state
criminal
proceedings
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
so
that
seems
to
me
the
most
logical
reading
of
this
provision,
that
it's
talking
about
what
is
your
basic
habeas
claim.
why
am
i
being
detained
unlawfully?
because
there
was
a
constitutional
flaw
in
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
but
that
you
didn't
need...
you
didn't
need
any
new
legislation
to
toss
that
out.
habeas,
you
can't
complain
about
a
violation
of
purely
state
law.
unknown
speaker
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
would
such
cases
merit
a
cpc?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
that
those
cases
were
problematic
for
the
federal
courts
before
or
now.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
i
don't
know
why
that
differs
from
what
i
was
saying,
that
if
this...
except
that
under
the
old
law
you
could
raise
something
under
a
treaty
or
a
federal
statute,
and
you
brought
up
a
rare
case,
where
the
underlying
claim
would
be
a
treaty
or
a
statute,
but
mostly
these
are
complaints
about
something
that
violated
your
constitutional
right,
and
it's
usually
some
procedural
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
why
isn't
that
a
sensible
reading
of
2255?
unknown
speaker
53.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't...
but
you
seem
to
be
distancing
yourself
from
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
and
i
want
to
know
first,
are
you,
or
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
they
say
constitutional
right,
certainly
i
take
it
it
would
no
longer
be
available
to
raise
a
claim
under
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
act,
that
the
state
court
had
violated
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
could
have
been
raised
before.
unknown
speaker
and...
so
that
there
is
some
change
in
that
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
i
think,
recognizes
a
change,
that
in
order
to
get
a
certificate
of
whatever
it
is
now,
coa,
you
would
not
be
able
to
get
it
simply
by
showing
that
there
was
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
procedural
right
under
the
habeas
statute.
it
was...
something
was
called
second
and
successive,
and
it
wasn't.
you
would
also
have
to
show
that
your
underlying
claim
was
substantial,
and
i
don't
think
you
had
to
do
that
before.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarnowski,
can
i
ask
you
about
your
interpretation
of
2253?
like
justice
o'connor,
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
the
underlying...
if
the
underlying
claim
is
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
it
may
suffice.
it
seems
to
me
the
strongest
argument
against
that,
and
i
haven't
heard
you
assert
it...
maybe
i
should
have
asked
this
question
of
the
solicitor
general,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
strongest
argument
against
it
is,
if
you
do
look
to
the
underlying
claim
and
say,
has
there
been
a
substantial
showing
in
the
underlying
claim
that
a
constitutional
right
was
denied,
it
seems
to
me
then,
even
if
the
procedural
ground
from
which
appeal
is
immediately
sought
is
entirely
clear,
even
though
there's
not
much
of
a
doubt
about
the
correctness
of
the
procedural
ruling,
you
would
have
to...
you
would
have
to
allow
appeal.
i
don't
see...
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
how
the
solicitor
general
gets
the
second
half
of
his
interpretation
of
2253(c)(2).
the
first
half
he
says
is
that
you
look
to
see
whether
the
underlying
claim
is
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
but,
he
says,
if
the
procedural
ruling
was,
you
know,
rolling
off
a
log,
there's
no
doubt
about
its
correctness,
you
don't
get
a
certificate
of
appealability.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
impose
that
latter
condition.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess...
could
you
argue
that
just
the
introductory
phrase
of
(c)(1),
unless
a
circuit
justice
or
judge
issued
a
certificate
of
appealability
an
appeal
may
not
be
taken,
and
maybe
implicit
in
that
is
that
they
wouldn't
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability
unless
they
thought
that
the
ruling
was...
you
know,
was
close?
could
you
say
it's
implicit
in
that
language?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
answer?
oh,
yes.
your
answer
is
right
the
second
time,
wrong
the
first
time.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
sarnowski.
mr.
pescetta,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
that
if
the
procedural
ruling
itself
is
clearly
correct,
you
don't
get
a
coa?
