mr.
michael
pescetta
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
this
case
also
arises
in
the
thicket
of
habeas
proceedings,
i
think
the
question
that
this
court
posed
on
certiorari
can
be
answered
by
answering
two
common-sense
questions.
one
is,
can
we
have
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
that
is,
a
dismissal
with
some
prejudice?
two,
can
we
apply
a
res
judicata
rule
when
there
has
been
no
previous
adjudication
in
the
matter?
can
we
have
res
judicata
without
judicata?
i
submit
that
the
common-sense
answers
to
both
of
those
questions
are
no,
we
can't,
and
that
those
answers
control
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
pescetta
in
theory,
yes,
your
honor,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefing,
there
are
other
ways
to
control
that
problem
if
it
becomes
a
problem
in
the
case.
the
conditional--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
conditional
dismissal
order
or
practice
that
can
be
used
under
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
can
control
that
if
a
petitioner...
if
a
federal
district
judge
believes
that
there
is
a
problem
with
what
the
state
refers
to
in
this
case
as
the
ping-pong
effect
of
going
back
and
forth
from
state
to
federal
court
by
filing
repeated
unexhausted
petitions.
that
can
be
controlled
by
a
district
court
saying,
this
is
your
last
chance.
we're
going
to
issue
an
order
that
dismisses
you
without
prejudice
but,
as
a
condition
of
that
order,
when
you
come
back
we
will
entertain
only
your
exhausted
claims.
that
is
a
technique
that
has
been
used
successfully
in
capital
cases
in
the
district
of
nevada--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
that
may
not
occur.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--but
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
a
decision
that
the
judge
can
make
in
the
district
judge's
discretion
when
the
district
judge
perceives
that
that
is
a
problem.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
think--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
think
the
district
judge
in
this
case
had
followed
what
we
believe
to
be
the
law,
that
is
that
the
prior
dismissal
without
prejudice
does
not
make
this
petition
a
second
or
successive
petition.
mr.
michael
pescetta
as
to
any
claims,
your
honor,
because
our
position
is--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
judge--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
judge
can
issue
an
order
dismissing
the
case
without
prejudice,
but
directing
that
this
is
the
petitioner's
last
opportunity
to
exhaust,
and
that
when
he
returns
to
federal
court,
the
federal
court
will
only
address
unexhausted
claims,
and
that
order
could
be
enforced
under
rule
41(b).
mr.
michael
pescetta
rule
41(a).
a
conditional
dismissal
without
prejudice
is
clearly
allowed
by
the
federal
rules,
and
in
fact--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
then
it
would
be
subject
to
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
under
rule
41(b)
by
the
court
enforcing
its
previous
order
in
that
case--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--and
that's
the
distinction...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
certainly
it's...
the
power
is
not
unlimited,
but
a
reasonable
condition
on
an
order
of
dismissal
is
always
upheld.
now,
the
concern
that
we
are
faced
here
is
that
there
are
two
parallel
tracks
of
jurisprudence.
one
is
rule
9(b),
the
second
2244(b),
which
enact
what
this
court
has
consistently
and
uniformly
referred
to
as
a
res
judicata
rule.
this
was
clearly
stated
in
the
congressional
materials
and
reports
in
the
enactment
in
1966
of
section
2244.
it
was
emphasized--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
part
of
the
res
judicata
component
of
the
rule.
our
position
is
that
a
second
or
a
successive
petition
in
the
first
sentence
of
rule
9(b)
means
what
this
court
has
always
taken
it
to
mean.
that
is,
a
petition
that's
filed
after
a
previous
petition
has
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
some
form.
the
remainder
of
that
rule
referred
to
different
kinds
of
situations
that
can
arise
in
a
second
or
a
successive
petition,
and
if
you
look
at
the
parallel
provisions
in
section
2244(b)
and
former
section
2244(b),
it
doesn't
use
the
term,
second
or
successive
petition.
it
says,
when
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
merits...
and
this
is
in
page
2
of
our
brief,
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
when,
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
merits
of
a
material
factual
issue,
or
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
an
issue
of
law,
a
person
in
custody
is...
pursuant
to
a
judgment
of
a
state
court
has
been
denied
by
a
court
of
the
united
states.
that
is
boiled
down,
i
submit,
in
rule
9(b)
into
a
second
or
a
successive
petition.
the
rest
of
2244(b)
tracks
closely
the
rest
of
rule
9(b),
so
i
think
those
rules
have
to
be
harmonized.
now,
i
think
we
also--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
majority
of
them,
yes,
but
our
position
is
that
that
second
clause
that
your
honor
just
read
is
limited
by
the
beginning
of
the
rule
which
narrows
its
application
to
a
second
or
successive
petition,
so
that
you
don't
have
any
application
of
rule
9(b)
unless--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--it's
a
res
judicata
rule
which
covers
both
adjudicated
and
unadjudicated
claims
as
long
as
there
is
a
previous
petition
that
was
decided
on
the
merits.
that's
what
res
judicata
is,
of
course,
all
about.
mr.
michael
pescetta
you've
said
it
better
than
i,
your
honor,
and
i
can
only
agree
with
you.
the
problem
is--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
submit,
your
honor,
the
aedpa
does
not
apply.
mr.
michael
pescetta
because
under
lindh
v.
murphy,
this
court
held
that
the
chapter
153
amendments
that
were
enacted
by
aedpa
do
not
apply
retroactively.
those
provisions
of
section
2253,
and
of
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
22,
are
part
of
the
chapter
153
amendments
to...
that
were
enacted
by
aedpa.
therefore,
if
this
court
adheres
to
lindh,
in
which
it
said
the
provisions
of
that
chapter
do
not
apply
retroactively,
there's
no
question
that
mr.
slack's
petition
was
filed
before
aedpa
was
enacted--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--and
therefore
it
doesn't
apply.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
believe
that
the...
i
believe
that
it
would
be
dictum
outside
the
particular
facts
of
that
case.
nonetheless,
i
think
the
same
policies
that
apply,
that
were
applied
in
lindh
by
this
court,
apply
here.
when
the
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
a
certain
kind
of
review,
it
did
so.
it
said
so
explicitly.
there
is
nothing
in
aedpa
that
remotely
suggests
the
kind
of
radical
change
that
the
amici
suggest
was
worked
by
section
2253.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes.
we
applied
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
it
was
denied
by
the
trial
court,
it
was
denied
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
we
are
here
under
hohn
v.
united
states.
mr.
michael
pescetta
no,
your
honor.
that...
the
prior
law,
pre-aedpa,
called
it
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
for
appeal.
mr.
michael
pescetta
and
we
were
denied
that,
and
we
were
denied
that
sua
sponte
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
pescetta
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
we
are
here
under
hohn
v.
united
states.
mr.
michael
pescetta
that's
what
i
understand
hohn
to
mean.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
the
difficulty
there,
your
honor,
is
it
doesn't
take
hohn
into
consideration,
i
don't
think,
because
it
is
part
of
the
section
153
amendments,
and
that's
what
gets
us
here.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
disagree,
your
honor.
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
for
these
purposes,
i
believe,
no
different
from
an
application
for
a
certificate
or
probable
cause.
in
detail
it
may
be
different.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
think,
your
honor,
having
applied,
properly
applied,
we
believe,
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
the
district
court,
and
having
been
denied
it,
the
same
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
whether
it
is
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
or
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability,
and
the
seventh
circuit
has
held
that
the
fact
that
you
call
it
the
wrong
thing
doesn't
affect
the
court's
jurisdiction,
that
invests
the
court
of
appeals
with
jurisdiction
in
the
same
way
under
aedpa
that
it
did
under
pre-aedpa
law.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
the
underlying
constitutional
violations
are
the
claims
of
the
petition
that
are
the
denials
of
the
constitutional
right.
there
is
no
case
that
has
ever
suggested
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
that
a
procedural
issue
that
covers
an
underlying
substantive
claim
can't
be
addressed
under
a
certificate
of
appealability
or
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
that
language,
denial
of
a
federal
right,
or,
under
aedpa,
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
clearly
refer
to
the
underlying
claim.
i
mean,
in
barefoot
v.
estelle,
where
some
of
this
language
came
from
originally,
the
question
at
issue
there
was
a
stay,
and
the
standard
for
a
stay
was
the
substantiality
of
the
underlying
claim
that
entitles
you
to
the
stay.
mr.
michael
pescetta
but
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
still
refers
to
the
underlying
claim.
congress
could
have
narrowed
the
class
of
claims
to
constitutional
claims
that
it
would
allow
to
be
reviewed
on
the
merits,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
procedural
questions
that
are
involved
in
determination
of
those
issues
could
never
be
reached
by
any
appellate
court.
what
that
would
mean
is
that
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
would
be
utterly
powerless
to
police
the
activities
of
the
district
courts
in
habeas
cases
on
procedural
issues,
and
the
only
case
that
has
addressed
an
argument
like
that
that
was
cited
by
amici
is
trevino
v.
johnson
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
and
that
court
said
no,
that's
not
right,
it
refers
to
the
underlying
quality
of
the
claim.
mr.
michael
pescetta
but
that's
a--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
don't
think
that
would
have
happened
in
this
way,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
the
mechanism
for
reviewing
a
second
or
successive
petition
under
the
aedpa,
congress
was
very
clear
that
no
court
could
review
the
decision
of
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
hearing
on
certiorari
when
that
court
has
made
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
allow
the
filing
of
a
second
or
a
successive
petition.
when
that
issue
was...
when
congress
decided
not
to
allow
that
issue
to
be
addressed,
it
said
so.
allowing
just
an
inference
to
arise
from
the
change
from
a
federal
right
to
a
constitutional
right
in
language
that
has
always
been
viewed
as
applicable
to
the
underlying
claim,
not
to
the
character
of
the
procedural
issues
that
may
cover
that
underlying
claim,
then
i
think,
contrary
to
jones
v.
united
states,
this
court
would
be
assuming
that
congress
intended
to
make
a
very
radical
change
in
habeas
jurisprudence
without
giving
any
indication
that
that
was
what
it
meant.
also,
if
you
look
at
section...
former
section
2244(c),
the
same
language--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--it's
at
appendix
2,
page
2
of
our
opening
brief,
in
about
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
it...
that
section
refers
to
denial
of
a
federal
right,
which
constitutes
grounds
for
discharge.
the
term,
i
submit,
denial
of
a
federal
right,
or
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
refers
to
the
underlying
claim
in
the
petition,
and
i
think
we
would
also
have
to
consider
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
problem
if
that
reading
were
adopted.
mr.
michael
pescetta
because
what
that
would
allow
would
be
entirely
one-sided
review
of
procedural
issues
in
habeas
cases.
now,
again,
when
congress
legislated
that
no
court
could
review
a
decision
of
a
panel
of
a
court
of
appeals
deciding
whether
or
not
to
allow
the
filing
of
a
second
or
successive
petition,
it
said
so
explicitly,
and
it
applied
equally
to
both
parties,
whether
it
was
granted
or
denied.
to
infer,
simply
from
the
change
of
the
word
federal
to
constitutional,
that
congress
intended
to
erect
a
system
in
which
the
federal
appellate
courts
could
never
address
anything
but
an
error
that
favored
the
petitioner
but
could
never
address
an
error
that
favored
the
state
would,
i
believe,
present
serious
equal
protection--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
that
question
depends
on
whether,
under
the
amici's
reading
of
the
jurisdictional
statute,
whether
that
is
covered
by
a
procedural
issue,
which
on
their
reasoning
you
could
never
get
past.
so
the
state
could
come
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
yes,
we
agree,
the
petitioner
has
an
absolutely
meritorious
constitutional
claim
that
entitles
him
to
relief,
and
the
district
court
erred
in
concluding
that
the
petitioner
was
1
day
late
under
the
statute
of
limitations
under
aedpa,
when,
in
fact,
it
was
1
day
early,
but
the
court
of
appeals
could
never
address
that
claim,
because
no
matter
how
compelling
the
underlying
claim
is,
no
procedural
issue
could
ever
be
reviewed
by
any
federal
appellate
court,
and
i
submit
that
that's
simply
an
irrational
inference
to
make
about
what
congress
intended
by
this
language.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor,
because
they
don't
need
a
certificate
of
appealability,
so
what
you
would
have
is
a
system
of
review
in
which,
if
the
district
court
errs
one
way
and
says
incorrectly
it's
a
day
early,
so
that
the
petitioner
really
shouldn't
be
there,
the
state
can
appeal
that,
and
that
can
be
corrected.
if
the
district
court,
concededly
erroneously,
says
the
petition
is
a
day
late,
it
doesn't
matter
how
compelling
the
underlying
claims
are,
no
federal
appellate
court
could
ever
reach
that,
and
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
adopting
amici's
view
of
what
that
language
means.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
but
my
understanding
of
the
context
of
these
habeas
proceedings
is,
congress
does
get
to
limit
what
kind
of
claims
ultimately
can
be
adjudicated,
constitutional
claims
rather
than
federal
claims.
this
court
has
done
it...
this
court
has
done
it
itself
in
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
case,
where
it
said
that's
not
really
an
error
that
rises
to
the
dignity
of
allowing
habeas
corpus
relief.
it's
very
different
when
you
say
that
only
one
side
can
get
review
of
procedural
errors
which
bar
you
or
purportedly
bar
you
from
considering
the
underlying
claims,
whatever
those
claims
are,
and
that's
our
problem
with
this
one-sided
system
that
the
reading
that
amici
give
the
statute
would
erect.
it
would
say
the
state
can
always
get
procedural,
review
of
procedural
errors
committed
by
the
district
courts
and
the
petitioner
never
can--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--and
that's
very
different
from
saying
that
the
quality
of
the
underlying
claim
can
be
decided...
can
be
decided
by
congress
as
having
to
have
sufficient
substantiality
to
warrant
relief.
mr.
michael
pescetta
occasionally
treaty
claims,
of
course.
mr.
michael
pescetta
and
breard...
this
court,
for
instance,
addressed
the
breard
case,
in
a
case
where
under
the
reading
that
amici
submit
is
the
jurisdictional
reading
of
section
2253
this
court
couldn't
have
addressed
that
case,
because
there
could
not
have
been
a...
it
could
not
have
addressed
the
procedural
default
issue
in
that
case,
because
that
was
a
procedural
issue
and
not
a
constitutional
issue.
i
would
just
like
to
go
back
to
where
we
started
on
this.
there
are
two
parallel
tracks,
exhaustion,
which
is
not
a
doctrine
of
preclusion.
exhaustion
is
a
doctrine
of
deferral.
exhaustion
says,
go
and
do
what
you
need
to
do
in
the
state
court,
and
our
doors
will
be
open
when
you
return.
abuse
is
a
res
judicata
doctrine
of
preclusion.
that
doctrine
says
to
the
petitioner,
if
you
have
had
what
mccleskey
described
as
a
full
round
of
habeas
review,
don't
come
back.
the
problem
with
the
rule
in
this
case
is,
it
has
crossed
those
and
made
a...
basically
a
monstrosity
of
combining
those
two
concepts
improperly.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
disagree,
your
honor.
every
statement
of
this
court
in
kuhlmann
v.
wilson,
in
mccleskey,
in
which
the
majority
opinion
written
by
justice
kennedy
went
into
an
extraordinarily
long
analysis
in
demonstrating
this
is
a
qualified
res
judicata
doctrine,
and
that
can't
be
applied
when
that
previous
petition,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
was
dismissed
without
prejudice.
mr.
michael
pescetta
after--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--after
the
litigation
of
that
first
round
of
habeas,
not
as
in
lonchar,
from
the
first
petition.
if
i
may,
could
i
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal?
mr.
michael
pescetta
let
me
just
cite
the
court
the
language
of
this
court's
decision
in
stewart
v.
martinez-villareal
at
page
1622
of
118
supreme
court
reports.
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
that
case
said,
we
believe
that
respondent's
fourth
claim
here,
previously
dismissed
as
premature,
should
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
the
claim
of
a
petitioner
who
returns
to
a
federal
habeas
court
after
exhausting
his
state
remedies.
later
on,
in
both
situations,
the
habeas
petitioner
did
not
receive
an
adjudication
of
his
claim.
to
hold
otherwise
would
mean
that
a
dismissal
of
a
first
habeas
petition
for
technical
procedural
reasons
would
bar
the
prisoner
from
ever
obtaining
federal
habeas
review.
mr.
michael
pescetta
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
either
we
have
a
second
or
a
successive
petition,
or
we
do
not.
if
we
have
a
second
or
a
successive
petition,
then
the
res
judicata
body
of
law
applies.
if
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
as
this
court
allowed
in
rose
v.
lundy,
counts
as
toward
counting
a
second
or
a
successive
petition,
it's
my
understanding
of
martinez-villareal
that
that's
the
petition
this
court
rejected.
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
is
a
dismissal
without
prejudice.
it
has
no--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
distinction
there,
your
honor,
is
it
has
always
been
understood
as
a
res
judicata
doctrine,
not
as
a
pleading
limitation
doctrine.
mr.
michael
pescetta
it
can't--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--it...
and
that's
our
point,
is,
that
is
a
res...
abuse
is
a
res
judicata
doctrine.
we
can't
mix
that
with
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
before
exhaustion.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
think
the
problem
there,
your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
of
it.
the
courts
of
appeals
are
absolutely
unanimous
that
under
aedpa
a
petition
filed
after
a
previous
dismissal
of
that
prejudice
for
exhaustion
is
not
second
or
successive.
mr.
michael
pescetta
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
in
the
first
argument
in
this
case
last
fall,
i
asked
the
court
to
apply
a
common
sense
rule
to
the
questions
on
which
it
granted
certiorari,
and
to
hold
that
previous
dismissals
of
the
petition
for
exhaustion
do
not
render
a
subsequent
petition
second
or
successive
within
the
meaning
of
habeas
rule
9(b)
because
that's
the
only
position--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--respectfully,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
that
that's
exactly
what
hohn
said.
i
think
what
hohn
said
was
that
the
case
enters
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
application
for
the
certificate
of
appealability.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
authorities
that
we've
cited,
in
fact,
an
old
one
decided
by
justice
oliver
wendell
holmes,
that
a
case
proceeds,
that
the
appeal
is
a
stayed
in
the
case
that's
begun
in
the
district
court,
and
the
respondents,
and
the
amici
on
behalf
of
respondents,
have
not
offered
an
alternative
definition
of
the
case.
mr.
slack's
case
was
indisputably--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
don't
think
i
would
put
it
quite
that
way,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
motion
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
addressed
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
hohn,
and
in
this
case,
elevates
the
case
that
is
in
the
district
court
into
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
a
case
that
is
at
that
point
ending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it's
not
a
case
that's
different
or
separate
from
the
case
that's
in
the
district
court.
it's
not--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
it's
the
case
that's
in
the
district
court
that
is
going
into
a
different
phase.
that's
my
understanding
of
mckenzie
v.
engelhardt,
is
that
the
case--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
don't
think
that
that
was
this
court's
intent
and,
of
course,
this
court
will
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
my
understanding
was
that
the
point
in
hohn
was
that
the
filing
of
the
motion
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
gets
the
case
from
the
district
court
in
some
fashion
to
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
same
way
that
in
a
case
where
you
don't
need
a
certificate
of
appealability
at
all,
simply
the
notice
of
appeal
gets
the
case
into
the
court
of
appeals,
but--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
slack's
case
was
pending
in
the
district
court
at
the
time
the
aedpa
was
enacted.
that
case
didn't
go
away.
it
didn't
transmute
in
some
way.
it's
the
same
case
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
our
motion
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
because,
of
course,
since
this
was
a
pre
aedpa
case,
we
asked
under
the
old
law
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
and
not
a
certificate
of
appealability,
and
we
entered
the
court
of
appeals
with
that
case
in
the
same
way
that
if
we
had
prevailed
in
the
court
below
and
the
state
had
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
notice
of
appeal
would
have
vested
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
over
this
case.
the
case
hasn't
changed.
now,
the
point
i
think
that
was
being
focused
on
in
hohn
was
whether
there
was
anything
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
motion
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
in
that
case,
and
this
court
said
yes,
that's
correct,
and
it's
our
position
that
our
case,
the
case
that
was
pending
at
the
time
the
aedpa
was
enacted,
did
vest
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
to
bring
that
case
up
by
granting
a
certificate
of
appealability,
and
it's
the
same
case
that's
before
this
court
on
the
propriety
of
the
court
of
appeals'
denial
of
that
certificate
of
appealability...
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor,
because
at
no
point
in
the
prior
proceedings
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
or
in
this
court
until
the
argument
in
the
fall,
did
the
respondent
state
ever
say
that
any
portion
of
the
aedpa
applied
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
pescetta
only
because
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly...
have
not
uniformly,
but
in
the
main
treated
the...
or,
the
substantive
requirements
for
certificate
of
appealability
as
the
same
as
those
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
if,
as
we
argue
in
the
second
part
of
our
argument,
that
all
the
certificate
of
appealability
was
intended
by
congress
to
do,
which
was
the
only
position
asserted
by
the
proponents
of
the
legislation,
was
to
adopt
the
barefoot
standard,
then
it's
purely
a
question
of
terminology,
terminology
and,
of
course,
the
specification
of
issues
provision.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
state
can't
rely
on
any
defect
either
in
the
specification
of
issues
provision,
or
in
whether
we
call
this
a
certificate
of
appealability
or
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
because
we
asked
the
district
court
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
issue
was
joined
under
pre
aedpa
law.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
under
pre
aedpa
law,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
our
petition
under
pre
aedpa
law,
and
the
question
of
whether
any
portion
of
the
aedpa
would
apply
to
this
case
was
injected
into
this
case
by
the
state
attorney
general
amici,
who
claimed
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
problem
under
section
2253.
but
our
position
is
simply
that
lindh
controls
this
case.
our
case
was
pending
at
the
time
the
aedpa
was
enacted.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
agree
that
they
might
be
different,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
justice
souter's
opinion
for
the
court
in
lindh
was
that
we
have
these
two
chapters,
154
and
153.
by
clearly
mandating
that
the
chapter
154,
the
opt
in
provisions,
apply
to
cases
pending
at
the
time
of
the
act,
the
negative,
the
strong
negative
inference
arose
that
the
chapter
153
provisions
and
the
amendments
to
section
2253
and
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
are
in
chapter
153,
don't.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
a
different
explanation.
the
opt
in
provisions
are
not
stand
alone.
they
do
not
have
the,
for
instance,
the
review
provisions
of
section
2254(d),
which
were
in
the
chapter
153
amendments.
they
don't
have
the
separate
appeal
section.
and
it's
our
view
of
what
lindh
intended
to
hold
by
that
use
of
the
word,
generally,
was
that
anything
that
falls
within
the
opt
in
provisions
that
are
covered
by
chapter
154,
take
along
with
them
the
general
provisions
that
were
enacted
by
the
aedpa
as
to
those
cases
which
qualify
for
the
opt
in
treatment.
i'd
emphasize
mr.
slack's
case
is
not
only
a
nonopt
in
case,
it's
not
a
capital
case,
and
so
under
those
circumstances,
if
you
are
in
the
opt
in
world,
all
of
the
amendments
to
both
chapter
153
and
154
would
apply.
but
if
you're
not
under
chapter
154
there,
i
think,
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
chapter
153
amendments
which
apply
to
everybody
else
apply
to
a
case
pending,
which
mr.
slack's
case
clearly
was
at
the
time
the
aedpa
was
enacted.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
submit
that
the
inference
that
this
court
drew
in
lindh
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
the
opt
in
and
the
nonopt
in
chapters,
is
exactly
the
same
in
both
situations,
especially
since
we
have
the
additional
problem
that
applying
different
parts
of
aedpa
to
different
parts
of
the
case
and
different
cases,
depending
on
whether
they're
on
appeal
or
not,
would
raise
the
same
kind
of...
i
think
justice
breyer
referred
to
it
as
a
mare's
nest
of
problems.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
will
turn
to
that
now.
i
think
the
fact
that
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
reduces
somewhat
the
force
of
the
negative
inference
to
be
drawn,
as
in
lindh,
from
the
focus
on
pending
cases
in
chapter
154.
i
think
the
more...
the
greater
the
impact
that
the
state
argues
for
of
the
appeal
provisions,
the
stronger
that
negative
inference
is
that
they
shouldn't
be
applied.
but
to
turn
to
your
honor's
question,
and
to
the
question
that
i
think
justice
o'connor
raised
about
jurisdictions
in
the
last
argument,
the
current
certificate
of
appealability
standard
is
that
you
have
to
show...
make
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
and,
in
using
that
terminology,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
sort
suggesting
that
congress
had
any
intent
in
using
that
phrase,
other
than
to
use
it
as
a
shorthand
for
the
phrase,
violation
of
the
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states
that
appears
in
section
2254
and
in
2241,
and
that's
consistent
both
with
this
court's
practice,
with
this
court's
use
of
the
terminology,
and
with
the
use
of
the
indiscriminate
use
of
the
term,
federal
right,
constitutional
right,
throughout
the
aedpa.
i
would
just
like--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
think,
your
honor,
it
means
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states
as
a
shorthand.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
mccleskey
v.
zant,
for
instance,
where
this
court
is
discussing
the
history
of
the
great
writ,
at
pages
478
to
479
of
499
u.s.,
this
court's
majority
opinion,
authored
by
justice
kennedy,
refers
to
and
quotes
wainwright
v.
sykes
as
saying,
quote,
review
is
available
for
claims
of,
quote,
disregard
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused
and
later
on,
quote,
the
writ
today
appears
to
extend
to
all
dispositive
constitutional
claims
presented
in
a
proper
procedural
manner.
so
my
position
is,
if
that
kind
of
shorthand...
because
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
intent
in
mccleskey
or
in
wainwright
v.
sykes--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
your
honor,
that's
exactly,
i
think,
my
point,
is
that
this
court
uses
shorthand
the
same
way
that
congress
does.
when
you
say
habeas
is
there
to
redress
constitutional
rights,
you
don't
say...
in
every
opinion
you
don't
repeat
the
phrase
from
section
2254--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
difficulty
with
that,
your
honor,
is,
it
doesn't
look
at
the
whole
statute
which,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
standards
of
statutory
construct--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes,
your
honor,
but
if
you
look,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
briefing,
at
the
use
of
the
term,
constitutional
right
and
federal
right,
throughout
the
aedpa,
particularly...
and
i
would
cite
as
kind
of
exhibit
a,
you
know,
under
section
2254(d),
a
grant
of
habeas
relief
is
allowed
if
the
state
court's
disposition
violates
clearly
established
federal
law.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
yes.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
has
not
been
argued--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--and
the
state
hasn't
argued
to
the
contrary.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
second
part
of
our
argument,
is
that
whatever
this
provision
means,
it
can
mean
only
the
review
of
the
substantive
underlying
claim.
there
is
no
decision
by
any
court
that
says
a
denial
of
a...
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
cannot
be
made
on
the
basis
of
showing,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
district
court
erroneously
refused
to
address
a
substantive
constitutional
claim
at
all
because
of
a
procedural
error.
mr.
michael
pescetta
your
honor--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--we
don't
have
to
reach
that
point,
because
our
underlying
claims
are
constitutional.
our--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--our--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--our
position
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
to
decide
this
case
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
whether
the
underlying
claim
is
constitutional
or
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
this
court
can--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--it's--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i've
expressed
myself
badly,
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is,
you
have
a
substantive
underlying
constitutional
claim
which
attacks
something,
whether
substantive
or
procedural,
that
happened
in
the
state
proceedings.
that's
the
basis
for
relief.
the
state,
and
amici's
position,
is
that
if
review
of
that
underlying
claim
that
you've
raised
in
your
federal
petition
is
barred
by
a
procedural
error
that
the
district
court
commits,
such
as
in
this
case
by
holding
that
a
petition
is
second
or
successive
when
it's
not,
it's
their
position
that
this
amendment
to
2253
prevents
us
from
ever
getting
any
appellate
review
of
that
question,
either
as
to
the
underlying
substantive
question
or
as
to
the
validity
of
the
procedural
ruling.
and
our
position
is,
this
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
practice,
it
is
contradicted
by
the
use
of
the...
by
aedpa's
explicit
limits
on
this
court's
jurisdiction
such
as
in
224...
such
as
in
22...
section
2244(c),
or
rather
2244(b)(3)(e),
where
in
aedpa
the
congress
said,
you
cannot
review
on
certiorari
or
a
rehearing
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
whether
or
not
to
allow
the
filing
of
a
second
or
a
successive
petition.
it's
our
position
that
this
was
not
in
congress'
mind,
that
the
only
thing
before
congress
at
the
time
that
this
provision
was
enacted
that
mr.
lundgren,
who
was
then
the
attorney
general
of
california
and
one
of
the
major
proponents
of
this
legislation
said,
was,
we
want
to
codify
barefoot.
it's
our
position
that
that
is
all
that
happened
in--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--barefoot
v.
estelle.
mr.
michael
pescetta
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
thank
you,
your
honor.
there's
a
thread
in
this
court's
statutory
interpretations
cases
that's
expressed
in
justice
kennedy's
opinion
for
the
court
in
hohn,
justice
souter's
opinion
for
the
court
in
jones
v.
united
states,
that's
expressed
in
many
other
cases,
that
we
do
not...
it
is
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
intended
a
major
change
in
practice
without
making
that
intent
clear.
what
the
state's
position
on
the
scope
of
the
certificate
of
appealability
is
that
without
any
indication,
any
discussion,
congress
intended
by
enacting
section
2253
to
erect
an
entirely
one
sided
system
of
review
of
procedural
errors
in
habeas
cases
in
the
federal
court,
and
the
idea
that
congress
would
have
done
that,
would
have
imposed
on
this
court
and
on
the
courts
of
appeals
the
burden
of
regulating
district
court
procedural
rulings
in
habeas
cases
by
extraordinary
writ,
simply
is
not
reasonable.
the
substantiality
question
that's
been
raised
by
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
as
to
the
substantiality
of
the
underlying
claim,
we
have
to
remember,
mr.
slack
has
never
gotten
a
hearing,
has
never
had
any
proceedings
on
the
substantiality
of
his
underlying
claim.
all
we
have
is
a
procedural
ruling
covering
allegations
which
for
the
purpose
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
have
to
be
taken
as
true.
it's
our
position
that
if
the
procedural
ruling
covers
allegations
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim,
then
the
procedural
ruling
has
to
be
reviewable,
otherwise
we
have
a
monstrosity
of
a
statute
which
is
replicated
in
no
other
area
of
the
law,
where
one
side
has
the
right
to
have
procedural
errors
reviewed
and
the
other
doesn't.
third--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
don't
necessarily...
well,
i
think
the
problem
with
the
historical
practice...
the
short
answer
is
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
the
problem
is,
because
of
the
predominance
of
procedural
issues
in
habeas
practice,
the
practice
has
developed
that
we
focus
on
the
procedural
issue
as
the
grounds
for
denying
the
coa...
rather,
the
cpc,
and
the
underlying
merits
of
the
constitutional
claims
are
assumed
because,
for
the
purpose
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
they
have
to
be
taken
as
true.
third,
there
is
no
change,
as
it
has
been
expressed,
from
federal
to
constitutional
in
the
statute.
the
law
before
the
adoption
of
the
aedpa
was
barefoot,
which
used
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
federal
right,
but
which
also
used
terms
like,
questions
of
some
substance,
issues
debatable
among
jurists
of
reason.
it's
our
position
that
congress,
in
a
number
of
bills
which
indiscriminately
used
the
term
federal
right
or
constitutional
right,
was
trying
to
do
one
thing.
it
was
simply
trying
to
adopt
the
barefoot
standard.
it
was
not
100
percent
clear,
as
many
things
in
the
aedpa
are
not
100
percent
clear,
but
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
before
this
court,
or
in
all
of
the
proceedings
before
congress,
that
the
congressional
intent
was
anything
else.
thank
you.
