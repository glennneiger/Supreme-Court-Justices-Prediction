mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
certificate
of
appealability
provisions
applied
to
petitioner
because
he
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
after
aedpa
was
enacted.
petitioner
may
obtain--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
accept
the...
a
reading
of
lindh
that
the
question
of
whether
the
provisions
apply
turns
on
whether
the
case
that
they
governed
was
pending
when
aedpa
was
enacted
and,
because
those
provisions
govern
only
the
discrete
proceeding
in
which
the
habeas
petitioner
seeks
authorization
to
appeal,
we
think
that's
the
relevant
case
for
determining
their
applicability.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--our
position
isn't
any
more...
isn't
materially
more
complex,
justice
breyer.
it's
just
that
the...
whether
the
provision
at
issue
is
applicable
turns
on
whether
the
case
that
it
governs
is
pending,
and
for
all
the
provisions
of
aedpa
except
for
the
certificate
requirements,
that
will
mean
that
it's
triggered
by
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
the
district
court,
because
all
of
those
provisions--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
makes--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
case
can
mean
different
things
in
a
different
context,
and
that's
why
we
think
that
it's
justifiable
to
do
it
here,
because
it
makes
sense,
because
appellate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
right.
it
is
just
a
transitional
rule,
and
there
are
probably
very
few
cases
that
are
still
pending
that
it
applies
to,
and
it
makes
sense,
because
traditionally
and
logically
appeal
procedures
like
the
certificate
requirement
have
applied
to
appellate
proceedings
that
commence
after
the
procedures
are
enacted,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
first,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
read
hohn
that
way,
your
honor,
because...
because
under
hohn
the
case
couldn't
have
been
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
underlying
case
couldn't
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
a
certificate
hadn't
issued,
so
hohn
had
to
hold
that
it
was
a
separate
case
to
achieve
the
result
of
making
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
in
any
case,
as
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
justice
breyer,
it
doesn't
make
it
materially
more
complicated.
it
means
that
for
this
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
the
certificate
provisions
only,
they
apply
if
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
after
aedpa
was
enacted,
and
that
makes
sense
because
they
govern
only
appeal
procedures,
and
it
makes
sense
to
apply
a
provision
that
governs
only
appeal
procedures
to
appellate
proceedings
that
begin
after
they're
enacted.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
that
that
gets
to
the
same
point,
and
that
it's
not
retroactive
to
apply
it
here.
that's
part
of
the
reason
that
it
makes
sense.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
okay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
believe
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
certificate
only
if
he
makes
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
and
when,
as
in
this
case,
the
district
court
has
denied
relief
on
procedural
grounds.
that
showing
has
two
parts,
first,
that
there's
a
substantial
argument
that
he
can
overcome
the
procedural
bar
and,
second,
that
there's
a
substantial
argument
that
his
habeas
petition
raises
a
meritorious
claim.
he
can
appeal
if
there's
a
clear
procedural
bar
to
relief,
because
permitting
appeals
based
on
the
abstract
merit
of
the
underlying
claim
when
relief
on
that
claim
is
unavailable
would
thwart
the
purpose
of
a
certificate
requirement
to
prevent
frivolous
or
unnecessary
appeals.
and
he
also
can't
appeal
if
his
underlying
constitutional
claim
clearly
lacks
merit,
even
if
the
district
court
may
have
erred
in
denying
relief
on
procedural
grounds,
and
that
limitation
is
imposed
by
the
term,
constitutional,
in
the
certificate
standard,
and
it
accords
with
the
purpose
of
the
certificate
requirement,
because
there's
no
need
to
correct
a
district
court's
procedural
error
if
that
error
prevents
consideration
of
only
meritless
claims.
we
don't
think
that
appeal
is
foreclosed
just
because
the
district
court
denies
relief
on
procedural
grounds.
precluding
appeals
from
procedural
orders
in
all
cases
would
not
further
the
purpose
of
the
certificate
requirement,
because
it
would
bar
appeals
of
meritorious
habeas
petitions
that
raise
constitutional
claims,
and
it
wouldn't
be
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
certificate
standard
either,
because
a
prisoner
makes
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
if
he
makes
a
substantial
showing
that
his
conviction
was
imposed
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
habeas
court
erred
in
refusing
him
relief.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
we
think
that
you
should
hold
that
the
certificate
of
appealability
provisions
apply,
and
that
the
standard
in
this
circumstance
has
the
two
parts
that
we
said,
and
then
either,
depending
on
what
the
court
wanted
to
do,
there
would
be
two
options
in
that
circumstance.
one,
the
court
could
address
the
question
that
it
initially
granted
certiorari
on
in
the
course
of
answering
the
first
part
of
that
standard,
and
then
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
if
the
court...
i
think
that
if
the
court
thinks
that
the
first...
that
the
question
that
it
initially
granted
certiorari
on
is
a
question
of
continuing
importance
that
it
still
wants
to
resolve,
that
would
be
an
acceptable
way
to
do
it.
otherwise,
the
court
should
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
application
of
the
standard.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
