unknown
speaker
why
do
you
call
this
a
change
in
the
substantive
law,
mr.
bernstein,
rather
than
a
change
in
the
evidentiary
rules?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
sort
of
a
witness
competency
statute,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
what
it's
dealing
with.
the
witness
was
a
witness
before
and
after,
but
would
texas
allow
that
witness
to
be
a
competent
witness?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
it
was
pretty
close
to
hopt
where...
where
convicted
felons
were
originally
not
considered
competent
to
testify,
and
then
there
was
a
change
and
they
were.
unknown
speaker
and
someone
would
have
been
convicted
after
the
change
but
not
before
if
that's
the
only
witness.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
a
witness
competency
issue,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
statute,
the
texas
statute,
talks
about
the
testimony
being
corroborated
or
not--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
exactly
what
the...
some
of
the
other
witness
competency
statutes
talk
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
take...
take
the
traditional
common
law
rule
that
you
can't
convict
someone
on
their
own
confession
without
some
corroboration.
now,
would
you
call
that
an
evidentiary
rule
or
what
you
call
a--
unknown
speaker
--you
spoke
of
the
comparability
of
mr.
fenwick.
wasn't
the...
the
prior
rule
in
fenwick,
which
was,
in
effect,
dispensed
with,
the
rule
that
there
had
to
be
two
witnesses
to
the
treasonous
act?
unknown
speaker
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
the
kind
of
rule
that
we
have
here
because,
as
i
read
the...
the
prior
texas
statute,
it
didn't
require
a
second
witness
to
the
sexual
act.
it
simply
required
corroboration,
and
that
corroboration,
for
example,
might
be
the
testimony
of
a...
of
a
doctor
who
would
examine
the
victim
afterwards
and...
and
so
on.
so,
if...
if
the...
if
your
argument
is
that
this
is
like...
the
change
here
is
like
the
change
in
the
fenwick
situation,
that
seems
wrong
to
me.
could
you
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
written
broader.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
question.
but
do
you
agree
that
this
is
not
a
situation
like
fenwick's?
unknown
speaker
but
not
a
witness...
not
an
eye
witness
to
the
act.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
enough
if
there
was
an
outcry.
it
was
corroboration
or
outcry.
unknown
speaker
if
she
had
simply
told
her
mother
earlier,
that
would
have
been
it.
unknown
speaker
no
question.
any...
i
mean,
any
evidence
depends
ultimately
on
a
witness--
unknown
speaker
--to
get
the
evidence
in.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
about
the
corroboration
here
that
the...
the
defendant
himself
passed
that
note
to
his
wife,
adultery
with
km?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
as
a
matter
of
texas
law,
though,
since
we're
talking
about
the
nature
of
this
thing?
would
that...
is
there
a
texas
case
that
says
that
sort
of
corroboration
is
not
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
that
question
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but
presumably
the
defendant
is
an
eye
witness.
unknown
speaker
and
he
has
said,
adultery
with
km.
why
isn't
that
good
enough?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
i
say,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
talking
about
what's
before
us
in
this
particular
ex
post
facto
issue,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
some
feel
for
exactly
what
the
texas
statute
requires.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bernstein,
would
the
argument
you're
making
carry
over
to
a
case
where
the
evidentiary
rule
that
was
changed
was
the
rule
that
a
defendant
could
bring
up
the
victim's
past
sexual
conduct?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
say...
as
you
say,
the
line
is
very
difficult
to
draw.
how
about
the
case
where
someone
is
tried
for
treason
and
only
one
witness
testifies
to
an
overt
act?
is
that
an
evidentiary
rule
or
a
failure
of
the
case
for
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
but
fenwick's
case
was
very
much
a
bill
of
attainder,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
they
were
out
to
get
him.
they
weren't
changing
the
general
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bernstein,
all
of
these
cases
seem
to
be
quite
far
afield
from
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
what
the
texas
law
did
was
to
make
a
witness
fully
competent
who
hadn't
been
fully
competent
before.
you
needed
something
more.
and
in
the
old
days,
you
know,
there
were
all
kinds
of
rules
ranking
witnesses
in
terms
of
their
thought
of
credibility,
like
two
jews
equal
one
christian.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's...
that's
the
kind
of
rule
we're
dealing
with
here.
this
14-year-old
was
regarded
as
not
a
fully
competent
witness,
and
then
the
legislature
recognizes
that
she
is
a
fully
competent
witness.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
call
it
substantive,
if
it's
just
going
to
witness
competency.
it's
just
labeling
something
rather
than
thinking
through
what
it
really
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
is...
is
set
out
in
the
texas
courts...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
read
quite
the
way
you
say.
it
says,
a
conviction
under...
is...
is
supportable--
unknown
speaker
--on
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
say,
only
if.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
if
you're
going
to
quote
a
statute,
you
should
probably
do
it
in
hic
verba.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
a
question
about
this
witness...
as
i
understand
it,
this
witness
was
competent
before.
unknown
speaker
the
witness
could
testify
before.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
law
in
texas
in
respect
to
a
person
who's
not
a
minor
accused...
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
involving
a
victim
who's
not
a
minor?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
whether
to
think
about
this
as
a
witness...
as
a
witness
qualification
case,
in
which
case
i
guess
you'd
have
a
hard
time,
or
to
think
of
it
as
a
change
in
the
amount
of
proof
case,
which
is
what
you're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
so,
looking
at
it
in
context,
i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
the
context.
it's
certainly
an
odd
system
that
says,
where
the
child
is
the
victim,
you
can
go
on
uncorroborated
testimony.
unknown
speaker
but
where
an
adult
is
the
victim,
you
need
either
corroboration
or
outcry.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
rationale
for
that?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that...
is
this
right...
that
with
an
adult
who's
a
victim
we
think,
for
whatever
set
of
circumstances,
whether
right
or
wrong...
and
they
may
be
wrong
in
my
opinion
or
yours
or
somebody
else's
and
right
in
theirs.
but
whether
right
of
wrong,
the
victims
here...
we're
going
to
need
special,
extra
evidence.
but
where
it's
a
victim
at
stake
who's
a
child,
it's
so
serious
we
don't
need
that
special,
extra
evidence.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
way
you
want
me
to
look
at
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we've
already
seen
that
this
is
scarcely
a
bright
line
rule
since
both
from
the
bench
and...
and
i
think
your
response,
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line
you're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
the...
the
trick
is
in
the
classification.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
justice
o'connor
suggests
that
you
don't
just
get
where
you
want
to
go
by
labeling.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bernstein,
would
you
clarify
one
thing?
you
said
something
about
18
was
the
dividing
line,
but
this
child
was...
wasn't
she
14?
unknown
speaker
but
she
wasn't
trusted
as...
isn't
that
basically
what
it
is?
if
it's
a
child
of
5,
we
think
that
she
couldn't
possibly
have
consented
or
wanted
this,
and
when
14
was...
texas
once
thought
was
the
age
at
which
the
victim
becomes
incredible.
unknown
speaker
let's
go
in
again
to
your
statement
about
the
difference
between
the
new
trial
and...
and
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
in
what
cases
do
you
say
that
the...
an
evidentiary
rule
would
require
simply
a
new
trial
or
where
there
was
not...
the
witness
was
incompetent?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in...
suppose
in
texas
you
had
a...
a...
this
second
witness
who
testifies,
but
then
on
appeal,
that
testimony
is
stricken
because
of
hearsay
or
something
like
that,
no
confrontation.
new
trial
then
or?
unknown
speaker
insufficient.
unknown
speaker
well,
so...
so
then
doesn't
that
indicate
that
this
could
be
something
other
than
a
substantive
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
are
we
dealing
with
here?
this...
this...
your
client
i
guess
was
convicted
of
several
counts.
unknown
speaker
and
we're
dealing
here
with
only
some
of
those
counts?
unknown
speaker
and
the
underlying
goal
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
you
think
is
served
by
adopting
your
position
here?
unknown
speaker
if
so,
how?
unknown
speaker
i...
may
i
interrupt?
it
seems
to
me
in
collins
we
said
that...
that
that
distinction
is
not
very
useful,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
interrupted
you
when
you
were
answering
justice
o'connor's
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
was
really
hoping
you'd
address
the
underlying
goals
of
the
clause.
unknown
speaker
what
are
we
trying
to
protect
people
from?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
isn't
a
very
sympathetic
case
with
somebody
who's
been
abusing
his
stepdaughter.
unknown
speaker
so,
we're
concerned
because
he
should
have
known
that
she
was
over
14?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
bernstein,
if
the...
one
of
the
prime
bases,
i
think
you
would
agree,
for
the
ex
post
facto
bar
is
it's
not
fair
to
have
a
crime
be
one
thing
when
the
defendant
commits
it
and
another
when
he's
subject
to
conviction.
now,
here
there
can't
be
any
question
about
fair
warning
or
notice
to
the
defendant.
he
couldn't
have
anticipated
that
the
child
wasn't
going
to
tell
her
mother.
unknown
speaker
but
here,
mr.
bernstein,
unlike
the
fenwick
case
where
they
wanted
to
get
this
person,
there's
no
indication
that
any...
that
the
legislature
was
doing
anything
but
updating
its
rules
of
evidence,
bringing
them
in
line
with
the
more
modern
trend.
unknown
speaker
does
it
matter
that
in
the...
in
the
attainder...
or
in
the
treason
cases,
the
individual
who
commits
his
treasonous
act
very
carefully
in
front
of
one
witness
only
knows
that
he
has
a
defense,
whereas
here,
as
was
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
when
these
acts
are
committed,
the...
the
putative
defendant
has
no
way
whatsoever
of
knowing--
unknown
speaker
--whether
there
is
going
to
be
a
defense?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the...
at
the...
i
suppose
the
core
of
the...
of
the
old
treason
rule
did,
in
fact,
give
a
defense
and
give
a
person
a
right
to
rely
defensively
upon
his
care
in...
in
committing
his
arguably
treasonous
act
or
making
the
treasonous
statement
in
front
of
one
person
only--
unknown
speaker
--whereas,
there's
no
comparable
argument
that
can
be
made
here.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bernstein.
general
cornyn,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
evidentiary
rules,
and...
and
the
normal
meaning
i
think
is...
is
what
evidence
is
admissible
and
what
isn't
admissible.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
this
evidence
was
admissible
before
and
it
was
admissible
after.
it
goes
to,
you
know,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
i
wouldn't
normally
call
that
an
evidentiary
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
an
evidentiary
rule.
the
evidence
couldn't
come
in
before
and
it
could
come
in
afterwards.
it's
a
rule
pertaining
to
the
exclusion
or
admission
of
evidence,
but
it
wasn't
a
rule
as
to
how
much
evidence
you
need
to
convict
of
the
crime.
isn't
that
a
basic
distinction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
mr.
bernstein
that
under
texas
law
under
the
previous
statutory
regime,
that
if
there
was
a
conviction
without
the
extra...
without
the
second
witness,
it
then
goes
up...
it's
reversed
for
that
reason...
there
can
be
no
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
does
indicate
it's
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
problem
under
texas
law
at
least.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
doesn't
his
argument
that
a
reversal
for
want
of
the
required
witness
commands
an
acquittal
show
that
under
texas
law
at
least
this
is
a...
a
sufficiency
of...
of
the
evidence
problem?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
is
the
difference?
i
mean,
suppose
that...
it's
hard
to
imagine
an
example,
but
suppose
a
state
had
a
rule
that
in
certain
cases
you
had
to
have
proof
stronger
than
a
reasonable
doubt,
double
reasonable
doubt,
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt,
and
then
one
day
they
changed
it
and
made
it
just
ordinary
reasonable
doubt.
would
that
invoke
ex
post
facto
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sufficiency--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
ex
post
facto--
unknown
speaker
--you're
saying
even
if
it
has
to
do
with
sufficiency
completely
and
only--
unknown
speaker
--it's
still
the
ex
post...
why
not?
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
treason
case?
i...
i
have
your
answer
to
that.
i...
i
understand
it.
thank
you.
what
about
the
treason
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
just
imagine
that
a
statute
says
you
have
to
have
two
witnesses
and
they
change
it
and
say
you
don't
have
to
have
two
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
general
cornyn,
could
you
comment
on
this
aspect?
this
is
a...
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
tricky
case,
but
one
of
the
things
that
seems
to
run
through
the
cases
your
opponent
relies
on
is
that
they
are
crime-specific
to
the
particular
crime
at
issue,
whereas
the
rules
you
rely
on
seem
to
me
changes
in
the
rule
that
apply
across
the
board
like
all
convicted
felons
can
testify
and
changes
in
hearsay.
do
you
think
that's
a
possible
valid
distinction?
unknown
speaker
well,
general
cornyn,
you...
you
appear
at
least
to
be
acknowledging
that
you
think
in
this
case
the
legal
change
that
was
made
affected
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
was
required.
you...
you
go
that
far.
unknown
speaker
yes?
you
acknowledge
that
i
think
here
in
court
and
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
you
go
on
to
say,
but
it's
not
constitutionally
significant.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
kind
of
a
line
should
we
draw
then?
how
do
we
know
when
it's
constitutionally
significant
if
that's
the
line?
your
opponent
says
the
line
is
whether
it's
an
evidentiary
change
or
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
change.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
some
justification
in
our
jurisprudence
for
that
line.
but
you
apparently
want
us
to
draw
a
different
one,
and
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
general
cornyn,
you...
you
cited
beazell
twice
and
it
did
not
mention
the
fourth
category,
but
it
did
say
that
changes
in
rules
of
evidence
can
be
applied
retroactively
if
they...
and
this
is
the
court's
words...
operate
only
in
limited
and
unsubstantial
manner
to
defendant's
disadvantage.
and
here
one
couldn't
say
that
about
this
rule
because
it
was
a
difference
between
enough
evidence
to
convict
and
not
enough
evidence
to
convict.
unknown
speaker
may
i
call
your
attention
to
one
other
thought,
general
cornyn?
you...
you
stressed
the
fact
that
some
of
our
opinions
just
kind
of
ignored
the
fourth
category
in...
in
calder.
but
in
collins
itself,
the
court
concludes
the
holding
in
kring
can
only
be
justified
if
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
thought
to
include
not
merely
the
calder
categories,
but
any
change
which
alters
the
situation
to
a
party's
disadvantage.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
all
four
calder
categories
have
vitality?
unknown
speaker
what
are
those
core
concerns?
i
mean,
let's
take
the
third
category.
every
law
that
changes
the
punishment
and
inflicts
a
greater
punishment
than
the
law
annexed
to
the
crime.
there's
no
reliance
interest
there.
the
person,
when
he...
when
he
did
the
deed,
knew
it
was
wrong,
knew
it
was
unlawful,
knew...
knew
it...
it
was
punishable,
and
just
increasing
the...
the
penalty...
i
think
that's
an
insignificant
reliance
interest,
that
he
didn't
expect
to
be
punished
that
much.
certainly
we
wouldn't
take
account--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what...
what
if
the
legislature
changed
the
penalty
from
a
maximum
of
1
year
to
a
maximum
of
20
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
would
you
say
that...
there
was
some
reliance
interest,
that
someone
might
go
out
and
commit
a
crime...
i'm
willing
to
serve
a
year
for
it,
but
i'm
not
willing
to
serve
20
years
for
it?
unknown
speaker
can
we
assume
in
this
case,
if
we
take
it
as
a
beginning
point...
and
you
may
argue
about
it,
but
if
we
take
as
a
beginning
point
that
it
is
an
ex
post
facto
law
to
lessen
the
government's
burden
of
proof,
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
again,
from
a
policy
standpoint,
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
purposes
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
government
must
meet
cannot
be
lessened,
this
falls
under
that...
that
same
rationale.
unknown
speaker
your
basic
point
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy
is
you
say
a
rule
of
law
that
made
it
tougher
to
convict
somebody
by
raising
the
burden
of
proof,
if
we
could
imagine
such
a
thing,
would
not
fall
within
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
unknown
speaker
then
if
that...
if
we
don't
accept
that,
then
do
you
lose
on
the
ground
that
this...
is
that...
in
other
words,
i'm
trying
to
see
if
that's
the
basic
issue.
if...
if
it
is
the
case
there
could
be
some
substantive
rule,
you
know,
of
amount
of
proof
that
would
fall
within
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
then
would
you
lose
on
the
ground
that,
you
know,
as
they
argue,
this
is
such
a
case?
this
is
a
case
involving
the
amount
of
evidence,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
but
this
isn't
a
question
of
more
evidence
being
allowed.
it's
a
question
of
how
much
evidence
is
required
for
a
conviction.
it's
a
quite
different
question.
unknown
speaker
but
the
difference
is
you
get
exactly
the
same
evidence
in
two
separate
trials,
one
conducted
before
the
stat
and
one...
one,
you
get
an
acquittal;
the
other,
you
get
a
conviction.
so,
it's
really
not
just
an
evidentiary
rule.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
point
is
it's
case
dispositive
on
the
same
evidence,
whereas
all
these
other
cases,
you
say,
well,
the
difference
in
the
rule,
let
more
evidence
in
or
kept
some
evidence
out,
but
here
you've
got
exactly
the
same
evidence
in
two
cases.
in
one
you
get
an
acquittal;
in
one...
one,
a
conviction.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
if
there
is
a
conviction
without
the
adequate
amount
of
evidence,
as
required
by
the
statute,
on
appeal
that
conviction
will
not
only
be
set
aside
for
a
new
trial,
but
the
conviction
will
be
reversed
and
the
defendant
will
be
released
as...
as
having
been
tried
and
found
not
guilty?
whereas,
if
there's
just
an
evidentiary
mistake,
in
texas
as
elsewhere,
if
there's
been
a
conviction,
the
defendant
can
be
retried
again.
is...
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
texas
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
seems
to
me
to
indicate
a...
really
a
significant
difference
between
rules
of
evidence
and...
and
the
rule
that's
at
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
the
neighboring
jurisdiction,
new
mexico,
treats
it
as...
as
procedural.
i...
i
suppose
that
we
could
have
a
federal
ex
post
facto
rule
that
is
different
between
the
two
states.
we
accept
the
state's
characterization
of
its
own
law.
or
is
that
incorrect?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
cornyn.
ms.
brinkmann.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
mr.
bernstein's
point
and
our
discussion
in
this
context
is
just
to
show
that
this
is
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule,
and
if
you
accept
that,
then
does
petitioner
prevail
here?
unknown
speaker
it...
it
has
to
do
with
whether...
whether
the
defendant
could
be
convicted
or
not.
unknown
speaker
without
that
evidence,
he
couldn't
be
convicted.
unknown
speaker
and
the
new
law
says
that
without
that
evidence
he
can
be
convicted.
i
mean,
how
is
that
any
different
from
changing
the...
or
maybe
you
think
that
that's
okay
too,
changing
the
burden
of
proof
from
one
standard
to
another
so
the
government
now
does
not
have
to
prove
quite
as
much
in...
in
order
to
get
a
conviction.
would...
would
that
be
covered
by--
unknown
speaker
--it
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
reject
the
third
category
as
well
as
the
fourth.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
third
category
makes
unlawful,
under
the
ex
post
facto
provision,
increasing
the
penalty.
so
long
as
you
knew
it
was...
it
was
wrong,
no
harm
done
in
increasing
the
penalty.
unknown
speaker
you're
going
to
just
tag
that
on.
but...
but
i
mean,
that
gives
away
your...
your
whole...
your
whole
thesis
of
reliance--
unknown
speaker
--being
the
fundamental
concern.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
crime
in...
in
category
three.
it
was
a
crime
in
category
three.
all
you're
doing
is
saying,
you
know,
we
thought
about
it,
and
that
crime
is
really
more
serious
than
we
really
thought
originally.
and
he
knew
it
was
wrong
and
we're
going
to
increase
the
penalty.
unknown
speaker
it
only
applies
when
you
increase
it
20...
20-fold.
if
you
just
increased
it,
you
know,
a
couple
of
months,
it
would
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
changes--
unknown
speaker
--it
changes
the
legal
consequence
for
innocent
people
who
are
around
uncorroborated...
they
now
have
to
worry
about
the
uncorroborated
child's
testimony.
and
i
can
easily
see
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
affecting
how
people
behave,
particularly
the
innocent
ones
when
they're
around
children
without
corroboration
in
certain
circumstances.
i
mean,
do
you
see?
so,
if
we're
talking
about
real
behavior
of
people,
this
may
affect
more
than
most.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
it's
the
opposite.
i'm
thinking
of
the
innocent
person.
in
any
crime,
there's
a
shadow
area
around
the
crime
that
people
tiptoe
around,
and
you
suddenly
bring
in
uncorroborated
children's
witnesses
and
the
person
operating
in,
let's
say,
the
shadow
area
without
corroboration
could
really
have
his
behavior
affected--
unknown
speaker
--in
terms
of
knowing
or
believing
what
the
criminal
consequence
would
be.
now,
maybe
it
should
be,
but
at
least
previously
he
thought
it
wasn't
and
now...
it's
like
treason.
suppose
you
took
away
any
witness
requirements.
there
you'd
have
the
uncorroborated
victim
of
the
treason.
you
see,
that
might
affect
people's
behavior.
it
might
have
in
the
18th
century.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the--
--ms.
brinkmann,
do
you
think
there's
anything
left
of
the
fourth
category
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
then
it's
an
unnecessary
category?
it's
just...
it's
just
overlap?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
it's
a
bill
of
attainder,
why
do
we
need
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
you...
this
is
a
definition
of
ex
post
facto,
not
bill
of
attainder.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
doesn't
work.
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying
that
you
don't
need
that
because
we
know
that
bill
of
attainders
are...
are
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
ms.
brinkmann,
one
of
the
problems
that
i
have
with
the
argument
that
you
are
making
from
the...
the
concept
of
the
core
objectives
of
the
clause
is
in
finding
a...
a
clear
distinction
between
an
element
of
an
offense,
which
you...
we
all
agree
cannot
be
changed,
and
a
kind
of...
let's
call
it...
a
corroborative
requirement
because
when
there
is
a
corroborative
requirement
there,
in
effect
what
the
law
says
is
you've
got
to
prove
something
extra.
you've
got
to
prove
that
there
is
a
corroborative
witness,
and
you
do
that
by
having
the
witness
come
in
and
say,
yes,
i
saw
it
or
i
saw
evidence
or
whatnot
of
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
a
clear
analytical
basis
for...
for
distinguishing
between
an
independent
corroboration
requirement
and
an
element.
am
i
missing
something?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's
right,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
goes
to
my
question.
whatever
the
corroboration
requirement
may
be,
it
seems
to
function
with
the
same
demand
that
an
independently
stated
element
would
have.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bernstein,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
