ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
law
such
as
article
3807
that
eliminates
a
requirement
of
victim
corroboration
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
because
it
does
not
expand
the
definition
of
the
crime
and
does
not
increase
the
punishment.
the
label
of
substantive
here
that
petitioner
attempts
to
place
on
the
law
is
not
useful.
it's
really
beside
the
point.
his
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
acquittal
is
not
dispositive.
in
collins,
the
court
overruled
kring
v.
missouri,
and
that
was
exactly
the
situation
in
that
case.
a
plea
to
a
second
degree
murder
conviction
stood
as
a
complete
acquittal
to
a
first
degree
murder
prosecution.
and
under
the
first
rule
in
effect
the
defendant
would
have
been
able
to
go
back
and
be
acquitted
of
first
degree
murder.
yet,
that
law
was
changed
and
originally
the
court
in
kring
held
that
that
violated
the
ex
post
facto
to
apply
it.
but
in
collins,
the
court
overruled
that
and
that
was
the
proper--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
i
have
to
say
i
think
that
label
is
also
unuseful.
unfortunately,
justice
kennedy,
this
change
in
the
law
only
went
to
one
manner
of
obtaining
a
conviction
here.
it
was
only
in
cases
in
which
victims
testified.
the
state
of
texas
could
still
prosecute
people
for...
under
the
aggravated
sexual
assault
through
other
evidence
when
victims
didn't
testify.
this
just
went
to,
i
think
as
the
attorney
general
of
texas
properly
stated,
a...
the
history
of
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
credibility
of
these
witnesses,
and
there
were
two
ways
in
which
sufficient
credibility
could
have
been
introduced
to
permit
admissibility
for
this
testimony
to
go
to
the
jury.
one
was
outcry
and
one
was
corroboration.
and
to
look
at
both
of
those
under
state
laws
are
very
instructive.
the
outcry
evidence,
for
example,
if
the
child
had
told
her
mother
within
6
months
or
a
year,
depending
on
which
law
applied,
would
come
before
the
jury
not
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
it
was
excluded
as
hearsay
for
that
purpose.
it
only
came
in
as
evidence
that
she
told
someone.
so,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
so
did
kring,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
it
would
not.
we
don't
believe
that
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
aimed
at
letting
people
conduct
their
affairs
in
accordance
with
law.
when
a
person
commits
an
act
that
they
believe
is
not
criminal,
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
then
prosecute
that
person
later
for
that
act.
that's
what
the...
the
clause
was
aimed
at.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
also
it
does
not
increase
the
punishment.
i
think
the
chief
justice--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--oh,
we
don't
think
so
at
all.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
not
reliance,
your
honor.
it's
the
unfairness
of
prosecuting
someone
after
the
fact
for
something
that
was
in
fact
not
a
crime
at
the
time
they
committed
it.
that
is
different--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
the
point
is,
as
the
chief
justice
made
before
and
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
collins,
in
fact,
that
the
difference
between,
for
example,
1
year
or
20
years
is
comparable
to
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
the
difference
is,
justice
scalia,
it
changes
the
legal
consequences
of
the
conduct.
when
that
conduct
was
committed,
there
was
certain
legal
consequences
at
that
point
in
time.
what
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
aimed
at
is
later
changing
that
and
applying
it
to
that
person
who
acted
at
that
point
in
time.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
changes
the
legal
consequences.
these
rules
do
not
change
the
legal
consequences.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but,
your
honor,
the
concern
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
was
not
with
people
relying
on
something
so
they
could
get
away
with
a
crime.
it
was--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
think
that
point
that
you
make
go
to
other
perhaps
due
process
concerns
or
other
provisions
of
other
constitutional
provisions
that...
as
collins
made
clear,
that's
not
what
the
ex
post
facto
clause
was
about.
and
in
fact,
in
overruling
thompson
v.
utah,
the
court
was
quite
clear
to
say
there
may
still
be
some
sixth
amendment
problem,
although
because
of
development
of
sixth
amendment
law
in
jury
trials,
that's
probably
not.
but
there
could
be
some
other
constitutional
issue,
but
it's
not
an
ex
post
facto
problem.
and
your
honor
brings
up
treason.
i
just
wanted
to
address
that
since
there
were
several
questions
earlier
also.
there's
a
opinion
by
the
court
in
1945,
the
kramer
case,
that
i
think
is
the
most
useful
place
to
look
for
the
treason
law
under
the
constitutional
provision.
and
it
makes
quite
clear
there
that
there
are
three
elements
for
that
offense,
but
the
two-witness
rule
is
a
procedural
means.
it
talks
about
how
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
were
concerned
about
making
it
difficult
to
establish
treason
for
obvious
reasons.
and
one
way
they
did
it
was
by
increasing
the
elements
from
the
common
law.
they
included
not
just
an
overt
act
requirement
but
also...
they
added
an
overt
act
requirement
in
addition
to
the
elements
of
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
and
adherence
to
the
enemy.
in
addition,
they
established
a
procedural
rule
of
two-witness.
but
the
ex
post
facto
clause
would
only
be
violated
if
the
criminal
prohibition
was
later
expanded;
that
is,
the
elements
of
the
offense
were
expanded
or
the
punishment
was
increased.
that's
what
the
core
concerns
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
were
and
we
don't
believe
that
they
would
be
violated
in
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
looking
in
historical
context,
it
appears
to
have
been
aimed
at
the
situation
of
a
bill
of
attainder,
and
some
bill
of
attainders
are
ex
post
facto
clauses...
may
have
an
ex
post
facto
effect.
in
sir
john
fenwick's
case,
that
bill
of
attainder
also
had
an
ex
post
facto
effect
to
the
extent
that
it
did
not
apply
the
evidentiary
rule
then
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
bill.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
there's
an
overlap
between
bill
of--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--because
not
all
bill
of
attainders
are
ex
post
facto.
you
can
have
a
bill
of
attainder--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
justice
chase's
opinion...
his
sole
opinion,
it
should
be
pointed
out...
he
was
talking
about
what
the
term
of
ex
post
facto
could
mean
and
talked
about
how
broad
it
could
be
and
then
was
trying
to
narrow
it
down
to
give
it
content.
and
when
he
listed
the
categories
of
laws
it
would
include
in
that,
it
would
include
bill
of
attainders
that
were
ex
post
facto.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
i
think
that
wasn't
what
justice
chase
was
doing.
he
wasn't
delineating
the
distinction
between
the
two.
he
was
trying
to
give
content
to
the
ex
post
facto
provision
in
acknowledging
that
that
was
a
type
of
ex
post
facto
law.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
may
i
answer?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
under
texas
law,
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out,
the
corroborating
evidence
is
not
to
the
elements
of
the
offense.
it
only
has
to
be
some
evidence--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
it
really
goes
to
credibility
of
the
witness,
and
the
structure
of
the
texas
law
really
reinforces
that,
particularly
with
the
outcry
requirement.
it's
going
to
the
credibility
of
that
witness
testimony
that
is
being--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--thank
you,
your
honor.
