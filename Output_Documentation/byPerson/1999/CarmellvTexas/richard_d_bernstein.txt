mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
effectively
asked
this
court
to
uphold,
for
the
first
time
in
its
history,
a
retroactive
change
in
the
substantive
criminal
law.
and
both
collins,
497
u.s.
at
45,
and
miller,
482
u.s.
at
433
and
434,
indicate
that
the
court
has
never
and
should
never
approve
a
retroactive
change
in
the
criminal
law.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
i
think
both
precedent
and
history
indicate
that
it's
a
change
in
the
substantive
law.
the
statute
itself,
which
appears
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
is
a
statute
about,
quote...
about
when,
quote,
a
conviction
is
supportable,
closed
quote.
so,
it
is
clearly,
by
its
own
terms,
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
statute
and
not
a
mere
evidentiary
rule.
km
was
capable
of
testifying
before
the
change
in
the
statute
and
after
the
change
in
the
statute.
the
question
was
whether
her
testimony
was
sufficient
by
itself.
there's
perhaps
no
more--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--i...
i
don't
believe--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
was
any
more
a
witness
competency
change
than
the
change
in
fenwick's
case,
which
is
what
calder's
fourth
category
referred
to.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--well,
as
hopt
makes
clear,
it
four
times
distinguishes
changes
in
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
from
changes
in
evidentiary
rules.
all
that
was
changed
in
hopt
was
an
evidentiary
rule,
who
could
testify.
the
rule--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--yes.
hopt
was
and
this
is
not.
in
texas,
a
5-year-old
can
testify
and
is
sufficient
by
themselves
under
the
old
statute,
as
well
as
under
the
new
statute.
one
would
not
suggest
that
a
14-year-old
is
less
competent
than
a
5-year-old.
the
rule
goes
to
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
every
bit
as
much
as
the
rule
of
two
witnesses
for
treason
in
fenwick's
case
went
to
sufficiency.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i...
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
the
witness
competency
cases
went
to
whether
the
person
could
testify
at
all,
not
whether
the
testimony
had
to
be
corroborated.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i
would
call
that
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule.
and
in...
and
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
footnotes
we
cite
a
lower
court
case
which
reversed,
based
on
calder's
fourth
category,
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
sure.
the
rule
stated
in
calder's
fourth
category
is
broader
than
simply
a
change
from
a
two-witness
rule
to
a
one-witness
rule.
it
is
a
change
in
any
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule
so
that
less
evidence
is--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
you
do
need
a
second
witness
here
in
that
some
form
of
corroboration--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--well,
the...
there's
a
split
in
the
texas
courts
as
to
whether
you
need
an
eye
witness.
two
courts
suggest
you
need
an
eye
witness,
and
three
courts--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--yes.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
yes,
but
even
that
requires
a
second
witness.
it
requires
the
second
witness
to
come
in
and
confirm
that
the
outcry
has
been
made.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
right.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
so,
under
the
old
rule,
the
testimony
of
km
was
not
sufficient
by
itself.
you
needed
at
least
somebody
else
to
come
in
and
corroborate
whatever
corroboration
means
under
texas
law--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--or
to
come
in
and
testify
that
there
was
a
timely
outcry.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
we
believe
the
corroboration
issue,
for
purposes
of
this
court,
has
been
waived.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
corroboration
was
not
argued
below
by
the
state
of
texas,
and
calder
v.
kentucky
would
indicate
that
when
an
argument
has
not
been
raised
below,
the
respondent
cannot
raise
it
here.
it
was
also
not
raised
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--there
are
two
texas
cases
that
indicate
eye
witness
corroboration
is
required.
so,
if
those
were
the
texas
rule,
that
would
not
be
sufficient.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
under
other
texas
cases,
that
would
be.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
presumably
the
defendant
is
an
eye
witness.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
i
think
the
principal
reason
it's
not
good
enough
is
because
the
issue
was
not
waived
below.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
it...
it
might
well
be
good
enough.
there
is
a
split
in
the
texas
courts,
and
that
particular
situation
has
not
been
presented.
and
in
addition,
there
were
many
counts
alleged
here,
and
that...
that
note
wouldn't
necessarily
go
to
these
four
counts,
as
opposed
to
the
more
recent
counts
which
do
not
fall
within
the
ex
post
facto
challenge.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
hopt
has
made
clear,
as
did
collins
in
a
footnote,
that
mere
changes
in
evidentiary
rules
do
not
fall
within
calder's
fourth
category.
that
would
not...
the
situation
you
described
would
not
be
a
change
in
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule.
it
would
just
be
a
change
in...
in
what
evidence
could
be
admitted.
it
would
also
be
like
thompson
v.
missouri
in
that
regard,
which
admitted
documents
which
had
not...
which
would
not
have
been
authenticatable
under
the
prior
rule.
admittedly,
the
distinction
here
is
a
fine
one
between
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
on
the
one
hand,
which
is
substantive,
which
we
submit
cannot
be
changed
retroactively,
and
evidentiary
rules
on
the
other
hand.
but
it
is
a
distinction
recognized
in
every
pertinent
body
of
the
law.
it's
recognized
in
erie
where
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
substantive,
but
evidentiary
rules
themselves
are
only
procedural.
it's
recognized
in
conflicts
of
law,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
restatement
second,
conflicts
of
law,
section
133
and
134,
comments
b
to
each,
where
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
recognized
as
substantive.
and
it's...
this
distinction
between
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
evidence
is
also
recognized
in
double
jeopardy
law
in
this
court's
leading
opinion
in
lockhart
v.
nelson.
this
court
has
never
suggested,
in
either
the
civil
or
the
criminal
context,
that
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
procedural
and
not
substantive.
and
it
is
substantive
because
it
is
intertwined,
inextricably
intertwined,
with
the
very
question
of
guilt.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
the
fenwick's
defenders...
and
we
submitted
yesterday
a
lodging
of
relevant
pages
of
the
debate
in
fenwick's
case...
specifically
took
the
position
that
a
change
in
the
required
number
of
witnesses
was
a
substantive
change
equivalent
to
a
change
in
the
offense
itself
and
specifically
said
that
such
a
change
in
the
minimum
amount
of
proof
was
an
ex
post
facto
change.
essentially...
it's
interesting...
303
years
later,
we're
having
the
same
argument
here
that
the
english
parliament
had
in
1696
because
the
arguments
raised
by
my
colleagues
from
texas
that
a
change
in
the...
in
the
minimum
amount
of
proof
is
simply
procedural
and
simply
a
matter
of
form
were
made
by
fenwick's
accusers.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
no.
i
think...
it
was
a
bill
of
attainder,
but
it
was--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--it
was
a
bill
of
attainder,
but
it
was
also
an
ex
post
facto
situation.
and
the
debates
that
we
provided
the
court
with
yesterday
in
the
lodging
make
that
clear,
particularly
on
pages
255
and
256,
262,
282,
and
283,
312,
and
320.
they
say,
the
defenders
of
fenwick...
the
accusers
of
fenwick
took
the
state
of
texas'
position,
but
the
defenders
of
fenwick,
who
i
think
the
court
of
history
has
sided
with
and
who
certainly
calder
and
justice
story
sided
with
in
his
commentaries
on
the
constitution...
the
defenders
of
fenwick
said
changing
the
minimum
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
a
substantive
change
and
is
equivalent
to
making
a
new
crime,
is
equivalent
to
changing
the
offense.
and
that
makes
sense
from
a
policy
reason
as
well
because
one
of
the
key
policies
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
to
keep
the
legislature
out
of
the
business
of
adjudication.
and
there's
nothing
that
the
legislature
could
do
to
more
put
its
thumb
on
the
scale
than
to
change
the
standard
for
determining
guilt.
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
one
other
case.
in
miller
v.
florida,
the
issue
there
was
the
standard
for
determining
sentence.
the
defendant
in
that
case
could
have
gotten
the
exact
same
sentence
under
the
old
statute.
the
only
thing
that
changed
was
the
legislature
put
its
thumb
on
the
scale
and
said,
we're
going
to
make
it
easier
to
give
the
longer
sentence.
but
the
longer
sentence--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--well,
but
the
same
would
have
been
true
in
fenwick's
case.
the
single
witness
was
recognized
as
not
fully
competent
by
himself
to
sustain
a
conviction.
and
i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
the
old
law
may
well
have
been
outmoded,
stereotypical,
and
a
very
bad
policy
choice.
but
the
point
is
it
was
wrong
as
a
substantive
policy
choice.
and
what
ex
post
facto
law
teaches
is
when
a
legislature
changes
its
substantive
policy
choices,
it
must
change
them
prospectively
and
not
retrospectively.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i
think
it
is
more
than
labeling
because
it
is
the
rule
here.
it
was
the
rule
on
adjudication
of
guilt.
it
was
the
standard.
a...
to
quote
the
statute,
a
conviction
is
not
supportable
absent
both
the
victim
testifying
and
either
corroboration
or
outcry.
that's
different
than
an
evidentiary
rule.
if
it
were
just
an
evidentiary
rule
and
there
were
an
error
on
appeal,
you
would
have
a
retrial.
under
this
rule,
if
there
is
insufficient
evidence
because
there
was
no
corroboration
or
outcry,
you
have
acquittal,
which
is
another
example
of
a
substantive
difference
versus
just
a
procedural
difference.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
right.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
is
supportable
only
if.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
it
says
if
the
victim
informed
any
person,
other
than
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
statute
says,
a
conviction
is
supportable
on
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
the
victim
of
the
sexual
offense
if
the
victim
informed
any
other
person
within
6
months.
i
would
submit
that
is
substantively
indistinguishable
from
a
statute
that
says
that
a
conviction
is
supportable
only
if
there's
corroboration
or
outcry
in
addition
to
the
victim
testifying.
and
to
return
to
the
judicial
function
versus
the
legislative
function--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--sure.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
absolutely.
if
this...
under
the
old
statute,
if
there
had
been
a
second
witness,
ready
to
testify,
just
like
in
fenwick's
case,
and
that
witness
got
waylaid
or
didn't
make
it
to
the
court,
the
court
wouldn't
say,
well,
this
witness
is
incompetent.
the
court
would
say,
we
have
insufficient
evidence
and
we
must
dismiss.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
there
is
still
a
corroboration
or
outcry
requirement
for
those
above
18.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
it's--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
right.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i...
i
think
there
is
no
competency
rationale
for
that.
the
notion
that
a
5-year-old
is
more
competent
than
a
25-year-old
or
a
35-year-old
makes
no
sense.
so,
the
statute
clearly
is
not
a
competency
statute.
it
is
a
statute
about
when
do...
when
does
the
legislature
have
sufficient
confidence
that
there
is
minimally
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
someone.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
when
the...
when
the
victim
under
the
current
statute
is
below--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--18,
yes.
and
there
are
many
states
that
have
eliminated
corroboration
for
victims
over
18.
i
mean,
the...
but
i
think
that
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
calder's
fourth
category
is
a
bright
line
rule.
i
think
the...
the
greatest
value
of
the
four
calder
categories
is
that
they
are
bright
line
rules.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i
don't
think
it
is
difficult
to
draw
the
line.
i
think,
as
i
mentioned
in
those
four
or
five
areas
of
law,
all
those
areas
have
treated
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
substantive,
and
evidentiary
rules
only,
such
as
justice
ginsburg's
example,
as
procedural.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
even
texas--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--well,
even
texas
in
their
brief
said
at
page
18,
i
believe,
that
this
is
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule.
and
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule.
failure
to
satisfy
the
rule
requires
acquittal,
not
a
new
trial.
failure
to
satisfy
an
evidentiary
rule
requires
a
new
trial.
failure
to
satisfy
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule
requires
acquittal.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
under
the
new
statute,
18
is
the
dividing
line.
under
the
old
statute--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--under
the
old
statute,
but
even
now
under
the
new
statute,
the
younger
the
victim
is,
the
more
power
that
one
witness'
testimony
has.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
that's
the
rule
in
texas
that
an
evidentiary
error
only
requires
a
new
trial
and
not
an
acquittal,
and
it's
also
the
rule--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--well,
actually
this
court
has
a
double
jeopardy
precedent
exactly
on
point,
lockhart
v.
nelson,
which
holds
that
in
that
circumstance
where
there
is
an
evidentiary
error
and
the
remainder
of
the
evidence
is
by
itself--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--insufficient,
new
trial.
not...
not...
it
does
not
violate
double
jeopardy
to
have
a
new
trial
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
no,
because
under
texas
law...
and
we
cite
these
cases
in
our
brief,
both
our
opening
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
under
the...
both
the
old
statute
and
the
new
statute,
when
it's
not
satisfied,
the...
the
required
remedy
is
acquittal
and
the
required
remedy
on
appeal,
when
it's
ruled
it's
not
satisfied,
is
remand
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
so,
it
is
not
treated
as
merely
an
evidentiary
error
under
texas
law.
they
don't
send
it
back
and
say,
now
let's
see
if
you
can
come
up
with
your
second
witness.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
yes,
13.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
only
four
of
those
counts.
some
of
those
counts...
some
of
the
other
nine
counts
were
before
the
victim
had
an
age
under
14
and
so
did
not
need
corroboration
or
outcry
under...
under
either
statute,
and
some
of
the
later
counts
are
after
the
statutory
change.
there
may
be
an
argument
on
remand
about
whether
overruling
the
four
counts
here
has
some
spill-over
effect
on
those
counts,
but
that
was
not
sought
by
the
petition
and
that's
not
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i...
i
think
three
purposes.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
well,
i
think,
as
i
said,
the
ex
post
facto
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
always
recognized
this
substantive
versus
procedure
distinction.
i
won't
belabor
that.
the
second--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--i
think
collins
was
addressing
something
else.
a
number
of
earlier
cases
had
suggested
that
procedural
rules,
if
they
provided
substantial
protection...
in
other
words,
a
lot
of
protection,
if
they
helped
a
lot,
if
they
worked
a
lot
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant...
were
not
covered
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
but
the
court
in
collins,
i
believe
at
page
45,
made
clear
that
substantive
rules...
and
i
realize
the
two
words
are
close,
substantive
and
substantial...
are...
are
in
a
different
category
than
procedural
rules
that
help
a
lot.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
yes.
in
addition,
to
the
substantive
versus
procedure
distinction,
which
i
think
is
important--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--sure.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i
think
we
are
trying
in
this
case
to
protect
the
system
from
the
legislature
putting
its
thumb
on
the
ultimate
adjudication
of
guilt
for
past
conduct.
obviously,
they
can
put
their
thumb
on
the
adjudication
of
guilt
prospectively.
they
can
define--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--this
is--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--this
is
a
very
unsympathetic
case,
i
would
agree,
based
on
the
findings
below.
but
the
ex
post
facto
jurisprudence
of
this
court
indicates
it
doesn't
matter
how
unsympathetic
the
case
is.
it
doesn't
matter
how
bad
the
old
rule
was.
both
story
and
harlan,
in
quotes
we
have
in
our
brief,
say
that.
if
you
recognize
a
bad
crime
or
a
bad
man
or
a
bad,
old
rule
exception
to
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
you
might
as
well
lift
the
clause
out
of
the
constitution
because
the
legislature
always
believes
it's
changing
a
bad
rule
for
a
good
rule,
and
the
legislature
always
believes
that
its
substantive
changes--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--it
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
one
of
the
important
concerns
is
reliance,
and
it
is
also
correct
that
we
do
not
raise
a
reliance
argument.
but
as
miller
v.
florida
and
weaver
make
clear,
reliance
is
not
the
only
concern.
this
concern
about
separation
of
legislative
and
judicial
functions
is
cited
in
both
miller
v.
florida
and
weaver
v.
graham,
and
it
traces
actually
back
to
calder,
which
mentions
on
page
389
this
concern
that
we
do
not
want
legislatures
changing
the
ultimate
standard
for
adjudicating
guilt
for
past
offenses
any
more
than
we
wanted
legislatures
changing
the
ultimate
standard
for
determining
the
sentence
in
miller
v.
florida
for
past
offenses.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
there's
no
indication
that
they
wanted
to
get
carmell,
but
i
believe
that
the
clause
and
the
purpose
of
the
clause,
especially
as
rephrased
by
justice
story,
goes
to
a
change
in
a
rule
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that...
that
category
four
is
not
limited
to
attainder
cases.
and
i
think
the
citations
that
we
gave
to
fenwick's
debates...
to
the
debates
in
fenwick's
case
show
that
fenwick's
defenders
made
the
additional
argument
that
chase
was
right
to
view
that
as
an
ex
post
facto
case.
they
made
the
additional
argument
that
the
change
in
the
rule
itself,
separate
and
apart
from
the
attainder
considerations,
was
a
legislative
practice
that
should
not
happen,
and
we
think
that
was
adopted
into
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
but
fenwick
didn't--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--but
fenwick
didn't
know
that
he
had
a
defense.
he
apparently
committed
his
treasonous
act
in
front
of
two
witnesses.
he
just
caused
the
second
witness
to
abscond.
in
fact,
in
fenwick
they
had
an
out-of-court
declaration
from
the
second
witness.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
i
don't--
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
--i
don't
think
it
went
to
reliance
and
there's
no
indication
of
a
reliance
interest
in
the
debates
in
parliament
in
fenwick's
case.
i
think
it
went
to
a
legislative
determination
that
this
is
such
a
serious
offense
that
we
need
a
heightened
amount
of
evidence.
now,
as
i
say,
legislatures
can
change
that
determination,
but
calder's
fourth
category
and
the
debates
in
fenwick
and
justice
story
would
indicate
that
they
can't
change
it
retroactively.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
d.
bernstein
justice
souter,
the
point
you
were
making
is
exactly
the
point
that
fenwick's
defenders
made
in
the
lodging
that
we
filed
yesterday.
and
they
made
exactly
the
point
that
they
viewed
changing
the
minimum
evidence
as
akin
to
changing
the
crime
itself,
as
akin
to
changing
the
elements.
justice
stevens,
i
think
you're
correct
that
this
rule
could
be
limited
to
crime-specific
minimum
standards
of
evidence.
fenwick
itself
was
a
crime-specific
treason
minimum
standard
of
evidence,
and
in
the...
in
the
restatement
second,
conflicts
of
law,
minimum
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
civil
area...
that's
for
a
particular
class
of
cases...
is
described
as
the
clearest
case
where
it's
substantive,
where...
where
it
would
be
a
more
generalized
rule
in
the
civil
context
like,
you
know,
a
variation
of
how
to
say
preponderance.
that
would
not
necessarily
be
substantive
in
that
context.
justice
kennedy,
the
citations
for
requiring
acquittal
under
texas
law
are
at
page
19,
note
10
of
our
reply
brief,
although
i
think
the
same
would
be
required
under
the
lockhart
case
which
is
a
federal
case,
488
u.s.
3340
to
42.
also,
collins
itself
makes
clear
that
whether
a
rule
is
substantive
or
procedural
for
purposes
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
a
federal
question.
that's
at
page
45
of
collins.
justice
scalia
and
chief
justice
rehnquist,
on
this
20
years
versus
1
year
on
category
three,
go
back
to
miller.
miller
was
a
case
where
the
defendant
could
have
gotten
the
exact,
same
sentence,
and
the
change
in
the
standard
by
which
you
decided
what
sentence
to
give
was
considered
an
ex
post
facto
change.
this
is
a
change
in
the
standard
by
which
you
decide
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
and
i
think
would
even
more
clearly
fit
within
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
beazell
is
even
stronger
for
us
than
the
quotation
you
read.
beazell
also
describes,
as
in
law,
different
than
the
joint
trial
rule
in
beazell,
a
law
that
would
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
would
be
a
change
in
a
law
concerning,
quote,
the
quantum
and
kind
of
proof
required
to
establish
guilt
and
all
questions
which
may
be
considered
by
the
court
and
jury
in
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
and
that's
quoted
at
pages
9
and
10
of
our
reply
brief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
