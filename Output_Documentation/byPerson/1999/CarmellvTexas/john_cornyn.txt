mr.
john
cornyn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
texas
respectfully
submits
that
this
court
cannot
reverse
carmell's
convictions
at
issue
here
today
consistent
with
collins
v.
youngblood,
which
this
court
decided
just
9
years
ago.
as
the
court
noted
in
collins,
the
language
in
category
four
of
the
calder
formulation
by
justice
chase
was
not
intended
to
prohibit
application
of
new
evidentiary
rules
in
trials
for
crimes
committed
before
the
changes,
citing
this
court's
decision
in
hopt
and
in
thompson
v.
missouri.
indeed,
in
1925
when
this
court
was
confronted
in
beazell
with
a
ex
post
facto
case,
it
omitted
entirely
the
fourth
category
in
the
calder
formulation.
mr.
john
cornyn
justice
scalia,
i
believe
this
is
equivalent
to
the
court's
decision
in
hopt
where
previously
the
testimony
of
convicted
felons
was
not
permitted
to
support
a
conviction
and
then
later
that...
that
was
taken
away.
so,
it
was--
mr.
john
cornyn
--as
i
understand
this
court's...
this
court's
writings,
the
only
sufficiency
rule
that's
of
constitutional
dimension
would
be
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
cornyn
it
would
result
in
an
acquittal.
yes,
sir,
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
cornyn
well,
we
would
suggest
that
you
can...
we...
the
same
problem
i
think
that...
that
counsel
and
i
and
the
court
perhaps
are
struggling
with
over
whether
this
is
a
competency
or
sufficiency
rule
is
the
same
problem
the
court
has
had
and...
and
counsel
have
had
over
the
years
dealing
with
whether
mere
procedural
changes
are
excepted
from
the
ex
post
facto
rule.
mr.
john
cornyn
we
do
believe
it
is
a
sufficiency
rule
but
not
one
of
constitutional
significance.
mr.
john
cornyn
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
john
cornyn
--the
only--
mr.
john
cornyn
--under
the
ex
post--
mr.
john
cornyn
--we
believe
that--
mr.
john
cornyn
--excuse
me.
justice
breyer,
we
believe
that's
now...
that
sort
of
protection
provided
to
an
accused
in
the
criminal
case
is
now
provided
under
the
due
process
clause
under
this
court's
decision
in
re
winship
that
the...
assuring
a
criminal
defendant
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
john
cornyn
in
the...
in
the
case
of
sir
john
fenwick?
mr.
john
cornyn
we
believe
that
would
be
a...
a
sufficiency
rule
and
really
no
different
than
if
the
court...
excuse
me...
the
legislature
decided
to
change
the
rules
allowing
the
admission
of
the
hearsay,
certain
kinds
of
hearsay
evidence.
certainly
under
a
previous
rule
that
would
exclude
that
evidence,
if
the
legislature
or
the
court...
and
depending
on
the
jurisdiction...
decided
to
promulgate
a
new
rule
which
allowed
the
admission
of
what
heretofore
had
been
hearsay
evidence
which
would--
mr.
john
cornyn
--no,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
valid
distinction
in
the
sense
that
one
would
be
prohibited
and
one
would
be
allowed.
we
believe
all
changes
in
the
rules
of
evidence
would
be
allowed,
as
this
court
said
in
collins.
indeed,
although
i'm
not
aware
this
court
has
ever
had
occasion
to
decide,
under
an
ex
post
facto
challenge,
the
specific
validity
of
federal
rule
412,
the
federal
rape-shield
rule,
413
allowing
for
evidence
of
similar
crimes
in
sexual
assault
cases,
and
rule
414
providing
for
evidence
of
similar
crimes
in
child
molestation
cases,
we
think
that
those
kinds
of
rules,
which
have
been
indeed
upheld
as
against
an
ex
post
facto
challenge
by
lower
courts,
would
certainly
be
permitted
under
this
court's
rulings
and
particularly
under
the...
under
the
collins
decision.
mr.
john
cornyn
well,
only
in
the
sense--
mr.
john
cornyn
--yes...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
cornyn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
cornyn
we
believe--
mr.
john
cornyn
--we
believe
in
either
of
those
cases,
whether
you
label
it
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question
or
an
incompetency
question
as
the
court
has
cited
in
hopt,
that
they
would
not
violate...
those
kinds
of
changes
would
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
has
never
struck
down
a
legislative
enactment
as
violative
of
the
fourth
category
in
justice
chase's
calder
formulation.
and
in
fact,
over
the
years,
as
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
rule
in
ex
post
facto
cases,
it
has,
as
i
said,
in
beazell
omitted
the
fourth
category
entirely
in
1925,
and
then
of
course,
in
this
court's
decision
in
collins,
not
only
made
the
ex
post
facto
clause's
coverage
more
succinct
as
covering
only
alterations
in
the
definition
of
crime
or
in
the
increases
in
punishment,
but
explicitly
said
that
changes
in
the
rules
of
evidence
should
not
be
banned
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
john
cornyn
well,
we
do
believe,
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
that
this
did
operate
in
a...
in
a
general
manner
that
was
permitted
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
none
of
the
core
concerns
that
animated
the
founders'
adoption
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
as
it
applies
to
the
states--
mr.
john
cornyn
--justice
stevens,
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
court
overruled
kring
and
collins,
as
it
did
thompson
v.
utah,
represents
a
contraction
or
at
least,
if
not
a
contraction,
a
more
succinct
statement
of
the
coverage
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
which
we
believe
is
more
faithful
to
the
original
understanding
of
the
framers,
as
the
court
stated
in...
in
beazell.
none
of
the
core
concerns
which
animated
the
founders'
adoption
with
ex
post
facto
law-making
are
present
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
cornyn
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia,
that
that
would
not
serve
a...
a
reliance
interest,
but
it
would...
it
would
concern
the
vindictive
law-making
aspect.
mr.
john
cornyn
well,
i
believe
that
would
be
prohibited
under--
mr.
john
cornyn
--perhaps,
your
honor.
it's
hard
to
imagine,
but
perhaps.
certainly
the
elements
of
the
crime,
as
defined
by
the
legislature
and
as
is
present
here,
have
not
changed.
the
facts
required
for
the
prosecutor
to
prove
in
order
to
obtain
a
conviction
were
exactly
the
same.
the
only
requirement
of
the
texas...
of
the
texas
statute
under
some
circumstances
is
that
there
be
corroboration.
and,
of
course,
out
of
the
15
counts
of
the
indictment,
upon
which
mr.
carmell
was
convicted,
we're
talking
about
4
here
which
occurred
during
a
period
of
time
after
she
turned
14.
mr.
john
cornyn
i
do
not...
i
do
not
believe
that
we
lose
under
those
circumstances.
indeed,
lower
courts
have
certainly
confronted
that
in
dealing
with,
for
example,
the
rape-shield
laws
in
interpreting
this
court's
decisions
in
hopt,
thompson
v.
missouri,
have
said
that
that
is
not
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
under,
of
course,
the
court's
decision
in
hopt,
where
previously
convicted
felons
could
not
testify
and
then
could
testify,
that
sort
of
more
ready
admission
of
evidence
to
support
a
conviction
was
found--
mr.
john
cornyn
--i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
it
really
relates
to
the
mode
of
trial
and
the
sort
of
practices
that
this
court
has
typically
called
procedural,
that
is,
what
evidence
is
going
to
be
admitted,
the
sort
of
changes
that
the
court
has
certainly
approved,
which
is
labeled
procedural,
which
have
operated
to
the
distinct
disadvantage
of
criminal
defendants
in
daubert
in
1977
involving
a
change
in
the
death
sentencing
procedures,
mallet
v.
north
carolina
where
the
court
upheld
a
change
in
the
law
which
permitted
the
state
to
appeal
which
it
had
not
been...
had
that
right
previously.
of
course,
in
beazell
where
felons
were
required
to
be
tried
separately
and
then...
and
thereafter
were
allowed
to
be
tried
jointly,
all
of...
all
of
these
cases,
collins,
which
allows
the
appellate
court
to
reform
an
unauthorized
verdict...
all
of
those
have
operated
to
the
distinct
disadvantage
of
the
defendant,
but
have
been
labeled
procedural
rules
which
affect
the
mode
of
the
proceedings
and
do
not
go
to
core
concerns
that
the
framers
sought
to
protect
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
john
cornyn
i
believe
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
cornyn
i
don't
believe
we
would
lose
in
that...
in
that
case.
i
think
this
is
really
more...
and
if
i
understand
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
question
is
whether
if...
if
the
change
in
the
rule
allows
more
evidence
to
be
admitted
than
had
heretofore
been
allowed,
this
court
has
already
answered
the
question
in...
certainly
in
the
hopt
case
and
in
thompson
v.
missouri
where
it
says
the
fact
that
more
evidence
is
allowed,
or
conversely
in
the
rape-shield
context
lower
courts
have
said
the
fact
that
less
evidence
is
allowed
in
terms
of
questioning
the
reputation
of
a...
of
a
complaining
witness--
mr.
john
cornyn
--justice
scalia,
i...
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
what
we're
talking
about
here
and,
say,
a
change
in
the
hearsay
rules,
such
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
which
would
exclude
certain
testimony
that
would
have
been
required
for
a
conviction
which--
mr.
john
cornyn
--well,
we...
justice
stevens,
we
disagree
with...
with
the
amicus,
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers,
which
suggests
the
fact
that
it's
case
dispositive
in
the
sense
that
in
one
case
you
get
an
acquittal;
one,
you
get
a
conviction.
mr.
john
cornyn
perhaps
a
more
significant
distinction
that
i
should
make
is
the
fact
that
under
texas
law
corroboration
need
not
duplicate
the
testimony
with
regard
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
but
only
tend
to
connect
the
accused
with
the
crime.
so,
it
need
not,
in
that
sense,
be
more
evidence
from
the
standpoint
of
bolstering
the
testimony,
but
really
i
think
relates
to
the
historical
skepticism
with
which
the
testimony
of
a...
a
child
sex
abuse
victim
has
been...
has
been
considered.
mr.
john
cornyn
i
believe
it
is
and--
mr.
john
cornyn
--it
could
only,
justice
scalia,
represent
some
anomaly
of...
of
texas
law
and
some
difference
in
treatment
of
the
lack
of
evidence
under
texas
law
as
opposed
to
other
jurisdictions--
mr.
john
cornyn
--well,
no,
no.
the...
our
characterization
of
this
law
is
that
it...
that
it
is
procedural.
it
is
an
evidentiary
rule
change
and
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
and
so,
to
the
extent
the
court
would
defer
to
the
interpretation
of
the
state,
insofar
as
the...
the
coverage
of
its
rule,
then...
then
we
would
suggest
that
the
conviction
should
be
upheld.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
for
all
these
reasons
we
would
ask
the
convictions
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
