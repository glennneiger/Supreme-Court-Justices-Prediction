98-7540,
carmell
versus
texas
on
behalf
of
justice
stevens
who
wrote
for
the
court.
this
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
texas.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
15
counts
of
various
sexual
offenses.
under
a
texas
statute
a
so-called
outcry
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
conduct,
a
conviction
could
not
be
sustained
on
the
victim’s
testimony
alone
unless
the
victim
had
told
someone
about
the
offense
within
six
months
of
the
crime.
this
is
the
so-called
outcry,
or
unless
the
victim
was
under
14-years-old
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
in
1993,
texas
amended
that
statute
to
permit
a
conviction
solely
on
the
victim’s
testimony
if
the
victim
was
under
18
years
of
age.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
all
accounts.
he
appealed
his
convictions
arguing
that
the
state
had
based
its
case
on
the
victim’s
testimony
alone.
yet
the
victim
had
not
made
a
timely
outcry
nor
was
she
under
14-years-old
at
that
time.
the
texas
court
of
appeals
rejected
petitioner’s
argument
holding
his
convictions
could
be
sustaining
under
the
1993
amendment
to
the
statute
because
the
victim
fell
within
the
new
18-year-old
age
requirement.
it
further
held
that
retrospectively
applying
the
amendment
to
offenses
committed
before
its
enactment
did
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
prohibition
in
the
constitution.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
division
among
lower
courts
as
to
whether
these
kinds
of
laws
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
the
court
reverses.
in
calder
v.
bull
justice
chase
explained
that
the
phrase
ex
post
facto
laws
refers
to
four
types
of
criminal
laws,
among
them
laws
that
receive
less
or
different
testimony
then
the
law
required
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
in
order
to
convict
the
offender.
here,
because
the
victim
was
not
under
14
years
of
age
and
had
not
made
a
timely
outcry,
the
old
texas
law
in
place
at
the
time
petitioner
committed
his
offenses
required
the
victim’s
testimony
plus
other
corroborating
evidence
in
order
to
convict
him.
the
new
texas
law
however,
permitted
the
petitioner
to
be
convicted
on
the
victim’s
testimony
alone.
the
court
holds
that
such
a
law
receives
less
testimony
than
the
law
required
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
in
order
to
convict
the
offender.
accordingly,
the
court
concludes
that
convicting
petitioner
under
the
amended
texas
law
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
therefore
reverses
the
judgment
below.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
i
have
joined.
