justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
suggestion
here
that
the
respondent
can
show
cause
and
prejudice
for
the
procedural
default
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
really
thought,
counsel,
that
murray
v.
carrier
indicates
that
the...
that
if
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
was
procedurally
defaulted,
that
the
court
can't
go
on
and
reach
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claim.
i
mean,
that
seemed
clear
to
me
from
murray,
and
what's
been
omitted
is
a
determination
about
whether
the
ineffective
assistance
claim
was
procedurally
defaulted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
hasn't
been
reviewed,
as
has
been
pointed
out
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
don't
see
how
the
sixth
circuit
judgment
can
stand
in
light
of
murray
v.
carrier.
