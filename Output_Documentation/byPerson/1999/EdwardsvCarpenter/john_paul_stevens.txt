justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
the
first
question
is,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
we
don't
have
a
statutory
problem
in
this
case
at
all,
as
we
do
in
the
preceding
case.
this
is
basically
a
refinement
on
the
doctrine
that
originated
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion.
it's
a
judge-made
rule
that
we
have
to
answer,
so
we
can...
we
have
our
own
decision
to
make,
rather
than
asking
what
congress
intended.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
second
question
is,
the
underlying
claim
here,
am
i
correct
in
saying
that
the
failure
to
put
in
any
evidence,
other
than
the
statements
of
the
prosecutors
that
supported
a
guilty
plea,
that
the
absence
of
witness
testimony,
is
that
just
a
state
law
requirement
or
is
this
a
federal
constitutional
requirement
that
there
had
to
be
something
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
but
is
there...
if
i
can
just
try
to...
is
there
a
state
law
requirement
that
was
perhaps
missed
in
this
case
that
you
only
get
to
because
it's...
you
know,
for
all
these
procedural
reasons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
actual
testimony,
to
take
a
guilty
plea
in
a
case
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim?
the
basis
for
it,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
counsel
just
challenged
a
30-year
sentence
as
opposed
to
a
20-year
sentence,
and
failed
to
challenge
the
entire
guilty
plea
on
the
ground
that
the...
no
evidence
was
put
in.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
had
he
done
what
you
say
he
should
have
done
and
prevailed,
then
your
client
would
have
been
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
he
only
was...
eliminated
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty
by
reason
of
the
agreement
with
the
state
that
enabled
him
to
make
this
plea,
and
that
if
you
set
aside
the
plea,
that
would
have
put
everything
back
to
square
1.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
he
avoided
all
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--by
the
deal
that
he
made,
and
it
seems
to
me...
and
you're
telling
me
that,
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
if
you
prevail
he
would
not
be
exposed
to
the
death
penalty
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
a
general
answer,
but
what
happened
in
this
case?
if
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
are
vitiated
and
you
start
over
again,
you're
telling
me
that
there's
something
else
happened
that
would
make
him
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
counsel
might
well,
even
if
he
had
a
valid
reason
for
attacking
the
plea
arrangement,
it
might
have
been
a
very
sound
strategy,
just
as
it
was
in
the
initial
plea
agreement,
not
to
do
that,
because
he
wouldn't
want
to
risk
the
death
penalty
for
his
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
appointment
of
counsel?
he's
now
represented
by
the
ohio
public
defender's
office.
you're
a
member
of
that
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
he
also
represented
by
your
office
in
the
plea
negotiations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
do...
that
county
public
defender
does
appellate
work
as
well
as
trial
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
when
he
got
new
counsel
for
appeal,
was
that
a
different
lawyer
within
the
franklin
county
public
defender's
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
presumably
there
would
be...
those
lawyers
would
talk
to
one
another.
it
isn't
as
though
a
complete
new
stranger
came
into
the
case.
there'd
be
some...
because
they
share
their
files,
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
so
at
least
it's
conceivable
that
whatever
motivated
the
trial
counsel
to
enter
into
the
plea
negotiation
might
also
have
motivated
the
appellate
counsel
not
to
challenge
the
plea
negotiation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
should
treat
them
as
different
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
under
the
sixth
circuit's
view,
if
i
understand
it,
there
would
have
to
be
established
that
it
was
a
federal
constitutional
violation
of
the
plea
agreement,
not
merely
that
it
violated
ohio
law.
