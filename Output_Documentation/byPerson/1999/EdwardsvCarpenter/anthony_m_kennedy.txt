justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
one
way,
then,
to
state
the
difference
between
the
parties
in
this
case
that
the
difference
is
one
of
the
definition
of
exhaustion,
that
he...
that
the
respondent
concedes
there
has
to
be
exhaustion,
but
he
defines
it
just
in
terms
of
presentment,
whereas
you
agree
there
has
to
be
exhaustion,
but
you
say
exhaustion
must
be
a
proper
presentment.
is
that
the
issue
in
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
recognize
there
can
be
procedural
defaults
that
are
not
exhaustion.
procedural
defaults
is
the
larger
category.
exhaustion
is
a
subclass
of
procedural
default,
as
i
understand
your
position,
and
that
exhaustion
means
proper
exhaustion,
not
mere
presentment.
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
this
case
could
we
resolve
the
case
in
your
favor
by
saying
that
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
exhaustion
as
a
subset
of
different
kinds
of
procedural
defaults,
and
that
the
exhaustion
here
was
not
complied
with
because
there
was
not
proper
presentment
of
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
and
maybe
you
have
a
different
theory
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
you
would
agree
with
the
respondent
that
exhaustion
is
satisfied
if
there's
mere
presentment,
even
though
it
hasn't
been
properly
exhausted,
and
you
would
say
it's
something
other
than
exhaustion.
you're
telling
me,
please
don't
use
exhaustion
as
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
my
favor.
use
procedural
default
as
some
broader
classification.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
you'd
be
pleased
with
a
judgment
in
your
favor
under
any
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
is
the
theory
that
you
think
is
the
proper
one
for
us
to
adopt
in
this
regard?
