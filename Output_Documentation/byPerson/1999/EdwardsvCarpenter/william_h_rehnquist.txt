chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-2060,
ronald
edwards
v.
robert
carpenter.
mr.
foley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
foley,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
that
there
was
not
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
for
the
state
court
ruling,
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
didn't
pass
on
that.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that...
if
we
were
to
reverse
on
your
point,
that
would
be
open
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
respondent
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
foley,
do
you
know
whether
respondent,
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari,
made
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
foley.
mr.
bodine,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
an
ohio
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
footnote
bear
on
the
question
presented
here,
mr.
bodine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on
it.
are
you
asking
us
to
pass
on
it
in
the
alternative?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
raised
that
question
in
the
sixth
circuit
and...
as
i
understand
it,
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
no,
you
don't
need
to
show...
you
don't
need
to
show
the
cause
here
for
this
kind
of
claim,
and
that's
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
another
reason
for
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
question
presented
that
we
granted
certiorari
on
isn't
adequately
presented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
suggest
you
pass
on
to
your
next
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
stewart
v.
lagrand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
office,
mr.
bodine,
is
a
state
public
defender?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
how
did
you
happen
to
pick
up
this
case?
i...
just
as
a...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bodine.
mr.
foley,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
foley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-2060,
edwards
against
carpenter,
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
