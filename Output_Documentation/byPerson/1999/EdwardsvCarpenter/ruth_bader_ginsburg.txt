ruth
bader

mr.
foley,
may
i
ask
you
to
back
up,
because
as
i
understand
justice
breyer's
question,
you
have
already
said
the
district
court
ground
is
not
the
issue
before
us
now
and
that,
indeed,
if
we
reverse
on
the
ground
on
which
the
sixth
circuit
rested,
that
would
be
wide
open,
that
the
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
ruled
were
never
passed
on
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
they
would
be
open
to
be
considered
on
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
should
focus
only
on
what
the
sixth
circuit
ruled,
because
the
district
court's
ruling
would
be
open
for
review
by
the
sixth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
point
out
exactly
where
the
sixth
circuit
did
that,
because
i
don't
recall
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
answer
that
it's
not
implicated
here,
because
one
of
the
striking
things
about
this
case
is
the
difference
in
the
bottom
line,
that
the
district
court
was
just
going
to
send
it
back
to
have
another
direct
appeal,
but
the
sixth
circuit
said
no,
you
go
all
the
way
back
to
square
1.
you
have
a
new
culpability
hearing.
a
new
culpability
hearing
implies
that
you
wipe
out
the
former
one,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what
justice
stevens
was
suggesting,
that
the
prosecutor
could
say,
fine,
you've
wiped
out
the
prior
culpability
hearing,
no
plea.
