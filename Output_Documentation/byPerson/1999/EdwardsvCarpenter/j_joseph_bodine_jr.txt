mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
robert
carpenter's
appellate
ineffectiveness
claim
is
not
procedurally
defaulted.
he
presented
it
to
the
ohio
courts
in
the
manner
in
which
he
is
entitled
to
under
ohio
rule
of
appellate
procedure
26(b).
he
presented
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
at
the
district
court
proceedings
in
federal
habeas
mr.
carpenter
alleged
that
rule
26(b)
was
inadequate
and,
in
the
alternative,
he
argued
that
if
it
was
adequate--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
rule
26(b)
is
the
process
by
which
ohio
defendants
must
challenge
their
appellate
counsel's
ineffectiveness.
mr.
carpenter
specifically
challenged
that
rule
at
the
district
court
proceedings,
saying
that
it
was
inadequate,
but
he
argued
in
the
alternative
that,
if
that
rule
was
adequate
and
could
effectuate
the
default
of
his
appellate
ineffectiveness
claim,
he
could
present
cause
in
prejudice
for
that
default.
the
warden
did
not
defend
rule
26(b)
at
the
district
court,
and
never
responded
to
the
cause
in
prejudice
arguments.
those
are
the
same
cause
in
prejudice
arguments
the
warden
now
asks
this
court
to
force
mr.
carpenter
to
present.
the
district
court
agreed
with
mr.
carpenter
that
rule
26
is
inadequate
because
the
good
cause
provision
has
not
been
consistently
applied
by
the
ohio
courts.
the
district
court
also
determined
that
mr.
carpenter
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
that
he
was
prejudiced
because
of
that,
and
accordingly
the
district
court
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
on
appeal
before
the
sixth
circuit,
the
circuit
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
rule
26(b)
but
indicated
in
dicta
that
it
likely
agreed
that
the
rule
was
inadequate.
the
sixth
circuit
then
agreed
that
mr.
carpenter
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--your
honor,
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's
in
a
footnote
11
at
page
64.
i'm
sorry.
footnote
13,
your
honor,
on
page
65
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
sixth
circuit
stated
in
that
footnote
that
it
wasn't
going
to
reach
the
merits
of
rule
26(b),
but
that
it
likely
agreed
that
the
rule
was
inadequate
because
the
good
cause
provision
has
not
been
consistently
applied.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
it
bears
on
the
question
presented
here,
your
honor,
because
unless
the
rule
is
adequate--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
question
that
was
presented
here
is
whether
a
procedurally
defaulted
claim
may
nevertheless
be
used
as
cause
to
excuse
the
default
of
a
different
merit
claim.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
there
has
been
no
federal
finding
in
any
court
that
mr.
carpenter's
appellate
ineffectiveness
claim
is
procedurally
defaulted,
and
our
argument
is,
until
there
is
a
cognizable
procedural
default,
mr.
carpenter
need
not
present
cause
in
prejudice
arguments.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
whether
a
procedurally
defaulted
claim
may
nevertheless
be
used
as
cause.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
there's
another
reason,
though.
even
if
this
court--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--another
reason
the
question
is
inadequately
presented
here,
your
honor,
is
because
mr.
carpenter
has--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--that's
our
first
argument.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
it
means
that
there's
no
controversy
in
the
case.
mr.
carpenter
has
already
done
everything
the
state
is
asking
him
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
the
second
argument
that
we're
asserting
is
that
the
procedural
default
argument
should
not
be
applied
to
cause
arguments.
cause
arguments
have
always
been
used
to
explain
a
procedural
default,
and
in
that
context
this
court
has
always
been
focusing
on
merit
claims.
all
of
this
court's
authority
only
applies
to
procedural
default
doctrine
to
merit
claims.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
stewart
v.
lagrand,
as
we
note
in
the
merit
brief,
your
honor,
was
a
case
about
waiver.
mr.
lagrand
waived
both
his
merit
claim
and
his
cause
argument,
and
therefore
there
was
technically
nothing
for
this
court
to
review.
at
the
tail
end
of
stewart
v.
lagrand
this
court
did
note
that
the
cause
argument
was
procedurally
defaulted,
but
it
was
an
alternative
holding.
if
there
were
no
merit
claims
and
no
cause
arguments
presented
to
this
court,
the
court
never
could
have
reached
that
issue.
just
last
term,
though,
in
strickler
v.
greene,
the
court
dealt
with
a
similar
structural
argument
with
respect
to
a
defaulted
brady
claim,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
a
defaulted
brady
claim
and
a
defaulted
cause
argument
could
nevertheless
be
considered,
even
though
the
cause
arguments
themselves
were
not
properly
presented
to
a
state
court.
the
same
analysis
should
apply
here.
mr.
carpenter
presented
his
claims.
he
presented
his
cause
claims,
fully
exhausted
them,
and
did
not
procedurally
default
them.
it
is
immaterial
at
that
point
whether
or
not
he
must
present
cause
in
prejudice
arguments
if
his
cause
argument
itself,
the
second
one,
is
not
procedurally
defaulted.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
a
question
earlier
about
the
perpetual
abyss
that
we
can
get
into
with
respect
to
these
questions.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
dealt
with
in
strickler
v.
greene.
no
matter
how
many
times
that
question
was
asked,
the
answer
to
why
was
the
brady
claim
defaulted
was
always
the
same
answer:
because
the
state
withheld
evidence.
there's
only
one
way
to
get
out
of
that
loop.
either
go
to
the
merits
of
that
claim,
or
continue
asking
the
question.
we
assert,
or
argue,
that
this
court
did
the
correct
thing
by
not
continually
asking
cause
questions
when
the
court
can
go
straight
to
the
merits
of
the
claim
and
resolve
it
at
that
point.
now,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
very
similar
to
a
brady
claim,
because
those
claims
both
ask
two
fundamental
questions:
is
there
state
conduct
that
must
be
attributed
to
the
individual
petitioner
and,
if
so,
has
the
petitioner
been
prejudiced
because
of
that
state
conduct?
if
a
brady
claim
can
be
reached
even
though
the
cause
arguments
are
themselves
defaulted,
then
so
should
an
ineffectiveness
claim
be
reached
when
the
answer
is
always
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
i
want
to
note
two
other
points
in
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor,
although
the
district
court
did
hold
that
there
was
no
default.
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--by
the
sixth
circuit,
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
if
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
then
the
adequacy
of
the
rule
certainly
would
need
to
be
resolved,
but
murray
v.
carrier
does
say
that
before
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
can
be
asserted
as
cause
it
need
be
presented
to
the
state
court,
it
need
rise
to
a
level
of
sixth
amendment
violation,
and
an
individual
need
be
prejudiced
by
it.
murray
v.
carrier
does
not
say
that
the
procedural
default
doctrine
applies
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
it's
our
position
that
an
individual
only
need
exhaust
that
claim,
or
present
it
to
the
state
courts,
before
he
can
use
it
as
cause
in
a
federal
habeas
proceeding,
but
mr.
carpenter
went
far
beyond
that.
he
didn't
merely
present
the
claim,
he
presented
it
to
two
separate
courts,
and
the
claim
is
not
procedurally
defaulted.
therefore,
he
should
be
permitted
to
exercise
that
cause
argument
with
respect
to
his
underlying
illegal
plea
argument.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carpenter
was
acquitted
of
the
death
penalty
because
in
ohio
you
cannot
plead
to
the
sentence
in
a
capital
case.
the
court
is
required
to
go
through
the
sentencing
phase
hearing,
which
is
a
judge
or
jury
trial,
depending
on
how
it
proceeds.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
honestly,
that's
how
we
get
around
the
problem
in
ohio.
you
can
plead
guilty
to
a
capital
offense
in
ohio,
but
the
court
cannot
impose
a
prearranged
sentencing,
or
set
a
penalty.
the
court
always
has
to
go
through
the
evidentiary
process
of
aggravating
circumstances,
the
mitigating
factors,
balance
them,
and
make
an
appropriate
determination.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
correct.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
under
ohio
law,
if
an
individual
goes
to
a
sentencing
phase
and
is
essentially
acquitted
of
the
death
penalty,
the
state
may
not
later
on
remand
charge
him,
but--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--if
we
were
in
that
position,
i
would
certainly
argue
that--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--the
sentencing
phase,
penalty
phase
proceeding
was
an
adjudication.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor,
and
as
i
said,
that
type
of
arrangement
is
how
the
courts
have
permitted
us
to
get
around
the
problem
with
pleading
guilty
to
a
capital
crime
and
then,
by
default,
pleading
guilty
to
the
death
penalty
itself.
but
again,
it's
not
implicated
here.
the
problem
with
that
culpability
hearing
was
that
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
presented
whatsoever--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--i
was
answering
a
different
question
i
think,
your
honor.
what
the
district
court
did
is,
it
stopped
short
in
its
analysis
and
granted
relief
on
the
ineffective
assistance,
and
thereby
required
a
new
appeal.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
district
court
should
have
gone
one
step
further
and
actually
granted
the
new
culpability
hearing.
now,
at
that
point,
i
agree
with
you,
the
question
whether
or
not
an
individual
can
then
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty
is
certainly...
well,
it
hasn't
been
resolved
in
this
case,
definitely.
ohio
law
would
support
the
fact
that
he
may
have
been
acquitted
of
the
death
penalty,
but
it
has
not
considered
it
in
the
context
of
a
guilty
plea
with
a
deal,
so
that--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--if
you
agreed
with
my
point
with
respect
to
the
cause
in
prejudice
argument,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
then
mr.
carpenter
has
proved
two
constitutional
claims
and
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
two
separate
claims.
the
bottom
line
in
your
question,
your
honor,
is
go
back
and
get
the
direct
appeal.
that
way,
you
don't
run
into
a
question
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
--what
the
sixth
circuit
said
is
that
the
violation
carried
with
it
due
process
implications,
because
ohio
has
established
a
procedure
to
protect
against
an
inappropriate
plea
to
a
capital
crime.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
federal
constitutional
violation
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
due
process
implications
that
a
state
has
set
up
a
procedure
that
an
individual
avails
himself
on
and
then
does
not
follow
that
procedure
properly.
under
that
circumstance,
the
sixth
circuit
held,
it
was
appropriate
to
go
back
to
have
a
full
culpability
hearing.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
on
those
two
particular
points
i
actually
agree,
because
in
this
case,
no
matter
how
many
times
the
question
is
asked
with
respect
to
what
is
cause
for
the
default,
it
is
always
the
ineffectiveness
of
mr.
carpenter's
original
appellate
counsel.
secondly,
we
also
agree,
and
we
argued
that
in
our
merit
brief,
it
is
only
the
constitutional
claims
themselves
that
have
to
be
presented
to
the
states.
if
it's
a
nonconstitutional
claim,
then
there's
no
requirement
that
that
cause
argument
be
presented
to
the
state.
so
in
the
earthquake
example,
that
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
claim.
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
the
state
system,
and
that's
the
difference
here.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
the
comity
doctrine,
the
interest
in
finality
that
a
state
has
always
asserted,
has
only
ever
revolved
around
constitutional
claims.
state
courts
have
an
obligation
to
apply
federal
constitutional
law.
therefore,
they
must
be
given
an
opportunity
in
the
first
instance
to
apply
it.
the
court
has
never
extended
it
beyond
that,
i
think
probably
to
accommodate
situations
like
that,
the
unforeseen
circumstance
that
would
deprive
an
individual
of
presenting
his
claim
fairly
to
the
ohio...
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
carpenter
presented
all
of
his
claims
to
the
ohio
courts
in
the
manner
in
which
he
was
permitted
to
do
so
under
ohio
law.
he
demonstrated
that
he
did
that
to
two
federal
courts.
he
demonstrated
that
the
procedural
default
of
his
underlying
merit
claim
could
be
excused
through
the
ineffective
assistance
of
his
appellate
counsel,
and
he
proved
to
two
federal
courts
that
he
was,
in
fact,
denied
the
ineffective
assistance
of
his
appellate
counsel.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
he
was
represented
by
a
different
public
defender
office.
in
ohio
we
have
several
different
public
defender-type
agencies.
mr.
carpenter
was
represented
by
the
franklin
county
public
defender,
which
does
exclusively
trial
work
and
appeal
work
stemming
from
that
county.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
for
franklin
county,
ohio.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
within
the
franklin
county,
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
addressed
that
issue
and
said
that
that
is
acceptable.
they're
technically
different
attorneys.
therefore,
one
may
raise
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
other.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
question
you're
getting
at,
is
it
essentially
the
same
individual
who
represented
him
through
that
direct
appeal
process.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
presumably,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
conceivably,
but
we're
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
ohio
law
certainly
does.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
we're
statewide,
your
honor,
and
what
we
do
is,
we
represent
individuals
in
counties
that
do
not
have
a
public
defender
system
set
up,
especially
in
those
smaller
counties
where
there
are
not
enough
appointed
counsel
to
represent
individuals.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
we
do
a
lot
of
outreach
training
and
try
to
provide
what
support
we
can,
your
honor.
mr.
carpenter's
former
counsel
had
worked
with
us
throughout
the
federal
court
proceedings
here,
and
when
the
case
was
granted,
mr.
belli,
who's
a
sole
practitioner,
simply
didn't
think
he
could
do
both.
that's
how
we
got
the
case.
mr.
j.
joseph
bodine,
jr.
if
your
honors
don't
have
any
other
questions,
thank
you.
