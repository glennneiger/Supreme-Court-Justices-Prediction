mr.
edward
b.
foley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
habeas
case
is
about
the
need
for
an
explanation
when
a
defendant
misses
his
opportunity
in
state
court
to
assert
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
in
order
to
reopen
his
original
direct
appeal.
the
sixth
circuit
here
held
that
no
such
explanation
is
necessary
before
a
federal
court
in
effect
may
reopen
the
appeal,
but
that
holding
is
serious
error,
because
it
undermines
the
state's
ability
to
have
the
reopened
appeal
occur
in
the
same
court
that
heard
the
original
appeal.
to
put
the
matter
more
concretely,
respondent
here
is
seeking
federal
habeas
relief
on
the
ground
that
his
guilty
plea
was
invalid
but
he
didn't
raise
that
claim
in
his
original
direct
appeal.
he
asserts
as
cause
for
that
default
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel,
but
he
defaults
in
his
ineffective
assistance
claim
as
well.
the
state
permits
a
defendant
to
raise
ineffective
assistance
in
order
to
revive
a
claim
originally
defaulted
on
direct
appeal,
here,
the
underlying
plea-related
claim,
but
respondent
did
not
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity
in
state
court
in
a
timely
manner
under
state
law,
and
our
position
is
that
his
failure
to
do
so
requires
an
explanation
before
the
federal
court
can
revive
that
defaulted
claim,
the
plea
claim.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
exactly.
we're
asking
this
court
to
reverse
on
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
and
it
may
remand
for
further
determination
on
the
adequacy
issue.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
we
don't
believe
so,
and
for
one
reason
is
that
he
had
a
lawyer
in
1992
in
a
time
in
which
he
could
have
raised
his
ineffective
assistance
claim,
so
we
don't
think
he
can
make
out
the
showing,
but
no
court
in
this
case
has
yet
entertained
the
cause
inquiry.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
no,
your
honor.
respondent
here
missed
multiple
opportunities
to
raise
his
ineffective
assistance
claim.
in
1991,
at
the
end
of
his
direct
appeal,
he
could
have
brought
that
claim
in
a
variety
of
forums,
but
he
didn't
bring
it
anywhere.
in
1992,
after
the
ohio
supreme
court
decided
that
murnahan
decision,
that
decision
makes
it
clear
how
to
bring
that
claim,
and
he
could
have
brought
it
in
1992,
after
that
decision,
and
he
had
counsel.
he
had
new
post-conviction
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
correct.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
correct.
respondent
makes
two
points
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
ground
that
was
not
passed
on
by
the
sixth
circuit.
one,
he
says
that's
an
obstacle
to
this
court
reaching
the
question
in
the
petitioner
for
certiorari,
and
that's
incorrect.
the
question
that
we
raised
in
the
cert
petition
is
properly
before
this
court.
it
was
the
question
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
it
was
the
question
that
respondent,
indeed,
asked
the
sixth
circuit
to
decide,
and
it
was
respondent's
view
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
you
didn't
need
to
address
the
adequacy
issue
and
instead
decide--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--i
do
know
the
answer
to
that,
and
respondent
did
not
object
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari
on
that
ground,
in
effect
recognizing
that
the
question
was
properly
presented,
suggesting
that
it
wasn't
worthy
of
the
court's
review.
so
to
answer
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
the
question
the
sixth
circuit
decided
is
properly
here.
now,
respondent
also
raises
the
adequacy
issue
as
an
alternative
ground.
our
view
is
that
that
should
be
remanded,
because
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
reach
it,
but
if
this
court
does
reach
that
issue
as
an
alternative
ground,
we
think
the
court
should
reject
it
as
without
merit
because,
as
i
was
suggesting,
for
two
reasons.
first,
he
had
multiple
opportunities
to
raise
his
ineffective
assistance
claim.
he
could
have
raised
it
at
three
different
times
in
3
different
years,
and
the
state
court
ground
was
that
he
missed
all
those
opportunities,
and
secondly,
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your
question
about
the
district
court's
reasoning,
the
district
court's
view
was
that
the
good
cause
standard
in
ohio
law
was,
there
was
some
variation--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--okay.
turning,
then,
to
the
question
that
the
sixth
circuit
decided,
our
position
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong,
because
the
state's
interest
here
is
to
have
the
plea
claim,
the
originally
defaulted
claim,
heard
in
the
forum
that
it
should
have
been
heard
in
the
first
place.
the
allegation
here
is
that
it
would
have
been
heard
in
that
forum
but
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
if
that's
true,
then
what
the
state
wants
to
do
is
to
rectify
that
constitutional
violation
by
restoring
that
plea
claim
to
the
forum
that
it
should
have
been
in
the
first
place,
but
the
sixth
circuit's
view
frustrates
the
state's
effort
to
get
that
claim
back
into
the
forum
in
which
it
belongs
if
the
federal
court
is
permitted
to
entertain
that
plea
claim
without
any
showing
of
why
the
defendant,
respondent
here,
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
state
court
opportunity.
the
state
has
a
process
for
raising
ineffectiveness
claims
to
reopen
a
direct
appeal,
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
does
is,
it
substitutes
the
federal
court
for
that
process.
it
makes
the
federal
court
engage
in
exactly
the
same
reopening
process,
because
as
the
federal
court
hear's
that
underlying
plea
claim,
and
does
so
because
it
finds
ineffective
assistance
is
cause,
then
the
federal
court
is
doing
precisely
what
the
state
court
wants
to
do,
and
the
state
court,
as
this
court's
precedents
make
clear,
the
state
needs
to
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
just
because
he
missed
the
state
court
deadline
means
that
he
gets
no
habeas
review
no
matter
what.
all
we're
asking
for
is
that
explanation,
the
cause
and
prejudice
test.
in
other
words,
it's
our
position
that
where
the
sixth
circuit
error
was
was
in
failing
to
run
this
claim
through
the
cause
and
prejudice
analysis
that
applies
in
all
procedural
default
contexts.
that's
what
coleman
says.
it
talks
about
the
uniformity
of
procedural
default
analysis,
and
that
uniformity
should
occur
in
this
context
as
well.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
we're
talking
about
the
three--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--several
responses,
justice
breyer.
first,
i
don't
think
we
have
an
infinite
regress
problem
here
because
we
only
have
two
steps.
we
have
two
defaults,
and
if
respondent
can
show
cause
for
that
second
default
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further.
he
does
get
habeas,
federal
habeas
relief
if
he
can
show
cause
and
prejudice
or
actual
innocence
under
the
test,
so
you
don't
have
to
look
for
a
third,
or
a
fourth,
or
an
infinite
regress.
now,
as
to
the
point
about,
well,
yes
it
is
true,
it
causes
a
federal
question,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
the
cause
inquiry
as
it
applies
to
that
underlying
plea
claim
is
a
federal
question,
but
he
has
asserted
ineffective
assistance
as
that
cause,
and
carrier
makes
it
plain
that
once
he
asserts
ineffective
assistance
as
the
cause
he
has
to
do
several
things.
first,
he
has
to
meet
the
sixth
amendment
standard
for
ineffective
assistance.
it
can't
simply
be
poor
lawyering
that
doesn't
meet
the
sixth
amendment.
and
secondly,
he
must
exhaust
that
sixth
amendment
claim
in
state
court.
so
carrier
already
tells
us
that
when
ineffectiveness
is
asserted
as
cause
we
have
to
go
back
into
the
state
system
and
it
is
not
sufficient...
to
answer
the
third
point
of
your
question,
it's
not
sufficient
simply
to
have
presentment
or
exhaustion
because,
as
this
court
recognized
unanimously
last
year
in
o'sullivan...
this
was
the
point
where
there
was
agreement
in
o'sullivan...
exhaustion
must
be
coupled
with
procedural
default
analysis,
and
the
reason
is,
as
this
court
explained,
is
that
procedural
default
doctrine
protects
the
integrity
of
the
exhaustion
rule.
so
once
carrier
says
that
this
ineffectiveness
claim,
the
sixth
amendment
claim,
the
second
part,
which
is
asserted
as
cause
for
the
underlying
plea
claim,
once
that
has
been
raised
it
has
to
go
back
to
state
court
not
just
for
presentment
but
for
proper
presentment,
and
that's
why
procedural
default
analysis
must
apply
to
both
claims,
the
plea
claim
and
the
ineffectiveness
claim.
the
sixth
circuit
held
to
the
contrary,
and
that's
why
it
was
erroneous.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
well,
we
definitely
believe
there
must
be
proper
presentment,
and
we
think
that's
the
procedural
default
requirement,
because
exhaustion
would
be
satisfied
if
a
state
like
missouri...
which
has
a
strict
90-day
deadline,
no
exceptions
whatsoever...
exhaustion
would
be
satisfied
on
day
91
no
matter
what
the
reason
for
the
default.
on
day
91,
we
know
as
a
matter
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
there's
no
further
state
remedy,
but
that's
not
proper
presentment,
and
that
doesn't
give
the
state
court
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
claim.
there
has
to
be
meaningful
opportunity.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
correct.
in
other
words,
he--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--i
think--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--no.
i
think
in
substance
we're
saying
exactly
the
same
thing.
i
think
my
terminology
might
be
slightly
different.
in
other
words,
i
would
reserve
the
word
exhaustion
for
simply
the
presentment
and
say
that
the
question
of
proper
presentment
is
what
the
default
doctrine
looks
to,
but
i
think
in
substance
we're
saying
that
a
default
occurred
here
because
it
was
time-barred
under
a
higher
law.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
well--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--absolutely.
[laughter]
mr.
edward
b.
foley
well,
i
think
in
my
view
it's
analytically
a
little
clearer
to
say
that
exhaustion
only
asks
for
whether
there's
been
presentment,
or,
alternatively,
it
would
be
futile
to
present,
because
the
court's
cases
do
say
that
exhaustion
is
technically
satisfied
if
you
can
look
to
a
rule,
like
the
missouri
rule,
and
you
know
that
it
would
be
absolutely
futile
to
present,
you've
satisfied
exhaustion.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
no.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
well,
i
think
if
i
understand
correctly
we're
only
saying
that
the
double
default
situation,
if
you
will,
the
need
to
have
two
causes
applies
in
a
situation
where
it
is
the
constitutional
claim,
and
all
we're
asking
for
in
this--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--correct.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
well,
carrier
answers
that
question.
carrier
itself
distinguishes
between
two
kinds
of
causes.
one
kind
is
where
it's
the
independent
constitutional
claim...
here,
the
sixth
amendment
claim...
and
carrier's
explicit
as
to
that
you
have
to
have
exhaustion.
as
to
the
earthquake
example,
carrier
itself
says
that
doesn't
require
exhaustion,
so
carrier
sets
up
this
analysis,
and
this
case
is
an
easy
one
under
carrier
because
it's
the
exact
same
claim.
it's
the
same
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
claim,
the
sixth
amendment.
so
if
there
are
difficult
cases,
given
the
line
that
carrier
draws,
this
case
isn't
one
of
them.
this
case
is
the
easy
case,
because
it's
the
same
case
as
carrier.
the
only
ruling
that
we're
asking
from
this
court
in
this
case
is
that
procedural
default
analysis
accompany
the
carrier
exhaustion
requirement.
carrier
exhaustion
requirement
already
exists,
and
to
reverse
the
sixth
circuit
is
simply
to
say
that
procedural
default
analysis
must
supplement
that
exhaustion
requirement,
and
the
reasoning
for
that
is
the
reasoning
that
this
court
has
always
said,
that
procedural
default
analysis
should
accompany
an
exhaustion
requirement.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
absolutely.
that's
our
exact
understanding.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
to
answer
that
question,
we
don't
think
there's
a
federal
constitutional
requirement.
we
don't
think
the
claim
has
merit
as
a
federal
claim,
but
we
do
think
that
federal
claim
has
been
asserted
in
this
case.
as
we
understand--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--i
want
to
answer
that
in--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--i'd
like
to
answer
that
in
a
couple
of
parts,
if
i
might.
first,
there
is
a
state
statute
that
does
call
for
witness
testimony
in
this
context,
but
our
understanding
of
ohio
law
is
that
there
can
be
a
waiver
of
that
requirement
of
sworn
testimony,
and
we
believe
that
waiver
occurred
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
so
we
don't
believe
that
there
was
a
violation
of
ohio
law.
we
also
think,
based
on
the
engle
case,
that
that
state
law
claim
cannot
be
independently
cognizable
in
federal
habeas.
mr.
edward
b.
foley
but
what's
been
presented
is
this
alternative
federal
alpha
derivative
claim.
just
to
say
one
more
point
about
the
state's
interest,
the
argument
here
is
that
the
state
doesn't
need
to
have
this
inquiry
take
place
in
state
court,
and
we
say
that
it
does,
because
again,
the
state's
interest
in
reopening
a
direct
appeal
is
as
strong
as
its
interest
in
the
appeal
itself.
in
other
words,
what
the
state's
process
here
is
trying
to
do
is
to
use
ineffective
assistance
as
a
vehicle
to
get
to
that
underlying
claim,
because
it's
the
underlying
claim
that
the
state
wants
to
reopen
and
have
heard,
and
it's
that
interest
that
we
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
not
respected,
and
for
that
reason
we
ask
that
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
be
reversed.
may
i
reserve
the--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
a
few
brief
points.
first
of
all,
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
one
of
your
questions,
the
ineffectiveness
claim
is
not
an
independent
basis
for
relief,
given
the
current
posture
that
the
case
is
in,
so
if
the
sixth
circuit
view
were
to
prevail
it
could
only
be...
the
only
habeas
relief
that
could
be
granted
would
be
on
the
plea
claim,
so
they
can't
assert
the
sixth
amendment
ineffectiveness
claim
without
proceeding
under
a
different
track,
because
under
the
sixth
circuit
track
only
the
plea
claim
is--
mr.
edward
b.
foley
--absolutely
correct,
and
also,
just
to
reiterate,
we
don't
want
to
concede
in
any
way
that
there
was
a
violation
of
ohio
law,
and
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
remanded
for
some
further
proceeding
on
this
waiver
issue,
so
we
want
to
preserve
that
point.
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
bodine
say...
make
the
argument
that
was
also
in
his
brief
that
exhaustion's
enough
in
the
ohio
context,
as
opposed
to
the
missouri
example
that
i
gave
you
where
there's
a
strict
90-day
deadline,
because...
well,
because
the
ohio
court
could
have
passed
on
the
claim
because
it
has
a
limited
narrow
safety
valve,
and
the
only
point
i'd
like
to
make
beyond
what's
in
our
brief
is
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
penalty
for
a
state
to
have
a
limited
safety
valve
of
that
kind
and,
indeed,
in
the
engle
case
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
this
court
explicitly
rejected
the
idea
that
cause
in
prejudice
analysis
does
not
apply
in
that
context.
the
same
kind
of
argument
was
made,
namely,
don't
do
cause
in
prejudice
analysis,
where
ohio
had
another
very
narrow
safety
valve,
and
this
court
explicitly
rejected
that
argument,
so
i
think
that
takes
care
of
that
issue
as
well.
mr.
bodine
mentioned
the
strickler
case,
the
brady
case,
as
an
example
where
a
constitutional
violation
can
be
its
own
cause.
that
is
true
in
the
brady
context,
and
it
may
in
some
fact
patterns
be
true
in
the
ineffective
assistance
context,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
again,
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
that
the
cause
inquiry
take
place,
and
there
may
be
an
example
in
a
different
case
where
you
can
use
ineffective
assistance
as
its
own
cause.
we
don't
think
that's
true
in
this
case
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
the
only
relief
we're
seeking
from
this
court
is
that
that
cause
inquiry
be
undertaken,
that
an
explanation
be
made.
and
finally
justice
breyer,
again,
as
to
the
distinction
between
the
earthquake
example
and
the
carrier
situation,
where
it's
a
constitutional
violation,
i
think
mr.
bodine
covered
this,
but
essentially
the
state's
interest
here
is
to
rectify
constitutional
error,
so
that's
why
it's
important
that
if
there's
an
allegation
that
ineffective
assistance
infected
the
original
state
appeal,
that
there
be
an
opportunity
for
the
state
to
correct
that
error
when
the
state
has
its
own
procedure
to
do
so,
as
it
does
here.
that
interest
doesn't
apply
in
the
earthquake
context,
and
so
all
we're
asking
is
that
when
a
defendant
doesn't
take
advantage
of
the
process
the
state
creates,
that
he
be
put
to
the
explanation
to
explain
why
he
didn't
take
the
advantage.
thank
you.
