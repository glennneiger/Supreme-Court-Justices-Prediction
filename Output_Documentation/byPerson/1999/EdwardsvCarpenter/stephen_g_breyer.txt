justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
with
his
claim
that,
look,
this
lawyer
on
appeal,
the
reason
that
i
didn't
file
my
request
on
time
there
is
because
the
ohio
statute
which
sets
up
a
procedure
whereby
an
appellate
court
reopens
a
matter
was
itself
very
confused
in
light
of
a
supreme
court
decision
which
suggests
for
this
class
of
case
you
didn't
use
that
procedure,
and
therefore
there
was
nothing
to
use,
and
that
whole
matter
wasn't
clarified
until
much
later
and,
in
respect
to
the
time
it
was
clarified,
my
thing
was
timely.
now,
that's
a
very
complicated
question,
but
i
guess
that's
what
the
district
court
went
on
here,
didn't
it,
and
anyway,
what
do
we
do
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
resolves
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
bothers
me
about
it
is,
i
mean,
it's
a
totally
logical
argument
that
you've
made
and
it
is,
state,
there's
a
constitutional
claim,
1)
blocked
by
state
ground,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
have
step
2.
you
can
get
around
the
state
ground
by
asserting
cause,
blocked
by
a
different
state
ground,
i.e.,
cause
wasn't
done
right,
and
i
suppose
you
could
have
cause
for
getting
around
state
ground
2,
which
could
be
blocked
by
state
ground
three.
they
didn't
do
that
one
right.
and
this
could
go
on,
like
kepler's
epicycles,
indefinitely
and
no
human
being,
let
alone
a
petitioner
without
any
lawyer,
would
ever
understand
what
to
do.
now,
the
reason
i
put
it
is,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
separate
and
different
way
to
look
at
it,
that
of
course
the
substantive
claim
can
be
blocked
by
a
state
ground
that's
adequate,
but
the
matter
of
cause
is
basically
a
question
for
the
federal
judge,
and
that
cuts
through
everything,
says
of
course,
with
carrier,
you
have
to
present
it
to
the
state
court
so
they
get
a
shot,
but
if
they
have
four
other
state
ground
rules
that
stop
it,
that's
their
problem.
the
matter
of
cause
for
getting
around...
the
matter
of,
is
there
a
state
ground
for
not
hearing
the
prosecutorial
claim,
that's
up
to
the
state,
but
the
matter
of
cause
for
getting
around
it,
that's
up
to
the
federal
judge,
basically.
now,
isn't
that
how
we
handle
most
matters
of
cause,
or
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
that,
if
i
agreed
with
you,
would
i...
is
there...
would
i
be
accepting...
would
i
have
to
accept
the
following:
there
is
a
constitutional
ground,
unfair
trial.
it's
blocked
by
an
adequate
state
ground,
and
now
the
defendant
asserts
cause.
there
are
many
kinds
of
cause.
this
kind
of
cause
happens
to
be
an
independent
constitutional
violation.
another
kind
could
be
an
earthquake
occurred
and
destroyed
all
the
papers.
a
third
kind
could
be
that
the
state
doesn't
apply
its
own
state
ground
fairly,
you
know.
that's
common.
a
fourth
kind
could
be
that
the
state
rule's
no
good
anyway
for
15
other
reasons.
now,
if
i
agree
with
you
that
they
have...
that
the
state
can
block
consideration
of
that
by
saying
you
didn't
apply
the
right
state
rules,
you
didn't
satisfy
the
state
requirements
for
raising
that
in
state
court,
that
applies
to
all
these
causes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
do
i
say
that?
how
do
i
say,
look,
you
say
the
reason
you
didn't
raise
your
constitutional
point
on
time.
why
not?
because
my
lawyer
was
inadequate,
and
that's
cause.
and
you
say,
you
have
to
make
that
claim
one
time
itself,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
suppose
my
claim
were,
because
the
courthouse
suffered
a
hurricane
and
all
the
documents
were
lost,
or
suppose
i
say,
because
the
state
itself
doesn't
apply
this
rule
fairly.
now,
why
isn't
it
equally
open
to
you
to
come
back
and
say,
but
you
have
to
make
that
claim
on
time?
now,
how
could
i
distinguish
them?
i'd
love
to
be
able
to
distinguish
them,
but
i
can't
think
of
a
way
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
then
agreed
with
you...
suppose
i
agreed
with
you
on
your
point
here.
what's
my
bottom
line
supposed
to
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
your
basic
claim,
i
take
it,
is
a
claim,
as
you
make
it,
that
the
federal
constitution
forbids
finding
a
person
guilty
on
the
basis
that
the
prosecutor
recites
the
facts,
and
he
doesn't
disagree.
i've
never
seen
a
federal
constitutional
case
that
said
that.
the
alternative
way
of
looking
at
your
basic
claim
is
that
the
lawyer
gave
him
ineffective
assistance
by
not
raising
that
very
point
on
appeal,
which
he
would
have
won
on
under
ohio
law,
but
then
we
run
into
what
justice
stevens
said,
which
is
bothering
me,
too,
so
what's
my
bottom
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
go
back
and
get
the
direct
appeal
under
ohio
law?
why
are
you...
i
can't
think
that
one
through.
help
me
on
that.
suppose
i
agree
with
you
on
your
cause
and
prejudice
claim.
then
what
do
i
say,
because
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
to
have
this
procedure
that
ohio
doesn't
like,
but...
you
know,
maybe
it's
a
violation
of
ohio
law,
but
if
it's
a
violation
of
ohio
law,
the
claim
becomes
one
of
ineffective
assistance
at
the
first
level,
and
i
don't
know
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
what
do
you
think
of
his
responses
to
the
two
things
that
were
worrying
me
on
your
cause
in
prejudice
point?
his
first
response
was...
of
course,
there
is
no
infinite
regress.
it's
possible
to...
but
he
says,
look,
it's
not
really
going
to
happen
that
you
have
cause
for
not
asserting
the
first
claim,
the
cause
was
defaulted,
and
then
you
try
to
assert
cause
there,
and
then
they
say
that
was
defaulted,
and
then
you
try
to
assault
cause
there
and
that
was
defaulted.
he
said,
that's
imaginary.
we're
only
talking
about
two
levels
here.
and
his
other
answer
was
not
bad.
he
said
that
this
applies
only
to
instances
where
the
cause
happens,
by
coincidence,
to
be
itself
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
because
that's
what
carrier
dealt
with,
so
don't
worry
about
suddenly
creating
this
kind
of
problem
with
all
the
other
more
common
causes
that
are
raised.
what's
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason
for
that
distinction?
