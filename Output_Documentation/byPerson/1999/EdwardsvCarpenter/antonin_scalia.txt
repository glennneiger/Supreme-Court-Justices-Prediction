justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
respondent
who
had
been
convicted
by
the
ohio
courts
of
aggravated
murder
and
aggravated
robbery
filed
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
contending
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conviction.
he
had
failed
to
raise
this
contention
on
the
direct
appeal
of
his
conviction
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals,
which
would
by
the
federal
habeas
action
unless
there
were
some
cause
for
that
default.
he
claimed
his
cause
that
he
had
had
a
constitutionally
ineffective
counsel.
the
problem
is
that
this
claim
also
had
been
defaulted
in
the
state
courts.
respondent
had
raised
it
in
an
application
to
reopen
his
direct
appeal,
but
the
application
had
been
filed
too
late
under
the
state’s
procedural
rules.
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
that
did
not
matter,
that
so
long
as
he
had
presented
his
ineffective
assistance
claim
to
the
state
courts,
it
was
of
no
relevance
whether
he
had
presented
it
in
compliance
with
the
state
court
procedures.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse
the
sixth
circuit.
it
is
the
general
rule,
when
a
federal
habeas
prisoner
asserts
a
claim
that
was
procedurally
defaulted
in
state
court,
the
federal
court
will
not
entertain
the
claim
unless
the
prisoner
can
demonstrate
cause
meaning
a
good
reason
for
his
state
court
default.
in
a
case
called
murray
versus
carrier
we
held
that
counsel's
ineffectiveness
in
failing
properly
to
present
a
claim
can
constitute
cause
excusing
the
procedural
default,
when
that
ineffectiveness
rises
to
the
level
of
the
constitutional
violation
of
failure
to
provide
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
but,
we
also
held
that
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
require
the
prisoner
to
have
exhausted
his
claim
of
ineffective-assistance
of
counsel
before
the
federal
court
would
consider
it
as
cause.
that
is
we
held
in
carrier
that
the
prisoner
must
have
presented
his
ineffective
assistance
claim
to
the
state
courts.
the
question
raised
by
the
present
case
is
whether
this
exhaustion
requirement
of
ineffective-assistance
asserted
as
cause
is
uniquely
immune
from
the
procedural-default
rule
that
accompanies
the
exhaustion
requirement
in
all
other
contexts.
whether,
in
other
words,
it
suffices
that
the
ineffective-assistance
claim
was
presented
to
the
state
courts,
even
though
it
was
not
presented
in
the
manner
that
state
law
requires.
that
is
not
a
hard
question.
an
affirmative
action
would
render
the
exhaustion
requirement
illusory.
as
we
recognized
just
last
term
in
a
case
called
o'sullivan
versus
boerckel,
the
procedural
default
doctrine
is
necessary
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
federal
exhaustion
rule.
the
purposes
of
the
exhaustion
requirement
would
be
utterly
defeated
if
the
prisoner
were
able
to
obtain
federal
habeas
review
simply
by
letting
the
time
run
so
that
state
remedies
were
no
longer
available
when
he
asked
for
them.
those
purposes
would
be
no
less
frustrated
were
we
to
allow
federal
review
to
a
prisoner
who
had
presented
his
claim
to
the
state
court,
but
in
such
a
manner
that
the
state
court
could
not,
consistent
with
its
own
procedural
rules,
have
entertained
it.
in
such
circumstances
it
could
hardly
be
said
as
comity
and
federalism
require
that
the
state
had
been
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
prisoner’s
claims.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
