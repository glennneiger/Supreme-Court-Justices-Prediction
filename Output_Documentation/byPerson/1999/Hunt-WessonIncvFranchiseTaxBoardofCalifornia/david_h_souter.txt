is
that
the
subject
of
that--
--go
on.
was
that
the
subject
of
sort
of
the
disagreement
as
to
whether
in
fact
under
the
california
scheme
you
are
supposed
to
deduct
the
nonbusiness
income
from...
interest
expense
from--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
say
they
just
don't
know,
what
you're
referring
to
is
the...
a
process
in
which
most
states
know
by
virtue
of
a
reasonable
apportionment
formula,
and
so
when
you
say,
well,
we
just
don't
know,
that
seems
to
be
the
equivalent
of
saying,
well,
we
can't
apportion,
but
you
clearly
can.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
don't
know
either,
and
instead
of
adopting
an
apportionment
formula,
what
you
in
effect
do
is
adopt
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
and
as
against
an
apportionment
formula,
which
provides
a
rational
basis,
and
an
irrebuttable
presumption
which
ignores
the
facts,
due
process
normally
requires
the
rational
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you
certainly
do
that.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does
if
there's
a
dollar-dollar
relationship
between
the
expense
and
the
income,
and
you're
in
effect
saying,
we
don't
care.
we
will
simply
assume
that,
and
we
will
assume
that
by
means
of
this
presumption,
and
due
process
requires
rationality,
not
irrebuttable
presumptions.
