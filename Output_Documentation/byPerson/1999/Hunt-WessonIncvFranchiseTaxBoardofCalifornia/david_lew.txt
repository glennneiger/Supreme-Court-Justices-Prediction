mr.
david
lew
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
issue
before
this
court
can
be
simply
stated,
and
that
is,
what
interest
expense
is
california
constitutionally
required
to
treat
as
a
tax
deduction?
as
this
court
has
held,
a
state
bears
no
constitutional
obligation
to
permit
a
taxpayer
to
take
a
deduction
for
an
expense
which
relates
to
income
which
that
state
is
barred
from
taxing.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
conceded
that
states
such
as
california
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
allocate
expenses
to
different
streams
of
income
and,
more
importantly,
concedes
that
states
have
the
authority
to
do
so
by
applying
formulas
that
assign
interest
expense
to
income
that
is
not
taxable
by
the
state
of
california.
the
petitioner's
narrow--
mr.
david
lew
--well,
the--
mr.
david
lew
--well,
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
what
california
is
trying
to
do
with
this
statute
is
basically
eliminate
a
double
tax
benefit
that
arises
whenever
a
corporation,
number
1,
incurs
debt,
and
there
is
therefore
interest
expense
generated
by
that
debt,
and
at
the
same
time
has
funds
invested
in
nontaxable
activities
which
produce
nontaxable
income.
the
problem
is
that
part
of
the
debt
either
directly
or
indirectly
is
used
to
support
the
nontaxable
activities.
mr.
david
lew
well,
what
the
statute
is
attempting
to
do,
justice
kennedy,
is
to
essentially
close
that
loophole
in
the
most
effective
way
possible.
mr.
david
lew
well,
the
theory
behind
doing
it
on
a
dollar
basis...
and
if
i
may
just
take
one
step
back.
the
formula
first
allocates
interest
expense
to...
against
the
corporation's
business
interest
income
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis.
mr.
david
lew
that's
correct.
all
of
it
is...
all
of
it
is
deductible.
mr.
david
lew
to
the
extent
that
any
remains,
that
is
allocated
also
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
against
the
corporation's
nonbusiness
income,
and
again
it's
intended
basically
to
eliminate
the
possibility
that
any
amount
of
that
interest
expense
which
is
related
to
the
generation
of
income
that's
not
taxable
by
the
state
of
california
is
used
by
the
corporation
to
reduce
its
california
tax
base.
mr.
david
lew
it's...
well,
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
it's
allocable
against
its
nonbusiness
interest
and
dividend
income.
that's
what
the
statute
calls
for.
mr.
david
lew
because
the
money
that
is
borrowed
basically
is...
can't...
is
used
to
free--
mr.
david
lew
--there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
proportional
approach,
your
honor,
except
that
it
doesn't
really
close
the
loophole.
mr.
david
lew
because
to
the
extent
that
less
than
$1
of
interest
expense
is
used
to
offset
a
dollar
of
nonbusiness
income,
there's
still
that
differential
that
exists.
mr.
david
lew
well--
mr.
david
lew
--the
assumption
is
that
it's
not
related,
and--
mr.
david
lew
--indirectly,
yes.
mr.
david
lew
well,
the
answer
is
that
you
just
don't
know
that,
and
what...
and
what
california
is
trying
to
do
is
to
prevent
any
of
that
interest
that
might
be
related
to
the
generation
of
income
that
it
cannot
tax
to
be
used
to
reduce
its
california
tax
base.
mr.
david
lew
well,
there's
no
problem,
constitutional
problem
with
apportionment.
i
mean,
that
is
one
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
for
sure,
but
to
the
extent
that
interest
in
fact
does
relate
to
nonbusiness,
or
nontaxable
income,
there's
still
that...
there's
still
that
possibility
that
a
portion
of
the
interest
expense
that
in
fact
relates
to
generation
of
nontaxable
income
is
going
to
be
applied
to
reduce
the
corporation's
california
taxes.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i
can
only
say
that
the
objective
of
the
state
is
to
attempt
to
eliminate
that
possibility
of
the
taxpayer
receiving
a
double
tax
benefit.
mr.
david
lew
and
toward
that
objective
it
seems
that
the
way
that
california
does
it
is
reasonable,
because
a
dollar-for-dollar
offset
of
interest
expense
and
interest
or
dividend
income
basically
returns
the
corporation
to
the
same
economic
position--
mr.
david
lew
--well,
you
know,
we
can't
say
that
it
does
or
it
doesn't.
that
is--
mr.
david
lew
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
economic
reality...
the
dollar-for-dollar
allocation
is
really
an
attempt
to
reflect
the
economic
reality
that
interest
income
is
the
economic
counterpart
to
interest
expense.
if
a
corporation
borrows
money--
mr.
david
lew
--that's--
mr.
david
lew
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i
think
that
if
the
court
accepts
the
notion
of
fungibility,
then
the
problem
is
being--
mr.
david
lew
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
lew
well...
well,
i
disagree
with
the
idea
that
it
is
being
taxed.
after
all,
the
formula
itself
allows
as
a
first
step
an
allocation
of
interest
expense
against
a
corporation's
business
interest
income,
so
to
the
extent
that
the
amount
of
business
interest
income
is...
swallows
up
the
entire
amount
of
the
expense,
then
all
of
it
is
allocated
to
reduce
the
corporation's
california
taxes.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i
think
it...
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
statute
applies
its
rules
in
a
fair
and
even-handed
way.
i
mean,
certainly
it
is
possible
under
california's
statute
for
a
corporation
to
come
out
better
than
it
would
under
a
proportional
approach,
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
has
to
be
understood,
that
the
statute
does
allocate
interest
expense
to
interest
income
and
dividend
income
in
a
fair
and
in
an
even-handed
basis.
in
fact,
the
first
step
of
the
statute
allocates
it
to
business
interest
income.
and
with
regard
to
the...
what
the
statute
does,
it
basically
shifts
those
deductions
which
it
considers
to
be
attributable
to
nontaxable
income
to
the...
it
attributes
it
to
the
income
which
is
then
taxed...
which
is
then
allowed
as
the
deduction
by
the
state
of
domicile
if,
in
fact,
that
state
utilizes
a
statutory
scheme
which
is
similar
to
california's.
now,
it
is
true
that
none
of
the
other
states
currently
adopt
such
a
provision,
but
under
this
court's
internal
consistency
analysis
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
that's
a
constitutionally
significant
point.
if
in
fact
it
were
the
case
that
all
of...
that
all
states
utilized
this
formula,
then
the
taxpayer
would
be
able
to
have
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
deductions
which
california
has
essentially
shifted
over
to
the
state
of
domicile
and
enjoy
a
reduction
in
its
nonbusiness
income
in
that
state.
it...
the
statute
simply
attempts
to
assign
interest
expense
to
its
proper
use
or
application,
and
it
does
so
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
against
its
business
income
and
against
the
corporation's
nonbusiness
income.
in
that
sense,
it
is
applied
even-handedly,
and
again,
those
deductions
would
be
available
to
the
corporation
in
the
state
of
domicile
under
a
consistent...
internal
consistency
analysis.
now,
as
i
said,
the
proportionality
approach
is
one
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem,
but
again
it
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
a
corporation
obtaining
a
tax
benefit
completely,
because
to
the
extent
that
less
than--
mr.
david
lew
--sure.
i
agree.
mr.
david
lew
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
tax
benefit
that
arises
when
a
corporation
incurs
debt,
is
able
to
write
off
the
interest
expense
from
that
debt,
and
at
the
same
time
use
that
debt,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
to
generate
income
which
california
is
not
permitted
to
tax.
that
is
the
double
tax
benefit
that
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
david
lew
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i
don't
agree
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
was...
that
is,
in
fact,
the
case.
if
the
court
is...
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
stipulation,
then
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
the
parties
stipulated.
if
the
parties
stipulated--
mr.
david
lew
--i'm
reading
from
joint
appendix
page
21,
stipulation
number
14.
i
believe
that
is
what
justice
o'connor
was--
mr.
david
lew
--it...
well--
mr.
david
lew
--well,
what...
again,
and
i
know
that
i've
said
this
before,
what
california
is
attempting
to
do
is
basically
ensure
that
none
of
the
interest
expense
was
used,
in
fact,
to
generate
income
which
california's
not
permitted
to
tax.
mr.
david
lew
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
your
question
completely,
your
honor,
but
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way.
i
think
that
the
argument...
the
criticisms
that
can
be
leveled
against
california's
statute
can
also
be
leveled
against
a
proportionality
approach
in
the
sense
that
a
certain
portion
of
interest
expense
is
being
allocated
to
nonbusiness,
nontaxable
income.
now,
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
amount
that
was
allocated
is
the
correct
amount,
but
it
does
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
corporation's
tax
in
the
state
of
california,
so
to
the
extent
that
that
can
be
viewed
as
an
indirect
taxation
of
nontaxable
income,
that
is
what
is
being
done
there,
and
that's
the
same
criticism
that's
being
made
in
our
case
as
well.
mr.
david
lew
well,
again...
same
argument,
your
honor,
and
that
i
think
is...
it's
a
reasonable
objective,
and
the
approach
that
it
takes
is
the
surest
way
of
closing
that
loophole.
mr.
david
lew
that's
correct.
mr.
david
lew
that's
correct.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
in
that
the
court,
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
it
does
not
result...
that
the
allocation
of
interest
expense
to
nontaxable
income
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
does
not
constitute
a
tax,
i
think
it's
still
applicable
here,
even
in
light
of
allied-signal
and
other
cases.
mr.
david
lew
that
is
my
understanding,
yes,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
dollar-for-dollar
allocation
allowed
under
certain
circumstances
in
the
federal
scheme.
mr.
david
lew
i
think
there's
a
basis
for
doing
that,
your
honor.
i
also
believe
that
in...
that
section
265
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
well
provides
for
a
dollar-for-dollar
offset
in
certain
situations.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i--
mr.
david
lew
--well--
mr.
david
lew
--right.
the
california
statute
is
definitely
not
a
tracing
rule.
it's
actually
just
an
assignment
rule,
and
it's
basically
based
on
the
idea
that
it's
extremely
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
trace
interest
expense
to
its
ultimate
use
or
application,
and
again
it's
just
based
on
the
idea
that
this
is
what...
california's
interest
in
trying
to
close
this
loophole.
that's
what
the
statute
is
trying
to
do,
and
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
that
constitutes
a
legitimate
state
objective,
i
think
it
certainly
accomplishes
that
goal,
and
it
does
so,
i
think,
in
a
fair
way
in
the
sense
that
it
does
allow
that
first
step
to
allocate
interest
expense
to...
on
the
basis
of
business
interest
income,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
remaining,
it
does
allocate
it
against
its
nonbusiness
income.
mr.
david
lew
well,
i
think
that
that
is...
that
is
one
way
to
go,
but
i
think
that's
also
subject
to
manipulation
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
david
lew
and
that's...
i
think
the
problem,
if
you're
trying
to
determine,
you
know,
a
corporation's
motive,
i
think
that's
just,
as
a
matter
of
tax
administration,
extremely
difficult
to
do,
and
it's
essentially
a
facts
and
circumstances
kind
of
test,
and
i
just
think
that
it's
extremely
difficult
to
administer
that
kind
of
test,
you
know,
especially
for
a
state
like
california.
that,
i
think,
is
what
the
problem
is,
and
that
is
why
there
is
this
statute,
which
essentially
eliminates
any
type
of
concept
of
motive
or,
you
know,
purpose,
and
just
says,
look,
if
you
have
interest
expense,
and
you
are
using
some
of
your
capital
to
generate
income
that
is
not
taxable
in
the
state
of
california,
that
there
is
the--
mr.
david
lew
--oh,
it's...
well,
interest
is
harder
to
allocate
than
other...
the
thing
about
interest
is
that
it
is
extremely
fungible,
i
guess
is
the
best
way
to
put
it,
and
you
can't--
mr.
david
lew
--i
believe
they
can
be
made
anywhere,
your
honor.
mr.
david
lew
yes.
i
think
it--
mr.
david
lew
--yes.
it
is
my
belief
that
that
could
probably
be
done
pursuant
to
other
california
regulatory
authority
which
allows
for
a
spreading
of
interest
expense
similar
to
the
method
that
has
been
endorsed
by
the
petitioner.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
necessarily
require
a...
the
enactment
of
a
new
statute.
i
don't
really
have
anything
else.
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
them.
other
than
that,
i'm
done.
