justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
you.
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
that
you
don't
have
a
good
case
in
the
other
part,
but
i
mean,
after
all,
it's
an
illinois
corporation.
i
take
it
if
they
allocate
all
of
the
interest
income
to
the
illinois
mongolian
sheep
farm,
that
illinois,
they'll
get
the
deduction
on
the
illinois
income
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know,
does
that
really
happen?
so
in
other
words
when
california
insists
that
the
tin
can
business
allocates
its
interest
income
to
its
mongolian
sheep
farm,
the...
illinois
will
not
allow
them
to
deduct
that
interest
expense
that
california
shifted
over
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
up...
what
i
keep--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is,
in
my
mind
i
imagine
a
tin
can
company
selling
all
over
the
united
states.
it
owns
a
mongolian
sheep
farm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now...
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you...
because
i'm
not
totally
familiar.
which
part
of
the
constitution
forbids
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
let's
assume
you're
completely
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
totally
irrational.
i
mean,
it's
completely
unfair.
they're
taxing
income
that
arises
in
other
places.
what
is...
what...
can
you
just
trace
through
for
1
second
what
the
argument
is
that
that
violates
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
there
will
be
cases
that
support
you,
but
i
mean,
what's
the
reasoning?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
prevents
california
from
taxing
income
from
mongolia,
or
illinois
or
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
is
it
that...
one
day
california
says,
you
know,
we're
taxing
people.
we
don't
want
to
be
fair,
and
what
we're
going
to
do
is,
we
are
going
to
tax
income
that
arises
in
illinois,
and
moreover,
it's
going
to
be
terrible,
because
companies
are
going
to
have
to
pay
more
tax
than
they
have
income.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
i
wondered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
the
due
process
clause
that
it
does
that--
--extraterritorial--
--because
it
takes
their
property
without
due
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
can
company
has
no
business
interest
income.
it's
not
in
the
lending
business.
it
sells
dollar
1
million
worth
of
cans
in
california.
it
happens
to
borrow
about
900,000
to
get
the
tin.
now,
what
conceivable
reason
does
california
have
to
allocate
that
900,000
that
they
used
to
buy
the
tin
for
the
cans
to
some
kind
of
income
it
has
from
the
sheep
farm
in
florida?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
you
don't
know.
maybe
they're
lying.
they
said
they
used
it
for
tin,
but
maybe
they're
not
telling
the
truth.
okay,
other
states
have
dealt
with
that
problem
by
saying,
since
we
can't
trust
anybody
here,
and
it's
hard
to
trace,
what
we'll
do
is,
we
will
proportionately
allocate.
if
you
have
a
million
coming
in
from
the
tin
business,
and
you
have
100,000
from
the
sheep
farm,
do
it
10
percent
to
the
sheep
farm,
90
percent
to
the
tin.
all
right.
now,
why...
what
possible
reason
is
it
for
not
taking
some
variation
on
that
theme?
of
course,
if
you
can
show
it
went
to
the
sheep
farm,
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
win.
but
where
you
just
don't
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
it
not
close
the
loophole?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure
there's
a
differential,
but
the
sheep
farm
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
lending.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
see
why
you
call
that
a
loophole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
oh,
you
mean
maybe
it
is
related?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
the
tin
is
really
related,
so
why
don't
you
allocate
all
the
deduction
for
the
tin
to
the
sheep,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
what
that...
i
mean,
most
businesses,
except
if
they're
in
the
financial
business,
don't
have
a
lot
of
business
interest
income
compared
to
their
other
business,
so
i
don't
think
that
helps
too
much,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
ask
the
state
to
do
more
than
it
can
do.
i
mean,
if
it's
hard
to
do
it,
hard
to
allocate
it,
that's
an
effort,
that's
a
reasonable
effort,
so
they're
not
unreasonable
when
they
make
a
reasonable
effort,
even
if
it
doesn't
all
work
out
perfectly.
but
given
the
possibility
of
that
reasonable
effort,
what
justification
is
there
for
taking
the
money
that's
not
apportionable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i'm
right...
i
don't
know
if
this
is
the
only
place
that
does
that
in
the
code.
there's
a
rule
which
my
law
clerk
found
which
is
a
controlled
foreign
corporation
netting
rule,
and
that
has
to
do
with
a
circumstance
where
you
have
to
allocate
income
expense
to
certain
foreign
source
income
earned
when
you
lend
the
money
to
a
controlled
foreign
corporation
and
there's
both
been
an
increase
in
lending
and
an
increase
in
borrowing.
and
under
those
circumstances
there
is
some
rationality,
where
you've
loaned
more
money
to
your
off-shore
corporation,
and
at
the
same
time
you've
increased
the
borrowing,
so
i
could
at
least
see
a
rational
there
for
saying
we're
going
to
assume
this
extra
lending
is
allocated
to
the
extra
borrowing,
but
i
don't
think
you
even
have
anything
like
that
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
federal
constitution
permits
a
state
to
tax
a
propionate
share
of
the
income
of
an
out
of
state
company
that
does
a
particular
business
both
inside
and
outside
the
state,
but
the
state
cannot
tax
income
that
that
kind
of
company
receives
from
an
out-of-state
unrelated
business
activity
that
constitutes
a
discrete
business
entity.
so,
imagine
an
illinois
tin
can
maker
that
does
a
$10
million
tin
can
business
in
every
state
and
suppose
that
company
also
has
$200,000
dividend
income
from
a
completely
unrelated
new
zealand
sheep
farm;
that
means
california
could
tax
its
share
of
the
tin
can
income
but
it
could
not
touch
that
$200,000
dividend.
now
what
has
california
done?
well,
their
system
permits
the
manufacturer
to
deduct
certain
cost
from
income
including
interest
cost;
say
they
produce
those
tin
cans
with
borrowed
money
in
part.
well,
california
says
that
you
can
deduct
that
interest
only
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
the
dividend
from
the
sheep
farm,
so
if
the
company
let
us
say
has
$300,000
in
tin
can
interest
cost,
it
could
not
deduct
the
$300,000,
they
could
only
deduct
$100,000
because
it
exceeds
the
$200,000
dividend
by
$100,000.
now,
does
the
constitution
permit
the
type
of
deduction
system
that
i
just
illustrated
with
this
example
which
is
a
made
up
example?
we
decide
that
it
does
not,
we
think
that
california’s
deduction
rule
simply
taxes
in
out
of
state
companies
non-unitary
income,
the
vary
income
that
the
constitution
places
outside
the
state's
taxing
power.
some
years
ago
this
court
wrote
effectively
that
a
tax
on
sleeping
that
is
measured
by
the
number
of
shoes
in
your
closet
is
not
a
tax
on
sleeping,
it
is
a
tax
on
shoes
and
that
basically
underlies
our
reasoning
in
this
case.
now,
california
points
out
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
if
the
borrowed
money
is
really
for
the
sheep
business
or
for
the
tin
can
business
and
that
is
a
good
point,
but
it
does
not
justify
a
rule
that
assumes
that
all
borrowings
are
really
for
sheep.
neither
the
federal
government
nor
any
state
makes
any
assumption
that
is
that
reckoning,
rather
every
other
jurisdiction
uses
a
tracing
rule,
assumptions
or
allocates
borrowings
between
taxable
and
non-taxable
sources
in
some
proportionate
way.
california
has
not
explained
why
it
could
not
do
the
same.
for
that
reason
california’s
system
in
our
view
does
not
reflect
the
reasonable
sense
of
how
income
is
generated.
it
is
therefore
not
justified
and
because
it
taxes
untaxable
income
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution
forbid
it.
the
lower
court
decision
upholding
california’s
deduction
rule
is
reversed.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
