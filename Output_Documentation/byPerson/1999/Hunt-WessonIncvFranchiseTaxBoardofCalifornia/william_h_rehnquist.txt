chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-2043,
hunt-wesson
v.
franchise
tax
board.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
so
long
as
you're
in
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
hellerstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
beatrice
was
an
illinois
domiciliary
the
same
way
hunt-wesson
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
beatrice,
i
think.
it's
named
after
a
little
town
in
nebraska,
and
i
think
it's
pronounced
beatrice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
maybe
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
it
wouldn't
be
deductible
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
interest
has
to
be
business
interest
income,
does
it
not,
used
for
a
purpose...
the
money
has
to
be
used
for
a
purpose
in
connection
with
the
business,
or
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
california
could
deny
interest
deductions
in
toto...
your
claim
here
is
more
of
an
equal
protection
claim,
that
you've
been
treated
differently
than
other
california
corporations
similarly
situated,
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
made
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
contend,
do
you,
mr.
hellerstein,
that
california
has
to
have
the
same
method
of
taxing
that...
even
if
48
other
states
have
it,
the
constitution
doesn't
require
them
to
have--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
federal
principle
that
a
state
can't
tax
a
federal
entity
wouldn't
necessarily
carry
over
if
you
weren't
dealing
with
a
federal
entity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
income
from
a
federal
obligation
may
be
different
for
constitutional
purposes
than
income
from
some
other
kind
of
obligation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hellerstein.
mr.
lew,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
lew?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position,
mr.
lew,
that
california
in
the
long
run,
by
its
system,
doesn't...
is
not
able
to
tax
any
more
income
than
it
would
be
by
the
proportionality
just
because
some
people
get
a
break
and
others
don't
under
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
interest
deduction
be
based
on
loans
that
were
made
in
california,
or
can
they
be
made
anywhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lew.
mr.
hellerstein,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hellerstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-2043,
hunt-wesson,
inc.
versus
franchise
tax
board
of
california
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
