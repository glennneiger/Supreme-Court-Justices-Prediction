mr.
walter
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
constitutional
challenge
to
two
mechanisms
that
california
employs
to
deny
nondomiciliary
corporations,
like
petitioner
here,
an
otherwise
allowable
interest
expense
deduction.
each
of
these
mechanisms
provides
an
independent
basis
for
invalidating
the
application
of
california
statute
to
petitioner.
first,
as
respondent
has
stipulated,
california
denied
petitioner
an
interest
expense
deduction
entirely
because
it
received
nontaxable
dividends
from
nonunitary
subsidiaries.
second,
california
denied
petitioner
an
interest
deduction
because
those
dividends
were
paid
by
subsidiaries
that
did
no
business
in
california.
it
is
worth
stressing
at
the
outset,
your
honors,
that
the
second
mechanism
is
indistinguishable
from
the
taxing
scheme
that
this
court
struck
down
in
fulton
corporation
v.
faulkner.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
either
basis
would
be...
would
invalidate
the
statute.
during
the
tax
years
at
issue
here,
1980
to
'82,
petitioner
hunt-wesson,
which
is
the
successor
in
interest
to
the
original
taxpayer
in
this
case,
the
beatrice
foods
company,
earned
lawfully
&dollar
75
million
in
dividends
from
nonunitary
subsidiaries.
now,
it
is
undisputed
here
that
california
had
no
power
to
tax
those
dividends
under
this
court's
decisions
in
asarco,
and
woolworth--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
beatrice
was
an
illinois
domiciliary.
actually,
hunt-wesson
is
a
california
domiciliary,
but
they...
again,
they
were
the
successor
in
interest.
during
the
years
at
issue
we
are
dealing
with
an
illinois
domiciliary.
now,
during
those
same
years,
california
denied
beatrice
an
interest
deduction--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--beatrice.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
pronounce
it
beatrice.
[laughter]
mr.
walter
hellerstein
during
these
years,
beatrice
received
a...
its
interest
expense
deduction
was
denied
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
simply
because
it
received
these
nontaxable
dividends.
there
is
no
evidence,
no
evidence
at
all
in
this
case
that
the
interest
expense
bore
any
relationship
to
these
dividends.
indeed,
even
if
we
had
proven...
if
we
had
proven
that
every
penny
of
our
interest
expense
had
gone
to
generate
california
taxable
income,
we
would
have
been
denied
this
interest
expense
deduction
simply
because
we
had
these
nontaxable
dividends.
now,
this--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--i'm
not
sure.
i
mean,
the
way
that--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
stevens,
i
understand
your
question,
and
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
this
statute
works
regardless
of
any
proof
of
any
relationship.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
there
could
be
a
relationship,
there
couldn't
be
a
relationship.
it's
like
throwing
darts
at
a
dartboard.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
it
might
work,
might
not.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
if
we
have
interest
expense,
under
the
california
regime
we
get
the
deduction
first
against
any
interest,
business
interest
income
we
have,
and
then
we're
denied
the
deduction
if
we
have
the
nontaxable
dividends.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
the
interest
expense
that
we
have,
the
interest
expense
is
defined
at
the
federal
level.
we
use
a
federal
taxing
scheme,
so
the
federal
government
does
not
distinguish
between
whether
or
not
the
interest
expense
is
business
or
nonbusiness.
now,
under
the
california
statute
and
under
their
own...
or
their
own
schedule,
the
very
first
thing
we
do
is,
we
take
any
interest
expense
that
is,
in
fact,
attributable
to
the
nonbusiness
income,
and
we
take
that
out
of
the
mechanism.
then
the
only
thing
that
is
left
is
the
interest
expense
associated
with
the
business.
it
is
that
interest
expense
that
in
fact
is
put
into
this
little
mechanism
that
california
has
that
denies
us
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
the
deduction
against
the
nonunitary
dividends.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
let
me
explain
that,
because
there
has
been
a
dispute,
and
both
sides
say
the
dispute
doesn't
matter.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
okay.
let's
start
with
nonbusiness
income.
nonbusiness
income
is
income
that
under
this
uniform
statute
that
many
states
have
is
allocated,
that
is,
is
sent
to
one
jurisdiction
or
another,
rather
than
put
into
this
mix
that's
mixed
up
and
apportioned.
now--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--oh--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well,
let
me...
i
must
be
a
bit
more...
i've
got
to
polish
it
a
bit,
because
in
our
case
that's
correct.
in
our
case
the
particular
nonbusiness
income
we're
talking
about
are
nonunitary
dividends,
and
there's
no
dispute
that
california
can't
tax
that.
if,
for
example,
beatrice
had
an
unrelated
beauty
parlour
in
california,
california
could
have
taxed
that.
that
might
be
nonbusiness
income,
but
if
it
was
in
california
it
could
have
been
taxable.
but
in
this
case,
there's
no
distinction.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
nonbusiness
income
is
not
taxable.
now,
to
answer
your
question
about
what
is
nonbusiness
interest
expense,
i
think
we
use
that
term,
and
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
disagreement
here,
we
would
use
that
term
to
describe
any
interest
expense
that
could
be
directly
traced
to
the
nonbusiness
dividends.
if,
for
example...
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
anything
like
this
happened...
if,
for
example,
we
had
gone
out
and
borrowed
money
to
acquire
the
nonunitary
subsidiaries,
and
you
could
trace
that
borrowing
to
the
nonunitary
subsidiaries,
then
to
be
sure
you
would
have
nonbusiness
interest
expense,
and
we
would...
our
position
here
is
that
california
could
probably
deny
that.
they
could
probably
deny
it
if
they
had
a
tracing
mechanism,
which
they
don't,
if
they
said,
we've
seen
that
you've
gone
out
and
you
borrowed
money
to
buy
something
that's
going
to
generate
income
that
you
can't
tax,
we
accept
that.
indeed,
we
even
accept
their
notion,
which
is
that
it's
impossible
to
trace.
all
interest
is
fungible.
all
the
money
is
fungible.
who
knows
where
we
use
this.
again,
we
can...
we
accept
that
proposition.
the
problem
is
that
california
statute
doesn't
implement
that
proposition.
when,
in
fact,
you
don't
know
where
the
interest
expense
is
earned,
that
is,
you
can't
do
the
tracing
that
we're
talking
about,
what
do
jurisdictions
do?
mr.
walter
hellerstein
no,
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
you're
right
that
we'd
lose
our
case,
because
we're
willing
to...
we
accept
the
proposition
that
a
state
can
reasonably
take
the
position,
and
california
in
this
case
could
reasonably
have
taken
the
position
that
all
money
is
fungible,
and
therefore
it
is
impossible
ever
to
trace
on
a
direct
basis
a
dollar
of
interest
income
to
a
dollar
of
interest
expense.
but
even
accepting
that
proposition,
one
thing
is
clear
from...
when
you
accept
that
proposition
that
you
are
then
saying,
you
don't
know
where
money
is
coming
from
or
going,
but
then
it
cannot
be...
it
cannot
be
assigned
disproportionately
to
nontaxable
income
rather
than
to
taxable
income,
so
even
accepting
the
notion
that
money
is
fungible,
all
we're
saying...
and
we're
not
saying...
we're
not
trying
to
constitutionalize
any
particular
methodology.
all
we're
saying
is,
do
what
48
other
state,
or
45
other
states
do,
do
what
the
federal
government
does.
spread
it
around
on
any
of
a
variety
of
reasonable
bases,
including,
if
you'll
read
the
letter
that
california's
already
written
to
general
electric
if
they
lose
this
case,
spread
it
around
based
on
where
your
assets
are.
that
is,
if
you
don't
know
where
your
money's
coming
from--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--justice
kennedy,
if
california
wanted
to
deny
all
interest
deduction
to
all
taxpayers,
whether
they
had
taxable
or
nontaxable
income,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
think
that's
quite
arbitrary.
it
might
no
longer
be
a
net
income
tax,
but
that's
not
the
constitutional
issue
raised
by
this
case.
the
problem
here
is
that
what
california
has
done
is,
under
the
guise
of
saying
money
is
fungible,
come
up
with
a
mechanism
that
disproportionately
assigns
income,
at
least
in
our
case,
to
the
nontaxable
income,
so
based
on
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case,
california's
taken
the
position
that
somehow
we
never
make
a
dollar,
a
penny...
we
never
make
a
penny
from
interest
expense
invested
in
nonbusiness
income.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
no,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
our
claim
is
that
while
we
agree
that
california
could
have
an
across-the-board
nondiscriminatory
treatment
of
interest
expense,
what
california
is
doing,
and
the
court
below
held...
the
trial
court
held
they
were
violating
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
we've
not
raised
that
here.
we're
saying
that
what
this
does,
what
this
statute
does
is
two
things.
first,
it
sweeps
nontaxable
income
into
the
tax
base.
that's
a
due
process
violation.
that's
an
extraterritorial
component.
california
in
fact
says
that
we're
going
to
measure
your
tax
by
these
dividends
out
there
that
we
can't
get
our
hands
on
under
asarco,
under
woolworth,
number
1.
number
2,
we're
also...
in
our
view
this
also
has
a
discriminatory
component,
because
when
you
look
at
who
gets
this
interest
deduction
it's
only
the
domiciliary
rather
than
the
nondomiciliary.
as
arbitrary
as
the
statute
is,
it
helps
the
domiciliary
because
these...
this
interest
expense
is
always
attributed
to
the
nonbusiness
income,
which
in
this
case
would
be
taxable
by
california,
so
the
nondom...
so
the
domiciliary
gets
the
full
tax
deduction,
whereas
the
nondomiciliary--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
justice
breyer,
because
illinois
does
not
have
this
arbitrary
system
like
california
does.
illinois
would
take
the
position
that
this...
one
of
two
positions.
i'm
assuming
it
could
either
trace...
it
could
say,
we're
going
to
directly
trace--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--that
is
correct.
in
other
words...
let
me
just
make
sure
that
i...
i
mean--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes.
no,
but...
no--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--exactly,
and--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--and
therefore
the...
this
would...
it
would
generate
nonbusiness
dividends.
california
would
say,
gee,
you
have
interest
equal
to
those
nonbusiness
dividends,
no
deduction,
and
then
in
illinois...
then
the
question
would
be
whether
illinois
would
take
the
same
position,
and
the
answer
is
no,
because
illinois,
being
a
state
that
is
not
off
the
radar
screen
like
california,
but
does
what
other
states
do,
they'd
look
at
their
interest
expense,
see
whether
or
not
this
interest
was
associated
first
with
the
outer
mongolian
sheep
farm.
if
it
wasn't...
if
it
was,
they
get
the
deduction,
because
this
is
a
domiciliary
state.
if
it
wasn't,
it
would
go
into
the
pool
and
they
might
spread
it
around,
so
that's
how
it
would
work.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that
is
precisely
right,
justice
ginsburg.
our
position
is
that
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
acceptable
methodologies
for
assigning
or
allocating
income
to
various
jurisdictions.
they're
in
place
in
all
of
the
states,
they're
in
place
at
the
federal
level,
and
what
we're
simply
saying
is
that
you
cannot
have
allocation
by
wishful
thinking,
which
is
essentially
what
california
has
here.
it's
a
simply--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well,
i
can
tell
you
that
our--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--justice
scalia,
i
can
only
speak
to
two
specific
situations
that...
one
that
i'm
aware
of
because
it's
our
case,
another
because
it's
in
the
amicus
brief.
certainly
with
regard
to
our
case
there
has
been...
we
have
stipulated
to
the
refund
to
which
we're
entitled
should
we
prevail
in
this
case.
it
was
my
understanding
from...
certainly
from
the
letter
that
california
has
written
to
general--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no.
the
stipulation...
the
stipulation
was
based
on
a...
it
was
an
all-or-nothing
proposition.
we
were
going...
there
might
have
been
settlement
negotiations
earlier,
but
at
this
point
we
agreed
here--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--if
we
win.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
for
these
particular
years,
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
however,
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
from
the
letter
appended
to
the
general
electric's
brief,
that
california
is
aware
of
this
litigation,
they
have
written
letters
to
general
electric
and
presumably
to
other
taxpayers
saying,
and
by
the
way,
if
we
lose
this
case,
you'd
better
apportion
your
interest
expense
by
a
reasonable
amount,
namely
an
asset
allocation
method,
so
i--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--i
think
frankly--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--actually,
justice
kennedy,
the
way
i
would
answer
that,
i
think
that's
because
of
california's
californiacentric
view
of
the
universe.
in
fact,
there
is
no
windfall,
because
beatrice
pays
taxes
in
45
other
states,
so
that
the...
any
income...
we're
not
talking
about
tax
exempt
municipal
bonds
here.
i
mean,
income
that
california
says
is
not
taxable
in
california
because
it's
not
a
unitary...
part
of
the
unitary
business
is
presumably
taxable
somewhere
else.
the
only
time
there
would
be
a
windfall
would
be
if
the
income
that
california
is
not
taxing
under
a
proper
scheme
is
somehow
not
taxed
by
the
other
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
i
would
certainly
accept
that
if
california
apportioned
in
the
way
that
other
states
apportioned,
there
would
be
no
windfall,
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
absolutely
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
absolutely
not.
we
are
saying
that
there
are...
we
are
saying
that
their
method
is
so
far
off
the
radar
screen,
is
so
different
from
any
method
that
even
approximates
a
reasonable
method,
and
there
are
a
large
variety
of
them,
whether
it's
assets
or
gross
receipts
or
net
income,
any
of
those
would
be
appropriate.
indeed,
to
look
at
this
court's
own
opinions,
this
court
has
looked
at
this
problem
in
a
number
of
instances,
generally
when
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
taxpayer,
or
how
a
taxpayer
should
attribute
expense
between
taxable
income
and
tax
exempt
income,
generally
either
municipal
bond
income
that
wasn't
taxable
at
the
federal
level,
or
alternatively,
federal
taxable
income
that
wasn't
taxable
by
the
states,
and
what
the
court
has
said...
when
the
court
has
looked
at
this,
the
court
has
really
rejected
both
extremes.
the
court
has
rejected
the
extreme
view
of
the
states,
which
has
been
to
say...
or
the
taxing
authority,
when
the
taxing
authority
has
said,
you
may
not
deduct
1
penny
of
this
expense...
that
is,
the
expense
must
be
matched
dollar-for-dollar
against
the
tax-exempt
income,
which
is
what
the...
the
kind
of
situation
that
arises
in
national
life,
the
court
said,
you
can't
do
that,
because
that
really
undermines
the
exemption.
on
the
other
hand,
when
taxpayers
have
been
greedy,
when
taxpayers
have
said,
we
don't
want
&dollar
1
of
our
expense
assigned
to
our
nontaxable
income,
because
that
undermines
the
exemption,
the
court
has
said
no,
that's
not
right,
either.
what
the
court
has
said
is
really
precisely
what
most
states
and
thel
federal
government
have
said
in
this
kind
of
situation,
is
when
you
don't
know,
when
you
can't
trace
the
amounts,
what
you
do
is,
you
spread
it
evenly.
this
court
has
said,
there's
no
reason
in
law,
or
no
sound
legal
or
economic
reason
for
distinguishing
between
the
taxable
and
the
nontaxable
dollar.
that's
the
theme.
so
long
as
there
is
some
reasonable
apportionment
between
taxable
and
nontaxable,
that,
i
think,
is
all
the
constitution
requires.
what
the
constitution
forbids
is
a
disproportionate
assignment
of
income
to
values
that
cannot
be
taxed.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
forbids--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--right.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
yes,
justice
breyer.
it
will
depend
on--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well,
i
guess,
you
know,
it
would
depend
on
the
provision.
well,
the
basic
thought
is
that
by
arbitrarily
denying
the
deduction
you
are
taxing
the
income,
so--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--the
due
process
and
the
commerce
clause,
as
this
court
has
held
in
allied-signal
and
asarco
and
woolworth.
in
the
intergovernmental
immunities
cases,
that
is,
when
we're
dealing
with...
let's
deal
with
the
modern
cases.
we're
dealing
with
state
taxation
of
federal
obligations
such
as
in
the
barker
bank
case.
there,
georgia
would
have
been
forbidden
under
the...
under
mccullough
v.
maryland,
but
as
embodied
in,
know
in
federal
statutes
from
taxing
the
federal
income.
some
of
the
earlier
cases
are
based
on
the--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
way
the
cases
have
arisen
with
regard
to
that
issue,
that
is,
it
is
a
given
proposition
of...
i
think
of
federal
constitutional
law
and
also
valid
federal
statutory
law
that
states
may
not
tax
income
from
federal
obligations,
so
a
state,
for
example,
could
not
come
along
and
deny,
as
california
has
denied,
an
interest
expense
deduction
arbitrarily
assigned
to
every
dollar
of
federal
income
that
it
can't
tax.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
it
is
both,
indeed,
as
justice
o'connor
was
pointing
out,
and
in
allied-signal
the
court
said
that
the
extraterritorial
analysis,
or
the
bar
on
state
taxation
of
extraterritorial
values
is
rooted
both
in
the
due
process
and
the
commerce
clauses,
so
you'd
have
two
constitutional
bases
for
that.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
in
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
illinois
is
not
a
tax
haven,
and
during
the
years
at
issue
here,
the...
and
this...
by
the
way,
these
were
years
during
which
there
was
considerable
uncertainty
as
to
whether
or
not
income
was
apportionable.
there
were
the...
this
court...
some
members
of
this
court
will
recall
the
asarco
and
woolworth
and
container
cases
in
the
eighties,
where
there
was
uncertainty.
illinois
had
a
regulation
at
that...
during
those
years
that
actually
allowed
a
domiciliary
corporation
like
beatrice,
and
the
regulation
is
300-2(c)(2)(a),
that
during
those
years
allowed
a
domiciliary
corporation
to
apportion
its
income.
now,
that
was
a
decision
made
by
illinois.
illinois
had
the
constitutional
power,
and
indeed
our...
it
is
stipulated
in
the...
it's...
i
believe
it's
stipulation,
paragraph
8.
it's
stipulated
that
nonunitary
dividends
were
taxable
by
the
state
of
illinois,
so
there's
no
windfall
tax
haven
issue
here.
in
fact--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--that
is
precisely
right,
justice
scalia.
california's
power
to
tax
does
not
expand
based
on
illinois'
decision
whether
or
not
to
tax.
we'd
have...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
next
5
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
i
have
three
very
brief
points.
first,
with
regard
to
the
cfc
netting
rule
that
both
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg
referred
to,
you're
quite
right,
justice
breyer,
the
cfc
netting
rule
is,
in
fact,
a
very
finely
tuned
tracing
rule,
as
justice
scalia
said.
it
only
arises
in
a
situation
when
there's...
you
go
to
some
unrelated
lender,
you
borrow
money,
you
then
relend
that
money
to
your
controlled
foreign
corporation,
the
controlled
foreign
corporation
then
pays
you
interest.
that's
the
situation
we're
talking
about.
if
california
had
anything
like
that,
we
certainly
wouldn't
be
here.
again,
a
finely
tuned
mechanism
addressed
to
a
specific
tax
evasion
problem
which
actually
doesn't
even...
it
just
reduces
the
foreign
tax
credit,
is
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
not
even
a...
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
problem.
point
two,
mr.
lew
suggested,
gee,
these...
all
these
other
formulas
that
we're
suggesting
are
reasonable
are
vulnerable
to
the
same
sort
of
criticism
that
we're
making,
and
that's
not
true.
the
criticism
that
we're
making
is
that
the
california
formula
disproportionately
assigns
interest
expense
to
nontaxable
income.
all
of
those
other
formulas
do
it
on
an
even-handed,
nondiscriminatory
basis.
and
finally,
his
suggestion
that,
because
the
statute
is
internally
consistent
it
is
therefore
constitutional,
is
a
non
sequitur.
it
would
be...
if
california
had
a
statute
that
assigned
income
based
on
the
number
of
square
miles
in
a
state,
that
would
be
internally
consistent,
but
i
think
would
plainly
be
unconstitutional
and,
indeed,
in
cases
involving
retaliatory
taxes,
which
are
entirely
consistent,
this
court
has
also
held
they
are
unconstitutional.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
