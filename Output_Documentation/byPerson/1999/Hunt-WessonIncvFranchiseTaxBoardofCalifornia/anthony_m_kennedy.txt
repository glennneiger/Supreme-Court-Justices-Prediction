i'm
not
sure
what
you
accept
insofar
as
the
fact
that
all
money's
fungible
and
can't
be
traced.
you
say
you
accept
that
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
accept
that
proposition
in
some
instances,
but
not
in
every
instance,
or
then
you'd
lose
your
case.
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
deny
the
deduction
altogether.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
on
that
basis
maybe
you
could
help
me
understand
what
the
state
says
in
its
red
brief
at
page
21.
it
says,
if
a
deduction
of
the
entire
amount
of
interest
expense
is
allowed,
the
corporation
stands
to
gain
a
tax
windfall,
and
then
it
goes
on.
i
take
it
that's
only
because
california
does
not
have
an
apportionment
system
in
place,
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
you
would
answer
that?
you'll
say,
well,
sure,
but
if
you
have
an
apportionment
scheme
in
place
like
other
states
do,
there
won't
be
a
windfall.
is
that
how
you
answer
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
answer
there
wouldn't
be
a
windfall
if
there
were
an
apportionment
scheme?
would
you
accept
that
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
solved
that
problem
by
denying
it
against
all
nonunitary
income
whether
or
not
the
interest
expense
was
related
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
it's
always
effective
if
you
deny
apportionment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
the
business
interest
is
big
enough,
then
there's
going
to
be
no
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it's
not
allocable
against
all
its
nonbusiness
income.
