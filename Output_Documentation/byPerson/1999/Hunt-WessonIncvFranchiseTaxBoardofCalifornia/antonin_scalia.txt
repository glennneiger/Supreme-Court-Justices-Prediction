--could
you
tell
me,
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
was
about
to
ask
what
you
mean
by
nonbusiness
interest
expense.
is
it
just
interest
expense,
or
nonbusiness
income,
for
that
matter?
does
that
mean
just
income
that
california
can't
tax,
or
does
it
have
some
other
meaning?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
get
a
definition.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
really
business
income
that
just
can't
be
taxed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
this
case
by
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
assuming
we
agree,
but
what
does
california
do
with
respect
to
these
back
years
that
have
already
been
treated
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
it
adopt
a,
what
you
would
consider
a
constitutional
rule,
and
apply
them
to
those
past
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
what,
some
kind
of
apportionment
scheme
that
you're
willing
to
accept?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'll
get
it
all
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
too
late
for
them
to
say,
okay,
we'll
apportion
some
of
it.
they...
none
of
it
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
matters,
though,
do
you,
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
illinois
decides
to
be
generous
and
not
tax
something,
california,
if
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
tax,
can
say,
hey,
you
know,
somebody's
getting
a
break.
we
ought
to
be
able
to
reap
that
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
still
not
be...
not
be
justified.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
achieve
that
objective.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
to
say
that
it
does.
you
don't
have
a
right
to
send
a
tax
bill
to
every
nondomiciliary
of
california
for
all
of
their
income,
and
you
say,
well,
you
know,
we
can't
be
sure
that
we
can't
tax
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
irrational.
you
either
demonstrate
that
it
comes
from
this
other
nontaxable
income,
or...
or,
if
you
can't
demonstrate
it,
then,
you
know,
do
a
reasonable
apportioning,
but
you
do
neither
one.
you're
just
saying,
here,
here's
a
tax
bill,
pay
it,
or
we're
not
sure
where
this
income
comes
from,
but
we
don't
want
you
to
get
away
with
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
wasn't
spent
there,
it
could
have
been
spent
elsewhere,
so
it's
hard
to
say
that
it
necessarily
went
to
this.
it's
saving
you
spending
other
money
elsewhere.
of
course,
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
adopt
that
fungibility
principle,
which
your
opponent
is
quite
willing
to
accept,
what
it
leads
to
is
not
the
conclusion
that
you
can
tax
all
of
it,
but
the
conclusion
that
you
should
apportion
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
only
if
illinois
or,
you
know,
some
other
state
decides
to
give
it
the
tax
benefit,
and
that's
none
of
your
business.
if
some
other
state
wants
to
give
them
a
tax
double
benefit,
that's
none
of
california's
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
but
that's
the
tax
benefits
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
our
decisions
in
allied-signal
and
asarco.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
it's
sort
of
hard
for
you
to
give
up
that
old
1972
california
supreme
court
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
it's
a
tracing
rule,
rather
than
an
allocation
rule.
all
that
your
opponent
is
asking
is
that
you
either
allocate
or
trace,
but
you've
done
neither.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
provision
seems
to
try
to
trace.
