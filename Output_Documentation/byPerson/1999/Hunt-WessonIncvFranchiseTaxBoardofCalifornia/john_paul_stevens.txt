smart
move.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question.
what
if
the
interest
expense
had
been
incurred
to
generate
different
nonunitary
income.
say
you
borrowed
money
to
buy
a
lot
of
securities
in
japan,
whereas
the
income
here
is
from
income
from
securities
in
germany,
would
it
then
be
permissible?
do
you
understand
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
give
you
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
interest
expense
is
incurred
to
generate
nonunitary
income
but
not
the
nonunitary...
not
the
same
nonunitary
income
that
might
be
earned
elsewhere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
treat
the
interest
as
paid...
say
you
have
a
mortgage
on
a
new
plant
that
you're
using
in
california.
you
treat
it
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
interest
to
buy
securities
in
mongolia
that
are
going
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
unitary
business.
you
just
merge
all
of
your
interest
income
and
treat
it
as
fungible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
interest
expense,
i
mean,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it's
very
easy
to
identify
that
in
fact
some
of
the
income
produced
by
those
borrowings
is
not
part
of
the
unitary
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
you
just
ask
the
taxpayer
to
assume
the
burden
of
persuading
you
that
any
interest...
any
income,
or
interest
deduction
that
it
seeks
to
obtain
is
attributable
to
the
unitary
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
is
true
of
payroll
and
other
expenses
in
this
gigantic
balance
sheet
and
income
statement
they
have
to
prepare
in
these
things.
there's
always
room
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
does
seem
to
me
it's
not
entirely
unlike
taking
the
president
of
the
corporation's
salary.
you
do
some
allocating
there.
you've
got
to...
you
know,
there's
room
for...
i
don't
know
why
interest
is
any
harder
to
allocate
than
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
dollars
paid
to
the
president
of
the
corporation
are
pretty
fungible,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
salary,
i
mean.
