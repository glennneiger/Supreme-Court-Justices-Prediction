justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
answer
all
the
questions
here
if
we
were
to
find
that
the
interest
offset
is
unconstitutional
because
it
taxes
income
over
which
california
lacks
jurisdiction
to
tax.
that's
the
end
of
it,
presumably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
we'd
held
in
allied-signal
that
it
violates
the
due
process
clause--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
a
state
to
tax--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
problem
here
is,
california
has
chosen
to
allocate
100
percent
of
the
taxpayer's
interest
expense
in
excess
of
its
business
interest
income
to
its
generation
of
nonbusiness
income
that's
not
taxable
by
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it's
california's
choice
to
have
this
scheme,
and
it's
enacted
one
that
does
raise
concerns
of
trying
to
tax
extraterritorial
income,
in
effect.
i
mean,
california
wouldn't
have
to
do
it
this
way.
california
could
have
a
reasonable
allocation
method.
but
what's
the
rationale
for
this
scheme
it
does
have,
which
just
seems
to
go
beyond
what
california
is
authorized
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
california
asserts
here
the
right
to
treat
it
as
though
it
was
all
used,
the
money,
to
generate
nonbusiness
income.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
we
know
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
don't
we,
that
that
isn't
true,
and
there's
no
move
made
by
california
to
do
any
allocation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
doesn't
cover
that
point,
but...
and
i
can
find
it
elsewhere,
i
assume,
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
what
i
said
is
true.
the
effect
of
the
california
provision
would
be
to
not
allocate
it
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
treat
it
as
though
all
of
the
expense
incurred
in
borrowing
money
went
to
the
outside
nonunitary
business.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
sure
all
right.
it's
100
percent
dollar-for-dollar.
i
mean,
it
makes
no
effort
to
apportion,
and
you're
going
to
have
to
persuade
me
that
that's
reasonable,
because
i
don't
find
anything
in
what
you've
said
that
makes
me
think
that's
reasonable.
no
other
state
does
that.
there's
no
effort
made
to
allocate
it.
i
just...
i
have
yet
to
hear
a
reason.
i
guess--
--except
i
want
to
be
sure,
100
percent
sure.
i
guess
the
california
supreme
court
case
on
which
the
california
court
of
appeal
decision
here
was
based
was
decided
a
long
time
ago.
