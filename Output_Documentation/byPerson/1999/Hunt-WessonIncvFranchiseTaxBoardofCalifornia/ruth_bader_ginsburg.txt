mr.
hellerstein,
your
position
is
not
that
california
couldn't
reject
any
part
of
this.
it
could
have
an
offset,
but
it
as
to
be
according
to
some
apportionment,
some
reasonable
apportionment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
the
argument
that,
indeed,
your
client
is
getting
a
windfall
because
home
states
like
illinois
give
a
tax
break
for
this
category
of
investment
income?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
argument
has
been
made
that
if
you
look
at
how
the
federal
taxation
works,
income
taxation,
in
the
main
there
is
an
allocation,
but
there's
also
an
argument
that
at
least
in
one
respect
the
federal
income
tax...
i
forgot
whether
it's...
it
has
something
to
do
with
foreign
investment,
or
foreign
corporations,
that
the
internal
revenue
code
does
what
california
does
in
that
one
discrete
area.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
could
make
the
argument
that
if
it's
rational
for
the
internal
revenue
code
to
do
that,
so
it's
rational
for
california
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
that
california,
if
we
were
not
to
accept
your
position,
and
were
to
say
that
you
have
to
make
some
effort
to
allocate,
california
could
do
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--without
having
a
new
statute
that
does
it?
that
is,
the
example...
which
company
was
it
that
we
have
in
these
cases?
is
it
general
motors,
or
general
electric?
i
don't
remember.
could
the
tax
commissioner
say,
well,
what
we
did
is
no
good,
here's
something
else
that
is
good,
so
we're
going
to
do
that
even
though
we
don't
have
a
statute
that
so
provides?
