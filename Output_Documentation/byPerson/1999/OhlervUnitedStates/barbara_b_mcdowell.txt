ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
to
reveal
his
prior
conviction
on
direct
examination
waives
any
claim
of
error
with
respect
to
its
admission.
that's
the
undisputed
rule
where
the
district
court
has
not
ruled
in
limine
on
the
admissibility
of
the
conviction,
for
it's
well
settled
that
a
party
cannot
introduce
adverse
evidence
as
its
own
for
its
own
tactical
purposes
and
then
challenge
the
admission
of
the
evidence
on
appeal.
there's
no
reason
to
depart
from
that
sensible
rule
where,
as
here,
the
district
court
did
issue
an
in
limine
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
a
conviction.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
take
the
position
that
that's
a
waiver.
i
don't
recall
any
cases
specifically
presenting--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--only
under
the
rulings
of
those
circuits
who
have
allowed
the
contrary
of
the
rule
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
there
are
other
instances
in
which
there's
evidence
that
a
district
court
has
allowed
in
only
as
rebuttal
evidence
other
sorts
of
impeachment
evidence
in
addition
to
rule
609--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--typically
not,
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
doesn't
depend
on
that,
justice
o'connor,
although
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
rule
is
particularly
justified
in
those
609(a)(1)
cases.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
we
would
take
the
position
that
even
with
respect
to
those
evidentiary
issues
that
the
authors
of
the
rule
and
those
courts
that
have
adopted
the
definitive
nondefinitive
distinction
would
classify
as
definitive,
for
example,
rulings
under
609(a)(2)
with
respect
to
whether
a
conviction
involves
dishonesty
or
false
statement.
those
can
be
resolved
definitively
before
trial
for
purposes
of
not
having
to
make
a
contemporaneous
objection--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
it
can't.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
it
cannot.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
in
order
to
be
definitive,
a
ruling
has
to
possess
two
characteristics.
one,
it
has
to
be
the
kind
of
issue
that
can
be
resolved
definitively
before
trial,
and
the
courts
have
said
that
if
it
requires
a
balancing
of--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--prejudicial
and
probative--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
definitive
in
some
sense,
but
it's
the
sort
of
ruling
that
requires
the
court
to
keep
an
open
mind
in
the
course
of
trial
as
to
whether
it's
actually
going
to
come
in,
because--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
that's
what
this
court
appeared
to
recognize
in
luce.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
but
it's
not
offensive
to
a
judge
to
simply
renew
an
objection
and
to
point
out--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
but--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
but
those
courts
that
have
adopted
that
distinction
have
said
that
rule
609(a)(1)
rulings
are
not
definitive
because
they
require
a
balancing
of
probative
value
of
prejudicial
effects.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
the
advisory
committee
cited
two
cases
holding
that,
or
stating
that
in
its
notes,
so
what
we
suggest
is--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
text
raises
the
question
of
what
is
definitive.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
meaning
of
the
word
definitive
is
something
that
is
not
clear
on
its
face.
the
courts
that,
as
i
said,
have
adopted
that
distinction,
require
both
a
ruling
of
the
sort
that
can
be
made
before
trial
without
a
balancing
of--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--generally
under
the
rule
applied
in
most
circuits
today,
you
would
have
to
make
a
contemporaneous
objection
at
trial
to
evidence
that
you
wanted
to
exclude
and
that
you
wanted
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--if
it's
evidence
that
you
want
to
introduce,
there's
no
reason,
presumably,
why
you
would
want
to
preserve
an
objection
to
its
admission.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
as
we
indicated,
i
believe
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief,
that
approach
would
be
much
less
problematic.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
say
that
it's
still
a
waiver
because
the
defendant
is
still
trying
to
introduce
adverse
evidence
as
his
own,
for
his
own
practical
purposes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
there's
a
second
reason
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
it's
still
a
waiver.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
in
the
first
place
because
it's
contrary
to
generally
accepted
evidentiary
law
that
if
you
introduce
evidence
yourself
you
can't
complain
about
it
later.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
client's
decision
to
testify.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
it's
not--
[laughter]
there
are
many
ways
in
which
a
criminal
defendant
can
seek
to
draw
the
sting,
so
to
speak,
of
a
prior
conviction.
defendant
doesn't
have
to
do
it
by
introducing
the
conviction
first.
for
example,
the
defendant
can
explain
the
conviction
on
redirect
examination.
the
defendant
can
bring
out,
as,
in
fact,
petitioner's
counsel
did
here
on
closing
argument,
that
maria
really
wanted
to
tell
you
her
story
of
the
case,
and
she
knew
that
the
conviction
was
going
to
be
brought
in
by
the
government,
but
she
wanted
to
tell
you
the
story
anyway.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
but
she
can
diffuse
it
in
other
ways
as
well,
as
i
was
saying,
by
her
explanation
of
the
conviction
on
redirect,
by
the
way
she
answers
the
question
put
to
her
by
the
prosecutor
on
cross
examination,
by
seeking
instructions
saying
that
the
jury
is
not
to
draw
any
inference
from
who
introduces
the
conviction.
there
are
many
other
ways
in
which
to
take
the
sting--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
might
be
well...
might
well
be
viewed
as
opening
the
door
to
the
subject
matter.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
might
well,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
there's
another
principle
to
remember
here,
and
that's
when
we're
dealing
with
these
threshold
evidentiary
procedural
questions,
it's
often
beneficial
to
have
a
bright
line
rule,
even
if
there
are
some
cases
where
the
rationale
for
the
rule
is
not
as--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
the
question
would--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--not
if
the
defendant
has
introduced
the
issue
sufficiently
herself.
if
she
has
been
the
one
who
has
presented
it
to
the
jury,
who
has
precluded
the
district
court
and
the
government
from
a
last
clear
chance
to
decide
not
to
introduce
the
conviction,
no,
it's
a
waiver.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
because
in
many
circumstances,
or
at
least
some
circumstances,
the
prosecutor
may
want
to
know
how
the
rest
of
the
cross
examination
goes.
it
may
turn
out
that
the
prior
conviction
is
not
necessary
if
the
impeachment
goes
well
on
other
matters,
or
if
for
some
other
reason
during
cross
examination
the
introduction
of
the
prior
conviction
seems
particularly
problematic,
and
a
prosecutor
should
be
able
to
preserve
the
option
to
decide
later
in
cross
examination
whether--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
if
that's
his
true
intent,
but
it
would
still
be
a
waiver,
we
would
submit,
even
in
that
circumstance.
however,
as
we
point
out,
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
no
opportunity
given
whatsoever
to
the
government
or
to
the
district
court
to
reconsider
the
in
limine
ruling
right
before
petitioner
introduced
it
at
trial.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
of
course,
all
of
those
statements
were
made
before
trial,
and
an
in
limine
motion
of
this
kind
is
made
with
the
implicit
assumption
that
a
district
court
can
reconsider
it.
the
district
court
in
this
case
also
specifically
said--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
they
may
not
explicitly
say
that,
your
honor,
but
certainly
if
they
see
an
error
arising--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
court
held
that
a
defendant
could
be
required
to
choose
whether
to
take
the
stand,
be
impeached
with
a
prior
conviction,
and
preserve
the
objection
for
appeal,
or
alternatively
choose
not
to
testify
and
abandon
the
issue,
and
the
court
said
that
was
permissible.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
may
be,
but
there's
still
the
question
of
not
knowing
whether
the
district
court
actually
would
have
admitted
the
conviction
or
whether
the
government
would
have
tried
to
introduce
it.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
until
she
takes
the
stand,
no.
she's
not
obligated
to
make
a
commitment
to
do
that.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
it
is.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
issue
has
generally
arisen
after
motions
in
limine
have
been
decided
on
the
matter,
specifically
with
respect
to
prior
convictions.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
lot
of
case
law
that
deals
with
matters
other
than
that.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
typically
the
issue
arises
only
with
respect
to
impeachment
evidence.
in
the
other
circumstance
it
would--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
it
may
have.
the
general
principle
has,
of
course,
arisen
that
has
been
articulated
quite
frequently
and
in
cases
dating
back
before
the
rules
of
evidence
that
if
a
party
introduces
adverse
evidence
for
his
own
tactical
purposes,
he
is
bound
by
that
decision
and
cannot
challenge
it
on
appeal.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
believe
it
is.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
it's
the
same.
[laughter]
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
