isn't
that
what
the
government
will
do
all
the
time,
if
you
win
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
that
they
have
to
be
dishonest
about
it.
they
simply
can
take
the
position
that,
given
the
nonwaiver
rule,
it's
simply
in
their
interest
to
have
the
decision
made,
in
effect,
at
the
last
possible
moment
when,
in
fact,
the
judge
knows
as
much
as
the
judge
can
possibly
know
in
weighing
the
relative
probity
versus
prejudice,
and
it's
in
the
government's
interest
in
effect
to
avoid
appeal
risks.
so
i
don't
think
the
government
necessarily
would
have
to
act
in
bad
faith
simply
to
say,
we're
not
going
to
make
the
final
decision
and
we're
not
going
to
make
a
representation.
i
can
see
that
as
being
something
the
government
might
choose
to
do
in
good
faith.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's...
is
that
a
realworld
scenario?
i
mean,
that's
conceivable,
but
that's
really
not
going
to
happen
very
often,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--when
you
assume
that
the
defendant
is
put
to,
into
the
position
of
bringing
it
out
herself,
you're
assuming
something
which
i
guess
most
of
us
assume,
and
that
is
that
she's
really
going
to
reap
a
significant
advantage
by
doing
so.
there
was
at
least
one
study
cited,
i
guess,
in
the
government's
brief
that
calls
that
into
question.
i
didn't
read
the
study.
i
take
it
you
probably
have.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
my
thought
was
maybe
we
shouldn't
have.
but
you
think
we
got
it
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
