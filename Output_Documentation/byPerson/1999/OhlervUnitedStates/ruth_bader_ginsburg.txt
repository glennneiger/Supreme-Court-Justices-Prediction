mr.
coleman,
could
not
the
defense
have,
to
be
sure
about
this,
said
to
the
judge,
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
just
before
the
defendant
testified,
judge,
i
don't
want
to
bring
out
this
conviction
if
i
can
avoid
it,
but
if
your
ruling
is
going
to
stick,
let
me
know
now?
couldn't
he
have
confirmed
the
in
limine
ruling
by
asking
just
before
the
testimony,
government,
are
you
going
to
bring
this
up,
and
then
there
would
have
been
no
doubt
about
the
definitiveness
of
the
ruling,
or
the
government's
expectation
of
bringing
it
out
on
cross?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
defense
attorneys
respond
that
way.
defense
attorneys,
if
they
know
that
a
prior
conviction
is
in
the
wind,
will
try
to
diffuse
it.
i
think
that's
standard
operating
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
agree,
seem
to
agree
with
the
government
that
waiver
is
the
right
concept,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
the
government
is
urging
is
really
forfeiture.
you're
not
saying,
here
it
is
and
i
voluntarily
give
it
up.
you
don't
want
to
give
it
up,
but
the
government
is
contending
that
the
consequences
of
your
bringing
it
up
on
direct
is
that
you
forfeit
the
right
to
appeal.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coleman,
in
this
particular
case,
if
i
remember
right,
the
judge
was
genuinely
in
doubt
at
the
outset.
he
asked
for
briefing,
he
had
an
oral
argument
on
the
issue,
and
then
he
made
a
ruling
that
he
considered
definitive,
but
he
said
it's
a
close
call.
is
there...
relevant
in
this
picture
at
all
that
maybe
district
judges
would
like
to
know
what
the
law
is,
so
that's
a
reason
for
saying,
if
the
judge
has
made
a
definitive
ruling
that
he
called
a
close
call,
there
should
be
appellate
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ms.
mcdowell,
if...
isn't
it
a
factor
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
look
like
she
had
something
to
hide
if
she
keeps
her
mouth
shut
on
direct,
then
the
prosecutor
brings
it
out?
think
of
what
happened
in
this
case.
she
diffused
it
to
the
extent
that
the
prosecutor
just
had
one
simple
little
question.
he
couldn't
make
a
big
deal
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
the
judge,
the
judge
said
before
the
examination
of
the
defendant,
obviously
the
prior
conviction
can
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
he
made
his
ruling.
he
spent
an
extra
day.
he
had
briefs.
he
had
argument.
he
decided
it.
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
as
definitive
as
a
ruling
could
be,
and
then
he
backed
it
up
later
on
by...
said,
obviously
it
can
be
admitted.
