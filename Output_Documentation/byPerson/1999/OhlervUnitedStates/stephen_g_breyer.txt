justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
relevant
here
or
not...
i've
been
thinking,
not
about
rule
609
but
103.
my
thought
was
simply
that
there's
a
definitive
ruling
by
the
judge.
the
judge
says,
i
rule,
government,
you
can
admit
this
evidence,
and
you
wish
under
103
to
appeal
that
ruling.
you
can
appeal
the
ruling
if,
and
only
if,
it
affects
a
substantial
right
of
the
defendant,
that
it
substantially
hurt
the
defendant,
the
ruling.
if
the
government
didn't
introduce
it,
it
didn't
hurt
the
defendant.
ah,
but
wait
a
minute.
the
defendant,
because
of
the
threat,
introduced
it
herself,
so
of
course
that
ruling
affected
a
substantial
right.
if
we're
uncertain
about
what
the
government
would
or
wouldn't
do,
i
guess
maybe
it
didn't
affect
a
substantial
right,
but
where
we're
certain,
it
did.
i
think
the
exact
word
is,
a
substantial
right
of
the
party
affected.
now,
that's
how
i've
been
thinking
about
it,
but
don't
let
me
think
that
way
if
i'm
wrong
on
the
basic
concept.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
was
thinking
that
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
ordinarily,
you
would
get
your
appeal,
because
there's
a
ruling
that
affected
a
substantial
right
of
the
defendant,
and
the
reason
it
did
is
because
the
defendant
was
put
to
bringing
out
the
evidence
herself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
let
me
think
this
way
if
i'm
making
some
error
in
the
basic--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
he
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
going
to
say,
he
didn't
have
to
make
the
ruling.
i
mean,
your
argument
i
thought
was
assuming
that
he
has
an
obligation
to
make
that
ruling
in
limine,
and
to
my
knowledge
he
has
no
obligation
to
make
the
rule...
the
rules
allow
him
to
do
so,
but
he
has
no
obligation
to
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
isn't...
why
would
it
be
an
abuse...
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
why
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
he--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
that
what
it
is
likely
to
do
if
you
win
your
case,
or
perhaps
let
me
give
you
a
second
alternative,
or
maybe
a
variant
on
justice
kennedy's.
either
the
judge
is
going
to
say,
look,
i'm
going
to...
i'm
going
to
wait
until
the
evidence
is
offered
before
i
make
a
ruling,
or
the
judge
is
going
to
say,
i
will
entertain
an
in
limine
ruling,
and
i
will
make
one
before
trial,
but
it
is
subject
to
reconsideration
when
we
get
closer
to
the
point
of
introduction,
and
i
will
not
make
a
final
ruling
until
the
moment
comes
that
the
government
offers
it,
because
only
then
can
i
make
the
most
intelligent
judgment
about
the
relative
prejudice
and
probative
force.
that
would
certainly
i
take
it
the
latter
position
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
so
isn't
a
cautious
judge
going
to
take
that
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
tell
me
why...
as
against
the
risk
of
reversal
that
is
the
assumption
of
justice
kennedy's
question
and
mine,
why
is
the
judge
going
to
want
to
go
out
on
the
limb?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
this
matter
that
much?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
same
problem
exactly
arise
if
you
have
your
witness
on
the
stand,
the
defendant's
testifying,
you're
well
into
the
thing,
and
then
you
go
to
the
judge,
say
judge,
excuse
me,
now,
i
have
a
final
question
i
want
to
ask
my
client.
i'm
going
to
elicit
the
information
that
she
has
a
prior
conviction,
and
i'm
going
to
do
that,
but
i'm
not
going
to
do
it...
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
do
it,
but
i'll
do
it
if
you
let
them
cross
examine
and
bring
it
out
on
cross.
now,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
say
yes
or
no.
what's
the
difference
if
he
does
it
at
that
point,
frankly,
or
if
he
did
it
15
minutes
earlier,
or
if
he
did
it
15
hours
earlier?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
suppose...
let's
leave
out
the
definitive
part,
as
follows.
imagine
your
client's
on
the
stand.
the
defendant
is
on
the
stand.
the
defendant
has
now
testified.
the
defendant's
lawyer
says
to
the
judge,
judge,
you
know
perfectly
well
that
the
prosecution
now
is
going
to
introduce
her
prior
drug
conviction.
now,
if
you're
going
to
let
that
in,
i'm
going
to
ask
her
one
final
question
which
will
be,
mrs.
so
and
so,
do
you
have
a
final
drug
conviction,
an
earlier
one,
and
she
will
say,
yes.
so
judge,
i
would
like
to
know
before
asking
that
final
question,
just
one
question
left
to
go,
i
would
like
to
know
how
you're
going
to
rule
when
the
prosecution...
you
intend
to
offer
that,
right?
yes.
all
right.
when
the
prosecution
offers
that
conviction,
now,
that's
my
case.
what's
your
view
on
that
one?
can't...
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
let
the
prosecution
offer
that
conviction.
the
lawyer
says,
mrs.
so
and
so,
do
you
have
a
prior
conviction?
answer,
yes.
the
lawyer
now
wants
to
appeal
the
judge's
ruling,
all
right.
what's
your
view
of
that?
that
gets
all
the
preliminary,
finality,
definitive
parts
out
of
it.
it's
right
in
the
trial.
i
want
to
know,
what's
your
view
of
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no.
i
want
to
know
whether
or
not,
in
that
case,
the
lawyer
can
appeal
or
the
lawyer
cannot
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
finality
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
my
case.
you're
still
not
going
to
let
him,
so
my
question,
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
all
right.
my...
that
would
be
my
question.
my
question
would
be,
an
appeal
is
permitted
where
a
substantial
right
is
affected
as
a
result
of
the
ruling.
the
lawyer
says,
of
course
a
substantial
right
was
affected
as
a
result
of
this
ruling.
you
ruled
that
that
came
in,
and
that
certainly
affected
my
client.
and
your
response
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but
i
mean,
i
want
to
know
why?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
that
would
have
to
be
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
i
agree
that
would
have
to
be
your
answer,
and
then
i
guess
you'd
have
one
further
question,
which
is,
that
sounds
very
metaphysical
to
me.
anyone
who
doesn't
think
that
my
client
wasn't
affected
by
your
ruling
hasn't
been
in
this
trial.
and
you
respond
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
that's
not
a
waiver--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
our
question
is
not
the
correctness
of
the
introduction.
our
question
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
claim
that
it
is
not
correct,
and
i
take
it
that
the
response
to
justice
stevens
would
be,
that
doesn't
waive
anything.
it
may
make
it
more
likely
that
the
admission
ruling
is
correct,
but
certainly
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
raise
the
issue
in
the
appellate
court.
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
happen...
i
don't
know
this.
with
all...
leaving...
with
all
sorts
of
other
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial,
i
mean,
suppose
it's
just
a
relevance
point,
you
know,
and
one
of
the
lawyers,
either
side,
says
judge,
are
you
going
to
let
in
all
that
chicago
stuff,
and
he
says
yeah.
and
then
he
says,
well,
okay
then,
what
i'm
going
to
do
is,
i'm
going
to
try
to
introduce
it
first.
there's
a
definitive
ruling,
you
know,
the
chicago
stuff
will
come
in,
and
so
the
lawyer
whom
that
disfavors
introduces
the
chicago
stuff
himself.
is
that
a
waiver?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
the
case
that
i...
i
just
look
that
up
in
a
regular
treatise.
is
that
just
obvious?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
could
think
it
would
come
up
in
all
kinds
of
conduct...
contexts.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
prior
convictions.
all
sorts
of
trials
are
managed
because...
yeah,
because
you
know,
there's
whole
vast
realms
of
complicated
evidence.
the
judge
makes
preliminary
ruling,
makes
in
limine
rulings,
makes
definitive
rulings,
how
i'm
going
to
run
this
trial,
so
i'd
think
that
there
would
be
stuff
on
the...
in
reaction
to
that,
you
introduce
it
yourself,
whether
you
lose
the
right
that
you'd
otherwise
have
under
the
rules
to
object
to
a
definitive
ruling
by
the
judge
that
hurt
your
client.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
never
rose
in
other
circumstances
that
you
know
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
it
was.
i
thought
the
argument
was,
there
is
a
definitive
ruling
by
the
judge
that
the
rules
give
me
a
right
to
appeal
to
if
it
hurt
me,
and
it
did
hurt
me.
am
i
saying
something
different
than
justice
scalia
said?
