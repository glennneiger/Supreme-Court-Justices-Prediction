ms.
mcdowell,
does
your
position
depend
on
taking
the
view
that
the
judge's
ruling
was
necessarily
tentative?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
very
curious
because,
as
you
know,
there
is
a
proposed
amendment
to
rule...
is
it
103?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
then
will
speak
in
terms
of
definitive
rulings
and
preservation
of
objections
and
so
forth,
so
i
wondered
to
what
extent
your
argument
depends
on
the
notion
that
it's
not
a
definitive
ruling.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can't
this
be
resolved
definitively
by
the
judge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
judge
can't
say,
look,
if
the
government
wants
to
introduce
it,
it
can.
that's
not
definitive?
what's
tentative
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
question--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
question
presented
to
the
judge
is,
by
the
prosecution,
judge,
i
intend
to
offer
evidence
at
trial
of
the
prior
conviction
of
this
defendant.
may
i
do
so?
yes
or
no.
judge
says
yes.
i've
looked
at
it,
you
may
do
so.
that's
not
definitive,
hmm?
