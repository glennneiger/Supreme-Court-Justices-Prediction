chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
98-9828,
maria
suzuki
ohler
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
when
you
say
mitigate
the
sting,
when
she
gets
on
the
stand
and
testifies
herself
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
specific
language
do
you
rely
on
to
support
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
simply
allowed
the
testimony
to
come
in
on
direct
as...
as
well
as
cross.
how
does
that
support
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we've
held,
haven't
we,
that
most
rights
generally
are
waivable?
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
take
a
specific
provision
allowing
waiver
in
the
granting
of
the
right
for
it
to
be
waivable.
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
waiver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
difference
between
a
presumption
in
favor
of
waiver
and
a
presumption
as
to
the
availability
of
waiver?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
isn't
any
presumption
against
waiver
in
general.
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
waiver,
our
cases
say.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
barker
v.
wingo
was
decided
a
long
time
before
the
more
recent
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
government
have
a
similar
right
to
appeal
if
the
trial
court
made
an
adverse
ruling
on
its
informant's
testimony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
the
type
you
described
that
might
be
taken
under
section
3731?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
win
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
good
cause
for
a
district
judge
to
say,
i
will
just...
i
will
never
know
at
the
in
limine
stage
as
much
as
i
do
about
the
state
of
the
record
at
the
time
it's
being
offered,
and
so
i'm
just...
that's
my
good
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
common
law,
they
never
had
in
limine
motions,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
only
rare,
but
nonexistent,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when?
because
you
know,
i
practiced
for
16
years.
it
was
just
unknown
in
my
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coleman.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
a
lawyer
isn't
going
to
get
very
far
if
he
badgers
a
judge
after
the
judge
says,
i
have
made
up
my
mind
and
that's
it.
you
can't
come
back
every
day
and
say
look,
change
your
mind.
you're
not
going
to
do
much
for
your
case
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
on.
if
she
answered
the
question
that...
suggested
by
justice
stevens,
have
you
ever
been
in
trouble
with
the
law
before,
if
she
answered
no,
certainly
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
the
government
could
introduce
that
by
way
of
impeachment--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--without
regard
to
the
introducibility
of
prior
convictions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
mcdowell,
what
was
our
ruling...
what
was
our
holding
in
luce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
know
for
sure
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
take
the
stand
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
coleman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
98-9828
maria
ohler
v.
the
united
states.
maria
ohler
was
arrested
and
charged
with
importation
of
marijuana
and
possession
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute.
before
trial
the
district
court
granted
the
government’s
motion
in
limine
seeking
to
use
ohler’s
earlier
felony
conviction
to
impeach
her
if
she
took
the
stand.
she
did
testify
and
admitted
on
direct
examination
that
she
had
been
previously
convicted
of
possession
of
methamphetamine.
the
jury
convicted
her
on
both
counts.
on
appeal
she
challenged
the
district
court's
in
limine
ruling
admitting
evidence
of
her
prior
felony
conviction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
she
had
waived
her
objection
to
the
ruling
by
introducing
evidence
of
the
prior
conviction
herself
on
direct
examination.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
generally
a
party
introducing
evidence
cannot
complain
on
appeal
that
the
evidence
was
erroneously
admitted.
ohler
argues
that
this
rule
does
not
apply
in
this
situation,
because
it
unfairly
deprives
defendants
of
the
opportunity
to
mitigate
the
affect
of
the
anticipated
impeachment
by
introducing
the
prior
conviction
evidence
themselves
on
direct.
we
do
not
agree
with
this,
both
the
government
and
the
criminal
defendant
have
to
make
certain
choices
during
the
course
of
a
trail,
including
whether
to
introduce
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
prior
conviction.
due
to
the
structure
of
the
trial
the
government
need
not
make
its
decision
until
after
the
defendant
is
testified
and
the
government
has
appraised
the
effect
of
the
defendant’s
testimony.
thus,
any
harm
flowing
from
a
district
court’s
pre-trail
ruling
is
wholly
speculative.
a
defendant
is
harmed
from
an
erroneous
ruling
only
if
the
government
actually
introduces
the
prior
conviction
evidence
on
cross-examination.
in
our
view,
there
is
nothing
unfair
about
applying
the
general
rule
that
a
party
introducing
evidence
cannot
challenge
its
admission
on
appeal
to
this
situation
and
putting
the
defendant
to
a
choice
in
accordance
with
the
normal
rules
of
trial.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
