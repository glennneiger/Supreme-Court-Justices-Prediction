justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know,
i
mean,
you
really...
are
most
rules
of
waiver
reflected
in
the
federal
rules?
i
mean,
what
you
have
here
is
a
criminal
defendant
who
introduces
this
matter
in
the
trial
herself.
how
can
she
complain
of
its
introduction?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
presuming
waiver
when
it's
your
client
herself
that
put
the
evidence
in.
how
can
she
possibly
complain
about
the
government's
introducing
the
evidence
when
she
herself
took
the
initiative
in
introducing
it?
i...
that's
not
a
hard
question
as
far
as
the
issue
of
waiver
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
might
have
decided
that
its
case
was
strong
enough
that
it
wouldn't
take
a
chance
on
the
ruling
and
wouldn't
introduce
the
evidence.
she
took
that
option
away
from
the
government
by
leaping
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
it
knew
how
the
trial
had
gone.
it
might
have
concluded,
after
seeing
how
strong
its
case
looked
and
how
well
its
witnesses
did,
not
to
take
a
chance
on
this,
that
we
didn't
need
it
anyway.
why
should
it
be
precluded
from
deciding
not
to
introduce
it
by
her
jumping
the
gun?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
coleman,
you
sort
of
assume
throughout
all
of
this
that
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
price
for
removing
the
sting.
you
assume
some
absolute
right
to
remove
the
sting,
and
you
should
not
lose
anything
by
removing
the
sting.
i
don't
know
why
there's
that
principle
in
our
law.
let's
assume
the
defendant
knows
that
the
government's
going
to
introduce,
you
know,
a
bloody
shirt,
so
in
order
to
remove
the
sting,
the
defendant
himself
introduces
the
bloody
shirt.
now,
you
really
think
that
we
would
entertain
an
argument,
well,
after
all,
the
defendant
only
introduced
it
because
he
knew
the
government
was
going
to
introduce
it,
and
therefore
you
shouldn't
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
objection
to
it.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
a
sensible
principle.
if
you
want
to
remove
the
sting,
remove
it,
but
don't
come
to
the
court
and
then
say,
we
have
an
objection
to
what
we
ourselves
have
put
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
that's
the
normal
rule.
you
have
no
basis
for
objecting
to
stuff
that
you've
put
in
yourself.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
you
would
have
to
spell
that
out
in
order
for
that
rule
to
be
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
defer
it
from
when?
i
mean,
may
only
defer
it
for
a
good
cause,
to
be
sure,
defer
it
from
the
point
at
which
he
should
have
made
the
ruling,
but
really
the
normal
procedure
is
to
make
the
ruling
when
the
matter
comes
up,
and
it's
really
a
novel...
in
the
history
of
civil
procedure,
a
novel
arrangement
to
have
all
of
these
things
presented
before
the
trial,
just
a
matter
of
efficiency.
but
the
normal,
and
the
final
ruling
on
whether
to
exclude
or
omit
evidence
is
when
it's
introduced,
and
rule
12
applies
to
the
judge
saying,
you
know,
when
it's
introduced,
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
properly
let
in
or
not.
bring
it
in
now
and
i'll
think
about
it
later,
and
i'll
instruct
the
jury
that
it
should
have
been
admitted.
that's
deferring
the
ruling.
but
here,
he
made
the
ruling--
justice
antonin
scalia
would
he
have
to
say
yes
or
no?
i
would
say,
you
know,
it's
up
to
you.
you
want
to
introduce
evidence,
introduce
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
evidence
that
you
introduce,
you
can't
complain
about.
i
am
still
unable
to
understand
what
seems
to
me
the
premise
of
your
whole
case,
and
that
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
eliminate
the
sting
without
paying
a
penalty
for
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
normal
rule
is,
you
introduce
evidence,
you
have
no
right
to
complain
about
the
introduction
of
that
evidence,
and
your
response
to
that
is,
oh,
well,
i'm
only
doing
it
to...
quote,
to
eliminate
the
sting.
i
don't
care
why
you
did
it.
you
put
it
in.
why
do
you
have
a
special
right
to
eliminate
the
sting?
it
seems
to
me
you
take
your
chance.
if
you
want
to
eliminate
the
sting,
you
don't
complain
about
the
admission
on
the
government's
part.
if
you're
confident
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
let
in,
then
you
cannot
eliminate
the
sting.
what
is
so
evil
about
make...
putting
you
to
that
choice?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
always
change
his
mind
later,
even
if
he...
i
know
i
said
it
was
definitive--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
hadn't
seen
all
the
evidence,
and
i've...
you
know,
i've
reconsidered
it.
until
it's
put
in,
it's
not
really
final,
is
it,
until
he
does
allow
the
evidence
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ruling...
i
think
your
answer
is
that
the
ruling
didn't
affect...
didn't
affect
the
client
at
all.
what
affected
the
client
was
the
evidence
that
the
client,
client's
lawyer
himself--
justice
antonin
scalia
--introduced.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
ultimately
the
client
who
put
in
the
evidence,
and
that's
what
hurt
the
client,
not
the
ruling.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
his
lawyer
could
ask
her,
you're
not
an
angel,
are
you?
she
says,
no,
i'm
not
an
angel.
you
don't
pretend
to
be
an
angel,
do
you?
no,
i
don't
pretend
to
be
an
angel.
but
just
not
actually
introduce
the
conviction.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
rather...
is
it
your
proposal
that
is
hypothetical,
or
is
it
the
other
one
that
was
hypothetical?
i
think
the
objection
being
made
here
by
the
defendant
is
that
if
he
had
known
that
this
evidence
would
not
be
introduced,
he
would
not
have
introduced
it,
and
therefore
his
introduction
of
it
should
be
forgiven
and
should
not
be
a
waiver.
is
that
not
the
defendant's
argument
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it--
