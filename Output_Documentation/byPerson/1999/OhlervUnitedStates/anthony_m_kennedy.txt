justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
even
if
that's
true,
it
wouldn't
quite
answer
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
raised.
i
want
to
go
back
to
that
for
just
a
moment.
in
your
colloquy
you
said,
well,
there's
no
question
but
that
the
government
would
have
used
this
in
its
case.
is
the
rule
you're
proposing
one
in
which
there...
if
there
is
some
question
whether
the
government
would
introduce
the
evidence,
there
should
be
some
sort
of
different
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
a
trial
judge
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
every
criminal
trial,
it's
a
matter
of
policy
in
this
court
that
i
will
not
make
advance
rulings
on
prior
convictions?
if
and
when
the
government
brings
up
the
prior
conviction,
then
i'll
make
my
ruling,
not
before.
abuse
of
discretion
if
your
rule
prevails,
and
if
you
win?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
district
court
says,
i'm
going
to...
my
good
cause
is,
i
might
get
reversed
if
i
make
a
mistake.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
along
that
line,
can
you
tell
me,
and
this
relates
to
an
observation
justice
scalia
made.
in
the
civil
area,
with
pre
trial
orders,
in
limine
rulings
shaped
the
whole
course
of
the
civil
case.
are
there
many
in
limine
rulings
in
criminal
cases?
is
there
always
a
conference
in
chambers,
and
there
are
four
or
five
in
limine
rulings
made?
just...
can
you
give
me
some
practical
sense
of
how
often
this
happens--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
areas
other
than
prior
convictions,
as
well
as
prior
convictions.
--of
course,
i
can
give
you
a
flavor
of
what
occurs
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
i'm
not
quite
certain
as
to
other
districts,
but
there
are
many
in
limine
rulings
that
are
brought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
in
some
of
the
other
in
limine
ruling
areas
that
we
were
discussing?
suppose
the
defense
said
now,
your
honor...
at
a
pretrial
hearing...
i
want
the
government
instructed
right
now
they're
not
to
introduce
hair
sample
evidence.
the
hair
was
found
too
far
from
the
scene,
and
so
on,
and
the
judge
said,
i'm
going
to
admit
it.
can
the
defendant
then,
in
the
defendant's
own
case,
introduce
the
hair
sample
and...
evidence
and
an
expert
who
said
it's
not
the
defendant's,
or
would
that
be
a
waiver
under
your
principle?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
don't
know
any
case
in
which
the
in
limine
ruling
entitles
the
defendant
to
anticipate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
wait,
you
just
wait
for
the
rebuttal
stage
of
the...
the
defendant
should
wait
for
the
rebuttal
stage
of
the
case.
but
that
case
couldn't
arise,
could
it,
because
the
evidence
of
guilt
has
to
be
put
in
by
the
prosecution
first,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
chance
to
put
in--
--well,
the
defendant
might
do
it
on
cross.
--isn't
that
right?
isn't
that
why
those
cases
don't
arise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
an
impeachment
context,
sure,
i
understand
that.
but
as
to
the
main
case
you
just
don't
have
that
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
isn't
that
the
thrust
of
rule...
the
proposed
rule
103,
which
is
at
a-5
of
the
blue
brief?
proposed
rule
103,
and
i
know
that
it's
not
applicable
in
this
case,
but
it
indicates
what
perhaps
is
the
better
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says,
once
the
court
makes
a
definitive
ruling,
it
assumes
there
is
such
an
animal
as
a
definitive
ruling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
other
words
there's
now
going
to
be
a
whole
classification
of
rulings
that
by
their
nature
cannot
be
definitive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i've
read
the
notes,
but
i'm
concerned
with
the
text
of
the
ruling.
it
does
seem
to
me
to
contradict
your
position
if
you
don't
look
at
the
advisory
notes.
would
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--agree
that
it's
more
helpful
to
the
petitioner
than
it
is
to
you,
absent
the
advisory
comments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
civil
area
all
the
time
this
happens.
i
say
in
a
condemnation
case,
your
honor...
the
pretrial...
i
don't
think
we
should
have
valuation
testimony
about
property
on
the
far
side
of
the
river,
and
the
judges
says,
you're
wrong
about
that.
we're
going
to
have
it.
i
take
it
that
i
don't
waive
my
objection
if
i'm
the
first
one
to
introduce
comparable
sales
in
my
part
of
the
case,
and
you
seem
to
be
arguing
for
a
somewhat
different
theory.
is
it
because
of
the
nature
of
the
ruling?
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
evidence
that
you
want
to
introduce?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
hypothetical
justice
breyer
put,
where
just
at
the
close
of
the
direct
examination
of
the
defendant
by
the
defendant's
own
attorney
he
says,
there's
one
more
question,
and
the
judge
turns
in
a...
what
do
they
call
these
now
+/?
sidebar
to
the
prosecution
and
says,
now,
do
you
propose
to
introduce
the
prior
conviction,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
wait
and
see.
can
the
prosecutor
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
forthright
prosecutor
who
knows
that
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
introduce
the
statement
should
say,
well,
yes,
judge,
i'm
going
to
do
it
no
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
one
of
the
problems
with
luce
was
that
if
the
court
had
ruled
the
other
way,
every
defendant
would
have
announced
that
but
for
the
ruling
he
would
have
taken
the
stand.
he
would
be
given
a,
sort
of
a
free
appeal.
here,
you
know
the
defendant's
taking
the
stand,
so
at
least
that
uncertainty
is
eliminated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
makes
this
a
harder
case
than
luce,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
she
doesn't,
luce
applies.
