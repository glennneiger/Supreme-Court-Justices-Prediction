justice

paul

it
seems
to
me
the
real
world
scenario
is,
if
the
government
has
such
a
strong
case
it
doesn't
need
to
use
it,
at
the
end
of
its
case
it
simply
advises
the
judge,
i've
decided
not
to
use
this
impeaching
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
they
would
avoid
this
risk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
another
reason
too,
mr.
coleman.
i
don't
think
all
our
district
judges
are
nearly
as
timid
as
my
colleagues
seem
to
suggest.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
they
weren't
when
i
was
trying
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
constitute
a
waiver
under
your
view,
if
the
defense
lawyer
asked
her--
[laughter]
--if...
have
you
had...
have
you
ever
been
in
trouble
with
the
law
before,
but
not
asking
any
specific...
would
that
constitute
a
waiver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
be
a
waiver.
if
you
said,
have
you
ever
been--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--maybe
we
have
the
same
kind
of
problem
here
as
whether
the
trial
judge's
ruling
is
definitive
or
not.
we
get
the
same
gray
area
as
to
when
the
waiver
takes
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
be
benefit...
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's
really
made
with
the
implicit
understanding
that
this
is
the
rule
for
this
trial.
we
don't
have
in
limine
motions
and
say,
well,
we'll
see
what
happens
later
on.
i
mean,
you
run
a
trial
with
some
firmness
on
how
the
thing
is
going
to
go.
most
trial
judges
don't
say,
i'm
going
to
rule
this
way,
but
maybe
i'll
change
my
mind
tomorrow.
that's
not
the
way
we
want
our
trial
judges
to
conduct
trials,
certainly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
not
the
most
complex
issue
in
the
world,
either.
this
is
a
very
simple
evidentiary
issue
that
he
can
affect
both
sides
on,
the
kind
of
thing
you
ought
to
get
a
firm
ruling
out
of
the
trial
judge
that
the
parties
can
rely
on.
it
certainly
doesn't
advance
trial
process
to
say,
everything's
tentative.
