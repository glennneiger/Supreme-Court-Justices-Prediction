mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
a
pro
se
waiver
rule.
under
all
circumstances,
a
defendant
waives
her
right
to
seek
any
appellate
review
of
her
objection
to
a
district
court's
ruling
admitting
her
prior
conviction
for
impeachment
purposes
if
she
attempts
to
mitigate
the
sting
of
that
evidence.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--correct.
the
ninth
circuit
has
articulated
this
rule,
although
it
has
relied
on
no
specific
language
in
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
or
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
indeed,
the
solicitor
general
appears
to
concede
that
there
is
no
such
specific
language
supporting
such
a
rule.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
we
rely
on
the
1990
amendment
to
rule
609,
which
specifically
removed
the
cross
examination
limitation
with
respect
to
when
evidence
could
be
admitted
under
rule
609.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
we
believe
it
supports
our
position
because
we
do
not
think
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
lay
a
trap
for
the
unwary
to
on
the
one
hand
specifically
authorize
attempts
to
mitigate
the
sting,
but
on
the
other
hand
silently
provide
for
the
fact
that
such
attempts,
which
are
authorized,
constitute
waivers
of
the
right
to
appeal
without
making
any
such
indication
in
the
rules
of
evidence.
in
addition,
we
also
rely
on
rule
103.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
with
respect
to
the
first
part
of
the
question,
i
believe
that
usually
the
waiver
rules
are
incorporated
in
the
federal
rules.
for
example,
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
12
has
a
specific
provision
which
indicates
when
a
party
specifically
waives
any
objections.
with
respect
to,
how
can
a
defendant
actually
introduce
the
evidence
and
yet
seek
to
appeal
it,
she
is
only
introducing
the
evidence
after
she
has
articulated
an
objection,
that
objection
has
been
overruled,
and
the
only
possible
reason
why
she
would
be
admitting
that
evidence
is
because
the
objection
is
overruled.
no
criminal
defendant
in
their
right
mind
would
seek
to
put
in
evidence
of
a
prior
conviction.
that's
extremely
damaging
evidence,
and
nobody
would
ever
seek
to
do
that.
in
addition--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i
believe
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
availability
of
waiver.
that
does
not
mean
that
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
waiver.
in
fact,
i
think
the
presumption--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--the
difference
is
that
with
respect
to
a
presumption
of
the
availability
of
waiver,
that
means
that
unless
there
is
a
specific
provision
saying
that
you
cannot
waive
this,
no
ifs,
ands,
or
buts,
waiver
is
available.
however,
if
the
presumption
against
waiver
in
general
means
that
if
the
rules
are
silent,
for
example,
you
should
presume
that
there
will
be
no--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i
believe
barker
v.
wingo
says
that
the
presumption
is
against
waiver.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
that
is
true.
barker
v.
wingo
was
a
1972
case.
however,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
overruling
that
proposition.
admittedly,
mezzanatto
says
that
waiver
is
presumptively
available,
but
i
don't
believe
that
mezzanatto
took
the
additional
step
to
overrule
barker
v.
wingo
and
to
indicate
that
not
only
is
waiver
presumptively
available,
but
we
also
are
going
to
presume
waiver.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
again,
if
she
had
not
objected
beforehand
to
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
and
received
a
ruling
beforehand,
then
i
agree,
she
would
have
waived,
but
in
this
instance
the
only
reason
why
she
is
putting
in
the
evidence
is
because
she
has
articulated
an
objection,
that
objection
has
been
overruled.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
believe
on
the
record
that
we
have
here
there
was
absolutely
no
question
that
the
government
was
going
to
use
this
conviction.
the
government
affirmatively
moved
to
admit
the
conviction,
as
opposed
to
a
motion
to
exclude
the
conviction.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
think
that
your
honor
is
articulating
a
policy
concern
that
was
articulated
in
luce
v.
united
states.
i
believe
that
luce
indicates
that
when
a
defendant
does
not
testify,
an
appellate
court
cannot
determine
for
sure
whether
a
prosecutor
would
have
used
the
prior
conviction.
however,
when
the
defendant
does
testify,
an
appellate
court
can
review
the
full
and
complete
record,
which
includes
the
defendant's
testimony,
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
government's
case
was
so
strong
that
it
never
would
have
used
the
conviction.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
he
could
have
done
that.
however,
i
don't
think
that
such
a
sidebar
or
such
a
colloquy
is
required,
especially
given
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
given
the
government's
motion
to
admit
the
evidence,
and
their
claim
that
such
evidence
was
critical
and...
it
was
important
and
critical
evidence
and,
in
addition,
the
district
court
was
clear
that
it
was
going
to
rule
that
the
prior
conviction
was
admissible.
in
fact,
on
the
day
that
the
defendant
testified,
the
district
court
specifically
warned
defense
counsel
that
obviously
the
prior
conviction
was
admissible,
so
in
these
particular
circumstances,
i
do
not
think
that
such
a
scenario
was
required.
however--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i
believe
if
the
government
articulates
a
question
as
to
whether
they
are
going
to
admit
the
evidence
beforehand,
then
that
would
be
a
different
result,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
don't
believe
so,
for
essentially
three
reasons.
number
1,
of
course
the
government
has
to
be
honest
with
the
court.
they
can't
just
say
something
that's
dishonest.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
well,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
government
won't
always
do
that.
number
1,
if
the
government
expresses
any
hesitation
as
to
whether
it's
going
to
use
the
conviction,
certainly
it
couldn't
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
under
section
3731
of
the
district
court's
ruling
excluding
the
evidence.
they
would
have
had
to
make
it--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--exactly.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
exactly,
and
we
do
believe
it's
the
government's
burden.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
well,
for...
specifically
with
respect
to
rule
609
evidence,
again,
i
think
it
does
come
back
to
the
1990
amendment
to
rule
609.
if
congress
intended
that
a
defendant
should
have
to
give
something
up
in
order
to
remove
the
sting,
one
would
think
that
congress
would
have
said
so,
rather
than
just
specifically
authorizing
such
attempts
to
mitigate
the
sting.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
we
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
normal
rule,
that
in
fact
the
second
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuits
before
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
were
enacted
had
specifically
indicated
that
there
was
no
waiver
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
agree
with
the
basic
concept
that
if
there's
a
case
where
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
that
an
appellate
court
would
take
a
look
at
this
and
say,
well,
maybe
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
used
the
conviction,
in
any
event
that
error
is
going
to
be
harmless
anyhow.
it's
not
going
to
affect
a
substantial
right.
i
do
agree
that
the
rule
103
substantially
affecting
language
overlaps.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
certainly
agree
with--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
no,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
in
response
in
our
reply
brief
we
cited
a
study
that
conducted
empirical
studies
which
contradicted
the
one
article
cited
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
addition,
i
believe
that
your
honor's
opinion
in
old
chief
talks
about
the
devastating
effect
that
a
litigant
can
have
if
the
jury
perceives
that
litigant
as
hiding
something
from
them,
so
i
think
that
the
court
has
embodied
the
mitigating
the
sting
principle
in
its
jurisprudence.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
do
think
you
got
it
right,
and
i
think
that
congress
has
indicated
that
you
got
it
right,
because
they
specifically
authorized
such
attempts
to
mitigate
the
sting,
and--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--that's
correct,
and
it's
standard
operating
procedure
for
government
trial
attorneys
when
they
use
an
informant
or
a
cooperating
witness.
they
often
attempt
to
mitigate
the
sting,
and
we
cited
some
cases
in
our
briefs,
and
that's
standard
operating
procedure
for
both
parties,
and
it's
something
that
you
learn
as
a
trial
lawyer,
or
one
of
the
first
things.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
no.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
once
jeopardy
has
attached,
they
couldn't
appeal
under--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--the
problem
is
that
under
3731
it
says
that
the
government
can
appeal
a
ruling
that
either
excludes
or
suppresses
evidence.
if
a
district
court
admits
a
prior
conviction
of
a
government
witness,
then
i
don't
believe
they
could
appeal
under
3731.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
we
certainly
couldn't
take
an
interlocutory
appeal,
but
we
would
be
able
to
appeal
after
the
final
judgment.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
correct.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
i
don't
believe
so,
because
again
the
distinction
between
the
forfeiture
and
the
waiver
would
be
that
under
forfeiture
we
at
least
would
have
been
able
to
obtain
plain
error
review
on
appeal,
but
what
the
government
is
arguing
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
that
we're
not
entitled
to
any
review
whatsoever,
and
that's
why
it's
waiver,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
the
government
is
simply
arguing
forfeiture.
they're
actually
endorsing
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
that
we
don't
get
any
appellate
review
at
all,
which
is
a
waiver.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
say
whether
it
would
be
abuse
of
discretion.
i
do
think
that
the
district
court,
making
that
per
se
blanket
statement
that
it
will
never,
ever
consider
a
ruling,
could
be
violating
rule
12(e).
rule
12(e)
says
that
a
district
court
can
only
defer
a
ruling
for
a
good
cause.
now,
there
may
be
an
almost...
in
a
wide
variety
of
rule
609
cases
that
the
district
court
will,
in
fact,
have
good
cause,
but
to
simply
make
the
blanket
statement--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--we
do
believe
he
did
make
a
ruling
for
purposes
of
rule
103
and
in
order
to
obtain
appellate
review--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
no,
i
hope
i
didn't
misspeak.
we
agree,
he
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
render
the
ruling
at
the
in
limine
stage.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
the
only
way
i
could
ever
foresee
that
being
abuse
of
discretion
is,
the
way
he
posed
the
hypothetical,
a
district
court
judge
says,
i
am
never,
ever
going
to
consider
this,
consider
a
rule
609
issue
at
the
in
limine
stage,
and
the
only
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
such
a
blanket
statement
could
potentially
violate
rule
12(e),
because
rule
12(e)
says
that
motions
that
are
made
before
trial
should
be
entertained
before
trial
unless
the
court
for
good
cause
feels
it
needs
to
determine--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i
agree,
that
generally
will
be...
that
will
be
enough.
that
will
be
good
cause,
and
in
almost
all
cases,
if
the
district
court
wants
to
defer,
it
certainly
has
the
power
to
defer.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
a
judge
could
take
that
position.
however,
i
don't
think
that
judges
will
always
do
that
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
judge
will
want
to
render
a
definitive
rule
609
ruling
or
other
in
limine
ruling
before
trial.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
number
1,
the
judge--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--the
judge
may
believe
that
a
definitive
ruling
at
the
in
limine
stage
will
help
the
parties
settle
the
case,
so
he
doesn't
even
have
to
go
through
a
whole
trial
and
then
an
appeal.
a
judge
may
think
that
in
fairness
the
parties
should
have
such
a
ruling
so
that
if
the
government
wants
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
they
can,
or
if
the
defendant
wants
to
be
able
to
figure
out
his
trial
strategy
throughout
the
trial
he
can
do
that.
a
judge--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i
agree,
and
i
can
attest
to
that.
they--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--and
it
hasn't
changed.
they
have
no
problem
making
definitive
rulings
and
letting
you
know--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--of
course,
i
can
give
you--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
in
fact,
if
you
notice
in
this
case,
the
district
court
specifically
said
an
in
limine
hearing,
because
that
is
the
normal
course
in
criminal
cases
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
in
limine
motions
are
brought
with
respect
to
expert
testimony.
the
government
these
days
uses
expert
testimony
in
all
sorts
of
cases.
as
you
indicated,
404(b)
and
609
issues
are
usually
dealt
with
at
the
in
limine
stage.
you
know,
again,
after
old
chief
there
may
be
certain
rule
403
issues
that
are
going
to
be
dealt
with
at
the
in
limine
stage.
so
there
are
a
variety
of
issues
that
are
dealt
with
at
the
in
limine
stage,
and--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--i
agree,
i
don't
think
there
is
too
much--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--the
reason
why
i
believe
that
we
do
have
a
right
is
because,
again,
in
1990
congress
specifically
amended
rule
609
to
say
you
have
a
right
to
do
that,
so
that's
why
i
believe
we
do
have
a
right.
and
in
addition,
again
it's
our
position
that
there
wasn't
a
general
rule
before
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
were
enacted
if
you
look
at
the
common
law,
that
if
you
brought
in
the
conviction
first,
you
waived
your
right
to
appeal
and,
in
fact,
the
second
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
held
to
the
contrary,
and
a
revised
version
of
wigmore--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--at
the...
if
you
take
the
common
law
taking
it
all
the
way
back,
in
limine
motions
were
rare.
however,
as
you
get
closer--
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
--at
one
time
they
were
nonexistent,
but
as
you
take
that
closer
to
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
in
limine
motions
did
become
a
habit
within
trial
courts,
you
know,
in
the
united
states.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
well,
we
look
at
the
cases,
for
example,
united
states
v.
maynard
and
united
states
v.
puco,
where
this
specific
type
of
issue
with
respect
to
prior
conviction
evidence
was
addressed
at
the
in
limine
stage,
and
the
district
court
made
rulings
thereon.
mr.
benjamin
l.
coleman
we
certainly
agree,
and
that
hits
home
with
our
point
with
respect
to
rule
102,
that
one
of
the
purposes
in
construing
the
rules
that
rule
102
indicates
is
that
we
should
further
the
progress
and
development
of
the
law
of
evidence.
and
this
is
a
classic
case,
where
the
district
court
had
real
trouble
determining
whether
a
prior
conviction
for
simple
possession
of
drugs
is
probative
of
veracity,
and
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
reason
why
we
do
not
want
to
have
blanket
waivers
of
the
right
to
appeal.
there
will
be
no
development
of
the
rule
609
case
law
under
those
circumstances,
so
we
certainly
do
agree
with
that.
your
honors,
if
there
are
no
