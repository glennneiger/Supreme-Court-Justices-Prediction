we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-502,
donald
e.
nelson
v.
adams
usa.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
ms.
dixon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
your
constitutional
claim
raised
before
the
federal
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that's
true
of
our
practice.
if
it
appears
in
the
majority
opinion
one
needn't
go
further,
because
even
if
the
majority
opinion
discussed
it
without
having
been
raised
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
it,
but
if
it's
not
discussed
in
the
majority
opinion
and
wasn't
raised
in
the
brief,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
it's
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what's
your
authority
for
that,
that
proposition
that
you
just
stated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
a
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
dixon.
mr.
wheat,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
at
page
23
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
under...
where
they
have
the
discussion
section,
the
second
paragraph,
it's
talking
about
what
nelson
contends.
it
says
he
can't
be
responsible
individually
for
paying
the
fee
award.
such
a
prohibition
against
assessing
attorney's
fees
against
a
nonparty
he
seeks
to
fashion
from
language
in
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
kentucky
v.
graham.
there
he
was
certainly
complaining
about
an
award
against
him
having
been
made
when
he
was
not
a
party,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
the
question
here
is
really,
you
know,
anyone
who
is...
you
make
a
claim
against...
under
substantive
law.
you
have
to
make
the
claim
and
give
them
an...
you
know,
notice
that
the
claim
is
being
made
against
them,
and
give
them
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
defend
themselves.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is...
i
understood
from
the
briefs,
or
perhaps
from
the
lower
court
opinion,
that
you
make
no
claim
here
to
piercing
the
corporate
veil?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wheat.
ms.
dixon,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dixon.
the
case
is
submitted.
