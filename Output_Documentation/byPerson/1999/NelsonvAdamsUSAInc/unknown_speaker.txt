i
gather
that
they're
saying,
anyway,
that
the
service

process
issue
is
not
properly
before
us.

well,
of
course,
285
does
mention
parties.
it
mentions
prevailing
party,
and
i
suppose
your
argument
would
be
that
he
would
say
this
means
that
the
nonprevailing
party
is
the
one
who
has
to
pay
the
fees,
and
he's
not
a
nonprevailing
party
under
285.
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
all
events,
i
take
it
that
he
could
be
a
nonprevailing
party
for
two
reasons:
1)
that
he
just
doesn't
fit
within
the
purpose
and
intent
of
285
as
a
substantive
matter;
2)
he
could
be
a
nonprevailing
party
because
he
wasn't
in
the
litigation
as
a
matter
of
due
process.

in
other
words,
the
answer
by
motion
or
by
answer
to
the
complaint,
rule
12
is
the
rule
in
question,
and
rule
12
says
you
can
make
a
motion
in
advance
of
answering
the
complaint,
or
you
can
answer
the
complaint,
so
rule
12
is
set
up
to
deal
with
the
case
where
a
complaint
was
filed,
and
then
it
says
you
respond
to
that
complaint
either
by
pre
answer,
motion,
or
by
answer.
