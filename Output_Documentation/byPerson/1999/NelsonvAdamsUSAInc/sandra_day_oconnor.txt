ms.
dixon,
i
take
it
that
you
don't
challenge
the
fact
that
the
pleadings
were
amended
to
add
the
petitioner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
any
objection
made
below
at
that
time
to
the
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
that
can
be
waived.
that
can
be
waived.
do
you
concede
that?
the
lack
of
service
and
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
can
be
waived,
can
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
courts
have
said
that
when
such
a
person
makes
an
appearance
and
files
a
pleading,
that
constitutes
a
waiver,
and
that's
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
process
do
you
say
is
due
before
someone
can
be
made
a
party
to
amend,
to
bring
someone
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
a
complaint
has
to
be
filed
to
accord
due
process
before
a
complaint
can
be
amended
to
bring
somebody
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
it
was--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
would
have
thought
it
was
fairly
fundamental
under
due
process
that
you
have
to
have
a
complaint
that
names
the
party,
and
serve
the
party
with
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
133?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
clarify
for
me
why,
in
your
petition
for
cert,
you
said
that
petitioner
does
not
challenge
the
district
court's
decision
to
grant
respondents
leave
to
amend
the
complaint
and
to
join
petitioner
as
a
new
party
defendant,
and
to
do
so
after
judgment
had
been
rendered?
i
mean,
there
we
are.
so
that
isn't
some
kind
of
a
waiver?
