justice
antonin
scalia
--your
client
wasn't
there
below.
that's
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
client
couldn't
have
waived
it
below,
because
your
client
hadn't
been
served
and
therefore
was
not
present.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
dixon,
i
think
we
may
be
talking
at
cross
purposes
here.
there
are
really
two
separate
issues.
one
is
simply
the
question
of
whether
he
was
there,
whether
he
was
in
the
case.
that
is
the
precise
point
that
he
made
when
he
filed
his
pleading.
he
said,
you
can't
enter
this
judgment
against
me
because
i
wasn't
there.
there's
a
second
issue,
which
is
whether,
if
the
court
did
enter
a
judgment
against
him
when
he
wasn't
there,
it
would
violate
the
constitution.
now,
he
did
not
raise
those
constitutional
arguments
when
he
first
appeared,
but
he
did
raise
the
argument,
i'm
not
here.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
making
some
appearance.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
motion
just
didn't
float
down
from
nobody.
he's
either
making
a
general
appearance
or
a
special
appearance.
which
one
would
you
rather
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
that
extraordinary.
these
things
are
central
to
both
sides,
and
the
briefs
on
both
sides
go
into
these
things,
and
we
don't
have
the
documents
in
front
of
us.
i
don't
know
how
you
selected
what
goes
into
the
appendix.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
285.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
any
other
way
to
reasonably
interpret
his
first
appearance.
as
you
describe
it,
he
could
not
be
held
liable
under
section
285
because
he
was
not
a
party.
now,
there's
nothing
in
section
285
that
mentions
party.
i
mean,
he's
appealing
to
a
general
principle
that
you
can't
be
held
liable
in
a
piece
of
litigation,
whether
it
involves
285
or
anything
else,
unless
you're
a
party.
now,
that...
you
know,
that
sounds
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--like
a
jurisdictional
objection.
what
else
was
he
objecting
to?
was
he
referring
to
some
language
in
285?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
think
you
want
to
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
the
first
question
presented
here,
too,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
the
first
question
on
which
we
granted
cert.--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
dixon,
how
do
you
explain
the
statement
by
the
trial
court
here
on
your
later
application
for
a
60(b)
motion?
in
denying
it,
the
court
says
this:
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
provide
that
a
challenge
to
personal
jurisdiction,
insufficiency
of
process,
or
insufficiency
of
service
of
process
is
waived
if
not
made
in
the
party's
first
responsive
pleading
or
motion.
it
is
not
disputed
that
nelson
did
not,
in
any
of
his
prior
pleadings,
make
the
objections
he
now
seeks
to
raise,
that
is,
personal
jurisdiction,
insufficiency
of
process,
or
insufficiency
of
service
of
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
well,
i
mean,
it
seems
a
reasonable
rule
laid
down
in
that
denial
of
the
motion
that
the
federal
rules
provide
that
these
defenses
are
waived
if
not
made
in
the
party's
first
responsive
pleading
or
motion,
and
you're
saying
that
you
didn't
have
to
make
those
defenses
in
your
first
motion?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
consider
your
first,
your
april
8
appearance
a
special
appearance
when
you
made
two
arguments,
the
first
one
of
which
is
obviously
to
the
merits,
namely,
section
285
does
not
allow
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
an
individual
who
engaged
in
inequitable
conduct?
that's
certainly
a
general
appearance.
