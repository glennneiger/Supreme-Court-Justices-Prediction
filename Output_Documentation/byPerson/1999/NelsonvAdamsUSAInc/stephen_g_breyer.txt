justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what's
bothering
me
about
the
case,
because
it
seems
that
the
obvious
objection
would
be
that
it
wasn't...
that
justice
didn't
require
the
amendment
under
rule
15.
that's
the
objection
that
wasn't
made.
instead
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
wasn't
service
of
process,
there
wasn't
jurisdiction,
and
those
things
seem
either
waived,
or...
they
seem
waived,
basically,
so
the
issue
that
should
be
here
isn't
here,
the
issue
that
shouldn't
be
here
is
here,
and
there
i
am,
stuck.
and
now,
how
do
you
get
me
out
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that
may
be,
but
unfortunately
i
gather
that
that
issue
is
waived.
i
mean,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
is
it
here?
i
mean,
did
you
raise
the
objection
below?
did
you
say,
judge,
in
the
district
court,
my
client
has
not
been
served
with
process
and
therefore--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
misspoke.
it's
the
jurisdiction,
i
gather,
that
they're
saying
is
waived.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
just
elaborate
just
a
minute
on...
i
thought
that...
i
mean,
i
completely
agree
with
you,
obviously
if
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
a
human
being,
you
cannot
make
that
human
being
do
anything,
but
i
think
that
they...
what
the
other
side
was
saying
is
that
there
is
jurisdiction
over
your
client
for
the
following
reason.
at
some
point,
he
appeared.
when
he
appeared
in
the
case...
i
can't
tell
you,
i'm
not
that
familiar
to
know
just
when
he
did.
when
he
appeared
with
the
case,
he
mentioned
nothing
about
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
he
made
a
few
substantive
defenses,
and
if
in
fact
you're
going
to
make
an
appearance
and
you
don't
raise
the
issue,
and
you're
there
in
court,
that
in
effect
waives
your
claim
as
to
jurisdiction.
you
didn't
make
a
special
appearance.
you...
and
i
thought
that
was
basically
the
law,
and
so
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you'll
be
more
familiar
with
their
argument
from
their
brief,
frankly,
than
i
will.
you've
probably
read
it
several
times,
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
refer
to.
they
say
he
appeared
at
some
point,
and
when
he
appeared
at
that
point
in
this
case,
he
didn't
raise
the
jurisdictional
defenses
or
lack
of
notice
defense
and,
because
he
didn't
raise
them,
but
responded
on
the
merits,
he
basically
has
waived
his
defense
of
no
jurisdiction,
because
he's
there,
or
they
made
it
approximately
like
that.
i'm
referring
to
their
argument,
not
to
my
argument,
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
response
is
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suppose
that
that's
an...
now
i'm
not
certain
about
what
the
law
is
on
that.
i
mean,
he...
in
other
words,
the...
of
course
he
wasn't
a
party.
the
issue
is
to
make
him
a
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
therefore
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
has...
should
make
him
a
party.
now,
if
you
say,
i'm
not
a
party,
don't
make
me
a
party,
does
that
waive
your
juris...
i
don't
know,
does
it
waive
your
jurisdictional
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
worrying
me
about
that
argument
is,
there's
a
lot
of
authority
that
a
prevailing
party
is
a
person
who
gets
the
practical
thing
he
wanted
as
against,
let's
say,
the
defendant,
and
so
if
it
was
proper
to
make
him
a
defendant,
or
the
effect
thereof,
i
wouldn't
want
to
undercut
that
law
and
say
that
the...
you
know,
if
he
really...
if
it
was
proper
to
make
him
the
opposite
side...
didn't
they
get
the
practical
relief
they
wanted
as
against
him--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i.e.
that
the...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason...
all
these
considerations
you
brought
up,
what's
bothering
me
at
the
bottom
of
this
is
that
there
seems
to
me
an
obvious
rules
based
vehicle
for
you
to
make
your
argument.
you
would
just
say,
judge,
it's
not
in
the
interests
of
justice
to
permit
this
amendment.
my
client
hasn't
been
here,
et
cetera,
there
are
other
ways
to
get
him.
and
that's
why
this
case
seems
about
rule
15
at
the
bottom
to
me,
but
unfortunately
for
you,
i
guess,
if
i'm
right,
then
you
didn't
make
that
argument,
so
why
am
i
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
but
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
just
go
back
to
this
question.
what
else
would
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
he
was
trying
to
get
at
by
that
second
point,
right
at
that
moment,
april
8,
1998.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
on
page
3
of
your
brief,
the
bottom
of
the
page.
you
are
describing
the
substance
of
the
motion
to
amend,
which
was
the
first
pleading,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
filed
after
the
court
had
joined
or
purported
to
join
him
as
a
party,
and
he
says
two
things
in
his
motion
to
amend
the
judgment.
number
1,
he
says,
285
doesn't,
in
fact,
entitle
them
to
fees.
number
2,
he
says,
beside...
even
aside
from
that,
and
i'm
quoting
your
brief,
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation.
don't
you
think
the
reasonable
way
to
read
that
second
point
is,
he
is
claiming...
he
is
contesting
jurisdiction
over
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
else
was
he
doing?
tell
me
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
said
that
in
the
first
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
we're
at
the
second
part.
he's
saying,
i'm
not
liable
because
i
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
he
contesting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
him
pay
the
fee
award?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
always,
i
guess,
do
you?
i
mean,
there
can
be
weird
situations
where
they
just
made
a
mistake
in
the
name,
or
say
they
were
siamese
twins
and
the
other
one
wasn't
named
properly
but
he's
been
in
the
courtroom
the
whole
time.
i
mean,
there
are
odd
situations
where
i
guess
you
can,
but
it
isn't
normal,
right?
i
mean,
it's
not
normal
that
you
would...
what
happened
here
would
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
said
a
second
ago...
i
just
want
to
ask
you
this
technical
point.
i
think
you
said
a
second
ago
that
in
the
cert
petition
he
has
withdrawn
the
objection
to
the
timing,
and
you
referred
to
a
page,
but
i
didn't
get
it.
what
page
is
that
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
7,
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
you're
wrong,
i
guess
your
narrowest
argument
is,
even
if
you're
wrong,
the
way
to
do
it
is
rule
15,
and
say
it's
not
in
the
interests
of
justice,
rather
than
start
redefining
prevailing
party
under
the...
am
i
right,
or
not,
that
if
you're
wrong
on
that,
the
way
to
attack
you
is
through
rule
15?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
