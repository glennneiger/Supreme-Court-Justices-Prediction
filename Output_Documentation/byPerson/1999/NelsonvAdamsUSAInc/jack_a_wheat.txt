mr.
jack
a.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
at
least
three
major
waivers
in
this
case.
one,
jurisdiction
was
waived.
the
motion
to
vacate
was
not
a
special
appearance.
paragraph
1
of
the
motion
to
vacate--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
there's
a
docket
item
number
133--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--to
address
your
question,
your
honor,
in
section
1
of
the
motion
to
vacate,
they
acknowledged
he
was
a
party
and
requested
that
the
order
be
amended
to
delete
him
as
a
party.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
your
honor,
i
understand
your
point.
i
don't
agree
with
it.
jurisdiction
was
not
challenged.
on
appeal,
jurisdiction
was
not
challenged.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
the
way
this
case
progressed,
your
honor,
was
that
eventually
led
into
the
argument
made
on
appeal
by
analogy
to
the
civil
rights
cases
that
a
fee
award
was
not--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--and
which
section
are
you
referring
to,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
your
honor,
i'm--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--he
was
saying,
i'm
not
liable
for
this
fee
award--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--under
285.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
was
not
a
party
when
the
judgment
was
originally
entered,
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
way
i
understood
that
argument.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
i
do
not
read
that
as
a
challenge
to
the
jurisdiction.
on
appeal,
jurisdiction
was
not
challenged.
a
rule
15
argument
was
made
on
appeal.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
justice
ginsburg,
as
i
read
the
rule
15
argument
it
was
about
the
timing,
not
the
question
of
whether
he
was
made
a
party...
questioning
the
timing,
was
it
too
late
in
the
proceeding
to
make
him
a
party,
and
that
question's
been
waived
in
this
court.
page--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--your
honor,
it
was
a
peculiar
procedure.
we've
looked
to
the
peculiarities
and
particularities
of
this
case.
we
were
looking
at
the
fact
that
it
appeared
mr.
nelson
was
collaterally
estopped
by
the
finding
against
ohio
cellular
products.
he
didn't
question
jurisdiction.
he
questioned
the
timing
of
the
amendment.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
your
honor,
i
understood
it
to
be
two
objections.
the
285
objection
was
because
we
had
not
prevailed
against
him,
the
analogy
to
the
civil
rights
cases,
and
objecting
to
the
timing
of
the
amendment,
a
rule
15
objection
which
has
been
waived,
page
7
of
the
petition
for
cert.
they
say
they
no
longer
question
the
timing
of
that
amendment.
they
agree
the
timing
was
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
i
understand
their
argument,
your
honor--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--and
disagree
with
it.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
they're
arguing
that
he
was
not
a
nonprevailing
party,
is
my
understanding.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
are
we
saying
the
same
thing?
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
yes,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
points
there.
of
course,
due
process
is
a
waivable
defense.
we
think
he
did
have
due
process
here.
he
was--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--in
the
collateral
estoppel
context,
i
believe
because
of
the
collateral
estoppel
situation
i
believe
mr.
nelson
had
his
due
process.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
your
honor,
the
order
we
tendered
with
the
motion
to
amend,
the
order
said
the
third
party
complaint
is
deemed
amended
to
add
mr.
nelson
as
a
party.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
there
was
no
change--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--your
honor,
service
of
process
is
fundamental.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
this
was
not
a
normal
case,
i
agree,
your
honor.
perhaps
a
complaint
would
have
been
the
approach,
rather
than
a
motion.
the
case
law
we've
cited
in
our
brief
says
that
if
that
happens,
if
you
proceed
by
motion
instead
of
by
complaint,
but
if
the
response
to
the
motion
is
not
an
objection
that
you
should
have
filed--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--your
honor,
there
were
about
three
cases
we
cited
in
our
brief
on
pages
30
and
31,
where
the
courts
uniformly
held
in
those
cases
that
it
was
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
be
served
if
in
your
response
to
those
motions
you
did
not
object
to
not
being
served
with
the
complaint.
here,
he
did
not
object
to
not
being
served
with
the
complaint
until
we
got
to
this
court.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
he
referring
to--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--he
was
not
a
named
party,
but
he
was
actively
involved
in
the
litigation,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
he
was
not
a
named
party,
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
he
was
not
party,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
against
mr.
nelson?
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
i
believe
ohio
has...
you
have
to
wait
10
days
to
allow--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--your
honor,
i'll
be
candid
with
the
court
and
say,
frankly
we
were
scratching
our
heads
saying,
what
do
we
do
next,
and
less
than
a
week
later,
after
we
received
the
order,
in
came
the
entry
of
appearance.
we
said,
okay,
he's
here
now.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
we
felt
that
we
needed
to
serve
him
with
something,
and
we
weren't
sure
what.
the
order
saying
the
complaint's
deemed...
the
third
party
complaint's
deemed
amended
to
add
him
as
a
third
party,
serve
him
with
a
copy
of
the
third
party
complaint--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--frankly,
your
honor,
my
practice,
whether
it's
good
practice
or
not,
is,
i
don't
sue
every
potential
party.
i
tend
to
go
after--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--it's
not,
your
honor.
this
was
not
a
normal
case.
you
know,
in
the
patent
infringement--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--yes,
your
honor,
fromson
is
factually
distinguishable
based
upon
that
distinction
you
just
made,
but
the
law
in
fromson
is
the
timing
of
an
amendment
post
judgment,
and
the
federal
circuit
held
that
was
appropriate,
that
you
can
amend
post
judgment
to
add
a
new
party.
that's
what
we
did.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
yes,
a
consideration
and
whether
to
allow
an
amendment,
whether
it's
unjust.
that
was
an
equitable
consideration.
i
agree.
i
think
the
more
pertinent
case,
your
honor,
is
american
surety,
where
justice
brandeis
writing
for
the
quote...
for
the
court
was
that
it
was
a
situation
where
a
judgment
was
entered
against
the
surety
company
without
notice,
the
court,
justice
brandeis
speaking
for
the
court
said,
we're
assuming
due
process
was
denied,
but
when
you
filed
your
motion
to
vacate
you
did
not
raise
that
issue.
when
you
appealed,
you
did
not
raise
that
issue.
it
was
not
waived...
it
was
not
raised
until
your
motion
for
rehearing
at
the
appellate
court.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
and--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
said
no,
it
probably
wasn't
a
bond
posted
for
both
parties,
but
it
was
too
late
to
raise
that
issue
because
you
didn't
raise
it
until
your
motion--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--you
do,
but
it
may
be
post
judgment,
as
long
as
you
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
mr.
nelson
had
his
opportunity.
the
order
was
amended.
he
said--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
under
american
surety
your
opportunity
to
be
heard
post
judgment
is
adequate
as
long
as
you
do
have
that
opportunity.
the
order,
the
judgment
was
amended.
mr.
nelson
said,
here
i
am,
let's
resolve
it
in
this
court.
the
judge
said,
okay,
make
your
argument.
he
made
his
argument.
he
didn't
challenge
jurisdiction.
he
didn't
challenge
the
finding
that
he
had--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--he
said
i'm
here
and
shouldn't
be
here,
and
then
on
appeal
he
challenged
the
timing
of
the
amendment--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--not
whether
he
had
not
been
served.
that
wasn't
an
issue
at
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
page
7.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
the
petitioner
does
not
here
challenge
the
liberal
pleading
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
does
not
challenge
the
district
court's
decision
to
grant
respondents
leave
to
1)
amend
their
complaint,
2)
join
petitioner
as
a
new
party
defendant,
and
3)
to
do
so
after
judgment
had
been
rendered.
the
timing
was
the
issue
in
the
federal
circuit,
along
with
does
285
even
apply.
the
timing
issue
is
waived.
does
285
apply?
i
think
if
you
analogize
to
the
civil
rights
cases,
it's
a
specious
analogy.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
no,
i
think
285
was
argued
at
the
federal
circuit,
and
was
argued--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--yes.
in
our
response
to
the
petition
for
cert,
our
position
was
that's
the
only
issue
that
would
really
be
ripe
for
consideration
by
this
court,
that
all
the
other
issues
have
been
waived,
and
again,
we
think
it's
a
specious
analogy
to
analogize
the
285
fee
award
to
a
civil
rights
fee
award
because
they
are
awarded
for
totally
different
purposes.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
well,
the
way
we
understood
it
was,
he
should
have
been
a
party
when
we
obtained
the
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
he
was
not
a
party
at
that
point.
collaterally
estopped,
perhaps,
but
not
a
named
party
at
that
point.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
your
honor,
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
what
i
have
is
the
petition
for
cert,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
there
have
actually
been
two,
and
we
need
to
clarify
this
quickly.
there
was
the
motion
to
alter
and
amend
the
judgment
entry,
docket
item
number
133.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
yes,
133.
ms.
dixon
this
morning
did
mention
the
rule
60(b)
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment.
that
motion
is
totally
collateral
to
the
record
you
have.
that
motion
was
filed
after
the
federal
circuit
affirmed
the
judgment.
the
trial
court
has
held
that
jurisdiction
was
waived.
that
decision
is
reprinted,
full
text,
in
our
response
to
the
petition
for
cert.--
that
issue
is
at
the
federal
circuit
right
now,
whether
the
trial
court
had
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
they're
going
to
have
it
one
way
or
the
other.
did
they
raise
it
in
the
matter
that's
before
this
court,
or
did
they
not
raise
it?
there,
they
say
it
wasn't
raised
yet.
it
needs
to
be
addressed.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
it's...
after
the
federal
circuit
affirmed
this
judgment,
they
filed
a
rule
60(b)
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment,
filed
that
with
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
overruled
that
motion.
the
opinion
is
reprinted
full
text
in
our
response
to
the
petition
for
cert.
that
order
is
now
on
appeal
at
the
federal
circuit
and
is
fully
briefed.
it
is
not
in
the
record
on
appeal
here
that
you
have,
the
record
you--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--i
haven't
received
an
order
to
that
effect,
but
i
suspect
that
it
has,
but
that's
just
a
guess
on
my
part.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
you
mean,
based
upon
the
judgment
we
have
against
him--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--i'm
not
involved
in
collection
law,
but
i
do
generally
understand
that
to
be
the
case,
that
if
there
is
a
liquidation
you
can
follow
the
assets
to
the
shareholder.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
assets.
we've
tried
various
executions
and
they've
all
come
back
with
there
being
no
property
found
against
the
corporation.
we
were
told
it
was
going
to
be
shut
down
if
we
obtained
a
judgment
against
it,
and
that's
what
motivated
us
to
then
proceed
against
mr.
nelson
individually,
being
our
view
he
was
collaterally
estopped
to
challenge
the
finding
that
the
fee
award
was
based
upon
his
inequitable
conduct,
and
that
finding
wasn't
challenged
at
either
the
trial
court
or
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
justice...
excuse
me.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
justice
ginsburg,
we're
asking
for
something
much
more
narrow
than
that:
when
you
have
a
situation
where
it's
a
controlling
shareholder,
in
this
case
the
sole
shareholder,
the
controlling
officer,
the
person
actively
involved
in
the
litigation,
the
person
controlling
the
litigation
and
therefore
collaterally
estopped
by
the
finding
against
the
corporation,
and
if
it
is
that
person
who
committed
the
fraud
which
warranted
the
fee
award,
that
you
should
be
allowed
to
recover
that
fee
award.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record.
pre
judgment,
he
challenged
whether
he
committed
inequitable
conduct.
the
trial
court
found
that
he
did.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
no.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
they
found
that
it
was
his
inequitable
conduct
that
was
imputed
to
the
corporation,
and
that
that
inequitable
conduct
that
he
personally
committed
was
what
support--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--your--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--that
argument
did
not
come
up
until
we
were
in
this
court.
it
would
have
been
logical
in
his
first
appearance
to
say,
hey,
i'm
not
served,
you
don't
have
jurisdiction,
i'm
not
in
privity
with
ohio
cellular
products.
none
of
those
arguments
were
made.
he
said,
here
i
am.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
pay
the
fee
award.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
he
said
he
did
not...
should
not
be
a
party,
and
wanted
that
order
reversed
or
vacated
that
made
him
a
party.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
i
think
the
best
case
on
that
point
is
the
hughes,
h
u
g
h
e
s,
case
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
yes.
it
was
the
patentee
who
no
longer
owned
the
patent.
it
was
assigned
to
his
corporation,
but
he
was
the
one
who
committed
the
inequitable
conduct,
and
the
federal
circuit
held
that
he
was
liable
for
a
fee
award.
in
fact,
i'm
aware
of
no
cases
saying
you
cannot
hold
the
patentee--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--oh,
i
think
there
are
two
ways
we
could
have
pursued
it,
rule
15,
which
we
did--
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
--or
we
could
have
filed
an
independent
action
in
both
claiming
he
was
collaterally
estopped,
but
yes,
that
does
then
get
to
the
issue,
is
he
liable
for
the
fee
award.
the
jurisprudence
interpreting
285
is
clear
that
the
one
who
commits
inequitable
conduct
can
be
held
liable.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
yes,
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
wheat
no.
we
did
not
proceed
under
that
theory.
we
proceeded
under
the
theory
that
the
person
who
committed
the
inequitable
conduct
is...
can
be
held
accountable
for
the
fee
award,
and
under
the
theory
that
he
was
collaterally
estopped
to
dispute
the
finding
that
he
committed
inequitable
conduct
adequate
to
support
the
fee
award.
unless
there
are
other
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
remarks.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention
to
this
matter.
