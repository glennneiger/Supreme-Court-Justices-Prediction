justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
seem
to
rely
on
15(c)(3),
which
i
thought
gave
maybe
too
easy
an
answer
in
your
favor,
because
one
of
the...
in
addressing
the
question
of
adding
a
party
by
amendment,
15(c)(3)(a)
sets
as
a
condition
that
the
party
to
be
added
gets
sufficient
notice
so
that
he
will
not
be
prejudiced
in
putting
in
a
defense,
which
seems
to
imply
very
clearly
that
it
can't
be
done
when
the
case
is
closed
and
no
defense
can
be
put
in.
is...
that's...
maybe
that's
too
easy.
is
there
a
reason
you
don't
rely
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
just
want
to
get
to
the
narrow
waiver
point
that
was
raised,
and
my
recollection
is
the
same
as
justice
scalia's,
and
that
is...
i
don't
remember
procedurally
how
to
describe
this,
but
my
recollection
from
reading
the
briefs
was
that
at
the
first
moment
that
he
filed
any
pleading
following
the
joinder,
one
of
the
things
he
said
is,
you
can't
do
this
because
i
am
not
a
party,
or
was
not
a
party.
is
that
recollection
correct,
that
he
raised
his
nonparty
status
at
that
moment?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
if
you
win
on
that...
if
you
win
on
that,
you
won,
i
guess.
i
think.
if
you
win
on
that,
that
it
was
a
special
appearance,
and
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
there,
and
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
they
never
served
him,
i
guess...
you'd
at
least
have
to
find
out
about
that.
suppose
you
lost
on
that.
suppose,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument.
for
the
sake
of
argument,
suppose
it
turns
out
to
be
a
waiver
of
the
jurisdiction.
is
there
any
other
ground
you
could
win
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
saying
that.
you
said...
i
assume
when
you
said
opportunity
to
be
heard,
i
thought
you
meant
opportunity
to
put
in
a
defense,
which
he
can't
do
after
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it...
why
don't
you...
and
i
may
be
missing
something
here,
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
simpler
for
your
position
to
say,
no,
they
can't
get
him
into
this
action
after
judgment.
what
they
can
do
is
try
to
collect
the
attorney's
fees
from
him
by
pursuing
him
in
a
separate
action
and
claiming
that
there
is,
in
fact,
preclusion.
he
can
then
defend
on
whether
or
not
there
is
preclusion
in
the
assertion
of
the
fee
claim
against
him,
and
he
will
do
so
based
on
whether
he
was
given
an
equitable
opportunity
to
be
heard
if
he
had
wanted
to
in
the
first
action,
and
so
on.
why
isn't
that
the
more
orderly
way
to
structure
the
possibilities
for
what
they
want
to
do
and
you
want
to
defend?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
wheat,
at
least
on
page
3
of...
yes,
page
3
of
your
brief
you
say
that
on
april
8
nelson,
appearing
individually,
brought
a
motion
to
amend,
and
this
was,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
sequence
you
set
out,
the
first
pleading
that
nelson
filed
after
being
joined
as
a
party,
and
you
say...
again,
i'm
still
on
page
3
of
your
brief...
that
he
raised
two
claims.
number
1,
he
said
that
section
285
doesn't
allow
an
award
of
fees
in
these
circumstances
and
number
2,
he
couldn't
be
held
under
285
anyway,
because
he
was
not
a
party.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
may
not
have
been
the
most
subtle
way,
that
latter
claim
that
he
was
not
a
party
may
not
have
been
the
most
complete
or
subtle
way
to
raise
the
point,
but
it
sounds
as
though
someone
is
trying
to
raise
the
point
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
here,
and
so
i
have
my...
i
have
difficulty
in
just
taking
it
as
a
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
assume
what
they
meant
was,
he's
a
party
because
you've
just
issued
an
order
saying
he
is
one,
but...
and
taking
the
pleading
as
you've
described
it
in
your
own
brief,
his
next
statement
was,
i
am
not
a
party,
or
was
not
a
party
through
the
litigation,
and
that
makes...
i
guess
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me
except
on
the
theory
that
he's
saying,
you
have
no
jurisdiction
over
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
not
challenged
using
the
word,
jurisdiction,
but
what
else
was
he
getting
at
in
the
second
part
of
his
motion
to
amend
the
judgment?
i
mean,
if
i
could
find
a
commonsensical
reading
that
doesn't
involve
a
jurisdictional
challenge,
i
might
accept
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're...
he's--
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
taking
it
as,
he's
not
making
the
argument,
i
have
never
been
to
the
united
states
of
america,
i
never
got
any
notice
and
i
don't
know
what
this
is
about,
and
you
have
no
jurisdiction.
he's
making
the
argument,
i've
been
here
the
whole
time,
i
know
everything
that's
going
on,
i
have
total
notice,
and
i'm
in
here
telling
you
that
you
can
only
award
attorney's
fees
under
this
statute
against
a
real
party,
not
somebody
who's
just
been
made
a
party
for
purposes
of
the
attorney
fees.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
i
guess
it
would
be
helpful
to
find
out
which
argument
he's
making
if
we
actually
had
the
document
in
which
he
made
it,
and
i
gather
we
don't.
where
is
it?
you
have
it
up
there,
but
we
don't
have
it,
i
think.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
all
right.
well,
where
is
the
document
in
which
he
went
to
the
district
court
and
made
whatever
argument
it
was
he
made?
is
that
with
the
clerk's
office
or
somewhere?
