justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
did
move
to
amend
the
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
take
it
that's
tantamount
to
a
special
appearance,
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--now,
just
a
minute
here.
you're
saying
that
rule
15
was
an
objection,
that
even
though
it
appears
he
might
have
had
a
meritorious
ground
to
say
it
doesn't
relate
back
under
15(c),
that
he
doesn't
have
to
do
that
because
he's
not
there.
he's
not
a
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
i
said,
well,
but
you
did
move
to
amend
the
judgment,
and
you
said,
well,
that
was
just
a
delaying
tactic.
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
you're
being
consistent
in
your
position
of
saying
that
he's
not
a
party
before
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand,
but
you...
and
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
when
he
does
come
to
court
and
move
to
amend
the
judgment,
this
is
tantamount
to
a
special
appearance
challenging
the
court's
authority
to
treat
him
as
a
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
it's
tantamount
to
a
special
appearance
to
challenge
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
where
we
were
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
argument,
because
i
just
want
to
anticipate
what
i
think
respondents
are
going
to
tell
me,
when
you
went
into
the
district
court,
when
mr.
nelson
made
his
first
appearance,
page
4
of
the
red
brief
tells
us
that
nelson,
in
full
italics,
nelson
did
not
raise
issues
of
due
process,
personal
jurisdiction,
or
service
of
process.
all
you
made
was
the
motion
under
the
substantive
provision
of
the
patent
law,
and
if
i
were
asked
i
would
say
that
is
a
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
i
find
it's
a
waiver,
then
i'd
say
that
it's
fair
to
say,
why
didn't
you
move
to...
so
long
as
you
made
what
i
think
is
an
appearance,
a
general
appearance,
why
didn't
you
move
under
rule
15(c)
to
say
this
doesn't
relate
back,
there's
no
mistaken
identity
of
the
parties?
i
mean,
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
the
clear
vice
in
what
the
court
did
here
under
the
rules,
if...
forgetting
about
the
serious
due
process
one.
but
you
say
this
is
so
fundamental
that
we
should
raise
it
here
for
the
first
time
under
rule
10.
you
didn't
even
raise
it
in
the
trial
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
can
we
find
that
motion?
i
see
the
reference
to
the
docket
entry
in
the
joint
appendix.
is
the
motion
itself
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
are
you
reading--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think--
[laughter]
i
think
you
agree
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.--
