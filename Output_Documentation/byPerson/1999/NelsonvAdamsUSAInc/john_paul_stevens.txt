i
ask
you
a
preliminary--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
preliminary
question?
he
first
reared
his
ugly
head
after
march
25,
1998,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nelson.
he
first...
he
was
not
a
party
prior
to
march
25,
1998,
was
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
was
he
a
party
to
the
litigation
before
1998?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
not
a
party,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
on
march
27,
1998,
nothing
had
been
done
by
either
side,
could
the
marshall
have
levied
on
that
judgment,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wait
the
10
days,
then.
wait
15
days.
do
you
think
it
was
a
valid
judgment
that
would
be
enforceable
by
seizing
his
assets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
without
that
appearance
you
would
agree,
i
think,
that
there
was
no
power...
there
was
a
void
judgment
as
to
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
a
question
about
the
merits?
are
there
cases
out
there
in
which
a
corporation
brought
a
patent
suit
and
lost
because
its
sales
manager
or
patent
office
manager
engaged
in
serious
inequitable
conduct
in
the
patent
office
and
that
voided
the
patent,
in
which,
after
the
litigation
was
all
over,
they
got
a
judgment
against
the
officer
who
committed
the
wrongdoing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
got
attorney's
fees
from
the
officer?
