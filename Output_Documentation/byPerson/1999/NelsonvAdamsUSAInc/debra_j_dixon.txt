ms.
debra
j.
dixon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
where
the
respondent,
adams
usa,
obtained
a
judgment
of
invalidity,
had
that
judgment
affirmed
on
appeal,
obtained
a
judicial
determination
of
inequitable
conduct
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees,
had
that
award
reaffirmed,
had
all
american
sports
corporation
dismissed
from
the
judgment,
obtained
a
judicial
determination
as
to
the
amount
of
fees
to
be
paid,
had
that
fee
award
reduced
to
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$178,000.
then,
and
only
then,
did
the
respondent
attempt
to
have
don
nelson
joined
as
a
party.
the
rules
of
substantive
law,
the
rules
of
constitutional
law,
and
the
rules
of
procedural
law
all
tell
us
that
adams
did
this
wrong.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
do
challenge
that,
your
honor.
what
i
understand
the
record
to
say
is
that
the
respondents
were
granted
leave
to
amend
their
complaint
to
join
don
nelson
as
a
party.
however,
as
we
sit
here
today--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--there
was
an
object...
there
was
a
motion
filed
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment,
but
there
was
no
formal
objection.
mr.
nelson
had
not
been
served
with
process
and
had
not
filed
a
responsive
pleading
at
that
time.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
the
waiver
rule
specifically
states
that
one
must
assert
a
defense
at
their
first
opportunity.
under
federal
civil
rule
12,
that
first
opportunity
is
in
one's
responsive
pleading.
a
potential
party
has
absolutely
no
obligation
to
file
a
responsive
pleading
until
he
or
she
has
been
served
with
process.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
precisely,
justice
scalia.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your...
if
i
may
address
justice
scalia's
point
first,
that's
precisely
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
he
was
not
there.
because
he
wasn't
there,
there
was
nothing
for
mr.
nelson
to
waive.
as
it
relates
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
i
believe
this
court
has
spoken
on
multiple
occasions
stating
that,
until
one
has
been
served
with
service
of
process
and
had
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
they
are
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
being
as
though
mr.
nelson
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
he
was
not
able
to
waive
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
quite
frankly,
based
on
my
reading
of
the
record,
it
appears
as
though
the
motion
to
amend
or
alter
the
judgment
was
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
buy
time
on
appeal.
post
judgment,
there
are
only
two--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
would
disagree
with
the
court.
my
position
is
that
post
judgment
there
are
only
two
remedies
available
to
someone
in
the
position
of
mr.
nelson.
one
is
filing
an
appeal,
the
second
is
filing
a
60(b),
both
of
which
have
been
done
by
mr.
nelson
as
he
sits
before
this
court.
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
underlying
action
at
the
time
that
motion
was
pending
before
the
court
and,
as
a
result,
was
not
in
a
position
to
file
a
responsive
pleading.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
his
60(b)
motion
related,
your
honor,
to
the
due
process
violation
as
well
as
the
violations
of
the
federal
civil
rules.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
procedurally
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
based
on
the
statute
under
which
adams
is
seeking
awards
and
the
extension
of
the
judgment
of
attorney's
fees
against
mr.
nelson,
they
have
not
even
met
their
threshold
requirement
of
prevailing
party.
based
on
that,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
15(c)
and,
in
fact,
the
due
process
requirements
have
been
met
in
effect
become
a
secondary
issue.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
would
represent
to
the
court
that
mr.
nelson
sits
in
this
courtroom
today,
more
than
2
years
after
the
district
court
granted
leave
to
amend
the
complaint,
ready,
willing,
and
able,
if
this
court's
judgment
so
orders,
to
accept
service
of
process,
appear
in
the
district
court,
and
litigate
this
matter
on
its
merits.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
certainly,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
by
virtue
of
filing...
the
very
fact
that
mr.
nelson
filed
a
motion
to
amend
and/or
alter
the
pleadings,
which,
as
i
understand
the
court,
the
court
is
directing
my
attention
to--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--your
honor,
my
response
to
that
question
is
two
pronged.
first
and
foremost,
mr.
nelson's
position
continues
to
be
the
court
has
not...
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
him
in
this
matter
because
the
respondents
have
not
filed
the
procedural
requirements
for
jurisdiction
to
attach.
as
i
understand--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--by
consent
it
can
be
waived,
certainly,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
there
are
certain
pleadings
that
may
waive
those
jurisdictional
requirements.
however,
i
would
likewise
represent
to
this
court
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
merely
by
filing
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment
pursuant
to
civil
rule
59
does
not
constitute
such
a
waiver.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
it
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
however,
the
distinction
is
made
as
to
the
timing
that
this...
the
issue
was
raised.
as
the
court
is
aware,
mr.
nelson
did
not
file
the
motion
to
amend
or
alter
the
judgment
until
judgment
on
the
merits
had
been
rendered.
he
was
simply
brought
into
this
case
as
a...
attempted
to
be
brought
into
this
case
as
a
last
ditch
effort
by
adams
to
have
somebody
pony
up
the
$178,000
in
fees.
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
mr.
nelson
was
never
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
this
court
when
it
was
heard
on
its
merits,
he
cannot,
based
on
this
court's
prior
rulings,
be
subject
to
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
post
judgment.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
based
on
civil
rules,
as
well
as
this
court's
prior
holdings,
that's
simply
not
the
case.
more
importantly,
a
careful
review
of
the
docket
from
the
district
court
undercuts
any
such
argument.
on
march
25
of
1998,
at
10:09
a.m.,
the
district
court's
docket
was
silent
as
to
donald
nelson
in
his
individual
capacity.
one
minute
later,
at
10:10
a.m.,
the
docket
reflected
not
only
had
mr.
nelson
been
joined
as
a
party,
but
was
subject
to
and
bound
by
a
judgment
in
excess
of
178,000--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
he
certainly
did
raise
the
issue
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
as
part
of
his
motion
to
alter
and
amend,
but
in
no
way
did
he
subject
himself
to
that
jurisdiction.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
would
disagree
with
the
court.
i
do
not
believe--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--i
understand
the
distinction
technically.
i
just
wanted
to
differentiate.
in
the
zenith
case
counsel
for
hazeltine,
when
they
came
in,
they
specifically
acknowledged
to
the
court
they
were
making
a,
quote,
special
appearance,
end
quote.
there
was
no
such
appearance
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
nelson
in
conjunction
with
his
motion
to
amend
or
alter--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--absolutely.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
would
definitely
go
with
the
special
appearance,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
absolutely,
your
honor.
under
section
285,
the
statute
that
provides
for
awards
of
attorney's
fees
in
patent
cases
involving
exceptional
circumstances,
that
statute
has,
as
is
outlined...
as
is
also
found
in
the
civil
rights
arena,
a
threshold
requirement
of
being
a,
quote,
prevailing
party,
end
quote.
this
court,
although
it
has
not
specifically
addressed
the
definition
of
prevailing
party,
subject
to
section
285,
has
on
a
multitude
of
occasions
wrestled
with
and,
in
fact,
addressed
the
definition
of
prevailing
party
within
the
civil
rights
arena,
specifically
under
42
u.s.c.
1988.
in
each
of
those
cases,
this
court
has
found
in
order
to
be
a
prevailing
party
one
must
have
prevailed
against
the
opposing
side
on
the
merits.
the
record
before
this
court
is
clear.
when
this
matter
was
adjudicated
on
its
merits,
donald
nelson
was
not
a
party.
by
virtue
of
the
fact
he
was
not
a
party
on
the
merits,
under
section
285,
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
be
subject
to
an
award
of
fees
post
judgment--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--your
honor--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
you
on
a
more
global
scale.
however,
as
it
relates
to
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
court,
as
the
record
reflects,
at
the
time
the
underlying
litigation
was
instituted,
mr.
nelson
had
released
all
right,
title,
and
interest
he
had
in
the
subject
patents,
the
110
and
the
702
patent.
he
had
absolutely
no
relationship
to
either
of
those
patents
when
the
underlying
litigation
commenced.
by
virtue
of
that
lack
of
a
relationship
to
either
of
those
patents,
there
were
no
merits
against
mr.
nelson
to
which
adams
could
prevail
upon.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
certainly
rule
21
applies,
again
in
the
more
global
sense,
but
it
does
not
absolve
the
party
attempting
to
amend
to
their
rule
4
requirement
of
service
of
process.
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
one,
in
order
to
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
must
be
served
with
process
and
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
well,
certainly
that's
a
collateral
point,
justice
ginsburg.
however--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
where,
post
judgment,
mr.
nelson
could
be
served
with
process
and
joined
as
a
party.
however,
that
mandates
that
he
be
permitted
to
be
heard
on
the
merits,
specifically
the
merits
which
led
to
the
award
of
attorney's
fees,
but
that
does
not--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--justice
souter,
i
would
wholeheartedly
agree
with
you.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
mr.
nelson
sits
here
today
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
answer
claims
that
are
made--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i
think
those...
both
of
those
options
are
available
to
adams.
what
the
fundamental
principle
involved
in
both--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--i
can't
fathom
circumstances
under
which
they'd
want
to.
however,
all
we're
requesting
is
that
they
finish
the
lawsuit
they
started
with
mr.--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--but
adams
certainly
did
assert
counterclaims,
which
they
vigorously
prosecuted.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
on
appeal
has,
whether
or
not
he
raised
the
rule
15
argument
directly,
certainly
raised
that
by
virtue
of
his
more
far
reaching
violation
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
argument.
the
fundamental
principle
involved
in
this
case
is
a
complete
failure
of
service
of
process,
and
notwithstanding
that
complete
failure
of
service
of
process,
an
attempt
to
bind
a
stranger
to
the
litigation
post
judgment,
and
that
finding
by
both
the
district
court
as
well
as
the
federal
circuit
court
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
prior
rulings.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
correct.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
certainly
the
filing
of
the
complaint
is
the
predicate
act
to
permit
mr.
nelson
to
file
a
responsive
pleading,
hence
subjecting
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
of
the
district
court.
the
fundamental
problem
in
this
case
is
that,
without
that
opportunity
to
be
heard,
mr.
nelson
was
nonetheless
subject
to
a
judgment
where
he
had
no
opportunity
to
litigate
the
underlying
merits.
justice
newman,
in
her
dissent
in
the
federal
circuit
court,
stated
it
very
accurately,
that
both
the
respondents
and
the
majority
for
the
federal
circuit
hold
hard
and
fast
to
this
concept
of
this
case
presenting
a,
quote,
particular
circumstance,
end
quote,
and
by
virtue
of
that
particular
circumstance,
a
violation
of
both
the
letter
and
spirit
of
not
only
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
but
also
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
have
been
violated.
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
circumstances
should
not
circumvent
the
rules.
they
should
be
strictly
adhered
to
and
be
uniformly
applied
to
both--
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
--your
honor,
i
did
not
find
it
in
the
brief.
however,
if
i
could
direct
the
court's
attention
to
justice...
judge
newman's
dissenting
opinion,
it
was
discussed
at
length,
and
one
must
presume
that
it
was
dealt
with
before
that
court.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
assuming,
without
conceding,
that
the
due
process
clause
was
not
raised
before
the
federal
circuit
court,
the
due
process
considerations
in
this
case
are
so
fundamental
to
the
issue
that
this
court
has
the
authority
to
exercise
their
supervisory
responsibilities
and
deal
with
that
issue
in
the
nelson
v.
adams
matter.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
i
would
say
that
that's
rules
of
the
supreme
court
10.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
not
off
hand
i
don't,
your
honor.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
again,
i
would
disagree
with
the
court
that
that's
a
waiver.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
opportunity
was
not
provided
specifically
to
mr.
nelson
because
that
appearance
was
made
post
judgment.
the
two
remedies
that
were
available
to
him
were
a
direct
appeal
and
a
60(b)
motion,
both
of
which
he
availed
himself
to.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
a
few
points
i
wish
to
attempt
to
clarify
for
the
court.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor,
because
even
conceding
the
district
court's
ability
to
perfect
all
three
of
those
items,
it
does
not
obviate
mr.
nelson's
right
to
service
of
process
and
the
right
to
be
heard.
what
the
petitioner
does
challenge
in
the
district
court,
and
object
to
in
the
district
court's
finding,
was
having
rendered
a
judgment
against
him
without
affording
him
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
or
defend
on
the
merits,
and
there
were
multiple
defenses
available
to
mr.
nelson,
as
well
as
a
potential
counterclaim,
which
were
not
available
to
ohio
cellular
products,
which
in
turn
were
not
raised
at
the
trial
court.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
your
honor,
i
respond
to
that
quite
directly.
under
civil
rule
12,
a
responsive
pleading
is
a
party's
first
opportunity
to
be
heard.
however,
the
responsive
pleading
is
deemed
to
either
be
a
dispositive
motion
prior
to
filing
an
answer,
or
an
answer.
the
predicate
to
that
is
adams'
filing
of
a
complaint
and
giving
mr.
nelson
the
opportunity
to
affirmatively
respond
to
the
same.
ms.
debra
j.
dixon
correct,
your
honor,
because,
as
we
had
addressed
during
my
initial
argument,
mr.
nelson's
filing
the
rule
59
motion
