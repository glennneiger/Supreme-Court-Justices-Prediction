justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
involves
a
tort
plaintiff
who
was
hurt
while
she
was
driving
a
1987
honda
accord
equipped
with
seat
belts
which
she
had
buckled
up
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
she
bases
her
claim
on
the
theory
that
the
car
should
have
been
equipped
with
airbags
as
well;
and
the
legal
question
is
whether
federal
law,
in
particular
a
1984
national
highway
transportation
safety
act
standard
called
the
“passive
restraint”
standard,
whether
that
forbids
in
effect
the
bringing
of
this
kind
of
state
court
tort
suit.
in
other
words,
does
federal
law
preempt
the
suit?
the
district
court
found
that
it
did
preempt
the
suit;
so
the
plaintiff
couldn’t
bring
it.
and
like
other
federal
courts
that
have
considered
similar
matters,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
agreed.
but
some
state
courts
have
taken
a
different
view,
and
so
we
agreed
to
hear
the
case
to
resolve
the
differences.
now,
it
is
a
complicated
case
and
we
answer
three
separate
questions:
first,
there
is
an
express
preemption
provision
in
the
national
highway
transportation
safety
act.
does
that
express
preemption
provision,
preempt
this
lawsuit?
and
we
read
that
preemption
provision
in
light
of
another
provision
which
saves
certain
tort
suits;
and
read
that
way,
we
say
the
answer
is,
“no,
it
does
not
expressly
preempt
a
suit.”
then
the
second
question
is,
well,
what
about
that
savings
clause?
does
that
savings
clause
really
require
the
opposite?
does
it
preserve
in
some
way
or
other,
state
tort
suits
like
this
one?
again,
we
say
the
answer
is
‘no.’
what
we
think
applies,
are
just
ordinary
preemption
principles.
alright
third;
using
those
ordinary
preemption
principles
--
those
principles
by
the
way
require,
or
say,
state
that
a
federal
regulation
will
preempt
a
state
common
law
tort
action
--
either
you
can’t
bring
it
--
if
that
tort
action
actually
conflicts
with
the
regulation.
so
we
have
to
decide
using
that
principle
is
there
an
actual
conflict
here?
now,
after
going
into
the
history
of
the
regulation
in
some
detail,
we
conclude
that
there
is
an
actual
conflict.
the
regulation
in
our
view
was
designed
to
promote
safety
by
producing
a
mix
of
different
passive
restraint
devices,
not
just
airbags;
and
moreover,
that
mix
was
to
be
introduced
gradually
over
time,
and
the
agency
had
safety
related
and
administrative
reasons
for
doing
that.
and
we
think
that
petitioner’s
tort
suit,
which
in
effect,
would
insist
upon
immediate
introduction
and
uniform
introduction
of
airbags
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
achieving
that
safety
objective,
at
least
as
the
agency
understood
that
and
embodied
it
in
the
regulation.
for
these
reasons
which
we
elaborate
in
our
opinion,
we
agree
with
the
lower
federal
courts
that
the
regulation,
and
therefore
the
act
preempts
this
tort
suit.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter,
justice
thomas
and
justice
ginsburg
joined.
