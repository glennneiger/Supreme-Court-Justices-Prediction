mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
now
understand
that
petitioners'
position
is
that
what
he
calls
true
conflict
preemption
does
exist
despite
1397(k),
but
frustration
preemption
does
not
exist
despite
1397(k).
this
court
has
never
in
its
history
spread
apart
and
split
apart
those
two
forms
of
conflict
preemption.
every
time
the
court
has
articulated
the
doctrine
of
conflict
preemption,
it
has
done
so
by
pairing
impossibility
and
frustration.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
that's...
i
think
it's
his...
that
was
the
third
question
i
think
that
justice
breyer
asked,
justice
kennedy...
i'm
sorry...
justice
stevens.
the...
and
there
is
frustration
here.
the...
what
counsel
tries
to
put
the
full
weight
of
his
argument
on
is
the
single
sentence--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
what
it
means...
what
would
happen
is
that
the
manufacturers
would
be
driven
toward
investing
their
efforts
in
airbags
instead
of
in
the
diversity
of
restraint
systems
that
the
secretary
found
to
be
necessary
for
national
motor
vehicle
safety.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
both
a
greater...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
both
a
greater
proportion
and
perhaps
implemented
at
a
pace
that
the
secretary
thought
might
be
dangerous
to
the
public.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
well--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--excuse
me,
justice
stevens.
the...
the
premise
is...
is
somewhat
flawed.
in
fact,
as
of
1984,
mercedes
benz
had
implemented
airbags
on
an
optional
basis
into
its
largest
s
class
vehicles.
in
addition,
ford
motor
company
had
already
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
united
states
government,
the
government
services
administration,
to
install
airbags
in
5,000
tempo/topaz
vehicles.
so,
there
was
progress
being
made.
the
secretary
was
very
well
aware
of
that,
but
was
very
concerned,
as
she
expressed
in
great
detail
in
her
rulemaking,
that
to
push
it
any
faster
than
she
was
doing
through
the
10
percent
requirement
in
1987
risked
killing
people.
it
risked
injuring
people,
and
indeed
we
have
seen
subsequently
that
those
concerns
were
very
valid.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
pushing
manufacturers
to
go
beyond
that
is
what
the
frustration
would
be.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
because,
your
honor,
again
it's
a
very
complex
rulemaking,
and
what
she
was
concerned
about
was
that
manufacturers,
if
she
didn't
do
that,
would
be
trying
to
put
a
larger
number
of
passive
seatbelts
into
a
larger
number
of
cars
as
opposed
to
airbags.
by
giving
one
and
a
half
credits,
she
was
enabling
the
manufacturers
to
focus
some
of
their
resources
on
airbag
research
and
development
for
some
cars,
while
at
the
same
time
moving
forward
to
install
a
variety
of
other
kinds
of
seatbelt
systems
into
other
cars,
thereby
providing
the
public
with
a
diversity
that
she
thought
was
necessary.
and
to...
to...
most
importantly
perhaps,
to
obtain
the
field
data
to
answer
the
question
which--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--some
airbags.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
your
honor,
the
court...
this
court
has
said
many
times
that,
in
fact,
common
law
liability
does
set
standards,
and
it
said
that,
for
example,
in
cipollone.
it
has
said
it...
really
said
it
in
medtronic.
the...
there
is
no
question--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--because,
your
honor,
for
example,
let's
take
this
very
case.
this
plaintiff
is
seeking
$20,500,000
for
injuries
to
her
face
in
an
accident.
if
this
manufacturer...
if
honda
were
to
be
held
liable
for
$20,500,000,
or
perhaps
some
larger
number,
like
the
$4.1
billion
verdict
issued
against
general
motors
in
a
case
in
one
accident
just
earlier
this
summer,
that
manufacturer
would
have
to
be
totally
irrational
not
to
take
that
into
account
in
deciding
what
it
ought
to
do
and
where
it
ought
to
devote
its
research
resources
and
what
it
ought
to
put
into
its
vehicles.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
well,
it's
certainly
different
from
a
administrative
standard
and
different
from
a
legislative
standard
in
that
it
is
one
case
specific
standard.
but
again,
your
honor,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
if
you're
asking
under
the
language
of
this
particular
section
1392(d)
or
if
you're
asking
as
a
general
matter
is
there
something
odd
about
calling
a
common
law
standard
a
standard.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
your
honor,
i
fully
agree,
by
the
way,
that
there
in
fact
is
no
tension
between
section
1392(d)
and
1397(k)
but
for
a
very
different
reason.
and
the
reason
is
that
1397(k)
begins
with
two
words,
compliance
with,
that
defined
the
narrowness
of
its
scope.
it
is
not
an
anti-preemption
provision.
and...
and
there
has
been
no
decision
by
this
court
interpreting
a
provision
like
that
that
begins
with
the
words,
compliance
with,
as
being
an
anti-preemption
provision.
therefore,
there's
no
tension
literally--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--and
that's
because
the
assertion
is
not
compliance
with.
the
assertion
here
is
preemption
because
of
the
conflict
between
the
secretary's
purposes
in...
in
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
208
on
the
one
hand
and
the
common
law
standard
that...
that
the
petitioners
are
asserting.
we
don't
have
to
prove
compliance.
again,
if...
if
the
court
goes
back
and
looks
at
how
the
d.c.
circuit
decided
this
case,
how
the
district
court
decided
this
case,
how
it
was
defended,
and
how
it
was
argued,
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
compliance
literally
was
not
mentioned.
it
never
came
up.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
right.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
not
at
all,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--it
would
have
operation
and...
and
we
cited
this
case
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
in
the
perry
case,
perry
v.
mercedes
benz,
a
fifth
circuit
case,
1992...
it's
one,
by
the
way,
of
many
but
it
happens
to
be
a
particularly
illustrative
one.
there,
there
was
an
airbag
in
that
mercedes,
and
the
plaintiff
filed
a
claim
against
mercedes
benz
saying
the
airbag
should
have
deployed
at
a
different
threshold
level.
we
think
that
mercedes
set
the
threshold
level
too
high.
the
airbag
should
have
deployed
earlier.
that...
the
compliance
provision...
and
mercedes
tried
to
defend
on
the
ground
that,
well,
we
complied
with
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
208
by
putting
in
an
airbag.
and
the
plaintiff
said,
but
that's...
all
it
does
is
require
an
airbag.
it
doesn't
say
how
it
has
to
be
designed.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
i
beg
to
differ
with
your
honor.
the
fact
is
if
you
look
at
the
13
cases
cited
in
the
petitioners'
own
brief
at
footnote
2
of
their
opening
brief,
13
appellate
courts
had
to
address
the
question
that
manufacturers
raised
whether
compliance
with
a
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
that
did
not
address
the
specific
type
of
defect
that
plaintiff
was
asserting
nevertheless
constituted
an
affirmative
defense.
and
the
appellate
courts,
including
many
federal
circuit
courts,
said
the
compliance
provision
prevents
that.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
i
agree,
your
honor.
and
that...
and
that
is
exactly--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--well,
but...
but
again,
the
very
fact
we
have
13
reported
appellate
decisions
addressing
that
very
question
shows
that
it
had
meaning.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
the
defendants.
it
was
defendants.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
would
not
be
preempted.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
that
is
my
point.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
no,
your
honor.
the
premise
is...
is
wrong.
the
case
before
the
court
is
a
true
no-airbag
case.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
no,
your
honor.
what
they
had
was
manual
lap/shoulder
belts.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
but
that's
not
the
petitioners'
argument,
and
the
reason
it's
not
is
because
ms.
geier
was
wearing
her
lap
and
shoulder
belt.
therefore,
the
plaintiffs
couldn't
argue,
well,
there
should
have
been
a
passive
belt
because
she
was
belted.
so,
the
plaintiffs...
the
petition
simply
states
there
should
have
been
an
airbag
in
this
vehicle.
this
is
a
true--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--i
have
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
appears
at
49
federal
register,
page
29,000,
and
petitioners,
both
in
their
brief
and
again
in
oral
argument,
have
simply
ignored
the
preceding
paragraph
where
the
secretary
made
it
quite
clear
what
she
was
referring
to.
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
she
says,
the
phase-in
will
permit
the
manufacturers
to
ensure
that
whatever
system
they
use
is
effective,
trouble-free,
and
reliable.
and
later
on
in
the
next
paragraph,
she
refers
to
that
manufacturers
will
be
affected
by
product
liability
law
not
to
put
in
deficient
systems.
the
perry
case
that
i've
referred
to
already
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
exactly
that
situation.
we've
cited
other
cases
in
our
brief
that
are
exactly
that
situation.
the
secretary
wanted
to
use
product
liability
law
to
ensure...
to
help
to
ensure
that
if
you
put
in
an
automatic
belt
system,
it
wouldn't
be
a
defective
system.
if
you
put
in
an
airbag
system,
it
wouldn't
be
a
deficient
system.
but
she
was
not...
definitively
not...
saying
that
she
wanted
to
have
just
airbags.
and...
and
my
second
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
from
the
very
first
moment
that
the
secretary
was
asked
to
speak
to
what
it
was
that
she
intended
in
1988,
she
said...
the
secretary
said,
we
intend
preemption.
and
that
is
a
position
that
the
government
has
consistently
taken
for
more
than
a
decade.
so,
both...
that
was...
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
have
made
is
a
misreading
of
the
federal
register
and
it
certainly
misstates
the
position
of
the
government.
the...
i'd
like
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
1397(k)
again
and...
and
the
differences
between
it
and
typical
anti-preemption
provisions.
in
the
typical
anti-preemption
provisions
in
this
very
statute,
in
section
1392(d),
there
are
two
anti-preemption
provisions,
and
they
use
the
language
that
congress
always
uses
when
it
intends
to
limit
preemption.
they
begin
with
the
language
that
says,
nothing
in
this
section
shall
prevent
the
states
from
or
nothing
in
this
statute
shall
prevent
the
states
from.
1397(k)
begins
with,
compliance
with
a
standard
shall
not
affect...
or
not
exempt,
and
that
is
language
that
this
court
has
never
held
to
effect
an
anti-preemption
result.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
i
agree.
and
again,
i
agree
precisely
because
it
ties
into
standard
in
the
context
of
compliance
with.
and
if
the...
if
you
get
to
trial--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
i'm
arguing.
the...
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
get
to
the
question
of
proving
compliance
at
trial.
as
this
court
has
said
multiple
times,
in
preemption
the
court
looks
first
to
determine
what
is
the
interpretation
of
the
state
law
that's
being
asserted,
what
is
the
federal
statute,
and
then
asks
is
there
a
conflict.
what
gets
proved
at
trial
as
to
whether
there's
compliance
is
a
separate
question.
it
only
comes
up
if
the
manufacturer
asserts
compliance
as
an
affirmative
defense.
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision,
1397(k),
explicitly
refers
to
the
weight
of
evidence
and
it
makes
it
clear
that
that's
what
the
issue
was.
indeed,
in
the
d.c.
circuit...
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
compliance
is
considered
a
rebuttable
presumption.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
it's
unnecessary...
it's
irrelevant
in
the
sense
that
it's
unnecessary
to
ask
the
question,
justice
kennedy.
one
only
gets
to
that
question
if
you--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--because
the...
the
federal
regulation,
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
208,
is
what
conflicts
with
the
asserted
state
cause
of
action.
if
the--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--that's
partly
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
or
something
that's
on...
that's
not
quite
on
point,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--is
not
a
defense.
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
again,
even
if
you
read
it
as
a
minimum,
which
it
quite
clearly
is,
by
the
way...
the
secretary
didn't
say
that
manufacturers
can't
produce
more
than
that--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--what
is
preempted
is
the
forcing
of
the
manufacturers
to
go
to
anything
above
10
percent--
mr.
malcolm
e.
wheeler
--they're
forced
by
reality.
that's
exactly
right.
and
it's...
again,
what's
very
important
is
it's
not
just,
especially
in
this
case...
it's
not
just
being
forced
to
go
above
the
10
percent.
it's
being
forced
to
put
in
a
particular
kind
of
passive
restraint,
namely
airbags.
so,
the
secretary's...
both
of
her
purposes
were
being
frustrated.
they
were...
this...
the
petitioners
want
to
force
this
manufacturer
to
put
in
a
particular
type
of
passive
restraint
and
to
force
the
manufacturer,
which
was
above
10
percent,
to
go
even
further
above
10
percent.
and
if
i
may
finish,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
has
said,
with
respect
to
other
statutory
schemes
involving
broad
regulatory
authority
given
to
an
agency,
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
assume
that
congress
intended
that
kind
of
chaos
to
reign.
well,
that
is
exactly
what
we
would
have
here.
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
in
enacting
the
statute,
said...
they
expressed
concern
about
the
chaos
that
would
occur
if
all
50
states
could
regulate
independently,
and
that
is
exactly
what
these
types
of
tort
actions
would
do.
thank
you.
