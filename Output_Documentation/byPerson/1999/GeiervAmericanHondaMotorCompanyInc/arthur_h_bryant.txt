mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
claim
that
the
1987
honda
accord
in
this
case
was
defectively
designed
under
district
of
columbia
common
law
because
it
did
not
have
an
airbag
in
addition
to
a
manual
lap
belt
and
shoulder
harness.
there
are
two
primary
reasons
why
these
common
law
claims
are
not
preempted
here.
first,
secretary
dole
viewed
these
common
law
claims
as
furthering,
rather
than
frustrating,
the
policies
underlying
standard
208.
second,
even
if
secretary
dole
had
wanted
to
preempt
these
common
law
claims,
congress
expressly
denied
her
the
power
to
do
so.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
petitioners'
claims
were
seen
by
secretary
dole
as
furthering
the
policies
under
standard
208
is
because
she
herself
said
that.
in
explaining
the
rationale
for
adopting
the
rule,
she
said
that
she
would
rely
on,
quote,
the
potential
liability
for
deficient
systems,
end
quote,
to
make
sure
that
the
manufacturers
did
not
all
put
in
the
cheaper
passive
restraint,
automatic
seatbelts,
and
instead
started
putting
in
more
of
the
more
expensive
passive
restraint
airbags.
that
is
her
statement.
in
addition,
under
the
section
entitled
product
liability--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--that
is
in...
in
our...
the
blue
brief
at
page
10.
it
is--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--49
federal
register
29,000.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes.
it
is
in
the
preamble
to
the
rule
under
the
heading...
under
the
heading
rationale
for
adopting
the
rule.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
i
don't
think
she
saw
it
that
way
at...
at
all.
i...
i
think
we
have
to
start
with
the
understanding
that
secretary
dole
found
and
all
of
the
manufacturers
admitted
that
the
safest,
best
system
was
exactly
the
one
that
we
seek
to
have
installed
in
this
case,
an
airbag
plus
a
manual
lap
belt
and
shoulder
harness.
she
also
was
facing
this
court's
decision
remanding
the
last
rule
that
was
issued
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
it
didn't
consider
requiring
airbags
in
all
cars.
yet,
she
chose
not
to
order
airbags
in
all
cars
because
she
was
concerned
about
cost
considerations.
she
was
concerned
about
manufacturer
resistance,
public
acceptability,
technological
problems,
and
stifling
innovation.
the
reason
she
wanted
tort
liability
to
kick
in,
however,
was
because
she
knew...
and
she
said
it
clearly...
that
if
she
simply
required
passive
restraints
generally,
almost
all
the
manufacturers
would
put
in
automatic
seatbelts.
she
did
not
seek
tort
liability
because
of
the
cost
differences
and
these
other
factors
i've
mentioned.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
i
don't
put
the
weight
solely
on
that
sentence.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
that
is
what
we're
arguing
about
today.
but
i
think
when
the
government's
argument
is,
as
it
is
here,
that
the
sole
reason
for
preemption
is
a
frustration
of
one
of
the
secretary's
purposes
and
the
secretary
herself
refers
to
this
as
something
she
is
relying
on
as
creating
an
incentive
towards
doing
the
installation
of
airbags,
i
think
it
is...
it
carries
great
weight.
i--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--well,
disregarding
the
statement,
i
still
think,
in
terms
of
frustrating
the
policies
underlying
standard
208,
there
is
no
concern
about
frustrating
the
type
of
policies
as
justice
souter
was
talking
about.
because
of
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
enormous
cost
differences
and
the
other
factors
i've
talked
about,
not
only
did
the
secretary...
the
secretary,
leaving
common
law
liability
in
place,
still
thought
the
manufacturers
were
not
likely
to
install
airbags
enough,
and
that's
why
she
did
two
other
things
as
further
incentives
to
prompt
them
to
put
in
airbags.
first
of
all--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--well,
i
think--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--i
think
what
we
make
of
that
is,
as
the
united
states
itself
has
said,
there
is
no
express
preemption
whatsoever
of
common
law
claims
by
the
statute.
and
the
reason
i
was
going
to
standard
208
is
because
i
agree
with
the
united
states'
position
here.
i
do
think
that
1397(k)
by
its
very
terms...
and
it
was
the
second
argument
i
was
pointing
to...
denies...
expressly
denies
secretary
dole
the
power
to
preempt
common
law
claims.
it
says,
in
plain
and
unequivocal
terms,
compliance
with
any
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
does
not
exempt
any
person
from
any
liability
under
common
law.
and
their
basic
central
argument
in
this
case
is
compliance
with
this
federal
standard
does
exempt
this
person
from
this
liability
under
common
law.
it
cannot
be
squared
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
what
if
there
were
a
direct
conflict?
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
and
i
do...
it
is
important
to
point
out,
of
course,
there
is
no
direct
conflict
here.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
i
do
think
it
is
absolute,
and
let...
let
me
explain
why.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
words
clearly
cover
that
example.
second,
i...
i
believe
it
would
be
preempted,
but
it
would
not
succeed.
in
any
event,
it
could
not
prompt
the
defendant
to
violate
federal
law.
the
reason
i
say
it
would
not
succeed
is
because,
first
of
all,
at
least
no
good
lawyer
would
bring
a
case
arguing
that
the
defendant
acted
wrongfully
by
refusing
to
break
federal
law.
second,
in
almost
every
state
in
the
country
i
can
imagine,
a
judge
would
not
let
a
claim
like
that
get
to
a
jury
because
no
reasonable
jury
could
find--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes,
there
would
be
preemption
and
it
would
be--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--because
congress
intended
there
to
be
preemption
and
there
would
not
be
the
kind
of
direct
conflict,
that
is,
an
order
requiring
the
defendant
to
break
federal
law,
that
this
court
has
found
preempted.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--i
do
believe
that
that
is
what
it
says.
i
also
believe
it
is
absolutely
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
resolve
that
question
here.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary,
and
the
reason
is
because
this
case
is
about
frustration
of
purposes,
not
a
direct
conflict.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
i
agree,
but
i
would
say
two
things.
the
only
absurdity,
to
use
your
term,
justice
scalia,
that
you
focused
on
is
the
absurdity
of
ordering
someone
to
do
something
that
federal
law
prohibits.
and
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
case
what
we
are
seeking
to
hold
the
defendant
liable
for
is
for
failing
to
do
something
that
federal
law
both
permitted
and
encouraged,
but
more
importantly,
the
basic
assumption
of
absurdity
is
not
something
that
this
court
has
agreed
with
in
the
past.
in
the
cipollone
case,
under
the
1965
act,
this
court
held
plaintiffs
under
common
law
could
sue
for
failure
to
warn
even
though
the
warning
label
was
mandated
by
the
federal
government.
and
this
court
held
that
implied
conflict
preemption
should
not
be
looked
at.
and
it
also
held
that
the
'69
act
did
differently
and
it
could
understand
congress
taking
up
both
approaches.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
as
i
understood
your
hypothetical,
it
was
that
the
basis
of
liability
was
that
the
defendant
should
not
have
done
something
that
federal
law
required.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes,
and
that
was
that
one
of
the
theories
of
liability
permitted
under
the
'65
act
in
cipollone,
that
it
was
a
failure
to
warn
because
they
did
what
federal
law
required
them
to
do,
put
on
these
warning
labels,
instead
of
something
else.
that
was
the
'65
act--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--well,
they
could
have
done
that,
but
they
also...
one
of--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
that...
that's
not
my
position
in
two
respects.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe...
and
i
don't
think
congress
believed...
that
the
common
law
claim
would
actually
require
you
to
do
anything
other
than
pay
money.
and
that
is,
there
is
no
physical
impossibility
possible
here.
there
is
at
most
a
tension
between
a
requirement
that
you
pay
money
and
change
your
conduct.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
not
at
all.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
if
i
may--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--first
of
all,
i
don't--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--first
of
all,
i
don't
think
they're
rational.
they
make
cost/benefit
calculations.
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
if
they
bear
any
cost,
they
change
their...
their
conduct.
it
depends
on
how
much--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
i
think
it's
part
of
their
thought
process.
i
think
they
also
consider
what
would
the
cost
be
of
injuries
caused
by
airbags
and
of
no
automatic
seatbelt
injuries,
and
they
do--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
to
be
clear,
congress
could
reasonably
preempt
common
law
claims
like
the
type
we're
talking
about.
congress
could
leave
some
in
place
and
some
not
in
place,
and
congress--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--yes.
common
law
claims
can
have
a
regulatory
impact.
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
preempt
the
specific
common
law
claims
at
issue.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
no.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
i
didn't
take
you
as
arguing
against
me.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
i
think--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--well,
as
to
step
two...
as
to
step
two,
i
think
congress'
words
plainly
say
that,
when
we're
talking
about
frustration
of
policies
of
the
secretary,
regardless
of
what
the
rule
is
as
to
conflict,
there
there
is
no
preemption.
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
justice
scalia.
that
is,
the
congress
did
not
give
the
secretary
the
power
to
say,
in
passing
this
standard,
i
have
a
bunch
of
policies
and
one
of
my
policies
will
be
frustrated
by
common
law
claims,
and
therefore
i
pick
out
these
common
law
claims
and
preempt
them.
and
i
believe
section
1397(k)
has
to
be
read
fairly
to
include
that
kind
of
decision.
that's
why
i
was
saying
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
answer
question
one.
it's
not
presented
here.
but
question
two
is,
and
i
believe
1397(k)
answers
question
two
and
it
answers
question
two
by
saying,
no,
there
is
no
preemption
on
this
kind
of
an
approach.
if
there
can
be
preemption
on
this
kind
of
approach,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
are
essentially
reading
1397(k)
out
of
the
act,
or
at
least
limiting
it
so
severely
as
to
wonder
why
congress
put
it
in
there.
the
secretary...
but
i...
i
do
want
to
get
back
for
a
second
to
what
the
secretary
did
here.
it's
relevant
in
my
view
both
to
section...
question
two,
somewhat,
but
particularly
to
question
three.
and
that
is,
justice
breyer,
unlike
the
example
that
you
gave
in
medtronic
where
one
of
the
beauties
of
giving
it...
the
power
to
the
agency
is
that
they
can...
the
agency
can
lay
out
its
reasons
and
predict
what
its
purposes
are
and
say
what's
preempted
and
not
preempted,
et
cetera.
there
is...
this
secretary
not
only
made
the
comment
that
i
started
my
conversation
with,
but
also
made
no
comment
whatsoever
anywhere
suggesting
in
any
place
that
she
intended
to
eliminate
a
common
law
claim.
indeed,
the
entire
structure
of
her
approach
was
to
not
impose
airbags
on
everyone,
but
rather
to
create...
to
trust
it
to
the
market.
and
part
of
the
market
she
was
trusting
was
the
tort
liability
system
to
internalize
both
the
costs
and
the
benefits
of
airbags
versus
automatic
restraints
of
other
types
versus
anything
else
that
might
come
along
in
the
future.
i
think
it
was
an
absolutely
reasonable
regulatory
approach,
but
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
whatsoever
either
that
she
considered
preempting
common
law
claims
or
suggested
it.
so,
what
would
happen
here
is
we
would
be
talking
about
not
a
situation
where
either
the
congress
or
the
secretary
expressly
preempted
common
law
claims,
we'd
be
talking...
or
where
the
secretary
even
suggested
a
problem
with
common
law
claims--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--no,
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--i
don't
accept
that.
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading.
i
think
when
the
secretary
acts,
first
of
all,
in
the
face
of
a
savings
clause
like
this
one,
and
in
the
face
of
the
presumption
against
preemption,
and
she
starts
there
and
then
she
says
that
she
intends
to
rely
on
potential
liability
for
deficient
systems
to
help
her
achieve
her
goals
of
pushing
people
away
from
automatic
seatbelts
and
towards
airbags,
then
later
on
in
her
rationale
she
actually
quotes
and
describes...
using
her
terms,
she...
she
calls
it
another
potential
source
of
liability
for
the
manufacturers.
she
specifically
refers
to
no
airbag
claims
again.
and
then
she
says
nothing
whatsoever
to
suggest
that
she's
eliminating
common
law
claims,
but
several
times
says
that
her
concern
with
leaving
it
to
the
market,
without
any
additions
from
her,
is
that
even
with
the
tort
liability,
there
will
not
be
enough
airbags
installed
and
people
will
put
in
automatic
seatbelts
because
they're
so
much
cheaper.
and
so,
she's
not
only
using
tort
liability,
but
she's
also
phasing
in
the
system
over
several
years
because
she
explains
that
will
prompt
more
manufacturers
to
put
in
airbags.
and
she
gives
them
an
extra
credit
for
putting
in
cars
with
airbags;
that
is,
she
says,
i
would
rather
have
500...
50,000
cars
on
the
road
with
airbags
than
750,000...
i'm
sorry...
than
75,000
cars
on
the
road
with
automatic
seatbelts.
she
hasn't
simply
thrown
up
her
hands
and
left
it
alone.
she
has
put
together
a
quite
cohesive
structure,
which
is
i'm
not
going
to
impose
this
on
high,
but
i
am
going
to
create
an
incentive
system
to
prompt
more
airbags
in
cars
and
i'm
going
to
leave
it
to
the
marketplace,
including
tort
liability,
to
ultimately
drive
the
manufacturers
to
the
right
decision,
whatever
that
decision
may
be.
now,
the
federal
government's
response
to
this...
and
they
concede
there
is
no
conflict
here.
their
sole
response
to
this
is
that
this
frustrates
the
secretary's
desires
to
have
a
diversity
of
passive
restraints.
but
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
wrong
for
five
reasons.
first,
that
wasn't
the
secretary's
view.
the
secretary
viewed
tort
liability
as
enhancing
diversity
both
generally
and
specifically,
and
i
say
specifically
because
given
the
cost
considerations
involved,
she
felt
if
there
were
not
tort
liability,
there
would
not
be
as
many
airbags.
and
so,
this
would
actually
enhance
the
diversity.
second,
it
ignores
what
happened.
the
entire
theory
the
government
advances
here
is
that
if
the
manufacturers
had
had
reason
to
believe
they
could
have
been
held
liable,
then
they
all
would
have
put
in
airbags.
well,
they
did
have
reason
to
believe
they
could
have
been
held
liable.
in
fact,
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
in
1984
that
they
couldn't
have
been
held
liable.
there
was
never,
at
that
time,
even
a
court
case
finding
preemption.
and
the
secretary
had
said
everything
she
said.
and
yet,
what
did
they
do?
they
did
not
put
airbags
in
most
cars.
third,
it
assumes
that
tort
liability
leads
to
everybody
putting
in
airbags.
and
i
don't
think
it
does
as
a
logical
matter
because
once
you
preserved
all
tort
liability,
the
manufacturers
are
going
to
look
at
different
cars
and
say,
for
these
cars
the
cost
and
benefit
calculation
may
be
worth
it;
for
these
cars
the
cost
and
benefit
calculation
may
not
be
worth
it.
they're
going
to
look
at
all
of
the
kinds
of
cases
that
we
read
about
in
the
newspaper
of
people
suing
saying,
the
airbags
shouldn't
have
been
in
my
cars,
and
know
that
they
feared
that
liability
as
well.
and
so,
it
does
not
in
any
way
inevitably
lead
to
airbags
being
put
in
cars,
as
it
has
not.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
i
think
the
single
biggest
change
was
that
in
1991
congress
amended
the
act
to
require
the
secretary
to
install
airbags
in
all
cars
as
of
19...
all
new
cars
as
of
1998.
and
so,
even
if
you're
looking
at
it
in
sort
of
the
practical
effect
from
here
forward,
no
one
can
seriously
argue
the
practical
effect,
even
if
now
all
the
manufacturers
ran
out
and
retrofitted
their
cars
with
airbags
in
response
to
this
case,
would
be
anti-safety.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't...
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
well,
as
i--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--as...
as
i
said...
i'm
sorry.
are
you
talking
about
a
theory
of
liability
that
the
airbag
shouldn't
have
been
there
at
all
as
opposed
to
defective
design
of
the
airbag
or
something
like
that?
yes.
as
i
said,
i
do
believe
congress
preserved
those.
i
also
believe
this
court
does
not
have
to
resolve
that
at
all
to
get
there.
and
i
also
believe,
in
terms
of
the
real
world,
it
is
a
total
red
herring
because
people
will
not
bring
those
suits.
the
courts
and
the
states
do
not
allow
those
suits.
the
practical
reality
is
that's
not
something
anybody
needed
to
fear.
now,
one
of
the
questions
is,
well,
all
right,
even
putting
that
aside,
why
would
congress
do
what
it
did
and
treat
these
differently?
i
think
the
basic
answer
is
that
congress
was
interested
in
helping
to
protect
potential
victims
of
crashes,
and
it
knew
it
couldn't
prevent
all
of
the...
prevent
injury
to
all
of
those
victims.
and
so,
when
you
come
to
the
common
law,
the
question
is
whether
you're
going
to
hurt
those
people
or
help
them.
if
it
preempted
some
common
law
claims,
then
the
people
who
were
hurt
at
the
end
would
actually
have
been
hurt
by
congress'
actions
as
well.
that's
the
position
they're
saying
our
clients
are
in.
they're
saying
that
the
geiers,
unlike
people
who
were
hurt
in
cars
before
1984,
and
unlike
people
who
were
hurt
in
crashes
other
than
automobiles,
trucks,
mini-vans,
et
cetera--
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
--yes,
i
do
recognize
the
tension.
i
think
the
ultimate
question
here
is
whether
congress'
approach
as
to
that
tension,
leaving
both
in
place,
needs
to
be
respected
or
not.
i
submit
they
do.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
arthur
h.
bryant
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
might
be
frustration
of
purposes
here
if
the
secretary
had
placed
a
ceiling
on
the
number
of
cars
with
passive
restraints
generally
or
airbags
specifically,
discouraged
manufacturers
from
installing
passive
restraints
generally
or
airbags
specifically,
or
suggested
in
any
way
that
tort
liability
would
conflict
with
her
policies
and
that
she
intended
to
create
some
sort
of
liability-free
zone.
none
of
those
are
true.
the
opposite
is
true.
she
placed
no
limit
on
the
number
of
passive
restraints.
she
placed
no
limit
on
the
number
of
airbags,
and
she
said
she
wanted
to
encourage
both
of
them.
in
addition,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
the
fact
that
you
noted
that
this
particular
car
had
no
passive
restraints
is
critical.
the
argument
about
diversity
of
passive
restraints
and
an
airbag
claim
conflicting
with
that
could
theoretically
apply
if
we
were
arguing
it
should
have
had
an
airbag
instead
of
an
automatic
seatbelt.
but
when
the
car
had
no
passive
restraints
at
all,
to
say
they
should
have
put
an
airbag
in
it
cannot,
as
a
matter
of
pure,
practical
logic,
in
any
way
affect
the
diversity
of
what's
put
in
cars
that
have
automatic...
i'm
sorry...
that
have
passive
restraints
in
them.
so,
it
doesn't
get
to
the
government's
theory
at
all.
and
the
response
that
mr.
wheeler
gave
you
about,
well,
she
was
wearing
her
seatbelt
would
make
preemption
turn
on
whether
a
person
was
wearing
a
seatbelt
or
not
and
actually
make
them
worse
off
via
preemption
because
they
were
wearing
the
seatbelt
than
they
would
be
if
they
weren't
wearing
the
seatbelt.
and,
of
course,
we're
trying
to
encourage
people
to
wear
seatbelts.
i
think
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
congress
or
secretary
dole
ever
intended
the
manufacturers
to
be
free
from
liability
for
failing
to
install
the
precise
system
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
found
and
the
manufacturers
admitted
was
the
best
and
safest
system,
an
airbag
plus
a
manual
lap
belt
and
shoulder
harness.
we
say
section
1397(k)
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
no
such
result
and
the
secretary's
entire
statement
and
structure
of
the
standard
makes
clear
she
intended
no
such
result.
and
the
notion
that
somehow
a
finding
that
the
manufacturers
can't
be
held
liable
for
failing
to
install
what
the
secretary
herself
said
was
the
best
system
because
that
would
somehow
frustrate
the
secretary's
policies
is,
we
submit,
nonsensical
on
its
face.
thank
you
very
much.
