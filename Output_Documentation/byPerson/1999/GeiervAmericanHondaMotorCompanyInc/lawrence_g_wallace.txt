mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
last
time...
we
agree,
i
should
start
off,
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
is
a
case
of
implied
conflict
preemption.
the
last
time
this
statute
was
before
the
court
in
freightliner
against
myrick,
the
court
engaged
in
an
implied
conflict
preemption
analysis
and
mentioned
that
there
are
two
categories
of
implied
conflict
preemption:
the
impossibility
to
comply
with
both
the
state
and
federal
requirements
or
the
classic
kinds
against
davidowitz,
which
has
been
referred
to
as
the
frustration
category
of
implied
conflict
preemption.
and
that
is
the
one
that
is
relevant
here.
we
are
talking
only
about
the
version
of
standard
208
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
this
car
was
manufactured.
it
was
an
evolutionary
version
of
standard
208
that
was
adopted
after
a
lengthy
rulemaking
proceeding
in
which
the
secretary
recognized
certain
then-existing
problems,
one
of
which
was
great
public
resistance
to
airbags
which,
as
we
say
in
footnote
20,
airbags
engendered
the
largest
quantity
and
most
vociferously
worded
comments
during
the
rulemaking.
there
was
a
proposal
before
the
secretary
to
develop...
to
adopt
an
all-airbag
rule
at
that
time,
which
she
rejected
in
favor
of
a
rule
encouraging
a
variety
of
passive
restraints
in
a
proportion
of
the
vehicles
based
on
a
conclusion
that
at
that
time
diversity
would
best
promote
safety
by
promoting
public
acceptance
of
the
passive
restraints,
by
enabling
the
development
of
new
and
improved
technologies,
and
enabling
the
agency
to
acquire
more
data
to
take
the
next
step
in
this
evolutionary
process--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
of
which
were
necessary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we...
we
describe
that,
and
we
think
accurately,
in
context
as
a
reasonable
incentive
to
ensure
that
airbags
would
be
in
the
mix
of
passive
restraints
since
she
did
not
impose
a
requirement.
one
of
the
concerns
was
that
seatbelts
often
were
not
buckled
in
those
days,
and
if
airbags
were
the
restraint
someone
was
relying
on,
they
might
actually
be
in
greater
danger
because
they'd
be
riding
without
their
seatbelt
buckled,
and
they'd
be
vulnerable
to
other
kinds
of
accidents
in
which
the
airbag
would
not
deploy.
that
was
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
passive
seatbelt
restraint
against
the
airbags.
these
had
to
be
analyzed
at
the
time
in
terms
of
public
acceptability
and
in
light
of
the
experience
the
department
had
just
had
with
resistance
to
the
ignition
interlock
system
that
they
had
had
to
compel
the
public
to
buckle
up
and
the
congressional
action
that
followed
repealing
that
because
of
public
resistance.
so,
we're
talking
about
a...
what
were
the
implications
of
this
version
of
the
rule
during
a
particular
period.
now,
we
have
been
very
mindful
in
this
series
of
filings
addressing
this
subject
which
three
solicitors
general
have
submitted
and
we've
cited
them
to
you.
we've
been
very
mindful
that
this
statute
is
one
that
imposes
only
minimum
standards
that
are
adopted
by
the
secretary.
that
means
that
in
the
ordinary
case
the
manufacturers
are
free
to
exceed
the
standard,
and
the
implication
would
be
that
state
law
could
not
with
a
rival
prescribe
standards
through
administrative
agencies
but,
through
the
tort
suit
system
that
is
preserved,
could
hold
the
manufacturers
to
a
higher
standard.
but
in...
in
the
version
of
208
that
was
in
effect
at
this
time,
allowing
a
suit
based
on
a
theory
that
it
was
a
design
defect
not
to
have
an
airbag
in
a
1987
car,
this
is
not
just
a
question
of
what
a
jury
will
find
on
its
own
but
what
theory
can
be
presented
to
the
jury
and
what
the
jury
can
be
instructed,
that
that
would
frustrate
the
secretary's
finding--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we...
we're
really...
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the...
the
percentage
question
really
has
to
do
with
the
transitional
nature
of
the
rule,
which
we
understand
not
to
be
at
issue
in
this
case
because
the
complaint
here
is
not
that
there
was
no
passive
restraint
in
the
car.
the
complaint
is
only
that
every
car
had
to
have
a
particular
kind
of
passive
restraint,
every
car,
and
that's
an
airbag.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we...
we
tried--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it...
it
is...
it
is
a
variety
of
the...
of
the
more
basic
point
that
it
would
undermine
the
policy
determination
at
that
time
that
there
had
to
be
a
variety
of
occupant
restraints
available
in
the
cars
to
go
through
this
evolutionary
period.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is...
we're
not
saying
that...
that
other
theories
of
common
law
liability
would
not
be
available.
for
example,
a...
a
theory
that
a
particular
airbag
installation
was
defective
or
the
airbag
itself
was
defective--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--even
if
that...
even
if
that
airbag
met
the
standard
for
an
airbag
was
what
i
was
about
to
say
so
that
otherwise
meeting
the...
the
standard
for
manufacturing
or
installing
an
airbag
might
be
thought
to
be
a
defense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we're...
we're
talking
about
provisions--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but...
but
the
secretary's
standards
prescribe
minimum
standards
for
many
kinds
things.
the
brakes
have
to
stop
within
a
certain
distance.
it
may
be
that
even
if
you
meet
that
standard,
it
could
be
a
design
defect
if
they
didn't
exceed
that
standard
by
a
reasonably
specified
amount
under
state
tort
law.
that
kind
of
thing
is
saved
by
this
clause.
we're
not...
we're
not
talking
about
a...
an
intent
to
preempt.
we're
talking
here
about
a...
a
kind
of
preemption
that
flows
directly
from
the
supremacy
clause
itself
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
applying
the
state
law
in
the
way
it's
being
applied
and
the
achievement
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
federal
law.
and
federal
law,
as
the
court
said
in
city
of
new
york--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--regulations
of
the
agency.
