unknown
speaker
where
does...
where
does
that
appear?
unknown
speaker
and
it's...
it's
taken
from
what?
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
statement
of
basis
and
purpose
for
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
find
the...
the
statement
you
just
quoted
a...
a
troubling
one
for
the
other
side,
i...
i
agree.
but
i...
i
still
have
difficulty
in
accepting
it
as...
as
the...
with...
as
having
the
significance
for
your
side
that
you
want
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if,
in
making
that
statement,
she
in
effect
was
alluding
to
the
significance
or
the
power
of
the
common
law
to,
in
effect,
adopt
the
very
rule
that
she
was
declining
to
adopt...
i.e.,
you
got
to
have
the
airbags...
then
she
was,
in
effect,
saying
i'm
relying
upon
the
common
law
to
thwart
the
very
judgment
that
i
am
making
now.
and
that
seems
very
odd.
what...
what
do
you
make
of
that?
unknown
speaker
that
seems
like
a
very
great
weight
to
put
on
a...
a
single
sentence
in...
in
a
preamble,
particularly
when
the
government
takes
the
other
position
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
shouldn't
put
any
weight
on
it.
i
mean,
she
does
say
that
competition...
potential
liability
for
any
deficient
systems.
i
mean,
she
may
be
saying,
you
know,
i
don't
know
any
more
about
whether
there's
preemption
than
the
supreme
court
does.
we'll
have
to
have
a
lawsuit.
[laughter]
there...
there
is
potential
liability
for
deficient
systems.
that's
exactly
what
we're
arguing
about
today,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we...
what
if
we
get
away
from
that
statement
and
just
look
at
the
statutes?
do
you
want
to
address
where
we
are
then,
disregarding
that
statement
of
secretary
dole?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wish
you'd
get
back
to
my
question,
though,
and
stop
speculating
on
what
secretary
dole
was
thinking
and
tell
us
what
the
statutes
mean
because
i
think
that
will
be
very
strongly
part
of
our
necessary
decision
making
in
the
case,
and
you
can
help
us
by
focusing
on
what
these
two
statutes
read
together
mean
because
it's
so
unusual
to
have
the
subject
dealt
with
in
two
separate
sections
rather
than
one.
and
in
a
circumstance
where
the
natural
reading
of
standard
in
section
1392(d)
would
include
state
common
law
standards
of
care,
and
yet,
several
sections
down,
we
find
section
1397(k).
and
what
do
we
make
of
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
how
do
we
deal
with
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
said
that
you
have
to
install
seat
bags
and...
airbags
and
a
state
common
law
decision
was
that
you're
liable
because
you
installed
airbags.
i
mean,
you
know,
airbags
they
think
are
dangerous.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes,
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
you're
making--
unknown
speaker
--an
absolute
argument,
and
i'm
just
saying
i
don't
see
how
it
could
possibly
be
absolute.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
you
could
say...
i
bet
your
opponent
said
exactly
the
same
thing
about
this
case.
you
know,
i
mean--
[laughter]
--we
hear
that
argument
a
lot.
and
i
mean,
obviously
you
could
have
a
child
who
was
killed
when
an
airbag
came
out
and
somebody
said
that
the
whole
system
is
no
good
and
it
was
no
good
from
day
one
and
they
gave
in
to
political
pressure.
i'll
spare
you
the
details.
but
i
want
to
know
your
answer
to
my
imagined
case.
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
imagined
case
is
a
jury
does
come
in
and
the
state
does
uphold
it,
and
they
are
liable
because
they
installed
airbags.
all
right?
unknown
speaker
and
now,
in
that
case,
would
there
be
preemption?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
because...
because
congress
intended
it
to
be
preempted.
unknown
speaker
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your...
your
response.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
is
that...
that
the
preemptive...
strike
that...
the
non-preemptive
effect
that
you
attribute
to
the
later
statutory
provision
which
preserves
the
common
law
is
so
broad
that
if
we
accept
your
argument,
it
means
that
even
when
the
federal
standard
says
you
shall
install
airbags,
a
state
common
law
provision
can
say
you
shall
not
install
airbags.
and
that
common
law
would
prevail
over
the
federal
law--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
read
that
provision
the
way
you
want
us
to.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
is
to
accept
your
argument
because--
unknown
speaker
--that
seems
to
me
absurd.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
to
accept
your
categorical
reading
of
that
provision,
if
i
see
that
that
reading
is
going
to
lead
to
this
absurd
conclusion,
i
might
look
around
for
a
different
reading.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
not
my
hypothetical.
i
mean,
cipollone
would
have
been
my
hypothetical
if
the...
if
the
federal
government
said
you
shall
not
warn
and
the
state
held
them
liable
for
not
warning.
unknown
speaker
required
him
to
do.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they...
they
could
have
put
on
those
warning
labels
and
put
on
something
else
as
well.
unknown
speaker
--necessary
conflict.
there
was
no
necessary
conflict.
well,
anyway--
unknown
speaker
--you...
you
don't...
you
offer
me
no...
no
assistance.
you...
you
say
that...
that
if
i
accept
your
interpretation
of
what
the
common
law
provision
means,
i
am
indeed
led
to
the
conclusion
that
a
state
common
law
provision
that
requires
you
to
do
the
opposite
of...
of
what
the
federal
statute
requires
is
valid.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--then
you
must...
you
must
think
that
auto
manufacturers
are
irrational.
if
they
have
to
pay
money--
unknown
speaker
--they're
going
to
change
their
behavior
so
that
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
more
money,
and
that's
the
point
at
which
you
get
to
the
frustration.
right.
unknown
speaker
and
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
state
criminal
law.
hey,
you
don't
have
to
violate
the...
the
federal
law.
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
to
jail--
[laughter]
--for
violating
the
federal
law.
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
free
choice.
unknown
speaker
they
can
multiply.
they
can
multiply,
and
they
can
envision
future
accidents.
unknown
speaker
and
the
price
goes
up.
don't
you
think
that's
their
thought
process?
unknown
speaker
one--
unknown
speaker
--one...
one
hears
defense
of
large
verdicts
for
plaintiffs
frequently
as
saying
this
will
make
the
manufacturer
take
notice
and
keep
it
safe.
there's
certainly
inconsistency
between
that
and
what
you're
saying
i
think.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
answer
my
question
at
all
what
you're
saying
now.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
i
can
get
out
of
what
you're
saying
is
the
answer
would
be
let
the
manufacturer
pay
for
all
airbag
related
accidents,
whatever
the
cause,
whatever
the
inconsistency,
and
that
will
put
cost
pressure
on
the
manufacturer
to
figure
out
the
best
system.
unknown
speaker
now,
that...
but
that's...
i
mean,
that's
in
your
favor.
i'm
not
arguing
against
you
there.
i
didn't
think
i
was.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
right.
so...
so,
but
i
mean,
that...
that
would
try
to
reconcile
these
things,
say
it's
just
a
money
judgment,
they'll...
but
that's
a
theory
i've
never
seen
congress
buy.
and...
and
the
reason
i
want
you
to
focus
on
this
is,
for
better
or
for
worse,
i
did
start
question
one,
what
about
conflict?
unknown
speaker
direct
conflict
i
think
we
both
now
agree
congress
preempts.
now,
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be
yes
or
no.
i
thought
the
answer
is
yes,
preempt.
then
i
get
to
question
two,
and
question
two
is,
why
would
interference
in
any
significant
way
with
the
purpose
of
a
regulation
be
treated
differently?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
it
isn't,
i
get
to
question
three,
which
is
what
is
the
purpose
here.
all
right?
i
expose
my
thinking
on
this
so
that
you
can
tell
me
whether
i'm...
you
already
said
i'm
wrong
at
step
three,
or
you
know,
i
haven't
taken
a
view
on
that.
unknown
speaker
but
as
to
step
one
and
step
two--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
i'm
right
as
to
step
one.
what
about
step
two?
unknown
speaker
we'd
be
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
the
secretary
had
done
absolutely
nothing.
and
i
think
what
you're
telling
us
is,
at
least
so
far
as
this
point
is
concerned,
that
this
combination
of...
of
regulations
boils
down,
in
effect,
to
inanition
on
the
secretary's
part,
just
sort
of
throwing
her
hands
up
and
saying,
well,
let
the
market
figure
it
out.
unknown
speaker
we...
we
can't
accept
that.
unknown
speaker
how
has
the
regulatory
scheme
changed
since
this
accident
occurred?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
current
regime,
you
would
say
that
there
still
could
be
a
state
common
law
suit
because
the
airbag
had
been
installed
and
it
damaged
someone.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
under
the
present
regulatory
scheme
requiring
the
airbags,
you
would
still
argue
that
a
state
or
the
district
of
columbia
could
in
its
common
law
find
negligence
by
virtue
of
the
installation
of
the
airbag,
by
virtue
of
having
it
because
it
damaged
someone--
unknown
speaker
--when
it
deployed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryant,
don't
you
recognize
some
tension
between
1392(d)
and
1397(k)?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bryant.
mr.
wheeler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
no.
his
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
there
in
fact
is
no
frustration
here.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
frustration?
is
it
that
if
you
do
not
preempt
the
common
law
cause
of
action,
it
will
mean
that
there
will
be
a
total
adoption
of
seatbelts...
i
mean,
of
airbags?
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
would
be
more...
a
greater
proportion
of
airbags
than
the
secretary
desired.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
that
is
that
prior
to
the
regulation
going
into
effect,
where
there
wasn't
even
arguable
preemption,
apparently
the
rate
of
installation
of
airbags
was
zero.
so
that
the
absence
of
preemption
does
not
equate
with
total
adoption
or
even
rapid
adoption
of
airbags--
unknown
speaker
--because
we
have
a
history
of
several
years
before
1984.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
frustration
is
that
the
rate
might
be
larger
than
10
percent.
that's
sort
of
a
fixed
ceiling
in
her
view
and
it's
frustration
of
the
ceiling
that...
that
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
what
was
her
purpose...
what
was
her
purpose
then
in
counting
the
airbag
one
and
a
half
as
against
the
seatbelt,
only
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
like
she
was
trying
to
promote
putting
in
airbags
to
that
extent
by
saying
they're
not
all
equal,
i
want
to
give
a
little
shove.
unknown
speaker
but
one
basic
part
of
your
case
that
i
don't
understand
is
a
tort
suit
doesn't
set
a
standard
the
way
the
secretary
does.
you...
you...
that
seems
to
be
essential
to
your
argument
that...
that
common
law
liability
sets
a
standard,
but
common
law
liability
zeroes
in
on
one
particular
model
by
one
particular
manufacturer,
and
it
doesn't
set
any
across-the-board
standard
for
anyone.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
explain
to
me
how
a
particular
jury
verdict
with
respect
to
one
particular
model
would
then
control
all
models
that
by
that
manufacturer
and,
moreover,
all
models
by
every
other
manufacturer.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
asking
you
to
tell
me
why
that
liability
is
a
standard.
after
all,
a
common
law
liability...
it's
a
jury
verdict
based
on
particular
evidence.
one
jury
could
come
out
one
way;
another
jury
could
come
out
another
way.
so,
that
sounds
to
me
very
far
from
what
is
a
standard,
and
that's
the
simple
question
i'm
asking
you.
it
seems
like
a
common
law
jury
verdict
is
very
far
from
a
standard.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
looking
at
two
sections
of
the
statute
that
seem
to
be
in
tension.
then
i
said,
well,
maybe
they're
not.
maybe
common
law
liability
means
a
tort
suit
applying
general
principles
of
common
law,
and
maybe
standard
means
something
the
legislature
enacts
or
an
administrative
body
sets
for
across
the
board.
unknown
speaker
explain
to
me
why
it
isn't.
it
says,
compliance
with
the
safety
standard
won't
be
a
complete
defense
for
common
law
actions.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
because
if
there's
preemption,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
compliance.
unknown
speaker
what
that
suggests
is
that
the
compliance
provision
makes
no
sense
if
we
agree
with
you
about
the
preemption
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
how
the
compliance
provision
would
have
operation
if
you
read
the
preemption
provisions
as
including
preemption
of...
of
state
common
law.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
but
that's
just
like
saying
we
complied
with
the
federal
standard
by...
by
having
doors
on
the
car.
i
mean,
that...
that's
surely
not
what
the
compliance
provision
means.
it
means
compliance
as
to
the
very
matter
that
the
suit
is
about.
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
it's...
it's
meaningless.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
wouldn't
take
me
a
whole
lot
of
time
to...
to
come
to
that
conclusion
by
just
saying,
you
know,
the...
the
provision
at
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
car
should
have
doors.
the
provision
here
is...
is
the
airbag.
and
you'd
come
in
and
you'd
say,
well,
i
was
in
compliance
with
the
door
provision.
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
and
it's...
it's
the
same
where
you
say,
you
know,
the...
the
airbag
was
defective
for
some
reason.
you
say,
well,
i
was
in
compliance
with
the
provision
of
having
an
airbag.
well,
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
converts...
it
converts
that
into
a
meaningless
provision.
unknown
speaker
that
plaintiffs
make
some...
some
meaningless
arguments
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
the
defendants,
yes.
i'm...
i'm
confused
on
that
point
because
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
that
you
could
have
a
reg,
say
a
door
reg,
and
that
some
certain
tort
theories
would
interfere
with
the
purpose
and
they
would
be
preempted.
unknown
speaker
but
other
tort
theories
might
really
not
interfere
with
the
purpose
and
they
wouldn't
be.
unknown
speaker
and
then...
and
then
compliance
in
such
a
case
would
not,
in
fact,
excuse
the
tort
action
that
wasn't
preempted.
unknown
speaker
that's
your...
that's
your
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
very
well.
if
that's
your
point,
why
does
this
fall
into
the
first
category
and
what
you've
talked
about
is
it
would
make
the
manufacturers
produce
more
airbags?
but
that's
what
i'm
not
really
certain
about.
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
a
passive
restraint
standard.
and
the
whole
point
of
manufacturers'
choice
there
was
that
they
could
put
in
either
airbags
or
spoolable
belts
or
unlockable
belts.
and
we,
says
the
secretary,
will
never
tell
you
which.
but
this
theory
isn't
dependent
on
which
of
the
three
they
put
in,
is
it?
i
mean,
isn't
the
case...
aren't
the
cases
in
front
of
us
cases
that
rest
upon
their
failure
to
put
in
passive
restraints?
period.
and
if
that's
so,
then
how
do
they
interfere
with
the
purpose
of
the
reg
which
was
to
encourage
passive
restraints
but
not
to
tell
the
manufacturers
which
of
the
three
systems
they
ought
to
choose?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
they
had...
they
didn't
have
airbags,
but
they
did
have
spoolable
belts?
did
they
have
spoolable
belts
or
did
they
have
unlockable
belts?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
they
didn't
have
passive
restraints.
unknown
speaker
what
is...
what
is
the
response
that
you
then
make
to
their
initial
point
about
secretary
dole
having
said
we're
going
to
rely
upon
the
tort
system
to
help
enforce
this?
unknown
speaker
but
it
makes
sense
because
it's
tied
into
1392(d)
which
talks
about
standards
to
have
the
97
provision
relate
to
standards.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
just
going
back
to
the
language,
just...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
point.
is
it
not
true
that
you...
you
are
arguing
today
that
compliance
with
the
then
existing
regulation
exempts
your
client
from
liability
under
common
law?
unknown
speaker
so,
are
you
saying
that
it's
irrelevant
that
you
were
within
the...
the...
that
you
were
obeying
the
federal
regulations?
unknown
speaker
but
you
cite...
but
you
cite
the
statute.
you...
you
cite
the
safety
standard
as...
as
the
grounds
for...
for
being
entitled
to
have
the
complaint
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
you
argue
that
frustration
itself...
if
you
get
more
than
10
percent...
preempts
the
cause
of
action,
so
you
don't
need
an
affirmative
defense.
that's
why
you
don't
need
to
rely
on
the--
unknown
speaker
--that's
right.
and...
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
compliance
will
not
be
a
defense
to
the
defendant's
raising
of
an
irrelevant
provision.
unknown
speaker
if
he
raised
a
irrelevant
provision,
preemption
would
be
a
defense.
and
you--
--if
he
raises
an
irrelevant
provision,
compliance
with
that
irrelevant
provision
is
not
a
defense.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
agree
that
if
the
secretary's
policy
were
fairly
read
as
saying
that
10
percent
was
to
be
a
minimum
rather
than
a
maximum,
there
would
be
no
frustration.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
agreed
earlier
that
the
exposure
to
tort
liability
just...
will
just
increase
somewhat
the
rate
of
adoption
of
airbags.
it
will
go
above
the
10
percent.
does
it
have...
say
it
goes
to
15
or
20
percent.
is
that
frustration?
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
not
forced
by
the
regulation,
just
forced
by
what
the
market
forces
that
were
in
place
before
the
regulation
was
adopted.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wheeler.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
would
you
agree
that
she
was
building
in
some
incentive
to
increase
the
number
of
airbags
by
counting
them
one
and
a
half?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
followed
your
brief
all
the
way
through
the
first
24
pages
of
the
argument.
you
get
to
the
point
of
frustration
and
you
argued
on
page
25
that
if
you
allow
the
potential
tort
liability
to
remain
and
not
be
preempted,
it
would
likely
have
let
all
the
companies
to
install
airbags
in
all
cars.
that
was
your...
and
it
had
not
done
that
in
the...
in
the
preceding
period.
so,
that
is
really
a
straw
man,
is
it
not,
because
there
really
was
no
likelihood
that
that
particular
eventuality
would
come
to
pass?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
argue
that
it
would
be
a
frustration
of
policy
if
they
installed
them
in
20
percent
instead
of
10
percent.
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
correct
in
saying
that
your...
the
argument
in
your
brief
was
the
frustration
would
be
that
it
would
lead
to
100
percent
airbags?
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
sticking
to
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
the
problem
i
have
with
your
implied
preemption
argument
is...
is
simply
that
i
don't...
i
don't
feel
free
to
find
an
implication
of
preemption
when
i
am...
when
i
am
confronted
flat
in
the
face
with
a
provision
which
says
that
compliance
with
any
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
issued
under
this
subchapter
does
not
exempt
any
person
from
liability
under
common
law.
if
that
means
what
your
opponent
says
it
means,
i
don't
think
we're
free
to
speculate
about
what
implied
preemption
there
must
be.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
that
provision
to...
to
preserve
that.
you
would
only
need
that
provision
to
preserve
a
common
law
claim
that's
based
upon
the
same
thing
that
has
been
complied
with.
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
a
standard
for
an
airbag,
if...
if
it
said
the
airbag
has
to
be
so
many
inches
thick
or
whatnot--
unknown
speaker
--if
there
wasn't
any
and
all...
all
it
says
is
you
have
to
have
airbags,
no
one
would
have
thought
that...
that
you
needed
this
provision
to
be
sure
that...
that
you
could
sue
for
a
defective
airbag.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
bryant,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
