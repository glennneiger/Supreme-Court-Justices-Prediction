but
in
rosenman--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is...
was
there
at
the
time
of
rosenman--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
the
time,
did
the
statute
specifically
say...
the
language
that
we
have...
that
an
amount
paid
as
an
estimated
tax
shall
be
deemed
to
have
been
paid
on
such
and
such
a
date?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
we
have
a
new
section
and
we
have
also
the
point
justice
scalia
made.
and
i
wondered
as
well
in
rosenman,
although
frankfurter
did
use
the
word
estimated
taxes,
i
don't
know
that
the
payor
thought
of
it
that
way
because
the
payor
said
this
payment
is
made
under
protest
and
duress,
just
to
avoid
penalties
and
interest,
since
it
is
contended
by
the
executors
that
not
all
of
this
sum
is
legally
or
lawfully
due.
and
so,
one
might
say
given
that
they
didn't
think
they
owed
it,
it
wasn't
the
payment
of
an
estimated
tax.
but
here
it
is
an
effort
to
pay
an
estimated
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
is
it
supposed
to
work
if
some
taxpayer
doesn't
know
that
much
about
it,
is
in
some
complicated
situation?
he
files
his
return
all
right,
but
he
isn't
certainly
about
something.
so,
he
sends
in
a
check
for
10,000
dollars
and
just
says,
gee,
i...
i
don't
have
a
clue
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
here.
here
are
all
the
facts
and
sets
them
all
out.
and
he
never
hears
from
anybody
for
5
years
or
so.
and
finally,
after
about
5
years,
he
gets
back
a
letter,
oh,
you
don't
owe
anything.
and...
and
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
just...
you
know,
he
gets
his
tax...
a
very
honest
person.
he
sends
it
in.
he
says,
i
couldn't
owe
more
than
this.
i...
i'm
sure
i
don't
owe
more
than
10,000
dollars.
help.
i
don't...
can't...
i...
i
never
go
near
lawyers.
[laughter]
i
expect
you
to
help
me.
just,
please,
tell
me
what
i
owe.
i'll
pay
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
he
didn't
because
he
never
heard
from
anybody
for
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
other
words,
suppose
5
years
goes
by.
he
never
hears
a
word.
he
sent
in
the
10,000
dollars,
and
then
he
gets
a
letter
5
years
later,
you
didn't
owe
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
out
of
luck.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
simply
pointing
out
it...
it
could
be
a
really
honest
mistake
situation.
the
taxpayer
has
done
everything
possible,
and
perhaps
the
irs
is
at
fault
if
they
don't
respond
promptly.
now,
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
there's
just
no
remedy,
and
i
wonder
if
there...
there
is
any.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
did
in
my
hypothetical.
he
did.
