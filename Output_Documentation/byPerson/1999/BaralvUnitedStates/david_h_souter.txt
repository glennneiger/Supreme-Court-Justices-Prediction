--well,
you
might
also
say
that
the
taxpayer
has
not
done
everything
he
could
possible.

he's
supposed
to
file...
he's
supposed
to
file
a
return.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
did
the
suspense
account
apply
only
to
estate
taxes
or
to
income
tax
payments?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it
would
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
given
the
i
think
the
tax
payment
act
of
1943,
what's
your
authority
to
accept
the
deposit
anymore
under...
under
your
revenue
procedure?
justice
david

souter
mr.
jones,
i
just
was
going
to...
i
understand
your
argument.
i
understand
also
that
his
counter-argument
isn't
necessarily
controlling
with
regard
to
what
you
say.
but
it,
nevertheless,
is
true,
i
think,
that
his
reading
of...
of
6513(b)(2)
would
at
least
serve
the
function
of
preventing
the
government
being
used
as
a
bank
by
somebody
who
wanted
to
overpay
his
estimated
payments.
