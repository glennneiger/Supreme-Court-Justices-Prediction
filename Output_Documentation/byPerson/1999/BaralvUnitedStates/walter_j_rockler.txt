mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
claim
for
overpayment
of
income
tax
for
the
calendar
year
1988.
there
is
no
question
of
the
overpayment.
it
occurred
and
is
acknowledged.
the
taxpayer's
claim
was
filed
june
1,
1993
on
mr.
baral's
income
tax
return
which
was
filed
late.
nevertheless,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
claim
of
overpayment
was
timely
for
code
section
6511(a)
purposes.
the
question
of
a
limitations
bar
to
recovery
arises
under
code
section
6511(b),
which
provides
that
only
payment
of
tax
sought
to
be
refunded,
made
within
3
years
before
the
claim,
may
be
recovered.
it's
3
years
plus
any
extension
of
time
granted
to
file
a
return.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
4
months
in
this
case,
yes.
if
the
starting
date
for
limitations...
if
the
starting
date
for
limitations
is
april
15,
1989,
the
payments
could
not
be
recovered.
the
starting
date
is
june
1,
1993.
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
apply.
the
limitations
period
under
section
6511(b)
starts
running
from
the
date
of
payment
of
the
income
tax,
not
from
the
date
that
income
tax
liability
arose
or
accrued.
in
the
government's
view
and
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
payment
of
income
tax
was
made
april
15,
1989,
the
income
tax
return
due
date,
although
on
that
date,
the
amount
of
income
tax
liability
had
not
been
determined
and
was
not
known
by
anyone.
the
government
and
the
court
below
assert
that
section
6513(b)...
(b)(1)
and
(2)...
makes
the
return
due
date
the
starting
date
for
limitations,
quote,
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
other
words,
they
assert
that
deemed
due
date
of
the
return
was
the
date
of
payment
of
the
income
tax.
in
our
view
this
is
a
misreading
of
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
the...
the
deemed
date,
the
date
of
the
return
being
due,
is
the
date
to
which
withholding
taxes
and
estimated
taxes
are
brought
forward
instead
of
their
actual
payment
dates
which
occurred
during
the
calendar
year.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
i
don't
think
the...
i
don't
think
the
section
says
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
it's
a...
if
i
may
refer
to
the
section
itself.
that
is
section
6513(b)(2).
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
it's
at
the
end
of
both
briefs.
in
our
principal
brief,
it's
at
page
a-12,
appendix
page
12.
that
says,
any
amount
paid
as
estimated
income
tax
for
any
taxable
year...
i
repeat
estimated
income
tax...
shall
be
deemed
to
have
been
paid
on
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
the
return
under
section
6012
for
such
taxable
year,
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension.
the
deemed
date
is
the
date
of
payment
of
the
estimated
tax.
now,
the
court
in
considering
this,
at
least
those
courts
that
have
been
adverse
to
our
position,
have
without
any
focus
simply
assumed
that
the
deemed
date
of
payment
of
the
estimated
tax
is
the
deemed
date
for
payment
of
the
income
tax.
and
those
are
two
totally
different
things.
an
estimate
is
just
what
it
claims
to
be.
if
i
may
digress
for
a
moment
and
refer
to
the
rosenman
case,
which
has
been
featured
heavily
in
the
briefs
here.
in
that
case,
the
remittance
was--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--no,
no.
there...
if
i
may
say
so,
justice
stevens,
the
statute
which
originally
brought
this
into
the
code,
the
1943
tax
act,
made
the
point
that
the
deemed
date
was
the
deemed
date,
but
not
earlier
than
the
deemed
date.
in
other
words,
that
phrase
appeared.
it
got
dropped
in
the
'54
code.
but
the
significance
i
think
is
that
you
have
cases
not
unusual
at
all,
where
taxpayers
file
a
return
early
between
december
31
and
the
due
date
of
the
return,
and
the...
that...
that
filing
of
a
return
and
bringing
across
the
credits
for
withholding
and
estimated
taxes
against
the
income
tax
would
start
the
statute
of
limitations
running
before
the
return
date.
it
also
would
start
interest
running
before
the
return
date.
and
i
think
the
real
function
was
to
limit
the
application
of
the
statute
to
not
earlier
than
a
return
filed
on
the
due
date--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--and
to...
and
to
limit
the
payment
of
interest
to
that
date.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
as
to
the
caption,
first,
i
think
that
is
a...
a
secondary
or
tertiary
form
of
reading
the...
the
statute.
i
think
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
are
of
more
consequence.
but
the
word
prepaid
income
tax
can
also
be
viewed
as
a
synonym
for
advanced
payment
of
income
tax,
in
other
words,
can
refer
to
a
credit
situation.
let
me
refer
the
court
to
section
6611
of
the
code,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
it
makes
plain
in
two
sections
on
interest--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--i
think
it's
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
it
is
cited.
i'm
not
sure
it's
reproduced
in
the
briefs.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
regret,
your
honor...
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
don't
think
it
is
in
the
briefs.
but
that
has
two
subsections,
one
of
which
deals
with
late
return
filing.
it
says,
interest
shall
not
be
paid
until
the
return
is
filed.
then
it
has
another
subsection
entitled
advanced
payments,
withholding
taxes,
and
estimated
taxes,
and
that,
in
effect,
deals
with
early
payments
and
says
interest
won't
be
paid
until
the
due
date
at
the
earliest.
in
effect,
it
repeats
what
was
said
pretty
much
in
the
'43
act.
now,
one
reason
why
we've
referred
to
the
'43
act
is
the
government
has
cited
that
act,
i
think
without
any
great
effect,
as
controlling
with
respect
to
the
purpose
for
which
this
was
adopted.
incidentally,
i
may
say,
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
comments,
that
the
habig
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief...
that's
390
u.s.
at
page
225...
deals
with
section
6513(a).
the
sections
immediately
involved
here
are
6513(b).
but
that
also
has
a
deemed
due
date
as
the
date
for
the
presumable
starting
point
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
makes
it
very
clear
that
that
is
designed
for
the
purposes
which
i
ascribed
to
6513(b),
namely
not
to
start
the
statute
before
the
return
due
date,
not
to
start
interest
payments
before
the
due
date.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
oh,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
directly
on
point
for
this
case.
we...
we
cited
that
case
primarily
for
the
point
that
impossibility
may
override
the
application
of
the
statute.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
criminal
case
and
a
statute
of
limitations
of
6
years.
and
the
question
was,
did
the
statute
start
on
the
return
due
date
or
the
actual
filing
of
the
return?
and
the
court
held
it
had
to
be
the
actual
filing
because
the
offense
was
to
be
found
in
the
return
filed.
how
could
you
have
a
statute
of
limitations
running
before
the
offense
occurred?
similarly,
in
our
situation,
our
position
basically
is,
how
can
you
have
the
payment
of
a
tax
when
nobody
knows
what
it
is?
and
i
might
remind
the
court
that
long
ago
this
court
held
that
to
be
the
governing
principle
here.
that's...
that's
the
rosenman
case,
and
the
rosenman
case
is
very
central
to
your
consideration,
i
think,
of
this
situation.
the
rosenman
case
was
very
close
to
this
case
in
many
respects.
there
the
taxpayer,
a
month
or
so
before
he
filed
a
return,
sent
in
a
letter
saying
that
he
was
paying
an
estimated
tax,
which
is
involved
here
as
well,
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
penalties
and
interest.
and
the
court
said
at
the
time
he
remitted
the
estimate
of
estate
tax
there,
he
couldn't
be
paying
the
estate
tax
because
nobody
knew
what
the
estate
tax
was
at
that
time.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
i
don't
think
the
court
said
it
was
an
express
agreement.
they
said
this
was
an
operating
agreement
whereby
the
taxpayer
paid
in
an
estimate
and
the
government
put
it
in
the
suspense
account.
and
we
have
exactly
the
same
situation.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
record
in
this
case.
there
is
a
certificate
of
assessments
which
shows
that
until
such
time
as
the
return
was
filed
and
assessment
was
made,
the
withholding
taxes
and
the
estimated
taxes
were...
were
held
in
a
suspense
account
as
credits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
code
says
that
withholding
taxes
are
only
credits.
it
doesn't
say
that
they're
the
payment
of
income
taxes.
section
31
of
the
code
says
that
the
withheld
taxes
are
credits
to
be
used
against
the
income
tax.
now,
the
government
has
carefully
avoided
any
discussion
of
the
two
governing
regulations
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
no.
under
the
present
law,
you
get
interest
from
the
date
the
return
is
actually
filed.
that's
6611.
you
don't
get
interest
from
the
return
due
date.
that
just
isn't
so.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i...
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
taxpayers
have
no
incentive
to
delay
the
filing
of
their
returns.
there
is
no
real
risk
of
that,
as
we
pointed
out,
particularly
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
if
they've
overpaid,
they
are
losing
interest
for
whatever
period
of
late
filing
they're
engaged
in.
if
they've
underpaid,
they're
subject
to
penalties
and
interest
which
continue
to
run
during
the
period
of
delay.
so,
there's
no
incentive
on
the
part
of
taxpayers
to
file
late.
there
are
only
penalties
attached
to
that.
and
there's
no
advantage
in
litigation
to
filing
late
because
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
burden
of
coming
forward
is
going
to
be
the
taxpayer's
in
a
refund
suit.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no.
i
think
in
that
case,
on
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
if...
if
there
were
accumulated
withholding
and
estimated
taxes,
as
in
our
case,
there
would
not
be
any
interest
with
respect
to
those
amounts
that
accumulated
as
a
suspense
credit
item.
if
there
were
no
payment
whatever--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--if
there
were
no
payment
whatever
in
any
form,
then
you're
right.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
no.
it's
not
payment.
it's
a
credit.
the...
the
payment
in
the
nature
of
a
deposit,
which
is
what
rosenman
described
the
remittance
as,
does
serve
to
mitigate
against
an
interest
charge
against
the
taxpayer.
he
doesn't
get
any...
he
doesn't
get
any
benefits
for
the
delay
in
filing,
but
he
isn't
penalized
because
the
money
is
there
available
to
the
government
during
that
interval.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
section
6611.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that...
that
is
a
section
which
neither
the
government
nor
the
taxpayer
here
attached
to
the
briefs,
i
regret
to
say.
i
would
like
to
have--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--i...
i
think
you're
quite
correct,
justice
scalia,
in
your
observations
with
respect
to
what
the
case
says.
i
think
justice
frankfurter
made
that
point
very
clearly.
he
said
you
can't
have
payment
for
statute
of
limitations
purpose,
but
not
payment
for
interest
purpose.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
but
the
holding
of
that
case
is
more
basic
than
that
observation.
the
case
really
stands
for
the
proposition...
the
court
made
it
expressly
clear...
that
you
cannot
have
the
payment
of
a
tax
when
you
don't
know
what
the
tax
is.
you
can't
apply
a
credit
to
an
unknown
item.
if
i
prepaid
to
a
department
store
100
dollars
because
i
think
my
wife
is
going
to
run
up
charges,
i
haven't
paid
any...
any
debt
to
the
department
store
until
such
time
as
she
runs
up
the
charges.
if
i'm
a
law
firm
and
i
receive
a
retainer,
which
is
to
be
applied
to
time--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--you
could
say
exactly
the
same
thing
for
the
estate
taxes
in
the
rosenman
case.
you
could
say
when
the
decedent
died,
there
was
a
distinct
tax
liability
immediately.
that
is
not--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--the
position
this
court
took
then.
this
court
said
until
such
time
as
the
tax
is
known
and
asserted.
and
it
could
be
asserted
in
two
ways.
it
could
be
asserted
by
the
taxpayer
filing
a
return
or
self-assessing
himself
in
a
sense.
it
could
be
determined
by
the
government
asserting
an
amount.
they
could
file
a
return
for
him.
that's
an
available
course
for
the
government.
but--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--pardon
me?
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
no.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that...
that
section
was
not
applicable.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
transmittal
letter
of
the
taxpayer,
according
to
the
court,
said
it
was
an
estimate
on
federal
estate
tax.
the
court
i
think
is
referring
to
the
transmittal
letter
as
protesting
and
also
as
trying
to
avoid
penalties
and
interest.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
justice
kennedy,
if
i
may
say
so,
both
withholding
taxes
and
an
estimate
do
nothing
but
give
rise
to
credits,
and
there
are
regulations
in
effect
which
say
these
credits
are
to
be
applied...
future
tense...
when
the
return
is
filed,
and
they
are
set
up
against
the
income
tax
then
known
to
be
due.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
i'm
not
saying
it's
to
no
effect
to
taxpayers
who
are
aware
of
it.
a
revenue
procedure
is
not
widely
disseminated
and
not
viewed
necessarily
as
law.
there's
a
difference
between
a
rev.
proc.
and
a
formally
adopted
treasury
regulation.
if
the
government
wants
that
to
be
the
sole
method
by
which
anybody
could
remit
a
payment
to
be
treated
as
a
credit
or
a
deposit,
then
why
doesn't
it
adopt
a
regulation
which
says
so?
we
have
regulations
in
this
case,
and
the
regulations
are
favorable
to
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
and
you
will
find
a
glaring
omission
of
any
reference
to
those
regulations
in
the
briefs
by
the
government.
i
mean,
those
regulations
provide
that
the
tax
is
paid
on
the
return.
the
overpayment
is
determined
on
the
return,
and
credits
are
applied
on
the
return.
as
to--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--the...
the
voucher
is
a
voucher
for
an
estimated
tax
payment.
it's
an
estimated
tax
form.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the...
the
taxpayer
as
such
is
not
the
ultimate
in
sophistication
on
tax
matters.
when
he
picks
up
a
form
which
says
estimated
tax
voucher,
that's
what
he
thinks
he's
paying,
and
he
certainly
is
paying
an
estimate.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
tax
is
at
that
point.
in
this
particular
case,
as
the
court
well
knows,
the
taxpayer
had
no
records
and
asked
for
them
from
the
government.
ultimately
he
got
them
from
the
government,
but
he
got
them
4
years
later.
until
such
time
as
he
got
the
1099's
which
showed
his
income
receipts,
until
he
got
his
prior
year's
return
which
showed
his
capital
loss,
he
couldn't
file
a
return.
he
was
absolutely
blocked.
now,
he
certainly
wasn't
paying
a
tax
at
that
point.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
no.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no.
i'm...
i'm
not
asserting
that
by
virtue
of
these
facts
he's
equitably
entitled
irrespective
of
the
statute.
i'm
saying
the
statute
doesn't
apply.
the
reason
the
statute
doesn't
apply
is,
to
quote
the
essence
of
rosenman,
he
didn't
know
what
the
tax
was
and
neither
did
the
government.
nobody
knew
what
the
tax
was
at
that
point
on
the
deemed
return
date.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
what's
involved
here
is
a...
is
a
serious
misreading
of
6513(b).
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no.
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
credit
and
a
bill,
a...
a
stated
bill
with
a
specific
amount.
i...
my
point
of
departure
is
this
court's
decision
in
the
rosenman
case.
that
is
what
this
court
said.
it
said
until
such
time
as
you
know
what
the
tax
is,
until
it's
been
asserted,
until
it's
been
specified,
you
can't
be
paying
it.
now,
in
your
credit
case,
it
is
true
you
will
have
on
deposit
with
your
potential
creditor
an
amount,
but
you
haven't
paid
any
bill
at
that
point
because
there
isn't
any
bill,
and
you
don't
pay
an
income
tax
until
you
know
what
it
is.
and
that...
that
is
exactly
what
judge
harlan
in
the
lewyt
case,
which
is
cited
by...
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
said
about
rosenman.
this
is
judge
harlan
who
was
later
justice
harlan,
second
circuit.
and
i'm
quoting
from
215
f.
2d
518,
a
second
circuit
case
at
522-523.
i
quote.
a
remittance
which
does
not
satisfy
an
asserted
tax
liability
should
not
be
treated
as
the
payment
of
the
tax.
that
was
his
conclusion
from
rosenman.
that's
my
conclusion
from
rosenman.
how
can
you
say
that
every
credit
constitutes
a
payment
of
a
future
bill?
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
since
the
case
was
decided
in
'54,
it
must
have
been
the
'39
code.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
now--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--no.
i
don't
think
you
can
view
the
rosenman
case
as
peculiar
to
the
'39
code.
the
language
of
that
case
is
broad
language.
now,
the
government
hasn't--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--the...
the...
that
is
correct,
but
in
the
'54
code,
in
the
legislative
committee
reports
that
accompany
it,
there
was
no
intent
really
to
change
anything
except
the
deemed
due
date
of
returns.
that
was
extended
by
1
month.
under
the
'39
code,
you
had
a
2
and
a
half
month
period
for
filing
returns.
under
the
'54
code,
a
3
and
a
half
month
period.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
that
statute,
there's
no...
no
discussion
whatever
of
the
changes
which
some
draftsman
inserted
there
and
which
i
think
got
by
unnoticed.
there
was
no
intent
to
change
anything
except
the
due
date.
so,
i
don't
think
the
distinction
is
all
that
significant.
moreover,
getting...
getting
back
to
basics,
the
rosenman
case
stands
for
the
broader
proposition,
which
i
have
asserted
here
and
which
i
believe,
namely
you
cannot
pay
a
tax
until
you
know
what
it
is.
you
can
set
up
credits.
and
there's
no
detriment
to
the
federal
revenue
or
the
revenue
system
by
the
position
we're
taking
here.
it's
the
taxpayer
who,
filing
late,
suffers
whatever
penalties
there
are.
the
government
doesn't
suffer
any
penalties.
the
government
doesn't
lose
track
of
taxpayers.
nowadays
we're
in
the
computer
age.
