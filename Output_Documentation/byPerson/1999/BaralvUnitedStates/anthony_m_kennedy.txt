but...
but
as
justice
breyer's
questions
suggest,
we're
living
in
a
post-rosenman
world,
and
after
rosenman,
the
government
made
express
provision
in
its
revenue
procedures
so
that
if
you
paid
a
remittance
as
a
deposit,
you
had
to
expressly
say
it
was
a
deposit.
so,
even
if
rosenberg
were
wholly
in
your
favor,
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
altered
by
the
revenue
rulings
after
that
point
saying
that
you
must
make...
make
it
very
clear
that
this
is
a
deposit.
and
that
wasn't
done
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
then
you're
saying
that
the
revenue
procedure
adopted
in
the
wake
of
rosenman
was
absolutely
to
no
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
rockler
wasn't
overly
impressed
with
your
revenue
procedure,
and
he
says
there's
a
glaring
omission
because
the
regs
don't
pick
this
up.
why
don't
you
have
a
regulation?
that
was
his
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
argument
about
not
using
the
government
as
a
bank...
it
seems
to
me
that's
his
explanation
for
1613(b)(2),
namely
that
you
didn't
want
the...
the
date
the
estimated
payment
was
made
to
serve
as
the
date
to
begin
the
running
of
interest.
so,
that
kind
of
fits
into
his
interpretation
of
the
section.
