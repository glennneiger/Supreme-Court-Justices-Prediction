mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
really
is
a
simple,
straightforward,
textual
answer
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
and
it
only
takes
me
about
a
minute
to
describe
it.
section
6511
of
the
code
limits
the
amount
of
any
refund
to
the
amount
of
taxes
paid
during
the
3
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
refund
claim.
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
when
are
remittances
of
estimated
withholding
taxes
to
be
regarded
as
paid
for
the
specific
purpose
of
the
refund
limitations
in
section
6511,
and
the
introductory
clause
of
section
6513(b)
expressly
and
concisely
answers
that
question,
for
it
says
that
remittances
of
estimated
tax
and
withholding
taxes
shall,
quote,
for
the
purposes
of
section
6511,
be
regarded
as
paid
on
the
date
the
return
is
due.
the
history
of
this
provision
makes
perfectly
clear--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
language
that
i
was
emphasizing
is
up
there
after
prepaid
income
tax
where
it
says,
for
purposes
of
section
6511.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right,
and
6512
is
the
statute
of
limitations
in
tax
court
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
then
i
was
summarizing
the
rest
of
the
text.
(b)(1)
says
that
you...
that
you
use
the...
for
withholding
taxes,
you
treat
those
as
paid
on
the
date
of
the...
that
a
return
is
due,
and
then
(b)(2)
says
that
for
estimated
taxes,
you
treat
those
on
the
date
the
return
is
due...
as
paid
on
the
date
the
return
is
due.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
both
of
which
are
involved
in
this
case
because
we
have
in
this
case
both
withholding
and
estimated
taxes,
and
so
both
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
apply
here.
and
under
both
of
those
provisions,
congress
said
that
for
purposes
of
the
refund
limitations
in
section
6511,
these
kinds
of
payments
are
to
be
regarded
as
made...
paid
on
the
date
the
return
is
due.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
and
that
should
be
on
the
prior
page.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
the
particular
part
involved
here
is
6511(b)(2)(a),
which
begins
to
be
quoted
on
appendix
a-11
of
the
blue
brief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
specific
language
would
be
in
the...
if
the
claim
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer
during
the
3-year
period
following
the
filing
of
the
return,
and
that
references
us
back
up
to
6511(a).
but
if
you
filed
within
the
3-year
period
filing...
following
the
return,
then
the
amount
that
the...
the
amount
of
the
credit
or
refund
shall
not
exceed
the
portion
of
the
tax
paid
within
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
filing
of
the
claim
equal
to
3
years
plus
the
period
of
any
extension.
and
so,
i
was
summarizing
this
provision
when
i
said
that
in...
6511(b)(2)(a)
limits
the
amount
of
the
refund
or
the
taxes
paid
within
the
period
of
3
years
of...
of
the
refund
claim.
and
then
you
look
to
6513(b)
which
says
for
purposes
of
that
section,
withholding
and
estimated
taxes
are
to
be
regarded
as
paid
on
the
date
the
return
is
due.
the
legislative
history
of
this
is
perfectly
clear.
we've
cited
it
in
our
brief.
when
congress
enacted
these
interrelated
provisions,
it
did
so
for
the
very
purpose
of
answering
the
question
in
this
case,
and
it
says
that
these
payments
are
to
be
regarded
as
paid
for
purposes
of
the
refund
limitations
on
the
date
the
returns
are...
are
due.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
only
thing
that
he...
he
cites
in
the
regulations
are
simply
provisions
that
direct
taxpayers
as
a
general
matter
to
make
their
refund
claim
on
their
return.
if
they've
made
an
overpayment...
as
we
all
know,
the
last
line
on
the
return
is
you
put
in
the
overpayment.
that
satisfies
the
regulatory
refund--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
this
is
a
procedural
rule,
so
i
mean,
it
is
a
regulation
in
the...
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
term.
it
is
a
rule
adopted
by
the
service
to
govern
this
procedural
aspect
of
its
work.
it's
not
a
substantive
regulation
like
a
treasury
regulation
that
might
interpret
some
substantive
provision
of
the
code,
but
it
sets
out
procedures
that
the
service
will
follow
in
accepting
deposits.
and...
and
i
should
emphasize
that...
maybe
out
of
context,
but
the
reason
why
we
accept
deposits
is
not
discussed
in
any
of
these
cases
and
it's
kind
of
obscure.
the
only
reason
why
a
taxpayer
would
ever
want
to
make
a
deposit
would
be
because
he
wanted
to
preserve
his
opportunity
of
going
to
tax
court.
if
he
pays
the
tax,
then
there
would
be
no
deficiency
to
be
noticed,
and
therefore
no
way
for
him
to
go
into
tax
court
to
review
the
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
he...
oh,
you
mean
that
he
didn't
even
owe
the
10,000
dollars.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that
would
certainly
be
an
unfortunate
situation.
[laughter]
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
think
of
a
situation
like
that
ever
happening,
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--to
try
to
parse
through
the...
the
hypothetical,
if...
if
he
made
it
as
a
payment,
which
i
assume
he
did
because
he
didn't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
can
answer
your
question.
he
made
a
payment.
he
made
a
payment
that
was
applied
against
his
taxes.
if
he
didn't
need
to
make
the
payment,
he
made
an
overpayment.
if
he
made
an
overpayment,
he
should
have
filed
a
refund
request
in
a
timely
manner.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
it
was
he
needed
to
hear
from
us
because--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--all
taxpayers
are
on
notice
of
the
law,
and
the
law
in
this
respect
says--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--on
the
bare
facts
that
you
described,
yes,
he's
out
of
luck.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
mean,
that's
why
there
are
statutes
of
limitations
that
are
designed
to
cut
off
stale
claims.
you've
described
what
is
a
stale
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
whole
concept
of...
of
petitioner's
position
is
alien
to
our
system
of
taxation.
he
says
you
can't
pay
a
tax
until
it's
been
assessed.
we
have
a
system
of
self-assessment.
taxpayers
are
supposed
to
figure
out
their
own
tax
liability
and
are
supposed
to
pay
it
with
the
return
at
the
time
the
return
is
due.
section
6151
of
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
he
should
still
file
a
return
even
if
he
doesn't
owe
us
money
because,
i
mean,
both
as
a
matter
of
exposing
himself
to
penalties,
but
beyond
that,
i
mean,
we
can't
know...
we
can't
go
out
and
investigate
everybody
without
any
record.
we
need
a
return
to...
at
least
as
a
point
of
departure,
to
figure
out
people's
liabilities.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
people
need
to
be
diligent
in
protecting
their
rights.
i...
i
don't
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
he's
supposed
to
file
a
return,
and
he's
supposed
to
file
a
refund
claim.
and...
and
in
your
hypothetical,
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
law--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--his
failure
to
comply
with
the
law
means
that
he's
not
entitled
to
a
refund.
the...
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
of
this
case
in...
in
a
one-page
opinion,
and
frankly,
that...
that
was
not
an
unrealistic
approach
because
the
text
of
the
statute
is
clear.
congress
plainly
has
it
within
their
right
to
deem
what
is
paid
for
purposes
of
the
limitations
period,
and
they
quite
clearly
did
so
and
quite
clearly
intended
to
do
so.
now,
what
petitioner
says
is,
well,
his
only
textual
argument
is
that,
well,
these
are
payments
of
estimated
taxes
and
withholding
taxes
and
that's
somehow
different
from
income
taxes.
and...
and
that's
plainly
not
correct.
as...
as
has
already
been
pointed
out,
the
title
of...
of
this
provision,
when
congress
enacted
it,
is
prepaid
income
taxes.
and
section
6315
of
the
code
specifically
describes
estimated
tax
payments
as
payments
on
account
of
the
income
tax.
and
section
6401(b)
specifically
says
that
if
you
have
withholding...
withholding
credits,
the
only
way...
that
are
applied
against
your
income
tax,
the
only
way
you
can
recover
them
is
if
they
have
resulted
in
an
overpayment
of
your
income
tax.
and
the
only
way
you
can
recover
them
is
if
you
file
a
timely
claim
under
6511
for
recovery
of
an
overpayment
of
income
tax.
congress
really
worked
pretty
hard
to
make
all
these
provisions
work
together,
and
they
really
do
when
you
carefully
pull
them
apart
and
look
at
how
they
work.
the...
setting
aside
the
text
of
the
statute,
petitioner
then
says,
well,
just
as
a
matter
of
logic,
you
can't
pay
a
tax
before
it's
actually
been
finally
determined
and
assessed.
well,
we're
supposed
to
self-assess.
we're
not
supposed
to
wait
for
the
service
to
tell
us
what
our
obligations
are.
in
the
manning
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
on
the
date
the
return
is
due,
under
section
6151
of
the
code,
every
taxpayer
has
a
positive
obligation
to
pay
his
tax
without,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
an
actual
assessment
of
it.
an
assessment
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
liability.
an
assessment...
interest
accrues
on
a
liability
without
assessment.
the
united
states
may
bring
a
suit
to
enforce
a
tax
liability
without
assessment.
an
assessment
is
simply,
in
the
words
of
the
code,
an
administrative
record
of
the
liability.
it
is
an
administrative
determination
which,
when
made,
authorizes
additional
enforcement
devices
such
as
liens
and
levies,
and
it
gives
us
an
additional
10
years
to
collect
the
tax.
but
it's
not
a
prerequisite
to
liability,
and...
and
payments
are
routinely
to
be
made
before
the
tax
is
assessed
under
the
code.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
rosenman
really
addressed
a
completely
different
subject.
first
of
all,
let
me
point
out,
as
i
begin
discussing
rosenman,
that
it
did
not
address
or
consider
the
provisions
at
issue
here,
and
so
it
doesn't
consider
and
certainly
doesn't
override
the
clear
textual
determination
that
these
types
of
remittances
are
paid
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
date
the
return
is
due.
what
rosenman
dealt
with
was
something
entirely
different,
an
administrative
practice
that
congress
has
repudiated
and
that
no
longer
applies.
in
rosenman,
before
the
case
arose,
the
service
had
long
taken
the
position
that
a
remittance
of
tax
from
a
taxpayer
who
in
fact
owed
no
liability
would
not
be
treated
as
a
payment
of
tax
but
would
be
held
in
a
suspense
account
on
which
no
interest
would
accrue.
the
reason
the
service
had
done
this
back
in
the
'20's
and
'30's
was
because
of
a
concern
they
had
about
a
potential
abuse.
the
potential
abuse
related
to
the
fact
that
overpayment
interest
is
more
than
the
interest
on
ordinary
federal
funds.
right
now
it's
3
percent
over
the
short-term
federal
funds
rate.
the
service
didn't
want
the
treasury
to
be
used
as
a
bank
that
would
allow
taxpayers
to
simply...
in
the
words
of
the
congress
that
discussed
this,
to
simply
throw
the
money
at
the
service
and
go...
and
collect
this
higher
rate
of
interest.
so,
to
prevent
the
abuse,
the
service
had
a
prophylactic
approach
of
saying
all
of
these
payments
from
taxpayers
who
don't
owe
us
anything
we're
going
to
put
in
a
suspense
account.
now,
what
the
court
said
in
rosenman
was,
well,
if
you
treat
these
matters
as
non-payment--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
had
no...
no
way
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
service
had
nothing
in
their
records
to
indicate
what
the
liability
would
be
for
the
taxpayer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
yes.
the
taxpayer
might
have
owed
money,
but
if
from
the
service's
perspective...
this
broad,
prophylactic
approach
was,
if
from
the
service's
perspective
there
was
no
indication
of
what
that
liability
was,
they'd
just
suspense
it.
they
didn't
want
to...
they
didn't
want
to
be
used
as
a
bank.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
this...
this
was
generally
applied
to
other
types.
my
assumption
is
it
was
to
any
type
of
tax
obligation
for
which
overpayment
interest
would
have
been
available,
which
would--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
because
as
i
will
explain
to
you
next,
congress
repudiated
the
service's
practice
in
the...
in
the
current
tax
payment
act
of
1943.
in
section
4(d)
of
that
act,
congress
said
basically
stop
treating
these
matters
as
deposits.
treat
it
as
a
payment
even
if
the
taxpayer
has
no
liability.
in
the
legislative
report
on
that
bill
at
page
28
i
think...
it
might
be
48,
but
i
think
28...
the...
the
congress
discusses
this
and
says
the
service
has
overreacted
to
this
potential
abuse.
we
don't
think
it's
that
big
a
problem.
but
there
might
be
a
problem
if
some
taxpayer
threw
money
on
the
treasury
when
they
really
did
not,
in
good
faith,
have
any
belief
that
they
had
a
liability.
and
so,
congress
worded
this
provision
very
carefully.
it's
section
4(d)
of
the...
of
that
act.
it's
now
section
6401(c)
of
the
code.
and
what
it
says
is
that
a
payment
shall
not
be
treated
not
as
an
overpayment
merely
because
the
taxpayer
had
no
liability.
that
protected
the
service's
right
to
say
in
a
particular
case,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
overpayment
interest
even
though
it's
a
payment.
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
overpayment
interest
because
it's
not
a
good
faith
overpayment.
you
were
throwing
money
at
me.
but
as
the
united
states
said
in
its
brief
in
the
rosenman
case,
on
the
last
two
pages
of
its
brief
in
the
rosenman
case,
under
that
new
statute
the
payment
transmitted
in
rosenman
would
have
been
treated
as
a
payment.
it
was
treated
as
a
payment
on
which
overpayment
interest
would
accrue.
and,
indeed,
the
strange
argument
the
united
states
made
in
the
rosenman
case
was
that
the
legislative
determination
that
that
was
to
be
treated
as
a
payment
for
purposes
of
overpayment
interest
somehow
resolved
an
uncertainty
that
had
existed
in
the
past
about
whether
those
kinds
of
payments
would
be
held
as
suspense
or
as
payments
for
purposes
of
the
limitations
provisions.
well,
the
court,
to
be
blunt,
would
have
none
of
that.
in
the
rosenman
case,
the
court
said
it
will
not
do
to
treat
these
funds
as
a
payment
or
not
as
a
payment
depending
on
whether
the
government
wins
or
loses.
and
because
the
government
treated...
at
the
time
of
the
rosenman
case
arose
treated
it
as
a
deposit
and
not
as
a
payment,
that's...
that's
the
way
it
should
be
treated.
now,
after
rosenman,
after
the
new
section
4(d)
of
the
current
tax
payment
act,
those
types
of
remittances
are
not
held
in
special
suspense
accounts,
are
not
held
in
deposits.
the
only
way
we
accept
a
deposit
now
is
under
the
revenue
procedure.
and
under
the
revenue
procedure,
it
is
generally
required
that
the
taxpayer
specifically
designate
at
the
time
of
the
remittance
that
he
is
making
a
deposit
and
not
a
payment,
and
that
protects
everybody
and
everybody
knows
what's
happening.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
suppose
it's...
it
was
not
statutory.
it's
consent.
it's
contractual.
if
the...
if
the
taxpayer
wants
to...
wants
to
reserve
his
right
to
get
to
tax
court
and
make
his
deposit
instead
of
making
the
payment,
we
can
agree
to
that.
we
can't
compel
it.
we
can't,
under...
under
the
current
tax
payment
act,
we
can't
compel
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
tax
payment
act
sets
the
rule,
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
situation
that
where
the
parties
can
vary
it
by
agreement.
i
don't...
i
don't
know
of
a
reason
why
we
couldn't,
although
i
have
to
confess
it
isn't
perfectly
clear
to
me
why
the
service
is
willing
to
participate
in
these
types
of
agreements,
but
i
think
it's
a
historical
thing.
and
there
may
be
one
explanation.
congress
has
provided
that
a
payment
of
a
tax
made
after
the
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
issued
and
the...
and
the
tax
court
case
has
begun
that
if
you
pay
it
after
you've
begun
the
tax
court
case,
then
you
don't
divest
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
it's
only
if
you
pay
it
before
the
case
has
begun
that
you
do.
and
so,
these
deposit
agreements
allow
the
taxpayer
to...
to
get
into
tax
court
even
by
curtailing
the
interest
before
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
consistent
with
that
goal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
certainly
doesn't
replace
it,
i
mean.
the...
the
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
say
about
the
revenue
procedure,
which
our
brief
doesn't
address,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
there's
no
confusion.
in
paragraph
4.04
of
the
revenue
procedure,
if
a
taxpayer
makes
a
remittance
at
a
time
when
there's
no
identified
liability
and
we
don't
know
how
to
apply
it...
he
doesn't
designate
the
year
or
the
tax
to
which
the
remittance
would
apply...
we
will
temporarily
treat
it
as
a
deposit.
we
will
promptly
notify
the
taxpayer
of
this
and
request
him
to
tell
us
how
he
wants
us
to
designate
it.
and
so,
in
that
one
brief
instance,
there
can
be
a
deposit
without
an
express
designation.
there
is
a...
a
broad
point
that
i
want
to
mention,
and
that
is
if
petitioner's
argument
were
accepted,
it
would
seriously
disadvantage
the
vast
majority
of
taxpayers
who
pay
timely,
who
file
timely
returns,
and
who
file
timely
claims
for
refund.
and
that
is
because
on
petitioner's
theory,
payments
of
estimated
taxes,
of
withholding,
payments
made
with...
with
the
return,
and
any
payment
made
before
the
tax
is
assessed
would
simply
be
a
deposit
and
would
not
be
a
payment
on
which
overpayment
interest
would
run.
since
under
the
code,
the
service
can
take
3
years
after
the
return
is
filed
to
make
an
assessment,
petitioner's
theory
would
mean
that
these
taxpayers
would
lose
their
overpayment
interest
for
that
3-year
period.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i...
i
didn't
understand
his
answer,
and
i
don't
agree
with
it.
the
overpayment
interest
runs...
oh,
i...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
rockler
was
making
the...
the
point
that...
that
overpayment
interest
doesn't
begin
to
run
from
the
date
of
the
return
if
you
file
a
late
return.
i
didn't
hear
him
to
be
making
any
other
contention
on
that
issue.
from
the
date...
even
if
you
filed...
even
in
mr.
rockler's
situation,
if
you
file
a
late
return,
you
get...
the
service
could
still
have
3
years
to
assess,
and
his
taxpayer
would
lose
3
years
of
interest
even
if...
even
from
that
overpayment...
i
mean,
even
from
that
special
date
that
the
interest
begins
to
run.
for
interest
to
run
on
an
overpayment,
there
has
to
be
an
overpayment.
there
can't
be
an
overpayment
if
there's
not
a
payment.
his
theory
it's
a
deposit,
not
a
payment.
so,
all...
all
the...
i
think
in
the
brockamp
case,
the
court
noted
that
something
like
90
million
refunds
are
given
every
year.
most
of
those
are
people
who
pay
their
taxes
through
withholding,
through
estimated
taxes,
or
with
their
return.
and
none
of
those
taxpayers
would
get
overpayment
interest
under
this
theory.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
pardon
me?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it's
always
in
our
interest
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
always
in
our
interest
to
try
to
do
what
congress
intended,
and
i
don't
say
that
in
anything
other
than
in...
in
full
meaning.
i
mean,
our
job
is
simply
to
accomplish
what
congress
indicated
we
should
accomplish
and...
and
we're
pointing
out
that
what
his...
what
mr.
rockler's
position
would
result
in
would
be
a
drastic
difference
from
what
congress
intended,
both
in
terms
of
determining
when
the...
when
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
and
in
determining
when
overpayment
interest
accrues.
if...
are
there
questions?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
i'm
finished.
