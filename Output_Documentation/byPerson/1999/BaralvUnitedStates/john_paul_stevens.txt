justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
rockler,
for
just
a
second?
why
would
the
congress
want
to
draw
a
distinction?
what
is
the
significance
of
deeming
a
date
for
the
payment
of
the
estimated
tax
other
than
to
establish
the
date
of
payment
of
the
tax
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
hypothetical
precisely
the
same
as
this
case?
