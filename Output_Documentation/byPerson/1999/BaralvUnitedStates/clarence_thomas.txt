justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
petitioner
baral
is
a
taxpayer.
in
1988,
petitioner’s
employer
withheld
a
portion
of
petitioner’s
wages
and
remitted
it
to
the
internal
revenue
service
toward
petitioner’s
tax
liability
for
the
tax
year
1988.
petitioner
remitted
an
additional
amount
to
the
irs
as
estimated
income
tax.
although,
petitioner
obtained
an
extension
of
time
for
filing
his
tax
return
until
august
15,
1989,
he
missed
his
deadline
and
did
not
file
the
return
until
june
1,
1993.
on
this
return,
he
claimed
that
the
two
remittances
exceeded
his
tax
liability
for
the
1988
tax
year
and
requested
a
credit
toward
his
1989
tax
liability.
the
irs
denied
the
requested
credit
concluding
that
petitioner’s
claim
exceeded
the
ceiling
imposed
by
internal
revenue
code
section
6511(b)
which
limits
the
amount
of
credit
or
refund
of
overpaid
tax
to
the
portion
of
the
overpaid
tax
that
was
paid
within
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
filing
of
the
claim
equal
to
three
years
plus
any
extension
of
time.
here
that
period
began
on
february
1,
1990
and
ended
on
june
1,
1993.
the
irs
determined
that
the
two
remittances
have
been
paid
on
april
15,
1989,
that
is
before
and
outside
the
period
described
by
section
6511(b).
petitioner
then
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
which
ruled
in
favor
of
the
irs.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
explaining
that
code
section
6513
plainly
establishes
that
remittances
of
a
holding
tax
and
estimated
income
tax
are
deemed
paid
for
the
purpose
of
section
6511
on
the
due
date
of
the
taxpayer’s
return
for
the
relevant
year.
here
that
due
date
was
april
15,
1989.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
that
court
observe
section
6513
plainly
indicates
that
the
remittances
at
issue
here
are
considered
paid
on
april
15,
1989
so
that
they
fall
outside
the
period
described
by
section
6511.
because
neither
these
nor
any
other
remittances
towards
the
overpaid
tax
was
paid
within
the
relevant
period,
the
ceiling
on
petitioner’s
credit
or
refund
is
zero
and
the
irs
was
correct
to
deny
the
requested
credit.
we
reject
petitioner’s
contention
that
section
6513
indicates
only
when
remittances
of
withholding
tax
or
estimated
income
tax
are
deemed
paid
and
that
section
6513
says
nothing
about
when
income
tax
was
paid.
this
contention
rests
on
the
mistaken
premise
that
the
withholding
tax
and
the
estimated
income
tax
are
taxes
in
their
own
right,
separate
from
the
income
tax;
they
are
instead
methods
for
collecting
the
income
tax.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
