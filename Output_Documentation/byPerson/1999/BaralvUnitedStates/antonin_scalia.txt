justice

mr.
rockler,
before
you...
before
you
get
off
rosenman,
there
was...
there
was
another
feature
in
that
case
which...
which
no
longer
exists
and
is...
is
not
a
factor
in
the
present
case,
and
that
is
the
government
there
was...
was
trying
to
have
its
cake
and
eat
it
too.
it
was
asserting
that
for
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitation,
the...
the
filing...
the
filed
date
was
determinative,
but...
but
that
no...
but
that
interest
would...
would...
well,
let's
see.
no.
it
was
asserting
that
for
purposes
of...
of
the
statute
of
limitation,
the
date
on
which
it
should
have
been
filed
was
determinative,
but
that
for
purposes
of
whether
interest
runs,
the
date
of
actual
filing
was
determinative
so
that
you
would
not
get
any
interest
on
the
prepayment
until
the
return
was
actually
filed.
now,
that
feature
of
the
law
has
since
been
changed
by...
by
statutory
amendment
so
that
you
will
get
interest
from
the
date
that
the...
at
least
from
the
return
due
date.
justice
antonin
scalia
let...
let
me
come
back
to...
to
rosenman.
you're
quite
right.
the...
the
issue
in
the
case
was
not
an
issue
of
timing,
but
it
was
an
issue
of
whether...
whether
the...
the
prepayment
was
a
prepayment
of
taxes.
if
it
was
a
prepayment
of
taxes,
interest
would
be
due.
if
it
was
only
a
deposit,
interest
would
not
be
due.
and
the
government
was
claiming
that
interest
was
not
due
because
it
was
not
a
prepayment
of
taxes
for
that
purpose,
but
that
it
was
a
prepayment
of
taxes
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitation.
it
was
taking
an
inconsistent
position
on
that
issue.
now,
that
is
not
the
situation
here
because
the
statute
now
makes
it
clear
that
even
if
it
is
not
a
prepayment
of
taxes,
even
if
it
is
just...
whatever
it
is,
interest
runs
on
it,
on
the
overpayment
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
don't
have
that
problem
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
charges
have
been
run
up
here.
i
mean,
you're
liable
for
the
tax
not
by
reason
of
your
filing
the
return.
you're
liable
for
it
by
reason
of
your
breathing
in
and
out
for
a
year--
[laughter]
and...
and
getting
some
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rockler--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
rockler,
you
seem
to
be
making
a
sort
of
a...
i
don't
know...
a
philosophical
argument
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
prepayment
on
a
debt
unless
the
precise
amount
of
the
debt
is...
is
known,
and...
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
true.
let's...
let's
assume
i'm
leaving
on...
i'm
going
to
be
out
of
the
country
for
2
months
and...
and
i
know
that
i
have
run
up
credit
card
charges,
and
that
when
the
credit
card
bill
comes,
i
won't
be
here
to
pay
it,
and
so
i'll
be
charged
interest
later.
even
though
i
don't
know
the...
the
precise
amount
of
my
indebtedness,
i
know
that
i
am
indebted
to
the
credit
company.
i
could
write
a
check
and
mail
it
off
to
them
in
advance
of
their
submitting
to
me
the
precise
bill
for...
for
the
last
month,
and
that
would
be
a
perfectly
valid
prepayment
of
my
debt.
payment
of
my
debt
in
advance
of
the
date
on
which
they
assess
me.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
what
happens
here.
there's
no...
there...
there's
no
philosophical
objection
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
a
self-assessment
system.
this
is
a
taxpayer
who
simply
doesn't
want
to...
doesn't
want
to
self-assess.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
guess
you're
not
allowed
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
worth
10,000
dollars
not
to
have
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
agree--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on
any
further,
how
did
they
know
that
the
taxpayer
didn't
owe
them
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
until
there's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
so,
it...
the
taxpayer
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
come
you're
here
on
this
side
of
the
case?
it
raises
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say
it...
it
would
seem
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
government
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
this
case.
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i've
never
seen
this
happen
before.
