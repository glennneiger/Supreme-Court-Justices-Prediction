chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
98-1667,
david
baral
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
rockler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
will
we
find
that,
mr.
rockler,
in
the
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
will
we
find
this,
mr.
rockler?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
going
to
rely
on
it,
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
reproduce
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
rosenman
too,
mr.
rockler,
involved
a
rather
express
agreement
by
the
government,
did
it
not,
to
kind
of
hold
this
in
escrow?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
court
said
that
in
its
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what...
you
say
that
quite
confidently,
but
what
statutory
provision
is
it
that
says
interest
will
run
or
not
run
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
don't
cite
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rockler.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
quite
the
way
the...
the...
at
least
the
version
of
6513(b)(2)
that
i
have
before
me
reads,
where
it
says...
would
you...
would
you
read
the
exact
language
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ah,
or
6512.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
and
then...
then...
so,
from
there
you
dropped
down
to
the
text
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
(1)
and
(2)
distinguish
between
two
different
situations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you
also
said
6511--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
your
1-minute
summary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what...
what
part
of
section
6511?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
and
what...
point
to
the
specific
language--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
tax
payment
act
sets
more
or
less
a
default
rule
absent
the
government's
agreement
to
the
contrary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
really
all
i'm--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
going
to
just
say...
before
mr.
rockler's
red
light
went
on,
i
was
going
to
ask
him
if
there
was
no
54(b)
issue
in
this
case,
i
don't
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1667,
baral
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
