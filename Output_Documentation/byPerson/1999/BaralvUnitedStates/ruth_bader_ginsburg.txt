but
that
language--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
rockler,
you...
you
recognize,
mr.
rockler,
that
that
language
was
dropped.
and
also
starting
from
the
'39
code,
the
word
was
may
and
then
it...
not
earlier
than,
and
now
the
word
is
shall
be.
and
the
caption
of
6513(b)
is
prepaid
income
tax.
so,
at
least
the
caption,
although
it
may
not
have
the
force
of
law,
at
least
the
caption,
prepaid
income
tax,
and
the
word
shall
seem
to
tug
against
the
position
you're
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rockler,
the
habig
case
was
about,
was...
was
it
not,
filing
a
false
tax
return?
so,
it
seems
to
be
quite
far
afield
from
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
to
encourage
you
to
file
your
return
on
time
to
say
if
you
don't
file
it
on
time,
then
you
won't
get
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
the
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
rockler,
i'm
concerned
that
the
argument
that
you...
you
are
making
would
be
detrimental
to
many
taxpayers,
and
let
me
give
you
this
example.
suppose...
let's
take
the
year
1988.
100,000
dollars
in
both
estimated
taxes
and
withholding
were
paid
in,
and
then
a
return
is
filed
in
the
year
1993,
as
here.
and
the
commissioner
determines
that
the
taxpayer
underpaid
by
10,000
dollars.
then
on
your
theory,
the
taxpayer
would
owe
interest
on
110,000
dollars
rather
than
just
10,000
dollars
because
he
had
never
paid
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
not
paid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
say
it's
payment
for
some
purposes
and
not
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
rockler,
the...
the
taxpayer,
instead
of
filing
this
under
the
form
for
a
deposit,
signed
a
voucher
that
went
along
with
his
estimated
tax
payment
that
said
he
was
tendering
so
much
as
an
income
tax
payment.
that
was
the
word
used
on
the
voucher,
was
it
not?
income
tax
payment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
words
were
i
tender
this
as
an
income
tax
payment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
was
not...
that
was
no
fault
of
the
government,
was
it,
mr.
rockler,
that
he
didn't
retain--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--his
return?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rockler,
what...
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
did
it
arise
under
the
'39
code
or
the
'54
code?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we
have...
we
have
a
different
code,
and
we
have
a
different
government
practice.
whatever
you
have
explained
about
credits,
justice
frankfurter
did
use
the
word
escrow,
that
this
was
put
in
an
escrow
account.
so,
it
sounds
like
a
special
arrangement
that
the
government
had
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
statute
read
may
not
shall
in...
in
'39.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
mr.
rockler
does
get
some
comfort
from
the
language
in
rosenman
that
says
that
you
don't
pay
it
till
it's
determined
how
much
it
should
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
i
put
that
case
to
mr.
rockler,
he
said
no,
that's
not
what
would
happen.
