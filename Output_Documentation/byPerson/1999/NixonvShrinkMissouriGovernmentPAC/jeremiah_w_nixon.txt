mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
23
years
ago
this
court
decided
in
buckley
v.
valeo
that
a
1,000
dollar
campaign
contribution
limit,
applicable
to
elections
for
federal
office,
was
constitutionally
valid.
legislatures
and
city
councils
across
the
country
have
adopted
contribution
limits
relying
on
that
holding.
the
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
a
direct
challenge
to
the
continuing
validity
of
the
buckley
ruling.
respondents
say
that
the
court's
first
amendment
decisions
have
supplemented
buckley,
but
this
is
a
thinly
veiled
contention
that
the
court
should
overrule
buckley.
respondents'
amici
more
honestly
urge
the
court
to
overrule
the
contribution
holding
in
buckley.
respondents
have
not
made
the
convincing
showing
necessary
to
depart
from
settled
principles
of
stare
decisis.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
there
may
be
times,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
the
level
does
get
too
low,
but
in
this
case
they've
clearly
not
proven
that
it's
different
in
kind,
nor
have
they
proven
the
ultimate
burden,
which
is
that
the
speech
of
candidates
in
campaigns
has
been
impaired.
to
the
contrary
is
true.
with
the
limits,
the
amount
of
money
expended
by
candidates
has
expanded.
consequently,
this
situation
is
not
the
place
in
which
inflation
would
drive
this
limit
to
be
unuseful.
nothing
has
happened,
either
legally
or
socially--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--it
doesn't
change
their
burden,
however,
justice
scalia,
and
their
burden
is
to
show
that
the
1,000
dollars
is
different
in
kind,
and
that
speech
of
a
class
of
candidates
has
been
dramatically
impaired.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
many
candidates
do
have
to
spend
more
time,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
if
it
is,
your
honor,
the
threat
of
having
candidates
on
the
phone
talking
to
members
of
their
constituency,
asking
for
their
help
and
support,
pales
in
comparison
to
the
risk
that
the
perception
of
corruption
with
large
contributions
raises.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
requires
a
quid
pro
quo
under
buckley
in
order
to
have
a
perception
of
corruption.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
well,
corruption
is
dollars
to
influence
action
contrary
to
what
the
position
of
the
elected
or
appointed
official
would
be.
the
perception
of
corruption
is
really
when
the
public
sees
a
donor
hand
a
candidate
a
large
amount
of
money,
i
mean,
it's
fanciful
to--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
i'm
not,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--your
honor,
in
the
ordinary
case,
there's
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
now,
the
shift
in
the
burden
that
occurs
when
the
first
amendment
is
at
play
is
halted
here,
because
missouri
passed
a
statute
that
mirrors
the
statute
approved
by
this
court
in
buckley.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
and
in
this
case
we've
put
forth
powerful
testimony,
not
only
the
affidavit
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
who
held
hearings
throughout
the
state
and
in
a
bipartisan
fashion
passed
the
campaign
finance
measure
that's
at
play
here,
but
also
the
plebescite
of
the
people
of
our
state,
in
which
74
percent
people
strong
voted
for
a
limit,
one-third
the
limit
of
what
this
limit
is.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
evidence
of
corruption,
your
honor?
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor,
we
would--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is.
i
think--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--the
affidavit
of
senator
goode,
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
that
took
the
testimony
that
passed
the
measure
specifically
indicates
that
that
is
an
important
part
of
their
difference.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
he
did
not
give
specific
instances
in
the
affidavit,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
in
that
testimony
and
in
that
affidavit
he
said
that
corruption,
as
i
indicated
before,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
when
the
public
sees
a
donor
hand...
you
know,
when
a
donor
hands
money
to
a
politician,
it
is
inherently
likely
to
cause
actual
apparent
corruption.
it
is
inherent.
when
you...
when
the
public
sees
large
amounts
of
money
handed
directly
to
candidates--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--the
perception
would
not
change.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
you
are
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
in
saying
that
the
language
is
exactly
out
of
buckley.
also,
judge
gibson
of
the
eighth
circuit
indicated
that
our
proof
was
stronger
than
the
proof
in
this
particular
area
in
buckley,
and
i
think
that
our
proof
was
stronger.
both
23
years
of
history,
the
continuing
problem
as
it
exists
in
our
country,
as
well
as
the
pacific
evidence
here
of
senator
goode's
affidavit--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no.
mirroring,
a
politician
mirroring
his
views
to
the
people
he
represents
is
not
corruption.
that's
democracy.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
only
corruption
when
he
acts
contrary
to
what
his
other...
his
position
would
otherwise
be.
the
every-day
operation
of
government
in
which
campaigns
run
and
politics
occurs
is
part
of
the
vibrancy
of
our
democracy,
and
there's
nothing
corrupt
about
that
particular
general
process.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
and
to
the
amount
above
the
1,000
dollars--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--it
certainly
lays
out
a
perception
of
corruption,
the
dollars--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
it's
the
question...
excuse
me,
your
honor,
but
the
question
would
be--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is,
in
the
technical
sense
of
our
laws,
actions
by
that
labor
union
might
also
be
illegal
if
they
were
a
contribution
to
the
candidate
in
above
the
amount
of
1,000
dollars.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
missouri
legislature,
as
well
as--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--the
amount
of...
your
honor,
it's
not
different
if
the
actions
are
the
same.
if
you
give
10,000
dollars
or
do
10,000
dollars
as
a
direct
contribution
of
some
other
sort,
of
working
for
someone,
it's
the
same
under
the
laws.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
missouri
legislature,
justice
rehnquist,
has
not
found
that
that
particular
problem
warrants
the
level
of
control
that
the
handing
of
money
does.
they
may,
at
some
future
time,
indicate
that
that
conduct
is
also
of
the
type
that
might.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
they
can,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
they
can,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
as
buckley
said,
they
are
uniquely
positioned
to
ascertain--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes,
justice.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
both,
but--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--both,
but
the
paramount
interest
is
that
of
the
candidate,
and
his
or
her
ability
to
speak.
that
is
the
greater
speech
question.
the
secondary
question
of
the
contributor
is
more
of
an
associational
right,
almost
speech
by
proxy.
when
you
give
money
to
a
campaign--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--i
don't
understand.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
it
could.
it
well
could,
your
honor,
burden
a
candidate's
right.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
think
the
standards...
the
standard
for
expenditures
is
clearly
strict
scrutiny.
the
court
in
buckley
held
that
the
standard
in
this
case
was
less
than
that,
in
essence
what
they
quote
as
a
rigorous
standard
of
review.
we
would
argue
that
that
standard's
somewhat
under
the
standard
of
strict
scrutiny
for
expenditures.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
record
indicates,
justice
stevens,
that
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
money,
less
than
2
percent
of
all
candidates,
was
raised
at
levels
above
1,000
dollars.
it
also
indicates--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
number.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
2
percent
of
the
state-wide
candidates
involved
in
the--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
it
might
be
the
case
in
another
state.
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
state
of
missouri,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor,
i
believe
it
disfavors
corruption.
i--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--i...
no,
i
don't--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--they
may
have
more,
your
honor,
but
i
would
posit
that
the
ability
of
someone
who's
in
office
to
sell
their
vote,
that
vote
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
a
challenger,
and
consequently
the
level
of
corruption
and
potential
corruption
is
dramatic,
and
consequently,
as...
you
know,
so
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
factors
involved
in
the
practicalities
of
politics
and
running
races,
and
incumbents
and
challengers,
but
the
system
has
been
vibrant
and
alive
with
these
limits
across
this
country
for
23
years.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
formula,
the
standard
of
scrutiny
would
be
a
rigorous
standard
of
review,
somewhat
less
than
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
well,
clearly
the
level
of
proof
of
the
burden
to
show
the
harm
varies
with
the
type
of
harm
at
issue
here,
and
there's
a
significant
and
real
harm.
your
honor,
we
are
comfortable
with
the
standard
established
in
buckley,
a
rigorous
standard
of
review.
we
feel
that
standard
is
appropriate.
it's
stood
the
test
of
time.
it
has
allowed
across
this
country
courts
where
limits
were
too
low
to
be
thrown
out
in
trial
courts
such
as
here
in
the
district,
as
well
as
in
california,
as
well
as
in
missouri,
in
our
first
case.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
worked
out
much
better
than
the
alternatives,
your
honor,
and
quite
frankly,
walking
away
from
buckley
at
this
particular
point
would
consign
the
vast
majority
of
the
citizens
of
our
country
to
a
situation
in
which
they
believed,
if
there
were
no
limits,
that
their
government
was
literally
for
sale.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
our
sense
is
yes,
your
honor,
that
it
does.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
well,
that
would
be
speech,
obviously,
your
honor,
but
that's--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--expenditure--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
your
honor.
we're
not
asking
to
limit--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
i
don't
believe
that
you
can.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
that
it's
much
more
direct
speech,
your
honor.
that's--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--it's
much
more
direct.
it's
not
speech
by
proxy.
it's
a
direct
speech.
it
is
the
action
of--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--expending.
you
as
the
candidate.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
thought
you
said
the
limit
of
the
expenditure
that
can
be
spent--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--congress,
or
the
missouri
legislature,
might
be
so
inclined
at
a
later
date.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
pass
first
amendment
muster
based
on
the
analysis
of
buckley,
but
it
is
certainly
not
the
case
presented
here.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can.
