unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
inflation
argument,
general
nixon?
i
mean,
supposing
we
had
a
campaign
limit
of
contribution
enacted
instead
of
in
1974,
in
the
depths
of
the
depression,
and
it
came
up
many
years
later,
would
you
say
that
that
was
an
attack
on
stare
decisis
to
say
this
at
this
level
is
too
low?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
the
fact
that
it's
expanded
doesn't
prove
anything.
i
mean,
it
might
have
expanded
more
than
that.
it's
expanded,
perhaps,
because
of
the
new
electronic
media
that
give
candidates
so
much
more
opportunity
to
try
to
reach
the
public
with
their
views,
and
it
costs
a
lot
of
money,
so
the
fact
that
more
money
is
spent
doesn't
prove
a
thing.
ten
times
as
much
might
have
been
spent.
there
might
have
been
ten
times
as
much
speech,
but
for
the
campaign
limits.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you...
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
amount
of
time
spent
by
candidates
in
the
raising
of
money
has
radically
increased?
unknown
speaker
an
enormous
amount
of
political
campaigning
consists
of
so-called
fundraisers.
is
that
not
a...
an
obvious
consequence
of
the
extremely
low
amount
they
can
get
from
each
individual?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
perception
of
corruption.
precisely
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
do
you
mean
the
sense
that
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
that
mr.
smith
gives
5,000
dollars
to
a
legislator
and
in
turn
the
legislature
agrees
to
do
something
for
mr.
smith?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
perception
of
corruption,
that
phrase.
unknown
speaker
are
you
convinced
that
that
perception
has
diminished
since
buckley?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
that
make
it
very
important
for
you
to
tell
us
precisely
what
interest
is
being
served
by
the
missouri
statute?
now,
you
say
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
to
show
that
his
speech
is
diminished.
i
had
thought
it
was
quite
the
opposite.
i
had
thought
the
burden
was
on
you
to
show
that
there's
a
subsisting,
existing
interest
that's
served
by
this
legislation.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
because
of
the
holding
in
buckley
that
it's
no
longer
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
establish
the
interest
that
the
state
has
to
support
this?
i
think
that
the...
if
you
read
all
the
opinions
in
buckley,
the
court
still
said
the
state
statute
would
have
to
pass
rigorous
first
amendment
scrutiny,
and
that
incorporates
establishing
what
the
state
purpose
is
of
the
legislation
and
whether
it's
sufficiently
important
to
justify
whatever
infringement
may
exist,
so
it
is
important
to
know
exactly
what
missouri
has
put
forward
to
justify
the
legislation.
unknown
speaker
i
think
justice
o'connor
is
talking
about
evidence
of
this
specter
of
corruption.
what
kind
of
evidence
of
that
was
there?
unknown
speaker
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
that
would
arise
from
allowing
a
person
to
give
more
than
1,000
dollars
to
a
campaign.
unknown
speaker
do
you
seriously
think
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
if
you
allow
somebody
to
give
more
than
1,000
dollars?
unknown
speaker
and
what
evidence
of
that
is
there
in
the
legislative
proceedings,
or
in
the
election?
i
don't
know
how
the
election
has
anything
to
do
with
that.
unknown
speaker
did
he
give
instances
of
where
this
corruption
or
appearance
of
corruption
raised
its
ugly
head?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
relying--
--did
he
say
what
he
meant
by
the
appearance
of
corruption?
unknown
speaker
mailed
to
them,
rather
than
handed
to
them.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
general
nixon,
the
inherent
language
you
just
quoted,
that's
straight
out
of
buckley
v.
valeo.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
proof
that
missouri
presented
and
what
was
before
the
court
in
buckley?
unknown
speaker
is
it
corruption
for
an
official
to
mirror
his
views
to
the
electorate
just
so
that
he
can
be
reelected?
unknown
speaker
is
that
corruption?
unknown
speaker
there's
worse...
that
causes
cynicism,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
is
it
corruption
if
he
uses
contributions
as
a
proxy
to
assist
him
in
making
that
determination?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
this
straight.
you
think
it
is...
i
assume
it's
not
just
money,
but
it's
anything
that
could
be
bought
with
money
in
the
campaign,
all
right.
now,
suppose
a
labor
union
tells
a
candidate,
you
know,
we
will
go
all
out
in
working
for
you,
getting
out
the
vote,
going
door-to-door,
ringing
the
doorbells,
if
you
will
support
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage.
and
he
thinks
it
over,
he
says,
okay,
i'll
do
it,
and
they
go
out
and
support
him
that
way.
is
that
corruption?
unknown
speaker
ah.
unknown
speaker
wait.
that's
not
corruption.
but
then
let's
assume
a
corporation
comes
to
him
and
says,
we
will
give
you
10,000
dollars
with
which
you
can
hire
people
to
go
door-to-door,
ring
bells,
do
the
same
thing
the
union
would
have
done,
okay,
if
you
will
oppose
the
minimum
wage,
and
he
says...
thinks
it
over
and
says,
okay,
i'll
do
that.
is
that
corruption?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
first
one
doesn't,
so
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
in
kind
or
you're
using
money
to
buy
it.
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
the
same
activity.
some
of
it
is
being
given
in-kind
by
the
labor
union.
the
other
is
being
purchased
by
the
corporation,
and
you're
saying
the
perception
of
corruption
arises
in
one
case
and
it
does
not
arise
in
the
other.
unknown
speaker
justice
scalia's
asking
not
about
the
laws,
but
about
the
perception
of
corruption.
why
is
it
different
in
one
case
than
in
the
other?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't...
just
your
view
as
to
why,
when
the
union
does
it
there's
no
perception
of
corruption,
but
when
the
business
does
it,
there
is
a
perception
of
corruption.
unknown
speaker
but
what...
you
say
it's
different
if
the
services
are
actually
in
kind,
with
no
exchange
of
cash,
that
we'll
turn
out
our
forces
for
you
and
we'll
pay
them
rather
than
you
have
to
pay
them.
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
it's
up
to
them
what's
an
appearance
of
corruption.
it
is
whatever
they
say
it
is,
and
they
can
come
down
on
some
things
because
in
their
all-powerful
discretion
they
can
consider
it
an
appearance
of
corruption,
and
something
else
that
looks
and
smells
exactly
the
same,
they
simply
say,
that
is
not
an
appearance...
can
they
behave
that
way?
unknown
speaker
in
the
first
amendment
area?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
think
we...
that
brings
us
back
to
what
is
the
test
that
we're
going
to
apply.
it
is
a
first
amendment
issue,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
normally
we
apply
strict
scrutiny.
whose
interests
are
we
looking
at,
those
of
the
contributor
or
those
of
the
candidate,
or
both?
unknown
speaker
what's
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
candidate
is
asserting
a
right
to
require
the
state
to
facilitate
his
fundraising
in
some
way?
is
that
what's
being
asserted?
unknown
speaker
how
far
does
this
go?
i
mean,
if
a
state
requires
a
certain
number
of
signatures
to
be
gathered
on
a
petition
before
one
can
be
a
candidate,
is
that
burdening
the
candidate's
first
amendment
right?
unknown
speaker
and
what
standard
do
we
apply,
then?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
general
nixon?
unknown
speaker
if
we
look
at
the
impact
on
the
candidate's
ability
to
communicate
to
the
electorate,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
the
situation
was
before
the
statute
was
passed
with
respect
to
what
portion
of
the
money
they
raised
was
by
contributions
over
1,000
dollars,
what
portion
was
raised
by
contributions
under
1,000
dollars?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
indicate
that
there's
maybe
a
2-percent
diminution
in
the
candidate's
ability
to
speak?
is
that
about
it?
unknown
speaker
that
was
2
percent
of
all
candidates,
right?
unknown
speaker
of
all
the
state-wide
candidates
involved?
unknown
speaker
but
it
might
have
been
the
case
that
some
candidates
raised
the
vast
proportion
of
their
funds
that
way
and
would
not
have
been
able
to
run
had
they
not
had
a
few
angels
who
came
in
and
gave
them
enough
money
to
run.
that's
quite
possible.
unknown
speaker
now,
as
the
argument
is
made
here,
and
i
suppose
it's
made
everywhere,
or
could
be
made
everywhere,
that
the
kind
of
statute
that
you
have
is
one
which
significantly
favors
incumbents.
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
good
statement,
but
it
isn't
responsive
to
the
question.
[laughter]
how
about
the
question?
unknown
speaker
isn't
this
a
scheme...
aren't
incumbents
more
likely
to
have
a
developed
broad
base
of
contributors,
a
campaign
network
that
has
been
built
up
in
the
past,
and
hence
be
able
to
go
out
and
get
lots
of
smaller
contributions,
whereas
the
new
kid
on
the
political
block
may
very
well
have
to
depend
on
a
smaller
group
and
need
more
cash
from
each
one?
unknown
speaker
general
nixon,
the
buckley
case
has
been
criticized
by
some
people
for
being
imprecise
in
the
standard.
it
mentions
rigorous.
it
doesn't
say
strict.
what
is
the
standard
that
you
are
asking,
do
you
extract
from
buckley
that
you
are
asking
this
court
to
apply?
how
would
you
formulate
it?
unknown
speaker
which
means
what?
is
it
just
a
common-sense
notion
that
the
burden
is
really
severe,
then
there's
a
stronger
justification
required,
and
if
the
burden
is
not
so
severe,
then
a
lesser
justification?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
it's
stood
the
test
of
time?
do
you
have
a
feeling
there's
great
contentment
and
satisfaction
with
the
election
campaign
process
as
would
be,
you
know,
the
half
a
baby
delivered
up
by
buckley,
where
they
struck
down
the
expenditure
limits
but
upheld
the
contribution
limits?
you
have
a
sense
that
that's
worked
out
real
well.
unknown
speaker
do
you
believe
that
the
buckley
standard
is
tougher
than
o'brien?
i
mean,
the
court
clearly
didn't
adopt
o'brien,
but
it
had
two
different
issues
before
it,
which
may
explain
why.
do
you
think
with
respect
to
the
contribution
limits
buckley
exacts
a
higher
standard
than
o'brien
would?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
nixon.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
whose
first
amendment
interests
are
being
burdened?
unknown
speaker
burdick
was
a
ballot
access
case,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
this
isn't,
strictly
speaking,
ballot
access.
unknown
speaker
do
we
apply
the
same
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
election-related
cases
where
the
state
has
to
manage
the
election.
you
have
to
have
some
rules,
and
those
rules
have
to
be
laid
down
for
the
state,
or
you
can't
have
an
election.
you
have
to
know
who
the
candidates
are,
how
you
qualify
as
a
candidate,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
in
the
nature
of
things.
in
the
nature
of
things,
however,
the
state
does
not
have
to
control
how
people
who
want
to
be
elected
go
out
and
convince
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
vote
for
them.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
require
the
state
to
make
one
decision
or
another,
and
it's
quite...
with
buckley
it
was
quite
new
that
the
state
should
intervene
in
what
previously
had
been
a
matter
of
private
first
amendment
activity.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
parts
of
buckley's
reasoning,
i
think,
was
that
you
can
have
campaign
limits
of
the
kind,
contribution
limits
that
were
upheld
in
buckley,
because
alternate
channels
are
available
for
the
potential
contributor.
is
that
true
under
missouri
law?
can
the
potential
contributor,
say,
join
together
with
others
and
buy
a
newspaper
ad
saying,
i
support
joe
blow?
unknown
speaker
would
that
support
a
particular
candidate,
as
opposed
to
a
particular
party?
i
mean,
suppose
you're
a
one-issue
person,
and
you
want
to
support
a
particular
candidate?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
corruption
is
as
defined
by
the
attorney
general
from
missouri
that
it's
the
chance
that
the
official
will
change
his
mind
based
on
the
amount
of
contribution,
is
that
the
corruption
that's
involved?
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
contribution
is
speech,
and
we
assume
that
it
is,
it's
hard
to
say
that
speech
is
a
subversion
of
the
political
process.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
traditional
principle
of
a
rational
basis
scrutiny.
you
know,
the
legislature
can
address
one
evil
at
a
time,
it
doesn't
have
to
take
in...
but
i
don't
know
that
we've
applied
that
very
literally
in
first
amendment
law.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
waxman.
unknown
speaker
mr.
la
pierre,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
first
accept
the
proposition
that
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
appearance
of
corruption
in
effect
is
not
really
a
serious
argument
here.
if
it
is
a
serious
argument
here,
then
the
elimination
of
corruption
to
the
percentages
that
you
mentioned
i
suppose
would
be
a
legitimate
and
significant
justification.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
is
it
difficult
to
estab...
i
mean,
i
assume
a
couple
of
things
are
meant
by
appearance
of
corruption,
and
you
know,
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
one
has
been
mentioned,
and
that
is,
i
think
most
people
assume...
i
do,
certainly...
that
someone
making
an
extraordinarily
large
contribution
is
going
to
get
some
kind
of
an
extraordinary
return
for
it.
i
think
that
is
a
pervasive
assumption.
and
number
2,
there
is
certainly
an
appearance
of,
call
it
an
attenuated
corruption,
if
you
will,
that
large
contributors
are
simply
going
to
get
better
service,
whatever
that
service
may
be,
from
a
politician
than
the
average
contributor,
let
alone
no
contributor.
now,
those
are
at
least
two
perceptions,
and
aren't
they
sound
ones?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not
sure...
and
i
recognize
that
you've
got
that
in
the
record,
and
i
think
that's
important,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
really
goes
to
the
justification
here,
because
the
justification
here
is,
we
need
a
political
system
in
which
there
is
some
kind
of
a
basic
level
of
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
people
governed
in
the
integrity
of
the
system.
and
political
scientists
may
be
reasonably
sure...
i...
they're
not
unanimous,
i
understand,
but
some
of
them
may
be
reasonably
sure
that
the
money
does
not
buy
what
most
people
think
it
buys,
but
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
refutation
that
most
people
do
think
that
it
buys
something
that
shouldn't
be
bought,
and
as
long
as
that
is
the
case,
the
argument
against
the
appearance
of
corruption
is
in
part
an
argument
against
the
cynicism
that
that
induces,
and
i
would
suppose
that
was
still
a
sound
argument
and
a
sound
justification.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
about...
excuse
me.
you're
finished,
are
you?
may
i
ask
one
more
question?
yes.
and
i
would
agree
with
that
approach
but
for
this
point.
what
we...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
courts
need
to
require,
certainly
in
first
amendment
or
any
other
areas,
by
way
of
empirical
justification
in
support
of
legislation,
depends
on
the
probability
or
improbability
of
what
is
being
asserted
as
the
justification,
and
it
seems
to
me...
i
will
speak
as
one
judge...
highly
plausible
that
people
assume
that
something
very,
very
good
and
extraordinary
is
going
to
be
purchased
by
an
extraordinary
contribution.
and
therefore
the
justification
for
appearance
of
corruption
and
cynicism
and
so
on
seems
inherently
plausible
to
me,
and
therefore
i
don't
know
why
a
court
should
require
as
high
degree
of
empirical
justification
as
we
do,
for
example,
when
effects
of
the
internet
are
suggested,
and
nobody
knows
how
the
internet
works.
so
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question,
why
do
we
need
an
unusual
empirical,
or
a
heavily
empirical
justification
for
something
which
seems
so
intuitively
plausible?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you?
if
missouri
had
brought
in
10
supposedly
representative
citizens
who
all
said,
yeah,
i
believe
that
for
big
amounts
of
money
they
get
big
returns,
would
that
have
been
enough?
unknown
speaker
but
the
impression
of
the
public,
i
thought
you
had
conceded,
was
certainly
itself
an
important
datum.
unknown
speaker
but
this
court--
--ordinarily
we
don't
try
issues
of
fact
that
are
involved
in
a
legislative
act
before
the
court.
i
mean,
the
proponents
of
the
law
don't
ordinarily
have
to
come
into
court
and
prove
that
all
of
the
assumptions
behind
the
law
were
correct.
i
don't
know
that
it's
completely
different
in
a
first
amendment
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
la
pierre,
the
buckley
case
says
there
was
inherent--
--would
you
let
him
finish
the
answer
to
my
question?
yes,
i'm
sorry,
chief.
please
finish
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
now,
will
you...
let...
answer...
justice
ginsburg
has
a
question.
unknown
speaker
yes.
there
was
some
anecdotal
evidence
in
buckley,
but
the
court
stressed
that
inherent
in
large
contributions
is
this
perception,
and
so
what
puzzles
me
is
why,
if
congress
could
act
on
that
assumption,
that
inherent
assumption,
why
the
eighth
circuit
could
then
say
to
the
missouri
legislature,
but
you
must
show
us,
even
though
congress
was
not
required
to
do
that,
unless
the
eighth
circuit
is
rejecting
buckley
to
that
extent.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
the
point
that
buckley
made
when
it
said,
inherent.
it's
inherent
in
large
contributions--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
will
be
this
perception
that
if
i
give
you
a
whole
lot
of
money,
you're
going
to
be
favorably
disposed
to
me.
unknown
speaker
but
is
human
nature
any
different
in
missouri
than
it
is
in
washington,
d.c.?
[laughter]
what's
changed
between
now
and
buckley?
unknown
speaker
other
than
we've
seen
that
buckley
hasn't
worked
very
well.
unknown
speaker
in
heartland
america?
i
can't--
[laughter]
may
i
ask
a
question?
we're
talking--
--well--
--sorry.
--but
it
was
a
serious
point.
why
is
it
that
we
can
depart
from
the
conclusions
that
the
congress
reached
in
buckley,
is
that
big
contributions
have
lead
to
real
instances
of
corruption,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
stop
it?
why
wouldn't
the
same
thing
happen
today
in
missouri?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about,
we're
talking
about
corruption
and
appearance
of
corruption,
and
i'm
not
sure
those
are
the...
actually
the
words
that
capture
what
may
be
at
issue
in
a
case
like
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
large
contributor
buys
access
to
an
official
when
he
makes
a
contribution.
he
assumes
that
the
legislator,
if
elected,
will
be
able
to
see
him
more
readily
than
if
he
had
not
made
a
contribution,
so
he
can
present
to
the
legislator
the
reasons
why
he
thinks
something
he...
is
in
the
public
interest
or
in
the
interests
of
his
company,
or
something
like
that.
would
it
be
reasonable
for
the
people
of
missouri
to
think
everyone
should
have
the
same
right
of
access
to
legislators
after
elected,
and
that
if
you
allow
people
to
contribute
25,000
dollars
or
so,
they
will
have
a
special
access
that
the
ordinary
citizen
would
not
have.
that's
not
exactly
corruption,
but
it's
an
appearance
of
unequal
treatment
that
borders
on
an
appearance
of
corruption.
would
that
be
relevant
in
the
analysis?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
person
who's
received
a
large
contribution
would
be
more
willing
to
see
the
contributor
than
someone
who
did
not
contribute
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
it's
corruption,
or
the
appearance
of
corruption,
for
a
candidate
to
give
more
time
to
the
people
who
contributed
most
to
his
campaign,
whether
they
contributed
most...
you
know,
with
sweat
equity,
or
whether
they
did
it
with
cash?
unknown
speaker
or
is
there
a
difference?
i
mean,
can
he
give
more
time
to
the
person
who
was
his
campaign
manager?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
thought
that's
what
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
was.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
give
more
time
to
those--
unknown
speaker
--you
know,
before
we
had
the
hatch
act,
we
had
a
spoils
system
at
the
federal
levels,
and
i
think
it
still
exists
at
some
state
levels,
where
once
you
get
in,
you
can
appoint
people
who
supported
you
to
the
jobs
that
exist
in
the
state.
now,
it
may
be
a
very
bad
idea,
but
would
you
call
it
corruption?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
try
a
thought
experiment--
--my
question
is,
even
if
you
don't
call
it
corruption,
is
it
nevertheless
relevant
to
the
question
before
us?
unknown
speaker
you
see,
there
are
cases,
i
think,
when
people
will
give
large
contributions
to
candidates
running
against
one
another,
because
they
want
to
be
sure
of
having
access
regardless
of
who
wins.
i
had
a
client
who
did
that
once.
unknown
speaker
well,
could,
say,
the
missouri
legislature,
really
wanting
to
clamp
down
on
this
access,
say
that
no
legislature
should
see
any
person
for
more
than
15
minutes?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
most
likely
scenario
for
significant
contribution
would
be
the
notion
that
i
will
give
this
money,
and
expect
in
return
that
if
and
when
i
ever
call
this
particular
official,
if
the
official
is
elected,
they'll
pay
attention
to
me.
they'll
receive
that
call,
respond,
get
in
touch
with
me,
and
take
seriously
what
i
have
to
say.
is
that...
does
that
give
rise
to
enough
of
a
negative
picture
that
it
could
justify
the
state
regulation?
unknown
speaker
but
the
first
explanation
would
be
bad.
you're
prepared
to
concede
that
if
i
think
it
is
quite
human
nature
that
somebody
that
gives
a
lot
of
money,
helps
me
a
lot
in
my
campaign,
is
going
to
have
my
ear.
if
i
think
that,
then
you
lose,
because
that
is
indeed
corruption
or
an
appearance
of
corruption.
unknown
speaker
no,
this
is
the
reason
for
it.
don't
invent
some
other
imaginable
reason.
the
reason
is,
this
is
one
of
my
major
campaign
contributors.
when
he
comes
around
to
the
white
house,
or
wherever
i've
been
elected
to,
i'm
going
to
see
this
man.
you
don't
really
think
that's
not
going
to
be
the
case.
unknown
speaker
even
if
there
isn't
corruption...
maybe
that's
the
wrong
word.
imagine
ebenezer
scrooge,
a
rich
man.
he
writes
out
a
check
for
15
million
dollars
for
a
particular
candidate.
the
public
might
think
he
owns
that
candidate,
whatever
goes
into
that
word
owns,
though
others
could
own
candidates
for
other
reasons
without
money.
why
can't
a
state
say,
in
our
democracy,
in
this
state,
we
believe
the
important
democratic
interests
are
furthered
by
not
having
very
rich
people
own
a
candidate.
we
want
to
equalize
the
opportunity,
though
we
will
never
make
it
totally
equal,
but
we
want
to
spread
it
around
a
bit,
so
a
person
with
1,000
dollars,
which
means
as
much
to
him
as
15
million
dollars
to
ebenezer
scrooge,
also
has
a
chance
to
participate
and
is
not
drowned
out
by
the
15
million
dollars.
why
can't
a
state
decide
that,
if
that's
the
kind
of
democracy
that
it
wants?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
thought
your
response
was
that
even
ebenezer
scrooge
has
the
right
to
participate
as
fully
as
he
is
able
in
the
american
political
process.
unknown
speaker
it
would,
because
suppose
the
state
of
missouri
believes
there
is
an
important
constitutional
interest
on
the
other
side,
the
constitutional
interest
in
giving
everyone
in
missouri
a
more
equal
chance
to
participate
in
this
democratic
system.
a
big
megaphone
can
drown
out
the
smaller
ones,
and
if
missouri
wants
the
smaller
ones
also
to
have
a
voice,
maybe
it
has
to
limit
the
size
of
the
larger
one,
and
if
that's
so,
isn't
that
just
as
important
a
constitutional
interest
as
the
first
amendment
interest
of
ebenezer
scrooge?
unknown
speaker
or
whatever
the
name
was
i
made
up.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
we
do
that
every
day
of
the
week?
i
thought
there
were
time
limits
in
the
house
of
representatives
so
that
a
person...
or
in
the
senate...
i
don't
know
about
the
senate,
but
i
mean,
i
thought
that
people
were
limited
every
day
of
the
week.
you
can't
talk
for
more
than
an
hour,
and
the
reason
we're
only
allowing
you
to
talk
for
an
hour
is
so
that
others
can
talk,
too.
what
do
you
mean,
you
never
can
limit
the
voice
of
some
so
that
others
can't
speak?
unknown
speaker
red
light
limited
the
voice
of
some
so
that
others
had
a
chance
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
and
if,
in
fact,
we
decide
that
this
big
megaphone
drowns
out
everybody
else?
unknown
speaker
maybe
a
better
analogy
where
everybody
has
equal
time
to
speak
would
be
not
limiting
their
time,
but
perhaps
stuffing
a
sock
in
the
mouth
of
the
more
eloquent
speakers
so
that
they
will
all
speak
with
exactly
the
same
effect.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
as
though
you
think
the
most
important
first
amendment
interest
in
this
case
is
not
the
interest
of
the
candidate
in
amassing
money,
but
the
interest
of
ebenezer
scrooge
in
getting
his
message
across,
and
that
was
downplayed
very
severely
in
buckley,
because
he
can
get
his
message
across
with
a
symbolic
contribution
of
10
dollars,
and
he
can
say
anything
he
wants
to
on
his
own
with
his
million
and
a
half
that
he
wants
to
give
to
the
candidate
to
let
the
candidate
decide
what
to
do
with
it.
i
thought
your
main
point
was
restriction
on
the
candidate,
not
the
contributor.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
not
somewhat
worrisome
that
for
a
full
year
after
the
announcement
of
the
candidate,
this
candidate
relied
exclusively
on
that
one
pac,
and
when
he
was
subjected
to
the
missouri
law,
did
appeal
more
generally
to
the
electorate,
and
the
idea
of
having
one
supporter
alone,
and
then
appealing
to
a
broader
segment
of
the
population,
as
he
eventually
did,
isn't
there
something
disconcerting
to
say
that
i
can
rely
on
one
large
funder
and
forget
the
rest
of
the
public?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it's
the
law
in
missouri,
as
it
is
elsewhere,
that
ultimately
before
you
get
elected
you
have
to
have
the
support
of
the
majority
of
the
people.
unknown
speaker
okay.
may
i
ask
a
question
about--
[laughter]
--about
your
show-me
position?
do
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
the
ban
on
honoraria
for
federal
judges
who
make
speeches
is
unconstitutional
because
there
were...
there
was
no
proof
that
federal
judges
were
corrupted
by
getting
paid
for
giving
speeches?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
asking
you
the
hypothetical
and
how
you
would
answer
it
on
your
show-me
theory.
is
that
ban
unconstitutional
if
we
assume
that
there
is
no
concrete
proof
that
any
federal
judge
has
been
corrupted
by
the
fee
that
he
or
she
received
for
giving
a
speech?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
on
that
reasoning
that
the
federal
judges,
the
ban
on
federal
judges'
honorariums
would
not
be
reasonably
justified
without
actual
evidence
of
corruption
by
a
judge.
in
other
words,
i
take
it,
on
your
view,
that
the
reasonable
appearance
statute
would
require
something
more
than
appearance
in
order
to
require
just
disqualification,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
it
necessary
evidence
in
the
cases
of
the
judges'
honoraria?
unknown
speaker
you
have
opened
the
prospect
of
great
financial
gain
to
me.
[laughter]
would
you
have
to
consider
federal
judges
as
a
separate
category?
that
limitation
was
imposed
upon
judges
at
the
same
time
as,
and
perhaps
because
the
same
limitation
was
imposed
upon
other
high
federal
officials.
would
the
test
group
necessarily
be
just
federal
judges,
or
all
federal
officials?
if
you
had
evidence
of
corruption
in
the
exception
of
speech
honoraria
by
high
federal
officials
in
general,
couldn't
you
extend
the
prohibition
to
judges?
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
congress,
or
hypothetically
the
state...
impose
conditions
on
the
holding
of
a
federal
office
that
it
couldn't
impose
on
just
people
who
are
not
holding
federal
office?
i
mean,
certainly
congress
has
limited
the
honoraria
that
members
of
congress
can
take,
it
limited
the
number
of...
the
amount
of
honoraria
that
federal
judges
can
take,
and
it
couldn't...
it
certainly
couldn't
do
that
to
the
general
public,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legislature
has
a
good
deal
more
authority
when
it's
dealing
with
holders
of
public
office.
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
one
of
the
collateral
consequences
of
buckley
was
that
the
system
has
become
obsessed
with
raising
money,
that
what
was
once
a
minor
function
of
a
congressman
or
a
senator
has
now
become
his
major
activity,
does
that
bear
on
our
analysis?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you
responded
to
my
question.
suppose
i
thought
that
buckley
had
caused
a
real
problem.
you
now
must
spend
much
more
time
raising
money
than
thinking
about
the
interests
of
the
public.
does
that...
if
i
were
to
conclude
that,
and
if
there
were
record
support
for
it,
should
that
bear
on
the
analysis
of
the
case
before
us?
unknown
speaker
and
how?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
show
that
the
legislative
remedy
was
not,
in
fact,
tailored
to
the
evil?
is--
unknown
speaker
--what
legal
standard
would
my
fact-finding
address?
unknown
speaker
well,
buckley
was,
of
course,
very
well-tailored,
because
it
contained
not
just
contribution
limits,
but
expenditure
limits
as
well,
and
that
would
work.
you
wouldn't
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
raising
money.
you
didn't
have
to
raise
money.
of
course,
that
would
give
a
great
advantage
to
incumbents,
incidentally,
but
that
was
invalidated,
so
you're
left
with
one
half
of
the
statute
without
the
other.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
la
pierre.
general
nixon,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
general
nixon,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question.
i'm
interested
in
the
rationale
that
if
you...
there's
an
appearance
of
corruption,
and
you've
made
that
point
very
forcefully,
that
that's
enough
to
regulate
the
amount
of
money
in
the
process.
would
that
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
regulating
the
amount
of
money
that
news
organizations
receive
for
political
ads?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
what
right
is
being
infringed
upon?
unknown
speaker
whose
speech?
unknown
speaker
whose
speech?
it's
my...
let's
say
i'm
running
for
office.
it's
my
ad.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
restate
it.
let's
assume
that
a
candidate
raises
large
portions
of
money
to
run
political
ads--
unknown
speaker
--on
television,
radio,
newspapers,
et
cetera,
that
you
think
that
that
raising
of
money
has
the
potential
of
corrupting
the
political
process,
an
argument
that
you've
made
for
limiting
the
contributions.
unknown
speaker
can
you
now
simply
say
that
because
money
corrupts,
we
are
going
to
limit
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
charged
by
these
organizations
to
run
the
political
ads,
not
their
editorials,
not
their
news
articles,
but
the
amount
they
charge
for
the
ads
themselves?
unknown
speaker
why?
what's
the
distinction?
what's
the
difference
between
limiting
the
amount
that
i
can
contribute
to
my
candidate,
and
limiting
the
amount
that
an
organization
charges
to
run
an
ad
of
mine?
unknown
speaker
whose
speech?
unknown
speaker
it's
my
ad.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
asking,
do
you...
using
your
rationale,
would
that
pass
first
amendment
muster?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
not
the
case,
but
my
question
is,
would
it
serve...
if
you
can
regulate
the
contributions,
can
you
regulate
the
prices
charged
for
running
political
ads?
