mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
by
noting
a
couple
of
comments
in
response
to
the
argument
so
far.
the
argument
shows
the
difficulty
with
using
an
appearance
of
corruption
as
a
justification
for
imposing
limits
on
campaign
contributions.
an
appearance
of
corruption
arises
whenever
an
individual
does
something
that
pleases
his
or
her
contributors.
and
second,
with
respect
to
the
difference
of
evidence
before
congress
in
1974,
as
opposed
to
the
evidence
before
the
state
of
missouri
in
1994,
congress,
when
it
acted
in
1994,
and
the
court
noted
this
point
when
it
referred
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
that
the
record
before
congress
was
replete
with
specific
examples
of
improper
attempts
to
obtain
governmental
favor
in
exchange
for
large
campaign
contributions.
missouri's
only
evidence
is
the
affidavit
of
senator
goode.
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
the
missouri
contribution
limits
on
the
amount
of
contributions,
the
record
shows
only...
and
this
is
with
regard
to
two
elections
that
the
state
of
missouri
examined
in
1992...
the
contribution
limit
in
1994
would
have
been
1,000
dollars
under
missouri
law.
it's
been
raised
to
1,075
dollars.
with
respect
to
the
two
elections,
that
the
state
of
missouri
examined
1.49
and
2.38
percent
of
the
contributions
made
in
the
1994
elections
would
have
been
barred
by
the
1,000
dollar
limit.
it
hardly
seems
like
contributions
in
excess
of
1,000
dollars
could
be
any
real
problem
if
the
contributions
that
are
barred
were
such
a
very
small
number.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
yes,
mr.
justice
souter,
with
i
think
one
significant
qualification.
the
appearance
of
corruption
is
amorphous.
it's
difficult
to
establish,
and
what
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--the
political
science
literature,
mr.
justice
souter,
would
suggest
that
the
general
perception
that
those
who
give
a
lot
of
money
in
essence
are
buying
votes,
or
obtaining
some
type
of
special
favoritism,
the
political
science
literature
suggests
that
that
is
not,
in
fact--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--well,
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue,
mr.
justice
souter,
that
government
should
never
care
about
an
appearance
of
corruption,
but
the
eighth
circuit
tried
to
address
that
problem
by
insisting
that
the
state
have
reasonably
objective
evidence
of
some
appearance
of
corruption,
so
instead
of
running
the
risk
that
simple
public
cynicism,
concern
about
the
quality
of
our
politicians,
instead
of
letting
ungeneralized
fears
about
the
conduct
of
government
overwhelm
significant
first
amendment
interests,
the
eighth
circuit
tried
to
make
sure
that
there
was
some
real
basis,
something
more
than
just--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--the
short
answer
is
that
we
don't
need
any
heavily
empirical
justification,
and
that's
certainly
not
what
the
eighth
circuit
required.
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
case
was
decided
on
cross-motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
missouri
had
as
its
evidence
only
the
affidavit
of
senator
goode.
senator
goode's
affidavit
was
not
sufficient
to
raise
any
question
of
material
fact
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
campaign
contributions
in
missouri
cause
any
real
harm.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
absolutely
not,
because
there
would
be
no
way
of
knowing
whether
this
impression
of
the
public,
which
may
well
be
mistaken,
should
override
important
first
amendment
interests
in--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--and
i
recognize
that
public
impression
is
important,
but
it
is
the
court's
responsibility
and
the
eighth
circuit
exercised
that
responsibility
by
attempting
to
make
sure
that
vague
impressions
that
there
may
be
some
problem
were,
in
fact,
more
than
just
vague
impressions.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
you're
correct,
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
missouri
has
any
evidence
whatsoever
of
a
problem
that
it
needs
to
address,
absent
some
evidence
of
a
real
harm.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
i'll
try
and
make
my
response
brief.
missouri
first
imposed
campaign
contribution
limits
in
1994.
there's
no
evidence
on
this
record
whatsoever
that
prior
to
1994
there
was
any
problem
with
actual
corruption,
and
the
only
evidence
that
the
state
has
with
respect
to
an
appearance
of
corruption
is
one
affidavit
from
senator
goode.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
i
believe
the
eighth
circuit
correctly
recognized
that
in
buckley
congress
had
some
evidence
of
real
corruption,
and
when
there's
evidence
of
real
corruption,
one
can
say
that
a
reasonable
inference
of
an
appearance
of
corruption
arises.
missouri
does
not
have
the
starting--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--well--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
and
that's
certainly
one
possible
reading
of
buckley,
that
an
amorphous
general
concept
of
some
appearance
of
corruption
was
sufficient
to
justify
campaign
contribution
limits,
but
it's
worth
noting
that
there
was
in
fact
actual
evidence
of
corruption
in
buckley
from
which
that
appearance
of
corruption--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that
human
nature
is
different
in
missouri
than
in
the
rest
of
the
nation.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
view
buckley
as
a
grandfather
governor
of
all
1,000
dollar
campaign
contributions,
regardless
of
when,
why,
or
how
they
were
adopted.
if
there
were
problems
in
1974,
and
there
was
evidence
of
actual
corruption
back
in
1974
that
warranted
limits
on
campaign
contributions,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
same
conditions
necessarily
prevailed
in
missouri
in
1994
when
the
missouri
legislature
acted.
all
we're
looking
for
is
that
the
missouri
legislature
have
some
evidence
of
some
real
problem
before
they
impose
limits
on
significant
first
amendment
interests.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
allowing
access
or
granting
access
to
those
who
give
a
lot
as
opposed
to
those
who
give
little
or
nothing
would
be
entirely
inappropriate,
and
there
is,
of
course,
no
evidence
on
this
record
that
anything
like
that
occurs.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
yes,
but
there
might
well
be
a
benign
explanation.
individuals
make
contributions
to
like-minded
individuals.
individuals
seek
to
present
their
views
to
like-minded
individuals.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
no,
i--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--i'm
not
willing
to
make
the
concession
that
giving
more
time
to
those
who
have
made
contributions
is
corruption.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
my
concern--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--if
it's
given
solely
on
the
basis
of
having
made
the
contribution
or
not
having
made
the
contribution.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
not
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
defined
corruption,
which
is
a
financial
quid
pro
quo,
no.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
not
unless
the
court
changes
the
standard.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
well--
[laughter]
once
again,
there
may
be
a
more
benign
explanation.
a
contributor
might
take
the
view
that
a
healthy
business
climate
was
good
for
everybody
in
the
state,
that
wide
expression
of
views
was
something
that
those
with
more
wherewithal
than
others
should
promote,
and
while
one
might
take
a
jaded
view
of
contributions
to
opposing
candidates,
it's
at
least
possible
to
take
a
more
kind
view
of
such
contributions.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
that
would
seem
to
disrupt
in
very,
very
significant
ways
the
legislator's
responsibility
to
meet
with
constituents,
learn
their
views,
and
make
informed
judgments.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
no,
because
as
i've
tried
to
state
earlier,
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
access
might
be
accorded.
it
might
be
simply
because
the
contributor
offered
a
lot
of
money
in
the
past,
or
might
offer
money
in
the
future,
but
another
explanation
is
simply
that
the
contributor
and
the
politician,
or
the
candidate,
or
the
government
official,
share
views,
or
that
the
sources
proved
to
be
reliable
in
the
past.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
it's
not
enough
to
justify
limits
on
important
first
amendment
freedoms
that
some
may
think
conduct
is
bad
when,
in
fact,
there
is
a
very
reasonable
and
important
reason
for
that
very
same
conduct.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
i'm
sure
the
individual
would
be
seen,
and
there's
nothing
corrupt
about
the
individual
being
seen.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
because
in
short
order
there
is
a
much
more
limited
response
to
the
difficulty
that
may
be
posed
by
that
exceptionally
large
15
million
dollar
contribution.
large
contributions
that
may
carry
a
general
perception
that
some
candidate
is
in
the
hands
or
particularly
beholden
to
the
contributor
are
easily
redressed
by
the
electorate,
who
can
make
its
own
judgment
about
whether
there
is
improper
allegiance,
or
debt
owed,
or
whether
simply
the
contributor
believes
very
strongly
about
the
ideological
interests
being
advanced
by
the
candidate.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
that
would
have
been
a
better
response.
[laughter]
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
the
interest
that
you--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--the
interest
that
you've
articulated
would
require
a
fundamental
overruling
of
a
point
in
buckley,
that
government
should
not
limit
the
voice
of
some
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
voices
of
others
are
amplified.
that's
not
a
basis--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--i
believe
in
the
circumstances
that
you're
raising
there
is
a
scarcity...
there's
only
a
certain
amount
of
time,
1
hour
for
oral
argument,
as
opposed
to
potentially--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--in
the
context
in
which
there's
only
so
much
time
for
all
who
would
want
to
speak.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
then
we
could
try
trusting
the
american
public,
which
has
shown
a
lot
of
good
judgment
in
the
past
and
seems
ready
to
recognize
when
politicians
take
too
much
money
from
particular
sources,
and
to
hold
that
against
the
politicians
who
make
those
decisions.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
that
analogy
would
be
similar
to
limiting
how
many
candidate
contributions--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--and
that
is
a
correct
perception.
the
most
important
point
is
for
the
candidate
to
be
able
to
garner
the
funds
to
allow
him
or
her
to
express
political
views,
and
whatever
was
said
in
buckley
about
the
effect
of
contribution
limits,
that
was
said
in
the
context
of
what
was
essentially
a
challenge
to
the
statute
on
its
face.
in
this
case,
we
can
see
the
actual
application
of
the
missouri
statute
to
a
particular
contributor
and
to
a
particular
candidate,
and
the
record
shows
that
the
particular
contributor
would
have
given
more,
the
candidate
would
have
accepted
that
contribution,
and
with
that
contribution
would
have
been
able
to
make
a
greater
expression
of
his
political
views.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
i
think,
if
you...
if
we
look
at
the
record
there
is
passage
of
time
from
june
and
july
1997,
until
february
1998,
and
the
committee
was
formed
in
june
of
1997,
the
first
contribution
was
made
shortly
thereafter.
but
one
has
to
look
at
that
record
in
light
of
the
political
realities
in
missouri.
things
did
not
come
to
a
head
in
the
auditor's
race
until
february
1998.
there
was
an
incumbent
republican
auditor,
margaret
kelly.
it
was
not
clear
whether
she
would
or
would
not
continue,
would
seek
reelection.
a
prominent
republican,
a
senator
charles
pearce,
state
senator,
was
considering
running
for
auditor.
in
february
1998,
margaret
kelly
decided
not
to
seek
reelection.
peter
kinder,
the
prominent
republican
state
senator,
decided
not
to
seek
the
office,
and
then
margaret
kelly
began
the
process
of
anointing
an
individual
in
her
office,
charles
pierce,
who
was
also
a
first-time
candidate
for
state-wide
office.
at
that
point,
there
was
a
window
of
opportunity
for
another
candidate
like
zev
fredman,
also
a
first-time
candidate,
to
seek
seed
money
and
try
and
make
his
way
in
the
republican
party.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
yes.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
it's
correct
that
in
national
treasury
employees
union
the
court
looked
only
for
evidence
of
harm
with
respect
to
low-ranking
government
employees
and
said,
although
it
was
not
directly
raised
by
the
case,
that
there
might
be
assumption
of
some
problem
if
honoraria
were
offered
to
high-ranking
government
officials.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
that
would
not
be
enough
to
justify
the
restriction.
one
might
think
of
looking
at
28
u.s.c.
section
455(a),
which
addresses
disqualification
of
federal
judges
in
any
proceeding
in
which
their
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned,
and
that's
the
important
point
about
the
eighth
circuit's
judgment.
it
looked
for
objectively
reasonable
evidence
of
some
harm,
and
it
held
missouri
to
the
standard
of
having
some
objectively
reasonable
evidence
before
it
could
impose
limits
on
important
first
amendment
interests.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
actual
evidence
of
wrongdoing
is
the
best
evidence
of
an
appearance
of
a
problem.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
i
believe
it
would
be
necessary,
because
otherwise
one
could
lose
the
services
of
a
judge,
or,
in
the
context
of
our
case,
individuals
could
lose
their
right
to
both
make
contributions
to
advance
their
political
views,
and
to
receive
contributions
to
advance
their
political
views,
on
the
basis
of
what
might
be
no
more
than
mistaken
perceptions.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
it
would
be
a
beginning
point
to
look
at
other
federal
officials
and
draw
conclusions,
but
not
directly
about
federal
judges.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
that's
correct,
the
standard
of
scrutiny
under
the
first
amendment
is
lower
with
respect
to
restrictions
on
public
employees
than
it
would
be
with
respect
to
candidates
and
contributors.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
no.
it
seems
inappropriate
for
government
to
make
a
decision
how
much
money
is
the
right
amount
of
money,
or
what
type
of
approach
to
campaign
fundraising
should
be
taken
by
candidates.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
yes,
and
it
would
suggest--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--that
contribution
limits
be
eliminated,
because
then
candidates
would
not
have
to
then
spend
so
much
time
raising
funds
in
small
amounts.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
it's
difficult--
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
--your
legal...
the
standard
should
be
strict
scrutiny.
we
would
look
for
some
evidence
of
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
and
then
the
regulation
here,
it's
a
contribution
limit,
would
have
to
be
narrowly
tailored
to
address
the
particular
problem.
the
contribution
limit
would
have
to
be
one
that
did
not
unnecessarily
limit
what
are
most
political
contributions
made
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
political
interest
in
a
vain
attempt
to
single
out
or
reach
the
set
of
contributions
that
are
made
for
improper
or
corrupting
purposes.
mr.
d.
bruce
la
pierre
the
assumption
in
our
constitutional
system
is
that
limits
on
political
speech
are
not
the
norm,
and
if
it's
a
choice
between
striking
expenditure
limits
or
striking
contribution
limits,
one
should
strike
both.
