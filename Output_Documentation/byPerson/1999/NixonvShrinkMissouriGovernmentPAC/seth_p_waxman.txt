mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
buckley's
validation
of
the
1,000
dollar
contribution
limit
was
based
on
three
holdings,
each
of
which
remains
as
valid
today
as
it
was
in
1976.
first,
that
a
1,000
dollar
limit
on
contributions
imposed
only
an
attenuated
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
second,
that
of
all
forms
of
political
support,
large
contributions
pose
the
greatest
threat
to
the
integrity
of
the
system
because
the
potential
for
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
are
what
this
court
deemed
inherent
in
a
regime
of
large
financial
contributions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
are
two,
justice
o'connor,
and
there
are
three
different
interests.
the
contributor
has
a
first
amendment
right
in
expression,
and
a
first
amendment
right
in
association.
the
candidate
has
a
first
amendment
right
in
amassing
sufficient
resources
in
order
to
produce
and
project
effective
advocacy.
looking
at
all
three
of
those,
either
separately
and
together,
the
court
in
buckley
concluded
that
a
1,000
dollar
limit
imposed
only
an
incidental
burden,
or
an
incidental
restriction,
or
an
attenuated
burden
on
the
three
rights
taken
together,
and
for
that
reason,
and
this
responds
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
the
court
applied
a
less-than-strict
standard
of
scrutiny
that
it
formally
announced
and
unanimously
adopted
in
another
election-related
case
shortly
after,
a
case
called
burdick
v.
takushi,
in
which
the
court
said,
in
an
election
context,
when
first
amendment
rights
are
subjected
to
severe
restrictions,
the
regulation
must
be
narrowly
drawn
to
advance
a
governmental
interest
of
compelling
importance.
but
when
an
election-related
provision
imposes
only
reasonable
nondiscriminatory
restrictions
against
first
amendment
rights,
the
government's
important
regulatory
interests
are
generally
sufficient
to
justify
the
restriction,
and
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
it
was,
and
the
burdick
standard
has
been...
first
of
all,
it
was
agreed
upon
as
a
standard
i
believe
by
all
members
of
the
court
in
burdick,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent,
and
it
was
also
affirmed
by
this
court
in
timmons
and
in
the
american
constitutional
law
foundation
last
term.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
you
do,
in...
the
burdick
standard
has
been
applied
not
just
in
ballot
access
cases,
but
really
in
all
election-related
cases,
cases
like
timmons,
for
example.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
precisely--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
why
the
burdick
standard,
or
what
this
court
referred
to
or
what
justice
o'connor
referred
in
her
concurrence
and
dissent
in
american
constitutional
law
foundation
as
the
variable
standard
also
applies,
as
it
did
in
the
other
buckley
case,
in
a
nonballot
access
case
where
the
government
is
restricting
what
people
have
to
do
to
get
their
message
out,
and
in
mcintyre,
and
in
other
campaign
finance
cases
like
california
medical
association
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
there
is
not
some
novel
standard
that
was
applied
and
inappropriately
enunciated
in
buckley,
but
rather
that
buckley
and
these
other
cases
that
i've
described
fall
into
a
rather
unbroken
line
of
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has
announced
where
in
the
election
context,
where
first
amendment
rights
are
involved,
particularly
where
what's
being
regulated
is
not
speech
directly
itself,
but
conduct
that
includes
speech
as
part
of
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is,
indeed,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
is
even
more
true
in
missouri
than
it
is
under
federal
law,
because,
for
example,
candidate...
individuals
can
make
unlimited
contributions
to
political
party
committees,
that
is,
political
parties
can
create
committees
and,
unlike
the
federal
law,
which
limits
how
much
one
can
give
to
a
political
party
or
to
a
pac,
missouri
doesn't
apply
any
limits,
and
it
permits
independent
expenditures,
and
volunteer--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
you're
a
one-issue
person,
justice
scalia,
you
have
the
same
rights
under
missouri
law
that
the
court
recognized
under
federal
law
in
buckley
and
its
progeny.
you
can
run
an
independent
expenditure.
you
can
contribute
to
pac's.
you
can
contribute
without
limit
to
political
party
committees.
all
of
these
alternative
means
exist.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
really
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
definition
of
corruption
that
this
court
gave
in
ncpac,
which
borrowed
some
of
the
language
from
buckley,
really
applies.
this
court
said
in
ncpac
that
contribution
is
a
subversion
of
the
political
process.
elected
officials
are
influenced
to
act
contrary
to
their
obligations
of
office
by
the
prospect
of
financial
gain
to
themselves,
or
the
infusion
of
money
into
their
campaigns.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i...
let
me
say
two
things
in
response
to
that.
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
contributions
are
conduct
that
has
an
expressive
component,
and
the
potential
for
corruption
comes
from
the
nonspeech
element
of
the
large
contribution.
second
of
all,
it
is
true
that
there
may
be
other
forms
of
activity
that
might
beholden
a
candidate
to
act
in
his
own
self-interest,
rather
than
in
the
disinterested
conduct
of
his
public
functions,
but
congress
and
legislatures
are
surely
entitled
to
focus
at
least
first
on
the
conduct
that
it
concludes
forms
the
most
immediate
basis
for
corruption,
or
the
perception
of
corruption,
and
which...
and
i
think
this
goes
to
some
of
your
earlier
questions...
poses
the
fewest
first
amendment
problems
in
terms
of
regulation,
and
i
think
that's
really
what
the
contribution
limit--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
if
one
looks
at
buckley
itself,
what
the
court
did
in
buckley,
in
looking
at
the
first
amendment
interests
involved
and
deeming
them
not
to
be
substantial,
it
found
with
respect
to
the
contributor...
well,
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
candidate,
that
the
candidate's
interest
was
in
having
sufficient
money,
or
sufficient
fuel
in
order
to
make
his
message
known,
and
the
qualitative
test
this
court
established,
and
this
goes
to
the
inflation
questions
that
were
asked,
is
whether
the
contribution
restrictions
have
a
severe
impact
on
political
dialogue
such
that
they
prevent
candidates
and
political
committees
as
a
class
from
amassing
the
resources
necessary
for
political
advocacy.
now,
with
respect
to
the
candidate's
rights,
the
rights
of
association,
which
are
stronger
than
the
candidate's
rights
to
speech,
which
can
be
extinguished
if
a
candidate
agrees
to
take
matching
funds,
as
the
presidential
funding
act
allows,
what
this
court
found
under
the
level
of
scrutiny
that
was
applied
in
buckley
was
that
the
contribution
limit,
and
i'm
quoting
here,
focuses
precisely
and
only
on
the
narrow
aspect
of
political
association
where
the
actuality
and
potentiality
for
corruption
have
been
identified,
while
leaving
persons
free
to
engage
in
independent
political
expression,
to
associate
actively
through
volunteering
their
services,
and
to
assist
to
a
limited
but
substantial
extent
in
supporting
candidates.
that,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
the
language
of
rational
basis
scrutiny.
it's
the
language,
at
least,
of
intermediate
level
scrutiny.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you
very
much.
