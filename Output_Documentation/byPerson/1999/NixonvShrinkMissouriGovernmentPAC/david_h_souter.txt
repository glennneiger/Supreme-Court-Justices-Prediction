justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
in
nixon
v.
shrink
missouri
government
pac,
no.
98-963.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
suit
in
this
case
was
brought
by
respondents
shrink
missouri
government
pac,
a
political
action
committee,
and
fredman,
a
candidate
for
the
1998
republican
nomination
for
missouri
state
auditor.
they
alleged
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
were
violated
by
a
missouri
statute
that
imposes
limits
ranging
from
$275
to
$1,075
on
contributions
to
candidates
for
state
offices.
the
district
court
sustained
the
statute
but
the
eighth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
under
our
1976
decision
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
missouri
had
failed
to
demonstrate
a
requisite
compelling
interest
in
the
limits,
it
failed
to
make
a
necessary
evidentiary
showing
of
problems
resulting
from
contributions
in
amounts
in
excess
of
those
permitted
by
the
statute,
and
it
failed
to
show
that
the
statute
was
closely
enough
tailored
to
serve
the
interest
claimed
by
the
state.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
although,
buckley
deals
with
federal
contribution
limits
and
federal
candidates,
it
is
authority
for
comparable
state
limits
on
contributions
to
state
candidates.
under
buckley
a
contribution
limit
involving
significant
interference
with
associational
rights,
survive
scrutiny
if
the
government
demonstrates
that
regulating
contributions
is
a
means
closely
drawn
to
match
an
important
interest.
the
missouri
statute
is
adequately
tied
to
an
important
state
interest,
buckley
found
that
the
prevention
of
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
was
a
constitutionally
sufficient
justification
for
the
contribution
limits
at
issue,
in
that
case,
missouri
espouses
the
same
interest
and
there
can
be
no
serious
question
about
their
legitimacy.
likewise,
the
missouri
statute
enjoys
adequate
evidentiary
support
which
we
cover
in
our
opinion.
this
case
does
not
present
a
close
call
requiring
further
definition
of
a
state's
evidentiary
obligation
beyond
what
buckley
indicates.
finally,
there
is
no
indication
here
that
the
missouri
limits
have
had
an
effective
suppressing
in
the
political
speech
necessary
for
an
adequate
campaign
of
workable
political
association,
and
thus
there
is
no
showing
that
the
limitation
prevented
effective
political
advocacy.
respondents
argue
that
buckley
set
a
nominal
minimum
$1,000
constitutional
threshold
for
contribution
limits,
which
in
dollars
adjusted
for
loss
of
purchasing
power
is
now
well
above
even
the
$1,000
line
drawn
by
missouri.
this
argument
is
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
buckley.
there
we
specifically
rejected
the
contention
that
$1,000,
or
any
other
particular
amount
was
a
constitutional
minimum,
instead
we
asked
whether
the
contribution
limitation
was
so
low
as
to
impede
the
ability
of
candidates
to
amass
the
resources
necessary
for
effective
advocacy.
