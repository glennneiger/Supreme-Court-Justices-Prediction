justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
mark
rotella
claimed
that
the
respondents,
the
doctors
and
related
companies
had
conspired
to
keep
him
hospitalized
in
order
to
maximize
their
profits
back
in
1985
and
1986.
rotella
discovered
his
injury
in
1986.
in
1994,
rotella
learned
that
the
hospital’s
parent
company
and
one
of
its
directors
had
pleaded
guilty
that
he
had
a
criminal
fraud.
that
fraud
related
to
illegal
agreements
and
improper
relationships
between
the
company
and
its
doctors.
in
1997,
rotella
filed
a
civil
claim
under
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
known
as
rico.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondents
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
four-year
statute
of
limitations
period
for
civil
rico
claims
had
expired
in
1990,
four
years
after
rotella
admitted
discovery
of
his
injury.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
rico
makes
it
wrongful
to
conduct
an
enterprise’s
affairs
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
a
pattern
consists
of
at
least
two
acts,
the
last
of
which
occurred
within
ten
years
of
a
prior
act.
in
agency
holding
company
against
malley-duff
&
associates,
we
adopted
a
four-year
statute
of
limitations
for
civil
rico.
rotella
argues
that
the
four-year
period
should
start
to
run
only
when
a
plaintiff
like
him
discovers
both
the
injury
and
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
but
we
declined
to
adopt
rotella’s
proposed
injury
and
patterned
discover
rule.
to
do
that
would
extend
the
limitations
period
well
beyond
the
time
when
a
cause
of
action
is
complete
and
it
would
undermine
the
policies
of
repose
and
elimination
of
stale
claims
and
the
promotion
of
certainty.
it
would
also
clash
with
the
limitations
imposed
and
anti-trust
suits
under
the
clayton
act,
which
congress
relied
on
as
an
analogy
when
rico
was
under
consideration.
both
the
clayton
act
and
rico
share
the
objective
of
encouraging
civil
litigation
not
merely
to
compensate
victims,
but
deterring
the
victims
themselves
into
private
attorney’s
general
undertaking
litigation
in
the
public
good.
such
a
benefit
is
better
obtained
sooner
rather
than
later.
the
clayton
act
analogy
reflects
congress’
clear
intent
to
reject
a
longer
rule
under
rico.
the
fact
that
a
rico
pattern
maybe
difficult
to
discover
and
often
involves
fraud
is
not
enough
to
support
the
adoption
of
the
rule
that
rotella
seeks.
