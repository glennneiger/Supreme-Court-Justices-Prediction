unknown
speaker
well,
there
could
be
a
third.
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
pick
between
only
those
two?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
we
use
the
accrual
rule
that
is
used
for
the
clayton
act?
unknown
speaker
namely
the
time
the
injury
occurs,
whether
you
know
about
it
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
the
rule
could
be
the
injury
plus
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action,
which
means
there
has
to
have
been
a
pattern,
and
i
suppose
that
principles
of
equitable
estoppel
might
be
available
in
circumstances
where
the
pattern
was
undiscoverable
due
to
conduct
of
the
defendants.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
some
cases
you're
going
to
have
affirmative
concealment,
and
the
equitable
tolling
would
address
that
and
let
the
other
things
be
governed
by
the
normal
rule.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
won't
work.
what
you
mean
is,
it
doesn't
help
you
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
posner
has
a
long
decision
in
which
he
explains
all
this,
and
he
goes
into
it,
and
i
thought,
well,
if
your
complaint
is
fraudulent
concealment
versus
equitable
tolling,
we
could
work
that
out
in
some
other
case.
the
basic
principle
is,
the
statute
of
limitation
starts
to
run,
and
an
unfair
result
is
stopped
by
principles
of
fraudulent
concealment
like
the
antitrust
law,
or
equitable
tolling,
as
in
fraud.
it
isn't
a
problem.
so
you
tell
me
it
is
a
problem.
what's
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
viewed
as
an
advantage,
not
a
problem.
the
reason
it's
an
advantage
is
because,
if
a
person
discovers
the
thing
after
only
a
year,
he
gets
an
extra
year.
he
doesn't
get
an
extra
4
years.
unknown
speaker
so
they
certainly
argue
that
that...
what
you
just
called
is
a
problem
is
the
best
thing
about
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
no,
no.
all
you'd
have
to
say
is,
stay
on
your
toes.
that's
all.
stay
on
your
toes.
you'd
have
to
be
reasonably
diligent,
and
if
they're
not
aware
of
what
that
is,
well,
that's
their
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
equities
on
both
sides
of
a
statute
of
limitations
case.
you
know,
memories
fade,
it's
harder
to
find
out
what
actually
happened,
you
know,
10
years
later
than
2
years
later,
so
you...
i
agree
there
are
equities
on
the
plaintiff's
side.
there
are
also
equities
on
the
defendant's
side.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
we
don't
just
apply
the
clayton
act.
i
mean,
you
know,
we've
established
that
this
thing
is
modeled
after
that.
why
don't
we
just
apply
the
clayton
act
rule?
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
response
to
that.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is...
and
therefore?
unknown
speaker
so
what?
unknown
speaker
what
follows
from
that?
why
does
that
prevent
you
from
using
the
same
statute
rule?
unknown
speaker
when
the
injury
occurs
from
a
pattern,
boom,
there's
a
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
the
injury
under
the
clayton
act
doesn't
have
to
tell
the
plaintiff
that
there
was
an
antitrust
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
may
simply
be
that
the
rico
injury,
that
there
is
no
rico
injury
for
your
client.
i
mean,
i
think
your
argument
assumes
that
congress
necessarily
intended
that
the
cause,
that
in
effect
a
plaintiff
will
have
at
least
a
10-year,
i
guess
14-year
suspension
to
determine
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action.
there's
a
simpler
answer,
and
the
simpler
answer
is,
maybe
what
congress
intended
was
that
if
you
do
not
have
the
second
predicate
act
within
the
4
years,
there
is
no
rico
cause
of
action.
or
indeed,
congress
may
even
have
intended
that
there
is
no
rico
cause
of
action
when
you
are
harmed
by
the
first
predicate
act,
even
if
there
later
is
a
second
one,
because
at
the
time
the
first
act
occurs,
there
has
been
no
pattern,
and
you
have
not
been
injured
by
a
pattern.
unknown
speaker
it's
only
the
person
harmed
by
the
second
predicate
act
who's
injured
by
a
pattern.
unknown
speaker
no
cause
of
action
until
there's
a
pattern.
unknown
speaker
no
cause
of
action
until
the
second
predicate
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
connection,
let
me
just
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
you
didn't
learn
about
the
guilty
plea
until
2001,
would
the
statute
start
to
run
in
2001?
unknown
speaker
it
does
work
against
the
plaintiff
in
the
antitrust
area.
people
all
the
time
buy
products,
they
go
to
the
cash
register,
and
they
pay
$10.
they
don't
necessarily
know
that
the
reason
it's
$10
instead
of
$8
is
because
there
was
a
price-fixing
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
no,
they
don't
know
there
was
a
price
fix.
they
bought
the
asphalt.
they're
down
there
laying
the
road.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
know
there
was
a
price
fix
for
years.
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure?
suppose
there's
a
pattern
that
falls
outside
the
period.
isn't
it
a
new
pattern?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hogan,
do
you
know
of
another
instance
where,
congress
being
silent
on
the
limit,
the
court
picks
as
the
closest
analogy,
as
it
did
here,
the
clayton
act,
and
then
takes
the
starting
trigger
from
some
place
else?
unknown
speaker
those
two
ordinarily
would
go
together,
the
statute
of
limitations
and
its
accoutrements.
but
here
you're
splitting
them.
you
say,
you
get
the
limitation
period
from
the
clayton
act,
and
then
you
get
the
starting
trigger
from
some
place
else.
unknown
speaker
but
then
why
borrow
from
the
clayton
act
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
the
statutory
period
if
you
have
a
different
accrual--
--why
didn't
we--
--trigger.
--borrow
from
fraud
analogy
for
purposes
of
determining
what
the
statutory
period
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
two
different
things.
if
you
say
there's
affirmative
concealment,
that's
traditional
equitable
tolling,
but
are
you
going
further
and
saying
that
even
if
there
isn't
affirmative
concealment
the
statute
doesn't
begin
running
until
the
plaintiff
knows
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
going
a
good
deal
further
than
saying
you're
just
fighting
concealment.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--when
do
you
say
the
pattern
came
into
existence
here?
unknown
speaker
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
pattern
that
just
came
together
after
the
actual
injury?
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
a
perfectly
good
state
cause
of
action
for
this,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
not
treble
damages
or
attorney's
fees,
but
a
traditional
tort
action.
unknown
speaker
suppose
i'm
injured
by
some...
by
someone
else,
and
do
i
have
to...
it
could
have
been
by
negligence,
and
it
could
have
been
intentionally.
i
only
find
out,
you
know,
5
years
later
that
it
was
intentional.
does
the
statute
on
the
intentional
tort
not
run
until
i
find
out
that
it
was
intentional?
of
course
not.
unknown
speaker
on
both
of
them,
you
don't
have
to
know
what
the
precise
nature
of
the
injury
is
ordinarily.
you
just
have
to
know
you've
been
injured.
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
say,
i
have
to
know
not
only
if
these
doctors
injured
me,
but
that
they
injured
me
by
reason
of
a
pattern.
why?
i
don't...
that
just
doesn't
track
normal
law
as
far
as
i
know.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
when
we
supply
that
doctrine,
when
we
invent
that
doctrine,
why
should
it
be
so
radically
different
from
the
normal
common
law,
which
is
that
you
have
to
know
that
you're
injured?
you
don't
have
to
know
the
precise
nature
of
the
injury,
whether
it's
negligent
or
intentional,
whether
it's
the
result
of
a
pattern
or
not
the
result
of
a
pattern.
that's
sort
of
picky-picky.
unknown
speaker
we
usually
don't
do
that
for
statutes
of
limitation.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
did
this.
suppose
you
had
three
rules,
a),
statute
doesn't
start
to
run
until
the
pattern
is
there.
all
the
elements
have
to
be
there,
all
right,
so
you
absolutely
say
that.
and
then
you
say,
2),
the
plaintiff
has
to
know
that
he's
hurt,
all
right,
and
then
you
say,
3),
as
to
the
rest
of
it,
there
will
be
what
posner
defines
as
equitable
tolling,
which
permits
a
plaintiff
to
avoid
the
bar
of
the
statute
if,
despite
all
due
diligence,
he
is
unable
to
obtain
vital
information
bearing
on
the
existence
of
his
claim.
so
those
are
your
rules.
can
you
give
me
one
instance
of
any
injustice
that
would
work?
unknown
speaker
i
read
you
what
the
definition
of
equitable
tolling
is
right
out
of
that
opinion,
which
had
a
fairly
thorough
survey.
on
that
definition,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
defendant
have
engaged
in
affirmative
conduct.
i'm
not
saying
that
would
be
the
law.
i'm
saying,
if
it
were
the
law,
can
you
think
of
a
single
instance
of
injustice?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
don't...
i'm
not
really
smitten
by
the
equitable
tolling
possibility,
even.
there's
certainly
no
such
thing
under
the
clayton
act,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
situation
of
your
client
is
even
less
appealing
than
the
situation
of
someone
harmed
under
the
clayton
act,
because
your
client,
even
if
he
doesn't
have
a
cause
of
action
under
rico,
will
have
some
other
cause
of
action
for
the
harm.
now,
maybe
the
damages
won't
be
as
much,
and
the
intimidation
won't
be
as
much
as
bringing...
you
know,
calling
somebody
a
racketeer
under
rico,
but
he'll
have
a
cause
of
action,
whereas
the
antitrust
plaintiff
has
nothing
at
all,
and
he
doesn't
get
equitable
tolling.
much
less
does
he
get
what
you
want,
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
a
cause
of
action
until
he
finds
out
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
state
law,
is
there
any
doctrine
that
if
your
injury
is
not
immediately
discernible
because
it's
consistent
with
adequate
treatment,
that
the
injury
discovery
arises
only
when
you
find
out
that
there
has
been
maltreatment?
unknown
speaker
would
this
case
come
within
that?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
under
common
state
discovery
rules,
that
there
would
be
no
exception
to
the
discovery
of
injury.
the
injury
was
being
confined,
and
that
begins
the
statute
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
he
could
bring
as
soon
as
he
discovers
the
fraud.
unknown
speaker
so
he
would
have
a
state
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
so
in
that
respect
he's
much
better
off
than
the
clayton
act
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
who
typically
has
no
cause
of
action
at
all
when
he
finally
discovers--
unknown
speaker
--anyway,
i
think
the
clayton
act
plaintiff
does
have...
he
does
have
a...
he
can
sue
if
it's
fraudulently
concealed.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
you've
looked
up
all
these
cases,
i
gather,
and
i've
always
wondered
this,
so
i
want
to
ask
you,
and
it
is
relevant,
is
there
really
any
difference
in
practice
between
fraudulent
concealment
and
equitable
tolling?
i
know
that
the
language
is
different,
but
i
never
heard
of
a
price
fix
that
they
wouldn't
try
to
conceal.
i
mean,
they
don't
want
to
advertise
it.
unknown
speaker
i
imagine
the
same
is
true
of
fraud
defendants.
they
don't
want
to
advertise
these
things,
and
so
does
it
really
make...
is
your
impression,
after
reading
a
lot
of
this,
that
it
matters
whether
we
call
it
fraudulent
concealment
and
say
the
defendant
has
to
have
acted
affirmatively?
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
call
it
equitable
tolling
and
say
it's
the
plaintiff
who
has
to
have
been
diligent?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
holmberg,
which
you
cited,
there
there
was
an
allegation
that
there
had
been
affirmative
concealment,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
the
court
is
talking
about,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
accept
that
as
a
basis
for
a
statute
of
limitations
where
there
has
been
concealment,
or,
you
know,
that
the
statute
didn't
run
until
it
was
discovered?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
help
you,
i
think,
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
concealing
just
that
they
were
taking
money
from
him.
they
have
to
be
concealing
the
wrongdoing.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
an
allegation
that
the
pattern
was
concealed
until
2
years
ago
wouldn't
be...
satisfy
the
fraudulent
concealment
tolling
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
would.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
answer
is
then
he's
using
due
diligence
and
the
statute
was
tolled,
so
he's
no
worse
off
either
way,
and
i
can't
imagine,
if
what
you
allege
is
true,
that
the
doctors
at
some
point
didn't
say,
don't
tell
anybody.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
omitting
the
fact,
supposing
the
guilty
plea
had
been
entered
the
day
before
he
walked
into
the
office--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
record
of
that
proceeding
gave
rise
to
suspicion
about
all
these
facts.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
supposing...
i'm
suggesting
that
maybe
the
record
or
the
publicity
attending
the
guilty
plea
put
him
on
notice
that
there
had
been
fraudulent
concealment
for
the
preceding
10
years.
then
he
would...
he'd
be
able
to
satisfy
the
fraudulent
concealment--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
hogan.
mr.
frazier,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
clayton
act
rule?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
argue
in
favor
of
the
clayton
act
rule?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand.
that's
why--
unknown
speaker
--and
we've
said
that
this
statute
is
modeled
after
the
clayton
act,
but
you
don't
argue
that
we
should
use
the
same
statute
as
the
clayton
act.
unknown
speaker
like
rico,
we
should
give
it
more
breadth
than
the
clayton
act.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
injury
here
that
should
have
been
discovered,
and
when
should
it
have
been
discovered?
unknown
speaker
when
should
that
have
been
discovered?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
frazier--
--he
didn't
know
he
had
a
rico
claim
at
that
time.
all
he
knew
was
that
he
had
some
claim.
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
abandon
the
clayton
act
rule,
i
think
what
your
opponent
offers
is
a
much
fairer
rule
than
the
one
that
you
offer
for
the
bringing
of
a
rico
action.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
frazier,
i
think
that's
not
quite
right,
because
built
into
the
discovery
of
the
pattern
is,
discovered
in
fact,
or
should
have
discovered,
so
there's
a
diligence
requirement
built
in
there,
too.
it
isn't
from
when
the
pattern
was
discovered,
necessarily.
it's
from
when
it
should
have
been
discovered,
so
i
don't
think
that
your
appeal
to
diligence
is
really
working,
since
diligence
is
essential
in
the
second
discovery,
in
the
discovery
rule
that
your
opponent
is
urging.
unknown
speaker
but
the
plaintiff
doesn't
know.
i
mean,
the
assumption
is,
he
knows
he's
been
hurt.
unknown
speaker
but
he
doesn't
know
why
and
how.
as
soon
as
he
knows
why
and
how,
he
can
state
a
claim,
but
how
can
he,
for
example,
if
he's
pleading
fraud,
plead
that
with
particularity?
how
can
he
state
a
claim
for
relief
under
rico
without
knowing,
or
at
least
without
having
enough
so
that
he
should
have
known
that
there
was
a
pattern
and
practice
of
racketeering?
unknown
speaker
what
diligence
are
you
talking
about?
are
you
saying,
if
he
diligently
tries
to
find
whether
there's
been
a
rico
conspiracy
but
can't
discover
it,
then
he
will
have
a
cause
of
action,
that
the
statute
will
be
extended?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
the
existence
of
the
rico
claim,
of
the
pattern
of
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
a
majority
of
the
circuits...
and
i'd
like
you
to
discuss
what
the
circuits
have
done.
i
thought
a
majority
of
them
had
applied
an
injury
discovery
rule.
the
plaintiff
has
to
know,
or
should
have
known
of
the
injury,
and
there
has
to
in
fact
have
been
a
pattern
sufficient
to
constitute
a
rico
violation,
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
knows
or
should
have
known
of
the
pattern.
there
has
to
be...
the
acts
have
to
have
occurred
that
would
establish
a
rico
violation,
and
the
plaintiff
has
to
know
or
should
have
known
of
the
injury.
now,
is
that
what
most
circuits
have
applied?
unknown
speaker
have
other
circuits
applied
the
pure
clayton
act
rule,
injury
whether
you
know
of
it
or
should
have
known
of
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
red
herring,
or
is
it?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
it
might
be
a
red
herring
because
i
never
heard
of
an
antitrust
injury
where
you
wouldn't
know
it.
i
mean,
what
it
amounts
to
is,
you
pay
more
money.
i
mean,
i
can't
say
somebody
couldn't
make
one
up,
but
i
never...
i
can't
think
of
a
case
in
which
there's
an
antitrust
injury
where
the
person
was
injured,
but
he
didn't
know
he
was
injured,
because
the
injured
commonly
is
writing
out
a
check,
or
usually
cash,
so
you
know
that
you've
written
a
check,
or
you
know
you
bought
the
toothpaste,
so
is
this
a
real
distinction
or
not?
but
you
mean
you
know
you're
paying
more
than
you
should
be.
no,
no,
but...
that's
not
knowing
the
injury.
that's
knowing
the
cause.
but
the
injury
is
paying
more
than
you
should
have
paid.
you
don't
have
to
know...
in
other
words,
you
have
to
know...
that's
interesting.
what
is
it?
let's
include
counsel
in
this
discussion.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
desire
neither
the
clayton
act
rule
nor
the
rule
that
justice
o'connor
just
described,
but
rather
some
third
rule.
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
you
assert.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
in
your
answer
to
me
you
said
that
if
he
didn't
know
of
the
pattern,
and
could
not
with
due
diligence
have
discovered
the
pattern,
the
statute
would
not
be
running.
unknown
speaker
you
did
indeed
say
it,
and
it
perplexed
me.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
let's--
unknown
speaker
--let's
assume
that
the
second
predicate
act
does
not
occur
until
after
4
years
from
the
date
of
the
injury.
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action,
or
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
oh,
come
on.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
statute
isn't
violated
unless
there
are
at
least
two
predicate
acts,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
another
way
of
construing
the
statute
is
that
you
don't,
that
there--
unknown
speaker
--is
no
rico
violation
until
the
second
predicate
act,
and
if
you
were
injured
beforehand,
whatever
your
injury
is,
it's
not
a
rico
injury.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
have
to
take
a
position
on
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
issue
we
have
to
decide
is
just
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues
for
limitations
purposes?
we
don't
have
to
decide
what,
if
anything,
would
toll
the
statute
of
limitations.
aren't
they
separate
questions?
unknown
speaker
right,
if
there--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
cause
of
action
accrued
on
the
date
you
say,
there
still...
maybe
not
in
this
case,
but
in
the
typical
case
would
remain
open
the
issue
whether
there
was
tolling
either
because
of
equitable
tolling
principles
or,
alternatively,
because
of
fraudulent
concealment,
which
may
or
may
not
boil
down
to
the
same
thing.
but
one...
i've
always
thought
the
burden
was
on
one
party
and
the
other
burden
was
on
the
other
party,
but
that
is...
we
really
aren't...
we
don't
have
to
decide
what,
if
any,
tolling
might
be
available
to
a
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
this
if
we
adopt
your
rule
on
the
date
of
accrual.
unknown
speaker
just
as
your
rule
has
been
applied,
but
would
you
explain
to
me
why
it
is,
other
than
it
makes
your
argument
easier,
that
having
adopted
the
clayton
act
statute
of
limitations,
we
should
not
adopt
the
clayton
act
rule
that
the
statute
begins
to
run
from
the
time
of
injury,
but
should
rather
adopt
the
rule
that
you're
urging
that
it
should
run
from
the
time
of
discovery
of
the
injury.
he's
not
advocating--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
you
are.
you're
advocating
that
it
runs
from
the
time
of
discovery
of
the
injury.
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
adopt
that
rather
than...
why
do
you
think
that
is
a
better
rule
than
the
clayton
act
rule?
unknown
speaker
why
does
that--
unknown
speaker
--why
does
that
make
any
difference,
the
wide
variety
of
acts?
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
acts
that
can,
you
know,
restrict
trade
as
well.
unknown
speaker
i
frankly
think
that
it
is
more
likely
that
you
would
not
be
aware
of
your
injury
in
a
clayton
act
situation,
these
economic
injuries
that
are
caused
by
a
conspiracy,
than
it
is
that
you
would
not
be
aware
of
your
injury
in
the
typical
rico
case
that,
you
know,
that
congress
had
in
mind,
which
was
a
case
where
you're
dealing
with
racketeers.
so
as
between
the
two,
i
would
think...
would
have
thought
the
clayton
act
rule
is
a
fortiori
appropriate
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
an
important
issue.
unknown
speaker
and
just
because
you...
it's
good
enough
for
your
case
to
adopt
the
middle
rule,
we're...
maybe
we
should
have
appointed
an
amicus
to
argue
for
the
lawyer
who's
going
to
be
following
you
in
the
next
case,
for
whose
client
it
is
essential
that
he
establish,
not
an
injury
discovery
rule,
but
an
injury
rule.
for
you,
it
doesn't
matter.
i
understand
that.
we
could
appoint
still
another
amicus
to
argue
equitable
tolling
in
the
case
that
comes
after
that.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
this
is
an
important
issue,
my
colleagues
having
corrected
me,
and
they
may
be
right
on
that,
they've
given
the
answer,
haven't
they,
that
if,
in
fact,
the
injury
in
a
clayton
act
case
is
not
paying
the
$2
but,
rather,
paying
the
$2
knowing
that
the
true
price
is
$1.50,
if
that
is
the
injury,
then
to
require
knowledge
of
that
injury
would
often,
if
not
always
require
knowledge
of
the
cause,
namely
the
price
fix.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
want
to
cause
that,
and
therefore
you
get
to,
the
injury
alone
is
sufficient.
if
that's
the
explanation,
the
answer
is,
that
isn't
the
kind
of
problem
involved
in
a
typical
rico
case.
the
kind
of
problem
is
fraud.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
not
that
kind
of
problem
in
a
rico
case,
so
i
put
that
for
your...
for
you
to
comment,
or
the
future
lawyer
to
comment.
unknown
speaker
or
whoever.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
really
academic
in
this
case,
because
there's
no
adversarial
contest
on
that.
what
you
have
to
knock
out
is
the
discovery
of
the
pattern
rule,
and
that's
enough.
i
mean,
for
your
case--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
reject
that,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
you
really
don't
have
a
contest
between
the
strict
clayton
act
rule
and
the
discovery
of
the
injury
rule.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
question,
i
guess.
we
just
have
to
decide
that
the
test
proposed
by
your
opponent
is
not
the
right
one.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
your
job
is
just
to
win
the
case
for
your
client.
you
may
have
some
other
clients
who
like
the
other
rule,
too.
you
may
be
a
plaintiff
once
in
a
while.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we're
consulting
what's
good
for
you
as
a
lawyer,
we
probably
should
leave
the
state
of
the
law
in
as
much
confusion
as
possible.
[laughter]
we
did
that
with
our
last
statute
of
limitations
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
very
certain
to
know
when
a
person
discovered...
i
mean,
that's
something
very
interior,
when
did
i
know
of
it,
or
even
when
ought
to
i
have
known,
ought
i
to
have
known
of
a
document.
do
you
really
think
that's
certain?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
a
certain
rule,
when
the
injury
occurs,
that's
pretty
certain.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
i
suppose
it's
analogous
to
when
state
fraud
causes
of
action
accrue
normally,
isn't
it,
injury
discovery?
unknown
speaker
may
i,
just
to
satisfy
my
curiosity,
ask
just
one
question
about
this
particular
case?
is
it
correct
that
in
the
rico
cause
of
action
there
is
no
relief
claim
for
the
principal
injury
which
this
person
must
have
suffered,
namely
the
impairment
of
his
liberty?
unknown
speaker
it's
business
or
property,
so
he's
not
claiming
damages
for
the
long
period
of
time
that
he
may
have
unnecessarily
been
kept
in
the
institution.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
frazier.
mr.
hogan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
a...
let
us
suppose
that
we
think
the
equitable
tolling
doctrine
requires
affirmative
concealment,
as
there
was
in
holmberg,
which
you
rely
on.
that
certainly
is
going
to
narrow
the
class
of
cases
you
just
described,
when
you...
if
you
require
affirmative
concealment.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
