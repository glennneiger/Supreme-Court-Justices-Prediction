mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
majority
of
circuits
have
decided
that
the
most
appropriate
accrual
rule
for
civil
rico
is
that
same
discovery
of
injury
rule
that
federal
courts
apply
to
civil
claims
in
general.
under
that
rule,
limitations
begins
to
run
when
all
elements
of
a
cause
of
action
exist
and
the
plaintiff
discovers,
or
reasonably
should
have
discovered
his
injury.
this
rule
is
particularly
logical
for
civil
rico
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
focuses
on
injury,
which
is
the
gravamen
of
a
civil
rico
claim.
secondly,
it
has
been
used
for
decades
for
federal
claims,
and
works
in
various
circumstances
with
various
facts.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
we
would
accept
the
clayton
act
rule,
your
honor,
because
we
would
prevail
with
that
rule.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
and--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
because
of
the
breadth
and
the
variety
of
the
predicate
acts
in
section
1951--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--because
of
the
variety
of
predicate
acts,
as
well
as
the
balancing
test.
as
was
mentioned
earlier,
we
are
balancing
the
right,
the
merits
of
having
valid
claims
brought
to
court
and
adjudicated
on
one
hand,
as
well
as
the
societal
interest
of
repose,
and
the
interest
of
defendants
as
well
as
the
courts
to
not
litigate
stale
claims.
the
injury-in-pattern
discovery
rule
advanced
by
mr.
rotella
would
result
in
claims
being
brought
far
into
the
future,
and
what's
at
issue
here
is,
what
should
we
expect
of
plaintiffs
in
their
civil
justice
system?
there
are
two
philosophical
differences
between
the
two
rules,
and
that
is,
what
should
a
plaintiff,
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
do
upon
discovery
of
his
injury?
the
rule
that
we
advance,
the
injury
discovery
rule,
would
require
the
plaintiff
to
exercise
diligence,
as
the
federal
courts
have
applied
for
a
long
period
of
time,
that
the
discovery
of
injury
is
sufficient
to
induce
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
to
investigate,
to
find
the
cause,
to
find
the
person,
the
perpetrator,
all
the
elements
necessary
to--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
injury
pursuant
to
the
complaint,
since
we're
dealing
with
the
complaint
allegation,
the
injury
that
was
alleged
on
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix,
at
paragraph
28,
is
that
mr.
rotella's
personal
items
were
converted,
they
were
withheld
at
the
time
of
his
discharge.
that,
we
submit,
is
the
only
allegation
of
a
property
injury
in
the
complaint.
he
also
alleges
that
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
479
days
when
he
should
not
have
been.
it's
a
personal
liberty
deprivation
claim.
he
was
treated
improperly,
allegedly...
he
called
it
even
child
abuse,
in
tough
restraints--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--that
was
discovered,
as
the
fifth
circuit
found
in
the
first
rotella
appeal,
during
the
hospitalization.
at
the
time
of
discharge,
he
was
aware
of
the
nature
of
his
treatment,
who
the
actors
were,
how
he
felt
about
that
treatment,
and
certainly
that
he
had
left
without
his
personal
property,
so
that
would
have
been,
your
honor,
in
1986,
in
june,
when
he
was
discharged
from
brookhaven,
and
under
the
injury
discovery
rule
we
advance
the
limitations
period
begins
to
run
at
that
time,
and
he
had
4
years
to
investigate,
to
act
with
diligence
to
bring
his
claim,
which
he
eventually--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
discovery
of
a
pattern
is
just
discovery
of
another
element,
and
it
would
not
be
fair
because
it
would
extend...
it
would
allow
plaintiffs
to
know
their
injury,
or
when
they
should
have
known
their
injury,
but
not
bring
a
suit
until
they
discover--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--well,
there
is
a
diligence
requirement
in
the
knew
or
should
have
known
with
diligence.
discovery
of
a
pattern
is
essentially
discovery
of
all
elements
of
the
cause
of
action,
and
yet
instead
of
bringing
suit
within
a
reasonable
time,
if
the
4
years
has
expired,
the
plaintiff
has
another
4
years
when
he
knows
all
elements
of
his
claim,
when
treble
damages
are
accumulating,
to
bring
suit.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
your
honor,
it
deals
with
what
a
plaintiff
can
discover
in
the
4
years.
if
he
has
discovered
his
injury,
and
he
exercises
diligence
to
investigate
that,
and
has
causes
of
action
to
redress
that
injury,
as
mr.
rotella
did,
and
pleads
a
case,
and
alleges
facts,
and
through
discovery
finds
out
that
his
injury
was
caused
not
only
by
invasion
of
privacy
or
fraud...
or
false
imprisonment,
as
he
alleges
here,
he
would
have
a
rico
claim,
the
cases
say,
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
allow
to
relate
back
and
to
amend
and
to
assert
with
particularity,
although
the
rule
has
been
modified
since
1993
to
allow
that
there
may
be
facts
discovered.
but
it's
the
diligence
that
we
require
of
plaintiffs
once
they
know
that
they
were
injured,
and
he
knew
of
his
injury,
all
of
his
injuries
at
the
time
of
discharge,
but
waited
8
years
to
file
suit.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
justice
scalia,
if
he
knows
of
his
injury--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--and
he
exercises
the
diligence
that
the
federal
courts
have
required
to
find
the
cause,
and
to
find
other
elements
of
his
claim,
if
he
doesn't
discover
the
pattern
by
virtue
of
a
tolling
doctrine
of
fraudulent
concealment,
or
he
simply
just
cannot,
by
fault
of
no
one,
he
must
bring
suit,
as
the
courts
have
held,
within
the
limitations
of
the
claims
that
are
available
to
him,
and
if
it's
undetectable
by
no
fault
of
the
defendant,
then
equitable
tolling
will
allow
him
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
under
rico
within
a
reasonable
time
after
discovery
of
the
essential
information
that
he
may
have.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
may
be
included
in
the
essential
information
that
he
would
need,
yes.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
the
majority
rule.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
no
circuit
has
applied--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
chief--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--no,
justice
o'connor
stated
the
majority
rule
that--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--yes,
that
discovery
of
the
injury--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--no,
justice
scalia,
i...
if
i
said
that,
i
misspoke.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
well,
what
i
was
saying
is,
is
that
if
all
elements
exist,
and
a
plaintiff
discovers
or
should
discover
his
injury,
that
is
the
majority
rule.
that
is
the
majority
rule,
and
he
has
the
burden
to
exercise
diligence
to
bring
a
claim.
if,
justice
scalia,
he
does
not
discover
essential
information
within
the
4-year
period,
which
is
the
equitable
tolling
doctrine
by
chief...
by
justice
posner
in
wolin,
then
equitable
tolling
allows
him
to
bring
the
rico
claim
within
a
reasonable
time
of
discovering
that
essential
information,
but
the
cause
of
action
for
limitations
has
already
accrued.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
the
statute
has
begun
to
run.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
is
a
substantive
question,
your
honor,
that
frankly
the
courts
have
not
grappled
with,
and--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--yes--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--a
pattern
is
at
a
minimum
two
predicate
acts,
but
the
court
in
mccool
indicated
that
you
might
have
an
injury,
just
because
you
happen
to
be
the
first
person
injured,
that
you
might
not...
that
you
might
still
have
redress
if
the
pattern
arose
later,
but--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--right.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
because
it
does
require
a
violation
of
1962--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--which
is
a
pattern.
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
pattern
existed
at
the
time
of
his
discharge
in
1986
pursuant
to
his
complaint,
so
all
of
the
elements
of
mr.
rotella's
rico
claim
existed
in
june
of
1986
and,
critically,
he
was
aware
of
his
open
and
obvious
injury,
the
retention
of
his
personal
items,
and
the
federal
courts
have
determined
that
notice
of
injury
is
sufficient
to
place
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
on
notice
to
investigate
to
find
out
the
other
elements
to
plead
the
claim,
and
we
have
a
4-year
limitations
period,
and
that
has
been
held
to
be--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
injury
discovery
rule
that
we
posit
does
have
the
equitable
tolling,
but
in
this
case
they
did
not
stay
with
equitable
tolling
pleadings.
and
they
abandoned
those,
but
for
this
case
the
only
issue
is,
what
is
the
accrual
rule,
discovery
of
the
injury,
which
he
discovered
in
1986,
or
waiting
until
he
knew
or
should
have
known--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--there
was
a
pattern.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
is
correct
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
but
the
equitable
tolling
doctrines
have
been
applied
in
the
majority
of
circuits
that
have
applied
the
injury--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--no.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
injury
discovery
rule
that
we
are
advocating.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
because
of
the...
as
i
said
earlier,
the
variety,
and
the
broad
variety
of
predicate
acts,
some
52
criminal
statutes
in
nine
state
areas...
that
are
there,
as
well
as
we
think
it's--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--it's
a
more
fair
rule.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
because--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--uh-huh.
well,
under
the
clayton
act,
of
course,
there
are
four
primary
areas,
price-fixing,
and...
in
the
directorates,
and
all
those.
here
we
have
four...
or
52
specifics
that
have
different
elements,
that
have
perhaps
different
injuries,
some
more
overt
than
others,
and
to
account
for
that
variety,
we
just
believe
the
more
fair
rule
to
balance
both
sides
of
the
equities--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--well,
again,
we
would
not
be
upset,
obviously,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
rule,
because
we
would
prevail.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
well,
these
cases,
of
course,
are
so
fact-specific,
but
the
injury
discovery
rule
has
been
applied
broadly.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
uh-huh.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
mm-hmm.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
well,
the
majority
or
the
largest
number
of
rico
claims
do
have
a
fraud
element,
as
this
court
has
noted,
and
even
though
the
1995
private
securities
litigation
act
has
taken
out
securities
fraud
from
rico,
which
comprised
in
the
1985
aba
report,
which
this
court
has
cited
twice,
the
largest
percentage
of
rico
claims,
there
are
still
some
claims
based
in
fraud,
and
the
injury
discovery
rule
we
believe
is
a
fairer
balancing
test,
particularly
on
the
fraud-based
claims.
but
because
of
the...
in
the
clayton
act,
if
i
may
comment
about
that,
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
the
shearson
case,
that
the
complexity
of
the
clayton
act
is
about
the
same,
or
certainly
not
more
than
civil
rico,
so
they're
both
complex
statutes,
but
rico
is
unique,
obviously,
because
of
the
pattern
and
because
of
the
variety
of
predicate
acts,
and
that's
why
the
injury
discovery
rule
has
been
applied.
all
circuits
applying
an
accrual
rule,
by
the
way,
in
civil
rico
have
interjected
or
have
applied
a
discovery
rule
of
some
sort.
we
know
of
no
circuit
decision
that
has
applied
the
pure
injury
rule
from
the
clayton
act,
and
that's
what
we
argued
in
the
district
court
and
all
through
this
case.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
the
court
could
do
that,
could
decide
that
the
discovery
of
pattern
is
not
appropriate
and
leave...
once
again,
now
we're
down
to
two
rules.
if
the
court
decides
to
do
that,
we
would
prevail.
but
i
know
the
court
in...
of
course,
and
your
concurrence,
justice
scalia
in
klehr
indicates
it's
an
important
issue
that
needs
to
be
decided.
the--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--well,
that
may
be
true,
and
we
may
have
cases
where
our
pure
injury
rule
would
certainly
inure
to
the
defense
side,
which
we
represent,
so
that--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
the
confusion
would
help
all
the
parties.
because
of
the
variety
of
opinions,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
below,
that
there
is
such
a
diverse...
the
split
is
7-5,
6-6,
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it,
and
it
needs
to
be
resolved,
because
these
rico
cases,
of
course,
are
still
coming
into
the
courthouse.
they're
still
coming
in,
and
we
just
believe
that
the
injury
discovery
rule,
which
has
been
applied
for
such
a
long
period
of
time,
deals
with
that
more
effectively.
let
me
address
briefly
the
tolling
issue,
that...
particularly
in
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
mentions
that
in
u.s.
v.
beggerly
that
somehow
this
court
held
that
if
a
discovery
rule
is
built
into
the
accrual
rule,
that
equitable
tolling
does
not
apply,
and
that
is
simply
overstating
the
case.
it
is
not
true.
equitable
tolling
applies
in
all
accrual
rules,
as
this
court
stated
in
holmberg.
if
the
plaintiff...
to
take
care
of
the
concern
of
the
petitioner,
if
the
plaintiff
simply
cannot
discover
the
essential
information
with
diligence,
and
that's
the
key,
with
diligence,
then
the
courts
have
applied
and
can
apply
equitable
tolling
to
allow
that
person
to
bring
suit
within
a
reasonable
time
after
he
discovers
that
essential
information.
that
is
available
in
this
rule,
and
so
the
fear
of
not
knowing
the
pattern,
and
with
the
definition
of
pattern,
as
this
court
recognized
in
a
sedima
footnote
and
of
course
in
h.j.,
being
as
nebulous
and
nefarious
as
it
is
as
to
what
that
means,
delaying
accrual
until
a
plaintiff
discovers
the
related
acts
and
that
it
poses
a
threat
of
continuous
activity
would
just
delay
it
way
too
long.
and
we
need
a
firmly
defined,
easily
applied
rule
of
accrual,
as
the
court
in
the
garcia
case
mentioned,
and
the
injury
discovery
rule
is...
runs
from
a
more
ascertainable,
definite,
and
certain
event,
rather
than
the
nebulous
pattern
event,
and
so
it's
more
workable,
and
it
has
the
balance
of
the
parties--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--it's
certain--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--that
is...
yes,
that
is
very
certain.
discovery
of
injury,
obviously,
made
it
perhaps
less
certain
than
the
injury
existing,
but
it's
certainly
more
certain
than
discovery
of
pattern
and
what
one
must
know
to--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--state
causes
of
action,
justice
o'connor?
it's...
i
can
speak
from
texas.
it's
varied.
there
are...
particularly
in
the
medical
malpractice
field
it
is
discovery,
or
should
have
discovered,
and
not
existence,
and
i
think
it's
usually
discovery,
because
as
the
supreme
court
in
texas
has
articulated,
if
it's
inherently
discoverable,
then
we
will
apply
tolling,
or
the
accrual
of
tolling
through
injury
discovery--
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
under
civil
rico
there...
you
cannot
recover
for
personal
injury.
mr.
charles
t.
frazier,
jr.
the
complaint,
the
vast
majority
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
justice
stevens,
allege
such
an
injury,
but
under
rico
that
is
what
he
cannot
recover,
and
the
prayer
is
so
general
it
just
says
actual
damages
within
the
court's
jurisdiction,
which
doesn't
work
either,
but
it's
very
vague.
but
you're
correct,
he
can
only
recover
the
value,
i
would
assume
after,
now,
15
years,
the
value
of
the
property
that
was
withheld
his
personal
liberty
deprivation,
which
is
really
the
gist
of
the
case,
as
we
said
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert,
that
is
really
what
he
is
claiming
his
injury
is
from
the
rico
conspiracy.
they
committed
commercial
robbery
to
keep
patients
in
for
their
parents'
insurance
money,
in
this
instance
he
was
a
minor,
and
that...
so
he
was
there
for
this
long
period
of
time,
and
that
he
wouldn't
have
been
there
but
for
this
agreement.
so
that's
his
alleged
injury
as
a
proximate
result
of
this
alleged
conspiracy,
but
it's
not
recoverable
under
rico,
only
the
injury
to
property,
which
is
vaguely
tied
to
the
predicate
act,
but
that
is
his
injury.
so
he
doesn't
really
have,
other
than
just
small
injury
to
his
personal
property,
a
rico
injury,
and
the
bulk
of
his
complaint
is
a
personal
injury
complaint,
which
is
not
recoverable.
so
that
mr.
rotella
waited
11
years
to
bring
this
cause
of
action,
11
years
after
his
discharge,
11
years
after
he
knew
his
injury,
all
of
his
injuries,
demonstrates
why
the
injury
and
pattern
discovery
rule
simply
is
not
workable
in
the
civil
rico
context.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
submit.
