mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
parties
in
this
case
advocate
different
accrual
rules
for
civil
rico,
and
that
difference
is
starkly
illustrated
by
the
way
that
the
parties
view
two
important
dates
in
the
record.
the
first
date
is
1986,
when
the
plaintiff
was
released
from
a
mental
institution
after
479
days
of
confinement.
the
second
date
is
1994,
when
the
plaintiff
learned
that
the
company
that
was
operating
that
institution
had
pled
guilty
to
federal
fraud
and
conspiracy
charges
for
a
scheme
that
included
paying
kick-backs
to
doctors
for
keeping
the
patient
census
high.
the
defendants
contend
that
the
civil
rico
claim
in
this
case
had
accrued
for
the
statute
of
limitations
purposes
and
that
the
statute
had
begun
to
run
in
1986,
when
the
plaintiff
was
released
from
the
hospital,
and
that
therefore
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired
by
1990,
4
years
before
the
federal
government
had
even
announced
the
guilty
pleas.
the
plaintiff,
on
the
other
hand,
argues
that
the
rico
claim
did
not
accrue
until
1994,
when
he
first
learned
that
the
hospitalization
was
related
to
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
and
the
question
then
presented
for
the
court
is
which
accrual
rule
is
proper
for
civil
rico.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--the
template
that
the
court
would
take
from
the
clayton
act,
your
honor,
would
not
fit
for
civil
rico
and,
as
this
court
recognized
in
klehr,
the
pure
injury
accrual
rule,
it
suggested,
might
not
work
without
some
modification
in
the
situation
of
civil
rico,
unlike
the
antitrust
laws,
because
the
antitrust
laws
require
only
separate
and
discrete
single
acts
and
not
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
and
so
it's
okay
for
the
antitrust
laws
to
use
an
injury
accrual
rule.
we
simply
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
does
not
reach
this
question,
because
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
is
absent
in
the
antitrust
laws
when
it
is
present
in
civil
rico.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
equitable
estoppel
principles,
your
honor,
also
will
not
work,
we
suggest,
for
civil
rico.
obviously,
the
suggestion
that
we
might
need
some
sort
of
equitable
estoppel
principles
or
other
equitable
tolling
principles
suggests
that
there
are
harsh
facts
which
might
require
those
types
of
remedies,
but
we
think
that
the
rule
ought
to
address
those
things
up
front,
as
this
court
suggested
in
the
beggerly
decision.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
that
would
be
unworkable,
because--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--the
equitable
tolling
principles
that
would
involve
fraudulent
concealment
require
affirmative
acts
or
affirmative
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
conceal
the
cause
of
action,
so
that
if
the
defendant
does
nothing,
as
in
this
case,
simply
does
not
speak
and
remains
mute,
the
plaintiff
would
be
unable
to
take
advantage
of
any
equitable
tolling.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
it...
your
honor,
it
does
not
work,
and
there
is
not
a
single
case
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
in
which
equitable
tolling
has
been
recognized
to
apply
for
civil
rico.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
those...
the
problem
is
that
it's
an
indefinite
period.
an
equitable
tolling
period
never
informs
the
parties
of
how
long--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--but--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--well,
but
it
would
not...
it
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
predictability
and
certainty
that
should
be
an
aspect--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--it
seems
that
that
problem
ought
to
be
dealt
with
on
the
front
end,
and
instead
of
closing
the
courthouse
door
to
plaintiffs
and
forcing
them
to
take
on
the
additional
burden
of
opening
that
door
after
it
has
been
closed
with
no
determination
and
no
information
for
the
circuit
courts
to
apply
as
to
how
long
that
period
ought
to
last,
that
it
would
be
better
to
deal
with
the
harsh
results
and
the
equities
within
the
knew
or
should-have-known
standard,
and
tell
everyone
that
within
that
standard
there
is
a
4-year
limitations
period.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
we
suggest
that
congress
in
this
case
has
opted
to
tip
that
balance
in
the
favor
of
the
plaintiffs,
that
the
open-endedness
that
might
exist
because
of
the
knew
or
should-have-known
standard
ought
to
be
resolved
because
congress
looked
at
a
10-year
window
in
which
predicate
acts
could
happen,
and
the
balance
of
the
equities
ought
to
rest
in
the
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
the
clayton
act
is
geared
to
each
separate
act
which
produces
an
injury.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
rico
requires
a
pattern,
and
in
the
clayton
act
context--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--and
therefore
the
injuries
that
are
remedied
by
the
clayton
act
don't
relate
to
anything
that
has
the
nature
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
so
congress--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--what
follows--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--the
injury
must
tell
the
plaintiff
that
there
was
a
pattern.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
because
otherwise--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--because
congress
has
used
the
language
that
the
injury
is
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
section
1962,
which
is
a
pattern
of
racketeering--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--but
that
interpretation--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
would
render
the
statutory
language
meaningless.
when
congress
used
the
language
in
section
1964(c)
that
a
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
section
1962,
congress
meant
that
that
violation
was
from
a
pattern
of
racketeering,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes
there
must
be
some
discovery
principle
attached
to
that,
because
until--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--yes.
it
would
start
to
run
even
though
it's
open-ended,
because
congress
meant
in
this
case,
we
suggest,
to
have
a
tipping
of
the
balance
in
the
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
so
in
that
case,
as
this
court
has
recognized
before,
simply
because
the
secretive
and
hidden
enterprise
is
good
at
concealing
the
predicate
acts
and
its
enterprise
from
being
detected,
that
ought
not
to
work
against
the
plaintiff.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
for
two
reasons
that
antitrust
analogy
doesn't
work.
first
of
all,
in
most
antitrust
cases
the
people
that
are
injured
are
market
participants
in
the
relevant
market.
they
are
somehow
informed,
or
have
some
sort
of
commercial
expertise--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
at
least...
and
the
second
reason
is,
but
at
least,
if
there
is
a
separate,
overt
act
later
on,
which
also
damages
them,
under
the
separate
accrual
rule
in
antitrust
they
would
get
a
new
cause
of
action
starting
from
that
date
forward,
whereas
in
rico,
if
the
second
predicate
act
falls
outside
the
4-year
period
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
question,
then
there
would
be
no
remedy
for
the
rico
plaintiff.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
it
is
a
new
pattern
which
this
court
rejected
in
the
accrual...
there
is
a
new
pattern,
but
the
statute
would
not
run
anew
from
the
last
predicate
act,
as
this
court
said
in
klehr.
it
doesn't
start
over,
as
it
does
in
the
antitrust
context,
and
so
for
those
reasons
the
antitrust
analogy
we
think,
although
it
fits
for
the
injury,
and
it
fits
for
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
does
not
fit
for
the
purposes
of
accrual.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
yes.
you
get
the
starting
trigger
that
would
allow
the
purposes
of
the
statute
to
be
remedied,
and
the
closest
analogy
is
the
fraud
analogy.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
we
borrow
from
the
clayton
act
to
inform
us
what
the
statutory
period
is,
and
tell
us
how
big
the
hourglass
is.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
because
in
malley-duff
this
court
said
that
when
it
looked
to
those
state
limitations
periods
for
fraud,
they
were
divergent
and
not
uniform,
and
this
court
therefore
said
that
the
closest
analogy
for
the
limitations
period
is
the
clayton
act,
and
so
the
4-year
limitations
period,
but
the
fraud
analogy
is
what
works
best
for
the
accrual
rule.
just
as
in
the
case
of
fraud,
when
something
is
concealed
from
the
plaintiff,
the
statute
doesn't
accrue
until
the
plaintiff
knows,
or
reasonably
should
know--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
no
further
than
it
takes
to
recognize
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action.
without
the
pattern
in
rico,
you
may
have
an
underlying
fraud
case,
or
you
may
have
some
sort
of
common
law
claim
for
the
underlying
predicate
act,
but
you
would
not
have
a
rico
cause
of
action.
the
only
thing
that
informs
the
plaintiff
of
the
existence
of
a
rico
case
and
transforms
the
injury
into
a
rico
injury
is
the
existence
of
the
pattern,
and
the
conduct
of
the
enterprise
through
the
pattern,
otherwise,
it's
a
simple,
ordinary
tort
case.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
it
is
not
a
rico
case.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
your
honor,
the
record
is
not
clear
about
that,
but
we
can
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
it
existed
while
mr.
rotella
was
in
the
hospital,
before
1986.
there
is
also
another
predicate
act
which
the
record
reveals,
was
the
signing
of
a
contract
in
1990,
but
we
can
assume
that
it
existed
as
of
1986.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
for
purposes
of
the
argument,
that...
we
can
assume
that.
but
what
did
not
exist
in
the
plaintiff's
mind,
nor,
shall
i
say,
for
the
purposes
of
the
fbi
or
the
federal
government,
was
that
they
did
not
know
that
that
conduct
in
paying
out
insurance
benefits
that
were
depleted
from
the
plaintiff's
insurance
policy,
they
did
not
know
that
that
conduct
was
being
engaged
in
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
and
was
being
taken
from
the
plaintiff
in
violation
of
rico.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
your
honor,
we...
no.
we
would
have
certainly
ordinary
tort
remedies--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--maybe
under
fraud.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
exactly.
if
it
were
meaningful
to
pursue,
if
he
knew
that
there
was
a
fraud
committed,
but
in
the
same
way
that
he
didn't
know
that
there
was
a
rico
violation
committed,
mr.
rotella
also
did
not
know
that
any
fraud
was
being
committed
against
him.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
if
we
say--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--because
in
an
intentional
tort
case,
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
recognized
common
law
accrual
doctrine
that
would
have
applied
to
that.
there
has
never
been
a
recognized
common
law
accrual
doctrine
that
would
apply
in
the
context
of
the
language
that
this
court
has
been
supplied
by
congress.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
the
tradition--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--it
is
not
picky,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
holmberg
decision
in
1946,
to
say
that
until
the
plaintiff
actually
discovers
the
fraud
he
has
not
discovered
the
cause
of
action
and
cannot
sue
on
it,
and
the
court
ought
not
to
reward
the
wrong-doer
simply
because
the
wrong-doer--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--it
would
work
an
injustice
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiff
would
not
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
any
sort
of
equitable
tolling
doctrine,
because
there
is
no
affirmative
conduct
on
the--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--yes.
it
would
be
unjust,
and
would
be
impractical,
not
to
have
informed
the
plaintiff
that
he
ought
to
be
looking
for
something.
he
might
discover
10
years
after
the
last
predicate
act
happened,
or
10
years
after
the
injury
had
occurred
he
might
have
learned
that
he
was
injured,
but
until
he
comes
into
possession
of
knowledge
that
the
injury
is
caused
by
a
pattern
of
racketeering,
he
doesn't
know
of
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action.
and
then
it
is
merely
a
question
of
whether
the
courts
would
allow
the
plaintiff
to
undertake
some
sort
of
an
equitable
tolling
and
start
the
statute
of
limitations
over
again,
and
again,
congress
has
resolved
that
concern
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
who
must
undertake
a
diligent
discovery
within
a
known
4-year
period,
rather
than
saying
the
courthouse
door
is
closed
and
the
plaintiff,
if
he
gets
lucky,
might
later
on
be
able
to
reopen
that
door.
and
so
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it
seems
that
the
court
ought
to
take
that
into
consideration
on
the
front
end,
rather
than
hoping
that
on
some
sort
of
chance,
or
on
some
sort
of
a
possibility
that
later
on
the
plaintiff
will
be
able
to
get
into
court,
that
the
doctrine
would
work
through
an
equitable
tolling
principle.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
your
honor,
our
client
would
have
no
cause
of
action.
how
would
he
know
that
simply
by
paying
the
doctors'
bills,
that
they
were
taking
that
money
out
of
his
insurance
policy
until
it
was...
until
it
was
rendered
empty,
until
it
was
finished,
and
that
he
was
paying
those
insurance
benefits
to
the
doctors
not
because
they
were
treating
him
for
legitimate
reasons,
but
because
they
wanted
to
bilk
out
the
insurance
policy.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
well,
certainly
the
latent
injury
cases,
or
the
foreign
object
cases
would
encompass
that,
but
in
this
case
what
you
essentially
have
is--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--no,
it
wouldn't.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
fraud
situation
where
the
plaintiff
is
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
going
along,
being
treated,
paying
bills.
he
does
not
know,
nor
could
he
know,
that
that
is
being
done
fraudulently,
or
that
that
is
being
done
to
him
because--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
not
for
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
that
the
plaintiff
would
want
to
undertake.
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
fraud
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
as
soon
as
he
discovers
the
fraud.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
he
would
have
a
state
cause
of
action,
yes,
for
fraud,
when
he
discovers--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--and
then
he
would
have
also--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--well,
then--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--well,
first,
at
that
point,
when
he
discovers
the
fraud
he'd
have
a
certain
4-year
period
in
which
to
bring
the
cause
of
action.
but
secondly,
in
the
clayton
act
example
that
your
honor
is
referring
to,
the
clayton
act
plaintiff,
if
he
were
injured
again,
or
if
the
clayton
act
conspiracy
were
working
to
its
best
efforts
and
had
injured
him
again,
he
would
get
a
cause
of
action
upon
each
injury.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--well--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--it
matters
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
always
said
those
sorts
of
doctrines
are
very
limited,
very
narrow
exceptions
to
the
limitations
accrual
rules,
and
they
are
available,
as
this
court
said
in
the
irwin
case,
only
very
sparingly;
only
in
very
limited
circumstances
do
they
apply.
the
fraudulent
concealment
equitable
estoppel,
equitable
tolling
distinction
in
that
regard
makes
no
difference.
i--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--there
was
some
affirmative
concealment,
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
affirmative
concealment
kept
the
plaintiff
from
discovering
it,
that
could
be
read
as
either
a
fraud
case
or
a
fraudulent
concealment
case.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
that
sort
of
a
doctrine
wouldn't
work
well
for
rico.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
that's
correct,
it
wouldn't
help
us,
because
certainly
in
mr.
rotella's
case
there
was
no
affirmative
conduct
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
were
taking
money
from
him.
there
was
an
attempt,
however,
later
on
to
say
that
they
had
no--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--concealing
the
wrongdoing,
which
we
say
cannot
be
uncoupled
in
the
case
of
rico
from
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
this
court
has
said,
in
the
malley-duff
opinion,
that
the
pattern
of
racketeering
is
the
heart
of
any
rico
complaint.
in
the
h.j.
inc.
case
this
court
said--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--we
say
because--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--as
judge
posner
has
analyzed
those
cases,
and
as
this
court
cited
in
his
opinion
in
the
cada
case,
which
was
quoted
in
klehr,
there
has
to
be,
in
the
case
of
fraudulent
concealment,
some
sort
of
affirmative
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
now,
let's
take
this
case
and
look
at
the
practicalities
of
how
that
might
work.
let's
suppose
that
for
some
reason
mr.
rotella
had
discovered
before
1990,
or
had
suspected
before
1990
that
he
might
have
some
sort
of
a
rico
case,
and
he
had
walked
into
a
lawyer's
office
and
sat
down
and
said,
you
know,
i
think
my
doctors
are
taking
money
from
me
in
furtherance
of
a
criminal
enterprise.
if
the
lawyer
didn't
at
first
suggest
that
he
go
back
to
the
hospital
because
of
some
paranoid
fantasy,
he
might
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
draft
a
complaint,
but
what
would
he
allege?
how
could
he
allege
that
fraud
with
particularity?
how
would
he
know
any
facts
that
would
get
him
past
a
rule
11
sanctions
motion,
or
a
12(b)(6)
motion--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--but
he
ought
not
to
be
penalized
if
he
did
not
really
know,
nor
could
have
known
of
the
existence
of
the
particular
acts--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--if
the--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--if
that
happened,
then
he'd
be
into
a
4-year
accrual
period
which
would
start
with
the
release
of
that
criminal
guilty
plea
1
day
before
he
walked
into
the
lawyer's
office.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
but
only
if,
under
fraudulent
concealment,
he
could
also
show,
or
somehow
find
out
that
the
defendants
had
been
affirmatively
doing
things.
if
he
walked
into
the--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--defendant's
office
and
said,
doctor,
i
think
you're
stealing
money
from
me,
and
the
doctor
said,
no
i
am
not,
you're
really
sick,
you
deserve
to
be
in
the
hospital.
that
sort
of
conduct
is
what
the
cada
opinion
says
is
required
for
fraudulent
concealment.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
at
the
outset
put
to
rest
any
notion
that
we
brought
this
claim
to
recover
mr.
rotella's
personal
effects,
because
this
case
is
not
about
recovering
his
tennis
shoes
or
his
blue
jeans
that
were
taken
from
him
when
he
checked
into
the
hospital.
this
case
is
about
whether
rico
is
a
supplemental
remedy
in
addition
to
state
tort
causes
of
action,
and
it
is
about
whether
this
court
will
adhere
to
the
traditional
recovery
rule
that
injury
plus
its
cause
must
be
known
before
the
cause
of
action
accrues,
and
it
is
thirdly
about
whether
equitable
tolling
will
apply,
and
that's
the
point
at
which
i'd
like
to
begin
my
remarks.
because
equitable
tolling
is
supposed
to
be
only
the
exception
and
not
the
rule,
if,
in
fact,
equitable
tolling
becomes
the
doctrine
on
which
plaintiffs
rely
in
every
rico
case,
then
it
is
no
longer
the
exception,
it
is
the
core
rico
case.
this
is
a
core
rico
case,
where
the
plaintiff
did
not
know
and
could
not
have
known
of
the
existence
of
a
rico
injury
until
the
federal
indictments
were
announced.
so
if
you
have
plaintiffs
pleading
in
every
case--
mr.
richard
p.
hogan,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
it
would
only
narrow
the
plaintiff's
ability
to
take
advantage
of
that
doctrine.
what
we
submit
is
that
plaintiffs
will
be
pleading
this
right
and
left
to
get
into
court,
because
they
will
not
be
able
to
discover
the
inherently
secretive
and
concealed
nature
of
the
rico
enterprises
that
they
claim
have
been
the
perpetrators
of
the
pattern
of
racketeering,
and
if
those
things
are
secretive
by
nature,
and
plaintiffs
must
often
plead
the
equitable
tolling
doctrine,
then
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
incorporate
the
knew-or-should-have-known
standard
of
equity
within
the
accrual
rule
itself,
and
then
give
everybody
a
predictable
4-year
limitations
period
in
which
to
bring
suit.
the
defendants
have
argued
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
ability,
there
is
no
problem
of
practicality,
that
plaintiffs
would
not
have
a
problem
simply
pleading
a
rico
claim,
going
and
doing
discovery,
and
finding
out
the
existence
of
the
enterprise,
but,
of
course,
what
would
be
the
first
response
of
every
defendant
should
a
plaintiff
plead
that
sort
of
a
claim?
it
would
be,
your
honor,
the
plaintiff
is
engaging
in
a
fishing
expedition.
there
is
no
related
claim
to
this,
and
there
is
only
a
fishing
expedition
to
try
and
find
a
rico
claim.
we
submit
that
the
court
ought
to
decline
the
invitation
to
reconstitute
the
civil
rico
cause
of
action
in
the
guise
of
adopting
and
defining
a
limited
accrual
rule,
and
that
this
court
ought
to
recognize
that
the
distinctive
nature
of
rico
is
its
pattern
requirement,
without
which
there
is
no
rico
claim,
and
to
that
extent,
should
the
court
recognize
that
the
pattern
element
is
the
core
of
rico
and
that
equitable
doctrines
must
be
incorporated
within
the
rule
itself,
we
submit
that
the
court
therefore
ought
to
reverse
and
remand
this
case.
