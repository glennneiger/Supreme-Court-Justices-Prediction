justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
you'd
then
have
to
have
a...
a
second
election
under
the
ninth
circuit's
view
even
though
only
two
people
were
running
in
the
first
place
and
it'd
be
among
the
same
two
people.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose
under
the
respondents'
theory...
well,
i
can
ask
respondent...
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it...
it
could
be
that
1,000
people
were
very
interested
in
the
school
board,
and
a
different
1,000
were
very
interested
in
the
water
bonds.
so,
you'd
have
to,
i
take
it,
count
those
people...
multiply
the
sum
of
those
people,
to
get
the
number
of
ballots
cast
in
the
election
as
the
respondents--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
any
cases
you've
found
where
if...
if
there's
fraud
in
one
contest,
governor...
for
the
governor,
that
the...
the
entire
ballot
is
thrown
out
for
all
other
issues?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
stevens'
initial
question
was
why
should
the
universe
be
different
in...
in
the
recall
and
the
number
of
people
who
have
to
vote
to
put
the
governor
in
office
to
begin
with.
what...
what
would
be
the
sense
of
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
universe
is
different
in
your
view.
it's
the
same
in
petitioners'
view.
am
i
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
universe
is
different
in
your
view,
the
same
in
petitioners'
view.
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
isn't
the
answer
that
in
that
runoff
election,
the
requirement
is
that
the
position
goes
to
the
person
who
has
the
highest
vote?
there
is
no
majority
requirement
in
the
runoff
election.
