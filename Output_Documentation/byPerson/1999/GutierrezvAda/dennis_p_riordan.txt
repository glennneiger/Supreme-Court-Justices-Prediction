mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
ada
would
be
the
first
to
concede
that
congress
could
have
written
a
statute
that
required
only
a
majority
of
those
who
voted
for
governor
as
opposed
to
a
majority
of
those
who
participated
in
the
general
election.
had
it
intended
to
do
so,
it
would
have
used
language
that
it
has
used,
as
justice
scalia
recognized,
in
other
statutes
dealing
with
elections
in
guam.
i'll
return
to
that
point
in
a
minute.
but
i
want
to
begin,
where
we
always
must
begin
in
cases
of
statutory
interpretation,
with
the
statute
itself.
and
i
want
to
begin
with
a
critical
subject
about
which
my
opponent
has
said
nothing,
which
is
the
first
sentence
that
defines
a
majority.
that
first
sentence--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--your
honor,
i'm
at...
i'm
going
to
refer
to
the
second
sentence
of
the
statute.
the
statute
can
be
found
at
page
2
of
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--cert
petition
or...
or
of
the
blue
brief.
and
the
second
sentence
is...
of
the
statute
is
the
first
that
deals
with
the
question
of
a
majority.
and
it
reads,
the
governor
of
guam,
together
with
the
lieutenant
governor,
shall
be
elected
by
a
majority
of...
of
the
votes
cast...
and
here's
the
critical
language...
by
the
people
who
are
qualified
to
vote
for
members
of
the
legislature
of
guam.
let's
stop
right
there.
that
is
our
first
definition
of
majority,
and
it
compels
the
question,
how
many
people
qualified
to
vote
for
members
of
the
legislature
of
guam
cast
votes
in
the
november
3rd,
1998
general
election?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
true,
but
it
is
the
definition
of
a
majority.
and
we
know
this.
the...
the
number
of
people
qualified
to
vote
for
the
legislature
who
voted
in
the
general
election
is
easily
ascertained.
it
is
48,666.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
your
honor,
i
simply...
but...
but
my
point
would
be
this.
congress
could
have
resolved
this
question
dispositively
in
favor
of
the
petition...
the
position
of
petitioners
by
simply
adding
the
words,
in
the
gubernatorial
election.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
your...
your
honor--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--the...
the
reason
it
is
not
is
that...
is
that
we
agree
that...
that
after
cass
and...
and
there
is
no
case
in
this
country
that,
absent
a
very
specific
statutory
provision,
says
that...
that
the
relevant
universe
is...
is
eligible
voters
including
those
who
stay
at
home.
but
congress
made
clear
that
it
wasn't
talking
about
eligible
voters,
all
the
eligible
voters.
it
was
talking
about
the
eligible
voters
who
cast
votes.
but...
but
had
we
had
the
term,
for
the
office
of
governor,
the
ambiguity
would
be
resolved,
and
we
do
know
that...
that
congress
has
resolved
this
very
ambiguity
in
two
places
related
to
this
statute:
one
in
1422(a),
which
was
passed
on
the
same
day.
it
dealt
with
the
question
of
how
many
votes
you
need
to
recall
a
governor.
and
it
stated
that
you
need--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--1422(a),
your
honor,
is
found
at...
in
the
beginning
of
the
respondents'
brief
on
the
merits
at
page
2
i
believe.
at
page...
in
our...
yes,
in
our...
1
and
2
of...
of
our
statutes
at
issue.
and
1422(a)
uses
the
language
that,
in
order
to
recall
the
governor,
you
must
have
two
thirds
of
the
number
of
the
people
voting
for
governor
in
the
last
preceding
election.
so,
congress
there
very
explicitly
resolved
any
ambiguity
by...
by
saying
that
when
it
was
talking
about
two
thirds,
as
opposed
to
a
majority,
it
was
talking
about
two
thirds
of
the
people
voting
for
governor
in
the
last
preceding
election.
had
it
taken
those
words,
voting
for
governor,
which
are
found
in
1422(a),
and
put
them
in
1422,
it
would
have
resolved
this
matter
in
favor
of
petitioners'
petition.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
your
honor,
the
reason--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
a...
the
policy
that
suggests
itself
is
that
once
a
governor
is...
is
elected,
the
specific
number
of
votes
that...
that
were
involved
in
electing
him
shall
constitute
the...
the
frame
of
reference
if
you're
going
to
have
to
recall
him.
it's...
it's
those...
you
want
to
make
sure
that...
that
you
have
a...
a
number
that
isn't
simply
a
majority,
but
a
super
majority,
to
recall
a...
an
official.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
the...
the
reason
that
isn't...
isn't...
well,
the...
two
thirds...
i
cannot
mathematically
imagine
a
situation
in
which
two
thirds
of
the
number
who
actually
vote
for
governor
are
a...
a
smaller
number
than
a...
a
majority
of
all
of
those--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right,
but...
but
if
60,000
vote
for
governor--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--your
honor,
right.
it
takes
51,000
to...
to
elect
him.
but
they
have...
i
mean,
these
two
statutes
were
passed
as...
as
part
of
a
package,
1422
and
1422(a).
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
you're...
you're
requiring
a
super...
well,
the
universe
isn't
different,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
it's...
it's
that
you
are
going
to
require
a
majority
of
all
who...
who
participate
in
the
election.
well,
the
two
thirds
majority
is
going
to
be--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
yes.
the...
the
universe
is
different.
the
universe
is
different
because
the
terminology
is
different.
but...
but
the
rule
of
this
court
has
been,
as
in
the
bates
case,
that...
we
were
dealing
there
with
statutes
on
student
loans,
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
argued
that
an
intent
to
defraud
element
can
be
found
in
the...
in
a
particular
statute,
1097.
and
the
court
noted
that
1097(d)
expressly
included
that
intent
to
defraud
element.
and
it...
it
said
that
you
cannot
have
the
express
inclusion
by
congress
of
an
element
in
one
part,
its
omission
from
a
related
part,
and...
and
assume
that
congress
meant
the
same
rule
to
apply
or
same
language
to
apply
to
both
because,
as...
as
the
court
said,
where
congress
includes
particular
language
in
one
section
of
a
statute,
but
omits
it
in
another
section
of
the
statute,
it
is
generally
presumed
that
congress
acts
intentionally
and
purposefully
in
the
disparate
inclusion
or
exclusion.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
that's--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that's...
that's
absolutely
not
the
case,
your
honor,
because
the...
the
rule
of...
we
don't
have
the
question
of
how
you
would
run
a
runoff
before
the
court.
it's
obviously
of
interest
to
it
in
dealing
with
the
question
dealing
with
the
general
election.
but
a
runoff
is
a
special
election,
your
honor,
and
under
the
law
that
we've
cited,
a
special
election
is
not
subject--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
by...
by
the
statutory
provision
itself,
the
runoff
is
supposed
to
be
held
within
2
weeks
of
the
general
election.
it
is...
it
is
most
assuredly
a
special
election.
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i...
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
other
election
that
is...
is
subjected
to
the
provisions
of
1422.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
it...
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that,
you
know,
the
relevant
language
is
the
language
which
says
when
the
runoff
will
occur,
and
the
runoff
will
occur
on
the
14th
day
thereafter.
now,
the...
the
election
of
the
governor
has
to
happen
on
the...
on
the
general
election
which
by
statute
is
the
first
tuesday
after
the
first
monday
in
november.
so,
any...
any
election
held
in...
in
mid
november
is
by
definition
a...
a
special
election
because
a
general
election
is
defined
by
guam
law
as
only
that
election
which
takes
place
on
the
first
tuesday
after
the
first
monday
in...
in
november.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
that's...
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
it's...
it's
a
race
between
two
people.
write
ins
don't...
write
ins
are
meaningless
in...
in
a
runoff.
there
aren't...
write
ins
aren't
permissible
because
a
runoff
is
a
runoff
between
two
candidates.
so,
if
someone
wrote
in,
it
would
not
count.
a
blank
ballot--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
i...
i
suppose
theoretically
they...
they
could
tie,
but
that...
that
would
happen--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--but
a--
[laughter]
again,
the
english
teacher
reappears.
under...
under
the
statute...
under
the
wema
rule,
the...
the
general
american
rule
is
that
this
rule
that
we
are
proposing
that
certainly
was
stated
in
many
cases
that
you
require
a
majority
of
all
those
who
participate
in
the
general
election,
that
is
a
rule
that
does
not
apply
to
special
elections.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
let
me...
let
me
answer
that
question
very
precisely.
does
any
of
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
involve
application
of
this
rule
to
the
election
of
a
candidate?
no.
are
there
cases
that
involve
this
rule...
applying
this
rule
to
the
application
of
a...
to...
to
a
race
involving
a
candidate?
the
arizona
case
of
maxwell
v.
fleming,
166
pacific
2d,
involves
that
at
831,
which
in
turn
relied
on
a
hawaii
case
applying
the
same
rule
to
a
primary
election.
so,
the...
the
cases
are
rare.
it...
it
is
a
far
more
common
situation
to
have
a
proposition
on
which
you
may
get
a
majority,
5,000
to
2,000,
but
there's
10,000
people
that
don't
understand
the
proposition.
many
time
you
have
20
complicated--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
so,
the
rule
is
clear
as
to
propositions,
but
it
is
applied
in
maxwell
v.
fleming.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
that
holds
that
this
is
a
rule
that
only
applies
to--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
both
agree
that
if
the
language
of
the
statute
reflects
that
choice
by
congress,
it
is
not
for
us
to
say
that
the
policy
inherently
is
wrong.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
here
is
why
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not.
it
is
correct
that
propositions
are
more
likely
to
be
baffling.
there
are
likely
to
be
more
people
ignorant
of
it,
and
you
could
apply
a
rule
that
says
we
want
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
informed
majority
and
not
simply
an
informed
minority
that
votes
on
this,
so
we're
going
to
require
a
majority
of
those
who
come
to
the
election.
but
the
same
rule
applies
and
the
same
policy
whether...
if
it
is
the
case
that
neither
candidate
inspires
enough
interest
or
voters
feel
sufficiently
informed
about
either
candidate,
that
there
is
some
number...
maybe
it's
10,
maybe
it's
100,000...
who
don't
feel
qualified
to
cast
a
vote
there--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--your...
your
honor,
i...
i
am
reluctant
to
refer
to
the
city
in
which
i
practice
law
as
an
example
for
this
court,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
6
weeks
ago
a
run
in
candidate...
a
write
in
candidate
wound
up
forcing
a...
a...
an
election,
a
runoff
election,
in
that...
in
san
francisco,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
there
has
been
a
heightened
period
of
scrutiny,
there
has
been
additional
debates,
there's
been
a...
a
much
higher
level
of
press
and
public
attention
to
the
race
than
existed
in
the
original
race.
and
congress
could
say,
we
opt
for
that
kind
of
security.
if
you
as
a
candidate
can't
get
50
percent
of
the
people
who
are
clearly
involved
enough
to
show
up
and
vote,
we're
going
to
force
this
heightened
period
of
scrutiny
that
happens
in
runoff
campaigning.
and...
and
it
is
true...
it
is
true
that
it's
the
same
two
candidates,
but...
but
it
is
very
clear
that
congress
made
that
choice
because,
as...
as
petitioners
concede,
if
you
had
100,000
votes
and
one
candidate
had...
had,
you
know,
49,999
and
the
other
had
all
the
other
votes
except
for
10
and
there
were
10
write
in
ballots,
there
is
no
question...
and
they
concede...
that
you'd
have
to
have
a
runoff
between
the
two
candidates.
there
would
not
be
a
majority.
everyone
agrees
that
write
in
candidate
votes
have
to
be
counted
in
the
relevant
universe.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
it
is
the
position
of
the
guam
election
commission
that
they
are.
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
absolutely
not.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
your...
your
honor,
the...
the
guam
election
commission...
let
me
be
clear
about
the
history...
included...
there
are
609
overvotes
marked
for
both
candidates.
they
included
all
of
those.
there
are
1,294
write
in
ballots.
and
there
are
1,313
blank
ballots
for
the
governor's
race.
justice
ginsburg
is
correct
that
you
need
to
include
all
three
categories
in
order
for
petitioners'
candidate
to
not
have
a
majority.
if...
if
you
did
not
include
blank
ballots,
if
you
did
not
include
spoiled
ballots,
if
you
did
not
include
write
in
ballots,
then...
then
petitioners'
candidate
would
have
a
majority.
the
guam
election
commission
included
spoiled
ballots
and
they
included
all
write
in
ballots.
there
was
no
challenge
to
that
in
the
district
court.
they
came
up
with
the
number
47,353
as
opposed
to
48,666.
so,
the
only--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
but
the...
the
term
majority
is
not
used
to
refer
to
the
runoff
election,
and...
and
i...
as
i
say,
this
question
is
not
before
the
court.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
different
rules
apply
to
this
runoff
than
traditionally
apply
to
runoffs.
in
runoffs,
only
two
candidates
count.
write
ins
don't
count
in
a...
in
a
runoff.
you
can
write
in
as
many
people
as
you
want.
a
write
in
candidate
could
have
a
majority.
he
would
not
win
the
runoff
because
a
runoff
is
limited
to...
to
a
race
between
two
candidates
and
the
person
who
gets
the
highest
vote
wins.
it's
a
special
election,
and
the
majority
requirement
just
simply
wouldn't
apply.
so,
there
wouldn't
be
an
infinite
number.
a
runoff
always
produces
a
winner
except,
as...
as
the
chief...
mr.
chief
justice
pointed
out,
you
could
have
a
tie,
but...
but
that
is...
that
is
a
problem
that
is
not
dealt
with
or
resolved
by
any
resolution
of
this
case.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that...
the
language
of
the
two
statutes
is...
is
the
same.
we
do,
as...
as
mr.
hufstedler
has
pointed
out,
have
a
different
provision
when
you
come
to
the
race
for
delegates
because
they
have...
they...
for
whatever
reasons,
they
have
different
ballot
requirements
now
for
one
or
the
other.
but
1712,
to
bring
us
to
the
delegate
statute,
is
critically
important.
i
mean,
that
is
a
statute
that
expressly
says
that
you're
to
be
elected
by
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
for
delegate.
i
mean,
it
is
language
that
is
clear.
it
is
unambiguous.
it
is--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--but
i
would
simply
submit,
though,
your
honor...
i...
i
submit
1712
only
as
an
example
of
the
fact
that...
that
when
dealing
with
a
related
subject,
congress
clearly
knows
how
to
spell
out
a
majority
requirement
that
deals
only
with
a
particular
office,
that
is,
or
votes
cast
for
a
particular
office.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
let
me
deal
with
the
last
one
last.
it's
the
easiest
to
remember,
and
then
you
can
remind
me
of
the
others.
as
the
district
court
opinion
points
out,
blank
ballots
have
been
included
by
the
guam
election
commission
in
two
prior
elections.
so,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that...
that
what
they
did
in
this
case
and...
and
i
think
it's...
it's
very
clear
that
this
was
a
highly
politicized
battle
in
the
guam
election
commission.
the
documents
before
the
court
reflect
that,
that...
that
the...
the
exclusion
of
blank
ballots
actually
was
a
deviation
from
their
prior
practice.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
i...
i
think,
given
the
factual
finding
of...
of
the
district
court,
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
what
you
would
defer
to.
do
you
defer
to
past
practice
or
to
the
deviation
from
it
here?
secondly,
i
mean,
the
problem
with...
with...
i
would
agree...
i
would
agree
that
there
is
a
much
more
appealing
symmetry
if
the
delegate
statute
and
the
governor
statute
are...
contain
the
same
language
and...
and
the
same
principle
and
the
same
definition
of
a
majority.
the
problem
is
that
we
have
to
include
language
in
the...
in
the
governor
statute
that
doesn't
exist,
which
was
very
expressly
put
in
the
delegate
statute.
so,
it's...
it's
symmetrical.
it's
appealing,
but
it
would
be,
i...
i
would
submit,
a
result
of...
of
judges
deciding
that...
that
it's
a
more
attractive
principle,
although
it
isn't
the
one
that
the
legislature
chose
to
embody
in
the
statutory
language.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i'm
tempted
to
refer
to
thailand
on
the...
on
the
grounds
that
i'm
unlikely
to
be
contradicted--
[laughter]
--by...
by
opposing
counsel.
i
can't
say
that...
that
i
do,
your
honor.
i
want
to...
i
did
want
to
make
a
point
about...
about
the
prior
law,
the
law
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
passed
because
that's
obviously
one
of
the
considerations.
congress
is...
is
assumed
to...
to
know
it.
let's
make
a
concession.
we
both
say
that
the
law
favors
us,
that
there
are
more
cases
which
say
that...
that
you...
you
require
a
majority
of
all
those
who
attend
the
general
election.
the
petitioners
have
a
different
view.
at
a
minimum,
congress,
if
we
assume
they
knew
that
law,
knew
that
this
was
a
hot
issue.
it...
it
knew
that
there
had
been
a
century
of
litigation
about
what
a
majority
means.
and
given
that
there's
been
a
century
of
litigation
about
what
a
majority
means,
petitioners
are
saying
if
you
just
insert
some
language
in
there
that
congress
must
have
inadvertently
omitted,
although
it's
in
other
statutes...
it's
in
1422,
it's
in
1712...
if
you
just
stick
it
in
there,
it's
clear
and...
and
it's
appealing.
but
given
that
congress
knew
that
this
was
a
delicate
issue,
we
can't
assume
that
it
was
omitted
in
any
way--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--your
honor,
there
are
those
who
say
that
this
entire
area
of...
of
rules
of
statutory
construction
that
we
employ
is...
is
an
engagement
in
a
fiction,
and
there
are
those
who
say,
but
it's
a
more
appealing
fiction
than
attempting
to
divine
statutory
history
and
legislative
history.
[laughter]
so,
i...
i
will--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
perhaps
the...
the
final
point
that
i'll
make
is
just
one
that...
that
it
is
puzzling.
i...
i
will
admit
that
the
toughest
question
that
can
be
asked
to
me
is
congress
did
not
write
in
the
language
that
makes
it
clear
that
petitioners
should
prevail.
i
think
that's
clear.
they
could
have.
they
used
it
in
other
statutes.
i
would
have
to
concede
that
they
did
not
spell
out
the
statute
in
a
way
that
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
a
majority
means
a
majority
of
all
those
who...
who
attended
and
participated
in
the
general
election.
i
just
think
that
we're
closer
to
it.
i
think
that
the
first
sentence,
which
says
a
majority
of
votes
cast
by
qualified
citizens,
standing
alone
comes
closer
to
our
position
than
it
does
to
petitioners'.
i
think
that
the
statement,
in
any
election,
comes
closer
to
our
petition...
position
because
it
doesn't
say
in
any
gubernatorial
election.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
they...
they...
i...
i...
because
one
of
them...
because
the
statutory
language,
i
submit,
justice
ginsburg,
approaches
and
is
much
closer
to
our
definition
than
it
is
theirs.
it
does
not
require
the
insertion
of
language
that
it
isn't...
isn't
there.
it
does
require
in
the
context
of
the
statute
defining
votes
and
ballots
interchangeably,
but
that
is
something
that
perhaps,
if
they're
not
interchangeable
in
every
context,
they
are
very,
very
frequently
interchangeable,
as...
as
resort
to
the...
the
dictionary
definition
shows.
and
we
finally
submit
that
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
the
most
popular
baseball
player
in
chicago
should
be
elected
by
a
vote
of
all
of
those
who
attend
major
league
baseball
games,
you
would
not
use
that
language
if
you
intended
the
vote
to
be
limited
to
those
who
are
fans
of
the
cubs.
