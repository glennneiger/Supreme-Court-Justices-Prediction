mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
mr.
chief
justice...
excuse
me...
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
us
this
morning
is
whether
guam
has
already
elected
its
current
governor
or
whether
there
must
be
a
runoff
election,
and
that
depends,
as
you
well
know,
on
whether
a
majority
is
determined
by
counting
the
votes
which
have
been
cast
in
the
gubernatorial
race
or
whether,
according
to
the
respondents
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
should
could
all
of
the
ballots
which
were,
in
fact,
issued
in
the
general
election,
along
at
the
same
time,
and
then
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
majority.
the
net
result
of
going
along
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
decided
and
what
the
respondents
contend
is
that
there
are
three
suspect
categories
of
votes
which
would
be
included
in
determining
what
constitutes
a
majority
that
were
not
votes
cast
in
the
gubernatorial
race
for
one
candidate.
the
first
was
1,313
ballots
on
which
there
was
no
vote
for
the
governor
at
all.
the
second
was
609
ballots
which
were
invalid
because
the
voter
voted
for
both
slates,
contrary
to
the
statutes
of
guam,
and
it
was
impossible
to
determine
their
choice.
and
then
there
was
a
third
category
of
1,019
votes
on
which
the
voter
checked
the
box
saying
that
the
voter
wanted
to
vote
for
a
write
in
candidate,
but
then
didn't
write
in
a
candidate.
so,
another
1,000
ballots
which
were,
in
effect...
in
effect,
blank
ballots
in...
in
the
race
for
governor.
but
on
those
ballots
presumably...
the
record
doesn't
show...
but
presumably
people
turned
in
ballots
on
which
they
had
voted
in
other
races,
but
not
the
gubernatorial
race
at
all.
the
net
result
of
all
of
those
votes
was
that
the
gutierrez
slate
received
some
24,250
votes
and
the
ada
slate
received
21,200.
so,
there
was
a--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--the...
the
governing
statute
1422?
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
in...
the
statute
is
quoted
in
the
blue
brief,
in
the
initial
brief,
on
the
statutes
involved,
and
it's
also
quoted
in
the
initial
argument.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
statute
is
first
shown
on
page
2,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
and
that's
the
one
in
the
opening
brief
and
that
governs
it.
so,
the
net
result
is
there
was
something
like
a
3,000
vote
margin,
which
is
really
quite
a
comfortable
margin
in
many
elections
which
are
so
close
these
days.
here,
if
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
respondents
are
correct,
the
result
is
going
to
change
in
determining
a...
it
will
change
in
this
case,
but
can
change
in
any
case
depending
upon
how
enthusiastic
many
people
are
about
coming
in
and
voting
for
the
school
board
members,
grass
roots
kind
of
campaigns
which
will
bring
in
a
lot
of
people,
or
the
legislature.
and
if
that
brings
in
a
lot
of
people
to
vote
in
those
two
races,
then
the...
the
barrier
becomes
much
higher
as
to
how
many
votes
somebody
has
to
get
to
be
elected
governor.
and
that's
a
nonsensical
kind
of
proposition.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
absolutely
and
specifically,
that's
exactly
what
they
said,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
be
happy
to,
your
honor.
that
case
was
set,
as
i
think
the
footnote
indicates...
had
been
set
to
be
argued
last
week,
or
at
least
the
last
week
of
november,
and
that
was
continued
over
to
the
next
session,
which
presumably
will
be
in
february
in
guam,
awaiting
apparently
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
two...
two
basic
sets
of
issues.
the
first
issue
is
precisely
this
issue,
and
the
court...
trial
court
in
guam
decided,
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
that
you
looked
at
the
votes
cast
in
the
gubernatorial
election.
the
second
set
of
issues
were
a
bunch
of
issues
related
to
claimed
fraud
in
connection
with
the
election.
and
that
took
many
days
of
trial,
and
with
very
extensive
opinion
by
the
trial
judge,
the
trial
judge
found
no
proof
whatsoever
of
any
kind
of
misconduct.
and
those
are
the
issues
on
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
in
guam.
now,
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
at
all
to
suggest
that
the
determination
of
the...
of
the
majority
should
depend
upon
what
happens
in
some
other
elections.
you
all
recall
well
that
this
argument
is
based
primarily
on
an
assertion
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
now
by
the
respondents
that
if
the
phrase,
in
any
election,
really
means
in
any
gubernatorial
election,
then
it's...
it's
duplicitous.
surplus
was
the
word.
they
used
the
word
twice.
surplus
and
nullity.
and
therefore,
the
interesting
proposition
is
that
sub
silentio
the
respondent
in
the
ninth
circuit
concedes
that
if
the
phrase,
in
any
election,
was
not
in
that
statute,
the
statute
means
in
any
gubernatorial
election.
it
can't
be
surplus
unless
the
statute
already
says
that.
then
the
statute
says,
in
any
election.
and
they
say,
well,
that
means
any
gubernatorial
election.
the
statute
already
means
that
and
it
can't
mean
that,
and
so
we
have
to
throw
all
of
this
out,
even
though
it
said
it
twice,
and
go
find
some
different
kind
of
election
that's
going
to
determine
this.
and
they
determined
now,
as
you
know,
that
it
was
the
specific
general
election
in
which
the
gubernatorial...
of
which
the
gubernatorial
election
was
a
part.
it
was
that
election.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
first
proposition
i
think,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
authority
whatsoever
for
the
proposition
that
a
non
vote
is
something
that
should
be
counted
in
an
election.
i
find
no
authority
anyplace.
there's
none
in
any
brief.
there's
none
in
any
opinion.
it's
true
that
you
can
argue
that--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--precisely.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
precisely
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
term
vote
cast
is
used
several
times
in
the
statute.
there's
never
any
mention
of
the
word
ballot
in
the
statute.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
it
clearly
is.
i
would
certainly
insist
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
of
course,
as
i
said,
there's
no
place
where
they
talk
about
ballots,
only
about
votes
cast.
but
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
asked
about
voting
for
donald
duck,
i'd
call
to
your
attention
the...
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
1997,
the
foster
case,
in
which
the
court
was
obligated
to
define
what
an
election
is.
it
involved
a
louisiana
primary
and
the
question
was
whether
the
federal
statutes
fixing
a
date
had
fixed
it
so
that
you
couldn't
have
a,
quote,
election
really
prior
to
that
in
the
primary
that
determined
the
result.
and
here's
what
justice
souter
said
in
that
case,
quoting
from
page
71.
when
the
federal
statutes
speak
of,
quote,
the
election,
unquote,
of
a
senator
or
representative,
they
plainly
referred
to
the
continued
actions
of
the
voters
and
the
officials
meant
to
make
a
final
selection
of
an
officeholder.
now,
that's
a
key
question.
we're...
when
we
say
election,
we're
talking
about
a
single
election
in
a
contest
to
determine
who
is
going
to
be
that
officeholder.
it
isn't...
we're
not
talking
about
a
general
election
someplace.
we're
talking
about
that
specific
election.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say...
well,
i
think
it
doesn't
add
further.
it
quotes
the
american
dictionary
defining
election
as,
quote,
the
act
of
choosing
a
person
to
fill
an
office.
and
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
absolutely.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
absolutely.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
perfectly
appropriate
question,
and
it
might
very
well
be
the
same.
i
would
certainly
argue
that
if
the
phrase,
in
any
election,
weren't
there,
the
only
logical
answer
is
that
it
means
that
you
count
those
votes
in
the
gubernatorial
election.
and,
of
course,
that's
precisely
what
the
ninth
circuit
assumed.
it
would
never
be
surplus
if
that
weren't
the
case,
but--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--thank
you.
but
it
isn't...
it
isn't
entirely
surplus.
it
does
add
something.
what
it
says,
and
it
says
very
clearly,
is
in
any
gubernatorial
election,
you
will
use
this
standard,
that
there
must
be
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
in
that
election.
and
what
it
adds
is
this.
the
ninth
circuit
argued
that
we
were
really
looking
only
at
a
single
election.
we
were
looking
at
that
one
election
at
which
everything
was
included,
and
therefore
that
specific
election
was
the
one.
that
reads
out
the
word
any.
what
this
says
in
any
is,
in
any
election,
the
first
one
in
1970,
which
is
included
in
the
statute,
or
any
election
quadrennially,
4
years
after,
in
any
one
of
those
elections...
there
have
now
been
eight,
and
presumably
they
will
go
on
indefinitely.
in
any
one
of
those
elections
every
4
years,
you
apply
this
standard.
now,
that's
not
said
in
the
statute
anyplace
else,
and
that's
what
this
statute
adds.
therefore,
it's
not
a
nullity.
it
says
clearly
there's
something
else
here.
in
any
election
refers
to
those
future
elections.
so,
there's
a
universe
of
them.
now,
any
requires
a
universe,
but
the
argument
of
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
out
any
argument
of
a
universe.
they
said,
we
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
ballots
returned
in
that
specific
general
election
of
which
the
gubernatorial
election
is
a
part.
now,
there's
no
universe
there.
the
word
any
is
read
out
by
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
that
would
be
14
elections
i
think--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--sure.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
understand
that.
precisely.
but
i
would
say
nobody
knows
from
this
record.
all
we
know
is
that
the
total
number
of
ballots
issued
were
46,666.
we
don't
know
how
many
people
voted
for
each
of
the
people
in
the
school
board.
you
know,
there
were
a
whole
bunch
of
candidates
for
the
school
board.
we
don't
know
how
many
people
voted
in
each
of
the
elections
for
the
legislature.
none
of
that's
in
the
record.
never...
never
appeared,
never
argued,
never
made
a
point.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
only
point
was
that
there
was
a
total
of
46,666
ballots
issued
and
whether
people
voted
on
them
or
not,
they
were
returned,
and
therefore
we
ought
to
use
that
for
a
majority.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
precisely
what
happened.
they
took
the
total.
and...
and
it
illustrates
the
point,
justice
kennedy,
that
how
many
people
voted
in
this
election
depended
on
their
enthusiasm
about
a
whole
bunch
of
other
things.
they
could
have
gotten
involved
in
a
grass
roots
campaign
about
who
was
going
to
be
on
the
school
board,
and
so
they
came
in
and
voted
for
that
race
and
they
didn't
care
who
was
governor.
we
know
1,313
didn't
care
who
was
governor.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no.
the
only
thing
i
guess
i
have
to
bear
on
that
is
there
is
a
statute
in
guam,
which
is
in
the
materials,
which
points
out
that
if...
if
a
ballot
is
invalid
because
it's
voted
improperly,
the...
in
that
race
you
don't
count
it,
but
you
still
count
the
ballot
for
other
purposes.
but
i...
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
dealt
with
that
problem,
justice
kennedy.
so,
let
me
go
back
one
last
shot
at
the
question
justice
ginsburg
asked
me
a
few
minutes
ago
because
there
is
another
case
dealing
with
somebody
who
wanted
to
vote
for
donald
duck
as
a
write
in,
and
that
was
the
hawaii
case
you
will
remember,
the
burdick
case.
and
here,
the
question
was
what
is
the
vote
about.
and
the
court
said...
and
i'm
now
at
page...
whatever...
436
of
the
u.s.
reports...
the
function
of
the
election
process
is
to
winnow
out
and
finally
reject
all
but
the
chosen
candidates.
now,
that's
what
the
foster
case
says.
that's
what
the
other
cases
say.
we're
really
trying
to
select
a
candidate
for
the
officeholder
in
a
particular
race.
not
to
provide
a
means
and
giving
vent
to,
quote,
short
range
political
goals,
pique,
or
personal
quarrels.
in
other
words,
if
a
vote
for
donald
duck
is
intended
to
say,
gee,
i
don't
like
anything
that's
going
on
here,
the
voter
can
go
out
and
say
that,
but
that's
not
a
vote
cast
and
that's
not
what
the
election
is
about.
the
election
is
about
electing
a
candidate,
and
a
vote
for
donald
duck
doesn't
do
that
and
it
doesn't
constitute
effectively
a
vote
cast.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
really
must
come
back,
as
justice
scalia
indicated
a
moment
ago,
to
deal
with
the
phrase
what
is
a
vote
cast.
and
i
would
like
to...
to
deal
specifically
with
the
response
that...
that
the
respondents
have
come
up
with
about
that
because
you
remember
they
said,
which
to
me
is
quite
an
amazing
thing,
without
any
kind
of
an
authority,
and
that
is
ballots
and
votes
are
fungible.
that's
their
word.
fungible.
there's
no
difference
between
a
ballot
and
a
vote.
now,
i
don't
think
that
proposition
has
to
be
argued
at
all.
we
all
know
what
a
ballot
is.
we
all
know
what
a
vote
is.
and
we
all
know
they
are
very
different.
and
to
illustrate
in
this
case,
the
number
of
ballots
returned
was
clearly
48,666.
the
number
of
votes
cast
in
that
general
election
was
over
a
million.
and
therefore,
if
we
count
all
the
votes
cast
in
that
general
election,
that
reaches
the
absurdity
that
everybody
has
agreed
nobody
could
have.
it
would
take
500,000
votes
to
be
a
majority
in
a
race
in
which
the
only
number
of
votes
cast
was
less
than
50,000.
so,
it
can't
mean
that.
and
clearly
also,
the
votes
cast
in
the
gubernatorial
election
were
45,535.
the
votes
cast
for
the
two
candidate
slates
and
the
275
votes
cast
for
legitimate
write
in
candidates.
those
were
the
total
votes
cast.
and
clearly
there
was
a
majority,
a
53
percent
majority,
that
the
gutierrez
slate
obtained.
now,
let
me
point
out
a
couple
things
which
illustrates
congress
knows
the
difference
between
a
vote
and
a
ballot.
if
a
congressman
or
a
congresswoman
didn't
know
the
difference
between
a
ballot
and
a
vote,
i
suspect
they
wouldn't
be
in
congress
because
they
know
that
as
well
as
anybody.
but
let
me
illustrate
it
by
looking,
for
example,
at
section
1722,
which
is
quoted
in
the
text.
it...
the
text
also
appears
on
page
19
of...
of
our
opening
brief
and
the
preceding
statute
on
the
same
subject,
1719,
appears
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
but
there
what...
this
was
a
statute
reenacted
in
1998.
i'll
tell
you
what
it
said
before
that
in
a
moment.
but
it
says,
the
delegate...
now,
we're
talking
about
delegates
now,
not...
not
the
gubernatorial
race
because,
you
remember,
the
delegates
was
one
of
the
other
races
that
was
involved
in
this
general
election.
the
delegate
from
the
virgin
islands
shall
be
elected
at
large
by
separate
ballot
by
a
majority
of
votes.
any
question
that
congress
knows
what
a
ballot
and
a
separate
ballot
is
and
what
a
vote
is?
i
mean,
they're
using
them
there
in
the
same
sentence
to
mean
obviously
different
things.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
you're
quite
right.
they
certainly
did.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--yes.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
and
i
think
that's
quite
right.
i
think
that's
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
and
they
do
say
the
votes
cast
for
the
office.
but
let
me
go
back
to
my
point
and
i'll
come
back
to
this
point.
they
know
the
difference
between
a
ballot
and
a
vote,
and
to
say
they're
fungible,
it
just
seems
to
me
to
be
an
argument
that
can
make
no
sense.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
now,
the
question
about
this
statute
also
saying,
well,
we
talked
about
the
majority
of
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
the
delegate.
sure,
it
says
that.
but
can't
you
draw
the
inference
just
as
easily
that
when
they're
talking
about
counting
a
majority,
in
general
they're
talking
about
a
majority
of
votes
for
that
office?
they
say
it
in
one
case
and
they
don't
say
it
in
another,
but
they
don't
give
you
a
different
view
either
and
that
they...
they
really
are
looking
at
what
the
votes
were
in
connection
with
that
office.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
i
think...
i
think
you're
right
about
that,
justice
breyer,
but
it
doesn't
say
it
applies
to
all
of
those
elections
until
you
put
in
the
in
any
election.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
doubt
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
doubt
it,
that
that's
what
it
means.
but
it
makes
it
clear...
and
it
says
it
clearly.
and
let
me
go
to
the
next
step.
so,
we
have
a
statute
which
we
all
think...
we
thought
applies
directly
to
this
question
of
counting
the
votes
in
the
gubernatorial
election,
and
then
we
have
a
sentence
that
says
it's
going
to
be
in
all
of
the
elections.
and
you
can
argue
a
little
bit
about
whether
that's
really
surplusage
or
not.
but
is
there
a
principle
that
says
when
you
look
at
the
context
of
the
statute
and
it
means
x,
and
then
you
have
a
sentence,
which
is
different
from
the
rest
of
the
statute,
which
also
means
x,
that
therefore
the
statute
can't
mean
x,
that
therefore
we
have
to
go
find
something
entirely
different?
it
says
it
twice.
it
ought
to
mean
it
when
it
says
it
twice.
it
isn't
a
question
of,
well,
there's
nothing
in
here
about
counting
the
votes
in
the
general
election.
but
let's
go
back
and
find
out
what
we
can
and,
boy,
let's
try
the
general
election
because
that's
different.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
you
use
the
votes
in
the
general
election,
and
that's
something
that's
just...
just
dreamed
up.
so,
the
fungibility
argument
i
think
will
not
stand,
and
the
result
is,
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
argument
falls
whether
you
approach
from
the
beginning
or
the
end.
if
you
approach
the
beginnings,
the
words
in
any
election
are
a
nullity
and
surplus.
it
seems
to
me
that
can't
read
whether...
whether
you
follow
the...
the
point
that
it
really
is
a
repetition
or
it
isn't,
it
can't
mean
that
you
come
up
with
an
entirely
different
answer.
so,
the
nullity
position
won't
stand.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
fungibility,
there's
nothing
in
here
that
says
you
count
ballots
returned.
it
says
you
count
ballots...
votes
cast.
and
therefore,
if
you're
counting
ballots...
you're
counting
votes
cast
in
the
general
election...
and
the
court
says
specifically
you
count
all
the
votes
in
the
general
election...
then
you
reach
the
absurdity.
you
have
to
have
500,000
votes
for
your
majority
and
you
don't
have
it.
so,
the
result
is
that
you
can't
reach
it
from
the
back
because
it's
not
fungible
and
you
don't
get
an
answer
anybody
could
accept.
and
you
can't
reach
it
from
the
front
because,
whether
or
not
it's
a
nullity,
the
statute
still
means
this
and
even
if
it...
and
we
think
it
isn't
a
nullity
because
it
does
add
something
and
it
says
it
in
a
different
way.
i
guess
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is...
and
try
to
reserve
some
little
time,
if
there
is
any
left...
that...
and
the
statute
i've
given
you,
1710...
or
1712...
it
used
to
provide
that
there
had
to
be
a
separate
ballot
in
guam
and
in
the
virgin
islands
for
an
election
for
delegate.
then
in
1998,
it
was
changed
to
say
that
you
didn't
have
to
have
a
separate
ballot
in
guam,
but
not
the
virgin
islands.
the
virgin
islands
still
has
to
have
two
ballots.
now,
if
you
follow
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
literally,
that
would
be
creating
a
whole
new
realm
for
litigation,
and
you'll
get
one
for
certain
from
the
virgin
islands
next
time
because
now
you
have...
assume
the
numbers
which
are
wrong,
but
assume
you're
dealing
again
about...
with
about
45,000
voters.
you're
going
to
have
45,000
ballots
for
the
delegate,
and
you're
going
to
have
45,000
ballots
for
the
other
races.
so,
you're
going
to
have
90,000
ballots
returned.
now,
you
have
90,000
ballots
returned.
the
majority
is
45,000,
and
that's
all
the
voters
you've
got.
nobody
will
ever
win
an
election
in
the
virgin
islands
if
that's
the
rule
that
is
applied.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
reply,
as
long
as
my
time
holds
out,
to
four
or
five
specific
points
that
were
made.
first
of
all,
in
the
discussion
about
the
eligible
voters,
i
think
the
colloquy
and
justice
scalia's
comments
cleared
that
up.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
it's
important
to
go
back
and...
and
deal
with
really
the...
the
grandfather
case
that
deals
with
this
basic
problem,
and
that's
county
of
cass
against
johnston.
this
court
which
laid
down
a
rule
which
has
been
uniformly
followed
and
that
is
for
qualified
voters
who
absent
themselves
from
an
election
duly
called,
they
are
presumed
to
have
gone
along
with
the
majority
who
did,
in
fact,
vote.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no.
you're
correct.
they
were
dealing...
excuse
me...
with
missouri
law
under
those
circumstances.
but
they
laid
down
that
law
and
they
didn't
do
it
with
the
limitation.
but
the
second
sentence
i
think
is
very
important.
this
is
cass.
and
it
not
only
stated
that
general
rule,
but
then
it
stated
this.
any
other
rule
would
be
productive
of
the
greatest
inconvenience
and
ought
not
to
be
adopted
unless
the
legislative
will
to
that
effect
is
clearly
expressed.
in
other
words,
a
very
strong
presumption
that
the
rule
contended
for
by
the
respondents
should
not
be
adopted
unless
it's
clearly
expressed.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no.
you're
quite
right,
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
but
there
was
no
limitation
with
respect
to
laying
down
the
rule,
and
it
has
been
cited
many,
many
times
in
many
other
cases.
but
nonetheless,
it
makes
it
quite
clear
that
you
won't
go
along
with
the
respondents'
position
unless
it
is
clearly
expressed.
and
i
thought
it
was
most
interesting
just
a
moment
ago
when
counsel
said
that
he
would
concede...
and
as
i
heard
him
say
directly...
that
it
doesn't
make
it...
if
could
read
my
handwriting--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--doesn't
make
it
absolutely...
absolutely
was
the
word.
thank
you.
now,
if
it
doesn't
make
it
absolutely
clear,
it
doesn't
comply
with
cass.
now,
you
may
decide
not
to
follow--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--i
could
not
argue,
justice
stevens,
if
the
statute
said
you
take
all
of
the
votes
that
were
cast
in
the
general
election
and
determine
the
majority,
of
course,
we're
bound
by
that.
but
that...
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
even
infers
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
using
the
general
election...
it's
taken
right
out
of
the
blue
by
the
imagination
of
the
ninth
circuit.
there's
nothing
in
there
that
says
you're
going
to
lose...
use
all
those
votes.
in
any
election
does
not
say
we're
going
to
use
all
those
votes
that
were
cast
in
all
of
the
elections
at
the
general
election
on
that
date.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
you
don't
have
an
answer.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--precisely.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no,
you're
quite
right.
it
says
nothing
about
it.
but
the
phrase
is
still
there.
in
any
election,
they
must
have
a
majority.
now,
how...
how
can
you
rule
out
the
runoff
when
it
says
in
any
election
you
must
have
a
majority?
and
so
you
could
go
on
and
do
this
forever.
furthermore,
there's
a
real
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you
could
even
have
a
second
runoff.
this
provides
that
there...
if
there
isn't
a
majority,
there
shall
be
an
election
14
days
later.
you
can't
have
a
second
election
14
days
later.
the
code
does
not
provide
for
a
second
runoff.
and
i
would
recommend
to
the
court
to
take
a
quick
look
at
the
amicus
brief
which
makes
a
primary
point
that
if
you
adopt
a
rule
such
as
this,
you're
going
to
have
a
situation
where
you
may
never
have
a
governor
elected
in
an
election
where
it's
close.
and
certainly
the
blank
ballots
would...
would
rule
that
out.
in
connection
with
the
cass
doctrine,
i
would
also
mention
one
other
matter,
which
is
a
federal
case
dealing
with
the
railroad
labor
act,
the
virginia
railroad
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
and
there
the
act
provides
that
you
have
to
have
a
majority
of
the
people
in
a
particular
trade
in
order
to
form
a
union.
and
the
court
there
says
specifically
it
means,
just
as
cass
did,
only
those
voting
and
you've
got
to
presume
those
who
didn't
vote
go
along
with
it.
but
it
explains
the
reason,
and
it
explains
the
reason
much
as
cass
did.
and
the
reason
is
that
a
few
disaffected
people,
a
small
minority,
by
not
voting
or
voting
some
other
peculiar
way,
could
prevent
the
adoption
of
a
very
important
principle
one
way
or
another--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well,
that's
right.
i
don't
know
of
anybody
who
says
that,
that
you've
got
to...
once
you
get
a
close
election,
you've
got
to
have
another
election.
because
we
have
a
lot
of
elections,
some
even
in
small
jurisdictions,
where
they're
won
by
one
vote,
and
they're
won
when
they're
won
by
one
vote
after
about
three
recounts,
or
however
it
comes
out.
with
regard
to
the
delegate
statute
having
different
language,
we've
talked
about
that
at
some
length,
and
as
i
say,
i
think
we
get
some
help
out
of
it.
they
think
it's
good
for
them.
but
the
important
point
that
hasn't
been
developed
that's
in
the
briefs
is
that
the
delegate
statute
is
different
from
the
organic
act,
but
it
was
passed
4
years
subsequently.
now,
this
argument
seems
to
be
that
you
adopt
an
organic
act
at
one
time
and
you
don't
say
we're
going
to
specifically
count
the
majority
in
the
gubernatorial
election,
although
we
now
concede
it
says
that
twice.
that's
the
problem.
then
we
come
back
to
4
years
later
congress
adopts
the
act
with
respect
to
the
delegate
statute
and
says
it
has
to
be
with
regard
to
the...
the
votes
for
the
delegate's
office.
now,
can
you
say
when
a
congress
does
something
in
different
language
4
years
later,
it
has
done
something
to
the
original
act?
the
one
answer
might
be
that
the
congress
4
years
later
had
a
better
english
teacher
than
the
ones
4
years
before.
but
however
that
comes
about,
you
can't
modify
the
statute
4
years
before
just
because
somebody
used
different
language
in
a
statute
4
years
later.
with
regard
to
the
argument
that
in
a
runoff
election
the
one
who
has
simply
the...
got
the
most
votes
is
going
to
win
is
not
established
at
all.
if
you
look
at
page
26
of
the
respondents'
brief,
they
cite
two
cases.
they're
of
no
help
whatsoever.
one
of
them
is
a
texas
case,
one
is
a
georgia
case.
but
in
one
of
those
cases--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--certainly,
your
honor.
