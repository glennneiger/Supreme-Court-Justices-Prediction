justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
that
they
were...
sorry.
finish
it.
i...
i
didn't
mean
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
it
mean...
probably
not,
but
i'm
just...
but
the...
imagine
on
a
particular
day
we
get
our
ballot
and
there
are
14
different
offices.
and
they're
thinking
that
any
election...
they're
calling
governor
one
election;
lieutenant
governor,
another
election;
secretary
of
state,
a
third
election,
whatever.
and
so,
there
are
14
different
elections
being
hold
on
that
one
day,
and
they're
thinking
in
any
election
means
you
look
at
all
the
ones.
you
see,
you
look
at
all
14,
and
that's
why
they
look
to
the
whole
ballot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
so,
in
any...
so,
it
has
to
be
a
majority
of
them
cast
in
any
election.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
we
look
and
see
how
many
people
filled
out
ballots
because
that's
the
number
cast
in
any
election.
there
were
14
on
that
day,
and
the
total
number...
i
don't
want
to
be
too
clever
about
it,
but
i
want
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--doesn't...
doesn't
your
view,
which
makes
sense
of
every
word,
make
still
the
words,
in
any
election,
surplus?
because...
because
if
you...
if
you
didn't
have
those
words
there
in
your
view
of
the
statute,
the
statute
would
obviously
apply
to
the
1970
election,
the
1974,
the
19...
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
anyone
doubt
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
without
those
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
doesn't
it
obviously
mean...
i
mean,
doesn't
it
cut
against
you,
that
sentence?
because
as
you
read
it,
it
says
the
governor
shall
be
elected
by
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast
by
the
people
who
are
qualified
to
vote
for
legislature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
mean...
they
couldn't
mean...
votes
cast
by
all
the
people
on
the
island
who
are
qualified.
so,
therefore,
they
must
mean
votes
cast
for
governor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
isn't
it
somewhere
between
obviously
meaning
votes
cast
for
governor
or
meaning
just
what
justice
scalia
said,
repeating
the
ambiguity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you
agree
that
it
makes
much
more...
or
there
are
certainly
different
and...
and
perhaps
better
reasons
for
applying
that
kind
of
rule
in
the
case
of
a
proposition
or
a
bond
issue,
that
sort
of
thing,
different
and
better
reasons
from
the
reasons
that
would
apply
in...
in
an
election
of
an
official?
we
don't
have
to
have
the
bond
issue.
we
do
have
to
have
a
governor.
why
make
it
tough
as...
as
tough
to
elect
a
governor
as
it
would
be
to...
to
issue
bonds?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely,
but
if
we're...
if
we're
unclear
about
that,
the
philosophy
of
bond
issues
is
different
from
the
philosophy
of
elections.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there...
is
there...
suppose
you
came
to
the
conclusion
hypothetically
that
the
statutory
language
and
so
forth
brilliantly
argued
both
sides.
it's
hard
to
say,
you
know.
but
then
think
well,
if
you
interpreted
the...
the
blue
brief
way,
you
get
conformity
with
the
delegate.
you
get
the
same
group
recalling
as
would
be
electing.
it's
a
little
bit
simpler.
and
the
guam
election
commission
is
closer
to
it
than
we
are.
now...
now,
i'm...
see,
i
put
four
things
in
there,
and
i...
i
wanted
to
see
what
your
response
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we...
do
they
get
a
little
bit
or
not
of
deference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
happens
in
your
opinion,
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
point?
suppose
a
runoff
and
in
the
runoff
a
has
5,001,
b
has
5,000,
and
there
are
3
blank
ballots.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
because...
not
because
of
that.
but...
but...
maybe
because
of
that.
but
even
if
that
sentence
weren't
there,
it
just
says
you
have
to
have
a
runoff,
but
it
doesn't
say
what
happens...
it
says
nothing
about
what
votes
you
count
in
the
runoff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
his
countervailing
policy
argument,
which
is
where
it's
that
close,
think
about
it
twice?
