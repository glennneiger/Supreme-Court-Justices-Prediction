justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hufstedler,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
would
you
clarify
for
us
the
status
of
some
case
pending
now
before
the
guam
supreme
court
that
affects
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what...
what
are
the
issues
before
the
court
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hufstedler,
i
guess
the
ninth
circuit
was
persuaded
by
what
it
read
into
the
words,
in
any
election--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
phrase
in
section
1422.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
that
phrase
were
entirely
omitted
from
the
statute,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view?
i
mean,
or
would
the
results
still
be
the
same?
