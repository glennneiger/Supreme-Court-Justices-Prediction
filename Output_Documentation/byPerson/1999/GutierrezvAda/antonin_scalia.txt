justice
antonin
scalia
the
terms
is
votes
cast.
i
guess
that...
that
would
be
the
critical
term,
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
if
you
vote
for
nobody,
as
opposed
to
voting
for
donald
duck,
you
have
cast
a
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
they...
they
did
go
on
to
say
by
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
delegate.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
is
one
of
the
points
against
your
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
in
this
statute
where
they
intend
to
limit
the
vote
cast
to
those
cast
for
that
office,
they
say
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
implication
is
that
where
they
don't
say
that,
they...
they
don't
mean
to
limit
it
to...
to
the
votes
cast
for
that
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
does...
does
seem
to
indicate--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
just
repeats
the
same
question
you
have
in
the
next
sentence,
that
is
to
say,
when...
when
it
says
votes
cast,
does
it
mean
votes
cast
for
this
office,
or
does
it
mean
votes
cast
in
the
election
generally?
i
mean,
it's
the
same
problem
that
arises
in
the
next
sentence.
i...
i
don't
think
you
advanced
the
ball
much
by...
by
saying
that
the
same
problem
comes
up
twice.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
key...
the
key
word
there
is
generally.
the...
the
problem
i...
i
have
with...
with
your
case,
mr.
riordan,
is
that
ordinarily
where
you
have
a
choice,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
interpret
a
runoff
provision
in
such
a
manner
that
it
will
produce
a
conclusive
runoff
and
not
just
a
repeat
of...
of
another
stalemate
in
which
nobody
gets
a
majority.
and
as
you
read
this,
this
process
could
go
on
endlessly
in
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
which
nobody
gets
a
majority
of...
of
all
the
votes
cast.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have
to
be
a
special
election?
don't
you
think
the...
that...
that
guam,
if
possible,
would
schedule
it...
you
know,
with
some
other
elections
that
are...
that
are
coming
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that
the
runoff
has
to
be
a
special
election?
i
mean,
that...
that
the
ballot...
the
ballot
can
include
nothing
but...
but
the...
the
candidates
for
governor.
justice
antonin
scalia
does...
does
any
of
those
american
cases
that
you
cite
involve
an
election
for
an
office
as
opposed
to
a
proposition
or...
see,
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to...
to
interpret
such
a
provision
that
is
dealing
with
an
initiative
or
some
proposition
to
say
it...
it
has
to
get
a
certain
percentage
of
all
of
those
voting
in
the
election,
whether
they
vote
for
the
proposition
or
not,
because
you
have
to
show
that
it
has
sufficient
public
support.
but
i...
you
know,
i...
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
normal
interpretation
of
the
same
language
when
you're
talking
about
two
candidates.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
and...
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
that
statute
read,
you
know,
it
has
to
get
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
at
the
election,
i
would
have
thought
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
votes
cast
with
respect
to
the
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
it
if...
if
the
consequence
would
be
we're
going
to
bring
in
two
other
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
see
if
these...
these
other
two
can
attract.
but
all
that
happens
is
you
bring
in
the
same...
the
same
two
guys
2
weeks
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
i...
i
should
know
this
point,
but
i'm...
but
i'm
not
clear
on
it.
is
it
your
position
that
even
spoiled
ballots
have
to
be
counted
for
purposes
of
this
proposition,
that
is,
one...
one
that
votes
for
both
parties
or
one
that
votes
for
neither
or
checks
write
in
but
never
writes
in?
are
they
to
be
counted
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
academic
for
this
case,
but
it's
not
academic
for
the
purpose
for
which
i
was
asking
the
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
whether
the
runoff--
justice
antonin
scalia
--will
necessarily
come
up
with
a
winner.
and
it
won't
if
you're
counting
all
of
the
ballots
cast
because
if
you
have...
you
know,
you
say
it
only
takes
2
or
3
percent
difference
sometimes.
if
you
have
2
or
3
percent
of
spoiled
ballots,
you
may
have
to
have
a
second
runoff.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other...
any
other
state
or
federal
or,
for
that
matter,
foreign
statute
in
which
the
chief
executive
must
be
elected
by
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
in...
in
an
election,
including
votes
cast
for
other
offices?
it's
a
very
strange
provision
if
that's
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
that
congress
knew
it
was
a
delicate
issue?
in
my
experience
congress
doesn't
have
a
very
detailed
knowledge
of
what's
going
in
the
courts,
and
probably
a
good
thing
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can
agree
with
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said
it
wasn't
absolutely
clear,
but
this
is
by
far
the
better
reading.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
any
election.
because
of
the
sentence
that
says
in
any
election.
that
would
presumably
include
the
runoff
election.
