bordello...
bordallo...
pardon
me...
v.
ada/camacho.
spectators
are
admonished.
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
we've
still
got
a

mr.

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
where
can
we
find
the
statute
in
the
materials
before
us,
mr.
hufstedler?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would...
your
case
is
stronger,
is
it
not,
by
virtue
of
the
use
of
the
word
votes
rather
than
ballots?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hufstedler.
mr.
riordan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
blue
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can't
that
be
read
as
just
saying
that
if
you're
entitled...
something
like
the
federal
constitution...
says
if
you're
entitled
to
vote
for
the
members
of
the
lower...
of
the
legislature
of
guam,
you're
entitled
to
vote
for
governor?
i...
i
think
you
don't
have
to
put
all
the
weight
on
it
that...
that
you're
putting.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
do
we
find
that,
mr.
riordan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
could
tie.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
riordan.
mr.
hufstedler,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
involved
no
federal
statute
at
all,
did
it?
i
suppose
the
way
it
can
become
relevant
is
if
you...
if
you
assume...
perhaps
not
a
terribly
likely
assumption...
that
congress
was
familiar
with
it,
though,
when--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
case
was
a
diversity
case,
was
it
not?
i
mean,
it
wasn't
laying
down
any
federal
rule
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
hufstedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-51
gutierrez
against
ada
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
