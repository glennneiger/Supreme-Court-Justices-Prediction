but,
mr.
hufstedler,
even
if
we
agreed
that
in
any
election
means
in
any
gubernatorial
election,
why
shouldn't
the
people
who
didn't
vote
for
governor
be
counted
the
same
way
as
someone
who
voted
for
donald
duck
for
governor?
in
other
words,
why
shouldn't
they
be
counted
as
people
who
said
neither
of
the
above,
no
one
for
governor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
may
i
ask
if
that
is
academic
in
this
case?
because
isn't
it
true
that
even
if
you
counted
all
the
overvotes,
votes
for
both,
and
even
if
you
cast
all
the
write
ins
as
though
they
were
cast
for
your
client,
that
the
opposing
candidate
would
still
win?
so,
it's
only
the
undervotes
that
have...
that
are
the
basis
for
your
argument,
that
you
would
have
to
throw
in
the
undervotes
in
order
to
make
the...
the
winner
83
votes
short.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those...
those
ballots
voted
in
the
election
for
governor.
they
may
have
been--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--whether
1,313
didn't
vote
in
that
election.
and...
and
on
the
question
of
what
election
means,
in
any
election
is
the
first
time
election
appears
in...
in
the
sentence
if
no
candidate,
but
the
next
time
it
is
referring
to
a
runoff
election,
which
is
an
election
between
the
two
sets
of
candidates.
so,
why
would
the
word
election
meaning...
mean
two
different
things
in
the
same
sentence?
that
is,
in
the
second
usage
of
it,
it
clearly
means
just
the
runoff
between
the
two
sides.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
tied
to
the
original
separate
ballot
requirement,
that
you
didn't
vote
for
the
delegate
in
the
general
election?
so,
of
course,
it
would
be
only
an
election
for
the
delegate,
and
it
wasn't
until
the
change
was
made
to
allow
the
delegate
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
of
a
general
election
that...
that
this...
that
you
could
make
this
argument.
that
is,
the
original
purpose...
it
seems
to
be
tied
to
the
separate
ballot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they're
both
plausible
readings,
why
shouldn't
we
pick
the
one
that
makes
the
most
sense?
