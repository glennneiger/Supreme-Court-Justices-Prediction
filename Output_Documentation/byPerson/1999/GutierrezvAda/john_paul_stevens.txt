yes,
but
that
doesn't
explain
this
question
that
arises
in
my
mind.
why
would
they
want
the
people
who
voted
for
governor
to
be
the
universe
in
the
recall
situation
and
not
be
the
universe
in
the
direct
election
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
policy
reason
behind
it,
that
congressional
choice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it
would
if...
if
a
third
of
the...
if
instead
of
just
a
couple
thousand
in
this
election
had
a...
you
had
a
third
of
the
total
votes
cast
for
blank
and
the
governor,
then
you
could
recall
with
the
lesser
number
than
you
could
elect
in
the
first
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just
gave
you
a
hypo
with
that...
that
example
in
it.
say
there
are
100,000
who
vote,
and
40,000
don't
vote
for
governor.
they're
just
interested
in
the
school
board.
so,
60,000
elected
the
governor...
or
voted
for
the
governor.
two
thirds
of
that
60,000
could...
could
recall
him
even
though
it
only
took...
40,000
could
recall
him
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
have
taken
51,000
to
elect
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
runoffs
for
other
offices?
can
you
have
a
runoff
for
another
office
like
the
school
board
under
this
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
you
could,
presumably
they
could
have
it
at
the
same
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
really
kind
of
ironic
that
they
have
a
majority
requirement
when
there
are
lots
of
candidates,
and
when
there
are
only
two,
they
don't
call
it
a
majority,
even
though
it
has
to
be
a
majority,
as...
as
justice
kennedy
points
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
obviously--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
also
used
the
word
highest
when
they
meant
higher
because
there
are
only
two
candidates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
question
which
kind
of
underlies
my
thinking
about
this
case?
is
there
any
sensible
reason
why
congress
would
want
one
rule
for
the
virgin
islands
and
a
different
rule
for
guam?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
his...
what
if
the
language
really
is
by
far
the
better
reading,
his...
his
way?
what
if...
you
know,
yours...
yours
is...
his
isn't
absolutely
positive,
but
it's...
it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--certainly
the
language
tilts
in
his--
