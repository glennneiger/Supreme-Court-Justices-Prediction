justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you...
if
we
add
up
all
the
residences
that
burn
up
each
year,
that
has
a
pretty
big
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
if
we
add
up
all
of
them?
i
mean,
isn't
it
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of...
of
wood
and
bricks
and
whatever
burns
up
and...
and
you
have
to
have
fire
departments
from
all
over
the
place.
and
i
mean,
you
know,
whole
cities
can
burn
down,
but
i
don't
know
that
they
do.
but
nonetheless,
there
is
a
lot...
many,
many
residences
in
fires
that...
you're
saying
you
add
up
all
that
across
the
board
and
that
isn't
substantial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
thinking
of...
i'm
not
thinking
of...
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
it's
substantial
or
not
substantial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even...
even
though
you
burn
up
all
the
wood
that
moved
in
interstate
commerce?
you
burned
up
all
the...
the
carpets
that
came
from
persia.
you
burn
up
all
the
whatever.
and
that's
still
not...
all
that
taken
together
is
not
substantial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't...
i
didn't...
all
right.
now,
my...
now,
my...
is
it...
what
i'm
trying
to
drive
at
is
it...
are
you
claiming
that
it
just
in
quantitative
amount
is
not
substantial
or
that
we
shouldn't
aggregate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
really
trying
to
get
whether
you
think
we
should...
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
trying
to
drive
at
something,
and
my
question
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
and
that's
what
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
understand
it.
that's
what
leads
to
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at
is
why
should
you
not
be
able
to
aggregate
with
residences,
but
can
you
then
aggregate
in
respect
to
businesses?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
your...
in
your
view
if
you
win
this
case,
it
is
also
true
that,
since
you
could
not
aggregate,
business
arsons
are
also
out
unless
you
prove
a
substantial
effect
between
this
individual
grocery
store
and
interstate
commerce
or
this
individual
swimming
pool
distributor.
that's
your
view.
and
the
same,
i
guess,
is
true
of
apartment
houses
that
are
rented
unless
you
prove
that
this
apartment
was
rented
to
a...
a
person
from...
you
see
my
point.
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
that's
what
i'm
interested--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
that
view...
by
the
way,
how
do
you...
i've
got
your
answer,
which
i
appreciate.
and...
and
on
that
view,
too,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
court's
earlier
case
about
a
house
that
happened
to
be
on
the
market
for
being
rented
with
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
any
person
who
even
looked
at
the
house
was
from
out
of
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
duplex,
all
right.
same...
same--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
see
anything
in
the
opinion
that
said
anyone
who
rented
the
house
was
from
out
of
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
that
anyone
who
looked
at
the
house
was
from
out
of
state.
so,
i
just
wonder
how
you
reconcile
that
with
what
you've
told
me
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
particular
building.
we
cannot
aggregate
and
that's
true
whether
it's
a
business,
whether
it's
a
rental
house,
duplex,
whether
it's
owned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
it
might.
i
mean,
isn't
there
a
long
line
of
antitrust
cases
where
the
words,
affecting
commerce,
are
over
and
over
said
that
that's
an
indication
that
congress
wants
to
exert
its
full
commerce
power?
i
mean,
i
thought
there
are
lots
of
cases
that
say
that.
i
might
be
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
fairly
well-known.
it
might
be
that
senators
and
congressmen
do
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
before...
i'm
perhaps
asking
you
to
repeat
something
you've
said,
but
i
don't
have
it
precisely.
justice
scalia
earlier
asked...
and
he
certainly
had
a
point,
and
justice
o'connor
picked
it
up.
and
when
i
look
back
at
the
statute,
i
realize
this
covers
arson
of
any
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
really
everything.
so...
so,
given
that,
what
do
those
words
precisely
used
in,
on
your
theory
of
pushing
to
the
limit...
because
he's
right
in
saying
that
it's
the
word
affecting
commerce
that
has
the
tradition.
it's
not
the
word
used
in.
and...
and
what
do
they
mean
on
your
theory?
can
you
give
them
any
meaning
at
all?
i
can't
think
of
any.
and...
and
you
said
there
is,
but
i
haven't
got
precisely
what
it
is.
