justice
antonin
scalia
--have
to
admit
it's
a
very
peculiar
statute
if
it...
it
reaches
someone
who
sets
fire
to
a
private
residence
that
is
owned
by
the
occupant...
i'm
sorry.
it
does
not,
as
you
would
say,
apply
in
that
case,
but
it
does
apply
if...
if
you
set
fire
to
a...
a
building
that
is
rented
by
the
occupant.
that's
just
a
very
strange...
strange
distinction.
i
don't
know
why
congress
would
draw
that
kind
of
a
line.
and
we're
talking
here
about
the
statutory
construction,
never
mind
the
constitutional
limitation.
doesn't
that
strike
you
as
rather
peculiar?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
imagine
the
two
criminals
saying,
gee,
is
this...
is
this
building
leased
or...
or
is
it
owned
by
the
occupant?
if
it's,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it's
owned
by
the
occupant,
we
don't
have
to
worry.
it's
not
a
federal
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
they
could
probably
kill
clergymen
without
its
being
a
federal
offense,
couldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
shock
me,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
a
federal
offense
to
kill
a
clergyman,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
these
devices
excluded
from...
from
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
if
they
have
been
not
licensed,
if
they've
been
made
by
somebody
who's
not
licensed?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
you've
just
said
makes
sense
if,
in
fact,
congress
has
said
we
don't
want
any
destructive
devices
traveling
in
interstate
commerce,
and
as
a
means
of
enforcing
that
prohibition,
which
congress
undoubtedly
has
the...
has
the
power
to
enact,
we're
going
to
punish
anyone
who
makes
one
without
having
been
properly
licensed
to
make
one.
but
you
have
to
start
with
step
one.
has
it
been
excluded
from
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
saying
their
transport
is
regulated.
in...
in
what
respect?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
falk,
if...
if
you
want
to,
you
know,
argue
this
on...
on
the
textual
basis,
i
don't...
don't
you
think
it's
hard
to
draw
a
line
between
a
use
for
mortgaging,
a
use
for
leasing,
and...
and
so
forth?
i
can
understand
it
if
you
thought
when...
when
the
statute
says
used
in
an
activity
that
substantially
affects
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
it
means
used
in
the
way
that
property
is
normally
used,
in
considering
the
primary
purpose
for
the
property,
namely
to
provide
shelter,
to
provide
heat,
light
for...
for
any
activity.
then
it
would
make
some
sense
if...
if
it's
being
used
as
a
building
for
some
purpose
affecting
interstate
commerce.
but
you're
apparently
willing
to
say
that
it's
enough
if
it's
used,
you
know,
for
a
mortgage,
which
is
certainly
not
the...
the
normal
use
of
a
building.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
you're
willing
to
accept
used
as
a
lease...
used...
used
for...
for
rental.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
willing
to
accept
it
or
do
you
have
to
accept
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i...
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
draw
a
line
between
using
it
for...
as
rental
property
and
using
it
in
order
to
get
money
through
a
mortgage.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
one
is...
is
the
primary,
principal,
ultimate
use
of
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose...
suppose
we...
we
can't
find
any...
any
reasonable
distinction
between
burning
leased
property
and
burning
property
resided
in
by
the
owner.
and
therefore,
we
proceed
to
the
constitutional
question,
and
we
find
it's
unconstitutional
to...
to
provide
for
a
federal
offense
in
either
event.
are
we
still
stuck
with
interpreting
this
statute
the
way
russell
did?
do
we
have
to
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
or
could
we
say,
in
light
of
the
constitutional
problem,
the
statute
should
be
read
more
narrowly?
russell
didn't...
didn't
consider
any
constitutional
problem,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
us
a
hypothetical
where...
where
that
wouldn't
exist?
i
mean,
he
mentioned
shoplifting.
i
assume
you
think
the
federal
government
can
make
all
shoplifting
a
federal
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
what
about...
what
about
theft
from
a
private
home?
if
you
say
that
burning
a
private
home
affects
interstate
commerce,
why
wouldn't,
you
know,
theft
from
a
private
homeowner
affect
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
theft
from
a
home
you're
willing
to
concede
could
not
be
made
a
federal
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
give
me
something
you
are
willing
to
concede.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
something,
one...
one
little
thing.
i
mean,
you're
coming
up
with
a
principle
that
you
say,
you
know,
i
mean,
the
constitution
meant
something
when
it...
when
it
limited
the
federal
government
to
matters
involving
interstate
commerce.
and
we
know
that
they
did
not
intend
the
federal
government
to
have
general
criminal
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
is
it
that's
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
us
an
example
of
one
that
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
we
haven't
decided
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they're
going
to
put
in
a
jurisdictional
element.
you
know,
anyone
who...
who
steals
from
a
house
that...
property
that
has...
that
has
been
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
do
you
think
that
would
suffice?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
used
to...
it
was
used
to
cover
the
ground
too,
but
when
you
say
what
is
the
house
used
for,
that
is...
that
is
not
the
normal
meaning
that
one
associates
with
what
is
it...
what
is
the
house
used
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
one
would
think,
well,
it
was
used
to
get
a
mortgage.
that's
not
what
houses
are
used--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
used
as
a
residence?
is
it
used
as
a
barber
shop?
is
it
used...
you
know.
that...
that's
what
we're
talking
about
normally.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
use
his
house.
it
wasn't
his
house.
i
mean,
the
mortgage
company
didn't
use
the
house.
it
wasn't
the
mortgage
company's
house
to
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
relied
on
it?
you...
you
really
think
that...
that
a
majority
of
the
house
and
the
senate
and
the
president
as
well
who
signed
the
bill,
knew
about
this
case,
reliance
fuel?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
had
this
case
in
mind
when
they
voted
for
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
probably
means
the
committee
staff
knew
about
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
it
means
that
anybody
else
knew
about
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
we
have
cases
that
say
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
said
any...
any
arson
affecting
commerce.
it
didn't
say
any
arson
affecting
commerce.
that
would
have
been
the
broadest
possible
use
of
the
affecting
commerce
language.
it
said
arson
of
a
building
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
because
they
thought
this...
this
other
language
was
an
adequate
substitute
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that
helps
your
case
or
hurts
your
case.
i
don't
know
which.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
covers
the
burning
of
a
church?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
a
church
that
isn't
mortgaged.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then...
but
you're
frustrating
this
legislative
history
you've
just
talked
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
seem
to
think
that
it...
it
should
have
covered
all
churches.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
you
think
congress
can
do
that
in
a
criminal
statute,
not...
not
say,
look
it,
this
is
what
we're
criminalizing,
but
rather
say,
we're
criminalizing
as
much
as
we
can
criminalize
because,
boy,
this
is
so
hard
to
figure
out,
we're
not
going
to
try
to
draw
the
line,
we're
going
to
let
the
courts
figure
it
out?
now,
congress
is
unable
to
draw
the
line
itself
with
its
massive
staff,
and...
and
the
individual
citizen
who's
supposed
to
know
whether
he's
violating
a
federal
law
or
not
has
to
what?
he's
going
to
have
to
figure
out
what
the
courts
are
going
to
say
is...
is
far
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
question
whether
congress
can
do
that
and
just
say
we're
going
to
extend
this
criminal
statute
as
far
as
the
courts
will
let
us
extend
it.
do
you
think...
don't
you
think
that's
vague?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know
what
the
crime
was.
you
knew
that...
that
it
was
a
crime
to
assault
a
police
officer.
when
you
assault
somebody,
you're
taking
a
chance
that
it's
an
undercover
police
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that...
that
drawing
down
an
infinitesimal
overall
amount
of
natural
gas
causes
the
building,
within
the
meaning
that
congress
had
in
mind,
to
be
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
each
one
has
to
stand
on
its
own.
i
don't...
i...
i
don't
think
if
neither...
neither
one
suffices,
the
three
together
suffice.
justice
antonin
scalia
--uses
mail.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
your
gas
theory
is
right,
the
statute
was
written
wrong.
it
should
have
read
whoever
maliciously
damages,
destroys,
blah,
blah,
by
means
of
fire
and
explosive,
any
vehicle
or
any
building
or
other
real
or
personal
property
used
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
because,
as
you
acknowledge,
every
vehicle
on
your
theory
would
be
covered.
and
it's
really
redundant,
attaching
to
the
word
vehicle,
used
in...
you
know,
in
any
activity
affecting
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
concerned
about
the
states.
i'm
concerned
about
the
citizens.
i
think
that's
what
justice
kennedy
was
concerned
about
too.
if
there's
some
agreement
among
state
law
enforcement
officers
and
the
federal
government,
the
federal
government
can
do
whatever
it
wants,
that
doesn't
make
it
any
the
less
obnoxious
with
regard
to
the
citizens
of
that
state.
