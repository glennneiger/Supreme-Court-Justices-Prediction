justice
david
h.
souter
so,
with
respect
to
the
mortgage,
are
you
conceding
that
it
is
used
but
simply
saying
that
use
is
irrelevant
because
it's
not
used
in
an
activity?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in...
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
do
you
concede
that
it
is
used
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
that
the
use
is
not
a
use
in
an
activity
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
i
thought
that
was
the
argument
that
you
were
making,
but
i
want
to
get
clear
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the...
doesn't
your
argument,
in
effect,
entail
the
conclusion
that
the
jurisdictional
element
will
always
be
satisfied?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
argument,
if...
if
the
jurisdictional
element
is
sufficient
to
get
the
privately
owned
house,
then
the
jurisdictional
element
does
not
act
as
a
limitation.
and...
and
i
don't,
therefore,
know
why
it
would
be
in
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may...
i
mean,
in
the...
in
the
brute
sense,
it
uses
the
house
when
the
moment
for
foreclosure
comes
and
it
wants
to
realize
its
money.
but
may
i
get
back
to
my...
my
original
point?
and
that
is,
what
is
being
excluded
under
this
statute
in
the
arson
case?
and
it
sounds
to
me,
from
what
you've
said,
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
your
argument
to
say
that
the
statute
would
not
cover
arson
of
a
house,
which
was
built
by
the
owner
without
the
use
of
borrowed
money
and
was
not
insured
and
was
heated
with
wood
cut
on
the
property--
[laughter]
--but
it
wouldn't
exclude
much
more
than
that,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
wise
concession,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
really,
would
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
it
exclude
much
more?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
problem
i
have,
though,
is
if
the
only
thing
that
is
excluded
is
something
as
trivial
as
the
example
that
i
came
up
with,
it
just
does
not
seem
plausible
to
me
that
congress
would
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
putting
in
this
jurisdictional
prerequisite
simply
to
exclude
something
as...
almost
as
silly
at
that.
and,
therefore,
i...
i
feel
bound
to
try
to
give
it
as
a
matter
of...
of
statutory
construction,
looking
to
congressional
intent,
a
broader
meaning.
am
i...
am
i
wrong
in...
in
feeling
that
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
justice
david
h.
souter
--fall
back
to
bicycles.
