day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
house
is
used...
the
property
is
put
up
to
get
a
mortgage
to
get
money
to
go
into
an
interstate
trucking
business?
he
needs
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
homeowner
does.
so,
has
he
used
the
house
in...
in
the
sense
contemplated
by
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
falk--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you'd
say
the
church
got
heat
from
natural
gas.
you'd
be
back
into
the
same
kind
of
argument
you're
making
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but,
mr.
dreeben,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
you
read
used
in
an
activity
in
the
statute
to
encompass
these
passive
sorts
of
uses,
the
phrase
is
just
converted
into
something
that
means
anything
affecting
commerce,
and
the
legislative
branch
didn't
use
that
language.
and
it
sort
of
reads
the
phrase
out
of
the
statute
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
really
think
congress
intended
to
cover
private
residences
i
suppose.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
play
the
congressional
intent
game,
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
it
didn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you...
you
have
two
problems
here
really.
you
have
the
notion
that
if
there's
a
constitutional
doubt,
you
try
to
interpret
the
statute
more
narrowly
to
avoid
any
constitutional
problem.
and
you
also,
because
it's
a
criminal
statute,
are
concerned
presumably
with
the
rule
of
lenity.
and
when
you
put
all
those
together,
where
do
you
go?
it
seems
to
me
maybe
a
narrower
reading
of
this
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
your
theory
would
encompass
also
the
notion
that
mail
is
delivered
to
houses,
and
therefore,
mail
comes
interstate
and
every
house--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--uses
mail,
receives
mail.
