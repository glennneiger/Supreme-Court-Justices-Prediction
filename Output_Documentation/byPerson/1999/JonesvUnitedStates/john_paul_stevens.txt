mr.
falk,
are
you
conceding
in
your
argument
that
the
statute
does
apply?
you
seem
to
be
arguing
the
constitutional
issue
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
if...
if
we
did
not
have
the
constitutional
concerns
in
the
background,
do
you
think
the
statutory
language
is
clearly
with
you
or
against
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
if
you're
talking
about
drawing
these
lines.
supposing
this
was
an
18-story
apartment
building
and
every
apartment
is
rented
out,
would
you
agree
the
statute
applies
and
also
there's
congressional
power
to
prevent
that
arson?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
russell
control
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
think...
you
would
think
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to...
to
prohibit
the
arson
of,
say,
skyscrapers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they...
they
have
mortgages.
they
rent
offices
out,
and
they...
and
they
buy
utilities
through
interstate
commerce.
just...
say,
there
are
just
the
three
activities,
but
it's
in
an
18-story
skyscraper
that
you
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
about
churches
then?
they
wouldn't
be
protected,
i
guess.
they
could
burn
down
churches
without
a
federal
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
interpreted
in
russell.
would
you
not
agree
that
if
a
person
owns
property
and
leases
it
out,
buys
and
sells
and
rents
and
so
forth,
in
the
real
estate
market,
that
he's
engaged
in
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
owner
of
the
building
in
russell
was
engaged
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that
the
property
was,
therefore,
being
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce.
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
you
think...
but
why
would
that
be
unconstitutional.
if...
if
congress
can
regulate
the
market
for
buying
and
selling
and
renting
real
estate,
why
is
the
prohibition
of
the
arson
of
a
building
used
in
that
market
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
suggest
that
if
we
looked
at
the
word
vehicle,
we
might
get
some
enlightenment
on
this
issue?
because
you
would...
you
would
argue
a
vehicle
is
used
in
interstate
commerce
if
it
drives
across
the
state
line
and
so
forth.
but
you
wouldn't
argue
that
it's
a
vehicle
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce
because
it
burns
gas,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you
would.
that's
the
analogy
to
the...
to
your
utility--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--okay.
