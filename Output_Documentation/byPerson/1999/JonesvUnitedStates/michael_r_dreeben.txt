mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decision
in
russell
forms
the
background
for
both
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
issues
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
russell
recognized
that
congress
intended
to
go
to
the
limits
of
its
constitutional
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
in
enacting
section
844(i).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that
the...
the
court
addressed
the
construction
of
use
the
way
that
it's
been
discussed
in
this
case.
but
the
court
did
recognize
that
congress
sought
to
exert
its
constitutional
authority
to
protect
real
property
and
personal
property
from
arson
because
of
the
effects
on
the
interstate
economy.
and
congress
guaranteed
that
there
would
be
such
an
effect
in
any
case
in
which
a
prosecution
was
brought
by
providing
a
specific
jurisdictional
element
that
the
government
must
satisfy
in
every
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
do
think
that
the
jurisdictional
element
acts
as
a...
a
limitation,
justice
souter,
although
it
may
not
act
as
a
limitation
that
is
narrower
than
the
constitutional
power
of
congress.
but
it
does
require
that
in
each
case
the
united
states
establish
that
there
is
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
if
the...
that
if
the
federal
government
made
shoplifting
from
businesses
that
do
business
in
interstate
commerce
a
federal
crime,
it
could
do
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
theft
from
a
private
home
is
a
more
difficult
case
than
this
case
because
in
this
case
the
crime
of
arson
is
extremely
likely
to
destroy
the
property
itself,
and
where,
as
here,
the
government
is
able
to
show
that
there
is
an
out-of-state
mortgage
company,
an
out-of-state
insurance
company,
and
out-of-state
supplies
of
natural
gas
that
are
going
to
the
home,
the
destruction
of
the
home
will
create
a
potential--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
wouldn't
be
willing
to
concede.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--my...
my
starting
point
is
the
same
as
the...
the
point
where
the
court
left
off
in
lopez.
the
court
recognized
in
lopez
that
there
is
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
reach
intrastate
activities
that
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
that
it
will
be
a
matter
of
degree
and
a
matter
of
characterization
in
each
case
to
determine
whether
the
particular
statute
does
satisfy
those
requirements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
since
1995,
i'm
happy
with
that
example.
i
do
think--
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
scalia,
a...
a
statute
that
sought
to
regulate
all
crime
without
a
jurisdictional
element
and
without
any
particularized
reason
by
congress--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
would
suffice,
justice
scalia,
because
the
nexus
between
the
interstate
commercial
activity
and
the
crime
is
not
as
close
as
it
is
in
a
case
like
this
one.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
would
probably
lose
that
case
under
lopez
because
the
court
made
clear
that
merely
pointing
to
the...
the
costs
of
crime
is
not
sufficient.
and
that
is
not
what
we
have
done
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
out-of-state
mortgage
company
and
the
house
was
used
in
the
activity
of
the
mortgage
business.
we
have
an
out-of-state
insurance
company
which
had
to
make
a
specific
$75,000
payment
across
state
lines
as
a
result
of
this
arson,
and
we
have
pointed
to
the
presence
of
interstate
utility
connections
which
have
out-of-state
gas
coming
into
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
may
be
payment
from
an
intrastate
insurer
or
an
interstate
insurer,
and
the
court
may
draw
a
distinction
based
on
that.
but
i
do
have
three
different
theories
that
establish
that
there's
an
interstate
connection
to
the
house
in
this
case.
the
mortgage
theory
relies
on
the
fact
that
this
house
was
used
to
procure
the
mortgage
loan
and
that
the
mortgage
company
uses
the
house
as
security
for
that
loan.
it
is
an
out-of-state
business,
and
it
is
a
business
that
suffers
a
direct
foreseeable
effect
if
the
property
that
secures
the
loan
is
destroyed
by
arson.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
think
that
somebody
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
to
back
up
on
the
statutory
construction
question
to
this
court's
decision
in
russell,
russell
establishes
that
uses
of
a
property
are
not
limited
to
those
uses
that
the
occupants
engage
in
in
the
course
of
daily
living.
it
is
also...
it
also
extends
to
uses
that
other
people
make
of
the
property
that
have
some
commercial
nexus.
now,
in
russell
it
was
the
owner
renting
it
out.
in
this
case,
it's
the
mortgage
company
supplying
a
mortgage
and
taking
a
security
interest
in
the
home.
the
homeowner
himself--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
the
mortgage
company
has
a
significant
interest
in
the
house
once
it
grants
the
mortgage
and
it
uses
the
house
as
security
for
that
mortgage.
the
homeowner--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
will
give
away
that
case.
[laughter]
i...
i
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
do--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
i
do
acknowledge
that
under
our
approach
to
the
statute,
its
coverage
is
broad,
and
i
think
that
that
was
consistent
with
congress'
intent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
use
its
commerce
clause
authority
broadly.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
so,
justice
souter,
because
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
congress
selected
the
affecting
commerce
language
that
it
used
in
this
jurisdictional
element
precisely
so
that
it
could
have
a
way
of
indicating
to
this
court
that
it
wished
to
go
to
the
limits
of
its
commerce
clause
authority.
it
relied
on
a
decision
called
reliance
fuel,
which
was
an
nlrb
case,
in
which
this
court
had
said
that
the
affecting
commerce
language
goes
to
the
limit
of
the
commerce
clause
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
i
do
know,
justice
scalia,
is
that
reliance
fuel
was
cited
in
the
committee
report
on
the
bill
to
indicate
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
has
given
the
words,
affecting
commerce
and
in
commerce,
a
term
of
art
sense
that
congress
is
presumed
to
know.
congress
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
and
this
court
operates--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
there
are.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
think
that
it's
a
reasonable
presumption
that
they
do
know,
but
it's
legally
irrelevant
because
this
court
has
said
that
when
congress
does
use
those
words,
it
intends
to
go
to
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause
authority.
and
in
this
case
we
have
some
corroboration
that
the
drafters
of
the
bill
intentionally
did
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
this
court's
cases
are...
are
not
lucid
on
that
issue.
this
case
and
the
russell
case
are
going
to
be
the
primary
cases
giving
a
construction
to
that.
but
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
if
congress
went
to
the
trouble
of
attempting
to
cover
as
much
as
it
possibly
could,
based
on
uses
of
the
property
under
the
arson
statute,
that
it
did
not
intend
that
this
court
give
an
artificially
narrow
meaning
to
the
word
use.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
could
have
also
passed
a
statute
that
had
no
jurisdictional
element
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
but
i
think
that
this
court
ended
up
disagreeing
with
justice
friendly's
analysis
of
the
arson
statute
because
the
property
that
was
at
issue
in
mennuti
was
available
for
rental,
and
judge
friendly
did
not
believe
that
that
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
covering
the...
the
conduct.
and
this
court
disagreed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
concede
that
much.
what...
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is...
is
explain
that
this
court's
decision
construing
the
statute
in
russell
made
it
clear
that
it
goes
to
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause
authority
along--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
did.
but
at
the
time
that
the...
that
the
bill
was
introduced,
it
had
a
specific
for
business
purposes
limitation
in
the
statute.
that
was
deliberately
deleted
by
the
drafters
of
the
bill
before
it
was
enacted,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
what
they...
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
what
the
record
in
the
legislative
history
shows
is
that
there
were...
were
hearings
on
the
bill
that
brought
to
the
attention
of
congressmen
that
there
were
burnings
of
churches
and
police
stations
and
other
buildings
that
were
not
used
for
business
purposes,
and
that
legislators
objected
to
the
restriction
of
a
bill
that
would
deny
the
federal
government
the
ability
to
investigate
and
prosecute
cases
involving
those
kinds--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
we
need
to
show
something
that
will
connect
it
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
think
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
legislative
history
shows
that
because
churches
were
not
covered
under
the
restriction
in
the
bill
that
said
it
covers
property
used
for
business
purposes,
congress
deleted
the
language
that
said
for
business
purposes.
that
is
not
part
of
the
enacted
bill,
and
it
was
done
deliberately
in
order
to
allow
this
bill
to
reach
to
the
limits
of
federal
power.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
could
be,
but
that
is
not
typically
the
sort
of
connection
that
we
have
relied
on
in
prosecuting
cases
like
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
would
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
it
does
read
it
out
of
the
statute,
justice
o'connor.
this
is
not
a
statute
like
section
924(c)
where
this
court
said
use
has
to
mean
active
use
in
some
manner
of
deployment.
in
that
statute,
the
court
was
confronted
with
verbs
that
said
use
or
carry,
and
the
court
had
to
do
something
to
give
those
two
words
independent,
nonduplicative
meaning.
whereas,
this
statute
is
a
statute
where
congress
expressed
its
intention
to
go
to
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause
authority,
and
it
did
not
couple--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
were
some
legislators
who
felt
that
it
couldn't,
and
there
were
other
legislators
who
very
much
wanted
to
provide
federal
authority
to
investigate
and
prosecute
those
sorts
of
crimes.
and
the
compromise
solution
is
a
bill
that
places
it
in
the
hands
of
the
courts
to
determine
whether
the
government
has
proved
the
kinds
of
jurisdictional
connections
that
satisfy
the
constitution.
if
we
can
prove
the
kinds
of
jurisdictional
connections...
and
we
must
do
that...
to
satisfy
the
constitution,
we
have
also
come
within
the
language
of
the
bill.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
think
that
it's
vague,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
requirement
of
precision
in
the
way
that
your
honor
has
articulated
it
that's
applicable
to
a
jurisdictional
element.
it's
a
federal
crime
if
you
assault
an
individual
and
it
turns
out
that
that
individual
is
an
undercover
federal
police
officer
and
you
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
until
you're
prosecuted
in
federal
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
anyone
who
commits
arson
knows
that
it's
a
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
the
jurisdictional
element
is
subject
to
a
vagueness
test
when...
when
what
congress
does
is
express
its
intent
to
go
to
the
limits
of
the
constitution
and
use
language
that
allows
this
court
to
enforce
that
limitation.
no.
there
are
many
federal
criminal
statutes
that
contain
jurisdictional
elements
like
this,
and
the
court
has
construed
those
elements
in
a
way
to
give
them
meaning,
but
not
in
a
sense
that
requires
the
actual
individual
to
appreciate
where
this
court
will
go
on
constitutional--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
court
could
adopt
a
narrower
reading
of
the
statute,
but
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
as
written
covers
the
crime
that's
prosecuted
here,
and
congress
indicated
an
intention
that
it
be
covered.
therefore,
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
it
can
constitutionally
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
word
use
is
a
broad
verb
that
intends
to
connote
the
idea
of
to
employ
or
to
put
to
service.
and
then
it
takes
from
its
context
more
specific
meanings
that
it
may
have
in
a
particular
statute.
now,
in
this
statute,
the...
the
goal
that
congress
had
in
mind
was
protect
interstate
economic
affairs
from
the
effects
of
arson
on
buildings
or
real
property
or
personal
property
that
are
used
in
activities
affecting
commerce.
so,
congress
wanted
to...
the
courts
to
identify
those
properties
that
are
used
in
activities
affecting
commerce,
and
then
it
sought
to
exert
its
power
to
protect
them.
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
i
do,
justice
scalia,
but
we
have
three
different
theories
on
how
this
building
is
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce.
the
natural
gas
theory
is
one
of
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
and
my
argument
is
not
that
the
three
together
suffice.
i
think
that
you
have
to
go
step
by
step
and
look
at
each
one.
now,
the
natural
gas
theory
is
that
because
the
house
consumes
natural
gas
that
is
supplied
by
an
interstate
natural
gas
company,
it
is
used
in
the
activity
of
natural
gas
supply.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
that
is
why
the
utility
theory
of
an
interstate
commerce
connection
is
clearly
the
broadest
of
the
three
that
we
have
relied
on
in
this
case.
and
it
would
cover
the
most
property,
and
it
would
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
think
that
the
individuals
within
the
house
would
use
milk.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
they
do.
and
i
think
that
in...
in
focusing
on
the
interstate
gas
connection,
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it.
one
is
that
the
gas
company
uses
the
property
in
its
interstate
business
by
shipping
gas
to
the
house
and
collecting
revenue
from
the
residents
or
owners.
the
other
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
the
activities
of
the
individuals
within
the
house
result
in
the
consumption
of
the
natural
gas.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
that...
if
that
were
the
basis
for
jurisdiction,
then
there
would
be
a
serious
question
whether
there's
a
logical
and
adequate
nexus
between
the
fact
that
the
house
receives
mail
and
protection
of
the
house
against
arson.
here
there
is
no
discontinuity
or
no
sense
of
disproportionality
in
the
connection
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
i
would,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
that
is
why
that
theory,
as
is
evident,
does
have
the
broadest
reach
to
it.
now,
the
other
two--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
the
gas
theory
would
cover
all...
all
vehicles.
if
the
court
disagreed
with
the
gas
theory,
then
cars
that
aren't
subject
to
outstanding
liens
or
interstate
insurance
would
not
be
covered.
cars
that...
that
are
subject
to
outstanding
liens
and
interstate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
but
this
statute
doesn't
base
jurisdiction
on
the
fact
that
the
home
was
manufactured
with
out-of-state
parts
or
out-of-state
materials,
and
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
car
was
manufactured
with
out-of-state
parts
or
materials.
it
does
look
to
the
uses
of
the
property
in
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
have
meaning
as
to
the
other
two
segments
of
the
statute,
but
i
think
that
you're
right,
justice
scalia,
that
it
would
apply
to
all
vehicles
because
of
the
gas
and
the
movement
of
the
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
again,
this
court's
decision
in
russell
makes
clear
that
it's
not
simply
the
activities
of
the
occupants
of
the
house
that
are
relevant
to
determining
whether
it's
used
in
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
the
economic
distinction
between
renting
property
and
mortgaging
property
is
not
likely
one
that
would
have
prompted
congress
to
exclude
the
coverage
of
houses
that
are
mortgaged
while
covering
houses
that
are
subject
to
rental
agreements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
that
they're
in
any
sense
being
ignored,
justice
kennedy.
in
fact,
the
local
authorities
called
upon
the
atf
to
investigate
this
crime
and
actually
requested
that
we
take
it
over
for
prosecution
because
it
involved
a
destructive
device,
a
molotov
cocktail,
in
which
the
federal
resources
and
federal
experience
was
far
greater
and,
therefore,
was
resolved
in
that
manner.
this
is
typically
the
way
that
prosecution
decisions
are
made
under
statutes
like
the
arson
statute
that
deliberately
provide
overlapping
jurisdiction
between
federal
authorities
and
state
authorities.
there
is
collaboration.
there's
cooperation,
and
in
the
norm,
there's
agreement
upon
which
body
is
the
better
to
prosecute.
and
the
fundamental
issue
i
think
here
in
federal
law
enforcement
and
criminal
law
enforcement
is
not
one
of
usurping
the
states
or
taking
away
from
them
prerogatives
that
they
wanted,
but
in
reinforcing
the
states'
desire
to
punish
and
prosecute
crime
with
the
resources
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
under
anybody's
view
of
commerce
clause
authority,
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
substantial
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
what
would
have
been
viewed
in
1789
as
local
criminal
activity.
if
an
individual
uses
a
telephone
to
make
a
threat
to
destroy
a
residence
by
fire
because
of
some
personal,
private
debt,
wholly
intrastate,
that
is
clearly
and
indisputably
covered
under
the
federal
arson
statute
because
he
has
used
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce,
the
telephone.
now,
these
jurisdictional
links
are
not
artificial
in
the
sense
that
they
are
neither
genuine,
specific,
or
concrete.
they
are
all
of
those
things.
but
they
do
clearly
allow
the
federal
government
and
the
states
to
exercise
overlapping
jurisdiction
on
a
wide
range
of
crimes.
and
that
will
be
true
whether
this
court
resolves
this
case
against
the
government
or
in
favor
of
the
government.
now,
what
i
think
that
the
court
should
do
is
recognize
that
when
congress
has
put
a
jurisdictional
element
in
it
like
this
one
and
the
government
can
satisfy
it
both
linguistically,
practically,
and
economically,
that
the
federal
authority
to
prosecute
should
be
upheld.
thank
you.
