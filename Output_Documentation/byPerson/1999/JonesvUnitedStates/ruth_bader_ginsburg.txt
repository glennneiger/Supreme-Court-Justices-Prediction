mr.
falk,
it
is
a
federal
offense
under
924(c)
that
covers
using
a
destructive
device
in
relation
to
a
crime
for
which
a
defendant
may
be
prosecuted
under
federal
law.
you
or
your
predecessor
did
not
challenge
the
conviction
under
924(c).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you're
not
conceding
the
validity
of
that
conviction?
it's
just
you
didn't
challenge
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
5861(f)
crime?
that
is
making
an
illegal
destructive
device.
that's
pretty
local
activity
too,
making
a
molotov
cocktail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
view
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
russell--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
anything
turn
on...
i
think,
wasn't
it...
wasn't
the
arsonist
the
landlord
himself?
it
was
his...
for
him
it
was
property
that
he
held
for
commercial
purposes,
income
producing
purposes,
and
i
think
that
this
wasn't
an
arsonist
of
the
kind
we
had
in
this
case.
wasn't
it
the
landlord?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if
you
were
dealing
with
fraud
on
an
insurance
company
then...
then
one
might
see
that
as
more
on
the
commercial
side
than
if
someone
is...
is
just
your
everyday
arsonist.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
on
that,
the
emphasis
on
used
in
in...
in
u.s.
v.
mennuti...
judge
friendly
thought
that
that
was
a
significant
distinction.
the
phrase,
used
in
an
activity,
was
different
from
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce.
at
least
he
thought
and
so
did
his
fellow
panel
members
that
the
used
in
made
all
the
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
could
be
that...
that
decision
certainly
was
limited
pro
tanto,
but
it
doesn't,
it
seemed
to
me,
wipe
out
entirely
the
point
that
used
in
an
activity
is
different
from
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
coupled
it...
it
coupled
it
with
business
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
would
go
for
electricity,
for
coal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
anything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there...
on
any
theory,
is
there
any
car
that
would
be
excluded
on
your
definition?
you
gave
the...
the
remote
example
of
a
building
that
might,
but
is
there
any
vehicle?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
they
were
certainly
constructed
and
manufactured...
you
could
have
a
home
that
was
built
locally,
but
for
most
automobiles
that
would
not
be
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
dewey
jones,
the
defendant
petitioner
in
this
case
was
explosively
angry
at
his
cousin
as
jones
demonstrated
by
tossing
a
molotov
cocktail
into
the
cousin’s
indiana
home.
no
one
was
injured
in
the
ensuing
blaze
but
the
dwelling
with
severely
damages.
for
that
misconduct
jones
was
indicted
under
18
u.s.c.
section
844(i)
which
makes
it
a
federal
felony
to
damage
or
destroy
by
means
of
fire
or
explosion
any
building
used
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
any
activity
affecting
such
commerce.
a
jury
found
jones
guilty
and
he
unsuccessfully
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
seeking
this
court’s
review,
jones
raised
two
questions
on
which
federal
courts
have
divided:
first,
does
the
statute,
under
which
he
was
convicted
section
844(i),
cover
arson
of
a
building
used
by
its
owner
occupant
solely
for
everyday
family
living?
second,
if
the
statute
does
cover
the
arson
of
such
a
private
residence,
does
that
coverage
exceed
the
authority
congress
has
under
article
1
of
the
constitution
to
regulate
commerce?
we
answer
the
first
question
no,
and
therefore
do
not
reached
the
second
question.
an
owner-occupied
private
residence
not
used
for
any
commercial
purpose,
we
hold
does
not
qualify
as
property
used
in
commerce
or
commerce
affecting
activity.
arson
of
such
a
dwelling
therefore
is
not
subject
to
federal
prosecution
under
section
844(i),
so
jones’
arson
conviction
must
be
vacated.
in
urging
us
to
sustain
the
conviction,
the
government
relied
on
the
breadth
of
the
statutory
terms
affecting
commerce.
those
words,
when
they
are
unqualified,
signal
congress’
intent
to
invoke
its
whole
commerce
clause
authority,
but
here
the
term
is
qualified
a
building
to
fit
within
the
statute’s
compass
must
be
used
in
a
commerce
affecting
activity.
the
government
points
specifically
to
three
commerce
affecting
uses
of
the
home
into
which
jones
threw
a
molotov
cocktail.
jones’
cousin,
in
the
government’s
view,
used
the
home
to
secure
a
mortgage,
to
obtain
a
home
owners
insurance
policy,
and
to
receive
natural
gas.
these
connections
we
conclude
were
not
the
kind
that
congress
had
in
mind.
the
word
“used”
in
legislation
as
in
conversations
ordinarily
signifies
active
employment,
it
surely
is
not
the
common
perception
that
a
private
owner
occupied
residence
is
used
in
the
activity
of
receiving
natural
gas,
a
mortgage,
or
an
insurance
policy.
the
only
active
employment
of
the
home
in
this
case
so
far
as
the
record
reveals,
was
for
the
everyday
living
of
jones’
cousin
and
his
family.
but
we
to
adopt
the
government’s
expansive
interpretation
of
section
844(i)
hardly
a
building
in
the
land
would
fall
outside
the
federal
statute’s
domain
under
section
844(i)
limiting
language
used
in
any
commerce
affecting
activity
would
have
no
significance.
our
reading
of
section
844(i)
is
reinforced
by
the
principle
that
constitutionally
doubtful
construction
should
be
avoided
where
possible.
this
court's
1995
decision
in
lopez
v.
united
states
held
that
a
statute
making
it
a
federal
crime
to
possess
a
firearm
within
1000
feet
of
school
exceeded
congress’
power
to
regulate
commerce.
lopez
brought
to
the
fore
concerns
expressed
in
earlier
cases
about
turning
traditionally
local
criminal
conduct
into
matters
for
federal
enforcement.
our
construction
of
section
844(i)
is
also
supported
by
interpretive
guides
in
the
clear
statement
category
ambiguity
concerning
the
ambit
of
a
criminal
statute
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
lenity,
when
choice
must
be
made
between
two
readings
of
what
congress
has
made
criminal,
the
harsher
alternative
should
not
be
chosen
unless
congress
has
spoken
in
definite
language,
and
when
the
congress
has
not
spoken
unambiguously
courts
will
not
attribute
to
the
legislature
a
design
to
alter
the
federal-state
balance
in
the
prosecutions
of
crime.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
in
addition,
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
