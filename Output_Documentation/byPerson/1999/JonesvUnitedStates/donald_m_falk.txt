mr.
donald
m.
falk
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
18
u.s.c.
844(i)
makes
arson
a
federal
crime
if
it
damages
property
used
in
interstate
commerce
or
property
used
in
any
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce.
the
question
here
is
whether
petitioner's
arson
of
a
private
residence
comes
within
the
statute
because
that
home
received
natural
gas
and
was
mortgaged
and
insured
by
out-of-state
firms,
and
if
so,
whether
that
application
of
the
statute
to
that
crime
is
constitutional.
in
the
government's
view,
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
enables
congress
to
make
a
federal
crime
out
of
any
act
that
threatens
or
damages
property
having
connections
to
interstate
commerce
or
that
interrupts
or
disrupts
an
ongoing
commercial
relationship
with
out-of-state
parties.
that
view
of
the
commerce
clause
would
enable
congress
to
enact
general
federal
protections
for
virtually
all
property,
including
real
property,
although
the
general
protection
of
property
is
one
of
the
most
basic
core
elements
of
an
area
of
traditional
state
concern
and
competence.
in
the
government's
view
of
the
federal
protection
of
property,
the...
congress
can
make
federal
crimes
out
of
things
like
scrawling
graffiti
or
breaking
a
window,
and
congress
has
in...
in
the
government's
view
made
federal
crimes
out
of
setting
fire
to
a
gas
barbecue
grill
or
perhaps
a
television.
and
here,
of
course,
the
government
has
prosecuted
as
a
federal
crime,
the
arson
of
a
private
residence.
the
government
has
not
identified
any
limit
on
the
federal
power
to
prohibit
arson,
although
arson
is
a
quintessentially
local
crime.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
no,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
statute
applies.
we
do
not
believe
it...
it
applies.
we
believe,
however,
that
in
reading
the
statute
in
this
case,
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
constitutional
considerations
that
would
ensue
from
applying
the
statute
in
this
case,
and
that
in
light
of
those
considerations,
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
avoid
what
we
view
as
difficult,
indeed,
doubtful
at
best,
constitutional
issues.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
we
believe
the
statutory
language
is
with
us
even
without
the
constitutional
considerations
in
the
background.
when
you
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
understanding
of...
of
the
statute,
when
you
look
at
the
normal
sense
of
what
it
means
for
property
to
be
used
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce,
which
is
the
subset
that
was
applied
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
it
requires
an
active
use
of
the
physical
property,
which
after
all,
it
is
the
damage
to
the
physical
property
that's
supposed
to
provide
the
link
to
interstate
commerce
here.
and
we
think,
in
fact,
it's
quite
telling
that
there
was
some
concern
among
some
members
of
congress
that
this
statute
did
not
reach
private
residences.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
i
don't
know
if
i'd
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
tortures
the
words
of
the
statute,
justice
kennedy,
but
it
certainly
twists
them
a
bit.
it
is
not...
it
may
be
used
in
a...
in
an
abstract
sense,
but
it
is
not
a
use
of
the
physical
property
and
it
is
the
physical
property
that
is
really
at
issue
here.
and
it's
not
a
use
in
an
activity.
getting
a
mortgage
is
a...
is
a
single
transaction
rather
than
an
activity.
and
this
is...
this
court
has
a
long
history
and
congress
has
a
long
history
of
using
the
word
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce
to
mean
an
enterprise--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
we
believe
that...
that
in
the
normal
diction,
in
the
normal,
ordinary
understanding
of
those
words,
when
they're
read
entirely
in
context,
property
used
in
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce,
that
is
required,
and
we
think
that's
reinforced
by
the...
by
the...
the
sense
that
the
congress
that
passed
this
statute
apparently
had.
as
i
said,
there
were
people
that
were
concerned
that
this
statute
should
reach
residences,
but
no
one--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
we
think
this
case
is...
is
quite
clearly
distinct
from
the
russell
case
because
in
that
case,
the
landlord
was
using
the
property...
was
bartering
the
occupancy
of
the
property
for
a
generation
of
income,
very
much
like...
like
what
was
going
on
in...
in
the
smith
case
where
you
were
trading
something
to
get
income,
allowing
people
to
come
in
and
occupy
the
property.
and
those
people
were
paying
for
the
privilege.
we
think
that...
that
is...
is
a
difference
and
it's
a
recognized
difference
in
common
speech.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
even
so--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--we
do
not
believe
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
the...
subjecting
the
house
to
a
security
interest
is
not
the
kind
of
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce,
the
continuous
sort
of
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce,
that
this
court
and...
and
congress
in
its
other
statutes
has...
has
repeatedly
taken
those
words
to
mean.
and
no
one...
we
would
point
out
no
one
in...
in
these
debates
where
people
said
let's
apply
this
to
residences,
how
can
we
do
it.
no
one
said,
oh,
the
statute
already
applies.
of
course,
any
house
with
a
mortgage
is
being
used
in
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce.
any
house
that
is
insured
is
being
used
in
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce,
and
any
house
that
receives
utilities
is
being
used
in
such
an
activity.
nobody...
nobody
in
the
congress
thought
that,
not
even
the
most...
most
fervent
believers
in
applying
this
statute
to
residences,
they
could
find
a
way.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
we
are
conceding
that...
that
it
is
not
torturing
the
language,
in
justice
kennedy's
words,
to
say
that
it
is
used
in
some
sense.
you
are
using
the
house
to
get
a
mortgage.
that
is--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--no.
let
me...
i
don't
believe
you
can
parse
word
by
word
in
a
statute
without
taking
the
word...
the
words
in
context
together.
i
don't
think
there
is
meaning
to
say
it
is
used
but
not
used
in
an
activity.
it
is
either
used
in
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce
or
not.
it
can't
be
used
or
not
in
that...
used
but
not
used
in
an
activity.
it's...
only
a
use
in
an
activity
counts
here.
so
that
we
don't
think
it...
it
is
not
the
kind
of
use
that
the
statute
covers,
and
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
i
agree
it...
it
is
not--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
justice
scalia,
when
you
get
back
to
the
attempt
to
draw
some
nexus
between
this
very
basic
state
common
law
crime
in
interstate
commerce,
when
a
building
is
being
rented
out,
it
is
being
used
in
what
is
recognized
as
a
commercial
activity.
as
in
russell,
you
could
take
a
commercial
tax
deduction
for
it.
it
is
a
difference.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
it
is
a
foundation
of
the
american
economy.
that
may
be.
however,
the
home
ownership
itself
is
not...
is
about
as
local
an
activity
as
you
can
get
and
has...
has
never
been
considered
to
be
an
activity
affecting
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
market,
the
transactions,
of
course,
could
be...
can
be
considered
activities
affecting
interstate
commerce.
but
the
mere
ownership
itself
has...
has
not
been
that
way.
and
that...
it
seems
to
us
that...
that
even
though
concededly
the
line
is...
is
not
the...
is
not
the
line
that
we
would
have
drawn,
were
we
enacting
the
statute,
that
because,
at
least
in
this
case,
which
is
an
easy
case
in
our
view,
you
can
avoid
substantial
constitutional
issues,
substantial
constitutional
concerns
when
congress
appears...
at
least
congress
and
the
executive
and
the
lower...
some
of
the
lower
courts
together
appear
to
be
asserting
what
amounts
to
pretty
much
plenary
jurisdiction
over
one
of
the
most
basic
common
law
crimes
that
drawing
a
line
that
is
permitted
by
the
words
of
the
statute
and
that
at
least
accords
with
this
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
to
some
extent
as
a
first
step--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--i
agree
that
the
statute
applies.
i
mean,
russell...
russell
says
it.
yes.
i
do
not
necessarily
agree
that
there
is
congressional
power
to
prevent
that
arson.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
because
russell
was
a
statutory
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
not
challenged
in
there.
now,
certainly...
certainly--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
certainly
not
under
the
current...
under
the
current
articulation
of
this
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
now,
skyscrapers...
i
mean,
it
depends
what's
going
on
in
the
skyscraper.
it
seems
to
us--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
that
would
be
a
stretch
beyond
the
current...
this
court's
current
commerce
clause
decisions.
this
court
has
recognized
congressional
power
to
protect
property
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause
only
in
the
case
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
and
in
the
case
of
persons
or
things...
things,
for
property
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
it
would
be
a
stretch
to
say
that
congress
also
can
protect
property
because
it
is
commercially
used.
that,
we
believe,
goes
beyond
the
current
state
of
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
however,
to
say
that
commercial
property
can
be
protected,
if
it's
actively
in
commercial
use
and...
and
residential
or
inactively
used
or
non-used
property
cannot,
would
be
at
least
the
line
that
is
coherent
in...
in
a...
that...
that
corresponds
to
the
line
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
activity
that
this
court
has
reemphasized
based
on
the
text
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
without
a
federal
offense
in
most
instances
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
probably
could,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
without
a...
without
a...
it
being
a
federal
offense,
yes.
there
are
some
churches
that
might...
without
getting
into
the
details--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i...
i
know
there
used
to
be
a...
it
used
to
be
a
federal
offense
to
import
clergymen,
but
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
federal
offense
to
kill
them.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
we
believe
that
the
924(c)
conviction
ceases
to
have
foundation
if
the
844(i)
conviction,
on
which
it
was
based,
disappears.
there
is
no--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--it
was
not
directly
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
correct.
we
are
not
conceding.
in
fact,
we...
we
mentioned
in
our...
in
both
the
petition
and
our
opening
brief
in
this
case
that
if
the
844(i)
conviction
is
found
to
have
been
beyond
the
scope
of
the
statute
or
beyond
congress'
power,
then
the
924(c)
conviction
falls
of
its
own
weight.
the
only
predicate
crime
for
the
924(c)
conviction
was
the
844(i)
conviction.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
that
was
not
a
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals,
nor
is
it
dependent
on
the
844(i)
conviction.
so,
mr.
jones--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
my
view
of
that
is
that
it
is
justified...
it...
it
may
be
constitutional
as
a...
basically
as
a
sort
of
channels...
channels
regulation,
as
part
of
a
licensing
scheme
which
ensures
that
explosives
that
travel
in
interstate
commerce
are
taken
care
of
in
a
particular
way.
and
as
part
of
that...
rational
part
of
that
licensing
scheme,
the
best
argument
for
the
constitutionality
of...
of
this
provision
is
that
congress
can
require
people
who
make
these
things
to
be
licensed.
mr.
jones
was
not
licensed,
and
as
a
result,
he
would
be
subject
to
a...
to
a
federal
punishment.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
not
all...
i
don't
believe
all
the
items
that
are
covered
within
the
destructive
devices
definition
have
been
excluded
from
interstate
commerce.
i
don't
believe
that
one
can
get
a
license
to
transport
the
particular
destructive
device
in
this
case,
a
molotov
cocktail,
and
in
that
sense
it...
it
is
rational.
and
it
can
be...
and
i
believe
it...
this
could
be
justified
because
even
if
the
devices
are
not
excluded
from
interstate
commerce,
their
transport
is
regulated
and
their
trade
is
regulated.
and...
and
as
part
of
that,
congress
requires
people
who
make
them
or
transport
them
to
be
licensed.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
within...
within
the
federal
scheme,
there
are...
i
believe...
i
believe
there
is
a
tracking
mechanism.
the
people
have
to
report
certain
things.
they
have
to
tell
authorities
where
things
go
and...
and
when
they
go.
as
i
say,
not
with
molotov
cocktails.
i
don't
think
you
can
get
a
license
to
do
anything
with
them.
and
in
fact,
those
are
excluded
from
interstate
commerce,
but
there
is...
there
is
a
scheme
dealing
with
the
transport
of...
of
some
of
these
devices.
there
is
not
a
scheme
dealing
with
their
use.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
yes,
justice
breyer--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--it
has
an
effect,
but
it
is
not
a
substantial
effect--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
two
answers
to
that.
first,
that
is
the
exact
cost
of
crime
reasoning
that
the
court
rejected
in
lopez.
yes,
all
crime...
all
crime
is
expensive.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
i
don't
think
it's
a
substantial
qualitative
effect.
it's
not
a...
substantially
related
to
interstate
commerce
in
the
way
that
this
court--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--that
is
not
substantial
in
the
qualitative
sense
that
controls
the
constitutional
issue
any
more
than
the
additive
value
of
every
theft
in
the
country
is...
is
substantial
in
that
case.
yes,
of
course,
there
are
high
economic
costs
of
all
crime.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
in
quantitative
amount,
as
it
happens,
the...
the
total
value
of
residential
arsons
in
the
country
nationwide...
the
last
count
i
think
was
around
the
200
to
250
million
dollar
range,
and
i
think
there
is
an
argument
that
for
a
nationwide--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--no.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
no,
you
cannot
aggregate
this.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
and
the
reason
you
cannot--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--okay.
you--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--i
don't
think
aggregation
works
here.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
yes,
i
see
your
point,
and...
and--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--yes.
i...
i...
basically
yes
because
these
are
not
the
kinds...
this
is
not
an
economic
regulation
or
regulation
of
economic
activity.
this
is
a
dispersed
activity.
there
is
no
general
either
power
or
existing
scheme.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
now,
you're
talking
about
russell?
mr.
donald
m.
falk
which
is
a
duplex.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
yes,
yes.
well,
my
understanding
of
russell
is
that
it
had
been
rented
and
that
it...
that
it...
but...
but
regardless,
i
don't
think
it...
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
with
great
deference,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
reference
in
russell
to
aggregation
was
neither
necessary
to
the
opinion
nor
correct
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
it
was
a
statutory
opinion.
we
believe
that
we
have
set
out
a
rationale
under
which
it...
it
can
be
fit
within
the
statutory
language,
as
did
the
opinion,
and
the
fact
that
there's
a
reference
to
aggregation
does
not
control
the
constitutionality
of
that
aggregation
here.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
well,
i...
if
i
suggested
that
it's
used
for
a
mortgage
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
i
certainly
misspoke.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
under
russell,
and
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
the
commercial
use
of
the
property--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--justice
scalia,
in
a
vacuum
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you.
however,
i
think
there
is
a...
a
principal
distinction
between
this
case
and
russell
so
that...
that
russell
does
not
have
to
be
overruled
as
a
statutory
decision--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--in
order
to
put
this
case
outside
the
line.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
it
was
the
landlord,
your
honor,
and
i...
i...
although
it
is
neither
an
element
of
the
statute,
nor
i
think
clearly
in
the
opinion,
if
it's
in
there
at
all,
it...
it,
you
know,
probably
was
an
arson
for
profit
of
some
sort.
but
it
was
not...
the
case
did
not
turn
on
that.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
oh,
absolutely.
as
a
constitutional
matter...
matter,
justice
ginsburg,
it...
if
congress
enacted
a
statute
that
made
arson,
with
the
intent
to
defraud
an
insurance
company
or
an
interstate
insurance
company,
a
federal
crime,
it
would
be
much,
much
closer
and...
and
probably
could
be
drafted
in
such
as
way
as...
as
to
come
within
the
constitutional
power.
but
that's
not
what
this
statute...
that's
not
the
nexus
that
this
statute
draws.
the
nexus
that
this
statute
draws
is
not
related
to
intent.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
right.
that
is
the...
that
is
the
type
of
commercial
activity
that
in...
in
normal
parlance
is
understood
as
a...
as
a
commercial
action,
renting
out
property
for
profit.
living
in
a
house
is
not.
it
seems,
as
i
say,
without
a...
if
russell
was
not
on
the
books
and...
and
this
case
presented
those
issues,
then...
then
i
might
argue
something
to
the
contrary.
but
russell--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--this
is
correct.
and
in
fact,
it
would
be...
the
court
would
have
to...
in
the
first
instance,
to
get
to
the
constitutional
issue,
would
have
to
construe
the
statute
in
a
way
that
is
broader
than...
than
russell
construed
it.
and
then
it
would...
of
course,
as
you
suggested,
it
would
get
to
the
constitutional
issue,
find
this
general
property
protection
power
not
to
exist,
and
then
construe
the
statute
more
narrowly,
in...
in
a
way
backing
out.
the
court
could
certainly
follow
that
rationale.
but
first
it
would
have
to
say,
well,
it
looks
to
us
that
russell
is
not
only
right,
but
it
was...
that
it...
the
statute
reads
more
broadly
than
that.
but
that,
of
course,
would
lead
to
the
difficult
constitutional
questions,
and...
and
the
government
here
is
asserting
a
power
to
protect
property
that
would
sweep
far
beyond
anything
this
court
has
ever
recognized.
it
would--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--yes.
i--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--the
owner
was
engaged
in
an
activity
affecting
commerce.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
justice
stevens,
i
have
stood
up
here
to
say
that
russell
is
not
bad
statutory
law.
we
still
believe
that
it
goes
beyond
what
this
court...
that
if
you--
mr.
donald
m.
falk
--well,
because
this
is
not
part
of
a
scheme
of
protecting
or
regulating
a
market.
there
is
no
scheme
for
regulating
the
real
estate
market.
and,
in
fact,
arson
is
simply
the...
the
destruction
of
property,
which
property
is
everywhere.
property
is
used
in
every
business.
congress
cannot
possibly
have
the
power
to
make
shoplifting
a
federal
crime
because
the...
the
shopkeeper
is
engaged
in
a
business.
and...
and
with
arson
it's
no
different.
there
has
to
be
some
more
substantial,
qualitatively
substantial,
nexus
than
that.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
m.
falk
there
are
deep
and
significant
concerns
about
our
federal
system
that
are
posed
by
this
case.
they
are
not
solved
by
the
fact
that
the
state
authorities
asked
the
federal
authorities
to
participate
because
we
are
talking
about
what
kind
of
power
may
be
exercised
and
how.
the
federal
authorities
under
the
spending
clause
certainly
could
have
assisted
the
states
in
the
investigation
of
this
crime.
there
was,
of
course,
an
eye
witness
who
knew
the...
the
perpetrator,
but
that...
that
could
be
done
under
the
spending
clause,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
real
serious
debate
that
the
federal
authorities
could
not
assist
in
these
investigations.
but
when
it
is
asserted
that
the
federal
government
has
power
to
protect
property,
not
instrumentalities
or
items
in
interstate
commerce,
but
all
property,
based
on
a
conception
that
was
developed
for
ways
of
regulating
ways
of
doing
business
that
have
intermingled
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
and
then
it
is
justified
because
there
is
a
jurisdictional
element,
which
serves
as
a
sort
of
logic
puzzle
that
if
the
federal
government
and
the
prosecutors
can
figure
out
a
way
to
get
past
a
compliant
lower
court,
it's
just
a
way
of
putting
the
pieces
together
on
everything
in
the
most
basic
state
crime...
areas
of
the
state
crime
and
the
state
power
come
under
federal
power,
then
it's
okay.
these
i
think
raise
significant
problems
that
don't
need
to
be
addressed
here.
under
russell,
even
under
russell,
which
i
think
gives
us
a
good
working
starting
place
in
this...
on
this...
on
this
issue,
the
statutory
issue...
russell,
by
the
way,
justice
breyer,
when
the
early
sentence
says
that
mr.
russell
did
earn
rental
income.
so,
in
fact,
the...
the
it's
not
clear
whether
he
earned
at
that
minute,
but
the
building
was...
had
been
actually
rented.
it
was
not
merely
on
the
market.
but
this
court
said,
yes,
there's
this
legislative
history
that
suggests
they're
going
all
the
way,
but
it
also
says
substantially
all
business
property.
and
in
any
event,
let's
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
what
do
those
mean.
and
here
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
words
first.
the
government
says
that
this
business
purposes
amendment
means
that
congress
meant
to
cover
everything.
well,
one
thing
it
could
not
have
meant
to
get
by
drafting
that
language
is
the
sort
of
idea
that
the
mortgage
company
is
using
the
house,
because
if
the
mortgage
company
or
the
insurer
or
the
utility
company
or
any
of
those
people
are
using
structures,
then
they
are
certainly
using
them
for
business
purposes,
and
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
need
to
draft
this...
draft
this
language
at
all.
it
would
have
been
already
covered.
everything
would
have
been
covered.
it
makes
no
sense.
instead,
the...
the
people
on...
on
whom...
the
members
on
whom
the
government
relies
kept
coming
back
saying,
let's
find
a
way
to
get
residences,
and
others
are
saying,
well,
it's
constitutionally
doubtful.
and
representative
hungate
proposes
at
the
last
minute,
here's
another
way.
it's
constitutionally
doubtful
in
a
different
way
because
of
the
presumption.
but
it
will
get
residences.
it
will
get
the...
it
will
get
these
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
and
congress
said
no.
congress
chose
these
words
not
because
it
was
going...
trying
to
exercise
the
absolute,
utmost
possibility
of
the
commerce
power,
but
because
it
thought
if
we
choose
this...
these
words
carefully,
if
we
structure
this
statute
carefully,
we
will
exercise
as
much
of
the
power
as
we
can
get
but
stay
within
constitutional
limits.
and
those
limits
do
not
reach
this
case.
it...
it...
thank
you.
