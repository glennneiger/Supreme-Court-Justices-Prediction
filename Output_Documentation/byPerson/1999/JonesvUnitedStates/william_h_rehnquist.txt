99-5739,
dewey
jones
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
falk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish...
excuse
me.
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
the
russell
case,
mr.
falk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
falk,
if
you're
going
to
argue
statutory
construction,
you
have
to
accept
the
holding
in
russell,
don't
you,
that
where
the
property
is...
is
leased
for
production
of
revenue,
then
it
is
covered
by
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
falk.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dreeben,
i
wouldn't...
i
have
read
russell
to...
i...
i
grant
you
it
says
that,
but
i...
i
wouldn't
have
read
russell
to
say
that
it
meant
to
push
the
word
used
in
the
statute
to
the
limit
of
the
word
use.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
an
example
like
a
gun-free
school
district?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
connection
with
a
church?
i
mean,
what
if
the
hymnals
cross
state
lines?
would
that
be
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
are
you
saying
that
the
jurisdictional
element
is
not
subject
to
any
sort
of
a
vagueness
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
milk
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
and
drunk
by
people
who
live
in
the
house?
would
you
say
that
the
house...
that
the
house
uses
milk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
individuals
in
the
house
use
the
heat,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
falk,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
falk.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-5739,
jones
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
