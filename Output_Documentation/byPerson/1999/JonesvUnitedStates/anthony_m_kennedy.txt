would
it
torture
the
words
of
the
statute
to
say
that
the
home
was
used
to
obtain
a
mortgage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
acknowledge
that
in
the
ordinary
sense
you
use
the
mortgage
to
get
the
house.
you
don't
use
the
house
to
get
the
mortgage.
i
can
understand
that.
but
i'm
not
sure
the
statute
necessarily
requires
us
to
reach
that
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
a
burglary
statute,
if
there's
a
federal
burglary
statute,
you
would
come
with
statistics
as
to
how
much
insurance
companies
have
to
pay
every
year
in
the
aggregate
for
household
burglaries,
and
you'd
make...
you'd
make
the
submission
that
this
is
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
that's
measurable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you...
in
any...
any
burglary
that's
insured,
other
than
the
deductible,
if
it's
a...
there's
going
to
be
payment
from
an
interstate
insurer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
seem
to
you
that
the
categories
we've
been
discussing
are
really
somewhat
remote
from
what
the
framers
sought
to
accomplish
when
they
set
up
the
federal
system,
which
is
to
allow
people
to
realize
that
there's
a
government
that's
not
remote
from
them
that
they
can
control?
here
the
sentence
was
for
30
years.
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
why
this...
this
crime
happened,
but
the
homeowner
himself
argued
before
the
sentencing
court,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
sentence
was
too...
too
strong.
and
yet,
this
very
remote
federal
sentencing
scheme
comes
into
play
in
what
is
ordinarily
a
common
law
crime.
and
none
of
the
responses
you've
given,
perhaps
none
of
the
questions
we
have
asked,
seemed
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
strong,
local
interest
here
that's
just
simply
being
ignored.
