mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
a
citizen's
suit
under
the
clean
water
act
must
be
dismissed
as
moot
if
the
district
court
concludes
that
injunctive
relief
is
unwarranted.
the
clean
water
act
authorizes
private
citizens
to
bring
suit
to
abate
ongoing
violations,
and
it
provides
the
district
courts
with
two
types
of
coercive
remedies
to
compel
compliance.
the
district
court
may
ask
for
civil
penalties,
or
it
may
grant
civil
penalties,
or
it
may
issue
an
injunction,
and
that
choice
lies
with
the
discretion,
the
remedial
discretion,
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
properly
exercised
its
discretion
in
this
case.
the
citizens
brought
suit
to
abate
ongoing
violations,
and
the
court
determined
that
they
were
entitled
to
relief.
the
court
declined
to
enter
an
injunction
in
light
of
laidlaw's
current
compliance
status
at
the
time
of
judgment,
but
it
nevertheless
concluded
that
civil
penalties
were
appropriate,
because
they
would
deter
future
violations
by
laidlaw
at
that
site.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
your
honor.
i
think
if
we
look
at
cases
involving
voluntary
cessation,
ranging
from
gwaltney
to
city
of
mesquite,
w.
t.
grant,
all
of
those
cases
recognized
that
a
case
might
not
be
moot,
but
nevertheless
injunction
relief
may
nevertheless
not
be
warranted.
what
has
happened
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
do
not
think
it's
extraordinary,
because
the
court
would
not
have
simply
wagged
its
finger
at
laidlaw.
an
injunction
in
this
case
could
have,
most
likely
would
have
intruded
the
court
into
the
operations
of
laidlaw.
for
instance,
an
injunctive
could
have
limited
the
amount
of
feed
that
goes
into
the
incinerator,
it
could
have
specified
the
type
of
equipment
that
laidlaw
had
to
use,
all
of
these
things
are
quite
burdensome
and
intrusive.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
need
not
have,
but
this
is
why
congress
gave
courts
the
power
to
select
the
remedy
that
is
most
appropriate
to
ensure
compliance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
its--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
not
what
the
court
did
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
made
quite--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
made
quite
clear
its
view
on
the
use
of
civil
penalties,
and
this
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
121
through
125.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
what
they
said,
what
the
court
said
was
that
civil
penalties
here
are
available
to
deter
future
violations,
and
they
do
so
by
depriving--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
this
case,
that
is
the
approach
the
court
took,
and
what's
more,
the
court
said
the
reason
why
it
deters
is
because
it
will
deprive
the
party
of
the
economic
benefit
of
noncompliance
and
thereby
take
away
the
incentive
to
commit
future
violations.
laidlaw
was
clearly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
penalty
deprived
laidlaw
of
its...
of
the
benefits
of
its
past
noncompliance--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
made
clear
that
its
future
violations--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
it's
the
application
of
the
penalty
that
provides
the
assurance
that
it
will
be
applied
in
the
future
as
well.
a
penalty
that
is
never
applied,
of
course,
has
no
deterrent
effect.
this
penalty...
and
one
only
needs
to
think
in
terms
of
the
practical
aspects.
the
plant
manager
is
facing
the
prospect,
we
can
increase
our
profits
by
increasing
the
throughput
in
our
incinerator,
but
we're
going
to
violate
our
permit
if
we
do
that.
he
talks
to
his
lawyer,
asks
the
lawyer,
what
would
be
the
consequences.
if
he's
told,
well,
you
might
simply
get
an
injunction
telling
you
not
to
do
again...
do
it
again,
the
company
will
have
a
strong
incentive
to
go
ahead
and
violate
and
make
those
profits.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
counsel
says,
well,
the
last
time
you
did
this
you
paid
a
penalty
that
took
away
all
the
economic
benefits
of
violating
that
permit,
that
operates
as
a
powerful
deterrent,
and
that
is
what
we
believe
the
district
court
was
seeking
to
do
in
this
particular
case.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize,
and
laidlaw
concedes,
the
district
court
had
not
declined
to
provide
injunctive
relief
on
the
ground
that
defendant's
compliance
efforts
had
made
this
case
moot.
this
court's
decisions,
including
gwaltney,
made
clear
that
voluntary
cessation
of
unlawful
conduct
does
not
moot
a
case
unless
it's
absolutely
clear
there's
no
reasonable
prospect
for
continuance.
laidlaw
did
not
argue
or
demonstrate
that
there
was
mootness
of
that
sort
in
this
case,
and
so
for
that
reason
the
court
was
free
to
apply
the
remedy
that
it
thought
was
appropriate
to
abate
future
violations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
our
view
is,
we
might
very
well
be
entitled
to
the
money,
and
the
analysis
goes
as
follows.
if
the
plant
had
closed
before
judgment,
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
then
in
that
situation,
if
that
eliminates
all
possibility
of
future
violations,
then
the
case
is
moot,
and
the
case
should
just
be
dismissed.
i'm
talking
about
the
district
court
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i'm
talking
about,
in
that
case
before
the
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
the
plant
is
closed
after--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
one
of
the
inquiries
that
has
to
be
made
on
remand
is
whether
that
closure
was
prompted
by
the
court's
judgment.
if
the
judgment
actually
was
effective--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
it's
clearly
moot,
and
it
was
not
caused
by
the...
the
closing
was
not
caused
by
the
entry
of
the
judgment,
in
that
case
we
think
the
appropriate
course
would
be
under
bonner
mall
and
the
walling
v.
reuter
case
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
the
reimposition
of
the
district
court's
judgment,
and
that's
governed
by--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--reimpose
the
district
court's
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they'd
have
to
pay
the
money.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
reason
for
that
is
simply
as
a
matter
of
interest
of
justice.
as
this
court
indicated
in
bonner
mall,
if
a
defendant
actually
precludes
the
other
party
from
obtaining
relief
in
this
court,
the
appropriate
course
in
the
interests
of
justice
is
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
reason
why
the
penalty
is
still
enforced
in
that
situation
is
to
avoid
the
gamesmanship
that
would
otherwise
result.
if
a
party,
a
defendant
could
simply
string
the
litigation
along
until
it
becomes
moot
and
then
avoid
the
civil
penalties
that
are
imposed--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
in
fact
the
walling
case
involved
the
imposition
of
an
injunction,
and
the
injunction
was
on
appeal
to
this
court.
it
had
been
granted
in
the
district
court,
it
had
been
overturned
in
the
court
of
appeals.
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
pending
before
the
court,
the
defendant
corporation
dissolved,
and
this
court
said,
in
that
situation
we're
nevertheless
going
to
reinstate
the
district
court
judgment
and
allow
the
parties
to
determine
in
the
district
court
what
remedies
are
available
in
that
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
the
injunction
was
still
reinstituted,
and
the
court
indicated
it
would
be
up
to
the
parties
to
determine
what
could
be
enforced
in
that
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
now,
i
understand
justice
scalia's
concern
is,
if
the
case
is
truly
moot,
why
does
the
injunction
continue,
but
nevertheless,
what
the
court
said
is,
when
the
case
became
moot
on
the
way
to
the
supreme
court,
it
had
the
discretion
to
determine
what
to
do
with
the
case
on
remand.
now,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
deterrent
value
of
the
penalties
that
are
at
issue
here,
because
i
think
this
is
an
important
point
for
this
court
to
understand.
it
has
indicated
in
a
number
of
its
cases
the
value
of,
the
deterrent
value
of
civil
penalties.
in
gwaltney,
the
court
said
that
citizens
may
seek
penalties
only
in
a
suit
brought
to
enjoin
or
otherwise
abate
an
ongoing
violation.
in
other
words,
gwaltney
recognized
that
civil
penalties
are
available
to
abate
the
violation.
in
addition,
this
court
said
in
tull
that
courts
can
deter
future
violations
by
basing
the
penalty
on
its
economic
impact,
exactly
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case,
and
in
romero-barcelo,
this
court
said
that
an
injunction
is
not
the
only
means
of
ensuring
compliance,
citing
to
civil
penalties.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
steel
company
is
distinguishable,
because
in
that
case...
if
i
may
finish
my
answer...
it
involved
a
wholly
past
violation
in
which
civil
penalties
would
have
no
future
deterrent
effect.
thank
you,
your
honor.
