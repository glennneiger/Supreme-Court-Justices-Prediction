mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
this
court
in
somewhat
of
an
odd
posture
in
that
we
are
here,
in
the
eighth
year
of
this
litigation,
because
the
petitioners
want
this
court
to
send
all
of
us
back
to
the
fourth
circuit
to
litigate
the
issue
of
additional
civil
penalties
for
violations,
some
of
which
occurred
nearly
13
years
ago,
none
of
which
caused
any
measurable
environmental
harm,
based
on
the
petitioner's
contention
that
such
additional
penalties
for
long-past
violations
will
somehow
deter
future
discharges
at
a
facility
in
south
carolina
that
no
longer
discharges,
and
they
ask
for
this
relief
despite
two
very
important
facts.
one,
they
admit
that
at
trial
they
completely
failed
to
prove
specific
adverse
effects
to
the
environment,
and
secondly,
whatever
injuries
that
they
may
have
had,
they
now
concede
were
redressed
by
the
district
court's
ruling
in
1997.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
it
was
the
district
court's
1997
ruling
on
liability.
there
was
an
earlier
1995
ruling
called
the
preclusion
ruling
that
said
the
lawsuit
could
go
forward.
we
then
tried
the
case,
and
the
district
court
ruled
in
1997,
found
violations,
and
imposed
the
penalty.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean...
yes.
that's
our
position,
that
under
no
circumstances
should
a
private
party
be
able
to
seek
penalties,
a
remedy
in
which
that
private
party
has
no
personal
stake,
because
there's
just
no
good
historical
analogue
in
the
federal
system
for
a
private
party
doing
that.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
think
in
state
law...
obviously,
the
federal
system
has
a
separation
of
power
consideration
that
state
law
doesn't.
in
a
qui
tam
action,
obviously
the
plaintiff,
who
is
suing
on
behalf
of
the
government,
at
least
gets
a
portion
of
the
take.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
well,
to
answer
the
first
part
of
it,
if
you
got
$13.50
out
of
a
million
dollar
judgment,
i'm
not
sure
that's
enough
of
a
personal
stake,
but
i
know--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--no,
it's
not,
your
honor,
and
there's
a
lot
of--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--it
has
not,
and...
but
my
point
is
that
at
least
that
qui
tam
plaintiff
has
some
personal
stake
by
virtue
of
the
statute,
the
false
claims
act,
giving
that
quit
tam
plaintiff
a--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--i'll
agree
with
that,
although
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
don't
think
that's
completely
correct,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
the
district
court
denied
the
injunction
for
very
good
reasons.
the
citizens'
suit
was
filed
in
june
of
1992.
two
months
later,
as
the
district
court
found,
the
company
was
in
substantial
compliance.
the
district
court
found
that
5
years
prior
to
the
citizens'
suit
there
was
continuous
activity
on
the
part
of
the
company,
good
faith
compliance
efforts,
working
with
the
state,
and
that
the
citizens'
suit
basically
came
in
at
the
end
of
that
process,
so
the
district
court
felt
that
because
this
was
not
an
indifferent
company
that
was
galvanized
into
action
by
the
citizens'
suit,
and
because
it
came
into
substantial
compliance
within
2
months
of
the
citizens'
suit
by
finally
figuring
out
the
technology
problem,
there
really
wasn't
a
need
for
an
injunction.
the
district
court...
and
that's
just
obvious
from
the
record,
and--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--the
district
court
did
not
find
that.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
state's
prior
enforcement
of
these
same
penalties
was
not
diligent,
based
primarily
on
the
district
court's
feeling
that
the
penalty,
$100,000
that
the
state
imposed
upon
laidlaw,
was
not
sufficient
because
it
did
not
calculate
or
attempt
to
recover
a
theoretical
economic
benefit
of
noncompliance.
going
back
to
your
earlier
question,
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
this
citizens'
suit
was
the
catalyst
for
laidlaw
coming
into
compliance.
in
fact,
the
district
court
found
that
when
the
state
sued
laidlaw
and
entered
a
consent
decree
on
june
10,
1992,
in
order
to
obey
that
consent
decree,
laidlaw
shut
down
for
substantial
periods
of
time.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
the
district
court
did
say
that,
and
it
underscores
the
uncertain
nature
of
penalties.
our
position
is
very
clearly,
the
penalties
are
clearly
the
central
issue.
they
cannot
find
redress
in
a
compensatory
fashion.
everybody
agrees
to
that,
because
they're
paid
to
the
sovereign.
the
only
way
you
get
there
is
through
deterrence,
and
historically,
of
course,
equity
provides
a
personal
redress,
declaratory
judgments
and
injunctions
which
are
designed
specifically
for
that
purpose.
here,
a
penalty
is
overly
broad.
mr.
minear
mentioned
the
tull
case.
the
tull
case
points
out
multiple
objectives,
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
simply,
or
in
any
case,
while
you
may
easily
say,
and
i
would
agree,
that
penalties
as
a
general
matter
have
some
general
deterrent
effect,
any
legislation
with
some
type
of
penalty
or
sanction
is
going
to
have
a
general,
nonspecific
effect,
but
to
try
to
predict
the
specific
effect
becomes
a
very
cumbersome
and
a
very
difficult
proposition,
and
nothing...
and
that's
shown
in
this
case.
and
i
think
congress
recognized
that
when
they...
in
the
clean
water
act
citizen
suit
provision,
because
they
lump
penalties
and
injunctive
relief
together.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
what
i
mean,
your
honor,
is
to
redress
an
injury
under
article
iii,
it...
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
is
to
show
that
the
relief
requested,
that
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
that
relief
will
redress
that
injury.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
oh,
indeed
i
do.
i
think
these
penalties
imposed
here
had
no
deterrent
effect.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes,
because
looking
at
this...
deterrence
to
me
implies,
someone
doesn't
want
to
do
something
that's
right,
and
you
have
to
goad
them
into
it.
based
on
this
record,
including
the
5
years
of
continuous
effort
before
the
citizens'
suit,
you
cannot
draw
that
conclusion,
and
that's
why,
in
fact,
the
district
court
lowered
the
penalty
below
this
calculated
economic
benefit,
because
laidlaw's
compliance
efforts
had
been
in
good
faith,
had
not
caused
environmental
harm,
and
had--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--no,
he
didn't,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
you
read
that
correctly,
your
honor.
you're
reading
from
the
1995
district
court
opinion,
where
the
district
court
very
forcefully
said,
to
be
an
effective
deterrent,
a
penalty
must
remove
the
economic
benefit.
at
that
point
you're
at
a
wash,
and
then
some,
to
make
it
a
true
penalty.
in
the
1997
decision,
the
economic
benefit
was
$1.1
million.
the
penalty
was
$405,000.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
no,
that's
what
he
agreed.
they
argued
it
was--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--i
think,
three
or
four
million
we,
of
course,
were
lower,
and
he...
we
were,
like,
at
$900,000.
he
said
1.1,
but
i'm
going
to
penalize
you
less
than
half
of
that
because
of
these
mitigating
factors,
and
that's
in
fact...
that
was,
of
course,
the
basis
of
friends
of
the
earth's
appeal
in
the
fourth
circuit,
that
that
penalty
was
not
only
a
nonpenalty,
but
it
had
the
opposite
effect.
it
encouraged
and
rewarded
violations.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
he
did.
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes.
he
said
this
$400,000,
when
coupled
with
what
we
might
have
to
pay,
and
what
they
paid
me--
[laughter]
--that
that,
all
taken
together,
would,
he
believed
would
be
a
deterrent.
but
what
that
shows,
your
honor,
is
that
the
penalty
wasn't,
in
the
district
court's
mind,
a
sufficient
deterrent,
because
he
had
to
add
other
things
to
it.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
well,
in
equity,
clearly
you
have,
you
know,
an
injunction.
clearly
a
court
has
the
power
to
enforce
that
injunction
with
coercive
fines.
in
this
case,
under
the
clean
water
act,
these
penalties
from
the
district
court,
90
percent,
97
percent
i
think
of
the
penalties
were
pre-complaint.
these
penalties
were
completely
retrospect...
retroactive,
going
to
the...
not
prospective,
punishing
for
past
conduct,
and
that's
the
basis--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--i
don't
think
it's
fair.
it's
not...
for
this
reason.
the
district
court
said
that
the
clean
water
act
mandates
that
i
award
a
penalty,
and
that
is
the
reason,
if
you
look
at
the
entire
record,
he
felt
obligated
to
do
it.
indeed,
by
the
language
that
was--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--he
found
violations.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
think
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
right.
continuing
violations,
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit,
i
think
under
article
iii
that
penalties
are
simply
unavailable
to
a
private
party.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
think
as
a
statutory
matter--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--they
did.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
no,
i
don't,
unless
you
over...
of
course,
if
you
reverse
the
fourth
circuit,
then
you
can
obviously
take
up
the
standing
issue
and
the
statutory
issue
raised
in
the
briefs,
or
you
could
remand
it.
we
would
prefer
that
this
court
take
it
up.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
in
a
nonspecific,
attenuated
fashion
that
will
vary
from
case
to
case,
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
it
is.
a
deterrent
effect--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--we're
going
to
assume--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--that
penalties
deter
conduct.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
think
under
that
hypothetical,
if
you
could
make
the
assumption,
i
would
tend
to
agree
that
there's
a
much
stronger
case
for
allowing
a
private
party
to
seek
a
penalty,
because
that
private
party's
going
to
see
a
real
benefit.
that's
not
the
case
here,
but
i
would
agree,
but
to
me
there
is
no
way
that
anyone
could
make
the
statement
that
as
a
general
rule,
penalties
deter.
it
just
is
too...
this
court's
precedents
in
the
linda
r.s.,
the
simon
case,
even
steel
company,
make
that
point
that
when
you--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--well,
i
guess
i
go
back
to
this
decision,
to
the
court's
decision
in
tull,
where
it
pointed
out
that
in
the
congressional
history
of
the
clean
water
act
the
purposes
of
a
penalty,
while
they
include
deterrence,
the
primary
purpose
is
retribution,
punishment,
that
there's
also
a
restitutional
purpose,
whereas
as
i
mentioned,
an
injunction
is
specifically
designed
to
proscribe
or
regulate
future
conduct,
and
that's
what
i
say
when
it's
nonspecific.
the
deterrent
effect
is
there
at
some
level,
but--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--it
may
or
may
not,
your
honor.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
think
congress
can
make
the
judgment.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
justice
breyer,
i
think
congress
can
make
the
judgment,
as
they
do
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
clean
water
act,
that
penalties
will
have
a
number
of
effects,
including
a
general
deterrent
effect.
i
do
not
think
congress
could
make
the
judgment
that
penalties
do
deter
in
every
instance,
because--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--well,
they
give...
under
that
hypothetical,
of
course,
you're
getting
closer
to
penalties
deterring
in
the
great
majority
of
cases.
i
don't
think
congress
can
legislate
article
iii
requirements.
as
far
as,
if
congress
declares
that
penalties
deter,
or
that
they
deter
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
supply,
necessarily,
the
redress
in
article
iii,
and
clearly,
here,
under
these
facts,
when
the
district
court
ruled
in
'97...
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked...
you
brought
out
the
point,
you
can't
sue
in
virginia
to
get
something
in
california.
my
colleague
agreed
with
that.
that's
exactly
what
the
argument
is
in
the
reply
brief,
and
i'm
referring
to
page
7,
where
we're
told,
through
the
affidavit
of
a
paralegal,
that
even
if
we
stop
discharging,
which
we
have,
permanently,
that
laidlaw
and
its
corporate
affiliates
have
other
facilities.
well,
first,
laidlaw
doesn't,
but
our
affiliates
do
in
other
states,
and
there
have
been
recent
violations
of
those,
and--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--yes,
ma'am,
but
i...
but
my
point
was
that
they
have
taken
the
position
that
penalties
imposed
in
south
carolina
will
deter
facilities
in
kentucky
and
texas
that
aren't
really
before
the
court
to
benefit--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--if
they
had
appealed
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief,
i
think
the
court,
the
fourth
circuit
could
have
heard
the...
it
would
not
have
been
moot
for
that
reason,
for
the
statutory
reason--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--yes,
i
think
that's--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--no.
we're
not
suggesting
that
someone,
that
a
plaintiff
who
has
been
denied
injunctive
relief
take
an
appeal,
even
though
the
plaintiff
feels
that
the
injunction
was
properly
denied.
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
we're
saying
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
under
the
clean
water
act
you
must
always
have...
in
order
to
get
penalties,
they
must
be
coupled
with
a
request
for
injunctive
relief.
as
a
matter
of
article
iii--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--yes.
under
the
clean
water
act,
that's
correct,
but
we're
not
suggesting
that
people
take
appeals
in
which
they
don't
have
a
good
faith
belief.
in
this
case--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--they
made
the
decision
not
to
do
it,
and
that's
all
we're
saying,
is
that
once
they
made
the
decision
to
continue
the
litigation
on
appeal,
seeking
only
a
remedy
that
would
not
redress
any
injury
that
they
had,
that
that,
in
effect,
mooted
the
case--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--of
the
steel
company.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--well,
except
if
they
take
up
the
injunction
and
the
civil
penalties,
i
think
steel
company...
justice
kennedy
said
under
the
lyons
case
and
the
casey
case,
and
also
ashcroft
v.
mattis,
you
look
at
each
remedy
individually
and
if
there's
not
article
iii
jurisdiction
for
a
particular
remedy,
it's
not
going
to
save
that
remedy
to
couple
it
with
a
remedy
such
as
an
injunction
that
does
have
an
article...
that
is
grounded
in
article
iii.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
my
position
is
that,
while
congress
has
noted
a
general
deterrent
effect,
which
i
agree
with,
it's
reasonable
to
presume
that
any
penalty
or
sanction
will
have
some
unknown,
general
effect.
traffic
laws
do.
some
people
speed,
some
people--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--it...
the
specific
effect
will
vary
from
person
to
person,
and
that's
our
position,
that
penalties
are
not
specific
enough,
and
you
cannot
predict
the
effect
of
a
penalty
on
a--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--well,
i
think
in
some
cases,
penalties
will
deter.
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
to
make...
to
send
it
back
to
the
federal
courts
for
a
case-by-case
determination.
it's
a
difficult
determination
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
effect
of
a
penalty
is
going--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--my
position
on--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
the
penalties
that
were
imposed
had
no
deterrent
effect,
because
laidlaw
came
into
compliance
on
its
own,
and
was
basically
on
the
verge
of
compliance
before
the
citizens'
suit
was
filed.
i
think
the
penalty
here
were
exactly
because...
what
the
district
court
said,
i'm
mandated
to
do
it,
and
he
based
it
entirely
on
past
violations
and
then
said,
i
believe
this,
with
the
other
costs,
will
deter,
but
it
is
just
too
uncertain
in
any
case,
and
it
creates
a
lot
of
confusion,
and
that's
especially
shown
here,
where
at
one
point
in
the
fourth
circuit
the
petitioners
felt
that
these
were
an
ineffective
deterrent
and
now
feel
that
they're
an
effective
deterrent,
and
i
think--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--that
shows
the
problem.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
there
is.
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
if
you
overrule
the
fourth
circuit,
and
remand
to
the
fourth
circuit
these
other
jurisdictional
questions,
i
think
it
would
be
premature.
if
you...
i
think
the
government
takes
that
position,
too,
that
that
should
be
handled
on
remand.
if
you--
mr.
donald
a.
cockrill
--what
i'm
saying,
justice
ginsburg,
is,
on
remand
to
the
fourth
circuit,
to
consider
the
standing
argument
based
on
lack
of
harm
and
the
statutory
jurisdiction
argument
based
on
the
diligent
prosecution,
subject
matter
defense,
if
you
send
those
back
to
the
fourth
circuit,
then
i
think
it
would
be
premature
for
this
court
to
decide
the
attorney's
fee
issue.
the
fourth
circuit
may
decide
that
there
was
no
initial
jurisdiction,
either
constitutional
or
statutory,
and
that
will
resolve
it.
if
you
affirm
the
fourth
circuit
and
say
they
were
correct,
then
it
might
be
proper
that
the
case
did
become
moot
at
the
time
they
appealed.
then
i
concede
that
it
may
be
proper
to
take
up
the
attorney's
fees
issue
at
that
time.
now,
i
wanted...
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
that
i
have,
i
wanted
to
address
a
question
by
justice
o'connor.
you
asked,
did
the
closure
moot.
i
think
it
clearly
did.
we
did
retain
the
permit.
in
our
rule
21
suggestion
of
mootness
motion
we
have
an
affidavit
that
says
why
we
did
that,
to
make
it
more
attractive
to
a
prospective
purchaser,
kind
of
like
someone
who
sells
a
restaurant
and
keeps
an
abc
license.
it's
easier
to
transfer.
the
more...
perhaps
the
more
difficult
question
is,
if
we
did
moot
it
by
our
unilateral
action,
what
should
happen,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
the
bonner
mall
decision
that
says
the
court
may
make
a
disposition
of
the
whole
case,
as
justice
may
require,
taking
into
account
the
nature
and
character
of
the
conditions
that
led
to
the
mootness.
