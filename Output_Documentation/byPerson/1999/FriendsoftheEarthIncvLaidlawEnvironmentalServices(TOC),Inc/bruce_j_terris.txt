mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
in
this
case,
after
two
trials,
found
that
laidlaw
had
violated
the
clean
water
act
1,412
times.
one
hundred
and
thirty
of
those
times
had
come
in
the
immediate
6
months
before
the
complaint
was
filed,
and
another
36
of
the
violations
came
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
the
complaint
alleged
ongoing
violations
and
it
sought
injunctive
relief.
five
years...
three...
five
years
later,
after
the
complaint
had
been
filed,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
long...
that
laidlaw
was
in
substantial
compliance
and
therefore
there
was
no
need
at
that
point
to
issue
injunctive
relief.
instead,
it
imposed
a
penalty
of
$405,000,
specifically
to
deter
future
violations.
six
years
after
the
suit
was
filed,
the
fourth
circuit
held,
solely
because
injunctive
relief
was
no
longer
in
the
case,
that
the
case
had
to
be
dismissed
as
moot,
and
that
attorney's
fees
would
not
be
payable
to
the
plaintiff.
we
submit
that
article
iii
does
not
compel
such
a
perverse
result.
the
plaintiffs
submit
that,
even
though
the
civil
penalty
is
payable
to
the
united
states
treasury,
that
plaintiffs
benefited
from
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
because
penalties
deter
future
violations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
steel
company
came--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--it
relied
solely
on
steel
company.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
there--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
it
also
involves
what
the
relationship
of
steel
company
is
to
this
court's
prior
decision
in
gwaltney,
because
our
argument
is
that
gwaltney
is
precisely
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
your
honor,
that
gwaltney
did
get
into
the
circumstances.
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
for
this
court
to
over...
to
have
overlooked
the
fact
that
there
was
no
injunctive
relief
in
gwaltney.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
it
discussed
both
standing
and
mootness,
and--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--it
did
not
go
into
the
exact
aspects
of
steel
company,
but
your
honor
found
in
steel
company
itself
that
gwaltney
had...
that
this
court
in
gwaltney
had
upheld
standing,
and
presumably
found
that
that
had
been
a
reasonable
determination.
one
has
to
assume
that
the
court
did
not
simply
overlook
a
matter
as
clear-cut
as
the
fact
that
injunctive
relief
had
never...
had
not
been
issued
in
gwaltney
and
was
no
longer
in
the
case
because
it
had
not
been
appealed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
it
certainly
confused
mootness
with
standing,
because
what
it
did
is
take
a
decision
of
this
court
in
steel
company
and
say
that
it
applied
in
and
of
itself,
with
no
further
reasoning,
to
the
decision,
to
the
case
before
it.
this
court
in
steel
company
said
explicitly
that
the
rules
for
mootness
were
not
the
same
rules
for
standing.
the
government
had
argued
in
steel
company
that
the
law,
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
laid
down
that
for
a
case
to
be
moot
it
must
be
absolutely
clear
that
the
injury
would
not
continue,
that
when
the
solicitor
general
made
that
argument,
that
that
argument
did
not
apply
in
steel
company
because
that
was
a
standing
case,
and
you
could
not
use...
you
could
not
use
that
doctrine
as
a
sword
instead
of
a
shield,
as
this
court
stated.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
true.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
a
substantial
question
about
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--about
that.
what
we
have...
what
your
honors,
of
course,
have
done
is
granted
certiorari
on
a
different
issue.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
what
the
respective
parties
have
presented
to
your
honors
is
their
views
of
the
facts.
those
facts,
of
course,
have
not
been
sifted
through
any
type
of
hearing
in
the
district
court.
part
of
the
facilities
have
been
taken
down,
and
part
of
the
facilities
still
remain.
we
know
that
because
we
had
them
examined
last
week,
and
so
in
addition
the
company
continues
to
have
its
permit.
it
fought,
in
fact,
to
preserve
its
permit
in
state
court
even
after
the
time
that
the...
that
it
had
decided
to
close,
and
it
negotiated
a
closure
agreement
with
the
state
which
allows
it
to
reopen
an
incinerator
in
the
future.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
do
not
think
so,
because
we
think
that
under
walling
v.
james
reuter
and
the
u.s.
bancorp
decisions
of
this
court
that
when
the
voluntary
actions
of
the
defendant
to
in
effect
prevent
a
decision
of
a
district
court
from
being
carried
out,
that
in
the
interests
of
justice
this
court
has
the
power
to
vacate
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
to
therefore
let
the
district
court
decision
continue
to
apply.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--i
don't
think
it
is,
although
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--other
side
debates
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
gwaltney
clearly
holds
that.
there's
no
sense
to
gwaltney,
it
is
absolutely
nonsensical
to
have...
for
this
court
to
have
sent
this
case...
that
case
back
on
remand
if
a
contrary--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--there
are
several...
i
have
several
answers,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
this
is
private
litigation.
this
is
litigation
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
should
be
permissible
to
private
citizens
in
order
to
carry
out
a
function
that
is
essentially
a
governmental
function.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
i
am
saying
that
the
congress
has
said
this
is
not
private
litigation,
this
is
public
litigation
to
carry
out
a
public
responsibility.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
let
me
go
on.
the
states,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
have
not
objected.
one
state
has
objected,
the
state
of
south
carolina.
the
other...
another
group
of
states,
13
of
them,
have
supported
the
plaintiff's
position.
there
is
no
reason
to
see
this
case
as
a...
as
raising
the
fundamental
question
which
is
a
question,
i
submit,
on
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
set
up
this
kind
of
a
mechanism
at
all.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct.
that's
quite
correct,
and
it
wasn't
decided
below,
so
there
is
no
issue
before
this
court
as
to
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
create
a
mechanism
in
which
private
citizens
can
enforce
federal
environmental
laws.
now,
of
course,
there's
a
considerable
history
of
private
citizens
enforcing
laws
which
has
been
held,
upheld
by
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
isn't
the
argument,
your
honor.
our
argument
is
not
that
injunctive
relief
gives
us
the
right
to
sue
for
civil
penalties.
quite
the
opposite.
our
position
is
that
the
congress
has
set
up
a
scheme
in
which
you
can
ask
for
injunctive
relief,
you
can
ask
for
civil
penalties,
and
each
of
those
remedies
has
to
be
analyzed
independently
to
determine
whether
there
was
redressability.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--our
position
is
that
it
is
not
enough
that
congress
has
said
we
have
the
right
to
sue
for
civil
penalties,
any
more
than
it's
enough
to
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
sue
for
injunctive
relief.
we
have
got
to
show
redressability
under
article
iii.
our
position
is
that
civil
penalties,
like
injunctive
relief,
deter
when
there
is
the
possibility
of
future
violations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
do
not
have
to
go
that
far,
your
honor,
because,
of
course,
we
asked
for
injunctive
relief,
as
in
gwaltney.
we...
it
is
important
to
us
that
our
case
is
on
all
fours,
in
fact
a
little
stronger
than
gwaltney,
but
our
base...
but
underneath
that
proposition
is
the
argument
that
civil
penalties
are
sustainable
under
article
iii
if
they
provide
a
benefit
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
our--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--yes,
let
me...
the
district
court
specifically
held
in
this
case
that
the
civil
penalties
did
deter,
and
we
submit
that
that
determination
is
entitled
to
weight.
i
may
say
also
that
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
was
true.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
basically
found
there
was
not
enough
likelihood
of
future
violations
to
justify
injunctive
relief,
because,
of
course...
not
a
mootness
ground.
it
did
not
hold
against
us
on
mootness
grounds
as
far
as
injunctive
relief
is
concerned.
it
held,
as
a
matter
of
using
the
basic
discretion
that
a
district
court
has
as
to
whether
to
issue
injunctive
relief,
not
to
issue
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh...
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
standing,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
there
was
standing,
and
we
proved
standing,
so...
but
that
issue,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
not
before
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
part
of
standing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
certainly
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
you
should
decide
standing,
which
is...
fact-intensive
does
not
raise
an
issue
that's
involved
in
certiorari.
the
closure
issue
i
think
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court,
because
there
was
no
record
whatsoever
on
it.
i
do
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
attorney's
fee
issue
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
it
is
a...
it
has
been
fully
briefed--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--no,
but
there
was
a
decision
by
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--there
was
a
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
will
not
give
attorney's
fees
if
the
case
is
moot,
so
it's
very
likely...
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
on
the
closure
question,
it's
very
possible
that
that
issue
will
continue
to
be
lurking
in
the
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
i
think
there
was.
there
was...
they
were
denied.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
could.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
there
is,
your
honor,
because
no
other
facilities
was
raised
in
the
case
in
the
district
court.
there
was
never
any
discussion
of
that.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
considering
anything
than
the
case
before
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
excuse
me?
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
and
only
this
location.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honors,
in
both
tull
and
romero-barcelo
this
court
said
that
the
clean
water
act's
penalties
were
intended
to
deter,
as...
and
of
course
it
had
other
purposes
as
well.
the
district
court
specifically
found,
and
this
is
on
the
joint
appendix,
on
page
182,
that
the
penalty
that
it
was
imposing,
together
with
attorney's
fees
which
it
contemplated
the
plaintiffs
would
receive,
and
the
attorney's
fees
which
the
defendant's
counsel
obviously
have
received,
would
constitute
deterrence,
so
the...
laidlaw's
argument
before
this
court
that
there
is
not
specific
deterrence
in
this
case
is
in
the
face--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--of
the
determination
by
the
district
court
after
10
days
of
trial.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor...
your
honor
happens
to
have
hit
on
one
of
the
central
grounds
of
our
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was
that
we
take
the
position
that
the
economic
benefit
has
to
be
stripped
from
the
violator
without
taking
into
account
attorney's
fees,
particularly
since
the
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
known
to
the
district
court
at
the
time.
i
think
that
was
a
mistake.
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
here
is,
because
that
issue
is...
clearly
is
not
before
your
honors,
the
point
that
i'm
making
to
your
honors
is
that
the
district
court
clearly
found
that
the
penalty
it
was
imposing
was
a
deterrent
against
future
violations,
that
is,
specific
deterrence,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
a
concrete
benefit
to
the
plaintiffs.
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
question
about
whether...
whether,
if
you
deny
injunctive
relief,
then
you
can't
grant
civil
penalties,
that
injunctive
relief
is
not
a
lesser
form
of
relief,
and
i
think
that
is
very
clearly
shown
in
romero-barcelo.
there,
this
court
said
that
injunctive
relief
should
not
lie
under
the
facts
of
that
case
under
the
clean
water
act,
but
it
then
pointed
out,
although
it
did
not
faithfully
anticipate
this
court's
later
ruling
in
department
of
energy
v.
the
state
of
ohio
about
sovereign
immunity,
but
it
then
pointed
out
that
penalties
were
an
alternative
to
injunctive
relief,
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
there
was...
that
there
was
not
enough
likelihood
of
violations
to
justify
the
extraordinary
relief
of
injunctive
relief.
it
said
that
the
defendant
did
not
need
to
show
no
chance
of
violations
in
order
to
defeat
injunctive
relief
under
the
ordinary
four-part
test
for
injunctions,
but
it
then
quite
clearly
said,
when
it
got
to
civil
penalties,
that
that
was
a
deterrent,
and
it
would
stand
in
place
of
injunctive
relief.
thank
you.
