unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
what
happened,
perhaps,
was
the
district
court
handled
this
at
a
time
before
we'd
handed
down
steel
company.
unknown
speaker
and
the
fourth
circuit
reviewed
it
after
that
case
had
come
down,
and
apparently
placed
some
reliance
on
that,
right?
that
seems
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
that
seems
to
be
what
happened
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
so
it
boils
down
to
what
we
meant
in
steel
company--
unknown
speaker
--as
applied
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
gwaltney
didn't
really
get
into
the
circumstances
expressly,
and
i
guess
steel
co.
did,
so
we
have
to
reconcile
that
in
some
way.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
jurisdictional
point,
and
our
cases
are
replete
with
the
statements
that
actions
by
this
court
on
jurisdictional
matters
that
do
not
discuss
the
jurisdictional
matters
are
not
precedential.
unknown
speaker
and
did
gwaltney
discuss
the
jurisdictional
matter
explicitly?
unknown
speaker
this
aspect
of
standing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
terris,
do
you
think
the
fourth
circuit
may
have
confused
mootness
with
standing?
unknown
speaker
--thing
if
i
may.
the
roebuck
facility
has
been
closed
now,
as
i
understand
it,
and
the
incinerator
removed.
unknown
speaker
does
that
moot
the
case
perhaps?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
terris.
let's
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
a
week
ago
the
case
became
totally
moot,
and
everybody
would
agree
with
it.
would
that
exonerate
your
opponent
from
paying
the
civil
penalty?
unknown
speaker
mr.
terris,
can
i
ask
you,
the
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
it
would
surely
be
okay
to
grant
the
penalty
relief
if
injunction
relief
had
also
been
granted.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
even
think
that's
a
debatable
problem.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
cases
do
you
know
that
have
said
it
is
a
proper
function
of
courts
in
private
litigation
to
impose
a
public
penalty,
that
is,
a
penalty
that
does
not
go
to
the
plaintiff
but
that
goes
into
the
public
treasury?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
major
proposition
to
establish
without
any
discussion
about
it.
i
mean,
every
time
you
alter
from
the
traditional
status
quo
the
functions
of
the
courts
you
alter
also
the
functions
of
the
other
branches
of
government,
and
the
states
are
complaining
here
because
they
think
that
the
decision
whether
to
impose
a
civil
penalty
or
not
belongs
to
the
executive
branch.
it's
part
of
prosecutorial
discretion.
and
by
placing
that
within
the
courts
there
is
a
major
alteration
of
power
between
the
various
branches
of
government
and,
in
this
case,
not
only
between
the
executive
and
the
judicial
at
the
federal
level,
but
also
between
the
federal
and
the
state
governments.
unknown
speaker
but
congress
can't
say
anything.
congress
can't...
just
because
congress
has
said
it,
it
doesn't
mean
the
courts
can
do
it.
there's
a
proper
role
for
courts.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
congress
has
said
it.
the
issue
is
whether
that's
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
raise
that
question
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
this
discussion
began
when
we
asked
whether
or
not
the
pendency
of
an
injunctive
suit
that's
live
allows
you
to
collect
civil
penalties
which
are
retroactive,
and
the
respondent's
brief
quotes
lewis
and
casey
for
the
proposition
that
standing
is
not
dispensed
in
gross.
in
lyons
v.
city
of
los
angeles...
the
chokehold
case
is
the
same...
we
looked
to
each
claim
to
see
if
there's
standing
as
to
each
claim.
unknown
speaker
so
in
light
of
those
cases,
why
is
it
that
you
can
argue,
as
you
do,
as
you
seem
to
do,
that
the
impendancy
of
the
injunctive
action
somehow
confers
standing
to
collect
civil
penalties
for
the
past
wrong?
that
goes
against
the
teaching
of
those
cases,
does
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
say
that
there
is
no
standing
requirement
for
the
civil
penalties.
they
stand
separately.
for
injunction,
you
have
to
show
the
injunction
will
help
you,
but
for
the
civil
penalties,
all
you
have
to
show
is,
congress
gave
you
the
right
to
be
a
private
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
have
to...
do
you
take
the
position,
rather,
that
there
has
to
be
a
reliance
on
continuing
violations
of
the
statute
to
get
the
standing?
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
us
to
analyze
this
case
as
if
you
asked
just
for
civil
penalties.
you'll
rise
and
fall
with
that,
on
this
issue.
it's
just
as
if
you
sued
for
backward
relief,
not
for
future
injunctive
relief.
unknown
speaker
but
they
would
have
to
provide
a
benefit
rather
specifically,
would
they
not?
i
mean,
you
couldn't
sue,
say
in
virginia
and
try
to
get
something
done
out
in
california.
unknown
speaker
finish.
finish
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals--
--did
it
find
that
the
penalties
deterred
conduct
that
had
an
adverse
impact
on
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
find
that
the
civil
penalties
deter
conduct
that
has
an
adverse
impact
on
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
i
want
to
be
clear
on,
the
civil
penalties
clearly
would
deter
future
violations.
the
question
i'm
asking
is,
were
the
violations
established
in
this
case
ones
that
had
an
adverse
impact
on
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
prove
that
the
violations
adversely
affected
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
review
that,
and
one
of
the
questions
that
i
have
is,
assuming
i
would
agree
with
you
that
this
case
is
not
moot,
mustn't
this
court
stop
there
and
say,
whatever
the
district
court
found,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
review
it,
so
we
would
say,
case
not
moot,
court
of
appeals
stop
assuming
standing,
decide
all
these
questions
that
you
didn't
decide.
what
right
would
we
have,
if
we
agree
that
the
case
isn't
moot,
to
decide
anything
but
that?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
even
decided
in--
--but
is
there...
there's
no
final
judgment
there,
is
there,
on
the
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
thought
there
was
no
final
judgment
as
to
the
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say,
as
i
recall,
that
they
would
not
award
attorney's
fees
if
it
was
not
moot.
unknown
speaker
mr.
terris,
could
i
come
back
to
justice
stevens'
question?
i'm
not
clear
whether
the
deterrence
that
the
court
referred
to,
which
would
be
achieved
by
this
penalty,
was
deterrence
against
violating
the
law
at
this
same
facility
and
in
the
same
manner.
i
mean,
this
company
still
had
a
permit.
they
presumably
could
operate
elsewhere.
they
operated
other
facilities.
it
might
have
been
deterrence
from
violations
there
that
the
court
had
in
mind.
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
means
deterrence
from
a
violation
at
this
very
facility?
unknown
speaker
is
the
permit
specific
to
the
facility?
unknown
speaker
so
that
when
they
retain
the
permit,
it
is
for
this
location
only.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
terris.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
consistent
with
its
refusal
to
issue
an
injunction,
because
ordinarily,
if
you
think
there
are
going
to
be
future
activities
that
need
to
be
deterred,
you
probably
would
issue
an
injunction,
wouldn't
you?
it's
only
if
you
feel
the
people
have
really
changed
their
ways
for
good
that
you
turn
down
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
no--
--that
seems
to
me
entirely
backwards.
i
mean,
the
more
radical...
the
more
radical
sanction,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
impose
a
monetary
penalty,
whereas
the
lesser
one
is
simply
say,
you
know,
don't
do
this
bad
thing
again,
and
you're
saying
the...
you're
saying
here
the
court
found
that
the
probability
of
their
doing
it
again
was
small
enough
that
the
court
was
not
even
willing
to
wag
a
finger
at
them,
and
yet
the
court
socks
them
with
a
monetary
penalty
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it
again.
unknown
speaker
i
find
that
an
extraordinary
upside-down
approach
to
that.
unknown
speaker
it
could
have.
it
need
not
have.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course
the
civil
penalty
looks
in
both
directions,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
court
might
have
said,
well,
i'm
going
to
award
the
civil
penalty
here
in
part
because
of
what
we
find
they
have
done,
and
in
part
for
deterrent
purposes.
i
mean,
it
could
have...
it
could
have
had
both
rationales,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
say?
unknown
speaker
so
they
construed
it
solely
as
deterrent
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
penalty
doesn't
do
that.
a
future
penalty
would
do
that.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that
won't
stop
its
future
violations.
what
will
stop
its
future
violations
is
the
fear
that
a
penalty
will
be
imposed
in
the
future,
right?
i
mean,
if
it
had
assurance
that
no
penalty
would
be
imposed
in
the
future,
it
would
keep
on
its
bad
ways,
wouldn't
it,
despite--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
your...
the
other
counsel:
supposing
the
case
became
moot
today,
would
you
still
be
entitled
to
the
money?
unknown
speaker
even
after
the
district
court
has
said
there
should
be
a
penalty.
unknown
speaker
oh--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
asking
you...
say
it
becomes
moot
after
the
district
court
makes
a
finding
that
they
ought
to
pay
$400,000
to
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
dodging
my
question.
i'm
assuming
mootness.
unknown
speaker
assume
it's
moot,
and
everybody
agrees
it
would
be
moot,
except
for
the
fact
there
may
be
a
fight
over
whether
or
not
they
still
have
to
pay
the
money,
would
that
prevent
it
from
being
moot?
unknown
speaker
to
reimpose
the
district
court's
judgment.
unknown
speaker
and
so
then,
you
think
they'd
have
to
pay
the
money.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
was
trying
ask
you.
yes,
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
then
that's...
i'm
sorry.
were
you
going
to--
--no.
and
that
is
also
true
on
the
assumption
that
you
have
pointed
out
we
have
to
make
in
this
case
that
the
penalty
was
purely
forward-looking.
the
penalty
was
purely
prospective
as
a
deterrent.
you
see,
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
the
penalty
had
both
characters,
forward-looking
and
backward-looking,
but
in
this
case,
as
you've
told
us,
the
penalty
is
entirely
forward-looking.
if
it
is
moot,
so
that
beyond
peradventure
there
can
be
no
expectation
of
repetition,
i
don't
understand
why
the
penalty
would
still
be
enforceable.
unknown
speaker
would
the
injunction
stand,
if
they
had
issued
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
they
reinstituted
the
judgment
but
not
the
remedy.
they
didn't
reinstitute
the
injunction.
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
left
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mootness
was
no
bar
to
the
injunction,
is
what
you're
saying.
that
was
the
necessary--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
about
steel
company,
though?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
cockrill,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
ruling
of
the
district
court
is
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
we've
said
that
you
have
to
take
standing
issues
first,
and
there's
a
barrier
to
the
standing
issue.
that
was
steel
co.,
and
there
seems
to
be
a
barrier
to
the
standing
issue,
the
absolute
ruling
that
if
you
go
and
ask
for
a
future...
for
the
penalty,
the
past
penalty
in
order
to
deter
the
future,
can't
do
it,
no
standing,
so
we
have
to
address
that,
don't
we,
despite
13
years,
despite
all
the
things
you
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
treble
damage
plaintiffs
in
antitrust
cases?
what
about
qui
tam
plaintiffs?
what
about
all
the
instances
in
state
law
where
you
have
a
person
called
a
private
attorney
general?
not
perfect
analogies,
but
why
not
good
enough?
unknown
speaker
if
he
gets
$13.50
he
can
put
a
million
into
the
treasury,
but
if
in
fact
what
he
gets
is
some
assurance
that
there
won't
be
pollution
again,
he
can't
put
the
money
in
the
treasury.
unknown
speaker
i
sometimes
exaggerate.
[laughter]
mr.
minear,
it's
not
universally
agreed
that
qui
tam
actions
are
constitutional
anyway,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
this
court
has
never
faced
the
question,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
quit
tam
squared,
you
might
say.
unknown
speaker
we
have
learned
not
to
do
that.
[laughter]
mr.
cockrill,
the
district
court
said
they
were
in
violation,
and
i...
the
reason
i'm
not
giving
an
injunction
is
because
i
think
that
this
penalty
is
enough
of
a
deterrent.
if
the
district
court
was
wrong
about
that,
isn't
the
implication
that
it
would
have
given
the
injunctive
relief
as
the
only
redress
that
this
plaintiff
would
have
standing
to
pursue?
the
district
court
didn't
say,
an
injunction's
out
of
the
question.
it
said,
i
want
to
deter
this
defendant,
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
through
a
monetary
penalty
to
take
away
the
benefit
of
the
violation.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
district
court
suggested
that
the
plaintiff
was
the
galvanizing
factor
and
that
the
defendant
itself
had
tried
to
get
the
state
into
the
act
and,
indeed,
drafted
the
pleadings
for
the
state
court
suit
that
was
filed,
and
that
was
all
a
nice
cozy
deal
between
the
defendant
and
the
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
did
say,
i
am
not
going
to
do
what
the
statute,
if
everything
was
above-board
would
require,
that
is,
not
take
this
case
because
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
going
on
in
the
state
court.
didn't
the
district
court,
in
order
to
continue
in
this
case,
have
to
say
why
it
was
not
crediting
the
state
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
the
district
court
say,
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i'm
not
giving
injunctive
relief,
it's
not
simply
that
i
assigned
a
whopping
penalty,
but
down
the
road
there
will
be
substantial
counsel
fees?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say,
penalties
have
to
have
a
specific
effect,
mr.
cockrill?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
challenge
here
that
the
penalties
here
imposed
would
have
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
because,
what,
the
conduct
had
already
ceased?
unknown
speaker
well,
you--
--i
don't
think
that's...
you
say
the
district
court
thought
that
the
penalties
were
less
than
the
economic
benefit?
that's
not
what
he
said.
he
said
he
was
removing
the
economic
benefit.
unknown
speaker
similarly,
only
by
removing
the
economic
benefit
of
noncompliance
can
a
civil
penalty
ensure
that
a
violator
receive
no
economic
advantage.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
agree
the
economic
benefit
was
1.1,
or
was
that
what
your
opponent
argued?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
didn't
he
also
anticipate
counsel
fees
at
the
time
he
set
the
$400,000?
unknown
speaker
so
he
figured
that
more
money
was
going
to
come
out
of
their
treasury
at
some
point
as
a
result
of
the
totality
of
their
actions.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
the
penalty
was
not
a
deterrent,
and
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
in
fact
a...
and
it
doesn't
follow
from
historical
practice,
either,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
penalty
cannot
be
a
deterrent
unless
it
is
tied
more
specifically
to
specific
action,
because
equity
frequently
depends
upon
the
accrual
of
coercive
penalties.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
use
of
the
penalty
procedure
without
necessarily
tying
it
to
the
economic
value
of
a
particular
practice
is
in
fact
consistent
with
historical
equity
practice,
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
radical
departure
from
what
the
judge
did
here
from
what
equity
courts
have
done
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
this
may
get
to
a
point
that
is
semantic,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer.
i
just
can't
remember
what
the
court
said
well
enough.
as
i...
is
it
fair
to
say,
in...
consistent
with
what
you
just
told
me,
that
the
court
required
the
particular
past
actions
which
it
identified
as
a
condition
of
awarding
the
penalty,
but
at
the
same
time
said,
the
reason
i'm
awarding
the
penalty
is
not
merely,
as
it
were,
based
on
the
excuse
that
they
did
bad
things
that
i've
identified,
but
i'm
awarding
them
for
prospective
purposes
to
see
that
they
don't
do
those
bad
things
again.
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
what
the
court
did?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
mandated
because
he
found
they
had
done
certain
bad
things.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
there
was
an
allegation
of
continuing
violations.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
the
plaintiffs
included
people
who
lived
along
the
river
and
who
swam
in
it
regularly
and
complained
of
the
mercury
discharges,
and
alleges
violations
that
continued
even
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
amends
the
complaint,
it's
going
on.
now,
do
you
say,
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
court
found
all
of
those
things,
it
could
not
award
a
civil
penalty,
at
the
same
time
denying
an
injunction,
as
a
means
of
deterring
continuing
violations?
unknown
speaker
even
if
all
those
things
that
i've
said
are
true.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
you
raise
the
constitutional
issue--
unknown
speaker
--by
way
of
a
defense.
unknown
speaker
now,
did
the
fourth
circuit
rest
on
some
grounds
of
mootness
as
opposed
to
standing?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
need
to
send
it
back
for
a
review
of
standing?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
agree
that,
as
a
general
matter,
penalties
deter
conduct.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
is
the
basis
of
much
of
our
criminal
law
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
let's
assume
that
with
this
violator,
penalties
would
deter
conduct.
unknown
speaker
let's
make
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
that
an
industry
or
business,
that
i'm
concerned
about
this
because
i
may
have
a
penalty.
let's
make
that
assumption.
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
penalty
goes
to
the
government
as
opposed
to
a
private
plaintiff
so
far
as
deterrence
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
cockrill.
you've
referred
to
nonspecific
deterrence.
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
if
one
assumes...
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
a
fair
statement
or
not...
that
there
had
been
periodic
discharges
of
mercury
in
front
of,
say,
one
of
the
plaintiff's
private
property
that
adversely
affected
the
value
of
that
property,
or
their
ability
to
fish
or
swim,
or
something
like
that,
and
if
the
penalty
is
designed
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
what
had
gone
on
before,
why
wouldn't
that
be
sufficiently
specific?
why
are
you
referring
to
nonspecific--
unknown
speaker
--how
could
it
be
more
specific?
if
it
says
don't...
it
is
a
remedy
designed
to
prevent
that
which
was
wrongfully
done
in
the
past
from
being
done
in
the
future,
and
the
thing
that
was
wrongfully
done
in
the
past
is
specifically
shown
by
the
evidence,
and
therefore
wouldn't
the
deterrence
be
equally
specific?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
well,
if
it
may
or
may
not...
if
it
may
or
may
not,
why
can't...
why
isn't
congress
free
to
make
a
judgment
that
as
a
general
matter
there
will
be
cases
in
which
the
fact
that
a
plaintiff
collects
money
for
a
past
injury
helps
to
deter
this
defendant
from
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
future?
can't
congress
make
the
judgment
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
if
congress
can
make
the
judgment,
then
what
is
it
about
article
iii
that
prevents
them
from
saying
that
a
person
who's
had
injury
in
the
past,
and
might
have
injury
in
the
future,
can
bring
a
lawsuit
to
create
in
this
case
that
specific
deterrence?
unknown
speaker
no,
they're
not
saying
every.
what
they're
saying
is,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
which
they
will
specifically
deter,
and
because
we
think
there
are
quite
a
few
cases
like
that,
there
may
be
some,
maybe
your
case,
where
it
wouldn't
be
true,
but
we
think
there
are
quite
a
few,
and
therefore
we
give
standing
to
people
to
use
that
enforcement
mechanism.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
an
end
argument.
they
made
five
or
six
arguments,
and
that
was--
unknown
speaker
--but
mainly
they
said,
we
don't
have
much
of
a
record
on
this
closing,
we
do
have
the
permit
still
alive,
and
there's
nothing
that
this
court
can
decide
on
that.
there's
one
position
that
you
had
about
mootness
that
i
was
not
clear
on,
and
that
was,
you
seem
to
say
it's
their
fault
because
they
didn't
appeal
from
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief.
suppose
they
had,
would
there
then
be
no
mootness
question?
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
saved
the
case
for
mootness,
even
if
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
that,
all
things
considered,
injunctive
relief
was
unnecessary.
unknown
speaker
then
your
rule
is
simply
going
to
turn
this
into
a
kind
of
appellate
pleadings
game.
unknown
speaker
on
your
rule,
the
plaintiff
is
always
going
to
feel
that,
because
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
know
that
in
fact
reliance
on
the
penalties
is
going
to
get
him
nothing,
because
there
won't
be
any
penalty
left,
and
he'll
have
to
appeal
the
denial
of
the
injunction,
or
he'll
get
nothing.
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
rule,
in
order
to
keep
penalties,
any
penalty
awarded
must
be
accompanied
by
a
continuing
request
for
injunction
at
the
appellate
stage.
unknown
speaker
but
i...
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
turns--
unknown
speaker
--that
may
leave
an
interesting
question,
but
it
turns
the
case
into
rather
a
sport,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
nobody's
ever
going
to
make
this
mistake
again,
if
you
win.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
problem
is
that
if
you
admit
that
they
have
standing
to
get
an
injunction,
because
an
injunction
will
stop
repetition--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
you
admit
that
in
the
long
run,
the
mind
run
of
cases,
congress
could
believe
that
in
the
mind
run
of
cases,
collecting
these
kind
of
penalties
will
stop
repetition,
then
you
must
think
that
they
have
standing
and
redressability
to
get
this
kind
of
penalty.
that's
the
article
iii
argument.
that's
why...
that's
the
argument
that
once
you
go
down
the
road
of
saying
an
injunction
is
okay,
even
though
they're
somewhat
strangers,
and
once
you
say
that
this
has
the
same
effect,
in
many
cases,
as
an
injunction
in
terms
of
specific
deterrence,
even
if
not
in
yours...
that's
a
matter
for
other
places
to
decide...
then
you
must
say
that
there
is
standing
here.
oh,
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
that
you
could
waive
the
requirement
of
deterrence
in
a
particular
case.
what
is
your
position
there?
justice
breyer
believes
that
you've
said
that
it's
enough,
as
i
understand
it--
--that
congress--
--that
congress
has
found
in
the
generality
of
cases
that
penalties
will
deter.
right.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
specific
effect.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
your
position,
then,
that
penalties
can
never
do
the
job,
or
that
it's
a
case-by-case
thing,
that
in
some
cases
you
can
show
that
a
penalty
does
have
specific
deterrence,
or
that
since
congress
has
found
that
penalties
are
enough,
that
that
would
be
true
in
all
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
position
on
it,
though?
unknown
speaker
what
is...
do
you
agree
that
there
was
sufficient
deterrence
for
article
iii
purpose
in
this
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cockrill--
unknown
speaker
--can
i
ask
you,
before
you're
finished
with
this
other
issue
about
counsel
fees,
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
the
so-called
catalyst
theory--
unknown
speaker
--which
the
fourth
circuit
rejected.
is
it
appropriate
for
this
court,
whatever
it
does
on
the
mootness
part,
to
resolve
that
circuit
split
on
catalyst
versus
no
catalyst,
that
you've
got
to
get
something
positive
from
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
handling
it
on
remand,
if
you're
a
district
court,
you
already
know
what
your
circuit
court
has
said,
that
is,
no
catalyst
theory,
so
it
would
leave
this--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
cockrill.
mr.
terris,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--could
the
district
court,
mr.
terris,
simply
say
to
defendant,
i
know
you've
hired
a
very
expensive
lawyer
in
this
case,
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
him
a
lot
of
money,
so
we
don't
need
any
more
deterrence
for
your
violation?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
