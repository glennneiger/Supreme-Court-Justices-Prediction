justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
the
hospital
is
normally
not
going
to
be
the
defendant
here.
i
mean,
it's
usually
going
to
be
somebody
who
stole
money
from
the
hospital.
right?
i
mean,
the...
the
hospital
can
acquire
as
much
ill
gotten
gains
as
it
wishes
and
it
wouldn't
be
caught
by
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes.
no,
no.
but
i'm
saying
if
you
say
that
the...
if,
as
the
government
says,
the
hospital
itself
falls
under
this
statute...
never
mind
the
intermediary,
the
hospital
itself...
the
hospital
would
not
normally
be
the
person
who...
who
would
be
prosecuted.
it
would...
the
person
prosecuted
would
be
somebody
stealing
from
the
hospital.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
hospital
by
reason
of
its
stealing
from
somebody
else--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
medicare
recipient
or
anybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
keeping
hospitals
honest
here.
that's...
that's
not
what
the
issue
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could...
you
could
get
an
employee
of
the
intermediary
for
stealing
a
truck.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
the
stealing
a
truck
hypothetical
has
a
lot
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
lot
of
appeal,
but...
but
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
somebody's
theft
of
a
truck
is
going
to
be
covered
by
this.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
were
getting
money
from
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
recollection
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
accountability
in
your
theory?
why?
i
mean,
i
thought
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
the
jail
was
being
reimbursed
for
services
provided
to
the
prisoner
or
not.
and
i
gather
it
wasn't
being
reimbursed
for
any...
any
debt
that
the
prisoner
owed.
i
mean,
it's
remarkable
to
think
that
besides
being
kept
in
jail,
you
owe
money
for
your
keeping.
maybe
they
did
that
once
upon
a
time.
it
would
be
a
good
idea,
but
nobody
thinks
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
horwitz,
do
you
think
that
these
regulations,
5,000
pages
or
however
many
pages...
do
you
think
that
they
prohibit
the...
the
hospital
from
spending
more
on
patient
services
than
the
hospital
will
be
reimbursed?
they
surely
say
we'll
only
reimburse
you
for,
you
know,
these
particular
procedures.
if
the
hospital
is
extravagant
and
in
fact
expends
much
more
money
on
a
particular
procedure,
do
you
think
that
the
government
cares?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't.
so,
the...
the
hospital
can
really
ride
itself
into
bankruptcy
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
argument
is
here
that
the
government
is
terribly
concerned
about
the
hospital
being
defrauded
into
bankruptcy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
respond
to
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
if
that
is
true,
the
local
grocery
store
is
also
a
beneficiary
and
any
theft
from
the
corner
grocery
store
becomes
a
federal...
a
federal
crime
under
this
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
by...
by
reason
of
the
food
stamp
program
i'm
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
the
store
is
reimbursed
for
what
the
store
provides
to
the
customer.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
a
federal
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing
as
happens
here
with
the
hospital.
the
hospital
provides
the
services,
is
reimbursed
by
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's...
but
that's
not
crucial
to
your
case.
i
mean,
if
your
case
is
right,
the
local
grocery
store
is
covered
and
every...
every
stickup
of
a...
of
a
corner
supermarket
is
a...
is
a
federal
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
the
government
was
really
concerned
with...
with
the
financial
stability
of
local
grocery
stores
so
that
it
wanted
to
be
sure
that
nobody
is
embezzling
money
from
local
grocery
stores
because,
after
all,
these
local
grocery
stores
are
in
the
food
stamp
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
they're...
they're
two
different
things.
in...
in
some
situations,
the
money
is
provided
to
the
organization,
and
the
organization
is
told,
go
provide
the
services.
that
is
what
is
done
to
the
intermediaries
under
medicare.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
quite
something
else
to
say
when
you
have
provided
services
to
somebody,
we
will
reimburse
you
after
the
fact
for
those
services
you've
provided.
it
seems
to
me
that's
fundamentally
different
and
that
the
federal
government
doesn't
have
any
concern
about
the
financial
stability
of
that
organization
so
long
as
the
services
have
been
provided
of
a
quality
that
the
government
is...
desires.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
regulations
that
prevent
that
directly
and
immediately.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
have
been
picked
up
under
the
regulations
governing
the
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
the
local
grocery
store
won't
be
able
to
sell
groceries.
i
know
not
a
swallow
falls
from
the
air
that
the
government...
the
federal
government
isn't
concerned
about
it,
but
do
you
really
think
that
this...
this
statute
was
directed
at
assuring
the
solvency
of
the
local
grocery
store
or...
or
the
local
hospital?
what
does
the
government
care
so
long
as
the
services
are
provided
at
the
cost
that
the
government
considers
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
swallow
falling
from
the
air.
i
mean,
you
could
say
the
same
about
the
grocery
store.
god,
don't
start.
the
next
thing
you
know
they'll
be
selling
rotten
beets
and
so
forth.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
fair,
but
has
the
government
established
that
in
this
case?
i
mean,
to
be
sure,
all
that
(b)
says
is
the
circumstance
referred
to...
is
that
the
organization
receives
in
any
1-year
period
benefits
in
excess
of
$10,000.
now,
you're
now
saying
that
indeed
the
hospitals
may
receive
some
other
federal
benefits
in
excess
of
$10,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
only
thing
you
were
relying
upon
was
the
fact
that
it's
reimbursed
for
the
services
that
it
provides
to
medicare
recipients
in
excess
of
$10,000.
wasn't
that
the
only
reliance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
that...
those
are
the
only
funds
you're
relying
upon
is
under
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may
think
it's
met,
but
did
you
establish
that
it
was
met
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
aside
from
medicare
payments.
you're
now
saying
you
take
the
position
that
even
if
medicare
payments
don't
count,
the
hospital
is
still
a
beneficiary
under
some
other
federal
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
establish
that
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
ultimately
when...
when
the
books
are
balanced,
the
only
thing
that
the
hospital
gets
is...
is
reimbursement
for
the
cost
of
services
it
has
provided
to
the...
reasonable
cost
of
services
it
has
provided
to
the
patient.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what...
but
they
gave
the
money
to
the
organization
to
give
it
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
as
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
as
if
in
this
case
there
were
an
entity
that
received
money
and...
and
held
it
until
the
hospital
submitted
a...
a
bill.
and
that
entity,
that
fiscal
intermediary,
it
seems
to
me
might
well
be
covered
by
the
statute
because
it's
holding
funds
in
order
to
disburse
them
to
another
entity
that
then
performs
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
in
this
question,
the
hospital
itself
performed
the
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
isn't
just
whether
there's
reimbursement.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
reimbursement
for
a
debt
that
somebody
else
owes.
that's
the
crucial
distinction
here.
in
those
other
programs,
there
is
no
debt
that
these
people
who
were
provided
these
services
owed
to
the
model
cities
or
anybody
else.
but
here
there
is
a
debt
that
the
person
who
got
the
medical
services
owes
to
the
hospital,
and
all
the
federal
government
is
doing
is
picking
up
that
debt.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
world
of
difference
from...
from
another
benefit
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
advance
of
what?
in
advance
of
the
provision
of
the
services
or
in
advance
of
the
submission
by
the
hospital
of
the
actual
accounting
for
the
services?
do
we
actually
know
that
the...
that
there...
you
know,
that
there's
a
time
lapse?
the
government
gets
the...
the
hospital
gets
the
money
for
it's
actually
provided
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
think
it's
misleading
to
say
it's
paid
in
advance.
it...
it's
paid
in
advance
of...
of
actually
figuring
out
how
much
they...
they
had
expended,
but
i
don't
think
anybody
knows
whether
in
fact
they're
a
little
bit
behind
or
a
little
bit
ahead
at
any
one
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the...
the
dispensers
of
the
job
training
or
whatever
in
those
programs
charge
people
for
the...
for
the
services,
do
you
think
they
would
get
any...
you
know,
any...
any
takers
if
they...
if
they
charged
for
the
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
at
least
it
won't
hit
the
mom
and
pop
grocery
store.
we...
we
can
get
the...
that
gets
the
mom
and
pop
grocery
store
off,
i
mean,
if
it's
not
incorporated.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
argument
that
that's
what's
happening
in
the
model
cities
program?
job
training.
you're
getting
the...
the
company
that
gets
the
money
or
the
organization
that
gets
the
money
is
being
reimbursed
for
the
cost
of
providing
job
training.
