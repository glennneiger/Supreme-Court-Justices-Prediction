justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
has
a
tremendous
interest
in
how
it
spends
the
medicare
money,
and
don't
they
have
like
500,000
pages
of
regulations
on
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
either.
i'm
making
that
up.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
says...
they
may
not,
but
why
isn't
it
enough
to
be
a
beneficiary,
that
the
government's
whole
program
is
aimed
at
getting
money
to
the
hospital
to
reimburse
them
for
these
costs?
i
mean,
obviously,
they...
they
think
that
the
patients
are
beneficiaries
and
they
obviously
also
think
the
hospitals
are
beneficiaries.
don't
they?
i
mean,
why
not?
why
can't
both
be
intended
beneficiaries
of
government
largesse,
one
through
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
not,
but
that's
my
question.
why
not?
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
here
in
any
event...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
medicare
is
about
$200
billion
or
more,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
$300
billion,
and
i
think
isn't
the
federal
government
aware
that
giving
$300
billion
to
hospitals
makes
a
big
difference
as
to
whether
the
hospitals
are
stable
or
not?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
i've
seen
cases
in
which
the
medicare
regs
are...
give
more
money
to
the...
to
the
hospital's
capital
costs
or
you
give
less
money
depending
on
whether
they're
teaching
hospitals,
on
whether
the
hospital
needs
it
because
in
the
absence
of
the
extra
money...
contribution
to
capital,
the
hospital
will
fail
or
would
be
unlikely
to
be
able
to
provide
a
teaching
service
or
certain
other
services,
et
cetera.
it
seems
to
me
i've
seen
arguments
like
that
in
cases.
am
i
misremembering
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
isn't
this
unlike
the
food
stamp
program,
whatever
the
merits
of
the
food
stamp
program
are
or
are
not
vis
a
vis
the
statute?
that
this
statute
foresees
as
one
of
its
objectives
a
funneling
a
lot
of
money
to
hospitals
so
that
they,
in
fact,
can
maintain
the
services
that
they
previously
provided
or
might
think
of
providing,
et
cetera.
or
is
that
an
unfair
characterization?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
can
understand
that.
and
don't
agree
with
me
if
you
think
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
just
seems
to
me
you're
going
on
the
theory,
hey,
kid,
here's
a
quarter,
buy
some
bubble
gum.
all
right?
that's
one
kind
of
program.
but
it
would
be
naive
to
think
this
is
that
kind
of
program.
i
mean,
this
is
thousands
of
pages
of
regulations
that
go
into
negotiated
costs
with
the
hospital,
including
capital
costs
and
everything
under
the
sun.
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
put
down
a
book
of
hhs
regulations
and
you'll
see
it.
and
that
to
me
is
not
a
program
that's
just
like,
hey,
reimburse
the
guy
for
some
bubble
gum
he
gave
the
kid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
this
is
a...
this
is
a
very
complex,
cost
focusing,
negotiated
system
of
what
is
repaid,
what
isn't,
and
how
does
that
affect
the
hospital.
but
don't
agree.
say
i'm
wrong
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
is
federal
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question...
well,
maybe
i'll--
