mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
does
the
payment
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
of
medicare
patients
constitute
receipt
of
benefits
under
a
federal
program
involving
federal
assistance.
i
submit
the
answer
is
no.
under
section
666,
the
federal
statute
that
extends
bribery
and
theft
to
what
would
otherwise
be
local
governments
and
local
organizations,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
here,
i
submit,
would
define
benefits
as
that
entity
or
that
product
that
is
being
administered
or
cared
for
by
a
surrogate
of
the
federal
government,
which
was
why
this
legislation
was
passed.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
equated
benefits
with
payment.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
yes.
subsection
(b),
your
honor,
which
provides
that
an...
subsection
(b)
is
the
jurisdictional
section
for--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--b
as
in
boy,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
subsection
(a)
sets
out
the
prohibited
activity,
basically
theft
in
subpart
(1),
then
bribery
or
soliciting
a
bribe.
subpart
(b)
is
the
jurisdictional
limitation
of
the
statute...
b
as
in
boy...
which
says
that
the
statute
applies
to
organizations
that
receive
benefits
in
excess
of
$10,000
under
a
federal
program
involving
grant,
contract,
insurance,
or
other
form
of
federal
assistance.
so,
that's...
that
subsection
(b)
is
the
jurisdictional
element
which
is...
i
submit
under
the
legislative
history,
was
included
along
with
subsection
(c)
so
as
to
not
extend
this
federal
jurisdiction
into
what
would
and
should
be
otherwise
state
law
enforcement
activity.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the...
the
answer--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
that...
that
the
medicare
system
as
seen
in...
in
the
legislation
and
in
the
code
of
federal
regulation
makes
clear
that
the
providers
are
simply
providing
a
service.
the
benefit
here
is
to
the
patient,
the
medicare
recipient,
in
getting
services,
and--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--your
honor,
in
the
sense
of
benefits
in
the
sense
of
a...
a
verb,
anyone
who
receives
largesse,
any
company
that
receives
a
payment
from
the
government
benefits.
and
benefits
in
the
sense
of
a
noun
in
the
sense
of
what...
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
the
del
toro,
hinton,
and
mosley
cases
and
which
arose
and
why
congress
passed
this
law
before
the
dixson
case
sort
of
reigned
those
in,
those
three
cases
all
involved
the
administration
of
assets
of
the
federal
government
through
a
surrogate.
and
if
we
take
the
contention
of
the
government,
that
is,
assistance
payments
and
those
who
assist...
receive
assistance
payments
is
the
test,
then
i
think
congress
would
have
said
that.
you
know,
they
would
have
said,
anyone
who
receives
assistance
payments...
their
organization
will
be
subject
to
this
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the
benefit...
and
again,
getting
back
to
the
difference
between
a
noun
and
verb,
your
honor,
the...
the
purpose,
as
seen
in
the
legislative
history,
is
to
protect
the
funds
that
surrogates
of
the
federal
government
are
administering.
there's
no...
once
that
hospital
is
paid
for
these
services,
it's
no
longer
accountable
for
how
it
spends
its
money,
nor
does
the
federal
government
have
any
interest
in
how
it
spends
its
money.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
it
might,
but
i
would
submit
that
if
that's
what
congress
wanted,
they
would
have
said
anyone
who
receives
assistance
payments.
if
not--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--i
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor,
a
exception
for
medicaid--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--your
honor,
the
medicare
benefits
are
subject
to
the
protection
as
long
as
they
stay
within
the
program
funds.
for
example,
if
someone
in
the
intermediary
were
to
solicit
a
bribe
for
making
a
cost
determination
that
was
beneficial
to
the
hospital,
that
intermediary
receives
the
benefits
and
disburses
those
benefits
and
helps
disburse
those
benefits
and
is
acting
as
a
surrogate
for
the
government
to
protect
that.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
no.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
the
benefits
here
is
the
resources
that
are
being
utilized
in
the
medicare
system
to
provide
the
beneficiary...
that
is,
the
patient...
with
its
services.
when
the
hospital
is
paid,
that
ends
it.
but
when
the
intermediary
is
administering
those
funds,
then
they
are
still
subject
to
the
protection
of
section
666.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
there
is
a
distinction
between
cost
of
buying
a
service,
at
which
point
the
administration
of
the
federal
funds
ends,
and
the
individual
or
company
at
that
point
or
state,
whoever
supplies
that
service,
then
has
the
funds
to
do
it
as
they
wish.
under
the
definition
of
benefits
equals
federal
assistance,
there's
a
whole
parade
of
horribles
that
can
be
imagined,
even
a...
paying
a
farm
company
not
to
grow
crops.
when
they
receive
those
funds,
it's
over.
the...
the
federal
government
no
longer
has
an
interest
in
administering
those
funds.
under
the
receipt
of
benefits
analysis,
somebody...
an
employee
who
steals
a
tractor
has
now
committed
a
federal
offense
because
the
farm
company
has
received
assistance
in
the
sense
of
it
hasn't
planted
crops.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
if
the
hospital
is
receiving
those
federal
dollars,
for
example,
under
a
program
where
it
is
administering
rather
than
just
getting
paid--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
would
say
that
when
the
hospital
is
paid
for
the
service,
that...
the
coverage
of
666
is
ended.
the...
the
government,
as
it...
as
it
mentioned
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
recognized
that
there
are
many
other
statutes
passed
that
specifically
protect
the
medicare
system.
so,
there's
not
a
necessity
to
protect...
to...
to
interject
the
federal
government
under
666
into
how
the
hospital
spends
its
money
after
it
is
paid
for
its
service
when
the
government
has
no
interest
in
how
it
spends
its
money.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
your
honor,
if
the
hospital
were
to
bribe
the
intermediary,
it
would
be
covered.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
it--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--it
is
the
question
of
how
far
does
the
jurisdictional
element
go.
how
far
does
the
federal
government
go
into
what
should
and
has
traditionally
been
state
law
enforcement.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the
issue
is
how
far
does
the
jurisdiction
travel.
does...
does
it
go
to
all
employees
of
a
hospital
simply
because
the
hospital
is
paid
for
providing
a
service?
does
it
go
to
the
driver
who
delivers
food
in
the
hospital
truck
or
picks
it
up
if
he
decides
to
steal
the
truck?
are
we
going
to
put
that
into
federal
court
as
a
crime?
and...
and
the
legislative
history,
i
would
submit,
read
fairly,
would
indicate
that
congress
was
not
intent
in
covering
those
commercial
transactions,
and
that's
why
subsection
(b)--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--unfortunately,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
if...
if--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--if
the...
if
the
intermediary
has
a
car
and
an
employee
steals
that
car,
it's
covered,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
this
is
reimbursement
of
expenses,
your
honor,
which
is
also
covered
in
subsection
(c).
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--sorry.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
well,
your
honor,
the...
the
reason
why
i
think
it's
helpful
is
this.
the...
this
statute
was
passed
before
the
court
came
down
with
its
decision
in
dixson
to
attempt
to
alleviate
the
perceived
problem
in
del
toro,
hinton,
and
mosley,
which
was
bribery
of
a...
by
an...
a
local
agency
administering
funds.
section
201
was
the
statute
that
was
attempted
to
be
applied
in
that
setting,
and
if
one
looks
at
section
201,
there
is
no
equivalent
of
subsection
(c)
in
section
201.
you
don't
need
subsection
(c)
to...
to
modify
the
prohibited
activity.
you
never
have
a
good
faith,
corrupt
bribe.
you
never
have
a
good
faith,
corrupt
solicitation
of
a
bribe,
and
you
never
have
a
good
faith
theft.
you
may,
however,
have
a...
as...
in
the
congressional
record
cited
in
the
briefs
where
they
say
congress
said
it
wasn't...
the
senate
report...
excuse
me...
said
it's
not
intended
to
cover
the
purchase
of,
say,
a
copy
machine.
so,
if
you...
if
you
have
a
good
faith
purchase
of
a
copy
machine
for
$10,000,
you're
not
going
to
subject
all
the
employees
of
that
company
to
federal
jurisdiction,
but
if
it's
not
a
good
faith
purchase
of
a
copy
machine
and
therefore
it
is
a
type
of
theft
or
bribe,
then
it
would
cover
it.
so,
i
think
that
subsection
(c)...
it's
interesting
that
it
is
not
in
section
201.
there
is
something
somewhat
similar
to
other
provisions
of
section
201,
but
there
is
no
subsection
(c)
there.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
it
is
cited
in
the
salinas
case,
your
honor,
which
talks
about...
which
is
the
only
other
case
discussed...
discussing
this
section
666
in
the
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
i
don't
have
it
very
handy,
your
honor,
but
it
is
cited
in
the
salinas
case.
and
the
dixson
case
was
the
case
that
really
was
the
appeal
of...
the
appeal
of
the
hinton
case
to
the
supreme
court
is...
is
one
and
the
same
as
dixson.
and
so,
the--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--well--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--well,
your
honor,
it...
it
could
if...
depending
on
how
benefit
is
described
in
subpart
(a).
that
is
described
as
corruptly
benefit,
and
corruptly
has
been
determined
to
have
a
significant
meaning.
any
bribe
or
solicitation
is
modified
by
the
term
corruptly,
which
i
would
submit
does
away
with
the
necessity
of
subpart
(c).
and
what
we...
there's
another
part
that
i
want
to
bring
the
court's
attention
here,
and
that
is
the
medicare
system,
when
this
statute
was
passed,
comes
into
a
series
of...
of...
the
legislation
itself,
which
clearly
talks
about
hospitals
being
providers,
who
are
being
recompensed
for
the
costs
of
the
services,
where
the
beneficiaries
are
the
patients.
the
c.f.r.,
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
also
talks
about
that.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
not
necessary.
i
think
(c)
is
just
a
further
indication
of
the
congressional
intent
and
this...
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
itself.
but
benefits,
in
the
sense
of
a
noun
rather
than
a
verb,
that
is,
to...
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
have
an
interest
in...
in
vindicating
through
its
criminal
laws
those
surrogates
who
are
administering
the
benefits,
this
package
of
federal
benefits,
until
it
gets
to
the
end
of
the
road
and
is
distributed,
at
which
point
the
federal
government
has
no
further
interest
in
it.
and
in
this
case,
there...
there
was
no
further
interest
in
what
and
how
a
hospital
spends
its
money
because
the
auditing
procedures,
as
set
forth
on
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
make
it
clear
that
costs...
only
those
costs
in
relation
to
patient
care
are
allowable.
and
if
there's
a
false
attempt
by
a
hospital
to
be
reimbursed
for
an
investment
loss
or
a
bad
investment,
that
can
be
vindicated
through
a
false
cost
report
or
false
statements
to
the
government
under
the
various
statutes.
so,
the...
the
issue
here
that...
that
seems
to
be
looming
is,
under
the
eleventh
circuit
interpretation,
how...
how
far
is
the
end.
and
there
is
no
end
if
we
take
benefits
and
define
them
as
receiving
federal
assistance
because
then--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--well,
your
honor,
salinas
specifically
did
not
address
the
issue
of
what
constitutes
benefits
under
666.
so,
salinas
talked
about
whether
the
bribe
had
to
directly
affect
the
federal
funds.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the
answer
is
no.
that's
not...
we're
here
to
determine
whether
the
entity
itself
is
receiving
benefits
so
as
to
subject
its
employees
to
bribes.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
from
reading
the
case,
your
honor,
i
can't
give
you
a
specific
answer,
but
it
would
appear
that
the...
the
benefits
are
to
the
federal
government
in
a
continuing
basis
to
care
for
its
prisoners.
so,
in
that
sense
it
still
has
an
interest
in
the
administration
of
those
funds
and
the
administration
of
the
program
to
which
it
is
giving,
i.e.,
the
sheriff's
jail
facility.
so,
there
is--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--yes,
they
are.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
i
wasn't...
your
honor,
i
wasn't
intending
to
zero
in
on
the
money,
but
rather
whether
the
money
that
was
received
was
received
with
the
understanding
that
the
jail
had
to
administer
it
under
a
continuing
program
and
be
accountable
to
the
government
as
to
how
it
dealt
with
the
government's
prisoners.
so,
therefore,
the
benefit
is...
was
not--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the...
the
payment
is
by
the
marshal's
service,
as
i
understand
it,
in
salinas
to
the
county
or
to
the
sheriff
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
the
marshal
in
keeping
prisoners
in
the
local
facility.
and...
and
so,
the
payment
there...
the
benefit
is
to
the
continued
operation
of
the
jail
under
the
parameters
that
the
marshal
seems
appropriate.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
right,
and...
and
the
record,
from
what
i
could
read
of
the
case,
doesn't
seem
to
answer
the
question
of
what
other
provisions
might
be
involved
in
the
marshal's
office
in
determining
whether
there
was
some
obligation
by
the
jail
to
satisfy
the
marshal
in
the
way
these
funds
were
administered,
rather
than
simply
i'm
going
to
pay
you
so
much
a
day
to
keep
a
prisoner
and
we
don't
care
how
you
do
it.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
yes,
your
honor,
with...
i
assume
that
your...
your
question
also
has
within
it
the
presumption
that
the
marshal
has
no
interest
in
how
the
jail
spends
the
money
and
how
it
takes
care
of
the
prisoners
because
then
i
think
it
starts
to
move
it
into
more
of
a
program
being
administered
by
the
jail.
you
know,
if
marshal
wanted,
they
could
build
their
own
jail
and...
and
take
care
and
control
of
the
prisoners.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
no,
not...
not
how
they
should
be
cared
for.
if
they
have
certain
standards
on
how
the
hospital
is
to
administer
the
money
that
it
is
given,
if
the
hospital
has
an
obligation
to
the
government
to
spend
or
not
spend
its
money
under
the
government's
programs
so
that
it
has
continued
to...
to
care
for
the
government's
funds
in
its
continuing
effort
under
the
program.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the
hospital
has
to
be
certified
by
the
federal
government,
but
that
doesn't...
that's
not
the...
in
question.
it
has
to
be
certified
and
it
has
to
have
at
least
a
decent
enough
reputation
in
the
community
that
patients
want
to
go
to
it.
if
no
patients
go
to
it,
you
don't
get
paid.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the...
no.
the
government
is
interested
in
the
ultimate
cost,
and
they
protect
that
interest
through
the
cost
analysis
that
goes
on
in
a
routine,
continuing
basis
to
determine
what
is
the
price
that's
paid.
and...
however,
the
government
does
not
have
an
interest
in
how
the
hospital
spends
its
money.
the
hospital
might
go
out
and
in
this
case
lose
its
money
on
a
bad
loan,
a
fraudulent
loan.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the...
the
government
has
5...
i
don't
know
the
number,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
but...
but
the
government
has
an
interest
in
how
the
money
is
spent
only
to
the
extent
that,
under
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
it
will
reimburse
only
those
reasonable
costs
related
to
health
care
and
providing
health
care
to
the
beneficiaries.
the
government
does
not
have
an
interest
in
other
non
health
care
related
assets.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the...
the
answer
to
that
again
gets
back
to
whether
they
are
a
beneficiary
in
the
sense
of
a
noun
or
a
verb.
does
the
hospital
receive
a
benefit
from
dealing
with...
with
medicare
patients?
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
yes,
they
do.
but
is
that
the
kind
of
benefit
that
was
a
problem
in
del,
hinton,
mosley
and--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--my
point
exactly,
your
honor.
they
don't
care.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
a
hospital--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--i
don't
think
the
hospital...
the
government
is
any
more
concerned
about
what
happens
with
the
hospital's
money,
whether
it
is
in
the
form
of
defrauding
it,
spending
it
wisely
or
unwisely.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
that's...
that's
the
difference
that
i
see.
and,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
goes
back
to
your
answer.
they
are
not...
the
government
has
no
interest
in
whether
the
hospital
is
properly
making
investment
decisions.
it
has
an
interest
in
whether
those
costs...
only
costs
that
are
related
to
the
care
and
treatment
of
medicare
patients
is
included
in
those
costs
to
the
government,
and
the
false
statement
and
medicare
cost
provisions
ensure
to
protect
that.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
and--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--there...
there's
no
interest
in...
if
there
was,
i
would
submit
that
the
rules
and
regulations
would
be
different.
many
times
the
hospital
is
owed
money
at
the
end
of
the
time
period.
it's...
it
is
a
cost...
reimbursement
for
costs.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
the
point
is
the
hospital
is
reimbursed
for
a
cost
of
providing
services.
whether
it's
paid
in
advance
or
after
is
determined
later
when
they
do
a...
an
audit
for
that
period.
so,
the...
the
government
still
does
not
have
an
interest
in
how
the...
how
the
hospital
spends
its
money,
whether
it
does
so
wisely
or
not,
for
to
do
that
would
put
the
federal
government
into
a
situation
that
congress
did
not
envision
because
it
could
have
simply
said
something
else
like
we're
going
to
watch
how
you
get
all
your
federal
assistance.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
it
would
apply
to
blue
cross
and,
your
honor,
it
would
apply--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--the
hospital...
i
think
the
key--
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
--i'll
try
to
answer
this
briefly
with
the
government's
contention
here...
and
it
was
stated,
even
in
the
argument...
is
simply
this
is
still
federal
money.
they
want
to
say
this
is
still
federal
money.
this
is
a
grant.
in
all
those
thousands
of
pages
of
c.f.r.'s
they
never
once
talk
about
this
money
as
a
grant.
it's
a
payment
for
services
to
the
provider.
and
whether
the
provider
is
paid
1
day
in
advance
or
1
day
behind,
it's
still
payment
for
services.
it's
not
federal
money.
all
of
the...
mosley,
hinton,
del
toro
cases
all
talk
about
administering
federal
funds.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
that
may
very
well
be,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that's...
it's...
in
any
event,
the
c.f.r.
makes
clear
that
what
the
hospital
is
getting
is
cost
reimbursement
and
they
may
have
to
adjust
that
cost
later.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
because
the
question
still
is,
is
that
all
that
is
involved?
the
government
wants
to
equate
this
with
a
grant,
and
a
grant
indicates
there's
some
providing
of
ultimate
service.
if
a...
if
a
local
entity
is
given
money
to
administer
a
service
and,
say,
that's
hand
out
methadone
treatment,
the
service...
the
benefit
has
still
not
been
handed
out.
the
government
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
that
person
doesn't...
isn't
bribed
to
hand
out
a
methadone
pill
to
somebody
who
doesn't
deserve
it.
that's
different
from
simply
paying
for
the
service.
and,
yes,
medicare
is
complicated.
there
are
thousands
of
pages
of
regulations,
but
not
one
time
does
the
regulations
say
this
is
a
grant,
this
is
a
gift,
this
is
anything
other
than
we're
going
to
pay
you
for
services.
we
may
have
to
fight
with
you
about
what
the
cost
of
those
services
are.
but
it
is
clearly
not
federal
money,
and
the
government
wants
to
treat
it
as
federal
money.
mr.
mark
l.
horwitz
your
honor,
if
it
is--
