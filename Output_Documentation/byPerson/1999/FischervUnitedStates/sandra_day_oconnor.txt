well,
but
in
a
way
the
benefit
goes
to
the
provider
as
well
because
we're
dealing
here
with
medicare
services
by
a
hospital
when
they
weren't
getting
paid
anything
for
people
who
couldn't
afford
to
pay.
so,
medicare
was
enacted,
and
now
all
of
a
sudden,
a
hospital
can
get
paid
for
doing
something
that
it
was
getting
saddled
with
without
pay
before.
and
in
a
sense,
the
hospital
benefits.
