justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
talking
about
subsection
(c).
it
seems
to
me
that
that
doesn't
altogether
help
you
because
the
terms
are...
the
section
doesn't
apply
to
salary,
wages,
fees,
or
other
compensation
paid.
and
i
take
it
you
claim
that
this
is
other
compensation
paid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
reimbursement
of
expenses.
if
a
hospital
sends
me
a
bill
for
its
x
ray
and
i
pay
it,
i'm
not
reimbursing
its
expenses
and...
and...
nor
am
i
paying
compensation
in
the
usual
sense
of...
of
a
salary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
not
sure
(c)
helps...
is
completely
helpful
to
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
at
least
it
could
be
argued
that
(c)
is
rather
narrow.
it
talks
about
compensation
in
the
sense
of
a
salary
and
not
a
contract
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
very
fact
that
it's
there
indicates
that
if
it
weren't
there,
benefit
could
otherwise
be
interpreted
as
including
compensation,
which
is
not
helpful
to
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
do...
do
we
have
to
interpret
(c)
in
order
to
rule
in
your
favor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
as...
as
i
recall
salinas,
there
was
a
payment
per
day
for
each
prisoner,
but
there
was
also
a
grant
to
improve
the
jail
generally.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
had
the
salinas
question
before
us
and
if
the
only
thing
the
feds...
the
federal
government
paid
were
a
per
day
reimbursement
for
each
federal
prisoner
housed
in
the
facility,
then
it
might
be
like
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
federal
government
had
certain
standards
for
how
patients
should
be
cared
for
in
the
hospitals,
that
would
change
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
hospital
in
your
case
have
to
be
certified
by
the
federal
government
to
receive
these
monies
as
meeting
certain
standards?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
the
government
is
interested
in
how
it
spends
its
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
get
grants,
but...
but
the
federal
government
is
not...
is
not
paying
a
debt
that
somebody
else
owes
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--doesn't
the
word
corruptly
already
handle
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
fact
that
they
were
right
at
the
same
time
makes
it
worse
rather
than
better.
corruptly
would
have
done
the
job.
it
suggests
that
(c)...
(c)
means
something
else.
how
can
you
possibly
corruptly
solicit
or
demand
anything
of
value
which
would
not
automatically
come
within
(c)?
does
not
apply
to
bona
fide
salary,
wages--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
horwitz,
i...
i
assume
that
if
blue
cross
got
this
money
or
some
fiscal
intermediary
and
was
holding
it
and
then
paid
the
hospital,
if
it
was
just
holding
funds,
that
the
statute
would
apply
to
blue
cross.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
why
doesn't
it
apply
to
your
hospital
if
your
hospital
received
funds
in
advance
and
simply
has
to
wait
in
order
to
draw
down
on
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
wait...
or
has
to
wait
in
order
to
make
a
legitimate
claim
to
them
even
though
it
can
draw
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner
was
the
president
and
a
part-owner
of
a
corporation
which
provided
auditing
services
to
health
care
organizations.
he
was
convicted
under
the
federal
criminal
bribery
statute
for
defrauding
a
municipal
hospital
authority
in
a
$1.2
million
loan
and
for
paying
a
$10,000
kickback
to
the
hospital
authority’s
chief
financial
officer.
the
hospitals
participated
in
the
medicare
program
and
during
the
relevant
time
they
received
over
$10
million
in
medicare
funds.
the
question
is
whether
those
funds
constitute
benefits,
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
bribery
statute.
now,
we
conclude
that
they
do,
and
we
affirm
the
petitioner’s
convictions.
the
statute's
substantive
provisions
apply
only
if
the
defrauded
organization
and
this
is
quoting
from
the
statute,
“received
in
any
one
period
benefits
in
excess
of
$10,000
under
a
federal
program”
the
statute
then
goes
on,
but
this
is
the
relevant
part.
both
parties
agreed
medicare
as
a
federal
insurance
program
and
that
the
defrauded
hospital
received
over
$10,000
in
medicare
funds.
so,
the
dispute,
as
i
have
said,
is
whether
the
medicare
payments
are
benefits,
a
term
that
is
undefined
in
the
statute.
the
structure
operation
and
purpose
of
the
medicare
program
provide
essential
instruction
in
resolving
the
statutory
question.
as
the
opinion
explains
in
some
detail,
medicare
payments
are
made
for
significant
reasons
in
addition
to
reimbursing
a
hospital
for
its
costs.
the
government
does
not
make
the
payment
unless
the
hospital
complies
with
an
intricate
regulatory
scheme,
one
which
ensures
provider
posses
the
capacity
to
render
ongoing
care
to
qualifying
patients.
the
medicare
program
accomplishes
this
objective
through
an
elaborate
funding
structure.
the
medicare
program
structure
refutes
the
petitioner’s
assertion
that
the
medicare
program
provides
benefits
only
to
qualifying
patients.
because
the
medicare
program
operates
with
a
purpose
and
design
above
and
beyond
point-of-sale
patient
care,
we
hold,
the
funds
hospital
receives
under
the
program
constitute
benefits
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
bribery
statutes.
we
do
not
suggest
federal
funds
disbursed
under
an
assistance
program
will,
in
all
instances,
result
in
coverage
of
a
recipient
fraud
under
the
statute.
such
a
broad
construction
of
the
term
benefits
would
turn
almost
every
act
of
fraud
or
bribery
into
a
federal
offense,
upsetting
a
federal
balance.
the
conrolling
inquiry
should
examine
the
assistance
program
structure
and
operation
and
the
conditions
under
which
the
defrauded
organizations
received
the
federal
payments.
the
answer
could
depend,
as
it
does
in
this
case,
on
whether
the
recipient’s
own
operations
are
one
of
the
reasons
for
maintaining
the
program.
health
care
organizations
participating
in
the
medicare
program
satisfy
the
standard.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justice
scalia
joins.
