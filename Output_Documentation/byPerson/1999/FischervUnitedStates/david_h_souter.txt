justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
difficulty
of
your
position,
just
based
on
what
you've
just
quoted,
the
statute
refers
to
the
government
as
getting
the
benefits?
so,
i
suppose
it
follows
from
what
you're
saying
that
the
statute
would
never
have
any
application
to
a
medicare
or
medicaid...
a
government
that
gives
money
to
a
medicare
or
medicaid
provider
in...
under
its
contract
obligations.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
does
seem
to
be
what
it...
it
says
when
it...
when
it
refers
to...
under
subsection
(b),
when
it
refers
to
benefits
under
a
program
involving
a
grant,
contract,
subsidy,
and
so
on.
it
sounds...
i
mean,
the
immediate...
most
immediate
reading
of
that
language
says,
oh,
whatever
the...
whatever
the
organization
gets
under
the
grant,
program,
subsidy,
and
so
on,
is...
is
what
the
statute
is
referring
to
as
a
benefit
because
that's
the
only
kind
of
benefit
that...
that
organizations
get.
that
seems
to
be
the...
the
natural
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
isn't
with
respect
to
a
given
item
of
charge,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
government's
concern
is...
is
somehow
over
because
the
government
may
have
a...
a
broader,
systemic
concern
even
though
a
particular
item
of
charge
has
already
been
paid,
and
in
that
respect,
it's
no
longer
the
government's
business.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
congress
could
have...
could
have
said
that.
but
there's...
there's
one
other
thing
that...
that
bothers
me
about
your
position,
and
that
is,
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
except
medicare
and
medicaid
from
the...
from
the
protections
that
this...
for
the...
for
the
public
fisc
and
the
public
welfare
that
this
statute
is
obviously
aimed
at?
why
would
it
have
a
medicare
and
medicaid
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
is.
you've
admitted
that
there
is
on
your
analysis
because
on
your
analysis
the
benefit...
the
person
benefitted,
the
one
who
gets
the
benefit,
is
always
the
patient
at
the
end
of
the...
at
the
end
of
the
line.
and
so,
it
does
seem
to
read
the
statute
out
of
the...
out
of
the
medicare/medicaid--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so...
so,
benefit
would
include
ill
gotten
gain.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
there
is
a
distinction
between
benefit
and
funds
from
which
benefits
ultimately
will
be
paid,
and
that's
what
you
rely
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
government
at...
at
least
is...
is
interested
to
the
extent
of
making
sure
that
it
gets
what
it
pays
for
with...
with
its
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
my
point...
my
point
is,
as
i
understand
from
the
briefs
the
reimbursement
scheme,
the
reimbursement
scheme
is
that
the
government,
in
fact,
makes
quarterly
payments,
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
settle
up.
so,
in
point
of
fact,
some
of
what
the
government
is
paying
for
in
any
quarter
may
not
necessarily
have...
have
yet
been
earned
by
the
hospital.
and
i
suppose
the
government
at
least
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
hospital
remains
solvent
and
functioning
long
enough
to...
to
use
up
the
money
properly
that
it
has
been
paid.
so,
i
suppose
the
government
does
have
a
continuing
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sometimes
it
goes
one
way,
and
sometimes
it
goes
another.
