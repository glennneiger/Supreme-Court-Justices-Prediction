you

--do

from

apply
to
a
third
person
that
just
comes
in
and
sticks
up
someone
at
the
cash
register
in
the
grocery
store
hypothesis?
chief
justice
william

you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
hospitals
are
paid
in

how
do
we
know
that?

but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
justice
scalia
just
said
is
your
present
position
now,
that
sometimes
they
could
be
behind
and
sometimes
they
could
be
ahead?
it's
a--
chief

--bimonthly
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.

if
we
take--

don't
challenge
that,
mr.

statement
that
sometimes
it
may
be
a
little
bit
ahead,
sometimes
it
may
be
a
little
bit
behind
so
far
as
the
actual
accounting
is
concerned?
