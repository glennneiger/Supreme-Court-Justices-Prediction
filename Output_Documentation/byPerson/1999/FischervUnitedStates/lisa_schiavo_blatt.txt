ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
medicare
payments
to
hospitals
are
covered
by
section
666
because
hospitals
directly
receive
federal
benefit
funds
under
an
assistance
program.
the
text
of
section
666(b)
applies
to
recipients
of
benefits
under
a
federal
program
involving
federal
assistance.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the...
the
question
of
whether
the
grocery--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
and
the
question
would
be
whether
section
666
would
apply
to
the
grocery
store
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
receives
the
coupons.
the
coupons
actually
go
to
the
customer
who
would
then
turn
it
in
to
the
store.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
and
our
position--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--our
position
is
that
the
grocery
store,
who
is
approved
for
participating
in
the
food
stamp
program,
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
however,
justice
scalia,
there's
distinctive
features
about
the
medicare
program.
all
money
flows
directly
to
the
hospital.
no
money
goes
to
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
that's
not
correct.
the
theft
applies
to
only
agents.
so,
if
there
is
an
employee
who's
stealing
$5,000--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--from
the
grocery
store,
that
employee
could
also
be
stealing
the
food
stamp
program
or
could
be
receiving
bribes
in
connection
with
the
program,
and
the
government
would
have
an
interest
in
the
integrity
of
those
officials
at
the
store.
but
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
it
applies...
what...
what
section
666
does
is
protect
the
integrity
of
program
funds
by
assuring
the
integrity
of
the
agents
of
the
organization
that
received
them,
and
the
types
of
officials
who
could
be
either
on
the
take
or
involved
in
transactions
over
$5,000
could
mishandle
federal
money.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
prototypical
financial
assistance
program
congress
had
in
mind
is
no
different
than
the
medicare
program,
in
which
what
the
government
does
is
give
benefit
monies
to...
to
organizations
who
turn
around
and
use
that
money
to
provide
services
or
other
assistance
to
beneficiaries.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
there
are
two
responses
to
that,
justice
scalia.
medicare
does
not
work
differently
than
a
lot
of
programs
in
which
what
the
government
does
is
either
reimburse
or
compensate
an
entity
for
providing
services.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and...
but
they're
still
financial
assistance
programs
and
the
government
does
have
an
interest
in
the
integrity
of
those
funds.
if
a
hospital
is
either
filled
with
corrupt
officials,
two
things
can
be
happening.
the
first
is
that
the
hospital
is
less
likely
to
provide
care...
quality
patient
care
to
medicare
beneficiaries,
and
that
directly
hurts
the
program.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the...
well,
the
regulations
or
criminal
statutes
deal
with
fraud
in
connection
with
the
program.
they
don't
act
prophylactically
to
protect
the
institution
from
having
corrupt
officials.
the
other
thing
that
this
does
is
the
official
that
was
bribed
in
this
case
was
the
chief
financial
officer.
he
just
as
well
could
have
been
taking
bribes
to
refer
patients
to
unnecessary
medical
services
or
to
purchase
unnecessary
medical
supplies
or
to
undergo
unnecessary
procedures.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
it
would
have...
yes.
but
this
official
in
this
case
was
taking
a
bribe
in
connection,
was
just
taking
the
hospital's
money
and
making
a
bogus
loan.
and
that
threatened
this
institution's
capacity
to
service
medicare
beneficiaries,
and
that
hurts
the
medicare
program--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--because
this
is
an
assistance
program
in
which
the
whole
point
of
which
was
to
provide
federally
funded
services
to
needy
individuals
who
qualified
under
the
program.
and
if
the
hospital
has
corrupt
officials,
something
is
going
to
give
with
respect
to
the
hospital.
either
the
hospital
is
going
to
cut
its
staff
or
its
going
to
stop
providing...
performing
certain
procedures,
and
that
hurts
the
program.
this
was
a
lot
of
money--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
this
case
involves
a...
a
medicare
program
and
the
medicare
program
depends
upon
the
solvency
of
hospitals
and
the...
and
the
integrity
of
the
officials
who
work
there.
again,
this
was
a...
a
relatively
small
hospital
serving
a
rural
area
where
a
lot
of
people
were
medicare
beneficiaries
in
the
community,
and
the
government
saw
an
interest
in
this
case
in
prosecuting
the...
the
petitioner
who
bribed
the
chief
financial
officer
of
the
hospital
for
making
a
million
dollar
loan.
we
also--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it's
$300
billion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
i
mean,
there's...
there's
no
question
that
the
medicare
act
has
a
lot
of
features
which
subsidize
the
hospital
to
make
sure
it
can
survive.
most
hospitals
are
dependent
on
medicare
to
assure
their
financial
survival.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
i
think
that's
fair.
hospitals
are
dependent
on
the
medicare
program
and
the
medicare
program
is
dependent
on
hospitals.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
our
position--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
our
position
is
that
the
medicare
funds
that
are
paid
to
hospitals
are
indisputably
federal
benefit
funds
that
are
received
by
the
hospital.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
to
the
extent
that
there's
some
requirement
that
the
hospitals
be
considered
in
and
of
themselves
aided,
we
think
that
criteria
is
met.
but
we
don't
think
the
statute
requires
it.
it
doesn't
require
that
the
recipient
be
an
administrator.
that
word
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
oh,
yes.
we
established
that
$10
to
$15
million
in
medicare
payments
went
to
this
hospital.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
the
only--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
i
think
you're
correct.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
that
the...
the
finance
officer
said
that
most
health
organizations
are
dependent
on
funds
that
come
from
the
federal
government.
but
our
primary
position
is...
was
that
under
the
plain
language
of
this
statute,
the
term
benefit
is
talking
about
either
benefit
money
or
other
things
of
value
that...
that
are
provided
under
a
federal
program
involving
federal
assistance.
medicare
is
a...
is
a
quintessential
federal
assistance
program
that
provides
the
benefit
funds
to
the
hospitals
that
turn
around
and
use
this
money
to
provide
federally
funded
medical
services.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
we
would
take
the
position
that
a
grocery
store
that
participates
in
the
food
stamp
program
receives
the
money.
however,
justice
ginsburg,
it
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
would
extend
to
earmarked
funds
that
go
to
the
recipient
only
through
an
indirect
relationship.
that
question
is
not
posed
at
all
under
the...
by
a
hospital
receiving
money
under
medicare.
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--actually
i
don't
think
our
theory
covers
student
loans
at
all
because
the
federal
assistance
doesn't
ever
make
its
way
to
the
school.
the
federal
assistance
under
the
loan
program
are
interest
rate
subsidies
and
the
guaranteed
loan
that
goes
to
the
bank.
so...
but...
but
the...
so,
it's
not
at
all
like
the
medicare
program
in
which
all
the
federal
money
goes
straight
to
the
hospital.
there
is
nothing
the
beneficiary
can
do
to
direct
the
money
to
go
to
him
or
herself,
and
the
hospital
cannot
bill
the
patient
for
medicare
services.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there
is
no
such
distinction
under
the
statute.
so,
it's
true
that
the
record
didn't
reflect
how...
whether
this
hospital...
all
the
money
was
under
part
a
or
part
b.
but
this
court...
court
will
recall
from
all
its
medicare
cases,
what
the
hospital
does,
it
takes
all
its
costs
and
tells
the
government
what
they
were
under
this
very
complicated
system,
and
all
the
money
goes
to
the
hospital.
so,
what...
no
matter
what
the
service
is
that
the
hospital
is
providing,
the
federally
funded
service,
all
money
flows
to
the
hospital.
the
patient
can't
say,
well,
i
want
the
money
to
go
to
myself
and
then
i'll
pay
the
hospital.
and
that
is
somewhat
significant
because
the
hospital
gets
a
huge
advantage
from
that
system
in
that.
they
don't...
the
hospital
doesn't
have
to
rely
on
the
solvency
or
the
good
will
of
the
patient.
the
money
goes
to
the
hospital.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and
essentially,
justice
scalia,
that
is
no
different
than
the
prototypical
financial
assistance
programs
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
this
statute.
the
model
cities
program,
the
ceta
program
were
all
instances
in
which
all
the
government
did
was
give
money
to
an
organization
to
provide
the
cost
and
expenses
for
providing
services
to
needy
individuals
under
those
assistance
programs.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
they
didn't
give
money
away.
they
gave
job
training,
career
counseling,
and
other
kinds
of
community
development.
there
are
a
lot
of
garden
variety
assistance
programs
in
which
what
the
government
does
is
gives
a
grant
to
an
organization
to
turn
around
and
provide
counseling
or
training
or
educational
services
to
intended
beneficiaries.
we
reimburse
states
for
immunization
programs
so
they
can
provide
preventative
health
services
to
needy
citizens.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
a
reimbursement
system.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
yes.
the
hospitals
are
paid--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right,
the
hospital
is
paid
in
advance.
secondly,
under
the
model
cities
program,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
salinas,
it
had
to
first
spend
the
money
and
then
seek
a...
a
funding
request
from
the
government.
and
the
state
immunization
programs
work
the
same
way.
you
reimburse
the
states.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there
are
a
lot
of
benefit
programs
in
which
the
service
provider
could
have
charged
the
fee,
but
what
the
government
is
doing
is
providing
a
federal...
federal
funding,
a
benefit
program,
by
providing
funds
to
the
organization
to
turn
around
and
use
those
funds
to...
to
provide
the
services.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
we
know
that
from
the...
the
statute,
the
regulations,
and
in
good
samaritan
actually
the
court
concerned
this
very
payment
structure
to
preserve
the
hospital's
liquidity.
what
the
statute
and
the
regulations
do
is
provide
an
advance
funding
mechanism
that
tries
to
estimate
what
the...
the
services
the
hospital
will
perform,
and
then
there's
the
quarterly
adjustments
throughout
the
year.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
required
by
the
statute
that
that's
how
they
have
to
be
paid.
but,
no,
it's
not
in
the
record.
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
don't
think
it
matters.
what
the...
what
the
statute
does
or
how
the
program
works
is
that
they're
paid
twice
a
month
based
on
what
they
think
they're
going
to
be
paid
for
the
whole
year.
and
so,
whether
or
not
the
service
has
been
provided
or
a
claim
has
been
submitted,
the
hospital
gets
the
money.
but
it--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
the
fact...
but
whether
or
not
they
provided
the
services
is
irrelevant.
they
still
get
the
money.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
sorry.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
a
bimonthly
thing,
and
so
the...
the
hospitals
are
advanced
the
money
until
there's
been
a
reconciliation
to
see
whether
they're
ahead
or
behind.
but
our
fundamental
point
is
not
that
they
get
the
money
beforehand
or
they
get
the
money
after.
the
fundamental
point
is
that
when
there
is
corruption
by
hospital
officials,
the
medicare
program
suffers.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
okay.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
what
our--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
the
best
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
medicare
is
essentially
a
grant
to
hospitals
that
is
calibrated
to
the
cost
of
providing
the
federally
funded
services.
it
is
true
the
beneficiaries
are
the
patients...
the
program
beneficiaries.
but
that
is
no
different
than
the
prototypical
financial
assistance
programs
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
this
statute,
and
whether
in
the
model
cities
program
they
said
to
an
organization,
here's
$1
million,
please
improve
the
life
of...
of
city
residents
or
they
say
to
a
hospital,
here's
$1
billion
or
$100
billion,
provided
federally
funded
medical
services
to
elderly
people
who
are
qualified
to
get
those
services
under
the
program.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
the
food
stamp
program
works...
works
differently
because
the
federal
benefit
is
the
coupon
which
is
essentially
like
cash,
although
it's
earmarked
cash
because
it
can
only
be
spent
at
the
grocery
store.
but
if
the
individual
burns
his
coupon
or
it
gets
stolen
or
he
loses
it,
that's
it.
and
in
the
hospital
case,
all
the
money
flows.
there's
just
no
interference
by
or
interruption
by
the
beneficiary,
the
elderly
patient.
he
or
she
goes
in
for
a
procedure.
the
hospital
gets
paid.
and
again,
this
is...
this
is
so
much
like
the
garden
variety
assistance
program
where
what
congress
does
is
compensates
an
entity
for
providing
services.
and
this
is
the
model
cities
program.
it
was
to
improve
the...
the
living
conditions
of
the
city
residents.
under
the
ceta
program,
which
was
at
issue
in
the
mosley
case,
it
was
job
training,
career
counseling.
and
in
the
community
development
block
program,
the
beneficiaries
were
people
who
needed
housing
assistance
and
what
they
did
was
rehabilitate
people's
homes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
they
might.
there
are
lots
of
organizations
now
that
provide
career
counseling
or
even
drug
counseling
services,
but
they
still
get
grants
under
the
federal
government
to
do
those
same
kinds
of
services.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
they
are.
if
that
person...
if
i
went
in
for
drug
counseling
or
drug
rehabilitation,
presumably
i'd
have
to
pay
for
the
service.
they're
not
giving
it
to
me
for
free.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
my
parents
or
i
might
have
trust
fund
that
covers
it,
but
if
it's
done
under
a
federal
grant,
then
it's...
it's
a
benefit
to
me,
but
the
institution
that's
providing
those
services
are
receiving
the
benefit
funds.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
applies
to
recipients
of...
of
benefits,
and
that's
talking
about
the
benefit
funds
or
other
items
of
value.
and
there's
just
no
question
that
medicare
is
a
classic
federal
assistance
program.
it
directly
provides
those
benefit
funds
to
the
hospitals
that
turn
around
and
use
those
funds
to
provide
assistance
to
individuals.
before
medicare
was
enacted,
a
lot
of
people
got
these
services
for
free.
and
what
medicare
did
was...
was
say,
we
don't
want
elderly
people
to
have
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
hospitalization
when
they're
over
65
because
it
could
ruin
them
financially.
so,
this
is
just
a...
a
quintessential
assistance
program
where
the
hospital
is
receiving
the
benefit
funds.
if
i
could
turn
briefly
to
subsection
(c),
which
the
petitioner
also
relies
on,
our
position
is
that
what
subsection
(c)
does
is
it
prevents
a
routine
commercial
payment...
excuse
me...
that
is
referring
to
routine
commercial
compensation
payments
to
individuals.
that
section
talks
about
bona
fide
salary
or
wages
or
other
forms
of
compensation
or
reimbursement--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
it's
significant
that
the
word
corruptly
was
added
to
the
statute
at
the
same
time
subsection
(c)
was
added
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
the
types
of
payments
to
individuals
described
in
subsection
(c)
would
not
be
prosecuted
as
corrupt
payments.

right.
the
same
thing
could
be
said
of
the
bank
bribery
statute
which
subsection
(c)
was
lifted
verbatim
from.
that
is,
18
u.s.c.
215(c)
is
the
bank
bribery
provision.
that
provision
also
prohibits
the
corrupt
payments
of
individuals.
congress
added
the
word
corrupt
at
the
same
time
it
added
subsection
(c)
and
identical
language.
the
same
thing
happened
a
year
later
with
this
section,
section
666(c),
and
the
legislative
history
is...
is
unambiguous
on
this
point,
that...
that
section
666
prohibits
the
corrupt
payment
and
not
these
routine
kinds
of
commercial
payments
to
individuals.
and
another
problem
with
petitioner's
reading...
and
this
is
similar
to
our
point
on
the...
on
the
subsection
(b)...
is
that
to
exclude
any
kind
of
compensation
or
reimbursement
or
expenses
paid
to
an
organization
would
exclude
the
very
kinds
of
assistance
programs
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
this
statute.
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
word
contract
in
subsection
(b)
which
shows
that
congress
obviously
contemplated
the
federal
government
would
get
consideration
in
exchange
for
providing
benefit
funds
to
organizations.
and
the
last
point
i
want
to
leave
the
court
with
is
it's
very
significant
that
this
statute
applies
to
organizations,
governments,
and
agencies.
it
doesn't
apply
to
individuals.
the
jurisdiction
applies
to
the
entities.
the
criminal
defendant
is
an
individual,
but
the
jurisdiction
reaches
organizations,
governments,
and
agencies,
even
though
the
beneficiaries
of
most
assistance
programs
are
in
fact
individuals.
and
that
is
because
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
is
when
you
have
corruption
directed
at
the
recipient
that
provides
the
services,
the
beneficiaries
of
the
program
are
hurt.
ms.
lisa

yes,
it
has...
right.
it
has
to
be
an
organization,
government,
or
agency,
and
it
also
has
to
be
a
transaction
involving
$5,000
or
more.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
