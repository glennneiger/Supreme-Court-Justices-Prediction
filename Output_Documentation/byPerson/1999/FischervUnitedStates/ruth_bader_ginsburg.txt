bader

mr.
horwitz,
before
we
go
on
to
your
parade
of
horribles,
i
take
it
from
what
you've
said
distinguishing
the
fiscal
intermediary
from
the
provider,
that
all
hospitals
that
administer
medicare
that
receive...
that
receive
the
actual
dollars,
they
are
out
from
under
the
statute.
so,
could...
the
government
could
go
after
the
fiscal
intermediary,
but
could
not
go
after
the
hospital
that
actually
receives
the
federal
dollars.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
the...
the
program
that
we
have
before
us,
the
medicare
program.
the
hospital
you
said
gets
paid.
it
doesn't
get
aid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
horwitz,
are
you...
are
you
distinguishing
salinas
on
that
basis,
and
in
salinas
it
was
the
municipal
unit
that
had
the
jail
that
is
administering
the
federal
funds?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
answer
is
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
would
you
answer
that
question?
in
the
salinas
case,
was
the
organization
itself
receiving
benefits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
the
horribles.
and
i
gather
from
footnote
12
on
page
31
in
your
brief
you
often
see
these,
the
grocery
store
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
make
the
same
distinction
with
respect
to
the...
the
government
insured
tuition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
horwitz
made
some
distinction
between
patient
assigned
benefits
and
payments
that
would
go
directly
to
the
hospital
that
aren't
dependent
on
a
patient
assignment
and
said
that
there
was
no
showing
here
that
the
direct
payment
rather
than
the
assigned
benefit
applies.
