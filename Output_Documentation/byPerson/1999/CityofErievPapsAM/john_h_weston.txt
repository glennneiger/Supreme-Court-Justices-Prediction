mr.
john
h.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
is
made
clear
throughout
these
proceedings
and
by
the
remarks
today,
erie's
only
concern
in
considering,
adopting,
passing,
and
enforcing
this
ordinance
was
the
notion
of
nude
entertainment.
the
language
that
justice
o'connor
quoted
was
accurate
and
illustrative
of
exactly
what
erie's
purposes
were.
what
makes
this
case
so
unusual
was
that
erie
was
unusually
candid
in
terms
of
exactly
what
their
true
content-based
motivations
were
in
connection...
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
for
a
number...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
in
some
sense
barnes
itself
is
authority
for
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
if
the
only
issue
that
was
relevant
in
this
kind
of
analysis
was
what
is
the
literal
language
of
the
legislation,
barnes
would
have
been
a
very
brief
series
of
opinions
in
connection
with
the
evaluation
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
legislation.
but
in
fact
there
were
three,
as
this
court
knows
well,
full
opinions,
each
of
which
traced
the
history
of
the
statute,
analyzed
it,
its
impact,
what
motivated
the
framers,
what
didn't
motivate,
how
it
was
being
enforced,
and
so
forth.
where
we
deal,
as
we
do
here,
with
a
piece
of
legislation
which
has
the
ability
to
dramatically
impact
substantial
amounts
of...
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
o'connor,
i've
heard
you
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the...
mr.
john
h.
weston
it
certainly
stated
what
was
in
the
preamble
of
the
ordinance.
interestingly,
however,
in
that
preamble
the
preamble
noted
that
it
was
concerned,
if
the
city
of
erie
was
concerned
about
creating
an
atmosphere
conducive
to
the
possible
creation
of
these
so-called
secondary
effects,
as
opposed...
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
splitting
hairs
here,
but
i
think
it's
important
in
terms
of
the
whole
secondary
effect,
content-based,
pretexual
analysis...
that
all
that
the
city
was
concerned
about
was
the
notion,
well,
that
maybe
something
might
be
created
in
which
something
else
might
happen
somewhere,
some
place,
not
terribly
unlike
some
of
the
comments
that
are
made
about
television.
but
i
think
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
analysis
of
even
though
there
may
be
in
the
face
of
the
preamble
some
suggestion
that
secondary
effects
played
a
role,
number
1,
there's
certainly
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
support
the
notion
that
either
there
were
secondary
effects
or...
mr.
john
h.
weston
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
keeping
that
in
mind,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
erie
was
required
to
do
its
own
studies,
but
the
point
is
that
erie
had
no
evidence,
unlike
renton,
which
interestingly,
as
the
chief
justice
points
out,
didn't
do
its
own
studies,
but
simply
relied
on
studies
that
had
been
done
by
neighboring
seattle
some
years
before,
erie
not
only
didn't
do
its
own
studies,
but
did
not
rely
on
any
studies.
the
only
thing
in
the
legislative
record
reflective
of
any
cerebration
or
consideration
about
this
piece
of
legislation
was
the
unanimous
statements...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
perhaps
they
did,
but
if
they
did,
then
they
were
obligated
to
at
least...
mr.
john
h.
weston
oh,
but
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
enacting
legislature...
excuse
me.
the
enacting
legislature
is
obligated
to
consider
substantial
evidence
in
connection
with
its
evaluation
and
decisionmaking
with
respect
to
it.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
its
own.
when
the
chief
justice
says,
well,
perhaps
they
read
the
renton
case,
but
if
they
read
the
renton
case,
then,
like
renton,
what
their
obligation
was
to
do
was
to
assert
that
they
read
the
renton
case...
mr.
john
h.
weston
and
followed
it
and
it
was
an
influence
of
that...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i
suppose
it
depends
on
what
the
state
of
the
evidence
is
over
what
period
of
time
and
so
forth,
and
what
particular
businesses,
but
this
court,
not
terribly
long
ago
in
turner
ii,
made
it
very
clear
that
in
consideration
with
the
must-carry
provisions
in
congress
that
in
order
to
evaluate
content
neutrality
it
was
necessary
for
there
to
be
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
before
congress
which
congress
considered
in
connection
with...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i
suppose...
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well...
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
particularly
because
the
potential
for
pretextual
enforcement
and
pretextual
legislation
is
simply
too
great,
and
in
connection
with
legislation
which
has
the
potential
and
the
reality
of
restricting
vast
quantities
of
protected
expression
in
order
to
minimize
that
pretextual
burden,
it
is...
the
pretextual
potential...
it's
not
a
very
great
burden
from
a
first
amendment
potential
to
require
an
enacting
legislature
simply
to
articulate
the
legitimate
concerns
that
it
has,
what
is
motivating
it,
and
the
basis
on
which
it
is
passing...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
in
that
sense,
justice
ginsburg,
it
would
have
been
operating
in
more
familiar
territory
in
the
sense
of
adopting
some
sort
of
adult
zoning
legislation
which,
interestingly,
erie
of
course
had
in
existence.
mr.
john
h.
weston
your
honor...
mr.
john
h.
weston
it's
a
difficult
analysis,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
reason
it's
a
difficult
analysis
is
because
prior
counsel
responsibly
brought
to
the
court's
attention
the
circumstances
of
the
ownership,
lack
of
ownership,
sale
of
the
property
and
so
forth,
at
the
earliest
possible
moment,
when
he
learned
about
it.
the
motion
was
properly
made
to
the
court,
and
the
court
denied
the
motion.
when
i
say
it's
a
hard
question,
i
stand
here
before
you
having
spent
the
last
3
months
following
this
court's
dismissal
of
the...
or
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
so
i
suppose
i'm
personally
somewhat
conflicted
in
connection
with
the
efforts
that
we
put
forward
with
respect
to
this.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes.
the
corporation
is
technically
still
extant.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
however,
justice
scalia,
nothing
differs
from
what
the
motion
to
dismiss
said,
which
is
to
say
that
the
owner
of
the
corporation
sold
the
property.
there
is
no
adult
business
on
the
premises.
the
owner
of
the
property
has
no
other
involvement
in
any
other
adult
business
in
erie
or
anywhere
else,
and
has
no
intention
to
resume
such
activity.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
probably
because
at
least
as
far
as
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
consideration
of
the
case,
the
matter
is
concluded.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
petition
for
rehearing
that
was
filed
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
denied,
and
as
far
as
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
concerned,
there
was
a
full,
litigated
hearing...
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
john
h.
weston
of
course
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
h.
weston
if
i
may
make
it
in
the
simplest
possible
terms,
at
this
juncture
the
motion
has
been...
and
i
don't
really
know
else
how
to
say
it
this
way.
the
motion
was
made,
it
was
responsibly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
court
denied
it.
we've
prepared
for
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
we're
here
to
proceed
as
the
court
wishes.
the
opinion
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
appears
to
be
final
as
far
as
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
concerned,
but
with
respect
to
it,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
circumstances
would
have
been
terribly
different
with
respect
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
if
the
relevant
individual
had
died
as
opposed
to
simply
going
out
of
business
and
no
longer...
mr.
john
h.
weston
again,
as
i've
tried
to
suggest,
it
seems
to
me,
in
terms
of
the
litigation
and
the
litigants,
that
the
matter
was
fully
briefed,
fully
litigated,
and
fully
decided
in
an
adversarial
proceeding
at
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
and
it
was
final
as
to
that
court.
to
the
extent
that
the
plaintiff
no
longer
has
a
further
interest
in
the
matter,
it
would
appear
that
to
the
extent
that
this
court
deems
it
appropriate
to
moot
the
action,
that
that
would
leave
the
situation
as
the
status
quo
ante
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
and
i
think...
but
conversely,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
thought
that
the
reasoning
that
you
expressed
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
honig
case
about,
from
the
perspective
of
mootness,
that
once
a
case
had
reached
this
court
and
had
been
accepted
for
jurisdiction,
that
perhaps
the
traditional
mooting
criteria
should
drop
off.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
have
never
noted
any
temerity
on
the
part
of
the
chief
justice
to
be
alone
in
that
or
any
other
circumstances.
mr.
john
h.
weston
absolutely,
justice
stevens.
the...
this
court
has
never
utilized
secondary
effects
as
a
justification
for
a
total
ban
on
protected
activity.
obviously,
i
have
a
familiarity
with
when
secondary
effects
first
entered
the
lexicon
in
young
v.
american
mini
theaters
and,
of
course,
it
was
utilized
then
in
the
analyses
with
which
you
and
i
are
familiar.
mr.
john
h.
weston
just...
yes,
exactly
yes
to
the
question.
justice
souter's
opinion
sought,
it
seemed
to
me,
to
utilize
the
notion
of
secondary
effects
which
have
traditionally
been
applied
solely
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
a
particular
location,
perhaps
in
a
time,
place,
and
manner
context,
to
the
much
more
draconian
and
speech-burdening
concept
of
totally
banning
everywhere
in
a
jurisdiction
vast
quantities
of
presumptively
protected...
mr.
john
h.
weston
justice
souter,
i
think
that
in
fact,
with
all
respect,
o'brien
was
absolutely
not
a
secondary
effects
case,
because
the
nature
of
the
harm
asserted
by
the
government
in
the
face
of
the
challenge
to
the
antidraft
card
destruction
statute
on
the
basis
of
its
expressive
impact
was
that
the
destruction
of
the
draft
card
in
and
of
itself,
and
the
deprivation
of
the
draft
card,
was
the
very
thing
that
congress
had
targeted
with
the
specific
new
legislation.
the
chief
justice
was
very,
very
clear
at
the
time
that...
and
your
honor,
justice
souter,
you
may
recall
that
in
o'brien
there
had
been
new
legislation
adopted
which
is
what
had
been,
what
had
triggered
the
prosecution's...
mr.
john
h.
weston
but
the
prior
legislation
had
required
that
all
registrants
maintain
in
their
possession
their
draft
card
and
their
classification
certificate.
the
new
legislation
banned
the
destruction
of
the
card
and
the
certificate,
and
the
expression
of
the
court
in
upholding
the
legislation
was
simply
that
it
was
very
important
to
the
selective
service
that
everybody
maintain
in
their
possession
a
draft
card
and
the
classification,
so
that
what
was
at
issue
in
o'brien
was
not
secondary
at
all,
but
absolutely
and
primary
effect,
and...
mr.
john
h.
weston
please.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
the
primary
reason
is,
is
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
assertion
that
some
secondary
or
tertiary
or
far
distant
activity
is
what
is
the
source
of
concern
to
government,
and
that
on
that
basis
there's
going
to
be
a
dramatic
restriction
or
banning,
total
banning
of
expression,
it
simply
is
too
far
removed
from
the
nature
of
the
expression
which
is
protected,
or
which
we
seek
to
protect
under
the
first
amendment
and
our
general
approaches
to
it.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes.
i
think
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
exactly
the
point,
whether
because
it
simply
isn't
important
enough,
whether
it
simply
isn't
linked
enough
to
justify
terminating
or
banning
expression,
or
whether
it
simply
doesn't
give
us
enough
of
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
potential
pretextual
application
of
an
asserted
justification
for
silencing
unpopular
expression.
and
that's
really
what
makes
these
cases
difficult,
because
with
respect
to
adult
entertainment
the
businesses
are
enormously
unpopular
with
city
government,
or
county
government.
government
is
terribly
hostile
with
respect
to
these
businesses,
and
what
seems
to
happen,
unfortunately,
really
much
like
what
erie
did.
erie
had
a
specific
target
in
mind.
it
was
only
nude
dancing.
it
was
only
nude
entertainment.
but
what
erie
did,
instead
of
passing
direct
legislation
which
implicated
what
their
sole
concern
was
and
then
allowing
that
legislation
to
be
challenged
in
the
crucible
of
strict
scrutiny,
where
there
could
be
a
fair
evaluation
of
really
what
was
going
on
in
the
situation,
erie
wrapped
its
limited
and
specific
concern
inside
a
piece
of
legislation
of
seemingly
general
applicability.
mr.
john
h.
weston
justice
scalia...
mr.
john
h.
weston
justice
scalia,
there
was
already
a
state
statute
in
pennsylvania
which
would
have
prohibited
exactly
the
conduct
to
which
your
honor
refers.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
state...
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
h.
weston
not
nude
dancing
in
private,
in
a
private
circumstance
where
there
was
no
affront,
where
nobody
was
going
to
be
offended,
where
there
was
no
possibility
for
juveniles.
the
only
remaining
gap
in
the
state
and
city
legislation
was
nude
entertainment,
which
is
specifically
what
erie
targeted,
as
they
were
candid
enough
to
say
in
their
preamble,
as
their
legislators
were
candid
enough...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
problem,
the
objection
in
this
setting
is
that
we
are
all
being
asked
to
participate
in
some
sort
of
charade.
erie
had...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i
suggest
that
it's
a
charade
in
this
sense.
if
erie
were
to
have
passed
its
ordinance
specifically
targeting
the
only
interest
it
had
in
passing
the
legislation,
it
would
be
viewed
as
a
direct
and
specific
restraint
on
expression...
mr.
john
h.
weston
but
that's
what
the
charade
is,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
where
we
deal
with
expression,
and
where
there's
legislation
that
either
inevitably
is
going
to
affect
vast
quantities
of
expression,
or
where
on
its
face,
or
where
it
will,
just
simply
by
virtue
of
its
passage,
affect
enormous
amounts
of
recognized
expression,
we
ought
not
to
countenance
the
notion
of
true
judicial
strict...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i
think
the
difference
is,
justice
breyer,
that
in
this
case
and
in
these
cases
we
deal
with
expression,
we
deal
with
the
most
elevated
aspect
of
our
society.
mr.
john
h.
weston
and...
mr.
john
h.
weston
thank
you.
i
just
want
to
say
that
in
the
ordinary
course
the
fish
statute
with
respect
to
trying
to
hurt
somebody
individually
tends
not
to
be
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
likely
going
to
happen.
it
will
be
an
unusual
setting,
something
that
will
be
fairly
easy
to
prove,
and
be
something
that
will
be
palpable.
with
respect
to
the
expression
setting,
we
do
not
permit
government
simply
to
have
the
easy
ability
to
interfere
with
expression
absent
demonstrable
justifications,
whether
they...
of
a
content-neutral
nature
in
order
to
establish
the
justification,
whether
it
be
compelling
need
or
otherwise,
to
interfere
with
what
otherwise
in
our
society
is
presumptively
protected,
and
it
makes
it
worse
in
this
case,
because
at
least
on
the
basis
of
barnes
we
had
eight
justices,
all
of
whom
noted
and
held
that
this
kind
of
expression,
this
kind
of
entertainment
was
protected.
now...
and
i
know
i
interrupted
your
question.
forgive
me,
please,
if...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
firstly,
with
respect
to
the
notion
that
there
might
be
nude
dancing
which
involves
prostitution,
or...
mr.
john
h.
weston
of
course.
mr.
john
h.
weston
our
view
is
that
under
this
ordinance
and
on
this
record,
because
we
are
making
a
facial
challenge
to
this,
this
ordinance
does
not
regulate
touching,
prostitution,
or
whatever.
the
legislation
that
we
challenge,
and
the
only
legislation
that
we
challenge,
interdicts
and
prohibits
only
nude
dancing.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
other
nude
dancing
about
which
government
is
concerned,
there
are
certainly
state
prostitution
statutes
in
pennsylvania,
the
point
being
that
from
our
perspective
the
nature
of
the
dance,
and
dance
itself,
is
a
recognized
form
of
expression.
mr.
john
h.
weston
if
there
were
going
to
be
that
assertion
made
and
that
conclusion
drawn,
justice
scalia,
it
ought
to
be
done
under
a
standard
of
strict
scrutiny
to
be
able
to
evaluate
the
relationship
between
the
asserted
prohibition
and
the
impact
on
speech
in
a
meaningful
way
that
is
protective
of
expression...
mr.
john
h.
weston
but
this
ordinance,
although
seemingly
one
of
general
application,
unlike
the
antiburning
legislation
to
which
you
referred
in
the
streets,
inevitably
has
an
impact
on
a
recognized
form
of
vast
quantities
of
expression.
mr.
john
h.
weston
it
may
well
be,
but
in
terms
of...
and
it's...
and
in
terms
of
the
number
of
examples
of
which
flag-burning...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
saying
this
poorly.
the
amount
of
speech
that
is
potentially
interdicted
by
the
anti-leaf-burning
legislation
in
texas
to
which
you
refer
is
minimal
compared
to
the
impact
on
speech
of
a
piece
of
legislation
that
specifically
bans
all
nudity
at
all
times
in
1999,
when
nude
entertainment
has
become
a
significant
staple
of
the
american
cultural
scene,
which
means
that
there
are
vast
numbers
of
not
only
nude
dancers...
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
h.
weston
our
office
is
no
longer
there,
but
my...
our...
[laughter]
as
the
amicus
briefs
made
clear,
there
are
something
like
3,000
adult
clubs
throughout
the
united
states,
that
there
was
more
income
generated
from
those
establishments
than
from
all
theaters,
plays,
drama
groups
throughout
the
united
states
combined.
the
point
is
that
in
the
nude...
in
the
leaf-burning
situation,
the
potential
impact
on
expression
was
minimal.
in
this
circumstance,
both
on...
particularly
on
this
record,
where
the
absolute
basis
for
passing
it
was
limited
exclusively
to
expression,
it
is
inappropriate
to
use
the
deferential
standard,
whether
of
rational
basis,
which
you,
justice
scalia,
employed
in
barnes,
or
even
o'brien
itself,
o'brien
not
having
been
designed
for
that
kind
of
circumstance
and
that
kind
of
situation,
either
because
there
was
no
showing
of
a
content-neutral
basis
for
the
legislation,
number
1,
or
because
simply
of
the
application
of
the
legislation.
mr.
john
h.
weston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
