justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
closing
the
business?
isn't
that
evidence,
too?
i
mean,
physically
he
closed
something,
it's
gone,
he
sold
the
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
has
no
property,
he
says
he's
not
going
to
do
it
any
more,
and
you
in
response
to
that
say,
what?
you
say
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
sure
we
have
the
power
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
change
your
mind
on
the
likelihood
of
the
conduct
recurring?
quickly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
if...
does
the
record
show
that?
there
are
some...
if
i
think
that
some
forms
of
this
might
involve
no
more
than
selling
a
sexual
favor,
like
prostitution,
no
expression,
no
nothing,
but
other
forms
of
this
might
be
simply
a
low-brow
kind
of
art,
in
which
case
you're
starting
to
distinguish
among
kinds
of
art,
so
all
would
depend
on
what
it
is,
a
matter
which
the
record
is
totally
silent
about?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
i
do
think
that.
i'm
saying
that
hypothetically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
this...
are
you...
did
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
people
walking
down
the
street
without
any
clothes
on?
is
that
what
they
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
said
they
struck
them
because
they
thought
they
were
unconstitutional.
if
they
had
been
constitutional,
would
they
say
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
they
don't
apply
except
to
clubs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perhaps.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
that...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
find
it
difficult
to
figure
out
how
to
administer
that
principle.
i
mean,
i
am
familiar
with...
i
have
some
sympathy
to
it,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
works.
that
is,
the...
because
legislatures
don't
normally
say
always
what
their
actual
motive
is,
so
if
they
pass
legislation
dealing
with
importing
fish,
but
their
real
objective
is
to,
you
know,
hurt
somebody
individually,
are
we
supposed
to
start
looking
into
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that.
the
other
question
i
have...
i
see
where
you're
going
on
that,
but
the
other
question
i
have,
which
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
finish
that
if
you'd
like,
because
if
you're
going
to
say
a
special...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
a
different
question,
which
is,
i
don't
see
quite
how
to
proceed.
the
first
assumption
would
be...
it's
an
assumption
that
there
are
some
kinds
of
nude
dancing
that
are
not
expressive
at
all,
rather,
they're
forms,
let's
say,
of
prostitution,
or
sexual
behavior,
and
second,
that
maybe
that's
what
they're
going
after
here,
and
third,
if
it's
so,
how
would
i
know?
there's
no
record.
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
it
involves
prostitution.
i
mean,
it
is
no
more
related
to
expression
than
turning
a
mouse
loose
in
a
house
with
an
intent
to
frighten
someone.
you're
intending
to
get
a
reaction,
and
that
doesn't
have
to
do
with
aesthetics,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
expression.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
take
it
your
predecessor
here
refused
to
make
any
stipulation
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
expression
here,
i.e.,
expression
as
we
normally
mean
it
in
a
political
or
language
or
aesthetic
sense,
i.e.,
not
to
do
with
that,
and
i
take
it
there
was
no...
you
know,
they
wanted
to
stipulate
there
was
some
kind
of
expression,
and
you
said
no.
your
side
said
no.
do
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
and
you
might
disagree
with
it.
you
might
say
there
is
no
such
kind
of
nude
dancing;
all
nude
dancing
is,
in
fact,
aesthetic.
is
that
your
view?
or,
it
could
be,
no,
there
is
some,
but
it's
mixed
up
with
other.
what
is
your
view?
