justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
karle,
going
back
to
the
issue
that
justice
o'connor
raised
on
whether
this
is
content-based,
she
asked
you,
as
i
recall,
whether
it
was
content-based
because
it
seems
to
be
directed
to
the
particular
category
of
nude
dancing,
not
nudity
generally.
as
you
answer
that,
i
wonder
if
you
would
consider
a
variation
on
that
question,
which
is
what
was
the
nub
of
what
was
bothering
me
here
as
a
seeming
distinction
from
the
situation
in
glen.
the
statute
by
its...
the
ordinance,
rather,
by
its
terms
seems
to
cover
all
nudity.
the
reference
to
it
is,
appears
in
the
state
of
nudity,
to
describe
what
is
proscribed,
but
there
is
at
the
same
time
the
preamble
that
says,
what
we're
really
concerned
with
here
is
nude
dancing,
and
there
is
a
representation
in
the
record...
it
may
have
been
from
you.
i
forget
now...
to
the
effect
that
the
statute
is
not
going
to
be
enforced
against
legitimate
theater
productions
like
equitus,
equus
and
oh
calcutta
and
so
on.
and
so
my
variation
on
the
question
is
this.
it
sounds
as
though
perhaps
facially
you
could
say
it
covers
all
nudity,
but
as
applied
it
certainly
is
not
covering
all
nudity
and
distinctions
are
being
made,
insofar
as
i
can
tell
they
are
being
made
on
the
basis
of
content,
on
the
basis
of
the
artistic
quality
of
the
production
in
which
the
nudity
occurs.
equus
is
left
alone.
the
barroom
dancing
is
not
left
alone.
so
on
either
justice
o'connor's
theory
or
my
theory,
isn't
a
content-based
distinction
being
made
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
barnes
ordinance,
the
assumption
of
our
decision,
or
our
decisions,
i
guess,
of
those
of
us
who
would...
did
uphold
the
barnes
ordinance,
the
assumption
was
that
it
applied
across
the
board,
and
that,
in
fact,
hadn't
been
challenged.
and
i
think...
i
did
not
go
back
and
reread
my
opinion,
but
i
read
excerpts
from
it
in
the
brief,
and
my
recollection
is
that
i
said,
you
know,
if
it
turns
out
that
either
an
overbreadth
challenge
or
some
kind
of
a
challenge
to
the
effect
that
it
is
not
being
enforced
across
the
board
were
made,
that
might
be
a
different
case,
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
this
is
that
different
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
they
were
concerns
about
constitutionality,
and
i
didn't
remember
whether
it
was
you
or
somebody,
whoever
was
representing
the
city
said...
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
in
fact
the
way
we're
going
to
enforce
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
wants
to
take
a
kind
of
strict
original
intent
approach
to
its
statutes
and
say,
despite
the
generality
of
the
language
it
only
applies
to
the
occasion
for
its
enactment,
i...
would
you
say
that
we
should
override
pennsylvania's...
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
construction?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
the
point
was...
whether
it
was
a
wise
or
an
unwise
point
i'll
leave
for
the
judgment
of
my
peers,
but
i
think
the
point
was
that
the
o'brien
case
itself
was
a
secondary
effects
case.
i
didn't
reread
o'brien
before
this,
but
my
recollection
is
that
the
concern
with
the
burning
of
the
draft
card
was
that
the
destruction
of
draft
cards
would
make
it
difficult
to
administer
the
draft
laws.
it
was
not
a
sort
of
talismanic
injury
to
the
draft
card
itself.
so
that
in
fact
the
occasion
for
the
o'brien
holding
was
to
look
ahead
to
what
this
kind
of
act
is
going
to
threaten
for
the
future
throughout
a
system,
and
it
may
or
may
not
be
wise
to
extend
the
kind
of
sexual
secondary
effects
into
the
o'brien
rationale.
i
thought
it
was,
but
i'm
willing
to
hear
argument
on
it,
certainly,
from
those
who
disagree.
but
i
think
that
brien
was
a
kind
of
secondary
effects
case...
o'brien.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
reread
o'brien
before
this
argument,
so
i'll
take
your
word
with...
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
the
distinction
is
to
be...
i
know...
maybe
i
shouldn't
pursue
this,
because
i
don't
think
this
case
turns
on
it,
but
i'll...
one
last
question.
i
promise
you
it's
my
last
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
that
the
primary-secondary
distinction
can
be
made
here
on
viewing
o'brien
as
you've
just
described
it,
why
should
that
make
a
difference?
it
may
make
a
difference
in
proof
of
effect,
in
proof
of
harm,
but
why
should
that
make
a
difference
in
principle?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
a
secondary
effect,
almost
by
definition,
is
something
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
importance
to
justify
it.
that...
