justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
just
one
further
question
on
it?
i
was
surprised
that
you
weren't
content
with
saying,
in
response
to
the
mootness
suggestion,
well,
fine,
then
we
must
wipe
out
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
decision,
because
you
didn't
get
your
crack
at
appealing
it.
how
can
the
plaintiff
say,
i
won
this
wonderful
victory,
and
now
i'm
going
to
go
out
of
business,
but
i'm
going
to
preserve,
immune
from
any
further
review,
this
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
that
equus
in
fact
played?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
didn't
make
any
effort
to
stop
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
didn't
say
the
reason
you
did
because
you...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
thought
the
constitution
required
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
knew
that
equus
was
playing
in
town?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
karle,
what
about
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
that
interpreted
its
law?
it
seemed
to
read
that
preamble
almost
as
a
substitute
provision
of
the
statute.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
thought
that
that
preamble
counted,
and
in
determining
whether
it
does
or
not,
don't
we
owe
some
respect
to
the
way
the...
pennsylvania's
highest
court
construes
pennsylvania
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
said
something
about
the
preamble,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address,
not
its
treatment
of
barnes,
but
whether
the
preamble
counted
in
determining
the
validity
of
this
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
part
that
i
remember,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is,
it
referred
to
something
that
was
stated,
the
very
words
that
justice
o'connor
quoted
to
you
from
the
preamble.
that
wasn't
something
unstated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
thought
that
that
preamble
counted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
asking
you
about
the
relationship
between
two
high
courts,
pennsylvania's
highest
court
and
this
court,
and
doesn't
this
court
owe
some
respect
to
the
way
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
construed
that
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
weston,
would
the
city
of
erie
have
had
to
do
that
if,
instead
of
saying
there
shall
be
no
totally
nude
dancing,
it
said,
there
shall
be
no
totally
nude
dancing
establishments
within
a
certain
distance
from
each
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
isn't
the
proper
result
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision
should
be
vacated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
interpreting
the
federal
constitution
deliberately,
not
the
state
constitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
city
of
erie
successfully
persuaded
this
court
to
hear
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
at
that
point,
why
isn't
it
fair
to
say,
all
right,
it's
out
of
business,
but
you
can't
ask
for
a
voluntary
dismissal
without
prejudice
this
late
in
the
game,
which
is
essentially
what
you're
asking
for?
you're
saying,
yeah,
we
won
in
the
supreme
court,
we
want
to
carry
on
that
victory,
but
the
case
is
moot,
so
it's
essentially
a
voluntary
dismissal
that
you're
asking
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i
take
you
say,
you
made
the
motion,
it
was
denied,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
i'm
asking
you
to
consider,
suppose
the
motion
were
held
in
abeyance,
and
you
say,
we
went
out
of
business,
we
want
to
withdraw
from
the
field.
wouldn't
the
proper
answer
be,
okay,
but
the
judgment
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
vacated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
karle,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did,
in
its
list
of
14
facts
that
it
considered
important,
say
the
play
equus,
which
featured
frontal
nudity,
did
appear
in
the
city
of
erie.
isn't
the
matter
of
enforcement
a
part
of
the
case,
at
least
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
thought
it
was
dealing
with?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
on
page
27a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
it's
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
decision
that
you're
challenging.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
the
trial
court
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did...
i
don't
recall,
then,
did
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
mention
that?
