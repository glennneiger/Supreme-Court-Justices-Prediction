justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
try
it
and
speak
up,
if
you...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
content
neutrality,
the
ordinance
at
issue
in
barnes,
as
i
recall,
prohibited
public
nudity
in
general.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
this
erie
ordinance,
the
preamble
to
the
ordinance
notes
that
it
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
a
recent
increase
in
nude
live
entertainment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
distinguish
this
erie
ordinance
from
barnes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
seems
to
have
been
addressed
to
a
specific
problem,
making
it
perhaps
not
content-neutral.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
line
of
cases
that
says
voluntary
cessation
doesn't
moot
a
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
evidence.
he's
said
he
isn't
going
to.
he's
finished.
he's
out
of
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
you
don't
have
anything
in
opposition
to
that,
except
you
say,
well,
he
could
change
his
mind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not,
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
a
minute
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
the
preamble
is
different,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
that.
it
says
the
intent
is
to
focus
and
prohibit
nude
live
entertainment.
i
mean,
that's
what
it
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
o'connor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
except
the...
pennsylvania's
highest
court
has
said
that
at
least
one
purpose
of
this
ordinance
was
to
prevent
secondary
effects
of
an
unfortunate
kind,
sex
crimes
and
that
kind
of
thing,
and
i
guess
we
accept
that
as
a
purpose
of
this
statute,
to
curtail
the
secondary
effects
created
by
live,
nude
entertainment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
go
further
and
say
that
a
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
was
to
prevent
unfortunate
secondary
effects
such
as
an
increase
in
sex
crimes,
am
i
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
the
city
of
erie,
pennsylvania,
enacted
an
ordinance
banning
public
nudity.
the
respondent,
pap’s
a.m.
which
operate
at
a
nude
dancing
establishment
in
erie
known
as
“kandyland”,
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
claiming
that
it
violated
respondents
right
to
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment.
pennsylvania
supreme
court
held
the
public
nudity
sections
of
the
ordinance
violated
respondent's
first
amendment
rights.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
we
conclude
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
although
pap’s
is
no
longer
operating
“kandyland”
as
a
nude
dancing
establishment,
this
is
not
a
“run
of
the
mill
voluntary
cessation”
case.
here
it
is
the
plaintiff
who,
having
prevailed
below,
seeks
to
have
the
case
declared
moot.
and
it
is
this
defendant
city
that
seeks
to
invoke
the
federal
judicial
power
to
obtain
this
court’s
review
of
the
decision.
the
city
has
an
ongoing
injury,
which
the
court
can
remedy;
and
to
the
extent
that
it
has
an
interest
in
resuming
operations,
pap’s
still
has
a
concrete
stake
in
the
outcome.
on
the
merits,
we
hold
that
erie’s
ordinance
is
a
content-neutral
regulation
that
should
be
evaluated
under
the
intermediate
scrutiny
standards
set
forth
in
united
states
versus
o’brien.
under
that
standard,
a
content-neutral
regulation
will
be
upheld,
if
it
furthers
an
important
government
interest
and
the
incidental
restriction
on
first
amendment
freedoms
is
no
greater
than
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
that
interest.
we
note
that
in
this
case,
like
the
most
recent
previous
nude
dancing
case
we
decided,
the
court
has
produced
a
multitude
of
opinions.
nevertheless,
in
an
effort
to
describe
the
holding,
a
majority
of
the
court
agrees
that
erie’s
ban
on
public
nudity
is
content-neutral
and
must
be
evaluated
under
the
o’brien
standard.
the
ordinance,
by
its
terms,
regulates
conduct,
not
speech,
and
it
bans
all
public
nudity
regardless
whether
it’s
accompanied
by
expressive
activity.
as
the
pennsylvania
court
construed
the
language
in
the
preamble,
one
purpose
of
the
ordinance
is
to
combat
the
negative
secondary
effects,
such
as
crime
and
other
threats
to
public
health
and
safety
that
are
caused
by
the
presence
of
nude
dancing
establishments.
although
there
is
only
a
plurality
of
the
court,
which
would
hold
that
the
ordinance
satisfies
all
four
parts
of
the
o’brien
test,
six
members
of
the
court
agree
that
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
which
justice
thomas
has
joined;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
