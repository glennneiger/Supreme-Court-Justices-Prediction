chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-1161,
city
of
erie
v.
pap's
a.m.,
doing
business
as
kandyland.
mr....
spectators
are
admonished,
don't
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
is
still
in
session.
mr.
karle.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
karle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
karle,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
you
should
lower
the...
i
think
the
trouble
is,
it's
too
high.
crank
it
down,
and
i
think
we
might
hear
you...
the
other
side.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
what...
and
what's
the
basis
for
that
statement?
the...
i
mean,
is
there
some
evidence
that
this
corporation
is
likely
to
resume
the
sort
of
business
it
had?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
just
kind
of
up
in
the
air?
he's
quit
the
business,
and...
but
you're
saying
he
might
resume
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
subject?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
we've
explored
that
as
much
as
we
need
to.
why
don't
you
return
to
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
follow
that...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
make
any
representation
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
as
to
the
application
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
absolutely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
karle.
mr.
weston,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
weston,
you
talk
about
motivation,
but
if
the
ordinance
on
its
face
applies
across
the
board,
does
motivation
really
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
held
in
city
of
renton
v.
washington,
whatever
it
was,
that
the
legislature
didn't
have
to
make
a
study
of
individual
situations.
it
could
rely
on
what
other
legislatures
had
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
they
read
the
city
of
renton
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
city
of
renton
says
that
you're
obligated
to
make
your...
to
consider
your
own
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
probably
what
the
city
of
renton
did,
but
eventually
if
enough
cities
do
that,
can't
it
be
simply
treated
as
datum
that
these
kind
of
things
do
bring
bad
secondary
effects?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
it
might
depend
on
whether
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
regards
itself
as
being
bound
in
the
same
way
we
do
about
not
deciding
moot
cases.
in
a
couple
of
cases
that
we've
heard
here,
we
have...
duremas,
for
example...
we
have
simply
dismissed
an
appeal,
feeling
that
we
don't
have
the
authority
to
vacate
a
state
court
judgment
the
way
we
would
a
federal
court
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
alone
in
the
honig
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
sort
of
thing
you're
talking
about
happens
all
the
time,
it
seems
to
me.
it
happened
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
the
newly
freed
slaves,
and
yet
they
wrote
a
provision
much,
much
more
broadly
than
that.
frequently,
a
particular
incident
will
cause
legislation
to
be
passed
and
the
legislation
is
broadly
framed.
i've
never
thought
there
was
any
objection
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it...
it's
only
a
charade
if
the
ordinance
is
in
fact...
is
going
to
be
enforced
only
against
nude
dancing
places,
and
really,
as
justice
scalia
says,
someone
walking
down
the
main
street
of
erie
in
the
nude
will
not
be
prosecuted,
but
i
don't
get
any
suggestion
of
that
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
they
had
a
good
lawyer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weston.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
karle,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
didn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
karle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1161,
the
city
of
erie
versus
pap’s
a.m.
will
be
announced
by
justice
o’connor.
