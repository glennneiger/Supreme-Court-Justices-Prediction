before
we
get
too
much
into
the
merits
of
this
case,
there's
a
contention
that
the
case
may
be
moot.
can
you
talk
about
mootness?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the...
is
this
business
still
in
operation,
pap's?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
in
business
somewhere
else?
as
i
understood
it,
he's
out
of
business.
he's
70
years
old,
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
claim
he's
not
out
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
enough?
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
anybody
could
get
back
into
business,
but
then
there's
no
such
thing
as
mootness.
i
mean,
if
a
person
stops
the
business
and
has
no
intention,
expresses
no
intention
of
going
back
into
it...
justice
antonin
scalia
he
sold
the
place.
he
doesn't
even
have
the
property
any
more,
is
that
right,
and
the
only
reason
you
think
the
case
is
still
alive
is
because
the
corporation
is
still
in
existence?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
unfortunately,
those
cases
involve
voluntary
cessation
by
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
voluntary
cessation
by
the
plaintiff.
this
is
the
plaintiff
who
says,
you
know,
i
was
really
mad
at
the
city
for
closing
me
down,
but
now,
i
don't
really
care.
i'm
going
to
florida.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
couldn't
care
if
they
close
me
down
or
not.
i've
made
mine
and
i'm
leaving
erie,
pennsylvania.
i'm
getting
out
of
the
rust
belt.
i'm
going
to
florida.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
would
change
your
mind...
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
indeed
the
reason
you
would
allow
equus,
because
you
think
the
constitution
requires
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
the
constitution
did
require
it,
would
you
allow
nudity
in
equus?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
that
be
unlawful
subject
matter
discrimination,
if
it's
required
by
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
unlawful
subject
matter
discrimination
if
it's
required
by
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
you're
saying
is,
you
will
enforce
this
ordinance...
even
if
you
said
you
would
do
it,
not
enforce
it
for
equus,
you're
saying
you
will
enforce
it
to
the
extent
the...
you
will
enforce
it
by
its
terms
to
the
extent
the
constitution
permits
enforcement
by
its
terms.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
we
do
have
some
matters
in
our
obscenity
law
jurisprudence
about
redeeming
artistic
or
social
value,
don't
we,
and
some
people
might
think
equus
has
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
there
may
be
some
reason
to
think
that
lap-dancing
is
a
little
different
from
equus
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned.
this
case
does
not
involve
lap-dancing,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
you
had
people
who
had
been
walking
down
main
street
in
the
buff,
the
prologue
might
have
said,
we've
had
a
lot
of
people
walking
down
main
street
in
the
buff,
and
so
we
think
there's
a
need
for
a
statute
against
public
nudity,
and
that
statute
would
be
generally
applicable,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
it
was
prompted
by
one
particular
incident,
or
series
of
incidents,
doesn't
render
it
any
less
generally
applicable,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
anybody
construe
it
that
way?
i
mean,
if
the
supreme
court
said,
you
know,
black
is
white,
would
we
not
think
that
maybe
they
misspoke?
by
its
terms,
the
ordinance
applies
to
all
nudity,
does
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
prologue
says
what
prompted
this
ordinance,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
that's
all
the
ordinance
applies
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
possibly
have
said
that
the
ordinance
only
applies
to
nude...
did
it
ever
say
that
it
applies
only
to
nude
dancing?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
republican
form
of
government
provision.
we
haven't
applied
it
before,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
read
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
opinion,
they
do
seem
to
assume
what
has
been
brought
up
in
the
discussion
here,
that
the
immediate
motivation
for
this
statute
was
the
appearance
of
a
lot
of
nude
dancing
establishments,
and
they
acknowledge
that.
and
then
they
go
on
and
seem
to
indicate
that
that
motivation
for
it
is
enough
to
vitiate
it
under
the
constitution,
but
i
don't
see
that
they
anywhere
say
that
it
only
applies
to
nude
dancing
establishments.
they
seem
to
regard
the
fact
that
it
was
prompted
by
the
appearance
of
the
nude
dancing
establishments
as
enough
to
render
it
not
content-neutral,
which
is
quite
different
from
what's
being
suggested.
and
you
agree
with
that,
too,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
weston,
i
gather
you
now
think
this
case
is
moot?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
hard
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
didn't
get
this
notion
from
nowhere.
i
thought
you
asserted
it
was
moot.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
state
of
affairs?
the
corporation
is
still
in
existence?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
seeming...
do
you
really
think
that
if
someone
would
walk
nude
down
the
main
street
in
erie
he
would
not
be
arrested
under
this
ordinance?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
think
this
ordinance
only
is
going
to
be
applied
to
nude
dancing
establishments?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
nude
dancing?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
nude
dancing?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
is,
and
so
is
burning
a
flag,
i
suppose,
and
with
burning
a
flag
we
would
certainly
say
that
if
there
were
a
general
law
against
burning
anything
in
the
public
streets
and
you
happened
to
burn
a
flag,
although
it
is
a
form
of
expression,
the
state
has
rendered
that
particular
form
of
expression
unlawful
for
reasons
unconnected
with
the
expression
itself,
and
therefore
the
statute
is
constitutional.
why
shouldn't
we
say
the
same
thing
about
nude
dancing?
it
may
well
be
a
form
of
expression,
but
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
is
being
expressed,
but
which
have
to
do
simply
with
the
nudity,
that
particular
form
of
expression
has
been
rendered
unlawful.
express
the
thought
in
some
other
way,
just
as
you
must
express
the
thought
in
some
other
way
than
burning
a
flag
in
the
public
streets.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
accept
it,
that
it's
strict
scrutiny.
it
certainly
is
strict
scrutiny
in
the
flag-burning
case,
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
our
decision
in
johnson,
which
said
that
the
law
specifically
directed
against
burning
flags
was
unconstitutional,
would
have
come
out
the
other
way
if
it
were
a
general
municipal
ordinance
against
burning
matter
in
the
street,
leaves,
flags,
rags,
anything
else.
that
surely
would...
if
he
was
prosecuted
for
that,
he
surely
would
have
been
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
but
so
does
prohibiting
the
burning
of
a
flag.
in
fact,
it's
to
my
mind
a
much
more
cognizable
communication
of
an
idea
than
dancing
is,
nude
or
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
where
in
america
you
are,
mr.
weston.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
come
from
beverly
hills,
and
it
may
well
be
out
there,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
say
that
throughout
america.
