mr.
gregory
a.
karle
karle.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
karle.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1994,
the
city
of
erie
enacted
a
content-neutral
blanket
prohibition
against
public
nudity.
that
ordinance
was
patterned
after
a
similar
ordinance
which
was
passed
on
by
this
court
in
1991
styled
barnes
v.
glen
theatre.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
okay.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
our
ordinance
was
challenged.
it
went
through
our
intermediate
trial
level
and
intermediate
appellate
system,
and
was
passed
on
by
our
state
supreme
court.
on
review,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
acknowledged
that
first
amendment
protection
was
extended
to
nude
barroom
dancing,
as
was
found
in
barnes
v.
glen
theatre.
it
declined
to
find
any
other
guidance
in
barnes.
our
state
supreme
court
engaged
in
its
own
independent
analysis
in
rejecting
our
contention
that
the
ordinance
was
content-neutral.
the
city
challenged
the
ordinance...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
justice
o'connor...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
our
position
is,
reference
to
content
does
not
make
the
ordinance
content-specific,
or
content-based.
the
intention
of
that
preamble
was
to
acknowledge
the
prior
holdings
of
this
specific
court,
which
granted
certain
limitations
to
this
type
of
expressive
conduct.
the
whole
text
of
the
ordinance
is
an
ordinance
of
general
application.
it
applies...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
as
i
understand
it,
the
location
where
it
operated
initially
in
1994
no
longer
exists.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i...
in
an
affidavit
presented
by
the
respondent,
he
claims
to
be
out
of
business.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
filed
a
response...
they
still
keep
their
corporation
in
an
active
status,
so...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
it's
enough
that
he
could
get
back
into
business...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
we've
also...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that
was
one
reason
we
asserted
in
our
petition
in
response
to
mootness.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
we
also
cited
a
number
of
reasons.
if
i
can...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
we
cited
those
in
our
response
to...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
justice
scalia,
we
also
indicated
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
same
controversy
will
occur
between
the
same
parties.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
know.
there's
no
evidence
before
us
which
suggests
that
he
couldn't
do
it.
the
man
hasn't
died.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
in
our
mind,
what
this
case...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
there
is
an
affidavit,
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
yes,
the
property
was
sold.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
if
i
may,
the
corporate
records
of
this
entity
indicate
a
number
of
shareholders.
mr.
panels
wasn't
the
only
one.
i
don't
believe
there
was
an
affidavit
submitted
by
those
individuals.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
would
be
content
if
this
court
could
order
that
this
matter
be
remitted
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
order
vacated.
it
was
not
my
understanding
that...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
it
was
not
my
understanding
that
it
was...
this
court
could
do
that,
but...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
but
if
in
its
wisdom
it
could,
i
would
invite
it
to
do
so.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
would
say
no,
justice
souter.
the
preamble
purely
acknowledges
the
restrictions
on
nude
barroom
dancing
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
1991.
it
sets
the
parameters
of
the
ordinance,
which
this
court
held
were
constitutional.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
and
if
i
can
address
two
points,
justice,
the
first
is,
you
pointed
to
some
references
in
the
record
which
attribute
statements
to
me
which
suggests
that,
or
state
that
this
will
not
be
enforced
against
plays
such
as
hair,
or
equus,
or
other
theater
productions.
as
i
stand
here
now,
before
this
court,
we
are
standing
on
the
face
of
this
ordinance
and
it
would
be
and
it
could
be
applied
to
those
types
of
productions.
the
reasons
for
those
statements
were
concerns
of
the
trial
court,
and
we
tried
to...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no,
that
was
me.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
absolutely
not,
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
if
the
constitution
required
it,
the
plaintiff...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
pardon
me,
justice?
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
absolutely
not,
not...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
your
honor...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
well,
first
of
all,
judge,
anything
i
did
was
evidenced
in
the
record,
and
the
intent
was
to
try
to
get
the
trial
court
to
give
the
statute
a
limiting
construction.
he
seemed
to
be
troubled
by
that.
i
don't
think
i'm
able
to...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
and
that
would
be
beyond
my
abilities
as
the
city
solicitor...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no,
no,
no.
i...
that's
not
to
mean
i
was
making
a
misstatement
to
the
trial
court.
he
didn't
understand
my
position.
that's
my
point.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
yes,
it
did.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
and...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no.
the
respondents
portrayed
that
situation
as
a
conscious,
deliberate
effort
on
our
part
to
withhold...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
right,
and
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
on
that
in
the
cert
petition
at
page
27a,
14,
the
trial
court
said
the
play
equus,
which
featured
frontal
nudity,
did
appear
in
the
city
of
erie
in
october
and
november
1994,
after
passage
of
the
ordinance.
and
i
know
there
was
discussion
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
this
was
a
conscious,
deliberate
effort,
but
all
we
acknowledge
is,
the
play
was
here,
and
it
wasn't
enforced,
and
if
i
can
go
outside
the
record,
the
reason
is,
no
one
complained.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
it
may,
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
but
certainly
we
were
not
trying
to...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
there
was
lap-dancing
in
these...
in
the
bar,
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
justice
breyer...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
justice
breyer,
if
i
can
address
that,
i
believe
that
that
issue
was
already
addressed
squarely
in
the
barnes
case,
and
it
put
limitations
on
regulation
of
nude
barroom
dancing,
and
we
took
the
almost...
almost
identical
language
of
barnes,
incorporated
it
in
our
ordinance,
and
are
applying
the
law
as
it
was
stated
in
1991
in
that
case.
we
aren't
making
any
judgments
as
to...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
the
preamble
simply
to
acknowledge
your
prior
holding
in
1991.
the
respondents
would
have
us...
have
the
court
believe
that
by
the
city
acknowledging
a
precedential
case,
that
somehow
vitiates
the
ordinance
and
makes
it
content-neutral.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
but
justice
connor,
that's
not
what
the
whole
ordinance
said.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
o'connor.
but
that's
not
what
the
whole
ordinance
says.
the
whole
ordinance
speaks
to
regulation
of
public
nudity
in
all
places.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
all
we
would...
[laughter]
all
legislation
makes
mention
of
content.
that
may
be
the
triggering
point
for
an
ordinance
or
a
statute,
but
just
to
mention
it,
or
mention
the
content
and
acknowledging
a
trigger
in
point
doesn't
make
it
content-specific.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
disagree.
i
believe
the
court
failed
to
make
any
distinction
in
the
two
ordinances
in
barnes.
i
believe...
that's
our
supremacy
clause
argument.
what
the
court
did
was
simply
apply
the
minority
view
in
barnes
and
gave
our
ordinance...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
the
state
supreme
court,
although
it
found
that
our
ordinance
had
a
purpose
grounded
in
secondary
effects,
it
said,
stated
that
it
was
overshadowed
by
an
unstated
motive,
so
it
really
doesn't
go
on
to
tell
us
the
distinguishing
features.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no,
it
was
not.
that
was
definitely
in
the
preamble.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
believe
that
the
respondents
have
conceded
that
point.
if
you
refer
to
their
brief
at
footnote
2,
it
says
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
articulate
one
important...
distinguished
between
the
case
and
barnes.
it
expressly
noted
that
the
ordinance
on
its
face
stated
that
it
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
a
recent
increase
in
nude
live
entertainment.
this,
rather
than
justice
white's
dissent
in
barnes
were
the
basis...
if
this
were
the
basis
rather
than
justice
white's
dissent,
then
their
reasoning
would
square
with
the
judgment,
so
relying
even
on
what
our
opponents
are
saying,
they
didn't
make
that
square
distinction
to
hinge
the
decision.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i...
it
could
accord
it.
our
position
is
they
didn't...
they
found
the...
they
found
barnes
and
they
found
the
erie
ordinance
strikingly
similar.
they
did
not
go
along
and
distinguish
the
ordinance.
if
they
did...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
if
they
did...
if
they
did,
we
wouldn't
be
here...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that
certainly...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
justice
stevens,
that
certainly
wasn't
in
the
opinion
or
the
rationale
in
the
pennsylvania...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
think
you're
mandated
to.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
the
ultimate
effect,
because
they
struck
those
provisions
in
the
ordinance,
walking
nude,
walking
around
nude.
they
struck
them.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
perhaps,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
we
provided
a
number
of
analyses
that
the
supreme
court
could
have
utilized
in
order
to
reconcile
the
various
opinions
in
barnes
such
that
it
could
construe
our
ordinance.
in
a
nutshell,
what
we
are
saying
is,
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
as
it
did
because
it
couldn't
reconcile
either
the
plurality
or
the
concurring
opinions
of
the
barnes
case.
i
suggest
that,
just
looking
at
barnes,
there
aren't
five
votes
to
mandate
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review,
so
therefore
the
court
was
in
clear
error
in
utilizing
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review
in
applying
that
review
to
the
city's
ordinance.
we
believe
our
ordinance
withstands
intermediate
scrutiny.
the
pennsylvania
court
acknowledged
a
purpose
in
the
ordinance.
they
termed
it
secondary
effects.
absent
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
reliance
on
the
unstated
motive
for
finding
the
ordinance
unconstitutional,
which
was
drawn
from
the
barnes
dissent,
the
regulation
passed
was
unrelated
to
expression.
we
utilized
the
same
criteria,
the
o'brien
criteria,
in
the
form
of
regulating
the
type
of
nudity
and
to...
what
we're
saying
is,
to
the
extent
the
expression
is
affected,
the
ordinance
is
no
more
restrictive
than
necessary.
in
other
words
pasties
and
g-strings
requirement
in
barnes
are
the
same
in
ours,
therefore
the
court
should
have
found
our
ordinance
constitutional
on
strict
scrutiny.
because
erie's
ordinance
is
substantially
indistinguishable
from
the
statute
in
barnes,
the
pennsylvania
court
was
constrained
to
uphold
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve?
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
the
statute
in
barnes,
which
we
utilized
as
the
pattern
for
our
ordinance,
simply
is
to
accord
the
same
amount
of
protection
and
the
same
regulation
as
in
barnes.
that's
the
limitation,
notwithstanding
the
argument
that
it
makes
it
content-specific.
my
opponent
also
pointed
to,
in
his
argument,
a
state
statute
regulating
something
in
the
nature
of
sex
crimes.
that
is
in
our
crimes
code,
and
that
requires
an
intent
element.
our
ordinance
does
not
require
an
intent.
it's
a
conduct
ordinance,
being
in
a
state
of
nudity...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
it
would
cover
walking
down
the
street
in
the
nude
if...
a
person
commits
a
misdemeanor
in
the
second
degree
if
the
person
for
the
purpose
of
arousing
or
gratifying
sexual
desire
of
himself
or
any
person,
other
than
his
spouse...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
well,
no...
[laughter]
well,
no,
it's
a
crime
in
pennsylvania
if
the
intent
is...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
gratifying
sexual
desire
is
the
crime.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
under
our
ordinance,
not,
because...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
can't
speak
to
upper
macungie
township,
or...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
but
at
any
rate,
justice
stevens,
it
requires
an
intent
element.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i'm
unfamiliar
with
that
provision.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
that's
the
trial
court's...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
yes.
that's
just
the
trial
court...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
no,
they
didn't...
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
i
don't
believe.
mr.
gregory
a.
karle
thank
you.
