justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
that
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
wait
a
minute...
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
please,
counsel?
you
made
a
solemn
representation
in
open
court
to
the
judge,
and
you're
saying
that...
you
do
not
stand
by
that
representation?
i'm
not
asking
you
why
you
made
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
you
did
make
a
representation
on
the
record
that
this
ordinance
would
not
be
enforced
against
those
two...
in
those
two
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
should
we
not
therefore
assume
that
you...
that
the
city
will
do
exactly
what
you
said
the
city
would
do
in
the
open
court
proceedings
that
are
part
of
this
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
really
care
what
the...
i
don't
really
care
what
your
intent
was,
it
was
strategic,
tactical,
or
what,
but
you
did
make
a
representation
as
to
the
city's
policy
in
enforcing
this
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's...
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
does
not
involve
lap-dancing,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
told
it
it
didn't
apply
to
theater
productions
of
nudity,
so
it
probably
relied
on
that
in
assuming
that
maybe...
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
quite
might
mean
what
it
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
secondary
effects
for
a
minute,
now
that
we're
through
with
discussing
mootness?
do
you
agree
that
if
there
were
secondary
effects
here,
such
as
justice
souter
described
in
his
opinion,
that
that
would
justify
a
total
prohibition
on
the
activity,
or
that...
did
that
doctrine
merely
apply
to
the
location
where
the
activity
may
take
place?
do
you
think
there's
a
distinction
there,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
suggest
that
perhaps
justice
souter's
opinion
in
barnes
is
inconsistent
with
that
submission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
the
state
statute
cover
walking
down
the
street
in
the
nude?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
pennsylvania
it
is
perfectly...
every
place
except
erie,
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
a
citizen
to
walk
down
the
street
in
the
nude
if
he
just
wants
to
get
a
lot
of
sunshine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he
doesn't
have...
his
intent
is
to
sunbathe
as
much
as
possible.
is
that
a
crime
in
pennsylvania
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
pennsylvania,
for
the
purpose
i
described,
you
may
walk
around
nude.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
in
downtown
erie,
but
in
the
rest
of
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
but
as
a
matter
of
state
law
it's
perfectly
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
pretty
good
answer
to
his
argument.
