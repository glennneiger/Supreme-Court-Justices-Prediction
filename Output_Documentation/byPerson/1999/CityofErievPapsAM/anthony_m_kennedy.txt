justice
anthony
m.

all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
your
answer
is
getting
worse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said,
you
know,
i
said
this
to
the
trial
court
so
i
could
win
in
the
trial
court,
but
i'm
not
going
to
say
it
here
so
i'm
going
to
win
here.
that's
what
i'm
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ah,
well...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
could
anybody...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
again,
that
was
an
enactment
for
the
first
time.
does
the
congress
have
to
do
it
every
time
once
it's
made
this
line?
that's...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case
the
question
is
whether
or
not
these
kinds
of
established...
create
secondary
effects.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
having
been
some
determination
on
that,
including
the
supreme
court
opinions,
can't
cities
rely
on
that?
