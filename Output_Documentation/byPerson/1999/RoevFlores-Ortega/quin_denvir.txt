mr.
quin
denvir
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
address
a
couple
of
matters
that
came
up
in
questioning,
and
one
of
them
is
this
factual
question
of
california
law.
the...
on
page
26,
that
was
quoted
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
statement...
mr.
quin
denvir
i'm
sorry.
it's
of
the
supplemental
excerpts
of
record.
mr.
quin
denvir
they
are
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
parties
did
not
put
them...
but
it
was
quoted
by
mr.
dumont,
about
where
the
client
said
that
of
the
15
years
i
would
only
do
5-1/2.
that
statement
was
made
after
the
sentencing.
this
was
not
part
of
the
plea
bargain.
the
question...
mr.
quin
denvir
7-1/2,
i'm
sorry.
did
i
say
5-1/2?
here's
what
was
said.
did
you
tell
that
prisoner
at
that
sentencing,
your
attorney
did
not
tell
you
what
the
procedures
were
at
the
sentencing?
well,
all
she
told
me
was
to
go
to
jail
trusting
her,
that
of
the
15
years
i
would
only
do
7-1/2,
so
this
was
not
part
of...
before
the
plea
bargain.
it
was
after
the
sentencing.
the
other
thing
is
that
it's
incorrect
under
california
law.
under
california
law,
you
can
only
get
one-third
off
of
that
minimum
eligibility
of
15
to
life,
so
you
cannot
be
eligible
for
parole
until
you
have
served
at
least
10
years,
and
after
that
you
still
have
to
be
found
suitable
for
parole,
so
just
as
a
factual
matter
that
is...
that
was
incorrect.
but...
and
there's
also
this
question
that
justice
souter
had
raised
about
whether
there
was
predetermined
sentence
in
this
case.
there
was
not
a
predetermined
sentence
in
this
case.
what
followed
from
his
plea
of
second...
to
second
degree
murder
was
that
he
would
either
be
sentenced
to
15
years
to
life,
or,
in
an
unusual
case,
he
could
get
probation.
that
was
not
ruled
out
by
the
plea
agreement,
and
in
fact
the
entire
sentencing
argument
was
about
that.
his
lawyer
argued
at
great
length
that
he
should
be
given
probation,
and
it
was
unusual.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
certainly
is
not
common,
but
it's
certainly
possible,
and...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i
couldn't
say
it's
likely.
i
couldn't
say
that.
mr.
quin
denvir
he
was
not
promised
probation;
he
was
not
promised
15
years.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
the
statement
has
been
made
over
and
over
again
that
there
were
no
arguable
issues
in
this
appeal.
there
were
two.
mr.
quin
denvir
yes.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
do.
i
do,
and
the
reason
is
that
there's
a
california
supreme
court
case
called
people
v.
harvey.
people
v.
harvey
states
that
when
you
have
a
plea
bargain
with
plea
to
certain
counts
and
dismissal
of
other
counts,
the
other
counts
cannot...
the
facts
underlying
them
cannot
be
considered
on
sentencing
on
the
counts
to
which
were
pled.
in
this
case,
almost
the
entire
argument
against
probation
was
the
district
attorney
talking
about
the
facts
underlying
the
count,
so
there
was
a
harvey
error
that
may
have
been
a
basis
for
a
reversal
of
the
sentencing
and
going
back
again.
mr.
quin
denvir
i'm
sorry,
what
were
the
facts...
mr.
quin
denvir
the
factual
basis
was
that
there
was
testimony
that
he
had
stabbed
the
victim,
who
had
died
as
a
result
of
it,
and...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
assume
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
it
was
available
under
california
law,
and...
mr.
quin
denvir
it
is
conceivable.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
the
factors
that
could
have
been
affected
by
this
argument
of
the
district...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
the
rule
provides
that
you
can
get
probation
if
the
facts
or
circumstances
giving
rise
to
the
limitation
on
probation
is,
in
this
case,
substantially
less
serious
than
the
circumstances
typically
present,
and
the
defendant
has
no
recent
record
of
committing
similar
crimes
or
crimes
of
violence.
mr.
quin
denvir
the
provocation,
the
question
of
the
drawing
of
the
gun
by
the
other
person,
the
fact
there
was
a
general
melee.
there
was
a
very
good
argument
that
this
was
either
in
self-defense,
or
imperfect
self-defense.
the
problem
was
that
you
had
to
show
that
you
didn't
have
any
prior
or
similar
crimes
of
violence.
the
district
attorney
violated
the
harvey
rule
by
using
the
facts
of
the
dismissed
counts
to
argue
that
he
did
have
prior
crimes
of
violence
and
couldn't
get
probation.
now,
that
is
a
very
arguable
issue
that
he
was
deprived
of.
the
second
arguable
issue
that
he
was
deprived
of
is,
he
wanted
to
challenge
this
conviction.
this
was
a
man
who
had
pled
guilty
under
great
protest,
always
saying
that
he
was
innocent
during
this.
now,
the
court
in
north
carolina
v.
alford
said
that
that
is
okay,
that
you
can
have
a...
you
can
plead
guilty
if
you
in
fact...
while
also
maintaining
your
innocence,
but
the
court
did
say
that
there
are
certain
things
that
have
to
be
done
in
that
situation,
and
one
of
them
is
that
the
judge
taking
the
plea
must
first
make
sure
there's
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
and
the
judge
here
did
that.
the
preliminary
hearing
transcript
and
testimony
was
sufficient
for
that.
mr.
quin
denvir
this
was
an
alford
plea,
your
honor,
and
the
second
part
is,
the
court
said
in
alford
that
this
kind
of
plea
should
not
be
taken
until
the
judge
taking
the
plea
has
inquired
into
and
sought
to
resolve
the
conflict
between
the
waiver
of
trial
and
the
claim
of
innocence.
there
was
no
attempt
to
do
that
at
all,
and
there
was
a
real
claim
of
innocence
here.
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
17,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
plea
colloquy,
the
court
said
to
mr.
flores,
you
would
really
like
to
have
your
trial,
wouldn't
you,
mr.
flores?
he
said,
well,
i
would,
but.
the
court
said,
all
right,
then
we're
going
to
bring
up
the
panel.
the
defendant
said,
but
i
haven't
finished.
i
haven't
finished
explaining.
i
would,
but
seeing
that
i
am
alone,
i
am
with
the
help
of
no
one,
it's
better
that
i
plead
guilty.
now,
that
should
have
triggered
an
inquiry
from
the
court
as
to
why...
this
is
a
defendant
who
just
previously
had
asked
for
a
different
lawyer,
and
we
believe
there
would
have
been
an
arguable
issue
under
alford.
mr.
quin
denvir
the
decision
below
was
made
on
the
basis
that
there
was
not
a
decision
by
the
client
to
forego
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
they
did
not
address
that
question.
mr.
quin
denvir
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
should
be
a
requirement
that
a
defendant
in
this
position
have
arguable
grounds.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
what
i...
the
reason
we
don't
is
because
basically
what
was
said
by...
in
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
pigaro
last
year,
that
it
really
puts
an
unfair
burden
on
a
pro
se
petitioner
in
the
first
initial
habeas
to
be
able
to
develop
arguable
issues
without
the
assistance
of...
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
the
question
is,
how
will
that
be
determined?
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
say,
the
trial
counsel
thought
there
were
no
arguable
issues
on
appeal.
i've
cited
to
the
court
two
very
arguable
issues
on
appeal.
but
i
think
the
key
point
is
that
the
state
focuses
strictly
on
the
question
of,
was
there
a
request
for
appeal
or
not?
our
belief
is,
and
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
joined
it,
that
the
first
question
is,
is
there
a
duty
to
give
some
advice
to
the
client
about
an
appeal
and
find
out
what
the
client
wishes
to
do
in
that
regard,
because
the
court
held
in
jones
v.
barnes
that
this
decision
whether
to
appeal
or
not
is
one
of
those
fundamental
decisions
that
is
decided...
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor...
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
in
this
case...
mr.
quin
denvir
in
this
case...
mr.
quin
denvir
in
this
case
he
would
have
certainly
appealed,
because
he
said
he
wanted
to
keep
on
fighting
the
case.
he
was
very
unhappy
with
both
the
conviction
and
with
the
sentence.
mr.
quin
denvir
because
some
defendants...
mr.
quin
denvir
when...
because
some
clients,
some
large
number
of
clients,
when
they
are
told
that
there
is
nothing
there,
when
they
realize
that
the
sentence
is
pretty
much
what
they
received,
they're
not
unhappy
with
the
representation
that
led
up
to
the
plea
agreement,
will
decide
not
to
appeal.
there
are
waivers
of
appeal...
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
there
are
many
plea
agreements
that
have
a
waiver
of
appeal
as
part
of
them,
and
the
client
agrees
to
it.
they
understand
what
is
going
to
happen,
and
they're
willing
to
live
with
that.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
and...
mr.
quin
denvir
he
may
very
well
have
received
exactly
what
he
expected
to
get.
mr.
quin
denvir
he
may
very
well
do
that,
and
then,
and
other
people...
the
other
reason
he
may
not
is
because
there
may
be
adverse
consequences
that
could
flow
from
filing
an
appeal,
as
we
pointed
out,
you
can
actually
be...
win
on
appeal
and
receive
a
more
severe
sentence,
and
in
california
you
can
actually
have
your...
you
can
lose
on
appeal
and
have
your
sentence
increased
in
a
substantial
amount,
so
there...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
that
the
circuit,
as
the
state
would
view
it,
did
not
focus
and
develop
the
advice
of
counsel
question,
and
went
merely
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
decision
not
to
appeal,
and
in
terms
of
the
question
of
prejudice,
we
believe
that
the
circuit's
decision
that
all
you
have
to
show
is
that...
is
the
loss
of
a
direct
appeal
of
right
with
counsel,
that
is
prejudice.
that's
actual
prejudice
under
strickland.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i...
in
the
cases
that
the
court
has
decided...
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
that
if
trial
counsel
usurps
the
decision
on
whether
to
appeal
that
is
not
trial
counsel's
to
make,
they
will
force
the
client
to
forfeit
the
right
to
an
appeal
where
counsel
will
address
these
issues
on
a
full
appellate
record
and
determine
whether
there's
an
anders
problem
or
a
meritorious...
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
the
problem
is,
how
will
the
court
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
no
issues
on
appeal?
that,
under
the
court's
jurisprudence,
is
determined
with...
mr.
quin
denvir
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
quin
denvir
we...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
penson,
but
in
one
of
the
court's
appeals
decisions,
even
though
the
state
court
had
found
no
meritorious
issues,
the
court
reinstated
the
appeal
because
they...
the
court
believed
that
the
defendant
had
a
right
to
counsel
with
the
advocate's
view
of
the
case,
and
that...
mr.
quin
denvir
should
be
substituted.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
difficulty
here
is,
the
reason
we're
on
collateral
attack
is
because
there
was
a
loss
of
the
right
to
appeal
because
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
and
as
a
result,
the
client
lost
the
ability
to
pursue
these
issues
on
direct
appeal
with
counsel,
and
this
counsel
never
claimed
to
provide
mr.
flores-ortega,
with
his
third
grade
education
and
his
spanish-speaking
ability,
any
information
about
the
appeal,
didn't
say
that
this
is
your
decision,
you
have
a
right
to
appeal,
these
are
the
kinds
of
issues
you
can
raise,
you
may
need
to
get
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
if
you
want
to
attack
the
guilty
plea,
all
that...
all
the
information
that
a
client
needs
to
make
the
personal
decision
whether
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
or
not.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
and
i
believe
that's
why
the
court
has
never
required
that
in
a
comparable
situation,
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
for
the
concurring
opinion
in
pigaro
which
said
that
really
it's
unfair
and
impractical
to
expect
a
counsel-less
petitioner
to
be
able
to
do
the
legal
work
to
show
the
court
whether
there
are
or
not
meritorious
issues,
and
instead,
if
counsel
does
his
or
her
duty,
gives
some
advice
to
the
client,
finds
out
what
the
client
wants
to
do,
and
files
a
notice
of
appeal,
then
things
will
develop
as
they
should
with
counsel
and
an
appeal.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
it's
twofold,
your
honor.
one
is
that
as
a
general
matter
the
standards
on
collateral
attack
are
higher
than
they
are
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
quin
denvir
and
secondly,
there
is
no
right
to
counsel...
mr.
quin
denvir
on
collateral
attack,
so
how
is
this
person...
this
person
has
to
go
out,
develop
an
appellate
record
on
their
own,
do
the
legal
research
on
their
own,
find
the
legal
issues,
file
the
habeas
petition,
and
hope
that
at
that
point
perhaps
they
will
have
counsel
appointed
to
them
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
that's
far
different
than
filing
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
and
having
counsel
appointed
as
a
matter
of
right
to
pursue
that.
i
think...
and
i
think
that's
why
the
court,
it
has
not
yet...
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor...
mr.
quin
denvir
my
understanding
is
that
the
parties
both
agree
that
if
there
is
a
request
by
the
client
for
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
that
in
its...
and
there
is
no
filing,
that
in
itself
meets
any
requirements
under
strickland.
now,
the
only
thing
that's
different
here
is
whether
there
is
some
duty
on
the
part
of
counsel
to
talk
to
the
client
about
an
appeal
and
see
whether
they
want
to
request
an
appeal
or
not.
they
would
say
that
in
a
request
for
an
appeal,
it
is
not
counsel's
duty
to
say,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
honor
that
because
i
don't
think
it's
meritorious.
they
would
have
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
to
start
the
appellate
process
for
whatever
would
come
out
of
it.
mr.
quin
denvir
counsel
may
be
very
wrong,
as
ms.
kops
was
in
this
case,
and...
mr.
quin
denvir
no,
your
honor.
you
know,
what
it
is,
i
think
it
is,
i
think
it's
honoring
the
court's
ruling
that
the
question
whether
to
appeal
is
a
personal
decision
that
is
not
counsel's
to
make,
it
is
the
client's
to
make,
and
it
shouldn't
be
usurped
by
counsel
based
on
that
particular
counsel's
view
of
whether
there
may
be
issues
or
not.
mr.
quin
denvir
not
under
california
law.
almost
invariably
there
is
a
switch
from
trial
counsel
to
appellate
counsel
who
are
experienced
appellate
counsel
under
supervision
from
the
appellate
projects,
as
you
have
heard
in
the
robbins
case.
so
there
is...
there's
a
bar
of
appellate
counsel
that
would
take
this
from
an
appellate
counsel's
view
and
undoubtedly
would
have
found
the
two
issues
that
we've
suggested
under
alford
and
under
harvey.
mr.
quin
denvir
yes,
your
honor,
because...
mr.
quin
denvir
because
i
think
what
you'd
have
to
do...
and
this
is
not
unusual.
this
is
dealt
with
in
federal
courts
all
the
time.
you
would
explain,
this
is
the
situation,
this
is
the
plea
agreement,
you
received
this,
there
are
no
issues,
but
if
the
client
said,
i
want
a
notice
of
appeal
filed,
it
would
be
filed.
that's
required
under
federal
law
now,
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
rules,
so...
and
the...
and
then...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
in
a
hypo
like
that,
in
most
cases,
if
you
have
a
proper
relationship
between
the
client
and
counsel
they
will
abide
by
the
decision,
that
they
will
have
received
what
they
thought
they
were
going
to
receive,
that
they
were
told
by
counsel
they
would
receive,
that
there
were
no
appellate
issues,
and
they
will
not
request
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think,
your
honor,
that
since
it
is
the
client's
decision
under
both
the
federal
rules,
under
jones
v.
barnes,
counsel
has
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
quin
denvir
that
would
be
the
anders
procedure
i...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is.
it...
certainly
the
aba
standard
is
part
of
what
reasonably
competent...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
understand.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor...
your
honor,
the
reason
i
believe
is
that
in
strickland
the
court
stated
that
one
of
the
basic
duties
of
counsel
is
to
provide
consultation
to
the
client
about
important
decisions.
in
jones
v.
barnes,
the
court
said
that
the
decision
whether
to
appeal
or
not
is
a
fundamental
decision
which
cannot
be
decided
by
counsel.
it
is
one
of
the
four
that
can
only
be
decided
by
the
client,
and
we
think
that
follows
from
those
lines
of
cases
that
the
role
of
counsel
is
to
be
assisting
this...
the
client
in
making
the
decision,
because
the
fact
is...
mr.
quin
denvir
no.
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
i...
mr.
quin
denvir
if
appeal
is
available,
then
it
is
not
talking
about
something
that's
a
will-of-the
wisp,
and
the
client
has
a
right
to
pursue
that
appeal.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
the
court
has
said,
though,
that
it
s
not
counsel
to
decide
that,
and
the
defendant
may,
in
that
situation,
want
a
second
opinion.
if
mr.
flores-ortega
got
a
second
opinion...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
of
incompetence
of
counsel,
he
lost
his
direct
appeal
of
right
with
new
counsel
and
two
arguable
issues,
and
an
opportunity
perhaps...
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i...
i'm
not...
i'm
asking
the
court...
the
court
could
have
a
more
limited
rule,
and
i
believe
that
mr.
flores-ortega
comes
within
that
more
limited
rule.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
the
court
has
at
any
point
in
any
of
its
decisions,
rodriquez,
or
penson,
or
evitts,
any
of
those,
required
that
an
unrepresented
defendant
prove
that
there
were
meritorious
issues.
the
court
has
not
done
that
in
any
case
at
all,
and
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
three
justices
last
year
in
pigaro
saying
that
there
would
be
unfair
to
do,
and
the
reason
is
the
practical
reason
that
you
can't
expect
someone
without
counsel
to
play
the
role
of
counsel
to
remedy
the
absence
of
counsel.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
if
there
could
be
a
reliable
determination
based
on
whatever
would
be
before
the
court
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
relief,
then
i
would
agree.
but
i
think
the
problem
you
have
is,
the
question
is,
how
is
that
determined
by
the
court?
the
court
should
only...
mr.
quin
denvir
that
may
be
that
it
should
be,
your
honor.
if
there
is
no
complaint
regarding
the
guilty
plea,
and
there's
no
complaint
regarding
the
sentence,
then...
then
i
don't
know
that
there
would
be
any
showing
of
prejudice
no
matter
what
counsel
was
involved
in
it.
that's
a
very
rare
situation.
in
those
situations,
i
think
you
would
find
that
if
counsel
were
to
advise
the
client
of
the
situation,
there
would
be
a
decision
not
to
appeal,
and
you
wouldn't
have
this
problem.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
there
was
a
statement
which
was
not
required
by
state
law
that...
and
it
was,
you
can
file
an
appeal
60
days
from
today
in
this
court.
it
didn't
say
you
have
the
right
to
appeal.
it
didn't
say
you
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
it
was...
it
didn't
explain
a
lot.
but
in
any
case,
for
someone
in
mr.
flores-ortega's
position,
with
his
education
and
a
spanish-speaking,
he
needed
more
information
than
that.
he...
mr.
quin
denvir
no,
your
honor.
it
was
interpreted.
mr.
quin
denvir
he
speaks
spanish,
and
certified
interpreters
were
used
in
all
the
proceedings.
he
does
not
speak
any
english,
or
writing...
mr.
quin
denvir
there
was...
absolutely.
it
was
translated.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
what
caused
the
loss
of
the
right
to
direct
appeal
was
the
ineffective
assistance
of
defense
counsel,
that
regardless
of
any
advisement
that
was
given
by
the
court,
there
was
a
factual
finding
that
mr.
flores-ortega
did
not
understand
what
an
appeal
was,
therefore
there
was
no
movement
to
exercise
the
decision
to
have
an
appeal.
so
i
think
that,
although
it's
salutary
to
have
that
type
of
advice,
i
don't
think
it's
any
substitute
for
counsel
dealing
with
the
client
in
that
manner,
trying
to
decide...
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
if
it
is
settled
by
a
guilty
plea
with
a
predetermined
sentence,
almost
nobody
appeals.
if
it
is
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
quite
often
there
will
be
loose
ends.
there
will
be
agreement
on
certain
things,
and
other
things
left
open
to
the
court.
quite
often
there
are
appeals
there,
because
there
are...
mr.
quin
denvir
i
don't
think
i
could
give
any
reliable,
but
if
there
is
truly
a
predetermined
sentence,
then
there's
almost
never
an
appeal,
and
if
there
is
not
a
predetermined
sentence,
therefore
there
usually
are
arguable
issues,
then
there
is
an
appeal
and
it's
pursued.
i
think
that's
our
experience
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
which
have
all
that
built
into
it.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
it
has
a
determined
sentencing
law,
which
is
very
complex.
it
wasn't
applicable
in
this
case,
because
the
homicide
murders
have
these
different
indeterminate
sentencing
laws,
but
california
does
have
a
very
complex
one,
with
questions
of
double
sentencing
and
concurrent
and
consecutive
sentencing,
and
it's
a
very
complicated
matter.
it
generates
many
appeals,
much
as
the
sentencing
guidelines
do,
because
of
the
complexity
of
it.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
