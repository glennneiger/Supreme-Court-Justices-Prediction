justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
might
show
us
where
in
the
joint
appendix
that
conversation
occurred,
if
you
would.
or
maybe
you
can
come
back
to
it
and
your
cocounsel
can
try
to
find
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
there
might
be
some
necessity
to
go
back
and
review
them?
i
recognize
that
your
position
is
that
a
per
se
rule
is
not
appropriate,
but
it
is
somewhat
troubling
that
here
the
magistrate
judge
found
that
ortega
wanted
to
appeal,
was
under
the
impression
that
his
lawyer
would
file
an
appeal,
and
was
himself
incarcerated
and
not
able
to
do
it,
and
the
lawyer
testified
that
she
couldn't
remember
her
discussion
about
it
with
the
defendant.
now,
when
you
put
all
those
things
together,
perhaps,
although
you
don't
need
a
per
se
rule,
there
might
be
some
reason
here
to
think
that
an
appeal
should
be
given.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
probation
a
possibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
strickland...
strickland
says
we're
going
to
approach
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
we're
going
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
an
objectively
reasonableness
component
of
the
lawyer's
performance,
and
a
prejudice
component.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
have
applied
some
kind
of
a
per
se
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
to
agree
that
the
ninth
circuit's
per
se
rule
is
invalid,
would
this
case
still
have
to
be
remanded
to
have
the
court
below
consider
the
circumstances
here,
where
the
magistrate
said
that
ortega
wanted
to
appeal
and
thought
the
attorney
was
going
to
file
an
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
enough
that
you
could
characterize
them
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dumont...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
denvir,
in
this
case
it
does
seem
that
the
ninth
circuit
just
didn't
apply
the
strickland
standard
in
judging
this...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seemed
to
craft
some
kind
of
a
per
se
rule
here
of
absolute
consent
or
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
don't
you
think
there's
a
component
on
the
prejudice
side
of
at
least
having
to
have
arguable
grounds
to
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wouldn't
even
mesh
with
anders.
you'd
be
in
an
awful
mess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
that
been
determined...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
case
i
had
assumed
there's
been
no
determination
whether
there
were
arguable
grounds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
pleaded
guilty
to
murder.
at
sentencing,
the
trial
judge
told
him
he
had
60-days
in
which
to
file
notice
of
appeal.
no
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
within
the
60-days.
about
four
months
after
the
sentencing,
the
respondent
tried
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
but
it
was
rejected
as
untimely.
after
exhausting
his
state
remedies,
the
respondent
filed
a
federal
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
alleging
constitutionally
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
based
on
the
counsel's
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
district
court
denied
relief.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal
reversed,
finding
that
the
respondent
was
entitled
a
relief
because
under
its
precedent,
a
habeas
petitioner
need
only
show
that
the
counsel’s
failure
to
appeal
was
without
the
client’s
consent.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
this
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
our
case
of
strickland
versus
washington
provides
the
proper
framework
for
evaluating
a
claim,
that
counsel
was
constitutionally
ineffective
for
failing
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
defendant
must
show
that
counsel’s
performance
was
objectively
unreasonable.
it
is
well
settled
that
counsel
performs
deficiently
by
disregarding
a
defendant’s
specific
instructions
either
to
file
or
not
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
does
not
instruct
counsel
about
filing
an
appeal,
the
relevant
question
is
whether
counsel's
failure
to
consult
with
the
defendant
about
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
taking
an
appeal
and
to
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
find
out
the
defendant’s
wishes,
whether
that
was
at
self
deficient.
the
better
practice,
of
course,
is
for
counsel
routinely
to
consult
with
the
defendant
regarding
the
possibility
and
advisability
of
appealing.
we
cannot
say
however,
as
a
constitutional
matter
that
in
every
case,
counsel’s
failure
to
consult
is
necessarily
unreasonable
and
therefore
deficient;
instead,
we
hold
that
counsel
has
a
constitutionally
imposed
duty
to
consult
with
the
defendant
about
an
appeal,
when
either
a
rational
defendant
would
want
to
appeal
for
example
because
there
are
nonfrivolous
grounds
for
appeal,
or
that
this
particular
defendant
demonstrated
to
counsel
that
he
wanted
an
appeal.
now
the
second
part,
if
counsel’s
performance
is
deficient
under
that
standard,
the
second
part
of
the
strickland
test
asks
whether
the
defendant
can
show
prejudice
from
the
failure
of
counsel
to
file
the
appeal,
and
in
that
regard,
we
hold
that
the
defendant
has
to
demonstrate
a
reasonable
probability
that
but
for
the
counsel's
defendant
failure
to
consult
with
him
about
an
appeal,
that
he
would
have
filed
a
timely
appeal.
now
the
question
whether
the
defendant
has
made
the
requisite
showing,
will
turn
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case;
and
evidence
that
there
were
nonfrivolous
grounds
for
appeal,
or
that
the
defendant
promptly
told
the
lawyer
of
his
wish
to
appeal
will
be
relevant.
now
the
court
below,
undertook
neither
part
of
that
strickland
inquiry
that
we
have
described,
and
the
findings
we
have
before
us
don’t
provide
us
with
enough
information
to
determine
whether
the
attorney
here
rendered
constitutionally
ineffective
assistance.
accordingly,
we
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined,
and
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
