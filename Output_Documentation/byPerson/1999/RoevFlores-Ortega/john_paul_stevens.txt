justice
john
paul
stevens
was
parole
an
option?
i
can't...
i'm
not
sure
of
your
answer
to
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
is
it
not
conceivable...
well,
i
don't
know,
that
the
defendant
thought,
oh
yes,
if
he
sentences
me
it
will
be
15
years,
but
i
at
least
have
a
long
shot
at
probation?
isn't
that
conceivable?
i
mean,
would
this
case
be
different,
say,
if
they
didn't...
if
this
wasn't...
say
the
sentence
could
have
been
anywhere
from
1
year
to
life,
and
he
ends
up
getting
a
20-year
sentence,
which
was
a
lot
more
than
he
expected,
the...
you'd
make
the
same
arguments
i
think,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you,
or
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
the
same
ambiguity
about
advice,
and
whether
he
really
wanted
to
appeal
and
all
that
stuff
is
the
same.
the
only
difference
would
be,
maybe
he
had
some
shot
at
relief
on
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
sort
of
basic
question
on
that
point?
do
you
think
the
rule
should
be
different
after
a
trial
and
conviction
on
the
one
hand
and
after
a
guilty
plea,
then
an
interval,
and
then
sentencing
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
with
one
quick...
why
don't
you
make
the
same
presumption
after
a
trial?
you
presume
competency
of
counsel
in
all
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
want
to
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me.
