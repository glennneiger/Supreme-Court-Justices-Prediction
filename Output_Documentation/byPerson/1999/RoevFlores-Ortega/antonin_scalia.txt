justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
maybe
speak
up
or
put
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
crank
up
the
thing.
no,
you're
cranking...
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
you
want
me
to
know
what
you
were
saying
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
reading
from
the
transcript
or
the
joint
appendix?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
go
earlier
in
the
questioning?
so
has
anybody
made
any
promises
to
you
beyond
what
i
have
just
said,
namely
that
counts
2
and
3
will
be
dismissed,
and
there
would
be
just
the
one
count.
has
anybody
made
any
other
promises?
and
the
defendant
says,
promise?
in
other
words,
the
district
attorney
has
promised
if
you
plead
guilty
she's
going
to
dismiss
the
other
counts
and
the
knife
enhancement.
were
any
other
promises
made
to
you?
the
defendant:
no
all
right.
can
you
tell
me
what
the
term
is
for
second
degree
murder?
and
he
says
he
understands
that
it's
15
years
to
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
put
all
that
together,
it
seems
to
me
he
understands
he's
going
to
get
15
years
to
life,
and
has
been
promised
nothing
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
life
was
the
outer
limit,
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
contend
that
there's
no
arguable
basis
for
appeal
here,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
of
this,
we're
talking
about
some
other
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
there
is
no
arguable
grounds
for
appeal,
what
would
he
advise
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
advise
the
defendant
there
are
no
grounds
for
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
this
case...
and
if
the
defendant
said
appeal
anyway,
he
would
say,
i
can't
appeal,
there
are...
you
know,
there
are
no
grounds...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
open
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
he
agreed
to
was
that
he
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
second
degree
murder,
which
contained
a
punishment
of
15
years
to
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
your
position,
then,
you
would
say
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
that
if
there
are
no
arguable
grounds
for
appeal,
as
you
say
there
is
not
here...
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
he
got
30
years,
instead
of
15
years,
there
would
be
no
requirement
for
the
attorney
to
file
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
case
is
made
easy
by
the
fact
that
he
got
the
lowest
that
was
available
for
that
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
he
had
gotten
30
years,
would
you
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
there
is
no
arguable
issue
to
appeal,
there
is
no
need
to
advise.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
require...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
7-1/2
that
he
said
before.
did
he
say
5-1/2?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
not
promised
probation
though,
we
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
chance...
is
there
any
chance
on
earth
that
he
could
have
successfully
appealed,
claiming
that
it
was
error
not
to
give
him
probation?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
answer
that
arguable
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it
was
conceivable
that
for
a
conviction
of
second
degree
murder,
where
he
got
the
minimum
term,
15
years,
he
could
have
taken
an
appeal
and
said,
you
know,
it
was
error
not
to
let
me
go
walking
off
on
probation
for
a
second
degree
murder
that
i
have
confessed
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
the
facts
justifying
the
plea
to
second
degree
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
the
facts
justifying
the
plea
to
second
degree
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
on
those
facts...
and
had
intentionally
done
so,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
on
those
facts
you
think
it
was
conceivable
that
when
the
trial
court
decided
not
to
give
him
probation,
that
trial
judge
would
be
reversed
on
appeal
for
not
having
given
probation?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
conceivable...
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you're
saying
there
were
arguable
grounds
for
appeal,
but
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
decision
below
was
made,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
or
not
there
were
arguable
grounds
of
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
not
address
the
arguable
grounds...
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
hear
you
justify
that,
instead
of
talking
about
the
arguable
grounds...
justice
antonin
scalia
what
difference
does
it
make...
what
difference
does
it
make
if
there
are
no
arguable
grounds
of
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
retrospect,
looking
back,
were
there
any
arguable
grounds
of
appeal?
answer,
no.
why
should
it
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
he
say
no
to
an
appeal?
i
mean,
you
know,
counsel
tells
him,
you
know,
there
are
really
no
grounds
to
appeal.
you're
going
to
lose.
you
want
to
appeal?
this
is
free
counsel.
this
is
being
giving
to
him.
why
should
he
possibly...
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
rule
that
you're
proposing.
why
wouldn't
it
produce
frivolous
appeals...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
alford
briefs
endlessly?
justice
antonin
scalia
hope
does
not
spring
eternal,
even
when
the
appeal
is
free,
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
because
there's
a
quid
pro
quo.
you
don't
get
the
plea
agreement
unless...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
forego
the
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
talking
about
a
client
who
hasn't
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
he
take
the
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lawyer
tells
him,
there's
no
basis
for
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
assuming...
you've
got
to
take
the
hypothesis
we're
giving
you.
we're
assuming
that
there's
no
basis
for
an
appeal,
that
there
isn't
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
still...
right.
you're...
it's
like
somebody
suing
somebody
for
not
giving
them
a
losing
lottery
ticket.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
he
was
deprived
of
an
appeal,
but
it
was
worthless.
the
appeal
was
worthless.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
way
we're
doing
it
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
way
we're
doing
it
now.
after
the
fact,
we're
looking
back.
we
don't
need
counsel.
we
have
better
than
counsel.
we
have
judges
looking
at
it,...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
judges
determined
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
appeal,
but
you
say,
even
though,
you
know,
the
best
judges
in
the
land
look
at
it
and
say
there's
no
reasonable
basis
for
an
appeal,
nonetheless
it
was
incompetent
counsel
for
not
taking
this
useless
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
penson
was...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that
so?
he
can
raise
it
later
on
habeas,
as
it's
been
raised
later
on
habeas
here,
and
then
you
can
get
good
counsel
and
scratch
up
some
arguable
issues,
and
if
he
finds
arguable
issues,
then
you
go
back
and
look
at
it
and
you
say,
yes,
indeed,
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
file
frivolous
notices
of
appeal,
and
then
appellant
counsel
has
to
file
anders
briefs
in
these
frivolous
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
can
do
that,
even
though
counsel
believes
that
there's
no
basis
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
this
called
a...
what,
an
anders
notice
of
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
decisions
within
the
realm
of
the
possible.
the
lawyer
doesn't
have
to
advise
him
about
how
he
can
levitate
himself
out
of
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
appeal
is
not
available,
if
there's
nothing
to
be
gained
from
it,
counsel
doesn't
have
to
advise
about
that
utterly
impractical,
never-will-happen...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
isn't
whether
appeal
is
available.
the
issue
is
whether
relief
is
available.
if
no
relief
is
available,
there's
nothing
to
be
gained.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
well
be,
and
we're
looking
back.
maybe
counsel
should
have
told
him.
the
fact
is,
has
there
been
any
harm
done?
has
there
been
incompetence
of
counsel
in
failing
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
leave
that
out
of
the
case,
because
that's
not
the
rule
that
you're
asking
us
to
adopt.
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule
that
applies
whether
there
are
arguable
issues
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
speak
english?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
speak
any,
but
the
court's
statement
to
him
was
translated
to
him,
you
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
