mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
imposed
on
the
state
the
per
se
rule
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
where
an
attorney
declines
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
and
does
not
obtain
a
waiver
of
appeal...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
okay.
shall
i
start
over?
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
all
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
imposed
on
the
state
a
per
se
rule
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
where
an
attorney
declines
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
and
does
not
obtain
a
waiver
of
appeal
rights.
this
rule
applies
even
where
a
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty,
there
has
been
no
request
for
an
appeal
despite
an
appeal
rights
advisement,
and
there
are
no
grounds
for
an
appeal.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
an
arguable
issue,
because
the
defendant
was
advised
on
the
record
at
the
plea
hearing
that
he
would
receive
a
sentence
of
15
years
to
life.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
in
addition,
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit's
rule...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
thank
you.
in
addition,
affirmance
would
lead
to
habeas
litigation
concerning
defaulted
meritless
post
plea
appeals.
in
those
rare
cases
where
relief
is
granted,
relitigation
of
the
case
would
be
difficult
because
of
the
passage
of
time.
the
ninth
circuit
rule
is
simply
wrong.
there
is
nothing
presumptively
ineffective
about
not
filing
an
appeal
after
a
guilty
plea.
there
are
few
grounds
for
challenging
the
plea
and
the
resulting
sentence.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that,
because
there
was
no
request
for
an
appeal,
and
because
there
were
no
grounds
for
appeal
that
a
reasonable
attorney
would
have
pursued,
that
there
was
no
duty
under
the
first
prong
of
strickland
to
file
an
appeal.
also,
i
found
that
portion
of
the
transcript
where
the
defendant
was
advised
of
the
sentence.
it's
at...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
it's
the
joint
appendix.
it's
page
25
of
the
joint
appendix.
it's
the
end
of
page
12
of
the
transcripts.
the
court
states,
and
do
you
understand
that
the
term
for
second
degree
murder
is
15
years
to
life?
the
defendant
responds,
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
the
court
asks
again,
do
you
understand
that?
the
defendant
repeats,
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
a
possibility,
but
under
the
california
rules
of
court
probation
was
only
permissible
under
unusual
circumstances,
and
defense
counsel
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
a
claim
that
the
court
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
probation
would
almost
certainly
fail.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
understanding
was
that
he
would
receive
a
15-year
term
and
that
the
possibility
of
probation
was
highly
unlikely.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
actually
his
argument
is
that
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
3-1/2
years,
and
there
is
simply
no
support
for
that.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
i
think
he
did
understand
that
he
was
going
to
get
15
years.
there
was
the
portion
of
the
transcript,
the
guilty
plea
transcript
we
just
referred
to.
also,
the
probation
officer
stated
in
the
probation
report
that
he
would
get
15
years
to
life.
the
defense
attorney
went
over
the
probation
report
with
him
the
day
before
sentencing,
and
then
when
he
was
sentenced
to
15
years
to
life
he
expressed
no
surprise
at
that.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
if
there
are
circumstances
indicating
the
defendant
might
benefit
from
an
appeal,
or
advice
concerning
an
appeal...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor,
counsel
has
a
duty
under
the
first
prong
of
strickland
to
advise
concerning
appeal
rights,
even
after
a
guilty
plea,
if
there
are
circumstances
indicating
the
defendant
might
benefit
from
such
advice.
in
other
words,
there
are
grounds...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
even
if
there
are
arguable
grounds
for
appeal...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor.
there
would
be
a
duty
to
advise...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
there
would
be
a
duty
to
advise
of
appeal
rights,
because
there
are
arguable
grounds
for
appeal,
but
there
would
be
no
duty
to
file
the
appeal.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
there
would
be
a
duty
to
advise
the
defendant.
there
would
not
be
a
duty
to
obtain
a
waiver
of
appeal
rights.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
an
anders
brief?
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
no,
your
honor.
we're
still
at
trial.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
that...
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
in
the
hypothetical
posed...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
following
a
guilty
plea...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
yes,
your
honor.
the
attorney
would...
if
the
client
wanted
to
appeal,
and
the
attorney
felt
the
grounds
were
frivolous,
the
attorney
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
file
the
appeal,
although
the
attorney
would
assist
the
defendant
in
filing
his
own
appeal.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
again,
the
anders
obligation
is
actually
an
obligation
of
appellate
counsel,
to
file
an
anders
brief.
it's...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
if
there
are
arguable
grounds
for
appeal,
the
trial
lawyer
would
have
a
duty
to
advise
of
appeal
rights,
but
the
lawyer
would
not
have
a
duty
to
actually
file
the
appeal
unless
there
was
either
a
request
for
an
appeal,
nonfrivolous
appeal,
or
there
were
grounds
on
which
any
reasonable
attorney
would
pursue
an
appeal.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
after
a
guilty
plea,
generally
speaking,
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor.
in
a
trial
situation
it
can
usually
be
assumed
that
the
defendant
does
want
to
continue
the
litigation.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
sentencing
issues
are
usually
addressed
in
a
plea
negotiations,
so
there
usually
are
not...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
issue
of
sentencing
is
left
completely
open...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
no,
your
honor.
the
defendant
understood
that
he
would
receive
a
sentence
of
15
years
to
life.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
a
sentence
of
15
years
to
life
is
the
only
sentence
for
second
degree
murder...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
probation.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
an
option,
but
under
the
california
rules
of
the
court
it
could
only
be
granted
in
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
if
the
sentence
was
much
more
severe
than
what
the
defendant...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
expected?
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
if
he
has
arguable
grounds
for
an
appeal,
then
there
would
be
a
duty
to
advise
of
appeal
rights,
but...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
an
appeal...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
again,
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
defendant
got
the
only
term
he
could
have
gotten
for
second
degree
murder.
if
there's
an
arguable
issue
for
appeal,
then
an
attorney
has
a
duty
to
advise
of
those
appeal
rights.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
no
duty
to
advise.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
first,
with
regard
to
the
harvey
issue,
harvey
is
a
california
case
which
states
that
a
sentencing
court
cannot
rely
on
facts
which
are
related
solely
to
accounts
dismissed
pursuant
to
a
plea
bargain.
however,
in
this
case,
the
sentencing
court
relied
on
facts
that
were
related
to
the
murder.
for
example,
it
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
respondent
was
armed
and
the
victim
was
not,
and
that's
at
j.a.
40,
at
joint
appendix,
page
40.
also,
with
respect
to
the
harvey
issue,
opposing
counsel
mentioned
that
the
prosecutor
used...
factually
went
into
the
dismissed
counts.
even
assuming
this
is
correct,
it
is
irrelevant,
because
the
harvey
standard
pertains
to
the
trial
court's
actions
and,
again,
the
trial
court
didn't
rely
on
any
facts
solely
related
to
the
dismissed
counts.
with
respect
to
the
alford
issue,
i'd
like
to
make
two
points.
first
of
all,
alford
involved
factual
innocence.
the
defendant
claimed
he
didn't
shoot
anyone.
this
is
not
the
same
claim
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
mr.
ortega
made
the
claim
in
his
california
supreme
court
petition
that
he
was
only
guilty
of
manslaughter.
well
then,
manslaughter
theory
should
have
been
pursued.
also,
opposing
counsel
stated
that
a
judge
taking
the
plea
under
alford
must
resolve
the
conflict
between
the
guilty
plea
and
the
claim
of
innocence.
actually,
the
trial
judge
did
this
in
effect
because
the
defense
attorney
stated
why
the
guilty
plea
was
being
entered
despite
the
claim
of
innocence.
this
is
at
j.a.
26-27,
pages
26-27
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
court
asked,
so,
counsel,
i
understand
that
this
plea
is
made
under
people
v.
west,
which
is
california's
analogue
to
alford.
is
that
correct?
defense
attorney,
that
is
correct,
and
i
did
write
on
the
form,
the
change
of
plea
form,
and
i
went
over
with
mr.
flores
this
morning
numerous
times
the
explanation
that
was
given
for
his
change
of
plea,
and
that
is
that
if
he
goes
to
trial
there
was
the
risk
that
he
could
be
found
guilty
of
crimes
for
which
he
could
receive
more
severe
sentences,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
mr.
flores
is
pleading
guilty.
so
there's
the
explanation
for
why
the
defendant
entered
his
plea
despite
his
claims
of
innocence.
he
wanted
to
avoid
a
more
severe
sentence,
and
alford
allows
that.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
your
honor,
there's
an
obligation
under
only
two
circumstances.
first,
where
the
defendant
inquires
about
appeal
rights,
and
then
secondly
where
there
are
circumstances
indicating
the
defendant
may
benefit
from
such
advice.
in
other
words,
there
are...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
no.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
no,
your
honor.
in
that
circumstance
the
question
would
be,
are
there
circumstances
indicating
the
defendant
could
benefit
from
appeal
advice,
and
that
question
boils
down
to
the
issue
of
whether
there
were
grounds,
or
more
specifically
arguable
grounds
for
appeal.
so
in
this
case,
there
were
no
arguable
grounds
for
appeal,
so
counsel
had
no
duty
to
advise
of
appeal
rights.
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
yes,
that's...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
in
part
we're
relying
on
a
ninth
circuit
case
called
marrow,
which
we
cited
in
our
briefs,
and
a
number
of
other...
mr.
paul
e.
o'connor
well,
that's
simply
the
warden's
position,
that
there
are
no
arguable
grounds.
