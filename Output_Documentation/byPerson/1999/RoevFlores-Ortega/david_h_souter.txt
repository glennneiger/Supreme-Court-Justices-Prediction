justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
shouldn't
you
also
add
to
your
statement
of
fact
that
there
has
in
fact
been,
i
guess
in
this
case,
a
naked
plea,
and
the
defendant's
claim
is
that
the
defendant
had
been
led
to
expect
a
sentence
perhaps
as
low
as
3-1/2
and
instead
got
a
sentence
of
15,
so
that
there's
a...
at
least
is
a
potential
claim
that
the
sentence
is
too
high,
or
in
relation
the
defendant's
expectations
the
plea
would
not
have
been
entered
under
those
circumstances
had
the
defendant
anticipated
the
sentence.
isn't
that
also
something
we
should
consider?
justice
david
h.
souter
before
the
plea
was
entered?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
i
misunderstood
this.
so
this,
then,
is
a
case,
i
guess
exactly
like
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
has
a
plea
agreement
and
the
plea
agreement
is
meticulously
followed
by
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
understand
that
to
mean
that
he's
going
to
get
15
years.
i
guess
it's...
looks
to
me
as
though
he
understands
that
a
potential
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the...
there
at
least
was
a
claim,
there
was
an
argument,
i
guess,
that
there
should
have
been
probation.
if
there
was
an
argument
that
there
should
have
been
probation,
that
flies
in
the
face
of
your
suggestion
that
there
was
an
understanding
that
he
was
going
to
get
a
15-year
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you...
what
you
get
is
probably
a
clearly
losing
claim
on
appeal,
but
his
argument
is,
i
would
like
to
have...
i
think
his
argument
is,
i
would
like
to
have
appealed
because
the
sentence
was
too
long.
i
didn't
have
to
get
15
years.
that
was
simply
the
outer
limit.
and
he
may
very
well...
in
front
of
me,
i
guess,
he
would
certainly
lose
his
argument
there,
but
what
he
wants...
justice
david
h.
souter
what
he
wants
is
to
make
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
he
thought...
maybe
there
was
no
support
for
it,
but
you
don't
take
this
statement
as
an
indication
that
he
was
agreeing
that
he
would
get
15
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
think
we
may
just
disagree
on
what
the
record
shows,
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
predetermined
term
in
the...
as
a
part
of
the
plea
agreement.
the
defendant
ends
up
getting
a
longer
sentence
than
he
wanted
to
get,
a
longer
sentence
than
he
thought
he
would
get,
and
he
wants
to
argue
that,
in
fact,
that
sentence
is,
for
whatever
reason,
improperly
wrong,
that
it
was
error,
and
reversible
error
to
sentence
him
to
that
long
a
sentence.
and
let's
assume,
finally,
that
that
kind
of
a
claim
is
highly
unlikely
to
succeed,
maybe
because
he's
just
being
unreasonable.
in
that
case,
do
you
believe
that
there
is
no
obligation,
following
the
guilty
plea,
for
counsel
to
counsel
him
about
appeal
and
get
an
affirmative
decision
from
him
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
take
my
hypothetical.
he
doesn't
like
it,
but
we
all
know
that
he's
going
to
lose
if
he
makes
that
argument.
it's
highly
unlikely
that
that
will
be
a
successful
appeal.
does
counsel
have
an
obligation
under
the
strickland
standard
to
counsel
him
that
he
has
appeal
rights
and
to
get
a
yes
or
no
answer
from
him
as
to
whether
he
wants
an
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
my
case
the
circumstances,
the
defendant
probably
isn't
going
to
benefit.
he's
going
to
lose
the
appeal.
does...
is
there
a
strickland
obligation
to
counsel
him
and
get
a
decision
on
my
hypothetical?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
can
answer
the
question,
yes
or
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
a
duty
to
get
a
decision
from
the
defendant,
yes
or
no,
as
to
whether
he
wants
the
appeal
filed?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
obligation
to
file
an
afred
brief
in
a
case
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
anders
brief,
rather.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it's
the
guilty
plea
that
relieves
him
of
the
anders
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
guess
the
lawyer
at
that
point
could
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
withdraw
and
ask
the
court
to
appoint
different
appellate
counsel,
if
it
would,
but
until
the
lawyer
does
withdraw,
i
suppose
the
lawyer
has
got
the
obligation
under
anders,
doesn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
the
defendant
simply
sits
mute
and
doesn't
say,
i
want
you
to
appeal,
or
i
don't
want
you
to
appeal,
the
obligation
is
over
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
after
a
trial?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
if
the
issue
following
the
plea,
if
the
issue
upon
which
the
defendant
may
want
to
appeal
is
the
sentence,
so
that
the...
and
the
sentence
is
not
foreclosed
by
the
guilty
plea,
why
isn't
the
obligation,
at
least
with
respect
to
an
appeal
of
sentence,
the
same
following
a
plea
as
the
obligation
with
respect
to
any
issue
following
a
verdict?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we've
got
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
plea
agreement
about
what
the
sentence
will
be,
and
the
sentence
may
be
higher
than
the
defendant
thinks
is
proper,
so
that
the
defendant
would
like
to
appeal
it,
why
isn't
the
defendant
in
the
same
relationship
to
his
counsel
with
respect
to
the
sentence
that
any
defendant
is
in
relationship
to
counsel
following
a
verdict
and
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
let's
assume
we...
there's
no
plea
agreement,
i
take
it,
in
the
record
or
anywhere
else,
to
the
effect
that
he
was
agreeing
in
advance
to
a
15-year
sentence,
was
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
why
there
is
no
sentencing
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
in
fact
what
he
got,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
his
sentence,
what
he
was
describing
in
the
transcript
as
you
read
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
clear
from
the
transcript,
and
it
may
be
that
i
wasn't
listening
carefully
when
you
first
started
it,
but
is
it
clear
from
the
transcript
that
he
was
saying
that
she
advised
him
that
he
would
get
a
15-year
term
which
would
be
subject
to
the
good
time
credits,
or
that
she
was
advising
him
that
if
he
got
a
15-year
term
it
would
be
subject
to
the
good
time
credits?
is
it
clear
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
argument,
i
take
it,
is
we're
not
clear,
the
transcript
is
not
clear
on
that,
but
on
the
assumption
that
counsel
was
competent,
that's
what
she
would
have
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
reconstruction
of
what
presumably
went
on
is
perhaps
what
he
would
like
to
test
out
on
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
let's
assume
that's...
that
part
is
waived.
he...
if
the
plea
is
a
valid
plea,
that
issue
was
waived,
and
the
only
thing
that's
left
is
sentence,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
argument
that
you've
just
made
there
is
a
very
plausible
basis
for
saying
that
if
he
had
taken
an
appeal
on
that
issue,
he
would
have
lost,
clearly.
on
the
other
hand,
we
at
least
in
the
anders
situation
require
counsel
to
address
the
issue,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
your
position
squares
with
anders.
can
you
help
me
out
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
make
an
anders
lawyer
do
what
anders
says
the
lawyer
must
do,
it
would
be
strange
if
there
were
somehow
a
short-circuit
to
the
process
as
you
are
arguing.
i
mean,
it
just
seems
odd
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
in
effect
you
can't
have
a
rule
that
says
as
a
matter
of
law
competent
counsel
must
instruct
on
the
appeal
issue
and
get
a...
an
affirmative
or
a
negative
response
one
way
or
the
other.
you're
saying
that
that
is
an
improper
gloss
on
strickland.
justice
david
h.
souter
say
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you
also
have,
if
i
understood
what
you
were
saying
earlier,
you
have
a
separate
answer
to
that,
and
that
is,
if
you
don't
in
effect
require
or
impose
kind
of
a
per
se
obligation
on
counsel,
at
least
to
give
counsel
and
to
get
a
decision,
then,
in
fact,
the
only
way
the
meritorious
claim
is
ever
going
to
come
to
light
is
on
habeas.
there's
no
right
to
have
habeas
counsel,
and
you'll
simply
never
find
the
meritorious
cases.
am
i
characterizing
your
point
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
you
don't
do
it
this
way,
in
effect
the
meritorious
cases
are
probably
not
going
to
come
to
light.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
your
position
be
in
a
case
in
which,
number
1,
as
here,
there
is
a
guilty
plea,
and
number
2,
there
was
a
plea
agreement
definite
as
to
sentence
and
that
agreement
was
honored?
would
you
say
that
there
was
still
an
obligation
to...
for
counsel
to
consult
with
the
client
and
get
an
affirm...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
a
case
like
that,
i
presume
the
hypo
is
such
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
could
be
no
relief...
there
could
be
no
prejudice
because
there
could
be
no
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
sure
that's
so,
but
you...
despite
the
fact
that
on
the
hypo
there
is,
i
guess
we
could
say
as
a
matter
of
law
there
would
be
no
relief,
you
would
still
require
the
affirmative
act
of
counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
taking
you
beyond
strickland.
i
mean,
your
argument
in
this
case
is,
we're
not
really
going
beyond
strickland,
because
the
only
way
in
effect
to
identify
the
meritorious
strickland
cases
is
to
put
a
gloss
on
the
strickland
reasonable
competence
standard
by
saying,
counsel
has
got
to
do
this
much
as
least.
but
now,
in
answer
to
my
hypo,
i
think
you're
going
beyond
strickland,
because
i
think
you're
saying
that
even
when
therein,
as
a
matter
of
law
could
be
no
ultimate
prejudice,
they've
still
got
to
do
it,
and
so
that's
not
strickland.
that
seems
to
me
a
new
sixth
amendment
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
rule
goes
beyond
strickland.
you
agree,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
does
it...
why
does
it
not
go
beyond
strickland,
at
least
on
the
prejudice
prong?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
understand
your
argument
in
a
case
in
which
at
least
it
is
conceivable...
strike
the
word
conceivable.
i
can
understand
your
argument
in
any
case
in
which
you
don't
start
with
the
hypothesis
that
at
the
end
of
the
road
there
can
be
no
relief,
and
the
reason
i
accept
your
argument
there,
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
is
that
there's
a
problem
of
administrability,
and
it's
far
better
simply
to
let's
have
the
appeal
and
find
out
than
be
speculating
in
fact
about
very,
very
difficult
cases.
but
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you,
i
at
least
was
calculating
my
hypothesis
in
such
a
way
that
at
the
end
of
the
road
there
could
be
no
possible
relief.
he
had
pleaded
guilty,
he
got
exactly
what
the
plea
agreement
called
for,
so
i
could
conceive
of
no
situation
in
which
he
could
get
relief.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
does
go
beyond
strickland.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
sound
to
determine
it
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothesis?
if
the
guilty
plea
is
assumed
to
be
a
voluntary
plea,
so
you're
not
attacking
the
plea
itself
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
and
the
plea
agreement
has
been
honored
in
every
jot
and
tiddle,
he
got
exactly
what
he
agreed
upon,
why
isn't
that
a
case
that
should
be
accepted
from
the
rule
that
you
want
us
to
apply
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
he
does
speak
spanish?
