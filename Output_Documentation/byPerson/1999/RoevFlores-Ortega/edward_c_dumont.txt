mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
situation
we
have
here
arises
when
you
have
a
counseled
defendant
who
has
pleaded
guilty,
has
been
given
notice
of
the
right
to
appeal,
and
arrives
later
on
habeas
claiming
that
ineffective
assistance,
incompetent
advice
from
counsel
led
to
the
forfeiture
of
the
right
to
a
direct
appeal.
now,
that
poses
a
risk
both
of
a
serious
constitutional
deprivation,
and
a
serious
risk
of
abuse,
because
it
comes
after
a
time
when
all
of
these
issues
should
initially
be
raised,
and
when
there's
some
reliance
interest
from
the
state
on
the
fact
that
no
appeal
was
filed,
and
the
challenge
is
to
craft
a
rule
that
minimizes
the
risk
both
of
the
deprivation
and
of
the
abuse
without
unduly
burdening
the
district
courts,
and
we
think
the
court's
cases
provide
a
familiar
model
for
that,
which
is
simply
the
strickland
analysis.
strickland
teaches
that
there
is
a
strong
presumption
of
competent
assistance...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
really
is
to,
in
this
context,
revert
to
what
we
would
characterize
as
a
knowing
waiver
or
a
deliberate
bypass
standard,
and
we
think
that's
right,
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
strickland.
they
have
completely
eliminated
the
prejudice
and
even,
really,
the
competence
prongs
of
strickland,
so
it's
an
entirely
unrecognizable
rule.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
all
the
magistrate
said...
the
magistrate's
findings
are
very
ambiguous,
and
a...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
a
remand
would
not
be
necessarily
inappropriate
once
the
court
articulates
the
rule.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
here,
because
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole,
as
the
district
court
ought
to
do,
on
an
ineffective
assistance
challenge,
what
you
would
find
is
that
there
is,
a),
no
reason
to
think
that
counsel
was
incompetent
in
counseling
about
appeal,
and
2)
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
defendant
would...
there's
no
reasonable
probability
or
significant
possibility
that
the...
that
a
competently
counseled
defendant
would
have
chosen
to
appeal
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
the
rule...
the
test
is
the
same,
but
the
result
may
very
well
be
different
in
many
of
the
cases,
and
that's
because
it's
a
facts
and
circumstances
test,
and
the
circumstance
of
a
guilty
plea
is
tremendously
important,
and
that's
for
two
reasons,
really.
the
first
is
that
there's
very
little
left
to
appeal,
normally,
after
a
guilty
plea,
although
there's
sentencing
issues,
of
course,
at
least
in
the
federal
system.
and
the
second
one...
and
the
second
issue...
there's
no...
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
this.
there's
really
no
sentencing
issue
here,
i
think.
but
the
second
reason
is
that
because...
the
presumption
is
that
there
is
competent
counsel,
and
the
presumption
is
that
there
will
have
been
competent
counsel
on
the
guilty
plea
as
well
as
on
this
issue
of
appeal,
and
it
gets
right
to
this
question
that
you
were
discussing
with
my
colleague.
if
you
assume
competent
counsel
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
to
plead
guilty,
then
you
would
assume
that
the
lawyer
had
discussed
with
the
client
what
the
parameters
of
sentencing
were
going
to
be
if
he
pled
to
second
degree
murder.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right.
it's
simply
that
the
record
is
much
more
likely
to,
considered
as
a
whole...
there
are
two
things.
first
of
all,
the
record
is
more
likely
to
reveal
issues
that
are
worthy
of
appeal
and,
second,
there
is
more
reason
to
assume
that
the
defendant
was
intent
on
fighting
the
conviction,
was
perhaps
maintaining
his
innocence,
and
would
have
wanted
to
appeal.
both
of
those
change
significantly
in
the
guilty
plea
context.
now,
if
i
can
just
point
out
that
on
this
issue
of
the
3-1/2
years,
which
i
agree,
if
you
look
through...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
if
you
look
through
the
record
here...
well,
on
the
issue
of
the
3-1/2
years,
that
is
an
allegation
that's
made
in
some
of
the
earlier
habeas
filings
in
the
state
system.
it's
not
made,
incidentally,
here
except
by
way
of
a
factual
statement.
i
think
that's
only...
the
3-1/2
years
only
comes
up
in
the
written
papers,
which
there's
some
reason
to
wonder
whether
this
defendant
was
personally
responsible
for
them,
because
he
had
assistance
and
he
was
in
the
prison
when
filing
them.
when
he
was
testifying
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
proceeding,
what
he
said
was...
and
this
is
at
page
26
of
the
transcript
of
the
evidentiary
hearing.
i'm
afraid
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
but
what
he
said
was,
well,
she...
meaning
his
attorney...
all
she
told
me
was
to
go
the
jail
trusting
her,
that
of
the
15
years
i
would
only
do
7-1/2,
and
that
i
would
get
to
work
at
the
jail,
i
would
receive
payment,
and
so
on.
now,
significant
to
that,
actually,
is
that
as
i
understand
it
good
time
credits,
which
do
come
off
the
15-year
minimum,
could,
in
fact,
in
california
have
taken
him
down
to
7-1/2,
and
that
would
suggest
that
what
he
got
was
competent
counseling
about
the
likely,
both
legal
and
practical
effects
of
the
sentence.
now,
the
legal
effect
is
that
there's
only
one
sentence...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
my...
my
understanding...
i
can't
represent
that
firmly,
but
my
understanding
from
my
colleagues
from
california
is
that
that
is
realistic,
that
from
a
15-year
minimum,
under
the
statutory
indeterminate
sentencing
scheme,
with
good
time
you
could
be
eligible
for
release
by
the
board
of
prison
terms
as
early
as
7-1/2
years.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
if
there
was
any
kind
of
competent
advice
at
all,
the
advice
would
have
had
to
be,
the
term
will
be
15
years
to
life,
because
that
is
the
only
term
authorized
by
statute.
it
is
an
indeterminate
sentencing
scheme
in
california.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
and
that
there
wouldn't
be
anything
to
appeal
anyway...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
because
there's
no
other
possible
result.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think...
if
you
look
through
the
record...
this
is
what
i
was
starting
to
say
before.
if
you
look
through
the
record
and
come
through
it
the
way
a
lawyer
might,
i
think
it
is
true
you
would
come
up
with
a
couple
of
things.
one
is
that
issue,
and
one
is
the
issue
he
raised
before
the
california
supreme
court,
which
was,
my
attorney
should
have
taken
me
to
trial
and
tried
to
get
manslaughter
instead
of
second
degree
murder,
it
was
a
fight,
and
this
kind
of
thing.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
all
the
anders
cases,
enhancements
on
all
the
anders
cases
are
cases
where
we
are
already
passed
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
or
we
are
into
the
appeal
process,
and
so
there's
a
supposition...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
wanted
to
go
forward.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
agree
that
there
is
a
constitutional
duty
to
provide
adequate
representation
about
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
appeal.
the
question
is,
when
you
come
in
on
habeas
ex
post
and
you
look
back
under
conditions
usually
of
great
uncertainty
about
what
happened,
where
is
the
risk
of
error
going
to
fall,
and
we
think
it's
inappropriate
in
those
circumstances
for
it
to
fall
entirely
on
the
state,
which
is
what
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
does
here.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
instead,
what
you
should
look
at
is
whether
there
is
any
reason
to
think
that
counsel
was
incompetent,
which
there
is
not
here,
and
whether
there
was
any
reason
to
think
that
a
competently
counseled
defendant
would
have
gone
ahead
and
lodged
an
appeal,
and
the
answer
here
is
no,
because
on
the
sentencing
issue
there
is
no...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
is
an
improper
gloss
because
it...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
would
lead
to
inappropriate
results
that
do
not
sufficiently
respect
the
state's
interest
in
finality,
given
the
situation
in
which
this
will
come
up,
where
you
will
always...
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes
to
the
following
extent,
that
it
is
always
a
facts
and
circumstances
test,
and
if
the
defendant
doesn't
have
an
independent
source
of
advice...
this
is
really
what
pigaro
said.
if
a
defendant
doesn't
have
the
independent
source
of
advice,
then
he
may
very
well
need
it
from
counsel.
