h.

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-1441,
ernest
roe
v.
lucio
flores-ortega.
mr.
o'connor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can't
hear
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
raise
the
lectern
a
little.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
probation,
i
mean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
justice
stevens'
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
at
all
likely
in
the
california
courts
that
one
who
pleads
guilty
to
second
degree
murder
and
gets
a
sentence
of
15...
is
going
to
get
probation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
o'connor.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
denver,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
aren't
in
the...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
likely
would
that
be
on
your
familiarity
with
california
law,
that
he
pleads
guilty
to
second
degree
murder?
is
it
likely
that
he
would
get
probation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i...
my
question,
is
it
likely?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
an
alford
plea,
mr.
denvir?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
spin
our
wheels?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
penson
was
a
direct
appeal,
and
here
you're
on
habeas,
trying
to
reconstruct
something
that
happened
in
the
past.
i
think
there's
something
to
what
the
government,
the
solicitor
general
says
here,
that
you
have
to
balance
the
rights
that
existed
at
one
time
against
how
do
we
reconstruct
as
best
as
possible
when
the
right
was
given
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
because
the
guy
didn't
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
was
lost.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
an
attorney
commit
herself
to
in
this
case
if
she
files
a
notice
of
appeal?
i
mean,
that's
a
simple
enough
thing
to
do,
but
does
she
commit
herself,
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
the
court
of
appeals,
to
proceed
with
the
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we're
talking
about
the
constitution
here...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
about
the
aba
standard
or...
and
certainly
california
isn't
bound
by
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
which
you're
quite
right
make
it
as
you
say,
but
why
should
we
incorporate
those
into
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
california
have
sentencing
guidelines
the
same
way
the
united
states
does?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
denvir.
mr.
o'connor,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
anybody?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'connor.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1441,
roe
versus
flores-ortega
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
