there
is
a
duty,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
26
of
what,
mr....
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
the
facts,
though...
what...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
find
reversed...
if
it's
conceivable,
what
are
the
factors?
the
recitation
by
the
sg
of
california
law
is
1203(e)(2)
prohibiting
probation
except
inand
then
california
rule
of
court
413(c),
which
specifies
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
a
case
is.
o
what
are
the
factors
that
might
make
this
unusual?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
the
factors...
my
question
is,
what
are
the
factors
that
could
have
made
this
aas
listed,
i
guess,
in
this
rule
of
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
so
my
question
is,
what
are
the
circumstances
that
might
have
justified
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
worries
me
is
that
there
are
85
percent
of
all
of
these
cases
settle,
i
mean,
guilty
pleas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suddenly
we're
proliferating
vast
numbers
of
appeals
in
the
case
where
there
is
no
ground.
if
there
is
a
ground,
well
then,
it
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
suddenly
to
proliferate...
you
know,
i
have
no
idea
how
many...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
ground
is
what's
worrying
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
the
end
of
the
world?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
indeed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
for...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
wonderful
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
goes
beyond...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
experience
of
the,
say,
80
to
90
percent
of
the
cases
that
are
settled
by
a
guilty
plea,
of
that,
what
percentage
in
your
experience
appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any...
can
you
give
me
any
ball
park...
because
you
defend...
you're
aware
of
it.
maybe
you
can't.
i
mean,
maybe
you
can't.
