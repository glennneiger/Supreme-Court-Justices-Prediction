justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
your
opening
statement
you
built
into
it,
and
now
i'm
wondering
whether
you're
taking
out
of
it,
you
said,
in
a
case
where
defendant
was
notified
of
the
right
to
appeal.
here,
the
notice
came
from
the
court.
suppose
we
have
the
same
case,
except
that
the
court
never
told
defendant
anything
about
his
right
to
appeal.
is
your
view
any
different,
does
anything
turn
on
the
court
having
said,
defendant,
you
have
to
appeal
within
so
many
days,
if
you
want
a
lawyer
and
you
can't
pay
for
one,
we'll
appoint
one.
suppose
the
court
had
not
said
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
immaterial
that
the
court
told
the
defendant
in
this
case,
you
have
a
right
to
appeal,
so
many
days,
we'll
appoint
a
counsel
if
you
can't
pay
for
one?
here,
there
was
no
at
least.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say,
as
a...
you're
favoring
the
ninth
circuit
per
se
rule,
so
that
it
would
be
immaterial
that
the
court
in
fact
notified
the
defendant
had
a
right
to
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'connor,
do
you
agree
on
the
basic
proposition
that
a
trial
counsel
or,
in
this
case,
plea
and
sentencing
counsel,
does
have
an
obligation
to
explain
to
the
defendant
what
an
appeal
is
and
what
his
rights
are?
and
then
switching
from
the
question
of
whether
a
notice
has
to
be
filed,
is
there
an
obligation
to
advise
the
defendant
about
an
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
he
doesn't...
defendant
in
this
case,
the
magistrate
found
the
defendant
didn't
know
anything
about
an
appeal.
doesn't...
but
you
say
he
must
inquire...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
he
doesn't
have
the
knowledge
to
inquire,
it's
too
bad?
