justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
could
provide
a
remedy
for
(d)
without
necessarily
providing
a
remedy
that
gives
you
recovery
here.
you
use
the
word
conspiracy
as
what
is
outlawed
by
1962(d).
the
noun
conspiracy
really
can
have
two
different
meanings.
it
can
refer
to
the
act
of
conspiring,
or
it
could
refer
to
the
confederation
formed
by
the
act
of
conspiring,
you
see.
you
know,
saying
he's
part
of
the
conspiracy,
the
group
of...
1962(d)
does
not
use
the
noun
conspiracy.
it
uses
the
verb,
which
really
has
only
one
meaning.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
conspire
to
violate,
so
the
act
of
violating
(d)
is
the
act
of
conspiring.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
has
your
client
been
harmed
by
the
act
of
conspiring,
directly
harmed
by
the
act
of
conspiring?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
62.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
using
the
noun
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
the
conspiring,
the
formation
of
that
agreement
harm
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
and
he
may
have
been
injured
by
the
overt
act,
but
i
don't
see
how
he
was
injured
by
the
violation
of
(d),
which
is
the
conspiring.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
further
down
the
line,
though.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
directly
injured,
and
you
could
say,
sure,
you
know,
the
act
of
conspiring
had
as
its
object
this,
and
in
pursuing
that
object
they
injured
your
client,
but
that's
further
down
the
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wasn't
one
of
the
predicate
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
your
argument
for
direct
results
of
the
conspiracy
would
be
much
stronger
if,
indeed,
it
was
one
of
the
predicate
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we're
under
(d),
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
ironic
that
you're
appealing
to
what
congress
intended,
and
you
tell
us
it
intended
to
reach
organized
crime,
which
indeed
i
think
it
did,
which...
you
know,
i
view
that
as
people
in
pin-striped
suits
carrying
machine
guns,
and
here
you're
going
after
people
in
doctor's
robes
carrying
scalpels.
i...
why
should
i
interpret
rico
any
more
broadly
than
i
absolutely
must,
given
the
fact
that
it
has
misfired
so
much
from
what
it
was
aimed
at?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
reads
in
anything
to
say
that
you
have
not
been
hurt
by
the
conspiring.
i
think
it
reads
in
something
to
say,
well,
you
may
not
have
been
hurt
by
the
conspiring,
but
the
conspiring
had
as
its
purpose
something
else,
and
you
have
been
hurt
by
the
furtherance
of
that
purpose.
if
i
read
it
as
narrowly
as
it
must
be
read,
it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
been
hurt
by
the
conspiring.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you're
right,
i
think
the
strongest
argument...
incidentally,
i
don't
think
it's
your
opponent
who
makes
the
argument
about
the
conspiring.
it's
one
of
the
amicus,
as
i
recall.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
weakest
point
of
that
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
which
the
amicus
is
willing
to
accept,
is
that
if
that
argument
is
right,
you
would
not
only...
your
client
would
not
only
be
not
able
to
recover
for
a...
an
act
that
is
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
but
not
one
of
the
predicate
acts...
justice
antonin
scalia
your
client
wouldn't
even
be
able
to
recover
for
a
predicate
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
deprives
(d)
of
all
of
its
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
does
it
deprive
(d)
of
all
of
its
meaning?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
conspiracy
law
has
two
effects.
number
1,
it
makes
the
act
of
conspiring
unlawful,
so
that
you
can
prosecute
even
before
there's
been
any
crime.
the
act
of
conspiring
becomes
a
crime.
that's
one
effect.
the
second
effect
is
that
all
of
the
people
who
are
in
the
conspiracy
can
be
held
liable
for
the
effects
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
why
doesn't
it
give
(d)
enough
of
an
effect
to
say
that
it
continues
to
have
in
the
civil
context
that
second
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
giving
them
two
different
meanings.
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
say
that
it
means
the
same
thing.
i
am
just
responding
to
your
argument
that
(d)
has
no
effect,
and
i
think
you're
right
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
conspiracy
law
would
have
very
little
effect
under
(d).
it
would
be
very
rare
that
the
mere
conspiring
would
harm
anybody.
i
concede
that.
however,
the
other
effect
of
(d)
would
still
be
considerable,
namely,
where
there
is
an
injury
under
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
it's
not
only
the
person
who
actually
committed
that
injury
who
is
held
liable
under
rico,
but
all
of
the
co-conspirators.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
an
adequate
scope
of
operation
for
(d).
justice
antonin
scalia
although
that
is
the
usual
consequence
of
conspiracy
law
in
the
civil
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
renders
more
people
liable.
it
doesn't
render
acts
unlawful
that
are
otherwise
not
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
any
injury
that
is
a
consequence
of
an
act
that's
necessary
for
the
completion
of
the
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
in
order
to
complete
their
scheme
they
have
to
close
one
factory
and
give
the
business
of
that
factory
to
another
factory,
and
they
do
it.
they
shut
down
the
factory.
i
assume
that
everyone
who
loses
a
job
in
factory
a
has
a
rico
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
they
be
direct
victims?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
essential
to
the
scheme
that
you
close
a,
just
as
it
was
essential
to
their
scheme
here,
according
to
your
complaint,
that
they
get
rid
of
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
hurt
the
factory?
justice
antonin
scalia
take
the
factory
out
of
the
picture.
in
order
to
effectuate
the
scheme,
they
have
to
get
rid
of
one
group
of
executives
and
put
the
business
in
question
with
another
group
of
executives,
so
they
get
rid
of
the
first
group
of
executives.
all
of
those
executives
who
were
fired
were
fired
by
an
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
they
would
all
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
were
executives
of
the
factory...
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
these
were
executives
of
a
separate
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
they
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
no,
no,
it's
your
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
i...
yes.
yes,
i
understand
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
starkman,
don't
you
see
any
inconsistency
between
your
insistence
upon
absolute
proximity
of
causation
with
respect
to
the
issue
we've
just
been
talking
about,
who
can
sue
because
of
a
nonpredicate
act,
and
your
willingness
to
allow
quite
extensive
causation,
not
at
all
proximate,
on
the
very
basic
issue
of
whether
(d)
makes
unlawful
the
consequences
of
a
conspiracy,
or
just
the
conspiring?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
on
that
issue,
you
know,
when
i
put
it
to
you
that
all
it
makes
unlawful
is
the
conspiring,
you
say,
well,
the
conspiring,
that
automatically
includes
not
only
the
predicate
acts,
but
any
acts
that
are
ultimately
necessary
to
conduct
the
conspiracy.
i
mean,
that's
really
stretching
out
the
causation
from
the
mere
language,
to
conspire.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
was
under
a
(c),
that
was
under
a
(c)
claim,
right...
justice
antonin
scalia
not
under
a
(d)
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
had
to
do
it
under
(c).
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
that's...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
take
a
simple...
no,
you
go.
i
think
i
know
what
your
problem
is,
mr.
rosenbaum.
it's
the
statement
you
made
earlier
that
these
nonpredicate
acts
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
goal
of
the
conspiracy,
which
is
to
commit
the
predicate
acts.
that's
simply
not
true.
the
goal
of
the
conspiracy
is
not
necessarily
to
commit
the
predicate
acts.
most
of
the
predicate
acts
are
simply
means
along
the
end
to
the
goal.
some
of
the
means
along
the
end
to
that
goal,
killing
the
bank
guard,
happen
to
be
unlawful
acts
covered
by
rico,
and
therefore
they
become
predicate
acts,
not
because
they
are
the
goal
of
the
conspiracy...
they
didn't
intend
to
kill...
the
object
wasn't
to
kill
the
guard.
it
was
to
get
the
money
in
the
bank.
so
whether
something
is
a
predicate
act
or
not
a
predicate
act
has
nothing
to
do,
whether
it
is
central
to
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
something
can
be
just
as
central,
in
fact
more
central,
more
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
than
a
predicate
act
is
and
not
be
a
predicate
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
you
get
there
through
the
text,
is
my
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
you
get
there
through
the
text.
i
mean,
it
may
be
a
very
nice
disposition,
but
how
do
you
get
there
through
the
text
of
1964
and
1962?
justice
antonin
scalia
1964
makes
a
violation
of
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d)
unlawful.
(d),
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
conspire.
once
you
say
that
the...
that
you
have
committed
the
unlawful
act
of
conspiring,
and
once
you
acknowledge
that
the
unlawful
act
of
conspiring
has
as
its
direct
consequence
some
predicate
acts
but
also
some
nonpredicate
acts,
it
seems
to
me
you've
been
injured
by
a
violation
of
(d).
justice
antonin
scalia
cat
burglar
in
suburban
virginia.
it
was
a
very
prominent
case
around...
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but...
just
foreseeability,
i
thought
your
point
was
that
you're
only
liable
for
unlawful
acts...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
are
done
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
for
foreseeable
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
does
get
you
where
you
want
to
go.
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
really
didn't
take
this
case
to
determine
whether,
you
know,
whether
beck
was
terminated
because
what
he...
of
what
he
had
already
done,
or
what
he
would
do.
that's
not
why
the
case
is
up
here,
and
i
think
the
point
you're
now
arguing
is
precluded
by
the
question
presented.
i
mean,
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
employee
who
is
terminated
for
both
blowing
the
whistle
on
and
refusing
to
participate
in
a
pattern
of
predicate
acts
may
assert
a
civil
rico
conspiracy
claim
where
he
has
been
injured
by
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
rico
conspiracy.
what
you're
now
arguing
to
us
is
that
the
act
was
not
in
furtherance
of
a
rico
conspiracy.
that's
not
why
we
took
the
case.
let's
assume
that
it
was
in
furtherance
of
the
rico
conspiracy
and
get
on
with
the
argument
on
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
furtherance.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
arguing
they
were
punishing
him
for
past
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
simply
wrong.
it
is
not
formed
for
the
purpose
of
committing
the
predicate
acts.
indeed,
some
predicate
acts
may
not
even
be
foreseen.
it
is
formed
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
the
bank,
and
the...
now,
that
larceny,
it
may
be
one
of
the
predicate
acts,
but
other
predicate
acts
on
the
way
to
it,
such
as
killing
the
bank
guard
who
unexpectedly
shows
up
to
try
to
prevent...
that's
not
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
at
all.
it's
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
it,
and
it
happens
also
to
be
a
racketeering
act,
but
there
are
other
overt
acts
in
furtherance
of
it
which
will
not
be
racketeering
acts,
such
as
firing
people.
