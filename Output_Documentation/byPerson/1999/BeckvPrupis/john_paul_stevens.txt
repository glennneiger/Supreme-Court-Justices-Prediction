justice
john
paul
stevens
stick
with
the
verb.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
that
connection,
how
significant
to
your
case
is
it
that
there
may
be
a
whistleblower
involved?
on
your
theory,
does
it
matter
whether
he's
a
whistleblower
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
because
he's
a
whistleblower,
or
independent
of
his
possibility
of
doing
any
whistleblowing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
under
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
what
was
the
nature
of
his
threat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
translate
that
to
facts
instead
of
sort
of
a
general...
what
did
he
do
that
prevented
the
conspiracy
from
being
consummated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he's
already
done
that...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
notion
is
that
by
firing
him
they
would
prevent
him
from
reporting
facts
to
the
regulators?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say,
in
an
analogy,
as
justice
breyer
suggested
to
the
antitrust
cases,
is
this
like
firing
a
salesman
who
refuses
to
go
to
price-fixing
meetings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
at
this
point.
you've
explained...
say
you've
convinced
me
that
this
doesn't
apply
to
whistleblowers.
that's
only
half
of
the
question
presented
by
the
cert
petition,
which
is,
he
was
terminated
for
both
blowing
the
whistle
and
refusing
to
participate
in
the
pattern
of
activity.
and
what
if
one
could
show
that
in
order
to
close
the
factory,
which
is
the
object
of
the
objective,
you
had
to
fire
executive
a,
who
would
otherwise
have
had
sufficient
strength
to
prevent
the
closing
of
the
factory.
why
isn't
that
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
covered
with...
as
an
overt
act
in
pursuance
of
the
conspiracy,
even
if
the
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
whistleblowers?
