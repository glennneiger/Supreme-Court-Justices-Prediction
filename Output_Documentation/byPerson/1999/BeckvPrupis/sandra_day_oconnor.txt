mr.
rosenbaum,
section
1962(d)
i
gather
has
been
held
to
give
rise
to
criminal
liability
as
well
as
a
civil
cause
of
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
there
be
a
criminal
prosecution
brought
here
without
proof
of
any
predicate
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
overt
act...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
an
act...
proof
of
an
overt
act
would
not
be
required
if
it
were
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
effect
of
this
is
that
we
have
very
different
rules
applicable
in
the
civil
action
context...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
very
same
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
i
thought
we
had
gotten
over
the
use
of
the
standing
point.
justice
ginsburg
directed
your
attention
to
whether
it's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
i
don't
see
how
we're
getting
into
standing,...
