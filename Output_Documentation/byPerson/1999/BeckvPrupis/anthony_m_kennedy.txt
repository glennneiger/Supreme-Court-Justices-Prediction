justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
wasn't
injured
by
the
formation
of
the
agreement,
and
that
was
the
conspiracy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
all
the
conspiracy
was.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
say
that
we
rule
against
you
on
this
point.
predicate
acts
still
are
committed
sometimes
in
concert
with
others,
in
joint
participation.
the
standard
law
of
torts
would
give
recovery
for
that
in
most
instances,
so
you
wouldn't
really
need
the
conspiracy
section
for
vicarious
liability,
or
for
joint
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
it
creates
four
separate
causes
of
action,
but
that's
the
issue,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
all
of
those
were
criminal
acts.
the
question
here
is
whether
they
were
all
causes
of
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you're
just
stating
the
conclusion
when
you
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
find
it...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mm-hmm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sedima
did
say,
though,
that
congress
did
not
want
to
have
the
standing
problems
that
antitrust
cases
had.
sedima
did
say
that,
did
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
fine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
disagree
with
that.
