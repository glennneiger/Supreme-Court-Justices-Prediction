mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
a
question
posed
to
mr.
starkman
as
to
why
there
should
not
be
rico-type
injury,
just
as
there
is
in
antitrust
law,
antitrust-type
injury,
he
referred
to
the
holmes
decision
and
suggested
that
the...
the
holmes
decision,
at
least
in
a
footnote,
stands
for
the
proposition
that
rico
injury
is
not
necessary.
what
mr.
starkman
is
referring
to
is...
excuse
me...
footnote
15
in
the
holmes
case,
which
he
misreads
in
its
entirety.
footnote
15
to
the
holmes
case
simply
says,
based
upon
sedima,
that
we
don't
require...
the
court
in
that
case
said,
we
don't
require
the
amorphous
concept
of
racketeering-type
injury,
because
that
was
the
holding
in
sedima.
the
holding
in
sedima
also
was,
however,
pursuant
to
a
1962(c)
substantive
claim,
that
there
must
be,
not
racketeering
injury,
because
the
term
is
too
amorphous.
there
must
be
predicate
act
injury.
so
when
you
read
the
footnote
that
mr.
starkman
is
referring
to
in
the
context
of
the
questions
posed
to
him
as
to
why
there
shouldn't
have
to
be
rico-type
injury,
what
comes
from
it,
what
flows
from
it
is
the
necessity,
at
the
very
least,
that
there
be
predicate
act
injury.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
in
a
way,
your
honor,
but
sedima
ultimately
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
must
be
predicate
act-type
injury
as
opposed
to
the
more
amorphous
concept
of
racketeering
injury.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
holmes,
which
flows
from
sedima,
comes
to
a
similar
conclusion,
comes
to
a...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
think
the
analysis,
the
analogue
to
antitrust,
applies
even
in
the
situation
that
you
described,
your
honor.
congress
delineated
no
fewer
than
50
predicate
acts.
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
by
virtue
of
the
written
word
was
to
deter
the
commission
of
the
predicate
acts.
justice
scalia
asked
mr.
starkman
about
the
difference
between
the
verb,
to
conspire,
as
opposed
to
the
noun,
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy.
when
you
read
1962(d)
in
context,
it
simply
says,
it's
unlawful
to
conspire
to
violate,
in
this
instance
1962(c),
by
conducting
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
conduct.
reading
the
two
together,
and
i'll
get
to
1964(c)
in
a
moment,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
unlawful
conspiracy
must
be
to
conduct
the
predicate
acts
in
violation
of
1962(c)
that
shaped,
the
civil
remedy
that
flows
from
the
conspiracy
to
violate
is
shaped
by
the
language
in
1964(c).
that
language
says,
anyone
injured
by
reason
of,
in
this
instance
a
violation
of
1962(d),
has
civil
rico
standing.
the
words,
by
reason
of,
cry
out
for
shaping,
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
the
analogous
antitrust
case
of
agc,
associated
general
contractors,
which
the
court
also
picked
up
on,
obviously,
in
holmes.
those
words
cry
out
for
shaping,
and
the
court
shaped
those
words
in
the
antitrust
context
in
associated
general
contractors.
the
court
thereafter
shaped
those
words
in
the
context
of
rico
by
limiting
standing
to
those
proximately
injured
by
the
unlawful
conduct.
what
the
court
said
in
holmes...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that's
correct,
but
the...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
think
you
also
have
to
do
it
under
(d),
because
1964
(c)
is
equally
as
applicable
to
(d)
as
it
is
to
(c).
therefore,
when
the
court
decided
holmes,
it
was
really
deciding
the
extent,
the
limitations
of
the
by-reason-of
language
in
1964(c),
whether
it's
an
(a),
a
(b),
a
(c),
or
a
(d)
violation.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
on
this
record...
on
this
record,
and
i
think
my
adversary
essentially
conceded
away
his
argument
when
stating
that
if
it
is
a
conspiracy
which
is
interfered
with
as
a
result
of
the
termination,
you
should
have
standing,
but
if
it's
in
retaliation
for
already
having
blown
the
whistle...
he
made
that
response
to
one
of
the
questions...
then
obviously
the
retaliation
is
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
on
this
record,
that's
precisely
what
occurred
here
based
upon
the
pleadings
that
the
plaintiff,
that
the
petitioner
filed
in
the
lower
courts...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
because,
aside
from
the
factual
basis
on
which
this
case
came
to
this
court,
the
injury
sustained
by
the
whistleblower,
even
if
it
was
allegedly
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
are
tangential
to,
are
tangential
to
the
principle
goal
of
the
conspiracy,
which
was
to
commit
the
predicate
acts...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
my
answer
to
that
lies
in
the
holmes
analysis.
while
there
may
be
injuries
that
flow
from
the
conspiracy,
and
perhaps
cause...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
every
wrongful
act
under
this
statute
does
not
necessarily
result
in
standing.
if
i
concede
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
the
termination
was
unlawful
and
was
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
that
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
whistleblower
has
rico
standing.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
tried
to
think
of
examples,
prior
to
coming
here
today,
of
where
some
nonpredicate
acts
could
be
the
basis
of
rico
standing,
and
i,
at
least
within
my
own
thinking,
have
been
unable
to
come
up
with
any,
based
upon
the
underlying
theme
in
my
argument
that
any
act
not
a
predicate
act,
even
an
act
which
may
be
necessary
for...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that
may
be
so,
justice
scalia,
but
the
answer
to
the
question
that
i
think
is
being
posed
to
me
is
whether
or
not
that
goal,
albeit
essential
to
the
completion
of
the
conspiracy,
still
provides
a
basis
for
rico
standing.
you
can
draw
inferences
from
the
antitrust
analogue
that
while
there
is
an
injury
that
is
essential
to
the
outcome
of
the
conspiracy
to
violate
in
this
instance,
or
in
the
antitrust
instances
antitrust
law,
that
injury,
so
says
this
court
in
several
cases,
is
not
necessarily
compensable
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
consider.
that
was
the
result
in
associated
general
contractors,
where
the
very
goal
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
injure
the
labor
union.
this
court
said
that
we
don't
look
at
the
necessary
intent
of
the
respondents
in
that
case,
the
defendants
in
that
case,
to
injure
the
plaintiff.
he
may
be
injured,
and
he
may
have
other
remedies,
but
at
least
within
the
statutory
scheme
of
antitrust
law,
which
this
court
essentially
looked
at
in
the
holmes
case,
he
doesn't
suffer
the
necessary
type
of
injury,
even
in
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
to
make
it
actionable
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i'm
sorry,
justice...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
get...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
get
there
this
way.
i
distinguish,
firstly,
the
difference
between
civil
conspiracy,
which
is
just
the
existence
of
the
agreement
which
in
and
of
itself
is
unlawful,
whether
or
not
it
injures
anyone,
and
a
civil
conspiracy
which
requires
more
than
just
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy,
because
nobody's
injured
just
by
virtue
of
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy.
the
law
of
civil
conspiracy
is
that
the
act
that
becomes
actionable
must
be
a
tortious
act,
and
in
cases
from
this
court
going
back
to
the
late
1800's
in
the
case
of
adler,
in
the
case
of
nalle,
this
court
said
that
the
act
that
gives
standing
must
be
the
act
that...
for
which
the
conspiracy
was
formed.
in
an
interesting
opinion
from
the
d.c.
circuit,
justice
scalia,
that...
the
halberstam
opinion,
there
was
some
interesting
language.
you
were
on
the
panel
together
with
judge
bork
and
judge
wall
to
issue
the
opinion.
that
was
the
case
where
a
prominent
washington
physician
was
murdered
during
the
course
of
a
burglary.
his
estate
brought
suit
against
a
coconspirator
who
did
not
participate
in
the
burglary,
the
wife
of
the
principal
culprit.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
thought
you
might
remember
it.
in
any
event,
what
the
court
held
in
that
case,
similar
to
what...
to
the
language
in
the
late
1800
cases,
in
adler
and
nalle,
was
that:
one,
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy,
to
give
standing
to
a
civil
plaintiff,
that
civil
plaintiff
must
be
injured
essentially
by
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy,
and
the
court
said
in
that
opinion
that
the
conspiracy
laws
are
essentially
on
the
books,
be
it
common
law
or
statutory,
for
the
purpose
of
creating
vicarious
liability
essentially,
the
statute,
the
common
law
said
the
court
there
was
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
all
of
those
within
the
umbrella
of
the
wrong,
the
wrong
being
the
intent
to
commit
the
particular
tortious
act
there,
the
burglary,
ergo
the
murder,
are
held
accountable.
not
everybody
in
the
conspiracy
is
held
accountable
for
every
single
act
done
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
it
depends
upon
whether
the
act
was
foreseeable
within
the
normal
realm
of
what
one
might
expect
based
upon
the
particular
type
of
conspiracy.
in
the
instance
of
a
whistleblower,
someone
who
allegedly
threatens
the
viability
of
the
conspiracy,
i
think
that
falls
outside
of
that
circle.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that
is
my...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that
is
my
point.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that
is
my
point,
justice...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
no,
i
haven't.
i
haven't.
the
court
a
moment
ago
asked
me
for
a
conceptual
answer
to
that
question.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
answer
the
question
based
upon
what
happened
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
what
happened
prior
to
that
based
upon
this
record.
i
am
dealing,
obviously,
on
behalf
of
my
client
with
respect
to
this
record.
there
is
no
issue
of
beck
being
a
stop-gap,
him
being
necessary,
his
elimination
being
necessary
to
allow
the
conspiracy
to
go
forward.
on
this
record,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
this
was
a
retaliatory
discharge.
that
wasn't
its
legal
conclusion.
the
way
the
case
was
pleaded,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
69,
paragraphs
49
through
roughly
51,
that
was
the
allegation
of
conspiracy.
in
that
allegation
of
conspiracy,
the
plaintiff
contended,
mr.
beck
contended
that
after
he
notified
the
florida
department
of
insurance
of
alleged
wrongdoing,
he
was
discharged.
that
theme
was
the
theme
on
the
summary
judgment
motion,
your
honor.
that
theme
was
also
the
theme
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
from
which
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
said
that
there
was
a
partial,
using
the
eleventh
circuit's
language,
there
was
a
partial
disclosure,
the
cat
already
being
out
of
the
bag.
ergo,
under
the
facts
as
pleaded
and
as
argued
in
the
summary
judgment
motion,
there
could
not
be
an
act
in
furtherance,
even
if
there
was
an
unlawful
conspiracy,
and
assuming
that
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
continue
undetected,
because
the
detection
had
already
occurred
by
virtue
of
mr.
beck's
conduct.
he
alerted
the
very
agency
that
had
sole
jurisdiction
over
this
company
to
investigate,
and
did
investigate
the
company,
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
any
improper
acts
occurring.
so
on
this
record...
on
this
record,
as
mr.
starkman
said,
if,
in
fact,
the
whistleblowing
had
occurred
before
the
termination,
which
it
did,
then
the
act
of
termination
couldn't
be
in
furtherance
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.
there's
another
reason,
however,
why
whistleblowing
of
this
sort
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
the
basis
of
rico
standing.
in
listing
the
predicate
acts
of
196...
sorry,
1961(1),
several
of
the
predicate
acts
include
obstruction
of
justice.
listed
as
one
of
the
predicate
acts
is
a
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
1513,
which
is
a
retaliatory
aspect
of
the
obstruction
of
justice
statute.
congress
limited
conduct
to
be
obstruction
of
justice,
limited
it
to
physical
harm
to
one's
person,
or
harm
to
tangible
personal
property.
a
precursor,
a
draft
precursor
of
the
statute
included
within
it
harm
to
a
person's
business,
or
harm
to
property
nontangible
in
nature,
wrongful
discharge.
that
was
eliminated
from
the
final
draft,
which
to
me
reflects
the
fact
that
congress
at
least
had
in
mind
potential
claims
by
whistleblowers
who
were
making
obstruction
of
justice
a
predicate
act,
and
determined
that
there
were
too
many
difficulties...
too
many
difficulties
in
seeking
to
enforce
that
because
of
the
multitude
of
motives
that
may
exist
when
terminating
somebody.
was
someone
terminated
because
he
really
was
a
threat
to
criminal
proceeding,
or
the
prosecution
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
or
the
detection
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
or
was
he
terminated
because
of
legitimate
business
reasons.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i'm
arguing,
justice
scalia,
that
even
if
it
was
in
furtherance
of,
he
doesn't
have
standing,
a)
because
this
is
not,
as
i
said
before,
a...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
not...
no,
this
is
not
a
whistleblower
statute.
there
is
no
specific
remedy
in
this
statute
for
whistleblowers,
as
there
are
in
other
federal
statutes,
environmental
statutes,
civil
rights
statutes...
had
congress
intended
to
create
that
breadth
of
a
remedy...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
from
a
factual
standpoint,
yes,
but
i'm
trying
to
respond
to
your
honor's
question.
assuming
that
the
facts
were
different,
assuming
that
he
was
terminated
because
he
threatened
to
blow
the
whistle
and
was
terminated
essentially
to
prevent
him
from
doing
so...
not
the
facts
in
this
case,
but
i'll
assume
it
for
your
honor's
question.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
even
so,
he
lacks
standing,
a)
because
this
is
not
a
whistleblower
statute...
congress
has
enacted
whistleblower
statutes
in
other
contexts
when
seeking
to
enforce
violations
of
other...
other
violations
of
other
types
of
statutes,
environmental
statutes,
civil
rights
statutes,
so
on
and
so
forth,
so
had
congress
intended
to
do
that,
it
certainly
knew
how
and
could
have.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
yes,
it
is,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
the
two
go
hand-in-glove.
i
think,
as
the
court
indicated
in
holmes,
it
used
a
proximate
cause
analysis
to
determine
whether
someone
remotely
down
the
linear
chain
in
effect
had
standing
to
seek
relief
under
rico,
so
i
think
the
two
go
together.
it's
a
question
of
nomenclature.
i
don't
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is
essential
to
the
outcome.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
absolutely.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
absolutely.
under
the
criminal
concepts
of
conspiracy,
or...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
all
that's
necessary
for
a
criminal
prosecution
is
proof
of
the
unlawful
agreement.
however,
in
the
criminal
context,
which
distinguishes
section
(d),
the
interpretation
of
section
(d)
from
the
similar...
a
similar
interpretation
in
the
civil
context,
the...
if
there
is
an
overt
act,
it
may
be
a
completely
innocent
overt
act,
but
it's
demonstrated
to
the
court
to
show
that
the
conspiracy
is
at
work,
so
that
in
a
criminal
context,
a
completely
innocent
overt
act...
if
it's
a
mail
fraud
conspiracy
i
go
out
and
buy
stationery
to
facilitate
the
mail
fraud.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
no.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
it's
not
necessary
to
show,
but
it's
certainly
helpful
in
demonstrating
that
there
is
a
conspiracy.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that's
correct...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
for
a
very
good
reason.
this
is
both
a
criminal
and
a
civil
statute.
in
order
to
have
criminal
liability,
as
i
said
before,
all
that's
necessary
is
to
show
from
a
criminal
standpoint
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy,
but
that
doesn't
provide
a
civil
cause
of
action,
because
the
mere
existence
of
a
conspiracy
absent
some
injury,
some
tortious
conduct
directed
at
someone
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy
doesn't
create
civil
liability
because,
as
this
court
has
said,
as
have
other,
lower
courts
have
said,
a
conspiracy
absent
an
injury
does
not
provide
a
civil
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i'm
sorry,
justice,
why
isn't...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
for
the
same
reason
that
it's
not
covered
as
a
basis
of
whistleblower
standing
in
antitrust
cases,
which...
in
which
the
clayton
act
uses
the
same
language
as
1964(c).
that
issue
has
been
presented
to
circuit
courts
throughout
the
country,
and
except
for
one
circuit
court,
in
an
opinion
which
was
later
limited
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
ostrofe
case,
all
of
the
circuit
courts
say
that
the
nature
of
the
injury
suffered
by
the
whistleblower,
even
in
the
context
that
you
gave
me,
is
not
compensable
based
on
the
statutory
scheme,
which
requires,
in
an
antitrust
concept,
antitrust
injury.
all
of
the
courts
have
said...
all
of
the
courts
have
said
that
even
though
there
may
be
wrongful
conduct
in
terminating
the
employee
because
of
his
threat,
that
isn't
enough
to
give
that
person
standing.
by
analogy,
by
analogy
that
logic
seems
applicable
here.
the
only
court
that
has
held
that
such
a
whistleblower
in
that
situation
has
standing
is
the
ninth
circuit,
in
which
justice
kennedy
dissented,
and
that
decision
in
ostrofe,
which
was
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
was
then
about
a
year
or
two
later,
severely
limited
to
say
that
it
was...
that
the
case
was
limited
to
its
facts,
and
virtually
all
of
the
circuits
deny
standing
in
an
antitrust
concept
based
upon
that.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
it's
a
violation
of
the
statute,
justice
o'connor,
to
unlawfully
conspire.
in
a
civil
context,
absent
injury,
absent
injury,
the
mere
existence
of
the
conspiracy
does
not
provide
a
civil
cause
of
action.
the
question
therefore
becomes,
what
type
of
injury
must
be
sustained
in
order
to
have
a
claim
under
1962(d).
it's
our
position
that
the
only
type
of
injury
that
must
be
sustained
where
it's
a
1962(d)
claim
related
to
a
1962(c)
violation,
the
only
type
of
injury
is
a
predicate
act
injury,
because
the
unlawful
conspiracy
is
formed
for
the
purpose
of
committing
the
predicate
acts,
that
there
may...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
my...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
it
certainly
is
like
the
anti...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
it
certainly
is
like
the
antitrust
laws,
because
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
the
language
is...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
if
the
law
is
to
protect
those
who
are
improperly
terminated,
there
are
more
than
adequate
state
law
remedies
to
protect
that.
virtually
all,
short
of
all
of
the
states
have
wrongful
discharge
statutes,
or
have
wrongful
discharge
common
law
that
basically
says
that
it's
tortious
to
discharge
someone
for
the
type
of
conduct
that's
alleged
here.
to
incorporate
that
state
common
law
into
the
rico
statute
would
essentially
be
to
federalize
what
are
otherwise
state
law
claims,
so
that's
my
direct
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
may
i
respond
to
your
question?
the
red
light...
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
the
policy
reasons
lies
in
this
court's
opinion
in
holmes.
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
injury
by
reason
of,
you
look
at
the
notions
of
what's
judicially
or
administratively
convenient.
using
that
test,
the
court,
as
you
know,
then
basically
said
that
there
must
be
direct
injury.
mr.
michael
m.
rosenbaum
thank
you,
your
honor.
