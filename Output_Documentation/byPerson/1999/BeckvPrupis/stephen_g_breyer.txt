justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say
about,
is
the...
the
language
of
1964(c)
is
very
similar
to
the
private
treble
damage
antitrust
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can
a
whistleblower
bring
an
antitrust
suit
against
a
group
of
price
fixers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not,
all
right,
so
how...
what's
the
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
thought
perhaps
this...
your
opponents
are
basically
saying...
it's
the
same
concept
that's
here.
it's
not
literally
the
same,
but
it's
the
same
idea.
it's
really...
this
statute's
aimed
at
substantive
violations,
giving
people
treble
damages
for
those,
not
for
these
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
holmes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
curious,
while
you
have
a
chance...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
just
like
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
simply,
treble
damages
is
a
very
big
gun...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
since
it's
a
huge
gun,
we're
going
to
keep
the
court's
attention
fixed
on
the
real
harm
that
flows
from
this,
not
side
issues,
where
there
are
other
laws
that
can
help
the
people.
why
isn't
that
reasoning
exactly
the
same
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
said
what
the
policy
was.
the
policy
is
to
help
people
who
are
hurt
by
the
racketeering,
you
know,
directly.
racketeering
is
what's
bad,
the
predicate
acts,
just
as
the
antitrust
thing
is
especially
bad,
the
price-fixing,
and
side
issues
of
whistleblowers
and
so
forth
are
dealt
by
other
laws.
that
would
be
the
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
better
argument
i
think
was
that
the
essential
nature
of
rico
is
to
talk
about
an
enterprise,
and
the
harm
involved
is
a
certain
kind
of
a
company.
the
harm
involved
in
the
antitrust
area
is
a
certain
thing
that
happens
in
the
world,
and
firing
and
hiring
people
is
part
of
the
operations
of
the
company.
firing
and
hiring
people
is
not
part
of
the
operations
of
the
price
fix
insofar
as
it
affects
the
world,
and
therefore
there's
no
good
analogy
for
purposes
of
his
argument.
i
think
that
was
basically
his
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
probably
missing...
no,
go
ahead.
is
there...
was...
did
you
answer
that?
i
don't
want
to...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
correct,
then...
your
language
permits
your
interpretation
and
his,
in
my
view.
absolutely
ambiguous,
same
as
the
antitrust
laws.
your...
i
understood
your
argument
all
to
the
point,
the
reason
is,
i
would
have
thought
the
reason
is,
it
has
to
be
matters
of
policy.
is
it
more
like
the
antitrust
laws,
or
isn't
it,
and
he
gave
a
reason
why
it
wasn't,
and
you
know,
and
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
get
anywhere
beyond
the
policy.
it
either
is
like
the
antitrust
laws,
or
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the
language
is
identical.
i
just
pointed
out
to
you
initially,
he
gave
a
reason
of
policy,
why
the
policies
would
be
different,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
your
response
to
his
reason
of
policy.
