david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
on
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
if
you
don't
interpose
the
subsidiary
structure,
if
they
simply
close
the
factory
that's
part
of
their
operation,
every
employee
in
the
factory
would
have
the
rico
cause,
for
the
same
reason
that
the
executives
would
in
the
second
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
say
the
conspiracy,
you
mean
by
conspiracy
an
agreement
to
do
everything
that
is
necessary,
ultimately
to
effect
a
predicate
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
ultimately
a
predicate
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
must
include
a
predicate
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
reasonably
necessary.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
starkman,
i'm
sorry,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
going
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
the
last
time,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
object
of
a
proximate
cause
concept
is,
as
you
put
it,
to
prevent
the
ripple
effect
of
causation
from
going
on
infinitely,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are
doing
in
your
argument
is
avoiding
the
proximate
cause
requirement
simply
by
expanding
the
concept
of
the
conspiracy.
we
apply
proximate
cause
between
the
appropriate
act
and
the
effect.
you're
saying,
we're
going
to
broaden
the
class
of
appropriate
acts,
and
we're
going
to
end
up
with
the
same
kind,
it
seems
to
me,
the
same
breadth
of
scope
for
subsection
(d)
that
we
would
have
if
we
didn't
have
the
proximate
cause
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
that
what
you're
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i'm
saying...
forget
the
labels,
overt,
predicate
for
a
minute,
just,
act
that
causes
injury
which
is
actionable
under
the
statute.
i
couldn't
care
less
about
proximate
cause
if
i
have
carte
blanche
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
conspiracy
to
include
all
subsidiary
acts
which
may
be
necessary.
in
other
words,
i'm...
you
know,
i'm
getting
at
the
front
end
what
i
would
otherwise
lose
at
the
rear
end.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying,
in
effect,
you...
when
you
conspire
to
rob
a
bank,
you
conspire
to
get
by
the
guard,
and
you're
saying,
that's
pretty
darned
close
to
the
core
of
it.
that's
the
nub
of
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
his
argument
is
that
it
makes
no
sense,
as
a
practical
matter,
and
hence
should
make
no
sense
in
construing
the
statute,
to
think
of
the...
to
conceptualize
the
conspiracy
to
commit
the
predicate
acts
without
including
a
conspiracy
to
do
at
least
what
is
in
some
close
sense
necessary
to
effect
those
acts.
i
gave
him...
it
wasn't
his
analogy,
but
i
said,
you
know,
you
rob
the
bank,
you
include
in
your
conspiracy
the
knocking
off
the
guard
to
get
out,
and
he's
saying
that
to
construe
a
conspiracy
as
narrowly
as
you
would
have
us
do
is
simply
unrealistic
in
the
way
people
conspire
to
effect
an
object,
and
the
statute
should
reflect
that
common
sense.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
your
only
response
to
that
argument?
that
in
effect
is
saying,
even
if
he's
right,
i
will
still
win,
and
my
question
is,
why
isn't
he
right
in
his
claim
that
to
conspire
under
(d)
must
be
read
as
broadly
as
he
says?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you're...
that...
it
seems...
maybe
i
misunderstand
you,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
in
effect
just
denying
the
predicate
of
his
argument.
you're
saying,
well,
this
would
not
fall
within
what
is
necessary
to
effect
the
conspiracy.
this
is
too
tangential
to
it.
what
about
his
argument
that,
in
fact,
the
conspiracy
has
got
to
include
something
more
than
simply
the
agreement
to
commit
a
predicate
act,
and
the
more
has
got
to
be,
whatever
is
in
some
close
sense,
narrow
sense
necessary
to
effectively,
to
commit
the
predicate
acts.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
a
proximate
cause
analysis,
and
you
apply
proximate
cause
analysis
once
you...
once
you
have
identified
the
acts
which
are
wrongful.
he
is
saying,
we
are
now
at
the
stage
when
we're
trying
to
identify
the
acts
that
are
wrongful,
we'll
get
to
proximate
cause
later,
and
he's
saying,
wrongful
acts
must
include
those
acts
which
in
a
narrow
sense
are
necessary
to
commit
the
predicates.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it...
does
your
argument
assume
that
there
may
be...
i
think
your
argument,
however,
as
you're
making
it
now,
assumes
that
there
may
be
some
nonpredicate
acts
which
are
within
the
concept
of
the
conspiracy
and,
hence,
actionable.
you're
saying
not
everything
is.
he
would
agree
with
you.
how
about
some,
and
the
some
that
he
proposes
to
be
within
the
concept
of
the
conspiracy
are
those
without
which
you
can't
effect
your
conspiracy.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
that
we
would
still
reverse
the
judgment
below
on
the
basis
that
mr.
starkman
claims,
and
you
would
go
back
to
the
court
to
argue
whether
in
fact
there
was
sufficient...
sufficiently
tortious
character
in
what
was
done
here.
you
might...
he
might
win
this
battle,
you
might
lose
the
war,
but
i
don't
think
if
we
accept
your
view
that
necessarily
disposes
of
the
case
at
this
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
answer
leaves
open,
it
seems
to
me,
the
basic
policy,
the
broader
policy
question
that
justice
breyer's
question
to
you
raises.
let's
say
in
this
particular
instance
you're
right,
there
is
no
policy
reason,
perfectly
adequate
state
law.
that
leaves
open
the
question
whether,
on
the
broader
sense,
the...
we
should
construe
(d)
to
include
nothing
but
predicate
acts,
and
there
may
be
lots
of
instances
in
which
the
conduct
isn't
adequately
dealt
with
at
state
law.
