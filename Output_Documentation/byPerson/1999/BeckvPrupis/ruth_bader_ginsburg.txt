but
mr.
starkman,
it
does
undercut
your
plain
meaning.
if
it
doesn't
have
a
plain
meaning
in
an
antitrust
concept,
context,
if
there
is
the
four
antitrust
injury
explanation,
then
why
can't
there
also
be
here
a
rico-related
interpretation?
in
other
words,
if
we
reject
your
plain
meaning,
isn't
it
appropriate
for
the
court
to
take
into
account
the
presumption
that
congress
does
not
mean
to
sweep
too
deeply
into
what
is
traditionally
a
domain
of
state
law?

suppose,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
beck
was
not
all
that
essential.
it
would
be
nice
to
get
rid
of
him,
but
we
can
carry
on
this
conspiracy
even
if
he
stays
there,
after
all,
look
at
all
the
years
he
was
there
and
didn't
even
know
what
was
going
on,
how
harmful
could
he
be.

mr.
rosenbaum,
you
keep
using
the
term
standing,
and
i
think
mr.
starkman
did
also,
i
thought
what's
presented
here
is
did
congress
create
a
civil
right
of
action
of
this
nature,
where
the
act
complained
of
is
not
a
predicate
act.
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
12(b)(6)
question,
is
there
a
claim
for
relief
that
can
be
stated,
but
you
keep
using
the
word
standing,
and
to
that
extent
mr.
starkman
is
in
agreement
with
you.
isn't
this
a
question
of,
did
congress
create
a
private
claim
for
relief?
