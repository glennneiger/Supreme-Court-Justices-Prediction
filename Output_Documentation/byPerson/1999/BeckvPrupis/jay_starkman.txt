mr.
jay
starkman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
many
cases
previously
before
this
court,
begins
and
ends
with
the
language
that
congress
chose
to
use
in
rico.
section
1964(c)
does
not
provide
a
civil
remedy
only
for
predicate
acts
as
defined
in
section
1961.
congress
also
did
not
draft
section
1964(c)
to
provide
civil
remedies
only
for
violations
of
1962(a),
(b),
and
(c),
or,
for
that
matter,
only
for
violations
of
1962(c).
congress
drafted
section
1964(c)
in
plain
and
unambiguous
terms
to
provide
a
civil
remedy
for
all
four
of
the
subsections
of
section
1962,
and
that
includes
1962(d),
conspiracies
to
violate
rico.
the
petitioner
here,
robert
beck,
was
injured
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
section
1962(b),
a
conspiracy
to
violate
rico,
and
under
the
plain
and
unambiguous
terms
of
that
statute,
that
is
all
that
is
required
to
provide
him
with
a
civil
remedy.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
that's
correct,
he's
not
injured...
mr.
jay
starkman
the
conspiracy
itself,
though,
has
several
objects.
l
one
of
the
objects...
well,
the
objects
are
obviously
to
violate
the
substantive
sections
of
that
statute,
but
overall
the
conspiracy
was,
let's
shake
down
contractors,
let's
commit
fraud,
and
let's
hide
it
all,
get
money,
invest
it
in
the
enterprise.
as
that
conspiracy
develops,
though,
as
with
all
conspiracies,
the
object
has
to
expand,
and
it
has
to
include
getting
rid
of
beck,
who
stood
in
the
way
of
that
conspiracy
continually.
he
was
a
threat
to
the
very
existence
of
the
conspiracy.
he
actually
was
more
important
than
one
of
the
victims
of
the
100
of
predicate
acts.
i
mean,
one
contractor
who's
shaken
down,
he
could
sue
through
rico,
but
which
is
more
vital
to
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy,
that
person,
or
beck,
a
person
who
could
have
brought
the
entire
conspiracy
down.
mr.
jay
starkman
but
here,
the
way
that
the
statute
was
drafted,
justice
kennedy,
the
statute
itself
created
four
separate
causes
of
action,
and
this
court
in
salinas
defined
the
words,
to
conspire,
which
only
appear
in
the
statute
once,
as
being
this
criminal
animal.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
sir,
but
just
because
those
words
are
defined
in
a
criminal
context,
they
shouldn't
have
a
different
meaning
in
another
section
when
that
other
section
refers
to
them.
mr.
jay
starkman
it
is
the...
well,
it's
the
way
the
statute's
written,
though.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
provides
a
forbidden
activities,
or
prohibited
activities
in
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d),
and
all
of
these
were
new
causes
of
action
that
had
to
be
created.
in
commonwealth,
for
example,
there
was
no
civil
action
for
investment
of
proceeds
from
racketeering
activity
to
acquire
control
in
an
entity.
mr.
jay
starkman
the
question
here...
mr.
jay
starkman
the
question
here,
justice
kennedy,
is
whether
or
not
1964(c)
provides
a
civil
remedy
for
each
of
those
causes
of
action.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
starkman
section
1964(c)
requires
an
injury
committed
by
reason
of
this
section.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
and
that
violation,
the
conspiracy...
mr.
jay
starkman
there
had
to
be
overt
acts
that
are
performed
as
a
result
of
that
these
people
conspire
in
order
to
trigger
1964(c)'s
injury
requirement.
mr.
jay
starkman
in
order
to
have
this
conspiring
of
people,
they
have
to
have
an
object,
which
is
the
three
subsections
of...
the
three
prior
subsections
of
1962.
that
object
expands.
the
conspiring
has
as
one
of
its
goals,
let's
get
rid
of
this
guy,
who
is
in
the
way
of
this
conspiracy.
it
is
one
of
the
agreements
that
they
make.
they
put
that
agreement
into
action
by
getting
rid
of
beck,
and
once
they
do
that...
mr.
jay
starkman
no,
it's
directly
down
the
line,
justice
scalia,
from
the
decision
that's
made
in
the
conspiracy
that
we
have
to
continue
with
this
conspiracy,
and
to
do
that
we
have
to
get
rid
of
this
person.
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him,
they
have
to
terminate
him,
and
wrongfully.
once
they
do
that,
he
is
injured
by
the
act
of
conspiring,
by
the
agreement
that
they
have
made
to
continue
this
pattern
of
criminal
acts,
the
pattern
of
racketeering,
to
do
all
of
the
things
that
they
were
doing.
this
injury
is
directly
related
to
the
conspiracy.
this
is
not
some
incidental
bystander.
for
example,
i
think
in
the
seventh
circuit
they
use
the
example
of
somebody
driving
to
rob
a
bank
and
hitting
one
of
the...
mr.
jay
starkman
no.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
it
would,
justice
scalia,
but
there's
no
basis
to
make
a
distinction
between
overt
acts
committed
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
and
predicate
acts
committed
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
when
we're
under
1962(d).
mr.
jay
starkman
if
we're
under
(d),
and
here
that's
all
that
we're
under.
here,
we
are
arguing
whether
or
not
the
1962(d)
violation
proximately
caused
injury
to
this
individual,
and
under
any
of
the
definitions
of
proximate
cause,
whether
it
be
direct,
as
was
articulated
in
holmes,
or
foreseeable
consequences,
intended
consequences,
lack
of
intervening
causes,
all
of
those
tests
are
satisfied
when
the
injury
is
directly
related
to
the
core,
if
you
will,
of
this
conspiracy.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
starkman
probably
not.
mr.
jay
starkman
the
distinction
is
an
antitrust.
the
rationale
used
by
all
of
the
lower
courts
that
fits
is
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
antitrust
injury
in
an
antitrust
action.
antitrust
injury
requires
an
analysis
to
make
sure
that
the
violation
is
being
caused
by
that
which
the
antitrust
laws...
mr.
jay
starkman
that
is
what
my
opponents
are
saying
in
this
case.
however,
that
policy
rationale
that
underlies
the
reasons
for
not
allowing
antitrust
whistleblowers
to
sue
doesn't
apply
in
rico.
there
is
no
countervailing
policy
to...
mr.
jay
starkman
there
are
three
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
it
was
not
congress'
desire
to
only
eliminate
predicate
acts.
those
were
already
illegal.
congress
was
going
further,
to
supplement
existing
state
remedies,
and
attacking
organized
crime.
there
was
a
need,
congress
felt,
to
go
beyond
what
was
already
existing,
so
it
only
federalized
the
rico
enterprise
itself,
and
it
used
language
that
was
broad
but
not
ambiguous.
mr.
jay
starkman
we
only
need
to
go
so
far
as
what
the
language
itself
says.
this
court
has
repeatedly
refused
to
write
in
requirements
that
don't
exist
in
the
statute
in
order
to
satisfy
this
concern
that
this
statute
is
misfiring.
for
example,
in
national
organization
of
women
v.
scheidler,
this
court
refused
to
write
in
an
economic
motive
requirement
because
the
statute...
and
the
lower
court
did,
because
it
was
concerned
for
this
very
reason,
that
the
statute
was
going
too
far.
but
the
language
of
rico
didn't
require
that,
and
in
sedima
this
court
refused
to
put
into
rico
the
requirement
that
we're
talking
about
here,
which
is
the
racketeering
injury.
mr.
jay
starkman
but
the
conspiring
is
not
just
the
conspiring
to
commit
the
predicate
acts
that
happens
when
they
first
sit
down,
justice
scalia.
the
conspiring
has
to
continue
throughout
the
life
of
this
conspiracy,
and
this
person
that
is
injured
is
injured
directly
by
the
conspiring.
he
is
injured
because
the
conspiring
has
had
to
make
one
its
goals,
we
need
to
get
rid
of
this
guy,
because
if
we
don't,
this
conspiring
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
continue.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
sir,
washington
law
foundation.
mr.
jay
starkman
uh-huh.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes.
mr.
jay
starkman
which
it
does.
mr.
jay
starkman
because,
justice
scalia,
in
order
to
do
that,
we
have
to
take
the
words,
to
conspire,
and
give
them
two
completely
different
meanings
in
two
different
sections.
those
words,
to
conspire,
are
defined
as
being
the
first
of
the
two
situations
that
your
honor
described,
the
act
of
conspiring,
this
conspiracy
animal,
and
what
1964(c)
does
is
gives
a
civil
remedy
for
that
conspiracy
that
is
pernicious
and
overrides
the...
mr.
jay
starkman
it
is
a
procedural
device,
then.
we
are
then
relegating
1962(d),
rather
than
providing
a
civil
remedy
that
expands
plaintiffs'
abilities
to
bring
suits,
we
are
changing
it
to
be
a
procedural
device
that
identifies
defendants
that
can
be
named,
and
that
is
not
what
1964(c)
provides.
1964(c)
by
its
title
provides
civil
remedies,
and
identifies
any
person
who
is
able
to
sue
under
its
provisions,
and
here
any...
mr.
jay
starkman
yes.
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
justice
scalia,
but
here,
1962(d)
is
identified
as
one
of
the
prohibited
conduct,
areas
of
conduct,
and
in
salinas
this
court
defined
what
that
was,
and
all
1964(c)
says,
its
plain
language
is
that
we
are
going
to
recognize
a
civil
remedy,
a
civil
action
for
that
criminal
violation.
that's
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute.
that
is
what
it
says.
and
in
holmes
this
court
restricted
the
reach
of
1962(d),
as
well
as
all
of
rico,
by
placing
in
the
time-tested
solution
for
this
problem
of
endless
ripples
of
civil
liability,
proximate
cause.
there
is
no
need
to
make
a
distinction
between
predicate
acts
committed
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy
and
overt
acts
committed
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy.
mr.
jay
starkman
i
think
it
does,
justice
stevens,
but
it's
not
crucial.
the
crucial
point
is
that
he
is
a
threat
to
the
continuing
viability
of
this
conspiracy.
mr.
jay
starkman
it's
independent,
because
for
example,
if
they
were
just
retaliating,
and
this
whistleblower...
for
blowing
the
whistle,
first
it's
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
but
it's
also
not
proximately
caused
by
the
conspiracy,
so
it's
not
the
fundamental
issue
of
whistleblowing.
it
is
that
this
person
has
become
a
threat,
and
in
order
to
deal
with...
mr.
jay
starkman
that
he
could
cause
the
conspiracy
to
cease
to
exist.
he
stood
in
the
way
of
predicate
acts
being
committed.
he
stood
in
the
way
of
the
continuation
of
the
conspiracy.
the
directors...
mr.
jay
starkman
well,
one
thing
he
did
was,
report
this
to
the
regulators.
another
thing
he
did...
mr.
jay
starkman
he
began
to
report
it
to
the
regulators.
he
had
not
finished
reporting
everything,
and...
mr.
jay
starkman
no.
no,
justice
stevens.
my
notion
is
that
what
happened
here,
one
of
the
key
facts
is
that
they
wanted
to
start
looting
this
company.
they
wanted
to
start
taking
money
out,
and
mr.
beck
stood
in
the
way
of
that.
he
said
no,
you
can't
do
that,
and
i'm
not
going
to
let
you,
and
what
they
did
thereafter
was
get
rid
of
him,
and
then
right
after
they
got
rid
of
him,
within
months,
they
commit
these
very
predicate
acts
that
he
was
preventing
before,
this
theft
of
money
from
the
lower...
from
the
subsidiaries,
this...
and
they
were
then
able
to
continue
the
things
that
he
was
starting...
mr.
jay
starkman
no,
it's
not,
because
there
you
again
have...
well,
it
is
on
some
levels,
but
the
analogy
isn't
apropos
because
you
have
the
antitrust
injury
requirement,
which
this
court
has
rejected
in
the
rico
context.
the
reason
that
that
salesperson
who
doesn't
go
to
the
meetings
doesn't
have
standing
under
the
antitrust...
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
starkman
in
holmes.
mr.
jay
starkman
it
was
actually
stated
in
a
footnote
that...
and
this
is
almost
a
literal
quote...
the
antitrust
injury
requirement
has
no
analogue
to
the...
to
rico,
and
it
was
for
this
very
reason
that
there
is
no
underlying,
or
there's
no
countervailing
policy
to
promote
racketeering
that
would
work
in
the
rico
setting.
mr.
jay
starkman
if
that
satisfies
proximate
cause.
mr.
jay
starkman
because
proximate
cause
can
go
further.
mr.
jay
starkman
no.
mr.
jay
starkman
because
they
would
not
be
direct
victims.
mr.
jay
starkman
because...
mr.
jay
starkman
the
factory
is
the
nearest
analogy
to
beck.
the
employees
at
the
factory
are
one
step
removed.
they're
incidental.
they
are
not
the
direct
victims,
so
if
the
factory...
mr.
jay
starkman
let's
assume
the
factory
was
a
separate
subsidiary,
because
then
i
think
it
makes
a
little
more
sense.
otherwise,
we
get
into
these
proximate
cause
problems.
but
what
your
honor
is
flushing
out
is
whether
or
not
the
overt
act
has
to
be
wrongful,
if
it
is
crucial...
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
because
they
are
proximately
injured
by
the
act
of
conspiring.
mr.
jay
starkman
if
the...
mr.
jay
starkman
assuming
the
factory
is
a
separate
animal,
that
it's
a
separate
company,
then
the
company
would
have
that
action.
for
example,
let's
assume
in
your
hypothetical...
mr.
jay
starkman
no,
because...
mr.
jay
starkman
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
sir,
because
i
don't
think
that
their
injury
is
direct.
i
believe
at
that
point
there
are
attenuating
circumstances
in
the
chain
of
causation,
and
that
is
the
proper
analysis.
the
distinction
is
not
whether
or
not
it's
an
overt
act,
or
whether
or
not
it's
a
predicate
act.
the
distinction
is
whether
or
not
their
injury
is
proximately
caused
by
the
conspiracy.
mr.
jay
starkman
i
think
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
jay
starkman
i
think
so
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
any
person
injured
by
reason
of,
which
is
proximately
injured,
by
the
violation,
here
the
violation
is
the
conspiracy,
and
the
only
analysis
then,
i
think,
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
is
whether
or
not
those
people
who
lose
their
jobs
proximately
lost
their
jobs
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy,
not
as
a
result
of
the
overt
act
of
closing
the
factory,
because
if
that's
the
analysis,
then
everything
would
fall
into
this
category.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
is
proximately
caused
by
the
violation.
here,
the
violation
is
the
act
of
conspiring.
mr.
jay
starkman
ultimately
to
effect
the
objects
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
jay
starkman
maybe,
and
maybe
not.
mr.
jay
starkman
ultimately...
mr.
jay
starkman
the
object
has
to
be
to
invest
the
proceeds,
for
example,
of
the
predicate
acts.
mr.
jay
starkman
or
to
acquire
control
of
the
enterprise,
or
the
situation
which
would
come
the
closest
here,
1962(c),
which
is
the
conducting
of
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise
through
a
pattern.
as
long
as
those
are
the
objects...
those
have
to
be
the
objects.
mr.
jay
starkman
then
the
overt
acts,
or...
that
are
taken,
that
are
necessary,
to
use
your
honor's
words,
or
the
heart,
or
the
goal,
would...
mr.
jay
starkman
reasonably.
mr.
jay
starkman
but
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
debate
about
what
is
the
most
efficient
one.
we're
not
rewarding
efficiency
here.
we're
just
following
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
jay
starkman
no.
mr.
jay
starkman
no,
i
don't
think
it
is,
because
we're
not
focusing
then
on
the
language,
to
conspire.
we're
focusing
on
the
proximate
cause
of...
mr.
jay
starkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
starkman
again...
mr.
jay
starkman
right.
mr.
jay
starkman
because
there's
no
countervailing
policy...
mr.
jay
starkman
i
don't
think
that's
accurate,
though,
because
the
evil
here
that
we're
combatting
is
not
the
racketeering
activity.
that's
not
what
congress
was
targeting.
those
were
already
unlawful.
what
congress
was
doing
was
seeking
to
eradicate
organized
crime,
and
organized
crime
has
no
countervailing
policy.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
starkman
no,
sir.
mr.
jay
starkman
because
proximate
cause
is
the
limiting
factor.
it
is
not
overt
act
versus
predicate
act.
mr.
jay
starkman
it
has
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
conspiracy,
though.
it
has
to
be
necessary
to
effect
the
object,
the
object,
again,
being
those
three
first
subsections,
and
the
object
here
was
being
prevented
by
beck.
nobody
should
have
more
of
an
appropriate...
there's
no
more
appropriate
person
to
bring
this
suit
than...
mr.
jay
starkman
yes.
mr.
jay
starkman
that
guard...
there's
a
question
about
whether
the
guard's
incidental,
but
if
the
conspiracy
was,
we've
got
to
get
past
that
guard
also,
because
he's
stopped
all
of
these
things,
and
we're
going
to
take
care
of
him
one
way
or
another,
then
that
would
be
act...
mr.
jay
starkman
essentiality
shouldn't
really
be
the
question
here,
because,
for
example,
what
if
they
could
have
just
intercepted
his
mail
to
prevent
it
from
going
to
the
regulators.
the
test
is,
though,
whether
or
not
it
was
at
the
core
of
the
conspiracy,
and
whether
or
not
it
was
necessary
to
effect
its
object.
