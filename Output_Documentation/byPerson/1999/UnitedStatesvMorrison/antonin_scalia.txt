justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
goldscheid,
were
all
of
these
instances
instances
of
gender
based
violence?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
this
law
doesn't
apply
to
any...
to
any
rape
or
any...
any
violence
against
women.
it
is
only
when
the
woman
is...
is
selected
because
of
her
sex.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
all
of
these...
all
of
these
instances
that
you're
referring
to
that
have
such
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
are
they
all
instances
in
which
you
have
somebody
who
just
hates
women
and
is
doing
it
for
that
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
most
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
nice,
but...
but
the
instances
on
which
that
finding
was
based
that
you're
now
alluding
to
don't...
aren't
limited
to...
to
gender
based
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
finding.
i'm
talking
about
the
evidence
that
supports
the
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me...
let
me
ask
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
similar
question.
it...
it
follows
from
my
last
one.
if
indeed
non
gender
based
violence
against
women
or,
for
that
matter,
against
men
also
has
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
i
suppose
congress
could
enact
a
general
criminal
statute
against...
against
violence,
a
federal...
a
federal
rape
law,
a
federal
robbery
law.
right?
a
federal
murder
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
aware
of
that.
i'm...
but
that's
why
i
posed
the
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
justification
for
the
statute
that
you're
now
giving
us
is
a
justification
that
would
allow
general
federal
criminal
laws
on
all
subjects
because
all
crime
affects
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
not...
is
that
not
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
see
why.
i
don't
see
why.
if
all
that
is
necessary
that
there
be
some
effect,
even
though
these
are
not
economic
matters
we're
talking
about,
but
that
there
be
some
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
you
have
a
federal
government
that
can
legislate
in
the
entire
realm
of
criminal
law,
which
is
certainly
not
what
the
founders
thought
they
were
creating.
it's
very
clear
that
they
didn't
think
the
federal
government
had
general
police
powers.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
think
you
are
suggesting
that.
that's
the
point
of
my
question.
tell
me
why
you
are
not
suggesting
it.
is
it
because
you
think
that
violence
in
general
does
not
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce,
although
this
little
narrow
category
of
violence,
namely
not
just
violence
against
women
but
violence
motivated
by
hatred
of
women,
that
little
area,
substantially
affects
commerce.
my
goodness,
certainly
murder,
rape,
robbery
affect
interstate
commerce
much
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
would
be
a
good
response
to
an
objection
that
congress
was
being
discriminatory
in
selecting
only
this
area
of...
of
crime
and
not
the
entire
area
of
crime.
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
is,
if
they
can
do
this,
surely
a
fortiori
they
could
enact
a
general
federal
robbery
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
it
should
have
been
your
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
get
that
principle
from?
you
see,
i
had
thought
that
we
had
a
supremacy
clause
in
the
federal
constitution
so
that
if
congress
does
have
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
pass
a
law,
it
automatically
has
power
to
sweep
away
all
state
laws
that...
that
interfere
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
what
difference
does
it
make
that
this
exercise
of
commerce
clause
power
happens
not
to
preempt
state
law?
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
difference
at
all.
if...
if
it
is
a
valid
exercise
of
commerce
clause
power,
they
can
preempt
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
this
one
is
squarely
directed
at
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
remedy
which
in
part
it
gave
the
states
$1.9
billion
to...
to
spend--
justice
antonin
scalia
--these
states
that
are...
that
are
just
bad
actors.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
had
just
said,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--state
courts--
justice
antonin
scalia
general
waxman,
can
you
give
us
a
single
opinion
in
which
this
court
has
suggested
that
some
activities
under
the
commerce
clause
are
valid
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
where
they
do
not
displace
state
action,
but
would
be
invalid
if
they
do
displace
state
action?
i'm
alluding
to
your...
your
dichotomy
between,
i
think
you
said,
preemptive
versus
complementary
federal
laws.
this
is
a
new
view
of
the
commerce
clause
to
me.
i
had
thought
if
the
federal
government
has
commerce
clause
power,
it
has
commerce
clause
power.
now,
you're
saying
that
it
has
it
in
some
areas
but
only
if
it
doesn't
displace
the
state...
state
action.
is
that...
is
that
the
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that
in
lopez?
i
had
thought
what
lopez
said
is
if
the
congressional
action
in
this
area
is
intruding
into
an
area
that
is
the
states'
exclusive
concern
under
the
constitution,
it
can't
do
it.
i
didn't
see
that
the
opinion
said,
well,
congress
can
sort
of
slice
the
bologna
and
say,
we're
going
to
intrude
but
not
too
much.
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
the
only
opinion
you're
relying
on,
i...
i
would
really,
you
know,
like
to
know
what
language
suggests
that.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--must
have
signed
on
to
it
unconsciously.
justice
scalia
the
government
argues,
mr.
rosman,
that...
that
we're
in
a
new
regime
after
lopez
and
that
what
we
should
do
for
non
economic
matters
is
not
to
say
that
absolutely
the
commerce
clause
power
exists
or
doesn't
exist,
but
rather
it
may
exist
so
long
as
the
government
doesn't
go
too
far
in
displacing
state
activity.
what...
what's
wrong
with
that
regime?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
read
it
that
way?
i'm
not
sure
what
your
reading
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
you
think
it's
the
assumption
congress
made?
i...
i'd
assumed
just
the
opposite,
that
it
was
very
clear
in
the...
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
understood
it
was...
it
was
just
addressing
a...
a
narrow...
a
narrow
spectrum
of
violence
against
women
and
wasn't
enacting
a
general
rape
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
why
do
you
think
that
congress
made
the
assumption
that
all...
all
rape
or
all
violence
against
women
is...
is
what
you
call
gender
based?
justice
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
of
ours
that
turned
on
the
existence
or
non
existence
of
congressional
findings?
justice
scalia
do...
have
we
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosman,
i'm
concerned
about,
you
know,
the
line
you're...
you're
urging
us
to
adopt
that
it
has
to
be
an
economic
activity.
i
mean,
you
know,
what
about
a
gang
that...
the
jesse
james
gang
that...
that
robs
interstate
trains?
that's
what
they
do.
violence
directed
against
the
actual
organs
of
commerce.
we...
the
federal
government
would
have
no
power
to
control
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
so,
all
robbery
is
economic
activity
in
your...
in
your
estimation.
we
can
have
a
general
federal
robbery
statute
because,
after
all,
it's
economic
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
surely
you
have
to
broaden
your...
your
argument
to
say
beyond
mere
economic
activity.
it
has
to
be...
you
have
to
allow
some
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
reach
activity
that
is
directed
against
commerce
whether
it's
economic
activity
in
and
of
itself
or
not.
justice
scalia
or
even
an
act
of
violence
on
an
interstate
train
or
on
an
airline
traveling
interstate.
justice
scalia
no,
i
don't
care
about
its
purpose.
that
isn't
its
purpose.
the
purpose
was
to
get
money
from
the
passengers,
but...
but
in
fact
it
occurred
in...
in
the
stream
of
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
wheat?
i
mean,
marijuana
is
different
from
wheat?
is
that--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
close
case
under
our
precedents.
it's
not
a
close
case
at
all.
justice
scalia
what
if
wheat...
he's
growing
wheat
in
his
back
yard
to
eat?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
you...
you
read
the
commerce
clause
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
lawful
commerce.
right?
unlawful
commerce,
the
sky
is
the
limit.
[laughter]
congress
has
no
power
to
regulate
that.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
section
5
does
not
provide,
as
a
remedy
for
the
state's
failure
to
abide
by
the
constitution,
the
federal
government's
abolition
of
the
federal
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
private
perpetrator
who
was
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
that
was
acting
under
color
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
any
private
individual
who...
who
is
participating
in
a
state's
violation
of
an
individual's
rights
can
be
sued
privately.
