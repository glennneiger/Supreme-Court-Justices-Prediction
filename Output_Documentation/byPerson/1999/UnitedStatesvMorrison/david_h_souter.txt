justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
well,
what
if...
what
if
congress
did
pass
a
general
murder
statute?
is
it
your
position
that...
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
did
trench
upon
a
traditional
sphere
of...
of
state
criminal
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
different
enough
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
the
criterion
tradition?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
about
the...
the
finding
that
there
was
a
$3
billion
effect
on...
on
the
gross
national
product
for
goods
and
services,
of
what
i
understood
to
be
gender
based
violence?
is...
is
that...
is
that
too
far
from
the...
from
the
causal
connection
that
would
satisfy
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
it
regulates
a
subset
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
relevance
of
the
$3
billion
figure?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
what
that
means
is
you're
going
back
to
the
argument
that
you
simply
cannot
regulate
anything
but
economic
activity
as
such
because
if
you
extend
regulation
beyond
that,
there
is
no
stopping
point.
that's
really
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if...
let's
assume
that
your
primary
argument,
that
pure
position,
is
not
accepted,
is...
is
there
something
insufficient
about
the
$3
billion
finding
to
support
this
kind
of
legislation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
regulates
a...
a
subset
of
it,
the
animus
kind
of
violence.
and...
and
i
would
suppose
that...
i
don't
know
that
the
government
made
this
argument,
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
could
reasonably
be
argued
that
from
a
finding
that
gender
based
violence
resulted
in
a...
in
a
$3
billion
effect
on...
on
the
economy,
loss
in
gross
product,
that...
that
one
could
also
infer
that
probably
the
substantial
or...
or
a
very
substantial
part
of
the...
the
violence
that
goes
to
produce
the
$3
billion
effect
was
animus
based
violence.
at
least
most...
most
gender
based
violence
i
presume
is
animus
based
violence.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a...
isn't
that
a
reasonable
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
finish
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
would
you
say
that
if
an
act
of
violence
were...
were
committed
simply
for
the...
for
the
purpose
of...
of
slowing
the
flow
of
goods
in...
in
interstate
activity
that
in
fact
that
would,
therefore,
be
subject
to...
to
congressional
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
test,
in
any
case...
you've
changed...
not
only
you've
changed
it,
but
you've...
you've
modified
your
statement
of
your
test
to
this
extent.
originally
i
thought
the
test
was
congress
could
regulate
only
economic
activity
as
such
under
the
substantial
effects
prong.
but
i
take
it
now
you're
saying
it
may
regulate
economic
activity
as
such
and
it
may
regulate
non
economic
activity
if
that
activity
was
intended
to
affect
economic
activity.
justice
david
h.
souter
by...
by
intent
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
let's...
let's
assume--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's
assume
the
marijuana
grower
says
i
want
to
grow
it
in
my
back
yard
solely
for
my
own
use
because
i
am
sick
of
being
gouged
by
the
interstate
marijuana
market.
[laughter]
doesn't...
doesn't
that
pass
muster
with
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
i
gave
you
an
easy
one.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
it
is
a
close
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
going...
going
back
to
section
5,
i
take
it
on...
on
your
view
any
civil
remedy
provided
by
congress
exceeds
the
section
5
power
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
may
be
brought
by
a
private
individual
against
a
perpetrator.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
