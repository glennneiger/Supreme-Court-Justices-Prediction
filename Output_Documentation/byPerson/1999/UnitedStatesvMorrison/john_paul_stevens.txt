justice
stevens
but
what
if
the
federal
statute
expressly
says,
this
will
not
preempt
state
laws
whatsoever?
justice
stevens
what
if...
what
if
a
federal
statute
had
that
provision
in
it?
justice
stevens
well,
if
that's
not
significance,
then
the
question
of
whether
there's
preemption
or
not
is
not
significant
either.
justice
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
of
the
proper
standard
this
court
should
employ
to
determine
the
accuracy
of
congressional
findings?
do
we
review
the
whole
legislative
history
and
decide
for
ourselves
whether
the
evidence
supports
the
findings,
or
what
do
we
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
what
your
view
of
the
proper
standard
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
do
you
agree
that
we
should
assume
the
findings
are
valid,
or
not?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
in
other...
you
say
we
should
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
findings
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
i
asked
you
what
standard
should
we
use
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
findings
supported
by
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
lopez
doesn't
address
this
question
because
there
were
no
findings
in
lopez.
and
what
i'm
particularly
interested
in
is
your
view
of,
one,
what
is
the
standard
by
which
we
should
review
the
findings,
if
they're
going
to
be
reviewed,
and
secondly,
does
it
matter
whether
we
accept
the
findings
or
not?
and
i'm
not
really
clear
on
what
your
answer
is
to
either
of
those
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
means
we
can
accept
the
findings
and
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
they're
valid
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--have
you
read
the
lopez
opinion
which
makes
quite
a
point
of
the
absence
of
findings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
give
you
one
example
i'd
be
interested
in
your
views
on?
assume
a
person
wants
to
grow
marijuana
in
his
back
yard
for
his
own
use
and
for
no
other
purpose.
could...
does
congress
have
the
power
to
prohibit
that
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
thought
your
view
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
pursue
this,
please,
for
this
one
thing.
regulating
a
lawful
market
in
wheat
is
one
thing.
regulating
a...
commerce
in
something
that's
forbidden
to
be
sold
is
quite
a
different
thing,
and
that's
why
i
think
you're
quite
right
in
saying
that
under
your
theory
you
could
not...
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
prohibit
mere
possession
of
marijuana
even
though
they
would
have
the
power
to
regulate
possession
and
growth
of
wheat.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
a
modest
change
in
this
statute?
say...
assume
this
statute
had
a
requirement
of
proving
a
jurisdictional
fact
in
each
case,
such
as
in
a
gun
case,
you
have
to
prove
the
gun
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
supposing
here
a
part
of
the
cause
of
action
was
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove
that
as
a
result
of
the
act
she
sued
on,
she
was
unable
to
enter
the
labor
market
or
unable
to
go
to
school
or
something
like
that.
would
that
save
the
statute
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
i
understand
it
would
be
different.
do
you
think
it
would
save
the
statute
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
my
question
is,
do
you
think
it
would
save
the
statute
if
it
had
that
element
in
this
case?
