mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
innovation
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
lopez
was
to
reiterate
that
under
the
commerce
clause
there
are
judicially
enforceable
limits
on
congress'
authority
and
to
explicate
what
those
limits
are.
and
we
think
that
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
satisfies
those
limits
in
the
following
respects.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
indeed,
we
are,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i'm
prepared
to
make
the
government's
argument
with
respect
to
both.
i
thought
i
would
start
on
the
commerce
just
to
fill
in
some
of
the
many
questions
that
were
answered.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
i
will
do
it
just
with
respect...
with
reference
to
commerce.
when
congress...
as
this
court
explained...
in
explaining...
the
explanation
for
why
it's
different
requires
a
somewhat
long
answer,
but
i
have...
i
do
have
the
question
firmly
in
mind.
[laughter]
believe
it
or
not,
i
had
the
question
firmly
in
mind
weeks
before
i
came
up
here.
my
answer
with
respect
to...
let
me
just
get
to
the
chase
and
then
give
you
the
explanation.
a
murder
statute
would
be
far
more
difficult
to
defend
under
lopez,
but
without
knowing
what
congress
found
and
what
the
factual
premises
were
for
such
a
statute
and
whether
it
was
preemptive
or...
or
complementary
i'm
not
able
to
say,
as
an
a
priori
matter,
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
but
our
defense
of
this
statute
doesn't
rely
on
a
conclusion
that
that
would
be
constitutional
for
the
following
reasons.
in
lopez,
this
court
explicated
what
we
take
to
be
a
four
part
test
in
judicial
scrutiny
of
legislation
that
congress
passes
under
the
substantial
effects
prong
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
which
is
not
itself
either
economic
or
commercial
or
part
of
a
legislative
effort
to
regulate
or
protect
the
specific
market.
and
lopez
was
the
first
such
case
that
this
court
considered,
and
this
one
is
quite
arguably
the
second.
and
what
the
court
said
in
lopez,
as
we
understand
it
in
both
the
majority
opinion,
joined
by
five
justices,
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
you...
that
you
authored,
was
that
congress
must...
the
court
must
independently
find
four
things:
first,
that
congress
did
act
to
protect
interstate
commerce.
in
lopez,
it
was
not
at
all
clear
that
that
was
true.
the
act
didn't
even
regulate
violence.
it
regulated
possession
and
only
within
a
school.
it
looked
much
more
like
an
effort
to
regulate
what
schools
should
be
doing.
secondly,
the
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--this
one
is
squarely
directed
at
violent
conduct
as...
okay.
i'm
coming
to
the
next
part
of
the
test.
[laughter]
the
court
has
to
find
also
independently...
and...
and
this
was
first
i
think
explicated
in
wirtz
v.
maryland.
the
court
must
find
that
congress
had
a
rational
basis
to
conclude
that
the
regulated
activity
substantially
affected
commerce.
third,
the
court
itself
must
find
independently...
and
this
i
think
is
an
innovation
of
lopez...
that
the
harm
on
congress
was
direct
and
not
attenuated
when
the
activity
being
regulated
is
not
itself
economic.
and
fourth...
and
this
is,
i
think,
what
gets
most
to
the
question
about
the...
the
murder
hypothetical.
fourth,
the
court
has
to
find
that
upholding
the
regulation
at
issue
does
not
require
the
court
to
embrace
a
rule
that
would
create
what
the
court
said
in...
in
jones
&
laughlin,
a
completely
centralized
government
by
obliterating
the
distinction
between
national
concerns
and
those
that
are
truly
local.
now,
the
difficulty
in...
in
other
words,
when
congress
is...
is
acting
with
its
commerce
clause
authority
in
this
unique
area
where
the
underlying
activity
is
not
itself
economic,
the
court
undertakes
an
evaluation
that
is
not
characteristic
of
the
type
of
evaluation
that
it
takes
in
the
ordinary
commerce
clause
situation
where
congress
is
seeking
to
regulate
a
channel
or
an
instrumentality
or
an
activity
that's
inherently
economic
in
itself,
and
it
looks
to
the
federal
versus
the
local
side
of
the
balance.
and
here,
unlike
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
no
such
hook
here
and
quite
deliberately
on
congress'
part.
and
let
me
answer
that
question
and
then
explain
the
essential
distinction
with
the
murder
statute.
here
congress
could
have
put
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
the
act
of
gender
motivated
violence
affect
commerce
or
substantially
affect
commerce.
and
under
lopez,
there
would
be
no
question
of
congress'
constitutional
authority
to
do
that.
but
we
submit
that
it
is
both
not
constitutionally
necessary
under
wirtz
and
the...
perez
and
the
other
cases
that
suggest
that
under
the
substantial
effects
test,
it
is
appropriate
for
congress
to
regulate
where
the
class
of
activities
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce
rather
than
the
particular
discrete
action.
and
that's
really
important
here
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
this
remedy
for
two
reasons.
one...
the
two
reasons
that
are
quite
specific
to
gender
based
violence.
one,
there
are
many
instances
of
gender
based
violence
that
don't
take
place
in
the
work
place
or
on
the
way
to
work
that
in
fact,
in
and
of
themselves
and
in
the
fear
that
they
instill
in
women,
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the
interstate
economy.
and
some
of
them
were
mentioned
by
my
colleague.
if
i
can
go...
and
therefore,
we
think
that
a
jurisdictional
element
in
this
case
as,
for
example,
didn't
exist
in
perez
or
in
wirtz
or,
for
that
matter,
really
even
in
heart
of
atlanta
motel,
because
congress
in
that
case
simply
decreed
that
any
commercial
establishment
that
accepted
a
transient
guest
sufficiently
affected
commerce...
so,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary,
and
we
don't
think
it
would
be
as
effective.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
very,
very--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--very
true,
and
we
don't
step
back
from
that
at
all.
it
was
important
for
this
court
in
heart
of
atlanta
motel
and
in
katzenbach
v.
mcclung
to
ensure
itself
that
there
was
a
substantial
effect
on
commerce.
my
only
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
i...
i
don't
think
under--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--my
theory
it
would
be
fine.
the
fact
that...
and
i
think
it...
it
would
run
into
problems
under
at
least
three
of
the
factors
that
i've
identified
with
respect
to
lopez.
the
fact
that
there...
congress
has,
of
course,
made
no
such
findings.
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed.
and
it
has
found
with
respect
to
gender
based...
the
criminal
prosecution
of
gender
based
violence
that
the
bias,
the
archaic
prejudices
and
improper
stereotypes
affect
the
outcomes
of
those
prosecutions
or
potential
prosecutions
in
a
significant
number
of
cases.
if
there
were
to
be--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed,
as...
as
part
of
the
package
that
includes--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
as
part
of
this...
well,
justice
scalia,
i...
if
i
can
just
respond
to
your
last
comment.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
this
statute
or
the
findings
that
support
it
or
the
legislative
record
to
suggest
that
congress
was
on
a
tear
to
deal
with
the
states
as
bad
actors.
the
findings
apply
equally
to
the
treatment
that
victims
of
gender
bias...
gender
based
violence
get
in
federal
courts
as
well,
and
it's
not
our
submission
that
states
themselves
are...
have
a
policy
of
discriminating
against
or
depriving
women.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there...
congress
found,
largely
by
reference
to
the
submissions
by
21
state
task
forces
and
testimony
of
state
attorneys
general
and
prosecutors
and
police,
that
archaic
prejudices
and
improper
stereotypes
by
people
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
a
significant
number
of
cases
were
affecting
outcomes.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
could
fairly
be
said
with
respect
to
domestic
relations
matters,
but
even
if
it
could,
justice
o'connor,
there
are
other
significant
differences
here.
if
this
were
a
statute
that
were
targeted
at
the
core
of
a...
of
an
area
in
which
the
states
by
history
and
tradition
lay
claim,
it
would
raise,
in
this
unique
area
of
commerce
clause
regulation
outside
of
an
economic
activity,
a
very
substantial
concern
on
the
state
side
of
the
federalism
balance.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
they...
they
may
or
may
not
be,
and
congress
didn't
base
its
establishment
of
the
remedy
on
a
conclusion
that
they
would
be.
the...
the
establishment
of
the
remedy...
the
reason
that
the
remedy
were
thought
by...
was
thought
by
congress
to
be
sufficiently
efficacious...
no
one
thinks
it's
going
to
eliminate
the
problem
of
gender...
gender
motivated
violence.
the
reason
it
was
thought
to
be
sufficiently
efficacious
to
try
as
part
of
a
multi
year,
multi
statute
scheme
is,
number
one,
it
gives
the
plaintiffs...
it
gives
a
category
of
people
that
congress
found
may
not
have
always
had
a
fair
chance
at
vindication...
an
alternative
forum.
it
gives
them
a
civil
forum.
it
gives
them
the
option
of
pursuing
that
in
a
federal
court
under
different
rules
with
different
burdens
and
with
certain
advantages
and
disadvantages.
and
it
was...
this
does,
i
think,
get
in...
somewhat
into
our
fourteenth
amendment
argument,
but
it
was
thought
to
provide
a
remedy
with
respect
to
both
the
commerce
clause
problem
that
commerce
sought...
congress
sought
to
address
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
problem
by
providing
this
category
of
people
a
means
to...
an
alternative
means
to
obtain
vindication
and
redress--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
a
choice
of
forums.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i'm
not...
i'm
not
saying
that
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
act
would
satisfy
this
court's
standard...
unlike
the
civil
provisions
would
satisfy
this
court's
standard
in
lopez
without
a
jurisdictional
provision,
and
here's
why.
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
statute
are
not
analogs
of
the
civil
remedy
provision.
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
were
included
in
a
separate
title
and
considered
separate...
entirely
separately,
address
themselves
to
the
crossing
of
state
lines
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
domestic
violence
or
violating
state
protective
orders.
the
crossing
of
state
lines
is
not
just
the
traditional
jurisdictional
element
whereby
congress
gets
to
grab
authority.
it's
the
element...
it's...
it's
the
actus
reus,
if
you
will.
and
if
congress
were
to
essentially
impose
a
remedy...
without
the...
without
the
jurisdictional
element
in
those
statutes,
congress
would
be
doing
what
i
think
was
suggested
it
might
be
doing
if
it
directed...
by
mr.
chief
justice...
if
it
directed
itself
at
simply
saying,
well,
they're
biased
in
domestic...
in
divorce
cases,
let's
federalize
it.
that,
unlike
this,
would
be
an
act
in
which
congress,
acting
in
this
special
commerce
clause
area,
would
be
directed
directly...
would
be
aimed
directly
at
what
the
states
traditionally
do,
and
that
would
change
the
balance
that
i
think
this
court
has...
certainly
the
concurring
opinion
in
lopez
suggests
has
to
occur
when
congress
is
operating
at
the
limits
of
its
commerce
clause
authority.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
i
was
with
you
entirely
until
the
court
decided
lopez,
and
i
think
what
the...
and
i
think
the
reason
i
was
with
you
is
that
the
court
had
never
considered
the...
as
it...
as
it
explained,
the
exercise
of
commerce
clause
authority
in
an
area
in
which
it
wasn't
channels
or...
or
instrumentalities
of
commerce,
and
under
the
substantial
effects,
it
wasn't
even
activity
that's
economic
itself
or
activity
that
protects
or
regulates
a
market.
and
what
we
understand
this
court
to
have
announced
in
lopez
is
that
when
congress
does
that,
there
has
to
be
a...
an
assurance
that
upholding
the...
the
regulation
does
not
require
the
court
to
embrace
a
completely
centralized
government.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i...
perhaps
i
don't
have
the...
the
opinion
with
me
right
here.
perhaps
on
rebuttal--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
language
both
in
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
language
both
in
the
majority
opinion
and
particularly
in...
in
the
concurring
opinion.
i
read
it
from
the
majority
opinion
by
the...
the
court's
analysis
saying
this...
congress
is
regulating
under
the
substantial
effects
test
and
this
is
not
activity
that's
economic
or
part
of
a
regulation
of
a
market.
it
doesn't
have
a
jurisdictional
element,
and...
and
then
the
court
goes
on
at
great
and
persuasive
length...
if
we
were
to
accept
the
government's
two
arguments
in
this
case,
it
would
obliterate
the
distinction.
the
concurrence
adds
that
in
the
instance
in
which
congress
seeks
to
regulate
with
respect
to
that
type
of
activity,
it
is
appropriate,
it
is
required
to
inquire
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
balance
is
changed.
and
our
submission
here
today
is
not
only
that
this
act
falls
on
the
appropriate
side
of
the
line,
but
that
the
creation
of
a
bright
line
test,
which
is
quite
inconsistent
with
this
court's
historical
commerce
clause
experience
that
simply
says
if
you're
operating
in
the
substantial
effects
area
and
it's
not
economic
or
identifiable
to
a
particular
market,
it's
invalid
would
be
a
very
unwise
rule
for
a
number
of
reasons.
there
are
lots
of
non
economic
activities
that
themselves
have
nothing
to
do
with
commerce
or...
or
the
economy
that
help
regulate
a
market.
drug
and
firearms
possession
laws,
for
example.
there
are
economic
activities
that
threaten
markets.
i'm
thinking
of
the
federal
access
to
clinic
entrances
act
and,
you
know,
acts
that
prohibit,
you
know,
blocking
the
entrance
to
an
exchange
of
some
sort.
and
there
are
other
acts
that
deal
with...
directly
with
activities
that
themselves
aren't
economic
but
that
themselves
have
substantial
effects
on
commerce.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
let
me...
let
me
shift
ground
briefly
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
submission
with
respect
to
the...
i
take
it
your
question
goes
to
why
this
is
an
efficacious
remedy
at
all
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
violation
that
we've
identified.
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
no,
no,
no.
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i...
if
i
said
that
it
was
just...
just
the
same...
just
the
same
as
what
these
plaintiffs
already
have
available
to
them
in
state
courts,
i...
i
mistook.
the...
the
federal
remedy
that
congress
has
enacted
provides
them
something
that
they
didn't
have
before.
now,
it
can
be
argued
that
they
already...
they
already
had
the
right
to
have
their
crimes
prosecuted
and
in
all
states
they
already
had
the
right
to
pursue
a
tort
remedy.
but
this
is
different.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
