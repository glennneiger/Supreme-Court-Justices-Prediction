ms.

mr....
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
civil
rights
remedy
of
the
violence
against
women
act
to
remove
one
of
the
most
persistent
barriers
to
women's
full
equality
and
free
participation
in
the
economy:
discriminatory
gender
based
violence.
a
bipartisan
congress
concluded
that
gender
based
violence
substantially
affects
the
national
economy
based
on
a
4-year
legislative
record
through
which
it
found
that
gender
based
violence
and
the
fear
of
that
discriminatory
violence
deters
women's
travel
interstate,
restricts
women's
choice
of
jobs
and
ability
to
perform
those
jobs,
reduces
national
productivity,
and
increases
medical
and
other
costs.
each
of
these
findings
was
fully
supported
by
evidence.
for
example,
congress
heard
from
women
whose
batterers
kept
their
partners
from
working,
who
wouldn't
let
them
leave
home
if
they
did
work,
or
who
inflicted
visible
injuries
so
that
they
were
afraid
to
go
to
work
or
were
physically
unable
to
show
up.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
not--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
statute
limits
each
individual
case
to
claims
in
which
a
woman
could--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--perhaps
not
each
and
every
instance,
but
congress--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--congress
looked
at
the
record
as
a
whole
and
explicitly
made
a
finding.
in
the
1994
conference
report,
congress
specifically
found
that
crimes
of
violence
motivated
by
gender
have
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
the
finding
that
congress
made
was
rational.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
the
evidence
that
supports
the
finding
was
in
the
record.
congress
also
specifically
found
that
some
acts
of
discriminatory
violence
could,
in
fact,
be
discriminatory.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
they
cited
the
case
of
meritor.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
this
case
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
hypothetical
that
you
propose
because
by--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--by
requiring
discriminatory...
a
showing
of
discriminatory
motivation
in
each
instance,
the
congress
specifically
removed
these
cases
from
the
kind
of
constitutional
shoals
that
the
court
in
griffin
v.
breckenridge
was
worried
about.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
as
we--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--it's
entirely
possible
that
all
crime
might
affect
interstate
commerce,
but
that
does
not
lead
necessarily
to
the
conclusion
that--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--a
general
tort
law
of
the
type
you
suggest
would
be
constitutional.
as
we
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
there
are
other
factors--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--and
we
are
not
suggesting
that
congress
would
have
that
authority.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
two
responses
to
your
question,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
this
court
long
has
held
that
especially
when...
when
congress
is
looking
at
a
general
social
problem
of
the
type
with
which
it
was
concerned
here,
congress
can
regulate
one
step
at
a
time,
and
that's
what
it
did.
so,
by
regulating
a
subset
of
the
general
activity
that
it
was
looking
at,
it's
consistent
with
this
court's
holdings.
in
addition--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--and
that
point
goes
to
the
second
part
of
my
response
to
your
earlier
question.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
i'm
sorry.
which
is
that,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
there
are
other
considerations
to
assessing
whether
or
not
a
law
that
regulates
intrastate
non
commercial
activity
is
constitutional.
and
the
heart
of
that
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
law
intrudes
on
an
area
of
traditional
state
concern.
and
we
simply
don't
have
that
here.
this
law--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--congress
certainly
does
have
the
authority
to...
to
preempt
state
law
in
areas
in
which
it
has
power.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
the
inquiry
derives
from
this
court's
concern
in
the
lopez
decision
about
obliterating
the
distinction
between
what
is
truly
national
and
what
is
truly
local.
and
the
standards
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
identifying
issues
such
as
what
was
presented
to
congress
here,
the
fact
that
the
problem
with
which
congress
was
concerned
is
discrimination,
which
is
uniquely
and
traditionally
an
area
of
federal
concern,
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
states
have
come
forward
and
have
said
that
they
need
federal
help
in
resolving
the
problem...
attorneys
general
from
38
states
testified
to
congress
that
the
violence
against
women
in
general,
and
the
civil
rights
remedy
in
particular,
was
a
law
that
would
help
them
resolve
this
problem
that
they
found
to
be
very
serious
and
entrenched
and
perplexing.
and,
of
course,
you
know
that
nearly
three
quarters
of
the
states'
attorneys
general
filed
briefs
with
this
court
in
support
of
this
law
here.
and
the
law
itself
works
no
usurpation
of
any
area
of
traditional
state
concern.
it
leaves
the
traditional
areas
of
divorce,
child
custody,
equitable
distribution
expressly
and
entirely
undisturbed.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
it
might
have
an
effect
on
commerce,
although
that
scenario...
if
you're
suggesting
a
scenario
that...
where
the
federal
government
would
propose
to
overtake,
say,
wholeheartedly
a
divorce
law,
that
would
be
stepping
into
the
shoes--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--it
might
well
be
a
harder
question
because
you
are
talking
about
an
area
that
is
more
traditionally
within
state
concern
as
compared
to
discrimination
which
is
historically
within
the
realm
of
the
federal
government.
what
the
law
here
regulates...
it
builds
on
this
court's...
this
country's
history
of
anti
discrimination
laws
through
which
congress
has
provided
means
of
redress
for
individuals--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--and
if
there
were
such
a
legislative
record,
that
would
certainly
be
a
closer
case
to
what
we
have
here
than
an
over
arching,
overall
regulation
of
divorce
law.
ms.
julie
goldscheid
it
would
be
very
different
from
our
scenario
here.
and
i...
i
think
the
answer
would
be--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--i...
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes.
first
of
all--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--it
would
be
several
things.
first
of
all,
it
would...
it
would
well
run
afoul
of
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
v.
breckenridge
which
said
that
absent
a
showing
of
discriminatory
animus
or
discriminatory
motivation
in
each
instance,
a
federal
tort
law
would
roll...
could
run
into
constitutional
shoals.
second
of
all,
in
a
federal
murderer
tort
law--
ms.
julie
goldscheid
--thank
you.
