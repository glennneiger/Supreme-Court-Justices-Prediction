justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
this...
this
court
has
had
a...
what
i
think
is
an
unfortunate
150
or
200-year
history
of
trying
to
draw
some
kind
of
line,
as
you
are,
between
local
and
interstate
effects.
most
of
those
have
failed.
what's
your
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
then
your
view
is
that
if
it
turns
out
that,
to
use
one
of
the
government's
examples,
people
are
in
their
own
houses
cooking
up
biological
warfare
or
it
turns
out
that
in
their
own
fireplaces,
they
pollute
the
air
in
a
way
that
will,
through
global
warming,
swamp
the
east
coast...
or,
you
know,
use
any
of
their
other
imaginative
examples...
congress
is
powerless
to
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
see
my
point.
my
point
is
that
there
are
many,
many,
many
instances
of
non
commercial
activity,
when
you
collect
them
all
together,
that
could
have
overwhelming
effects
on
interstate
commerce.
and
so
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
in
any
of
those
myriads
of
examples...
i
won't
be
too
far
fetched...
the
congress
is
powerless
to
act
simply
because
the
cause
of
the
major
economic
impact
is
itself
not
economic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
drug
laws
are
also
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--any
of
the
federal
government's
is
forbidden
from
regulating
federal
drug
laws
for
your
own
use
in
your
own
house.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if
i
reject
your
idea
that
congress
is
powerless
to
act
where
the
amazingly
strong
commercial
activity...
i
see.
sorry.
where
the...
where
the
non
commercial
activity
has
an
overwhelming
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
if
i
say
i
believe
there
congress
is
power...
empowered
to
act,
at
least
in
some
cases,
would
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
suppose
if
you're
going
to...
if
you're
going
to
take
a
less
extreme
position,
as
i
think
you
are,
in
this
answer,
what
about
a
test
that
said,
where
a
traditional
activity
of
a
state
is
at
issue,
what
we
will
do
is
require
that
congress
address
the
federalism
problem
and
explain
why
it
believes
in
this
traditional
area
a
federal
solution
is
needed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
think
they
made
the
argument
that
justice
kennedy
advanced;
that
is,
as
i
understood
his
question,
there
is
a
clear
finding
that
the
state
in
its
courts
or
in
its
legal
system
says
where
a
black
man
and
a
white
man
are
fighting
it
out
in
our
legal
system,
the
white
man
always
wins,
for
example.
and
so,
to
remedy
that
situation,
to
remedy
that...
nothing
to
do
with
the
white
man
who's
always
winning...
to
remedy
the
failure
of
the
court
system
to
apply
the
law
equally,
we
create
an
optional
federal
remedy.
that's
what
i
took
as
his
basic
question.
and
my
response
to
your
answer
would
be
could
you
explain
it.
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
good
remedy
for
a
state's
failure
to
follow
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be.
if
it
is,
they
didn't
address
the
argument,
and
therefore,
i
would
like
to
know
the
reasoning
as
to
why
that
isn't
a
remedy
for
the
state's
deprivation
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
enforcing
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
equal
protection
clause...
state,
treat
black
people
and
white
people
alike.
state,
you
have
failed
to
do
that.
therefore,
we
enforce
that
by
giving
the
black
person
this
federal
remedy.
