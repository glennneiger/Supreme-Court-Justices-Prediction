mr.
michael
e.
rosman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
enumeration
of
congressional
powers
in
the
constitution
provides
principled,
substantive
limits
to
those
powers.
for
each
of
the
two
powers
that
are
at
issue
today,
petitioners
ask
this
court
to
go
beyond
its
previous
holdings
and
to
enlarge
those
already
substantial
powers
even
further.
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause,
this
court
has
not
yet
held
that
congress
can
regulate
any
violent
crime
non
economic
in
scope
and
without
any
jurisdictional
element
tying
it
to
interstate
commerce
in
the
specific
instance.
with
respect
to
section
5,
this
court
has
not
yet
held
that
congress
can
remedy
violations
of
the
section
1
prohibition
against
state
denials
of
equal
protection
by
regulating
purely
private
behavior
that
could
not
possibly
violate
section
1.
under
these
theories,
congress
could
justify
laws...
virtually
any
laws...
in
domestic
relations
law,
crime,
tort,
areas
that
are
traditionally
governed
by
state
law.
and
as
justice
scalia
noted
earlier,
because
the
power
to
regulate
is
the
power
to
preempt,
congress
could
occupy
the
fields
in
these
areas
and
relegate
the
states
to
a
trivial
and
unimportant
role
in
our
federal
structure.
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--because
it's
been...
as
you
noted
earlier
and...
and
as
i
just
mentioned,
it's
been
the
traditional
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
the
power
to
regulate
is
the
power
to
preempt.
that
is
to
say,
if
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate,
it
can
displace
state
law
to
the
extent
it
chooses.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
this
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
the
gun
free
school
zones
act
had
that
provision
and
it
was
still
unconstitutional.
so,
i
would
not
think
that
would
be
of
significance.
what
the
court
focused
on--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
it's
not
significant.
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
we
think
that
lopez
best
drew
the
line
between
economic
conduct...
that
is
to
say,
conduct
which
is
connected
to
or
arises
out
of
a
commercial
transaction...
and
other
conduct.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
with
respect
to
the
first
example,
justice
breyer,
i
think
congress'
power
to
suppress
insurrections
would--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--yes,
justice
breyer.
we
think
that
is
the
best
reading
of
lopez.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
the
vast
majority
of
federal
drug
laws
regulate
the
sale,
manufacture,
and
possession
with
intent
to
sell
of
drugs.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
unless...
well,
i
do
know,
your
honor,
that
21
u.s.c.
801
has
made
various
findings
that
tried
to
connect
the
possession
of
drugs
to
the
interstate
sale
of
drugs.
whether
that
would
distinguish
lopez
or
not,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
would
not.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
you
would...
if
you
read
lopez
as
permitting
the
regulation
of
some
non
economic
conduct,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
non
economic--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--no,
i
do.
i
do
read
it
that
way.
i...
i
read...
i
read
lopez
as
precluding
the
regulation
of
non
economic
conduct.
i
was
responding
to
justice
breyer's
question
which
i
thought
the
presumption
of
which
was
that
congress
could
regulate
non
economic
conduct.
and
i
was
responding
by
noting
that
you
could
read
lopez,
i
suppose,
to
permit
the
regulation
of
non
economic
conduct,
but
it
would
have
to
be
in
a
way
that
differs
from...
the
effect
would
differ
from
the
effect
that
virtually
important
problem
has
on--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--that's
an
interesting
solution,
justice
breyer,
but
i
don't
think
it
really
relates
to
the
text
of
the
constitution
which
permits
congress
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
states.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
think
we're
challenging
them,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
sense
that
justice
scalia
suggested
earlier
on
today,
in
the
sense
that
all
of
the
studies
that
were
done
to
support
that
finding
are
much
broader
and
don't
really
relate
to
the
specific
conduct,
gender
based,
animus
motivated
violence,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
particular
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
first,
of
course,
this
statute
doesn't
regulate
simply
gender
based
conduct,
but
gender
based
and
animus
motivated
conduct.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
don't...
i
don't--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--your
honor,
findings
could
be
made
about
virtually
any
activity
and
its
effect
on
interstate
commerce:
marriage,
divorce,
virtually
all
crime.
it
has--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--that's
certainly
our
primary
argument
today.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
think
what
we
were
speaking
about
just
a
moment
ago,
the
fact
that
the
statute
doesn't
regulate
the
particular
conduct--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--well,
i
think
that's
the
assumption
that
congress
made,
and
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
congress
had
any
basis
for
believing
it.
i
think
that's
the
best
way
of
putting
it.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
correct,
justice
scalia.
what
i
was--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--well,
i
think
that
they
concluded
that
it
somehow
constitutes
a
significant
part
of
the
economic
effects
of
it.
but
as
you
point
out,
that's
contrary
to
their
equally...
well,
it's
contrary
to
the
conclusion
or
the
statements
that
are
made
in
the
legislative
record--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--that
this
stuff
does
not
constitute--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--does
not
constitute
a
significant
part
of
gender
based
animus--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i
think
this
court...
it's
unclear
after
lopez
precisely
the
standard
by
which
one
reviews--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--actually,
justice
stevens,
we
don't
think
it
much
matters
because
the
relationship
that...
between
the
conduct
being
regulated
and...
and
the
amount
of
commerce
being
affected
is
what
defeats
this...
not--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
there's
reason
to
question
the
findings
with
respect
to
gender
based,
animus
motivated
violence,
but
it
does
not
affect
our
argument
one
way
or
the
other
if
you
do
assume
it.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
the
findings
are
supported
by
the
evidence,
but
as
i've
said,
we
don't
think
that's--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i
see
what
you're
saying.
in
determining
empirical
effects,
effects
on
the
national
economy,
this
court
can
review
under
a
rational
basis
test.
the
question
whether
or
not,
though,
the
activity
being
regulated
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce
is
somewhat
different.
this
court
focused
on
two
factors
in
making
that
determination
in
lopez.
first,
the
nature
of
the
activity
being--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
that
it
doesn't
matter,
and
it
doesn't
matter--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--yes.
you
can...
you
can
still...
you
can
still
accept
the
findings
and
nonetheless
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
do
not,
no.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
have,
justice
stevens,
and
i
don't
think
it
does
make
that
much
of
a
point
of
the
absence
of
findings.
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
in
lopez
made
a
great
deal
of
the
absence
of
findings,
but
i
think
that
this
court
wrote
a
much,
much
different
opinion.
this
court
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
activity
being
regulated
and
the
absence
of
a
jurisdictional
element.
it
was
set
forth
in
the
very
first
paragraph
of
the
opinion
and
repeated
throughout.
the
possession
of
guns
around
schools
was
a
non
economic
activity,
and
that
was
so
even
though
schools
themselves
buy
things
and
employ
people
and,
no
doubt,
have
to
divert
resources
when
the
violence
is
threatened.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
presumably
that
would
fall
under
congress'
power
to
regulate
the
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
yes.
that's...
it
certainly
was.
there
are
going
to
be,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case
because
robbery
is
sort
of...
if
you
think
of
commerce
as
voluntary
exchange,
robbery
is
not
commerce.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
oh,
the...
the
standard
in
lopez
and
what
i
had
understood
the
definition
of
economic
activity
to
be
was
activity
that
arises
out
of
or
is
connected
to
commercial
activity.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
think
that
would
constitute
economic
activity
as
the
court
defined
it
in
lopez.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
yes.
that's...
that's
correct.
if
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
disturb
commercial
activity--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--well,
i
think
the
purpose
is
of
some
consequence,
but
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
particular
examples
that
you
identified
would
probably
constitute
economic
conduct,
as
the
court
identified
it
in
lopez.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
that's...
it
certainly
can
do
that,
justice
souter.
and
i
had
understood...
i
had
understood
lopez,
when
he
characterized
or
described
economic
activity,
to
include
activity
connected
to
a
commercial
transaction,
and
i
think
that
would
fall--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--yes.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
and...
and
i
would--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--well,
it...
it...
i
was...
i
was
going
to
provide
that
caveat,
justice
scalia--
[laughter]
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--that...
that
in--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--there's
always
going
to
be
some
close
cases.
i
think
the
specific--
[laughter]
i
think
the
specific
example--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i
think
there
is
that
difference,
justice
stevens.
thank
you.
and
what
i
was
trying
to
say
is
that--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--if...
no,
it
has
the
power
to
regulate
unlawful
commerce.
the
question
is
the...
is
the
possession...
the
regulation
of
possession
so
necessary
to
the
prohibition
of
marijuana
in
interstate
commerce
that
congress
should
be
able
to
reach
it,
just
as
it
was
able
to
reach
the
growing
of
wheat
in
wickard.
that's
the
question
that
needs
to
be
answered
before
i
could
come
up
with
a
definitive
response
to
the
hypotheticals
that
have
been
given
to
me.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i'd
like
to,
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
first,
justice
ginsburg,
as
we
spoke
about
earlier,
it's
our
view
that
the
power
to
regulate
is
the
power
to
preempt
so
that
whether
or
not
congress
has
exercised
that
power
in
a
specific
instance
ought
not
to
determine
whether
something
is
within
congress'
commerce
power.
second,
we
do
think
that
this
statute
does
displace
some
state
policies
in
the
same
way
that
the
gun
free
school
zones
act
displaced
some
state
prerogatives.
after
all,
the
gun
free
school
zones
act
didn't
preempt
anything
at
all,
and
yet
this
court
held
that
it
was
beyond
congress'
commerce
power.
what's
being
regulated
here,
of
course,
is
conduct--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--for
example,
there
are
various
assumptions
under
the
common
law
between...
about
parental
immunities
and
torts
between
people
in
the
same
family.
this
statute
says
when
you
consider
whether
or
not
something
is
or
is
not
a
felony,
you
must
disregard
the
relationship.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
if
a
state
had
a
similar...
i'm
sorry...
a
statute
that
disregarded
the
relationship?
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
yes,
by...
by
definition
if
they
have
exactly
the
same
statute,
there
would
be
no
clash.
but
virtually
all
states
have
a
basic
common
law
presumption
about
contact
and
torts
within
a
family
that
this
statute
asks
the
federal
government,
the
judiciary,
to
ignore.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
no,
just
as
there
was
no
particular
conflict
in
lopez.
there
was
a
statute
in
texas
which
did
the
same
thing
as...
as
the
federal
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
think...
i
think
the
jurisdictional
element
was
one
of
the
two
elements
that
lopez
identified,
and
that,
yes,
it
could
very
well.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
without
a
little
more
knowledge
about
the
exact
jurisdictional
element
that
you'd
be
adding,
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
for
sure.
but
yes,
it
would
be
a
much
closer
case
and
congress,
i
think,
by
adding
jurisdictional
elements
in
general...
your
general
idea
of
saving
this
kind
of
statute
by
adding
jurisdictional
elements
we
agree
with.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
sure,
i'd
love
to.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
well,
they
certainly
could
do
so,
justice
kennedy,
but
they'd
be
doing--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--oh.
then
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
that
they
could
not.
and
the
reason
derives
from
the
text
of
the
constitutional
provision.
the
constitutional
provision
states
that
congress
shall
enforce
the
prohibitions
in
section
1.
the
prohibitions
in
section
1
are
against
the
states.
it
says
no
state
shall
do
this,
no
state
shall
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
yes,
in
your
hypothetical
i
believe
there
was.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
assuming
that
states
were
acting--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--well,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
intrusive
on
the
states,
justice
kennedy,
and
this
court
specifically
considered
statutes
along
the
lines
of
what
you're
describing
in
united
states
v.
harris
and
the
civil
rights
cases.
congress--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--first,
as
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
think
that's
exactly
the
situation
that
existed
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
because
the
text
of
the
statute
says
that
congress
will
enforce
the
prohibitions--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--i
don't
believe
that
would
be
enforcement
litigation
because
it
would
be
doing...
legislation...
it
would
be
doing
nothing
to
the
states
to
get
them
to
comply
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
would
be
as
if
congress
decided
that
instead
of
having
schools
in
the
south
to
segregate
in
the
1950's,
they
would
offer
separate
federal
schools.
that
would
not
be
enforcement
legislation.
the
proper...
proper
interpretation
of
section
5
is
that
congress
must
do
something
so
that
the
states
are
no
longer
engaging
in
the
conduct
which
violates
section
1.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
that's
a
very
succinct
way
of
putting
it.
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
take
it
we've
moved
back
to
the
commerce
clause,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
because
this
isn't
commerce.
the
reason
that
there
was
harmonious
legislation
on
both
the
federal
and
state
level
in
the
examples
that
you
described
is
that
congress
is
regulating
commerce.
this
is
not
commerce.
this
is
violence.
this
is
interpersonal
violence,
the
kind
of
thing
the
states
have
always
had
the
exclusive
province
of
regulating
since
the
start
of
our
country.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
any
civil
remedy--
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
--against
private
individuals?
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
against
a
private
perpetrator.
yes.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
i
had
understood
justice
souter's
question
to
refer
to
someone
who
was
not
acting
under
color
of
state
authority.
you're
quite
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
rosman
as
this
court
has
been...
has
repeatedly
said
under
section
1983.
but
what
justice
frankfurter
said
in
his
plurality
opinion
in
united
states
v.
williams
is
that
an
individual's
interest
in
receiving
a
fair
trial
in
state
courts
cannot
be
constitutionally
vindicated
by
federal
prosecution
of
private
persons.
that's
essentially
what
this
statute
is
trying
to
do,
to
create
substantive
federal
law
to
remedy
state
violations
of
the
equal
protection.
it
is
not
enforcement
litigation.
and,
indeed,
the
various
statutes
that
we
spoke
about
just
a
moment
ago,
title
vii,
equal
pay
act...
thank
you,
your
honor.
