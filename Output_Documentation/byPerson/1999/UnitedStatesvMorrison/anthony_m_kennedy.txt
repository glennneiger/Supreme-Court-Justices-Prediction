justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
comment.
your
colleague
had
a
very
brief
time
to
answer
our
questions.
and
it...
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
she
was
being
pressed
upon
whether
or
not
a
murder
statute
could
be
enacted,
she
would
immediately
talk
about
discriminatory
animus
going
to
the...
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
question.
just
confining
yourself
to
the
commerce
clause--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--aspect
of
the
case,
can
you
address
the
questions
the
court
was
asking
about
murder
statutes
and
why
this
should
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
with
reference
to
commerce.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
defend
the
scheme
as
being
an
analog
and
the
same
and
therefore
not
a
displacement,
then
that
seems
to
me
to
cut
against
your
fifth
amendment...
fourteenth
amendment
argument
because
you're
not
adding
any
additional
remedy.
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
you're
caught
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
there.
justice
kennedy
yes,
because
you've
defended
it
as
saying
it's
just
the
same
under
thecommerce
clause.
justice
kennedy
and
now
you
get
to
the
fifth
amendment,
you're
going
to
say,
well,
it's
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
talk
for
a
few
minutes
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
congress
finds...
and
there's
substantial
evidence
for
the
finding...
that
if
black
people
are
assaulted,
prosecutors
do
not
treat
the
crime
as
seriously
as
they
do
if
there's
a
white
person
assaulted.
could
congress
pass
a
two
part
statute,
severable:
one,
making
it
a
federal
crime
to
assault
a
black
person
on...
on
account
of
his
race;
two,
giving
a
civil
remedy
to
a
black
person
who
was
assaulted
so
that
the
black
person
could
sue
the
white
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
its
fourteenth
amendment
powers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
that
in
my
hypothetical
i've
established
that
there
is
a
general
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
saying--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
congress
is
so
limited
in
the
remedies
that
it
can
choose,
that
it
cannot
create
a
private
cause
of
action,
which
is
really
in
a
sense...
we
can
argue
about
this,
but
in
one
sense
less
intrusive
on
that
states?
