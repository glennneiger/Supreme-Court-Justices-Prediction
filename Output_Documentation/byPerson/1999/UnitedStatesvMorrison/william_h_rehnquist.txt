rehnquist
general
waxman,
is
the
government
supporting
this...
the
constitutionality
of
this
legislation
both
on
commerce
clause
grounds
and
on
section
5
of

fourteenth
amendment?
chief

--if
we're...
if

are

be
any
better
with

in

i

they
come
from

that

[laughter]
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
consolidated
cases
99-5
and
99-29,
united
states
against
morrison
and
brzonkala
v.
morrison.
the
petitioner
christy
brzonkala
accused
the
respondents
antonio
morrison
and
james
crawford
of
brutally
assaulting
and
raping
her
while
the
three
were
students
at
the
virginia
polytechnic
institute.
following
the
attack,
morrison
made
vulgar
remarks
to
brzonkala
into
the
patrons
of
the
dormitory
dining
hall
indicating
that
his
attack
on
her
was
motivated
by
gender
based
animus
toward
women.
she
filed
a
complaint
against
respondents
under
virginia
tech's
judicial
system
but
the
university
ultimately
decided
not
to
punish
morrison.
brzonkala
then
sued
morrison
and
crawford
in
virginia
tech
and
federal
court.
arguing
among
other
things
that
morrison
and
crawford's
attack
violated
title
42
u.s.c.
section
13981.
that
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
violence
against
women
act
of
1994
and
it
provides
a
federal
civil
remedy
for
the
victims
of
gender-motivated
violence.
the
district
court
dismissed
brzonkala's
complaint
because
it
concluded
that
congress
lacked
constitutional
authority
to
enact
section
13981.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
sitting
en
banc
agreed
with
that
conclusion.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
every
law
enacted
by
congress
must
be
based
on
one
or
more
of
its
powers
enumerated
under
the
constitution.
in
this
case,
congress
relied
on
two
such
bases:
the
commerce
clause
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
we
conclude
that
neither
provision
is
sufficient
to
sustain
section
13981's
federal
civil
remedy.
we
most
recently
canvassed
and
clarified
our
case
law
governing
commerce
clause
regulation
in
lopez
against
the
united
states
several
years
ago.
in
lopez,
we
held
that
the
gun-free
school
zones
act
of
1990
exceeded
congress'
authority
under
the
commerce
clause.
several
significant
considerations
contributed
to
this
decision.
first,
the
act
was
a
criminal
statute
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
commerce
or
any
sort
of
economic
enterprise;
second,
the
act
contained
no
express
jurisdictional
element,
which
might
have
limited
its
reach
to
a
discrete
set
of
firearm
possessions
that
have
an
explicit
connection
with
or
effect
on
interstate
commerce;
third,
we
noted
that
the
act
was
not
supported
by
express
congressional
findings
regarding
the
effects
upon
interstate
commerce;
finally,
our
decision
in
lopez
rested
on
the
fact
that
the
causal
link
between
gun
possession
in
school
zone
and
interstate
commerce
was
extraordinarily
attenuated.
the
government
argued
that
gun
possession
may
ultimately
affect
interstate
commerce
because
violence
influences
travel
and
insurance
and
because
any
determent
education
may
ultimately
affect
national
productivity.
we
rejected
this
sort
of
house-that-jack-built
reasoning,
because
it
would
obliterate
the
constitution's
distinction
between
national
and
local
power.
with
these
principles
as
reference
points,
the
proper
resolution
of
the
present
case
is
clear.
gender
motivated
crimes
of
violence
are
not
in
any
sense
of
the
phrase
economic
activity.
like
the
gun-free
school
zones
act's
section
13981
contains
no
jurisdictional
element
establishing
that
the
federal
cause
of
action
is
in
pursuance
if
congress'
powered
regulate
interstate
commerce.
and
while
section
13981
is
supported
by
voluminous
congressional
findings
unlike
the
lopez
case,
regarding
the
impact
that
gender
motivated
violence
has
on
victims
in
their
families.
these
findings
are
substantially
weakened
by
the
fact
that
they
rely
on
the
very
method
of
reasoning
that
we
rejected
in
lopez.
this
reasoning
seeks
to
follow
the
but-for
causal
chain
from
the
initial
occurrence
of
violent
crime,
the
suppression
of
which
has
always
been
the
prime
object
of
the
state's
police
power
to
every
attenuated
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.
this
reasoning
would
give
congress
unlimited
police
power,
whereas
the
founders
granted
the
national
government
only
limited
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
we
accordingly
reject
the
argument
that
congress
may
regulate
non-economic
violent
criminal
conduct,
based
solely
on
that
conduct's
remote
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
petitioner's
fourteenth
amendment
argument
is
also
foreclosed
by
our
precedents.
shortly
after
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
we
decided
two
cases
interpreting
the
amendment's
provisions,
united
states
against
harris
and
the
civil
rights
cases.
in
those
cases
we
concluded
that
congress'
enforcement
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
limited
to
the
regulation
of
states
and
state
actors.
although,
petitioners
rely
on
dicta
from
several
subsequent
cases
in
arguing
that
section
5
grants
congress
authority
to
regulate
private
persons.
our
cases
have
never
departed
from
our
original
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
state
action
requirement,
because
section
13981
regulates
the
conduct
of
private
persons,
not
states
or
state
officials;
it
cannot
be
sustained
as
an
exercise
with
congress'
section
5
authority.
petitioner
brzonkala's
complaint
alleges
that
she
was
the
victim
of
a
brutal
assault.
if
the
allegations
are
true
no
civilized
system
of
justice
could
fail
to
provide
her
a
remedy
for
morrison's
conduct,
but
under
our
federal
system,
that
remedy
must
be
provided
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
not
by
the
united
states.
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.

thomas
has
filed
a
concurring

souter
