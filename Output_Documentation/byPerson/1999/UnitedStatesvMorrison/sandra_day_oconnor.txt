well,
presumably
congress
could
also,
under
your
theory
at
least,
legislate
in
those
areas
too.
if...
if
there's
bias
against
women
and
they're
not
receiving
adequate
alimony
or
it's
not
enforceable
in
court
in
the
states,
then
it
would
also
have
an
effect
on
commerce.
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
has
been
helped
many
times
by
finding
some
kind
of
jurisdictional
hook
that
the
conduct
that
took
place
was
carried
out
in...
in
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
such
hook
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
in
heart
of
atlanta,
you...
you
did
have
commercial
businesses,
the
running
of
motels
and
restaurants
and
so
forth--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your...
your
approach
seems
to
me
would
justify
a...
a
federal
remedy
for
alimony
or
child
support
or
other
things
of
that...
or
contract
disputes
because
we
now
have
a
record
that
there's
bias
in
state
courts
against
women.
so,
any
woman
entering
into
a
contract
perhaps
congress
could
say
should
have
remedies
in
federal
court,
and
under
your
theory
that
would
be
fine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has
made
findings
about
bias
against
women
in
state
courts.
