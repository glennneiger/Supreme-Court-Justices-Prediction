make
it
just
an
alternate
forum
as
here.
you
can
bring
your
property
distribution
claim
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
on
your
theory
congress,
i
suppose,
could
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
but
the
case
of
marital
distribution
would
also
be
based
on
discrimination,
that
is,
a
documented
legislative
history
that
shows
that
women
are
getting
the
short
end
of
the
stick
in
marital
property
distribution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
waxman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--from
what
you
say,
i
take
it
that
there
would
not
need
to
be
a
jurisdictional
peg
for
the
criminal
provisions
of
this
act.
there
is
in
fact,
but
am
i
correct
in
understanding
you
to
say
that
that
was
not
necessary?
proper
perhaps
but
not
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosman,
on
that
point,
you're
not
challenging,
are
you,
any
of
the
findings
that
congress
made
that
this
is,
indeed,
a
problem
that
affects
the
national
economy
because
it
impedes
women's
mobility,
it
impedes
the
jobs
that
they
can
take,
the
times
of
day
that
they
work?
you're
not
challenging
any
of
those
findings,
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosman,
can
we
return
to
gender
based
violence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
you
said,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
you're
willing
to
accept
the
findings
that
congress
made
that
this
does,
indeed,
deter
women's
full
participation
in
the
national
economy.
in
taking
a
look
at
what
congress
did
here,
they
didn't
do
the
things
that
this
congress
has
said
they
can.
they
didn't
commandeer
any
state
legislators.
they
did
not
displace
the
state
legal
system.
they
just
provided
an
alternate
remedy
in
an
alternate
forum.
now,
why
can't
congress
do
that
if
they
say,
here's
the
effect
on
commerce?
we're
not
taking
over
the
states'
domain.
we
are
just
complementing
what
the
states
do.
it's
another
auxiliary
action
just
as
giving
them
money
for
training
is
permitted.
why
isn't
that
satisfactory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
just
tell
me
what...
what
is
the
clash
here?
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
you're
in
a
state
that...
that
has
a
similar
statute,
then
there's
no
clash.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
just
like
the
federal
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
lay
aside
that
for
a
moment
and
take
this
case
that's
before
us.
there's
no
question
of
family
relationship
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosman,
can...
can
i
ask
why,
if
we
have
in
so
many
fields
involving
discrimination,
parallel
state
and
federal
regulation,
public
accommodations,
employment,
we
don't
say
that
that's
a
traditional
area
for
the
states
just
because
they
got
there
first,
which
they
did?
in
both
areas
there
was
state
legislation
before
federal.
so,
if
you
can
have
harmonious
legislation
for
public
accommodations,
for
employment,
then
why
not
here?
