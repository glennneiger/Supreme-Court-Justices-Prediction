mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
employer
may
not
require
an
employee
to
use
his
comp
time
against
his
wishes
unless
the
employee
has
agreed
to
that
arrangement
in
advance.
that
conclusion
follows
from
two
features
of
the
act.
first,
the
act
gives
the
employee
the
absolute
right
to
overtime
pay
in
cash.
an
employer
cannot
substitute
comp
time
for
overtime
pay
in
cash
unless
he
first
secures
the
employees'
agreement.
second,
the
act
makes
clear
that
comp
time
is
a
substitute
for
cash
pay.
an
employee
has
the
absolute
right
to
use
that
cash
pay
as
he
pleases.
the
employer
can't
tell
the
employee
when
or
how
it
may
be
spent.
just
as
the
control
over
cash
is
a
central
aspect
of
its
value,
control
over
the
use
of
comp
time
is
central
to
its
value,
and
therefore
the
secretary
has
reasonably
construed
the
act
to
permit
the
employee
to
use
the
comp
time
he
has
earned
as
he
wishes,
except
to
the
extent
he's
otherwise
agreed...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
secretary
has
construed
its...
her
regulations
to
provide
that
in
reliance
on
three
provisions
in
the
regulations.
first,
section
553.23(a)(1),
which
is
on
page
45a
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
provides,
just
as
i
explained
that
the
statute
did,
that
comp
time
is
a
substitute
for
overtime
payment
in
cash,
and
that
there
must
be
an
agreement
with
the
employee.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
secretary
is
also
relying
on
the
provision
in
(a)(2)
that
says
that
the
agreement
may
include
provisions
governing
the
use
of
comp
time.
that's
on
page
46a...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
first
sentence,
and
also
relying
on
(c)(1),
which
is
on
page
47.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
regulation
doesn't
require
that
it
address
that,
but
the
secretary
has
construed
the
regulation
as
a
whole
to
mean
that
if
it
doesn't
address
that,
then
the
employee
retains
the
right
to
use
comp
time...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
secretary
didn't
address
it
in
the
regulation,
but
did
address
it
in
the
opinion
letter,
which
provides
clarification
of
the
regulation...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
the
secretary's
interpretations.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
the
interpretation
of
the
regulation
is
entitled
to
stronger
deference
that
skidmore.
skidmore
was
decided...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
i
think
this
court
as
well,
recognized
a
difference
between
chevron-type
deference
or
the
kind
of
deference
in
our,
and
what
might
be
called
skidmore-type
deference,
which
is
that
the...
reasoned
judgment
is
entitled
to
respect
for
its
power
to
persuade
and...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
it
imposes
very
little
burden
on
the
employer.
the
employer
is
well-situated
to
obtain
the
employee's
agreement
to
that
condition,
and...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
employee
has
the
right
to
use
comp
time
within
a
reasonable
period
when
the
employee
requests
it,
unless
it
would
unduly
disrupt
the
employer's
operation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
employee
can
accrue
the
comp
time
so
that
the
employee
can
use
it
on
request,
as
provided
by
207(o)(5).
the
employee
also
could
accrue
it
up
to
the
maximum
provided
by
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
he
has
an
obligation
to
not...
he's
unable
to
use
it
on
request
if
it
would
unduly
disrupt
the
employer's
operation,
but...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
because
congress
did
not
expressly
address
the
situation
when
the...
if
the
employer
could
require
the
employee
to
use
comp
time.
i
submit
that
that's
because
congress
didn't
conceive
that
the
employer
would
assert
that
authority,
because
congress
understood
that
the
comp
time
belongs
to
the
employee,
and
that
the
employee
would
ask
when
to
use
it
and
not
be
told
when
to
use
it,
and
that
follows,
as
i
said,
from
the
features
of
the
act
that
i
described
earlier,
so
congress
didn't
have
a
need...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
but
once
that
ceiling
is
reached,
congress
specified
that
the
employee
would
have
to
be
paid
in
cash,
which
returns
the
employee
to
getting
his
basic
rate
under
the
act.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
congress
doesn't
say
you
can
pay
these
employees
comp
time.
it
says,
the
employees
have
the
right
to
overtime
pay
in
cash,
and
the
employees
may
agree
with
you
when
it's
mutually
beneficial
to
get
comp
time,
and
those
mutually
beneficial
arrangements
may
save
the
employer
money,
but
congress
was
very
clear,
the
statute
is
absolutely
clear,
the
employee
has
the
right
to
overtime
pay
in
cash.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
they
bank
it,
they
get...
they
can
accumulate
under
the
240
or
480
hours,
and
on
termination
of
employment
they
have
to...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
get
paid...
you
might
get
paid
more,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
worth
more
20
years
down
the
road.
you
would
get
paid
at
the
rate
then.
it's
unlikely...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
at
the
rate
for
your
rank
then,
or
the
last
3
years.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor
but...
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
know
whether
they
do.
there's
no
indication
in
this
case
that
these
employees
wanted
to
do
that.
another
feature
of
their
complaint,
which
wasn't
pursued
on
appeal,
was
that
they
were
not
being
allowed
to
use
comp
time
when
they
requested
to
do
so,
so
it
suggests
that
they
did
request
to
use
comp
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
you
could
look
at
it
that
way.
the
reason
that
the
default
isn't
that
the
employer
sets
the
work
rules
is
that
congress
has
displaced
that
principle
that
the
employer
can
set
the
rules
in
the
act
by
making...
by
giving
the
employee
the
right
to
overtime
and
by
providing
that
the
employer
can
only
have
a
comp
time
arrangement
pursuant
to
the
employee's
consent.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
that's
the
issue,
and
it
is
simply
a
default
rule.
the
parties...
everyone
agrees
the
parties
can
contract
out
of
that
principle,
so
it's
not
imposing
an
onerous
burden
on
the
employer,
and
what
it
is
doing
is
furthering
the
underlying
scheme
in
the
act.
