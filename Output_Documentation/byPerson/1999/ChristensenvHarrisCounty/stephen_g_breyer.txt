justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that,
because
i
thought
that
everybody
agrees
if
the
employee
knowingly
and
voluntarily
agreed
to
the
understanding...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
issue,
then
everybody
agrees
that
then
the
county
would
win,
and
i
think
everybody...
then
the
issue
is
here,
though,
on
the
assumption
that
they
didn't
knowingly
and
voluntarily
agree,
and
is
there
now
a
question
in
the
case
about
that
so
that
we
should
send
it
back,
or...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
would
it...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
these
materials?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
look
at
the
petition
for...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where
would
i...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
did
that
letter
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
these
employees
don't
know
that
the
county
thinks
they
have
to
use...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
must
be...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to...
i
may
have
to...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
doesn't
get
you
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
still...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to...
i
may
be
misremembering
this,
but
i
can't...
let's
just
ask
you
that
even
if
it's
not
a
formal
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
which
i
could
see
how
it
would
be,
what
it
means
to
say
you
can
put
extra
conditions
there,
in
terms
of
the...
a
background
rule
where
nobody
says
anything.
i
could
understand
that,
but
even
if
not,
isn't
there
a
famous
administrative
law
case,
skidmore,
which
talks
about
this
court
paying
deference
to
a
wage
and
hour
administrator
on
the
ground
that
even
if
he
lacks...
he
possesses
the
power
to
persuade
even
though
he
lacks
the
power
to
control?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
never
knew
there
was
a
difference
of
deference.
i
never
was
able
to
measure
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
all
we're
talking
about
is,
what
is
the
background
rule
if,
in
fact,
nobody
puts
a
condition
in
the
agreement?
now,
they're
free
to
put
it
in
or
not,
but
what's
the
background
rule,
which
is
a
pretty
sort
of
interstitial
minor
point,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
decide
to
bank
it
and
never
spend
it,
and
the
employer
would
like
them
to,
and
eventually
get
cash
for
it,
when
do
they
get
the
cash,
when
they
retire?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
termination
of
employment,
so
it's
quite
possible
that...
it
would
be
an
unusual
case
where
they'd
want
to
bank
it.
i
mean,
if
you
refuse
it
you
get
paid
time
and
a
half
next
month,
and
if
you
decide
to
take
the
comp
time
and
save
it,
you're
going
to
be
paid
when
you
retire.
do
you
get
paid
more
when
you
retire?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
must
not
make
decisions
based
on
these
prospective
calculation
of
what
it's
worth
years
down
the
road,
or
maybe
they
do,
do
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
don't
you
put
it
in
an
agreement?
i
mean,
you
know...
that's
what
i
don't
understand,
is
why
is
this
case
such
a
big
deal,
since
everybody
agrees
you
should
be
able
to
do
that,
but
you
have
to
get
your
employees'
agreement
to
it,
just
as
you'd
have
to
to
get
his
agreement
to
comp
time
in
the
first
place,
and
so
you
have
to
get
that
agreement
anyway.
what's
the
big
deal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides,
which
there
are,
you
could
have
a
background
rule
either
way.
the
reg,
i
agree
with
you,
doesn't
say
much
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
why
not
just
go
with
the
agency?
i
mean,
that's
a...
why...
you
know,
trivial
matter,
interstitial,
background
agreement,
they
have
the
experience,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
sort
of
where
i...
what
i'm
thinking
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
symmetry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
basically
the
statute
says,
we
prefer
money.
you
work
overtime,
we'll
give
you
money.
now,
you
work
overtime,
you
get
the
money.
now,
if
you
agree
to
take
the
comp
time,
that's
fine,
and
that
kind
of
idea,
that
it's
money
or
you
get
their
agreement...
it
says
its
money
and
they
get
their
agreement,
they
get
the
comp
time.
it
says
it's
money,
or
you
get
the
agreement
if
you
want
to
force
them
to
take
the
comp
time
rather
than
wait
till
the
end
and
get
the
cash,
all
right.
i
mean,
it's
symmetry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
most
of
them
don't,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
i
mean,
why
are
they
going
to
wait
around
for
20
years
and
cashing
it
out,
instead
of...
don't
most
of
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
know
any
facts
here,
by
the
way,
what
actually
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other...
sorry.
did
you
want
to
answer
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
told...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
pardon
me?
