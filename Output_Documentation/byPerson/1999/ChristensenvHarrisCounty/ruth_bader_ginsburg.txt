justice

was
there
any
allegation
by
the
employer
that
there
was
anything
other
than
an
agreement
that
there
would
be
comp
time?
there
wasn't
any
allegation
that
any
of
this
was
fleshed
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
would
a
trial
court
have
to
make
such
a
determination
if
the
employer
is
not
alleging
anything
more
than
we
had
an
understanding,
they
knew
when
they
took
the
job
that
it
was
going
to
be
comp
time
instead
of
overtime
pay,
and
we
didn't...
we're
not
alleging
that
we
spelled
out
the
details
of
it.
we're
not
alleging
that
they
specifically
consented
to
this...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
compelled
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
does
it
come
down
to
whether
the
default
rule
is,
you
get
overtime,
or
the
default
is,
as
judge
hickinbotham
said,
the
employer
sets
the
work
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is,
how
detailed
the
consent
must
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
the
comp
time,
or
the
working
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
and
now
in
this
court
everybody
agreed
that
there
can
be
an
understanding.
we're
talking
about
what
notice
the
employees
have
to
be
given,
so
there's
no
question
that
from
now
on
harris
county
can
say,
this
is
the
deal,
employees.
the
only
question
is
when
they
didn't
say
that,
when
all
they
said
was
comp
time,
what
should
be
the
consequences?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
the
it?
i
mean,
certainly
you
can't
substitute
comp
time
for
overtime
pay
except
by
agreement
or
understanding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
must
have
an
agreement
to
comp
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
question
is,
what
are
the
terms
and
conditions
of
that
comp
time?
one
we
know
from
the
statute,
that
the
employee
can
request
it,
and
the
employer
has
to
accommodate
unless
the
time
that
is
being
sought
would
unduly
disrupt...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
operations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
have
that
one
condition
on
it
directly
out
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why,
if
congress
is
trying
to
say,
employees,
it's
your
option,
or
at
least
you
have
to
be
given
notice,
why
shouldn't
that
notice
be,
here
it
is,
and
at
a
certain
point
you're
going
to
have
to
take
it?
why
shouldn't
that
be
spelled
out,
instead
of
the
employee
thinking,
well,
this
is
fine.
if
i
need
it,
i'll
use
it,
and
if
i
don't
need
it,
i'll
bank
it,
and
the
statute
says
after
x
number
of
hours
i
get
paid
in
cash.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
protects
the
employer
against
excessive
accumulations.
the
employer
can
always
say,
well,
the
main
rule
is
time-and-a-half
pay.
here's
your
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then,
if
you
look
at
it
as
the
comp
time
being
an
exception
to
the
overtime
pay,
then
it
would
be
logical
to
say
the
employer
can
go
back
to
what
is
the
main
rule,
what
is
the
rule
in
workplaces
that
are
not
public.
there's
no
comp
time
option
in
the
private
sector,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
underlying
premise
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is,
you
pay
time
and
a
half.
then
there's
an
exception
that
operates
only
in
the
public
sector,
but
congress
has
provided
that
the
employer
can
always
do
what
employers
all
over
the
country
must
do.
that
is,
pay
time
and
a
half.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
i
mean
by
cashing
them
out,
by...
instead
of
letting
them
accumulate
the
time,
giving
them
the
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
doesn't
that
just
underscore
that
the
default
rule
should
be,
you
pay
them,
not,
you
set
the
work
rules
any
way
you
like?
i
mean,
the
statute
says,
there's
an
exception,
but
the
main
rule
is
time
and
a
half.
if
the
main
rule
is
time
and
a
half,
then
it's
perfectly
logical
for
the
statute
to
say,
you
can...
employer,
you
can
always
pay
time
and
a
half.
you
can
do
the
other
if
the
employees
agree
to
it,
but
you
can
always
go
down
to
the
bedrock
rule
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
is
time
and
a
half.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
cash
out
the
credits
at
any
time,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
it
does
suggest
to
me
that
this
is
a
statute
where
the
main
rule
is
time
and
a
half,
but
you
have
an
exception.
usually
we
construe
exceptions
narrowly,
not
broadly,
and
if
congress'
idea
is,
let
the
workers
know
what
you're
doing,
then
it's
just
a
question
of
notice,
and
you
didn't
give
them
notice
of
anything
other
than
you
were
going
to
install
comp
time.
you
didn't
give
them
any
notice
that,
quite
contrary
to
what
the
statute
indicates,
that
is,
they
may
request
it
and
the
employer
has
to
give
it
to
them
if
it
won't
unduly
disrupt.
it
just
doesn't
seem...
the
statute
doesn't
seem
to
have
space
for
a
rule
that
says,
and
without
prior
notice
you
can
require
them
to
take
it.
