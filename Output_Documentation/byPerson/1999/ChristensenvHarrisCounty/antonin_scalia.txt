agreement
or
understanding,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
understanding,
in
terms
of
our
understanding
come
in
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
we
know
whether
this
is
the
case?
how
many
of
these
people
were
hired
after
this
policy
was
already
in
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
certainly,
as
to
any
plaintiffs
who
were
hired
after
1992
or
'93,
if
the
department
said
this
is
going
to
be
our
program,
and
they
took
the
job,
would
that
qualify
as
an
agreement
or
understanding?
justice
antonin
scalia
clearly
communicated
when
they
accepted
the
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
didn't,
do
you
think
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation...
when
the
employer
says,
you're
not
going
to
get
overtime,
you're
going
to
get
comp
time,
do
you
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
is
that
i
can
sit
on
my
comp
time,
refuse
to
use
it
until
i
finally
retire,
and
then
cash
it
in...
justice
antonin
scalia
at
time
and
a
half?
you
think
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation...
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
employer
says,
what
you're
going
to
get
is
comp
time,
and
my
follow-up
question
is,
do
you
think
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
statute...
justice
antonin
scalia
which
says
you
can
give
an
employee
comp
time
instead
of
overtime,
that
it
means
the
employee
can
sit
on
the
comp
time
until
he
retires
and
then
cash
it
in
for
overtime
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
i
understood
the
statute,
it
was
enacted
in
response
to
the
complaint
of
the
states
that
now
that
you're
applying
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
us
we're
going
to
go
bankrupt.
we
cannot
pay
time
and
a
half
to
firemen,
policemen
and
so
forth.
so
congress
said,
well,
okay,
if
you
want
you
can
give
them
comp
time
instead
of
time
and
a
half.
but
what
you're
urging
here,
to
wit,
that
the
policemen
and
firemen
can
simply
refuse
to
use
the
comp
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
get
it
in
cash.
it
just
makes...
it
just
makes
nothing
of
the
concession
that
congress
made
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is
that
letter
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
labor
department?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
administrator...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
firing
is
not
coercion?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
you
can
fire
him,
but
i
can't
reduce
your
hours
to
35?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
possible.
if
it
says
that,
i
don't
call
that
making
sense
out
of
it.
you
can
fire
him,
but
you
can't
reduce
his
hours...
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
says
there
has
to
be
an
agreement
before
you
can
use
comp
time.
it
doesn't
say
what
the
consequence
of
using
comp
time
is.
i
mean,
it
just
says
there
has
to
be
an
agreement
before
you
can
use
comp
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
do
(a)(2)
first.
an
agreement
may
contain
other
things.
it
doesn't
say
it
must
contain
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
regulation
could
have
said
that.
any
other
things...
you
know,
any
other
conditions
on
comp
time
must
be
included
in
an
agreement.
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
excuse
me.
i
thought
he
doesn't
have
to
use
it
within
a
reasonable
time.
i
thought
the
position
here
is
that
he
can
sit
on
it
and
choose
not
to
use
it
as
he
wishes,
and
cash
it
in
at
the
end
of
his
career?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
no
obligation
to
be
reasonable
in
his
use
of
it
at
all,
isn't
that
right?
i
thought
that's
what
we're
arguing
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
i
don't
understand,
mr.
roberts,
is
what
good
it
does
for
congress
to
say,
you
don't
have
to
pay
these
people
cash.
you
can
let
them
have
comp
time
instead.
i
don't
see
what
good
that
does
if
congress
also
says,
oh,
and
by
the
way,
the
employees
don't
have
to
use
this
comp
time.
they
can
just
sit
on
it
and
bank
it,
and
cash
it
in
at
the
end
of
their
careers.
what
has
congress
accomplished?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
at
the
rate
for
your
rank
then,
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
a
captain
then
you'd
get
a
captain's
240
hours,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
the
employee
normally
has
a
40-hour
week,
say,
you
just
come
in
35
hours
this
week,
i'll
pay
you
for
40,
right,
and
the
other
5
will
be
paying
down
your
comp
time,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what's
the
big
deal,
then?
why
do
we
have
this
case
in
front
of
us?
why
don't
they
just
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
you
did
here?
i
am
in
some
perplexity.
i
thought
your
opponent
had
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
okay
for
the
employer
just
to
say,
next
week
only
come
in
35
hours,
and
for
the
employer
to
take
the
money
that
it
saves,
the
5
hours,
add
a
little
bit
more
to
it
for
the
time
and
a
half,
and
voluntarily,
as
it's
entitled
to
do,
buy
out
5
hours
worth
of
the
comp
time.
now,
is
it
common
ground
that
that
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you're
doing
something
a
little
different.
you're
saying,
don't
come
in
next
week,
take
your
comp
time
instead.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
little
different
from
saying...
you're
directing
them
to
take
their
comp
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means,
you
know,
they
won't
get
any...
well,
they'll
get
their
regular
pay,
and
they'll
have
time
and
a
half
off,
i
guess,
right?
is
that
how
it
comes?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
bit
different
from
simply
saying,
look
at...
god,
you've
got
240
hours
here.
i
can't
afford
that.
don't
come
in
for
5
hours
next
week.
say
nothing
else
about
the
comp
time,
and
then
the
employer
just
buys
off
5
hours
worth
of
comp
time.
that's
a
little
different,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
other
side
says
that
that's
bad.
that's
not
what
you've
done
here,
though.
you've
instructed
them
to
take
their
comp
time.
isn't
that
the
facts
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
do
it
the
other
way,
and
save
us
all
this
trouble?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
do
that,
can
he?
doesn't
the
employer
have
a
right
to
buy
out
the
comp
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
even
as
substantial
as
that.
you
could,
on
an
irregular
basis,
say
we
have
so
many...
so
few
processes
to
serve
next
week,
you
know,
jones,
take
next
wednesday
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
and
then
make
the
decision
to
pay
jones...
pay
jones'
comp
time
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't...
it
really
doesn't...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
and
that
leaves
me
in
something
of
a
quandary,
whether
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
means
that
we
should
find
for
your
opponent,
because
you
can
do
what
you
want
to
do
anyway
very
easily,
or
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
should
make
me
wonder
why
it
should
be
prohibited
to
do
it
the
more
honest
way
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
why...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
which
resolution
that
leaves
you
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
an
unknown
phenomenon
in
the
federal
service
for
some
people
to
save
up
sick
time,
which
they're
entitled
to
be
compensated
for
at
the
end
of
their
service,
and
it
was
not
an
unheard-of
practice
for
people
to
save
up
vacation
time,
which
is
why
some
employers
require
you
to
take
your
vacation,
because
people
would
work
the
whole
year
and
then,
you
know,
save
up
all
their
vacation
time,
retire
a
year
earlier.
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
fanciful
to
think
that
people
would
bank
this
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
require...
i
mean,
you
require
them
to
give
you
a
slip
of
paper
saying,
i
choose
to
take
my
comp
time,
or
something
like
that?
no?
you
just
say,
you
are
taking
your
comp
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
don't
do
it,
then
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
based
on
the
contract,
okay.
