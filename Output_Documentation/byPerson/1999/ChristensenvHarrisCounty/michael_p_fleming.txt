mr.
michael
p.
fleming
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
reason,
or
the
main
reason
on
why
there
aren't
any
regulations
that
address
this
issue,
and
there
really
aren't,
is
because
of
the...
what's
really
taking
place
in
this,
what's
been
termed
a
forced
use
of
compensatory
time.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
basically
provides
for
a
minimum
wage
rate
and
maximum
number
of
hours.
there's
no
provision
in
there
that
guarantees
a
40-hour
week,
work
week.
an
employer
is
always
free
to
cut
the
work
week
short,
to
have
an
employee
work
30
hours,
20
hours,
10
hours,
1
hour,
and
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
there's
a
very
specific
provision
that
allows
employers
to
cash
out
accrued
compensatory
time
at
any
time.
it's
in
the
statute
and
more
specifically
in
the
regulations.
now,
if
they
could
do
each
of
those
two
separately,
there's
nothing
that
prevents
a
public
employer
from
doing
so
simultaneously
to
achieve
the
objectives
which
were
set
out
in
the
amendments
following
the
garcia
decision,
that
is,
to
protect
the
county's
resources
and
budgets
and
really,
in
this
situation,
to
protect
against
employees
that
do
bank
their
comp
time
and
hold
it
to
the
maximum.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
in
fact...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that's
what
we
do.
what
happens
is
that
they'll...
after
the
supervisor
tries
to
reach
an
agreeable
time
for
the
employee
to
start
taking
time
off
and
getting
paid
in
cash
from
their
compensatory
time
that's
been
accumulated,
if
the
employee
doesn't
do
it,
then
he
meets
with
him
and
orders
him
to
do
it,
and
still
tries
to
get
a
reasonable
period
of
time
when
they
can
do
it,
and
if
not,
then
issues
an
order
for
the
employee
to
do
it.
and
what
will
happen
is,
for
instance,
if
it's
a
week
the
employee
is
going
to
take
off,
the
employee
doesn't
come
in
to
work
that
week
but
he
still
gets
his
paycheck,
40
hours
of
pay,
and
mind
you,
that
pay
has
been
accumulated
at
time
and
a
half,
so
they're
still
getting
the
benefit
of
the
time-and-a-half
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
that's
what
the
practice
is,
and
that's
what
happens.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
i
think...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
sure.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
well...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
well...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that's
a
good
question,
and
in
addition
to
the
default
rule,
which
judge
hickinbotham
of
the
fifth
circuit
said,
where
he
sort
of
filled
in
the
gaps
of
what
he
perceived
the
agreement
would
be,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
under
the
statute
we
don't
have
to
have
an
agreement,
is
our
position,
really
how
the
case
evolved,
though,
is
up
until
we
got
to
this
court
the
petitioner
was
saying
that
it's
completely
prohibited
by
the
act,
agreement
or
no
agreement,
and
it
was
our
position
that
it's...
we're
allowed
to
do
it
by
the
act,
and
that's
still
our
position.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
well,
we
agreed
that
we
could
do
it
by
agreement,
but
it's
our
position
we
don't
have
to
do
it
by
agreement,
and
whether
we
want
to
go
back
and
issue
a
new...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that's...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
which
we
have.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree
that
it
can
be
in
an
agreement,
certainly.
but
just
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
that
there
are
workplace
rules
which
the
employee
governs,
in
this
case,
this
is
something
that
is
outside
of
the
act.
they
could
be...
setting
the
number
of
hours
below
40
is
not
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
the
employer
is
not
required
to
enter
negotiations
with
the
employees
on
when
they're
going
to
set
those
hours
or
cut
them
back.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
i
don't
know
if...
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
petitioners
are
maintaining.
that's
our
position.
we're
telling
them,
don't
come
in
next
week,
or,
you
know,
in
a
couple
of
weeks...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that's
what...
as
we
have
maintained,
we're
doing
two
things,
and
they...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
i
mean,
they've
accrued
the
comp
time
for
time
and
a
half,
and...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
but
by
doing
it,
it's
in
two
phases.
i
agree
that
it's
a
forced
use,
but
as
far
as
finding
a
statutory
authority
for
doing
it,
it's
the
way
i
explained.
there's
nothing
that
can
stop
us
from
shortening
the
work
week,
and
we
can
cash
out
the
comp
time
at
any
time
without
any
restrictions.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
you
mean...
if
i
understand
your
question...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
the
employer
has
a
right
to
buy
out
the
comp
time.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
no,
because
we
can
cash
it
out.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that's...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
i
don't
think
that
they're
saying
that
they
can
refuse
to
take
the
payment,
because
the
statute
and
the
regulations
are
very
clear
about
that,
cash
them
out
at
any
time,
and
so
if
we
can
do
either
of
those
separately,
we
can
do
them
simultaneously.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
we
can
cash
them
out.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
the
employer
can
cash
out
at
any
time.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
no.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
pay
time
and
a
half,
or
we
can
cash
them
out.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
as
they...
as
they're
accumulating
it,
if
we...
when
they
reach
the
240
hours,
if
they
do,
if
we
don't
cash
them
out
they're
going
to
get
time
and
a
half.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that's
right.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
if
we
did
it
each
week,
we
could.
we
don't
do
it
each
week,
though.
i
mean,
they
wait
till
it
gets
up
to
near
the
maximum
of
240
hours
in
our
case,
and
then
they
try
and
get
it
to
come
down
a
little
bit,
so
they're
not
cutting
back
their
time
every
week.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
cashing
out
is
if
an
employee
has
some
accrued
compensatory
hours,
whether
it's
1
hour
or
240
hours,
that
the
employer
can
pay
for
those
hours
in...
at
the...
whatever
rate
the
employee
has
at
that
time,
or...
and
they
can
also
do
it
when
the
employee
leaves
or
is
terminated,
and
they
pay
it
out
dollar
for
dollar
based
on
the
number
of
hours.
now,
the
hours
have
been
accumulated
at
time
and
a
half.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
no,
there's
not.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
i
don't
want
to
state
the
petitioner's
position,
but...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
well...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
if
jones
didn't
have
any
accrued
compensatory
hours
we
could
do
that.
he
gets
nothing.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
well...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
see,
justice
scalia,
in
looking
at
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
there's
nothing
in
there
that
prohibits
us
from
doing
this.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
well,
it's
symmetry...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
it's
symmetry,
but
if
you
go
back
to
what
justice
scalia
said
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
argument,
was
that
the
purpose
of
these
amendments
in
the
first
place
was
to
help
out
the
governmental
entities
so
they
can
manage
their
budgets
and
wouldn't
have
to
pay
this
overtime
in
cash,
and
it
was
expected
that
the
employees
would
use
the
compensatory
time,
and
not
expected
that
they
would
bank
it...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
well,
if
they
don't
do
it...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
okay,
and
we
get
to
the
position
where
they're
reaching
the
maximum
level
and
the
government's
going
to
have
to
start
paying
time
and
a
half
in
cash,
then
a
fair
reading
of
the...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
there's
nothing
in
the
stipulation,
which
is
basically
the
record,
as
to
exactly
how
many
this
occurred
would
amount
to
the...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
oh,
i
agree
that...
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
see
that
people
will
do
it,
but
under
the
act
and
the
'85
amendments
it
was
expected
that
people
were
going
to
use
it,
and
that
was
their
concern,
is
that
the
employees
have
the
time,
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
makes
sure
that
people
aren't
overworked,
without
getting
paid
time
and
a
half
for
it.
it's
not
to
make
sure
they
get
to
work
40
hours.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
they're
told
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that
is
how
we're
doing
it.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
that
is
how
we
were
doing
it.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
and
30's
just
an
example,
but
it's,
they're
going
to
take
the
time
off...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
and
then
we're
going
to
cash
you
out
under
the
act,
some
of
your
hours,
to
make
sure
you
get
a
full
paycheck.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
they
get
the
same
paycheck,
but
they
haven't
had...
they've
got...
the
hours
that
are
cashed
out
they
accumulated
at
time
and
a
half
anyway,
so
that
it's
for
a
less
amount
of
work,
so
they
do
get
the
same
pay.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
they
are
asked
to
start
reducing
it
voluntarily.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
just
under
the
stipulation.
if
they...
and
within
a
reasonable
time.
if
they
don't
do
it...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
then
the
supervisor
can
order
them
to
do
it,
and
try
and...
and
still
work
with
them
to
try
to
reach
mutually
agreeable
times,
but
the
effect
is
an
order
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
no,
just
as
to
the
sheriff's
department,
which
is
the
defendant
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
the
county
is
a
defendant
as
a
result
of
the
sheriff's
department.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
the
cap,
i
believe,
is
for
those
employers
that
just
don't...
can't
or
won't
let
the
employees
take
the
time
off,
and
i
think
the
concerns
when
these
enactments
of
'85
went
into
effect
was
that
the
employees
are
able
to
use
the
time,
are
able
to
take
the
time
off.
on
the
other
side...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
it's
a
balancing.
an
employee's
protection
is
this,
is
that
in
the
statute,
as
was
mentioned,
the
employee
is
allowed
to
use
it
within
a
reasonable
time
if
there
isn't
an
undue
disruption,
and
so
the
focus
there
is
on
the
employee's
ability
to
use
the
time.
on
the
other
side,
the
employer's
controls
over
this,
since
it
is
a
balance,
is
the
employer's
ability
to
cash
them
out.
and
i
might
add
that
on
the
ability
of
the
employers
to
cash
them
out,
it's
an
important
distinction,
because
it
is...
that
division
gives
the
employers
control,
and
the
petitioners
have
maintained
well,
this
comp
time
accumulation
is
under
the
sole
control
of
the
employees,
and
there
certainly
would
be
circumstances
where
the
employers
would
choose
to
cash
out
the
comp
time,
and
it
would
be
contrary
to
what
the
employees
wished
to
do,
such
as
if
they
wanted
to
stop
them
from
using
it
at
a
certain
time
of
the
year,
or
if
there
had
been
an
increase,
county-wide
budget
increase
in
pay,
the
employer,
the
department
could
cash
them
out
before
that
goes
into
effect.
that
hasn't
been
done
in
this
case,
but
in...
that
certainly
reflects
that
the
act
provides
the
employer
with
a
certain
degree
of
control
over
these
comp
time
hours,
and
it's
not
within
the
sole
discretion
of...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
they
could,
once
they
go
over
the
240.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct,
you
could
do
that.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
it
doesn't,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary,
because
i
don't
think
that
scheduling
less
than
40
hours
a
week
is
within
the
purview
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
cashing
them
out
at
any
time
is,
specifically,
and
so
when
we
have
the
comp
time
agreement,
which
we
have
with
the
employees,
it's
to
use
the
comp
time,
and
then
it's
in
accordance
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
it
says,
and
so
if
we
do
that,
though,
within
the
fair
labor
standards
act
we
can
cash
them
out.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
no,
i...
yes,
i
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
absolutely.
on
the
deference
issue,
which
was
raised
briefly
by
the
opposing
counsel,
i
would
just
say
this.
the
main
case,
of
course,
is
chevron,
and
the
standard
is
if
congress
has
not
directly
spoke
on
the
precise
question...
excuse
me.
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear,
it's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
i
think
the
intent
is
clear,
if
you
look
at
what
we're
doing.
shortening
the
work
week
is
not
within
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
cashing
them
out
is.
clearly,
we
can
do
it.
and
as
far
as
whether
you
use
chevron
or
you
use
skidmore,
skidmore
certainly
is
a
lesser
standard,
but
you
can
see
in
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
it
cites
skidmore
as
to...
that
the
regulation...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
then
i
think
that
they
would
be
bound
by
contract
law
for
that.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
but
their
right
would
not
arise
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
it
would
be
under
the
contract.
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
yes,
your
honor.
well...
mr.
michael
p.
fleming
i
was
going
to
invite
some
more
questions,
but
i
will...
if
there
aren't
any
more
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
just
stop
there.
thank
you.
