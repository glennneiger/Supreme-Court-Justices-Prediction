justice
john
paul
stevens
enlighten
me
about
what
you
mean
by
saying
paying
in
comp
time
instead
of
cash.
if
they
take
comp
time,
don't
they
get
paid
in
cash
for
the
time
they
don't
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he...
of
course,
as
the
employer
used
his
comp
time
a
year
later
and
the
wage
rate's
gone
up,
the
time
he
uses
the
comp
time
he
will
stay
home
and
get
paid
at
the
rate...
then
current
rate,
will
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
the
meantime
the
employer's
had
the
use
of
the
money,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
roberts,
what's
the
opposite
rule?
if
the
employer
can't
decide
when
it's
used,
does
the
employee
have
the
right
to
say,
well,
i've
decided
to
take
it
whenever
i
choose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
cut
against...
i'm
just
trying
to
think
it
through.
doesn't
that
in
a
way
cut
against
you,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
restraint
on
the
ability
of
the
employee
to
use
it
whenever
he
wants
to.
he
can't
just
say
on
friday
i'm
going
to
take
off
next
monday
and
tuesday.
he
must
consider
the
employer's
wishes,
but
there's
no
restraint
on
the
employer's
imposing,
under
the
regulation,
his
desires
on
how
it
should
be
used,
no
express
restraint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
congress
did
impose
a
ceiling
on
how
much
comp
time
that
could
be
accumulated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
issue.
you
can
make
him
work
30
hours
a
week,
but
the
question
is,
can
he
refuse
to
be
paid
for
40?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
position
is,
he
can
say
i
don't
want
to
take
the
10
hours
in
cash,
i
want
to
keep
it
in
the
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
confess
to
total
stupidity
here,
because
if
you've
got
your
30-hour-a-week
example,
you
say
you
have
an
absolute
right,
and
they
don't
contest
the
fact
you
can
pay
them
for
the
extra
10
hours
if
you
want
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
exactly
does...
then
why
aren't
you
doing
that?
i
don't
understand
why
that
isn't...
what
you're
fighting
about,
if
everybody
agrees
you
can
do
that.
isn't
that
just
making
them
take
10
hours
of
comp
time
each
week?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
explain
something
else
to
me?
i
think
we
understand
now
the
30-hour...
you
can
make
them
work
30
hours
a
week,
and
pay
them
the
extra
10
even
if
they
don't
want
that.
how
is
it
that
you
are
in
fact
compelling
them
to
use
their
comp
time
if
it's
not
by
that
example?
what
do
you
do
to
them
when
they
get
220
hours,
and
they're
getting
close
to
240?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you...
what
is
the
arrangement
which
makes
the
expend
their
comp
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
make
them
work
30
hours
a
week
instead
of
40?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it
be
complicated...
i
understand
you
don't
have
that,
but
supposing
your
employees
all
had
a
contract
that
we'll
work
40
hours
a
week.
then
what
would
you
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
couldn't...
then
you
could
not
compel
them
to
take
the
contract...
