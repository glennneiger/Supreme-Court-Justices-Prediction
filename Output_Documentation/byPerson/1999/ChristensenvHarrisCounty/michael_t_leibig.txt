mr.
michael
t.
leibig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
july
1992
the
county
council,
attorney
for
harris
county,
texas
wrote
to
the
department
of
labor
and
asked,
while
it
is
clear
that
the...
i'm
quoting
from
their
letter
to
the
county
manager,
to
the
department
of
labor,
and
they
asked
whether...
while
it
was
clear
that
the
sheriff
may
authorize
an
employee
to
use
comp
time
when
he
requests
to
use
it,
that
the
regulations
and
the
statute
did
not
make
clear
whether
an
employer
could
compel
an
employee
to
use
compensatory
time
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
when
the
employee
did
not
want
to
use
it,
and
they
asked
for
an
opinion
from
the
department
of
labor
as
to
whether,
under
the
regulations
and
the
statute,
that
would
be
allowed,
and
the
department
of
labor
answered
that
on
september
14,
1992
that
absent
an
agreement
that
was
willingly
accepted
by
the
employees,
an
employer
could
not
compel
the
use
of
comp
time
under
the
fair
labor...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i'm
sorry...
agree...
yes.
agreement...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it
says
agreement
or
understanding,
and
also...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
there's...
in
the
record
in
this
case
it's
not
clear
when
the
parties
came
in
effect.
it
came
into
effect
sometime
between
1992
and
1993.
most
of
the
plaintiffs
were
working
then.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it
might,
and
i'll
explain
how,
but
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
that
was
a...
clearly
communicated
to
the
employees
and
the
employees
accepted
it
when
it
was
communicated.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
this
case...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
this
case
the
facts
are...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
excuse
me.
in
this
case
the
facts
are
that
there
was
a
county
regulation
saying
that
comp
time
would
be
used,
but
it
did
not
include
an
agreement
with
regard
to
compelled
use.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right,
but
under
the
regulations
and
the
statute,
and
this
is
in
section
207(o)
itself,
it
says
the...
and
in
the
regulation,
it
says
that
compensatory
time
off
in
lieu
of
cash
may
be
used,
and
may
be
a
condition
of
employment.
there's
a
specific
reference
to
the
regulations
that
could
make
it
a
condition
of
employment,
which
i
think
is
the
question,
but
it
says
so
long
as
the
comp
time
agreement
is
pursuant...
is
with
the
individual
employees
and
pursuant
to
their
knowing
and
under...
knowing
and
voluntary
acceptance
of
it.
so,
for
example,
in
your
accept...
in
your
example,
i
could
come...
you
could
say,
i
want
you
to
come
to
work
with
me
for
$10,
which
you
unilaterally
decided,
and
i
could
accept
that,
and
i
would
be
knowingly,
voluntarily
accepting
it.
on
the
other
hand,
you
could
offer
me
the
job
and
i
could
say,
no,
i
want
$15,
and
you
could
say,
well
then,
you're
not
hired,
but
you
could
also
say,
then
you
are
hired,
and
then
we'd
have
a
bilaterally
determined
condition
of
employment,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
regulations,
while
the
regulations
are
clear
that
it
could
be
a
condition
of
employment,
they're
also
clear
that
it
can
only
be
a
condition
of
employment
so
long
as
it
is
accepted
by
the
employees
knowing
in
advance
what
the
rules
on
preservation...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
but
at
least
there
has
to
be...
which
there's
not
in
this
case...
a
clear
enunciation
first
how
the
comp
time
will
be
preserved
and
used,
and
that
the
employer
would
have
the
authority
to
compel
it,
which
didn't
exist
in
this
case.
there
would
be
comp
time,
but
there
was
no...
nothing
in
the
record,
and
there
wasn't
anything
that
said,
we
can
compel
use.
they
adopted
a...
they...
it
says
a
practice
in
the
stipulation,
but
it
means
a
policy
of
compelling
use,
but
that
wasn't
in
the
regulation
that
estopped...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
think...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
the
suggestion
of
judge
dennis
in
the
dissent...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
the
fifth
circuit
was
exactly
that.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
is
send
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
in...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
consistent
with
the
department
of
labor
rules.
that's
what
we've
asked
for
in
the
complaint.
obviously,
we
could
have
asked
for,
to
overturn
the
court
of
appeals
and
uphold
the
trial
court,
but
the
trial
court
did
not
make
findings
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
an
agreement
existed
and
what
the
agreement
was,
therefore
that's
not
in
the
record,
and
if
you
want
to
make
it
a
condition
of
employment,
first
of
all
you
have
to
have
exactly
what
the
agreement
was
and,
secondly,
that
the
employees
knowingly
and
willingly
accepted
it.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
in
fact,
the
employer,
both
in
the
answer
to
the
amended
complaint
and
the
stipulation,
it's
clear,
and
in
their
brief,
they
don't
claim
that
there
was
a
specific
provision
on
compelled
use,
and
there
wasn't.
i
mean,
in
fact
there
wasn't,
but...
and
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals,
nor
the
stipulation,
includes
that
important
factor...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
which
is
why
judge
dennis
suggested
that
the
trial
court
would
have
to
make
such
a
determination
in
order
to
allow
any
court
to
apply
the
applicable
regulations.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
compelled
use.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
in
the
record
the
way
the
district...
the
trial
court
did
that,
they
didn't
get
to
the
second
point
where
they
actually
said
we're
not
alleging,
the
county
is
not...
that's
why
i
would...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
i
do,
because
the
statue
also
says...
first
of
all,
yes,
i
think
it's
reasonable.
second
of
all,
the
statute
itself
also
says
that
there's
a...
expressly
in
the
statute
there's
a
480-hour
cap
on
comp
time
banks,
and
that
after
the
employees
reach
that
cap,
they
then
can
use
the
comp
time,
and
it
has...
it
deals
with
how
to
use
it,
by
making
requests
and
so
forth,
and
therefore
it...
the
statute
doesn't
give
an
employer
a
permanent
right
to
use
compensatory
time.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right.
that's
because...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
justice
scalia,
i
would
argue
that
the
congress
didn't
quite
make
as
broad
a
concession
as
you
indicated,
because...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
first
of
all
the
statute
itself
says
that
an
employer
may
use
comp
time
only
pursuant
to
an
agreement
with
the
employees,
and
only
pursuant
to
a
number
of
other
conditions.
the
statute
also
says,
delegates
to
the
department
of
labor
to
make
regulations
about
what
that
means,
and
the
department
of
labor
has
made
regulations
that
make
precisely
clear
what
those
are.
in
addition,
while
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
was
trying
to
respond
to
garcia
and
allow
employers
to
operate
more
efficiently,
the
legislative
history
is
also
clear
that
the
comp
time
provisions
were
meant
to
accommodate
preexisting
arrangements
between
employers
and
employees,
and
that
they
weren't
the
major
part
of
the
cost
saving.
they
gave
greater
flexibility
to
the
employer,
but
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
repeatedly
is
also
clear
they
gave
a
right
to
the
employees
to
use
it
to
control
the
comp
time
in
the
legislation.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
our
position,
and
what
we
asked
for
in
both
of
our
briefs,
is
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
further
hearing
in
terms
of
the
department
of
labor
regulations,
which
required
the
investigation
of
the
extent
and
meaning
of
the
agreement
and
how
the
agreement
fit
into
the
rules.
that's
basically
correct,
your
honor,
and
the...
i
would...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
your
honor.
basically,
that
the...
covers
compels
use
exactly?
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
your
honor.
the
regulation
that
deals
with
it
is
553.23,
and
the...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
the
appendix,
the
original
appendix
to
the
petition,
which
contained
most
of
the
appendix,
at
page
46...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it's
the
white...
the
white
large...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it's
46a.
there's
a
couple
of
things,
but
the
first
is
46a,
and
that
is...
553.23(a)(1)
describes
how
you
get
an
agreement,
and
then
(2)
says
the...
it
deals
with
the
agreements,
and
this
is
a
discussion
of
the
kind
of
things
that
would
be
in
an
agreement,
and...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
you
don't.
i
mean,
i
was...
as
i
say,
i
have
to
go
to
a
couple
of
places.
what
it
says
there
is
that
the
agreements
for
comp
time
may
include
provisions
governing
preservation,
use,
and
cashing
out
of
comp
time.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
and
then
in
addition
to
that
it
says
in...
back
on
page
45,
it
says
agreements
of
understanding
may
provide
comp
time
off.
in
addition
to
the
agreement
an
understanding
may
be
a
combination...
it
goes
through
the
various
things
that
would
be
in
a
comp
time
agreement.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
as
the
letter
that
i
cited
from
the
county,
in
the
regulations
themselves
there's
no
express
treatment
of
the
compelled
use
question.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
department
of
labor's
interpretation
of
their
own
regulations,
which
is
expressed...
well,
first
of
all,
there's
three
of
them.
first
of
all,
it's
expressed
specifically
in
the
letter...
the
specific
letter,
which
in
this
case
was
actually
a
letter
to
harris
county
saying
compelled
use,
they
interpret
this
regulation
to
prevent
compelled
use,
and
that
relies
on
their
interpretation
of
this
regulation,
plus
i
think
it's
important...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it
came
from
harris
county's...
specifically
asking
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
went
to
the
labor
department.
it
was
by
the
administrator
of
the
wage
&
hour
division.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right,
and
that
was
september,
i
think
14,
1992.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
of
the
letters...
the
letter
itself
is
not
reprinted
in
the
record,
but
it's
cited
in
all
the
briefs
in
this...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
well,
i
wanted
to...
no.
and
then
in
support
of
that,
the
question
is,
how
did
the
department
of
labor
get
from
the
regulations
to
the
thing,
and
there's
two
things
in
support
of
it.
first
of
all,
the
legislative
history
itself,
of
the...
the
congressional
legislative,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
report,
refer
to
the
right
of
employees
to
use
comp
time
10
times
and
they
refer
to,
14
times,
that
it's
a
benefit
of
the
employees,
and
that
the
employees
can
cash
out
comp
time.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
there's
an
earlier
case
before
the
state.
in
texas
and
harris
county,
collective
bargaining
is
illegal.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
under
the
statute
and
regulations
they
can
do
that,
and
then
the
employees
have
the
option
of
then
either
accepting
it
and
continuing
to
work...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
or...
and
by
the
way,
under
the
regulations
they
not
only
could...
the
regulations
both
provide
a
condition
of
employment
with
those
conditions.
they
also
provide,
in
553.23(c)(1)
at
the
bottom
that
you
could
just
give
notice,
which...
there
may
be...
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
debate,
but
there
may
be
a
condition
between
making
a
condition
of
employment
and
giving
notice,
but
it
also
says
if
they
give
notice
that
we
will
have
compelled
rules,
and
if
the
employee
then
works
a
day
after
that,
it
can
be
presumed
that
he
accepted
it,
but
then
if...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
because
it
also
says
that
if
the
employee...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
the
regulation
also
says
if
the
employees
fail
to
express
an
unwillingness
to
accept
it,
it
will
be
presumed,
but
in
this
case
the
employees
did
express
an
unwillingness
to
accept
it,
and
therefore
the
opposite
presumption
i
think
would
occur,
and
again
you
have
to
read
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
section
i
cited,
so
that
in
this
case,
first
of
all...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
i
think
the
rule
is
if
an
adequate
notice
is
given
and
the
employee
says
nothing
and
works,
the
presumption
is
that
he
accepted
it,
but
if
he
expresses
an
unwillingness
to
accept
it,
then
the
presumption
is
that
he
did
not
accept
it.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
then
if
the
employer
lets
him
continue
to
work,
he
doesn't...
can't
compel
him
to
use
comp
time,
but
he
would
have
the
option
to
terminate.
i
mean,
if
they
think
it's
that
serious
a
thing
to
do,
why,
that
would
happen.
in
this
specific
case
all
those
cases,
facts
haven't
been
developed,
but
i
think
that's
the
way
it
would
go.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
i
think
they
could,
1)
say
we're
not
going
to
let
you
work
any
more
overtime.
whether
they
could
reduce
their
hours
to
a
low,
or
below
the
statute...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
first
of
all...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
regulations
say
that
the
employee's
decision
to
accept
comp
time
has
to
be
made
free
of
coercion
or
pressure,
and
that's
clear
in
the
regulations
and
the
legislative
history.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
because...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
the
regulations
say
you
can
make
it
a
condition
of
employment,
so
if
you
make
it
a
condition
of
employment,
the
person
is
free
whether
to
accept
the
job
or
not,
but
if
they
do
accept
the
job,
then
it
is
the
system
covered
by
the
regulations,
and
part
of
this
is
to
make
sense
out
of
all
the
regulations
and
the
legislative
history.
if
the
legislative
history,
which
is
trying
to...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
no.
i
think
you
can
reduce
his
hours
unless
you've
expressed
to
him
the
intent
of
your
reducing
his
hours
is
in
order
to
pressure
him
into
accepting
comp
time.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
but
other
than
that...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
i
don't
think
it
is...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
that
context.
if
the
employee
could
demonstrate
actual
coercion
they
may
have
an
argument
in
the
case,
but
absent
that...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
also
i
think
that,
along
the
same
lines
because
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
the
odd
thing
about
this
case
is
the
burden
between
the
employer
imposing
this
without
an
agreement
with
the
employees,
and
what
he
would
have
to
do
to
get
an
agreement,
is
not
a
long
road.
the
facts
in
this
case
are,
they
imposed
compelled
use
without
either
the
notice,
the
condition
of
employment,
or...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right.
in
addition
to
that,
though,
one
thing
in
your
hypothetical,
that
you
assumed
that
the
county
would
save
money
by
paying
people
in
comp
time
rather
than
cash,
and
i
don't
think
congress
assumed
that.
there's
a
slight
additional
flexibility.
in
fact...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
comp
time
in
fact
would
cost
more
than...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
so
they
may
want
to
avoid
it
by
paying
it
out
later,
but
they...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
explain,
but
they
do,
but
hypothetically
there's
a
slight
way
they
can...
it
can
cost
the
employer
more,
because
if
the
employee
is
making
$10
an
hour
in
1992,
works
for
comp
time
and
then
banks
it
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
and
then
cashes
it
in
5
years
later,
probably
he'll
be
making
$12,
so
that
could
cost...
over
the
long
haul
that
could
cost
the
employer
a
little
bit
more
money.
now,
the...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
fact,
you
have
a
defense
against
that,
because
the
employer
is
free
at
any
time
to
cash
out
the
contract,
so
they
could
avoid
that,
not
only
by
cashing
out
the
comp
time,
but
i
suggested
in
my
brief
three
or
four
other
ways
that
an
employer
can
protect
themselves
from
that
happening,
but
in
theory
that's
the
additional
cost
of
comp
time
if
it's
stored,
and
so...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
if
he
waits
till
he
retires,
there's
another
rule.
he
either
gets
the
regular
rate
or
the
higher...
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes,
and
inflation's...
but
i'm
just
saying,
other
than
that,
and
congress
is
clear
about
this
both
in
the
regulations
and
the
legislative
history,
congress'
view
was
that
you're
not
supposed
to
use
comp
time...
they
meant
comp
time
to
be
an
equivalent
of
being
paid
in
cash,
because
eventually
you
have
to
pay
the
money,
and
in
fact
in
the
real
world
it
works
out
there
would
be
areas
i've
described,
and
as
we've
described
in
our
brief,
there
are
methods
by
which
the
employer
can
save
it.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
thank
you.
