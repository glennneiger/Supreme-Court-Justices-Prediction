david
h.

all
it
has
to
be
is...
justice
david
h.
souter
covering
this...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then...
justice
david
h.
souter
i
presume
they
would
also
have
the
option
to
say,
we're
not
going
to
fire
you,
but
if
you
won't
use
the
comp
time,
we're
simply
going
to
reduce
your
weekly
hours
to
35
a
week.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
saying,
look,
we're
doing
it
because
we've
got
this
great
overhanging
liability
out
there,
and
the
only
way
we're
going
to
be
able
to
fund
it
is
to
save
money
in
some
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
wage
and
hour
law
doesn't
tell
us
how
many
hours
we
have
to
let
you
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
not
pressuring
him.
he
can
keep
his
saved
up
time
in
the
bank.
i'm
not
telling
him
he's
got
to
draw
that
down.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he'll
get...
if
he
keeps
it
till
the
end
he'll
get
paid
time
and
a
half.
i'm
simply
saying,
i've
got
to
provide
for
my
liability,
and
therefore
i've
got
to
employ
people
less
hours
in
order
to
put
the
money
aside
for
a
rainy
day.
is
that
coercion?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
example
that
i
just
gave
you
would
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
be
coercion,
you
concede?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
fact,
the
road
isn't
any
longer
than
my
hypothetical,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
know
it's
going
to
happen.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
assuming
some
fat
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
that
was
the
answer
to
my
hypothetical.
i
said,
what
if
they...
if
they
do
nothing
but
say,
we've
got
to
make
up
some
money
somehow
to
pay
for
this
overhanging
liability,
so
we're
only
going
to
employ
you
35
hours
a
week,
and
i
understood
your
friend
on
the
other
side
to
say
that
would
not
be
coercive,
and
that
would
be
okay.
in
practical
terms,
that
would
get
you
exactly
where
you
want
to
go.
justice
david
h.
souter
because...
excepting
in
one
case.
if
the
employee
says,
all
right,
by
godfrey,
i'll
work
35
hours
a
week,
but
nothing
is
going
to
induce
me
to
touch
my
accrued
comp
time.
that
nest
egg
is
going
to
stay
there
until
the
day
i
retire.
the
employee
could
do
that.
in
the
real
world,
i
presume
that
would
not
happen.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
what
this
case
boils
down
to
is
this.
if
you
reduce
hours
on
a
regular
basis,
and
you
also
choose
to
cash
out
a
portion
of
the
accumulated
time
every
week,
no
problem,
no
argument,
but
if
you
do
it
on
an
irregular
basis,
if
you
make
a
judgment
that
the
fire
department,
sheriff's
department
says,
gee
whiz,
next
week
we
haven't
got
much
process
to
serve,
so
i
think
we'll
make
so-and-so
take
wednesday
afternoon
off,
not
a
regularly
scheduled
thing
every
week,
an
irregular
judgment
from
time
to
time,
that's
what
we're
fighting
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
you
think
we're
fighting
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it's
proper
for
you
to
do
what
we
have
been
assuming
in
these
hypotheticals
you
could
do,
why
does
the
statute
place
a
cap
on
the
amount
of
comp
time
that
can
be
accumulated?
there's
absolutely
no
need
to
do
that.
you
and
other
employees
can...
employers
can
protect
yourselves.
the
cap
implies
to
me
that
you
don't
have
the
autonomy
that
we
have
been
assuming
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they're
protective
devices
so
that
we
do
not
build...
the
employee
does
not
build
up
so
much
comp
time
that
the
employer
in
effect
is
not,
at
the
end
of
the
road,
going
to
be
able
to
pay
it.
it's
for
the
protection
of
the
employee,
you're
saying.
