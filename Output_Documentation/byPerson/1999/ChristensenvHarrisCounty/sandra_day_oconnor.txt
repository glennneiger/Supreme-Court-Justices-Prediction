justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
i
ask
you
what
department
regulation
covers
this
exactly,
and
where
we
might
find
it
in
the
material
with
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
i
find
that...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
a
minute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
does...
where
do
i
find
language
here,
on
page
46a,
that
tells
me
the
employee
does
not
have
to
use
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
there
can
be
an
agreement
covering
it.
where
do
i
find
in
the
regulation
a
directive
about
what
happens
absent
an
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
to
what
do
we
defer,
then,
in
terms
of
the
labor
department?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
where
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that's
all
we
have,
really.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
these
are
all
statutory
provisions.
let
me
ask
you
this.
there's
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
here...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
we
worry
about
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
employer
say,
well,
maybe
it
wasn't
clear
in
the
past,
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
from
this
date
forward,
if
you
want
to
continue
to
work
here,
you're
going
to
have
to
use
your
comp
time,
so
if
you
want
to
stay
a
county
employee,
that's
the
rule?
can
they
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
leaving.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
has
the
county
give
notice
here...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
where
do
we
find
some
departmental
regulation
that
spells
out
what
happens...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
right.
justice
o'connor
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1167,
christensen
versus
harris
county
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
