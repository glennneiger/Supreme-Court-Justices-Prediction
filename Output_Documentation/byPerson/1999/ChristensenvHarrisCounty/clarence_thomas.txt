justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
commonly
known
as
flsa,
states
and
,municipalities
may
compensate
their
employees
for
overtime
work
by
granting
them
compensatory
time,
which
then
entitles
employees
to
time
off
with
full
pay.
petitioners
of
deputy
sheriffs
of
harris
county,
they
agreed
to
accept
compensatory
time
instead
of
cash
compensation.
as
petitioners
began
accumulating
hours
of
compensatory
time,
harris
county
became
concerned
that
the
employees
would
not
use
their
compensatory
time
by
taking
time
off.
under
the
flsa,
if
employees
do
not
use
compensatory
time,
the
county
would
have
to
pay
the
employees
in
cash
for
unused
hours.
to
avoid
a
budgetary
crisis,
the
county
ordered
petitioners
to
use
their
accumulated
compensatory
time.
petitioner
sued,
claiming
that
the
flsa
prohibits
the
county
from
compelling
employees
to
use
this
time.
the
district
court
agreed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
finding
that
nothing
in
the
flsa
prohibits
this
compelled
use.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
both
petitioners
and
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
concede
that
nothing
in
the
flsa
explicitly
prohibits
harris
county
from
requiring
employees
to
use
compensatory
time.
instead
they
argue
that
the
flsa
implicitly
prohibits
such
a
practice
in
the
absence
of
employee
consent.
they
contend
that
because
the
flsa
details
some
ways
in
which
compensatory
time
can
be
used
in
the
other
ways
including
compelled
use
are
implicitly
foreclosed,
we
disagree.
the
flsa
provision
cited
by
petitioners
and
the
united
states
simply
ensure
that
employees
receive
some
timely
benefit
for
working
overtime.
these
provisions
do
not
imply
that
an
employer
is
prohibited
from
taking
steps
to
make
sure
that
employees
actually
use
the
compensatory
time
that
they
agreed
to
accept.
citing
our
decision
in
chevron
v.
natural
resources
defense
council,
petitioners
and
the
united
states
also
argue
that
we
should
defer
to
their
reading
because
it
is
shared
by
the
department
of
labor.
prior
to
this
lawsuit,
the
department
of
labor
issued
an
opinion
letter
that
interpreted
the
flsa
to
prohibit
compelled
use.
we
decline
to
give
this
opinion
chevron
style
deference.
interpretations
such
as
those
in
opinion
letters
like
interpretations
contained
in
policy
statements,
agency
manuals,
and
enforcement
guidelines
lack
the
force
of
law
and
simply
do
not
warrant
chevron
deference.
