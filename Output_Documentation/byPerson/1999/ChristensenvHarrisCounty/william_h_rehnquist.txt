argument
next
in

edward
christensen
v.
harris
county.
spectators
are
admonished
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
leibig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
far
as
an
employee
accepting...
if
you
come
to
me
looking
for
work
and
i
say,
you
know,
you
work
40
hours
a
week,
and
you'll
be
paid
at
$10
an
hour,
and
you
go
to
work,
you've
accepted
my
deal,
have
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
say...
it's
not
a
question
of
voluntary
confession
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
suggesting
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
a
written
acceptance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
any
event,
you...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leibig...
within
reason.
mr.
leibig,
let
me
get
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
straight.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
your
client.
it
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
county
and
judge
dennis
said,
really
neither
side
should
get
summary
judgment,
and
your
position
here
is
that
judge
dennis
was
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
leibig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
on
earth
doesn't
the
secretary
say
that
in
a
regulation,
rather
than
having
to
construe
something
that's
ambiguous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
fleming,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
response?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
give
me
a
specific
example
of
what
cashing
out
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
comp
time
for
regular...
for
not
overtime,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
get
the
same
paycheck
that
they
would
if
they
had
worked
the
regular
hours?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
the
extent
you're
talking
now
beyond
the
stipulation
the
record
simply
isn't
developed,
i
suppose.
do
you
feel
you
can
speak
for
every
division
of
the
county
government
on
this,
that
this
is
exactly
how
they
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
sheriff's
department
is
the
only
defendant
in
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
that's
being
challenged
are
the
practices
in
the
sheriff's
department?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
mr.
fleming,
your
opponent
says
he
agrees
with
judge
dennis'
view
that
neither
side
was
entitled
to
summary
judgment,
and
that
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
development
of
a
factual
record.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
your
side
was
entitled
to
summary...
that
the
county
was
entitled
to
summary
judgment,
as
the
fifth
circuit
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
use
all
your
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fleming.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
