well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
capital
sentencing
schemes
in
a
state
like
arizona,
for
example,
where
a
person
can
be
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
then
the
judge
does
the
sentencing
and
is
allowed
to
increase
the
sentence
to
a
death
penalty,
set
it
at
death,
if
it
was
done
for,
let's
say,
pecuniary
gain,
some
factor
that
the
judge
determines,
and
this
court
has
upheld
that
kind
of
a
scheme.
now,
under
your
theory
that,
too,
would
be
invalid
if
we
were
to
accept
what
you've
just
been
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
jury
is
told
and
instructed,
don't
consider
the
sentence.
that's
not
your
job.
it's
up
to
the
judge.
don't
consider
that.
you
just
determine
whether
this
person
convicted...
should
be
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
i
mean,
that's
a
fact
question,
possession
of
a
firearm
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
you
are.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
total
fact-based
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's
no
logical
distinction.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
that
distinction
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
that
gets
you
right
back
to
justice
breyer's
drafting
question.
if
the
legislature
were
to
start
with
the
higher
sentence
and
then
say,
but
if
no
gun
is
used,
3
years,
otherwise,
5,
that
ought
to
be
all
right.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
you're
articulating
the
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
constitutional
line,
in
your
view,
about
what
can
be
an
element,
and
what
can
be
a
sentencing
factor?
what's
the
line?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
gochman,
now,
in
my
day
as
a
sentencing
judge
it
was
not
uncommon
to
have
statutes
making
a
crime,
let's
say
of
robbery,
punishable
for
anything
from
1
year
to
life.
let
the
judge
decide.
and
within
that
range,
it
was
not
uncommon
for
judges
to
consider
such
things
as
the
motive
of
the
crime,
or
the
lack
of
remorse,
if
that
was
the
case,
by
the
defendant,
or,
if
you
had
a
defendant
that
just
appeared
to
be
absolutely
without
remorse,
and
intending
to
create
as
much
trouble
as
he
could
for
black
citizens,
the
judge
could
take
that
into
consideration
and
impose
the
life
sentence
rather
than
the
1
year.
now,
that
was
traditional,
wasn't
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
a
long
time
around
the
country.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
we
see
today
is
a
series
of
sentencing
schemes
that
have
imposed
greater
restrictions
on
the
sentencing
judge,
given
them
narrower
options,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
within
that,
the
legislative
branch
has
tried
to
say,
well,
if
there
really
is
lack
of
remorse
or
a
bad
purpose
here,
you
can
increase
the
sentence.
is
that
what's
happening?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
a
problem
for
a
legislature
to
say
robbery
is
punishable
by
anything
from
a
year
to
life?
