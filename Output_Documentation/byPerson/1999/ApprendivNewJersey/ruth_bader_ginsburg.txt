justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'neill,
i
assume
you're
saying
that
as
long
as
it's
within
the
upper
range
that
is
specified
by
the
legislature,
but
if
you
will,
instead
of
engaging
in
things
that
you
may
be
less
familiar
with,
let's
look
at
the
very
statute
that
you're
dealing
with,
and
there
are
seven
factors
that
would
lead
to
this
doubling
of
the
penalty,
and
the
racial/gender
animus
is
just
one
of
them.
in
that
list
of
seven,
which
ones
are
not
encompassed
within
your
constitutional
objection?
which
one...
even
if
you
won
this
case,
which
one,
if
any,
could
remain
as
the
new
jersey
legislature
set
it
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
not
this
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
but
what
about
another
one
that
operates
in
the
same
way,
is
used
or
was
in
possession
of
a
stolen
motor
vehicle?
that
would
be
found
by
the
judge
on
a
preponderance,
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
yield
for
the
defendant
the
same
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
under
the
statute.
the
statute
sets
it
up
the
jury
finds
assault
or
whatever
is
the
underlying
crime,
and
then
the
judge,
under
subsection
(f),
the
one
immediately
following
subsection
(e),
your
subsection,
the
judge
is
instructed
that
if
this
crime,
this
assault
was
committed
and
the
defendant
was
at
the
time
in
possession
of
a
stolen
motor
vehicle,
then
we
get
kicked
up
from
5
to
10,
to
10
to
20.
so
i'm
asking
you
to
concentrate
on
the
very
next
section
of
the
same
statute
and
tell
me,
you
said...
you
said
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
two,
and
i
don't
understand
why
the
one
would
have
to
go
to
the
jury
and
the
other
would
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
that
the
question
of
fact
is
whether
the
defendant
used
or
was
in
possession
of
a
stolen
motor
vehicle?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
may
i
stop
you
there,
mr.
o'neill,
because
you
seem
to
be
conceding
that
this
is
a
sentencing
factor,
and
then
not
traditional,
but
i'm
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
motive.
it
says,
with
a
purpose
to
intimidate,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
are
many
criminal
statutes,
burglary
statutes,
for
example,
that
use
those
words,
with
a
purpose
to,
and
the
jury
has
to
find
that
purpose.
so
why
are
you
conceding
that
this
is
ordinarily
for
the
judge
and
with
a
purpose...
in
answer
to
justice
breyer,
who
said
there
are
no
statutes
that
make
this...
that
this
is
extraordinary,
but
with
a
purpose
to,
it
seems
to
me
is
in
a
number
of
statutes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
for
the
purpose
of
pecuniary
gain?
that's
another
one
on
this
laundry
list
that
kicks
you
up
into
the
next
sentencing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that...
wouldn't
at
least
that
one
have
to
be
decided
the
same
way
as
this
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
told
me
that
all
the
other
ones
would
stand
except
this
one,
on
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
take
it
now,
on
rethinking,
you
have
concluded
that
some
on
this
list
would
have
to
go
the
same
way,
and
that
maybe
for
pecuniary
gain
is
one
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
all
you're
doing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it,
mr.
o'neill,
that
you
would,
on
your
reasoning,
also
find
new
jersey's
harassment
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
does
the
same
thing.
it
says
a
person
who
commits
this
crime,
if
he
acted
with
a
purpose
to
intimidate
because
of
race,
color,
religion,
et
cetera.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
that.
the
section
that
i'm
looking
at
is
set
up...
uses
the
same
words
as
the
section
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
the
racial
harassment
statute
for
which
this
person
was
indicted,
but
he
didn't
plead
to
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
another
statute
in
new
jersey...
i'll
give
this
to
justice
scalia.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it...
i
assume
it
would
go
the
same
way
because
the
words
are
the
same,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
ms.
gochman,
a
defendant
says,
i
don't
understand
this
because
my
buddy
committed
a
crime.
it
was
called
burglary,
and
that
statute
said,
with
a
purpose
to,
and
he
went
to
a
jury,
and
they
had
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
i'm
being
charged
with
a
statute
that
also
says,
with
a
purpose
to,
and
the
jury
falls
away,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
falls
away.
explain
to
me
why
the
legislature,
using
the
very
same
words,
with
a
purpose
to,
in
the
one
case
can
say,
oh,
this
is
just
for
the
judge
and
the
other
must,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
give
it
to
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
motive
when
it
appears
in
the
burglary
statute?
