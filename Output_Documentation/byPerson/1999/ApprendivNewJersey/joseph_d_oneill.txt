mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
erosion
of
the
jury
by
the
new
jersey
legislature.
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
violates
the
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendments
by
permitting
the
judge
to
consider
or
assess
a
defendant's
mental
state
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
sentence
that
person
to
a
term
of
up
to
double
the
time
permitted
upon
conviction
of
the
predicate
crime.
here,
petitioner
pled
guilty
to
three
crimes,
but
was
sentenced
on
four.
in
jones
v.
the
united
states,
this
court
constructed
a
proposed
test
for
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
to
determine
whether
the
statue
creates
a
separate
element
of
a
crime
or
a
sentencing
factor.
any
fact,
other
than
prior
conviction,
which
increases
the
maximum
sentence,
implicates
constitutional
protections
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
notice
by--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--i
suggest
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
my
understanding
of
the
statutes
extant
is
that
they...
some
of
them
provide
for
the
death
penalty,
but
that's
the
maximum,
so
in
states
such
as
those...
i'm
not
intimately
familiar
with
arizona,
but
it
is
the
states
with
which
i
am
familiar,
those
penalties
would
be
within
the
maximum
and
call
for
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
a
jury
before
the
judge
sentences.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
again,
it's
within
the
maximum
provided
by
the
statute
that
the
jury
knew
about,
presumably,
before
they
found
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes,
justice
o'connor.
however,
it's
my
understanding
that
a
statute
does
provide
for
not
only
life,
of
course,
but
also,
as
you
point
out,
death,
but
within
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
justice
scalia--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--it
is,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
justice
breyer,
yes,
that
would
constitutional
so
long
as--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--the
sentence...
the
drafting
goes
something
like
this,
in
crude
language,
that
the
maximum
penalty
for
commission
of
such-and-such
crime
is
5
years.
however,
if
he
then
is
convicted
only
of
such-and-such,
it
is
a
maximum
of
3
years.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
winship
spoke
in
terms
of
formalism
but
prescribed
against
that,
so--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--no,
i
would
not
concede
that,
justice
scalia.
i
would
concede
only--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--well
then,
i
would--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--i
would
say
only,
justice
scalia
and
justice
breyer,
that
there
would
have
to
be
the
constitutional
protections
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
a
jury.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
you
can't,
under
those--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
because
the
constitutional
safeguards
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
to
a
jury,
are
paramount.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
that
question,
i
would
say
this.
if
i
can
use
the
analogy
in
the
federal
statutes
in
reference
to
drug...
drugs
as
to
quantity
and
quality.
now,
i
have
a
fallback
position,
and
that
is
this,
that
if
the
test
were
something
like
this,
if
the
maximum
sentence
is
increased
and
there
is
required
an
assessment
of
the
mental
state
of
the
defendant,
then
i
think
the
quality
and
quantity
problems
with
the
drug
statute
would
not
be
affected.
i
respectfully
suggest,
justice
breyer,
that
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
would
not
be
impacted
by
the
proposed
standard,
proposed
by
this
court
in
jones.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
say
that
the
way
it's
set
up,
all
of
them
would
remain.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
not
this
one.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
if
we're
saying
in
terms
of
the
question,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
scalia,
that
if
we're
talking
about
race,
color,
gender,
handicap,
religion,
sexual
orientation,
or
ethnicity,
then
i
think
all
of
them
require
the
same
constitutional
guidelines.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
if
there's
a
presumption
that
the
underlying
crime
was
found
to
be
violated
by
the
defendant
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
a
jury,
yes,
because
it
would
be
within
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
perhaps
i
didn't
state
my
position
clearly
enough.
my
position
is
this,
justice
ginsburg,
that
whenever
there
is
a
question
of
fact
which
raises
the
maximum
sentence
the
defendant
faces,
that
requires
a
constitutional
safeguards
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
prove
to
a
jury,
as
well
as
fair
notice.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
would
say
that
it's
a
fact
that's
a
jury
question.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
that's
a
question,
chief
justice,
that's
easily
ascertainable
as
it
is
the
issue
of
prior
conviction,
almendarez-torres.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
most
respectfully,
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
issue
as
to
whether
possession
of
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
occurred
or
not
is
subject
to
some
variables
to
which
the
possession
of
a
firearm
for
an
unlawful
purpose
is
not.
also--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--well--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--justice
o'connor...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
justice
o'connor,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
mcmillan,
it
was
simple.
it
was
objective.
there
was
no
question.
there
was
a
shooting
of
a
couple
of
people
involved--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--they
did
not
raise
the
maximum
sentence--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--in
mcmillan.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
they
required
only
a
sentence
within
the
minimum.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes.
i
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
but
i--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--i
say
this,
justice
scalia,
that
all
of
these
requirements
must
be
within
the
constitutional
limits
as
set
forth
in
cases
like
patterson
v.
new
york.
there
is
a
limit
to
which
the
legislatures
can
go.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes.
there's
a
question
of
formalism,
i
think,
implied
in
justice
breyer's
question.
i
think
that
that's
been
prescribed
by
this
court
previously.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
i
do.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
if
life
is
within
the
maximum
sentence,
no,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
think
so.
i
think
the
jury--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
at
issue
does
violate
the
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendments
because,
by
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
i
suggest
it
should
be
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
permits
a
defendant
to
assess
a
mental
state
of
the
defendant
and
submit
that
person
to
a
sentence
of
up
to
double
that
required
in
the
predicate
crime.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
that
might
very
well
be
found
by
your
court
to
be
constitutional.
however,
i
really
believe
that
that's
not
enough.
a
jury
question
is
involved
here.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
because--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--it
satisfies
the
constitutional
test
of--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--i
am.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes.
as
long
as
it's
within
the
maximum,
not
outside
the
maximum.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
it
is,
justice
breyer.
however,
there
are
cases...
there
have
been
cases
arising
out
of
this
court,
like
haupt
v.
united
states,
where
motive
was
found
to
be
a
necessary
ingredient
of
a
crime
charged,
but
traditionally
i
agree
with
your...
justice
breyer
that
traditionally
motive
is
a
sentencing
factor.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
it
certainly
is,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
because
i
think
while
a
lot
cases
have
distinguished
between
motive
as
opposed
to
purpose,
intent,
mens
rea,
mental
state--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not,
most
respectfully,
conceding
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
this,
that
while
the
statute
in
new
jersey
uses
the
term,
purpose,
it
could
have
used
motive.
it
did
not.
it
used
the
term,
purpose.
to
me,
they
are...
they
should
be
considered,
whether
it's
motive,
purpose,
in
this
particular
statute
the
same,
although
traditionally
i
agree
that
we're
talking
about
modus,
motive,
we're
talking
about
mens
rea,
we're
talking
about
intent,
mental
state...
they're
all
the
same.
some
people
have
said
in
their
opinion,
some
jurists,
that
motive
is
different,
but
here
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference.
what's
important
here
is
that
there
is
a
sentence
to
a
much...
or
a...
an
exposure
to
a
much
higher
or
stiffer
sentence
if
there
is
proof
that
a
person
committed
a
crime
with
a
purpose
to
intimidate
because
of
race.
that
requires--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--yes,
against
person
or
property
i
think
the
statute
says,
justice
ginsburg.
--yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
oh,
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
i
did
say
that,
but
i
guess
i
was
confining
my
consideration
to
the
facts
and
the
law
in
this
case,
which
have
to
do
with
purpose
to
intimidate
an
individual
because
of
race.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
think
so.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
so
long
as
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
an
increase
in
the
maximum
sentence,
then
i
think
it's
okay
to
have
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
as
in
mcmillan.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
justice
breyer,
i
say
this,
that
i
don't
concede
that
it's
necessarily
worse
to
have
a
mandatory
minimum.
i
think
it's...
it
can
be,
it
cannot
be,
but
i
think
really
it's
much
worse
to
be
exposed
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
significantly
greater
than
that
which
you
faced
at
the
time
you
pleaded
to
the
indictment.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
that's
precisely
my
position.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
that's
my
bedrock
position,
justice--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--well
put.
that's
exactly
my
position,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
so
long
as
it's
within
the
maximum,
not
extended
beyond
the
maximum,
justice--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--well,
within
constitutional
limits
they
can.
that's
the
state's
rights,
to
define
crimes
and
punishments,
but
only
within
constitutional
limits.
0....
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
it
would
seem
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
words
of
the
statute,
with
purpose
to
intimidate,
are
the
very
essence
of
the
statute
in
question
here,
and
purpose
intent
has
to
be
an
ingredient
of
the
crime,
and
when
purpose
or
intent
is
an
ingredient
of
a
crime,
its
existence
is
a
question
of
fact.
that
is
a
jury
question.
a
purpose,
a
question
of
purpose
or
intent
can
never
be
ruled
as
a
question
of
law,
but
it
always
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury...
the
new
jersey
statute
here
is
unconstitutional
because
it
takes
from
the
defendant
the
constitutional
rights
to
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
a
jury
after
fair
notice,
and
it
takes
from
the
jury
the
very
essence
of
its
existence,
which
is
that
as
a
fact-finder
and,
finally,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
person
is
stigmatized
by
conviction
as
a
racist,
that
should
be
rendered
by
the
broadest
cross-section
of
the
community,
which
is
the
jury.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
interesting
to
me
to
note
that
for
that
lesser
crime
in
new
jersey,
either
sexual
harassment
involving
race
or
racial
assault,
that
the
stringent
requirements
are
much
more
severe,
because
it...
the
statute
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
a
jury
on
those
minor
crimes,
whereas
this
major
crime,
this
very
serious
crime,
it
doesn't.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
do
you
want
me
to
address
that,
justice
scalia?
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
the
jury...
the
jury,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
it
certainly
is,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
well,
my
point
here,
to
respond
to
justice
scalia's
point
last,
is
that
when
you
have
a
charge,
indictable
charge
in
new
jersey
for
racial
assault
or
racial
harassment,
the
proofs
required
are
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
a
jury,
unlike
in
the
case
at
bar
in
apprendi,
where
you'd
have
a
situation
where
you
only
have
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
to
a
sentencing
judge
that
there's
a
violation
of
purpose
with
intent
to
intimidate
because
of
race.
that's
the
difference.
they
have
a
higher
standard
of
proof
for
a
lesser
crime
in
new
jersey
than
they
have
for
the
much
stiffer
crime,
lesser
proof,
preponderance.
that's
unconstitutional,
i
respectfully
suggest.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
i
would--
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
d.
o'neill
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like,
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
to
limit
my
rebuttal
to
a
question
posed
by
justice
thomas
concerning
the
distinction
between
element
of
a
crime
and
a
sentencing
factor.
as
we
know,
the
statute
in
question
says
the
defendant,
in
committing
the
crime,
acted
with
a
purpose
to
intimidate
because
of
race.
that
seems
to
me
that
the...
if
we
want
to
address
what
the
legislature
in
new
jersey
used
by
choice,
the
word
purpose
instead
of
the
word
motive,
it
seems
that
where
purpose
or
intent
is
an
ingredient
of
the
statute,
as
it
is
here,
that's
a
question
as
to
the
existence
of
that
motive
or
intent,
and
that
has
to
be
a
jury
question,
and
i
think
that's
the
difference.
there
is
a
denial
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
of
the
defendant's
right
to
have
a
jury
decide
this
issue
of
purpose
in
intimidating
a
person
because
of
race.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would--
