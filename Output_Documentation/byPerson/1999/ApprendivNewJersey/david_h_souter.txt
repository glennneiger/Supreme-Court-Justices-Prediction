justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
right,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think,
mr.
o'neill--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
aren't
you
resting
on
the
distinction
that
is
inherent
in
mcmillan?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
because--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you...
depending
on
whether
you
are
raising
the
jury
issue
or
the
due
process
notice/reasonable
doubt
issue,
you
may
get
different
results
in
different
cases,
and
mcmillan
is
an
example,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
has,
but
hasn't
it
also
been
the
case
traditionally
that
motive...
and
let's
just
stick
to
motive
for
a
minute...
has
never
had
the
significance
that
it
has
under
the
new
jersey
statute.
the
motive,
so
far
as
i
know,
has
never
traditionally
been
the
difference
between
10
and
20
years
and
if,
therefore,
the
motive
is
not
part
of
the
definition
of
the
crime,
and
it
does
not
go
to
the
permissible
sentence,
the
law
in
effect
sort
of
shrugged
and
said,
so
what,
it's
not
that
important
to
anything
that
is
essential
in
the
constitutional
structure.
but
new
jersey
has
chosen
to
give
it
a
very
different
role,
and
therefore
i
don't
see
why
the
traditional
shrug
about
motive
has
any
relevance
today.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
just...
your
answer
just
for
a
second.
is...
am
i
correct
that
this
tradition
of
shrugging
at
the
motive
grows
out
of
a
tradition
in
which
the
motive
does
not
determine
the
maximum
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
i've
been
assuming
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
within
maximum
sentences
set
by
the
legislature,
or,
in
an
earlier
day,
under
common
law
crimes.
we
don't
have
common
law
crimes
any
more,
so
that
to
the
extent
that
we
have
a
traditional
analogy,
i
have
been
assuming
that
that
analogy
involved
cases
in
which
the
motive
did
not
affect
the
maximum
penalty,
and
i'm
right
about
that,
am
i
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
had
whatever
range
the
legislature
specified,
but
the
range
did
not
increase
depending
on
whether
there
was
a
finding
of
motive
or
not
a
finding
of
motive.
the
judge
simply
exercised
discretion
within
the
range.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
doing
a
lot
more
than
giving
guidance.
it's
increasing
the
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is...
i'm
not
getting
the
drift
of
the
argument.
what
difference
does
this
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
knows
that.
he
says,
i
might
get
20
years,
depending
on
a
certain
finding,
and
that's
why
i
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
that's
his
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
recognizes
that,
too,
but
he
says,
those
facts
do
not
increase
the
range
of
permissible
sentence
from
10
to
20
years,
and
therefore
i
accept
the
fact
that
under
the
traditional
scheme,
which
we
assume
to
be
constitutional,
the
judge
may
find
those
facts
within
the
range
if
they
are
not
defined
as
elements.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
sure
did,
and
the
court
also
emphasized
about
a
half-a-dozen
times
that
recidivism
was
in
a
unique
place
in
sentencing
jurisprudence.
almendarez-torres
did
not
purport
to
create
a
rule
for
nonrecidivism
factors.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
didn't
have
to,
but
it
didn't
have
to
emphasize
the
uniqueness
of
recidivism,
either.
whether
the
distinction
is
a
good
one
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
the
point
is
you
can't
rely
upon
almendarez-torres
for
your
position
because
the
court
wrote
very
narrowly
in
almendarez-torres.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
a
narrower
example?
instead
of
saying,
all
wrongdoing,
let's
say
all
theft.
all
theft
is
punishable
from
zero
to
life.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
basically,
in
the
real
world,
are
saying
the
legislature
is
going
to
determine
when
there
is
a
jury
right
and
when
there
isn't.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
escape
that
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
in
any
event,
even
on
that
answer,
he
may
not
impose
the
higher
sentence
unless
the
fact
is
found.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
judge
which
creates
in
justice
scalia's
question
to
your
friend
a
moment
ago
an
entitlement
which
didn't
exist
before.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
a
way
of
defining
the
problem
out
of
existence.
the
entitlement
is
an
entitlement
not
to
get
a
sentence
beyond
a
certain
point
unless
a
fact
is
found.
what
consequence
follows
for
a
judge/jury
is
another
question,
but
there's
an
entitlement
not
to
have
a
sentence
beyond
a
certain
point.
