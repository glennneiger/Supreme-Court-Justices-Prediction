justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
o'neill,
of
course,
until
our
death
penalty
cases
in
the
1960's,
had
not
the
traditional
practice
been
that
a
judge
in
a
case
where
the
sentence
was
up
to
and
including
death
had
the
discretion
to
impose
the
death
penalty
or
not,
or
the
jury
had
the
discretion
to
impose
it
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
the
traditional
rule
against
which
the
sixth
amendment
was
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
was
our
jurisprudence
that
created
the
new
factor
that
you
could
not
impose
the
death
penalty
unless
there
were
some
special
facts
which
had
to
be
found,
either
by
the
judge
or
by
the
jury,
that
would
justify
it,
so
this
is
all
a
creation
of
this
court.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
sixth
amendment
meant
when
it
was
adopted,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
that
in
that
case,
with
that
kind
of
a
statute,
you
would
concede
that
in
order
to
get
5
years,
in
order
to
impose
5
years,
you
would
not
need
a
jury
finding
that
the
gun
was
loaded?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
premise
of
the
question,
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
you
were--
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
i
don't
understand.
all
of
them...
they're
all
valid
except
this
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
would
a
jury
have
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
car
was
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
said
it
was
not
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
back
on
that
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question?
just
switching
it
from
an
affirmative
to
a
negative,
does
that
make
the
difference?
not...
if
you
find
the
fact
you
get
more,
but
if
you
don't
find
the
fact
you
get
less.
does
that
make
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
we're
not
really
arguing
about
very
much,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
that
be
okay?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
we're
illogical
or
something?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
discretionary
sentencing
factor,
though,
traditionally,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
up
to
the
judge.
if
he
wants
to
take
motive
into
account,
he
may,
and
if
he
doesn't
want
to,
he
need
not,
and
the
defendant
who
has
the
motive
is
subject
to
up
to
50
years,
and
the
defendant
who
does
not
have
the
motive
is
subject
up
to
50
years.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why...
what...
i
don't...
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
a
traditional
sentencing
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
o'neill,
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment,
not
the
philosophical
question
of
which
is
worse
than
something
else,
and
i
thought
you
were
resting
primarily
upon
the
unbroken
tradition
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
if
you
are
liable
for
an
increased
penalty,
the
fact
that
makes
you
liable
for
that
increased
penalty
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
the
philosophical
pros
and
cons
of
that
may
be,
your
argument
is,
that's
what
the
sixth
amendment
meant.
that's
what
its
tradition
has
been
throughout
its
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this?
is
this
in
the
papers
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
haven't
read
it
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
suppose
that
means
that
the
new
jersey
legislature
could
provide
for
first
degree
murder
is
murder
with
malice
aforethought,
and
could
provide
the
death
penalty
for
that
crime,
and
could
leave
it
up
to
a
judge
to
decide
whether
there
was
malice
aforethought,
and
to
decide
that
just
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
an
espionage
prosecution?
someone
has
stolen
papers,
highly
secret
papers
from
the
defense
department.
it
is
treason
punishable
by
death
if
the
reason
they
were
taken
was
to
give
them
over
to
a
foreign
power--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
hostile
to
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
if...
congress...
no,
i...
congress
chooses
not
to
make
it
an
element.
congress
just
says,
anyone
who
takes
papers
from
the
defense
department
that
are
classified
secret
is
guilty
of
an
offense,
10
years
in
prison.
however,
if
the
purpose
of
taking
them
is
to
give
them
over
to
a
foreign
power
hostile
to
the
united
states,
the
death
penalty,
and
the
latter
question
will
be
decided
by
a
judge
on
the
basis
of
whether
it's
more
likely
than
not.
you
know,
it's
a
close
question,
but
on
balance
i
think
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
he
should
get
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
shock
you,
that
outcome
at
all?
i
mean,
that
seems
to
you
in
accord
with
our
traditions
of
jury
trial
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
death
penalty
cases
are
cases
apart.
i
mean,
death
penalty
cases
are
not
in
accord
with
our
jurisprudence
on
anything
else,
and
to...
you
know,
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
death
penalty
cases
would
be
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
were
all
sorts
of
mens
rea.
you
speak
of
mens
rea
as
though
it's
one
single,
narrow
thing.
there
were
different
mens
rea
for
different
crimes,
and
all
that
is
going
on
here
is
that
the
new
jersey
legislature
has
defined
a
special
mens
rea
for
this
crime
that
gets
a
higher
penalty,
namely,
among
the
other
mental
dispositions,
there
has
to
be
the
mental
disposition
of
committing
this
crime
because
of
hostility
on
the
basis
of
race,
or
whatever
the
other
factors
are.
that's
mens
rea.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
new
jersey
has
added
an
additional
mens
rea
element
and
it
says,
if
there's
this
additional
one,
this
additional
mental
disposition,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
higher
penalty,
but
this
second
one,
we're
not
going
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
we're
going
to
let
the
judge
find
it
by
a
preponderance.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
still
mens
rea.
i
don't
see
how
you
can,
you
know,
single
out
some
things
that
you
can
play
with
this
way
and
other
ones
that
you
can't
on
the
basis
of
some
distinction
between
mens
rea
and
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
makes
it
an
element
of
defense,
its
mens
rea.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
still
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
call
it
actus
reus?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
neither
actus
reus,
nor
mens
rea,
it's
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--some
third
thing
that
we
never
heard
of
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
traditionally.
death
penalty
schemes
are
a
creation
of
the
last
20
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
consider
that
much
of
a
tradition.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me
ask
this
about
the
traditional
old
days.
suppose...
did
the
defendant
in
the
traditional
old
days
have
an
entitlement
not
to
get
more
than
1
year
if
he
was
shown
to
be
really
remorseful?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
you
were
very
familiar
with
the
traditional
scheme
when
justice
o'connor
described
it,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
of
a
sudden
it's
not
clear.
it's
a
traditional
statute
for
this
crime,
1
year
to
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
the
defendant
showed
enormous
remorse,
would
he
be
entitled...
entitled...
to
get
only
1
year,
or
only
20,
or
only
30?
he
had
no
entitlement
whatever,
did
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
did
the
crime,
he
knew
he
got
life,
and
if
he
got
any
less
than
life
it
was
a
matter
of
grace
and
good
luck,
and
if
he
got
a
hanging
judge,
too
bad.
you
did
the
crime.
that's
the
risk
you
took.
wasn't
that
the
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
there
are
no
risks
here.
here
there
is
an
entitlement
to
get
a
lesser
sentence.
isn't
there
an
absolute
entitlement
unless
you
are
found
to
have
this
state
of
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
he's
not
entitled
even
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
answering
the
wrong
question,
chief
justice.
assuming
that
the
judge
does
not
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
this
mental
state
existed,
is
he
not
entitled
to
get
the
lower
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
and
there
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
no
such
entitlement
under
the
traditional
1
year
to
life
system.
there
was
nothing
you
were
entitled
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
when
you
give
entitlements,
what
go
along
with
the
entitlements
are
certain
requirements,
including
the
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
criterion
for
the
drawing
of
the
line?
now,
do
you
agree
with
the
state
of
new
jersey?
as
i
understand
the
state's
position,
it's
that
anything
can
be
made
a
sentencing
factor
which
was
not
a
traditional
element,
that
if
it's
a
traditional
element,
it
has
to
remain
an
element.
if
it's
a
traditional
sentencing
factor,
it
can
be
made
a
sentencing
factor.
is...
do
you
agree
with
that
line?
that's
how
i
understand
the
state's
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that's
the
way
it's
always
been?
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
that.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
in
those
cases
i
assume
the
judge
must
impose
20
years
if
a
certain
factor
is
found,
and
must
impose
40
years
if
a
certain
factor
is
found.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
be
written--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you
have
a
reasonable
legislature.
the
problem
is,
you
don't
give
me
any
basis
for
stopping
a
legislature
that
wants
to
make
theft
a
crime
and
leave,
you
know,
anything
from
zero
to
100
years
hang
upon
whether
some
judge
finds
more
likely
than
not
that
the
type
of
theft
was
one
thing
or
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
the
constitution
should
not
presume
a
beneficent,
well-meaning
legislature.
you
have
to
give
me
some
way
to
protect
citizens
from
a
legislature
that
does
not
like
juries.
justice
antonin
scalia
from
an
executive
that
does
not
like
juries.
