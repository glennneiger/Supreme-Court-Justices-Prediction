ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
new
jersey
legislature
has
made
clear,
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
confirmed,
that
the
extended
term
provision
of
the
hate
crime
statute
which
addresses
motive
is
a
sentencing
factor,
and
not
an
element
of
the
predicate
offense.
motive,
as
this
court
has
recognized
over
100
years
ago,
may
be
probative
of
guilt,
but
it
is
not
essential
to
a
conviction
unless
the
legislature
chooses
to
include
it
as
an
element
of
a
particular
offense.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
respectfully,
malice
aforethought
is
not
the
same
as
motive.
malice
aforethought
is
that
yes,
you
intended
to
commit
this
crime,
but
even
with
malice
aforethought,
the
prosecution
does
not
need
to
prove
the
defendant's
motive,
why
did
he
want
to
commit
the
crime.
he
may
have
wanted
to
kill
somebody
because
he
owed
him
money,
because
he
made
some
sort
of
unwarranted
advances.
but
malice
aforethought
has
always
been
deemed
intention,
and
part
of
mens
rea,
and
it's
different
from
motive.
motive
goes
to
the
underlying
reason.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
defense,
by
its
plea
of
guilty,
satisfied
the
elements
of
new
jersey's
possession
of
a
weapon
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
that's
correct,
so
malice--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--if
congress--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--if
congress
chose
to
make
that
motive
an
element
of
that
particular
crime,
then
yes,
that
would
have
to
go
to
the
jury.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
under
this
court's
capital--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--under
this
court's
capital
jurisprudence,
that
would
be
permissible--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--so
long
as
the
jury
finds
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
elements
of
the
predicate
offense.
it
then
goes
to
the
judge
to
determine
the
aggravating
factors,
including--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--that's
in
accord
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
death
penalty
cases.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
if
a
judge
can
increase
a
defendant's
sentence
from
life
imprisonment
to
death
based
on
aggravating
factors,
and
that's
constitutional
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
then
certainly
it
would
be
constitutional
to
increase
the
petitioner's
sentence
by
a
mere
2
years
on
a
noncapital
offense.
it's
the
same...
we're
dealing
with
the
same
constitutional
amendments
and
the
same
clauses.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well,
it
would
be
the
same
thing.
the
legislature
has
authorized
a
higher
sentence
when
the
judge
makes
a--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--it
may
be
disproportionate
under
another
constitutional
framework,
but
it's
not
unconstitutional
within
this
particular
framework
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
perhaps
it's
disproportionate,
but
this
court
said--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--no.
that
would
probably
go
way
too
far.
that
would
be
too
extreme.
it's
very
vague.
it's
very
overbroad.
it
wouldn't
give
notice
to
criminal
defendants
of
exactly
what
their
conduct
was,
what
the
requisite
mens
rea
was.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well,
we're
not
suggesting
at
all
that
we
can
take
away
from
the
prosecutor's
burden
to
prove
mens
rea
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
any
of
the
traditional
elements
of
traditional
offenses.
that's
not
at
all
what
we're
arguing
here,
so
that
that
hypothetical
would,
of
course--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--well,
in
common
law,
elements
of
the
offense
had
to
be
the
mens
rea,
the
actus
reis,
and
the
causation,
and
at
least
in
new
jersey
grading
provisions
are
by
legislative
grace,
not
by
constitutional
prerogative,
so
that
you
look
to
the
common
law,
see
what
the
bedrock
elements
of
those
particular
crimes
were,
and
when
the
prosecution
starts
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant,
or
when
the
legislature
crafts
a
statute
that
includes
presumptions
of
guilt,
then,
of
course,
we're
going
too
far,
but
that's--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--the
crime
to
which
defendant
pleaded
guilty
is
possession
of
a
weapon
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
and
it
already
has
a
mens
rea
element
and
that
is,
petitioner's
purpose,
or
conscious
objective,
was
to
use
the
firearm
against
the
person
or
property
of
another,
and
he
satisfied
that
element
of
the
offense
when
he
pleaded
guilty
and
said
that
he
fired
his
rifle
into
the
house
of
the
fowlkes
family
in
order
to
scare
them.
that
was
all
that
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
in
order
to
find
this
defendant
guilty
of--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--well,
our
position--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
our
position
is,
is
that
it's
not
mens
rea.
motive
is
a
sentencing
factor
that
does
not
have
to
be
proved
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
any
prosecution
unless
the
legislature
chooses
to
make
it
an
element
of
the
offense.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
no,
it's
not
mens
rea.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
it's
an
additional
aggravating
factor
that,
by
legislative
grace,
the
legislature
has
required
the
prosecution
to
prove.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
it's
not
actus
reus,
it's--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--well,
even
to
the
extent,
if
this
court
wants--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--if
this
court
wants...
well,
your
honor,
in
pointer
v.
united
states
back
in
1894,
i
believe
it
was,
this
court
held
that
motive
is
never
an
essential
element
of
the
crime,
and
that
was
murder
in
that
particular
case.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
there
are
several
types
of
motive
that
are
used
in
capital
juris...
in
capital
sentencing
schemes,
including--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--but
under
death
penalty
schemes
it
can
be
used
to
increase
the
sentence
to
death.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--if
the
tradition
is
that
sentencing
judges
had
wide
discretion
in
a
wide
range
of
statutory...
or
not
statutory,
but
maximum
sentences,
then
certainly
motive--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--i
believe
that
you
are.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
but
at
that
point
also
judges
had
wide
ranges
and
could
impose
a
sentence
up
to
life
imprisonment
based
on
a
person's
bad
motive,
just
as
the
same
that
a
judge
could
give
a
lesser
sentence--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--right,
and
now
what
the
legislature
is
doing
is
simply
giving
greater
guidance
to
sentencing
courts
in
how
to--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--when
you
look
at
the
new
jersey
sentencing
code...
elements
of
the
offenses
and
the
substantive
crimes
are
found
in
the
first
part
of
the
new
jersey
criminal
code.
sentencing
provisions
are
in
the
latter
part,
so
that
when
a
defendant
is
charged
in
an
indictment
and
he's
given
a...
he's
told
what
particular
offense
he
has...
he's
charged
with,
he
then
has
to
go
to
the
sentencing
section
to
find
out
what
types
of
sentences
he
may
be
eligible
for.
he
may
be
eligible
for
mandatory
minimum
sentences,
mandatory
increasements,
or
extended
terms,
so
it's...
you
have
to
look--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--that
when
defendant
was
charged
with
possession
of
a
weapon
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
it
was
not
necessarily
under
the
new
jersey
code
that
all
he
was
going
to
get
at
the
end
of
this
prosecution
was
a
maximum
of
10
years.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
but
there
are
other
facts
as
well
that
a
sentencing
court
can
take
into
consideration.
for
example--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--in
this
court's
opinion
in
almendarez-torres
v.
united
states,
this
court
held
that
an
increase
in
sentence
based
on
a
traditional
sentencing
factor,
there
it
was
recidivism,
was
constitutionally
permissible.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well,
of
course,
it
did
not
have
to.
it
was
only
addressing
that
particular
statute.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
that's
correct
and,
indeed,
in
this
particular
instance
the
defendant
has
probably
been
given
more
due
process
than
was
given
under
a--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--more
discretionary
scheme.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
not
under
the
new
jersey
statute,
which
requires--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--so
long
as
the
defendant
had
the
opportunity
to
rebut
that.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well,
we've
come
very
far
from
there,
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
that
sentencing
scheme
was
fit
within
a
particular
crime,
or--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--well,
i'm
not
sure
about--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--okay.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
that--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--not
if
it's
a
sentencing
factor,
because
it's
not
a
state
of
mind.
state
of
mind
goes
to
the
underlying--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
but
he
is...
it's
not
an
entitlement.
it
is
by
statutory
prerogative
that
he
must
get
that
letter
sentence.
the
judge
must
make
a
finding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
so
yes--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--the
same
words.
entitlement
or--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--or
by
statute.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
well
then,
we've
given
defendant
more
due
process
than
an
older
system.
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
phrase,
with
a
purpose
to,
in
its
proper
context
and
that
is
motive,
and
this
court
is,
of
course,
bound
by
that
court's--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--it's
not
the
ultimate
motive,
not
at
all,
in
the
burglary
statute,
if
a
defendant
has
burglarized
a
house
with
a
purpose
to
commit
a
felony
within,
but
again
the
prosecution
doesn't
have
to
prove
why
that
person
wanted
to
commit
the
felony.
did
he
want
to
commit
a
robbery
because
he
had
a
claim
of
right
to
that
money?
did
he
want
to
commit
a
robbery
because
he
wants
to
feed
his
drug
habit?
did
he
want
to
commit
a
robbery
because
he
wanted
to
feed
his
hungry
family?
that
is
motive,
and
that
the
prosecution
does
not
have
to
prove.
yes,
we
have
to
show
that
he
entered
that
residence
or
business
with
the
purpose
to
commit
another
offense,
but
we
don't
have
to
prove
why
he
wanted
to
do
so.
that
part
is
motive,
and
that's
distinct
from
the
intent,
which
is
the
purpose
to
in
the
burglary
statute,
and
when
read
in
its
proper
context,
as
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
interpreted
it,
with
a
purpose
to
equals
by
its
motivation,
and
that
is
a
sentencing
factor,
because
we
did
not
have
to
prove
that
to
prove--
ms.
lisa
s.
gochman
--thank
you.
