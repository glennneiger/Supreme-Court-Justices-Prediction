mr.
dumont,
that's
just
the
problem.
you
agree
that
if
it's
an
element
of
the
offense
it
goes
to
the
jury.
justice
clarence
thomas
you
agree
that
if
it's
an
enhancement
it
can
go
to
the
judge.
justice
clarence
thomas
as
a
sentencing
factor.
the
difficulty
i
have
is
that
nowhere
have
we
defined
what
the
distinction
is
between
an
element
of
the
offense
and
an
enhancement
factor,
and
if
you
could
do
that
in
your
few
minutes
it
would
be
very
helpful.
