justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mcmillan,
they
didn't
raise
the
maximum
sentence,
either.
it
was
within
the
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i--
--of
course,
how
would
that
example
apply
to
a
case
like
this?
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
all
sorts
of
different
cases,
but
here
the
extra
fact
to
be
proved
was
a
specific
kind
of
intent.
how
can
you
write
a
statute
that
would
make
that
a
defense?
i
didn't
have
that
intent?
i
mean,
those
examples
just
don't
fit
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
really
try
to
decide
what
to
do
with
this
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
wouldn't
agree
if
there
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
who
has
to
make
the
finding
of
harassment
under
that
other
statute,
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
that's
totally
consistent
with
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
difference
is,
as
justice
scalia,
i
guess,
has
already
pointed
out,
that
in
the
one
case
the
legislature
has
authorized
the
death
penalty
for
the
facts
found
by
the
jury,
not
in
his
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only...
but
in
his
example,
if
the
additional
fact
is
found
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
by
a
judge,
and
that
can
make
the
difference,
in
your
view,
between
a
10-year
sentence
and
a
life
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
a
legislature
had
a
statute
that
authorized
a
crime
called
wrongdoing,
just
prove
anything
wrong,
and
then
it
had
a...
and
the
jury
has
to
find
the
wrong,
but
then
the
judge
is
directed
to
impose
a
whole
range
of
sentences,
depending
on
what
the
wrong
is,
and
he
has
to
do
it
just
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
i
suppose
that
would
be
perfectly
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
could
perhaps
have
a
checklist
of
95
different
things
that
would
qualify
as
wrongdoing.
any
one
of
those
is
found,
then
you
turn
over
the
matter
to
the
judge,
and
from
there
on
it's
up
to
the
judge
on
the
basis
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
no
jury
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
historically
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you
right
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
go
back
to
the
general
discretion
that
justice
o'connor
described,
and
you
apply
that
in
this
case,
it
would
be
permissible
for
this
additional
sentence
to
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
a
report
made
by
the
parole
officer
in
the
pre...
in
the
post...
in
the
presentence
report,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
mean,
constitutionally
it
would
be
permissible.
you'd
have
everything
the
same,
except
you
don't
need
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
all
you
need,
the
parole
officer's
recommendation,
and
the
judge
could
rely
on
that
and
increase
the
sentence
by
10
years,
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
old
way
of
sentencing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
didn't
even
need
the
opportunity
to
rebut
it
in
the
traditional,
old
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
isn't
this
an
outlier
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
this
an
outlier
case?
there's
no
precedent
for
this
particular
statute,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ups
the
sentence
by
10
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
happy
to
be
on
the
majority
in
this
case.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
it
originated
in
a
town
called
vineland,
new
jersey
where
the
defendant
one
evening,
late
in
night,
i
should
say
about
2
o’clock
in
the
morning,
after
he
consumed
a
good
deal
of
alcohol,
fired
several
bullets
at
a
house
that
was
occupied
by
an
african-american
family.
he
was
picked
up
by
the
police
about
an
hour
later
and
acknowledged
the
shooting
and
was
therefore
indicted
for
the
crime
of
unlawful
possession
of
a
weapon,
which
is
a
second
degree
offence
in
new
jersey
that
carries
a
sentence
of
from
five
to
ten
years,
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
that
offence.
but
there
is
a
separate
statute
in
new
jersey
that’s
called
a
hate
crime
law,
and
it
provides
for
an
extended
term
of
imprisonment
if
a
crime
is
committed
with
the
purpose
to
intimidate
an
individual
or
group
because
of
race,
color,
or
gender,
or
handicap,
religion,
sexual
orientation,
or
ethnicity,
and
if
the
extended
term
is
authorized
by
a
finding
of
that
crime,
the
sentence,
instead
of,
being
from
five
to
ten
years
is
from
10
to
20
years.
under
the
extended
term
statute,
the
new
jersey
legislature
has
provided
that
the
finding
should
be
made
by
a
judge
based
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rather
than
by
a
jury
based
on
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
is
customary
for
elements
of
a
crime.
back
in
1970,
in
a
case
called
in
re
winship,
we
held
that
the
due
process
clause
protects
the
accused
against
conviction
upon
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged.
now,
in
this
case,
the
judge
did
find
the
unlawful
bias
and
therefore
imposed
the
sentence
in
excess,
what
would
otherwise
be
the
maximum
of
ten
years,
he
imposed
a
12
year
sentence
for
this
crime,
and
the
question
is
whether
for
the
finding
that
authorized
that
sentence
had
to
be
made
by
a
jury
on
the
higher
standard
of
proof
or
was
it
permissible
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
upheld
the
sentence
and
regranted
certiorari
to
review
that
holding
and
today
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
conclude
that
the
fact
that
has
that
importance
in
the
sentencing
scheme
that
it
raises
the
maximum
sentence
from10
to
20
years,
is
one
that
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury
and
on
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
he
ends
with
the
sentence,
“the
guarantee
that
in
all
criminal
prosecution
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury,
has
no
intelligible
content
unless
it
means
that
all
the
facts
which
must
exist
in
order
to
subject
the
defendant
to
illegally
prescribe
punishment
must
be
found
by
the
jury.”
that’s
the
essence
of
the
holding
of
the
majority.
in
addition
to
justice
scalia’s
concurring
opinion,
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
scalia,
which
carefully
reviews
the
history
of
that
provision.
justice
o’conner
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer
joined,
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
