justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
tell
me
what
the
rule
was
at
the
common
law.
two
people
tried
with
kidnapping.
one
of
the
kidnappers
tormented
the
victims,
threatened
them,
pushed
them
around.
the
other
was
rather
passive.
they're
both
simply
tried
with
kidnapping.
at
sentencing,
the
judge
said,
now,
you,
defendant
a,
caused
much
more
torment
and
grief
and
suffering.
i'm
giving
you
life.
you,
defendant
b,
were
rather
passive.
i'm
giving
you
20
years.
anything
wrong
with
that
at
common
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
now,
suppose
the
legislature
specifies
that
if
torment
is
called...
is
caused,
it
would
be
life,
and
if
not,
20
years,
then
there's
a
constitutional
requirement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
can't
say,
as
you
did
at
the
outset,
that
congress
is
eroding
the
jury
sentencing.
it
seems
hard
to
erode
the
jury
sentencing
when
all
congress
has
done
is
provide
some...
or
the
legislature
has
done
is
to
provide
some
guidance
to
its
judgment...
judges
in
sentencing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
agreed--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
agreed
with
me
that
under
the
common
law
and
the
kidnapping
hypothetical
the
judge
would
have
the
discretion
to
sentence
the
defendant
who
caused
torment
to
the
victims
much
more
severely
than
the
other
defendant.
you
agreed
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
you're
doing
is
saying
that
the
legislature
cannot
prescribe
what
judges
will
do.
that's
what
you're
saying.
