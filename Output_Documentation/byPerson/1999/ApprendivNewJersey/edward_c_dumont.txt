mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
what
new
jersey
did
was
to
convict
petitioner
of
a
very
traditional,
conventional
crime,
possession
of
a
weapon
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
it's
a
crime
with
a
long
common
law
tradition.
it
seeks
to
punish
him
more
severely
than
it
otherwise
would
for
that
crime
for
an
equally
conventional
reason,
that
he
acted
with
a
particularly
bad
purpose.
now,
that
sentencing
policy
decision
does
not,
in
our
view,
become
unconstitutional
simply
because
the
state
specified
the
bad
motive
factor
in
a
statute
and
required
the
judge
to
find
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
before
he
was
permitted
to
go
over
a
certain
level
in
the
sentence.
now,
we
all
agree,
i
think,
that
a
legislature
normally
may
define
the
elements
of
a
crime
and
fix
the
minimum
and
maximum
punishments
for
that
crime.
what
the
legislature
does
in
these
cases
is
to
make
a
subsidiary
decision
that
a
particular
factor
is
not
sufficiently
central
to
guilt
or
innocence,
or
perhaps
it
would
be
so
cumbersome
or
unfair
to
present
at
trial
that
it
should
not
be
sent
to
the
jury
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
that
it
is
important
enough,
in
the
legislature's
view,
to
the
proper
punishment
for
the
offense
that
the
judge
should
be
constrained
in
his
sentencing
decisions
in
that
finding
this
factor
by
a
preponderance...
not
by
reasonable
doubt,
but
by
a
preponderance...
should
be
necessary
before
the
judge
may
go
over
a
certain
level
in
sentencing.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
it
is
a
tall
order.
what
the
court
has
said...
i
think
i
can
give
you
parameters.
the
court
has
said,
on
the
one
hand,
that
it
is
almost
always
the
legislature's
prerogative
to
define
the
elements
of
the
offense.
the
court
has
also
said,
made
very
clear
in
this
series
of
cases,
that
there
are
limits
past
which
the
legislature
may
not
go
consistent
with
due
process
and
the
jury
right.
an
example
we
would
be
willing
to
give,
if
a
legislature
tried
to
define
double
parking
as
a
petty
offense
subject
to
a
fine,
but
then
said,
if
the
judge
finds
that
you
were
double-parked
because
you
were
going
to
escape
from
a
bank
robbery,
then
it's
life
imprisonment,
we
think
that
would
be
so
contrary
to
our
traditions
and
so
obviously
abusive,
that
it
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
but
that
line
has
to
be
drawn
very
far
out
in
order
to
give
proper
due
to
the
legislature's
prerogative.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
tradition
and
common
practice
are
helpful
guides
in
looking
at
a
particular
statute,
but
no,
they
don't
define
a
particular
line.
i
guess
i
would
have
two
answers
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
line.
at
the
furthest
doctrinal
level,
i
think
that
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
if
the
court
becomes
convinced
beyond,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase,
a
constitutional
doubt,
that
a
legislature
is
punishing
a
defendant
for
something
other
than
the
crime
described
by
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
which
he
was
convicted,
then
there
is
reason
for
grave
concern,
and
possibly
that
statute
is
unconstitutional.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
legislature
has
wide
right
to
define
crimes
and
to
punish
them
very
severely,
so
the
question
to
be
asked,
to
take
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
for
instance,
from
his
dissent
in
monge,
of
the
statute
that
says,
any
intentional
causing
of
harm
is
a
crime,
and
everything
else
is
a
sentencing
factor,
you
have
to
start
with
the
supposition
that
the
legislature
could
not
enact
that
offense
just
as
a
crime
and
then
say,
it
is
a
crime,
and
the
sentence
is
up
to
life
imprisonment
or
death
in
appropriate
cases,
and
the
judge
decides.
now,
if
that
is
constitutionally
problematic,
which
we
think
it
probably
would
be,
it's
probably
the
same
constitutional
problem
that
we
can
see
here.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no.
no,
not
at
all.
my
point
is
only
that
at
some
extreme
there
may
be
a
due
process
or
a
jury
trial
when
the...
on
even
just
imposing
a
crime
and
imposing
a
punishment
of
up
to
life
imprisonment
or
death.
now--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--on
its
face,
the
statute
is
constitutional.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
the
way
it's
always
been
except
for
common
law
crimes,
and
common
law
crimes
were
crimes
that
were
defined
by
courts,
and
they
were
always
understood
to
be
at
the
pleasure
of
the
legislature
if
the
legislature
chose
to
make
a
different
disposition.
now--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
take
the
federal
system.
congress
is
the
only
body
that
can
define
a
crime,
so
if
you
don't
have
a
congressional
enactment,
you
don't
have
a
statute,
you
don't
know
what
the
elements
are
and,
in
fact,
there
are
no
elements.
there
is
no
crime.
so,
of
course,
whether
you
get
a
jury
trial
right
always
depends
on
what
the
legislature
has
defined
to
be
a
crime.
now,
if
i
can
just
address
for
a
moment
the
jones
rule,
because
i
think...
we
have
two
points
to
make
about
the
proposed
jones
rule.
one
is
that
it
would
cut
out
a
lot
of
legislative
conduct
that
to
us
is
perfectly
legitimate
and
even
laudable,
and
if
you
take
the
traditional
robbery,
or,
say,
a
kidnapping
statute
that
says...
the
federal
one
says
zero
to
death,
actually,
and
that's
what
the
statute
says
now.
suppose
congress
says,
well,
we'd
like
to
bring
a
little
more
order
to
the
sentencing
process,
so
we
think
it's
going
to
be
presumptively
25
years,
but
if
a
child
is
involved,
or
there
was
bodily
injury,
then
it's
going
to
be
25
to
40,
and
if
someone
was
killed,
if
the
victim
was
killed,
then
it
ought
to
be
from
40
to
life.
now,
you
can
look
at
that
statute
and
say,
this
is
terrible
for
defendants
because
now
they've
been
deprived
of
their
jury
right,
or
you
can
look
at
it
and
say,
that's
terrific
for
defendants,
because
two-thirds
of
the
defendants
now
have
a
25-year
cap
on
their
sentence,
so
we
don't
see
the
fundamental
fairness
argument
here.
the
second
point
to
be
made
about
the
jones
rule--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it
can
be
written
either
way.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
can
be
written
either
as
a
mandatory
minimum
of
20
and
then
up
to
40,
or
it
can
be
written
as,
that
the
range
increases
to
40
years
if
somebody
was
injured,
because--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
correct,
but
what
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--but
the
entitlement
is
only
to
have
the
judge
make
that
determination
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
is
true,
but
the
question
you
have
to
face
is
why
you
should
erect
a
flat
constitutional
bar
to
the
legislature
making
that
choice,
and
that
is
informed
by
this
analysis,
i
believe.
if
the
legislature
knows
it
has
only
two
choices,
zero
to
life,
or
make
these
into
elements
of
the
offense
and
require
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
may
decide
they're
not
important
enough
for
that,
and
that
is
not
very
protective
of
defendants.
if
the
legislature
has
the
option
of
saying,
well,
these
intermediate
steps
we
think
are
important
enough
to
be
serious
sentencing
factors
but
they're
not
important
enough
for
us
to
make
them
elements
of
the
offense,
we
think
constitutionally
they
ought
to
have
that
choice,
and
that
that
is
not
going
to
be
unfair
to
defendants.
in
fact,
it's
going
to
be
fairer
to
defendants.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
justice
scalia,
all
i
can
leave
you
with
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
constitution
first
of
all--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--what
we
know
is,
the
constitution
presumes
that
legislatures
act
within
the
constitutional
bounds
of
their
power,
and
there
ought
to
be
a
high
burden
on
one
who
suggests
that
they
have
not,
and
our
suggestion
is
that
the
rule
suggested
here,
although
it
has
an
attractive
superficial
clarity,
will
cut
out
a
wide
variety
of
appropriate
legislative
conduct
like
the
conduct
here,
and
there's
no
justification
for
doing
that
in
order
to
prevent
the
outlier
case.
we
agree
that
there
can
be
outlier
cases.
the
court
has
always
made
that
clear.
it
hasn't
found
one
yet.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
maybe
it
will.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
not
an
outlier
case
because
all
new
jersey
did
was
to
decide
that
something
bad,
particularly
bad
purpose
which
is
traditional--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--thank
you.
