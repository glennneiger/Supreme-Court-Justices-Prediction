we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-478,
charles
c.
apprendi,
jr.
v.
new
jersey.
mr.
o'neill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
arizona
the
jury
simply
finds
a
person
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
leaves
the
option
of
life
imprisonment,
or
death,
to
the
judge,
so
that
clearly
the
judge
is
imposing
a
sentence
that
was
perhaps
within
the
range
the
jury...
but
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
life.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania,
where
you're
talking
about
crime
done
with
possession
of
a
gun?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
wouldn't
possession
of
a
motor
vehicle,
a
stolen
motor...
be
equally
easily
found
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
to
be...
the
fact
to
be
found
by
a
judge,
rather
than
a
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--shall
we
charge
justice
scalia's
question
to
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
argue
all
by
yourself,
without
any
questions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
balance--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
o'neill.
mr....
ms.
gochman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
traditionally,
as
i
understand
the
common
law,
there
was
no
inquiry
into
motive.
it
was
just
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
motive
didn't
make
any
difference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--let
her
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
gochman.

o'neill,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'neill.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
