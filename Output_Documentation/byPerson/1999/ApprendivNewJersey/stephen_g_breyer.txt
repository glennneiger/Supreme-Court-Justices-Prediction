justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i
can
get
at
the
same
question
that
justice
o'connor
and
the
chief
justice
had
in
a
slightly
different
way.
imagine
that
i'm
in
congress
and,
as
member
of
congress,
i
tell
you
the
following.
you're
my
drafter.
i
say,
here's
what
i'd
like
to
do.
i'd
like
to
write
this
criminal
statute
for
bank
robbery
so
that
the
sentencing
works
as
follows,
so
that
where
the
gun
is
loaded,
there's
a
higher
sentence.
where
the
gun
isn't
loaded,
there's
a
lower
sentence.
that's
how
i
want
the
sentencing
to
work.
the
crime
is
bank
robbery,
but
i
want
these
judges
to
be
pretty
uniform,
and
i
want
them
all
to
give...
you
know,
they
have
a
bigger
range
where
the
gun's...
you
see,
where
the
gun
is
loaded,
and
a
lower
range
where
it's
not
loaded.
how
do
i
draft
it?
can
i
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
draft
it?
what
do
the
words
say?
let's
imagine,
you
know,
i
want
them
to
have
up
to
3
years
if
the
gun
isn't
loaded,
but
up
to
5
years
if
it
is
loaded.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
if
i
can
do
that,
then
what
will
happen
if
you
win
this
case
is
all
that
has
to
happen
is
that
congress
goes
back,
redrafts
all
the
drug
laws,
and
in
the
meantime
i
guess
we
have
new
trials
of
everybody
who's
been
convicted,
but
they
just...
it's
just
a
drafting
matter,
is
that
right,
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
write
the
same
thing,
but
instead
of
saying
the
thing
goes
from
3
to
5
years,
3-year
max
unloaded
and
5-year
max
loaded,
what
they
do
is,
they
write
5-year
max,
period,
but
no
more
than
3
if
it's
unloaded.
it's
just
drafting.
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay,
so
what
you're
saying
is,
i
can't...
if
i'm
congress,
i
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--prescribed
circumstances.
fine.
if
i
can't,
my
question
would
be,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
that
point.
now
my...
i'm
trying
to
get
you
down
a
little
line
of
questioning
here,
and
then
i'd
say
if
that's
true,
then
i
guess
exactly
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
sentencing
commission
does
the
3-5
year
business,
and
again
i'd
say
exactly
the
same
is
true
if
a
judge
does
it,
which
brings
us
back
to
justice
o'connor.
now,
how...
i
mean,
on
that
line
that
you've
just
taken,
if
i
agree
with
you,
i
guess
i'm
holding
the
sentencing
commission
unconstitutional
and,
indeed,
i
guess
i'm
holding
as
well
unconstitutional
the
situation
where
a
judge
says,
defendant,
i've
looked
at
the
presentence
report.
it
says
your
gun
was
loaded.
you
can
dispute
it,
but
if
the
gun
is
loaded,
5
years.
if
it
isn't,
three.
so
you
have
three
situations,
judge,
sentencing
commission,
congress.
you've
said
congress
can
do
it...
cannot
do
it.
can
the
commission?
can
a
judge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'd
like
to
ask
one
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
when
you
said
mental
state,
isn't
this
motive
a
mental
state
that
is
primarily...
motive
is
a
mental
state
that's
primarily
used
for
sentencing.
i
couldn't
think
of
a
single
statute
where
motive
is
actually
an
element
of
the
crime.
intent
is
a
motive
of
the
crime.
sometimes
intent
does
give
you
a
motive,
but
motive
itself,
he
did
it
out
of
hatred,
he
did
it
out
of
revenge,
he
did
it
out
of
race
hatred,
he
did
it
because
the
person
killed
his
father,
all
those
are
backward-looking,
or
emotional
motives.
i've
never...
can't
think
of
a
single
statute
where
that's
an
element
of
a
crime.
i
mean,
of
course,
there
are
other
states
that
have
made
it
in
this
instance,
but
isn't
it
a
traditionally
sentencing
factor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
terms
of
the
basic
fairness
of
it...
and
i
think
justice
ginsburg
had
a
good
point,
actually.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you've
represented
clients,
i
take
it,
where
sometimes
perhaps
in
your
career
you
had
a
tough
choice.
you
wanted
to
say,
well,
the
client
was
in
chicago,
but
just
in
case
he
wasn't,
i
want
to
tell
you
it
was
only
300
grams
of
drugs
and
not
400.
now,
that...
the
client
sometimes
is
in
an
awkward
situation
with
that
kind
of...
and
why
is
it
fundamentally
unfair
for
congress,
or
a
legislature,
to
say,
look,
race
hatred
is
very
emotional...
very
emotional...
and
you
inject
that
into
the
trial,
and
suddenly
you'll
discover
people
being
very
emotional
about
the
conclusion.
we
think
it's
fairer
for
defendants,
as
well
as
for
victims,
to
take
that
issue
out
and
make
it
a
sentencing
factor
for
the
judge.
is
that
fundamentally
unfair
to
make
that
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
is
fundamentally
unfair,
i
guess
it's
just
as
fundamentally
unfair
if
the
sentencing
commission
makes
it.
in
fact,
it's
worse,
because
it's
not
just
a
maximum,
it's
a
minimum,
or
the
sentence
you're
really
going
to
get,
and
i
guess
it's
even
worse
when
a
judge
does
it,
on
his
own.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
see,
that's
what's
actually
bothering
me,
because
a
mandatory
minimum
is
much
worse
for
defendants
than
an
increase
in
the
maximum.
it's
much
worse,
and
a
sentencing
guideline
which
says,
do
it
in
the
ordinary
case,
is
much
tougher
on
defendants
than
just
increasing
the
statutory
maximum.
we
both
know
that.
and
therefore,
why,
in
terms
of
fairness,
do
you
say
the
constitution
prevents
the
increase
of
the
statutory
max,
not
the
minimum
mandatory,
which
is
much
worse,
and
not
the
sentencing
guideline,
and
not
the
judge
doing
it
on
his
own?
