mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
based
on
three
propositions,
and
i'd
like
simply
to
state
them.
first,
as
this
court's
repeated
application
of
miranda
to
the
states
reveals,
its
rule
is
a
constitutional
one.
second--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
in
that
regard,
and
i
must...
i
will
say
at
the
outset
with
regard
to
all
of
the,
whether
it's
30
or
50
miranda
decisions
this
case
has
decided,
the
court
is
leading,
and
we
are
respectfully
following,
but
the
court
explained
in
miranda
that
the
warnings
themselves
were
not
constitutionally
required,
and
it
repeatedly
invited
legislatures,
including
the
national
legislature,
to
enact
constitutionally
adequate
safeguards.
our
proposition
here
is
that
the
rule
that
the
court
announced
in
miranda,
that
is,
in
the
absence
of
systemically
adequate
safeguards
the
government
can't
use
as
evidence
of
guilt
at
a
criminal
trial
an
unwarned
statement,
must
be
a
constitutional
rule
because
the
court
has
in
dozens
of
cases
applied
it
to
the
state
courts,
at
the
same
time
repeating
that
it
has--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
o'connor,
the
court
itself
has
repeatedly
said
that
miranda's
requirements
are
based
on
its
power
to
interpret
and
apply
the
constitution,
and
that
the
doctrine,
the
court
has
said,
is
necessary.
the
court
said
in
garner
it
was
impelled
to
adopt
the
doctrine
in
order
to
protect,
in
the
distinctive
context
of
custodial
interrogation,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
it
is,
as
the
court
said,
therefore,
in
the
nature
of
a
prophylactic
rule,
that
is,
a
rule
that
when
it
is
violated...
when
the
warnings
themselves
aren't
given,
it
is
not
true
that
the
statement
is
thereby
as
a
matter
of
fact
inevitably
coerced.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--this--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--this
court
held
in
miranda,
and
every
post-miranda
case
that
has
tailored
and
explicated
the
doctrine
is
consistent
with
this
principle,
held
that,
absent
a
narrow
exigency
exception,
a
public
safety
exception,
the
government
may
not
use
as
evidence
of
guilt
at
trial
a
statement
made
in
response
to
custodial
interrogation,
absent
either
warnings
and
a
waiver
or
some
other
systemically
adequate
safeguard.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
the
doctrine
of
miranda,
and
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
i
could
not
agree
with
you
more,
with
an
important
caveat,
and
that
is,
in
miranda
itself
the
court
deliberately,
repeatedly,
and
self-consciously
said,
this
isn't
the
only
rule.
congress
or
the
state
legislatures
may
impose
another
rule,
provided
it
has
adequate
safeguards.
in
other
words...
please
let
me
finish.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
other
words,
what
the
court
said
in
miranda
in
1966
is
what...
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
this
term
in
smith
v.
robbins,
which
is,
when
the
court
acts
in
order
to
protect
a
constitutional
privilege
by
creating
of
the
rule
in
the
absence
of
a
legislative
safeguard,
the
legislature
can
come
in
with
alternatives,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--when
the
court
is
applying
a
rule
pursuant
to
its
authority
to
interpret
and
apply
the
constitution,
congress
can
come
up
with
alternative
ways
to
do
it,
but
it
is
this
court,
under
marbury
v.
madison
and
city
of
boerne,
that
will
ultimately
decide
whether
the
constitution
is
satisfied.
when
this...
when
the
legislature...
when
this
court
comes
up
with
a
rule
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
authority,
as,
for
example,
the
rule
for...
that
the
court...
that
3501
otherwise
does
away
with
with
respect
to
the
consequences
of
pre-indictment
delay,
that
is
self-consciously
a
rule
imposed
on
federal
courts
only
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
authority,
congress
gets
the
last
word.
and
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
were
to
take
up
the
court's
suggestion,
or
any
state
were
to
take
up
the
court's
suggestion
in
miranda
that
it
has
repeated
since
and
come
up
with
alternatives,
and
we've
suggested
some
of
them
at
page
20
of
our
reply
brief,
i
would
be
standing
before
this
court
asking
the
court
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
alternative
safeguards
sufficiently
protected
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
this
distinctive
context.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and
that
actually
is
my...
the
second
point
that
i--
[laughter]
the
second
premise
i
was
going
to
address,
which
is
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
the
third
one
is
that
we
don't
believe
that
the
showing
required
to
overrule
miranda
has
been
made.
the
second
one,
which
really
does
precede
the
third
one,
is
that
section
3501
in
our
view
cannot
be
reconciled
with
miranda
and
therefore
could
be
upheld
by
this
court
only
if
the
court
were
to
be
prepared
to
overrule
miranda.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
in
our
view,
because
it
is
certainly...
it
may
be
very
unusual,
but
it
would
not
be
improper
for
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
to
ask
this
court
to
reconsider
and
overrule
one
of
its
precedents,
although
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
34
years
and,
as
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned,
50
precedents,
but
let
me
just
list
the
four
reasons
why,
in
our
view,
the
court...
the
case
has
not
been
made
to
overrule
miranda
v.
arizona.
first,
we
think
that
stability
in
the
law
is
important,
and
it
is
nowhere
more
important
than
in
this
case,
given
the
court's
extremely
unhappy
experience
with
the
law
of
confessions
under
the
totality-of-the-circumstances,
and
the
certainty
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
miranda
provides.
second,
in
our
view,
miranda,
as
it
has
been
developed
and
tailored
and
refined
by
this
court,
has
proven
workable,
and
its
benefits
to
the
administration
of
justice
have
been
repeatedly
emphasized
by
this
court
and
documented
by
the
court.
third,
in
its...
all
of
its
post-miranda
cases,
this
court
has
reaffirmed
miranda's
underlying
premise,
that
is
that
custodial
interrogation
creates
inherently
compelling
pressures
that
require
some
safeguards.
and
finally,
any
reevaluation
of
miranda
must
take
account
of
the
profoundly
unhappy
experience
of
this
court
that
impelled
its
adoption.
applying
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
in
36
cases
over
30
years
before
1966,
the
court
was
simply
unable
to
articulate
manageable
rules
for
the
lower
courts
to
apply.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
actually
if
the
court
were
applying
its
current
certiorari
standards
a
number
of
those
csaes
would
not
have
been
accepted
for
review,
because
the
articulation
of
the
legal
test
was
set.
the
difficulty
that
this
court
found
was
its
inability
to
expound
the
law,
that
is,
to
give
to
the
lower
federal
courts
a
set
of
articulable,
manageable
rules
that
would
predictably
govern
the
introduction
of
confessions
in
the
case
in
chief.
let
me
just
say
this
in
that
regard.
the
constitutional
test,
i
think
under
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
voluntariness.
it's,
was
this...
did
the
person
speak
in
these
circumstances
as
an
exercise
of
free
will,
or
was
his
will
overborne?
now,
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
was
a
legal
construct,
as
the
chief
justice
mentioned
earlier.
it
was
an...
i
think
it
was
the
chief
justice.
it
was
an
effort
to
impose
legal
rules
on
police
conduct,
and
it,
itself,
included
prophylactic
rules
that
the
court
developed
over
time.
it...
you
know,
if
the
suspect
is
held
more
than
36
hours,
we
don't
want
to
hear
anything
else.
if
violence
was
used
or
threatened--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
i
think
it
was
ashcraft
v.
tennessee,
if
i
have
the
case
right,
or
haynes
v.
washington,
but
i
thought
it
was
justice
jackson
in
dissent
who
said,
some
people
can't...
some
people's
free
will
can't
withstand
36
hours,
but
i
think
this
man's
can.
and
my
only
point
is
that
the
court's
experience
under
the
totality
test
was
that
seemingly
the
more
cases
it
decided,
the
less
actual
guidance
was
provided
to
lower
courts,
and
thereby
to
prosecutors
and
police,
for
what
the
rules
were.
what
is
the
bright-line
legal
standard
that
will
allow
us
to
determine
something,
something
is
admissible
or
not
admissible,
given
the
inherent
difficulty
of
determining
what
actually
occurred
and
what
actually
happened
in
the
mind
of
a
suspect
in
this
very
distinctive
context?
and
we
think...
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
in
determining
whether
to
overrule
miranda
wholesale,
which
is
what
we
think
is
required
in
order
to
uphold
the
statute,
the
court
has
to
take
account,
as
we
have
taken
account,
the
status
quo
ante
and
whether
circumstances
have
changed
so
as
to
return
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
i
agree
that
the
court
in
miranda
relied
on
bram,
but
not
for
that
test,
which
had
not
been
applied
by
this
court
under
the
totality-of-the-circumstances.
the
court
in
miranda
relied
on
bram
for
the
same
proposition
that
the
united
states
relied
on
it
in
miranda
itself,
which
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
in
the
context
of
custodial
interrogation.
that
particular
articulation
of
the
standard
was
not
one
that
was
repeated
by
the
court
in
miranda
or
applied
by
the
supreme
court
under
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
test.
the
court
had
long
since
made
clear
that
what
it
was
looking
at
under
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
was
consistent
with
society's
mores
about
appropriate
police
conduct
and,
balancing
the
need
for
the
ability
of
police
and
prosecutors
to
obtain
and
use
confessions
against
contemporary
standards,
did
the
police
conduct
in
a
particular
case
go
too
far?
and
the
problem
with
the
standard
was
that,
under
the
totality-of-the-circumstances,
everything
is
relevant
and
nothing
is
determinative.
there--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
that's...
as
i
said...
i
don't...
i
doubt
i'll
have
time
to
explicate
this,
but
one
of
the
benefits
that
this
court
has
explained
as
recently
as
in
minnick
and
in
moran
of...
for
law
enforcement
and
for
the
administration
of
justice
generally
is
the
provision
of
rules
that
are
easily
applied
and
understood.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you...
whether
the
number
is
50
or
35,
i
may
not
have
uncovered
them
all,
but
it
is
true
that
as
always
happens
when
the
court
essentially...
thank
you.
