so
then
your
answer
is,
is
that
the
warnings
specified
in
miranda
are
constitutional
requirements,
and
i
thought
you'd
said--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--something
somewhat
different
at
the
very
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
is
3501
deficient
under
that
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
the
basis
for
miranda,
why
don't
we
have
the
same
rule
for
consent?
the
government
doesn't...
for
consent
to
search?
the
government's
never
argued
that
there
should
be
that
rule
for
consent
to
search.
why
do
they
argue
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--requisite
for
miranda?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
right
to
privacy
and
personal
protection
against
seizure
is
not
fundamental?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
really
want
you
to
get
to
your
other
two
points,
but
what
you're
talking
about
just
now
is
something
i
don't
understand.
you
say
the
warnings
are
not
constitutionally
required,
but
the
miranda
rule
is
constitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
standard
wasn't
necessarily
detrimental
to
the
defense,
was
it,
because
there
were
many
approaches
that
the
defense
could
use
to
attack
the
confession.
