mr.
paul
g.
cassell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
turn
immediately
to
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
posed
a
moment
ago,
because
i
think
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
you
have
asked
both
of
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
whether
the
miranda
rights
or
the
miranda
procedures
are
constitutional
requirements,
and
i
think
the
answer
they
gave
was
yes,
which
is
what
they
have
to
say
to
win
this
case.
the
difficulty
with
that
answer
is,
it
would
require
this
court
to
overrule
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
jurisprudence.
to
turn,
for
example,
to
this
court's
holding
in
oregon
v.
elstad,
this
court
refused
to
apply
the
fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree
doctrine,
and
the
reason
it
gave
was
that
a
simple
failure
to
administer
miranda
warnings
is
not,
in
itself,
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
miranda
rule
may
be
triggered
even
in
the
absence
of
a
fifth
amendment
violation,
and
it's
important
to
understand
what
the
holding
in
that
case
was.
the
holding
there
was
that
there
was
no
reason
to
suppress
the
fruit
of
a
non-mirandized
statement
that
is
derivative
evidence,
and
the
reason
this
court
gave
was,
and
again
i
am
quoting,
there
was
no
actual
infringement
of
the
suspect's
constitutional
rights.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
we
think
it
certainly
relates
to
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
it
stems
from...
the
point...
the
way
that
we
would
describe
the
miranda
procedures
is
this.
they
represented
this
court's
provisional,
interim
judgment
about
how
to
go
about
enforcing
fifth
amendment
rights.
now--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--yes.
we
think
it's
very
similar
to
the
anders
requirement,
which
just
3
months
ago
this
court
concluded
could
be
superseded,
and
i
think
the
term
overruled
has
been
used
today.
that
was
not
a
situation
where
california--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
like
the
solicitor
general,
we
have
three
arguments
as
well.
[laughter]
that
is
our
second
argument.
our
first...
there
are
so
many
good
arguments
for
section
3501.
i
hope
i
can
get
them
all
in
here.
their
first
argument
is
simply
that
it
is
this
provisional
interim
judgment
that
the
court
made
that
must
then
recede
when
the
nation's
elected
representatives,
congress,
have
acted.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
you've
certainly
accurately
quoted
the
opinion,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
that
sentence,
those
sentences
that
you
refer
to
were
not
at
all
necessary
to
the
holding
in
this
court's
decision
in
miranda,
and
just--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--when
we
talk
about
court
procedures,
we're
talking
about
a
different
stage
in
the
criminal
justice
process.
the
government
has
shifted
from
investigating
a
crime
to
now
adjudicating
it
in
court,
and
so
that's
why
the
sixth
amendment
procedures--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--there
are
certainly
varying
procedures
around
the
country,
and
that
is
one
of
the
approaches
that's
taken,
but
again,
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
sixth
amendment
rights
attach.
that
is
when
the
government
has
formally
initiated
charges
against
a
suspect.
so
to
go
back
to
the
fifth
amendment
setting--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--i've
testified
before
congress
and
i...
on
miranda,
and
i
actually
did
not
get
my
rights
to
remain
silent--
[laughter]
--when
i
testified.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
so
my
personal
experience
is
no.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
actually,
there
was
a
death
penalty
hearing
where
i
was
sworn
to
tell
the
truth,
but
there
were
no
warnings
given
to
me
at
that
time.
i
think
the
relevant
precedent
here,
justice
ginsburg,
is
minnesota
v.
murphy,
involving
a
parole
officer
who
met
with
a
suspect,
and
this
court
concluded
that
the
general
fifth
amendment
rule
is
that
no
warnings
or
waivers
need
to
be
administered,
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
right
someone
can
assert
by
refusing
to
make--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--i
don't
think...
the
parole
officer
in
that
case
was
asking
mr.
murphy
whether
he
had
committed
a
homicide,
so
i
don't
think
it
was
a
caring
sort
of
relationship
there
and,
indeed,
those
statements
were
used
against
mr.
murphy
later
in
a
prosecution...
for--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--we're
not
saying
that
they're
exactly
the
same,
but
we
are
saying
that
this
court
said,
and
i
believe
this
is
a
paraphrase
of
the
court's
holding
in
murphy,
that
the
general
fifth
amendment
rule
is
that
warnings
and
waivers
are
not
required.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
i
think
the
point
that
we
would
emphasize,
justice
souter,
is
this.
there's
no
question
today
of
going
back
to
the
voluntariness
test.
we're
already
there,
and
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
that.
as
soon
as
the
district
court
judge
concluded
that
miranda
warnings
had
not
been
given
to
mr.
dickerson,
the
next
order
of
business
became
the
voluntariness
inquiry.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
that's
right.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
that's
not
the
way...
that's
our
second
argument.
now,
maybe
i
should
turn
to
that.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
absolutely
correct.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
thirty-four
years.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
there
are
a
number
of
responses,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
you
quoted
words
that
have
become
very
well-known
around
the
world.
many
of
those
same
words
appear
in
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
today,
and
you
could
have
similarly
read
sections
3501(b)(3)
and
(4)
and
(5),
that
talk
very
specifically
about
whether
a
suspect
was
advised
of
certain
rights,
or
had
counsel
present.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
if
i
could
answer
justice
souter's
questions...
question
first,
and
then,
justice
breyer,
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
your
question
as
well.
justice
souter,
our
position
is
this,
that
the
section...
section
3501
enumerated
factors
give
very
clear
incentives
to
law
enforcement
agents
to
deliver
warnings.
in
fact,
the
government's
brief
has--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--there
is
certainly
a
difference.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
general
waxman
has
represented
to
this
court
that
federal
agencies
will
continue
to
deliver
miranda
warnings
should--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--we
think
that
it
provides
a
substitute
adequate--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that
is
adequate.
now,
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
lay
out
in
full
vision
here
our
position
on
this,
and
it
is
laid
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
absolutely.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
fact
one
of
the
sentences
that
has
been
quoted
here
begins
in
a...
or
is
in
the
paragraph
that
begins
with
the
statement,
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
foresee
the
potential
alternatives
that
might
be
devised
by
congress
and
the
states,
so--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--yes.
in
the
absence
of
appropriate
congressional
or
legislative
action,
the
following
procedures
are
prerequisites
to
the
admissibility
of
confessions.
ah,
but
of
course
we
now
have
appropriate
congressional
action.
justice
souter,
to
get
back
to
your
question
about
equally
effective,
we
know
from
the
experience
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
last
year
that
federal
agents
will
continue
to
deliver
warnings.
the
government
has
committed
that
they
will
continue
to
deliver
warnings.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
i
believe
you
are,
with
all
respect,
justice
souter.
the
language
is
tied
to
the
part
of
the
miranda
opinion
that
seems
to
view
custodial
questioning
as
inherently
compelling,
that
is,
automatically
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
without
warnings.
there
are
some
passages
that
can
be
read
that
way.
there
are
now
25
years
of--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--and
in
cases
such
as
elstad,
new
york
v.
quarles,
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned
his
opinion
in
michigan
v.
tucker,
the
court
has
clarified
whatever
ambiguity
may
reside
in
some
of
the
passions...
passages
of
miranda,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
violation.
the
phrase--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
read
carefully,
then,
the
opinion
in
new
york
v.
quarles,
which
we
think
takes
a
different
view.
again,
just
to
quote
one
passage
from
the
opinion,
the
court
held
there
is,
quote,
no
constitutional
imperative
requiring
the
exclusion
in
that
case
of
a
statement
that
was
taken
in
custodial
questioning
that
was
not
in
any
way
preceded
by
a
miranda
warning
or
a
miranda
waiver.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
when
there
has
been
an
actual
constitutional
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights.
section
3501
applies
an
exclusionary
rule
whenever
there
has
been
an
actual
constitutional
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights.
if
mr.
dickerson
could
establish
that
he
had
been
compelled,
if
his
statement
was
involuntary,
the
evidence
would
be
automatically
excluded,
but
this
case
comes
before
this
court
with
a
district
court
finding
that
his
statement
was
voluntary.
that
was
not
disturbed
on
appeal,
is
not
challenged
here
and,
under
new
york
v.
quarles,
oregon
v.
elstad,
harris
v.
new
york,
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
there
is
then
no
abridgement
of
a
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
the--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--the--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--i
believe
nine
courts
of
appeals
around
the
country
have
ruled
on
that
question
and
there's
an
ambiguous
opinion
from
the
ninth
circuit,
but
every
other
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
precisely
the
hypothetical
you
have
given
has
concluded
that
there
is
no
bivens
action,
for
example,
or
1983
action
in
a
state
setting
because
to
violate
the
miranda
procedures
is
in
no
way
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
and
that
is
the--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that
is
part
of
the
miranda
procedures
that
this
court
announced--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that's
the,
as
we
view
it,
the
provisional,
interim
judgment
that
this
court
announced,
and
then
invited
congress
and
the
states
to
consider
other
approaches.
in
section
3501,
congress
has
taken
a
careful
look
at
the
issue--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--we
accept
the
proposition
that
the
alternative
has
to
be
adequate
to
safeguard
constitutional
rights.
it
doesn't
have
to
match
up--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
i
think
i
would
phrase
it
slightly
differently,
justice
souter.
we
agree
that
this
court
must
announce
its
decision
on
whether
there
is
an
adequate
protection
for
constitutional
rights.
smith
v.
robbins
we
think
is
directly
on
point
here.
just
a
few
months
ago
this
court
said,
we
address
not
what
is
prudent
or
appropriate,
but
what
is
constitutionally
compelled,
and
so
you
must
look
at
section
3501
and
see
if
it
secures
a
defendant's
fifth
amendment
rights,
not
whether
it
matches--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--up
to
every
feature
of
miranda.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
no,
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter,
i
very
much
want
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
our--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--we
would--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--i
would
phrase
it
slightly
differently.
again,
to
repeat
my
answer
to
justice
stevens,
which
i
hope
very
much
it
answers
your
question...
i
very
much
want
to
answer
it,
but
i
don't
believe
i
can
accept
your
formulation
of
the
holding
of
miranda,
which
is
why--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--my
formulation
is
this.
in
the
absence
of
congressional
or
legislative
action,
the
following
require...
the
following
measures
are
prerequisites
to
the
admissibilitiy
of
confessions.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
again,
i
would
phrase
it
slightly
differently,
justice
stevens.
they
have
to
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
they
don't
have
to
match
up
to
every
single
jot
and
jiggle
in
the
miranda
warning.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
there
is
a
sentence
in
miranda
which
we
believe
has
been
clarified
in
cases
like
new
york
v.
quarles
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is
no
constitutional
imperative
requiring
the
exclusion
of
unwarned
statements.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
it
was
not
intended
to
overrule
miranda
to
get
to
your
second
question
directly.
it
was--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
i
certainly...
i
don't
know
if
this
court
has
ever
seen
posturing
taking
place
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
justice
legislation.
i
think
there
was
certainly
some
firey
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
the
congress,
but
the
question
is
not
what
congress--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--no,
justice
stevens.
we
believe
that
there
actually
is
direct
language.
to
the
extent
one
wants
to
look
at
legislative
history,
we
would
direct
the
court
to
the
senate
report
number
10-0-8-0
at
page
51.
congress
concluded,
or
the
judiciary
committee
concluded:
the
committee
is
of
the
view
that
the
legislation
proposed
would
be
an
effective
way
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
individual.
the
committee
also
feels
the
constitutional
rights
of
defendants
in
criminal
cases
would
be
fully
protected
and
respected
by
the
safeguards
in
this
proposed
legislation,
and
we
haven't
had
a
chance
to--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
passages
that
i
just
quoted
follow
immediately
on
the
heels
of
a
quotation
that
i
believe
was
the
quotation
that
justice
ginsburg
read,
so
the
court
looked
at
that
quotation,
it
then
looked
at
the
legislation
in
front
of
it,
and
reached
this
conclusion.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
that
passage
has
to
be
viewed
through
the
lens
of
25
years
of
precedents
from
this
court,
and
what
that
lens
reveals
is
that
that
statement
is
not
articulating
constitutional
requirements.
it
is
instead
articulating
a
provisional
judgment
by
this
court
as
to
how
fifth
amendment
rights
can
be
enforced.
congress
has
now
stepped
in
and
provided
its
judgment
as
to
how
to
deal
with
these
issues,
and
we
haven't
had
a
chance
today
to
talk
about
how
section
3501
actually
goes
beyond
some
of
the
miranda
features.
for
example,
in
3501(b)(2),
it
guarantees
that
a
court
will
consider
whether
a
suspect
knew
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him.
in
colorado
v.
spring,
this
court
said
that
was
not
one
of
the
things
to
be
examined
under
the
miranda
doctrine.
under
3501
it
now
will
become
one
of
the
factors,
and
so
one
of
the
results
of
this
court
upholding
the
statute
may
be
that
federal
agents
will
add
an
additional
feature
to
the
miranda
warnings.
it
may
actually
inrease
the
warnings
that
they
deliver.
in
addition,
there
are
tort
remedies
that
have
expanded
over
the
last
20
or
30
years.
the
government
reveals
in
its
brief
that
police
training
and
disciplinary
procedures
are
far
different
today
than
they
were--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--well,
it's
interesting,
here
we
should
not
be
looking
at
what
congress
said.
we
have
to
look
at
what
they
did,
and
this
is
a
case
where
they
actually
did
something
that
i
believe
is
quite
thoughtful.
it
articulates
all
of
the
factors.
what
it
changes
is
this,
justice
stevens.
the
automatic,
rigid
exclusionary
rule
of
miranda.
today,
if
there
is
some
defect
in
the
way
the
miranda
warnings
are
delivered,
or
some
failure
in
this
case...
for
example,
we
had
a
prosecutor
who
failed
to
introduce
the
actual,
signed
statement
of
mr.
dickerson
that
he
had
been
read
his
rights.
in
those
sort
of
technical
situations,
the
miranda
procedures
automatically
require
that
voluntary
statements
be
thrown
out.
and
congress
has
directed
a
more
nuanced
approach.
congress
has
directed
the
courts
to
take
a
look
at
all
of
the
factors,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
failure
to
warn
a
suspect
means
that
the
statement
is
involuntary.
but
it
may
also
be,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
that
the
failure
to
warn
did
not
mean
that
an
involuntary
statement
was
obtained
from
a
suspect.
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
well,
the
dichotomy
we're
trying
to
draw
is
between
actual
violations
of
the
constitutional
right.
every
time
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
operates,
there
has
been
a
judicial
finding
that
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated?
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
that's
a
conceivable
approach.
if
the
congress
provided
a
million
dollar
fine
every
time
a
federal
agent--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--that's
clearly
adequate.
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
many
ways,
certainly
for
innocent
persons
whose
rights
are
violated.
they
get--
mr.
paul
g.
cassell
--thank
you.
