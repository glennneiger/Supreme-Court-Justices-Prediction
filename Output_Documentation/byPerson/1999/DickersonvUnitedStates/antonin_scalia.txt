justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hundley,
are
those
requirements
substantive
requirements?
is
it
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
observe
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
that
if
a
policeman
should
beat
someone
with
a
rubber
hose
and
extract
a
confession,
and
then
introduce
that
confession
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
that
the
policeman
would
be
subject
to
a
civil
action
not
only
for
assault,
but
also
for
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right,
or
fifth
amendment
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
think
that
a
policeman
who
fails
to
mirandize
the
suspect,
obtains
a
confession
without
having
mirandized
them
and
then
introduces
that
confession
in
court,
is
subject
to
suit?
do
you
know
of
any
suit
that
has
ever
been
brought?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
be
very
surprised
if
that
is
prosecutable
civilly,
which
makes
me
think
that
the
right
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
procedural,
is
a
procedural
guarantee
that
the
court
instituted,
rather
than
a
substantive
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
criminal
process,
an
exclusionary
rule,
in
effect,
that
we
won't
let
in
these
confessions.
justice
antonin
scalia
regardless
of
whether
they've
been
technically
extracted
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
as
a
matter
of
criminal
procedure,
we
won't
admit
them,
nor
will
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hundley,
when
you
say
it
replaced
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
analysis,
it
replaced
that,
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
analysis
was
not
a
criterion
of
police
conduct.
it
was
a
criterion
by
which
this
court
evaluated
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
so
you
are
suggesting
that
what
miranda
is
is
not
a
substantive
rule
governing
police
conduct,
but
simply
a
rule
that
the
court
has
adopted
for
all
federal
courts
as
to
how
federal
courts
will
procedurally
determine,
for
purposes
of
admitting
evidence,
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
suggesting
that
we
can't
apply
any
procedural
requirements
upon
state
courts?
we
cannot
compel
the
observance
of
certain
procedural
requirements
by
state
courts
in
the
adjudication
of
federal
constitutional
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
why
don't
we
have...
i
mean,
we
can
certainly
do
it
for
statutory
causes
of
action.
i
mean,
if
title
vii
cases
can
be
brought
in
state
court,
we
can
require
state
courts
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
use
the,
you
know,
prima
facie
burden-shifting
procedures
that
we've
applied
in
federal
court
for
title
vii.
why
can't
we
do
the
same
thing
with
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you're
swallowing
the
camel
and
straining
out
the
gnat.
you're
willing
to
allow...
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
this
power
of
the
court
to
establish
substantive
procedures
for
the
states,
but
you're
not
willing
to
ackowledge
the
much
lesser
power
of
this
court
to
say
how
constitutional
questions
in
state
courts
will
be
adjudicated.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
much
lesser
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
general--
justice
antonin
scalia
--general
waxman,
all
it
takes
to
explain
the
application
of
miranda
to
the
states,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
is
what
gives
the
court
the
power
to
impose
the
rule.
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
if
the
court
has
the
power
to
impose
the
rule
by
reason
of
the
constitution,
congress
cannot
change
that
rule.
in
chapman
v.
california,
which
was
decided
the
term
after
miranda
and
which
also
involved
a
procedural
rule,
we
said,
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
right
of
these
petitioners
not
to
be
punished
for
exercising
their
fifth
amendment
right...
the
issue
was
harmless
error
when
there
was
comment
upon
their
remaining
silent.
the
right
of
these
petitioners,
expressly
created
by
the
federal
constitution
itself,
is
a
federal
right
which,
in
the
absence
of
appropriate
congressional
action,
it
is
our
responsibility
to
protect
by
fashioning
the
necessary
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
has
the
power
to
fashion
procedural
rules,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
once
it
fashions
them
congress
cannot
say,
well,
you
know,
we
think
this
goes
too
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
letting
you
finish.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
glad
you
said...
i'm
glad
you
said,
what
the
court
said,
because
all
of
that
is
dictum.
in
order
to
explain
the
holding
of
miranda
and
the
holding
of
all
subsequent
cases,
no
more
is
necessary
than
what
i
described--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
we
have
the
power
to
do
this,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
change
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
complex
situation
you're
describing
was
a
situation
based
upon
the
standard
we
had
set
forth
in
bram,
which
is
what
miranda
relied
on,
which
was
not
the...
which
has
since
been
rejected.
i
mean,
miranda
said
that
we
need
this
because
it's
too
complex
otherwise
to
apply
the
bram
standard,
which
was
that
a
statement
was
compelled
if
it
was
induced
by
any
threat
or
promise,
or
by
the
exertion
of
any
improper
influence,
however
slight.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
first
point
was,
even
if
it
did,
it
contradicts
nothing
but
dicta
in
miranda
and
not
the
holding
of
miranda.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
cassell,
the
point
was
made
earlier
that
under
3501
you
suggested
there
would
be
an
incentive
for
the
police
to
continue
to
give
the
miranda
warnings,
and
the
point
was
made
that,
however,
they
would
not
be
required.
well,
they
really
aren't
required
under
miranda.
i
mean,
what
happens
if
you
don't
give
them
under
miranda?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
confession
will
be
excluded,
so
it's
really
just
the
same
thing.
you
have
an
incentive
to
give
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
think
that
you
can
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
policeman
who
fails
to
give...
what
is
your
view
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
miranda
said
they
did.
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
miranda
said
they
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
the
constitution...
you
don't
need
a
statute
to
exclude
an
involuntary
confession,
do
you?
doesn't
the
fifth
amendment
do
that
on
its
own?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
order
to
exclude
from
court
a
confession
that
is
known
to
be
involuntary.
that
happens
automatically
with
the
fifth
amendment,
doesn't
it?
