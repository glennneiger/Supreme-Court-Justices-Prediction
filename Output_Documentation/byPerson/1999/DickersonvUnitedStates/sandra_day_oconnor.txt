justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
right?
didn't
we
apply
it
to
state
courts?
it
wasn't
just
a
rule
for
federal
courts,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
miranda
itself
was
from
a
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
our
past
miranda
cases
i
think
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
miranda
warnings
are
not
constitutionally
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
source
of
that
authority
for
the
court--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
how
do
you
equate
it
with
other
exercises
of
such
a
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
isn't
a
fifth
amendment
right
itself,
what
is
it,
and
how
do
we
have
the
power
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
your
view
this
case
boils
down
to
whether
section
3501
is
sufficient--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
like
the
anders
requirements,
for
example,
where
we
imposed
on
states
and
others
certain
requirements
on
appellate
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
an
adequate
alternative
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
your
view
does
this
case
boil
down,
as
i
take
it
the
solicitor
general
also
expresses,
the
notion
that
we
have
to
determine
whether
section
3501
is
an
adequate
alternative?
