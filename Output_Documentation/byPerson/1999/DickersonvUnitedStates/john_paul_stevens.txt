justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
you
get
into
detail
on
that,
tell
us
the
third
one
and
then
argue
the
second.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
could
i
ask
just
one
question.
i
hate
to
complicate
it,
but
i
think
i
can
perhaps
simplify
it.
the
key
question
that
i
don't
think
you've...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position
really.
do
you
contend
that
the
statute
complies
with
the
requirement
of
miranda,
that
it
could
be
a
substitute
adequate
procedure,
or
do
you
think
the
statute
overrules
miranda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
equally
adequate
to
the
miranda
warnings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
then...
one
quick...
would
you
state
the
holding
in
miranda,
in
your
own
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you,
because
i
do
want
to
clarify
just
exactly
what
your
position
is.
would
it
not
be
more
accurate
to
say,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
or
a
legislative
holding
that
satisfies
the
requirement
that
these
warnings
satisfy
it,
isn't
that
what
they
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
absolutely
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
finish
up,
because
i'm
really...
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
position
as
accurately
as
i
can.
is
it
your
view
that
3501
was
an
effort
to
comply
with
the
miranda
suggestion
that
equivalent
standards
can
be
enacted
by
law,
or
is
it
your
view
that
3501
was
intended
to
overrule
miranda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
so,
that
senator
mcclellan
and
senator
ervin
at
that
time
had
that
in
mind
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
that
legislative
history
that
suggests
they
thought
they
were
providing
a
substitute
for
the
guarantees
that
miranda
provided,
that
rather,
they...
it
seems
to
me
they
said
they
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
old
voluntariness
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
statement
that
can
be
read
as
saying,
we
think
miranda
went
farther
than
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
make
a
wonderful
argument
on
a
lot
of
points,
but
i
think
it's
going
to
be
tough
to
convince
me
that
3501
was
intended
to
expand
the
protection
granted
by
miranda--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
you
seem
to
be
arguing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
it
doesn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
doesn't
call
for
the
inadmissibility
of
an
involuntary
confession.
it
just
prescribes
that
it
must
be
admitted
if
it's
voluntary.
it
doesn't
even
purport
to
be
exclusionary
at
all.
