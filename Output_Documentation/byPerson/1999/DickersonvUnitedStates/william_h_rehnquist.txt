we'll

argument
now
in

99-5525,
charles

dickerson
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
hundley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
hundley,
you
say
shifted.
you
don't
mean
superseded,
i
take
it,
because
i
think
the
voluntariness
rule
of
previous
cases
still
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
a
confession
that
is
not
voluntarily
extracted
is
nonetheless
a...
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it
provides
clear-cut
evidence.
i
looked
into
the
number
of
cases
that
we
have
had
construing
miranda,
and
there
are
about
50
of
them,
so
that
to
say
that
it's
easily
applied
is
just
a
myth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hundley.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
general
waxman,
that
may
have
just
been
a
misexercise
of
the
certiorari
jurisdiction.
perhaps
the
court
shouldn't
have
granted
all
those
cases,
realizing
that
it
was
a
rather
vague
concept.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
36
hours
was
a
federal
rule.
it
was
not
imposed
on
the
states.
you're
talking
about
mcnabb?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
cassell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cassell,
i
think
you
can
point
to
other
cases,
too,
including
one
which
i
authored,
michigan
v.
tucker,
that
refers
to
it
as
a
prophylactic
rule,
but
here
we're
kind
of
faced
with
a
conundrum.
if
the
rule
can
be
applied
to
state
courts,
as
it
was
in
miranda,
how
can
it
be
that
it
doesn't
originate
in
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
what
does
relates...
does
that
mean
something
different
than
arises
out
of,
or
stems
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
at
a
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
cassell,
with
respect
to
the
quotation
justice
breyer
read
you,
were
there
any
rule-making
proceedings
before
the
court
in
miranda?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
dicta,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cassell,
do
you
see
the
miranda
holding,
or
ruling,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
as
differently
based
than
the
exclusionary
rule
under
mapp
v.
ohio?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cassell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hundley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.

these
four
warnings
that
accord
to
police
stations
and
on
television
screens.
in
the
34
years
since
we
decided
the
case
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
in
that
opinion
we
held
that
any
statement
a
suspect
makes
while
in
police
custody
is
not
admissible
in
the
prosecution’s
case
in
chief,
unless
the
statement
was
preceded
by
these
warnings.
the
present
case
dickerson
addresses
whether
miranda
has
been
superseded
by
an
act
of
congress
passed
in
1968.
we
hold
that
miranda
is
a
constitutional
decision
that
may
not
be
overruled
by
congress
and
we
decline
to
overrule
miranda
ourselves.
we
therefore
hold
that
miranda
and
its
progeny
continue
to
govern
the
admissibility
of
statements
made
during
custodial
interrogation.
petitioner
charles
dickerson
was
indicted
for
bank
robbery
and
related
federal
crimes.
before
trial
he
moved
to
suppress
an
incriminatory
statement
he
made
at
an
fbi
field
office
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
received
miranda
warnings.
the
district
court
granted
his
motion
to
suppress.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
that
his
statement
was
taken
in
violation
of
miranda,
but
concluded
that
the
statement
should
nevertheless
be
admitted
because
miranda
had

section
3501,
a
statute
passed
by
congress
in
1968.
section
3501
displays
miranda’s
specific
warnings
requirement
with
a
test
that
looks
to
whether
given
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
a
suspect's
statement.
the
statement
was
voluntarily
given.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
we
granted
certiorari.
it’s
well-established
that
the
constitution
proscribes
the
admission
of
any
confession
that
is
obtained
involuntarily.
we
have
never
abandoned
that
requirement,
but
since
miranda,
in
1966,
we
have
also
enforced
the
rule
that
any
custodial
statement
must
be
preceded
by
specific
warnings
to
be
admissible
in
the
prosecutions
case
in
chief.
because
3501,
the
act
of
congress
seeks
to
abandon
miranda’s
warning
requirement
and
return
to
voluntariness,
this
case
turns
on
whether
congress
has
constitutional
authority
to
supersede
miranda.
the
law
in
this
area
is
clear.
congress
has
authority
to
supersede
non
constitutional
judicially
created
rules
of
evidence
and
procedure,
but
congress
may
not
legislatively
overrule
our
decisions
interpreting
and
applying
the
constitution.
the
dispositive
question
therefore
is
whether
the
miranda
court
announced
a
constitutional
rule
or
merely
exercised
its
supervisory
authority
to
regulate
evidence
in
the
absence
of
congressional
direction.
for
a
number
of
reasons
we
think
it
clear
that
miranda’s
rule
is
constitutionally
based.
first,
both
miranda
and
two
of
its
companion
cases
applied
the
new
warning
requirements
to
proceedings
in
state
courts.
we
do
not
have
a
supervisory
power
over
the
courts
of
the
state
and
may
only
require
those
tribunals
to
comply
with
the
dictates
of
the
federal
constitution.
second,
the
miranda
opinion
itself
is
replete
with
statements
indicating
that
the
court
thought
it
was
announcing
a
constitutional
rule.
third,
while
the
miranda
court
invited
legislative
action
to
protect
the
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination,
it
specified
that
such
legislation
must
be
effective
in
apprising
the
accused
of
their
right
of
silence.
the
fact
that
our
post
miranda
cases
have
made
exceptions
from
its
rule
does
not
demonstrate
that
miranda
was
not
a
constitutional
decision.
these
decisions
illustrate
the
principle
not
that
miranda
is
not
a
constitutional
rule,
but
that
no
constitutional
rule
is
immutable.
no
court
laying
down
a
general
rule
can
possibly
foresee
the
various
circumstances
in
which
counsel
will
seek
to
apply
it.
the
sort
of
modifications
represented
by
these
cases
are
as
much
a
normal
part
of
constitutional
law
as
the
original
decision.
we
reject
the
arguments
of
section
3501
complies
with
miranda’s
requirement.
the
legislative
alternative
be
equally
as
effective
in
preventing
coerced
confessions.
there
are
more
measures
enforced
today
than
there
were
in
1966
to
allow
some
of
these
protections,
but
section
3501
expressly
abandons
the
requirement
of
pre-interrogation
warnings
in
favor
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
it
simply
does
not
comply
with
miranda’s
intimation
that
other
methods,
other
than
those
four
warnings,
would
satisfy
the
constitutional
demand.
having
concluded
that
congress
may
not
overrule
miranda,
we
decline
to
overrule
it
ourselves.
whether
or
not,
we
would
agree
with
miranda’s
reasoning
and
its
resulting
rule,
were
we
addressing
the
issue
in
the
first
instance,
the
principles
of
stare
decisis
weigh
heavily
against
overruling
it
now.
miranda
has
become
embedded
in
routine
police
practices
to
the
point
where
the
warnings
that
become
part
of
our
national
culture.
while
we
have
overruled
our
precedents
when
subsequent
cases
have
undermined
their
doctrinal
underpinnings.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
has
happened
to
the
miranda
decision.
if
anything,
our
subsequent
cases
have
reduced
the
impact
of
the
miranda
rule
on
legitimate
law
enforcement
while
reaffirming
the
decision’s
core
ruling.
the
disadvantage
of
the
miranda
rule
is
that
statements
which
may
be
by
no
means
involuntary
made
by
a
defendant
who
is
aware
of
his
rights,
may
nonetheless
be
excluded
and
a
guilty
defendant
go
free
as
a
result.
but
experience
suggests
that
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
which
section
3501
seeks
to
revive
is
more
difficult
than
miranda
for
law
enforcement
officers
to
conform
to,
and
for
courts
to
apply
in
a
consistent
manner.
the
requirement
that
miranda
warnings
be
given
does
not,
of
course
dispense
with
the
voluntariness
inquiry,
but
as
we
have
said
in
a
previous
case,
cases
in
which
a
defendant
can
make
a
colorable
argument
that
a
self-incriminating
statement
was
compelled
despite
the
fact
that
the
law
enforcement
authorities
adhered
to
the
dictates
of
miranda
are
rare.
for
all
these
reasons
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
