justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
exactly
the
point
which
i
think
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
souter
were
getting
at.
justice
ginsburg
quoted
one
sentence
of
miranda.
it
has
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
what?
it
has
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
probably
words
that
i
think
probably
2
billion
people
throughout
the
world
know.
he
must
be
warned,
prior
to
any
questioning,
that
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent,
that
anything
he
says
can
be
used
against
him
in
a
court
of
law,
that
he
has
the
right
to
the
presence
of
an
attorney,
and
that
if
he
cannot
afford
an
attorney,
one
will
be
appointed
for
him.
all
right?
now,
that's
a
hallmark
of
american
justice
in
the
last...
30
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
at
the
end
of
that,
and
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
focus
on,
the
court
is
asked,
why
don't
you
let
the
states
or
rule-making...
other
rule-making
bodies
figure
out
how
to
enforce
the
fifth
amendment,
and
these
are
the
words
ending
the
opinion,
not
some
obscure
phrase
buried
in
dicta:
where
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
are
involved,
there
can
be
no
rule-making
or
legislation
that
would
abrogate
them,
end
of
the
body
of
the
opinion.
now,
given
that
phrase,
and
those
rights
set
forth
with
clarity,
what
is
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
namely,
that
miranda
itself
says
that
the
phrase
that
i
read,
or
the
equivalent,
is
demanded
by
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
argument,
though?
i
mean,
one
argument
would
be,
those
words
are
the
equivalent.
