justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
cassell,
could
i
go
back
to
what
i
think
was
the
kernel
of
justice
ginsburg's
original
question,
and
that
was,
she
stated
an
understanding
of
miranda
which
is
my
understanding,
too,
and
that
was
that
the
experience
with
a
system
based
purely
on
inquiries
into
voluntariness
had
been
sufficiently
unsatisfactory
that
the
court
said
in
miranda,
we
are
going
to
go
to
a
somewhat
different
system
which
we
think
will
produce
better
results.
the
justification
for
going
to
that
system
is
that
we
understand
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
an
application
in
the
station
house
as
well
as
in
the
courtroom.
because
it
does,
we
are
going
to
go
from
a
system
that
inquires
solely
into
voluntariness
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
to
a
system
which
inquires
in
the
first
instance
about
knowing
waiver
of
fifth
amendment
rights
and
we
accept,
the
court
said,
the
proposition
that
there
may
be
other
ways
to
do
this.
we
would
accept
the
possibility
of
equivalents.
but
i
think...
and
this
is
where
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
i
understood,
when
the
court
talked
about
equivalents,
that
it
was
talking
about
equivalents
to
this
knowing
waiver
kind
of
system,
and
the
problem
that
we
have
with
the
statute
here
is
that
it
seems
to
go
from
the
necessity
of
a
knowing
waiver
system,
when
the
statement
is
to
be
used
in
a
case
in
chief,
back
to
a
voluntariness
system,
and
that
does
not
seem
to
be
an
equivalent,
either
in
fact
or
in
law,
as
miranda
was
using
it.
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
voluntariness
system
alone.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
and
the
statute
goes
back
to,
i
guess,
a
voluntariness
system
alone.
justice
david
h.
souter
i've
given
you
a
golden
opportunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
do
not
require
it.
they
consider
it
simply
as
a
factor,
and
whatever
else
may
be
clear,
it
is
clear
that
that
is
not
the
equivalent
to
which
miranda
referred,
as
justice
breyer
just
quoted
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
incentive
is
not
required.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
bet.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
will
assume
that
that
is
going
to
be
so
in
most
cases.
i
mean,
there
are
good
reasons
to
continue
to
deliver
the
warnings.
i
think
we
probably
all
agree
with
that.
but
i
guess
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
point
that
we're
all
addressing
in
one
way
or
another,
and
that
is,
one
may
say,
well,
the
statement
that
an
equivalent
and
only
an
equivalent
will
do
is...
was
dictum
in
miranda,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
really
gets
to
the
heart
of
it,
because
i
undertand
miranda
to
have
held
and
to
have
explained
that
the
delivery
of
these
warnings
and
the
securing
of
a
knowing
waiver
is
constitutionally
necessary
to
serve
the
substantive
constitutional
standards.
if
that
is
so,
and
if
we
continue
to
accept
that
proposition
as
so,
then
it
necessarily
follows
that
anything
that
might
substitute
for
miranda,
assuming
that...
the
miranda
warnings,
assuming
that
possibility,
have
got
to
be
an
equivalent.
so
you
can
say,
well,
it
was
dictum
for
them
to
say
that,
because
no
one
was
proposing
an
equivalent,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
necessarily
follows
from
the
miranda
holding,
and
it
has
therefore
the
same
precedential
dignity
that
the
basic
holding
had.
is...
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not...
i
don't
know
that
it
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
automatically
coercive
in
the
sense
that
you
would
automatically
draw
the
conclusion
that
coercion
was
involved,
but
that
there
was
invariably
a
coercive
effect.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
getting
at,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
passage
in
the
constitution
that
says,
you
have
to
give
these
warnings,
but
those
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
have
not
overruled
or
jettisoned
the
proposition
that,
in
order
to
get
to
a
constitutionally
mandated
result
with
sufficient
assurance
that
the
constitution
is
being
served,
we
are
going
to
require,
as
a
matter
of
practical
necessity,
the
giving
of
these
warnings.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
just
number
two,
we
are
there...
for
that
reason
we
are
going
to
go
to
a
waiver-based,
knowing
waiver-based
system,
and
i
don't
think
those
cases
have
jettisoned
those
propositions.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
accept
the
proposition
that
they
are
required
if
you
want
to
get
the
statement
in
in
the
case
in
chief?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
required
under
miranda
if
you
want
to
get
the
statement
in
as
part
of
your
case
in
chief?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
the
holding
of
miranda,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
absent
the
conclusion
from
this
court
that
another
approach
provides
the
equivalence,
the
miranda
warning
and
the
knowing
waiver
is
a
necessity
if
the
statement
is
to
be
admitted
as
part
of
the
state's
case
in
chief
to
prove
guilt.
you
accept
that
proposition,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
my
question.
my
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--assumed
that,
in
the
absence
of
something
that
was
found
to
be
equivalent,
the
warnings
and
the
knowing
waiver
are
necessities
for
admissibility
if
the
statement
is
to
be
used
in
the
case
in
chief
to
prove
guilt,
and
you...
i...
you
do
accept
that
proposition,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
understand
your
point.
i
think
you
don't
want
to
answer
the
question,
and
i
will
take
that
as
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my
question
is
just
simply
an
understanding
of
what
miranda
held--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
it
goes
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
necessity,
and
my
point
is
that
miranda
held,
as
i
understand
it,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
conclusion
that
there
was
an...
a
constitutionally
equivalent
procedure,
the
warnings
and
finding
of
knowing
waiver
are
in
fact
necessities
for
the
admission
of
the
statement
to
prove
guilt.
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
do
accept
that,
that
that's
what
miranda
held,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
formulation?
