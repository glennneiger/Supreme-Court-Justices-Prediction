mr.
james
w.
hundley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
thirty-four
years
ago,
in
miranda
v.
arizona,
this
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
required
that
police
interrogators
fully
inform
a
suspect
of
their
rights
under
the
privilege
and
provide
them
a
full
opportunity
to
exercise
those
rights.
the
question
before
the
court
today
asks
whether
congress
has
the
authority
to
legislatively
overrule
and
reverse
this
court's
decision
in
miranda.
the
key
to
this
question
turns
on
whether
the
requirements
of
miranda
are
constitutionally
based
and
therefore
immune
from
legislative
modification,
or
are
something
else:
as
the
foruth
circuit
ruled,
a
mere
exercise
of
the
court's
power
to
prescribe
rules
and
procedures
for
courts.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes,
justice
scalia.
while
the
specific
warnings
articulated
in
miranda
themselves
are
not
constitutionally
mandated,
the
constitutional
threshhold
represented
by
those
warnings
is
constitutionally
required.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
i
am
unaware
of
any...
well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
take
that
back.
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
is
currently
wrestling
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
intentional
disregard
of
an
individual's
exercise
of
his
rights
under
miranda
could
constitute
a
civil
action.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes.
the
requirements
of
miranda
are
constitutional
protections
that
the
court--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--well--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--i
would
respond,
your
honor,
that
they
cannot
be
submitted
because
they
were
obtained
without
the
requisite
protections
that
the
constitution
demands
to
ensure
their
voluntariness,
to
dispel
the
inherent
compulsion--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--the--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--i
did,
and
it's
a
subtle
distinction,
justice
kennedy,
and
it's
a
distinction
i
think
which
has
perhaps
led
to
some
confusion
in
the
literature.
the
constitutional
requirement
of
miranda
is
that
there
be
protective
procedures
in
place
to
fully
inform
a
suspect
of
his
rights,
so
that
he
knows
his
rights,
so
that
he
knows
he
can
exercise
those
rights,
he
knows
that
his
interrogators
will
honor
those
rights,
and
so
that
the
court
will
know
that
any
waiver
of
those
rights
was
made
knowingly
and
intentionally,
not
just
voluntarily.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
because
3501,
rather
than
requiring
affirmative
objective
procedures
which
provide
notice
to
the
defendant
and
provide
protections
for
the
suspect,
simply
reverts
the
analysis
back
to
the
totality-of-circumstances
test,
which
courts
in
this
country
wrestled
with
for
many
decades
until
miranda
explicitly
rejected
it
as
unworkable
and
inconsistent.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
miranda
court
specifically
shifted
the
focus
of
the
analysis
from
the
traditional
due
process,
totality-of-the-circumstances
case
to
a
more
objective,
concrete,
clear-cut
procedure
whereby
procedures
had
to
be
in
place
to
ensure
that
the
individual
knew
his
rights,
knew
his
interrogators
would
honor
those
rights,
and
to
provide
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
those
rights.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
in
a
rare
case,
a
confession
that
were
obtained
following
miranda
warnings
could
still
be
deemed
involuntary
if
physical
coercion
were
present,
or
other
forms
of
coercion
that
overbore
the
will
of
the
individual,
but
the
benefit
of
the
miranda
rule
is
that
it
in
most
instances
provides
clear-cut
evidence
for
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
in
fact
perhaps
my
understanding
of
the
case
law
as
it's
developed
has
demonstrated
that
while
initially
when
the
miranda
requirements
were
new,
cases
were
coming
before
the
court
more
steadily.
they
have
since
slowed
down,
and
certainly
comparing
that
to,
under
the
old
totality-of-the-circumstances
analysis,
the
court
was
consistently
wrestling
with
the
issue
on
almost
every
term.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes.
it
is
a--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--oh,
no.
it
has
consistently,
since
its
inception,
been
applied
to
state
courts.
i--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--yes,
it
was,
as
were
numerous
other
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
and
tailoring
the
decision,
and
the
fact--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--only
those
procedures
which
themselves
are
demanded
by
the
constitution.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
well,
justice
scalia,
in
that
example,
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
the
court's
federal
statutory
jurisdiction,
but
in
cases
such
as
miranda,
unless
the
court
is
interpreting
and
applying
the
constitution,
its
procedures
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
states
unless
the
court
were
to
embrace
the
theory
put
forth
by
a
court-appointed
amicus
that
there
is
some
form
of
constitutional
common
law,
which
this
court
to
my
knowledge
has
never
recognized,
and--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--justice
scalia,
i
would
disagree.
to
interpret
the
constitution
and
to
determine
the
protections
which
are
to
be
required
under
the
constitution
is
perhaps
the
greatest
power
of
this
court.
it
is
the
power
that
this
court
recognized
in
marbury
v.
madison.
it
is
a
power
which
underlies
one
of
the
most
basic
tenets
of
federalism
of
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
yes,
i
agree,
justice--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--no,
justice--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--excuse
me,
justice
kennedy.
in
schneckloth
the
court
provided
an
excellent
analysis
of
the
difference
between
the
two
rights.
it
ultimately
comes
down
to
this
court's
determination
of
which
rights
are
fundamental
to
the
individual,
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
proceeding
with
a
fair
criminal
trial,
which
the
court
has
recognized--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--not
in
the
context
of
maintaining
a
fair
criminal
trial,
because
the
evidence
found
in
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
while
there
may
be
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
is
probative
to
guilt
or
innocence.
it's
been...
the
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
described
by
this
court
not
as
individual
rights
so
much
as
societal
rights
to
protect
them
from...
to
protect
individuals'
privacy,
whereas
the
individual...
the
fifth
amendment
privileges
are
specific,
fundamental
individual
rights,
which
in
the
inherently
compulsive
context
of
custodial
interrogation
need
additional
protection.
if
i
may,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me,
just
in
response
to
mr.
cassell's
argument
that
this
was
a
mere
technical
violaton
by
the
police
officers
conducting
this
investigation,
respond
that
we
firmly
believe
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
factual
finding
that
the
police
failed
to
appropriately
apprise
mr.
dickerson
of
his
rights
that
it
wasn't
simply
a
mistake
by
the
prosecutor
to
introduce
evidence.
there
was
no
evidence.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
this
court
that
sets
the
limits
of
the
bill
of
rights
including
the
fifth
amendment,
not
congress.
in
miranda,
this
court
set
a
constitutional
minimum.
congress
didn't
attempt
to
meet
that
minimum.
rather,
they
attempted
to
roll
the
clock
back
and
reverse
it,
and
reimpose
totality-of-the-circumstances.
this
is
the
reason
section
3501
fails.
i
would
agree
with
justice
o'connor's
question
that
this
case
boils
down
to
the
sufficiency
of
3501...
does
it
meet
the
standards
set
forth
in
miranda
+/?
and
it
does
not.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
it
clearly
does
not.
mr.
james
w.
hundley
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--but
this
court
in
miranda
clearly
defined
that
the
fifth
amendment
needed
additional
protections
to
be
fully
effective,
to
be
more
than
a
formal--
mr.
james
w.
hundley
--that's
correct.
if
a
warned
statement
is
found
to
be
involuntary,
it
is
excluded,
but
that
is
really...
the
strength
and
clarity
of
the
miranda
rule
is
that
it
provides
guidance
for
the
police,
it
provides
guidance
for
the
courts,
and
it
protects
the
individual's
rights.
that's
all
i
have,
your
honors.
thank
you.
