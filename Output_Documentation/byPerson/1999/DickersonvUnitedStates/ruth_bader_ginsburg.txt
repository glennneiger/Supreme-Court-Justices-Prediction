justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hundley,
as
i
understand
it,
miranda
made
a
switch
from
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
that
related
to
due
process,
don't
give
people
the
third
degree,
to
something
quite
different,
and
i'm
not
sure
you're
explicit
about
it.
that
is,
miranda
for
the
first
time
put
this
right
under
the
first...
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
it
became
a
right
to
notice
and
opportunity
to
exercise
your
rights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
a
right
to
be
free
from
third
degree
procedures,
but
a
right
to
notice,
and
opportunity
to
exercise
your
right
to
silence,
and
that
that
was
an
interpretation
of
what
the
self-incrimination
privilege
required,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hundley,
i
think
you
are
getting
away
now
from
what
i
thought
you
had
established
clearly
before,
that
what
we're
talking
about
now
is
something
that's
discrete
from
and
in
addition
to
voluntariness,
that
is,
notice
and
opportunity
to
exercise
your
right
of
silence,
and
i
don't
think
those
two
should
be
blended
together,
because
what
made
miranda
different
was
not
that
it
did
away
with
the
voluntariness
law,
but
that
it
recognized
a
discrete
right,
a
procedural
right,
if
you
will,
but
a
constitutional
right
to
notice
and
opportunity
of
your
right
to
silence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cassell,
before
you
proceed
with
that,
may
i
ask
what
you
do...
we
are
dealing
with...
miranda
is
the
bedrock
decision,
and
the
court
repeatedly
said,
unless
we
are
shown
other
procedures
which
are
at
least
as
effective,
effective
to
do
what?
effective
to
apprise
accused
persons
of
their
right
of
silence
in
assuring,
and
in
assuring
a
continuous
opportunity
to
exercise
it.
i
think
the
miranda
decision
said
that
three
times,
that
what
was
being
protected
by
these
preventative
rules
was
the
right
of
the
accused
person
to
know
that
he
could
remain
silent
and
would
have
an
opportunity
to
exercise
that
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
miranda
said
the
police
station,
station
house,
is
a
fifth
amendment
venue
in
the
same
way
a
court
is,
in
the
same
way
a
legislative
committee
that's
inquiring
into
something
that
may
lead
to
a
criminal
indictment,
and
in
those
settings...
take
the
court,
whether
it's
the
first
appearance
before
a
magistrate,
whether
it's
a
guilty
plea,
that's
written
right
into
the
rules
of
what
the
court
must
advise
the
defendant,
the
right
to
remain
silent,
that
statements
can
be
used
against
him,
the
right
to
counsel.
whenever
a
defendant
is
before
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
the
defendant
will
be
of
course
given
that
information,
and
i
thought
that
miranda
said,
well,
the
police
station
is
also
a
fifth
amendment
venue
in
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't...
the
initial
presentation
before
a
magistrate,
there's
no
trial
yet.
that's
much
further
down
the
line.
but
isn't
that
what
the
magistrate
has
to
say
to
any
defendant
brought
before
the
magistrate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
what
miranda's
whole
point
was,
that
we're
going
to
treat
the
station
house
as
that
kind
of
forum,
or
perhaps
you
can
tell
me,
because
i
really
don't
know,
what
is
done
by
a
legislative
investigating
committtee
when
they
are
investigating
something
that
could
lead
to
the
criminal
prosecution
of
certain
witnesses.
do
legislative
committees
inform
witnesses
before
them
of
their
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
doubt
that
you
were
in
any
jeopardy
at
all
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
there,
wasn't
it
the
parole
officer
had
a
relationship,
kind
of
a
caring,
fatherly
relationship
with
the...
as
distinguished
from
the
police
encounter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
you...
the
parole
officer
is
supposed
to
be
there
to
help
rehabilitate
the
person.
the
police
are
trying
to
find
out
if
a
crime
was
committed,
and
who
committed
it.
the
settings
are
not
the
same,
are
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cassell--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you...
you
heard
one
quote
from
justice
breyer.
i
gave
you
another
one.
you
have
restated
what
you
thought
was
the
miranda
holding.
another
statement
in
miranda:
procedural
safeguards
must
be
employed
to
protect
the
privilege
unless
other
fully
effective
means
are
adopted.
adopted
to
do
what?
to
notify
the
person
of
his
right
to
silence,
and
to
assure
that
the
exercise
of
the
right
will
be
scrupulously
honored,
the
following
measures
are
required,
and
the
court
said,
we're
not
saying
that
it
must
be
these
particular
warnings.
it
said,
there
might
be
others,
but
they
had
to
be
adequate
substitues,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
thing
that
miranda
would
not
permit,
if
you
are
following
that
decision
honestly,
is
to
go
back
to
a
totalitarian--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
totality-of-the-circumstances
test.
we
just
mix
everything
up
and
come
out
however
the
particular
decisionmaker
wants
to
come
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
answer
you
gave
to
the
chief
justice
about
the
distinction
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
self-incrimination
miranda
rule?
i
thought
you
were
taking
the
position
that
rights
are
for
this
court
to
declare,
but
that
remedies
are
for
congress
to
determine,
and
if
that's
the
dichotomy,
rights,
but
how
you
implement
them
is
ultimately
a
legislative
judgment,
then
why
wouldn't
it
follow...
why
wouldn't
your
agument
apply
just
as
well
to
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
couldn't
the
legislature
say,
fine,
but
the
remedy
is,
you
have
a
great
tort
action
against
the
officers
who
engaged
in
unlawful
search
and
seizure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
picking
a
million
dollar
because
you
think
that's
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you're
not
making
the--
