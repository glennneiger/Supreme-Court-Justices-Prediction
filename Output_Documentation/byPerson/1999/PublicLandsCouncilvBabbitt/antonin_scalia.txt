you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
i
don't
understand
is,
you
acknowledge
that
it's
within
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
reduce
you
below
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
i
don't
understand
what
you're
asking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it
the
secretary
deprived
you
of
that
you
want
to
be
given?
you
don't
assert
any
right
to
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
does
it
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
was
that
language
that
you
just
quoted,
additions
to...
i
mean,
i'm
looking
on
9a.
i
don't
see
it.
i
want
to
underline
significant
passages.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
claims
would
it
give
you?
give
me
an
example,
a
concrete
example
of
how
you
would
be
better
off
if
you
had
this
supplemental
preference
which
he
didn't
always
give
you
in
the
past
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
say
that
that
theoretical
amount
gave
you
an
absolute
right,
if
you
had
five,
five
livestock
owners
whose
total
preference
amount
adds
up
to
100
percent
of
a
particular
grazing
area,
it
in
effect,
even
though
they
weren't
using
the
whole
100
percent,
even
though
they
were
only
using
80
percent...
that
was
the
active
preference,
okay...
nonetheless
the
inactive
preference...
what's
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suspended
preference
would
give
them
an
absolute
right
to
exclude
a
sixth
livestock
owner
from
coming
in,
or
not?
if
not,
then
i
don't
know
what
the
preference
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
an
area
where,
when
you
take
the
total
preference
amount,
its
100
percent
use--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
do
have
an
absolute
right
to
exclude
a
live...
a
new
grazer.
justice
antonin
scalia
100--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
graze
100--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
he
can't
give
it
to
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
preference
amount,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
also
reduce
the
suspended
use,
you
can't
you,
if
you
want
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
on
renewal?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
mean
under
the
old
system,
never
mind
under
the
current--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
regulations
would
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
