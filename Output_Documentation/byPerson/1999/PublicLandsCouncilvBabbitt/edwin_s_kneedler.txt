mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
have
chosen
to
bring
a
facial
challenge
to
these
regulations,
and
they
may
succeed
on
a
facial
challenge
only
if
they
can
show
that
there
is
no
set
of
circumstances
in
which
the
regulations
would
be
valid.
they
have
fallen
far
short
of
doing
that.
in
fact,
the
regulations
reflect
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
flpma,
the
federal
land
policy
management
act,
and
the
public
rangelands
improvements
act,
and
they
fall
well
within
the
broad
discretion
that
congress
necessarily
conferred
on
the
secretary
to
manage
the
vast
public
domain
for
multiple
use
and
sustained
use--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
in
a
facial
challenge,
we
think
that's
right,
but
i
would
like
to
respond,
because
we
think
these
regulations
are
valid
across
the
board.
there
may
be
individual
situations
in
which
a
particular
permittee
may
have
his
active
use
cut
back,
or
may...
during
the
term
of
the
permit
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that...
of
course,
the
court
could
write
the
opinion
as
it
chose,
and
i
suppose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
[laughter]
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
i
think
that
is
essentially--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
if
the
claim
is
that
the
regulation
is
completely
beyond
the
statutory
authority,
no,
that
is
true.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no,
i'm
agreeing
with
you,
as
far
as
i
know,
if
the
claim
is
that
the
regulation
is
that
the
regulation
would
be
beyond
the
secretary's
authority
in
all
of
its
applications.
but
as
i
understand
petitioner's
fundamental
point,
it
is
that
in
the
land
use
planning
process,
which
is
based
on
principles
of
multiple
use,
that
the
grazing
that
they
have
previously
been
permitted
to
engage
in
will
not
be
adequately
respected,
or
taken
into
account,
or
weighed
into
the
balance.
that
is
essentially
a
challenge
to
the
broad
land
use
planning
that
flpma
itself
mandates
for
grazing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
that
is
simply
not
true,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no,
excuse
me...
that
the
new
regulations
do
not
provide
for
an
apportionment
if
there
is
an
increase
in
grazing,
and
that's
the
example
the
petitioner--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--okay.
if
i
may
respond,
and
two
points.
first,
what
they
are
describing
is
a
prior
regulatory
regime,
not
something
that
the
statute
requires.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so
to
the
extent
that
they
are
claiming
some
inconsistency
with
the
statute,
that's
not
this
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this...
and
with
respect
to
the
new
grazer
coming
in,
those
regulations
are,
as
were
pointed,
out
in
regulation
4110.3-1.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
are
essentially
unchanged,
and
that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
prior
regulations
appear
at
9a
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
addendum
to
the
brief.
4110...
excuse
me....3-1,
increasing
active
use,
the...
excuse
me.
those
are
the
prior
regulations.
the
1995
regulations
appear
on
page
123
of
the
petition
appendix,
and
the
title
has
just
been
changed
to
increasing
permitted
use,
rather
than
increasing
active
use,
but
the
force
of
the
regulations
is
the
same.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
123a
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
if
you
put
them
side-by-side,
there
is
actually
essentially
no
change
in
the
allocation
of
additional
forage
as
it
becomes
available,
and
the
same
is
correspondingly
true
with
respect
to
a
decrease
in
forage.
those
regulations
say,
for
example,
if
you
look
at
the
petition
appendix
under
the
current
regulation,
on
123a,
additional
forage
may
be
apportioned
to
qualified
applicants.
paragraph
(a)
is
essentially
irrelevant.
that's
temporarily
available
livestock
grazing.
(b)
is
additional
forage
available
on
a
sustained
yield
basis.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
with...
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
may
have
had
that
sense,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
fact
that
existing...
people
holding
existing
permits
under
the
priorities
for
apportioning
this,
they
will
first
be...
if
additional
forage
becomes
available,
any
historical
suspended
use
that
was
referred
to
here
will
be
given
to
the
ranchers
who
already
have
suspended
use.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
is...
that
is
essentially
what
it
is,
because
the
current
permits
carry
forward
the
amount
of,
the
number
of
aum's
that
a
person
has
been
able
to
graze
under
a
permit,
and
the
new
permitted
use
regulation
requires
that
the
number
of
aum's
be
specified
in
the
permit.
that
has
not
changed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
unless
they
are
changed,
because
what...
and
this
comes
about
as...
essentially
as
a
matter
of
the
way
the
administrative
process
works.
if
somebody
has
an
existing
permit
for,
let's
say,
100
aum's
on
a
particular
parcel
of
land,
and
it
comes
time
to
renew
the
permit,
and
blm
is
going
to
say
no,
it
should
only
be
80,
well,
the
challenge
will
arise
by
comparing
what
it
used
to
be
with
what
it
now
is,
and
therefore
under
the
apa
essentially
require
the
blm
local
officer
to
explain
why
the
conditions
on
the
range
require
a
lessening
of
the
grazing
that
will
be
allowed,
and
in
fact
the
regulations
at
4116,
the
procedural
regulations,
require
the
regional
official
to
give
a
decision,
to
explain
why
there
will
be
a
reduction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
suspended
use,
suspended
use
could
be
reduced
under
the
land
use
plan,
for
example,
if
there
was...
if
the
land
use
plan
was
revised
during
the
course
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
suspended
use
was
not
reduced.
what
would
happen
is,
active
use
would
be
put
into
a
suspended
category
if
the
range
could
accommodate
less
grazing
than
had
previously
been
true.
now,
the
statute,
if
your
question
is
whether
the
statute
would
have
allowed
the
secretary
to
reduce
suspended
use
the
answer
is,
absolutely.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
regulations
essentially
worked
out
an
accounting
system
to
regulate...
to
ascertain
how
much
grazing
would
be
permitted
year-to-year,
and
over
time,
as
the
amount
of
active
grazing
went
down,
aum's
were
put
into
suspended
use.
but
as
petitioners
have
acknowledged,
it's
not
realistic
to
think
that
those
historical
uses
are
going
to
get
up
to
what
they
had
been,
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
secretary's
new
approach
here
not
to
allow
new
suspended...
the
next
time
there's
a
permanent,
more
or
less
long-term
reduction
to
put
that
into
the
suspended
use
category
is
that
it
doesn't
reflect
reality.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
it's
better
to
have
the
system
reflect
the
present-day
reality
of
what
the
active
grazing...
and
lenders
will
know
what
the
active...
the
permitted
use
under
the
permit
is,
the
rancher
will
know
what
the
permitted
use
under
the
permit
is,
those
involved
in
the
land
use
planning
and
blm
and
the
public
will
know,
not
paper
cows
put
into
a
suspended
use
account,
but
what
is
actually
going
on
on
the
range.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
does.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
you're
right
about
what
they're
saying,
but
they're
wrong,
and
i'd
like
to
respond
in
two
points.
one
is,
they're
wrong
about
the
prior
regime,
and
they're
also
wrong
about
the
change
that
happened.
in
1978,
which
was
the
same
year
that
this
definition
of
grazing
preference
was
put
into
the
regulations,
which
is
the
first
time
preference
was
in
the
regulations
that
had
the
number
of
aum's
in
the
concept
of
preference,
in
that
very
same
year,
the
regulations
implementing
flpma,
which
had
just
been
enacted
and
required
land
use
plans
on
all...
on
all
grazing
lands
as
well
as
other
lands
administered
by
blm,
specifically
provided,
for
example,
that
forage
will
not
even
be
made
available
for
livestock
grazing,
and
when
you
talk
about
forage
becoming
available,
it
means
for
livestock
grazing.
if
there's
additional
forage
it
might
be
for
wildlife.
it
might
be
for
something
else.
those
regulations
in
1978
said
that
they
were
dealing
only
with
the
use
of
forage
that
is
available
after
forage
is
allocated
to
other
uses
under
the
land
use
plan.
they
also
made
clear
that
the
amount
of...
that
the
plan
could
be
amended,
that
the
amount
of
active
use
could
be
reduced.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay.
if
i...
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--okay.
first
of
all,
the...
flpma
requires
that
the
land
use
plans
be
done,
so
if
petitioners
have
a
quarrel
with
that
aspect
of
the
sensible
use
of
the
domain,
that
is
something
that
congress
has
required.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but
the
essential
point
about
the
land
use
planning
under
flpma
is
that
it
is
a
way
of
carrying
out
authority
that
the
secretary
had
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
to
begin
with.
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
not
a
livestock
maximization
statute
itself.
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
passed
at
a
time
when
the
public
domain,
the
public
rangelands
were
in
very
bad
shape
because
of
overgrazing,
because
of
drought,
and
a
principal
purpose
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
itself...
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
grazing
districts
that
are
set
forth
in
section
2
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
on
page
103,
the
maintenance
of
the
livestock
industry
is
not...
i'm
sorry,
on
103a
of
the
petition
appendix...
it
refers
to
such
things
as
to
regulate
the
occupancy
and
use,
to
preserve
the
land
and
its
resources
from
destruction,
and
to
provide
for
orderly
use,
improvement,
and
development
of
the
range.
this
was
a
range
restoration
act
as
well
as
a
regulation
of
grazing
land.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
petitioners
have
said
that
they
understand
that
the
secretary
can
alter
preference
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so
whatever
the
initial
adjudication
was...
and
even
in
the
early
years
it
changed
from
year
to
year,
so
the
initial
preference
rights
that
were
established
are
an
implementation
of
very
broad
language.
the
secretary
didn't
even
have
to
do
that
in
the
way
in
which
he
did.
but
the
more
fundamental
point
is
the
preference,
as
used
in
sentence
3
of
section
3
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
on
page
104a,
it
talks
about
who
among
qualified
applicants
for
grazing
permits
will
be
given
a
preference.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
in
terms
of
whatever
grazing
is
made
available,
how
does
it
get
apportioned
among
people
based...
and
there
were
complicated
questions
of
somebody
who
was
using
the
public
rangeland
before
1934,
and
how
much
grazing
were
they
doing.
it
was
essentially
a
way
to
make
an
equitable
apportion
of
the
land
in
1934.
but
what
this
sentence
does
not
answer
is
how
much
grazing
will
be
made
available
in
the
first
place.
this
only
tells
you
what
to...
how
to
apportion,
and
even
that
is
in
broad
discretion,
but
how
to
apportion
what
grazing
is
made
available,
and
that
is
made
clear
if
you
look
at
the
next
sentence,
which
begins
in
the
middle
of
page
104a.
it
says,
such
permit
shall
be
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
10
years,
subject
to
the
preference
right
of
the
permittees
to
renewal
in
the
discretion
of
the
secretary.
even
the
renewal,
whether
to
renew
a
permit
was
in
the
discretion
of
the
secretary.
if
the
secretary
chose
to
renew
the
permit,
then
the
prior
holder
would
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
it's
a
major
change
for
improvement
in
increased
grazing
or
decreased
grazing,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
yes,
because
the
regulations
do
provide
for
changes
according
to
the
land
use
plan
and,
of
course,
lenders
are
on
notice
of
that.
but
if
i
could
just
respond
to
this
point
about
the
land
use
plans,
the
secretary
determined
and
explained
in
the
rule-making
process
that
it
was
his
judgment
that
the
use
of
land
use
plans
and
other
requirements
of
these
1995
regulations
that
require
changes
to
be
based
on
increased
scientific
knowledge
will,
in
fact,
enhance
the
stability
of
the
livestock
industry
because
people
will
know
what
they
can
depend
upon
in
the
plan,
and
that
there
won't
be
a
change--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
i
do,
because
this
has
to
do
with
the
reduction
of
fees,
not
the
direction
to
reduce
grazing,
and
if
you
look
at
the
preceding
sentence,
i
only
got
to
the
clause
that
talked
about
renewal
of
permits
in
the
discretion
of
the
secretary.
the
latter
part
of
that
sentence
says,
who
shall
specify
from
time
to
time
numbers
of
stock
and
seasons
of
use.
it
says
from
time
to
time,
not
once
and
for
all
time.
the
idea
was
that
this
is
a
dynamic
situation,
and
the
secretary
could
change
the
amount
of
livestock
permitted.
suspended
use
was
an
administrative
measure.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
did.
i
mean,
for
example,
section
7
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
which
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix
but
was
enacted
or
revised
in
1936,
allowed
the
secretary
to
determine
that
lands
that
were
put
in
the
grazing
district
were
in
fact
more
suitable
for
any
other
purpose
besides
grazing,
and
to
remove
them
from
grazing.
if
those
lands
happened
to
be
on
an
allotment
that
an
individual
had
a
permit
for,
the
act
itself
contemplates
that
those
lands
could
be
removed
from
grazing,
and
if
i
could
please
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
point
about
the
adequately
safeguard,
because
that
sentence,
there
are
a
number
of
words
in
that
sentence
that
are
i
think
important
to
focus
on.
the
first
thing
is,
it
does
not
say
grazing
preferences
shall
be
adequately
safeguarded.
it
says,
grazing
privileges
shall
be
adequately
safeguarded.
the
grazing
privilege
is
what
the
permit
gives
you.
it
isn't
some
antecedent
interest.
it's...
the
privilege
to
graze
on
the
public
lands
is
what
the
permit
gives
you,
so
what
this
means
is,
during
the
term
of
the
permit,
the
privilege
that
the
permit
gives
you
will
be
adequately
safeguard.
most
fundamentally
you
have...
and
this
was
the
central
purpose
of
the
taylor
grazing
act.
if
you
get
a
permit,
you
have
a
right
to
graze
there
and
to
exclude
others.
the
privileges
that
you
get
to
graze
on
the
public
domain
are
an
important
right,
and
cattle
ranchers
have
grown
up
on
that,
but
it
is
primarily
a
privilege
to
exclude
others,
and
the
secretary.
the
secretary
can
no
more
oust--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
this
sentence,
by
the
way,
it's
not
clear
that
it
was
intended
to
do
anything
more
than
to
suggest
to
the
secretary
that
in
the
initial
apportionment
of
the
domain
in
1934
the
secretary
should
give
weight
to
what
had
gone
before,
but
to
the
extent
it
has
any
continuing
force
it
has
the
one
i
mentioned.
and
it
also
has
the
effect
that
the
secretary,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
o'connor,
cannot
simply
go
on
the
land
or
revoke
a
permit
without
following
the
process,
so
the
permittee
is
protected...
i
don't
know
that
this
comes
from
the
adequately
safeguard--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
could
be...
there
could
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
it
could
not
be.
there
could
be
specific
stat--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
the
principal
reason
is,
for
example,
the
provision
of
flpma
that
deals
with
permits.
there's
a
whole
section
of
flpma
that
deals
with
grazing
permits,
1752,
and
if
one
looks
at...
if
you
look
at
page
114a
of
the
petition
appendix--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
to
bring
grazing
under
the
multiple
use
requirements
of
flpma,
and
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1978,
right
after
flpma,
the
same
set
of
regulations
that
petitioners
wish
we
would
go
back
to,
made
clear
the
secretary's
understanding
that
flpma
required
grazing
to
be
regulated.
and
if
you
look
on
subsection
(c)
on
page
114a,
where
it
talks
about
first
priority
for
the
renewal
of
an
existing
permit,
so
it
is
talking
about
grazing
that
is
already
occurring,
it
says,
so
long
as
the
lands
for
which
the
permit
is
issued
remain
available
for
domestic
livestock
grazing
in
accordance
with
land
use
plans
prepared
pursuant
to
section
1712.
so
it's
clear
that...
if
it
wasn't
clear
before
that
the
taylor
grazing
act
wasn't
just
a
grazing
statute
but
also
a
multiple
use
statute,
these
provisions
of
flpma
make
clear,
and
in
fact
this
section
also
makes
clear
that
there
is
certainly
no
statutory
right
to
a
permanent
entitlement
to
the
amount
of
grazing
that
may
have
been
adjudicated
many
years
ago
when
the
range
was
originally
being
apportioned
under
very
different
circumstances.
because
it
says
even
the
right
of
renewal
of
a
permit,
something
that
a
person
has
a
preference
to,
is
present
after
flpma
only
if
the
secretary
chooses
to
make
the
lands
available
for
grazing,
the
permittee
is
in
compliance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
and
terms
and
conditions,
and
he
accepts
the
new
terms
and
conditions
of
the
new
permit,
thereby
once
again
making
clear
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
the
authority
to
prescribe
the
terms
an/d
conditions
for
grazing
on
the
public
lands.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
as
we...
the
land
use
plan
requirement
came
into
effect
in
1978,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
all
grazing
covered
by
the
taylor
grazing
act
is
now
covered
by
land
use
plans,
either
prior,
what
were
called
framework
plans,
or
the
new
resource
management
plans,
and
petitioners
have
still
not
shown
anything
to
this
court
that
suggests
that
that
land
use
management
process,
which
was
designed
to
instill
stability
in
the
areas
covered
by
those
plans,
has
failed
to
take
into
account
existing
grazing.
and
as
we
also
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
taylor
grazing
act...
excuse
me,
flpma
and
implementing
regulations
refer
to
existing
uses
of
the
range,
the
dependence
of
local
properties
and
private
property
and
local
communities
on
the
range,
so
the
land
use
planning
process,
which
also
has
broad
public
participation
and
allows
for
grazing
permittees
to
participate
in
the
planning
process
and
to
appeal,
affords
ranchers,
as
others
who
have
a
stake
in
the
use
of
the
public
domain,
it
assures
them
protection
for
their
interests.
if
i
could
also
point
out
that
in
the
rule-making,
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
i
realize
it
hasn't
been
challenge
on
a
failure
to
articulate,
but
pages
9921
to
9923
of
60
federal
register
and
the
proposed
notice
at
59
federal
register
at
9928
explain
the
secretary's
reasons
for
what
he
explained
was
essentially
a
change
in
terminology
between
the
permitted...
the
new
definition
of
permitted
use,
which
corresponds
to
sentence
4
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
dealing
with
the
numbers
of
livestock
from
time
to
time,
separating
that
from
preference,
which
is
governed
by
sentence
3
of
section
3
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
which
talks
about
who
among
potential
grazers
would
have
a
priority.
that
doesn't
give
grazers,
either
individually
or
as
a
class,
a
preference
over
nongrazing
use
of
the
forage
and,
as
i
say,
increases
and
decreases
in
new
forage
that
becomes
available
for
grazing
are
handled
in
essentially
the
same
way.
essentially
the
same
priorities--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
current...
i'm
sorry,
the...
was
there
anything
in
the
current
regulations
that
ties
it
to
preference?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
permitted
use,
the
regulations
provide
that
permitted
use
must
be
stated
and
the
number
of
aum's
must
be
stated
in
the
permit,
and
it's
attached
to
the
base
property,
just
as
in
the
prior
situation
preference
and
the
aum's
as
they
were
stated
under
preference
were
attached
to
the
base
property.
the...
your
reference
to
sentence
3
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
as
may
be
necessary,
again
was
a
way
of
apportioning
up
the
land
at
the
time
the
act
went
into
effect,
but
it's
important
to
notice
that
the
renewal
permit
provision
of
flpma
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
not
an
ongoing
entitlement
to
a
certain
amount
of
public
rangeland
in
order
to
satisfy
whatever
the
base
properties
ranching
requirements
are,
because
all
there
is
is
a
preference
to
renewal
of
the
permit
for
a
particular
allotment,
but
the
land
use
planning
process
or
other
ecological
determinations
may
conclude
that
that
particular
allotment
can
only
sustain
50
percent
of
the
grazing
that
it
previously
allowed.
that
may
be
less
public
land
than
would
be
necessary
to
sustain
the
full
ranch
on
the
base
property,
but
nothing
in
the
taylor
grazing
act,
and
certainly
nothing
after
flpma,
would
allow
a
rancher
to
say,
i
have
a
right
to
oust
other
uses
of
the
land,
or
a
right
to
allow
grazing
in
a
way
that
might
damage
the
land
in
order
to
be
able
to
support
my
base
property.
again,
this
is
just
an
apportionment
among
ranchers
to
the
extent
the
secretary
allows
grazing
to
occur
on
the
public
domain.
with
respect
to
the
adequately
safeguarded,
i
wanted
to
make
two
other
points
about
that.
it
says
to
the
extent
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act,
which
as
i
mentioned
elsewhere
talk
about
orderly
use
and
prevent
destruction
of
range
resources,
so
that
is
an
important
limitation.
it
also
says,
grazing
privileges
recognized
and
acknowledged.
whatever
grazing
privileges
a
rancher
gets
under
a
permit
are
automatically
conditioned
by
the
provisions
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
itself
and
regulations
that
allow
the
secretary
to
reduce
grazing
to
modify
the
use
of
the
land
and
to
protect
the
environment.
there
have
not
been
any
questions
about
the
other
two
regulations
that
are
at
issue
here.
on
the
range
improvements,
we
think
that
there
the
secretary
is
just
exercising
the
authority
that
any
landlord
or
any
landowner
would
have
to
work
out
by
agreement
in
advance
what
would
be
the
disposition
of
improvements
that
are
added
to
the
land.
that
simplifies
it.
there
is
no
reason
to
refer
to
arcane
rules
of
fixtures
under
property
law.
the
secretary
has
simply
specified
in
advance
what
the
ownership
of
improvements
will
be,
which
greatly
simplifies
the
administration
of
what
are
after
all
public
lands,
so
that
there
will
not
be
private
stakeholdings,
private
fixtures
on
public
lands,
and
after
all,
if
they
were
fixtures,
the
only
right
would
be
to
remove
them
and
you
certainly
couldn't
remove
a
well,
probably,
that
had
been
constructed
by
a
prior
owner.
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
renew
fences.
so
what
has
happened
is,
there's
provisions
for
compensation
rather
than
the
removal
of
the
fixtures.
