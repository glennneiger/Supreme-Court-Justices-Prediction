and
it
affects
you
adversely
automatically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understand
that,
they
couldn't
do
that
under
the
present
regulation,
either,
because
they
do
say
they
protect
their
priority
over
other
rival
applicants,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
we
know
that
under
the
new
regulation
that
the
secretary
would
not
be
able
to
do
precisely
the
same
thing
and
say,
i've
got
five
people
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
a
sixth
coming
in,
and
given
the
history,
i'm
not
going
to
let
the
sixth
one
in?
