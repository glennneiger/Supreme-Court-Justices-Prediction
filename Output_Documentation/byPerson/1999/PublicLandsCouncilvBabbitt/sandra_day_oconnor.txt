but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--counsel,
i
never
saw
the
word
adjudicated
forage
used
in
any
regulation.
it
seems
to
be
a
term
that
you
constantly
use,
but
tell
me
what
regulation
refers
to
adjudicated
forage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
section
are
you
reading
from?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
section
are
you
reading
from?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you've
left
that
other
one
out
altogether.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
a
sense
that's
true
already.
the
secretary
has
felt
free
to
lower
the
number
of
cattle,
for
instance,
to
be
grazed
on
a
particular
piece
of
land
for
some
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
it
improved,
do
you...
is
it
true
that
even
under
the
old
system
the
secretary
perhaps
wouldn't
have
to
go
up
to
the
full
original
adjudicated
use.
the
secretary
could
say,
yes,
things
are
better,
and
we're
going
to
increase
the
active
use
by
so
many
head?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
i
can
picture
lots
of
as-applied
challenges
under
this
new
scheme,
but
what
we're
struggling
with
is
how
to
deal
with
it
on
the
facial
basis
and
without
regard
to
consideration
of
whether
it
was
just
arbitrary
under
an
administrative
analysis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
not
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
they're
not
challenging--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
former
adjudicated
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
insist
that
henceforth
the
permits
that
are
given
will
still
reflect
the
original
adjudicated
[=
aum's]?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
you
can
understand
how
that
explanation
causes
concern,
because
the
taylor
grazing
act
did
contemplate
that
the
original
adjudication
would
allocate
grazing
permits
based
on
the
land
base
and
the
water
rights
of
the
applicants
for
grazing,
and
that
that
would
be
adequately
safeguarded,
that
privilege
would
be
adequately
safeguarded.
now
we
come
along
with
land
use
plans
for
multiple
purposes,
and
there
is
nothing
in
that
to
indicate
that
the
grazing
preferences
will
be
adequately
safeguarded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
they
can
be
just,
you
know,
off
for
other
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does,
but
it
also
contained
a
clause
that
indicated
that
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
not
to
be
superseded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
section
3
did
say
preference
shall
be
given
in
the
issuance
of
grazing
permits
to
those
who
are
landowners
engaged
in
the
livestock
business,
necessary
to
permit
the
proper
use
of
lands,
water
rights
owned--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--occupied
and
used
by
them,
and
that
that
will
be
adequately
safeguarded.
now,
that's
the
heart
of
their
claim,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
subsequent
federal
land
policy
and
management
act,
in
its
contemplation
and
requirement
of
land
use
plans,
may
not
be
in
accord
with
that
taylor
grazing
act
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
also
are
limitations
on
the
denial
of
renewal
of
a
permit--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
a
permittee
who's
obeying
the
rules
of
the
secretary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
explain
to
me
what
section
302
of
the
federal
land
policy
and
management
act
means
when
it
says
the
secretary
shall
manage
the
public
lands
under
principles
of
multiple
use
and
sustained
yield
in
accordance
with
the
land
use
plans,
except
that
where
a
tract
of
such
public
land
has
been
dedicated
to
specific
uses,
according
to
any
other
provisions
of
law,
it
will
be
managed
in
accordance
with
such
law?
what
are
those
dedications
to
other
specific
uses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
that
be
for
grazing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
that...
is
grazing
a
specific
use
in
another
law,
specifically
taylor
grazing
act?
i
didn't
understand
how
to
interpret
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
the
new
regulations,
though,
that
links
permitted
use
by
grazers
to
either
the
grazing
preference
or
any
other
measure
of
numbers
needed
by
the
permit-holders
to
support
an
economically
viable
grazing
unit
in
combination
with
their
own
base
properties
and
water,
which
is
what
the
taylor
grazing
act
contemplated?
