mr.
bishop,
i
think
it's
not
chevron
that
justice
breyer
is
raising.
it's
the
state
farm
question--
--right.
--which
you
don't
raise
until
you
get
to
this
court.
i
don't
know...
you
didn't
make
this
a
state
farm
case
at
all
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
argue
that
this
state...
that
state
farm
controls
that
the
secretary
didn't
give
an
adequate
explanation
of
changing
from
one
system
to
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
very
puzzled
by
your,
congress
didn't
enact
specifically,
when
you
are
faced
with
something
that...
with
the
bill,
the
grazing
rights
bill
that
would
have
said
specifically,
these
are
rights
that
you
preserve,
but
congress
didn't
enact
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
what
congress
didn't
do
in
1946
and
1953
is
much
more
relevant
than
what
you're
urging
about
a
tack-on
to
an
appropriations
bill.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
amounts
you
conceded
the
actual
amounts
you
can
use
the
secretary
not
only
can
but
must...
doesn't
it
have
the
secretary
must
adjust--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--based
on
other
conditions
of
the
land?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
often
is
that
reality,
that
the
active
use
gets
boosted
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
conceded
that,
as
far
as
the
active
use
is
concerned,
there's
no
different
situation
today
than
there
was
under
the
prior
regulations
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you...
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the...
that
what
you're
complaining
about
is
the
absence
of
this
suspended
use,
but
you're
not
complaining
about
what
the
secretary
did
as
far
as
active
use
is
concerned?
