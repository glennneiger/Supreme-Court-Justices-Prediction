mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
preference
amount
of
forage
adjudicated
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
as
necessary
to
the
proper
use
of
a
permittee's
base
property
must
be
adequately
safeguarded
by
the
secretary.
that's
our
contention.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
if,
in
all
applications,
the
regulation
is
unlawful
because
it
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute,
then
it
is
facially
invalid,
and
our
position
is--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
it
affects
you
adversely
automatically,
that's
right.
our
position
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
protection,
the
adequate
safeguarding
of
adjudicated
forage,
and
that
by
eliminating
adjudicated
forage
from
the
regulations
it's
no
longer
possible
for
the
secretary
to
safeguard
it.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute.
let
me
start
with
the
statute.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute
in
terms,
but
the
concept
is
clearly
in
the
taylor
grazing
act.
congress
recognized
that
in
designating
grazing
districts
they
would
be
oversubscribed.
it
contemplated
a
process
in
which
the
secretary
would
determine
who
would
be
able
to
graze
in
those
districts,
and
it
set
out
some
parameters,
and
the
most
important
one,
in
section
3
of
the
grazing
act,
says
preference
shall
be
given
in
the
issuance
of
grazing
permits
to
persons
who
have
base
property--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--here's
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
your
honor,
on
page
103
to
104a.
the
language
i'm
reading
from
is
104...
is--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--preference
shall
be
given
in
the
issuance
of
grazing
permits
to
people
with
base
property
as
may
be
necessary
to
permit
the
proper
use
of
that
base
property.
there
is
no
plausible
way
to
read
the
as
necessary
clause
except
as
a
reference
to
an
amount
of
forage,
and
the
way
that
this
worked
was
that
the
base
ranch
could
support
a
certain
number
of
livestock
for
part
of
the
year.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
to
enable
that
property
to
be
used,
it
was
necessary
for
the
rancher
to
have
access
to
enough
forage
on
the
range
to
support
the
livestock
for
the
rest
of
the
year--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--so
our
position
is
that
the...
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
oh,
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we
do
assert
rights
to
the
adjudicated
amount,
preference
amount
of
forage.
now,
our
argument
is
not
about
freezing
actual
grazing
use
at
the
levels
that
the
secretary
adjudicated
after
1934,
but
there
are
things
that
the
preference
amount
does
for
us,
and
just
let
me
mention
those.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the...
first
of
all,
the
preference
amount
staked
the
permittee's
claim
to
more
forage
if
it
became
available.
now,
we
have
no
dispute
that
the
active
use
can
be
reduced
below
the
preference
amount.
in
fact,
when
the
preference
was
first
adjudicated
the
active
use
was
often
below
the
preference
amount,
right
from
the
beginning.
we
have
no
dispute
that
the
preference
itself
can
be
readjudicated,
and
we
have
no
dispute
that
the
grazing
district
can
be
readjudicated
and
the
use
given
over
to
something
else,
but
as
long
as
the
land
is
designated
as
a
grazing
district,
then
my
preference
gives
me
a
claim
to
more
forage
if
it
becomes
available,
so
under
the
range
code
4110.3-1,
for
example,
which
is
at
page
9a
to
10a
of
the
addendum
to
the
blue
brief,
permanent--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--9a
to
10a
of
the
blue
brief.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
and
this
is
reflected
in
earlier
versions
of
the
range
code
as
well
in
different
forms,
but
permanent
increases
in
forage
were
first
allocated
to
existing
permittees
up
to
the
preference
amount,
and
if
you
look
back
to
the
1942
code,
the
language
is
that
increases
in
carrying
capacity
will
be
participated
in
by
existing
permittees
to
the
extent
of
their
respective
qualifications,
but
that
idea
has
always
been
in
there.
second,
and
these
are
all
connected,
the
preference
amount--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--additional...
the
additional--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--this
is
410.3-1(b),
additional
forage
available
on
a
sustained
yield
basis
shall
be
first
apportioned
in
satisfaction
of
grazing
preferences.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
it's
a
facial
challenge,
your
honor.
you're
right
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
have
in
this
record
a
history
of
the
application
of
the
1995
regulations
and,
in
fact,
while
the
litigation
has
been
pending,
and
particularly
because
we
won
in
the
district
court,
the
agency
really
hasn't
been
doing
anything
under
the
1995
regulations.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
everyone
is
worse
off.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
everyone
is
worse
off
because
prior
to
1995
we
had
a...
we
had,
in
our
permits...
the
preference
amount
was
listed
in
the
permit.
every
single
permit
issued
from
1934
until
1995
listed
the
adjudicated
amount
of
forage,
labeled--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
we
can
say
that
we
have
no...
we
will
have
no
entitlement
to
having
our--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
we
can't
say
that--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
that's
not
the
nature
of
our
challenge.
the
nature
of
our
challenge
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
regulation.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
we...
well,
we
are--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--yes.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
lenders--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
lenders
have
taken
into
account
the
preference
amount
of
forage,
and
they've
taken--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that's
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
justice
breyer,
i
hope
we
haven't
waived
the
administrative
law
claim.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
by
the
end
of
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--this
is
a--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--this
is
a
chevron
stage
1
challenge,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
we
do
cite
chevron
in
the
brief.
it's
a
chevron
stage
1
analysis.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
we
have
always
argued,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
secretary
lacks
the
authority
under
plain
statutory
language,
and
also
because
there
has
been
a
consistent
administrative
interpretation
for
60
years,
and
because--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we
did
argue
that
below.
in
our
brief
in
this
case,
we
decided
that
the
argument
to
press
is
the,
what
we
believe
is
the
strongest
argument,
that
there
is
no
conceivable
basis
in
the
statute--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we...
well,
we
have
cite...
in
what
i
would
hope
would
preserve
that
issue,
if
someone
is
inclined
to
go
that
way,
is
that
at
the
end
of
our
brief
we
did
say
that
on
the
chevron
stage
2
we
don't
think
that
there's
an
adequate
justification.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
what
we
have...
i
mean,
the...
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute
requires
this,
the
secretary's
been
doing
it
for
a
long
time,
that
congress
revisited
this
area
without
changing
the
secretary's
regulations,
that
congress
in
1993
specifically
refused
to
enact
these
regulations
when
the
affirmative
defense
asked
them
to,
and
that
there
has
been
no...
and
certainly
there
has
been
no
explanation
of...
as
to
why
the
secretary--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--has
changed
his
mind
after
all
of
that.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
now,
congress
didn't
need
to
do
that,
because
it
had
already
provided
in
the
taylor
grazing
act
that
adjudicated
privileges
that
grazing
privileges,
including
this
adjudicated
amount
of
forage,
should
be
adequately
safeguarded,
and
congress
was
concerned
that
that
not
ripen
into
a
right
to
the
land,
which
is
why
the
no
right,
title,
or
interest
that
the
court
addressed
in
fuller
is
in
there.
but
congress
did,
in
saying
that
necessary,
adjudicated
necessary
amounts
of
forage
should
be
adequately
safeguard,
adequately
safeguarded,
intend
that
the
secretary
continue
to
recognize
and
provide
protection
for
those
forage
amounts.
so--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
secretary
must
adjust--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
secretary
must
adjust
that,
and
if
i
can
just
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
initial
question,
i'd
just
like
to
finish
my
list
of
what
it
is
that
we
think
we
do
get
from
the
preference.
i
mean,
first
of
all
we
get
the
claim
to
additional
permanent
forage
when
it
becomes
available.
the
preference
amount
has
always
been
the
baseline
for
measuring
suspended
use,
and
the
permit,
every
permit
preference,
a
line
for
preference,
a
line
for
suspended
use,
a
line
for
active
use.
the
suspended
amount
is
listed,
and
that's
the
difference
between
active
use
and
the
preference
amount,
and
it
becomes
available
under
the
regulations
to
the
permittee--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--if
the
forage
is
increased.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the...
these
are...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--i
think
that
those
are
ways
in
which
the
secretary
has
adequately
safeguarded
the
preference
in
the
past.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
all
of
those
in
their
detailed
ways
as
set
out
in
the
regulations
necessary...
necessarily
have
to
continue.
i
think
that
adequately
safeguarded
doesn't
have
a
determinate
meaning,
but
it
clearly
does
mean
that
the
secretary
must
continue
to
recognize
and
deal
with
the
preference,
so
if
i
can
give
one
other
example,
the
preference
amount
establishes
claims
relative
to
the
claims
to
forage
of
a
permittee's
neighbors
on
the
allotment
and
to
new
applicants,
so
it
prevents
the
blm
from
shifting
aum's
at
will
among
permittees
and
applicants.
in
the
mcneil
v.
seaton
case,
which
we
cited
in
our
briefs
as
an
example
of
that,
where
the
secretary
tried
to
give
forage
to
a
new
applicant
when
there
were
people
with
adjudicated
privileges
already
on
the
range
who
weren't
raising
up
to
the
preference
amount,
and
the
court
said
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--you're
right,
but...
you're
right
in
part,
justice
stevens.
you're
right
that
once
the
permitted
use
is
established,
that
there
are
restrictions
on
how
it
can
be
changed.
you
are
wrong
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
correlation
between
permitted
use,
which
refers
only
to
the
land
use
plan,
forage
as
permitted
by
the
land
use
plan,
and
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
adjudicated
preference
amounts
that
were
previously
determined
by
the
secretary.
a
land
use
plan,
which
is
a...
permitted
use
now
is
the
land
use
allocated
by
the
secretary
under
a
land
use
plan.
a
land
use
plan
operates
at
a
high
level
of
generality.
it
does
not
allocate
forage
to
specific
permittees,
any
more
than
the
forest
service
land
use
plan
that
was
considered
in
ohio
forestry
association
permitted
the
cutting
down
of
trees.
it's
the
blm,
operating
under
the
grazing
regulations,
that
actually
allocates
forage
to
individual
permittees,
and
it's
left
a
lot
of
leeway
by
the
land
use
plan.
under
the
current
rules,
the
permitted
use
rule
will
allow
the
secretary
to
set
the
permitted
use
essentially
in
his
discretion,
without
constraints.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
are
you
talking
about
active,
active
use,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
through
active
use,
that
is
true,
and
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
the
land
use
plans
clearly
require
that
the...
that
on
an
individualized
basis,
in
a
site...
using
a
site-specific
analysis,
that
active
use
be
varied
according
to
the
conditions.
our
claim
is
that
the
preference
itself,
the
preference
amount
that
the
secretary
has
recognized
for
60
years,
which
is
always
higher
than
the
active
use,
and
which
gives
us
certain
claims,
has
to
be
recognized.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
mcneil
is
an
example.
a
new
applicant
comes
in--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
says,
i
want
to...
i've
got
a
ranching
operation.
i'm
just
setting
one
up,
bought
some
land,
setting
up
a
ranching
operation.
i
want
to
get
forage
on
the
range
here.
that
range
is
already
fully
allocated
by
adjudication.
the
preference
amounts
are
established.
no
one
is
grazing
up
to
their
preference
amount.
everyone's
active
use
is
below
the
preference
amount.
the
requirements
that
the
preference
amounts
establish
a
first
choice,
if
you
like,
to
obtain
available
forage
on
the
range
means
that
you
can't
keep
inviting
people
in
to
reduce
my
active
use
to
give
it
to
somebody
else.
you
can't
give
it
to
my
neighbor.
you
can't
give
it
to
a
new
applicant.
if
there
is
a
suspended...
suspended
use
is
another
example.
suspended
use,
the
difference
between
the
preference
amount
and
active
use.
the
suspended
use
is
available,
held
available
for
the
permittee
to
use
if
conditions
improve
on
the
range
and
there
is
more
forage.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
you
know,
i
don't
have
percentage
figures,
and
i
don't
think
we
or
the
government
have
any,
but
range
improvements,
for
example,
if
you
read
the
pria,
the
public
rangelands
improvement
act,
a
lot
of
the
legislative
history
there
in
the
introductory
purposes
of
the
act
explained
how
range
improvements,
water
improvements
can
open
up
new
parts
of
the
range
that
weren't
previously
available
for
grazing
because
the
livestock
had
no
water
there,
or
they
can...
and
in
addition
seeding,
chaining,
things
that
can
be
done
to
the
land
to
improve
its
condition,
those
sorts
of
improvements--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
there's
no...
no
one
realistically
thinks
that
the
preference
amounts
will
ever
be
maintained
over
a
long
period
of
time.
in
fact,
the
preferences
were
readjudicated
in
the
1950's
and
sixties
to--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
i
mean,
my
argument
is
this,
that
the
statute,
and
a
look
at
the
history
since
the
statute
was
passed,
mandates
that
preference
amounts
of
forage
be
adequately
safeguarded.
the
word
adequately
safeguarded
ceases
to
mean
anything
at
all
if
the
preference
amounts
are
abolished,
and
that
is
what
the
1995
rules
do.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i'm
sorry.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
suspended
use.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the
preference
has
to
be
adequately
safeguarded.
up
to
this
point,
the
secretary
has
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
you
have
to
take
account
of
that
preference
and
on
a
site-specific
basis
there
may
be
a
particular
reason,
on
a
site-specific,
individualized
basis,
to
think
that
you
shouldn't
get
the
increased
preference
amount.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
and--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--you--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--you
have
a...
an
absolute
right
to
exclude
a
new
grazer.
you
may
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
get
all
of
that--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that
forage.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that
100
percent.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
he
can't
give
it
to
someone
else
while...
now,
he
can't
give
it
to
someone
else
without
doing
certain
other
things.
there
are
other
things
that
could
be
done.
always
on
an
individualized
basis
the
secretary
can
reduce
the...
can
reduce
the
preference--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--can
reduce
active
use,
can
even
take
the
land
out
of
the
grazing
district
altogether.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
adjudicated
preference
amount
of
forage
any
more.
if
i
can
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i
just
don't
see
the
broad
discretion
in
the
tga
that
mr.
kneedler
does.
preference
was
adjudicated
according
to
what
was
necessary
for
the
proper
use
of
the
base
property
and
the
statute
says
that
the
privileges,
including
that
adjudicated
amount
of
forage,
have
to
be
adequately
safeguarded.
the
reason
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge
is
that
the
1995
regulations
define
permitted
use
by
reference
to
a
land
use
plan,
and
without
any
reference
whatsoever
to
the
preference
amount
adjudicated
as
necessary.
the
needs
of
the
base
property
have
entirely
disappeared.
the
secretary
can
set
the
permitted
use
without
any
reference
to
those
needs.
land--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
i
don't
really
concede
that.
it
may
be
that
we
have
the
same
active
use
today
as
tomorrow,
the
day
before,
and
the
day
after
the
regulations.
what
we
don't
have
is
that
if
the
next
day
there
is
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
forage
available
on
the
range,
we
have
no
claim
whatsoever
to
that,
based
on
the
preference.
the
permitted
use
now
controls,
and
because
the
land
use
plan--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that's
right.
i
mean,
active
use
is
varied
according
to
the
condition
of
the
range.
what
we
are
complaining
about
is
the
loss
of
a
claim
to
more
active
use,
based
on
our
preference,
and
it's
not
the
land
use
plan.
the
land
use
plan
referred
to
in
the
permit...
mr.
kneedler
suggests
that
that
has
changed
everything.
land
use
planning
for
sustained
yield
and
multiple
use
started
in
1964,
and
for
years
land
use
planning
and
the
preference
amount
continued
side-by-side.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
because
the
change
isn't
taking
place
at
the
land
use
planning
level.
land
use
planning
occurs
at
a
general
level.
it
does
not
allocate
the
privileges
to
individuals
on
the
allotment.
it's
the
grazing
preference...
it's
the
grazing
regulations
that
do
that.
it
used
to
be
that
the
grazing
regulations
had
a
substantive
basis
to
them.
the
amount
of
forage
necessary
to
the
proper
use
of
the
land
as
adjudicated.
that's
gone.
there
is
no
standard
now
in
the
regulations
required
by
the
tga,
and
there
is
no
standard
in
the
land
use
plan.
there
are
no
standards
at
all.
there
are
no
claims
that
we
have
to
additional
forage
based
on
the
needs
of
our
property.
and
for
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
we'll
be
okay,
that
our
suspended
use
will
be
recognized,
is
frankly
ridiculous,
because
in
the
explanation
of
the
finer
rules
he
says
that
the
secretary
will
not
allow
permittees
to
continue
to
carry
suspended
use
because
that
suggests
that
they'll
be
able
to
get
that
suspended
use
back
as
active
use.
that
is
exactly
what
the
adequately
safeguard
language
of
the
tga
requires,
and
what
we
have
now
been
deprived
of.
it's
also
anachronistic
to
have
the
secretary
suggest
that
the
tga
was
a
multiple
use
statute.
it
was
not
a
multiple
use
statute.
it
was
all
about
grazing.
it
was
passed
at
the
behest
of
the
livestock
industry
because
they
were
in
such
deep
trouble,
and
each
of
the
purposes
stated
in
the
statute
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
range
is
intended
to
improve
the
financial
condition
of
the
livestock
industry
in
the
long
term,
and
all
of
that
has
now
been
lost.
all
of
our
protections,
all
of
our
safeguards
reflected
in
the
regulations
prior
to
1995
have
now
completely
disappeared,
and
it's
not
the
land
use
plan
that's
responsible
for
that.
it's
a
permitted
use
definition
that
now
writes
adjudicated
forage
completely
out
of
existence.
thank
you.
