justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you're
saying,
well,
we
had
claims
to
these
things,
and
you...
i
accept
that.
you
did
have
a
claim,
and
you
had
a
procedure
to
try
to
perfect
that
claim,
but
there
is
no
member
of
your
association
that
i
understand,
as
i
understand
it,
who
at
this
time
can
say,
i
had
a
ripe
claim
that
was
cut
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
were
a
lot
worse
off
if
you
can't
get
lending.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
a
whole
brief
here
saying,
there
used
to
be
a
system,
and
the
system
was,
you
have
1,000
grazing
acres,
and
what
you
do
is,
you
give
you
500
cows,
him
300
cows,
her
200
cows,
and
that's
it,
500,
300,
200.
now,
we
have
every
right
in
the
world
to
cut
it
to
500,
but
if
we
do,
it's
you
250,
you
150,
you
100,
so
you
keep
the
same
proportion.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
used
to
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
they've
changed
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
am
i
right
as
to
how
i
described
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
you're
saying
that
the
change
from
the
new
to
the
old
one
means
lenders
won't
lend
you
as
much
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
my
next
question
is
this,
and
i
have
three
here
that
were
related.
i've
gotten
two
out.
the
third
one
is,
i
would
have
thought
you
might
have
a
great
claim
on
the
ground
that
an
agency
has
to
stick
to
the
system
that
it
has
unless
it
explains
why
it's
changed,
all
right,
and
i
looked
for
the
explanation...
a
little
hard
for
me
to
find
it...
but
i
take
it
you
have
not
made
that
claim
in
this
court.
rather,
you
are
arguing
that
the
statute
forbids
them
to
do
it,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
you've
waived
your
administrative
law
claim,
you
haven't
raised
it,
and
the
statutory
claim
i
cannot
imagine
why
if,
on
day
1,
they
had
adopted
their
new
system,
the
statute
would
say
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
anywhere...
you're
talking...
i
looked
at
the
question
presented,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
exceeded
his
authority
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
the
federal
land
policy
and
management
act,
and
the
public
rangelands
improvement
act--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--when
he
promulgated
the
'94
regulations.
that
sounds
to
me
like
the
issue
you
raise...
and
that's
the
one
you
state.
you
talk
about
it
being
on
its
face,
et
cetera...
is,
the
statute
prohibits
the
secretary
from
issuing
regulation
set
2,
and
on
that
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
puzzled.
on
the
first
one...
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
chevron...
i
didn't
see
the
relevant
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
what
chevron
stage
2
has
to
do
with
it.
i
see
what
state
farm
has
to
do
with
it.
that's
the
agency
has
to
provide
a
good
reason
for
changing
its
mind
in
an
important
matter,
but
i
don't
see
what
chevron
stage
2
has
to
do
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
they
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
though
his
challenge
was
very,
very
specific.
i
thought,
as
i
understood
it,
that
there
was
an
old
system,
and
the
old
system
said
if
there
are
three
ranchers
and
1,000
acres,
the
division
500,
300,
200
means
the
following.
you
cut
it
back
to
500
acres,
okay.
we
divide
it
250,
150,
100.
that's
definite.
you
increase
it
by
50
acres.
those
new
50
acres
have
to
be
apportioned
in
precisely
the
same
proportion,
and
if
a
third
or
fourth
rancher
comes
in,
he
must
get
zero,
must
in
all
circumstances,
and
if
one
of
those
existing
ranchers
tries
to
take
1
acre
more
than
his
proportionate
share,
he
cannot
get
it,
in
no
circumstance.
that's
the
old
system,
and
on
that
system
they
can
get
financing.
then
there
is
a
new
system
which
more
or
less
agrees
you
have
total
right
to
control
the
amount
of
grazing,
but
as
to
apportionment
and
new
ranchers,
it's
up
for
grabs,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
they're
challenging.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
he
doesn't
say
it
doesn't
provide
for
an
apportionment.
what
he
says
is,
it
isn't
clear
that
the
fourth
rancher
who
comes
in
gets
zero--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
isn't
clear
that
the
old
apportionment...
the
new
apportionment
is
done
in
precisely
the
same
proportions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
that's
their
objection.
i
think
that's
their
objection,
and
they
say
that
the...
and
when
i
read
the
comments
in
the,
you
know,
the
rule-making,
they
raised
the
objection
and
they
said
that
the
change
is
going
to
be
that
this
suspended
use
will
disappear
and
instead
their
potential
future
right,
which
may
never
come
about,
will
depend
on
the
land
use
plan,
and
the
response
to
that
i
think
was,
the
land
use
plan
allows
adjustment
of
the
aum
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
i
took
it
as
saying
they're
right
about
that
change.
and
then
you
said...
or
you
didn't,
but
the
interior
department,
where
changes
in
the
situation
are
major,
it
may
be
necessary
to
amend
the
land
use
plan,
thus
reinitiating
the
process,
and
i
wasn't
quite
sure
what
that
meant,
but
what
they
say,
the
problem
is
that
the
financiers
aren't
quite
sure
either--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
therefore
they
won't
give
us...
you
may
say
this
is
all
going
to
work
out
fine,
but
we
go
to
the
bank,
and
we
discover
that
we
can't
borrow
the
money,
and
the
reason
we
can't
borrow
the
money
is
that
whereas
previously
we
had
certainty
about
what
would
happen
to
me
if,
suddenly,
for
some
reason
the
amount
that
was
going
to
be
foraged
went
up,
there's
no
longer
that
certainty.
it
depends
upon
some
future
land
use
plan,
and
some
future
testimony,
and
we
can't
get
a
hold
of
it.
now,
what's...
am
i
right
about
what
they're
saying?
if
i
am,
is
that
what
is
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
response
is
that
they
should
go
talk
to
their
banks
and
they
should
say,
look,
these
paper
cows
never
meant
that
much.
i
mean,
after
all,
they
could
have
changed
the
forage,
they
could
have
brought
in
new
people,
cut
the...
they
could
have
done
all
kinds
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
today
they
promised
in
this
commentary
that
if
there's
a
major
change
in
reality
they're
going
to
try
to
do
something
about
it.
i
mean,
so
they've
said
it
isn't
going
to
make
that
much
change
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
am
i
right
in
thinking
about
how
to
look
at
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
say
in
their...
they
concede
that
this
land
use
plan
in
principle
might
interfere
sometimes
with
your
suspended
paper
rights,
but
then
they
say,
where
it's
major
you're
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
redo
the
whole
plan.
they
obviously
foresee
it
won't
happen
very
often,
if
at
all,
so
why
isn't
it
satisfactory
to
you
that
if
there's
some
big
major
change
in
some
particular
land
use
plan,
which
they
don't
foresee,
you
challenge
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
much
of
the
land
on
the
western
plains
is
public
land.
ranchers
have
long
used
that
land
for
grazing
cattle
and
sheep
and
during
the
early
20th
centuries,
growing
herds
of
livestock
and
increasing
number
of
settlers
led
to
conflict
and
the
famous
conflict
between
the
sheepmen
and
the
cowmen
and
between
all
the
ranchers
and
settlers
and
among
various
other
groups
those
who
fenced
it
in
and
those
who
did
not.
that
conflict,
and
overgrazing,
scarce
water,
and
famous
dust
storms
led
congress
in
1934
to
pass
the
taylor
grazing
act.
that
law
helped
to
preserve
the
public
grazing
lands
by
delegating
considerable
administrative
power
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
regularizing
grazing
practices
to
the
secretary's
grant
of
grazing
permits
for
grazing
livestock
on
the
public
lands.
now
the
case
before
us
involves
some
amendments
that
the
secretary
made
to
the
taylor
act
regulations
in
1995.
groups
primarily
of
ranchers
or
representing
ranchers
have
challenged
the
lawfulness
of
three
of
those
amendments,
claiming
that
they
exceed
the
secretary's
statutory
authority.
one
regulation
changes
the
definition
of
grazing
privileges,
a
second
regulation
deletes
an
earlier
regulation’s
requirement
that
applicants
had
to
be
engaged
in
the
livestock
business,
and
the
third
one
puts
title
to
permanent
range
improvement
such
as
fences
and
wells
in
the
united
states.
the
tenth
circuit
upheld
the
lawfulness
of
all
three
of
these
new
regulations,
though
by
a
divided
vote
in
the
case
of
two
of
them.
we
considered
the
three
and
today
we
affirm
the
tenth
circuit.
we
explain
why
we
hold
the
regulations
lawful
in
our
opinion,
which
is
a
little
technical.
we
note
throughout
that
opinion,
but
the
secretary
has
considerable
authority
to
regulate
grazing,
but
also
we
note
that
many
of
the
adverse
consequences
that
the
ranchers
fear
including
unfair
departures
from
prior
practice
seem
unlikely
to
follow
merely
from
the
regulatory
amendments
that
we
are
considering.
and
in
any
event
if
those
consequences
did
occur,
individual
affected
ranchers
would
remain
free
to
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
the
regulations
when
applied
to
them,
at
that
time.
the
upshot
is
that
we
find
as
a
general
matter
that
the
changes
to
“one
of
the
statutory
requirements
do
not
constitute
a
failure
to
adequately
safeguard
grazing
privileges”,
they
need
the
other
relevant
statutory
requirement
as
well.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
o’
connor
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
