justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
do
not
understand
that
any
particular
member
of
your
association
can
show
right
now
that
he
is
going
to
be
worse
off
in
the
sense
of
having
left
forage
right
at
any
given
time
under
the
new
regulation
as
distinct
from
the
old
regulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
everyone
in
your
association
is
worse
off--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off,
but
i
think
you
have
made
that
clear.
but
so
far
as
the
forage
which
you
are
entitled
to
enjoy
at
any
given
moment,
now
or
a
year
from
now,
as
i
understand
it,
you
can't
say
that
any
member
of
your
association
is
going
to
be
worse
off
a
year
from
now
under
the
new
regs
than
he
would
have
been
under
the
old
ones,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
is,
what
forage
are
you
out
there
actually
exercising,
or
being
entitled
to
the
benefit
of,
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
can't
say
that
you
will
be
worse
off
a
year
from
now
under
the
new
regs
than
you
were
a
year
ago,
or
whatever,
in...
under
the
old
ones.
