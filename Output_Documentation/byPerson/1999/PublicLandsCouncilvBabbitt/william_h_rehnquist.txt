we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-1991,
public
lands
council
v.
bruce
babbitt.
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bishop,
i
think
you've
described,
and
i
think
perhaps
your
opponents
have
described,
the
proceeding
you've
brought
here
as
a,
quote,
facial
attack,
end
quote,
on
the
secretary's
regulations
that
are
challenged,
and
your
opponents
say,
well,
you...
except
in
a
first
amendment
case
you
can't
bring
a
facial
challenge,
and
are
you
using
the
term,
facial
challenge,
in
the
same
sense
we're
use
it
in
the
first
amendment
jurisprudence?
that
is,
that
you
can
challenge
a
law
even
though
it
doesn't
affect
you
adversely
if
it
affects
someone
else
adversely?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do
we--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
bishop,
where
do
we
find
section
3?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
and
whereabouts
on
page
104?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
what?
page
what,
mr.
bishop?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
try
to
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
claim--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--does
this
claim
stand
independently
of
the
adequately
safeguard
language
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
part
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
statute
requires
the
secretary
to
adequately
safeguard--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--these
preferences,
and
now
you've
gone
over
all
the
things
that
you
think
a
preference
conveys
to
your
clients.
is
that
a
separate
point,
or
is
that
just
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wait
till
i
finish
my
question,
will
you.
is
that
a
separate
point,
or
is
it
just
something
that
bears
on
the
adequately
safeguard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bishop.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right
on
the
first
clause
of
your
sentence
that
if
it
can
be
shown
that
this
is
permissible
in
any
conceivable
situation,
then
you
don't
even
have
to
get
to
the
other
parts
of
your
sentence.
it
was
permissible
under
the
statute,
broad
discretion,
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
do
you
take
the
position
that
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
perhaps
in
at
least
one
or
two
instances,
that
this
does
not
respond
to
the
challenge,
therefore
that's
good
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right
on
your
first
point,
a
court
opinion
would
never
get
to
the
others.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
put
it
in
roman
numerals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
are
the
'94
regulations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
on
125a?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
123,
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood
the
basic
argument
was
that
none
of
this
need
to
come
about
because
the
land
use
program
that
the
secretary
provided
for
could
negate
it,
and
i
thought
i
read
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
which
upheld
the
program
as
reading
that
way,
too.
the...
i
thought
the
tenth
circuit
said
we
just...
nothing
is
ripe
here,
not
that
this
is
just
the
same
old
regime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
about
a
sentence
after
the
language
that
you
quoted
to
us
about
the
discretion
of
the
secretary,
in
fact
it's
the
next
sentence,
it
says
during
periods
of
range
depletion
due
to
severe
drought
or
other
national...
natural
causes,
or
in
case
of
a
general
epidemic
of
disease
during
the
life
of
the
permit,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
hereby
authorized
in
his
discretion
to
remit,
reduce,
or
refund
in
whole
or
in
part
or
authorize
postponement
of
payment
of
grazing
fees.
now,
do
you
think
that
the
secretary's
discretion
is
just
general
in
the
part
you
read?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
it
suggests
that
the
secretary
could
simply
suspend
in
gross,
rather
than
case-by-case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
what
has
the
secretary
actually
done
with
respect
to
land
use
plans
following
the
enactment
of
this
law,
or
has
it
been
in
suspense
because
of
the
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
bishop,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bishop.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1991,
public
lands
council
versus
babbitt
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
