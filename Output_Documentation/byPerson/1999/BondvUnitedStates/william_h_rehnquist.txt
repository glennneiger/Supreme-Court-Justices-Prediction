chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
98-9349,
steven
dewayne
bond
v.
the
united
states.
ms.
fuentes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
would
have
to
contend...
well,
you
don't
contend
that
the
aisle
of
an
interstate
bus
is
not
a
public
place
for
this
purpose?
i
mean,
agent
cantu
had
a
perfect
right
to
be
in
the
aisle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
large
was
the
brick,
ms.
fuentes?
does
the
record
show
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right,
ms.
fuentes.
i
mean,
supposing
you
had
someone
who
had
the
same
experience
mr.
cantu
had,
he
now
retired
from
the
government
service
and
was
simply
pushing
and
shoving
without
any
particular
motive,
he
could
have
discerned
the
same
thing
that
agent
cantu
could,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
mean
just
with
respect
to
purpose
or
intent--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
mean
a
lot
more
manipulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
fuentes.
mr.
lamken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since
this
case
may
well
turn
on
rather
fine
spun
distinctions,
would
there
be
any
difference
between
the
situation
where,
by
simply
observing
the
bag,
and
there's
something
unusually
kind
of
sticking
out
that
you
can
tell,
and
this,
where
apparently
there
was
nothing
unusual
sticking
out,
and
it
required,
you
know,
pushing,
feeling,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
to
discern
the
methamphetamine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
an
unusual
bus
driver,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
it's
regarded
as
common
law
harm.
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
called
justice,
really,
in
common
law,
isn't
it?
well,
if
a
fellow
passenger
got
up
and
jarred
bond's
bag,
such
that
the
brick
fell
out,
i
don't
think
the
fellow
passenger
would
be
liable
for
damages
for
his
imprisonment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--let's
let
counsel--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
isn't
any
23,
or
at
least
the
appendix--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
joint
appendix
doesn't
seem
to
go...
the
transcript
doesn't
seem
to
go
beyond
page
20.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thanks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
ms.
fuentes,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
ms.
fuentes.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
98-9349,
steven
dewayne
bond
versus
united
states.
petitioner
bond
was
a
passenger
on
a
greyhound
bus
that
left
california
bound
for
little
rock,
arkansas.
a
border
patrol
agent
boarded
the
bus
at
a
place
called
sierra
blanca,
texas
which
is
about
80
miles
southeast
of
el
paso
on
interstate
10.
after
the
agent
had
checked
the
immigration
status
of
the
passengers
he
began
squeezing
the
soft
luggage
in
the
overhead
bins.
when
he
squeezed
petitioner’s
canvas
bag,
he
noticed
a
“brick-like”
object.
after
obtaining
petitioner’s
consent
to
open
the
bag,
the
agent
discovered
a
brick
of
methamphetamine.
the
brick
had
been
wrapped
in
duct
tape
until
it
was
oval-shaped
and
then
wrapped
in
a
pair
of
pants.
petitioner
was
indicted
for
conspiracy
to
possess,
and
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
methamphetamine.
he
moved
to
suppress
the
drugs,
arguing
that
the
border
patrol
agent
had
conducted
an
illegal
search
of
his
bag.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
petitioner
was
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reverse.
it
is
undisputed
that
petitioner
had
a
protected
privacy
interest
in
his
carry-on
bag.
the
government
argues
that
by
exposing
the
bag
to
public
handling
petitioner
lost
a
reasonable
expectation
that
it
would
not
be
physically
manipulated.
the
government
relies
on
our
cases
that
hold
that
matters
open
to
public
observation
are
not
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
but
those
cases
involved
visual
as
opposed
to
tactile
observation
and
thus
do
not
require
the
result
in
favor
of
the
government.
our
traditional
fourth
amendment
analysis
embraces
two
questions:
first,
we
ask
whether
the
individual
has
sought
to
preserve
something
as
private.
here
petitioner
sought
to
preserve
privacy
by
using
an
opaque
bag
and
by
placing
that
bag
directly
above
his
seat.
second,
we
ask
whether
an
individual’s
expectation
of
privacy
is
one
that
society
is
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable.
when
a
bus
passenger
places
a
bag
in
an
overhead
bin,
he
expects
that
other
passengers
or
bus
employees
may
move
it
for
one
reason
or
another,
but
he
does
not
expect
that
his
bag
will
be
physically
manipulated
in
an
exploratory
manner
and
that’s
exactly
what
happened
here.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
agent’s
conduct
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
