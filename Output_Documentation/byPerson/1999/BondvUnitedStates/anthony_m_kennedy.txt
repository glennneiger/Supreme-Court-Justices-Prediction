there's
a
difference
here
in
what
the
police
officer
did
and
what
the
fellow
passenger
does
to
justice
breyer's
luggage.
in
this
case
the
purpose
of
the
manipulation,
or
the
touching
of
the
bag,
was
to
see
what
was
inside.
that,
i
presume,
is
not
the
purpose
of
a
passenger.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
this
is
a
difference
that
the
law
ignores,
is
it
not?
we
do
not
ask
about
the
subjective
intention--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
the
person
that
touches
the
bag,
or
do
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
there
something
like
an
objective
purpose
that
we
look...
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
differences
to
which
the
law
is
blind,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
to
conclude
my
previous
question,
do
you
submit
the
case
on
the
proposition
that
the
purpose
of
the
search,
or,
rather,
the
touching,
is
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
do
you
have
some
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
degree
of
manipulation
point
and
the
questions
put
to
you
by
justice
stevens
and
justice
scalia,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
a
passenger
does
not
have
the
right
to
start
manipulating
my
luggage
to
see
what's
in
it.
is
that
a
tort?
it's
not
a
conversion.
there's
no
asportation
of
the
property.
i
just...
it's
not
an
assault,
because
an
inanimate
thing
can't
be
assaulted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
it
does,
although
it
seems
to
me
that
it's...
there's
some
level
of
wrong
occurring
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
agree
that
the
passenger
had
a
right
to
tell
the
policeman,
don't
feel
my
bag?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he
didn't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we've
been
through
that
in
florida
and
bostick,
in
which
we
said
that
the
police
officer
with
a
show
of
authority...
two
of
them
in
that
case,
in
fact,
with
guns
and
so
forth...
said,
may
i
search
your
bag,
and
we
said
the
passenger,
the
citizen
has
to
exercise
his
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
is,
the
passenger
was
there
and
didn't
try
to
stop
him.
he
had
the
right
to
do
it
if
he
wanted,
i
assume.
i'm
making
that
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
what
we'd
be
saying...
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
authority
for
it...
is
that
your
expectation
of
privacy
is
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
you
have
at
hand
the
means
to
protect
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
haven't
availed
yourself
of
that
means.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
where
bostick
comes
in,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
case
is
against
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
there
a
seizure
or
an
invasion
of
privacy
if
the
passenger
moves
your
object,
the
object
for
any
reason
other
than
to
make
room
for
his
or
her
own
luggage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
meaningful
deprivation
of
possessory
interest
is
defined
how?
the
injury
caused
to
the
owner,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
here,
the
injury
was
very
substantial,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
injury
to
the
owner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
he
has
no
standing
to
object,
he
hasn't
been
injured.
i
don't
understand
that.
he's
in
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
at
least...
at
least
that
was
in
the
visual
context.
i
think
you're
probably
right
about
that.
can
you
come
close
to
the
purpose
analysis
by
using
the
objective
criteria
of
how
long
and
how
intrusive
the
manipulation
was?
i
make
the
assumption...
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
i
make
the
assumption
that
the
police
officer
had
to
manipulate
this
piece
of
luggage
for
a
much
longer
period
of
time
and
much
more
intrusively
than
he
would
if
he
were
just
moving
it
from
one
side
of
the
bin
to
another.
if
i'm
right
about
that,
is
that
a
relevant
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
relevant,
or
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
a
finding
that
it
takes
10
seconds
to
move
a
bag,
and
it
took
over
45
seconds
to
manipulate
it,
would
that
be
a...
there
is
no
such
finding,
but
would
that
be
a
basis
on
which
we
could
and
should
decide
the
case
if
that
finding
were
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
accept
a
rule
that
the
police
cannot
touch
or
manipulate
or
probe
baggage
to
a...
any
greater
degree
than
a
passenger
might
do
in
moving
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
you
just
accepted
the
previous
premise
in
the
answer
to
my
earlier
question.
well,
all
our
cases
say
about
purpose
is
the
fact
it's
not
a
law
enforcement
purpose
doesn't
matter,
but
we
have
never
said
you
don't
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
activity.
we've
never
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
different--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
have
a
cause
of
action
if
someone
touches
your
chattel
and
thereby
causes
harm
to
you,
if
someone
trespasses
on
your
chattel
and
causes
harm
to
you,
which
is
what
happened
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
your
opposing
counsel
will
say
that
the
owner
is
in
jail
as
a
result
of
the
touching.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
not
intentional.
this
is
an
intentional
tort,
and
that's
the
difference.
there's
a
difference
between
intentional
and
unintentional
torts.
