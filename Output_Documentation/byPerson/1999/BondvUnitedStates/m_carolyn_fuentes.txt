mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:--
mr.
bond's
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
search
occurs
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
a
law
enforcement
officer
manipulates
a
bus
passenger's
carry
on
luggage
to
determine
its
contents.
if
manipulation
of
luggage
is
not
a
search,
then
law
officers
will
be
able
to
squeeze
and
feel
carry
on
luggage,
as
agent
cantu
did
in
mr.
bond's
case,
free
from
judicial
scrutiny
in
criminal
cases
and
without
any
fourth
amendment
requirement
that
their
actions
be
reasonable.
over
30
years
ago,
in
terry
v.
ohio,
this
court
said
that
it
is
sheet
torture
of
the
english
language
to
suggest
that
a
careful
exploration
all
over
the
outer
clothing
of
a
person's
body
is
not
a
search.
the
same
can
be
said
in
this
case.
the
principles
in
terry,
as
well
as
those
in
dickerson
v.
minnesota,
govern
this
case.
now,
the
government
says
that
they
do
not
and
says,
instead,
this
court's
public
exposure
cases
govern
the
determination
in
mr.
bond's
case.
the
flaw
in
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
fails
to
recognize
that
on
the
line
between
dickerson
and
terry
on
the
one
hand
and
the
public
exposure
cases
on
the
other,
mr.
bond's
case
falls
far
closer
to
the
facts,
circumstances,
and
legal
principles
in
dickerson
and
in
terry.
for
example,
terry
and
dickerson
involved
searches
of
outer
clothing
being
worn
by
a
person.
outer
clothing,
the
pockets
of
outer
clothing
in
particular,
serve
the
function
of
being
a
repository
of
personal
effects.
we
commonly
carry
our
personal
effects
on
our
clothing,
in
our
pockets.
a
travel
bag,
like
the
one
mr.
bond
carried,
serves
the
same
function.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
that's--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
of
course,
we
dispute
that,
your
honor.
we
think
that
mr.
bond
did
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
luggage,
and
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
to
be
free
from
a
government
tactile
examination
of
that
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
he
reasonably
expected
that
other
passengers
might
push
or
move
the
luggage
if
they
needed
to
make
room
for
their
own,
but
that
is
not
what
agent
cantu
did.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
they
could
have
squeezed
it,
but
again
that
is
not
what
agent
cantu
did.
when
we
get
on
a
bus
and
we
put
our
luggage
overhead,
the
expectation
is
that
if
another
passenger
needs
to
come
aboard
and
needs
room
in
that
luggage
bin,
maybe
he
will
push
it,
maybe
he
will
pull
it,
i
think
maybe
he
could
squeeze
it.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
in
that--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--in
that
case,
i
think
it's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
one
of
the
major
distinctions
between
mr.
bond's
case
and
the
public
exposure
cases
are
that
in
fact
those
observa...
the
observations
in
those
cases
and
in
the
example
that
you
just
gave
took
place
from
public
thoroughfares,
and
this
court
has
found
that
people
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
to
be
free
of
visual
observations
made
by
those
who
are
in
a
vantage
point
where
they
have
a
right
to
be.
that's--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
believe
you're
talking
about
minnesota
v.
carver--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
in
that
case
it
was
still
from
a
public
vantage
point.
a
street,
whether
it's
an
open
public
thoroughfare
or
open
area
next
to
a
house,
is
entirely
different
from
the
surface
of
mr.
bond's
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
he
did,
and
if
he
had
made
his
observations
from
the
aisle,
we
might
have
a
bad
case,
but
he
did
not.
the
observations
that
he
made
about
the
contents
of
mr.
bond's
luggage
were
made
from
the...
through
the
surface
of
his
luggage.
the
observations
weren't
made
just
from
the
bus.
they
were
made
from
the
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i'm
sorry.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
don't
think
that
is
the
analogy,
and
i
think
the
court
recognized
as
much
in
the
dickerson
case.
the
dickerson
case
involved
a
pat
down
of
a
person's
outer
pockets.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
certainly.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
yes,
i
would
agree,
and
that
is
another
point
that
distinguishes
mr.
bond's
case
from
the
public
exposure
cases.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
that
that
experience
is
the
reasonable
expectation.
they
need
to
move
the
luggage,
and
so
they
push
it
or
they
move
it.
agent
cantu
was
not
in
that
position.
i'll
give
you
an
example.
if
you're
on
the
plane
and
there
are
only
three
people
on
there,
and
there's
luggage
down
the
hall
and
there's
luggage
over
your
head,
you
don't
expect
that
someone
is
going
to
come
into
the
plane
and
start
squeezing
and
moving
your
luggage
when--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
think...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
think
we
do
have
a
good
idea
of
what
was
involved
if
we
look
at
agent
cantu's
testimony
itself.
agent
cantu
said
he
squeezed
the
bag,
and
he
described
what
he
felt.
he
felt
a
brick
of
methamphetamine,
which
is
a
rectangular
object.
now,
that
brick
was
wrapped
in--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--it
was
wrapped
with
duct
tape
until
it
became
oval
shaped.
then
it
was
wrapped
in
a
pair
of
pants.
then
it
was
placed
inside
a
canvas
bag
which
was
closed
to
the
public.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
the
brick
was
approximately
4
to
5
inches
wide
by
6
to
7
inches
long.
it
doesn't
give
the
third
dimension
of
the
brick.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
we
do--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--no,
i
don't
think
the
law
is
blind
to
it.
i
think
what
the
law
says
is
that
we...
is
that
an
officer's
subjective
motive,
or
subjective
intent,
may
not
serve
to
invalidate
objectively
justifiable
behavior,
and
i
think
that
was
the
court's
holding
in
the
whren
case.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
there
are
multiple
factors,
but
i
think
the
most
important
one
is
that
a
dog
sniff
is
incapable
of
revealing
anything
to
the
police
except
the
presence
of
contraband.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
i
don't
think
the
purpose
is
irrelevant
to
the
extent--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--yes,
i
hope
so.
[laughter]
to
the
extent
that
the
purpose
serves
to
describe
what
the
officer
has
done,
i
think
the
court
considers
it.
i'm
not
saying
look
at
what
was
in
agent
cantu's
head.
i'm
saying,
look
at
what
agent
cantu
did.
now,
he
told
you--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--let
me
go
back
first
to
the
purpose,
and
i
think
the
airplane
example
is
a
very
good
one.
the
purpose,
the
purpose
of
looking
down
from
an
airplane
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
the
officer
has
a
justifiable
reason
to
be
in
the
air.
it's
an
open,
public
air
space,
and
he
can
be
there
and
he
can
look
down
just
like
anybody
else
can.
in
mr.
bond's
case,
the
officer
did
not
have
the
same
sort
of
right
to
have
his
hands
on
mr.
bond's
luggage,
because
the
inside
of
a
bus
and
the
surface
of
luggage
is
not
like
open
public
air
space
or
other--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
don't--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
don't
think
so,
but
i
don't
know
the
court
has
to
reach
that
issue
for
the
second
part
of
the
question
that
justice
breyer
asked--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--in
deciding
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
i
think
this
court
looks
at
myriad
factors,
not
just
one
or
two,
and
in
the
garbage--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--no.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no,
i
don't
agree.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
correct.
i
don't
think...
a
person
retains
the
right
to
say,
get
your
hands
off
of
luggage,
and
that
helps
to
define
this
reasonable
expectation.
but
i--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--yes.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
yes,
but--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
agree,
but
as
to--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--as
to
the
garbage
first,
the
privacy
interest
in
garbage
is
far
different
than
the
privacy
interest...
the
expectations
may
be
the
same,
they
may
be
similar,
but
the
privacy
interest
in
garbage
is
far
different
from
the
privacy
interest
in
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
then
it's
abandoned.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
that
is
one
of
the
major
points
upon
which
mr.
bond's
argument
rests,
and
what
mr.
bond
did,
justice
breyer...
excuse
me.
what
agent
cantu
did
to
mr.
bond's
luggage
that
was
different
than
what
other
passengers
do
is
demonstrated
by
the
agent's
testimony.
any
passenger
pushing
or
pulling
luggage,
or
even
squeezing
luggage,
grasping
it,
would
not
have
been
able
to
discern
the
edges
of
a
rectangular
brick
which
had
been
wrapped
in
duct
tape
until
it
became
oval,
placed
in
a
pair
of
pants,
wrapped
in
a
pair
of
pants,
put
in
a
canvas
bag--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--no.
i
think
there's
a
difference.
i
think
agent
cantu's
experience
is
what
led
him
to
think
that
what
he
felt
was
narcotics,
but
it's
simply
the
same
sort
of
physical
manipulation
that
anybody
could
use
in
finding
out
what
that
brick
felt
like.
i
don't
think
anyone,
whether
they'd
been
trained
or
not,
can
feel
the
details
that
agent
cantu
described
unless
they
are
manipulating
that
bag
in
a
way
that
is
significantly
different
from
the
way
passengers
are
reasonably
expected
to
push
and--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
in
the
manner
in
which
the
bag
was
manipulated,
that's
correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
that
is--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
i
think
that
is
a
very
hard
question,
and
i
think--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--the
issue
in
mr.
bond's
case
could
be
decided
by
saying,
officers
cannot
squeeze
bags.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i'm
not
certain
that
it
rises
to
the
level
of
a
tort.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
if
the
officer...
if
agent...
agent
cantu
took
that
bag
and
he
converted
it
to
his
own
purpose.
it
doesn't
amount
to
a
conversion
because
it
wasn't
so
intrusive
that
it
would
be
a
conversion,
but
for
a
dispossession
of
property
in
tort
law
there
are
some
damages.
i
don't
know
if
it
would
rise
to
that
level,
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
tort
law
provides
a
privilege
to
mr.
bond
to
stop
even
harmless
interference
with
is
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no,
he
did
not.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
because
agent
cantu
was
able
to
feel
more
than
the
actions
you
described--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--by
his
testimony.
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a
rectangular
brick
whose
edges
were
so
disguised
by
duct
tape
that
it
was
described
as
an
oval
mass,
to
be
able
to
feel
those
rectangular
edges
through
duct
tape,
through--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
goes
back
to
expectations
of
privacy,
and
not
to
purpose,
but
to
how...
what
means
are
used
to
achieve
that
purpose.
for
example,
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
i
think
cannot
rest
on
the
extremes
of
conduct,
because
we
have
to
look
at
what
we
as
a
society,
a
civil
society,
expects
is
the
norm,
and
we
expect
that
maybe
the
flight
attendant,
or
maybe
someone
else
will
push
or
move
our
luggage.
but
when
a
uniformed
officer
comes
in
and
starts
squeezing
all
of
the
luggage,
clearly
from
his
actions
you
can
see
he's
trying
to
find
out...
and
i'm
not
talking
motive,
i'm
talking
manner.
you
can
see
that
he's
trying
to
find
out
what's
in
your
luggage,
that
is
an
incredible
intrusion
on
personal
security.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well,
i
think
that's
very
demonstrative
of
what
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
is.
the
way...
he
kept
it
with
him
on
the
bus.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
discounted.
i
think
that
probably
a
passenger's
first
line
of
defense,
and
best
line
of
defense
against
others,
is
keeping
his
luggage
with
him.
hard
backed
luggage,
of
course,
would
have
helped--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i...
he
expects
that
if
he
doesn't
like
the
way
people
are
feeling
it,
he
can
stop
them,
and
action
by
a
police
officer
is
different.
in
addition
to
that,
if
you
look
at
the
way
mr.
bond
wrapped
his
methamphetamine
brick,
that
wrapping
would
have
withstood
any
discoveries
by
passengers
who
are
moving
luggage
in
the
way
that
we
would
reasonably
expect.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
he
did.
i
think
he
had
a
right
to.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
agent
cantu
came
on
this
bus
with
a
show
of
authority.
the
bus
was
pulled
off
of
ih-10
for
border
for
an
immigration
inspection--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--agent
cantu
did
not
say,
may
i
squeeze
your
bag,
and
that
is
really
the
critical--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
think
he
did
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
the
difference
is,
agent
cantu
came
on
the
bus
and
started
questioning
people
about
their
citizenship
or
other
right
to
be
in
the
country.
he's
coming
on
board.
he's
demanding
answers
of
them.
he
doesn't
have
to
do
it
in
an
ugly
way,
but
he
is
telling
them,
you
must
answer
me
about
your
citizenship,
and
then,
without
a
do
you
mind
and
may
i
please,
he
starts
squeezing
their
luggage.
that
is
very
different
than
saying,
may
i
squeeze
your
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
he--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--correct.
the
officer
never
said,
mr.
bond,
may
i
squeeze
your
luggage.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
i
think
that's
when
the
expectation
of
privacy
was
violated,
when
he
saw
the
officer
squeezing.
he
expected,
reasonably,
as
we
all
do,
that
other
passengers
might
move
or
push
his
luggage
to
make
room
for
their
own,
but
it
is
very
startling,
and
it
is
an
invasion
of
personal
privacy,
when
a
law
officer
gets
on
and
starts
squeezing
those
bags.
another
example,
not--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
don't
think
so,
because
the
longer
he
squeezes
the
more
intrusive
it
is.
but
in
terms
of
consent
for
fourth
amendment
constitutional
purposes,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
accepted
mere
acquiescence
to
a
show
of
authority,
whether
it
is
short
or
whether
it
is
long,
as
consent.
there
has
to
be
an
affirmative
indication
that
the
person
has
consented
to
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
court
has
never
accepted
any
less.
now,
in
this
case,
let
me
return--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well,
you
haven't...
again,
the
circumstances
in
this
case
are,
you
haven't
availed
yourself
of
it
because
of
the
show
of
authority.
the
fact
that
the
right
exists,
i
think,
shows--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--again,
respectfully,
i
would
disagree,
because
if
agent
cantu
had
said
to
mr.
bond,
may
i
squeeze
your
luggage,
i
would
have
a
much
harder
case,
but
he
didn't.
he
just--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
think
you
wouldn't
like
it,
and
i
think
it
would--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--again,
you
pose
a
very
hard
question--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
we've...
this
court
has
approved
police
dogs
sniffing--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--luggage,
and
i
think
that
anything--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
think
i
would.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
because--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--again,
i
find
the
difference
between
luggage,
which
is
meant
to
safeguard
personal
belongings
and
kept
close
by,
the
difference
between
that
and
former
possessions
that
have
been
placed
in
a
bag
and
set
on
the
street
to
be
destroyed,
to
be...
it
is
a
qualitative
difference
that
i
think
shows
absolutely
different
privacy
interests.
in
this
case,
again
returning
to
privacy
interests,
i
think
that
if
you
were
to
see...
for
example,
if
there
were
a
bored
15-year-old
in
the
front
of
the
bus,
tired
of
the
layover,
who
decided
to
tap
out
a
tune
on
the
bags
in
the
overhead
bins
in
time
with
the
music
he
was
listening
to,
i
think
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy
because
it's
not
what
you
reasonably
expect.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
overall,
your
honor,
the...
all
of
the
government's
argument
is
based
on
the
knowing
exposure
of
mr.
bond's
bag,
and
those
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
on
knowing
exposure
vary
so
radically
from
mr.
bond's
situation
that
they
should
not
be
applied.
that
public
exposure
principle
has
been
applied
primarily
for
visual
observations
with
very
limited
exceptions,
the
garbage
case,
for
example,
and
luggage
is
different
than
garbage,
and
i
believe
maryland
v.
macon,
where
police
officers
went
into
a
store
where
people
were
invited
to
buy,
and
they
bought.
so
they
touched
it,
they
bought,
they
did
just
what
the
public
could
do.
but
on
that
line,
what
happened
to
mr.
bond
was
much
closer
to
dickerson
and
to
terry,
and
so
the
public
exposure
principle
should
not
be
applied.
instead,
the
limited
public
access
principles
in
mancuson
v.
deforte,
for
example,
just
because
other
people
have
access
to
our
office
doesn't
mean
that
the
police
can
have
access,
those
principles,
as
well
as
dickerson
and
terry,
are
more
applicable
in
this
case.
i
also
wanted
to
say
one
thing
about
purpose,
and
that
is
that
purpose
can
be
instructive
if
it
is
manifested
by
objective
actions,
and
that
purpose
is
what
helps
to
define
reasonable
expectations.
we
do
expect
that
other
passengers
may
move
our
luggage
for
the
purpose
of
making
room
for
their
own,
and
when
their
actions
go
beyond
that,
our
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
are
violated.
more
than
30
years
ago,
in
terry,
this
court
had
to
decide
whether
it
wanted
to
isolate
an
entire
range
of
police
conduct
from
fourth
amendment
constraints,
and
really
much
the
same
question
is
before
the
court
today.
will
the
police
be
permitted
to
manipulate
luggage
basically
as
much
as
they
want
under
the
government's
theory?
if
anything
could
have
been
observed
by
a
member
of
the
public,
then
the
police
are
entitled
to
observe
it.
will
they
be
able
to
do
that
outside
the
constraints
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
think
the
answer
should
be
no.
unless
the
court
has
any
more
questions--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--yes.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well,
i
think
the
answer
is,
the
reason
they
will
do
it
is
to
move
their
luggage,
and
your
expectations
would
be
violated
if
it
were
an
empty
bus
and
someone
came
and
started
touching
your
luggage
anyway,
and
when
our
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
are
violated
by
private
persons,
that
doesn't
matter
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
but
when
the
government
does
it,
and
agent
cantu
did
it
in
this
case,
that
is
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
unless
it
is
done
with
some
sort
of
individualized
suspicion,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
