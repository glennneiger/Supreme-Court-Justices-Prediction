what
do
i
do
with
the
following
problem
for
me,
which
is,
i
fly
quite
a
lot
up
to
boston
and
so
forth,
and
i
put
bags
all
the
time
in
the
upper
thing,
and
people
are
always
moving
them
around.
they
push
them,
they
lift
them
up,
they
move
them
to
other
places,
and
if
they're
soft
they
would
feel
just
what
was
in
the
inside.
now,
that
happens
all
the
time,
and
i
do
it
myself,
frankly.
i
move
somebody
else's
bag
and
push
mine
in,
and
i
imagine
the
interstate
bus
here
was
no
different.
so
if
that
happens
all
the
time,
how
can
i
say
that
your
client
has
some
kind
of
special
expectation,
since
in
my
own
experience,
people
are
always
handling
this
soft
luggage?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
he
object?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
is
it
different
physically
from,
say,
what
happens
occasionally...
one
of
the
flight
attendants,
or
maybe
a
passenger
will
take
my
canvas
bag
out,
they'll
be
holding
it,
they'll
move
it
to
a
different
compartment,
they'll
push
it
around,
and
i
guess
they
can
feel
something.
now,
how...
physically
what
happened,
how
is
it
different
from
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
one
way
you
might
win
is,
we'd
say
there's
a
difference
between
the
manipulation
physically
and
taking
the
bag
out
and
moving
it
from
one
place
to
another.
there
had
to
be
more
here.
is
there
any
other
way
you
could
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
thing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
purpose
would
certainly
matter
in
justice
souter's
example,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
imagine
that
i
have
a
particular
kind
of
object,
and
it's
almost
always
going
to
be
mine,
and
no
one
will
ever
touch
it,
but
we
have...
we
can
dream
up
some
weird
purpose
for
which,
i
guess,
it
would
be
touched.
well,
the
fact
that
99
percent
of
the
time
it
wouldn't
be
touched,
but
it
would
be
touched
for
one
weird
purpose
1
percent
of
the
time,
wouldn't
that
be
highly
relevant
to
my
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
so
you
would
say
in
respect
to
the
fact
that
i
have
a
package,
and
the
only
time
i
expect
somebody
else
to
touch
it
is
when
they
drop
it,
is
that
doesn't
show
the
purpose
of
dropping
it's
irrelevant.
it
just
shows
it
doesn't
happen
very
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
person
in
that
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
all
right,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'll
ask
you
one...
i
mean,
when
i
came
into
this,
i
thought,
well,
it
isn't
that
hard.
maybe
it
is
harder,
but
the
real
question's
just
whether,
when
you
put
this
luggage
up
in
a
place,
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
that
somebody
could
go
and
feel
the
brick,
and
if
the
answer's
yes,
then
he
has
no
expectation.
the
answer's
no,
he
does.
all
right,
now,
on
that
theory
the
only
way...
the
answer
must
be
yes,
there's
a
good
chance
somebody
would
feel
the
brick
unless
it
requires
a
special
hard
touch,
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
what?
i'm
not
sure.
