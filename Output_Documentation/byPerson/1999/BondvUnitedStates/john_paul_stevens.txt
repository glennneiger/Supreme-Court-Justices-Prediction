paul

do
you
agree
with
justice
scalia...
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you...
that
if
you're
a
passenger...
first
of
all,
i
take
it
your...
a
bus
case
isn't
like
an
airplane
because
you
don't
have
the...
luggage
doesn't
go
through
any
kind
of
a
detector.
i
suppose
you
have
much
less
expectation
of
privacy
on
airplanes
than
you
do
on
buses.
but
do
you
agree
that
a
person
has
no
right
to
tell
someone
else,
don't
squeeze
my
bag
to
see
what
you
can
find,
what's
in
it,
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
agree
with
the
premise
of
justice
scalia's
question,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lamken,
supposing
the
passenger
put
a
sign
on
his
bag
that
said,
fragile,
please
do
not
touch?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the...
what
if
he
kept
it
in
his
lap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
had
it
under
the
seat?
what
if
he
had
it
under
his
seat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
somebody
else
needed
to
use
it.
sometimes
you
have
to
put
two
bags
under
a
seat.
if
there
was
another
person's
bag
under
the
seat,
would
it
then
be
okay
to
search
it,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
bus
was
empty,
except
for...
and
he
had
the
choice
of
putting
it
in
the
seat
or
an
entirely
overhead
bin,
and
only
one
bag
up
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
even
on
an
empty
bus,
if
he
made
the
mistake
of
putting
it
up
in
the
overhead
bin
he
would
allow
it
to
be
searched,
but
if
he
put
it
under
the
seat,
it
could
avoid
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
squeezing
them
and
moving
them
from
side
to
side.
was
he
shaking
any
of
them?
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
18.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference?
that's
really
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
argue
it?
let's
assume
he
took
45
seconds,
then.
you'd
say
that
wouldn't
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
asking
us
to
draw
a
line
that
based
between
15
seconds
and
45
seconds--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there's
a
constitutional
difference
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
if
that's
your
view,
then
on
a
bus
sometimes
they
have
a
compartment
for
luggage
kind
of
underneath,
and
all
the
stored
luggage
goes
in
there
together.
he
could
say
to
the
driver,
unload
all
that
luggage.
i
want
to
squeeze
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
not
checked.
it's
just,
you
know,
on
the...
you...
the
driver,
the
bus
driver
often
will
take
the
luggage
from
the
passenger
and
put
it
in
kind
of
a
bin
under
the
truck,
and
then
when
they
get
to
the
destination
they
unload
it
all
out
together,
and
you
pick
out
your
bag.
now,
would
they...
would
the...
would
your
agent
have
a
right
to
say
to
the
driver,
i
want
to
go
through
all
that
luggage
down
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
it's
closed
overhead,
he
can
look
at
it,
but
if
it's
closed
under
the
bus,
he
cannot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you've
never
ridden
on
buses,
i
guess.
you
only
ride
airlines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
the
expectation
of
privacy
on
the
airline,
because
it's
all
x
rayed
as
you
go
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
an
entirely
different
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can--
--well,
could
he
then
say,
i
want
to
see
all
the
stuff
in
the
front
of
the
airline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
question
is,
would
it
be
constitutional
if
it
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
may
not
be
understanding...
i'm
asking
if,
under
your
view,
if
a
lot
of
luggage
is
put
in
either
the
rear
of
the
bus,
or
underneath
the
bus
as
it
sometimes
is,
the
agent
could
say,
i
want
to
squeeze
all
that
luggage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
