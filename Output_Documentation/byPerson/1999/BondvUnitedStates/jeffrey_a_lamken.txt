mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:--
placing
a
bag
in
the
overhead
rack
of
a
public
conveyance
like
a
bus
necessarily
subjects
it
to
touching
and
handling
by
other
members
of
the
traveling
public
who
may
need
to
move
or
push
on
the
luggage
to
make
room
for
additional
bags,
to
retrieve
previously
stowed
bags,
or--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
very
well
may
occur,
justice
o'connor,
because
when
bags
are
so
handled
the
sense
of
touch
inevitably
operates,
so
if
a
passenger
places
his
hands
on
a
piece
of
luggage
to
push
it
or
snug
it
into
the
rack,
he
may
very
well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
possible,
your
honor.
the
distinction,
however,
and
the
principle
that
governs
the
case,
is
one
of
knowing
exposure.
that
which
any
other
member
of
the
traveling
public
might
have
observed
is
knowingly
exposed,
and
the
agent
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
observing
it.
that's
not
to
say
that
the
agent
can
manipulate
the
bag
in
any
way
or
for
any
extended
period
of
time.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
there's
a
very
good
possibility
that
touching
that
bag
notwithstanding
the
sign
would
be
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would
have
a
very...
i
would
hesitate
to
call
it
a
search,
on
the
other
hand,
because
this
cases...
this
court's
cases
in
oliver
and
dunn,
for
example,
make
it
clear
that
violating
signs
on
land
that
say,
no
trespass,
do
not
convert
the
entry
on
land
into
a
search,
but
it
may
very
well
be
a
meaningful
deprivation
of
the
individual's
possessory
interest--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
would
be
a
search.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
would
that
constitute...
well,
if
it's
private
conduct
it
would
not
be
governed
by
the
fourth
amendment
at
all,
but
if
a
passenger
moves
it
for
any
other
reason,
i
don't...
still
don't
think
that
would
be
a
meaningful
deprivation
of
a
possessory
interest,
which...
so
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
that
the
owner's
dominion
or--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
injury
to
the
chattel
of
any
variety.
there
was
no
damage
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
he
was
caught
with
drugs
and
sent
to
jail?
i'm
not
sure
that's
an
injury
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
expect
that
would
not
occur.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
does
not
have
standing
to
seek...
file
a
motion
to
suppress,
but
in
terms
of
the
bag
being
moved,
if
you're
applying
common
law
standards,
which
would
be
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
for
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
there
certainly
wouldn't
be
any
sort
of
tort,
because
there
is
no
damage
to
the
chattel,
the
object
was
not
meaningful...
he
wasn't
deprived
of
possession
of
it
for
any
meaningful
period
of
time,
and
in
the
absence
of
those
conduct
there
would
be
no
trespass
to
chattel.
in
addition,
the
tort
of
trespass
to
chattel
wouldn't
occur
if
contact
with
the
bag
were
privileged,
and
that
is,
all
the
other
passengers
would
be
privileged
by
custom,
and
i
think
the
restatement
in
892(d)
makes
it
clear,
besides
which,
your...
all
the
other
passengers--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
law
treats
items
that
are
on
the
person
and
in
the
person's
grasp
as
if
they're
part
of
the
person
itself.
if
the
object
is
in
his
lap,
the
officer
would
not
be
permitted
to
touch
it,
and
no
other
member
of
society
would--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--to
the
extent
that's
an
area
reserved
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
passenger
sitting
behind
the
seat,
that
would
not
be
a
public
area.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
ordinarily,
justice
stevens,
the
rule
would
be
that
the
area
under
the
seat
in
front
of
you
is
reserved
exclusively
for
your
use
and
possession.
it's
part
of
your
seat,
effectively.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
again,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
happenstance
that
the
bus
is
empty
does
not
convert
an
area
that
is
ordinarily
shared
with
other
passengers--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
area
under
the
seat
is
reserved
exclusively
for
his
use
under
most
circumstances,
and
you
would
not
expect
other
passengers
to
be
pushing
or
touching
or
having
contact
with
the
bag
in
that
area.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think,
your
honor,
in
both
cases
the
question
is
one
of
knowing
exposure.
was
there
something
that
any
member
of
the
traveling
public,
or
any
other
member
of
the
traveling
public
could
have
observed
during
handling
of
the
bag?
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
then
it's
knowingly
exposed
and
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
inquiry,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
inquiry
is
one
of
knowing
exposure.
again,
if
this
is
the
type
of
item
that
another
member
of
the
traveling
public
could
have
felt
while
handling
the
bag,
such
as
by
pushing
on
it
to
snug
into
the
rack,
or
grabbing
the
bag
to
remove
it
from
the
rack,
then
it's
knowingly
exposed,
and
the
officer's
observation--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
i
think
we
would
lose
if
that
were
the
case,
and...
now--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
you
would
choose
the
latter,
for...
because
it's
consistent
with
this
court's
cases,
for
example.
in
sorallo
and
raleigh,
for
example,
the
dissent
contended
that
other
people
flying
over
the
yard
wouldn't
stare
down.
they
might
want
to
glance
down--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
the
two...
the
same
fourth
amendment
principles
apply
to
both
cases,
but
they
may
turn
out
to
yield
different
results.
there
are
many
fewer--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
that
is
correct,
and
there
are
many
circumstances
where
one
would
knowingly
expose
their
person,
for
example,
to
visual
observation,
and
i
can't
imagine
any
circumstances
where
they'd
knowingly
expose...
we'd
say
they'd
knowingly
expose
their
person
to
tactile
observation.
but
one
of
the
few
circumstances
in
which
something
is
knowingly
exposed
to
the
touch
of
other
people
is
when
a
bag
is
placed
in
an
overhead
rack
in
a
public
conveyance.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
distinction
i
think
turns
on
the
purpose
with
which
someone
is
acting.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
that's
not
a
purpose
that
the
law
recognizes
in
the
fourth
amendment--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
those
are
individual
subjective
reactions
to
how
certain
observations
are
made.
purpose
may
make
a
difference.
we
may
respond
differently
to
someone
who
happens
to
glance
up
through
a
window
and
see--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--compared
to
someone--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
the...
i
think
you
are
wrong
there,
with
respect,
justice
souter,
and
the
reason
that
is
as
follows.
whether
one's
expectation
of
privacy
is
reasonable
or
not
does
not
vary
with
the
intent
of
the
actor.
it's
either
knowingly
exposed
to
the
public,
and
that
is
the
type
of
thing
you
would
expect
to
be
touched
or
seen,
or
it
is
not,
and
the
actor's
intent--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
your
honor.
the
general...
sorallo
would
probably
be
our
best
case.
the
dissent
again
contended
that
the
purpose
was
law
enforcement,
and
this
was
not
simply
a
fly
by
for
ordinary
purposes
like--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
don't
think
you're
right
about
that,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
a...
well,
it
is
a
relevant
factor,
certainly,
because
an
officer
in
our
view
is
entitled
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
is
relevant.
it
is
pertinent.
it
doesn't
take
that
long
for
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
observe
all
of
those
aspects
of
a
piece
of
luggage
that
are
knowingly
exposed
to
the
rest
of
the
public.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
but
i
think
the
amount
of
time
spent
is
a
relevant
factor,
and
this
is
why.
it
doesn't
take
that
long
for
an
officer
to
observer
all
those
things
that
were
knowingly
exposed.
other
passengers,
for
example,
might
push
on
a
bag
to
snug
it
in
a
rack.
the
officer,
therefore,
may
push
on
the
bag
in
all
of
the
various
locations
that
a
passenger
might,
because
all
of
those
things
were
knowingly
exposed.
other
passengers
might
grab
a
bag
to
remove
it
from
the
rack.
the
officer
therefore
may
grab
the
bag
from
all
the
different
angles
another
passenger
might,
because
all
of
those
angles
are
knowingly
exposed.
that
actually
does
not
take
all
that
long.
the
dea
advises
us
that
it's
a
reasonably
brief
period
of
time,
typically
far
less
than
30
seconds,
so
if
the
officer
took
longer
than
a
reasonably
brief
period
of
time,
it
might--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
it
is
not.
it's
simply
what
we
have
been
advised,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
the
officer
did
this
with
the
bag.
the
only
thing
the
record
reflects
is
that
the
officer
grabbed
the
bag,
he
squeezed
the
bag
hard,
and
when
he
did
that,
he
felt
a
solid
object
that
he
thought
might
be
drugs.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
if
you
look
to
page,
for
example--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
that's
actually
not
agent...
the
agent's
testimony.
that
is
the
defendant's
testimony.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
on
page
18,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
he
actually
handled
the
bag
for
a
greater
period
of
time...
excuse
me.
that
he
had
repeated
squeezings
of
the
bag
or
anything
else.
the
only
thing
it
reflects
is
that
he
grabbed
the
bag
once.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
we
don't
believe
it
would
make
a
difference,
because
we
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
if
he
took
45
seconds,
that
could
raise
an
inference
that
he
was
observing
things
that
other
members
of
the
public--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor,
we're
not.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we're
not.
we
think
the
district
courts
would
fulfill
their
normal
fact
finding
function
in
this
context.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
scalia,
we
could
take
that
position,
and
it
would
be
certainly
a
defensible
one.
when
people
do
push...
in
fact,
it
may
be
even
more
defensible
than
impolite
people.
someone
who's
grabbing
a
bag
in
order
to
move
it
may
very
well
be
keenly
aware
of
what
they're
grabbing
to
make
sure
they
don't
break
something
or
to
make
sure
they
support
a
heavy
object
which
is
loosely
packed
in
the
bag,
so
people
may
actually,
even
when
they're
being
polite,
explore
the
contents
of
the
luggage
to
some
degree.
however,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
because
the
contact
was
not
particularly
extended,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
suggests--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
i
think
in
most
cases
it
will
be
relative,
a
relatively
simple
process.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
actually,
i
think
what
i
mean
to
exclude
are
the
extremes,
where
based
on
the
evidence
you
have
the
micromanipulation
and
the
rearrangement
of
the
contents
of
the
luggage,
such
that
it's...
the
officer's
enabled
to
observe
that
which
no
other
passenger
could
potentially
have
observed,
and
in
that
case
we
would
say
that
it
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
we
would
not,
because
that
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
principle
of
knowing
exposure.
the
officer
is
permitted
to
observe
all
those
things
that
were
knowingly
exposed
to
other
members
of
the
traveling
public.
objects--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--again,
because
i
think
that
distinction
turns
on
the
purpose
of
the
handling,
it's
not
one
that
the
law
recognizes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
you
have
in
sorallo,
your
honor.
you
said
quite
squarely
that
the
officer's
purpose
was
to
observe
marijuana
is
irrelevant.
i
mean,
the
court
used
the
word
irrelevant.
that
would
be
on
page
213--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--what
it
would
be
relevant
to
is
whether
you
consider
the
object
knowingly
exposed.
the
frequency
with
which
other
people
handle
your
luggage,
for
example,
if
it
were
never
the
case
that
people
touch
luggage
on
overhead
racks,
and
it
were
prohibited--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
it
would
show
that
when...
if
the...
unless
the
package
is
dropped,
you
would
expect
that
no
one
else
would
handle
it,
but
once
the
package
is
dropped,
you
would
expect
that
people
would.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
whether
they're
handling
it
for
law
enforcement
purposes
or
otherwise
is
irrelevant.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
but
their
handling
it
once
it's
dropped,
and
once
it's
dropped
on
the
ground,
it's
fair
game
for
someone
to
pick
it
up
and
hand
it
back
to
you,
regardless
of
what
their
subjective
intent
is.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor,
it
would--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
they're
closed
or
open
variety,
and
the
reason
is,
whether
or
not
it's
closed,
it
is
a
shared
location
with
other
members
of
the
traveling
public.
it
is
not
a
location--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
if
you
were
to
do--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
check...
there's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
handling
of
checked
luggage,
either.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
would
normally
expect
the
bus
driver
to
do
it.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i...
you
know,
i
don't...
the
problem
is,
i'm
not
understanding
the
circumstances
you're
describing.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
probably
the
answer,
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
that's
probably
it.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
don't
think
that's
the
critical
factor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
on
an
airline,
sometimes
larger
bags
are
taken
to
another
compartment
at
the
front
of
the
airplane,
for
example,
where
it's...
other
people's
luggage
is
placed.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
you
wouldn't
normally
expect
him
to
do
that,
but
you
would
also
expect
other
people--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--unless
the
bus
driver
is
a
government
agent,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
a
constitutional
question,
because
private
conduct
doesn't
implicate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
the
law
enforcement
agent.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
if
it's
a
shared
location,
and
other
passengers
have
access...
were
going
to
have
access
to
it,
like
it's
time
to
unload
the
stuff,
it
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--he
pulls
it
out
and
puts
it
on
the
floor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--outside
the
bus--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--and
then
all
the
passengers
gather
round
and
grab
what's
theirs.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
other
passengers
may
handle
your
bag
to
get
at
their
bags,
they
may
look
at
your
bag
in
order
to
determine
whether
it's
theirs.
i
think
again
we
would
consider
that
knowingly
exposed
to
touching
and
handling
by
other
members
of
the
traveling
public.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
he's
the
one
who
pulls
them
out,
but
other
members...
but
they're
presented
out
on
the
ground--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
as
you're
moving
the
hypothetical
towards
an
example,
for
example,
like
a
coat
check
in
a
restaurant--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--okay.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
in
that
case
you
would
have
to
say
that
you
would
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
there's
only
one
other
person
with
whom
you
have
an
established
relationship.
that
is,
the
bus--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--for
the
same
reason
that,
for
example,
in
a...
you
may
give
access
to
your
hotel
room
to
the
maids
and
the
janitors
and
the
manager,
but
you
don't
necessarily
mean
that
the
whole
world
or
law
enforcement
officers
can
enter
your
hotel
room.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
he
doesn't--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--there's
an
established
commercial--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
i
think
you
expect
other
passengers
to
have
contact
with
your
bag.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
principle
of
law,
if
you're
looking
to
common
law
the
principle
is
that
you'd
have
no
expectation
that
anybody...
if
it's
placed
in
a
shared
and
common
location,
where
the
custom
is
that
other
people
handle
it,
then
you
would
have
no
cause
of
action
if
somebody
else
handled
it,
and
you'd
have
no--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i...
justice
kennedy,
i
can't
fathom
what
the
nature
of
the
harm
is.
i
think
they'd
have
to
injure
the
chattel
and
deprive
you
of
possession
of--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that...
certainly
that
would
give
you
standing
to
seek
suppression
of
the
evidence,
but
that
would
not
be
sufficient
for
purposes
of
a
tort
action.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
no,
it
wouldn't
be
regarded
as
a
common
law
harm.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
i
don't
think
that
would--
[laughter]
he
certainly
would
not,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
good
analogy.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
again,
i
think
a--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--exactly,
since
he's
not
an
agent
of
the
state.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
coatrooms
that
i've
seen,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
anybody
else
ever
to
have
contact
with
your
possessions,
with
your
coats,
and
certainly
not
the
pockets.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
if
it
begins
to
resemble
and
have
the
characteristics
of
the
overhead
rack,
then
we
would
agree
that
you
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
record
for
one
moment,
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
thing.
whether
or
not
the
object
was
disguised
in
the
various
ways
that
petitioner
declares
would
not
make
much
of
a
difference
to
the
agent
feeling
the
package,
since
what
they're
attuned
to
are
things
that
are
signature
disguises.
but
the
record
also
does
not
reflect
that
this
was
a
rectangular
object
that
was
then
so
wrapped
in
duct
tape
that
it
somehow
became
rounded.
at
page
23
of
the
transcript,
the
agent
describes
it
as
a
brick
with
rounded
edges,
and
it
was
a
brick
with
rounded
edges,
so
it
could
also
be
described
as
an
oval
mass.
in
fact,
petitioner's
own
brief
in
the
district
court
described
the
object
as
an
oval
brick.
it's
for
that
reason
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
construe
the
record
as
having
an
object
that
had
sharp
edges
and
was
so
wrapped
up
in
brick...
in
tape--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--joint
appendix?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
26,
i
think...
oh,
if
you're
talking
about--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's...
joint
appendix,
page
26,
is
the
district
court
opinion
quoting
petitioner's
description
of
it
as
an
oval
brick;
in
the
transcript
pages,
page
53,
which
does
not
appear
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
your
honor.
