we
had
a
case
that
involved
an
apartment
building
and
the
police
went
right
next
to
the
particular
apartment.
it
wasn't
a
public
road,
and
it
wasn't
the
air
space
above.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
make
the
analogy
to
abandoned
property?
if
you
put
your
garbage
out
there,
it's
gone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
somebody
has
a
piece
of
luggage,
and
the
police
officer
says,
whose
is
this,
and
nobody
answers,
then
it's
abandoned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here,
i
think
your
case
is
resting
on
the
difference
between
ordinary
pushing
and
shoving
and
taking
a
bag
and
feeling
around
like
this,
which,
at
least
from
my
experience
on
airlines,
doesn't
happen.
people
jam
their
stuff
in.
they
don't
take
it
out
and
feel
here
and
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
bostick
it
rested
on
consent.
the
question
was
asked.
here,
there
was
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--endeavor
to
obtain
consent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
lamken,
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
this
was
not
pushing,
shoving,
that
this
was
deliberate
manipulation,
and
that's
a
distinction
that
you
don't
deal
with
when
you
say,
well,
passengers
could
grab,
passengers
could
shove.
this
was
admittedly
a
manipulation,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
an
expectation
that
your
fellow
passengers
are
going
to
take
your
luggage
and
go
like
this
around
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have...
you
have
his
exact
testimony
some
place
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
fellow
passenger
is
not
an
agent
of
the
state,
so
it
would
take
away
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
were
about
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
cloakroom,
and
that
seems
to
me
the
same
thing.
you
hang
up
your
coat
in
a
public
space,
so
why
couldn't
the
police
go
into
every
coatroom
and
start
manipulating
what's
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
are
plenty
of
coatrooms
where
there
is
no
attendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
just
put
your
coat
there.
you
may
put
your
bag,
hard
or
soft--
