o'connor
well,
ms.
fuentes,
you
know,
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
evidence
here
about
exactly
what
agent
cantu
did.
it's
very
sparse.
he
felt...
the
district
court
said
only
that
agent
cantu
felt
the
bag,
so
we
really
don't
know
what's
involved,
more
than
the
passenger
shoving
it
around
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
turned
out
it
was
an
oval,
not
a
brick
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
distinguish
the
dog
sniff
cases,
where
we've
upheld
the
use
of
police
dogs
to
sniff
luggage
for
narcotics?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
he
have
as
much
of
a
right
as
a
fellow
passenger
would
have--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
manipulate
the
luggage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
do
they
squeeze
and
manipulate
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
disclose
contents
by
virtue
of
the
kind
of
handling
that's
done?
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
you
could,
but
i
would
think
there
would
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
squeezing
and
manipulation
that
would
occur
to
identify
objects
within
a
bag
than
would
occur
normally
when
you
just
move
it
to
make
more
room
for
your
own.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
lamken,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
luggage
is
in
a
closed
luggage
compartment
or
an
open
one?
on
airplanes
and
some
buses
there
are
cupboard
doors
that
close,
so
the
luggage
is
all
in
there
and
behind
the
door.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
it
reasonable
to
expect
that
a
police
officer
could
come
on
board
and
open
the
luggage
compartment
and
then
squeeze?
does
that
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think--
