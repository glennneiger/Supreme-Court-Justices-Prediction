justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
he
was
standing
in
the
aisle.
isn't
that
the
point
of
the
analogy?
he
did
the
feeling
while
he
was
standing
in
an
aisle
where
at
least
public
to
the
extent
of
bus
passengers
were
free
to
be,
just
as
the
person
who
peeps
in
the
window
is
doing
so,
on
your
reasoning,
from
a
place
where
that
person
has
a
right
to
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
it
seems
to
me,
and
this
was
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
comment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on.
what
is
crucial
is
not
where
they
were
standing,
but
what
they
were
doing.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
draw
a
line
between
looking,
which
is
basically
free,
and
feeling,
which
is
not
basically
free?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
he
do
that's
different,
because
if
you're...
that's...
justice
kennedy
had
exactly
the
question
that
i
was
thinking.
purpose
doesn't
seem
relevant.
i
mean,
inso...
because
if
it
were
relevant,
obviously,
if
you
fly
the
plane
over
and
look
down
at
the
marijuana
fields,
your
purpose
is
a
search
if
you're
a
policeman,
and
not
if
you're
not.
the
peeping
tom
example
that
justice
scalia
gave
is
the
same.
did
he
do
something
different?
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there...
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
expectation
of
privacy
change
at
the
moment
he
saw
the
officer
squeezing
and
he
did
not
object?
is
that
relevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
officer
has
stood
there
squeezing
the
thing
for
15
minutes
and
he
had
said
nothing?
would
we
at
that
point
be
able
to
infer
a
consent,
or
at
that
point,
alternatively,
would
we
be
able
to
say,
the
terms
of
the
bus
travel
in
fact
had
changed
whatever
his
original
expectation
may
have
been,
and
he
no
longer
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
would
that
be
a
valid
line
of
reasoning?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
because--
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you're
making
two
different
assertions.
you're
saying
if
the
bag
and
its
palpability
is
knowingly
exposed
to
the
public,
the
police
can
take
advantage
of
that,
and
you're
also
saying
that
whatever
the
public
can
do,
the
police
can
do,
the
public
in
this
case
at
least
being
fellow
passengers.
in
the
latter
example,
the
only
thing
that
you
in
effect
consent
or
understand
that
your
fellow
passengers
will
do
will
be
to
make
room
for
their
own
luggage.
you
do
not
understand
that
your
fellow
passengers
are
going
to
work
their
way
up
and
down
the
bus
feeling
other
people's
luggage
to
see
if
anything
interesting
turns
up.
so
if
the
criterion,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
other
passengers
can
do,
then
what
this
officer
was
doing
was
outside
of
that,
and
would
be
outside
the
reasonable
expectation.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
abstract
from
that
and
say,
anything
that
could
be
felt
by
the
public
can
be
felt
by
the
police,
you're
at
a
different
level
of
generality,
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
why
should
we
take
the
abstract
proposition,
anything
feelable
can
be
felt
by
the
police,
as
opposed
to
your
other
proposition,
that
what
the
passengers
can
do
the
police
can
do?
why
do
we
choose
one
rather
than
the
other
to
answer
the
question
of
what
is
a
reasonable
expectation?
justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
but
you're
making...
your
argument
there
makes
the
assumption
that
touching
and
looking
are
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
identical,
and
i
don't
see
that
identity
at
all.
we
in...
generally
in
society
i
think
we
accept
the
fact
that
what
is
out
there
to
be
seen
can
be
looked
at,
and
we
may
be
irritated
when
someone
stares,
for
example,
but
we
don't
say,
you
know,
you're
doing
something
wrong.
it's
a
question
of
etiquette
and
that's
all.
but
when
it
comes
to
touching,
that's
a
very
different
thing.
people
can
stare
at
you
on
the
street,
but
if
they
start
coming...
patting
down
your
pockets,
i
think
you're
going
to
feel
that
a
different
value
is
involved,
and
for
that
reason
i
don't
see
how
you
can
equate
looking
with
touching.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
basic
principle
is
one
of
reasonable
expectation,
and
the
reasonable
expectation
in
looking,
or
being
seen,
is
different
from
the
reasonable
expectation,
or
the
expectation
about
being
touched,
or
explored
by
someone
who
is
touching
to
find
out
what
he
can
feel.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is...
yes,
but
there
again,
you
make
the
argument
easy
when
you
make
it
at
that
generality
and
say,
it's
exposed
to
touching.
what
it
is
exposed
to
is
to
being
moved
to
make
room
for
other
luggage.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
know
that
that
is
so.
i
mean,
our
purpose
inquiry,
again,
turns
at
different
levels.
justice
david
h.
souter
take
a
nonlaw
enforcement
example.
we
both
agree
that
generally
speaking
we
expose
ourselves
to
being
looked
at,
but
we
don't
expose
things
that
we
carry
to
being
touched,
so
if
somebody
comes
up
to
you
on
the
street
and
starts
feeling
the
package
you
have
in
mind,
you'd
tell
them
to
get
away.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
drop
the
package
and
someone
politely
comes
along
and
picks
it
up
for
you,
even
though
they're
touching
it,
you'd
say
thank
you.
in
that
sense,
at
that
level
of
purpose,
purpose
matters
a
very
great
deal
to
reasonable
expectation,
and
that's
the
suggestion
that
i'm
making
about
the
purpose
for
which
luggage
is
touched.
it
is
touched
for
the
purpose
of
being
moved,
not
for
the
purpose
of
being
explored,
and
i
don't
see
why
that
is
not
a
relevant
consideration
for
the
law
in
judging
reasonable
expectation.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
just--
justice
david
h.
souter
--just
one
thought.
i'm
intending,
at
least,
to
suggest
something
more
than
a
personal
idiosyncracy.
what
i
was
intending
to
describe
i
think
was
a,
kind
of
a
generally
shared
set
of
expectations.
if
you
think
i'm
wrong
there,
i...
you
know,
i'll
stand
corrected,
but
i
think
it's
something
more
than
just
personal
subjectivity
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
it
simple
here?
i
mean,
the
only
thing
i've
found
on
this
is,
the
owner
says
he
reached
for
my
bag
and
he
shook
it
a
little
and
squeezed
it,
and
then
sniffed
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
he
says,
i
squeezed
the
bag,
and
how...
the
way
you
usually
do
these
inspections,
yes,
when
you
squeeze
the
bag,
you
squeeze
them
very
hard,
yes,
okay,
so
it's
a
hard
squeeze,
and
i
guess
justice
scalia's
expected
you
to
say,
which
i
rather
did,
too,
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
generate
a
juris
prudence
of
hard
squeezes.
[laughter]
what
we
will
have
is
an
infinite
number
of
cases
trying
to
decide
whether
a
hard
squeeze
is
more
than
a
soft
squeeze,
is
more
than
medium
squeeze,
et
cetera.
now,
there
may
be
extremes,
of
course.
but
you
don't
say
that,
and
i'm
rather
curious
why.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
assume--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
bus
driver
alone
was
the
person
who
put
the
bags
in
the
compartment,
what
would
your
answer
then
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i've
given
you
the
hypothetical.
i'm
not
moving
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
this
hypothetical.
what's
the
answer
in
the
case
of
this
hypothetical?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
it
matter
whether
it's
only
the
bus
driver
who
can
touch
it,
or
a
fellow
passenger
who
can
touch
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
given
up...
on
your
theory,
you've
given
up
your
right
to
demand
privacy,
and
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
in
effect
can
share
in
what
the
fellow
passenger
can
do,
why
can't
he
share
in
what
the
bus
driver
can
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
effect
i
guess
you're
saying
that
the
general
expectations
of
what
will
happen,
and
by
whom
things
will
be
done,
matters.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
it
matters,
why
doesn't
it
matter
that
the
only
general
expectation
is
that
a
fellow
passenger
may
move
the
luggage
in
order
to
get
his
luggage
in?
that's
all
you
expect.
why
isn't
that
relevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
don't
expect
other
passengers
to
walk
through
the
bus
and
feel
my
luggage
gratuitously.
and
isn't
that
because
the
general
principle
of
law
is,
you
cannot
touch
another
person's
chattel
if
that
touching
is
going
to
cause
harm
to
the
owner?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
it
did
here.
