we
say
the
very
fact
that
you
may
have
a
law
enforcement
objective,
purpose
in
mind
as
opposed
to
a
private
one
doesn't
matter,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
a
lower
level
of
generality
the
purpose
for
which
you
may
engage
in
touching
may
very
well
matter.

so
you
think
the
traveling
public
has
no
reasonable
expectation
that
their
bags
will
be
left
untouched,
except
for
being
moved?
