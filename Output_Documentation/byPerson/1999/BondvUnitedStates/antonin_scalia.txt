justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
difference...
the
difference,
ms.
fuentes,
if
there
is
one,
i
mean,
the
difference
asserted,
is
whether
there's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
you
do
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
your
clothing.
you
don't
expect
somebody
to
come
up
and
frisk
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
your
opponents
will
say,
in
a
soft
bag
that
you
chuck
into
a...
you
know,
a
carrier
on
the
airplane.
you
know
that
other
passengers
can
go
there
and
feel
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
now,
how
can
that
be?
did
he
have
a
reasonable
expectation
other
passengers
would
not
be
able
to
feel
the
luggage
and
see
what
was
in
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
couldn't
have
squeezed
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
some
nasty
passengers
who
may
go
beyond
that.
let's
analogize
it
to
the
situation
where
you
leave
your
window
shades
up.
now,
you
don't
expect
your
neighbors
to
peek
into
your
room,
but
you
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
the
police
are
entitled
to
observe
what
is
going
on
in
the
room
if
you
leave
the
shades
up,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
may
be
a
nasty
thing
for
people
to
look
into
your
room.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
right
make
any...
why
does
the
right
make
any
difference?
i
mean,
let's
take
garbage
standing
at
the
curb.
there's
another
example
where
purpose
makes
no
difference.
do
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
your
trash?
we've
said
not,
because
anybody
going
by
can
paw
through
it.
now,
that's
not
a
nice
thing
to
do,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
somebody
paws
through
it
because
he's
a
busybody
or
whether
a
police
officer
paws
through
it.
now,
i
don't
see
why
there's
any
difference
in
this
pawing
over
the
luggage.
justice
antonin
scalia
anybody
could
do
it.
it
would
not
be
a
nice
thing
for
a
passenger
who
sees
a
nice
bag
there...
doesn't
need
the
room
to...
doesn't
need
to
move
it,
but
says,
i
wonder
what's
in
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
a
passenger
can
do
that.
that's
not
a
nice
thing
to
do.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
nice
thing
to
do.
it
can
be
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
a
person
has
a
right
to
say,
don't
paw
through
my
garbage?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
a
person
has
a
right
to
say,
don't
peek
into
my
windows?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
indeed,
there
are
some
laws
against
peeping
toms.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
peeping
toms,
and
when
you
leave
your
blinds
open,
you
know
you're
exposing
yourself
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
decide
these
cases
on
that
basis,
decide
in
each
case
what
degree
of
manipulabil...
manipulation
would
have
had
to
occur
to...
if
it
was
a
bigger
brick,
it
might
have
been...
i'm
very
unlikely
to
come
up
with
a
rule
like
that,
i'll
tell
you.
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
either
squeeze
the
bags
or
you
can't
squeeze
the
bags,
but
i
don't
think
we're
likely
to
make
it
depend
upon
how
much
you
squeezed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i'd
feel
more
sympathetic
to
your
client,
you
know,
from
this
terrible
intrusion
on
his
privacy
if
there
were
not
some
very
easy
way
to
avoid
it,
which
is
called
hard
luggage.
if
he's
really
concerned
about
the
privacy
of
the
contents
of
whatever
he's
carrying,
put
it
in
hard
luggage.
what's
the
big
deal?
justice
antonin
scalia
second
after
that
is
getting
a
hard
bag,
but
if
he
gets
a
soft
bag
he
knows
people
are
going
to
be
able
to
feel
things
through
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
your
fellow
passengers
can
sniff
your
luggage?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
okay.
you
don't
think
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
have
to
say
that
it
wouldn't,
because
we've
said
that
the
police
or
police
dogs
can
sniff
the
luggage,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh
huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
think
it
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy
if
you
saw
a
passenger
who
was
moving--
[laughter]
--you
know,
as
he's
moving
one
of
your
bags?
would
you
consider
that
invasion
of
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
i
would,
too,
but
you
know
it
can
happen,
and
you've
exposed
yourself
to
it
when
you
put
the
soft
luggage
up
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
as
you
expose
yourself
when
you
put
your
trash
out
in
containers
that
can
be
readily
opened
and
looked
into.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
want
us
to
go
into
the
degree
of
manipulation,
then,
you're
say.
we're
going
to
have
to
decide,
you
know,
whether
a
normal
member
of
the
traveling
public
would
have
manipulated
it
to
this
degree.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
okay,
suppose
i
say
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i...
if
my
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
it
would
not
have
been
discerned
simply
by
pushing
or
by
grabbing,
it
would
have
taken...
it
would
have
had
to
be
another
member
of
the
traveling
public
who
wanted
to
know
what
was
in
the
bag,
and
who
squeezed
it
to
figure
it
out,
you
say,
if
that's
the
case,
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
may
lose.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lamken--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
that
if
he
took
more
than
45
seconds
he
would
be
observing
things
that
other
polite
members
of
the
public
would
not
observe.
i
don't
understand
why
you
take
the
position
that
the
only
thing
you
expose
yourself
to
when
you
put
a
soft
piece
of
luggage
in
a
public
space
that
you
know
people
can
paw
through
is
pawing
through
by
other
polite
members
of
the
public.
why
isn't
the
case
that
he
exposed
that
to
somebody
else
who
could
readily
go
in
there
and
manipulate
the
bag
in
order
to
find
out
what
was
inside
of
it?
now,
i
agree
that
that's
not
a
polite
thing
to
do,
but
isn't
the
question
whether
he
really
expected
to
be
protected
from
that
kind
of
inquiry
when
he
put
it
in
a
public
place
in
a
soft
bag,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
are
a
lot
of
impolite
travelers
who
might
well
have
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
going
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
you're
going
to
come
out
with
an
opinion
that
says
so
long
as
you
don't
do,
you
know,
anything
more
than
what
a
polite
member
of
the
public
would
do,
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
going
to
help
you,
because
in
every
case
you're
going
to
have
to
get
into
this
inquiry
about,
was
it
45
seconds
or
50
seconds,
did
he
really
squeeze
it
hard,
or
squeeze
it
more
lightly.
i
don't
think
courts
are
able
to
manage
this
kind
of
a
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
access
to
it.
it's
the
bus
driver
who
pulls
it
out
and
puts
it
on
the
floor.
justice
antonin
scalia
outside
the
bus.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
theirs.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
takes
them
one
by
one.
he
looks
at
the
name,
he
says,
jones.
jones,
come
on
up
here.
[laughter]
this
is
a
slow
bus.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay--
--the
bus
driver's
a
bailee,
i
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
he
probably
has
some
responsibilities
as
a
bailee--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
to
feel
your
luggage.
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
the
impolite
passenger
does
not.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
the
fellow
passenger
intentionally
threw
it
the
ground
and
the
brick
fell
out,
the
fellow
passenger
would
be
liable
for
his
imprisonment?
