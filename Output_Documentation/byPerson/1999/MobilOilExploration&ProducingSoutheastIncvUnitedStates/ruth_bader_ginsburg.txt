--mr.
phillips--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
take
you
back
to
where
justice
stevens
was,
because
you
mentioned
very
quickly
that
there's
a
statute
in
this
picture,
the
czma,
and
as
far
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
are
not
in
any
way
suggesting
that
the
states
couldn't...
subject
to
the
override
of
the
secretary
of
commerce,
the
states
couldn't
say,
even
if
you
had
every
approval
from
interior
promptly,
the
state
could
still
say,
north
carolina
could
still
say,
no
go,
no
exploration.
we
think
you're
out
of
whack
with
our
coastal
management
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
he
didn't,
at
least
in
the
first
round.
the
secretary
of
commerce
did
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
there's
one
peculiar
feature
of
this
case
that
follows
on
to
your
answer
that
yes,
north
carolina
could
do
this
subject
to
the
override
of
the
secretary
of
commerce.
it's
almost
as
though
the
outer
banks
act
has
given
you
a
way
out
that
you
never
would
have
had
without
that
outer
banks
act.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
only
the
outer
continental
shelf
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
could
get
everything
you
wanted
from
interior
and
north
carolina
could
still
say
no.
it's
only
because
there
is
this
other
act
that
looks
like
it's
stopping
you
in
your
tracks
that
enables
you
to
repudiate,
that
enables
you
to
seek--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--restitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
had
nothing
but
the
outer
continental
shelf,
that
the
secretary,
who
was
on
the
verge
of
giving
approval
to
beginning
exploration,
on
the
verge
of
that
when
the
second
act
passed,
that
the
secretary
was
out
of
compliance
with
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
at
the
time
the
next
act
intervened?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just
a
question
perhaps
i
should
have
asked
mr.
jones.
it's
odd
that
the
interior
is
doing
everything,
and
at
the
end
of
the
line
of
the
czma
we
get
another
secretary
from
another
department
into
the
picture.
do
you
know
why
there
was
that
split
between
interior
and
commerce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
would
congress
assign
the
supervising
role,
the
control
role
to
interior
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
act,
and
then
under
the
czma
give
the
control
to
the
commerce
department?
