mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
contract
case
in
which
my
clients
have
paid
more
than
$156
million
for
the
right,
as
it
said
in...
at
pet.
app.
175a,
to
drill
for,
develop,
and
produce
oil
and
gas
resources
off
the
outer
banks
of
north
carolina.
later,
congress
intervened
in
the
outer
banks
protection
act
and
declared,
quote,
that
the
secretary...
and
this
at
page
161a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
the
secretary
of
interior
shall
not
conduct
a
lease
sale,
issue
any
new
leases,
approve
any
exploration
plan,
approve
any
development
and
production
plan,
approve
any
application
for
permit
to
drill,
or
permit
any
drilling,
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
13
months,
and
potentially
for
an
indefinite
period
thereafter.
congress
could
hardly
have
been
any
clearer
in
its
efforts
to
repudiate
the
basic
lease
obligations
that
the
united
states
had
undertaken
with
respect
to
the
mobil
and
marathon
leases
here.
indeed,
congress
specifically
identified
by
name
the
mobil
oil
corporation
in
the
context
of
this
particular
statute,
and
said
that
it
wanted
to
bring
this
lease
to
a
halt.
not
surprisingly,
it
had
exactly
that
effect.
not
only
did
the
government
categorically
repudiate
its
obligations
under
the
lease,
but
at
the
first
opportunity
in
august
of
1990,
when
mobil,
on
behalf
of
the
other
producers
in
the
manteo
unit,
submitted
a
plan
of
exploration,
and
sought
approval
to
go
forward
at
the
very
first
steps
under
this
lease,
what
the
united
states
did,
and
it
was
quite
clear
about
this,
was
it
said,
this
is
approvable
in
all
respects
under
the
outer
continental
shelf's
lands
act,
but
we
cannot
approve
it
because
of
the
outer
banks
protection
act.
we
are
prohibited
from
doing
so,
and
as
a
consequence
we
suspended
the
lease.
and
then
when
the
secretary
addressed
the
question
from
north
carolina
as
to
whether
or
not
the
plan
should
be
disapproved
or
otherwise
modified,
the
department
said
categorically,
we
cannot
do
that
because
it
is
approvable
in
all
respects
based
on
the
2,000-page
report
that
had
been
submitted
by
the
united
states
just
months
before
this
action
was
taken.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
certainly
had
the
power
to
suspend
the
lease
under
certain
conditions
in
section
5
of
the
lease
that
said
that
if
there
is
a
threat
of
irreparable
injury
to
the
environment,
irreparable
and
significant
injury,
there
was
certainly
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
but
of
course
there's
clearly,
1)
never
been
a
finding
by
the
secretary
of
interior
or
anyone
at
interior
along
those
lines
and,
indeed,
the
outer
banks
protection
act
itself
cannot
substitute
for
that
finding,
because
the
congress
in
the
outer
banks
protection
act
made
no
effort
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
serious
threat.
all
it
said
was
that
there
were
concerns
that
had
not
been
fully
allayed
even
though
this
was
in
the
face
of
a
2,000-page
report.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
part
of
that's
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--my
guess
is
that
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
if
they
had
made
the
specific
kinds
of
findings
that
are
provided
for
in
section
5,
they
could
bring
all
of
this
to
a
halt,
including
their
obligation
under
the
30-day
requirement,
but
of
course
prior
to
the
time--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
under
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--serious
harm,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
said
there
was
no
significant
risk
created
as
a
consequence
of
that,
and
while
the
government
has
made
the
effort
in
this
court
to
suggest
that
there's
no
materiality
in
this
context
because
the
outer
banks
protection
act
basically
supplies
the
findings
that
could
have
otherwise
been
supplied
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
it
is
absolutely
clear
to
me
that
that
cannot
be
the
case.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
first
of
all
does
have
a
set
of
timing
requirements
and
a
certain
specific
suspension
obligations
that
look
to
serious
threats
of
harm,
and
also
examines
these
things
on
the
basis
of
environmental
considerations.
the
outer
banks
protection
act,
in
stark
contrast,
first
of
all
has
no
timing
element
to
it.
once
you
get
into
the
studies
that
are
required
under
the
outer
banks
protection
act,
there
is
no
requirement
to
come
back
at
any
time
within
a
reasonable
period
and,
second
of
all,
the
question
of
environmental
concerns
is
completely
wiped
away
and,
third
of
all,
and
i
think
perhaps
in
some
ways
most
important,
there
is
a
socioeconomic
obligation
to
collect
information
with
respect
to
socioeconomic
effects
that
you
might
engage
in
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
by
this
exploration
and
production,
and
none
of
that
occurs
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
that's
strictly
a
function
of
the
new
amendments
under
the
outer
banks
protection
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
we
have
no...
there's
no
dispute
about
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
question
is,
given,
1)
that
congress
came
in
and
categorically
repudiated
all
of
its
obligations,
given
2)...
and
these
are
undisputed
facts...
given,
2)
that
the
secretary
refused
to
approve
a
poe
approvable
in
all
respects
and
second,
again,
subsequently
refused
to
approve
a
poe
even
though
it
was
in
full
compliance
with
the
outer
banks
protection
act,
so
there
is
substantial
nonperformance
in
the
face
of
a
repudiation.
hornbook
law
for
300
years
and
this
court's
decision
in
nash
v.
towne
makes
clear
that
under
those
circumstances
the
violating
party
is
not
free
to
keep
something
for
nothing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was...
one
aspect
of
that
was
raised
in
the
claims
court,
and
the
claims
court
i
think
viewed
it
as
sufficiently
insubstantial.
he
didn't
bother
to
address
it
specifically.
they
did
address
the
suspension,
our
exercise
of
our
rights
under
the
memorandum
of
understanding,
not
under
the
lease
but
under
the
memorandum
of
understanding,
to
suspend
these
leases
during
the
period
of
time
that
the
czma
objections
were
ongoing.
they
identified
that
in
the
claims
court
as
the
only
basis
for
waiver.
but
even
if
you
give
the
united
states
the
benefit
of
the
opportunity
to
put
waiver
on
the
table
at
this
stage,
based
on
our
filing
of
the
exploration
plan...
based
on
our
filing
an
appeal
of
the
czma
objection
and
then
based
on
the
suspensions,
as
a
matter
of
law
that
cannot
possibly
represent
an
intentional
relinquishment
of
our
rights
under
this
contract,
particularly
in
the
context
of
court
of
federal
claims
litigation,
where
you
have
no
right
to
seek
specific
performance.
you
have
no
right
to
seek
a
declaration
of
your
rights.
and
in
this
case
it's
even
worse
than
in
any
other
case,
because
the
united
states
could
with
all
credibility
argue
until
1996
that
they
had
never
breached
this
contract
because
of
the
unmistakability
doctrine
and
the
sovereign
acts
doctrine
that
this
court
had
not
repudiated
at
least
until
the
winstar
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
didn't
even
know
if
there
was
a
breach
of
this
contract--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
case
is
still
alive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
essentially
for
the
reasons
i
was
just
explaining
to
you,
justice
stevens.
since
we
didn't
know,
and
the
government
even
today
is
saying
there's
been
no
breach
of
contract,
and
we
have
no
mechanism
by
which
to
obtain
any
kind
of
an
assessment
of
what
our
rights
are.
all
we've
done
is
essentially
try
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
act
reasonably
in
response
to
the
government's
repudiation
of
our
rights.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
at
that
point
we
would
be
able
to
go
to
the
plan
of
exploration,
but
we
would
still
have...
well,
at
this
stage
now
the
outer
banks
protection
act
has
been
repealed,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--assuming
the
outer
banks
protection
act
was
still
in
place,
we
would
still
have
the
same
objection.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
in
reality,
and
if
you're
asking
for
a
practical
answer
as
opposed
to
a
theoretical
answer,
as
a
practical
answer,
no,
because
all
of
the
other
leases
surrounding
us
have
all
been
turned
in
because
all
of
the
other
leasehold
owners
had
caved
years
ago,
rather
than
try
to
litigate
this
matter,
so
that
the
manteo
unit
no
longer
exists
as
a
unit.
it's
all...
all
of
its
participants
have
walked
away
from
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
would
have
the
legal
right
now
to
have
the
secretary
approve
our
plan
of
exploration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
would
have
to
get...
we
would
still
have
to
get
permits,
and
we
would
have
to
go
through
all
of
the
approvals
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
that's
true.
we
try
to
preserve
the
opportunity
to
retain
our
relationship
with
our
contracting
partner
in
this
context,
that
is,
the
united
states,
as
a
consequence
of
this,
given
that
there's
no
mechanism
for
specific
performance
and
no...
or
declaratory
relief.
all
we
could
do
is
basically
try
to
preserve
as
much
of
the
status
quo
ante
as
we
could,
while
at
the
same
time
being
as
clear
as
humanly
possible
that
what
we
really
wanted
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
repudiation,
seek
restitution,
and
be
out...
and
be
done
with
this
particular--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
exactly
our
position,
that
in
the
ordinary
course
it's
an
election
of
remedies
issue
which
comes
much
later
in
the
process.
we
didn't...
and
all
we
did
was
to
try
to
preserve
our
ability
to
have
an
election
of
remedies
at
the
appropriate
time,
and
if
we
have
to
elect
them
today,
i'd
take
the
$156
million,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
mean...
and
i
mean,
it's
subject
to
that
last
statement,
of
course,
that
they
would
have...
there
would
have
to
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
in
fact
saying
that
there's
an
inconsistency
with
the
coastal
zone
management
act.
but
yes,
subject
to
that,
the
only
ability
to
go
forward
under
those
circumstances
would
be
to
go
to
the
secretary
of
interior,
or
of
commerce,
excuse
me,
and
seek
to
have
the
objection
overridden
and,
indeed,
in
the
dozen
cases
between
1984
and
1994
in
which
that
course
has
been
followed,
the
secretary
in
fact
did
overturn
state
objections
under
the
czma.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
did
not
in
1994,
however.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
seek
restitution.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
that
may
be
true,
because
that
is
exactly
what
restitution
seeks
to
accomplish,
which
is
to
acknowledge
or
recognize
that
in
certain
circumstances
events
may
work
to
the
fortuity
of
the
innocent
party
in
a
way
that
allows
them
to
seek
restitution
where...
even
though
it's
a
losing
contract.
i
mean,
that
is
the
basis
of
the
restatement
373
illustration.
one
says
that
if
you
pay
$20,000
to
buy
land,
and
the
land's
value
drops
to
nothing,
and
the
other
side
still
doesn't,
for
whatever
reason,
give
you
the
property,
you
are
still
entitled
to
the
$20,000.
the
other
side
doesn't
get
something
for
nothing
under
those
circumstances,
so
you
can
classify
it
as
a
fortuity,
but
it
is
right
at
the
core
of
what
300
years
of
restitution
law
is
designed
to
allow
us
to
do.
the
second
part
of
this,
though
is,
you
know,
the
expectations
of
the
party
at
that
point
in
time,
in
1982,
was
that
this
was
going
to
go
through
quite
cleanly,
and
the
evidence
of
that
is
pretty
clear.
first
of
all,
the
first
two
requests
for
exploration
plans
were
both
approved
by
the
secretary
and
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
with
no
objection
at
that
point
in
time,
and
what...
of
course,
it
took
us
a
while
to
develop
the
kind
of
environmental
evidence
we
would
need
in
order
to
put
together
this
kind
of
a
novel
arrangement
in
this
particular
setting,
and
so
time
certainly
ran
through,
but
our
expectations
all
along
were
that
we
would
be
in
fact
able
to
drill.
i
mean,
that's
what
my
clients
are
in
the
business
of
doing.
they're
not
in
the
business
of
generating
litigation.
they're
in
the
business
of
generating
oil
and
natural
gas,
while
at
this
stage
i
think
they're
quite
content
to
walk
away
and
try
to
get
back
the
money
the
government
took
for
doing
nothing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
would
have
preferred
to
be
able
to
drill.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
sure
if
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
not
sure
it's
so
much
in
the
subsequent
court
action.
i
think
if
the
poe
had
been
approved
and
the
state
had
objected
to
the
plan
of
development
at
that
point
in
time,
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
very
substantial
argument
for
going
to
the
secretary
of
interior
and
asking
the
secretary
to
set
it
aside
as
overbalanced,
instead
of
getting
into
the
outer
banks
protection
act
problem
of
saying,
well,
what
we
don't
have
is
enough
information,
and
we
don't
have
enough
information
about
the
environment,
we
don't
have
enough
information
about
bottom
blowers--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
i
think
there's
no
question
that
we
would
have
had
an
opportunity...
our
working
assuming
in
1982,
when
we
entered
into
this
agreement,
was,
we
would
get
our
approvals...
remember,
in
1982
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
had
been
in
effect
for
almost
30
years.
the
secretary
had
never
disapproved
a
plan
of
exploration,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that.
that
was
the
basis,
that's
the
essence
of
the
bargain.
it's
not,
were
we
ever
going
to
ultimately
get
oil
in
this
case.
the
essence
of
the
bargain
was,
were
we
going
to
get
performance
by
the
united
states
government?
that
is,
was
it
going
to
apply
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
legal
standards
embodied
in
there
and
allow
us
to
move
forward
under
those
circumstances?
if
they
had
followed
that
course,
we
would
be
now
drilling
hopefully
for
6
trillion
cubic
foot
of
natural
gas.
they
didn't
follow
that
course.
they
repudiated,
they
materially
breached,
and
the
appropriate
course
of
action
for
the
court
to
follow
at
this
stage
is
restitution.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'd
waive
the
balance...
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
try
not
to
use
all
of
those
13
minutes.
the
government's
position
here
is
a
fairly
astonishing
one
in
now
suggesting
that
we
have
not
complied
with
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
prior
to
the
time
of
the
outer
banks
protection
act.
the
reason
that's
astonishing
is,
first
of
all,
the
officials
involved
at
the
time
said
we
were
in
full
compliance
with
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
the
united
states
government,
in
the
court
of...
in
the
federal
circuit
at
page
39
of
their
brief
said,
if
there
had
never
been
an
obpa
in
1990,
plaintiffs
ostensibly
would
have
received
approval
of
their
exploration
plan
within
30
days.
to
come
here
today
and
say,
well,
in
order
to
save
this
case
we've
got
to
take
the
findings
of
the
obpa
and...
take
those
round
findings
and
stuff
them
into
the
square
pegs
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
suggests
to
me
just
a
sense
of
desperation.
the
truth
is,
the
government
has
never
made...
the
right
party
has
never
made
the
right
findings
that
would
justify
not
going
forward
with
respect
to
the
lease.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
might,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
no,
it
wasn't
quoted
in
the
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
it's
subject
essentially,
i
think,
to
three
answers.
first
of
all,
under
the
lease
we
didn't
buy
into
the
idea
that
the
outer
banks
protection
act
or
congress
or
any
other
action
by
congress
could
come
in
and
substitute
for
the
secretary,
and
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
north
american
case
that
they
rely
on,
because
that
case
said
specifically
that
the
question
of
how
many
seals
you
could
kill
is
completely
subject--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
future
statutory
change
and
regulation
change.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
part
because
the
definition...
and
we,
of
course,
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
brief
what
it
means
to
be
in
the
human
environment,
but
recall
finding
number
3
is
tourism.
it's
not
an
environmental
provision
at
all.
it
talks
about
injury
to
tourism,
which
they
now
try
to
tie
in
oral
argument
on
the
fly
to
the
notion
that
somehow
there's
an
environmental
impact
here.
i
think
it
actually
makes
my
point,
which
is
that
the
outer
banks
protection
act
takes
you
out
of
the
kinds
of
environmental
concerns
that
were
the
core
of
what
we
entered
into
with
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
and
has
added
this
entire
socioeconomic
set
of
analyses
that
never
had
to
exist
before,
and
i
think
that
finding
is
specifically
embraced
within
it
and
completely
beyond
anything
that
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
would
have
provided
for.
so
it's
the
wrong...
again,
it's
the
wrong
entity
making
the
wrong
findings,
under
circumstances
that
completely
violate
our
agreement.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
timing
of
this
and
the
notion
of
whether
time
was
of
the
essence,
i
would
simply
note
that
in
our
memorandum
of
understanding
that
was
entered
into
as
part
of
the
process
in
1989,
all
three
of
the
parties,
the
state,
the
secretary,
and
the
producers,
specifically
found
at
joint
appendix
84
that
time
was
of
the
essence
by
that
point
in
this
process,
so
that,
frankly,
is
not
an
argument,
even
though
i
do
think,
justice
scalia,
you're
right,
is
that
time
is
the
essence.
there's
got
to
be
at
least
some
reasonableness
requirement
that
gets
imposed.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
again,
it
seems
to
me
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
simple
question
of
when
are
you
entitled
to
restitution
to
get
something
for
nothing.
justice
souter
made
it
as
plain
as
possible.
there
was
no
performance
by
the
united
states.
to
the
extent
that
there
were
studies
that
were
done,
they
were
done
to
comply
with
its
obligations
under
the
outer
banks
protection
act.
the
need
to
get
clear
on
this
is
today,
and
i
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
it's
not
uncommon
in
some
of
these
cases
to
have
interior
and
commerce
disagree
about
the
right
way
to
proceed.
i
mean,
they
are
answering
slightly
different
questions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
theory
there
is
that
there
may
be
instances
in
which
the
secretary
of
interior
might
be
too
wedded
to
environmental
concerns,
and
that
there
are
other
commercial
issues
that
are
of
greater
importance,
and
in
the
appropriate
balance...
which
is
what
he's
supposed
to
do,
because
he's
supposed
to
analyze
it
independently--
