h.
souter
and
contrary
to
that
they
had
a
2,000-page
report
that
said
there
wasn't
one,
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
his
argument
is
that
you've
never
determined
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
isn't
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
it
the
case,
though,
that
the
lease,
which
in
effect
is
the
contract
between
you,
was
referring
to
what
the...
was
referring
to
contingencies
that
could
occur
under
the
law
and
under
the
regulations
as
they
stood
at
the
time
the
lease
was
passed,
and
quite
apart
from
the
chief
justice's
objection,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
your
argument
is
that
this
issue
was
raised
by
subsequent
congressional
action,
and
if
it
was
raised
by
subsequent
congressional
action,
it's
irrelevant,
as
a
point
in
your
favor,
in
construing
the
lease.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
all
of
the
studies
and
the
further
inquiries
were
being
made
under
the
outer
banks
act,
and
the
two
oil
companies
have
gotten
in
the
record
the
letter,
as
i
recall,
addressed
to
the
governor
of
the
state
saying
everything's
fine
with
respect
to
the
law
except,
i
may
not
give
an
approval
as
a
result
of
the
outer
banks
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
does
not
bind
the
government--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it
was
unauthorized?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
not...
in
other
words,
the
government--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
was
not
the
government's
position,
in
other
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
may
not
consider
that
letter
even
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether,
under
the
law
and
regs
as
they
stood
at
the
time
of
the
lease,
there
was
any
basis
for
the
government
to
refuse
to
approve
the
poe.
we
cannot
consider
it
even
for
that
purpose,
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
start
again.
my
basic
premise
is
that
what
the
government
is
authorized
to
do
under
the
lease
depends
on
the
terms
of
the
lease
and,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
reference
to
statutes
or
regs,
it
refers
to
statutes
or
regs
at
the
time
the
lease
was
signed.
the
letter
that
we're
referring
to
appears
to
be
a
statement
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
so
far
as
the
lease,
statutes,
and
regs
at
the
time
of
the
lease
are
concerned,
there
is
no
basis
for
the
government
not
to
approve
the
poe.
it
is
nonetheless
not
approving
the
poe
because
of
obligations
upon
it
under
the
outer
banks
act
which
was
subsequently
passed.
my
question
is,
may
we
consider
the
letter
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
that
that
was
the
government's
position
when
the
letter
was
sent?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
it
may
not
be
considered
as
evidence
for
any
purpose.
i
guess
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure
it
can,
but
it
can't
amend
the
terms
of
the
lease.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
i...
no,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what
you're
describing
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
--imperfect
performance
as
i
understand
it
is
the
suspension
of
the
lease
payment.
as
i...
mobil
says,
please
stop
charging
me
money
for
giving
me
nothing,
and
that's
what
you're
characterizing
as
performance
of
the
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
got
a
rent-free
extension
for
nothing.
it
got
nothing
out
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
do
what
it
had
to
do--
justice
david
h.
souter
--presumably
to
perform
its
side
of
the
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
it
never
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
every
frustration
case
it's
going
to
be
an
answer
to
rescission
to
say,
gee,
i
tried.
i
can't
give
you
a
thing.
i
can't
perform
one
iota
of
what
i
agreed
to,
but
i
tried.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
a
benefit
to--
