mr.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
one
question?
the
facts
are
a
little
complex
here.
there's
another
lawsuit
that's
been
pending
and
stayed,
as
i
understand
it,
in
which
you're
challenging
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
not
to
override
the
state's
objections.
is
that
case
still
alive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
the
thing
i
want
you
to
explain
to
me,
and
i'm
sure
you
have
an
answer
to
this,
if
you
filed
that
case
seeking
to
protect
your
rights
under
the
whole
program,
and
if
that's
still
pending,
how
can
you
simultaneously
say
that
the
whole
deal
is
off?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
if...
say
you
lost
this
case,
just
hypothetically,
but
yet,
then
you
went
ahead
with
the
other
case
and
you
won
that
case,
would
you
then
not
be
able
to
develop
the
leases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
guess
the
ultimate
question
i'm
trying
to
ask,
is
it
not
conceivable
that
you
could
lose
this
case
and
still
develop
the
properties
by
winning
that
case
and
get
your
approvals
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
have
the
legal
right
to
develop
it
if
you
won
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
approved
it,
then
you'd
have
the
legal
right
to
go
out
and
drill
the
wells.
maybe
you
can't
do
it
because
of
changed
circumstances.
