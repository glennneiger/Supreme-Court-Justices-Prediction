but
those
findings
are
environmental
findings?
justice
antonin

serious
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
okay.
they
just
want
their
money
back.
i
mean,
they're
perfectly
willing
to
protect
the
environment
and
call
the
deal
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
they
get
their
money
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
need
to
make
further
investigation
does
not
equate
with
a
finding
of
immediate
or
serious
danger.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you
have
to
get
to,
and
i
keep
listening
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
that
finding
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
subject
to.
what
is
subject
to?
does
that
mean
an
immediate
threat?
it
says,
is
subject
to
potentially
significant--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
mean,
you
know,
true,
time
is
normally
not
of
the
essence,
but
that
phrase
means,
you
know,
if
you're
1-minute
late
it's
no
big
deal.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
perform
at
an
unreasonably
late
time
and
it's
okay,
unless
you've
said
you
have
to
perform
within
a
reasonable
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
reasonable
time
is
of
the
essence,
and
if
you
have
not
approved
these
operations
within
the
reasonable
time
that
the
contract
envisioned,
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
breach
of
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
--known
that
congress
is
going
to
pass
a
new
statute
making
a
finding
that
under
the
contract
is
supposed
to
be
made
by
an
executive
official
which
could
be
reviewed
by
a
court,
as
i
assume
a
congressional
finding
cannot
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
you're
essentially
saying
that
these
savvy
businessmen
bought
a
commitment
from
the
government
that
was
dependent
upon
not
just
a
finding
by
some
expert
board,
or
by
some
secretary,
but
that
was
ultimately
dependent
upon
whatever
finding
congress...
that,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
scientifically
precise
body--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
likely
to
make
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
crazy
contract--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
really
said,
so
long
as
congress
thinks
further
study
should
be
done,
further
studies
will
be
done,
and
that's
what
we're
buying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
not
aware
of
the
principle
of
contract
law
you're
appealing
to.
if
i
have
a
contract
with
someone
that
requires
performance
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
he
does
not
perform,
i
cannot
press
that
person
to
perform--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
period
of
a
year,
for
a
period
of
2
years,
and
finally
say,
look,
this
is
just
useless,
i
want
out
of
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
performance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
quid
pro
quo?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
pay
you
money,
in
exchange
for
which
you
will
do
an
environmental
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
performance
under
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
performance
by
the
united
states
is
giving
them
permission
to
drill.
that
was
the
quid
pro
quo--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ultimately,
that
they
were
seeking,
certainly
not--
