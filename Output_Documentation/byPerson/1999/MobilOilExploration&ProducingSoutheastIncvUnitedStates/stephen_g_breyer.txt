justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
may
not
understand
this.
i'm
stopping
you
because
i
want
it
clarified.
i
thought
to
suspend
a
lease
is
a
technical
activity.
the
suspension
of
a
lease
means
that
the
companies
need
not
pay
a
series
of
payments.
the
suspension
of
the
lease
does
not
mean
that
they
suddenly
do
not
have
a
time-related
obligation
in
the
government
to
approve
or
to
disapprove
by
a
czma
the
plan
of
exploration.
now,
am
i
right
about
that,
or
not?
i
mean,
you
are
suspending
the
lease.
what
you're
complaining
about
is
not...
you're
complaining
about
the
fact
that
they
did
not
within
a
specified
time
either
approve
or
disapprove
that
plan,
and
you
believe,
and
they
don't
contest
it,
they
would
have
had
to
approve
it
under
czma.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
the
suspension
of
the
lease...
did
they
have
a
right
under
this
reg?
this
is
hitting
me
cold
suddenly.
i
mean,
did
they
have
a
right
under
the
reg
to
suspend
the
lease,
not
in
just
the
sense,
no
payment,
but
in
the
sense
that
we
can
suspend
the
plan
of
exploration
approval?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
have
that
in
your
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is,
what
i
have
in
my...
in
the
statute
is
that
it
says,
regulation...
and
here
i
gather
there
was
no
regulation.
the
regulation
prescribed
by
the
secretary
allows
the
suspension--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
there
is,
and
these
are
the
key
words,
a
threat
of
serious,
irreparable,
or
immediate
harm
to
the
environment,
among
other
things.
then
i
looked
at
the
best
finding
that
you
can
find
as
a
substitute,
and
you
cannot
find
a
regulation
because
there
is
no
such
regulation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
there
is
no
regulation
by
the
secretary
that
says
that,
or
that
provides
for...
that
makes
that
finding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
not
that
has
a
finding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
don't
you
say...
let
me
pose
a
question,
though
i
may
not
do
it
perfectly,
then
you'll
see
what...
i
thought
the
statute
says
there
has
to
be
a
regulation,
and
it
says
if
there
is
a
threat
of
serious,
irreparable
or
immediate
harm.
then
i
look
to
what
you
say
in
your
brief
about
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
best
you
can
do
is
a
finding
by
the
conference
committee
of
the
congress
which
says
that,
quote,
it
is
a
reasonable
action
to
prevent
a
public
harm
that
could
result
from
lack
of
such
information,
and
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
question
is,
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
a
finding
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
thing
to
do
to
have
the
suspension.
there
is
a
finding
that
there
is
a
serious
threat,
a
threat
of
serious,
irreparable
or
immediate
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
tell
me
where
you
discuss
that
in
your
brief,
because
i
didn't...
i
didn't
really
have
that
one.
when
i
looked
at
the
brief
what
i
had
is
on
page
32,
where
you
discuss
the
finding
of
the
conference
report,
and
now
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--totally
not
up
to
speed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
what
you
just
read
me.
can
you
just
tell
me
where
in
your
brief
you
discuss
that
finding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that...
if
that
finding
is
so
obvious,
then
why
didn't
you
discuss
it
in
your
brief?
i
mean,
if
that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
just
give...
all
right,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--cite.
let
me
just
write
it
down,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
finding
of
congress
that
you
think
was
equivalent
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
threat
of
serious,
irreparable
or
immediate
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
say
that
was
a...
just
one
of
a
thousand
issues.
i'd
say
that's
your
basic
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
take
it
that
it's
also...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
you
did,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
key
point
i
think,
if
i'm
right,
is
that
was
there
a
finding
of
a
threat
of
serious,
irreparable,
or
immediate
harm,
and
now
we're
back
where
we
started,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
it
buy?
what
was
mobile
buying
if
they
weren't
at
least
buying
a
promise
from
the
government
that
they'd
get
an
exploration
permit?
they
might
not
ever
be
able
to
drill,
but
at
least
we
get
our
exploration
permit
if
we
comply
with
ocsla,
or
czma,
or
whatever
they
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well
now,
what
else
could
they
have
been
buying,
because
in
these
things
i'd
imagine
they
think
they're
never
going
to
be
able
to
drill--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
we'll
take
a
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no...
oh,
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--obviously,
if
that's
so
you're
going
to
win
on
those
grounds,
et
cetera,
if
all
that's
relevant.
i'm
addressing
only
the
point
of
materiality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
say
on
that
question,
what
are
they
buying
if
they're
not
at
least
buying
a
promise
that,
look
at
this
law.
it
says
we
give
you
your
permission
within
30
days.
you
might
never
drill
exploratory
wells,
et
cetera,
but
at
least
you
get
a
certificate
from
us
within
30
days
if
you
comply
and...
you
know,
et
cetera.
and
now,
assuming
that
they
complied
with
that
act,
that
preexisting
act,
didn't
they
at
least
buy
that
promise?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
buy
the
promise?
you
could
follow
this
far.
did
they
buy
the
promise
that,
if
you
comply
with
the
preexisting,
whatever
those
were
there,
you
get
the
poe?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
i
take
it
his
argument,
which
i
really
didn't
understand
till
i
heard
it...
now
i
think
his
argument...
i
don't
blame
him
for
this,
but
i
think
his
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
following.
he
says,
look
at
that
finding.
that
finding
3
is,
the
major
industry
in
north
carolina,
tourism,
is
subject
to
potentially
significant
disruption,
all
right,
by
oil
and
gas
development.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
look
at
the
reg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
the
reg
says
is
that
there
shall
be...
the
regulations
shall
provide
for
suspension
if
there
is
a
threat
of
serious
harm
to
the
environment.
so
he
says,
how
can
you
look
at
that
finding
without
seeing
it
as
a
finding
of
a
threat,
and
a
serious
one,
and
really
what
you
have
to
look
at
obpa
as
is
telling
the
secretary,
suspend
the
leases
and
use
whatever
regulatory
authority
you
have
to
do
it.
so
that,
i
think,
is
basically
his
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
not
a...
that's...
i
grant
you
that
reg
wasn't
quoted
in
the
brief,
i
don't
think,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
anyway,
that's
his
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
whatever
about
the
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--whatever
about
the
case...
whatever
the
case
said,
why
isn't
this
a
finding...
maybe
it
was
in
the
brief,
too.
i
don't
know...
a
finding
that
there
is
a
threat
of
serious
harm
to
the
north
carolina
environment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
1981,
two
oil
companies
paid
the
government
$156
million
upfront
for
lease
contracts
that
gave
them
the
right
to
explore
for
offshore
oil,
but
only
if
various
government
departments
following
certain
standards
and
deadlines
that
were
all
referenced
in
the
contract
only
if
those
government
departments
approve
the
exploration
and
drilling
plans.
then
congress,
later
passed
specific
legislation
that
changed
those
referenced
deadlines
and
standards
making
it
more
difficult
for
the
companies
to
obtain
the
necessary
approvals
that
the
contract
said
were
required.
so
the
companies
then
asked
for
their
money
back.
they
sued
for
restitution.
the
court
of
claims
said
that
the
crossed
referenced
deadlines
and
standards
were
essential
parts
of
the
contract;
they
asked
but
what
else
did
the
companies
buy
for
$156
million
and
the
united
states,
it
added,
by
changing
those
deadlines
and
standards
in
a
significant
way
repudiated
the
contracts
and
it
had
to
give
the
companies
their
money
back.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
it
thought
that
the
deadline
changes
didn’t
hurt
the
companies
because
they
would
not
have
gotten
the
necessary
approval
anyway.
well,
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
that
whether
the
companies
would
or
would
not
have
gotten
the
necessary
approvals
anyways
beside
the
point,
the
companies
aren’t
asking
for
damages,
they
just
want
their
money
back.
if
a
lottery
operator
fails
to
give
you
a
ticket
that
you
buy,
you
get
your
money
back
even
though
you
never
would
have
won
the
lottery.
the
operator
didn’t
give
you
your
chance
of
winning
that
you
paid
for
and
that’s
true
irrespective
of
whether
that
chance
would
eventually
have
led
to
a
win.
the
same
is
true
here,
the
statutory
changes
in
the
deadlines
were
important
to
the
companies.
they
amounted
to
years
of
the
additional
delay
and
in
those
circumstances
the
government
is
insisting
upon
the
contrary
to
contract
changes,
however
justified
that
statute
may
have
been
as
a
matter
of
policy,
amounted
to
a
repudiation
of
the
government’s
basic
contract
with
the
companies.
they
didn’t
waive
their
rights
in
our
view
and
elementary
principles
of
the
contract
law
and
restitution
law
therefore
say
that
the
government
has
to
give
them
the
money
back
that
they
put
upfront.
we
all
explained
this
at
greater
length
in
our
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
