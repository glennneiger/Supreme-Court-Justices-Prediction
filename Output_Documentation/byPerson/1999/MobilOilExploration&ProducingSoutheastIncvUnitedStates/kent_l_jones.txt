mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
page
118
of
the
joint
appendix,
mobil
tells
us
that
the
leases
involved
in
this
case
encompass
what
may
be
the
largest
hydrocarbon
deposit
discovered
in
the
united
states
since
the
prudhoe
bay
field
in
alaska
in
the
1960's.
at
the
same
time,
the
tract
of
land
on
which
these
leases
are
located,
the
point
of
the
outer
banks
off
of
north
carolina,
is
unquestionably
one
of
the
most
unique
and
important
environmental
resources
on
the
eastern
seaboard.
in
this
context,
it
is
perfectly
understandable
that
it
is
a
matter
of
high
importance
to
north
carolina
and
to
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
this
enormous
hydrocarbon
resource
could
be
developed
without
causing
undue
harm
to
the
environment,
and
the
statutes
under
which
the
leases
are
issued
and
to
which
they
are
subject
is
highly
protective
of
these
important
environmental
interests.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that
is
an
issue
before
us,
and
under
the
leases,
under
the
terms
of
the
leases
that
are
applicable
to
us
as
well
as
to
the
lessee,
the
united
states
has
the
absolute
right
to
suspend
all
operations
on
the
lease,
including
consideration
of
these
kinds
of
exploration
plans,
whenever
the
united
states
determines
that
there
is
a
threatened
harm
to
the
environment,
or
that
economic...
i'm
sorry,
environmental
studies--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
no...
i'm
sorry,
but
i
disagree
with
both
of
those.
in
1990,
when
congress
enacted
the
obpa,
congress
determined
that
there
were
threats
of
environmental
harm--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
mean
a
finding
by
the
secretary.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
is
a
regulation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
is
a
regulation
that
says
we
can
suspend
whenever...
to
do
an
environmental
study,
or
to
investigate
threatened
environmental
harms.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
what
the
regulation
says.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
the
obpa,
what
congress
found
in
enacting
the
obpa
was
that
there
were
both
threatened
environmental
harms--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
you--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
if
you
look
at
pages
159
and
160
of
the
petition
appendix
in
the
marathon
petition,
where
the
obpa
findings
are
set
out,
one
of
those
findings
is
item
number--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they're
part
of
the
outer
banks
protection
act.
these
are
the
findings
that
were
part
of
that
act,
and
the
third
finding
under
(a),
6003(a)(3)
is
that
a
major--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--159a
of
the
marathon
petition.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
159a.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
petition
number
is
99-253.
it's
the
marathon
petition.
in
any
event,
the
third
finding
of
congress
was
that
a
major
industry
in
coastal
north
carolina
is
subject
to
potentially
serious...
significant
disruption
by
off-shore
gas
development.
now,
this
really
goes
to
the
heart--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is,
because
what
the
statute...
and
that's
the
confusion
that
i
need
to
clear
up.
this
is
very
important.
the
statute
says
that
if
there
is
a
threat
of
a
harm
to
the
marine
coastal
or
human
environment,
then...
then
the
lease
may
be
suspended.
the
statute
in
1334(i),
which
is
also
in
the
same
appendix
at
page
102a,
defines
the
term,
human
environment
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute
to
include...
and
i'll
paraphrase...
adverse
effects
on
the
local
economy.
this
is
an
unusual--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--environmental
determination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
page
102a
of
the
marathon
petition--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--appendix,
at
the
bottom,
item--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--human
environment.
in
enacting
the
ocsla
congress
did
something
a
little
different
than
it
has
in
normal
environmental
statutes.
it
has
put
into
the
statute
a
requirement
that
the
secretary
review
and
analyze
threatened
harms
to
the...
if
you'll
allow
me
to
paraphrase,
the
local
economy,
and
how
that
affects
people
who
live
in
the
coastal
environment,
and
that
gets
us
to
one
of
the
hearts
of
what
congress
was
concerned
about
in
the
obpa,
because
the
national
research
council
had
told
congress
that
the
mms
had
failed
to
look
at
this
issue.
the
environmental
study
panel
that
congress
put
together
under
the
obpa
concluded
that
the
mms
had
failed
to
look
at
this
issue.
it
needed
to
be
addressed.
and
secretary
lujan
2
years
into
his...
after...
on
completion
of
his
review
that
congress
required
also
concluded
that
the
mms
needed
to
make
further
investigation
of
this
issue
by
ordering
the
two
studies
that
mobil
wants
to
dismiss
as
socioeconomic
studies.
these
are
studies--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
there
was
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--immediate
or
serious.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
immediate
or
serious,
and
one
of...
and
what
i
quoted
to
you
from
the
findings
of
the
obpa
says
that
a
major
industry
is
subject
to
potentially
significant
disruption.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
only--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
can't...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
discussed
that
finding
in
the
brief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
had
enough
pages
to
discuss
every
possible
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
mean,
that's
an
honest
answer,
because
i
can
tell
you
from
working
on
this
brief,
there
were
a
lot
of
issues
that
had
to
be
narrowly
dealt
with
in
an
abbreviated
fashion,
and
perhaps
unfortunately
this
was
one,
but
the
point
is
that
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--cite
to
which?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
there's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
was...
again,
i
quoted
from
it
at
page
159a
of
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
it's
a
threatened
harm.
that's
all
that's
required,
and
that's
also
important.
all
that's
required
for
a
suspension
is
that
there
be
a
threat
of
harm,
and
then
we're
supposed
to
investigate,
and
if
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i...
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--from
my
perspective,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
is
authoritative
congressional
language
that
directs
the
secretary
of
interior
to
conduct
a
review
to
determine
whether
he
is
capable--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
other
law
that
applies
is
simply
a
regulation
that
says
we
can
conduct...
we
can
suspend
a
lease
whenever
we
need
to
perform
an
environmental
study.
that's
what
the
applicable
law
is.
we
can
suspend
the
lease
to
perform
an
environmental
study.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
what
congress
directed
the
secretary
to
do.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
issue,
the
effect
of
development
on
the
human
environment,
was
in
the
statute,
ocsla.
it's
in
section
1334(i)
of
the
ocsla,
and
i'm
quoting
a
statutory
provision
that
preceded
the
adoption...
the
enactment...
i'm
sorry,
any
of
this.
i
mean,
this
goes
back
to
the
1970's.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
letter
to
which
you're
referring
was
not
written
to
mobil.
it
was
written
to
a
governor
of
north
carolina.
it
was
written
by
a
regional
supervisor.
at
the
time
that
that
letter
was
written,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
the
responsibility
to
make
these
determinations,
not
the
regional
supervisor.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
saying
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it's
not
binding.
it's
certainly
not
binding,
because--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--congress
had
already--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--certainly
not.
congress
had
already
enacted
the
obpa
and
determined
that
additional
environmental
analyses
needed
to
be
performed
because
of
threatened
harms,
not
only
the
one
that
we
have
already
discussed--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
frankly
don't
understand
exactly
what
your
question
is,
but
i
will--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
was
not
the
government's
position.
that
was
a...
again,
that
was
not
a
formal
communication
to
mobil.
that
was
a
piece
of
correspondence
from
a
regional
supervisor
to
another
interested
party.
the
government--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--certainly
not...
it
is
certainly
incorrect.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
the
document...
the
exploration
plan
was
not
approvable
because
congress,
and,
we
believe,
within
its
authority,
had
directed
the
secretary
of
interior
to
conduct
an
appropriate
environmental
investigation
to
analyze
the
environmental
harms
that
the
mms
had
not
sufficiently
evaluated.
i
mean,
frankly,
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
going
on
here
is
a
question
of
who's
in
charge.
can
congress
tell
the
secretary
of
the
interior
how
to
perform
his
responsibilities
under
this
statute?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
it
can't,
and
it
didn't
purport
to.
what
congress
did
in
this
case
is
exactly
like
what
happened
in
1898
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
north
american
commercial
company
case.
now,
in
that
case
there
was
also
a
federal
lease.
the
federal
lease
allowed
the
lessee
to
take
60,000
seals
a
year
in
alaska,
or
such
lesser
number
as
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
determined
was
appropriate
to
protect
the
species.
the
united
states,
2
years
into
that
treaty,
after
having
allowed
60,000
seals
a
year
to
be
taken,
made
a
treaty,
which
to
protect
the
species
limited
the
number
of
seals
taken
to
7,500.
the
lessee
sued
saying
that
the
united
states
can't
tell
the
secretary
of
the
treasury...
i'm
sorry.
i
may
have
said
that
wrong.
it
was
the
secretary
of
treasury
who
was
supposed
to
make
the
decision
there...
can't
tell
him
how
to
exercise
his
discretion,
and
this
court
said
that...
it
rejected
that
claim
and
found
there
was
no
breach,
and
the
reason
applies
directly
here.
the
court
said,
the
united
states
is
the
lessee,
is
the
lessor.
the
united
states
is
the
party
to
this
contract,
not
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
the
secretary
is
merely
the
agent
of
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states,
as
the
real
party
at
interest
under
these
leases,
can
direct
its
agent,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
interior,
to
perform
an
act
that
is
within
the
rights
of
the
government
under
the
lease.
now,
it
was
plainly
within
the
rights
of
the
government
under
the
lease
to
suspend
the
lease
performance
to
conduct
these
environmental
investigations.
it
should
be
common
ground
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
that
authority,
and
because
the
secretary
had
that
authority
under
the
lease,
the
united
states,
as
the
real
party
at
interest,
could
direct
him
to
do
so,
which
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
our
basic
point
on
the
question
of
breach,
the
first
issue.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
did.
we
have
relied
completely
on
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
our
brief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
hope
not,
because
i
hope
that
it
is
as
apparent
on
your
further
review
of
this
material
as
it
was
to
me
that
that's
exactly
what
congress
said
it
was
concerned
about.
that
was
exactly
what
congress
wanted
the
secretary
to
address,
and
that's
why
it
took
the
actions
that
it
did
to
compel
him
to
exercise
the
rights
of
the
united
states
under
these
leases.
now,
i
want
to
address
briefly
the
suggestion--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
have...
i...
the
only...
yes,
because
all
that
congress
said
is,
make
a
realistic
review
of
these
environmental
issues.
that
should
have
been--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
no,
no.
i'm
sorry.
this...
i
need
to
get
clear
about
this.
what
is
needed
in
order
to
conduct
the
review
is
a
threat
of
harm.
now,
if
the
investigation
of
that
threatened
harm
results
in
a
finding
that
there's
a
probable
harm,
then
the
secretary
may
cancel
the
leases,
and
the
leases...
the
moneys
would
be
returned.
but
if,
investigating
the
threatened
harm,
there
is
no
resulting
finding
of
a
probable
harm,
then
the
lease
suspension
is
terminated,
operations
recommence
and,
under
the
regulations
throughout
this
entire
period
the
substantial
rights
of
the
lessee
are
protected
by
an
automatic,
rent-free
extension
of
the
lease
for
the
period
that
the
investigation
is
occurring.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
mobil
says
is,
but
there's
a
30-day
approval
period
in
the
statute
for
exploration
plans.
well,
that,
i...
i
think
they
may
have
backed
away
from
that
here,
because
it's
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
history
and,
indeed,
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
that
30-day
approval
period,
like
any
other
period
that
applies
under
this
statute,
may
be
extended
and
suspended
whenever
the
government
concludes
that
a
suspension
is
warranted
and
that,
of
course,
is
exactly
the
reason
that
these
leases
were
suspended
by
the
united
states.
but
even
if
mobil
could
find
a
basis
for
saying
that
we'd
breached
the
lease,
they
still
would
not
be
entitled
to
rescission
unless
they
established
that
there
was
a
material
breach,
one
that,
in
the
words
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
frank
felix
case,
goes
to
the
root
of
the
agreement
and
destroys
its
essential
object
and,
plainly,
mobil
can't
satisfy
that
requirement
for
two
separate
reasons.
the
first
is
that
time
of
performance
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
routinely
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
is
of
the
essence
and,
plainly,
it
was
not
of
the
essence
here
because
the
document
itself
authorizes
suspensions
for
environmental
studies
to
be
conducted
and
protects
the
rights
of
the
lessee
while
those
are
occurring
by
giving
him
rent-free
extensions
of
the
lease
provisions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--like
all
other
issues
of
materiality,
ultimately
you're
looking
at
a
question
that
requires
you
to
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
and
my
point
is
simply
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
lease
are
plainly
that
these
kinds
of
suspensions
are
contemplated.
they
are
understood.
it's
known
it's
going
to
happen.
indeed,
as
this
court
says--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
understand
that...
congress
in
the
obpa
didn't
usurp
authority
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
they
directed
him
to
carefully
exercise
his
authority
to
conduct
investigations
that
he
had
failed
to
do
and
which,
after
congress
directed
him
to,
on
further
reflection
he
decided
yes,
i
should
do
those
additional
studies.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
the
obpa
did
not
alter
by
one
wit
or
jot
the
substantive
standards
by
which
the
secretary
of
interior
ultimately
was...
is
to
determine
whether
to
approve
the
plan
of
exploration.
the
obpa
simply
said,
exercise
the
rights
of
the
united
states
under
this
lease
to
investigate
these
important
environmental
issues
in
a
manner
that
you
have
so
far
failed
to
do.
this
was--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--supervisory.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm
saying
that
congress
had
a
justifiable
concern
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
environmental,
including
human
environmental
analyses
that
had
been
conducted
thus
far.
it
had
received
information
from
the
national
research
council
advising
it
of
the
inadequacies
of
these
investigations
that
had
been
conducted
to
that
date,
and
it
directed
the
secretary
to
conduct
a
thorough,
realistic
review.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's
the
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
mean,
that's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
the
question.
had
they
complied
with
ocsla--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
the
answer
is
no--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because
the
secretary
had
not
yet
been
in
the
position
to
make
the
determination
that
he
was
required
to
make.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
okay.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that,
of
course,
is
an
assumption
that
i
can't
follow
along
on
your
hypothetical
with,
because
plainly
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
ocsla
ultimately,
and
i
think,
however,
the
answer--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that
what
they
probably
bought
was
a
right
to
pursue
the
procedures
that
are
established
in
order
for
them
to
obtain
this
and
that,
of
course,
is
where
we
are.
we're
in
the
middle
of
those
procedures.
we
haven't
repudiated
them.
in
fact,
we're
fully
ready
to
go
forward.
and
that
leads
me
to
the
second
reason
why
the
alleged
breach
isn't
material
which
is
that,
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
explained,
at
all
times,
before
the
obpa
was
enacted,
while
it
was
in
effect,
and
even
to
this
very
minute,
mobil
is
conclusively
barred
from
taking
any
actions
to
drill
or
develop
these
leases
by
the
entirely
separate
provisions
of
the
coastal
zone
management
act.
that
was
a
statute
that
congress
enacted
to
give
the
states
a
voice
in
the
development
of
these
leases
and,
as
this
court
said
in
1984
in
the
secretary
of
interior
case,
lessees
need
to
be
well
aware
of
these
restrictions,
because
they
are
significant,
and
they
can
cause
substantial
delays
in
any
development
of
federal
leases,
and
one
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
again--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--again,
what
we're
deciding
is
that
what--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
it's
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--congress
simply
said
that
there's
enough
information
for
it
to
conclude
that
further
studies
need
to
be
done.
that's
all...
that's
really
what
the
obpa
said.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
all--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is...
i
think
it
might
be
a
reasonable
time,
because
what
congress
actually
suspended...
it
was
until
the
secretary
could
certify
that
he
had
the
information
required
to
make
the
findings
that
he
needed
to
make
under
the
ocsla.
the
secretary
certified
that
he
would
do
that
in
1992,
but
he
found
that
in
order
to
make
the
findings
required
by
the
ocsla
he
had
to
go
out
and
do
the
additional
studies
that
mms
hadn't
yet
done.
when
he
completed
those
studies
in
1994,
mobil
didn't
ask
him
to
review
the
exploration
plan.
mobil
asked
him
to
continue
the
lease
suspensions
in
effect
that
had
been
in
effect
since
before
the
obpa
was
enacted
so
that
mobil
could
continue
its
challenge
to
the
state's
czma
objections,
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
said,
well,
how
can
mobil
say
that
these
leases
that
were
materially
breached
by
these...
by
the
delay
for
federal
review
when
the
alleged
delay
for
federal
review
actually
had
no
consequence
whatever
on
the
ultimate
performance
of
protection
of
mobil's
rights.
the
obpa
was
just
a
little
sliver
of
time
in
the
larger
spectrum
of
things.
before
it
happened,
the
leases
had
been
suspended
at
mobil's
request
because
of
the
czma
objection
of
north
carolina,
and
that
suspension
extends
to
today,
so
the
court,
it
seems
to
us,
correctly
found
there
is
no
material
breach
now.
the
last
point
i
need
to
make
very
briefly,
and
that
is
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
material
breach,
mobil
would
not
be
entitled
to
rescission
because
they
did
not
make
a
prompt
demand
for
it.
mobil
says
that
the
leases
were
breached
in
august
of
1990,
when
the
obpa
was
enacted.
mobil
took
no
steps
to
obtain
rescission
until
october
of
1992,
more
than
2
years
later,
and
during
that
interim
period
mobil
submitted
an
exploration
plan,
challenged
the
state's
czma
objections,
and
obtained...
2
weeks
before
it
filed
this
lawsuit
obtained
a
perpetual
extension
from
the
united
states
of
these
leases
rent-free
so
that
mobil
could
challenge
the
state's
czma
objection.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
can
press
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
key
difference
is
that
they
didn't
just
press.
they
obtained
performance,
even
if,
in
their
view,
it
was
imperfect
performance.
the
rights--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
obtained...
the
united
states
spent
2
years
doing
the
environmental
reviews
that
were
needed
to
put
it
in
the
position
to
determine
whether
to
approve
the
exploration
plans.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
was
additional
performance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
that
wasn't
the
quid
pro--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
was
the
additional
performance
by
the
united
states.
also,
the
united
states
and
16
agencies--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--perform--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
may
have
been
what
they
ultimately
wanted,
but
in
order
to
get
there
the
united
states
had
to
perform
many
tasks,
one
of
which
was
to
put
themselves
in
a
position
to
do
this
environmental
determination,
which
it
was...
and
when
the
united
states
finally
got
itself
in
the
position
to
make
that
environmental
determination,
mobil
didn't
ask
it
to
do
it.
mobil
said,
we
want
additional
lease
suspensions
to
challenge
the
czma.
now,
what
this
court
said
in
the
smoot's
case
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
more
recently
said
in
far
west
is
that
a
party
seeking
rescission
can't
seek
and
obtain
some
kind
of
imperfect
performance
from
the
other
party
and
then--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--come
back
and
say
the
contract
is
at
an
end.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
well,
mobil
did
get
a
change
in
position
by
getting
the
rent-free
extensions,
but
that's
not
really--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--mobil
also
got
16
agencies
to
conduct
a
review
of
its
lease
request--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--to
do
what
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
my--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--point.
we
had
to
take
those
actions
to
perform
our
side
of
the
contract.
now,
rescission,
the
purpose
of
rescission
is
to
restore
you
to
the
status
quo
ante.
you
can't
restore
a
party
to
the
status
quo
ante
when
you
propel
them
into
further
performance,
even
if
it's
imperfect,
and
then
say,
oh,
but
really,
let's
treat
the
contract
like
an
end.
this
court
so
held--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
not
that
they're
losing
a
remedy,
justice
souter.
it's
that
they
have
a
different
remedy.
their
remedy
is
to
seek
damages
if
they
had
any,
which
they
don't
contend
they
do,
and
they
obviously
didn't,
because
they
were
barred--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
you
can
get
rescission
sometime
when
you
can't
get
damages,
but
you
can't
get
rescission
when
you
propel
the
other
party
into
additional
performance
and
then,
2
years
later,
say,
oh,
well,
let's
undo
it
after
all.
now,
mobil
plainly
knew
what
they
were
doing.
they
plainly
sought
to
perfect
their
rights
under
the
leases,
rather
than
to
abrogate
them,
and
it
was
that
2
years
of
efforts
to
perfect
their
rights
that
limits
them
so
they
can't
get
rescission.
now,
the
other
remedy
they
get
is
the
one
that
they're
entitled
to
under
these
leases,
which
is
a
rent-free
lease
extension
which
leaves
them
in
the
same...
they
have
the
same
rights
today
that
they
had
even
before
the
obpa
was
enacted,
because
they
have
requested
and
obtained
10
years,
now,
worth
of
rent-free
extensions
of
their
lease
rights.
now,
through
this
period
they
say
the
united
states
hasn't
performed
as
well
as
it
should
have,
but
they
can't
honestly
say
that
the
united
states
has
not,
at
their
insistence
and
sometimes
on
its
own,
decided
to
take
steps
to
perform
its
obligations
under
the
lease.
