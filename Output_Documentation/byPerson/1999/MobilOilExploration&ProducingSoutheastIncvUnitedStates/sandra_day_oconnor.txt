mr.
phillips,
may
i
ask,
this
is
a
case
with
some
complex
provisions,
and
is
it
the
case
that
under
the
lease
the
government
had
the
power
at
least
to
suspend
the
lease?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
congress--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
act
also
suspended
everything
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
that's
hardly
a
reasonable
time,
is
it?
