we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-244,
mobil
oil
exploration
and
producing
v.
united
states,
marathon
oil
company
v.
united
states.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
phillips,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
some
factual
issues
here.
you
claim
repudiation.
you
claim
a
material
breach.
you
seek
restitution.
the
government
says
you
may
have
waived
by
continued
performance.
are
the
findings
of
the...
of
a
claims
court
judge
in
this
case
sufficient
to
support
your
view?
in
other
words--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
have
to
argue
for
some
factual
determination
here
different
from
that
made
by
the
claims
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
says
you
waived
the
acceptance
of
the
repudiation,
if
that's
the
right
phrase,
by
continued
performance.
now,
did
the
claims
court
judge
make
finding...
was
that
raised
in
the
claims
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
never
made
that
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
were
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you...
what
page
are
you
reading
from,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
what
number?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
15...
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
the
same
finding
as
the
statute
calls
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
are
you
reading
from?
what
are
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
human
environment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
just
says
potentially.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's...
that's
vague,
typical
congressional
language--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
know,
backing
back
and
forth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
i
agree
with
the...
but
you're
saying
it's
not
only
directs
the
secretary,
but
it
suffices
for
the
finding
required
under
the
other
law,
and
i'm
saying
i
don't
think
it
does.
now,
we
can
disagree
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
claims
court
judge...
i'm
reading
from
71a...
it
said,
clearly
the
old...
he
said,
clearly
the
obpa
imposed
severe,
burdensome
new
conditions
upon
the
department
of
interior's
obligations
under
ocsla
to
approve
poe's
offshore
north
carolina.
now,
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
you
can
get
rescission
lots
of
times
when
you
can't
get
damages,
just
when
there's
an
early
repudiation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
13
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court

no.

producing
