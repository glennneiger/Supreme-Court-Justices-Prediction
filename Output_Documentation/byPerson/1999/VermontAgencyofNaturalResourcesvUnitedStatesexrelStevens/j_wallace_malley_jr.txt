mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
asked
us,
of
course,
to
brief
and
argue
an
additional
issue
in
this
case,
and
with
the
leave
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
that
issue.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
thank
you.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
additional
issue,
of
course,
is
whether
a
private
person
has
article
iii
standing
to
litigate
claims
of
fraud
against
the
government.
and
within
the
context
of
the
false
claims
act,
we
would
submit
not,
your
honor.
taking
the
respondents'
own
view
of
this
case
that
all
that
has
been
asserted
here
are
the
injuries
to
the
united
states...
and
i
would
invite
this
court's
attention
to
paragraph
44
of
the...
of
the
relator's
complaint
in
this
case
at
page
40
of
the
joint
appendix...
the
claim
is
that
the
united
states
has
been
damaged.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
this
relator
has
been
damaged.
so,
in
that
circumstance,
there
is
no
standing,
for
under
this
court's
determination
in...
in
the
lujan
case,
the
irreducible
constitutional
minimum
of
standing
is,
of
course,
injury
in
fact,
actual
and
particularized
to
this
plaintiff.
and
as
judge
weinstein
indicated
in
the
dissenting
opinion
below,
up
to
the
moment
he
filed
this
action,
this
relator
had
no
greater
interest
than
any
taxpayer.
so,
this
complainant--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--we
have,
your
honor,
and
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
the--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--some
circumstances,
and
i
think
that
the
key
part
of
your
question,
your
honor,
was
in
some
form.
now,
we
of
course
are
going
to
be
filing
our
brief
on
this
tomorrow,
and
we've
taken
a
look
at
all
of
these...
these
statutes--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--the
early
statutes
in
the
first
congress,
and
if
i've
got
my
sort
of
head
count
correct,
i...
we've
counted
about
17
statutes.
and
of
those,
14
fall
into
situations
which
don't
raise
any...
any
standing
issue
whatsoever.
we
have--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--well,
there's
a
couple
of
ways
it
plays
out.
one...
one
would
be
that...
that
probably
the
largest
single
category
is
where
the
individual
just
has
a
bounty,
doesn't
have
any
right
to
bring
the
case
into
court,
but
just
gets
a
bounty
at...
at
the
tail
end.
so,
that
doesn't
raise
a
standing
issue.
and
then
there's
about
three
or
four
where
the...
the
case
can
be
brought
into
court
by
a...
by
an
individual
who's...
who
is
a
federal
official.
now,
in
that
instance
i
think
it's
fair
to
regard
that
as
a
case
that's
brought
by
the
united
states
by
a
federal
official
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
federal
official
can
also
claim
part
of
the
bounty.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
the
fact
that
this
qui
tam
relator
is
entitled
to
something
i
think
that...
that
that...
that
is
a
bounty
which
gives
this
relator
an
incentive
to
sue.
but,
of
course,
under
the
valley
forge
decision
of
this
court,
that
strong
incentive
and
the
fervor
of
the...
of
the
litigant's
convictions
is
not
enough
to
grant
standing.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
in
that
first
group
i
was
talking
about...
i
think
there's
five
in
this
category...
they
would
bring
the
attention...
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
government,
the
government
would
sue,
and
there
would
be
a...
a
bounty
at...
at
the
tail
end.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
there...
there
were,
of
course,
a
small
number
of
cases--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--and
our
count
is
three...
where
it
would
appear
that...
that
the
individual
could
bring
the
claim
into
court
himself
or
herself.
but
of
course,
one
of
those
was
actually
a...
a
criminal
case
in--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--there
is
that
common
law
background.
but
of
course,
i
think
what's
critical
in
this...
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
is...
is
what
the
court
has
indicated
in
marsh
v.
chambers
and
that
is
it's
one
thing
where
there's
a...
a
continuous
and
unambiguous
historic
record
which...
which
creates
a
practice
which...
which
has
become
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
society.
but
it's...
but
that
certainly
is
not
even
remotely
the
case
here
where
we
have
had
some
form
of
the
so-called
qui
tam
actions
in
various
permutations.
they
were
very
popular
at
the
time
of
the
first
congress,
of
course,
fell
into
disuse,
and...
and
really
wasn't
revived
again
until
this
formulation
under
the
false
claims
act,
which
in
and
of
itself
fell
into...
into
disuse
between
1943
and
1986.
so,
i
don't
think
we
have
the
situation
here
where
we
can
look
back
and
get
a
clear
message
from
the
historic
record,
whether
it
be
from
english
common
law
or
from
our
own
american
jurisprudence.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor,
and...
and
of
course,
obviously,
we
have
to
look
at
the
time
of
the
convention.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
and
this
is...
this
is
the
reason
why.
i...
i
think
that...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
if
these
qui
tam
statutes
were
all
of
a
kind
where...
where
we
could
see
a
common
thread
there,
then
we
might
be
able
to
draw
some
inferences
from
that.
but...
but
that...
but
that
is...
that
is
not
the
case.
and
of
course,
history
alone
cannot...
cannot
overcome
the
irreducible
constitutional
minimum
of...
of
article
iii
standing.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
obviously
they
hadn't.
but...
but
in
fact,
i
think
they
had
something
different
on
their
mind
at
the
time.
i
think
what
they
had
on
their
mind
at
the
time
was
a
new
republic.
they
didn't
have
the
institutions
and
the
blessings
of
a
new
republic
that
we
have
today.
they
do
not
have
the...
did
not
have
the
institutions
of
a
department
of
justice
which
was
ready
and
available
to
prosecute
the
laws.
they
needed
help.
and...
and
they
were
certainly...
certainly
they
were
looking
for...
for
help.
and
i...
i...
there's
nothing
in
the
historic
record--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that
was...
that
was
not
the...
the
only
one.
and
moreover,
what
is
further
absent
from
the
historic
record
is
any
debate
that
we
could
find
on...
on
something
to
do
with
separation
of
powers
or
cases
and
controversies
in
the
context
of...
of
these
so-called
qui
tam
actions.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
not
without
violating
the
eleventh
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
but
the
point...
the
point
really
that...
that
i
think
is...
is
urgent
in
this
case...
that
is,
that...
is
that
this
relator
cannot...
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
either...
either
they
have
standing
and
then
run
headlong
into
the...
to
the
bar
of
the
eleventh
amendment
or--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--absolutely,
your
honor.
we
believe
that...
that
all
three
issues
are
in
play
in
this
case,
and
both
the
statutory
construction
issue
which,
you
know,
harkening
back
to
mr.
chief
justice's
remarks
in
the
last
case,
that
where
there's
a...
where
there's
a
statutory
issue
involved,
then
the
court
normally
does
not
go
to
the
constitutional
issues.
so,
we
feel
the
statutory
construction
issue
is
in
play
and
certainly
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
normally
you
certainly
wouldn't,
and
particularly
in
the
case
where
it's
an
unrelated
issue.
but
as
the
courses...
in...
in
the
swint
case,
we
read
the
swint
case
as
having
left
the
door
open.
if...
if
the
court
has
before
it
a
case
that's--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that...
i
think
that...
that
in
all
likelihood,
if
i
can
just
speculate,
the
reason
for
that
was
to
leave
open
the
option
in...
in
those
circumstances
where
the
issues
are
inextricably
intertwined
and
where...
it
might
not
be
meaningful
to...
to
answer
the...
you
know,
the...
the
central
question
without
answering
the
other.
and
here,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
mean,
what
do
you
look
to?
you
have
to
look
to,
well,
who...
who
is
suing
and
who
can
be
sued.
and...
and
examination
of
the
statute
is
rather
critical
to
looking
to
that
issue.
so,
i...
we
believe
it's...
it's
certainly
fair
game.
and
even
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
as
compared
to
the...
to
the
article
iii
standing
issue,
admitting
the
fact
that
this...
this
court
has...
has
indicated
a
strong
preference
to
go
to
the
article
iii
issue
first,
still
the...
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
is
one
that
is
a
jurisdictional
issue,
and
i
think
this
court
in
the
shack
case
recognized
that...
that
it...
that
it
enjoyed
a
status...
a
jurisdictional
status,
perhaps
somewhere
between
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
personal
jurisdiction.
and...
and
so,
we
believe
they're...
they're
co-equal
and
the
court
could
choose,
particularly
in
the
aftermath
of
all
alden
and
blatchford,
which
has
really
developed
the
issue
for
this
case...
could
choose
to
go
straight
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
no,
certainly,
justice
scalia,
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
court
has
to
go
to
that
issue.
i
was
only
suggesting
the
swint
case
seems
to
have
left
the
door
open
should
it...
should
it
choose
to
address
the
statutory
issue
as
a...
as
a
way...
as
being
prior
to
the
constitutional
issue.
i
certainly
don't
suggest
that...
that
this
court
has
tied
its
hands
in
any
way.
that's
all.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
and...
and
we're...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
we
would
be
happy
if
the
court
addressed
this
case
on
any
of
the
three
issues.
[laughter]
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
no.
i...
i
cannot...
i
cannot
cite
one
to
the
court,
and--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--and
i...
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
suggest
that,
you
know,
the
court,
you
know,
has...
has
to
go
that
direction.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
the
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--that...
that
has
been
the
practice,
of
course,
as...
as
stated
in
the...
in
the
will
case.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
and...
and--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
indicated
its...
its
preference
to
go
to
jurisdictional
issues
as
a
threshold
matter.
so,
i...
all
i'm
saying
is
i
think
the
choices
are
there.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
thank...
thank
you
for
that
segue,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
the...
the
critical...
the
critical
portion
of
the
eleventh
amendment
article,
which...
argument
which
i
really
have
not
had
a
chance
to...
to
speak
much
to,
stems
from
the
fact
that
we
have
a
qui
tam
relator,
a
private
person
of
his
own
motivation,
of
his
own
initiative,
his
own
motivation,
and
under
the
hughes
case,
a
motivation
for
personal
gain
and...
and
perhaps
ill
will
and...
and
not
for
the
public
good,
has
brought
the
state
of
vermont
into
court
without
its
consent.
and
we
believe
that
violates
the...
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
most
particularly,
the
interest
as
laid
forth
in...
in
this
court
in
the
alden
and
blatchford
cases
where
the
nature
of
the
consent
to
suit
by
the
united
states
in
the
plan
of
the
convention
was
a
suit
brought
by
responsible
federal
officials
exercising
political
responsibility.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
i...
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and...
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that...
that
under
the
edelman
decision,
mere
participation
in
a
federal
program
is...
is
not...
is
not
enough.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
well,
of
course,
there
wouldn't
be
any...
just
looking
at
it
from
a...
you
know,
a
contract
standpoint,
what
was
the
meeting
of
the
minds,
well,
certainly
in
the
context
of
a...
of
a
false
claims
act
statute
which
is...
is
to
be
interpreted,
which
of
course
doesn't
define
the
term
person,
and
much...
must
be
interpreted--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--no,
but--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--well,
even
if
we
assume
that,
your
honor,
the...
the...
how
could
there
be
a
meeting
of
the
minds?
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
meeting
of
the
minds
if...
if
the...
if
the
state
goes
into
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
united
states
knowing
that
it
is...
it
consents
to
the
remedies
that
the
united
states
can
bring,
those...
those
kinds
of
suits
that
are
authorized
by
alden
and
blatchford
but...
but
does...
but
is
not
consenting
to
suits
by
private
persons.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
well,
i
would
say,
justice
souter,
that...
that...
that
if
it
was
clear
under
the
clear
statement
rule
and
that
that...
the
false
claims
act--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--but...
but
under
the
pennhurst
case,
your
honor,
the...
the
congress
must
make
its
intention
clear
and
manifest
if
it...
if
it
intends
to
impose
a
condition
on
the
grant
of
federal
monies
upon
a
state.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
certainly...
certainly
that
and
also
the
effect
that
would...
that
would...
that
would
be
involved
in...
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
of
course,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
merely...
merely
felt
that...
that
there
was
a...
the
claim
was--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--no...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
the
contract...
the
agreement
under
which
we
entered
into
this
arrangement
required
that
the
state
of
vermont
submit
to
a
range
of...
of
remedies.
most
particularly
are
those
under
40
c.f.r.,
part
31
which
require
for
a
full
range
of
supplying
records
to
the
united
states,
submitting
to
performance
reviews,
the
possibility
of
withholding
cash
payments,
the
possibility
of
disallowing
part
of
prior
costs,
suspension
of
the
program,
even...
even
that
the
united
states
environmental
protection
agency
could
come
in
and...
and
take
over
and
operate
these
clean
water
act
programs.
and
there
was
nothing
in
there
suggesting
that...
that
part
of
the
deal
was
that...
that
the
state
of
vermont
had
to
comply
with
a
false
claims
act
and
particularly
one
that...
that
doesn't...
doesn't
apply
to
the
states.
your
honor--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--i...
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two,
your
honor.
if...
if
there
had
been
a
prior
case
that
had
found
that
states
are
persons-plaintiffs,
then
obviously
we
would
have
to...
we
would
have
to
get
over
the
hurdle
of,
you
know,
the
consistent
meaning
doctrine.
but
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
can
be
a...
can
be
a
defendant
person,
then
the...
the
test
is
so
different
that
i
don't
think
that
they
provide
any
real
comparability.
for
example,
under
the
will
case,
it
was
the
fact
that...
that
defining
the
term
person
to
include
a
state
implicated
actions
which
upset
the
constitutional
balance
between
state
and
federal
governments,
and
for
that
reason,
it...
it
implicated
the
clear
statement
rule.
and
now
here
in
this
case
where
this
statute
would
purport
to
lay
down
huge
penalties
on
the
state,
treble
damages
and...
and
civil
penalties
up
to
10,000--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--we...
we
do
not...
we
do
not
assert
that,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--we...
we
do
not...
we
do
not
believe,
given
the
plain
statement
of...
of
the
meaning--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--the
state...
the
state
could
bring
that.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
have
not.
other
states
have,
but...
but
vermont
has
not.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
i
do
not
have
that
number
in
mind,
your
honor,
but...
but
my
distinct
impression
is
it
is...
it
is
precious
little.
i
think
we
cited
the
graber
case
where
the
united
states
was
involved.
but
i
think
the
reason...
the
reason
that
i
cannot
name
a
single
case
is...
is
that
the...
the
united
states
has
so
many
remedies
involving
the
states
with
regard
to
the
carrying
out
of
these...
these
grant
programs
that...
that
the
false
claims
act
really
is...
is
not
necessary.
i
mean,
it...
it...
for
one
thing,
the
epa
officials
in
this
instance
are
in
our
offices
on
a
regular
basis
working
hand
in
hand
to
implement
these
programs.
they...
they
know
what's
going
on.
they
have
the
full
range
of
administrative
remedies
if
necessary
under
40
c.f.r.,
and
even
if
it's
necessary
to
get
to
issues
involving
lawsuits,
which...
which
rarely
is
the
case,
there,
of
course,
are
common
law
actions
that
are
available,
such
as
unjust
enrichment,
common
law
fraud,
and
so
forth.
but
i
think
the
reason
that...
that
these
cases
are
virtually
nonexistent
is
that
they
are...
are
not
necessary.
and
for
that
reason,
there's
nothing
really
anomalous
about
construing
the
false
claims
act
as
not
applying
to
the
states.
in
fact,
the
1980...
the
congress...
the
1986
congress
passed
the
program
fraud
civil...
civil
remedies
act
which
provided
some
additional
administrative
remedies,
but
explicitly
included
corporations
and
individuals
and
partnerships
but
not
the
states.
and
the
reason
is,
we
submit,
that
it's
because
they
have
all
of
the
ammunition
that
they
already
need
to
keep
the...
the
states
squeaky
clean.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
retain
my
time.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
in
marcus
v.
hess,
this
court
in
1943,
construing
the
earlier
1805
case,
said
that
those
cases
that
gave
a
common
informer
award
were
to
be
construed
as
including
the
right
to
bring
the
action
to
recover
that
reward
by
the
qui
tam
relator.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
1943.
so
that
those
23
statutes,
which
included
a
number...
which
created
a
direct
right
in
the
statute
itself,
included
a
number
that
created
the
fund
for
the
common
informer,
and
this
court
has
construed
those
as
allowing
that
kind
of
a
right.
this
court
has
also
recognized
in
marcus
v.
hess,
and
congress
has
recognized,
that
this
is
one
of
the
least
expensive
and
most
effective
means
of
preventing
fraud
on...
on
the
treasury.
it's
important
to
understand,
in
considering
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
that
this
is...
a
qui
tam
action
is
brought
under
the
statute
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
impose
a
liability
owed
to
the
united
states.
it
redresses
injury
to
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
just
like
to
focus
on
the
inconsistency
which
i
believe
i
just
heard
from
the
government's
case.
on
the
one
hand,
the
government
admits
that
it
has...
that
the
relator
has
no
prior
injury
in
this
case,
no
prior
injury
prior
to
bringing
this
suit.
well,
if
that's
the
case,
there
is
no
standing.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
assignments...
assignments
certainly
are
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but
that's
not--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--but
this...
this
is...
it's
certainly
not
like
an...
an
assignment.
we
don't
have
anything
to
indicate,
number
one,
that
that's
an
assignment.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
there's
been
some
transfer
of
ownership
of...
of...
of
the...
of
the
injury
that's...
in
fact...
in
fact,
the
united
states
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
they
want
to
both
say
that
it's...
it's
an
assignment,
and...
but...
but
they
still
have
it.
and
that's
exactly
the
problem
here,
is
that...
is
that
on
the
one
hand,
they
want
to
say
it's
only
the
united
states'
claim
that's
being
brought
here,
and
in
that
case
there's
a
standing
problem.
on
the
other
hand,
they
want
to
say
that
once
the
case
is
filed,
that...
that
the
relator
captures
it
and
makes
it
his
own.
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
it's
an
eleventh
amendment
problem.
we
submit
they
cannot
have
it--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--a
joint...
a
joint
tenancy--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
in...
in
that...
in
that
instance
either
joint
tenant
has
his
or
her
own
specific
property
interest,
and
when
that's
infringed
upon--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--but
it...
but...
but
up
until
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
there
was...
there
was
no
injury.
this...
this...
i
mean,
as...
as
the
court
has
observed
in...
in
the
sierra
club
and
lujan,
is
that
the
plaintiff
must
be
among
those
who
were
injured,
and
there
is
no
injury.
admittedly
they
have
procedural
interests,
but
these
are
not--
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
but
i'm
just
submitting
this
is
not
an
assignee
here.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
well,
except
for
the
eleventh
amendment,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
wallace
malley,
jr.
let
me
just
underscore
one...
one
other
point
and
that's
the
need
for
the
plain
statement
rule
here.
this
relator
is
claiming,
just
on
civil
penalties
alone,
a
claim
for
25
million.
that...
that
exceeds
the
total
annual
outlay
for
the
department
of
environmental
conservation
in
the
state
of
vermont
by
about
7
million.
now,
clearly
if
that's
what
was
implicated
in
this
statute,
there
should
be
a
plain
statement
rule
so
that
we
can
be
on
fair
notice
that
that
is
what
has
happened.
your
honor,
we
submit
that's
not
what
happened.
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
this
case.
