justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
under
the
false
claims
act,
a
private
person
known
as
the
relator
may
bring
a
civil
action
“in
the
name
of
the
government”
against
“any
person”
who
among
other
things
knowingly
presents
to
the
government
a
false
or
fraudulent
claim
for
payment.
the
relator
receives
a
share
of
the
proceeds
from
the
action
where
the
remainder
of
course
going
to
the
government.
such
actions
brought
by
private
persons
on
behalf
of
the
government
are
known
as
qui
tam
action,
latin
name
with
which
the
pleadings
used
to
begin.
respondent
stevens
brought
this
qui
tam
action
against
petitioner,
a
vermont
state
agency
alleging
that
it
had
submitted
false
claims
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
in
connection
with
various
federal
grant
programs
administered
by
that
agency.
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
making
two
arguments:
first,
that
a
state
or
a
state
agency
is
not
a
person
subject
to
liability
under
the
false
claims
act;
and
second,
that
a
qui
tam
action
in
federal
court
against
the
state
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
which
generally
prohibits
private
suits
against
the
state
by
citizens
of
other
states
in
federal
court.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
petitioner,
the
state,
filed
an
interlocutory
appeal.
respondent,
united
states
intervened
in
the
appeal
in
support
of
respondent
stevens,
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
we
reverse.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
we
conclude
that
stevens
has
a
standing
to
bring
this
suit.
stevens
meets
all
of
the
requirements
necessary
to
establish
standing
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
in
particular
he
has
demonstrated
injury
in
fact
that
is
a
harm,
which
is
concrete,
actual
and
imminent,
not
conjectural
or
hypothetical.
we
agree
with
vermont
that
the
interest
that
stevens
has
in
the
outcome
of
the
suit,
namely
the
bounty
he
will
receive,
if
the
suit
is
successful,
is
insufficient
to
confer
standing
since
that
interest
does
not
consist
of
obtaining
compensation
for
or
preventing
the
violation
of
a
legally
protected
right.
it
is
not
compensating
him
for
any
injury.
stevens
relies,
however,
upon
the
injury
in
fact
suffered
by
the
united
states,
both
the
injury
to
its
sovereignty
arising
from
violation
of
its
laws
and
the
proprietary
injury
resulting
from
the
alleged
fraud.
we
conclude
that
an
adequate
basis
for
stevens
standing
is
to
be
found
in
the
doctrine
that
an
assignee
of
a
claim
has
standing
to
assert
the
injury,
in
fact
suffered
by
the
assignor.
the
false
claims
act
can
reasonably
be
regarded
as
affecting
a
partial
assignment
of
the
government’s
damages
claim.
this
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
the
long
tradition
of
qui
tam
actions
in
england
and
the
american
colonies,
which
demonstrates
that
such
actions
were
cases
and
controversies
of
this
sort
traditionally
amendable
to
and
resolved
by
judicial
process.
we
express
no
view
on
the
question
whether
qui
tam
suits
violate
article
ii
of
the
constitution
as
oppose
to
article
iii
in
particularly
the
appointments
clause
of
section
2
and
the
“take
care”
clause
of
section
3.
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
matter,
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
eleventh
amendment
question.
we
conclude
that
the
false
claims
act
does
not
by
its
terms
subject
to
state
or
a
state
agency
to
liability
because
of
the
longstanding
interpretive
presumption
that
the
statutory
term,
‘person’
does
not
include
the
sovereign,
although
that
is
not
a
hard
and
fast
rule
of
exclusion.
the
presumption
may
be
disregarded
only
upon
some
affirmative
showing
of
statutory
intent
to
the
contrary.
various
features
of
the
false
claims
act
both
has
originally
enacted
and
as
amended
far
from
providing
the
requisite
affirmative
indications
that
the
term
‘person’
includes
states
indicate
quite
the
contrary.
this
conclusion
is
buttressed
by
two
additional
considerations.
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
if
congress
intends
to
alter
the
usual
constitutional
balance
between
states
and
the
federal
government,
it
must
make
its
intention
to
do
so
unmistakably
clear,
and
the
doctrine
that
statute
should
be
construed
so
as
to
avoid
difficult
constitutional
questions,
in
this
case
the
eleventh
amendment
question.
