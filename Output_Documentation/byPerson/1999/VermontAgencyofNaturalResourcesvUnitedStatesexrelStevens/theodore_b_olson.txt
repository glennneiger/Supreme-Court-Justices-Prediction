mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
statute...
the
statute
provides
that
while
the
government
takes
over
the
action,
that...
that
the...
the
relators
still
can
make
a
claim
for
the
portion
of
recovery.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
earlier
segment
of
the
argument
has
already
delved
into,
the
qui
tam
mechanism
has
existed
for
centuries.
it
was
well
known
when
our
constitution
was
created.
it
was
adopted
23
times
by
our
count
by
the
first
four
congresses
of
the
united
states.
it
has
been
recognized
by
congress
and
by
this
court
on
various
occasions.
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
and
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
are
addressing...
i'm
addressing
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
because
the...
because
we're...
our
argument,
as
we've
articulated
in
the
brief,
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
has
to
be
considered
based
upon
the
fact
that
this
is
a
claim
that
belongs
to
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
will
do
that
at
any
time.
the...
in
fact,
i
will
do
that
now.
it
is
very
clear
under
the
statute
that
section
3733
defines
the
word
false
claim
law
to
include
sections
3729
through
3733.
it...
it
defines
the
term
false
claim
investigation
as
including
an
investigation
as
to
whether
anyone
has
violated
a
false
claims
law,
which
was
defined
to
include
3729,
and
then
it
defines
person
to
include
a
state.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
but
it...
it
specifically
defines
in
those
three
terms...
in
3733,
there's
only
one
way
to
read
the
conjunction
of
those
three
terms.
false
claims
investigation
specifically
defines
false
claims
investigation
as
including
an
investigation
as
to
whether
any
person
violated
the
false
claims
law,
which
is
included--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but...
but
section...
that
same
definition
section
includes
a
definition
of
false
claims
law
to
include
section
3729
through
3722.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
clear
statement.
there's
only
one
way
to
read
that
section,
especially
when
you
take
it
into...
into
consideration
with
the
legislative
history
where
it
was
quite
clear
in
the
senate
judiciary
report
that
the
congress
understood
at--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
contend
that
it
is...
it
is
unclear
with
respect
to
the
1863
version,
but
it
is
quite
clear
with
respect
to
the
1966
amendment
which
removed
the
first
section
which
defined
a
person
not
in
the
service
of
the
military
and...
and
eliminated
that
section,
put
in
a
new
section
which
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
think
it's
considerably
stronger
with
respect
to
the
amendment
in
1866.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
the
case
is
quite
weak,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
we
could
make
a
very
good
argument,
but
possibly
not
persuasive
to
this
court.
but
it's
a
very
persuasive
argument
when
you
take
into
consideration
that
the...
the
definitional
section
was
stricken
and
replaced
with
the
words
any
person.
any
person
is
defined
in
the
statute
to
include
states.
section...
the
provision
can
be
also
construed
to
give
states
a
right
as
plaintiffs
under
the
statute,
and
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
anomalous
in...
in
marcus
v.
hess,
the
same
case
i
meant
before.
the
court
held
that
the
false
claims
act
cannot
have
one
meaning
for
actions
brought
by
public
officials
and
quite
a
different
meaning
when
the
same
language
is
invoked
by
a
qui
tam
plaintiff.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it...
i...
i
thought
that
was
a
difficult
construction
to
make
at
first,
your
honor,
until
i
read
the
statutes
carefully
together,
including
all
three
of
the
definitions,
the
definition
of
false
claims
law,
which
is
in
(l)(1),
the
false
claims
law
investigation
in
(l)(2),
and
the
definition
of
the
word
person
in
(l)(4).
if
you
put
those
together
with
the
provisions
that
appear
to
allow
states
to
bring
cases
as
plaintiffs,
if
you
put
that
together
with
the
change
in
the
definition
to
include
any
person--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and...
and
if
you...
and
if
you
put
it
together
with
the
senate
judiciary
committee
report
which
was
quite
clear
that
the
senate
was
assuming
that
states
were
persons
under
the
statute
as
it
was...
being
adopted--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
seems
to
me
all
of
this
put
together,
including
the
senate
report,
including
the
fact
that
this
is
an
action
by
the
united
states
to
protect
the
property
of
the
united
states
against
fraud
against
the
united
states,
and
you
don't...
this
court
has
held
you
don't
need
that
so-called
plain
statement
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
claims
by
the
united
states
can
be
brought
against
states,
and
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
protecting
its
property
from
fraud,
all
of
those
put
together,
it
strike
me
make
a
very
persuasive
case
that
the
statute
intended
to
include
states
as
persons.
certainly
the
people
reading
this
report
in
the
senate
and
in...
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
have
assumed
that
that
is
what
congress
was
doing
in
1966.
it
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--or
states
who
might
have
been
in
favor
of
it
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
states
have
been
bringing
cases
under
the...
under
the
false
claims
act,
as...
as
the
discussion
heretofore
has
indicated.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it...
it...
if
standing
alone,
that
might
be
the
case,
but
standing
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
the
senate
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
specifically
defined
the
word
person
to
include
the
state
in
section
3733.
and
as
i
said,
if
one
reads
those
three
provisions
together,
plus
the
provision
in
3732
i
believe
it
was
that
makes
it
relatively
clear
that
states
can
be
plaintiffs
under
these
circumstances
and
can
have
pendent
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
fraud
against
the
state
treasury,
the
package
makes
it
relatively
clear.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
fact
is
it...
i
don't
think
it
requires
quite
a
few
props,
but
it
has
quite
a
few
props,
and
that
makes
it
doubly
persuasive.
the--
[laughter]
with...
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment
question,
this
court
has
repeatedly,
since
the
late
19th
century,
determined
that
eleventh
amendment
questions
have
to
be
determined
based
upon
who
is
the
real
party
in
interest,
not
who
is
the
nominal
party,
but
who
gets
the
benefit
of
the
judgment,
who...
upon
whom
will
the
effect
of
the
judgment
be
imposed.
and
in
this
case
it's
quite
clear.
as
i
was
saying,
it
is
a
case
that's
brought
for
fraud
against
the
united
states
imposing
liability
to
the
united
states
for
damage
done
to
the
united
states,
a
recovery
based
upon
damages
to
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
we...
in
the
case
of
arizona
v.
california,
the
court
talked
about
whether
an
intervenor
who
would
not
change
the
outcome
of
a
case
would
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
eleventh
amendment
issues.
and
the
court
said,
since
the
intervention
of
those
parties,
which
were
indian
tribes
in
that
case,
would
not
make
any
different
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
liability,
mr.
stevens'--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--he
initiates
the
suit.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
only
one
cause
of
action,
justice
scalia,
under
the
statute
and
that's
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
if
he
participates
by
conducting
the
case
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
subject
to
the
attorney
general's
power
to
dismiss
the
suit
and
to
settle
the
suit
and
to
intervene
at
any
time,
then
he's
entitled
to
recover
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
paid
to
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--as
i...
as
i
read
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
decisions,
the...
the
party
who
receives
the
primary
benefit
of
the
action
is
perceived
to
be
the
real
party
in
interest.
and
in
fact,
whether
certain
of
the
proceeds
that
are
payable
to
the
united
states
might
subsequently
be
paid
to
mr.
stevens
as
a
relator
would
not
change
the
fundamental
character
of
it
being
an
action
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
for
a
liability--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
are
several.
in
fact,
there's
a
long
line
of
cases--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--one
is
kansas
v.
the
united
states,
which
is
at
204
u.s.--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
there
are
other
cases,
and
i
can't
give
you
the
name
of
the
case,
but
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
brief
in
which
the
same
test
was
applied
with
respect
to
questions
of
sovereignty
irrespective
of
whether--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--some
of
the
cases
cited
were
original
jurisdiction
cases.
some
of
them
were
not
original
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
those
are
cited
in
the
brief,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
can't
give
you
the
names
of
those.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
fundamental
difference
in
those
cases
are
those
cases
are
brought
by...
in
the
case
where
it's
brought
by
the
united
states,
it
is
brought
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
the
cases...
in
the
alden
case
and
in
the
blatchford
case,
the
court
was...
the
court
was
dealing
there
with
cases
that
were
brought
by
plaintiffs
on
their
own
behalf
and
not
bringing
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
united
states
remains
the
real
party
in
interest
because
the
united
states'
fundamental
interest
in
that
case
is
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
no--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
is
no
question,
justice
scalia,
and
we're
not
denying
the
fact
that
the
relator
in
these
cases
has
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
and
that
is
the
nominal
form--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
enforce
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
to
vindicate...
but
to
vindicate
the
fundamental
interests
of
the
united
states
and
to
protect
the
broader
interest
of
the
united
states
in
deterring...
not
just
redressing,
but
also
deterring
fraud
against
the
united
states.
the
purpose
for
this
statute
is
to
vindicate
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
the
fact
that
mr.
stevens
brings
the
case
under
scrupulous
controls,
considerable
controls
by
the
attorney
general
does
not
change
the
fundamental
character
as
it
being
an
action
being
pursued
for
the
benefit
and
to
achieve
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
