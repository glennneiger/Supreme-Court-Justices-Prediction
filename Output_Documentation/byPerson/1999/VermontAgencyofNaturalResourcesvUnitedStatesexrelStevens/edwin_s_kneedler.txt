mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
vermont
has
raised
the
question
of
article
iii
standing,
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
brief
responses.
a
qui
tam
action,
it
seems
to
us,
is
precisely
what
the
court
had
in
mind
in
its
decision
in
lujan
v.
defenders
of
wildlife
in
distinguishing
the
standing
issue
there
from
a
situation
in
which
congress
has,
quote,
created
a
concrete
private
interest
in
the
outcome
of
a
suit
for
the
government's
benefit
by
providing
a
cash
bounty
for
the
victorious
plaintiff.
and
the...
that
concrete
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
suit,
the
prospect
of
recovering
is
sufficient
to
create
an
interest.
of
course,
the
united
states
was
injured
by
the...
or
allegedly
injured
by
the
violation
of
the
false
claims
act.
so,
there
was
an
injury
in
fact,
and
the
false
claims
act
operates,
in
effect,
as
an
assignment
or
in
the
nature
of
an
assignment.
and
under...
under
vermont's
theory,
no
assigned
claim
could
be
brought
under
article
iii
because
the
assignor
was
the
injured
party,
but
the
person
bringing
the
suit
was
not.
but
it
is
commonplace
under
our
system
of
justice
for
claims
to
be
able
to
be
assigned.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
united
states
does
not
commonly
assign
its
claims,
but
the
qui
tam
mechanism
has
been
around
since
1790
and
operates
in
very
much
the
same
way.
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
has
done
it
on
a
few
occasions.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
sequoia
orange
was
an
instance
in
which
the
united
states
intervened
not
at
the
outset
but...
but
later
down
the
road
and
dismissed
the
case
because
of
concern
that
the
qui
tam
suit
was
continuing
to
upset
that...
that
particular
sector
of
the
agricultural
economy
in
california.
and
the
ninth
circuit
held...
and
the
court
below
in
this
case
agreed
with
the
proposition...
that
the
united
states
can
intervene
and
dismiss
a
case
for
any
reason
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose,
as
that
one
was.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
about
the
article
iii--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
just...
my
point
here
simply
goes
to
the
article
iii
point
not
the...
not
the
eleventh--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
think
if
there
is
a
complete
assignment
of
a
claim,
taking
it
out
of
the...
of
the
qui
tam
situation
for
a
moment,
but
an
assignment
of
a
commercial
claim,
i...
i
think
that
the
eleventh
amendment
might
well
pose
a
bar.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
because
a
qui
tam
action
is...
is
a
hybrid
form
of
action
that
has
been
in
existence
since
the
beginning
of
the
nation.
the
united
states,
particularly
under
the
false
claims
act,
retains
an
interest
and
retains
the
ability
to
come
into
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we're...
we're
not...
we're
not
saying
it's
literally
an
assignment.
all
we're
saying
is
that
in
response
to
the
article
iii
argument,
that
the
article
iii
argument,
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
would
mean
that
an
assigned
claim
could
not
be
brought.
and
while
the
united
states
has
not
often
assigned
its
claims
outside
of
this
area,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
property
clause
of
the
united
states
grants
the
congress
the
power
to
dispose
of
all
property
of
the
united
states,
and
that
would
include
a
show...
an
action.
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
power
exists
without
limitation.
so,
congress
has
to
be
able...
we
think
under
the
property
clause,
to
be
able
to
assign
a
cause
of
action
just
as
any
private
litigate
might.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
think
as...
as
long
as
the
qui
tam
relator
gets
something,
he
has
a
concrete
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
the
fact
that
the
united
states
also
gets
something...
in
fact,
the
bulk
of
the
recovery...
shows
why
the...
why
the
united
states
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
case,
but
it
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
the
qui
tam
relator
has
a
concrete
interest.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
is
only
one...
there
is
only
one
judgment
in
a
qui
tam
case.
there
is
one
judgment
and
the
statute
provides
then
that
the
relator
recovers
his
share
out
of
the
proceeds
of
that...
of
that
action,
in
other
words,
out
of
the
judgment
that
is
rendered
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
there
are
not
two
separate
causes
of
action.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
before
i
move
on
from
article
iii
standing
is
that
this
court's
modern
standing
jurisprudence
has
been
an
effort
to
apply
the
case
or
controversy
principles
in
the
new
context
of
modern
public
law
litigation.
but
the...
the
ultimate
inquiry
is
what
is
a
case
or
controversy.
those
are
the
constitutional
terms.
and
on
that
point,
we
think
it's
critical
to
look
what
the
founders
meant
by
those
terms.
and
in
fact,
just
several
terms
ago
in
the
steel
company
case,
the
court
said
that
a
case
or
controversy
means
cases
and
controversies
of
the
sort
traditionally
amenable
to
and
resolved
by
the
judicial
process.
and
that
classically
describes
qui
tam
actions
which
were
in
existence
both
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
after.
and
the
case
or
controversy
provision
in
article
iii
was
intended
to
have
continuity.
it
is
not,
for
example,
like
marbury
v.
madison
which
involved
a...
a
new
structural
feature
of
our
constitution.
it...
it
refers
to
provisions
of
the
constitution
in
which
the
framers
intended
continuity.
on...
on
the
statutory
point,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
there
is
no
clear
statement
requirement
in
a
situation
involving
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
a
state.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
abrogated
a
state's
sovereign
immunity
on
behalf
of
a
private
person.
the
false
claims
act
is
fundamentally
a
statute
that
regulates
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
a
state.
a
relator,
in
some
circumstances,
is
permitted
to
bring
an
action
to
invoke
the
united
states'
cause
of
action
to
recover
from
the
defendant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
if
there
is
a
qui
tam
action.
but
my...
my
point
is
that
the...
that
the
definition
of
person
is...
is
important
first
of
all
in
section
3729
of
the
act
which
is
not
the
suit
filing
provision
of
the
act.
that's
3730.
3729
of
the
act
is
what
defines
the
liability
of
a...
of
any
person
to
the
united
states.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
1986
amendment
shows
quite
clearly...
clearly
that
congress
anticipated
that
states
would
be
proper
defendants.
while
it
may
have
been
described
in
the
background
section
of
the...
of
the
committee
report,
as
justice
breyer
explained,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
1986
amendments
was
to
round
out
and
reinforce
and
to...
and
to
make
effective
what...
what
congress
understood
the
present
regime
to
be.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we...
we
think
that
the
law
probably
did
apply
to
the
states
because
there
was
no
clear
statement
requirement.
now,
as
you
pointed
out,
there
may
not
have
been
many
instances
in
which
the
states
at
the
time
that
the
false
claims
act
was
enacted
would
be
getting
grants
of
this
sort,
but
of
course
that
had
become
commonplace
by
the
time
of
marcus
v.
hess.
it's
very
commonplace
today.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
i
know.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
no,
just
descriptive...
excuse
me...
descriptively.
but
in
19...
in
1986,
congress
was
revamping
the
statute
at
a
time
when
federal
grants
had
become
common.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
is
the
reason
why
i
think
it's
specific.
what
congress,
in
fact,
did
to
3729,
it
previously
read
a
person
not
in
the
military
is
liable
for
various
things.
well,
congress
repealed
that
paragraph
and
enacted
a
new
paragraph
which
said
any
person,
deleting
the
qualification
of
not
in
the
military,
which
might
be
an
awkward
way
to
describe
a
state--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
also
said
any
person.
any
person
is
usually
an
expansive
term,
and
there's
certainly
no
reason
to
think
that
it...
that
it
wasn't
to
be
expansive
here.
and
two
other
significant--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that's
typically
where
there
is
a
private
interest
at
stake.
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
petitioner
has
cited
no
case
where
the...
where
the
term
person
has
not
been
held
to
involve
a
state
where
there's
a
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
a
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
relator...
there
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
no
prior
injury
to
the
relator,
but
there
certainly
is
a
prior
injury
to
the
united
states.
and
as
i've
said,
the
statute
operates
in
the
nature
of
an
assignment.
the...
the
relator
is
given
the
opportunity
to
invoke...
to
redress
the
united
states'
injury,
but
also
given
his
own
standing,
because
once
he
files
the
suit,
he
has
in
a
sense
distinguished
himself
from
every
other
taxpayer
because
the
statute
gives
him
the
exclusive
right
to
see
the
case
through
to
judgment.
he
has
reduced
the...
this
free-floating
cause
of
action,
captured
it,
made
it
his
own,
and...
and
the
statute
then
gives
him
a
personal
right
and
a
personal--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
citizen
suit
cases,
it's...
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
the
plaintiff
to
be
able
to
bring
the
suit
because
of
a
personal
injury
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
private
plaintiff,
the
private
citizen.
but
the
relief
in
the
case
may
well
be
that
civil
penalties
awarded
to
the
united
states.
so,
the
relief...
the
relief
in
question...
and
it's
often...
in
brown
v.
board
of
education,
the
relief
awarded
went
beyond
relief
that
just
benefitted
the
individual
who
was
seeking
a
desegregated
school.
it
had
a
broader
ramification,
and
so
too
here.
but
the
fact...
the
fact
that
it
had--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
again,
there
is
a
single,
unitary
judgment
out
of
which
the...
the...
in
a
way
the
united
states
and
the
relator
in
that
way
could
be
looked
at
as
joint
tenants,
and
a...
and
a
joint
tenant
is
typically
empowered
to
protect
the
interests
on
behalf
of
both
tenants.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
these
are
just
analogies,
but
i
think
they
show
why
a
single
judgment
in
which
one
person
has
an
interest
was
enough
to
give
a...
a
concrete
stake.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
certainly
think
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that...
that
a
clear
statement
is
required
that's
not
for
the
relator...
that
wouldn't
be
true
for
the
united
states,
and
i...
but
that
would...
that
would
come
under
3730,
not
the
definition
of
person
but
who
could
bring
a
cause
of
action
under
3730(a)
or
(b)
which
distinguished
the
attorney
general
and...
and
the
private
relator.
but
with
respect
to
the
word
person,
we
don't
think
that
that
makes
any
logical
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
we
think
that...
we
think
that's
a
particular
reason
why
the
idea
that
the
statute
should
be
saved
by
construing
states
not
to
be
persons,
it
would
be
an
odd
sort
of
saving
of...
saving
construction
to
deprive
the
united
states
of
suing
states
when
states
receive
250
billion
a
year
now.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
congress
specifically
determined
in
1986
that
those
other
remedies
were
inadequate
and
that
the
false
claims
act
measures,
including
the
provisions
for
informers
to
bring
information
to
the
united
states
or
to...
to
file
suit
were
critical
to
ferret
out
and...
and
redress.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that...
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that...
that
concern
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
itself
should
be
able
to
bring
a
false
claims
act--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
again,
your
concern
goes
i...
i
thought
primarily
to
the
question
of
the
qui
tam
provision.
that's
different
from
the
united
states.
if
the
united
states
is
bringing
the
suit,
it
can...
it
can
exercise
all
appropriate
cautions.
i
wanted
to
just...
several
things
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
if
i
may.
new
hampshire
v.
louisiana
i
think
is
the
principal
case
where
the
court
found
that
there
was
an
eleventh
amendment
bar
because
the
state
was
not
the
real
party
in
interest,
even
though
nominally
the
plaintiff.
the...
the
claim
was
really
being
brought
on
behalf
of
private
individuals.
and
here
i
think
we
have
really
the
reverse
situation
where
the
relator
is
really
representing
the
interests
of
the
united
states
in
a
lawsuit,
but
the
united
states
is
substantially
a
real
party
in
interest
in
the
case.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
because
there
was
a...
a
private
party
that
stood
behind
the
state
that...
that
stood
to
benefit,
and
here
we
have
very
much
the
same
thing,
that
although
the
relator
brings
the
suit,
he
first
of
all
brings
it
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
recover
for
the
united
states.
and
the
united
states
stands
behind
the
relator,
although
the
relator
has
a
personal
interest...
stands
behind
the
relator
as
a
real
party
in
interest
in
the
lawsuit.
and
the
relator's
interest
in
this
case
is
derivative.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
alden
v.
maine
or
blatchford
where
the
plaintiff
was
suing
to
vindicate
an
injury
to
himself.
the
plaintiff's
interest
in
this
lawsuit
is
entirely
derivative
of
that
of
the
united
states.
and
the...
a
false
claims
act
suit,
whether
brought
by
the
relator
or
brought
by
the
united
states,
retains
its
public
character
throughout.
the
united
states...
the
attorney
general
is
always
able
to
intervene
in
the
case,
to
take
it
over,
to
get
pleadings,
to
intervene
and
dismiss
it.
her
settlement...
or
her
approval
is
required
for
settlement.
this
is
control
over
the
suit
that
preserves
political
accountability
in
the
united
states
in
the...
in
the
federal
government
for
the
processing
of
the
suit,
but
if
the
attorney
general
decides
not
to
take
over
the
suit,
the
suit
can
proceed
within
the
parameters
that
congress
has
prescribed
and
that
the
attorney
general
provides
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
a
suit
both
by
the...
it's
a
hybrid
by
the
united
states
and
by
the
relator.
