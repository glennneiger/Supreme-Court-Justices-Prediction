unknown
speaker
we
asked
you
to
brief
the
additional
issue.
i
think
you're
perfectly
free
to
argue
it.
we
didn't
ask
you
to
argue
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i
guess
we've
had
some
form
of
qui
tam
suits
authorized
by
congress
since
the
earliest
days,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
perhaps
authorizing
them
in...
in
circumstances
where
the
relator
would
not
have
an
injury
in
fact,
as
we
know
it.
unknown
speaker
the
early
statutes?
unknown
speaker
because
the
relator
would
have
suffered
an
injury
in
fact?
unknown
speaker
is
the
fact
that
this
qui
tam
relator
entitled
to
some
portion
of
the
recovery
at
the
end
of
the
day...
does
that
make
it
a
sort
of
bounty?
unknown
speaker
the
bounty...
the
bounty
cases
you
were
referring
to
i
take
it
are
cases
in
which
the...
the
suit
may
be
initiated
by
the...
or
was
the
suit
initiated
by
the
bounty
receiver
or
it's
just
that
if
he
brought
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
government,
the
government
would
sue,
and
at
the
end
of
the
suit
he'd
get
a
bounty?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
were
some.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
common
law
background
too.
if...
if
you...
if
you...
we're
trying
to
fathom
what
was
the
original
understanding
of
standing.
the
common
law
suit
could
be
initiated
by
the...
by
the
private
person.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
common
law
doesn't...
doesn't
necessarily
prove
anything.
i
mean,
at
common
law,
i...
i
suppose
all
sorts
of
things
occurred
which
would
violate
the
new
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
that
the
federal
government
adopted.
i
presume
at
common
law
you
could
have
had
the
decision
of...
of
the
supreme
court
overruled
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
actually
was
a
qui
tam
statute
enacted
by,
say,
the
first
congress,
that
would
be
some
indication
that
the
first
congress,
which
had
a
number
of
members
from
the
constitutional
convention
in
it,
thought
that
a
qui
tam
statute
met
the
requirements
of
article
iii.
unknown
speaker
well,
unless
it
shows
that
our
irreducible
minimum
isn't
consistent
with
the
understanding
of
the
framers.
maybe
the
framers
hadn't
read
lujan.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
first
congress
also
pass
the
statute
that
was
stricken
down
in
marbury
v.
madison?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
they
hadn't
read
marbury
v.
madison
either,
had
they?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
malley,
may
i
just
go
back
with
a
technical
question
to
your...
your
point
earlier
that
until
the
action
was
filed,
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
has
no
greater
interest
than...
than
any
taxpayer?
my
technical
question
is
this.
if
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
gives
what
i
guess...
it's
the
60-day
notice
of
an
intent
to
commence
such
a
suit
and
during
that
period,
the
united
states
decides
that...
the
justice
department
decides
that
it
in
fact
will
initiate
the
action,
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
government
wins
the
case,
does
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
get
anything?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
the
statute
provide?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
assuming
the
government
never
intervenes,
as
it
has
a
right
to
do
in
one
of
these
actions,
would
it
be
res
judicata
on
the
government
afterwards?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
talk
about
that
because
i
think
we've
injected
you
into
this
whole
issue
that
you've
been
talking
about
after
the...
the
petition
was
filed.
are
you
going
to
address
those
issues
of
whether
the
state
is
a
person
and
the
eleventh
amendment
concerns?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
this
is...
this
is
on
interlocutory
posture,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
normally
we
wouldn't
take
jurisdiction
over
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
we
didn't
answer
it,
but
suggested
that
we
hadn't
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
can...
i
can
accept
that
as
a
possibility,
but...
but
not
perhaps
going
to
the
statutory
issue.
why
is
it
intertwined?
why
do
we
have
to
resolve
the
statutory
issue
in
order
to...
in
order...
i
mean,
the
fact
is
you...
you
have
a
state
as
a
defendant.
you
have
a
private
party
as...
as
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly...
certainly
we
also
have
a...
a
practice
we
don't
go
to
constitutional
issues
if
we
don't
have
to.
and
as
you
suggest,
there
you
can
argue
that
the
statutory
issue
should
come
before
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
at
any
rate.
if
congress
didn't
intend
to
make
states
liable
under
qui
tam,
you
don't
get
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
understand
that,
but...
but
just...
just
to
get
the
record
straight,
do
you
know
of
any
case
where,
in
order
to
avoid
a
constitutional
issue,
we
have
ignored
a
jurisdictional
question
and
jumped
straight
to
the
statutory
question
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
which
was
a
jurisdictional
one?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
none.
unknown
speaker
many
of
our
jurisdictional
questions
are
constitutional
questions.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
on
eleventh
amendment
jurisdiction,
we
usually
ask
whether
there's
a
clear
statement
or
not
first,
and
if
no
clear
statement,
then
we
don't...
don't
reach
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
isn't
that
our
practice?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
much
the
same
thing,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
same
kind
of
statutory
question.
what's
a
person?
unknown
speaker
one
thing
we
know
for
sure
is
you
only
have
half
an
hour
to
argue.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is...
is
there
an
argument
here
that
whatever
the
force
of
your
position
is,
it
has
been...
it
has
been
waived
contractually?
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
of
vermont,
of
course,
had
an
express
contract
with
the
united
states
and
that
contract
provided
that
it
was...
that
the
united
states,
as
a
contracting
party,
would
have
all
the...
i
think
the
phrase
was
all
the
rights
provided
by
law,
which
i
suppose
would
be
enough
to
include
the
qui
tam
statute.
would
that
be
sufficient
to
effect
a
waiver
of
whatever
eleventh
amendment
defense
the
united...
the
state
of
vermont
might
otherwise
have?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
is...
this
is
a
step
beyond
mere
participation.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
an
agreement,
as
i
understand
it,
to
submit
oneself
to
the...
the
state
to
submit
itself
to
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
united
states
statutes
and...
and
the
qui
tam
statute
is
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
assume...
we
assume
we've
got
over
the
person
issue
in
order
to
get
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
unknown
speaker
so,
we'll
assume
that
person
does
include
the
state.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
the
point
of
my
question
was
that
the
statute
provides,
in
fact,
for
a...
a
remedy
at
the
behest
of
exactly
the
kind
of
plaintiff
that
we
have
here.
and
if
that
is
part
of
the
remedial
scheme
to
which
the
individuals
seem
to
agree
in
the
statute...
in
the
contract,
why
doesn't
the
contract
effect
a
waiver
of
whatever
eleventh
amendment
immunity
might
otherwise
be
asserted?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
a...
that's
a
rule...
that's
a
rule
of
legislation.
we're
talking
here
about
a
contractual
provision.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the...
the
uncertainty
about
what
person
means
would...
would
be,
in
effect,
to
the
failure
to...
to
make
its
position--
unknown
speaker
--did...
did
the
respondent
rely
on--
--did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
the
contractual
ground?
unknown
speaker
did
the...
did
the
respondent
raise
the
contractual
point
as
a
alternate
ground
for
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
contract
say,
by
the
way?
i
don't...
i
don't
even
know
what
it
said.
did
it
say
we...
we
agree
to
all
remedies
that
anybody
may
have
or
to
any
remedies
that
the
united
states
may
have?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
the
state
can't
be
a
defendant,
it
also
can't
be
a
plaintiff,
or
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
those
two?
unknown
speaker
mr.
malley,
can
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
i
understand
that
there
is
a
difference.
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
do
you
think
vermont
could
bring
a
suit
as
a
plaintiff,
as
you
understand
the
statute
today?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what's
your
answer
to
the
question?
[laughter]
do
you
think
vermont
could
bring
a
suit
or
not
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
no?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
no.
okay.
has
vermont
ever
brought
a...
a
suit
under
the
false
claims
act?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
indication
of
how
many
of
these
false
claims
act
suits
the
united
states
itself
has
initiated
against
states,
if
any,
as
distinguished
from
the
qui
tam?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
malley.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
you're
counting...
you're
counting
those...
those
situations
where
the
suit
is
not
brought
by
the
individual,
but
he
just
gets
a
bounty?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
consider
that
qui
tam.
i
mean,
that's...
that's--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
addressing
the
eleventh
amendment
question
or
the
statutory
question
right
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
trust
you
will
get
to
the
statutory
question
somewhere
in
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
could
apply...
that
could
apply
in
the
case
where
there's
a
suit
against
a
private
contractor
and
the
state
has
some
records.
unknown
speaker
but
it
just
says
in
3733,
definitions,
for
purposes
of
this
section.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
didn't
see
that
it
extended
to
the
whole
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
anything
but
a
clear
statement--
unknown
speaker
--well,
are
you
saying
then
that
congress
extended
it
to
the
states
sometime
recently
or
in
1860,
whenever
it
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
it's
only
by
virtue
of
the
amendment
that
your...
your
position
would
prevail.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there...
if--
unknown
speaker
--just
a
minute,
mr.
olson.
if...
if
there
was
no
clear
statement
in
1863...
and
i...
i
have
a
feeling
then
that
the
states
weren't
getting
much
from
the
federal
government
the
way
they
are
today.
there
would
be
less
reason
for
it...
then
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
that
without
the
amendment,
your
position
would...
would
fail?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
how
the
cid
section...
i
mean
i
see
that
it
helps
you,
but
it
seems
far
from
conclusive.
as
i
get
it,
it
just
says
whenever
the
ag
has
reason
to
believe
any
person...
that
includes
a
state...
may
be
in
possession
of
any
documentary
information,
et
cetera,
relevant
to
a
false
claims
law
investigation...
and
that
includes
the
sections
you
define...
he
has
to
turn
it
over.
if
states
have
information,
they
have
to
turn
it
over.
that
doesn't
mean
they
should
be
defendants.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
it's
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--the...
the
report
they
say,
which
is
i
think
correct,
that
that's
in
a
background
section
and
that
that
report
purports
to
be
telling
what
the
human
being
who
wrote
that
report
thought
the
law
was
before
these
amendments.
of
course,
that
person
was
wrong.
that
isn't
what
the
law
was,
as
you've
said,
or
at
least
it
isn't
very
persuasive.
and
so,
why
would
a
statement
in
a
background
section
show
that
what
congress
intends
to
do
is
to
change
that
substance
rather
than
just
show
congress
intends
to
pick
up
whatever
the
law
was
before?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
they...
if
they
had
flagged
it
as
a
change,
they
would
have
gotten
a
lot
of
testimony
from
states
i
guess
who
might
have
been
opposed
to
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
they
might
have.
unknown
speaker
when...
when
a
person
writes
in
a
background
section
this
is
the
law,
we're
not
making
a
change,
then
it
tends
to
pass
unnoticed.
unknown
speaker
your
position
seems
to
require
quite
a
few
props.
unknown
speaker
not
all
of
which
goes
to
the
united
states.
so,
why
can't
you
say
it's
a
suit
by
the
united
states
insofar
as
the...
the
reward
that
goes
to
the
united
states
is
concerned?
but
it
is
not
a
suit
against...
brought
by
the
united
states
to
the
extent
that
the
recovery
goes
to
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
but
this
isn't
an
intervenor.
i
mean,
this...
this
is
the
person
who
initiates
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
it
seems
to
me,
when...
when
all
you
have
before
you
is
that
person,
the
question
is
who
is
the
real
party
in
interest
as
to
that
person's
suit.
i
mean,
it's
obvious
who
the
real
party
in
interest...
he's
looking
to
get
the
reward.
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
you
say
there
is
only
one
cause
of
action,
then
i'm
not
sure
that
helps
you.
i
mean,
if...
if...
it
seems
to
me
all
of
the
one
cause
of
action
has
to
be
by
the
united
states--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
any
of...
if
any
of
the
cause
of
action
is
not
by
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me
maybe
the
whole
thing
falls.
i
can
see
you're
splitting
into
two
and
saying
the
united
states'
portion
is
okay.
but
if
it's
all
going
to
be
one,
why
should
i
accept
your
view
that
it's
the
united
states
who
should
be
deemed
to
be
the
only
person
there,
even
though
there
are
really
two
people
in
interest
there?
why
should
i
accept
your
view
that
the
united
states
should
be
deemed
to
be
the
one
rather
than...
than
the--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
cases...
maybe
just
one
or
two...
do
you
rely
on
for
that...
for
that
real
party
in
interest
proposition
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
all
i
was
asking
was
for
one
or
two.
unknown
speaker
it
involves
who
the
defendant
is,
who's
the
real
party
in
interest
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
yes.
right?
unknown
speaker
those...
those
are
original
jurisdiction
cases
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
the
eleventh
amendment
cases
that...
that
you
rely
on?
you
said
that
the
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
provides.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
is
it
that
the
united
states,
under
your
rule,
can
bring
an
action
on
behalf
of
an
employee
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
without
an
eleventh
amendment
violation?
isn't
the
employee
under
your
rule
the
real
party
in
interest?
unknown
speaker
if...
if
the
united
states
brings
an
action
for
an
employee
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
who
is
the
real
party
in
interest
under
your
test?
unknown
speaker
but
the
whole
name
of
actions
comes
from
the
latin
which
says
who
on
his
own
behalf
as
well
as
on
the
part
of
the
king.
i
mean,
in
the
very
title
of
these
actions--
unknown
speaker
--it
indicates
that
the
suit
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
individual
bringing
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
interest
in
the
outcome.
i
say
he
brought
the
suit
on
his
own
behalf.
unknown
speaker
and
also
on
behalf
of
the
king.
that's
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
these
actions
are.
they're
brought
on
behalf
of
the
individual
and
on
behalf
of...
of
the
sovereign.
unknown
speaker
the
purpose
of
treble
damage--
--thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
it
commonplace
for
the
united
states
to
assign
its
claims?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
this
other
question.
has
the
united
states
often
terminated
actions
brought
by
qui
tam
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
if
it
is
a
straight
assignment,
suppose
the
united
states
just
assigns
a
claim
to
smith,
a
claim
against
a
state.
is
it
clear
whether
smith
is
or
isn't
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
mean,
can
you
have
it
both
ways?
that
is,
if--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
so,
i
do
too.
so,
under
those
circumstances
then,
how
can
you
have
it
both
ways?
unknown
speaker
your
view
would
be
for
purposes
of
standing,
an
assignment;
for
purposes
of
eleventh
amendment,
not
an
assignment.
it's
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
that
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but...
but
that...
that
would...
that
would
only
cover
the
situation
where
all
the...
all
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
gets
is...
is
his
own
recovery
and
nothing
is...
is
then
credited
to...
to
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
you
need
standing.
i
mean,
the
concrete
interest
has
to
pertain
to
each
element
of
relief
that
you're...
that
you're
asking
for.
and
what
is
this--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's...
that's
not
quite
as
clear
as
you
make
it
i
think.
the...
the
action
can
proceed
without
the
united
states
ever
intervening,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
was
the
law
before
those
amendments
as
to
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
marcus
against
hess
didn't
amend
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
not
purportedly.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
were
revamping
the
statute,
why...
why
are
you
so
dependent
on
something
called
a
background
report
that,
as
justice
breyer
says,
can
probably
better
be
read
for
describing
existing
law?
unknown
speaker
it
might.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
we...
we've
had
cases
saying
that
person...
the
use
of
the
word
person
doesn't
ordinarily
include
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
here...
well,
let's...
let's
get
back
to
the...
the
relator.
what
is
the
relator's
injury
in
fact--
unknown
speaker
--until
the
time
the
suit
is
filed--
unknown
speaker
--that's
different
from
the
ordinary
taxpayer?
unknown
speaker
gives
him
a
personal
right
to...
to
his
portion
of
the
recovery,
but
that's...
we
don't
do
standing
in
gross
the
way
you're
describing
it.
so
long
as
he
has
standing
for
something,
he
has
standing
for
everything.
and
there's...
there's
no
way
to
see
how
he
has
standing
to
get
the
money
that's
going
to
go
to
somebody
else--
unknown
speaker
--namely
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
all
of
the
relief
awarded
benefitted
that
person.
it
may
have
benefitted
other
persons
as
well.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
adopt
in
any
way
as
a
fall-back
position
that
the
false
claims
act
includes
the
state
as
a
person
if
the
united
states
is
bringing
the
suit,
but
does
not
include
the
state
as
a
person
if
a
private
individual
is
bringing
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
because
you
did
say
in
your
brief
one
of
the
reasons
the
united
states
has
a
large
stake
in
this
is
that
the
united
states
itself
couldn't
sue
under
the
false
claims
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's--
--well,
presumably
the
united
states
has
an...
an
array
of
additional
remedies.
it's
not
like
the
state
is
going
to
get
away
with
something,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
very
point.
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
joint
programs
means
that
when
you
bring
the
states
in,
it
changes
the
nature
of
the
statute.
it's
one
thing
to
have
private
people,
you
know,
going
through
technical
violations
and
searching
the
books
of
private
companies.
it's
quite
another
to
set
loose
an
army
of
people
on
the
states
who
will
find
every
technical
violation
they
can
because
they
get
money
for
it.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
latter
should
be
left
to
the
political
process
or
other
methods,
not
this
one.
that's
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
you
take
the
word
person,
which
up
till
1986
has
in
practice
been
included
not
states,
and
then
just
say
that
a
background
statement
and
a
couple
of
other
little...
little
things
in
the
statute,
maybe
worth
an
ounce
each,
should
be
taken
to
work
what
i
would
characterize
pejoratively...
i
don't
really
mean
it...
as
a
kind
of
revolution
in
the
way
the
states...
potentially
a
revolution
in
the
way
that
the
states--
unknown
speaker
--there...
there
the...
the
finding
was
that
the
plaintiff
was...
was
not
the
real
party
in
interest.
unknown
speaker
it
still
remains
a
suit
by
the
united
states
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
malley,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
you
assign
a
claim
to
someone
who
has
no
prior
injury
and
they
can
bring
a...
they
can
bring
the
claim?
can't
they?
an
assignee
never
has
a
prior
injury.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
said
look
at
this
like
an
assignment.
unknown
speaker
what
about
his
example
of
a
joint
tenancy
where
two
parties
both
have
an
interest
in
a
unitary
judgment?
isn't
that
possible?
unknown
speaker
he
said
it's
comparable
to
a
joint
tenancy,
yes.
unknown
speaker
a
partial
assignment.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
the
government
has
75
percent
and
the
qui
tam
relator
has
25
percent.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
suggesting
an
assignee
could
never
sue
if...
if
the
assignee
had
never
been
injured.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
government
had
assigned
the
claim
in
toto
to
the
relator,
i
suppose
the
relator
could
sue
without
any
trouble
and
clearly
have
standing.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you
could
partially
assign
claims
anyway.
i
mean,
it
would
be
a
nice
way
to
harass
somebody,
you
know,
divvy
up
a
claim
against
somebody
into
100
pieces
and
give
them
to
100
different
people.
i
don't
think
it
is
doable.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
oclock.
