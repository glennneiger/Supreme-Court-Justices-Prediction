mr.
thomas
f.
gede
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
30
years
of
declining
voter
turn-out
in
primary
elections,
california
voters
have
acted
to
allow
millions
of
additional
voters
to
fully
participate
in
the
primary
election,
and
the
results
have
been
dramatic,
with
the
highest
voter
turn-out
in
16
years
in
the
last
gubernatorial
primary,
the
highest
in
20
years
in
this
year's
presidential
primary.
the
voters
acted
in
their
own
interest
to
increase
that
voter
participation
and
turn-out,
give
them--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--no.
the
fundamental
assumption
is,
the
election
belongs
to
the
voters.
it
belongs
to
the
individuals
who--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well,
that
is
precisely
what
the
open
primary
does.
it
allows
the
voters
to
decide
in
the
primary
election--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well,
prop
198
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--no,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor,
what's
remarkable
here
is
that
the
voters
decided
to
treat
the
primary
election
as
an
election.
it
is
where
they
decide
to
vote
on
the
candidates
that
go
to
office
and
represent
them
in
the
statehouse,
or
the
governor--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
what
we're
allowing
voters
to
do
is
select
their
candidates
for
office.
the
nominees
belong--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--the
candidates
carry--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--certainly,
justice
scalia.
if
you
have
a
nonpartisan
ballot,
it
is
a
lesser
burden
on
the
parties
than
any
other
form
of
primary
here,
but
in
answering
both
justice
o'connor
and
justice
ginsburg,
or
justice
ginsburg's
questions
about
whether
an
open
primary
is
any
different
than
a
blanket
primary
here,
in
reality
what
you're
talking
about
is
23
states
of
the
union
don't
even
have
a
requirement
of
voter
affiliation.
an
individual
voter
can
walk
into
the
poll
and
say,
i
think
i'll
be
a
republican
today,
or
i
think
i'll
be
a
democrat
today.
there's
no
requirement,
in
most
of
these
states
that
have
open
primaries,
any
differently
than
a
blanket
primary
state
to
affiliate
right
on
the
spot
and
have
some
sort
of
act
that
says,
i'm
a
republican.
the
candidate
carries
the
ballot.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
that's
correct,
because
it's
as
if
each
race
is
a
separate--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--individual
ballot.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--not
in
any
open
primary
in
which
they
don't
even
have
to
indicate
what
their
preference
is
or
what
their
affiliation
is.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
the
state's
interest
is
what
the
voters
themselves
expressed
they
wanted.
a
majority
of
voters,
including
the
rank
and
file
of
the
republicans
and
democrats,
impressive
majorities
of
republicans
and
democrats,
and
probably
minor
party
voters
as
well,
all
said,
we
want
greater
choice
on
the
ballot.
we
want
greater
turn-out.
1.5
million
independent
voters
now
have
the
opportunity
to
vote
in
the
primary
election.
it's...
it
necessarily
increases
the
base
and
the
appeal--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--i'm
sorry
if
i
misstated--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--the
interest
is,
indeed,
compelling.
the
interest
is
to
provide
a
broader
base
for
the
candidates
to
appeal
to.
the
voters
get
greater
choice.
they
bring
in
1.5
million
additional,
independent
voters.
they
get
more
competitive
elections
as
a
result.
there's
a
greater
representativeness
among
those
candidates
in
the
elected
officials
and,
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
is
not
saying
on
any
basis
of
ideology
or
viewpoint.
it's
simply...
it's
just
civics.
the
more
people
you
have
voting,
the
more
representative
the
candidates
are
going
to
be.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
the
voters
knew
instinctively
that
bringing
in
more
voters,
including
all
of
the
independents
in
california,
the
fastest-growing
bloc
of
voters,
was
that
they
were
going
to
get
candidates
that
were
more
representative
of
their
points
of
view.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
pulls
it
to
the
middle.
what's--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--what's--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--no,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
there's
no
content
to
this
at
all.
what's
representative
in
san
francisco
is
not
going
to
be
what's
representative
in
orange
county.
it
simply
means
that
more
voters
that
get
to--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
souter.
i
think
all
the
more
that's
happening
is
independent
voters,
and
voters
are
stepping
forward
and
indicating
their
choice
for
the
office.
the
political
parties
are
not
private,
autonomous
organizations.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
justice
scalia,
there
is
nothing
constitutionally
suspect
about
the
majority...
majoritarian
rule
here.
the
greater
number
of
voters--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--that's
right.
this
is
an
election--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well,
justice
scalia,
this
is
the
election
that
belongs
to
the
voters
in
which
the
first
cut,
when
candidates
are
narrowed,
these
candidates
will
be
their
elected
representatives
in
the
statehouse,
or
for
governor.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
yes,
justice--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
what
this
court
has
done
in
timmons
is
established
a
balancing
test
that
looks
at
those
important
and
legitimate
first
amendment
interests
of
the
political
parties
and
balances
them
against
the
legitimate
interests
of
the
state.
in
this
case,
it's
the
voters,
the
voters
themselves.
this
isn't
a
classic
case
of
the
state
trenching
on--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--it
has
the
right
to
do
just
what
justice
kennedy
suggested,
call
for
and
endorse
before
the
primary
or
at
any
point
whatsoever,
an
endorsement
of
the
central
committee,
or
whatever
the
current
party
leadership
chooses
to
do,
but
the
voters
are
themselves
participating
in
the
election
process.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
certainly.
under
you...
this
court
has
already
said
the
party
is
free
to--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well,
in
this
case
you
have
the
voters
themselves,
many
of
whom
are
party
members,
many
of
whom
are
independents
who
want
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
that
narrowing
process.
the
election
in
their
view
belongs
to
them.
when
they
voted
on
prop
198
they
knew
that
closed
primaries
were
not
working
in
california.
they
were
contributing
to
lower
voter
turnout,
alienation,
gridlock.
they
knew
instinctively
that--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well,
it
was--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--what
they
knew...
what
they
knew,
justice
scalia,
was
that
it
was
contributing
to
excessive
partisanship,
and
partisan
strife,
and
that
has
contributed
to
alienation
and
has...
and
it
has
resulted
in
30
years
of
decreased
participation
in
voter
turn-out.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
i
think
this...
i
think
prop
198,
by
making
the
elected
representatives
more
representative
of
the
voters
in
their
district
will
mean
that
the...
that
those
who
do
go
to
the
statehouse
are
going
to
be
clearly
more
accountable
to
the
voters.
the
voters
want
their
elected
officials
to
be
accountable.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
well,
if
it's--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
understand
what
is
undemocratic
about--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--justice
scalia,
just...
judge
levy
below
balanced
the
interest
and
looked
at
what
kind
of
burdens
are
put
on
the
political
parties
by
any
cross-over
voting
and
found
those
burdens
not
to
be
severe.
he
had
expert
testimony
based
on
the
solid
experience
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
state
of
alaska,
political
scientists
and
experts
who
came
to
the
court
and
said,
well,
this
is
what
the
burden
is,
and
the
burden
was
found
to
be
minor.
the
burden
was
found
not
to
be
significant
to
the
degree
that
it
was
severe.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
the
principal
burden
that
i
think
judge
levy
found
was
significant
was
that
it
would
have
a
dampening
effect
on
the
disciplining
by
the
party,
the
party
officials,
the
party
leadership,
on
those
legislators
who
go
off
with
a
charter,
with
a
more
representative
charter
to,
say,
the
statehouse,
and
he
said
that
that
is
a
burden.
it
is
significant.
this
is
a
balancing
that
this
court
has
applied,
but
it
is
not
a
severe
burden.
it
has
a
dampening
effect.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--right.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
there
will
be
races
that
will
be
determined
by
cross-over
vote,
whether
cross-over--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
yes.
the
voters
expected
and
anticipated
cross-over
votes
would
make
a
difference.
independents
and
even
people
from
the
other
party
voting
for
a
candidate
at
their
first
choice,
they're
voting
for
the
candidate
that
they
want.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
potentially.
the
court
found
that
generally
it
only
affected
the
margin
of
outcome,
and
not
the
outcome
itself,
but
that
shouldn't
make
any
constitutional
difference,
because
the
voters
are
voting
for
the
candidates
they
want
to
go
on
to
office,
and
the
burden
on
the
parties
was
not
severe,
and
the
interests
here
were
compelling,
getting
more
people
to
the
polls.
those
ballots
also
have
nonpartisan
races,
judicial
confirmations,
bond
issues,
all
kinds
of
things
on
them.
we
have
a
solid
and
important
and
compelling
interest
in
bringing
more--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--justice
breyer,
that's
no
different
in
a
closed
primary
in
california
than
under
a
blanket
or
an
open.
it's
a
self-selecting
system.
anybody
can
run
for
office
and
say
i'm
a
republican
and
get
their
name
on
the
ballot,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
party,
if
the
party--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--organization
doesn't
like
that
candidate--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--sure.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
certainly.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
certainly.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
the
burden
is
no
different
for
them
than
it
is
for
a
major
party.
if
their
interest
is
in
getting
somebody
elected
to
office,
what
burden
is
it
for
them...
this
is
an
opportunity
for
them.
they
get
more
support.
they
have
a
platform
for
greater
visibility.
they
have
the
opportunity
to
appeal
to
a
broader
constituency.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
justice
breyer,
the
small
parties
are
getting
the
votes
of
people
who
sincerely
want
that
candidate.
if
that
candidate
wins
in
the
election
as
a
nominee
of
the
libertarian
party,
that
candidate
won
precisely
because
that
candidate
attracted
the
votes
to
it,
people
who
now,
whether
it's
a
marginal
affiliation
or
not,
decide,
you
know,
i'm
really
a
libertarian
when
it
comes
to
that
office,
and
i
want
that
candidate
for
office.
and
so
what's
the
burden
there?
it's
neither
a
burden
on
their
desire
to
expand
their
base
and
become...
and
eventually
win,
which
is
one
of
their
goals,
nor
is
it
even
a
burden
on
their
expressive
rights,
their
willingness
to...
their
desire
to
get
their
message
across.
if
they're
solely
there
for
an
expressive
purpose,
then
why
are
they
doing
that
at
public
expense
on
a
public
ballot?
the
elections
are
not
solely
for
expression.
ballots
aren't
fora
for
expression.
they're
to
get
people
elected
to
office.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
well,
justice
scalia,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
either.
i
mean,
clearly
on
both
campaigns
and
in
elections
there
are
elements
of
expression
and
there
are
elements
of,
importantly,
getting
officials
elected
to
office,
but
ballots--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
because,
justice
scalia,
this
case
is
not
like
tashjian.
there,
one
party
was
in
power
and
actually
ganged
up
on
another
power,
and
your
powerful
dissent
went
to
the
state's
power
to
protect
the
party
in
that
particular
situation.
this
isn't
that.
this
is
where
this...
the
voters
have
decided
they
want
to
open
up
all
of
the...
this
is
all
of
the
parties,
all
of
the
voters,
every
demographic
subgroup,
majorities
all
across
the
board
say,
we
want
the
chance
to
vote
in
our
primary
election,
in
the
first
cut
of
the
election,
for
those
who
are
going
to
go
off
and
represent
us,
and--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--i
think
that
would
fall
squarely
under
tashjian
and
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
well,
it
doesn't
say
it
expressly,
but
if
you
look
at
tashjian
i
think
it...
it's...
what
it's
doing
is,
it's
employing
the
same
test--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--it
is
a
slightly
different
situation,
justice
scalia,
and
this
court
basically
used
the
test
that
eventually
emerged
in
timmons.
it
derived
from
burdick,
it
derived
from
anderson
v.
celebrezze,
and
you
look
to
those
burdens
and
see
whether
those
burdens
could
be
justified
or
outweighed
by
any
state
interest.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
no,
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference
here,
but
what
is
different
here
is
that,
where
the
voters
acted
in
their
own
first
amendment
interest
you
don't
have
the
classic
case
of
the
state
trenching
upon
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
party.
you
have
the
first
amendment
interests
of
the
voters
competing
with
the
first
amendment
interests
of
the
political
parties,
and
when
those
two
sets
of
first
amendment
interests
are
in
equipoise,
as
the
nyu
brennan
center
amicus
brief
put
it,
they
really
shouldn't
be
disturbed.
they
are
first
amendment
interests
that
are
shared
by
all,
and--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--yes,
justice--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--the
voters
here
spoke
to
it,
and
the...
and--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--no.
the
legislature--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--no.
the
legislature
clearly
can
represent
the
will
of
the
people,
particularly
when
it
is
representative
of
their
views.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
no.
i'm
sorry
if
it
came
out
wrong,
but
i
believe
that
it
should
not
make
any
constitutional
difference
whether
this
was
passed
by
initiative
or
by
the
legis--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--no,
your
honor.
i
thought
the
hypothetical
was,
if
one
party
in
power
imposed
a
restriction
on
the
other
party--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--right.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
hypothetical
from
justice
breyer,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
was
that
the
restriction
would
be
on
just
one
party.
in
this
case,
it
opens
up
and
expands
and
permits
all
parties,
all
voters
to
participate
in
the
primary
election.
it's
not
a
burden
on
one
party
or
the
other.
it
is
nondiscriminatory.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
well,
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--justice
scalia,
the
effect
of
the
legislative
decision
in
tashjian
was
to
hobble
the
other
party.
the
other
party
wanted
to
expand
its
base
of
membership,
it
wanted
to
attract
the
independents,
and
the
party
in
power
in
the
legislature
was
saying,
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
well,
the
primary,
justice
scalia,
is,
as
this
court
has
said,
an
important
first
cut,
integral
part
of
the
electoral
process
in
which
people
elect
their
candidates
to
office,
and
they
become
governor,
and
they
become
their
legislative
representatives,
and
they
become
their
members
of
congress.
why
are
we
allowing
the
party
tail
to
wag
the
dog?
this
is
about
elections,
and
this
is
about
the
voters
having
the
right
to
elect
the
candidates
for
office.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
again,
this
court
has
provided
a...
provided
a
construct
in
which
to
examine
that
in
the
test
that
it
has
in
timmons,
and
it
may
be
that
the
state
won't
have
compelling
enough
interests
to
overcome
whatever
burdens
would
be
placed
on
parties
in
the--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--it
may
well
be,
and--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--a
court
would
look--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--a
court
would
look
at
that
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
provided.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
yes.
in
california
the
initiative
is...
the
initiative
power
is
a
legislative
power,
and--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--the
courts
of--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--well,
i
don't
know
the
full
answer
to
that
question,
if
the
legislature
means
the
legislative
power,
or
if
it
means
the
body
in
which
the
elected
representatives
sit.
i
don't
have
an
answer
beyond
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
no,
of
course,
not,
to
my
knowledge.
i
don't
know
that
they
were--
mr.
thomas
f.
gede
--that's
correct,
also.
i
mean,
there
were
no
political
parties,
and
people
came
to
the
polls
and
elected
the
candidates
they
wanted
for
office.
in
sum,
if
i
may,
if
this
court
were
to
accept
the
petitioner's
argument
that
just
allowing
outsiders
in
were
to
severely
burden
the
party
to
the
degree
that
it's
unconstitutional,
this
total
party
autonomy
approach,
it
would
in
california,
as
professor
eugene
lee
has
pointed
out,
decrease
voter
turn-out
again,
it
would
increase
alienation
with
the
parties
and
the
party
leadership,
something
that's
already
there,
it
would
increase
the
independents
getting
a
larger
registration,
and
it
frankly
would
weaken
the
two-party
system.
more
importantly,
as
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier,
it
would
jeopardize
all
of
the
open
primaries
across
the
country,
and
primaries
that
allow
same-day
registration
and
states
that
don't
even
require
recordation,
or
allow
people
to
maintain
their
party
affiliation
in
private.
ultimately,
the
thrust
of
that
argument
is
down
the
slippery
slope
that
even
primaries
themselves
could
not
stand
up
against
that
argument
of
total
party
autonomy.
thank
you,
your
honor.
