so
if
the
state
required
the
tashjian
result,
you
would
say
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
you
make
any
argument
that
this
is
so
confusing
that
it's
detrimental
to
the
party?
let
me
ask
you
this:
there
were
some
22
or
23
different
names
listed
in
the
presidential
column
in
the
recent
primary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
the
order
of
the
names
selected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
can
find
a
libertarian,
a
democrat,
a
republican,
and
10
spaces
further
down
you
can
find
another
republican,
and
15
spaces
further
down
you
can
find
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
haven't
argued
that
this
confusion
dilutes
the
party
effectiveness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
that
true
in
this
case?
can't
the
parties,
by
pre-election
endorsements,
or
pre-election
criticism
or
disavowals,
make
their
party
position
known?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
be
their
choice.
if
there
were
two
people
that
were
qualified
libertarian,
then
the
libertarian
party
wouldn't
have
to
choose,
but
if
there
were
one
that
really
did
not,
in
the
party's
view,
represent
the
values
and
the
programs
of
the
party,
then
the
party
could
say
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
advance.
could
say,
we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
doesn't
that
cure
the
problem
that
you're
concerned
with?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
at
least
you
can
make
known
to
the
voters
that
you,
the
libertarian
party
in
the
hypothetical
case,
prefer
this
particular
candidate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
fundamental
assumption
of
the
amendment
that
it's
for
the
voters
to
tell
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
what
those
parties
should
stand
for?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
that's
different
from
the
postulate
i
suggested.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
the
theory
of
this
law
that
it's
for
the
voters
to
tell
the
republican
party
what
it
should
stand
for
in
the
state
of
california?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
allowing
an
ever-changing
galaxy
of
voters
in
a
particular
election
to
tell
the
party
who
its
representatives
must
be,
quite
without
respect
to
the
voter's
own
party
affiliation?
what's
the
state's
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
seems
to
me
almost
circular.
you're
saying
that
it's
constitutional
because
the
voters
want
it,
but
that's
not
usually
an
adequate
description
of
a
state
interest
when
the
state
is
regulating
or
interfering
or
restricting
associational
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
because
all
the
people
want
to
restrict
associational
rights,
that
seems
to
me
an
insufficient
state
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
the
objective
of
having
different
candidates
prevail
in
the
primary
the
precise
justification
for
this
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
this
constitutional
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
whole
purpose
was...
of
the
constitutional
amendment
is
to
nominate
different
people
than
would
have
been
nominated
otherwise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand.
the
first
amendment
operates
differently
if
the
statute
is
imposed
by
a
legislature
than
by
a
referendum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
the
legislature
doesn't
represent
the
will
of
the
people.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
that
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california,
the
legislature
can't
represent
the
will
of
the
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you're
telling
me
that
the
results
should
be
different,
depending
on
whether
there's
a
legislative...
whether
there's
a
statutory
or
constitutional
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then,
all
of
the
arguments
in
the
briefs
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
selected
this
are
irrelevant?
