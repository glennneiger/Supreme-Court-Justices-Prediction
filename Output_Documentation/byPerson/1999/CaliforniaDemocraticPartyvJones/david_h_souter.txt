justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
just
a
matter
of
degree,
because...
simply
because
the
decision
can
be
made
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
when
the
voter
gets
to
the
polls?
the
only
right
that
the
voter
has
in
the
open
primary
state
that
the
voter
does
not
have
in
the
blanket
primary
state
is
the
kind
of
mix-and-match
right.
if
the
voter
who
has
traditionally
been
either
not
registered,
or
registered
as
a
republican,
takes
a
democratic
ballot
in
the
open
primary
state,
there's
no
more
affiliation
between
that
voter
and
the
party
than
there
is
the
voter
who
under
the
blanket
system
chooses
to
vote
for...
in
the
democratic
primary
for
governor
and
the
republican
primary
for
state
treasurer.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a
pretty
empty
formality?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
take
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's
take
the
example
of
the
party
that
says,
we
want
our
affiliates
to
be
real
affiliates,
and
therefore
we
want
them
to
have
registered
as
such
at
least
6
months
before
the
primary,
or
2
months
before
the
primary,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
late
voter
registration
for
reasons
of
transience.
and
in
a
case
in
a
state
in
which
the
state
law
is,
well,
you
can't
require
a
30-day
affiliation,
you
can't
require
anything
more
than
the
instantaneous
affiliation,
isn't
the
sense
of
affiliation
just
as
ephemeral
there
as
is
the
sense
of
affiliation
between
in
a
blanket
primary
state
the
fellow
who
walks
in
and
says,
i
guess
i'll
vote
for
a
democrat
for
governor
and
a
republican
in
the
treasurer's
race?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
may
be
right
on
that,
in
which
case
i
take
it
your
argument
is,
look,
we're
going
to
operate
on
the
premise
that
an
affiliation,
even
a
last-minute
one,
is
at
least
a
bona
fide
affiliation
and
good
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
different
from
no
affiliation.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you...
is
it
a
consequence
of
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
that
a
state
really
can
do
by
way
of
ballot
access,
if
it's
clever
enough,
what
it
cannot
do
by
way
of
a
blanket
primary
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that
in
a
ballot
access...
that
it
had
a
ballot
access
law
saying,
we
will
let
the
top
four
vote-getters
in
the
primary,
without
reference
to
party
affiliation
we'll
let
the
top
four
vote-getters
in
the
primary
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
general
election.
i
take
it
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
is
that
a
state
may
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
wouldn't
the
result
in
practice
come
out
in
effect
to
a
series
of
choices
which
are
more
or
less
the
equivalent
of
what
the
voters
can
do
under
the
blanket
primary
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you...
it
boils
down
to
two
things.
the
state
cannot
in
effect
allow
a
person
to
say,
i
am
a
democrat,
when
there
has
been
no
act
of
affiliation
and,
number
2,
we
will
assume
that
acts
of
affiliation
are
basically
acts
in
good
faith.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
as
i
understand
your
position
to
be,
the
party
can
make
its
own
decision
about
what
affiliation
is
sufficient,
or
whether
it
requires
an
affiliation,
and
the
party
in
tashjian
made
one
decision.
the
parties
here
want
to
make
a
different
one
and,
under
the
first
amendment,
they
have
that
choice.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
although
your
criterion
may
not
be
an
ideological
criterion,
my
understanding,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
that
the
virtues
that
you
extol
are
inseparable
from
a
feature
that
seems
to
go
with
the
system,
and
that
is,
more
centrist
candidates,
so
that
it
seems
to
me
inseparable
from
what
you
claim
are
its
virtues,
that
there
is
a
change
in
content
of
the
political
message
of
the
people
who
are
being
selected.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--regardless
of
where
it
pulls
it,
it
pulls
it
in
the
direction
of,
in
effect,
an
imposed
content
modification.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there's
anything
in
the
statute
that
determines
what
the
content
will
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
is
inseparable
from
a
regime
in
which
the
popular
choice
of
voters
will
determine
the
content
of
the
message
attributed
to
a
given
political
party.
