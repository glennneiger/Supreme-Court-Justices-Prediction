justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show
whether
there's
significant
cross-over
voting,
or
voting
by
members
of
a
different
party,
for
the
minor
parties
like
libertarians?
i
would
assume
most
people
who
vote
for
a
libertarian
candidate
would
be
libertarians.
i
mean,
do
the
democrats
try
and
jimmy
up
the
libertarian
nominee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
indicate,
for
example,
the
particularly
well-known
libertarian...
i
mean,
michael
jordan
running
on
the
libertarian
ticket,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
stupid
question?
i'm
trying
to
find
out
the
source
of
the
constitution,
you
know,
both
sides,
and
article
i
section
4
says
that
the
times
and
places
and
manners
of
holding
elections
and
so
forth
shall
be
prescribed
in
each
state
by
the
legislature
thereof.
is
it
permissible
for
a
ballot
initiative
like
that
to
replace
the
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
people
who
wanted--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
not
the
legislature,
are
they,
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
the
framers
aware
of
initiative
and
referenda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
weren't
aware
of
political
parties,
either,
i
don't
suppose.
