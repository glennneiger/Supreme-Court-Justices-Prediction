justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
the
case,
then,
do
you...
you
agree,
i
take
it,
that
given
in
the
west
there
is
a
tradition
of
nonpartisan
elections,
so
i
guess
the
state
could
say,
we're
going
to
have
a
nonpartisan
gubernatorial
election.
anybody
can
run,
top
two
run-off.
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
so,
then,
picking
up
with
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
why
couldn't
they
say,
that's
the
system
we
want,
with
one
qualification.
we
want
the
run-off
to
be
between
whoever
calls
himself
a
republican
and
gets
the
most
votes,
versus
whoever
calls
himself
a
democrat
and
gets
the
most
votes.
that's
our
system.
now,
we're
not
trying
to
strengthen
the
parties
or
weaken
them.
they're
out
of
it.
that's
our
system
for
selecting
the
governor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
hypothesizing
what
could
be
california.
i
mean,
we're
going
to
have
the
top
person
who
calls
himself
a
republican
run
off
against
the
top
person
who
calls
himself
a
democrat.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
wouldn't
the
public
begin
to
understand
it
after
it
was
used
once?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you
all
said,
you
know,
this
isn't
really
a
republican.
it's
just
somebody
out
there
who
calls
himself
one,
or
a
democrat.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
that
interest
is
so
strong
that
it
warrants
throwing
out...
i
mean,
if
it's
valid
as
to
the
republicans
and
democrats,
is
it
invalid
as
a
whole
because
of
the
libertarians?
is
there
some
way
of
splitting
it?
i
didn't
see
how.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
response
to
what
i'm
now
thinking
of
as
the
lanham
act
problem?
that
is,
when
they
come
to
the
final
election
they're
labeled
republican,
and
democrat,
and
that
suggests
that
they're
the
candidates
that
the
parties
might
support,
and
they
aren't.
they're
just
someone
who
happens
to
call
himself
a
republican
who
gets
more
votes
than
anyone
else
who
calls
himself
a
republican,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
one
other
question,
a
slightly
different
topic.
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
what
i
think
of
as
the
libertarian
party
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
perhaps
it's
just
a
side
issue,
but
on
the
other
hand
it's
important
to
them,
so
what...
they're
saying
that
they,
as
i
take
it,
can
find
themselves
with
a
candidate
for
governor
who
may
just
reflect
random
factors,
nothing
to
do
with
the
libertarian
philosophy.
do
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
i
said
enough
to
point
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
what
i'm
worried
about?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that,
because
none
of
your
compelling
interests,
et
cetera,
deal
with
the
burden
that
it
imposes
upon
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
as
they
see
it,
rather
than,
say,
as
you
see
it...
as
they
see
it,
as
i
understand
it,
they
say,
here
we
have
a
party
that's
committed
to
an
ideal,
and
if
we
can
stay
committed
to
it,
we
will,
in
fact,
eventually
persuade
people.
but
we
cannot
stay
committed
to
that
ideal
when,
because
of
random
considerations,
basically,
we
find
ourselves
saddled
with
a
gubernatorial
candidate
who
may
not
even
share
that
ideal,
and
all
of
the
compelling
reasons
you've
given
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
us,
say
the
small
parties.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
case
would
be
different
if,
in
fact,
a
democratic
legislature
had
imposed
exactly
the
same
requirement
over
the
objection
of
the
republicans
but
not
the
democrats?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tashjian
doesn't
say
it
looks
to
factors
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
had
thought
perhaps
that
tashjian
was
a
case
where
the
justification
fell
in
the
legislature
saying,
we
will
tell
you
who
really
is
the
republican
party,
while
here
the
legislature
is
saying,
we're
not
so
interested,
frankly.
we
concede
that
this
is
weakening
the
parties,
and
we're
doing
it
for
other
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
haven't
accepted
that,
so
i'm
prepared
to
jettison
my--
