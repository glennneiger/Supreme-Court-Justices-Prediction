h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-401,
california
democratic
party
v.
bill
jones.
mr.
waters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
nonpartisan
general
election?
could
the
state
say,
you
know,
we're
just
going
to
have
a...
we
don't
want
any
party
identifications
for
the
candidates
for
the
general
election?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
case
should
be
brought
under
the
lanham
act,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gede,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
a
party
takes
the
position
that
we
think
legislative
gridlock
is
good,
because
there
are
too
many
laws
on
the
books
already?
isn't
that
party
going
to
be
at
least
partially
deterred
by
this
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
how...
what
did
they
say
the
burden
was,
albeit
they
said
it
was
minor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
suppose
the
voters,
or
the
legislature
says,
there
are
some
parties
that
are
so
far
out
we're
just
going
to
outlaw
them?
i
mean,
surely
they
couldn't
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
certainly
a
rather
severe
burden
to
be
outlawed,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
fatal
burden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gede.
mr.
waters,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-401,
california
democratic
party
versus
jones
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
