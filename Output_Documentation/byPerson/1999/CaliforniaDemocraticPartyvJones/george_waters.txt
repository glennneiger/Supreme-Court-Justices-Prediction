mr.
george
waters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
state
of
california
can
force
political
parties
to
choose
their
nominees
for
public
office
through
a
blanket
primary
system
which
is
expressly
designed
to
produce
more
moderate
nominees
than
those
that
are
favored
by
the
parties
themselves.
under
california
law,
the
only
means
by
which
a
party
can
nominate
his
candidates
for
the
ballot
is
through
the
blanket
primary
system.
the
blanket
primary
makes
the
issue
of
party
affiliation
and
ideology
irrelevant.
it
allows
any
voter
to
cross
party
lines
and
to
vote
in
several
different
party
primaries
at
the
very
same
election.
it
is
a
wholesale
assault
on
the
party...
political
parties'
first
amendment
right
to
choose
the
standard-bearer
who
best
represents
the
party's
ideology.
this
case
is
a
direct
descendent
of
this
court's
decision
in
tashjian,
which
held
that
connecticut
could
not
enforce
a
closed
primary
law
on
a
party
that
sought
to
open
its
primary
to
independent
voters.
mr.
george
waters
they
differ
significantly,
your
honor.
in
california...
to
begin
with
the
open
primary,
the
generic
open
primary
exists
in
a
state
where
there
is
no
party
registration.
voters
come
to
the
polling
place,
if
they're
registered
they
go
into
the
polling
place,
and
in
a
classic
open
primary
state
i
believe
that
they
are
given
the
ballots
of
any
political
party
and
they
make
a
choice
of
which
party
that
they
vote
in.
mr.
george
waters
but
they
vote
within
a
party,
your
honor.
mr.
george
waters
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
there
are
quantitative
and
qualitative
decision
differences
here
between
an
open
primary
and
a
blanket
primary,
and
if
i
could
go
into
that,
i
think
the
qualitative
difference
is
that
suggested
by
justice
powell
in
his
dissent
in
the
lafollette
case,
which
involved
another
issue,
but
in
which
justice
powell
discussed
at
some
length
the
issue
of
the
validity
or
the
constitutionality
of
open
and
closed
primaries.
and
justice
powell's
position
there
was
that
what
the
first
amendment
guarantees
to
the
parties
is
the
right
to
have...
to
limit
their
nominating
process
to
voters
who
affiliate
with
the
party.
he
said
the
question
presented
in
that
case,
which
dealt
with
wisconsin,
an
open
primary
state,
was
whether
there
was
an
act
of
affiliation.
what
justice
powell
said
is,
when
a
wisconsin
voter
chooses
the
ballot
of
a
democratic
or
republican
party,
that
in
itself
is
an
act
of
affiliation
because
that
voter
is
choosing
to
limit
him...
hisself
or
herself
to
the
nominees
of
one
party.
mr.
george
waters
well,
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
waters
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
american
regulation
of
political
parties
is
distinct,
and
what
we
have
is
a
history
where
the
government
in
virtually
every
state
has
operated
to
try
and
make
it
easy
for
people
to
affiliate
with
a
party,
but
in
states
that
have
party
systems,
and
california
has
a
party
system,
proposition
198
itself,
when
you
register
to
vote,
it's
in
proposition
198
you
actually
state
that
you
affiliate
with
a
political
party.
the
fact
that--
mr.
george
waters
--i
think
it
is
not.
i
think
it
is
not.
i
think
the
constitution
means
something,
and
i
think
that
the
constitution
means
that
a
party
has
a
right
to
limit
its
nominating
process
to
people
who
affiliate
with
it
in
some
sense.
mr.
george
waters
i
would
prefer
to
have
a
higher
hurdle.
mr.
george
waters
well,
no.
i
mean...
i
just
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
affiliating...
first
of
all,
i
think
one
has
to
assume
that
in
the
american
system
that
most
voters
operate
in
good
faith,
that
when
they
are
making...
when
they
choose
a
party
ballot,
that
they
are
choosing
that
for
a
reason,
that
the
republican
ballot
means
something
to
them,
a
democratic
or
a
libertarian
ballot
means
something
to
them.
mr.
george
waters
i
think
we
have
to
do
that.
mr.
george
waters
i
think
we
have
to
do
that
to
distinguish
a
blanket
primary
from
the
open
primary.
i
mean,
personally
i
would
much
prefer,
as
would
the
parties
before
you
in
this
case,
prefer
to
have
a
more
significant
gesture
of
affiliation,
and
california--
mr.
george
waters
--i
believe
the
constitutional
issue
which
we're
bringing
to
you
today
would
not
exist
there,
because
i
think
in
that
case
the
state
would
not
be
commandeering
the
parties
as
a
vehicle
for...
to
blend
the
political
ideologies
together.
california
indeed
has
a
nonpartisan
nominating
system
for
the
vast
majority
of
races,
those
that
are
not
for
congress,
senate,
the
assembly,
and
state-wide,
and
there
is,
indeed,
one
state-wide
office,
the
superintendent
of
public
construction,
that
is
elected
through
a
nonpartisan
primary.
mr.
george
waters
not
that
i
know
of.
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
although
i
will
say
that
the
evidence
at
trial
did
not
explore
that
perhaps
in
great
depth.
i
mean,
as
petitioners...
as
plaintiffs
we
did
not
go
into
great
depth
in
other
states.
one
thing
about
louisiana,
because
your
honor
just
brought
it
up,
which
i
think
is
distinctive,
i
think
louisiana
is
a
blend.
it
presents
yet
another
issue
here,
in
that
it
is
a
nonpartisan
primary
there
in
the
sense
that
only
two...
the
two
highest
vote-getters
go
on
to
the
general
election.
however,
party
labels
are
used
on
the
ballot
there.
the
candidates
have
their
names
followed
by
democrat,
republican,
or
whatever.
i
think
that
louisiana
might
present
a
different
issue,
and
that
is
the
use
of
a
party
label
in
their
race,
but
not
the
issue
that
is
presented
here.
mr.
george
waters
i
don't
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
george
waters
it
is
indeed,
sir.
mr.
george
waters
i
think
the
result
may
or
may
not
be
similar
to
that.
i
think
that
in
the
situation
you're
describing
the
difference...
if
california
were
to
go
toward
a
nonpartisan
primary
system
there
would
be
at
first
a
significant
difference.
first
of
all
it's
very...
it's
not...
there
would
have
to
be
some
relatively
easy
means
for
people
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot,
which
is
indeed
the
case
now
for
california
nonpartisan...
or...
yes,
for
california
nonpartisan
races.
i
mean,
there'd
have
to
be
some
loosening
up.
i
mean,
it's
very
hard
for
an
independent
candidate
in
california
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot.
the
whole
system
is
designed
to
force
people
into
the
party
system.
if
they
went
nonpartisan,
i
assume
that
it
would
be...
a
result
of
that
would
also,
there
would
have
to
be
relatively
easy
access
to
getting
on
the
primary
ballot,
and
at
that
point
i
think
each
party
would
have
the
access...
i
think
there
might
be
access
questions,
but
they'd
have
to
have
a
way
to
get
on
there
somehow.
candidates
have
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot.
what
happens
after
that
might
present
a
whole
range
of
issues,
but
the
point
is
that
those
people,
california
would
not
in
a
sense
be
renting
the
parties,
to
use
their
names
to
promote
false
candidates.
i
mean,
that
is
not--
mr.
george
waters
--yes,
and
on
the
first
one
it's
not
just
that
there's
been
no
act
of
affiliation,
that
indeed,
under
proposition
198
itself,
when
people
register
to
vote
they
are
invited
to
make
an
affiliation
with
another
party.
it's
just
not
no
act
of
affiliation,
but
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
suggested,
where
mervyn
field,
the
leading
pollster
in
california
testified
before
trial
that
his
polls
at
that
point
suggested
30
percent
of
registered
republicans
would
cross
over.
it's
just
that...
it's
not
just
the
lack
of
affiliation.
these
are
actually
voters
who
have
signed
the
registration
in
another
party.
mr.
george
waters
well,
that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
tashjian
a
much
more
difficult
case
from
my
side
of
the
aisle
than
this
case.
i
mean,
tashjian
was
a
right-of-association
case,
that
it
was
indeed
a
case
where
the
republican
party
wanted
to
open
up
and
invite
independents
to
join
in.
mr.
george
waters
that's
correct.
tashjian--
mr.
george
waters
--tashjian...
tashjian
is
a
slightly...
i
think
there's
two
theories
here.
tashjian,
if
i
could
just
speak
colloquially,
i
think
represents
to
people
who
practice
in
this
field
as
a
party
sovereignty
case.
it
essentially...
what
it's
distilled
down
to
is
that
tashjian
stands
for
the
proposition
that
parties
have
at
least
some
rights
to
structure
their
own
rules.
mr.
george
waters
i
do,
indeed.
i
do,
indeed,
but
what
i'm
saying...
i
agree.
yes,
i
do
agree
with
tashjian,
and
i
think
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
weighing
test,
that...
and...
under
timmons,
as
this
court
said,
but
under
a
weighing
test
the
political
association
rights
of
parties
have
to
be
tested
by
what
the
real
consequences
are.
mr.
george
waters
i
think
one
could
very
easily
say
that
that's
unconstitutional,
your
honor--
mr.
george
waters
--and
then
this
court
would
have
to,
or
a
court
would
have
to
go
through
the
weighing
process,
but
i
mean,
my
point
with
tashjian
is,
i
think
that
the...
one...
the
first
element
i
think
that
under
this
court's
test
that
you
have
to
measure
is,
is
there
a
severe
burden
on
the
party's
associational
rights?
whatever
one
can
say
about
tashjian,
i
think
here,
where
every
california
voter,
15
million
of
them
are
invited
to
vote
in
every
party's
primary
in
each
race
with
absolutely
no
right
of
affiliation,
that
is
a
very
significant
and,
in
fact,
severe
infringement
on
party
rights.
mr.
george
waters
we're...
the
answer's
no,
we're
not
seeking
any
kind
of
retroactive
relief
here,
and
we
haven't
asked
for
any
in
the
complaint.
this
was
filed
almost
within
5
months
after
the
election
where
this...
where
proposition
198
was
adopted.
there
have
been
a
number
of
races
under
this,
and
it
is
now
clear
that
in
a
handful
of
them,
and
actually
we
don't
know
how
many,
that
the
blanket
primary
has
changed
the
results
of
elections,
but--
mr.
george
waters
--this
case
itself
will
have
no
direct
effect
on
those
cases.
mr.
george
waters
i
think
the
argument
we
made
is
just...
one
of
the
arguments
we
made
was
the
dilution
of
the
ballot
label,
which
might
slough
over
to
that,
but
i
have
to
admit,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
it
did
not
dawn
on
me
when
i
did
the
trial
that
there
would
be
23
names
on
the
presidential
primary
ballot.
there
were
23
contestants--
mr.
george
waters
--it's
randomized.
under
california
statute
it's
not
by
party,
not
by
alphabetical
order.
there's
a
randomization--
mr.
george
waters
--any
conceivable
pattern
is
possible,
because
it's
totally
random
under
statute.
mr.
george
waters
well,
i
would
focus
on
the
dilution
more
than
the
confusion,
but
i
think
that
obviously
one
deliberate
aspect
of
proposition
198
was
to
invite
people
to
cross
over
in
each
race
and
vote
in
other
parties'
primaries.
the
record
here
is--
mr.
george
waters
--the
ones
who
are
on
the--
mr.
george
waters
--2000
ballot
for
a
partisan
office?
mr.
george
waters
they
are...
they're
self-selected.
the
parties
have
no
ability
in
california
to
vet
the
candidates
who
choose
to
run
their
primaries.
what
happens
is,
let's
take
a
republican
example.
if...
let's
just
assume
that
i'm
registered
republican.
i
want
to
run
for
congress
as
a
republican.
i
have
to
be
a
registered
republican,
and
i
have
to
not
have
been
registered
in
any
other
party
12
months...
well,
actually,
24
months
before
the
general
election.
then
i
take
out
nomination
papers,
and
the
number
that
comes
to
mind
is...
i
pay
a
fee,
and
i
have
get,
i
believe
40
to
60
signatures.
i
could
be
wrong
about
that,
and
then
i
will
appear--
mr.
george
waters
--they
would
be--
mr.
george
waters
--i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
that
they
have
to
be
members
of
the
party
whose
nomination
you
are
seeking.
mr.
george
waters
i
do
not
see
any
constitutional
limitation--
mr.
george
waters
--i
think
the
use
of
the
party
label
in
that
situation
creates
constitutional
issues.
i
think
that--
mr.
george
waters
--because...
i
think
the
question
there...
and
i
guess
you're
hypothesizing
a
louisiana
situation,
as--
mr.
george
waters
--i
think
if
the
system
is
structured
so
that
the
public
perceives
them
as
nominees
of
the
parties
whose
labels
they
are
using,
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
there.
mr.
george
waters
i
think--
mr.
george
waters
--i
think...
i
think
that's
an
empirical
question
and
i
can't
answer
it
right
now,
but
i
really
think...
i
guess
my
general
answer
to
that
line
of
questioning
is
that
i
have
no
doubt
that
california,
although
none
of
the
parties
before
you
prefer
it,
i
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
problem
with
california
or
any
state
adopting
nonpartisan
primary
elections.
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
it.
but
having
said
that,
once
the
party
names
come
into
the
mix
it
changes
things,
and
i
think
in
california
it
is
clearly
true
that
the
public
didn't
want
to
adopt
a
nonpartisan
system.
it
wasn't
presented
to
them,
and
i
think
as
a
reality,
and
this
is
an
empirical
question,
the
people
actually
take
very
seriously
voting
for
a
democrat
or
a
republican,
or
somebody
else.
mr.
george
waters
i
believe
a
state
could
constitutionally
do
that,
your
honor,
and
i
believe...
i'm
not
sure...
i
mean,
there's
50
states,
and
one
thing
i've
learned
through
this,
that
there
are
essentially
50
different
variations
of
systems.
but
i
believe
that
nebraska...
i'm
not
sure
that
nebraska
uses
labels
on
the
general
election
ballot
for
its
legislative
offices,
but
in
any
event
i
believe
that
that
would
be
constitutional,
your
honor,
and
it
would
be
constitutional
from
our
way
of
looking
at
it
because
the
parties
would
not
be
in
a
position
of
having
their
name
used
by
people
who
are
in
fact
not
supported
by
the
members
of
the
individual
parties.
in
that
system,
i'm
sure
that
the
parties
would
get
their
favorite
candidates
on
somehow,
and
they
would
run
outside
of
the
system.
mr.
george
waters
well,
two
answers
to
that.
first,
the
most
significant
endorsement
is
the
nomination
itself.
i
mean,
the
parties
are
coerced
here
to
put
the
nomination
on
candidates
who
will
appear
on
the
ballot
as
libertarian.
it
is
indeed
true
that,
due
to
a
constitutional
decision
coming
out
of
this
court,
that
parties
can
endorse
whomever
they
like,
but
it
would
put
the
libertarian
in
the
party
in
the
situation
of
having
their
own
candidate,
a
libertarian-anointed
candidate
on
the
ballot
held
out
to
the
public
as
their
representative,
and
then
trying
to
get
somebody
else
on.
now,
trying
to
get
somebody
else
on,
let
me
just
say
that
the
parties
cannot
get
nominees
on
the
ballot
any
other
way.
i
mean,
there
is
no--
mr.
george
waters
--the
party...
in
the--
mr.
george
waters
--during
the
primary
elections,
certainly,
the
party
could
say
that,
yes.
mr.
george
waters
because
the
problem
with
that
is
the
universe
of
voters
who
are
going
to
choose
that
nominee
are
not
the
libertarian
electorate.
it's
the
entire...
it
is
15
million
voters
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
george
waters
that
is
indeed
true.
i
do
not
deny
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
conforms
with
the
constitution,
which
this
court
has
said
allows
parties
to
choose
standard-bearers
of
their
own
choice.
i
mean,
despite...
even
though
the
endorsement
process
could
go
on
there,
the
candidate,
the
winner
of
that
race
would
not
be
chosen
by
members
of
the
libertarian
party,
and
the
libertarian
party
i
think
is
a
very
good
example
to
discuss
here,
because
they
are
a
very
small
party.
they...
i
mean,
they
do
not
have
the
wherewithal...
i
mean,
if
there's
some
kind
of
empirical
justification
required
here,
the
libertarian
party
does
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
go
out
to
15
million
voters
in
california
and
buy
air
time
and
say,
joe's
a
good
libertarian
and
ed
isn't.
mr.
george
waters
no,
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
a
way
to
split
it,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is...
i
think
the
libertarians
are
a
particularly
dramatic
example
of
what
can
happen,
but
i
think
each
party
in
california
is
in
the
same
position
with
proposition
198.
mr.
george
waters
before
this
case,
i
would
have
made
the
same
assumption,
justice
stevens,
and
what
the
record
shows
is
that
there
was
an
expert
report
provided
by
richard
winger
who,
on
the
basis
of
historical
voting
patterns
in
california,
he...
at
trial
he
testified
that
he
believed
in
minor
party
primaries
that
the
number
of
voters
from
outside
the
party
would
out-number
the
number
of
voters
from
inside
the
party.
now,
there
are
two
lodgings
before
this
court
which
are
not
in
the
record,
let
me
make
that
clear,
but
there
are
results
from
the
1998-2000
election,
and
in
the
1998
election,
an
incident,
three
incidents
which
are
in
our
opening
brief,
there
are
three
incidents
where...
and
in
libertarian
primaries
i
think
their
assembly
races,
the
number
of
voters
voting
in
those
races
was
actually
about
two-and-a-half
times
the
number
of
registered
libertarians
in
those
districts.
now,
i
don't
know
how
many
of
the
libertarians
actually
voted,
but
my
point
is
that
the
ratio
is
actually
two-and-a-half
to
one,
at
the
very
least
two
and
a
half...
the
two-and-a-half
being
people
who
are
not
registered
libertarians
nominating
those
libertarian
voters.
so
i
mean,
one
question
your
honor
might
ask
is,
why
does
that
happen?
i
mean,
we
could
all
speculate
about
it,
but
there's--
mr.
george
waters
--i
think...
none
of
them
were
particularly
well-known,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter...
what
the
libertarians
testified
about
at
trial
is,
if
they
have
the
only
female
nominee
in
a
race
where
there
are
eight
males,
some
percentage
of
the
electorate
will
vote
for
the
female.
if
they
have
the
only
hispanic
nominee
with
an
hispanic
name
in
a
race
where
they're
the
only
hispanic,
then
there
will
be
this
flooding
effect,
so--
mr.
george
waters
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
george
waters
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
california
law
dating
back
from
19...
well,
before
1908,
the
whole
goal
of
california
law
was
to
bring
the
parties
within
the
system
to
democratize
them.
the
only
way
that
a
party
could
go
off
the
ballot,
it
would
be
to...
take
the
democratic
party.
the
only
way
it
would
get
off
the
ballot
is
if
no
state-wide
candidate
got
more
than
2
percent
of
the
vote
at
the
previous
election,
and
their
registration
fell
below
1
percent
of
the
total
registration
in
the
state,
but
there's
absolutely
no
way
that
a
political
party
itself,
volitionally,
can
check
out
of
the
primary
process.
mr.
george
waters
the
whole
process
is
there
to
bring
them
in.
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
structure.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
george
waters
--i
believe,
reading
this
court's
opinions,
that
yes,
indeed,
you
have.
mr.
george
waters
we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
in
the...
california,
the
united
states
is
distinctive,
and
that
there
are
many
significant
intrusions
on
party
associational
rights.
we
think
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
there
is
any
limit
to
what
the
state
can
do
vis-a-vis
associational
rights.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left.
mr.
george
waters
thank
you.
mr.
george
waters
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
my
previous
argument.
i'd
be
delighted
to
answer
any
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
george
waters
thank
you,
your
honor.
