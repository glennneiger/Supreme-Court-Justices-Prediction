suppose
california
had
a
nonpartisan
blanket
primary.
suppose
it
said,
we're
not
going
to
try
to
choose
a
party's
candidate.
there
isn't...
there's
not
going
to
be
that
kind
of
primary.
it's
going
to
be
a
nonpartisan
primary.
would
you
have
any
constitutional
objection
that
you
could
make
if
proposition
198
had
been
for
a
nonpartisan
primary
instead
of
a
partisan
primary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
any
state
other
than,
we're
told,
louisiana,
have
such
a
nonpartisan
system
for
state-wide
offices?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waters,
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
tashjian
case,
but
i
thought
that
the
republican
position
there
was,
we
are
not
claiming
that
these
independents
that
we
want
to
open
our
primary
to
are
affiliating
with
our
party.
we
just
want
to
appeal
to
them
and
extend
our
audience
to
people
that
we
know
consider
themselves
independent.
i
thought
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made,
not
that
they
were
in
effect
making
an
affiliation
with
the
republican
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
something
that
i
don't
understand
as
a
matter
of
fact?
say
i'm
looking
under
u.s.
representative
on
the
2000
ballot
and
it
lists
two
republicans,
how
are
those
candidates
selected,
the
ones
that
do
appear?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
must
those
signatures
be
all
republicans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
when
you
petition
to
get
on
the
ballot
as
a
republican,
do
the
people
that
have
to
support
you,
could
they
be
democrats?
could
they
be
independents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waters--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
the
party
have
the
choice
of
opting
out
of
this
whole
system,
picking
its
candidate
whatever
way
it
likes,
and
then
petitioning
to
put
that
candidate
on
the
ballot
for
the
general
election?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
has
to
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
there
any
indication
that
the
nominees
that
have
emerged
from
this
blanket
primary
are
different
from
the
nominees
that
would
emerge
if
you
had
a
closed
party
primary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
people
who
appear
on
this
ballot--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let's
say,
republican,
democrat,
is
there
any
indication
that
they
would
have
been...
that
the
winners
would
have
been
different
if
california
still
had
the
closed
primary?
