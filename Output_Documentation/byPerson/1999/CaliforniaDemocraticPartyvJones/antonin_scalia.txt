justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could,
have
an
open
nonpartisan
primary
and
decide
that
only
the
first
five
people
on
that
nine...
nonpartisan
primary
will
automatically
go
on
the
general
election
ballot,
but
that's
not
what
you've
done.
you
haven't
let
the
people
select
who
are
going
to
be
the
candidates
among
whom
they
will
choose.
you've
let
the
people
select
who
the
republican
party
nominee
is
going
to
be
and
who
the
democratic
party
nominee
is
going
to
be,
rather
than
letting
republicans
select
it
and
democrats
select
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
select
their
candidates.
you're
allowing
them
to
select
the
republican
party's
candidates,
whether
they're
republicans
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
achieve
what
you're
after
if
you're
saying
what
we
want
to
do
is
let
the
people
select
who
the
candidates
for
office
should
be.
you
could
achieve
that,
not
by
forcing
the
republicans
to
accept
the
candidate
that
the
republicans
don't
want.
you
could
achieve
it
by
simply
having
a
nonpartisan
primary.
let
the
voters
select
who
the
five
most
popular
people
are
and
they'll
get
on
the
ballot.
wouldn't
that
achieve
the
same
thing
as
you're
doing
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
be
a
republican
that
day
anyway,
and
you
cannot
vote
for
non-republican
candidates.
by
making
that
commitment,
at
least
you're
excluding
yourself
from
voting
for
candidates
for
other
parties,
right,
which
is
not
the
case
in
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
determine
the
republican
party
nominee
for
one
office
and
the
democratic
party
nominee
for
another
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
absolutely
no
commitment
to
a
particular
party,
not
even
for
the
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
there
is
in
the
other
primaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
not?
i
mean,
what
about
the
party
that
does
not
want
to
be
representative?
it
thinks
the
country's
going
in
the
wrong
direction.
it
knows
the
majority
wants
to
go
that
way,
but
it
wants
to
send
out
a
message,
a
clarion
call
to
call
the
country
back
to
the
right
road,
and
it
wants
to
select
a
candidate
who
will
do
that,
and
your
system
says,
ah
no,
we'll
have
massive
participation,
so
the
majority
will
come
in
and
say,
ah,
we
like
the
road
we're
going
on.
is
that
what
the
democratic
system
is
supposed
to
produce?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
mind
majoritarian
rule
at
the
point
of
election,
but
at
the
point
of
campaigning,
and
of
trying
to
persuade
the
people,
you're
saying
you
cannot
even
have
a
party
candidate
who
wants
to
go
in
the
wrong
direction.
the
majority
will
decide
what's
the
right
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
won't
even
debate
about
going
in
the
other
direction,
because
we'll
be
sure
to
select
candidates
who
agree
with
the
majority.
justice
antonin
scalia
acne,
oh,
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
gridlock?
i
mean,
god,
the
traffic
problems
in
l.a.
are
attributable
to
this
thing,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
be
representative,
says
this
party.
i
do
not
want
to
be
representative.
they're
all
going
in
the
wrong
direction.
what
is
that
party
supposed
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
is
saying,
you
will
be
representative,
but
i
don't
want
to
be
representative.
i
want
to
get
off
in
a
new
direction.
you
can't
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
democratic.
it's
wonderfully
democratic,
but
usually
we
let
parties
put
up
candidates,
and
we
exercise
the
democratic
rights
in
the
election,
but
you're
saying
parties
can't
even
put
up
candidates.
we're
going
to
extend
democracy
one
step
earlier
and
not
even
let
any
parties
put
up
people
whom
the
majority
doesn't
like.
that
doesn't...
you
know,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--democracy
carried
to
an
extreme,
to
the
tyranny
of
the
majority.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
we
should
just
drive
out
all
those
parties
that
don't
stand
much
of
a
chance.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
you
even
let
the
2-percent
parties
in.
they're
just
there
to
try
to
disseminate
their
ideas.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gede--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
with
tashjian?
bear
in
mind,
i
dissented
in
tashjian
because
i
thought
the
state
could
tell
a
party,
without
affecting
its
associational
interests,
you
have
to
have
a
closed
primary,
but
if
that
is
unconstitutional,
as
we
said,
because
that
somehow
interferes
too
much
with
a
party's
associational
rights,
how
could
it
possibly
not
interfere
even
more
with
a
party's
associational
rights
to
say,
you
cannot
have
a
closed
primary?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
so
persuaded
by
my
dissent
you
say
that's
the
only
conceivable
explanation
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
one
party
in
power.
i
don't
know
any
legislature
that
isn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
majority
of
one
party
or
majority
of
the
other
party,
so
if
it
gets
to
a
legislature
it's
always
going
to
have
to
be
imposed
by
one
party,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
tashjian
was
nondiscriminatory.
it
was
imposed
on
all
sides,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
you
say
it
was
imposed
by
one
party,
namely
the
party
that
controlled
the
legislature,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
the
party
that
wants
to
expand,
as
you
think
these
parties
do,
couldn't
it
conduct
a
public
opinion
poll?
is
there
any
reason
why
the
majority
of
citizens
has
to
use
the
primary
for
that
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
one
way
that
candidate’s
republic
office
in
california
gain
access
to
the
general
ballot
is
by
winning
the
primary
of
a
qualified
political
party.
in
1996
proposition
198
changed
the
state’s
partisan
primary
system
from
a
closed
primary
in
which
only
a
political
party’s
members
can
vote
on
its
nominees
to
what
is
called
a
blanket
primary
in
which
each
voter’s
ballot
lists
every
candidate
regardless
of
party
affiliation
and
allows
the
voter
to
choose
freely
among
them.
the
candidate
of
each
party
who
wins
the
most
votes
is
that
party’s
nominee
for
the
general
election.
a
blanket
primary,
it
should
be
noted
is
different
from
an
open
primary
in
which
although
the
voter
need
not
be
a
member
of
the
party
in
order
to
participate,
he
is
permitted
to
vote
for
the
candidates
of
only
one
party
and
cannot
as
in
the
blanket
primary
vote
for
the
candidate
of
one
party
for
one
office
and
of
other
parties
for
other
offices.
our
holding
today
deals
only
with
the
blanket
primary.
petitioners
are
the
california
democratic
party,
the
california
republican
party,
the
libertarian
party
of
california
and
the
peace
and
freedom
party,
each
of
which
prohibits
nonmembers
from
voting
in
their
primaries.
they
filed
suit
against
respondants
alleging
inter
alia
that
the
blanket
primary
violated
their
first
amendment
rights
of
political
association.
the
district
court
held
that
the
primary's
burden
on
the
petitioner’s
association
rights
was
not
severe
and
was
justified
by
substantial
state
interest,
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse.
it
is
true
of
course
that
states
play
a
major
role
in
structuring
and
monitoring
the
primary
election
process,
but
the
procedures
by
which
political
parties
select
their
nominees
are
not
wholly
public
affairs
that
states
may
regulate
freely.
to
the
contrary
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
states
must
act
within
limits
imposed
by
the
constitution
when
regulating
parties’
internal
processes.
the
first
amendment
protects
the
freedom
to
join
together
to
further
common
political
beliefs,
which
presupposes
the
freedom
to
identify
those
who
constitute
the
association
and
to
limit
the
association
to
those
people.
in
no
area
is
the
political
association’s
right
to
exclude
more
important
than
in
its
candidate-selection
process.
that
process
often
determines
the
party’s
position
on
significant
public
policy
issues
and
it
is
the
nominee
who
is
the
party’s
ambassador
charged
with
wining
the
general
electorate
over
to
the
party’s
views.
california’s
blanket
primary
violates
these
principles.
proposition
198
forces
petitioners
to
adulterate
their
candidate-selection
processes
by
opening
them
up
to
person
wholly
unaffiliated
with
the
party,
who
may
have
wholly
different
views
from
those
of
the
party
faithful.
the
evidence
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
under
california’s
blanket
primary
system
the
prospect
of
having
a
party’s
nominee
determined
by
adherence
of
an
opposing
party
is
far
from
remote.
indeed
it
is
a
clear
and
present
danger.
in
1997
survey
of
california
voters,
37%
of
republicans
said
that
they
plan
vote
in
the
1998
democratic
gubernatorial
primary
and
20%
of
democrats
said
that
they
plan
to
vote
in
the
1998
republican
united
states
senate
primary
and
the
impact
upon
minor
parties
such
as
the
libertarian
party
and
the
peace
and
freedom
party
is
even
greater.
in
the
first
primary
these
parties
conducted
following
california’s
implementation
of
proposition
198.
the
total
votes
cast
for
party
candidates
in
some
races
was
more
than
double
the
total
number
of
registered
party
members.
the
effect
of
this
system
upon
the
party
is
not
merely
the
occasional
alternation
of
the
identity
of
its
nominee.
even
when
the
person
favored
by
a
majority
of
that
party
members
prevails,
he
will
have
prevailed
by
taking
somewhat
different
positions
in
order
to
appeal
to
non-party
members
and
should
he
be
elected,
will
continue
to
take
somewhat
different
positions
in
order
to
be
re-nominated.
in
short
proposition
198
has
the
likely
outcome
indeed
as
respondents
themselves
admit
the
intended
outcome
of
changing
the
party’s
message.
because
there
is
no
heavier
burden
on
a
political
party’s
associational
freedom,
proposition
198
is
unconstitutional
unless
it
is
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
none
of
the
respondents’
seven
proffered
state
interest
is
compelling.
the
first
two
producing
elected
officials
who
better
represent
the
electorate
and
expanding
candidate
debate
beyond
the
scope
of
partisan
concerns
are
simply
circumlocution
for
producing
nominees
and
nominee
positions
more
favored
by
the
majority
than
those
the
parties
would
choose
if
left
to
their
own
devices.
that
is
nothing
more
than
stark
repudiation
of
freedom
of
political
association.
the
third
asserted
interest
is
assuring
that
so-called
disenfranchised
persons
by
which
is
meant
independents
and
members
of
the
minority
party
in
“safe”
districts.
enjoy
the
right
to
an
effective
vote.
this
is
simply
re-characterizing
non-party
member’s
keen
desire
to
participate
in
selection
of
the
party’s
nominee
as
disenfranchisement
if
the
desire
is
not
fulfilled.
we
have
said
in
an
earlier
case
however
that
“a
nonmembers
desire
to
participate
in
the
party’s
affairs
is
overborne
by
the
counter
veiling
and
legitimate
right
of
the
party
to
determine
its
own
membership
qualifications.”
although
respondents
remaining
asserted
interests
namely
promoting
fairness
affording
voters
greater
choice,
increasing
voter
participation
and
protecting
privacy
maybe
compelling
in
some
circumstances
we
hold
that
they
are
not
in
this
case.
that
determination
is
not
be
made
in
the
abstract
by
asking
whether
fairness,
privacy
etcetera
are
highly
significant
values,
but
rather
by
asking
whether
the
aspect
of
fairness,
privacy
etcetera
addressed
by
the
law
at
issue
is
highly
significant
and
for
all
four
of
these
asserted
interest
we
find
it
not
to
be.
finally,
we
observed
that
proposition
198
is
not
being
narrowly
tailored
means
of
furthering
all
of
respondents
asserted
interests.
respondents
could
protect
each
by
resorting
to
a
nonpartisan
blanket
primary.
generally
speaking,
under
such
a
system
the
state
determines
what
qualifications
it
requires
for
a
candidate
to
have
place
on
the
primary
ballot,
which
may
include
nomination
by
a
established
parties
and
voter-petition
requirements
for
independent
candidates
and
then
voters
regardless
of
party
affiliation
may
choose
among
these
candidates,
the
top
two
vote
getters
or
however
many
of
the
state
prescribes
then
moving
on
to
the
general
election.
this
system
has
all
the
characteristics
of
partisan
blanket
primary,
save
the
constitutionally
crucial
one,
primary
voters
are
not
choosing
a
party’s
nominee.
