now,
open
primaries
differ
from
the
blanket
primary
system
imposed
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
we
agreed
with
you
here
on
the
blanket
primary
thing,
wouldn't
we
be
casting
some
doubt
on
the
open
primary
system
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
waters,
are
you...
suppose
the
court
were
to
agree
with
your
position,
are
you
seeking
any
kind
of
retroactive
relief
here?
presumably
the
recent
elections
were
conducted
under
this
scheme
that
you're
challenging.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
guess
we
upheld
the
right
of
a
state
to
direct
that
primary...
parties
have
to
have
a
primary
election
rather
than
a
caucus
to
select
candidates.
i
mean,
that's
a
concept
we've
accepted,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
that's
a
tremendously
intrusive
burden
on
a
political
party's
rights
as
well,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
decide
the
message
of
the
particular
party.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
just
wonder
whether
that's
valid.
i
mean,
the
very
essence
of
the
party's
first
amendment
right
is
to
define
its
own
message
and
send
out
its
own
candidate.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
more
representative
if
it
doesn't
want
to
be,
does
it?
i
mean,
this
is
a
remarkable
proposition
you're
putting
forward.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
the
precise
time
when
the
party
ought
to
be
able
to
make
its
own
selection
for
the
spokesperson
to
run
in
the
general
election,
to
articulate
the
stand
and
the
views
that
the
party
wants
the
voters
to
have
a
chance
to
hear.
that's
precisely
the
point
at
which
the
associational
interest
of
the
party
is
at
its
zenith,
and
for
the
state
to
come
in
and
say
no,
you
have
to
be
more
representative
here,
is
simply
to
change
the
message,
and
i
think
if
the...
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
party
has
any
associational
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
left,
if
this
can
stand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
tell
me
what
would
remain
after
your
so-called
balancing
test
of
a
party's
right
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
you
say
the
answer
is
to
let
the
party
tell
the
voters
before
the
primary
election
which
candidate
they
support?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
normally
parties
use
primary
elections
to
let
the
registered
voters
in
that
party
tell
the
party
what
candidate
the
party
members
select.
