because
it
would
be
safe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only
if
there's
an
intent.
isn't
the
key...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
the
key
question
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
concede
there
is
an
intent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
lose
if
you
did
concede
there's
an
intent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
did
concede
there
was
an
intent,
would
you
not
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
there
had
been
a
partial
repeal
of
the
fda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
still
want
to
know.
do
you
think
that
those
statutes
amended
the
food,
drug...
the
food
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
basic
position
is
that
even
if
none
of
those
statutes
had
been
passed,
you
would
still
not
be
subject
to
the
statute
because
you
did
not
have
the
requisite
intent
because
you
didn't
advertise
the
cigarettes
as
being
addictive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
really
your
basic
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
basic
argument,
you
don't
need
all
these...
these
later
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
they're...
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me,
they're
totally
irrelevant...
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
don't
directly
answer
the
question...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
may
be
right
on
the
basic
question
because
they
didn't
advertise
this
product
the
way
they...
the
way
they
claim
you
intended
it
to
be
used,
but
i
thought
the
heart
of
your
argument
was
that
there's
no
intent
because
there's
no
claim
that
had
these...
these
positions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
problem
with
that...
let
me
just
get
it
right
on
the
table.
the
problem
with
that
is
it
seems
to
me
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
until
1990,
say,
you
had
no
intent
to
make
this
stuff
addictive
and
there
was
no
evidence,
objective
evidence
of
such
an
intent,
but
in
1994
or
'95,
such
evidence...
you
changed
your
minds,
and
you
then
decided
on
a
new
marketing
strategy
with
this
intent,
and
then...
and
then
for
the
first
time
became
under
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me,
that's
at
least
theoretically
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
just
to
the
addiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
only
focussing
on
intent,
the
intent
of
the
companies
marketing
the
product.
is
it
not
possible
that
the
intent
was
different
in
1985
than
it
is
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
rely
entirely
on
claims
in
the
marketplace,
it's
an
easy
case.
you
win.
you
don't
need
all
these
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
change
it.
supposing
the
evidence
of
objective
intent
didn't
surface
until
1995.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
saying
then
if
we
legalize
marijuana
on
the
theory
it
has
some
health
benefits
for
people
with
certain
disease
and
so
forth,
you
say
the
fda
could
not
regulate
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
intent
of
the
manufacturers
of
cigarettes
is
to
provide
certain
health
benefits,
why
is
that
different...
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
the
intent,
which,
of
course,
you
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
not
the
suppressant,
the
suppressant
of...
appetite
suppressant
and
the
three
or
four
things
they
mentioned,
relaxant
and
stimulant
and
so
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
they
made
that
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
then
regulate
if...
if
they
had
the
same
evidence
on
intent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
they
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
they
have
such
objective
evidence,
and
i
didn't
understand
you
to
disagree
with
that
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
statutory
text.
it's
regulatory
text.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
your
view,
the
fda
could
not
regulate
the
use
of
baby
aspirin
for
adults.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
way
they
now
advertise
it,
they
could
not
regulate
it;
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there
are
no
claims
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
provided,
though,
it
has
to
be
intended
for...
for
use
on
the
human
body.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
