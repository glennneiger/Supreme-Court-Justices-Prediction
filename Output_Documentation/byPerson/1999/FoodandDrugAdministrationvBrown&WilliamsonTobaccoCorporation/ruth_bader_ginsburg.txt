justice

for...
general
waxman,
what...
i
was
trying
to
see
if
there
was
an
analogy
to
something
else
that
the
fda
regulates,
that
is,
something
that
is
purchased
for
its
pleasurable
effects
that
has
these
dreadful,
harmful
effects,
and
is...
is
there
anything
that
isn't
being
put
forward
as
a
cure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
guess...
justice

but,
mr.
cooper,
suppose...
suppose
that
heroin,
it
wasn't
unlawful.
suppose,
as
in
the
case
of
cigarettes,
it's
lawful.
are
you
saying
if...
if
heroin
were
legalized
that
the
fda
then
could
not
regulate
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
by
the
fda.

so,
if
a
product
is
simply
harmful
to
one's
health,
then
it
falls
outside
of
the
fda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
that's
ingested
in
the
body.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
where
the...
where
the
core
use
of
it
is
ingesting
it
into
the
body...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
an
accident.
