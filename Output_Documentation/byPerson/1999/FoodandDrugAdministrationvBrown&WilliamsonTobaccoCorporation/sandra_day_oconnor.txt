although
they're
not
marketed,
are
they,
as
products
to
treat
or
prevent
disease
or
cure
disease
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
the
statute
goes
further
and
contemplates
that
devices,
if
approved
by
the
fda,
have
to
be
safe
and
effective,
and
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
use
of
tobacco
is
safe
and
effective?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
take
it
not.
so,
you
know,
it
just
doesn't
fit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it...
it
just...
it...
it
strains
credibility
to
say
that
these
products
can
be
safe
in
light
of
the
findings.
i
just
don't
understand
how
anybody
could
stand
here
and
say
fine,
they're
safe,
so
we'll
permit
them
to
be
used.
i
think
the
conclusion
under
the
statute
is
if
they
are
covered,
they
have
to
be...
it
has
to
be
banned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think...
do
you
think
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
that
under
this
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
we
certainly
operated
for
a
long
time
with
the
understanding
that
it
wasn't
covered...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
is
a
very
recent
phenomenon,
and
it
just...
it
doesn't
fit
very
well
under
the
structure
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
an
effect
on
the
body.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
waxman,
can
the
agency
regulate
the
movie
industry
that
produces
horror
movies
because
so
many
people
go
to
it
to
get
scared
and
get
the
adrenalin
pumping?
suppose
the
studies
show
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
30
years
ago...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
august
1996,
the
food
and
drug
administration
published
a
final
rule
imposing
regulations
on
the
sale
and
marketing
of
tobacco
products.
the
fda
found
that
nicotine
is
a
drug
and
that
cigarettes
and
smokeless
tobacco
are
devices
that
deliver
nicotine
to
the
body.
it
concluded
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
regulate
tobacco
products
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
a
group
of
tobacco
manufacturers,
retailers
and
advertisers
filed
suit
claiming
among
other
things
that
the
fda
lack
the
authority
to
regulate
tobacco.
the
federal
district
court
rejected
this
contention,
but
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
in
an
opinion
file
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
tobacco
is
perhaps
the
single
most
troubling
public
health
problem
our
nation
faces
today,
according
to
the
fda’s
findings
more
than
400,000
americans
die
each
year
from
tobacco
related
illnesses
such
as
cancer,
respiratory
illnesses
and
heart
disease.
indeed
tobacco
use
is
the
leading
cause
of
preventable
death
in
the
united
states
resulting
in
more
deaths
annually
than
aids,
car
accidents,
alcohol,
homicides,
illegal
drug,
suicides
and
fires
combined.
but
no
matter
how
important
the
issue
a
federal
administrative
agency
seeks
to
address,
its
power
to
regulate
in
a
public
interest
must
always
be
grounded
in
a
valid
grant
of
authority
from
congress.
and
in
examining
the
act
as
a
whole
as
well
as
congress’
more
specific
efforts
to
address
the
problem
of
tobacco
and
health
it
is
clear
that
congress
never
intended
to
delegate
to
the
fda
the
authority
to
regulate
tobacco.
first,
fda
jurisdiction
over
tobacco
is
incompatible
with
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act's
over
all
regulatory
scheme.
a
fundamental
precept
of
the
act
is
that
all
drugs
or
devices
must
be
safe
and
effective
for
their
intended
use
to
obtain
fda
approval.
the
fda’s
findings
concerning
the
health
hazards
of
tobacco
demonstrate
however,
that
tobacco
products
are
not
safe
and
effective
for
any
use.
accordingly,
were
tobacco
products
with
in
the
fda’s
jurisdiction,
they
would
have
to
be
removed
form
the
market
entirely,
but
congress’
tobacco-specific
statutes
are
expressly
premised
on
the
continued
sale
of
tobacco
products.
they
therefore
foreclose
a
ban.
to
avoid
this
dilemma,
the
fda
has
found
that
tobacco
products
are
actually
safe
under
the
act
because
in
its
opinion
banning
them
would
cause
greater
harm
then
leaving
them
on
the
market.
but
the
act
requires
the
fda
to
conclude
that
the
drug
or
device
is
safe,
not
that
one
remedial
measure
taken
by
the
agency
is
less
dangerous
than
another,
that
is
to
permit
a
product
to
be
sold,
the
fda
must
determine
that
at
least
for
some
consumers
the
therapeutic
benefits
from
using
it
outweigh
its
risks
to
health.
the
fda
cannot
make
such
a
finding
for
tobacco
products,
because
according
to
its
own
findings
cigarettes
and
smokeless
tobacco
are
an
unsafe
means
to
obtaining
any
benefit
or
pharmacological
effect.
the
inescapable
conclusion
is
that
they
are
not
devices
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
if
tobacco
products
cannot
be
used
safely
for
any
therapeutic
purpose,
and
yet
they
cannot
be
banned,
they
just
don’t
fit
within
the
fda’s
jurisdiction.
moreover,
congress
has
specifically
addressed
the
problem
of
tobacco
and
health
in
a
manner
that
precludes
any
role
for
fda
regulation.
since
1965,
congress
has
enacted
six
separate
statutes
addressed
to
the
marketing
and
sale
of
tobacco
products.
that
legislation
establishes
a
distinct
scheme
for
the
regulation
of
cigarettes
and
smokeless
tobacco
that
focuses
on
product
labeling
and
advertising.
as
congress
enacted
this
legislation
each
time
the
fda
consistently,
repeatedly,
and
resolutely
stated
that
it
had
no
authority
to
regulate
tobacco.
indeed
from
the
enactment
of
the
first
pure
food
and
drug
act
in
1908
until
this
rule
making
preceding,
the
fda
never
want
stated
it
had
such
jurisdiction
and
in
passing
these
tobacco-specific
statutes
congress
several
times
explicitly
considered
and
rejected
bills
that
would
have
granted
the
fda
this
authority.
in
fact
congress
consistently
evidence
its
intent
to
preclude
any
agency
from
exercising
significant
policy-making
authority
in
this
area.
congress
has
expressly
preempted
any
other
regulation
of
tobacco
product
labeling
even
though
the
regulation
of
labeling
is
a
central
aspect
of
fda
oversight.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
evident
that
congress
never
intended
the
fda
to
have
the
power
to
regulate
tobacco
and
instead
ratify
the
fda’s
long-held
position
that
it
lacks
such
jurisdiction.
we
do
not
question
the
gravity
of
the
issue
that
the
fda
has
sought
to
address.
the
fda
has
demonstrated
that
tobacco
use
particularly
among
children
and
adolescents
is
a
very
serious
problem.
but
in
pursuing
its
mandate
to
promote
public
health,
the
fda
may
only
exercise
the
authority
that
it
has
been
granted
by
congress.
in
reading
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
as
a
whole
and
in
light
of
congress'
more
specific
tobacco
legislation,
we
find
it
clear
that
for
better
or
for
worse
congress
has
not
given
the
fda
the
power
to
regulate
tobacco.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
