mr.
richard
m.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
solicitor
general
was
not
entirely
accurate
in
stating
our
position.
we
do
contend
that
the
tobacco-specific
statutes
preclude
fda
from
exercising
jurisdiction,
and
that's
an
argument
independent
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
arguments.
i
want
to
pick
up
on
the
answers
to
the
questions
from
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia.
as
to
the
scope
of
fda
jurisdiction
and
the
need
for
addiction,
i'm
going
to
read
from
the
passage
in
the
final
rule,
page
44678,
fda
speaking.
the
nature
of
a
product's
effect
on
the
structure
or
function
of
the
body,
therapeutic
or
nontherapeutic,
beneficial
or
adverse,
thus,
does
not
determinate
fda's
jurisdiction.
the
relevant
inquiry
is
simply
whether
a
product
has
an
effect
on
the
structure
or
any
function
of
the
body.
so
they
don't
need
addiction.
their
position
is
that
any
effect,
even
an
adverse
one,
brings
a
product
within
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes,
has
to...
yes.
there
has
to
be
an
intent,
but
for
them...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes.
well,
it's
one
of
the
key
questions,
justice
stevens,
but
for
them...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
do
not...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no,
there's
not
an
intent
here.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
think
not
because
the...
because,
again,
the
tobacco-specific
statutes
would
preclude
fda
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no.
i
think
when
the...
i
think
the...
as
in
estate
of
romani,
the
issue
of
fda
jurisdiction
had
not
been
determined
favorably...
in
favor
of
jurisdiction
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
tobacco-specific
statutes.
so
it's
a
question
of
harmonizing
the
statutes,
reading
them
together,
and
these
statutes
cannot
be
harmonized
consistent
with
fda
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes,
with
an
addendum
that
there
are
then
multiple
statutes,
most
of
which
are
not
administered
by
fda,
so
that
deference
under
chevron
would
not
be
appropriate,
and
even
at
chevron
step
one,
before
the
enactment
of
the
tobacco-specific
statutes,
we
still
have
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
not
being
able
to
accommodate
these
products.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
they
did
not
amend
it.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
because
when
you...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well,
there's
more...
there...
that...
that's
part
of
our
position.
there's
more
to
it
than
that.
these
products
simply,
as
justice
o'connor
noted,
don't
fit
into
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
there's
an
array
of
health
and
safety
statutes
in
this
country.
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
is
unique
among
them
in
that
it
requires,
as
the
drugs
and
devices,
the
weighing
of
benefits
to
health
against
risk.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
there's
no...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
we
don't
need
them,
but
they're
very
helpful
to
us.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no.
i...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
would...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
our
argument
has
multiple
parts.
i
would
submit
that
the
tobacco-specific
statutes
are
the
most
relevant
because
they're
the
ones
that
tell
us
how
congress
has
dealt
with
tobacco
and
health,
how
congress
wants
these
products...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
it's...
it's
contrary
to
the
facts,
however.
let
me
read
a
passage
from
the
1964
surgeon
general's
report.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yeah.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
the
intent
is
derived
from
the
claims
in
the
marketplace...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
which
have
been
essentially...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
the
same,
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well,
we
can
win
without
them.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
that's
in
the
fda
regulation.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
right.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
is
it
possible
that
there
was
a
change...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
in
subjective
intent?
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes.
is
there
an
fda
finding
on
that?
no.
is
subjective
intent
relevant
under
the
statute?
i
would
submit
not.
the
fda
regulation,
as
you
point
out,
justice
scalia,
requires
an
objective
intent.
that's
a
very
unusual
term.
it
didn't
say
objective
evidence
of
intent.
it
says
an
objective
intent.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
object...
evidence
of
objective
intent
by
its
very
nature
must
surface
in
the
marketplace.
the
evidence
of
objective
intent
is
claims
and
representations
in
the
marketplace...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
and
it's
public.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
there...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
would...
the...
the
claim
establishes
the
objective
intent.
in
the
case
of
aspirin,
it
was
established
by
claims
of
pain,
but...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
it...
no,
it
does
not
fit
within
everything
else
in
the
statute,
justice
breyer.
the...
the
approval
process,
for
example,
for
drugs
and
devices
requires
a
finding
of
effectiveness,
and
effectiveness,
even
before
the
1962
drug
amendments,
was
an
element
of
safety.
if
a
product
does
not
purport
to
provide
a
benefit
to
health
or
body
functioning
or
structure,
there
is
nothing
to
evaluate
for
effectiveness.
there
is
nothing
to
weigh
against
risks...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
in
evaluating
safety.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
we
are
bound
on
this
record
by
fda's
findings,
and
fda
found
these
products
unsafe.
and
indeed,
it
said
in
the...
in
the
proposed
rule
at
page
41348
that
if
these
were
to
be
regulated
as
drugs,
they
would
have
to
be
found
safe
or
found
generally
recognized
as
safe
and...
and
i
quote,
"neither
of
these
outcomes
can
be
viewed
as
a
realistic
possibility.
"
close
quote,
no
realistic
possibility
of
finding
these
products
safe.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
submit
not.
the...
there...
there
is
no
general
public
health
standard
under
this
statute.
section
903
21
usc
393
requires
fda
to
ensure
that
drugs
are
safe
and
effective,
and
under
section
360(c)(a)(2)(a),
that
means
for
the
people
who
use
them,
and
the
statute
also
requires
that
there
be
a
reasonable
assurance
that
medical
devices
are
safe
and
effective.
this
court
reviewed
the
standard
for
medical
device
approval
in
medtronic.
it's
a
rigorous
standard.
it
relates
to
the
health
of
the
individuals
who
will
use
the
product.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
i
don't...
i...
i...
that's
not
the
way
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
requires
drugs
and
devices
to
be
regulated.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
if
it
does
not
purport
to
have
a
health
benefit,
it's
not
subject
to
regulation
under
the
fdca,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
escapes
regulation.
it
could
be
regulated
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
as
in
fact
it
is.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
not
by
the
fda.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
there
are
thousands
of
products
that
are
potentially
harmful
or
injurious
that
are...
that's
why
congress...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
even
ones
that
can
be
ingested
into
the
body.
household
cleaning
fluids,
for
example,
can
be
ingested
by
children,
for
example.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
street
drugs.
if
somebody
puts
out
a
street
drug
and
says
this
will...
is
for
pleasure,
that's
not
regulated
by
fda.
that's
regulated
by
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
oh,
no.
if
there's
a
theory
that
it's
for
health
benefits,
then
certainly
fda
does
regulate
it.
that's
where
fda
comes
in,
where
there
is
a
claim
of
health
benefit.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well,
there's...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
there's
no
finding
by
fda
that
any
cigarette
manufacturer
has
intended
to
provide
a
health
benefit.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
fda
has
said
that
those
are
effects.
it
has
not
said
that
those
are
significant
enough
to
be
beneficial.
there's
no
such
finding.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
we'd
have
a
different
case.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
they
would
have
to
have
legally
sufficient
evidence
of
intent,
and...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
that
requires
a
claim.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
oh.
fda
says
at
page
45194
in
the
final
rule
that
they
are
not
relying
on
any
claims,
anything
on
the
package
labeling...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
any
representations
made.
they're
relying
entirely
on
other
kinds
of
evidence.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no.
i
think...
i
think
those
statutes...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes,
it
does,
and
i
think
it...
technically,
you
would
say
it
precludes
a
finding
that
a...
that
a
tobacco
product
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
fda
under
the
definitions.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
with
a
claim
of
the
type
you
describe?
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
sounds
like
alcohol.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
as
a
drug?
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no.
i
would...
i
would
say
they
could
not.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
there
are
other
statutes.
if
i
put
out...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes,
because...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
think
i
understand.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
the
purpose
of
the
act,
separate
from
other
health...
there
are
many
other
health
and
safety
statutes.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
regulate
products
that
purport
to
provide
benefits
to
body
structure
or
functioning.
if
all...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
if
all
a
product
does
is
present
risks
and
some
other
kinds
of
benefits,
non-health
benefits,
then
you
can
regulate
it
under
the
consumer
product
safety
act
and...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
unless
there's
a
claim
that
it
keeps
your
hand
warm,
nobody
would
know.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
it's
the...
it's
the...
and
the
nature
of
the
claim.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
there's
got
to
be
a
claim,
and
it's
got
to
be
of
a...
of
a
benefit.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
if
there
is
a
claim
of
a
non-trivial...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
and
all
of
which,
just
so
i
have
the
question
clear...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i
don't
think
that
satisfying
addiction
is
sufficient.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
if
you...
if...
if
you
have
a
product
that...
that
makes
a
claim
to
stimulate
or
to
sedate,
that's
within
fda's
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
it's
not
a
tobacco
product.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
we
don't
have
the
tobacco-specific
statutes.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
because
the
way
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
has
always
worked
is
that
the
initiative
for
defining
the
purpose,
the
use
of
the
product
is
with
the
manufacturer.
it's
done
through
the
approval
process.
when
the
manufacturer
submits
the
application
to
fda,
it
covers
not
only
the
product.
it
covers
the
proposed
labeling
for
the
product,
which
specifies
what
the
product
is
to
be
for...
is
to
be
used
for,
and
thereby
specifies
the
dimension
of
efficacy
that's
to
be
assessed
by
fda.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no,
i
say
it's
the
same.
it's
not
objective
evidence
of
intent.
it's
objective
intent,
and
i
say
it's
a
strict
analogy
to
congressional
intent.
like
congressional
intent,
it's
not
what's
in
somebody's
mind.
it's
what's
written
on
public
documents
that
everybody
can
see
and
everybody
can
know
about.
we
talk
about
the
intent
of...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
if
you...
if
you
go
through
the
various
sentences
in
the
regulations,
fda
says
objective
intent
is
determined
by
the
representations
of
the
manufacturer
or
other
vendor.
in
the
absence
of
such
representations,
we
can
look
to
objective
circumstances.
fda
very
easily...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
they
come
into
play
only
where
there
is
no
intended
use
established
by
other
representations.
when
the
case
of...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
it's
a
default
rule.
in
the
case
of
tobacco
products,
we
have
had
for
decades,
time
out
of
mind,
representations
that
their
intended
use
is
for
smoking
pleasure...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
and
taste
and
so
on.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
just
reading
it.
i
mean,
it's
in
the
regulations.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
it's
in...
it's
in
the
regulations.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
this
is...
it's
in
the
regulations.
the
wordsor
words
of
similar
import
refer
to
the
objective
intent
of
the
persons
legally
responsible
for
the
labeling
of
the
drugs.
next
sentence.
the
intent
is
determined
by
such
persons'
expressions
or
may
be
shown
by
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
distribution
of
the
article.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
right.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i'm
just...
i'm...
that's
how
it
has
been
understood
for
decades.
that...
there
are
many
drugs,
for
example...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well,
there
are
many
drugs
and
devices,
some
of
the
most
important
in
all
of
medicine,
that
have
off-label
uses,
that
are
not
covered
by
the
representations
by
the
manufacturer,
that
are
widespread,
common,
foreseeable,
and
medically
necessary...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
to
save
lives.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes.
otherwise,
all
of
those
products
become
unlawful...
unlawful.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
it
may
well
be.
in
the
case
of...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
in
the
case...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
take
a
concrete
example.
children's
aspirin
is...
is
virtually...
has
virtually
no
use
for
children
these
days
because
of
reye's
syndrome,
is
widely
used
by
adults
on
the
advice
of
physicians.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
except
if...
if
fda
finds...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
well,
they
can.
they
can.
fda
can
always
determine
that
overall
it
is
an
unsafe
product,
taking
everything
into
account.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
you...
you
can
take
the
adverse...
yes.
you
can
take
adverse
effects...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
no,
no.
fda's
safety
assessment
is
with
respect
to
whether
the
benefits
of
the
intended
use
outweigh
the
risks
from...
from
all
uses
of
the
product.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes,
but
without
specifying
what
it's
for.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
they
do
regulate
it.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
you
need...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
you
need
the
wordin
order
to
make
the
statute
workable.
you
need
it
for
several
reasons.
you
need
it
to
avoid
the...
making
all
drugs
and
devices
with
off-label
uses
unlawful
and
depriving
the
medical
community
of
those
products.
second,
you
need...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
but
that...
that's
got
no
textual
basis
either,
with
due
respect.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
let
me
say...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i'd
say
two...
two
things.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
let
me...
it's
not
a
repeal,
but
i...
it's...
it's
analogous
methodologically
to
estate
of
romani
and
to
u.s.
v.
fausto.
you
have
multiple
statutes
and
you
need
to
read
them
together
to
make
sense.
what
i
would
say
1331
shows,
that
there's
more
at
stake
here
than
health.
health
problem
is
obviously
critical,
but
congress
in
1331
made
it
clear
that
it's
balancing
and
making
tradeoffs
among
a
number
of
interests
in
addition
to
health.
economic
interests,
interests
in
informed
adult
choice,
those
are
beyond
the
ken
of
fda.
as
commissioner
kessler
said,
the
regulation
of
tobacco
raises,
in
his
words,
societal
issues
of
great
complexity
and
magnitude.
those
are
not
for
fda.
those
are
for
congress.
congress
addressed
them
in
the
federal
cigarette
labelling
and
advertising
act,
and
it
told
how
it
was
going
to
do
it
and
how...
how
these
products
are
to
be
regulated
in
1331.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
i...
i
would
say
there
was
no
original
grant
to
fda.
the
possibility
of
an
original
grant,
the
theoretical
possibility
has
been
eliminated...
was
eliminated
in
1965.
give
you
one
other
example.
fda
acknowledges
that
the
cigarette
and
smokeless
statutes
prevented
from
requiring
health
information
on
packages
of
tobacco
products.
these
are
products
sold
over
the
counter.
health
information
on
drugs
and
devices
sold
over
the
counter
is
the
predominant
way
that
fda
ensures
that
these
products
are
safe
and
effective.
if
you
take
that
away
from
fda,
as
congress
did
with
respect
to
tobacco
products,
there's
no
way
to
ensure
as
a
practical
matter
that
these
products
be
safe
and
effective.
it
would
make
no
sense
for
congress
to
delegate
to
fda
authority
to
regulate
tobacco
products
as
over-the-counter
drugs
and
devices,
but
disable
fda
from
using
the
primary
tool
to
ensure
the
safety
of
these
products.
you
go
into
a
drug
store.
you
pick
up
a
drug
or
a
device.
it
will
tell
you
in
great
detail
how
to
use
it
safely
and
effectively,
and
fda
is
disabled
from
using
that
core
power
with
respect
to
these
products.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
yes,
i
do,
and...
and...
and
that
determination
existed
even
in
1938.
in
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
of
1938,
which
is
cited
on
page
10
of
the
philip
morris
lorillard
brief,
congress
in
section
311,
which
today
is
7
united
states
code
1311,
found
that
the
marketing
of
tobacco
is
one
of
the
greatest
basic
industries
of
the
united
states,
and
further
found
that
stable
conditions
therein
are
necessary
to
the
general
welfare.
that
finding
is
absolutely
incompatible
not
only
with
a
ban,
but
with
a
delegation
to
an
agency
of
authority
to
ban.
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
we
permit
adults...
mr.
richard
m.
cooper
and
others
to
do
that.
i
would
submit
that
fda's
assertion
of
jurisdiction
here
is
lawless,
and
however
admirable
its
intentions,
its
motive,
it
is
setting
aside
established
principles
of
law.
it
is
doing
real
harm
to
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
potentially
expanding
the
agency's
jurisdiction
beyond
limit,
and
severely
weakening
the
consumer
protection
provisions
of
the
act
in
the
interest
of
enhancing
the
agency's
discretion.
that
congress
provided
for
the
way
these
products
are
to
be
regulated,
and
if
there
are
new
facts,
the
precedent
of
1964
should
be
followed
when
the
surgeon
general
made
his
report
to
congress
and
went
and
testified
and
congress
enacted
a
new
statute.
that's
what
should
happen
here,
and
fda's
assertion
of
authority
should
not
stand.
thank
you.
