not
to
get
cancer,
but
to
have
an
effect
on
the
body
and
the
very
same
effects
on
the
body
that
are
now
being
described
in
detail
by
the
addictive
mechanism.
people
have
always
smoked
to
get
relaxation
or
to
keep
going
under
pressure.
we...
we
may
have
hit
some
question
about
the
strict
chemical
mechanism
by
which
the
effect
is
achieved,
but
certainly
from
the
beginning,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
doubt
that
people
were
taking
these
things
for
their
effect
on
the
body
and
that
they
were
being
sold
for
people
for
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
an
effect
on
the
body.
justice
david
h.
souter
general...
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
accept
your
argument,
and...
i...
i
guess
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
i
accept
your
argument
on
every
one
of
the
technical
points
that
has
been
raised
here,
but
it
still
does
not
resolve
the
case
in
my
mind
because
i
have,
i
guess,
a
chevron
level
ii
basic
question.
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
this
is
a
chevron
case,
and
i
agree
with
you
that...
that
the...
that
the...
the...
the
agency
has
a
potential
role
here
in...
in
completing
or
clarifying
a
statutory
scheme
that
is
not
totally
clear.
where
i
have
my
trouble,
when
we
get
to
chevron
ii
and...
part
ii,
and
say,
is
this
reasonable,
is
not
with
respect
to
any
one
of
the
technical
problems
that
have
been
raised
and
i
think
in...
in
large
part
answered
by
you,
but
in
the
totality
of
them.
number
one,
there's...
there's
no
question
that
the
paradigm
examples
of
fda
regulation
is
regulation
of
substances
that
are
put
forward
for
purposes
of...
of
health
or...
or
curing
disease
or
whatnot,
even
though
there
are
exceptions.
number
two,
it
seems
to
me
the
paradigm
way
that
the
fda
goes
about
it
is
on
a
claims-made
basis.
there
are
exceptions
to
it,
and
you're
entirely
right
under...
under
intended
use,
but
most
of
the
time
what's
going
on
is
a
response
to
a
claims-made
kind
of
scheme.
number
three,
for
a
long
period
of
time,
the
agency,
for
whatever
reason,
said
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
this.
it
said
that
despite,
at
least
in
my
judgment,
the
fact
that
they
could
certainly
bring
cigarettes
within
the
definition
ofeven
if
they
weren't
sure
of
the
mechanism.
number
four,
the
agency
at
this
point
at
least
is
saying
we
will
regulate,
but
right
now
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
balance
of
goodness
in
favor
of
cigarettes,
so
we're
not
going
to
ban,
and
that
seems
in
traditional
practice
to
be
a
kind
of
unusual
analysis.
and
finally,
given
this...
this,
in
effect,
absence
of
fda
jurisdiction,
the
congress
has
gone
in,
not
with
a
global
regulatory
scheme,
but
with
a
lot
of
congressional
statutes
that
attack
various
parts
of
the
cigarette
problem.
when
you
take
all
of
that
together,
what
bothers
me
about
the
government's
position
is
that
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
it
is
reasonable
at
this
point
for
the
government
to
construe
its
statutes
in
a
way
that
asserts
regulation.
it's
the...
it's
the
global
problem,
not
the
technical
problems,
that
bother
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
know
we
can't
just
go
with
the
plain
language
of
the
definitions
because
they
would
lead
infinitely
out.
you'd
be
regulating
clothing...
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
simply
went
by
the...
the
definition
alone.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the...
in
the
bodies...
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
make
of
the
regulation
which
has
apparently
been
on
the
books
for
decades
which
we
have
referred
to
or
the
fda
has
referred
to
as
objective
intent?
that
seems
to
be
an
alternative
to
a
claims-made
scheme.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
certainly
a
very
obscure
way
of
referring
to
an
express
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
objective
circumstances
are
the
subject
of
justice
breyer's
question.
why
are
not
these
objective
circumstances
subject
to
fda
notice
even
though
there
is
no
express
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
and
i...
i
think
this
has
passed
over
me
because
i
didn't
know
it
was
coming.
what
is
the
textual
basis
for
your
saying
it
is
simply
a
default
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is...
what
is
the
textual
phrase,
if
you
can
give
it
to
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,does
not
sound
to
me...
justice
david
h.
souter
like
a
default
rule.
it
sounds
like
an
alternative.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it's
been
understood
is
the
default.
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
your
argument,
i
guess,
is
if
you're
going
to
preserve
the...
the
concept
of
off-label
uses,
you've
got
to
take
this
default.
