chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
really
take
an
awful
long
time
to
answer
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when...
when
a
member
of
the
court
asks
you
a
question,
it's
better
to
give
the
answer
first
and
then
explain,
rather
than
give
the
answer
after
a
fairly
long
explanation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
certainly
wasn't
the
first
time
that
that
scientific
consensus
evolved,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
surgeon
general's
warning
date...
dates
back
to
the
early
'60s.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nobody
believed
them.
i
mean...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
not?
thirty
years
ago...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
would
have
suggested
they
exercise
jurisdiction
over
cigarettes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
waxman.
mr.
cooper,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

chief
justice

h.

right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

not?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
and
what...
what
is
the...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
most...
most
children's
aspirin
says
on
it,
also
for
adult
aspirin
regime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
basically,
there's
kind
of
a
legal
stenosis
going
on
here;
that
because
of
everything
that
has
happened,
the
original
grant
to
the...
to
the
fda
has
been
somewhat
narrowed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
mr.
cooper.
general
waxman,
you
have
2

chief
justice
