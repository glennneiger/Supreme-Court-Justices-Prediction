justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
we
don't
know
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
now,
do
you...
but
the
question,
as
i
understood
it,
was
do
you
think
there
is
any
prospect
of
the
agency
being
able
to
make
such
a
statement...
justice
antonin
scalia
under
any
classification
that
this
stuff
is
safe?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
have
all
of
the
harmful
effects
that...
that
is
the
purpose
of...
of
its
distribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
safety?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
know
to
whom...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
whom
it
should
not
be
prohibited...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
my
only
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's...
justice
antonin
scalia
an
understanding,
i
might
add,
that...
that
had
been
conveyed
to
congress
by...
by
the
heads
of
the
fda
on
numerous
occasions
when
congress
had
various
pieces
of
legislation
dealing
with
tobacco
before
it.
it
seems
to
me
congress
enacted
these
statutes
on
the
assumption
of
the
state
of
the
law
that...
that
they
had
been
assured
by
the
agency
itself
existed
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
the
former
is
concerned,
nobody
believed
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
why
is
the
addictiveness
alone
necessary
for
the
fda's
jurisdiction?
wasn't
it
clear
from
the
early
'60s?
indeed,
wasn't
it
clear
in
1938?
wasn't
it
clear
much
earlier
than
that?
states
began...
some
states
had...
a
number
of
states
banned
cigarettes
as
early
as
1900,
and...
and
those
other
harmful
effects,
whether
the
addiction
was
obvious
or
not,
were
surely
well
known,
and
wouldn't
they
alone
have
been
enough
to
require
the
fda
to
come
in?
do
you
need
addiction
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
addiction
is
not
the
only
one.
there
are
other
effects
that
were
clear,
at
least
from
the
surgeon
general's
report,
harmful
effects
upon
the
body.
you
did
not
need
addiction
in
addition
to
that,
and
the
only
novel
scientific
findings
you've
brought
to
our
attention
that
antedate
the
surgeon
general's
report
are
the
scientific
findings
of...
of
addiction,
although
frankly
most
people
suspected
that
before
then
anyway.
so
why
at
the
time
of
the
surgeon
general's
report,
which,
you
know,
resulted
in
a
requirement
to
be
posted
on
cigarette
packages...
caution:
the
surgeon
general
has
determined
it
to
be
harmful
to
your
health...
why
wasn't
that
fully
enough
at
that
point
for
the
fda
to...
to
regulate
justice
antonin
scalia
although
they
claim
they
could
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
butwhatever
it
was,
was
marketed
as
a
means
of
altering
your
body
chemistry.
the...
the
manufacturer
said
take
this
and
your
body
chemistry
will
be
altered,
so
you...
you
can
eat
just
as
much
and
not...
and
not
gain
weight.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
here
is
that...
that
this
is
not
what...
what
the
cigarette
makers
advertised.
so
what
you
really
need
is
an
example
where
it...
you
know,
it
isn't
advertised
on
that
basis,
but...
but
people
enjoyed
using
it,
and
the
reason
they
enjoyed
using
it
happened
to
be
that
chemical
change
which
was
not
advertised.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is...
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is...
why
is
that?
i...
i
don't...
what
do
you
mean,?
ll
it
has
to
be
is
dangerous,
harmful
to
human
health.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be...
that
may
well
be
the
result
with
respect
to
alcohol,
too,
and,
you
know,
we
tried
a
ban
of
that
and
decided
forget
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
although
there
may
have
been
chevron
play
in
the
joints
originally
in
the
statute
after
there's
other
legislation
which
has
to
be
taken
into
account,
step
one
of
chevron
is
no
longer
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
don't
really
respond
to
my
question.
why
don't
you...
why
don't
you...
why
don't
you
answer
his
question
which
relates
not
to
claims
in
the
marketplace,
but
to
what...
i
know
some...
some
of
the
literature
talks
about
objective
intent.
i
have
no
idea
what
objective
intent
is,
but
let's
assume...
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
i
understand
the
question...
is
never
mind
what
the
claims
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
has...
isn't
it
possible
that
there
was
an...
a
change
in
the
subjective
intent
of...
of
those
who
marketed
the
cigarettes,
that
only
at
a
more
recent
date
was
it
clear
that
it
was
their
intent
to
make
physical
alterations...
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
have
aspirin?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
it...
i
guess
on
the
theory
that
justice
breyer
is
inquiring
about,
the
fda
could...
could
approve
the...
the
sale
of...
of
cocaine,
and
in
effect
adopt
the...
the
theory
of
many
people
who
want
legalization
of
drugs;
that
the
overall
social
benefit
of
legalizing
them
will...
will
outweigh
the
individual
harm.
you'll
have
much
less
crime
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
suppose
if
the
fda
has...
can
do
this
kind
of
a
thing
with
cigarettes,
it
could
do
it
with...
with
marijuana,
with
any
of
the
other
drugs
that...
you
know,
overall
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
free
market
in
this
stuff,
and
some
people
would
be
hurt,
but
the
society
at
large
would
be
helped.
i
guess
this
is
the
theory
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
disagree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
some
of
these
so-called...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
primary
purpose...
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
this...
mr.
cooper,
are
you
going
to
talk
about
your
statutory
argument?
you
say
you
have
a
whole
separate
basis
that...
that
exists
separately.
frankly,
my...
my
whole
concern
with
this
thing
is...
is
that
even
assuming
that
originally
the
food
and
drug
act
could
have
been
interpreted
to...
to
apply
to
cigarettes,
there's
a
lot
of
water
over
the
dam
since
then,
including
representations
by...
by
commissioners
which
have
been
the
basis
for
other
federal
legislation.
now,
do
you
want...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
discuss
what
that
other
federal
legislation
is...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
you
think
it's
inconsistent
with...
with
the
food
and
drug
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
conceivable.
i
guess
downhill
skiing
is
not
good
for
your
health
either,
and...
and
we
do
allow
that,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about...
about
the
doctors
using...
using
medicines
for
non-prescribed
uses?
what...
how
do
you
explain
that?
