mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
following
the
most
extensive
rulemaking
in
its
history,
the
food
and
drug
administration
concluded
that
nicotine
in
cigarettes
and
smokeless
tobacco
is
highly
addictive
and
has
three
other
strong
pharmacological
effects
on
the
body
as
a
sedative,
a
stimulant,
and
an
appetite
suppressant.
the
fda
found
that
the
manufacturers
know
this,
that
they
know
that
consumers
predominantly
use
their
products
to
obtain
these
effects,
and
indeed
that
they
engineer
their
products
to
deliver
the
precise
doses
of
nicotine
that
consumers
need
to
obtain
its
powerful
effects.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is,
whether
given
those
findings,
the
fda
validly
concluded
that
these
products
are
drug-delivery
devices
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
the
act
defines
drugs
and
devices
to
include,
quote,
"articles...
other
than
food...
intended
to
affect
the
structure
or
any
function
of
the
body.
"
and
the
fda
found
that
nicotine
is
intended
to
do
so
in
four
quintessentially
drug-like
ways.
like
no
doz,
nicotine
acts
as
a
stimulant.
like
valium,
it
acts
as
a
sedative.
like
dexatrim,
it
suppresses
appetite,
and
like
methadone,
it's
used
to
satisfy
an
addiction.
the
fda
also
found
that
cigarettes
and
smokeless
tobacco
have
the
classic
characteristics
of
articles
subject
to
regulation
by
the
fda.
they
are
taken
within
the
human
body.
they
deliver
a
pharmacologically
active
substance
to
the
bloodstream.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
traditionally,
they
are
not,
and
it
is
our
submission
that
that
does
not
in
any
way...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
affect
the
definition
of
whether
they...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
are
drugs
or
devices.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the
fda
is...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i...
may
i
respectfully
dissent...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
and
explain
why?
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
act
requires
that
with
respect
to
devices...
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
combination
product
which
the
fda,
beginning
with
the
1990
amendments,
was
authorized
to
regulate,
that
is,
a
product
that...
that
combines
drug
components
and
device
components,
but
this
combination
product
regulated
under
the
agency's
device
authorities
must
be
found
and
marketed
under
conditions,
distributed
under
conditions
that
the
fda
finds
to
be
reasonably
safe
and
effective
for
its
intended
uses.
with
respect
to
devices
that
preexisted
the
enactment
of
the
1976
device
amendments
and
the
1990
combination
product
amendments,
the
act
contemplates
and
requires
that
after
the
fda
asserts
jurisdiction
and
regulation
over
a
particular
device,
but
not
before,
the
fda
will
engage
in
a
classification
process
for
the
devices
which
is
explained
in
great
detail
in
the
act
at
section
360(c),
360(d),
and
360(e),
and
in
that
classification
process,
which
will
take
place
with
respect
to
these
products,
the
agency
will
be
required
to
determine
what
controls
and
under
what
conditions
these
articles
may
be
marketed
and
distributed
with
reasonable
assurances
of
safety
and
effectiveness.
now,
at
this
point...
we
have
not
gotten
to
the
classification
point
yet,
but
at
this
point,
where
the
agency
has
determined
in
response
to
petitions
and
in
response
to
the
overwhelming
scientific
data
that
it
can
and
should
assert
certain
regulatory
controls,
it
has
determined
to...
to
regulate
these
products
as
restricted
devices
under
its
authority
given
to
it
in
1976
and
reflected
in
section
360(j)(e).
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
answer
is
the
agency...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
agency...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
agency
has
made...
and
the
agency
is
required
to
make...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
agency...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
agency
not
only
thinks,
but
the
agency
has
explained
in
very
considerable
length
in
its
final
rule
that
it...
it
believes
at
this
point
that
it
will
be
able
to
make
determinations
with
respect
to
both
effectiveness
and
safety.
with
respect
to
effectiveness,
it
has
found
that
for
at
least
one
of
the
four
known
pharmacological
effects,
that
is,
addiction,
that
cigarette
smoke
and
the
nicotine
in
cigarettes
is
in
fact
quite
effective
for
sustaining
addiction,
and
it
may
also
find
through
the
classification
process
that
it
is
effective
for
the
other
chemical
effects,
that
is,
to...
to
provide
sedation,
stimulation,
and
weight...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
there...
there
is
no
question.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
no
question.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
now,
with
respect
to
safety,
the
act
requires
that
safety
or,
with
the
case
of
device,
the
reasonable
assurance
of
safety
be
determined
in
the
classification
process
by
means
of
a
weighing
process
that
is
specified
in
the
statute
and
was
outlined
by
this
court
in
rutherford
in
which
the
agency
weighs
not
with
respect
to
the
world
at
large,
as
the
respondents
claim,
but
with
respect
to
the...
the
public
that
consumes
these
products,
the
risks
versus
benefits
of
using...
of
making
these
products
available
versus
taking
them
off
the
market.
now,
in
its
rulemaking,
the
agency
was
careful
to
say
that
it
was
not
making
a
final
determination
about
this,
but
based
on
all
of
the
evidence
that
it
had
reviewed
to
date,
both
the
scientific
data
with
respect
to
the
properties
of
nicotine
and
the
properties
of
these
devices
and
the
epidemiological
and
behavioral
science
data
about
why
people
use
it
and
at
what
stage
they
use
it,
it
made
a
determination
that
on
balance,
the
appropriate
means
of
regulating
this
product
was
twofold.
one,
because
almost
all
people
who
become
addicted
smokers
or
addicted
users
of
smokeless
tobacco
begin
when
they
are
children
or
adolescents...
and
the
data
is
overwhelming
on
this...
the...
the
distribution
or
sale
to
those
people
should
be
prohibited.
they
are
likely
to
be
unsafe
for
those
people
for
all
purposes...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
and
second...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
i'll...
i...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
i
thought
you
would,
and
i'm
coming...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
coming
right
to
it.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
with...
with...
i
apologize,
but
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
agency
made
a
determination
with
respect...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
to
two
categories
of
people.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the
short
explanation
is
that
for
a
portion
of
the
population,
that
is,
those
under
18,
the
agencies
made
a
preliminary
safety-ness
or
reasonable
assurance
of
safety-ness
determination
that
a
ban
was
required.
with
respect
to
persons
over
18,
the
majority
of
whom
the
agency
found
are
in
fact
addicted
to
these
products,
the
agency
concluded
that
a
ban
would
be
more
dangerous
to
these
people
than
allowing
these
people,
most
of
whom
are
addicted,
to
continue
to
use
the
products
pending
a...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
final
review.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
but
with
all
respect,
justice
o'connor,
the
agency,
first
of
all,
has
made
only
a
preliminary
determination
with
respect
to
safety,
and
it
has
made
it
clear
that
if
during
the
classification
process,
which
requires
the
convening
of
panels,
including
representatives
of
the
manufacturers
and
the
scientific
industry,
that
there
are
no
controls
or
restrictions
that
could
make
it
safe,
taking
into
account
the
balance,
a
ban
may
be
required
of
these
products,
and
you
may
have
the
result
that
the
agency,
which
has
concluded
that
that
might...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
what
i...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
with
respect
to
the
prior
statements
and
the
long
assumption
or
assumption
that
didn't
exist,
i
think
in
order
to
go
back
and
understand
what
the
congress
may
or
may
not
have
concluded
in
1938...
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
this
is
a
statute
that
was
not
directed
at
particular
articles,
but
rather
laid
out
general
principles
and
definitions
and
intended
the
agency
to
apply
its
regulatory
authorities
to
those
definitions
where
appropriate...
the
agency,
to
be
sure,
has
stated
repeatedly
before
congress
and
in
the
courts
and
in
the
public
many
times
for
a
long
period
up
until
1995,
that
it
did
not
believe
that
it
had
sufficient
jurisdiction
to
regulate
tobacco
products
absent
claims
made
about
the
effects
that
those
products
would
have
on
the
body,
and
in
order
to
understand
why
that
was
so,
i
think
it's...
it's
probably
best
to
look
at
what
caused
the
agency
to
change
its
mind.
this
is
an
agency
that
is
required
to
act
on
the
basis,
first
of
all,
of
scientific
data,
not
general
understandings,
and,
second
of
all,
an
agency
that
is
required
to
act
with
respect
to
not
uses,
but
intended
uses,
and
since
1938,
the
agency
has
had
in
place
a
regulation
that
explains
that...
that
the
manufacturer's
intent
is
to
be
determined
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
it
is
the
intent
that
a
reasonable
fact-finder
would
impute
to
the
manufacturer
based
on
all
of
the
objective
evidence.
now,
in
1995,
the
agency
heard
overwhelming
evidence
and
concluded,
number
one,
that
there
was
an
absolute
scientific
consensus
that
nicotine
is
a
highly
addictive
substance.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it...
it
actually...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
in
1994,
the
chief
executive
officers
of
virtually
all
of
the
respondents
sat
500
yards
from
this
courtroom
and
testified
under
oath
that...
that
nicotine
in
cigarette
products
and
smokeless
products
was
not
addictive
and
that
they
did
not
engineer
their
products
to
manipulate
nicotine
levels
and...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
at
the...
with
all
due
respect,
at
the
time
the
surgeon
general
issued
his
report
in
1994,
the
surgeon
general
found
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
conclude
that
nicotine
was
addictive.
it
was
only
in
1988
that
the
surgeon
general
did
find
that
it
was
addictive,
and
it
was
largely
in
the
early
and
mid-'90s
that
there
became
a
consensus
that
this
product
was
addictive.
the
agency
also
found
and
acted
in
1996...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no,
no.
what
you
need,
justice
scalia,
are
intended
effects.
it's
just
not...
it's
not
just
effects
on
the
structure
or
function
of
the
body.
it
would
have
been
unfair
and
implausible
to
charge
the
manufacturers
with
the
intent
that
people
use
cigarettes
and
smokeless
tobacco
to
get
cancer
and
die
from
emphysema.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i...
with
all
due
respect,
justice
souter,
there
were...
i...
i...
i
can't
place
myself
back
in...
in
1938,
but
reading
some
of
the
materials
that
the
respondents
have
submitted
and
others,
there
were...
it
was
generally
understood
that
people
smoked
because
it
was
soothing
or
because
it
gave
them
status
or...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
and
with
respect
to
that,
again,...
i...
without
repeating
myself,
this
is
an
agency
that
is
mandated
and
expected
to
act
on
the
basis
of
scientific
evidence.
that's
just
the
way
the
fda
works,
and
i
think...
you
know,
in
fact,
the
easiest
way,
at
least
for
me,
to
see
what's
different
now
than...
than
was...
than
was
then...
then...
and
it
is
not
our
submission
that
all
of
a
sudden
in
1996
something
changed.
maybe
the
agency
could
reasonably
have
regulated
this
in
1985,
but
if
you
look
at
actually
the
case
that...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
o'connor...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
no...
no
one
has
ever
seriously
suggested
that
the
fda
exercise
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
horror
movies
or
guns
or
bayonets
or...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
but...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
and...
and
they
would
not
reasonably
have
done
so.
what
the...
and
the
reason...
what
the
agency
does
in
response
to
a
petition
when
deciding
to
exercise
its
regulatory
controls,
is
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
see
whether
it's
covered
and
then
to
do
what
all
other
administrative
agencies
and
indeed
courts
do...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
which
is
to
look...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
that's
a...
that's
a...
that's
a
particularly
hard
question,
justice
kennedy,
because
i'm...
i'm
really
not
conversant
with
when
the
data
became
what.
i...
one
of
the
things
i've
struggled
with
is
the
agency's
1980
determination
that
is
included
as
the
last
document
in
the
joint
appendix
in
which...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
'8.
oh,
for
sure.
i...
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
the
agency...
in
response
to
the
horror
movie
question
and
the
gun
question,
the
agency
looks
first
to
the
language
of
the
act,
the
definitional
sections
and
the
operative
provisions,
to
see
whether
or
not
this
is
something
that
with
respect
to
subsection
(c)
is
intended
to
affect
the
structure
or
any
function
of
the
body.
it
then
does
what
all
agencies
do
and
what
all
courts
do,
which
is
to
look
at
the
practice,
that
is,
does
this
article
and
do
its
intended
effects
resemble
the
kinds
of
articles
and
intended
effects
that
have
always
been
regulated,
the
same
process
that
this
court
150
years
ago
explained
in
trinity
church.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
agency...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
right,
and
they
still
claim
that
based...
that
the
fact
that
cigarette
smoking
is
known
to
cause
cancer
and
emphysema
and
other
dread
diseases,
does
not
give
it
jurisdiction
to
regulate
a
product.
there
are
many
products
that
are
very,
very
dangerous
to
health
that
the
fda
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate.
it
has
jurisdiction...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
it
may
be
wrong,
but
it's...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the...
the
answer
is
yes,
there
are.
i'm
sure
i
can't
recite
anywhere
near
all
of
them,
but
if
you
look
at
a
recent
example,
the
fda
had
regulated
and
permitted
to
be
marketed
a
drug,
i
think,
called
fenfluramine,
which
was
used
to
reduce
weight
in
obese
persons
for
a
short
period
of
time,
and
when
it
became
known
to
the
fda
that
it
was
commonly
being
used
with
another
drug
that
also
starts
withand
was
producing
an
alarming
incidence
of
mitral
heart
valve
failure,
the
fda
contacted
the
manufacturer,
undertook
certain
studies.
the
manufacturer
withdrew
it
from
the
market.
many
of
the
drugs
that
either
are
now
or
at
some
point
have
become
listed
as
controlled
substances,
were
regulated
by
the
fda
long
before
they
became
controlled
and
are
still
regulated
by
the
fda...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
to
the
extent
that
they
have
accepted
medical
uses,
but...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
that...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief...
and
i
can
recount
them
here...
many,
many
instances
of
products
that
the
fda
has
regulated
based
on
their
intended
effects
to
the...
on
the
body
that
aren't
claimed,
and
it
has
been
the
fda's
consistent
interpretation
since
1938
that
intended
use
does
not
equate
to
claimed
use.
it
is
certainly
true
that
most
manufacturers
claim
the
uses
that
they
intend
their
products
to
be
made
for,
but
it
would
be
the
highest
irony
if
you
had
a
product
like
tobacco
that
every...
and
everyone
knows
what
it
is
used
for...
and
today
everyone
knows
that
it
has
intended
effects
on
the
body
that
completely
escape
regulation...
a
claims
requirement
would
allow
a
manufacturer,
for
example,
of
prozac,
just
to
sell
prozac
and
not
make
any
claims
about
it,
or
sell
any
drug
as
a
generic
drug
and
make
no
health
claims,
or
sell
valium
and
say
it...
it's
soothing...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
and
there
would
be
no
regulation.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
justice
souter,
i
think
in
the
time
remaining,
i
guess
the
best
way
that
i
can
answer
the
question
is
to
posit
the
following.
the
tobacco
company's
principal
submission
is
that
their
product,
contrary
to
the
testimony
they
gave
a
few
years
ago,
is
so
dangerous,
that
if
the
fda
has
to
regulate
it...
and
they
concede
that
there
is
nothing
in...
in
the
statute
or
in
any
of
these
later
specific
statutes
that
either
precludes
or
preempts
the
fda
from
exercising
the
authority
that
it
has,
but
it
is
now
so
dangerous
that
if
the
fda
regulates,
it
will
have
to
ban,
and
that
is
a
ridiculous
public
health
result
that
congress
never
could
have
intended.
now,
first
of
all,
the
fda
has
construed
and
it
is
in
the
rulemaking...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
what...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
it
is...
it...
there
are...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
the
fda
regulates
alcohol
in
every
respect
except
in
which
it
appears
as
a
food.
i...
i
won't
characterize.
i'll
let...
mr.
cooper
can
characterize
his
own
argument
very
ably,
but
the
question
that
the
fda
put
is
in
light
of
all
of
this
evidence
and
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
definitions
and
the...
the
striking
similarity
and
the
characteristics
of
this...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
and...
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
justice
souter,
when...
when
one
is
talking
about
a
drug
or
a
device
that
delivers
a
drug
to
the
body,
like
a
cigarette
or
a
syringe,
there
is
no
problem
applying
the
literal
meaning,
but
in
any
event,
the
fda
went
way
beyond
applying
a
literal
meaning
and
looked
at
great
length
to
the
extent
to
which
these
devices...
and
their
intended
effects
resembled
things
over
which
they
already
regulated.
but
my
point
is
if
they
are
right,
if
these
products,
because
they
are
dangerous,
must
be
banned,
and
the
fda
cannot
work
with
congress
to...
to
accomplish
an
amendment
to
the
statute
that
would,
like
so
many
other
product-specific
amendments,
like
saccharine,
that
have
been
enacted
to
enable
the
fda
to
continue
to
regulate
in
accordance
with
its
public
health
mandate,
then
two
things
will
happen.
one,
we
will
have
an
inability
of
this
agency
with
the
pragmatic
responsibility
to,
for
example,
require
them
to
use
a
filter
or
add
a
substance
that
would
make
these
things
less
causing...
less
able
to
cause
cancer
or
less
addictive,
and,
number
two,
we
would
have
them
remain
as
if
not
the
only...
virtually
the
only
finished
product
that
is
ingested
in
the
body
that
is
regulated
and
inspected
by
no
federal
agency
and
yet
is
so
dangerous.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
lawless.
the
agency
has
made
a
reasoned
determination
about
a
statute
that
this
court
has
always
given
it
great
deference
to,
and
this...
which
this
court
has
uniformly
said
must
be
given
a
broad
reading
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
it
has
found
without
dispute
that
pharmacological
effects
are
produced,
they
are
intended,
and
that
the
manufacturers
secretly
for
years
have
engineered
their
products
to
sustain
those
particular
uses.
the...
the
notion
that
this
somehow
exceeds
the
bounds
of
the
law,
i
suppose,
depends
on
either
a
notion
that
although
this
statute
is
careful
in
different
sections
to
talk
about
intended
use
versus
claims...
and
we've
cited
many
of
the
instances
in
our...
in
our
brief...
nonetheless,
intended
use
has
to
be
meant
to
read...
to
read
claim.
that...
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
fdca
to
have
intended
use
mean
market
claims
would
revolutionalize
the
way
this
agency
has
done
business
for
more
than
60
years,
and
it
would
create
the
largest
regulatory
hole
in
existence
by
allowing
anyone,
no
matter
how
dangerous
or
benign
their
product,
to
market
it
simply
by
saying
that
it
provides
satisfaction,
or
it's
ibuprofen,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
what
it...
what
it
regulates.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief
at
page
5
and
with
specific
reference
to
the
aspirin
example,
which
is
the
only
example
that
they've
given,
the
fda
does
not
regulate
off-label
use
by...
may
i
finish
my
answer?
does
not
regulate
off-label
use
by
physicians,
but
it
provides...
and
there
is
a
1972
notice
that
was
published
in
the
federal
register
that
when
it
determines
that
an
off-label
use
becomes
widespread
or
common,
it
will
inquire,
ask
the
manufacturer
to
come
in
and
may
require
it
to
label
it,
which
it
has
done
with
respect
to
baby
aspirin
itself.
mr.
gen
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you
very
much.
