anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
second?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when...
when...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
in
your...
when
in
your
view,
what
year,
what
time,
could
the
agency
reasonably
have
regulated
cigarettes
as
a
drug?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
interpreted
your
remarks
as
saying
it
would
not
have...
i
think
i
heard
you
right
that
it
could
not
reasonably
have
regulated
tobacco
as
a
drug
in
1938.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but...
but...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
if
the
requisite
intent
as
hypothesized
by
justice
stevens
were
found,
that
fda
could
regulate
despite
the
existence
of
the
congressional
statutes
that
have
been
enacted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
statutory
argument
stands
on
its
own?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
we
got...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
were
just
referring...
you
were
just
referring...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
as
a
preface
to
this
same
subject,
i...
i
had
the
same
concerns
with
the
case,
and
they
were
addressed
by
justice
souter
when
he
asked
about
the
global
position
of
the
case
with
reference
to
the
statute,
and
i
wasn't
quite
sure
that
the
solicitor
general
was
able
to...
to
focus
in
on
it
either.
as
part
of
your
discussion,
perhaps
you
could
tell
me...
tell
us,
section
1331,
does
this
repeal
the...
the
original
fda
in
part
and...
or...
or
is
it
an
indication
that
congress
is
now
taking
away
jurisdiction
that
once
the
fda
would
have
had?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
read
1331
as
saying...
as
being
a
congressional
determination
that
tobacco
is
a
lawful
product?
