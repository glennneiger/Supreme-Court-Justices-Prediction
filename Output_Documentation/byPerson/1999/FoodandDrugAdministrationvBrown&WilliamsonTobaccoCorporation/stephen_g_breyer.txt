justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
basically
what
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yeah,
but...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but,
again,
if...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
could
have...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
couldn't
you
have
aspirin?
everybody
knows
what
it
does
and
you
don't
need
a
claim.
all
you
have
to
say
is
the
word.
verybody
knows
what
it
does,
and
would
you
say
there
is
no
intent
there
to
cure
headaches?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
isn't
claim
evidentiary
of
intent...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather
than
the
other
way
around?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
a
claim
establishes
objective
intent,
hear
what
they
have
now,
but
not
previously,
is
every
smoker,
no
longer
being
able
to
kid
themselves...
knows
that
this
nicotine
through
chemical
effect,
metabolized
in
the
body,
creates
feelings
of
tranquility
and
calmness
and
satisfies
a
craving
created
by
chemical
addiction.
they
know
it,
the
smokers.
the
manufacturers
know
it,
and
nobody
can
kid
themselves
anymore,
though
maybe
they
could
have
kidded
themselves
before
1965.
now,
i
take
it
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
fda
says
this
falls
right
within
the
language,
the
purpose,
the
precedence,
and
everything
else
in
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure
there
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure
there
is.
what
there
is,
is
there's
risk.
that
is
to
say,
is
the
wordin
this
statute
supposed
to
stop
the
fda
from
looking
at
the
real
world?
what
they
say
is
that
overall
we
get
more
safety
by
letting
people
smoke
for
a
while
because
of
the
addiction
in
the
country,
the
risk
of
black
market.
in
other
words,
suppose
aspirin
turned
out
to
have
a
chemical
that
was
very
harmful,
but
it
was
also
addictive.
if
they
discovered
that
for
the
first
time,
wouldn't
they
have
the
power
to
treat
these
other
sections
of
the
statute,
looking
to
safety
overall
for
the
public
rather
than
suddenly
withdrawing
an
additive
substance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
an
individual,
but,
i
mean,
can't
they
have
a
remedy
that
creates
safety
overall
rather
than
a
remedy
that
will
in
fact
lead
to
a
lot
of
people
being
hurt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
i
thought
methadone...
i
thought...
sorry...
cocaine
and
these
drugs
are
the
controlled
substances
act,
a
different
act.
i
also
thought
that
methadone
in
fact
does
involve
such
a
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
one
other
question
which
is...
i
mean,
i
seem...
to
me,
underlying
your
basic
food
and
cosmetic
argument...
food...
the...
that
act,
there
were
two
really
basic
points,
and
one
you've
dealt
with,
which
is
the
question
of,
well,
what
remedy.
it
doesn't
foresee
a
sense
of
a
remedy,
and
that's
a
question
of
flexibility.
and
the
other
thing
is
what
i
thought
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier,
which
is
it
will
produce
a
whole
lot
of
bizarre
results
such
as,
if
you
could
regulate
tobacco,
then
they
could
regulate
thermal
gloves.
have
i
focussed
you
on
what
i'm
thinking
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
in
thinking
about
that,
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
suppose
you
got
the
thermal-glove
effect,
you
know,
warm
hands,
through
a
pill.
you
know,
somebody
said
take
this
pill,
it
will
toughen
your
skin
and
bring
gloves...
bring
blood
to
your
hand.
well,
now
we're
taking
it
through
a
pill
and
now
it's
going
to
affect
our
metabolism
and
change
the
chemistry
of
the
brain
or
something.
well,
is
it
absurd
that
the
fda
could
regulate
that
kind
of
stuff
if
you
got
it
through
a
pill?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
when
is
the
claim
part?
and
i
think
we've
dealt
with
that.
leave
the...
i
mean,
not
that
you've...
i'm
saying,
let's
put
that
to
the
side
for
a
minute
and
come
back
to
it
if
you'd
like,
but
is
there
anything
other
than
the
claim?
you
know,
what
they
do
is
they
say
take
this
pill,
it's
metabolized,
it
affects
your
brain,
creates
an
addiction,
and
lo
and
behold,
you've
got
warm
hands
if
it
gets
cold
in
the
winter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah...
or
no.
well,
it's...
yeah,
maybe
it
is,
and
so
could
they
regulate
that
if
it's
not
a
food?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
could
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why...
why
not
in
terms
of
the
words
of
the
act,
the
purpose
of
the
act,
the
limitation
which
has
gotten...
see,
i
got
the
limitation
by
working
backwards
from
the
device
statute.
do
you
see
what
i
mean
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
if
the
device
is
not,
well,
this
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
does
it
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
marmola?
i
mean,
why...
why
would
a
pill
that
keeps
your
hands
warm
be
different
from
a
pill
that
makes
you
look
slim
and
trim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or...
but
is
then
that...
is
it
only
the
claim
that
makes
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
only
the
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
if
it's
only...
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
good
enough
to
say
the
claim...
the
claim,
in
our
case
of
the
hand-warmers,
it
keeps
your
hand
warm
with
marmola,
it
keeps
you
thin,
and
with
cigarettes,
what
it
does
is
it
makes
you
feel
tranquil,
stimulated,
and
cures
a
physical
craving
that
it
created
through
addiction.
that's
the
claim,
okay?
now,
under
those
circumstances,
aren't
those
three
things
the
same?
then
we
can
get
to
whether
there
is
a
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
leave
the
claim
out
of
it
for
the
moment.
i'll...
have
we
got
three
similar
cases?
marmola,
the
hand-warming
pill,
and
let's
call
it
the
cigarette.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
of
which
you're
saying
in
the
one
case,
we
keep
your
hands
warm,
in
the
second
case,
we
keep
you
slim
and
trim,
and
in
the
third
case,
we
keep
you
tranquil,
stimulated,
and
we
cure
an
addiction,
i.e.,
we
satisfy
an
addictive
craving
that
we
ourselves
created.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
that's
so
and
all
we're
left
with
is
a...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
got
all
that
out.
all...
if
all
we've
got
left
is
the
claim,
now,
why
isn't
it
the
same
as
making
a
claim
that
everybody
who
buys
the
product
knows
that
you
want
it
to
do
that
and
you
do
want
it
to
do
that,
and
so
they
don't
have
to
read
words
on
a
package,
they've
got
the
point
once
you
say
it's
a
cigarette?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
it's
a
default
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
text.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
then
the...
primary
purpose
would
serve
the
same
thing.
it's
the
primary
purpose
of
the
cigarette
manufacturer
to
produce
this
satisfaction
or
tranquility
or
stimulation
through
an
addictive
mechanism.
it
is
not
the
primary
purpose
of
the
drug
manufacturer
to
produce
the
off-label
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
well,
if
it
is,
then
why...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
shouldn't
they
go...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
through
the
process?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
not
the
end
of
the
world
if
they
can
regulate
children's
aspirin.
i
mean...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
should.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
thought
the
claim,
of
course,
is
always
present
with
almost
all
drugs
because
drugs
normally
by
their
name
don't
explain
themselves,
but
the
unusual
thing
here
is
that
we
do
have
a
product
that
everybody
knows
what
it
does,
and
that's
why
i
ask
whether
claim
isn't
really
indicative
of
intent
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
why
do
you
need
the
wordwhich
isn't
in
the
statute...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
in
fact
you
have
the
product
that
the
manufacturer
wants
it
used
for
x
and
everybody
knows
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
the...
the
way
around
that...
the
way
around
that
was
primary
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
would
avoid
the
problem
that
you
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
justice
o’connor
said,
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
dissent.
the
act
that
we
are
interpreting
says
that
drugs
include
"articles
other
than
food
intended
to
affect
the
structure
or
any
function
of
the
body."
that
language
applies
to
chemicals
that
affect
the
body
after
being
metabolized
and
it
therefore
applies
to
the
chemical
nicotine
in
cigarettes,
which
physically
changes
the
brain
and
consequently
stabilizes
mood,
suppresses
apatite,
and
satisfies
an
addictive
craving
that
the
nicotine
itself
has
created.
cigarette
manufacturers
intend
both
means
and
ends.
an
intent
revealed
many
years
ago
by
express
advertisements
and
which
is
reveal
today
by
internal
memoranda
stating
for
example
“think
of
the
cigarette
as
a
dispenser
for
a
dose
unit
of
nicotine.”
this
court
has
previously
said
that
the
acts’
words
weren’t
“a
liberal
construction
consistent
with
the
acts’
overwriting
purpose."
that
purpose,
protecting
the
public
health,
strongly
supports
our
dissenting
conclusion.
for
as
justice
o’connor
pointed
out,
tobacco
products
cause
more
deaths
each
year
than
aids,
car
accidents,
alcohol,
homicides,
illegal
drugs,
suicides
and
fires
combined.
the
history
of
this
1938
new
deal
act
offers
further
support.
the
majority
believes
that
the
statute
does
not
fit
cigarettes
because
it
requires
the
fda
to
ban
a
dangerous
product.
well
the
fda
itself
believes
that
a
ban
is
inappropriate
for
cigarettes.
that
argument
suggests
limits
upon
fda’s
remedial
discretion
not
upon
its
jurisdiction,
but
even
if
we
are
wrong
about
that
we
do
not
think
that
the
act
requires
a
ban.
imagine
an
addictive
sleeping
pill,
which
turned
out
to
be
dangerous
and
not
very
effective.
the
fda
might
decide
against
an
immediate
ban
for
fear
of
dangerous
black-market
substitutes
choosing
instead
lesser
remedies
that
would
promote
a
gradual
withdraw.
why
would
congress
want
to
force
the
fda
to
choose
a
more
dangerous
remedy?
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
require
that
reverse
result,
the
majority
also
points
to
other
statutes
enacted
more
recently
against
the
legislative
background
in
which
the
fda
itself
denied
it
had
jurisdiction.
those
denials
at
most
may
have
created
a
legislative
atmosphere
in
which
many
members
of
congress
did
assume
that
the
fda
would
not
take
jurisdiction,
but
a
legislative
atmosphere
is
not
a
law
unless
it
is
embodied
in
statutory
words
and
phrases.
the
statutory
words
and
phrases
that
are
here
at
issue
are
silent,
they
do
not
reveal
an
intent
to
prevent
the
fda
ever
from
exercising
jurisdiction;
they
simply
leave
the
matter
untouched
where
they
found
it.
according
to
the
fda
only
2.5%
of
all
smokers
successfully
stop
smoking
each
year,
even
though
70%
say
they
want
to
quit
and
34%
actually
make
an
effort.
that
fact
helps
illustrate
a
certain
hard
reality
that
nicotine
in
cigarettes
creates
a
powerful
physiological
addiction,
flowing
from
chemically
induced
changes
in
the
brain.
that
reality,
the
fda’s
finding
of
intent,
the
statute's
language,
the
statute's
purpose,
and
the
statute's
history
are
sufficient
to
show
regulatory
jurisdiction.
the
majority
today
holds
that
a
regulatory
statute
aimed
at
unsafe
drugs
and
devices
does
not
authorize
regulation
of
a
drug
nicotine
and
a
device
a
cigarette
that
the
majority
itself
finds
unsafe.
far
more
than
most,
this
particular
drug
and
device,
risks
the
life-threatening
harms
that
administrative
regulation
seeks
to
rectify.
the
majority’s
conclusion
is
counter-intuitive
and
we
believe,
in
dissent,
that
the
law
does
not
require
that
result.
that
is
why
we
dissent.
