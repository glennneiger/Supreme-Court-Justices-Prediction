sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
something
slightly
different
than
that,
of
course.
it's
not
a
remote
hypothetical
possibility
at
all,
but
rather
an
expected
entry
of
a
judgment,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
is
that
a
ministerial
act,
or...
or
what
was
to
take
place
here?
is
it
a...
something
that
might
well
not
have
occurred--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
entry
of
the
judgment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
defense
counsel
did
tell
and
argue
to
the
jury--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
he
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
this
person
would
never,
as
a
practical
matter,
get
out,
if
he
lived
to
be
120?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
justice
scalia
has
raised
a
question
which
i
think
is
one
that
should
be
of
concern,
and
that
is,
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
where
is
the
line
drawn?
and
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
in
substance
it
was,
in
effect,
just
a
ministerial
act
that
remained
and
therefore
this
man
was
parole
ineligible,
what
about
the
next
case
where,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
defendant
wouldn't
be
parole
eligible
for
80
years?
must
that
be
given
also
to
the
jury
in
an
appropriate
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
would
concede--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
that
kind
of
hypothetical--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
ruled
out
by
simmons--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
to
do
that
would
require
an
extension.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
that
you
fall
within
simmons,
properly
understood,
without
extending
it
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
for
example,
suppose
the
judge
on
the
third
case
here
had
taken
the
order
form
home
in
order
to
sign
it.
he's
overworked
and
had
a
lot
to
do,
and
he
takes
a
lot
of
homework
home.
he
signed
it
but
failed
to
get
it
back
to
the
clerk
or
got
it
back
to
his
clerk
2
days
later,
and
so
it
wasn't
formally
entered
in
the
docket
by
the
clerk,
by
the
stamp
until
after
ramdass
had
been
sentenced.
now,
covered
by
simmons
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
entry
of
the
judgment
may
have
been
a
purely
ministerial
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
not...
it
was
not
in
any
way
a
situation
where
it
wouldn't
be
entered
in
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--tell
us
why.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sua
sponte...
sua
sponte
the
judge
can
do
that?
