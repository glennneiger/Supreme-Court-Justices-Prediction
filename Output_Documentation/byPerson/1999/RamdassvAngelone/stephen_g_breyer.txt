justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
if
it's
subject
to
appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
we
have
mr.
simmons
back,
and
mr.
simmons
says,
you
know,
there's
something
you
didn't
know
about,
although
i've
been
convicted
and
the
conviction
had
been
entered,
it
could
have
been
reversed
on
appeal.
he
doesn't
say
that.
the
state
says
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
does
he
get...
we're
going
to
execute
him
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
all
right,
fine.
let's
suppose
the
state
said
the
following.
in
our
state...
and
here...
here's
how
it
goes.
right?
the
prosecutor
says,
this
is
a
very
dangerous
person.
you
better
execute
him.
the
defendant
says,
judge,
i
would
like
to
tell
the
jury
that
i
happen
to
be
in
jail
forever.
i
can't
get
out
on
parole.
and
the
rule
is...
the
rule
is
he
has
a
right
to
tell
him
that
if,
under
state
law,
he's
ineligible
for
parole.
all
right?
well,
why
isn't
he
ineligible
for
parole?
you
say,
well,
because
although
the
jury
had
convicted
him,
the
judge
hadn't
yet
done
the
ministerial
thing
of
putting
the
order
down.
well,
i
say
all
the
time
people
convict
somebody.
they
may
be
ineligible
for
parole.
maybe
there
would
be
an
appeal.
maybe
he
would
be
reversed
on
appeal.
maybe
they'd
be...
maybe
they
would
decide
the
prisons
were
overcrowded,
let
them
all
out.
maybe
they
would
decide...
maybe
there
would
be
a
war
and
everybody
would
get
an
amnesty.
now...
now,
suppose
a
state
said,
by
the
way,
in
our
state
we
consider
a
person
ineligible
for
parole
only
when
it's
really
definite,
only
when
we
can
be
really
certain
that
they
won't
be
reversed
on
appeal,
that
there
won't
be
a
general
amnesty
given
by
the
governor,
that
there
will
not
be
a
declaration
of
war,
and
so
we
have
to
get
everybody
out
to
fight
in
the
armed
services.
in
our
state,
we
consider
all
those
things
have
to
happen.
should
a
federal
court
say,
oh,
that's
very
different
from
simmons?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
your...
on
your
view
of
it...
you
know,
what
we're
imagining
is
ridiculous
possibilities.
in
fact,
the
possibility
of
reversal
on
appeal
is
a
lot
less
ridiculous
than
the
possibility
that
this
judge
wouldn't
enter
the
order.
but
what
we're
considering
are
fairly
ridiculous
possibilities,
and
a
state
court
that
happens
to
announce
under
our
state
law
a
person
is
really
ineligible
for
parole
only
when
all
those
ridiculous
possibilities
are
negative.
i'm
saying
i
think...
and
your
view
is
if
the
state
court
says
that,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
a
different
question.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
but
what
i'm
doing
is
i'm
not
being
clear
myself.
you
see,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
argument
is.
is
your
argument
that
if
a
state
court
were
to
say,
in
our
state
you're
not...
the
law
is
identical
to
what
it
is
in
virginia
but
for
one
thing.
the
state
court
announces,
we
consider
you
ineligible
for
parole
only
when
all
appeals
have
been
terminated.
we
consider
you
ineligible
for
parole
only
when
the
governor
announces
he's
not
going
to
give
you
a
pardon,
et
cetera.
what's
your
view
of
how
that
works?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
in
your...
in
your
view,
if
the
state
court
were
to
say,
we
consider
our
people
ineligible
for
parole
only
when
the
governor
announces
he's
not
going
to
give
a
pardon.
in
your
view,
that
person
would
not
qualify
for
the
instruction
under
simmons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i...
if
i
believe
that
you
were
wrong
about
that,
would
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
believed
that
simmons...
that
would
be
so
far
from
what
simmons
intended,
that...
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
see
why...
why
exactly.
i
mean,
the...
the
argument
on
the...
i
think
would
be
that...
that
simmons
says
when
a
person
is
ineligible
for
parole--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
a
matter
of
state
law,
you
must
tell
the
jury,
let
him
tell
the
jury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
this
person
is.
he
simply
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
now,
but
they're
not
deciding
the
federal
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean...
and
simmons
itself...
see,
it's
a
federal
question
whether
he...
and...
and
they're
not
deciding
that
federal
question.
and
simmons
itself
understands
that
there
is
some
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
person
really
will
get
out.
the
conviction
could
be
reversed
on
parole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there's
no
difference
between
that
kind
of
uncertainty,
like
reversal
on
parole,
and
the
kind
of
uncertainty
that
consists
of
whether
the
judge
will
perform
a
ministerial
act.
now,
that's...
that's...
i'm
recasting
it
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
to
get
your
response
to
the
recasting
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
there...
why...
why
would
you?
suppose
you
simply
said
where
they're
ineligible
and
they
are
ineligible
where
there
has
been
an
authoritative
determination
that
they
are
guilty
of
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clear,
bright
line,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
could
say
that
there
has
not
been
an
authoritative
determination
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime
that...
that
led
to
no
parole.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
wouldn't
that
be
implicit
in
simmons?
i
mean,
the
issue
didn't
come
up
in
simmons
as
to...
i
agree
with
you.
it
didn't
come
up
because
everyone
knew
that
he
was
ineligible,
but
if
you
were
to
ask
a
lawyer
what
does
it
mean,
they'd
say,
well,
where
there
has
been
an
authoritative
determination,
nobody
would
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
decide
an
appeal
that
wasn't
gotten
there.
everybody
would
think
there
has
to
be
some
judicial
determination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
that
i
grant--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
absolutely
not
decided
in
simmons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
question
of
the
authoritative--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--surely
you're
not
eligible
for
parole
if
you
haven't
been
convicted.
i
mean,
if
the
judge
is
going
to
set
aside
the
jury's
conviction,
you're
not
eligible
for
parole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
parole
doesn't
enter
into
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course,
that's
true.
i
mean,
you're
absolutely
right
that
it's
dependent
on
what
state
law
is.
but
is
it
dependent
upon
what
the
state
law
decides
the
federal
question
to
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
here
was
the
virginia
court
doing
anything
other
than
deciding
the
federal
question
of
whether,
for
purposes
of
simmons,
he
is
eligible
or
ineligible
for
parole?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
do
we
have
to
listen
to
a
state
court's
determination
of
that
federal
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the...
the...
this
is
very
unusual.
it's
very
complicated
and
philosophical
in
a
sense.
it's
an
unusual
case
where
the
legal
situation
in...
in
virginia
is
totally
clear.
there's
no
disagreement
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
only
thing
that
happens
in
that
absolutely
agreed
upon
legal
situation
is
a
virginia
court
says,
we
are
going
to
use
these
words,
ineligible
for
parole,
to
apply
to
this
situation
simply
because
the
judge
hasn't
yet
come
in
yet.
now,
i'd
say
that's
the
federal
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
federal
question,
about
whether
you
should
use
those
words
ineligible
for
parole
in
respect
to
simmons
on
this
absolutely
agreed
upon
legal
circumstance
in
virginia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
we
could
easily
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
could
say
is,
the
matter
of
federal
law
which
is
clear
from
simmons
is
the
following.
where
there
has
been
authoritative
determination
by
the
state
that
the
person
is
ineligible
for
parole,
or
convicted
of
the
third
crime
that
makes
him
ineligible,
that's
when
simmons
cuts
in.
now,
i
think
maybe
that's
implicit
in
simmons
and...
and
you
would
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
it
isn't.
but
one
thing
i
would
be
certain
is
i
don't
think
that
the
state
court's
answer
to
that
question
would
get
deference
from
a
federal
court.
