justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bruck,
in
this
case
you
say,
you
know,
it's
pretty
clear
that
it
would
have...
in
the
next
case
it
won't
be
quite
so
clear
that...
you
know,
that...
that
he
will
get
the
third...
the
third
strike
which
will
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
paroled.
and
the
next
case
will
be
a
little
less
clear
than
that.
frankly,
i...
i
don't
know
where
to
stop,
short
of
the
bright
line
that's
urged
by
your
opponents
in
this
case,
which
is
at
the
time
the
sentence
in
this
case
was
pronounced,
could
you
say
it
was
the
state
law
that
this
person
could
not
be
paroled?
and
you
could
not
say
it
at
the
time
that
this...
that
this
jury
was
sitting.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
answer
was...
was
no,
he
would
not
be
ineligible
for
parole.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
ultimately
have
to
come
back
to
that.
you
ultimately
have
to
come
back
to
showing
that
that
was
not
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
simmons...
it's
not
a
matter
of
law.
it's
just,
you
know,
what
are
the
odds--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if...
if
it's
really
a
thousand
to
one
even
though
there's
a...
you
know,
a
small
possibility
under
state
law?
is
that
simmons
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
be
absolute
impossibility
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
so,
it's
not
absolute.
it's...
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
whether
under
current...
whether
under
current
virginia
law
he
will
be
ever
eligible
for
parole
can
be
absolutely
answered
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
just
says
that
the
court
can't
make
the
decision.
it
doesn't
say
what
the
decision
had
to
be.
the
decision
by
the
parole
board
had
to
be
that
he
is
ineligible.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
is
there
he
was
in
the
rule.
all
of
the
factors
that
had
to
occur
before
the
parole
board
decided
the
case
had
occurred,
and
here
something
has
not
occurred
which
is
essential
to
the
judgment
that
you're
not
parolable,
namely
that
you've
been
convicted
three
times.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
hadn't
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
the
determination.
sure,
the
determination
hadn't
been
made,
but
all
of
the
factors
that
bear
upon
that
determination
had
occurred.
and
here
all
of
the
factors
that...
that
bear
upon
the
determination
you
want
made
had
not
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he's
only
been
indicted
for
the
third
crime,
but
the...
the
evidence
is
overwhelming?
justice
antonin
scalia
simmons...
why
not?
i
mean,
chances
are
virtually
certain
he's
going
to
be
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
simmons
would
apply
if
he
had
already
confessed
to
that
third
crime
even
though
he
hasn't
yet...
what
if
he
has
confessed
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
has
confessed
to
the
third
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
i
mean,
as
you
say,
if
he's
confessed,
he's
going
to
be
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
and
i
don't
want
to
go
nuts
trying
to
figure
out
how
far
down
the
line
we're...
we're
going
to
carry
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
never
mind
even
state
law.
even
if
we
were
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
federal
law
looking
at
virginia,
if
the
conviction
were
overturned
on
appeal,
i
assume
what
would
happen
is
that
the
prior
ineligibility
for
parole,
which
existed
upon
the
conviction,
would
be
eliminated.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wouldn't
retroactively
mean
that
he
was
not
ineligible
for
parole.
he
is
ineligible
in
virginia
from
the
time
of
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
should
it
be
reversed
later,
he
would
then
be...
he
would
then
be
eligible.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
would
have
been
ineligible
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we're
going
to
say
that
it's
our
decision,
a
federal
decision,
whether
he's
eligible
under...
whether
he's
eligible
for
parole,
it
would
be
a
very
strange
way
to
describe
it
as
saying
it
depends
on
whether
he's
eligible
for
parole
under
virginia
law
or
under
south
carolina
law.
it
seems
to
me
meaningless
to
say...
to
say
that
we're
going
to
refer
to
south
carolina
law,
but
the
answer
that
south
carolina
gives
is
not
necessarily
the
right
answer.
i
really
don't
understand
how
that
argument
goes.
do
you
understand
how
that
argument
goes?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
virginia
law,
but
it
really
doesn't
depend
on
virginia
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
could
have
said
in
simmons
that
the
question
is
whether
he
is
likely
to
be
paroled
by...
by
south
carolina
or...
or
very
likely
to
be
paroled
by
virginia.
justice
antonin
scalia
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
say
that.
we
said
whether
he
is
eligible
for
parole
under
south
carolina--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
virginia
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
should
reformulate
simmons
then
and
say,
you
know,
that
issue
is
whether
he
is
likely
or
overwhelmingly
likely
or
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
will
be
paroled
by
virginia.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
would
solve
the
problem
that
you're
worried
about.
but
unfortunately,
that
isn't
what
we
said
in
simmons.
