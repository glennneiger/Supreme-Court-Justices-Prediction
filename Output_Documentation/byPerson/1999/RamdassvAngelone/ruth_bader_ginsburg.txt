justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
go
back
to
with
the...
the
question...
one
of
the
things
i
believe
that
i
said
in
simmons,
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
the
judge,
if
the
lawyer
can
bring
it
out.
and
here
the
lawyer
told
the
jury.
but
we
know
that
the
jury
had
a
question
on
that
question.
they
were
deliberating
for
what?
3
hours?
and
they
came
out
and
said,
if
defendant
is
given
life,
is
there
a
possibility
of
parole
at
some
time
before
his
natural
death?
and
that's
the
question
that
the
lawyer
had
wanted
to
answer
before,
and...
but
he
couldn't
under
virginia
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
so,
he
couldn't
do
what
simmons
said
a
lawyer
could
do
and
then
the
judge
doesn't
need
to
do
it.
virginia
law
prohibited
the
lawyer
from
doing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i...
this
is
a
jury
that's
not
composed
of
lawyers.
their
question
was...
didn't
say
is
this
person
eligible
for
control.
they
asked
is
there
a
possibility
of
parole
at
some
time
before
his
natural
death.
they
were
asking
is
there
any
chance
he's
going
to
get
out.

justice
ruth
bader

mr.
bruck,
what
about
the
answer
is...
you're
asking
us
to
draw
the
line
where
in...
in
practical
reality
we
know
that
this
person
is
going
to
get
judgment
entered
on
the
conviction.
but
suppose
it's
just
that
somebody
has
pled
guilty
to
a
qualifying...
a
crime
that
would
qualify
for
a
strike,
hasn't
yet
been
sentenced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
simmons
there
was
the...
the
adjudication.
i'm...
i'm
taking
this
case
one
step
back
from
where
we
are
in
the
domino
pizza
case.
so,
the...
the...
it's
not
just
that
the...
that
all
post-trial
motions
have
been
made
and
that
nothing...
nothing
was
wanting
except
the
judge's
signature
on
the
judgment.
but
there's
just
been
a
guilty
plea.
there's
been
no
sentencing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
judge
had
turned
down
all
post-trial
motions--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
the
equivalent
of
a...
whatever
they
call
it
these
days...
a
directed
verdict,
nov?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
legal
rulings
at
the
trial
itself--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--those
all
would
have
had
to
have
been
made,
wouldn't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
he
had
made...
didn't
he
make
a
motion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
he
make
a
motion
post-verdict?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i'm
talking
about
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
