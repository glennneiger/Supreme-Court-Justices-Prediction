not

justice
anthony
m.

bobby
lee
ramdass
was
convicted
in
virginia
state
courts,
of
murder
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
he
is
the
petitioner
in
this
court
and
contends
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
sentencing
trial.
the
opinion
announcing
the
judgment,
there
are
four
justices
including
myself,
who
subscribed
the
opinion
i
have
written.
in
1992,
petitioner
was
released
on
parole
and
almost
immediately
embarked
on
a
series
of
violent
crimes.
in
a
period
of
just
over
two
months
he
murdered
two
people,
shot
another
in
the
head
and
left
him
bleeding
from
a
serious
wound
and
assaulted
yet
another
person
with
a
deadly
weapon.
he
also
committed
a
series
of
armed
robberies.
this
proceeding
involves
his
conviction
for
the
capital
murder
of
mohammad
kayani,
who
is
the
last
person
he
killed.
kayani
was
a
clerk
at
a
convenience
store,
robbed
by
the
petitioner
and
his
accomplices,
when
kayani
fumbled
in
an
attempt
to
open
the
store
safe,
the
petitioner
held
a
gun
to
kayani’s
head
and
pulled
the
trigger,
the
gun
did
not
fire,
on
a
second
attempt
the
gun
discharged
killing
kayani.
petitioner
stood
over
the
body
and
laughed,
and
after
the
robbery
he
asked
his
accomplices,
“why
the
other
customers
were
not
also
killed?”
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
the
petitioner
had
been
tried
for
two
of
his
earlier
crimes.
first,
a
final
judgment
of
conviction
had
been
entered
for
petitioner’s
robbery
at
the
pizza
hut
restaurant.
second,
a
jury
had
returned
a
guilty
verdict
for
the
robbery
of
the
domino's
pizza
restaurant,
but
no
final
judgment
of
conviction
had
yet
been
imposed.
after
the
jury
found
petitioner
guilty
of
murdering
kayani
the
capital
sentencing
proceeding
was
conducted.
during
deliberations,
the
jury
asked
the
judge
whether
the
petitioner
could
be
paroled
before
his
death.
in
accordance
with
then
existing
virginia
law,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
were
not
to
concern
themselves
with
matters
that
would
occur
after
the
sentence
was
imposed.
the
jury
then
returned
with
its
verdict
and
recommended
the
sentence
of
death.
after
that
trial
we
decided
simmons
versus
south
carolina.
simmons
held
that
under
certain
narrow
circumstances,
a
capital
defendant
is
entitled
to
inform
the
jury
that
he
would
be
ineligible
for
parole
if
he
were
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
we
have
not
extended
simmons
in
subsequent
cases;
the
this
positive
effect
in
simmons
was
that
the
defendant
had
conclusively
established
his
parole
ineligibility
under
state
law,
at
the
time
of
the
jury
deliberations
and
of
the
murder
trial.
in
this
case,
in
contrast
to
simmons,
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
declared
that
the
three-strikes
law
did
not
apply
and
therefore
the
petitioner
was
not
paroled
ineligible
under
state
law,
at
the
time
of
his
murder
trial
because
no
judgment
of
conviction
had
been
entered
for
the
domino's
crime.
especially
in
light
of
the
possibility
the
petitioner’s
prior
convictions
could
have
been
overturned
by
the
trial
court
or
on
appeal.
this
difference
between
simmons
and
this
case
forecloses
us
from
granting
the
relief
petitioner
requests;
the
rule
of
simmons
does
not
apply.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
join.
