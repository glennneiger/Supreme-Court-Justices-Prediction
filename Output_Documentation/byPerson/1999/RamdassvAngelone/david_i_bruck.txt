mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
simmons
v.
south
carolina,
this
court
held
that
a
capital
defendant
may
rebut
the
state's
allegation
of
future
dangerousness
by
showing,
if
it
is
so,
that
he
could
never
be
paroled
from
prison
on
a
life
sentence
if
the
jury
gave
him
a
life
sentence.
immediately
after
deciding
simmons,
this
court
reversed
this
case
and
remanded
it
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
simmons.
the
issue
now
presented
is
whether
the
virginia
supreme
court
erred
when
it
effectively
engrafted
onto
this
court's
holding
in
simmons
an
additional
requirement
that,
in
order
to
come
within
the
ambit
of
simmons,
a
defendant
must
not
only
have
no
possibility
under
state
law
of
being
released
on
parole
throughout
his
entire
lifetime,
but
also
that
that
ineligibility
have
been
formally
declared
on
the
day
of
his
capital
sentence.
now--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
but
it...
it
looked
at...
it
implicitly
looked
at
all
of
state
law
and
not--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--parole
eligibility
under
simmons
means
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
parole
absent...
and
the
court
looked
at
remote...
what
it
described...
the
plurality
described
as
hypothetical
possibilities,
some
of
which
would
have--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
but
the
concurrence
necessarily
had
to
accept...
in
order
to
reach
the
same
result,
had
to
accept
the
plurality's
characterization
of
parole
ineligibility
as
not
including
remote
hypothetical
possibilities.
and
it
listed
such
things
as
commutation,
which
can
lead
to
parole
eligibility
and
release
on
parole,
clemency
which
can
have
the
same,
and
also
a
change
of
law.
in
other
words,
it
looked
to
state
law--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--the
plurality
made
this
explicit,
but
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
o'connor,
which
created
the
majority
in
simmons,
could
not
have
taken
any
other
view
because
if
that
was
correct,
then
it
would
not
be...
if...
if
the
plurality
opinion
as
to
what
constituted
ineligibility
was
not
the
view
of
the
court,
then
simmons...
the
holding
of
simmons
as
expressed
by
the
concurring
opinion
could
not
have
been
handed
down
because
it
would
not
be
possible
to
say,
given
these
remote
hypothetical
possibilities
in
the
future,
that
mr.
simmons
himself
was
truly
ineligible
for
parole.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
but
it
is--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
whether
we
call
it
ministerial
or
whether
we
simply
acknowledge
that
it
was
inexorable
really
makes
no
difference.
it
was
going
to
happen.
the
jury's
verdict
on
this,
what
would
have
been
the
last
strike,
had
been
handed
down.
he
had
been
found
guilty.
all
motions
to...
to
strike
the
evidence,
that
is,
for
directed
verdict,
judgment
nov,
in
effect,
had
been
already
denied
and,
under
virginia
law,
could
not
be
renewed.
the
sentencing
was
19
days
away.
now,
the...
interestingly,
the
state
has
never,
until
its
brief
in
this
court,
ever
identified
something,
anything,
that
might
have
happened
in
reality
to...
to
block
the
entry
of
that
judgment
and
thus--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
he
did.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
but
virginia
law
prohibited
him
from
giving
the
most
important
aspect
of
that,
which
was
that
these
long
terms
of
years
could
not
be
reduced
by
parole,
and
the
jury
spotted
the
omission.
and
we
know
that.
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
that
because
they
came
out
and
said,
if
we
give
him
life,
is
there
any
possibility
of
parole?
now,
this
is
the
simmons
question.
recall
that
simmons
is
a
right
of
rebuttal.
it
is
not
a
right
to
have
the
defendant's
technical
legal
status
on
the
day
of
his
sentencing
hearing
exhibited
to
the
jury.
it
is
a
right
to
rebut
an
issue
that
the
state
brings
into
the
case
in...
under
virginia
law.
and
under
virginia
law,
it
was
joined
much
more
vigorously
than
it
ever
was
in
simmons.
in
simmons,
it
was
a
non-statutory
factor
that
arguably
was
present
in
the
prosecutor's
jury
argument.
here
it
was
the
entire
legal
basis
for
the
state's
request
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
but
we
do
say
that
because
what
virginia
failed
to
do
is
to
look
not
at
the
single
statute,
but
at
the
entire
relevant
body
of
state
law
which
includes
the
provisions
of
state
law
that
i
was
citing
a
moment
ago
to
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
we
should
definitely--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--look
to
the
virginia
law
if
the
state
gives
us
the
law
and
if
the
state
looks
at
the
relevant
state
law.
but
that
is
what
virginia
failed
to
do.
they
looked
not
at
the
issue...
in
effect,
the
issue
that
they
had
to
address--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
we
concede
that...
that
under
virginia
law,
his
ineligibility
had
not
yet
been
formally
declared,
but
when
one
takes
into
consideration
the
other
provisions
of
virginia
law,
we
by
no
means
concede
that
there
was
any
possibility
of
his
ever
being
paroled.
and
that
is
the
question
in
rebuttal
that...
that
it
was
so
crucial
in
this
case
and
that
simmons
recognized
what
the...
a
defendant
has
a
due
process
right
to
have
the
jury
know
about.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
although--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that's
correct.
now,
that
is
certainly
a...
a
question
that
is...
that
is...
that
arises
from
state
law,
but
i
think
it's
tremendously
important
in
this
case
that
the
virginia...
it...
we
do
not
disagree
with
an
answer
from
the
virginia
supreme
court
that
we
don't
like.
virginia
never
addressed
that
question.
and
the
commonwealth
now
says
that
that
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
simmons,
that
the
state
court
was
under
no
obligation,
in
effect,
to...
to
say
what
the
correct
answer
to
the
jury's
question
was,
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
simmons.
simmons--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--if...
well,
simmons
of
course
said
lifetime.
and
it
would
arguably,
i
think,
be
an
extension
of
simmons
to...
to
change
that.
and
of
course,
we
cannot
extend
simmons
in
habeas
and
i
recognize
that.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
do
concede
that.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
yes,
we
absolutely
believe
that.
recalling
of
course--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--precisely.
precisely.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
exactly
correct.
and--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--but
that
was
not
the
answer
under
virginia
law.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
and
i
think
that's
very
clear.
i
mean,
the
state
has--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--exactly.
exactly.
and
that
is
the
question
with
which
simmons
is
concerned.
that's
why
i
say...
and
it
is
clearly
established--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
it...
it
arises--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
yes,
that's
correct,
with
the
exception
of
remote
hypothetical
possibilities.
and
in
simmons--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--nothing
is
absolute
except
death.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
but
it
would
not
apply
the
rule
in
simmons.
it
would
change
and
constrict
the
rule
in
simmons.
and
the
best
proof
of
that
is
the
fact
of
simmons
itself
because
if
virginia
was
correct
that
the
rule
of
simmons
only
can
be
called
upon
when
state
law
has
already
affixed
the
stamp
of
parole
ineligibility
to
a
defendant,
then
simmons
would
have
lost
the
case.
and
the
reason
for
that,
as
the
state
pointed
out
in
their
brief
in
simmons,
is
that
under
south
carolina
law...
and
there
was
state
case
law,
the
state
against
mckay,
state
against
torrence,
making
this
very
clear,
that
in
south
carolina,
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
two
strikes
and
you're
out
statute
that
was
involved
in
simmons
prohibits
parole
is
made
not
by
the
sentencing
court.
in
fact,
it
may
not
be
made
by
the
sentencing
court.
it
is
made
after
conviction
by
the
parole
board.
and
the
court
may
not
make
that
decision.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
south
carolina
created
the
rule
of
no
comment
that
was
partially
invalidated
in
simmons.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
the
decision
had
not
yet
been
made.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
and
had
the
attorney
general
of
south
carolina
taken
the
view
that
the
commonwealth
takes
now,
they
would
have
made
exactly
the
same
argument
and
said,
well,
there
are
statutory
exceptions.
perhaps
the
parole
board...
there's
no
south
carolina
case
construing
these
exceptions
to
the
two
strikes
and
you're
out
rule.
we
don't
know
that
the
south
carolina
parole
board
might
not
have
said
that
his
priors
were
part
of
a
continuing
course
of
conduct,
takes
him
out
of
the
rule.
and
all
kinds
of
things
could
happen.
lightning
might
strike,
and
that
in
effect
is
virginia's
argument
here,
that
lightning
might
strike.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--everything
in
simmons
had
not
occurred
either
because
under
south
carolina
law,
which
is
different
than
virginia's,
the
parole
board
has
to
make
a
factual
determination.
now,
it's
true
that
the
antecedent--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--the
only
factor
that
remained...
i...
i
don't
believe
it's
a
real
distinction
because...
because
of
the
difference
between
south
carolina
law...
but
the...
and...
and
virginia.
but
the
only
factor
that
remained
here
was
that
19
days
hence
judgment
would
be
entered
on
this
armed
robbery
conviction.
now,
what...
what
is
so
revealing
about
this...
and
recalling,
of
course,
that
we're
dealing
with
the
right
of
rebuttal.
the
state
says
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
jurors,
will
he
commit
acts
of
violence
in
the
future...
not
will
he
be
a
dangerous
person.
that's
not
the
sentencing
question.
it's
will
he
commit
acts
of
violence
in
the
future
that
will...
that
will...
or
that
would
pose
a
substantial
threat
to
society.
now,
that
is
the
issue
that
the
state
joined
in
this
case,
and
under
simmons,
he
was
allowed
to
give
the
critical
information
that
he
was...
whatever
threat
he
might
pose,
was
going
to
be
in
prison.
now,
the
state,
as
i
say,
has
never
offered
a
suggestion,
just
as
the
virginia
supreme
court
certainly
offered
no
suggestion,
of
how
on
the
level
of
reality
this
ineligibility
could...
could
fail
to
become
final.
but
finally
in
the
brief,
they
do
make
two
suggestions,
and
the
suggestions
show
why
virginia
has
been
so
reticent
about
engaging
this
on
the
level
of
reality
up
till
now
because
both
suggestions...
one
is
that
the
prosecutor
in
the
other
case
might
decide
to
null
pros
the
case
after
the
jury's
guilty
verdict,
and
the
other
suggestion
is
that
the
judge
might
whimsically
decide
to
dismiss
it.
now,
this
i
think
can
only
be
described
as
unlawful
behavior
or
certainly
arbitrary
behavior,
and
that
cannot
be
the
foundation
for
a
finding
that
there
was...
that
the
answer
to
the
jury's
question
in
this
case,
the
simmons
question,
was
yes.
the
answer
to
the
jury's
question
was
no.
now,
it
is
true
that
lightning
might
strike,
but
it
was
true
in
simmons.
and
the
simmons
plurality
listed
some
of
the
ways
in
which
lightning--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--exactly
the
same
thing
would
apply.
in
fact,
simmons
itself
was
based
on
guilty
pleas.
the...
the
guilty--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--a
guilty
plea
is
at
least
conclusive
as
a
jury's
verdict.
it's
an
admission
of
everything
necessary
to
support
the
judgment.
in
the
absence
of
any
reason
to
doubt
the
validity
of
that
guilty
plea,
we
have
the
same
issue.
but
of
course--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that
would
be...
and...
and
i
think
that's
a
nice
way
of
restating
the
holding
of
simmons
in--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--simmons
does
not
apply.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if...
i
do
not
believe
that
simmons
could
be
read
to
extend
that
far
without
extending
it.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
we
don't
even
know
if
it's
going
to
be
prosecuted.
but
this
is
a
situation
where
a
jury's
verdict,
or
in
the
hypothetical
a
guilty
plea,
has
been
rendered,
and
that
puts
this
in
a
different...
it
is
always
possible,
of
course,
to
imagine--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
this
is...
this
is
a
question
of
law,
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
there
will
be
no
doubt
whatsoever.
indeed,
this
issue
can
no
longer
arise
under
virginia
law.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
we
did
not
use
that
term
in
our...
in
our
brief.
we
took--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
i...
i
think
that
is...
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
the
question
is
any
possibility,
excepting
remote
hypothetical...
remote
hypothetical
possibilities.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
does.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i...
i
would
be
quite
comfortable
with
that.
finally,
before
i
sit
down,
i...
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
this...
this
would
be
a
different
case
had
virginia
engaged
that
analysis,
but
they
did
not.
a
state
court's
determination...
a
state
charges
with
us
arguing
about
state
law.
that's
not
right
at
all.
had
virginia
asked
that
question,
the
simmons
question,
in
effect
the
jury's
question,
and
answered
it
based
on
state
law,
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
case
in
which
a
federal
court
could
go
behind
that.
it
would
really
require
i
think
a
showing
that
the
state
court's
answer
was
in
some
sense
a
deliberate
evasion
of
the...
of
the
federal
right.
but
virginia
did
not
address,
let
alone
answer,
that
question.
and
that
is
why
the
decision
here
is
contrary
to
simmons
because
that
is
the...
the
question
in
simmons.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
let...
let
us
recall
that
he
was
working
under
the
strictures
of
virginia
law,
which
were
absolutely
settled.
he
was...
he
was
floundering
trying
to
fashion
something--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--and
it
was
pre-simmons.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
he
was
halfway
through,
thinking
on
his
feet
about
how
he
could
fashion
something
that
wouldn't
contradict
virginia
law,
which
is
contrary
to
simmons.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
of
course,
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
not,
in
any
sense,
base
its
decision
on
that,
but
reached
the
merits.
if
i
may.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
your
honor
please,
really
the
only
point
i'd
like
to
respond
to
is
this
idea
of
slippery
slope
that
virginia
advances.
i
would
suggest
that
if
there
is
any
slippery
slope
on
this
case,
it
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue.
if...
if
the...
the
due
process
rule,
the
right
of
rebuttal
rule
in
simmons
were
now
to
give
way
to
something
so
constrained
by
formalism
and
an
arid
explication
of
what
state
law
says
parole
eligibility
means,
to
the
exclusion
of
the
federal
question,
if
simmons
is
to
be
contracted
in
ramdass
v.
angelone
to
mean
that,
then
states
that
no
longer
wish
to
be...
to
abide
by
simmons
at
all
have
a
road
map
to
opt
out
of
the
simmons
principle.
and
i
think
the
south
carolina
procedure
is
a
perfect
way
of
doing
it,
to
delay
the
formal
declaration,
and
there
could
be
some
sorts
of
factual
determinations,
none
of
which
would
be
in
doubt.
there
would
be
no
suspense
about
any
of
it,
but
the
time
had
not
yet
come
when
the
jury
wants
to
know
the
answer,
so
you
never
have
to
tell
them.

one
need
not
go
so
far.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i'm
really
not
worried
about
it
because
i
don't
think
that...
that
this
court
will
restrict
south
carolina
in
such
a
way.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
that
leads
me
to
my
last
point,
which
is
that
simmons
has
been
accepted
very
comfortably
by
the
states.
in
fact,
even
before
simmons,
there
were
very
few
state
courts
that
did
not
go
further
than
what
simmons
held
was
required
by
due
process,
and
now
there
are
almost
none.
virginia
itself
no
longer
has
this
whole
procedure.
they
now
have
eliminated
parole
for
everybody
and
they
tell
everybody
in
every
case
whether
future
dangerousness
is
argued
or
not.
yarborough
v.
commonwealth.
they
have
gone
beyond
simmons.
so,
the...
the
issue
of...
of
what
was
a
small
change
in
the
law
at
the
time
of
simmons
is
no
longer
controversial.
it
is
in
repose,
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
most
unwise
and
most
unfortunate
for
this
court
to
reawaken
what
was
a
small
controversy
4,
5,
6
years
ago
and
is
now
no
controversy
at
all.
thank
you.
