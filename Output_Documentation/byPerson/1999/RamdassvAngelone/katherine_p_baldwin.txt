ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
whether
the
virginia
supreme
court
erred,
as
was
stated
this
morning.
the
question
is
not
even
whether
ramdass'
claim
could
possibly
fall
within
the
ambit
of
the
sentence.
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
whether,
under
2254(d),
the
virginia
supreme
court's
decision
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law.
so,
unless
ramdass'
claim
of
functional
review
of
parole
ineligibility
is
somehow
clearly
established
federal
law,
unless
in
other
words,
it
falls
within
the
four
corners
of
simmons,
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
relief
in
this
collateral
case.
and
that's...
that's
an
important
distinction
here.
he
cannot
meet
that
requirement
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
look
at
simmons.
in
the
four
corners
of
simmons,
nowhere
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form,
implicitly
or
explicitly,
is
this
functional
view
of
parole
eligibility
voiced
or
discussed.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
justice
souter,
the
reason
why
we
can't
even
consider
that
argument
under
2254(d)
is
because
it's
not
contained
in
simmons.
that
argument
has
been
gleaned
from
the
briefs
that
were...
that
were
submitted
by
south
carolina
and
by
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
case.
nowhere
in
the
case--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
a
reasonable
jurist
and...
and
objectively
reasonably
could
have
looked
at
the
opinion
in
simmons
and
determined,
because
of
the
tremendous
repetition
of
the
phrase,
ineligible
under
state
law,
almost...
the
word
parole
ineligible
was
almost
never
standing
alone.
it's
always
coupled,
multiple
times,
in...
in
both
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
o'connor
and
in
the
plurality
opinion,
over
and
over
of
ineligible
under
state
law.
and
that
can
only
have
one
meaning
in
virginia,
and
that
means
upon
entry
of
a
judgment
order.
nowhere
else--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--correct,
but
we
cannot--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
we
cannot...
first
of
all,
we
cannot
impute
anything
in
the
briefs
or
the
oral
argument
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
and
the
determination
under
2254(d)
is
whether
the
virginia
supreme
court's
decision
was
a
reasonable
application
of
simmons.
so,
right
there,
we
cannot
look
at
what...
unless
this
court
is
going
to
rule,
which
i
don't
think
it
possibly
could,
that
a...
that
a
state
supreme
court
not
only
is
now
responsible
for
reasonably
applying
the
opinion
from
this
court,
but
also
must
go
behind
that
to
determine
what
implicitly
the
court
meant
by
reference
to
the
briefs,
et
cetera.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
not
covered
by
simmons,
justice
o'connor?
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
because
in
that
case,
i
think
it
would
present
a
different
case,
one
in
which
once
presumably
the
defendant
found
out
about
this,
it
would
be
his
duty
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
a
court.
and
if
some
error
of
state
law
occurred...
for
instance,
let's...
let's
assume
that
actually
the
order
had
been
entered
on
that
third
case
and
the
judge
in
ramdass'
capital
case
didn't
even
know
about
it.
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
clear
error
of
state
law.
that
would
be
the
defendant's
duty
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
take
it
up
on
appeal
and
get
reversed.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
don't
understand
the
question.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it
would--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--it
would
depend
on
what
the
state
law
is
on
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
justice
breyer,
is
your
question
that
under
that
particular
state's
law,
those
are
factors
that
go
into
the
state's
determination--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--of
parole
eligibility?
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
if
the
state
law
is...
and...
and,
justice
breyer,
i
disagree
that
the
entry
of
a
judgment
order
on
conviction
is
anything
technical
or...
or
formalistic--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--whatsoever.
the
fourth
circuit
rule...
and
i...
and
i
think
it's
correct,
that
the
entry
of
a
judgment
order
making
someone...
divesting
someone
of
eligibility
for
parole
is
not
a
trivial
matter.
it's
a
very...
what
the
fourth
circuit
termed
an
age-old
rule,
that
before--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--my
view
is
that
under
the
laws
that
exist
today,
under
the
four
corners
of
simmons,
that
if
he
is
ineligible
under
state
law,
he
gets
the
simmons
instruction,
and
if
he
is
eligible
under
state
law,
he
does
not.
now,
if
this
court
wants
to
extend
that
due
process
right
by
some
extra
considerations
of
other
procedures
or
taking
into
account
some
other
state's
procedures
and
wants
to
expand
on
simmons,
then
it
must
do
so
in
that
case
on
direct
appeal,
not
collateral
review.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
under...
currently
under
simmons,
yes,
justice
breyer.
and
of
course,
there's...
to
my
knowledge
there's
no
such
state
that
has
that
type
of
parole
law.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
wrong
about
my
interpretation.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
i
would
not
lose
in
this
case
because
my
case
does
not
present
those
facts.
my
case...
i
don't
think
under
any
interpretation
of
2254(d),
it
could
be
said
that
the
virginia
supreme
court's
interpretation...
application
of
simmons
was
unreasonable,
objectively
or
otherwise.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--justice
o'connor,
it
was
not.
ramdass'
argument
on
that
point
is...
is
completely
wrong
on
virginia
law.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
he
has
conceded
that...
that
the
authority
in
virginia
gives
to
a
circuit
court
the
authority
to
vacate
or
set
aside
a
jury's
conviction
before
entry
of
judgment.
he
has
conceded
that
point.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
he
certainly
may,
yes,
your
honor.
it's...
it's--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
there
are
many
more,
justice
souter.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
it's...
it's
virginia
supreme
court
3a:
15
gives
a
circuit
court
unfettered
authority
to
set
aside
the
judgment.
now--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i...
i
think
that
absolutely
what
could
occur
in
that
sentencing--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--they
certainly
do.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
now,
it
may
not
be--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
do
not
have
case
examples,
justice
souter.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
that
what
could
go
into
a
judge's
thinking
is
when
presented
with
some
error
of
law
that
occurred
at
trial...
and
we
have...
this
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
what
ramdass
was
prepared
to
argue
at
that
sentencing
hearing
in
the
domino's
pizza
case.
but
he
could
have--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--no.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no.
he
had...
what
he
had
rejected...
and
this
is
what
has
been
kind
of
unclear
from
ramdass'
argument.
what
he
had
rejected
were
your
typical
motions
to
strike
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no.
he
was...
he
was
set
for
a
sentencing
hearing,
which
meant
at
that
hearing
he
could
have
filed
a
motion
to
set
aside
because
of
some
legal
error
that
occurred
at
trial.
a
judge
and
a
prosecutor
both
could
very
well
in
that
case,
after
he
had
already
had
a
death
sentenced
entered,
decide
that
they
do
not
want
to
risk
having
some
bad
legal
ruling
go
up
on
appeal.
that...
that's
a
perfectly...
that
could
happen
anytime.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no.
no,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
in
the...
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
he
had
a
right
under
rule
3a:
15
to
file
a
motion
to
set
aside--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--for
legal
error.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
to
my
knowledge,
the
only
thing
that
was--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
believe
not
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
i
believe
he
made--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--on
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
as
far
as
i
know.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
the
record
doesn't
show
what
other
possible
legal
errors
there
are.
we
just
don't
know
what
he
could
have
done
at
that
hearing.
we
have
no
idea.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
that's
not
the
rule
in
virginia,
justice
souter.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
not
the
rule
in
virginia.
the
rule
in
virginia,
under
the
virginia
supreme
court's
ruling,
is
once
the
conviction
order
is
entered,
at
that
point
then
the
department
of
corrections
can
consider
that
conviction.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
many
other
reasons.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
because
that's
not
what
the
law
in
virginia
is
on
parole
ineligibility.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
i
think
that's
not
right
because
simmons
doesn't
speak
in
terms,
anywhere
in
the
opinion,
of...
of
some
separate
federal
issue
apart
from
what
state...
state
law
defines
as
ineligible.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it
would
be.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
simmons
does
not
require
the
instruction
unless
he
is
ineligible.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct,
if
he--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--if...
well,
but
simmons
tells
state
courts
very
clearly,
expressly
a
very
narrow
exception
to
the
general
rule
was
carved
out
in
simmons.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that
because
i
think
what
simmons
expressly
says
is
that's
only
unfair
if
he
would
be
ineligible
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
you
have
to
look
at
when
a
state
court
is
reading
simmons,
is
it
reasonable
for
them
to
rule
and
to
decide...
read
simmons,
look
at
this
defendant.
if
he
was
eligible
for
parole,
then
simmons
simply
doesn't
apply.
and
there's
nothing
in
simmons
to
support
this
different
type
of
nebulous
standard
that
ramdass
is
now
proposing.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
not.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
believe--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
right.
that's
irrelevant.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
simmons--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--simmons
set...
simmons
set
a
threshold.
it
was
a
very
bright
line
rule
for
state
courts.
and...
and
i
believe
that
that
is...
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
this
morning
have
said
ramdass'
proposed
standard...
there's
no
way...
this
court
would
have
to
take
every
case
to
decide
on
the
facts
of
that
case--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--whether
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
this--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--this
court
may--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--this
court
may
want
to
say
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
it
would
have
to
say
that
in
that
case
on
direct
appeal
because
simmons
doesn't
say
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but,
justice
breyer,
the...
the
issue
is
not
what
is
implicit
in
simmons
under
2254(d).
the
issue
is
was
it
clearly
established,
and...
and
for
that
matter...
and
looking
at
whether
it
was
clearly
established
or
not,
even
3
years
after
simmons,
this
court
was
debating
in
brown
v.
texas.
three
members
of
the
court
joined
justice
stevens'
statement
regarding
denial
of
cert...
as
to
whether
simmons
might...
should
apply
to
defendants
who
are
eligible
for
parole
after
serving--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--ineligible
after
serving--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's...
but
that's
essentially
the
issue
that
ramdass
is
making
now.
i
think
simmons
should
apply
to
me
despite
the
fact
that
i
am
eligible
for...
that
i
am
eligible
for
parole
as
opposed
to
ineligible
for
parole.
if
that...
if
that
issue
was
debatable
on
this--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
if
that
domino's
pizza
case
had
not
been
entered...
and
it
may
not
have
been
at
that
time.
we're
now
looking
with
hindsight,
so
we
know
what
happened.
but
at
that
time,
no
one
could
say
with
certainty
that
would
happen.
and
if
that
had
not
been
entered,
you
can
be
sure
that
ramdass
would
have
been
fighting
tooth
and
nail
to
have
been
found
eligible
for
parole.
i
mean,
his
argument
would
have
been
completely
different.
he
would
not
have
an
argument
at
all
today.
his
argument
is
based
upon
a
misapprehension
of
state
law,
and
we
know
that
because
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
said
it.
the...
in
simmons,
this
court
repeatedly
used
the
phrase,
ineligible
under
state
law.
this
court,
3
years
after
simmons
in
brown
v.
texas,
was
telling
state
courts
it's
debatable
on
the
courts
still
as
to
pretty
much
the
extent
of
the
simmons
rule
as
applying
to
eligibles
or
ineligibles
for
parole.
you
cannot,
therefore,
go
back
and
say
that
the
virginia
supreme
court's
decision
was
in
any
way
objectively
unreasonable.
in
o'dell,
this
court
defined
simmons
as
that
narrow
exception
carved
out
of
the
general
rule.
it's
a
bright
line
rule.
the
court
found
under
state
law
and...
and
ramdass
does
not
take
exception
with
the
state
law
ruling
that
he
was
eligible
for
parole.
there
was...
there
is
nothing
in
simmons
to
say
that
there
is
some
separate
standard.
and
in
fact,
as
the
fourth
circuit
said...
and
i
think
they
were
correct...
anytime
we
get
into
a
discussion
of
parole
eligibility,
it
necessarily
is
going
to
collapse
into
a
discussion
of
state
law.
it's
not
like
a
case
where
you
have,
oh,
there's
some
subsidiary
state
law
kind
of
factual
findings
and
then
you
make
a
federal
law
determination.
simmons
is
uniquely
dependent,
completely,
unless
this
court
is
going
to
change
it
and
extend
it...
completely
dependent
on
what
state
law
is.
that's
the
way
simmons
was
written.
if
the
court
doesn't
like
it
and
wants
to
extend
it,
it
needs
to
do
that
in
a
case
on
direct
appeal.
it
cannot
do
it
in
a
collateral
case
under
2254(d)
because
you
cannot,
in
this
case,
look
at
simmons,
read
simmons,
and
say
that
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
was
unreasonable.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
according
to
simmons,
the
state
law
determines
whether
he's
eligible
or
not.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
they're
the
same.
under
the
way
that
simmons
was
written--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--if
the
federal...
if
you're
saying
the
federal
question
is
whether
he's
eligible
for
parole
or
not,
then
yes.
the
answer
is
yes
because
simmons,
as
currently
written,
would
give
a
reasonable
jurist
reading
it
that
impression.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
i
don't--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
don't
understand
it.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i'm
not
sure
what
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but
i
don't
see
how...
how
a
state
court,
looking
to
see
whether
someone
is
eligible
for
parole
or
not
under
state
law,
can
do
anything
else.
i
mean,
they
have
to
look
at
their
own
law--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
determine--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
i
think--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
then
i
think
the
federal
court
then
would
be
redetermining
state
law
ineligibility
for
parole,
and
that
is
not
contained
anywhere
in
simmons.
what
ramdass--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes.
this
court
could
have
said
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
what
ramdass'
real
complaint
here
is
simply
that
his
order
of
convictions
came
different
than
what
he
wishes
they
were.
that
claim
isn't
before
the
court.
he
never
preserved
that
claim.
if
he
wanted
to
have
preserved
that
claim,
he
should
have
asked
for
a
continuance
or
asked
for
something
to
make
him
ineligible
under
state
law
because
that's
his
real
complaint
here--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--one
that
was
never
made.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
but
you
can't
impute
that
certainly
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
reading
simmons
because
that
entire
argument--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--justice
stevens,
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
opinion
at
all.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
i
don't.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
no.
then
at
least
he
would
have--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--if
it
was...
if
that
was...
if
his
claim
of
a
different
standard
of
reviewing
parole
eligibility,
for
whatever
reason,
because
the
parole
board
in
south
carolina
hadn't
yet
announced
it
or--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
then
at
least
he'd
have
some
argument
here,
but
he
has
no
argument
here
because
simmons
doesn't
say
that.
i
mean,
at
least
then
he
might
have
a
basis
for
his
claim.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
to
my
knowledge--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--if
that's
true,
if
we
have
to
impute
that
to
state
courts
to
go
back
and
read
the
briefs
to
see
what
was
rejected,
justice
stevens--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
i
think
absent
it
somewhere
in
the
opinion,
you
simply
can't
say
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
unreasonably
applied
simmons.
