justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying...
i
guess
you're
saying...
that
the
question
of
what
is
a
sufficient
certainty
or
a
sufficient
probability,
if
you
will,
that
there
will
be
no
parole
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
that's
a
question
of
what
simmons
means,
and
simmons
was
a
constitutional
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
virginia
can
say,
yes,
in
this
sense
the...
the
ineligibility
is
yet
to
be
determined
because
a
decree
has
not
been
entered.
but
i
think
you're
saying
the
question
before
us,
the
simmons
question
is,
is
it
certain
to
a
sufficient
degree
of
probability,
however
we
may
want
to
articulate
that,
for
simmons
purposes,
that
he
will
not,
at
some
relevant
future
time,
be
parole
eligible
and
that's
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
take
it
you
would
accept
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
is
there
any
reasonable
doubt
that
this
person
will...
will
be
parole
eligible
at,
you
know,
some
future
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't...
why
don't
we
say
that
the
determination
is
a
determination
which
depends
both
on
law
and
on
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
making
that
next
determination,
we
require
a
very
high
standard
of
probability?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
this
connection,
would
you
comment
on...
on
your
brother's
argument
that
this
case
is
like
simmons
because
in
neither
case
was
there
a
decree
in
so
many
words
by
a
court
that
the
individual
was
parole
ineligible?
in
simmons,
the...
i
guess
the
parole
board
had...
had
never
come
to
that
conclusion,
and
in
this
case
the...
the
judgment
had
not
been
entered
in
the
third
case.
so,
he
said
it's
on
par
with
simmons.
would
you
comment
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
there
was...
there
was
no...
i
think
maybe
he
would
say,
even...
even
accepting
your
response,
there's
no...
there's
no
statement
in
simmons
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
an
entry
of...
of
a...
a
kind
of
definitive
order.
and
so,
if
one
wasn't
required
in
simmons,
wasn't...
one
isn't
required
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question...
the
question
is
what
it...
what
that
phrase
means
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and...
and
his
argument
is
that
it...
it
can't
mean
that
a...
a
definitive
decree,
stating
in
exactly
those
words,
parole
ineligible,
must
have
been
entered
because,
number
one,
the
simmons
opinion
didn't
say
so,
and
number
two...
i
think
this
is
correct...
the
record
in
simmons
indicated
that
there
had
been
no
such
decree
entered.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's...
but
that's
a
question
of
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have...
you
have
given
us
in
your
brief
a
couple
of
factual
scenarios
on
which
the
judge
might
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
no,
but
there
may
be
many
more,
but
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
what
seems
to
me
the
just
total
lack
of
reality
of
the
suggestions
you
make.
the
judge...
one
of
your
examples
was,
well,
the
judge
in
that
case
might
say,
look
at
this
poor
guy,
he's
just
been
convicted
of
murder,
we...
he
shouldn't
have
so
many
convictions
against
him.
so,
i'm
going
to
vacate
the
judgment
here.
i
mean,
that's
not
a
real
world
example.
and
if...
if
that's
the
basis
upon
which
you
think
something
might
happen
other
than
the
entry
of
judgment,
then
i...
i
just
don't
think
that
you've
got
a
realistic
argument.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
ever
known
of
a
circuit
court
that
said,
gee,
i
feel
so
sorry
for
this
fellow
because
he's
got
too
many
convictions
against
him,
i
think
i
won't
enter
judgment
in
this
most
recent
one?
do
you
have
an
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question
was
whether
you
had
an
example.
do
they
do
that
in
virginia?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
do?
you
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
won't
enter
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
suppose
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
then,
that
the...
that
the
parole
ineligibility
wouldn't
have
been
certain
upon
entry
of
judgment
by
the
trial
court
because
he
could
always
appeal.
an
appeal
could
always
reverse
it.
i
meant
there's...
there's
no
end--
justice
david
h.
souter
--pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
our
question
is
the
simmons
question.
the
federal
law
question
is,
is
the
ineligibility
certain
to
a
very
high
degree.
and...
and
you're
saying,
no,
it's
not
because
under
virginia
law,
entry
might
not
have
been
entered...
a
judgment
might
not
have
been
entered
on
this
conviction,
and
the
reason
might
be
because
the
judge
felt
sorry
for
him
or
for
some
other
reason
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
because
he
made
a...
a
motion
which
we
don't
now
have
before
us,
a
motion
that
might
have
led
the
judge
to
do
that.
and...
and
my
point
is,
if
that
possibility
is
sufficient
for
simmons
purposes
to
say
that
his
parole
ineligibility
is
uncertain,
then
the
possibility
of
his
appeal
and
some
success
on
appeal
should
equally
lead
to
an
uncertainty
that
would
bar
the
application
of
simmons.
why...
why
isn't
that
line
of
reasoning
sound?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i'm
suggesting
the...
the
law
of
the
united
states
under
simmons,
and
you're
saying
that
the...
the
possibility
that
judgment
may
not
be
entered
makes
the
ineligibility
point
too
uncertain
to
apply
simmons.
and
all
i'm
saying
is,
if
that
is
sound,
then
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
in
virginia,
upon
which
he
might
get
relief,
presumably
also
makes
ineligibility
too
uncertain
to
apply
simmons.
isn't
that
right?
