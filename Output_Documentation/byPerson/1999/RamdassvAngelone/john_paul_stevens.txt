justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
point
is
the
decision
had
not
yet
been
made.
this
isn't
his
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by...
by
the
authority
who
had
the
authority
to
make
the
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this
point?
is
it
not
correct,
whether
we
call
it
federal
law
or
state
law,
if
we
look
at
the
concurring
opinion
in
simmons,
that
if
the
judge
had
given
an
instruction...
but
as
you
say,
he
didn't
really
have
to
give...
saying
that
as
things
look
right
now,
if
that
judgment
is
entered,
he'll
be
ineligible
for
parole.
the
prosecutor
would
have
been
entirely
free
to
ask
the
judge
to
say
yes,
but
that
judgment
might
be
set
aside
on
appeal.
it
might
not
be
entered.
he
might
escape.
there
might
be
commutation.
there
might
be
a
change
in
the
law,
and
there
might
be
a
pardon.
so,
the...
that
even
if
the
instruction
had
been
given,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
this
uncertainty
in
the
picture,
it...
perhaps
the
prosecutor
could
easily
have
cleared
that
up
and
said
nothing
in
life
is
certain
because
of
all
these
factors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
one
of
the
points
that's
made
in
simmons
is
that
the
prosecutor
has
this
option
of
being
sure
that
the
information
is
not
misleading.
see,
that's
what...
the
main
thing
we're
looking
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
not
misleading
the
jurors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
also
pointed
out
how
unfair
it
is
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
an
argument
about
future
dangerousness
and
conceal
the
fact
that
he's
not
likely
to
get
out
of
prison.
it...
that
argument
is
also
in
the
concurring
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how...
is
your
answer
to
their
argument
that
the
same
thing
was
really
true
in
south
carolina
because
the
parole
board
hadn't
yet
made
him
ineligible
for
parole,
that
that's
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion?
is
that
your
answer
to
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
though
that's
part
of
our
holding,
our
opinion
didn't
explain
that
and
therefore
the
state
court
wasn't
on
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
know
it
isn't,
but
it
was
in
the
briefs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
you...
but
if
that
fact
had
been
spelled
out,
do
you
think
simmons
would
have
been
decided
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
so,
then
isn't...
isn't
it
fair
to
say
even
though
that
was
the
holding
and
the
only
unfairness
for
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
it
wasn't
spelled
out
in
the
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
had
read
the
briefs
and
knew
that
was
a
fact,
do
you
think
they
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
argument
would
be
the
same
argument
you're
making
here,
that
he
really
was
not
yet
ineligible
for
parole
because
the
parole
board
had...
had
not
yet
entered
the
order
that
made
him
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
simmons
decided
that.
simmons
decided
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
argument
was
on
the
table
and
the
court
didn't
think
it
was
strong
enough
even
to
mention
in
the
opinion
and
yet
rejected
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
that
or
we
have
to
assume
that
most
state
courts
would
react
to
that
argument
the
same
way
we
reacted
to
that
argument,
that
it's
so
obviously
frivolous
that
to
wait
for
that
meaningless
delay,
that
that
shouldn't
change
the
result.
