we'll

argument
next
in

96-7000,
bobby
lee
ramdass
v.
ronald
angelone.
mr.
bruck.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the...
the
court
engrafted
that
onto
simmons.
but
i...
i
thought
that
simmons
had
simply
spoken
in
terms
of
eligibility
for
parole
under
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you...
how
can
you
say
it
implicitly
looked
at
all
of
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
but
the
plurality
is
not
the
controlling
opinion
in
that
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say...
now,
tell
me
again.
when
you
say
it,
what
are
you
referring
to?
the
plurality
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
shouldn't
we
look
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
for
that
decision
as
to...
i
mean,
are
you
saying
that
the
state
supreme
court
in
deciding
a
question
of
whether
someone
was
parole
eligible
made
a
mistake
of
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
you
saying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you...
you
concede,
don't
you,
that
under
the
law
of
virginia,
this
person
was
not
eligible
for
parole
at
the...
at
the
critical...
or
was
eligible
for
parole
at...
at
the
critical
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
would
be
a
much
easier
rule
to
apply
than
the
one
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
issue
of
reasonable
doubt,
as
you've
now
phrased
the
thing...
is
that...
that
submitted
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
issue
of
law.
ordinarily
you
don't
speak
of
an
issue
of
law
as
being
decided
on
a
basis
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
agreed
with
justice
souter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bruck.
ms.
baldwin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
concurring
opinion
in
simmons
pointed
out
that
this
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule,
that
you
ordinarily
don't
get
into
this
subject
because
it
can
be
so
confusing
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
baldwin.
mr.
bruck,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
simmons
itself
was
a
mistake.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruck.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-7000
ramdass
versus
angelone,
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
