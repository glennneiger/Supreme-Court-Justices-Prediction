justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
the
state
can
regulate
just
whenever
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
the
parent
says,
no
candy.
the
state
says,
oh,
that's
unreasonable.
kids
ought
to
have
some
candy.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
very
little
intrusion.
give
the
kid
some
candy
once
a
week.
[laughter]
alternate
fridays,
or
whatever.
this
is
an
enormous
intrusion?
and
you
think
the
state
can
tell
parents
because
that's
in
the
interests
of
the
child,
according
to
the
state,
or
according
to
one
judge
who
sits
as
the
agent
of
the
state
and
likes
candy?
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
need
or
an
ability
to
pay,
but
i
mean,
let's
assume
these
people
lay
out
a
lot
of
money
but
in
fact,
you
know,
they
have
it.
it's
just
money
that
would
have
gone
to
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
impoverished.
it's
just
cost
them
$100,000
to
defend
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
remedy
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
enough
of
a
constitutional
issue,
that
it
is
her
decision?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--such
as
whether
the
kind
can
eat
candy
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
thought
that
was
the
parents'
call.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
don't
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
do
you
get
the
notion
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
is
the
standard
somehow
in
the
common
law
world?
we
certainly
use
that
where
there's
been
a
divorce
or
separation,
and
you
have
to
decide
between
the
two
parents,
but
when
it's
not
the
parents
involved,
can
you
give
me
any
cases
where...
it
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
a
lot
of
children
to
take
them
away
from
their
parents
and
give
them
to
somebody
else,
but
the
parents
have
rights
in
the
children.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
grant
visitation
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i...
you're
talking
about
best
interests
of
the
child
as
though
that's
the
generally
well
accepted
common
law
rule
for
what
courts
can
do
with
regard
to
children.
they
can
do
whatever
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
i
don't...
i'm
unaware
that
that's
our
general
rule
at
all.
where
there's
a
dispute
between
the
parents,
that
will
be
resolved
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
but
where
it's
a
dispute
between
the
parents
and
someone
else,
you
think
common
law
courts
just
say,
well,
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child?
it
seems
to
me
they
say,
well,
what
do
the
parents
want?
they
don't
want
the
kid
to
eat
candy,
the
kid
doesn't
eat
candy.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
child
does
not
belong
the
court.
the
child
belongs
to
the
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
even
though
they
might
come
up
accidentally
with
a
result
that
you
could
have
decided
properly
under
a
proper
standard--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
standard
here,
which
is
simply
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
is
always
wrong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
applied
in
every
case
to
which
this
statute
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
apply
that,
i
suppose,
also
to
the
case
of
the
no
good
black
sheep
husband
who
has
abandoned
his
wife
and
child,
and
then
the
wife
dies,
and
the
husband
suddenly
reappears
and
decides
what
will
happen
to
the
child,
i
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
this
is
a
parent.
i
mean,
this
is
the
father.
there's
no
doubt
that
he
was
the
biological
father,
and
i
suppose
he
would
be
entitled
to
custody
if
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
there's
got
to
be
blood
and
a
history
of
intimate
association
in
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
statute
require
that?
bear
in
mind
that
you're
trying
to
sustain
the
burden
of
saying
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
all
its
applications,
but
you've
just
said
that
it's
certainly
not
unconstitutional
in
the
application
where
the
parent
who
is
trying
to
determine
the
future
behavior
of
the
child
is
this
no
good
black
sheep
father
who
hasn't
been
with
the
child.
now,
there's
at
least
one
situation
where
you
could
apply
the
rule
of
this
statute
constitutionally,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
come
back
to
my
no
good
black
sheep
runaway--
justice
antonin
scalia
--runaway
husband--
[laughter]
--because
i'm
worried
about
that
being
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
this
statute
might...
maybe
the
answer
to
that
case
is
that
that
husband
would
first
have
to
seek
custody
of
the
children,
and
custody
would
be
denied.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
he
were
granted
custody,
then
you
would
say
it
would
play
out
the
same
way
your
case
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
i
understand...
i
understand
the
dichotomy
you
draw
between
a
harm
to
the
child
standard
and
a
best
interests
of
the
child
standard.
i'm
not
so
sure
about
your
fallback
standard,
which
is,
you
think
it
would
be
okay
if
you
applied
not
a
best
interests
of
the
child
standard,
but
a
standard
to
the
effect
that
the
parent
who
has
custody
is
not
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
you
don't
think
that
that's
much
different
from
the
judge
deciding
what
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
you
don't
mean
that
what
the
parent
has
decided
to
do
is
not
in
the
child's
best
interest.
you're
applying
a
subjective
standard?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
the
parent
subjectively
is
trying
to
do
what
is
best
for
the
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
no.
i
mean,
you
could
not
harm
the
child,
but
still
not
be
acting
in
the
child's
best
interests.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
no
different
from
harm,
the
way
you're
describing--
