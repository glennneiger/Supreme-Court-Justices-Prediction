justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me
something
about
your
case.
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
the
law.
i
want
to
know
something
about
your
case.
all
right.
now,
suppose
i
think
the
constitution
doesn't
permit
people
to
wander
in
at
random.
even
if
it's
good
for
a
child
to
learn
the
accordion,
an
accordion
player
couldn't
come
in
and
say,
i
want
to
visit
once
a
year,
even
if
the
interference
is
trivial,
all
right.
so
i
start
with
that,
and
i
also
think
maybe
you
could
make
out
a
case
that
yours
isn't
that
case.
you
have
something
special
going
for
you,
so
that
if
it's
applied
to
you,
maybe
you
could
win.
now,
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
how
minimal
an
interference
it
is.
it
isn't
much
of
an
interference
to
play
the
accordion
once
a
year,
okay.
i
want
to
hear
what's
special
about
your
relationship
in
your
case
that
could
overcome
some
kind
of
special
burden
that
might
be
imposed
before
somebody
can
come
in
off
the
street
and
start
hauling
mothers
into
court.
is
there
anything
in
your
situation
that's
special
and,
if
so,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
are
you
satisfied...
that
is,
suppose
we
were
to
say
from
your
point
of
view
that
of
course
you
must
show
a
substantial
relationship
in
the
past,
plus
harm.
now,
some
harm
and
loss
of
a
substantial
relationship
could
count
as
harm.
if
it
were
that,
then
what
happens
to
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
setting
a
constitutional
standard.
we're
not
running
public
relation...
domestic
relations
law,
so
suppose
the
outside
limit
were,
the
state's
free
to
do
this
if
it
shows
harm
to
the
child,
that
loss
of
a
substantial
relationship
could
count
as
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
were
the
constitutional
standard,
what
would
happen
to
your
case?
would
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
the
divorce--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
we
do
in...
i
mean,
unhappy
families
are
all
different,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
happens
where
there
are
custody
proceedings,
there
are
very
complex
situations,
where
children...
suppose
you're
already
in
court
in
a
domestic
relations
case
and
there's
some
complex
situation,
has
to
do
with
a
stepfather,
cousins,
no
relationships...
there
are
all...
and
sometimes
domestic
relations
judges
have
to
work
out
very,
very
detailed
orders
in
highly
complex
situations,
and
do
you
want
to
say
there,
too,
what
we're
doing
is
giving
a
constitutional
veto
to
a
natural
mother,
where
she's
already
in
court
and
it's
one
of
these
complex
situations?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
circumstances
where
the
mother
has
problems,
where
they've
been
raised
by
foster
families,
where
there
are
schooling
problems,
where
there's
a
search
for
stable
relationships,
where
the
child's
interest
is
what
the
judge
is
thinking
of,
and
sometimes
he
has
to
work
out
something
that's
highly
detailed.
why
should
the
mother
in
that
kind
of
ongoing
situation
suddenly
have
a
kind
of
veto?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
a
domestic
relations...
are
you...
you
know
a
lot
about
this
area,
i
hope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
are
there...
look,
if
we
get
out
of
the
problem
i
raised
in
that
way--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
also
lurking
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
not
this
case.
i'm
not
thinking
of
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
worried
about
words
that
will
affect
other
cases.
now,
are
there
other
kinds
of
proceedings
where
it's
not
exactly
custody,
but
there's
this
kind
of
complexity
that's
worrying
me,
where
the
stability
of
the
child...
you
know,
and
you
can't
say
harm.
the
judge
is
out
there
writing
a
rather
detailed
order,
and
he
can't
prove
harm
in
respect
to
every
word
in
that
detailed
order.
are
there
other
things
we
should
be
writing
into
this
that
this
case
isn't?
