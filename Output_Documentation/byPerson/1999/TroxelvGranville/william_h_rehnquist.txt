chief
justice
william

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-138,
jenifer
troxel
v.
tommie
granville.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
always
considered
the
supreme
court
of
washington
agreed
with
what
you
just
said.
i
had
thought
that
the
state
statute
said
best
interests
of
the
child,
and
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said
that
you
can't
get
a
third
party
visitation
rights
as
against
the
parent
unless
you
can
show
harm,
which
suggests
that
they
thought
the
two
might...
were
mutually
exclusive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
best
interests
standard
would
cover
a
much
broader
spectrum
than
the
harm
standard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
show,
don't
you,
that
at
least
this
visitation
order
is
constitutionally
permissible?
the
supreme
court
of
washington
i
guess
struck
down
the
entire
statute,
and
the
argument
you
make,
which
i
think
has
some
force
to
it,
is
that
you
don't
lightly
strike
down
an
entire
statute,
and...
but
you
do
have,
from
your
point
of
view
to
avoid
that
you
have
to
show
that
there's
at
least
some
order
that
could
be
issued
consistent
with
this
statute
which
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
and...
i
think
your
problem,
probably,
is
to
what
extent
can
a
court
intervene
in
the
case
of
parents
who
are
not
harming
the
child
to
say
that
outsiders
such
as
grandparents
can
have
a
court
ordered
visitation
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
have
a
line
of
cases
not
directly
on
point,
but
that
cut
the
other
way,
i
think.
that
is,
the
parents,
it's
up
to
the
parents
to
decide,
you
know,
not
just
who
has
custody,
how
the
kids
are
going
to
be
brought
up,
who
they're
going
to
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
mean
that
next
a
great
aunt
can
come
in
and
say,
well,
you
know,
i
want
to
take
her
to
the
movies
every
friday?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
i
think
i
disagree
with
justice
souter
as
to
the
standard
you
have
to
meet,
but
i
think
we're
both
focusing
on
the
same
kind
of
thing.
my
understanding
is
that,
unless
you're
talking
about
the
area
of
the
first
amendment,
if
a
statute
is
to
be
stricken
down
on
its
face,
as
the
supreme
court
of
washington
did
here,
you
must...
the
person
supporting
that
must
show
that
there
are
no
possible
applications
of
the
statute
that
would
be
permissible.
so...
but
whether
justice
souter
is
right
that
you
have
to
show
that
almost
all
applications
would
be
permissible,
or
whether
i'm
right
that
you
have
to
show
just
that
an
appli...
i'm
still
not
persuaded
that
you
have
shown
even
that
the
order
in
this
case
is...
avoids
constitutional
difficulties.
you
say
that
the
intrusion
is
minimal,
and
there
are
no
religious
or
discriminatory
implications.
is
that
the
substance
of
the
constitutional
test
that
you
seek?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
ms.
smith,
i
hope
you
will
address
yourself
to
the
question
that
we've
also
addressed
to
mr.
olson,
whether
the...
what
exactly
was
the
visitation
order
in
this
case?
was
it
one
weekend
a
month?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
an
order
of
one
weekend
a
month
on
the
facts
of
this
case
violates
the
federal
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
say
address,
or
dress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
address.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
this
court,
you
mean
the
supreme
court
of
washington?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
get...
range
that
broadly,
ms.
smith,
i'm
very
much
bothered
by
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
here
struck
down
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
an
entire
statute,
not
simply
saying
it
couldn't
apply
in
this
case
or
that
case,
and
i
think
our
constitutional
rule
for
federal
purposes
is
that
to
do
that
you
have
to
show
that
no
conceivable
circumstances
could
the
statute
be
constitutionally
applied,
and
i
take
it
you're
taking
that
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
cases
where
it
wouldn't
be
constitutional
i
don't
think
helps
you,
unless
you
can
show
that
there
are
no
cases
in
which
it
would
be
constitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
could
easily
have
done
it
here,
but
they
simply
refused
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
supreme
court
of
washington
wouldn't
construe
this
statute
to
require
harm,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
they're
going
to
construe
the
follow
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-138,
troxel
against
granville
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
