but
mr.
olson,
isn't
that
some--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
olson,
isn't
that
something
for
the
washington
supreme
court
to
spell
out
case
by
case?
after
all,
it's
not
our
job
to
say
what,
under
a
state
law,
harm
means,
because
that
definition
can
come
over
time,
the
way
law
generally
develops,
case
by
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
also
health
and
safety.
isn't
that...
those
cases
say
parents
decide,
but
the
state
can
regulate
to
spare
the
child
from
harm.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
48
states
that
you
claim...
it
wasn't
my
understanding
that
those
states
simply
say
best
interest,
period,
and
also
it's
not
my
reading
of
the
washington
supreme
court
decision
that
they
passed
on
the
constitutionality
of
that
other
provision
that
does
set
standards,
that
doesn't
have
just
some
broad
best
interest,
but
doesn't
set
standards
that
can
be
applied
by
judges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
there
any
state
legislature
that
has
said,
just
best
interests
without
any
guidance
at
all
about
what
comprises--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
many
are
like
washington
that
don't...
that
say
best
interests,
period,
nothing
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
a
week
in
the
summer,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
the
normal,
that
a
visitation
application
can
attend
some
other
proceedings,
divorce,
separation,
custody,
but
can't
be
made
at
any
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
is
an
assumption
that
the
washington
supreme
court
was
talking
about
a
fit
parent
who
has
custody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
of
course,
these
children
have
a
father
now.
the
mother's
husband
adopted--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
earlier,
raising
of
the...
are
you
suggesting
that
the
grandparents
accede
to
the
rights
that
the
dead
father
would
have
had,
even
though
we're
dealing
with
an
adoptive
parent,
not
a
step
parent?
