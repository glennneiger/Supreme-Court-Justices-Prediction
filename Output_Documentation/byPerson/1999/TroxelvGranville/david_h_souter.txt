justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
mr.
olson,
unless
you
are
prepared
to
accept
something
that
broad,
i
don't
understand
what
your
position
is
in
this
court,
because
as
i
understand
it
you
are
not
here
and
you
are
not
in
the
courts
of
washington
claiming
a
substantive
due
process
right,
exclusive
of
the
statute,
to
have
this
visitation.
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
claiming
a
statutory
right.
the
courts
of
washington
have
said
that
the
statute
is
too
broad,
and
they
have
declared
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional,
and
they
have
said,
we're
not
going
to
narrow
or
sever,
and
i
presume
that's
their
business.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that,
for
you
to
get
relief
in
this
court,
we
would
have
to
hold
that
in
every
possible
or
reasonably
possible
application
of
that
statute
it
was
constitutional,
because
unless
we
hold
that,
washington
was
perfectly
proper
in
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional,
and
if
you,
representing
grandparents,
want
to
come
into
court
and
claim
rights,
you've
either
got
to
get
a
new
statute,
or
you've
got
to
claim
a
constitutional
right
of
your
own,
which
you're
not
doing.
am
i
missing
something
in
the
posture
of
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
mentioned
that,
but
it
also
mentioned
the
breadth
of
the
statute.
it
said
this
statute,
in
effect,
gives
third
party
rights
to
the
world.
that's
number
1,
and
number
2,
it
does
so
on
the
basis
of
an
improper
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
we
are
in
a
position
to
resurrect
the
statute,
you
really
don't
have
a
claim
to
make
under
the
law
of
washington,
and
you're
not
making
an
independent
constitutional
claim
of
your
own.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
complex,
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
do
you
believe
that
any
person
walking
in
off
the
street,
without
any
relationship
by
blood
or
marriage
to
the
child,
may,
as
against
the
parents'
claim
of
the
right
to
control
the
upbringing
of
their
children,
get
a
court
order
based
simply
on
a
best
interests
of
the
child
standard?
do
you
believe
that
anyone
walking
in
off
the
street
may
do
that,
as
against
the
parents'
constitutional
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
my
question.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
read
its
statute
as
saying
just
what
i...
my
question
assumed.
justice
david
h.
souter
anybody
can
make
a
claim
under
the
statute.
do
you
believe
that
anyone,
as
against
the
parental
claim
of
a
constitutional
right
to
control
the
upbringing
of
their
children,
is...
may
constitutionally
get
a...
an
order
for
visitation
or
some
interference
with
parental
rights
solely
on
a
best
interests
of
the
child
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
now
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
suppose--
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
refer
to
the
48
statutes,
were
you
referring
to
the
48
statutes
that
give
rights
to
the
whole
world,
or
48
statutes
that
give
rights
to
grandparents?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
olson,
let's
assume
that
this
court
at
least
agreed
with
you
to
some
extent
and
said
yes,
given
the
special
relationship
that
grandparents
may
normally
establish
with
their
children,
some
heightened
standard
less
than
the
harm
that
might
be
necessary
for
the
state
to
move
in
would
suffice
to
justify
overcoming
the
parents'
constitutional
claim
of
their
rights
to
bring
up
the
children
without
interference.
let's
assume
that
we
held
that
was
the
law.
wouldn't
you
be
faced
with
this,
nonetheless.
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
state
of
washington,
and
the
washington
supreme
court
would
say,
well,
we
certainly
accept
the
u.s.
supreme
court's
view
of
the
limitations
on
the
parental
federal
constitutional
rights.
we
accept
that,
of
course.
however,
we
don't
have
a
statute
here
any
more.
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
it's
unconstitutional
regardless
of
its
application
to
grandparents.
it's
unconstitutional
because,
as
we
have
already
explained,
its
great
breadth
and
its
low
statutory
standard
with
respect
to
other
third
parties,
and
therefore
what
we've
got
is
a
very
interesting
statement
from
the
supreme
court
on
what
the
law
is.
but
you
have
come
into
court,
grandparents,
with
a
statutory
claim,
and
we
have
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
of
its
many
unconstitutional
applications
regardless
of
its
application
to
you.
therefore,
we
can't
give
you
any
relief.
would
that
happen
if
the
case
went
back
to
washington,
or
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the
supreme
court
of
washington
entitled
to
decide
how
broad
an
attack
on
its
own
statute
it
will
allow?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
have
to
apply
that?
that's
the
standard
that
we
apply,
or
it
may
be
the
standard
that
we
apply--
[laughter]
--in
federal
constitutional
challenges
to
federal
statutes,
but
if
washington
as
a
matter
of
state
law
wants
to
entertain
broader
challenges,
and
if
washington,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
says
we
don't
have
to
narrow
our
statutes
in
order
to
try
to
save
them,
isn't
that,
or
are
not
each
of
those
decisions
perfectly
within
the
competence
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
those
two
decisions
are
within
the
competence
of
the
state
of
washington,
then
we
could
send
this
case
back
with
a
ruling
on
grandparents
and
there
still
wouldn't
be
any
washington
statute,
and
you'd
still
lose
in
washington,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
custody
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
the
statute...
may
i
interrupt
you?
would
the
statute
apply
in
a
case
in
which
the
child
had
been
brought
up
by
one
single
parent,
let's
say
the
mother,
who
at
all
times
during
the
child's
upbringing
was
living
with
her
own
mother
and
father,
and
a
question
then
arose
as
between,
let's
say,
her
mother,
who
had
always
been
with
the
child
just
as
much
as
she
had.
would
the
statute
apply
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
the
day
comes
that
she
moves
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me,
but
before
you
get
to
that,
would
the...
would
this
statute
apply
in
that
case?
i
assumed
it
would,
frankly?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
mother,
after
10
years
living
with
the
child
with
her
own
mother,
the
child's
mother
takes
the
child
and
moves
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
her
own
mother
wants
some
visitation.
the
statute
would
apply
in
that
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
earlier
i
thought
you
said
that
the
best
interest
standard
determined
the
appropriate
circumstances
for
a
best
interest
standard,
which
you
admit
in
some
narrower
range,
turned
not
on
the
blood
relationship
but
between,
in
effect,
the
functional
relationship,
whether
or
not
there
was
the
kind
of
intimate
association
which
is
normally
associated
with
parents,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
in
my
hypo
there
would
have
been
that
extended
intimate
association,
and
that
therefore,
in
my
hypo
the
best
interest
standard,
on
your
own
reasoning,
would
be
constitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
there
is
a
blood
component
to
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
my
case,
then,
in
which
the
grandmother
has
had
just
as
intimate
a
relationship
with
the
child
as
the
child's
own
mother?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
like
the
hypo.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
she
went
to
work
every
day,
and
she
left
the
child
with
the
grandmother.
is
that
a
sufficiently
intimate
relationship
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
say
the
statute
would
be
irrelevant
in
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
say
the
statute
was
irrelevant,
but
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
would
say
it
was
irrelevant.
i
mean,
that's
not...
what...
your
concept
of
parent
as
having
the
two
factors
does
not
seem
to
be
the
concept
of
the
statute.
it
certainly
isn't
defined
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
--they
didn't
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
standard
they
were
applying.
