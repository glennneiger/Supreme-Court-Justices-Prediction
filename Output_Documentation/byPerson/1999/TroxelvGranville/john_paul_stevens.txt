justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
question,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
mean
to
get
into
this
argument
between
the
two
of
you.
i
don't
know
if
there
was
a
question
or
not.
[laughter]
but
i
did
have
this
question
for
you.
as
i
understand,
one
of
the
problems
with
this
statute
is
anybody's
standing,
but
is
it
not
true
that
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
out
there
that
give
grandparents
standing,
and
relatives,
and
i'd
just
like
to
ask
you,
what
is
the
standard
that
is
applied
in
most
of
the
statutes
throughout
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
we
were
to
invalidate
this
statute
on
the
grounds
suggested
in
the
questioning,
we'd
probably
invalidate
48
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
that
standard
there
would
be
no
relief
for
a
grandparent
even
if
the
visitation
order
was
20
minutes
every
6
months.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
acknowledge
those
presumptions
but
do
not
have
a
requirement
of
showing
harm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
those
statutes
acknowledge
all
those
presumptions
and
say
there's
a
presumption
that
the
parents
are
the
final
say
on
what
goes
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
used
in
a
dispute
between
the
two
parents
in
a
divorce
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
divorce
situation
do
you
think
it
was
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
a
problem
that
concerns
me?
i'm
just
really
interested
in
your
answer.
take
justice
souter's
hypothetical
and
assume
that...
we
see
in
domestic
relations
fights
sometimes
children
are
used
by
one
spouse
against
the
other
as
part
of
the
bargaining
and
so
forth,
and
supposing
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
mother
of
the
child
gets
into
a
dispute
with
the
grandmother
that's
totally
unrelated
to
the
welfare
of
the
child,
but
decides
for
arbitrary
reasons
to
deny
visitation
rights
because
it
will
further
her
ability
to
pursue
whatever
the
dispute
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--arbitrary
in
the
sense
of
best
interests
of
the
child,
but
yet
using
the
child
as
a
weapon
in
a
dispute
like
that.
i
take
it
your
standard
would
say,
total
control
in
the
mother?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
evidence
of
harm,
except
the
grandmother
just
won't
get
to
see
the
child
she's
been
living
with
for
the
last
20
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
10
years.
she'd
be
too
old.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
10
years.
leave
it
at
10
years.
but
that
is
the
consequence,
that
it's
an
absolute
veto
unless
the
other
side
can
prove
harm
to
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
this
case
you
appealed
to
the
appellate
court
and
the
state
court.
did
you
argue,
in
addition
to
arguing
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
that
the
trial
judge
had
engaged
in
too
much
micromanaging?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course,
if
they'd
accepted
that
argument,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
