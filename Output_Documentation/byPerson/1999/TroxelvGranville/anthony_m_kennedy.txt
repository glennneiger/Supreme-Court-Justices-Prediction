justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
argue
that
best
interest
of
the
child
like,
not
being...
that
the
child
is
harmed
if
his
best
interests
are
not
being
served,
so
that
it's
just
really
the
flip
side?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
have
answered
justice
breyer
by
saying
that
where
custody
is
in
issue,
best
interest
then
becomes
the
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
where
visitation
is
an
issue,
it
is
not,
or
do
you
make
that
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
are
you
saying
that
all
we
need
to
decide
here
is
that
that
right
applies
when
custody
is
conceded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
in
a
case
something
like
this,
where
the
initial
position
of
each
side
is
rejected,
then
the
court
makes
some
solomon
like
midway
compromise,
in
a
case
like
that,
would
the
parents...
assume
younger
parents
faced
with
well
financed
grandparents...
ever
be
entitled
to
100
percent
of
their
attorneys'
fees,
or
do
you
have
to
be
a
prevailing
party?
how
does
the
attorneys'
fees--
