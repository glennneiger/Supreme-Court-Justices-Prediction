mr.
mark
d.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
present
two
questions
today,
and
the
advance
of
theory
for
the
resolution
of
the
case
before
this
court.
the
first
question
is,
was
the
washington
state
supreme
court
correct
when
it
held
that
a
visitation
order
to
a
person
other
than
a
parent
may
not
be
granted
absent
a
showing
of
physical
or
mental
harm
to
the
child,
and
the
other
question
is,
should
the
court
at
this
time
resolve
all
of
the
constitutional
questions
that
could
be
raised
by
any
other
orders,
other
than
the
troxel
order
before
this
court?
the
answer
to
those
questions
are,
we
believe,
the
court
did
not
make
the
correct
decision
below
requiring
a
greater
standard
by
a
specific
showing
of
substantial
harm
to
the
child
than
is
already
required
by
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard,
and
we
also
ask
this
court
to
leave
for
another
day
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
questions
that
may
be
raised
by
other
visitation
orders
not
before
the
court.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
the
term
harm
is
fuzzy.
there...
that
is
a
problem.
is
it...
and
i
agree,
is
it
a
little
bit
of
harm?
is
it
a
great
deal
of
harm?
do
we
look
for
bruises
if
visitation
isn't
ordered,
or--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--harm
to
the
child.
it
is
difficult
to
put
one's
finger
on
what
harm
is.
best
interest
of
the
child
standard
subsumes
many
factors
that
the
court
considers.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
we
believe
that
the
rule
of
the
washington
supreme
court
requires
a
greater
harm,
a
more
specific
showing,
although
that
term
is
fuzzy,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
but
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard,
there
is
harm
considered
to
the
child
whether
visitation
is
ordered
or
not
ordered.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
that
harm
and
the
best
interests--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--standard
were
exclusive?
mr.
mark
d.
olson
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
our
concern
is
that
the
focus
of
the
best
interests
of
the
harm
standard
would
over
emphasize
that
and
create
a
hurdle
that
would
be
greater,
or
higher,
or
more
difficult
to
prove
and
would,
particularly
in
the
case
that
is
before
this
court,
would
effectively
bar
visitation
for
the
troxels--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--when
it's
very
slight.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
and
that
is
why
the
theory
that
we
advance
to
the
court
is
that
the
magnitude
of
the
intrusion
be
balanced
against
the
constitutionally
required
justification,
and
in
this
case
we
believe
that
best
interests
of
the
child
is
sufficient
for
the
order,
because
the
intrusion
in
our
case
is
slight.
it's
just
25.5
hours
a
month
with
the
grandparents,
and
we
believe
that
it
is
a
state
issue.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
i'm
not
certain
of
the
question
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state
courts,
as
justice
ginsburg
asked,
does
set
forth
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard
that
the
trial
court
would
then
apply
in
any
given
case.
the
intrusion
in
our
case,
in
the
troxel
matter,
is
very
slight.
there's
no
constitutional
infringement
upon
any
religious
belief,
right
to
educate,
or
any
other
matter.
it
is
simply
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
as
was
stipulated
at
the
trial
court
by
the
experts
and
by
the
mother.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
yes.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
the
line
of
cases
held
that
any
parental
decision
is
not
above
government
regulation,
but
a
parental
decision
would
be
subject...
i'm
sorry.
state
regulation
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
of
a
parental
decision
in
the
area
of
religion
or
first
amendment,
if
i
understand
the
question,
but
in
this
case
it
is
not.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
that
is
true.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
the
magnitude
of
the
intrusion
would
be
balanced
against
the--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--well,
our--
[laughter]
our
theory,
justice
scalia,
is
that
all
those
other
hypotheticals
would
be
left
for
the
state
courts
to
work
out
as
those
instances
arise,
and--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--regarding
the
expense,
your
honor,
there
are
two
statutes
in
washington
that
allow
the
court
to
award
attorneys'
fees
on
the
basis
of
need
and
ability
to
pay,
and
that
if
there
is
any
economic
imbalance
the
court
can
address
that.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
justice--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--justice--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--yes.
the
attorneys'
fees
could
be
reimbursed
if
there
was...
if
there
was
an
imbalance,
or
intransigence.
there
are
a
number
of
bases
by
which
the
court
could
address
any
complaints
regarding--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
standard
is
what
controls,
not
the
any
person
language.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
your
honor,
of
course
that's
not
the
record
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--well,
the
state
court
didn't
strike
down
the
statute
because
it
was
too
broad.
what
the
state
court
did
was,
it
struck
down
the
statute
because
it
said
that
there
was
a
requirement
of
a
substantial
physical
and
mental
harm
to
the
child.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
i
don't
believe--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--there
are
three
responses
i
have,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
the
any
person
language
admits
that
family
law
is
complex,
and
the
nature
of
families
is
so
varied
that
it's
impossible
for
us
to--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--your
honor,
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
to
the
court
and
in
the
appendix
show
that
it
is
normally
deceased
parent...
grandparents
of
deceased
parents--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard
does
restrict
who
may
petition,
and
the
any
person
language
addresses
those
people
who
have
relationships
with
the
child
or
who
has
some
meaningful
reason--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--the
only
claim
by
the
mother
was
that
it
was
her
decision,
and
there
were
no
other
constitutional
issues
raised
by
her
at
trial
or
anywhere
in
the
court.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
that
would
extend
the
line
of
cases
in
yoder
to
give
constitutional
weight
to
any
decision
of
a
parent,
in
that
they
could
go
to
school--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--well--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--whether
the
parents
be
able
to
go
to
school
and
dictate
what
ideas
or
people
who
are
associated--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--in
public
schools--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
two
questions
there.
the
common
law
question
is
in
our
footnote,
i
believe
it's
45,
roberts
v.
ward
from
new
hampshire,
and
many
other
cases
held
that
it
was
common
law
to
grant
that
visitation
right,
and
your
other
question
was--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--to
a
person
other
than
a
parent,
to
a
grandparent.
there
were
common
law
cases
cited--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--well,
the
courts
do
look
at
many
factors
under
the
best
interest
of
the
child
standard
as
well
as
the
fact
that
in
some
cases
the
parents
themselves
are
responsible
for
creating
the
relationships
that
now
the
child
requires,
and
the
child
does,
we
assert,
have
some
constitutional
claim
here,
and
the
court
should
balance
all
the
interests
involved,
not
just
the
parents.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
it's
the
welfare
of
the
children
that
the
state
is
interested
in.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
in
48
states,
the
standard
is
best
interests
of
the
child
and
no
substantial
harm,
physical
or
mental,
is
required
to
be
shown.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
48
states,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
there
are
approximately
four
statutes
that
include
the
provision,
any
person.
the
other
statutes
do
attempt
to
limit
to
siblings
or
step
parents
or
grandparents.
what
our
statute
does
is,
it
admits
that
we
are
unable
to
foresee
how
relationships
may
be
generated
between
children
and
significant
adults.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
the
special
nature
involved
in
our
case
is
that
the
children's
father,
brad
troxel,
is
deceased.
the
children
had
a
2-year
relationship
with
the
grandparents,
staying
in
the
grandparents'
home
every
other
weekend,
and
there
was
a
substantial
relationship
from
the
ages
of
1
and
3
until
the
action
was
filed
and
the
children
were
3
and
5
years
of
age.
there
is
that
relationship.
there
is
the
requirement,
we
hope,
that
the
memory
of
the
children's
father
will
be
preserved
in
the...
by
the
grandparents,
and
that
the
growth
of
the
children
will
be
enhanced
by
knowing
the
kinship
in
the
family,
where
they
come
from,
and
that
is
a
very,
very
significant
interest
for
the
state
to
have
in
terms
of
how
our
children
develop
and
what
occurs
with
regard
to
their
growth.
in
terms
of
the
harm
question,
justice
o'connor,
when
children
are
taken
away,
or
where
there's
significant
grief
or
loss,
a
lot
of
time
that
pain
goes
deep
within.
it
will
not
resurface
until
the
children
are
older,
and
there
is
loss
of
adult
relationships--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--well,
they
created
a
higher
standard
of
harm
that
will
be
then
applied
to
grandparent
visitation
cases,
of
which
they
are
more
numerous
than
these
stranger
cases,
which
have
not
been
shown
to
exist,
but
the
higher
standard
will
be
applied
to
cases
where
the
intrusion
is
slight.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
i
do
not
believe
it
did.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
i
believe
that
the
standard
that
they
used
is
not
defined.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
and
that's
why
our
theory
is
that
we
leave
for
another
day
the
difficult
cases
that
the
court
is
raising
and
resolve
this
case.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
you
mean,
if
that
were
the
standard
to
be--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--that
could
be
a
standard.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
adopt
that
standard
for
resolution
of
this
case,
because
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard
was
sufficient
under
our
theory
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
no.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
substantial
relationship,
and
there
would
be
evidence
of
harm.
however,
the
appellate
court
and
the
supreme
court
never
got
to
that
question
because
we
never
developed
it,
and
at
the
trial
court
it
was
stipulated
that
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
children
to
visit
their
grandparents.
the
only
question
before
the
trial
court
was
what
was
the
duration
of
the
harm.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
well,
most
of
the
states
state
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
is
the
touchstone,
and
that
other
factors
may
be
considered,
and
it
is
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard
including
but
not
limited
to
the
following
factors.
in
family
law
cases,
because
they're
so
complex,
the
facts
and
circumstances
dictate
the
factors
that
we
consider
in
a
trial,
and
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--some
states
set
forth
factors
as
guidance.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
i
would
have
to
look
closer
at
that.
kentucky
has
an
any
person
statute,
as
does
connecticut,
and
washington
and
california.
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
any
standards
or
factors
set
forth
in
those
statutes,
i'd
have
to
look
at
that
again.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
if
i
understand
your
question
that
would,
i
believe,
be
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
that
shows
that
it--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--it
would
need
to
apply
the
standard
that
no
case
exists
under
which
the
statute--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--it
may
be,
your
honor.
we
would
argue
again
that--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--well,
that
may
be.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
breyer,
what
i
think
is
most
important
about
the
special
question
that
you
asked
is
that
the
father
in
this
case,
brad
troxel,
wanted
the
grandchildren
to
know
their
grandparents,
and
the
state
can
continue
to
respect
his
views
before
he
died,
and
justice
souter--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--it's
a
step
parent
adoption,
and
28
states
permit
visitation
in
stepparents
adoption
cases.
justice
souter,
your
question,
we
don't
read
the
washington
opinion
to
establish
a
different
standard
for
facial
invalidity,
and
no
party
argued
for
a
different
standard
in
the
state
court,
and
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--it
was
not
discussed.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard
in
the
amended
statute
in
washington,
26.09.240,
still
is
the
basic
best
interest
standard
that
exists
in
48
states.
it
just
says,
include
and
consider
these
factors,
but
you're
not
limited
to
it,
because
the
complex
nature
of
state
dissolution
and
family
law
cases
dictates
the
factors.
we
don't
want
to
create
an
internal
revenue
code
to
try
to
figure
out
how
to
ferret
out
these
problems.
on
the
micromanagement,
it's
important
to
know
that,
regarding
the
use
of
the
name,
isabel,
it
was
the
mother's
request
that
the
grandparents
not
call
her
rose,
to
which
the
grandparents
conceded.
that
was
put
in
the
order.
all
of
the
micromanagement
issues
were
requested
by
the
parents.
the
grandparents
conceded
that,
and
that
was
to
make
the
parents
feel
better
so
that
that
would
be
better
for
the
children.
the--
mr.
mark
d.
olson
--the
problem
with
kinship,
i
believe,
is
that
we
can't
ignore
that
the
children
had
another
parent,
and
that
we
want
to
respect
the
rights
of
that
parent.
mr.
mark
d.
olson
thank
you.
