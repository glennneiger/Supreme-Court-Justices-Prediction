ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
do
so
immediately.
i
believe
that
this
visitation
order
in
this
case
was
unconstitutional.
the
order
provided
for
one
weekend
a
month
from
4:30
saturday
until
6:00
p.m.
on
sunday.
it
also
provided
for
notification
provisions
regarding
the
girls'
activities
to
the
grandparents,
for
what
amounted
to
a
court
ordered
birthday
party
on
the
grandparents'
birthdays,
and
it
also
provided
how
the
parties
would
address
the
children,
or
one
of
the
children,
in
which
there
was
a
dispute.
the
order
violated--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--address.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
address.
the--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--yes,
that's
true.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
there
was
a
week
in
the
summer,
also.
the
order
violated
the
mother's
rights
to
make
these
decisions
absent
evidence
that
the
children
were
being
harmed,
and
justice
o'connor,
in
response
to
your
question
about
what
constitutes
harm,
in
fact
the
washington
courts
have
been
working
on
these
issues
for
many
years.
they
have
addressed
harm
in
other
circumstances.
in
the
case
in
re
sumey,
which
is
in
the
briefs,
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
they
protect
the
physical
and
mental
health
of
children.
this
court
has
also
talked
about
the
fact
that
the
state
can
only
come
in
under
circumstances
in
which
the
health
and
safety
of
children
is
being
jeopardized.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
no.
i
mean
the
supreme--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--this
supreme
court,
in
yoder,
and
in
santosky
both
the
majority
opinion
and
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
dissent
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
state
will
step
in
when
harm
to
the
child
is
being
threatened.
that
is,
in
fact,
the
proper
standard
under
our
constitution.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
decision--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--yes,
there
are.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
believe
it's
38,
but
i'm
not
exactly
sure
on
the
count.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
no,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
no.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
because
first
of
all
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
a
grandparent
visitation
statute
could
be
enacted,
and
in
many
of
those
states--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--no.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
if
they
rely
on
a
strict
best
interest
standard,
without
creating
a
burden
of
proof
and
a
presumption
that
the
parent
is,
in
fact,
acting
in
a
child's
best
interests,
yes,
i
do
believe
those
statutes
unconstitutionally
impair
a
parent's
right
to
make
decisions--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--about
their
child.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
the
question.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
believe
that
those
statutes
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
parents.
yes,
i
do.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
and
so
are
happy
ones...
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
your
honor,
in
that
circumstance
i
believe
the
court
would
be
able
to
find
harm
under
the
circumstances
that
would
allow
the
parent's
decision
to
be
overridden.
the
point
is
that
the
court
has
to
have
a
level
at
which
they
start
making
decisions,
the
state
starts
making
these
decisions
instead
of
the
parent,
and
the
best
interest
standard
alone
is
insufficient.
it's
particularly
insufficient
when
it
is
characterized,
as
it
was
in
this
statute,
and
it
was
characterized
by
this
court,
as
simply
the
state
saying
what
it
thinks
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
is,
as
opposed
to
the
parent.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
i--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--well,
i
do
make
the
distinction,
but
perhaps
in
a
slightly
different
way.
when
custody
is
at
issue
between
parents,
for
instance,
there
is
a
best
interest
standard
that
should
be
applied
between
the
parents,
because
you've
got
a
neutral
playing
field
there.
you
have
two
people
who
have--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--the
right
to
assert
the
fundamental
interest
depends
upon
the
relationship
between
the
parent
and
the
child,
or
the
person
who
is
acting
in
the
parent
relationship
with
the
child.
this
court
talked
about
the
parameters
of
this
in
moore,
for
instance,
in
which
the
grandmother
was
acting
as
the
parent
to
the
child.
it
is
the
intimate
family
relationship
between
the
parent
and
the
child
that
creates
not
only
the
right
but
the
obligation
to
make
these
decisions
for
children.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
that's...
that
is
what
we're
saying.
we
have
a
perfect--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
hope
so,
too.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
am
not
aware
of
another
circumstance
in
which
this
type
of
intrusion
occurs,
where
you
have
a
third
party
coming
into
court
and
asking
for
associational
rights
with
the
child,
essentially.
now,
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
people
want
to
have
children
do
other
things,
but
i
believe
that
the
lower
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of
looking
at
the
differences
between
deciding
whether
a
parent
is
not
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
which
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
sort
of...
i
think
it
was
justice
kennedy
who
said,
this
is
sort
of
the
flip
side
of
the
harm
analysis,
and
having
a
court
independently
substitute
its
decision
of
what's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
and
the
difference
is
this,
and
the
reason
it
is
so
important
in
domestic
relations
that
this
distinction
be
made
is
that
if
you
put
the
burden
on
someone
to
show
harm,
as
that
will
be
defined
and
as
it
has
been
defined
in
many
cases
in
washington...
and
most
particularly
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
littlefield
case
which
was
decided
2
years
ago
in
washington
and
talked
about
harm
in
a
relocation
and
travel
situation.
if
you
put
the
burden
on
an
individual
to
look
at
the
parents'
decision
and
see
whether
it
is
within
the
range
of
acceptable
decisions,
that
is
a
very
different
thing
than
telling
a
court,
as
the
courts
were
told
in
these
statutes,
you
decide
what
you
think
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
and
it's
different,
and
it's
important
for
two
different
reasons.
the
first
is,
when
judges
are
making
decisions,
when
the
state
is
making
decisions
in
a
best
interest
situation,
it's
very
much
different
than
the
sorts
of
decisions
that
most
judges
make
under
most
other
circumstances,
where
they're
deciding
whether
somebody
committed
a
crime
or
breached
a
contract.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
that's
correct.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
this
statute
does
not
provide
a
constitutional
rule
of
law
for
the
determination
of
when
a
visitation
order
is
to
be
entered.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
that's--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--that's
correct.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
in
a
custody
case...
in
a
custody
case
between
a
third
party
and
a
parent,
this
standard
would
not
be
used
in
washington,
and
it
could
not
be
used,
i
do
not
believe.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
the...
it
would
have
been
used
in
washington
between
1974
and
1987.
the
washington
legislature--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--yes,
because
you've
got
two
individuals
who
have
been
acting
as
a
parent
to
the
child,
and
they,
between
the
two
of
those...
i
mean,
you've
got
to
have
a
tie
breaker
at
that
point,
if
they're
disputing,
but
you
don't
need
to
have
a
tie
breaker
under
these
circumstances.
we've
already
got
a
tie
breaker,
and
it
is
the
fact
that
the
parent
makes
the
decision
unless
it's
putting
the
child
at
risk,
which--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--for
custody
or
visitation?
this
statute?
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
if
the
parent
was
making
a
choice
to
live
with
the
parent,
with
her
parents--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--yes.
i--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--and
then
the
day
comes
when
she
decides
to
move
out.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
now,
under
a
properly
drafted
statute
i
certainly
think
that
there
might
be
circumstances
under
which,
if
the
individual
was
completely
cut
off--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--it
could.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
the
statute
would
apply,
but
i
don't
think
it
could
be
constitutionally
applied,
because
it
doesn't
provide
a
constitutional
rule
of
law.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
the
court
makes
a...
well,
parents
may
live
with
other
individuals.
that
does
not
give
a
parent
child
relationship
to
those
individuals
with
whom
they
live.
there's
still
one--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--well,
i
don't
think
there
necessarily
has
to
be.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--your
honor,
respectfully
i
would
suggest
that
they
didn't
have
just
as
intimate
a
relationship,
because
the
decision--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--no,
it's
not
that
i
don't
like
the
hypo.
it's
just
that
i
think
that...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
exactly
why
these
people
were
living
together,
but
i
presume
it
was
because
the
parent
made
the
choice
to
live
with
her
parents.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
and
that
was
the
choice
that
she
made
for
herself
and
her
child.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
no,
not...
the
parent
is
making
the
decision
how
the
parent
child
relationship
is--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--and
who
the
child
is
going
to
associate
with.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
uh
huh.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
absent
evidence
of
harm.
absent
some
indication
that
the--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--under
a
properly--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--20
years,
i
think
the
child--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--might
be
making
the
decision.
[laughter]
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
no,
i
would
not.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
because
i
think
it's
both
the
combination
of...
well,
this
is
the
reason
i
said
i'm
not
sure
the
biological
relationship
is
the
truly
relevant
one.
it's
the
fact
that
the
parent,
by
definition,
has
the
right
and
the
obligation
to
make
day
to
day
decisions
for
the
child,
and
this
is
exactly
the
sort
of
day
to
day
decision
that
parents
rather
than
the
state
should
be
making,
and
you--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--i
think
we're
defining
parent
differently.
i'm
defining
parent
in
a
way
that
acknowledges
the
fact
that
a
parent
parents
a
child,
that--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--that's
correct.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
the
fact
that
the...
no.
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
fact
that
the
biological
parent,
who
has
not
acted
as
a
parent
to
the
child...
he
wouldn't
have
any
standing
under
this
statute.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
who's
going
to
be...
somebody's
taking
care
of
the
child,
presumably.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
the
court
had
before
it,
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
they
anticipated
a
situation...
they
had
before
it
three
fit
parents,
in
which
there
was
no
question,
and
there's
certainly
no
question
in
this
case
that
those
parents
were
fully
capable
of
making
decisions
for
the
children,
and
that
there
was...
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
those
decisions,
except
somebody
who
had
the
filing
fee
amount
disagreed
with
them.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
the
statute
that
is
now
left
in
fact
requires
that
there
be
a
court
action
pending.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
it
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
it
was
not...
and
it
would
not
have
provided
relief
to
the
grandparents
in
this
case,
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case
or
in
any
of
the
cases
that
were
before
the
state
supreme
court
because
there
was
not
a
custody
action
pending.
it
does--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
normal.
it's
certainly
the
case
in
many
jurisdictions
that
that
is
a
triggering
mechanism,
and
certainly
the
intrusion
under
circumstances
like
that
is
far
less
than
it
is
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
any
person
at
any
time
can
seek
visitation,
because
the
parties
are
already
in
court
at
that
point.
somebody's
going
to
be
making
a
decision
concerning
this.
and
when
the
washington
legislature
passed
that
statute
in
1996
they
required
not
only
that
there
be
a
custody
action
pending,
but
that
the
individual
who
is
seeking
visitation
show
a
substantial
relationship
to
the
child.
they
presumed
that
grandparents
have
such
a
relationship,
but
again,
they
required
that
there
be
a
custody
action
pending,
and
it's
the
intrusion
of
coming
into
court
that
is,
in
fact,
one
of
the
things
about
this
statute
that
is
so
pernicious.
you
should
not
be
placed
in
the
situation
that
my
client
was
placed
in
of
coming
in
and
defending
a
perfectly
reasonable
decision,
because
this
started
out
as
a
dispute
about
whether
these
grandparents,
who
were
never
denied
access,
were
going
to
see
these
children
once
a
month
or
every
other
weekend,
which
is
what
they
were
seeking.
they
wanted
every
other
weekend
overnight
visitation
with
two
girls
who
at
the
time
were
less
than
2
and
4,
and
no
one
should
be
brought
into
court
for
that
sort
of
dispute,
and
that's
what
the
washington
supreme
court
recognized
in
finding
that
the
parents
in
the
cases
before
it
had
a
statute
unconstitutionally
applied
to
them,
because
there
was
no
standard
for
either
allowing
individuals
to
come
into
court,
which
individuals,
when
they
could
come
into
court,
or
what
had
to
be
proven
in
order
for
a
visitation
order,
or
any
of
the
other
little
micromanagement
that
goes
on
in
these
sorts
of
orders,
to
be
entered.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
that's
correct,
and
that's
what
they
had
before
them,
and
in
fact
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
thought
they
were
applying
this
statute
to
these
fact
situations.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
oh,
sure.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
that...
he
would
be
denied
custody.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
believe.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
because
we
have
a
situation...
i
mean,
the
constitution,
as
it's
been
characterized
by
this
court,
or
interpreted
by
this
court,
and
as
a
matter
of
the
way
we've
operated
our
society,
we
have
parents
make
decisions
about
who
children
are
going
to
visit
with,
what
candy
they're
going
to
eat,
how
much
television
they're
going
to
eat,
and
we
don't
take
that
decision
away
from
them.
all
those
little
decisions,
the
big
decisions,
all
the
things
that
raise
children--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
with
a
number
of
factors.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
believe
that
the
court...
and
i
would
encourage
them
to,
and
i
may
get
the
opportunity
to,
to
have
them
apply
a
harm
standard.
they
did
that
in
the
littlefield
case
with
regard
to
relocation.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
i
think
what
they
recognized
is
this,
that
they
had
a
statute
that
allowed
any
person
at
any
time
to
seek
visitation,
and
at
least
with
regard
to
that
broad
a
statute,
they
believed
that
there
had
to
be
a
showing
of
harm,
and
i
think
that
it's
important
to
recognize--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--i
believe--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--it
would
have
to
be
interpreted
by
the
court.
i
believe
that--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--no.
i
think
that
the
court
could
characterize
the
best
interest
standard
as
providing
an
appropriate
protection
for
the
parents'
right,
because...
if
it
required
a
showing
that
the
parents'
decision
under
those
circumstances
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
that
would
be
the
equivalent
of
a
showing
of
harm.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well,
the
statute
has
factors
involved
in
it.
it
also
requires
that
there
already
be
the
court
intrusion.
i
don't
know,
and
they
haven't
had
that
case
before
them.
they
had
to
consider
what
they
were
going
to
do
in
situations
like
this,
where
a
third
party
was
seeking
visitation
absent
such
an
intrusion
already
occurring.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
we
wouldn't
be
here.
if
they'd
accepted
my
argument
that
they
should
apply
what
they'd
been
doing
for
20
years
with
the
state,
there
had
to
be
another
action
pending.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
you
know,
i
can
tell...
i
can
only
tell
you
what
happens
in
a
situ...
in
most
of
these
situations,
and
that
is,
in
the
course
of
the
solomonic
division,
the
courts
usually
don't
award
fees.
i
can
certainly
represent
that
to
you,
and
i
can
also
tell
you
that
in
the
two
other
cases
that
were
pending
before
the
state
supreme
court,
that
in
the
other
case
in
which
i
represented
the
parent,
that
the
court
below...
because
these
decisions
are
made
by
the
trial
courts,
who
have
just
had
themselves
reversed...
did
not
award
fees
to
a
client
who
was
in
much
worse
financial
situation
than
the
parents...
than
the
grandparents.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
i
absolutely
do,
and
i
think
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
that
it's
really
the
flip
side
of
that.
if
you...
and
this
goes
back
to
something
i
was
talking
about
earlier,
which
is
the
second
reason
the
best
interest
standard
doesn't
work,
and
that
is
that
when
you
tell
the
state
or
a
court
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
a
parent
is
not
acting
in
a
child's
best
interest,
the
focus
of
the
decision
is
much
different
than
asking
a
court--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--what
is
in
a
child's
best
interest.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
no.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
it's...
the
court
has
to
look
at
whether
the
consequences
of
the
parent's
decision
will
be
to
harm
the
child.
in
that
circumstance,
a
parent
would
not
be
acting
in
a
child's
best
interest.
it's
the
difference
between
asking
in
this
case--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--well,
best
interests
i
think
has
to
be
defined
in
a
way
that
you
recognize
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
decisions
that
could
be
made
about
a
child,
and
we
may
disagree
about
what
is
in
a...
i
might
think
that
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
my
child
to
go
out
for
football
rather
than
to
play
the
violin.
the
choice
of
the
outcome,
as
long
as
it's
not
harmful
to
the
child,
is
the
parents,
and
if
you're
making
decisions
that
go
towards
that
outcome,
then
somebody
else
shouldn't
substitute
their
decision.
if
i
think
instead
that
it
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
my
child
to
be
in
child
pornography,
then
somebody
else
can
step
in
and
say,
that
is
not
a
decision
that
can
be
in
the
child's
best
interest.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
it
is.
you're
absolutely
right,
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
from
harm,
and
the
reason
that
it
isn't
is
because
it
takes
the
focus
away
from
the
state
making
the
decision
to
whether
the
parent's
decision
is
within
the
range
of
acceptable
decisions.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
yes.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
well--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--the...
this
argument
that's
being
made
now
that
we...
there's
a
difference
between--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--i'm
sorry.
no.
what
i
asked
the
court
to
do...
first
of
all,
i
made
an
argument
that
they
should
rely
on
our
state
constitution,
which
they
didn't
address.
then
i
asked
the
court
to
construe
the
statute
narrowly
so
that
it
could
be
properly
applied,
and
that
under
the
facts
of
these
cases
these
people
could
not
seek
the--
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
--the
court
thought
that
the
statute
violated
the
federal
constitution.
ms.
catherine
w.
smith
thank
you.
