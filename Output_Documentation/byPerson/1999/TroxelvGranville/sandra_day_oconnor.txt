o'connor
mr.
olson,
it's
not
clear
to
me
just
what
the
washington
court
included
in
the
word
harm.
can
harm
be
stress
to
the
child
because
of
the
severance
of
a
substantial
relationship?
is
that
harm?
i...
it's
not
clear
to
me
how
we
even
define
the
term.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
surely
must
mean
more
than
physical
harm,
but
what
other
things
fall
within
it,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
really
think
that
the
state
can
have
a
statute
as
broad
as
this
that
says,
any
person
at
any
time
can
march
in
and
ask
a
court
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
order
some
kind
of
visitation?
i
mean,
this
is
a
breathtakingly
broad
provision,
is
it
not,
and
it's
very
expensive
for
parents
to
defend
lawsuits
if
anybody
can
walk
in
at
any
time
and
file
a
court
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
get
back
to
my
question
of
the
breadth
of
this
statute.
do
you
defend
it,
any
person,
any
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wait
a
minute.
that
means
that
some
welfare
caseworker
can
march
into
court
and
ask
for
some
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
loss
of
a
substantial
relationship
can
constitute
harm,
in
your
view.
now,
we
don't
know
whether
the
washington
state
court
would
deem
that
as
a
possible
kind
of
harm,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
excuse
me,
i
didn't
find
where
the
washington
court
ever
defined
harm.
would
you
show
me
where
it
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
as
i
said,
we
don't
know
what
the
state
of
washington
will
do
in
interpreting
the
concept
of
harm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
the
name,
the
use
of
the
name?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
around
the
country
in
different
states
that
specifically
address
the
right
of
grandparents
to
seek
visitation
orders,
are
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
states
have
that
kind
of
legislation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
apparently,
in
your
view,
all
of
those
are
unconstitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
out.
gone.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
38
of
them.
now,
as
i
understand
your
view,
most
of
those
are
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
they
speak
in
terms
of
the
right
of
a
grandparent
to
seek
visitation
based
on
best
interest,
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
often
these
come
up
in
contexts
where
it
isn't
between
two
parents.
there
may
be
one
parent
who's
impaired
through
drug
abuse
or
something
else,
and
you
may
have
an
aunt
or
a
grandparent
who's
had
the
child
all
along,
for
years.
now,
what
standard
does
the
constitution
demand
in
a
custody
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
statute
left
in
washington
now
to
cover
visitation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
that
in
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
now
your
own
state
of
washington
has
adopted
a
new
statute
to
fill
the
gap,
hasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
again,
it
bases
it
on
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
under
the
rule
that
you
would
have
us
adopt,
that
also
is
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
your
view,
if
we
were
to
adopt
it,
this
follow
up
statute
is
also
invalid--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
its
literal
language
of
the
best
interest
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
mean
something
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--may
i
ask
you
one
last
question
here
about
what
you
urged
the
washington
court
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
ask
the
court
to
find
the
statute
then
being
used
constitutionally
overbroad,
applying
the
federal
standard
for
overbreadth--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--constitutional
overbreadth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
answer
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think,
then,
that
the
washington
supreme
court
applied
a
federal
constitutional
overbreadth
standard
in
striking
the
entire
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
section
26.10.160(3)
of
the
revised
code
of
washington
permits
any
person
to
petition
a
superior
court
at
any
time
for
the
right
to
visit
with
a
child
and
authorizes
the
court
to
grant
a
visitation
right
whenever
visitation
may
serve
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
in
this
case
the
petitioners,
jennifer
and
gary
troxel
filed
a
petition
under
the
washington
statute
for
the
right
to
visit
their
granddaughters,
the
children
of
their
deceased
son.
the
respondent,
tommie
granville,
the
mother
of
the
children,
opposed
the
petition.
granville
agreed
that
her
daughter
should
spend
some
time
with
their
grandparents,
but
opposed
the
petition,
because
she
objected
to
the
amount
of
visitation
asked
for
by
the
troxels.
the
washington
superior
court
granted
the
petition
and
entered
a
decree
ordering
visitation,
one
week
in
a
month,
one
week
during
the
summer,
four
hours
on
both
of
the
grandparents’
birthdays.
the
case
ultimately
reached
the
washington
supreme
court,
which
held
that
the
state's
visitation
statute
unconstitutionally
interferes
with
the
fundamental
right
of
parents
to
rear
their
children.
unfortunately,
the
members
of
this
court
were
no
more
able
to
reach
a
resolution
than
were
the
parties
to
the
case.
in
a
series
of
opinions
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
washington
supreme
court.
a
plurality
of
four
justices;
myself,
the
chief
justice,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
would
affirm
the
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
the
application
of
the
washington
statute
to
granville
and
her
family
violated
her
fundamental
right
to
make
decisions
concerning
the
care,
custody
and
control
of
her
children.
justice
souter,
who
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
agrees
that
the
washington
statute
violates
the
right
of
parents
to
rear
their
children
but
would
affirm
the
judgment
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
thomas
who
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
agrees
that
our
court
has
recognized
a
fundamental
right
of
parents
to
rear
their
children,
and
would
affirm
on
the
ground
that
washington
lacks
even
a
compelling
interest
in
second
guessing,
a
fit
parents’
decision
regarding
visitation
with
third
parties.
justices
stevens,
scalia
and
kennedy
had
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
