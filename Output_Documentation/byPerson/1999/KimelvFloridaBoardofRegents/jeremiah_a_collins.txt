mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
employees
of
state
agencies
who
have
been
injured
by
violations
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
are
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
from
suing
the
states
in
federal
court
for
redress,
because
congress
unequivocally
authorized
such
suits
in
the
statute,
and
congress
had
the
power
to
do
so
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
authorization
of
these
suits
is
established
by
the
incorporation
into
the
adea
of
section
16(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
that
section
specifically
provides
for
suits
by
employees
against
public
agencies,
including
the
states,
in
state
or
federal
court
and,
as
this
court
observed
last
year
in
alden,
it
provides
for
those
suits
without
regard
for
consent.
by
incorporating
this
provision
into
the
adea,
together
with
provisions
which
state
that
claims
under
the
adea
will
be
deemed
to
be
claims
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
this
purpose,
congress
unequivocally
authorized
these
suits
and
abrogated
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
don't
have
the
number,
justice
o'connor.
the
statute,
of
course
in
seminole
tribe
did
not
refer
to
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
the
statute
in
union
gas
didn't
refer
to
the
eleventh
amendment
or
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
court
held
in
both
of
those
cases
that
the
intent
was
clear
to
abrogate.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
and
that
was
true
in
missouri
employees
as
well,
your
honor,
under
the
flsa,
but
here
congress
has
gone
further,
as
the
court
observed
in
alden,
and
clearer,
in
that
it
refers
among
other
things
to
courts
state
or
federal,
and
to
suits
against
any
employer,
including
a
public
agency.
and
we
also
know,
not
merely
from
legislative
history
but
from
the
retroactivity
provision
of
the
1974
amendments
to
section
16(b),
that
congress
amended
section
16(b)
into
its
present
form
for
the
specific
purpose
of
providing
the
clear
statement
of
intent
to
abrogate
that
the
court
had
found
lacking
in
missouri
employees.
so
in
these...
in
this
situation
the
specific
phrasing
referring
to
public
agencies,
state
or
federal
courts,
combined
with
the
retroactivity
provision
making
it
unambiguous
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
provide
an
abrogation
as
to
suits
against
states
in
federal
court,
we
believe
is
unequivocally
clear.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the...
of
course,
competent
jurisdiction
is
a
phrase
used
in
many
statutes.
if
it
weren't
used,
a
person
conceivably
could
sue
in
an
appellate
court,
sue
in
a
small
claims
court,
but
this
court
held
in
wisconsin
department
of
correction
v.
schacht
that
the
fact
that
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity
could
be
available
in
a
particular
case
does
not
mean
that
the
federal
court
lacks
jurisdiction
over
that
case,
lacks
original
jurisdiction.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
phrase,
competent
jurisdiction,
cannot
properly
be
construed
as
importing
defenses
of
consent
or
lack
of
consent,
immunity
defenses.
i
think
schacht
is
clear
on
that,
and
again,
it
is
quite
clear,
i
think
not
only
from
alden
but
from
the
retroactivity
provision
of
the
'74
amendments
that
we
have
here
a
statute
that's
unusually
explicit
in
being
designed
to
provide
the
statement
of
clear
intent
that
the
court
upheld
in
missouri
to
have
been
missing
from
the
flsa
prior
to
the
'74
amendments.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
no,
it
does
not,
and
i
believe
that
there
are
numerous
others
that
do
not
make
a
specific
reference.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that's
correct.
now,
congress
had
the
power
to
abrogate
state
immunity
from
claims
under
this
statute
because
this
is
a
statute
aimed
at
arbitrary
discrimination
against
a
class
of
people
based
on
stereotypes
about
that
class.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
it
does,
justice
o'connor,
and
it
certainly
goes
beyond
what
the
courts
acting
without
congressional
guidance
could
find
to
be
unconstitutional,
but
it
does
so,
as
i'll
undertake
to
explain,
in
a
way
that's
congruent,
to
use
this
court's
terms,
with
the
constitutional
prohibition.
and
the
heart
of
the
statute,
the
core,
the
reason
it
was
enacted,
and
the
purpose
that
is
served
by
its
various
provisions,
is
to
get
at
a
form
of
what
this
court
has
called
invidious
discrimination
in
mckennon--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
justice--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
would
say
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
even
in
1967,
in
the
years
leading
up
to
the
initial
enactment,
what
congress
was
looking
at,
and
what
the
labor
department,
for
example,
studied
in
the
reports
it
gave
to
congress,
was
the
general
approach
that
employers
of
all
sorts
took
to
decisionmaking
based
on
age,
and
the
labor
department
surveys,
for
example,
did
include
public
agencies.
many...
there
were...
congressmen
referred
to
public
agencies
along
with
private
employers
in
'67,
and
what
congress
was
finding
in
1967,
based
on
the
information
it
was
receiving,
was
essentially
a
pervasive
problem
in
our
society
of
how
people
look
at
older
workers.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
no,
congress
is
not
changing
constitutional
law,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
murgia
the
court
did
not
say
that
there
could
never
be
unconstitutional
or
invidious
discrimination
based
on--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
would
not...
not
a
stereotype
of
the
sort
that
congress
was
concerned
with
in
the
statute.
it
approved
a
generalization,
but
what
congress--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
i
would
say
the
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
congress--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--one
can
make
a
generalization
regarding
any
classification
which
is
for
the
most
part
true
but
will
have
certain
exceptions,
and
which
is
essentially
grounded
in
a
rational
determination.
one
can
have
a
stereotype,
which
is
what
congress
found
to
be
happening
with
regard
to
age,
where
one
has
a
generalization
that
first
of
all
is
not
accurate
even
on
the
average,
which
is
what
congress...
what
the
labor
department
determined
and
what
congress
accepted,
and
which
reflects
not
a
rational
assessment
of
qualifications,
but
a
prejudice,
an
unfounded
prejudice.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
at
least--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--justice
scalia,
the
judgment
congress
made
is
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
anything
reflected
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
what
the
court
had
said
in
murgia
and
vance
and
gregory
was
not
that
age
in
general,
or
certainly
not
always,
is
a
rational
basis
for
decisions.
the
court
in
those
cases
looked
at
the
particular
jobs
in
question,
looked
particularly
in
gregory
at
the
difficulty,
in
the
circumstances,
of
making
individual
judgments,
and
found
a
rational
basis
under
a
form
of--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that
kind
of
a
judgment
would
be
closer,
justice
scalia,
because
it
would
not
be
based
on
the
kinds
of
stigmatizing
attitudes
towards
people's
ability
that
congress
found
to
be
pervasive.
what
congress
found
to
be
the
basic
reason
that
older
workers
were
not
being
retained
were
stereotypes
about
their
qualifications,
not
economic
judgments
of
the
nature
of--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--but--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--but
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
two
points
are
crucial
about
murgia
and
vance
and
gregory.
first,
the
court
emphasized
the
nature
and
in
some
instances
the
evidence
about
the
particular
jobs
that
made
it
rational
to
conclude
there
was
a
significant
problem
of
inability
of
older
workers,
and
an
impossibility
of
making
individual
determinations.
and
secondly,
and
equally
important,
the
court
emphasized
that
it
was
applying
a
mode
of
review
that
applies
when
the
courts
are
acting
without
congressional
guidance.
as
the
court
said
in
cleburne,
standards
of
review
are
rules
the
courts
devise
when
congress
has
not
spoken,
and
that
were
being
applied
to
legislative
judgments
where
the
legislators
don't...
can't
be
called
into
court
to
explain
all
their
reasons.
the
court
in
fact
emphasized
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
limited
role
the
courts
play
in
reviewing
age-based
classifications
is
that
age
is
a
matter
that
the
political
process
can
deal
with.
it's
not
a
discrete
and
insular
minority,
and
congress--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
don't
believe
that's
what's
been
done
here.
the
basic
constitutional
law
here
is
that
you
cannot
use
arbitrary
classifications
where
they
are
too
attenuated.
this
court
has
said,
for
example,
property
ownership,
it's
not
a
suspect
classification,
but
the
court
held
unanimously
in
1989
that
it
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
to
deny
certain
government
positions
to
people
because
they
didn't
own
property.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
it
didn't
go
quite
that
far,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
actually
it
established
a
scheme
which
is
more
proportional
to
the
equal
protection
clause
core
than
in
the
voting
rights
cases,
for
example,
because
what
congress
did,
it
recognized,
it
learned
from
the
labor
department
that
there
are
some
instances
when
employers
rely
on
age
in
a
noninvidious,
rational
way.
one
area
was
benefits.
another
was
where
an
employer
can
show
that
some
older
workers,
because
of
their
age,
are
unable
to
perform
satisfactorily,
and
it's
not
practical
to
make
individual
determinations,
as
was
the
situation
in
gregory,
for
example,
as
the
court
emphasized.
sometimes
you
can't.
congress
allows
reliance
on
age
in
that
circumstance.
so
what
congress
has
fashioned
here
is
a
system
of
proof
and
defenses
which,
we
submit,
is
well-calculated
to
get
at
the
arbitrary,
invidious
discrimination
that
congress
was
aiming
at.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
there's
no
reference
to
the
constitution,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
there
are
comparisons
to
title
vii
and
to
other
discrimination
statutes
which
congress
certainly
knew
had
been
passed
to
deal
with
constitutional
problems,
but
of
course--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
that
was
the
case
in
fullilove,
and
that
was
the
situation,
of
course,
in
wyoming,
where
the
court--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--not
on
the
point
that
congress'
section
5
power
could
be
considered
as
a
source
of
the
statute,
despite
the
fact
that
congress
hadn't
mentioned
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
been
overruled
in
terms
of
the
substantive
analysis
of
when
one
can
take
race
into
account
in
that
context,
but
the
lead
opinion
in
fullilove,
and
even
the
dissent,
both
said
we
will
view
this...
we
will
analyze
this
as
legislation
adopted
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
even
though
the
fact
was
congress
had
not
referred
to
that.
and
the
court
has
always
said
that
what
we
do
when
we
review
the
permissibility
of
a
congressional
enactment
is
to
look
at
what
congress
has
done
and
see,
with
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
whether
there
is
any
constitutional
power
to
support
it.
the
court
has
never
required
that
congress
identify
the
power
it's
invoking.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
but
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
congress
has
made
clear
its
judgment
as
to
the
nature
of
the
conduct
it
is
dealing
with,
and
it
made
that
clear
here
not
only
in
'67
but
in
the
'74
legislative
history
that
it
believed
it
was
dealing
with
arbitrary,
invidious
discrimination,
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
then
finish
the
sentence
and
say,
and
that
violates
the
constitution,
is
not
dispositive
as
to
congress'
possession
of
the
power
to
enact
the
statute.
