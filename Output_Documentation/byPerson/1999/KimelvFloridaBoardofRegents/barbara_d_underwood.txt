mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
age
discrimination
act
was
passed
after
congress
heard
extensive
evidence
that
employers
were
refusing
to
hire
people
over
the
age
of
40
on
the
basis
of
myths
and
stereotypes.
people
in
their
forties
and
fifties
who
lost
their
jobs
or
reentered
the
job
market
after
child-rearing
couldn't
find
new
jobs
because
of
this
prejudice.
the
legislative
findings
say
explicitly
that
older
workers
are,
quote,
disadvantaged
in
their
efforts
to
retain
employment
and
especially
to
regain
employment
when
displaced
from
jobs,
and
when
congress
extended
the
ban
on
age
discrimination
to
public
employers
in
1974,
public
employers
state
and
federal,
it
did
so
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
public
employers
were
also
engaging
in
this
arbitrary
and
irrational
discrimination.
it
had
evidence
in
the
form
of
an
extensive
report
that
had
been
done
in
the
state
of
california--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--actually,
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
evidence
before
congress
was
of
a
decision
that
was
common,
and
it
was
irrational.
it
wasn't
under
60,
justice
scalia,
it
was
under
40,
and
what
congress
found
was
that
employers
that...
there
were
studies
that
showed
that
more
than
half
the
jobs
in
the
workplace
were
closed
to
people
under
40,
or
under
45--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--and
what
they--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--and
what
congress
found
was
that
those
decisions
were
predominantly
based
on
beliefs
that
congress
also
found,
on
the
basis
of
studies,
to
be
false,
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
false--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
false--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
studies
before
congress
showed
that
in
fact
younger
employees
did
not
stay
with
companies
longer
than
people
who
joined
them
at
the
age...
in
their
forties
and
fifties.
it's
true,
justice
scalia,
that
in
principle,
if
one
were
speculating
about
the
probabilities,
one
might
suppose
that.
but
the
studies
showed
that
while
they
may
leave
for
different
reasons,
they
leave
more
often,
not
less
often
than
older
workers.
the
studies
showed
that
it's...
that
the
workers
in
the
protected
class
were
not
more
often
absent,
did
not...
were
not
less
loyal,
that
is,
did
not
move
around,
and
were
not
less
productive.
that's
the
evidence--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--they
didn't
leave
sooner.
obviously,
they
left
for
retirement
sooner
than
younger
workers
left
for
retirement,
but
younger
workers--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
what
congress
found
was
that
the
reasons
actually
used
by
employers,
namely,
the
belief
that
they
were
less
productive,
more
often
absent,
and
left
sooner,
were
false,
that
that's
what
the
studies
showed,
and
that
that's
the
belief
on
which
the
employers
were
by
and
large
acting,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
information,
congress
passed
this
law.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
there
was,
even
in
1967
when
the
law
was
passed,
evidence
before
congress
about
state
action,
although--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
by
now
they
do.
actually,
when
the
statute
was--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--when
the
statute
was
passed
in
'67,
there
were
only
a
few.
when
the
statute--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
actually
not
clear
about
the
alabama
plaintiff.
there's
a
question--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--florida
has
laws.
the
existence
of
state
laws
doesn't
suggest
that
there's
not
a
problem.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary.
it
suggests
that
the
states
recognize
that
there's
a
problem
and,
in
fact,
the
state
officials
charged
with
enforcing
the
laws
that
were
in
effect,
the
state
laws
that
were
in
effect
in
1974,
were
eager
to
have
federal
law
passed
because
they
said
they
didn't
have
the
resources
or
the
ability
to
enforce
their
laws
adequately,
so
they
didn't
feel
displaced
but,
rather,
supported
by
the
federal
effort.
and
the
fact
that
states
as
a
matter
of
policy
prohibit
age
discrimination
doesn't
mean
that
states
as
employers
don't
engage
in
it.
indeed,
the
extensive
california
study
that
was
before
congress
was
exactly
such
a
case.
it
was
a
state
with
an
employment...
with
an
age
discrimination
law,
and
yet
the
studies
that
california
had
done
established
that
age
discrimination
was
rampant
in
the
public
service
in
california,
and
that
further
legislative
efforts
and
administrative
efforts
would
be
necessary
to
do
something
about
it.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
it's
never...
it
would
be
surprising
to
think
that
the
existence
of
race
discrimination
and
sex
discrimination
law
somehow
eliminated
the
race
and
sex
discrimination
problem
and
made
it
unnecessary
even
in
public
employment,
and
made
it
unnecessary
for
a
federal
law
to
address
a
problem
either
in
the
workplace
at
large
or
in
public
employment
generally.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct,
although
the
history
of
sex
discrimination
is
a
little
bit
more
ambiguous.
that
is
to
say,
at
the
point
at
which
congress
extended
the
title
vii
to
the
states,
this
court
had
not
yet
held
that
sex
discrimination
requires
heightened
scrutiny,
and
it
still
hasn't
put
it
in
the
same
category
as
race
discrimination,
and
nevertheless,
it
is
appropriate
for
congress
to...
this
court
has
endorsed
the
proposition
that
title
vii
is
proper
legislation
even
against
the
states.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
fact
that
age
discrimination
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
kind
of
constitutional
scrutiny
as
race
discrimination
and
therefore
has
to
be
irrational
before
it's
unconstitutional,
as
distinguished
from
the
different
tests
that
would
be
applied
to
race,
doesn't
put
it
beyond
the
race,
the
reach
of
the
protection
clause
or
beyond
the
reach
of
congress.
when
this
court
analyzed
in
romer
and
in
cleburne,
this
court
was
looking
at
grounds
of
discrimination
that
are
not
entitled...
have
never
been
held
entitled
to
strict--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--or
even
heightened
scrutiny.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
congress...
what
happened
here
isn't
that
congress
identified
an
occasional
instance
of
arbitrary
use
of
age
and
provided
a
remedy.
it
found
that
there
was
widespread
use
of
a
class-based
stereotype,
that
it
also
found
was
false,
that
was
depriving
people
of
the
ability
to
make
a
living,
which
is...
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
a
fundamental
right,
but
that
it
was
having
sufficient
harmful
impact
to
warrant
federal
intervention.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
section
5
power.
that
wouldn't
involve
a
determination...
now,
if
congress
were
to
find
that
a
particular
class
on
the
basis
of
stereotypes
and
myths
about
that
class,
were
being
regularly--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
that
a...
the
kind
of
person...
class-based
judgment
based
on
personal
characteristics
have
traditionally
been
the
subject
of
persistent
discrimination
that
has
a
kind
of
impact
on
an
individ...
on
a
group--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--congress--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--congress
had
the
debate
about
the
rationality
of
the
use
of
age.
that
was
extensively
debated.
it
was
in
years
of
hearings
and
reports,
and
it
was
discussed
on
the
floor.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'd
like
to
mention--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
you've
identified
a
distinction,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
didn't
have
the
power
to
find
what
this
court
couldn't.
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
as
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
found
an
age
discrimination
unconstitutional,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
no
different
from
what
happened
with
literacy
tests
for
voting.
the
court
upheld
english
literacy
tests
as
a
reasonable
voting
requirement,
then
congress
found
that
english
literacy
tests
were
being
used
invidiously
and
prohibited
them,
and
this
court
said
congress
had
properly
used
its
fact-finding
power
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
to
the...
well,
in
fact,
this
is
stronger
than
that,
because
congress
in
19--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
no,
it's
whether...
i
think
it's...
the
parallel
is
much
stronger.
it's
whether
age
discrimination
which
could
in
principle
be
proper,
as
literacy
tests
could
in
principle
be
proper,
was
being
used
in
an
unconstitutional,
arbitrary,
and
irrational
way,
warranting
congressional
review,
warranting
a
remedy
under
the
enforcement
power
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
as
to
the
proposition
that
age
is
different
from
race
and
sex,
congress
calibrated
this
statute
to
that.
the
reason
age
was
not
put
in
the
1964
civil
rights
act
was
that
there
was
an
awareness
that
there
are
proper
uses
of
age,
that
seniority
systems
and
pension
plans
and
other
decisions
that
are
made
in
the
workforce
are
properly
calibrated
to
age,
but
there
are
also
irrational
and
arbitrary
ones,
and
so
a
separate
study
was
commissioned
and
a
separate
statute
was
written
to
deal
with
precisely
that
problem,
to
tailor
the
remedy
to
the
constitutional
violation
that
congress
perceived.
as
to
mr.
sutton's
observation
that
there
is
no
predicate
for
this,
there
wasn't
then
and
there
isn't
now
in
the
world,
mr.
sutton
is
right
to
focus
on
individual
decisions
of
state
employers.
that
is
what
the
act
is
largely
aimed
at
today
in
view
of
the
demise
of
mandatory
retirement,
but
the
reported
cases
under
state
and
federal
statutes
do
show
examples
of
irration...
the
same
kind
of
irrational,
unconstitutional,
arbitrary
age
discrimination
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
situations
of
employers
essentially
harassing
and
insulting
an
older
worker
because
of
his
age,
situations
where
a
reduction
in
force
was
required
and
the
employer
simply
went
down
the
age
list
and
reduced
from
the
top
down,
and
the
allegation
in
this
case
is
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
would
say
that
congress...
that
it
was
irrational
under
our
jurisprudence
if
it
was
based
on
the
belief...
false
beliefs,
as
congress
found
that
these
decisions
were.
