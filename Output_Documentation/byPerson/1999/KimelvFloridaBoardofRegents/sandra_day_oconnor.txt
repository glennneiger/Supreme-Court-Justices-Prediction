justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
1967,
congress
passed
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
the
act
makes
it
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
on
the
basis
of
age.
although,
the
act
originally
applied
only
to
private
employers,
in
1974,
congress
extended
the
act
to
state
and
local
government
employers.
in
these
cases,
before
the
court,
three
sets
of
plaintiffs,
employees
of
the
state
filed
suit
under
the
act
in
federal
court
seeking
money
damages
from
their
state
employers
based
on
alleged
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age.
in
each
case
the
state
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
basis
of
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court.
in
one
case
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss,
but
in
the
remaining
cases
the
district
court
denied
the
motions.
appeals
in
all
three
cases
were
consolidated
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
a
divided
opinion
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
does
not
abrogate
the
state’s
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
congress
did
clearly
state
its
intention
to
abrogate
the
state’s
sovereign
immunity.
the
act
states
that
its
requirement
shall
be
enforced
not
only
through
its
own
remedial
provisions
but
also
through
certain
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
one
of
those
provisions
that
congress
incorporated
into
that
adea
authorizes
employees
to
bring
law
suits
for
money
damages
against
state
governments
and
both
federal
and
state
court.
together,
we
think
those
provisions
do
sufficiently
indicate
congress’
intent
to
abrogate
the
state’s
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
nevertheless,
we
conclude
that
in
stripping
the
states
of
their
sovereign
immunity,
congress
succeeded
its
constitutional
authority.
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
is
not
appropriate
legislation
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first,
the
act
imposes
burdens
on
state
and
local
governments
that
are
disproportionate
to
any
unconstitutional
conduct
that
conceivably
could
be
targeted
by
the
act.
because
age
is
not
a
suspect
classification
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
states
may
take
action
on
the
basis
of
age
without
offending
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
long
as
the
classification
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
rationality
mandated
by
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
states
to
match
age
distinctions
and
the
legitimate
interest
they
serve
with
razorlike
precision.
rather
states
may
validly
rely
on
age
as
a
proxy
for
individuals,
abilities
or
characteristics.
judged
against
the
standards
it
is
clear
that
the
adea’s
broad
prohibition
on
the
use
of
age
is
disproportionate
to
any
supposed
remedial
objective.
second,
our
examination
of
the
act's
legislative
record
reveals
that
congress
had
virtually
no
reason
to
believe
that
state
and
local
governments
were
unconstitutionally
discriminating
against
their
employees
on
the
basis
of
age.
congress
never
identified
any
pattern
of
age
discrimination
by
the
states
much
less
any
discrimination
at
all
that
rose
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
that
failure
to
uncover
any
significant
pattern
of
unconstitutional
discrimination,
confirms
that
congress
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
broad
prophylactic
legislation
was
necessary.
in
light
of
the
act's
indiscriminant
scope
and
the
lack
of
evidence
of
wide
spread
and
unconstitutional
age
discrimination
by
the
states,
we
hold
that
the
adea
is
not
a
valid
exercise
of
congress’
section
5
power.
the
act's
purported
abrogation
of
the
state
sovereign
immunity
is
accordingly
invalid.
