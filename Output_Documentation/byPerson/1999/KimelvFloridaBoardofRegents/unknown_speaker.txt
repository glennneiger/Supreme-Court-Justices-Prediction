unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
how
many
other
federal
statutes
purport
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
without
specifically
referring
to
the
eleventh
amendment
or
to
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
because
this
statute
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
wondered
how
many
others
there
might
be
that
use
similar
language
without
any
reference
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--in
our
case,
kennecott
copper,
though,
we
didn't
think
that
the
phrase,
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
was
enough
to
do
the--
unknown
speaker
--is--
--suppose
you
had...
excuse
me.
suppose
you
had
a
jurisdiction
where
the
state
has
waived
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
its
own
courts,
but
insists
on
the
immunity
in
the
federal
courts,
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
state
court
is
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
but
that
the
federal
court
is
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
mentioned
the
igra
that
figured
in
seminole
that
didn't
use,
make
specific
reference
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
remind
me
about
title
vii.
does
title
vii
make
a
specific
reference
to
it?
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
case
the
term
public
agency
is
specifically
defined
to
include
a
state,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
probably
the
statute
goes
beyond
any
constitutional
substantive
limit,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
more
indication
in
the
history
of
this
legislation
other
than
trying
to
reach
the
private
sector?
there's
very
little
that
indicates
there
was
some
need
to
reach
state
and
local
employment--
unknown
speaker
--legislation,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
congress
was
addressing
its
attention
to
invidious
discrimination
and
yet,
in
our
murgia
case,
we
said
in
effect
that
there
wasn't,
under
the
constitution,
invidious
discrimination
when
you
classify
it
on
the
basis
of
age,
so
can
congress
change
that
constitutional
law?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
certainly
it
approved
the
use
of
stereotypes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference
between
a
generalization
and
a
stereotype?
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
your
answer
to
that
question,
not
what
congress--
unknown
speaker
--any
unfounded
prejudice
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
find
it
extraordinary
that
congress
would
have
felt
the
need
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
an
area
where
there
was
no
opinion
of
this
court
saying
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
violated,
and
a
suggestion
that
it
wasn't
violated.
congress
just
went
ahead
and
identified
on
its
own
this
serious
constitutional
violation
that
had
been
occurring
throughout
the
united
states
that,
the
existence
of
which
is
not
reflected
in
a
single
opinion
of
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
unconstitutional...
suppose
a
state
says,
you
know,
we
just
don't
have
enough
jobs.
we're
just
concerned,
and
we're
going
to
increase
the
number
of
jobs
in
the
labor
force
by
having
mandatory
retirement
at
age
55,
no
indication
that
people
can't
do
the
job
after
that,
and
that
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
but
in
murgia...
in
murgia,
it
wasn't
economic.
it
was
what
you
might
call
stereotypes
about
going
downhill
after
a
certain
age,
which--
unknown
speaker
--a
lot
of
us
can
testify
to.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
was
the
suggestion
that
the
political
process
could
deal
with
it
by
making
new
constitutional
law?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
if
congress
had
addressed
itself
in
the
adea
to
simply
arbitrary
and
irrational
judgments
based
on
age,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
went
a
good
deal
further
than
that
and
said
that
between
40
and
65,
that
you
simply
could
not
discriminate
in
any
way
between
these
people.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
indication
in
the
statute
or,
as
far
as
you
know,
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
believed
that
such
invidious
discrimination
by
the
states
was
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
that's
extraordinary.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
congress
took
this
action
in
order
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
makes
no
reference
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
or
any
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
thought
this
action
was
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
fullilove
has
been
overruled.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
you're
acting
under
section
5,
which
gives
the
enforcement
power
to
congress,
but
then
for
congress
to
go
and
say
we're
acting
under
section
5
but
we
don't
even
mention
what
constitutional
provision
we're
talking
about
seems
strange.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
oh,
excuse
me.
it's
arbitrary
and
irrational
as
to
any
particular
individual,
but
it's
not
arbitrary
and
irrational
in
gross.
unknown
speaker
which
i
thought
is
the
usual
test
for
rational
basis
scrutiny.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
in
gross
you
could
say,
you
know,
i'm
better
off
hiring
people
under
60.
is
that
an
irrational
calculation?
you
can
say
it's
irrational
as
to
this
individual.
you
can't
say
for
sure
that
he
can't
do
the
job
just
because
he's
over
60.
but
if
i
make
a
generalization,
i'm
better
off
having
younger
workers,
is
that
irrational?
unknown
speaker
so
is
that
irrational?
is
that
irrational?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
hire
somebody
who
will
be
with
my
company
for
a
long
time.
i
don't
want
somebody
that's
going
to
be
retiring
relatively
soon.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
false--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
person
who's
40
is
going
to
be
retiring
sooner
than
the
person
who's
20.
how
is
that
false?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
can
say
as
a
policy
matter
we
shouldn't
allow
this.
that's
fine.
unknown
speaker
but
to
say
that
it's
unconstitutional
because
it's
irrational,
i...
it
just
boggles
my
mind.
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
retire
sooner.
unknown
speaker
exclude
one
reason.
i
mean,
you
can
exclude
one
reason
for
losing
the
worker,
and
that's
not
irrational.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
very
least
there
wasn't
any
focus,
was
there,
on
state
action?
unknown
speaker
there's
just
very
little
reference
to
state
action,
and
don't
most
states
have
their
own
age
discrimination
laws
today?
unknown
speaker
they
certainly
do
now.
unknown
speaker
could
not
these
very
plaintiffs
have
pursued
state
law
actions?
certainly
florida
has
actions--
unknown
speaker
--but
florida
clearly
has
laws.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
in
that
respect
it
resembles
title
vii,
doesn't
it,
because
there
were
eeo
laws
in
the
states
long
before
title
vii
came
on
the
books,
and
i
believe
when
title
vii
was
extended
to
public
employment,
state
and
federal,
the
vast
majority
of
states
had
their
own
antidiscrimination
statutes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
reason
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
race
discrimination
is
not
some
generalized
notion
that
it's
irrational,
but
the
explicit
constitutional
prohibition
of
it.
that's
quite
a
different--
unknown
speaker
--maybe,
but
i've
never
heard
it
argued
on
the
basis
of
irrationality,
that
the
reason
congress
can
do
this
is
that
sex
discrimination
is
irrational,
and
therefore...
and
therefore
title...
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
triggered.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
ms.
underwood,
by
that
standard,
things
that
are
dealt
with
on
a
rational
basis
approach,
zoning
decisions
and
that
sort
of
thing,
they're
all
within
congress'
section
5
power
under
your
view,
because
there
can
be
existent
cases
of
arbitrary
exercises
of
that
authority.
unknown
speaker
and
i
presume
congress
could
then
address
the
subject.
unknown
speaker
what
if
congress
were
to
look
over
a
whole
bunch
of
zoning
decisions
and
say,
there's
just
evidence
throughout
the
country
that
people
are
being
deprived
of
their
right
to
make
the
best
use
of
their
property
by
these
zoning
decisions,
so
we're
just
going
to
make
it
a
federal
statute
that
allows
you
to
bring
everything
in
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
their
class
is
developers.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
that
the
far-reaching
nature
of
these
questions
respecting
congress'
power
under
the
fifth...
fifth
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
reason
why
we
should
insist
on
a
very
clear
statement
of
intent
to
abrogate
in
the
first
place,
then
congress
could
have
these
debates.
congress
did
not
have
this
debate
that
we
are
having
here.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
come
to
anything
close
to
it.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
when
congress
makes
a
conclusion
of
irrationality
regarding
the
treatment
of
some
insular
minority
within
the
electorate,
i'm
inclined
to
credit
it.
when
congress
makes
such
a
determination
of
irrationality
with
regard
to
the
treatment
of
a
body
of
voters
that
is
enormous,
i
am
a
little
more
skeptical.
unknown
speaker
and
a
body
of
voters
that
changes.
i
mean,
we're
all
going
to
be
old.
it's
unlike
other
personal
characteristics
that
you
mentioned,
race,
sex
and
so
forth.
some
of
us
never
have
to
worry
about
that,
right,
and
you
cannot
say
that
about
age.
we're
all
going
to
be
old,
and
therefore
you
can
assume
that
the
laws
regarding
what
happens
to
the
elderly
will
be
more
fairly...
will
be
more
fairly
adopted
than
those
regarding
race
or
sex.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
underwood.
it's
you
rather
than
mr.
collins,
then,
who
will
do
the
rebuttal.
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
sutton.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
i
don't
understand
this
argument
of
yours.
how
does
626(c)
have
independent
effect
under
your
interpretation?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
under
either
one
it's
swallowed
up
by
the
later
provision,
the
incorporation
of
section
216,
no?
unknown
speaker
when
i
put
these
statutes
together
by
using
quotes
and
brackets
and
so
forth,
i
got
the
following:
bracket,
the
adea,
bracket,
shall
be
enforced
in
accordance
with
the,
bracket,
quote,
following,
quote,
provision.
a
suit
for
violation,
quote,
may
be
maintained
by,
quote,
any
employee,
quote,
against
any
employer
including,
quote,
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state,
end
quote,
in
any
federal,
dot,
dot,
dot,
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
now,
if
i
put
them
together,
how
could
it
be
clearer?
unknown
speaker
if
i
put
them
together
right.
unknown
speaker
if
that
section
had
been
repealed,
would
you
then
agree
that
there
had
been
a
valid
abrogation,
or
are
you
arguing
in
effect
that
congress
must
say
in
so
many
words
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
the
states
shall
not
be
immune
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
without
saying,
and
the
eleventh
amendment
is
hereby
abrogated.
unknown
speaker
so
what
would
you
here...
if
you
say,
you
don't
need
those
magic
words,
what
in
addition
to
the
repealing
of
the
section...
whose
number
i
forgot,
what,
in
addition,
would
it
have
taken?
unknown
speaker
how
about
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
although
they
didn't
say
the
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
is
abrogated.
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
could
have
been
thinking
of
state
in
an
ex
parte
young
sense,
the
injunctive
relief.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
was
decided
wrongly.
unknown
speaker
just
before
you
get
there--
unknown
speaker
--has
either
florida
or
alabama
permitted
a
suit
in
its
own
court,
waived
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts,
in
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
howell
wasn't
the
state,
was
it?
i
mean,
wasn't
it
a
county
or
something?
unknown
speaker
can
i
quickly
ask
you
on
that
626(c)(1),
it
looks
as
if
its
there
either
to
specify
legal
and
equitable
or
for
the
purpose
of
putting
in
the
proviso.
unknown
speaker
wall,
you
could
write
(c)(1)
in
order
to
put
in
the
proviso.
you
want
to
know
why
did
congress
write
it
if
the
other
thing
means
what
it
says,
and
the
answer
could
be,
because
they
wanted
to
stick
in
that
proviso.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
seven
out
of
those
eight
steps
can
be
eliminated
by
the
simple
fact
that
the
elderly
employee
just
says,
life
is
too
short,
and
doesn't
seek
litigation.
i
mean,
that
would
jump
over
seven
of
the
eight.
i
mean,
it's
possible
that
it
is
a
problem,
but
people
just
haven't
had
the
time
or
the
incentive
or
the
gumption
or
whatever
to
sue
about
it.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
adea
require
you
to
touch
base
with
state
law?
that
is,
before
you
can
institute
a
federal
suit,
mustn't
you
invoke
the
state
process?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
one
point
in
this
that
puzzles
me.
i
think
i
heard
you
concede
that
there
could
be
an
action
for
injunctive
relief,
an
ex
parte
young
relief,
forward-looking,
against
a
state
that
is
maintaining
a
practice
of
discriminating
against
people
over
the
age
of
40.
did
you
say
that
that
legitimately
under
ex
parte
young
the
state
could
be
sued?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
mean
that.
last--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
so
we
have
action
against
a
state
official--
unknown
speaker
--to
stop
using
this
formula
to
calculate
salaries
because
it
discriminates
against
older
people,
stop
order
from
the
federal
court.
armed
with
that
stop
order,
could
the
employee
then
go
into
his
state
court,
which
has
a
state
law
that
waives
the
state
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
court,
and
say,
here's
my
federal
judgment,
it
says
the
practice
was
illegal,
that's
issue
preclusion,
now
figure
out
what
compensation
i'm
owed?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
a
federal
law
claim.
it's
a
state
law
claim,
but
the
fact
question,
was
there
discrimination
against
older
workers
under
this
formula,
has
already
decided,
been
decided
in
the
federal
court.
then
the
worker
comes
to
state
court,
suing
under
state
law,
and
all
he's
saying
is,
this
fact
issue
has
been
precluded,
so
the
only
thing
that
the
state
can
do,
following
ordinary
rules
of
issue
preclusion,
is
to
figure
out
how
much.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
depend
on
state
law?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
follow
the
beginning
in
the
state,
because
you'd
have
no
reason
to
go
into
the
federal
court
for
ex
parte
young
injunctive
relief
if
you
win
on
the
merits
in
the
state,
where
you
could
get
both.
unknown
speaker
and
you
might
be...
if
you
tried
it,
that,
encounter
a
problem
of
splitting
your
claims.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that...
given
your
argument,
does
that
as
a
practical
matter
entail
that
there
simply
cannot
be
general
statutory
enforcement
of
a
first
tier
equal
protection
claim
in
the
practical
world,
so
that
your
position
really
is
that
you
can
enforce...
congress
can
enforce
by
general
legislation
antidiscrimination
against
suspect
categories
and
so
on,
but
that
is
really
in
practical
terms
the
extent
of
the
enforcement
power
under
section
5?
unknown
speaker
what
would
that...
true,
but
what
would
that
accomplish?
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
good
would
it
do?
unknown
speaker
why
not
simply
leave
it
to
the
individual
claimant
to
come
in
under
1983?
that
would--
unknown
speaker
--would
there
be
any
advantage?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
on
your
view.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
suggesting
that
as
a
cosmic
matter
that
i
am
adopting
your
view.
unknown
speaker
i'm
simply
exploring
your
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
where
do
you
put
sex
discrimination,
then,
in
the...
because
as
i
understand
it,
there's
race
and
national
origin
and
religion
in
title
vii--
unknown
speaker
--which
all
had
something
before
the
civil
rights
act
in
1964
to
suggest
that
those
were
suspect
categories,
but
sex
discrimination,
as
i
think
was
pointed
out,
even
in
the
time
title
vii
was
extended,
the
only
decision
on
the
book
was
reed
v.
reed,
and
that
applied
a
rational
basis
test.
unknown
speaker
could
you
add
anything
to
the
catalogue?
you
said
you
recognize
that
congress
was
making
a
prediction,
which
the
court
later
bore
out,
in
that
sex
classifications
deserved
exacting
scrutiny.
is
there
anything
else
that's
not
in
the
catalogue
yet
that
could
be
there,
that
congress
could
make
a
predictive
judgment
about,
or
are
we
at
the
limit?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position,
when
considering
proportionality
with
respect
to
a
first
tier
rational
basis
equal
protection
category,
that
it
is
irrelevant,
or
at
least
unnecessary
for
us
to
consider
the
defenses
in
the
statute,
e.g.,
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
and
so
on,
and
limitations
on
remedies?
in
this
case,
i
think
the
remedy
is
limited
simply
to
back
pay.
are
those
things
really
irrelevant,
because
the
burden
of
proof
issue,
and
the
scope
of
coverage
which
follows
from
it,
is
so
dispositive
that
we
never
get
to
look
at
these
other
things
like
defenses
and
limited
remedies
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
goes
to
federalism,
but
is
it...
do
you
take
the
position
that
it's
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
proportionality?
unknown
speaker
it
just
doesn't
get
you
across
the
line.
but
in
any
case,
you
are
taking
the
position
that
the
disparity
between
the
scope,
as
determined
by
the
burden
of
proof,
let's
say
in
1983
litigation,
and
the
burden
of
proof
under
this
statute,
is
not
dispositive
totally,
without
consideration
of
such
factors
as
those
that
justice
ginsburg
and
i
have
been
mentioning.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
can
i
just
ask
one
very
minor
question.
the
facts
aren't
very
clear,
because
everybody
just
got
right
to
the
legal
issues.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
in
all
three
cases
the
plaintiffs
are
citizens
of
the
same
state
that
they're
suing,
so
that
this
is
not
the
real
eleventh
amendment,
in
my
view
of
the
two
eleventh
amendment
problems.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
quite
parallel,
because
the
discrimination
there
is
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
national
origin,
which
was
clearly
unconstitutional
discrimination,
and
the
only
issue
was
whether
this
device
achieved
it
or
not.
what
we
have
here
is
whether
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
in
and
of
itself
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
was
irrational
under
the...
under
our
constitutional
jurisprudence?
