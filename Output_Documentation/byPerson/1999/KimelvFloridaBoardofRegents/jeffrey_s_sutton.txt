mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1974,
congress
became
the
26th
legislature
in
the
country
to
enact
an
age
discrimination
law
that
applied
to
public
employees.
in
1983,
7
years
later,
this
court
in
eeoc
v.
wyoming
held
that
the
age
discrimination
act
was
permissible
commerce
clause
legislation
that
applied
to
the
states.
we
do
not
challenge
that
holding.
in
the
wyoming
case,
four
justices
also
reached
the
question
whether
the
age
laws
were
permissible
section
5
legislation.
they
concluded
that
they
were
not.
we
agree
with
that
reasoning
for
two
reasons.
first,
congress
failed
unmistakably
to
abrogate
the
states'
immunity
from
suit
and,
second,
lacked
the
power
to
do
so.
as
to
the
clear
statement
point,
i'd
like
to
pick
up
on
some
of
the
questioning
in
the
first
half
of
the
argument.
there
are
two
principal
problems,
we
would
submit,
with
the
clear
statement
claim
petitioners
have
made.
first
of
all,
they
have
read
626(c)
out
of
the
statute.
the
court
enforcement
provision
that
has
existed
in
626(c)
from
1967
all
the
way
to
the
present
accomplishes
nothing
if
petitioners'
reading
of
the
incorporation
argument
is
correct,
and
that's
the
first
problem.
the
second
problem
is
626(c),
even
on
its
own
terms,
and
i
would
even
submit
216(b),
does
not
suffice
precisely
for
the
reason
justice
kennedy
identified,
that
the
phrase,
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
still
creates
an
ambiguity
about
abrogation.
indeed,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
recognized
in
the
missouri
employees
case.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
in
incorporating
some
of
the
powers
and
remedies
of
the
flsa
enforcement
provision,
this
is
simply
not
one
of
the
ones
that
was
picked
up,
for
the
basic
reason
that
the
626(c)
enforcement
provision
already
existed,
was
not
repealed
in
1974,
and
has
not
been
repealed
since,
so
in
order
to
credit
petitioner's
argument
one
must
assume
that
congress
did
a
useless
act.
the
useless
act
was
to
have
626(c),
the
very
first
sentence,
still
in
existence
after
1974,
and
it's
an
accepted
canon
of
construction
that
congress
doesn't
do
a
useless
act,
that
the
words
of
every
statute
have
some
purpose
and
meaning.
that
may
not
be
the
best
reading
of
all
of
these
statutes,
but
that's
not
our
burden.
our
burden
is
simply
to
show
that
it's
a
plausible
one,
and
that
they
have
not
left
any
reason
beyond
a
doubt
that
their
reading
is
the
correct
one.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
two
problems,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--first
of
all,
the
problem
that
justice
kennedy
identified,
the
phrase,
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
by
itself
is
ambivalent,
the
reason
being
there
are
two
issues
in
an
abrogation
case.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
subsequent
provisions
of
the
law
have
been
extended
to
the
public
agency.
we
don't
dispute
that.
they
have
been
extended.
but
the
second
question
is
whether
one
of
the
principal
defenses
to
those
claims
has
been
abrogated.
there's
plenty
of
reason
to
have
a
statute
that
reads
just
as
you've
read
it.
i
would
point
out
that
you've
used
several
subchapters
and
incorporated
several
of
them,
but
i
admit
correctly
under
petitioner's
reading.
the
problem
with
it
is,
you
could
still
have
a
situation
where
you
need
that
statute
for
a
federal
government
action
against
a
state
for
money
damages,
which
is
permissible
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
you
could
have
a
situation
in
which
you
bring
such
claims
in
federal
court
and
the
state
waives
its
immunity
from
suit,
which
is
permissible,
or
you
could
have
justice
kennedy's
situation,
where
such
claims
are
permissible
in
state
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
where
there's
a
waiver.
but
your
reading
does
leave
a
redundancy,
and
the
redundancy
is
in
626(c)(1),
and
the
thing
i've
not
heard
raised
or
shown
by
petitioners
is
how
626(c)(1)
accomplishes
anything.
it's
at
page
93a
of
the
cert
petition.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
our
case
gets
much
harder,
your
honor,
at
that
point.
in
effect
at
that
point
i'd
be
saying
that
it
didn't
even
suffice
for
the
fsla,
which
of
course
is
a
difficult
argument.
in
1973,
the
missouri
employees
decision
came
out
saying
the
abrogation
was
insufficient.
one
year
later,
they
did
amend
the
statute,
clearly
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
that
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
they've
not
used
what
we'll
call
magic
words
to
say
the
eleventh
amendment,
so
my
case--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--just
what
we
have
in
seminole
tribe,
which
is
several
mentions
of
the
phrase,
state,
in
the
enforcement
provision,
the
state
itself,
not
just
in
the
court
enforcement
provision,
but
throughout
the
whole
remedial
scheme.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
title
vii
is...
does
mention
the
public
body
in
the
scheme
itself.
in
other
words,
when
they
made
the
amendment,
i
think
it's
in
'72,
to
extend
title
vii
to
the
states,
they
mentioned
state
in
the
enforcement
provision,
and
so
that
does
suffice.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
true,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that
is
true,
and
i
think
that
is
an
ambiguity,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
justice
kennedy's
question
prompts,
is
the
question--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor.
no
one
raised
the
clear
statement
question,
and
i'm
not
saying...
i
don't
want
to
be
mistaken,
and
i
hope
i
didn't
misspeak.
i'm
not
saying
there
is
an
insufficient
clear
statement
in
title
vii.
that's...
we
don't
take
that
position.
in
fact,
we
think
the
title
vii
case
is
very
much
like
seminole
tribe
and
is
controlled
by
it.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
switch
to
the
power
question.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
there
are
published
florida
opinions
where
there
are
money
damages
actions
brought
against
public
employees
in
state
court
against
florida,
public
employers,
as
to--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--oh,
under
that...
i'm...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer.
my
assumption
is
that
most
of
these
claims
are
brought
in
federal
court.
keep
in
mind,
and
hallett
v.
rose
was
a
case
that
came
from
florida,
it
would
be
a
difficult
situation
for
a
state
to
abrogate
immunity
as
to
state
law
age
discrimination
claims
and
then
not
abrogate
it
as
to
federal
claims.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
was
a
county,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
controlling,
but
i'm
just
raising
the
issue,
and
i
think
the
issue
would
be,
at
least
in
the
language
of
hallett,
and
justice
stevens
can
back
me
up,
the
language
of
hallett
would
be
the
question
of
whether
the
state
is
discriminating
against
federal
rights,
and
that
could
potentially
be
a
problem.
i'm
not
taking
a
position
one
side
or
the
other,
but
it
is
in
an
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
right,
your
honor.
well,
the
proviso,
we're
not
referring
to
the
redundancy
there.
it
would
be
the
first
sentence--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--uh-huh.
well,
let
me
answer
the
first
question,
which
it
turns
out
is
a
little
easier
than
the
second.
as
to
the
first
question,
216(b),
the
so-called
incorporated
provision,
also
refers
to
legal
or
equitable
relief,
so
in
that
sense
they
are
utterly...
they
are
utterly
redundant.
as
to
your
second
point,
i
suppose
that
is
a
conceivable
argument,
but
again
i
would
go
back
to
what
my
burden
is,
is
not
to
rebut
every
conceivable
argument,
but
to
show
that
it
wasn't
clear.
as
to
power,
city
of
boerne
makes
clear
that
there
were
two
inquiries.
the
first
is...
and
i
want
to
be
clear,
two
inquiries
when
it
comes
to
prophylactic
legislation.
that
is,
section
5
legislation
that
goes
beyond
what
in
this
case
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires.
the
first
inquiry
is
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
predicate
for
imposing
extra
constitutional
requirements
on
the
states.
the
second
is
whether
the
section
5
law
at
the
end
of
the
day
is,
in
fact,
proportional.
as
to
the
predicate,
we
would
submit
that,
while
there
may
well
be
age
discrimination
in
an
article
i
sense
in
the
states,
in
the
federal
government,
in
the
private
sector,
when
it
comes
to
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
discrimination
by
state
employers,
the
record
shows
absolutely
nothing.
first
of
all,
the
law
was
extended
in
1974.
murgia
isn't
even
decided
until
1976.
the
whole
concept
of
constitutional
violations
regarding
the
elderly
wasn't
even
on
the
radar
screen
in
1974,
and
that's
exactly
why
the
congressional
record
is
so
silent.
it
wasn't
something
anyone
was
debating.
but
even
if
one
goes
beyond
1974,
and
we
think
that
would
be
permissible,
all
the
way
to
the
present,
looking
at
cases
from
this
court,
the
state
courts,
the
federal
courts,
the
record
is
still
silent.
now,
the
federal
government
in
its
reply
brief
has
identified
three
cases.
these,
by
the
way,
are
the
only
three
cases
that
have
been
identified
so
far
in
the
briefing
in
this
case
regarding
state
discrimination
against
the
elderly
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
none
of
them
suffice.
first,
for
the
most
obvious
reason,
none
of
them
involve
state
employment.
every
single
one
of
them
dealt
with
state
laws.
they
didn't
involve
state
employers
violating
the
equal
protection
rights
of
their
state
employees,
which
after
all
is
just
what
the
adea
is
about.
one
of
the
cases,
the
seventh
circuit
case,
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
a
situation
where
the
state
simply
hadn't
supplied
any
rational
basis,
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
said,
at
a
minimum,
you've
got
to
give
us
something,
and
rejected
the
motion
to
dismiss.
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
the
second
case
is
even
worse.
that's
a
case
in
which
the
discrimination
was
against
22
and
21-year-olds
who
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
live
off
campus
in
college.
23-year-olds
were
given
that
right.
well,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
but
it
was
certainly
not
one
that
helps
prevent
discrimination
against
those
over
40.
and
the
third
case
from
colorado
is
a
state
court
case,
involve
violations
under
the
state
and
u.s.
constitution,
which
of
course
precluded
review
here
and
again
did
not
involve
a
state
employee.
but
again,
congress
does
have
authority
to
do
more.
in
other
words,
they
don't
have
to
wait
till
a
record
of
violations
piles
up
and
suddenly
act
after
there
have
been
50
or
so.
there's
no
doubt
they
can
head
the
problem
off,
cut
it
off
at
the
pass,
but
there's
no
such
threat,
and
to
use
the
words
of
florida
prepaid,
any
such
harm
is
exceedingly
speculative,
and
the
reason
it's
speculative,
we
would
submit,
is
if
you
look
at
page
38
in
our
brief,
we've
identified
what
i
think
are
eight
preconditions
for
an
equal
protection
violation
by
a
state
employer
to
go
unremedied.
first,
the
states
would
have
to
not
properly
enforce
their
age
discrimination
laws,
which,
after
all,
overprotect
the
constitutional
rights
of
their
employees.
then
the
state
and
federal
lower
courts
would
have
to
deny
relief
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
this
court
would
have
to
deny
relief
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
individual
would
not
be
able
to
get
ex
parte
young
relief
in
federal
court,
which
is,
after
all,
still
permissible
after
eeoc
v.
wyoming.
the
eeoc
as
a
federal
agency
would
have
to
decide
that
however
grave
this
violation
was,
it
wasn't
important
enough
for
them
to
bring
the
action
for
money
damages
in
federal
court
and
then,
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
judgment
in
vance
v.
bradley
that
even
improvident
decisions
by
state
and
federal
governments
usually
are
corrected
by
the
political
process,
and
one
would
presume
that
would
likely
be
the
case
in
that
particular--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no
doubt,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
a
problem
the
adea
is
going
to
cure.
if
they're
not
going
to
use
the
state
laws,
if
they're
not
going
to
use
the
u.s.
constitution,
the
state
constitution,
the
political
process,
it
seems
to
me
exceptionally
unlikely--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that
is
true,
and
there's
a
60-day
wait
before
you
can
bring
a
federal
action,
but
there's
nothing
about
the
age
laws
that
require
you
to
wait.
all
one
has
to
do
is
file
in
state,
and
it
can
be
rather
informal,
just
with
the
human
rights
commission,
and
at
that
point
there's
a
60-day
timetable
before
you
can
bring
a
federal
court
action.
there's
no
requirement,
which
would
be,
i
think,
somewhat
respectful
of
the
state--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--excuse
me.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
exactly.
exactly,
so
you
do
have
the
precondition
of
filing
in
state
court,
but
there's
no
requirement
that
you
sit
and
wait
and
see
if
you
get
state
relief.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i...
i'm
sure
i
did,
and
i
most
clearly
misspoke.
it
would
have
to
be
an
action
against
a
state
official
under
ex
parte
young.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
okay.
well,
no,
then
i...
my...
i'm
pretty
sure
i
made
that
concession.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
that
raises
some
of
the
questions
we
were
addressing
earlier,
and
that's
whether
the
state
waiver
with
respect
to
claims
under
state
law
constitutes
a
waiver
for
federal
law
claims.
that
would
be
one
problem
we
have
there.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
the
premise
of
the
question
about
ordinary
rules
of
issue
and
claim
preclusion,
and
i'm
certainly
underarmed
against
you
on
this
particular
issue,
if
that
is
correct,
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
i
mean,
if
they...
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
if
those
rules
of
issue
and
claim
preclusion
do
apply
in
state
courts
under
state
law,
then
there's
no
reason
you
couldn't
do
it,
just
for
the
same
reason
you
couldn't
go
in
reverse.
if
you
won
under...
in
a
state
claim
under
federal
law,
if
the
federal
rules
of
issue
and
claim
preclusion
permitted
it,
you
could
do
the
same
thing
in
federal
court,
but
again,
on
the
assumption
that
those
rules
of
preclusion
did
apply,
and
permissibly
applied
as
to
claims
in
one
court
based
on--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that
is
true.
i'm
just
saying
as
a--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
i'm
just
saying
as
a
theoretical
matter,
one
could.
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
a
practical
thing
to
do.
the
second
problem
with
the
adea
is
one
regarding
proportionality,
and
the
proportionality
problem
i
think
is
best
illustrated
by
this
court's
decision
in
western
airlines
v.
criswell,
which
dealt
with
an
age
law
claim,
and
it
was
actually
a
situation
in
which
the
corporate
employer
came
in
and
tried
to
win
the
age
claim
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
the
disparate
treatment
of
an
individual
over
40.
and
the
court
quite
categorically
made
clear
that
rational
basis
review
does
not
apply
in
an
age
claim,
and
in
fact
said
that
that's
a
virtually
unreviewable
standard,
and
one
in
which
an
employer
would
always
win.
in
fact,
there
would
be
no
reason
even
to
go
to
a
jury
in
an
age
claim
and--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
they...
and
i
think
i'm
answering
your
question...
they
can
always
pass
legislation
that
creates
a
standard
that
parallels
the
equal
protection
standard
and
supplies--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
i...
1983
is
an
enforcement
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--and
i
think
you're
right
to
suggest
that
there
aren't
going
to
be
many
situations
where
an
individual
is
going
to
have
a
successful
equal
protection
claim
for
discrimination
against
the
elderly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
yes.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
no,
no.
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
but
i...
and
i'm
answering
it
by
referring
to
this
court's
cases,
and
that
would
be
under
murgia,
bradley,
and
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
that
that
seems
to
me
a
very
difficult
standard
to
meet.
i
mean,
my
guess
is
we
could
posit
utterly
irrational
laws
that
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age
and
in
which
there
was
no
rational
justification,
even
after
the
fact,
no
conceivable
basis,
but
that
hasn't
happened.
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
around
since
1868,
and
no
one's
found
one
yet,
so
it
does
strike
me
as
very
unlikely,
completely
unlikely
up
to
now,
and
very
unlikely
into
the
future.
but
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
title
vii,
when
it
comes
to
gender
discrimination,
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
fact
that
congress
is
allowed,
as
a
predictive
matter,
to
make
its
own
judgment
about
what
the
constitution
means,
and
in
1972
it
is
true,
when
congress
extended
title
vii
to
gender
discrimination,
gender
discrimination
still
received
rational
basis
review.
that
doesn't
mean
it
would
be
impossible
to
use
it,
but
it
would
have
made
it
a
lot
more
difficult.
in
1976,
when
fitzpatrick
was
decided,
or
if
this
issue
were
reviewed
today,
it
would
not
receive
rational
basis
review.
it
would
get
exacting
scrutiny.
so
congress
is
fully
entitled
to
make
that
predictive
judgment.
the
thing
it
can't
do,
as
city
of
boerne
reveals,
is,
it
can't
make
a
predictive
judgment
and
then
impose
it
on
the
court.
ultimately,
when
that
section
5
claim
gets
to
the
court,
it's
the
court's
judgment
as
to
what
the
constitution
means.
now,
as
to
remedies,
the
extent
of
them,
congress
does
get
wide
discretion,
as
city
of
boerne
confirms.
the
other
thing
is,
i
think
gender
discrimination
and
really
all
of
the
protected
classes
in
title
vii
not
only
are
presumptively
unconstitutional
classifications,
whereas
age
is
presumptively
constitutional,
those
are
all
instances
where
you're
going
to
have
a
predicate
of
some
violations.
just
looking
at
this
court's
cases
you're
going
to
find
that
predicate,
so
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
couldn't
begin
to
answer
that.
i
apologize,
but
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
even
want
to
step
into
congress'
shoes
on
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
they
are
allowed
to
look
at
that
issue.
they
are
allowed
to
decide
that
perhaps
there
is
a
discrete
and
insular
group
with
immutable
characteristics
that
do
warrant
additional
constitutional
protection.
that
judgment's
entitled
to
some
respect,
but
it's
not
entitled
to
complete
respect.
when
that
case,
and
when
that
legislative
judgment
gets
to
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
important
issue,
and
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
your
question.
i
don't
think
the
important
question
is
whether
such
classes
are
out
there.
the
important
question
is,
what
happens
when
that
section
5
law
gets
to
court.
and
what
happens
is,
this
court
decides
whether
there's
proportionality
and
whether
there's
a
predicate
for
this
prophylactic
legislation,
and
if
it
turns
out
they
predict
correctly,
well,
it's
really
not
that
prophylactic.
it
may
be
in
most
cases
that
the
legislative
standard
parallels
the
constitutional
standard,
in
which
case
there's
not
much
of
a
section
5
inquiry.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all
i
would
say
the
defenses
don't
parallel
equal
protection
clause
defenses,
so
that's
one
of
the
central
arguments
we're
making,
and
i
think
it
is
borne
out
by
this
court's
decision
in
western
airlines,
but
there
are...
it's
true,
there
are
things
in
the
statute.
justice
ginsburg
identified
one.
there's
a
60-day
waiting
period
before
the
claim
can
be
brought
in
federal
court.
elected
state
officials
and
their
top
staff
are
insulated
from
adea
claims.
so
it's
true
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
it
is
relevant.
it
just
doesn't
do
the
trick.
it's
not
even--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--just,
when
you
say
1983
litigation,
you're
referring
to
litigation
involving
equal
protection
claims--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--exactly.
well,
your
honor,
i
do
think
it
is
unfortunately
a
contextual
facts,
fact
and
circumstances
inquiry
where
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
those
things,
but
it
seems
to
me
at
the
threshold
this
court's
western
airlines
decision
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
on
the
one
hand
the
age
laws
were
designed
to
deal
with
prohibiting
the
employers
from
making
the
generalization
that
mental
and
physical
acuity
decline
with
age.
in
contrast
to
that
are
this
court's
trilogy
of
decisions
where
they
say
that
is
permitted
by
federal
and
state
legislatures,
so
that...
that
strikes
me
as
a
very
serious
threshold
problem.
now,
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
don't
consider
at
all,
it
all.
in
fact,
i
think
we
should
embrace
the
fact
that
it
is
a
fact
and
circumstances
test,
and
that
there
is
no
rosetta
stone
here,
and
the
reason
that's
good
is
because
the
greater
the
underlying
violations,
the
more
remedial
power
congress
ought
to
have.
so
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
embrace
that
fact
and
circumstances
problem,
because
while
it's
difficult
for
this
court
when
it
comes
to
drawing
those
lines,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
have
the
freedom
to
give
congress
much
more
authority
in
situations
where
there
truly
has
been
a
record,
in
the
case
of
voting
rights
a
record
of
pervasive
and
systematic
discrimination
against
certain
classes--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--with
that
last
caveat,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that
is
true.
the...
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
in
closing,
it
seems
to
us,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
that
the
age
laws
are
unlike
any
other
prophylactic
section
5
law
this
court
has
ever
upheld.
instead
of
pervasive
discrimination
by
state
employers,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
all
50
states
overprotect
the
constitutional
rights
of
their
citizens.
instead
of
a
calibrated
remedy
that
seeks
to
parallel
the
constitutional
standard,
we
have
an
entirely
new
standard
of
review
that
directly
contradicts
this
court's
decision
in
western
airlines,
and
instead
of
systematic,
constitutional
violations
of
the
protected
class,
we
have
absolutely
none.
it
would
seem
to
me
a
sad
and
unfortunate
irony
to
uphold
this
broadest
of
section
5
laws
precisely
in
the
areas
where
the
state
is
not
only
respecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
their
citizens,
but
in
fact
overprotecting
them.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--thank
you,
your
honor.
