justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
justice
kennedy's
problem
would
be
eliminated
if
the
school
simply
said,
the
captain
of
the
football
team
shall
deliver
the
solemnizing
message
or
invocation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
that's
the
only
thing
that's...
you
know,
that
has
to
be
fiddled
with
in
this
arrangement
we
haven't
achieved
a
whole
lot
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
perhaps
they
could
say
the
student
with
the
highest
grade,
or
something
else,
and
then
you
wouldn't
have
the
election,
and
then
it
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
before
this,
i
guess
before
lee
v.
weisman
the
school
used
to
have
somebody
deliver
a...
an
invocation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
was...
was
it
nonsectarian
religious?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
been,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
under
this
policy
you
must
allow
the
student,
if
he
wishes,
to
invoke
jesus
christ,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
say
a
hail
mary,
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
real
advance.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sekulow,
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
a
distinction
between
prayer
as
violating
the
first
amendment
and
proselytization,
or
for
that
matter
criticizing
religion
as
violating
the
first
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
do
you
assert
that
this
facial
challenge
has
to
fail
simply
because
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
whatever
student
is
selected
will
deliver
a
prayer
or
a
religious
invocation?
is
that
alone
enough
to
defeat
the
facial
challenge?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
surprised
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
i
assume
that
that
statement
in
rosenberger,
which
said
the
full
spectrum
of
political
speech,
focused
on
political
speech
because
that's
what
the
policy
that
the
school
put
in
place
was
intended
to
foster.
if
it's
a
limited
purpose
forum
in
this
case
i
think
all
you
would
have
to
defend
is
that
there
would
be
the
full
spectrum
of
solemnizing
and
of
solemnizing
speech,
which
would
be
students
saying,
you
know,
let's
pause
in
memory
of
the
members
of
the
football
team
last
year
who
got
killed
in
a
car
crash,
or
whatever.
why
would
you
want
to
defend
the
proposition
that
all
manner
of
political
speech
would...
i
mean,
surely
all
manner
of
political
speech
wouldn't
be
allowed
in
this
case.
it's
only
solemnizing
speech
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
about
that?
that's
just
a
curiosity
i
have
in
this
case.
i
don't
even
know
who
the
plaintiffs
are.
is
there...
how
come
it's
jane
doe?
i
mean,
are
these
minors?
is...
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
people
have
rights
to
sue
anonymously
in
federal
court?
is
anybody
who
just
doesn't
want
it
known
that
he's
bring
a
lawsuit,
he's
ashamed
of
it
for
one
reason
or
another,
can
sue
anonymously?
i
didn't
know
we
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
it
wasn't
clear
at
the
time...
in
fact,
it
still
isn't
clear,
is
it
+/?
that
lee
v.
weisman
applies
to
football
games.
it
surely
applies
to
commencements,
where
the...
your
client's
child
would
presumably
have
to
go,
but
your
client's
child
doesn't
have
to
go
to
football
games,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
rigid
rule
we
adopted
in
lee
v.
weisman
that
you
cannot
have
even
nondenominational
invocation
at
graduation,
would
not
apply
to
football
games.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
can
be
majoritarian
prayer,
and
you
expect
that
in
most
cases
it
will
be,
but
it
need
not
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
on
it's
face,
it
need
not
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
majority
can
elect
somebody
who
does
not
want
to
give
a
prayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
it's
not
necessarily
majoritarian
prayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
say
that
in
every
case
it's
going
to
produce
a
prayer.
you
just
can't.
now,
you
may
suspect
that
in
most
cases
it
will,
but
you
know,
when
we
appoint
chaplains
in
the
armed
forces
on
the
basis
of
what
the
needs
of
the
members
of
the
armed
forces
are,
you
can
predict
that
the
majority
of
them
are
going
to
be
christian
chaplains,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
is
favoring
one
sect
over
another.
why
does
it
necessarily
mean
here
that
the
government
is
favoring
prayer
over
nonprayer?
it's
just
opened
it
up
and
say,
you
do
what
you
want.
it
knows
what
the
result
will
be,
as
you
predict.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
you
will.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
show,
in
order
to
prove
this
is
a
neutral
law,
that
somebody
can
get
up
and
say
religion
is
bunk.
i
mean,
we
have
a
provision
for
a
thanksgiving
proclamation.
now,
i
assume
a
president
can,
if
he
wishes,
issue
a
neutral
one
that
is
nonreligious,
or
he
can
issue
a
religious
one.
i
cannot
imagine
his
issuing
one
that
says
religion
is
bunk,
because
it
does
not
pertain
to
the
subject
matter
for
which
the
proclamation
was
designed,
and
it's
the
same
thing
at
football
games.
the
only
reason
religion
is
bunk
is
out
is
because
it's
not
within
the
subject
matter
of
solemnizing
the
occasion.
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
says
just
message,
that
seems
to
be
purged.
i
mean,
it
isn't
even
alluding
to
anything
that
even
sounds
like
a
prayer,
as
you
believe
invocation
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
even
a
facial
challenge.
i
mean,
bear
in
mind
this
is
a
facial...
i
mean,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
you
could
maintain
a
facial
challenge
if
they
just
used
the
word
message.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
anybody
forced
to
be
a
cheerleader,
or
a
band
member,
or
a
football
player?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
get
your
point.
the
congressional
chaplain
is
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
then
therefore
anything
that
could
lead
to
some
sectarian
controversy
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
eliminate
that
possibility
100
percent
without
driving
religion
out
of
public
life
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
griffin,
some
school
functions
are
educational.
the
school
is
acting
as
a
parent
to
the
children,
teaching
them,
education.
but
other
school
functions
in
many
communities
are
social.
it's
the
focus
of
social
activity,
and
my
impression
is
that
that's
what
school
football
games
are
in
texas.
there's
very
little
of
the
instructional
involved
in
it.
it
is
a
community
exercise.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
bet
you
there
are
even
people
who
go
to
those
games
who
don't
have
any
kids
in
the
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
social
compulsion
is
certainly
not
enough.
i
mean,
in
many
communities
you
could
say,
oh,
all
the
kids
belong...
they're
socially
compelled
to
belong
to
the
boy
scouts.
that
doesn't
render
the
boy
scouts,
you
know,
the
government
for
purposes
of
what
things
it
can
do
and
can't
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
just
use
social
pressure
alone
as
the
justification.
