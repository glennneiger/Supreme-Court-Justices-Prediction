we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-62,
the
santa
fe
independent
school
district
v.
jane
doe,
et
al.--
mr
sekulow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sekulow.
general
cornyn,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
shortly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
cornyn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
griffin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
the
district
court
have
authority
to
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
threat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
district
court
just
has
complete
discretion
to
grant
anonymity
that
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
their
names
ultimately
were--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
so
strange
that
an
attorney
would
want
to
press
a
particular
decision
the
way
his
clients
wanted
to
go
as
far
as
it
could
be
pressed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
the
present
policy,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i'm
curious
to
know
why
you're
going
into
these
antecedent
details
when
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
on
is
the
present
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
does
that
bear
on
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
that
if
you
say
extracurricular
but
you
have
to
be
in
class,
that's
not
the
same
as
going
to
a
football
game.
nobody
has
to
go
to
a
football
game.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
more
important
in
the
eyes
of
lots
of
people
than
classes,
but
is
different
in
that
nobody...
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
nobody
is
required
to
go
to
a
football
game?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
say
students.
students
who
are
not
in
the
band
or
on
the
team.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
griffin.
mr.
sekulow,
you
have
3
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
[laughter]

justice

of
the
court

no.

santa
fe
independent

district
