mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
santa
fe
independent
school
district
has
adopted
a
neutral
policy
which
simply
permits
student
led,
student
initiated
speech
at
football
games.
the
policy,
which
can
be
found
in
its
entirety
at
pages
104
and
105
of
the
joint
appendix,
allows
for
the
individual
student
to
determine
the
content
of
the
message.
that
message
may
include
a
prayer
at
the
student's
discretion.
the
policy
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause,
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
the
santa
fe
policy
creates
a
venue
for
student
expression.
it
is
neutral
as
to
religious
or
secular
speech.
the
policy
serves
the
important
and
legitimate
goals
of
solemnizing
the
event,
promoting
good
sportsmanship
and
student
safety,
and
establishing
the
appropriate
environment
for
competition.
in
fact--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
it's
similar
to
the
topical
restriction
that
you
would
see
in
a
limited
public
forum
case,
a
rosenberger,
for
instance,
in
the
situation
there,
where
it
had
to
be
related
to
educational
mission.
clearly--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
would
think
the
school
district--
[laughter]
i
think
the
school
district
would
have
the
authority,
and
that's
more
of
a
bethel
v.
fraser
question
than
an
establishment
clause
issue.
i
think
under
normal
school
district
authority
they
can
control
the
nature
of
what's
going
to
be
said
in
that
regard.
the
policy
also
specifically
states
that
it
can
be
utilized
to
establish
the
appropriate
environment
for
competition.
clearly,
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
not,
but
that
would
be
a
neutral
criteria
applied.
it
would
not
be--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--we--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
i
think
that
in
a
situation
like
that
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate,
if
the
student
felt
that
was
going
to
create
the
appropriate
environment
for
competition,
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
speech.
this
is
a
broad
policy.
it's
not
this
limited
policy
here.
for
instance--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no,
i--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--solemnization
is
bringing
about
respect,
honor,
and
dignity,
and
a
secular
invocation,
even,
could
take
place.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
religious,
but
a
secular
solemnized
message--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--let
every
one
here...
i
ask
everybody's
participation
for
student
safety,
and
let's
encourage
good
sportsmanship.
that's
an
invocation.
that's
petitioning
for
assistance.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
even--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--first,
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
and
the
respondents
bear
the
burden
here
of
establishing
that
there's
no
basis
upon
which
the
policy
can
be
implemented
in
a
constitutional
way.
secondly,
there's
an
independent
circuit
breaker
here.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
hail
mary
would
probably
be
appropriate.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
that's
correct,
and
the
context
upon
which
this
policy
arose
was
after
the
decision
in
lee
v.
weisman
litigation
in
this
case
arose,
this
school
district,
pursuant
to
a
district
court
order,
adopted
a
policy
which
was
actually
broader
than
the
district
court's
order,
and
here
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
individual
student
selected,
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
decision
to
have
a
student
give
a
message,
that
that
student
is
the
circuit
breaker.
that
student
determines
the
message.
there
is
no
way
to
know
what
that
student's
going
to
say.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes,
justice.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
sure.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
there's
two
responses--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
there
is
not
a
majority
vote
on
prayer
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
way
that
the
structure
is
set
up,
the
individual
student
determines
content
and,
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
approach
here,
that
individual
student
will
make
the
decision
whether,
in
fact,
to
include
a
secular
message
or
a
religious
message.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
district
court...
and
this
policy
came
out
of
the
context
of
a
district
court
order,
which
specifically
stated
that
there
would
be
no
campaigning
allowed
on
campus.
now,
that
was
implemented
by
the
district
court
judge
and
served
as
the
basis--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--sure
it
could,
certainly,
but
again
there
is
an
independent
speaker
here,
and
that
is
the
student
and
no
one
knows,
whether
they
campaigned
or
not,
what
that
high
school
student
might
say,
and
i
think
specifically
to
strike
this
policy
down
requires
that
the
establishment
clause
now
place
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
school
district
to
censor
only
the
religious
message
of
the
student
and
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
that
would
be
a
different
case,
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
that's
the
policy
that
the
district
court
issued
and
that
is...
the
order,
rather,
that
the
district
court
issued.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
it
would
be...
again,
as
long
as
it's
a
neutral
criteria--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
i
suspect
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--as
long
as
there's
a
neutral
criterion.
here--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--there
was
a
chaplain.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
regarding
the
specific
content
of
the
prayers
under
this
policy,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
really
about--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--it
could
have
been.
that
was
up
to
the
individual
student.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
school
district
has
taken
a
hands
off
approach
here.
if
it's
individual
student
speech...
in
mergens,
the
opinion
there
focused
on,
and
again
it
was
mentioned
in
rosenberger,
that
there's
a
crucial
difference
between
the
government
as
a
speaker
and
a
private
speaker,
and
in
lee
v.
weisman,
justice
kennedy,
the
context
there
was
the
assumption
that
the
state
was
the
speaker.
the
state
ordered--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
we
stay
neutral.
this
school
district
has
adopted
a
hands
off
policy.
the
policy
itself
states,
on
page
104
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
student
volunteer
who
is
selected
by
his
or
her
classmates
may
decide
what
message
or
invocation
to
deliver.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
the
history
is
relevant
only
in
this
context,
that
before
there
was
the
decision
lee
v.
weisman,
school
districts
like
this
one
and
others
around
the
country,
there
was
prayer
going
on
and
speeches
going
on
in
sporting
events,
or
at
sporting
events
and,
in
this
particular
case,
this
school
district
is
trying
to
comply
with
this
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
by
adopting
a
neutral--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
i
think
the
question
first
would
be
whether
the...
a
school
district
would
have
the
authority
to
call
a
general
election.
i
suspect
not.
secondly,
again
if
it's
a
neutral
criteria--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
it's...
it
would
depend...
it's
too
late
in
the
day
to
argue
that
facts
and
circumstances
don't
have
an
impact.
of
course
it
would,
and
i
think
in
that
particular
case
it
would
depend
whether
the
policy's
neutral.
this
policy
allows
the
student
to
participate,
to
continue
to
have
participation
throughout
the
process.
they
could
also
vote
not
to
have
a
message
under
this
policy.
the
school
district
was
operating
under
the
context
of
litigation,
where
there
was
a
district
court
order
that
specifically
stated,
adopt
a
prayer
only
policy
pursuant
to
a
fifth
circuit
decision,
jones
v.
clear
creek.
this
school
district--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
ginsburg,
students
and
adults
and
members
of
the
community
vote
throughout
both
the
student's
academic
life
and
when
they're
an
adult,
and
i
think
if
a
school
district
was
trying
to
inculcate
the
idea
of
a
democratic
society
and
participation,
that
it
would
encourage
a
student
voter.
the
question
about
whether
the
adults
could
vote,
i
think
if
there
was
authority
assuming
that
they
could
vote,
as
long,
again,
as
it's
a
neutral
policy
and
a
neutral
practice,
that's
what--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
correct,
and
in
southworth
the
concern
was
the
issue
of
viewpoint
neutrality
in
regard
to
majoritarian
vote.
here,
the
viewpoint
neutrality
is
expressed
in
that
the
individual
student
is
the
speaker,
and
there
is
no
majoritarian
vote
under
this
policy.
this
is
a
plurality.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
i
think--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--there
would
be
very
serious
first
amendment
issues.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
neutrality...
sorry.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
i
think
the
ultimate
circuit
breaker
exists
here
even
under
this
election
context,
and
that
is,
the
independent,
individual
student
who
decides
to
make
the
message,
if
they're
selected
by
their
peers,
determines
the
content.
i
think
we--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think,
justice
souter,
this
is
a
policy
that
this
school
district
adopted
utilizing
a
neutral
criteria.
we're
presuming
that
we
know
what
the
students
are
going
to
say.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
okay.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
okay.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
souter,
in
lee
v.
weisman
your
concurrence,
footnote
9,
states
that
if
there
is
a
neutral
policy
and
the
student...
and
the
speaker,
not
a
state
actor,
engages
in
speech
of
their
own
choice,
that
even
if
it's
religious,
it
doesn't
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
then
we're
left
with--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
that...
if
the
student
decides
to
engage
in
a
prayer,
that
is
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
to
then
say
that
a
policy--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--we
think
not.
the
student
doesn't
become
a
state
actor.
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
all
speech
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
that
the
school
district
would
be
placed
in
the
position
of
censor
if
they
were
to
determine
that
that
was
not
going
to
be
allowed.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
it
has...
with
respect,
justice
souter,
has
everything
to
do
with
it,
because
it
requires
the
affirmative
obligation
to
censor
the
student's
speech.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
this
policy
has
never
been
applied,
never
been
implemented.
there
is
not
a
religious
speech
exception
to
the
first
amendment.
the
idea
that
a
student
in
a
talent
show
would
be
told,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
sing
john
lennon's
song,
imagine,
but
another
student
would
not
be
able
to
sing
amazing
grace
is
censorship.
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
that
there
is
an
affirmative
obligation
to
censor
only
one
type
of
speech,
even
if
it
was
just
a
message
policy.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
in
that
context,
the
equal
access
act
was
triggered
if
there
was
only
one
noncurriculum
related
student
group,
so
the
fact
that
it's
one
speaker--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
that
one
student,
that
one
student
determines
the
content
of
their
message.
there
is
no
majoritarian
vote
here
on
the
content
of
the
message.
the
disclaimer's
in
the
policy.
it
states
on
page
104
that
the
student
volunteer
who
is
selected
determines
the
content
of
the
message.
that
is
private
speech.
to
make...
to
have
these
individual
students
become
government
speakers...
and
that's
what
this
would
require,
that
an
individual
student,
selected
by
her
peers,
determines
to
give
a
content
of
a
message,
say
a
nonprayer,
just
talks
about
the
importance
of
sportsmanship,
that
student
message
would
be
okay.
but
if
that
same
student
the
next
week,
or
the
next
home
football
game,
were
to
give
a
prayer--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
i
would
say
this
is
a
facial
challenge
and
that
would
be
an
as
applied
challenge,
and
there
would
have
to
be
empirical
evidence
that,
in
fact,
there
was
forum
domination.
but
here
again,
though,
this
is
individual
student
speech,
and
even
if
there
was
one
student
speaker,
that
student
made...
the
first
week
of
the
home
football
game
give
a
secular
message,
and
the
next
week
a
prayer,
there's
no...
the
student
is
the
circuit
breaker
here,
and
the
important
issue
in
our
view
is
that
in
fact
you
were
to
have
this
policy,
which
does
protect
a
message
and/or
invocation.
to
strike
it
down
requires
there
be
an
affirmative
obligation
to
censor
a
student
speaker,
and
that
would
be
because
the
student
speaker
might--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
court's
referring
to
the
ward
litigation
and
interesting,
there,
the
school
district
was
actually
sued
because,
in
trying
to
comply
with
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision,
they
adopted
a
guideline
that
said,
message
only,
and
specifically
stated
that
there
would
be
no
religious
message
being
allowed
to
be
given
at
all,
and
a
district
court
judge
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
saying
that
that's
viewpoint
discrimination,
which
is
exactly
our
point.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
