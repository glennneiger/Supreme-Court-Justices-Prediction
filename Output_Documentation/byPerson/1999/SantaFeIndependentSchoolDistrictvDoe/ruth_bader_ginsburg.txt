restraints,
are
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
a
little
more
precise
and
constrained
than
that,
is
it
not?
for
example,
could
the
message
be,
break
their
necks,
make
them
wrecks,
buckle
down,
boys?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
would
it
comply
equally
well
if
the
school
district
said,
now,
football
is
a
big
event
in
this
school
district
and
everybody
comes
to
the
game
friday
night,
so
we
want
to
have
everybody,
all
the
registered
voters...
there
are
more
adults
than
the
school
students.
they
are
interested
in
what's
going
on.
the
electorate
will
be
the
registered
voters,
and
then
there
will
be
people
who
come
forward
as
volunteers,
same
thing.
just
substitute
for
the
student
body
of
the
high
school
the
electorate
of
the
district.
would
that
be
equally
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whoever...
the
school
district
says,
we
would
like
this
to
be
as
democratic
as
possible,
so
we
want
to
use
the
democratic
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
i
don't
think
that...
perhaps
i
didn't
convey
clearly
enough
what
i
meant.
registered
voters,
i
think
you
shied
away
from
that,
because
that
sounds
like
the
government
designating
the
electorate.
here,
too,
the
student...
these
are
not
students
acting
individually
when
they're
voting.
it's
the
students
as
a
body,
as
an
electoral
body
that
the
school
district
has
designated
that
will
be
the
decision
maker.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
cornyn--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
neutrality,
may
i
ask
you,
that's
been
repeated
by
mr.
sekulow
and
you.
in,
i
think
it
was
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
rosenberger,
he
defined
neutral
criterion
this
way.
he
said,
there
must
be
good
reason
to
believe
that
over
time
the
criterion
will
yield
expression
reflecting
the
whole
spectrum
of
political
speech.
so
if
you're
going
to
assert
on
a
facial
challenge
that
you
have
a
neutral
criterion,
what
reason
is
there
to
believe
in
this
case
that,
over
time,
what
we
will
see
as
a
result
of
the
policy
the
state
has
initiated,
that
there
will
be
the
full
spectrum
of
speech
resulting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
would
have
an
as
applied
challenge,
and
in
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--very
case
the
language,
as
you
pointed
out,
is
message
or
invocation.
suppose
all
that
the
policy
said
was
message
and
dropped,
or
invocation.
could
you
maintain
a
facial
challenge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can
never
purge
the
past.
if
you
put
even
a
policy
that
looks
like
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
religion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
stressing
the
importance
of
football,
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
making
a
distinction
between,
say,
dramatic
plays,
other
assemblies
that
might
be
less
popular
in
the
community.
would
you
say
that
this
policy
would
be
all
right
if
it
were
limited
to
school
concerts,
school
dramas,
any
place
where
the
schoolchildren
are
assembled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
is
only
one
speech
under
the
policy
that
the
school
board
has
adopted.
that's
why
you're
bringing
in
all
the
cases
where
the
religious
group
was
one
among
many.
here,
whoever
speaks,
it's
just
one
speaker.
no
one
else
can
talk.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
there...
there's
another
to
have
equal
access.
here,
there
isn't.
it's
one
alone.
it's
not
one
among
many.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
under
this
policy
it
turned
out
that
every
speech
was
an
invocation,
including
of
the
deity,
then
what
would
you
say
about
an
as
applied
challenge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
student
speaker,
at
least
on
this
record
that
we
have,
and
we
have
a
brief
to
that
effect,
says,
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
disguise
what
i'm
doing.
i
want
to
say
a
prayer,
and
that's
what
i'm
going
to
do.
in
fact,
didn't
she
even
sue
to
establish
her
right
to
say
a
prayer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
switching
from
the
point
that
i
was
making.
isn't
it
somewhat
imaginary
to
say,
we
have
to
wait
when
we're
told,
i'm
going
to
be
honest
about
it.
i
want
to
give
a
prayer,
not
some
message.
