mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
july
of
1996
there
was
a
hearing
held
in
the
district
court
in
galveston,
texas.
in
that
hearing,
the
court,
the
district
court,
took
testimony
and
part
of
the
testimony
came
from
the
dogs,
as
they're
affectionately
known,
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
one
parent
is...
one
parent,
one
group
of
plaintiffs
were
catholic,
a
catholic
family.
another
group
of
families
were
a
mormon
family.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
i
think
the
jurisprudence
is,
if
there
is
a
threat
of
intimidation,
if
there's
a
threat
of
violence,
if
there's
a
threat...
and
i
think
there
was
testimony
that...
within
the
temporary
injunction
when
the
case
first
started
that
there
was
this
threat,
and
the
district
court
had
entered
an
order
instructing
not
to
ferret
out
the
names,
and
when
there
was
an
attempt
to
ferret
out
the
names--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--well,
he
had
an
attempt...
he
had
the
authority
to
protect
the
plaintiffs,
in
other
words,
from
any
threat.
the
names
of
the
plaintiffs
were
known
to
the
defendant.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
the
threat
was,
we
had
information
that
certain
children
were
intimidated,
certain
children
were
pushed,
certain
plaintiffs,
certain
people
who
were
not
plaintiffs
had
to
pull
their
children
out
of
the
school
because
of
protesting
the
prayer
policies
that
existed
in
santa
fe,
and
that
there
was
a
intimate
threat
that
the
district
court
saw
it
necessary
to
protect.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
i
don't
think
the
district
court
has
the
complete
discretion,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
issues
that
we
briefed
at
the
trial
court
below
was
that
issue,
and
when
we
got
to
the...
into
the
hearing
of
july
of
19
and
96,
the
district
court
said,
now
that
we're
going
into
a
hearing,
these
names
must
be
revealed,
but
we
will
do
it
under
protection.
he
did
not
seal
that
courtroom.
he
asked
the
press
not
to
publish
their
names,
but
their
names
ultimately
became--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--yes.
their
names
ultimately
became
known
to
the
public
and...
but
they
were
not
published
in
the
newspaper,
and
in
this
hearing
one
of
the
most
fundamental
things
that
happened
in
the
hearing
after
the
district
court
had
gone
through
the
problem
of
the
injunction,
after
the
district
court
had
instructed
not
to
ferret
out
the
names,
after
the
court
had
heard
testimony
in
terms
of
intimidation,
the
district
court
looked
at
the
plaintiff,
known
as
susan
doe
in
the
record,
and
he
asked
her,
what
is
the
big
deal?
and
she
looked
at
the
court
and
she
said,
i
teach
my
children
at
home
religion,
and
i
don't
want
to
go
down,
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
go
down
to
the
school
and
interview
every
one
of
the
teachers
and
find
out
their
religious
faith.
that's
the
backdrop
of
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
policy
of
santa
fe
independent
school
district
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
it's
also
unconstitutional
as
applied.
it
endorses
religion,
its
whole
purpose
was
religion,
and
what,
in
fact,
they
do,
they
weave
a
web,
and
they
seek
to
have
this
court
ignore
their
history.
on
page
94
of
the
joint
exhibit,
joint
appendix
of
this
court,
it
has
the
chaplain
policy
that
existed
long
after
lee
v.
weisman
and
if
my
memory
serves
me
well,
lee
v.
weisman
was
decided
in
1992.
this
lawsuit
was
brought
in
1995,
and
that
chaplain's
description,
that
official
description,
says
that
he
will
lead...
he
or
she
will
lead
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
that
he
or
she
will
say
a
prayer
at
all
meetings,
not
just
some
meetings,
all
meetings,
that
he
or
she
will
lead
the
prayer
at
football
games
and
baseball
games,
or
athletic
events,
and
in
the
joint
stipulations
that
the
parties
filed--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
a
good
point,
but
one
of
the
things...
we
oftentimes
speak
to
our
lawyers,
and
one
of
the
things
we
cited
in
our
briefs
was,
the
lawyer
for
santa
fe
admitted
to
the
district
court
that
lee
v.
weisman
had
not
been
extended...
excuse
me.
jones
had
not
been
extended
to
football.
in
other
words,
the
fifth
circuit
had
allowed
graduation...
had
allowed
graduation
prayer
in
a
limited
context,
and
the
court
said,
how
about
football,
and
counsel
admitted,
well,
it
hasn't
been
extended,
but
we
want
to
press
it
as
far
as
we
can
press
it.
that's
the
admission
of
their
lawyer.
now,
even
if
it's
not
extended--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--it's
strange
in
this
context,
that
you
have
a
official
policy
that's
still
in
existence
in
1996,
1995
that
defines
a
chaplain
to
do
prayer
at
all
events
and
all
meetings,
and
that's
a
student
officer.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
well,
it
changes,
and
if
i
can
address
the
court's...
what,
in
fact,
occurred,
chief
justice,
what
in
fact
occurred
is,
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
school
district
then
said,
let's
conduct
a
vote
to
determine
whether
there's
prayer,
in
other
words,
majoritarian
vote.
they
vote
even
before
the
change
of
the
policy.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
well,
they
then
changed
the
policy,
and
they
changed
the
policy
in
september
of
1995,
and
in
september
of
1995
they
changed
it
to
read,
prayer...
excuse
me.
the
board
has
elected
to
allow
an
invocation,
and
then,
once
they
looked
at
the
policy
once
more,
and
i
know
this
court
has
instructed
us
not
to
take
the
caption
of
a...
an
act
to
make
a
determination
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
caption
of
the
act
said,
prayer
at
football
games.
the
meaning
of
the
act,
when
you
look
at
the
very
words,
when
they
are
modified
in
september
of
1995,
they
included
the
board,
which
is
government
only
involvement,
had
elected
to
allow--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--an
invocation.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
two
reasons,
your
honor.
if
we
go
to
the
amendment
in
february
of
1996,
the
present
policy,
that
present
policy
was
changed
to
include
the
words,
message
and/or
invocation.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
well,
two
points.
there
were
existing
policies
in
existence
at
the
school
district
that
allow
silent
prayer.
there
was
existing
policies
in
the
school
district
that
allow
people...
the
students
to
express
their
religious
beliefs.
there
were...
there
was
no
need
for
to
basically
isolate
prayer
and
give
it
a
free
pass,
and
that's
what
those
present
policies
did.
answering
the
chief
justice's
question
directly,
i
don't
think
we
can
divorce
ourselves
from
the
history
and
the
context
of
this
policy.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
yes.
it's
majoritarian
prayer.
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
no.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
on
it's
face,
it's
majoritarian
prayer,
that
in
fact
the
school
board
comes
in--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--they
can.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
and
they
can
elect
to
give,
they
can
elect
a
person
to
give
a
prayer
for
the
next
10
years
who
will
not
give
a
prayer.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
well,
we...
well,
may
i
address
that,
justice
scalia?
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
okay.
i
will
attempt
so.
it
doesn't
open
the
forum.
it
doesn't
create
a
diversity
of
views.
it
doesn't
create
a
circumstance
where
a
student
can
stand
up
and
say,
you
know,
religion,
to
borrow
the
words
of
justice
souter,
religion
is
bunk.
there's
nothing
in
the
face
of
this
policy
that
allows...
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
has
admitted
as
much.
he
has
stood
before
this
court
and
said,
well,
if
it's
outside
the
realm,
we
can...
the
student
can
still
be
disciplined.
there
are
still
governmental
problems.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
student
initiated
prayer
in
my
mind
has
it
that
if
i
have
a
different
faith,
or
faith,
i
can
pray
before
the
football
game,
i
can
pray
after
the
football
game,
i
can
even
pray
during
the
football
game.
in
other
words...
but
i
don't
need
the
government's
forum.
i
don't
need
to
hold
the
government
hostage
and
say,
i
have
an
absolute
right
to
take
over
the
microphone,
to
take
over
the
stage.
you
have
to
let
me
speak.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
that's
not
the
concept--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--it
depends
on,
justice
kennedy,
what
the
policy
would
say.
if
it
says,
you're
chosen
by
lot
to
give
a
message
and/or
invocation,
absolutely
right,
the
policy
still
fails.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
tougher
question.
i
think
they
can...
they...
if
they're
chosen
by
lot
to
give
the
school
a
good
name,
then
i
think
that's
a
tougher
question.
it
may
be
an
as
applied
case.
in
other
words,
we
look
at
the
history
and
see
how
it's
applied.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
i
think
oftentimes
when
there's
disaster
people
bond
in
their
churches.
i
think
oftentimes
people
express
their
religious
beliefs.
in
fact,
under
the
current
policies
in
the
stipulations,
and
i
think
it
was
tab
9,
the
policies
allowed
for
expressing
religious
beliefs.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
subject
it
to
a
majority
vote,
majoritarian
vote,
and
then
say
that's
a
neutral
policy.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
i
still
think
that
it's
problematic.
i
think
that's
also--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--i
think,
in
borrowing
this
court's
language,
this
court
oftentimes
has
said
that
we
look
at
the
particular
facts
of
a
case.
we
would
want
to
know,
for
example,
is
this
directive
consistent.
it
is
the
same--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--yes.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
i've
thought
about
that,
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
address
it
this
way.
you
can
still,
in
my
way
of
thinking,
maintain
a
facial
challenge
even
if
it
just
says
message,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
that
we
face
in
terms
of
the
facial
challenge
is,
i
don't
think
we
can
divorce
ourselves
from
the
history
and
the
context
of
what's
going
on.
if
that
speech
is
given
at
the
same
time,
if
it's
given
at
the
same
time
that
the
chaplain
gave
his
speech,
everyone
understands
what's
going
on
there.
everyone--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--i
think
you
can
purge
the
past.
i
would
never
say
that,
and
chief...
excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
never
say
that.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
oftentimes
looked
at
pretext.
in
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
described
this
policy,
even--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--and
i
know
it
sounds
strange,
but
i'm
willing
to
say
that
yes,
you
can
maintain
a
facial
challenge
even
if
they
took
away
the
word,
invocation--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--because
if
it's--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--if
it's
given
at
the
same
time,
if
it's
given
under
the
same
policy,
if
everything
is
consistent
with
the
past
policy,
the
court
is
entitled
to
look
at
that,
and
when
you
look
at
the
words
of
this,
it
is
subject
to
a
vote,
the
issue
of--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--i'd
still
have
a
problem
with
it.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
i
would
still
have
a
problem
with
it.
i
would
not
have
a
problem
if
it
was
a
diversity
of
views.
i
would
not
have
a
problem
if
it
opened
the
forum
up
consistent
with
mergens,
consistent
with
lamb
chapel,
and
opened
the
forum
up
to
create
a
diversity
of
views.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
it
gives
both--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--by
lot,
by
grade
point
average,
by,
you
know--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--yes,
and
there's
another
problem
with--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--okay.
may
i--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--there's
another
problem,
though.
there
has
been
a
description
that
this
is
an
extracurricular
activity.
it
doesn't
take
a
creative
genius
to
start
the
first
part
of
the
day
with
the
notion
that
the
first
part
of
class
is
extracurricular.
the
first
15
minutes
of
every
day
we're
going
to
have
extracurricular.
we
pass
a
policy
that
says,
wink,
wink,
students,
you
understand,
we're
going
to
have
a
message.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
they
conduct
a...
excuse
me.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties,
chief
justice,
there
has
been
a
description
of
football
where
they
deminimize
football.
one
of
the
amicuses
says
football
is
football
in
texas.
we
supported
the
amicus
and
said,
football
is
football.
the
district
court
said,
football
is
awfully
more
important
in
texas.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
the
band,
chief
justice,
is.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
one
of
our
plaintiffs
was
a
band
member.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
students
who
are
not
in
the
band,
the
cheerleaders,
anyone
who
supports
the
team.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
when
you're
a
teenager,
yes.
[laughter]
and
that's
spoken
from
experience.
in
the--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--but
there's
not
minimum
guidance
in
this
policy,
and
i
understand
the
court's
dilemma,
but
there's...
in
this
policy
itself,
they
admit,
even
though
when
speaking
to
the
court...
the
policy
itself
admits
that
there
is
guidance.
they
not
only
set
the
forum
up,
they
have
interaction
of
the
principal,
who
gives
direction
on
the
election.
as
the
attorney
general
says,
if
the
speech
is
improper,
we
can
still
discipline.
that
is
not
minimal
guidance.
that
is
not
a
diverse
forum,
and
if
you
look
at
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
at
no
point
in
time
do
they
tell
this
court
what
type
of
forum
it
is.
i
don't
see
any
words
saying
it's
a
limited
forum.
i
don't
see
a
word
saying
it's
a
public
forum,
because
what,
in
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
said
was,
it
was
a
sham,
and
the
only
way
that
you
make
it
anything
other
than
a
sham
is,
you
have
to
ignore
you're
electing
one
speaker
to
speak
at
all
the
games
on
a
majority
vote,
and
the
fifth
circuit
not
only
called
it
a
sham,
it
said
the
only
way
you
can
do
it
is
put
your
tongue
in
cheek
and
ignore
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
in
reading
this
court's
opinions,
it
has
admonished
we
in
the
public
that
this
area
of
law
is
not
necessarily
consistent,
in
other
words,
straight
across
the
line.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
and
that's
acceptable.
i
think
that's
acceptable,
and
it's
acceptable
to
this
degree.
i
think
that
the
debate
that
goes
on
in
congress
is
a
little
bit
different.
now,
we
can
take
notice
that
in...
with
respect
to
the
chaplain,
even
though
it's
part
of
a
legislative
act,
they've
had
this
same
debate.
that's
how
divisive
religion
oftentimes
becomes
in
the
forum,
that
when
they
seek
to
nominate
a
chaplain
who
was
someone
other
than
protestant,
all...
everything
broke
loose.
[laughter]
and
it
became
part
of
the
debate.
now,
i
recognize
that
it
is
not
a
straight
line
consistency,
but
i
think,
and
i
will
submit
to
the
court
this
posture
is
prudent
with
respect
to
secondary
schools
has
been
consistent.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
and
i
would
never
say
that.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
absolutely.
when
we
drive
down
the
street,
we
pray
to
our
god.
it's
part
of
our
idiom.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
schools
are
different.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
because--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--absolutely.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
anyone--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--because
children
need
that
type
of
protection.
children,
the
school
district
works
as
a
parent.
this
court's
case
law,
for
example,
in
discipline
cases
oftentimes
says
that
these
children
can
be
disciplined
because
they
work
as
parents,
and
they
don't
have
the
same
rights
as
an
adult.
that's
clear.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
with
due
respect
to--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--with
due
respect
to
your
honor,
athletic
events
serve
a
tremendous
function
throughout
this
country.
it
teaches
leadership.
it
teaches
following
rules.
it
teaches
following
the
rules
of
the
game.
it
teaches
sportsmanship.
they
serve
a
tremendous
function.
they're
just
as
part
of
that
school
as
any
other
event.
and
when
they
put
on
the
side
of
that
stadium
the
santa
fe
indians,
when
they
invite
folks
in,
and
they
bus
them
in
through
those
buses,
when
the
principal
and
everyone
else
shows
up,
and
there's
a
social
pressure
that
you've
got
to
go
to
the
football
game,
and
when
we
idolize
football
players
to
such
a
degree
that
they
obtain
special
rank
in
our
schools,
absolutely,
they're
part
of
the
school
system,
as
well
as
the
pep
rally
that
we
hold
during
the
school,
before
we
ever...
if
a
major
game
is
coming
up,
there's
a
pep
rally,
and
we
let
everybody
out,
and
we
go
idolize
our
football
game.
so
i
respectfully
disagree
that
with
respect
to
football,
football
is
football,
and
it
is
part
of
our
system.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
no,
i
would
not
say
this
policy
would
be
all
right
under
drama
or
any
other
play,
or
any
other
circumstance
and
the
reason
is,
it
still
should
apply
to
football
as
well
as
baseball,
as
well
as
drama,
is
because
there's
still
that
pressure.
when
we
get
those
slips
to
tell
us
that
we
have
to
spend
extra
money
to
buy
a
uniform
for
our
child
that
we
don't
want
to
go
to,
we're
compelled
as
parents
because
our
school
districts
expects
it
of
us,
so
it
applies
across
the
board.
this
court
has
said--
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
--i
agree.
mr.
anthony
p.
griffin
and
i
have
not
attempted
to
do
that.
i
have
attempted,
justice
scalia,
to
address
your
concern
that
football
was
somehow
different
and
it
was
outside
the
realm
of
the
regular
function,
the
classroom,
and
that
we
can
somehow
say,
well,
since
it's
football,
let's
just
let
them
pray,
let's
let
them
do
anything
they
want.
and
there's
not
a
school
district
in
this
country...
they
would
cringe,
and
the
administrators
would
cringe
if
i
as
a
lawyer
stood
up
in
front
of
a
board
and
said,
you
know
what,
this
is
football,
they
should
be
able
to
do
anything
they
want,
and
i
think
that's
what
i
was
attempting
to
address.
this
court
has
said
that
we
should
not
ever
subject
the
right
of
free
speech
and
press
and
fundamental
rights
of
liberty
and
property
to
a
vote,
and
it
should
not
depend
on
the
outcome
of
a
vote.
this
court
has
also
said
in
southworth
that
majoritarian
vote
is
simply
not
viewpoint
neutral,
and
this
whole
notion
that
somehow
this
becomes
viewpoint
neutral
as
we
change
the
words
from
chaplain
to
message...
excuse
me,
to
invocation,
and
then
message
or
invocation,
is
to
put
our
heads
in
the
sand
and
ignore
the
culture
and
the
historical
phenomenon
of
what
is
happening
in
santa
fe,
texas.
it
has
been
my
honor.
i
thank
the
court.
