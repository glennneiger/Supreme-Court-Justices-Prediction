justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
about
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--mr.
sekulow,
and
to
conserve
your
time
i'll
just
state
my
concern--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--rather
than
ask
a
series
of
questions.
i
assume
that
the
election
is
offered
to
us
as
a
saving
feature
of
the
program,
yet
an
election
doesn't
mean
anything
without
a
campaign,
and
if
we
had
a
campaign
it
seems
to
me
that
the
students
might
say,
i
will
be
a
very
good
speaker,
representative
of
the
school,
because
i
am
well
trained
and
well
motivated
to
give
inspirational
prayers.
another
student
has
a
poster
saying,
no
prayers
in
school,
and
they
have
a
school
election,
based
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
prayer.
now,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing,
i
think,
that
our
establishment
clause
wants
to
keep
out
of
the
schools.
we
have
a
school
electoral
mechanism,
a
governmental
mechanism
for
selecting
a
speaker,
and
one
of
the
criteria
is,
i
should
think,
whether
or
not
prayers
are
going
to
be
given.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if...
and
i'll
just
finish.
and
if
it's
not,
then
it
seems
to
me
we're
just
avoiding
the
question,
and
the
hard
question
is,
can
you
give
a
prayer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
the
student
goes
to
the
community
as
the
representative
of
the
school,
i
should
think
we
would
want
to
have
some
ongoing
supervision
by
the
regular
faculty.
we
should
encourage
students
to
go
out
into
community
affairs.
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the
faculty
ought
to
do
if
they
are
selecting
the
speaker
and
if
five
members
are
sitting
around
on
a
faculty
committee,
do
we
encourage
this
young
person
to
give
prayers
or
don't
we?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
question
we
ought
to
answer
in
this
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
can.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
have
too
much...
in
southworth
we'd
already...
our
predicate
was
there'd
already
been
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights,
and
this
was
just
a
corrective,
and
here
the
whole
question
is,
ab
initio,
what
are
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
rights
of
this...
it
seems
to
me
what
we're
concerned
about
is
avoiding
the
schools
becoming
a
forum
for
religious
debates,
and
one
thing
we
could
do
is
say,
it
is
unconstitutional,
illegal
to
say
a
prayer
at
all.
never.
this
is
a
very
costly
intervention
when
the
school
seeks
to
go
out
into
the
community.
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
election
thing
doesn't
work,
for
the
reasons
i
suggested
and
that
justice
ginsburg
has
been
asking
you
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
would
be
yes,
it's
completely
sufficient.
we
don't
know
how
this
policy
is
going
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
nobody
will--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
you
can't
try
your
case
or
argue
the
case
that
way.
on
the
other
hand,
for
this
court
to
take
individual
school
districts
and
say
that
we
don't
accept
at
face
value
what
their
policy
is
puts
us
on
a
very
difficult
course
for
later
cases.
i
take
it
that
even
if
this
school
district
had
had
no
prior
history
of
the
type
you
describe,
that
you
would
object
to
this
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you
would
say
that
even
if
these
speakers
were
chosen
by
lot,
and
they
were
widely
representative
speakers
on
a
statistical
basis,
that
if,
by
chance,
one
out
of
five
were
giving
prayers,
that
it
would
be
an
unlawful
exercise
one...
that
one
fifth
of
the
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
chosen
by
lot
to
represent
the
school
and
give
the
school
a
good
name.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'd
like
to
know
just
a
little
bit
about
that.
in
justice
scalia's
example,
where
you
want
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there's
been
an
accident
where
team
members
have
been
killed,
or
some
terrible
tragedy
is...
it
would
seem
to
me
very
odd
not
to
have
an
invocation
in
that
circumstance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
even
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
students
chosen
by
lot,
then.
a
rotation
of
students.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
course
of
the
year,
180
students
could
speak.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
had
the
180
students...
well,
it
wouldn't
be
180.
if
you
had
a
student
a
week
at
every
football
game,
given
the
choice
to
speak
at
the
time
the
invocation
used
to
occur,
you
would
have
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
context
is
everything.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
part
of
the
problem
is
that
it's
very
important
for
kids
to
have
school
activities
after
hours.
that's
when
they
keep
out
of
trouble,
their
advisors
are
close
hand,
at
close
hand,
and
what
we
seem
to
be
saying
in
order
to
accept
your
position
is
that
we
want
minimum
guidance
from
the
schools.
that's
somewhat
counterintuitive.
