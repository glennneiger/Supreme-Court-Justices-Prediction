do
you
think
there's
a
first
amendment
problem
in
a
rule
that
prohibits
campaigning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would
be
rather
strange
to
be
relying
on
such
a
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
this
question,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
it
in
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
person
who's
elected
gives
the
solemnizing
invocation
for
every
football
game
at
home,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whatever
it
is,
but
repeated
messages,
so
that
if
the
school
disapproved
of
the
first
message
that
the
person
gave,
the
person
could
continue
to
give
the
same
message
over
and
over
again?
say
he
used
foul
language
in
his
message,
for
example.
could
they
tell
him
not
to
do
that
next
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
supposing
he
made
an
appeal
to
one
particular
denomination.
say
90
percent
of
the
people
in
school
were
mormons,
and
he
made
some
specific
appeal
to
people
of
that
religion,
could
they
suggest
next
time
he
not
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
right
within...
squarely
within
the
language
of
the
policy.
could
they
suggest
to
him
that
maybe
that
had
gone
overboard
a
little
bit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
overtly
sectarian?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
santa
fe
independent
school
district
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
texas
responsible
for
the
education
of
more
than
4000
students
in
a
small
community
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state.
prior
to
1995,
the
santa
fe
high
school
student
who
occupied
the
school’s
elective
office
of
student
council
chaplain
delivered
a
prayer
over
the
public
address
system
before
each
varsity
football
game
during
the
entire
football
season.
two
families,
one
mormon
and
other
catholic
brought
this
action,
challenging
that
practice
as
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
in
response
to
their
challenge
the
district
adopted
a
different
policy,
which
authorized
two
student
elections:
the
first
to
determine
whether
“invocations”
should
be
delivered
before
football
games,
and
the
second
to
select
the
student’s
spokesperson
to
deliver
them.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
football
prayer
policy
was
invalid.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
explained
why
we
agree
with
that
conclusion.
eight
years
ago
in
a
case
called
lee
against
weisman,
we
held
that
a
prayer
delivered
by
a
rabbi
at
a
middle
school
graduation
ceremony
violated
the
establishment
clause.
although
the
case
we
decide
today
involves
student
prayer
at
a
different
type
of
school
function,
our
analysis
is
properly
guided
by
the
principles
that
so
we
endorsed
in
lee.
the
government
may
not
coerce
anyone
to
participate
in
a
religious
exercise
or
to
otherwise
act
in
a
way
that
establishes
a
state
religion.
the
district
argues
that
lee
is
not
inapplicable
to
its
football
policy
because
the
messages
are
private
student
speech,
not
public
speech.
we
are
not
persuaded
that
the
pre-game
invocation
should
be
regarded
as
private
speech.
the
invocations
are
authorized
by
a
government
policy,
take
place
on
a
government
property
at
government
sponsored
school
related
events.
although,
the
district
relies
on
many
of
our
cases
involving
government
created
public
forums
for
private
speech.
it
is
clear
that
the
pre-game
ceremony
in
this
case
is
not
a
public
forum.
the
policy
does
not
open
the
pre-game
ceremony
to
indiscriminate
use
by
the
student
body
generally.
rather,
the
school
allows
only
one
student,
the
same
student
for
the
entire
season
to
give
the
invocation.
moreover,
the
district's
selection
system
does
not
create
a
forum
for
a
private
student
speech
because
it
provides
insufficient
safeguards
for
diverse
student
views.
the
majoritarian
process
implemented
by
the
district
guarantees
by
definition
that
minority
candidates
will
never
prevail
and
that
their
views
will
be
effectively
silenced,
thus
placing
the
students
to
hold
such
views
at
the
mercy
of
the
majority.
the
messages
are
also
not
private
speech
because
the
district
has
failed
to
divorce
itself
from
the
religious
content
in
the
invocations.
the
text
of
the
policy
reveals
the
school’s
entanglement
in
both
the
selection
of
the
speaker
and
the
content
of
the
message.
by
its
terms
the
policy
invites
and
encourages
religious
messages.
indeed,
the
only
type
of
message
that
is
expressly
endorsed
in
the
text
of
the
policy
is
an
invocation.
the
term
that
primarily
describes
an
appeal
for
divine
assistance
and,
as
used
in
the
past
at
santa
fe
high
school
has
always
entailed
a
religious
message.
the
invocation
is
then
delivered
to
a
large
audience
assembled
as
a
part
of
a
regularly
scheduled,
school
sponsored
function
conducted
on
school
property.
regardless
of
the
listener
support
for
or
objection
to
the
message,
an
objective
santa
fe
high
school
must
perceive
the
pre-game
prayer
has
stamped
with
her
school
the
seal
of
approval.
the
history
of
this
policy
beginning
with
long
sanctioned
office
of
“student
chaplain”
reinforces
the
perception
that
the
prayer
is
in
actuality
encouraged
by
the
school.
thus,
the
delivery
of
such
a
message
is
not
properly
characterized
as
private
speech.
the
district
argues
that
attendance
of
the
commencement
ceremonies
that
were
reviewed
in
lee
against
weisman
differ
significantly
from
attendance
at
high
school
football
game.
this
argument
overlooks
the
importance
to
many
students
of
attending
and
participating
in
popular
extra-curricular
activities
that
are
part
the
complete
educational
experience.
the
constitution
does
not
permit
a
school
district
to
exact
religious
conformity
from
a
student
as
the
price
of
joining
her
classmates
at
a
varsity
football
game.
of
course
by
no
means
does
the
first
amendment
impose
a
prohibition
on
all
religious
activity
in
our
public
schools.
nothing
in
the
constitution
as
interpreted
by
this
court
prohibits
any
public
school
student
from
voluntarily
praying
at
any
time
before,
during
or
after
the
school
day.
but
the
religious
liberty
protected
by
the
constitution
is
abridged
on
the
state
affirmatively
sponsors
the
particular
practice
of
prayer.
finally,
the
district
argues
repeatedly
that
the
respondent’s
facial
challenge
to
the
most
recent
policy
is
pre-matured.
this
argument
however
assumes
that
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
constitutional
injury
that
occurs
when
a
student
is
forced
to
participate
in
an
active
religious
worship
if
he
chooses
to
attend
the
school
event.
but
the
constitution
also
requires
that
we
keep
in
mind
other
ways
in
which
establishment
clause
values
can
be
eroded.
here
the
mere
passage
of
the
policy
that
constitutes
government
establishment
of
religion
along
with
the
implementation
of
an
electoral
process
that
subjects
the
issue
of
prayer
to
a
majoritarian
vote
are
also
constitutional
violations.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
