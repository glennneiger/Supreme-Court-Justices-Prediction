then
what
does...
just
tell
me...
maybe
this
is
not
important,
but
what
is
it,
what
would
it
be
to
solemnize
a
football
game?
i
thought
at
least
it
would
require
religion,
or
require
religious
messages
to
sound
religious,
and
you
say
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
solemnization
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
a
secular
invocation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
a
nice
speech,
but
it's
not
what
we
normally
mean
by
invocation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
of
the
problems,
it
seems
to
me,
with
your
case,
and
one
of
the
problems
with
the
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
it
assumes
that
this
language,
which
we
see
on
the
face
of
the
policy
now,
is
descriptive
of
what,
in
fact,
is
going
on.
and
i
will
be
candid
to
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
asking
us
to
shut
our
eyes
to
what
the
sequence
of
provisions
for
this
practice
shows,
and
the
sequence
of
provisions
shows
that
we
started
out
with
a
student
chaplain
and
an
invocation
and,
after
the
lawsuit
was
brought,
the
student
chaplain
became
a
speaker,
and
the
invocation
gained
the
alternative
of
a
noninvocation,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
isn't
a
very
realistic
basis
to
suggest
that
anything
different
is
going
on,
or
intended
to
go
on,
from
what
went
on
and
was
intended
to
go
on
before
the
lawsuit.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
on
a
facial
challenge,
we
are
not
required
to
close
our
eyes
to
the
context
in
which
the
language
has
come
to
be.
we
don't
wait
for
a
specific
application,
e.g.,
a
hail
mary.
i
guess--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
we
don't
wait
for
that,
but
we
don't
close
our
eyes
to
the
context
in
which
the
policy
arose.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
mr.
sekulow,
even
if
we...
and
i'm...
because
of
my
first
question
i
don't...
i'm
sure
you
will
understand
i
don't
find
that
enough
of
an
answer.
but
assuming
it
is,
if
the
student
who
is
chosen
exercises
that
student's
choice
to
pray,
we
are
still
faced
with
a
system
in
which
it
is
the
school
or
the
school
district
that
provides
the
forum
in
which
this
is
going
to
appear,
requires
the
attendance
of
a
certain
number
of
students
to
be
there
and,
therefore,
requires
those
students
to
sit
there
while
a
prayer
is
going
on.
what
more
do
we
need
to
decide
the
establishment
clause
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
assuming...
i'm
assuming
for
the
sake
of
the
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
the
criterion
will
be
accepted
as
neutral.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
taking
it
to
the
next
step,
and
i'm
saying,
if
the
student
who
is
given
this
neutral
option
chooses
to
use
that
option
to
pray,
the
school
district
is
forcing
schoolchildren
to
sit
there
and
participate
in
this
praying
ceremony.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
as
far
as
we
have
to
go
to
decide
the
case,
even
on
your
premise.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
talking
here
not
about
a
neutral
choice
to
engage
in
kinds
of
speech.
that
was
going
on,
for
example,
in
rosenberger.
i
didn't
accept
the
characterization,
but
that
was
the
court's
characterization
of
it,
and
that's
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
not
a
neutral
speech
policy.
the
premise
of
my
question
is
that
we
are
not
having
a
discussion
about
religion.
it
is
not
merely
religious
subject
matter.
it
is
religious
worship.
it
is
an
act
of
religious
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
private
speech.
the
question
is
whether
that
speech
can
be,
in
effect,
involuntarily
inflicted
upon
those
who
may
not
want
it
by
the
power
of
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's
assume
that
they
stay
on
topic
and,
taking
justice
ginsburg's
question
as
limited
to
that,
i
think
she's
asking
a
factual
question,
not
a
question
about
precedent
but
a
question
about
fact,
what
could
be
expected,
and
let
me
just
add
a
footnote
to
her
question.
is
there
any
reason
that
anyone
would
expect
that
we
would
get
a
solemnizing
speech
to
the
effect
that
religion
is
bunk?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question
is,
do
we
have
reason,
if
we're
going
to
apply
this
definition
of
neutrality,
and
assuming
it's
appropriate,
do
we
have
reason
to
believe
that,
over
time,
that
kind
of
a
spectrum
of
expression
on
religious
subjects
is
going
to
occur
here,
and
i
mean,
the
point
of
my
question
is,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
expect
that
there's
going
to
be
a
speech
at
those
football
games
saying
religion
is
bunk.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
