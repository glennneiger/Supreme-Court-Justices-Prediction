would
it
not...
rather
than
an
establishment
clause
problem,
what
if
somebody
chose
to
speak
on
the
subject
that,
all
religion's
bunk?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
does
that
comport
with
the...
i'm
not
sure
what
solemnizing
a
football
game
is,
but
assuming
there
is
such
a
process--
[laughter]
--would
that
comport
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
do
we
do
about
the
history?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
soon
as
it's
in
place
once
and
they
give
one
prayer,
then
the
case
is
back.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
your
basic
substantive
argument.
i
mean,
that
was
the...
i
understand
that.
is
there
any...
i
mean,
there
are
prayers
in
public
places,
they're
called
invocations,
in
congress,
here,
at
the
inauguration
of
the
president
and
so
forth,
and
i
gather
that
in
texas
this
is
a
big
community
event,
but
i
take
it
no
one
is
saying
that
for
that
reason
they
could
have
an
invocation
of
god's
name.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
you're
not
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what's
worrying...
look,
from
an
establishment
clause
point
of
view,
this
is
a
mechanism.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
school
district
has
figured
out
a
way
to
have
a
prayer,
but
the
mechanism
itself
seems
to
leave
minority
religions
out
more.
i
mean,
instead
of
a
general
prayer,
you'd
have
something
that
reflected
the
majority
view,
which
is
understandable,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the...
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
bad
speech.
i
am
saying,
though,
that
wouldn't
the
minority
person
be
likely
more
left
out
under
the
policy
that
you
advocate
today,
that
even
under
a
policy
that
said
some
kind
of
nondenominational
prayer
like
an
invocation
was
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
the
purpose
of
the
establishment
clause
is
to
allow
families
to
raise
their
children
in
the
religion
of
their
choice,
and
we
have
schools
favoring
one
religion
over
another,
and
giving
that
kind
of
message,
isn't
that
very
contrary
to
the
purpose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
but
your
answer,
i
take
it...
i
think
your
answer
would
be
different
if
the
school
in
order,
in
its
view,
to
comply
with
lee
and
weisman
ended
the
practice
of
football
prayers,
and
then
at
some
time
later,
maybe
even
simultaneously,
enacted
a
new
policy
that
at
2:00
every
afternoon
in
the
school
5
minutes
will
be
given
over
during
a
break
between
periods
for
an
elected
student
to
give
any
message
that
the
student
wanted,
would
you
find
that
that,
the
5-minute
message
statement,
would
equally
be
susceptible
to
a
facial
challenge
on
establishment
clause
grounds?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is...
why...
can
i...
i
don't
what
to...
if
you're
finished
with
this,
because
i've
a
different
question
i
wanted
to
ask.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
thought
that
there
are
certain
public
events
where
you
can
have
a...
call
it
solemnizing,
or
i
don't
know
the
word
to
use
to
describe
it,
but
you
can
invoke
god's
name...
say
the
inauguration,
say
the
meeting
of
the
court,
say
congress
sessions.
certain
public
events,
you
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
right
on
the
point
i'd
like
you
to
address,
because
whether
it's
a
straight
line
or
a
crooked
line,
or
whatever
the
line
is,
you
agree
there
is
a
line,
and
my
question
is,
why
doesn't
high
school
football
fall
on
the
permissive
side
of
the
line
rather
than
the
impermissive
side?
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
focus
on.
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anything
associated
with
a
school
is
more
likely
to
be
on
the
impermissible
side
of
the
line,
even
if
it's
extracurricular
and
a
community
event?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
