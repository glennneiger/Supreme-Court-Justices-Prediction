but
the
point
of
the
question,
of
course,
is
that
there
may
well
be
a
campaign
among
students
to
be
chosen
and,
if
that's
the
situation,
then
how
do
you
respond
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
justice

but
it
could
be
off
campus.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
had
a
case
decided
just
this
term
dealing
with
submitting
to
student
election
the
participation
and
use
of
student
fees
for
certain
purposes
and
expressed
some
concerns
about
that
mechanism,
didn't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
is
through
the
mechanism
of
the
school
organizing
a
majoritarian
vote
to
determine
it,
which
is
a
very
unusual
sort
of
an
arrangement.
i
don't
think
we've
addressed
anything
like
that
before.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
if
this
mechanism
is
approved
here
the
same
thing
could
be
done
in
every
classroom
every
day,
and
let
the
students
decide
each
day
on
a
speaker
for
the
day
to
start
the
class
and
so
forth.
i
think,
you
know,
we
have
to
look
at
the
extended
application
of
this
concept.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
the
school
had
no
stated
policy
but
did
allow
the
captain
of
the
team
before
every
game
to
get
up
and
say
something,
and
suppose
the
captain
on
occasion
says
something
in
the
nature
of
a
prayer,
is
that
somehow
invalid?
