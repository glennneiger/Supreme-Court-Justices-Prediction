mr.
john
cornyn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
ask
this
court
to
simply
assume
the
worst
of
the
school
officials
involved
and
of
the
students
who
will
ultimately
be
the
speakers
under
this
policy,
which
has
yet
to
be
applied
because
its
application
has
been
suspended
while
this
litigation
goes
forward.
we
submit
that
under
the
standard
of
review
of
a
facial
challenge
that
respondents'
burden
is
heavy
to
show
that
it
could
never
be
constitutionally
applied,
and
we
believe
this
school
district,
just
as
in
agostini,
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
that
school
officials
will
faithfully
discharge
their
duties
according
to
the
law,
as
laid
down
by
this
court.
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
conclusions
offered
by
the
respondents
that
this
is
somehow
a
sham,
or
a
pretext.
indeed,
the
trial
court
below
found
that
any
incidents
which
gave
rise
to
this
litigation
were
isolated
incidents.
mr.
john
cornyn
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
this
policy
is
one
which
the
school
officials
attempted
to
come
up
with
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
lee
v.
weisman,
in
light
of
the
controlling
fifth
circuit
precedent,
at
least
that
the
district
court
felt
was
controlling.
jones
v.
clear
creek,
they
were
trying
to
work
their
way
out
of
a
very
practical
problem.
how
do
we
avoid
getting
sued
for
establishment
clause
violations?
how
do
we
avoid
getting
sued
for
a
violation
of
the
free
speech
clause?
mr.
john
cornyn
i
misspoke
if
that
was
my
answer.
i
did...
i...
excuse
me.
i
did
misspeak,
then.
we
believe
this
policy
does
pass
muster
under
a
facial
challenge,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
choice
is
ultimately
going
to
be
by
the
student,
the
selected
speaker.
there
is
no
way
that
respondents
or
anyone
else
can
predict
how
the
student
chosen
through
this
neutral
mechanism
is
ultimately
going
to
respond
to
this--
mr.
john
cornyn
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
and
let
me
just...
unless
the
court
is
going
to
say
the
school
district
must
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination--
mr.
john
cornyn
--well,
the
only
reason
we
believe--
mr.
john
cornyn
--that
this
policy
is
constitutional
is
because
it
is
neutral
with
regard
to
the
message.
mr.
john
cornyn
of
course,
this
facial
challenge,
the
policy
that
has
yet
to
actually
be
applied,
we
can
only
be
left
to
speculate,
but
let
me
suggest
that
in
bethel
v.
fraser,
matthew
fraser,
who
was
disciplined
for
making
a
sexually
explicit
speech
when
nominating
a
fellow
student
for
student
council,
was
later
elected
by
his
peers
to
speak
at
the
graduation
ceremony,
and
i
think
respondent's
argument
is
really
just
wrong
in
that
it
assumes
what
the
nature
of
the
speech
will
ultimately
be,
the
criterion
upon
which
the
student
will
be
selected.
mr.
john
cornyn
under
cornelius
and
other
cases
by
this
court
the
school
officials
can
keep
the
students
on
topic
for
the
purpose
for
which
the
opportunity
to
speak
is
allowed,
but
solemnization--
mr.
john
cornyn
--i
just
don't
think
any
of
us
know,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
should
have
to
guess.
mr.
john
cornyn
respectfully,
your
honor,
we
just
don't
know,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
cornyn
--your
honor,
in
a
world
where
free
speech
is
valued,
where
private
free
speech
is
valued,
we
are
all
inundated
by
messages
we
disagree
with
and
find
ourselves
in
a
minority
status
from...
on
a
daily,
perhaps
hourly
basis.
mr.
john
cornyn
respectfully,
justice
breyer,
i
disagree.
this
is
not
the
government
speaking.
this
is
a
private
individual
speaking
as
a
matter
of
their
own
volition
and
free
choice.
mr.
john
cornyn
justice
o'connor,
of
course,
as
this
court's
observed,
there
are
always
going
to
be
interaction
between
school
officials
and
religious
expression,
and
it's
impossible
to
totally
separate
the
two.
this--
mr.
john
cornyn
--we
certainly
do
not
submit
that
this
could
occur
in
the
classroom
which,
as
the
court
observed,
risks
the
appearance
of
government
entanglement,
and
with
compulsory
education
requirements
and
the
like.
this
is
an
extracurricular
event.
mr.
john
cornyn
yes.
mr.
john
cornyn
message
or
invocation.
mr.
john
cornyn
yes,
sir,
they
could.
they
could,
justice
stevens.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
they
can...
that
the
school
officials
can
maintain
good
order
and
make
sure
that--
mr.
john
cornyn
--if
it
was
not
on
topic--
mr.
john
cornyn
--may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
john
cornyn
it
would
be
impermissible
for
school
officials
to
edit
or
censor
the
content
of
the
speech,
as
long
as
it
was
on
topic.
mr.
john
cornyn
as
long
as
it's
on
topic,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
cornyn
thank
you.
