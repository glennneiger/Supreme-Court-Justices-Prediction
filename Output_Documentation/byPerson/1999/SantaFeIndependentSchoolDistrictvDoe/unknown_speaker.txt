now,
if
we
don't
adopt
that
wooden,
rigid
rule,
then
we
still
are
looking
for
some
mechanism
to
ensure
neutrality,
to
keep
divisiveness
out,
and
i
haven't
seen
what
it
is
in
this
case.

that
may
be
a
weakness
in
rosenberger,

in
small
communities

really
not
all
that
different
from
the
inauguration,
frankly.
[laughter]
they're
big
public
events,
and
so
if
you're
trying
to
draw
a
line,
cut
through
all
this
and
just
say
it's
not
like
a
graduation,
it's
a
big
public
event,
and
it's
exactly
the
same
