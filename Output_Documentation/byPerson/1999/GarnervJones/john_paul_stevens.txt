justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
on
your
view?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
would
say
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
if,
instead
of
changing
the
system
which
had
an
initial
hearing
after
7
years
and
subsequent
hearings
every
3
years...
now
they
changed
it
to
an
8-year
interval.
it
would
have
been
okay
simply
to
say
after
your
first
hearing,
no
more
hearings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
more
hearings
unless
the
board
decides
to...
of
its
own
motion,
no...
no
more
routine
hearings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
my...
my
example.
would
that
be
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not...
not
the
board.
i'm
asking
you
about
a
rule.
the
new
rule
is
just
like
the
one
we've
got
except
and
instead
of
saying
they're
entitled
to
a
hearing
every
8
years,
they
say
they're
not
entitled
to
any
hearing
unless
the
board
decides
to
grant
them
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
under
that
view,
since
it's
a
board
imposed
rule,
they
could
simply
say,
we'll
give
you
one
hearing
and
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
always
change
their
mind
and
adopt
a
new
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
was
accomplished
by
the
change
to
8
years
then?
did
they
accomplish
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn't
they
do
that...
why
couldn't
they
do
that
under
my
hypothetical?
no
more
automatic
review.
no
review
unless
we
decide
in
a
particular
case
we
want
to
have
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
never
foreclose
discretion
because
if
you...
you've
explained...
the
very
heart
of
your
argument
i
think
is
that
the
board
has
ultimate
discretion.
it
made
the
rules.
therefore,
it
could
change
the
rule
tomorrow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
relying
on
the
policy
statement
that
was
issued
in
1996?
justice
john
paul
stevens
first
answer
my
question.
are
you
relying
on
that
policy
statement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
my
second
question
is,
was
it
in
effect
at
the
time
he
had
his
first
parole
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the...
the
respondent
has
misrepresented
the
facts
on
page
2
and
3
of
his
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wait
a
minute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
going
pretty
fast
and
i'm
kind
of
slow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
1996
policy
didn't
change
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
they
issue
the
1996
statement
if
it
didn't
change
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
that
policy
of
extraordinary
reconsideration?
does
that
mean
that
any
time
a
prisoner
says
i'd
like
a
hearing,
he'll
get
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
triggers...
what
triggers
that
kind
of
a
decision
by
the
board?
it
can't
be
triggered
by
an
application
by
the
inmate.
what
else
would
trigger
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
it
do
it
on
its
own
initiative?
the
board
goes
out
and
examines
what's
going
on
in
the
prison
population
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
it
in
fact
do
that?
is
that
what
you're
telling
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
inmate
has
been
released
at
one
of
these
intermediate
inmate
requested
hearings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
1999,
which
was
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals...
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1999,
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
later
on
they...
there
are
some
of
these.
but
before
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
inmate
had
been
released
pursuant
to
an
inmate
requested
interview
that
was
not
on
the
automatic
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
prevent
you
from
putting
in
such
evidence,
if
it
existed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
disagree
with
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the...
you
called
our
attention
to
the
material
at
the
appendix
to
their
reply
brief.
i
notice
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
in
january
of
1999.
and
i
notice
that
every
one,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
of
these
reconsiderations
was
after
january
of
1999,
each
of
those
in
the
appendix.
do
you
think
there's
any
causal
connection
between
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
those
statistics?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
if
there
are
any
reconsiderations
comparable
to
these
before
january
1999?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
policy
statement
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
decision
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
decision
concerning
this...
this
inmate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
the...
you
heard
your
opponent
argue
today,
were
you
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a...
the
1996
policy
statement
was...
really
repeated
something
that
had
been
long
in
effect?
