ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
understand
why
the
retroactive
application
of
georgia's
8-year
rule
does
pose
a
significant
risk
to
inmates
of
increased
confinement,
i
think
it
is
important
to
first
focus
on
the
facts
of
the
system.
and
there
are
a
number
of
facts
about
this
system,
none
of
which
are
disputed
by
petitioners,
that
really
illustrate
where
the
risk
is
inherent
in
the
system.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
in
georgia
consideration
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
to...
to
parole
release.
if
an
inmate
is
not
considered
for
parole
or
reconsidered
for
parole,
that
inmate
will
not
be
released
on
parole.
second
of
all,
we
know
that
in
georgia
when
the
board
considers
or
reconsiders
an
inmate
for
parole,
the
board
makes
not
one
but
two
determinations.
the
first
determination
is
whether
that
inmate
is
entitled
to
parole
today,
and
the
board
is
correct,
that
over
that
determination
they
have
broad
discretion.
but
the
board
also
makes
a
second
determination
that's
the
determination
that
we're
talking
about
today,
and
that
is
what
is
the
maximum
possible
interval
that
should
take
place
between
the
present
consideration
and
the
next
one.
and
it
is
that
determination
that
is
the
problem
here.
in
georgia,
these--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--mr.
chief
justice,
you're
correct
that
they
do
have
discretion
over
the
number
of
years,
but
that
discretion
is
limited
by
the
maximum
number
of
years
that
they
can
defer
the
decision.
under
the
3-year
rule,
they
can
set
the
next
consideration
any
time
during
that
3
years,
but
must
set
it
at
least
within
the
next
3
years.
under
the
8-year
rule,
they
have
discretion
to
add
an
additional
5
years
onto--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--your
honor,
the
board
created
the
rules.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
i
believe
so
if
that's
applied
retroactively--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--as
opposed
to
prospectively.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
the
board...
i
believe
the...
the
governor
appoints
the
board
members
to
serve
7-year
terms.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
no,
not
to
appoint
a
tough
parole
board,
but
to
change
the
policies
retroactively
in
a
way
that
would
pose
an
increased
risk
of
confinement--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--there
is
a
distinction,
your
honor.
that...
that
distinction
is
under
the
hypothetical
you
proposed,
you
may
have
a
less
receptive
board,
but
you
still
have
a
board
that
is
going
to
consider
you.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction,
and
the
distinction
is
in
this
case
the
board
is
depriving
the
inmates
of
the
ability
to
present
their
case
to
the
board
altogether,
and
that's
a
very
different
situation.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
i
think
there's...
i
don't
believe
that
that's
a
meaningful
process
that's
an
adequate
substitute
for
an
automatic
consideration.
and...
and
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
i'd
like
to
say
about
this
exceptional
review
process
that
the
board
relies
so
heavily
on.
first
of
all,
that
process
is
not
in
the
rules.
it's
only
in
a
policy
statement.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
it
made
a
very
significant--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i...
i
apologize.
the
difference
is
that
the
board
is
bound
to
follow
its
rules.
it's
not
bound
to
follow
its
policy
statements
and,
in
fact,
has
argued
in
cases
such
as
sultenfuss
that
the
policy
statements
are
completely
unenforceable.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
i...
i
think
it
makes
a
significant
difference
because,
first
of
all,
inmates
can
enforce
the
rules.
second
of
all,
the
rule
itself
tells
the
inmates
what's
going
to
happen.
the
existence
of
a
policy
statement
that's
not
published
with
the
rules,
that
can
only
be
obtained
by
going
through
the
board
and
asking
for
it,
really
shows
that
inmates
are
not
going
to
have
a
good
opportunity
to--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--i
think
it
does
because
the
petitioners
have
relied
so
heavily
on
this
as
a
substitute
for
automatic
consideration.
we
know
that
inmates
are
entitled
to
automatic
consideration
under
the
3
and
8-year
rules.
providing
a
substitute
of
exceptional
reconsideration
changes
the
equation
dramatically.
it
puts
a
burden
on
the...
on...
on
the
prisoners
to
articulate
persuasively
to
the
board
why
they
think
they
should
get
the
consideration
that
they
would
have
been--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--i...
i
think
it's
important
because
i
think
we
need
to
consider
whether
or
not
that
inmates
will
be
able
to
take
meaningful
advantage
of
this
process.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
well,
i'm
not
sure
the
court
has
specifically
addressed
anything
like--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--well,
i
still
think
it's
relevant
to
the
determination.
we
need
to
look
at
whether
or
not
this
system
provides
inmates
with
a
way
of
minimizing
the
risk
that
if
they're
deprived
of
their
3-year
considerations,
that
they'll--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
your
honor,
again,
i...
i
think
that
that's
a
very
different
question--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--well,
it's
true--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--my
client...
my
client
is
entitled
to
be
considered.
and
parole...
it
may
be
an
act
of
grace
and
it
may
be
a
decision
over
which
this
board
has
a
lot
of
discretion,
but
parole
is
no
less
a
part
of
the
inmate's
sentence
because
there's
discretion
inherent
in
that
decision.
this
court
has--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--your
honor,
i...
i
think
the
source
of
that
entitlement
is
because
my
client's
sentence
carries
with
it
the
right
to
be
considered
for
parole.
there's
a--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--well,
we
can
start
from
the
proposition
that
there's
a
very
big
difference
between
a
life
sentence
and
a
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole.
if
you
accept
that
those
two
sentences
are
different
and
that
the
board
could
not
retroactively
change
a
life
sentence
into
one
without
possibility
of
parole--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--that
the
inmate
is
entitled
to
have
his
first
consideration
after
7
years
and
is
entitled
to
automatic
reconsiderations
thereafter
at
a
period
of
time
that
the
board
shall
define.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
the
board
defined
it
prior
to
1985
as
3
years.
after
1985,
it
changed
it
to
8.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct.
and...
and
the...
the
legislature
does
tell
the
board
that
it
has
to
have
periodic
reconsiderations
after
an
initial...
initial
denial
of
parole.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct.
the
statute
does
require
the
board
to
set
reconsiderations
at
intervals
that
it...
it
can
determine.
so--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
board's
discretion
is
significantly
more
limited
than
they
have
portrayed
it
to
this
court.
they
do
have
discretion
over
the
ultimate
determination
of
whether
an
inmate
should
be
paroled,
but--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the...
the
issue
is
what...
is
not
whether
they
can
prospectively
change
those
intervals.
it's
going
back
to
retrospectively
whether
or
not
by
changing
those
intervals,
the
statutes
pose
an
increased
risk
of
confinement.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
i...
i
think
it's
very
significant,
your
honor.
it's...
it's
certainly
significant
to
my
client
and
to
the
other
70
percent
of
inmates
who
are
being
deferred
over
such
a
long
period
of
time
on
a
very
cursory
review.
what
the
board
is
doing
here
is...
is
predicting
over
an
8-year
span
of
time,
based
solely
on
a
review
of
the
inmate's
files,
that
there's
no
way
that
the
inmate
will
become
suitable
for
parole
in
the
meantime.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
a
separate
case,
had
already
addressed
that
issue
and
it
found
that
these
rules
do
have
the
force
of
law
in
the
state
of
georgia.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
certainly.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
all
right.
we'll
start
with
argument
number
three.
argument
number
three
involves
some
of
this
new
evidence
that
the
board
has
submitted
in
connection
with
its
reply
brief.
and
i
do
need
to
remind
the
court
that
my
client
was
pro
se
at
the
court
below,
moved
for
leave
to
conduct
discovery,
and
was
denied.
the
board
filed
an
early
motion
for
summary
judgment.
so,
my
client
has
never
had
the
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
from
the
board
and
to
get
the
kind
of
statistical
evidence
that
justice
breyer
is
talking
about.
but--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--well,
i
think...
i
think
we
have
got
some
very
good
and...
and
concrete
evidence
of
why
these
determinations
are
important,
and
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
gary
newberry.
you'll
find
a
summary
of
his
case
at
the
appendix
page
4
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
newberry
is
1
of
these
10
inmates
who
somehow
secured
this
exceptional
reconsideration
process
that
the
board
relies
so
heavily
on.
we--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--it's...
it's
attached
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
appendix
page
4.
we
don't
know
why
mr.
newberry
got
this
exceptional
consideration.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
it's
not
in
the
record
below.
it's...
it's
something...
it's
new
evidence
that
the
board
has
gotten
from
its
own
files
that
we've
never
had
the...
the
opportunity
to
review.
but
i
think
it...
it
illustrates
exactly
why
this
system
does
pose
a
risk
to
inmates.
we
don't
know
why
mr.
inmate
got
this
exceptional
review,
but
what
we
know
about
him
is
he
was
first
considered
for
parole
in
january
1996.
at
that
time
the
8-year
rule
was
applied
to
him.
his
next
year...
his
next
reconsideration
was
set
a
full
8
years
later
for
january
of
2004.
something
happened
to
mr.
newberry,
and
3
and
a
half
years
later,
he
somehow
managed
to
secure
this
exceptional
reconsideration.
he
was
reconsidered
in
july
of
1999,
and
at
that
point
the
board
found
that
he
was
suitable
for
parole
and
released
him
at
that
time.
and
what
i
see
in
the
case
of
mr.
newberry
is
a
situation
in
which
if
mr.
newberry
was
suitable
for
parole
in
july
of
1999,
he
might
very
well
have
also
been
suitable
for
parole
in
january
1999,
which
is
when
the
reconsideration
would
have
automatically
taken
place
if
the
3-year
rule
had
been
applied
to
him,
a
full
6
months
earlier.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
my
client
had
also
brought
damages
claims.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
and
i
believe
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
remand,
to
determine
whether
or
not
those
were
appropriate.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that's
correct,
that
it
did
not
have
statistics.
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
thought
that
it
could
look
at
the
system
and
see
risk
inherent
in
the
system.
and
i...
i
think
that
that's
entirely
appropriate
here.
the...
the
court
has
always
said
that
in
ex
post
facto
cases,
you
know,
we
don't...
the
court
has
never
required
statistical
proof.
in
the
latest
case,
martin
v.
haddox,
this
court's
opinion
authored
by...
by
justice
o'connor
said
that
when
we're
trying
to
figure
out
whether
or
not
the
law
should
be
applied
retroactively,
we're
supposed
to
make
a
common
sense,
functional
judgment.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
here.
they
looked
at
the
rules,
used
the
common
sense
to
see
that
there
was
risk
inherent
in
these
rules--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--i
think
the
court--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--addressed
that
when
it
decided
the
morales
case,
and
it
said
there
are
a
lot
of...
of
little
rules
that
we
could
invalidate
under
the
same
theory
if
we
agree
with
the
respondent
in
that
case
who
was
trying
to...
to
advocate
the
court
to
say
that...
that
there
was...
that
any
conceivable
risk,
no
matter
how
attenuated,
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
the
court
in
morales
was
not
willing
to
go
that
far,
and
instead,
the
court
said,
we're
going
to
look
at
see
whether
there's
something
more
than
that,
whether
there's
a...
a
sufficient
risk,
you
know,
a
meaningful
risk.
and...
and
i
think
that...
that
that
provides
a
basis
to
distinguish
those
types
of
procedural
cases.
looking
at
what
the
court
considered
in
morales
i
think
provides
us
with
a
very
clear
contrast
that
can
really
help
us
see
why
there
is
risk
inherent
in
the
system.
in
morales,
the
court
was
looking
at
a
case
that,
because
of
the
procedural
way
these
statute
operated...
the
statutes
operated
and
because
of
the
protections
that
were
given
to
the
inmates
under
that
system,
both
before
the
initial
determination
was
made
and
after,
the
court
was
able
to
say,
with
a
very
high
level
of
confidence,
that
it
was...
that
there
was
no
reason
to
conclude
that
the
amendment
would
have
any
effect
on
any
prisoner's
term
of
confinement.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
because
we
were
never
able
to
conduct
discovery
to
try
to
look
and...
and
see
whether
or
not
any
reconsiderations
were...
were
being
given
prior
to
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case.
but
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
way
the
system
operates,
and
we
can
see
the
risk
inherent
in
it.
and
we
can
contrast
the...
the
way
this
statute
operates
to
the
ones
that
the...
the
court
was
considering
in
morales.
first
of
all,
when
this
board
is
trying
to
predict
over
an
8-year
period
of
time
whether
or
not
an
inmate
is
going
to
become
suitable
for
parole
in
the
intervening
years,
it's
doing
so
on
a
very
scant
review.
it's
only
looking
at
the
inmate's
file.
the
inmate
does
not
get
a
hearing,
does
not
get
counsel.
and
based
solely
on
that
limited
review,
the
board
decides...
you
know,
makes
an
individualized
determination...
that
the
prisoner
will
not
become
suitable
for
parole
during
the
intervening
8
years.
that--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--no,
your
honor.
it
did
not.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
that
has
not
changed,
but
it's
still
important
because
when
you
consider
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
here,
it's
trying
to
predict
basically
an
inmate's
future,
and
the
longer
the
period
of
time
that
the...
the
board
has
to
do
this
over,
you
know,
the...
when
you're
talking
about
a
period
of
time
as
long
as
8
years,
then
i
think
it's
a
harder
question
and
i
think
that
the
board
might
have
to
do
a
little
bit
more
in
order
to
accurately
predict
the
consequences
to
an
inmate
over
an
8-year
period
of
time.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
well,
your
honor,
there...
the
court
has
considered
and
rejected
a
number
of
attempts
to
do
the
same
thing
under
other
scenarios.
the
court
has
never
held
that
you
can
violate
the
constitution
just
because
it's
going
to
be
less
expensive
to
do
so.
in
this
case
the
petitioners
have
not
given
us
any
information
about--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--your
honor,
that
is
sensible,
and
that's
why
it's
appropriate
for
the
board
to
do
this
on
a
prospective
basis.
but
the
court...
the
board
cannot
sacrifice
other
inmates
in
order
to
focus
better
attention--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--well,
your
honor,
and
again
prospectively
i
think
that
might
very
well
make
sense.
but
when
you're
talking
about
retrospective
application
of
this
rule,
by
depriving
these
inmates
of...
of
consideration
over
a
period
of
up
to
5
years,
that
does
pose
a
risk
to
these
inmates
that
if
their
circumstances
change
and
if
during
that
5-year
period,
if
somebody
were
to
look
at
them
and...
and
consider
the
facts
of
their
case,
that
that
board
might
very
well
vote
to
release
them.
by
depriving
them
of
that
consideration,
then
you
have
harmed
the
inmate,
you
have
extended
the
time
period
in
jail.
and
that's...
for
that
reason,
even
if
it
would
be
cost
effective
to
do
that,
we
can't
go
back
retrospectively
and
implement
this
rule
in
such
a
way
that
inmates
will
be
harmed
in
the
process.
going
back
to--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--the
policy
does
say
that
they'll
consider
it.
however,
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
gary
newberry,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you're
going
to
get
the
consideration
and
that
you're
going
to
get
out
at
the
same
time
that
you
would
have
had
the
review
been
conducted
at
the...
the
3-year
interval.
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
your
honor--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--the
date
of
that
policy
is
1996.
my
client's
decision...
my
client
was
considered
in
1994...
5.
the
board
tells
us
today
that
there
was
a
previous
version
of
this
policy
statement
in
effect.
whether
or
not
that's
the
case
or
what
that--
ms.
elizabeth
s.
kertscher
--no,
your
honor,
and
although
counsel
for
petitioners
said
that
came
up
at
the
eleventh
circuit,
that...
that
never
was
addressed
at
the
eleventh
circuit
level.
i'm
willing
to...
to
accept
counsel's
representations
that
there
was
such
a
rule
in
1995
because
this
policy
statement
and...
and
the
ability
of
inmates
to
request
this
expedited
consideration
has
been
shown
not
to
be
a
sufficient
safeguard
to
really
prevent
these
inmates
from
spending
longer
times
in
jail
under
the
8-year
rule
than
they
would
under
the
3-year
rule.
what's
also
noticeably
absent
in
this
system
is
a
safeguard
that
this
court
relied
on
very
heavily
in
the
morales
case,
and
that
was
the
ability
of
the
california
board,
after
the
fact,
to
go
back
and
advance
the
ultimate
release
date
in
the
event
that
there
had
been
an
error
or
some
unforeseen
change
in
circumstances.
and
it...
that
finding
allowed
this
court
to
find
that
there
was
basically
no
way
an
inmate
in
the
california
system
was
going
to
slip
through
the
cracks
and
wind
up
spending
more
time
in
jail
as
a
result.
we
don't
have
anything
like
this
here.
if
the...
if
the
inmate
is
considered
and
found
appropriate...
found
to
be
an
appropriate
candidate
for
release,
then
the
inmate
is
released
at
that
time.
there's
no
opportunity
after
the
fact
to
go
back
and
correct
for
it.
and
if
we
have
an
inmate
like
we
have
with
gary
newberry,
who's
considered
6
months
later
than
he
would
have
been
under
the
3-year
rule,
there's
no
opportunity
to
go
back
and
give
mr.
newberry
or
anybody
like
that
the
6
months
that
he's
lost
under
this...
under
the
application
of
the
new
rule.
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
the
georgia
system
on
its
face
provides
far
too
great
a
risk
for
inmates
to
serve
an
increased
term
of
confinement
under
the
3...
under
the
8-year
rule
than
they
would
under
the
3-year
rule.
we
know
that
in
the...
the
state
of
georgia,
regardless
of
the
precise
number
of
years
of
an
average
life
sentence,
we
know
that
inmates
are
regularly
released
that
are
serving
life
sentences.
last
year
the
board
tells
us
that
they
released
14.4
percent
of
the
life
sentenced
inmates
that
they
considered
under
this
rule.
my
client,
who
is
71
years
old
and
has
served
22
years
in
prison
for
his
crimes,
despite
the
severity
of
his
crimes,
is
entitled
to
the
consideration
that
the
legislature
provided
for
and
entitled
to
a
full
and
fair
considerations
of
all
the...
all
the
relevant
facts
that
might
bear
on
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
he's
suitable
for
parole.
by...
by
pushing
his
determination
back
for
an
8-year
period
when
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
review
every
3
years
under
the
old
rule
my
client
and
others
similarly
situated
to
him
are
at
a
very
significant,
very
meaningful
level
of
risk
of
an
increased
sentence.
and
for
that
reason,
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
