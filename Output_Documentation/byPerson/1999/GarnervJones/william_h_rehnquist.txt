we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
99-137,
j.
wayne
garner
v.
robert
jones.
mr.
brasher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
board...
under
the
procedure
you
describe,
does
it
on
its
own
motion
bring
up
cases
and
say,
well,
the...
we'll
move
this
guy
ahead
or
we'll
hold
this
guy
back?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
if
i'd
want
to
wait
too
long,
if
i
were
the
inmate,
for...
for
the
guard
to
tell
them
that
my
circumstances
had
changed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the...
the
inmate
on
his
own
can
make
an
application.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
a
minute,
mr.
brasher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
extent
are
we
dealing
here
with
information
that
has
been
supplied
in
briefs
by
the...
either
your
side
or
the
other
side
that
wasn't
before
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just...
as
to
the
material
that
you
say
is
before
us
what
wasn't
before
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
is
there
disagreement
between
you
and
your
opponent
as
to
any
of
the
facts
in...
in
that
material?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
so,
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
take
it
you're
familiar
with
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
familiar
with
your
opponent's
brief--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
all
the
filings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
disagreement
between
you
and
your
opponent
as
to
any
factual
matters
that
are
in
that
classification?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
were
individualized
determinations
in
morales
too,
and
we
paid
attention
to
the
statistics
there
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
brasher.
ms.
kertscher,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
board
surely
has
a
good
deal
of
discretion
in
making
that
judgment
too,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
difference...
what
difference
does
it
make?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
not
asking
the
eleventh
circuit.
i'm
asking
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
difference
does
it
make?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does...
does
bear
on
the
ex
post
facto
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no.
that
certainly
can
be
a
part
of
your
ex
post
facto
argument,
but
i
thought
you
were
arguing
because
the
policy
statement
wasn't
readily
available,
that
makes
it
less,
somehow,
of
a
policy
statement.
i...
i
don't
see
why
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
ex
post
facto
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
in
our
ex
post
facto
jurisprudence
any
statement
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
quite
sure
it
hasn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
also
have
determination,
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
to
decide
the
intervals
after
the
7
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
is
this
information
coming
from,
ms.
kertscher?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
reversed
the
judgment
of...
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
had
ruled
against
you
and
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled
in
your
favor.
and
it...
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings,
but
it...
it
decided,
did
it
not,
that...
that
the
georgia
parole
system
was
violating
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
were
the...
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
remand
rather
than
entry
of
judgment
outright?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
take
it
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
could
decide
the
ex
post
facto
question
without
any
more
statistics
than
it
had.
and
i
don't
believe
it
had
much
of
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
what
was...
was
that
procedure
different
when
it
was
a
3-year...
i
mean,
did
the
inmate
get
counsel
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
that
hasn't
changed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
kertscher.
mr.
brasher,
you
have
1
minute
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brasher.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-137,
garner
against
jones
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
