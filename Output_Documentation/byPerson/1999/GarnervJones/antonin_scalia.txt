i
am
really...
i'm
getting
impatient
with
hearing
that
response,
individualized...
it
seems
to
me,
you
know,
the
science
of
statistics
is
based
upon
the
proposition
that
you
could
look
at
a
series
of
individualized
determinations
and
draw
a...
a
general
conclusion
from
the
agglomeration
of
those
individualized
determinations.
now,
do
you
disagree
with
the
science
of
statistics?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
it...
then
it
does
no
good
to
keep
responding
these
are
all
individualized
determinations.
we
know
that.
but
the
fact
is,
when
you
look
at...
at
the
span
of
them
over
a
number
of
years,
you
can
draw
some
generalized
conclusions.
and
if,
before
this
change
was
put
into
effect,
the
individualized
determinations
let
out
50
percent
of
the
lifers
before
their
term
was
up
and
afterwards
it
let
out
only
5
percent
of
the
lifers
before
their
term
was
up,
that
would
be
significant
despite
the
fact
that
they're
all
individual
determinations.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
they
have
discretion.
who
created
these
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
board
itself,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
this
is
unlike
a
system
in
which
you
have
a
board
that's
operating
under
a...
under
a
prescribed
rule
that's
established
by
the
legislature.
presumably
the
same
board
that
said
we're
not
going
to
consider
these
things
automatically
except
at
8-years
intervals
could
have
said,
yes,
we'll...
we'll
let
them
apply
every
8
years,
but
you
know,
we've
been
too
lenient
and
we
are
not...
we're
just
not
going
to
allow
paroles
as
readily
as
we
have
allowed
them
in
the
past.
would...
would
that
have
violated
your...
your
client's
constitutional
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
who
appoints
the
board?
who
appoints
the
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
governor...
you
have
a
law
and
order
governor,
and
he
says,
we
have
a
board
of
paroles
under
my
predecessor
that
was
just
letting...
it
was
just...
you
know,
the
jail...
the
jail
gates
were
open
for
life
termers
to
get
out.
i'm
a
law
and
order
governor,
and
when
i
get
in,
i'm
going
to
appoint
a
tough
parole
board.
and
he
does
that.
he
appoints
a
tough
parole
board.
that
violates
a
prisoner's
constitutional
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
retroactively.
it's...
it's
just
in
the
future.
i
mean,
from
now
on,
we're
just
not
going
to
listen
to
you
every
8
years.
why
is
that
any
different
from
saying
from
now
on
we're
going
to
be
tougher?
we're
not
going
to
let
lifers
out
as...
as
much
as
we
did
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
would
say
my...
mine
is
even
worse.
you
know
for
sure.
i
mean,
you're
just
saying,
well,
there's
less
of
a
chance
that
you'll
get
out.
but
under
my
hypothetical,
it's
for
sure
that...
that
you're
not
going
to
get
out
as
readily
as
you
did
before.
we
are
going
to
be
tougher.
this
board
has
just
said,
well,
you
know,
we're
going
to
let
you
come
and
bring
things
to
us.
we're
just
not
going
to
automatically
reconsider
it
as
often
as
we
used
to.
i...
i
fail
to
see
how
the
one
does
not
constitute
a
violation
and
the
other
one
does.
and...
and
i
certainly
don't
think
the
former
does.
i
think
if
you
want
a
tough
parole
board,
that's
up
to
the
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's...
that's
not
true.
he
can...
as
we've
heard,
he
can
present
the
fact
that
he
has
changed
circumstances
and
say
on
the
basis
of
that,
please
reconsider
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
it
a
risk
or
is
it
an
opportunity
of...
of
grace?
this
is
a
board
not
just
of
paroles,
but
it's
a
board
of
pardons
and
paroles.
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
has
entire
discretion
to
pardon
or
to
parole.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
when
your
client
committed
a
crime,
he
knew
he
was
going
to
get
life,
that...
that
that
was,
you
know,
the...
the
sentence
for
it.
it
seems
to
me
he
goes
to
jail
knowing,
you
know,
i...
i
did
the
crime,
i...
i
do
the
time.
if
i
get
lucky,
someone
will
be
generous
and
give
me
the
grace
of
a
pardon
or,
if
less
than
that,
the
grace
of
a
parole.
but,
you
know,
many
states...
the...
the
pardon
power
resides
with
the
governor.
and
i
ask
you
the
same
kind
of
a
question.
if...
if
the
people
elect
a...
a
hard
nosed
governor
who
says
he's
not
going
to
give
any...
any
pardons
in
the
future,
can
someone
who...
who
committed
a
crime
under
the
previous
bleeding
heart
governor
come
in
and
say,
ah,
constitutional
violation
because
all
of
a
sudden
my
chances
of
getting
a
pardon
are
less?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
different?
parole
is
a
matter
of
grace.
nobody
is
entitled
to
any
parole
just
as
nobody
is
entitled
to
any
pardon
under
this
system,
and
it's
the
very
same
board
that
gives
the
pardon
and
that
gives
the
paroles.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
client
entitled
to?
i...
i
don't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
element
of
discretion
any
more
subject
to
control
by
the
prisoner
than
is
the
more
significant
element
of
discretion,
namely,
whether
to
be
lenient
or
strict
in
the
substantive
decision
of
parole
or
not?
you...
you
can't
seriously
argue...
i
don't
think
you
can...
that...
that
if
you
get
a
tougher
parole
board,
your
client
has
suddenly
been...
been
subjected
to
an
ex
post
facto
law.
that's
just
the
luck
of
the
draw,
you
know.
some
people
happen
to
be
sentenced
with
a
lenient
parole
board.
i
have
a
tough
one.
too
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
because
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
board,
the
substantive
decision
whether
to
release
or
not.
here,
it's
a
much
less
significant
thing
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
board.
how
often
are
we
going
to
automatically
reconsider
this...
this
person?
i
mean,
gee,
compared
to
the
other
one,
this
is
insignificant.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
record
information
or
is
this--
