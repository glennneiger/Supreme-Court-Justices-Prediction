justice

you've
stressed...
it's
really
the
core
of
your
argument...
that
the
board
has
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
look
at
this
case,
initially
you
think,
well,
of
course,
the
inmate
is
better
off
if
the
board
must
exercise
its
discretion
every
3
years
than
every
8.
but
then
your
answer
to
that
is,
well,
what
we're
looking
at
is
risk.
there's
just
no...
very
slight
probability
that
there's
going
to
be
any
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but...
but
then
you
tell
us
that
statistics
are
unimportant.
and
it...
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
defense
that
you
must
make,
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
matter
of
risk.
and
then
you
say,
we're
talking
about
a
matter
of
risk,
but
statistics
aren't
important.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
the
old
rule,
that
discretion
had
to
be
exercised
every
3
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
your...
but...
and
so
the...
the
way
you
get
out
of
that
is
to
say,
well,
it's
not
going
to
make
any
difference.
but
you
give
us
no
statistics.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
way
we
know
what
the
board
is
going
to
do
is
to
see
how...
a,
how
it
exercises
its
discretion
or,
b,
the
statistical
risk
of
its
not
granting
parole
during
the
extended
period.
and
you
say
that
the
latter
is
completely
irrelevant.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
meets
the
gravamen
of
the
question,
which
also
concerns
me.
the
board
has
serious
responsibilities
and
it
says
we'd
rather
have
a
system
in
which
we
take
the
most
likely
candidates
and
look
at
them
and
rather
than
be
required
to
sit
in
routine
hearings
that
are
going
to
amount
to
nothing.
so,
we're
going
to
go
to
an
individualized
determination
in
which
we'll
see
whether
there
is
some
information
that
comes
up
to
us
that
makes
these
people
look
like
they're
really
eligible
for
parole.
that...
that's
sensible
to
me,
and
that
has
to
do
with
risk.
with
risk.
justice
anthony

after
escaping
from
a
georgia
prison
where
he
was
serving
a
life
sentence
for
a
murder
conviction,
the
respondent
committed
a
second
murder;
he
was
apprehended
and
again
sentenced
to
a
life
term.
at
the
time
he
committed
the
second
murder,
the
georgia
law
required
that
respondent
first
be
considered
for
parole
after
seven
years,
and
then
assuming
parole
was
denied
every
three
years
thereafter.
the
parole
board
acting
under
statutory
authority
lengthened
the
interval
between
reconsideration’s
date.
its
new
rule
took
effect
after
the
respondent
was
convicted
and
sentenced.
under
the
new
rule,
parole
reviews
take
place
at
least
every
eight
years.
under
a
policy
of
the
parole
board
however,
a
prisoner
can
receive
early
review
upon
a
showing
of
a
change
in
circumstances
or
upon
the
parole
board’s
receipt
of
new
information
bearing
on
his
suitability
for
release.
in
1995
after
the
parole
board
decided
not
to
consider
him
for
release
for
another
eight
years,
respondent
brought
suit
in
the
federal
court.
he
claimed
that
the
parole
board’s
retroactive
application
of
this
new
rule
violated
the
ex
post
facto
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
respondent
asserted
that
the
less
frequent
parole
reviews
would
result
in
a
lengthened
period
of
incarceration,
and
therefore
that
increased
the
punishment,
a
result
that
is
prohibited
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
district
court
rejected
the
respondent’s
claim;
it
determined
that
the
new
rule
changed
only
the
timing
between
reconsideration
hearings,
thereby
relieving
the
parole
board
of
the
necessity
of
conducting
parole
hearings
for
inmates
with
no
reasonable
chance
of
early
release.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed;
it
relied
upon
differences
between
the
parole
board’s
new
rule
and
the
california
law
sustained
in
our
decision
in
the
department
of
corrections
versus
morales.
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded
that
permitting
an
eight
year
interval
between
parole
review
seems
certain
to
increase
some
inmates
period
of
incarceration.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
no
regard
to
the
parole
board’s
internal
policies
which
do
permit
expedited
reviews
upon
showing
of
changed
circumstances
as
i
have
indicated.
we
now
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings,
a
prisoner
alleging
that
a
law
changing
the
frequency
of
parole
reviews
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause
must
demonstrate
that
the
new
law
creates
a
significant
risk
of
prolonging
his
incarceration.
today’s
opinion
outlines
the
broad
discretion
georgia
law
vests
with
the
parole
board.
our
analysis
rest
upon
the
premise
that
the
board
will
exercise
its
discretion
in
accordance
with
each
inmate’s
likelihood
of
release
between
reconsideration
dates.
respondent’s
personal
circumstances,
is
having
committed
two
murders
well
illustrates
how
the
new
rule
will
enable
the
parole
board
to
put
its
resources
to
better
use;
to
concentrate
on
those
prisoners
having
a
good
possibility
of
early
release.
it’s
difficult
to
see
how
the
board
increased
the
risk
of
respondent
serving
a
longer
time,
when
it
decided
that
his
parole
review
should
be
exercised
after
an
eight-year,
and
not
a
three-year
interval.
yet,
if
such
a
risk
develops,
respondent
may
invoke
the
board’s
internal
policies
to
request
expedited
review.
it
was
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
parole
board’s
policies
were
of
no
relevance
in
the
case.
the
parole
board’s
statements
at
a
minimum
provide
important
instruction
as
to
how
the
board
exercises
its
discretion
in
making
parole
decisions.
respondent
claims
he
is
not
been
permitted
sufficient
discovery
to
demonstrate
a
violation,
and
this
matter
can
be
addressed
on
remand
by
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
as
need
be
by
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join.
