mr.
brasher,
let...
let
me
try
it
another
way.
the
california
statute,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
dealt
with
a
very
small
category
of
people,
double
murderers,
and
the
interval
was
1
year
to
3
years.
here
it's
a
much
larger
group.
it's
anyone
who
gets
life.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
just
take
it
with
people
who...
it
does
cover
people
who
get
life
sentences.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
that
is
a
much
broader
class
than
people
who
commit
double
murders.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it...
we're
dealing
with
a
much
larger
population
and
a
much
longer
interval.
doesn't
it
just
stand
to
reason
that
there
are
going
to
be
people
who
would
have
gotten
out
if
it
were
only
3
years
who
won't
get
out
if
it's
8?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
prisoner's
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then
i
think
mr.
brasher
was
not
correct
in
saying
that
under
the
legislation
the
board
can
simply
say
we
won't...
our
rule
is
that
after
the
initial
7
years,
which
we
must
do
by
legislation,
then
the
rest
is
up
to
us
and
we
can
have
a
rule
that
says
no
automatic
periods.
you
say
under
the
statute
they
couldn't
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it's
a
kind
of
delegation
to
fill
in
the
detail
to
the...
which
is
quite
different
from
saying,
board,
you
have
discretion
to
either
have
intervals
or
not
have
intervals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brasher,
may
i
ask
you...
i
wasn't
clear
on
your
argument
whether
you
were
making
a
distinction
between
a
statute...
say,
a
statutory
change
from
3
years
to
8
years
and
the
rule
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
the
text
of
the
statute
someplace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have

someplace?
