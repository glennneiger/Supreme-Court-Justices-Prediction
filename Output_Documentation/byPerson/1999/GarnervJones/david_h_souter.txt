justice
david
h.
souter
well
that's...
that's
fine
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes,
but
that's
not
the
test
under...
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the...
the
test
is
whether...
whether
there
is
a
so
called
sufficient
risk
that
sentences
will,
in
fact,
be
increased
in
duration
by
the
change.
do
you
agree
that's
the
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
i
understand
it...
you
correct
me
on
the
facts
if
i'm
wrong,
but
as
i
understand
it,
before
the
statutory
change
here,
the
average
sentence
served
by
someone
under
a
life
sentence
was
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
12
years,
12
years
and
some
months.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well,
let's...
let's
take
the
narrower...
let's
take
the
narrower
figure,
as...
as
you
describe
it.
i
also
understand
that,
in
fact,
following
the...
the
change
in
the
statute,
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
about
70
percent
of
those
who
are
given
ultimate
reconsideration
for
parole
are
not
given
it
until
after
8
years,
so
that
we're
talking
about
a
period
of
8
years
that
follows
the
initial
7-year
period.
and,
therefore,
if
anyone
in
georgia,
subject
to
parole
reconsideration,
is
going
to
be
paroled...
and...
and
i
guess
we
can
assume
some
will
be...
those
people
at
least
are
not
going
to
be
considered
for
15
years
as
against
the
12-year
sentence
for
those
who
go...
who
got
parole
on
some
reconsideration
theory
under
the
old
law.
isn't
that
enough
to
say,
yes,
the
risk
of...
of
a
longer
sentence
is
present
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that
matters
one
way
or
the
other.
the...
the
question
under
the
test
is...
is
whether
there
is
a
risk
of
an
increased
sentence,
the
sentence
actually
served.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
follow...
i
think
it
follows
from
those
numbers
that
there
is
such
a
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
what
the
board
can
do,
what
in
fact
is
going
to
happen
is
that
if
those
who
will
be
released
on...
following
a
first
reconsideration,
70
percent
of
those
are...
are,
in
fact,
going
to
wait
for
15
years
as
against
a...
a
prior
scheme
in
which
there
was
an
average
of
12
years.
now,
that
doesn't,
by
any
means,
demonstrate
just
how
many
are
going
to
get
longer
sentences,
but
it
does
demonstrate,
it
seems
to
me,
a...
a
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
does
that...
how
does
that
affect
the
fact
that
there
is
a...
a
demonstration
of
some
increased
risk
or...
or
some
risk
of
an
increased
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless...
i
mean,
the
board...
sure,
the
board
might
act
differently.
the
board
might
reduce
that
risk.
but
all
we've
got
are
gross
numbers,
and
the
gross
numbers
seem
to
support
the
inference
that
there
is
an
increased
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
assumes...
it
assumes...
yes.
it
assumes
that
some
would
have
gotten
out
because
of
the
average
that
existed
before.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
no.
the...
you
corrected
the
average.
we're
taking
the
average
subject
to
the
limitation
that...
that
you
just
told
us
we...
we
should
in
order
to
be
accurate.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
the
numbers...
and
what
the
new
numbers
show
is
that
of
those
who
are
released
on
reconsideration,
there
is
a
70
percent
chance
that
they
will
be
released
only
after
15
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
may
well
do
so,
and
in
point
of
fact,
it
may
do
a
very
good
job
of
it.
but
the
question
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
risk
of
a
longer
sentence,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
numbers
demonstrate
that
there
is
some
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it
doesn't
assume...
it...
it
assumes
necessarily,
from
the
fact
that
there
was
an
average
release
date
of
12-some-odd
years
for
those
who
are
released,
that...
that,
of
course,
some
will
have
gotten
out.
that's
what
the
average
figure
shows.
some
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you...
have
you
given
us...
has
the
state
given
us
any
of
those
numbers
that
you
feel
we
should
look
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true...
that's
true
of...
of
every
application
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
a
parole
eligibility
scheme.
so,
if
that
were
going
to
be
the
answer,
we'd
never
even
be
applying
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
parole
eligibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
with
respect
to
the
numbers,
your
position
is
the
numbers
are
really
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we...
we
have...
but
we
have
a...
we
have
an
ex
post
facto
standard
that
relies
upon
risk
of
increased
sentence.
and
your
position
is
that
the
numbers
are
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
a
second
ago
that
those
who
are...
the
figures
from
which
the
12-year
average
was
computed
showed
that
only
1
percent
of
the
total
prison
population
is...
of
the
total
life
sentence
prison
population
is,
in
fact,
released
before
the
expiration
of
their
lives?
justice
david
h.
souter
their
lives.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
referred
to
1
percent.
what
does
the
1
percent
refer
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
during
that
year.
justice
david
h.
souter
during
that
one
year.
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i...
may
i
interrupt
you
there
and
just
follow
up
on
that?
why
is
your
client...
why
is
the
inmate
entitled
to
be
considered?
what
is
the
source
of
that
entitlement?
justice
david
h.
souter
how?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do...
what
do
the
statutes
of
georgia
say
about
entitlement
to
consideration
for
parole
if
one
has
a
life
sentence
subject
to
parole?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
in...
in
effect,
the
legislature
sets
a
kind
of
minimal
scheme
and...
and
then
it...
i
guess
it's
fair
to
say,
it
mandates
that
the
board
set
the
terms
of
the
scheme
beyond
that
7...
beyond
the
period
of
that
first
7-year
consideration.
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
--isn't...
isn't
your...
your...
isn't
your
argument
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
comes
into
it
because
there
is
a
change
in
the
rule
and
the
rule,
in
effect,
is
what
the
ex
post
facto
clause
means
by
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that...
that's
what
i
was
sort
of
getting
at
by
my
earlier
question.
and
i...
i
understood
your...
your
answer
to
be
that...
or
at
least
i
took
the
significance
of
your
answer
to
be
that
because
the
legislature
mandates
the
board
to
set
these
rules,
i
presume
these
rules
have,
in
effect,
the
significance
of
law
for
purposes
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
understand
it
because
i've
never
heard
of
a
constitutional
principle
that
says
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
have
a
constitutional
rule
because
maybe
you'd
change
it.
i
mean,
that...
that...
so...
so
i
take
it
that
the
issue
in
front
of
us
is
the
old
policy
was
the
policy,
every
3
years
no
matter
what.
the
new
law
or
rule
or
policy
or
reg
is
that
you
don't
get
considered
for
8
years
automatically
but
we
postpone
it
only
if
we
decide
that
earlier
consideration
would
do
you
no
good,
and
if
there's
either
a
change
in
circumstance
or
any
new
information,
tell
us
and
we
will
decide
whether
to
give
you
the
hearing
sooner.
okay?
now,
that
is
what,
i
take
it,
we're
trying
to
decide.
now,
you...
now,
the
question
is
why
is
that
harsher?
