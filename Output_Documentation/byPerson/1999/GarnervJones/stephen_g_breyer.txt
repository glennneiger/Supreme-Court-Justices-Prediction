justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
has
that
to
do
with
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
being
so,
i
mean,
i...
i
didn't
understand
the
eleventh
circuit
at
all,
that
part
of
their
opinion
dealing
with
the
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
number
one,
you
say
maybe
the
person
won't
know
about
it.
well,
i
haven't
found
anything
in
the
record
here
that
suggests
anybody
doesn't
know
about
it.
number
two,
because
there's
a
burden
of
inertia.
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
you're
right.
now,
is
there
a
number
three,
a
number
four,
a
number
five,
and
are
there
any
statistics?
because
despite
the
theory
of
it,
i
would
be
impressed
if
previously
half
the
people
got
out
and
now
only
5
percent
get
out.
so,
what's
the
situation?
what's
argument
three,
four,
and
five?
i
mean,
frankly,
number
two
by
itself
doesn't
seem
that
strong
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
know,
they're...
they're
going
to
make
a
conscious
determination
to...
so,
i
want
to
get
your
other
points.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there's
no
statistical
evidence,
i
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
for
your
client
for
the
reason
that
common
sense
suggests
it
doesn't
make
that
much
difference
whether
you
get
a
hearing
every
3
or
8
years
as
long
as
there's
a
clear
determination
that
a
hearing
wouldn't
do
you
any
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there's
going
to
be
risk...
what's
actually
bothering
me
that
i
haven't
worked
out
is
that
if
i
agreed
with
you
on
this
and
if
the
only
reason
would
be
because
instead
of
you
getting
it
automatically,
they
say...
they
say,
look,
we're
only
not
going
to
give
it
to
people
we'll
never
let
out,
and
we
have
this
system
where
we
get
new
information.
if
i
were
to
agree
with
you
on
that,
then
would
we
start
having
to
go
into
all
kinds
of
procedural
rule
changes?
i
mean,
suppose
for
example,
they
say
summary
judgment
now
is
going
to
be
possible,
and
somebody
would
argue,
oh,
you
know,
if
you
didn't
have
a
summary
judgment
rule,
then
we
would
have
presented
the
evidence
more
thoroughly
at
the
parole
hearing.
or
if
they
say
certain
witnesses
couldn't
come
in.
i
mean,
once
we
get
into
these
procedural
businesses,
are
we
going
to
have
to
start
looking
at
every
one
and
working
out
just
how...
is
there
some
conceivable
disadvantage
or...
do
you
see
my
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
you
to
address
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
say,
which
is
also
true,
time
is
limited,
resources
are
limited,
there
are
a
lot
of
prisoners,
and
we
want
to
allocate
our
time
better.
we
want
to
spend
more
time
with
the
people
who
really
have
a
chance
of
getting
out
and
less
time
with
those
who
have
no
chance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
the
argument
is
that
it's
not
sacrificing
them.
the
argument
is
that
everybody
knows
what
it
is
if
we
have
to
consider
it
every
3
years.
we'll
consider
it.
i
considered
it.
denied.
okay?
next
one.
and
we
can
do
better
for
each
individual,
rather
than
going
through
that
pro
forma
basis,
to
really
take
the
ones
that
do
have
some
chance,
not
zero
chance,
and
looking
at
them
carefully.
we
all
know
what
it
is
to
say
no,
no,
no,
no,
no
in
2
seconds.
but
also
when
you
really
consider
something,
a
guy
who
has
a
chance
to
get
out
sometimes
will
get
out
where
he
wouldn't
have
with
pro
forma
consideration.
so,
they're
saying
we're
doing
it
for
everybody.
