mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
parole
in
georgia
is
a
matter
of
grace.
under
georgia's
parole
system,
no
life
sentenced
inmate
ever
has
any
legal
expectation
of
being
paroled
at
any
point
during
their...
during
their
sentence.
unlike
in
california,
the
discretion
of
georgia's
parole
board
is
based
upon
the
ad
hoc
exercise
of
executive
clemency
power,
and
the
board
does
not
rely
upon
any
statutory
or
regulatory
standards
to
exercise
that
discretion.
thus,
the
board
can
grant
parole
to
any
inmate
within
its
jurisdiction
for
any
reason
at
any
time,
including
the
interim
between
mandatory
reconsideration
dates.
both
the
federal
courts
and
georgia's
courts
have
agreed
that
because
of
its
discretion,
georgia's
parole
system
creates
no
legitimate
expectation
of
parole.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
however,
this
court
in
morales
reviewed
the...
what...
what
has
been
later
called
the
procedural
safeguards
inherent
in
california's
system
to
determine
if
that
system,
which
does
create
an
expectation
of
parole,
changing
the
parole
reconsideration
dates
had
the
effect
of
increasing
the
measure
of
punishment.
however--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
this...
this
court's
test
in
morales.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
i...
i
take
issue
with
that
statistic.
that
statistic
is
misleading.
it
comes
from
statistics
in
1992,
and
it
deals
only
with
inmates
who
were
actually
released
on
parole.
in
1992,
less
than
50
inmates
out
of
a
population
of
4,000
life
sentenced
inmates
were
actually
released
on
parole.
and
of
those--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
presumes
that
the
board
does
not...
well,
first
of
all,
it
presumes
that
the
board
does
not
know
and
does
not
have
the
power
to
decide
ultimately
whether
any
inmate
is
ever
released
on
parole.
it's
the
board
that
makes
that
determination.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
well,
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--but,
your
honor,
that
again
presumes
that
the
board
does
not
have
the
ability
nor
the
knowledge
to
determine
which
inmates
it's
going
to
release
because
these
statistics
are
merely
an
accumulation
of
individualized
determinations
by
the
board.
the
board
ultimately
has
the...
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
any
inmate
is
released
and,
more
importantly--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
is--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--but,
your
honor,
that
assumes
that
those
inmates
would
have
gotten
out
during
that
interim,
but
it's
the
board
that
makes
the
determination
when
they
deny
parole
and
set
it
off.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
but
that
average
is
fallacious,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
but,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
believe
that
the
average
only
applies
to
inmates
that
are
actually
released.
it
takes...
it
does
not
take
account
of
the
other
inmates,
the
other
99
percent
of
those--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
your
honor,
and
also
that
ignores
the
fact
that...
that
in
fact
the
board
does
have
the
ability
to...
to
extraordinarily
reconsider
inmates
and
the
lodged
documents,
the
first
set
of
lodged
documents,
demonstrates
that,
in
fact,
the
board
is
exercising
their
discretion
to
review
inmates
extraordinarily.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
well,
your
honor,
again
i
think
that
assumes
that
the
inmates
would
have
gotten
out
and
that
the
parole
board
doesn't
know--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
again
that
average
is
only
of
the
inmates
that
were
released
and
not
of
the
inmates
that
were
denied
parole.
that...
in
order
to
get
a
true
picture
of
how
long
inmates
serve
in
prison,
you
have
to
consider
three
numbers.
you
have
to
consider,
first
of
all,
how
many
inmates
of
the...
of
the...
the
inmates
that
are
quoted
in
the
misleading
12-year
figure,
how
many
of
those
inmates
were
released
at
their
initial
consideration
date,
which
is
not
indicated,
which
would
have
been
7
years.
so,
for
every
inmate
that's
released
at
7
years,
we
have
an
inmate
that's
serving
19
years
in
incarceration.
that...
that
demonstrates
the
fallacy
of
that
12-year
number.
in
addition
to
that
number,
you
also
have
to
have
how
many
inmates
died
in
prison
and
ultimately
served
their
life
sentence.
and
then
finally,
you
have
to
know
how
many
of
those
inmates
are
still
in
prison.
that...
that
number
is...
is
fallacious
because
it
leads
one
to
believe--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
numbers
ultimately
do
not
matter,
and
the
reason
is
because
again
this
is
an
accumulation
of
individualized
determinations
by
the
board.
each
inmate
is
reviewed
individually.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
in...
in
morales
this
court
looked
at
the
system
that
was
in
place
in...
in
california
and
determined
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
likelihood
that
it
would
have
the
impact
of
increasing
the
sentences.
in
georgia
what
the
respondents
want
is
an
overlay
of
the
morales
factors
that
were
determined
to
be
important
for
california
onto
georgia's
system.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
this
court
in
connecticut
board
of
pardons
v.
dumschat
said
that
no
matter
how
frequently
a
form
of
executive
clemency
is
exercised,
that
does
not
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
protection.
and
in
that
case,
75
percent
of
inmates--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
my
position
is
that
there...
there
are
no
numbers
that
can
give
rise
to...
under
this
system
because
the
board
retains
the
ultimate
discretion
to
determine
whether
the
inmate
gets
out,
that
any
accumulation
of
numbers
is
fallacious
because--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
your
honor,
i
take
issue
with
that,
first
of
all.
and
that
was...
that
was
a
point
that
the
eleventh
circuit
got
wrong,
and
that
is
they
said
that
it...
it
includes
people
that
must
necessarily
expect
to
be
paroled.
well,
of
course,
inmates
in
california
have
a
legal
expectation
of
parole.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
it...
it...
yes,
the...
the--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--correct.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
it
includes
life
sentenced
inmates
who
have
been
denied
parole.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
no,
your
honor,
because
the...
the
idea
of
the
8-year
rule
that's
been...
that's
been
advanced
by
respondents
is
again
fallacious
because
the
rule
is
only
what
it
is
to
each
individual
inmate.
as
the
numbers
that
justice
souter
referred
to
demonstrate,
the
rule
is
not
an
8-year
rule
because
then
100
percent
of
the
inmates
would
be
set
off
for
8
years.
in
fact,
it's...
it's
a
rule
that
applies
an
8-year
cap
to
the
reconsideration
interval
and
allows
the
board,
the
same
board
that
makes
the
determination
if
that
inmate
ever
gets
out,
to
determine
how
frequently
they
should
consider
it.
under
that
theory,
what
we're...
ultimately
what
we're
doing
is
the
board
has
made
a...
this...
made
a
determination
that
this
person
is
not
getting
out
of
prison,
but
yet,
the...
to
read
it
this
way,
it's
going
to
force
the
board
to
reconsider
that
inmate
unnecessarily
for
three
times
when
the
board
has
already
made
the
determination
that
they're
not
going
to
get
out.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
no,
your
honor,
because
that
would
foreclose
the
exercise
of
the
board's
discretion,
and
ultimately
that's--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the...
that
the
board--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
board
could
extend
the
reconsideration
time
table
as
long
as
it
wants
to
because--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
your
honor,
i
said
the
board
because
this
is
the
board's
rule.
this
is
a...
a
rule
that's
promulgated
by
the
board.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
i
believe
that's...
i
believe
that's
perfectly
appropriate.
and
the
reason
is
because
ultimately,
it's
the
discretion
of
the
board
that...
that
this
relies
upon,
unlike
in
california
where
these
rules
were
statutes
imposed
upon
the
board
by
the...
by
the
legislature
in
california.
here,
obviously
the
difference
between
the
two
systems
is
that--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
so
because,
again,
that
would
foreclose
the
board's
opportunity
to
exercise
its
discretion.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
i...
i'm
not
saying
that
the...
that
the
rule
doesn't
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
of
course,
it
does.
however,
i
think
that
under
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
that
is
foreclosing
the
discretion
of
the
board,
unlike
here
where
the
board's
discretion
is
not
foreclosed.
and
in...
and
in
morales,
this
court--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes,
your
honor.
the
board
freed
itself
to
review
inmates
that
in
its
determination...
since
it
makes
the
decision
as
to
whether
these
inmates
are
ever
released,
it
freed
the
board
to
review
those
inmates
that
do
have
a
near
term
likelihood
for
success
unlike
inmates
like
respondent
jones
who
doesn't.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that's
correct,
but
i...
i
understood...
i
understood
your
honor
to
amend
the
hypothetical
to
say
that
they
wouldn't
review,
and
that
would
foreclose
discretion.
in
this
particular
circumstance,
under
the
rule
as
it
exists,
their
discretion
is
not
foreclosed.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
but
if
it
foreclosed
discretion,
it...
it
could
only
apply
that
prospectively.
it
could
not
apply
that
retrospectively
because
that
would
change
the
availability
of
the
discretion
and
that
would
impact
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
as
opposed
to
here
where
ultimately
any
inmate
that's
sentenced
to
life
sentence,
the
only
thing
that
will
ever
get
that
inmate
out
of
prison
is
a
decision
by
the
parole
board
that
he
should
be
paroled.
and
in
morales,
this
court
said
that
it
was
the
fact
that...
that
extraordinary
reconsideration
was
not
foreclosed
by
the
statute
that
saved
it
and
not
the
fact
that
it
was
specifically
provided
for,
as
it
is
here.
it
is
explicit
in
the...
in
the
procedure
that
the
board
can
do
that,
and
in
fact
the
lodged
documents
demonstrate
that
they
are
doing
that
in
fact.
furthermore,
that
procedure
is
merely
a
reflection--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
that
policy
statement
was,
in
fact,
issued
at
the
time
that
the
board
began
to
apply
those
retroactively.
that's
been--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes,
i
am.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
it
was.
and,
your
honor,
that
was
addressed
in
the--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--your
honor,
the...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
policy
was
in
place.
the
one
that
was
presented
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--had
a
date
on
it
of
1996.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
i'm
sorry.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
correct.
the
1996
policy
did
not
change
anything.
the
same
substantive
policy
was
in
effect
when
mr.
jones
was
set
off
in
1995.
and
that
was
explained
in
our
briefs
before
the
eleventh
circuit.
what...
what
occurred
was
that
the
board,
when
they
produced
a
copy,
a...
a
verified
copy,
produced
the
most
recent
one
which
had
a
1996
date
on
it.
in
fact,
i
represent
to
the
court
that...
that
that,
as
we
represented
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
was
in
effect
at
the
time.
however,
that
policy
is
merely
a
reflection
of
the
board's
previously
existing
discretion
to
review
any
inmate
at
any
time.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
know
why
they...
why
they...
perhaps
it
changed
some
irrelevant
verbiage
in...
in
the
policy,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
policy
regarding
the
ability
and
the
availability
of
reconsideration,
extraordinary
reconsideration,
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
no.
what
it
means
is
that
the
board,
which
ultimately
has
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
they
get
out,
can
determine
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
they
present--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
it
can
be...
it
can
be
triggered
by
an
application
of
the
inmate,
but
perhaps...
perhaps
i
haven't
made
myself
clear.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
the...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
board
makes
the
determination
whether
the
inmate
has
demonstrated
the...
the
kind
of...
of
change
in
circumstances
particular
to
that
inmate.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
certainly,
it
could
do
that
as
well
based
on--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes,
it
does,
because
the...
because
the
board
has
parole
officers
at
many
of
the
prisons
throughout
the
state,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
parole
board
constantly
receives
information
from
the
department
of
corrections.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
your
honor,
based
upon
information
that
they
might
receive
from
someone
other
than...
than
the
inmate.
perhaps
the
department
of
corrections
might
communicate
to
the
board
that
an
inmate...
his
circumstances
have
changed.
now,
that
can
be
a
lot
of
different
things,
and
whether
it's
important
enough--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
ignores
the
fact
that...
that
the
inmate
is
always
free
to
bring
to
the...
bring
to
the
board's
attention
any
change
in
circumstances
which
he
or
she
feels
are
sufficient
to
warrant
reconsideration.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
most
assuredly,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
that
happens
constantly.
inmates
are
bringing
information
to
the
board's
attention.
however--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
first
set
of
lodged
documents
demonstrates
that
10
inmates
were
extraordinarily
reconsidered...
excuse
me...
during
fiscal
year
1999
and
5
of
those
inmates
were
actually
released
based
upon
that
extraordinary
reconsideration.
that's
exactly...
that's
exactly
the
scenario--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
rendered
in
january
of
'99
and--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
because
the
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment.
summary
judgment
motions
were
filed
by
both
the
plaintiff,
mr.
jones,
and
by
the
board.
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
is
the
basis
upon
which
this
was
decided.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not
because
as
the
court...
as
the
district
court
below
found
and
as
the
eleventh
circuit
below
found
that
the
case
could
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
put
this...
we
put
this
before
the
court
because
of
the
information
that
respondents
put
in
their
brief
trying
to
indicate
that
this
was
a
mere
pipe
dream,
that
in
fact
it
never
happened.
in
fact,
it
does
happen,
and
these
numbers
are
not
intended,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
to
demonstrate
how
it
always
happens
because
these
are
merely
anecdotal...
anecdotal
examples
that
were
recalled
by
the
staff
because
they
don't
keep
the
numbers
to
determine
on
an
annual
basis
how
many
extraordinary
reconsideration
inmates
are
released
because,
again,
we
go
back
to
the
central
point,
and
that
is
these
are
individual
determinations.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there...
there
is
information
that's
before
this
court
that
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court.
but
ultimately
none
of
that
information
matters
because
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
fact
that
the
law
requires
the
board
to
engage
in
individualized
determinations
as
to
each
inmate.
and
any
accumulation
or
agglomeration
of
statistics
is
merely
that.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
that
issue
hasn't
specifically
been
addressed,
but
i
would
assume
that--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--yes,
i
am.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
i
do
not
disagree
with
the
facts
included
in
the
12-year
average,
for
instance.
what
i
disagree
with
is
the
manner
in
which
it's...
it
has
been
represented
to
this
court,
that
that
actually
represents
anything
more
than
a
snapshot
from
one
group
of...
group
of
inmates
that
were
actually
released
when
they
represented
only
1
percent
of
the
life
sentenced
inmate
population.
so,
yes,
i...
to
answer
the
court's
question,
i
don't
disagree
with
the
facts,
but
that's
like
saying,
well,
i
may...
may
or
may
not
disagree
with
a
particular
fact,
but
i
do
disagree
with
the
way
it
has
been
portrayed.
and
i
think
that's
where
the...
that's
where
the
fallacy
is.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
correct.
and
the
inference
that
should
be
drawn
from
the
fact
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
because
it
doesn't
tell
us
anything.
as
i...
as
i
was...
as
i
was
answering
previously,
for
every
inmate
that
was
released
at
the
7-year
initial
consideration
date,
another
inmate
had
to
have
served
12
years
to
make
an
average
of...
excuse
me...
had
to
have
served
19
years
to
make
an
average
of
12
years.
and
the...
again,
those
numbers
don't
tell
us
anything.
it...
it
would
be
possible
for
50
inmates
to
be
paroled
in
a
single
year
with
an
average
of
12
years
served
and
not
a
one
of
them
would
have
served
12
years.
so,
what
does
that
tell
us?
that
tells
us
that
the
board
ultimately
is
making
individualized
determinations
based
upon
the
individual
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
inmates
to
determine
whether
they
should
be
paroled.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
before
the
expiration
of...
of
what--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--their
lives?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
the...
the
numbers...
the
number
that
has
been
put
in
respondent's
brief,
the
12-year
average
number--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--less
than
50
inmates
were
paroled
in
1992
where
these
numbers
came
from.
in
1992,
there
were
approximately
4,000
life
sentenced
inmates
in
georgia.
so,
therefore,
it
was
approximately
1
percent
of
the
life
sentenced
inmates
that
were
released
on
parole
that
year.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
during
that
year.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
that
particular
year.
i
apologize
if
i...
if
i
misrepresented
that.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
in
addition--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that...
that
the...
the
key
issue
here
is
that
it's
the
board's
discretion
exercised
on
an
individual
basis
that
leads
to
the
determinations
made
by
the
board.
and
in
fact--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--but
doesn't
that
reduce--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--but,
your
honor,
doesn't
that
reduce
parole
reconsideration
to
a
war
of
attrition
and
assume
that
the
board
is...
board's
will
is
going
to
be
overborne
merely
by
having
to
reconsider
someone
more
frequently
when
they
themselves
had
made
the
determination
that
that
inmate
is
not
going
to
get
out
and
doesn't
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
parole
at
any
time
during
the
set
off
period,
whether
that
set
off
period
is
2
years,
7
years,
or
as
in
mr.
jones'
case,
8
years?
that
presupposes
that
the
board
doesn't
know
what
it's
doing
with...
with
the
cases.
and
in
fact,
it
does
because
the
board
is
making
that
individualized
determination.
it's
looking
at
mr.
jones
alone
and
saying--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--well,
your
honor,
again
that
trivializes
the
fact
that
the
board
makes
individualized
determinations.
the
board--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--i
do
not,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--but,
your
honor,
because
of
the
individualized
determination,
there
is
no
way
to
know
that
it
was
the
change
that
had
anything
to
do
with
that.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that...
i
don't
recall
the
particular
statistics
that
this
court
paid
attention
to
except
that
the...
the
key
in
morales
was
that
the
burden
was
placed
on
the
inmate
to
demonstrate
that
there
had
been
an
increase
in
the
measure
of
punishment.
and
that's
why
this
court
was
careful
to
say
that
it
was
the
availability,
for
instance,
of...
it
was
the
fact
that
extraordinary
reconsideration
was
not
foreclosed
which
allowed
that...
allowed
that
statute
to
be
okay.
again,
if
we
compare
california's
statute
with
georgia's
statute,
we're
comparing
a
system
that
creates
an
expectation
of
parole
with
one
that
does
not.
and
there...
that
is
important
not
because
it's
a
due
process
case
but
because
in
california's
system
something
was
being
taken
away.
something
that
was
protected
by
the
constitution
was
being
taken
away,
and
that
is
the
expectation
of
parole
by
possibly
delaying
a
reconsideration.
however,
in
georgia's
that
is
not
being
taken
away.
so,
therefore,
the
existence
of
the
same
safeguards
in
georgia,
of
course,
militates
toward
finding
that
georgia's
statute
is...
passes
muster
on
the...
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
just
like
california's
did.
your
honor,
ultimately
the
only
change
that
has
taken
place
in
this
case
is
how
frequently
the...
the
board
must
reconsider
mr.
jones
after
denying
him
parole
and
determining
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
conclude
that
he
will
be
paroled
in
the
interim
of
the
set
off.
any
conclusion
that
this
change
increases
the
quantum
of
punishment
is
merely
speculative.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
i'd
ask
that
i...
that
i
could
keep
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
your
honor,
very
briefly.
the
protections
in
morales
existed
only
because
that
system
created
an
expectation
of
parole.
it
created
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
i
was
not,
your
honor.
however,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
contrary
to
counsel's
argument,
the
board
is
not
required
to
set
periodic
reconsiderations
by
the
statute.
the
statute
merely
calls
on
the
board,
if
it
adopts
rules,
to
have
rules
regarding
consideration
and
reconsideration.
the
board
could,
therefore--
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
--pardon?
mr.
christopher
s.
brasher
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
but
i
believe
that
the...
that
the
citation
is
official
code
of
georgia
annotated,
42-9-42
i
believe.
but
it's
very
close
to
that
statute
that
is
the
rule
that...
the
law
that
gives
the
board
the
ability
to
adopt
these
and
promulgate
these
rules.
it
doesn't
require
periodic
reconsideration
as
has
been
argued
by
respondents.
finally,
as
to
mr.
newberry's
case,
mr.
newberry's
case
was
well
publicized
in
the
news
media.
