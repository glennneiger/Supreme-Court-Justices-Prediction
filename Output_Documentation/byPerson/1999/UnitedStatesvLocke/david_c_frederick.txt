mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
international
ramifications
of
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
because
under
title
ii
of
the
pwsa,
the
secretary
is
obliged
to
give
reciprocal
rights
to
foreign
flag
vessels
that...
that
comply
with
international
agreements
to
which
the
united
states
has
acceded.
and
that
international
reciprocity
is
tied
into
the
title
ii
fields
that
mr.
benner
earlier
described
that
are
particularly
applicable
in
this
case,
that
those
fields,
personnel
qualifications,
manning,
operations,
and
equipment.
and
the
same
reasons
that
this
court
held
in
ray
it
applied
for
design
and
construction
are
equally
applicable
for
those
fields
as
well.
the
secretary
issues
a
license
as--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
o'connor,
we're
in
both.
and
let
me
try
to
distinguish
for
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
some
of
the...
some
of
the
issues
here
involve
the
fields,
and
they
relate
to
the
vessel
as
a
system,
what
the
qualifications
are
of
the
personnel
aboard,
what
manning
requirements
are...
are
imposed,
what
kinds
of
equipment
has
to
be
tested
at
particular
times
and
operational.
those
are
clearly
in
the
fields.
there
are
international
agreements
that
set
standards
the
secretary
is
obliged
to
give
reciprocal
rights
to.
now,
there
are
other
rules,
and
i
would
identify
three
for
the
court
that
arguably...
arguably...
could
be
within
the
local
peculiarities
of
the
waterways,
and
those
concern
the
advance
notice
of
entry,
the
position
plotting,
and
restricted
visibility
watchkeeping
requirements.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
washington
here
has
not
attempted
to
justify
in
its
rationale
for
these
rules
that
they
are
related
at
all
to
the
peculiarities
of
washington
waters.
they
apply
to
the
many
thousands
of
miles
of
washington
waters
that
are
in
puget
sound
and
out...
the
underlying...
outlying
coast.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
watchkeeping.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's...
that...
it's
not
subject
to
field
preemption
within
the
statutory
fields
of
title
ii.
our
position
is,
consistent
with
ray,
that
title
i
gives
the
coast
guard
regulatory
field
preemption
so
that
if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
and
the
court
made
very
clear
with
the
tug
escort
requirement
in
that
case
that
if
the
coast
guard
had
issued
a
tug
escort
requirement,
that
that
would
occupy
the
field
as
to
tug
escorts
and
would
not
preempt
a...
and
would
not
be
preemptive
of
a
state
rule
if
there
was
no
coast
guard
regulation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
why
i
stressed
arguably,
justice
scalia.
in
our
view,
most
of
these
rules
apply
to
the
vessel
as
a
system.
they're
not
local
traffic
type
rules.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
and...
and,
you
know,
some
of
them
in
our
view
would
be
deemed
manning
requirements,
but
that
in
any
event
because...
if
they
are
justified
as
local
traffic
rules,
they
are
preempted
because
of
contrary
coast
guard
determinations
to
issue
a
rule
as
to
those
kinds
of
conditions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
be
happy
to
address
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning.
in
our
view,
section
1018
of
the
oil
pollution
act
has
no
applicability
to
this
case
whatsoever.
the
plain
language
of
that
statute,
which
respondents
do
not
contest
our
argument...
it
begins
with
the
phrase,
nothing
in
this
act...
i.e.,
nothing
in
opa...
shall
affect
the
right
of
the
states
to
impose
additional
requirements.
nothing
in
section
1018
affects
the
ability...
the
preemptive
force
of
federal
law
under
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act,
the
ptsa--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
souter,
that
would
be
an
eminently
reasonable
holding
of
this
court.
we
have
offered
illustrations
in
our
submissions
so
that
the
concreteness
of
the
dispute
is
apparent
to
the
court,
and
in
our
view
some
of
these
rules
are
sufficiently
clearly
preempted
that
the
court
could
hold
them
so.
we've
offered
those
illustrations
for
the
benefit
of
the
court.
we
have
not
attempted
to
be
exhaustive
because
of
the
page
limits.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reaffirm
the
title
ii/title
i
preemptive
dichotomy
that
the
court
explained
in
ray
and
to
show
that
those
issues
and
subjects
in
46
u.s.c.
3703(a)
are
entitled
to
the
same
field
preemptive
consequences
because
they
basically
allow
for
the
same
reasons.
if
i
could
just
point
out
that
vessels
move
from
place
to
place
and
nation
to
nation,
and
there's
no
difference
in
the
design
and
construction
of
a
vessel
as
there
are
in
the
kinds
of
personnel
qualifications
that
would
be
at
issue
for
a
vessel
that
would
move
in
such
places.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
justice
scalia,
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
oil
pollution
act
addresses
pollution
not
only
from
vessels
but
from
land-based
sources.
so,
when
congress
was
attempting
to
save
from
preemptive
effect
preexisting
authority,
there
is
clearly
state
police
power
with
respect
to
land-based
oil
pollution.
there's
no
indication
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of...
of
the
oil
pollution
act,
and
in
particular
section
1018
where
the
conference
committee
that
added
that
section
said
expressly
that
it
had
no
intent
to
undo
ray
v.
atlantic
richfield,
which
clearly
upheld
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act.
moreover,
there
are
things
that
are
clearly
saved
by
1018,
the
response
that
a
state
can
make
to
oil
pollution,
additional
liability
requirements
that
a
state
might
impose,
penalties
for
polluters,
requirements
and
certificates
of
financial
responsibility.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
brings
the
state
on
board
the
vessel
to
regulate
the
subjects
that
have
been
historically
within
the
realm
of
federal
regulation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
errors.
the
principal
one
is,
as
you
say,
that...
that
somehow
in
a
later
act
congress
intended,
silently
without
saying
so
in
a
seven-word
phrase,
to
eviscerate
literally
thousands
of
pages
of
federal
statutory
and
regulatory
and
international
treaty
law.
there's
no
indication
that...
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
do
that.
it
also
read
a
savings
clause
so
broadly
as
to
eviscerate
specific
directives
contained
in
federal
law
in
these
other
vessel
regulation
statutes.
and
we
point
out
the
cases
from
this
court
indicating
that
a
savings
clause
should
never
be
read
so
broadly
as
to
eviscerate
the
specific
directives
given
in...
in
the
federal
law.
and
finally,
it
just
missed
it
on
the
plain
text
of
the
provision
which
says,
this
act
means
this
act.
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--congress
specifically
took
local
concerns
into
consideration
in
enacting
the
pwsa
title
i
where
it
directed
the
coast
guard
to
take
into
account
the
views
of
state
and
local
officials
in
promulgating
local
traffic
rules.
and
then
after
ray,
it
amended
title
ii
to
require
the
coast
guard
to
take
into
account
the
views
of
states
in
issuing
the
systems-based
regulations.
so,
there
is
a
role
for
the
states
to
play.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
congress
made
very
clear
it
wanted
there
to
be
one
decision
maker,
and
there
are
important
international
ramifications
to
that.
because
of
the
international
treaties
to
which
we've--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
international
ramifications
are
as
follows,
mr.
chief
justice.
under
applicable
treaties,
manning
requirements
and
certain
conditions
are
specified,
and
the
discretion
is
left
to
the
master
to
determine
how
best
to
get
to
port.
congress
made
the
decision
that
because
the...
of
the
coast
guard's
expertise
and
its
role
in
the
international
maritime
field,
the
coast
guard
could
make
the
decision
as
to
those
particular
conditions.
we
would
concede,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
is
no
rule
where
the
coast
guard
has
specifically
looked
at
this,
the
state
has
room
to
regulate,
and
in
that
regard,
we
may
differ
somewhat
from
intertanko's
position.
but
that's
far...
a
far
cry
from
the
encroachment
of
these
state
rules
onto
the
vessel
that
apply
extraterritorial,
like
the
drug
testing
provision
which
requires
drug
tests,
random
drug
tests,
on
vessels
that
may
never
come
to
washington
for
many
years
but
require
tests
to
be
submitted
and
sent
to
the
state
of
washington--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
varies
widely,
justice
stevens.
we've
got
five
volumes
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
here,
two
of
which--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
or
even
to
a
part
of
puget
sound.
and
we've
acknowledged
in
our
reply
brief
that
a
tug
escort
requirement
imposed
by
these
bap
rules
for
a
tug
escort
in
and
out
of
port
angeles
is
the
kind
of
local
operating
rule
where
the
coast
guard
has
not
issued
a
regulation,
and
in
our
view
that
is
not
preempted
by
a
coast
guard
regulation
promulgated
under
title
i.--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
we
didn't
brief
the
question
because
we
don't
regard
it
as
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide.
the
textual
indicator
of
this
act
is
sufficiently
clear
to
dispose
of
the
question.
i've
indicated
those
areas
that
we
think
are
clearly
saved.
in
title
iv,
congress
gave
certain
directives
to
the
coast
guard
to
promulgate
certain
kinds
of
rules.
our
view
is
that
the
savings
clause
doesn't
affect
the
preemptive
effect
of
title
iv
because
the
coast
guard
had
preexisting
preemptive
authority
under
prior
statutes,
and
title
iv
is
simply
telling
the
coast
guard
we
want
you
to
exercise
that
preexisting
authority.
there
is
an
area
in
the
middle
between
those
aspects
of
direct
vessel
regulation
and
those
aspects
of
financial
liability
requirements
that
i
outlined
before
the
response
to
liability
where
it
is
a
difficult
question.
and
because
of
the...
the
concern
with
not
creating
unintended
consequences
for
creating
our
position,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
in
the
abstract
about
what
the
phrase,
additional
requirements
with
respect
to
an
oil
discharge
or
substantial
threat
of
oil
discharge,
are.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
add
that
since
ray
a
number
of
important
developments
have
occurred
that
reaffirm
the
preemptive
force
of
ray.
in
the
court's
decision
in
that
case
on
pages
166
to
68,
the
court
emphasized
that
congress
had
made
international
uniformity
a
key
issue.
and
since
ray
was
decided,
congress
has
enacted
the
ptsa.
it
has
promulgated
into
positive
law
title
46
which
contains
field
preemptive
elements
that
we
have
been
talking
about,
and
in
the
international
realm,
the
solas
convention,
the
safety
of
life
at
sea
convention,
has
been
ratified
by
the
united
states.
the
standards
for
training
certification
of
watchkeeping
have
been
implemented
and
enforced
by
the
united
states.
the
marpol
convention,
which
directly
relates
to
pollution
by
vessels
from
oil
tankers,
has
been
ratified
in
the
united
states.
and
the
international
safety
management
code
has
also
been...
has
also
been
implemented
into
united
states
domestic
law.
this
international
regime
is
a
constantly
evolving
process
in
which
the
united
states
is
the
leader,
and
every
year
a
refinement
to
that
process
has
been
made.
it
would
greatly
upset
uniformity
if
each
state,
each...
each
of
the
23
coastal
states,
were
able
to
pick
and
choose
which
federal
requirements
they
wanted
to
adopt,
which
ones
they
wanted
to
go
beyond.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't...
i
don't
know
of
a
case
on
that
subject,
justice
kennedy,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
relevant
for
this
purpose
because
congress,
in
each
instance
of
those
acts...
and
we've
provided
the
citations
in
our
brief...
has
not
only
ratified,
but
it
has
directed
the
coast
guard
to
engage
in
that
enforcement.
so,
the
court
would
not
need
to
rely
on
just
the
ratification
of
an
international
treaty
for
field
preemption.
and
each
of
those
subjects
of
those
international
treaties
is
a
subject
in
title
ii
of
the
pwsa
which--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
we...
express
preemption
would
be
where
there
was,
you
know,
an
express
statement
that
the
law
was
intended
to
be
preempted.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
two
ways.
they
cover
the
subjects
in
title
ii
that
are
field
preemptive
and
the
secretary
is
obliged
under
the
statute
to
honor
reciprocal
rights.
they
also
are
given
licenses,
and
the...
the
uninterrupted
flow
of
this
court's
cases
since
gibbons
v.
ogden
is
that
a
state
may
not
supplement
or
augment
a
duly
authorized
federal
license.
47
u.s.c.
370...
46
u.s.c.
3703
says
these
treaties
require
certificates.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
adds
in
the
sense
that
there
are
specific
provisions
here
that
make
very
clear
the
occupation
of
the
field
and
congress'
intent
to
do
so.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'd
like
to
make
a...
a
couple
of
points.
first,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
three
footnotes
in
our
reply
brief
which
i
think
will
help
the
court
in
its
opinion
in
this
case.
those
are
footnotes
4,
12,
and
14.
footnote
4
sets
out
those
bap
rules
that
are
directly
in
fields
that
we
think
are
preempted
under
the
field
preemptive
theory
of
title
ii.
footnote
12
sets
out
the
bap
rules
where
there
is
a
subject
covered
by
a
license
and
that
includes
things
like
language
proficiency
which
is
clearly
a
personnel
qualification
and
the
like.
and
note
14
is
the
only
one
where
there
arguably
might
be
a
reason
to
remand
for
purposes
of
developing
a
record.
i
would
note
that
at
the
district
court
both
sides
made
consensual
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
viewed
this
as
something
that
could
be
decided
on
the
record.
as
to
those
subjects
in
the
field,
that
clearly
could
be
the
case
here
as
well.
the
treaties
that
i
emphasized
in
my
opening
presentation
reinforce
the
preemption
that
congress
specified
in
title
ii,
and
those
treaties
make
very
clear
the
reciprocal
rights
that
must
be
afforded.
what
washington
here
is...
is
purporting
to
be
able
to
do
is
to
imprison
and
impose
civil
fines
against
vessels
and
their
operators
for
people
who
don't
comply
with
state
rules.
that's
directly
contrary
to
a
long
line
of
this
court's
decisions
that
say
that
states
can't
supplement
federal
licenses
or
federally
recognized
licenses.
now,
with
respect
to
language
proficiency,
counsel
is
simply
incorrect,
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
36
of
our
opening
brief
where
we
make
very
clear
that
the
purpose
behind
the
international
stcw
requirement
is
to
ensure
that
the
vessel
as
a
system
can
work
appropriately
so
that
those
officers
on
the
navigation
watch
can
communicate
with
the
people
who
will
be
carrying
out
the
orders.
english
may,
in
fact,
be
the
problem
in
some
circumstances
and
not
the
solution
and
that
is
a
reflection
of
the
way
the
international
maritime
commerce
works.
finally,
i
would
just
point
out
that
the
flag
state
controls,
and
with
respect
to
drug
testing
and
alcohol,
there
is
a
coast
guard
regulation
that
makes
clear...
it's
at
33
c.f.r.
95.020...
that
no
vessel,
foreign
or
otherwise,
may
operate
in
u.s.
waters
by
personnel
who
have
an
alcohol
level
above.04.
now,
that
is
indeed
different
from
a
zero
tolerance
level,
but
that
is
a
