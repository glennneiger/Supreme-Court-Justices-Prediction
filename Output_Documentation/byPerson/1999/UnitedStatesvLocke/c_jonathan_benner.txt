mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
first
day
of
our
existence
as
a
nation,
we've
relied
on
the
merchant
ships
of
the
united
states
and
foreign
nations
to
bear
the
vast
preponderance
of
our
interstate
and
our
foreign
commerce.
there
have
been
some
amicus
submissions
on
this
side
of
the
argument
that
give
you
some
sense
not
only
of
the
historic
scope
of
that
reliance,
but
also
the
present
scope
and
the
complexity
of
the
routes
that
these
vessels
travel.
each
of
these
vessels
is
a
complex
collection
of
systems
and
subsystems,
both
structural
and
mechanical,
but
also
each
depends
on
the
knowledge
and
skill
and
judgment
of
mariners
not
only
from
the
united
states,
but
from
around
the
world.
each
of
these
vessels
is
subject
to
an
intricate
federal
system
of
permits,
inspections,
certifications
by
personnel
of
the
united
states
coast
guard
acting
pursuant
to
authority
vested
in
them
by
the
united
states
congress.
the
founders
were
very
familiar
with
this
industry.
they
knew
it
very
well.
they
knew
its
complexities.
they
knew
its
central
importance
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
the
economic
health
of
its...
of
the
nation.
and
they
knew
its
links
to
international
law.
they
understood
that
each
vessel
carried
with
it
a
physical
projection
of
the
sovereignty
of
another
nation
and
they
knew
that
the
citizens
aboard
that
vessel
often
were
from
other
nations
and
that
along
with
the
possibility
of
prosperity
that
came
with
these
maritime
transactions,
there
also
was
the
possibility
of
conflict
with
other
nations
in
how
we
dealt
with
those
vessels
when
they
called
at
our
ports.
the
united
states
and
intertanko
here
seek
reversal
of
a
decision
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
i
believe
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
countenanced
an
intrusion
by
a
state
government,
in
this
case
the
state
of
washington,
into
areas
that
are
exclusively
regulated
by
the
federal
government.
and
to
define
this
field
at
the
start,
we
are
relying
on
the
enumeration
of
subject
matters
in
46
u.s.c.
3703(a),
the
design,
construction,
alteration,
repair,
maintenance,
equipping,
personnel
qualifications,
and
manning
of
the
vessels.
this
is
the
realm
that
we
believe
has
strong
federal
connotations
that
must
be
protected
in
this
case.
by
inserting
itself
into
these
subject
matters,
our
concern
is
that
the
state
of
washington
necessarily
displaces
federal
judgments
governing
these
vessels
and
compromises
the
constitutionally
essential
supremacy
of
federal
law
in
this
particular
area.
the
practical--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--we
take
the
position
that
all
of
them,
justice
o'connor,
are
preempted
by
federal
law
itself
in
the
subject
matters
described
in
46
u.s.c.,
section
3703.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
yes.
we...
we
do
contend...
and
i'll
be
very
clear
about
that.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
there
is
a
condition
of
field
preemption
that
surrounds
that
component
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
that
is
correct.
now,
like
people
in
our
profession
have
a
tendency
to
do,
we
have
also
pointed
to
express--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--we...
we
have
also
pointed
to...
to
instances
in
which
the
united
states
coast
guard
has
spoken
expressly
preemptively
in
its
regulations
and
that
those
express
preemptive
statements
are
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
coast
guard
has
said
on
several
occasions,
in
issuing
regulations
pursuant
to
title
46
and
also
to
title
33,
that
it
is
the
coast
guard's
intent
to
oust
differential
state
action
in
those
areas.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
indeed,
justice
o'connor,
that
is--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--yes.
i...
i
believe
it
is,
justice
stevens.
the...
ray
we
rely
on
heavily,
but
i...
i
certainly
acknowledge
that
in
ray
the
issues
you
were
looking
at
in
that
decision
were
design
and
construction
elements.
we
are
saying
here--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--the...
the
two
that
were
held
valid
by
the
court
in
ray
that...
that
maybe
illustrate
our
point
are,
one,
a
tug
escort
provision,
which
was
not
held
valid
under
what
we
are
calling
title
ii,
as
a
shorthand
reference,
to
pwsa,
the
3703(a)
subject
matters,
but
was
held
valid
under
title
i
of
pwsa
which
was
a
discretionary
element
of
the
law
and
remains
a
discretionary
element
of
the
law.
we
read
the
court's
decision
in
ray
to
say
the
states
do
have
an
ability
to
act
in
these
discretionary
areas...
and
the
tug
escort
provision
was
deemed
to
be
one...
if
the
federal
government
has
not
acted.
now,
a
salient
point
in
the
fact
pattern
that
we
present
to
you
here
is
that
in
every
single
element
of
the
challenged
state
regulations,
there
is
a
corresponding
federal
regulation.
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--that
is
our
argument
because
we
believe
that
every
one
of
these
regulations
falls
within
the
understood
meaning
of
design,
construction,
alteration,
repair,
maintenance,
particularly
in
this
case
personnel
qualifications
and
manning
and
operations.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
i
think
to
understand
why
it's
important
to
the
federal
system,
your
honor,
that...
that
all
of
these
things
work
together,
you
have
to
understand
the
system...
the
vessel
as
a
system.
the
section
3703(a)
describes
a
number
of
elements
of
the
operation
of
the
vessel,
all
of
which
link
together.
what
we're
concerned
about
is
that
if
the
states
can
selectively
adjust
elements
of
that
system,
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
judge
what
the
impact
of
that
adjustment
is.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
the
language,
justice
o'connor,
that
you
find
in...
in
much
of
the
maritime
preemption
case
law
that
this
court
has
generated
about
local
conditions
seems
to
be
related
to
such
matters
as
fishing,
conservation,
that
kind
of
thing,
or
is...
is
recited
before,
in
the
case
of
ray,
finding
that
the
tug
escort
provision
was
a
title
i
discretionary
pwsa
matter.
we
believe
that
the
significance
of
local
conditions--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--yes.
i...
i
do
acknowledge,
justice
ginsburg,
that
in
title
i
you
have
vessel
operating
requirements
as...
as
part
of
the
statutory
description
of
the
field
there;
whereas,
in
title
ii
you
have
operations.
we...
as
a
first
level
answer
to
your
question,
we
contend
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
our
preemption
analysis.
we're
contending
that
even
title
i
is
heavily
preemptive,
and
if
you
look
at
ray,
it's
very
clear
that
the
court
found
that
the
congressional
decision
to
permit
state
action
with
regard
to
structures
included
an
implicit
decision
to
ban
the
states
from
regulating
with
regard
to
vessel
standards.
the
thing
that
saved
the
tug
escort
requirement
in
ray
and
which
is
not
applicable
here
was
the
absence
of
a
federal
presence
in
that
particular
element.
the
court
said,
it
may
be
that
the
united
states
will
come
to
regulate
that,
and
when
that
happens,
that
will
have
preemptive
effect.
but
it
hadn't
happened
at
the
time
of
the
ray
decision.
so,
our
answer
is--
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
--yes.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
justice
scalia,
we
make
a
distinction
between
title
ii
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
and
title
i
of
that
act.
in
other
words,
the
one
that
is
mandatory
is
title
ii,
and
in
that
case,
we're
claiming
field
preemption.
mr.
c.
jonathan
benner
i...
i
don't
believe
you
can
place
all
of
them
under
title
i.
the...
the
ambiguity
about
the
distinction
between
title
i
and
title
ii
is
the
use
of
the
word
operating
requirements
in
title
i
and
the
word
operations
in
title
ii.
we
contend
that
all
of
these
provisions
fall
within
title
ii
because
they're
either
operations,
personnel
qualifications,
or
manning
requirements
that...
and...
and
we
accept
your...
your
proposition
that,
because
we
are
arguing
field
preemption,
the
states
are
completely
barred
from
entering
that
area.
the
confusion...
my
time
is
expired.
