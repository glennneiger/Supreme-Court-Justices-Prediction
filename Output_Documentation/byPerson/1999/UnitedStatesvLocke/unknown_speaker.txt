unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
benner,
if
you
take
the
position
that
all
13
of
the
provisions
before
us
here
are
preempted
by
federal
law
itself
or
that
some
of
them
are
preempted
by
coast
guard
regulation?
unknown
speaker
some
sort
of
field
preemption.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
first
position
would
be
that
field
preemption
applies
and
we
don't
have
to
look
further.
unknown
speaker
a
fall-back
provision.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
there
you
rely
on
coast
guard
regulations
that
contain
language
expressly
preempting
state
law?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
coast
guard
were
silent
on
some
of
these
points,
you
still
think
there
is
federal--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
your
position
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
decision
in
ray?
your
first
position.
i
know
your
second
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
also
the
court
held
that
some
of
the
regulations
were
valid
in
that--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
your
second...
that's
your
fall-back
argument.
your
first
argument
is
the
statute
itself,
3703,
takes
care
of
everything.
unknown
speaker
why
should
manning
and
operations...
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
the
state
have
something
to
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
concede
is
left
open
to
states
in
this
area?
what
about
conditions
peculiar
to
local
waters?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
we
know
that
the...
the
provisions
of
washington
law
you
are
contesting
necessarily
fall
under
title
ii
and
not
under
title
i?
it
seems
that
some
title
i
subjects
involve
operations.
unknown
speaker
i
must
say
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
to
me
where
you
have
field
preemption,
i...
i
thought
that
by
definition
field
preemption
meant,
if
you're
relying
on
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
what
you're
doing,
it
means,
whether
or
not
the
government
acts,
we've
occupied
the
field.
and
if...
if
we
decide
there
should
be
no
regulation
of
this,
there
shall
be
no
regulation.
period.
that...
and...
but
you're...
you're...
you
have
some
kind
of
a
hybrid
where...
where
you
claim
field
preemption
but
then
explain
the
exception
in
ray
by
saying,
well,
there
was
no...
you
know,
there
had
been
no
specific
rule
promulgated
there.
unknown
speaker
but
justice
ginsburg's
question
drew
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
you
could
place
these
matters
under
title
i.--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
benner.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
we
talk
about
whether
it's
field
preemption
or
conflict
preemption
or
something
else?
and
how
do
you
read
ray?
there
were
exceptions
in
ray.
so,
it's
hard
to
look
at
it
as
a
field
preemption
case.
unknown
speaker
where
are
we?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
may
i
ask...
you
say
visibility
and
piloting.
was
it
piloting
that
you
said
was
involved?
unknown
speaker
watchkeeping.
does
that
mean
in
the
heavy...
when
the
visibility
is
way
down,
as
it
often
is
in
that
area,
is
their
three
officer
on
the
deck
something
that
would
be
arguably
not
subject
to
field
preemption?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
that
would
be
bad
only
if
it's
covered
by
a
coast
guard
regulation.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
how
you...
how
you
get
into
the
definition
of
the
field
the
matter
of
local
conditions.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
a
manning
requirement
is...
is
demanded
by
local
conditions,
it
is
a
manning
requirement
nonetheless.
it
seems
to
me
you're
trying
to
slip
in
under
the...
under
the
field
definition,
a
totally
extraneous
matter,
and
that
is
whether
local
conditions,
in
fact,
do
justify
some
exceptions
to
the
field
preemption.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
more
honest...
that's...
that's
a
more
honest
explanation.
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
the
lower
courts
didn't
get
into
any
of...
any
of
this,
and
so
far,
no
one
has
mentioned
the
basis
of
their
decision
which
was
section
1018.
so...
so--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
frederick,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that
point
and
if
we
also
agree
that
in
fact
the
court
gave
a
rather
restricted
reading
of
ray,
simply
assuming
that
its
principles
went
no
further
than
the
design
and
construction,
shouldn't
we
simply
at
that
point
vacate
and
send
this
thing
back
rather
than
in
the
first
instance,
as
if
we
were
a
court
of...
of
first
instance,
parse
our
way
through
every
regulation?
unknown
speaker
but
am...
am
i
right
that
if...
that
your
position
is
that
if
we
agree
with
you
on
1018
and
we
agree
with
you
on
the
restricted
reading
given
to
ray,
that
those
two
points
are
sufficient
to
require
vacation
and...
and
remand?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
section
1018,
doesn't...
doesn't
section
1018
support
the
respondent
at
least
to
this
extent?
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
say...
to
be
sure,
it
only
deals
with
the
preemptive
effect
of...
of
that
legislation,
but
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
say
the
state's
authority
to
regulate...
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
say
this
legislation
shall
not
preempt
the
state's
authority
to
regulate
when
there
was
already
no
extant
state
authority
to
regulate
because
of
a
prior
statute.
doesn't
it,
in
effect,
acknowledge
that
under
the
prior
legislation,
there...
there
was
state
authority
to
regulate?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
characterize
then
the
principal
error
of
the
ninth
circuit
with
reference
to
the
savings
clause?
was
it
in
its
conclusion
that
the
savings
clause,
because
it's
in
a
later
act,
shows
that
field
preemption
is
now
in
doubt
or
has
been
narrowed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
there's
a
difference
between--
--mr.
frederick,
doesn't
the...
at
least
common
sense
and
perhaps
some
of
our
earlier
cases
suggest
that
when
you're
talking
about
field
preemption,
you
would
not...
you
would
hesitate
to
apply
it
in
an
area
where
there
are
very
strong
local
interests.
you
know,
supposing
you
say
that
in
a
heavy
fog
in
puget
sound,
coming
into
the
seattle
harbor,
you
have
to
have
a
tug.
i...
i
for
one
would
be
quite
loathe
to
read
some
rather
general
federal
statute
as
having
preempted
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
but
a
very
subordinate
one,
obviously.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
the
international
ramifications
of
saying
that...
of
the
state
of
washington
saying
that
in
a
heavy
fog
coming
into
seattle
harbor,
you
had
to
have
a
tug?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
to
what
extent
do
the
coast
guard
regulations
are...
to
what
extent
are
they
uniform
or
harbor-specific?
unknown
speaker
but
they
might
have
a...
just
to
take
an...
they
might
have
a
regulation
that
would
apply
specifically
to
puget
sound
and
nowhere
else--
unknown
speaker
--to
cover
the
specific--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frederick,
there's
another
difference
between
you
and
mr.
benner.
i
hope
you
clarify
that.
you
say
1018
just
says
no
spill-over
effect
on
the
preexisting
law,
but
he
goes
beyond
that
and
would
like
us
to
say
that
it
doesn't
have
a
savings
effect
even
within
opa
except
for
title
i.
and
your
brief
is
silent
on
that.
do
you
have
a
position?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
said
that
the
ratification
of
an
international
convention
is
sufficient
to
show
field
preemption?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
then...
that
these
new
treaties
and
laws
that
you
refer
to
show
express
preemption?
unknown
speaker
how...
on...
on
what
aspect
of
preemption
then
do
these
international
agreements
and
obligations
bear?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
just
give
effect
to
a
title
ii
field
preemption
that's
already
there,
then
it
doesn't
add
anything
to
the...
to
the
case.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
collins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
opa
and...
what
is
it...
section
1018--
unknown
speaker
--amended
the
pwsa
in
some
way?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
is
it
possible
then
that
that
section
has
any
effect
on
any
preemption
affected
by
pwsa
or
the
other...
or
ptsa?
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
the
treatment
given
by
the
ninth
circuit
to
the
opa
section?
unknown
speaker
it's
very
hard
to
understand
how
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
comports
with
what
we
said
in
ray.
do
you
think
ray
is
still
good
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
thought
there
was
language
in
the
ray
opinion
that
title
ii
has
twin
goals
of
providing
for
vessel
safety
and
protecting
the
marine
environment.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
there
certainly
is
language
in
those
statutes
dealing
with
the
manning
of
vessels
and
vessel
safety.
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
it
appeared,
at
least
to
me,
to
look
to
those
areas
where
congress
required
the
coast
guard
to
make
regulations.
unknown
speaker
and
as
to
that,
i
don't
see
what
room
is
left.
i
mean,
congress
spoke
pretty
clearly
there.
unknown
speaker
but
they
also
invalidated,
didn't
they,
the
requirement
that
tankers
carry
state
licensed
pilots?
and
that
requirement
has
nothing
to
do
with
design
and
construction.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
ray
was
not
limited
to
design
and
construction.
in
quoting
the
statute,
in
quoting
3703(a),
at
least
three
times
the...
justice
white's
opinion
puts
together
operations,
as
well
as
design
and
construction.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
it
right
that
you've
now
given
up
on
the
ninth
circuit?
[laughter]
i
took
their
reasoning
as
being
a...
a
new
act,
the
oil
spill
act,
has
a
savings
clause
applicable
to
the
oil
spill
act,
and
therefore
all
these
other
acts
which
don't
have
the
savings
clause
are
treated
just
as
if
they
did.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
that's
what
they
said.
and
i
couldn't
think
of
any
justification
for
that
whatsoever,
and
i
take
it
you
can't
either.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
if
we're
back
to
ray...
if
we're
back
to
ray,
then...
then,
as
i
read
ray...
i'm
quite
interested...
now,
we're
keeping
the
oil
spill
act
out
of
this.
we're
back
to
ray.
i
thought
that
ray
simply
looked
at
title
ii
and
said
it
all
depends
in
these
areas
whether
the
secretary
issues
a
regulation
or
not,
but
if
he
does
issue
a
regulation,
that's
the
end
of
that.
now,
i
thought
that
they
got
that
from
a
provision
of
the
statute
that
said
the
secretary
shall
prescribe
regulations
for
the
design,
construction,
alteration,
repair,
maintenance,
operation,
equipping,
personnel
qualification,
and
manning
of
tank
vessels.
and
if
i'm
right
so
far...
and
i'm
looking
to
you
to
say
i'm
not...
then
i
can't
understand
what
the
difference
could
possibly
be
between
design
regulations,
which
are
right
there
in
the
statute,
followed
by
manning
regulations,
which
are
four
words
over,
followed
by
these
other
subjects,
and
when
i
look
at
the
titles
of
your
regulations,
i
see
work
hours,
languages,
training,
engineering,
watch
practices,
operating
procedures.
in
other
words,
they
all
fit
right
within
those
words.
so,
it
seems
like
ray,
q.e.d.
that's
the
end
of
it.
we'll
send
it
back
so
you
get
a
chance
to
argue,
but...
but
nonetheless,
it
doesn't
look
good
for
you.
now,
i'm--
[laughter]
okay,
at
least
as
it
responds
to
those.
so
now,
what...
what
are
your...
what
are
your
responses
to
that?
unknown
speaker
a
little
ambiguity.
neither
of
us
means
the
word
shall
is
their
field
preemption;
rather,
the
word
shall
prescribe
regulations
is
there
and
preemption
if,
and
only
if,
the
secretary
decides
to
issue
a
regulation.
so,
we're
both
at
that
point.
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you...
now
you're
going
to
say
even
if
the
secretary
does
issue
a
regulation,
still
there
is
not
necessarily
preemption.
unknown
speaker
now,
you...
you
also
disavow
that
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
they
argued
that
the
regulations
did
not
preempt.
the
ninth
circuit
said--
unknown
speaker
--because
there's
no...
no
preemptive
authority
for
the
regulations,
if
i...
if
i
read
the
opinion
correctly.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
analyze
any
of
the
regulations--
unknown
speaker
--because
they
said
the
coast
guard
had
no
authority
to
issue
regulations
that
would
preempt
state
law.
unknown
speaker
it
fully
explains
why
they
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
what
the
regulations
said.
they
didn't
even
look
at
them--
unknown
speaker
--having
concluded
that
the
coast
guard
was
acting
outside
its
delegated
authority,
insofar
as
it
tried
to
preempt.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i...
i
thought
the
opinion
was
quite
clear.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
do.
and
in
defense
of
that
court,
can
you
tell
us
whether
the
ninth
circuit
got
this
idea
of
the
sweeping
savings
provision
of
1018...
did
they
get
that
idea...
did
they
make
it
up,
or
wasn't
it
argued
to
them
by
the
state
of
washington?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
part
of...
part
of
my...
my
point
was...
was
institutional.
i
mean,
we
do
not
sit
as
a
court
of
first
instance.
and
a
great
deal
of
what
we're
arguing
about
now
was...
was
never
addressed
because
of
what
seems
to
be
these
threshold...
perhaps
threshold
errors
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
mean,
you're
saying
that
you
should
hold
them
to
some
kind
of
waiver.
if
your
colleagues
here
in
the
state
attorneys
general's
office
and
they
had
forgotten
to
rave...
to
raise
an...
no
exhaustion
point
in
a...
in
a
habeas
case,
they
would
be
up
here
arguing
interests
of
comity
of
the
state
of
washington
and
the
big
exception
to
waiver.
now,
does
canada
and
belgium
and
280
sovereign
nations
not
have
some
kind
of...
of
right
to
assert
their
comity
in
light
of
their
sovereignty
in
respect
to
these
technical
matters
like
waiver?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
just
saying
they
hadn't
put
in
the
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--and
they
didn't...
they
didn't
take
in
the
international
significance
of
this.
there
are...
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
in
the
courts
and
they...
they
didn't
apparently
take
in
the
significance
of
it
till
it
got
to
the
appellate
level.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that's
quite
consistent
with
the
record
because
at
page
30a
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
they...
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
intertanko
did
call
attention
to
several
regulations
as
being
expressly
preempted
by
coast
guard
regulations,
identified
some
in
the
text
and
some
in
the
footnote.
so,
i
don't
think
you
can
tell
us
that
the
specific
conflicts
with
coast
guard
regulation
wasn't
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
lower
court.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
but
that
fall-back
argument
is
before
us.
unknown
speaker
and
they
responded
to
the
argument
not
by
disagreeing
on
the
conflict,
but
by
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
the
preemption
by
regulations
does
not
occur
if
the
agency
is
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
its
delegated
powers.
and
that
was,
as
i
understood
their
reasoning...
and
i...
i'm
still
not
clear
whether
you
agree
with
that
position
or
don't.
unknown
speaker
by
virtue
of
the
coast
guard
regulation.
unknown
speaker
well.
unknown
speaker
congress
could
do
that.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
congress
didn't
delegate
that
function
to
the
coast
guard.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
congress
could
delegate
that
to
the
coast
guard
if
it
chose.
unknown
speaker
what
if
congress
said
in
the...
in
the
delegation
of
the
coast
guard,
we
authorize
the
coast
guard
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
states
should
be
excluded
from
this
field?
unknown
speaker
but
otherwise
you
say
we
should
look
at
title
i
and...
and
ask
whether
the
coast
guard
implicitly
meant
to
preclude
the
states?
unknown
speaker
is...
is
uniformity
of
maritime
regulation
an
important
objective?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
drug
testing
requirement?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
would
relate
directly
to
manning
the
vessels
in
an
area
where
congress
has
told
the
coast
guard
to
regulate
and
the
coast
guard
has
said
what
it--
unknown
speaker
--not
on
land,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the...
if
the
coast
guard
regulation
is
not
a
manning
requirement,
where
did
they
get
the
authority
to
regulate
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that...
that
the
authority
to
issue
manning
regulations
would
not
have
authorized
them
to
give...
to
issue
the
drug
and
alcohol
regulation,
except
for
the...
unless
that
later
statute
had
been
passed.
that's
not
persuasive--
unknown
speaker
--what
about...
what
about
the
requirement
that
says,
as
they
describe
it,
all
licensed
deck
officers...
i
guess
that
means
every
one...
must
speak
english
and
speak
a
language
understood
by
all
the
crew,
which
could
be
14
different
languages.
it
may
be
rather
hard
to
find
somebody
who...
i
don't
think
any
of
us
could
satisfy
that
requirement,
but
we're
not
applying
to
be
a
deck
officer.
but...
but--
[laughter]
--the...
i
mean,
what
about
that
one?
i
mean,
that
sounds
a
little
hard
to
meet.
unknown
speaker
and
it
also
sounds
like
a
manning
requirement
and
it
also
doesn't,
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--was
that
based
on
that
thing
that
happened
down
in
new
orleans
where...
where--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
getting
back
to
this
distinction
in
drug
regulations
where
it
applies
to
vessels
from...
i
guess
american
flag
vessels
and
not
others,
if
it's
a
local
regulation,
what...
what
authority
does
the
state
have
to
make
a
distinction
for
its
regulations
depending
on
the
origins
of...
of
the
ship?
it
seems
to
me
that's
inherently
an
interstate
determination.
unknown
speaker
just
as
long
as
it's
foreign
flag.
i
want
to
just
be
a
little...
does...
is
washington
saying
everybody
on
a
foreign
flag
vessel
has
to
speak
english?
unknown
speaker
or
everybody
has
to
speak
french?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they
saying?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
mean,
they
have,
you
know,
thousands
of
people.
they
have
deck
hands.
some
come
from
france.
some
come
from
belgium.
some
come
from...
i
don't
know...
48,000
different
countries,
and
maybe
not
everybody
speaks
english
down
there.
maybe
there's
somebody
who
doesn't.
so,
do
they
flunk
if
they
don't?
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
you
mentioned
and
you
placed
considerable
reliance
on
askew.
and
as
i
understand
that
case,
it
involved
only
what
is
now
an
undisputed
matter,
that
is,
that
the
states
can
impose
additional
liability
for
an
oil
spill.
i...
i
didn't
understand
the
holding
to
be
dealing
with
anything
pre-incident.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
