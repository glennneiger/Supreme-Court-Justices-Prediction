mr.
william
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
washington's
authority
to
prevent
oil
spills
from
tankers
traveling
on
puget
sound
and
in
the
columbia
river.
congress
has
not
expressly
preempted
the
state's
authority
to
regulate
companies
that
operate
oil
tankers
in
washington,
nor
do
we
believe
has
congress
impliedly
expressed
a
broad
intent
to
preempt
state
authority
in
this
field.
washington's
prevention
rules
complement
coast
guard
rules
and
the
international
regime,
and
there
is
no
conflict.
i
want
to
just
spend
a
moment
talking
about
the
state's
regulatory
regime
because,
contrary
i
think
to
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
intertanko,
it
is
a
complementary
system,
not
a
conflict
system.
first
of
all,
we
regulate
by
requiring
the
owners
and
operators
of
tankers
to
file
a
prevention
plan,
and
that
plan
must
meet
certain
requirements.
those
requirements
were
developed
in...
in
consultation
with
both
the
coast
guard
and
the
tanker
industry,
and
they
involve
a
lot...
many
of
the
rules
involve
simply
operations
on
local
waters,
that
is,
the
twisting,
narrow
waters
of
puget
sound.
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
justice
o'connor,
our
position
is
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
would
be
the
same
even
if
section
1018
had
not
been
enacted,
but
we--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
observed
that
the...
section
1018
we
believe
is
an
exclamation
point
indicating
congress'
intent
not
to
preempt
state
regulation
in
this
area.
i
mean,
in
the
briefs
of
the
united
states
and
intertanko,
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
since
the
constitution
was
adopted,
there
have
been
regulations
in
this
area.
and
sometimes
state
regulations
in
this
area
have
been
struck
down.
other
times
state
regulations
in
this
area
have
been
upheld.
congress
is
well
aware
of
that
fact,
and
yet
congress
has
never,
in
the
ptsa
or
any
of
the
statutes
that
follow
it,
expressly
preempted
the
state
from
regulating
in
this
area.
and
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
congress
certainly
knows
how
to
express
that
intent.
mr.
william
b.
collins
oh,
yes,
ray
is
good
law
and
we
rely
on
ray
heavily.
but
the
difference
between
the
parties
i
think
on
ray
is
that
essentially
the
government
and
intertanko
view
ray
or
view
title...
title
ii,
what
is
in
46
u.s.c.
3703(a),
as
a
labeling
exercise.
that
is
to
say,
if
they
can
call
a
requirement
manning
or
personnel,
then
they
say
that
it's
preempted.
but
we
believe
that
ray
was
not
a
labeling
exercise.
the
court
in
ray
was
very
careful
to
do
what
you
have
to
do
in
a
field
preemption
case.
it
took...
looked
at
the
purpose
and
character
of
the
federal
rule;
that
is,
the
purpose
and
character
of
the
design
and
construction
requirement
and
concluded
that
in
that
area
there
was
no
room
for
state
regulation
because
after--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes.
but
in
analyzing...
in
other
words,
in
ray
the
court
didn't
simply
say
everything
listed
in
title
ii
is
subject
to
field
preemption.
rather,
it
looked
carefully
at
the
area
of
design
and
construction
and
decided
there
was
no
room
for
the
states.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think...
i
think
that
that
is
not
the
correct
reading
of
ray
because
the
court
was
very...
i
mean,
for
example,
operations
is
listed
in
title
ii,
but
the
court
was
very
careful
in
ray
to
distinguish
design
and
construction
from
other
kinds
of
requirements.
so,
even
though
there
was
a
specific
statute
about
pilotage,
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
point
out
that
pilotage
was
not
a
design
and
construction
requirement.
it
looked
at
the
tug
escort
requirement
and
said
tug
escort
is
not
a
design
and
construction
requirement.
so,
the
court
didn't--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--for
the
coast-wise
trade.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
ray
the...
the
pilotage
requirement
for
the
coast-wise
trade
was
struck
down
because
of
a
specific
pilotage
statute
enacted
by
congress
and...
and
that's
in
fact
why
the
requirement
for
a
pilot
for
the
registered
vessels
was...
was
upheld
because
of
a
specific
statute.
but
in
spite
of
that
specific
statute,
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
contrast
a
pilotage
requirement
from
a
design
and
construction
requirement.
so,
we
believe,
when
you're
looking
at
field
preemption
in
title
ii,
it
is
not
simply
a
labeling
exercise,
but
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
what
is
the
federal
purpose.
now--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
take
your
point,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
my
response
to
that
is
that
that
wasn't
the
analysis
in
ray,
justice
breyer.
the...
the
court
did
not
say...
i
will...
i
will
agree
that
the
court
in
ray
did
make
a
reference
to
the
mandatory
nature,
did
point
out
that
title
ii
used
the
word
shall.
but
it
didn't
say,
okay,
how
are
we
going
to
analyze
this?
this
statute
says,
the
secretary
shall
adopt
regulations,
the
list
that
you
gave
me.
end
of
case.
we
don't
need
to
say
anything
more
because
that
shall
means
that
there
is
field
preemption
of
everything
that
follows
that
word.
that's
not
what
the
court
did
in
ray.
it
went
to
take
a
look
at
the
nature
of
the
design
and
construction
requirement
and
indicated
that
state
interference...
state
design
and
construction
requirements
would
interfere
with
that
federal
purpose.
i
mean,
you
can't
redesign
your
oil
tanker.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
i'm
not--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--not
necessarily
field
preemption,
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
if
the
secretary
issues
a
regulation...
i
mean,
you've
got
to
take
a
look
to
see
whether
there's
a
conflict.
we...
under
the
supremacy
clause,
it's
clear
that
we
can't
be
in
conflict
with
a
regulation
issued
by
the
coast
guard.
i
mean,
the
easy
example--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
i
think--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--justice
stevens,
are
you
speaking
of
the...
the
express...
their...
their
discussion
about
the
coast
guard's
statements
of
express
preemption?
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes.
well,
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
is--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--no.
mr.
william
b.
collins
see,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
that
is
a
characterization
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
is
not
quite
accurate.
at
least
what
i
would
say--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--it--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
what
the
ninth...
in
the
action
below,
as
mr.
benner
said,
their
fall-back
argument
was
that
some
regulations
were
expressly
preempted
by
the
coast
guard.
and
the
only
thing
that
they
pointed
to
was
that
the
coast
guard
had
said
we
expressly
intend
to
preempt.
i
mean,
that
was
the
limit
of
their
analysis.
they
didn't
look
to
see
whether
there
was
a
conflict
or
whether
there
was
any
other
problem.
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
just
because
the
coast
guard
declares
preemption
doesn't
mean
there
is
preemption.
obviously,
that's
an
important
indicator.
if
the
court...
if
the
coast
guard
says,
we
think
our
regulations
preempt,
then,
i
mean,
that
certainly
is
an
important
decision
about...
an
important
factor
in
discussing
preemption.
but
we
have...
think
you
have
to
go
out
and
still
take
a
look
at
the
regulations
themselves.
mr.
william
b.
collins
this
case
is
in
a--
[laughter]
i...
i
don't
think
they
quite
got
it
from
us,
justice
ginsburg.
but
this...
this
case
is
in...
in
a
somewhat
peculiar
posture
because
of
the
way
that
it
was
tried.
when
the
case
was
first
filed,
intertanko
brought
the
action.
they
invited
the
united
states
to
come
in
at
the
district
court
level.
the
united
states
declined
to
do
so
for
reasons
that
i
don't
know.
and
intertanko's
theory
before
the
ninth
circuit
and...
and
the
district
court,
as
before
this
court,
is
field
preemption,
sort
of
the
home
run
ball.
so,
they
did
not
go
through
and
try
to
argue
specific
conflict
preemption.
they
didn't
try
to
talk
about
places
where
the
washington
rule
and
the
international
rule
were,
you
know,
in
conflict.
they
didn't
build
a
record
on
that
point.
later
at
the
ninth
circuit,
the
united
states
entered
the
case
and,
frankly,
in
their
briefs
have
a
lot
of
what
they
say
are
illustrative
examples
of
potential
conflicts
that
might
exist.
but
that's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
and
that
wasn't
raised
below.
so,
justice
souter,
you
had
talked
about
what
should
happen
to
this
case
if
things
go
south
for
the
state
of
washington
and
whether
it
should
be
remanded
to...
to
sort
that
out.
but
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate
in
this
case.
i
mean,
i
think
the
parties
here
had
their
day
in
court.
they
didn't
build
a
record
and--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--so,
from
our
point
of
view,
your
honor,
what
we
think
should
happen
in
this
case
is
the
court
should
rule
that
there
is
no
broad
field
preemption
of
all
of
the
items
that
are
listed
in
title
ii
of
the
ports
and
waterways
safety
act
and
essentially
affirm
the
result
at
the
ninth
circuit.
later,
if
intertanko--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
of
it
so
much
as...
as
an
issue
of
waiver.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--but
it...
it's...
what
i
would
direct
you
to,
i
guess,
is
this
court's
decision
in
askew
where
one
of
the
questions
in
askew
was
whether
the
state
of
florida
could
require
certain
kinds
of
equipment
on
the
vessel
for
purposes
of
response,
and
the
court
said
we're
not
going
to
engage
in
speculation
at
this
point
about
how
this
conflict
might
work
out.
and
later
if
a
case
comes
to
us
that
presents
that
conflict
or
comes
to
the
courts
that
presents
that
conflict,
then
that's
when
it
should
be
resolved.
and
we
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
lower
court,
justice
stevens,
with
mr.
benner's
fall-back
argument.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--yes.
no,
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
i
think
i
got...
i
think
i
was
taken
off
track
when
i
was
responding
to
your
question,
so
let
me
try
to
get
back
to
it.
the
only
thing
that
was
argued
below
i
believe
on
those
points
was
the
simple
declaration
by
the
coast
guard
that
the
state
should
be
excluded.
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
said--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--by
virtue
of
the
declaration.
mr.
william
b.
collins
but...
well...
but
i
think
there's
a
difference,
your
honor.
the
question
is...
i
do
not
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
coast
guard
regulations
could
not
preempt
state
authority,
and
indeed,
if
you
read
it
that
way,
we
would
disagree
with
it.
it's
clear
that
coast
guard
regulations
would
preempt
the
state
if
there's
a...
if
there's
a
conflict.
but
to
simply
declare...
simply
declare
that
the
state
is
preempted,
the
ninth
circuit
indicated...
and
we
believe
is
correct...
is
beyond
coast
guard
authority.
we
do
not
believe
congress
delegated
to
the
coast
guard
the
authority
to
declare
field
preemption,
if
you
will.
mr.
william
b.
collins
congress
could
do
that.
mr.
william
b.
collins
right,
for
field
preemption.
mr.
william
b.
collins
and
so...
and
that's
of
some
concern
to
us
because
if
that's
the
rule,
then
the
coast
guard
can
eliminate
state
participation
by
simply
adopting
a
rule
saying
we
intend
that
no
state
shall
adopt
any
rules
or
regulations
pertaining
to
oil
tankers.
and
we
believe
that
just
that
declaration
is
beyond
the
coast
guard
authority.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
think
congress
could
do
that
if
it...
congress
could
itself
say
we
intend
to
exclude
the
states
from
this
field,
and
they
could--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i
think
that
would
be
kind
of
an
express
statement
that
would
give
the
coast
guard
the
kind
of
authority
that
we
do
not
believe
that
it
has
been
given.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no.
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
under...
frankly,
under
both
title
i
and
title
ii
is
look
to
see
whether
there's
a
conflict;
that
is,
look
at
the
purpose
and
object
of
the
congressional
enactment
and
the
coast
guard
regulation
and
look
to
see
if
state
law
is
preventing
the
achieving
of
that
objective,
either
through
physical
impossibility...
and
of
course,
in
this
case,
there's
no
contention
of
physical
impossibility...
or
through
preventing
the
coast
guard
from
achieving
some
important
objective.
and
that
kind
of
a
case
was
not...
was
not
the
case
that
was
made
below.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
i
think
that
uniformity
is
a...
is...
is
an
important
factor
in
places
where
uniformity
is
needed.
let
me
give
you...
let
me
give
you
an
example
about
the
certificates
that...
that
counsel
for
the
government
talked
about.
in
the
international
regime
with
certificates,
there
are
three
kinds
of
certificates.
one
is
for
the
design
and
construction,
so
a
flag
state
will
certify
that
the
design
of
the
ship
is
proper.
there's
also
a
certificate
for
manning,
which
is
the
complement
of
the
crew,
which
is
you
need
one
master,
one
chief
mate,
a
certain
number
of
officers,
a
certain
number
of
other
crew,
and
that
for
a
tanker
of
a
certain
size,
there's
a
certificate
that
says
this
is
the...
the
crew
that
is
required.
and
then
there
are
third
certificates
which
are
essentially
licenses
for
the
mariners,
the
crew
of
those.
uniformity
would
probably
dictate
that
a
state
could
not
say...
if
the
coast
guard
says
the
crew
of
the
tanker
should
be
60,
i
think
it
would...
a
state
would
be
preempted
from
saying,
no,
the
crew
of
a
tanker
has
to
be
70.
for
like
design
and
construction,
it's
hard
to
change
the
composition
of
the
crew,
that
is,
the
number
of
the
crew,
when
they
go
from
san
francisco
to
seattle
or
come
from
france
to
seattle.
but
that's
very
different...
and
we
don't
do
that.
but
that's
very
different
from
saying,
once
you
have
your
certified
ship
and
your
certified
crew
and
the
crew
have
the
proper
licenses,
that
when
they
come
to
washington,
they
need
a
tug
escort.
they
need
a
third
officer
on
the
bridge
during
restricted
visibility.
those
things
do
not
interfere
with
the
necessary
uniformity
that
probably
is
required.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
the
drug
testing
requirement
is
one
where
there
is
no
international
standard.
the
treaties
are
silent
on
the
drug
testing
issue,
and
it's
a
place
where
the...
intertanko
has
relied
on
the
express
statement
of
the
coast
guard
to
force
the
state
out
of
that
area.
but
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
express
statements
is
it's
unclear
to
us
exactly
why
foreign
flag--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
manning
requirement.
i
mean,
we're
not
saying
that...
what
we're...
we
have...
washington
has...
the
drug...
the
drug
and
alcohol
has
two
parts.
the
first
is
a
local
part.
we
have
zero
tolerance
for
drug
and
alcohol
in
washington,
so
you
can't...
obviously,
you
can't
use
illegal
drugs
anywhere,
and
you
can't
drink
in
washington
waters.
the
coast
guard
regulation
is
more
flexible.
it
allows--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--no.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
[laughter]
the
other
part
is
a
testing
requirement.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
on
the
drug
and
alcohol
one--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--they
actually
got
that
from
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1990
because
there's
a
specific
provision
in
opa
'90...
and
i
think
it's...
let's
see.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
accurate,
your
honor.
but...
but
part
of
the
reason
that
they
did
it
is
because
congress
told
them
to
in
opa
'90.
but
the
difference
is
the
coast
guard...
the
big
difference
is
the
coast
guard
tests
u.s.
flag...
requires
testing
of
u.s.
flag
vessels.
it
doesn't
require
testing
of
foreign
flag
vessels.
but
we
don't
see
that
there's
any
relationship
between
that
and
protecting
the
environment,
running
a
ship,
safety--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
your--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
your
honor,
in
that
situation,
we
think
the
government
is
simply
mistaken.
again,
this
may
be
the
problem
with
not
having
had
them
at
the
district
court.
we
have
the
same
requirement
for
language
that
the
international
standard
is.
so,
a
deck
officer
doesn't
have
to
be
able
to
speak
14
languages,
but
there
has
to
be
some
common
language
that
the
deck
officer
and
the
crew
speak
so
when
the
deck
officer
gives
an
order,
the
crew
can
carry
it
out.
if
the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--oh,
where
they
ran
into
the
shopping
center?
mr.
william
b.
collins
well--
[laughter]
that...
our...
i
think
our
regulation
was
in
place
before
that
occurred,
but
that's
the...
that's
the
kind
of
concern.
and
in
our...
in
the
briefs,
we've
talked
about
difficulties
in
washington
with
people
not
being
able
to
speak
english.
mr.
william
b.
collins
oh,
no,
your
honor.
it's
the
united
states
that
makes
the
distinction.
the
united
states
requires
testing
of
u.s.
flag
vessels
and
does
not
require
testing
of
foreign
flag
vessels.
the
washington
rule
requires
testing
of
both
united
states
flag
vessels
and
foreign
flag
vessels.
and
part
of
the
reason
is
because
we
can't
think
of
any
safety
reason
why...
you
know,
do
foreign
flag
crews
hold
their
liquor
better?
mr.
william
b.
collins
no.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no.
mr.
william
b.
collins
the
requirement
is
the
officers
have
to
be
able
to
speak
english
enough
to
be
able
to
communicate.
there's
sort
of
a--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--the
deck
officers
have
to
be
able
to
speak
english,
and
they
also
have
to
be
able
to
speak
a
common
language
understood
by
the
crew.
and
that's
the
same
requirement
that
the
international
requirement
imposes.
and
i
want
to
talk
just
for
a
second
about
the...
the
international
requirements.
mr.
william
b.
collins
your
honor,
i
think
my
reference
to
askew
was
a...
was
to
argue
that
this
court
shouldn't
just
send
this
back
to
determine
conflict
preemption
because
the
conflicts
that
the
government
raises
are
speculative
and
weren't
raised
below,
and
those
are
better
left
for
another
day.
i
mean,
i
don't...
askew
i
think
confirms
that
states
can
regulate
in
the
maritime
area,
but
i
mean,
it's
not
directly...
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
different
kinds
of
requirements.
so,
you're
correct
about
that.
the...
the
government
has...
has
talked
about
these
certificates
that
i
talked
about
a
little
bit
earlier
as
a
license
and
has
said
that
states
cannot
impose
any
kind
of
licensing...
once
something
is
licensed,
then
that's
the
end
of
it
and
states
can't
regulate.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
simply
not
correct.
if
a
state,
as
i
said
earlier,
if
a
foreign
flag
tanker
has
a
license,
it
can
still
be
subject
to
nondiscriminatory
environmental
regulations
imposed
by
the
state.
and
this
court
itself
in
the
florida
lime
case
indicated
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
license
didn't
mean
that
you
couldn't
have
other
kinds
of
state
regulations.
certainly
in
the
ogden
v.
gibbons
case,
referred
to
by
counsel,
there
the
state
of
new
york
was
trying
to
create
a
monopoly
and
exclude
commerce.
quite
a
different
system
here,
where
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
preserve
the
ability
of
the
state
to
regulate
in...
in
a
couple
of
areas.
first
of
all,
things
that
are
local
to
washington
waters
that
relate
directly
to
the
unique
areas
of
puget
sound,
and
secondly,
we
have
requirements
that
mirror
international
standards.
we
think
this
is
awfully
important
because
it's
a
second
set
of
eyes
on
the...
on
the
ground...
at
sea.
we
conduct
annual
safety
inspections
to
see
if
tankers
are
complying
with
their
prevention
plans.
in
washington
we
work
very
cooperatively
with
the
coast
guard
people
there.
we
give
them
information,
they
give
us
information.
the
whole
system
of
cooperative
federalism
working
together
we
think
will
make
the
waters
safer,
and
ultimately
we
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
it
didn't
intend
for
the
coast
guard
to
be
exclusive
except
in
areas
where
it
needed
to
be
exclusive,
the
kinds
of
certificates
that
i
talked
about
earlier.
therefore,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
result
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
continue
to
give
washington
the
authority
to
regulate
and
preserve
the
quality
of
our
waters.
