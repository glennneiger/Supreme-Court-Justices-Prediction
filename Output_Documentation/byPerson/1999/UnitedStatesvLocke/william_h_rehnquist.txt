thank
you,
mr.

the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
first
one
is
united
states
against
locke,
no.98-1701.
concerned
about
oil
spills
which
could
be
catastrophic
for
its
sea
coasts
and
inland
waters,
the
state
of
washington
has
enacted
comprehensive
laws
seeking
to
regulate
oil
tankers
entering
its
waters.
these
waters
include
puget
sound
in
the
strait
of
san
juan
de
fuca,
which
is
the
way
you
get
from
the
pacific
ocean
into
puget
sound.
in
1978,
in
a
case
called
ray
versus
atlantic
richfield,
the
court
held
with
certain
laws
enacted
by
washington
to
regulate
tankers,
were
preempted
by
federal
laws.
this
case
involves
laws
regulating
tankers
that
washington
enacted
well
after
our
decision
in
ray.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
all
but
one
of
washington's
new
laws.
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
authored
by
justice
kennedy,
we
now
reverse
them
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court's
opinion
reaffirmed
that
general
analytical
structure
in
the
essential
holding
of
the
ray
case.
in
light
of
an
established
federal
and
international
regulatory
scheme,
we
hold
that
various
washington
laws
discussed
in
the
opinion
are
preempted.
preemption
principles
respect
the
established
federal
state
balance
in
matters
of
maritime
commerce.
that
balance
recognizes
subjects
as
to
which
the
states
retain
concurrent
powers
and
those
that
were
which
the
federal
authority
displaces
state
control.
the
opinion
discusses
in
detail
for
separate
washington
tanker
rules,
all
of
which
we
find
to
be
preempted
by
federal
law.
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
other
washington
tanker
rule
should
be
declared
preempted
as
well.
these
questions
we
leave
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
on
remand.
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
