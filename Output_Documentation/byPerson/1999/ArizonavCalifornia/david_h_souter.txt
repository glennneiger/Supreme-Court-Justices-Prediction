but
even...
even
on
the
indian
claims
act
preclusion,
shouldn't
we
consider
in
fact...
or
may
we
not
at
least
consider,
for
whatever
value
it
may
have,
the...
the
amount
of
money
that
they
got?
your...
your
brother
has
pointed
out
to
us
that
on
page
10a
of
the...
the
red
brief,
the
terms
of
the
settlement
are
set
out.
the
terms
of
the
settlement
cover
occupational
trespass
damage,
lack
of...
loss
of
rents,
as
well
as
certain
takings
for
the
canal,
and
levies
and
so
on.
and
they
got
$
15
million
for
that,
which
suggests
to
me
that
if
there
had
been
a
settlement
which
took
into...
which...
which
had
been
a
settlement
for
a
taking
and
had
valued
the
land
in
fee,
the
amount
of
the
settlement
would
have
been
more
than
$
15
million.
can
we
not
bear
in
mind
the
amount
that
they
got
and
say
that
tends
to
support
the
argument
that,
despite
the
language
and
despite
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
only
thing
they
were
settling,
in
effect,
was
an
occupational
claim,
a
trespass
kind
of
claim,
plus
a
few
incidental
takings?
is...
is
that
an
illegitimate
line
of
reasoning?

justice

because
you
can't
have
it...
you
say
all
of
the
above.
the
answer
to
that
is
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
they...
they
settled
on...
on
a...
if...
if
they
had...
if
they
had
come
up
with...
let's
put
it
this
way.
if
they
had
come
up
with
a
settlement
that
said,
we
don't
know,
but
regardless
of
whether
your
claims
are
for
trespass
or
whether
your
claims
are
for
taking,
we'll
give
you
this
and
you
take
this
and
you
go
away,
that
would
have
been
a
situation
in
which
there
would
have
been
total
ambiguity
and
there
would
have
been
no
way
to
go
behind
the
general
language
that
you
quote.
here,
however,
there
is
a
way
to
go
behind
it,
and
if...
if
you
accept
the
general
principle
that
you
can't
have
it
both
ways,
why
not
go
behind
it
and
give
effect
to
what
they
actually
agreed
upon?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
figure...
take
the
$
15
million
as
support
for
the
claim
that
they...
the
argument
that
they
are
making
here,
that
the
only
thing
they
settled
was
the
trespass
claim
plus
incidentals.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
that,
the
$15
million
is
probably
good
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
you
can't
reason
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
mean
your
title
is
extinguished?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
means
you
don't
have
a
claim
against
the
government.
that's
different
from
saying
your
title
is
extinguished.
