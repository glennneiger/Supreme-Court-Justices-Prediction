mr.
jerome
c.
muys
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
states
of
arizona
and
california,
the
coachella
valley
water
district,
and
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
all
support
special
master
mcgarr's
report
and
recommendations.
we
are
pleased
that
we
were
able
to
resolve
the
50-year-old
water
rights
disputes
on
the
fort
mojave
and
colorado
river
reservations
and
obtain
the
special
master's
endorsement
of
those
settlements.
we
urge
the
court
to
approve
them
also,
and
further
to
adopt
the
special
master's
disposition
of
the
government's
and
the
quechan
tribe's
additional
water
right
claim
for
certain
disputed
boundary
lands
on
the
fort
yuma
indian
reservation.
the
fort
yuma
controversy
over
the
title
status
to
the
25,000
acres
we've
heard
about,
relating
to
a
cession
of
those
lands
by
the
tribe
under
an
1893
agreement
approved
by
congress
in
1894
and
on
which
the
tribes
and
the
government
rely,
has
been
with
us
almost
for
100
years.
it
was
seemingly
resolved
in
a
1936
decision
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
approving
solicitor
margold's
opinion
which
found
that
the
cession
under
the
1893
agreement
was
effective
and
had
conveyed
title
to
these
lands
to
the
government.
indeed,
the
tribe
relied
on
that
as
a
final
decision
by
the
secretary
in
filing
its
1951
petition
with
the
indian
claims
commission
in
which
it
sought
compensation
for
what
it
called
the
wrongful
expropriation
of
those
25,000
acres
of
land.
the
government's
answer
to
that
position
before
the
indian
claims
commission
asserted
that
the
government
had
title
to
those
lands
and
indeed
had
performed
all
of
its
obligations
under
the
1893
agreement.
the
government's
later
assertion
of
a
winner's
reserved
water
right
for
the
fort
yuma
indian
reservation
when
it
intervened
in
arizona
i
2
years
later
in
1953
proceeded
on
that
same
premise.
and
this
court's
decision
in
1963
awarded
the
government
its
full
claim
for
the
fort
yuma
reservation
for
all
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage
within
the
fort
yuma
reservation
as
determined
by
the
secretary's
1936
decision.
20
years
later
in
1983,
the
tribe's
indian
claims
commission
action
finally
culminated
in
a
settlement
judgment,
approved
by
the
claims
court
which
awarded
the
tribes
$
15
million
for,
quote,
all
rights,
claims,
or
demands
which
the
tribe
has
asserted
or
could
have
asserted,
closed
quote,
in
that
action
which
plainly
included
the
tribe's
claim
for
the
taking
of
the
disputed
boundary
lands.
the
language
of...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that
is
correct,
justice...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
it
had
a
whole
array
of
claims
in
their
petition,
including
all
the
language
i
think
from
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
unfair
and
dishonorable
dealings
with
the
government.
it
had
a
whole
laundry
list
of
claims,
but
the...
the
principal
claim
was
that
the...
the
disputed
lands
had
been
unfairly
taken
under
the
1893
cession
agreement.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
no.
if...
if
the
tribe
had
had
only
a
claim
for
trespass
by
the
government
and
got
paid
for
it
and
still
retained
title
to
its
lands,
there's
no
doubt
that
if
some
other
settlers
or
some
third
parties
had
trespassed
on
their
land,
they
would
have
a
further
claim
against
those
third
parties.
but
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
when
you
bring
a
claim
for
a
taking
of
aboriginal
or
trust
lands
and
you
get
an
agreement,
either
an
adjudicated
or
a
settlement
agreement,
that
is
paid...
that
congress
pays,
that
does
not...
not
only
extinguishes
the
claims
against
the
united
states,
it
extinguishes
title
that
the
tribe
had
in
those
reservation...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
they're
something
special
in
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
quite
correct.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the
words
of
that
act
make
it
clear
that
the...
the
claims
brought
by
the
tribe
against
the
united
states
are
extinguished
as
against
the
united
states.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
correct.
but
if
you
talk...
if
the...
if
the
claim
is
for
taking
of
land
and
the
government
pays
for
the
lands
that
were
taken,
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
statute
as
saying
obviously
the
title
to
those
lands
has
been
extinguished.
when
the
tribe
got
money,
they
no
longer
had
title
to
the...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
because
otherwise
the
act's
finality
purposes
would
be
utterly
frustrated.
the
tribes
would
come
in,
get
paid
by
the
government
for
their
claims
for
extinguishing
title,
then
they'd
go
out
and
sue
the
settlers
justice
scalia
mentioned.
they'd
assert
water
rights
for
lands
they
didn't
own
anymore.
they
could
roam...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the
act
does
not...
we
agree
with
the
government
and
the
tribes
that
under
collateral
estoppel
you
need
a
litigated,
adjudicated
issue
before
you...
there's
any
preclusion,
but
not
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
the
indian
claims
commission
act
says
that
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
settle
cases
and
settlement
judgments
are
treated
the
same
as
adjudicated
judgments.
they're
sent
to
congress
and
congress
pays
them.
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
in
united
states
against
dann
in
1985
said
that
when
that
happens,
the
tribe's
title
is
extinguished
by
operation
of
the...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
that's...
that's
the
result
of
the
statute
and
that's
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
have
interpreted
final
judgments
by
the
claims
court
on
indian
claims
commission...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes,
pend
orielle...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
there
were
specific
findings.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
you
have...
you
have
the
judgment
and
the...
i
read
the
part
of
the
judgment
that
says
all
the
tribe's
claims
are...
that
could
have
been
asserted
can
no
longer
be
asserted
against
the
united
states
or
in
any
future
action,
which
we
read
as
against
anybody.
and
that's
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
has
read
it.
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
not
only
is
the
tribe's
title
extinguished
as
against
the
united
states,
but
as
against
third
parties.
and
it's
pend
orielle,
gemmill,
western
shoshones.
we...
we
cite
the
cases
i
think
at
page...
oh,
in
our...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the...
the
cases
the
special
master
relied
on,
gemmill
and
pend
orielle,
were
settlement
judgments,
but
there
had
been
earlier
litigation
on
liability
in
which
there
were
findings
made
by
the
indians
claims
commission.
no
findings
were
made
in
the
quechan
situation
because
they
never
got
to
that
point.
they
did
the...
the
early
stages
on
liability
and
then
the...
the
tribe
moved
to
stay
the
proceedings
while
they
tried
to
get
congress
to
reconvey
the
land
to
them.
congress
refused
to
do
so.
the
tribe
reopened
the...
the
claims
court
proceedings
and
settlement
occurred.
the
settlement
was
prompted
by
this
court's
1983
decision
in
arizona
ii
in
which
the
agreement
that
the
government
says
they
had
with
the
tribe,
that
the
1978
secretarial
order
had
finally
and
conclusively
established
the
tribe's
title
in
these
disputed
lands
was
put
in
serious
doubt
by
this
court.
they
said
that's
just
not
the
way
it
works.
a
series
of
ex
parte
orders
in
which
the
affected
parties,
not
just
landowners,
but
water
users
had
no...
no
role
just
doesn't
cut
it.
and
they
said,
go
back
to
the
district
court
and...
and
finish
that
litigation.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the
fact...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we
say
all
of
the
above,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
five
of
the
laundry
list
of
all
sorts
of
claims,
but
the
judgment
says
that
i
quoted...
and
this
is
at
page
18
of
our
reply
brief.
the
judgment
says
they
got
$
15
million
for
all
rights,
claims,
or
demands
which
the
tribe
has
asserted.
now,
there's
no
room...
wiggle
room
in
there
to
exclude
any
of
the
particular
alternative
theories.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
there
is,
and...
and
i
think
we...
we
tried
to
emphasize,
as
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
think
this
court
in
approving
the
ninth
circuit's
several
dann
decisions
agreed,
that
the
indian
claims
commission
act
is
something
unique.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
we
think
it's
not
appropriate
to
go
behind
the
judgment,
your
honor.
the
tribe
itself...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes,
but
it
also
says
$15
million
is
for
all
claims
that
were
asserted.
why
should
the
court,
why
should
we,
why
should
anyone
have
to
try
and
parcel
out
and
figure
out...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
you
mean
figure
out
what
$
15
million
may
have
bought?
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
actually
on...
on
your
point,
your
honor,
the
tribe
concedes...
and
the
fact
is
that
the...
if
you
were
paying
for
25,000
acres
of
raw
desert
land
that
was
taken
in...
in
1893,
it
would
be
worth...
i
believe
something
in
the
record...
about
50
cents
an
acre.
so,
it
would
be
a
much
lower
level
of
damages
than
what
the
tribe
astutely
sought.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
when
you
look
at
the...
what
happened
after
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
ii,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
government
backed
away
from
what
it
says
was
its
complete
agreement
with
the
tribe
that...
conclusively...
the
tribe
conclusively
got
title
in
the
1978
secretary's
opinion.
they
said,
wait.
this
is
all
very
contingent.
we
may
lose
out
in
san
diego
or
somewhere.
they
didn't
because
they
invoked
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
and
precluded
any
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we
don't
think
they
lead
to
inconsistent
results,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it's
not,
you
know,
coincidental
that
this...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
but
when
the
tribe
brings
a
claim
for
a
taking
and
the
government
pays
them
for
that
claim
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
claims,
and
then
the
government
and
the
tribe
draft
an
unambiguous
judgment
which
says
all
claims,
everything
in
there,
are
gone...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
they
did.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
say
what
they
were
settling
in
the
judgment.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
but...
but
it's
their...
it
was
their
judgment,
and
i
guess
if
the
parole
evidence
rule
means
anything
and
if
finality
of
judgments
means
anything,
as
judge
mcgarr
said,
if
a
final
judgment
that
says
you're
getting
$15
million
and
your
title
is
extinguished
means
anything,
this
argument
is
completely
specious.
that...
the...
the
tribe's
title
is
gone.
they
got
$
15
million,
maybe
not
all
of
it
for
a
taking...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
because
that's
what...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the
ninth
circuit,
which...
this
is
the
circuit
that
done
most
of
the
interpreting
of
the
act,
has
said
that
the
effect
of
the
compensated
judgment
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
when
you
had
a...
a
takings
claim
is
to
extinguish
the
tribe's
title.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
not
in...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
but
what
is...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
the
basis
for
even
going
behind
the
judgment?
a
judgment
says,
all
claims
are
extinguished.
can
that
be
any
clearer?
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
certainly.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
they
didn't...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
was
very
concerned
about
having
finality
come
to
these
indian
claims.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
they
said
it
quiets
title
as
against
the
world
as
far
as
the
tribe's
name.
the
tribe
cannot
assert
title.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
no.
i'm
not
saying
the
world...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
right,
and
the
judgment
extinguished
their
title.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
no.
and
judge
mcgarr
says
if
you
have
title...
the
tribe's
title
extinguished...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
because
the
indian
claims
commission
act
superseded
ordinary
common
law
rules
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
and
established
a
statutory
bar
that
takes
effect
when
payment
is
made
to
a
tribe
for
their
claims.
and
that...
when
their
title
is
extinguished,
that's
the
end
of
it.
they
can't...
they
can't
have
the
government
owning
the
disputed
lands
as
a
result
of
the
title
being
extinguished
and
then
come
against
third
parties
such
as
arizona
and
california
water
users
and
say,
well,
yes,
our
title
is
extinguished
against
the
government...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
but
it
was
resurrected
somehow...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
i'd
be
happy
to
move
that,
your
honor.
i
might
say
that
this
is
not
an
insignificant
amount
of
water
that's
involved
here.
there
are
78,500
acre-feet
of
water
at
issue
on
these
disputed
boundary
lands.
that's
enough
water
to
serve
the
annual
requirements
of
a
city
of
375,000
individuals.
rule
of
thumb
is
an
acre-foot
of
water
covers
the
needs
of
a
family
of
five
for
a
year.
so,
it's
not
an
insignificant
amount
of
water.
it
comes
out
of
the
hides
of
the
arizona
and
southern
california
urban
water
users.
southern
california's
current
supply
is...
is
woefully
inadequate
even
meet
their
current
needs.
arizona's
are
rapidly
reaching
that
same
kind
of
critical
stage.
it's
not
an
insignificant
amount
of
water.
these
indian
rights
would
have
priority
over
all
the
other
water
users
on
the
lower
river.
they'd
have
an
1884
priority
ahead
of
all
the
arizona,
california,
and
nevada
water
users.
but
as
to
our
res
judicata
point,
we...
we
think
the...
the
finality
principles
that
the
court
applied
in
arizona
ii
to
omitted
lands
and
precluded
an
assertion
of
water
rights
for
those
lands
applies
here.
what
the
government
knew
in
1936...
in
1951
when
arizona
against
california
was
filed
and
then
the
government
intervened,
they
knew
that
the
secretary
had
rendered
his
1936
decision
saying
that
the
disputed
lands
were
owned
by
the
government.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
they
were
not.
they
were
within
the
conceded
boundaries.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
it's
true.
there
was
nothing
in
the
'79...
in
the
'64
decree
or
'79
decree
or
'84
decree
that
precluded
this
claim.
the
language
of
the
decree
expressly
left
open...
the
words
of
the
court...
left
open
all
the
boundary
disputes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
no...
no
preclusion
argument
was
made
with
respect
to
boundary
lands,
your
honor.
but
after
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
ii
and
after
the
court's
later
decision
in
nevada
against
united
states,
the
light
finally
dawned
on
the
state
parties
that
there
is
a
valid
preclusion...
or
res
judicata
argument
here
with
respect
to
fort
yuma.
and
here's
the
way
we
think
it
would
work.
when
the
government
was
preparing
its
case
in
arizona
i,
they...
they
made
a
claim
for
all
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage
within
the
reservation.
they
looked
at
the
reservation.
in
one
corner
of
the
reservation
were
a
lot
of
marginally
irrigable
lands.
they
decided
not
to
make
a
claim
for
those,
not
to
overreach
and
prejudice
their
broader
claims.
these
were
the
so-called
omitted
lands.
in
the
other
corner
of
the
reservation,
are
25,000
acres
of
disputed
lands.
the
government
looked
at
the
situation.
they
said,
well,
the
tribe
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
all
asserted
this
much
broader
boundary
and
the
title
to
these
lands,
but
the
secretary
rejected
it.
so,
they
made
a
strategic
litigation
decision
not
to
make
a
claim
for
those
disputed
boundary
lands.
to
us,
it's
the
same
principle.
it's
the
same
bedrock
res
judicata
principle.
what
is
your
claim?
why
did
you
not
make
it?
well,
now
they
say
they
didn't
make
it
because
they
couldn't
make
it.
they...
we
could
not
have
made
a
claim
for...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
correct.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we
do,
your
honor.
but
we're
saying
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
in...
in
trial
courts,
even
though
a
party
may
be
held
to
have
waived
its
claim,
the...
a
district
court
on
its
own
motion
or
an
appellate
court
on
its
own
motion
may
assert
a...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
you
are
the
trial
court.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
so,
we
say
if
you
feel
we
waived
it,
we
urge
you
to,
on
your
own
motion,
invoke
it.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
because
it's...
it's
consistent
with
the
whole
principle
of
res
judicata.
this
litigation
has
to
be
brought
to
an
end.
the
claim...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
we
are
late,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
he
did.
he...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
he
found
we
hadn't
waived
it
and
that
we
weren't
untimely.
we
think
he's
correct.
and...
and
there's
no
prejudice
that
we
can
see.
and
the
government
and
the
tribes
haven't
argued
any
for
the
delay.
so...
and
the
court
has
said
in
connection
in
preclusion
defenses,
the
big
controlling
factor
is
that
the
other
side
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
defend
and
were
they
prejudiced
in
somehow.
those
factors
aren't
present
here.
but
the
special
master,
although
he
held
we
weren't
untimely,
he
ruled
against
our
res
judicata
argument
because
he
said,
oh,
there's
a
new
circumstance.
this
1978
solicitor's
opinion
overruling
three
prior
solicitor's
opinion
which
is
something
new.
that's
not
the
kind
of
changed
circumstance
that
courts
rely
on
to...
to
excuse
an
otherwise
applicable
res
judicata
bar.
the
operative
facts
remain
the
same.
the
1893
agreement
was
there.
the
1894
act
was
there.
all
solicitor
krulitz
did
was
take
the...
the
rejected
legal
theory
that
the
secretary
didn't
adopt
in
1936
and
belatedly
apply
it
to
the
same
facts.
that...
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
if
you
could
keep
avoiding
a
res
judicata
bar
by
changing
your
mind
repeatedly
and
coming
up
with
new
legal
theories
on
the
same
operative
facts,
res
judicata
would
be
a
worthless
doctrine.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the...
the
parties
to
the
settlement,
the
government
and
the
tribe,
of
course
adopted
and
supported,
indeed,
obtained
the
final
solicitor's
opinion
that
reversed
the
three
earlier
solicitor's
opinion
and
held
that
the
tribe
had
title
to
those
lands.
and
in
making
that...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that's
before
the
settlement.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
they
didn't...
they...
i
don't
think
anything
has
changed
on
the
ground.
the
secretarial
order
is
still
applicable.
certain
private
interests
have
been
protected,
and...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
they
haven't...
they
haven't
gone
out
and
developed
it.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
the
title
was
extinguished.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
nothing
has
happened
to
that
land
in
the
disputed
area
since
1983
decision.
the...
the
tribe
and
the
government
prevented
a
decision
on
the
merits
before
judge
brewster
in
the
san
diego
district
court.
then
they
acquiesced
in
our
motion
to
reopen
the
decree,
presumably
preferring
to
have...
hoping
to
have
judge
tuttle
reappointed
as
special
master
as
opposed
to
the...
the
adverse
decisions
they
got
from
judge
brewster
in
san
diego.
but...
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
thank
you,
your
honor.
