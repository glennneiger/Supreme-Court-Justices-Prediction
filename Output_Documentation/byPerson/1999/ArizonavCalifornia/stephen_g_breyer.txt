justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that...
that's
the...
when
you
say
judicial
review...
maybe
you
could
answer
this
later
if
i'm
not
right
on
the
point.
i
think
i
am.
but
my
understanding
of
this
is
that
this
whole
problem
arises
because
we
don't
really
know
who
owns
this
land,
and
there
was
an
opinion
in
the
interior
department
that
said
at
one
point
the
united
states
still
owns
it
and
then
at
another
point
that
the
indian
tribe
owns
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
we
accept
your
arguments
completely.
it's
still
open
under
the
second
decree
to
make
the
argument
and
the
settlement
doesn't
preclude
it.
we
still
haven't
answered
who
owns
the
land,
have
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what's
supposed
to
happen
next?
aren't
we
supposed
to...
i
mean,
we'll
solve
all
these
problems
and
we
can
find
out
who
owns
the
land.
at
one
point
the
district
court
was
going
to
litigate
that,
and
they
reached
an
answer,
and
the
ninth
circuit
set
it
aside
for
some
reason
and
this
court
split
4/4.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
we
can't
send
it
to
the
district
court
or
we
can?
who's
supposed
to
know...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
he's
supposed
to
decide.
if
you're
right,
we
then
send
it
back
to
the
special
master
and
ask
him
now
to
decide
the
question
of
who
owns
the
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
but
you
can't
get
the
water
till
you
decide
who
owns
the
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
so,
it's...
i
just
wanted
to
know
who
is
supposed
to
decide
that
if
you
are
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
answer
is
the
special
master.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct,
correct,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
we
should
do
it
without
sending
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
i
mean,
i
don't
remember
my
a.
james
kausner
property
law
too
well,
but
my...
my
basic
thought
there
was
that
land
is
special
and
you
have
to
go
through
a
lot
of
formalities
to
transfer
title
in
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
settlement
can't
transfer
title
unless...
unless,
you
know,
these
certain
formalities
are...
certainly
wouldn't
cut
off
third
parties.
and
i
guess
if
it
isn't
litigated,
it
wouldn't
even
cut
off
second
parties
from
suing
somebody
else.
now,
is...
is
there
some
special
thing
in...
in
respect
to
the
tribal
land
that
means
those
ordinary
precautions
are
not
applicable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
if
the
indian
claims
commission
act
is
different,
then
under
ordinary
principles,
it
would
not
work.
it's
dependent
on
that
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that...
that
act...
you
know,
they
have
a
whole...
i'm
trying
to
look
at
the
words
of
that,
and
i
thought
the
words
of
that
don't
necessarily
favor
you
too
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it's
shall
be
a
full
discharge
of
the
united
states
of
all
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
i
don't
quite
see
because
why
be
extinguished
as
except
against
the
united
states?
why
would
third
parties
be
involved
and
why,
if
it
weren't
litigated,
second
parties,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
litigated,
absolutely.
if
not
litigated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
of
those
cases,
if
you're
looking
at
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
one...
i
grant
you
the
ninth
circuit
says
this
sort
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that...
that's
their
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
the
cases
themselves,
is
there
any
case
that
doesn't
involve
either
a
litigated
matter
or
findings
that
have
the
equivalent
effect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
assume
you're
right
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume
you're
right
about
that,
but
i
still
want
to
go
in
just
a
little
bit
to
ask
you
about
the
ninth
circuit's
holding...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
has
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
indian
claims
commission,
when
in...
in
a
situation
like
this,
it
extinguishes
claims
of
third
parties?
i
mean,
it's...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
title
passes
as
against
the
world?
i
mean,
that
would
be
enormously
unfair,
wouldn't
it?
you
could
have
two
parties
who
want
to
transfer
land
for
some
reason,
and
then
suddenly
everybody
else
is
cut
off.
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
appear.
they
had
no...
i
mean,
who
knows
what
third
parties
have
claims
against
the
government
or
against
the
tribe?
and
why
should
two
parties
be
able
to
get
together
and
quiet
title
as
against
the
world?
i
don't
see
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that...
that
was
justice
souter's
question.
and
it's
the...
in
my
next
question,
if
you're
going
to
say,
it
does
quiet
title
against
the
world,
i'm
going
to
ask
why.
and
it
seems
enormously
unfair.
if
you're
going
to
make
the
more
limited
claim
that
all
it
does
is
stop
this
party
from
litigating
against
the
world,
that's
quite
different.
but
then
i'm
going
to
say
if
you're
prepared
to
cut
back,
why
not
cut
back
on
that
too
to
ordinary
collateral
estoppel
principles.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
which
is
the
answer?
that
is,
is
it
the
case
that
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
a
settlement,
as
between
the
government
and
the
tribe,
cuts
off
all
claims
as...
that
the
world
might
assert,
quiets
title
as
to
the
world?
what
do
they
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
so,
that
was
the
answer
to
justice
souter's
question.
that's
what
i
was
looking
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
then
that
is
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
no.
yes.
but
the
reason
i
wanted
to
get
the
answer
to
justice
souter
is
that
you
agree
that
ordinary
property
rules
govern
in
respect
to
those
third
parties.
so,
my
question
then
is,
and
why
shouldn't
they
govern
too
in
respect
to
ordinary
rules
of
collateral
estoppel?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't...
