justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
get
one
thing
clear.
the...
judge
mcgarr
apparently
thought
that
one
of
the
issues
that
was
resolved
by
the
settlement
was
the
ownership
of
the
land.
is
that
a
fair
reading
of
his
understanding
of
what
happened?
and
your
position
is
that
really
was
not
an
issue
in
the
litigation
that
was
settled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
litigated,
but
was
it
an
issue
that
conceivably
the
settlement
might
have
been
intended
to
resolve?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
settlement
that
we're
trying
to
puzzle
out
occurred
in
1983
i
think.
and
under
one
version
of
the
settlement,
the...
the
land
thereafter
was
within
the
reservation.
in
another
version
of
the
settlement,
the
land
was
not
within
the
reservation.
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
how
the
parties
treat
it?
where...
did
they
put
up
boundary
signs
anywhere
or
say
you're
in
the
reservation
now
or
not?
or
what...
is
there
any
evidence
to
tell
us
how
the
parties
to
that
settlement
viewed
the
consequences
with
respect
to
the
land?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
before
the
settlement.
and
after
the
settlement,
did
they
continue
to
treat
the
disputed
land
in
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
there
was
no
conduct
post-1983
in
which
the
tribe,
in
effect,
moved
the
boundary
lines
back
to
say,
i
guess,
we've
given
up
title
to
this
land.
nothing
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
theory
is
that
they
did
give
up
that
part
of
the
reservation
in
the
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
