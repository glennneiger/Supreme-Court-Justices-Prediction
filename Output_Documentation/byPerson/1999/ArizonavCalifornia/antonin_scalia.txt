do
you
think
it
really
was
the...
the
intent
of
the
legislation
that
established
the
indian
claims
commission
that
the
united
states
should
acquire
a
judgment
which
lets
the
united
states
off
and
settles
matters
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
but
leaves
all
of
the
settlers
who...
who
are
on
the
reservation
entirely
up
in
the
air
as
to
whether...
you
know,
what
their
rights
are
with
respect
to
the
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
a...
that
a
just...
just
government
would
do
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
are
they
protected
by
the
secretary's
'78
order?
i
didn't...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
said
boundary
land
issues
with
regard
to
reservations,
other
than
this
one.
it
didn't
name
this
one
as
one
of
the
boundary
land
issues,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
cannot
be.
you
do
not
argue
that
there
cannot
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
judgment
itself
didn't
say
which
of
those
two
views
it
was
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
have
gotten
money
either
for
the
taking
or
for
the
fact
that
although
it
hadn't
been
taken,
the
government
had
occupied
it
temporarily
for
some
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
tell
which
of
the
two
they
were
given
the
money
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
that
provision
at
the
end
of
the
opinion?
it
says,
this
judgment
is
not
usable
in
any
other...
in
any
other
litigation.
i
mean,
if
somehow
you
sued
the
settlers,
it
wouldn't
be
useable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
useable
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
square
with
my
understanding
of
that
provision
at
the
end
of
the...
at
the
end
of
the
settlement
agreement,
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
nice.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
it
out
of
that
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
muys,
the
problem
i
have...
i...
i
can
accept
your...
your
proposition
that
the...
that
settlements
under
the
claims
commission
act
are...
are
different
and
that
even
if
the
matter
is
not
litigated,
it...
it
is
binding
on
the
parties,
and
if
they
say
so,
as
they
did
here,
as
against
other
parties
as
well.
but
only
as...
what's
distinctive
about
this
case
is
that
there
were
alternative
claims
for
relief
and
you
don't
know
which
one
of
the
two
they
got
the
money
for.
the
indians
said
either...
either...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
land
was
taken
away
from
us
and
you
owe
us
damage
for
taking
it
away,
or
the
land
wasn't
taken
away
from
us
and
you
owe
us
damages
for
trespassing
on
it.
and
without
deciding
which
of
the
two
is
true,
how
can
we
decide
which
of
those...
which
of
those
two
propositions
to
cram
down
the
throat
of
everybody
else
in
the
future?
they...
they
go
in
different
directions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can't.
they're...
they're
contradictory.
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
also
that
whole...
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
entirely
fair
to
play
it
both
ways
as
against
the
government.
we
don't
know
what
the
money
was
for,
whether
it
was
for
the
trespass
or
for
the
taking.
you
waived
them
both.
so,
as
against
the
united
states,
you
can't
claim
either
one.
fair.
but
when
you
try
to
apply
the
same
principle
against
other
parties,
you
have
to
make
up
your
mind
which
of
the
two
you're
going
to
impose
on
the
other
parties.
are
you
going
to
impose
the
proposition
that
the
indians
own
the
land,
or
are
you
going
to
impose
the
proposition
that
they
don't
own
the
land
because
it's
been
taken
away.
and
with
this
kind
of
a...
of
a
settlement,
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
which
of
the
two
to
impose.
you
have
to
impose
the
one
or
the
other.
which
one
of
the
two
does
this
settlement
require
us
to
impose
on
third
parties?
you
can't
say
both
because
they
lead
to
inconsistent
results.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
they
do.
if
the
indians
own
the
land,
they're
entitled
to
the
water.
if
they
don't
own
the
land,
they're
not
entitled
to
the
water.
now,
which...
which...
do
i
impose
that
portion
of
the
settlement
that
may
have
been
given
them...
to
them
for
the
taking
or
that
portion
that
was
given
to
them
for
the
trespass?
i
have
no
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that...
be
willing
to
accept
that
if...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
were
only
a
takings
claim,
but
it
wasn't
only
a...
it
was
an
alternative
claim
for
either
a
taking
or...
or
a
trespass.
and...
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
doesn't
speak
to
that.
i
honestly
don't
know
which
of
the
two
effects
of
the
judgement
to
impose
upon
somebody
else.
they're...
they're
inconsistent...
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
were
alternative
theories.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
before
the
settlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
only
said
boundary
lands
with
respect
to
two
other
reservations.
it
didn't
specifically
say
boundary
lands
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
the
judgment
doesn't
say
it,
it's
also
that
one
of
the
claims
that
they
made
was...
was
the
claim
that
was
just
inconsistent
with
the...
with
the
fact
that
they
accepted
the
solicitor's
new
opinion.
