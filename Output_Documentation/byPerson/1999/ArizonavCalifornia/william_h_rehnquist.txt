chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
8,
original,
the
state
of
arizona
v.
the
state
of
california.
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
is
still
in
session.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
minear,
now
the
government
takes
the
position
here
with
respect
to
the
preclusion
claim
which
the
master
rejected;
that
is,
the
change
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
government
when
the
interior
solicitor
changed
his
mind.
there
the
government
says
that
that
claim,
the
preclusion
claim,
was
waived.
i
take
it
with
respect
to
the
court
of
claims
judgment
preclusion
argument
you
don't
take
the
position
that
that's
waived?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
secretary
certainly
changed
his
mind
about
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
if...
what
if
the...
what
if
we
were
to
accept
the
state's
submission
that
the
special
master's
ruling
on
that
aspect
of
res
judicata
was
wrong
and
that
the
fact
that
the
government
changed
its
mind
is
not
a
basis
for
going
back
into
the
case
again?
how
would
that
affect
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
articles...
the
rest
of
its
arguments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the...
the...
it
was
argued
to
the
special
master
that
the
secretary's
changing
his
mind,
not
just
the
solicitor's
changing
his
mind,
was
something
that
avoided
the
effect
of
res
judicata.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
as
i
read
these...
the
master's
report,
it
said
that
the...
it
was
an
unforeseen
circumstance
that
the
margold
opinion
would
be
reversed
by
a...
a
later
solicitor
and
that,
therefore,
res
judicata
didn't
apply.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
now,
what
if...
what
if
we
think
the
master
was
wrong
in
rejecting
the
state's
argument
for
that
reason?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
reason
then
for
arguing
preclusion
on
this
basis
before
the
master
if
it
didn't
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can...
can
a
court
limit
the
preclusive
effect
of
its
judgment,
i
mean,
by
simply
saying
this
shall
not
have
preclusive
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
morisset.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is...
this
is...
where
were
you
reading
from,
mr.
morisset?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
the
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
muys,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're...
you're
not
arguing
here
that
the
world
is...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
simply
saying
that
the
tribe
is
bound
because
it
was
a
party
to
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
third
party...
no
third
party
relying...
going
against
the
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
muys?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
cover
the
state's
other
res
judicata
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
are
ourselves...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
trial
court
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
the
master
treated
it
on
the
merits,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
muys.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank...
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.

justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
