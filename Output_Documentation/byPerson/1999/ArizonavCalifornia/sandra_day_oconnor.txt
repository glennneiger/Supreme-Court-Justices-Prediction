mr.
minear,
where
do
we
find
the
best
map
showing
the
boundaries
of
the
land
in
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
big
one
is
just...
it's
too
small
to
see.
the...
the
one
at
page
24a,
exhibit
e?
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
the...
is
it
blue
boundary
that...
in
that
map
that
shows
the
land
in
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
couldn't
find
anything
that
really
showed
me
what
we
were
dealing
with.
but
you
think
it's
basically
the
land
encompassed
in
blue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but...
and
the
total
is
some
25,000
acres?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
all
of
that
land
practicably
irrigable
as
the...
the
cases
deal
with
that
term,
all
25,000
acres,
or
some
smaller
portion
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
don't
know
how
much
because
it
hasn't
been
determined?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
preliminary
studies
show
how...
how
much
in
acre-feet
of
water
year
are
we
talking
about,
probably?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
would
that
impact
on
existing
distribution
and
users?
is
that
a
significant
figure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
might
change
their
mind
in
the
future.
yes.
you
say
they
won't
arise
because
the
tribe
now
agrees,
but
they
might
change
their
mind.
they
changed
their
mind
about
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
actually
this
court
should
decide
it
upon
the...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
recommendation
of
the
master
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
was
a
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
pend
orielle
case
that
seemed
to
apply
issue
preclusive
effect
to
the
indian
claims
commission
judgment
in
a
suit
between
the
tribe
in
that
case
and
third
parties.
so,
at
least
the
ninth
circuit
has
found
issue
preclusion
on
circumstances
like
the
ones
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
say
if...
if
the
claims
commission
procedure
had
really
dealt
specifically
and
expressly
with
the
issues,
then
fine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
preclusion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
that
didn't
happen
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
relying
on
the
pend
orielle
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there,
there
was
specific...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
litigation
of
the
issue
and
findings,
and
we
don't
have
it
here.
and
it's...
i'm
not
sure
you
have
to
read
that
into
section
22
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought...
i
thought
they
brought
a
claim
for
more
than
a
taking,
that
they
have...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
alternative
theories.
and
the
thing
that's
striking
about
this
procedure
is
that
now
you
have
the
two
parties
to
the
settlement
agreement,
the
united
states
and
the
tribe,
coming
in
and
telling
us
the
same
story,
which
is
it
isn't
what
you
say
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
they're
telling
us
now.
it
didn't
tell
us
in
the
judgment,
and
they're
telling
us
now.
do
we
disregard
that?
