well,
i...
i
suppose
the
usual
rule
is
that
when
lands
are...
are
taken
and
there...
there
is...
is
a
finding
in
favor
of
the
previous
owner,
the
government
ends
up
owning
those
lands.
but
is
that
true
in
all
cases
if
the
damages
are
marked
just
for
trespass?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so,
all
settlements
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act
must
be
treated
as
adjudications?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
whole
analysis
assumes
that
the
tribe
is
100
percent
correct
in...
in
its...
in
its
legal
position...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
any
discount
for
the
fact
that
it
may
be
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
so-called
omitted
lands...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
were...
were
not
within
the
disputed
boundary
areas,
were
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
i...
i
had
thought
that
the
decrees
of
the
court
in
arizona
i
and
ii
indicated
that
it
was
not
conclusive
as
to
the
boundary
lands.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
the
court's
treatment
of
omitted
lands
and
boundary
lands
for
preclusive
purposes
is
quite
different.
