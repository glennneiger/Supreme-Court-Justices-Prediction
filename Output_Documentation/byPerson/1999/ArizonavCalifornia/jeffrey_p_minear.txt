mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
another
chapter
in
the
arizona
v.
california
water
rights
adjudication.
the
case
involves
the
so-called
boundary
land
claims
that
were
left
undecided
in
arizona
i
and
arizona
ii.
the
united
states
takes
exception
to
the
master's
recommendation
that
a
1983
claims
court
consent
judgment
between
the
united
states
and
the
quechan
tribe
precludes
litigation
of
their
water
rights
claim
concerning
the
quechan
boundary
lands.
the
master
concluded
that
the
settlement
extinguished
the
tribe's
right
to
those
lands
and,
therefore,
eliminated
the
basis
for
claiming
water
rights
in
this
adjudication.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the...
the
best
map
would
be
that
that
is
appended
to
the
tribe's
brief,
the
red-colored
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
are
two
maps
here.
one
is
the
general
locator
map
which
shows
the...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
was
looking
at
locator
map
number
2
that's
also
included
here,
yes,
the
one
that
you're
showing
me
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that's
so,
although
it's
actually
more
complicated
than
that
because
due
to
a
number...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
with...
with
the
understanding
that
there
are
a
number
of
allotments
and
other
lands
that
are
excepted
from
that
area.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
actual
lands...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
the
total...
the
maximum
claim
would
be
25,000
acres.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
a
smaller
portion
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
there
were
preliminary
determinations
that
were
made
by
special
master
tuttle
in
the
report
that
was
reviewed
in
arizona
ii.
however,
the
court
did
not
reach
these
issues
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
practicable
irrigable
acreage
because
of
the
way
it
disposed
of
that
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
could
be
as
much
as
70,000
acre-feet.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
a
relatively
small
amount,
but
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
a
part
of
the
country
where
all
water
is
quite
precious.
the
total
amount
of
water
that's
divided
by
the...
the
boulder
canyon
act
is
7
and
a
half
million
acre-feet.
so,
70,000
acres
is...
is
significant,
but
a
relatively
small
portion
of
the
total
amount.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
point
i
was
making
before
with
regard
to
the
master's
determination
in
this
case.
he
concluded,
as
i
said,
the
tribe's
lands
were
extinguished
by
the
claims
court
consent
judgment
and,
therefore,
there
was
no
basis
for
claiming
water
rights
in
this
case.
and
we...
we
respectfully
submit
the
master
erred
because
he
misunderstood
the
judgment
and
the
scope
of
its
preclusive
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
hasn't
been
our...
been
our
argument,
no.
our
argument
has
been
simply
the
judgment
does
not
have
issue-preclusive
effect.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
for
a
judgment
to
have
preclusive
effect,
the
issue
underlying
it
must
be
actually
litigated
and
determined,
and
that
determination
must
be
essential
to
the
judgment
that
is
entered.
and
that
simply
is
not
the
case
in
this
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
the...
the
state
parties
are
referring
to
the
provisions
for
claim
preclusion
that
exist
in
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
and
our
understanding
of
that
act
is
as
follows.
that
act
dealt
with
the
creation
of
a
special
commission,
a
article
i
court,
to
resolve
indian
claims.
and
in
the
course
of
enacting
the
statute,
congress
made
quite
clear
what
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
administrative
body's
claims
would
be.
and
that's,
of
course,
an
appropriate
thing
for
congress
to
do
because,
as
this
court
indicated
in
university
of
tennessee
v.
elliott,
it's
for
congress
to
determine
what
preclusive
effect
a...
an
administrative
body
might
have.
and
our
view
is
that
the
statutory
preclusion
that's
provided
is
simply
the
equivalent
of
the
merger
in
bar
rules
that
would...
would
apply
to
a
judicial
decision.
now,
that
deals
with
the
question
of
claim
preclusion
not
issue
preclusion.
and
what
we
have
here
with
regard
to
the
consent
judgment
is
a
question
of...
the
more
narrow
question
of
issue
preclusion.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
judgment
by
the
claims
court
precluded
any
further
assertions
by
the
tribe
against
the
united
states
with
respect
to
these
lands.
the
question
that's
presented
here
is
whether
it
made
a
determination
with
regard
to
the
status
of
the
boundary
lands.
and
we
believe
it
did
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
first,
with
regard
to
this
claim,
none
of
those...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
none
of
those
issues...
in
this
case
those
issues
will
not
arise,
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
judgment
itself
was
predicated
on
the
secretary's
1978
order
which
dealt
with
those
specific
issues.
and
so,
we
do
believe
that
it
would
have
claim-preclusive
effect
in
the
sense
that
it
was
predicated
on
that
judgment.
but
those
issues
are
simply
not
before
the
court
here.
there
is...
there
hasn't
been
any
dispute
with
regard
to
any
of
the
settlers
whose
rights
were
protected
by
the
secretary's
order
himself.
the
question
here
instead
is
a
quite
different
one.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the...
the
secretary's
'78
order,
followed
by
the
secretary's
1981
order,
identified
the
particular
tracts
of
land
that
are
owned
by
private
persons
that
the
tribe
has
no
claim
to,
and
the
tribe
has...
has
indicated
that
it
agrees
with
that...
that
outcome.
so,
those
issues
simply
won't
arise
here.
the
only
question
is...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
don't
believe
they
changed
their
mind
about
this,
that
the
tribe's
positions...
they've
put
forward
alternative
positions,
but
they
have
been
consistent.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
secretary
did
change
his
mind,
but
the
position
since
1978
has
been
consistent.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
that
our
position
here
is
that
the...
the
secretary
was
entitled...
this
matter
had
not
been
determined
and
had
been
preserved
by
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
i
in
its
decree
in
1979.
the
court...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
as...
i
believe
that
the...
what
had
happened
here...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
was...
that
was
the
ruling
that
the
master
gave
in
rejecting
the
state's
argument
with
regard
to
res
judicata.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the
master's
decision,
his
judgment,
should
still
be
affirmed
for
a
quite
different
reason,
and
that
is
that
this
court
in
arizona
i
made
clear
that
the
boundary
land
issues
would
simply
not
be
reached
in
this
litigation
in
arizona
i.
and
it
made
that
clear
in
its
1964
decree,
and
it
extended
it
to
this...
to
this
reservation
in
its
1979
decree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
think
that
the...
the
master
simply
misunderstood
the
law
and
the
prior
proceedings
here.
we
think
there
are
two
issues
here
and
let
me
try
and
walk
through
each
of
them.
one
is
the...
the
claim
preclusion
argument
the
state
is
making
in...
in
an
exception
to
the
master's
ruling
which
held
that
there
was
no
claim
preclusive
effect
from
this
court's
past
decisions.
this
court
in
arizona
i
said
that
we're
not
going
to
decide
the
boundary
land
issues.
in
arizona
ii,
the
issue
arose
again.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
1963,
they
addressed
two
boundary
land
issues...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
fort
mojave...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation.
in
1979,
it
became
clear,
after
the
secretary's
decision
here,
that
there
were
three
other
reservations
that
had
these
issues.
the
court
in
response,
in
1979,
entered
a...
modified
its
decree
to
make
clear
that
all
five
reservations
would
now
be...
their
boundary
lands
would
be
open.
and
let
me
read
the
language
to
you
from
the
'79
decree.
the
quantity
fixed
in
paragraph
1
through
5
of
article
ii(d)
of
said
decree...
which
deals
with
the
indian
reservations,
all
five
of
them...
shall
continue
to
be
subject
to
appropriate
adjustment
by
agreement
or
decree
of
this
court
in
the
event
that
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
reservations
are
finally
determined.
special
master
tuttle,
when
he
saw
this
provision,
said,
well,
all
of
these
issues
are
open,
but
he
said,
ultimately
i'm
going
to
accept
the
secretary's
decision
as
a
final,
conclusive
determination
of
those
water
rights...
and...
of
those
boundary
lands
and
the
accompanying
water
rights.
this
court
in
arizona
ii
said,
no,
there
has
to
be
judicial
review
of
the
secretary's
decision.
and
that's
what
the
united
states
has
sought
since
that
time
with
regard
to
the
quechan
tribe,
and
that's
all
we're
asking
for
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
basically
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
right
now
at
the...
after
the...
the
california
case,
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
this
court
appointed
special
master
mcgarr
to
decide
these
issues
and
we
thought
to
decide
them
on
the
merits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
or
in
the
alternative...
the
ultimate
reason
why
we're
trying
to
determine
the
land
here
is
to
determine
the
amount
of
water
that
ought
to
be
dealt...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
special
master
should
decide
it.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
recommendation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
to...
to
be
specific,
obviously
this
court
acts
with
the
assistance
of
the
special
master.
but
our...
our
concern
here
is
that
this
claim
has
not
been
determined
on
the
merits.
and
it...
it
deserves
its
day
in
court.
and
so,
we
think
that
the
master
simply
pretermitted
this
issue
without...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
distinction
here.
we
don't
argue
that
there
can
be
issue
preclusion
from
an
issue
that
is
actually
litigated
and
determined
by
the...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
cannot
be.
excuse
me.
there
cannot
be
issue
preclusion
where
the
issue
is
actually
litigated
and
determined.
in
the
pend
orielle
case...
i'd
like
you
to
take
a
look
to
that...
at
that
case
because
it's
quite
clear
there
that
the...
looking
at
the
opinion
on
page
926
f.
2d
1508,
the
opinion
indicates
that
the
status
of
the
lands
at
issue
there
had
plainly
been
adjudicated
by
the
commission.
the
same
is
true
with
the
other
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
state.
in
gemmill,
the
icc
made
a
finding
that
the
land
had
been
taken.
the
settlement
that
was
dealt
with
there
dealt
with
the
question
of
damages,
not
the
question
of
liability.
there's
been
no
liability...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
and
i
think
you
can
tell
that
from
the...
the
judgment
that
is...
that
is
reproduced
in
our
brief
at
pages
66a
and
67a.
the
judgment
simply
states,
a
judgment
is
rendered
for
plaintiff...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
66a
of
the
gray
brief,
our
exceptions
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
judgment
is
rendered
for
plaintiff
in
the
amount
of
$
15
million.
it
doesn't
explain
the
theory
for
that
award.
it
simply
is
a
settlement
of
the
suit.
moreover,
on
page
67a,
the
parties
made
clear
they
do
not
expect
it
to
have
preclusive
effect.
the
final
judgment
is
based
on
a
compromise
and
settlement
and
shall
not
be
construed
as
an
admission
by
either
party
for
the
purposes
of
precedent
or
argument
in
any
other
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
that
a
court
can...
has
that
power.
it
can
determine
what
the
scope
of
its
judgment
is.
what
i
think
is
important
here
is
that
there
never
was
any
actual
litigation
over
the
issue,
and
that's
essential.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
certainly
was
not
actually
litigated
and
determined.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
there
are
two...
two
different
approaches,
yes.
the
issue...
ultimately
the
litigation
was
aimed
at
that,
and
the
tribe
had
two
different
views.
one
was
that
either
we
had
taken
the
land.
the
other
view
was
we...
the
tribe
still
owned
the
land,
but
they're
entitled
to
temporary
damages.
and
the
tribe
and
united
states
agreed
in
that
latter
view
of
what
this
case
was
about.
now,
that...
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
judgment
to
determine
that,
and
we
don't
think
you
really
need
to
do
that.
we
think
it's
enough
here
simply
to
realize
that
the
court
itself
did
not
adjudicate...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
from
the
judgment...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
cannot
from
the
judgment.
we
believe
if
you
look
behind
the
judgment,
it
would
support
our
view
that
in
fact
it
was
for
a
temporary
occupation,
but
we
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
i
think...
actually,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
claim
was...
existed
in
the
initial
petition.
there
was
a
claim
that
the
agreement
that...
that
removed
the
land
was
entirely
nugatory.
the
tribe
vacillated
back
and
forth
between
the
various
theories.
there
was
a
later
amendment,
but
we
think
that
amendment
went
more
to
a
taking
rather
than
to
the
idea
that
the
agreement
was
invalid
and
the
tribes,
therefore,
still
owned
the
land.
i
would
like
to
reserve...
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
first
just
simply
make
the
point
with
regard
to
the
state's
exception
that
our...
our
position
here
is...
is
rather
simple.
arizona
i
made
clear
that
boundary
land
issues
would
not
be
determined
in
that
litigation.
so,
we
could
not
have
raised
the
quechan
boundary
land
issue
at
that
time.
it
simply
wasn't
available.
in
1979,
the
court
made
that
clear.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
implicitly...
i
think
that
you
could
read
that
implicitly
into
the...
into
what
the
court
determined.
that's
how
master
tuttle
read
it.
but
what's
explicit
is
the
court's
1979
decree
where
it
makes
clear
that
all
five...
all
five
reservation
boundaries
remain
open.
and
i
think
that
discloses
the...
the
claimed
preclusion
effect
of
this
court's
past
decisions.
with
regard
to
the
issue-preclusive
effect
of
the
consent
judgment.
i'd
like
to
make
several
points
on
that.
first
of
all,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
change
in
position
of
the
united
states,
since
1978,
we
have
consistently
taken
a
position
with
regard
to
these
lands.
it's
articulated
in
the
1978
and
1981
decisions
of
the
secretary,
and
we
have
continued
to
rely
on
those
decisions.
we
have
not
suggested
in
any
way
that
the
boundaries
that
are
laid
out
quite
specifically
in
those
orders
have
been
renounced
in
any
way.
and
in
fact,
our
assertion
of
the
water
right
throughout
this
whole
period
indicates
that
we
believe
the
consequences
of
the
judgment
of
the
claims
court
was
simply
to
preclude
the
claims
against
the
tribe...
by
the
tribe
against
the
united
states.
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
agreed
on
who
owned
the
land.
that's
what
led
to
the
settlement.
there
is
simply
no
longer
a
controversy
after
the
1978
decision
that
these
lands
were
held
by
the
tribe
and
that
we
were
paying
trespass
damages.
the
judgment
doesn't
say
that,
but
if
you
look
behind
it,
that's
what
you're
going
to
find.
in
that...
given
that
situation,
we
think
the
fair
thing
to
do
is
to
litigate
this
question
of
the
validity
of
the
secretary's
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
absolutely
right,
and
i
think
that
the
point
that
you
made
is
well
taken
that
there's
a
contradiction
here.
