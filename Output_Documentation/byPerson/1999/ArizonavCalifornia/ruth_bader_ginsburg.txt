mr.
minear,
i
think
that
the
states
are
saying
there's
some
kind
of
special
preclusion
rule
that
they
call
a
statutory
preclusion.
they
concede
that
the
ordinary
rule
is
the
consent
judgment
doesn't
decide
any
issues.
they
say...
they
use
a
term
i
hadn't
heard
before,
statutory
preclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that
was
put
in...
that
second
theory...
by
an
amendment
later
on.
right?
originally
it
was
like
the
other
cases.
it
was
a
taking
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
morisset,
would
you
explain
that
to
me
in
relation
to
the
famous
1978
decision?
because
what's
called
the
krulitz
opinion
consistently
refers
to
this
disputed
land
as
non-irrigable
acreage.
so,
if...
if
it's
non-irrigable
acreage,
then
they'll...
even
if
the
tribe
title
loses...
or
the
united
states
as
trustee's
title
is...
is
settled,
if
there's
no
irrigable
acreage,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
also
included
the
tribe's
claim
that
it
was
their
land
all
along
and
the
damages
were
for
trespass
on
land
to
which
they
held
or
the
government
as
trustee
held
title.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
settled
that
claim
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
know
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
say...
well...
the
claim
for
trespass,
they
got
$
15
million
for
trespass
damages
for
all
the
years
that
the
united
states
has
trespassed.
the...
in
the...
in
the
number
of
cases
that
you
cited...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
special
preclusion
effect
of
these
settlements,
as
far
as
i
know,
none
of
them
put
forth
this
alternative.
the
others
all
said
the
government
took
our
land,
we
want
to
be
compensated,
and
then
there
was
a
determination.
but
here,
it
seems
to
me
it's
like
when
a
case
goes
to
the
jury
on
alternate
theories,
they
come
back
with
a
general
verdict.
then
you
don't
know
which
one
they
relied
on.
there's
no
preclusive
effect
from
that
general
verdict,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
kind
of
ironic
for
you
to
be
making
that
claim
when
you
woke
up
later,
and
you
do
acknowledge
that...
that
any
preclusion
claim
is
ordinarily
an
affirmative
defense,
and
if
you
don't
raise
it
on
time...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
first
opportunity
to
do
so,
you
lose
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
whole
principle
of
preclusion,
as
i
understand
it,
is
it
ordinarily
follows
a
party
presentation.
it's
a
defense
for
you
to
raise
or
not
raise.
sometimes
parties
don't
want
to
raise
it.
they
want
to
get
a
litigated
decision.
and
yes,
a
court
can
but
ordinarily
a
court
won't.
the
court
will
say
you
could
have
raised
it,
you
didn't,
i'm
not
going
to
raise
it
for
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
original
action,
now
nearly
a
half-century
old,
concerns
rights
to
water
from
the
colorado
river
system.
we
have
already
issued
two
opinions
in
this
case;
one
in
1963
and
the
second
in
1983.
in
this
third
installment
of
the
litigation,
the
quechan
tribe
and
the
united
states
on
the
tribe’s
behalf,
claimed
rights
to
additional
water
for
the
quechan
tribes
reservation.
the
states
of
arizona
and
california
together
with
two
municipal
water
districts
urged
an
opposition
that
these
additional
water
rights
claims
are
made
too
late.
specifically,
they
urged
that
the
further
adjudication
sought
by
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
is
foreclosed
either
by
this
court’s
1963
decision
in
this
case
or
by
a
consent
judgment
entered
in
1983
by
the
united
states
claims
court
in
an
action
brought
by
the
tribe
against
united
states.
the
special
master
recommended
that
we
reject
the
first
ground
for
refusing
to
consider
the
tribe’s
eligibility
for
additional
river
water,
but
accept
the
second.
we
reject
both
grounds
for
precluding
further
proceedings.
first,
we
need
not
decide
whether
our
1963
decision
would
bar
the
present
claims,
but
we
hold
that
the
state
parties
have
forfeited
their
preclusion
defense
by
failing
to
raise
it
earlier
in
the
litigation
despite
ample
opportunity
and
cause
to
do
so.
we
next
consider
and
reject
the
special
master’s
conclusion
that
the
1983
claims
court
consent
judgment,
extinguished
the
tribe’s
claim
to
title
in
the
disputed
lands.
as
between
the
tribe
and
the
united
states,
the
consent
judgment
did
indeed
preclude
litigation
of
all
claims
and
defenses
that
had
been
or
could
have
been
brought.
but
consent
judgments
do
not
involve
the
actual
litigation
and
judicial
determination
of
specific
issues.
therefore
consent
judgments
ordinarily
do
not
preclude
the
litigation
of
such
issues
in
discreet
actions
against
third
parties.
that
is
particularly
true,
where
as
in
this
case,
the
consent
judgment
is
ambiguous
as
between
mutually
exclusive
theories
of
recovery.
finally,
we
accept
the
master’s
recommendation
concerning
water
rights
claims
for
two
other
indian
reservations
and
approve
the
party’s
proposed
settlements
with
respect
to
those
reservations.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
joined
by
justice
o’connor
and
justice
thomas.
