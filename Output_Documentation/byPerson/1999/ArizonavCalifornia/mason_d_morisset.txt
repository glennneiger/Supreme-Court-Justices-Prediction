mr.
mason
d.
morisset
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
justice
scalia's
point
about
the
settlers
and
the
farmers.
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear,
as
i
think
is
pointed
out
in
the
letter
of
counsel
to
the
tribe
in
'83,
which
is
reproduced
in
our
red
brief
at
page
9a,
that
the
tribe
was
well
aware
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
that
it
was
being
paid
for
the
lands
which
had
passed
into
ownership
with
settlers,
as
you
say,
or...
or
farmers,
ranchers,
and
other
interests
at
the
time
of
the
agreement.
on
page
10a,
counsel
says,
after
telling
the
tribe
that
they
have
persuasive
evidence
about
damages,
quote,
at
the
very
top
of
the
page,
the
loss
of
the
so-called
bard
lands,
the
lands
that
were
taken
for
levies,
the
lands
taken
for
the
all-american
canal,
and
the
sand
and
gravel
removed
from
the
reservation,
period,
unquote.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
this
is...
this
is
page
10a
of
our
red
brief.
it's
appendix
b.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
the
very
top
of
the
page,
top
of
page
10a.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
now,
if
the
question
to
me
is...
and
i
think
this
is
implied...
does
the
tribe
have
a
claim
against
settlers,
the
answer
is
no.
can
the
tribe
in
any
way
move
to
get
that
land
back?
no.
the
tribe
has
been
paid
for
that.
the
secretary
made
it
very
clear
in
his
order,
as
the
solicitor
general
has...
has
so
well
put,
that
all
perfected
rights
are
protected
and
those
do
not
somehow
go
back
to
the
tribe.
the
tribe
doesn't
have
any
claim
on
them.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
if...
i
think
it
would
be
useable
in
the
sense
that
you
need
to
look
beyond...
behind
the
agreement
to
see
what
happened
at
the
time
and
whether
or
not
the
tribe
has
any
claim
left
on
those
kinds
of
claims.
the
answer
is
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
don't
think
it's
useable
by
the
tribe.
it
might
be
useable
by
someone
else
in
defense.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well...
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
think
it...
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
language
and
the
underlying
facts
that
at
the
time
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
were
in
complete
agreement
on
who
owned
the
land,
and
the
answer
was
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
and
they
did
not,
in
any
way,
attempt
to
get
compensation
for
that
kind
of
claim
per
se.
they
did...
were
willing
to
give
up
their
claim
against
the
united
states
as
part
of
the
deal,
and
their
claim
against
the
united
states
is
now
foreclosed
by
the
judgment.
it's
an
entirely
different
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
still
land
within
the
reservation.
as
has
been
pointed
out,
who's
going
to
decide
this?
because
if...
if
we
drop
the
case
at
this
point,
it's
never
going
to
be
clear
who
owns
the
land
unless
we
insist,
as
the
tribe
would
insist,
that
the
solicitor
is
correct
and
it's
still
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
we
think
that
this...
this
boundary
question
needs
to
be
decided
by
this
court
after
remand
for
a
fact
finding
by...
by
a...
a
special
master
so
we
can
put
this
at
rest.
we
are
talking
about
a
drop
in
the
bucket
of
the
overall
water,
1...
less
than
1
percent
of
the
water,
but
a
huge
bucket
for
the
tribe.
this
is
a
desert
tribe.
they
need
that
water
for...
for
agriculture.
we're
talking
somewhere
between
6,000
to
10,000
acres
that
might
be
irrigable
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
the
master
went
through
that
in
great
detail:
peanuts
versus
cauliflower
versus
lettuce
but...
so,
it's
not
quite
clear
how
much
land
there
would
be,
but
somewhere
along
those
lines.
the
rest...
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
the...
special
master
tuttle
found...
and
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
overturned
on
a...
a
new
remand
to
a
new
special
master...
that
in
fact
there
were...
there
was
some
irrigable
acreage
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
technical
discussion
about
what
that
meant,
having
to
do
with
soil
types,
whether
you
could
get
water
there,
whether
you
could
grow
crops
or
not.
i
think
the...
the
solicitor
of
the
department
in
'78
was
speaking
generally
because
generally
we
are
talking
about,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
the
land
that's
in
this
upper
northwest
corner,
which
is
a
mesa
territory,
and
much
of
that
is
non-irrigable.
but
i
think
now
in
the
cession,
there
is...
and
again,
it's
still
contentious
exactly
how
much...
somewhere
between
6,000
to
8,000
to
10,000
acres
that
could
be
irrigated
under
modern
techniques.
i'd
like
to
yield
the
rest
of
my
time
to
the
solicitor
general
for
reply
if
necessary,
mr.
chief
justice.
