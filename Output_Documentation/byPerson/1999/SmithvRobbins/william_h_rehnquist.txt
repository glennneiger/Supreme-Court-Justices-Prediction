h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
smith
v.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
jorstad,
doesn't
the
strength
of
your
second
argument
on
the
prejudice
and
so
forth
from
strickland
depend
to
a
certain
extent
on
whether
we
agree
with
you
that
the
constitutional
rights
for
the
appellants
discussed
in
anders
do
not
require
that
the
particular
anders
remedy
be
etched
in
stone,
that
other
remedies
would
be
equally
effective?
isn't
that
going
to
influence
somewhat
the
outcome
of
the
strickland
analysis
in
the
second
prong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
court
is
free
to
interpret
its
own
opinions
to
decide
that
perhaps
a
suggestion
in
the
opinion,
or
a
formula,
was
not
mandatory
but
could
be
replaced
by
an
equally
acceptable
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
rules,
ms.
jorstad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
that
ever
actually
happened
in
california?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
jorstad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nessim,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
nessim,
supposing
that
under
a
state
which
follows
the
anders
rules,
an
anders
brief
is
filed,
but...
and
the
state...
the
federal
court
finds
that
there
was
some
issue
that
should
have
been
raised,
what
does
the
federal
court...
can
the
federal
court
examine
that
on
habeas,
and
if
it
does
find
an
issue
should
have
been
raised,
what
is
the
remedy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
talk
about
consuming
time,
though.
i
mean,
here
the
lawyer
in
the
state
court
on
appeal
filed
a
no-merits
brief
under
anders,
and
you
say
the
federal
district
court,
it
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
there
actually
was
any
error
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
but
only
that
there
was
an
arguable
issue,
and
then
what,
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court
to
have
another
argument
on
an
arguable
issue,
without
ever
finding
any
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
trial.
that
does
seem
going
around
robin
hood's
barn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
going
to
be
the
reaction
of
a
typical
court
when
it
gets
the
kind
of
brief
you
say
ought
to
be
filed?
there
are
six
issues
here,
but
they're
all
frivolous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
answer
my
question,
if
you
will...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
just
go
into
some
recitation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
issues
are
arguable,
he
has
to
file
a
merits
brief,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
sure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
means
that
he
thinks
they're
frivolous,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
in
wende
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
approved
this
system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
here
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
they
were
satisfied
the
respondent's
attorney
had
fully
complied
with
the
responsibilities
in
wende.
i
mean,
that
suggests
that
the
california
courts
do
recognize
this
system.
i
mean,
it
would
really
be
a
very
strange
world
if
the
california
courts
don't
recognize
it,
and
yet
this
case
comes
here
in
this
posture.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
a
question
for
us,
whether
california
courts
misinterpret
their
own
law.
that's
up
to
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
before
you
go
back
to
any
other
question,
i
wish
you'd
answer
mine,
and
here
the
california
court
of
appeals
said
it
examined
the
record,
found
no
other
arguable
issues,
and
the
response
attorney
fully
complied
with
his
responsibilities,
citing
wende,
and
then
the
california
supreme
court
denies
review.
are
you
saying
that
this
is
the
california
court
of
appeals'
position
is
contrary
to
california
precedent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
we've
got
the
california
court
of
appeals
saying
this
did
comply
with
wende.
we've
got
you
saying
it
didn't.
that's
a
rather
easy
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nessim.
ms.
jorstad,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
jorstad.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
no.
98-1037,
smith
versus
robbins
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
