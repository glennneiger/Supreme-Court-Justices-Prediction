i
thought
we...
we
don't
mandate
anything.
we're
not
like
a
legislature.
we
don't
issue
prescriptions.
i
suppose
the
only
real
holding
in
anders,
the
only
holding
in
the
actual
case
was
that
what
occurred
there
did
not
comply
with
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
further
statement
that
in
order
to
comply
with
the
constitution
you
have
to
do
this,
this,
this,
and
this
can
be
regarded
as
dictum,
which
you
would
be
well-advised,
if
you're
a
lower
court,
to
follow,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
a
legislature
has
the
obligation
to
follow
that
prescription
as
though
we
were
laying
down
a
prescription.
we
decided
in
anders
that
what
occurred
there
did
not
provide
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
strange,
i
suppose
there
are
innumerable
frivolous
issues
that
could
be
found
in
any
case.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
failure
of
california
to
provide
a
thirteenth
juror
is
a
frivolous
issue.
how
does
counsel
go...
well,
yes,
he
has
to
identify
issues
that
he
thinks
do
not
justify
an
appeal,
correct,
but
if
they
justify
an
appeal,
that
is,
i
guess
if
they're
arguable,
he
has
to
conduct
the
appeal,
so
what
he
has
to
list
are
frivolous
issues.
there
are
innumerable
frivolous
issues
in
any
case.
i
really
don't...
i
don't
know
what
i
would
do
with
this
if
i
had
to
comply
with
it.
