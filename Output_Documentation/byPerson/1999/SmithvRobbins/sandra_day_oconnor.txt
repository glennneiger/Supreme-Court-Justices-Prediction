justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
guess...
why
don't
you
help
us
understand
what
the
california
procedure
is.
a
lawyer
there
representing
an
indigent
defendant
can
find...
can
conclude
that
he
finds
no
valid
grounds
for
overturning
the
appeal,
and
just
write
something
to
the
court
saying
that,
but
not
asking
to
withdraw,
and
not
pointing
out
any
arguable
issues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
i
mean,
that's
acceptable.
that's
what
happened
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
what
happened
here
was
that
the
lawyer
found
no
grounds
that
he
thought
justified
going
further,
and
so
advised
the
california
courts,
and
did
not
ask
to
withdraw,
and
did
not
point
out
any
so-called
arguable
issues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
here
the
federal
courts
apparently
concluded
that
there
were
some
issues
that
ought
to
be
raised
and
litigated.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
jorstad,
wouldn't
it
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
an
explanation
of
arguable
issues
and
why
they
were
rejected?
i
mean,
if
i
were
assigned
the
task
of
going
over
these
records,
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
good
starting
point
for
me.
i'm
just
surprised
that
california
is
resisting
having
such
a
system.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
this
record
have
any
statistics
or
figures
on
how
often
these
no...
these
wende
briefs
are
filed
in
california,
percentage
wise?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
the
statistics
also
tell
us
how
often
under
a
wende
procedure
the
courts
would
actually
find
arguable
issues
on
their
review
and
send
it
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
let's
get
down
to
what
you
really
are
complaining
about
so
that
i
can
get
this
in
perspective.
what
you
say
should
have
happened
here
is
that
the
lawyer,
who
found
no
good
issue,
should
nonetheless
have
spelled
out
what
arguable
issues
there
might
be,
even
though
he
didn't
think
they
were
sustainable
for
a
legitimate
on
appeal,
right?
you
want
to
see
that,
you
want
to
see
this
spelled
out.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
also
you
want,
as
i
understand
it,
to
require
that
the
lawyer,
having
filed
that,
then
withdraw.
is
that
the
other
component
of
what
you
want?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
that's
what
we're
quibbling
about,
some
description
of
issues
that
aren't
even
arguable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
in
the
anders
opinion
itself
there's
some
indication
that
we
wouldn't
preclude
other
systems
that
were
equally
as
effective,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
anders
isn't
necessarily
the
only
way
that
the
right
to
counsel
can
be
satisfied.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
so
odd
when
the
court
itself
says,
we
don't
want
it
and
need
it.
we
have
a
different
system
that
we
think
works
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
if
it's...
this
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
presumably,
and
the
court
says,
i
don't
need
it,
thank
you.
