mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
making
three
points.
first,
both
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
found
that
there
were
arguable
issues
in
this
case.
therefore,
like
the
defendant
in
penson,
robbins
had
a
right
under
douglas
v.
california
to
an
advocate's
brief
on
the
merits.
second,
robbins'
state
appellate
attorney
did
not
file
a
proper
anders
brief
in
this
case.
this
was
not
a
mere
technical
violation
of
anders.
there
was
no
advocacy.
a
nonlawyer
could
have
written
the
brief
or
document
which
was
filed
here.
as
the
warden
concedes,
it
does
not
refer
to
a
single
legal
issue.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
i
believe
the
remedy
should
be
prejudice
per
se,
your
honor,
because
the
federal
court
will
not
be
guided
by
the
advocacy
process,
would
not
be
able...
does
not
have
the
information,
would
have
to
speculate,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
found,
to
make
that
determination
without
an
advocate's
presentation,
if
there's
a
finding
of
an
arguable
issue
that
a
merits
brief
is
required.
if
there's
no
finding...
if...
the
federal
court
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
decide
if
there's
an
arguable
issue
with
an
inadequate
merits
brief
or
an
anders
brief.
if
there's
no
adequate
brief
that
refers
to
the
issues,
the
court
only
has
the
cold
record,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
found
that
that
is
insufficient
for
the
court
to
make
its
determination.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
well,
i
think
anders
is
an
efficient
procedure.
it
requires
the
lawyer
to
act
as
an
advocate.
the
federal
habeas
court
is
unable
to
make
the
determination
whether
the
appeal
is
wholly
frivolous,
which
is
constitutionally
required,
without
the
assistance
of
an
advocate
and,
as
i
think
a
question
was
asked
during
the
warden's
presentation,
it's
efficient
to
have
the
state
court
make
the
determination
in
the
first
instance.
the
federal
court's
determination
was,
was
there
a
denial
to
right
to
counsel,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
found
a
right
to
counsel
on
the
first
appeal
as
of
right.
in
fact,
pennsylvania
v.
findley
assumes
that
while
anders
may
not
be
mandatory
in
the
case
of
post
conviction
or
discretionary
appeals,
it
is
mandatory
where
there
is
such
a
underlying
constitutional
right.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
in
answer
to
your
question,
anders
requires
that
there
be
an
advocate
on
appeal.
in
most
cases
it
will
be
a
merits
brief,
but
if
the
lawyer
is
unable
to
do
that
because
of
ethical
reasons,
it
requires
an
anders
brief,
and
in
penson
this
court
distinguished
the
situation
between
where
a
lawyer
acts
as
an
advocate
but
acts
ineffectively,
in
which
case
there's
not
a
presumed
prejudice
standard,
and
the
situation
where
there
is
no
advocate
at
all,
and
we
would
submit
there
was
no
advocate
at
all
here,
because
a
proper
anders
brief
was
filed.
in
fact,
of
the
nine
issues
that
we
refer
to
in
our
brief,
not
one
of
those
are
even
hinted
at.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
your
honor,
the
aspect
of
anders
which
was
criticized
in
california
is
the
aspect
of
the
independent
judicial
review,
which
is
independently
required
by
california
law.
the
wende
case
that's
in
fact
one
of
the
two
issues
they
face,
they
interpret
anders
as
requiring
that.
we
would
submit
to
you
that
the
california
system,
while
certain
aspects
of
it
are
good,
and
there's
no
reason
that
they
can't
stay
under
what
we
promote,
they
can
still
have
this
appellate
project
system.
i
would
add
that
most
of
the
facts
concerning
that
system
are
not
in
the
record
of
this
case,
which
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
amicus
files,
but
more
importantly...
and
i
think
this
is
crystal
clear...
while
this
case
should
be
decided
under
federal
constitutional
law,
the
warden
has
mischaracterized
the
california
system,
and
i
would
refer
you
to
in
re
sade
c,
an
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court,
which
does
not
purport
to
break
any
new
ground.
it
just
refers
the
precedents
which
were
in
effect,
and
it
says
that
wende...
and
i'm
referring
to
page
787
of
actually
the
55
cal.
rptr.
2d
version,
but
wende
made
clear
that
in
such
a
situation
all
the
steps
specified
by
anders
had
to
be
taken,
other
than
those
dependent
on
filing
a
motion
to
withdraw.
the
implicit
rationale
is
that
for
present
purposes
substantial
withdrawal
is
equivalent
to
formal
withdrawal,
and
in
the
footnote
there
it
says
that
the
oregon
court
erred
in
finding
that
an
anders
brief
which
referred
to
issues
was
not
required.
so
our
position
is,
first
of
all
federal
constitutional
law
controls,
but
there
is
no
contrary
california
system.
if
this
court
looks
at
footnote
8
and
footnote
22
of
sade
c,
which
does
not
purport
to
break
new
ground,
it
just
refers
to
california
law.
footnote
22
says
very
clearly
that
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
that
case,
if
anders
was
to
apply...
the
court
concluded
that
anders
did
not
apply
in
that
case.
it
deals
with
a
custody
situation.
but
they
said
that
we
note
that
under
anders
none
of
the
briefs
submitted
by
appointed
appellant
counsel
would
have
been
sufficient.
anders
brief
must
contain
law
as
well
as
facts,
although
each
of
the
briefs
here,
and
i'm
paraphrasing,
has
facts,
none
has
law.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
yes,
but
i
think
from
an...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
first
of
all
i
think
terminology
is
important.
if
the
lawyer
found
arguable
issues,
then
a
merits
brief
is
required.
if
the
lawyer
found
no
arguable
issues,
and
the
state
had...
has
an
epic
system
that
did
not
allow
the
filing
of
a
merits
brief
in
that
situation,
an
anders
brief,
which
does
not
argue
issues...
and
anders
does
not
require
the
argument
of
federal
issues.
it
requires
the
reference
of
those
issues,
so...
and
the
reason
why
that's
important...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
the
points
served
by
that,
your
honor,
are
two,
and
the
anders
court
said
this.
the
court
said
it
in
mccoy
and
penson
first.
the
court
is
unable
to
make
its
determination
whether
the
appeal
is
wholly
frivolous
without
the
assistance
of
the
reference
of
legal
issues.
the
cold
record
is
insufficient.
second,
a
mere
conclusory
statement,
whether
it's
a
one-sentence
or
one
paragraph
in
anders,
or
the
type
of
brief
here,
which
does
not
refer
to
a
single
legal
issue,
does
not
give
the
court
information
to
make
the
second
determination
of
whether
the
attorney
was
effective,
or
by...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
the
purpose
of
an
anders
brief
is
not
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
yes.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
if
the
court
receives
such
a
brief,
the
court
will
be
able
to
look
at
those
issues
and
maybe
the
court
will
have
a
different
opinion
on
whether
those
issues
are
arguable
or
not.
maybe
the
court
will
see
that
this...
the
court
will
have
some
evidence
that
the
attorney
was
effective.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
that's
correct,
but...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
that's
correct.
mccoy
validated
what
could
be
called
anders
plus.
anders
requires
a
reference
to
issues.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
anders
requires,
in
fact...
requires
not
only
a
reference
of
the
relevance
facts
pertaining
to
those
issues,
but
a
reference
to
the
relevant
law
which
pertains
to
those
issues.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
penson,
explicitly
after
discussing
the
two
purposes
i
discussed,
said
that
a
third
purpose
said
that
it
provides
an
independent
inducement
to
counsel
to
do
what
douglas
requires,
which
is
to
diligently
review
the
record,
research
the
law,
and
by
putting
pen
to
paper,
with
that
discipline
you're
much
more
likely
to
find
an
arguable
issue
than
you
would
if
you
didn't
engage
in
that
process,
so
it
does
provide
an
independent
inducement.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
that
is
correct,
and
the
purpose
is
not
to
decide
them
on
the
merits,
but
you're
right.
i
think
it's
more
than
a
listing.
it's
a
reference
of
the
relevant
facts
and
the
relevant
law.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
in
many
ways
has
given
the
most
attention
of
the
circuit
courts
as
to
what
an
adequate
anders
brief,
then
judge
stevens'
opinion...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
in
response
to
that,
first
of
all
we're
talking
about
not...
we're
talking
about
issues
which
appear
to
be
frivolous.
there's
been
no
determination
that
they
are
frivolous.
but
i
don't
think
anders
requires
any
conceivable
frivolous
issues
such
as
a
thirteenth
juror.
i
think
that
the
types
of
issues
which
should
be
identified
are
those
which
a
trained
advocate,
and
this
comes
from
nichols,
would
identify
and
consider,
that
a
trained
advocate
would
identify
and
consider
in
the
evaluation
of
the
appeal.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
i
think
that's
correct.
if
you
take
the
most
simplest
of
proceedings,
a
guilty
plea,
with
a
very
standard
sentencing,
what
does
an
attorney
do?
i
think
that
an
attorney
in
that
case
should
at
least
refer
to
the
issues
such
as
voluntariness
of
a
plea,
whether
the
defendant
was
advised
of
rights,
whether
the
sentencing
was
in
the
range.
if
the
attorney
does
that,
the
appellate
court
will
have
the
information
to
decide,
1)
whether
the
appeal
is
wholly
frivolous,
2)
whether
the
attorney
provided
effective
assistance,
and
whether
he
did
his
duties
under
douglas
v.
california.
i
think
it's
a
very
workable
system.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
that's
right.
anders
is
not
only
constitutionally
required,
it's
an
efficient
system.
what's
being
complained
about
by
some
practitioners
or
judges
in
california
is
the
failure
to
file
an
anders
brief,
because
the
court
then
is
just
left
with
a
cold
record,
and
is
forced
to
do
the
whole
thing
itself.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
yes.
your
honor,
i
interpret
the
brief
as
the
judges'
commenting
on
policy,
not
constitutionality.
i
disagree
with
the
warden's
statement
that
their
statement
is
to,
in
a
sense,
agree
with
the
warden
that
the
california
system,
which
is
practiced
at
least
in
some
parts
of
california,
is
the
correct
system.
i
think
they're
talking
about
the
policy.
and
with
respect
to
the
cap
system,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
most
of...
the
only
thing
about
cap,
which
is
in
the
record,
came
out
the
first
time
at
the
federal
habeas
level,
when
mr.
goodwin,
the
appellate
attorney,
filed
a
declaration
where
he
said
he
consulted
with
an
appellate
attorney.
that
doesn't
indicate
that
they
independently
reviewed
the
record,
and
even
if
they
did,
that
was
the
situation
in
ellis
back
in,
i
think
it
was
in
'58
or
'63,
where
the
court
said
it
doesn't
matter
how
many
attorneys
looked
at
something
behind
closed
doors,
the
court
needs
the
assistance
of
an
advocate.
somebody
has
to
act
as
an
advocate.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
your
honor,
we
said
very
little
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
about
the
cap
system.
it
is
addressed
in
great
length
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
was
filed
on
our
behalf,
the
one
on
behalf
of
delgado.
our
position
on
the
cap
system
is,
first
of
all
it's
not
in
the
record
and
shouldn't
be
considered,
but
if
the
court
does
consider
it,
as
the
daskian
brief
points
out,
there
are
five
different
appellate
projects
in
california,
and
one
of
them
in
1990,
after
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
griffy,
where
the
courts
basically
said,
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case,
if
the
california
system
is
as
they
claim,
meaning
not
requiring
an
anders
brief,
it's
unconstitutional.
according
to
this
brief,
one
of
the
appellate
projects
at
that
time
switched
to
the
anders
system
and
according
to
this
brief
two
others
have,
but
i
would
caution
the
court,
none
of
this
is
in
the
record.
our
position
is
that
even
if...
1)
it's
not
in
the
record,
and
2),
even
if
there
was
a
second
attorney
who
reviewed
it,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
is
not
the
substitute
of
an
advocate's
brief,
and
an
anders
brief,
while
a
very
strange
form
of
advocacy,
is
still
an
advocate's
brief,
and
the
court
needs
that.
i
would
point
out
also
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
warden's
position
and
our
position
as
to
what
an
arguable
issue
is.
the
warden
i
think
would
ask
counsel
to
speculate
as
to,
in
a
sense
act
as
amicus
per
aes,
which
was
criticized
before
as
to
the
likely
success
of
an
issue.
i
think
in
mccoy
this
court
very
clearly
said
that
an
arguable
issue
is
any
issue
that
has
any
basis
in
fact
or
law,
and
i
think
the
nine
issues
that
we
set
forth,
and
we
only
need
one...
and
the
lower
courts
didn't
say
that
there
were
not
more
than
two.
they
said
there
were
at
least
two.
i
think
that
if
this
court...
and
this
is
not
only
a
case
of
equal
protection.
due
process
concerns,
ebbitts
made
that
very
clear,
as
well
as
sixth
amendment
concerns
are
present,
too.
if
one
applies
the
balancing
test,
which
in
mlb
was
discussed
again
last
term,
there
is
a
fundamental
interest
at
stake
here,
the
right
to
counsel
on
the
first
appeal
as
of
right,
and
if
you
look
at
the
state
interest,
anders
is
efficient.
all
it
requires
the
attorney
to
do
is
to
put
pen
to
paper,
to
put...
he
had
to
go...
he
or
she
has
to
go
through
that
process
anyway.
it
doesn't
involve
greater
expenditures.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
it's
efficient
for
judges.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
the...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
advocacy
is
necessary
to
reliably
decide
a
case,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
lawyer
has...
anders
is
a
limited
exception.
a
merits
brief
is
much
preferred.
anders
is
just
a
recognition
that
there
are
certain
state
ethical
rules
that
sometimes
prohibit
that.
so
i
think
any
system
would
require
a
form
of
advocacy
to
give
the
court
the
information
it
needs,
because
a
cold
record
is
insufficient,
and
i
should
add...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
i
should
add
that
anders,
mccoy,
and...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
first
of
all,
that's
what
the
warden...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
california
courts
have
not
said
that.
in
fact,
they've
said
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
warden
says,
and
in
terms
of
a
policy
matter,
that's
what
the
retired
judges
are
saying.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
they
need
that
brief.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
not
at
all,
your
honor.
if
this
court
reads
the
wende
opinion,
there
were
two
questions
raised
in
wende,
1)
whether
the
appellate
court
had
to
make
an
independent
review
of
the
whole
record,
and
the
second
question
wende
considered
was
whether
counsel
had
to
formally
withdraw.
now...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the...
many
california
courts...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
have
misinterpreted
their
own
law,
and...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
well,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
answer
for
the
ultimate
question
for
this
court
is
whether
the
system
meets
constitutional
standards,
but
california's
argument
that
their
system
is
consistent
with
california
law
independent
informs
this
court's
analysis
on
each
of
the
three
questions.
it's
part
of
the
bierdenberg
v.
georgia
balancing
of
interests.
if
the
states...
if...
you
have
to
look...
obviously,
the
high
court
of
california
is
the
ultimate
authority
on
california
law,
not
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
not
the
warden,
and
if
they've
said
an
anders
brief
is
required,
that
affects
the
balancing
of
interests.
it
also,
when
the
california
supreme
court
states
that
though
an
attorney...
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
that
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
answer
about...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
refer
you
to
wende,
and
i
agree
that
wende
is
not
the
clearest...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
well,
your
honor,
if
that
was
the
choice,
i
would
agree
with
you.
i'm
referring
you
to
what
the
california
supreme
court
said
in
wende,
and
what
it
made
crystal
clear,
not
seeking
to
break
any
new
ground
in
sade
c.
it
said,
in
california
an
anders
brief
must
refer
to
law
as
well
as
facts,
and...
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
no,
it
should
not
affect.
we
should
still
win,
your
honor,
because
if
one
goes
back
and
reads
the
state's
briefs
in
anders
v.
california,
they
are
an
exact
replay
of
their
arguments
here.
they
argued
there
there
was
a
multi-tiered
review
of
several
attorneys.
they
argued
there
that
there
was
an
independent
judicial
review
of
the
whole
record,
and
this
court
found
that
insufficient.
why,
and
again
i
go
back
to
the
purposes,
because
the
court...
the
cold
record
is
not
enough
for
the
court
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
the
appeal
is
wholly
frivolous,
nor
was
it
enough
to
determine
whether
counsel
provided
effective
assistance.
the
brief
here
only...
a
high
school
student
could
have
written
this
brief.
it
first
of
all
misses
most
of
the
important
pretrial
proceedings,
and
even
its
summary
of
the
facts,
it's
a
nonlawyer's
discussion.
it's
a
summary
of
a
witness-by-witness
basis.
there's
no
advocate's
basis.
i
should
add
here
that
the
failure
of
advocacy
goes
beyond,
in
this
case,
the
mere
file...
the
failure
to
file
an
advocate's
brief,
whether
merits
or
anders.
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
in
penson
discussed
that
there's
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
attorney
conscientiously
reviewed
the
record
in
that
case.
there's
plenty
of
reason
to
doubt
that
in
this
case.
many
of
the
important
pretrial
proceedings
weren't
even
transcribed
at
the
time,
so
the
attorney
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
that,
the
appellate
court
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
that.
in
fact...
and
then
penson
discusses
that
one
of
the
important
responsibilities
of
an
advocate
is
to
ensure
that
the
appellate
court
has
a
full
record.
the
appellate
attorney
here
failed
in
that
obligation.
robbins
actually
made
several
motions
to
augment
the
record
before
the
state
court
of
appeal.
the
attorney
did
not
support
those
efforts.
in
fact,
many
key
portions,
the...
one
of
the
arguable
issues
we
raise
is
the
denial
of
the
motion
to...
for
destruction
of
evidence.
the
warden
points
out
in
their
reply
brief
that
robbins
said
at
one
point,
this
motion
has
already
been
heard,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
we're
not
going
to
hear
it
again.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
record,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
it
actually
was
heard.
robbins
was
probably
confused.
the
hearings,
which...
between
the
filing
of
that
motion
and
that
colloquy,
if
you
look
at
the
minute
order,
that's
all
we
have.
none
of
them
indicate
that
the
motion
was
actually
heard,
and
so
robbins
actually
pointed
to
each
of
these
key
motions
and
hearings
in
his
motions
to
augment,
and
the
appellate
court
denied
that,
and
i
think
that
was
probably
in
contravention
of
california
law
to
look
at
the
whole
record.
and
goodwin,
the
attorney
didn't
support
it.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
the
relevant
rule
is
california
rule
of
court
33,
and
it's
been
amended,
i
don't
think
substantively,
from
back
when
this
appeal
was
decided
on
today.
it
does
not...
it
requires
all
motions
which
were
denied
to
be
part
of
the
appellate
record,
and
in
fact
all
motions
which
were
denied
were
not
part
of
the
record
on
appeal
in
this
case.
it
does
not
to
my
knowledge...
it
does
not
require
all
pretrial
proceedings,
but
there
is
a
mechanism,
if
those
are
relevant
to
deciding
an
issue
of
appeal,
to
request
them.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
yes,
your
honor.
the
transcripts
were
prepared
during
the
state
habeas
proceedings
before
i
was
appointed
as
counsel.
robbins
did
that
on
his
own.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
he
caused
a
reporter
to
prepare
those.
those
transcripts
were
attached
to
the
state
habeas
and,
of
course,
to
the
federal
habeas
petition.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
his
own
expense.
mr.
ronald
j.
nessim
now,
i
would...
to
stress,
in
terms
of
the
prejudice
per
se
standard,
you
know,
there
is
a
difference
between...
and
penson
expressly
recognizes
this,
between
providing
some
advocacy
that's
ineffective
and
no
advocacy
at
all.
in
fact,
in
both...
ebbitts
refers
to
anders
and
entsminger,
cases
where
the
attorneys
did
not
formally
withdraw,
and
notes
that
they
were
represented
by
counsel
in
name
only
and,
in
fact,
they
had
no
counsel
at
all.
like
those
defendants,
robbins
in
this
case
had
to
shift
entirely
for
himself,
and
penson
refers
to
both
cronic
and
saterwaite
v.
texas
as
cases
which
obviously
involve
trial
error.
but
that...
penson
expressly
extends
them
to
the
appellate
area
and
says,
when
an
attorney
fails
to
act
as
an
advocate
in
a
proceeding,
the
error
pervades
the
entire
proceeding
and
can
never
be
harmless,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
court
would
have
to
speculate
without
the
assistance
of
an
advocate,
and
we've
also
discussed
the
additional
reasons
of
comity
and
judicial
efficiency.
i
would
add
that
we
believe
that
even
if
the
strickland
standard
was
applied
in
this
case,
that
we
would
prevail.
we
have
raised
substantive
issues.
there's
a
reasonable
probability
sufficient
to
undermine
the
confidence.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
