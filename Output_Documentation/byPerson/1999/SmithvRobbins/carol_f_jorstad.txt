ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
one
of
the
hardy
perennials
of
american
law,
what
to
do
with
a
meritless
criminal
appeal
when
that
appeal
is
brought
by
an
appointed
lawyer
on
behalf
of
an
indigent
client,
and
what
the
standard
of
reversal
in
such
cases
should
be.
this
court
addressed
the
problem
in
anders
v.
california,
holding
that
the
indigent
appellant
in
that
case
had
his
equal
protection
and
due
process
rights
to
counsel
on
appeal
violated
by
california's
conclusory
no-merit
letter.
anders
has
two
component
parts.
the
first
is
the
identification
of
the
constitutional
rights
at
stake,
and
the
second
is
the
setting
forth
of
a
procedure
by
which
those
rights
can
be
vindicated.
the
ninth
circuit
thinks
that
the
anders
framework,
the
second
part,
is
compulsory.
we
think
not.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
insistence
on
rigid,
programmatic
adherence
to
that
procedure
has
undermined
california's
legitimate
efforts
to
provide
effective
assistance
to
indigent
appellants.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
strickland
test
for
ineffective
assistance
should
apply
to
meritless
indigent
appeals.
federal
habeas
is
intended
to
guard
against
extreme
malfunctions
in
the
state
procedure.
ordinarily,
federal
courts
presume
the
regularity
of
state
court
judgments,
but
not
in
no-merit
cases.
in
those
cases,
prejudice
is
presumed.
this
is
presents
problems,
because
it
is
altogether
too
one-sided,
and
because
it
turns
the
presumption
of
regularity
on
its
head.
a
presumption
of
prejudice
should
be
reserved
for
cases
where
the
error
is
so
systemic
that
it's
impossible
to
judge
what
the
harm
is,
and
the
examples
given
generally
are
those
of
judicial
bias
and
actual
denial
of
counsel.
we
urge
that
strickland
be
adopted
to
bring
this
one
anomalous
situation
into
conformity
with
other
cases
where
deficient
performance
by
counsel
is
urged.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
that's
not
an
overall
concern.
i
think
if
we
look
at
this
in
the
context
of
merits
briefs,
where
counsel
raises
one
or
two
or
three
issues,
but
fails
to
raise
one
or
two
or
three
others,
the
federal
courts
are
in
much
the
same
position.
they're
going
to
have
to
look...
in
a
strickland
context,
there
is
no
presumption
of
prejudice,
but
in
a
strickland
context
they're
going
to
have
to
look
at
these
other
issues
that
will
be
asserted
on
federal
habeas,
and
of
course,
they
should
have
been
exhausted
in
state
court
as
well,
so
it
won't
be
the
first
time.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
position
on
this
matter
is
that
the
first
component
of
anders,
that
is,
the
rights
to
be
vindicated,
is
strictly
constitutional.
it
goes
to
effective
or
ineffective
assistance,
and
can
always
be
raised
in
federal
court.
the
second
part
of
anders,
this
prophylactic
framework,
is
not
constitutional.
this
is
a
matter
of
pragmatic
suggestion
by
the
court
in
anders,
and
we
believe
that
these
rights
can
be
vindicated.
after
all,
what
we're
talking
about
is
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
we're
talking
about
equal
protection,
and
to
a
lesser
extent,
due
process,
and
the
laboratory
of
the
states
should
be
allowed
to
develop
these
procedures
in
ways
that
make
sense
in
those
states,
as
long
as
they
vindicate
the
underlying
rights.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
certainly
don't
think
that
any
court
is
free
to
ignore
this
court,
but
i
would
say
that
lower
federal
courts
certainly
seem
to
me
to
be
obliged,
because
of
this
court's
supervisory
powers
in
addition
to
its
constitutional
jurisdiction,
to
follow
whatever
procedure
this
court
sets
forth,
but
it
has
been
the
custom
over
many,
many
years
for
state
courts
to
have
some
flexibility
in
interpreting
this
court's
procedural
suggestions...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
but
if
it
is
mandatory?
if
it
is
mandatory,
if,
in
fact,
this
court
said
what
it
meant
and
meant
what
it
said
in
anders,
and
if
this
court
holds
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
procedure
were
required,
then
california
is
not
in
compliance.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
would
agree
with
that.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
what
was
decided
in
anders
was
that
it
didn't
provide
counsel
at
all
and,
of
course,
anders
antedated
strickland
by
17
years,
so
there
was
no
real
test
for
prejudice
in
that
case.
california
took
anders
very
seriously,
and
so...
and
people
v.
feggans
followed
it
very,
very
closely,
but
over
time,
things
changed,
and
what
has
happened
in
the
last
32
years
and
even
less,
really,
is
that
california's
system
for
providing
representation
to
indigents
has
become
more
and
more
sophisticated,
has
become
more
established.
this
is
not
a
situation
any
longer.
there
is
no
indigent
in
the
state
of
california
who
will
be
represented
by
some
solo
lawyer
who
crawls
out
of
the
woodwork.
everybody
is
responsible
to
the
appellate
projects.
the
appellate
projects
actually
seek
out
lawyers,
they
train
them,
they
match
lawyers...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
let
me...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that's...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
if
i
may
recap,
that's
i
guess
correct
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
there
are
other
aspects
to
it.
when
the
lawyer
has
decided
that
there's
no
merit
to
the
brief,
and
when
his
appellate
supervisor,
his
appellate
project
supervisor,
who's
an
expert,
concurs,
he
may
file
a
brief
under
california
procedure
in
which
he
sets
forth
a
detailed
statement
of
the
case
and
statement
of
the
facts
with
citations
to
the
record
which
help
the
court
to
know
that
the
record
has
been
read
and
considered.
in
the
record,
in
the
brief
filed
in
this
particular
case,
counsel
mentioned
in
his
statement
of
the
case
that
there
had
been
a
faretta
motion,
that
the
appellant's
competency
had
been
tested,
and
that
there
had
been
two
so-called
marsden
motions.
in
california
they're
for
replacement
of
counsel.
so
those
issues
were
kind
of
identified
in
the
statement
of
the
case.
in
addition,
you're
correct
in
saying,
justice
o'connor,
that
he
does
not
withdraw,
and
he
asks
the
court...
he
also
does
not,
pursuant
to
the
wende
case,
argue
against
his
client.
what
he
does
is
to
ask
the
court
to
make
an
independent
review.
this
allows
the
court
to
look
at
the
record
without
having
a
list
of
issues
that
counsel
has
read,
researched,
and
rejected.
the
idea
here
is
to
have
the
court
take
a
fresh
look,
and
that
is
in
fact
the
holding
of
wende,
is
that
an
independent
review
by
the
court
is
required.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
no,
he
would
not
assist
the
court,
your
honor.
i
think
the
main
thing
to
be
aware
of
in
the
california
system
is
that
the
effort
is
to
have
the
advocacy
come
at
the
front
end.
there's
something
like
the
emperor's
new
clothes
about
saying
vigorous
advocacy
in
the
context
of
a
brief
that's
decided...
that
they
decide
has
no
merit.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
your
honor,
first
of
all
i
would
say
that
i
certainly
agree
that
the...
that
any
appellant
has
a
right
to
a
conscientious
and
diligent
lawyer
who
looks
for
issues.
the
question
really,
and
the
point
of
controversy
really
is,
what
is
that
lawyer
to
do
when
he
can't
find
any,
there's
nothing
there,
and
there
are
cases
like
that.
there
simply
is
nothing
to
raise
that
would
not
be
violative
of...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
nobody...
well,
first
of
all,
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
have
been
two
issues
raised
in
this
context,
and
i
think
both
of
them
are,
frankly,
the
definition
of
frivolousness.
the
first
was,
there
was
a
complaint...
well,
no,
there
was
not
a
complaint.
the
district
court
itself
essentially
raised
the
issue
of
the
law
library
and
its
adequacy.
the...
i
had
said
all
along
that
the
law
library
only
came
up
in
the
context
of
the
judge's
faretta
warnings
to
mr.
robbins
telling
him
all
of
the
parade
of
horribles
that
he
would
face
if
he
went
pro
per.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
that's
absolutely...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes.
well,
let
me...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
it
did
not.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
actually
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes,
your
honor,
we
do,
because
there
was
a
declaration
by
counsel,
and
i
believe
it's
in
the
joint
appendix...
yes,
at
page
43.
this
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
and
he
said
prior
to
the
filing
of
briefs
i
consulted
with
the
california
appellate
project
and
received
their
permission
to
file
a
wende
brief.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
it
does
not.
we
do
have
the
rules,
and
we
do
have
the
very
excellent
brief
of
the
california
academy.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
don't
know
the
rules
verbatim,
but
they
provide
for
supervision,
review,
and
concurrence
on
no-merit
briefs.
i
would
like
to
add
that...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
either
somebody
on
the
attorney's
staff
or
a
justice
reviews
the
entire
record
from
scratch.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
think,
again,
to
return
to
an
earlier
theme,
that
it
only
really
makes
sense
to
talk
about
an
adversary
system
if
there
is
some
basis
for
adversarial
representation.
if
there
is
no
merit,
a
lawyer
in
california
and
in
most
other
jurisdictions
cannot
raise
a
frivolous
issue.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
let
me
take
those
two
questions
seriatim.
as
far
as
the
discipline
of
writing
down
why
the
issue
is
no
good,
i
think
if
we
try
to
step
back
a
little
and
look
at
what's
the
basis
for
requiring
that
might
be,
we're
talking
here
about
the
right
to
counsel,
and
we're
talking
about
mostly
equal
protection.
if
you
analyze
this
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection,
it
would
simply
never
be
true.
i
can
say
categorically
that
retained
counsel
would
have
to
explain
to
the
court
why
he
failed
to
raise
the
issues
he
doesn't
raise,
nor
would
appointed
counsel,
who
raises...
you
know,
even
if
counsel
in
a
merits
brief
raises
a
single
extremely
marginal
issue,
that
counsel
would
never
have
to
say
to
the
court,
here
are
the
other
issues
i
considered,
and
here
are
the
cases
that
say
why
they're
no
good.
it
just
doesn't
happen.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
we
do
have...
justice
ginsburg,
you
said,
trust
me,
and
i
think
we
should
afford
similar
trust
to
lawyers
who
write
no-merit
briefs
that
we
give
to
lawyers
who
write
merits
briefs,
and
specifically
i
would
point
out
that
under
the
current
system
it
takes
a
lot
of
courage
to
write
a
no-merit
brief.
now,
first
of
all,
i
would
also
add
that
it's
not
as
if
the
lawyer
who
presents
a
no-merit
brief
can
just
kind
of
write
it
off
and
hand
it
in
and
go
away
with
his
money.
he
has
to
justify
himself
to
the
appellate
project.
the
appellate
project
is
going
to
give
it
and
him
an
advocate's
review.
they're
going
to
give
very
close
scrutiny,
and
they
are
going
to
know
things
that
no
court
will
ever
be
able
to
know,
because
they
may
be
told
in
confidence
by
the
client...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
well,
i
mean,
i
certainly...
i
guess
that's
possible.
i
would
say
that
penson
v.
ohio,
the...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
your
honor,
this
is...
no,
your
honor,
that's...
there
are
other
differences.
first
of
all,
in
penson
the
attorney
did
write
just
a
certificate.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
california
does
is
far
more
than
that.
the
statement
of
a
case,
the
statement
of
the
facts
is
a
guarantee
that
somebody's
been
through
that
record
and
knows
what's
in
it,
and
isn't
just
filing
a
letter
out
of
laziness.
that's
one
thing.
a
second
thing
is
that
in
penson
the
lawyer
was
really,
really
wrong.
that
is
to
say,
he
was...
he
said
there
were
no
issues
at
all.
the
court,
after
having
dismissed
him,
found
a
number
of
issues
and,
more
importantly,
found
a
single
issue
which
resulted
in
the
reversal
of
a
count,
a
big
mistake.
now,
penson
i
think
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
there
had
been
a
strickland
test
as
a
presumption
of
prejudice,
but
it's
very,
very
different,
because
in
penson
the,
really
the
largest
fault
was
the
court's,
and
that
is
in
failing
to
appoint
counsel
once
they
knew
that
the
first
counsel
had
missed
big,
arguable
issues.
that
would
never
happen
in
california.
in
california...
and
it
was
in
penson
the
state
reviewing
board
itself
which
found
the
errors
and
failed
to
appoint
counsel.
in
california,
if
a
state...
if
the
state
court
finds
that
there
are
issues
that
should
have
been
raised,
even
counsel
who
has
not
yet
been
dismissed,
or
a
new
counsel
in
some
cases
will
be
appointed
and
has
to
brief
those
issues.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
it
has,
and
i
would
like
to
say,
justice
ginsburg,
that
unlikely
as
it
may
seem,
i
have
pretty
good
reason
to
believe
that
judges
and/
or
their
research
attorneys
do,
in
fact,
go
through
these
records.
it's
a
terrible
burden,
and
the
way...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i'm
sorry?
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
well,
i
can't
speak
for
the
entire
bench
in
california,
but
i
do
know
that
we
have
reported
decisions,
published
decisions
in
which
judges
complain
bitterly
about
the
amount
of
time...
i
mean,
they're
not
happy,
all
of
them,
to
be
doing
this
work.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
well,
your
honor,
it's
interesting,
because
both
sides
of
the...
not
both
sides
of
the
bench,
but
both
sides
of
the
bar,
both
the
people
and
the
defense,
feel
the
same
way
about
this.
i
think
that
when
you
talk
about
having
reasons
stated
to
the
court
for
issues
that
have
been
rejected,
again
we
need
to
look
at
what
constitutional
interest
would
be
satisfied
by
that.
if
we're
talking
about
the
sixth
amendment,
or
about
equal
protection,
i
don't
think
that
that
answers
those
things
at
all,
because
in
fact
a
client...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
as
of
a
few
years
ago
it
was
in
roughly
20
percent
to,
maybe,
in
some
districts
as
much
as
25.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
they
do
not,
your
honor.
it
does
happen.
i've
seen
it
happen.
i
started
to
say
a
little
bit
earlier,
i
think
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that
it
takes
a
lot
of
courage
under
the
current
system
to
file
a
wende
brief.
these...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
believe
you
are.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
the
counsel
who
are
appointed
by
the
court...
or,
excuse
me,
appointed
by
the
appellate
projects,
and
that
duty
is
delegated
by
the
courts,
don't
have
enormous
case
loads,
at
least
from
the
appellate
project,
because
the
work
is
divided
up
and
i
think
a
reasonable
workload
is
assumed
and,
of
course,
whatever
the
workload
is
for
these
people
who
file
no-merit
briefs,
the
same
could
be
said
for
people
who
are
filing
merits
briefs.
we
don't
monitor
them.
we
shouldn't
monitor
these
folks.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
think,
your
honor,
that
these
attorneys
are
equally
as
well
able
to
control
their
work
load.
they
are
not,
as
is
true
in
the
attorney
general's
office,
a
member
of
an
office
where
the
work
load
is
what
it
is
and
comes
at
you
the
way
it
comes
at
you.
they...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
yes,
they
are.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
thank
you
for
asking,
justice
kennedy,
because
that
is
the
point
of
this
brief.
they
don't
like
the
procedure
very
much,
these
particular
judges,
and
the
thing
they
don't
like
about
it
is,
they
say
it's
inefficient,
they
say
it
makes
the
court
work
too
hard,
they
say
it's
a
waste
of
resources,
but
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
that
brief,
there
is
no
claim
that
there's
any
constitutional
deficiency
in
california's
procedure.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
thank
you.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i
think
we
should
be
very
clear
about
what
advocacy
means
in
the
context
of
an
anders
brief,
or
a
no-merit
brief
generally.
up
front,
it
means,
giving
the
client
the
benefit
of
professional
judgment,
of
professional
skill,
professional
analysis.
in
california,
there's
also
even
more
professional
review,
and
a
whole
system
built
around
that.
but
once
there's
been
a
no-merit
determination
made
by
counsel,
when
you
talk
about
advocacy,
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
advocating
for
the
other
side.
telling
the
court
what
issues
it
can
readily
reject
cannot
help
having
some,
at
least
subliminal,
if
not
more,
effect
on
the
mind
set
of
the
judges
who
are
reading
that
brief.
far
better
for
the
client
if
also...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
and
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
what
we
can
say
about
mccoy
is
that
this
court
approved
that
procedure,
which
was
in
fact
a
deviation
from
anders,
but
it
didn't
require
it.
california,
i
believe,
has
much
more
concern
for
the
client.
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
i
under...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
that's
correct,
your
honor,
just
as,
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection,
no
client
with
retained
counsel
would
ever
put
before
the
court
a
discussion
of
the
legal
issues
he
rejected.
it
just
wouldn't
happen.
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
reason
to
be
unduly
suspicious
of
lawyers
who
write
no-merit
briefs.
it's
a
hard
thing
to
do.
it
requires
much
more
in
the
way
of
approval
from
the
appellate
project
in
california.
the
sanctions
against
the
lawyer
are
potentially
far
greater.
he's
subject
to
a
presumed
prejudice
standard
rather
than
a
strickland
standard.
the
much
easier
course
would
be
to
raise
something
like
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
which
most
everybody...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
well,
in
strickland...
but
on
appeal
strickland...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
but
strickland
also
applies
on
appeal
in
merits
situations,
and
that's
when
a
new
appeal
is
given.
it
would
be
wrong
to
force
the
state
to
give
appeals
willy
nilly
in
situations
like
this
one,
quite
specifically.
here,
the
two
issues
that
have
been
suggested
as
the
most
meritorious
by
the
two
courts...
ms.
carol
f.
jorstad
thank
you,
your
honor.
