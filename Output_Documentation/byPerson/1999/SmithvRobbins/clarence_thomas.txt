justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
robbins
was
convicted
of
murder
and
grand
theft.
on
appeal,
his
appointed
counsel
determined
that
an
appeal
would
be
frivolous
and
therefore
filed
with
the
state
appellate
court,
a
special
brief
known
as
a
wende
brief.
that
court,
agreeing
with
the
counsel’s
assessment
of
the
appeal,
affirmed.
respondent,
after
unsuccessfully
pursuing
state
postconviction
relief,
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
district
court.
that
court
granted
the
writ
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
our
decision
in
anders
versus
california
established
the
exclusive
procedure
that
appellate
counsel
may
follow
upon
determining
that
an
appeal
is
frivolous.
it
further
concluded
that
respondent’s
counsel
by
following
the
wende
procedure
instead
provided
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
anders
did
not
establish
an
exclusive
procedure
for
the
states;
instead,
anders
merely
held
that
in
order
to
vindicate
indigent’s
right
to
appellate
counsel,
states
must
establish
procedures
that
reasonably
ensure
that
any
decision
to
dismiss
an
appeal
as
frivolous
or
to
allow
a
counsel
to
withdraw
from
an
appeal
will
be
made
in
a
way
that
is
related
to
the
merit
of
that
appeal.
within
the
broad
bounds
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
sets,
states
are
free
to
experiment.
the
procedure
that
anders
set
out
is
an
acceptable
one
as
is
the
one
that
we
approved
over
a
decade
ago
in
mccoy
versus
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
the
wende
procedure
is
likewise
acceptable.
it
is
superior
to
many
procedures
that
we
have
previously
found
invalid,
and
it
is
on
par
with
the
anders
and
mccoy
procedures.
we
further
conclude
that
any
claim
that
counsel
acted
deficiently
in
choosing
to
file
a
brief
pursuant
to
wende
or
some
other
valid
procedure,
rather
than
file
a
merits
brief,
is
governed
by
the
well-established
standards
of
strickland
versus
washington
for
determining
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
in
such
a
case,
the
indigent
appellate
has
not
been
deprived
of
counsel
altogether,
and
there
is
therefore
no
reason
to
exempt
that
appellate
from
the
usual
requirement
that
he
demonstrate
prejudice
from
his
counsel’s
deficient
conduct.
we
remand
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
strickland
to
respondent’s
claim.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
