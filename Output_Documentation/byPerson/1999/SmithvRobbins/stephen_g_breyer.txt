yes,
but
the
thing
i
wonder...
i
think
california
has
a
pretty
good
system,
frankly,
and
if
i
were
designing
one,
maybe
it
would
be
california's,
but
the
problem
that
i
see
is
that
we
have
an
adversary
system,
basically,
in
the
country
and
anders
says,
you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
criminal
defendant,
and
you
have
a
right,
as
part
of
that,
to
have
the
lawyer
think
through
on
appeal
what
are
his
best
arguments.
now,
we
want
him
to
go
through
that
process,
write
down
what
his
best
arguments
are,
and
if
he
thinks
they're
still
no
good,
tell
us
why.
that's
part
of
what
it
is
to
be
an
advocate,
and
that's
part
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
lawyer,
and
that's
part
of
a
right
to
a
lawyer
that
you
have.
now,
given
our
adversarial
system,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
question.
i'd
be
awfully
worried
about...
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that,
suppose...
what
you're
saying
is,
if
lawyer
a,
who's
a
good
lawyer,
perfectly
good,
it's
not
inadequate
assistance,
brings
an
appeal
and
leaves
out
issue
1
in
the
state
court
and
argues
the
rest
of
it.
issue
1
is
gone.
it's
waived,
unless
it
was
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel,
which
i
assume
it
wasn't.
you're
saying
lawyer
a
did
exactly
the
same
thing,
but
not
having
found
any
other
issues,
he
files
an
anders
brief,
which
in
every
other
respect
is
fine,
and
under
those
circumstances
we
have
two
more
procedures,
1)
the
procedure
in
habeas
court
where
the
habeas
judge
says,
i
guess
it's
arguable,
you
should
have
raised
it,
and
then
back
we
go
to
state
court,
and
this
time
it
wasn't
waived.
now,
trying
to
reconcile
that's
impossible
in
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
other
question
which
i
have,
a
more
important
question,
on
which
i'm
quite
undecided.
california
seems
to
me
to
have
a
pretty
good
system,
frankly.
i
mean,
if
i
were
a
criminal
defense
lawyer,
i
might
say
they
had
a
better
system,
because
a
lawyer
who
wants
to
file
an
anders
brief
is
not
going
to
be
an
enthusiast,
while
the
staff
attorneys
are
paid
to
find
those
issues.
so
to
decide
for
you
might
require
me
to
decide
for
a
system
that's
actually
going
to
give
the
criminal
defendant
a
less-good
shot
at
the
appeal,
and
that's
worrying
me,
so
i
want
to
know
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
the
purpose
of
anders
in
part,
which
you
haven't
referred
to,
so
i
might
be
wrong,
was
to
say
to
the
lawyer,
lawyer,
do
the
following:
read
the
transcript
now,
when
you
read
the
transcript,
think
what
is
the
best
argument
i
could
make.
now,
write
it
down,
and
then
if
you
want
give
the
reasons
why
it
isn't
that
great,
but
it
forces
the
lawyer
to
go
through
that
advocacy
process,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
he
may
find
some
issues.
that,
i
thought,
was
the
major
purpose
of
anders,
but
you
didn't
refer
to
that,
so
maybe
i
was
wrong.
