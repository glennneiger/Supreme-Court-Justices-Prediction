ms.
jorstad,
one
thing
that
is
bothering
me
about
this
argument
is,
it's
a
kind
of
a
trust-me
argument.
there
is
something
disciplined
to
writing
out
reasons
why
i
have
concluded
that
although
these
issues
i
could
identify,
they
are
not
worthy
of
the
court's
attention.
the
discipline
of
saying
why,
explaining
why,
it's
just
like
for
a
court.
a
court
has
to
give
reasons
for
what
it
does,
and
sometimes,
in
writing
out
those
reasons,
one
discovers
that
something
isn't
right,
that
it
won't
write,
so
the
discipline
that
a
lawyer
has
to
go
through
in
saying,
this
is
my
thought
process,
this
is
how
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion,
then
none
of
that
appears.
none
of
that
appears
on
the
record.
we
haven't
got
a
clue.
and
something
else,
too,
frankly,
that
bothers
me
is,
the
notion
that
there
is
a
judge
who's
going
to
read
through
this
whole
record
in
these
no-merits
cases
doesn't
comport
with
reality.
isn't
the
reality
that
there's
going
to
be
some
staff
counsel,
not
even
a
law
clerk
to
the
judge,
who
is
going
to
read
this
and
present
it
to
a
panel
and
say,
no
merit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
or
uniformly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some,
or
uniformly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
appellate
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
suggested,
i
think,
in
your
brief
that
these
appellate
projects
where
not
uniform
in
their
approach,
and
that
some
of
them
do
require
an
identification
of
issues
that
the
lawyer
considered.
i
think
there's
some
disagreement
about
that.
can
you
tell
us
a
little
bit
more
about...
it's
rather
foggy
what
these
appellate
projects
are.
ms.
jorstad
said
that
they
are
run
by
experts,
that
the
staff
of
experts
in
these
matters...
but
i'm
a
little
unclear
on
exactly
what
these
animals
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
reject
your
view
of
what
those
two
cases
stand
for,
and
we
accept
that
the
california
procedure
is,
you
do
not
have
to
identify
issues
that
you
considered
along
the
way,
let's
assume
that
that
is
the
california
law,
does
that
affect
whether
you
should
win
or
lose?
