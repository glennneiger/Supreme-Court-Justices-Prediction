justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wasn't
the
issue...
not
the
original
faretta,
but
later
in
the
proceeding
it
is
argued,
i
don't
know
if
the
record
supports
it,
that
the
defendant
made
known
a
desire
to
have
assistance
of
counsel
later
on...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the,
what
would
pass
as
an
anders
brief
by
the
lawyer.
what
is
mentioned
is
the
original
threat
of
going.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also...
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
that
his
statement
did
mention
that
another
lawyer
in
the
public
defender's
office
reviewed
what
he'd
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
know
from
the
record
whether
that
was
actually
done,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
don't
know
what
the
appellate...
he
asked
permission
to
file,
and
he
got
permission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
show
that
the
appellate
project
read
through
the
record
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
the
certificate
in
penson
v.
ohio.
maybe
they
didn't
have
a
second
one
look
at
it.
why
don't
we
trust...
why
wouldn't
we
trust
that
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
difference
between
the...
his
certificate
and
the
certificate
in
this
case
is,
you've
also
got
a
statement
of
facts
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you
disagree
with
the
representations
made
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
retired
california
judges,
who
say
the
system
isn't
working
very
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
so?
let
me...
excuse
me.
could
i
just
make
this
one
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
mccoy
holds
to
the
contrary
on
that,
because
mccoy
approved
the
wisconsin
procedure
in
which,
after
identifying
arguable
issues,
if
the
lawyer
went
ahead
and
explained
why
he
thought
they
did
not
justify
a
merits
brief,
that
satisfied
anders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
to
me
a
little
bit
more
about
california's
rules
on
getting
the
whole
record
typed
up
and
provided.
did
he
have
a
right
to
have
everything
typed
up,
or
did
he
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
showing
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
parts
that
hadn't
been
typed
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
they
get
typed
up
in
this
case?
did
you
have
to
order
that,
or
did...
how
did
it...
you
said
that
they
weren't
typed
up
in
time
for
the
california
appellate
court
to
have
read
them.
is
that
shown
by
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
do
that
at
his
own
expense,
or
state
expense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we
rejected
that
point
in
the
wisconsin
case,
mccoy,
didn't
we?
we
said
it's
perfectly
okay
if
he
spells
out
the
reasons
why
he
thinks
there's
no
merit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
didn't
hold
it
was
a
deviation
from
anders.
we
held
it
was
perfectly
consistent
with
anders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
performed
the
function
of
having
a
lawyer
identify
for
the
court
in
a
way
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
when
it
looks
through
the
record
what
arguable
issues
are
there,
and
this...
it
required
that
there
be
some
discussion
of
legal
issues,
and
that's
what's
missing
here.
you
don't
have
any
discussion
of
legal
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
the
difference
in
the
prejudice
is,
in
strickland
the
fellow
gets
a
new
trial.
here,
the
only
thing
that's
at
stake
is
whether
there
has
to
be
a
merits
brief
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he's
not
going
to
get
out
of
jail
if
there's
a
violation
of
anders.
