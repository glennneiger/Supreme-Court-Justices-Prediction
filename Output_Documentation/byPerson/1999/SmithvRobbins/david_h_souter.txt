justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
jorstad,
the
problem
that
i
have
with
that
is
not
a
theoretical
problem,
but
kind
of
a
practical
one,
and
that
is
this,
that
if
we
require
a
demonstration
of
strickland
prejudice
at
the
habeas
stage,
once
there's
been
found
to
be
an
anders
violation,
if
we
require
the
demonstration
of
strickland
prejudice
at
that
stage,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
require
the
argument
of
the
appeal
in
the
first
instance
in
a
federal
court.
and
number
1,
that's
going
to
take
some
serious
time,
and
the
oddity...
when
you
get
to
standing
on
head
argument,
the
oddity
is
that
you're
going
to
have
your
appeal
argued
in
the
first
instance
in
a
federal
court,
whereas
in
the
first
instance
it
shouldn't
be,
so
for
pragmatic
reasons
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
an
argument
that
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
say
that
once
you
have
shown
the
anders
violation,
and
let's
say,
to
go...
i'd
go
this
far
for
the
sake
of
argument.
once
you've
shown
that
there's
a
possibility
that
there
could
be
a
difference,
that
there
might
be
some
merit,
that's
as
much
as
you
should
require,
or
in
effect
you're
going
to
turn
federal
courts
in
habeas
cases
on
anders
into
state
appellate
courts.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
believe
as
a
general
proposition
that,
if
this
court
identifies
a
constitutional
violation,
and
says
the
way
this
violation
is
to
be
avoided
in
the
future
is
to
follow
steps
a,
b,
and
c,
that
any
court,
state
or
federal
for
that
matter,
is
free
to
say,
well,
we
really
don't
like
a,
b,
and
c,
we'll
try
c,
d,
and
f?
do
you
believe
that
the
lower
courts
are
free,
when
we
have
come
up
with
a
pragmatic
constitutional
solution
and
says,
this
is
the
way
it
is
to
be
avoided,
are
they
free
to
ignore
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
is
mandatory,
what's
your
answer
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
takes
a
lot
of
courage,
but
one
countervailing
consideration,
i
take
it
as
a
general
matter,
the
enormous
workloads
that
the
assigned
counsel
are
laboring
under,
and
that
seems
to
me
one
of
the
distinctions
that
goes
to
the
analogy
you
tried
to
draw
between
the
situation
of
normally
retained
paid
counsel
and
the
counsel
who
are
subject
to
anders.
i
mean,
am
i
missing
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
tell
me,
then.
your
expression
tells
me
i
am...
justice
david
h.
souter
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm
not
sure
where
i
have
done
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
except
that
if
they're
normally
retained
counsel,
number
1
they
don't
have
an
inducement
to
give
short
shrift
to
issues
which
they
could
litigate
and
be
paid
for
litigating,
and
number
2,
i
had
supposed
that
as
a
group
they
were
more
likely
to
be
able
to
control
their
own
work
loads
and
not
take
more
than
they
could
handle.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
he
would
say,
this
is
as
close
as
i
can
get
to
a
nonfrivolous
issue.
isn't
that
what
he's
doing?
it's
a
kind
of
modified
issue-spotting.
this
is
as
close
as
the
record
gets
to
a
nonfrivolous
issue.
that's
what
he's
supposed
to
list,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
will
get
the
court
there
faster
than
the
court
will
get
if
it
has
to
do
it
all
by
itself.
