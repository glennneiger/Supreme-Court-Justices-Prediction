justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
does
the
appellate...
does
the
counsel
for
the
appellate
project
continue
to
participate
at
that
point,
or
does
he
stand
aside,
just
as
the
attorney
stood
aside?
in
other
words,
the
retained
attorney
consults
the
lawyer
for
the
california
appellate
project,
and
that
lawyer
concurs
with
the
judgment
that
there
should
be
a
wende
brief.
is
that
appellate
project
lawyer
now
out
of
the
process,
or
does
he
continue
to
assist
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us...
take
us
through,
because
i
want
to
get
to
justice
breyer's
question
again,
after
the
wende
brief
is
filed,
then
i
take
it
that
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
a
staff
that
looks
at
this
brief
and
talks
with
the
court
about
it,
is
that
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now...
now,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
that's
an
interesting
system.
it's
not
really
the
adversary
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
the
same
question.
these
are
very
distinguished
judges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they
just
disagree
as
a
matter
of
policy,
or
are
they
making
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
lawyer
in
anders,
in
the
anders
procedure,
need
not
follow
the
final
step
outlined
by
justice
breyer,
which
is
to
say
why
these
arguments
are
frivolous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
can
say,
i
hereby
certify
that
the
following
issues
should
be
examined
pursuant
to
anders,
and
then
list
these
things.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
point,
justice
stevens
and
i
were
both
interested
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
retired
justices.
do
you
interpret
this
brief
as
saying
that
there
is
a
constitutional
deficiency
in
the
california
procedure,
or
that
they
just
prefer
the
old
procedure
as
a
policy
matter?
how
do
you
interpret
the
brief?
