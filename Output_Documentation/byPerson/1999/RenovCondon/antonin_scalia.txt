mr.
waxman,
this
case
differs,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
airport
cases
you're
talking
about
and
from
the
pollution
emission
example
you
alluded
to
earlier,
in
that
the
collection
and
retention
of
data
regarding
automobile
licensing
is
distinctively
a
governmental
function.
you're
talking
about
distinctively
governmental
records.
it's
not
something
that...
you
know,
any
commercial
actor
can
pollute.
any
person
could,
although
it
may
not
be
that
they
have,
run
an
airport,
but
only
states
collect
information,
which
is
why
the
legislation
in
question
applies
only
to
states,
because
it's...
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
purely
governmental...
now,
maybe
this
is
a
garcia-type
concern
i'm
raising,
but
i
think
that
is
really
what
is...
justice
antonin
scalia
troubling
me
about
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
answered
that
argument
in
the
printz
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
waxman,
your...
the
connection
with
commerce
that
you
rely
on
here
is,
as
you
stated
at
the
outset,
simply
the
fact
that
information,
these
lists,
once
they
are
released,
are
an
article
of
commerce,
and
i
suppose
that
would
apply
to
any
information
possessed
by
a
state,
so
the
government
could
also...
the
federal
government
could
also
regulate
the
state's
use
of
its
tax
information
and
any
other
state
records,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
the
federal
government
has
a
change
of
heart,
and
it...
which
it
does.
i
mean,
10,
20
years
from
now,
they
say
the
problem
is
not
excessive
dissemination
of
information,
the
problem
is,
not
enough
dissemination
of
information,
and
we
think
all
the
states
should
have
a
freedom
of
information
act,
just
like
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
pass
such
a
law,
that
any
information
in
the
states'
records
have
to
be
released?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
obstacle,
effect
on
commerce.
if
there
is
a...
justice
antonin
scalia
substantial
effect
on
commerce,
to
the
extent
there
is,
the
federal
government
could
require
all
of
the
states
to
make
available
whatever
is
in
their
files
to
the
public?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
the...
what
the
state
administrators
desire
is
not
always
what
the
state
government
desires,
or
what
the
state
voters,
much
less
what
the
state
voters
desire.
i
mean,
you
have
to
assume
that
if
the
states
do
not
have
this
restrictive
policy
that
is
imposed
on
them
by
the
federal
government,
those
states
that
don't
have
it
don't
want
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
waxman,
you
know,
you
mentioned
the
three
separate
heads
that
could
overcome
the
federal
government's
authority
to
control
activities,
printz
and
so
forth.
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
fourth,
or
maybe
it's...
maybe
it
comes...
falls
under
one
or
the
other,
and
that
is,
a
state's
records
and
what
a
state
does
with
its
records
are
very
much
its
own
business?
i
mean,
you
know,
the
issue
of
transparency
of
government
is
a
major
concern,
and
each
government
should
know
just...
should
be
able
to
determine
just
how
transparent
its
own
operations
will
be.
these
are
state
records,
and
some
states
have
decided
we
want
transparency.
justice
antonin
scalia
anybody
can
look
to
see
who's
getting
licensed
and
who
isn't
getting
licensed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
saying
it
ought
to
be
stronger.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
pressed
into
service,
that
made
sense
to
speak
that
way
in
printz,
because
the
state
was
being
forced
to
act
as
a
government
in
order
to
implement
a
federal
regulatory
program.
your
state
is
no
more
being
pressed
into
federal
service
than
any
private
organization
which
has
records
that
comes
under
a
similar
prohibition
from
the
federal
government
is,
quote,
pressed
into
federal
service
and,
of
course,
you
can't
press
private
individuals
into
federal
service
any
more
than
you
can
states.
i
mean,
we
do
have
a
thirteenth
amendment,
after
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
onerous,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they're
being
pressed
into
service.
they're
not
implementing
any
federal
program.
they're
just
saying...
what
it
says
is,
you
can't
allow
this
information
to
be
disseminated,
just
as
it
tells
some
private
corporations
that
they
can't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
commerce
clause
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
might
need
to.
well,
there's...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
basically...
i
don't
see
how
they're
commandeered
at
all,
come
to
think
of
it.
i
mean,
all
they've
told
you
is,
don't
give
out
information.
why
is
that
hard
to
comply
with?
i
mean,
if
a
state
didn't
want
to
go
through
a
hassle,
all
it
would
have
to
say
is,
nobody
can
get
any
information
from
our
driver's
records,
period.
what's
to
commandeer?
what's
the
big
burden?
if
you
choose
to
give
out
some
of
it,
that's
your
problem.
in
figuring
out
the
details
of
what
we're
going
to
give
out,
make
sure
that
whatever
we
do
give
out
doesn't
run
afoul
of
federal
law,
but
federal
law
doesn't
require
you
affirmatively
to
do
anything.
all
you
have
to
do
is
sit
on
your
hands
and
not
give
away
any
driver's
information.
big
deal.
what's
so
hard
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
choice.
that's
not
the
government
commandeering
you
to
make
all
these
hard
decisions.
it's
because
you
choose
to
make
some
of
it
available
that
as
a
matter
of
state
function
you
say,
well,
if
the
state's
going
to
do
what
it
wants
to
do,
we're
going
to
have
to
make
sure
that
it
doesn't
run
afoul
of
the
federal
act,
but
that's
your
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
distinguish
the
wage
and
hour
laws
and
a
lot
of
other
examples
if
you
made
the
argument
that
there
is
something
distinctive
about
state
records,
and
that
the
federal
government,
this
is
just
a
category
which
the
federal
government
can't
control,
that
just
as
it
can't
tell
a
state
where
to
have
its
statehouse,
it
can't
tell
a
state
what
to
do
with
it's
governmental
records,
how
that...
you
know,
that's
an
argument.
that
may
be
right
or
wrong,
but
at
least
it
would
be
compatible
with
your
acknowledging
the
validity
of
these
other
statutes.
they
don't
deal
with
state
records.
state
records
are...
i
don't
know,
they're
sacred,
just
as
a
statehouse
is.
they
belong
to
the
state,
and
the
federal
government
mucking
around
with
them
goes
over
the
edge.
i
mean,
i...
that's
a
conceivable
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
if
anybody's
hurt
by
south
carolina's
being
more
liberal
with
its
disposition
of
its
driver's
records
than
other
states
are...
other
states
may
indeed
follow
the
federal
practice
under
their
own
state
law,
but
i
suppose
if
california
is
more
liberal,
if
you
call
it
liberal,
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody
but
south
carolinians,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
nobody
outside
of
south
carolinians
who
would
have
their
driver's
information
coughed
up
by
south
carolina.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
people
of
the
state
whose
driver's
license
are
at
issue.
