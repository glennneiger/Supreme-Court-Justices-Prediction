justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wouldn't
a
closer
case...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
true
of
every
federal
prohibition
on
what
a
state
government
does?
i
mean,
suppose
you
sell
hot
dogs
at
the
state
park.
don't
you
have
to
comply
with
the
food
and
drug
laws?
i
mean,
and
they
may
be
complicated,
and
you
may
have
to
say
what
kind
of
a
hot
dog
and
what
kind
of
a
stand,
and
what
about...
it's
certainly
a
lot
better
than
the
minimum
wage,
or
the...
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
have
to
do
a
lot
less
than
that.
and...
in
other
words,
is
your
argument
on
this
part
just
going
to
set
aside
all
federal
regulatory
programs
that
tell
states
what
they
can't
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
theory
is...
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
that
because
that
statute
that
she
mentioned
tells
only
states
what
they
can
or
can't
do,
it
doesn't
apply
to
private
people,
that
for
that
reason...
it
says,
state,
you
can't
tax.
for
that
reason,
it
would
likely...
i'm
not
holding
you
to
this,
but
i
mean,
your
instant
reaction
is,
that's
just
as
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
raises
concerns...
i
take
it
you're
not
attacking
all
of
this
court's
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
are
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
not,
then
i
would
think...
and
think
of
all
those
cases.
each
one
of
them,
a
judge
has
said
to
a
state,
you,
as
a
state,
cannot
do
something.
now,
suppose
congress
said
exactly
what
courts
have
said,
and
they
said
it
in
statutes.
in
each
of
those
statutes
congress
would
have
said
to
a
state,
as
a
state,
you
cannot,
you
cannot
run
your
airport
and
keep
egypt
air
out.
you
cannot
sell
natural
gas
and
keep
algerian
gas
out.
i
mean,
you
can't
regulate
it.
you
can't
regulate
your
electricity
and
keep
canadian
electricity
out.
you
can't,
you
can't,
you
can't.
and
if
you
accept
that
jurisprudence,
but
you're
also
arguing
you
can't
regulate
the
state
as
a
state,
how
do
you
do
that?
how
do
i...
how
would
i
possibly
find
for
you
on
your
theory
you
can't
regulate
a
state
as
a
state,
and
not
set
aside
the
entire
dormant
commerce
clause
and
dozens
of
statutes,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
national
security.
i
mean,
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
talking
about
the
entire
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
i'm
talking
about
any
kind
of
a
congressional
statute
aimed
at
a
state
which
would
say,
state,
you
can't
tax
this,
state,
you
can't
tax
that,
and
i
have
10
examples
if
you
want
me
to
give
them.
state,
you
cannot
keep
out
algerian
natural
gas.
state,
you
cannot...
those
don't
apply
to
private
people.
they
apply
to
states,
and
they
say
to
a
state,
state,
you
cannot.
now,
are
you
asking
us
to
set
aside
all
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
lots
of
examples.
i
mean,
i
can
give
you
10
statutes
where
congress
says
to
a
state,
you
can't
tax
airplanes,
you
can't
tax
cars,
you
can't
tax
electricity,
you
can't
tax
this,
you
can't
tax
that.
i'm
familiar
with
the
regulatory
area,
where
maybe
it
isn't
congress,
but
it's
federal
regulatory
agencies
that
say,
when
you
regulate
natural
gas
distribution
systems,
you
cannot
discriminate
in
your
rules
against
algerian
lng.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
discriminate...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it
more
of
a
regulation
of
the
state
here
to
say,
state,
you
may
not
release
this
information
to
a
private
person
than
to
say,
state
electricity
regulator,
you
may
not
discriminate
in
your
rules
against
electricity
coming
from
canada?
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
difference?
why
is
one
regulation...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
state
as
a
state,
and
the
other
not?
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't
one.
i'm
just
saying
i
don't
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
ask
justice
kennedy
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
