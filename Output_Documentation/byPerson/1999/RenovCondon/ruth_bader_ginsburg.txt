what
is
the
sanction,
then,
in
the
appropriations...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
waxman,
may
i
just
clarify
one
point?
with
respect
to
the
liberty
interest
that's
supposed
to
be
protected
by
the
dual
sovereignty,
as
i
understand
the
federal
legislation,
it
gives
the
choice
to
the
driver,
so
the
driver
who
wants
his
name
available
to
solicitors
or
anyone
can
just
say,
yeah,
okay,
give
my
name.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
the
citizen
could
be
regulated,
and
really
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
what
you
said
was,
the
federal
government
can
act
on
the
citizens,
so
it
would
be
permissible
for
congress
to
pass
a
law
that
says
no
person,
no
private
person
shall
request
driver's
license
information.
if
any
private
person
does,
they
commit
a
federal
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
this
case
in
part,
because
one
part
of
this
statute
does
require
the
states
to
provide
certain
information.
all
of
the
federal
statutes...
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
case
that
justice
stevens
has
raised.
several
federal
statutes
require
the
states
to
supply
information
to
various
enforcement
agencies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
condon,
i
find
such
difficulty
with
your
commandeering
burden
argument
when
i
think
of
the
legislation
you're
not
challenging,
at
least
here,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
surface
mining
act.
lots
of
environmental
legislation
poses
very
heavy
burdens
on
the
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
say
that
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
requires
you
to
turn
over
records,
that
that
would
fall
under
your
principle,
too,
but
as
a
matter
of
comity
you're
not
objecting,
or
that
that's
distinguishable
when
the
federal
government
says,
south
carolina,
you
will
give
your
driver's
license
information
to
certain
federal
agencies
for
certain
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
if
you
wanted
to
insist
on
that
being
unconstitutional,
you
can
say
they're
our
records,
and
we
don't
have
to
give
them
to
anybody.
