mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
live
in
an
age
in
which
data
bases
of
personal
information
are
widely
used
in
the
national
economy.
they
are
bought
and
sold,
and
they're
critical
to
national
marketing,
yet
their
dissemination
threatens
personal
privacy
and
sometimes
safety.
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act
is
one
of
a
series
of
laws
in
which
congress
has
balanced
the
benefits
to
commerce
of
disseminating
personal
information
against
the
costs
of
that
dissemination
to
personal
security.
beginning
with
the
privacy
act
and
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
in
the
early
1970's,
up
until
the
financial
services
act
that
was
enacted
just
last
week,
congress
has
acted
on
a
sector
by
sector
basis
as
new
uses
of
personal
data
and
new
threats
emerge.
in
this
case,
congress
heard
testimony
that,
while
motor
vehicle
data
bases
are
of
particular
value
in
commerce,
their
dissemination
poses
unique
risks
to
personal
safety
and
privacy.
once
disseminated,
motor
vehicle
data
bases
are
things
in
commerce,
just
as
surely
as
are
data
bases
that
belong
to
financial
institutions,
cable
operators,
health
care
providers,
and
congress
may
therefore
regulate
a
state's
discharge
of
data
into
the
national
economy
just
as
it
restricts
a
state
discharge
of
pollutants
or
other
state
activities
that
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
like
operating
airports,
or
issuing
municipal
bonds.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
correct.
we
have
not
sought
this
court's
review
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
question.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
justice
o'connor,
that
there
are
few
examples
of
congress'
attempt
to
regulate
states
alone
directly,
as
actors
as
opposed
to
the
traditional
preemption
doctrine,
because
ordinarily
what
states
do
in
interstate
commerce
is
similar
to
what
other
people
do,
and
in
this
case
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
this
act,
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
is
one
of
a
series
of
laws
that
stretches
from
the
1970's
until
last
week,
in
which
of
necessity
congress
has
been
dealing
with
this
kind
of
evolving
information
age
on
a
sector-by-sector
basis.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
the
best
example
that
i've
come
up
with,
and
it's
in
our
brief,
is,
for
example,
the
regulation
of
the
operation
of
commercial
airports.
all
commercial
airports
are...
i
believe
they
are
all
operated
by
state
or
municipal
entities,
and
yet
congress
has
the
authority
and
has
given
the
faa
the
authority
to
say...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
i
think
commercial
air...
this
was
actually
a
subject
of
debate
in
the
oral
argument
in
travis,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
believe
we
went
back
and
checked.
there
are
lots
of
private
airports,
but
commercial
airports
that
take
commercial
airliners
are
something
that
are
specially
regulated
by
congress
and
the
faa.
they're
operated
only
by
state
and
municipal
entities,
and
congress
can
say,
you
can't
have
a
runway
shorter
than
7,000
feet.
similar...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
with
respect...
preemption,
of
course,
we're
not
arguing
that
this
is
a
preemption
case.
in
our
view,
this
is
a
case
that
is
stronger
for
the
government
than
preemption,
but
the
principle
that
when
states
act
in
interstate
commerce,
when
they
attempt
to
regulate
an
instrumentality
or
a
thing
in
commerce,
or
they
engage
in
an
activity
that
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce,
congress
has
the
authority
to
direct
or
limit
their
activities
just
as
it
does
with
respect
to
anyone
else.
if
one
or
more
states
in
this...
with
the
example
of
this
statute
decided
to
contract
out
their
motor
vehicle
data
base
function
to
eds
or
some
other
information
services
company,
it
can't
make
a
constitutional
difference
if
one
commercial
airport
decide...
you
know,
becomes
privately
operated,
and
in
this
case,
the
act...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
it
is,
but
let
me
address
your
concern,
justice
scalia,
as
best
i
can.
first
of
all,
the
act
applies
not
only
to
states,
but
also
to
contractors
and
people
who
receive
the
information
from
the
state.
it
acts
on
the
data
base.
and
the
critical
point
i
want
to
make
in
response
to
your
question
is,
the...
although
i
think
congress
could
take
over
licensing
and
motor
vehicle
permit
issuances,
congress
has
not
attempted
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
state's
ability
to
issue
licenses,
issue
motor
vehicle
registrations,
to
regulate
how
those
laws
are
administered
or
enforced.
it...
this
act
takes
effect
only
when
data
is
released
into
the
national
economy.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
with
all
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't...
i
think
this
is
baker
and
fry
and
not
printz,
because
the
federal
legislation
is
not
using
state
employees
or
state
governments
to
regulate
third
parties,
or
to
act
on
its
behalf.
in
printz,
as
this
court
explained,
as
in
new
york...
and
i
think
this
is
very...
it's
certainly
important
to
our
case.
what
this
court
said
is,
you
cannot...
the
congress
can't
use
its
sovereignty
to
govern
private
conduct
through
another
sovereign.
it
can't
require
states
to
legislate
a
solution
to
a
problem
that
congress
has...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
certainly
true.
it
is
just
as
true
as
it
was
in
fry
with
respect
to
wage
controls,
in
baker
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
bonds,
in
garcia
with
respect
to
wage
rates
and
employment
laws,
and
in...
with
respect
to
the
pollution
laws.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
congress
requires
the
states
to
do
or
prohibits
them
from
doing
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce
that
requires
that
they
do
things.
in
baker,
this
court
said
that
a
state
wishing
to
engage
in
certain
activity
must
take
administrative
and
sometimes
legislative
action
to
comply
with
federal
standards
regulating
that
activity
is
a
commonplace
that
presents
no
constitutional
defect.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
first
of
all
there
would
have
to
be
a
showing
with
respect
to
the
particular
type
of
information
that
was
being
regulated,
that
it
did...
that
its
dissemination
did,
in
fact,
have
what
this
court
has
reiterated
to
be
a
substantial
effect
in
interstate
commerce,
a
point
that's
not
contested
here.
and
i
think...
and
i
would
concede
to
you
that
we
would
have
a
different
case
if
the
federal
government
were
trying
to
do
something
that
the
principle
articulated
in
coyle,
and
recognized
in
garcia
and
baker,
were
to
apply.
if
the
federal
government
prohibited
the
state
from
issuing
to
the
public
information
about
how
it
operates,
if
it
interfered
with
the
state's
ability
to
structure
its
fundamental
mechanisms
of
self-government,
but
this...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
again...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't...
i
think
that
would
be
very...
i
mean,
if
it
were
truly
anything,
it
would
be
very
problematic,
and
it
might
not
be
defensible
under
coyle.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
would
also
require,
i
think,
either
express
findings,
or
it
to
be
obvious
to
this
court's,
quote,
naked
eye
that
that
law
had,
or
the
release
of
that
information
had
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
here,
it's
conceded,
there's
no
question
that
it
does,
and
not
only
are
these
data
bases...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
as
we
understand
this
court's
jurisprudence,
the
tenth
amendment
has
three,
if
you
will,
independent
heads
of
authority.
the
first
is
the
principle
expressed
in
coyle
and
reiterated
in
garcia
and
baker
that
i
just
talked
about.
there
is
an
area
of
the
state's
ability
to
structure
its
mechanisms
of
self-government
that
the
federal
government
simply
is
powerless
to
affect.
that's
number
1.
you
can't
tell
them
they
can't
move
their
state
capital,
or
they
can't
have
a
police
force,
or
they
have
to
have
a
commission
that
has
11
and
not
12
people
on
it,
or
maybe
even
that
they
have
to
reveal
information
that
it
is
essential
to
the
state's
function
not
to
reveal.
that's
head
number
1.
head
number
2
is
the
principle
that
the
court
articulated
in...
well,
in
garcia,
in
which
the
protection
of
the
states
is
largely
left
to
the
national
legislative
process,
but
there
may
be
procedural
defects
in
which
one
or
a
few
states
are
subject
to
an
undue
burden
or
discrimination
by
reason
of
some
defect
in
the
legislative
process.
and
the
third,
of
course,
is
reflected
in
the
anticommandeering
principle
that
this
court
has
articulated
in
the
legislative
context
in
new
york,
and
in
the
executive
context
in
printz,
and
if
any
one
of
those...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right,
chief
justice,
and
i
think
with
respect
to
those
three
heads
of
authority
they
all...
they
wouldn't
even
come
into
play
unless
the
court
were
to
find,
or
congress
were
to
find
that
it
were
acting
under
one
of
its
enumerated
powers.
i
mean,
if
it's
not
acting
under
an
enumerated
power,
the
tenth
circuit
prohibits
it
by
its
very
terms,
because
that
power
is
reserved.
these
three
independent
constraints
that
the
court
has
articulated
over
the
years
apply
even
if
there
is
a
finding
that
the
congress
is
exercising
a
legitimate
authority
in
interstate
commerce.
in
this
case,
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
this
data
base
were
being
in
fact
a
data
base
from
a
financial
institution,
or
a
health
care
provider,
or
a
video
store,
all
of
which
congress
has
separately
regulated,
there
would
be
no
question
that
congress
would
have
authority
to
regulate
or
limit
the
dissemination
so
long
as
there
was
some
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
so
we
get
to
the
tenth
amendment
question
in
this
case,
because
congress
is
concededly
operating
to
regulate
something,
an
article
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
question
is
whether
this
law,
unlike
the
law
in
printz
or
in
coyle,
violates
some
independent
prohibition
of
the
tenth
amendment,
and
justice
kennedy...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
i
would...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
kennedy...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i'd
like
to
make
two
points.
actually,
i
originally
had
three,
but
i've
now
forgotten
the
third.
[laughter]
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
with
respect
to
this.
first
of
all,
the
information
that
is
being
restricted
here
is
not
information
about
how
the
government
works,
or
how
the
government
structures
its
operations,
the
type
of
information
that
this
court
was
concerned
with
in
reporter's
committee,
and
that
would
pose
a
different
problem.
but
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
same
point...
that
is,
well,
you
know,
if
the
people
of
south
carolina
want
more
protection
for
their
privacy,
they
can
vote,
you
know,
they
can
elect,
i
don't
know,
a
different
attorney...
they'd
never
find
a
better
attorney
general...
but
they
could
elect
a
different
attorney
general,
or
they
can
move.
they
could
move
to
north
carolina,
or
some
state
that
has
a
protection
that's
even
stronger
than
the
national
legislature.
but
the
same
could
be
said
with
respect
to
the
child
labor
laws,
the
surface
mining
laws
that
were
at
issue
in
hodel...
the
people
of
south
carolina
are,
of
course,
also
citizens
of
the
united
states,
and
they
have
the
right
to
call
upon
either
government
for
the
protection
of
their
liberties.
that,
after
all,
was
the
point
i
think
that
you
made
about
the
double
protection
of
liberty
in
the
compound
republic.
and
what's
particularly
significant
here
is
that
congress
was
asked,
in
testimony
by
the
association
of
state
motor
vehicle
operators,
expressly
to
enact
a
law
that,
quote,
must
apply
uniformly
on
a
national
basis
because
of
the
ubiquity
of
this
information
and
the
ease
of
accessing
this
information
on
computer
modems
from
anywhere
in
the
world.
the
stalker
who
killed
rebecca
schaefer
could
just
as
easily
have
come
from
nevada
or
utah
as
from
california,
where
she
lived,
and
that's...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
when
the
states
ask
for
something,
that
makes
it
constitutional.
in
new
york,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
if
all
50
states
agree
with
the
federal
government
that
it
can
do
something
that
violates
an
independent
prohibition
of
the
constitution,
it
still
adds
up
to
nothing.
but
with
respect
to
legislation
that
congress
is
empowered
to
enact,
the
fact
that
congress
was
responding
to
the
state
motor
vehicle
administrators
who
were
asking
for
a
national
uniform
law,
it
seems
to
me
does
have
some
significance
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
congress'
authority.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
make
that
assumption
at
all.
there's
now
a
federal
law
in
which
all...
i
think
every
state
except
for
four
are
fully
complying
with.
some
states
have
enacted
laws
that
are
even
more
restrictive
of
the
transfer
of
information,
and
this
act
doesn't
in
any
way
preempt
the
operation
of
those
laws,
except
with
respect
to
the
information
that
independent
federal
statutes
congress
has
required
the
states
to
report,
which
is,
of
course,
an
issue
that
this
court
reserved
in
printz.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
actually,
one
of
the...
justice
o'connor,
we
did
the
best
we
could
in
our
supplemental
brief
to
explain
the
operation
of
this
provision
of
the
department
of
transportation
appropriations
act.
one
of
the
unusual
things
about
it
is
that
it
includes
a
provision
that
if
states
don't
comply
they
will
not
lose
any
funding,
although
it
does
also
purport
to
apply
congress'
spending
clause
authority
to
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
there
is...
i
mean,
there
is
no...
the
appropriations
law,
which
of
course
is
1-year
legislation
in
any
event,
doesn't
include
a
sanction,
but
it
incorporates
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
which
itself
has
sanctions.
and
presumably
also
we
think,
if
a
state
took
the
money...
and
the
law
does
not
even
apply
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
until
after
this
court
issues,
quote,
a
final
decision
in
reno
v.
condon...
we
think
that
the
federal
government
could,
if,
contrary
to
an
assumption
that
we
have
to
make,
which
is
that
the
states
would
comply,
it
didn't,
we
could
presumably
seek
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief.
but
we
did
indicate
to
the
court
in
our
supplemental
brief
that
this
intervening
legislation
does
lend
somewhat
of
an
academic
tone
to
this
discussion,
but
it
doesn't
moot
the
case,
and
it
doesn't
really
change
any
of
the
substantive
issues
in
the
case,
because
the
law
doesn't
apply
to
south
carolina,
presumably
because
the
court
was
attempting
to
respect,
or
the
congress
was
attempting
to
respect
this
court's
decisional
processes.
but
more
to
the
point,
when
this
legislation
sunsets,
there
still
will
be
a
substantive
law
enacted
under
congress'
commerce
clause
authority,
so...
well,
it...
yes,
it
does
have
a
somewhat
academic...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
if
the...
if...
it
may
very
well
apply.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
been
unable
to
discern
anything
in
the
constitutional
structure
that
would
require
a
result
as
bizarre
as
saying
to
congress,
if
you
want
to
regulate
the
dissemination
in
interstate
commerce
of
the
motor
vehicle
data
base,
you
have
to
do
so
in
the
same
law
and
in
the
same
way
as
all
of
the
other
data
bases
that
are
in
interstate
commerce
that
you've
heard
have
different
promise
and
pose
different
problems.
after
all,
article
i,
it
authorizes
congress
within
its
enumerated
powers
to
enact
laws
that
are
necessary
and
proper,
which
must
include
in
it
the
prerogative
that
all
legislatures
have
to
tailor
their
laws
to
the
problems
at
hand.
and
the
tenth...
for
purposes
of
the
tenth
amendment,
if
a
particular
state
activity
affecting
commerce
is
within
reach
of
the
national
legislature,
if
it
also
applies
to
some
private
parties,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
power
to
address
that
activity
by
the
state
necessarily
does
lie
within
the
powers,
quote,
delegated
to
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
tenth
amendment.
congress'
power
doesn't
depend
on
whether
the
act
also
applies
to
private
parties.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it's
even
more
solicitous
of
the
state
motor
vehicle
operators,
because
it
allows
them
to
disseminate
it
for
any
purpose,
provided
that
they
have
in
place
a
system...
and
this
is
reflected
in
section
(b)(11)
of
2721,
provided
that
they
have
a
system
that
permits
people
to,
quote,
opt
out
of
the
legislation,
so
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
state,
any
state
that
puts
in
place
a
system
that
allows
people
to
just
check
off
if
they
want
to
opt
out
can
otherwise
sell
this
data
base
as
they
have
before.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
scalia,
i...
this
may
be
repeating
myself,
but
maybe
i
didn't
make
my
point
clear.
i
think
that
that,
in
certain
contexts
that
exception,
that
instance
would
be
covered
by
the
coyle
head.
that
is,
if
you...
if
the
federal
government
were
purporting
to
restrict
the
state
from
making
available
information
to
tell
its
citizens
about
what
it's
doing,
how
it's
operating,
that
would
be
a
case
that's
very
different
than
an
act
which
comes
in
only
at
the
point
at
which
a
state
puts
into
interstate
commerce
information
that
private
citizens,
personal
information
that
private
citizens
provide
to
it.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
i
think
that
was
most
striking
in
the
testimony
before
congress
was
the
testimony
about
how
vulnerable
people
become
when
this
information
is
available,
because
the
ability
to
tie
your
address
and
your
photograph
to
a
license
plate
is
the
equivalent,
in
terms
of
personal
safety,
to
being
required
to
walk
around
all
day
with
a
sign
that
says,
my
name
is
seth
waxman,
and
i
live
at
this
address,
and
i'm
this
age,
and
i
have
these
medical
disabilities.
it's
a
unique
aspect
of
information
that
says
nothing
about...
tells
the
government,
the
people
nothing
about
how
the
states
are
operating.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
three
points
in
my
3
minutes,
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
usery-garcia
point,
judge
easterbrook,
writing
the
majority
opinion
in
travis,
which
is
the
companion
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
found
correctly,
we
think,
and
for
the
reasons
we
articulate
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
8,
footnote
6,
that
this
case,
in
any
event,
wouldn't
be
decided
differently
even
under
the
regime
in
usery.
and
i
commend
the
court's
attention
to
judge
easterbrook's
majority
opinion
and
our
analysis,
which
essentially
takes
off
from
the
chief
justice's
concurrence
in
south
carolina
v.
baker,
where
the
chief
justice
emphasized
that
the
more
expansive
conception
of
the
tenth
amendment
espoused
in
usery
recognized
that
congressional
action
that,
quote,
operates
to
displace
the
state's
freedom
to
structure
integral
operations
in
areas
of
traditional
government
functions
runs
afoul
of
the
authority
granted
by
congress.
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
where
there
was
a
bar
on
releasing
any
information
that
is
in
a
state
record,
probably
would
raise
very
serious
concerns
under
usery,
but
a
release
in
commerce
on
information
that
is
personal
and
private
that
is
provided
by
citizens
we
think
doesn't
implicate
usery.
with
respect
to
the...
justice
kennedy's
point
and
justice
stevens
point
about
the
category
of
one,
i...
if
one
looks
at
the
environmental
laws,
for
example,
that
congress
has
regulated
sludge
and
solid
waste
systems
that
are
operated,
if
not
exclusively,
overwhelmingly
by
municipalities,
and
congress...
and
it
has
regulated
in
a
way
that
is
different
than
it
regulates
other
types
of
environmental
issues,
and
the
fact
that
congress
distinguishes...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
if
it
doesn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
sure
like
to
take
another
shot
at
united
states
v.
printz,
which
involved
sheriffs
and...
[laughter]
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious.
we
have
understood
that
in
contrast
to
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
jurisdiction,
the
court
has
always
construed
its
tenth
amendment
jurisdiction
to
include
not
only
states
but
subordinate
sovereign
entities,
or
subordinate
governmental
entities.
i
just
want
to
point
out,
with
respect
to
south
carolina
v.
baker,
which
is
always
cited
as
a
statute
of
general
applicability,
and
perhaps
in
one
sense
correctly
so,
but
only
in
the
sense
that
this
is,
too,
the
section
that...
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
baker,
section
310(b)(1)
of
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act
applied
only
to
state
and
local
governments.
it
denied
a
tax
exemption
to
unregistered
bonds,
a
tax
exemption
that
only
applied
to...
ever
only
applied
to
state
and
local
governments.
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
that
this
was
part
of
a
general
system
of
law,
a
general
law
that
did
away
with...
it
tried
to
address
the
problem
of
tax
fraud
through
the
use
of
unregistered
bonds.
it
acted
with
respect
to
the
federal
government
in
a
different
way,
and
the
same
is
true
here.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you
very
much.
