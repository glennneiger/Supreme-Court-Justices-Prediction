what
about
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
justice
breyer's
questions?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying,
then,
that
garcia
was
wrong,
that
we
go
back
to
usery?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it's...
you
say...
you
keep
emphasizing
the
burden
and,
as
justice
breyer
suggested
a
moment
ago,
save
for
details,
i
don't
see
anything
distinguishable
between
this
burden
and
the
burden
of
the
wage
and
hour
law,
which
can
be
nightmarish
to
administer.
and
if
the
burden
is
in
fact
the...
going
to
be
the
criterion,
then
even
without
going
back
to
usery,
the
wage
and
hour
law
extension
to
the
states,
even
though
it
covers
private
individuals,
i
presume
is
unconstitutional,
too.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
burden,
then,
is...
the
so-called
burden
argument
i
assume,
then,
takes
you
nowhere.
that's
not
essential
to
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
but
i
don't
want
to
misunderstand
you.
the...
your
point,
i
take
it,
is
not
whether
the
burden
is
heavy
or
the
burden
is
light.
the
burden
is...
the
only
relevant
question
is
whether
acts
of
administration
are
required
on
the
part
of
the
states
in
order
to
comply
with
a
federal
statute.
is
that
the
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
wage
and
hour
law
goes,
because
the
states
certainly
have
to
take
many,
many
steps
to
administer
the
wage
and
hour
law
to
their
employees.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
that
the
wage
and
hour
law,
therefore,
has
got
to
be
struck
down
in
its
application
to
the
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
has
administrative
burdens,
so...
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
okay
if
they're
distributed
to
states
and
to
private
entities?
no
matter
what
the
administrative
burden,
it's
okay
as
long
as
private
entities
also
have
administrative
burdens?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
would
be
yes
or
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
truly,
if...
is
it
your
position
that
the
administrative
burdens
are
okay
if
the
same
statute
imposes
administrative
burdens
on
private
entities?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
all
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
your
core
is
state
functions,
then
you're
back
in
usery,
and
you
don't
need
the
burden
criteria.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
wage
and
hour
law
provides
the
same
confusion.
when
you
go
the
employee
and
say,
i'm
sorry,
you
can't
work
more
than
40
hours
because
you'd
be
subject
to
overtime
and
we're
not
going
to
pay
it,
the
employee
doesn't
know
whether
that
it's
the
state
government
that
doesn't
want
them
to
work,
or
whether
it's
because
the
national
government
requires
time
and
a
half.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
any
principle
distinction
between
the
statutes
which
you
are
disclaiming
any
effect
upon,
and
the
one
that
you
are
challenging,
because
in
each
of
them
there
is
going
to
be
uncertainty
in
the
minds
of
the
citizen
as
to
the
source
of
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
is
certainly...
this
statute
is
certainly
intended
to
be
part
of
the
national
fabric.
it
applies
to
all
the
states.
that's
about
as
national
as
you
can
get.
