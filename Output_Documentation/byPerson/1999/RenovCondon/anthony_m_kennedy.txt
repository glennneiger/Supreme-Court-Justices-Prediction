justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
o'connor's
question
points
up
a
reaction
i
had
in
reading
your
brief.
i
thought,
well,
i'm
going
to
find
some
cases
that
will
show
that
the
federal
government
can
do
this
occasionally.
i
can't
find
them.
and
on
page
35
you
say,
congress
may
directly
regulate
stated
activity
affecting
congress,
no
cite,
and
i
think
the
reason
is,
for
150
years
or
so
the
assumption
has
been
that
congress
cannot
regulate
states.
it
regulates
persons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
its
preemption
power,
sometimes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
printz
case,
you
made
the
same
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
allowing
the
states
to
regulate.
it's
much
better
than
if
the
federal
government
just
took
over
driver's
licensing,
or
took
over
weapons
regulations.
but
in
printz
we
said,
the
point
is,
we
want
to
make
clear
who
is
regulating,
is
it
the
federal
government,
or
is
it
the
states,
and
this
blurs
the
line,
and
this
you
may
not
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
one
of
the
fundamental
mechanisms
of
state
government
that
state
employees
and
state
officers
are
accountable
to
their
voters,
to
their
citizens
for
what
they
do,
and
this
completely
blurs
that
line?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fact,
suppose
you
have
a
state
which
is
so
insensitive
that
it's
selling
this
information
right
and
left,
by
the
federal
statute
you
make
it
unnecessary
to
the
state
voters
to
control
that
conduct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me...
and
just
to
finish
the
thought...
here
the
class
affected,
i.e.,
the
people
that
have
driver's
licenses,
is
congruent
almost
precisely
with
those
who
vote
and
control
their
state
officials.
federal
intervention
is
(a)
unneeded
and
(b)
intrusive
on
this
governmental
mechanism.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
the
government
right
when
it
says
that
is
still
different
from
printz,
because
in
printz
the
government
officials,
state
officials
were
being
pressed
into
service
to
direct,
regulate,
control
the
activities
of
their
own
citizens,
and
that
isn't
the
case
here.
do
you
agree
with
that
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
i
take
it
to
be
general
waxman's
point
that
in
arizona,
when
the
citizen
couldn't
buy
the
gun,
he
didn't
know
who
to
blame,
the
state
or
the
federal
government.
here,
there
is
no
operation,
as
i
understand
his
argument...
and
maybe
this
is...
maybe
you'd
disagree
with
it.
here,
there
is
no
operation
of
the
law
on
state
citizens
by
reason
of
anything
state
officials
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
answer
that
this
is
exactly
the
way
preemption
and
supremacy
power
should
work?
congress
has
the
ultimate
determination
over
which
branch
of
government
regulates
individual
entities,
but
that's
not
this
case,
because
here
congress
is
regulating
a
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
case,
is
that
we
go
from
commandeering
to
exclusive
state
function,
and
nothing
seems
quite
to
work,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
earlier.
now
you're...
what
you're
doing
is
saying
that
this
is
an
integral
state
function,
it's
an
inherently
governmental
function.
that's
different
from
commandeering.
