mr.
charles
condon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
protecting
privacy.
we
are
for
protecting
privacy,
and
this
case
is
not
about
preventing
the
horrible
crime
of
stalking.
we're
against
stalking.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
thousands
of
state
officials
across
the
country
can
be
pressed
into
federal
service
by
the
congress
to
administer
a
federal
regulatory
act.
i
think
if
i
could
answer
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
i
think
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case,
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act
is
complex,
it's
burdensome,
it
has
all
these
exceptions,
14
exceptions,
and
it
applies
only
to
the
states
of
the
united
states,
and
to
follow
this
federal
mandate,
which
is
unfunded,
by
the
way,
state
officials
must
first
look
at
it,
interpret
it,
and
then
apply
it
to
this...
mr.
charles
condon
the
overall...
mr.
charles
condon
that's
correct.
the
overall
tenor,
though,
is
to
the
state
officials.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
if
i
can
answer
both
of
those
questions,
it
is
possible
this
act
may
be
severable,
because
it
does...
and
we're
saying
that
the
congress
should
directly
regulate
individuals.
that's
our
position,
and
so
we
have
no
problem
with
the
direct
regulation
of
congress
by
individual
citizens.
but
as
to
your
comment
or
assertion
that
south
carolina
sells
this
information,
under
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
had
it
been
in
effect
in
south
carolina
when
south
carolina
sold
3.5
million
photographs...
this
is
my
point
about
how
the
act
is
ineffective...
that
selling
was
legal
under
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
because
the
same
sale
occurred
in
florida
and
colorado,
where
the
act
had
never
been
challenged
and
was
in
effect.
so
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
number
1,
doesn't
work.
but
that's
really
besides
the
point,
because...
mr.
charles
condon
no.
we're
saying
the
exact
opposite.
[laughter]
let
south
carolina
run
its
own
business
here.
mr.
charles
condon
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
the
practical
effects
of
this
law.
first
of
all,
a
state
dmv
employee
in
darlington,
south
carolina
who
knowingly
violates
this
act
faces
arrest,
a
criminal
fine,
presumably
by
the
fbi.
mr.
charles
condon
if
i
could
use
this
very
concrete
analogy.
when
citizens
want
to
come
into
this
courtroom
this
morning,
pursuant
to
directions
from
this
court,
the
marshal's
services
says,
you
can't
come
in.
now,
the
government's
position
is
that
only
the
marshal's
service
is
being
regulated.
our
position
is
that
the
citizen
is
being
regulated.
the
citizen
cannot
come
in
here,
and
so
a
prohibition
is,
indeed,
a
regulation.
mr.
charles
condon
we
would
not
object
to
that,
to
such
a
law.
in
fact,
that's
what
the
congress
should
do.
mr.
charles
condon
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
charles
condon
no.
look
at
sheriff
printz
of
montana,
what
he
had
to
do
in
the
printz
case.
the
brady
act
simply
required
sheriff
printz
to
run,
in
effect,
a
records
check,
a
rap
sheet,
so
sheriff
printz
had
to
get
the
name
and
the
social
security
number
from
the
brady
form,
period.
there
was
no
obligation
to
turn
that
back
over
to
the
gun
dealer,
no
obligation
to
give
it
to
the
federal
government.
here,
we've
got
to
tell
our
state
dmv
employees
that,
listen,
you've
got
this
really
complicated
law,
it's
got
these
14
exceptions,
who
knows
what
they
mean...
mr.
charles
condon
well,
i
want
to
get
back
to
my
original
point.
let's
say
you
get
your
car
towed
this
morning.
the
act
provides
that,
pursuant
to
a
car
being
towed,
you're
entitled...
there's
an
exception
there,
a
permissible
exception
that
the
state
records
can
then
be
released.
but
the
citizen
then
comes
in,
and
presumably
the
state
official
has
to
look
at
that
exception
and
develop
standards
and
develop
forms.
we
have
to
verify
if,
indeed,
this
is
the
correct
information
here,
you're
not
making
this
up
to
stalk
someone,
so
the
citizen
is
really
being
directly
regulated
by
us.
we're
being
puppets
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
charles
condon
justice
breyer,
that
again
is
a
good
question,
but
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
we
aren't
selling
hot
dogs
here.
mr.
charles
condon
that
could
raise...
mr.
charles
condon
that
could
raise
some
concerns,
if
the
congress
is
telling
the
states
that
pursuant
to
your
taxing
authority
we
take...
mr.
charles
condon
yes,
but...
mr.
charles
condon
it
would
raise
concerns.
mr.
charles
condon
no.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
national
security
implications
may
be
different,
but
if
i
can
get
back
to
your
hot
dog...
mr.
charles
condon
no.
mr.
charles
condon
i
understand.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
i
think
what's
telling
here
is
that
when
asked
of
the
solicitor
general,
is
there
one
case
that
tells
the
states
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
only
the
states,
you
can't
do
x,
y
or
z,
you
come
up
with
this
airport
example
that
justice
stevens
pointed...
mr.
charles
condon
well,
i'm
trying
to
answer
it,
but
to
answer
your
question,
if
you
look
at
the
garcia
line
of
cases,
and
the...
mr.
charles
condon
well...
mr.
charles
condon
yes,
i
heard...
mr.
charles
condon
well...
mr.
charles
condon
well...
mr.
charles
condon
when
you
look
at
the
jurisprudence
in
terms
of
preemption
and
other
enumerated
powers
within
the
constitution,
admittedly
it's
different
in
terms
of
where
we
are,
but
to
get
back
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
has
breathed
new
life
into
our
system
of
dual
sovereignty,
we
simply...
mr.
charles
condon
well,
you
know,
to
reference
this
point,
directly
regulating
individuals
is
a
different
matter
here,
and
when
you've
got
the
states
here...
and
again,
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
hot
dog,
because
i
like
that
one,
if
i
could,
we're
not
selling
hot
dogs
here.
when
the
car
first
came
through
south
carolina,
we
took
this
over.
this
is
what
we
do
in
terms
of
regulating
automobiles,
and
for
the
congress
to
come
along,
worried...
and
we're
responsive
to
our
citizens.
we
have
to
run...
mr.
charles
condon
yes.
well,
i
think
it's...
mr.
charles
condon
in
this
case
we
don't
need
to
revisit
those
issues.
that's
a
law
general...
mr.
charles
condon
if
you
look
at
printz,
and
just
really
keep
it
simple,
and
if
you've
got
some
questions
about
the
commandeering,
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
the
practicality
of
what's
going
on
here.
this
is
much
more
commandeering
than
what
the
sheriff...
mr.
charles
condon
no.
mr.
charles
condon
and
of
course,
the
balancing
is
not
necessary.
i...
as
printz
makes
clear...
mr.
charles
condon
i
think
it
takes
you
to
look
at
the
aspect
of
administering,
because
in
the
abstract
i
think
you
can
say,
well,
they're
not...
this
is
merely
a
prohibition.
but
to
get
back
to
my
concrete
example,
when
the
officer...
mr.
charles
condon
that's
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
as
this
court
has
said...
mr.
charles
condon
this
court
has
said
that
was
a
law
of
general
applicability.
mr.
charles
condon
and
my
point
about
administrative
burdens
is
to
get
to
the
heart...
mr.
charles
condon
again,
in
terms
of
trying
to
answer
your
question
directly...
mr.
charles
condon
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
charles
condon
well,
there
may
be
a
case
that
is
so...
and
i
can't
imagine
this
getting
through
the
congress,
but
it
might,
where
it's
so
broad
but
so
burdensome
it
would
get
to
the
core
of
our
state
functions.
that...
it
would
depend
upon
the
statute.
mr.
charles
condon
correct,
but...
mr.
charles
condon
ministerial
reporting,
i
know,
justice...
mr.
charles
condon
if
the
reporting
involved
a
lot
of
cost
and
expense
in
gathering
it,
i
think
that
would
raise
some
concerns.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
of
course,
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
that's
really
my
point.
mr.
charles
condon
that
also
is
a
good
question,
justice
ginsburg,
and
this
statute
does
codify
the
existing
statutes
that
require
some
reporting.
we've
not
made
that
the
core
challenge
of
this
case
because
of
this
administerial
reporting
aspect,
but
when
you
get
back
to
what's
going
on,
to
the
dmv
employee
in
south
carolina,
if
i
could,
they
are
being
commandeered
by
the
congress,
congress'...
mr.
charles
condon
the
administerial
reporting?
mr.
charles
condon
i
believe
that
in
terms
of
the
core
of
this
case,
it
could.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
could
i
rely
on
a
little
elbow
grease
at
the
joints
there,
in
terms
of
a
little
play?
i
mean,
the
governments
have
to
function
together,
and
reporting
missing
children
to
the
congress,
i
mean...
but
here,
the
congress
has
decided
that
privacy
is
the
issue
de
jour,
that
we're
going
to
tell
these
horrible
states...
mr.
charles
condon
the
commandeering.
they've
sent
no
money
with
this.
it's
very
complex.
it's
complicated...
mr.
charles
condon
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
reporting...
mr.
charles
condon
that
is
true.
i
agree
with
that.
if
there's
whole
new
aspects
in
terms
of
gathering
and
costs
and
things.
but
just
sitting
right
there,
and
the
congress
wants
to
require
the
states...
but
the
principle,
i
agree,
might
come
into
play,
but
again,
here
you've
got
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
that
can
assess
a
$5,000
a
day
fine
against
the
states
for
not
complying,
we
have
a...
mr.
charles
condon
well...
mr.
charles
condon
again,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
involved.
mr.
charles
condon
well,
in
terms
of...
again,
the
practical
effects,
in
terms
of
the
commandeering,
and
again,
this
isn't
information
that
it's
improper
for
us
to
have,
or
something
new,
or
that
the
flow
of
information
is
new.
people
need
to
have
this
information.
insurance
rates...
mr.
charles
condon
the
information
has
to
flow.
it's
essential
that...
mr.
charles
condon
well,
these
are
things
we
do.
rate-setting
with
insurance
companies,
they
have
to
know
who's
the
good
driver
and
the
bad
driver.
police,
in
terms
of
solving
crimes,
they
have
to
be
able
to
look
at
these
records
and
do
things,
and
to
simply
say,
well,
you
can
just
simply
stop
doing
your
business
and
doing
your
job,
i
think...
mr.
charles
condon
well,
garcia
and
baker,
that's
still
good
law,
and
again,
that's
not
here
before
this
court,
but
that's
not
what's
involved
in
this
case.
this
statute
only
applies
to
the
states,
and
it
only
applies
to
the
officials
in
those
states,
and
we
have
to
comply
with
this
statute
or
face
these
penalties,
which...
you
may
make
light
of
it,
but
i
don't
know
how
many
federal
statutes
that
are
out
there
that
can
have
someone
arrested
for
the
fbi
for
knowing
violation
of
simply
doing
their
job
day-in
and
day-out.
and
again,
in
terms
of
blurring
the
political
accountability,
getting
back
to
that,
these
are
records
that
south
carolina
law
requires
to
be
produced,
these
are
records
that
we
pay
tax
dollars
to
produce,
and
we're
just
simply
saying
that,
let
south
carolina
be
run
by
south
carolinians,
and...
mr.
charles
condon
well,
when
you've
got
a
statute
like
the
wage
an
hour
that
applies
across
the
board,
and
is
part
of
the
national
fabric,
here,
as
to
what's
going
on
here...
and
again,
we're
for
protecting...
mr.
charles
condon
except
for
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
data
bases
that
isn't
covered
by
this.
faa
has
data
bases
on
the
internet
with
people's
personal
information,
the
fcc,
the
icc.
it's
at
the
state
level.
it's
us
we
have
to
implement.
they're
commandeering
our
officials
in
terms
of
how
to
apply
this
act,
and
again...
mr.
charles
condon
that
may
be
a
possibility,
but
there
are
other...
this
is...
what
should
be
done
here
as
a
last,
last
resort
has
been
the
first
resort.
the
congress
could
directly
regulate
individuals
who
get
these
records.
the
congress
could
take
our
records,
take
this
burden
over.
we
can
do
other
things
with
our
time.
but
what
they've
done,
they've
gone
right
after
the
states
with
an
act
that
really
doesn't
work
to
begin
with.
it's
very
complex,
and
in
terms
of
this
court's
decision
in
terms
of
printz
and
new
york,
it
raises
the
exact
same
principles
that
are
at
stake,
and
we
simply
would
ask,
on
behalf
of
the
states,
to
continue
to
keep...
breathe
new
life
with
your
prior
decisions
into
our
dual
sovereignty
system,
which
protects
us
all.
mr.
charles
condon
i
think
in
terms
of
the
principles,
we're
at
the
comity
level,
especially
when...
mr.
charles
condon
again,
that's
not
the
case
before
here.
there's
time
enough
for
that.
mr.
charles
condon
democratic
accountability.
as
a
matter
of...
mr.
charles
condon
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
condon
but
as
a
matter
of
information,
we've
gone
further
in
south
carolina
than
the
federal
act.
we
protect
privacy
more
now,
and
that's
really
the
point.
let
the
states
run
their
own
records,
let
them
make
those
individual
choices,
and
we're
accountable
to...
mr.
charles
condon
that's
precisely
our
point,
to
let
us
run
our
records,
and
again,
i
understand
that
this
case
has
broad
implications
for
the
future,
but
when
you
look
at
what's
going
on
here
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
feel
that
the
prior
holdings
in
new
york
and
printz
dictate
this
result.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
