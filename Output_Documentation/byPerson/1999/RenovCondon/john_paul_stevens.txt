justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
sure
of
that,
as
factual
predicate
for
that
statement?
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
private
airports
that
are
operated
by
private
parties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said,
really,
this
is
good
to
the
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
also
raises
a
question
in
my
mind
is,
if
there
is
this
unwritten
constitutional
principle,
the
federal
government
may
never
pass
a
law
that
imposes
burdens
on
states
that
don't
also
impose
burdens
on
private
parties.
why
wouldn't
that
principle,
if
it
is
a
valid
principle,
apply
to
spending
legislation
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
surely
you
couldn't...
surely
the
congress
couldn't
give
the
states
money
on
condition
that
they
close
up
all
their
newspapers,
for
example,
or
something
like
that.
if
there's
an
overriding
federal
constitutional
principle,
it
seems
to
me
it
must
limit
the
spending
authority
as
well
as
the
commerce
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean...
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
fine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
central
theory?
as
i
understand
it,
your
central
theory
is
that
unless
the
statute
regulates
both
private
conduct
and
state
conduct,
it's
invalid
under
a
tenth
amendment
concern.
and
that's
supported
by
the
fact
that
as
far
as
you
can
say,
and
i
don't
think
the...
your
opponents
have
found
anything...
historically,
it
just
hasn't
been
done,
and
so
you
say
that
we
must
assume
that
there
is
this
constitutional
limitation
on
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
states.
now,
does
that
principle
mean,
for
example,
that
congress
could
not
pass
a
statute
the
obverse
of
this,
requiring
states
to
send
their...
all
of
the
information
about
criminal
conduct,
finger
prints,
missing
children,
and
so
forth,
to
a
central
bureau
in
washington
for
review
and
use
and
for
federal
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
my
example
is
one...
i
don't
think
the
test
is
how
burdensome
it
is.
the
test,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
and
i
want
you
to
enlighten
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
the
absence
of
impact
on
private
parties,
and
the
statute
just
impacts
on
the
states,
and
i
give
you
an
example
and
you
say,
well,
that's
all
right
because
it's
not
very
serious,
or
does
the
principle
apply
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
routinely
require
the
police
to
report
all
missing
children,
and
finger
prints,
and
something
of
that
kind.
it's...
it
requires
the
information.
it
doesn't
require
it
be
kept
quiet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
it
this
case?
that's
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you...
i
know
you've
been
interrupted,
and
i
hate
to
do
it
to
you
again.
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
principle
apply
to
my
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it...
i
should
think
you'd
have
to
say
it
must
if
there
is
really
a
principle
and
not
just
an
accident
of
history.
it
may
well
be
true
that
some
things
have
never...
the
federal
government
may
have
never
done
some
things
in
the
past,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
power
isn't
there,
even
though
unexercised
for
200
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
an
argument
about
the
wisdom
of
the
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
you
beat
up...
if
a
state
official
beats
up
a
prisoner
he
can
get
fined
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
fact
that
there's...
justice
john
paul
stevens
criminal
penalties
attached
to
state
violation
of
federal
law
doesn't
really
make
it
any
different
than
a
lot
of
other
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
you
could
also
have
a
speed
limit
that
if
they
violate
it,
that...
you
know,
the
fact
that
criminal
penalties
attach
doesn't
really
reach
the
question
of
what
congress'
power
is,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
anyway.
