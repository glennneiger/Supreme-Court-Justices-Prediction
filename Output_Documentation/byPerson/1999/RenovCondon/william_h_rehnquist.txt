we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
98-1464,
janet
reno
v.
charlie
condon,
attorney
general
of
south
carolina.
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
general
waxman,
the
government
says
it's
the
commerce
clause
authority
here,
not
anything
to
do
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here...
here,
the
act
certainly
does
in
effect
impose
duties
on
people
in
the
motor
vehicle
division,
where
you
get
a
request
for
information.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
categorical
prohibition.
the
people
in
the
motor
vehicle
division
have
to
be
very
familiar
with
this
federal
statute
to
know
whether
to
issue
the
thing
or
whether
to
deny
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
doubt
there
that
commerce
was
affected,
i
take
it,
so
that
it
was
not
a
question
of
congress'
commerce
power,
but
a
question
of
other
limitations
on
that
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
condon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
position
as
i
understood
it,
general
condon,
was
that
various
state
employees
in
the
motor
vehicle
division
were
being
pressed
into
service,
because
the
complicated
federal
regulatory
scheme
required
them
to
administer,
in
effect,
that
act,
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
release
particular
information
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
it
seems
to
me
people
are
being
commandeered
perhaps
even
more
so
than
in
this
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
condon.
general
waxman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
the
tenth
amendment
applies
with
all
its
force
to
local
governments
as
opposed
to
state
governments.
you're
talking
about
the
regulation
applies
to
local
governments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
