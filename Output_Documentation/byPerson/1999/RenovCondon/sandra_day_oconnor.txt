and
what
are
the
other
examples
of
congress'
choice
to
regulate
states
alone,
exclusively
under
the
commerce
clause
power,
rather
than
general
legislation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
could
be
the
case,
but
i
still
have
my
question,
if
there
are
other
examples...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
congress'
choice
under
the
commerce
clause
power
to
regulate
exclusively
the
states.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
discussion
is
a...
has
a
little
bit
of
an
academic
quality
in
light
of
recent
congressional
action,
i
take
it,
which
now
is
out
there
telling
the
states
that
if
they
don't
have
these
privacy
protections
they
will
lose
federal
transportation
funding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
one
sense,
though,
the
act
does
regulate
use
of
the
information
by
both
the
states
and
private
parties
into
whose
hands
the
information
comes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is,
to
a
degree,
broader.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
also,
in
part,
about
privacy,
because
your
state
chooses
to
sell
the
information
and
make
it
public,
and
the
federal
legislation
would
say
to
the
state,
you
can't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sure
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
example.
i
think
congress
passed
the
internet
tax
freedom
act,
and
it
told
states
they
couldn't
tax
these
internet
transactions
for
a
period
of
time,
can't
do
it.
i
suppose
under
your
theory
that's
invalid,
too.
it
only
dealt
with
the
states
and
governmental
entities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
that's
invalid,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
that's
a
far
cry
from
the
kind
of
commandeering
of
state
personnel
that
concerned
the
court
in
printz,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
might
need
to.
that's
the
point.
i
don't
think
that
the
commandeering
rationale
of
printz
quite
covers
this,
and
yet
the
old
law
under
usery
pre-garcia,
we
might
say
this
is
a
traditional
state
function,
but
what
are
you
saying
to
us,
that
we
ought
to
go
back
to
that,
or...
or
what?
