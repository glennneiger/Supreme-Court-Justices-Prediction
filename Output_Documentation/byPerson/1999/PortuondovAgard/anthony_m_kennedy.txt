could
the
prosecutor
make
that
remark
without
correction
from
the
district...
from
the
trial
judge
if
the
defendant's
testimony
on
the
stand
was
in
all
respects
consistent
with
the
testimony...
with
his
previous
statements
that
he'd
given
to
the
police,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
he
said,
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
you
know,
this
man's
been
here,
and
so
his
testimony
is
pretty
well
rehearsed.
if...
would
it
be
proper
for
the
trial
judge
to
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
the
testimony
he's
given
has
been
consistent
with
his
previous
testimony.
could
the
trial
judge
interrupt
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
to
be
a
factual
predicate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
concern
is,
is
that
if
we
adopt
your
position,
which
is
not
without
some
strong
reasons
to
recommend
it,
that
although
that's...
this
comment
is
not
usually
made
now,
a
year
hence
it
will
be
standard.
it
will
be
in
every
prosecutor's
manual,
and
then
the
trial
judge
will
have
to
say,
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
occurrence
were
the
defendant
not
present
at
all
phases
of
the
trial.
he
must
be
present
in
order
to
assist
his
counsel
and
be
apprised
of
the
charges
against
him,
and
therefore
you
cannot
hold
that
against...
and
so
we
go
back
and
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
a
trial
judge
could
go
on
and
say,
if
you
find
he
altered
his
testimony
by
reason
of
his
presence
you
can
take
that...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
into
account.
but
the
whole
point
is,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
new
area
in
which
we're
going
to
have
comment,
countercomment,
instructions...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
an
important
possible
explanation.
suppose
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
did
not
make
this
argument
and,
after
an
hour
of
deliberation,
the
jury
sends
a
note
to
the
judge
and
they
say,
dear
judge,
we
know
the
defendant
probably
should
be
present
at
the
trial,
maybe
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
at
trial,
but
we
think
that
in
this
case
his
presence
enabled
him
to
tailor
his
testimony,
can
we
hold
that
tailoring
against
him.
what's
the
judge
supposed
to
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
why
the
prosecutor
really
argued
anything
different
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
in
effect
that
a
juror
cannot
sit
in
the
jury
room
and
say,
you
know,
this
guy
was
very
smooth,
and
the
reason
he
was
is
because
he
was
there,
and
that's
the
way
i
think.
you
don't
think
the
jury
could
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
astounding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
understand
your
answer.
so
you're
saying
that
the
question
justice
scalia
proposes
is
proper.
the
counsel's
very
sarcastic.
it
was,
now
you've
been
here
for
3
days,
and
you've
heard
all
of
these
witness...
that's
why
you're
telling
the
story
you're
telling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
improper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
other
words,
it's
objectionable.
you
can
raise
an
objection
to
that
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
justice
breyer
is
right.
let's
assume
justice
breyer
is
right
that
this
is
permitted
under
the
law
of
new
york.
then
what
is
the
answer
to
his
question
about
the
constitutional
issue
as
you
would
put
it,
precisely?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
he
has
to
bring
it
up...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think...
why
aren't
you
entitled...
why
aren't
you
fully
protected
by
an
instruction
from
the
court,
if
you
want
to
ask
for
it,
say
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
defendant
has
an
absolute
right
to
be
at
the
counsel
table.
he
must
be
there
to
assist
in
the
prosecution
of
his
case.
the
mere
fact
that
he's
present
alone
you
cannot
hold
against
him.
now,
if
you
think
he
tailored
his
testimony,
if
you
find
that,
then
that
is
relevant
to
determining
his
credibility.
what's
wrong
with
that
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
instruction
as
i
gave
it
to
you,
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
present,
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
present
cannot
be
held
against
him,
if
you
think
that
he
used
his
presence
in
order
to
tailor
his
testimony,
then
that...
then
you
may
consider
that.
now,
if
you
want
that
instruction,
then
i
suppose
you
can
get
it.
i'm
not
sure
you'd
want
it,
according...
