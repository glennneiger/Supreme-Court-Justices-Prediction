justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
why...
maybe
i've
got
the
assumption
wrong,
but
are
you
conceding
that
there
was
no
cause
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
mention
this?
i
mean,
i
counted
six
or
seven
times
in
which
the
defense
attorney
emphasized
the
word
consistency,
three
times
in
which
he
said...
or
maybe
it
was
two
or
three,
the
defense
attorney
says,
the
defendant
told
a
totally
consistent
story.
he
didn't
use
the
word
totally,
he
says
a
consistent
story,
and
about
three
or
four
times
in
which
he
said
the
prosecuting
witness'
story
was
inconsistent,
so
the
prosecutor
gets
up
and
says,
sure
it
was
consistent,
he
heard
all
the
witnesses.
i
mean,
is
this...
are
we
supposed
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
there
was
no
cause
for
the
prosecutor
to
say,
well,
he
heard
the
witnesses,
that's
why
he
was
consistent.
he
just
heard
the
defense
attorney
say
he
was
inconsistent.
well,
you
know,
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
this
case?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
am
i
not
supposed
to
look
at
the
specifics
of
the
case
when
i
decide
the
legal
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
that...
then
why
aren't
you
arguing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
constitutional
right?
i'm
having
a
problem
to
know
how
to
decide
this.
i
counted
the
word
consistent
appearing
11
times
in
a
rather
short
summation
by
the
defense
about
half
divided
between
my
client's
story
is
consistent,
the
complaining
witness'
story
is
not
consistent.
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
under
those
circumstances,
no
rule
of
evidence
in
new
york
is
violated.
now,
what
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
says
new
york's
rule
of
evidence
there
is
wrong?
i
mean,
don't
we
have
to
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
11
appearances
of
the
word
consistency
in
a
short
closing
argument,
and
don't
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
under
new
york
law
of
evidence,
under
those
circumstances,
no
rule
of
evidence
is
violated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
my
question
is,
what
is
the
question
before
us?
if
new
york's
law
says
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
law
of
evidence
to
make
this
comment,
of
course
his
story's
consistent,
he
sat
there
and
heard
the
witnesses...
that's
the
law
in
new
york,
all
right.
now,
what
part
of
the
constitution
does
that
violate?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
i
have...
i
couldn't
find...
new
york
apparently
just
didn't
say.
they
didn't
discuss
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
the
law
of
evidence,
not...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
law
of
evidence
in
new
york
is
that
under
these
circumstances
no
law
of
evidence
is
violated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
they
made
a
mistake
about
that.
well,
why
did
the
new
york
courts
affirm
this
conviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
look,
i
mean,
what
i'm
driving
at
is
fairly
simple.
i'm
sure
that
the
prosecution
would
like
a
universal
law
that
you
could
make
this
comment
even
no
matter
what,
just
make
it
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky,
and
what
i'm
driving
at
is,
the
record
before
us
is
not
the
clear
blue
sky,
at
least
as
i
read
it,
and
i'm
not
using
a
doctrine
of
invited
error,
i'm
using
a
doctrine
of
no
error.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
i've
read
the
record.
i
think
they're
wrong
about
that.
i
found
11
instances
in
which
it
uses
the
word
consistent.
i
won't
repeat
myself.
you
heard
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
say...
they
didn't
use
the
word
tailoring.
i
thought
what
they
said
was,
in
a
very
complicated
factual
story
the
lawyer
says,
look,
my
client's
been
consistent,
the
complaining
witness
wasn't,
and
what
the
prosecutor
says
is,
sure,
he
sat
here,
why
wouldn't
he
be
consistent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
didn't
use
the
word...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
she
actually
said
was,
use
your
common
sense.
you
know,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
unlike
the
other
witnesses,
he
has
a
benefit,
the
benefit
he
has
is,
he
gets
to
sit
here
and
listen
to
the
testimony
of
the
other
witnesses.
that's...
all
right.
now,
she
said
that
in
response,
i
gather,
to
the
defense
lawyer
saying
nonstop,
my
client's
story
was
consistent,
the
complaining
witness
wasn't.
i'll
stop,
because...
