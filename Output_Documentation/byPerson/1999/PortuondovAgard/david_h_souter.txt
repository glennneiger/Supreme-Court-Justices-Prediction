justice
david
h.
souter
well,
with
respect
to
the
exposure
to
the
others,
i'd
like
you
just
to
go
back
to
doyle
for
a
minute.
one
of
the
strands
of
reasoning
in
doyle
was
that
the
defendant's
post
miranda
silence
was...
i
think
it
was
ambiguous.
i
forget
what
adjective
was...
insolubly
ambiguous,
i
think
was
the
phrase
that
the
court
used.
don't
we
have
an
insoluble
ambiguity
problem
in
the
predicate
for
the
comment
in
issue
here,
because
to
the
extent
that
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
is,
in
fact,
congruent
with
that
of
other
witnesses
save
at
some,
you
know,
crucial
exculpatory
point,
we
don't
know,
and
i
presume
in
the
absence
of
some
affirmative
evidence
going
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
particular
statements,
there's
no
way
for
a
jury
to
know
whether
in
fact
that
congruence
is
the
result
of
truth
or
the
result
of
tailoring.
so
that
if
a
comment
like
this,
let
alone
an
instruction
on
this
point,
is
given
in
the
absence
of
some
affirmative
reason
in
the
evidence
to
think
that
there
was
particular
tailoring
on
a
particular
point,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
the
ambiguity,
as
in
doyle,
would
simply
give
the
jury
kind
of
a
wild
card.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true,
but
whether
we're
dealing
with
something
that
goes
to
impeachment
or
whether
we're
dealing
with
something
that
goes
to
guilt,
there
is
the
problem
of
ambiguity,
and
it's
the
ambiguity
that's
bothering
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nuechterlein...
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nuechterlein,
you
mentioned
in
distinguishing
doyle
the
risk
there
of
the
jury's
confusing
impeachment
with
proof
of
guilt.
isn't
that
risk
equally
great
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
jury
is
going
to
go
from
mere
presence
to
a
suspicion
of
tailoring.
tailoring
is
lying,
and
as
the
old
saw
has
it,
a
man
who
will
lie
will
steal,
or
whatever.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
risk,
that
the
jury
will
sort
of
follow
that
sequence
of
reasoning?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
maybe
it
would,
but
does
it
also
eviscerate
the
line
between
doyle
and
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
estoppel
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
point,
when
the
question...
when
justice
kennedy's
question
says,
this
guy
was
very
smooth,
wouldn't
that
be,
in
fact,
an
evidentiary
basis?
i
mean,
the
suggestion
is,
sounds
a
little
too
smooth,
and
i
don't
know
that
your
position
requires
you
to
say
that
that
would
be
inappropriate.
why
do
you
say
that
is
inappropriate?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
in
effect
saying
that
if
the
testimony
is,
shall
we
say,
unrealistically
smooth,
that
that
may
not
be
considered?
he's
a
very
good
witness,
therefore
he
must
be
lying.
i
mean...
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
i
really
don't
think
that
facing
that
issue
is
what
you
necessarily
have
to
do
in
this
case,
but
maybe
i
misunderstand
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that...
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know,
that
goes
to
the,
you
know,
the
insoluble
ambiguity
point,
but
when
you
start
talking
about
sort
of
unusual
smoothness,
i
think
we
are
outside...
or
at
least
as
i'm
using
the
term,
i
think
we're
outside
of
the
kind
of
testimony
which
is
insolubly
ambiguous,
and
don't
you...
isn't
that
a
distinction
that
can
be
drawn?
it
may
be
a
fine
line
to
draw,
but
isn't
that
a
distinction
that
can
be
drawn?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
so
all
you're
saying
i
think
is
that
it
would
be...
put
it
this
way.
put
it
in
terms
of
instructions.
you're
saying
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court,
or
you're
implying
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
say,
because
the
defendant
in
any
criminal
case
has
the
greatest
interest
of
anyone
in
the
courtroom,
or
any
witness
in
the
courtroom,
you
should
devalue
the
defendant's
testimony
for
interest
greater
than
you'd
devalue
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
who
may
be
interested.
you're...
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what
about
the
position
in
which
the
court
gives
this
instruction.
people
who
are
in
the
courtroom
and
hear
other
witnesses
can
tailor
their
testimony.
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
in
the
courtroom,
as
he
has
done.
therefore,
you
should
devalue
the
defendant's
testimony
for
that
reason,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
say
that
was
a
wrong
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
would
say
it
was
a
wrong
instruction
because,
as
i've
given
the
hypothesis,
there's
no
particularized
basis
in
any
evidence
for
applying
that
rule
of
devaluation,
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
there
is
a
particularized
basis,
whether
the
eyes
are
going
back
and
forth
in
justice
scalia's
example,
or
whether
there
is
an
impression
of
oily
smoothness
in
justice
kennedy's
example,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
are
outside
the
realm
of
pure
speculation.
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
you've...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
going
back
to
judge
winters'
point
that
justice
ginsburg
raised,
if
there
had
been
a
prior
inconsistent
statement
here
and
that
had
been
brought
out,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper,
even
only
at
the
last
minute,
in
closing
argument,
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
the
tailoring
argument
here.
the
timing
is
not
crucial
to
you,
judge
winters'
seeming
suggestion
that
it
was
the
fact
that
this
didn't
surface...
justice
david
h.
souter
this
tailoring
claim
didn't
surface
until
the
last
minute
in
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument,
when
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
respond,
that
is
not
crucial,
i
take
it,
in
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
there
had
been
a
prior
inconsistent
statement,
the
word
tailoring
and
the
tailoring
argument
had
never
come
up
until
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument,
i
take
it
on
your
view
the
argument
would
have
been
proper
for
the
prosecutor,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
