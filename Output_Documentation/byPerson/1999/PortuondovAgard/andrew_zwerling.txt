mr.
andrew
zwerling
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
a
prosecutor
should
be
permitted,
even
for
the
first
time
on
summation,
to
ask
the
jury
to
consider
the
credibility-influencing
factor
of
a
defendant's
nonsequestered
status
as
a
witness,
particularly
where,
as
here,
it's
conceded
that
such
status
creates
a
risk
of
truth-distortion.
allowing
this
would
be
consistent
with
the
century-old
principle
articulated
by
this
court
that
for
impeachment
purposes,
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand,
he's
to
be
treated
like
any
other
witness.
this
rule
materially
advances
the
fundamental
goal
of
truth-seeking
that
this
court
has
often
spoken
about.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
the
prosecutor
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
that
as
for
impeachment
purposes
the
jury
could
consider
the
effects,
if
any,
of
the
defendant's
status
as
a
nonsequestered
witness.
i
mean,
this
court
has
recognized
since
biblical
times...
or,
not
this
court
has
recognized
since
biblical
times.
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
zwerling
the
short
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
the
prosecutor
would
not
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
as
to
guilt
the
jury
could
consider
the
effects,
if
any,
of
the
defendant's
nonsequestered
status.
it
would
solely
be
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
could
the
prosecutor
still
make
that
remark?
mr.
andrew
zwerling
the
prosecutor
in
the
first
instance,
judge,
would
not
be
able
to
stand
up
without
any
factual
predicate
whatsoever,
make
the
argument
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant's
testimony
is
in
some
way
tailored,
simply
by
virtue
of
the...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
to
make
an
affirmative
claim
of
tailoring,
your
honor,
but
i
just
want
to
state
as
a
threshold
principle
that
just,
much
in
the
way
that
a
jury
can
consider
a
defendant's
interest
in
the
outcome,
you
do
not
need
a
factual
predicate,
other
than
the
defendant's
exposure
to
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
to
throw
out
that
question
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration
as
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
what,
if
any,
impact
that
exposure
had.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
it
simply
wouldn't
be
a
rational
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
if
the
prosecutor,
under
those
circumstances,
stood
up
and
said
to
the
jury
that
a
statement,
or...
well,
this
is
assuming
that
the
prosecutor
relied
upon
that
confession
at
trial.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
if
it's
excluded,
your
honor,
and
the
prosecutor
stood
up
as
an
officer
of
the
court
and
told
the
jury
that
the
testimony
at
trial
was
the
first
time
that
the
defendant
has
stood
up
to
give
this
particular
version,
then
it
would
be
error.
it
wouldn't
be
error
under
griffin
analysis.
it
would
be
another
form
of
prosecutorial...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
yes,
your
honor.
in
every
case
where
the
defendant
has
been
exposed
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses,
like
any
other
witness,
he's
subject
to
the
ills
of
nonsequestration,
and
therefore
it
is
proper
for
the
prosecutor
in
every
case
to
throw
that
question
of
fact
out
to
the
jury
in
much
the
same
way
as
a
prosecutor
is
permitted,
as
this
court
has
sanctioned,
to
make
the
argument
that
a
defendant's
interest
in
the
outcome
may
have
affected
his
credibility
as
a
witness.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
i
can't
speak
for
every
state,
but
it's
certainly
true
in
your
honor...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
a
couple
of
ways,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
this
particular
issue
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
trial
court,
wasn't
raised
in
any
state
appellate
litigation,
or
even
in
the
federal
courts
below.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
respondent's
brief
before
this
court.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
well,
in
new
york,
your
honor,
a
defendant
can
waive
his
presence
at
trial
upon
application
to
the
court.
now,
while
it's
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
to
grant
that
application,
nonetheless
that's
an
application
that
could
be
made
by
a
defendant,
and
we're
not
in
this
particular
case
in
a
position
to
know
what
the
trial
court
would
have
done,
because
no
such
request
was
made.
if
such
a
request
was
made
and
even
denied,
then
perhaps
a
defendant
could
request
a
jury
instruction
to
alert
the
jury...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
well...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
it's
not
possible
to
detect
how
a
witness'
testimony
might
have
been
affected
by
the
nonsequestered
status.
ironically,
the
second
circuit
in
the
jackson
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
stated
that
it's
virtually
impossible
to
say
how
a
person's
testimony
would
have
been
affected,
and
consistency
with
pretrial
statements
is
just
one
factor
that
can
go
into
discerning
whether
or
not
some
confabulation
took
place,
or
some
alteration,
intentional
alteration
took
place.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
in
the
interested
witness
context,
your
honor,
there
may
very
well
be
defendants
whose
testimony
is
unaffected
by
their
interest
in
the
outcome.
nonetheless,
they
are
subjected
to
an
interested
witness
charge
and
it's
up
to
the
jury,
as
a
trier
of
fact,
to
determine
what
effect,
if
any,
that
individual's
interest
had
on
their
reliability
as
a
witness.
similarly,
here...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
they
cover
different
subjects,
your
honor.
the
interested
witness
charge
goes
to
a
motive
to
lie.
exposure
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
goes
to
an
opportunity
to
lie
and,
even
not
just
lie,
there's
an
issue
of
confabulation,
innocent
alterations
in
testimony,
replacing
facts...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
i'm
not...
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
i'm
using
the
interested
witness
charge
scenario
by
analogy.
just
as
a
prosecutor
doesn't
have
to
prove
or
lay
a
factual
predicate
that
the
defendant's
interest
actually
affected
his
testimony
in
order
to
get
a
charge,
a
prosecutor
doesn't
have
to
actually
prove
that
a
defendant's
testimony
was
altered,
either
innocently
or
purposefully,
as
a
predicate
for
getting...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
in
this
case,
all
of
the
other
witnesses
was
sequestered,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
but
again,
similar
to
an
interested
witness
scenario,
in
most
cases,
or
in
many
cases
the
defendant
is
the
only
witness
who
has
an
interest
in
the
outcome.
a
charge,
an
interested
witness
charge
isn't
singling
the
defendant
out
because
under
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
he
happens
to
be
the
only
one
with
an
interest
in
the
outcome.
they're
singling
out
the
defendant
in
that
context,
and
in
the
context
before
the
court,
because
there's
some
external
factor,
either
a
defendant's
interest
in
the
outcome,
or
his
exposure
to
the
testimony
of
witnesses
that
may
affect
his
credibility.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
it's
two-pronged,
your
honor,
one
specifically
dealing
with
the
facts
in
doyle,
and
then
a
more
general
response.
in
response
to
the
doyle
prong
of
the
question,
in
doyle
in
both
footnote
number
10
of
that
decision
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
written
by
justice
stevens,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
prosecutor
in
that
case
used
the
defendant's,
or
the
apparent
inconsistency
between
the
defendant's
testifying
at
trial
and
his
silence
after
receiving
miranda
warnings
as
proof
of
guilt.
it
was
referred
to
in
footnote
10
that
the
prosecutor
implied
guilt,
and
it
was
dealt
with
more
specifically
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
the
prosecutor
asked
the
jury,
or
suggested
to
the
jury
that
the
testimony,
or
that
inconsistency
was
inconsistent
with
innocence.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
yes,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
the
ambiguity,
however,
in
this
particular...
with
this
particular
credibility
influencing
factor,
it's
been
recognized
that
it
does
have
effect,
have
an
effect
on
a
witness
who's
exposed
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses,
and...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
specifics
of
this
case,
the...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
in
terms
of
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
the
prosecutor's
remarks
were
entirely
proper.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
they're
proper
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
a)
they
were
invited
by
the
remarks
of
defense
counsel,
which
resounded
from
the
outset
of
the
trial
in
his
opening
statement,
through
his
summation,
where
he
argued
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
prosecution
witnesses
were
exposed
to
one
another,
therefore
they
tailored
their
testimony,
therefore
they
fabricated
this
story
against
the
defendant,
and
under
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
proper
for
the
prosecutor
to
stand
up
and
say,
well,
they
may
have
been
exposed
to
one
another,
but
the
defendant
was
exposed
to
everybody.
those
remarks
were
invited
by
the
remarks
of
defense
counsel,
and
the
prosecutor's
remarks
in
this
case
were
a
reasonable
response,
and
she
didn't...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
your
honor,
to
make
myself
clear,
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
the
generic
argument,
to
throw
the
question
of
fact
out
to
the
jury
you
should
consider
the
effects
of
the
defendant's
exposure
to
testimony.
you
don't
need
a
factual
predicate
more
than
his
exposure
to
the
testimony
of
others.
in
this
particular
case...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
the
prosecutor
did
more
than
throw
out
that
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
the
prosecutor
made
an
affirmative
statement
that
the
defendant
tailored,
he
altered
purposefully
his
testimony,
and
where
a
prosecutor
is
going
to
do
that,
there
has
to
be
some
factual
predicate.
either
the
remarks
have
to
be
invited,
or
as
she
also
did,
she
laid
out
a
factual
predicate.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
if
they
are
made
after
the
motive
to
lie
arose.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
in
this
particular
case,
the
defendant
could
not
have
brought
out
his
prior
consistent
statements,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
no,
your
honor.
i
think
a
clear
distinction
should
be
drawn.
there's
the
constitutional
analysis
which
the
respondent
in
the
second
circuit
had
been
relying
upon,
and
then
there
are
rules
of
evidence.
the
line
should
be
drawn,
and
it
has
been
drawn
by
this
court
in
the
past,
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
under
the
facts...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
griffin
penalty
analysis
is
implicated
by
virtue
of
such
comments,
and
the
answer
is
no,
because
the
prosecutor's
comments
in
no
way
created
the
suggestion
that
the
jury
should
take
those
comments
and
rely
upon
them
as
proof
of
guilt
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
i
see
the
white
light
has
gone
on.
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
andrew
zwerling
addressing
the
issue
of
the
insoluble
ambiguity,
or
that
in
the
absence
of
a
particularized
showing
of
actual
tailoring,
that
that
gives
rise
to
an
invitation
to
speculate,
if
the
witness
in
question
who
was
not
sequestered
is
not
a
defendant,
the
court
can
give
a
jury
instruction
that
they
can
consider
that
fact,
and
to
consider
the
effects,
if
any,
that
that
nonsequestration
had
on
that
particular
witness.
so
what
respondent
in
the
second
circuit
are
positing
is
a
possible
scenario
in
which
there
is
more
than
one
nonsequestered
witness
in
addition
to
the
defendant,
and
that
a
jury
instruction
can
be
given
that
the
jury
can
consider
as
to
those
witnesses
the
effects,
if
any,
nonsequestration
had
on
their
reliability,
but
no
such
instruction
would
be
given
as
to
a
defendant,
and
that
under
those
circumstances
the
jury's
going
to
go
into
that
deliberations
room
saying,
well,
i
guess
we
can't
hold
that
against
the
defendant,
we
can
only
hold
that
against
the
credibility...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
addressing
particularly
summation
comment,
the
same
parallel
holds
true.
that
would
mean
that
there
would
be
a
scenario
in
which
a
defense
attorney
can
stand
up,
as
was
done
in
this
particular
case,
blister
the
credibility
of
the
prosecution
witnesses
based
upon
their
exposure
to
one
another,
or
if
they
were
nonsequestered
witness,
could
blister
the
credibility
of
that
witness
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
weren't
sequestered,
and
then
a
prosecutor
would
have
to
stand
up
and
would
be
handcuffed
and
not
be
able
to
say
anything
based
upon
the
fact
that
another
nonsequestered
witness,
the
defendant,
was
also
sitting
in
that
courtroom,
and
i
also
want
to...
mr.
andrew
zwerling
but
so
long
as
the
jury
is
informed
that
they
can
consider
that
fact
as
it
bears
upon
the
defendant's
credibility,
clearly,
you
know,
additional
language
in
an
instruction
alerting
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
must
be
there,
for
example,
under
new
york
law...
