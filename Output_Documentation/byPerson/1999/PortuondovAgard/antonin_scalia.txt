justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
is...
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
really
hard
one,
mr.
zwerling.
what
if
the
prosecutor
knows
that
his
testimony,
that
the
defendant's
testimony
is
entirely
consistent
with
a
confession
that
was
given
earlier
and
that
has
been
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
it
was
excluded
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
different
issue.
it's
just
an
additional
argument.
i
mean,
he
has
raised
the
issue
of
the
improper
comment
by
the
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
have
to
be
invited,
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
i
don't
understand
the
defendant
here
to
be
asserting
what
those...
that
judge's
instruction
would
have
told
the
jury,
that
you
therefore
can't
take
it
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
agreed
by
both
sides
that
the
jury
can
take
account
of
the
fact
that
he's
been
sitting
in
court
during
the
entire
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
jury
is
not
entitled
to
an
instruction,
as
it
is
with
regard
to
the
right,
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
of
nonincrimination.
the
jury
is
not
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
you
should
not
take...
you
should
not
take
the
defendant's
refusal
to
testify
to
be
an
admission
of
guilt.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nuechterlein,
if
we
applied
doyle
here,
we
would
again
have
to
instruct
the
jury
not
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
he
has
heard
all
the
testimony.
it
wouldn't
be
just
a
question
of
whether...
whether
the
prosecutor
can
invite
the
jury's
attention
to
that
fact.
the
jury
would
be
entitled,
if
we
are...
as
i
understand
doyle,
if
we
are
following
doyle,
the
jury...
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
you
shall
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
he's
heard
all
the
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms....
more
than
that,
ms.
van
ness.
if
that
is
what
this
case
is
about,
just
a
fight
over
whether
in
fact
the
prosecutor
made
an
accusation
of
tailoring
that
had
no
possible
basis
in
fact,
you
should
have
made
that
point,
it
seems
to
me,
in
your
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
if
i
had
known
that's
all
the
case
is
about,
i
don't
think
i
would
have
taken
it.
we're
not
interested
in
deciding
that
factual
question.
the
question
presented
makes
it
very
clear
that
it's
talking
about
a
much
more
broader,
much
broader
and
more
important
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
a
little
late
to
put
it
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
always
speculating
as
to
whether
the
witness
is
telling
the
truth
or
not,
and
you
speculate
on
the
basis
of
various
considerations,
and
you're
usually
allowed
to
call
those
considerations
to
the
jury's...
what
if
the
witness'
eyes
are
shifting
all
around
the
courtroom
during
the
testimony.
he
looks
very
much
like
a
person
who's
lying.
can
the
prosecutor
call
attention
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
he
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
position
is
really...
is
really,
i
was
erroneous
when
i
said
i
didn't
think
either
side,
that
you
were
making...
you
are
making
the
contention
that
the
jury...
not
only
may
the
prosecutor
not
call
the
jury's
attention
to
it,
the
jury
may
not
consider
it,
and
presumably
you
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
should
take
no
account
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
been
sitting
here
listening
to
all
the
testimony,
because
i
don't
see
any
other
evidence
of
tailoring.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly,
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
whether
the
constitution
has
been
violated
or
not
presumably,
under
what
you've
accepted,
by
deciding
whether,
in
fact,
the
defendant
was
smooth
or
too
smooth.
is
that
going
to
be
the
critical
constitutional
fault
line,
whether
he
was
just
smooth
smooth
or
oily
smooth?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
seriously
the
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
are
you
accepting
the
premise
that
what
is
wrong
in
a
judge's
instruction
is
also
wrong
in
a
prosecutor's
argument?
is
everything
that
a
prosecutor
says
in
final
argument
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
say
in
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
doesn't
add
the
latter
part.
he
just
says,
you've
been
sitting
here
in
the
courtroom
during
this
whole
trial,
and
you
listened
to
all
the
prior
witnesses
as
they
were
testifying
before
you
came
up
here
to
tell
this
story,
is
that
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
he
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
that...
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
don't
understand
the
directly
assailing
your
constitutional
right.
if...
you
cannot
put
any
burden
upon
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
impedes
his
constitutional
right.
what
about
his
constitutional
right
to
testify.
is
that
constitutional
right
impeded
by
cross-examining
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
pay
the
price
for
exercising
that
constitutional
right.
if
you
testify,
you're
subject
to
cross-examination.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
present
at
your
trial,
you're
subject
to
having
the
fact
that
you're
present
at
your
trial
being
pointed
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
isn't,
but
that's
a
question
for
the
jury.
it...
you
know,
it's
a
factor...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
enable
him
to
tailor,
and
the
prosecutor's
just
telling
the
jury,
this
is
a
factor
that
would
enable
him
to
tailor,
but
take
that
into
account
along
with
everything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
thought
that
was
what
you
were
going
to
say.
i
haven't
been
understanding
justice
breyer's
question.
you
seem
to
understand
it.
i
don't
see
what
telling
a
consistent
story
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
you've
heard
the
prior
witnesses
and
tailored.
you
can
have
a
consistent
story
that
contradicts
the
prior
witnesses,
or
you
can
have
a
consistent
story
that
is
in
accord
with
prior
witnesses.
consistency
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you're
tailoring,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
he
would
be
consistent
if
he
had
listened
to
himself
testify.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
enable
him
to
be
consistent.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
didn't
understand
that
he
was
listening
to
himself
testify
while
he...
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
shifty
eyes?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
shifty
eyes?
can
you
bring
that
up
in
final
argument,
or
you
have
to
give
him
a
chance
to
respond
to
that
by
bringing
it
up
in
cross-examination?
i
mean,
he
might
say,
you
know,
i
have
nervous
tick
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
prosecutor
have
to
bring
that
up
in
cross-examine,
or
can
he
just
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
saw
the
defendant
testify
here,
did
you
see
the
way
his
eyes
darted
around
the
room?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
looked
like
a
man
who
was
not
telling
the
truth.
can
he
not
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
as
evidence.
it
goes
to
his
credibility.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
substance
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
to
whether
he
was
an
honest
witness,
just
as
shifty
eyes
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
van
ness,
it
seems
to
me
what
your
principle
boils
down
to
is,
it's
okay
for
the
prosecutor
to
do
it
if
there
is
some...
enough
evidence
to
think
that
there
was
tailoring,
but
he
can't
make
this
statement
if
there
was
not
any
evidence.
this
is
a
very
dangerous
constitutional
principle,
that
the
prosecutor
cannot
in
his
closing
statement
invite
the
jury
to
make
any
factual
determinations,
or
credibility
determinations
that
the
evidence
will
not
support.
is
that
a
constitutional
principle,
that
if
the
prosecutor
goes
beyond
what
the
evidence
will
support,
the
whole
case
can
be
reversed?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
give
the
jury
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to
reject
stupid
arguments?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
just
saying
there's
not
enough
evidence
in
toto
to
prove
that
this
defendant
was
tailoring.
therefore,
the
prosecutor
could
not
suggest
the
possibility
of
tailoring.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
if
there
is
evidence
to
support
it.
you
condition
it
on
that.
