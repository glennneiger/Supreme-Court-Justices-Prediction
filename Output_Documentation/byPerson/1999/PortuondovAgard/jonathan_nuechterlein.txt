mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
it's
nuechterlein,
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
like
any
other
witness,
a
criminal
defendant
who
elects
to
take
the
stand
is
subject
to
fair
comment
on
his
credibility
as
a
witness.
here,
the
prosecutor's
comments
restated
a
basic
principle
of
the
common
law.
that
principle
is
this.
if
a
witness
has
the
opportunity
to
listen
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
before
he
gives
his
own,
it
will
be
more
difficult
for
the
fact-finder
to
detect
any
falsity
in
the
story
he
tells.
that
factor
is,
of
course,
not
dispositive
to
the
witness'
credibility,
but
it
is
certainly
a
relevant
factor
as
the
common
law...
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
think
as
a
general
matter
this
kind
of
comment
is
appropriate.
there
may
be
special
circumstances
in
which
there
are
unusual
indicia
of
consistency.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
the
issue
has
come
up
in
a
handful
of
federal
cases.
it
has
not
come
up
in
a
large
number
of
federal
cases.
that
could
be
the
result
of
one
of
two
factors.
one
is,
either
the
prosecutors
don't
make
this
argument
that
much,
or
it
could
also
be
that
defendants
recognize
the
argument
as
often
being
fair
comment.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i...
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
probably
yes,
but
that
would
be
a
closer
case,
because
there
are
many
contexts
in
which
we
permit
prosecutors
to
make
arguments
to
the
jury
in
their
role
as
advocates
that
we
do
not
permit
judges
to
make
to
the
jury
in
their
role
as
neutral
arbiter
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
actually,
this
comment,
justice
kennedy,
is
made
in
a
number...
has
been
made
in
a
number
of
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
for
example,
cites
about
a
dozen
state
court
cases
in
which
it's
come
up.
the
comments
in
those
cases
were
very
similar
to
the
comments
in
these,
and
after
the
second
circuit
issued
its
original
opinion
in
this
case,
there
has
been
a
handful
of
cases
in
that
jurisdiction
in
which
defendants
have
raised
precisely
this
sort
of
argument.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
had
understood
justice
kennedy's
question
to
relate
to
arguments
the
prosecutor...
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
justice
kennedy,
this
is
not
a
new
area.
in
fact,
for
hundreds
of
years
it
has
been
a
principle
of
the
common
law
that
if
a
witness
is
exposed
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
before
giving
his
own,
that
gives
him
an
advantage,
and
it
is
the
sort
of
advantage
that
a
lawyer
has
a
right
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
again
i
just
want
to
reemphasize
the
point
that
i
believe
that
a
trial
judge
would
have
the
discretion
to
give
that
kind
of
instruction,
but
you
don't
have
to
agree
with
me
on
that
in
order
to
reverse
the
judgment
below,
because
there
really
are
a
variety
of
contexts
in
which
we
want
to
give
prosecutors
leeway
to
make
effective
arguments
where
we
would
not
permit
a
judge
to
make
an
analogous
comment.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
do
not,
for
two
reasons.
one,
doyle
was
significantly
limited
by
subsequent
precedent,
namely
jenkins
v.
anderson
and
fletcher
v.
weir.
in
both
of
those
cases
this
court
observed
that
doyle
was
based
on
an
estoppel
principle.
the
miranda
warning
was
construed
as
an
implicit
assurance
that
the
suspect's
silence
would
not
then
be
used
against
him.
there
is
no
analogous
estoppel
issue
that
arises
here.
secondly,
in
the
doyle
context
there
is
some
risk
that
the
jury
will
view
the
defendant's
prior
silence
as
substantive
evidence
of
guilt.
here,
that
concern
is...
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
what
do
you
mean,
justice
stevens,
when
you
say
it's
a
fortiori...
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
a
lawyer
should
have
discretion
to
make
comments
about
the
credibility
of
the
witness.
one
of
those
is
inconsistency,
but
another
one
would
also
be
the
common
law
rule
that
if
a
defendant
is
exposed
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
before
giving
his
own,
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
fact-finder
to
discern
whether
there's
any
falsity
in
this
story.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
if
doyle
were
the
basis
of
an
opinion
affirming
the
judgment
below,
i
imagine
there
would
be
arguments
analogous
to
carter
v.
kentucky
in
which
defendants
would
claim
a
right
to
a
jury
instruction
of
that
kind.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
no,
that
is
incorrect,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
at
least
four
of
them
cited
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
upheld
the
comments
as
fair
comment.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
don't
think
so.
here
is
why.
in
doyle,
a
jury
might
well
view
a
defendant's
silence
in
the
face
of
accusation
as
substantive
evidence
of
guilt
in
itself.
here,
there
is
no
risk
that
the
jury
could
conceivably
view
the
defendant's
mere
presence
in
the
courtroom
as
evidence
of
guilt.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
justice
souter,
i
think
that
reasoning
proves
too
much,
because
it
would
eviscerate
the
line
this
court
has
always
drawn
between
impeachment
that
goes
to
credibility
and
evidence
that
goes
to
guilt.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
no,
i
don't
think
it
does,
because
the
primary
basis
for
this
court's
holding
in
doyle,
as
the
court
stressed
later
in
fletcher...
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
and
jenkins
is
the
estoppel
point,
and
there
is
no
analogous
problem
here.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
in
chako
there
was
any
actual
proof
of
tailoring,
and
it's
extremely
difficult
ever
to
prove
tailoring,
and
i
guess
our
central
point
is
that
just
as
the
common
law
doesn't
require
a
lawyer
in
other
settings
to
give
evidence
that
a
particular
witness
would
have
given
different
testimony
had
he
not
been
exposed
to
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses,
so,
too,
is
it
inappropriate
here
to
require
the
prosecutor
to
make
that
sort
of
showing
about
a
defendant.
