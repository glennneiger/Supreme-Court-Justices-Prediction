justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
justice
o'connor's
question.
you
said
he
could
get
a
different
question,
but
could...
would
the
prosecutor
be
entitled
to
the
instruction
that
she
suggested,
that
they
may
draw
an
adverse
inference
from
the
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
not
a
rule
of
evidence.
this
is
prosecutorial
misconduct
in
his
comments,
in
argument.
no
evidentiary
question
is
presented,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
here
the
prosecutor
can
make
this
comment
even
though
there's
no...
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
imply
that
there's
some
inconsistency
between
the
testimony
and
the
actual
fact,
whereas
in
doyle,
the
fact
that
he
was
silent
is
in
itself
somewhat
inconsistent
with
his
having
come
up
with
a
story
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
verify
brief
question?
you
refer
to
all
the
state
cases
that's
arisen.
am
i
correct
in
thinking
all
of
those
cases
came
to
the
view
that
this
was
improper
comment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
question
whether
you
think
it
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
for
the
prosecutor
at
the
end
of
his
cross-examination
of
the
defendant,
who's
the
last
witness
in
the
case,
say,
to
ask
questions...
you
were
sitting
in
the
courtroom
throughout
the
trial,
weren't
you,
you
heard
all
the
testimony,
make
the
point
through
cross-examination?
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
wouldn't
authorize
him
to
use
prior
consistent
statements
though,
i
don't
think,
if
they
were
after
he'd
been
arrested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
defendant.
i'm
just
asking
you
if
you
think,
instead
of
saving
the
point
for
argument,
closing
argument,
the
prosecutor
makes
the
point
at
the
end
of
his
cross-examination
of
the
witness,
of
the
defendant
who's
the
last
witness
in
the
trial,
would
that
create
the
same
constitutional
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
