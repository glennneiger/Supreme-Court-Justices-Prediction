justice

mr.
zwerling,
would
the
prosecutor
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
that
the
jury
could
draw
an
adverse
inference
by
virtue
of
the
fact...
as
to
guilt
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
sat
in
the
courtroom
the
whole
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
zwerling,
in
new
york
i
take
it
there's
a
statute
that
requires
the
defendant
to
be
present
at
his
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
isn't
true
in
every
state,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
doyle
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
argument
is
a
little
extreme
in
the
situation
where,
by
state
law,
the
defendant
has
to
be
there,
and
any
time
the
defendant
testifies,
even
if
it's
totally
consistent
with
his
prior
but
excluded
confession,
you
say
the
prosecutor
can
nonetheless
get
up
in
summation
and
try
to
use
his
presence
at
the
trial
against
him.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's...
how
do
you
justify...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
nuechterlein,
do
you
take
the
position
that
there's
just
a
per
se
rule,
that
in
every
case
where
a
defendant
testifies,
that
it's
all
right
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
this
kind
of
comment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
a...
but
you
take
the
position
that
it
would
be
proper
in
every
case.
is
this
something
that
is
commonly
done
by
federal
prosecutors,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
an
instruction
to
the
jury
would
be
appropriate...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
reinforcing
this
statement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
the
doyle
case
cuts
against
your
position
somewhat?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
van
ness...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
a
jury
is
entitled
to
consider
the
interest
of
every
witness
who
testifies,
and
the
fact
that
certainly
the
defendant
is
always
an
interested
witness.
the
defendant
wants
off
the
hook,
and
don't
you
think
the
jury
can
say,
gosh,
we
listened
to
what
the
defendant
said,
but
after
all,
the
defendant
doesn't
want
to
be
convicted,
and
can't
the
jury
say
to
itself,
and
also,
the
defendant
sat
there
the
whole
time
and
listened
to
everybody
else.
i
think
the
jury
can
maybe
reason
from
that
in
deciding
which
witness'
testimony
they
want
to
give
the
greatest
credibility.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
defendant
has
to...
if
the
defendant
chooses
to
testify,
and
many
don't,
but
if
the
defendant
does,
the
defendant
has
to
try
to
be
as
credible
as
possible
on
the
facts
during
the
testimony,
but
i
would
have
thought
that
a
jury
could
consider
all
of
these
things
in
weighing
who
to
believe.
