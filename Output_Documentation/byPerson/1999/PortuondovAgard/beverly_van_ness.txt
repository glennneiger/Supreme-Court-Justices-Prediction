ms.
beverly
van
ness
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
just
would
like
to
focus,
if
i
can,
on
what
happened
in
this
case.
i
think
petitioner
has
made
concessions
in
their
briefs
that
are
really
dispositive
of
the
issues
in
respondent's
favor.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
has
conceded
many
times
in
their
main
brief,
which
i
think
they
properly
did,
that
an
affirmative
accusation
of
tailoring
was,
in
fact,
made
in
this
case.
in
their
reply
brief
and
again
here
at
oral
argument
they've
also
conceded,
as
i
think
they
must,
that
unless
you
have
actual
evidence
to
support
a
affirmative
accusation
of
tailoring,
that
you
can't
use
the
exercise
of
this...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
your
honor,
i
think
that
on
pages
2
and
3
of
their
reply
brief...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
if
i
may,
they
say,
nor
has
petitioner
alleged
that
a
tailoring
argument
may
be
predicated
merely
on
an
accused's
presence
during
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses,
and
on
page
3
on
the
first
full
paragraph,
at
no
time
has
petitioner
argued
that
a
tailoring
argument
may
be
built
on
nothing
more
than
a
defendant's
mere
presence
at
trial
during
the
taking
of
testimony.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
i...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
regrettably,
your
honor,
i
did
not
put
that
in
my...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
but
it
is
an
alternate
ground
for
affirmance,
your
honor,
and
i
think
these
concessions
are...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
your
honor,
going
to
the
opportunity
to
tailor
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
a
particular
point
on
that,
which
is
that
the
opportunity
to
tailor
argument,
the
quote,
mere
opportunity
to
consider
the
defendant's
ability
to
do
this,
is
really
an
invitation
to
the
jury
to
speculate.
you
have
at
best,
for
the
state,
you
have
two
inferences
that
could
be
drawn
from
a
consistent
story
by
the
defendant.
one
would
be
that
he
has
tailored
his
testimony
for
a
number
of
different...
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
only
one
of
which
might
be
the
presence
at
trial.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
certainly,
your
honor,
but...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
you're
calling
attention
to
evidence.
what
my
point
is,
that
this
is
not
evidence.
at
best,
this
is
a
possible
explanation.
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
defendant
tailored
his
testimony...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
my...
the
answer
to
that
would
be,
if
you
find
that
there's
evidence
of
tailoring
in
the
record,
jury,
you
are
free
to
consider
that
evidence,
but
not
that
you
are
free
to
consider...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
because
the
prosecutor
was
using...
the
only
evidence
was
that
the
defendant
was
there.
that
evidence...
that's
not
evidence
that
he
in
fact
used
the
opportunity.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
do
think
there's
a
danger
in
asking
the
jury
to
speculate,
because
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof,
but
if
a
line
is
to
be
crossed
here,
your
honor,
then
at
the
very
least
this
subject
must
be
raised
during
the
defendant's
cross-examination
to
give
him
the
chance
to
address
it.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
them
to
do
it,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
they
have
any
proof
that
that's
what
happened.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
your
honor,
i
just...
i
believe
that
that's
in
the
nature
of
an
adjective.
i
don't
think
that's
evidence...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
think
it's...
[laughter]
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
but
going
back
to
the
doyle
point,
your
honor,
the...
another
explanation
for
why
a
defendant's
story
is
consistent
and
he
can't
be
shaken
is
that
he's
telling
the
truth,
and
that's
why
this...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
that's
why...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
your
honor,
but
certainly
if
the...
the
prosecutor
is
free
to
use
anything
in
the
evidence
to
ask
the
jury
to
make...
to
draw
reasonable
inferences
from,
but
what
they
can't
do,
what
i'm
arguing
they
can't
do
is
to
ask
the
jury
to
speculate,
so
if
you
want
to
use
the...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
no,
i'm
certainly
not
advocating
that
position.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
certainly,
i...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
yes,
i
would.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
that's
correct.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
oh,
i...
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
no,
your
honor,
because
i
think...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
no.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
yes,
the
prosecutor
certainly
has
greater...
he
has
greater
latitude,
but
circumscribed
latitude.
the
arguments
that
are
made
must
be
fair
arguments
based
on
the
record.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
that
charge
and
the
issue
in
this
case,
because
the
motive
to
lie,
it's
not...
a
motive
to
lie
based
on
interest
has
not
been
presented
as
a
tool
that
the
defendant
has
which
gives
him
any
kind
of
advantage.
it's
a
charge
which
applies...
and
this
is
also
makes
a
difference.
it's
a
charge
that
applies
to
all
witnesses
at
trial,
not
simply
to
the
defendant,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
it's
not
using
the
defendant's
exercise
of
his
right
to
testify
against
him.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
think
that
comments
on
other
witnesses,
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
may...
might
be
appropriate.
those
other
witnesses...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
there
aren't
any,
going
to
be
any
such
witnesses,
but
if
there
are...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
all
right,
your
honor,
but
i
still
wouldn't
approve
that
kind
of
generic
construction,
because
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
the
defendant
to
use
his
exercise
of
a
right
against
him
without
any
basis
in
the
record.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
certain...
yes.
i
do
believe
that.
i
think
if
the
subject
comes
up
on
cross-examination
at
least
it
gives
the
witness
an
opportunity
to
address
the
issue,
and
to
proffer
any
kind
of
evidence
that
they
might
have
that
they
have
not
used
this
opportunity
to
their
advantage.
i
think...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
are
you
talking
about
the
defendant
or
ordinary
witnesses?
ms.
beverly
van
ness
oh,
i
think
it
would,
because
if
that's
all
that's
being
asked...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
mr.
defendant,
you
were
here
and
listened
to
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
right,
did
you...
did
that
give
you
an
opportunity
to
change
your
testimony,
that
that's
the
same
problem
as...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
that's
not...
that's
not...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
that's
not
directly
assailing
his
exercise
of
his
constitutional
right.
it's
not...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
it's
not
saying
that
the
defendant
got
an
advantage
out
of
that,
out
of
being
able
to
hear
that
testimony.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
think...
i
think
in
some
situations
you
could,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
in
this
situation,
because
i
think
that
the
value
that
the
state
could
get
out
of
such
an
argument
is
extremely
slight
compared
to
the
very
severe
burdens
that
are
placed
on
a
defendant
by
the...
by
being...
them
being
given
permission
to
raise
this
argument.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
don't...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
think
that
it's...
to
me,
that
question
shouldn't
be
asked,
because
i
think
it
has...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
yes.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
think
it's
doing...
it
has
the
same
difficulties
as
the
argument
that
was
made
on
summation
in
this
case.
it's
exactly
the
same.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
certainly
not.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
but
that
goes
back
to...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
your
honor,
that
goes
back
to
a
point
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier,
which
is
that
this...
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
there
is
not
evidence
that
he
tailored.
the
opportunity...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
the
question
of
whether
he
used
that...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
so...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
if
the
prosecutor
has
evidence
that
the
defendant
has
tailored
his
testimony,
i
am
not
saying
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
evidence.
he
can
use
it
on
cross,
and...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
for
example,
if
he'd
made
a
prior
inconsistent
statement,
and
he
changed
his
story
at
trial.
now,
again,
this
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
a
change
in
story
could
be
based
on
a
variety
of
explanations.
one
such
explanation
could
be
the
defendant
heard
the
witnesses
at
trial.
another
explanation
could
be
that
he
was
given
broad
discovery
rights,
knew
the
state's
evidence
very
well
before
he
got
in
there,
and
used
that.
another
possibility
is
that
he
is...
well,
so
there
are
several
explanations
for
why
he
could
have
changed
his
testimony,
and
listening
to
the
witnesses
is
only
one
explanation,
and
if
you
don't
have
evidence
that
that's
why
he
changed
his
story,
i
think
it's
unfair
to
ask
the
jury
to
assume
that
he
did.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
think...
yes,
because
this
explanation
doesn't
advance
their
case.
it's
the
evidence
of
the
change
that
advances
their
case,
not
the
explanation
for
it,
so
to
not
risk
them
drawing
an
unfair
conclusion,
and
to
not
burden
the
defendant's
exercise
of
his
constitutional
right,
i
think
this
argument
should
be
forbidden.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i'm
not
certain
i
follow
your
question,
your
honor.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
law
in
new
york.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
don't
think
this
constitutional
issue
has
been
addressed...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
think
it
is...
i
think
under
the
law
of
new
york
there
was
a
violation.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
there
were
many,
many,
many
issues
raised
in
the
appellate
division,
and
this
one
was
not
specific...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
if
this
is
permitted
by
the
law
of
evidence
in
the
state
of
new
york,
then
i
think
that's
an
unconstitutional
principle
that
this
court
can
address.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
prosecutor,
as
was
specifically
found
by
the
court
of
appeals,
actually
made
an
accusation
of
tailoring
against
the
defendant
on
the
basis
of
the
exercise
of
the
right
without
any
evidentiary
foundation
whatsoever.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
that
the
defendant's
story
is
consistent
doesn't
necessarily
mean
he
used
his
opportunity
to
hear
the
other
witnesses...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
no,
because
i
think
that's
not...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
the
prosecutor
went
much
farther
than
that,
your
honor.
he
went
on
to
say
that
my
client
received
a
great
benefit
and
advantage
the
other
witnesses
didn't
have,
and
attributed
his
consistency
to
the
exercise
of
his
right
to
be
present.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
precisely,
your
honor.
i
was
addressing
cross-examination,
but
i
did
want
to...
i
do
want
to
focus
back
on...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
because
if
it's
raised
for
the
first
time
in
closing
argument
it's
not...
it's
mere
speculation,
it's
not
evidence.
i
can't...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
it's
based
on
burdening
a
constitutional
right
with
no
legitimate
state
interest
advanced
by
that.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
the
state...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
your
honor,
i
think
it's
fundamentally
different.
the
state
here
is
seeking
to
use
the
defendant's
presence
as
evidence,
just...
they're
saying,
because
he
was
there,
you,
jury,
can
infer
that
he
lied.
that...
if...
at
least...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
it...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
what
is
the
jury
supposed
to
consider
in
the
deliberations
room
under
those
circumstances
if
there's
no
supporting
evidence?
the
prosecutor...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
i
don't
think
that
effectively
cures
the
problem,
because
the
prosecutor
is
not
merely
commenting
on
his
presence.
they're
commenting
on
the
fact
that
he
used
his
presence
as
a
tool
with
which
to
fabricate,
and
if
there's
no
evidence...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
then...
then,
if
there's
proof
of
that,
like
any
other
impeachment
evidence,
then
the
prosecutor
is
free
to
use
that.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
still
don't
think
that
the
jury
is
equipped
to
deal
with
this
situation,
because
there
is
no...
there's
no...
if
there's
no
evidence
before
them,
but
they're
being
told
that
if
you
consider
that
the
evidence,
that
the
defendant
has
used
his
opportunity
to
be
here
to
tailor,
then
you
consider
that.
it's
still
asking
them
to
consider
the...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
how
could
the
defendant
ever
rebut
that
kind
of
speculation,
though.
with
the
interested
witness
charge,
at
least...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
again,
the
interest
of
the
witness
is
neutral
in
a
sense,
because
not
only
does
it
apply
to
everybody,
but
it
is
not
perceived
as
a
tool
that
the
defendant
has
in
order
to
enable
him
to
tell
a
better
lie.
a
defendant's
interested
or
not,
and
if
he's
interested
you
can't
disbelieve
him
simply
because
of
that
fact.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
that...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
that
would
be
a...
that
could
be
a
due
process
violation
which
i
am
alleging
occurred
here,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
but
the...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
i
am
suggesting
that
a
prosecutor
can
always
make
a
tailoring
argument
in
summation,
a
tailoring
argument
in
summation,
if
there
is
evidence
to
support
it.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
but
what
i'm
getting
at,
your
honor,
is
i
don't
believe
it's
appropriate
ever
for
the
prosecutor
to
tie
that
tailoring
argument,
which
has
an
evidentiary
foundation,
with
the
defendant's
exercise
of
his
right
to
be
present.
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well...
ms.
beverly
van
ness
well,
that
would
be
a
due
process
violation,
your
honor.
