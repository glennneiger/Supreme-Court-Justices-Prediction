justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't
the
question,
mr.
zwerling.
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
seem
to
be
qualifying
it,
but
i'm
not
sure,
that
in
any
case
where
the
defendant
takes
the
stand,
so
he's
putting
his
credibility
in
issue,
in
any
such
case...
you
said
something
about
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
thought
your
position
was,
defendant
takes
the
stand,
the
prosecutor
legitimately
in
summation
can
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
please
take
into
account
that
defendant
was
the
only
witness
who
sat
through
this
entire
trial
and
therefore
could
conform
his
testimony
to
what
others
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
zwerling,
there
was
an
interested
witness
charge
in
this
case,
wasn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
is
doubling,
underscoring,
or
putting
it
in
bold
face,
for
one
witness
only.
the
interested
witness
charge
in
this
case
covered
the
defendant,
as
it
might
have
covered
other
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
in
answer
to
the
chief's
question
you
equated
the
two,
and
now
you're
telling
us,
well,
they
are
indeed
different,
and
you
are
entitled,
rightly,
to
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
that
point
the
second
circuit
disagreed
with
you
and
said,
if
there
had
been
in
this
case
an
attempt
to
show
that
particular
pieces
of
information
were
tailored,
so
be
it.
but
you
were
making
a
generic
claim,
and
you
answered
in
response
to
me
that
that
is
your
position,
that
in
every
case
where
the
defendant
takes
the
stand,
that
is
the
rule
the
prosecutor
can
bring
out
in
summation,
and
now
you
seem
again
to
be
retreating
from
that.
but
i
got
from
your
brief,
i
got
from
your
arguments
up
until
now
that
you
are
taking
that
position,
defendant
testifies,
it's
legitimate
for
the
prosecutor
to
bring
out
that
he
heard
all
the
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
in
new
york
a
defendant
has
no
right
to
bring
out
on
rebuttal
prior
consistent
statements
that
the
defendant
made
before
he
heard
the
witnesses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
when
would
that
be
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
nuechterlein,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
position
on
brief
that
chief
judge
winters'
distinction
was
unworkable,
because
it
seemed
to
me
the
second
circuit
worked
it
out
very
well
in
u.s.
v.
chako
the
next
time
the
issue
came
before
them,
when
they
said,
look,
it's
different
here.
here,
there
was
a
showing
of
tailoring,
not
merely
opportunity
to
tailor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
add
one
thing
to
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
we're
losing
what
the
second
circuit
decided.
as
i
understand
judge...
chief
judge
winters'
dispositive
opinion,
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether,
but
when.
he
narrowed
his
decision,
the
second
circuit's
decision
to
the
prosecutor's
springing
this
for
the
very
first
time
on
summation
and
distinguished
and
left
unanswered.
had
it
been
brought
up
on
cross,
when
the
defendant
would
have
a
possibility
of
rebuttal...
but
there
was
no
such
statement
made
in
the
cross-examination.
it
was
reserved
for
when
the
prosecutor
spoke
last,
and
that
was
all
that
the
second
circuit
addressed,
is
this
proper
to
make
on
summation,
and
we're
getting
into
cross-examine.
that
was
an
issue
that
the
second
circuit
explicitly
did
not
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
zwerling,
we're
going
so
far
beyond
what
the
second
circuit
decided.
they
didn't
talk
about
instructions
at
all.
they
spoke
only
about
what
was
proper
for
the
prosecutor
to
do
in
light
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
right,
given
the
second
circuit's
follow-up
decision,
in
which
they
pointed
out
that
when
that
happened
the
judge
repeatedly
offered
to
give
a
curative
instruction
simply
informing
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
not
only
a
right
but
an
obligation
to
be
there.
defendant
rejected
that
curative
instruction,
and
the
second
circuit
said,
too
bad,
but
then
the
distinction
between
the
defendant,
who
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
there
and
a
statutory
obligation
under
new
york
law
to
be
there,
that
distinction
is
presented
to
the
jury,
so
they
get
the
whole
picture
of
the
difference
between
the
defendant,
his
right
and
obligation,
and
other
witnesses.
