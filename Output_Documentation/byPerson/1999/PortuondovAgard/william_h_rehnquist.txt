chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
98-1170,
leonard
portuondo
v
ray
agard.
mr.
zwerling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
prosecutor
wouldn't
have
much
incentive
in
the
case
proposed
by
justice
kennedy.
i
mean,
that
argument
is
not
going
to
go
over
with
the
jury
if
you
say,
look,
this
guy
was
sitting
here
all
the
time
and
was
able
to
tailor
his
testimony,
and
yet
his
testimony
is
entirely
consistent
with
all
the
other
witnesses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
pretty
much
like...
i
think
you've
already
said,
like
the
trial
judge's
charge,
you
may
take
into
consideration
the
interest
of
every
witness
in
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings,
and
that
would
apply
to
the
defendant
as
well
as
to
any
other
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
there
witnesses
other
than
the
defendant
in
fact
sequestered
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
sequestered,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
reason
why
the
constitutional
doctrine
here
should
follow
the
niceties
of
the
law
of
evidence
on
when
you
can
impeach
witnesses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
zwerling.
mr.
nuechterlein.
do
you
pronounce
your
name
nuechterlein,
or
nuechterlein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nuechterlein,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
get
into
the
area
of
instructions
by
the
trial
court,
you
also
get
into
the
question
of
whether
a
defendant
would
request
a
particular
instruction.
i
know
when
i
practiced,
long
ago,
the
defense
attorney,
criminal
defense
attorneys
were
split
on
the
question
of
whether
it
was
an
advantage
to
the
defendant
to
have
the
judge
charge
that
he
was
not
required
to
take
the
stand
and
they
weren't
to
hold
it
against
him.
that
was
certainly
the
constitutional
law,
but
it
also
called
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
hadn't
taken
the
stand,
and
maybe
made
it
worse.
so
i
don't
think
you
should
think
in
terms
of
automatic
charges
by
the
judge.
often,
they
have
to
be
requested
or
could...
if
a
defendant
didn't
request
them,
they
wouldn't
be
given.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
doyle
facts
there
is
some
inconsistency
as
a
practical
matter
between
the
silence
at
the
time
of
questioning
and
the
contrived
story
at
the
time
of
trial,
but
here
there's
no
inconsistency,
there's
just
an
opportunity,
so
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
doyle,
and
i
didn't
agree
with
doyle,
as
you
may
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
ms.
van
ness,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
them
to
concede
that,
ms.
van
ness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
should
add,
we
don't
decide
cases
on
the
basis
of
concessions
by
the
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
rarely
go
off
on
alternate
grounds
for
affirmance
unless
there's
some
very
obvious
reason
why
we
can't
decide
the
issue
that
is
presented
in
the
question
presented,
which
is
whether
griffin
should
be
applied
to
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
prosecutor
surely
has
greater
latitude
than
a
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
traditional
charge
about
the
interested...
interested
party?
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
your
answers
to
justice
souter's
questions,
some
of
your
other
statements,
would
you
allow
that
to
be
given
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
that
the
defendant
was
not
telling
the
truth?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
the
defendant
had
been
sitting
through
all
the
trial
but
there
were
two
other
witnesses,
two,
for
some
reason,
who
had
also
sat
all
through
the
trial
and
had
not
been
sequestered...
all
the
other
witnesses
had
been
sequestered...
so
that
the
charge,
the
prosecutor's
comment
could
then
be
directed
to
two
witnesses
as
well
as
the
defendant.
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
generic
comment?
it
no
longer
singles
out
just
the
defendant.
it
singles
out
the
defendant
and
other
witnesses
who
have
sat
there
through
the
proceedings
and
not
been
sequestered.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i've
certainly
sat
in
cases
where
there
was
some
reason
for
a
particular
witness
not
to
be
sequestered,
and
it
wasn't
the
defendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
evidence
would
one
ever
get
that
the
person
had
tailored
their
testimony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
mere
fact...
even
the
mere
fact
that
he
changes
his
testimony
is
not
adequate
in
your
view.
you'd
have
to
show
that
he...
somehow
the
prosecutor
during
the
trial
would
have
to
show
that
he
changed
his
testimony
because
he
was
sitting...
he
was
sitting
there
and
heard
the
witnesses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
the
constitutionality
of
this
conduct
in...
under
the
griffin
analysis
depend
on
whether
it
was
brought
up
on
cross-examination
or
whether
it
was
urged
on
closing
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
constitutional
argument.
that
sounds
like
something
you
say,
the
prosecutor
shouldn't
do
that
because
it's
unfair,
and
griffin
isn't
based
on
unfairness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn't
your...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
van
ness.
mr.
zwerling,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zwerling.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
is
no.
98-1170,
portuondo
versus
agard,
and
here
the
respondent
was
convicted
in
the
new
york
courts,
of
anal
sodomy
and
third
degree
possession
of
a
weapon.
his
trail
ultimately
came
down
to
a
credibility
determination,
as
part
of
her
attack
on
his
credibility,
the
prosecutor
call
to
the
jury’s
attention,
the
fact
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
hear
all
other
witness
testify
and
to
tailor
his
testimony
accordingly.
the
trial
court
rejected
respondent’s
objection
that
these
comments
violated
his
right
to
be
present
at
trial.
after
exhausting
his
state
appeals,
the
respondent
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
relief
in
federal
court,
claiming
that
the
prosecutor’s
comments
violated
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
to
be
present
at
trial
and
confront
his
accusers
and
his
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
due
process.
the
district
court
denied
his
petition
but
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
ruled
for
the
respondent.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
scalia
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
second
circuit.
the
prosecutor’s
comment
did
not
violate
respondent’s
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
as
a
threshold
matter
respondent’s
claim
find
no
historical
support,
either
in
1791,
when
the
bill
of
rights
of
adopted,
nor
in
1868
when
according
to
our
jurisprudence,
the
fourteenth
amendment
extended,
the
structures
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
of
the
state.
respondent's
claim,
therefore
boils
down
to
a
request
that
we
extend
to
his
case,
the
reasoning
we
adopted
in
a
case
called
griffin
versus
california,
decided
about
20
years
ago.
there
we
held
that
at
trial
court’s
instruction
that
the
jury
could
consider
the
defendant’s
failure
to
testify
as
indication
of
his
guilt
unconstitutionally
burdened
the
defendant’s
privilege
against
self-incrimination
but
griffin
is
a
poor
analog
for
the
case
now
before
us.
it
prohibit
the
prosecution
from
urging
the
jury
to
do
something
that
jury
is
not
permitted
to
do.
upon
request,
a
court
must
instruct
a
jury
not
to
count
a
defendant’s
silence
against
him.
it
is
however
natural
and
irresistible
for
a
jury
in
evaluating
the
relative
credibility
of
a
defendant
who
testifies
last
to
have
in
mind
and
weigh
in
the
balance,
the
fact
that
he
has
heard
the
testimony
of
everybody
who
preceded
him.
we
hold
that
the
prosecutor’s
comment
also
did
not
violate
the
respondent’s
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
due
process.
the
respondent
argues
that
it
was
improper
to
comment
on
his
presence
at
trial
because
new
york
law
requires
him
to
be
present.
to
support
this
argument,
he
points
to
our
decision
in
doyle
against
ohio,
which
held
that
the
prosecution
can’t
impeach
a
defendant
with
his
silence
after
being
read
a
miranda
warning,
because
that
warning
we
held
carries
an
implicit
assurance,
that
silence
will
carry
no
penalty
but
no
promise
is
implicit
in
a
statute
simply
requiring
a
defendant
to
be
present
to
trail.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
