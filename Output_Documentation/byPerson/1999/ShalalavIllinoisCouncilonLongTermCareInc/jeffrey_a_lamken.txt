mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
medicare
act
provides
a
special
mechanism
for
judicial
review
in
section
405(d).
the
principle
that
governs
this
case
is
that
claims
that
can
be
raised
through
that
judicial
review
procedure
must
be.
section
405(h)
bars
efforts
to
circumvent
that
procedure
by
singling
out
particular
legal
issues
and
seeking
judicial
resolution
before
the
secretary
applies
those
rules
to
the
claimant
in
a
final
decision.
that
conclusion
flows
from
the
text
of
the
statute
and
this
court's
decisions
in
weinburger
v.
salfi,
heckler
v.
ringer,
and
bowen
v.
michigan
academy.
under
the
medicare
act,
nursing
homes
that
meet
the
secretary's
minimum
health
and
safety
requirements
may
voluntarily
enter
into
contracts
with
the
secretary
to
provide
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries.
the
medicare
act
makes
the
same
mechanisms
for
administrative
and
then
judicial
review
that
are
applicable
to
beneficiaries
also
applicable
to
nursing
homes
that
have
or
seek
to
enter
into
those
contracts.
in
particular,
section
1395cc(h)
provides
that
any
nursing
facility
that
is
dissatisfied
with
the
determination,
that
does
not
meet
the
minimum
health
and
safety
requirements,
and
is
subjected
to
a
remedy
as
a
result,
is
entitled
to,
first,
a
hearing
before
the
secretary
under
section
405(b)
and,
second,
to
judicial
review
of
the
secretary's
final
decision
following
that
hearing.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
structure
of
the
scheme
in
section
405(h)
specifically
exclude
preenforcement
review.
that
comes
from
the
language
of
section
405(h)
in
particular,
the
third
sentence
of
which
says
that
no
action
against
the
united
states,
the
secretary,
or
any
employee
shall
be
brought
under
the
general
federal
question
statute,
which
is
section
1331,
to
recover
on
a
claim
arising
under
the
medicare
act.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct.
as
the
court
noted
in
weinburger
v.
salfi,
the
secretary
typically
will
not
address
constitutional
claims
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
but
in
salfi
itself
there
was
a
facial
constitutional
challenge
to
a
provision
of
the
statute.
accordingly...
but
the
court
nonetheless
held
that
even
constitutional
claims,
facial
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute,
must
be
channeled
through
the
specific
review
mechanism
provided
by
the
act,
and
that
the
party
could
not
bypass
that
mechanism
by
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
under
the
general
federal
question
statute
in
advance.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
answer
is
yes,
although
we
don't
believe
that
this
case
presents
that
type
of
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
although
the
secretary
ordinarily
would
not
impose
termination
or
expose
medicare
providers
to
extreme
risks,
because
it's
a
voluntary
program,
they
don't
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
termination
is
an
extreme
remedy
that
is
reserved
for
the
most
extreme
circumstances
and
violations.
what
normally
occurs
when
a
provider
violates
the
statute
is,
the
secretary
or
the
surveyors
issue
a
letter
which
specifies
the
remedies
that
will
be
imposed
on
a
time
schedule,
including
denial
of
payments
after...
if
the
remedy
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
no,
but
the
ordinary--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's
true
that
the
absence
of
declaratory
relief
does
subject
them
to
some
risk,
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
there
is
an
extreme
risk
of
termination
for
a
provider
that
actually
does
nothing
more
than
preserve
his
right
to
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
could
not...
i...
we
would
consider
it
a...
the...
an
abuse
of
the
secretary's
decision
to
terminate
a
provider
for
doing
no
more
than
necessary
to
preserve
its
right
to
appeal.
what
the
provider
ordinarily
would
do
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--to
violate
the
statute,
draw
some
remedy,
and
then
the
secretary...
and
then
it
would
come
into
compliance
following
that
and
dispute
only
the
remedy,
and
if
a
provider
comes
into
compliance
shortly
after
the
remedy
is
imposed,
it
ordinarily
would
not
be
terminated.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
fact,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
risk
has
been
overstated
in
the
way
the
secretary
implements
it.
in
fact,
providers
do
not
have
to
risk
termination
in
order
to
bring
their
challenges,
but
this
is
about--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
judge
easterbrook
concluded
that
some
of
the
claims
were
unripe
for
that
reason.
in
fact,
because
it's
not
clear
that
any
of
the
regulations
will
ultimately
be
applied,
these
are
merely
enforcement
regulations
that
are
being
challenged,
not
anything
that's...
requires
the
providers
to
change
their
behavior
immediately.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i...
michigan
academy
we
don't
believe
is
passe
in
the
sense
that
for
the
category
of
claims
that
michigan
academy
identified,
claims
that
could
not
be
raised
through
the
express
judicial
mechanism,
but
for
which
congress
did
not
express
a
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
to
preclude
the
review
altogether,
that
remains
good
law,
and
that
remains
applicable
to
cases
that
fall
into
that
category.
what
congress
did
when
it
restructured
the
act
is,
it
took
one
particular
set
of
claims
out
of
that
category,
and
those
claims
were
challenges
to
the
methodology
used
in
determining
the
amount
of
part
b--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if,
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
construction,
your
honor,
would
place
michigan
academy
in
direct
conflict
with
ringer,
for
example,
heckler
v.
ringer,
for
example,
which
specifically
held
that
an
individual
may
not
slice
off
one
individual
issue
bearing
on...
one
individual
legal
issue
and
seek
its
resolution
in
advance.
what
the
court
did
in
michigan
academy
was,
it
distinguished
ringer
by
saying...
noting
the
respondent's
argument
that
it's
possible
to
construe
section
405(h)
as
not
applying
for
those
claims
that
can't
be
raised
under
its
neighbor,
section
405(g).
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
particular,
the
claims
that
were
at
issue
there
under
the
statute
as
it
then
existed,
but
when
congress
went
and
restructured
the
statute,
it
took
certain...
the
claims
that
were
at
issue
there
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
its
meaning's
changed.
the
only
ambiguity
the
court
noted
in
section
405(h),
without
discussing
the
language,
the
only
possible
ambiguity
it
noted
was
the
possibility
that
it
might
only
preclude
review
for
those
claims
that
can
be
raised
under
section
405(g).
if
that's
the
holding
of
the
michigan
academy,
and
that
is
the
only
ambiguity,
or
only
aspect
of
the
language
in
405(h)
it
addressed--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--to
the
extent
michigan
academy
addresses
the
language
of
section
405(h),
that
is
the
only
potential
ambiguity
identified.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
does
not
actually
hold
that
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
what
it
does
is,
it
first
says...
there's
two
possible
interpretations
that
are
posited
to
us.
the
government's
position,
that
it's
so
clear
that
it
bars
review
altogether,
and
respondent's
view,
which...
and
i'm
going
to
quote...
which
the
congress'
purpose
was
to
make
clear
that
whatever
specific
procedures
it
provided
for
judicial
review
of
final
action
by
the
secretary
were
exclusive,
and
could
not
be
circumvented
by
resort
to
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
the
court
then
went
on
and
said,
whichever
may
be
the
ringer...
better
reading
of
ringer
and
salfi,
we
need
not
pass
on
the
meaning
of
405(h)
in
the
abstract.
we're
not
going
to
address
the
language.
section
405(h)
does
not
apply
by
its
terms
to
part
b
of
the
program,
and
the
legislative
history...
and
then
it
went
into
the
legislative
history,
showing
that
congress
did
not
have
a
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
to
exclude
judicial
review
altogether.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
the
way
the
structure,
the
statute
is
structured
is
that
all
claims
are
channeled
through
a
review
in
the
administrative
agency.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct,
they
do
turn
on
that,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
weinburger
v.
salfi
could
not
have
been
decided
by
the
administrative
agency.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right,
but
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute,
and
they
sought
pure
declarative
relief
in
the
abstract
as
an
alternative
remedy,
could
not
be
decided
by
the
secretary.
it
was
identical
to
this
claim.
heckler
v.
ringer,
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
secretary's
rule,
that
it
was
promulgated
in
violation
of
the
apa,
and
that
the
rule
was
invalid.
that,
again,
was
not
something
that
an
alj
could
address,
yet
this
court
held
that
that
challenge
had
to
be
channeled
through
the
administrative
agency
and
be...
that
rule
could
only
be
challenged
on
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
agency's
final
decision
applying
that
rule
to
mr.
ringer.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
language
of
405(h)
is
clear,
and
that
as
the
court
applied
it
in
ringer
and
salfi,
any
claim
that
can
be
raised
through
405(g)
must
be.
in
michigan
academy,
this
court
recognized
in
the
fact
that
it
would
not
apply
the
literal
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right,
but
they
can
be
raised
on
judicial
review
through
405(g),
exactly
like
the
constitutional--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--although
the
secretary
would
never
be
able
to
impose
that
kind
of
rule,
because
participation
is
strictly
voluntary,
and
she
would
drive
all
the
providers
out
of
the
program
and
have
nobody
to
provide--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--but
assuming
the
argument
that
there
is
such
a
grossly
unreasonable
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--providers,
sometimes
the
absence
of
declaratory
relief
can
impose
difficult
choices
for
a
providers,
just
as
it
does
for
beneficiaries.
in
ringer,
for
example,
this
court
held
that
freeman
ringer
had
to
bring
his
claim
through
section
405(g),
even
though
he
asserted
first
that
he
could
not...
he
wanted
a
medical
procedure.
he
asserted
he
could
not
afford
it,
and
because
the
secretary
had
a
rule
providing...
prohibiting
payment
for
it,
he
claimed
that
he
could
not
obtain
the
procedure
absent
a
declaratory
ruling--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
two
things.
first,
i
should
note
that
there
has
been
no
presentation
in
this
case
that
that's
what's
missing
for...
under
405(g),
so--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
one--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--as
an
initial
matter,
that's
one
thing
they
would
have
to
do,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
would
be...
that's
a
necessary
but
not
a
sufficient
condition.
we
believe
we
also
have
to
violate
the
statute
and
then--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
right.
as
this
court
explained
in
ringer,
the
requirement--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--because
the
statute
provides
a
specific
mechanism
under
405(g),
and
that
mechanism
says
that
you
have
to
challenge
a
determination
by
the
secretary
that
you're
not
in
compliance.
that's
the
only
mechanism
for
bringing
review
under
the
statute,
and
the
statute...
as
heckler
v.
ringer
points
out,
this
is
not
merely
a
provision
that
requires
exhaustion.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
even
where
it's
ripe,
the
way
the...
because
of
the
enormous
size
of
the
administrative
program
and
the
enormous
number
of
potential
legal
issues
it
could
raise,
congress
established
a
system
where
all
challenges,
the
challenges
of
beneficiaries
and
the
challenges
of
medicare
providers
who
voluntarily
contract
to
the
secretary,
are
channeled
through
what
is
in
essence
a
quasi-adjudicative
system,
and
as...
you
get
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary,
and
that
is
how
you
challenge
the
rule,
is
by
challenging
the
final
decision
of
the
secretary.
for
example,--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct.
it
would...
if
it
were
a
ripeness
statute,
it
would
be
contrary
to
salfi;
mathews
v.
eldridge
as
well.
it
was
a
clear
procedural
challenge
thing
that
we
needed
predeprivation
review.
this
court
held
that
the
only
way
the
claim
could
be
raised
was
under
section
405(g).
now,
it
said
that
you
could
get...
you
could
determine
the
secretary's
denial
of
predeprivation
review
was
a
final
decision,
and
you
could
immediately
go
and
get
review
in
the
courts,
but
it
said
the
only
mechanism
for
review,
even
though
it
was
purely
procedural
and
clearly
ripe,
was
under
405(g)
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
i...
we
believe
that
it's...
the
statute
is
more
than
a
mere
exhaustion
statute.
it
channels
everything
through
a
quasi-adjudicative
process,
even
in
claims
like
freeman
ringer,
who
said
that
he
could
not
actually
channel
his
claim
thorough
the
administrative
process
because
he
couldn't
have
the
surgery
first
and
then
submit
a
claim
to
the
secretary.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
absolutely,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
exactly
our
position,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
congress
not
only
needed
to
channel
these
things
to
give
the
secretary
the
opportunity
to
eliminate
any
possible
way
of
avoiding
these
legal
issues
and
eliminate
overloading
the
courts
with
potentially
millions
of
claims
for
beneficiaries
and
nursing
homes
that
participate
alike,
but
it
also
ensures
that
all
the
claims
arise
in
the
most
concrete
factual
context
possible--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
as
the
secretary
implements
the
statute,
as
the
secretary
implements
these
requirements,
termination
is
only
imposed
as
the
first
remedy
when
serious
extreme
health
and
safety
requirements
are
violated,
when
basically
the
health
and
safety
of
the
beneficiaries--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
if
the
secretary's
procedures
did
place
them
in
such
an
extreme
consequence
that
it
violated
the
constitution,
for
example,
that
would
be
precisely
the
kind
of
claim
that
could
be
raised
under
405--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--only
in
the
context
of
a
specific
application,
yes.
there
would
be
two
opportunities
to
do
that,
your
honor,
i
should
point
out.
the
first
is,
if
the
person
immediately...
if
the
facility
immediately
corrected,
and
the
secretary
said,
because
you
immediately
corrected
i'm
not
going
to
impose
a
remedy
but
i'm
going
to
deny
you
a
hearing,
the
provider
could
say,
no,
because
you've
put
me
to
this
choice
that
i
had
to
correct,
you
coerced
me
to
correct,
you
have
to
give
me
a
hearing
even
though
there's
no
remedy,
the
constitution
requires
it,
that
claim
could
be
raised
under
405(g)
and,
in
fact,
that
claim
has
been
raised
under
405(g)
by
several
providers.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that...
congress
specifically--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
the
second
is,
if
it
would
violate
the
constitution,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
our
applying
405(h)
would
violate
the
constitution,
given
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
program.
but
a
court
would
always
have
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
to
decide
whether
applying
section
405(h)
would
violate
the
constitution
and,
obviously,
if
it
were
unconstitutionally
applied,
section
405(h),
because
it
put
the
providers
to
too
great
a
risk...
it
would
effectively
foreclose
judicial
review
altogether...
the
court
would
not
apply
405(h)
but
would
proceed
and
adjudicate
the
claim
directly,
but
we
should--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
to
recover
on
a
claim--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--to
recover
on
a
claim...
no,
we
don't.
to
recover
on
a
claim,
to
recover
simply
means
to
obtain
relief,
and
on
a
claim
means,
in
respect
to
a
legal
demand,
and
you
can
tell
that
it
doesn't
mean,
for
example,
to
recover
money,
because
congress
specifically
incorporated
that
provision
into
several
sections
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
recovery
of
monetary
benefits.
for
example,
it
incorporated
it
into
a
provision
that
has
to
do
with
excluding
providers
from
the
program
for
the
commission
of
certain
crimes,
which
would
be
section
1320a-7.
it
incorporated
it
into
provisions
that
have
to
do
with
imposition
of
civil
money
penalties,
so
it's
clearly
not
a
term
of
art
related
to
the
statute
that
means
the
recovery
of
monetary
benefits.
it's
also
clear
from
the
fact
that
even
when
congress
meant--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
language,
justice
breyer,
appears
in
1395cc(h).
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
that's
going
to
be
on
page
14,
15--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--okay.
and
that
language
basically
establishes
when
providers
are
entitled
to
review,
and
that...
it
states
that
the
provider
is
entitled
to
review.
if
the
secretary
determines
that
it's
not
a
provider
of
services,
which
means
that
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
health
and
safety
requirements,
or
there's
a
determination
described
in
subsection
(2)
of
the
section--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--which
are
certain
other
determinations.
now,
what
that
means
is,
the
way
you
can
get
into
405(g)
is
when
there's
a
determination
by
the
secretary.
absent
a
determination
by
the
secretary,
you
can't
get
through
405(g),
and
that
was
precisely
what
happened
to
freeman
ringer,
the
beneficiary,
and
he
could
not
get
through
405(g)
because
he
couldn't
afford
to
have
the
service
himself,
and
the
secretary
had
a
rule
that
barred
payment
for
the
procedure.
and
he
claimed
that
in
the
absence
of
declaratory
relief,
that
the
secretary's
payment-barring
rule
was
invalid
on
procedural
grounds.
he
could
not
have
the
surgery
and
could
never
submit
a
claim.
this
court
held,
nonetheless,
that
his
only
mechanism
for
review
of
the
rule
was
to
have
the
surgery
first,
submit
the
claim
to
the
secretary,
and
then
challenge
the
secretary's
refusal
to
pay
the
claim.
i
should
also
point--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
that's
not
correct,
for
two...
well,
first,
as
the
statute
was
initially
enacted
in
1939,
it
was
clear
that
to
recover
meant
to
get
money,
because
that
was
the
only
thing
at
issue,
was
merely
social
security
benefits.
but
as
incorporated
into
the
medicare
act,
it's
clear
that
to
recover
does
not
mean
to
get
money,
because
it's
incorporated
into
provisions
like
the
civil
money
penalties
provisions
and
the
exclusion
provisions
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
recovery
of
monetary
benefits,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
means
to
obtain
relief,
but
even
if
you
had
to
obtain
money
or
obtain
some
sort
of
benefit
or
entitlement,
the
court
interpreted
that
provision
in
ringer
as
precluding
parties
from
slicing
off
individual,
potential
legal
barriers
to
their
recovery
of
money,
or
to
recover--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no.
specifically--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
for
some
of
the
other
beneficiaries,
perhaps.
freeman
ringer
specifically
disclaimed
any
right
to
demand
that
he
get
a
judgment
entitling
him
to
the
procedure
at
issue
there,
or
payment
for
it.
all
he
did
was
seek
a
declaration
that
the
secretary's
rule
prohibiting
payment
for
that
procedure
was
invalid,
among
other
things
on
apa
grounds.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
that's
precisely
that
same
basis
here
under
1395cc(h).
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
any
time
there's
a--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--ringer
sought...
brought
a
preenforcement
claim
as
well,
and
he
sought
to
eliminate
one
particular
legal
barrier
to
his
potential
recovery.
that's
precisely
what
respondent
attempts
to
do
here.
it
is
challenging
the
secretary's
enforcement
of
the
requirements
of
participation.
the
secretary
cannot
pay,
and
cannot
allow
its
members
to
participate
in
this
program,
unless
they
meet
the
requirements
of
participation.
and
so
what
they've
done
is,
they've
singled
out
the
requirements
of
participation
and
said,
these
are
potential
legal
barriers
to
our
being
paid
and
to
our
participating
in
the
program,
and
they
have
attacked
them
preenforcement
to
try
and
eliminate
those
barriers.
that
is
precisely
what
freeman
ringer
did
with
respect
to
the
rule
that
prohibited
payment
for
his
procedure.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
that's
simply
a
matter
of
administrative
practice.
the
secretary
is
for--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
if
the
secretary
were
to
implement
the
statute
in
a
manner
that
was
unconstitutional,
or
an
extreme
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
that
would
be
reversible
error
i
believe,
yes.
