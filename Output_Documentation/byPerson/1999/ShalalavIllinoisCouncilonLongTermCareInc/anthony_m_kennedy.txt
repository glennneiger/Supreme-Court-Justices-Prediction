anthony
m.
kennedy
earlier
on
in
your
discussion
with
justice
souter,
in
answering
his
questions,
you
began
to
say
that
the
provider
need
not
risk
termination,
but
then
you
didn't
get
to
complete
that.
why
is
that,
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
reason
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
way
for
the
provider
to
test
termination
as
being
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
but
only
in
the
context
of
making
a
specific
claim
for
reimbursement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
that
part
of
your
prong,
then
the
only
way
he
can
avoid...
the
provider
can
avoid
the
risk
is
to
comply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
going
to
talk--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--tell
me
about
a
second
route
that
he
has.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
reading
any
claim,
to
recover
on
any
claim
as
a
term
of
art.
you
would...
would
you
concede
that
much?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
concede
even
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
suggest
no
limitations
for
your
theory.
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
indicates
to
me
that
if
we
rule
in
your
favor
the
current
regime
of
not
attacking
the
regulations
except
in
a
disputed
claim
will
be
completely
displaced.
i
see
no
limitation
on
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
secretary
have
any
record
of
wishing
to
cooperate
with
providers
for
little
test
cases?
