justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
first
part
of
what
you
read
referred
to
review
in
an
administrative
agency,
i
think,
and
there
is
no
such
review
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
claims...
all
of
these
cases
really
turn
on
the
meaning
of
the
words,
to
recover
on
any
claim
arising
under
this
subchapter
within
the
meaning
of
405(h),
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
have
been
held
to
be
such
claims,
and
some
have
not
been.
those
that
have
been
held
to
be
such
claims
are
all
claims
that
could
have
been
decided
by
the
administrative
agency,
and
this
is
not
such
a
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one
could
not
have
been
decided--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
claim
that
the
class
representative
in
salfi
had
been
presented
to
the
agency,
and
it
could
have
been
presented
to
the
agency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
on
behalf
of
the
whole
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
the
secretary
had
conceded
in
this
case
that
you
could
make
your
record
in
the
district
court.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'll
look
through
the
briefs
again.
