justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lamken,
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
text
of
the
sentence
that
you
referred
to,
is
dispositive,
so
that
there
would
be
some,
at
least
practical
point
to
this
question.
the
question
is
this.
is
it
possible
for
a
provider
who
wants
to
challenge
the
regs
as
vague
or
beyond
legal
authority
or
what-not
to
carry
that
challenge
all
the
way
through
to
the
point
where
they
could
be
heard,
i.e.
to
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
level
for
that
matter,
this
court,
without
risking
the
possibility
that
if
the
provider
loses,
the
provider
would
be
terminated,
or
subject
to
termination
by
the
secretary
as
a
provider.
is
it
possible,
in
other
words,
to
challenge
the
regulations
without
at
the
same
time
assuming
liability
for
the
most
draconian
of
possible
results,
which
is
exclusion
from
the
provider
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
matter
of
grace.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
secretary
may,
the
secretary
may
not.
is
there
a
way
for
this
kind
of
challenge
to
be
made
without
risk
that
the
secretary
may?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
may
i
interrupt
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
just
for
a
second?
i
take
it
from
what
you're
saying
that
the
secretary
could
right
up
front
say,
one
of
the
remedies
that
i'm
going
to
impose,
if
you
lose
at
the
end
of
this
process,
is
termination.
now,
if
the
secretary
did
not
say
that
up-front,
would
the
secretary
be
foreclosed
from
terminating
at
the
end
of
the
process
if
the
provider
lost?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
risk
would
always
be
there.
any
provider
would
know,
whatever
the
odds
might
be,
that
at
the
end
of
the
process,
if
the
provider
lost,
the
provider
in
effect
could
be
eliminated
from
the
benefit,
or
the
administrative
scheme
entirely.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
is
some
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we...
i
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
one
of
the
provider's
arguments
is
that
the
risks
can
be
so
extreme
that
there
really
isn't
a
proper
challenge
scheme
on
your
view
of
the
law,
because
any
provider
is
going
to
knuckle
under
rather
than
take
the
risk
of
being
terminated
at
the
end
of
the
day.
and
so
the...
i
think
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
would
say,
well,
sure,
we
may
commit
a
compliance
before
the
end
of
the
day,
but
the
reason
we
might
commit
a
compliance
is
that
the
risk
of
losing
is
not
merely
the
risk
of
losing
a
legal
challenge,
but
the
risk
of
losing
our
provider
status
entirely,
and
that,
in
fact,
they're
saying
is
not
a
legitimate
appeal
mechanism,
and
it
ought
to
influence
the
way
we
read
this
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lamken,
may
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
you
raised
the
point
that
you're
implying...
or
you're
using
the
language
of
(h)
as...
to
include
a
term
of
art.
as
i
understand...
and
you've
said,
of
course,
you're
not,
but
as
i
understand
it,
you're
reading
that
last
sentence
in
(h)
as
if
the
words
to
recover
were
not
even
there.
you'd
come
out
the
same
way
without
the
words
recover,
i
think,
because
the
statute...
the
sentence
would
then
read,
shall
be
brought
under
section
1331,
1336
of
title
28
on
any
claim
arising,
and
you're
reading
it
that
way,
as
if
the
words
recover
were
not...
the
words
to
recover
were
not
there,
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
why
i
think
you're
reading
it
as
if
the
words
to
recover
simply
were
not
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
ringer
also,
i
mean,
one
of
the
claims
in
ringer,
as
i
recall,
was
an
individual
benefit
claim,
so
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
was
also
a
procedural
basis
for
getting
him
the
relief
in
connection
with
a
claim
which
would
fall
under
the
natural
meaning
of
to
recover.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
don't
see
the
same
basis
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
preenforcement
claim.
there's...
the
word
to
recover
has
got
to
be
read
out
of
the
statute
to
make
this
particular
claim
fit
within
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
another
answer
you
gave
justice
kennedy?
you
mentioned
that
the
termination
remedy
was
reserved
for
quite
egregious
cases.
is
the
restriction
to
the
egregious
cases
in
a
regulation
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
matter
of
grace
by
the
secretary?
