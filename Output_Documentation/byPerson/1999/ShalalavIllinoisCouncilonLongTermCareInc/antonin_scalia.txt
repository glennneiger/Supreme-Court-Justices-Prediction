justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
i
didn't
understand
michigan
academy
to
be
written
that
way,
that,
you
know,
there
is
preenforcement
review
with
respect
to
those
claims
that
can't
be
challenged
otherwise,
although
there
may
not
be
with
respect
to
claims
that
can
be
challenged
otherwise.
i
mean,
i
think
we
were
interpreting
405(h)
and
1395ii,
and
we
said...
we
said
there
is
no
pre...
there
is
preenforcement
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
telling
us
that
there
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
of
no
change
in
the...
no
change
in
either
the
language
of
405(h)
or
the
language
of
1395ii.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
particular,
these
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
interesting
question
of
statutory
construction.
the
review
provision
in
michigan
academy
was
interpreted
a
certain
way
and,
it
said,
there
is
review.
now,
you're
telling
us
that
without
any
modification
of
that
section,
just
because
another
section
has
now
been
altered
to
allow
judicial
review
in
some
other
fashion,
the
section
now
has
a
different
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
that
the...
you
contend
that's
the
holding
of
michigan
academy?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say
that...
i
mean,
i
understand
that
that
was
its
rationale
for
the
interpretation
of
the
section,
but
does
it
say
in
so
many
words
that
the
section
only
permits
judicial
review
where
there
is
no
other
review
available?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
language
setting
forth
a
particular
manner
of
judicial
review
is
either
exclusive
or
it's
not
exclusive.
i
don't
know
how
we...
you're
putting
it
to
us
in
every
case
to
interpret
legislative
language
as
exclusive
in
some
cases,
not
exclusive
in
other
cases.
it's
too
much
of
a
headache.
if
congress
wants
to
amend
it
and
have
it
exclusive
in
some
and
not
exclusive
in
the
other,
it
can
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
admit
that
these
claims,
if
by
claim
you
mean
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint,
the
constitutional
issues
can't
be
raised
in
the
administrative
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
say
it's
just
an
exhaustion
statute,
either.
i
mean,
your
point
is
not
that
it
has
to
be
presented
to
the
secretary,
but
that
it
has
to
be
presented
in
this
unique
fashion
and
in
no
other
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
much
more
than
an
exhaustion
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
channeling
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
secretary
can
be
reversed
for
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
terminating
for
a
violation
that
couldn't
be
appealed
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
subject
yourself
to
it,
you
have
to
incur
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
that
you're
exposed
to
it.
what
you're
saying
is,
there
has
to
actually
be
a
termination
or
a
refusal
to
renew.
is
that
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
problem.
we
can
just
disagree
with
the
secretary
that
the
district
court
can't
take
evidence.
i
mean,
if
this
were
a
court
of
appeals,
i
can
understand
that
position.
but
you
have
a
district
court.
they're
used
to
taking
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
not
been
benevolent.
