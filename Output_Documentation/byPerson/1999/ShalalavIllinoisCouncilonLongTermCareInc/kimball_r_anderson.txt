mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
that
seems
to
be
troubling
the
court,
and
i
think
justice
souter
began
the
dialogue
with
the
question
this
morning
of
whether
it
was
possible
for
a
provider
to
make
a
challenge
to
the
regulations
or
the
secretary's
rulemaking
authority
without
suffering
a
termination,
and
mr.
lamken
initially
answered
that
question
yes,
and
then
he
said,
well,
maybe
no,
and
maybe
it's
discretionary.
i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
is
unequivocally
no
under
the
statute.
if
you
have
your
appendix
before
you,
on
page
14a
and
15a
of
appendix
a
to
the
secretary's
brief--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--the
petitioner's
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes,
the
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits...
we
see
that
on
page
15a
of
the
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merit,
on
the...
in
their
appendix,
we
see
under
section
1395cc(h)
that
this
is
the
really
only
route
for
a
provider
to
eventually
arrive
at
the
doorsteps
of
a
405(g)
court.
you
see
in
the
middle
of
that
paragraph
(h)(1),
and
to
judicial
review
of
the
secretary's
final
decision
after
such
hearing
as
provided
in...
as
such
hearing
is
provided
in
section
405(g).
now,
what
kind
of
determination
gets
us
there?
we
see
that
in
the
preceding
sentence.
there
has
to
be
a
determination
by
the
secretary
that
the
provider
is
not
a
provider
of
services...
in
other
words,
he's
not
even
in
the
class
of
institutions
eligible
to
participate...
or
(2)
a
determination
has
been
made--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--you're
correct.
there's
two
parts
to
that
first
sentence,
though.
it
says,
an
institution
or
agency
dissatisfied
with
a
determination
by
the
secretary
that
it
is
not
a
provider
of
services,
or
with
the
determination
described
in
section
(b)(2)
of
this
section,
shall
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
405(b)
and
to
judicial
review
under
405(g).
you
then
look
over
on
the
preceding
page,
which
we
see
on
page
14a
of
the
appendix.
we
see
that
under
(b)(2)
the
determination
there
specified
is
a
determination
that
the
secretary
has
refused
to
renew
a
provider
agreement,
or
has
terminated
a
provider
agreement
for
one
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
(2)(a),
(b),
or
(c).
that
statutory
language
we
believe
indicates
clearly
that
for
an
individual
provider
to
assert
the
kind
of
constitutional
challenge
here,
we
have
to
basically
fall
on
a
sword,
subject
ourselves
to
termination
or
extinction,
let
our
patients
be
displaced,
and
then
subject
ourselves
to
an
administrative
process
that--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--that's
right.
we
have
to
incur
it.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that
is
our
only
route
to
a
405(g)
court,
which
the
secretary
argues
is
our
adequate
remedy,
and
i
think
we
also
have
to
look
at
the
administrative
process
that
the
secretary
would
urge
we
have
to
be
channeled
through.
it
is
the
bizarre...
would
be...
it's
the
most
bizarre
administrative
review
process,
where
the
critical
factual
issues
are
not
heard,
the
issues
in
the
case
are
not
narrowed,
the
adjudicator
cannot
hear
or
adjudicate
your
claim,
and
where
the
adjudicator
has
no
particular
expertise
in
your
claim,
and
then
on--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think
the
government's
position
is,
first
of
all,
these
kinds
of
constitutional
claims
can
never
be
brought
by
a
trade
association,
so
we
would
get,
under
the
seventh
circuit's
view,
the
benefits,
the
resources--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
even
the...
even
our
members
cannot
individually
bring
this
claim,
because
this
claim
is
not
a
claim
for
benefits,
it's
not
a
provider
reimbursement
claim,
it
is
just
a
wholly
untethered--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
fact
that
at
least
one
member
has
been
injured
and
has
a
ripe
claim,
and
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
said
at
very
least
our
apa
claim
challenging
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
promulgated,
under
the
guise
of
a
state
operations
manual,
a
rule
that--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--no,
i'm
saying
that
the
secretary's
administrative
review
scheme
does
not
allow
this
kind...
there's
not
a
mechanism
for
us
to
bring
this
claim
before
the
secretary.
that's
why
we
believe
we
can
bring
it
directly
to
the
district
courts
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1331--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think
what
the
seventh
circuit
said,
that
the
apa
claim
was
ripe,
and
that
our
claim
that
the
regulations
effect
a
deprivation
of
rights
without
a
proper
hearing
of
the
timing
and
type
demanded
by
the
constitution
may
or
may
not
be
ripe,
and
remanded
that
back
to
the
district
court,
if
i
recall,
for--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
the...
here's
what
the
court
actually
said.
it
said,
to
the
extent
the
council
believes
that
the
regulations
fail
to
provide
predeprivation
hearings
at
the
time
and
in
the
form
the
constitution
demands,
the
claim
may
be
ripe
for
decision.
they
go
on
to
say
that
they're
going
to
leave
it
to
the
district
court
for
the
resolution
of
that
ripeness
issue,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
under
any
circumstance
the
apa-based
objection
to
the
adoption
of
the
manual
is
within
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
and
should
be
addressed
on
the
merits.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
as
a
matter
of
law,
yes.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
certiorari
was
not
granted
on
the
ripeness
issue,
but
i
think
that
we
clearly
do
have
a
ripe
claim
as
to
the
apa
objection,
and
as
to
the
remainder
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
is
correct
that
it
should
be
left
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
ripeness--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
we're--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think
the
response
to
that
is,
we're
really
by
that
issue
with
bowen
v.
michigan
academy,
with--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think
we're
really
talking
about
that
third
sentence
of
section
405(h).
the
court
in
bowen
v.
michigan
academy
squarely
held
that
the
government
was
contending
that
that
third
section
prevented
resort
to
the
ground
of
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
28--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
we
get
it
only
if
we
fall
on
a
sword,
and
let's
talk
about
what
type
of
review
we
get
under
section
405(g).
section
405(g)
courts
are
courts
of
very
limited
jurisdiction.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes,
i
am.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes,
i
am.
let's
assume
that
we
go
through
this
kind
of,
what
i
call
a
kafkaesque
administrative
proceeding,
where
the
hearing
officer
won't
hear
or
adjudicate
our
claim.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
didn't
read
it
that
way--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--your
honor.
i
just
read
it
to
say
that
our
apa
claim
was
ripe,
and
that
as
far
as
the
claim
that
the
regulations
provide...
fail
to
provide
predeprivation
hearings,
that
that
would
be
left
to
the
district
court
for
further
factual
resolution.
i
think
that
our
claim...
let's
take
our
apa--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--that's
correct.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that's
correct.
there's
two
pieces,
but
let's
take
the
apa
claim
for
a
moment,
and
let's
say
we
have
to
channel
that
through
the
administrative
exhaustion
mechanism
of
section
405(b).
now
we're
presenting
a
claim,
an
attack
on
the
validity
of
the
secretary's
rulemaking.
we're
presenting
it
to
an
adjudicator
who
has
no
expertise
in
the
area,
is
barred
by
the
secretary's
instructions
from
hearing
or
adjudicating
the
claim,
and
then,
after
we
go
through
this
kind
of
bizarre
procedure,
then
we
are
before
a
district
court,
theoretically,
after
we've
fallen
on
our
sword
and
been
terminated.
now
we're
before
a
district
court
that
is
vested
with
jurisdiction
only
under
section
405(g).
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
no,
it
wouldn't
please
me,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be...
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
justified
under
the
statutory
language.
i
don't
see
any
congressional
intent
to
split
off
those
kinds
of
claims,
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
statutory
structure
has
already
been
reviewed--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
let
me
talk
about
challenge
to
the
regulations
for
a
moment,
because
that
seems
to
be
a
concern.
the
regulations
that
the
secretary
is
adopted
we
were
challenging
in
part
because
they
preclude
even
administrative
review
of
significant,
potentially
harmful
events
to
our
members.
they
preclude
review
of
certain
survey
and
enforcement
determinations,
including
the
issuance
of
deficiencies
without
a
remedy,
they
preclude
any
administrative
review
of
the
government's
choice
of
remedy,
so
you
get...
you
can
get
terminated,
or
you
can
get
fined,
or
you
could
have
state
monitoring.
you
have
no
latitude
or
permission
by
the
secretary
to
challenge
the
choice
of
remedy,
and
there
is
no
administrative
review
regarding
the
determinations
regarding
the
level
of
noncompliance.
we
say
that
these
regulations
are
beyond
the
secretary's
statutory
authority,
and
are
also
unconstitutional.
now
let's
say
we
are--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
that's
an
interesting
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
secretary
can
allow
us
to
participate
and
then
inflict
reputational
injury,
which
i'll
talk
about
in
a
moment,
and
other
harm
without
a
predeprivational
hearing.
one
of
the
reputational
harms
we
allege
is
the
fact
that
these
determinations,
which
i've
outlined
here,
and
that
are
nonreviewable
in
certain
circumstances
unless
you
fall
on
a
sword,
have
to
be
published.
they
stay
on
your
record.
they
have
to
be
put
on
a
web
site.
they
have
to
be
posted
to
the
state
agencies.
they
have
to
be
posted
to
residents
and
patients.
the
secretary's
agents
are
allowed
to
characterize
the
institution
as
a
poor
performing-facility,
or
a
deficient
facility,
and
we
have
alleged
that
these
kinds
of
events
causes
reputational
injury,
financial
injury,
which
the
secretary,
by
her
instructions
to
her
agents,
has
prohibited
any
kind
of
administrative
review
unless
you're
willing
to
fall
on
the
sword
and
suffer
a
termination.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
think
the
limitation
is
the
one...
you
know,
i
think
the
scheme
that
i
propose
is
the
one
that
congress
has
intended,
that
when
you
have
a
statutory
or
constitutional
challenge
to
the
secretary's
rulemaking
or
regulations
that
is
completely
untethered
to
a
claim
for
benefits,
or
completely
untethered
to
a
claim
for
provider
status,
termination
or
nonrenewal,
then
those
types
of
claims
do
not
have
to
be
channeled
through
the
secretary's
administrative--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--the
standing
is
the
fact
that
these
rules
and
regulations
that
i've
described
are
actually
being
enforced,
and
they
are
actually
causing
harm
to
our
members.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes.
you
tether
it
to
a
termination.
you
fall
on...
the
provider
says,
okay,
i'm
just
not
going
to
comply
with
this.
i'm
going
to
suffer
a
termination,
and
then
i
will
tether
it
to
a
termination
claim
under
section
1395cc(b).
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
no.
i
would
not
agree
that
we
could
bring
that
without
suffering
any
injury,
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint
and,
indeed,
we
submitted
to
our
district
court
evidence
in
the
form
of
affidavits
of
actual
injury.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
think
the
answer
is
that
ringer
itself
and
its
progeny
has
characterized
that
case
as
one
that
is
at
bottom
a
claim
for
benefits,
so
there
you
had
a
claim
that
was
not,
as
i
said,
totally
untethered
from
an
individual
claim
for
benefits.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
this
is
the--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
for
the
reason
i
attempted
to
address
at
the
outset,
which
is,
civil
monetary
penalties
are
not
reviewable
by
a
section
405(g)
court.
to
get
to
a
section
405(g)
court...
i'm
using
that
to
refer
to
the
judicial
review
described
in
section
405(g)
of
the
social
security
act.
you
only
get
there,
for
a
provider,
through
section
1395cc(f).
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes,
but
as
i
read
that,
there
have...
paragraph
(2)
goes
hand-in-hand
with
(a),
(b),
(c).
in
other
words,
you
have
to
have
a
refusal,
or
a
renewal,
or
a
termination
after
the
secretary
has
made
one
of
those
determinations.
do
you
see,
your
honor,
the
words,
after
the
secretary?
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
okay.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes.
well,
the
whole
thing
is
very
dead.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
but
you
know,
that's
exactly
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
in
the...
in
its
decision
in
michigan,
the
michigan
association
case
that
is
the
other
half
of
the
split
that
brought
us
here,
the
michigan
association
case.
there,
the
court
candidly
acknowledged
that
the
practical
difficulties
that
the
nursing
homes
face
is
pretty
much
the
same
catch-22
that
the
supreme
court
addressed
in
mcnary
v.
haitian
refugee,
and
they
said
that
that
really
didn't
trouble
them.
we
are
confident
that
at
least
one
of
its
members
will
find
a
test
case
worth
pursuing
through
which
the
association's
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
have
been
heard.
i
say
that's
ridiculous,
and
bad
policy,
that
without,
you
know,
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
statute,
we
would
arrive
at
a
conclusion
urged
by
the
secretary
where
our
member...
we
cannot
bring
these
claims
at
all
through
an
association,
and
our
individual
members
can
only
bring
them
if
we
fall
on
our
sword.
we
put--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--i
think
for
mr.
salfi,
he
had
come
to
the
end
in
the
sense
that
he
had
been
finally
denied
the
benefit
he
had
claimed
but,
to
be
sure,
your
honor
is
correct
that
he
had
not--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--you
may
be
right.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
she
had
not
completely
exhausted
her
administrative
remedies,
and
the
court
said
that
exhaustion
could
be
excused.
it
was
discretionary
with
the
secretary.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--yes,
i
do
have
some
other
concerns,
because
the
normal
kind
of
exhaustion
requirements
are
bizarre
as
applied
to
this
situation.
we...
the
secretary
would
have
us
incur
the
expense
and
time,
which
often
takes
months
or
years,
to
go
through
an
administrative
process
where
the
hearing
officer
alj
is
barred
from
hearing
our
evidence,
commenting
on
it,
or
adjudicating
it.
and
then,
as
i
was
trying
to
explain,
if
we
go
through
that
process
without
an
adjudication,
without
any
fact-finding,
without
any
clarification
of
the
issues,
now
we
finally
have
the
right
to
review
under
a
district
court--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--okay.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
don't
know,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
history
of
the
secretary
being
so
benevolent.
i
also
want
to
comment,
if
i
may...
you
said
do
i
have
any
additional
concerns,
and
i've
tried
to
articulate
the
falling
on
the
sword,
the
futility
of
the
administration
of
the
exhaustion
remedy,
but
i
have
an
additional
concern
about
the
constraints
that
section
405(g)
puts
on
a
district
court
when
one
of
these
claims...
hypothetically
it's
now
gone
through
months,
if
not
years.
now
this
claim
arrives
at
the
doorsteps
of
the
district
court
vested
with
jurisdiction
only
under
section
40...
405(g).
that
court's
hands,
i
would
suggest,
are
really
tied.
that
court
is
sitting
as
basically
a
court
of
review.
section
405(g)
says
it
may
affirm,
modify,
or
reverse
the
secretary's
decision.
the
secretary
herself
has
taken
the
position
that
the
district
courts,
sitting
pursuant
to
section
405(g),
have
no
fact-finding
ability,
that
they
are
sitting
literally
as
courts
of
appeal.
she
took
that
position
in
a
case
called
grant
v.
shalala.
it's
a
third
circuit
decision,
and
the
third
circuit
sustained
the
secretary's
position,
finding
that
the
district
courts
had
no
fact-finding
ability.
the
district
court
then
is
presented
with
an
inadequate
factual
record,
because
the
alj
couldn't
hear
it,
and
the
district
court,
if
you
read
405(g)
literally,
can
only
remand
to
the
secretary,
that
as
we
know
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
nelconyan
case,
its
powers
to
remand
are
very
limited.
it
can
remand
only
if
the
claimant
has
presented
new
evidence,
and
by
count
of
a
rule
60
burden
has
to
demonstrate
that
the
new
evidence
didn't
exist
and
couldn't
have
been
presented
to
the
secretary,
and
that
good
cause
exists
for
not
presenting
it
to
the
secretary
on
the
way
up
through
the
administrative
process.
so
i
would
suggest
that
first
of
all
we
have
the
falling
on
the
sword,
then
we
have
the
futility
of
presenting
your
claim
to
an
alj
who
won't
hear
it
or
rule
on
it,
and
then
you
get
to
a
court
who
the
secretary
has
persistently
maintained
has
very
limited
powers
to
sit
merely
as
a
court
of
review.
i
suggest
that
that
is
absurd,
to
impute
that
intent
to
congress
with
nary
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--i
haven't
heard
that
concession
from
the
secretary.
i
think
that
she's
certainly
taken
the
position
in
other
cases
that
the
district
court
is
constrained.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes,
but
how
can
the
district
court...
the
district
court
is
going
to
be
constrained,
because
sitting
as
a
court
of
review,
it
is
not
going
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
a
fully
developed
factual
record
that
may
be
necessary
to
resolve
the
constitutional
claim
and
so
you
have
kind
of
a
bizarre
ping
pong
match,
where
the
case
comes
up
to
the
district
court
without
an
adequate
record
and
the
district
court,
trying
to
comply
with
405(g)
and
this
court's
decision
in
nelconyan,
says
well,
i
have
to
remand
it
to
the
secretary's
alj
who--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--can't
hear
the
claim.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
you
could.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
secretary
herself
has
blocked
us
at
the
outset,
in
the
middle,
and
at
the
end.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i'd
like
to
just
comment
briefly,
before
i
sit
down,
on
one
final
point
about
whether
or
not
bowen
v.
michigan
academy
has
any
remaining
vitality,
or
has
lost
its
precedential
force.
the
secretary
suggests
that
it
does.
i
suggest
that
if
that's
the
case,
i
think
that
point's
been
lost
on
this
court,
which
has
repeatedly
cited
it
for
the
proposition
that
i
think
it
stands
for,
that
section
405(h)'s
preclusive
effect
does
not
reach
to
collateral
challenges
to
the
validity
of
the
secretary's--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--yes.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes.
i
think
the
linchpin
of
the
decision
was
a
straightforward
statutory
construction.
i
don't
believe
the
linchpin
was
the
presumptions,
or
creating
an
exception
to
the
statute,
because--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--thank
you.
