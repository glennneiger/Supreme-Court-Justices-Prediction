mr.
lamken,
i
guess
what
respondents
really
want
is
preenforcement
review
of
the
regulations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
possible,
in
your
view,
under
this
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
what...
in
your
view,
the
nursing
homes
have
to
wait
for
a
deficiency
citation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
they
then
try
to
raise
administratively
some
constitutional
claim,
for
example,
about
the
regulations,
that
can't
be
decided
administratively
before
the
level
of
the
secretary,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
order
to
present
a
claim,
they
have
to
violate
the
statute
and
present
it
to
the
secretary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
where
members
of
the
court
are
a
little
hung
up,
why
you
have
to
do
both.
why
isn't
it
enough
to
just
go
to
the
secretary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
petitioner's
brief?
