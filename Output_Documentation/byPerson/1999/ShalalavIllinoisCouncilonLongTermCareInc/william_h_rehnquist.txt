justice

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
98-1109,
donna
shalala
v.
the
illinois
council
on
long
term
care.
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
anderson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
petition
or
the
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
petitioner's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
previous
sentence.
it
looks
like
all
one
sentence
to
me.
am
i
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
how,
then,
does
an
association
get
the
right...
i
thought
associational
standing
depended
upon
the
right
of
at
least
one
member.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
one
of
your
answers
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
was
that
your
members
could
not
have...
no
individual
member
could
have
brought
this
claim.
was
i
wrong
in
thinking
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
now
about
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
the
seventh
circuit
said
they
just...
they
didn't
know
enough
about
it
to
agree
with
you
or
not,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
you
read
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
notice
and
comment
claim
is
really
out
of
the
mainstream
of
this
kind
of
litigation.
in
other
words,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
government's
fear
is
that
we're
going
to
have
a
whole
lot
of
notice
and
comment
claims
go
to
the
district
court.
it's
the
substantive
challenges
to
the
regulations
that
are
the
real
problem,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
one
could
split
off
the
notice
and
comment
claim
from
the
rest
of
the
things,
and
i'm
sure
that
wouldn't
please
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
rely
on
the
notice
and
comment
claim,
you're
putting
the
administrative
procedure
in
its
least
appealing
light,
it
seems
to
me.
i
mean,
certainly
i
thought
the
seventh
circuit
said
we
just
don't
know
how
the
review
procedure
will
go,
because
these
things
are
brand
new,
on
the
substantive
claims.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
they
be
unconstitutional?
i
mean,
your
client
is
free
to
run
the
nursing
home
and
give
up
the
federal
support.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
a
claim
is
completely
untethered,
what
is
the
standing
to
bring
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
that
suggests
that
there
may
be...
might
be
someone
who
could
bring
a
so-called
tethered
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
argument
is
that
you
should
bring
what
you
call
an...
you
can
bring
what
you
call
an
untethered
claim,
that
without
having
suffered
any
injury,
kind
of
an
advanced
declaratory
judgment,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1109
shalala
versus
illinois
council
on
long
term
care
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
