justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lamken,
as
i
read
judge
easterbrook's
opinion,
he
essentially
agreed
with
what
you're
saying
now,
but
he
put
it
on
a
ripeness
point.
he
said,
these
regulations
are
brand
new.
we
don't
know
how
they're
going
to
be
applied.
we
don't
know
what
the
secretary
will
do,
and
we
don't
know
whether
a
court
might
say,
at
the
end
of
the
line,
that
what
the
secretary...
he
said
they
need
fleshing
out.
so
i
think
on
this
point
judge
easterbrook
said,
well,
they
won
this
victory,
but
they
may
lose
the
war,
because...
well,
they
may
even
have
no
permanent
victory
here
because
of
the
ripeness
question,
that
the
regulations
have
been
untried,
untested.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
something
to
the
point
that
the
seventh
circuit
made
that
michigan
academy,
that
what
you
are
essentially
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
declare
michigan
academy
passe
because
part
b
regulations
are
now
subject
to
judicial...
part
b
rulings
are
subject
to
judicial
review.
if
that
had
been
the
case,
michigan
academy
never
would
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was.
but
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
said,
that
michigan
academy
stands
in
the
way
of
cutting
out
altogether
preenforcement
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
made
it
ripeness,
that
would
certainly
be
contrary
to
salfi,
because
salfi
was
a
fully
ripe
claim,
and
the
court
said
you
couldn't
do
it
under
1331,
even
though
it's
clear
that
the
secretary
cannot
rule
on
the
only
issue
in
dispute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
anderson,
on
this
argument,
the
seventh
circuit
said,
well,
we
don't
know
about
any
of
that.
these
regulations
are
hot
off
the
press.
we
have
no
idea
how
they're
going
to
be
applied
and
interpreted.
so
what
you're
describing
is
something
that
may
be,
but
maybe
not,
and
my
question
to
you
is,
is
there
really
a
significant
difference
between
the
seventh
circuit's
bottom
line...
that
is,
your
vagueness
challenge,
your
not-possible-to-administer-equally
challenge...
that
they
wouldn't
hear
any
of
those
claims
because
they
were
not
ripe.
is
the
bottom
line
significantly
different?
what
do
you
get
from
the
seventh
circuit
decision,
apart
from
the
manual,
that
would
be
different
if
the
government
had
prevailed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
members
could,
and
you
could
join
your...
you
could
then
intervene,
so
that's
not
a
large--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
isn't
responsive
to...
my
question
is
that
the
seventh
circuit
said,
we're
not
going
to
throw
you
out
because
you
sued
under
1331,
but
we're
not
going
to
listen
to
your
claim
about
vagueness,
we're
not
going
to
listen
to
your
claim
predicting
inconsistent
application,
because
we
don't
know
how
these
things
are
going
to
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
was
exactly,
an
industry
subject
to
a
battery
of
new
regulations
cannot
ask
for
an
all-at-once
review,
but
must
wait
until
the
agency
has
worked
through
the
process
in
administrative
adjudication.
that
sounds
like
most
of
what
you're
complaining
about
you
could
not
bring
before
the
court
now
on
ripeness
grounds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
only
claim
that
they
said
was
ripe?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you
refer
to
as
your
apa
claim,
to
be
clear
on
what
that
was,
was
that
the
manual...
you
contended
that
the
manual
required
notice
and
comment,
and
there
had
been
no
notice
and
comment,
so
that
was
a
discrete,
concrete
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unlike
your
prediction
of
how
these
hearings
would
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
differ
from
the
situation
of
the
one
plaintiff
in
ringer
who
said,
i
can't
have
post-review
because
i
haven't
got
the
money
to
get
the
procedure
and
be
denied
the
benefit,
so
i
want
an
up-front
declaratory
ruling
that
i'm
entitled
to
reimbursement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
question
of
cooperation,
salfi
itself
was
an
example
of
that,
wasn't
it,
because
as
i
understand
that
claim,
it
hadn't
gone
the
entire
administrative
route,
but
the
court
said,
the
secretary
can
waive
the
exhaustion
part
of
it.
what
can't
be
waived
is
going
in
that
405
(g)
and
(h)
door,
but
they
hadn't
come
to
the
end
of
the
line
before
the
administrator
in
salfi,
and
yet
the
court
said
that
judicial
review
under
405(g)
and
(h)
would
be
okay
if
the
secretary
waives
going
through
to
the
end.
isn't
that
correct
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
there
was
cooperation
to
that
extent
in
salfi?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
had
not.
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mrs.
salfi.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
to
questions
over
which
the
secretary
has
no
confidence,
like
constitutional
questions,
then
the
district
court
is
the
first
instance
decider.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
the
court
would
have
reached
that
conclusion
if
part
b
determinations
had
been
subject
to
judicial
review
the
way
part--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--d
were?
