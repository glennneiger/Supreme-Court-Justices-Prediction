mr.
kevin
m.
schad
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
does
not
argue
that
it
should...
that
the
respondent
should
have...
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
its
pound
of
flesh
in
this
case.
the
problem
with
this
case
has
always
been
that
the
government
has
always
sought
3
pounds
of
flesh
where
it's
only
entitled
to
1.
if
you
look
at
the
procedural
history
of
this
case,
the
government
argued
for
two
consecutive
924(c)
charges
which
were
later
overturned
by
the
sixth
circuit
en
banc
court.
the
original
sentence
in
this
case
was
171
months'
imprisonment
with
the
3-year
supervised
release.
upon
the
bailey
case
we
filed
the
2255
motion
and
were
able
to
overturn
the
other
conviction,
the
924(c)
conviction
in
this
case,
but
the
government
has
always
consistently
sought
in
this
particular
case
to
obtain
more
than
which
they
are
entitled
to.
if
i
can
address
justice
o'connor's
question
to
the
united
states
with
regards
to
the
relief
that
the
united
states
is
seeking
in
this
case,
the
request
for
relief
in
this
case
is
somewhat
vague
in
that
the
united
states
doesn't
address
how
it
is
entitled
to
a
particular
kind
of
relief
in
this
case.
if
you
take
the
united
states'
position
that
supervised
release
began
to
run
in
may
of
1996,
then
in
may
of
1999
of
this
year,
supervised
release
will
have
ended
whether
or
not
he
was
actually
on
supervised
release
or
not.
there
is
no
statute
which
says
that
the
period
of
supervised
release
is
tolled
for
the
time
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
case
and
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--in
may
of
1996
there
was
a
bond
hearing
and
judge
gilmore
of
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
at
that
point
overturned
the
924(c)
conviction.
he
was
released
on
that
date,
may
2,
1996.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
and
the
government's
position,
united
states'
position
has
been
that
supervised
release
began
to
run
on
that
day,
so
if
you
take
that
starting
date
and
play
that
out
for
the
entire
3
years,
then
even
now
the
united
states
is
not
entitled
to
any
relief
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
well,
in...
justice
scalia,
in
fact
the
sixth
circuit
did
overturn
the
portion
of
his
supervised
release
in
its
decision
of
august
of
1998,
and
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
was
transmitted
up
to
the
probation
officer
and
in
fact
he
has
not
been--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--the
probation
officer
has
not
been
supervising
him
since
august
of
1998.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
the
government,
the
united
states
did
not
seek
to
stay
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
pending
this
court's
decision,
so
in
fact,
even
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
in
cases
under
3624(e)
the
term
of
supervised
release
only
begins
to
run
on
the
day
they're
actually
released
from
prison,
we
would
argue
that
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
in
this
particular
defendant's
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes.
to
answer
you
question,
justice--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--to
answer
your
question,
justice
breyer--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--even
if
there
were
no
conditions
of
supervised
release
for
that
term
of
the
year
that
this
particular
defendant
would
have
to
wait
until
supervised
release
was
then
terminated,
he
still
has
the
problem
of
if
he
would
commit
another
crime
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
probation
officer
he
then
can
be
brought
up
for
supervised
release
revocation
and
be
given
the
entire
3
years
of
supervised
release
at
any
time
during
that
1
year,
so
even--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--well,
justice
breyer,
in
that
situation
i
don't
know
if
crimes
a
and
b
are
necessarily
related
to
each
other.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
okay.
as
a
good
defense
lawyer
i
would
argue
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
fine
back.
i
would--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--i
do
not
believe--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes.
i
do
not
believe
that
i
could
find
support
for
that
under
the
law
but
certainly
i
would--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--certainly
i
would
make
that
argument.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
in
supervised...
in
the
time
spent--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--okay.
in
taking
the
present
case
and
applying
it
to
those
circumstances,
we
have
a
situation
where
unless
this
particular
defendant
gets
credit
off
of
his
supervised
release
for
the
time
that
he
spent
in
prison,
he
has
no
basis
to
obtain
relief
for
the
time
that
he
had
spent
in
prison.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
i--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--i
do
understand
your
question,
justice
breyer,
and
i
don't
know
that
i
have
an
adequate
answer
for
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes.
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
other
way
in
this
particular
case,
returning
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
defendant,
there
is
no
other
way
to
provide
him
with
some
relief
for
the
time
that
he
has
spent
in
prison.
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
in
fact,
when
imposing
a
term
of
supervised
release
under
the
guidelines,
the
court
is
to
look
at
the
severity
of
the
offense.
there's
classes
of
felonies
that
are...
there's
a,
b,
c,
and
d
type
class
felonies,
and
depending
upon
the
severity
of
the
felony,
that
in
turn
makes
the
minimum
supervised
release
term
larger.
so
in
fact
the
sentence
itself,
or
the
crime
itself
does
have
a
bearing
on
supervised
release,
and
although
the
respondent
would
admit
that
there
are
some
rehabilitative
aspects
of
supervised
release,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
converse
is
not
also
true,
in
that
incarceration,
although
it's
punitive
in
nature,
does
also
have
aspects
of
rehabilitation.
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
a
defendant
can
obtain
his
ged
while
he's
incarcerated,
he
can
obtain
a
trade,
he
can
work
in
unicor
and
obtain
a
trade
that
way,
or
he
can
go
to
a
specialized
vocational
school,
he
can
take
classes
such
as
family
parenting
and
different
classes
like
that,
so
in
fact
incarceration
is
also
rehabilitative
in
and
of
itself
also,
so
the
mere
fact
that
supervised
release
is
not
solely
punishment
does
not
mean
that
you
cannot
give
credit
one
for
the
other
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
i
am
confident
that
the
defendant
would
have
certainly
wanted
to
take
the
2-1/2
years
and
served
it
on
supervised
release
rather
than
be
wrongfully
incarcerated
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
justice
souter,
in
this
particular
case,
and
with
these
particular
facts,
i
would
agree
that
congress
has
spoken
in
those
two
particular
areas,
but
in
fact
congress
presupposes...
when
it
writes
as
to
those
issues
it
presupposes
both
a
valid
conviction
and
a
valid
term
of
supervised
release.
if
you
look
at
3624(a)
and
3624(e),
both
of
those
presuppose
that
there
is
a
valid
term
of
conviction
and
a
valid
term
of
supervised
release.
i
would
submit
that
congress
never
considered,
and
in
fact
the
sixth
circuit
also
agreed
with
this--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--as
to
the...
yes,
as
to
the
drug
offenses
he
does
have
a
valid
conviction,
but
as
to
the
924(c)
counts,
it
was
not
a
valid
conviction
when
it
was
originally
imposed
by
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
no.
no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes,
they
would,
until
the
government
would
bring
him
into
court
and
request,
i
guess,
anticredit--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
the
bottom
line
in
this
case
is
that
the
court...
the
united
states
is
reading
3624(e)
and
reading
that
sentence
alone,
and
states
that
the
congress
was
clearly
unambiguous
when
it
wrote
3420...
3624(e).
if
you
look
at
petitioner's
appendix
26a,
where
it
puts
the
entire
3624(e)
in,
if
you
look
at
the
last
sentence
of...
of
3624(e),
it
states
that
no
prisoner
shall
be
released
on
supervision
unless
such
petitioner...
prisoner
agrees
to
adhere
to
an
instalment
schedule,
not
to
exceed
2
years
except
in
special
circumstances,
to
pay
for
any
fine
imposed
for
the
offense
committed
by
such
prisoner.
under
a
literal
reading
of
that
portion
of
3624(e),
a
defendant
would
not
be
released
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
until
it
agreed
to
this...
until
it
agreed
to
this
fine
schedule,
regardless
of
whether
their
sentence
of
imprisonment
had
already
run.
and
that,
if
we're
going
to
read
3624(e)
literally,
all
the
way
through,
then
under
that
literal
portion
we
have
the
same
problem
that
justice
scalia
talked
about
in
a
person
being
wrongfully
imprisoned
just
because
the
bureau
of
prisons
didn't
like
them
or
whatever.
we
have
the
same
exact
situation,
if
you
read
that
literally.
of
course,
that's
not
what
congress
intended,
and
the
cases
that
i've
cited
indicate
that
if
congress'
intent
is
contrary
to
what
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
says,
then
in
fact
this
court
can
read
it
to
construe
the
statute
to
congress'
intent,
and
i--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--well--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--under
a
literal
reading
of
3624(e)
it
would
appear
to
me
that
he
has
to
hold
them
until
he
agrees
to
sign,
regardless
of
the
prison
term.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct.
well--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--and
that's
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes.
yes,
justice
scalia,
it
is
unjust
because
it's
not
necessarily
one
of
the
terms
of
their
supervised
release
in--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
and
in
effect
what
you
would
have
under
that
circumstance
is,
you
would
have
a
bureau
of
prison
official
making
the
decision
as
to,
incarcerate
the
defendant
for
a
longer
period
of
time
without
any
hearing,
without
any
due
process.
it
would
just
be
that
this
determination
was
made,
therefore
we're
holding
him
for
the
balance
of
the
term.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
mr.
chief
justice,
when
a
defendant
is
accused
of
violating
the
terms
of
his
supervised
release,
once
he
is
out
he
then
has
a
hearing
before
the
united
states
district
judge
and
he
can
defend
himself,
he
has
the
right
to
counsel,
and
only
after
a
finding
that
he
has
in
fact
violated
the
terms
of
his
supervised
release
can
he
then
be
reincarcerated,
and
it's
up
to
the
judge,
the
sentencing
judge
to
not
only
find
the
term
of...
or
find
the
revocation
but
also
find
the
new
term.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
submitting
that
in
fact
no...
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
result
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
intends.
they
didn't
enact
part
of
3624(e)--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes,
your
honor,
you
have...
but
in
order
to
look
at
the
congress'
intent,
you
not
only
have
to
look
at
the
exact...
or
the
language
that
we're
speaking
of,
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
overall
structure
of
the
statute
and
the
related
statutes
that
are
imposed
at
the
same
time.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
well,
because
in
any
other
circumstance
the
defendant
in
violation
of
a
supervised
release
term
is
entitled
to
the
full
due
process
rights.
this
would
be
the
only
circumstance
in
all
of
the
united
states
code
in
which
a
defendant
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
due
process
of
going
before
the
judge
and
having
the
right
to
counsel.
this
would
be
the
only
one,
if
in
fact
that
was
the
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
well--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--i
would
submit
that
any
bureau
of
prisons
official
is,
even
if
they
do
not
sign
is
going
to
release
them
and
then
probably--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes.
i
believe
that
any
bureau
of
prisons
official--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes.
yes.
but--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--well--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
united
states
has
made
is
that
no
part...
that
supervised
release
and
detention
are
antonyms,
and
therefore
they
can
never
be
run
concurrently
with
each
other
in--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct,
and
with
regards...
one
item
that
we
haven't
looked
at
is
the...
how
18
u.s.c.
section
3742
plays
out,
and
how
in
the
case
where
a
defendant
is...
where
we're
not
looking
at
a
retroactive
application
of
bailey,
but
we're
looking
at
a
guideline
sentence
that
was
imposed
erroneously,
if
a
defendant
receives
a
term
of,
let's
say,
3
years
imprisonment
and
a
1-year
term
of
supervised
release,
then
if
he...
if
that
defendant
does
not
get
through
the
appellate
process
by
the
time
the
3
years
imprisonment
have
occurred,
then
the
case
is
mooted
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
is
not
entitled
to
any
relief.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
well,
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
in
that
case
there
is
enough
to
obtain
jurisdiction.
the
only
collateral
consequence
that
some
of
the
cases
that
i've
cited
to
talks
about,
there's
two
consequences
that
they
say
are
a
result
of
that.
one
of
those
is
the
fact
that
supervised
release
can
be
credited
against
for
the
wrong
term
of
imprisonment,
and
then
the
second
part
of
that
is
in
the
situation
where,
if
a
future
crime
is
committed,
that
the
length
of
this
sentence
could
have
impact
on
the
length
of
the
future
sentence.
but
then
you're
getting,
if
the
only
collateral
consequence
is
that
particular
matter,
the
length
of
the
sentence
affecting
the
length
of
a
future
sentence
that
may
occur
somewhere
down
the
road,
then
you're
getting
to
the
point
where
there
might
not
be
a
case
or
controversy
sufficient
enough
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
decide
the
matter.
so
that
collateral
consequence
is
the
only
one
that's
discussed.
if
that's
the
only
collateral
consequence
that
we're
talking
about,
i
would
have
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
could
even
have
the
case,
or
whether
it
would
be
mooted
at
that
point.
in
the
case
where
a
defendant
received
a
term
of
under
a
year,
then
conceivably
that
part
of
it
wouldn't
even
make
a
difference,
because
it
might
not
make
any
difference
on
his
future
sentence,
so
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
a
defendant
who's
obtained
a
wrongful
guidelines
sentence
and
has
no
way
to
vindicate
that
wrongful
sentence
under
3742,
which
congress
clearly
intended
to
be
allowed.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that
was
in
response
to
the
united
states
v.
blake
case,
which
was
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cited,
and
i
would
submit
that
that's
further
evidence
that
the
sentencing
commission
believed
that
you
could
provide
credit
against
supervised
release,
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
change
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
to
take
care
of
that
particular
problem.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that
would
be
the
case
if,
in
fact,
that
particular
guideline
was
made
retroactive,
which
it
was
not
under
1b1.10.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
justice
scalia--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--is
justice
scalia
referring
to
the
3583,
the
credit
after
the
1-year
term
of...
the
early
termination
provision?
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
well,
the
problem
with
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--first
you
have
to
serve
a
year.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
before
you
can
even
ask.
so
you
have
that
problem,
and
in
this
particular
defendant's
case
it
would
make
a
difference,
because
he
only
had
6
months
to
go
at
the
time
that
he
was
released,
if
he
would
have
gotten
the
full
credit,
so
he
would
have
had
to
serve
an
additional
6
months
before
he
could--
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
--and
then
we
still
have
the
problem
with
the
judge's
discretion,
and
even
if
it's
under
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
by
the
time
a
particular
defendant
could
get
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
then
we...
he
would
more
than
likely
serve
a
lot
of
his
term
anyway.
mr.
kevin
m.
schad
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
