unknown
speaker
suppose
that
you
don't
have
the
situation
which
existed
here,
where
he
was
wrongfully
convicted
and
serving
a
term
on
a
wrongful
conviction,
but
suppose
that
just
in
violation
of
his
rights
the
prison
keeps
him
in
for
3
years
after
the...
his
term
of
proper
conviction
had
actually
expired.
do
you
think
we'd
be
obliged
to
have
him
serve
his
term
of
3
years'
supervised
release
after
those
3
years
of
wrongful
imprisonment
had
already
occurred?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--which
would
be
discretionary,
with
approval?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
this
ought
to
be
discretionary.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
we
interpret
the
words,
does
not
run
during
any
period
in
which
the
person
is
imprisoned
in
connection
with
a
conviction,
why
can't
we
interpret
that
to
mean
reasonably,
properly
imprisoned
in
connection
with
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
what
is...
is
there
a
statute
that
governs
the
service
of
consecutive
sentences?
unknown
speaker
and
all
sentences
shall
be
aggregated,
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
statute
didn't
read
that,
and
suppose
that
a
person
is
serving
consecutive
sentences
under
a
provision
either
in
the
statute
or
in
the
judicial
sentence
which
says
his
time
for
the
second
conviction
shall
not
begin
to
run
until
the
service
of
his
time
for
the
first
conviction
has
expired,
all
right,
and
then
it
turns
out
that
the
first
conviction
was
improper.
he
served
5
years
in
prison
wrongfully.
you'd
still
put
him
in
for
the
next
5?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
supervised
release.
i'm
talking
about
a
second
conviction.
he's
serving
consecutive
terms.
unknown
speaker
the
first
term
is
invalidated.
they're
both
5
years--
unknown
speaker
--5-year
terms.
the
first
term
is
wrong.
he
shouldn't
have
been
there
on
that
first
term.
he
served
5
years.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
say,
well,
sorry
for
that
mistake,
but
here's
the
second
term
of
5
years.
we
want
you
to
serve
that
now.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
the
same
sovereign
there
might
be
a
due
process
problem?
unknown
speaker
why
might
there
not
be
a
due
process
problem
where
the
second
sentence
is
a
sentence
to
supervised
release?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not...
i
mean,
it
may
serve
different
purposes,
but
you're
not
entitled
to
force
someone
to
undergo
it
except
as
punishment
for
a
crime,
right?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
there
may
be
a
due
process
problem
in
forcing
him
to
serve
the
second
conviction.
why
wouldn't
there
be
a
due
process
problem
in
forcing
him
to
serve
the
supervised
release
that
is
a
punishment
for
the
second
conviction?
it
may
serve
rehabilitative
purposes
as
well,
but
it's
a
punishment.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
is
a
due
process
problem,
why
shouldn't
we
strain
to
interpret
this
statute
in
order
to
avoid
the
due
process
problem?
unknown
speaker
at
the
discretion
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
that's
very
nice.
if
a
conviction
were
set
aside,
it
wouldn't
just
be
the
prison
term
that
was
set
aside.
it
would
be
the
supervised
release,
too,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
here,
the
supervised
release
was
ordered
in
connection
with
the
drug
offenses
which--
unknown
speaker
--were
not
the
offenses,
the
gun-related
offense
that
was
wrongfully
imposed?
unknown
speaker
and
what
has
happened
to
this...
to
mr.
johnson
since
the
sixth
circuit
decision?
has
he
been
on
supervised
release
or
not?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
and
off--
unknown
speaker
--supervision,
and
the
consequences
of
a
reversal
here
would
be
that
he
would
go
back
on
for
a
period
of--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
oppose
that
motion?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this
is
christmas
time,
almost.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
of
the
argument
that
you
have
to
give
credit
for
even
periods
of
liberty
erroneously
granted,
that
that
counts
against
the
sentence
if
they
let
you
out
by
mistake,
and
then
you
get
it
all
back,
the
time
that
you
were
out
counts
as
part
of
your
sentence,
and
the
anomaly
that
you
don't
get
credit
for
time
wrongfully
served
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
you
could
argue
that
that
rule
is
thoroughly
in
accord
with
the
rule
that
you're
arguing
for.
that
gives
the
government,
that
deprives
the
government
of
incarceration
time
to
which
it
is
entitled,
just
as
the
position
you're
arguing
for
deprives
the
defendant
of
freedom
time
to
which
he's
entitled,
so
maybe
there's
a
certain
equity
in
that,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
justice
scalia's
comment
that
this
statute
has
a
punitive...
that
supervisory
release
is
a
form
of
punishment?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
entirely
punitive.
unknown
speaker
at
least
there
is
an
element
of
punishment
here.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that
element,
simply
the
fact
that
he
is
required
to
report
periodically,
or
what-not?
unknown
speaker
he's
deprived
of
certain
liberties
that
ordinary
citizens
don't
have,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
cannot
carry
firearms.
unknown
speaker
what's
the...
what
is
the
rehabilitative
aspect
of
it?
i
mean,
part
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
this
is
for
his
benefit
to
ease
his
transition
back
into
society.
is
there
anything
beyond
what
you
have
just
described
that
helps
him
ease
his
way?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
lot
like
parole,
then?
unknown
speaker
if
this
defendant
were
to
violate
his
terms
of
supervised
release,
what
would
be
the
maximum
liability
that
he
would
have
for
that
violation?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
schad,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
date
may
1996?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
you.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
does
the
united
states
say
that
he
is
not
on
supervised
release
now?
how
do
we
know
that
he's
not
on
supervised
release?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
that
suspension
to
be
tolled,
that
requires
the
supervised
release
time
to
be
tolled
by
reason
of
that
suspension?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
until...
you
said
it
ran
out
in
may
1999?
unknown
speaker
so
that
under...
why
do
you...
i
mean,
what
are
we
arguing
about?
isn't...
under
3583
the
unusual
defendant
who
finds
himself
in
your
client's
situation
has
a
remedy.
he
goes
back
to
the
district
court
and
he
says,
judge,
i
would
like
you
to
end
the
supervised
release
so
it's
only
a
year
long,
and
during
that
year
i
would
like
there
to
be
no
conditions
at
all.
so...
and
the
judge
has
adequate
power
to
do
that,
doesn't
he,
so
what's
the
problem?
and
all
judges
are
thoroughly
reasonable
and
will
come
to
the
right
decision--
[laughter]
--tendered
towards
the
defendant,
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
possible
not
all
judges
are
thoroughly
reasonable,
i
agree
with
that.
what--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
he
has
a
special...
that
kind
of
special
burden,
and
then
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
a
person
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
a,
and
he
has
two
punishments,
x
months
in
prison
and
a
$50,000
fine.
now,
suppose
he's
also
convicted
of
crime
b,
and
he
serves
prison
in
crime
b,
and
unfortunately
that
conviction
was
erroneous,
so
it's
reversed
after
he
receives
some
time.
that's
our
basic
situation.
not
a,
but
b
was
reversed.
all
right.
does
the
government
now
have
to
give
his
money
back
for
the
fine
on
crime
a?
unknown
speaker
no,
they're
not
related
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so
if
he's
fined
solely
on
crime
a,
which
has
nothing
to
do
b,
and
it
turns
out
that
b
was
erroneous,
not
a,
he
has
to
give
back
the
money
on
crime
a?
unknown
speaker
the
government
has
to
give
it
back?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
think
it
would
be--
[laughter]
all
right.
that
being
so,
how
does
supervised
release
for
crime
a
differ
from
the
fine?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
say,
take
the
present
case,
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--you
know,
i...
you
see,
my
question
is--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
doesn't
affect
part
2
of
the
punishment
for
the
first
crime,
namely
crime
a,
you
know,
why
does
it
affect
part
2,
where
the
only
difference
is
instead
of
a
fine
for
crime
a
it's
supervised
release
for
crime
a?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schad,
if
he's
fined
incorrectly
for
crime
b,
can
he
get
the
money
back?
unknown
speaker
if
he's
incarcerated
incorrectly
for
crime
b,
can
he
get
the
time
back?
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
fair
to
give
him
the
time
back
by
not
putting
him
in
for
the
additional
5
years
on
crime
a.
that's
a
somewhat
different
situation,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
only
way
to
give
him
the
5
years
out
of
his
life
back
is
not
to
have
the
incarcerated
release
tolled
against
him.
unknown
speaker
but
what
of
the
government's
argument
that
supervised
release,
although
it
may
have
a
punitive
aspect,
is
primarily
designed
to
have
the
person
monitored
during
his
transition
back
into
the
community
and,
indeed,
i
think
the
government
says
the
serious
business
of
the
crime
is
not
a
factor
in
the
term
of
supervised
release,
but
rather
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
certainly
a
difference
in
degree
at
least,
isn't
there,
from
the
rehabilitative
aspects
of
supervised
release
as
opposed
to
a
prison?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schad,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
position
is
this.
if
i
thought
we
were
writing
on
a
totally
clean
or
unwritten
slate
here,
i
would
say
yes,
we
ought
to
try
to
tinker
with
the
mechanism
of
supervised
release
in
order
to
give
at
least
as
much
credit
as
can
be
given
for
what
the
government
wrongfully
exacted
from
him.
but
the
slate
isn't
clean,
and
when
i
look
at
the
supervised
release
scheme
in
the
statute
i
see
that
congress
in
effect
has
said,
there
are
two
ways
you
can
tinker
with
it.
you
can
reduce
the
supervised
release
term
down
to
a
year,
and
you
can,
in
fact,
remove
or
eliminate
some
of
the
customary
conditions
of
supervised
release
during
the
period
in
which
it
runs.
and
that
seems
to
suggest
to
me
that
congress
is
saying,
this
is
the
only
kind
of
tinkering
you
can
do.
if
you
find
equitable
grounds
to
do
these
things,
you
can
do
them,
but
equitable
grounds
do
not
give
you
a
basis
for
doing
anything
more
than
this,
so
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
congress
has
in
effect
circumscribed
and
intended
to
circumscribe
the
court's
discretion
here.
is
there
an
answer
to
that
problem
that
i
have?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
true
that
we
do
have
a
valid
conviction
and
a
valid
term
of
supervised
release?
he's
already
served
the
time
on
the
valid
conviction,
but
we
do
have
a
valid
conviction.
unknown
speaker
but
the
supervised
release
term
is
not
dependant
entirely
on
the
924(c)
count,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he's
released
improperly.
there's
an
administrative
snafu
in
the
prison,
and
he's
released
prematurely
from
the
sentence
that
he's
validly
serving.
does
the
supervised
release
time
begin
to
run?
while
he's
out,
do
they
credit
him
for
supervised
release
time?
unknown
speaker
they
do?
unknown
speaker
that
he
be
reincarcerated?
unknown
speaker
so
if
he's
walking
around
free
for
a
year
because
there's
been
an
administrative
mistake,
and
then
they
yank
him
back
in
to
serve
the
rest
of
his
sentence,
he
would
have
had
a
year
knocked
off
of
his
later
supervised
release
time?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
what
do
you
think
the
situation
is,
if
he
says,
heck,
no,
i
won't
sign?
what
is
the
prison
official
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
turn
him
loose
anyway?
unknown
speaker
hold
him
until
the
supervised
release
period
is
over?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
he
refuses
to
sign,
you
convert
his
supervised
release
into
an
additional
term
of
imprisonment.
unknown
speaker
which
seems
to
me
fair
enough.
why
is
that
an
absurd
result?
i
mean,
the
deal
is,
we'll
give
you
supervised
release
if
you
agree
to
this.
if
you
don't
want
to
agree
to
it,
fine,
we
won't
give
you
supervised
release.
we'll
keep
you
right
here.
that
seems
to
you
very
unjust?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
it
says
that.
it
says
that.
unknown
speaker
no
prisoners
shall
be
released...
it
seems
to
me
what
they're
telling
the
prison
official
is,
if
he
doesn't
agree
to
pay,
to
pay
the
fine
he
owes,
convert
his
supervised
release
time
into
additional
imprisonment
time.
unknown
speaker
perfectly
consistent
with
the
process
set
out
in
the
sentence.
he
has
not
complied
with
something
that
the
congress
has
said
he
has
to
comply
with
for
supervised
release.
i
don't
see
any
due
process
question
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
very
likely,
if
he
felt
that
he
had
agreed
to
the
installment
schedule
and
the
prison
official
was
just
being
arbitrary
and
not
releasing
him,
he
would
have
an
action
for
habeas
corpus,
the
district
court
to
tell
him
that
he's
no
longer
being
properly
incarcerated,
but
that
doesn't
go
to
whether
congress
can
exact
that
sort
of
a
condition.
you're
saying
if
the
prison
official
improperly
passes
on
the
facts
he
should
have
a
chance
to
challenge.
of
course
he
does,
but
if
the
prison
officer
is
right
on
the
facts,
the
guy
should
stay.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
best
talisman,
or
index
for
deciding
what
the
intent
of
congress
was?
what
better
than
the
words
they
chose?
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
inconsistent
with
the
other
provisions,
the
provision...
the
last
sentence,
that
you
say
they
couldn't
possibly
have
meant
literally?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
the
alternative
that
you
think
congress
had
in
mind
is.
unknown
speaker
if
congress
didn't
want
them
to
keep
the
guy
until
he
signs
the
agreement,
which
they
say
he
must
sign,
what
was...
what
is...
what
are
you
supposed
to
do,
torture
him
until
he
coughs
up
the
agreement?
what--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
your
alternative?
how
do
you
think
that
sentence
ought
to
be
played
out?
unknown
speaker
the
guy
says,
heck
no,
i
won't
sign.
unknown
speaker
in
violation
of
the
law,
which
says
no
prisoner
shall
be
released
unless
he
agrees
to
adhere
to,
and
he
hasn't
agreed
to.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your...
that
in
your
mind
gives
a
more
reasonable
interpretation
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
are
you
helped
by
the
second-to-last
sentence,
in
your
view,
which
does
conceive
of
the
proposition
that
there
can
be
concurrent
running--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
would
say
this
is
not
in
connection
with
a
conviction,
so
that
sentence
is
inapplicable?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
statute
itself
acknowledges
that
possibility
in
the
30-day
context
when
it
is
in
connection
with
a
conviction,
and
you
would
have
to
say
this
is
not
in
connection
with
a
conviction.
unknown
speaker
the
excess
time.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
so?
aren't
there
collateral
consequences
to
a
criminal
conviction
that
would
still
entitle
the
defendant
to
appeal?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
guidelines
are
concerned,
wasn't
there
a
change
made
in
response
to
whatever
was
the
court
of
appeals
decision
to
say
that
you
can't
go
back
any
further
than
time
served?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
if
they
have
one...
had
precedent
going
the
other
way
they'd
want
to
remove
any
doubt
on
this
subject.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schad,
would
the
apparent
unfairness
of
this
thing...
at
least
i
consider
it
apparently
unfair...
be
remedied
if
we
held
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
a
judge
not
to
exercise
his
option
to
remit
the
supervised
release
time?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
is
within
his
discretion,
but
couldn't
we
say
it
would
be
an
abuse
in
these
circumstances
not
to--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
you
still
get
1
year.
unknown
speaker
you
still
get
1
year.
unknown
speaker
before
he
could
even
ask,
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
government...
if
the
judge
wrongfully
allows
him,
the
government
would
have
a
long
time
to
get
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
that
works
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
schad.
ms.
mcdowell,
you
have
17
minutes
remaining.
the
only
question
i
have,
ms.
mcdowell,
is
how
do
you
interpret
in
connection
with
the
conviction
in
the
second-to-last
sentence?
do
you
say
that
this
sentence
that
was
being
served
here
was
in
connection
with
the
conviction,
the
excess
portion?
unknown
speaker
ms.
mcdowell,
how
do
you...
how
would
the
government
construe
this
situation,
which
came
up
in
one
of
the
hypotheticals:
an
individual
is
prematurely
released.
it's
a
mistake.
during
the
period
of
release,
the
individual
is
on
supervised
release.
then
the
mistake
is
recognized,
the
prisoner
is
hauled
back
and
reincarcerated
to
serve
some
remainder
of
time.
under
those...
and
ultimately,
of
course,
he's
released
again.
when
the
prisoner
is
released,
this
time
properly,
is
there
a
credit
against
the
supervised
release
time
for
the
period
of
supervised
release
between
the
two
incarcerations?
unknown
speaker
yes.
he
signed
the
form
and
they
supervised
his
job
and
so
on.
they
did...
everything
was
done,
so
he
was
actually
being
supervised
during
the
period
of
the
release.
would
he
get
credit
for
it
when
he
was
released
the
second
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
serves
the--
unknown
speaker
--that
serves
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
which
is
your
argument,
but
it
does
sort
of
undercut
the
theory
that
we
need
to
be
literal
about
the
terms
of
the
statute,
because
the
prisoner
in
effect
is
in
need
of
this
supervision
for
whatever
period
of
time
is
prescribed,
and
so
it
would
seem
that
the
literal
interpretation
and
the
rationale
for
being
literal
seem
to
be
at
odds
with
each
other
in
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
and
hence
would--
unknown
speaker
--would
likewise,
then,
have
discretion
i
presume,
on
your
theory,
not
to
give
any
credit
at
all.
unknown
speaker
basically
i
guess
your
argument
is,
no
system
is
perfect,
but
we're
going
to
get
closer
to
what
congress
intended
if
we
just
be
literal
about
this.
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
your
answer
really
doesn't
make
everything
work
out
okay.
if
he
is
subject
to
parole
on
another
conviction,
maybe
even
from
another
sovereign
on
a
state
conviction,
the
statute
provides
that
his
federal
supervised
release
shall
run
concurrently
with
that
other
parole
or
supervised
release,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
suppose
he
has
2
years
parole
on
a
state
conviction
he
has
to
serve
after
he's
done
his
federal
sentence,
okay.
he
also
has
a
2-year
federal
supervised
release
sentence.
they
let
him
out
early.
he
serves
his
2
years
federal
supervised
release,
which
he
would
normally
have
been
serving
concurrently
with
his
state
parole
for
2
years,
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
find
out
the
mistake,
you
bring
him
back
in,
he's
going
to
have
to
serve
another
2
years
of
supervised
release,
isn't
he,
or
parole?
he'll
have
to
serve
his
state
parole
even
though...
see
what
i
mean?
unknown
speaker
he
will
have
lost
2
years
of
freedom,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
up
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
kind
of
one...
just
ask
you
to
comment
on
one
thing?
one
of
the
things
that's
troubling
all
of
us,
i
think,
is
the
extent
to
which
the
supervised
release
is
really
the
functional
equivalent
of
what...
the
time
he's
already
served,
or
its...
in
its
punitive
aspects,
and
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
provides
what
goes
into
the
supervised
release
is
the
kind
of
a
catch-all
provision
that
the
judge
can
impose
any
other
condition
it
considers
to
be
appropriate.
is
there...
is
that
as
unlimited,
in
your
view,
as
it
sounds?
i
mean,
could
the
judge
require
him
to
report
every
3
days
instead
of
every
30
days,
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
do
the
standard
conditions
include
a
consent
to
warrantless
searches
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
unannounced
visits
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
instead
of
torturing
them.
i'm
glad
to
hear
that.
[laughter]
i
thought
they'd
probably
do
that.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
