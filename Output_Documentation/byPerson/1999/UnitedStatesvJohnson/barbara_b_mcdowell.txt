ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
when
a
federal
criminal
defendant's
term
of
supervised
release
begins.
the
unambiguous
text
of
18
u.s.c.
3624(e)
provides
the
answer.
that
section
states
that
a
defendant's
term
of
supervised
release
commences
on
the
day
he
is
released
from
imprisonment.
it
further
states
that
a
term
of
supervised
release
does
not
run
during
any
period
in
which
the
defendant
is
imprisoned,
except
for
a
period
of
less
than
30
days.
that's
until
a
defendant
is
actually
released
from
prison,
his
supervised
release
does
not
begin.
the
statute
provides--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
your
honor.
he
would
have
no
remedy
that's
based
on
his
supervised
release
term
that
would
be
automatic.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
he
could,
however,
move
under
section
3583
for
reduction
in
his
term
of
supervised
release.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
would
be
discretionary,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
would--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
that
would
still
be
inconsistent
with
the
earlier
sentence
in
that
same
provision
that
says
the
term
of
supervised
release
commences
on
the
day
the
person
is
released
from
imprisonment.
that
seems
to
contemplate
actual
release,
not
could
have
been,
should
have
been,
or
would
have
been
released.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
there
is.
there's
a
statute
that
provides
that
for
administrative
purposes
all
sentences
will
be
aggregated.
that's
section
3584,
i
believe.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
has
the
effect
of,
if
one
sentence
happens
to
be
vacated
defendant
will
automatically
receive
credit
against
a
subsequent
consecutive
sentence.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
still
require
him
to
serve
a
term
of
supervised
release
if
there
was
still
a
term
of--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
courts--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--uh-huh.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
uh-huh.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
could
conceivably
be
a
due
process
problem
with
that.
the
courts
haven't
addressed
that
particular
issue,
perhaps
because
the
united
states
government
has
this
aggregation
provision
and
states
have
similar
provisions
as
a
result
of
statute,
or
court
decision.
the
due
process
question
has
come
up
typically
in
the
context
of
whether
a
vacated
state
sentence
has
to
be
credited
against
a
federal
sentence
still
to
be
served,
or
vice
versa,
and
the
courts
have
held
there's
no
due
process
problem
in
those
circumstances
because
of
the
dual
sovereignty.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
this
could
conceivably
be
a
different
situation.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
could
conceivably
be.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
because
supervised
release
serves
different
purposes
than
a
term
of
imprisonment.
it's
supposed
to
assist
the
defendant's
transition
into
society
and
to
protect
the
community.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
true,
but
in
this
case,
in
the
case
i
conceive
we're
talking
about,
the
defendant
still
has
a
valid
term
of
supervised
release
attached
to
a
valid
conviction.
we
wouldn't,
of
course,
insist
that
a
defendant--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--serve
a
term
of
supervised
release
otherwise.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
may
be--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
the
only
conceivable
due
process
problem
would
be
in
the
context
of
two
terms
of
imprisonment.
we
conceive
that
since
the
purposes
of
supervised
release
are
so
different,
and
because
they
are
so
much
less
intrusive
on
a
defendant,
and
because
a
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
get
out
of
the
term
of
supervised
release
after
1
year,
based
on
his
behavior
and
the
interest
of
justice,
that
it's
not
the
same
situation.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
at
the
discretion
of
the
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
there
are
still
valid
convictions
to
which
the
term
of
supervised
release
was
attached.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
were
in
fact
two
drug
offenses,
each
of
which
carried
a
mandatory
term
of
supervised
release
of
at
least
3
years.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
he
had
been
on
supervised
release
under
the
district
court's
decision--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--and
served
somewhat
in
excess
of
2
years
on
supervised
release.
he
was
then
released
immediately--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--upon
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
he
would
still
have
approximately
9
months
more
to
spend
on
supervised
release.
he
would,
of
course,
have
the
opportunity
to
move
under
section
3583(e)
for
a
reduction
or
termination
of
that
term.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
knowing
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
defendant--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
difficult
to
say.
the
government
has
in
a
number
of
cases
involving
similar
bailey
defendants
not
opposed
a
motion
for
early
termination.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
another
section
of
the
same
statute,
section
3624(a),
to
hold
that
this
statute
is
ambiguous.
we
disagree.
section
3624(a)
says
nothing
about
supervised
release.
much
less
does
it
suggest
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
remedy
of
a
credit
against
his
term
of
supervised
release
if
he
ends
up
spending
more
time
in
prison
than
in
retrospect
he
should
have
spent.
indeed,
section
3624(a),
which
states
simply
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
should
release...
shall
release
a
prisoner
at
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
imprisonment,
is
not
even
violated
in
this
circumstance,
where
the
bureau
of
prisons
releases
the
defendant
on
the
very
day
specified
under
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
district
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it's
questionable,
your
honor,
whether
the
doctrine
that
you're
referring
to,
the
common
law
doctrine,
has
any
continuing
validity.
as
judge
posner
noted
in
a
1994
opinion,
it
hasn't
been
applied
to
a
defendant's
benefit
in
many
years.
we
would
suggest
that
the
clear
language
of
section
3624(e)
supersedes
the
common
law
in
this
regard.
also,
this
doctrine--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
the
doctrine
has
been
applied
only
in
circumstances
where
the
government
is
negligent
or
at
greater
fault.
certainly
in
these
circumstances,
where
a
defendant
has
been
held
under
a
valid
conviction
that
was
correct
under
sixth
circuit
law
until
bailey,
it's
difficult
to
find
any
fault
on
the
part
of
the
government
similar
to
those
in
the
constructive
parole
cases.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
may
be
punitive
aspects
to
it,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it's
principle
purpose,
as
conceived
by
congress,
was
not
punitive.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
may
well
be,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
your
honor,
that's
part
of
it.
that's
not
all
that
supervised
release
entails,
however.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
he's
required,
for
example,
to
maintain
a
job,
to
go
to
substance
abuse
counseling--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--not
to
leave
the
district
without
seeking
permission
from
his
probation
officer
or
the
court--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
for
example,
one
of
the
standard
conditions
of
supervised
release,
and
one
of
those
imposed
in
this
case,
is
the
defendant
work
regularly
at
gainful
employment.
the
probation
officer,
working
with
the
defendant,
will
put
him
in
touch
with
potential
employers,
or
with
job
placement
agencies,
and
will
monitor
his
performance
on
the
job.
this
provides
a
certain
amount
of
assistance
and
discipline
to
assist
in
his
rehabilitation.
similarly,
a
condition--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
quite
similar,
in
this
aspect,
to
parole.
parole
was
different
in
that
it
was
not
a
separate
term
of
a
defendant's
sentence.
it
was
simply
served
at
the
end
of
a
term
of
imprisonment.
that's
why
this
issue
didn't
come
up
during
the
parole
era.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
conceivably,
at
least
4
years.
the
period
of...
to
which
a
defendant
can
be
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
a
violation
of
supervised
release
is
set
forth
in
the
statute.
it's
been
held
by
several
courts
of
appeals
that
terms
of
imprisonment
upon
revocation
of
supervised
release
can
run
consecutively,
even
if
the
terms
of
supervised
release
themselves
run
concurrently.
so
in
this
case,
since
there
was
supervised
release
imposed
on
the
two
drug
counts,
conceivably
mr.
johnson
could
be
subject
to
4
years.
the
bureau
of
prisons
has,
in
fact,
construed
the
crediting
statute,
3585,
to
give
a
defendant
whose
supervised
release
has
been
revoked
credit
against
his
subsequent
sentence
for
any
time
that
he
erroneously
spent
in
prison
previously.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
it
was.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
don't
believe
that
the
situation
has
ever
come
up.
if
the
defendant
was
actually
serving
supervised
release
under
the
supervision
of
the
probation
office--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--he
might
well,
your
honor,
because
under
the
wording
of
the
statute
his
term
of
supervised
release
would
have
commenced
upon
his
first
release
from
prison.
it
then
would
have
been
tolled
when
he
went
back
to
prison
for
the
period
that
he
was
spending
there,
and
then
would
start
up
again
once
he
was
released--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--so
i
think
it's
possible
it
would
be
construed
that
way
to
give
him
credit.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
district
court
would
still
have
the
opportunity,
if
it
appeared
necessary
to
extend
the
defendant's
term
of
supervised
release,
if
it
appeared
necessary
to
serve
the
deterrence
and
rehabilitation
purposes
beyond
the
term
that
was
initially
imposed,
unless
it
was
already--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--to
a
maximum.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
effectively
not
to
do
that
by
lengthening
a
term
of
supervised
release.
however,
if
it
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
maximum
time
of
supervised
release
that
the
defendant
could
serve,
if
he
had
served,
say,
1
year
before
he
went
back
into
prison
there
might
be
a
limit
beyond
which
the
district
court
couldn't
go
in
extending
the
period--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
right.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
oh,
whether
he
would
still
have
to
spend
the
term
of
state
parole
or
not
would
be
a
matter--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--of
state
law
for...
the
state
judge
might
decide
that
he
would
not
have
to
serve
in
those
circumstances--
on
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
your
honor,
if
the
judge
felt
that
that
was
necessary
to
serve
the
purposes
of
supervised
release.
in
addition
to
the
statute,
the
sentencing
guidelines
set
forth
the
standard
conditions
of
supervised
release
that
should
be
imposed
in
most
cases,
and
that
provides
a
little
more
clarity
to
what's
in
the
statute.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
essentially
it's
a
consent
that
the
probation
officer
may
visit
the
defendant's
home
and
seize
whatever
he
happens
to
find
there.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
on
the
point
that
a
term
of
imprisonment
may
serve
some
of
those
same
rehabilitative
purposes
as
supervised
release,
that
may
be
true,
but
supervised
release
is,
indeed,
different,
because
the
defendant
is
living
in
the
community.
it's
only
then
that
he
can
be
expected
to
maintain
a
regular
job,
to
receive
the
outpatient
drug
counseling
that
he
may
need,
to
meet
his
child
support
and
other
family
obligations.
it's
one
thing,
for
example,
for
a
defendant
to
remain
drug
or
alcohol-free
when
he's
in
prison,
where
drugs
are
not
available
at
all,
or
available
only
in
rare
circumstances,
and
where
he
is
under
constant
and
pervasive
supervision.
it's
quite
another
matter
for
the
defendant
to
avoid
use
of
drugs
and
alcohol
when
he's
back
in
the
community,
subject
to
the
same
pressures
and
influences
and
temptations
that
got
him
into
trouble
in
the
first
place.
that's
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
supervised
release
is
different,
and
why
it
is
necessary
as
a
rehabilitative
measure.
on
the
point
that
mr.
schad
raised
about
the
possible
mooting
of
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
defendant's
term
of
supervised
release
had
terminated
upon
the
issuance
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
at
that
point,
he
still
had
approximately
9
months
to
serve
on
supervised
release.
given
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
it
would
be
incorrect
to
assume
that
the
defendant
was
still
continuing
in
some
manner
to
serve
his
term
of
supervised
release,
albeit
without
any
sort
of
supervision
by
the
probation
office.
in
terms
of
holding
defendant
if
he
fails
to
agree
to
the
payment,
to
a
fine
schedule,
it's
our
understanding
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
indeed
will
hold
defendants
in
those
circumstances
for
the
period
of
supervised
release
if
they
don't
agree
to
a
fine
schedule.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
in
terms
of
mr.
schad's
point
on
the
necessity
for
a
crediting
rule
in
order
to
preserve
appeals,
congress,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
as
dealt
with
that
problem
much
more
directly
in
18
u.s.c.
3143,
which
provides
for
a
defendant
to
be...
remain
on
release
status
pending
his
appeal
if
it
appears
that
otherwise
his
sentence
could
expire
before
his
appeal
is
decided.
that,
of
course,
is
available
only
in
particular
circumstances
where
the
defendant
is
not
a
threat
or
a
risk
of
flight,
and
where
he
has
some
likelihood
of
prevailing
on
his
appeal.
finally,
justice
scalia
had
inquired
whether
an
abuse
of...
it
might
be
held
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
a
district
court
refuses
to
release
a
defendant
in
these
circumstances
after
1
year.
the
statutory
language
doesn't
seem
to
allow
that
sort
of
rule,
because
it
requires
the
district
court
to
consider
not
only
the
interests
of
justice
but
also
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
and
if
the
defendant's
conduct
does
not
warrant
the
elimination
of
all
supervised
release
at
that
time,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
release
him.
the
statute
requires
that
the
district
court
take
into
account
a
number
of
factors
in
deciding
a
motion
under
3583(e)(1).
that
includes
not
only
the
interests
of
justice,
but
also
the
protection
of
the
community
and
the
defendant's
continuing
rehabilitation
needs.
thank
you.
