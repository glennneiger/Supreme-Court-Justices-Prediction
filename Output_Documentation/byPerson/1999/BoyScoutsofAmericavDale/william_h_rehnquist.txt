we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-699,
boy
scouts
of
america
and
monmouth
council
v.
james
dale.
mr.
davidson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it
from
what
you're
saying,
mr.
davidson,
that
perhaps
the
scouts
have
not
adopted
a
comprehensive
policy
covering
every
single
conceivable
situation
that
might
come
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wolfson,
if
we
compare
the
antidiscrimination
laws
such
as
new
jersey
has
enacted
with
the
sort
of
fourteenth
amendment
principles
of
equal
protection,
the...
you
know,
we
start
out
with
people,
with
kind
of
immutable
characteristics,
blacks,
national
origin,
and
then
presumably
homosexuals
are
not
quite
the
same.
supposing
we
would
get
even
further.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
supposing
new
jersey
were
to
pass
a
law
like
that.
at
some
point
the
compelling
state
interest
is
considerably
dissipated,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
the
state's
interest
be
weaker
if
we're
talking
about,
say,
ex-convicts
being
discriminated
against
than
it
would
about
blacks
being
discriminated
against?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
really
answer
my
question
at
all.
i
asked
you
if
the
state
interest
would
be
weaker
if
we
were
talking
about
ex-convicts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying,
mr.
wolfson,
that
it
has
to
be
a
definite
expressive
purpose?
i
mean,
supposing
you
have
some
of
the
kinds
of
organizations
that
justice
breyer
hypothesized:
we're
a
catholic
organization
and
we
just
feel
much
more
comfortable
with
catholics,
and
we
do
catholic
work,
or
a
jewish
organization.
now,
they
don't
have
any
great
message
of...
substantive
message.
can
they
be
required
under
a...
if
a
public
accommodations
law
such
as
new
jersey's
is
construed
as
broadly
as
new
jersey's
is,
to
take
on
non-catholics,
or
non-jews?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
let's
get
away
for
a
moment,
because
my
question
was
intended
to
direct
you
away
from
freedom
of
speech
to
freedom
of
association.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
also
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
i
don't...
what's
your
authority
for
saying
that
freedom
of
association
is
simply
an
instrumental
right
to
further
expression
of
the
members?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
davidson,
we'll
give
you
a
minute.
you
don't
actually
have
quite
that
much.
we'll
be
generous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
99-699.
the
boy
scouts
of
america
versus
dale.
the
boy
scouts
of
america
and
its
monmouth
county
new
jersey
council
are
the
petitioners
here.
i
will
refer
to
them
collectively
as
the
boy
scouts.
the
boy
scouts
is
a
private
not-for-profit
organization
engaged
in
instilling
its
system
of
values
in
young
boys.
james
dale
is
the
respondent.
dale
entered
scouting
at
age
eight
and
remained
as
scout
until
age
18.
by
all
accounts,
he
was
an
exemplary
youth
member
and
attained
the
rank
of
eagle
scout.
in
1989,
he
applied
for
adult
membership
in
the
boy
scouts
and
was
accepted
as
an
assistant
scoutmaster.
shortly
thereafter
he
left
home
to
attend
college
at
rutgers
university.
while
at
rutgers
he
first
acknowledged
to
himself
and
others
that
he
is
gay.
he
quickly
became
involved
with,
and
eventually
became
the
co-president
of,
the
rutgers
university
lesbian
gay
alliance.
in
1990,
he
attended
a
seminar
addressing
the
needs
of
gay
teenagers.
a
newspaper
covering
the
event
published
an
interview
with
dale,
that
addressed
his
advocacy
of
role
models
for
gay
teenagers.
the
article
included
a
picture
of
dale
that
identified
him
as
the
co-president
of
the
lesbian
gay
alliance.
the
boy
scouts
saw
the
article
and
revoked
dale’s
adult
membership.
he
filed
a
complaint
in
the
new
jersey
superior
court
alleging
the
boy
scouts
had
violated
new
jersey's
public
accommodations
law,
which
prohibits
sexual
orientation
based
exclusion
from
places
of
public
accommodation.
that
court's
chancery
division
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
boy
scouts
holding
that
the
boy
scouts
was
not
a
place
of
public
accommodation
for
the
purposes
of
the
new
jersey
law.
the
new
jersey
appellate
division
reversed
holding
that
the
public
accommodations
law
did
apply
to
the
boy
scouts
and
the
law
required
the
boy
scouts
to
readmit
dale.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
division.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
rejected
the
boy
scouts’
claim
enforcing
it
to
admit
dale
would
violated
its
first
amendment
right
of
expressive
association.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
hold
that
the
application
of
new
jersey’s
public
accommodations’
law
in
this
case
violates
the
boys
scouts
first
amendment
rights.
in
roberts
v.
jaycees
we
observed
that
implicit
in
the
right
to
engage
in
activities
protected
by
the
first
amendment
is
a
corresponding
right
to
associate
with
others
in
pursuit
of
a
wide
variety
of
political,
social,
economic,
educational,
religious,
and
cultural
ends.
we
deem
this
right
to
be
the
right
of
expressive
association.
the
expressive
associational
right
is
crucial
in
preventing
the
majority
from
imposing
its
views
on
groups
that
would
rather
express
other,
perhaps
unpopular,
ideas.
in
roberts
we
stated
that
one
of
the
ways
the
government
may
burden
this
freedom
is
by
forcing
the
group
to
accept
a
member
it
does
not
desire.
in
order
to
decide
whether
enforcing
the
boy
scouts
to
accept
dale
violates
the
group’s
first
amendment
rights
to
expressive
association
we
must
make
several
inquiries.
first,
we
must
determine
whether
the
boy
scouts
engage
in
expressive
association
sufficient
to
give
them
first
amendment
protection.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
mission
of
the
boy
scouts
is
to
instill
a
system
of
values
in
young
boys.
it
seems
indisputable
that
this
is
expressive
activity
entitling
the
boy
scouts
to
first
amendment
protection.
next
we
must
determine
whether
the
boy
scouts
express
a
view
about
homosexuality.
the
boy
scouts
asserts
that
homosexual
conduct
is
inconsistent
with
the
values
it
seeks
to
instill
and
that
it
and
"teaches
that
homosexual
conduct
is
not
morally
straight
and
does
not
want
to
promote
homosexual
conduct
as
a
legitimate
form
of
behavior".
we
must
accept
the
boy
scouts’
assertions
as
to
these
matters
because
they
are
undoubtedly
sincerely
held.
in
1978
a
position
statement
under
the
boy
scouts’
executive
committee,
signed
by
the
president
of
the
boy
scouts,
and
the
chief
scout
executive
made
a
statement
to
that
effect.
it
was
revised
many
times
through
the
year
but
its
core
message
remained
consistent.
the
1991
position
statement
stated
that
homosexual
conduct
was
inconsistent
with
scouting
values.
the
same
is
true
of
a
1993
position
statement.
even
more
supportive
of
the
sincerity
of
the
boy
scouts
view
is
the
fact
that
the
organization
has
bee
litigating
this
position
for
almost
20
years
beginning
in
a
case
which
arose
in
california
in
the
early
1980s.
in
light
of
the
record
we
cannot
doubt
the
sincerity
of
the
boy
scouts’
view.
next,
we
must
determine
whether
dale’s
presence
in
the
boy
scouts
would
significantly
burden
the
organizations’
message.
dale
by
his
own
admission
is
one
of
a
group
of
gay
scouts
who
have
become
leaders
in
their
community
and
are
open
and
honest
about
their
sexual
orientation.
dale
was
a
co-president
of
a
gay
and
lesbian
organization
at
college
and
remains
a
gay
rights
activist.
we
conclude
that
his
presence
would
force
the
boy
scouts
to
send
a
message
it
does
not
desire
to
send
that
the
boy
scouts
accepts
homosexual
conduct
as
a
legitimate
form
of
behavior.
finally,
having
determined
that
the
boy
scouts
is
an
expressive
association
and
that
the
forced
inclusion
of
dale
would
significantly
affect
the
organization’s
expression,
we
must
inquire
whether
the
first
amendment
has
been
violated?
in
making
this
inquiry
we
place
the
associational
interest
in
the
freedom
of
expressive
association
on
this
one
side
of
the
scale,
and
the
state’s
interest
on
the
other.
and
in
balancing
the
competing
considerations
we
conclude
that
the
state
interest
embodied
new
jersey’s
public
accommodations
law
do
not
outweigh
the
severe
intrusion
on
the
boy
scouts'
rights
to
freedom
of
expressive
association.
justice
stevens'
dissent
observes
that
homosexuality
is
gaining
greater
social
acceptance,
but
this
is
scarcely
an
argument
for
denying
first
amendment
protection
to
those
who
do
not
accept
these
views.
the
first
amendment
protects
expression,
be
it
of
the
popular
variety
or
not.
the
fact
that
an
idea
may
be
embraced
and
advocated
by
increasing
numbers
of
people
is
all
the
more
reason
to
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
of
those
who
wish
to
voice
a
different
view.
we
are
not
guided
by
our
views
of
whether
the
boy
scouts’
teachings
with
respect
to
homosexual
conduct
are
right
or
wrong.
as
we
said
in
our
decision
in
hurley
several
terms
ago,
“while
the
law
is
free
to
promote
all
sorts
of
conduct
in
place
of
harmful
behavior
it
is
not
free
to
interfere
with
speech
for
no
better
reason
in
promoting
an
approved
message
or
discouraging
a
disfavored
one".
however,
enlightened
either
purpose
may
strike
the
government.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
join;
