mr.
evan
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
a
neutral
civil
rights
law
of
general
applicability
that
is
aimed
at
discriminatory
practices,
not
expression.
the
law
protects
gay
and
nongay
people
within
new
jersey
against
discrimination
based
on
their
sexual
orientation.
although
it
is
one
of
the
least
private
public
accommodations
in
the
country,
bsa
is
here
today
asking
this
court
to
specially
excuse
it
from
compliance
with
that
content-neutral--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--actually,
that
would
not
follow,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
because--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--the
new
jersey
law
itself,
your
honor,
specifically
creates
an
exemption
for
those
public
accommodations
that
are
reasonably
restricted,
in
the
statute's
words,
to
single
status,
and
therefore
the
statute
itself
recognizes
that
there
may
be
instances
in
which
an
organization
that
is
nevertheless
a
public
accommodation
does
not
fall
within
the
sex
proscription
otherwise
in
the
statute.
mr.
evan
wolfson
well,
in
that
unlikely
event,
justice
souter,
that
they
were
to
actually
drop
this
exception,
which
clearly
is
embedded
in
the
law,
that
would...
it
still
would
not
follow,
and
this
court
certainly
need
not
reach
that
decision
here
today,
because
even
were
an
organization
under
that
public
accommodations
obligation,
they
would
nevertheless
then
be
able
to
make
a
first
amendment
argument
with
regard
to
the
burden
on
their
expressive
purposes
and
their
ability
to
delivery
their
message,
and
that
would
be
the
case
that
would
then
be
before
the
court
on
whatever
record
exists
there.
mr.
evan
wolfson
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not.
mr.
evan
wolfson
they
do
not,
and
in
fact--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well,
actually,
your
honor,
there's
far
more
in
the
record
with
regard
to
boy
scouts'
self-identity
and
purposes
and
concepts,
and
perhaps
their
peda...
excuse
me...
pedagogical
approach,
et
cetera,
that
relates
to
boys,
beginning
with
the
name
of
the
organization,
right
on,
than
there
is
in
this
record
at
all
with
regard
to
any
effort
to
convey
the
asserted,
implicit
view
on
homosexuality
that,
as
several
questions
of
the
court
indicated,
is
not
reflected--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well,
to
answer
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
the
best
i
can
come
up
with
regard
to
the
admission
of
girls
is
that
obviously
that
question
is
not
presented
before
this
court,
and
the
statute
itself,
and
the
legislature
in
enacting
the
statute,
clearly
intended
to
proscribe
sex
descrimination
of
the
kind
reflected
in
this
court's
precedent,
acknowledged
in
this
court's
precedents
with
regard
to
jaycees
and
others,
acknowledged
that
nevertheless
there
may
be
some
programs
and
some
institutions
that
are
able
to
show
a
reasonable
restriction
to
single
sex.
this
court
need
not
reach
the
question
on
this
record,
and
i'm
certainly
not
here
to
defend
any
such
exclusion,
but
this
court,
in
ruling
for
mr.
dale,
would
have
to...
would
be
addressing
the
record
here,
which
shows
an
absence
of
any
burden
on
boy
scouts'
ability
to
convey
or
express
any
message
with
regard
to
sexual
orientation
or
homosexuality
which
the
record
reflects,
in
fact,
is
not
conveyed
to
youth
members
and
is
not
conveyed
to
any
adult
member
or
sponsoring
organization
or
scout
master
to
communicate
to
the
youth,
and
that
is
the
much
stronger
record
that
supports
our
position
here.
mr.
evan
wolfson
what
the
state
of
new
jersey--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--that's...
if
that
organization
were
a
public
accommodation,
your
honor,
that
had
opened
itself
to
all,
that
falls
within
the
category
of
meeting
those
criteria,
then
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
the
statute
proscribes,
what
new
jersey
has
prohibited,
is
identity-based
discrimination
by--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--i
have
two
answers
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
the
first
is
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
state's
important
interest
in
eliminating
discrimination,
as
roberts
said,
in
the
political,
econmomic,
and
cultural
life,
and
opportunities
that
present
to
people
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
people,
is
limited
to
the
commercial
sphere,
and
there
are
good
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
so
limited.
my
second
answer
would
be
that
your
honor
in
the
jaycees
case,
as,
obviously,
you're
aware,
talked
about
the
importance
of
the
significance
when
an
association
chooses
its
market,
but
in
your
opinion
and,
i
think,
correctly
broadened
beyond
that,
the
choice
of
a
market
does
not
only
refer
to
a
choice
to
enter
the
commercial
sphere,
and
this--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well,
first
of
all,
we
do
not
honor,
mr.
chief
justice...
sorry.
we
do
not
argue,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
compelling
interest
is
required
here.
the
first
step
in
the
analysis
would
be
any
burden
on
the
specific
expressive
purposes
of
the
organization
seeking
to
exercise
its
burden
of
showing
an
exemption
from
the
statute,
and
then
the
court,
if
necessary,
would
proceed
to
weigh
that
against
a
state's
interest,
but
those
need
not
be
compelling.
but
to
specifically
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
determination
as
to
what
is
entitled
to
strict
scrutiny,
and
in
that
meaning
of
the
word
compelling,
with
regard
to
federal
constitutional
law,
is
not
the
same
compellingness,
or
significance
of
interest
that
the
court
would
assess
with
regard
to
assessing
the
state's
interests
against
discrimination.
mr.
evan
wolfson
well,
as
this
court
has
clearly
acknowledged,
for
example,
in
the
romer
case
and
in
the
hurley
case,
where
it
talked
about
the
legitimacy
and
appropriateness
of
state
civil
rights
laws
that
include
sexual
orientation
discrimination
within
the
cluster
of
prohibited
classifications,
in
romer
the
court--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--i
think
on
this
record
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
except
that
i
would
say
that
i
think
this
court
would
look
to
factors
like,
for
example,
the
history
of
discriminiation
that
has
disadvantaged
people
according
to
a
particular
classification,
and
every
court
that
is--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor,
as
the
jaycees
case
and
others
recognize.
mr.
evan
wolfson
no,
your
honor.
the
first
step
that
the
court
looks
to
is
whether
the
organization
is
the
kind
of
organization
that
qualifies
as
a
public
accommodation.
mr.
evan
wolfson
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
wolfson
the
constitutional
question
that
would
be
before
the
court
in
that
case,
as
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
organization
has
born
its
heavy
burden
of
winning
an
excuse
from
compliance
with
the
law
based
on
its
ability
to
show,
as
the
roberts
and
other
cases
make
clear,
a
specific
expressive
purpose
that
brings
its
members
together
that
is
being
significantly
burdened
by
the
exercise--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well,
that
may
very
well
be
the
kind
of
criterion
that
would
have
taken
it
out
of
being
a
public--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--right.
there
are
two
ways
that
i
would
answer
that
question,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is
to
say
that
the
approach
set
forth
in
the
roberts
trilogy,
in
the
cases
in
which
these
same
kinds
of
claims
have
been
assessed,
is
that
the
court
looks
first
for
that
specific
expressive
purpose
that
brings
the
members
together,
not
simply
the
views
that
some
may
happen
to
hold,
and
not
simply
a
policy
or
a
practice
of
discrimination.
that's,
of
course,
present
in
every
case.
that's
why
we're
in
litigation
in
the
first
place.
the
court
does
a
limited,
threshold
inquiry,
according
to
the
roberts
line
of
cases,
to--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--right.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--is
a--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--what
new
jersey
has
prohibited,
justice
scalia,
is
identity-based
discrimination
in
its
membershp
practices.
it
has
not
limited
what
boy
scouts
may
say.
it
has
not
limited
its
ability
to
express
whatever
message
it
wishes
to
express.
it
has
not
limited
its
ability
to
require
that
members--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--assuming,
arguendo
for
your
question,
that
they
have
established
that
is
such
a
message
and
such
a
purpose
that
they
wish
to
convey...
i
will
assume
that
to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia...
nevertheless,
a
human
being
such
as
mr.
dale
is
not
speech.
a
human
being
is
certainly
not
speech
as
to
a
view,
or
as
to
a
message,
other
than
perhaps
the
message,
i
am
who
i
am,
i
am
here,
and
this
court
has
taken
great--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well,
no.
what's
going
on
here,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
bsa
bears
the
obligation
of
showing
that
it
needs
a
first
amendment
shield
to
excuse
it
from
this
neutral
law,
content-neutral
law.
mr.
evan
wolfson
i
accepted
that
for
the
arguendo,
for
the
purposes
of--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--answering
justice
scalia's
question.
mr.
evan
wolfson
what
this
court
would
look
to,
as
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
looks
to,
is
the
record
as
to
what
burden
is
placed
on
the
organization's
members'
ability
to
deliver
the
specific
expressive
purpose
for
which
they
come
together.
that's
what
the
right
protects.
mr.
evan
wolfson
well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
how
the
public
accommodations
law
would
be
interpreted
with
regard
to
those
organizations,
but
accepting
that
arguendo,
the
question
before
the
court
would
be,
is
there
a
specific
expressive
purpose
of
those
organizations
that
is
impaired
or
infringed,
warranting--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--and
if
i
may,
i
just
want--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
evan
wolfson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
as
an
instrumental
right
in
furtherance
of
the
expression
of
the
members.
mr.
evan
wolfson
that
was
the
statement
of
this
court
in
jaycees,
for
example,
your
honor.
this
court
has
declined,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
recognize
some
kind
of
free-floating
of
freedom
to
disassociation
that
can
be
exercised
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
expressive
purpose
as
a
defense
against
civil
rights
laws,
for
that
would
swallow
civil
rights
laws,
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
jaycees
case
and
others.
mr.
evan
wolfson
i'm
sorry.
i
mean
to
say
expressive
association.
mr.
evan
wolfson
i
totally
agree,
justice
kennedy.
i'm
certainly
not
arguing
that
at
all.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
creation
and
implementation
of
public
accommodations
laws
fulfilling
those
important
interests
is
a
legitimate
and
important
exercise
of
a
state's
power,
and
what
is
at
issue
here,
justice
kennedy,
then
is,
has
this
organization
shown
that
for
its
first
amendment
expressive
purposes
there
is
a
burden
on
its
ability
to
convey
its
messages
warranting
excusal
from
that
law.
of
course,
the
first
amendment
would
trump
the
public
accommodations
law
in
such
a
setting,
but
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
it
will
not
simply
allow
the
mere
statement,
we
don't
want
to
comply
with
the
civil
rights
law,
to
be
the
exception
that
defeats
the
civil
rights
law.
mr.
evan
wolfson
it
certainly
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
to
ask
that
hypothetical
gives
an
example
of
the--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
i
understood
the
hypothetical
you
were
giving,
there
were
two
elements
in
it.
mr.
evan
wolfson
one
was
this
establishment
of
a
specific
expressive--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--purpose
that
has
in
fact
not
been
shown
here--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--with
the
additional
point
that
the
organization
is
actually
requiring
that
it
be
conveyed
to
members
and
others.
mr.
evan
wolfson
no,
justice
souter,
although
we
do
make
that
argument,
and
make
that
point,
and
that
is
the
threshold
inquiry
that
the
roberts
case
and
others
has
said
this
court--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--well,
i'm
making
two
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
they
did
have
an
ample
opportunity
to
put
forth
the
millions
of
pages
of
documents.
this
is
not
an
organization
that's
shy
about
publishing,
as
the
court
has
seen,
and
there's
literally
nothing
there.
but
beyond
that,
justice
ginsburg,
this
court
need
not
even
come
to
that
point,
and
this
is
what
i
was
starting
to
want
to
continue
with
with
justice
souter,
which
is
that
even
were
you
to
assume
that
they
have
the
implicit
moral
they
say
they
have,
what
they
have
failed
to
show
is
that
their
expressive
messages,
that
their
activities
are
burdened,
and
that
they...
and
they
further
have
to
be
able
to
show--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--then
that
would
go
the
point
raised
by
justice
o'connor's
question
quite
a
time...
some
time
ago
and
picked
up
by
other
members
of
this
court,
which
is
that
they
in
fact
permit,
and
the
record
is
undisputed
on
this,
nongay
members
and
nongay
sponsoring
organizations,
including
the
amici
and
others
who
participate--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--it
would
be
correct
they
would
then
have
a
stronger
showing
of
an
expressive
message,
but
that
is
only
one
piece
of
what
they
need
to
show--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--what
they
still
would
have
had...
well,
that's
correct
up
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it
shows
the
significant
burden
that
then
gets
to--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--that's
correct,
but--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--this
court
should
also--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--actually,
justice
scalia,
there
is
most
likely
a
reason
why
they
have
not...
why
they
in
fact
concede
in
their
own
brief
that
they
are
not
an
antigay
organization,
and
they
do
not
require
members
and
sponsors
and
scout
masters
to
inveigh
against
homosexuality,
or
to
teach
anything
about
sexual
orientation--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--and
the
reason
for
that,
justice
scalia,
is
not
so
much
that
they're
afraid
of
losing
the
gay
people.
it's
that
they
are
afraid
of
losing
the
nongay
people
who,
as
justice
o'connor's
question
pointed
out,
do
not
agree
with
this
policy,
whose
charter
is
renewed
year
after
year
after
year,
despite
their
not
sharing
this
moral
view,
or
having
disagreement
over
this,
because
that's
not
why
they
come
into
scouting.
mr.
evan
wolfson
but
what
this
court--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--it's
their
burden,
justice
scalia,
to
show
that
their
specific
expressive
purposes,
not
simply
views
they
hold
implicitly,
but
the
expressive
purposes
of
conveying
any
such
views,
are
significantly
burdened,
and
then
that
those
outweigh
the
state's
interest
in
this
neutral
law.
the
state--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--they
certainly
draw
in
many
other
strands,
free
exercise
or
other
principles
that
would
protect
them
as
well.
mr.
evan
wolfson
beginning
with
the
exception
in
the
statute
and
on,
justice--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
mr.
evan
wolfson
no.
mr.
evan
wolfson
well,
in
the
unlikely
event
that
it
were
a
public
accommodation,
which
it
would
not
be,
then
what
we
also
have
operating
with
religion,
and
perhaps
this
goes
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
that
that's
addressing
people
on
the
basis
of
views.
it's
addressing
people
on
the
basis
of
message
and
expression.
it
is
not
the
identity-based
discrimination.
mr.
evan
wolfson
yes.
mr.
evan
wolfson
certainly,
if--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
know
that
it
turns
on
centrality
so
much
as
it
turns
on,
in
the
words
of
the
court
in
the
roberts
trilogy,
specific
expressive
purpose,
and
the
things
that
this
court
would
look
to
are,
in
the
threshold
inquiry
would
look
to
what
does
the
record
show
with
regard
to
purposes
that
bring
the
members
together?
who
are
the
members?
what
are
they
saying?
what
are
they
stating?
in
the
case
here
we
have
the
amici,
who
clearly
do
not
agree,
and
who
constitute
a
huge
share,
not
to
mention
the
public
entities,
of
the
sponsors
and
members
and
participants
of
this
organization.
but
my
further
argument
is
that
even
where
you
assume
arguendo
that
they
have
this
implicit
moral
view,
what
the
record
clearly
shows
here
is
that
they
do
not
require
any
scout
master
or
sponsoring
entity
or
whatever
to
convey
that
to
youth,
and
in
that
case
it's
an
easy
determination
for
this
court
to
see
that
there's
no
burden
on
this
conveying
of
expressive
message
central,
specific
or
otherwise,
because
they
themselves
do
not
convey
it.
they
themselves
don't
do
it,
and
therefore
these--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--but
mr.
dale
is
not
here
to
advocate
that
he
be
allowed
to
advocate
that
gays
are
okay
within
scouting,
nor
does
new
jersey
tell
the
boy
scouts
what
they
can
or
can't
say
within
scouting,
nor
does
it
tell
them
that
they
can't
limit
what
is
said
within
scouting.
what
it
tells
them
is,
identity-based
discrimination,
the
equation
of
a
human
being
with
forced
speech,
or
a
speech,
or
an
assumed
message,
is
off
the
table.
mr.
evan
wolfson
well,
in
this
specific
case,
your
honor,
mr.
dale
was
expelled
for
taking
part
in
a
seminar
outside
of
scouting,
in
which
he
made
no
connection
to
scouting,
in
which
he
asserted
a
view
that,
as
questions
have
indicated,
had
nongay
people
asserted
them,
would
have
been
perfectly
fine
and
they
would
be
entitled
to
remain
in
scouting.
mr.
evan
wolfson
actually,
justice
souter,
the
record
is
crystal
clear
with
regard
to
all
the
amici,
all
of
the
sponsoring
organizations,
from
the
united
methodist
church
to
the
reform
jewish
groups,
to
the
public
schools
and
others,
who
make
clear
that
their
charter
is
renewed
year
after
year,
despite
their
difference...
in
fact,
their
not
even
knowing
that
this
was
part
of
the
alleged
expressive
purpose
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
conveying,
and--
mr.
evan
wolfson
--actually,
justice
scalia,
it
is
indeed
the
group
that
conducts...
what
boy
scouts
does
is
franchise
its
program...
that's
its
word...
to
the
sponsoring
entities
who
own
and
operate,
scouting
says,
the
scouting
program.
mr.
evan
wolfson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
