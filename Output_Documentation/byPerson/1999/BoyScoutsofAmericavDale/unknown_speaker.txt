well,
no
one
thinks
that...
or
has
suggested
that
this
makes
you
a
state
actor,
so
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
out,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
new
jersey
law
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
schools
and
the
fire
departments,
to
comply
with
the
new
jersey
law
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court,
would
have
to
sever
the
relation.

one
of
the
briefs
does,
the
city
of
boston,
includes
in
its
prohibition
against
discrimination
ex-convicts.

you
think
it
does
not
limit
the
ability
of
the
boy
scouts
to
convey
its
message
to
require
the
boy
scouts
to
have
as
a
scout
master
someone
who
embodies
a
contradiction
of
its
message,
whether
the
person
wears
a
sign
or
not?
