--well,
where
do
we
look,
though,
to
determine
what
the
policy
is,
because
it
is
a
little
confusing,
and
let
me
add
another
question
to
the
mix,
and
maybe
you
can
clarify
for
us
where
we
look.
what
about
the
heterosexual
scout
leader
who
openly
espouses
the
view
that
homosexuality
is
consistent
with
scout
law
and
oath,
and
that
it's
not
immoral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
about
that
person,
and
where
do
we
look
to
see
what
the
boy
scout
position
is
on
these
things?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
two
people
who
live
together
but
they're
not
married.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
not
at
issue
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
alleged,
and
that's
not
the
basis
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
now,
clarify
for
me,
because
i...
it
is
not
clear
to
me
yet.
a
heterosexual
male
adult
who
wants
to
be
a
scout
leader
who
openly
espouses
the
view
that
homosexuality
is
not
immoral,
and
that
it
is
consistent
with
scout
law
and
oath,
is
that
person
qualified
for
membership
as
a
troop
leader?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
also
whether
it
makes
any
difference
in
the
balance
that
the
court
strikes
that
the
scouts
are
a
federally
chartered
institution
and
that
government
entities
such
as
schools
and
fire
departments
and
police
departments
and
so
on
sponsor
troop
units?
does
that
make
a
difference,
particularly
if
the
governmental
unit
itself
takes
the
position
that
it
would
disagree
with
this
determination
that
the
boy--
justice
sandra

o'connor
mr.
wolfson,
i
suppose
literally
the
policy
of
new
jersey
would
require
the
boy
scouts
to
admit
girls
as
well.
i
mean,
that's
a
status
based
on
the
sex
of
the
young
woman,
and
presumably
your
position
would
be
they'd
have
to
take
girls
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
a
status?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
about
a
gay
or
lesbian
group
that
takes
the
position
that
it
does
not
want
heterosexual
members
to
participate,
or
be
admitted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
presumably
think
that
this
law
would
prevent
that
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
at
all
in
application
of
such
a
policy
to
commercial
entities
and
groups,
as
opposed
to
private
membership
groups?
does
that
weigh
in
the
balance
at
all?
i
mean,
i
can
well
understand
how
a
public
accommodation
law
should
apply
to
commercial
groups,
or
even
to
groups
such
as
jaycees,
which
essentially
depend
on
a
commercial
nexus
for
its
membership.
