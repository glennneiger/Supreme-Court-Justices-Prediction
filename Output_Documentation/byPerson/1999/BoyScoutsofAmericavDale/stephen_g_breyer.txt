justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
anything
happen
here,
other
than
what's
in
the
complaint,
which
i
take
it
was
that
mr.
dale,
sometime
in
the
past,
was
a
member
of
the
gay
alliance
at
a
university,
gave
some
seminars,
was
interviewed
then,
and
it
was
in
the
newspaper.
then
he
received
a
letter
of
termination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
yes,
but
there's
nothing
other
than
that,
and
when
you
use
the
word
open,
that's
what
open
refers
to,
is
talking
to
the
newspaper
reporter
about
his
previous
membership
in
the
gay
alliance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're...
are
we
thinking
of
the
same
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
thinking
of
a
seminar
that
he
was
at,
and
there
was
a
newspaper
article
about
him,
is
that
right,
which
is
in
the
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
on
the
basis
of
that
that
he's
terminated,
and
when
you
use
the
word
open,
you're
referring
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
now,
if
a
similar
person
had
said
every
word
exactly
the
same,
but
he
was
not
gay,
and
it
was...
would
he
be
terminated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course,
it's
always
open
to
the
scouts
to
decide
whom
they're
going
to
hire
and
not,
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
is
there
a
policy
that
it
would
be
identical
were
that
person
not
gay?
everything's
the
same,
newspaper
article,
et
cetera.
it
just
happens
that
the
person
being
heterosexual
says,
and
i
think
it's
great,
i
think
it's
fine,
okay.
that's
all.
he
did
that
at
college.
would
the
scouts
terminate
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
ask.
i
mean,
if
it
never
comes
out,
you
don't
make
any
effort
to
find
out,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
how
are
we
supposed
to
know...
and
this
is
genuinely
bothering
me.
i
don't...
how
are
we
supposed
to
know
whether
the
basic
principle
that
the
scouts
is
operating
on
is
thinking
that
this
is
very,
very
bad
conduct,
or
is
simply
being
quite
concerned
about
public
reaction?
i
mean,
if
it
were
very,
very
bad
conduct,
it's
surprising
you
don't
look
into
it,
but
if
what
you're
concerned
about
is
public
reaction,
it
all
makes
quite
a
lot
of
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
basic
question
is,
how
do
i
know,
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
out
whether
the
policy
reflects
very
great
concern
about
the
conduct,
or
reflects
very
great
concern
about
public
reaction?
that
was
my
question,
and
how
do
we
decide
the
mix
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
something
i
was
going
to
figure
out
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm...
though
i'm
interested
in
your
view,
if
you
think
this
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
it
apply,
do
you
think,
or
should
the
weight
we
give
it
in
the
context
of
a
first
amendment
claim
be
the
same
for
a
purely
private
organization?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
in
your
view
a
catholic
organization
has
to
admit
jews,
a
jewish
organization
has
to
admit
catholics,
and
you
can't
have...
i
mean,
there
are
many.
the
b'nai
b'rith
has
to
have...
oh,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
they
do
or
not,
but
i
mean,
it
seems
odd.
that's
your
view
of
the
constitutional
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
look
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
the
state
of
new
jersey
were
to
say
our
poublic
accommodations
law
applies
to
the
knights
of
columbus,
b'nai
b'rith,
every
possible
organization,
if
they
were
to
say
that,
look
to
that,
what
would
we
do
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
need...
suppose
that
it
says
this
is
basically
a
jewish
orgnaization,
or
this
is
basically
a
catholic
organization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
is.
suppose
it
is.
then
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
that's
so,
if
that's
what
we're
supposed
to
do,
then
how
are
we
supposed
to
determine,
in
your
opinion,
whether
or
not
the
relationship
of
the
antigay
to
the
boy
scouts
is
or
is
not
fundamental,
or
core,
in
the
way
that
the...
in
the
way
that
i've
just
described
in
respect
to
other
organizations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
do
that?
that
is,
i'm
back
to
justice
scalia's
earlier
question,
and
the
chief's.
maybe
you've
answered
it.
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
we
both
agree
that
a
basically
jewish
or
a
basically
catholic
organization,
expression
or
not,
maybe
association,
would
be
immune
under
the
first
amendment.
b'nai
b'rith,
knights
of
columbus,
et
cetera.
i
mean,
you
know...
don't
we
agree
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
agree
that
those
basically
religious
groups,
religiously
oriented
groups
don't
have
to
admit
people
of
the
other
religion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forgetting
the
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
was...
maybe
we
don't
agree
on
the
assumption...
that
if
there
are
some
groups,
say
religiously
oriented
groups
that
could
keep
out
people
of
the
other
religion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
on
the
other
hand
if
you
take
these
basic
organizing
principles
and
push
them
to
the
periphery,
so
that
now
they're
only
a
peripheral
principle,
and
you
accept
that,
you
could
submerge
all
civil
rights
laws?
you
said
that
at
one
point.
in
other
words,
if
you
take
what
is
a
basic
principle,
and
say
the
same
law
applies
if
it's
just
a
secondary
or
tertiary
or
sort
of
peripheral
principle,
if
we
accept
that
as
an
excuse,
there
will
be
no
civil
rights
laws
left.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
fine.
if...
so
i
thought
we
were
agreeing
about
those
two
things,
and
then
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
court
is
supposed
to
do
to
figure
out
when
an
association
claims
that
a
principle
is
very
important,
whether
it
is
really
central,
or
whether
it
is
one
of
these
things
that
you
call
peripheral,
or
tertiary,
that
it
would
submerge
the
civil
rights
laws.
are
we
supposed
to...
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
that
out?
