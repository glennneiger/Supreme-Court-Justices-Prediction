justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
defending
an
expressive
policy,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
confusing.
are
you
saying
the
policy
is
don't
ask,
don't
tell,
or
is
the
policy,
if
you
are
gay
you
are
not
wlecome
in
the
boy
scouts?
which
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
somebody
who
was
homosexual
and
celibate,
but
who
said,
in
my
view
it
isn't
morally
wrong,
would
such
a
person
be
excluded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
again
you're
saying
it's
not
the
status
of
being
gay
or
being
candid
about
who
you
are
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
i'm...
i
just...
i
don't
understand
what
is
the
boy
scouts'
policy,
and
i
think
we've
all
asked
about
that.
is
it...
i
took
it
from
one
of
your
answers
that
it
is
don't
ask,
don't
tell.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
go
for
cohabiters
also?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
people
who
live
together,
heterosexual
unions
but
not
blessed
by
marriage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean...
just,
the
incidence
of
living
together
before
marriage
is
not
so
uncommon
these
days.
i
didn't
refer
to
an
adulterer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
were
some
briefs
that
suggested
that
boy
scout
troops
who
had
taken
the
position
not
simply
inside
boy
scout
councils,
but
openly,
that
they
welcomed
scout
leaders
without
regard
to
sexual
orientation.
the
chapters...
troops
had
been
open
about
that,
and
yet
their
charters
hadn't
been
revoked.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
saying
that
it...
that
a
troop
could
only
within
the
boy
scouts'
own
councils,
not
in
discussion
with
the
young
members
of
the
troops,
and
not
to
the
general
public.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is...
you
are
relying
on
cases
that
involve
exclusion
of
women,
and
there's
a
certain
irony
in
that
you're
relying
on
the
jaycees
case
and
the
rotary
case,
and
this
statute
of
new
jersey
does
include
sex,
as
well
as
sexual
orientation,
and
i
don't
even
think
new
jersey
has
said
that
the
exception
would
cover
such
an
organization.
you're
speculating
that
it
might,
but
is
the
best
that
you
could
come
up
with
is
that
the
boy
scouts
have
an
expressive
policy
against...
i
don't
know
what.
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just
on
that
point,
because
it
seems
to
me
disturbing,
when
this
case
went
off
on
summary
judgment,
and
the
fact
that
there
were
cross-motions.
if
i
move
for
summary
judgment,
i
say
my
case
is
so
strong
i
should
get
summary
judgment,
no
trial
is
needed.
but
if
i
lose
on
that,
it
doesn't
go
that
necessarily
then
judgment
must
be
entered
against
me,
because
i
can
say,
i
think
this
record
is
so
clear
that
i
win,
but
if
it's
not
all
that
clear,
then
give
me
the
chance
to
show
that
this
is
really
what
my
policy
is,
and
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case,
did
it?
i
mean,
there
were...
the...
both
sides
were
so
sure
of
their
positions
they
moved
for
summary
judgment,
and
so
when
you
talk
about,
well,
they
didn't
prove,
i'm
a
little
uneasy,
because
there
was
no
trial
giving
them
that
opportunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
there
seems
to
be
some
conflict
on
that
point,
because
i
believe
counsel
for
the
boy
scouts
told
us...
he
referred
us
to
a
page
in
the
record
that
that
one
troop...
its
charter
was
continued
only
when
it
agreed
that
it
was
going
to
have...
adhere
to
this
policy,
and
that
it
wasn't
going
to
advocate
gays
are
okay.
