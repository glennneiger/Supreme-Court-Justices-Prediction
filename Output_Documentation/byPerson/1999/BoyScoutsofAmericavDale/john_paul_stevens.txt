justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
right
there,
is
it
the
position
that
a
person
who
is
a
homosexual,
engages
in
homosexual
conduct,
cannot
fit
that
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
follow-up
question
to
the
one
i
asked
before...
if
homosexual
conduct
violates
the
scout
code,
being
straight
and
so
forth,
why
is
it
relevant
whether
the
man
is
open
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
assume
the
scouts
find
out
about
a
person
but
he
hasn't...
he
just
unwittingly
let
them
find
out,
not
intending
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
policy
is
not
limited
to
open
gays.
it's
limited
to
all
people--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
my
case
is
the
one
where
it's
found
out
against
the
wishes
of
the
person
who
wanted
to
keep
it
secret,
and
wanted
not
to
let
the
boys
in
the
scout
troop
know
about
it,
but
the
administration
finds
out
about
it.
as
i
understand
your
position,
he
would
be
treated
just
like
this
man.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
saying
that
if
the
church
was
a
public
accommodation
they
could
keep
out
non-catholics?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
if
a
church
were
a
public
accommodation...
i'm
not
suggesting
a
state
would
do
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that,
but
here
we've
got...
that
the
church
could
then
deny
admission
to
the
church,
to
non-catholics,
the
catholic
church?
