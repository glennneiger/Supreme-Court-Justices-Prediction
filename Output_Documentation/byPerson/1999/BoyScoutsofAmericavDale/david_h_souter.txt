justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
a
boy
scout...
well,
let's
just
keep
it
at
troop
leaders
for
now.
if
a
troop
leader
simply
said
to
other
officials,
not
to
the
newspapers,
not
in
any
public
forum
anywhere,
i
am
a
homosexual,
would
he
be
excluded
from
his
leadership
position
for
that
alone?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
mean,
you
may
want
to
elaborate
on
that,
but
if
he
simply
says,
i
am
a
homosexual,
would
he
be
excluded
from
a
leadership
position
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
we
answer
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
fair
to
say,
then,
that
anyone
who
is
openly
homosexual
and
whose
admission,
or
profession
of
that
fact
would
be
likely
to
come
to
the
attention
of
the
boy
scouts
themselves,
be
excluded?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it...
and
i
take
it...
we
may
have
touched
on
this,
but
i
take
it
that
the
position
that
you've
just
described
is
not
stated
anywhere
in
a
boy
scouts
manual,
or
even
a
troop
leader
manual?
this
is
in
effect
sort
of
boy
scout
common
law.
it's
determined
by
the
council,
and
the
council
makes
individual
decisions,
and
that's
the
way
the
policy
is
expressed,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
general
principle
is,
but
this
particular
application
of
the
scouts'
view
of
the
principle
i
take
it
is
not
stated
in
any
official
manual,
either
the
handbook
for
boys
that
the
scouts
get,
or
a
troop
leader's
manual,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
take
it
you've
just
touched
on
something
that
i
think...
again,
i
think
i
understand
your
position,
but
i
want
to
be
clear.
i
understand
that
the
scouts'
position
on
this
does
not
in
any
way
depend
on
a
judgment
that
mr.
dale
is...
presents
or
would
present
an
undue
risk
of
homosexual
conduct
with
the
scouts
in
his
troop,
is
that
correct?
it's
not
a
fear
of
conduct?
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
davidson,
let
me
tell
you
one
of
the
problems
that
i've
got
under
the
expressive
association
claim,
and
that
is
in
weighing
the
strength
of
your
interest
under
the
first
amendment
as
against
the
state's
claimed
interest,
if
we
get
to
that
point,
and
it's
quite
true,
as
you've
made
it
plain,
and
justice
scalia's
question
made
plain,
that
the
official
publications,
the
things
that
we
immediately
look
to,
the
handbook,
the
material
that's
routinely
given
to
scout
masters,
does
not
expressly
address
this
problem,
and
it
does
not
expressly
address
the
problem
of
ax
murderers
or
adulterers
and
so
on.
but
we're
at
a
point
where
this
has
become
a
fairly
serious
issue
for
the
scouts.
you've
had
a
lot
of
litigation
on
it,
and
here
you
are
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
and
shouldn't
we...
or
maybe
we
shouldn't...
find
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
the
scouts
have
not
officially
addressed
this
in
any
of
their
publications
and
taken
an
explicit
stand
in
the
various
manuals
that
it
puts
out.
is
that
something
that
we
should
fairly
consider
in
weighting
the
scouts'
expressive
interest
on
this
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that...
i
mean,
i
ask
the
question
in
terms
of
the
expressive
association
claim.
you're...
the
problem
in
simply
drawing
a
parallel
to
hurley
is
that
we're
not
at
the
point
where
anyone
is
using
the
boy
scouts,
or
proposing
to
use
the
boy
scouts
for
expression.
mr....
the...
mr.
dale
has
not,
in
effect,
asked
to
carry
a
banner.
he's
saying,
i'm
not
going
to
carry
a
banner,
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
it,
so
there's
a
little
difficulty
with
the
hurley
analogy.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
effect...
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
you're
saying
he
has
created
a
kind
of
public
persona
for
himself
and
therefore
simply
for
him
to
be
in
the
scouts
in
that
position
does
carry
a
message,
and
i
understand
that,
that
that's
different
from
hurley.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
we
accept
your
position
and
new
jersey
changes
its
law,
new
jersey
drops
its
exemption,
then,
i
take
it,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
it
would
fall
out
that
the
boy
scouts
would
have
to
admit
girls.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
don't
have
an
antigirl
message,
do
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
they're
saying
that
they
do
have...
however
they
may
have
expressed
it,
they
do
have
an
antihomosexual
expression
message,
so
i
suppose
in
the
case
of
the
girl
who
wanted
to
be
admitted
their
position
would
be
weaker
than
it
is
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
assume,
then,
that
the
boy
scouts
tomorrow
morning
take
formal
steps
to
amend
all
of
their
official
statements
of
objective,
and
they
say
in
the
boy
scout
manual,
the
troop
leader's
manuals
and
so
on,
that
it
is
essential
to
our
objective
of
moral
decency
that
homosexual
conduct
not
be
permitted,
and
that
those
who
avowedly
engage
in
it
or
believe,
indeed,
that
it
is
appropriate,
may
not
be
members
of
the
organization.
would
your
case,
on
your
view,
then
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
new
jersey
law
does
not
change.
the
new
jersey
law
in
effect
is
saying
that
you
may
not
make
these
kinds
of
status-based
determinations.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
case,
then,
turn
on
the...
sort
of
the
discussion
that
we
were
having
with
your
brother
a
while
ago
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
boy
scouts'
statement
of
its
position
as
essential
to
its
message?
does
it
turn,
then,
on
how
well
they
have
made
their
message
known?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
they
assume
that
they
make
their
message
not
implicit,
as
you
characterized
it,
but
explicit
in
the
way
that
i
suggested
in
my
hypothetical,
is
there
not
then
a
message
which
would
clearly
be
burdened
by
having
avowedly
homosexual
people
in
leadership
positions?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
and
that
might
be
a
very
good
argument
in
that
eventuality,
but
i
take
it
that
the
fact
of
their
having
made
the
message
explicit
would
entitle
them
to
make
a
claim
which
you
think
they're
not
entitled
to
make
here,
and
that
is
that
they
have
a
message
which
is
quite
clearly
being
burdened
by
avowedly
homosexual
people
in
ledership
positions,
and
your
argument
then
would
be,
well,
you're
not
consistent
about
objecting
to
the
burden,
but
they
would
be
able
to
make
a
burden
argument
which,
as
i
understand
it,
you
think
on
this
record
is
illegitimate,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and...
but
doesn't
it
fall
that
if
their
message
is
clear,
the
burden
upon
the
message,
by
putting
an
avowedly
homosexual
person
in
a
leadership
position,
would
be
burdened
in
a
way
that
they
cannot,
on
your
view,
show
it
would...
a
message
would
be
burdened
now.
the
two
sort
of
go
together.
make
the
message
clearer,
the
burden
becomes
clearer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
shows
a
more
significant
burden
than
you
believe
they
are
entitled
to
be
given
credit
for
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
of
course,
they're
saying
that
it's
not
merely
identity-based
discrimination.
they're
saying
it's
advocacy-based,
that
by
making
the
public
statements
that
he
has
made,
he
in
effect
has
put
himself
in
a
position
of
being
identified,
understood
by
people
as
an
advocate,
and
therefore
if
he's
in
a
leadership
position
in
the
scouts,
by
that
very
fact
he's
going
to
carry
sort
of
the
aura
of
the
advocacy
with
him.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
opposing
counsel
i
think
gave
us
an
example
of
nongays
who
were
taking
that
position
who
were
challenged
by
the
scouts
and
backed
down,
so
i
don't
know
whether
the
differential
treatment
is
as
clear
as
i
thought
when
i
came
in
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
have
they...
do
they...
go
ahead.
