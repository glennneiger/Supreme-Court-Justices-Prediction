justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
take
this
case
as
one
in
which
dale
was
terminated
because
of
the
reasonable
likelihood
that
he
would
use
his
position
to
advocate
for
his
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
it
were
simply
called
to
the
scouts'
attention
that
he
was
a
very
private
person,
but
had
said
to
his
family
that
he
was
a
homosexual,
that
he
could
still
be
terminated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
position
of
the
scouts
in
the
case
that
i
have
posited?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
on
the
grounds
that
from
his
status
a
certain
amount
of
advocacy
is
likely?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
without
reference
to
the
likelihood
of
any
public
advocacy?
it's
just
not
necessary
for
us
to
address
when
we
decide
this
case,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
find
that
a
necessary
predicate
for
your
case
here?
that's
all
i'm
trying
to
ask.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
if
he
alleged
in
the
community...
one
moment,
just...
how
about
if
he
just
made
speeches
about
this
in
the
community
as
a
whole?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
proceed
with
the
rest
of
your
argument,
but
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
as
to
what
documents,
what
about
the
1978
memorandum,
i
think
it
was,
that's
quoted
in
the
california
supreme
court
case,
which
is
a
question
and
answer
format,
in
which
a
high
executive
of
the
scouts,
i
had
thought,
indicates
that
homosexuality
in
its
troop
leaders
is
incompatible
with
scouting?
you
didn't
give
that
in
your
answer
to
justice
souter,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seemed
to
me
that
that
was
a
rather
strong
statement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
must
say,
i
found
it
somewhat
difficult
to
assess
the
relevance
of
this
web
of
relations
that
the
boy
scouts
have
in
new
jersey
with
schools
and
fire
departments.
i'm
puzzled
about
what
weight,
if
any,
to
give
to
that.
if
you
prevail
on
your
first
amendment
argument
here,
and
you
prevail
in
this
case,
do
you
think
the
schools
and
the
fire
departments
(a)
would
be
permitted,
or
(b)
required,
under
new
jersey
law,
to
sever
their
relations
with
the
scouts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
answer
to
this
line
of
questioning
seems
to
suppose
a
dichotomy
between
an
entity
that's
a
public
accommodation
and
an
entity
that
has
expressive
rights.
surely
there
can
be
both.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
seem
to
assume
in
your
answer...
i
think
you
assume
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
the
boy
scouts
do
have
a
moral
message.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--who
is
better
qualified
to
determine
the
expressive
purpose
and
expressive
content
of
the
boy
scouts'
message,
the
boy
scouts
or
the
new
jersey
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
scouts
have
made
their
principal
arguments
the
right
of
intimate
association.
they're
arguing
the
right
of
expression.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
almost
all
of
your
answers
it
seems
to
me
that
you
say
once
there
is
a
public
accommodation,
that
right
of
expression
is
somehow
secondary,
or
somehow
must
be
subordinated.
you
simply
cannot
find
that
proposition
in
our
cases.
