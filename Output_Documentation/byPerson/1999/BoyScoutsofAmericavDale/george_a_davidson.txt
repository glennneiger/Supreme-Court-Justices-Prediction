mr.
george
a.
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
freedom
of
a
voluntary
association
to
choose
its
own
leaders.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
state
and
not
boy
scouting
may
decide
who
will
wear
the
scout
leader's
uniform
and
act
as
a
role
model
of
scouting's
values
for
a
group
of
10
to
15
boys
in
a
scout
troop.
far
from
a
business
networking
organization,
boy
scouting
is
so
closely
identified
with
traditional
moral
values
that
the
phrase,
he's
a
real
boy
scout,
has
entered
the
language.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
your
honor,
mr.
dale
had
created
a
reputation
for
himself
by
the
newspaper
article
which
appeared,
and
which...
the
reputation
which
would
have
carried
into
the
troop
meeting
and
affected
his
ability
to
be
a
role
model
to
the
youths
in
his
troop.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
as
mr.
dale
alleges
in
his
complaint
and
reaffirmed
in
his
summary
judgment
affidavit,
scouting
does
not
investigate
the
sexual
orientation
of
applicants
and
only
excludes
those
that
are
open
about
their
sexual
orientation.
the
cases
we
have
had
have
been
people
that
have
been
in
the
newsletter,
or
have
written
a
letter
for
boy
scouts,
were
recruited
as
testers
by
act
up
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
the
case,
your
honor,
as
posited
we
haven't
seen.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
i
would
be
prepared
to
defend
any
decision
they
might
make
in
that
situation.
i
think
that's
their
right
under
the
constitution--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--well,
boy
scouts
is
concerned
about
two
things,
expression
and
conduct
inconsistent
with
the
oath
and
law.
boy
scouts
is
not
concerned
about
status.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
if
the...
whoever
heard
whatever
statement
was
made
learned
that
the
person
intended
to
engage
in
homosexual
conduct
felt
that
that
was
an
appropriate--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
precise
question
hasn't
come
up.
i
believe
that
there
would
be
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
the
policy
is
not
to
inquire.
the
policy
is
to
exclude
those
who
are
open.
that's
alleged
in
the
complaint.
it's
not
been
an
issue
in
the
case.
that's
what
mr.
dale
alleges--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--if
a--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--if
that
person
were
to
advocate
that
position
through
scouting
channels
in
an
effort
to
change
policy,
that
would
be
permissible.
as
the
record
indicates
in
mr.
bishop's
affidavit
and
mr.
kaye's
testimony,
if
such
a
person
were
to
advocate
the
morality
of
homosexual
conduct
to
youth
in
the
program,
that
person
would
be
excluded
and,
indeed,
one
of
mr.
dale's
affiants
was
excluded
on
that
ground.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
scouts
have
general
moral
principles
in
the
morally
straight
and
clean
requirements
of
the
oath
and
law,
and
they
have
to
be
interpreted
by
scout
leaders
in
situations
as
they
have
come
up
and
certainly,
in
the
case
of
those
who
have...
mr.
dale
has
alleged
are
openly
homosexual
are
not
permitted
to
be
scout
leaders,
in
furtherance
of
the
efforts
to
pursue
those
moral
values
in
youth.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
certainly
not
in
mr.
dale's
case,
who
has
really
constantly
reiterated
his
intention
and
desire
to
be
open,
and
has
had
considerable
media
attention
both
before
the
case
was
filed
and
subsequently.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
i'm
saying
that
the
first
amendment
would
protect
application
of
exclusion
of
other
people
in
other
circumstances,
but
they're
not
presented
here
today.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
if
that
person
also
were
to
take
the
view
that
the
reason
they
didn't
engage
in
that
conduct
would
it
would
be
morally
wrong--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--and
that's
the
view
that
would
be
communicated
to
youth,
that
case
has
not
come
up,
but
it's
my
understanding
of
the
policy
that
that
person
would
not
be
excluded.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
sure
i
got
the
nots
right
in
that
question,
but
if
somebody
said
it
was
morally
wrong,
and
that
they
didn't
engage
in
it
but
did
have
homosexual
inclinations,
i
believe
that
that
person
would
be
eligible
for
leadership,
as
i
understand
the
policy.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
it's
about
the
message
that
would
go
to
youth
in
the
program.
the
youth...
in
accordance
with
a
desire
to--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--the
practice
is
not
to
inquire
into
the
sexual
orientation
of
leaders.
the
policy
derives
out
of
the
morally
straight
and
clean
requirements
of
the
law.
there's
formal
position
statements
in
the
record
attached
to
mr.
rowley's
affidavit
that
scouting
requires
homosexual
conduct,
regards
homosexual
conduct
as
immoral
and
for
that
reason
does
not
appoint
openly
homosexual
persons
in
the
role
model
position
of
scout
master.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
quite--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--well,
there's
certainly
adulterers
or
other
people
that
have
engaged
in
heterosexual
behavior
which
boy
scouts
has
not
regarded
as
morally
straight
who
have
been
excluded.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
right.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
i
know
of
no
particular
instances
of
application
of
the
policy
in
that
connection.
i
was
just
trying
to
give
a
more
general
answer
that
heterosexual
conduct
which
is
not
regarded
as
morally
straight
has
resulted
in
the
termination
of
leadership
positions,
or
not
welcoming
someone
into
leadership
in
the
first
place.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
boys
are--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--well,
being
openly
homosexual
in...
communicates
the
concept
that
this
is
okay.
this
is
an
alright
lifestyle
to
pursue.
whether
the--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--absent
some
further
statement
that
it
would
be
immoral
to
act
on
the
impulses,
in
the
culture
in
which
these
statements
are
made
we
talk
about
coming
out.
we
don't
talk
about
coming
out
as
canadian
or
heterosexual
or
anything
else.
this
is
a
statement
fraught
with
moral
meaning.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
the
record
shows,
although
the
actual
article
is
not
in
the
record,
that
in
the
magazine
sent
to
all
adult
scouters
in
1992
there
was
an
article
about
the
policy,
so
it's
not
a
stealth
policy,
but
the
general
principle
of
morally
straight
is
really
very,
very
widely
known
in
the
scouting
movement.
it's--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--well,
in
mr.
dale's
1972
scout
master's
handbook
there
is
a
reference
in
dealing
with
incidence
of
sexual
activity
that
might
occur
in
a
troop
that
speaks
disapprovingly
of
homosexual
conduct,
but
there's
not
a--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--formal
policy
statement
in
the
troop...
in
either
of
those,
of
the
publications,
nor
is
there
anything
about
adultery
or
any
other...
or
a
number
of
other--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
issue
of
possible
sexual
abuse
is
one
that's
very
important
to
scouts.
every
scout
handbook
and
scout
master
handbook
comes
with
an
insert
which
is
in
the
record
at
2248
which
talks
about
sexual
abuse
at
some
length.
it
never
mentions
the
word
homosexual.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
it
says
about
gender
is
that
there's
a
rising
incidence
of
abuse
by
female
adults.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that's--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--not
alleged.
it's
not
the
basis
of
policy
in
any
way.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that
person
could
take
that
position
in
scouting
councils
to
urge
that
a
change
be
made,
but
if
that...
unless
that
person
were
willing
to...
if
that
person
were
to
take
that
position
to
the
youth
in
the
program
and
urge
it
on
the
youth
in
the
program,
that
person
would
not
be
able
to
continue
as
a
scout
leader,
and
that's
why
mr.
rice
was
terminated.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
i
think
this
is
a
situation
which,
if
it
would
be
likely
to
come
to
the
attention
of
the
youth
in
the
program,
it
would
be
open
to--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--scouts
to
terminate
that
person's
membership.
i
can't
cite
a
case
that
that's
happened.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
right.
he
was
then
and
there
the
copresident
of
rutger's
gay
and
lesbian
group.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
no,
no.
he
was
then
a
member
of
the
gay
alliance
at
the
time
he
was...
yes.
yes.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that's--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--right.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
it
would
be
open
to
scouts
to
make
that
determination,
and
it's
also
open
to
scouts
to--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--i
have
no
information
as
to
how
that
situation
would
be
resolved.
i
would
observe
that
it
would
be
open
to
the
scouts
to
conclude
that
somebody
who
is
himself
presenting
a
personal
example,
as
well
as
advocating,
might
be
more
unacceptable
than
somebody
who
was
merely
advocating.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--there
are
several
position
statements,
of
which
that's
the
first,
to
the
effect
that
scouting
does
not
appoint
avowedly
homosexual
leaders.
whether
the
word
avowedly
is
used
in
each
statement
or
not,
the
policy
is
not
to
ask,
so
it
only
comes
up
when
a
person
is
wearing
it
on
their
sleeve.
but
5
years
ago
we
came
to
this
court
in
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
the
hurley
case
to
catalogue
the
numerous
public
accommodations
cases
that
were
being
brought
around...
against
the
scouts
around
the
country,
and
the
case
we
bring
here
today
we
submit
is
a
stronger
case
than
hurley
in
several
respects.
in
hurley
there
was
no
readily
apparent
parade,
message
in
the
parade.
here,
we
have
a
moral
code,
which
has
been
recited
in
unison
at
virtually
every
meeting
by
all
the
adults
and
boys
in
the
program
since
1910,
in
which
they
promise
to
be
morally
straight
and
clean
in
thought,
word,
and
deed.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
let
me
answer
both
of
those
questions
in
order.
as
to
the
federal
charter,
virtually
everything
conducted
in
the
corporate
forum
is
necessarily
chartered
by
a
government
entity
and,
as
this
court
said
in
the
gay
olympic
games
case,
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics,
that
doesn't
deprive
a
corporation
of
its
private
character.
with
respect
to
government
sponsorship,
everybody
who
sponsors
a
scout
troop
signs
on
to
follow
scouting's
values
and
procedures.
if,
for
political
or
legal
reasons,
they
shouldn't
be
doing
that,
their
remedy
is
to
not
continue
to
support
scouting.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
with
respect
to
the...
we
have
governments
that
are
begging
scouting
to
go
into
cabrini
green
housing
projects,
and
to
have
cub
packs
at
women's
prisons,
but
scouting
itself
has
pulled
back
considerably
from
goverment,
taking
the
career
awareness
exploring
program
back
and
making
it
a
nonmembershp
activity
which
doesn't
involve
oaths
or
membership
or
anything
like
that,
so
that
many
police
and
fire
departments
are
no
longer
sponsoring
scouting
units,
because
that's
been
moved
over
to
learning
for
life.
but
i'm
not
sure
if
your
honor
was
based
on,
as
a
matter
of
new
jersey
law,
or
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
justice
kennedy,
that
may
well
be.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
justice
scalia,
kansas
has
held
that
a
school
is
not
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
but
there's
authority
in
other
states
the
other
way.
i
don't
know
of
any
new
jersey
authority.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
right.
the
scouts
have
said
many
times
that
their
policies
are
not
for
sale,
and
if
it
costs
the
sponsorship,
well
that's...
so
be
it.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
in
two
respects.
first,
if
nobody
knows
about
it,
it
doesn't
become
an
issue.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
if
it
becomes
known
to
the
scouts,
the
person
would
not
be
an
appropriate
role
model
and
presumably
would
not
be
permitted
to
continue.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
it's
known
or
avowed.
in
practice,
it
has
been
avowed,
and
rather
publicly
avowed.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
right.
the
right
is
that
of
scouting
to
choose
the
moral
leaders
it
wants
for
the
children
in
the
program.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
there's
some
reference
to
troop
260
in
one
of
the
affidavits
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
should
have
but
did
not
put
in
an
affidavit
in
response
to
that
from
grant
robinson,
the
scout
executive
in
the
area
where
that
troop
was
involved,
indicating
that
the
troop
did
agree
to
follow
the
policy
in...
so
as
to
be
rechartered.
that
robinson
affidavit
can
be
found
at
4760
of
the
record.
i
had--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
well,
i'm
not
sure
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law
that
one
might
decide
for
public
reaction
reasons
to
have
a
certain
policy.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
legal
relevance
of
that
distinction.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
but--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--there's
been
no
evidence
that
would
raise
any
question
of
fact
on
that
issue.
there's
been
no
question
that
the
statements,
the
position
statements
aren't
authentic
and
weren't
issued
by
who
they
said
they
were
issued
by.
there's
simply
no
basis
for
any
such
conclusion.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
justice
souter,
this
issue
came
up
in
one
case
in
1981,
the
curran
case.
it
never
came
up
again
for
10
years,
until
mr.
dale
sued
in
1992.
the...
there's
no
obligation
to
talk
about
every
single
application
of
the
morally
straight
policy
in
every
manual
to
enjoy
first
amendment
protection.
every
single
scout
leader
in
1992
read
about
this
in
a
magazine
article
sent
to
them
by
boy
scouts
of
america.
this
is
a
far
stronger
case
than
hurley
in
terms
of
the
message
that
scouting
is
sending,
as
compared
to
the
parade
leaders.
this
is
a
case--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--justice
souter,
he
put
a
banner
around
his
neck
when
he
put...
got
himself
into
the
newspaper
and
scout
leaders
throughout
monmouth
council
sent
the
article
in
to
headquarters.
he
created
a
reputation.
this
is
a
place
he
goes
once
a
week,
a
camping
trip
once
a
month,
summer
camp
for
a
week.
these
are
people
that
see
him
all
the
time.
he
can't
take
that
banner
off.
he
put
it
on
himself
and,
indeed,
he
has
continued
to
put
it
on
himself
in
this
week's
time
magazine,
the
out
100,
the
new
york
times--
mr.
george
a.
davidson
--well,
it's
as
if,
in...
the
glb
marchers
sought
to
put
on
the
uniform
of
the
south
boston
war
veterans
council.
it
requires
boy
scouting
to
identify
with
that
message
that
mr.
dale
has
created.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
bit
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
a.
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
we've
been
in
litigation
on
this
precise
issue
for
the
last
19
years
and
5
days,
and
i
would
just
say
this,
that
if
you
have
to
dissect
each
butterfly
in
order
to
classify
it,
there
are
not
going
to
be
many
butterflies
left.
thank
you.
