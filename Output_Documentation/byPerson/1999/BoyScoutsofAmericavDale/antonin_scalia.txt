when
you...
i'm
not
sure
what
we're
talking
about
when
we
say
exclusion
of
people
who
are
not
openly
homosexual.
i
mean,
what
if
someone
is
homosexual
in
the
sense
of
having
a
sexual
orientation
in
that
direction
but
does
not
engage
in
any
homosexual
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
openly
homosexual
in
the
sense
of
practicing
homosexuality?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
sexual
expression
of
it
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
places
of
public
accommodation?
i
don't
know.
i...
if
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--anyway,
your
point
is
if
government
giving
any
assistance
to
the
scouts
is
a
problem,
you'd
rather,
no
thank
you,
not
have
the
assistance
than
have
to
change
your
policies.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
ask,
mr.
davidson,
if
scouts
or
proposed
scout
leaders
are
adulterers?
is
that
one
of
the
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
ask
if
they're
ax
murderers?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
don't
want
them
to
be
that
you
don't
ask
about,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
people
certainly
haven't
liked
ex-cons
for
a
long
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
discrete
and
disadvantaged
minority,
or
hopefully
a
minority.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
exist
here?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
is
there
any
doubt
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
boy
scouts,
if
not
its
primary
purpose,
is
moral
formation,
the
scout's
oath,
and
all
that
good
stuff?
isn't
that
what
you
say...
he's
a
boy
scout,
as
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
moral
formation
is.
you
concede
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
say,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
have
any
power
to
question
it
if
the
leadership
of
the
organization
says
so,
that
one
of
the
elements
of
that
moral
formation
is
that
they
think
that
homosexuality
is
immoral.
now,
how
does
that
not
make
it
an
essential
part
of
scouting's
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
person
is
publicly
known
to
be
an
embodiment
of
the...
of
a
contradiction
of
its
moral
message,
how
can
that
not
dilute
the
message?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
our
law
requires
that
it
be
speech.
i
think
our
law
simply
prevents
the
state
from
diluting
or
imperiling
the
message
that
an
organizaiton
wants
to
convey,
whether
the
state
does
it
by
speech,
or
whether
the
state
does
it
by
dropping
a
bomb.
it
seems
to
me
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
this
is
the
basis
on
which
you
prevail,
what
you
will
have
succeeded
in
doing
is
inducing
the
boy
scouts
of
america
to
be
more
openly
and
avowedly
opposed
to
homosexual
conduct
in
all
of
its
publications.
is
that
what
this
case
is
all
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
being
an
antigay
organization
and
having
a
policy
of
disapproving
of
homosexual
conduct.
you
don't
have
to
have
as
your
raison
d'etre
to
oppose
homosexuality
in
order
to
believe
that
it
is
part
of
your
moral
code
that
that
conduct
is
inappropriate,
and
that's
the
position
that
the
boy
scouts
have
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
insist
that
they
go
further
and
make
that
a
prominent
part
of
their
promotion.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sponsoring
group
is
not
the
group
that
conducts
the
scouting
activities.
