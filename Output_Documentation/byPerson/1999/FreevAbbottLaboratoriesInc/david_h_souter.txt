okay,
but
i
take
it
there
is
no
hint
anywhere
of
an
intent
to
overrule
strawbridge,
and
i
take
it
that
your
position
there
has
to
be,
no,
there
wasn't
any
intent
to
overrule
it,
but
that's
what
the
plain
language
does,
and
congress
can
fix
it
up
when
it
comes
back
next
time
if
that's
the
case.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
didn't...
i
wasn't
sure
what
your
position
was
in
your
brief--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that's
the
position
you're
taking
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
almost
certainly
must
be.
i
mean,
the...
it's
inconceivable
that
they
meant
to
go
that
far.
but
i
think
you're
taking
the
position
here
that
you
will
be
consistent,
strawbridge
goes,
and
congress
undoubtedly
will
come
back
and
mend
that
in
january
or
whenever.
