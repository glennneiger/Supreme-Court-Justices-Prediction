justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
argument
under
1367.
in
clause
(b)
it
begins,
in
any
civil
action
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
founded
solely
on
section
1332
of
this
title,
you
say
read
no
further.
that
clause
has
not
been
satisfied
in
this
case.
whatever
follows
is
just
irrelevant.
is
that...
or,
i
don't
wish
to
misstate
your
argument.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it...
the
statute
begins
by
saying,
except
as
provided
in
subsections
(b)
and
(c),
so
it
seems
to
me
that
to
make
your
argument
you
have
to
go
to
(b)
and
then
say
that
the
first
clause
takes
you
out
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
1367
give
jurisdiction
to
a
finley-type
plaintiff
where
the
finley
court
had
not
given
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
1367
does
confer
jurisdiction
on
some
plaintiffs
at
least,
at
least
the
finley
plaintiffs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
finley-type
plaintiffs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
if
it
restored.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
court
had
said
that
there
was
no
such
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
if
it
does
so
as
to
the
finley
plaintiffs,
why
not
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
read
the
statute
as
i'm
suggesting
you
have
to
read
it
in
order
to
get
to
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
way
you
read
the
statute
is
that
congress
told
the
supreme
court,
when
you
get
another
finley
case,
would
you
think
about
it
again?
that's...
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
you're
saying
the
statute
does.
it's
a
very
odd
statute.
