justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
you
suggest
that
this
statute
changed
the
lower
court's
general
reading
of
ben
hur?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
are
you
making
the
argument,
basically,
that
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
or
are
you
making
the
same
argument...
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
plaintiffs',
the
original
plaintiffs',
class
representatives'
claim
didn't
depend
on
attorney's
fees,
but
that
one
individual
had
a
60,000
dollars
or
70,000
dollar
claim.
then
would
you
say
there
was
no
original
jurisdiction
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
counsel?
let
me
just
assume
something
for
a
moment.
assume
that
i
think
you've
by
far
got
the
better
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
assume
that
it's
also
perfectly
clear,
and
maybe
it
isn't
perfectly
clear,
but
it's
really
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that,
that
they
did
not
intend
to
expand...
make
a
rather
dramatic
expansion
in
federal
jurisdiction
after
this
task
force
study
said
that
diversity's
a
big
problem
for
the
federal
courts.
assuming
those
two
things,
you...
the
better
reading,
but
the
legislative
history
is
crystal
clear
to
the
contrary.
what
should
we
do?
