chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-391,
robin
free
v.
abbott
laboratories.
mr.
small.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
a
matter
of
louisiana
law,
is
it
not,
at
least
so
the
fifth
circuit
held,
that
the
named
plaintiffs
get
all
of
the
attorney's
fees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
address
yourself
to
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
it
could
not
be
clearer,
i
take
it
you're
talking
about
the
legislative
history
and
not
the
statute
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
we
usually
first
look
to
find
out
what
congress
intended,
at
the
words
that
congress
wrote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
view
of
that
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
go
back
for
a
minute
to
1367,
and
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
against
you
on
this
point,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
your
response
to
the
fifth
circuit's
construction
of
1367?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
just
rules
out
supplemental
jurisdiction
altogether.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
one
can
read
it
as
making
a
change
in
the
law,
as
overruling
zahn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know?
if
what
congress
wrote
overrules
zahn,
why
do
you
get
to
anything
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
congress
pass
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
finley--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
gave--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
small.
mr.
cicero,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
we
generally
defer
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
questions
of
state
law.
in
other
words,
if
the
fifth
circuit
says,
under
louisiana
law
we
think
this
was
a...
would
be
likely
to
happen,
we
don't
generally
second-guess
the
fifth
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
address
yourself
now
to
the
question
presented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cicero.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
small,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
small.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
99-391,
free
versus
abbott
laboratories
inc.
the
judgment
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
justice
oâ€™connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
