mr.
daniel
a.
small
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1367
plainly
requires
original
jurisdiction
as
a
predicate
to
the
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
supplemental
jurisdiction
may
not
be
exercised
over
the
claims
of
the
absent
class
members
because
the
claims
of
the
named
plaintiffs
are
not
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
the
critical
issue
in
this
case,
therefore,
involves
an
issue
of
original
jurisdiction
and
involves
an
interpretation,
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement
of
the
diversity
statute.
specifically,
the
issue
is
whether
the
determination
under
that
requirement
that
a
particular
plaintiff
satisfies
that
requirement
looks
only
to
the
value
of
that
plaintiff's
claims,
or
does
it
also
look
to
the
value
of
his
coplaintiff's
claims.
the
answer
is,
the
matter-in-controversy
rule
is
an
all-or-nothing
rule.
either
all
plaintiffs
in
the
case
satisfy
it,
or
none
do.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it
is
true,
your
honor,
that
none
of
the
plaintiffs
have
damages
that
would
satisfy
the
then-applicable
50,000
dollars
matter-in-controversy
requirement.
the
only
reason
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
the
named
plaintiff
satisfied
that
requirement
was
a
louisiana
fee
statute
that
awarded
fees
in
a
class
action
solely
to
the
class
representative.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that
is
precisely
correct.
the
applicability
of
that
louisiana
fee
statute
applies
only
in
a
class
action.
if
there's
no
jurisdiction
to
bring
a
class
action,
that
statute
would
not
apply
and
the
named
plaintiffs,
the
frees,
would
not
have
the
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
well,
your
honor,
we
didn't
specifically
raise
it
because
we
didn't
frame
the
question
presented
in
that
way.
we
were
addressing
it
as
an
issue
of
whether
the
zahn
ruling
of
this
court
should
be
overturned.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
attempted
in
the
fifth
circuit,
in
the
second
appeal
before
that
court,
to
raise
certain
issues
of
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
which
the
fifth
circuit
refused
to
hear
on
the
ground
of
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine,
and
there
are
other
issues,
of
course,
which
we
do
not
agree
with
that
the
fifth
circuit
decided,
but
we
are
not
squarely
presenting
those
to
this
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
i
think,
your
honor,
that
goes
to
the
appropriate
result
in
this
case
if
the
court
were
to
reverse,
because
it
would
require
that
everyone's
claims
go
back
to
state
court,
because
the
absent
class
members
as
well
as
the
named
plaintiffs
would
not
have
the
amount--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--that
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law.
there
was
a
specific--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--they
would
not
get
attorney's
fees
under
the
specific
louisiana
statute.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
our
view
of
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement
is
a
permissible
interpretation
under
section
1332,
the
diversity
statute,
and
it's
also
the
better
reading
of
that
statute
for
several
reasons.
first,
let
me
summarize
quickly
what
the
reasons
are
that
our
interpretation
of
1332,
which
fits
within
the
language,
is
the
better
interpretation.
first,
it
avoids
having
section
1367
operate
in
a
way
that
congress
clearly
did
not
intend.
it
could
not
be
clearer
that
congress
did
not
intend,
when
it
enacted
1367,
to
sweep
aside
a
fundamental,
longstanding
rule
of
limiting
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
we're
talking
about
more
than
just
the
legislative
history,
your
honor.
we're
talking
first
about
the
context
in
which
the
statute
became
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
yes,
and
looking
at--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--my
view
of
that
language,
your
honor,
is
that
section
1367's
plain
language
has
relevance
to
only
one
issue
in
this
case.
the
plain
language
tells
this
court
that
before
supplemental
jurisdiction
can
be
exercised
in
this
case,
original
jurisdiction
has
to
exist,
and
so
it
refers
the
court
from
1367
to
the
original
jurisdiction
statute,
which
in
this
case
is
1332.
that
is
the
end
of
the
role
of
1367
in
this
case.
now
we're
into
1332,
and
there,
we
don't
have
plain
language.
we're
saying
that
the
term,
matter-in-controversy,
in
section
1332,
is
subject
to
different
interpretations.
our
interpretation
is
certainly
permissible,
it
fits
within
the
language,
and
our
interpretation
is
the
preferred
one
for
several
reasons,
the
first
of
which
i
indicated
was
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
overrule
zahn.
and
congress'
intent
can
be
effectuated
in
1367
only
if
1332
is
interpreted
in
the
way
we
suggest,
and
that
task
is
called
a
classic
judicial
task
that
this
court
recognized
just
last
week
in
fda
v.
brown
&
williamson,
to
take
multiple
laws
that
have
been
passed
over
time
and
make
them
work
in
combination.
we
are
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
read
section
1332
permissibly,
within
its
language,
in
a
way
that
allows
1367
to
function
coherently
and
in
a
way
that
congress
intended
when
it
enacted--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
the
fifth
circuit
overlooked,
in
our
opinion,
the
original
jurisdiction
predicate
in
1367.
it
assumed
that
it
has
original
jurisdiction
over
the
named
plaintiffs'
claims
when
in
fact
they
did
not,
because
the
matter-in-controversy
rule
says
you
cannot
have
original
jurisdiction
over
one
plaintiff's
claims
without
considering
the
value
of
all
his
coplaintiffs',
or
her
coplaintiffs'
claims,
and
if
you
look
at
all
the--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct,
and
obviously
there's
the
parallel
between
the
other
provision
of--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--in
the
class
action
context,
as
this
court's
decision
in
ben
hur
has
subsequently
been
construed
by
lower
courts,
it
is
true
that
you
look
at
the
named
plaintiffs
to
see
whether
they
are
diverse
from
each
of
the
defendants.
first
of
all,
the
rule
still
applies
to
all
the
named
plaintiffs.
if
there's
more
than
one,
each
of
the
named
plaintiffs
have
to
be
diverse
from
each
of
the
named
defendants.
moreover,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
ben
hur
has
been
the
anomalous
decision
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
diversity
statute.
in
every
other
way
that
this
court
has
construed
the
diversity
statute,
both
for
class
actions
and
nonclass
actions,
they
have
interpreted
the
statute
narrowly.
it's
not
a
reason
to
now
start
interpreting
other
aspects
of
1332
broadly
for--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--i
agree
with
you
in
part,
your
honor.
the
part
that
i
disagree
with
is,
ben
hur,
which
is
the
only
supreme
court
decision
that's
ever
relied
on
for
that
proposition,
was
essentially
an
in
rem
case,
meaning
that
there
were
trust
assets
before
the
court
that
had
to
be
disposed
of
and
could
only
be
disposed
of--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--i'm
not
disputing
that,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
that's
a
lower
court
interpretation
that
has
expanded
ben
hur.
that's
all
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
our
interpretation
would
affect
ben
hur.
in
fact,
the
house
judiciary
committee
report
cites
the
ben
hur
right
alongside
zahn
in
saying
that
those
were
jurisdictional
requirements
that
were
not
intended
to
be
affected
by
1367.
i
think
the
basic
purpose
of
1367,
which
is
also
made
very
clear,
is
to
codify
existing
supplemental
jurisdiction
as
it
existed
before
finley.
the
concern
of
congress
in
enacting
1367
was
the
finley
case,
which
had
called
into
question
whether
the
statutory
authority
was
there
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
all
types
of
cases.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
not
quite,
justice
kennedy.
what
we're
saying
is,
we
never
get
to
1367(b)
in
this
case.
this
case
is
all
about
1367(a)
and
section
1332.
1367(a)
is
the
part
of
the
statute
that
confers
supplemental
jurisdiction,
okay,
and
before
the
statute
can
confer
any
supplemental
jurisdiction,
there
must
be
original
jurisdiction.
there
is
none
in
this
case,
therefore
none
is
conferred
under
(a).
we
never
get
to
(b).
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
there
would
be
coplaintiffs
in
the
case,
here
absent
class
members,
who
do
not
have
the
jurisdictional
amount.
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement
says,
it's
not
enough
just
to
look
at
one
plaintiff's
claim
to
see
whether
that
satisfies
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement.
you
have
to
look
at
everyone's,
and
if
anyone's
in
the
case,
any
plaintiff
who
doesn't
satisfy
the
amount-in-controversy,
no
plaintiff--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--well,
your
honor,
it
never
existed
before
1367
as
to
claims
by
plaintiffs
joined
under
rule
20
or
rule
23,
so
it's
not
a
change
in
the
law.
it
codifies
the
way
the
law
was
before.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
well,
that
is,
of
course,
what
the
question
is
here--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--your
honor,
and
our
point
is
that
that's
not
an
appropriate
reading
because,
number
1,
we
know
congress
didn't
want
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
well,
we
know
that
what
congress
wrote
in
1367
does
not
overrule
zahn
because
all
that
1367
says
is,
you
can
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
if
there's
first
original
jurisdiction.
there's
no
original
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
if
our
position
were
that
1367(a)
granted
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
absent
class
members,
we
would
have
to
get
to
(b)
to
say,
but
it
took
it
away.
that's
not
our
position.
our
position
is
it
was
never
granted
in
the
first
place.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
well--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it
has
to
do,
your
honor,
with
the
scope
of
the
matter-in-controversy
rule.
there
are
parties
over
which
supplemental
jurisdiction
can
be
exercised
in
a
diversity
case.
for
example,
defendants'
claims
can
be
the
subject
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
for
instance,
if
a
defendant
impleads
a
third
party,
that
claim
can
be
within
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
a
diversity
case.
all
the
statute
is
doing
is
for--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--but
that's
not
the
way
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement
has
been
interpreted
in
decisions--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--i
believe
there
are
reasons
that
have
been
expressed
by
the
court
in
deciding
whether
the
addition
of
certain
claims
into
a
diversity
case
are
treated
as
a
matter
of
original
jurisdiction
or
as
a
matter
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
in
the
kroger
case,
for
instance,
your
honor,
the
question
of
whether
the
impleaded
third
party
defendant
was
in
the
case
as
a
matter
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
was
easily
disposed
of
because
it
was
viewed
as
being
different
from
a
plaintiff
being
brought
in,
because
the
defendant
is
hailed
into
court
against
its
will
and
shouldn't
be
put
to
the
bother
of
having
to
go
into
a
separate
state
court
action
to
bring
a
counterclaim,
or
a
third
party
claim,
or
whatever.
so
there
is
a
justification
the
court
has
offered
for
saying
what
the
scope
of
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement
is.
there
are
reasons
it
doesn't
apply
to
claims
by
defendants
and
it
used
to
be,
before
1367,
that
certain
plaintiffs'
claims
could
come
in,
for
instance
under
rule
24,
if
they
were
intervening
as
a
matter
of
necessity
to
protect
their
rights
in
the
litigation.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
1367
did
not
expand
supplemental
jurisdiction
at
all.
there
are
no
parties
that
could
enter
under
1367
that
could
not
before.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
congress
passed
1367
because
of
the
finley
decision.
congress
was
concerned
that
the
finley
decision
raised
great
doubt
about
whether
there
was
statutory
authority
for
supplemental
jurisdiction.
the
finley
decision
said
that
unless
the
original
jurisdiction
statute,
in
that
case
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
showed
that
there
was
supplemental
jurisdiction,
it
could
not
be
exercised
and
that
in
that
context,
when
parties
were
being
added
to
the
case,
the
original
jurisdiction
statute
would
be
narrowly
construed.
so
congress
was
very
concerned
that
the
foundation
for
pendant
party
jurisdiction
was
undercut
by
finley,
and
possibly
even
pendant
claim
jurisdiction,
so
that
was
the
reason.
now,
remember
that
1367
was
passed
as
part
of
a
large
bill
that
dealt
with
all
sorts
of
noncontroversial
matters
that
congress
believed
could
be
readily
dealt
with
late
in
the
session,
and
no
one
thought
this
was
controversial.
this
was
just
a
way
to
codify
existing
law
so
that
finley
was
no
longer
a
problem.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
finley
said
there
may...
there
cannot
be
an
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
a
pendant
party
case
unless
there's
statutory
authority
for
that
exercise,
and
congress
wanted
to
provide
the
missing
statutory
authority
that
the
finley
court
pointed
out.
1367
is
that
missing
authority.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that
was
the
particular
problem
in
finley
but,
of
course,
there
was
concern
that
finley
could
be
read
broader
and,
in
fact,
had
been
by
some
of
the
lower
courts
to
justify
denials
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
other
areas.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it
restored--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--the
answer
is
yes.
it
restored
supplemental
jurisdiction
to
the
way
it
was
before
finley
was
enacted.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it's
true
at
the...
it
did
change
the
law
from
the
way
it
existed
after
the
finley
case
was
decided.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
well,
finley--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--there
is,
of
course,
a
completely
different
history
behind
diversity
jurisdiction
compared
to
pendant
party
jurisdiction.
remember,
in
pendant
party
jurisdiction
there
has
to
be
a
claim
in
the
court
that's
a
federal
claim,
and
this
court
and
congress
has
treated
cases
that
include
federal
claims
very
differently
from
cases
that
include
only
state
law
claims.
if
there's
a
federal
claim,
then
the
plaintiff
can
be
put
to
the
problem
of
either
having
to
split
its
case
between
federal
court
for
the
federal
claim
and
state
court
for
the
state
claim,
or
else
has
to
put
all
its
claims
into
state
court,
including
the
federal
claim.
in
the
diversity
context,
that's
not
the
situation.
all
the
claims
can
be
in
state
court
without
having
any
federal
claims
decided
by
a
state
court,
so
that
is
part
of
the
rationale
for
treating
diversity
jurisdiction
differently,
but
despite
any
particular
rationale,
there
has
certainly
been
a
clear
policy
by
congress
to
steadily
narrow
diversity
jurisdiction,
supplemental--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--we
don't
believe
that
that's
what
congress
was
doing.
i
think
congress
was
trying
to
codify
ancillary
and
pendant
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it
would
do
precisely
that,
justice
scalia.
it
would
provide
the
statutory
authority
that
the
finely
court
noted
was
missing.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
that's
correct.
the...
finley
was
the
immediate
impetus
of
congress
enacting
1367.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it
would
certainly
make
sense
to
do
it
in
1332,
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
the
inconsistency
under
the
respondents'
interpretation
is
that
you
can
have
a
plaintiff
come
into
a
diversity
case
under
rule
20
in
their
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
that
plaintiff,
but
the
very
same
plaintiff
could
not
enter
the
case
under
rule
19
when
it
was
necessary,
for
instance,
to
avoid
the
potential
for
multiple
liability
or
inconsistent
obligations
on
the
part
of
a
defendant,
and
would
also
prohibit
that
very
same
plaintiff
from
coming
in
to
the
case
as
an
intervenor
under
rule
24
to
protect
his
or
her
interests
in
the
litigation.
it
simply
cannot
make
sense
for
that
distinction
between
rules
19
and
24
on
the
one
hand
and
rule
20
on
the
other,
and
that's
precisely
what
judge
easterbrook
asked
in
the
stromberg
case.
he
said,
what
sense
can
this
make,
and
the
answer
is,
none,
and
congress...
that
is
a
reason
to
interpret
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement
of
section
1332
in
a
way
that
will
cause
1367
to
operate
coherently.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
there
was
no
need,
your
honor,
to
include
rule
23
in
1367(b)
because
there's
no
original
jurisdiction
over
class
members
who
lack
the
jurisdictional
amount,
therefore
there's
no
supplemental
jurisdiction
conferred
over
their
claims
by
1367(a),
and
therefore
no
need
to
exclude
that
jurisdiction
in
1367(b).
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
think
there's
any
distinction
under
respondents'
argument
between
what
would
happen
to
zahn
and
what
would
happen
to
strawbridge
v.
curtiss.
both
cases
would
have
to
go
under
their
interpretation.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
1367(b)
prohibits
claims
by
plaintiffs
against
certain
parties
added
to
the
action
by
defendants.
that
was
precisely
the
situation
in
kroger.
kroger
analyzed
that
as
a
matter
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
that
claim,
potential
claim
by
the
plaintiff
against
the
impleaded
third
party
defendant
was
an
issue
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
that
would
not
be
affected
by
the
original
jurisdiction
predicate
of
1367(a).
therefore,
it's
necessary
to
exclude
under
(b)
the
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
that
situation,
otherwise
there
would
be
an
expansion
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
pre-finley
that
congress
did
not
intend.
the...
and
also
pre-finley
plaintiffs
could
enter
a
case
as
intervenors
as
of
right
under
rule
24.
those
claims
were
evaluated
as
a
matter
of
supplemental
jurisdiction,
not
as
original
jurisdiction.
there
would...
so
there
would
be
jurisdiction
over
those
claims
conferred
by
1367(a).
they
need
to
be
taken
away
in
(b).
now,
the
key
issue
in
this
case
is
not
an
interpretation
of
1367.
it's
an
interpretation
of
1332,
because
there's
no
argument
here
that
if
we're
right
about
the
interpretation
of
1332,
1367
does
not
overrule
zahn.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
i'm
sorry?
mr.
daniel
a.
small
in
finley
there
was
not.
mr.
daniel
a.
small
it
would,
your
honor,
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act
works
differently
from
the
diversity
statute.
it
has
not
been
interpreted,
as
has
the
diversity
statute,
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states
defeated
if
some
party
comes
in
under
supplemental
jurisdiction,
but
that
is
how
the
diversity
statute
works.
now,
there
are
three
results
that
will
occur
from
respondents'
interpretation
that
they
seriously
don't
dispute.
you'll
have
incoherence
in
1367,
you
will
have
1367
operating
contrary
to
clear
legislative
intent,
and
you'll
have
a
broadening
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
diversity
cases.
those
are
reasons
to
narrowly
construe
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement,
particularly
when
this
court
has
gone
out
of
its
way--
mr.
daniel
a.
small
--thank
you.
