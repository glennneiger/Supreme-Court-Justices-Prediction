justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
now,
maybe
i'm
back
to
where
i
think
the
chief
justice
was.
where
do
you
think
this
statute
(a)...
where
does
it
operate?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
saying...
you're
saying...
all
right,
we
have
a
person
called
smith.
smith's
the
lead
plaintiff.
he
qualifies
as
original
jurisdiction
as
to
him,
okay.
we
assume
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
we're
going
to
look
to
other
members
of
the
class,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
you're
saying
unless
there's
original
jurisdiction
also
as
to
b,
also
as
to
c,
also
as
to
d,
that
the
whole
statute
doesn't
operate.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
that's
true,
then
why
isn't
that
also
true...
take
the
person
that
they're
aiming
at
in
this
statute,
somebody
who
comes
along
and
has
some
kind
of
supplemental
claim
later
on,
or
a
defendant
or
somebody
who's
not
in
the
suit.
there's
somebody
you
can
add,
and
there's
somebody
that
this
was
needed
to
get
into
court,
and
why
wouldn't
exactly
your
same
argument
then
apply
to
that
person?
you'd
say,
well,
there
was
never
original
jurisdiction
over
that
person,
which
of
course
there
wasn't.
that's
why
they
wrote
this
statute.
so
if
we
accept
that
argument
of
yours
as
to
class
people,
why
wouldn't
we
have
to
accept
it
as
to
everybody
and
then
this
1367(a)
would
do
nothing
whatsoever?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
just
tell
me
why?
on
your
theory,
that
person
that
they
just
brought
in
wouldn't
have
had
an
original...
you
wouldn't
have
had
original
jurisdiction
over
that
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
you
want
to
just
limit
your
word,
original
jurisdiction,
to
where
what
happens
to
be
the
disqualifying
feature
has
to
do
with
the
amount
in
controversy,
and
i'm
asking
you,
fine,
that's
nice,
i
agree
that
would
let
you
limit
the
case
and
win,
but
why
do
it
that...
why
that
limitation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
you're...
you're
way
ahead
of
me
because
you're
an
expert
on
this
and
i'm
not,
so
what...
give
me
an
example
of
somebody
who,
on
your
interpretation,
1367
would
enable
you
to
bring
into
the
case,
but
without
1367
it
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
on
that
theory,
congress
did
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
the
argument
they
made,
which
i
take
it
was
that
this
statute's
just
interested
in
changing
the
result
in
finley?
i
under...
as
i
understood
it,
and
justice
scalia
could...
he
wrote
it,
so...
i
understood
that
finley
was
a
federal
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claim
act.
a
sues
b,
and
everybody
concedes
that
a
could
assert
some
state
claims
against
b,
but
the
question
was,
could
they
bring
in
c
to
assert
the...
a
wants
to
sue
c
on
those
state
claims,
which
are
related
to
the
claim
against
b,
and
it's
a
case
in
which
there
would
independently
have
been
diversity
jurisdiction,
a
versus
c,
and
so
all
that
this
statute's
trying
to
do
is
to
change
that
result,
and
whereas
the
court
was
worried
about
whether
congress
had
permitted
it,
they
said
yes,
congress
permits
it.
that's
what
this
is
about.
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you're
absolutely
right,
in
my
opinion,
that
literally
the
language
would
cover
an
over...
overturning
zahn
too,
but
then
it
would
also
cover,
literally,
permissive
joinder
under
rule
20.
i
take
it
then
you
could
bring
in
all
the
plaintiffs
you
want,
join
them
too,
and
you
don't
like
that
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
you're
saying
they
didn't
intend
to
do
that,
because
that's
the
end
of
strawberry,
or
that's
the
end
of
complete
diversity.
what
i
do
is,
i
happen
to
be
from
massachusetts,
i
sue
somebody
from
rhode
island,
and
now,
by
the
way,
i
have
40,000
friends
who
have
the
same
claim,
all
from
rhode
island,
too,
so
i
bring
them
all
in
under
rule
20.
now,
that
would
be
quite
a
change
in
federal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
apply
to
my
case,
i
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
so
if
you...
you're
either
saying...
so
that
you
are
now
going
to
say
that
indeed,
since
you
want
a
literal
interpretation
of
this
language,
you're
saying
that
not
only
did
this
statute
overturn
zahn,
it
also
turned...
overturned
what
i
call
is
the
pillar
of
this
obscure
area
of
the
law,
namely
strawberry,
or...
is
that
the
case?
you
know,
that
you
have
to
have
complete--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
so
it's
going
back,
and
it's
abolishing
the
complete
diversity
rule,
and
they
never
said
a...
that's
pretty
hard
to
take,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
a
pretty
big
change.
nobody
ever
noticed
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it's
not...
it
doesn't...
look,
this
is
exactly
the
point
that's
worrying
me,
that
i
seem
to
have
only
two
choices.
the
word
is
all
claims,
and
if
you
take
those
words,
all
claims,
we
have
two
choices,
apply
it,
or
don't,
and
certainly
the
word,
all,
in
the
law
is
a
word
that
often
doesn't
mean
all.
exceptions
are
often
written
in.
so
what
you're
telling
me,
don't
write
an
exception,
read
all
to
mean
all,
but
if
i
do
that,
imagine
a
bus
accident
in
the
center
of
texas,
50
people
killed,
every
one
of
them
from
texas
but
one,
all
defendants
from
texas.
that
one
person
is
from
oklahoma,
and
because
one
of
the
50
are
from
oklahoma,
we
now
have
a
federal
court
suit
in
which
all
50
sue
the
texas
defendants.
is
that
right?
that...
if
i
say
all...
i
either
say
all
means
all,
or
i
don't,
and
once
you're
down
the
line
of
saying,
read
in
some
exceptions,
this
is
a
good
candidate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
original
jurisdiction
over
c
in
finley?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
original
jurisdiction
over
the...
that
person,
the
municipality
in
finley?
you
know,
the
one
that...
the
one
the
plaintiff
wanted
to
bring
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
not.
so
therefore,
finley...
on
this
you
wouldn't
say...
wouldn't
change
the
result
in
finley.
