justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
small,
you
didn't
raise
the
question
whether
any
plaintiff
in
this
class
qualifies.
that
is,
i
take
it
that
the
frees
in
their
own
right,
if
they
were
suing
for
their
own
individual
injury,
would
not
get
anywhere
near
50,000
dollars,
because
they're
like
all
the
others
in
that
respect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
their
ability
to
collect
those
fees
depends
on
their
bringing
other
people
with
them,
that
is,
the
solo
plaintiffs
who
don't
qualify
for
federal
court
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand,
you
did
bring
that
up
below,
but
you
didn't
tender
it
to
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
if
it
goes
to
the
amount
in
controversy,
or
diversity
jurisdiction,
it
is
jurisdictional
and,
even
if
you
didn't
bring
it
up,
you
know
that
we
would
have
an
obligation
to
do
so
on
our
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
want
to
detain
you,
because
you
want
to
argue
zahn
and
the
effect
of
1367,
but
i
do
see
that
as
a
major
problem
in
this
lawsuit,
that
these
plaintiffs
could
qualify
only
because
they
bring
other
plaintiffs
with
them,
and
not
in
their
individual
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
as
individuals.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
just
bringing
this
claim
for
the
baby
formula
in
their
own
right,
they
do
not
get
attorney's
fees
for
that,
do
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
louisiana
permits
them,
as
class
representatives,
to
get
these
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
get
them,
they
must
pull
other
people
along
with
them,
and
that
was
the
only
point
that
i
was
attempting
to
make.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
a
minute,
mr.
small.
it
isn't
correct,
is
it,
for
class
members?
in
diversity,
i
thought
that
for
diversity
purposes
the
named
plaintiffs
must
qualify,
but
the
ones
who
tag
along
do
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
just
trying
to
clarify
that
the
strawbridge
rule
of
complete
diversity
doesn't
apply
in
class
actions
to
the
extent
that
only
the
citizenship
of
named
representatives
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
today,
in
all
the
class
actions
that
are
brought
in
federal
court,
that
rule
isn't
observed,
that
only
the
named
representatives
count
for
diversity
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
but
finley
was
a
supreme
court
decision,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
did
finley
do
that
1367
changed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
then
at
least
it
provided
for
pendant
party
jurisdiction,
which
this
court
said
didn't
exist
before
absent
explicit
statutory
authorization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
do
you...
how
do
you
explain
the
absence
of
rule
23
in
1367(b),
which
enumerates
several
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
at
that
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
someone
who
has
an
individual
claim
of
this
nature,
even
treble,
that
is,
for
being
overcharged
for
baby
formula,
would
get
attorney's
fees
so
large
that
they
could
make
the
amount
in
controversy?
that
is,
what
are
these
individual
claims
worth?
it
would
be
for
how
much
extra
i
had
to
pay
for
the
formula
that
i
wouldn't
have
to
pay
if
they
hadn't
had
a
price-fixing
arrangement,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
has
to
be...
the
court
would
have
to
decide--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
case
were
brought
originally
in
federal
court
whether
what
you're
claiming
is
a
reasonable
assertion
of
amount-in-controversy,
and
if
i'm
right
that
these
claims
are
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
something
like
100
dollars
apiece,
even
trebled
would
be
a
300
dollar
claim,
how
could
you
expect
a
court
to
award
on
a
claim
of
that
size
such
an
astronomical
fee
that
would
get
you
up
to
50,000
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
examples
in
louisiana
of
a
small
claim
getting
under
the
provision
on
which
you
rely,
51:
137,
a
small
claim
attracting
large
legal
fees
under
louisiana
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
that
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
right
about
that.
do
you
remember
how
much
the
fee
was?
that
was
an
individual
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
1933
decision,
and
the
fee...
the
court...
it
was
a
250
dollar
attorney's
fees,
then
upped
to
550
dollars,
and
in
response,
in
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
before,
i
do
not
see
in
judge
higginbotham's
opinion
anything
that
says
that
under
louisiana
law
that
second
statute
would
justify
a
fee
of
this
size.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
there
is
something
that
i
missed
in
the
opinion,
point
it
out
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
suggesting
that
there
aren't
awards
of
that
size
made
when
you're
not
representing
a
class
where
the
recovery
will...
aggregated,
the
recovery
will
be
very
large.
that's
why
lawyers
represent
class...
classes
and
not
individual
plaintiffs
when
they
have
claims
of
this
nature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
snyder
said
you
couldn't
aggregate.
i
don't
understand
how...
i
would
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--snyder
supports
his
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
over
the
class
action.
they
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
case
brought
by
the
qualifying
plaintiffs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
let
me...
since
you
brought
that
up,
what
about
this
very
case?
suppose
the
zahn
rule
were
upheld.
could
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
stay
in
federal
court
when
all
they
have
is
their
claim
for
less
than
20,000
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
basis
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
court
decided
that
on
those
individual
claims
there
could
be
a
fee
of
that
size
justified,
and
you
have
not
been
able
to
tell
me,
at
least
this
morning,
that
there's
any
small
claim
in
louisiana
in
which
a
court
ever
awarded
a
fee
of
that
size.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr
cicero,
i...
i'm
just
going
back
to
your
prior
answer,
because
you're...
and
under
your
prior
answer,
every
one
of
these
class
members
could
stay
in
state
court.
you
told
me
in
response
to
the
question
that
the
named
representatives
could
stay
in
federal
court
because
they
could
get
this
fee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
named
representatives
are
just
like
every
other
member
of
the
class
as
far
as
the
stake
that
they
have,
the
claim
that
they
have,
so
all
you
would
have
to
do
is
add
a
whole
slew
of
other
names.
you
could
have
a
class
action
with
100,
200
named
representatives,
and
then
they
could
all
stay
in
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
only
if
you
read
the
statute
as
allowing
them
to
bring
along
the
others
to
test
whether
they
have
the
amount,
or
you
take...
forget
about
595.
you
just
concentrate
on
the
other
statute
and
say
what
you
haven't
been
able
to
document
this
morning,
that
on
a
small
claim
you
could
hope
to
get
such
a
sizeable
fee.
but
let's
leave
that
and
go
over
to
whether
1367
overruled
zahn,
which
is
the
question
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
strawbridge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cicero,
you
said...
you
said
that
everybody
agrees
on
that.
if
i
understand
right,
the
tenth
circuit
doesn't
agree.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
everybody...
the
tenth
circuit
in
fact
found
1367
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
can't
say...
now,
there
were
certainly
a
lot
of
academic
commentators
about
the
time
of
zahn
that
said
zahn
was
wrongly
decided,
because
it
should
have
been
like
ben
hur,
that
only
the
named
representatives'
amount-in-controversy
mattered,
not
the
class
members,
but
that
debate
was
in
the
1970's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
zahn
has
existed
since
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you
take
mr.
small's
interpretation
you
never
get
to
(b),
because
(a)...
because
you're
not...
you
can't
have
a
zahn-type
claim
under
(a).
his
position
was
that
if
congress
wanted
to
make
the
change,
it
would
have
to
make
it
in
1332.
that
was
the
place
for
it.
but
there
were
studies
that
led
up
to
1367.
there
was...
wasn't
there
the
federal
court
study
committee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
everybody
was
concerned
about
finley,
and
wasn't
that
the
motive,
motivating
force--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
1367?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
different
from
what,
by
the
way...
his
interpretation
different
from
the
tenth
circuit's
interpretation
of
1367?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cicero,
practically,
if
you
have
two
people
who
present
themselves
as
champions
of
a
class,
will
they
want
to
stay
in
federal
court
as
individual
claimants
and
not
continue
to
be
champions
of
the
class?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
very
purpose
of
their
bringing
the
class
action,
the
lawyer
representing
them,
is
that
they're
going
to
have
these
thousands
of
people
and
not
two
plaintiffs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
moved
to
remand
because
they
wanted
to
be
with
the
class,
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
cicero,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that,
sub
silentio,
congress
overruled
zahn
because
the
words
literally
read
do
that,
to
a
1973
case.
strawbridge
is
how
old?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
thought
that
that
mainstay
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction,
that
1806
case,
was
overruled
by
1367
i
think
is
an
awful
lot
to
take
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
you
say,
not
in
its
entirety,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you're
talking
about
initial
joinder
of
plaintiffs,
that's
the
heart
of
strawbridge
and
of
the
complete
diversity
rule,
and
it
just...
to
think
of
what
that
would
throw
into
federal
courts
if
you
were
to
have...
if
you
were
to
say
that
1367,
with
a
few
exceptions,
has
enacted
minimal
diversity,
that's
a
very
big
step
to
take.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
go
on
what's
not
in
(b),
rule
20
isn't
in
(b)
either.
