mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
section
1367,
combined
with
section
1332,
there
clearly
were
both
original
jurisdiction
and
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
named
plaintiffs
and
class
members
in
this
case.
in
responding
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
petitioners'
counsel
chose
to
refer
to
only
one
of
two
statutes
respecting
attorney's
fees
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
in
finding
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
met
here.
at
page
79a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
you
will
find
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
1995
holding
that
there
was
original
jurisdiction,
that
the
lower
court
therefore
incorrectly
abstained
from
deciding
the
case,
and
citing
not
only
section
595,
which
justice
ginsburg
inquired
about,
but
also
citing
article
37:
137...
excuse
me,
51:
137
of
the
state
antitrust
law,
and
under
that
law
the...
there
is
a
classic
fee-shifting
statute
such
as
appears
in
many
state
statutes,
providing
that
the
prevailing
party
can
get
not
only
the
damages
sustained
but
also
the
cost
of
suit
and
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
the
two
plaintiffs
here--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--yes.
yes.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
that's
what
it
was
over
a
period
of
time,
your
honor,
and
for
numerous
purchases
during
a
year,
trebled,
but
we
would
have
a
different
case
if
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
had
stipulated
that
in
no
circumstances
would
their
fees
be
in
excess
of
the
requisite
amount,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
in
fact,
i
believe
they
have
agreed
that
there's
jurisdiction
here,
because
the
question
presented
says--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
as
the
court
observed...
as
the
court
has
observed
in
several
of
the
cases
where
you
get
involved
in
questions
of
class
action
such
as
zahn,
the
cost
of
prosecuting
a
case
like
this,
and
a
cost
of
prosecuting
that
case,
where
the
damages
were
being
claimed...
were
themselves
probably
more
than
100
dollars,
but
it
doesn't
really
matter,
50,000
dollars,
which
was
the
jurisdictional
amount
at
that
time,
is
not
an
exorbitant,
reasonable
fee
for
attorneys
to
prosecute
a
case
that
was--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i
don't
off-hand,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
and
the
district
court
both
ruled
that
a
reasonable
amount
of
fees
here,
even
for
the...
under...
the
fifth
circuit
understood
that
the
ruling
had
been
that
there
was
original
jurisdiction
for
the
two
frees.
they
ruled
that
it
could
well
be
in
excess
of
50,000
dollars.
i
submit
that
that
was
a
reasonable
judgment.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
your
honor,
you
held
in
the--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--it
includes...
your
honor
held...
your
honor,
the
court
held
in
the
missouri
interstate
insurance,
i
think
it
was,
the
jones
case
was
the
second
name,
in
1933
that
attorney's
fees
under
statutes
like
this
were
substantive
matters
and
could
be
included
for
purposes
of
determining,
and
were
included
in
that
case--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i
don't
remember
off-hand,
justice
ginsburg.
i
know
that
at
that
time,
of
course,
the
requisite
amount
was
also
substantially
lower
than
it
is
at
the
present
time.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
the
court...
the
only
thing
that's
different
between
the
two
statutes
was
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
first,
and
that
is
whether
595,
which
deals
specifically
with
class
actions,
if
this
was
not
a
class
action,
therefore
you
did
not
have
the
attribution
to
the
named
plaintiffs,
whether
the
case
did
not
fail
for
that
reason.
the
judgment
about
attorney's
fees
and
what
the
amount
reasonably
would
be
was
the
same
whether
you're
dealing
with
article
51:
137
or
with
article
595.
the
only
point
of
595
is
to
say
what
is
the
law
in
most
states
anyway,
which
is
that
the
named
plaintiffs
are
the
ones
who
are
responsible
for
the
arrangements
with
attorneys,
for
compensating
the
attorneys,
for
paying
for
the
fees
and
so
on,
so
that
as
far
as
the
question
of
the
amount
of
the
fees
is
concerned,
the
question
with
respect
to
595
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
one
with
respect
to
597.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
but
as
the
court
knows,
in
several
of
these
cases,
including
the
clark
case,
that
the
plaintiffs
are
in
effect...
the
petitioner
is
in
effect
asking
this
court
to
overrule.
the
court
was...
the
courts
were
left
with
jurisdiction
over
a
party
which
in
that
case
had
the
ad
damnum
of
the
requisite
amount,
but
the
clark
case,
as
well
as
snyder,
harris,
and,
i
submit,
the
city
of
chicago
case,
decided
two
terms
ago,
are
all
cases
which
the
petitioner's
argument
is
asking
this
court
to
overrule
in--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
snyder...
it
was
correct
in
the
holding
that
you
couldn't
aggregate,
but
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
the
case,
which
was
citing
clark,
that
you
cannot...
that
only
plaintiffs
who
have
the
requisite
amount
can
stay
in
federal
court,
both
clark
and
zahn,
because
zahn
had
four
plaintiffs,
both
of
those
were
cited
and
relied
on
clark
in
citing
the
rule
that
only
plaintiffs
who
had
the
requisite
amount
could
stay,
but
the
court
did
not
lose
jurisdiction,
because
there
had
been
plaintiffs
without
the
requisite--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
yes,
they
could,
if
the
court--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--if
the
court
reasonably
made
the
judgment
that
prosecuting
that
case
would
amount
to,
or
would
require
more
than
50,000
dollars
in
reasonable
attorney's--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i'm
not
able
to
this
morning,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition...
in
addition
to
having
original
jurisdiction
here,
which
i
think
that
1367(a)
clearly
confers
supplemental
jurisdiction,
1367(a)
confers
it,
13...
which
is
a
general
grant.
1367(b)
does
not
except
rule
23
cases
from
the
general
grant
in
(a).
a
class
action
like
this
case
is
one
that
is
so
related
as
to
form
part
of
the
same
case
or
controversy.
indeed,
to
be
in
court
under
rule
23
at
all,
as
the
court
knows,
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
must
predominate,
so
that
it's
a
classic
case
for
the
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction,
economies
to
be
derived
therefrom,
instead
of
splitting
the
case
and
having
the
people
with
original
jurisdiction
be
in
federal
court,
absent
class
members
be
in
state
court--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
they
could
all
go
to
state
court--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--but
if...
if,
justice
scalia,
the
named
plaintiffs
met
the
requisite
standards
for
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
defendants
could
remove.
you
could
have
exactly
the
situation
you
had
here,
so
that--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
that's
correct.
they
could
stay
in
federal
court
as
plaintiffs,
or
they
could
stay
in
federal
court
as
class
plaintiffs,
as
here.
but
if
i
misspoke
earlier,
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
case
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
two
frees,
and
the
two
frees
stay
in
federal
court,
and
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
we
believe
is
a
valid
judgment,
which--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--once
there
is
original
jurisdiction,
as
is,
i
believe,
set
forth
in
the
question
presented,
then
there
clearly
is
supplemental
jurisdiction
here
because
of
subsection
(a)
of
1367,
no
exception
under
subsection
(b)--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i
understand
that.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
that's
not
what
happened--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--excuse
me.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
that's
what...
no,
because
precisely
what
happened
in
clark
is
what
your
honor
is
postulating
here.
that
is,
several
people
brought
claims,
and
only
one
was
found
to
have
the
requisite
amount
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
rest
were
dismissed
from
the
case.
the
court
held
they
should
have
been
dismissed
from
the
case,
but
there
was
jurisdiction
ab
initio
over
the
one
who
had
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount.
the
position
plaintiffs
are
taking
here
is
flatly
contrary
to
clark.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
i
think
he's...
i
think
petitioner
is
clearly
wrong
on
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
statute
did
more...
indeed,
i
believe
that
the
statute
overruled
the
zahn
case,
and
the
text
of
the
statute
is
clear
with
respect
to
that,
and
all
the
petitioners
do,
and
they've
done
it
consistently
here,
is,
they
have
taken
the
proper
judicial
construction
and
the
statutory
construction
and
set
it
back.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
that...
i...
they
may
well
have
done
that
because
of
rule...
the
subsection
(b),
to
the
extent--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i
understand
that.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
carved-out
exceptions,
they
preserve
the
rule--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--strawbridge--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
anybody
ever
noticed
it
or
not,
because
the...
there
were
a
lot
of
academics
crawling
over
this
area,
as
the
court
knows,
and
they
wrote
a
lot
of
things
about
it,
including
some
in
the
legislative
history,
but
the
statute...
and
of
course
it's
well-accepted
the
statute
clearly
operates
to
say
in
this
case,
zahn
notwithstanding,
the
absent
class
members,
there
is
jurisdiction
despite
the
fact
they
may
not
make
the
requisite
amount.
does
that
make
sense?
yes,
it
does.
it
makes
zahn
parallel
to
the
rule
of
ben
hur,
for
example,
so
that
there
is
a
symmetry
there.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
didn't
say--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
they...
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
they
were
going
to
look
at
the
statutory
construction,
that's
correct.
they
were
going
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--some
of
the
commentators,
your
honor,
were
people
like
the
ones
we
cite
in
our
footnote,
in
the
footnote
at
page
6
of
our
brief,
who
stated
in
an
article
afterward
that
they
realized
that
they
had
to
correct
what
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
said,
and
so
that
footnote...
that
one
sentence
was
put
into
the
legislative
history
in
a
section
dealing
with
subsection
(b),
by
the
way.
a
sentence
was
put
in
that
said,
this
is
not
intended
to
alter
the
jurisdictional
requirements
and
divert
class
action
diversity
cases
as
set
forth
under
section
1332,
footnoting
zahn
and
ben
hur.
what
does
that
tell
us?
well,
that
phrase,
the
jurisdictional
requirements,
is
the
phrase
at
the
end
of
subsection
(b),
but
conspicuously,
although
they
were
straining
to
try
to
have
that
apply
to
(a),
they
thought,
it
wasn't
in
a
section
dealing
with
(a).
it
wasn't
ever
in
subsection
(b).
subsection
(b)
conspicuously
does
not
accept
rule
23.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--two
things
with
respect
to
your
question,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
if
you
accept
mr.
small's
argument,
petitioner's
argument
about
1367(a),
you
don't
need
(b)
at
all,
because
the
exceptions
of
(b)
are
not
necessary
if
1367(a)
already
incorporated
all
of
those
doctrines.
indeed,
in
their
brief,
once
again
they
take
it
backwards.
they
say,
1367(b)
sets
forth
what
the
applicable
rules
are,
and
1367(a)
is
a
complementary
section
which
complements
(b).
that's
backwards,
and
you
don't
need
(b)
at
all
if
they're
right
about
(a).
secondly,
there
was--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
exactly
how
they
got
there.
that
was
not
a
class
action.
that
was
a
case
of
a
couple
of
plaintiffs
who
had
different
jurisdictional
amounts,
and
the
result
they
held
was
the
same,
and
that
is
that
the
action
could
not
be
maintained
with
respect
to
those
who
were
not...
who
did
not
have
the
requisite
amount,
but
they
did
not
hold
that
persons...
the
one
who
did
have
the
requisite
amount
was
out
of
the
case,
which
is
what
he's
asking
for
here.
he's
asking
for
a
double-headed
result.
he's
asking
for
a
result
that
not
only
says
it
can't
be
a
class
action,
but
that
says
that
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
two
plaintiffs
as
to
which
there
was
jurisdiction
doesn't
stand
either,
and
that
wasn't
the--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
it
may
well
be
they
don't
want
to.
indeed,
they
didn't
want
to.
they
moved
to
remand,
and
i
would
expect
they
wouldn't
want
to,
but
the
fact
is--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
they...
and...
they
wanted
to
be
with
the
class,
and
what
they're
asking
here
now
by
the
result
they're
asking
is
that
the
court
in
effect
give
them
a
remand
by
saying
that
there
wasn't
jurisdiction.
but
the
defendants
have
rights
here,
too,
and
section
1332
makes
clear
that
assuming
the
requisite
amount
is
met,
there
is
the
entitlement
to
remove
those
people
to
federal
court
and
to
have
the
case
tried
in--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
what
you
should
do
here,
i
think,
is
that
you
should
affirm
the
fifth
circuit,
because
i
think
the
reading
of
the
statute
was
correct,
and
this
goes
to
your
question
as
well
as
the
second
part
of
justice
ginsburg's
question,
the
legislative
history
is
not
one-sided
here,
because
the
judicial...
the
court
study
commission,
which
issued
its
report
in
april
of
1990,
the
report
of
the
commission
itself
had
a
simple
statement
concerning
ancillary
jurisdiction,
or
supplemental
jurisdiction
that
it
should
be
in
anything
arising
out
of
the
same
case
or
controversy,
but
the
subcommittee,
as
the
court
knows,
chaired
by
judge
posner,
had
a
statute
very
similar
to
what
was
finally
enacted
which
did
not
refer
to
subsection,
to
rule
23
in
the
draft
of
subsection
(b),
and
which
said
the
intention...
as
the
report
said,
the
intention
was
to
overrule
zahn.
now,
judge
weis
in
particular
took...
had
a
strong
interest
in
not
expanding
diversity
jurisdiction.
but
when
he
got
before
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
in
september,
and
it
was
clear
that
there
was
not
general
satisfaction
with
the
broad
draft
that
was
being
put
forward
at
that
time,
he
offered,
in
connection
with
his
prepared
remarks,
and
it's
in
the
legislative
history,
he
offered
a
text
of
a
suggested
statute
which
was
in
all
material
respects
like
the
one
that
came
out
of
the
subcommittee
of
the
judicial
court
study
commission,
and
that,
with
some
minor
differences
in
wording,
was
what
was
finally
adopted
by
the
congress.
there
was
plenty
of
understanding
from
april
on
that
zahn
and
rule
23
were
issues
with
respect
to
this
statute,
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
academics
said,
gee,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
plain,
and
would
overrule
zahn,
we
better
get
a
sentence
into
the
legislative
report,
congress
didn't
do
that.
congress
did
not
include
rule
23
in
the
exceptions
of...
to
the
general
grant
of
subsection
(a).
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
them
to
do
it
if
there
was
an
intention
not
to
have
this
overrule
zahn,
but
i
can
understand
why
there
could
have
been
a
lot
of
reasons
why
people
in
1990,
with
the...
in...
during
the
bush
administration,
with
the
bush
justice
department
and
so
on,
might
well
not
have
wanted
to
explicitly
confront
the
issue
of
rule
23
in
the
exceptions
to
the
broad
grant,
and
therefore
it
wasn't
done.
it's
perfectly--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
that's
correct,
if...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
if
they
made
it--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--if
that
was
an
oversight
or
a
mistake,
they
can
correct
it,
and
there
is
a--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--well,
strawbridge
doesn't
go
in
its
entirety,
because
the
purpose
of
subsection,
or
the
clear
import
of
subsection
(b)
is
to
preserve
strawbridge
in
a
great
many
examples.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
justice
breyer--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--i'm
not
saying
read
in
some
exceptions.
i'm
saying
that
your
interpretation
is
a
correct
one
of
how
the
statute
leaves
us,
and
that
may
be
an
interpretation
that
in
a
certain
circumstance
is
problematical,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
entire
statute
is
absurd,
wrong,
or
only
meant
to
apply,
or
only
should
apply
to
finley,
which
is
what
the
plaintiffs
are
asking
the
court
to
do.
the
fact
is
that
with
respect
to
the
issue
here,
absent
class
members,
amount-in-controversy,
the
statute
makes
sense.
it...
the
statute
is
clear.
the
statute
makes
sense.
if
there
is
some
other
tinkering
that
needs
to
be
done
in
another
area
because
the
exceptions
that
were
put
in
were
not
broad
enough
to
accomplish
a
result
with
respect
to
strawbridge,
congress
can
do
that,
but
the
exception--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--1806,
i
think.
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what's
happened
here,
perhaps,
with
respect
to
that,
is
one
of
those
gotchas
that
judge
pollack
talks
about
in
one
of
the
cases
that's
cited
here
and
that
comes
up
in
certain
places,
and
that
is
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
multiple
plaintiffs
under
rule
20,
that
the
exceptions
that
were
carved
out
may
not
have
been
broad
enough
to
preserve
in
its
entirety
strawbridge,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
statute
should
lead
one,
should
lead
the
court
to
the
other
extreme;
that
is,
to
import
into
it,
into
subsection
(a)
a
meaning
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
with
respect
to
having--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--subsection
(b)
at
all.
you
don't
need
(b)
if
you
have
(a).
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
your
honor,
but
that's
not
what...
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
here,
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
held,
and
judge
posner
in
another
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
same
thing,
is
that
rule
23,
which
is
not
included
in
the
carve-outs
of
subsection
(b),
rule
23
allows
this
case
to
go
forward
with
the
absent
class
members.
it's
not
shocking.
it's
sensible.
it's
in
accord
with--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--that's
correct
with
respect
to
multiple
plaintiffs.
rule
20
is
in
with
respect
to
multiple
defendants,
but
not
with
respect
to
multiple
plaintiffs.
that
was
pointed
out--
mr.
frank
cicero,
jr.
--thank
you
very
much.
