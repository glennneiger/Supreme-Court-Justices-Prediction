unless
they
all
qualify,
nobody
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
the
rule
that's
applied
for
diversity.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
just
urging
that
the
same
rule
be
applied
for
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
say
it
would
require
us
to
come
out
the
other
way
in
the
next
finley
case,
not
just
think
about
it
again.
it
would
reverse
the
outcome
in
finley.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
finley
was
a
case
involving
supplemental
jurisdiction,
not
involving
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place,
or,
i'm
sorry,
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place,
involving
supplemental
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
1367
deals
with
what,
supplemental
jurisdiction,
not
original
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
be
more
likely
for
1367
to
be
addressing
itself
to
finley
than
to
zahn.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
were
going
to
address
zahn,
presumably
you'd
be
more
likely
to
do
it
in
1332,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
also
had
a
point
about
an
inconsistency
that's
created
if
you
interpret
1367
in
such
a
fashion
as
saying...
as
overruling
zahn.
namely,
as
saying
that
the
courts
somehow
have
original
jurisdiction
so
long
as
one
of
the
parties
meets
the
federal
requirement.
what
is
the
inconsistency
that
you're
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cicero,
have
we
ever
held
that
for
purposes
of
the
amount-in-controversy
statutes
attorney's
fees
are
included?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
major
federal
question,
it
seems...
you
think
the
amount-in-controversy
doesn't
just
mean
the
claim,
but
it
also
includes
attorney's
fees?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
could
all
go
to
state
court.
there...
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
problem
of
not
being
able
to
get
it
all
in
state
court.
you're
not
talking
federal
question.
you're
talking
diversity.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
your
opponent
contests
precisely
whether
there
is
original
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
contests
your
assertion
that
by
reason
of
clark,
when
you
file
a
suit
in
which
some
of
the
plaintiffs
do
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement,
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
suit.
i
think
that's
highly
questionable.
suppose
you
refuse
to
dismiss.
suppose
you
refuse
to
dismiss
those
plaintiffs
who
do
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement.
let's
say...
let's
assume
they're
all
named
plaintiffs,
not
even
a
class
action.
you
refuse
to
dismiss
those
named
plaintiffs
who
do
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement.
what
would
the
judgment
of
the
court
be?
would
it
be
judgment
on
the
merits
against
those
plaintiffs
who
do
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirement,
or
what,
dismissal
only
as
to
them?
i
think
not.
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
dismiss
the
entire
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
and
until
you
dismiss--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
people
who
don't
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
response
to
the
contention
that
(b)
of
1367
is
meaningless
if
your
interpretation
is
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
