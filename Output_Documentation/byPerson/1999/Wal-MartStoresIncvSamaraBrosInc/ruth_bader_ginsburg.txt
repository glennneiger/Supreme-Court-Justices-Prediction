justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
you're
making
that
we
should...
we
should
confine
two
pesos
to
the
packaging
and...
trade
dress,
as
i
understand
it,
covers
both
the...
the
package
that
the
product
comes
in
and
the
product
itself.
you
are
conceding
that
the
product
itself
could
have
acquired
distinctiveness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
two
pesos
doesn't
seem
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
packaging
and
the
product.
do
we
even
know
what
the
decor
of
the
rest
are?
whether...
whether
that
was...
where
that
fit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
the
qualification
that
you're
asking
to
confine
two
pesos
to
packaging
cases
as
opposed
to
product
cases?

mr.
wallace--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
wallace,
because
you
have
so
little
time,
but...
to
help
us
with
the
who
decides
question?
you
said
seabrook.
that's
a
good
formula.
you
didn't
want
to
tell
us
how
it
would
apply
in
this
case.
but
who...
who
applies
it?
does
this
case...
can
you
tell
us?
does
this
case
go
to
the
jury
and
is
seabrook
the
charge
that
you
would
recommend
for
the
jury?
or
does
this
case
not
go
to
the
jury?
i'm
really
troubled.
in
most
of
these
cases,
they
go
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
hasn't
got
a
clue
what
that
charge
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you
ask
us
to...
to
adopt
the
seabrook
standard,
do
we
adopt
it
as
a
charge
for
the
jury
or
as
a
screen
to
see
whether
the
case
goes
to
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
are
these
dresses
just
inherently
descriptive
as
opposed
to
distinctive?
i
mean,
you
expect
to
find
children's
clothes
to
be
pretty,
to
have
appliques,
to
be
of
washable
material.
and
so,
i...
why
would
a
juror
think
that
there's
anything
about
this
that
would
be
indicative
of
a
source
rather
than
just
being
a
nice,
decorative
pattern?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
judge
newman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--didn't
think
that
because
didn't
he
suggest
that
the
simplicity
pattern
looked
like
the
samara
dress?
