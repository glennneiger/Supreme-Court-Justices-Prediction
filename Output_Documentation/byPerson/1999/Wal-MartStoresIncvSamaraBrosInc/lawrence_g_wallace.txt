mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
this
court
had
held
in
the
qualitex
case
that
color
is
an
inherently
distinctive
source
identifying
characteristic
of
products,
the
patent
and
trademark
office
would
have
been
flooded
with
applications
for
color
marks
and
we
would
have
been
well
on
our
way
to
having
color-coded
industries.
and
the
expectations
of
consumers
would,
likewise,
have
been
affected.
they
would
have
begun
thinking
of
color
as
source
identifying
more
than
they
had
prior
to
the
decision.
instead,
the
court
looked
toward
the
traditional
remedial
role
of
finding
that
secondary
meaning
had
been
established
for
the
use
of
color
on
a
particular
product
in
a
particular
industry
and
someone
was
appropriating
the
good
will
in
a
way
that
was
deserving
of
protection.
it's
possible,
in
other
words,
for
the
courts
to
get
too
far
out
in
front
on
these
issues
in
interpreting
the
law,
and
there
can
be
self-fulfilling
prophecies
of
what
becomes
source
identifying,
and
industries
can
become
regimented
into
each
producer
having
his
own
little
niche.
that...
that
is
the
danger
of
too
receptive
a
standard
of
inherent
distinctiveness.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
i
was
trying
to
lead
up
to
is
that
that
is
the
utility...
the
utility
that
has
been
found
in
applying
the
so-called
seabrook
approach.
it's
not
that
it
provides
an
intellectually
satisfying
abstract
definition.
it's
very
hard
to
come
up
with
anything
of
that
sort
in
this
context,
but
that
it...
it
requires
the
courts
to
ask
a
series
of
practical
questions
that
appropriately
distinguish
what
is
a
permissible
protection
for
inherent
distinctiveness
without
getting
the
courts
out
in
front.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--this
is
a
very
difficult
case
for
that
purpose.
in
a
way
it's
a
good
case
for
that
reason,
but
in
a
way
it's
a
hard
one
to
address.
there...
i
mean,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
if
the...
the
holding
that
there
was
inherent
distinctiveness
in
this
configuration
alternately
prevails,
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
there...
there
would
likely
be
some
tendency
of
other
manufacturers
to
come
up
with
their
own
configurations
of
appliques
to
seersucker
garments--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
what...
what
we
suggest
is
that
there
is
a
responsibility
on
the
courts
to
determine
whether
applying
the
seabrook
factors
to
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
jury,
there
is
a
basis
for
a
finding--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
reasonable
basis.
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
in
the
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i...
what...
what
we
learned
from
the
patent
office
in
looking
at
this
is
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
conclude,
in
a
registration
process,
that
there
was
anything
inherently
distinctive
about
the
individual
garments
that
were
at
issue
here.
they
used
common
elements
that
the
seabrook
inquiry
would
not
ordinarily
allow
protection
for.
the
claim
here
was
not
a
claim
that
any
particular
garment
was
entitled
to
protection
or
that
any
particular
garment
was
infringed,
but
it
was
a
claim
about
the...
the
overall
appearance
or
look
of
a
line
of
garments
even
though
the
garments
held
to
infringe
more
closely
resembled
individual
garments
than
they
resembled
this
abstraction
which
was
based
on
certain
common
characteristics
that
sometimes
were
variable
and
sometimes
didn't
even
appear
in
certain
garments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that...
functionality
is
a
separate
inquiry
from
whether
a
characteristic
is
source
identifying
to
consumers.
you
can
find
that
consumers
actually
think
that
a
particularly
pleasing
item
comes
from
a
particular
source.
you
can
prove
secondary
meaning,
but
still
it
could
be
unprotectable
because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
can...
it
can
be
if...
if
the
ability
to
compete
in
this
market
is
impeded
by
denying
access
to
competitors
to
a
similarly
pleasing
combination
of
very
familiar
elements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
could
easily
view
this
case
as
one
where
the
copyright
protection
that
was
afforded
from
direct
and
duplication
suffices
and
otherwise
the
industry
is
being
too
impeded
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i...
i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
certainly
would
be
no
protection
but
not
because
there
isn't
inherent
distinctiveness.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
also--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
that's
right.
there...
of
course,
there
could
be
copyright
protection
for
a
work
of
art.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
you
know,
there...
there
is
much
that
we...
we
really
think
there's
much
wisdom
in
judge
newman's
dissenting
remarks
on
this
issue,
that
you
can't
cede
so
much
authority
to
the
juries
that
they're
deciding
what
the
scope
of
the
law
is.
but
this
was
a
question
presented
in
the
petition
that
was
excluded
from
the
grant
and
we
didn't
brief
it.
so,
i...
i
can't
really
say
much
beyond
that
question.
we
do
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i...
i
think
that
it...
it
really
is
a
screen
for
judges,
so
far
as...
as
i'm
able
to
answer
the
question,
although
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
error
to
charge
a
jury.
it's
just
a
question
we
have
not
briefed.
it
was
a
question
excluded
from
the
grant.
we
go
through
a
process
in
trying
to
arrive
at
an
answer
to
questions
of
this
sort.
i
do
want
to
say
that
there
is
room
for
more
skepticism
about
a
claim
of
inherent
distinctiveness
when
the
inherent
distinctiveness
cannot
be
perceived
in
any
one
item,
but
can
only
be
perceived
by
extracting
characteristics
from
a
line
of
items.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's...
it's
impossible
to
find
it,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there's
more
reason
for
skepticism.
