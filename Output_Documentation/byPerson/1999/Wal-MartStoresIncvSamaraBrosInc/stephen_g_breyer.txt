justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
should
it
always?
i
mean,
you
could
have
a
weird
situation.
imagine
you
made
a
hair
brush
in
the
shape
of
a
grape,
you
know,
and
they
continuously...
that
was
it.
it's
called
the
grape
hairbrush,
and
that's
it.
i
mean,
that's
so
weird
that
i
guess
that
people
would
pick
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does.
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
not
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
point
is
why
couldn't
you...
since
we
said
you
could
in
two
pesos,
why
isn't
two
pesos
basically
right
that
it
may
require
something
special
and
rather
unusual,
but
not
impossible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes,
it
does
after
a
while.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
sure...
no,
no,
no.
all
the
products
are
grape.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
wonder
what's
it...
going
on
here
with
this
grape,
et
cetera.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
was
like
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
whole
line.
it's
a
grape
hairbrush,
a
grape
comb,
a
grape
hair
curler,
and
a
grape...
you
know,
et
cetera.
and
so,
almost
instantly
when
you
see
it
there,
you
get
the
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
really
saying
i
don't...
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to...
why
should
we
overrule
two
pesos?
it
isn't
really
what
you
want
us
to...
to
narrow
it
to
make
sure
that
it
really
is
an
arbitrary
kind
of
situation
where
source
is
pretty
readily
indicated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
color
is
functional,
and
i
think...
color
is
functionality,
which
i
think
qualitex
came
pretty
close
to
saying,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
then
shape
would
be
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
there's
no
basis
for
a
distinction
there.
but...
but
then
do
we
have
to
overrule
two
pesos?
i
mean,
i
think
justice
scalia
is
right.
i
agree
with
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no,
no.
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so...
so,
are
you
saying
now
we
should
overrule
two
pesos--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
that
we
should--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
inherent...
i
know
you're
going
to
do
that,
but
if
it's...
i
just
want
to...
justice
scalia
and
the
answer
to
my
question
have
thrown
me
a
little
bit.
and
i...
i'd
like
you
to
focus,
when
you
go
through
this
list,
on
the
particular
thing
that
they
brought
up,
which
is
where
you
have
a
word,
it's
pretty
easy
to
think
of
an
arbitrary
or
fanciful
word
that
clearly
is
meant
to
designate
source.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
why
bother
with
the
secondary
meaning
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
they've
suddenly
got
me
thinking
is...
it's
very
hard
to
find
an
example
of
a
shape
or
a
configuration
where
you
could
say
the
same
because
of
what
justice
scalia
said
because
where
you
do
have
a
weird
shape
or
even
a
coke
bottle,
you
see,
the
classic,
the
coke
bottle...
i
mean,
where
you
do
have
that,
the
natural
human
reaction
is
to
think,
well,
they're
trying
to
attract
customers
by
the
shape.
they're
not
trying
to
indicate
source.
they're
trying
to...
they're
trying
to...
it's
weird,
a
grape
brush.
it's...
and
even
the
two
pesos,
you
see?
so...
so,
if
that's
so,
why
not
force
people
at
least
to
prove
secondary
meaning
so
we
don't
get
into
all
the
rest
of
this
case?
i
mean,
there
we've
got...
and
that
solves
the
problem
that
he
brought
up.
it
does
force
us
either
to
change
two
pesos
or
to
create
a
new,
difficult
distinction,
the
one
between
packaging
and
trade
dress.
but
maybe
now
i'm
thinking
those
are
the
lesser
of
the
evils.
so...
so,
i
grant
you
those
would
be
bad,
either
of
those
two,
but
maybe
this...
this
new
distinction
would
be
the
lesser
evil.
so,
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
we
don't
want
is
to
have
the
lanham
act
protecting
a
shape
because
it's
an
attractive
shape
or
even
a
repellant
shape
that
people
would
buy
something
because
of
the
shape.
that's
just
what
you
don't
want.
you
want
to
give
total
freedom
to
do
that
and
use
the
copyright
act
if
they
want
to
protect
it.
you
don't
want
the
lanham
act
to
protect
that
even
to
1
inch.
all
you
want
the
lanham
act
to
protect
is
the
source,
the
fact
that
the
customer
thinks,
oh,
i
see
what
that
means,
it's
a
coke
bottle.
coke
produced
it.
but
there
was
secondary
meaning
proved.
so,
why
not
always
force
them
to
that
proof
where
you're
dealing
with
a
shape?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
why
we
want
to
do
it.
i
mean,
the
lanham
act
doesn't
tell
us
this...
i'm
not
saying
they
can't.
i'm
just
saying
that...
that
let's
at
least,
before
we
start
interfering
with
aesthetic
and
other
purposes,
force
the
plaintiff
to
the
proof
that
people
really
do
think
this
indicates
a
source
rather
than
having
a
judge
or
a
jury
guess
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we...
if
we
think...
if
we
think,
see,
as
in
color,
you
know,
that
there's
risks
of
the
kind,
do
we
do
any
harm
by
saying...
of
course,
we
might
in
your
case.
i
understand
that,
but
in
general--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
in...
in
general,
do...
do
we
cause
a
problem
for
the
lawyers
who
practice
in
this
area
or
others
if
we
were
to
say,
look,
all
we're
saying
is
show
secondary
meaning.
that
way
we
know
that
people
really
do
associate
this
shape
or
dress
with
a
source.
that's
all.
we're
just
asking
you
don't
let
them
go
on
a
hunch.
just...
just
bring
in
some
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
we
take
your
preferred
way
of
doing
it,
which
is
to
leave
the
functionality
question
as
a
subsidiary
question
coming
in
at
the
end.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
or
the
functionality
question
becomes
a
separate
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
say
you
could
include
aesthetic
considerations
as
functionality.
but
then
that's
not
this
question.
this
question
is
do
we
get
down
the
track
by...
by
asking
if
this
particular
shape
or
design
is
meant
to
identify
a
source.
that's
the
question
before
us.
right?
and
the...
the
issue
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
sometimes
it
could
be
so
unique
that
that's
what
it
does.
suppose
you
took
the
seabrook
factors,
those
three
questions,
which
basically
say,
look,
if
this
is
normal
or
it's
just
ornamentation,
forget
it,
you're
out
the
window.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you...
could
you
add
to
that
the
very
question
we
want
to
know?
suppose
you
also
said
and
you
must
say
to
the
jury,
jury,
do
you
believe
that
when
you
look
at
this,
it's
not
only
unique,
this
shape
or
dress,
but
the
very
way
in
which
it's
unique
in
this
industry
is
likely
to
indicate
to
a
person
that
why
they've
done
it
is
to
show
a
source,
not
just
beauty,
not
just...
i
mean,
could
you
ask...
i
could
get
a
better
formula--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
it's
different.
but
inherent
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
inherent
distinguish...
inherent
distinctiveness
of
the
source...
of
the
sort
that
would
tend
to
identify
a
source,
not
inherent
distinctiveness
of
the
sort
that
would
lead
a
person
to
buy
something
for
its
beauty
or
shape.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
really
true
where
you're
talking
about
a
shape
or
trade
dress.
indeed,
dress
designers
make
their
money
out
of
making
something
that
is
unique
and
beautiful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
seabrook
doesn't
distinguish
between
that
which
is
unique
and...
and
attracts
customers
because
it's
beautiful
and
unique
and
that
which
attracts
customers
only
because
it
is
unique
and
thereby
indicates
source.
and
my
question
to
you
is
should
this
court,
in
trying
to
list
tests,
take
seabrook
and
add
to
it
a
question
that
would
make
that
very
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
why
did
you
respond
to
justice
scalia...
i
think
it
was
justice
scalia
or
justice
souter's
earlier
question...
no,
or
that
there
would...
remember?
i
think
their
question
was
about
somebody
creates
a
beautiful
design
or
a
beautiful
thing
that
does
indicate
the
source,
but
it's
also
beautiful,
and
they
don't
take
out
copyright
protection.
and
you
said,
well,
then
there
would
be
lanham
act
protection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
other
words...
now,
what
would
you
have
to
show?
you'd
come
in
and
say
i
agree
it
indicates
that
it's
a
dior
dress,
but
he
didn't
get
his
design
copyright,
and
so
i
can
go
copy
it.
and
now
you...
you
assert
now
it's
a
lanham
act
violation,
and
the
defendant
says
not
at
all.
he
says
it's...
because
there
it's
serving
a
functional
purpose,
the
purpose
of
beauty
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see
what
the...
the
problem
is
going
to
be
showing
the
harm
to
competition,
and
that's
going
to
lead
to
a
big
argument.
