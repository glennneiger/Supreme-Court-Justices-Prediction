m.

well,
i
take
it
you
think
that
a
properly
instructed
jury
could
rule
for
samara
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
know
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
want
to
know
your...
your
answer.
do
you
think
a
properly
instructed
jury
could
find
for
samara,
if
i'm
pronouncing
it
right,
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
doesn't...
doesn't
intent
indicate
that
the
second
manufacturer
recognized
the
distinctiveness
and
that's
why
he
wanted
to
do
it?
so,
intent
is...
is
relevant.
you
wouldn't
say
that
intent
is
irrelevant.
