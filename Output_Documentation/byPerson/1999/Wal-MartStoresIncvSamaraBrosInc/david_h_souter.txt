david
h.
souter
--you
say
that
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
do
we
then
have
the
same
difficulty
that
we
have
with
the
difference
between
product
and
packaging?
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
say
that
whenever
a...
a
product
is
purchased
at
least
primarily
for
or
substantially
for
an
aesthetic
reason,
which
is
easy
to
say,
i
guess,
in
the
case
of
a
dress
or
a
car,
that
in
fact
at
that
point
the...
the
aesthetics
really
is
the...
the
function.
but
isn't
that
simply
going
to
lead
to
a...
a
totally
porous
distinction?
you
know,
i...
i
buy
the
comb.
there...
there
are
different
shapes
of
combs.
they
all
have
teeth.
some
have
longer
teeth,
some
have
shorter
teeth.
aren't
we
simply
going
to
be
met
with
the
argument,
well,
there
was...
there
was
an
aesthetic
component
there?
and
are
we
simply
going
to
end
up
with
a
distinction
which...
which
we
can't
maintain?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
at
least
have
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--don't
we
at
least
have
to
say
that
the
more
important
the
aesthetic
element
is
in
the
consumer's
decision,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
prove
inherent
distinctiveness,
the
less
likely
that
there
is
inherent
distinctiveness?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
let's
assume
for
the...
for
the
sake
of
answering
justice
breyer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
i
want
to
ask
the
same
question
he
wants
to
ask.
assume
just
for
the
sake
of
that
answer
that
maybe
we...
we
didn't
get
it
right
in
two
pesos.
what's
the
right
answer?
forget
two
pesos
for
a
minute.
are
there
going
to
be
so
many
negative
answers
that
the
sensible
rule
would
be
to
require
proof
of
secondary
meaning
in
the
meaning
in
the
first
place?
then
everybody
knows
where
he
stands,
and
the
likelihood
that
our
answer
is
going
to...
that
we
do
finally
get
is
simply
going
to
be
on
the
basis
of,
you
know,
the
hunch
is
going
to
be
greatly
reduced.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
a
practical
suggestion?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
isn't
this
simply
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
it's
always...
there's
something
ultimately
time
based
about
secondary
meaning?
that's
going
to
be
true
in
every
secondary
meaning
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
you
may
well
be
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume...
let's
assume--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
i...
i'll
make
that
assumption
that
i
can't
make
that
distinction.
i
don't
know
how
to...
i
don't
know
how...
frankly,
i
don't
know
how
you
apply
it
in
two
pesos.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
don't
they
get
protected?
the...
the
producer
who
comes
up
with
the...
the
first
time
with
the
nose
in
the
ear.
why
doesn't
the
producer
get
protected
with
a
design
patent?
and
if
then,
in
the
course
of
the...
the
life
of
the
design
patent,
the
producer
can
establish
the...
the
identification
of
the...
of
the
nose
in
the
ear
with
him,
he
then
will
get
lanham
act
protection.
that
way
we
don't
calcify
product
design,
but
we
do
gain
a
greater
assurance
in
the
conclusion
that
we're
supposed
to
draw
for
lanham
act
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
you're
going
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
on
this?
if
you're
going
to
have
the
seabrook
test--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
the
seabrook
test
looking
to
the
same
kind
really
of
novelty
for
purposes
of
differentiation
which
you're
telling
me
the
design
patentee
has
got
to
show
in
order
to
get
his
design
patent.
so,
isn't
there
a
consistency
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wouldn't
have
been
before
the
jury,
but
would
it...
it
legally
would
have
been
the
same.
