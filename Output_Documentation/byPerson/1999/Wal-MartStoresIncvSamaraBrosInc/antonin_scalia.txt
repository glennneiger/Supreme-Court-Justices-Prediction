justice

scalia
--mr.
coston,
before
you
get
into
that,
i'm
not
completely
clear
on...
on
this
first
question
about
the
instructions
below.
i
had
thought
that
what
you're
arguing
here...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
not
that
the
instructions
were
wrong,
but
simply
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
under
a
proper
criterion
to
go
to
the
jury
and
that
you
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regardless
of
your...
you're
not
complaining
about
the
instructions.
you're
just
saying
in
this
case,
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
we
not
only
have
to
agree
with
you
about
the
standard,
but
we
also
have
to
agree
that
if
we
apply
that
standard,
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
come
out
finding
your...
your
client
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
coston,
whether
i'm
willing
to
accept
your
first
argument,
which
is
that
configuration
can
never
qualify
as
trade
dress
or...
or
your
second
one,
which
is...
would
apply
a
starchier
test
for
configuration,
depends
for
me
largely
upon
whether
aesthetics
on
a
product,
the
shape
of
a
product
is
pleasing,
whether
that
is
functionality
or
not.
if
it's...
if...
if
that
is
functional,
then...
then
it...
you
know,
it
can't...
it
can't
constitute
trade
dress
even
if
the
other...
even
if
the
other
conditions
are
met.
and...
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
think
it's
functional
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
see,
i
see
a
big
difference
between
let's...
you
know,
kids
like
to...
like
to
have
brand
name
basketball
shoes.
and
let's
assume
that
a...
a
company
comes
out
with
a
basketball
shoe
that
has
a
big
lump,
just
a
big
lump,
over
the
big
toe.
it
has
no
function
whatever
and
it
is
ugly
as
sin.
and...
and
the
kids
somehow...
you
know,
they
get
on
to
this,
and
they...
they
want
people
to
know
that
they
are
wearing
that
company's
shoes,
so
they
wear
these
shoes
with
the
ugly,
big
lump
on
the
toe.
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
but
i
do
have
a
problem
with...
with
somebody
who...
who
creates
a
beautiful
dress
and
the
beauty,
it
seems
to
me,
may
well
be
part
of
the
functionality
of...
of
the
product.
and
you
mean
just
because
i'm
the
first
one
to
have
discovered
this
beautiful
thing,
nobody
else
can
create
beautiful
things
like
that.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
beauty
is...
is
functional,
then
you
should
get
a
design
patent
for
it
and...
and
protect...
protect
your
right
to
that
particular
beautiful
thing,
but
only
for
what?
17
years,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
--shape
is
not
necessarily
functional.
you
don't
say
it
necessarily
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
may
be
if...
if
its
purpose
is
aesthetic
as
opposed
to
the
lump
on
the
toe.
and
that's
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
aesthetically
pleasing
element?
i
mean,
what...
what
if
people
were
buying
these...
these
knock-offs
just
because
they...
they
think
it's
pretty,
this
kind
of
design?
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
that
is
a
functional
element,
this
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but...
but
without
proving
secondary
meaning,
if
it's
functional,
you're...
you're
home
free.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
the
person
who
copies
is
home
free.
now,
is...
is
this...
is
the
aesthetically
pleasing
nature
of
these
clothes
not
a...
not
a
functional
element
of...
of
the
product?
justice
antonin
scalia
seersucker,
watermelons,
you
know,
collars,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
say
a
modern
artist
who...
who
comes
up
with
the
idea
of,
you
know,
putting
a
nose
where...
where
the
ear
ought
to
be.
you
know,
he's
the
first
one
to
do
it.
no
one
has
ever
done
it
before.
now,
if...
if
somebody
else
decides,
gee,
people
like
that,
i'll
do
the
same
thing,
i...
i
think
even
though
it
was
totally
distinctive,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
because
seabrook
is
so
vague,
it's
consistent
with
almost
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
it
doesn't
prove
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
non-functional
arrangement
that...
but
you
assume
that...
that
aesthetics
are
separate
from
functionality.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
a
function
of
a
dress
is
to
look
pretty.
one
of
its...
one
of
its
functions
is
to
cover
the
body,
but
certainly
another
function
is
to
look
pretty.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
would
you
want
to
prevent
other
people
from
copying
a
beautiful
thing
that
one
manufacturer
has
created.
if...
if
it's
beautiful,
they
ought
to
be
free
to
copy
it
unless...
unless
it
is
misleading
consumers
into
thinking
that...
that
it's
the
product
of
somebody
else.
but
i
don't
see
you
can
say
that
just
because
they're
copying
beauty
that...
that
was
first
created
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
always
going
to
be
the
case
when...
when
the...
a
first
person...
the
person
first
discovers
a
new
manner
of
beauty
such
as
the
nose
coming
out
of
the
ear,
if
one
considers
that
beauty.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
would
say,
oh
my
god,
that's
picasso,
but
it
turns
out
it
wasn't
picasso
because
other
artists
copied
the
same
thing.
now,
if
picasso
wanted
to,
you
know,
copyright
the
nose
coming
out
of
the
ear,
i
suppose
he
could
have
done
that
or
maybe
gotten
a
design
patent.
but
i
don't
see
why
he
should
have
had...
had
protection
for
it
under
the
lanham
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't...
you
think
the
product
would
be
a
product?
i
mean,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
piece
of
cloth
that...
that
can
cover
your
body,
and...
and
that's...
that's
all
that
goes
into
a
dress.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
first
person
who
comes
up
with
a
thing
of
beauty,
a
distinctive
aspect
of
beauty,
of
course,
since
he's
the
first
one
to
come
up
with
it,
he'll
be
identified
with
it.
and
he
gets
protection
for
that
automatically
not
by
reason
of
any
copyright
protection
or
design
patent
protection,
but
just
because,
since
he's
the
first
one
to
invent
it,
everyone
will
think
that
something
that
is
just
as
pretty
in
the
same
way
must
come
from
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
sure,
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
the...
but
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act
is
not
to
give
him
dibs
on...
on
one
particular
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
other
people
be
able
to...
to
use
that
same
aspect
of
beauty?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
respondent
samara
brothers
designs
and
manufactures
a
line
of
children’s
clothing.
petitioners
wal-mart
stores
contracted
with
the
supplier
to
manufacture
outfits
based
on
photographs
of
samara’s
garments.
after
discovering
that
wal-mart
and
other
retailers
were
selling
the
so-called
knockoffs,
samara
brought
this
action
for,
among
other
things,
infringement
of
unregistered
trade
dress
under
section
43(a)
of
the
trademark
act
of
1946,
known
as
the
lanham
act.
the
jury
found
for
samara,
wal-mart
then
renewed
a
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
claiming
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
a
conclusion
that
samara’s
clothing
designs
were
protected
by
section
43(a),
since
they
were
neither
inherently
distinctive
nor
had
acquired
distinctiveness
through
secondary
meaning,
concepts
that
i
will
explain
shortly.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
awarded
samara
relief.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
denial.
we
reverse.
section
43(a)
of
lanham
act
gives
a
producer
a
cause
of
action
for
the
use
by
any
person
of
“any
symbol
or
device
likely
to
cause
confusion
as
to
the
origin
of
his
or
her
goods.”
section
43(a)
has
been
read
to
protect
not
just
word
marks,
such
as
nike
and
symbol
marks
such
as
nike’s
swoosh
symbol,
but
also
trade
dress,
a
category
that
originally
included
only
packaging
or
dressing
of
a
product.
but
in
recent
years
this
has
been
expanded
by
many
courts
of
appeals
to
encompass
the
product’s
design.
although
section
43(a)
does
not
explicitly
require
a
producer
to
show
that
its
trade
dress
is
distinctive,
courts
have
universally
imposed
that
requirement,
since
without
distinctiveness,
the
trade
dress
would
not
“cause
confusion
as
to
origin,”
as
section
43(a)
requires.
in
evaluating
distinctiveness,
courts
have
differentiated
between
marks
that
are
inherently
distinctive,
such
as
the
word
mark
“kodak”
in
kodak
film,
which
by
its
nature
connotes
nothing
except
the
source
of
the
product,
and
marks
that
have
acquired
distinctiveness
through
secondary
meaning.
such
as
the
word
mark,
“tasty”
in
tasty
bread
which
has
a
primary
meaning
of
its
own,
but
has
come
through
usage
to
be
identified
by
consumers
with
a
particular
brand
of
bread.
we
have
previously
held
however
that
applications
of
at
least
one
category
of
mark,
color
can
never
be
inherently
distinctive,
but
can
only
be
protected
upon
a
showing
of
secondary
meaning.
it
seems
to
us
that
design
like
color,
cannot
be
inherently
distinctive.
the
attribution
of
inherent
distinctiveness
to
certain
categories
of
word
marks
and
product
packaging
derives
from
the
fact
that
the
very
purpose
of
attaching
a
particular
word
to
a
product,
or
encasing
it
in
a
distinctive
package
is
most
often
to
identify
the
product
source.
where
it
is
not
reasonable
to
assume
consumer
predisposition
to
take
an
affixed
word
or
packaging
as
indication
of
source,
inherent
distinctiveness
will
not
be
found.
which
is
why,
the
lanham
act
does
not
allow
product
descriptive
terms,
such
as
“tasty”
in
tasty
bread
or
geographically
descriptive
terms,
such
as
“georgia”
in
georgia
peaches,
to
be
registered
without
a
showing
of
secondary
meaning.
in
this
regard,
in
the
expectations
that
arouses
in
consumers,
we
think
product
design
is
like
color.
consumers
are
aware
of
the
reality
that
almost
invariably,
even
the
most
unusual
of
product
designs,
such
as
a
cocktail
shaker
shaped
like
a
penguin
is
intended
not
to
identify
the
source,
but
to
render
the
product
itself
more
useful
or
more
appealing.
this
factor
not
only
renders
inherent
distinctiveness
most
unlikely,
it
also
renders
a
finding
of
inherent
distinctiveness
harmful
to
other
consumer
interests.
consumers
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
competition
with
regard
to
the
utilitarian
and
aesthetic
purposes
that
product
design
serves
by
a
rule
of
law
that
facilitates
plausible
threats
of
suit
against
new
entrants.
we
conclude
therefore
that
product
design
cannot
be
inherently
distinctive,
but
to
achieve
protection
under
section
43(a)
must
be
shown
to
have
acquired
secondary
meaning.
contrary
to
respondents
assertion,
this
conclusion
is
not
foreclosed
by
our
decision
in
two
pesos,
inc.
versus
taco
cabana,
inc.,
which
found
inherent
distinctiveness
in
the
trade
dress,
the
décor
of
a
particular
restaurant.
in
our
view,
restaurant
décor
does
not
constitute
product
design,
but
rather
product
packaging
or
else
some
“tertium
quid”
that
is
akin
to
product
packaging
and
has
no
bearing
on
the
present
case.
while
distinguishing,
two
pesos
might
force
courts
to
draw
difficult
lines
between
product
design
and
product
packaging
trade
dress,
the
frequency
and
difficulty
of
having
to
distinguish
between
those
two,
will
be
much
less
than
the
frequency
and
difficulty
of
having
to
decide
when
a
product
design
is
inherently
distinctive.
to
the
extent
there
are
close
cases,
courts
should
err
on
the
side
of
caution
and
classify
ambiguous
trade
dress
as
product
design,
thereby
requiring
secondary
meaning.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
