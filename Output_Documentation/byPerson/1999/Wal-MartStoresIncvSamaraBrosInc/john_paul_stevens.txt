it
isn't
quite
that,
is
it?
could
it
not
be
the
fact
that
the...
a...
the
only
thing
inherently
distinctive
is
itself
functional?
then
there
would
be
no
protection
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
there
could
be
some
inherently
distinctive
feature
that
was
a
functional
feature
that
would
preclude
protection
without
secondary
meaning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
think
the
assumption
in
two
pesos
was
that
it
was...
it
was
not
the
dining
experience
because
then
it
would
have
been
part
of
the
product,
and
i
think
it
was
treated
as
though
it
was
part
of
the
packaging.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
was
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
was
the
assumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
draw
a
distinction...
maybe
it's
pretty
fine...
between
packaging
and
product,
though,
and
one
can
interpret
two
pesos
to
just
relate
to
packaging
rather
than
product.
and
one
can
also,
although
there
really
is
some
tension
in
it,
to
say
that
in...
in
a
line
of
clothing
that
appeals
to
the
aesthetics
of
the...
of
the
purchaser,
that
aesthetics
in
that
context
is
functional
and
part
of
the...
and
therefore,
distinctiveness
would
not
qualify
for
lanham
act
protection
but
would
qualify
for
copyright
protection.
it
seems
you
could
fit
that
scheme
together
i
think.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
the
argument.
i
can't
remember
exactly
how
it
was
phrased,
but
that
the...
all
the
mexican
features
of
their
restaurants
had
nothing...
was
not
functional
at
least
and,
therefore,
was
more
like
a
packaging...
more
like
packaging
than
the
product
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
essential
to
your
case
that
wal-mart
copied
these
designs?
supposing
they
had
independently
come
up
with
their
line
without
copying
but
just
came
a
little
bit
later
than
yours.
would
the
result
of
the
case
had
been
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other...
one
other...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
of
your
position.
assume
no
secondary
meaning
and
assume
inherent
distinctiveness,
but
also
assume
that
the
quality
that
makes
the
product
inherently
distinctive
is
functional.
protection
or
no
protection?
