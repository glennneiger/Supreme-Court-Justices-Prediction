hear
argument
next
in

99-150,
wal-mart
stores,
inc.--
mr.
coston.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
you
simply
challenge
a
judgment
under
rule
50,
even
though
you
made
no
objections
to
the
instructions,
that
brings
about
a
change...
that
brings
about
a
challenge
to
each
instruction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
another
way
of
avoiding
the
difficulty
is
to
say
don't
try
to
separate
them,
that
trade
dress...
that
trade...
the
product
and
trade
dress
go
the
same
way--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
that
two
pesos
would
regulate
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
consistent
with
two
pesos?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coston.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
haven't
taken
a
position.
just...
i
think
you've
answered
justice
kennedy.
you
come
in
here
and
say
we
should
adopt
these
factors
and
let
the
court
of
appeals
figure
out
what
they
mean.
well,
that's
just
too
easy
a
task.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
we're
going
to
say
these
are
the
controlling
factors,
we've
got
to
be
able
to
apply
them
to
this
case.
but
you
don't
give
us
any
hint
as
to
how
that
should
be
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
riback.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
riback.
mr.
coston,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coston.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
