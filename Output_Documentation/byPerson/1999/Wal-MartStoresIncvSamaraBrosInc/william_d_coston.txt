mr.
william
d.
coston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
legal
question
of
when
a
product
design
is
inherently
distinctive
under
the
lanham
act,
but
it
also
raises
the
more
practical
question
of
how
high
will
we
raise
a
trademark
barrier
to
competition.
the
affluent
consumer,
the
middle
class
consumer,
and
the
low
income
consumer
all
want
to
wear
clothes
that
are
popular
and
stylish.
here,
25
dollar
seersucker
dress
sold
under
the
samara
label
was
also
sold
with
a
noticeably
different
quality
by
wal-mart
for
3.88
dollars
under
different
labels,
cuties
by
judy
and
small
steps.
the
effect
of
the
court's
injunction
here
is
to
deny
consumers
the
opportunity
to
buy
any
seersucker
dress
with
appliques
which
may
or
may
not
be
found
in
the
collar.
because
of
the
tension
in
this
case
between
trademark
law
and
competition
law,
we
submit
there
is
a
need
for
a
new
standard
to
measure
when
trade
dress
and
product
configuration
is
inherently
distinctive.
mr.
william
d.
coston
well,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--in...
in
this
case,
we,
wal-mart,
contended
from
day
one
that
the
trade
dress
was
not
inherently
distinctive.
we've
never
waived
that
point.
mr.
william
d.
coston
the
case--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--under
instructions
that
we
suggest
do
not
properly
state
the
law.
mr.
william
d.
coston
they...
they
were
instruction
on
abercrombie--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--as
this
court
held
in
the
preponik
case,
justice
o'connor,
a
rule
50
challenge
to
a
judgment
is
tantamount
to
a
challenge
to
the
instructions.
and
in
that
case,
there
were
many
facts
very
similar
to
this
case.
a
changing
landscape
that...
and
i
use
the
word
landscape
pointedly.
mr.
william
d.
coston
no,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
coston
in
this
case
the
legal
landscape
of
the
protectability
of
trade
dress,
particularly
in
product
configuration,
has
been
shifting
since
two
pesos.
every
case
produces
a
different
result,
and
we
submit
that
it...
it
is
unfair
to
litigants
in
that
climate
to
have
to
predict
with
certainty
what
the
standard
would
be.
we
tried
at
the
district
court
level
and
the
second
circuit
level
to
confine
ourselves
to
second
circuit
law.
mr.
william
d.
coston
well,
we
submit,
justice
o'connor,
that
on
closer
inspection
of
the
statute,
that
congress
has
given
us
the
answer
to
that,
that
congress
has
said
for
product
configuration
trade
dress,
the
old-fashioned
rule
works
best.
go
to
secondary
meaning.
rather
than
trying
to
predict
how
a
consumer
will
view
a
new
product
design,
let's
wait
for
the
market
to
determine
if
that
design
has
earned
any--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--in
1946,
congress
adopted
section
23(c)
of
the
lanham
act,
which
lists,
among
a
whole
litany
of
possible
marks,
configuration
of
goods.
that's
the
only
spot
in
the
lanham
act
that
the
term
configuration
of
goods
is
found.
and
what
is
its
significance?
what--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
d.
coston
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
d.
coston
or...
or
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
second
circuit
for
that
evaluation.
we
also
believe
that
part
of
the
reason
the
importance
of
taking
a
case
like
this
is
given
the
different
standards
in
the
various
courts
of
appeals,
there
is
a
need
for
some
certainty
so
that
juries
can
be
properly
instructed.
and
that
is
what
we
submit
should
be
an
outcome
here,
that
this
jury
was
instructed
on
abercrombie.
it
was
instructed
on
partial
seabrook.
it
was
instructed
on
partial
knitwaves.
it
was
a
very
confusing
set
of
instructions
because,
we
submit,
the
law
was
very
confusing
at
that
time.
mr.
william
d.
coston
yes.
i...
i
submit
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
holding
of
two
pesos
was
simply
that
not
all
trade
dress
requires
proof
of
secondary
meaning.
the
court
allowed
the
possibility
that
some
trade
dress
might
require
secondary
meaning.
indeed,
this
court
in
the
qualitex
case
held
just
that,
that
color
as
a
form
of
trade
dress
always
requires
secondary
meaning.
we're
submitting
that
the
shape
of
a
product
is
like
color,
never
arbitrary,
never
inherently
distinctive,
but
always
requires
secondary
meaning.
mr.
william
d.
coston
i
submit,
justice
breyer,
that...
that
unless
it
had
bristles,
it
wouldn't
be--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--right.
if
it
has--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--the...
the
grape
brush
i
submit
says
nothing
to
the
consumer
about
source.
mr.
william
d.
coston
after
a
while.
mr.
william
d.
coston
well,
i...
i
agree--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--that
after
a
while
the
market
would
acknowledge
that
the
grape
hairbrush
came
from
a
certain
company,
but
that's
the
point
of
secondary
meaning,
that
it
has
to
show
to
the
consumer--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--well,
without
fighting
the
hypothetical,
my
assumption
would
be
that
there
would
be
some
packaging
that
would
accompany
it
and
probably
a
brand
name
that
no
one
would
launch
a
new
product
without
any
other
indicia
of
source.
mr.
william
d.
coston
i
think...
i
think
the
lower
courts
and
certainly
all
trademark
advocates
are
asking
this
court
to
clarify
two
pesos.
we
are
not
asking
that
you
overrule
it,
but
we
do
think
that...
that
23(c)
is
some
evidence
that
congress
felt
that
a
configuration
of
goods
was
different
than--
mr.
william
d.
coston
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsberg.
mr.
william
d.
coston
different
courts
have
interpreted
two
pesos
in
different
ways.
i
think
the
majority
view
is
that
two
pesos
was
more
of
a
packaging
case,
that
it
was
a
way
of
packaging
restaurant
services,
a
servicemark
if
you
will,
and
restaurant
food.
we
are
asking
you
to...
to
clarify
two
pesos
and
to
resolve
a
question
really
that
wasn't
resolved
in
that
case.
the
court
assumed,
without
deciding,
that
the
dress
was
inherently
distinctive.
it
was
stipulated
when
it
was
presented--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
to
non-product
configuration
trade
dress.
mr.
william
d.
coston
in
the
restaurant,
i
submit
it
was
a...
it
was
a
package.
mr.
william
d.
coston
i--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--i
agree,
justice
o'connor,
there
are
cases
at
the
margin
when
you're
not
sure
if
it's
a
package
or
a
product,
but
in
that
case
you
look
at
how
it's
being
presented
to
the
consumer.
if
the
principal
presentation
to
the
consumer
is
this
is
a
product,
then
secondary
meaning
would
be
required.
if
the
principal
presentation
is
don't
look
at
the
contents
here,
look
at
this
good
itself
as
a
package,
then
the
fact
finder
should
find
that
it's
a
package.
and
even
then
it
may
not
be
inherently
distinctive.
mr.
william
d.
coston
and--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--and,
mr.
chief
justice,
our
alternative
argument
does
just
that,
as
do
most
of
the
amicus
briefs.
they
say
let's
start
with
the
seabrook
test
to
determine
what
is
unique
trade
dress
with
no
distinction
between
packaging
and
product.
the...
the
distinction
we
offered
on
packaging
and
product
is
in
our
first
argument
as
representing
the
congressional
intent.
we
think
they
drew
the
line.
and
we
also
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
follow
the
abercrombie
tests,
which
are
word
descriptive
analysis
tests,
that
a
product
configuration
under
abercrombie
is
always
merely
descriptive--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--i
believe
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
two
pesos
certainly
went
through
an
abercrombie
analysis
and
used
the...
the
generic,
descriptive,
suggestive,
fanciful
classification--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--you
are
correct,
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
william
d.
coston
--i...
i
think
in
this
case...
and
we
argued
that
the...
the
appearance
of
this
good
was
merely
aesthetically
pleasing.
it
had
an
aesthetic
functionality.
now,
the...
whether
that
doctrine
exists
in
trademark
law
today
is
unclear.
mr.
william
d.
coston
well,
i
agree
completely
with
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
d.
coston
for
14
years
on
a
design
patent.
mr.
william
d.
coston
just
a
couple
of
observations,
justice
scalia.
the...
the
comment
you
made
that
our
first
argument
says
no
protection
for
product
configurations,
in
fact
we
do
allow
protection
for
product
configurations
on
proof
of
secondary
meaning.
and
i
think
you'll
find
in
the
patent
and
trademark
office
that
there
is
no
reported
decision
that
we
can
find
that
has
ever
allowed
an
inherently
distinctive
product
configuration,
but
there
are
many
cases
which
allow
a
product
configuration
to
serve
as
a
mark
on
proof
of
secondary
meaning.
with
respect
to
the
aesthetic
functionality
notion,
we
do
find
in
the
qualitex
case
some
notion
that
where
color
serves
a
function
of...
of
beauty,
that
no
one
has
the
right
to
take
that
away
from
the
marketplace
and...
and
prohibit
competition.
mr.
william
d.
coston
yes.
mr.
william
d.
coston
i
agree.
mr.
william
d.
coston
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
d.
coston
i
think
not,
justice
souter.
if
we
keep
in
mind
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act
is
to
protect
consumers
against
confusion
when
they
buy
one
good
or
another,
and
if
there
isn't
that
consumer
protection
notion
in
a
choice
between
one
thing
of
beauty
and
another,
if
they
don't
care
who
made
it,
but
they
buy
it
because
it's
beautiful,
then
the
lanham
act
isn't
even
implicated.
if
i
could
reserve
a
few
moments,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
d.
coston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
problem
with
an
inherently
distinctive
test
is...
is
that
it
is
predictive.
it
attempts
to
determine
in
advance
of
the
demonstration
of
secondary
meaning
what
consumers
would
think,
and
we
know
from
product
configurations
alone
that
they
do
not
tell
people
source-indicating
facts.
rather,
they
tell
consumers
i'm
a
product.
it
inherently
describes
the
product.
in
this
case,
application
of
a
secondary
meaning
rule
would
work
no
harm.
samara
had
had
its
products
in
the
market
for
5
or
6
years,
the
record
evidence
indicates.
and
what
we're
seeing
with
the
amicus
briefs
proposing
a
very
rigorous
seabrook
test
is
that
the
same
evidentiary
burden
is
going
to
be
put
on
mark
owners,
albeit
it
calling
it
a
seabrook
burden,
as
has
been
done
in
the
past
with
the
secondary
meaning
test.
but
the
patent
and
trademark
office
has
followed
the
secondary
meaning
test
for
many,
many
years.
they've
got
it
down
to
a
science.
trademark
practitioners
know
how
to
do
it.
we
submit
that's
the
right
outcome
here,
that
for
product
configurations,
require
secondary
meaning.
thank
you.
