justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
were
rather
lengthy
instructions
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
i
think
if
i
were
a
juror
reading
them,
i'd
be
a
little
confused.
but
there...
apparently
wal-mart
didn't
object
to
those
instructions,
and
we're
not
here
being
asked
to
find
that
the
instructions
that
were
given
were
faulty.
and
so,
it's...
it's...
i
don't
think
that
the
test
that
you
propose
would
necessarily
fit
within
the
instructions
that
were
given,
and
yet
that's
what
went
to
the
jury.
and
i
wonder
if
we...
we
don't
just
say,
well,
okay--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--let
it
stand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
but
you
submitted
that
question
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury,
for
whatever
reason,
has
come
back
thinking
it
was
inherently
distinct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
how
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--came
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you
didn't
preserve
any
objection
on
that.
we're
not
up
here
arguing
about
the
validity
of
the
instructions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just...
it's
hard
to
know
how
to
define
inherently
distinctive.
it's...
it's
sort
of
like
pornography:
i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
how...
how
are
we
supposed
to
define
that
term?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where...
where
did
congress
say
that
we
had
to
find
that
secondary--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
court
in
that
two
pesos
case
basically
said
that
we
don't
apply
to
a
trade
dress
claim
a
general
requirement
of
secondary
meaning.
i...
i
thought
we
crossed
that
bridge.
and
yet,
you're
here
arguing
that
we
have
to
go
back
and
change
that.
i
think
your
position
would
require
us
to
basically
review
and...
and
reverse
two
pesos.
that
was
a
trade
dress
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
very--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
very
difficult,
frankly,
to
know
whether
it's
product
packaging
or
product
configuration
in
many
cases.
which
was
it
in
the
restaurant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not
all
that
clear,
and
i
think
there
are
many
cases
where
it
wouldn't
be
clear.
it
sounds
like...
you...
you
know,
you
can
say
the
words,
but
i
think
they
blur
at
the
margins--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
knowing
which
is
which.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
how
it
would
apply
in
this
very
case,
however.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
clarifying.
how
do
you
trace
it
down
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
look
at
that
thing
and
it
looks
pretty
amorphous
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
if--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
jury
shouldn't
take
into
consideration,
should
it,
in
deciding
this
case
that
there
was
an
intentional
copying?
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
the
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would...
could...
could
wal-mart
have
protected
itself
here
by
hanging
a
tag
on
every
dress
saying
this
is
not
a
samara
dress?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
wal-mart
dress.
