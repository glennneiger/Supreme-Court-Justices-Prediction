mr.
stuart
m.
riback
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
terms
of
the
legal
standard
that
we're
advocating,
we
have
no
substantive
disagreement
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
its
brief
about
what
must
be
shown
to
establish
that
a
product's
design
is
inherently
distinctive
under
the
lanham
act.
in
the
context
of
product
design,
seabrook
gives
concrete
definition
to
the
abercrombie
standard
that
this
court
endorsed
in
two
pesos,
carried
forward
in
qualitex.
in
other
words,
something
that
is
commonly
used
on
a
product
is
associated
with
the
product
and
thus
descriptive,
and
something
that
is
unique
and
unusual
is
not
and,
therefore,
is
inherently
distinctive.
abercrombie,
as
focused
by
seabrook,
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents
in
two
pesos
and
qualitex.
it
is
consistent
with
practice
in
the
patent
and
trademark
office.
it
is
consistent
with
how
most
circuits,
irrespective
of
how
they
articulate
their
legal
standard,
in
actual
practice
have
been
ruling
on
these
cases.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
no,
seabrook
i
believe
asks
some
concrete
questions
that
enable
you
to
give
content
to
the
question
of
how
inherently
distinctive
something
is.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
that's
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
right.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
if
i...
if
i
may,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
something
that
you
said
was
inaccurate,
which
is
if
you're
trying
to
draw
customers
based
on
the
shape,
then
that
is
an
indicator
of
source.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
because
there's
nothing
in
the
lanham
act
that
tells
you
that
the
same
feature
of
a
product
can't
serve
more
than
one
purpose.
you
don't
want--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--well,
there's
a
number
of
problems
with
that,
if
i
may.
i
think
what's
been
coming
out
in
the
lower
courts,
in
terms
of
the
advocating
a
separate
test
for
product
design
or
saying
the
product
design
should
more
likely
have
secondary
meaning,
is
two
things.
one
is
this
concern
that
was
stated
about
protecting
the
item
itself.
the
item
itself
is
not
what's
being
protected.
if
the
item
itself
is
what
was
being
protected,
we'd
be
running
into
the
functionality
doctrine.
and
i
think
this
addresses
justice
scalia's
point.
what
the
functionality
doctrine
says
is
if
you
need
something
in
order
to
compete,
if
there's
something
about
the
particular
mark
that's
being
claimed
that
is
necessary
so
that
competitors
won't
be
foreclosed,
then
that
feature
is
functional,
and
if
that
feature
is
functional,
it
makes
no
difference
if
it's
inherently
distinctive.
you
can't
lock
it
up.
that's
how
functionality
shows
up.
but
that
means
that
then
the
item
itself
is
what's
being
protected.
we're
not
talking
about
that
here.
we're
talking
about
non-functional
arrangements
of
features
that
give
the
product
the
appearance
it
has.
this
is
something
that
judge
motz
in
the
ashley
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out.
it
is
not
the
product
itself.
the
other--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--aesthetics
can
be
functional--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--of
course,
and
you
wouldn't
want
to
force
someone
who
wants
to
use
the
design
of
the
dress
to
indicate
its
source
to
make
it
ugly
in
order
to
get
it
to
be
source
indicated.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
so,
there's
no
necessary
tension
there.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
unless
it
is
so
unique
and
unusual
that
the
customer
would
be
warranted
in
inferring
source.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
i
think...
i
think
what
you
might
be
getting
at,
justice
scalia,
is
the
concern
that
people
don't
tend
to
perceive
a
product
design
to
be
a
source
indicator
as
readily
as
they
might
perceive
a
package.
okay.
and
that
might
be
true.
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
seen
a
study.
it
may
well
be
correct.
but
if
it's
true,
that
doesn't
mean
the
test
is
different.
what
it
means
is
if
you
apply
the
right
test,
you're
going
to
get
more
negative
answers
on
product
design
cases.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
yes.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
first
of
all,
i
would
say
if
we
follow
the
court's
precedent
in
two
pesos,
that
forecloses
that
because
two
pesos
says
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
lanham
act
says
you
do
not
need
to
do
is
require
secondary
meaning
of
someone
who
has
an
inherently
distinctive
trade
dress.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
yes.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
i
think
that--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--i
think
the
harm
is
this.
you
can
go
in
today
on
january
19th,
2000
into
a
store
with
certain
perceptions
about
what
is
and
is
not
likely
to
be
used
by
consumers
to
identify
products.
that's
a
secondary
meaning
argument.
but
you...
you
can
use
january
19,
2000
as
your
baseline.
i
don't
know
a
month
from
now,
a
year
from
now,
10
years
from
now,
what
sort
of
products
will
be
there,
what
sort
of
innovative
methods
of
differentiating
one
product
from
another
there
will
be,
or--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--that
would
get
rid
of
inherent
distinctiveness
altogether.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure,
in
addition
to
that,
that
there
is
any
principled
way
in
which
you
could
distinguish
packaging
from
secondary
meaning.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
you're
opening
up
another--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--you're
opening
up
another
thicket
with
that.
yes.
i'm
sorry.
what?
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
i
think
in
two
pesos
it
would
depend
on
whether
you
think
the
restaurant
was
serving
food
or
serving
a
dining
experience.
if
the
restaurant
is
serving
food,
then
it's
a
package.
if
it's
serving
a
dining
experience,
then
the
ambiance
and
the
layout
are
part
of
it.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
and
it's
a
product
design
case.
and
i
think
restaurants
do
serve...
do
serve
you
with
a
dining
experience.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
i--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--i
don't
think
the
opinion
bears
that
out
because
what
the
opinion
talks
about,
if
you
look
at
two
pesos,
when
they
have
the
discussion
of
section
2,
it
talks
about
if
a
verbal
or
symbolic
mark
or
the
features
of
a
product
design
may
be
registered
under
section
2.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
two
pesos
is
addressed
toward
product
design
very
heavily
is
because
when
you
look
at
the
four
second
circuit
cases
that
were
disapproved
in
the
two
pesos
case,
every
last
one
of
those
is
a
product
design
case.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
every
one
of
the
product
design
cases
that
was
addressed
there
would
necessarily
be
inherently
distinctive,
but
two
pesos
says
that
you
cannot
exclude
that
possibility.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
i...
i'm
not
sure
that's
exactly
right
because
the
entire
thrust
of
two
pesos
is
that...
first
of
all,
it
never
mentions
the
word
package
i
don't
believe,
other
than
in
one
of
the
concurrences.
but--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--well,
that
only
presumes
that
the
product
itself
is
what's
being
protected.
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
talking
about
something
that
isn't
necessarily
part
of
the
product
where
the
product
would
still
be
the
product
even
if
you
stripped
the
feature
off,
which
would
be
certainly
the
case
with
what's
at
issue
in
this
case.
you
could
strip
the
features
off.
you
could...
the
product
would
still
be
the
product,
and
you
could
then
put
those
features
onto
something
else.
obviously,
it
would
have
to
be
made
out
of
cloth,
but
you
could
use
it
for
a
curtain.
you
could
use
it,
you
know,
for
a
drape
or
a
bedspread.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
oh,
sure.
something
like
that
happened
at
the
trial
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
that...
well,
actually
that
happened
at
the
trial.
at
the
trial,
i
took
the
collar
of
a
dress,
folded
it
up
into
the
dress,
and
asked
the
wal-mart
witness
if
she
would
buy
it
for
wal-mart
to
put
out
on
its
shelves
and
sell
and
she
said,
absolutely,
it's
very
cute.
so,
the
record
in
this
case
absolutely
supports
that.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
no,
it's...
it's
a
preliminary
question
now
by
statute.
it
used
to--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--yes.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
that's
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
right.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
i...
i
think
what
the
question...
i
think
what
you're
gliding
past
in
the
question
is
what
we're
trying
to
ascertain
here
is
inherent
distinctiveness.
think
of
what
those
words
mean.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
it
has
to
be
inherent
in
the
product
and
it
has
to
distinguish
it
from
others.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
it's...
the...
the
presumption
under
the
lanham
act
and
the
case
law,
including
out
of
this
court,
is
that
if
it's
inherently
distinctive,
then
it
indicates
source.
that's
the
presumption.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
you
got
to
ask
the
other
questions
in
seabrook
then
if
that's
the
case.
there's
no
exclusion
in
the
lanham
act
for
clothing.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
so,
there's
certainly--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--no,
i
don't
think
so
because
all
of
the
formulations
that
i've
seen
about
what
might
be
added
all
require
measures
of
consumer
perception
which
in
and
of
itself
are
secondary
meaning
tests.
so,
if
you
concede
that
you
don't
want
to
calcify
the
law
by
freezing
current
conceptions
into
place,
and
allow
for
development
of
the
marketplace
in
the
future
with
new
products
and
new
ways
of
differentiating
them,
then
you
have
to
maintain
that
there
can
be
inherently
distinctive
anything.
the
question
is
how
you
ascertain
it.
seabrook
doesn't
ask
just
is
it
unique
and
unusual.
it
also
follows
a
couple
of
other...
another
couple
of
questions
down
the
line.
is
it
merely
a
refinement
of
what's
out
there,
even
if
it
is
somewhat
different?
is
it
a
commonly
used
shape?
it
adds
more
than
just
saying
is
it
different.
what
it
does
is
it
gives
content
to
the
analysis
by
saying
something
will
be
descriptive
for
purposes
of
the
usual
abercrombie
analysis.
something
will
be
descriptive
if
it's
very
common
because
ordinarily
a
feature
of
a
product
wouldn't
have
descriptive
or
suggestive
capability.
you
would
need
to
give
content
to
that
in
this
context,
and
i
think
seabrook
does
that
if
you
follow
those
questions
down.
but
you
would
need
to
follow
all
of
it.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
there
was
extensive
evidence
on
that
at
the
trial.
there
were...
and
i'm
sure
you've
noticed
in
the
joint
appendix...
dozens
of
garments
that
were
submitted.
there
was
evidence
submitted
on
what
samara
is
trying
to
accomplish
by
using
this
particular
look.
in
terms
of
seabrook,
you
line
up
the
samara
dresses
against
what
else
was
there,
they're
noticeably
and
markedly
different.
and
given
that--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
well,
two
things
i'd
like
to
say
about
that.
first
of
all,
judge
newman's
dissent
forgot
one
point,
which
is
we're
not
saying
that
using
a
collar
on
clothing
is
inherently
distinctive.
that
would
be
silly.
we're
not
saying
using
appliques
on
clothing
is
inherently
distinctive.
that's
almost
as
silly.
what
we
are
saying
is
not
that
any
particular
one
of
these
features
is
unique
and
unusual,
but
the
particular
combination
that
is
used
is
different
from
what
is
out
there
in
the
rest
of
the
market
and
serves
to
indicate
source
as
a
result.
in
terms
of
the
simplicity
pattern,
that's
a
function
of
reduced
copying
and
basically
just
not
looking
at
what
the
record
said
about
it.
in
terms
of
the
simplicity
pattern,
that
was
not
a
collar
where
the
applique
was
made
into
the
collar.
that
was
just
something
printed
right
onto
the
face
of
the
dress,
and
the
testimony
in
the
trial
brings
that
out.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
no.
he
also
has
to
use
it
in
commerce.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
right?
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
so...
so,
in
and
of
itself,
the
commercial
use
distinguishes
it
somewhat
from
the
other...
from
the
other
instances
that
you
made.
but
the
other
thing
is
there
isn't
one
single
standard
of
beauty
and
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
make
things
beautiful.
one
of
the
things
that
both
wal-mart
and
samara
agreed
on
at
the
trial
is
that
there
is
virtually
infinite
number
of
ways
to
make
pretty
or
attractive,
saleable
children's
clothing.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
the
purpose--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--because
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act
is
twofold.
it's,
number
one,
to
give
consumers
information
so
that
when
they
see
something,
they
recognize
it.
and
number
two,
it's
to
protect
producers,
who
come
up
with
a
way
to
differentiate
their
products,
in
their
efforts
to
promote
it
and
to
protect
their
investment--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--if
i
may,
i
think
a
design
patent
will
look
somewhere
else.
with
a
design
patent,
you're
talking
about
novelty
and
non-obviousness.
unique
and
unusual
isn't
necessarily
novel.
it's
a
different
concept.
with
design
patents,
you
want
to
promote
creativity.
you
want
to
promote
something
new,
not
necessarily
in
the
lanham
act.
with
the
lanham
act,
it's
simply
the
ability
of
whatever
it
is
that
you're
using
as
the
signifier
to
signify
what's
been--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--what's
been
signified.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
yes.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
there's...
there's
some
overlap
of
subject
matter.
i
think
the
way
the
case
law
has
shaken
out
almost
unanimously
in
the
lower
courts
has
been
that,
although
some
of
the
same
subject
matter
can
be
covered
by
both
the
design
patent
law
and
the
lanham
act,
they
are
basically
different
inquiries,
serving
different...
the
statutes
serve
different
functions,
and
aim
at
different
things.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
yes.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
in
terms
of
infringement?
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
in...
in
terms
of
infringement,
i
think
the
answer
probably
would
be
yes.
the
answer...
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
in
terms
of
the
consequences,
i
think
the
answer
would
be
no.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
insofar
as
inherent
distinctiveness--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--insofar
as
inherent
distinctiveness
is
concerned,
i
think
that's
probably
right.
insofar
as
secondary
meaning
is
concerned,
no.
intentional
copying
is
an
indicator
of
secondary
meaning.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
no,
it's
not...
it's
not
irrelevant,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
do
have
an
infringement
with
intent
and
don't
have
an
infringement
without
it,
which...
which
is
what
i
understood
that
question
to
be.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
no,
it
could
not
have
for
the
same
reason--
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
--it
could
not
have,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
same
reason
that
taco
cabana,
by
printing
its
name
on
its
menus
and
putting
a
big
sign
on
a
pylon
outside,
couldn't
have
saved
itself
from
infringing
on
two
pesos'
mark.
or
i
have
that
backwards.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
no
protection.
if
it's
functional...
if...
if
it
is
functional,
then
under
every
authority
that
i'm
aware
of,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
inherently
distinctive
or
not.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
there
could
be
lanham
act
protection.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
no.
i
say
that
it
can
be
a
lanham
act
violation.
you
would
need
to
go
through
the
analysis
prescribed
under
seabrook
and
abercrombie
in
order
to
ascertain
where
this
comes
out
in
the
lanham
act
analysis.
and
then
at
a
certain
point,
you
may
well
be
able
to
say
that
this
is
lanham
act
protected.
i'm
not
saying
it
necessarily
would
be.
mr.
stuart
m.
riback
if
you
can
design
around
it...
and
this
is...
this
is
basically
what
the
predecessor
of
the
federal
circuit...
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
said.
if
you
can
design
around
it,
if
you
need
it
in
order
to
compete,
then
it's
functional.
but
if
you...
i'm
sorry.
if
you
cannot
design
around
it,
if
you
need
it
in
order
to
compete,
then
it's
functional.
but
if
you
can
design
around
it,
if
there's
no
reason
for
you
to
use
specifically
that,
then
it's
not
functional.
there's
a
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
explains
how
the
aesthetic
functionality
works,
which
is
a
cookbook
case
decided
by
judge
posner,
where
he
said,
look,
you
want
to
have
a
cookbook
big
so
that
it
opens
up
so
you
can
read
it.
you
want
to
have
big
pictures
and
big
print
so
you
can
read
it
while
you're
working
at
a
counter.
so,
of
course,
you're
going
to
end
up
with
a
picture...
you're
going
to
end
up
with
a
cookbook
with
big
pictures
and
print,
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
pictures
from
bleeding
out
onto
the
edges,
you're
going
to
have
gold...
gold
edging.
so,
of
course,
the
cookbooks
are
going
to
look
alike.
well,
that's
aesthetic
functionality,
but
that's
not
what's
involved
in
this
case.
this
case
is
quite
different.
if
i
might
go
on.
there
hasn't
been
any
contention
here
that
the
jury
wasn't
appropriately
instructed.
the
district
judge
specifically
mentioned
seabrook
by
name
in
his
analysis
in
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
opinion.
the
second
circuit
said,
among
other
things...
it
said
a
lot
of
things
that
it
didn't
need
to
in
our
view,
but
one
of
the
things
that
it
said
was
the
task
of
the
court
is
to
evaluate
how
unique
and
unexpected
the
claimed
trade
dress
is.
it
also
said
that
the
jury
looked
at
the
dozens
of
garments
before
it.
it
said
that
at
least
two
or
three
times.
in
making
that
analysis,
i
submit
that
if
you
do
apply
the
seabrook
test,
you
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
an
affirmance
is
necessary
in
this
case.
if
there
aren't
any
other
questions,
i'll
conclude.
