justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
third?
that
is,
as
i
understand
this,
you
have
bank
robbery,
and
that
involves
taking
money
from
a
bank
through
force
or
violence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
have
larceny,
which
involves
taking
money
from
a
bank.
i
forgot
force
and
violence.
that
doesn't
exist.
it
looks
identical
but
for
the
force
or
violence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
my
problem,
i
guess
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
is
i
happen
to
leave
out
one
phrase.
it
says
in
the...
in
the
larceny
one,
which
it
doesn't
say
in
the
bank
one,
with
intent
to
steal.
all
right.
so,
their
basic
argument...
i
think
it's
their
best
argument.
maybe
they
have
a
disagreement.
but
they
say
that...
that
with
intent
to
steal
means
there's
something
about
larceny
that
isn't
true
of
bank
robbery,
and
so
it
isn't
true
that
bank
larceny
is
just
three
of
the
four
things
of
robbery.
it
is
three
plus.
it
is
three
plus
the
intent
to
steal.
now,
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
your
answer
to
my
question
was
what
justice
souter
just
said,
but
i'm
not
sure.
the...
the...
i'm
back
to...
to
the
fact
that
there...
these
words
do
appear
in
the
larceny
statute,
whoever
has...
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin.
they
are
there,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
they're
not
in
the
bank
robbery
statute,
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not,
not.
but
your
point
was
that
that's
always
implied.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
this
is
the
case
that
i
think
tests
it.
it's
a
little
hard
and
it's
rather
absurd.
but
i
suppose
that
if
i
went
into
a
bank
and
i
took
some
money
from
the
bank
and
i
thought
it
was
mine,
i
wouldn't
have
an
intent
to
steal.
i
was
wrong.
it
wasn't
mine.
it
was
the
bank's,
and
so
i
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
larceny.
now
suppose
i
got
so
angry
at
the
bank
because
the
automatic
teller
wasn't
working.
you
know,
i
had
been
frustrated,
and
i
got
so
angry
i
got
a
gun.
i
wouldn't
ever
do
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
went
to
the
teller.
i
pointed
the
gun
at
it
and
said
give
me
that
$200
thinking
it
was
mine
and,
lo
and
behold,
it
was
the
teller's.
would
i
be
guilty
of
bank
robbery?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
there
is
no
intent
to
steal
because
i
thought
the
money
was
mine.
you
see,
that...
that's
what
they're
saying...
that's
what
they're
saying
the
difference
is.
they're
saying
that
the
difference
is
that
if
i
think
the
money
is
mine,
i
get
off
under
the
bank
larceny
statute,
but
if
i
think
the
money
is
mine,
i
don't
get
off
under
the
bank
robbery
statute.
is
that...
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
it
may
be
so
absurd,
this
case,
it
may
never
have
happened
and
i
don't
know
that
we
should
turn
a
serious
opinion
on
something
that's
never
happened
in
the
history
of
the
world.
i
mean,
i
think
sophia
loren
once
got
a
hatchet
and
chopped
apart
a
coke
machine
because
she
was
so
angry
at
it.
so,
i...
i
guess
that
it's
possible
it
could
happen.
but
am
i
right
in
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you
would...
it
requires
an
intent
to
steal.
so,
you're
saying
my
angry...
my
angry,
revenge-driven
customer
who
tries
to
steal
his
own
money
and
fails
is
or
is
not
guilty
of
robbery?
is
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
if
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
actually
a
bad
example,
but
i'm
just...
it
does
illustrate
that
my
great
difficulty
in
finding
an
instance
where
this
intent
to
steal
could
make
a
difference.
i
mean,
can
you
think
of
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
the
tenth
circuit
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
can
you
remind
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
what
we
really
want
to
know
is
the
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
i...
i
was
trying
to
think
of
the
actual
concrete
example.
what
i've
had
a
very,
very
hard
time
thinking
of
is
thinking
of
an
example
where
a
person
commits
bank
robbery
but
he
doesn't
intend
to
steal
the
money.
i
did
try
to
give
one
before,
and
i
don't
think
actually
it
was
a
very
good
one.
you
know
have
the
example
of
a
person
commits
robbery
because
he
wants
to
go
to
prison.
but
justice
scalia
just
said
in
that
case
he's
committed
robbery
to
go
to
prison.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
i...
i
don't
know
why
that's
a
good
example.
and...
and
so,
can
anybody
think
of
a
real
example
where
a
person
commits
bank
robbery
but
he
doesn't
have
an
intent
to
steal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
given...
that...
that's
basically...
you're
now
right
at
the
point
of
where
my
real
question
is
because
i...
the...
the
serious
question
is
this,
that
i
imagine
it's
possible...
we
were
thinking
of
facts
of
the
thomas
crowne
affair.
you
know,
it's
possible
to
work
out
a
law
school
hypothetical
where
a
person
would,
in
fact,
maybe
be
guilty
of
robbery
although
he
didn't
intend
permanently
to
deprive
the
bank
of
the
property.
it's
conceivable.
and
that
person
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
larceny.
and
so,
you
know,
because
he
didn't
use
force,
but
he...
he
didn't
intend
permanently,
so
he
didn't
steal.
i
could
imagine
such
a
thing,
though
it's...
obviously
we're
having
a
hard
time
finding
one.
all
right.
should
lesser
included
offense
law
turn
on
that
kind
of
law
school
hypothetical?
i
mean,
if
in
fact
judges
who
are
busy
and
criminal
lawyers
who
are
not
experts
in
weird
hypotheticals
as...
you
know...
which...
and
they
have
to
manage
a
system,
is
it
the
case
that
if
it's...
why
is
it?
if
it's
so
hard
for
us
to
find
even
a
hypothetical,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
this?
that
the
u.s.
code
is
written
with
provisions
at
many
different
times.
the
words
are
not
identical.
they
don't
track
different
things
perfectly,
and
if
you
have
to
have
a
manageable
system,
there
should
be
a
real
difference,
not
a
difference
that
turns
on
some
obscure
ability
to
think
of...
of
a
set
of
cases
that
perhaps
never
occurs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
precisely
my
point.
we
found
a
movie
that
contains
your
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
the
sentencing
commission...
as
a
sentencing
commission,
i
had...
we
had
many
thousands
of
cases,
and
i'll
have
to
say
i
never
recalled
such
a
case.
and
so,
my
real
because
is
if
it's
so
hard
for
us
to
find
such
an
example,
should
we
turn
lesser
included
offense
law
upon
that.
that's
my
actual
question.
i'd
like
your
view
about
that.
