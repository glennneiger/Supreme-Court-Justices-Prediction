we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
99-5716,
floyd
carter
v.
united
states.
mr.
mccauley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
the
government
contests
you
on
that
point,
mr.
mccauley.
i
think
that
what
they
rely
on
is
a
case
like
bell
against
the
united
states,
which
says
that
the
bank
robbery
statute
was...
was
deliberately
altered
so
as
not
to
be
a
common
law
and...
and
its
successor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
make...
how
do
you
distinguish
or
how
do
you
treat
the
bell
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right,
mr.
mccauley,
why
didn't
they
change
the
other
statute
too?
because
one
now
says
with
intent
to
steal,
the
other
doesn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
morissette
is
totally
different
from
this
case,
it
seems
to
me.
there
there
was
no
intent
requirement,
and
the
court
said
because
at
common
law
there
was
one,
we're
going
to
read
it
in
here.
here
you
have
very
specific
elements
that
weren't
present
in
morissette
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
a
criminal
statute
is
going
to
be...
if...
if
it's
silent
as
to
intent,
there's
going
to
be
some
mens
rea
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
that's
quite
different
from
the
situation
here
where
the
elements
have
been
quite...
quite
specifically
specified
and
one...
one
substantially
differs
from
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
case
that
uses
the
word
scintilla
in
that
context?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
a
case
from
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mccauley.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frederick,
you
said
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
was
a
question
before
that.
now,
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
mccauley,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccauley.
the
case
is
submitted.
