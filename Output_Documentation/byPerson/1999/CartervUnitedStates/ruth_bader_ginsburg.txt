justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
before
we
get
to
the
clarification,
you're
saying
the
word
feloniously...
that
did
it.
not
the
words
of
the
bank
larceny
statute,
intent
to
steal,
but
feloniously
takes
was
adequate
because
that's
what
at
common
law
described--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
a
part
of
a
wholesale
cleanup
operation.
they
weren't
saying
it's
confusing
in
this
robbery
statute.
they
took
out
all
the
words
in
many
statutes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccauley,
this...
this
same
question
was
asked
of
you
as
a
prior
argument.
and
i...
there...
there
was
another
hypothetical
that
you
were...
one
was
i
think
it's
my
money.
the
other
was
i
just
want
to
see
how
nimble
i
am,
so
i'm
going
to
get
the
money.
i'm
going
to
rob
the
bank.
then
i'm
going
walk
around
the
block
and
give
it
right
back
to
them.
that
was
the
other
hypothetical.
no
intent
to
steal
in
either
case.
one,
i
think
it's
my
money;
the
other,
i'm
going
to
walk
around
the
block
with
it.
in...
in
all
of
the
annals
of
criminal
law,
i
don't
know
that
either
of
those
situations
have
ever
come
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
i...
i'm
wondering
whether
there
is
a
case
where
it
would
be
real
and
not
just
hypothetical.
but
there's
another
aspect
of
this
case
that...
that
may
also
fall
in
the
academic
category.
that
is,
didn't
one
of
the...
didn't
the
government
urge
that
in
this
case
there's
no
way
that
this
could
be
anything
other
than
robbery?
that
it
could
not
have
been
larceny
so
that
whatever
we
answered
this
question,
it
wouldn't
matter
because
in
this
case
you
could
not...
you
didn't...
it
could
not
have
been
larceny.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
it
was
the
government's
position
that
no
rational
jury...
juror
could
so
find,
so
you
couldn't
submit
it
to
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
problem
with
that
argument
is
do
you...
do
you
consider
that
until
the
word
feloniously
was
taken
out,
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ah,
so
what
was
the
law
pre-1948?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
before
1948,
if
on
a
bank
robbery
indictment,
which
did
not
include
also
a
count
of
bank
larceny,
counsel
for
the
defense
had
said,
judge,
i
would
like
you
to
give
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
pre-1948.
the...
the
proper
answer
for
the
judge
would
have
been,
no,
it's
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do...
do
you
know
what
was
the
department
of
justice's
practice
before
1948?
did
they
object
to
giving
the
bank
larceny
charge
as
a
lesser
included
offense
on
the
theory
that
the
word
feloniously
wasn't
enough
to
do
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
tell
me
about
those
three
others
because
one
of
his
points
was,
it
was
a...
i
did...
i
did
the
job
the
same
way.
one
time
i
got
indicted
for
robbery,
those
other
three
times
for
bank
larceny
and
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
so,
it's
got
to
be
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
it
still
the
rule?
isn't
it
still
the
rule
in
england
even
to
this
day,
that
larceny
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of...
of
robbery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
go
both
ways
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
aren't
there
a
number
of
states
that
have
holdings
that
bank
larceny
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
bank
robbery?
i
thought
there
were
a
number
of
states
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
wouldn't...
i
don't
know
why
a
state
court
would
be
interpreting
21...
they
wouldn't
have
the
prosecution
for
that,
so
it
would
have
to
be
their
own
statutes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
what
is
the
incidence
of...
of
state
prosecutions
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
1948
is
the
felonious.
but
you
told
me
that...
nothing
turned
on
that.
i...
i
had
thought
that
up
until
'48,
bank
robbery
meant
intent
to
steal.
and
you
told
me
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
because
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
carrying
away...
i
think
the
last
time
you
were
before
us
you
did
say,
well,
he
didn't
even
have
to
make
it
to
the
door
of
the
bank
to
carry
it
away
for
purposes
of
bank
larceny.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
the
same
offense
at
least...
well,
let
me
ask
you
it
this
way.
indictment
for
a
bank
robbery.
acquittal
because
the
evidence
of
force
or
intimidation
is
equivocal,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
or
at
least
as
the
defendant
alleges.
could
the
government
then
re-indict
for
bank
larceny?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i...
i
wanted
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
that
was
a
consequence
of
the
argument
that
you
are
making
today,
that
the
government
would
have
two
bites
by
doing
this.
it
could...
it
could
indict
just
for
robbery.
if
it
loses
on
that,
it
could
come
back
with
a
bank
larceny.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
you
are...
you
are
saying
that.
that's
the
discretion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
the...
under
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
made
this...
took
out
the
word
feloniously,
which
appeared
to
be,
from
what
the
reviser
said,
part
of
this
cleaning
up,
taking
out
the
felony
misdemeanor.
there
isn't
anything
that
indicates...
you...
you
said
it
might
be
this
and
it
might...
but
there's
nothing
in...
in
removing
that
word
feloniously
that
we
have
to
go
on
other
than
the...
the
reviser's
note,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
an
argument
that
we
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improperly
granted
because
it
doesn't
raise
the
question
that
you
have
been
arguing
up
until
now.
