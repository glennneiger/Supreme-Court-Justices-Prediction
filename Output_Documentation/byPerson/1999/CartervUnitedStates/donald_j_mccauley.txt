mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
bank
larceny
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
federal
bank
robbery.
both
offenses
draw
their
language
and
history
and
understanding
from
centuries
of
common
law
under
which
larceny
has
always
been
understood
to
mean
a
lesser
offense
of
robbery.
at
common
law,
robbery
was
defined
as
an
aggravated
larceny
or
as
a
compound
larceny,
all
of
the
elements
of
the
larceny
subsumed
and
embraced
by
the
robbery.
the
robbery...
it
was
defined
as
an
aggravated
larceny
because
it
had
an
extra
element.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i
don't
believe...
the
prince
case
reveals
that
there
was
not
an
altering
of
the
common
law.
the
prince
case
i...
i
think
is
the
precedent
here
regarding
the
understanding
of
the
1948
recodification
and
explains...
there
are
two
things
i
think
the
prince
case
explained.
it
explained
that
the
recodification
in
1948
was
a
change
in
phraseology,
a
tidying
up
of
the
entire
criminal
code.
it
was
not
a
rewriting
and
redefining
of
crimes.
and
what's
significant,
it
interpreted
another
provision
within
2113,
the
unlawful
entry.
and
it
said...
and
it
emphasized
right
in
its
opinion...
it
was
manifestly
the
purpose
of
congress
to
establish
lesser
offenses.
the
prince
case
said
the
heart
of
the
offense
is
the
intent
to
steal.
it
was...
that
language
was
emphasized.
the
intent
to
steal
on
the
unlawful
entry
provision.
then
the
unlawful
entry
provision
merges
into
the
robbery
provision.
so,
the
robbery
provision
had
to
have
an
intent
to
steal.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
bell
case
doesn't...
it's
not
changing
the
common
law
understanding.
it's
not
interpreting
a
statute
where
this
court
said
when
interpreting
a
statute
that
is
codified
a
traditional
common
law
offense,
we're
going
to
understand
all
of
the
elements
at
common
law
for
that
particular
offense.
that
long
history
and
tradition
is
not
going
to
be
eviscerated
or
revolutionized
if...
or...
i
think
the
language
in
the
morissette
opinion...
if
there
was
a
mere
deletion
of
a
term.
and
that's
what
we
have
here
in
1948,
the
mere
deletion
of
the
term--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes,
your
honor.
we
do
not
quibble
with
the
schmuck
standard.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
well,
if
i
may
address
the
monetary
value
problem
first,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
a
monetary
element
in
the
robbery
provision.
you
must
take
the
money
or
the
property.
the
value
is
the
universe
of
value...
the
universe
of
money,
of
which
$1,000
is
embraced.
so,
that
is
not
an
element.
and
even
if
it
is
an
element,
it
is
embraced.
the
reason
i
say
it's
not
an
element
is
i
refer
the
court
to
the
reviser's
notes
and
congress
in
the
reviser's
notes,
when
it
changed
the
threshold
from
$100
to
$1,000,
specifically
stated
that
this
change
goes
to
punishment.
however,
should
the
court
interpret
it
as
an
element--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--then
it
is...
then
it
is
embraced
in
the
robbery
provision's
requirement
of
money...
a
money
requirement.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
show
that
the
elements
are
a
subset
of
the
greater,
and
i
believe
the
money
requirement
in
the
greater
offense
embraced
whether
it's
$1,000,
whether
it's
$100,
whether
it's
above
$100--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
$1,000
i
submit
is
within
the
universe
of
the
monetary
element
of
robbery.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no,
you
do
not.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
and
both
of
them
are
within
that,
yes,
your
honor.
and
my--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--my
client
has
never
been
on
a
yacht.
he's
been
in
a
bank
and--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
lesser
offense
of
larceny,
as
that
term
is
understood,
a
conviction
on
that.
then
it
goes
to
sentencing
as
to
where
the
sentencing.
and
it
is
the
quintessential
adjustment
for
punishment
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
first
adjustment
is
the
amount
of
money
involved.
the
definition
of
this--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--i
submit
it...
it
is
not
outside
the
schmuck
understanding
and...
as
a
subset
of
the
universal
monetary,
0
to
a
million,
thousand
is
within.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
carrying
away
is
a
common
law
term
signifying
asportation.
asportation
was
understood
to
mean
the
slightest
movement,
a
hair's
breadth
some
call
it.
as
my
adversary
spoke
the
last
time
this
matter
was
presented
to
the
court,
it
could
involve
a
movement
involving
one
foot,
whether
it
be
the
foot
or
a
hand.
the
common
law
understood
it,
and
that's
why
robbery
was
defined
and
understood
as
aggravated
larceny.
the
asportation,
the
carry
away,
is
in
that
take
language
of
the
robbery
statute.
when
you
take
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another,
there
is
a
slight
movement.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
that...
that
term
is
no
longer
there.
the
government
agrees
it
was
there
from
its
inception
in
1934
when
bank
robbery
was
codified
right
through
1948.
so,
we
have
to
find
the
meaning
with
it
not
being
there
for
today's
purposes.
i
submit
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
and
the
context
in
the
1948
recodification.
context
may
clarify.
context
may--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--intent
to
steal.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
feloniously
had
modified
the
term
to
take
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another.
steal
was
not
a
common
law
term.
steal
was...
the
definition
of
steal
was
take
from
a
person
or
presence
of
another.
so,
there
was
common
law
meaning,
common
law
language
and
understanding
right
in
the
bank
robbery
provision.
feloniously
falls
out.
we
cannot
say
it
is
there
today.
but
why
does
it
fall
out?
and
i
submit
it
falls
out,
explained
adequately...
and
the
only
explanation...
in
the
prince
decision
as
a
change
of
phraseology,
to
tidy
up
the
whole
code.
the
code
had
become
very
cumbersome
with
much
language
distinguishing
felonies
from
misdemeanors.
and
all
of
the
felony
language
and
misdemeanors
had
been
deleted
from
the
actual
definitions
of
the
crimes
because
a
new
provision
was
added,
section
1
of
title
18,
that
defined
a
felony--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--the
term
feloniously
was
not
in
the
larceny
provision.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
that...
that
may...
that
may
explain
it.
i
do
not
know.
i
do
know,
however,
that--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
in
the
statute
interpreted
by
the
court
in
morissette,
the
conversion
statute,
641
of
title
18...
and
morissette
previously
had
the
term
feloniously.
and
i
think
the
wisdom
of
the
morissette
opinion...
and
the
wisdom
of
the
morissette
opinion
and
its
application
to
this
case
is
the
language
in
morissette
that
the
court--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--i
think
there's
a
subtle
difference.
what
your
honor
says
is
all
correct.
the
morissette
opinion
substituted
a
knowing
mens
rea
into
a
statute
because
the
common
law
understanding
of
the
crime
of
conversion
did
not
have
a
specific
intent
element.
it
only
had
a
general
intent
element.
the
court
was
interpreting
conversion.
at
common
law
conversion
was
understood...
and
it
was
not
a
common
law
offense.
it
was
among
one
of
the
first
statutes
codified
in
the
old
english
law.
it
required
an
act
inconsistent
with
the
rights
of
the
true
owner.
and
that's
what...
so,
what
the
morissette
opinion,
i
submit,
stands
for
is
the
missing
element.
if
congress
has
not
specifically
contraindicated
that
as
departing
from
the
centuries
of
understanding,
the
missing
element
that
the
court
would
imply
in
is
what
had
appeared
at
common
law,
meaning
a
general
intent
for
the
conversion
offense--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
my
point
is
the
missing
mens
rea
in
the
conversion
statute
interpreted
in
morissette
was
a
general
mens
rea,
a
general--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--whereas
robbery
is
specific
intent
to
steal.
always
it's
been
understood
that
in
the
mere
deletion
of
the
felonious
word,
consistent
with
morissette,
you're
going
to
imply
in
the
mirror
image,
the
specific
intent
to
steal.
and
that
best
fits.
this
is
the
best
fit
with
the
court's
prior
holdings
in
prince
and
heflin.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
exactly,
justice
souter.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
exactly.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
we...
we...
in
our
brief
there's
a
quote
right
out
of
blackstone
where
they
were...
are
distinguished.
it's
a
lesser
offense.
petty
larceny
is
the
same
as
robbery.
robbery
is
an
aggravated
compound
larceny,
and
petty
larceny
could
be
differentiated
in
terms
of
punishment,
the
threshold
being
the
sixpence.
and
we
say--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--grand
larceny
was
greater
than
the
sixpence,
but
grand
larceny
was...
blackstone
says
it's
right
within
the
robbery
understanding.
the
sixpence
threshold
went
to
punishment
and
distinguished
between
a
misdemeanor
and
felony
offense.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
after
1948--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--my
understand--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i
would
say
it
is
a
robbery.
i
did
not
understand
the
hypothetical
that
there
was
no
intent
to
steal
initially
when
i
answered
no.
robbery
does
require
an
intent
to
steal
is
our
position.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
well,
the
modern
statute
has
done
away...
what
your
honor's
hypothetical
encompasses
is
the
common
law
defense
of
a
good
faith
claim
of
right.
and
the
modern
bank
robbery
provision
takes
that
away
specifically
by
congressional
pronouncement
when
it
says
take
the
money
in
the
care--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--in
the
care,
custody,
and
control
of
the
bank.
so,
it's
broader
than
the
common
law
definition,
but
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
common
law
understanding--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--at
common
law,
a
crime
of
larceny
could
be
defeated
by
showing
that
the
perpetrator
had
a
good
faith
claim
of
right.
we
have
the
fisherman's
case
or
where
someone
thinks
they're
getting
their
own
money
back.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
that
would
defeat
the--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--that
was
an
affirmative
defense
for
both
larceny
and
robbery.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
he's
guilty
of
violating
2113(a).
and
the
court
may
not...
no
court
may
ever
have
to
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
there's
a
specific
intent
to
steal
because
of
2113(a).
he's
taking
the
money
by
force
and
violence
that
is
in
the
care
of
the
bank,
and
that--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--it
is
an
element.
it
is
an
element.
it
has
always
been
understood
to
be
an
element.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i
submit
that
a
good
faith
claim
of
right
defense
has
been
taken
away,
but
there's
always
the
intent
to
steal.
there's
been
no
congressional
indication
and
it
has
to
come
from--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--if
you're
taking
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another,
you're
stealing.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no,
but
i
think
they
were
posed
to
try
to
illustrate
there
was
no
intent
to
steal
if
he
was
just
testing
the
security
of
the
bank.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
government
is
arguing
a
fact-based
inquiry
that
was
never
presented
to
the
jury,
and
indeed,
the
district
court
in
its
first
instance
made
no
determination
regarding
the
factual
evidence
in
this
case
whether
they
could
submit...
whether
they...
it
would
satisfy
the
elements
of
larceny.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
government
is
relying
upon
the
district
court's
decision
regarding
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
pursuant
to
rule
29
at
the
end
of
the
government's
presentation
of
the
evidence,
and
saying
that
amounts
to
a
directed
verdict
when
the
district
court
said,
i'm
not
going
to
instruct
this
jury
on
the
bank
larceny
provision.
that
just
simply
is
not
so.
the
district
court
never
made
a
factual
determination.
it
was
bound
by
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
mosley
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
i'm
not
permitted
as
a
district
court
judge
to
submit
this
to
the
jury.
and
that's
all
the
district
court
did.
the
district
court
did
summarize
the
evidence
solely
for
the
rule
29
function.
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence,
giving
the
government
the
best
benefit
of
all
reasonable
inferences
to
support
the
elements
of
robbery.
that
is
not
the
same
as
what...
if,
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
are
entitled
to
a
lesser
offense
of
robbery.
that
inquiry...
if
we
are
entitled
to
it
as
a
matter
of
law...
instruction
regarding
the
lesser
included
offense,
the
fact
that
a
district
court
ruled
on
the...
on
a
rule
29
motion
does
not
affect
the
jury's
determination,
does
not
affect...
the
government
is
essentially
arguing
that
it's
harmless
error,
and
this
court
in
its
first
instinct
could
say
it
looks
like
a...
a
robbery
to
me.
so,
that's
good
enough.
an
all
or
nothing
verdict,
as
the
court
pointed
in
beck
v.
alabama,
is
not
proper.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
citing
the
keeble
case...
it's
cited
in
the
morissette
opinion...
we
were
entitled
to
these
instructions
as
a
matter
of
law
if
there's
any
evidence,
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
that
could
support
our
theory
that
these
elements
are
met.
just
because
a
jury
convicted--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--there's
a
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--i
don't
recall
if
it
was
from
this
court,
your
honor,
the
scintilla.
that
car
was...
that
case
was
united
states
v.
escobar
debright
and
it
collected
a
number
of
cases
from
around
the
circuits
regarding
the
quantum
of
evidence
necessary
for
a
theory
of
a
defense
or
a
lesser
offense
i
submit.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
some
brief
points.
i
do
not
believe
the
common
law
understandings
of
these
two
offenses
is
as
malleable
as
my
adversary
says,
and
i...
both
sides
have
addressed
all
the
citations.
i
just
again
point
to
the
understanding
of
robbery
as
being
defined
and
understood
for
centuries
as
an
aggravated
larceny.
blackstone's
specific
words...
they
are
the
exact
same
understanding
with
all
the
elements
of
taking
and
carrying
away.
they
only
differ
by
punishment.
it's
all
there.
they
cannot
say
the
common
law
is
fuzzy
about
this
issue.
these
two
offenses
have
always
been
looked
upon--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--there
were
statutes
based
upon
the
common
law,
taking
the
common
law
terms.
the
common
law
was
an...
an
understanding
and
there
were
writings
and
case
law
publications
explaining
what
the
requirements
were
for
the
offense.
they
were
codified
in
judicial
opinions.
i
would
also
draw
the
court's
attention
to
a
structure
argument.
the
structure
of
2113
supports
a
finding
that
larceny
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
robbery.
if
you
look
to
2113(c),
the
receiving
stolen
property
provision,
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
receive
stolen
property
and
then
points
to
2113(b)
as
to
how
you
punish
that
receiver
of
stolen
property
and
you
punish
him
equally
the
same
as
you
would
punish
a
larcenist.
and
we
point
out
the
anomaly
of
that
at
page
8
of
our
reply
brief,
that
that
would
allow
a
receiver
of
stolen
property
from
a
bank
robber
to
go
unpunished
if
only
the
receiver
of
a
stolen
property
can
be
punished
as
to
(b).
but
this
mystery
disappears
if
the
understanding
is
2113(b)
is
a
lesser
offense
of
(a).
so,
receiving
the
proceeds
of
a
bank
robber
as
well
as
receiving
the
proceeds
of
a
larcenist
are
punished.
and
that
structure,
the
congressional
structure
there,
explains
and
gives
meaning
to
this
whole
centuries...
many,
many
centuries
of
the
understanding
that
larceny
is
a
lesser
offense
of
robbery.
policy
arguments
cannot
trump
the
text.
the
government
points
to
what
states
are
doing
now,
that
robbery
is
bad,
so
we're
going
to
make
it
easier
to
prove.
that
cannot
trump
the
congressional
text
here.
and
the
change
in
phraseology
is
not
a
specific
pronouncement
by
congress
that
it's
acting
contrary.
it's
a
mere
deletion
of
a
word,
as
was
pointed
out
in
morissette.
and
i
believe
morissette
understanding
is
that
tradition...
centuries
of
tradition
and
understanding
and
our
whole
criminal
jurisprudence
is
not
revolutionized
by
the
mere
deletion
of
one
word.
and
i
submit
that
the
mirror
of
the
offense
that's
being
interpreted,
just
as
it
was
in
morissette,
the
offense
of
conversion
that
required
a
knowing
element
that
was
read
in
as
a
mens
rea...
it's
always
been
the
requisite
element
of
intent
to
steal
at
robbery.
and
that's
what
it
was
from
1934
to
1948.
and
i
think
to
square
with
the
prince
holding,
that
the
heart
and
the
gravamen
of
the
offense...
and
the
prince
court
said
that
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
of
robbery
is
the
intent
to
steal.
when
you
put
the
prince
case
with
morissette,
the
only
square
reading
is
to
imply
the
mens
rea
of
a
specific
intent
to
steal,
and
there's
nothing
radical
about
it.
it's
consistent
with
many,
many
centuries.
thank
you,
your
honors.
