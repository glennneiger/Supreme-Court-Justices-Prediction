justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question
going
back
to
the
dollar
problem
in
the
case?
is
it
correct
that
at
common
law
both
petty
larceny
and
grand
larceny
were
lesser
included
offenses
of
robbery
even
though
there
wasn't
that
subdivision
in
robbery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
these
cases,
has
the
government
ever...
ever
taken
the
position
that
they
can
charge
both
offenses
and
get
cumulative
punishment
for
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
under
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
typical
case...
john
dillinger
statute...
he
goes
in,
robs
a
bank.
you
could...
under
your
view
of
the
statute
in
every
single
transaction,
you
could
punish
him
for
both
crimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
forget
the
sentencing
guidelines.
just
as
a
matter
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
wouldn't
that
be
taken
care
of
in
the
instruction
to
the
jury.
you'd
say
to
the
jury,
if
you...
if
you
find
he
didn't
have
the
intent,
you
may
find
him
guilty
of...
of
larceny.
and
in
order
to
find
him
of
grand
larceny,
you
must
find
$1,000
or
petty
larceny,
less.
but
one
or
the
other
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
and
the
jury
would
have
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
dollar
amount
was
satisfied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
just...
let
me
just
ask
one
question.
was
that
the
rule
at
common
law?
your
opponent
says
it
was,
and
i
guess
you...
you
disagree
with
him?
