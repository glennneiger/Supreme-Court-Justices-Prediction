justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do...
do
you
agree
that
we
apply
the
so-called
elements
test
to
determine
whether
it's
a
lesser
included
offense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
so,
then
we
have
to
decide...
even
if
you're
right
about
intent
to
steal,
what
about
the
requirement
in
the
larceny
statute
that
property
be
carried
away,
which
doesn't
appear
in
the
bank
robbery
statute?
and
what
do
we
do
about
the
monetary
value
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
court
says
it
doesn't
go
to
punishment,
it's
an
element?
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
this
was
$16,000.
it
wasn't
under
$1,000.
this
was
a
$16,000
heist.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
court
were
to
think
it
was
an
element
not
going...
not
a
sentencing
factor,
but
an
element?
then
what
do
you
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you've...
you've
not
addressed
the
carrying
away
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
question
about
intent
to
steal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
if
you
have
something
else
to
add.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
in
prince
v.
united
states,
we
considered
whether
the
crime
of
entering
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
robbery
is
merged
with
the
crime
of
robbery
if
robbery
is
consummated.
and
we
said,
yes,
there's
a
merger
because
the
heart
of
the
crime
of
entering
the
bank
with
intent
to
commit
robbery
is
the
intent
to
steal.
and
apparently
we
thought
at
the
time
of
prince
that
that
was
the
intent
element
of
bank
robbery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it...
is
it
possible
that
in...
that
in
interpreting
a
statute
like
the
bank
robbery
statute,
which
doesn't
spell
out
anymore
the
intent
to
steal
requirement,
that
the
court
could
interpret
it
as
incorporating
the
old
common
law
intent
to
steal
element?
