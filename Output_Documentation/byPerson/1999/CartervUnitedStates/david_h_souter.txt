justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
simple
answer
that
the...
that
the...
whatever
it
is...
the...
the
lesser
degree
of...
of
larceny
is
clearly
included
because
there
is
no
particular
value
requirement
there
at
all?
i
mean,
if
the
value
is
anything
above
0,
you're...
the
lesser
offense
value
requirement
is
made,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
you
have
to
do
to...
to
win
your...
i
mean,
on
this
point,
that's
all
you
have
to
show
to
win
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let's...
i
mean,
in
order
for
you
to
prevail
here,
i
think
all
we
would
have
to
conclude
was
that
there
was
some
value
requirement
in
the
robbery
statute,
as
you
pointed
out,
and
that
there
was
some
value
requirement
in
at
least
one
version
of
larceny.
and
in
the
lesser
grade
of
larceny,
there's
no
requirement
to
prove
$1,000
or
anything
else.
as
long
as
there...
as
long
as
there
is
proof
of
something
more
than
0,
the
value
requirement
is
made.
and
that's
all
you
need,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
all
you
want
is
a
lesser...
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
case.
i
thought
all
you
wanted
was
some
lesser
included
instruction
for
larceny.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if
you
get
a
lesser
included
instruction
for
whatever
it
is,
the...
the
minor...
the
lesser
larceny,
that's
all
you
want.
or
do
i
misunderstand
what
you're
asking
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
just
go
back
to...
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
your...
understand
your
argument.
i...
and
this
is
what
i
think
your
argument
is.
if
i'm
wrong,
tell
me
i'm...
tell
me
where
i
go
wrong.
i...
i
think
you
were
saying
in
so
many
words
that
feloniously,
under
the
statute
prior
to
the
revision,
had
two
functions.
one
function
was
to
say
this
is
a
felony
and
will
be
punished
as
such.
second
function
is
to
say
you
must
prove
intent
to
steal
because
that's
what
feloniously
implied
at
common
law.
they
dropped
the
word
feloniously
when
they
adopted
what
is
now,
i
guess,
section
1,
which
explains
what
crimes
are
felonies
and
what
crimes
are
misdemeanors.
so,
they
didn't
need
feloniously
for
the
first
purpose
anymore.
but
your
argument
is
that
when
they
dropped
it
as
redundant
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
the
crime
as
a
felony,
they
didn't
mean
to
redefine
the
elements
of
the
crime
to
omit
intent
to
steal.
have
i
got
it
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it's
not
intent
to
steal,
i
mean,
within
justice
breyer's
hypo.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
robbery.
all
right.
so
that
on
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
if
in
frustration
the
depositor
goes
into
the
bank
with
a
gun
and
says
to
the
teller,
give
me
my
$200
and
that's
what
he
believes,
that
it
is
his
$200,
is
he...
is
he
guilty
of
robbery
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
i
think
you're
saying
intent
to
steal
is
not
an
element.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
my
hypothetical,
he
doesn't
have
an
intent
to
steal.
he's
trying
to
get
his
own
money.
he's
wrong.
but
his
intent...
his
state
of
mind
is
it's
my
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in
the
real
world,
that
proof
requirement
is
going
to
be
as
simple...
is
satisfied
as
simply
as
rolling
off
a
log.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
yes.
i'm
sure
that
happens.
it's,
you
know,
winter
is
coming
and
the
guy
needs
new
shoes.
but
we...
we
know
that.
but
that...
i...
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
was
motivated
by
that
kind
of...
of
concern.
defendants
do
not
customarily
take
the
stand
and
say,
look,
i
was
only
doing
this
because
i
need
a...
a
good
place
to
sleep.
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
for
misdemeanor
larceny,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
frederick,
on...
on
that
point,
just
a
historical
question.
is
it
correct
that
in
the
1948
revision,
one
of
the
things
that
clearly
was
being
done
by
congress
was
to
substitute
a...
a
general
definition
to
distinguish
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors
to
take
the
place
of
individual
statements...
or
provisions
in
individual
statutes?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
it
would
also...
i
think
it
would
also
be
consistent,
based
on...
if
i
understand
what
you've
told
me,
it
would
also
be
consistent
with
the...
the
1948
action
to
say
that
the
change
in
phraseology,
i.e.,
dropping
the
word
feloniously,
was
a
change
in
phraseology
which
was
justified
by
the
fact
that
the
need
for
particular
phraseology
to
indicate
a
felony
had
been
superseded
by
a
general
felony/misdemeanor
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
could
read
it
either
way
i...
i
would
think.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
nothing...
nothing
dispositive
about
it.
it's
just
one
thing
for
us
to
look
at,
and
i
think
it's
still
relevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your...
your
argument...
i
think
your
argument
for
the
plausibility
of
concluding
that
dropping
feloniously
dropped
the
intent
to
steal
requirement
is
that
in
the
earlier
hobbs
act
provision
there
had
been,
in
effect,
a
conversion
of
the
concept
of
robbery
from
a...
a
primarily...
from
a...
let's
say
from
a...
a
property
plus
personal
violence
crime
to
something
closer
to
a
personal
violence
crime.
and...
and
that's
your...
i
think
that's
your
best
argument
for
saying,
therefore,
dropping
feloniously
in
'48
was...
was
probably
meant
to
signal
not
merely
that
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
define
felonies
in
particular
provisions,
but
to
signal
a...
a
conceptual
change
in
giving...
giving
emphasis
to
the
personal
violence
part
of
robbery.
i
mean,
that's
your
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
year
did
it
do
that?
