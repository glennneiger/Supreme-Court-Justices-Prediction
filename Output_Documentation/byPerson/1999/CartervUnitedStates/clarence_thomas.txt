justice
clarence
thomas
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
number
99-5716,
carter
versus
united
states.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
petitioner
floyd
carter
entered
a
bank
wearing
a
ski
mask.
he
proceeded
to
jump
over
the
teller
counter
and
take
almost
$16,000
in
cash
from
the
teller
drawers.
he
fled
the
scene
but
was
apprehended
later
that
day.
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
petitioner
on
a
violation
of
section
2113(a)
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code.
that
section
punishes
a
person
who
by
force
and
violence
or
by
intimidation
takes
anything
of
value
and
possession
of
any
bank.
at
trial
petitioner
did
not
contest
the
basic
facts
of
the
episode
but
contended
that
the
taking
was
not
facilitated
by
force
or
intimidation
as
section
2113(a)
requires.
in
the
hope
of
giving
the
jury
an
option
of
convicting
him
on
the
less
severe
crime
described
by
section
2113(b)
which
does
not
require
force
or
violence,
petitioner
requested
that
the
trial
court
instruct
the
jury
that
it
could
convict
him
under
section
2113(b).
the
trial
court
declined
to
give
such
an
instruction
and
the
jury
instructed
on
section
2113(a)
alone
returned
a
guilty
verdict.
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
under
our
decision
in
schmuck
versus
united
states,
a
defendant
who
requests
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
offence
under
rule
31(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
must
demonstrate
that
the
lesser
offence
is
a
lesser
included
offence
of
the
charged
offence,
i.e.
the
defendant
must
show
that
the
elements
of
the
lesser
offence
are
a
subset
of
the
elements
of
the
charged
offence.
here
the
lesser
offence
described
by
section
2113(b)
fails
this
test,
because
it
requires
three
elements
that
are
not
required
by
the
charged
offence
that
is
under
section
2113(a).
first,
section
2113(b)
unlike
section
2113(a)
requires
that
the
defendant
act
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin.
second,
section
2113(b)
again
unlike
section
2113(a)
requires
that
the
defendant
carry
away
the
property
after
he
has
taken
it.
third,
section
2113(b)
in
its
first
paragraph
requires
that
the
property
taken
have
a
value
exceeding
$1,000,
section
2113(a)
by
contrast
contains
no
valuation
requirement.
petitioner
advances
several
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
are
asserted
to
point
in
a
different
direction.
we
agree
that
the
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
are
applicable
in
this
context,
but
conclude
that
they
do
not
in
this
case
warrant
a
departure
from
what
is
indicated
by
a
straightforward
reading
of
the
text.
the
opinion
discusses
petitioners,
various
statutory
arguments
in
detail.
i
will
describe
briefly
his
primary
argument
that
section
2113(b)
should
be
deemed
a
lesser
included
offence
of
section
2113(a)
because
these
offences
resemble
the
common
law
crimes
of
larceny
and
robbery
respectively,
and
the
common
law
treated
larceny
as
a
lesser
included
offence
of
robbery.
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
larceny
and
robbery
bore
this
relationship
at
common
law.
however,
we
do
not
find
the
common
law
relevant
to
the
interpretive
task
at
hand,
because
our
cases
instruct
that
the
common
law
is
a
guide
only
when
the
statute
uses
a
term
with
established
meaning
at
common
law.
neither
the
term
robbery,
nor
the
term
larceny
appears
in
the
text
of
section
2113.
although
the
word
robbery
appears
in
section
2113â€™s
title,
the
title
of
a
statute
is
of
use
only
to
clarify
ambiguity
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
petitioner
does
not
claim
there
is
any
such
ambiguity.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
