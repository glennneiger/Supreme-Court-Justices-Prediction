mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
bank
larceny,
felony
bank
larceny,
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
bank
robbery
because
it
requires
proof
of
three
elements
not
found
in
the
robbery
provision:
the
intent
to
steal
or
purloin,
the
carrying
away
of
the
property,
and
that
the
property
is
worth
more
than
$1,000.
by
contrast,
bank
robbery
requires
proof
that
force--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sorry.
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
i
apologize.
those
three
elements
under
the
schmuck
test
require
a
finding
that
larceny
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
robbery.
justice
breyer,
to
go
to
your
question
on
intent
to
steal,
this
is
in
our
view
an
important
element,
and
i
do
not
want
to
digress
to
the
point
of
hypotheticals
where
the
person
steals
his
own
money
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
we
have
given
you
the...
we
have
given
you
this
fact
situation
in
the
footnote
in
our
briefs.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
that
happens
every
single
year--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--where
the
defendant
commits
a
bank
robbery
because
he
is
unable
to
live
in
a
free
society
and
in
a
comfortable
way
and
commits
a
bank
robbery
with
the
intent
of
getting
captured.
and
the
important
point
here--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--he
doesn't
have
an
intent
to
deprive
permanently
the
custodial
arrangement
of
the
bank
of
property.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
what
is
important
here
is
what
the
prosecution
must
plead
and
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
congress,
in
enacting
the
bank
robbery
provision,
would
not
want
to
subject
the
government
to
proof
where
the
robber
had
engaged
in
such
unambiguously
dangerous
activity
as
using
force
or
putting
somebody
in
fear
or
intimidation
to
take
property.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
souter,
in
addition
to
the
instance
where
the
person
is
not
committing
the
robbery
with
the
intent
to
steal
because
he
wants
to
go
back
to
prison,
there
are
circumstances
and
there...
there
are
real
cases
where
the
defendant
commits
the
robbery
with
the
purpose
of
having
the
bureau
of
prisons
provide
health
care
for
the
person.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
common
law--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--you
know,
justice
scalia,
i
would
want
to...
to
refer
to
the
common
law
in
this
regard.
the...
the
references
to
blackstone
and
to
other
commentators
are
rather
imprecise
with
respect
to
the
elements,
and
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
focus
on
the
language
that
congress
actually
used.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
words
that
congress
actually
used
in
not
having
an
intent
to
steal
requirement
were
consistent
with
the
modern
trend
of
legislatures,
including
congress,
to
make
robbery
a
general
intent
crime
because
robbery
is
a
crime
against
the
person,
and
the
social
evil
that
legislatures
are
legislating
against
is
the
knowing
use
of
force
to
take
property
from
a
person.
it's
not
the
interest
of
many
state
legislatures
to
be
concerned
with
what
the
robber's
ultimate
intent
with
respect
to
the
property
is.
rather,
it
is
the
means
that
he
employs
to
take
the
property
and
that
is
what
congress
was
legislating
against.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
could
you
rephrase
your
question
please,
sir?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
have
two
other
examples
to
provide
the
court
for
its
consideration.
one
is
the
hostage
situation
where
the
robber
takes
possession
of
the
bank
and
has
control
over
the
bank
for
the
sole
purpose
of
engaging
in
a
hostage
situation.
a
taking
has
occurred
of
the
property
with
force
and
violence,
but
the...
but
the...
the
defendant
does
not
have
a
demonstrable
intent
to
dispossess
the
bank
of
those
funds.
a
second
real
world
practice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it's
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
the
elements
that
congress
provided
demonstrate
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
the
kind
of
behavior
that
should
be
held
criminally
culpable.
and
that
is
our
point
here,
that
when
we
read
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
government
has
consistently
charged
these
as
independent
provisions,
according
to
their
elements,
from
the
time
of
enactment
up
until
the
present
day.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct
for
the
two
additional
reasons
that
we've
highlighted
as
differences
between
these
two
provisions,
that
there
is
no
carrying
away,
asportation,
requirement
in
bank
robbery
and
that
for
a
felony
bank
larceny
to
be
made
out,
the
prosecution
must
plead
and
prove
that
the
property
is
worth
more
than
$1,000.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
as
to
the
valuation
element,
justice
souter,
but
there's
no
carrying
away
requirement
as
a
distinction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i...
i
cannot
give
you
the
specific
charging
practice.
i
can
tell
you
what
the
reported
cases
say,
which
is
that
the
government
had
argued
that
they
were
distinct
offenses
which
required
proof
of
distinct
elements.
some
courts
accepted
that
view
of
the
government,
some
courts
did
not.
and
in
fact,
it
was
the
circuit
split
that
ultimately
led
up
to
the
prince
decision
requiring
merger
in
the
entry
and
in
the
completed
bank
robbery
offense.
that
best
evidence
is
the
fact
that
the
government
had
consistently
taken
the
position
with
respect
to
these--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--prior
to
prince,
the
government
did
take
that
position.
after
prince,
the
government,
to
my
knowledge,
has
not
been...
has
not
been
prosecuting
both
simply
as
a
way
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
i
would
point
out,
though,
that
with
respect
to
the
punishing
element,
it
would
have
no
real
practical
consequence.
in
this
case,
this
petitioner
was...
he...
convicted
of
three
bank
larcenies
in
a
different
district,
and
for
sentencing
purposes,
his...
his
sentence
was
assessed
as
a
result
of
the
bank
robbery
that
he
committed
in
this
case
after
his
bank
larcenies.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
we
don't
know
what
the
facts
are
in
those
other
cases
other
than
what
the
petitioner
has
represented.
and
we
do
not
know
what
proof
the
prosecution
had
as
to
the
use
of
force,
violence,
or
intimidation
in
those
cases.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
as
a
matter
of
the
way
the
sentencing
guidelines
work.
we
could
prosecute--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
could
prosecute
him
for
both--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
it
requires
proof
of
distinctive
elements.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
this
is
no
different
from
the
way
many
state
courts
have
construed
modern
robbery
statutes.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
connecticut
statutory
scheme,
which
we
have
set
out
the
statute
at
page
17
of
our
brief,
which
defines
robbery
as
a
larceny
plus
the
use
of
force.
and
yet,
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
we
quote
the
boucino
case
which
holds
categorically
that
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
problem
in
charging
both
grand
larceny
and...
and
robbery
because
they
require
proof
of
distinctive
elements.
the
court
there
said
robbery
requires
proof
of
the
use
of
force,
which
larceny...
grand
larceny
does
not,
and
grand
larceny
requires
proof
that
the
money
taken
had
a
specific
monetary
value
above
a
certain
threshold,
which
robbery
does
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
it
requires
the
prosecution
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
element
which
changes
the
offense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
changes
the
constitutional
requirements,
justice
scalia,
because
in
this
provision,
felony
bank
larceny
requires
that
fact
to
be
put
in
the
indictment
and
found
by
the
grand
jury.
the
constitutional
requirement
for
that
is
such
that
it
has
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
depends
on
how
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
conclusive
answer
at
common
law
because
even
blackstone
was
reciting
not
just
common
law
decisions,
but
also
the
statutes.
if
you...
if
you
read
the
chapter
that...
that
is
cited
by
both
sides
from
blackstone,
throughout
blackstone
is
saying
that
common
law
rules
were
changed
by
parliament
in
the
time
of
king
george
ii
and
king
george
iii,
precisely
because
the
common
law
rules
were
not
deemed
adequate
to
meet
the
evolving
needs
of
british
society.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
what
the
rule
in
england
is
now,
but
i
do
know
that
the
rule
in
the
states
of
the
united
states
is
that
in
those
places
where
state
legislatures
have
changed
the
elements
of
the
crime,
robbery
and
larceny
are
not
lesser
and
greater
included
offenses
where
robbery
does
not
require
proof
of
elements
that
are
found
in
larceny.
and
we
have
set
out
these
cases
in
our
brief.
they
go
unrebutted.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
go
unrebutted
by
the
other
side,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
those
specific
elements
on
all
three
of
them.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
state
courts
construing
2113
or
state
courts
construing
their
own
robbery
and
larceny
statutes?
because
i
think
with
respect
to
the
former,
i'm
not
aware
of
state
cases--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
actually
that's
not
correct
because
there's
not
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
this
provision.
but--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
large
number
of
those.
there
are
a
smattering
of
cases
over
the
years.
but
if
i...
if
i
can
get
to
the
gist
of
your
question,
it
all
depends
on
the
jurisdiction
that
you
are
looking
at.
and
i
have
not
looked
at
all
50
states,
but
i've
looked
at
enough
of
them
to
be
able
to
tell
you
with
high
confidence
that
virtually
every
jurisdiction
has
a
slight
difference
with
respect
to
these
various
elements.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
the
thomas
crowne
affair
involved
a
larceny
and
not
a
robbery,
and
that
distinction
is
critical
because
if
thomas
crowne
had
pulled
out
a
gun
and
used
force
to
take
the
painting,
regardless
of
what
he
ultimately
intended
to
do
with
it,
he
would
have
done
something
that
demonstrates
criminal
culpability.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
if
i
could
get
out
all
the
various
answers
that
i
have
to
that
question,
justice
breyer,
on
page
20
of
our
brief
we
cite
a
rash
of
federal
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
hold
that
robbery
is
a
general
intent
crime
not
a
specific
intent
crime
because
of
the
real
world
situation
that
defendants
come
to
court
arguing
they
did
not
intend
to
steal
because
they
were
drunk
or
they
were
on
drugs
or
they
had
some
other
kind
of
mental
defect
that
prohibited
them
from
having
the
full
intent
to
steal.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
sure.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'll
get
them
out.
i'll
my
points
out.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
respectfully
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
provision
as
it
was
worded
then
is
as
it
is
worded
now,
and
it
was
intent
to
commit
a
felony
or
larceny.
there
was
no
intent
to
steal
word
in
second
paragraph
(a).
the
court
used
that
as
a
very
loose
shorthand.
it
did
and
it
also
said
that
with
respect
to
two
provisions,
paragraphs,
that
are
not
directly
at
issue
here.
second
paragraph
(a)
prohibits
entry
into
the
bank
with
the
requisite
intent,
and
what
the
court
there
said
was
that
for
punishment
purposes,
the
two
shall
merge
if
the
person
enters
with
the
intent
to
commit
the
robbery
and
then
actually
commits
the
robbery.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
would
suggest
not
for
the
following
reasons.
congress
had
before
it
a
decision
about
how
much
of
the
common
law
to
import
when
it
drafted
the
bank
robbery
statute.
of
the
eight
elements
of
bank
robbery,
only
three
track
the
common
law:
the
word
takes,
the
use
of
force,
and
in
the
person
or
presence
of
another.
as
to
the
other
five
elements,
congress
expressly
departed
from
the
common
law.
the
theory
of
reading
back
in
an
intent
element,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
omitted
it
in
1948,
would
lead
to
some
very
strange
results
that
would--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
if
i
could
correct
your
understanding
of
our
previous
colloquy,
you
asked
me
whether
intent
to
steal
was
encompassed
within
the
word
feloniously.
i
said
it
was.
you
asked
me
whether
or
not
that
meant
that
before
'48
bank
larceny
was
a
lesser
included
offense
of
robbery,
and
i
said
no
because
of
the
other
two
elements.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
carrying
away
and
the
monetary
valuation
element.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
i
said
before
was
that
we
would
prosecute
that
person,
and
what
i
also
said
before
was
that
it
was
unclear
whether
we
would
prevail
because
numerous
jurisdictions
held
that
a
carrying
away
would
not
be
completed
until
the
person--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--to
prosecute.
there
are
no
reported
cases
on
that
hypothetical,
but
there
are
cases
from
state
jurisdictions
which
hold
that
when
a
person
is
taking
property
within
a
store
or
other
kind
of
business,
an
asportation
is
not
satisfied
until
the
person
leaves
the
premises.
and
every
year...
every
year...
we
prosecute
people
who
attempt
to
get
out
of
the
bank
and
we
catch
them
before
they
leave.
and
in
those
cases,
the
effect
of
a
carrying
away
element
would
transform
completed
bank
robbery
in
our
view
into
an
attempted
bank
robbery.
that
would
be
the
effect
of
your
reading
in
an
asportation
element
that
congress
made
an
explicit
decision
not
to
read
in.
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
was
one
of
the
purposes
for
deleting
feloniously
as
to
certain
offenses,
justice
souter.
and
what
we
have
done
in
describing
what
the
reviser
explained
with
respect
to
certain
robbery
offenses
is
that
feloniously
was
taken
out
of
those
robbery
offenses,
but
the
reviser
used
a
different
explanation,
did
not
rely
on
section
1,
but
simply
said
that
changes
in
phraseology
were
made.
and
we
would
submit
that
that
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
decision
congress
had
made
in
1946,
which
was
to
define
robbery
under
the
hobbs
act
by
not
including
an
intent
to
steal
or
feloniously
element.
congress
defined
robbery
as
a
general
intent
crime,
which
was
the
precursor,
we
argue,
to
the
modern
trend
of
treating
robbery
as
a
crime
against
the
person
where
the
person's
demonstrable
criminal
conduct
is
to
use
force
to
take
property
away
from
the
person--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
it
was
this
court's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
point
is
what
the
reviser
said
is
ultimately
irrelevant
to
what
congress
enacted
and
the
words
that
are
in
the
statute
now.
this
court
in
wells
said
that
the
reviser
had
been
wrong
before
in
making...
in
describing
the
change
by
congress
as
substantive.
and
we
submit
there's
no
difference--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
and
ultimately
what
you
should
be
looking
at
is
the
text
of
the
statute
which
contains
these
three
very
clear
elements
that
the
prosecution
does
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
and
the
congress
did
the
same
thing
with
section
2111,
the
robbery
in
the
special
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
took
the
word
feloniously
out.
it
made
that
crime
a
general
intent
crime.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
1948
in
exactly
the
same
revision.
the
reviser
note
explained
that
that
was
a
change
in
phraseology,
and
what
congress
had
done
in
defining
all
three
of
these
robbery
offenses,
hobbs
act,
bank
robbery,
and
robbery
in
the
maritime,
was
to
convert
them
from
specific
intent
to
general
intent
crimes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
elements
are--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
the...
that
is
the
logical
result
of
our
position
because
the
elements
are
different.
it
no
different
than
in
the
blochberger
situation
for
double
jeopardy.
they
are
distinctive
cases.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
i
am.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
justice
ginsburg.
just
the
text
of
the
statute
as
it
currently
exists.
and
i
would
just
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
illogical
about
making
that
decision
because
of
the
emphasis
of
the
robber
on
using
force.
that
is
a
social
evil
congress
is
perfectly
justified
in
legislating
against
irrespective
of
what
the
robber
intends
to
do
with
the
property.
but
larceny
has
a
special
intent
to
steal
because
otherwise
innocent
conduct
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
sanction.
larceny
is
a
crime
against
the...
its
property
and
robbery
is
a
crime
against
the
person.
and
because
of
these
distinctive
evils,
it
is
perfectly
logical
to
think
that
congress
would
have
gone
in
the
same
way
that
states
have
gone
in
changing
robbery
from
a
specific
intent
crime
to
a
general
intent
crime.
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
point
to
the
court's...
several
points
in
the
record.
the
joint
appendix
at
a
indicates
that
the
element
of
bank
larceny
that
the
petitioner
here
asks
for
was
felony
bank
larceny,
so
even
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
our
submissions
as
to
the
carrying
away
and
intent
to
steal
element,
he's
not
entitled
to
a
special
jury
instruction
here
because
he
asked
for
felony
bank
larceny
with
the
monetary
element.
and
finally,
he
did
get
his...
his
instruction
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
the
joint
appendix
at
page
57
makes
absolutely
clear
that
the
theory
of
the
defendant
was
that
he
had
not
used
force
or
intimidation.
the
jury
had
to
make
a
finding
in
rejecting
the
defendant's
theory
in
this
case
and
it
did
so
because
the
defendant
here
had
a
ski
mask
on,
he
pushed
a
customer
twice,
he
vaulted
over
the
bank
counter,
he...
he
terrorized
the...
the
tellers
there
in
taking
the
money.
they
were...
they
were
too
startled
to
react.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
whether
the
court
decides
to
dismiss
the
writ
is
up
to
the
court.
we
pointed
this
out
in
our
brief
at
the
cert
stage.
we
pointed
it
out
in
the
mosley
case.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
as
a
legal
matter,
this
question
hardly
ever
arises.
the
last
footnote
of
our
brief
points
out
that
in
virtually
all
cases
where
the
defendant
asks
for
this
instruction,
the
facts
do
not
justify
the
giving
of
the
instruction.
so,
there
is
an
academic
quality
to
this
case.
we
would
concede
that,
but
we
did
not
bring
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
here.
and
we
are
entitled
to
defend
the
judgment
on
an
alternate
ground.
thank
you.
