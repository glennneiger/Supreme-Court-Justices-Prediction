but
then...
but
then
the...
the
greater
larceny
charge
would
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense
and
you
would
not
have
give
the
instruction
if
you
want
to
get
the
fellow
for...
i'm
sorry.
you
would
not
have
to
give
the
instruction
with
regard
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
going
to
help
you
very
much
if...
if
your
client
stole
a
yacht
and
the
jury
is
instructed,
you
need
not...
you
need
not
convict
him
of...
of
robbery
for
stealing
the
yacht
if
you
find
that
instead
he's
guilty
of
larceny
of
property
worth...
worth
less
than
$1,000.
that's
not
going
to
help
your
client.
don't
you
have
to
get
in
the...
both
of
the
two
larceny
statutes
in
order
to
get
where
you
want
to
get...
want
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
way
that...
that
the
lesser
larceny
instruction
would
have
helped
you.
the
jury
obviously
wouldn't...
couldn't
have
brought
back
a
verdict
on
the
lesser
larceny.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
asportation
involved
in
common
law
larceny
too?
did
common
law
larceny
require
asportation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
common
law
larceny
was
considered
a
lesser
included
offense
of
robbery
at
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
they
thought
that
feloniously
would...
would
confuse
the
reader
to
think
it
has...
it
was
a
felony,
rather
than
a
misdemeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
took
out
other
feloniously's?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
grand
larceny?
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
that.
the
phrase,
in
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
another.
what
does
that
have
the
effect
of
doing?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
larceny
or
robbery?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
makes
no
sense.
you...
you
can't
have
an
intent
to
steal
if
you
have
a
good
faith
claim
of
right.
i
mean,
you...
you
say
that
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
how
can
you
possibly
have...
have
an
intent
to
steal
if
you
have
a
good
faith
claim
of
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
intent
of
stealing
and
getting
caught
stealing.
i
mean,
but
he's
still
stealing.
i
don't
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
he
would
if
he
knew
that
that's
the
only
thing
that's
going
to
get
him
in
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
to
put
it
another
way,
why
is
leaving
it
out
of
the
statute
any
more
absurd
than
leaving
it
out
of
the
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
common
law
didn't
include
it.
was
the
common
law
absurd?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
cannot
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
to
get
him
for
bank
robbery.
justice
antonin
scalia
weird.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
some
other
provision
of
the
united
states
code
that...
that
would
cover
this
kind
of
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's...
let's
do
the
money.
i
happen
to
think
that
the...
that
the
$1,000...
less
than
$1,000
or
more
than
$1,000...
that
that
is
an
element,
not...
not
just
a
sentencing
factor.
but
does
that
kind
of
an
element
deprive
the
lesser
offense
of
its
character
as
a
lesser
offense?
suppose
you
have
a
statute
that
explicitly
says
after
the
robbery
statute,
as
a
lesser
offense
there
will
be
the
crime
of
larceny
which
will
be
punished
to
such
an
extent
if
the
larceny
is
for
less
than
$1,000,
and
to
a
greater
extent
if
the
larceny
is
for
more
$1,000.
i
don't
see
how
that...
that
causes
it
not
to
be
a
lesser
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
purpose
of
that
proof
is
just
to
decide
which
of
the
two
lesser
included
offenses
you
get
into,
but
to
get
into
the
category
of
lesser
included
offense,
you
don't
have
to
prove
anything.
the
only
purpose
of
that
$1,000
is
to
decide
whether
in
this
lesser
included
offense
of
larceny,
you're
going
to
be...
you're
going
to
be
in...
in
grand
larceny
or
petty
larceny.
i...
i
don't
think
that
that's
enough
to...
to
cause
it
to
be
a...
the
sort
of
an
element
that...
that
can
deprive
something
of
its
character
as
a...
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
common
law
include
any
statutes?
