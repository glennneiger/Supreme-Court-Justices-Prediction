mr.
richard
a.
devine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
september
9th,
1995,
when
william
wardlow
looked
at
officer
nolan
and
took
flight,
the
officer
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
a
problem.
he
pursued
and
stopped
wardlow
to
investigate
and
discovered
a
loaded
gun
in
his
possession.
the
three
key
factors
in
this
brief
statement
are
flight
from
a
clearly
identified
police
officer
without
provocation.
these
factors
provided
reasonable
suspicion
supporting
a
terry
stop.
at
the
core
of
this
case...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
yes,
your
honor.
the
reasonable
police
officer
had,
under
these
circumstances,
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
crime
was
afoot.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
throughout
the
history
of
this
country,
flight
has
been
considered
by
the
courts
and
by
commentators
as
inherently
suspicious.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
it
is
not...
it
is
not
required,
your
honor,
that
the
officer
have
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
particular
crime.
this
was
commented
on
in
anderson
and
in
lafave.
if
the
officer
has
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot,
as
this
court
has
noted,
there
may
be
innocent
behavior,
but
the
officer,
the
reasonable
officer,
can
stop
briefly
to
determine
whether
his
suspicions
are
justified
or
not.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
no,
your
honor.
and...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
it
is
our
submission
that
if
the
officer
has
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
may
be
some
type
of
criminal
activity...
and
flight
has
historically
been
related
to
criminal
activity,
as
mr.
burrill
noted
in
his
commentary
back
in
the
1860's,
that
flight
for
a
burglar,
an
arsonist,
a
robber
is
common,
and
that
in
fact
if
someone
committed
one
of
these
acts,
that
it
is
so
natural
to
flee
that
if
an
individual
did
not,
he
would
be
considered
mentally
deficient.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
you
would
not,
your
honor.
in
addition,
going
back
to
terry,
the
case
which
is
the
seminal
case
on
this
issue,
the
activity
that
the
officer
noted
was
as
consistent
with
innocent
behavior
as
with
what
the
officer
suspected,
namely
that
the
individuals
walking
around
were
casing
the
joint
preparing
to
rob
a
department
store.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
proposing
that
a
rule
be
adopted
that
is
not
limited
to
high
crime
areas.
we
believe
that
the
flight
is
so
inherently
suspicious
that
when
you
have
unprovoked
flight
from
an
identified
police
officer,
that
wherever
it
takes
place,
it
provides
the
reasonable
suspicion
necessary.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
no,
your
honor.
this,
in
fact,
comports
with
totality
of
the
circumstances.
but
what
we
do
say
is
when
these
three
factors
are
involved,
they
are
sufficiently
important
and
sufficiently
focused
that
they
provide
and
should
provide
the
officer
with
a
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
no,
your
honor,
there
are
three...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
there
are
three
factors
that
we
propose
be
part
of
the
rule:
one,
the
flight;
second,
that
it's
from
a
clearly
identifiable
police
officer;
and
thirdly,
that
it's
without
provocation
we
understand
that
just
flight
in
a
vacuum
doesn't
give
us
the
reason
to
say
that
there's
reasonable
suspicion,
but
when
the
three
factors
are
combined,
we
believe
that
that
is...
that
is
the
case.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
your
honor,
it
would
fit
in,
in
that
the
reasonable
police
officer,
the
standard
that
the
court
uses,
would
have
to
conclude
that
the
flight
was
in
response
to
his
presence
and
without
provocation.
so,
whatever
the
garb
of
the
individual,
if
he
looks
at
the
police
officer,
and
then
takes
off,
that
creates
the
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
in
that
case
if
the
individual
is
running
in
the
direction,
glances
at
the
police
officer,
and
continues
on.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
would
say
that
that's
ambiguous
behavior
that
would
fall
within
the
totality
of
circumstances
rather
than
within
the
rule
we're
proposing,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
i
would
again
note
that
flight,
going
back
to
the
time
of
the
framers,
has
been
considered
suspicious
behavior,
but
looking
at
the
balancing
this
court
does
in
analyzing
the
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment,
we
look
at
the
governmental
interest.
here
the
governmental
interest
is
a
police
officer
who's
on
the
scene,
sees
an
individual
look
at
him,
and
take
flight.
the
police
officer
does
not
have
the
ability
to
further
investigate.
the
police
officer
does
not
have
any
ability
to
find
out
what
is
going
on.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
your
honor,
i...
i
would
submit
an
alternative
thought,
namely
that...
that
flight
is
such
inherently
aberrant
behavior
that
it
does
create
the
reasonable
suspicion...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
this
court
has
commented
that
when
an
individual
flees
from
the
police,
common
sense
might
tell
us...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
know
some
of
the
justices
may
have.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
i
certainly...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
pardon
me,
your
honor.
certainly
in...
in
my
experience,
your
honor,
flight
from
the
arrival
of
police
officers,
as
they
go
about
the
duty...
about
their
duties,
is
not
a
common
experience.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
we
have
the
entire
history
of
this
country
with
the
commentators
and
the
cases
that
have...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
absolutely,
your
honor.
you
have
after
the
stop,
a
weapon
with
five
live
rounds
in
it
was
found
on
mr.
wardlow.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
again,
your
honor,
based
on
my...
my
view
of
it
as
a
prosecutor
for
a
number
of
years,
i
don't
believe
it
occurs
that
often.
but
what
we
are
talking
about...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
we
don't
have
any
to
submit,
your
honor.
we
have
the
history
of
this
country,
how
flight
has
been
looked
at
over
the
course
of
the
history
of
this
country.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
some
did,
your
honor,
but
burrill
in
his
commentaries,
referring
to
the
common
law,
clearly
referred
to
flight
from
the
scene
and
how
natural
it
was
for
criminals
to
flee.
in
addition,
wigmore,
that
was
cited
by...
who
was
cited
by
respondent,
also
talks
as
the
flight
being
the
evidential
matter
that
we
look
at.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
empirical
studies,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
i
would
first
note
that
in
many
of
those
same
neighborhoods,
the
victims
are
the
ones
who
are
concerned
about
crime
being
solved.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
but...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
my
response
is
that...
that
since
terry,
when
the
court
discussed
that
issue,
this
court
has
said
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
we
apply
a
colorblind
test.
we
look
at
the
balancing
outside
of
those
issues,
and
if
those
issues
are
there,
application
of
sanctions
under
the
fourth
amendment
isn't
going
to
resolve
them.
they
should
be
handled,
as
this
court
has
said,
as
recently
as
wren,
either
by
equal
protection
claims
or
section
1983
claims
or
administrative
charges
within
the
particular
police
department.
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
we
start
to
classify
when
we
can
do
a
fourth
amendment
stop,
based
on
terry,
or
arrest
based
on
probable
cause,
considering
what
the
race
of
the
police
officer
is,
the
race
of
the
individual
that
is
involved,
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
unworkable
and
will
prevent
the
police
officers
from
doing
the
job
that
we
want
them
to
do.
that's
why
we
believe
a
bright
line
rule
is
appropriate
here.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
we
do
submit
that...
and
the
high
crime
area
is
in
the
cert
petition,
but
we
submit
that
the
three
factors
that
we've
identified,
flight
without
provocation
from
a
clearly
identified
police
officer...
you
reach
a
point
where
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
with
those
factors.
and
we
believe
it
is
important
that
this
court
speak
clearly
on
this
because
a
police
officer
does
have
to
make
an
instantaneous
decision...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
if
it...
if
it
is
not
identified
as
flight
from
the
standpoint
of
the
reasonable
police
officer...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
we
would...
we
have
made
a
point
of
differing...
distinguishing
avoidance
from
flight.
turning
one's
gaze,
crossing
the
street,
walking
away
do
not
constitute
flight.
certainly
in
that
instance,
if
the
individual
in
the
car
sped
off
after
observing
a
police
officer,
we
would
say
that
is
flight
without
provocation
that
would
justify
the
terry
stop.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
provocation...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
if
the
police
officer,
for
example,
came
up
and
threatened
an
individual
and
they
ran
away,
that
would
not
be
flight
that
would
fall
within
the
definition.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
with
a
beating,
with
harassing
of
some
nature.
if
there
is
evidence
of
that,
that
the
police
officer
says
that,
or
if
the
police
officer
has
made
some
other
comment
to
the
individual
that
could
be
interpreted
as
threatening
him,
that
would
be
provocation.
we...
we
have
said
that
unprovoked
flight
is
where
a
reasonable
police
officer
can
say
it's
the
presence
of
the
police
officer
that
has
caused
the
individual
to
flee.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
if...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
if
a
police
officer
arrives
on
the
scene
to
see
who
will...
who
will
run
and
if
someone
does
run
at
the
presence
of
a
police
officer,
that
would
come
within
the
scope
of
what
we're
talking
about.
but
i'd
submit,
your
honor...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
would
say
that...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
that's
not
provoked
flight.
it
has
to
be
with...
so,
the
motivation
of
a
particular
police
officer
will
not...
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
we'll
look
at
the
reasonable
police
officer,
what
he
observes.
and
the
point
is
that
the
individual
who
is...
who
is
fleeing
creates
the
suspicion
by
flying
from
the
presence
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
the
police...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
this
court
have
noted,
the
police
have
the
right
to
walk
up
to
individuals,
to
question.
the
individual
may
not...
may
not
respond...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
oh,
that's
right,
your
honor.
yes,
he
does.
but...
but
it's
the
flight
from
the
presence
of
the
police
officer
that
creates
the
issue.
in
hodari...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
it
would
have
to
be
determined
to
be
flight,
your
honor.
and
that
walking
away
fast
does...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
my
power
walking
would...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
your
honor,
i
would...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
if
it's
the
presence
of
the
police
officers,
your
honor,
and
the
flight
from
that,
then
we
would
say
that's
not
provocation.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
no,
your
honor,
because
that
signals
the
police
officers
are
there
to
perform
a
function.
it
does
not
give
an
individual
the
basis
for
saying
i
have
to
just
get
away
from
this
situation.
it
creates
the
reasonable
suspicion.
and
the
reason
that
we
suggest
that
a
rule,
a
clearly
stated
rule,
is
appropriate
here,
there
are
circumstances
when
this
court
will
do
that,
as
you
did
in
maryland
v.
wilson,
saying
passengers
can
be
taken
out
of
a
car.
and
in
fact,
in
hodari,
we
believe
this
court
properly
clearly
talked
about
seizure
requiring
a
physical
restraint
where
the
subject
refuses
to
yield.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
no,
your
honor.
that's...
that's
the
other
side
of
this.
the
intrusion
on
the
liberty
interests
compared
to
the
need
to
do
good
police
work
is
minimal.
an
individual
can
be
stopped
for
a
few
brief
moments
for
some
questions,
limited
in
scope
related
to
the
suspicion
that
the
police
officer
originally
had.
so,
the
intrusion
on
the
liberty
of
the
individual
is...
mr.
richard
a.
devine
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
devine
in
order
to
stop
him,
that's
true.
if
the
person
did
not
yield
to
authority,
this
court
has
said
that
physical
control
is
necessary.
thank
you,
your
honor.
