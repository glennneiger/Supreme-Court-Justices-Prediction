justice
john
paul
stevens
would
be
the
same
rule
if,
say,
the...
the
person
who's
stopped
was
wearing
jogging
shoes
and
sweat
pants
and
a
sweatshirt
and
carrying
a
basketball?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
if
he
had
seen
him
running,
then
he
stopped
for
a
while,
then
he
saw
the
police
officer,
and
he
started
running
again?
that
would
still...
that
would
still
apply,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
stops.
he
had
stopped
and
he
was
catching
his
breath
and
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
police
officer
and
took
off.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
your
bright
line
rule?
would
it
apply
to
someone
driving
in
car
who
sees
an
officer
in
the
rear
window
and
then
decides
to
turn
off
because
he's
not
sure
he's
going
to
be
stopped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
is.
he...
that's
exactly
the...
he
just
doesn't
want
to
take
the
chance
on
being
stopped,
so
he
tries
to
get
away,
but
without...
without
evading
the
speed
limit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
still
troubled
or
concerned.
i'm
just
not
sure
i
understand
this
provocation
that
justice
kennedy
is
asking
about.
we
had
a
case
last
year,
i
know
you're
familiar
with,
on
the
loitering
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
as
a
remedy
of
that,
instead
of
doing
the
procedure
authorized
by
that
ordinance,
the
police
adopted
a
practice,
whenever
they
saw
a
group
of
young
men
standing
in
the
street
corner
to
come
with
a
siren
on
and
see
how
many
run.
would
that...
would
that
be
provocation
or
would
that
be
no
provocation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
his
presence
is
accompanied
by
turning
on
the
bright
light
and
the
siren.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
sure
that
a
running...
a
fleeing
person
could
be
tackled
by
the
police,
for
example,
couldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
police
officer
could
tackle
the
man
running
away
from
him,
couldn't
he?
he
has
to
seize
him
in
order
to
stop
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts?
the...
the
intermediate
court
and
the
illinois
appellate
court
had
a
more
thorough
discussion
of
the
facts
i
think
than
the
supreme
court
did.
and
there's
a
sentence
in
the
opinion
that
is...
the
record
here
is
simply
too
vague
to
support
the
inference
that
the
defendant
was
in
a
location
with
a
high
incidence
of
narcotic
trafficking
or,
for
that
matter,
that
defendant's
flight
was
related
to
his
expectation
of
police
focus
on
him.
now,
have
you
conceded
that
this...
that
your
client
fled
because
he
saw
the
police?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unprovoked...
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
certainly
not
my
recollection
of
the
three-pronged
argument.
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
asking
for
a
pretty
simple
per
se
rule.
