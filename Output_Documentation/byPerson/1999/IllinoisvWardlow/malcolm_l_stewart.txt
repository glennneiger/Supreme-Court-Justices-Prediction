mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
certainly
true,
as
respondent
and
his
amici
point
out,
that
individuals
may,
on
some
occasions,
have
innocent
motives
for
fleeing
the
police.
but
the
purpose
of
a
terry
stop
is
not
to
apprehend
individuals
who
are
known
to
be
guilty
of
criminal
offenses;
rather,
it's
to
provide
a
means
by
which
police
may
resolve
ambiguities
in
situations
where
they
have
reasonable...
reason
to
suspect
criminal
activity,
but
lack
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest.
and
in
our
view,
flight
from
identifiable
police
officers
will
ordinarily
correlate
sufficiently
with
likely
involvement
in
criminal
activity.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
we...
we
believe
you
should
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
i
think
in
the
end
our
position
is
not
significantly
different
in...
in
substance
from
the
petitioner's,
although
we
may
use
different
terminology.
our
view
is
that
ordinarily
when
an
individual
flees
at
the
sight
of
an
identifiable
police
officer,
under
circumstances
in
which
the
officer
reasonably
infers
that
the
individual
is
running
because
of
the
officer's
presence,
rather
than
for
some
other
reason,
ordinarily
that
would
raise
a
sufficient
inference
of
guilt
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
the
question
of
provocation
has...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there...
there
is
a...
there
is
no
right
to
avoid
police
observation
or
police
contact,
that
is
the
court...
in
public
areas.
public
areas
are,
by
their
nature,
subject
to
police
surveillance
and
this
court
has
held
that
even
without
particularized
suspicion,
police
may
approach
an
individual
on
the
street
and
request
voluntary
cooperation.
now,
there
is
a
liberty
interest
in
freedom
of
movement
in
public
areas,
and
the
police
may
not
arbitrarily
restrain
the
individual
in
that
exercise
of
liberty.
and
i
think
what
the
court
has
referred
to
as
an
individual's
right
to
go
on
his
way
is
really
simply
another
way
of
stating
that
without
particularized
suspicion,
the
police
can't
require
the
individual
to
answer
their
questions.
they
can't
even
require
the
individual
to
stand
still
long
enough
to
hear
the
questions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
i
think...
i
think
flight
is
really
different
fundamentally
in
at
least
three
respects
from
less
extreme
means
of
expressing
a
desire
to
avoid...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
okay.
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
is
distinctive
about
flight
is
that
in
many
cases
it
is
likely
to
connote
a
panicked
reaction,
an
emotional
reaction
to
the
police
presence.
and...
and
panic
is
in
our
view
more
likely
to
signal
consciousness
of
guilt
than
is
an...
an
emphatic,
salty
expression
of
disdain
for
the
police.
the
second...
the
second,
and
perhaps
the...
the
most
fundamental
difference
is
that
flight
expresses
the
desire
not
simply
to
refuse
cooperation
with
the
police,
but
to
be
free
from
any
form
of
police
observation
or
scrutiny.
and
that's
really
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
think
the
purposes
of
the
terry
stop
are
particularly
implicated
in
this
situation;
that
is,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
terry
stop
is
to
allow
the
police
briefly
to
freeze
the
status
quo
while
they
undertake
further
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
the
ground
for
frisking
him
is,
first,
the
belief
that
he
may
be...
the
ground
for
frisking
him
is
to
protect
the
officer's
safety
while
the
stop
is
taking
place.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
what
justice
harlan
was
saying...
i
don't
know
that
justice
harlan
had
in
mind
the
situation
in
which
police
had
an
articulable
basis
for
suspecting
criminal
activity
but
no
particular
crime
in
mind.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that's
correct.
and
in
terms
of
the
principles,
the
rationale
underlying
the
court's
terry
stop
jurisprudence,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
saying
that
police
have
to
be
concerned
with
a
particular
crime.
the
purpose
of
the
terry
stop
is
to
resolve
ambiguities,
and
in
united
states
v.
sokolow,
for
example,
the...
the
police...
the
law
enforcement
agents,
roughly
speaking,
had
drug
crimes
in
mind,
but
there
was
no
particular
form
of
narcotics
that
they
suspected.
there
was
no
particular
unlawful
transaction.
so,
to
return
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
part
of
the
reason
that
we
think
flight
is
extraordinary
again
is
that
it
denotes
a
desire
not
simply
to
refuse
cooperation,
but
to
avoid
all
forms
of
police
scrutiny.
and
for
that
reason,
in
our
view,
it's
a
particularly
appropriate
occasion
for
a
terry
stop.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
the...
if
the
police
see
somebody
running
in
the
elegant
neighborhood
and
the
running
appears
to
have
been
prompted
by...
by
their...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
suspicious,
and
we
would
say
it
is
sufficient
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
typically...
you
could
make
the
argument
either
way.
typically
the
courts
have
regarded
presence
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
as...
as
reinforcing
rather
than
undermining
suspicion,
but
i
think...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
i
think
our
basic
point
is
if
you
have
flight
from
an
identifiable
police
officer
in
apparent
response
to
the
officer's
arrival
and
nothing
else
on
either
side
of
the
scale,
that
should
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
here
we
think
that
the...
the
fact
that
this
occurred
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
at
least
somewhat
reinforces
the
inference
of
suspicion.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
certainly
if
the
individual
could
establish
that
within
a
particular
community
it
had
become
the
norm
for
people
to
flee
from
the
sight
of
an
apparent
police
officer
for
whatever
reason,
if
that
had
become
typical
behavior
within
the
community...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
i
think
certainly
the
general
rule
would
be
absent...
we
would
think
that
the
norm
in
most
and
perhaps
all
communities
is
the
innocent
people
don't
typically
flee
upon
the
arrival
of
the
police,
but
we
would
say
if
an
extraordinary
case
arose
in
which
a
person
could
actually
establish
that
this
had
become
accepted,
typical
behavior...
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
the
individual
always
will
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
other
contextual
factors
made
it
unreasonable
for
the
police
officer
to
infer
guilt
from
the
fact
of...
of
flight.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
if...
if
mr.
wardlow,
for
instance,
had
not
been
engaged
in
any
illegal
activity
and
if
he...
presumably
the
suppression
hearing
would...
would
never
have
arisen,
but
if
it
had
been
the
case
that
he
fled
because
he
was
sincerely
afraid
of
the
officer
and
felt
no
consciousness
of
guilt,
there
would
be
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
the
officer
would
have
behaved
reasonably
given
the
information
in
front
of
him
even
though
it
would
have...
thank
you,
your
honor.
