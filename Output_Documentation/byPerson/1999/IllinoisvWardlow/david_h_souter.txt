justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
devine,
the...
let
me
tell
you
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
your
proposal.
you...
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
quite
correctly,
that
under
any
reasonable
suspicion
rule,
some
innocent
people
are
going
to
be
stopped
or
are
liable
to
be
stopped
under
that
rule,
and
we
accept
that.
that's...
terry...
terry
starts
on
that
premise.
the...
the
trouble
is
how
high
is
the
risk
that...
that
innocents
are
going
to
be
stopped
or...
or
how
many
innocents
are
going
to
be
stopped
in
relation
to
the...
to
the
whole?
that...
that
seems
to
me
the
tough
question.
and
the
reason
it's
a
tough
question
here...
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
it...
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
accept
your
premises,
where
in
the
high
crime
area
a
clearly
identified
police
officer
arrives...
and
in
fact,
in
this
case
arrived
as...
i
guess
in
a
convoy
of...
of
four
cars...
it
seems
to
me
that
anyone
in
his
right
mind
is
going
to
want
to
get
out
of
the
way
fast.
if
i
were
standing
on
that
corner,
i
don't
know
whether
i
would
run
or
duck
into
a...
an
alleyway
or
what,
but
i
would
want
to
get
out
of
the
way.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
on
your
premise,
there
are
going
to
be
a
substantial
number
of
quite
innocent
people
who,
recognizing
the
spot
they
are
in,
are
going
to
go
on
and
get
just
as
far
away
from
the
police
and
any
shoot-out
or
whatnot
that
may
occur
as
they
possibly
can.
and
it
raises
the
specter
of
simply
too
many
innocent
people
getting
picked
up
on
your
rule.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
he
may
have
the
ability
to
note
a
number
of
other
facts
besides
the
one
that
you
mentioned,
and
some
of
them
have
come
up
on
the
bench
here.
what
if...
what
if
the
individual
in
fact
ducks
into
a...
runs
toward
a
building
which
is
a
known
crack
house?
i
mean,
there...
there
are
lots
of
little
details
that
come
into
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
that
might
make,
for
example,
the
stop
in
this
case
a
perfectly
good
terry
stop,
but
it
gives
one
pause
when
you
ask
us,
number
one,
to
depart
from
totality,
number
two,
to
come
up
with
a
bright
line
rule
in
which
there's
at
least
a
substantial
risk
of
a
lot
of
innocent
people
being...
being
caught.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we
don't
have
a
rule
that
says
anytime
anyone
flees
from
the
police,
there
is...
there
is
sufficient
suspicion
for
a
terry
stop.
we
don't
accept
that
rule.
and
in
fact,
that...
that's
even
narrower
than...
than
you're
arguing
for
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
question.
the
writer
of
proverbs
was
right,
but
we've
never
accepted
that
as
a
sufficient
test
in
and
of
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
stewart...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there...
what
do
you
make
of
the
slippery
slope
argument
that...
that
takes
the...
the
situation
one
step
further?
it
was
made
in
at
least
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
as
you
say,
the
police
certainly
can
properly
ask
a
question
of
anybody
on
the
street,
and
most
people
will
answer
the
question
or
at
least
not
behave
rudely.
if
the
petitioner's
petition...
position
is
accepted,
what
do
we
do
or
what
rule
would
we
have
in
the
case
in
which
the
individual
who
was
accosted
by
the
police
on
the
street
and
asked
a
question,
instead
of
answering
it
tells
the
officer
to
go
to
blazes
or
perhaps
something
stronger
than
that?
does
that...
is
that
going
to
be
the
equivalent
of
flight,
i.e.,
deviant
response,
and...
and
justify
a
terry
stop?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
language
is
extreme.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
argument.
you
are
not,
as
i
understand
it,
arguing
here
that
it
would
have
been
error
for
the
illinois
courts
to
say
under
terry
that
on
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
terry
stop
was
valid.
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
arguing
is
that
it
is
not
a
proper
basis
to
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
by
adopting
a
per
se
rule
that
flight
in
response
to
the
police
in
high
crime
is
per
se
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
whether...
whether
they...
whether
in
fact
this
was
or
was
not
a
good
terry
stop
is
not
really
the
issue
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it.
and
i
take
it
you
agree.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
you
came
up
here
to
argue.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you
came
here
to
argue
is
that
the
per
se
rule
is
a
wrong
reason
for
reversing
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
right?
