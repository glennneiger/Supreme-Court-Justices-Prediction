mr.
devine,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
my
experience,
your
experience.
is
there
any
evidence,
apart
from
intuition,
that
people
who
have
something
to
hide
run?
justice
souter
asked
the
question
about
how
many
innocent
people
are
in
jeopardy.
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
at
all
to
back
up
this
intuition
that
people
don't
run
unless
they
have
something
to
hide?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
have
this
case,
but
how
many
on
the
other
side
where
this
practice
is
followed?
how
many
innocent
people
get
stopped
because
they
sped
away?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
have
any
empirical
studies
of
this,
do
we?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that...
that's...
some
of
those
cases,
at
least,
involve
flight
after
an
accusation,
after
a
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought,
mr.
koch,
that
that
was
your
point.
i
thought
that
you
really
crossed
swords
on
that,
that
your
position
was
flight
in
and
of
itself
from
a
police
officer
is
not
enough,
and
mr.
devine's
position
is,
yes,
it
is
enough.
so,
he
is
arguing
for
a
bright
line
rule
and
he
was
very
candid
in
saying
when
you
have
these
three
factors,
that's
it.
you
don't
look
to
anything
else.
i
thought
your
position
was
flight
from
a
police
officer
is
not
enough.
you
must
have
corroborating
circumstances.
now,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia,
you
seem
to
be
backing
off
from
that,
but
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
scream
and
running
from
a
store.
what
else
would
be
corroborating
circumstances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
instead
of
running
off,
he
jumped
into
his
car
on
the...
it
was
parked
curbside...
and
sped
away?
