we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
98-1036,
illinois
v.
william
wardlow.
mr.
devine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
there
is
some
reference
in
the
illinois
court
opinions
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
high
crime
neighborhood.
does
that
bear
on
your
calculus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
devine,
your...
your
question
presented
is
whether
a
person's
sudden
and...
in
petition
for
certiorari,
whether
a
person's
sudden
and
unprovoked
flight
from
a
clearly
identifiable
police
officer
who
is
patrolling
a
high
crime
area
is
sufficiently
suspicious
to
justify
a
temporary
investigatory
stop
pursuant
to
terry
against
ohio.
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
so
much
like
a
request
for
a
bright
line
rule,
as
saying
do
these
circumstances
come...
satisfy
the
terry
case,
which
maybe
it's
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing.
but
i...
i
don't
read
that
necessarily
as
saying
that
you
believe
that
every
time
these
factors
coalesce,
there
will
be
a
cause
for
a
terry
stop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
individual
has
a
right
to
walk
away,
which
you
concede,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
devine.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
that
was
not
the
view
of
the
majority
in
terry.
justice
harlan
wrote
separately,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
adams
against
williams
certainly
refers
to
a
high
crime
neighborhood.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
stewart,
you
know,
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
empirical
testimony
in
these
cases
as
to
whether
something
had
become
the
norm
in
a
community.
you
have
to
be
a
little
more
categorical
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
bring
it
back
to
the
general
terry
test
again?
you
know,
this
may
be
a
presumptive
thing,
but
it
isn't
going
to
be
categorically
true
in
all
cases
that
these
three
factors
will
justify
the
terry
stop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
koch,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
i...
certainly
there
was
an
argument
that
this
sort
of
panicked
flight
is
enough.
what
more
should
the
officer
have
to
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
you're
saying
more
should
be
required,
but
there's
certainly
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
a
panicked
flight
is
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
think
the
argument
developed
on...
on
the
petitioner's
case
is
that
they
think
these
circumstances
generally
come
within
a
terry
stop
rule,
not
that
every
single
time
you
have
a
flight,
as
justice
scalia's
questions
indicate,
you're...
you're
going
to
have
a
basis
for
a
terry
stop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
it's
not
at
any
rate
or
any
speed.
surely,
you
realize
that
just
from
listening
to
the
argument.
it's
a
panicked
flight.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
mr.
koch,
the
question
presented,
whether
a
person's
sudden
and
unprovoked
flight
from
a
clearly
identifiable
police
officer,
who
is
patrolling
a
high
crime...
is
sufficiently
suspicious
to
justify
a
temporary
investigating
stop
under
terry.
now,
you
didn't
object
to
that.
you
didn't
say
the
court
couldn't
reach
that
question
in
your
brief
in
opposition,
did
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
was
that
your
position
was
that
really
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
could
have
been
wrong
in
this
case,
but
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
could
have
decided
this
case
otherwise.
it
could
have
decided
the
other
way,
but
that
your
position
was
we
simply
should
give
discretion
to
that...
them
in
reviewing
it.
now,
where
do
you
take
that
position
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question,
it
was
that
you're
not
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
couldn't
have
come
out
the
other
way
in
this
case.
in
effect,
it
could
have
come
out
either
way
and
we
shouldn't
review
it.
now,
where
do
you...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
would
have
been
wrong
in
the...
your
position
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
have
been
wrong
to
come
out
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
say
that.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
person's
sudden
and
unprovoked
flight
from
a
clearly
identifiable
police
officer,
and
you
didn't
question
that
question
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koch.
the
case
is
submitted.
