mr.
james
b.
koch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
simple
rule
will
not
cover
every
situation,
and
that's
why,
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion,
this
court
has
consistently
rejected
bright
line
rules,
emphasizing
a
case-by-case,
fact-specific
nature
on
a
reasonable
inquiry.
in
response
to
petitioner's
argument
with...
with
the
three
tests,
the
reason
flight
alone
or
flight
from
a
police
officer
without
provocation
cannot
in
every
situation
constitute
a
per
se
rule,
is
if
someone
doesn't
want
to
speak
with
the
police,
sees
them
coming,
and
walks,
skips,
jumps,
gets
on
his
bike,
or
get
in
a
car,
he
would
be
subjected
under
this
per
se
rule
to
a
terry
stop,
and
for
no
other
reason
than
he
didn't
want
to
speak
with
the
police
officers.
that's
why
the
illinois
supreme
court,
using
a
case-by-case
analysis
found
it
untenable
in
this
situation,
that
flight
in
every
situation
was
reasonably
suspicious.
mr.
james
b.
koch
well...
mr.
james
b.
koch
that
calls
into
question
then
or
calls
into
certainly
consideration
the
notion
of
what
is
flight,
and
that
is
as
descriptive
term
as
applied
by
the
police.
mr.
james
b.
koch
if
my
client
was
elderly,
saw
the
police
and
turned
on
his
walker
to
go
away,
that
might
be
slow
flight.
he
may
be
simply
trying
to
avoid
the
police
and
not
trying
to
escape
them.
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
i
would
agree.
and
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
case,
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
is
the
officer
merely
failed
to
articulate
what
is
it
about
that
non-criminal
activity,
the
flight,
the
avoidant
behavior,
that
was
suspicious
and
directed
the
officer's
attention.
mr.
james
b.
koch
the
officer
should
have
to
say
or
articulate
what
is
it
about
the
flight
that
caused
him
to
focus
on
this
particular
person
at
that
time.
was
there
a
scream?
was
he
running
from
a
store?
were
there...
mr.
james
b.
koch
there
is
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
panicked
flight
is
enough
in
a
case-by-case
basis.
they're
asking
for
a
per
se
rule
that
every
time
someone
sees...
mr.
james
b.
koch
on
every...
every
time
somebody
flees
then
from
the
police
without
provocation,
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
b.
koch
and...
and
i
would
say
that
it
sounds
like
or
smacks
of
a
per
se
test,
that
every
time
somebody
seeks
to
avoid
the
police
at
any
rate
or
any
speed
and
it
calls...
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
if
i
can
apply
it
to
this
case,
and
justice
souter's
comment,
in
this
particular
neighborhood...
though
we
would
disagree
it
is
a
high
crime
area,
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
it
was
on
a
de
novo
review...
but
it
would
make
perfect
sense
for...
if
you
see
four
police
cars
and
eight
police
officers
converging
on
a
scene
at
one
time,
that
one
person
might
duck
behind
a
car.
the
solicitor
general
would
call
that
aberrant
behavior.
others
might
flee
so
that
they...
they
aren't
subjected
to
gunfire,
maybe
being
called
as
a
witness,
being
interviewed.
and
again,
in
this
case,
it
makes
perfect
sense
because
my
client
left
the
scene,
went
around
an
alley
and
came
right
over
to
the
police.
he
came
back
to
them.
so,
it
might
be
that
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
would...
would
accordingly
react.
so,
it
wasn't
panicked.
it
was
a
reasoned
judgment
to
avoid
some
confrontation
between
the
police
and
whatever
it
was
that
called
four
cars
and
eight
police
officers
to
the
scene.
mr.
james
b.
koch
no,
i
don't,
your
honor,
but...
and
i
don't
know
that
you
would
be
sympathetic
either
to
those
who
don't
want
to
be
subject
to
misidentification
or
harassment,
those
who
don't
want
to
be
intimidated
in
the
area.
there
may
be
people
who...
who
don't
want
to
be
called
as
a
witness.
there
may
be
people
who
are
simply
intimidated
by
the
entire
nature
of
seeing
four
cars
and
eight
police
officers
converge
on
a
scene.
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
then
there
should
be,
as
i
understand
terry,
some
articulable
basis
for
stopping
that
person
who's
left.
something...
mr.
james
b.
koch
that
may
arouse
suspicion
in
context.
was
he
running
from
a
scream?
was
he
running
from
a
store?
mr.
james
b.
koch
flight
in
and
of
itself...
mr.
james
b.
koch
i
would
submit
it
is
suspicious
and
it's
a
hunch
that
something
is
amiss.
mr.
james
b.
koch
but
without
some
articulable
suspicion
of
what...
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
time,
context,
other
people
on
the
street.
if
it
was...
if
my
client
was
running
and
it
was
2:00
in
the
morning,
if
it
was
a
cold
winter's
day,
if
he
was
running
from
some...
the
police
officer,
heard
a
scream,
were
they
responding
in
the
neighborhood
to
some
response?
mr.
james
b.
koch
that
there
is
no
context...
there's
no
articulable
basis
by
the
police
of
what
it
is
that
called
my
attention
to
him
running.
i
saw
him
running.
yes,
that's
suspicious.
i
want
to
check
it
out.
i
could
surveill
him.
i
could
call
the...
the
station
and...
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
they
saw
him
running
from...
they
looked...
my
client
looked
in
their
direction...
mr.
james
b.
koch
and
then
ran.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
james
b.
koch
and
i
agree,
and
i
would
add
that
what
the...
mr.
james
b.
koch
justice
scalia,
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
was
what
was
untenable
was
there
were
no
articulable
facts
in
the
record
from
which
they
would
be
willing
to
tilt
in
this
situation
individual's
freedoms
in
favor...
whether
it's
per
se
or
totality,
in
favor
of
the
state.
mr.
james
b.
koch
it's
my...
mr.
james
b.
koch
no.
it
is
our
position
that
flight
in
and
of
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
stop
an
individual
on
the
street,
that
there
has
to
be
some
corroborating
circumstances
that
are
articulated
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
mr.
james
b.
koch
there
may
be
a
call
in
the
neighborhood
that
they're
responding
to.
it
may
be,
for
example,
under
a...
perhaps
a
reid
v.
georgia
analysis
that
nobody
else
fled
and
he's
the
only
person,
that
they're
responding
to
some
activity
that
they
see
someone
running
out
of
a
store.
there
may
be
a
whole
myriad.
really,
the
illinois
supreme
court
decision
is
really...
it's
democracy
promoting
in
the
sense
that
there's
an
endless
variety
of
circumstances,
coupled
with
flight.
mr.
james
b.
koch
no.
mr.
james
b.
koch
that
to
give
discretion
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
decision
in
review?
mr.
james
b.
koch
it's
my...
our
position
is
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
correctly
said
that
flight
in
and
of
itself
will
never
be
enough
absent
corroborating
circumstances,
and
they
will
not
adopt
a
per
se
test...
mr.
james
b.
koch
absent
corroborating
circumstances
or
articulable
suspicion,
that's
correct,
justice.
mr.
james
b.
koch
i
came
here...
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's...
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
koch
no,
i
have
not,
your
honor.
the
illinois
appellate
court
decision,
in
reviewing
the
record,
notes
that
there
was
one
sentence
that
says
he
fled
because
there's
high...
there's
high
narcotics
traffic
in
the
area
and...
and
found
the
record
too
vague
to
support
the
high
crime
area.
and
they
also
pointed
out
that
there
was
no...
nothing
articulated
by
officer
nolan
as
to
such
things
as
who
else
was
on
the
street.
were
there...
in
response
to...
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
koch
there's
nothing
in
the...
in
either
the
illinois
appellate
court
or
the
record
that
says
it's
provoked
or
unprovoked.
mr.
james
b.
koch
even
if
it
was
unprovoked
flight,
and...
and
that's
a
given,
it's
unprovoked
without
corroborating
circumstances
that
his
flight
was
related
to
some
criminal
activity.
and
the
per
se
rule
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
refused
to
adopt
was
just
that:
absent
some
corroborating
circumstance,
flight
alone
is
insufficient
were
it
otherwise,
what
is
left
to
fill
the
void
is
unparticularized
discretion,
unsubstantiated
hunches,
and
non-individualized
suspicion.
it's
my
understanding...
and
i
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
very
clear...
was
that
there
was
nothing
here
by
the
police
officer
to
articulate
what
is
it
about
the
flight
that
caused
it
to
be
suspicious.
mr.
james
b.
koch
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
b.
koch
absent
corroborating
circumstances
of
some
criminal
activity...
mr.
james
b.
koch
something
that...
that
colors
the
flight,
the
context.
mr.
james
b.
koch
it's
my
understanding
that
they're
saying
that
flight
from
a
police
officer
without
provocation
is
always
in
every
circumstance
grounds
for
a
terry
stop.
mr.
james
b.
koch
and...
mr.
james
b.
koch
and
i
would
submit
that
if
officer
nolan
in
that
situation
had
testified...
in
the
record,
it
does
say,
justice
breyer,
i
went
to
this
area
with
the
four
cars...
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's
the...
that's
where
he
sees
my
client.
but
what
he
says
is
because
of
number
of
people
and
customers
and
perhaps
lookouts,
and
in
the
situation
you
described,
if
officer
nolan
said
he
fled
and
i...
i
think
he
was
acting
as
a
lookout
or
i
think
he
was
coming
from
one
of
the
facts
in
minnesota
v.
dickerson...
mr.
james
b.
koch
i
think
in
your
hypothetical,
had
that
been
articulated,
that
may
very
well
constitute
reasonable
suspicion.
that
wasn't
articulated
in
this
case.
nothing
was
articulated.
thank
you.
mr.
james
b.
koch
i
think
i
would
take
the
same
position
that
we
have
the
right
to
eschew
interactions
with
the...
with
law
enforcement
or
the
government.
if
a
police
officer
were
to
walk
over
to
you,
you
can...
you
can
continue
walking,
walk
across
the
street,
get
on
your
bike.
and
certainly
the
manner
in
which
you
exercise
your
fourth
amendment
rights
shouldn't
be
bootstrapped
into
a
violation
of
them
and
cause
a
terry
stop
any
more
than
perhaps
if
mr.
bostick
had
said...
had
been
asked,
i'd
like
to
search
your
luggage,
and
he
says,
i
don't
want
to.
can
that
be
bootstrapped
into
a
search
of
his
luggage?
and
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
so,
there's
a
very
important
constitutional
point
here,
that
my
client
can
come
and
go
as
he
pleases
absent
some
objective
criteria
that
he's
engaged
in
criminal
behavior.
so,
yes,
you
can
get
on
your
bike,
get
in
the
car,
walk
away,
absent
something
articulated
by
the
police
that
causes
him
to
be
stopped,
which
is
absent
from
this
record.
mr.
james
b.
koch
in
a...
that
may
be
with
other
factors,
it
may
be
there's
some.
but
i
would
submit
that
flight
alone...
mr.
james
b.
koch
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
grounds
for
a
terry
stop.
if
the
police
officer
says,
i'd
like
to
search
your
luggage,
he
takes
his
bag
and...
and...
mr.
james
b.
koch
on
the
grounds
that
the
manner
in
which
you
exercise
your
rights
shouldn't
constitute
a
violation
of
it.
thank
you.
