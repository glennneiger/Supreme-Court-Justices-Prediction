well,
you
want
some
per
se
rule,
it
sounds
like,
rather
than
what
we
have
normally
done
on
a
terry
stop,
which
is
inquire
whether
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
you
reject
that
as
the
test?
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
in...
in...
in
this
case,
there
may
well
be
special
circumstances
that
would
enter
the
mix.
the
officer
was
going
to
a
building
that
the
officers
thought
was
the
location
for
a
lot
of
drug
trafficking.
and
presumably
we
have
circumstances
here
where
the...
where
the
person
who
ran
had
seen
that
it
was
a
police
officer
following
that
person,
and
so
that's
different
from
a
flight
where
the
person
doesn't
even
know
there's
a
police
officer...
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
your
experience...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
just
walking
fast
won't
do
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
do...
do
you
propose
some
per
se
rule,
as
mr.
devine
was
arguing,
or
are
you
advising
us
to
stick
with
the
terry
reasonable
suspicion/
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
saying
that
there's...
is
there
a
right
of
an
individual
to
go
their
own
way
even
though
there's
a
police
officer
known
to
be
on
the
scene?
can
you
walk
away
rapidly?
can
you
just
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them?
