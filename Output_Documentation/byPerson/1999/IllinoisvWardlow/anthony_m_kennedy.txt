justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
said
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
there
was
a
problem,
you
mean
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
crime
was
afoot.
is
that
the
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
would
justify
a
terry
stop?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
your...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
does
provocation...
i
know
the
genesis
of
the
phrase,
but
why
is
provocation
important?
and,
incidentally,
why
wasn't
this
provocation
when
four
cars
come
swooping
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
does
provocation
add
to
the
mix?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
threatened
him
with
what?
i'm
going
to
beat
you
up
or...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
police
officer
and
his
colleagues
go
to
the
area
and
swoop
down
in
order
to
cause
some
people
to
flee
and
then
stop
them.
is
that
unprovoked
in
your...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
definition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
which
way
do
you
come
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
provoked?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your...
your
brief
mentioned
the
fact
it
was
a
high
crime
area,
and
that
seems
to
have
dropped
out
of
your
argument
really.
and
i
suppose
if
the
police
see
somebody
running
in
a
very
elegant
neighborhood
near
the
country
club,
it's
just
as
suspicious.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
prompted
by
the
police.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
the
luggage
case,
in
response
to
the
police
request,
the
man
takes
his
luggage
and
starts
to
run.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
just
the...
just
the
simple
flight.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
he
is
innocent
of
any
activity,
of
any
criminal
activity?
