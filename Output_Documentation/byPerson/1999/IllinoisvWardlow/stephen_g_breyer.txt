what
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
he
have
to
have
some
rough
idea
of
what
kind
of
crime?
i
mean,
it
wasn't
money
laundering
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr....
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
about
the
argument
that...
well,
there
are
some
neighborhoods,
high
crime
neighborhoods
in
particular,
where
people
are
afraid
of
the
police?
maybe
the
police
just
stop
people
randomly
and
search
them,
and
there
can
be
a
racial
element
involved,
a
white
policeman
in
a
black
neighborhood.
say,
that
in
that
neighborhood,
people
are
frightened
of
the
police
and
they
run
away.
they
just
don't
want
to
get
involved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying...
i'm
saying
what...
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
going
to
frisk
the
person,
doesn't
the
policeman
have
to
have
at
least
some
notion
of
what
kind
of
a
crime
this
person
might
have
committed.
justice
harlan
said
in
terry
that
to
frisk
him,
you'd
have
to
have...
that
the
reason
for
the
stop
is
an
articulable
suspicion
of
a
crime
of
violence.
so,
if
we
have
no
idea
what
kind
of
crime
is
at
stake...
he
just
runs...
what's
the
ground
for
frisking
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
disagree
with
justice
harlan's
articulation
of
the
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
ran.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
that's
your
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
win
on
that...
if
you
win
on
that,
what
about
running
away
under
these
circumstances?
suppose
it
also
was
from
a
20-foot
area
in
front
of
a
building
that
the
police
knew
was
commonly
used
for
narcotics
sales
that
often
had
many
people,
including
lookouts,
customers,
and
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
right
in
front
of
the
storefront
which
everyone
knows
is
the
storefront
where
on
a
daily
basis
they
sell
narcotics.
and
you
go
to
that
20-foot
square
storefront,
and
there's
somebody
standing
right
in
front
of
it
and
people
run
away.
and
he
looks
at
the
policeman,
runs
away.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't...
it
seems...
maybe
it's
a
little
ambiguous,
but
it
seems
to
say
4035
roosevelt
avenue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
what
about
my...
my
hypothetical
rather
than
yours?
