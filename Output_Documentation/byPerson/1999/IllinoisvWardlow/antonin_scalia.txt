justice

i
suppose
if
a
policeman
sees
somebody
with
a
smoking
rifle,
he
wouldn't
exactly
know
what
precise
crime
was...
was
probable
or
possible
either.
the
man
might
have
killed
somebody
or
he
might
have
shot
a
bald
eagle.
you
really
wouldn't
know
which,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
darned
good
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
yet
we
haven't.
have
you
accepted...
justice
antonin
scalia
have...
have
you
accepted
the
premise
that...
that
normally
when
the
police
show
up,
all
of
the
neighbors
run
away?
i...
my
experience
has
been
just
the
opposite,
that
the
police
have
to
keep
the
crowd
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
curiosity
tends
to
cause
people
to
hang
around
as
soon
they
see
a
couple...
gee,
what's
going
on
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
this
case
for
starters.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
devine,
do
we
have
any
empirical
studies
about...
empirical
studies
about
how
often,
when
there's
been
somebody
killed
and
somebody
nearby
has
blood
on
his
hands,
that
person
is
likely
to
have
been
involved
in
the
killing?
are
there
any
empirical
studies
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
it
might
be
good
patrolling
practices
i
suppose
and
stop
innocent
citizens
from
being
subjected
to
terry
stops
more
often
than
they
otherwise
would
if
a
police
officer,
seeing...
or
a
couple
of
police
officers
seeing
a...
some
suspicious
individual
said,
let's
walk
over
towards
them
and...
and...
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
it's
suspicious
enough
for
a
terry
stop
now,
but
let's
see
if
they
run.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
they
approach,
they
do
run
and
the
police
officers
then
stop
them.
that
would
seem
to
me
pretty
good
police
practice.
wouldn't
it
seem
so
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
power
walking.
what
about
power
walking?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
an
elderly...
from
an
elderly
and
overweight
police
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
devine,
what
happens
to
these
people
when
they
run?
are
they
arrested?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
it
would
be
more
suspicious.
i
mean,
somebody
may
be
running
away
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
because
he
doesn't
believe
that
the
person
is
a
policeman,
whereas
in
a
low
crime
neighborhood,
you
know,
surrounded
by
honest
people,
this
must
be
a
policeman.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
could...
there
could
be
a
lot
of
elses,
though,
besides
mere
provocation,
couldn't
there?
i
mean,
there...
there
were
instances
a
few
years
ago
in
the
washington
area
in
which
some
man
was...
was
posing
as
a
policeman
in
a...
in
a
police
car
with
a...
put
a
red
light
up
on
top
of
the
car
and
stopped
women
and
robbed
and
raped
them.
now,
what
if
something
like
that
has
been
going
on
and
a
woman
is
driving
along
in
a
car
and
there
is
a
real
policeman,
plain
clothes,
he
puts
a
red
light
up
and
she
takes
off
fast?
now,
would
you
call
that
provocation?
i
would
hardly
call
it
provocation,
but
there
would
be
good
reason
for
her
to
take
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
test
is
not
whether
the
individual
was
reasonable
in
fly...
in
fleeing,
but
whether
the
policeman
should
have
realized
that
the...
that
the
fleeing
does
not
necessarily
connote
guilt.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
goes
too
far.
i
mean,
it
isn't
walk,
skip,
ride
a
bike,
or
whatever.
it
has
to
be
departing...
as
i
understand
the
test
proposed,
departing
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
make
it
clear
that
he's
trying
to
escape
the
police,
a
panicked
departure...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
prevent
the
police
from
catching
up
with
him,
in
such
manner
as
to...
as
to
prevent
the
police
from
catching
up
with
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
where
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
comes
in.
i
mean,
none
of
these
things
can
be...
can
be
applied
without
some
judgment
in
the
particular
context,
which
depends
upon
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
really
sympathetic
to...
to
those
who...
who
run
away
because
they
don't
want
to
be
called
as
a
witness.
i
mean,
you
think
that's...
out
of
sympathy
for
that
class
of
people,
we
should
refuse
to
adopt
this
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
indeed.
i
mean,
nobody
contends
that
every
time
a
police
officer
conducts
a
terry
stop,
it's
a
guilty
person.
the
innocent
are
going
to
be
caught
up
in...
in
the
necessary
procedure
of...
of
assuring
the
safety
of
the
streets.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
think
it's
an
articulable
basis
that
a
police
officer
is
patrolling
a
beat.
there's
somebody
on
the
other
side.
he
does
a
double
take.
he
sees...
he
looks
again
and
starts
running
in
panic.
that...
that
does
not
arouse
any
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
he's
running
from
the
policeman.
he
is
clearly
running
from
the
policeman.
you
seriously
contend
that
that
does
not
arouse
any
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
unprovoked.
he's
fleeing
in
panic
from
a
policeman.
now,
there
may
be
other
circumstances
that...
that
could
come
in,
but
absent
those
other
circumstances,
which
i
don't
see
here...
what
are
the
other
circumstances
here
that...
that
deprive
that...
that
flight
of
its...
of
its
normal...
what
i
would
consider
its...
its
normal
purport?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
could
have
worse.
it
could
have
been
more
suspicious.
i
don't
deny
that,
but
what
makes
the
flight
less
suspicious
than
normal
flight
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
didn't
just
see
him
running.
they...
they
saw
him
running
from
the
police.
i
mean,
this
was
not
a
jogger.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
really.
you
are
not
really
agreeing
because
you
are
not
really
saying
that...
in
response
to
my
questions,
you...
you
indicated
that
you
have
no
factors
that
you
can
bring
forward
on
the
other
side.
i
mean,
we
don't
have
to
have
a
per
se
rule
in
order
to
say
unless
there
are
some
factors
which
otherwise
explain
it
to
the
reasonable
police
officer,
unprovoked
flight,
upon
seeing
a
police
officer,
is
enough
to
satisfy
terry.
that's
not
a
per
se
rule.
it's
just
that
there
are
no
factors
on
the
other
side.
and
you
don't
assert
there
are
any
in
this
case,
or
at
least
you
haven't
told
me
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
that
they
are
unwilling
to
consider
flight
from
a
police
officer
suspicious,
and
that's
really
what
all
of
this
debate
is
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
haven't
conceded
it,
you
should
have
objected
to
the
question
presented.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
didn't
really
think
we
were
going
to
get
into
the
facts
of
this
case
as
to
whether,
indeed,
it
was
an
unprovoked
flight.
i
thought
that
was
a
given
and
you...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
have
raised
that
point
earlier.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
what...
what
we
have
before
us
is...
is
that
question
and...
and
we
assume
an
unprovoked
flight.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
koch,
i...
i'm...
i
don't
think
that...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
in
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
your
opponents
here
are
not
arguing
for
a
categorical
position,
that
it
is
you
who
are
arguing
for
the
categorical
position.
you
say
that
unprovoked
flight
alone
can
never
be
enough.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
other
side,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
arguing
that
unprovoked
flight
alone
is
often
enough...
is
always
enough.
they're
saying
it
can
be
enough,
which
is
what
the
illinois
court
denied.
they...
they...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
they
acknowledged
that
there
are
other
circumstances
which
would
show...
which
would
show
that...
that
there
was
reason
for
the
flight.
and
if...
if
the
policeman
was
aware
of
the
reason
for
the
flight,
then
they...
they
wouldn't
think
there
was
basis
for
a
terry
stop.
