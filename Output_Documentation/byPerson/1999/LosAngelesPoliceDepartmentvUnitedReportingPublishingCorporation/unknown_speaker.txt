unknown
speaker
where
is
this
in
your
brief,
mr.
goldstein?
unknown
speaker
3a?
okay,
thanks.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
respondent
just
publish
this
in
a
little
newspaper
format
and
claim
a
journalistic
exception?
unknown
speaker
so
the
statute
permits
the
automatic
release
of
the
name
of
an
individual.
it's
just
his
current
address
that
can't
be
given?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
jail
mail
register
that's
in
the
record,
isn't
that
an
illustration
of
what
looks
like
a
newspaper
but
really
has
a
mailing
list,
or--
unknown
speaker
--so
if
the
purpose
controls,
then
assume
this
hypothetical.
an
attorney
goes
to
lunch
with
the
publisher
of
the
los
angeles
times
or
the
san
francisco
chronicle.
he
says,
you
know,
it's
really
very
helpful
that
you're
printing
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
people
who
have
been
arrested
for
drunk
driving,
because
i
use
that
to
solicit,
or
to
give
alcohol
counseling
or
something.
i
take
it
henceforward
under
the
statute
the
newspaper
could
not
publish
those
names
because
it's
being
used
indirectly
for
that
purpose.
unknown
speaker
are
you
referring
to
a
specific
section
of
the
statute
now?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
not
going
to
be
used
by
that
person.
unknown
speaker
but
that
statute
doesn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
among
political...
permitted
purposes
is
political,
and
i
think
i
have
some
idea
of
what
these
others
encompass,
journalism,
scholarly,
but
what
is
political?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
state
statute,
mr.
goldstein,
or
an
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
not
totally
clear
on
your
explanation.
are
you
saying
that
when
someone
gets
the
information
and,
say,
lists
30
people,
as
i
see
on
page...
whatever
this
is,
page
4
of
the
record,
there's
a
big
list
of
names
and
addresses,
that
what
he
has
to
promise
is
that
his
purpose
in
listing
all
these
names
and
addresses
and
sending
a
piece
of
paper
with
that
list
to
various
people
who
pay,
he
has
to
promise
that
his
purpose
is
not
to
get
paid
for
the
list?
unknown
speaker
so
does
the
product
or
service
mean,
in
other
words,
i
who
print
this
paper
know
that
people
want
to
get
lists
of
names
and
addresses
of
victims--
unknown
speaker
--and
therefore
i
will
sell
them
this
list,
and
i
put
a
few
articles
in
as
a
kind
of
cover-up.
is
that
the
idea?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
had
the
statute
never
been
construed
by
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
ninth
circuit
go
about
interpreting
it,
if
there
had
been
no
state
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
so
what's
new?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
there's
a
different
in
being
nosy
and
being
political?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
read
through
this
list
of
all
the
people
who
had
been
arrested
in
sacramento.
i
didn't
know
any
of
them.
[laughter]
what
if
a
newspaper
had
a
different
policy
from
the
one
that
you
tell
us
prevails,
and
simply
did
publish
this
information
as
a
matter
of
course,
and
every
day
a
reporter
went
down
and
requested
it
and
got
an
accurate
list
and
so
on,
and
the
paper
published
it.
would
the
paper
be
in
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
we've
got
to
work
with
what
we've
got
here.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
the
paper
simply
publishes
this
in
one
section
of
its
regular
edition,
every
day,
a
complete
listing.
would
it
be
in
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
not,
because
when
it
made
out
its
affidavit,
it
would
know
perfectly
well,
assuming
the
statute
remained
in
its
present
form,
that
individuals
such
as
the
respondent
here
would
use
the
information
and
in
any
event
would
know
that
the
purveyors
of
services
would
use
the
information,
so
how
could
it
make
out
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it
journalistic
to
provide
information
to
people
who
are
interested
in
communicating
with
arrestees
and
victims?
why
isn't
that
at
the
core
of
journalism?
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
have
to
identify
your
journalism
by
the
generality
of
the
publication.
if
somebody
puts
it
in
a...
if
the
los
angeles
times
puts
a
separate
section
of
this
in
its
paper,
surrounded
by
world
news
and
state
news
and
so
on,
it's
okay,
but
a...
an
individual
who
claims
to
be
a
journalist
only
with
the
more
limited
audience
that
your
alternative
hypo
of
the
lawyer's
paper
and
so
on
published,
that,
in
fact,
would
run
afoul
of
this?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that
only
a
police
blotter
is
journalistic?
i
think
those
who
have
trade
publications
are
journalists.
for
a
narrower
audience,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
somehow...
journalism
does
not
include
all
of
the
press?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
press
is
broken
down
into
little
subsets.
i
mean,
if
a
trade
journal
is
using
these
names
to
sell
the
trade
journal,
just
as
a
general
circulation
newspaper
is
putting
the
names
on
the
police
blotter
down
in
order
to
sell
the
newspaper,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
the
two
situations.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
--newspapers
aren't
trying
to
educate
the
public.
they're
trying
to
sell
newspapers.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
court?
i
notice
there's
been
a
change
in
counsel
up
here
and
so
forth.
did
the...
your
client
take
the
position
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
central
hudson
test
did
not
apply
at
all?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
make
the
basic
argument
you're
making
now,
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
what
does
central
hudson
have
to
do
with
our
access
cases?
i
think
if
you
assume
that
central
hudson
applies,
you're
assuming
it's
an
abridgement
of
speech
case
rather
than
a
denial
of
access
case.
unknown
speaker
and
what
of
our
cases
ever
said
central
hudson
applies
to
an
access
case?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
agree
below
that
central
hudson
was
the
test.
it
seems
to
me
they
therefore
were
not
even
claiming
it
was
not
an
access
case,
or
that
it
was
an
access
case.
unknown
speaker
i
now
see
how
they
got
into
this,
and
i...
i
read
the
last
sentence
on
4a,
where,
to
think
that
at
its
heart
was
case
1,
not
case
2.
now,
this
is
case
1.
i
am
not
a
journalist.
i
am
a
businessman,
and
my
business
is
to
sell
addresses
of
victims
to
people
who
will
pay
me
for
such
a
list.
i've
never
published
a
newspaper
or
anything
that
looks
like
a
newspaper
in
my
life.
i
thought
that
was
at
the
heart
of
this
provision,
and
i
thought
secondarily
was
in
the
provision
somebody
who
advertises
for
my
product.
now,
you're
saying
that
it's
the
second
case
that
this
is
about,
and
you
don't
care
about
the
first
case.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
i
must
also
execute
an
affidavit,
must
i
not--
unknown
speaker
--that
i
am
not
going
to,
as
an
enforcement
device,
i,
or...
the
language
covers
it
only
awkwardly,
but
i
who
want
to
sell
to
other
people
addresses
of
victims
and
have
never
published
a
newspaper
must
execute
that
declaration
that
i
am
not...
want
the
information
to
sell
a
product
or
service,
namely
my
product
or
service
that
i've
just
described.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i've
now
pushed
you
into
this,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
that
wasn't
what
this
case
was
about.
i
mean,
is
this
case,
or
is
the
statute
about
my
heartland
case
of
a
person
who's
not
a
journalist
but
wants
to
sell
addresses
of
victims
to
other
people?
or
is
the
statute
about
something
that
looks
like
a
newspaper
and
advertises...
you
know,
you
can
also
get
more
addresses?
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
the
distinction
that
the
government's
brief
makes
between
what
i
think
it
called
an
intrinsic
speech
content
on
the
one
hand
and
information
which
is
useful
only
for
some
purpose,
e.g.
in
this
case
finding
targets
for
solicitation?
do
you
accept
that
distinction,
and
does
your
case
rest
upon
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that...
your
argument
for
that
is
that
it's
part
of
a
commercial
enterprise,
right?
isn't
that
why?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
information
is
a
commodity
to
the
new
york
times.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
that
is
so.
one
of
the
things
the
new
york
times
publishes
are
the
names
of
public
officials
who
are
doing
things.
that
is
not,
that
i
can
see,
analytically
different
from
publishing
the
name
of
somebody
who
has
just
run
a
red
light
and
gotten
pinched
for
it.
what
is
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
respondent
ever
claimed
to
be
a
journalist?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
one
of
the
reasons
why...
i
mean,
we've
got
to
make
a...
basically
a
category
judgment,
whether
it's
an
access
restriction
or
whether
it's
a
speech
restriction,
and
one
of
the
reasons
upon
which
we
may
make
that
categorization,
it
seems,
is
the
reason
behind
my
question.
so
simply
to
say,
well,
this
is
an
access
case,
i
think
begs
the
question.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
dumont,
could
i
follow
on
the
question
just
asked,
because
it
just...
for
me,
it
is
difficult
to
view
this
as
an
access
case
rather
than
a
speech
restriction
case
once
you
have
a
provision
in
the
law
that
says
that
journalists
can
obtain
the
information.
i
mean,
that
in
effect
is
saying
this
information
can
go
out
to
the
public
at
large.
there
is
no
attempt
to
limit
the...
you
know,
as
there
would
be
in
a
need-to-know
situation,
where
certain
information
is
only
given
to...
state
secrets
and
so
forth.
that
seems
to
me
an
access
restriction.
but
once
you
give
it
to
a
newspaper
you're
saying
the
whole
world
can
know
this.
how
can
you
possibly
think
this
is
an
access
restriction?
unknown
speaker
but
somebody
who
reads
the
l.a.
times
can
use
them
for
all
of
those
commercial
purposes.
unknown
speaker
could
the
government,
or
could
the
state
pass
a
statute
which
said,
we
have...
anyone
can
get
access
to
this
information,
but
it's
a
felony
if
you
use
it
for
any
purpose
other
than
scholarly,
journalistic,
political,
governmental?
unknown
speaker
so
what
do
you
do
with
my
statute?
i'm
not
quite
clear
where
you
come
out
on
my...
you
say
it's
probably
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
only
if
it
applies
to
the
press?
i
don't...
is
there
some
special
status
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment?
i--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
so
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
of
any,
and
it
seems
to
me
joe
six
pack
can
do
anything
with
the
information
that
the
press
ought
to
be
able
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
point
of
justice
kennedy's...
he
wasn't
talking
about
tricking.
he
was
talking
about
saying,
everybody
can
have
the
information,
but
you
can
only
use
it
for
particular
purposes.
is
that
really
any
different
from
this
law,
because
when
you
say
the
press
can
have
it
you
say
anybody
can
have
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
can
only
use
it
for
certain
purposes.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
condition
subsequent
on
the
use
of
information
that's
in,
within
a
wide
domain.
i've
just
never
seen
a
case--
unknown
speaker
--like
this,
either
for
you
or
against
you,
i
must
admit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dumont,
could
a
state
in
a
kqed
type
situation
say,
we're
going
to
give
investigative
journalists
access
to
our
prisoners
to
interview
them,
but
nobody
else?
i
mean,
the
notion
that
you
can't
give
something
to
the
press...
if
you
give
it
to
them,
you
have
to
give
it
to
everybody,
how
would
it
work
in
that
context,
if
the
state
is
not
obliged
to
do
this,
but
decided
it
wanted
to
let
investigative
journalists
have
interviews
with
prisoners,
but
nobody
else?
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
thing,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
there
a
difference?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--i've
sat
in
courts...
i
mean,
trial
courts
a
lot
of
the
time
and
i...
people
come
before
the
courts
for
arraignment,
and
i
don't
know
that
their
addresses
are
mentioned,
so
that
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
practical
way
that,
en
masse,
this
kind
of
information
really
could
be
obtained
unless
it's
obtained
from
the
police.
maybe
there
is,
but
i...
so
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
the
practical
effect
of
this
may
be
the
same
thing
as
an
absolute
denial.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
my
question?
what
about
the
names
of
these
people?
is
there
a
practical
way
to
get
this
information
en
masse,
except
by
getting
it
the
prohibited
way?
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
a
prohibition
on
a
form
of
commercial
speech.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
practical
effect
of
it,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
i
think...
and
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
but
i
think
you
are
conceding
that
the
argument
that
they
can
use
it
if
they
get
it
from
any
other
source
really
does
not
meet
the
objection,
because
the
objection
is
that
there
is
a
category
of
commercial
speech
which
in
fact
is
being
prohibited
by
the
prohibition
on
this
source
of
supply,
and
i
think
you
agreed
that
in
practical
terms
that
argument
is
true,
sound.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
i
mean,
are
you
conceding
that
this...
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
maybe
it's
obvious...
skip
it.
the
light's
on.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
ennis,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
not
only
concede...
contend
that
the
limitations
here
on
potential
use
are
bad
under
the
constitution,
but
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
could
not,
consistently
with
the
constitution,
have
withheld
this
information
from...
have
refused
this
information
to
everybody.
unknown
speaker
then
i
gather
pages
35
through
49
of
your
brief
were
not
really
essential.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
ennis,
may
i
stop
you
at
that
first
point,
because
if
you
regard
this
case
as
one
where
there
is
no
right
of
access
at
all,
unless
the
government
chooses
to
give
it,
then
the
government's
choice
to
give
it
to
some
is
increasing
speech
where
there
would
have
been
none
before,
so
i
think
it's
really
important
to
address
the
chief's
question.
are
we
to
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
government
could
say,
nobody
gets
this
information?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
directly.
could
the
government
say,
nobody
is
going
to
be
given
the
addresses
of
crime
victims,
period?
unknown
speaker
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
a
pure
access
issue?
unknown
speaker
under
what
holding
of
this
court?
i
mean,
this
is
a
far-out
argument,
and
i
want
to
know--
unknown
speaker
--how
you
back
that
up.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
victimless--
unknown
speaker
--in
what
case...
do
you
cite
them?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that
wasn't
access
to
the
information.
unknown
speaker
well,
before
you
get
to
the
second,
i'm
stuck
on
the
first.
that
is,
is
my
case
1...
you
remember
my
case
1?
it
was
simply
the
person
who
sells
information.
unknown
speaker
no,
no--
--i
don't
remember
his
case
1.
[laughter]
i'm
not
repeating--
would
you
give
me
his
case
1?
i'm
not
repeating
my
own
question.
what
i
wanted
to
know
is--
--is
that
commercial
speech?
i
mean,
i'm
thinking
that
probably
three-quarters
of
the
gross
national
product
consists
of
businesses
selling,
in
part
at
least,
pieces
of
paper
that
have
words
on
them,
and
i
want
to
know
if,
in
your
opinion,
all
of
that
counts
as
commercial
speech.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
that
isn't,
why
is
my
case
1?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i'm
talking
about
my
case
1.
it
is
a
facial
challenge,
as
i
said.
i
thought
it
was
aimed
at
case
1,
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
mean
that
this
is
a
speech
case--
unknown
speaker
--other
than
an
access
case?
unknown
speaker
well--
--it's--
--under
your
view
the
telephone
book
would
be
commercial
speech,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
what
case--
unknown
speaker
--what
case
would
you
cite
for
the
proposition
that
once
the
information
is
within
a
wide
domain
there
can
be
no
restrictions
on
its
use?
what
case
would
you
cite?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
sensible
enough,
but
i
can't
think
of
a
case.
unknown
speaker
except
one
was
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
this
isn't.
unknown
speaker
that
case
held
that
the
restriction
was
perfectly
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
have
you
got
one
that
says
the
restriction
is
not
okay?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
so
here,
when
the
purpose
put
forward
is,
we
want
to
shelter
these
people
not
simply
from
the
bombardment,
but
from
the
real
risk
that
these
records
are
going
to
be
used
to
deny
them
employment?
the
state
is
not
just
saying,
we
don't
like
solicitors.
it's
saying
that
we
want
to
protect
this
class
of
people
who
are
vulnerable.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
satisfactory
reason?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
scarce
resource,
because
the
lawyers
who
are
chasing
clients
can't
get
them
without
the
address
information.
unknown
speaker
is
the
freedom
of
information
act
also
subject
to
first
amendment
review
if
not
constitutionally
required,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
i
mean
it
seriously.
that
is
to
say,
on
your
opinion...
in
your
view
of
what
the
government
has
to
do
whenever
it
gives
out
information,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer.
but
i--
would
we
now
have
to
start--
unknown
speaker
--applying
first
amendment
standards--
unknown
speaker
--to
all
the
exceptions
in
the
freedom
of
information
act?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure...
are
there
exceptions
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
insofar
as
who
can
get
the
information
is
concerned?
i
think
there
may
have
been--
unknown
speaker
--one
recently
enacted
involving
foreign
espionage
services,
or
something.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
exception
i
know
of.
unknown
speaker
it's
mine,
too.
unknown
speaker
there
are
exceptions
as
to
what
information
must
be
given
out.
unknown
speaker
it's
filled
with
exceptions,
in
fact--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
suppose
you
might
try
to
distinguish
among
them,
but
do...
i
don't
know
if
you
want
to
pursue
this
further.
unknown
speaker
justice
ginsburg
raised
a
question
that's
i
think
important,
with
her
example
of
limited
access
to
prison.
suppose
the
police
department
said,
the
only
people
that
can
get
access
to
this
information
are
law
professors,
professors
involved
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
clinical
psychologists,
and
sociologists
for
scholarly
purposes,
and
then
your
people
wanted
the
information,
what
result
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
true
in
went
for
it,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
nonetheless
a
suppression
of
speech.
unknown
speaker
in
went
for
it,
it
was
a
suppression
of
speech.
you
say
it
was
limited,
and
of
course
that
was
one
of
the
justifications,
but
it
was
a
suppression
of
speech.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
--because--
--it
was
protecting
the
interests...
it
was
protecting
the
persons
who
would
otherwise
receive
the
speech.
the
same
thing
here.
you've
got
the
arrestees,
they
don't
want
to
have
the
lawyers
soliciting
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't--
--since
when
do
we
have
a
trial
of
the
facts
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute?
i
mean,
you
say
the
state
can't
advance
a
reason
if
you
could
show
in
court
that
there's...
something
else
is
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
because
california
chose
to
do
that.
they
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--only
if
you
say
access
must
be
available
to
everybody.
if
you
took
that
part
of
your
case,
the
rest
would
be
easy.
if
you
don't
take
that
part
of
the
case,
that
is,
everybody
is
entitled
to
access,
then
it
becomes
a
much
harder
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
protection
of
crime
victims?
it
also
deals
with
addresses
of
victims
of
crimes,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
the
statute
is
valid
as
to
the
limitation
on
addresses
of
crime
victims?
unknown
speaker
can
the
newspapers
get
that,
the
addresses
of
crime
victims?
unknown
speaker
what
about--
--then
i
would
think
you
would
challenge
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
only--
unknown
speaker
--that's
only
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
this
is
a
regulation
of
speech,
rather
than
a
denial
of
access.
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
suppose
i
assume
everything
in
your
favor
so
far,
which
i'm
not
saying
i
am,
but
i
mean,
suppose
i
did.
let's
get
to
the
question
of
the
state's
reasons.
what's
wrong
with
them
saying,
you
know,
there's
issue
of
privacy.
privacy.
that's
why
we
don't
want
people
to
have
this
information?
now,
we
see
some
important
countervailing
interest,
a
first
amendment
interest
for
the
free
press,
we
see...
and
we
think
those
are
very
important
interests,
studies,
governmental
interests,
crime
control.
but
obviously,
we
want
no
one
to
have
it
for
reasons
of
privacy,
and
without
those
very
important
exceptions
we're
going
to
keep
it.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
if
somebody
was
going
to
send
my
name
and
address
around
to
40
million
people,
my
privacy
was
far
more
invaded
than
if
three
just
happened
to
find
out
about
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
practical
terms
it's
not.
the
address--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
there's--
--but
the
addresses,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
getting
mail,
it's
a
question
of
people
staking
out
your
house,
and
finding
out
where
you
live.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they
don't
find
that
from
newspapers
in
the
state
generally.
it
may
be
that
every...
if
every
state
went
to
the
practice
that
obtains
in
sacramento,
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument,
because
nothing
would
be
advanced
by
this
prohibition.
but
in
the
world
that
it
exists
now,
at
least
outside
of
sacramento,
it
seems
to
me
it's
hard
to
argue
that
it
does
not
have
a
substantial
advancement
of
the
stated
interest.
unknown
speaker
but
the
state's
argument...
and
i
mean,
you're
right
if
you
accept
the
premise,
but
the...
i
think
the
state's
assumption
is
that
you
don't
get
a
letter,
you
get
a
whole
slew
of
letters.
you
get
letters
from
lawyers,
you
get
them
from
social
workers,
from
alcohol
and
drug
abuse
counselors
and
so
on,
and
it
kind
of
drives
you
crazy,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
speak
of
privacy,
but
we're
really
sort
of
speaking
of
annoyance
and
harassment--
unknown
speaker
--and
is
that
not
in
the
government
interest?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
there's
a
public
interest
in
reducing
the
volume
of
that
stuff?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
about
opt
in?
i
mean,
i
was
struck
in
the
brief
that
says,
well,
if
the
arrestee
is
really
worried
about
improper
use
of
this,
say
in
future
employment,
at
the
moment
of
arrest
he
can
check
off
the
box,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
really
interested
in
recognizing
that
interest,
you
would
say,
opt
in.
if
you
want
to
get
this
kind
of
stuff
from
the
lawyers
and
everything,
opt
in,
but
unless
you
affirmatively
opt
in,
we
are
going
to
spare
you
the
invasion
of
privacy,
the
potential
for
misuse
of
this
information
to
curtail
your
opportunities.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
do
you
think
an
opt
in
would
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
we're
talk...
i
mean,
i'm
a
little
worried
about
the
fact
that
these
are
people
arrested
for
crimes.
i
don't
know
that
we're
talking
about
junk
mail
at
all,
and
i
don't
know
that
in
a
serious
case
that's
the
concern,
and
it
might
well
be
that
in
cases
that
are
quite
serious,
and
addresses
are
very
important
for
reasons
other
than
junk
mail,
the
newspapers
would
act
in
a
manner
that
the
police
department
would
consider
"responsible",
but
commercial
enterprises
might
continue.
now,
that
seems
a
possible
analysis.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
ennis,
that
was--
unknown
speaker
--you
cite
cases
where
i
have
the
information
and
the
government's
saying,
you
can't
publish
it.
this
is
quite
different,
where
i
say,
i
don't
have
the
information.
first,
the
government
has
to
give
it
to
me,
and
then
i
will
speak
with
it.
so
i
don't
see
that
those
cases
are
on
four,
or
all
four,
where
the
government
is
prohibiting
you
from
publishing
what
you
have,
where
you
say,
first,
government,
give
it
to
me,
and
then
after
you
give
it
to
me,
i'll
publish
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
also
said
that
there's
no
right
of
access,
and
it
cited
zemel.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
can
i...
will
you
tell
me
what
you
understand
by
journalism?
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
you
accepted
his
assumption
that
journalistic
use
would
be
presumably
responsible,
i
guess
the
notion
that
it
would
be
the
new
york
times,
or
some
prominent
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
journalistic
purposes
under
this
statute
could
be
somebody
who
has
a
xerox
machine
in
his
basement.
unknown
speaker
and
just
wants
to
inform
the
public,
and
if
he
wants
to
spread
this
around
the
block--
unknown
speaker
--around
his
neighborhood--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
be
journalism.
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
isn't
the
instrumental/intrinsic
value
distinction
one
which
ultimately
dissolves?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
