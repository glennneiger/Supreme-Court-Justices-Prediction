argument
next
in
number
98-678,
the
los
angeles
police
department
v.
united
reporting
publishing
corporation.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
98-678,
los
angeles
police
department
versus
united
reporting
publishing.
the
respondent,
united
reporting
publishing
corporation,
provides
the
names
and
addresses
of
recently
arrested
individuals
to
its
customers.
its
customers
include
attorneys,
insurances
companies,
drug
and
alcohol
counselors
and
driving
schools.
united
reporting
obtained
the
address
information
from
the
petitioner,
the
los
angeles
police
department
under
a
california
statute.
the
california
legislature
amended
the
statute
to
require
that
a
person
requesting
addresses
declare
under
penalty
of
perjury
that
the
request
is
made
for
a
scholarly,
journalistic,
political,
governmental,
or
investigative
purpose
and
that
the
address
will
not
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
to
sell
a
product
or
service.
when
that
amendment
became
effective
in
1996,
the
police
department
denied
united
reporting’s
request
for
addresses
because
united
reporting
did
not
make
the
declarations
required
under
the
statute.
united
reporting
then
filed
suit
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
on
the
ground
that
the
amended
statute
was
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
ruled
the
amendment
statute
was
invalid
because
it
violated
the
first
amendment
on
its
face
and
therefore
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
it
concluded
that
united
reporting,
in
selling
the
addresses
to
its
clients,
engaged
in
constitutionally
protected
commercial
speech
and
that
the
amended
statute
unduly
burden
that
speech
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
united
reporting
was
not
entitled
to
prevail
on
a
facial
attack
on
the
california
statute.
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
facial
invalidation,
the
los
angeles
police
department
was
correct
in
arguing
here
that
the
statute
is
simply
a
law
regulating
access
to
information
in
the
government’s
hands.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
government
is
prohibiting
a
speaker
from
conveying
information
that
the
speaker
already
possess.
california
could
decide
if
it
wish
not
to
give
out
arrestee
information
at
all
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
to
the
extent
that
united
reporting’s
facial
challenge
of
the
statute
seeks
to
rely
on
the
statute
affects
on
parties
not
before
the
court,
like
united
reporting’s
clients,
the
claim
does
not
fall
within
the
case
law
allowing
courts
to
entertain
facial
challenges.
no
threat
of
prosecution,
cut-off
of
funds,
hangs
over
their
heads
and
there
is
no
possibility
that
protected
speech
will
be
muted.
thus,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
strike
down
the
statute
on
its
face.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
thomas
joins;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justices
o’connor,
souter,
and
breyer,
join;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
joins.
