mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
your
question
certainly
gets
to
the
heart
of
the
case,
which
is
that
this
case
is
about,
in
the
first
instance,
access,
who
can
have
access.
in
the
second
instance,
it
does
impose
a
use
restriction
on
people
who
are
allowed
to
have
access
under
the
statute.
so
fine,
let's
start
with
the
restriction,
the
condition
on
access,
and
the
cases
that
your
question
brings
to
mind
are,
for
instance,
the
rape
shield
cases
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
bjf,
cox
broadcasting,
cases
where
information
was
released
to
the
general
public,
is
the
way
the
court
characterized
it,
and
in
fact
what
the
court
said
was
that
it
was
released
without
qualification.
that
was
crucial
to
the
court's...
the
majority's
holding
in
florida
star
v.
bjf.
i
think
i'd
like
to
focus
on
that,
because
what
the
court
did
not
say
is
that
when
the
government
has
information
that
it
is
under
no
strong
form
of
constitutional
compulsion
to
make
public,
generally
public,
the
court
did
not
say
that
it
may
not
condition
its
release
of
that
information
in
certain
ways.
and
what
california
has
done
here
is
to
say,
look,
we
have
some
information
in
our
files.
we
would
like
to
make
it
available
for
certain
purposes
but
not
others.
that
is
not
a
general
release
even
when
you
give
it
to
the
press,
because
what
they've
said
to
the
press
is,
you,
too,
may
use
it
for
journalistic
purposes
but
not
to
sell
a
product
or
service,
and
let
me
give
content
to
that
by
saying
in
our
view
what
that
would
mean
is,
the
l.a.
times
can
print
the
addresses,
but
it
can't
use
them,
for
instance,
for
a
subscription
drive.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right,
and
that
gets
to
your
question
of
what
level
of
scrutiny
we're
under,
because
normally
what
we
would
say
is,
the
legislature
can
address
a
problem
that
it
perceives
one
step
at
a
time,
and
it
may
address
the
problem
that
it
perceives,
and
i...
it's
fair
to
say
on
this
record
and
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
problem
that
was
perceived
was
not
that
journalists
were
printing
those
addresses,
and
that
that
was
invading
people's
privacy,
but
that
commercial
services
were
gathering
them
and
selling
them
to
commercial
solicitors.
now,
if
we
were
in
a
world
of
heightened...
of
the
most
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny,
presumably
that
would
not
be
enough,
because
we
don't
say
the
government
can
proceed
one
step
at
a
time
normally
in
a
true
heightened
scrutiny
case,
but
this
is
not
a
true
heightened
scrutiny
case,
because
this
is
not
a
case
where
what
the
government
has
said
is,
you
have
information
and
you
may
not
publish
it.
what
the
government
has
said
is,
we
have
information,
and
you
may
have
it,
but
only
for
certain
purposes,
and
only
if
you
tell
us
you
won't
use
it
in
this
way,
and
that
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
what
bjf
and
cox
broadcasting
suggests
is
that
certainly
in
the...
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
institutional
press,
it
may
very
well
not
be
enough
to
have
a
restriction
set
off
somewhere
else
in
a
statute
which
puts
the
onus
on
the
reporter,
having
gotten
something
which
is
facially
perfectly
available
and
says
press
release
on
the
top,
for
that
reporter
to
know
that
there's
another
restriction
on
access.
what
we
have
here
is
something
that
before
he
gets
the,
or
she
gets
the
information,
the
reporter
signs
a
paper--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
say
if
it's...
applies
to
the
press,
it
is
probably
unconstitutional
under
bjf,
or
at
least
it's
constitutionally
problematic.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
court
has
been
reluctant
to
recognize
a
special
status.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
the
fundamental
distinction
that
we
draw
out
of
bjf
and
cox
broadcasting
on
this
point
is
this
one,
that
it
may
be
unfair,
the
court
has
said,
to
give
somebody
something
that
is
facially
perfectly
available
but
then
say,
gotcha,
there's
another
piece
of
a
statute
somewhere
that
you
may
not
have
known
about
that
criminalizes--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we...
well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
we
think
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
the
question
is,
can
the
government
in
one
form
or
another,
with
sufficient
safeguards
to
make
sure
that
it
is
not
tricking
or
hoodwinking
anybody,
put
conditions
on
the
release
of
information
in
its
files?
the
answer
is
yes.
it's
done
in
a
variety
of
federal
statutes.
it's
done
in
a
variety
of
state
statutes,
and
we
think--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--no.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
with
respect,
it
is
a
condition
precedent
to
getting
the
information.
now,
let
me
just
suggest
a
way
in
which
this
case
could
be
entirely
different.
suppose
the
statue
said,
we
don't
think
that
soliciting
people
is
a
good
idea
when
they've
just
been
arrested,
so
no
matter
where
you
got
the
address,
you
may
not
send
a
solicitation.
that
is
a
case
this
court
has
seen
before,
and
it's
one
that's
been
very
problematic.
this
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
if
you
have
the
address
because
you
did
the
spadework
yourself,
you
hung
around
the
courthouse,
you
knew
who
was
arrested,
however
you
got
it,
if
you
had
that
address,
you
may
sell
it,
you
may
use
it
to
send
information,
you
may
do
whatever
you
want
with
it,
but
you
may
not
get
that
address
from
public
records,
compiled
under
compulsion
for
public
purposes,
and
use
it
for
a
purpose
that
the
state
legislature
of
california
has
determined
is
not...
is
out
of
balance
with
the
privacy
invasion
that
it
causes.
that's
a
standard
sort
of
legislative
determination
about
what
use
may
be
made
of
government
information
and
government
files,
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
particularly
in
contexts
where
there
are
what
amount
to
constraints
on
quantity...
i
mean,
you
can't
have
everybody
traipsing
through
the
prisons,
so
when
you
have
a
constraint
on
quantity,
or
there's
a
limited
number
of
seats
in
a
courtroom,
you
may
make
certain
kinds
of
what
would
normally
be
neutral
but
i
think
can
probably
favor
the
press
in
some
circumstances.
the
members
of
the
court
have
suggested
you
could
favor
the
press
in
that
circumstance,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
perfectly
sensible
thing
to
do.
the
important
thing
here
is,
i
think,
to
emphasize
that
no
one
is
restricting
united
reporting's
ability
to
speak
in
any
way
that
has
to
do
with
its
own
speech
that
it
can...
an
unconstitutional
condition
case,
for
instance,
is
about
someone
who
is
at
liberty
to
speak
an
idea
that
he
has
from
some
other
source
and
is
prohibited
from
doing
that
because
the
government
says,
well,
i
won't
give
you
a
tax
exemption,
or
i
won't
give
you
employment
if
you
exercise
your
otherwise
freely
exercisable
right
to
speak.
here,
united
reporting
is
not
in
a
position
to
exercise
that
right
unless
it
gets
this
information
from
the
government.
now,
either
it
has
a
right
to
get
that
information--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
are
a
variety
of
kinds
of
information
that
the
government
may
have
a
practical
monopoly
or
a
near
monopoly
on,
and
what
i
would
suggest
is,
for
instance,
the
names
of
people
who
have
hiv
or
aids
may
be--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--en
masse,
probably
not,
the
same
way
there
is
not
to
get
the
list--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--no.
that's--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it
is
a
public
restriction
which
was
undertaken
with
the
consciousness
that
it
would
not
facilitate
a
certain
kind
of
commercial
speech,
and
that
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--what
i
do
not
agree
with
is
that
simply
because
the
government
may
have
a
practical
monopoly
on
compelling
the
compilation
of
the
information...
and
again
i
would
go
to
the
case
of
public
health.
there
may
be
things
the
government
compels
you
to
disclose
for
compelling
public
purposes,
but
it
ought
not
to
be
the
rule
that
the
first
amendment
then
requires
that
the
government
either
disclose
that,
or,
if
it
disclose
it
at
all,
disclose
it
completely
to
the
winds.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you.
