mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california
government
code
section
6254(f)(3)
requires
government
agencies
to
provide
access
to
the
addresses
of
arrestees
and
crime
victims
in
only
a
few
instances,
none
of
which
include
commercial
solicitation.
the
statute
in
this
respect
is
similar
to
at
least
80
laws
from
around
the
country
that
limit
access
to
a
wide
variety
of
government
records,
including
campaign
finance
reports,
welfare
records,
accident
reports,
and
even
the
personal
financial
disclosure
forms
of
the
members
of
this
court.
respondent
contends
that
subsection
(f)(3)
is
a
speech
restriction,
but
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
i
want
to
spend
just
a
couple
of
minutes
focusing
on,
shows
that
plainly
is
not
true,
and
it
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief
at
page
3.
one
point
to
make
at
the
outset
is
that
subsection
(f)(3)
limits
access
to
only
addresses,
not
any
of
the
other
information
that
the
state
has
about
crimes
and
about
crime
victims
and
about
arrestees,
but
subsection
(f)(3),
regarding
the
addresses
of
both
the
victims
and
the
arrestees--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
page
3.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
subsection
(f)(3)
teaches
that
with
respect
to
addresses
of
both
crime
victims
and
arrestees,
the
state
grants
access
only,
quote,
where
the
requester
declares,
under
penalty
of
perjury,
that
the
request
is
made
for
one
of
five
specified
purposes.
those
are,
a
scholarly,
journalistic,
political,
governmental
purpose,
or
investigation
purposes
by
a
licensed
private
investigator.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
has
never
been
tested.
in
fact,
the
respondent
requested
a
declaration
under
state
law
that
they
did
have
the
right
to
publish
this
under
the
journalistic
provision.
it's
always
been
an
open
question.
the
lower
courts
never
reached
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
both
to
the
victim
and
to
the
arrestee.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
think
the
difficulty
is,
and
again
the
lower
courts
never
reached
this
question
and
it
would
remain
open
on
remand,
is
what
precisely
respondent
wants
to
do
with
the
addresses,
with
respect
to
the
jail
mail
register.
if
you
look
at
the
end,
the
last
page
of
the
different
instances
of
the
jail
mail
register
that
are
published,
respondent
isn't
using
the
addresses
for
a
journalistic
purpose.
it
is
there
simply
creating
an
advertisement,
just
in
the
same
way
that
in
44
liquormart
the
advertisement
of
the
prices
in
that
case
and
other
commercial
speech
cases
were
themselves
not
journalistic.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
and
let
me...
that
is
exactly
the
distinction
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
with
the
remainder
of
subsection
(f)(3)
in
the
text.
there
is
a
misunderstanding
by
respondent
in
this
facial
challenge
about
what
the
statute
does
and
what
about...
what
use,
indirectly
or
directly,
to
sell
a
product
or
service
is.
the
statute
and
the
language
that
respondent
focuses
on,
where
it
says
that
address
information
obtained
pursuant
to
this
paragraph,
i.e.,
if
you
are
trying
to
get
it
for
one
of
the
five
permitted
purposes,
it
shall
not
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
to
sell
a
product
or
service,
is
simply
an
enforcement
provision.
it
says
that
you
cannot
have
access
if
you
intend
to
get
it
for
a
legitimate
purpose,
such
as
journalism,
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we're
still
within...
mr.
chief
justice,
still
within
(f)(3),
the
last
sentence.
it's
over
on
page
4a
now.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
rolls
over
and
it
says,
if
you
get
it,
or
are
trying
to
get
access
for
one
of
the
five
permitted
purposes,
say,
journalism
in
your
hypothetical,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
you
get
it
for
journalism,
you
can't
then
use
it
to
sell
a
product
or
service.
it
does
not
apply
to
third
party
end
users,
the
attorney
in
your
hypothetical.
it
is
only
enforceable
against
the
person
who
makes
the
representation
under
perjury
that
they
are
not
going
to...
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
selling
a
product
or
service.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
that...
with
respect,
the
los
angeles
times...
and
let
me
just
take
one
quick
detour.
no
paper
that
we're
aware
of
in
los
angeles
actually
prints
this
information
on
the
question
of
irrationality,
but
the
los
angeles
times
is
publishing
it
for
a
journalistic
purpose.
the
principal
reason
is
to
educate
the
public.
that's
why
some
papers
do
have
police
blotters.
we
do
not
interpret
the
statute,
at
the
point
that
the
los
angeles
times
knows
that
some
lawyer
is
using
the
information,
to
prohibit
them
from
having
access.
the
statute
is
directed
at
bulk
requesters
such
as
respondents,
or
individual
law
firms,
or
chiropractors,
or
driving
schools
who
come
in
and
just
have
a
commercial
purpose
for
requesting
access.
it
is
only
enforceable
against
the
individual
requesting
access,
who
has
to
make
a
declaration,
under
penalty
of
perjury,
of
what
their
purpose
in
asking
for
the
information
is.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
political
was
added
at
the
same
time
as
the
amendment
for
adding
governmental
purposes,
and
it
was,
as
we
understand
it,
simply
to
make
clear
that
it
wasn't
simply
the
government
then
existing.
it
could
include
partisan
politics,
electoral
campaigns
and
the
like.
it
was
just
to
draw
out
a
further
distinction
between
current
governments
and
the
possibility
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
a
state
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
not
to
sell
a
product
or
service,
that
is
exactly--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
what
happens
here,
to
focus
on
this
exact
example--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--is
that
if
respondent
wants
the
names
to
advertise
in
the
jail
mail
register
that
it
has
a
product
or
service...
and
it
does.
it
has
a
dial-up
service
where
you
can
get
access
to
3,
on
average,
350
names
and
addresses
of
arrestees
every
single
day
from
los
angeles
alone,
not
to
mention
the
180
other
law
enforcement
agencies.
if
you
are
a
newspaper,
or
you
are
the
local
television
station,
and
you
have
a
journalistic
purpose,
then
you
have
a
right
to
get
access,
but
if
your
purpose
in
doing
so
is
simply
to
sell
a
product
or
service,
it
doesn't
qualify.
and
if
i
could
just
make
one
qualification,
and
that
is
that
there...
the
only
reason
there
is
some
ambiguity
here
is
that
the
statute
was
enjoined
immediately.
the
statute,
under
subsection
6253.4
contemplates
that
law
enforcement
agencies,
local
governments,
will
issue
further
guidance
specifying
exactly
what
the
terms...
and
you
asked
the
question,
what
exactly
is
political.
there
will
be
further
guidance.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
has
not.
there
is
a
specific
provision
under
which
respondent
or
anybody
else
has
the
right
to
sue
us,
and
that
is
subsection
6258,
in
state
court
saying,
listen,
i
have
a
journalistic
purpose.
the
los
angeles
police
department
won't
give
me
the
information.
they
should,
i
have
a
right
to
attorney's
fees,
and
please
order
them
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
improvidently,
i
think
is
the
first
answer,
but
the--
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
what...
i
don't...
section
6254,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
as
between
the
parties
that
in
the
first
place
the
ninth
circuit
got
the
statute
wrong.
both
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
under
section
6254,
anyone
other
than
commercial
users
can
have
access
to
this
information.
it
was
just
wrong.
you
can't
get
information
for
employment,
to
discriminate
against
arrestees
on
the...
in
employment,
or
for
plain
old
nosiness,
or
if
you're
a
chiropractor,
or
if
you
want
to
offer
a
nonprofit
service.
they
interpreted
the
statute
just
plainly
in
conflict
with
its
plain
meaning.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
is.
there
truthfully
is.
if
you
just
want
to
know
what's
going
on
in
your
neighborhood
and
you
don't
have
any
other
purpose
behind
it,
it's
simply--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
would
depend
on
the
specific
facts,
and
to
take
them
just
as
you
say,
if
all
that
they
were
doing...
say
that
the
los
angeles
times
publishes
out...
publishes
a
special
version
for
lawyers,
and
it
says,
look,
we've
got
everybody
who's
arrested
for
dui,
it
would
be
a
much
closer
case,
and
i
think
what
you
would
see,
honestly,
is
the
california
legislature
addressing
that
problem.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
would
not,
but
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because
on
the
text
of
the
statute
the
sentence
about
selling
a
product
or
service
does
not
limit
the
scope
of
the
first
sentence.
if
you
have
a
journalistic
purpose,
you
are
not
then
limited
by
the
fact...
in
interpreting
what
we
mean
by
journalistic,
by
the
fact
that
you
know
there
will
be
an
end
user.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
that
is
not...
the
press
and
the
core
of
journalism,
under
the
constitutional
tradition
that
we
have,
and
what
we
think
of
as
police
blotters,
is
to
simply
educate
the
public
about
what
is
going
on
in
the
community.
that's
what
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
the
main,
if
you
are
publishing
a
police
blotter,
in
the
traditional,
journalistic
sense
that
is
a
journalistic
purpose.
let
me
again--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--journalism
includes
the
press.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
state
and
the
legislative
history
explains
this.
it
was
trying
to
preserve
an
instance
where
you
are
simply
attempting
to
educate
the
public
about
what
is
going
on
with
arrests.
but
let
me
just
specify
again
that
we
are
now
dealing
with
a
problem
of
statutory
construction,
and
not
constitutional
mandate,
and
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
it's
never
been
applied
to
respondent.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
newspapers
would
not
exist
if
they
couldn't
sell
newspapers,
but
they
are
trying
to
educate
the
public,
with
respect.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
the
los
angeles--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they
did.
the
los
angeles
police
department's
briefs
below
invoke
all
of
this
court's
decisions
about
right
to
access,
and
about
how
the
standard
is
much
lower.
we
do
say
in
the
lower
court
briefs
that
this
can
be
analyzed
under
central
hudson,
but
we
specify
that
the
court
has
to
give
substantial
more
leniency--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
the
los
angeles
police
department
said
below,
and
believes
strongly
here,
of
course,
that
this
is
an
access
case,
that
all
that
we
do--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
agree
that
it...
none.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
with
respect,
on
a
full
reading
of
the
los
angeles
police
department's
briefs
below,
this
case...
this
court's
cases
like
houchin,
zemel
and
the
like
are
cited
and
fully
relied
on.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
under
the
hypothetical,
if
you
simply
want
to
sell
addresses
of
arrestees
and
victims,
without
regard
to
what
somebody
else
is
going
to
do
with
them,
you
just
want
to
sell
them,
you
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
do,
you
are
prohibited
from
receiving
access
under
the
first
sentence
of
subsection
(f)(3)
because
you
don't
have
one
of
the
five--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you
must.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
it
is
enforceable
only
as
against
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
absolutely
not.
the
heartland
of
the
statute
is
about
the
person
who
wants
to
get
the
350
addresses
and
names
every
single
day
which
aren't
published
anywhere
else.
the
hypothetical
has
come
up
about
a
potential
ambiguity
in
the
statute
about
who
is
a
journalist,
which
has
never
been
tested
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
understand
to
be
presented
here.
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
that
there
are
massive
wholesale
invasions
of
privacy
that
occur
in
the
status
quo.
in
a
sense,
our
freedom
of
information
act
has
been
hijacked
into
something
that
it
was
never
intended
to
do,
which
was
to
educate
people
about
what
the
government
was
doing.
and
if
i
could--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
do
accept
the
distinction
insofar
as
it
means
that
respondent's
sales
of
addresses
aren't
subject
to
the
highest
level
of
first
amendment
scrutiny.
they
aren't
the
press.
they
may
not
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
just
simply
on
the
perspective
of
them
transmitting
data.
information
is
a
commodity
to
respondent.
it
has
no
intrinsic
value.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
information
is
a
means
of
communicating
an
idea
for
the
new
york
times.
but
to
get
to
the
second
half,
possibly
the
more
important
part
of
your
question--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
in
a
larger
context,
even...
and
the
same
is
true
of
a
police
blotter.
they
are
trying
to
communicate
what
is
going
on
in
the
community,
but
again,
i
really
need
to
get
to
the
second
part
of
your
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
respondent
did
request
a
declaration
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
never
got
to
that
part
of
the
case,
yes.
to
get
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
mr.
justice,
this
case
does
not
turn
at
all
on
that
distinction
because
it
is
an
access
restriction.
it
is
enforceable
only
as
an
access
restriction.
the
only
thing
that
we
do
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--taking...
take
your
question
to
the
furthest.
assume
that
respondent
was
the
los
angeles
times.
it
is
fairly
clear,
and
the
lower
courts
agreed,
that
we
could
limit
access
to
everyone,
including
the
los
angeles
times.
this
is
a
question
of
differentiation
only.
