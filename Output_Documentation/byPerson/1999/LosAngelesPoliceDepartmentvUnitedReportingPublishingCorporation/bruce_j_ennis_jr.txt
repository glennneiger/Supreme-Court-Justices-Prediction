mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
not
essential
to
our
argument
whether
the
lapd
could
withhold
this
information
from
everyone.
the
key
to
our
argument
is,
this
statutory
scheme
requires
first
amendment
review
because
it
discriminates
between
speakers
in
order
to
reduce
the
amount
of
commercial
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not
to
win
this
case.
they
are
additional
arguments
why
we
could
win
this
case
if
we
don't
win
on
the
narrower
ground.
our
narrower
ground
is
that,
regardless
of
the
form
of
the
law,
any
law
that
discriminates
between
speakers
in
order
to
reduce
a
category
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
requires
first
amendment
review.
the
government
does
not
claim
that
this
discrimination
is
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
any
scarce
resource--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
question,
and
it's
not
necessary
to
resolve
that
question
here.
as
kqed
itself
makes
clear,
the
government
there
could
have
excluded
everyone
from
coming
into
the
prison,
but
as
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion,
which
made
the
plurality,
stresses,
although
the
press
does
not
have
a
superior
right
of
access
above
and
beyond
what
the
prison
accords
to
the
public,
once
the
prison
accords
an
access
right
to
the
public,
the
press
has
an
equal
right
of
access
unless
there
is
a
strong
justification
for
the
discrimination.
equality
of
access,
once
the
prison
has
opened
its
doors
to
some,
was
the
key
concept
in
kqed.
that's
our
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
for
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--for
the
reasons--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--for
the
reasons
we
list
in
our
brief,
it
is
our
view
that
in
this
area,
arrests,
a
total
denial
of
access
would
be
highly
constitutional
suspect.
here's
why.
the
government,
you
must
remember,
is
the
one
who
has
arrested
these
individuals,
and
if
it's
denying
access
in
order
to
prevent
lawyers
from
gaining
access
to
assist
and
defend
them
against
the
government
itself,
that's
an
access
question
in
which
the
government
has
a
conflict
of
interest
and
i
think
might
violate
the
constitution,
but
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
there.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
there
is--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--there
is
no
specific
holding
of
this
court--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--which
you
could
apply
to
say,
as
a
rote
matter,
we
would
win
that
general
access
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
there
are
holdings
of
this
court
which
make
clear
that
once
the
government
has
opened
its
doors
to
broad
access,
it
cannot
discriminate
in
access
without
a
governmental
interest
that
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression.
if
you
look,
for
example--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
two
cases
i
think
are
quite
instructive,
justice
kennedy.
in
discovery
network
this
court
applied
intermediate
scrutiny
where
"the
burden
on
commercial
speech
was
imposed
by
denying
the
speakers
access
to
public
property.
"
here--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no.
here,
the
burden
on
commercial
speech
is
imposed
by
denying
the
speaker
access
to
information,
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
case,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
do,
justice
breyer,
and
the
answer
to
your
question
is
both.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not
at
all.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
first
try
to
say
that
it
is
our
view,
which
we
briefed,
that
all
of
united
reporting's
speech
is
fully
protected
speech.
united
reporting's
speech
is
not
an
advertisement
saying,
buy
my
journal.
it
is
selling
the
information
the
same
way
the
new
york
times
or
the
los
angeles
times
sells
the
information.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
here's
why...
here's
why
justice
breyer,
because
there
are
two
parts
to
this
statute,
and
even...
as
they
say
in
their
brief,
petitioner
says
in
its
brief
expressly,
even
if
united
reporting
gets
access
to
address
information
for
a
legitimate
journalistic
purpose,
assuming
that
the
jail
mail
register
is
a
legitimate
journal,
it
cannot
then
sell
that
information
to
its
subscribers
because
it
knows
that
its
subscribers
will
use
that
information
to
try
and
sell
a
product
or
service,
namely
their
service
as
attorneys,
bail
bondsmen,
and
the
statute
prohibits
not
only
the
direct
use
but
the
indirect
use.
the
statute
says,
even
once
the
information
has
been
lawfully
disclosed,
that
information
cannot
be
used,
quote,
directly
or
indirectly
to
sell
a
product
or
service.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
no,
i
wouldn't
think
that,
because
it's
not
an
advertisement.
it's
containing
information,
the
same
way
in
dun
&
bradstreet
this
court
held
that
financial
credit
newsletters
are
fully
protected
speech,
the
same
way
in
sec
v.
lowe
this
court
held
that
investment
newsletters
and
stock
quote
letters
are
fully
protected
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
ours
is,
too.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
many
cases
that
support
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it's
traceable
to
the
discrimination
principle
which
applies
across
the
board,
and
the
second
case
i
wanted
to
mention
in
that
regard
that
i
think
is
instructive
is
the
seattle
times
v.
rhinehart
case.
that
case
involved
a
court-ordered
discovery
order
which
granted
access
to
information
to
which
the
party
otherwise
would
not
have
access,
but
at
the
same
time
said,
we
are
going
to
grant
you
this
access
only
if
you
use
it
for
purposes
of
this
litigation,
and
not
for
general
speech.
this
court
applied
intermediate
scrutiny
to
review
that
access
use
scheme.
i
can
see
no
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
on
that
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
it's
government
action,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
making
available
information
that
is
not
generally
available.
in
fact,
it
follows
a
fortiori--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
first
question,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
this
case
gets
any
first
amendment
review,
and
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition,
discovery
and
seattle
times,
yes,
it
gets
first
amendment
review.
the
second
question
is
on
the
merits,
and
there,
in
seattle
times
the
court
emphasized
that
it
survived
intermediate
scrutiny
because
the
government
had
a
legitimate
government
purpose
in
limiting
use
that
was
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression.
it
was
for
use
in
facilitating
litigation
proceedings,
and
here--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
let
me
answer
that
question
by
beginning
to
say
first,
the
government
doesn't
claim
here
that
address
information
is
a
scarce
resource,
so
this
is
not
like
the
subsidy
cases.
it
doesn't
claim
that
it
needs
to
limit
this
information
in
order
to--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--not
in
this
sense,
justice
stevens.
in
a
subsidy
context,
the
government
cannot
give
the
same
dollar
bill
to
every
speaker
who
wants
it,
but
it
can
give
the
same
address
information
to
every
speaker
who
wants
it.
there's
no
scarcity
problem
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
any
act
is
subject
to
constitutional--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer,
here's
why.
in
every
single
one
of
the
federal
statutes
cited
in
petitioner's
and
the
united
states
briefs,
those
statutes
were
all
justified
by
nonspeculative
harm,
and
all
of
them
materially
advanced
a
governmental
interest
that
was
unrelated
to
suppression
of
expression,
for
example,
a
subsidy
type
of
interest.
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
in
fact...
in
fact,
under
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i'm
not--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
under
that
act,
everyone
has
access
to--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--exactly
the
same
information.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
right,
but
there's
no
discrimination
among--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes.
there--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
it
would
take
more
time
than
is
warranted,
justice
breyer.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
the
answer
is,
first,
i
think
that
would
require
at
least
intermediate
first
amendment
review.
the
second
question
is
whether
it
would
satisfy
intermediate
review
or
not,
and
the
answer
is,
it's
far
more
likely
to
satisfy
intermediate
review
than
this
case,
because
there's...
here
the
sole
justification...
look
at
page
11
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
they
justify
this
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
will,
quote,
reduce
commercial
solicitation
of
arrestees.
the
justification
they
advance
for
this
scheme
is,
it
will
reduce
commercial
speech.
they
don't--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--vastly
different--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
souter,
because
in
went
for
it
this
court's
opinion
i
think
makes
quite
clear,
as
it
surely
makes
clear
in
shapero
and
edenfield,
that
a
naked
desire
to
suppress
commercial
solicitation
is
not
even
a
substantial
and
legitimate
governmental
interest.
there
has
to
be
more.
in
went
for
it,
the
more
was,
there
was
a
particularly
vulnerable
population,
and
it
was
a
time-limited
ban
on
solicitation.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
didn't
hear
you,
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
it
was,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
and
because
of
an
interest
that
was
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
first
of
all,
justice
stevens,
there's
no
basis
to
believe
that's
so.
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear.
it
was
an
undisputed
fact
that
arrestees
find
these
solicitations
from
lawyers
who
are
trying
to
defend
them
against
the
state
who
has
arrested
them
helpful.
there
were
declarations--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--but
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
has
always
been
the
law
in
all
of
this
court's
commercial
speech
cases
even,
that
the
state
bears
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
harm
is
more
than
speculative,
and
that
the
law
will
materially
achieve
the
state's
objectives.
here,
the
state
did
not
prove
either.
it
did
not...
for
the
13
years
before
this
amendment
to
the
statute
was
passed,
everyone
could
get
this
information
and
could
freely
solicit
arrestees.
there
was
no
evidence--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
it's
their
burden
to
do
that,
though,
justice
ginsburg,
under
all
these
court
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we're
not
saying,
justice
ginsburg,
that
everybody
is
entitled
to
access.
what
we're
saying
is,
once
the
state
opens
up
this
information
for
broad
access,
for
many
governmentally
approved
purposes,
then
the
state
can
only
deny
access
for
a
reason
that
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression.
if
the
government
has
some
legitimate
government-functioning
interest
to
justify
the
discrimination,
that
would
survive.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
we
did
not
challenge
this
law
insofar
as
it
deals
with
addresses
of
victims
of
crimes.
we
don't
publish
that
information,
never
have,
and
it's
undisputed
we
never
would.
that's
a--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
because
i
frankly
haven't
thought
about
it
enough.
we
didn't
challenge
the
statute
with
respect
to
victim
addresses.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
the
newspapers
can
get
that,
but
if--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--but
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
raises
a
very
important
point,
because
the
statute,
this
statutory
section
itself
has
an
opt-out
provision
which
says
that
victims
can
preclude
disclosure
of
their
names,
which
would
otherwise
be
required,
at
their
request.
under
the
central
hudson
test,
prong
4,
that's
fatal
here,
because
the
same
opt-out
provision
would
fully
achieve
the
government's
interest--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--in
protecting
privacy
of
arrestees
who
don't
want
to
be
solicited.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer,
as
i
understand
it,
you've
asked
two
questions.
let
me
try
to
answer
them
in
order.
first,
on
the
privacy
question,
as
shapero
held,
quote,
the
privacy
invasion,
if
any,
occurs
when
the
lawyer
discovers
the
recipient's
legal
affairs,
not
when
he
confronts
the
recipient
with
discovery
through
targeted
direct
mail
solicitation.
that's
not
a
privacy
invasion,
to
get
a
letter
in
the
mail.
as
bolger
and
con
ed
and
every
case
said,
that's
so
simple,
just
throw
the
letter
in
the
waste
basket,
that's
not
considered
to
be
a
privacy--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
that
that
cuts
our
way,
because
under
this
statute
the
crucial
fact
that
a
named
individual
has
been
arrested
and
charged
with
a
specific
crime
is
disclosed
to
everyone,
and
can
be
publicly
disclosed
to
everyone.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
in
practical
terms
it
is,
justice
souter.
if
you'll
look
at
the
record,
supplemental
excerpts
of
record,
pages
496
through
547
are
examples
from
the
sacramento
bee,
which
on
a
regular
basis,
i
think
several
times
a
week,
prints
what's
called
the
police/fire
log,
which
lists
the
names
and
addresses
and
charges
of
everyone.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
you
can
get
that.
anybody
can
find
that
information
from
the
sacramento
bee.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
first,
it's
not
just
sacramento.
that's
the
excerpts
in
the
record,
but
there
are
also
declarations
about
oceanside,
california
and
other
places.
but
this
cuts
our
way,
because
think
about
it,
if
you're
an
arrestee,
and
some
newspaper
publishes,
any
newspaper
publishes
this
information
to
the
world
at
large,
you've
got
to
worry
about
that
problem.
contrast
that
with
getting
a
private,
confidential
letter
in
the
mail
from
an
attorney
or
bail
bondsman.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--we
all
get,
every
day,
junk
mail
that
drives
us
crazy,
and
junk
telephone
calls.
there
are
opt-out
remedies
for
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
way
it's
pursued.
the
fe...
the
federal
government
has
adopted
regulations
for
telemarketing
which
have
an
opt-out
provision.
if
you
don't
like
getting
that
stuff,
you
can
opt
out.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
ginsburg,
here,
the
statute
doesn't
do
either.
it
doesn't
have
an
opt
out,
or
it
doesn't
have
an
opt
in.
either
one
would
be
better
than--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--two
terms
ago
when
this
court
decided
a
cable
indecency
case
it
found
that
an
opt-in
provision
unduly
burdened
first
amendment
rights,
whereas
an
opt-out
provision
would
not,
so
an
opt-in
provision
is
more
constitutionally
suspect,
but
even
that
would
be
far
better
than
what
this
scheme
is.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
get
back
to--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--answering
your
prior
question,
if
i
could,
first,
justice
breyer,
the,
basically
what
i
described
as
the
compensating
benefits
view
that,
well,
there
are
benefits
to
letting
the
public
learn
about
addressee
information.
i
think
this
court
has
already
rejected
that
compensating
benefits
analysis
in
both
greater
new
orleans
broadcasting,
and
in
discovery
itself,
where
the
same
argument
was
made.
it's
a
greater
benefit
to
have
fully
protected
speech
than
commercial
speech.
in
greater
new
orleans
broadcasting,
the
government
allowed
advertising
by
government
casinos
and
indian
casinos
on
the
ground
that
that
would
further
the
compensating
benefit
of
governmental
autonomy
and
revenue
generation
for
those
governmental
units,
but
this
court
pointed
out
that
that
did
not
mean
that
the
statute
did
not
undermine
the
justification
for
its
purpose,
which
was
decreasing
advertising
about
gambling.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
same
is
true
here.
every
single
time
there's
an
increase
in
public
understanding
about
addressee
addresses,
there's
a
corresponding
decrease
in
addressee
privacy,
which
is
the
ostensible
justification.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
that's
exactly
what
was
at
issue
in
seattle
times
v.
rhinehart,
which
is
why
i
raised
that
case.
in
seattle
times,
the
media
did
not
have
the
information.
they
tried
to
get
it.
the
government
said,
we
will
compel
the
opposing
party
to
give
you
the
information,
but
only
if
you
use
it
only
for
purposes
of
litigation
and
not
for
general
publication.
they...
without
that
condition,
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
information,
the
same
as
our
case,
and
this
court
did
apply
intermediate
scrutiny
there.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
not
have
to
establish
a
raw
right
of
access
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
case.
our
case
hinges
on
the
discrimination
among
speakers
when
access
is
granted
for
governmentally
approved
purposes,
including
speech
purposes,
journalism,
and
is
denied
when
access
is
withheld
for
governmentally
disapproved
speech
purposes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
held
that
it's
only
journalism
that
is
responsible.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
or
a
web
site.
i...
there--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
would
be
journalism.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
or
just
tell
the
next-door
neighbor
in
a
leaflet.
i
have
very
little
time.
i'd
like
to
make
two
brief
points.
the
first
is,
a
late
concern
has
been
raised
about
computerized
data
banks.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
was
completely
speculative,
no
evidence
there
were
such
data
banks
in
the
13
years
when
this
law
allowed
access.
but
more
important
is,
this
statute
allows
everybody
to
get
the
name,
occupation,
and
date
of
birth,
and
the
date
of
birth
is
a
far
better
identifier
than
the
current
address
for
data
bank
purposes.
second,
justice
souter
asked
about
the
intrinsic
value
of
this
speech.
i
think
that
it
has
intrinsic
value,
because
it
identifies
the
precise
person
named
john
jones
who
has
been
arrested
and
charged
with
a
particular
crime.
the
fact
that
it's
not
just
instrumental
is
made
clear
by
the
fact
that
newspapers
publish
the
address
information.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
it
does.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
mentioned
that
the
scheme
plainly
fails
the
fourth
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test
because
there
is
an
opt-out
alternative.
the
petitioner
and
the
united
states
don't
even
discuss
that.
they
don't
say,
why
would
it
not
be
sufficient
to
allow
arrestees
to
opt
out,
as
the
same
statute
allows
victims
to
opt
out.
they
don't
discuss
it
because
there's
no
answer
to
it.
i
finally
want
to
say
that
they've
also
raised
at
the
last
minute
a
discrimination
argument.
that
argument
does
not
stop
discrimination
by
employers
if
they
get
the
address
information
from
newspapers
or
private
investigators.
furthermore,
the
name
and
date
of
birth
would
be
sufficient
for
most
employers,
who
are
going
to
track
potential
employees
by
name,
to
discriminate
against
them.
third,
it's
an
entirely
speculative
justification,
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
it
and,
finally,
the
government
could
directly
prohibit
the
use
of
this
information
by
anyone
to
discriminate
in
employment,
and
that
would
not
be
a
speech
restriction.
thank
you.
