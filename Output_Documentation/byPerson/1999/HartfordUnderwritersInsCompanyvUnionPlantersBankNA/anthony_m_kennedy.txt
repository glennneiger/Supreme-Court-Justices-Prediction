justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
have
asked
the
judge
to
instruct
the
trustee
to
exercise
his
discretion
to
collect
the...
to
impose
the
surcharge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
it
would
have
been
abuse,
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
trustee
to
go
ahead
and
seek
the
surcharge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
trustee
in
your
view
in
this
case
have
the
discretion
either
to
seek
the
surcharge
or
not
to
seek
the
surcharge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think,
if
you
were
the
counsel
for
the
trustee,
you
would
have
told
the
trustee
that
he
has
discretion
not
to
pursue
the
surcharge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
now
we're
in
the
position
where
the
code
says,
with
its...
within
the
trustee's
discretion
not
to
pursue
the
surcharge,
and
yet
the
creditor
can
force
it.
that
seems
a
little
odd
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
still
seems
odd
to
me.
if
the
trustee
has
the
discretion
not
to
do
so,
for
the
creditor
to
force
it,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
in
effect
controlling
the
discretion
of
the
trustee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes,
but
if
they
operate
at
a
loss,
that's
not
much
of
a
benefit
to
the
secured
creditor.
that's
the
whole
problem,
is
these
people
have
been
operating.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
when
the
premiums
were
not
paid?
without--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
my
question
is
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
the
current
premium
has
not
been
paid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
hartford,
under
missouri
law,
have
the
requirement
to
continue
to
provide
the
coverage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
just
30
days?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
seek
for
some
6
or
7
months,
am
i
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--up
front.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
trustee
chose
to
seek
these
funds
to
surcharge
the
property
and,
either
by
an
accounting
entry
or
by
the
actual
receipt
of
cash,
received
$25,000,
would
that
be
paid
100
percent
to
you,
or
could
the
trustee
say,
well
now,
i
have
my
own
administrative
expenses,
too,
and
other,
and
there
are
other
administrative...
how
does
that
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
in
my
hypothetical
he's
not
quite
sure,
and
so
he
goes
to
court
seeking
authority
to
pay.
he
gets
it.
does
that
go
just
to
you,
or
does
it
go
to
other
administrative
claimants
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
there
are
other
ones.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
say
they
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
claim
that,
but
he
just
seeks
authority
to
recover
the
money
for
you,
and
then
it's
there
in
the
pot.
doesn't
everybody
get
to
share
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
to
do
that
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
where
you
yourself
can
sue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
once
you
get
a
surcharge
you
have
to
share
it
with
everybody
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know.
well,
you
help
me
with
my
question.
what
happens
if
you
prevail
and
you
succeed
in
a
surcharge?
do
you
have
to
share
with
other
administrative
claimants
who
have
made
a
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
does--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
court
have
the
authority
to
allow
hartford
to
proceed,
under
what
section
of
the
code?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
right,
but--
--i
thought
that
in
response
to
justice
breyer
you
said,
now,
you
go
to
the
trustee
and
the
court,
and
if
the
trustee
doesn't
want
to
do
it,
then
you
ask
the
court
for
authority
to
do
it
on
your
own,
but
now
you're
saying
that
a
court
doesn't
have...
can't
allow
you
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
those
proper
cases,
and
proper
holdings
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
i'm
not
sure
why
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
isn't
that
the
hartford
goes
to
the
court,
it
asks
to
order
the
trustee,
if
the
court
and
the
trustee
give
no
relief,
there's
nothing
hartford
can
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you
didn't
say
it
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
brownlee,
going--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
suppose
a
pipe
in
the
building
is
leaking.
they
need
a
plumbing
contractor
immediately,
or
the
building's
going
to
be
wrecked.
you
represent
the
plumbing
contractor,
and
he
comes
to
you
and
says,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
paid.
how...
what
are
the
different
ways
he
can
do
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
anything
else--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
at
risk
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
anything
else
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
anything
else
you're
at
risk
of
having
to
share
with
the
other
administrative
creditors?
