--you
would
agree,
mr.
brownlee,
that
the
standard
situation
in
which
506
applies
is
where
the
trustee
has
paid
out
cash,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
he
gets
back
that
cash
from
the
security,
from
the
sale
of
the
secured
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
often
has
506
applied
to
credit
transactions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
mean
practically.
you've
just
said
the
standard
instance
in
which
506
is
used
is,
the
trustee
pays
out
dollars,
and
then
the
property
is
sold,
and
he
gets
those
dollars
back
from
the
top
of
the
price.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that
is
the
core
situation
to
which
506
applies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
you
know,
you
keep
talking
about
pre-code
practice,
and
i
looked
at
your
cases,
and
there
isn't
all
that
pre-code
practice.
i
mean,
there's
the
one
decision
that
you're
relying
on
from
this
court
before
there
was
any
bankruptcy
legislation,
and
then
another
one
that's
an
admiralty
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
doesn't
show
a
very
solid
pre-code
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you're
relying
on
one
rather
old
supreme
court
decision
and
some
lower
court
decisions
following
it
up.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
that
is
not
a
very
strong
peg
for
claiming
this
understood
pre-code
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
a
number
of
them
weren't.
i
mean,
the
thing
eventually
ended
up
in
chapter
7,
and
it
was
liquidated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brownlee,
i'm
not...
you
made
a
major
shift
from
your
brief
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
and
so
i'd
really
like
to
know
what
your
position
is.
that
is,
you
made
a
big
thing
about
50(c)...
it
wasn't
the
trustee
only.
it
was
the
trustee
and
carrot
mark...
your
client,
but
now
you
say
justice
scalia
has
the
better
reading
and
506
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
so
which
one
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
dropping
your
reliance
on
506?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
it
was
in
11,
because
that's
what
made
it
possible
for
the
thing
to
go
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would...
that's
a
very
candid
answer.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
a
government
agency
came
in
to
do
the
clean-up,
having
been
authorized
by
the
debtor?
