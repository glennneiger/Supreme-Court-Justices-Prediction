justice
david
h.
souter
how
does
that
relate
to
your
argument
that
you
were
required
to
provide
insurance
anyway
because
this
individual,
or
the
company
would
have
been
within
the
assigned
risk
pool?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
all
you're
saying
is,
we
had
to
start
insuring.
when
we
could
stop
insuring
was
in
fact
a
complex
function
of
the
audit.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
are
there
priorities
within
the
506(c)
administrative
claimants?
justice
david
h.
souter
including
those
pre-conversion
and
post
conversion?
justice
david
h.
souter
ah.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
can't--
justice
david
h.
souter
hartford--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
assume
that
is
correct,
then,
if
we
assume
that
is
a
proper
practice,
then
if
hartford
had
done
two
things
differently,
hartford
would
be
entitled
to
recover,
i
take
it,
on
the
assumption
that
there
may
be
a
derivative
action,
and
the
two
different
things
are,
number
1,
hartford
would
have
to
have
gone
to
the
trustee,
and
the
trustee
would
have
had
to
indicate
refusal.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
number
2,
hartford,
in
bringing
its
suit,
would
have
to
have
captioned
it,
hartford
ex
rel,
or
trustee
ex
rel
hartford,
rather
than
hartford,
and
if
those
two
facts
had
been
different,
assuming
derivative
actions
are
appropriate,
hartford
could
recover
here.
am
i
right,
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
why
does
it
have
to
get
the
court
order
if
there's
no
statutory
section
on
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
if
we
assume
derivative
standing
is...
i'm
making
that
assumption...
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
hartford
gets
the
court
order
or
doesn't
get
the
court
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
merely
orderly
procedure?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
hartford
has
indicated
that
that's
exactly
what
it
will
do,
although
that's
i
guess
an
easy
concession,
because
it
says
there
aren't
any.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
ah.
ah,
okay.
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
then,
that
i
misspoke
or
he
misspoke
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
he's...
i
will
make
the
further
assumption
that
any
recovery
would
be
subject
to
the
claims
of
all
others
in
the
same
class
that
hartford
is
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
if
that
would
be
the
legal
effect
of
hartford's
recovery
here,
is
the
only
thing,
then,
that
prevents
hartford
from
doing
that
the
failure
of
hartford
to
have
gone
to
the
trustee
in
the
first
place
and
said,
let
me
bring
a
derivative
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
brownlee--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
have
this
answer
to
justice
breyer's
one-third,
two-third
hypothetical?
i
mean,
it's
a
problem
for
your
case,
and
i
thought
the
answer
might
be
this,
but
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
assuming
derivative
standing...
the
premise
of
my
other
question.
assume
it
again.
if
the
one
administrative
creditor
has
administrative
standing,
what
he
will
do,
i
presume,
is
to
bring
an
action
on
behalf
of
all
administrative
creditors,
so
he
will
not
nearly
collect
his
insurance
premium.
he
will
collect
the
charges
of
all
other
administrative
creditors,
and
therefore
he
will
get
in
a...
theoretically
100
percent
of
what
is
owed,
and
so
he
will
get
his
one-third,
and
they
will
get
their
two-thirds,
and
everybody
will
be
whole.
is
that
the
answer
to
the
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
right,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
dumb
assumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
to
the
extent
that
that
assumption
would
be
true,
is
that
the
way
we
avoid
the
one-third,
two-third
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
we'll
assume
the
trustee
is
broke
and
so
on,
but
assume
it
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
