we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-409,
the
hartford
underwriters
insurance
company
v.
the
union
planters
bank.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
simply
arguing
that
if
the
code
says
nothing,
the
pre-code
practice
applies,
notwithstanding
something
like
506(c)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
had
had
a
prior
arrangement
with
the
trustee...
i
don't
know
whether
you
did
or
not...
could
an
action
be
brought
in
state
court
on
the
basis
of
representations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
didn't...
that's
not
the
question
i
asked
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
maybe
the
eighth
circuit
had
reserved
the
question
of
whether
there
was
some
right
you
had
to
go
into
federal
court
on
diversity
or
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
panel
opinion
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
you
brought
any
claims
in
the
district
court,
or
any
other
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--who
can
speak
to
engage
a
client
such
as
yours
to
continue?
is
it
the
trustee?
do
you
have
to
have
an
arrangement
with
the
trustee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
in
the
first
place,
after
bankruptcy,
who
authorizes
your
client
to
continue
paying
for
workman's
compensation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
any
authorization
from
the
trustee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
but
is
the
debtor
authorized
to
incur
expenses
which
will
be
ultimately
classified
as
administrative
expenses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
correct,
your
honor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
possible
congress
might
have
wanted
to
change
this,
figuring
that
what
you
describe
as
pre-code
practice
would
attract
a
certain
amount
of
leeches
who
wanted
to
get
at
the
secured
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brunstad--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
brunstad,
in
midlantic,
which
you
say
is
the
case
that
stands
for
the
proposition
of
bringing
forward
pre-code
practice
if
congress
doesn't...
we
said
in
codifying
the
judicially
developed
rule
of
abandonment,
congress
also
presumably
included
the
established
corollary,
et
cetera.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
rule
are
you
saying
that
506(c)
codified
that
should
bring
with
it
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
really
isn't
a
very...
i
mean--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
certainly...
midlantic
is
much
narrower
than
saying
the
statutory...
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg,
that
we
bring
all
sorts
of
other
things
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it's...
midlantic
is
talking
about,
they're
codifying
something
and
you
can
tell
from
the
language
of
the
section
that
they're
codifying
it.
you
can't
tell
from
506(c)
that
they're
codifying
anything
as
broad
as
you
say,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
set-off
and
recoupment
seem
much
closer
to
one
another
than
506(c)
and
what
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that's
a
general
statement
that
really
i
don't
see...
how
does
that
aid
you
in
this
particular
case,
when
you're
talking
about
506(c)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
me
that
is
the
difficulty
with
your
position,
and
the
cases
where
we've
said
pre-code
practice,
you
can
point
to
a
section
and
say,
yes,
this
brings...
this
says
(a),
but
it
also
means
the
corollary
to
(a)
under
prior
practice,
but
you
don't
have
an
alternative
section
to
point
to.
506(c)
doesn't
help
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
come
to
court
under
506(c)?
because
that's
the
question
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
can't,
you
lose
on
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
brownlee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
pursuit
in
the
bankruptcy
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
in
the
plenary
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
bankruptcy--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brownlee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-409,
hartford
underwriters
insurance
co.
versus
union
planters
bank
will
be
announced
by
