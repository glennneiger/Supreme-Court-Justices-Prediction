mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
century
preceding
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
in
196...
1978,
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
recognized
and
enforced
the
rule
that
an
unpaid
administrative
claimant
in
a
bankruptcy
case
can
come
to
court
and
have
his
or
her
claim
paid
if
the
expense
benefited
the
secured
party.
the
federal
courts
also
recognized
the
rule
that
a
trustee
who
pays
a
claim
may
come
and
seek
to
charge
the
secured
party's
collateral
if
there
was
a
benefit
to
the
secured
party.
in
enacting
section
506(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
congress
recognized
the
right
of
the
trustee,
and
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
congress'
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
trustee
was
therefore
intended
to
abrogate
the
other
pre-code
practice,
which
is
that
the
administrative
claimant
could
come
to
court
and
have
the
claim
paid.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
as
the
court
stated
2
years
ago
in
the
cohen
case,
cited
in
our
brief,
at
523
u.s.
at
221,
we
will
not
read
the
bankruptcy
code
to
erode
past
bankruptcy
practice
absent
a
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
such
a
departure.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
part
that
congress
recognized
was
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
wilson
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
rule
which
this
court
recognized
was
that
the
unpaid
administrative
claimant
could
come
forward
and
have
the
claim
paid.
now,
we
know
under
the
bankruptcy
code
that
congress
will
codify
some
of
the
equitable
doctrines
that
preceded
its
enactment,
and
yet
this
court
has
recognized
other
equitable--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--actually,
your
honor,
yes,
my
client
did.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
the
trustee's
position
was
that
the
trustee
had
no
interest
in
this
case
and
would
not
pursue
it.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
we
could
have
asked
the
bankruptcy
court
to
do
that,
but
we
think
that
the...
it
would
have
been
futile,
because
the
trustee
had
no
funds
whatsoever
to
engage
in
litigation
with
the
secured
party.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
would
have
been,
your
honor,
completely
futile,
plus
i
think
your
honor
would
have
to
recognize
in
this
case
that
the
trustee
having
no
interest
in
recovery
because
the
trustee
had
not
paid
the
claim
in
the
first
place,
one
could
argue
that
the
trustee
having
no
interest
and
no
incentive
and
no
ability,
it
simply
could
not
have
happened.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
if
the
trustee
had
wanted
to
do
so
for
free,
certainly
the
trustee
could
have
pursued
the
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
would,
because
the
state
of--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
our
position
is
not
that
the
creditor
can
force
the
trustee
to
do
it.
our
position
is
that
the
creditor
can
pursue
the
claim
directly.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think
perhaps,
your
honor,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
trustee
has
discretion.
it
would
be
whether
the
trustee
has
the
ability.
in
this
case,
the
trustee
having
no
funds
to
litigate
with
the
secured
party
simply
could
not
pursue
the
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
remedy
here
is
a
remedy
under
the
bankruptcy
laws.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
okay.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
eighth
circuit,
the
en
banc
decision
was
merely
saying
that
the
only
question
here
is
whether
there
is
a
question
under
federal
law.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
panel
opinion,
your
honor,
said
that
we
had
the
right
under
section
506(c).
there
was
no
mention
of
any
alternative
right.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
had
not.
this
is
the
exclusive
means
of
recovery
which
we
are--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
did,
your
honor.
in
this
case
the
assets
in
question
were
operating
businesses...
gas
stations,
restaurants...
and
in
order
to
operate
those
businesses
the
debtor
had
to
have
worker's
comp
insurance
or
it
could
not
operate
at
all,
so
but
for
the
provision
of
the
insurance
there
would
have
been
no
operation.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
that
between
liquidation
value
and
going
concern
value
of
the
gas
station.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
you
never
get
to
506
unless
you
go
through
503.
503
allows
the
administrative
expense
and
creates
a
class
of
administrative
expense
claimants.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
there
is
no
dispute,
your
honor,
that
our
claim
was
allowed
as
a
proper
administrative
expense.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
506(c)
articulates--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--a
priority
for
certain
claims.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
your
honor,
in
this
case
it's
undisputed
that
our
claim
provided
a
benefit
to
the
secured
party,
and
the
reason
that
it
did
was
because
the
value
which
the
bank
realized
from
the
sale
of
these
businesses
as
a
going
concern
was
actually
much
greater
than
the
value
that
they
would
have
received
if
the
gas
station
had
shut
down.
picture
the
storage
tanks
under
a
gas
station
which
is
not
operating
or
generating
revenue.
typically,
those
operations
sell
for
very
little
money.
if,
however,
you
have
an
operating
store,
and
some
of
these
stores
are,
in
fact,
still
operating,
but
with
different
owners,
the
value
is
much
more,
so
the
bank
got
the
benefit
of
the
difference
in
value
because
the
debtor
was
able
to
operate
in
a
going
concern
value
and
those
values
were
preserved.
that
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
purposes
of
chapter
11.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
honor
should
understand
that
the
trustee
and
creditors
are
adversaries,
and
that
it
would
not
be...
it
would
be
unseemly
in
the
least
for
a
creditor,
who
is
adversary
to
a
trustee,
to
have
to
hire
the
adversary
to
pursue
the
creditor's
claims.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
our
client
did
not
even
know
of
the
bankruptcy.
the
debtor
concealed
that
fact
from
us,
so
we've
continued
to
provide
the
services
without
knowledge
of
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
it
was
authorized,
your
honor,
but
in
the
chapter
11
context
it
doesn't
quite
work
that
way.
what
happens
is
that
when
the
debtor,
who
is
in
possession
of
all
of
the
estate,
the
case
is
filed,
the
debtor
continues
to
operate
as
it
had.
section
1108
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
for
the
continued
operation
of
the
businesses,
and
the
ordinary
expenses
which
the
debtor
would
incur
in
operating
the
businesses
continued
to
be
paid.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that...
expenses
that
are
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course,
the
debtor
is
authorized
by
statute
to
continue
to
incur
those
expenses,
and
in
this
case
what
we
have,
your
honor,
is
an
involuntary
creditor.
we
have
the
insurance
company
who
provided
insurance
because
the
debtor
could
not
get
it
in
the
market,
and
it
was
an
assignment
through
the
assigned
risk
pool,
so
as
an
involuntary
creditor
hartford
had
to
continue
to
provide
the
insurance.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
once
the
premiums
were
not
paid,
the
hartford
then
went
and
issued
a
default
notice
to
the
debtor--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
for
a
period
of
time,
yes,
because--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--contractually
there
is
a
30-day
notice
period
before
the
policy
can
be
cancelled.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
what
the
contract
provides.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
what
happened
during
that
period
of
time
was
that
initially
a
part
of
the
premium
was
paid
when
the
application
for
the
insurance
was
submitted,
so
that
was
covered
for
a
period
of
time.
the
way
these
policies
work--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
believe
it
was
over
$25,000.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if
we
had
known
about
the
chapter
11,
perhaps
we
could
have
done
that,
but
we
did
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
did
not
find
out
until
after
the
policy
was
terminated,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
your
honor,
what
happened
was
that
they
tendered
their
application
with
part
of
the
premium,
and
then
the...
a
period
of
time
went
by.
premiums
are
calculated
on
an
audit
basis,
meaning
the
debtor
has
to
submit
their
payroll
reports
to
the
insurer.
then
the
insurer
calculates
the
premiums
based
upon
the
number
of
persons
who
are
employed
times
a
certain
rate.
the
debtor
in
this
case
neglected
to
send
those
monthly
reports,
so
hartford
sent
an
auditor
in.
the
auditor
conducted
the
audit,
went
back
to
hartford,
hartford
calculated
the
premium
and
then
sent
a
demand
to
the
debtor.
the
debtor
paid
part
of
the
premium.
now,
all
of
this
took
a
lot
of
time
to
happen.
after
the
debtor
paid
a
part
of
the
premium,
the
second
installment,
in
addition
to
the
one
that
was
with
the
initial
application,
it
was
not
enough
to
carry
through
the
term,
but
by
the
time
the
hartford
went
and
said,
you
haven't
paid
the
full
amount,
we
were
30
days
away
from
the
termination
of
the
policy,
so
it
was
too
late
to
cancel.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
when
the
trustee...
the
trustee--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
best
reading
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
on
its
plain
meaning,
is
that
the
trustee,
when
the
trustee
expends,
then
the
trustee
recovers.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
under
prior
practice,
that
was
not
necessarily
the
rule.
under
prior
practice,
trustees
could
recover
whether
they
expended
or
not,
and
individual
claimants
could
recover
whether
they
expended
or
not,
and
the
problem
that
the
court
faces--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--somebody
has
to
be
out
some
dollars
before
they
can
recover,
and
it
has
to
be
an
administrative,
allowable
administrative
expense
before
you
get
to
506(c).
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
doesn't,
of
course,
tell
us
what
to
do
when
the
trustee
has
not
expended
and
the
individual
claimant
is
out--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--where
the
trustee
has
paid
out
cash--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor,
and
that
has
always
been
the
uniform
rule
in
the
federal
courts
including
as
articulated
by
this
court.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
applies
in
almost
every
single
case,
your
honor,
in
one
way
or
another,
where
there
is
a
secured
party.
the
problem
that
we
face,
your
honor,
is
that
in
some
cases--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct,
but
that
presupposes,
your
honor,
that
the
trustee
paid
the
expense
first,
and
that
presupposes
the
trustee
had
funds,
unencumbered
funds
to
pay
these--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it
is
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it
is
the
logical
situation,
the
paradigm
which
congress
seemed
to
have
had
in
mind,
and
now
what
we
must
do
is
fill
in
the
gap
for
the
part
that
congress
didn't
seem
to
have
in
mind,
and
so
the
question
becomes,
do
we
follow
the
pre-code
practice
to
fill
the
gap?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
poznan
case
was
an
admiralty
case,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
case
which
we
rely
on
from
this
court,
the
wilson
case,
i
think
quite
clearly
addressed
the
specific
problem
and
provided
the
specific
solution
that
we're
seeking.
in
the
lower
court
decisions,
as
the
bankruptcy
laws
evolved
up
to
the
point
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
those
courts
relied
on
wilson
for
the
proposition
that
the
administrative
claimant
has
the
right
to
come
to
the
court
and
have
its
claim
paid
when
it
has
not
been
paid,
and
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
a
case
involving...
bear
with
me
for
one
minute,
your
honor.
it
is
the
louisville
case,
louisville
storage
company
case,
21
f.
supp.
at
897,
where
the
court,
citing
wilson,
said,
quote,
it
has
always
been
the
rule,
inherent
in
general
principles
of
equity,
that
the
lienholder
must
bear
the
expense
of
bankruptcy
administration,
which
is
solely
for
his
benefit,
or
to
which
he
consents,
or
to
which
he
causes,
and
there,
and
in
those
other
cases
relying
on
wilson,
the
courts
would
allow
on
occasion
the
unpaid
administrative
claimant
to
come
forward
and
have
their
claim
paid.
so
wilson
is
the
lodestar,
in
a
sense,
and
the
lower
federal
courts
followed
it.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
was
uniform.
there
were
no
opinions
to
the
contrary,
and
the...
this
practice,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
is
more
established
than
the
pre-code
practice
which
this
court
was
willing
to
accept
in
midlantic
for
the
proposition
that
a
trustee's
power
to
abandon
carries
with
it
the
corollary
that
the
trustee
cannot
abandon
in
violation
of
certain
health
and
safety
requirements
under
applicable
state
law.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
rule,
i
think,
is
one
which
initially
five
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
eighth
circuit
changed
its
mind,
had
adopted
and
the
courts
had
no
ability
administering.
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence,
your
honor,
that
congress
intended
to
change
the
practice.
in
fact,
the
only
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
intended
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
so
there's
no...
there
being
no
evidence
of
an
intent
to
change,
the
presumption,
i
think,
is
that,
and
properly
so,
given
the
nature
of
what
we're
talking
about,
the
bankruptcy
laws,
that
the
pre-code
practice
endures.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if
the
trustee
has
paid
the
claim
from
unencumbered
funds
of
the
estate,
and
the
trustee
then
seeks
to
recover
it
from
the
secured
party's
collateral,
and
the
trustee
is
basically
replenishing
the
estate
and
then
the
funds
would
be
distributed,
but
in
that
situation,
of
course,
the
administrative
claimant
is
paid
in
full--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it
would
go
to
us
if
we
were
the
only
section
506--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
those
claimants'
claims
are
not
entitled
to
the
priority
that
section
506(c)
provides.
if
those
claims
did
not
provide
a
benefit
to
the
secured
party--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--oh,
if
they
did,
and
they
were
properly
also
506(c)
claimants--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--if
those
other
claimants'
claims
were
determined
ultimately
by
the
court
to
be
entitled
to
506(c),
we
would
share
with
other
506(c)
claimants.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand,
your
honor,
that
in
the
bankruptcy
case
the
timing
of
when
claims
are
presented
is
not
what's
important.
at
the
end
of
the
case,
after
all
claims
have
been
cut
off
by
a
bar
date
and
then
determined,
those...
that
is
when
the
distributions
can
be
made.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if
they
have
506(c)
rights,
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
all
506(c)
claimants
are
equal.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
506(c)
only
applies,
your
honor,
to
post
petition.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
court
answered
that
question
in
meyer
v.
flemming--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
the
answer
is
that
of
course
the
lawsuit
should
not
be
allowed
to
lapse.
the
creditor
can
come
and
bring
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--conceivably--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--notice
is
required,
your
honor.
it
should
have
been
done.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case
to
the
hartford,
so
the
hartford
was
without
notice.
but
let's...
assuming
that
hartford
had
notice,
what
could
hartford
have
done?
well,
being
an
involuntary
creditor,
and
having
to
provide
insurance
as
long
as
the
premium
was
paid,
very
little,
and
hartford's
relief
is
section
506(c).
just
like
when
the
united
states
comes
in
and
cleans
up
an
environmental
site
post
petition,
and
the
cleanup
of
the
site
benefits
the
secured
party
by
increasing
the
value
of
the
collateral,
the
united
states
in
that
situation,
courts
have
recognized,
can
then
come
to
court
and
say,
the
trustee
has
not
paid
our
administrative
expense
for
cleanup
because
the
trustee
has
no
unencumbered
funds
to
do
so
and
the
courts
have
said,
well,
you
may
surcharge
the
collateral
to
the
extent
that
it
benefited
the
secured
party.
now,
if
that
were
not
the
rule,
and
the
trustee
had
no
funds
to
pay
the
united
states'
cleanup
cost,
then
essentially
the
united
states
would
be
subsidizing
the
recovery
of
the
secured
party,
who
would
walk
away
with
the
full
value
of
the
collateral,
having
the
benefit
of
the
cleanup
cost,
but
not
have
to
pay
that
cost
from
the
collateral,
and
this
court's
principle,
which
is...
it's
articulated
in
burnham
v.
bowen,
in
wilson,
a
whole
line
of
cases,
is
that
that
is
not
the
bankruptcy
rule.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
during
the
case...
the
stores
were
sold
during
the
course
of
the
chapter
11
case.
in
fact,
that
was
planned
from
the
beginning.
in
our
appendix
there
is,
at
one
of
the
pull-outs
that
we
have,
which
shows
the
budget
and
what
the
parties
were
to
expend,
listed
at
the
top...
and
this
is
page
175a...
you
will
see
at
the
top,
stores
to
close,
and
this
was
the
exhibit
that
was
attached
to
the
order
on
the
first
day
of
the
bankruptcy,
and
it
shows
that
there
were...
identifies
a
number
of
stores
to
be
closed,
and
in
fact
a
number
of
the
stores
were
closed
and
sold
as
going
concerns,
and
the
bank
realized
the
proceeds
from
those
sales,
so
the
bank
got
the
benefit
of
the
going
concern,
and
our
simple
point
is
that--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--after
the
stores
were
sold--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
believe
all
of
them.
there
may
have
been
one
or
so,
but--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
all
of
them
were,
your
honor.
yes,
all
of
them
were.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
506(c)
codified
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
of
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
what
should
come
with
506(c)
is
the
undisputed
established
pre-code
practice.
there
is
no
contrary
precedent,
contrary
to
wilson.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
bankruptcy
codifies
in
section
553
rights
of
set-off.
that
says
nothing
about
rights
of
recoupment,
yet
in
bankruptcy
that
was
an
established
right
and
this
court
in
ritter
v.
cooper
said
it's
well-settled
that
recoupment
applies
in
bankruptcy,
so
this
court
in
construing
the
bankruptcy
laws
has
not
been
shy
about
incorporating
and
recognizing
its--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
actually
the
opposite
is
true,
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
rule
that
the
administrative
claimant
can
come,
which
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
right
of
the
trustee.
the
general
principle
is
the
same.
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
bankruptcy
proceedings
are
in
rem,
and
that
the
bankruptcy
court,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
adair
case,
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court,
the
bankruptcy
court
to
see
to
it
that
the
in
rem
assets,
which
are
in
custodia
legis,
are,
in
fact,
distributed
properly.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
adair
is
the
case,
your
honor,
which
articulated
the
rule
which
we're
relying
on
here,
the
general
rule
that
the
administrative
expenses
must
be
paid
out
of
the
secured
party's
collateral
to
the
extent
of
the
benefit
and
the
court...
it
would
i
think
be...
lead
to
an
absurd
result
to
say
that
if
the
trustee
doesn't
come
to
court,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
no
authority
to
allocate
the
charges
properly,
and
if
the
bankruptcy
court
has
authority
to
do
so,
any
party
in
interest
in
the
case
should
be
able
to
come
to
court
to
say
to
the
court,
this
is
how
it
must
be
done.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
your
honor's
reading
is
the
correct
reading.
in
response
to
your
honor's
prior
question
i
think
it
was...
my
response
was
that
pre-code
practice
allowed
either
way.
i
think
your
honor's
reading
is
the
best
reading,
and
that
the
administrative
claimant,
following
pre-code
practice,
can
come
to
court
when
the
trustee
has
not
paid
the
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
under
what
section,
your
honor?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
the
bank...
under
pre-code
practice,
the
lower
courts
often
would
invoke
this
rule
as
a
gloss
on
the
court's
power
to
allow
administrative
claims
in
addition.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
neither
does
the
doctrine
of
recoupment,
your
honor,
or
the
doctrine
of
ear-marking
or
substantive
consolidation,
and
those
are
all
equitable
doctrines
which
endure
under
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it
does,
your
honor,
because
506(c)
clearly
recognizes
that
expenses
of
the
kind
which
we
are
talking
about
are
chargeable
against
the
secured
party's
collateral,
and
the
question
in
an
in
rem
bankruptcy
proceeding
where
we're
simply
talking
about
dividing
up
assets,
who's
going
to
get
what,
the
question
is,
can
a
party
in
interest
come
to
court
and
say,
this
expense
should
be
put
in
this
bucket,
or
moved
here,
because
the
trustee
has
no
incentive
or
ability
to
come
to
court
to
say
it
should
be
so.
and
where
the...
because
the
bankruptcy
court
has
the
power
under
105,
under
its
general
equitable
powers,
which
this
court
recognized
recently
in
the
energy
resources
cases
to
be
quite
broad,
to
allocate--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
506(c)
recognizes
that
the
expense
of
the
kind
which
we
are
talking
about
here
is
chargeable.
all
we
are
saying
is
simply,
the
court
should
adopt
the
gloss
which
the
courts
adopted
pre-enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
individual
claimants,
parties
at
interest,
unpaid
administrative
claimants
can
come
to
court
and
say,
the
trustee
won't
act,
we
get
to
have
this
particular
expense--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
court,
under
506(c),
following
pre-code
practice,
could
rule,
and...
i
think
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
your
honor,
whether
you
rely
on
506(c)
directly
or
on
pre-code
practice,
but
i
think
that
you
can
rely
on
section
506(c).
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
you
can.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
