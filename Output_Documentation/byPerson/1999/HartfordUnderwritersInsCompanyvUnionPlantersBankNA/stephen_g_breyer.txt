justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
pre-petition
if
a
debtor
has
a
huge
claim
against,
say,
general
motors
that
requires
a
lawsuit,
let's
say,
millions
of
dollars,
and
the
trustee,
thinking
it
isn't
that
great
a
claim,
won't
bring
the
lawsuit--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
creditor,
who's
a
big
creditor--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thinks
i'd
certainly
like
this
money
in
the
estate--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
him
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
what
happens?
can
the
creditor
sue
general
motors
directly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
creditor
can
bring
his
own
lawsuit
in
that
case
for
the
benefit
of
the
estate
because
the
trustee
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
that's
really
the
same
principle
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
happens
in...
i
don't
know
that
that
meyer
case
really
answers
the
question,
but
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
pre-petition,
a
pre-petition
debtor,
the
pre-petition
debtor
has
a
giant
claim
against
general
motors,
a
lawsuit--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
trustee
doesn't
bring
the
claim,
and
one
of
the
creditors
says,
i'd
like
to
bring
it.
now,
meyer
dealt
with
the
case
of
the
debtor
having
filed
the
suit,
not
a
creditor.
it
could
be
taken
as
authority
for
the
creditor.
so
what
happens?
is
it
the
case
that
creditors
in
such
circumstances
simply
go
and
bring
their
own
lawsuits
in
the
name
of
the
estate
instead
of
the
trustee
doing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
do
for
my
own
purposes
is
to
find
an
analogy,
and
i
know
it's
a
rough
analogy,
but
i
would
like
to
know
just
for
my
own
purposes
what
happens,
and
it
must
happen
often,
of
when
a
trustee
doesn't
bring
a
lawsuit
to
get
some
money
for
the
estate,
that
a
big
creditor
thinks
he
ought
to
bring.
does
bankruptcy
normally
work...
this
can't
be
unusual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
such
circumstances
there
are
two
possibilities.
one
is
that
you
bring
a
suit
to
sue
the
trustee
and
make
him
do
it.
another
possibility
is,
you
bring
your
own
lawsuit
but
it...
somehow
you're
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
trustee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both
exist.
all
right.
if
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
if
that's
so
in
that
circumstance,
why
shouldn't
that
be
so
in
this
circumstance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
in
your
view
as
a
bankruptcy
lawyer,
if
they
had,
i
mean,
is
that
a
good
way
to
resolve
the
problem?
you
say,
look,
you're
a
creditor.
you're
a
post
petition
creditor.
you
have
a
right
to
get
your
money,
but
you'll
have
to
go
first
to
the
trustee,
because
otherwise
there
are
going
to
be
those
leeches,
you
know,
or
there
are
going
to
be
all
these
people
running
around.
is
that
a
good
resolution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
that
if
the
trustee...
the
trustee
himself
goes
and
brings
this
lawsuit
against
justice...
she
can
do
it.
i
mean,
the
trustee
can
do
this
under
506(c).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
say,
collects
$10
million,
which
happened
to
be
the
cost
of
the
contracted-for
clean-up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
there's
$10
million
in
the
trustee's
hand.
now,
there
are
another
$20
million
of
administrative
expenses
that
were
not
related
to
preserving
the
property.
now,
does
that
$10
million...
does
the
trustee
give
that
$10
million
to
the
toxic
waste
contractor
that
helped
to
preserve
the
property,
or
does
that
toxic
waste
contractor
get
only
one-third
and
two-thirds
has
to
go
to
these
other
administrative
claimants
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
preserving
the
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
all
right.
i
don't
object
to
find--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
there's...
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
mm-hmm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
this
is
a
bigger--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
so
the...
(c)
has
as
its
purpose
simply
getting
money
from
the
secured
creditor
into
the
estate.
it
doesn't
have
as
its
purpose
giving
that
money
to
the
people
who
incurred
the
expense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wow.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
was
the
prior
practice?
was
the
prior
practice
that
when
the...
our
secured
toxic
waste
person...
nonsecured,
sorry.
the
toxic
waste
person
sues
against
the
collateral,
and
apparently
can
get
the
money.
did
that
toxic
waste
person
get
to
keep
the
whole
thing,
or
did
the
toxic
waste
person
have
to
put
it
in
the
estate
and
share
it
with
the
other
nonrelated
administrative
claimants?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it
wouldn't
have
been
toxic
waste.
what
i
mean
is,
a
person--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
506(c)...
a
506(c)
creditor,
and
then
there
are
non-506(c)'s,
but
503(a)
creditors,
and
when
the
506(c)
creditor
brought
the
suit...
i
know
there
wasn't
a
506(c)
at
that
time--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
mean,
that
kind
of
a
person
brings
the
suit,
collects
the
$10
million,
did
he
get
to
keep
the
whole
$10
million,
or
did
he
have
to
throw
it
in
the
pool
and
he
only
got
one-third
and
the
non-506(c)
administrative
creditors
got
two-thirds?
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
is
quite--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
would
you
want
to
allow
such
a
person,
i.e.,
a
506(c)
person,
to
get
from
the
secured
creditor
money
that
he
isn't
going
to
keep
and
he
in
fact
is
going
to
give
to
two
other
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who,
vis-a-vis
the
secured
creditor,
shouldn't
get
it?
