well,
here,
congress
said
the
trustee--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--can
bring
it,
and
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
creditor,
so
maybe
that's
a
change.
i
mean,
it's
pretty
clear
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
this
just
looks
like
pretty
clear
language.
did
your
client
ask
the
trustee
to
take
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
curious
about
a
prior
question
about
what
506(c)
covers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
text
of
506(c)
says
the
trustee
may
recover
from
property
securing
an
allowed
secured
claim
the
reasonable,
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
or
disposing
of
such
property,
and
i
think
we're
dealing
here
with
workman's
comp--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--premiums
that
were
incurred
after
the
original
chapter
11
proceeding
was
begun--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
an
attempt
to
keep
the
business
going.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
a
cost
and
expense
of
preserving
the
real
property,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
put
it
this
way.
i'm
not
sure...
i
mean,
if
your
client
had
been
hired
to
go
paint
the
building,
or
to
repair
the
plumbing,
i
can
understand
how
it
would
fit
under
506(c),
but
to
incur
an
expense
for
paying
these
premiums
for
workman's
comp
to
run
the
business,
as
opposed
to
actually
enhancing
the
real
property
or
the
building,
i'm
not
sure
i
see
how
it
fits
under
506
at
all--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--instead
of
503(a).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
presumably
your
client
is
within
that
general
category.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
just
want
to
go
now
against
the
real
property
because
that's
the
only
thing
there
is,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
why
doesn't
it...
isn't
it
limited
to
something
that
actually
enhances
the
property
as
opposed
to
the
broader
503
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
not
the
insurer
have
said
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
debtor
is
in
chapter
11,
i'm
not
going
to
be
at
risk,
put
up
the
whole
thing
in
front?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
soon
as
you
found
out
about
it,
couldn't
you
say,
at
this
point
we
stop
until
you
pay
the
premium
in
advance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
could
hartford
have
done
here
to
protect
itself?
i
mean,
what's
conceivably--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--out
there
to
protect
hartford?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
no
notice
required
to
be
given
to
people
post
petition
in
a
chapter
11?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
this
property...
was
the
business
ultimately
sold
as
a
going
concern
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
could
hartford
have
avoided
losing
its
claim
here,
do
you
think,
if
there
was
something
that
was
obtained
when
the
business
was
sold
as
an
ongoing
business,
and
assuming
that
the
workman's
comp
insurance
somehow
benefited
the
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
you
can
seek
what
is
known
in
many
of
the
cases
as
derivative
standing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
ever
used
in
these
administrative
expense
areas,
that
section,
510?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
brownlee,
what
about
the
suggestions
that
petitioner
made
of
the
clean-up
costs,
or
even
the
government.
it's
an
ongoing
operation,
and
there
are
tax
liabilities.
she
said
that
your
position
means
that
a
good
samaritan,
or
a
government
agency
who
comes
in
and
cleans
up
the
toxic
junk
gets
nothing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
government
would
get
no
tax.
how
do
you
deal
with
those
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he...
i'm
addressing...
i
don't
remember
precisely
how
he
put
it
in
his
brief.
i'm
sure
you
focused
on
it,
so
you
remember
better
than
i
do.
he
talked
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
clean-up
costs
that
could
be
incurred
by
a
private
contractor
or
by
a
government
agency
to
decontaminate
the
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this...
it
has
to
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
my
question
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
brownlee--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--my
question
is
related,
and
it
seemed
to
me
in
reading
the
text
of
506(c)
and
503
that
not
every
administrative
expense
under
503(a)
would
fit
under
506.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
506
is
limited
to
the
reasonable,
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
or
disposing
of
the
secured
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
presumably
some
wages
and
salaries
don't
fit
under
that.
maybe
some
insurance
premiums
don't
fit
under
that.
it
would
depend
on
what
it
was.
am
i
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
mean,
i
could
see
that
506(c)
would
be
related
to
things
like
painting
the
building,
or
paying
the
real
estate
commission
to
sell
it.
is
that
right?
