mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
don't
know
if
it
would
make
any
difference
in
the
justices'
rulings,
but
i'd
like
to...
my
friend
and
colleague
mr.
brunstad
misspoke
on
a
couple
of
questions,
one
i
believe
by
justice
kennedy.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that,
because
i
think
it
was
the
first
question
in
the
argument,
where
hartford
indicated
it
had
asked
the
trustee
to
proceed
and
the
trustee
had
refused.
in
the
blue
brief
at
page
5,
note
4,
it
is
stated,
hartford
did
not
request
the
trustee
to
pursue
its
claim
under
section
506(c)
because
the
law
in
the
eighth
circuit
as
it
existed
at
that
time
permitted
administrative
claimants
to
pursue
such
claims
on
their
own
behalf,
citing
the
boatmen's
case,
which
was
overruled
by
the
eighth
circuit.
in
fact,
not
even
that
is
really
so.
when
the
boatmen's
case
was
decided,
the
one
that
was
overruled
in
this
case,
the
issue
was
at
contest
in
the
hartford
v.
magna
case,
magna
being
the
predecessor
of
my
client,
so
i
believe
mr.
brunstad
misspoke
in
response
to
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
justice
o'connor,
hartford's
policies
were
such
in
this
case...
you
can
look
at
the
record
below...
that
it
did
not
know
that
it
was
insuring
a
debtor
for
a
period
of
some
15
months
or
so.
the
one
thing
hartford
could
have
done,
i
believe,
although
i
don't
intend
to
tell
them
how
to
run
their
business
in
any...
and
i
don't
mean
this
in
any
way
derogatorily
or
in
a
pejorative
manner...
would
have
been
to
have
some
procedures
in
place
so
that
they
would
have
known,
even
though
the
debtor...
i
have
no
evidence
that
the
debtor
did
notify
them.
bankruptcy
is
and
always
has
been
somewhat
creditor
emptor,
and
it
is
true
in
this
case
that
there's
no
evidence
that
hartford
was
actually
notified.
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
on
the
record
below
that
hartford
knew
that
it
had
a
series
of
quarterly
bills
that
were
going
unpaid,
and
so
it
couldn't
have
found
out.
had
hartford
known
earlier,
before
the
case
was
converted
to
a
7,
and
before
the
case
was
in
a
total
liquidation
mode,
hartford
could
have
come
to
court,
hartford
could
have
asked
to
terminate
the
policy
based
on
nonpayment,
at
least
cut
its
losses,
and
also
hartford
could
have
tried
to
take
steps
to
persuade
the
bankruptcy
court
perhaps
while
there
were
still
funds
in
the
estate
to
allow
it
within
an
administrative
claim
and
force
the
payment
of
that
claim.
bankruptcy
has
a
lot
to
do
with
timing,
especially
in
a
reorganization
case
that's
going
downhill.
hartford
in
fact
is
correct
that
it
did
not
know
until
substantially
later.
if
the
justice's
question
is,
how
could
hartford
have
protected
itself
after
the
fact,
once
we
got
to
march
of
1993,
or
whatever
the
record
will
show
the
date
was
that
it
learned,
hartford
cannot
protect
itself
under
506(c),
i
submit.
506(c)
says
the
trustee
may
recover.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
okay.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
well,
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
just
observe
first
of
all
in
the
meyer
case,
it's
my
reading
of
the
meyer
case
that
while
the
court
allowed
the
principle
of
the
second
debtor
to
proceed
with
the
prefiled
proof
of
claim
in
the
first
bankruptcy,
it
was
clear
that
any
recovery
would
be
on
behalf
of
the
estate,
which
is
not
something
that
hartford
seeks
here.
hartford
seeks
a
nonshare.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
it's
not
unusual.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
both
exist.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
you
can
file
a
motion--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
compel
the
trustee
to
act--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
because
in
this
circumstance
hartford
didn't
follow
that
procedure.
hartford
didn't
ask
the
trustee
to
act.
hartford
didn't
ask
the
bankruptcy
court
to
force
the
trustee
to
act,
and
hartford
didn't
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
having
made
a
record
on
that
subject
and
said,
you
know,
somebody
needs
to
sue
union
planters
because
we
think
there's
a
pretty
good
506(c)
claim--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--well,
justice,
it's
not
the
leeches
issue,
it's
the
quality-of-distribution-among-creditors-of-equal-rank
issue.
if
the
trustee,
who
is
clothed
under
506(c)
with
the
responsibility
to
pursue
this
right,
this
action
to
obtain
funds
that
were
otherwise
the
property
of
the
secured
creditor,
either
doesn't
proceed
in
her
own
behalf,
or
there
isn't
a
court
order
that
allows
whatever
surrogate,
hartford
or
whomever,
to
proceed
in
the
name
of
the
estate
and
on
behalf
of
the
estate,
then
you're
going
to
have
a
circumstance
where
that
recovery
is
going
to
be,
as
hartford
seeks
here,
kept
to
itself
and
not
shared
with
other
creditors
of
equal
rank.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
there
is
none.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i'm
not
aware
of
a
statutory
basis,
justice,
for
derivative
standing.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
the
bankruptcy
courts
have
developed
a
body
of
law
wherein
they
will...
some
will
grant
what
is
called
derivative
standing,
and
the
cases
are
cited
in
the
briefs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
best
example
of
them
is
in
the
amici
for
the
petitioner,
when
the
aia
and
the
national
union
suggests
that
even
under
the
preference
section
and
the
fraudulent
conveyance
sections,
which
also
start
with
the
words,
the
trustee
may
recover,
that
there
are
cases
which
have
allowed
third
parties--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--justice,
i
don't
think...
i
know
that
this
court
doesn't
need
to
decide
whether
derivative
standing
is
appropriate
on
a
nation-wide
basis
for
us
to
win
this
case,
because
i
don't
think
this
court
should
hold,
and
i
hope
it
doesn't
hold
the
506(c),
the
word
trustee
means
anything
other
than
trustee.
i
don't
think
you
should
hold
that
it
means...
because
i
don't
think
there
is
any
established
pre-code
practice
and,
if
there
were,
the
statute
is
sufficiently
clear.
it
shouldn't--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--i
understood
asked
me
a
factual
question,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
mean
to
argue
with
you.
in
practice,
and
i'm
in
the
trenches
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
than
i'm
in
the
appellate
courts,
in
practice
bankruptcy
courts
will
occasionally,
if
a
trustee
refuses
to
act,
call
a
creditor
or
another
party
with
the
right
to
act
in
the
estate's
name
on
behalf
of
the
estate
to
pursue
the
claim
if
the
court
feels
that
it
should--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--in
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--in
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
now,
there
is
another--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--right.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
don't
precisely
disagree
with
the
way
it's
phrased,
justice
souter.
you're
basically
right.
hartford
would
have
had
to
get
a
court
order
that
said,
that
established
the
trustee
was
not
proceeding--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--i'm
not
here
to
argue
whether
derivative
standing
is
the
right
approach.
every
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--because--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--no,
because
if
hartford
recovers
it
has
to
share
with
all
other
creditors
of
equal
rank.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
if
you
could
hear
me
for
a
minute
on
that.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
believe
your
question
earlier
to
mr.
brunstad
was
pre-conversion
or
post
conversion,
and
his
answer
was
pre-petition
or
post
petition.
those
are
big
differences.
there
aren't
any
administrative
creditors
pre-petition.
pre-conversion
and
post
conversion--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--in
an
11
that
goes
to
a
7,
there
can
be
a
bundle
of
administrative
creditors
on
both
sides.
in
fact,
under
726(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
post
conversion
administrative
creditors
in
fact
do
have
a
priority,
so--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--while
he
says
there
wouldn't
be
any
others,
that's
not
so--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--he
did
misspeak.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
if
you
are
in
a
district
where
a
judge
will
allow
derivative
standing
in
the
name
of
the
trustee,
that's
correct,
because
506(c)
talks
about
an
action
to
recover
by
the
trustee.
the
bankruptcy
court
in
a
number
of
districts
will
allow
that.
in
a
number
of
districts,
some
bankruptcy
courts
are
critical
of
that.
but
in
any
event,
hartford
came
here,
and
there
has
been
i
think
a
shift
in
the
briefs,
quite
frankly,
as
i
understand
the
argument,
or
maybe
i
just
misperceived
it.
hartford
came
here
on
the
merits
briefs
to
ask
the
court
assembled
to
rule
that
under
506(c)'s
meaning,
506(c)
could
deemed
to
say,
the
trustee
may
recover,
da-da,
da-da,
comma,
and
any
unpaid
administrative
creditor
may
also
recover
under
this
section,
and
if
that
unpaid
administrative
creditor
does
recover
under
this
section,
it
will
have
a
super
priority
claim
over
all
other
administrative
creditors
as
described
in
section
507(a).
now,
that's
a
big
mouthful,
but
from
a
little
section
that
says
the
trustee
may
recover,
for
hartford
to
win
on
the
merits
briefs,
all
those
things
i
just
said,
i
respectfully
submit,
have
to
be
engrafted
onto
a
simple
statute
that
gives
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
under
limited
circumstances
as
defined
under
the
merits
the
right
to--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--it
does
not,
justice
stevens,
and
i
did
not
have
the
case
below--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--i
can
tell
you
this,
justice
stevens...
i
did
not
have
the
case
below,
so
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
something
i
don't
know,
obviously.
we
called
up
from
the
archives
the
final
report.
the
final
report
doesn't
say,
so
i
can't
tell
you
that.
i
can
tell
you
that
union
planners'
predecessor
had
a
$4
million
loan,
we
lost
a
million
and
a
half
in
principal,
all
of
our
interest,
and
all
of
our
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
if
there
was
any
other
administrative
creditor
in
the
case,
they
didn't
get
paid.
now,
whether,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
another
group
there
is
unknown.
intuitively,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
hartford
went
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
make
this
end
run
if
it
was
the
only
unpaid
administrative
creditor,
because
it
could
have
made
a
simple
demand
on
the
trustee
and
taken
its
shot
for
derivative
standing,
and
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
something
else--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--go
ahead,
justice
stevens.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
they
satisfied
the
requirements
of
503(a)
in
that
they...
i'm
trying
to
think
which
is
which.
they
made...
in
the
same
motion
that
they
sued
under
506(c),
they
made
a
request
for
payment
of
their
administrative
claim,
and
i
believe
they
made
a--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--yes,
and
i
made...
i
believe
they
made
a
request
for
allowance
and
payment.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
so
i...
it's
my
belief
that
they
did
follow
503
at
least.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
well,
let
me
try
to
respond
to
that.
503(a)
says
you
can
file
a
request
for
an
administrative
claim
or
you
can
file
a
request
for
a
payment
of
it,
and
that's
fine.
i
mean,
any
creditor
ought
to
be
able
to
file
a
proof
of
claim.
unsecured
creditors
can.
secured
creditors
can.
i
certainly
couldn't
imagine
why
administrative
creditors
shouldn't
be
allowed
to.
anybody
can
ask
for
payment
from
the
estate,
but
503
talks
about
a
direction
to
the
estate
to
seek
payment.
creditors
can't
typically
sue
secured
creditors
as
if
they
could
sue
outside
under
state
law,
to
go
back
to
a
question
you
previously
asked,
justice.
within
the
bankruptcy,
the
bankruptcy
code's...
i
believe
the
court's
language
in
some
cases
in
looking
at
plain
meaning
has
been
a
consistent
and
coherent
scheme,
has
been
that
creditors
deal
with
the
estate,
and
the
estate
deals
with
creditors.
hartford
wants
to
deal
with
us.
they
want
to
call
us
outside,
and
they
don't
have
any
way
to
do
that
except
to
make
the
argument
that's
made
on
the
merits
briefs
and
partially
made
today,
although
there
may
have
been
a
shift
in
argument,
that
they
can
do
it
under
506(c).
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
congress
was
not
totally
unmindful
when
it
adopted
the
code
of
the
possibility
that
inter...
that
there
might
be
intercreditor
fights
under
some
circumstances,
under
some
hypotheticals.
in
fact,
congress
enacted
section
510,
and
in
510(c),
which
is
the
equitable
subordination
section,
the
congress
said
that
on
application
to
a
court,
after
noticing
a
hearing,
the
court
can
subordinate
all
or
part
of
one
creditor's
claim
to
all
or
part
of
another
creditor's
claim,
or
give
the
lien
to
the
estate
if
it
wanted,
under
general
principles
of
equitable
subordination.
now,
the
rule
isn't
the
same
as
the
substantive
rule
the
trustee
must
meet
to
recover
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
and
benefit
of
the
creditor
under
506(c),
but
510(c)
does
provide
a
remedy,
but
hartford
wasn't
willing
to
share.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
it's
used
a
lot
in
winner
liability
type
claims,
or
any
kind
of
claim
where
you've
got
some
sort
of
equitable
misconduct,
justice
o'connor.
i
have
not
personally,
and
i...
that
doesn't
mean
it's
not
used,
and
i
have
not
researched
the
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
do
not
know
how
often
it
is
used.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
well--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--well,
in
the
first
place,
in
terms
of...
and
i
gather
your
question
is,
a
volunteer
comes
along
post
petition
and
cleans
up
the
property,
which
directly
benefits
the
property,
or
the
secured
creditor.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
well,
if
the
case
is
in
a
chapter
7,
the
case
is--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--okay.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
if
the
case
is
in
chapter
11,
and
the
debtor
hires
a
private
contractor
to
come
in
and
clean
up
dirty
property,
and
that
contractor
does
it,
and
the
court
finds
that
the
reasonable
and
necessary,
all
of
that
is
met,
which
it
obviously
sounds
like
on
those
facts,
most
bankruptcy
courts
would
find
that,
and
the
estate
becomes
insolvent,
and
the
contractor
has
not
protected
itself
and
gotten
paid,
then
the
contractor
is
his
administrative
claimant
in
the
bankruptcy
and
is
treated
of
equal
rank
with
all
others,
and
if
that's
unfortunate,
and
that
means
the
statute's
broke,
then
the
congress
ought
to
fix
the
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i'm
not
aware,
justice
ginsburg,
of
any
super
priority
for
administrative
creditors
inter
se
under
the
507
priorities
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
except
for
the
one
that
hartford
asks
you
today
to
judicially
engraft
onto
a
statute
which
only
provides
for
the
trustee
to
recover.
i'm
not
aware
of--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
okay.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
it's
even
worse,
justice
breyer.
first,
the
trustee
takes
the
trustee's
fees
and
expenses
and
expenses
of
counsel
off
the
top--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--and
then
it
goes
two-thirds,
one-third.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
am
not
aware
of--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--unless
there--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--make
sure
i
don't
misspeak
as
an
officer
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
unless
there
is
some
federal
statute
that
grants
a
priority
outside
of
bankruptcy
to
clean
up
contractors
because
of
the
importance
of
the
environmental
laws,
where
you'd
have
a
clash
between
federal
statutes.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i'm
not
aware
of
a
bankruptcy
priority.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
oh,
no,
your
honor.
distribution--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--is
governed
by
726--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--in
a
liquidation.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
am
not
sure
that
i'm
aware
of
a
toxic
waste
case
pre--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--certainly
not
in
the
1800's.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
didn't
mean
to
be
cute.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
my
best
answer,
and
i
don't
want
you
to
think
this
is
a
dodge,
because
i
don't
mean
it
to
be,
is
it's
my
understanding
of
the
pre-code
practice
was
that
it
was
all
over
the
lot
in
terms
of
the
equitable
rule--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--what
the
judges
decided
to
do.
we
cited
at
page
44
of
the
red
brief
an
article
by
toth
which
recounts
some
of
the
history
to
the...
the
article
itself
is
in
the
west
new
england
law
review.
it
recounts
a
lot
of
the
history
to
the
predecessor
to
506(c),
and
in
that
article
it
concludes
that,
as
collier's
did
in
1978,
which
we
also
cite
on
that
page,
that
there
was
no
firmly
established
rule
as--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--because--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--because,
justice...
because
of
the
equality
of
distribution
rules
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
there
are
administrative
claim
creditors,
and
there
is
not
a
super
priority
that
says
you're
a
506(c)
creditor,
because
creditors
don't
have
the
right
to
pursue
the
action
under
506(c).
congress
never
intended
506(c)--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--to
be...
allow
you
to
bring
that
case.
it
was
for
the
trustee
only,
so
a
fortiori
it
was
to
be
distributed
to
all
the
creditors
of
equal
rank,
and
that's
what
congress
decided
in
1978.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
yes,
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
your
honor,
i
know
you're
way
past
this,
but
i
wished
at
one
point
you'd
been
a
bankruptcy
judge
in
our
district.
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
but
some
courts
will
find
an
implied
benefit,
or
find
some
reason--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--to
try
to
toss
these
things
into
506(c)
on
the
merits.
that's
not
the
case
here
we're
talking
about.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
if
this
action
had
been
brought
by
the
trustee--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--we
fought
it
below.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
and
we
lost.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i
don't
think
we'd
lose
in
every
court.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
for
the
purpose
of
this
case--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--you're
absolutely
right.
yes,
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
well,
if
every
administrative
creditor
qualified
to
be
a
surcharging
creditor
under
the
standards
of
506(c)--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--but
you're
assuming
every
administrative
creditor
in
the
estate
does
so
qualify,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
hypothetically
is
an
interesting
question--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--but
it
doesn't
happen
in
practice.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
to
the
extent
that
that
assumption
is
true,
if
every
administrative
claim
in
a
case
qualifies
for
a
surcharge...
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
and
the
trustee
refuses
to
act,
which
is...
i
won't
go
into
the
inconceivability
of
that,
because
it
would
be
such
a
large
claim
that
very
few
trustees
would
not
be
highly
incentivized,
but
if--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--if
it
was
a
large
case
the
trustee
would
be
fixing
to
get
unbroke
very
quickly
when
she
won,
but
i
don't
mean
to
argue.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
under
that
assumption,
the
trustee
refuses
to
act,
the
bankruptcy
court
refuses
to
direct
the
trustee
to
act,
the
bankruptcy
court
refuses
to
appoint
a
new
trustee
who
will
act,
and
the
bankruptcy
decides,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
without
any
direct
statutory
authority,
to
grant
derivative
standing,
and
the
hartford
brings
the
claim
in
the
name
of
the
estate
on
behalf
of
all
the
administrative
claims
in
the
estate,
and
wins
on
the
merits
of
the
individual
little
lawsuits
it
will
have
to
prove
reasonable,
necessary,
direct
benefit,
secured
creditor,
if
that's
the
hypothetical,
then
yes,
they'll
recover
and
you'll
avoid
the
one-third,
two-third
problem.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
in
practice?
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
i'd
call
the
bank.
i'd
bypass
the
bankruptcy
court
entirely.
i'd
call
the
bank
and
say--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--i'd
call
the
bank
and
say,
you're
building's--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--going
to
fall
in
and
it's
your
collateral.
you
want
to
give
me
the
money,
i'll
fix
it,
and
if
you
don't,
i'll
stand
by
and
take
a
picture
of
it
while
it
falls
in.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
absolutely,
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
there
is
a
line
of
authority,
justice
scalia,
and
it
may
be
the
better
one.
it
can
be
traced
to
the
statement
in,
i
believe,
the
floor
reports
in
the
legislative
history
that's
in
the
briefs,
where
there's
a
reference
to
the
moneys
that
the
trustee
has
expended,
or
some
phrase
to
that
effect.
it
escapes
me,
the
precise
phrasing.
it's
that
really
506(c)
isn't
intended
to
collect
unpaid
administrative
claims.
it's
intended
only
for
the
trustee
to
bring
an
action
to
recover
those
administrative
claims
that
the
trustee
has
paid
out
that
justify
to
tag
the
bank
to
bring
it
back
in
and--
mr.
robert
h.
brownlee
--split
up
the
deficiency.
that
opinion
was
adopted
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
k
&
l
lakeland
in
the
fourth
circuit,
but
as
i
read
that
opinion
there
wasn't
enough
votes
in
the
fourth,
even
though
the
fourth
is
a
jkj
circuit,
which
was
the
other
circuit
on
our
side,
other
than
this
case,
which
i
hope
is
affirmed
at
the
end
of
this
argument,
to
make
that
part
of
circuit
law.
this
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
today,
but
i
would
agree
with
the
justice
that
that
is
a
strong
read
of
the
real
congressional
meaning
of
the
words,
but
the
plain
meaning
of
these
words
fit
if
you
want
to
include
an
attack
on
unpaid
administrative
claims.
it
just
makes
it
real
complicated,
and
it
makes
for
the
kinds
of
questions
that
we've
discussed
today.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice--
