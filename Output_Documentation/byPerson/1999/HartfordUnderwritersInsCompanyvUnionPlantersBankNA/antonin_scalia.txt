mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brunstad,
i
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
about
section
506,
which
is
on
page
2
of
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
the
trustee
may
recover
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
or
disposing.
now,
i
assume
that
he
can't
recover
them
until
they've
been
expended.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
reasonable
reading
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
also
a
reasonable
reading
of
it
that
he
can't
recover
them
unless
he
has
expended
them?
i
mean,
i'm--
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
trustee--
--well,
but
that's
not
the
position
you're
taking.
in
response
to
other
questions
here,
you
have
assumed
that
the
trustee
could
sue
to
recover
money
that
he
didn't
expend
but
that
you
expended.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
somebody
else
had
expended.
i
mean,
somebody
has
to
have
expended.
you
acknowledge--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
agree
that
the
most
straightforward
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
the
trustee
can
recover
any
money
that
he's
expended--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
securing
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
all
the
more
so
if
you
interpreted
506(c)
as
allowing
the
trustee
to
recover
only
those
expenses
that
he
has
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
case
gets
harder
if
you
read
506(c)
to
say
that
the
trustee
may
also
recover
on
your
behalf
expenses
that
you've
paid.
i
don't
read
it
that
way,
but
you
apparently
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
on
what
basis
does
the
trustee
have
the
right
to
sue
for
money
that
the
trustee
hasn't
expended?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it’s
your
lucky
day,
this
is
not
a
bankruptcy
case.
it
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
arises
out
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
of
a
company
called
hen
house
interstate.
during
its
attempted
reorganization
pursuant
to
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
hen
house
obtained
workers’
compensation
insurance
from
petitioner
hartford
underwriters.
although
hen
house
repeatedly
failed
to
make
the
monthly
premium
payments
required
by
the
policy,
hartford
continued
to
provide
the
insurance.
the
reorganization
ultimately
failed
and
the
court
converted
the
case
to
a
chapter
7
liquidation
proceeding
and
appointed
a
trustee.
learning
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
after
the
conversion
and
recognizing
that
the
estate
lacked
encumbered
funds
to
pay
the
premiums,
hartford
attempted
to
charge
the
past
two
premiums
to
respondent
union
planter
bank’s
security
interest
pursuant
to
11
u.s.c.
section
506(c).
the
bankruptcy
court
ruled
for
hartford
and
the
district
court
affirmed,
but
the
en
banc
eighth
circuit
reversed,
concluding
that
section
506(c)
could
not
be
invoked
by
an
administrative
claimant
such
as
hartford.
we
affirm.
as
an
administrative
claimant,
hartford
is
not
a
proper
party
to
seek
recovery
under
section
506(c)
which
provides,
“the
trustee
may
recover
from
property
securing
an
allowed
secured
claim,
the
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
or
disposing
of
such
property.”
the
statute
appears
quite
plain
in
specifying
who
may
use
section
506(c),
namely
the
trustee.
although
the
statutory
text
does
not
explicitly
state
the
persons
other
than
the
trustee
may
not
seek
recovery
under
506(c),
several
contextual
features
support
that
conclusion.
first,
a
situation
in
which
a
statute
authorizes
specific
action
and
designates
a
particular
party
in
power
to
take
that
action
is
surely
among
the
least
appropriate
in
which
to
presume
non-exclusivity.
second,
the
fact
that
the
sole
party
named,
the
trustee,
has
a
unique
role
in
bankruptcy
proceedings,
makes
it
entirely
plausible
that
congress
would
provide
a
power
to
him
and
not
to
others.
further,
had
congress
intended
the
provision
to
be
broadly
available,
it
could
simply
have
said
so
as
it
has
done
in
describing
the
parties
who
can
act
under
other
sections
of
the
code.
hartford’s
argument
that
section
506(c)
is
not
exclusive
because
it
does
not
use
the
word
‘only’,
or
rather
expressly
restrictive
language
is
therefore
unpersuasive.
hartford
argues
that
pre-code
practice
supports
its
reading,
but
it
is
questionable
whether
the
pre-code
precedents
establish
a
bankruptcy
practice
sufficiently
widespread
and
well-recognized
to
justify
the
conclusion
of
implicit
adoption
by
congress.
in
any
event,
whereas
here,
the
meaning
of
the
code’s
text
is
itself
clear,
its
operation
prevails
over
contrary
prior
practice.
the
court’s
opinion
is
again
unanimous.
