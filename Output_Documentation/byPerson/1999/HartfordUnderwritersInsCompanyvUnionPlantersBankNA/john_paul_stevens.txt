mr.--
--does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there
are
other
administrative
creditors
now
competing
for
this
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
had
understood
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
was
the
only
administrative
creditor,
and
that
in
no
event
would
there
be
money
available
for
any
other,
either
general
creditors
or
post
petition
creditors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
let
me
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
other
question.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
they
did
satisfy
the
requirements
of
503(a)
and
(b)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
bankruptcy
judge
allowed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
position...
it's
a
very
difficult
case,
but
the
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
position
is,
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
503(a)
and
(b)
meaningless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
wait
a
minute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
let's
clarify
one
thing
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
had
agreed
that
if
this
action
had
been
brought
by
the
trustee,
because
the
trustee
had
expended
this
very
money,
506(c)
would
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
fact
that
it's
insurance
premiums
doesn't
distinguish
it
from
paint
on
the
buildings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
lost
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
for
the
purposes
of
our
decision--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
assume
that
this
is
just
like
paint
on
the
buildings
or
something
like
that.
