mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
massachusetts
law
challenged
in
this
case
is
similar
to
the
selective
purchasing
policies
adopted
by
many
states,
cities,
and
private
institutions
in
the
1980's
regarding
south
africa.
through
the
1980's
and
1990's,
congress
addressed
both
south
africa
and
burma,
but
took
no
action
to
expressly
prohibit
to
the
states
or
individuals
the
right
to
make
choices
about
their
vendors
taking
into
account
matters
involving
a
foreign
country.
we
think
that
congress
has
not
expressly
denied
to
us
the
right
to
make
this
choice,
because
it
believes,
as
we
do,
that
these
laws
serve
important
national
and
local
interests.
there
is
a
national
interest
in
vigorous
debate
over
important
questions
of
foreign
policy.
there
is
a
local
interest
as
well,
the
interest
in
disassociating
states
and
state
tax
funds
from
the
indirect
support
of
brutal
regimes
abroad.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
not
if
the
law
regulated
our
citizens
in
that
way,
but
if
it
were
expending
our
own
funds,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
we
would
consider
that
to
be
proprietary
as
well
under
our
definition.
we
quickly
add
that
we
don't
think
it
would
be
a
usual
case
at
all,
given
the
comity
and
respect
each
state
ordinarily
shows
each
other.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
we
think
there,
and
the
difference
with
gould
and
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
the
court
saw
a
nexus
between
the
regulatory
scheme
imposed
by
federal
law
and
the
state
action
that
was
at
issue.
to
give
the
court
an
example
of
what
might
be
closer
to
gould
than
our
case
would
be
if
massachusetts
had
somehow
tied
its
purchasing
decisions
to
violation
of
the
federal
ban
on
new
investment
in
burma.
there,
there
might
be
more
of
a
nexus
between
the
regulatory
scheme
on
the
one
hand...
we
think
it
was
the
close
connection
between
the
wisconsin
scheme
on
the
one
hand
and
the
federal
complete
scheme
of
regulation
of
the
labor
field
that
made
the
court
decide
that
we
were
regulatory
in
nature.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
country
wouldn't
matter,
your
honor,
except
insofar
as
some
federal
law
or
treaty
established
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
country--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--that's
right,
except
insofar
as
a
plausible
argument
could
be
made
that
we
were
preempted
by
a
federal
law
or
treaty
on
the
point.
that
really
is
the
heart
of
our
case,
that
absent
the
force
of
enacted
law
through
the
supremacy
clause,
such
a
choice
by
a
state
should
not
be
displaced
by
the
foreign
commerce
clause
or
the
dormant
foreign
affairs
power.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that's
right,
your
honor.
at
some
point
the
differing
policies
becomes
to
the
attention
of
congress,
and
congress,
which
has
the
preeminent
voice
in
foreign
affairs,
would
decide
whether
the
national
interest
requires
a
rule
of
uniformity,
but
absent
that
action,
or
absent
some
question
of
a
treaty,
the
states
would
be
free
to
act
indirectly
in
this
way.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
if
i
might
address
both
of
those
points,
your
honor,
the
first
is
on
the
question
of
the
proliferation
of
these
laws.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
we're
acting
against
our
own
economic
interest
here.
massachusetts
is
paying
the
price,
bearing
the
burden
to
speak
out
on
this
question.
since
that's
the
case,
our
principle
will
be
limiting,
because
it
will
limit
those
instances
in
which
a
state
or
local
government
which
is
to
act
against
its
own
interest
and
act
in
the
way
that's
challenged
here.
furthermore,
congress
will
be
aware,
presumably,
in
the
event
that
a
controversy
arises
due
to
the
conflicting
actions
of
the
states
as
you
mentioned,
and
it's
also
worth
noting,
finally,
on
the
proliferation
question,
that
even
at
high
tide
in
the
eighties
with
south
africa
it
was
20
states,
approximately
100
cities,
so
i
think
the
parade
of
horribles
that's
raised
by
the
other
side
here
about
the
numerous
jurisdictions
isn't
realistic.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
it
has
enacted
a
law
imposing
federal
sanctions
on
burma--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--restricting
new
investment
by
american
nationals
in
that
country.
it
says
nothing,
however,
about
state
and
local
action,
and
we
think
the
question
of
preemption--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--yes,
your
honor,
but
we
think
that
the
key
phrase
from
our
point
of
view
and
hines
would
be
the
reference
to
a
complete
scheme
of
regulations
that
was
in
issue
there
in
hines.
that
is,
the
inference
that
the
field
has
been
occupied
by
the
federal
action,
that
the
federal
action
here
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
experience
of
the
1980's.
our
point
is
that
congress
knew
well
that
state
and
local
actions
of
this
type
were
enacted
throughout
the
country
in
the
1980's.
then,
when
the
question
of
sanctions
against
burma
arose
in
1996,
it
acted
against
that
backdrop.
it
had
tolerated
these
types
of
laws
and,
in
fact,
and
we
think
this
very
interesting
evidence,
in
1993,
when
congress
repealed
the
sanctions
against
south
africa,
it
merely
encouraged
the
states
to
act
as
to
their
own
laws.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
the
federal
government
would
be
run
by
congress
stepping
in
in
the
event--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--the
action's
still
proprietary,
your
honor.
it's
still
a
choice
by
the
state
acting--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--that's
right,
because
of
the
safeguard
included
in
the
document
to
allow
congress
to
act
in
the
event
the
national
interest
required.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
right,
but
the
holdings
of
the
court
regarding
market
participation
say
that
whatever
the
effects
of
such
a
law,
whatever
the
question
of
national
interest
or
uniformity,
the
dormant
foreign
commerce
clause
in
that
case
is
not
displacing
of
that
type
of
state
choice.
it
resembles
that
consumer
choice.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
it
is
different
to
the
hypothetical,
but
the
underlying
point,
of
course,
both
as
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause
in
the
hypotheticals
and
the
foreign
commerce
clause
that's
at
issue
here,
is
that
those
dormant
clauses
don't
reach
a
certain
limited
sphere
of
state
activity
in
which
the
states
can
speak
and
act
as
they
have
here.
that's
really
the
point
of
our
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
we
concede
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
cases
such
as
barclays
some
foreign
effect.
our
point
here
is
that
it
must
be
considered
and
applied
with
extreme
caution
in
this
case.
that's
because,
to
return
to
the
historical
point,
the
framers
specifically
identified
those
actions
of
a
state
that
pose
dangers
in
their
view
to
the
national
interest,
so--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--i
think
this
case
shows
why
that
presumption
goes
too
far.
that's
because,
although
i
acknowledge
the
national
interest
in
the
control
of
foreign
policy
that's
at
the
heart
of
your
question,
this
case
demonstrates
why
such
a
presumption
would
go
too
far.
there
has
to
be
a
sphere
of
state
activity
so
important
to
the
states
to
speak,
to
act,
to
disassociate
their
funds
from
this
type
of
regime
that
the
framers
intended
to
be
protected,
so
as
you
come
to
the
question
of
presumption,
it
seems
to
me
a
similar
question
to
the
effect
of
the
dormant
foreign
affairs
powers.
that
is,
is
there
a
sphere
of
state
activity
such
as
a
resolution,
such
as
a
selective
purchasing
law,
so
close
to
the
boycotts
that
the
framers
knew
so
well,
that
ought
to
be
protected?
the
presumption
would
go
too
far,
just
as
it
would
operate
in
this
case.
it
would
simply
be
the
fact
that
federal
government
has
acted
as
to
burma
with
federal
sanctions,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
story,
and
this
particular
case
also
is
a
demonstration
why
the
presumption
would
be
dangerous.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
you'd
have
to
go
back
under
our
research
only
to
the
revolutionary
times.
in
the
interim
there
were
no
such
actions.
i
think
the
eighties--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--the
eighties
is
what
we
have
in
mind.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that's
right,
and
they
included--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--and...
but
we
have
a
different
approach,
though,
as
to
the
boycotts
in
particular.
there's
such
a
strong
match
here
between
the
boycotts
of
the
revolutionary
times
and--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
before--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--well,
it
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
framers
in
adopting
the
foreign
affairs
clauses,
your
honor,
and
the
question
would
be,
since
the
framers
enumerated
a
number
of
prohibitions
regarding
treaties
and
engaging
in
war
and
so
forth,
we'd
have
to
ask
ourselves
the
question,
do
the
affirmative
grants
of
power
to
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
in
the
constitution
have
a
nullifying
force
implied?
that
is,
to
what
extent
does
the
grant
to
congress
and
the
president
nullify
other
state
actions
that
affect
foreign
affairs,
and
there
we
come
to
the
revolutionary
times,
because
the
framers,
who
knew
boycotts
well,
who
held
them
dear,
did
not
enumerate
them
as
prohibited,
and
we
say
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
to
deny
to
the
states
the
rights
that
they
knew
were
useful
and
they
knew
were
so
bound
up
with
questions
of
speech
and
choice.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
i
think
that
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
was
very
limited
global
trade
for
those
years.
there
was
limited
information
available
to
state
governments
about
other
activities
in
foreign
states.
this
is
a--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--well,
i
don't
know
why,
your
honor,
but
of
course
once...
in
times
of
war
the
federal
government
does
act
to
establish
a
rule
of
uniformity.
whether
that
has
to
do
with
neutrality
or
aiding
a
resistance
group,
there's
a
new
set
of
rules
that
would
kick
in
which
aren't
disturbed
by
our
rules.
that
is,
you
need
not
be
concerned
that
actions
of
this
type
would
be
aid
of
one
side
or
another
in
a
war,
because
there
is
a
specific
prohibition
in
article
i,
section
10,
that
the
states
may
not
engage
in
war.
so,
too,
congress
often
acts.
the
president
sometimes
declares
that
countries
are
in
a
state
of
war,
and
so
neutrality
is
preserved
through
the
action
of
the
federal
branch
with
authority
to
determine
the
national
rule
of
uniformity,
but
of
course
we
argue
here
that
branch
hasn't
acted.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
of
course
we
agree
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
speak
in
that
way,
but
we
don't
think
the
rule
is
sufficient
for
this
reason.
we
think
that
it
leaves
us
open
to
the
indirect
support,
through
the
use
of
our
money,
the
companies
that
are
doing
business
in
the
country.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
clear
our
conscience,
because
our
conscience
is
based
on
so
much
history.
to
allow
us
to
feel
that
we
were
indirectly
supporting
what's
going
on
in
burma
would
be
so
contrary
to
the
principles
that
underlie
our
own
state
constitution,
which
refers
to
unalienable
rights,
the
point
of
view
of
massachusetts
that
it
has
universal
rights
at
stake
here--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--well,
it
will
always
depend
on
the
circumstances
in
the
foreign
country.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
as
a
matter
of
state
law
we
would
be
bound
to
accept
the
proposals
of
bidders
for
state
contracts.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
we
wouldn't
have
a
choice,
provided
that
the
people
otherwise
qualified
for
the
bid.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
state
law
governing
procurement.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
we'd
still
be
here.
we'd
be
here
in
the
event
that
an
executive
official
had
decided
that
state
law
was
broad
enough
to
take
into
account
the
fact
the
companies
were
doing
business
in
burma.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
there's
no
clash
in
the
preemption
sense,
your
honor,
because,
of
course,
the
u.s.
sanctions
are
both
unilateral
and
multilateral.
the
state
sanctions
don't
clash
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
by
congress,
in
its
choice
as
to
the
federal
sanctions,
but
the
1996
federal
statute
cannot
be
looked
at
outside
the
context
of
the
1980's
and
the
law
i
referred
to
in
1993,
that
essentially
what
we're
urging
here,
your
honor,
is,
it's
unreasonable
to
conclude
on
this
question
of
conflict
that
we
have
been
preempted
in
light
of
the
history
that's
gone
before.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
we
need
to
disassociate
as
a
practical
matter
because
of
the
financial
interconnections
among
the
companies,
but
beyond
that,
we
need
to
disassociate
through
the
boycott
of
that
type
because
the
question
of
boycott
would
entail
action
both
against
the
country
that
you
hypothesized
and
people
who
do
business
there.
under
the
court's
precedent
in
zschernig,
in
other
words,
the
secondary
boycott
as
you
describe
it
is
less
indirect,
so
we
think
in
the
area
of
law
in
which
we're
operating,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
concerned
about
effects
on
international
affairs,
a
secondary
boycott
is
a
reasonable
means
because
it's
indirect.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--it's
not
a
first
amendment
right
per
se,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
such
a
case
that
you
mentioned,
but
it
has
to
do
with
the
values
that
underlie
the
nature
of
the
action
here,
which--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--we
assume
so.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
i'd
say
no,
your
honor,
absent
a
clear
delegation
from
the
legis--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--no.
there
needed
to
be
a
clear
statement
from
congress
to
act
in
that
instance,
although
congress
has
delegated
to
the
president
important
powers
in
foreign
affairs
in
the
past.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
question,
or
the
reason
why
foreign
officials
have
visited
boston
in
the
last
few
years,
and
i
must
point
out
a
federal
statute
not
previously
mentioned
in
the
argument
today,
which
is
the
federal
law
adopting
the
uruguay
round
agreements
under
the
gatt.
we,
through
the
united
states,
has
now
been...
we
have
been
purported
to
have
been
held
to
a
new
round
of
international
trade
agreements.
the
foreign
complaints
that
you've
heard
described
are
complaints
under
that
agreement.
our
point
is
simply
that
in
this
new
world
of
global
trade
and
new
international
agreements,
this
type
of
contact
will
be
common.
this
type
of
complaint
against
massachusetts
and
the
other
states
that
the
procurement
laws
violate
gatt
will
be
all
the
common.
there
will
be
contact.
it's
not
a
realistic
approach
that--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
as
the...
if
the
focus
is
on
the
effects
of
our
law,
the
court
should
not
give
great
weight
to
the
fact
that
foreign
countries
have
objected
to
the
massachusetts
law
under
a
trade
agreement
that's
been
ratified
by
congress.
we
take
that
agreement
to
mean,
and
the
congressional
action
to
mean,
that
congress
knows
full
well
that
states
will
have
complaints
made
against
them
of
this
type.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
means...
that's
why
we
urge
the
court,
under
both
of
those
constitutional
provisions,
to
recognize
what
we've
described
as
a
market
participation
exception.
that's
why
we've
argued
that
the
boycott,
so
close
in
nature
to
that
type
of
state
activity,
was
not
within
the
thought
of
the
framers
as
to
either
of
those
dormant
clauses.
that's
the
way
to
handle
this,
to
preserve
to
the
states
a
limited
sphere
of
activity
which
has
speech
components
and
consumer
components.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
those
questions
will
remain
for
congress.
under
our
rule
they
would
be
proprietary.
we
can
only
hope,
though,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
there
is
a
comity
owing
between
sister
states
that's
not
owing
to
the
government
of
burma,
certainly,
and
massachusetts
has
the
right
in
this
instance
to
exercise
that
proprietary
power,
that
limited
sphere
of
power
cabined
as
historical
basis
for
assuming
that
the
framers
did
not
intend
to
take
the
boycotts
out
of
the
hands
of
the
states,
just
as
we
know
the
power
of
boycott
remains
in
the
hands
of
every
american
citizen.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
i
acknowledge
that,
your
honor,
and
i
point
to
the
'94
law
and
the
gatt
simply
to
say
that
this
will
be
common
in
our
view.
state
and
local
laws,
not
of
human
rights
dimension,
but
all
kinds
of
laws
will
be
subject
to
attack
by
foreign
governments
under
these--
