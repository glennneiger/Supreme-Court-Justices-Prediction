justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
california
could,
under
our
decisions,
decide
to
buy
textbooks
only
from
california
manufacturers.
could
it
do
that,
in
its
purchasing?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
so
that's
just
as
destructive
of
national
unity
in
a
way,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
there
were
in
the
revolutionary
times,
weren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
virginia
passed
laws
that
prevented
the
collection
of
british
debts,
and
there
was
litigation
over
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
that
state
law
didn't
exist,
i
presume
that
if
we
said
that
massachusetts
can't
do
this
by
action
of
its
legislature,
we
would
also
say
that
massachusetts
can't
do
it
by
action
of
its
governor,
the
governor
simply
deciding,
oh,
you
know,
yes,
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
legislature
can't
bar
these
companies
from
our
contracts,
but
just
as
my...
in
my
capacity
as
governor
i'm
not
going
to
let
any
contracts
to
these
people.
that
would
be
invalid
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
undertake
this
subjective
inquiry
in
every
case,
what
was
the
purpose
of...
let's
assume
a
state
has
a
law
against
bigamy,
and
the
king
of
some
muslim
country
is
visiting
the
united
states.
he
wants
to
stay
in
that
state,
and
the
state
says,
i'm
sorry,
you
know,
you
can't
bring
your...
you
know,
any
more
than
one
of
your
wives--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
he
takes
umbrage
at
this,
and
it's
going
to
seriously
impede
our
relations
with
this
foreign
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
state
enforce
its
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
to
look
at
the
motive.
justice
antonin
scalia
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
state's
motive
can't
be
to
influence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
this
is
quite
neutral,
just
like
the
bigamy
law.
we
don't
buy
from
anybody
who
violates
human
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it
that
prevents
the
states
from
making
foreign
policy
decisions,
in
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
dealt
with.
congress,
everybody
concedes,
can
pass
a
law.
if
the
horrible
occurs
that
you
have
50
states
doing
these
things
and
upsetting
foreign
relations,
congress
can
pass
a
law
and
stop
it.
isn't
that
enough
to
solve
the
problem
that
they
were
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
where
was
it
addressed?
i
don't
see
any...
in
fact,
i
see
provisions
in
the
constitution
prohibiting
the
states
from
entering
treaties
with
foreign
countries,
from
engaging
in
war,
from...
let's
see,
entering
into
any
treaty,
alliance,
or
confederation.
all
of
these
things
would
have
been
unnecessary
if
there
is
some
overriding,
unexpressed
principle
in
the
constitution
that
the
states
cannot
get
involved
in
foreign
affairs.
you
wouldn't
need
these
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
the
solicitor
general
takes
a
different
view,
i
gather,
in
the
brief
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dyk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
ware
v.
hilton,
which
involved
the
virginia
laws
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
erected
obstructions
to
the
collection
of
debts
by
english
creditors,
and
hostility
towards
england
after
the
revolution?
a
federal
case,
involved
a
challenge
to
those
laws.
no
one
asserted
that
the
laws
were
invalid
because
virginia
had
no
authority
to
muck
around
in
foreign
affairs.
the
entire
case
was
argued
and
decided
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
treaty
with
england
forbade
this,
and
it
was
accepted
that
if
the
treaty
did
not
forbid
it,
the
virginia
laws
were
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
handled
it
by
a
treaty...
by
a
treaty,
which
the
constitution
expressly
says
the
states
must
respect,
but
there's
no
provision
there
that
the
states
can't
do
anything
that
affects
foreign
affairs.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
also
article
vi,
of
course.
without
a
treaty,
congress,
if
it
passed
a
law,
could
pass
a
law
that
would
be
the
law
of
the
land
that
would
prevent
the
states
to
do
it,
but
certainly
those
two
protections
are
entirely
adequate
to
prevent
all
of
the
horribles
that
we're
concerned
about,
that
the
states
are
going
to
go
running
off
with
our
foreign
affairs
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
a
problem,
the
remedy
is
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
shouldn't
turn
upon
the
coercion.
i
mean,
if
we
can't...
if
states
cannot
muck
around
in
foreign
affairs,
i
assume
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
governor
of
new
york
could
not
condemn
the
policies
of
south
africa,
or
the
policies
of
nazi
germany.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
the
coercive
sanction?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
interfere
with
our
foreign
affairs
to
have
50
state
governors
going
around,
you
know,
condemning
adolph
hitler
as
a
fiend
if,
indeed,
the
federal
government
is
trying
to...
i
don't
know,
accommodate
him,
or
whatever?
rehabilitate
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
50
state
legislatures,
not
just
the
governors.
50
state
legislatures
with
the
signature
of
the
governor
pass
a
bill
saying
taiwan
is
independent
from
china.
50
state
legislatures.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question
is
whether
they
were
trying
to
avoid
it
by
giving
congress
the
power
to
prevent
it,
which
everybody
concedes
they
have
here.
if
this
is
indeed
a
big
deal,
a
big
problem,
nobody
questions
that
under
article
vi
congress
can
pass
a
law
which
massachusetts
would
have
to
obey,
but
the
question
is,
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
suggests
that
the
president,
by
snapping
his
finger,
can
make
massachusetts--
