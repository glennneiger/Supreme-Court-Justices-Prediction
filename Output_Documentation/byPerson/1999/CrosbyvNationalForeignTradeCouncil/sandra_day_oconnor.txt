mr.
barnico,
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
massachusetts
decided
it
didn't
like
another
state's
death
penalty
policy
and
wanted
to
discourage
it
and
said,
we're
not
going
to
let
anybody
spend
state
money
to
buy
anything
if
the
seller
has
anything
to
do
with
the
other
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
here
congress
has
actually
enacted
a
law
dealing
with
this
precise
problem,
an
area
of
trade
with
burma,
has
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
isn't
that
kind
of
similar
to
what
happened
in
the
hines
v.
davidowitz
case
back
in
'41,
when
pennsylvania
had
a
law
dealing
with
what
resident
aliens
had
to
have
to
be
in
that
state,
and
it
was
possible,
certainly,
for
a
resident
alien
to
comply
both
with
the
federal
law
and
the
state
law,
and
yet
that
was
stricken,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
there
is
a
dormant
commerce
clause
principle
in
the
international
area
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--without
enacting
something
with
the
purpose,
can
it
just
spend
its
money
the
way
it
wants
and
buy
from
the
suppliers
that
it
wants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
dyk,
how
does
your
theory
play
out
in
the
context
of
the
eighties,
when
a
number
of
states
were
adopting
investment
policies
designed
to
encourage
a
change
in
south
africa
from
its
apartheid
government
to
a
more
democratic
society?
these
were
widespread
practices
by
states
then,
were
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
how
does
that
play...
the
very
purpose
of
it
was
to
change
something
going
on
in
south
african
government--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
affect
foreign
policy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
it
turns
on
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
happened
during
the
civil
war
years,
if
you
know?
did
states
take
action
to
try
to
not
deal
with
people
who
were
using
slaves?
what
did
they...
weren't
there
actions
taken
by
states
in
those
years
along
the
lines
that
massachusetts
is
taking
now,
or
do
we
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
waxman--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
general
waxman,
congress
has
passed
a
law,
hasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
preemption?
