mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i'd
like
to
follow
up
on
your
suggestion
and
talk
first
about
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
because
i
think
that
what...
the
effect
of
what
massachusetts
has
done
here
in
many
ways
exemplifies
precisely
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
trying
to
accommodate
and
to
accomplish
and
avoid
in
enacting
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
the
problem
that
the
framers
were
addressing
was
first
and
foremost
the
refusal
by
states
in
the
union
under
the
articles
of
confederation
to
honor
debts
that
they
owed
to
british
sympathizers
and
british
citizens
notwithstanding
the
treaty
of
1783,
and
what
massachusetts
has
done
here,
and
the
purpose
therefore
in
the
clause,
was
to
keep
other
states
and
the
union
from
being
held
accountable
for
decisions
and
unilateral
actions
for
which
they
didn't
have
the
responsibility,
and
what
massachusetts
has
done
here
is
precisely
the
same.
the
united
states
has
had
for
a
long
time,
at
least
since
1990,
a
policy
with
respect
to
burma...
and
i
want
to
emphasize
here
that
this
is
a
case
about
means,
not
goals
with
respect
to
the
burmese
regime.
we
have
had
a
policy
that
has
emphasized
in
resolutions,
in
executive
orders,
in
the
federal
burma
act,
and
in
the
president's
1997
executive
order,
the
importance
of
a
coordinated,
multinational
effort,
because
in
the
view
of
the
national
government
it's
the
only
way
we
can
have
an
effective
voice
with
respect
to
burma.
but
massachusetts,
by
choosing
to
extend
sanctions
to
foreign
companies,
has
created
a
considerable
source
of
irritation
with
our
trading
partners
and
our
allies,
and
has
directly
hampered
our
efforts
to
achieve
multilateral
action.
instead
of
our
conversations
with
the
eu
and
asean
and
other
countries
that
had
been
taking
place
about
what
to
do
about
burma,
our
conversations
now
are
what
to
do
about
massachusetts,
and
we
have
been
treated
to
the
spectacle
of
delegations
of
eu
officials
and
other
foreign
officials
writing
to
and
visiting
along
with
our
trade
representatives,
boston,
massachusetts
in
order
to
decide
what
the
best
means
is
to
accomplish
reform
in
burma,
and
i
think
that
that's
just
what
the
framers
were
trying
to
avoid
in
enacting
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
indeed
it
has
passed
a
law,
and
i
guess
rather
than
choosing
favorites
i'll
try
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
think
that
there
is
preemption
under
the
hines-boyle
international
paper
articulation
because,
as
i
was
starting
to
suggest,
the
federal
law...
the
massachusetts
act
stands
as
an
obstacle
to...
i'm
quoting
now
from
many,
many
opinions
of
this
court.
the
test
is,
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress,
and
i've
pointed
out
one
of
three
ways,
and
i
will
elucidate
the
other
two,
if
i
may,
in
which
what
massachusetts
has
done
has
interfered.
now,
justice
scalia,
your
point,
if
i
recall
it,
was
that,
well,
that's
fine,
we
were
really
concerned
about
it
and
we
gave
congress
the
power
to
say,
no,
we
don't
like
that,
you
can't
do
that,
and
i
have...
i
think
that's
incorrect
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
foreign
commerce
clause
of
its
own
force
preempts
state
laws
surely...
and
this
court
has
decided
it
many
times...
that
discriminate
on
their
face
against
a
particular
country.
that
was
a
principle
that
was
elucidated
as...
by
this
court
as
far
back
as
cooley
v.
board
of
wardens,
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
main
objects
of
the
constitution
was,
quote,
preventing
discriminations
favorable
or
adverse
to
commerce
with
particular
foreign
nations
that
might
be
created
by
state
laws,
and
i
know
that
there
is
considerable
uncertainty
about
the
scope
of
the
operation
of
what
has
been
called
the
dormant
foreign
commerce
clause,
but
in
essence
the
scope,
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
commerce
clause
itself,
absent
positive
legislation.
but
there
has
never
been
a
question
from
the
start
that...
with
respect
to
a
law
like
this
that
singles
out
and
punishes
and
sanctions
commerce
with
a
particular
foreign
country,
that
there
is
preemption
by
the
foreign
commerce
clause
of
its
own
force.
now,
secondly,
it
would
be
a
regime
that
would
be
highly
inimical
both
to
the
national
government
and
to
our
states
and
the
federal
system
to
require
congress
or
the
federal
executive
to
expressly
keep
track
of
and
preempt
each
one
of
these
actions,
and
i'd
like
to
just
explain--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
i
think
they
could.
i
believe
that
they
could.
i
don't
think
that
they
could
do
the
converse,
or
i'd
question
whether
they
could
do
the
converse--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
they...
if
i
can
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
in
fact,
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
at
least
with
respect
to
burma,
where
there
is
one
voice,
and
the
voice
has
spoken,
and
the
voice
has
spoken
quite
clearly
with
respect
to
means,
it
is
preempted
in
any
event,
either
by
operation
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause
or
by
the
federal
action.
but
if
i
can
just
go
to
the
point,
justice
scalia's
point
about
what's
so
bad,
what
would
be
so
bad
about
requiring
the
national
government
to
act,
i
would
just
say
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
national
government's
ability
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
and
conduct
foreign
affairs,
it
is
well-known
that...
first,
that
effective
diplomacy
often,
probably
usually
requires
that
things
be
done
and
not
be
done
publicly,
and
expressly,
and
the
austria
example
that
i
think
justice
breyer
gave
is,
i
think
we
are
being
treated
to
a
vision
of
that
point
precisely.
secondly,
as
this
court
recognized
in
curtiss-wright,
and
as
the
iepa
statute
recognizes,
fast
action
is
required
by
the
time...
the
problem
may
have
festered
and
come
to
a
head
by
the
time
the
national
government
can
go
through
the
processes
necessary
to
preempt.
and
i
also
would
say
with
respect
to
federalism
and
the
comity
that
our
system
requires,
that
it
is
a
wholly
unnecessary
irritant
that
would
constantly
come
up
in
the
context
of
our
political
system
if,
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
and
foreign
commerce,
the
national
government
in
order
to
pursue
its...
the
objectives
that
the
constitution
gives
it,
were
required
to
single
out,
now,
massachusetts,
we...
you
know,
we
preempt
what
you
have
done,
and
the
village
of
takoma
park,
we
preempt
what
you
have
done.
the
question
was
raised
earlier
about
the
south
africa
sanctions
which
is,
so
far
as
we
know,
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
the
only
instance,
and
not
only
the
amicus
brief
citing
the
petitioner,
but
all
of
the
scholarly
articles
that
are
cited
in
those
briefs,
we
reviewed,
and
there
are
not
instances
of
governments
acting
in
their
procurement
capacity
to
do
this.
but
in
the
south
africa
example,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
first
that
in
1986...
the
south
africa
case
was
decided
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
1989,
and
i
believe
it's
the
only
decided
case...
that
the...
there
was
a
congressional
resolution,
the
national
congress,
explicitly
allowing
states
to
do
this,
and
there
was
a
provision
in
the
south
africa
law
that
was
passed
that
granted
an
exemption
to
states
engaging,
and
localities
engaging
in
procurement
with
federal
dollars
from
the
general
federal
rule
that
required
that
the
lowest
bidder,
the
lowest
responsible
bidder
get
it.
so
i
think
the
south
africa
example,
to
the
extent
that
it
consists
of
the
only
precedent
that
we
have,
is
highly
distinguishable,
because
here,
in
addition
to
the
point
i
made
about
the
frustration
of
the
national
government's
objective
to
pursue
a
multilateral
strategy,
the
massachusetts
law
is
also
inconsistent,
and
therefore
frustrates
the
objectives
of
the
federal
law
in
two
other
respects.
first
of
all,
and
the
legislative
debates
about
this
couldn't
be
clearer,
congress
considered
much
more
stringent
sanctions.
it
considered
precisely
what
massachusetts
has
done,
and
it
deliberately
chose
what
it
called
a
middle
path,
what
massachusetts...
that
is,
not
to
prohibit
precisely
what
massachusetts
has.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
