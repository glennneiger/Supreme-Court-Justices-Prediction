mr.
barnico,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
analysis
if
the
country
with
which
we
were
dealing
were
not
burma
but,
say,
austria,
or
switzerland?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
a
state
would
be
free
to
decide
what
country
it
believed
is
violating
some
human
rights
norm,
be
it
austria,
be
it
burma?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
that
congress--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnico,
you
mentioned
before
that
this
case
is
different
from
massachusetts,
preferring
itself
as
an
economic
actor,
that
here
it
is
acting
for
reasons
of
foreign
policy,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
has
the
control
power,
but
why
shouldn't
the
assumption
be
that
unless
congress
says,
states,
you
can
do
this,
that
states
can't
once
congress
has
occupied
the
field
at
least
to
the
extent
of
having
its
own
burma
law?
why
shouldn't
the
presumption
be
exactly
the
opposite,
that
is,
no
state
action
unless
congress
gives
them
permission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnico,
you
mentioned
globalization,
and
you
say
that's
why
there's
been
no
action
since
the
colonial
times
up
until
now,
but
one
feature
of
at
least
the
u.s.
burma
law
is
concern
with
the
reaction
of
our
neighbors
in
the
world
community,
the
desire
to
have
multilateral
action,
and
you
know
that
sanctions
have
been
a
controversial
subject.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
for
massachusetts
to
go
it
on
its
own
when
the
united
states
is
saying,
we
want
to
get
together
with
our
world
neighbors
on
that,
isn't
there
a
clash
with
the
authority
that
the
founders
wanted
the
national
government
to
have
to
speak
with
one
voice
on
matters
of
foreign
policy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
sanction
was
considered
and
deliberately
not
done
by
congress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dyk,
may
i
ask
you
about
one
case
of
ours
that's
said
to
be
very
close
to
this,
that
is,
the
barclays
case?
this
court
said,
it's
okay
for
california
to
go
its
own
way,
to
have
its
worldwide
income
tax
measure,
even
though
the
feds
didn't,
and
even
though
most
states
didn't,
and
that
was
okay.
it
has
been
argued
that
this
is
the
same,
that
there's
no
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnico,
are
you
suggesting
that
times
have
changed
so
that
the
national
unit
is
no
longer
responsible
under
international
law
for
its
subunits,
that
the
rest
of
the
world
will
target
their
retaliation
to
massachusetts,
and
the
rest
of
the
united
states
will
remain
unaffected?
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnico,
you
said
there's
comity
among
the
states
and
there's
not
comity
with
burma,
but
it
isn't
burma.
as
you
yourself
recognized,
massachusetts
has
been
visited
by
an
asean
delegation,
by
an
eu
delegation,
so
it's
the
rest
of
the
world
of
which
we
are
a
part
that
may
disagree
strongly
on
the
efficacy
of
sanctions.
