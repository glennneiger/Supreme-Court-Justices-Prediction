mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
thing
i
think
to
make
clear
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
massachusetts
law
is
that
the
district
court
explicitly
found,
based
on
massachusetts
concessions...
and
that's
reflected
at
page
81
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
was
to
condemn
burma
and
to
change
the
domestic
policies
of
that
nation,
and
the
mechanism
that
massachusetts
has
chosen
to
accomplish
that,
as
justice
breyer
mentioned,
is
a
coercive
secondary
boycott,
the
kind
of
action
which
no
private
individual
would
engage
in,
and
that's
undisputed
in
the
record
if
you
look
at
pages
32
and
560
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals.
massachusetts
has
$2
billion
in
purchasing
power
every
year.
if
it
joined
together
with
the
other
states
and
municipalities,
the
estimates
in
the
briefs
are
that
there's
$700
billion--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
assume
that
that
question
is
is
it
compelled
to
do
business
with
myanmar
if
it's
not
attempting
to--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--communicate
a
foreign
policy?
well,
there's
no
obligation
to
deal
with
any
particular
country,
but
if
it
tries
to
make
foreign
policy
by
saying,
we're
doing
this
to
condemn
myanmar
to
change
its
policies--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
stevens,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
thing.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
it
could
do
that.
the
question
is,
is
it
trying
to
influence
the
government
of
a
foreign
country,
and
that's
the
essence
of
foreign
affairs.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
trying
to
influence
it
and
attaching
consequences
to
it,
in
the
sense
that
they're
using
one
of
the
tools
of
foreign
policy.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
justice--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
if
it
has
a
neutral
law
like
that
and
it's
not
designed
to
target
a
foreign
country--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
a
very
different
question.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
motive.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
objective,
and
what
you
have
with
these
selective
purchasing
laws
is
an
objective.
they
only
work
if
you
communicate
disapproval,
or
communicate
a
desire
to
change.
it's
not--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
that
that...
if
they
said,
we
don't
buy
from
anybody
who
violates
human
rights,
that
again
looks
like
a
foreign
policy
decision.
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
foreign
policy
decision
that
the
united
states
government
makes
repeatedly.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
first
of
all
the...
to
go
back
to
the
questions
that
you
and
the
chief
justice
had,
before
the
constitution
was
adopted,
states
went
their
own
way
on
sanctions,
and
that
was
a
severe
problem.
i
think
there's
a
consensus
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
that
that
was
an
intolerable
situation,
and
that
was
designed
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
constitution.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
i
think
it
is
not
enough,
because
if
congress
had
to
intercede
every
time
there
was
a
problem
here,
as
the
briefs
suggest,
it's
just
not
capable
of
doing
that,
and
that
kind
of
institutional
concern
was
addressed
by
the
framers.
they
were
concerned
about
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
was
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
and,
indeed,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
articles
of
confederation,
you
find
that
the
articles
of
confederation
was
much
more
explicit
about
the
things
that
states
could
not
do
in
the
area
of
foreign
policy.
for
example,
the
articles
of
confederation
denied
the
states
the
power
to
send
ambassadors.
there's
no
such
prohibition
in
the
constitution
as
adopted.
there
are
other
examples,
the
power
to
deal
with
captures,
to
punish
piracies.
if
you
look,
if
you
compare
the
articles
of
confederation
with
the
constitution,
you
find
that
the
articles
were
much
more
explicit.
the
working
assumption,
we
suggest,
and
it's
reflected
in
the
federalist
papers
and
in
the
debates
in
the
constitution,
was
that
that
kind
of
specificity
was
not
necessary,
that
the
constitution
was
designed
to
give
the
foreign
policy
power
to
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
nation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
they
were.
there
were--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--my
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
is,
to
the
extent
that
those
states
and
municipalities
used
selective
purchasing
against
south
africa,
they
were
unconstitutional
and,
of
course,
this
court
never
ruled
on
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
don't
think
on
the
selective
purchasing.
now,
what
they
had
in
connection
with
south
africa
was
two
kinds
of
laws,
the
selective
purchasing
law,
such
as
the
one
we
have
before
the
court
today,
and
i've
just
said
that
our
view
is
that
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
they
also
had
divestiture
laws,
such
as
came
before
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
the
board
of
trustees
case.
what
the
solicitor
general
suggests
is
that
divestiture
laws,
that
is,
we're
not
going
to
invest
in
companies,
we're
going
to
sell
our
stocks
and
bonds,
could
present
a
different
question.
they
don't--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
purpose
plus
effect.
we
don't
agree.
now,
we
think
the
divestiture
laws
are
unconstitutional,
but
we
recognize
they're
quite
different.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
against
the
rebellious
states?
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
sure,
but
i...
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
briefs
of
the
petitioners
and
all
their
amicus
briefs
who
go
into
this
long
history
about
this
have
not
found
a
single
instance
between
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
the
next
150
years
in
which
states
asserted
the
right
to
exercise
a
concurrent
authority
in
the
area
of
foreign
policy--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
under
the
printz
case--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
can't
speak
to
what
issues
were
raised
in
that
case
and
weren't
raised
in
that
case.
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
practice
of
refusing
to
honor
debts
to
british
citizens
was
a
central
concern
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution.
they
did
not
want
the
states
to
be
able
to
go
their
own
way
on
that
issue,
on
the
issue
of
sanctions,
those
were
the
things
that
concerned--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--you
could...
justice
scalia,
a
treaty
depends
upon
the
agreement
of
the
united
states
and
a
foreign
power.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
that
if
there
were
no
treaty,
that
the
states
could
go
their
own
way,
and
i
believe
that
the
constitutional
history,
the
federalist
papers,
and
the
debates
in
the
constitution,
support
the
view
that
they
did
not
intend
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
curtiss-wright
and
in
other
cases,
the
president
has
an
important
role
to
play
in
foreign
affairs.
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
the
framers
intended
to
say
that
congress
had
to
step
in
and
eliminate
these
state
laws,
otherwise
the
president's
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
could--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--be
hampered
just
as
much
as
the
states
wanted--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--39,000
municipalities,
and
this
court...
and
we're
not
just
relying
on
the
zschernig
case,
as
important
as
that
is,
but
in
the
pink
case,
in
the
belmont
case,
in
the
sabbatino
case,
this
court
has
assumed
again
and
again
and
again
that
state
action
may
be
precluded
without
the
necessity
of
a
formal
congressional--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--oh,
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
different
case,
justice
stevens.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
if
they're
intending
to
communicate
a
message--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
would
be
forbidden,
but
justice
stevens,
it's
not
a
question
of
motive,
it's
a
question
of
objective.
it's
not
trying
to
get
into
the
minds
of
the
legislators.
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
these
things
only
work
if
you
communicate
disapproval.
that
is
the
objective
of
the
statute,
and
they
do
it
through
this
very
coercive
secondary--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
don't
think,
justice
souter,
that
there'll
always
be
a
policy
reason
behind
that.
i
think
that
states
and
municipalities
constantly
make
purchasing
decisions
based
on
price
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--if
they
announce
that
they
are
trying
to
change
the
policies
of
a
foreign
government,
to
condemn
the
policies
of
a
foreign
government,
and
they
take
action,
yes,
in
our
view
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
that
is
a
different
case.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
in
our
view
it
would,
but
we
would
say
that's
a
very
different
case.
this
is
not...
this
is
not
limited
to
goods
coming
from
burma.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it's
highly
doubtful
that
massachusetts
buys
anything
from
burma.
what
they're
trying
to
do--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--right.
we're
not
going
to
buy
computers
from
a
german
company
because
they
sell
pencils
to
burma.
that
is
highly
coercive,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do,
in
our
view,
with
the
notion
of
disassociation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
if
he
coupled
that
with
a
remedy,
with
a
coercive
sanction,
no,
he
could
not
do
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
if--
[laughter]
i
think
it's
highly
undesirable.
it
may
possibly,
under
some
circumstances,
cause
foreign
policy
problems
that
could
create
an
issue.
that
could
never
come
before
this
court,
and
our
view
is
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--a
mere
speech
by
the
governor?
i
don't
see
how
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
making
foreign
policy,
justice
souter.
if
you
say,
this
is
our
position
with
respect
to
burma,
we're
trying
to
change
the
burmese
policies,
and
here's
the
remedy
that
we're
imposing,
we're
doing
something
which
has
a
consequence.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
if
the...
well,
i
don't
know
dollar
figures
is
what...
i
would
accept
it,
that
it
has
consequences.
there's
something
behind
there.
if
you
take--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
let
me
use
a
homey
analogy,
if
i
could.
if
we
look
at
the
states
as
though
it
were
a
dog
that
is
barking,
what
the
constitution
intended
to
do
was
to
take
the
teeth
away
from
the
dog,
and
if
the
dog
continues
to
bark,
if
the
states
and
municipalities
continue
to
say
things
on
the
issue
of
foreign
policy,
there
is
not
the
same
danger
of
interfering
with
federal
policy
if
there
are
no
teeth
to
enforce
it.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
that
from
the
point...
that
it
is
highly
undesirable
to
do
that,
and
that
may
constitute
the
impermissible
making
of
foreign
policy.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
i
think
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
what
it
was
intending
to
do
was
to
strip
the
enforcement
mechanisms
from
the
states,
and
if
you
go
down
the
lists
in
article
i,
that's
what
it
did.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
that
my
answer
would
be
that
raises
a
very
significant--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--it
may
be
unconstitutional,
but
the
core
purpose
here
in
allocating
foreign
affairs
to
the
government
was
to
say...
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
to
say,
if
you're
going
to
speak
on
foreign
policy,
and
you're
going
to
try
to
enforce
that
foreign
policy,
that's
something
that's
forbidden
to
you.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
right.
under
the
commerce
clause
that
would
not
be
an
issue,
and
under
the
commerce
clause
the
primary
issue
is
whether
the
action
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
is
proprietary,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
can't
possibly
be
proprietary.
it
has
no
economic
benefit
to
massachusetts
and
its
citizens.
it's
admittedly
not
something
that
any
private
purchasers
of
goods
and
services--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--my--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
as
i
understand
the
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
you
look
to
purpose
and
effect,
but
in
these
market
participant
cases,
my
understanding
is
that
the
line
the
court
is
trying
to
draw
is
between
regulation
and
proprietary
action.
and
under
cases
like
gould,
which,
while
it's
not
a
commerce
clause
case,
is
highly
relevant,
if
you
find
that
this
looks
like
regulation
through
market
participation,
then
it's
invalid,
and
we
think
if
you
look
at
this
massachusetts
law,
it
doesn't
look
anything
like...
for
a
number
of
reasons
it
doesn't
look
anything
like
purchasing.
it
looks
very
much
like
regulation
accomplished
through
purchasing,
and
therefore
it's
invalid.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
the
difference
between
the
combined
reporting
in
the
california
case
was...
first
of
all
was
nondiscriminatory
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commerce
clause
and,
most
important,
it
had
no
foreign
policy
objective.
massachusetts
didn't
care
what
the
consequences
were.
the
question
was
whether,
even
though
massachusetts
didn't
care
what
the
consequences
were,
that
nonetheless
made
it
unconstitutional.
