well,
think
of
california,
with
30
million
people,
probably
a
major
textbook
buyer,
probably
buys
a
lot
from
massachusetts.
suppose
the
state
system
said,
we
won't
buy
any
textbooks
from
massachusetts
because
we
don't
like
their
environmental
policy
in
that
state.
we
don't
like
their
criminal
law
policy.
we
don't
like
this,
we
don't
like
that.
we
don't
like
their
labor
policy.
how
could
you
run
a
federal
government
if
states,
when
they're
huge
buyers,
could
refuse
to
buy
from
some
other
state
because
they
don't
like
the
state
law
in
something
and
want
it
changed.
i
mean,
is
that
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
mean,
the
federal...
in
other
words,
in
your
view,
california
could
say,
we
will
not
buy
any
textbooks
from
addison-wesley
for
the
reason
that
we
don't
like
massachusetts
policies
in
respect
to
the
environment,
or
we
don't
like
their
policy...
they
have
no
death
penalty.
we
think
they
should.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
your
answer's
yes.
your
answer
is
that
the
constitution
would
permit
that
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
word
you
used
previously
was,
you
didn't
want
to
be
associated
with
the
regime
that
seriously
interferes
with
human
rights,
which
is
a
worthwhile,
obviously
worthwhile
objective,
and
i
can
understand
that,
but
the
sg
says
in
its
brief...
you
use
the
word
disassociated,
all
right.
if
you're
right
that
you
have
that
right
to
disassociate
yourself,
why
would
we
extend
that
to
what
is
in
effect
here
a
secondary
boycott?
that
is,
market
participants
in
many
situations
cannot
engage
in
secondary
boycotts.
massachusetts
is
saying,
we
won't
do
business
with
a
swedish
firm
that
buys
$15
worth
of
whatever
from
the
burmese
government,
and
why
doesn't
the
secondary
boycott
just
go
too
far,
given
justice
ginsburg's
concerns,
in
respect
to
the
need
to
disassociate
yourself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
thought
perhaps...
i
thought
maybe
you
agree
on
this,
i'm
not
sure,
that
whatever
it
requires,
we
should
treat
the
foreign
commerce
clause
the
same
as
the
dormant
commerce
clause
vis-a-vis
states
and
if,
in
fact,
they
could
do
this
vis...
give
us
a...
you'd
have
a
regular
body
of
law,
we'd
know
how
to
apply
it,
and
what
the...
what
massachusetts
could
do
vis-a-vis
texas,
it
can
do
vis-a-vis
austria,
et
cetera,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case.
is
that
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
a
kind
of
nightmare,
where
all
the
right-to-work
states
pass
laws
stopping
procurement
in
the
unionized
states,
and
all
the
unionized
states
pass
laws
trying
to
stop
procurement
in
the
right-to-work
states,
and
that's...
that
kind
of,
sort
of
chaos
is
what's
worrying
me
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
