justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
barnico,
may
i
go
back
to
an
answer
that
you
gave
both
to
justice
ginsburg
and
to
the
chief
justice
a
moment
ago
in
which
you
emphasized
the
expressive
nature
of
the
boycott
activity
which
massachusetts
is
engaging
in.
why
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
proper
way
to
draw
the
line
is
to
allow
states
to
express
themselves,
to
express
their
views
solemnly
any
way
they
want
to,
so
long
as
they
do
not
go
beyond
the
point
of
verbalizing?
massachusetts
or
any
state
could
pass,
for
example,
on
this
theory,
resolutions
condemning
the
regime
in
burma
and,
indeed,
condemning
those
who
do
business
with
it,
but
it
would
be
left
to
the
united
states
to
go
beyond
the
expression
of
views
and
to
regulate
actual
relationships,
including
economic
relationships.
wouldn't
that
be
a
sensible
way
of
having
a
theory
behind
our
preemption
doctrine
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does
that,
but
that
is
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
that
it
is
not
at
least
inappropriate
for
that
result
to
occur.
on
my
proposal,
you
would
get
to
engage
in
expression.
you
would
clear
your
conscience,
and
any
fault
would
lie,
i
suppose,
at
the
door
of
the
national
government
that
was
either
permitting
or
at
least
refusing
to
block
this
kind
of
trade.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
i
understand
your
point.
it
leads
to
a
second
question,
and
it
anticipates
a
question
i
was
going
to
ask
your
friends
on
the
other
side,
but
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
accept
the
position
of
the
other
side
and
we
say
that
the
massachusetts
statute
is
preempted.
what
will
massachusetts
do
then?
will
it
start,
in
fact,
trading
with
companies
that
do
business
with
burma,
or,
conversely,
will
it
continue
to
follow
the
policy
that
it
has
now,
even
though
that
policy
is
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
enforceable
against
anyone
because
of
the
preemption?
i
guess
i'm
saying,
will
you
continue
to
find
ways
to
express
yourselves
and
your
conscience,
even
if
there
is
a
preemption
or
some
other
source
of
invalidity
in
the
statute
found
so
that
the
statute
is
not,
as
such,
enforceable?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
assuming
the
circumstances
in
the
foreign
country
remain
as
they
are
now.
assume
that
today
you
have
the
statute
on
the
books,
tomorrow
the
statute
is
preempted.
what
does
massachusetts
do
in
fact,
if
it
is
preempted?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
go
ahead
and
trade
with
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
that
would
bind
you,
in
other
words?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
in
effect,
in...
the
only
case
in
which
it
would
be
true
on
your
theory
that
the
state
could,
as
you
said
a
moment
ago,
decide
who
to
deal
with,
would
be
the
case
in
which
the
state
says,
we
are
simply
going
to
deal
with
domestic
companies.
we're
going
to
keep
the
money
within
the
state
borders.
because
the
moment
the
state
said,
well,
we'll
deal
with
people
outside
the
state,
but
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
california,
or
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
burma,
there
will
always
be
a
policy
reason
behind
that,
and
it
will
always,
as
i
understand
it,
be
forbidden
on
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
exactly,
but
i'm
assuming
that...
i
mean,
i
think
the
whole
assumption
of
the
case
is
that
there
is
a
departure
from
the
usual
purchasing
regime
of
generally
accepting
the
lowest
responsible
bid,
and
if
there's
going
to
be
a
departure
from
that
regime,
and
it's
going
to
be
for
any
reason
other
than
merely
favoring
domestic
producers,
i
presume
there's
always
going
to
be
a
noneconomic
policy
reason
for
it
and
it
will
always
be
unconstitutional,
in
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
condemn,
i...
would
it
be
condemnation
if
the
state
simply
said,
look,
we
realize
we're
not
running
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
united
states,
and
we
realize
that
we're
not
running
burma,
but
we
do
have
responsibility
for
keeping
our
own
hands
clean,
and
we
are
not
going
to
buy
any
goods
derived
from
burma.
would
that
be
a
condemnation
sufficient
to
violate
the
constitution,
in
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize...
i
realize--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
let's...
we
want
super
hands
clean
so
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
any...
anyone
who
does
deal
with
burma,
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
cannot
be
the
subject
of
legal
action,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
an
expressive
case,
as
i...
as
you
implied
a
moment
ago.
it's
a
case
about
dollars
and
cents.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
right,
but
you're
saying
it
only
becomes
foreign
policy
subject
to
cognizance
in
a
court
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
dollar
figure
attached
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
in
june
of
1996,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
passed
a
statute
restricting
state
agencies
from
purchasing
goods
and
services
from
companies
doing
business
with
burma.
in
september
of
1996,
congress
passed
a
law
that
imposed
immediate
federal
sanctions
on
burma,
authorized
the
president
to
impose
further
sanctions
or
to
suspend
or
terminate
any
federal
sanctions,
and
directed
him
to
work
with
our
allies
in
developing
a
comprehensive
strategy
to
bring
human
rights
and
democracy
to
burma.
the
national
foreign
trade
council
which
represents
companies
engaged
in
foreign
commerce,
challenge
the
state
law
on
behalf
of
its
members.
the
district
court
held
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional,
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
foreign
affairs
power.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
affirmed
on
three
independent
grounds;
it
found
the
state
law
unconstitutionally
interfered
with
the
foreign
affairs
power
of
the
national
government
that
it
violated
the
dormant
foreign
commerce
clause
and
that
it
was
preempted
by
the
congressional
burma
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
at
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
first
circuit.
the
state
law
is
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
that
is,
it
is
preempted
because
it
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
congress’s
full
objectives
under
the
federal
act.
first,
congress
clearly
intended
the
president
to
exercise
effective
discretion
over
economic
sanctions
against
burma.
it
provided
him
with
the
ability
to
impose
additional
conditional
sanctions
and
to
suspend
or
terminate
all
federal
sanctions
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
the
state
sanctions
undermine
the
president’s
authority
by
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
bargain
with
the
full
economic
power
of
the
united
states.
second,
congress
carefully
calibrated
the
scope
of
sanctions
against
burma.
the
state
law
penalizes
behavior
well
beyond
that
range;
it
targets
contracts
for
goods,
services
or
technology,
and
the
behavior
of
foreign
as
well
as
united
states
companies,
all
of
which
the
federal
act
exempts.
finally,
congress
intended
the
president
to
speak
for
the
united
states
among
the
world’s
nations
in
developing
a
comprehensive
multi-lateral
strategy
toward
burma.
the
state
act
interferes
with
that
authority;
it
undermines
the
president’s
capacity
for
diplomacy
by
reducing
his
bargaining
power
and
generating
formal
protests
in
the
international
trade
disputes
with
our
allies.
the
state
act
conflicts
with
federal
law
and
must
therefore
yield.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
