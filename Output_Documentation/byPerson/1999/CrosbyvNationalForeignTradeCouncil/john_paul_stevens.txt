may
i
ask
this
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
you
would
concede,
would
you
not,
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
prohibiting
this
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
president?
could
the
president,
by
executive
order,
preclude
this
type
of
an
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
his
foreign
affairs
authority
would
be
sufficient
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dyk...
oh,
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
what
if
it
was
just
the
opposite?
instead
of
trying
to
discourage
something,
they
want
to
encourage
the
change
in
policy
in
a
different
state.
could
they
offer
extra
purchases
from
that
community
in
order
to
encourage--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
what
if
the
motivation
was,
for
example,
disaster
in
a
particular
country?
could
they
try
to
promote
recovery
from
the
disaster
by
fostering
purchases
from
a
company
that
went
through
a
bad
famine
or
hurricane,
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
all
depends
on
trying
to
influence
their
policies?
that's
the
key
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
why
affirmative
action
by
the
president...
i
asked
your
opponent.
he
thinks
affirmative
action
by
the
president
wouldn't
be
enough,
but
perhaps
affirmative
action
by
the
president
would
be,
but
the
question
is,
with
or
without
either
congressional
action
or
presidential
action,
is
this
foreclosed,
and
i'm
curious
to
know,
if
it
all
turns
on
the
motive
to
impact
on
the
foreign
country,
would
it
also
prevent
the
state
from
making
its
own
direct
decisions?
it
just
would
refuse
to
buy
anything
itself
from
burma.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
different,
but
would
it
not
be
decided
the
same
way
under
your
analysis
of
motive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
they
say,
we're
not
going
to
buy
from
you
because
we
don't
like
your
policy
toward
certain
minorities,
or
something
of
that
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
answer
to
that,
it
seemed
to
me...
mr.
dyk
made
the
same
point...
couldn't
they
pass
a
general
statute
making
into
positive
law
the
very
position
you're
asserting
here
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you
state...
what
i'm
suggesting
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
the
constitutional
rule
that
you
advocate
today
could
be
enacted
by
congress
as
a
statute.
