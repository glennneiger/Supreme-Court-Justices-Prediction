justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
two
states
had
different
policies?
one
state
says,
we
will
buy
not
from
mainland
china
but
taiwan,
and
the
others
state
just
the
opposite.
absent
federal
legislation
on
the
point,
states
are
free
to
do
that,
and
to
have
differing
policies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
it's
realistic
to
expect
the
congress
to
exercise
this
ongoing
supervision
over
every
local
ordinance,
over
every
state
statute,
and
it
certainly
is
inconsistent
with
what
the
federalist
papers
explain
was
the
purpose
of
forming
the
union
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
surely
there's
a
difference
in
those
two
cases.
in
the
hypothetical
justice
scalia
proposes,
california
doesn't
propose
to
regulate
activity
and
policies
of
other
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
different
from
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
proceeding
on
the
assumption
in
the
last
10
minutes
or
so
of
the
argument
that
massachusetts
has
a
right
to
speak
on
foreign
affairs,
to
dissociate
itself
from
certain
actions.
is
there
any
opinion
from
this
court
which
says
a
state
has
the
same
first
amendment
rights
as
a
citizen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
have
50
states
passing
resolutions
denouncing
different
governments?
i
know
of
no
such
principle
that's
been
established.
maybe
we'll
establish
it
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure...
i
don't...
i
agree
one
case
is
justiciable,
the
other
isn't.
the
hypothetical
would
be,
you
are
the
legal
advisor
to
the
governor.
he
asks
you,
may
i,
in
my
official
capacity,
make
this
foreign
policy
announcement,
and
i
would
think
your
answer
would
be
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--don't
you
think
that
under
your
theory
of
this
case,
if
the
legislature
and
the
governor
together
come
to
you
as
their
counsel
and
say,
may
we
constitutionally,
not
because
we're
going
to
be
sued,
but
just
to
obey
our
constitutional
constraints
and
duties,
join
50
other,
or
49
other
legislatures
in
condemning
taiwan,
or
mainland
china,
or
something?
what
is
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
our
negative
commerce
clause
cases,
do
we
have
statements
to
the
effect
that
we
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
usually
the
purpose
to
just
prefer
your
own
goods.
is
there
anything
else?
