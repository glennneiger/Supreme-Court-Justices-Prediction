we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-474,
andrew
s.
natsios
v.
the
national
foreign
trade
council.
mr.
barnico.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
gould
case
somewhat
against
you
on
this
point,
or
the
wisconsin
department
of
labor?
it
said
that
wisconsin
is
not
going
to
buy
from
anyone
who
has
violated
an
nlrb
order
and
they
said,
we're
just
expending
our
own
money,
and
this
court
said,
you
may
be
spending
your
own
money
but
that's...
what
they
said
was,
tantamount
to
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnico,
you
mentioned
the
historical
approach
a
few
minutes
ago.
is
there
a
historical
basis
for...
say,
prior
to
the
1980's
for
states
taking
this
sort
of
position
with
respect
to
foreign
governments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
until
the
1980's?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
revolutionary
times,
do
you
mean
before
the
constitution
was
adopted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
terribly
satisfactory
basis
for
analyzing
the
thing
after
the
constitution
was
adopted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you're
right,
mr.
barnico,
why
were
there...
have
there
been
no
barnic...
no
boycotts--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--between
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
the
1980's?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
activities
of
stalin
in
russia
and
hitler
in
germany
and
mussolini
in
italy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you'd
be
here
on
a
contempt
citation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
barnico.
mr.
dyk,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
not
talking
just
about
states,
either.
i
take
it
you're
talking
about
the
possibility
of
cities
adopting
this
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dyk,
certainly
a
good
part
of
your
argument
is
based
on
the
commerce
clause,
and
no
one
could
suggest
that
the
resolution
hypothesized
by...
involves
commerce.
it's
just
speech.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dyk.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnico,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-474,
crosby
versus
national
foreign
trade
council
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
