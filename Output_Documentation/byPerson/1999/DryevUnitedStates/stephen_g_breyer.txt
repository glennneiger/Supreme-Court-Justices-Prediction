g.
breyer
can
he
stop?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
true
that
this
is
a
little
unusual
in
that
here
you
have
the
arkansas
statute,
which
says
for
all
purposes,
once
it's
disclaimed,
it
disappears.
it's
not
like
a
stock
option
in
that
sense,
which
i
guess
for
a
lot
of
purposes
of
state
law,
even
after
the
expiration
date,
state
law
might
have
had
some
bite.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
state
laws.
so
i
looked
up
the
bankruptcy
law
to
see
how
federal
law
treats
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
bankruptcy
provisions
this
would
not
count
as
an
interest
in
property
for
purposes
of
a
fraudulent
transfer.
i
can
check
it
again,
but
i
don't
know
if
you've
looked
into
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
turns
out
that
for
bankruptcy
purposes
this
isn't
treated
as
an
interest,
i
mean,
i...
why...
you
haven't
thought
about
it,
so
i...
you're
not...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
on
the
precedent,
i
couldn't
find
any.
that
is
to
say,
the
reason
is,
statutorily
this
doesn't
count
as
a
property
right
for
tax
purposes,
because
they
have
all
these
statutes,
you
know,
that
let
you
disclaim.
then
i
couldn't
find
something
other
than
that.
now,
tell
me,
what
is...
what
do
you...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
a
gift
tax,
you
have
an
estate
tax...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
going
to
tell
me
some
federal
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
every
specie
of
right
or
interest,
so
in
fact
you
would
say
this
reaches
even
a
similar
situation
under
a
will
where
the
testator
isn't
dead
yet?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
so...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do,
actually.
i
might...
i
have
one,
and
you're
probably
not
going
to
have
an
answer,
because
we
haven't
looked
it
up,
and
i
haven't,
either,
but
as
i
was
looking
at
the
bankruptcy
law,
the
reason
that
i
was
concerned
is
the
following.
imagine
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
had
done
just
what
he
did,
but
he
did
it
30
days
before
going
bankrupt.
what...
if
i'm
right
about
the
bankruptcy
law,
the
interpretation
would
mean,
if
we
got
yours,
is
that
his
creditors,
who
were
private,
couldn't
get
at
the
money,
and
the
reason
is,
it
would
not
be
a,
quote,
interest
in
property,
but
the
government,
as
taxpayer,
would
be
able
to
get
at
the
money,
and
the
reason
would
be
because
it
is,
quote,
a
right
to
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
seemed,
you
know,
a
little
odd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
doesn't
say
interest,
it
says
right.
it
says
you
have
a
right
to
property,
and
if
you
do
nothing,
and
you
get
the
property,
and
legally
you're
entitled
to
it,
how
don't
you
have
a
right
to
property?
it
didn't
say
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
just
distinguished
it
away,
because
i
said
it
uses
interest
and
not
right.
