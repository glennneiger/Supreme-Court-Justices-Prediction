mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court:
for
our
socratic
dialogue
i
am
armed
with
a
borrowed
gideon
and
the
fruit.
this
is...
these
aids
go
right
to
the
jugular
of
this
case,
and
the
genesis
of
the
case,
which
is
chapter
3
of
genesis.
what
we
have
here
is,
when
the
serpent
extended
the
fruit
to
the
offeree,
free
will
said
that
the
offeree
had
a
right
to
accept
or
reject
the
gift.
assuming
that
that
offeree
was
a
tax
delinquent,
the
government's
position
is
that
their
6321
federal
tax
lien
attached
at
the
moment
that
the
serpent
extended
the
fruit.
that
is
not...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
i'm...
that
is
where
the
case
starts,
is
with
the
idea
of
free
will,
that
people
have
a
right
to
accept
or
reject
a
gift.
the
government
don't
believe
that.
they
believe
that
when
you
have
the
right
to
make
that
decision
and
grab
the
fruit,
that
their
lien
attached
to
that
personal
right
of
decision
to
elect.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
law
of
this
court,
as
announced
by
this
court.
i
don't
believe...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
what
congress
said
was
that
for
their
tax
lien
to
attach,
the
taxpayer
must
have
property
or
rights
to
the
property.
when
mrs.
drye
died,
at
the
instant
of
her
death,
the
government's
position
is
that
mr.
drye
acquired
a
right
to
property,
or
property
in
her
estate.
that
is
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
it
is
not
the
law
that
this
court
has
pronounced.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
well,
he
has
9
months
within
which
to
make
that
personal...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
law
is
very
clear
that
the
estate
owned
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
absolutely
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
absolutely
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
he
would
acquire...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
acquire
that
right
if,
and
only
if,
he
accepted,
took
a
bite
of
the
apple.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
only
if
he
took
a
bite
of
the
apple.
nothing
vests
until
you
accept
the
gift,
the
offer
of
the
gift.
you...
there
has
to
be
an
act
of
an
acceptance.
at
that
point,
mr.
drye
would
acquire
an
interest
or
a
property
in
his
mother's
estate
sufficient
for
the
tax
lien
to
attach.
that
never
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
well,
very
simply,
judge
howard
in
the
eighth
circuit
got
it
backwards.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
they
will
when
this
court
instructs
them
what
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
fifth...
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
on...
i'm
on
all
fours
in
near
identical
facts...
found
just
the
opposite,
on
very
recent
opinions.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
i
don't
think,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
found
that
the
taxpayer
in
both
states
never
acquired
an
interest
sufficient
for
a
tax
lien
to
attach.
this
is
not
really
about
the
disclaimer
and
the
relation
back.
it's
whether
anything
ever
vested,
a
right
in
property,
or
property
itself,
that
under
federal
law
is
sufficient.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
well,
see,
my
client
was
the
administrator...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
had
he
disclaimed
prior
to
that...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
he
can
accept...
he
can
take
a
bite
of
the
apple
and
go
to
state
court
and
say,
enjoin
that
administrator
from
going
to
las
vegas.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
he's
bitten
the
apple,
and
he's...
the
tax
lien
has
attached.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
i
believe
that
by...
that
that
would
be
an
act
of
acceptance
by
going
to
court
and
saying
that
i
am
protecting
my
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
i
am
acknowledging...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
he
has
a
right
to
do
that
when
he
does
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
it's
inchoate.
it's
unvested.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
by
an
act
of
faith...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
an
act
of
free
will.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
this
court...
well,
congress
has
said
that
you
have
a
reasonable
period
of
time
within...
to
make
that
election.
the
state
of
arkansas
has
said
that
you
have
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
make
that
election.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
in
their
identical
qualified
disclaimer
for
gift
and
generation...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
it's
in
the
same
book.
i
would
say...
[laughter]
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
a
different
subchapter.
i'm
not
a
tax
expert,
but
i
can
tell
you
for
sure
that
the
model
probate
code
of
which
arkansas,
texas,
arizona,
north
dakota,
and
by
my
count
30
other
states
have
said
that
you
have
9
months
as
a
reasonable...
and
it
tracks
the
federal
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
if
you
are
a
tax
delinquent,
a
6321
federal
tax
lien
has
attached
to
your
rights
in
those
stock
options,
and...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
well,
because
you...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
no.
you
have...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
you
have
a
vested
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
because...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
assuming
the
options
are
not
underwater,
then
that
stock
option
is
property
or
rights
to
property
for
6321
because
it's
transferable
and
has
pecuniary
value.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
you
could
transfer
the
option
to
another.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
government
says
transferability,
and
i
really
don't
care
about...
but
it
has
pecuniary
value.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
i
believe
the
government
could
come
and
seize
that
option
and
step
in...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
and
step
into
your
shoes.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
because
nothing
had
ever
vested.
it
was
a
personal
right
of
decision
that
was
without
pecuniary
value.
it
was
nontransferable.
it's
not
recognized
at
law
or
in
equity
in
arkansas.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
government
can
step
into
your
shoes
and
exercise...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
can
the
government
step
in...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
because...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
because
the
right
of
election
is
not
property.
it
has
no
value.
my
client
can't
take
a
nickel
for
his
right
of
decision.
by
definition,
a
disclaimer
has
to
be
without
consideration,
otherwise
the
government
would
have
sued
us
under
the
federal
debt
collection
procedures
act
of
1990,
the
fraudulent
transfer.
in
fact,
that
is
what
judge
howard
has
called
me,
and
judge
brantley,
the
chancellor
and
probate
judge
who
adjudicated
the
disposition
of
this
interesting
question,
called
us
both
a...
fraudulent
transferors.
this
thing
is...
mr.
drye's
disclaimer,
his
personal
right
of
election,
it's
one
of
two
things.
it
was
either
a
lawful
act
or
a
fraudulent
transfer.
it's
either
a
transfer,
or
it's
not.
i
suggest
it...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
your
honor,
it's
been
the
common
law
of
england
and
this
country,
codified
by
statute
in
arkansas,
until
you
take
that
bite
of
the
apple,
you
do
not
have
a
vested
interest
in
her
estate.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
absolutely.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
that
is
correct,
and
one
of
the
beauties
of
our
federal
system
that
different
states
define
their
interest
a
little
bit
different.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
has
never
interpreted
our
probate
code
since
the
model
act
was
adopted
in
'84.
to
answer
your
question,
sure.
i
mean,
if
mr....
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
court
would
say
that
it
is
a
transferable
interest,
and
once
you
have
transferred
it,
you've
bitten
the
apple,
your
right
to...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
i'm
doing
my
best,
your
honor.
it's...
that
is
an
act
of
the
bite
of
the
apple,
and...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
decisions.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
you
can.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
because
it
begs
the
question.
the
interest
has
already
vested.
the
act
of
assignment
of
the...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
it
is
once
you
assign
it.
you
can
no
longer
disclaim.
it
would
be
a
bar
to
disclaimer.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
this
court...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
this
court
answered
that
question
very
clearly
in
the
national
bank
of
commerce
case,
which
i
believe
to
be
the
leading
case
on
the
question,
and
states
can't
define
what
is
or
is
not
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
they
cannot.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
you
look
at
the
interest
under
state
law,
and
then
under
national
bank
of
commerce
you
then
look
to
see
if
that
interest
is
property
or
rights
to
property,
and
the
definition
primarily
is,
does
it
have
pecuniary
value.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
precisely,
because
of
your
delaware
example.
you
can't
let
states
define
what
has
incumbered
the
tax
man.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
my
best
answer
is,
you
look
in
depth
at
state
law
to
ascertain
what
is
the
nature
of
the
interest
or
right
under
state
law,
and
if
you'll
do
that
in
this
example,
you
will
find
that
mr.
drye
never
acquired
an
interest
sufficient
to
be
defined
under
federal
law
as
property,
or
rights
to
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
we
had
an
appointment
with
her
on
the
day
of
her
death
to
execute
a
will.
that
really
affected...
i
mean,
that's
why
my
name
is
in
the
caption.
i
mean,
that
was
what
was
to
happen,
and
it's
just
one
of
those
things
in
life
that,
in
fact,
mr.
drye
did
not
want
to
go
talk
to
his
mamma
and
tell
her...
mr.
drye
was
70,
his
mamma
was
almost
92,
i
believe,
at
the
time.
he
didn't
want
to
go
tell
his
mother,
sign
this
piece
of
paper
so
that
we
don't
have
to
be
up
here
today.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
that
has
been
the
common
law
of
england
and
this
country
for...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
hundreds
of
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
absolutely.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
said
it
wasn't.
the
only
circuit
that
has
said
it
is
is
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
were
both...
were
both
bequests.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
absolutely,
and
that
was
the
purpose
that
the
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws
got
together
and
said,
look,
there
isn't
any
reason...
for
the
last
500
years
we
have
let
people
have
the
freedom
to
decline
gifts
in...
bequests,
not
make
a
person
an
owner
against
their
consent,
but
if
it's
an
inheritance
you
will
take,
whether
you
will
or
not.
that
was
the
law
in
england
and
the
united
states
for
a
long
time.
the
commissioner
got
together
and
said,
look,
there
isn't
any
reason
for
that,
particularly
as
you
look
at
the
federal
tax
consequences.
one
is
a
transfer,
one
is
not.
they
got
together
back
in
the
mid-sixties,
they
removed
the
common
law
anomaly
of...
feudalism
is
where
that
distinction
arose
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
ago,
and
the
state
of
arkansas
has
adopted
it,
texas,
arizona,
north
dakota,
and
by
my
count
30
other
jurisdictions.
they
have
removed
the
distinction
between
the
two
of
them.
this
case
is...
the
fifth
circuit
decision
is
right
on
point,
and
it's
the
best
analysis
that
i
have
seen
of
it,
and
the
recent
ninth
circuit
decision.
both
of
them
to
me
are
very
thoughtful
decisions,
and
i
understand
that
this
is
not
a
very
palatable
result
that
has
resulted.
mr.
drye
didn't
pay
his
taxes.
the
government
needs
the
taxes,
and
through
this
sleight
of
hand...
but
these
people
across
the
street
over...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
well,
the
people
across
the
street
in
congress
can
very
easily
change
it.
in
their
wisdom,
they
have
chosen
not
to
make
a
disclaimer
a
fraudulent
conveyance.
in
fact,
in
the
state
of
arkansas
mr.
drye
would
not
have
had
this
ability
to
have
disclaimed
up
until
about
the
mid-eighties,
because
at
that
time
the
law
was
an
insolvent
beneficiary
could
not
disclaim.
that
bar
was
removed,
oh,
in
the
mid
eighties.
chief
justice,
if
i
might,
if
there's
no
other
present
questions,
could
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
government
has
taken
all
of
my
cases.
they're...
mitchell,
down
in
louisiana,
those
delinquent
taxpayers,
they
had
a
present
right,
and
then
they
tried
to
disclaim
it,
and
the
court
said,
look,
an
act
of
god
cannot
remove
a
federal
tax
lien
once
it's
attached,
and
i
agree
with
that.
the
question...
the
problem
here
is,
it
never
attached.
irvine,
the
court
recently
has
stated
that
the...
this
idea
of
acceptance
or
rejection
of
estates
can
be
based
on
a
gift
theory.
that
is
what
we're
talking...
we're
not
talking
about
a
mechanism
to
defeat
creditors.
we're
talking
about
transfer
and
succession
of
estates.
best,
that's
my
case.
the
delinquent
taxpayer
at
any
time
could
go
get
the
cash
value
of
his
life
insurance
policies.
the
fact
that
he
later
executed
a
disclaimer,
you
can't...
a
state
disclaimer
can't
extinguish
a
federal
tax
lien
once
it
attached.
the
only
people
who
can
do
that
are
the
people
across
the
street.
two
interesting
things,
the
government
says
that,
in
his
opening
statement
that...
i...
that
this
idea
of
the
bite
of
the
apple,
look
at
page
22
of
their
brief.
it
says
in
the
second
full
paragraph,
an
offer
which
can
be
accepted
or
rejected
is
itself
an
interest
in
property.
here's
an
offer
you
can
accept
or
reject.
the
government
lien
has
attached.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
ain't
the
law
of
the
country.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
the
act
of
doing
nothing
is
an
affirmative
act
that
cooks
your
goose.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
exactly.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
over
the
passage
of
time,
and
i
would
like
to...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
you
have
a
right
to
accept
or
reject,
but
more
importantly,
i
would
like
to
go
to
your
bankruptcy
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
on
the...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
on
the
bankruptcy
question,
whether
a
trustee
has
a
right
to
avoid
a
disclaimer
made
within,
oh,
i
guess
it
would
be
4
months,
the
government
ought
to
read
note
17
of
its
own
brief,
where
they
represent
that
the
trustee
does
have
such
a
right.
i
submit
to
you
that
they
do
not
read
that
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code
properly.
the
only
thing
that
generally
the
bankruptcy
trustee
can
avoid
are
transfers.
disclaimers,
by
definition,
cannot
be
a
transfer,
because
you
cannot
accept
any
consideration
for
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
congress
had
to
do
it,
because
it
treated
people
differently.
if
you
received
under
a
will,
you
were
not
taxed.
if
you
received
it
by
an
inheritance,
you
will
take
it
whether
you
will
or
not.
you
can
transfer
it
the
next
day,
but
you're
going
to
be
taxed.
and
people
raised
cain
and
said,
what's
the
difference?
congress
said
there
is
no
difference,
so
we're
going
to
treat
both
of
you
the
same.
and
then
the
state
law
commissioners
got
on
the
same
bandwagon
and...
mr.
daniel
m.
traylor
thank
you,
your
honor.
