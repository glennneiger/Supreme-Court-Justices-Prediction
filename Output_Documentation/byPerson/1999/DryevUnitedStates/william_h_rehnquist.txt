chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-1101,
rohn
f.
drye
v.
united
states.
mr.
traylor.
you're
the
only
lawyer
to
come
by
himself
we've
seen
in
a
long
time.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
i
understood
it,
mr.
traylor,
at
least
the
eighth
circuit
felt
that
way,
that
under
arkansas
law
your
client
acquired
a
property
interest
upon
death,
because
he
didn't
remit
it
for
a
number
of
months
afterwards.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
arkansas
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
traylor,
the
district
judge
who,
i'm
sure,
must
have
been
an
arkansas
practicing
lawyer
before
he
was
appointed
to
the
bench,
found
against
you
on
this
point,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
which
certainly
knows
more
about
arkansas
law
than
we
do,
found
against
you,
saying
that
there
was
a
property
interest
under
arkansas
law,
so
you
have
kind
of
a
heavy
burden
to
persuade
us
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
don't
realize
it,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose...
has
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
ever
held
that
the
sort
of
expectancy
that
your
client
had
before
he
disclaimed
was
transferable,
or
saleable,
or
that
it
was
not
transferable
or
saleable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i'm
asking
you
a
specific
question
about
the
holdings
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
has
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
ever
held
that
the
sort
of
interest
your
client
had
before
he
disclaimed
was
or
was
not
transferable
or
saleable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
mean
before
you
disclaimed.
during
the
period
before
you
disclaimed,
has
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
ever
said
whether
or
not
that
interest
was
transferable
or
saleable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not...
don't
tell
me
about
the
bite
of
the
apple
any
more.
just
tell
me
what
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
done,
or
if
it
hasn't
done
anything...
i
mean,
this
seems
the
key
to
your
whole
case,
and
if
there's
a
case
out
there
that
is...
shows
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
district
court
were
wrong,
you
should
surely
have
it.
what
is
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
you
say
states
can't
define
what
is
or
is
not
property
for
purposes
of
federal
tax
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
our
cases
held
just
the
opposite,
that
the
statute
says
if
you
have
property
the
government
can
get
it,
but
whether
or
not
you
have
property
is
up
to
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
you
have
some
state
court
cases
on
the
subject
that
don't
speak
directly
to
the
issue
in
question.
what
is
the
test?
what
do
you
look
for
in
state
law
to
see
whether
the
person
has
a
legally
protected
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
transferability
is
sufficient,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
devisee
has
no
action
against
the
testator
to...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
testator
revokes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
little
bit
more
intricate,
more
intricate
than
one
needs,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
interest
under
texas
law?
was
it
texas
the
fifth
circuit
was
deciding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
traylor,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
traylor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1101,
drye
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
