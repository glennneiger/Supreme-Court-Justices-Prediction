well,
of
course,
the
irs
was
not
in
paradise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
it
can.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
rutherford
case
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
which
as
i
understand
it
says
that
one
can
agree
to
convey
an
expectancy
in
an
estate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
why
doesn't
that
indicate
that
a
transfer
of
an
expectancy
is
transferable,
it's
property,
it
has
value?
that's
what
i
get
from
the
rutherford
case,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
case
we
ought
to
talk
about.
now,
maybe
you
have
ways
to
distinguish
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
an
expectancy
is
not
vested.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
legal
error
of
the
fifth
circuit
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
look
to
state
law
to
find
the
nature
of
the
interest,
and
you
look
to
the
federal
law
to
see
if
it's
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me,
a
right
of
rescission
or
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
can
you...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
the...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
go
ahead
and
defend
it.
