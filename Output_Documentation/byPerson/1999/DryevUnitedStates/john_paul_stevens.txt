yes,
but
may
i
suggest
the
difference
in
your
hypothetical.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
offeree
said
to
the
offeror,
i'm
not
sure
what
i
want
to
do.
i'll
let
you
know
in
30
days.
during
that
30
days,
the
offeror
could
have
taken
the
apple
back.
but
in
arkansas
the
court
would
not
have
allowed
the
offeror
to
take
it
back
for
30
days,
because
he
has
a
9-month
period
in
which
to
make
a
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it's
irrelevant
for
our
purposes
that
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law
the
decision
to
disclaim
relates
back
to
the
date
of
death,
and
that
therefore
the...
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law
he
never
had
any
property.
that's
irrelevant,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
think
it's
necessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
that's
not
necessary
to
your
position,
as
i
understand
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
different,
though,
would
it
not,
if
state
law
provided
that
a
beneficiary,
an
intestate...
an
heir
has
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
in
court
identifying
himself
or
herself
and
saying
affirmatively,
i
want
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
have
no
right
to
the
money
unless
he
filed
that
piece
of
paper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
had
to
take
an
affirmative
step
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
though,
the
nature
of
the
interest...
the
nature
of
the
interest
is,
he
has
nothing,
unless
he
files
that
piece
of
paper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
the
commerce
case
was
a
bank
account.
i
mean,
he
clearly
owned
the
money.
it's
just
a
question
of
how
much,
between
the
joint
account,
isn't
that
right,
because
he
had...
you
relied
there
on
the
fact
he
had
a
right
to
withdraw
the
money.
