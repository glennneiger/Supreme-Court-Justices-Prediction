justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
didn't
do
it
on
the
grounds
that
you
had
no
property
interest.
they
did
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
disclaimer
relates
back,
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
the
administrator
had
announced
that
he
was
going
to
liquidate
the
estate
and
take
the
money
and
go
to
las
vegas
and
have
a
good
time,
would
you
have
had
the
right
to
do
anything
about
that,
your
client
have
the
right
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
he
have
sat
back
and
said,
too
bad,
i
have
no
property
interest,
or
rights
to
property,
so
i
guess
the
administrator
can
look
forward
to
a
good
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
my
question.
he
hadn't
taken
any
action
one
way
or
the
other.
the
administrator
is
on
the
way
to
las
vegas.
can
he
do
anything
about
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
would
say,
when
he
got
to
court,
would
he
not,
i
have
a
right
to
inherit
that
property
if
i
want
to,
and
therefore
he
can't
go
to
las
vegas
with
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
you
are
representing
him,
and
he
says,
i'm
not
biting
the
apple,
i
am
simply
asserting
a
right
to
bite
the
apple,
haven't
bitten
yet.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
had
a
right
to
do
that,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
has
a
right
to
go
into
court
and
do
that,
doesn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
before?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
creates
it
himself?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
creates
the
right
himself?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
law
of
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
