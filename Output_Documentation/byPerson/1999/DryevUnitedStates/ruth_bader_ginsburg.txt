mr.
traylor,
the
government
is
not
relying
on
the
good
book,
but
it
is
relying
on
title
26
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
there
the
matter
of
disclaimer
is
dealt
with
in
the
estate
and
gift
tax
context,
but
it
isn't...
the
permission
for
a
disclaimer
appears
expressly
in
the
estate
and
gift
tax.
there
is
no
such
provision
for
the
tax
lien
act,
so
the
government
is
saying,
congress
did
not
choose
to
provide
for
disclaimer
in
that
context,
so
there
is
none.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
congress
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
they
say,
for
purposes
of
this
subchapter,
being
the
estate
and
gift
tax,
so
it's
clear
that
they
didn't
say
it
with
respect
to
tax
liens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
in
the
same
subchapter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
this
very
basic
thing.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
have
a
right
to
receive
the
entire
estate,
a
right
to
receive
it
if
i
want
it,
then
i
have
something
of
large
value,
and
it's
up
to
me
whether
i
want
to
realize
on
it.
but
to
say
that
it's
valueless
until
he
takes
a
bite
of
it,
i
mean,
he's...
he
can
realize
on
it
if
he
wants
to.
he's
solely
in
control.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's,
you
say
is
the
arkansas
law.
there
are
states,
are
there
not,
where
a
person
in
the
position
of
mr.
drye
would
be
deemed
to
have
had
the
property
and
then
given
it
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then...
so
if
we
took
your
view
of
it,
it
would
depend
which
state
you
come
from
whether
the
tax
lien
would
attach.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
traylor,
i'm
just
curious
about
why
the
taxpayer,
mr.
drye
being
in
this
situation,
he
didn't
have
his
mother
write
a
will
leaving
the
estate
to
the
daughter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
traylor,
do
i
take
it
from
what
you've
just
said,
cannot
be
a
transfer,
that
the
estate
gift
tax
provision
for
disclaimer,
that
was
unnecessary,
that
the
provision
for
it,
for
purposes
of
that
subchapter,
congress
didn't
need
to
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
respective
provinces
of
state
and
federal
law
in
determining
what
is
property
for
purposes
of
federal
tax
lien
legislation.
the
tax
payer,
mr.
drye
was
insolvent,
and
owed
the
federal
government
some
$325,000.00
on
unpaid
tax
assessments
for
which
notices
of
federal
tax
liens
had
been
filed.
his
mother
died
intestate
leaving
an
estate
worth
approximately
$233,000.00
to
which
drye
was
sole
heir.
some
six
months
after
his
mother’s
death,
drye
disclaimed
his
entire
interest
in
his
mother’s
estate.
by
operation
of
arkansas
law,
the
estate
then
passed
to
drye’s
daughter
who
set
up
a
spendthrift
trust
under
which
she
and
her
parents
were
beneficiaries.
in
a
contest
between
drye
and
the
internal
revenue
service,
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
for
the
government.
those
courts
concluded
that
despite
the
disclaimer,
drye’s
interest
in
his
mother’s
estate
qualified
as
a
right
to
property,
to
which
the
government’s
tax
lien
attached.
we
agree
that
drye’s
disclaimer
did
not
defeat
the
federal
tax
liens,
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
internal
revenue
code's
prescriptions
are
most
sensibly
read
to
look
to
state
law
for
delineation
of
the
tax
payer’s
rights
or
interests,
but
to
leave
to
federal
law
the
determination
whether
those
rights
or
interests
rank
as
property
or
rights
to
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
tax
lien
legislation.
congress
used
the
term
‘property’
broadly
in
that
legislation,
it
aimed
to
reach
every
legally
protected
right
and
property
that
one
can
keep
or
exchange
for
value.
drye’s
right
as
sole
heir
fit
that
description.
relying
on
decisions
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
under
state
law,
drye
had,
at
his
mother’s
death,
a
legally
protected
right
to
receive
the
property
at
issue,
a
right
he
could
transfer
to
others
for
money’s
worth.
drye
takes
a
different
view;
he
maintains
that
on
the
date
of
his
mother’s
death,
he
held
nothing
more
than
a
personal
non-transferable
right
to
accept
or
reject
a
gift.
but
arkansas
law
primarily
gave
drye
a
right
of
considerable
value;
the
unqualified
right
either
to
inherit
or
to
channel
the
inheritance
to
a
close
family
member,
the
next
lineal
descendent.
thus,
a
disclaiming
heir
inevitably
exercises
dominion
over
the
property,
unlike
a
donee,
who
by
declining
a
gift
restores
his
status
quo
ante,
leaving
the
donor
what
to
do
with
the
gift
what
she
will.
drye’s
power
to
channel
the
estate’s
assets
to
himself
or
to
his
daughter,
the
control
rein
he
held
under
state
law
warrants
the
conclusion
that
under
federal
law
he
had
a
right
to
property,
subject
to
the
government’s
tax
liens.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
