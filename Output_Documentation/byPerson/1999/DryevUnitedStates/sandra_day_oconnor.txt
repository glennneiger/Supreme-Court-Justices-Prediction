yes,
well,
who
owned
the
real
estate
during
the
9
months
before
the
decision
was
made?
who
owned
it,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think,
in
the
case
of
real
property,
that
the
title
went
to
the
beneficiary...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
arkansas
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
did
mr.
drye
have
a
right
to
transfer
whatever
right
he
had
to
his
mother's
estate
before
he
acquired
it...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
there's
any
way,
under
arkansas
law,
that
before
all
of
this
happened,
even
before
his
mother
died,
could
he
transfer
whatever
right
he
had
to
someone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
indeed,
this
was
real
property,
i
take
it...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
the
title
went
to
mr.
drye
immediately,
subject
to
this
state
law
right
to
disclaim
later,
but
i
thought
he
held
the
title
immediately.
is
that
right,
or
wrong?
