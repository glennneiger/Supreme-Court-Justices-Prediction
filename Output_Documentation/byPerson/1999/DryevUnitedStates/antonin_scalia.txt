mr.
traylor,
what
about
stock
options?
are
they
taxable
as
property?
i
mean,
i
have
an
option
to
buy
stock
in
a
company
that
i've
worked
for
for
a
number
of
years.
i
don't
have
to
exercise
the
option.
i
can
just
let
it
lapse.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
so.
now,
how
does
that...
but
how
does
that
square
with
your
case?
i
have
free
will.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
to
bite
the
apple.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
let
the
stock
option
just
lapse.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
have
a
vested
interest.
i
have
an
ability...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
assert
an
interest
by
agreeing
to
exercise
the
option,
but
i
don't
have
to
agree
to
exercise
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
transferable?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
this
is
a
nonassignable
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
pecuniary
value
only...
so
does
your
client's,
only
if
exercised.
i
have
a
nontransferable
option
to
buy
this
stock.
the
employee
can
only
exercise
it
personally.
he
can't
assign
it
to
anybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
understand
why
it
can't
come
and
seize
your
client's
interest
in
the
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
differ
from
the
stock...
does
my
stock
option
have
any
pecuniary
value,
if
i
cannot
assign
it
to
anybody?
i
couldn't
sell
it
to
anyone.
i
can't
get
a
bank
loan
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
property.
so
why
can't
the
government
step
into
your
client's
shoes...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
exercise
it
because
it's
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
after
you
accept
the
devise,
and
while
the
estate
is
still
in
administration,
what
you
have
might
be
called
an
expectancy.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
that
interested
in
what
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
to
say.
to
come
back
to
my
stock
option
example,
suppose
the
state
of
delaware,
in
order
to
make
itself
even
more
attractive
to
corporations,
passes
a
law
that
says,
henceforward
stock
options
in
the
stock
of
delaware
corporations
are
not
property...
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
federal
government
still
be
able
to
tax
those
stock
options?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
purposes
of
the
federal
tax
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
law
defines
your
rights,
but
whether
that
bundle
of
rights,
whatever
it
is,
rises
to
the
level
of
being
property
under
the
internal
revenue
code
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
had
done
that,
what
if
you...
if
it's
not
an
intestate
disposition,
but
there
is
a
will,
and
you
are
one
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
will,
all
right,
and
what
if
you
say,
i
don't
want
this
property.
you
simply
decline
the
bequest.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
are
you...
is
that
considered...
your
interest
in
that
bequest
considered
property
for
purposes
of
the
federal
tax
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
talking...
yes.
i'm
not
talking
about
intestate
disposition.
i'm
talking
about
a
bequest,
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
two
should
be
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
doesn't
really
need
the
tax.
they
had
a
surplus,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
you
don't
have
a
stick
that
you're
going
to
turn
into
a
snake
or
anything
like
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
treat
testate
and
intestate
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
treat
testate
the
same,
then
what
about
the
government's
attaching
a
tax
lien
to
a
gift
that
i've
offered?
i
haven't
died
yet,
but
i've
offered
my
son
a
particular
gift.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
state
law
is
that,
like
an
offer,
the
offer
of
a
gift
remains
open
until
it's
accepted?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means,
all
he
has
to
say
is,
i
accept,
and
the
property...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
accept
the
gift?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
a
property
right,
but
does
he
have
a
property
right
in
the
assets
of
the
estate?
let's...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
make
you
a
contractual
offer
that
is
open
for
90
days,
and
under
most
states'
laws
nowadays,
if
i
say
it's
open
for
90
days,
you
can
count
on
that.
that
is
worth
something.
it's
a
beneficial
contract
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
irrevocable
offer
for
90
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
right
to
accept
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
now
what
would
you
slam
your
lien
on,
my...
the
property
that
i
have...
that's
the
subject
of
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
90
days
have
gone
by.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
90
days
have
now
gone
by,
the
guy
never
exercised
the...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
accepted.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
expired.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
had
a
power
to
accept
it.
he
just
didn't.
just
as
in
this
case
he
had
a
power
to
accept
it,
but
he
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
i'll
call
it
a
right
in
the
other
case,
too,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
both
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
transfer
it?
can
he
give
it
to
somebody
else
to
accept
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
the
same
in
the
contract
case.
i
could
say,
you
know,
if
i
accept
this
contract,
i
assign
to
you
my
rights
under
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
accept
it
for
me,
but
if
i
do
accept
it,
you'll
have
my
rights
under
it.
i
see
no
difference
in
the
two
cases,
and
i
don't...
in
other
words,
i
acknowledge
that
it's
property,
but
is
the
property
the
assets
of
the
estate,
or
is
it,
rather,
this
right
to
accept
it,
which
is
intangible,
and
which
i
don't
know
how
you
can...
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
too
fast
to
say
the
lien
attaches
to
the
property.
i
agree,
but
what
is
the
property?
it
is
not
the
assets
of
the
estate.
it
is
his
right
to
obtain
those
assets.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
mr.
jones,
can
i
pursue...
you
said
that
the
lien
attaches
to
his
right
to
get
the
property.
if
he
exercises
that
right,
it
attaches
to
the
property
which
is
the
product.
but
if
he
doesn't
exercise
the
option,
and
somebody
else
gets
the
property,
that...
i
don't
see
it
as
being
the
product
of
his
option
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's...
the
government's
changed
his
position
a
little
bit.
i...
and
says
that
if
the
offer
is
framed
in
such
a
way
that
the
property
is
yours
unless
you
affirmatively
reject,
you
have
property
on
which
the
lien...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
act
of
doing
nothing
is
an
affirmative
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
contemplate
that
for
a
minute.
