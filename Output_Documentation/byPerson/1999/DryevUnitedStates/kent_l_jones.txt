mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
knew
this
day
was
going
to
come.
i
just
was
hoping
it
wouldn't
be
today.
[laughter]
i
wanted
to
say
5
seconds'
worth
about
the
apple,
and
then
talk
about
the
law.
this
case
does
not
involve
an
offer
of
a
gift.
this
case...
an
offeree
doesn't
have
any
legal
rights
in
the
proposed
gift.
he
can't
enforce
the
offer.
this
case
involves
an
intestate
succession
to
which
petitioner
is
the
sole
heir,
had
lawfully
and
legally
enforceable
rights
in
arkansas.
with
that
background,
i'd
like
to
now
talk
about
what
the
legal
issue
is.
the
legal
issue
is,
what's
the
scope
of
the
federal
tax
lien?
section
6321
of
the
internal
revenue
code
creates
a
federal
lien
in
all
property
and
rights
to
property
of
any
delinquent
taxpayer,
and
in
a
long
series
of
cases,
beginning
with
the
glass
city
bank
case
in
1945,
the
court
has
plainly
set
out
the
way
that
we're
supposed
to
answer
these
questions.
first,
you
look
to
state
law
to
see
what
the
nature
of
the
interest
that
the
taxpayer
has
is,
and
then
secondly,
federal
law
governs
the
determination
of
whether
that
interest
is
property
or
rights
to
property
under
the
federal
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
almost
certainly
the
answer
would
be
the
same,
and
certainly
the
method
of
answering
the
question
is
the
same.
the
method
is,
did
the
taxpayer
have
a
valuable,
legally
protected
right
to
receive
the
property.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
your
son
would
have
no
legally
protected
right,
no
enforceable
right
to
make
you
transfer
that
property
to
him.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
make
that
point
at
the
beginning.
this
case
does
not
involve
that
situation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
sure
what
that
would
mean,
but
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
you're
saying
that...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
he
has
a
legally
enforceable
right
under
state
law
to
accept.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
a
valuable
interest,
a
valuable,
legally
protected
right
that
this
court
has
explained
in
many
cases.
it
falls
within
the
federal
concept
of
what's
property
for
purposes
of
the
tax
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
one
clear
example
is
the
situation
we
have
here,
where
it's
the
sort
of
interest
that
can
be
transferred,
that
the
state
will
allow
you
to
transfer
the
interest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
certainly
be
sufficient
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
legally
protected
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
i
think
there
are
lots
of
legally
protected
rights
that
involve
property
interests
that
you
can't
transfer,
like
a
spendthrift
trust.
indeed,
that's
where
this
money
ended
up
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
prepared
to
address
that
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i...
even
without
thinking
about
it
in
much
depth
at
all,
i
mean,
what
we're
dealing
with
is
not
only
section
6321
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
a
fairly
large
body
of
precedent
of
this
court
under
that
statute,
and...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
even
sure
what
you're
referring
to,
these
statutes
that
let
you
dis...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
only
for
those
purposes.
the
internal...
what...
and,
of
course,
that's
an
entirely
different
subject.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
reason
that
the
disclaimers
are
allowed
if
they're
made
within
this
window
under...
for
purposes
of
the
gift
and
estate
tax,
is
to
avoid
imposing
a
double
tax
on
what's
essentially
a
single
flow-through.
but
the
reason
that
the
federal
tax
lien
reaches
this
property
is
because
the
taxpayer
had
that
legally
enforceable
right
to
decide
what
he
wanted
to
do
with
it,
which
was
a
valuable
right,
and
the
fairness
interest
that
i
think
congress
is
concerned
about
under
the
tax
lien
act
is
the
fairness
of
requiring
taxpayers
b,
c,
d,
and
e,
to
pay
more
than
their
fair
share
to
make
up
for
the
fact
that
taxpayer
a
hasn't
paid
his
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
well,
to
me
the
case
that
really
tells
us
how
to
decide
this
question
is
the
national
bank
of
commerce
case,
where
the
court
said
that
in
view
of
the
comprehensive
nature
of
the
statutory
language
that
congress
employed,
that
this
lien
reaches
every
valuable
right,
every
species
of
right
or
interest
that
a
taxpayer
might
invest
in...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i...
the
testator
can
revoke
his
will.
we're
talking...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
what
we're
talking
about
is
something
that
is
a
right
that
the
taxpayer
has,
and
under
arkansas
law,
for
example,
the
taxpayer
could
assign
his
expectancy
in
such
an
estate,
and
so
i
suppose
we
could
take
the
position,
which
we
don't
need
to
reach
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
of
course
not.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right,
so
i
mean,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
figure
out
what
would
be
the
value
that
the
lien
would
attach
to.
but
what
i
want
to...
the
point
i
keep
heading
toward
is
that
in
national
bank
of
commerce
what
the
court
said
was
that
nothing
more
than
common
sense
is
required
to
conclude
that
a
right
to
receive
property
is
itself
a
interest
in
property
that
the
lien
attaches
to,
and
that
is
precisely
the
nature
of
the
interest
that
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
has.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
fifth
circuit
in
leggett
was
wrong
exactly
for
the
reasons
i've
just
described.
in
leggett,
the
court
said
that
the
federal
lien
doesn't
attach
to
this
right
to
receive
property
because
under
state
law
that
is
just
a
personal
privilege,
and
it's
not
a
property
interest
for
purposes
of
state
law.
and
that's
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
two
fundamental
holdings
of
the
court
in
national
bank
of
commerce,
the
first
of
which
is
that
federal
law,
not
state
law,
governs
in
deciding
what's
property
under
the
tax
lien
and,
secondly,
that
the
right
to
receive
property
is
property
under
the
tax
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
national
bank
of
commerce.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
these
intricacies
rarely
arise,
but
when
they
arise,
that's
how
they're
to
be
resolved.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
it
was...
i...
it
was
interest
under
a
will,
but
the
principles
of
property
that
govern
the
disposition
of
that
interest
are
the
same,
whether
it's
intestate
or
testate
and,
indeed,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
state
court...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
the
fifth
circuit
in
leggett
seems
to
us
to
have
erred
in
its
description
of
how
state
law
operates,
to
say
all
they
had
was
a
right
of
decision.
they
had
a
lot
more
than
a
right
to
decision.
as
the
eighth
circuit
pointed
out
in
this
case,
under
the
similar
provisions
of
arkansas...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
decision
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
called
it.
under
the
state
law
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
receive
the
property
without
doing
anything.
they
don't
have
to
make
a
decision,
any
more
than
i
have
to
make
a
decision
to
withdraw
money
out
of
my
bank
account.
it's
still
my
property.
if
i
withdraw
it...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
a
right
to
receive
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it's
an
irrevocable
offer
for
90
days.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
then
you
have
a
right
to
accept
it.
it's
a
valuable
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
subject
to
federal
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
i
would...
the
lien
would
be...
i
would
have
the...
i
would...
it
depends
at
what
stage
we're
at.
if
i...
if
i
try
to...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
i
try
to...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
the
offer
wasn't
accepted?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
has
it
expired?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well
then,
there's
nothing
left
for
us
to
attach
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
he
doesn't
have
a
power
to
accept
it.
he
has
the
right
to
accept
it.
it's
not
a
power,
it's
a
right.
he
can...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
can
transfer...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
really
is
a
fundamentally
different
concept.
he
can
transfer
this
right
away.
he
can,
quote,
disclaim
it,
which
the
court
said
in
the...
in
the
irvine
case
was
an
indirect
transfer
of
it.
he
can
get
rid
of
it.
but
as
this
court's
held
in
best,
and
phelps...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
who?
we're
talking
about
this
taxpayer?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
he
could
transfer
his
right
to
receive
the
property
by
an
assignment
under
state
law.
indeed,
you
don't
have
to
look
further
than
the
state's
disclaimer
provisions
to
see
that
an
assignment...
that
this
interest
can
be
assigned,
because
once
you've
assigned
it,
you
can
then
no
longer
disclaim
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
the
federal...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
easiest
way
to
answer
it
is
by
reference
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
phelps
case.
the
federal
lien
attaches
to
the
property
and
to...
however
it
is
transferred,
and
to
anything
substituted
for
it,
and
because
of
that,
the
lien
exists
at
all
phases
of
this...
i'm
sorry,
at
all
phases
of
this...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
factual
pattern.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
his
right
to
receive
them
initially.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
then
when
he
transfers
that
right
the
lien
follows
that
along
to
whoever
obtained
that
right.
in
this
case,
it
was
his
daughter,
and
then
it
attached
to
the
assets
themselves
when
she
received
them,
and
then
it
continued
to
attach
to
the
assets
as
they
were
transferred
to
the
trust,
and
because
it
continued
to
exist
in
these
properties,
the
properties
were
lawfully
seized
for
collection
of
taxes.
that's
the
fact
pattern.
there
was
one
other
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
i
do
need
to
discuss,
the
mapes
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
reached
a
similarly
incorrect
as
leggett,
but
did
it
by
a
different
route.
what
the
court
held
in
the
mapes
case
was
that
the
federal
lien
doesn't
attach
to
the
taxpayer's
right
to
receive
the
estate,
because
once
the
taxpayer
renounces
the
interest,
it's
said
to
be
renounced
for
all
purposes
under
state
law,
and
the
court
said,
therefore
the
taxpayer
should
be
treated
as
if
he
never
owned
an
interest
in
the
property.
the
clear
error
in
that
decision
is,
the
court
didn't
cite
any
of
this
court's
decisions
and,
in
particular,
didn't
cite
the
mitchell
case,
where
this
court
held
that
a
retroactive
renunciation
of
a
property
interest...
and
i'm
quoting...
should
not
be
misinterpreted
as
an
indication
that
the
taxpayer
never
owned
an
interest
in
the
property.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
you
look
to
the
realizable
economic
value
of
the
taxpayer's
rights,
and
you
don't
look
to
the
state
law
fictions
of
retroactive
renunciations
and
disclaimers.
as
the
court
held
in
the
irvine
case,
federal
tax
law
is
not
struck
blind
by
the
state's
legal
fiction
of
a
retroactive
disclaimer.
the
lien
attached
to
the
rights
at
the
time
that
it
arose,
and
subsequent
dispositions
of
that,
of
the
interest
could
not
destroy
the
federal
lien.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
possible.
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
say
yea
or
nay,
but
i
can
say
it's
a
very
common
situation
that
the
federal
tax
lien
applies
in
a
situation
where
private
creditors
have
no
opportunity
to...
i
mean,
that's
what
the
best
case
was
precisely
about.
and
the
courts
held
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
under
other
law,
state
law
in
that
case,
whether
you
have
a...
whether
other
creditors
could
seize
it.
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law
under
section
6321,
and
under
the
federal
law,
if
the
federal
law
provides
a
lien,
that's
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't...
what
do
you
mean
by
doesn't
exercise
the
option
that...
this
taxpayer
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
to
get
the
property.
it's
his
automatically.
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier.
he
can
transfer
his
right,
but
if
he
doesn't
do
anything,
if
he
doesn't
write
a
disclaimer,
he
doesn't
make
an
assignment,
that
property
comes
to
him.
why?
because
he
already
has
a
vested
right
to
receive
that
property
under
state
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
some
of
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
described
it,
and
that's
my
understanding
of
arkansas
law
as
well.
the
court
of
appeals,
i...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
would
only
be
different
if
the
right
were
not...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
they
had
the
right
to
the
money,
if
they
had
a
legally
protected
right
to...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
goes
back
to
the
colloquy
i
had
with
justice
scalia.
if
he
has
a
legally
protected
right
that
is
vested
in
him
to
receive
this
money...
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you...
that's
an
interesting
point.
i
really
haven't
thought
about
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
he
had
to
take
a
specific
act,
and
he
doesn't
take
the
act,
that
would
be
a
harder
problem,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
we
come
out.
this
case
is
not
like
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
want
to
point
out,
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
made
that
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
had
a
right
to
receive
the
money,
which
is...
i'm
using
the
words
of
the
court
in
the
national
bank
of
commerce
case,
and
they
pointed
out
that
it
didn't
matter
whether
that
was
a
right
that
the
state
law
would
call
a
property
right.
it
didn't
matter
that
he
couldn't
get
the
money
until
some
day
in
the
future.
what
mattered
was
that
at
the
time
the
lien
attached,
he
had
a
vested
right
to
get
that
money
at
some
point.
