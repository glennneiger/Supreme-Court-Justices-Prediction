justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
that
they
want
to
delay
these
proceedings?
that's
just
a
factual
issue
that
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
clear
on.
he's
behind
bars
whether
he's
in
new
york
or
whether
he's
in
ohio.
i
mean,
is
it
just
that
it's
more
fun
to
be
getting
ready
for
trial?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
he
want
to
stay...
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
suggesting
as
a
kind
of
a
systemic
way
that
most...
or
a
lot
of
defendants
are
going
to
want
to
stay
in...
in
the
requesting
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it's
just
the
delay.
they're
not
enjoying
themselves.
they
just
want
to
string
it
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in
mezzanatto,
the
statute
in
fact...
i
forget
whether
it
was
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
now...
articulated
that
public
interest.
and...
and
that's
what
we
don't
have
in...
in
this
case,
and
this
is...
that's
another
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
federal
speedy
trial
statute.
