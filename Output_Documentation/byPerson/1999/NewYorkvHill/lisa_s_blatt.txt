ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
waived
his
speedy
trial
right
under
article
iii
of
the
iad
when
his
counsel
consented
to
a
trial
date
falling
beyond
the
statutory
period.
this
court
has
held
that
statutory
rights
are
presumptively
subject
to
waiver
as
a
clear
indication
that
the
legislature
intended
to
depart
from
that
presumption.
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
or
history
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
that
indicates
that
either
congress
or
the
adopting
states
intended
to
preclude
prisoners
from
waiving
their
rights
under
the
agreement.
indeed,
only
the
prisoner
may
invoke
the
speedy
trial
right
under
article
iii
by
requesting
disposition
of
an
outstanding
detainer.
the
history
of
the
agreement,
moreover,
makes
clear
that
the
speedy
trial
right
is
primarily
designed
to
benefit
the
prisoner
by
protecting
him
from
the
ill
effects
of
detainers.
a
prisoner
may,
therefore,
waive
the
protections
of
the
iad
by
taking...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
he
was
present
at
the
hearing,
but
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
defendant
personally
need
not
give
personal
consent
with
respect
to
strategic
and
trial
type
decisions.
the
adversarial
system
basically
couldn't
function
if
every
time
counsel
made
a
decision,
the
trial
judge
had
to
say
to
the
defendant...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
this
court
has
indicated
that
instances
in
which
the
defendant
must
give
personal
informed
consent
is...
is,
by
and
large,
limited
to
fundamental
constitutional
trial
type
rights.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
correct.
the
decision
is
up...
the
prisoner
initiates
the
transfer
by
filing
the
request,
but
generally
speaking,
and
certainly
something
like
a
trial
date,
the
decisions
by
counsel
are
usually
binding
on
the
client.
and
there's
no
reason
to
depart
from
that
here.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
the...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
counsel
could
fill
out
the
form.
i
don't...
i
mean,
i
guess
there's
no
reason
to
think...
i
don't
know
whether
the
defendant
personally
has
to
sign
it
or
not.
i
don't...
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
counsel
couldn't...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
i...
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
key
point
about
article
iii...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no,
it
would
be.
my
key
point...
and
let
me
be
clear
on
this...
is
that
the
sending
state
cannot
force
the...
the
transfer.
it's
up
to
the...
the
prisoner,
and
he
can
do
that
through
counsel.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right,
he
could.
and
the...
when
you're
in
the
sending
state
and
the
trial
is
going
and
the...
and
the
court
sets
a
date
and
trial
counsel
says
that
would
be
fine,
that
that's
reasonably
viewed
by
the
trial
court
as...
as
an
express
consent.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
if...
if
the
court
solicited
the
party's
input
and
there
was
no
response,
that
that
might
be
a
waiver.
but
generally
pure
silence
would
be,
at
least
in
the
federal
system,
a
procedural
default
under...
the...
the
prisoner
would
not
be
able
to
get
relief
unless
he
met
the
plain
error
standard
for
procedural
default.
but
if
there's
express
consent,
then
that...
that
is
a
waiver
and...
and...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that
is
generally
in
the...
in
the
federal
system,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
relief.
it
would
be
procedural
default
unless
plain
error
was
met.
the
only
category
where
it
might
fall
into
waiver
is
if
the
trial
court
expressly
solicited
the
input
of
counsel
and
said,
how's
this
date
with
you,
and
counsel
just
didn't
respond,
maybe
that
kind
of
situation.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
this
case
is
express
consent
and...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it's
waiver
in
this
case.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
absolutely.
again,
but
that
is
a...
i'm
not
sure
the
court
would
be
able
to
resolve
that
because
that
would
be
a
question
of
states...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right,
and
that
wouldn't
be
a
question
for
this
court.
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
new
york
courts.
but
it
is
a
federal
question
about
waiver
and
the
scope
of
the
waiver,
and
it's
clear
that
express
consent
is
a
waiver.
and
this
court
made
that
clear
in
peretz
v.
united
states
and
in
other
cases.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
my
understanding
is
no.
the
only...
the
only
control
the
sending...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
state
has
is
under
article
iv.
if
new
york
had
filed
the
request
for
temporary
custody,
then
the
governor
would
have
30
days
to...
to
veto
that.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
there
is
a
general
interest...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right,
but
that
interest
doesn't
suggest
that
the
right
is
not
waivable
or
still
can't
be
waived.
there...
by
joining
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
states
have
consented
to
some
delay
inherent
when
the
prisoner
is
transferred
out
of
the
jurisdiction
to
be
tried
on...
on
outstanding
charges.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
the...
well,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
you.
if
the...
if
the...
well,
if
the
defendant
requests
transfer,
there's
nothing
the
sending
state
can
do
about
that,
and
there's
going
to
be
some
delay
necessary
to...
to
try
him,
and
then
the...
the...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
they
could
work
that
out.
yes.
but
the...
the...
when
the
defendant
is...
is
taken
to
new
york
and
tried
there,
new
york
does
have
an
obligation
to
return
him
to
the
sending
state
when
that
is
done.
and
then
ohio
could
try
him.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
if
the
state
had...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
because
it's
a
federal
question
and
i
don't
think
states
can
amend
federal
law.
and
so,
it
has
to
be
subject
to
uniform
interpretation,
but
if...
and
so...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
on
the
scope
of
the
waiver,
states
are...
only
could
have
procedural
rules,
but
i
think
the...
the
question
of
waiver
is
one
of
federal
law
in
which
there
has
to
be
a
single,
uniform
interpretation.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
in...
in
this
case
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
purported
to
interpret
federal
law
and...
and
saying
that
federal
law...
you
couldn't
waive
it
by
consent.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
well,
as...
as
a
practical
matter,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
either
the
trial
court
or
the
prosecutor
are
going
to
just
let
the
defendant
say
i
don't...
i
don't
care
when
i'm
tried...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
there
are
state
speedy
trial
acts.
in
the
federal
system,
there
would
be
the
federal
speedy
trial
act,
and
the
defendant
would
have
to
be...
would
have
to
be
tried
in
accordance
with
those
terms
and
then...
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
this
agreement
has
been
around
since
1957
and
i've
never
heard
of
states
complaining
about
this
problem.
but
generally
the...
you
know,
our
position
is
that
even
if
there's
some
public
purpose
to
be
served,
that
doesn't
suggest
that
the
right
is
not
waivable.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
but
our
position
is
not
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
waiver.
the...
the
trial
court
always
has
discretion
to...
to
not
grant
a
continuance
if
there's
no
cause.
but
the...
so,
there's
no
reason
to
think
the
trial
court
would...
would
do
that.
and
there's
certainly
nothing
to
stop
ohio
from
calling
up
new
york,
saying,
you
know,
can
you
speed
this
up.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
the
court
can
reject
the
waiver.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
can
i
answer
the
question?
it's
more
in
the
nature
of
a
privilege.
the...
the
trial
court
is
not
bound
to
accept
the
waiver.
