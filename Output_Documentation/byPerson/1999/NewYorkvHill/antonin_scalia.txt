justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
term
continuance
is...
is
used
when
a
date
has
already
been
set
and
you
want
to
extend
the
date.
it
would
seem
to
me
strange
to
talk
about
setting
an
initial
date
as
being
a
continuance
for
good
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
normal
english.
you
continue
a
date
that...
from
a
date
that's
already
been
set.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
you
didn't
argue
it.
right?
because
it
wouldn't
have
made
much
sense
to
argue
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mastrocola,
what
if
i
think
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
180-day
period
is...
is
to
protect
the
sending
state,
the
state
in
which
the
prisoner
was
incarcerated?
new
york
requests
the
prisoner
to...
to
try
him
and
he's
sent
to
new
york.
and
then
new
york
counsel
and
the
prisoner's
counsel
diddle...
diddle
along
with
this...
with
this
case,
extend
the
180
period
indefinitely.
and
i'm
the
sending
state
and
i
say,
you
know,
i
want
this
prisoner
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
have
a
flat
180-day
rule
so
that...
so
that
i
know
when
i
send
this
prisoner,
i'll
have
him
back
in
my
state
so
i
can
try
him
as
soon
as
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
he's
in
a
cushy
prison
while
he's...
while
he's
waiting
trial
in
the
other
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he's
in
prison
on...
on
one
conviction
and...
and
is...
is
also
accused
on
another
charge
in
the...
in
the
sending
state?
does
the
sending
state
have
no
obligation
to
send
him
off?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
already
incarcerated,
but
there's
another...
there's
another
criminal
complaint
filed
against
him
which
has
not
yet
been...
which
has
not
yet
been
tried
in
that
same
state.
and
then
another
state
requests
his
extradition
for...
for
trial
on
yet
a
third
criminal
charge.
he
doesn't
have
to
be
sent?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
want
to
try
him...
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
it
can't
be
done
by
counsel?
counsel
could
not...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
very
crucial
to...
to
the
whole
line
of
questions
that
justice
stevens
was...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
would
be
ineffective
if...
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
made
a
request
through
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
he
could
do
it
through
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
didn't
say
that
would
be
fine?
are
you
taking
the
position...
i
mean,
what...
what
if
the
date
was
set
and
the
defendant
says
nothing
about
it?
wouldn't
that
be...
reasonably
be
considered
his
waiver
of
his
right
to
have
it
within
180
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
if...
if
a
date
is
set
and
the
defendant
does
not
object
to
that
date,
what?
has
he
waived
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
does
it
have
to
be
waiver
rather
than
procedural
default
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
i'm...
i'm
wondering...
you
know,
we
have
to
write
the
opinion
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
waiver
the
only
way
to
get
around
it?
can
there
be
a
procedural
default
of
your
right
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
stevens...
i
have
to
attribute
it.
the
reality
of
the
matter
is
that
the
sending
state
is
probably
delighted
to
have
the
receiving
state
feed
and
house
the
prisoner
for
as
long
as
it
wants.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
he
held,
as
you
said...
is
he
held
in
jail
instead
of
in...
in
a
penitentiary
while
he's...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
your...
if
you
do,
indeed,
and
we
should,
indeed,
have
a
concern
for
the
sending
state,
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't...
wouldn't
extend
to
continuances
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
as
well
or
to,
you
know,
extensions
at
the
request
of
the
defendant.
why
should
that
make
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
are
the
two
states,
just...
just
out
of
curiosity.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
a
multi-state
compact
called
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
permits
a
state
agency
which
intends
to
file
criminal
charges
against
an
individual
serving
a
sentence
in
another
state
to
lodge
what
is
called
a
detainer
against
the
prisoner.
this
is
simply
a
request
to
the
institution
in
which
the
prisoner
is
housed,
hold
the
prisoner
for
the
out
of
state
agency
or
notify
that
agency
when
the
prisoner’s
release
is
eminent.
the
iad
provides
that
if
a
prisoner
against
whom
a
detainer
has
been
lodged
files
a
so
called
request
for
final
disposition,
he
must
be
brought
to
trial
on
the
charges
giving
rise
to
the
detainer
within
180
days
and
if
that
time
limit
is
not
observed,
the
charges
must
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
here
the
petitioner,
new
york
state,
lodged
a
detainer
against
respondent
hill,
an
ohio
prisoner.
hill
filed
a
request
for
final
disposition
and
was
returned
to
new
york
to
face
robbery
and
murder
charges.
when
prosecution
and
defense
counsel
met
with
the
court
to
set
a
trial
date,
hill’s
attorney
agreed
to
a
date
outside
the
180-day
period.
after
the
180-day
period
had
expired,
hill
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
although
the
trial
court
and
the
new
york
appellate
division
concluded
that
counsel’s
agreement
to
the
later
date
waived
the
iad’s
time
limits,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
found
no
waiver
and
accordingly
reversed
the
respondent’s
convictions
and
ordered
the
charges
dismissed
with
prejudice.
we
reverse.
although
the
iad
does
not
expressly
discuss
waiver
of
the
rights
that
it
confers
the
availability
of
waiver
is
generally
presumed,
absent
affirmative
indication
to
the
contrary,
which
is
not
present
here.
we
conclude
that
defense
counsel’s
agreement
to
the
trial
date
is
adequate
to
affect
waiver
without
the
necessity
of
obtaining
the
personal
agreement
of
the
defendant
himself.
only
defense
counsel
can
determine
whether
the
defense
would
be
ready
to
proceed
earlier
than
the
date
suggested
and
requiring
the
defendant’s
personal
assent
for
routine
scheduling
matter
such
as
this
would
consume
time
to
know
apparent
purpose.
respondent
argues
that
because
prompt
resolution
of
detainers
benefits
not
only
the
defendant
but
society
generally,
waiver
cannot
be
allowed,
but
we
have
never
suggested
that
any
personal
right
which
also
benefits
society
is
unwaivable,
and
such
a
suggestion
would
contradict
some
of
our
cases.
in
validating
the
waiver
because
of
society
suppose
interest
in
prompt
resolution
would
be
particularly
inappropriate
here
given
that
the
iad’s
time
limits
do
not
even
apply
unless
the
prisoner
or
the
detaining
state
files
a
request
for
final
disposition.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
that
there
was
no
waiver
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
defense
did
not
“affirmatively
request”
an
untimely
trial
date.
but
nothing
in
the
iad
suggests
a
distinction
between
waiver
proposed
and
waiver
agreed
to.
in
light
of
its
potential
for
abuse
and
given
the
harsh
remedy
of
dismissal
with
prejudice,
we
decline
to
adopt
such
a
distinction
and
find
a
valid
waiver
here.
the
court’s
opinion
is
unanimous.
