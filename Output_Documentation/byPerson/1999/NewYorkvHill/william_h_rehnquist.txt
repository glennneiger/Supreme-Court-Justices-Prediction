chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
98-1299,
new
york
v.
michael
hill.
mr.
mastrocola.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you
say...
you
say
expressly
agree.
the
defendant's
counsel
expressly
agreed.
do
you...
do
you
say
that
is
the
same
thing
as
the
defendant
agreeing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
the
question
you
brought
here,
mr.
mastrocola,
though
you
might
not
have
realized
it
from
all
the
questions,
is,
does
the
defendant's
express
agreement
to
a
trial
date
beyond
the
180-day
period
required
by
the
iad
constitute
a
waiver
of
his
right
to
trial
within
the
period?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
they
directed
the
dismissal
of
a
murder
indictment,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mastrocola.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
treated
it
as
a
federal
question,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
cited
a
bunch
of
other
federal
cases
involving
iad's
to
decide
whether
this
had
been
waived
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you're
scheduled
for
a
trial
in
the
supreme
court
of
monroe
county,
i
don't
think
the
defendant
could
get
away
with
simply
saying,
you
know,
i
don't
want...
i
want
to
be
tried
6
months
from
now.
eventually
the
court
is
going
to
say,
look,
we're
going
to
set
a
trial
date
whether
you
want
to
waive
anything
or
not.
this
is
going
to
be
the
trial
date.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
shiffrin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rely
on
the
interest
of
the
sending
state
in
its
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
they
did
so
in
some
other...
ordinarily
one
thinks
of
an
opinion
as
being
express.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
asked
you
rather
specifically
not
what
the
arguments
were,
but
whether
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
relied
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
that
makes
me
pause
about
your
argument,
mr.
shiffrin,
is
that
the
drastic
effect
of...
of
the
result
reached
by
the...
an
indictment
for
murder
against
this
person
was
simply
dismissed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't...
can't
you
answer
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
question
and
then
explain?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
that
may
be
new
york
practice.
you're
certainly
more
familiar
with
it
than
i
am.
it
certainly
wasn't
the
practice
in
arizona
to
talk
about
a...
i
agree
with
justice
o'connor
who,
of
course,
herself
practiced
in
arizona.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
refer
to
a
continuance
unless
you're
talking
about
a
change
of
a
trial
date
that
has
already
been
set.
but
this
has
to
have
national
application,
and
the
word
continuance
is
used.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shiffrin,
did
this...
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
indictment,
you
say,
in
19...
or
the
lower
courts
didn't
dismiss
the
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
so
the
prisoner
was
in
new
york
for...
for
several
years.
did
ohio
ever
request
his
return
during
this
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
he
had
been...
if
he
had
been...
if
he
were
tried
in
new
york
and
he
could
be
sent
back
after
that,
could
he
not?
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
ohio
was
asking
that
this
murder
indictment
be
dismissed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
180
days
to
go
to
trial
in
the
supreme
court.
then
supposing
that
he's
convicted
and
he
appeals,
he's
going
to
be
in
new
york
for
a
number
of
years.
it's
not...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
he...
he
is
appealing
his
case
in
new
york,
but
he...
he
has
to
go
back
to
ohio?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
interpretation
just
leaves
it
open
to
the
defendant
to
sandbag,
to
appear
to
give
consent
the
way
this
defendant
did.
in
fact,
the
attorney
explicitly...
and
then
to
come
in
later
and
say,
well,
look,
it's
too
late.
dismiss
my
murder
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
defendant
at
least
consented
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
waive
statutory
rights.
you've
agreed
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
doesn't
have
to
say
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
any
of
the
states
filed
amicus
briefs
here
supporting
your
position
because
they
might
be
in
the
position
of...
of
a
sending
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think...
you
think
i
consent
to
the
delay
is
different
from
that's
fine
with
me
when
you're...
when
the
judge
has
proposed
a
trial
date?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
these
sort
of
exchanges
take
place
all
the
time
in
courtrooms.
and,
you
know,
we
don't
get
out
a
webster's
unabridged
dictionary
every
time
to
figure
out
what
it
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
simply
goes
contrary
to
the
rule
that
statutory
rights
can
be
waived.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not
just
a
speedy
disposition,
but
a
disposition.
you
know,
to
say
that
if
you
don't
get
it
done
in
90
days,
you
dismiss
a
murder
indictment
is
pretty
strong
medicine.
certainly
new
york
has
an
interest
in
bringing
to
trial,
in
a
fair
trial
and
reasonable
time,
a
person
charged
with
murder,
and
getting
a
verdict
from
the
jury
either
guilty
or
not
guilty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
indication
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
wish
to
impose
on
itself
a
higher
standard.
the
cases
it
cited
are
all
federal
cases
from
other
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes.
if
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
said,
we
think
this
is
a
state
law
question,
not
a
federal
question,
and
we
are
therefore
going
to
say
that
it
can't...
it
is
not
waived
under
these
circumstances,
we
would
then
have
before
us
the
question
of
whether...
the
iad,
being
a
federal
statute,
as
we've
held
in
a
case...
new
york
can
do
that.
but
we
don't
have
that
question
here
because
new
york
didn't
try
to
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
had
that
opportunity
before
and
didn't
choose
to
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shiffrin.
mr.
mastrocola,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr....
thank
you,
mr.
mastrocola.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
in
98-1299,
new
york
against
hill
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
