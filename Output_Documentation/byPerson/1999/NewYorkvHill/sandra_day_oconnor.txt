justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
just
a
matter
of...
as
a
matter
of
convenience
for
everyone,
i
wonder
why
the
prosecutor
didn't
point
out
that
it
was
beyond
the
180
days.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
would
certainly
have
avoided
a
lot
of
problems.
wouldn't
you
think
prosecutors
ought
to
do
that
normally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
should.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
probably
not,
but
i
just
wonder
about
the
kind
of
practice
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
point
it
out
to
the
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shiffrin,
what...
what
if
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
both
went
in
the
courtroom
when
the
trial
date
was
being
set
and
expressly
said,
both
of
them,
to
the
court,
we
waive
any
right
to
be
tried
within
the
180
days?
it's
okay
if
we
go
to
trial
may
1.
let's...
let...
how
about
that?
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
trial
court
says
a
convenient
date
for
trial
is
may
1.
now
that
date
is
beyond
the
180
days.
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
say,
we
know
that's
beyond
the
180
days.
we
waive
that
and
may
1
is
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
a
continuance.
we're
setting
the
trial
date
for
the
first
time.
the
court
says
may
1.
that
is
beyond
the
180
days.
everybody
knows
that.
defendant
and
his
counsel
say
okay.
now,
is
that
going
to
be
sufficient
as
a
waiver?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there's
never
been
a
trial
date
set,
how
could
it
be
a
continuance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't
have
any
objection
by
ohio
in
this
case,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
there's
no
public
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
defendant
is
tried
of
these
very
serious
crimes
in
new
york?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
would
think
that
may
be
an
overriding
public
interest
here
where
you
can
find
circumstances
in
which
you
can
say
there
was
a
waiver
by
the
defense
counsel
of
the...
the
period
of
time.
i
would
think
the
public
interest
would
fall
on
the
side
of
allowing
new
york
to
conduct
those
proceedings.
