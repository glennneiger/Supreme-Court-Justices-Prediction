mr.
brian
shiffrin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
both
the
language
of
the
iad
and
the
public
interests
served
by
the
statute,
particularly
the
interests
of
the
sending
state,
unrepresented
in
the
courtroom
in
the
receiving
state,
require
that
in
iad
cases
continuances,
except
those
requested
by
or
instigated
by...
by
the
defense,
must
be
judged
by
the
statutory
good
cause
standard.
the
defense
response
to
a
suggestion
of
a
continuance
by
either
the
court
or
the
prosecution
is
a
factor
to
consider
in
determining
whether
the
good
cause
standard
was
met.
the
defense
response
could
be
an
objection.
it
could
be
silence.
it
could
be
a
concurrence,
a
statement
of
availability,
or
a
consent.
the...
if
i
can
address
the...
the
multitude
of
questions
with
respect
to
the
interest
of
the
sending
state,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
the
interest
of
the
sending
state
is...
is
greater
than
merely
the
situation
where
there's
also
pending
charges.
sending
states
have
an
interest
in
where
convicted
felons...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
they
did
not
expressly,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
i
believe
that
the
decision
setting
up
a
dichotomy
between
waiver
occurring
when
there's
a
request
by
defense
counsel
for
a
continuance
and
all
of
the
circumstances
subject
to
the
good
cause
test
is
a
reflection
of
the
public
policy
interest.
if
i
can...
if
i
can
explain...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
they
did
not
rely
on
that.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the
sending
state's
interest
in
having
their
prisoners
serve
sentences
in
maximum
security
prisons
in
their
state
rather
than
local
jails
elsewhere
is
best
evidenced
by
a
number
of
things.
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
article
iii(e),
requires
an
inmate
who's
invoking
the
statute
to
sign
a
document
agreeing
to
go
back
to
that
sending
state
as
soon
as
the
receiving
state
is
finished.
article
v(e)
requires
the
receiving
state
to
send
the
individual
back
to
the
sending
state
immediately.
in
this
case,
mr.
hill
was
sent
back
to
ohio
immediately.
indeed,
in
this...
this
court's
decision
in
mauro
points
out
the
principles
and
reasons
behind
the
enactment
of
the
iad
was
that
there
should
be
an
assurance
that
the
prisoner
who
stands
trial
in
one
state
is
going
to
be
returned
in
an
orderly
fashion.
there
would
have
been
a
need
for
an
iad
if
sending
states
didn't
care
and
were
simply
glad
to
get
rid
of...
of
the
guy.
one
of
the
concerns
sending
states
have...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
while
he's
awaiting
trial,
he's
in
the
local
jail,
which
is
a
different
set
of
circumstances.
additionally,
while
in
a
local
jail,
a
state
prisoner
from
ohio,
in
this
case
ohio,
is
not
able
to
take
advantage
of
various
programs
for
rehabilitation
which
affect
the
sending
state
because
if
that
individual
is
eligible
for
parole
and
gets
released
to
that
sending
state,
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
sending
state
to
have
that
person
better
suited
for
rehabilitation.
all
those
reasons
are...
are
reflected
in
a
statute
that
says,
fine,
we'll
give
you
our
guy,
but
you
have
to
send
him
back
to
us
quickly,
and
there
are
strict
time
requirements
to
be
strictly
enforced.
and
congress
went
a
step
further.
they
enacted
a
very
limited
tolling
provision,
a
tolling
provision
based
on
good
cause
as
opposed
to
the
tolling
provision
in
numerous
other
statutes
saying
time
periods
could
toll
on
either
a
good
cause
or
consent.
the
determination
to
not
include
the
or
consent
language
here
i
think
is
important
because
what's
being
argued
by
the
petitioner
is
that
consent
is
a
per
se
basis
for
giving
up
those
rights.
but
if
time
periods
are...
can,
in
fact,
be
per
se
lost
by
consent,
there
would
not
be
a
need
for
that
language
elsewhere.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
this
is
very
similar
to
speedy
trial
statutes
in
general,
whether
it's
the
federal
speedy
trial
act,
new
york's,
or
ohio's.
there's
been
a
legislative
determination
that
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
societal
interests
in
the
speedy
disposition
of
the
charges
is
to
make
sure
that
the
state
understands
the
very
drastic
remedy
that
will...
that
will
occur
if
there's
not
compliance...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
and
monitoring
of
the
time
requirements.
and
therefore...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the
answer
to
your
question
depends
upon
the
context
of
what
was
said
before
that,
and
let
me
explain
what
i
mean
by
that.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
it's
my
position...
and
what
was
different
i
believe
in
the
second
time
the
question
was
asked
is
we
found
out
what
was
said
beforehand,
which
is
the
court
has...
the
court
is
proposing
a
delay.
and
at
that
point,
that
continuance,
consented
to
expressly...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
first
of
all,
i
disagree
with
your
predicate.
i
believe
all
adjournments
of
court
proceedings
are
a
continuance
of
that
case.
the...
in
determining
whether
the
adjournment
and
continuance
is...
is
to
be
counted
against
the
180-day...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
there
might
not
have
been
a
trial
date
set.
there
had
been
prior
court
proceedings.
there...
the
court
proceedings
keep
on
getting
continued.
indeed,
the...
they
brought
back
this
case
on
january
9th,
1995
nearly
400
days
after
the
first
court
appearance
in
this
case,
after...
after
the...
the
time
period
began.
the...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
the
statute
sets
forth
a
very
strict
time
requirement
and
a
strict
enforcement
mechanism.
as
you
point
out,
by
the
way,
that
the
penalty
of
dismissal,
your
honor,
is
different
in
federal
court
than
it
is
in
state
courts
because
the
iad
has
a
different
provision
in
federal
courts
where
there's
not
dismissal
with
prejudice,
as
opposed
to
the
law
in
new
york
state.
but
going
back...
going
back
to
the
question,
the...
by...
by
only
allowing
extensions
of
that
very
strict
time
period,
when
there
are
continuances
on
good
cause
shown,
there's
a...
there's
a
statement
by
the
legislation...
by
the
legislature
that
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
balance
of
the
interests
of
the
defendant,
the
interests
of
the
receiving
state
and
the
sending
state,
is
to...
is
to
limit
the
circumstances
in
which...
in
which
those
time
periods
can
be
lost.
the
reason
we
distinguish
the
situation
where
there's
a
request
for
a...
for
a
delay
by
the
defendant
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
it's
simply
unfair
and
unjust
for
defendant
to
ask
for
something,
get
it,
and
then
be
able
to
complain
about
it.
but
more
importantly,
the
public
interest
of...
served
by
the
iad,
the
interest
of
the
sending
state,
would
be
lost
if
defendants
could
do
that
because
they
would
be
encouraged
to
delay
cases.
and
the...
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
unrepresented
interest
of
the
sending
state
as
a
limiting
factor
as
to
the
circumstances
in
which
waiver
applies.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
there's...
ohio
wasn't
a
party
in
the
courtroom.
that's...
that's
the
problem.
that's
why
we
need
to
have
a
limit
on...
on
waiver.
you
have
in
the
courtroom...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
if...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
there's
one...
one
provision
in
that
hypothetical
which...
which
i
call
your
attention
to
to
explain
my
answer.
in
your
hypothetical,
you
talked
about
this
being
for
the
convenience
of
defense
counsel.
if
this
was
a
request
by
defense
counsel,
it's
one
thing.
otherwise,
in
this
very
case,
in
july
of
1994,
that's
precisely
what
happened,
and
the
judge
ruled
ultimately
that
that
continuance,
the
july
'94
continuance,
with
consent
of
the
defendant,
was
on
good
cause.
in
this
case,
the
district
attorney's
response...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
yes.
the
prisoner
was
not
in...
well,
he
was
in
new
york
state
for
about
a
year
and
a
half.
as
soon
as
the
trial
was
over,
ohio
requested
him
to
be
returned
there,
and
he's
serving
his
sentence
in
ohio,
which
is
further
evidence
of
the
interest
of
ohio
and
other
sending
states.
they
want
their
prisoners
to
serve
sentences
in
their
prisons
and...
which
is
why...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
ohio
doesn't
have
to
ask
that
under
the
statute.
before
they...
before
they
gave
up
control
of
their
prisoner,
they
were
entitled
to
rely
on
the
statute
that
says
180
days,
we're
getting
him
back,
unless
there's
exceptions...
unless
there's
continuances
for
good
cause
shown
or
if
there's
waiver
by
means
of
defense
request.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the
way
the
statute
reads,
as
soon
as
the
trial
is
over,
he's
required
to
be
sent
back
to
the
sending
state.
he
doesn't
have
a
right...
he
does
not
have
a
right
under
the
statute
to
stay
in
new
york
during
that
appellate
process.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
that's
correct.
and
mr.
hill
is
in
ohio
and
has
been
in
ohio
for
a
number
of
years
now,
serving
his
ohio
sentence.
he's
not
serving
the
new
york
sentence.
the
new
york
sentence
was
vacated
last
year
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
during
the
period
between
conviction,
appeal
to
the
appellate
division
in
new
york,
and
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
he
was
not
in
new
york
serving
the
new
york
sentence.
he
was
in
ohio
because
ohio
is
entitled
to
exercise
their
right
to
have
custody
of
their
prisoner.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
yes,
and
there's
two
reasons
for
that.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
actually
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
i
believe
most
speedy...
most
speedy
trial
statutes
are
written
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
federal
speedy
trial
act,
which...
which
places
a
burden
of
compliance
on
the
state
and
makes...
limits
greatly
the
circumstances
in
which
the
defendant
can
cause
delay
in...
in
the
case.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
that
is
correct.
in
mezzanatto,
this
court
held
that
statutory
rights
are
presumptively
waivable.
however,
in
mezzanatto,
this
court
instructed
that
the
courts
must
examine
both
the
language
of
a
statute
and...
and
the
public
interests
and
policies
served
to
determine
how
waiver
applies
to
a
particular
statutory
right.
with
respect
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
setting
forth
very
strict
time
requirements,
very
limited
exceptions
as
to
when
those
time
requirements
could
be
expanded
and
phrased
without
the
or
consent
language
that
congress
has
used
in,
again,
almost
a
score
of
other
statutes,
that
the
language
suggests...
and
also
i
should
add,
the...
article
ix
says
this
statute
is
to
be
liberally
construed...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
a
few...
a
few
answers
are
needed
with
respect
to
that
question,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
in
this
particular
case,
when
nearly
400
days
had
passed
between
the
commencement
of
the
iad
period
and
the
january
9th
appearance,
no...
and
none
of
which
was...
was
clearly
already
determined
to
have
been
calculated
under
the
statute,
it's
impossible
to...
to
say
that
any
attorneys
were
purposely
seeking
delay
to
avoid
the
consequences.
indeed,
it
just
is
possible
on
this
record
where
we
know
that,
mr.
huether,
the
trial
da,
was
otherwise...
was
otherwise
occupied...
he
wanted
a
delay
and
was
hoping
that
without
mentioning
the
iad...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
but
the
reason
that
the
statutory
test
is
not
the
intent
of
the
defense
counsel
or
the
district
attorney,
but
rather
whether
good
cause
was
shown,
is
because
just
like
with
the
federal
speedy
trial
act
where
consent
in
the
federal
speedy
trial
act
does
not
result
in
waiver,
is
we
want
to
have...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
yes,
and...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
we're
not
disagreeing
at
all.
but
the
question
is
under
what
circumstances
can
a
particular
statutory
right
be
waived.
and
the
reason
we
argue
that...
that
with
respect
to
this
statute
and
these
statutory
rights,
the
line
for
waiver
should
be
with
continuances
at
the
request
of
the
defense
is...
is
again
because
to
allow
those
type
of
requests...
requests
of
continuances
to...
to
escape
review
would
be
to
encourage
delay
and
therefore
defeat
the
public
policy
interests.
but
all
other
types
of
requests
should...
should
be...
the
onus
should
be
put
on
the
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
good
cause
shown.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
the
reason
that...
that
i
believe
the
line
could
be
drawn
at
continuances
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
is
if
you
allow
continuances
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
to
actually
delay...
delay
proceedings,
you're...
you're
encouraging
defendants
to
delay
proceedings.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
first
of
all...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
we're
not
suggesting
that's
what
occurred
in
this
particular
case.
however,
in
some
cases...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the
advantage
of...
of
delay
in
trials
in
general...
and
it's
something
recognized
in
the
speedy
trial
statutes...
is
evidence
could
be
lost,
witnesses
could...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
i
believe
that's...
that's
one
of
the
primary
motivators
for
passing
the
speedy
trial
statutes
which
have
addressed
remedy
of
dismissal
to
ensure
the
state
keeps
track
of
the
time
and...
and
meets
their
burden
of
complying
with
the
statute.
but...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
not
disputing
that...
the
facts
that
you
posited
or
in
fact
what
occurred
in
this
case
could
have
been
considered
under
a
good
cause
analysis...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
i...
i
would...
i
would
respond
that
by
making
that
statement,
effectively
the
defendant
is
saying,
i
want
this
delay,
and
if
the
defendant
is
saying
that,
he
has
waived
his
right
to
complain.
that
is
not
what
occurred
here.
by
the
way,
in
context
what
occurred
here
is
the
district
attorney
was
asked
whether
he
was
available,
and...
and
the
answer
was
that
would
fit
his...
his
calendar.
and
in
that
context,
the
defense
attorney
was
asked
how
was
that
with
defense
counsel,
and
the
response
was,
that's
fine
with
me.
that's
a
statement
of
availability,
not
desirability.
i
don't
think
it's
critical
on
the
issue
of
waiver,
but
rather
whether
good
cause
was
found
because
depending
on
the
circumstances,
the
defense
response
is
a
factor
to
consider
and...
and
a
stronger
response,
for
instance,
the
response
that
occurred
in
this
case
a
year
earlier
or
6
months
earlier
in
july,
i
consent
to
the
delay,
clearly
is
a
strong
factor
in
finding
good
cause.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
one
of
the
problems
with
the
language,
that's...
that's
fine
with
me,
in
this
context
it
could
very
well
have
meant
i'm
free
too,
your
honor.
i'm
also
available.
there's...
there
is
ambiguity
as
to
what
was
what
was
intended.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there's
a
need
to.
to
the
contrary,
i'm
suggesting
there's
a
simple
rule.
if
the
defendant
has
not
requested
the...
the
delay,
there's
not
waiver.
rather,
let's
consider
whether
this
delay
meets
the
good
cause
test
before...
before
a
judge
grants
it.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
except
that
in
the
same
decision,
mezzanatto,
this
court
which,
you
know,
articulated
that,
the
court
went
through
a
very
lengthy
analysis
of
the
public
interests
served
by
that
rule
because
this
court
recognized
that,
depending
on
the
public
interests
that
are
served,
there...
there
could
be
limits
on...
on
the
presumption
of
waivability.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the
statute
itself,
in
the
iad,
has
a
provision,
article
ix,
saying
liberally
construe
this
statute
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
the
purposes
were...
for
the
iad
were
set
forth
in
a
number
of
documents
which
are...
are
incorporated
in
this
court's
decision
in
mauro.
and
one
of
those
purposes
is
to
ensure
that
prisoners
released
to
stand
trial
in...
in
another
jurisdiction
will
be
returned
to
that
jurisdiction
promptly.
the...
we
have
that
as
part
of...
of
the
history
in
this
statute.
the
decision
by
new
york...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
i
think
there's...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
i...
i
agree
that
receiving
states
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
speedy
disposition
of
their...
of
their
charges,
which
is
why
under
this
statute,
just
like
the
new
york
speedy
trial
statutes,
there's
a
strong
incentive
for
prosecutors
to
comply
with
speedy
trial...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
i
would
suggest
that
strong
interest
is
reflected
in
the
legislative
determination
in
new
york,
that
by
dismissing
an
occasional
case,
they
will
achieve
that
goal
in
more...
in
many
more
cases
of
speedy
disposition
of
cases.
and
that
again
is
consistent
with
the
speedy
trial
statutes
in
general.
some
cases
get
dismissed,
but
more
cases,
as
a
result,
are
tried
speedily
because
prosecutors
and
courts
are
going
to
be
wary
of
allowing
time
periods
to
go
unnoticed.
what
happened
here
was
new
york
state
dismissed
a
new
york
prosecution.
if
in
fact,
the
line
for...
for
what
constitutes
waiver
is
not
as
i'm
proposing
and
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held,
requested
delay,
but
even
if
the
line
is
something
else,
if
new
york
or
any
other
state
wishes
to
impose
upon
itself
a
higher
standard,
it
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
interest...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
my
point
in
this
regard
is
if...
if
a
state
wished...
in
fact,
wanted...
wanted
to
do
so,
that
would
be
proper
because
what's
required
for
uniformity
is
a
floor
as
to
what
circumstances
are
not...
are
not
permitted.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
however,
if...
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
different
standard
than
new
york's,
i
would
urge
that
the
case
at
least
be
remanded
to
allow
new
york
the
opportunity
to
determine
under
new
york's
version
of
the
iad,
they
want
to
impose
a
higher
obligation
upon
themselves...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
i...
i
would
suggest
that
their
decision...
setting
a
standard
of
request
reflects
a
determination
of
new
york
policy
that
their...
new
york's
interests,
as
well
as
the
interests
of
the
sending
state
and
mr.
hill,
are
served
best
by
having
strict
time
requirements
to
be
strictly...
strictly
applied.
mr.
brian
shiffrin
if...
mr.
brian
shiffrin
the...
if...
if
the
court
were
to...
were
to
reject
my...
my
contention
that
new
york
was
correct
with
respect
to
the
waiver
standard
being
at
request
not...
not
at
consent...
again,
i
should
point
out
in
this
case,
the
trial
da
did
not
argue
waiver.
the
trial
da
argued
this
was
good
cause.
and
this...
this
very
well
might
have
been
a
factor...
the
dialogue
that
occurred
on
january
9th
might
have
been
a
factor
in
a
good
cause
determination.
that
argument
has
been
abandoned.
what's
left
here
is
in
a
situation
where
the
petitioner
has
chosen
not
to
rely
on
the
statute,
is
seeking...
is
seeking
to
rely
on
waiver
analysis,
and
it's
our
position
that
waiver
analysis,
with
respect
to
the
iad,
exists
and
occur...
and...
and
must
exist
in
a
limited
fashion
in
order
to
ensure
that
not
only
the
interests
of
mr.
hill
and
other
defendants
are
met,
but
also
the
interests
of
the...
of
the
two
states.
the
interests
of
not
only...
i've
discussed
the
sending
state,
but
the
interests
of
the
receiving
state
are
not
always
adequately
represented
by
trial
prosecutors.
that's
reflected
in
speedy
trial
statutes
that
allow
for
dismissal,
even
when
there's
no
objection
by
defendants,
as
a
means
to
ensure
that
the
prosecutors
know
that
they
have
a
burden
of
compliance.
this
statute
puts
a
burden
of
compliance
on...
on
a
state.
the
only
burden
the
statute
puts
on
the
defendant,
in
this
case
mr.
hill,
was
to
invoke
the
statute,
which
he
did
in
writing,
the
document
in
writing,
actually
had
a
form
for...
for
the
defendant
to
sign.
there's
no
place
for...
for
counsel
to
sign.
he
invoked
that
statute
in
writing.
he...
at
that
point
as
the
statute
is
written,
puts
the
burden
of
compliance
solely
on
the
state.
the
state
apparently
neglected
its
burden
and
chooses
not
to
rely
on
statutory
language,
but
instead
is
hoping
that
the...
that
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
waiver
analysis
which
has
no
limits.
the
reason
i
say
that
it
has
no
limits,
it's
not
clear
from
the
petitioner
is
he's
saying
is
consent
the
test.
what
constitutes
consent?
is
it
concurrence?
is
it...
is
it
failure
to
object?
i
would
suggest
an
easy
test
which
assures
that
the
goals
of
the
iad
are
met
as
a
test
adopted
by
new
york
state
which
is
if
there
was
not
a
defense
requested
or
initiated
continuance,
then
consider
whether
the...
the
continuance
that
was
granted
was
a
good
cause
showing
continuance
which
would
justify
extending
the
statutory
time
periods.
by
doing
that,
by
keeping
the
statute...
statutory
waiver
provisions
narrow,
what
we
do
is
achieve
the
goal
of
assuring
the
public
interests
of
both
sending
states
receiving...
and
receiving
states
are
met.
thank
you,
your
honors.
