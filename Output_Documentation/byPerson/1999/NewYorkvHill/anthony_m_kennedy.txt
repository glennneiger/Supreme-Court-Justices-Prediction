justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
because
the
court
can
reasonably
interpret
the
counsel's
act...
specific
agreement
as
a
waiver
of
the
iad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
defense
counsel
participate
in
drafting
the
initiation
of
rights
under
the
iad,
the
formal...
the
formal...
the
request
for
a
disposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
or
was
the
defense
counsel
appointed
after
he
came
to
new
york.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
assume...
or
maybe
i'm
wrong...
that
the
iad
request
is
in
the...
is
in
the
court
file?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
indication
that
this
defense
counsel
knew
of
the
iad
request?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can't
see
it
in
the
statute.
do
you
happen
to
know
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question?
what
happens
if
the
defendant
is
convicted
in
ohio
but
there's
another
charge
pending
in
ohio,
and
then
there's
a
request
to
go
to
new
york?
can
ohio
insist
on
trying
its
second
charge
before
it
ships?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
my...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
ohio
would
have
an
interest
in
getting
the
prisoner
back,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the...
in
the
hypothetical
instance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the...
if
i
could...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
is
then
there
might
be
an
argument
that
it
is
not
waivable
by
the
defendant
because
then
ohio's
interest
are
prejudiced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
think
we've
got
an
unanswered
question
in
my...
what
we're
trying
to
explore
is
whether
or
not
ohio
has
an
interest
in
not
having
this
time
period
waived,
just
as
arguably
there
is
under
the
speedy
trial
act.
and
so,
there
may
be
instances
where
there's
a
very
serious
charge
in
ohio.
he
wants
to
avoid
that.
so,
he
goes
to
new
york
and
just
continually
waives
and
waives
and
waives.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the
whole
reason
for
a
time
limit
under
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
i
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
waive
the
iad.
i
thought
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he...
he
may
not
have
a
right
to
delay
trial
indefinitely.
i'm
sure
he
doesn't.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
has
a
right
to
waive
the
iad,
and
i
thought
that's
the
whole
point
of
your
case,
that
he
does
and
he
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
let...
let
me
see
if
i
can
understand
your
position.
counsel
for
both
parties
and
the
defendant
are
in
court,
and
the
court
said,
now,
i
know
that
the
180
days
is
going
to
run
in...
in
april.
based
on
my
conversations
with
counsel,
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
both
of
their
calendars
to
try
the
case
beyond
the
180
days.
do
you
waive...
mr.
prisoner
and
your
counsel,
do
you
waive
the
iad?
and
they
say
yes.
you're
telling
me
that
the
court
must
say,
well,
even
if
you
do,
i
cannot
give
you
a
continuance
unless
i...
or
an
extended
date
unless
i
find
good
cause
for
doing
so.
i
cannot
let
you
opt
out
of
the
iad.
i
must
find
that
there
is
good
cause
as
the
iad
finds
that...
defines
that
for
extending
this
trial
date.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
the
iad
was
openly
discussed
by
all
counsel
and
by
the
court.
and
the
court
said,
you
know,
i've
got...
got
a
problem
here.
we've
got...
excludable
time
ends
after
this
proposed
trial
date.
could
the
trial
judge
on
this
record
have
made
a
finding
consistent
with
the
act
that
would
have
allowed
him
to
set
the
trial...
the
may
trial
date?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
a
waiver
in
that
context
makes
a
lot
more
sense
because
the
defendant
could
say,
your
honor,
we
waive
the
necessity
of
those
findings
based
on
this...
the
situation
before
us.
it's...
it's
likely
that
finding
could
be
made.
you
don't
need
to
go
through
that
step.
