justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
it's
no
different
from
any
statutory
speedy
trial,
but
as
i
understand,
at
least
the
federal
speedy
trial
act
is
different
in
that
you
can't
waive
the
time
limits
apart
from
the
express
provisions
in...
in
the
statute
for
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you...
you
started
out
to
say
it's
just
like
the
speedy
trial
act,
but
it
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that's
so
because
doesn't
it
come
within
the
reasonable
and
necessary
continuance?
a
defendant
makes
a
lot
of
motions,
and
it
takes
time
for
the
judge
to
decide
those
motions.
and
if
you
didn't
deduct
that
time,
you
would
be
over
the
180-day
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case,
the
trial
in
ohio
had
already...
he
had
been
convicted
in
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
that
the
ohio
case
was
put
on
hold...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
while
he
went
over
to
new
york.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
so,
it
isn't
the
case
that
one
state
would
have
to
give
up
its
priority
in
trying
the
person.
it's
the
person
that
has
already
been
tried
and
put
in
prison...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
is
asked
to
be
sent
over
to
the
other
state
for
the
second
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
be
a
state
law
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
came
up
from
new
york
state...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
from
the
federal
court.
and
you
were...
you
were
very
careful
to
say,
when
you're
talking
about
procedural
default,
you're
talking
about
procedure
in
federal
courts.
new
york
could
have
it
any
way
it
wants,
couldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
clear?
because
that...
that
was
not
the
same
answer
that
co-counsel
gave.
co-counsel
said
it
would
be
something...
comity
would
be
worked
out
between
the
two
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
shiffrin,
you've
conceded
that
the
defendant
can
trump
that
by
requesting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
this
defendant
comes
first
and...
and
not
the
state
of
ohio.
but
you
talked
about
speedy
trial
provisions.
and
do
you
agree
with
opposing
counsel
who
informed
us
that,
unlike
the
federal
act,
most
state
acts
do
allow
for
waiver
in
circumstances
like
this,
where
counsel
says,
fine,
we'll
have
the
trial
when
the
judge
says?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
the
one
big
difference
is
that
there
is
an
explicit
provision
for
waiver
and
two
situations
in
which
you
can
ask
for
waiver.
one
can
imply
from
that
that
that's
it,
where
opposing
counsel
started
out
here
with
the
point
that
ordinarily
it's
presumed
that
a
statutory
right
is
waivable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
did
what
you
ask,
wouldn't
we
have
to
first
decide
that,
yes,
new
york
can
do
this
compatibly
with
the
federal
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
a
question
that
hasn't
been
argued
and
briefed.
