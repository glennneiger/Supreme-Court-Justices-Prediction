justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
position?
i
don't
understand
you
to
argue
that
this...
this
was
a
necessary
and
reasonable
continuance
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii(a).
you're
just...
you're
just
relying
entirely
on
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
contend
that
it
was
a...
that
you
could...
you
could
prevail
by
arguing
that
that...
this
was
just
a
necessary
and
reasonable
continuance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
was
done
in
open
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
two
lawyers
say
to
the
judge,
it's
inconvenient
to
go
to
trial
on
such
and
such
a
day,
we'd
like
a
later
date,
why
isn't
that
good
cause
for
a
trial
judge?
i
mean,
i
know
this...
i
should
be
asking
your
opponent
this,
but
i'm
just
puzzled
that
you
didn't
make
this
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
mere
fact
that
the
judge
and
both
lawyers
think
the
case
ought
to
be
put
over
is
not
good
cause.
that's
not
a
showing...
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
mere
fact
that
the
trial
judge
and
counsel
on
both
sides
think
a
later
date
is...
would
be...
would
be
better...
would
justify
a
continuance,
that
would
not
be
good
cause
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
did
assert
his
rights.
he
asserted
in
writing,
didn't
he?
he
said
he
wanted
a
trial
within
180
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
has
to
keep
the
prosecutor
advised
to
what
that
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
the
statute
requires
him
to
request
it
twice,
not
just
once.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
obligation
was
on
the
prosecutor.
it
seems
very
likely
that
both
lawyers
overlooked
the
point,
and
then
the
question
is
who
should...
who
should
bear
the
loss.
which
one
has
the
primary
responsibility
after
the
demand
has
been
made?
is
it
the
prosecutor
who
has
a
duty
to
go
forward
or
is
the
defendant...
defendant's
lawyer
have
to
keep
it
in
mind
all
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
say
the
prisoner
is
the
only
person
who
can
invoke
the
right,
why
wouldn't
it
seem
to
follow
naturally
that
he
would
be
the
only
one
who
could
waive
the
right?
and
we
don't
have
any
indication
he
knew
what
was
going
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
normal
tactics
and
all
the
rest.
but
here
you're
waiving
an
important
right.
you
don't
think...
you
don't
think
there's
any...
any
interest...
maybe
it's
not
strong
enough...
making
sure
that
the...
the
defendant
himself
agreed
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
here
you
have
a
statute,
which
you
just
emphasized
the
point,
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
right,
his
lawyer
couldn't
have
invoked
the
right
for
him.
could
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
just
wondering,
given
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
different
in
that
it
says
the
prisoner
has
to
do
it
himself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
just
say,
no,
it
isn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
relationship
to
state
law
and
federal
law
here?
what
if
new
york
had
a
statute
that
said
the
waiver
of
this
right
has
to
be
by...
signed
by
the...
by
the
defendant,
the
prisoner?
would
that
be
trumped
by
the
agreement,
or
would
that
be
enforceable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
my
next
question
would
be
if
the
legislature
could
do
it,
why
can't
the
court
of
appeals
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
a
federal
question
that
would
preempt
any
contrary
new
york...
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
i
notice
in
the
joint
appendix
there
are
a
series
of
forms
that
are
form
iii,
form
vi,
and
form
so
forth
that
are
prepared
under
the
agreement,
the
statute.
is
there...
is
there
a
form
that's
been
prepared
to
deal
with
the
situation
we
have
before
us
in
this
case?
see,
one
of
the...
i
think
the
strongest
argument
against
your
position
is
that
if
you
had
a
form,
you
always
get
the
lawyer
to
sign
the
form,
you
won't
have
this
argument
again
about
whether
there's
a
waiver.
but
i
guess
there
isn't
a
form...
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
gather
your
answer
is
there
isn't
really
a
form
such
as
i'm...
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
had
such
a
form
and
executed,
we
wouldn't
have
these
problems
anymore.
