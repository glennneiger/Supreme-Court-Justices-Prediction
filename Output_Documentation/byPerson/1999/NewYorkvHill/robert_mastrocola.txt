mr.
robert
mastrocola
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
or
iad,
which
establishes
a
set
of
procedures
for
the
interjurisdictional
transfer
of
prisoners
from...
who
are
facing
charges
in
the
other
jurisdiction.
it's
our
position
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
permitted
to
expressly
agree
to
a
trial
date
which
is
beyond
the
time
period
prescribed
by
the
iad
and
then
turn
around
and,
on
the
basis
of
that
very
violation
of
the
right,
because
it's
been
conducted
after
the
time
period,
have
his
charges
dismissed.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
it
is
proper
for
the
defense
attorney
in
these
circumstances
to
make
those
decisions.
and
therefore,
yes,
a
waiver...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
by
defense
counsel
is
sufficient
for
the
court
to
rely
on.
in
this
case,
respondent
was
transferred
from
ohio
to
new
york
to
face
murder
and
robbery
charges,
and
following
the
completion
of
pretrial
proceedings,
the
parties
met
in
court
for
the
express
purpose
of
setting
a
trial
date.
a
date
was
proposed
by
the
court.
defense
counsel
expressly
agreed
to
that,
said
that
would
be
fine.
so,
the
date
was
set.
now,
that
date
happened
to
be
beyond
the
180-day
period.
once
that...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
i
don't
know
that
either...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
they...
they
certainly
can
do
that,
and
frankly,
the
courts
can
do
that
as
well.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
but
i
think
the
question
here
then
is,
is
that
an
absolute
requirement?
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
i
think,
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
you
could
also
posit
that
in
fact
you
would
assume
that
all
the
parties
are
aware
of
the
rights
and
aware
of
the
time
provisions
and
they
don't
need
to
expressly
discuss
those
provisions
at
the
time.
when
they're
setting
a
trial
date,
if
it
happens
to
be
outside
the
period,
that's
understood.
and
if
defense
counsel
wants
to
agree
to
that,
that's
fine,
and
if
he
doesn't,
he
can
say
he
doesn't
want
for...
because
it's
outside
the
period
or
for
any
other
reason.
so,
there's
no
obligation
to
conduct
a
full
colloquy
regarding
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
and
the
particular
trial
provisions.
it's
no
different
from
any
other
statutory
speedy
trial
right,
for
that
matter.
in
this
case...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
the
federal
speedy
trial
act,
unlike
the
iad,
does
contain
an
express
waiver
provision,
and
it
also
has
been
interpreted,
because
of
its
legislative
history
which
specifically
indicates
that
the
intent
was
that
a
defendant
could
not
waive
that,
and
therefore
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
that
is
not
waivable
by
a
defendant.
you
don't
have
any
express
language
in
the
iad
regarding
waiver.
you
have
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
iad
indicating
that
waiver
was
meant
to
be
precluded.
and
in
fact,
the
iad
was
enacted,
against
this
background
presumption,
that
statutory
rights
are
normally
waivable.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
i
apologize.
yes,
the
federal
speedy
trial
act
would
be
distinguishable
on
that
basis.
i'm
referring
to
what
my
understanding
is
of
the
basis
for
most
typical
state
speedy
trial
statutes
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
no.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
it's
our
position
that
the
necessary
and
reasonable
continuance
provisions,
specifically
in
the
statute...
that
also
includes
a
good
cause
standard,
and
it
also
has
to
be
done
in
open
court.
and
it's
our
position...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
but
there
was
no...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
i
believe
because
it
was
in
the
nature
of
the
colloquy
here
and
there
was
no
discussion
about
the
reasons
why
that
was
done,
because
there
was
no
need
for
the...
any
discussion.
once
the
date
was
proposed
and
the
counsel
agreed
to
it,
there
was
no
need
for
a
discussion
as
to
why
that
was
or
was
not
appropriate.
and
so,
it
was
just
accepted
by
the
court
that
that
was...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
i
think
if
there's
some
articulation
as
to
what
the
reason
was,
other
than
just
indicating,
as
you
typically
do
in
trial
practice,
when
the
parties
get
together
and
a
date
is
selected.
a
lot
of
times,
unless
there
is
a
problem
with
that
date,
you
don't
get
any
discussion
as
to
why
or
why...
why
it's
not
good.
the
parties
just
agree
and...
and
it's
understood
that
that's
going
to
work
out
for
everybody
and
it's
acceptable.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
it's
our
position
that
that
provision
of
the
iad
really
applies
for
when
the
government
is
seeking
a
continuance
over
the
defendant's
objection.
that's
why
we
have
the
statutory
presumption
of
waivability.
if
the
defendant
wants
to
waive
it,
that's
fine,
but
if
the
government
needs
a
continuance
and
the
defendant
wants
to
object,
the
court
can
go
ahead
and
find
good
cause.
and
i
think...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
i
think
under
a
very
strict
interpretation
of
that
term,
that's
correct.
the
courts
over
the
years,
though,
have
basically
treated
it
as...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
the
courts...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
courts
use
both
the
good
cause
continuance
provision,
as
well
as
a
separate
provision
in
the
iad,
which
says
that
you
don't
count
time
when
the
defendant
is
unable
to
stand
trial.
that's
also
been
interpreted
as
allowing
tolling
of
the
time
periods.
when
you're
calculating
the
time
period,
you
toll
those
periods
when
there's
defense
motions
or
other
things
the
defense
has
done.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
saying
because
that
is
a
tactical
decision,
a
case
management
decision
in
terms
of
the
trial
date,
which
counsel
is
entitled
to
make.
there
is
no
need
for
any
kind
of
specific
on-the-record
inquiry
of
counsel
about
this.
the
court
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
counsel
is
managing
the
case
properly.
and
therefore,
when
he
agrees
to
that
trial
date,
he
is
not
entitled
then
to
come
in
and
await
the
statutory
period
to
run
and
say,
aha,
i
got
you.
now,
you
have
to
dismiss
the
case.
the
court...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that's
right
because
counsel
has
done
something
on
behalf
of
the
defense
that
is
contrary
to
or
inconsistent
with
relying
on
those
rights
under
the
iad.
the
court
of
appeals
here
made
the
distinction
that
even
though
the
right
is
waivable
and
the
defense
counsel
merely
concurred
in
the
trial
date...
he
didn't
actually
ask
for
the
date...
and
on
the
basis
of
that
distinction,
they
said
there
was
no
waiver.
in
other
words,
even
though
the
defense
had
fully
agreed
to
be
treated
in
a
fashion
contrary
to
the
iad,
he
didn't
actually
ask
to
be
treated
in
such
a
contrary
fashion.
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
finding
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
the
iad,
and
on
that
basis,
they
set
aside
the
convictions
and
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that's
correct.
this
defendant
was
convicted
of
murder
and
robbery
and
received
up
to
a
life
sentence.
and
the
court,
on
that
distinction,
which
we
submit
is
an
improper
and
obviously
a
very
fine
distinction,
found
that
there
was
no
waiver.
we
believe
that
once...
again,
the
standard
about
acting
contrary
to
or
inconsistent
with
your
rights
under
the
statute,
in
this
case
the
iad,
is
a
workable
standard
for
a
court
to
rely
on.
and
therefore,
they
can
determine
that
under
those...
under
that
standard
when
a
defendant
has,
in
fact,
waived
his
rights.
it's
important
i
think
to
remember
also
that
the
iad,
like
other
speedy
trial
statutes...
and
again,
referring
to
the
particular
state
speedy
trial
statutes...
it's
not
intended
to
be
a
trap
that
the
defense
can
spring
on
the
court.
at
some
point,
the
defendant
does
have
an
obligation
to
assert
his
rights
or
he
loses
them.
now,
there...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that
was
how
the
process
was
initiated,
your
honor,
but...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
he
doesn't
have
to
keep
the
prosecutor
advised,
but
at
some
point,
if
he
is
given
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
he
continues
to
insist
on
those
rights,
he
has
to
indicate
that.
all
he
has
to
do,
if
he
wants
to
maintain
that
right...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
he
has...
well,
no,
he
has
to
refrain
from
doing
something
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
he's
no
longer
relying
on
those
rights.
and
when
a
court
specifically,
instead
of
forcing
a
date
on
counsel,
when
a
court
gives
the
respondent
an
opportunity
for
input
into
that
decision
and
if
the
date
proposed
happens
to
be
outside
that,
at
that
point
there
is
an
obligation
for
the
defendant
to
speak
up.
now,
it
may
be...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
it
is,
just
like
any
other
decision
defense
counsel
has
to
make,
that
is
part
of
the
case
management.
and
again,
if...
in
a
situation
where
at
least
at
a
minimum
he's
given
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
he's
going
to
continue
to
rely
on
those
rights
or
not,
it's
fair
then,
when
he
indicates
that
he's
not,
for
the
court
to
reasonably
rely
on
that.
obviously,
in
a
perfect
world,
it
would...
everybody
would
be
aware
of
their
rights.
there
would
be
a
discussion
of
their
rights
probably
every
time
they
come
into
court
and
that
would
all
be
well
and
good.
but
the
question
now
is
when
that
doesn't
happen,
is
it
fair
then
for...
to
say
that
the
court
acted
reasonably
based
on
what
representations
came
from
the
respondent's
side.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
the
particular
detainer
form
in
this
case?
mr.
robert
mastrocola
counsel
was
assigned
to
the
case
when
he
came
to
new
york
when
the
defendant...
when
respondent
was
transferred
from
ohio
to
new
york
and
proceedings
began
is
my
understanding.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
it
is
part
of
the
record,
yes.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
in
terms
of
an
affirmative
indication?
i
don't
believe
there
is,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
he
doesn't.
again,
my
understanding,
again
this
is
just
with
our
practice
in
new
york,
is
there
is
full
pretrial
discovery,
and...
and
any
of
these
sorts
of
documents
are
provided
during
the
course
of
pretrial
discovery.
and
there
also
is...
and
again,
counsel
certainly
was
aware
that
this
defendant
was
being
transferred
from
ohio
to
new
york
and
that
he
was
imprisoned
in
ohio.
and
i
think
in...
in
toto
then
it
certainly
can
be
assumed
that
counsel
was
aware
of
that.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
i
think,
your
honor...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
in
the
normal
course
of
things,
the
180-day
period,
as
with
most
speedy
trial
statutes,
is
not
a
chronological
period.
it's
understood
that
you're
not
actually
going
to
have
a
trial
within
the
180
days
because
of
all
these
pretrial
proceedings.
so,
it's
not
that
the
case...
they
can
honestly
expect
that
they're
going
to
get
this
defendant
back
within
180
days.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
now,
they
may
have
an
interest
in
getting
that
prisoner
back,
but
that
interest
is
secondary
to
this
prisoner's
interest
and
what
he
wants
to
do
facing
these
charges
in
the
case
that
he's
facing
on
the
matter
that
he's
been
transferred
on.
and
it's
i
think
important
to
note
that
whatever
interest
the
sending
state
has
in
terms
of...
and
i
think...
are
you
referring
to
the
prison
authorities?
mr.
robert
mastrocola
and
the...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
yes.
that's...
again,
that
concern
is
secondary
to
the
prisoner's
interest
in
terms
of
how
he
wants
to
control
the
case
because
the
whole
focus
of
the
iad
is
on
how
this
may
affect
the
prisoner
in
terms
of
his
rehabilitation.
now,
obviously...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
right.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
no.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
no.
the
iad
applies
when
the
person
is
actually
serving
a
sentence...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
right.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
he's...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
under
the
iad...
and
i
think
this...
this
goes
back
to
your
earlier
question
about
the...
the
sending
state's
interest.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
the
sending
state
cannot
initiate
itself
any
procedures
for
transfer
under
the
iad.
the
iad
reserves
exclusively
to
the
prisoner
the
absolute
control
over
whether
he
is
going
to
activate
the
transfer
to
the
other
state.
now,
if
the
detainer,
of
course,
being
lodged...
i
would
guess
it
would
be
a
matter
of
comity
between
the
states
if,
in
fact,
our...
our
state
lodged
detainer
and
said,
we
would
like
to
come
and
get
him,
but
the
other
state
said,
well,
we
have
charges
here.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
normally
that
jurisdiction
where
the...
where
the
prisoner
is
and...
and
has
charges
pending
would
take
precedence,
and
we
would
normally
await
that.
but
again,
the
idea
is
that
the...
whatever
interest
there
is
in
the
sending
state
is
secondary
to
the
prisoner's.
and
they
have
no
right,
no
matter
how
they
want
to
either
send
the
prisoner
or
get
him
back,
to
do
anything
under
the
iad.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
could
perhaps
clear
up
a
couple
of
things.
waiver
of
a
federal
law
or
a
federal
right
is
a
federal
question.
the
iad
is
a
federal
law.
we
need
uniform
interpretation.
that's
why
this
court,
in
fact,
has
taken
some
previous
cases
to
resolve
particular
issues
of
interpretation
of
the
iad
instead
of
letting
50
different
states
have
their
own
interpretations.
whether
there
are
state
procedural
rules
in
terms
of
appellate
practice
and
whether
issues
can
be
raised,
that
deals
with
forfeiture.
that's
a
separate
issue.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
scope
is
of
waiver
of
the
iad
as
a
federal
standard.
with
respect
to
the
questions
about
what
if
ohio
has
a
charge,
i
just
wanted
to
suggest
one
thing.
if
in
fact
the
sending
state
also
has
criminal
charges
pending,
as
i
suggested
before,
it
might
be
a
matter
of
comity
between
the
states.
if
the
defendant
initiated
this
procedure
and
wanted
to
go
back
to
new
york,
and
ohio
insisted
that
they
wanted
to
try
them
there,
i
think
very
clearly
there
is
a
provision
under
the
iad
which
says
the
time
is
tolled
whenever
a
defendant
is
unable
to
stand
trial.
and
that
could
very
easily
be
invoked
based
on
some
sort
of
agreement
between
the
states
because
even
though
he's
invoked
it
here,
ohio
wants
to
take
precedence.
they'll
just
delay
until
that's
done
in
ohio.
so,
that
can
be
invoked
right
under
the
iad.
that's
not
a
problem.
as
far
as
the
sending
state's
interest
in
this
prisoner
and
about,
well,
ohio
wanted
this
individual
back
as
soon
as
possible,
the
statute
itself
requires
it.
as
soon
as
the
proceedings
are
terminated
in
the
receiving
state,
he
has
to
go
back
to
the
sending
state.
so,
this
wasn't
a
matter
of
ohio
contacting
new
york
regularly
and
say,
we
want
this
guy,
we
want
this
guy,
you
know,
when
you
going
to
be
done.
he
just
goes
back
automatically.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
because
what
happens
is
the
prisoner
is
always
in
another
state
when
he
activates
these
proceedings.
he
just...
he's
given
a
choice
and
he
wants
to
tell
the
sending
state
that...
or
the
receiving
state
that
he
wants
to
face
these
charges.
that's
all
done
while
he's
in
prison.
once
he
comes
back
into
the
other
state,
the
receiving
state,
then
it
starts
like
a
regular
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
think
in
response
to
one
of
the
other
questions
about
counsel,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
bar
to
the
state
assigning
counsel
in
the
receiving
state
if
he
wants
to
consult
with
the
defendant
about
whether
he
wants
to
initiate
this
process
or
whatever.
his
rights
can
be
protected
if...
if
necessary
or
if
the
court
wants
to.
that's
not
necessarily
required
while
he's
still
in
ohio...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
there's
no
form,
no.
but
there's
no
form
required
for
waiver
of
a
right,
a
statutory
right,
that
i'm
aware
of
in
any
other
context.
mr.
robert
mastrocola
well,
you've
got
the
distinction
between
when
he's
in
prison
and
when
he's
starting
the
process
and
then
what
happens
sometime
later
once
he's
been
transferred
to
the
other
state
and
now
he's
into
the
process
of
the
criminal
prosecution
in
that
state.
the
sending
state,
to
the
extent
it
has
an
interest
in
rehabilitation,
let's
not
forget
that
rehabilitation
starts
with
the
defendant.
so,
it's
not
just
the
interest
of
the
sending
state
in
saying,
we
want
to
get
this
prisoner
back
here
to
rehabilitate
him.
it's
got
to
be
dependent
on
what
that
prisoner's
state
of
mind
is.
that's
what
the
whole
focus
of
this
iad
is,
and
that's
why
it
gives
the
prisoner
the
right,
if
he
wants
to,
to
decide
i'm
not
going
to
stay
in
prison,
i'm
going
to
go
back.
it
gives
him
the
choice.
and
i
would
submit
that
in
terms
of
this
public
policy,
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding
in
the
sense
that
the
iad
has
been
with
us
now
for
some
40
years.
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
these
rights
waivable,
and
there
has
been
no
indication
by
the
states,
no
outcry,
that
somehow
this
is
impeding
the
sending
state's
interest.
there
has
been
no
rush
to
drop
out
of
the
iad,
and
in
fact,
over
the
years,
despite
this
waivability
principle,
states
have
continued
to
join
to
the
point
where
now
every
one
but
two
states
are
party
to
this
agreement.
and
again,
just
for
clarification,
we're
not
talking
about
a
right
to
waiver.
we're
talking
about...
mr.
robert
mastrocola
louisiana
and
mississippi,
and
there
may
be
something...
some
joke
there,
but
i
don't
want
to
say
it
at
this
point.
[laughter]
basically...
