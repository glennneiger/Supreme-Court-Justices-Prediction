justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
presents
a
challenge
to
section
505
of
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996.
the
section
505
requires
cable
television
operators
who
provide
channels,
and
this
is
the
statutory
phrase
"primarily
dedicated
to
sexually-oriented
programming"
either
to,
and
again
this
is
the
statute,
"fully
scramble
or
otherwise
fully
block"
those
channels
or
to
limit
them
to
hours
when
children
are
unlikely
to
be
viewing.
the
federal
communications
commission
has
set
those
hours
to
include
the
time
between
10
p.m.
and
6
a.m.
now,
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
cable
operators
used
scrambling
to
limit
access
to
certain
programs
for
the
customers
have
paid
for.
scrambling
can
be
imprecise,
however
and
the
audio
or
visual
portions
of
the
scrambled
programs
sometimes
can
be
heard
or
seen,
and
this
phenomenon
is
known
as
"signal
bleed".
the
purpose
of
section
505
is
to
shield
children
from
signal
bleed.
to
comply
with
the
statute,
most
cable
operators
adopted
the
time
channeling
approach.
now,
that
is
to
say
they
broadcast
the
material
in
question
only
after
10
o'clock
in
the
evening
and
before
six
in
the
morning.
the
effect
of
the
widespread
adoption
of
the
time
channeling
was
to
eliminate
the
day
time
transmission
of
the
targeted
programming
whether
or
not
any
particular
viewer
wanted
to
receive
it.
the
playboy
entertainment
group
challenged
the
statute.
after
a
trial,
a
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
a
different
section
of
the
act,
section
504,
which
allows
individual
viewers
to
request
channels
to
be
blocked
on
a
household-by-household
basis
would
be
an
effective
less
restrictive
alternative
to
section
505,
if
the
blocking
were
adequately
publicized.
the
district
court
held
section
505
violates
the
first
amendment.
we
agree
and
now
affirm.
two
essential
points
should
be
understood:
first,
we
assume
even
many
adults
would
find
this
material
highly
offensive
and
when
we
consider
that
it
comes
unwanted
into
the
homes
where
children
might
see
or
hear
it
against
parental
wishes,
there
are
legitimate
reasons
for
regulating
it;
the
second,
all
parties
bring
the
case
to
us
on
the
premise
that
playboy's
programming
has
first
amendment
protection.
as
this
case
has
been
litigated,
the
programming
is
not
alleged
to
be
obscene.
adults
have
a
constitutional
right
to
view
it
and
playboy
has
a
right
to
transmit
it.
since
505
is
a
content-based
restriction
of
protected
speech,
it
can
stand
only
if
it
satisfies
strict
scrutiny.
it
must
be
narrowly
tailored
to
promote
a
compelling
government
interest
and
if
a
less
restrictive
alternative
would
serve
the
government's
purpose,
the
legislature
must
use
that
alternative.
like
broadcast
television,
cable
programs
can
be
transmitted
to
homes
where
there
are
not
wanted
and
where
parents
often
are
not
present
to
give
immediate
guidance.
but
there
is
also
a
key
difference
between
cable
television
and
the
broadcasting
media.
cable
systems
have
the
capacity
to
block
unwanted
channels
on
a
household-by-household
basis.
targeted
blocking
is
less
restrictive
than
banning,
and
the
government
cannot
ban
speech
of
targeted
blocking
as
a
feasible
and
effective
means
of
furthering
its
compelling
interests.
when
a
plausible,
less
restrictive
alternative
has
offered
to
a
content-based
speech
restriction,
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proving
the
alternative
will
not
be
effective
to
achieve
its
goals.
the
government
did
not
meet
that
burden
here.
the
government
pointed
out
that
section
504,
which
was
the
blocking
provision
was
only
in
effect
for
over
a
year
and
that
there
were
a
few
requests
for
household-by-household
blocking
during
that
time.
the
district
court
explored
the
possible
reasons
for
this.
first,
the
actual
signal
bleed
problem
might
be
a
far-less
concern
then
the
government
had
it
first
supposed,
although
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
otherwise
at
trial
that
presented
no
proof
of
the
actual
extent
of
the
problem.
there
was
no
proof
as
to
how
likely
any
child
is
to
view
a
discernible
explicit
image,
and
no
proof
of
the
duration
of
the
signal
bleed
or
the
quality
of
the
pictures
or
the
sound.
the
first
amendment
requires
a
more
careful
assessment
and
characterization
of
an
evil
to
justify
a
regulation
as
sweeping
as
this.
second,
it
is
possible
that
section
504,
the
blocking
provision,
would
be
effective
if
the
public
were
given
adequate
notice.
the
district
court
called
for
proof
on
this
point
and
once
again
the
government
failed
to
meet
its
burden.
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
well
promoted
voluntary
blocking
provision
could
not
inform
parents
about
signal
bleed
and
about
their
rights
to
have
the
bleed
blocked
if
they
consider
it
a
problem.
the
government
has
not
shown
that
section
504
whether
in
a
regime
of
added
communication
and
support
would
be
insufficient
to
secure
its
objective,
or
that
any
overriding
harm
justifies
its
intervention.
the
opinion
explains
at
some
detail
the
technical
aspects
of
this
case
including
any
future
advent
of
digitized
technology,
which
may
resolve
the
problem.
the
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
section
505
violated
the
first
amendment.
justice
stevens

thomas

filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
scalia

opinion
and

which
