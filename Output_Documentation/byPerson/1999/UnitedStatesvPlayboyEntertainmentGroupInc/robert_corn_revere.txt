mr.
robert
corn-revere
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
regulatory
overkill.
section
505
of
the
telecommunications
act
violates
the
first
amendment
because,
as
the
district
court
found,
the
law
significantly
restricts
playboy's
opportunities
to
convey
and
the
opportunity
of
playboy's
viewers
to
receive
protected
speech.
the
government
here
is
asking
for
greater
flexibility
to
regulate
which
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
euphemism
for
expanding
governmental
authority
over
protecting...
protected
speech.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
yes,
it
did.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
i
don't
know
you'd
find
that
in...
in
the
findings
of
fact
other
than
in
the
conclusions
of
law
that
indecency
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
there
wasn't
a
specific
finding
on
whether
or
not
we
are
dealing
with
obscenity
here,
but
perhaps
the
confusion
that
arises
from
that
point
comes
with
the
emphasis
the
government
has
placed
on
certain
exhibits
that
give
an
atypical
view
of...
of
really
what's
out
there.
they
lodged
with
this
court
a
number
of
videotapes
that
they
hand-selected
and
found
from
the
most
explicit
examples
they
could
find
out
there.
in
particular,
they
focused
on
a...
a
service
called
spice
hot
which
only
came
into
existence
after
section
505
was
adopted.
at
the
time
in
the
record
it
was
available
in
only
20
cable
systems
and
there's
no
indication
of
whether
or
not
it
was
subject
to
signal
bleed
on
any
of
them.
they
also
focused
on
a
service
called
adultvision
which
the
record
reflected
doesn't
even
have
signal
bleed.
it's
available
only
on
totally
encrypted
systems.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
that's
not
quite
correct.
the
actual
language,
justice
scalia,
in
section
505
is
that
it
applies
to
channels
that
are
primarily
dedicated
to
sexually
oriented
programming.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
i
would...
i
would
describe
playboy
television
as
one
of
those
channels.
it
is
primarily
dedicated
to
sexually
oriented
programming,
but
we
have
disagreed
from
the
beginning
that
it's
necessarily
dedicated
to
indecency
or
much
less
obscenity.
and
as
a
result,
we
had
a
running
argument
with
the
government
over
the
nature
of
the
indecency
standard
and
how
it
applies
to
these
channels
because
it
requires
certain
determinations
that
are
difficult
to
make
and
certainly
have
not
been
made
and
not
been
clarified
by
the
government
on
this
record.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
yes,
it
was,
and
as
a
result,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
applies
in
a
much
more
broad
way,
not
to
anything
approaching
obscenity,
but
to
channels
that
are
primarily
dedicated
to
sexually
oriented--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--and
i
don't--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--well,
and
that
was
actually
the
underlying
premise
of
the
district
court's
decision.
and
in
fact,
it
looked
at
a
number
of
specific
examples
of
playboy
programming
that
we
had
submitted
to
the
fcc
asking
for
a
ruling
of
whether
or
not
it
was
indecent.
our
argument
was
that
playboy
television
is
analogous
to
playboy
magazine
and
includes
a
number
of
features,
including
what
you
would
expect,
nude
models
and
so
on,
and
as
well
as
other
features
that
are
difficult
to...
to
characterize
even
as
indecent.
and
out
of
that
broad
editorial
content,
we--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--well,
yes,
there
is.
but
we...
we
have
argued
that
because
of
the
statutory
vagueness,
that
it's
impossible
to
distinguish
what
might
be
prohibited
from
what
might
otherwise
be
wrapped
up
in
the
requirements
of
section
505,
and
none
of
that
approaches
what
i
think
this
court's
rulings
have
said
about
obscenity,
much
less
indecency.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
i'm
not
aware
of
a
specific
statute
that
touches
on
basic
cable
channels.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
the
tradition
is...
is
that
they
do
not,
although
again
i
don't
know
of
a
regulation
that
touches
on
that,
except
for
the
regulation
that
this...
this
court
addressed
in
the
denver
area
case
which
dealt
with
leased
access
channels
which
are
not
subscription
channels.
they're
presented
as
basic
channels.
and
the
government's
argument
in
that
case
is
that
leased
access
channels
presented
indecency
and
therefore
needed
to
be
regulated.
this
court's
decision
in
the
denver
area
case
is
quite
pertinent
to
this
case
because
it
recognized
a
governmental
interest,
but
yet
found
that
the
regulations
imposed
would
restrict
more
speech
than
necessary
and
adopted
instead
the
analysis
that
the
government
should
have
focused
on
less
restrictive
means.
that
is--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--well,
in
fact,
we
do
argue
that
the
statute
applies
to
any
channel
that
is
primarily
dedicated
to
sexually
oriented
programming,
whatever
channels
those
may
be.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
this
case
is
that
we
did
ask
the
government
for
an
ability
to
try
and
distinguish
between
that
which
is
sexually--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--yes,
and
that
was
the
heart
of
the
district
court
decision.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
we
acknowledged
before
the
district
court
that
playboy
is
primarily
dedicated
to
sexually
oriented
programming,
but
disagreed
on
whether
or
not
we
crossed
the
line
into
indecency
in
many
cases.
and
that
is
part
of
the
difficulty
with
this
statute.
while
it
applies
to
networks
in
general
that
are
sexually
oriented,
the
safe
harbor
prohibitions
and
the
actual
restrictions
of
section
505
are
supposed
to
target
only
that
which
is
indecent
or
that
which
is
sexually
explicit
adult
programming.
the
difficulty
is
the
statute
doesn't
provide
the
analytic
tools
necessary
for
dividing
one
from
the
other,
and
we
think
that
the
network
does
carry
programming
that
should
be
able
to
be
presented
in
the
non-safe
harbor
hours
that
once
again
the
government
has
not
been
able
to
define
for
us.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government's
definition
of
the
case,
as
a
facial
matter
of
the
indecency
standard
and
has
litigated
in
this
case,
is
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
hard-core
pornography,
as
justice
scalia
was
mentioning
earlier,
and
safe
sex
information
if
it's
presented
on
playboy
television.
and
as
a
result,
the
overbreadth
and
the
restrictiveness
of
section
505
is
exacerbated.
and
in
fact,
for
that
reason
too,
the
issue
of
least
restrictive
means
becomes
paramount.
as
the
district
court
found,
section
504
would
appear
to
be
as
effective
as
section
505
for
those
concerned
about
signal
bleed
while
clearly
less
restrictive
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
justice
kennedy,
that's
why
we
would
agree--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--no.
i
think
findings
of
fact
would
be
required
to
determine
that
section
504
was
ineffective
because
it's
the
government's
burden
of
proof
to
demonstrate
that
they
have
adopted
the
least
restrictive
means.
and
with
respect
to
the
government's
argument
that
it
is
simply
too
expensive,
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
is
clear--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--well--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--i
think
when
it
comes
to
making
a
decision
that's
going
to
restrict
a
significant
amount
of
speech
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution,
that
something
more
would
be
required
than
simply
an
assumption.
and
in
fact,
this
is
the
very
argument
that
the
government
presented
in
the
denver
area
case
involving
indecency
on
leased
access
channels,
in
fact,
in
almost
the
same
language
that
they've
presented
here.
if
you
look
at
pages
36
to
37
of
the
government's
brief
to
this
court
in
denver
area,
which
unfortunately
i
guess
you
wouldn't
have
today,
the
government
claimed,
just
as
it
does
here
that
innumerable
parents,
through
absence,
distraction,
indifference,
inertia,
insufficient
information,
would
fail
to
take
advantage
of
subscriber
initiated
measures
to
protect
children
from
viewing
indecent
programming.
it's
almost
identical
to
the--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--i
think
it
would
require--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--i...
i
think
that
would
require
an
analysis
of
whether
or
not
less
restrictive
measures
than
a
ban
would
also
touch
on
that
problem.
and
that
also
is
the
distinction
that
we've
drawn
between
this
court's
holding
in
pacifica
which
applied
to
broadcasting
and
this
case
where
there
are
less
restrictive
measures.
and
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
some
parents
may
not
be
fully
attentive,
as
justice
kennedy's
question
got
to,
i
think
the
court's
analysis
in
denver
area
speaks
to
that
issue.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
my
response,
justice
souter,
is
that
we
at
least
ought
to
try
that
first
before
we
decide
that
we're
going
to
restrict
a
significant
amount
of
protected
speech.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
i
think
it's
no
more
utopian
than
this
court
was
being
in
denver
area
where
it
listed
other
alternative
measures
that
would
have
been
less
restrictive,
including
a
possible
coding
requirement
or
blocking
available
by
a
phone
call,
which
is
what
we
have
with
section
504.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
yes,
i
do.
i
think
the
notice
could
be
effective,
and...
and
we
detail
the
number
of
measures
that
playboy
was
prepared
to
do
and
the
national
cable
television
association--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--it
can
take
various
forms
and,
in
fact,
has
in
practice.
it
can
be
a
video
announcement
that
is
made
on
various
channels
on
the
cable
system.
it
could
be
written
notice
that
is
sent
separately
from
bills.
it
could
be
a
written
notice--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--it
would
say
that
there
is
a
phenomenon
known
as
signal
bleed,
that...
that
many
households
may
find
offensive
that
may
contain
sexually
explicit
or
sexually
oriented
programming
and
that
you
have
a
right
to
block
it.
in
fact,
there
are
examples
in
the
record
of
a
number
of
cable
operators
who
sent
such
notices
and
had
visual
information
on
it
to
get
the
attention
of
the
subscriber
to
provide
that
notice.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
the
inference
that
the
government
makes
that
that
demonstrates
the
ineffectiveness
of
notice
provision
simply
underscores
the
government's
failure
to
demonstrate
the
pervasiveness
and
difficulty
of
solving
signal
bleed.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
it's
partly
a
burden
of
proof
issue,
and
that's
how
the
district
court
viewed
it
when
they
suggested
that
if
there
is
a
low
rate
of
lockbox
distribution,
that
that
is
as
indicative
of
the
fact
that
the
government
never
demonstrated
the
pervasiveness
of
the
issue
in
the
first
place.
it's
also
important
to
note
that
section
505
is
not
the
only
means
out
there...
and
nor
is
section
504...
for
dealing
with
the
phenomenon
of
signal
bleed
in
those
places
where
it
occurs,
as
the
government
conceded
it
very
significantly
from
time
to
time
and
place
to
place.
and
the
market
has
provided
a
number
of
mechanisms
to
allow
individuals
to
deal
with
signal
bleed
even
without
respect
to
government
regulations.
for
example,
80
percent
of
the
televisions
on
the
market
on
this
record
have
channel
locking
features
that
will
also
block
signal
bleed.
the
same
is
true
of
vcr's
on
the
market
and...
and
cable
television
set-top
boxes.
there
are
a
number
of
ways
that
you
can
deal--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
i...
i
can't
tell
you,
based
on
the
record,
how
many
televisions
are
currently
in
homes
that
have
channel
locking
features,
but
we
do
know
that
80
percent
of
those
on
the
market
have
them
and
that
approximately
20
to
30
million
televisions
are
sold
every
year.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
that's
right,
and
that's
one--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--the
maximum
possible
without
respect
to
these
other
measures
that
others
might
use.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
no,
it
doesn't,
and
that's
one
of
the
curious
things
about
the
record
because
that's
one
of
the
issues
that
the
district
court
asked
the
government
to
demonstrate
more
fully
at
the
permanent
injunction
stage.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
there
were
a
number
of
tapes.
most
of
the
tapes
that
the
government
submitted
were
in
the
clear
and
weren't
examples
of
scrambled
imagery.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
let
me
address
those.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
i
think
given
the
range
of
other
media
that
are
available--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--i
think--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--well,
not...
not
if
you
look
at
the
government's
tapes,
particularly
tape
number
2
which...
which
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
tape
number
2
was
actually
a
compilation
tape
made
by
a
department
of
justice
attorney.
it
was
edited
down
from
a
4-hour
tape.
if
you
look
at
tape
number
2,
you'll
see
every
now
and
then
2
or
3
seconds
of
an
image
you
can
see,
and
if
you
add
it
all
up,
82
percent
of
that
image
is
completely
blocked.
you
see
nothing.
if
you
look
at
the
4-hour
tape,
rather
than
the
government's
greatest
hits
tape--
[laughter]
--you
get
something
like
93
percent
of
the
programming
is
completely
blocked.
it
does
vary
from
time
to
time
and
place
to
place,
but
the
government
never
even
attempted
to
demonstrate
the
phenomenon
of--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--yes,
primarily.
but
the
audio
transmission
varies
as
well.
tape
number
44,
which
justice
ginsburg
also
alluded
to,
the
audio
tends
to
come
in
and
out,
just
as
in
the
other
examples
the
video
may.
the
phenomenon
of
signal
bleed
varies
significantly
from
time
to
time
and
place
to
place
based
on
a
range
of
different
factors,
including
the
equipment
used,
its
installation,
its
maintenance,
and
even
factors
such
as
the
weather.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
a
blanket,
across-the-board
approach
is
strikingly
inappropriate
and,
for
that
reason,
is
overly
broad,
rather
than
a
tailored
solution
such
as
section
504--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--that's--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--notwithstanding
those
practical
difficulties,
every
one
of
the
examples
that
the
government
was
able
to
provide...
and
it
really
was
only
a
few
anecdotal
examples...
where
signal
bleed
occurred,
the
individuals
were
able
to
get
blocking
from
the
cable
operator
upon
request.
and
that
was
a
factual
finding
of
the
district
court.
and
while
i
recognize
the
difficulties
of
opting
in,
this
is
different
from
the
denver
area
case
in
this
respect,
in
that
if
you
decide
to
make
a
single
phone
call,
you
have
blocked
the
channel
that
you're
concerned
about.
whereas,
in
denver
area,
as
justice
thomas
pointed
out
in
his
separate
opinion
in
denver
area,
the
difficulty
on
leased
access
indecency
is
that
you
had
no
central
editor
and
you
didn't
know
when
an
indecent
program
may
appear.
here
the
voluntary
solution
of
making
that
call
is
a
lot
more
effective
because
you
have
to
just
deal
with
that--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--well,
it
would
depend
on
the
method
that
the
cable
operator
uses
to
address
the
issue.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
we
disagree
that
it
would
necessarily
require
a
service
call
since
someone
is
calling
in
to
ask
for
a
trap
that
can
be
attached
to
the
television
set.
and
in
fact,
the
government
presented
evidence
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage
that
traps
could
be
installed
very
easily
by
the
cable
subscriber.
you
wouldn't
have
to--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--just
as
a
point
of
clarification,
it's
not
playboy
that
responds
to
those
calls.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
and...
and
also
signal
bleed
doesn't
intrude
on
other
channels.
it
would
occur
only
on
the
channel
on
which
playboy
was
designated.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
the
normal
practice
has
been
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
that's
right.
but
that
is
not
necessarily
what
would
need
to
be
required.
as
the
court
found
below,
if
there
were
a
lot
more
requests
for
traps,
then
the
cable
operators
would
be
free
to
look
for
the
more
economical
way
to
do
that.
and
once
again,
it
was
the
government's
witness
that
demonstrated
that
the
traps
could
be
installed
by
the
subscriber.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
we
disagree
with...
with
the
government's
figures
on
that.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
well,
based
on
the
figures
that
we
presented
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
post-trial
stage,
we
suggest
that
the
breakeven
point
would
be
closer
to
80
percent.
but
nothing
approaches
that
in...
in
this
case
because
of
the
phenomenon
of
signal
bleed
being
more
sporadic
than
the
government
suggests.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
that
is
a--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--that...
that's
a
very
big
spread
because
the
government
overestimated
the
cost
of
the
traps
by
three
times.
they
estimated
the
cost
of
having
a
service
call,
which
added
80
percent
to
the
cost,
and
when
you
add
up
all
those
differences,
there
is
a
significantly
wide
spread.
but
even
if
you
accepted
the
government's
figure,
which
is
6
percent,
not
3
percent...
they
tried
to
split
the
difference...
then
you're
talking
about
installing
something
like
3.72
million
traps,
which
based
on
this
record,
is
utterly
implausible.
in
the
16
years
that
playboy
television
has...
has
been
on
the
air,
the
fcc
has
received
33,000
complaints
about
cable
in
general,
and
of
those,
only
72
related
to
indecent
programming.
and
the
government
doesn't
know
how
many
relate
to
signal
bleed.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
it
was
litigated.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
yes,
it
was.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
we
could
never
reach
agreement
on
that
point,
but
the
figures
are
in
the
record--
mr.
robert
corn-revere
--the
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court
was
6
percent,
but
that
was
expressly
based
on
the
assumption
that
you
would
require
a
service
call
and
then
didn't
discuss
the
remaining
factors
that
were
addressed
in
the
briefs.
and
based
on
that
6
percent,
once
again
that
would
amount
to
something
like
3.72
million
traps.
mr.
robert
corn-revere
i
don't
know
if
you'd
call
it
a
finding.
it
seemed
more
offhand
than
that.
but
the
government
did...
i
mean,
the...
the
district
court
did
make
that
assumption
despite
the
evidence
that
was
presented
below
even
by
the
government
that
that
wouldn't
be
required.
ultimately
to
resolve
the
court...
this
case
in
the
government's
favor,
they're
really
asking
this
court
to
make
a
number
of
changes,
significant
changes
in...
in
first
amendment
doctrine.
first,
they're
asking
this
court
to
apply
the
pacifica
precedent
specifically
to
cable
television,
which
this
court,
at
least
in
the
past,
has
declined
to
do.
and
secondly,
they're
asking
for
the
authority
to
restrict
the
speech
available
in
all
households
in
a
cable
community
even
though
they
acknowledge
that
parents
are
fully
able
to
block
the
offensive
speech
in
a
particular
household.
and
third,
they're...
they're
asking
to
significantly
limit
the
doctrine
of
least
restrictive
means
as
it
applies
in
first
amendment
cases.
there's
really
nothing
in
this
court's
prior
decisions...
and
as
the
district
court
found...
that
would
justify
significant
changes
in
the
law.
this
is
particularly
true
with
respect
to
the
notion
of
individual
user
empowerment
and
as
we
look
at
newer
technologies.
if
the
government
were
correct
that
the
complete
ability
of
a
household
to
stop
offensive
speech
coming
into
the
home
is
ineffective
and
is
not
sufficient
to
forestall
the
need
for
government
regulation,
then
it
would
open
a
wide
avenue
for
the
regulation
not
just
of
cable
television,
but
of
other
new
technologies
that
do
empower
individuals
to
take
steps
on
their
own
either
through
market-based
measures
or
through
other
less
restrictive
regulatory
measures
to
address
those
issues.
and
for
that
reason,
it
would
be
a
significant
change
in
the
law.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll--
