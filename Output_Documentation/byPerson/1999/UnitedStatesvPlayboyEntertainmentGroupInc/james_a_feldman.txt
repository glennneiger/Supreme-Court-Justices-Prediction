mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
congress'
attempt
to
address
the
problem
of
graphic
sexually
explicit
adult
programming
that
is
available
on
cable
televisions...
on
cable
television
to
minors
with
merely
the
flip
of
a
dial.
it's
available
to
children
even
though
their
parents
have
not
subscribed
to
the
cable
channels
carrying
the
programming
and
therefore
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they're
not
receiving
that
programming
on
their
televisions.
the
phenomenon
is
known
as
signal
bleed,
and
it
occurs
when
a
cable
operator
scrambles
partially
the
video
portion
of
a
premium
channel
like
that
operated
by
appellee,
but...
and...
but
meanwhile
the
soundtrack
from
that
channel
and
other
portions
of
the
video
programming
are
allowed
to
get
through,
even
to
non-subscribers.
as
a
result,
children
with
access
to
cable
television
gain
access
intentionally
or
accidentally
to
what
the
district
court
termed
the
virtually
100
percent
sexually
explicit
programming.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there's
very
substantial
evidence
of
that.
in
the
first
place...
and
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
approach
that
is
the
district
court
found
that
on
most
cable
television
systems...
and
there's
some
variation,
to
be
sure,
but
on
most
cable
television
systems,
the
audio
portion
of
programming
on
channels
like
those
that
playboy
or
spice
or
spice
hot
operates...
the
audio
portion
goes
through
unhindered.
so,
that...
that's
there
and
that's
a
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
court
has
never
said
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
indecency
on
cable
television,
and
in
fact,
the
court
has
specifically
declined
to
decide
that
question
in
the
past
on
a
number...
several
occasions.
in
our
view,
the
right
answer,
for
the
reasons
given
in
our
brief,
is
not
quite
strict
scrutiny;
that
is,
there
should
be
a
showing
of
a
compelling
interest
because
it
is
a
content-based
regulation.
but
some
deference
should
be
given
in
light
of
the
factors
that
the
court
has
noted
in
pacifica
and
later
cases,
the
pervasiveness
into
the...
in
the
home,
the
harm
to
children.
some
deference
should
be
given
to
congress'
choice
among
alternatives
of...
of
how
to
deal
with
the
problem.
and
especially
that's
true
where
what
the...
the
alternative
that
congress
has
chosen
is
time-channeling
as
one
option,
which
permits
the
cable
operator
to
show
the...
show
the
material
from
10:00
p.m.
to
6:00
a.m.
unhindered
and
with
no
restrictions.
that
is
the...
that's
the
solution
that
the
court
approved
in
pacifica,
and
it's
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
competing
interests.
it
keeps--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
you
have
to
assume
that
it's
indecency.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
because...
i
suppose
because
that's...
that's
what...
insofar
as...
insofar
as
there's
obscenity
that's
being
broadcast
on
cable
television,
it's
already
independently
unlawful
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
really
a...
it
wasn't
a
subject
of
proof
at
trial.
one
reason
is
that
the
obscenity
issue
turns
on
contemporary
community
standards
in
different
communities
across
the
country.
it
also...
and
a
number
of
other
factors
as
well.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--um-hmm.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
those
are...
i
can't...
i
can't
answer
that
question
because
i
can't
say
which
they
are.
they
are
examples
of
what
happens
when
signal
bleed
occurs,
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
a
little
bit.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
it
definitely
varies.
it
varies
from
time
to
time
and
from
place
to
place.
at
the
times
when
those
tapes
were
made,
there's
no
reason
not
to
think
that
the
exact
same
material
is
being
pumped
down
to
all
of
the
other
subscribers
on
those
particular
cable
television--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i...
i
guess
the...
the...
i
don't
think
there's
a
record
made
as
to
whether
there
are
other
channels
that
broadcast
materials
that...
that
wouldn't
be
obscene
under...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it's
channels
primarily
devoted
to
sexually
explicit
programming.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
don't
know
based
on
this
record
whether
there
are
or
not.
but
i
do
think
that
it...
it
is
jumping
to
a
conclusion
that
all
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i...
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is.
but
i
do
know
that
based...
that
based
on
the
record
that...
the
question
of
whether
something
is
obscene,
as
i
said
before,
depends
on
the
local...
on
contemporary
community
standards
of
specific
communities.
that
wasn't
an
issue
that
was
litigated
in
this
case,
and
there
aren't
any
findings
in
this
case
about
it.
and
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
it's
exceptionally
difficult
to
litigate
an
issue
such
as
whether
material
is
obscene
that's
broadcast
on
a
nationwide
channel
because
there
are
standards
that
differ
from
state
to
state
and
the
case
law
and
the
results--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
it
were
all
obscene,
then...
then--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
statute
wouldn't...
wouldn't
have
been
necessary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
i...
i
do
think
that...
well,
i'd
just
go
back
to
what
i
said--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that's
not...
that's
not
historically
what
has
been
done.
what
happened
is
that
there
were...
and
this
goes
back
to
the
exhibits
that
justice
ginsburg
was
talking
about,
is
that...
that
this
material
was
coming
down
the
line
on
cable
channels
to
parents
into
homes
who
had
specifically
chosen
not
to
subscribe
to
it
and
only
found
out
after
their
children
had
viewed
it
that
they
were
seeing
it.
and
the
audio
portions
of
the
programming,
as
i
mentioned,
are
exactly
the
same
kinds
of
audio
material
that
was
at
issue
in...
in
pacifica,
which
only
involved
the
radio,
and
in
sable...
in
sable...
the
sable
case,
which
involved
the
dial-a-porn
regulation
of
telephone
lines.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
how...
how
often
the
children
are
actually
tuning
in
to
it?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
know
how
much
the
children
are
actually
tuning
in
to
it.
there
was...
the
evidence
that
the
district
court
cites
is
that
it's
available
in
39
million
homes
with
29
million
children.
now,
how
often
the
children
actually
watch
it
or
listen
to
it
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
it
does.
that
was
the
figure
that
the
district
court
used.
and
if
you...
the
number
of
parents
who
actually
subscribed
to
this
is
rather
low.
the
district
court
found
that
between
800,000
and
1.6
million
people
subscribe
to
the
playboy
channel
in
a
year.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
has
to...
it
has
to
be
a...
it
has
to
be
a
significant
problem.
in
the
pacifica
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
guess
i...
i
would
want
to
know
whether
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
availability
of
it
in
1...
or
10
homes
or
the
number
of
children
that
are
actually
watching--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
the...
the
only...
well,
the
reason
i
can't
answer
that
is
i
think
the
question
and
the
question
on
which
the
district
court
decided...
well,
the
key
question
here
is
to
compare
the
extent
to
which
there's
a
burden
of
speech
that's
imposed
by
section
505
with
the
evil
that
it's
addressing.
and
so,
you
have
to
look
at
kind
of
both
sides
of
the
equation.
the
evil
that...
that
it's
addressing
is
what
i've
addressed...
talked
about
so
far,
and
that
includes
the
audio
signal
bleed
that
is
very
widespread
at
least
and
video
signal
bleed
that
varies
from
time
to
time
and
place
to
place
but
that
was
the
cause
of
a
lot
of
complaints
and
clearly
does
happen,
as
shown
by
the
tapes--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct,
and
if
you
look
at
the
pacifica
case,
there
was
one
complaint
by...
from
one
parent
that
triggered
the
pacifica
litigation,
and
there
was
no
showing
in
that
record
that
there
was
more
than
one
child
who
listened
to
it.
it's
the...
the
problem
here
is
the
risk
that...
is
that
the
availability
of
this
material
in
people's
homes
who
have
not
subscribed
to
it
and
don't
even
think
that
they're
getting
it.
what
congress
did
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they...
they...
well,
i
suppose
they
could
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the...
what
was...
the
facts
that
were
underlying
congress'
action
are
the
facts
that
were
found
by
the
district
court,
and
they
are
that
there
are
channels
that
broadcast
virtually
100
percent
sexually
explicit
content
and
that
that
content
is
continuously
broadcast.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
that's
true.
but...
that's
true.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't...
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
that
you
can
look
at
the...
at
the...
i
don't
think
appellee
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
statute
based
on
someone
else
who
used
the
most
innocuous
of
the
material
that
would
fall
within
this.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
the
same
material--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
involves...
well,
the
fcc
took
that...
that
definition
and
said
that
one
is
a
subset
of
two,
and
it
defined
them
both
in
the
same
way
that...
the
same
definition
that
it
has
used
in
the
regulation
of
dial-a-porn
on...
on
telephone
lines
which
has
been
upheld
now
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
a
subset.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
determination
of
which
we're
dealing
with.
we're
dealing
with
material
that
is...
that
is
indecent
as
defined
by
the
fcc
with
a
definition
that
is
used
and
has
been
used
for
the
past
20
years
to
control
indecency
on
broadcast
television.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
you
know,
i...
maybe
you
can
assume
that.
maybe
you
can
assume
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
has
to
be
a
channel...
it
only
applies
to
channels
that
are
primarily
devoted
to...
to
that
kind
of
programming.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
that's
correct.
it
applies
only
to
channels
that
are
primarily
devoted.
so,
that's
a...
if
a
channel
broadcast
24
hours
a
day
the
kinds
of
words
that
were
at
issue
in
pacifica,
then
that
would
be
covered
by
the...
that
would
surely
be
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
but
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
can
deposit
the
whole
range
of
different
kinds
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
probably
prefer
not
to.
the
fcc
gave
a
definition...
gave
a
definition
which
is
as
a
whole,
if
you
take
both
halves,
it
refers
to
the...
it
refers
to
any
programming
that
describes
or
depicts
sexual
or
excretory
activities
or
organs
in
a
patently
offensive
manner
as
measured
by
contemporary
community
standards
for
the
cable
medium,
which
is
the
same
definition
that
governs
indecency
on
broadcast
television.
it's
the
same
definition
that
governs
indecency
on
dial-a-porn.
it
has
done
that
for
the
last
10
years
or
more,
20
years
on
broadcast
television,
since
the
time
of
pacifica.
and
if
there's
something
wrong
with
the
statute
that
regulates
that
material,
then
all
of
that
regulation
would
have
to
fall.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they
don't...
they
don't
specifically
describe
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
they
don't.
i...
it
has
never
been
disputed,
and
if
you
look
at--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
you
know,
i
would
prefer
if
the
district
court
had,
but
the
tapes
are
in
the
record.
it's
certainly
never
been
disputed.
if
you
look
at
playboy's
own
programming
content
guidelines
or
those
of
spice,
they
say
we
use
strong
language.
strong
language
is
something
that
we
use.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
you
might
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
if...
if...
again,
the...
the
record
is
full
of
tapes
of...
for
instance,
there
were
tapes
of
material
that
was
broadcast
on...
on
spice
and
on
playboy
on
certain,
specific,
randomly
selected
days.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
well...
well,
the...
the
court...
the
only
other
choice
i
think
would
be
to
remand
it
if...
to
the
district
court
for
it.
but
i
will
say
that
i
don't
think
it's
disputed
among
the
parties
that
the
sound
tracks
on
these
tapes
are
the
same
kinds
of
sound
tracks
that
were...
it's
the
same
kind
of
indecent
audio
material
that
was
at
issue
in
the
dial-a-porn
cases
and
at
issue
in
pacifica.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
actually
much...
it's
the
same...
some
of
it
is
the
same
language.
actually
it's
repeated
in
terms
that
are
much
coarser
and
that
are
in
the
context
of
people
actually
engaging
in
the
activities
that
are
described.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
and
there's...
i
think
there
are
two
problems
as...
as
we've...
as
we've
discussed
in
our
briefs.
there
are
two
problems
with
the
district
court...
two
reasons
why
the
district
court
was
just
wrong
about
that.
the
first
is
it's
not
just
a
question
of
each
individual
parent
being
able
to
decide
for
his
or
her
own
children.
there's
a
social
interest
in
the
upbringing
of
children,
society's
interest,
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized.
now,
acting
on
that
interest,
congress
has
decided
that
this
material
is
harmful
for
children
and
shouldn't
be
shown
to
children
unless
the
parents
consent
and
that
parental
consent
cannot
be
inferred
simply
from
a
parent's
failure
to
act
under
a
provision
like
504.
now,
that's
very
common
in
our
society
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
are
some
analogies
to
the
situation
to...
to
a
law
like
that
about
violence.
i
mean,
one
difference
is
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
this
material
is
harmful
to
children
and
that
our
society
has
an
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
children
don't
get
it.
but
i...
i
think
it's
important
that
what
congress
decided
is
not
that
children
can't
get
this.
what
congress
decided
is
that
it's
harmful
to
children
and
they
shouldn't
get
it
unless
their
parents
consent.
and
it's
not
uncommon
in
our
society
that
children
don't
get
things
unless
their
parents
consent,
and
ordinarily
that
requires
affirmative
consent
by
the
parent,
not
really
the
parent's
failure
to
act.
and
it's
particularly--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's...
i
think
it's
more
complex
than
just
to
say
a
parent
who
says
it.
there
are
certainly
parents
who
will
say
that.
but
they've
said
that
after
subscribing
to
the
cable
channel
and
making
an
affirmative
decision
that
i
don't
want
these
channels.
i
know
i
can
pay
more
for
them
and
get
them.
i
don't
want
them.
and
therefore,
they
have
every
reason
to
think...
and
these
are
the
complaints
and
the
record
show
this...
these
parents
have
every
reason
to
think
that
they're
not
getting
this
material.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
they
find
their
children--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
that
actually
gets
to
the
other
half
of
the
argument,
and
it's
the...
the
reason
why
congress
acted
is
because
a
scheme
like
the
district
court
envisioned
can't
work
and
it
can't
work
for
three
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
the
kind
of
notice
that
would
have
to
be
given
would
have
to
be...
it's
very
doubtful
that
really
effective
notice
that
permits
a
genuinely
informed
and
effective
choice
to
be
made
would
be
even
plausible
to
be
given--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
let
me
explain
why.
for
two
reasons.
one
reason
is
you're
operating
against...
in
a
situation
where
the
cable
operator
has
a
financial
incentive
not
to
give
the
notice
both
because
giving
the
notice
is
expensive.
if
the
parent
chooses
to
elect
blocking,
that's
a
further
cost.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
has
to
be...
right.
secondly,
you're
operating
against
a
system
where
the
parent
already
thinks
that
he's
not
getting
it
and
it
requires
an
exceptional
amount
of
notice
and
effective
notice
in
order
to
take
a
parent
who
thinks
he's
not
getting
it
and
convince
him
that
he
is
getting
it,
and
therefore
he
has
to
act
once
again
and
do
something.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
you
have
to
sketch
out
exactly
what
would
be
said
and
how
it
could
be
said
in
such
a
way
to
counteract
the
two
things
i
just
mentioned.
but
then
you
get
to
the
next
problem
which
is
that
itself
is
going
to
be
expensive.
if
it
has
to
be
done
on
bill
inserts,
on
advertisements
on
other
channels,
on
all
the
means
that
the
district
court
said,
and
they
would
have
to
be
specified
very,
very
particularly.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
the
channel
here
is
or
the
other
channels
are
willing
to
do
it.
they...
they--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
because
they...
it
hasn't
been
spelled
out
for
them
exactly
what
kind
of
a
notice
is
required
and
what
would...
what
effective--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
would
suggest
that
they've
calculated
something
different
which
is
that
the
minimum
amount
that
they
could
do
that
was
consistent
with
the
vague
guidelines
that
the
district
court
gave
would
be
something
that
they
could
do
that
wouldn't
have
much
effect
on
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
because
i
don't
really...
i
guess
i
don't
really
think
they've
made
the
calculation.
that's
not
a
position
that
they
took
at
trial
in
this
case
in
front
of
the
district
court.
let's
have
a
lot
of
notice.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
we'll
explain
to
you
what
we'll
do.
and
i
just
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
now
have
a
choice
of
either
having
this
statute
struck
down
and
therefore
it
being
open
season
or
saying,
yes,
we'll
abide
by
some
kind
of
vague
notice...
notice
if
anybody
can
ever
figure
out
what
it
would
be.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
it's
not
an...
i
guess
i
don't
think
it's
an
odd
argument
to
make
when
it's
in
the
context
of...
of
a
case
where
they're
trying
to
get
out
from
under
a
statute
and
where
they're
not
genuinely
faced
with
a
particular
regulatory
program.
in
fact,
i...
i
would
guess
that
if
congress
really
enacted
a
statute
that
detailed
in
the
precise
terms
that
would
be
necessary
how...
what
kind
of
a
notice
would
be
given
and
how
that
would
work,
and
once
they
saw
that,
first
of
all,
it
would
be
very
expensive
for
cable
operators
to
provide
the
notice,
and
secondly,
it
would
lead
to
an
enormous
number
of
people
who,
if
they
really
knew
about
the
problem
and
haven't
subscribed
to
this
have...
have
no
reason
to
want
it,
they
would
just
say,
no,
i
don't
want
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
i...
i
think...
you
know,
i
think
that
that
partly
goes
back
to
congress
having
looked
at
the
situation
and
said
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
a
system
like
section
504
can't
work,
starting
with
the
fact
that
these
are
parents
who
have
already
decided
they
don't
want
these
channels,
and
only
then
they
find
that
they're
getting
them
anyway.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
for
some
it
may
be.
let
me
just...
let
me
just
also
say
that
the
district
court's
own
findings
are
that...
with
a
very,
very
small
number
of
people
requested
blocking
under
section
504
or
under
a
section
like
504...
under
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court,
it
would
be
uneconomical
for
cable
operators
to
carry
appellee's
programming,
and
they
would
drop
it
altogether,
which
would
be
a
restriction
on
speech
greater
than
that
that
results
from
505.
that
operates
from
the
same
effect
of
market
forces
that
505
operates.
if
more
people
subscribed
to...
to
appellee's
programming,
then
the
market...
market
would
mean
that
it
would
be...
that
it
would
be...
that
maybe
stations
wouldn't
have
to
move
to
time-channeling
or
they
might
be
able...
well,
it
would
mean
that
they
would
mean
that
they
would
got
out
and
get
the
equipment
that
was
necessary
to
block
it
and
provide
it
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
but
it
was
amendment
to
the
same
bill
that
contained
section
504,
and
what
we
do
know
about
it,
it
was
specifically
addressed
to
the
fact
that
there
was
this
504
alternative
out
there,
and
senator
feinstein
specifically
said,
we
should
put
the
burden
not
on
the
parent,
having
already
not
subscribed
to
these
channels
to
now
say
again,
i
don't
want
them,
but
to
put
it
on
the
cable
company
to
say,
if
you
want
to
transmit
these...
this
material,
people
should
affirmatively
request
it.
you
know,
i'd
add
that
under
the
district
court's
findings,
it
would
take
a...
an
extremely
small
number
of
parents
to
request
blocking
to
make
the
whole
scheme
uneconomical,
something
like
1
or
2
percent.
the
district
court
found
3
percent
would...
to
6
percent
would
completely
exhaust
all
the
revenues
that
the
cable
operators
get
from
appellee's
programming.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
that
might
be
the
answer,
but
i
think
they
would
be
in
here
with
the
same
kind
of
argument
they're
making
now,
which
is
this
is...
this
is...
this
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it's
content-based,
which
it
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
they
would
be
saying
this
is
content-based,
which
it
would
be,
and
it
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it's
leading
these
cable
operators
to
completely
drop
our
programming.
actually
section
505,
when
congress
adopted
the
time-channeling
option,
it's
the
same
option
that's
been
used
in
broadcast
television.
that
was
a
reasonable
choice,
and
in
fact
it
was
the
only
effective
way
of
achieving
the
compelling
interests
at
stake.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
i
just...
i
wanted
to
point...
direct
the
court's
attention...
the
factual
findings...
the
facts
on
the
issues
that
mr.
corn-revere
were
talking...
was
talking
about...
there
was
disagreement
between
the
government
and
playboy
on
them,
and
the
district
court
found
in
our
favor.
the
3
percent
and
6
percent
figures
are
what
the
district
court...
this
is
on
page
22a
of
the
js
appendix.
the
district
court
found
that
those
are
the
figures,
depending
on
how
long
you
allow
the
cable
operator
to
recover
its
cost.
those
are
the
figures
that
would
totally
exhaust
the
revenues,
that
if
3
to
6
percent
of
the
subscribers
requested
blocking,
the
revenues
that
the
cable
operator
got
from
playboy.
the
district
court
then
found
that,
in
fact,
cable
operators
would
drop
playboy
before
it
exhausted
all
the
revenues,
but
when
it
just
was
no
longer
making
enough
profit.
that's
on
22a.
the
district
court
also
in
footnote
21
on
that
same
page
said,
playboy's
contention
that
negative
traps
can
be
mailed
to
subscribers,
thereby
obviating
the
need
for
installation
labor
costs
and
lowering
the
cost
of
mechanism...
per
mechanism,
is
unavailing.
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
district
court
thought
that
playboy
was
wrong
on
that.
i'd
just
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
congress
adopted
here
a
time-channeling
alternative
that
permits...
permits
the
material
to
be
shown
from
10:00
p.m.
to
6:00
a.m.
when
most
of
the
audience
for
the
material
is
there.
the
people
who...
people
have...
given
the
virtually
universal
presence
of
video
cassette
recorders
in
homes,
people
who
want
to
watch
it
at
other
times
can
watch
it.
but
it
imposes
the
least
risk
to
children.
that
was
a...
more
than
a
reasonable...
that
was
the
only
effective
solution
to
the
problem
that
congress
saw.
and
there...
playboy
hasn't
suggested
any
reason
why
congress'
determination
that
that
test,
10:00
p.m.
to
6:00
a.m.
safe
harbor
which
governs
the
same
kind
of
problem
on
broadcast
television,
shouldn't
be
equally
applicable
and
equally
effective
here.
