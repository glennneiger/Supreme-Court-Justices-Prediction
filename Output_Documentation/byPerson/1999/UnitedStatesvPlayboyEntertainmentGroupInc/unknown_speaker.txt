unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
of
actual
signal
bleed
as
opposed
to
the
potential
for
it?
i
mean,
what...
what
does
the
record
show?
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
what
level
of
scrutiny
do
you
think
our
precedents
dictate...
govern
our
analysis
here
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we've
said
that
cable
television
and
the
internet
are
entitled
to
strict
scrutiny?
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
do...
do
i
have
to...
do
i
have
to
assume,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
just
what
you
call
indecency
and
not
obscenity?
i
mean,
i've
read
some
of
the
footnotes
in...
in
your
brief
that
describe...
describe
these
matters.
my
law
clerks
have
looked
at
the
videos
that
were
lodged,
and
i
wouldn't
even
read
the
descriptions
in...
in
public.
it
seems
to
me
obscenity.
unknown
speaker
why
do
i
have
to
assume
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
can
have...
you
can
have
more
than
one
means
of...
of
preventing
that
evil,
it
seems
to
me.
there's
no
factual
finding
of
the
court
below
that
this
was
not
obscenity,
is
there?
and
even
if
there
were,
i
just
can't...
can't
imagine
that
what
you
describe
in
your
brief
doesn't
qualify
as
obscenity.
the
government
didn't
charge
that
it
was
obscene.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
care
what
community
you're
in.
the
things
described
here
and
lodged
with
the
court
strike
me
as
obscene.
unknown
speaker
on
that
score,
mr.
feldman,
you...
in
your
brief
you
urge
particularly
that
we
look
at
exhibits
1,
2,
and
44.
unknown
speaker
are
those
typical
or
are
those
the
worst
cases?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
for
example,
one
of
them,
2,
is
not
as
graphic
as
1.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i...
i
can
imagine
a
cable
channel
advertising
itself
as
we...
you
know,
we
transmit
indecent
programming.
that's
going
to
get
a
lot
of
viewers
i
suppose
as
opposed
to,
quote,
sexually
explicit
programming.
i
had
thought
that
the
answer
to
my
question
you
were
going
to
give
was
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge
and
that
even
if
these
particular
productions
are
obscene
and
if
this
whole
channel
can
be
characterized
as
obscene,
you...
you
have
to
consider
the
application
of
this
statute
to
other
channels
that...
that
qualify
as,
quote,
sexually
explicit
channels
that
are
not
obscene.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
would
be
a
good
answer
if
there
existed
any
such
channels.
are
you
sure
that
there
exist
any
such
channels?
in
a
facial
challenge,
do
we
have
to
imagine
factual
situations
that
we
know
do
not
exist
out
in
the
real
world?
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
statute
cover
in...
in
its
terms?
what...
what
channels
are...
are
subject
to
this...
this
law?
unknown
speaker
right.
now,
do
you
think
there
are
out
there
in
the
real
world
channels
primarily
devoted
to
sexually
explicit
program
that
do
not...
do
not
contain
obscene
transmissions
in
large
part?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a...
i
have
a
very
deep
suspicion
what
the
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
should
have
been.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
should
have
been.
maybe
we
cannot
answer
the...
the
facial
challenge
question
without
inquiries
into
those
questions,
including
inquiries
into...
into
whether
there
are
any,
quote,
sexually
explicit
channels
that
do
not
regularly
contain
material
that
is
obscene
by
anybody's
community
standards.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
wouldn't
that
be
the...
wouldn't
that
be
the
prosecutor's
choice?
i
mean,
a
court...
could
a
court
say,
if
the
government
chooses
not
to
characterize
something
as
obscene,
i
don't
care
what
the
prosecutor
or
the
government's
attorney
chooses
to
bring
to
this
court,
i'm
going
to
make
the
case
and
insist
that
the
government
makes
the
case
that
it's
obscene?
i...
i
didn't
know
that
a
court
had
that
authority.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
feldman?
if
justice
scalia
is
right,
that
all
this
stuff
is
obscene,
you
didn't
really
need
the
statute,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
is
a
nullity.
it's
just
superfluous.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me--
unknown
speaker
--you'd
prosecute
each
one
of
these
movies
one
by
one.
is...
is
that
right?
and
that's...
that's
how
you
would
protect
the
little
children.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
i...
i'm
sure
everybody
would
agree
that
this
happens
in
some
instances.
does
the
record,
however,
give
us
any
basis
for
determining
the
extent
to
which
it
is
happening,
i.e.,
the
extent
to
which
in
non-subscriber
homes
the
bleed
is
being
observed
by
the
children...
by
children?
i'm
sure
there
are
some.
everybody
agrees--
unknown
speaker
--how
much...
how
much
of
it
is
being--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
include
the...
the
homes
of
the
parents
that
subscribe
to
these
channels?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
think
the
figures
you
cite
show
there
there's
a
substantial
problem.
can
you
tell
me
what
is
the
standard
for
how
widespread
the
bleed
must
be?
i
think
it's
widespread
here
based
on
what
you
said.
what
is
the
legal
standard?
if
this
happened
in
1
community
to
10
homes,
would
it
justify
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--significant
problem
nationwide?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
fairly
much
of
an
academic
point
based
on
your
figures,
but
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
the...
what
the
standard
was
to
the
extent
of
the
evil.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
in
our
kiddie
pornography
cases,
ferber
against
new
york,
we
did
not
require
any
very
comprehensive
showing
of
how
many
children
were
engaged
in
it.
a
few
was
too
many.
unknown
speaker
what
material?
i
mean,
all
we
know,
if
you're
going
to
defend
this
statute
facially
without...
without
making
a
determination
that
all
of
these
channels,
as
far
as
we
know,
are...
are
carrying
obscenity,
they
can
just
be
dirty
words.
right?
they
can
just
be,
you
know,
blue
language.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of...
really
what
congress
was
after
was
channels
that
use
some...
some
naughty
words
that
shouldn't
be
used,
indecency
and
not...
not
obscenity.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
congress
addressed
in...
in
using
the
word
indecency,
which
is...
which
is
defined
very
broadly.
it
covers
many
other
things.
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
the
facial
challenge,
we
have
to
assume
the
existence
of...
of
a
person
who
uses
the
most
innocuous
of...
of
those
programmings.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's...
i
thought
that's
what
a
facial
challenge
was,
that
if...
if
you
could
show
that
this
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
anybody,
you
can...
you
can
plead
that
person's
defense.
isn't--
--is...
is
this...
i
read
this
provision.
it
says
in
providing
sexually
explicit
adult
programming.
that's
one.
or
two,
other
programming
that
is
indecent.
i
thought
this
case
involved
one
not
two.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
a
subset.
unknown
speaker
is
it
still
that
we're
dealing
with
one?
unknown
speaker
and
so
for
purposes
of
the
facial
challenge,
we
must
assume
anybody--
unknown
speaker
--who
does
anything
which
is
indecent.
unknown
speaker
we
must--
unknown
speaker
--well,
to
indecent
programming.
unknown
speaker
we
have
to
deposit
in
our
minds
a
dirty
word
channel.
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
the...
if
the
sentence
actually
is
broken
down,
in
providing
sexually
explicit
adult
programming
or
other
programming
that
is
indecent.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
someone
who
is
providing
sexually
explicit
programming
can
challenge
it
on
the
basis
of...
of
the
other
part
of
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
reason
why
you
should
try
to
resolve
all
these
nuances.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
pacifica?
because
you've
mentioned
it
so
often.
do
the
findings
describe
the
aural
content,
the
sound
content,
as
opposed
to
what
you
see
because
of
the
bleed?
i
didn't...
i
missed
that
part
of
it
when
i--
unknown
speaker
--they
don't
tell
us
what...
what
words
are
heard
over
the...
this--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
a
big
part
of
your
argument.
it's
not
even
mentioned
by
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
see
an
awful
lot
of
strong
language
on...
on
wgn
or
whatever
the
best
channels
are.
i'm
very
often
shocked
at
what
i
see
on
television.
and
i
just
wonder--
unknown
speaker
--if
strong
language
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
so,
we
should
have
to
make
our
own
findings
about
what
the
aural
content
is
by
ourselves
looking
at
these
tapes.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
particularly
anxious
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman--
--well,
much
of
the
language
in
pacifica
you
can
hear
on
television
any
night
of
the
week
on
any
channel.
unknown
speaker
but
what
of
the
argument
that
unlike
pacifica
where
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
parent
who
just
switched
on
the
signal
to
control
it?
here
the
answer,
in
the
next
part
of
the
statute
that
was
persuasive
to
the
district
court,
any
parent
who
wants
to
stop
this
can
for
the...
not
even
the
price
of
a
telephone
call,
a
free
telephone
call.
unknown
speaker
the
idea
that
the
government
is
a
kind
of
a
super
parent.
would
you
take
the
same
view
if
congress
did
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
violence
on
television?
i
was
struck
looking
at
some
of
the
european
union
countries.
they
put
violence
first
on
what
the
children
can't
see
and
then
pornography
comes
after
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why
should
it,
though?
i
mean,
if...
if
the...
if
the
public
interest,
as
you
describe,
yields
to
a
parent's
decision
to
subscribe
to
the
channel
so
that
the
children
can
see
it...
presumably
can
see
it
unscrambled,
why
doesn't
the
public
interest
also
yield
when
a
parent,
in
effect,
says
i
don't
care
whether
my
kids
get
to
see
this
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
on
the
district
court's--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
district
court's
proposal
is
that
the
parents
will
be
advised
in...
in
connection
with,
i
guess
it's
section
504,
that
in
fact
this
kind
of
bleed
goes
on
and
in
fact
they...
they
can
block
it
absolutely--
unknown
speaker
--if
they
want
to
call
for
a
blocking
device.
so
that
on
the
district
court's
analysis,
the...
let's
say
the...
the
totally
ignorant,
indifferent
parent
is...
is
going
to
be,
for
practical
purposes,
eliminated,
and
on
that
assumption,
why
doesn't
the
public
interest
yield
to
the
parents'
decision
in
the
face
of
that
choice
just
as
the...
just
as
the...
as
the
public
responsibility
somehow
yields
to
the
parents'
affirmative
choice
to
subscribe?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
the
government
presumably
can
tell
them
to
give
the
notice
and
tell
them
what
notice
to
give.
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
understand
that.
if
the
cable
operator
provides
a
notice
saying
you
are
getting
this.
if
your
children
turn
into
channel
x,
they're
going
to
get
certain...
a
certain
signal
bleed.
why
is
that
difficult
to
convey
to
parents?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
broadcasters
accept
that.
yes.
i
would
accept
your
argument
there
perhaps
if...
if
the
channel
here
weren't
quite
willing
to...
to
do
what
the
district
court
had
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
they're
certainly
willing
for
purposes
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we're
talking
now
about
the...
about
the
expense
and...
and
the
effect
of
the
expense.
and
i
presume
they
can
calculate
the...
the
expense
and
they've
calculated
it
and
they
don't
think
that
that
is
tantamount
to
equal
or...
or
more
severe
regulation.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
assume
they've
made
their
mistake.
why
isn't
that
their
problem?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
why...
why...
if
they've
made
a
mistake
in
calculation,
why
should
we
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
saving
them
from
that
mistake?
unknown
speaker
well,
let...
let's
assume--
unknown
speaker
--well,
for
purposes
of
developing
the...
let's
just
assume
that
in
the
district
court,
they
said,
we're
not
concerned
about
the
cost.
we'll...
we'll
take
the
risk
that
we're
going
to
get
cancellations
because
local
channels
are
going
to
find
that
this
is
too...
we'll
take
that
risk.
we
don't
care.
could
the
government
come
forward...
come
back
and
say,
oh,
well,
this
might
be
more
expensive
than
you
think?
that...
that
sounds
like
an
odd
argument
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
your
guessing
and...
and
the
burden
is
on...
is
on
you
to
sustain
the
legislation.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
as
to
that,
i
think
it
may
be
a
cost
consideration.
you
get
the
cheapest
channel
and
then
you
hope
to
get
the
sports
on
the
bleed,
you
know?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
you
spoke
of
what
congress
had
contemplated.
am
i
right
that
in
fact
the
provision
in
question
here
was...
was
offered
as
an
amendment
on
which
there
was
never
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
that
happened
and
then
they
started
complaining,
the
answer
would
be,
you
asked
for
it,
you
got
it.
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
a
different
argument
from
the
one
you're
making
now.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
corn-revere,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
find
that
this
was
protected
speech?
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
i
didn't
discover
that
in...
in
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
where
did
it
find
that
what
is
involved
here
is
only
indecency
and
not
pornography?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
this
applies
only
to
channels
that
are
exclusively
devoted
to
sexually
explicit
programming.
what--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
primarily
dedicated
to
sexually
oriented
programming.
are...
are
there,
to
you...
your
knowledge...
i
have
no
problem
with...
with
saying
that
since
the
government
didn't
raise
the
obscenity
point,
it
cannot
come
down
on
this
particular
cable
operator
for
obscenity.
but
i
am
troubled
by
the
fact
that
simply
by
choosing
not
to
raise
the
obscenity
point,
the
government
allows
a
facial
challenge
to
eliminate
this
entire
statute
as
applied
to
all...
all
channels
that...
that
are
devoted
to
primarily
to,
quote,
sexually
oriented
programming.
do
you
know
whether
there
are
channels
devoted
primarily
to
sexually
oriented
programming
that
do
not
contain
material
of
this
sort
that's
described
in
the
government's
brief?
unknown
speaker
do
you...
was
this
case
presented
just
as
a
facial
challenge?
unknown
speaker
if
there
exist
any
such
channels.
and
i...
i'm
not
prepared
to...
to
believe
that
there
are.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
matter
that...
for
purposes
of
a
facial
challenge,
it
seems
to
me
we
don't
imagine
things
that
don't
exist.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
unless
there
are
some
findings
that,
indeed,
there
are
channels
that...
that
just
engage
in...
in
innocuous
indecency,
i...
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
the
whole
statute
is
bad.
unknown
speaker
there's
some
of
that,
but
is...
is
there
nothing
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
ask
for
a
clarification
on
what
the
overall
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme
entails?
is
there
any
prohibition
currently
on
showing
indecent
speech
on
the
ordinary
cable
channels
that
are
not...
that
don't
require
subscription
during
certain
hours?
unknown
speaker
or
regulations?
so,
it...
is
it
entirely
open,
as
far
as
you
know,
for
ordinary
cable
channels
to
carry
indecent
speech
in
the
early
evening
hours
today?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
the
case
is
about,
the
less...
i
mean,
can
i
get
over
the
first
problems
by
simply
assuming...
is
this
a
fair
assumption?
this
deal...
this
case
deals
with
channels
that
are
primarily
oriented
to
sexually...
to
sexually
oriented
programming,
that
that
means
in
this
context
channels
that
have
sexually
explicit
adult
programming,
and
that
in
this
context
that
means
that
programming
which
is,
among
other
things...
depicts
sexual
or
excretory
activities
in
a
patently
offensive
manner?
now,
you...
you...
if
i'm
right,
this
is
not
concerning
seven
words
on
some
other
channel.
this
is
a
channel
dedicated
to
explicit
adult
programming
where
that
means
patently
offensive
depiction
of
sexual
activity.
right?
now,
you
may
have
all
the
standing
to
raise
anybody
who
fits
that
description,
but
is
it
fair
to
say
you
do
not
attack
the
statute,
and
i
don't
have
to
consider
the
statute,
insofar
as
it
is
applied
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
must
be
adult
explicit
material,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
channel
that
wouldn't
fit
within
the
definition
as
i
described
it,
though
you
could
argue
about
whether
or
not
it
is
patently
offensive.
but
i
have
to
assume
for
this
case
that
it
is,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
i
have
to
decide
selfishly
on
this
appeal.
[laughter]
that
is,
in...
in
this
case
can
i...
can
i
make
the
assumptions
that
i
made
and
say,
okay,
now
we're
going
to
go
on
to
the
basic
issue,
which
i
thought
was
the
basic
issue,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
means
is
an
appropriate
means
under
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
corn-revere,
on
page
42a
of
the
appendix
where
the
court
is
giving
its
opinion
in
this
case,
it
says,
plaintiffs
conceded
that
their
programming
is
essentially
100
percent
sexually
oriented
in
contrast
to
the
other
entertainment
channels
that
display
only
occasional
or
sporadically...
sporadic
sexually
explicit
scenes
or
programs.
that
tends
to,
i
think,
answer
justice--
and
it
also
suggests
that
this
was
not
a...
a
facial
challenge.
i
mean,
if...
if
it
was
a
facial
challenge,
i
wonder
why
the
court
is
saying
that
these
particular
plaintiffs...
what
they've
done.
unknown
speaker
can
we
talk
about
the
government's
arguments
with
reference
to
504?
i...
i
have
some
trouble,
as
indicated
by
questions
from
me
and
justice
souter,
with
the
government
saying,
oh,
this
is
going
to
be
too
expensive
for
you
and
the
broadcaster
seemed
to
accept
it.
the
other
point,
though,
it
seems
to
me
the
government
makes
is...
is
troublesome
for
you,
and
that
is
that
many
parents
are
just
not
going
to
know
about
this,
they're
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that
a
little,
and
you...
and
perhaps
you
should
tell
me
if
you
think
that's
something
that
i
can
just
assume
or
if
i
need
findings
of
fact
on
that.
i
mean,
i
think
i
pretty
well
know
that
it's
a
fact,
but
maybe
you
think
that's
out
of
the
ability
of
the
judges
to
know.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
think
we
can't
know
that
there
are...
are
parents
who
are
so
busy
working
and
making
a
living
that
they
don't
have
adequate
time
to
supervise
their
children,
they
don't
care
about
this
sort
of
thing?
and
the
government
is
very
concerned
about
it.
unknown
speaker
can't
i
make
that
assumption?
don't
i
know
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
whether
you
think
the
government...
the
congress
could
prohibit
broadcasting
on
ordinary
channels
patently
offensive
sexual
material
during
early
evening
hours.
can
it
do
that--
unknown
speaker
--without
violating
the
first
amendment
in
order
to
protect
children?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that's
made
here
that
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
indifferent
parents,
the
district
court
was
really
being
utopian
in
thinking
that
on...
on
the
section
504
modification
it
proposed,
that
effective
notice
could
be
given
to
parents
that
would
get
their
attention
and
explain
to
them
that
bleed
was
possible
and
make
it
clear
to
them
that
they
really
did
have
an
option
to...
to
block
it
entirely?
the
government,
in
effect,
is
saying
that
the
district
court
came
up
with
a
scheme
that
in
the
real
world
wouldn't
work.
now,
that's...
that's
quite
apart
from
its...
its
concern
about
the
cost
to
you.
what
is
your
response
to
the
utopianism
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
want
to
know
more
than...
that
the
fact
that
we
might
try
it?
i
mean,
shouldn't...
when...
when
we...
when
we
say
that
this
is
bad
because
there
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative,
i
mean,
i
think
we've...
we've
got
to
make
the
assumption
or...
or
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
less
restrictive
alternative
is
a
real
alternative.
and...
and
that's
why
i'm
interested
in
this
utopianism
argument.
do
you
think...
do
you
think
it's
non-utopian?
may
we
conclude
that,
in
fact,
this
argument
on
the
government's
part
is...
is
unsound?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
we're
really
getting
to
the...
what
i
intend
to
be
the
heart
of
the
question.
do
you
believe
that
you
can
give
effective
notice
or
that
the...
the
cable
operators
can
give
effective
notice
if
they
are
required
to
do...
to
do
so
under...
under
a
504
scheme,
as...
as
envisioned
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
what
would
such
a
notice
consist
of?
if
you
were
writing
the
notice,
what
would
it
say?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would...
let's
assume
it
were
a
written
notice
that
went
with
the
bills.
what
would
it
say?
unknown
speaker
now,
of
course,
your...
your
argument
in...
in
your
brief
to
the
effect
that
it
would
not
be
disastrously
expensive
is
that
there
would
not
be
that
much
response
to
it,
not
that
many
people
would
want
to
block.
and
i
suppose
the
government
might
say
in
response
to
that,
well,
that
simply
shows
that
the...
the
notice
in
fact
is
not
effective
because
if
it
were
effective,
more
people
would
want
to
block.
how
would
we
resolve
that...
that
conundrum?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
it's
a
burden
of
proof
issue.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
on
the
market,
you
mean
for
sale?
unknown
speaker
rather
than
what's
actually
out
there
in
the
homes.
unknown
speaker
the
government's
figures
as
to
the
number
of
houses
in
which
presumably
signal
bleed
occurs
and
the
number
of
children
in
those
houses...
should
we
assume
that
the
figure
of
the
number
of
children
did
not
reflect
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
availability
of
these
other
blocking
devices
that
you're...
you're
considering?
unknown
speaker
so,
that's...
that's
the
maximum
possible
figure.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
i'm
not...
does
the
record
tell
us...
i
understand
that
this
bleed
is
not
always
the
same.
some
bleed
you
can
hardly
see
anything
and
some
bleed
you
can
really...
it's
just
as
though
you're
watching
the
original
version.
does
the
record
tell
us
how...
what
proportion
is
is
what
and
how
pervasive
the...
the
really
clear
reception
is
when
there's
a
bleed?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
lots
of
tapes
put
in.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
about
1,
2,
and
44
because
those
are
graphic,
particularly
1
and
44.
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
off
that
question,
i...
is
the
thesis
that
little
kids
aren't
going
to
watch
this
unless
it's
really
good
reception?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
it
makes
very
much
difference
how
clear
the
picture
coming
through
is.
you
really
think
that's
crucial?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
can't
understand
what's
going
on
because
the
thing
is
so
clouded,
it's
not
all
that
dangerous.
[laughter]
well,
they...
they
mean
by
bleed
more
than...
more
than
that...
that
you
see
something
that's
not
visible,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
see
much
of
anything.
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
video
rather
than
audio?
unknown
speaker
the
basic
difference
between
the
broad
and
the
tailored
is
not
broad
versus
tailored.
it's
opt
in
versus
opt
out,
and
this
is
different
from
denver
because
denver
was
taking
a
lot
of
programs
on
a
lot
of
different
channels
and
forcing
them
to
segregate.
here
we're
dealing
with
material
that
is
segregated.
so,
as
i
see
it,
it's
the
narrow
question:
opt
in
versus
opt
out.
and
i'd
appreciate
your
answer
if
that's
right,
really
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
and
focus
explicitly.
unlike
the
world
where
i
grew
up,
i
think
many,
many
thousands
of
children
come
home
after
school
and
there's
no
one
there
and
parents
don't
want
to
say
i'll
call
up
the
program
and
do
something
because
that
means
they
lose
an
afternoon
at
work
while...
while
they're
home
while
somebody
comes
out
to
the
house,
if
they've
understood
it,
and
then
he
didn't
show
up
on
time.
i
mean,
we've
all
lived
through
having
to
stay
home
all
day
because
the
repairman
didn't
come,
and
he
still
doesn't
come.
so,
they're
saying
that
world
is
the
world
we
live
in.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
have
proof
of
that.
and
in
that
world
opt
in
versus
opt
out
makes
an
enormous
difference.
and
you
say
you're
going
to
segregate.
fine.
segregate,
segregate.
just
don't
give
it
to
people
who
don't
want
it.
that's
all.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
don't
force
them
to
opt
in...
rather
opt
out,
or
we
get
into
the
repairman
problem,
plus
the
fact
we
don't
know,
plus
the
fact
my
kid
is
at
somebody
else's
house,
and
i
trust
my
neighbors,
but
they're
not
so
activist
as
me.
all
right?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
want
you...
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
pressure
for
saying
it
makes
a
big
difference
opt
in
versus
opt
out,
and
i'd
like
to
get
your
response.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
addition
to
making
the
call,
does
something
have
to
be
done
to
the
television
set?
unknown
speaker
but
in
many
cases
it
would
require
someone
to
come
and
do
something
to
the
television
set.
unknown
speaker
what
does
playboy
do
if
somebody
calls
up
and
says,
i
want...
i'm
getting
this
on
channel
2,
you
know,
the
educational
channel?
i
don't
want
it.
okay,
it's
bleeding.
what
does
playboy
do?
do
they
send
somebody
to
the
house
or
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
no.
all
right,
whatever.
unknown
speaker
you're
clients.
let's
say...
you
have
clients,
i
take
it.
they're
involved
in
the
signal
bleed.
i
call
up
tomorrow
and
say
it's
bleeding.
what
do
they
do?
do
they
send
somebody
to
the
house
or
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
to
send
someone
to
the
house.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
it
the
case
that
if
more
than
3
percent
wanted
to
do
it,
then
it
wouldn't
be
economical
at
all
and
you'd
prefer
this
system?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what
percent
would
it
be
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
pretty
big
spread.
couldn't
you--
unknown
speaker
--get
closer
than
that?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--that
was
not
a
litigated
issue,
how
much
it
would
cost.
unknown
speaker
it
was
litigated?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
that
you
have
a...
you
and
the
government
are
wide
apart
in
how
much
it
would
cost.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
finding
of
fact
that
you're
talking
about?
what
number
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
the
assumption
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
service
call,
was
the
district
court
making
a
finding
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
service
call?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
corn-revere.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
