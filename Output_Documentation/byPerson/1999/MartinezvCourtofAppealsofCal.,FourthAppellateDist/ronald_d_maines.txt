mr.
ronald
d.
maines
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
making
a
preliminary
observation,
which
i
think
is
important
because
it
bears
on
the
overall
tenor
of
the
case,
although
i
don't
think
that
it
affects
the
proper,
ultimate
decision
of
the
case.
that
is,
that
mr.
martinez
did
represent
himself
at
his
trial.
he
did
not,
so
far
as
the
record
reflects,
engage
in
any
untoward
antics.
it
didn't
appear
that
he
was
unruly
or
vitriolic
or
attempted
to
espouse
a
particular
political
position
or
anything
like
that.
he
was
simply
defending
himself
as
a
lawyer,
retained
or
court-appointed,
would
have
attempted
to
do.
i
mention
this
at
the
outset
to,
in
some
sense
i
hope,
blunt
the
strong
suggestion
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
and
its
amici
that
by
this
court's
determining
that
an
appellant,
such
as
martinez,
has
a
right
to
self-representation
on
direct
appeal,
it
opens
up
a
pandora's
box
for
all
manner
of...
of
absurdness
to
ensue.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
justice
o'connor,
it's...
it's
the
due
process
clause.
and
admittedly,
it's
a
little
bit
of
an
intricate
argument,
and
i'd
like
to--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--it
is
not
the
sixth
amendment,
no.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
it
is
not
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
i
will.
there
have
been
a
series
of
decisions
over
the
years,
over
the
decades
by
this
court
involving
the
right
to
counsel,
which
i
urge
is
the
basic,
generic
right
that's
in
play
in
this
case,
the
right
to
represent
one's
interests
in
an
adversary
setting,
criminal
setting.
the
court
in
its
decisions
over
the
years
has
said
that
there
is
a
particular
set
or
range
or
spectrum
of
points,
stages
along
the
way
where
the
liberty
interest
of
the
defendant
is
particularly
significant.
it
begins
at
arraignment.
it
ends
at
the
point
of
direct
appeal.
and
thus
it
is
that
the
court
can
find,
as
it
did
in
evitts
v.
lucey,
that
a
defendant,
a
criminal
defendant,
has
a
right
to
an
attorney,
a
constitutional
right
to
an
attorney,
on
direct
appeal
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
it
doesn't
derive
from
the
sixth
amendment.
it
derives
from
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
evitts,
indeed,
traced
the...
the
rationale
for
the
right
to
counsel,
but
it
was
very
careful
to
explain
that
the
right
to
counsel
had
a
rationale
which
really
partook
of
both
clauses,
equal
protection
and
due
process.
the
court
was
clear
in
evitts
to
make
that
point.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
that's
correct.
and
here's...
here's
how
the
argument
goes,
lest
there
be
any
confusion
about
it.
there...
there
is
this
set
of
cases
which
the
court
has
delineated
in
which
the
court
has
said
at
this
stage,
at
this
stage,
at
this
stage,
from
arraignment
through
direct
appeal,
appeal
as
of
right,
we
deem
these
to
be
critical
stages
in
the
evolution
of...
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
it
doesn't
end
at
the
trial,
but
it
doesn't
go
on
and
on
either.
it
stops
at
direct
appeal.
thus,
for
example,
the
court
has
ruled
that
in
discretionary
appeals,
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
a...
a
lawyer.
a...
an
in...
in
forma
pauperis
party
is
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer
on
discretionary
appeals.
the
court
has
drawn
the
line
between
direct
appeals
of
right
and
discretionary
appeals,
such
as
cases
that
might
come
before
this
court.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
absolutely.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
there
is
that
distinction,
but
it's
not
a
distinction
that
matters
for
our
argument
in
this
case
because
the
right
that
we're
talking
about
is...
is
a...
a
right
to
counsel
or
not
to
counsel
or
to
represent
oneself,
which
i
maintain
is
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
right.
and
in
the
right
to
counsel
context,
the
court
has
said
that
the
trial
setting
and
the
direct
appeal
setting
are
at
least
that
similar.
they're...
they're
at
least
that
similar
that
in
both
cases
a
defendant
gets
a
lawyer
if
he
wants
one.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
that's
exactly
right.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
next
step
in
the
argument,
therefore,
is
that
if
we
accept
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
on
direct
appeal,
then
by
implication
there
is
the
right
to
represent
oneself
on
direct
appeal.
now,
some
of
you
may
be
wondering
about
that
implication,
and
so
let
me
try
to
flesh
it
out
a
little
bit.
first
of
all,
there
is
precedent
in
this
court,
of
course,
for
the
notion
that
the
right
to
counsel
entails
or
comprehends
the
right
to
represent
oneself.
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
oft-quoted
passages
in
faretta
v.
california,
and
i'll
read
the
pertinent
couple
of
sentences.
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
correlative
right
to
dispense
with
a
lawyer's
help
are
not
legal
formalisms.
they
rest
on
considerations
that
go
to
the
substance
of
an
accused
position
before
the
law.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
they
don't
make
a
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
they're
the
wrong
facts
to
be
looking
at.
if
you
think
about
the
nature
of
a
trial,
a
trial
is...
a
criminal
trial
is
a
very
complex
proceeding.
in
a
sense
it's
much
more
complex
than
the
standard
appeal
from
a
conviction
in
a
criminal
trial.
there's
rules
of
evidence.
there's...
there's
cross-examining
witnesses.
there
are
rules
of
procedure.
i...
i
should
think
that
many
lawyers
would
much
rather
litigate
an
appeal
than
they
would
a
trial.
i
certainly
would.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
but...
but
if...
if
what
we're
asking
what
is...
what
is
the...
what
is
the...
how
do
we
quantify
the...
the
folly
or
the
lack
of
wisdom
of
a
defendant
who
wants
to
represent
himself
at
trial
versus
one
who
wants
to
represent
himself
on
direct
appeal,
i
don't
think
it's...
it's
necessarily
self-evident
that
he's--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--you
can
except
that,
under
one
of
this
court's
rulings,
the
defendant
on
appeal
has
to
forebear
to
a
decision
by
the
appellate
counsel
to
not
advance
a
position
that
the...
that
the
defendant
is
interested
in
pressing.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
no,
he
can.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
i...
i
suppose
that
they
could,
but
i
think
the...
the
critical
question
is
that
given
the
structure
of
the
court's
precedents
in
this
area...
and
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
really
getting
to
the
core
point
here.
given
the
structure
of...
of
the
court's
precedents,
the
question
becomes
whether
there
is
anything
that
offends
due
process,
justice
o'connor,
anything
that
offends
due
process
and
the
notion
that
under
faretta
i
have
a
right
to
represent
myself
on
appeal.
faretta--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--it...
it
doesn't,
but
the
logic
of
faretta...
but
the
logic
of
faretta
is
important.
if
under
faretta
i
have
the
right
to
represent
myself
in
the
trial,
is
there
anything
arbitrary
then
in
the...
in
the
claim
that
at
an
equally
critical
stage,
i.e.,
direct
appeal,
i
don't
have
the
right
to
represent
myself?
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
and
i
concede
that
if...
if
you
can
coherently
argue,
based
on
the
pattern
of
this
court's
precedents,
that
there
is
such
a
series
of
differences
between
the
two
stages,
then
our
argument
doesn't
work.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
suppose
the
defendant's
motivation
is
that
he
doesn't
want
to
run
the
risk
of
getting
a
bad
court-appointed
lawyer.
suppose
the
defendant
is
johnny
cochran.
he
finds
himself
in
california
state
court.
he
wants
to
defend
himself
because
he
thinks
that
he
can
do
a
better
job
of
that
than...
than
any
other
lawyer
can--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--court-appointed
or
otherwise.
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
then
let
me...
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical,
justice
scalia.
suppose
the...
the
individual
in
question
is
a
distinguished
appellate
litigator
and
he
believes
that
he
can
represent
his
case
much
better
than
any
court-appointed
lawyer
can.
court-appointed
lawyers
are
overburdened.
they're
not
paid
enough.
they
don't
have
a
passion
for
the
case.
but
this
distinguished
appellate
litigator,
who
has
fallen
on
bad
times
and
finds
himself
now
convicted
in
california
state
court,
wishes
to
represent
himself
on
appeal.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
well,
he
could,
but
let's
say
that
he's
not
a
member
of
the
bar.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
i
was
simply
trying
to
pose
to...
to
us
a
hypothetical
in
which
one
could
reasonably
have
a
motivation
that
doesn't
necessarily
focus
on
the
fact
that
at
the
trial
level
i'm
the
defendant
and
i
want
eye-to-eye
contract
with
the
judge
or
with
the
jury.
i
don't...
i
don't...
that's
why
i'm
trying
to--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--why
should
our...
our
view
on
what
the
advantages
may
or
may
not
be
determine
whether
the
defendant
has
the
opportunity
to
do
that
if
it's
a--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--it...
it
does--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--it
does
absolutely.
it
does
absolutely,
but
it's
the
same
perspective
that
motivated
a
couple
of
previous
cases
of...
of
the
court
in
which
the
court
determined
that
the
state's
view
of
systemic
fairness
didn't
fly.
for
example...
and
yet,
reasonable
men
and
women
could
very
easily
have
said,
yes,
this
looks
like
a
basically
fair
system.
i...
i
don't
dispute
that
california's
system
looks
like
a
basically
fair
system.
i...
i
don't
dispute
that
the
system
that
california
pressed
in
douglas
v.
california
was
a
basically
fair
system.
there,
you'll
recall,
that...
that
someone
in
mr.
martinez'
position
who
wanted
to
appeal,
who
sought
a
lawyer,
would
not
get
a
lawyer
until
there
was
a
screening
of
the
record
and...
and
there
was
a
sort
of
preliminary
determination
that...
that
there,
indeed,
was
a
non-frivolous
issue
to
appeal.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
we
don't.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
well,
i'm...
i'm
simply
trying
to
pose
to
you,
your
honor,
a...
a
situation
where
reasonable
people
can
say,
yes,
looking
at
this
thing
systemically,
it
looks
like
a
fair
enough
system.
california's
system
looks
like
a
fair
enough
system.
but
when...
when...
but
those
systems
were
not
upheld
because
a
right
more
fundamental
was
deemed
to
be
in
play,
and
that's
what
i'm
arguing
here.
the
same
thing
happened
in
faretta
v.
california.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
we
do.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
i
will.
on
the
second
question,
appeals
are
a
relatively
modern
innovation
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
united
states,
at
least
appeals
as
a
commonplace
matter.
and
there
simply
isn't
any
colonial
or
british
history
that
sheds
a
whole
lot
of
light
on
the
issue.
it's...
it's
not
there,
or
it's...
or
it's--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--it...
it
is...
it
is
freer.
i
take
your
point.
i
think
it's
important
to...
to
make
one
other
point,
though,
in
response
to
your
question,
and
that
is
that
it
seems
to
be
fairly
well
accepted
today
that
the...
faretta's
analysis
of
the
historical
roots
of
the
right
in
question
was
open
to
considerable
debate.
the--
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
--no.
no.
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm...
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
most
important
thing
to
look...
look
at
in
the
faretta
case
is
its
logic,
and
the
logic
of
faretta
was...
really,
even
when
you
think
about
the
text
that
the
court
was
relying
on
faretta,
the
logic
of
faretta
was
if
one
has
a
right
to
an
attorney,
that
carries
with
it
a
correlative
right
to
represent
oneself.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ronald
d.
maines
almost
any
two
categories
can
be
distinguished
if
we...
if
we
look
at
them
in
the
right
way,
can
be
differentiated.
and
i
don't
dispute
that
there
are
ways
to
differentiate
the
appeal
stage
from
the
trial
stage.
indeed,
they
are
different
by
definition.
i
maintain,
notwithstanding
mr....
mr.
foster's
arguments,
that
the
differences
which
he
has
pointed
out
are
not
the
significant
ones
for
us
to
be
focusing
on
in
this
case.
and,
therefore,
that
the
thrust
of
his
argument,
which
is
that
there
is
decisional
difference
between
trial
and
appeal
is
not
the
key
issue
here.
also,
i
think
it
is
important
to
rebut
his
claim
that
our
approach
here
is
that
the...
the
right
to
something,
a
constitutional
right,
if
waived
implies
the
opposite
of
that
right.
i'm...
i'm...
i
am
not
make
that
argument.
the
right
to
counsel
is
not
the
opposite
of
the
right
to
represent
oneself.
they
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
they're
not
opposite
rights.
it's...
it's
completely
different
from
the
situations
that
he
was
positing.
so,
i
think
that's
a
false...
a
false
argument.
i
don't
think
that
holds
up.
i
believe
that
if
the
court
takes
a
look
at
the
pattern
of
its
precedents,
if
at...
if
it
considers
the
stages
at
which
it
has
determined
that
the
right
to
counsel
occurs
at
a
critical
stage,
and
if
the
court
embraces
the
notion
squarely
set
forth
in
faretta
v.
california,
that
the
right
to
counsel
encompasses
a
correlative
right
to
self-representation,
that
the
result
that
we
seek
here
follows
straightforwardedly
if
the
court
has
determined
to
make
sure
that
there's
coherence
in
its
precedents.
thank
you
very
much.
