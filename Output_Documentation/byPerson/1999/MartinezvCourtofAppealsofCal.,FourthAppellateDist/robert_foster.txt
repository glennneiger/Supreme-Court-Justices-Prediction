mr.
robert
foster
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
state
to
grant
convicted
criminal
defendants
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right.
of
course,
if
a
state
chooses
to
set
up
a
post-conviction
criminal
appellate
system,
that
system
must
comport
with
due
process
and
equal
protection.
mr.
robert
foster
your
honor,
i
wanted
to
correct
the
impression
of
this
court.
some
of
the
california
courts
of
appeal
allow
the
pro...
the
convicted
individual
to
file
directly
a
pro
se
supplemental
brief.
some
of
the
courts
will
not
allow
the
direct
filing,
but
what
those
other
courts
will
do
was
allow
what,
in
effect,
is
an
indirect
filing,
which
is
we've
seen
the
court
return
the
document
to
the
prisoner,
saying
any
correspondence
must
come
through
counsel.
counsel
then
submits
the
document
to
the
court
and
they
will
accept
it
that
way.
additionally,
all--
mr.
robert
foster
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
simply
a
process
that
california
has
developed
that
is
not
constitutionally
required.
but,
justice
kennedy,
to
finish
up
the...
the
picture
so
you
understand,
all
of
the
california
courts
will
accept
pro
se
habeas
petitions
from
the
inmate.
because
one
of
the
topics
that
can
always
be
entertained
is
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
all
the
california
appellate
courts
will
hear
from
the
pro
se...
or
the...
the
individual
who
wants
to
be
pro
se
but
is
not
being
allowed
to
be
pro
se.
california's
system
is
very
straightforward.
if
you
want
an
appeal,
you
have
a
lawyer.
if
you
can't
afford
one,
we
will
appoint
one
for
you
at
taxpayer
expense.
frankly,
i
think
that
petitioner
has
conceded
his
case
away
this
morning
when
he
said
to
you
you
have
to
accept
that
trials
are
the
same
as
appeals.
and
he
agrees
that
if
you
don't
accept
that
hypothesis,
his
case
falls.
well,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
wrote
in
ross,
there
are
major,
fundamental
differences
between
an
appeal
and
a
trial.
at
trial,
you
still
have
the
presumption
of
innocence.
you
have
the
right
to
a
jury.
you
have
a
right
to
confrontation.
you
have
a
right
to
venue
and
vicinage.
you
have
a
right
to--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
at
that
point,
he
is
in
charge
of
the
case,
and
there's
a
statutory
right
in
california
to
file
the
notice.
so,
i
don't
see
what
the
impediment
would
be.
perhaps--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
think...
i
think
that
would
be
more
difficult,
your
honor,
because
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
in
california
is
little
more
than
saying,
i
want
an
appeal
and
signing
your
name.
california
has
a
policy
of
liberally
construing
any
correspondence
from
an
inmate
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
and
literally,
i
have
seen
cases
where
it
simply
is
written
on
8
and
a
half
by
11
paper
and
it
says,
i
want
an
appeal,
and
that's
been
sufficient.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
i
think
the
filing
of
the
notice
appeal
is
different...
is
different
from
what
we're
talking
about,
the
skills
you
need
to--
mr.
robert
foster
--conduct
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
foster
right.
mr.
robert
foster
because
in
california
the
notice
of
appeal
must
be
filed
in
the
trial
court,
not
the
appellate
court,
i
would...
i
would
presume
that
that
would
be
part
of
the
trial
process,
your
honor.
and
the
faretta
right
would
govern
that.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
his
constitutional...
in
anders
you
said,
you
give
him
the
right
to...
him
or
her
the
right
to
file
a
pro
se
supplemental
brief.
this
court
has
never
discussed
the
underpinnings
for
that
requirement
and
as
you--
mr.
robert
foster
--a
supplemental...
you're
talking
about
in
the
anders/wende--
mr.
robert
foster
--no,
i
don't--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
don't
think
it's
a
constitutional
right,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
robert
foster
--this
court
has
said
in
anders--
mr.
robert
foster
--you
will
do
it.
and
as
you
know
from
the
argument
last
month
in
our
wende
case--
mr.
robert
foster
--that...
that
you
wanted...
i
think
your
expression,
your
honor,
was
to
give
them
the
best
shot
so
we
allow
that
filing,
both
under
california
procedure.
mr.
robert
foster
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
we
do.
mr.
robert
foster
and
that...
that
takes
care
of
the...
the
idea
of
still
giving
him
a
methodology
to
get
to
the
court.
but
i
think--
mr.
robert
foster
--i'm
sorry.
if
the
prisoner?
mr.
robert
foster
no,
your
honor.
as
you
said
in
schlappey,
the
constitutional
doesn't
give
you
the
right
to
a
meaningful
relationship
with
the
counsel
who's
appointed.
of
course,
if
you
could
show
the
deterioration
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
to
the
point
where
counsel
was
not
able
to
adequately
represent
the
client,
you
could
have
what
california
calls
a
marsden
motion
for
a
change
in
the
appointment
of
counsel.
so,
the
mechanism
exists.
and,
indeed,
i'm
told
by
the
clerk
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
issue
is
pending
in
front
of
them
right
now
in
a
death
penalty
case.
mr.
robert
foster
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
it's
exactly
the
parallel
of
the
trial
situation
where
there's
a
breakdown
in
the
attorney-client
relationship.
and
in
a
trial,
it's
probably
more
critical
than
it
is
on
appeal
because,
as
justice
ginsburg
talks
about,
we're
working
off
of
a
cold
record.
there
isn't...
there
isn't
the
situation
where
the
defendant
wants
to
look
the
jury
in
the
eye
and
tell
them
why
he
shouldn't...
he
or
she
shouldn't
be
convicted.
there
are
all
those
trial
rights
which
are
markedly
different
from
what
we
get
into
on
appeal.
but...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
started
to
ask
a
question.
you
have
said
in
ross
and
earlier
in
schwab
that
there
are
fundamental
differences
in
appeal.
the
presumptions
are
different.
appeal,
as
you
well
know,
is
a
very
intricate,
difficult
area.
you're
worried
about
problems
of
mootness,
rightness--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
empirical
data
talking
about
what
has
happened
in
those
situations,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
we've
said
is
that
when
we've
appointed
counsel,
we
entrust
to
the
counsel
certain
obligations,
certain
ethical
obligations,
certain
legal
obligations.
and
the
presumption
after
evitts
and
some
of
the
others
is
that
counsel
will
present
those
arguments
he
or
she
believes
have
a
chance
of
prevailing.
and,
indeed,
you
have
an
ethical
obligation
not
to
present
those
kind
of
frivolous
arguments.
mr.
robert
foster
yes.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
california's
position
is
if
you
want
an
appeal,
you
must
have
a
lawyer.
if
you
can't
afford
one,
we
will
pay
for
it
with
taxpayer
expense.
but
the
recognition,
as
we've
been
saying,
is
that
appeals
are
difficult
and
complex,
and
we
want
counsel
on
both
sides
because
out
of
vigorous
advocacy
comes
justice.
and,
indeed,
this
court
i
think
has
embraced
that
concept
by
the
fact
that
mr.
maines
is
here
today
instead
of
mr.
martinez.
granted,
you're
a
discretionary
court,
but
this
court
has
traditionally
refused
to
allow
pro
se
individuals
to
brief
and
argue
the
case.
i
think
the
rationale
is
clear.
you
want
vigorous,
appropriate
advocacy
on
both
sides.
and
that
isn't...
and
while
mr.
maines
is
correct,
his
client
was
not
disruptive
at
trial,
if
you've
had
a
chance
to
look
at
the
transcript
of
the
trial,
he
injected
all
kinds
of
irrelevant
material
into
the
trial.
he
had
the
jury
find
out
about
his
prior
convictions
which
might
not
have
had
to
happen
had
he
not
taken
the
stand.
at
one
point
when
the
police
officer,
who
simply
showed
up
and
took
the
report
of
the
crime...
he
starts
asking
him
if
he's
ever
been
investigated
or
if
he's
ever
been
arrested
and
has
he
ever
heard
about
the
code
of
silence.
mr.
robert
foster
oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
was
simply
offering
that
as
background
for
the
larger
picture.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
look
at
that
all.
i
think
you
simply
say
that
appeals
are
not
required
by
the
constitution.
they're
a
creation
of
statute.
due
process
and
equal
protection
apply.
in
this
case,
counsel
says
it
is
an
entirely
a
due
process
argument,
and
due
process
always
emphasizes
at
its
core
the
fairness
between
the
state
and
the
individual.
mr.
robert
foster
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
answers,
your
honor.
first,
if
he
doesn't
trust
the
system,
he's
not
going
to
trust
the
court.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
distrust
of
the
whole
process.
and
allowing
personal
access
or
not
allowing
it
doesn't
improve
on
that.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me
it's
still
not
constitutionally
required
because
we're
giving
him
access.
in
the
prison
law
library
cases,
you
talked
that
the
point
was
access
to
the
court
system.
and
we're
giving
him
that.
we're
giving
an
attorney
to
act
as
a...
a
sword
not
a
shield.
the
other
point
is,
to
be
addressed,
that
no
one
is
having
an
attorney
forced
upon
them
because
the
only
way
this
happens
is
if
the
defendant
initiates
the
appeal.
the
defendant
doesn't
want
anything
else
to
do
with
legal
system,
doesn't
file
the
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
robert
foster
the
idea
that
if
this
is
a
government
lawyer,
even
though
he
or
she
says
they're
operating
for
me,
they're
really...
well,
first,
i
don't
think
that's
a--
mr.
robert
foster
--well,
but
i
think
that's
a
trial
concern
as
well,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
that
there's
anything
different--
mr.
robert
foster
--i
don't
think
that's
a
matter
of
constitutional
dimension,
your
honor.
if,
however,
this
court
felt
it
was
of
critical
need,
then
what
justice
kennedy
was
talking
about
earlier,
which...
which
would
be
to
the
pro
se
brief,
would
take
care
of
that
as
well.
and
california,
i
think
we
said
earlier,
allows
it
one
way
or
the
other.
that
material
will
be
presented
to
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
robert
foster
yes.
mr.
robert
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
foster
the
way
you
set
it
up.
yes,
your
honor.
and
additionally,
we're
saying
to
the
defendant,
if
you...
if
you
want
an
appeal
in
california,
you
have
to
abide
by
the
rules
that
california
has
set
down,
so
long
as
those
rules
meet
due
process/equal
protection.
some
of
those
rules
have
to
do
with
standing.
some
of
those
have
to
do
with
mootness.
some
of
those
have
to
do
with
length
of
argument.
and
in
california,
one
of
those
is
you
have
an
attorney.
and
i
think
the
whole
point
of
the
due
process
clause
was
to
emphasize
fairness
between
the
state
and
individual.
and
in
all
of
the
cases
up
until
now,
it
has
been
the
individual
saying,
i
want
a
lawyer.
i
need
a
lawyer
to
be
able
to
fight
the
state
given
its
might,
given
its
wealth
of
resources.
and
what
we're--
mr.
robert
foster
--no,
your
honor.
i
was
unable
to
find
any.
and
it
varies
widely
from
court
to
court.
for
example,
our
fourth
appellate
district,
division
2,
has--
mr.
robert
foster
--i'm
sorry.
no.
that's
san
bernardino/riverside,
your
honor.
that
court
has
gone
to
a
system
of
tentative
appellate
opinions
which
are
sent
out
a
week
in
advance
of
oral
argument,
as
a
result
of
which,
the
number
of
cases
seeking
oral
argument
has
dropped
dramatically.
other
courts
dislike
that
approach
and
do
a
traditional
situation.
so,
in
terms
of
the
number,
i
have
never
seen
any
data.
i've
practiced
with
the
attorney
general's
office
for
over
25
years,
and
i
don't
think
i've
ever
seen
anything
correlating
oral
argument
numbers.
my
personal
feeling
is...
is
i
would
think
it's
somewhere
between
a
third
and
a
half
end
up
with
oral
argument.
mr.
robert
foster
i
know
of
no
state
that
requires
it.
of
course,
in
some
of
your
opinions,
you've
made
it
clear
that
the
courts
have
discretion
whether
or
not
to
do
it
or
not.
i
think
it's
important
too
to
remember
if
we're...
we
need
to
look
at
the
state
cases
because
in
the
federal
cases
that
we've
seen
so
far
are
all
governed
by
28
u.s.c.
1654...
that's
quoted
in...
in
the
beginning
of
our
brief...
which
came
out
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
basically
saying
you
have
a
right
to
proceed
in
pro
se
within
the
regulations
and...
and
rules
of
a
particular
court.
so
that
when
we
look
to
some
of
these
federal
cases
that
have
talked
about
a
right
to...
to
be
in
pro
se,
it
has
to
be
put
against
the
backdrop
of
that
code
section
which...
which
dates
from
the
earliest
days
of...
of
our...
of
our
country.
one
of
concerns,
which
we
raised
in
the
brief,
is
the
implications
of
what
happens
if
you
accept
petitioner's
argument.
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
that
we
are
particularly
concerned
with,
one
of
which
is
how...
assuming
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
go
pro
se
on
appeal,
how
would
you
obtain
a
valid
waiver
from
a
prison
inmate
of
that
right?
because
in
faretta
you
talked
about
the
fact
that
the
judge
can
look
at
that
individual,
can
gauge
facial
expressions,
tone,
inflection,
to
make
sure
that
that
individual
can
make
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
waiver.
how
do
you
do
that
with
an
individual
who
is
incarcerated
perhaps
700
or
800
miles
away
from
the
prison?
we're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
right.
i
think
that
is
a
major
hurdle
that...
that
would
immediately
face
the
courts.
the
other
problem
that
i
think
you
would
immediately
come
to
is
you're
going
to
have
to
revisit
all
of
your
cases
dealing
with
rights
to
legal
materials
in
prisons
because
in
those
cases,
you
were
talking
about
that
the
access
to
the
library
needed
to
be
primarily
for
habeas.
and
you
specifically
note
that
the
individual
will
have
the
briefs
from
the
earlier
state
appeal
so,
in
large
manner,
filing
the
federal
habeas
will
not
be
difficult.
but
if
that
individual,
who's
in
the
prison,
has
a
constitutional
right
to
conduct
his
or
her
direct
appeal,
aren't
you
going
to
have
then
provide
them
with
far
wider
and
more
expensive
materials
than
we
do
now?
could
you
handle
an
appeal
without
lexis
or
nexis
or
westlaw?
i
think
that
the
idea...
what
you
will
have
to
revisit
is
staggering.
we
also
are
very
concerned
with...
in
california
in
order
to
comply
with
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
which
you've
had
on...
on
calendar
this
term,
california,
of
course,
is
trying
to
qualify,
as
most
of
the
states
are,
for
the
fast
track
proceedings.
and
one
of
the
requirements
in
california
is
that
the
counsel
who
files
the
brief
in
a
death
penalty
case
has
to
file
the
companion
habeas
within
90
days.
well,
first
off,
imagine...
we're
all
concerned
with
the
delay
in
death
penalty
cases.
what
happens
to
the
delay
with
a
pro
se
death
penalty
appellant?
number
two,
what
do
we
do
for
the
habeas?
because
most
of
that
habeas
material
is
based
on
matters
outside
the
record
involving
investigation
by
counsel,
involving
runners,
involving
private
investigators.
we
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
consequences
of
the
potential
that
petitioner
argues.
one
of
his
underlying
premises
is
that
the
right
of...
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
carries
with
it
the
right
to
the
opposite,
that
is,
the
right
togo
in
pro
se.
and
i
think
in
singer
you
said
no.
and
you
looked
at
components
of
the
sixth
amendment.
you
looked
at
public
trial,
and
you
said
no.
you
have
a
right
to
a
public
trial,
but
you
can't
waive
that
and
force
a
closed
trial.
you
looked
venue
and
vicinage,
and
you
said,
yes,
you
have
that
right,
but
you
can't
waive
that
and
force
the
trial
to
be
moot.
and
you
looked
at
confrontation,
and
you
said,
yes,
you
have
a
right
to
confrontation,
but
you
don't
have
the
opposite
of
that
and
to
force
the
government
to
try
and
prosecute
you
with
affidavits
only.
i
think
the
point
of
all
of
this
is,
is
that
there
are
significant
differences
between
trial
and
appeal.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
them.
those
differences
fully
justify
the
system
that
california
has
instituted,
which
is
counsel
on
both
sides
of
the
appeal
to
vigorously
argue
it,
to
make
sure
that
appeal
is
not
a
hollow,
meaningless
ritual
but
is
something
important
within
our
system.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
i
would
submit.
