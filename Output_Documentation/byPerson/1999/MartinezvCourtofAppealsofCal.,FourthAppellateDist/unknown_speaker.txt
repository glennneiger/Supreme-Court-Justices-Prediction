unknown
speaker
what
is
the
constitutional
basis
for
your
claimed
right
of
self-representation
on
appeal?
what
provision
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
the
sixth
amendment
you
rely
on.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
the
equal
protection
clause.
unknown
speaker
so,
due
process
you
fall
back
on.
unknown
speaker
could
you
spell
that
out
a
little
bit?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
sense,
i
thought
evitts
perhaps
derived
from
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
an
indigent
defendant
have...
should
have
the
same
right
to
an
effective
appeal
as...
as
a
non-indigent
defendant.
and
since
the
non-indigent
defendant
will
have
an
attorney,
the
indigent
ought
to
be
provided
with
one.
unknown
speaker
and
now...
but
you...
you
say
for
your
claim,
it
doesn't
depend
on
equal
protection
at
all;
it
depends
on
the
due
process
strand,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
of
that
decision
and
others.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
has
never
said
that
it's
a
constitutional
right
to
a
direct
appeal.
unknown
speaker
so,
there's
quite
a
sharp
distinction
between
a
trial
which
surely
is
a
constitutional
right
and
an
appeal
which
isn't.
unknown
speaker
mr.
maines,
we're
now
almost
10
minutes
into
your
argument,
and
we've
gotten
to
where
the
right...
you've
established
the
right
to
counsel.
but
of
course,
what
you
have
to
establish
here
is
the
right
to
represent
oneself.
so,
maybe
if
you
could
shift
over
to
why
the
right
to
counsel
should
be
followed
by
a
right
to
represent
oneself
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
now,
that...
that's
quite
true
and
i
don't
think
you
will
find
the
court
is
doubtful
at
all
of
the
faretta
ruling
where
we've
said
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
at...
rather
a
right
to
represent
oneself
at
trial.
but
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
several
distinctions
that...
that
you've
got
to
tackle.
at
trial,
you've
got
the
government,
in
effect,
coming
after
the
defendant.
the
government
has
to
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
all
the
defendant
has
to
do
is
just
sit
there
and
make
the
government
prove
its
case,
which,
you
know,
it
may
have
some
tactical
decisions
to
it,
but
it
certainly
does
not
necessarily
require
the
skill
of
a
lawyer.
on
appeal,
a
judgment
of
conviction,
the
scales
are
reversed.
the...
the
appellant
carries
the
burden
on
appeal,
and
he's
got
to
make,
presumably,
legal
points
to...
to
a
court,
to
an
appellate
court
that
hears
an
argument
for
maybe
15
or
20
minutes.
and
to...
i
think
you
should
tell
us
why
those
facts
don't
make
any
difference
from
faretta
in
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
true,
but
how
many
laymen
would
rather
litigate
a...
an
appeal
than
a--
unknown
speaker
--well,
except
with...
with
a
trial,
the
decisions
have
to
be
made.
there
has
to
be
one
person
in
control.
on
appeal,
i
suppose,
under
the
california
system
at
least,
the
defendant
can
file
his
own
brief
pro
se.
i
assume
that
is
the
rule.
that's
what
happened
here.
and
then
there
can
be
another...
we
can
accommodate
the
counsel
at
the
appellate
stage.
we...
we
can
accommodate
two
participants.
you
can't
do
that
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
california
system
we're
looking
at,
i
take
it
the
defendant
can
file
his
own...
his
own
brief
in
tandem,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
he
can?
so,
he
can
say,
i
disagree
with
this,
this.
i
want
to
advance
this,
and
we
can
accommodate
that.
but
you
can't
accommodate
that
at
trial.
but
if
i
understand
your
position,
if
you
lose,
they
may...
they
could
take
that
right
away.
if
you
don't
have
a
right
to
represent
yourself,
california
could
adopt
a
rule,
say,
we'll
take
lawyer's
briefs
and
not
take
pro
se
briefs,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
faretta
doesn't
extend
to
appellate
representation.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
arbitrary.
it's...
it's
sufficient
to...
to
refuse
your
claim,
i
think,
if
one
were
to
say,
yes,
you
do
have
that
right
under
faretta,
but
there
are
enough
differences
between
appeal
and
trial
so
that
we
simply
don't
think
the
constitution
carries
it
over.
unknown
speaker
mr.
maines,
why
isn't
this
a
difference?
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
where
he
has
a
right
to
a
jury
is
being
judged
by
his
peers.
he
says,
i
want
to
be
in
control.
i
want
to
face
that
jury.
but
on
appeal
he's
facing
three
law-steeped
judges,
not
his
peers
where
the
facts
are
out
of
the
case,
where
credibility
is
out
of
the
case,
where
the
only
thing
is
the
law.
and,
if
we're
being
practical
about
it,
in
many,
if
not
most,
of
these
cases,
there
is
no
eye-to-eye
confrontation
at
all.
there's
just
a
brief.
so,
i
don't
understand
how
it
comes
to
a
great
constitutional
issue
if
the
only
difference
is
that
your
client
is
getting
something
more,
that
is,
he
could
put
in
his
own
brief
and
in
addition,
he
gets
the
lawyer's
brief.
now,
it
might
be
another
case
if
california
says,
no,
we
won't
accept
the
pro
se
brief
in
addition.
but
the
case
that
we
have
now,
i
don't
understand
why
there
isn't
a
very
significant
difference
between
the
trial
where
the
defendant
says,
i
want
to
speak
to
that
decision
maker,
and
the
appeal
where
there
are
three
judges
steeped
in
the
law
and
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
the
law.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
to
all
the
money
he
made?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
to
all
the
money
he
made?
[laughter]
johnny
is
indigent
at
this
point?
this
is
such
an
unrealistic
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he's
a
member
of
the
bar,
he...
he
could
represent
himself
without
any
special
constitutional
dispensation,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
he
wouldn't
be
a
distinguished
appellate--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
aren't
we
supposed
to
be
dealing
with
the
generality
of
cases?
and
so,
let's
take
this...
this
case.
i
don't
understand
any
advantage
that
a
defendant
would
have
when
the
only
questions
are
legal
questions,
when
there
isn't
that
appeal
to
one's
peers.
i
just
don't
see
why
there
isn't
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
trial
and
the
appeal.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
it
goes
to
a...
a
systemic
judgment
about
what...
what
the...
the
limits
of
fundamental
fairness
are.
it's
highly
relevant--
unknown
speaker
--for
that
judgment
i
would
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
maines,
that
was...
douglas
was
so
equal
protection
driven,
the
idea
that
you
could
get
a
lawyer
if
you
could
afford
it.
and
you
don't
have
any
equal
protection
component
here.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
think
that
that
reduces
very
substantially
any
reliance
that
you
can
place
on
douglas
and
griffin,
that
line.
unknown
speaker
well,
faretta...
faretta
had
elements
that,
it
seems
to
me,
this
case
does
not
have.
two
of
them
that
occur
to
me
are...
are
these.
number
one,
part
of
the
faretta
exposition,
part
of
the
court's
reasoning
in
faretta
paid
very
close
attention
to
the
particular
items
comprehended
within
the
sixth
amendment.
and
the
court
said
these
are...
these
are
opportunities
or
rights
for...
for
individual
action
by
a
defendant.
a...
a
very
personal
locus
was
found
for
these
items.
and
you
don't
have
any
textual
basis
like
that
here.
the
second
difference
that
strikes
me...
and
i'm
less
sure
of
this,
so
you...
you
may
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
recall
the...
the
recitation
of
historical
practice
in...
in
justice
stewart's
opinion.
and
at
least
as
i
recall
it,
there
is
nothing
that...
that
would
extend
to
a
historical
practice
bearing
on
an
appellate
right
as
opposed
to
a
trial
right.
and
when
we
come
up
with
our
notions
of
what
counts
for
or
against
fundamental
fairness,
one
of
the
things
we...
we
look
at
is...
is
historical
evolution.
so,
that
would
seem
to
count
against
your
position.
unknown
speaker
could
you
comment
on
those
two
points?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
take
it
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
in...
in
fashioning,
in
effect,
due
process
solutions,
the...
the
courts,
if
anything...
this
court,
if
anything,
is...
is
freer
than
perhaps
it...
it
felt
itself
to
be
in
faretta.
unknown
speaker
if
we
made
a
mistake
in
faretta,
we
should
make
another
mistake
here?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
maines.
mr.
foster,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
california
does
allow
a
pro
se
appellant
to
file
a
brief
in
addition
to
that
filed
by
the
attorney?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
essential
as
far
as
you're
concerned.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
that...
on
that
point?
do
you
think
the
pro
se
litigant
who
represented
himself
on
a
faretta
trial
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
there
is
an
impediment,
but
i'm
just...
what
if
the
state
passed
a
rule
saying
only
lawyers
can
file
notices
of
appeal?
would
that
be
a
valid...
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
you
would
agree
that
the...
the
defendant
appearing
pro
se
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
even
if
california
adopted
a
rule
saying
only...
it
will
only
be
filed
by
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
your
position.
i
know
you
say
he
has
no
such
right
after
the
appeal
has
been
filed.
unknown
speaker
does
his
right
to
self-representation
go
at
least
through
the
right
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
and
then
my
second
question
is,
if
he
then
gets
an
appeal
and
they
find
an
appellate
lawyer
from
your
appellate
section.
the
appellate
lawyer
says
i'm
going
to
file
an
anders
brief
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
merit
to
your
appeal,
would
the
pro
se
litigant
then
have
a
constitutional
right
to
file
his
own
brief?
unknown
speaker
and
i
understand.
i'm...
really,
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
are
there
constitutional
underpinnings
that
would
give,
in
that
limited
circumstance
at
least,
the
pro
se
defendant
the
right
to
file
a
brief
in
the
california
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
after...
he's
told...
he
either
gets
the
anders
brief
or
he's
told
by
the
appointed
lawyer,
i
don't
think
you've
got
a
case
here.
and
the...
the--
unknown
speaker
--pro
se
defendant
isn't
convinced.
he
wants
to
file
a
brief.
so,
even
there
he
would
have
no
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
is,
was
the...
does
the
constitution
require
you
to
give
him
that
shot?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
happens
practically
if
the
counsel
has
a
fundamental
objection
to
the
attorney
that's
appointed?
unknown
speaker
if
the
counsel
has?
the
prisoner.
pardon
me.
yes,
the
prisoner
has
a
fundamental
objection
to
the
counsel
who's
appointed.
he
said,
i'll
take
someone
but
not
this
one.
does
he...
does
he
have
a
right
to...
to
have
at
least
one
other
choice?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
issue
could
crop
up
in
trial
too,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any...
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
from
any
of
the...
i
gather
there
are
some
states
and
circuits
that
have
said,
you
do
have
a
right
of
self-representation
on
appeal.
is
there
any
evidence
of
what's
happened
in
those
places?
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
often
in
trials...
i
know
they
appoint
standby
counsel.
so,
it
ends
up
that
you
have
the
lawyer
and
you
also
have
a
person
representing
himself.
would
that
be
like
a...
be
necessary
or
happen
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster--
unknown
speaker
--just
to
clarify
that
equal
protection
is
not
in
this
picture,
which
i
think
mr.
maines
conceded,
suppose
we
have
a
very
well-to-do
defendant
who
wants
to
represent
himself
on
appeal.
does
that
defendant,
nonetheless,
have
to
have
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
much
of
that
information
should
guide
our
decision
in
this
case,
mr....
where
we're
presumably
laying
down
a
general
rule?
unknown
speaker
may
i
throw
out
this...
this
suggestion
for
your
consideration?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
one
of
the
things
that's
at
stake
in
faretta
is
a
sort
of
a
feeling
of
autonomy,
that
the
individual
citizen
ought
to
be
able
to
do
something
stupid
if
he
wants
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
most
defendants
who
represent
themselves
are
being
very,
very
stupid.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
kind
of
agree
with
your
basic
principle.
but
isn't
there
at
least
arguably
an
interest
for
the
defendant
who's
been
convicted
by
a
government
that
he
hates
and
thinks
they're
oppressing
the
people
of
his...
his
particular
category,
whatever
they
might
be,
that
he
doesn't
trust
the
system
to
appoint
and
pay
for
the
person
who
has
to
speak
for
him
in
a
forum
that
he
basically
wants
to
challenge?
and
there's
some
sort
of
an
autonomy
interest
that
even
would
apply
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
he
wants
to
have...
you
know,
he
wants
to
have
enough
to
do
with
it
at
least
to
try
for
an
appeal,
but
he
just
doesn't
want
to
have...
have
everybody
on
his
side
actually
paid
for
by
his
adversary.
that's
his
real
concern,
everybody
who's
working--
unknown
speaker
--and
i'm
sure
a
lot
of
defendants
feel
that
way
too.
unknown
speaker
but
we
match
it
in
the
trial
concern
by
saying,
well,
you
can
represent
yourself
if
you
want
to
do
that,
be
that...
you
know,
not
have
confidence
in
the
system.
unknown
speaker
another
way
of
thinking
about
justice
stevens'
concern
is
that
we
essentially
are
in
a
regime
of
personal
rights
and
personal
rights
can
be
waived--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
jury
trial.
i
suppose
the
way
you're
getting
around
that
here
is
to
say
there
is
no
right
to
an
appeal
without
counsel,
so
there's
nothing
being
waived
here.
you--
unknown
speaker
--almost...
the
way
we
define
it
going
in
solves
that
problem.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
are
there
any
statistics
from
the
california
courts
of
appeals
as
to
how
many
criminal
appeals
are...
are...
in
how
many
criminal
appeals
oral
argument
is
granted?
unknown
speaker
that's
los
angeles?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
states
which
either
permit
or
require
the
appellant,
the
criminal
defendant,
him
or
herself
to
be
present?
i
know
they
do
it
in
england
in
the
high
court.
you
see
the
defendant
there.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
foster.
mr.
maines,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
