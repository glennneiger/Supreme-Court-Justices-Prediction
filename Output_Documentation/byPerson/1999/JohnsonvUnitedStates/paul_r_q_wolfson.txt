mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
it
is...
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
have
specific
authority.
does...
the
statute
does
not
have
to
say,
and
the
district
court
may,
in
addition,
impose
a
term--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it
depends
on
how
you
read
(e)(3).
i
guess
i
have
to
come
back
to
that...
to
that
point.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
it's
to...
it's
to...
upon
revoking
a
term
of
supervised
release,
it
is
to
require
him
to
serve
in
prison
all
or
part
of
the
term,
all
or
part
of
the
term
of
supervised
release,
without
credit
for
the
time
previously
spent
on...
on
post-release
supervision.
now,
what
this--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
right,
but
the...
right.
right,
but
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
question
is
what
happens
if
he
serves
part
of
it...
of
the
term
of
supervised
release
in
prison.
what
happens
to
the
rest
of
the
term
of
supervised
release?
that
is,
the
term
is
not...
the
term
is
not
dead.
it's
still
in
existence--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
he
loses
credit
for
time
previously
spent
on
the
street.
so,
if
he...
and
that's
in
(e)(3).
it's
in
the...
this
is
on
page
3a
of
our
brief.
it
says--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
no.
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
i
think
our
argument
does
assume
that
he...
that
he
loses
credit
for
the
entire
period
of
time
spent
on
supervised
release.
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--let's
assume
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
but
the
total
of
prison...
no,
but
the
total
of
prison
and
supervised
release
under
(e)(3),
as
it
existed
before,
couldn't
exceed
the
time
that
he
was
ordered
to
serve
on
supervised
release
initially.
so,
if
he
was
initially
sentenced
at
his
original
conviction
and
sentencing
hearing
to
a
3-year
period
of
supervised
release--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--then
he's
released
from
prison
and...
and
goes
out
and
serves
his
supervised
release.
and
then
he
violates
his
supervised
release
on
2
years
and
one-half--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that...
and...
and
he's...
let's
assume
that
he's
revoked
immediately,
just
to
simplify.
he
loses
credit
for
that
2
years
and
one-half
and
the
3-year
period
runs
anew.
it's
exactly
as
justice
breyer
was
saying.
you
go
back
essentially
to
square
one.
so,
then
the
district
court
says,
what
will
i
do
with
this
3-year
term
of
supervised
release?
that
is
the
term
of
supervised
release.
and
what
(e)(3)
allows
the
district
judge
to
do...
the
district
court
to
do...
is
to
order
him
to
serve
all
or
part
of
it
in
prison,
all
or
part
of
the
term,
and
the
rest
of
the
term--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
scalia,
i...
i
don't
think
i
agree.
it's
a
subtle
difference,
but
i
don't
think
that
i
agree
that
it
is
really
a
new
term
of
supervised
release.
the
point
is
that
it
is...
it
is
the
term
of
supervised
release...
the...
that
is
basically
called
back
and
set
anew.
so,
i
don't
think
that
it's...
i
think
it's
incorrect
to
look
at
it
as
though
the
district
court
is
required
to...
to
impose
a
new
term
of
supervised
release
as
the
sentence...
as
the
statute
was
in
effect
then.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
just
like
parole,
but...
but
if...
if
he
was
initially...
let's
suppose
it
was
a
class
a
felony
and...
and
he
could
have
gotten
5
years
of
supervised
release,
but
he
initially
got
only
2,
and
close
to
the
end
of
his
period
on
supervised
release,
the
prosecutor
or
the
probation
office
says
we
think
that
his
record
warrants
a
new...
an
extension
of
the
term.
yes.
and...
and...
but
that's
not--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
i
think
that
some
courts
have
said
that
you
could
look
at
it
that
way.
i
think
it
would...
but
it
would
depend
in
some
cases
on
how
the
math
worked,
frankly.
i
mean,
in...
in
this
case
he
violated...
he
violated
for
7
months...
7
months
in,
but
i...
but
of
course,
the
judge
was
proceeding
under
(h).
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
but
i...
but
in
justice
breyer's
original
hypothetical,
where
he
said
extend
it
from
2...
2
years
to
4
years
or
5
years,
he's
not
being
sentenced
to
a
new
term
of
supervised
release.
he's
extending
a
term
of
supervised
release.
and
my...
i
think
in
the
same...
i
think
one
should
look
at
justice
scalia's
question
to
me
in
the
same
way,
which
is
even
when
his
supervised
release
is
being
revoked
and
then
he's
being...
he's
required
to
spend
some
time
in
prison
and
some
new
time
on
supervised
release,
he's
not
being
sentenced
to
a
new
term
of
supervised
release.
the
term
of
supervised
release
is
being
called
back
and
set
as
if
at
the
beginning.
and
that's...
i
mean,
i
think
that
that's...
you
know,
one
can
read
the,
you
know,
(2)
and
(3)
sort
of...
proceeding
roughly
along
the
same
lines.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that's
basically
right.
that
is,
when
one
does
interpret
this
statute,
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
what
the
policies
of
supervised
release
are.
and
it
does
raise,
i
think
as...
as
the
first
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
and
one
of
the
eleventh
circuit
decisions
pointed
out,
why
would
one
want
to
sort
of
force
a
court
to
choose
between
sending
somebody
to
prison
and...
and
following
again
the
policy
of
supervised
release?
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
i
think
if...
if
congress
had
wanted
that
approach,
one
would
have
expected
it
to
say
something
like
the
district
judge
must
revoke
his
supervised
release,
and
indeed
one
would
have
expected
that
it
would
have
put
particular
times
that
the
defendant
had
to
serve
in...
in
prison.
but...
but
in
fact,
what
it
did
was
it
said
to
the
district
judge,
all
or
part
of
it.
in
the
end...
and
part
of
it
can
be
quite...
can
be
a
quite
a
short
amount
of
time.
that
is,
consider,
for
example...
and
we've
cited
one
case
like
this
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
cooper.
consider,
for
example,
a
defendant
who
looks
as
though
he's
basically
going
on
the
right
road,
but
he's
having
some
trouble
and
he
commits
a...
a
relatively
minor
but,
nonetheless,
still
serious
violation
of
supervised
release.
and
the
district
judge
says,
i
think...
i
think
you
need
some
time
back
in
prison.
it's,
you
know...
it's
necessary
for
you
to...
to
have
a
reminder
of
what
prison
is
like.
it's
necessary
to
protect
society.
you're...
you're
sort
of...
you've
wandered
a
little
bit
off
the
road.
but
after...
but
i
don't
think
that...
i'm
not
going
to
give
up
on
you
completely,
and
so
i'm
going
to
put
you
back
on
supervised
release
again.
that
i
think
is...
that
is
a
very
sensible
policy,
and
that
is
exactly
the
policy
that's
lost--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
going
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think...
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
it
would
be
an
absurd
result,
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
somewhat...
it
is
a
somewhat...
it
is
a
somewhat
illogical
policy
to
say
that
congress
wanted
to
deny
the
district
court
the
flexibility
to
say
you
should
both
have
some
time
in
prison
and
some
time
in
supervised
release--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
could
have...
it
could
have
said
that.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i
agree
it
could
have
said
that,
but
it
did
say...
but
i
think
it
did
say...
the
fact
they
didn't
say
all
or
part
of
the
term
of
supervised
release.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
what
it...
what
it
points
out,
though,
i
think
is
that
if
the
district
court
saw
that
only
a
short
amount
of
time
in
prison
was
necessary
and
it
gave
that
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court...
if
only
a
short
amount
of
time
in
prison
was
necessary
to
sort
of
get
the
offender
back
on
the
right
path,
and
then
after
the
offender
was
on
the
right
path,
you
know,
it
was
time
to
start
the
supervised
release
experiment
again,
i
think
that...
that...
that's
what
congress
intended
for...
for
district
courts
to
have
the
flexibility
to
do.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that's
basically
right.
and
i
think
that
in
considering
that,
it's
also
useful--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
district
court
does
in
some
cases...
the
district
court
doesn't
have
to...
doesn't
have
to
give
him
another
chance
on
supervised
release.
i
mean,
the
district
court
can
order
him
to
serve
all
of
the
time
in
prison,
all
of
the...
the
part
of
the
term
that
remains
in
prison
and
not
give
him
any
supervised
release.
so,
what...
what
the
statute
does
is
it
says
to
the
district
court,
here's
basically
a
menu
that
you
can
choose
from,
balancing
the
various
policies
of
supervised
release
and
deterring
the...
deterring
the
defendant
against
committing
future
crimes,
protecting
the
public,
but
also
providing
rehabilitation
and
providing
assistance
for
reintegration
into
society.
now,
here...
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that's...
that's...
that
is
what
we've
argued
basically.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right,
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
in
this--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
term...
i
think
the
word
term
in
this
situation
is
used
to
mean
the...
the
sanction
that
was
imposed
upon
the
offender,
that
is,
the...
his
actual
term.
i
think
in
this
respect,
it
is
also
useful
to
look
at
the
experience
under
the
predecessor
forms
of...
of
non-imprisonment
monitoring,
special
parole,
parole,
and
probation,
in
particular
special
parole,
which
took
a
very
similar
approach.
and
supervised
release
is
a...
is
a
close
cousin
to
special
parole.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i'm
not
sure
that...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
to
this
point.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
it
is
twisting.
i
mean,
after
all,
in
the
o'neil
opinion,
the
first
circuit
said,
to
read
the
word
term
the
other
way,
you
really
need
to
say--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--revoke
means...
i
mean,
literally
of
course
it
means
call
back,
and
that's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it
is
used
in
that
way
actually
in
the
predecessor
provisions,
that
is,
special
parole.
i
mean,
it
is
used.
it's
a
very
similar
approach,
and
i
think
that
that's
probably
what
congress
looked
to
when
it...
when
it
was
thinking
about
what
did
the
word
revoke
mean.
in
the
special
parole
statute,
the
parole
commission
had
the
authority
to
revoke
somebody's
special
parole
and
then...
and
then
he
had
to
serve
some
period
of
time
in
prison
after
that.
and
then
the
parole
commission
said
then
you
can
put
him
on
special
parole
again.
now,
there
is
a...
there
is
a
conflict
as
to
whether
it
could
impose
special
parole
again,
but
there's
no
disagreement
among
the
courts
that
it
could
impose
at
least
either
parole
or
special
parole
after
having
revoked
his
special
parole
the
first
time.
and
so,
this
is...
this
is
the
experience
that
congress
has
looked
to.
similarly,
under
the
old
probation
statute,
the
statute
said
that
the
district
court
may
revoke
an
offender's
probation
and
order
to...
him
to
serve
any
sentence.
and
it
was
recognized
that
the
majority
of
the
courts
had
certainly
held
that.
what...
when...
once
the
district
court
revoked
an
offender's
probation,
it
could
order
him
to
serve
another
term
of
probation.
it
wasn't
required...
it
wasn't
limited
to
the
option
of
sending
him
back
to
jail.
and
so,
this
is
the...
this
is
the
experience
to
which
congress
was
looking
when
it
enacted
this
statute,
and
i
think
it
would...
this
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
that
experience
to
provide
some
continuity
along
those
grounds.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
less,
the
better.
i
agree.
i
mean,
i
think
that
basically
the
construction
of
(h)
is
not...
is
not
directly
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the...
the
real
question
is
could
the
district
court
have
done
this
under
(e)
before
(h)
was
enacted.
so,
i
think
it's...
it's
probably
best
just
to
look
at
3583--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
district
court...
i
agree
the
district
court
thought
it
was
relying
on
(h),
but
i
think
nobody
doubt...
nobody
disputes
that
what
the
district
court
was
proper
under
(h).
the...
the
question
is
whether
it
could
have
done
the
same
thing
under
(e)(3)
or
under
(e)
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
(h)
not
being
in
the
picture
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
they
could
have
done
that,
but
i
think
obviously
they
were
aware
of
this
conflict
and
perhaps
wanted
to
make
it
more
clear
by
putting
out--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--they
changed
(3)
also.
i
mean,
they
made
another...
several
other
amendments
to
(3).
they
changed
(g).
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
correct.
so,
i'm
not
sure
i
have
an
answer
as
to
why
congress
put
it
in
its
own
section
as
opposed
to
amending
(h)...
as
opposed
to
amending
(e)(3)...
excuse
me--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
of
course,
to
invoke
the
rule
of
lenity,
the
court
has
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
true
ambiguity
in
the
statute
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the...
the
court
has
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
is
truly
ambiguous
after
looking
to...
to
all
of
the
tools
available,
including--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
i
have
to
say
that
that
is...
well,
that
is...
one
has
to
look
at
(e)(3)
or
at
(e),
the
statute
at
the
time
that
petitioner
committed
his
offense.
obviously,
if...
if
the
court
concluded
that
the...
that
the
statute
is
truly
ambiguous
and
decides
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
right.
well,
right.
i
mean,
i
think
that's...
i
mean,
there
are...
there
are
certainly
circumstances
in
which
not
having
this
option
available
to
the
district
court
hurts
the
prisoner,
or
i
mean,
that
is,
the
district
court
faced
with...
faced
with
the
construction
that
the
petitioner
proposes,
a
district
court
might
very
well
say,
you
know,
i...
i
think
it's
necessary
to
impose
more
prison
time.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
maybe
they
would.
we
don't
know.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
district
court
did
impose
less
time
in
prison
than
the
amount
of
time
it
could
have
even
under
the
old
statute,
which
i
think
actually
confirms
again
that
the
district
court
ought
to
have
at
its...
ought
to
have
at
its
hand
all
of
these
available...
all
of
these
available
tools.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
today...
well,
today
of
course
(h)
does
confirm
that
the
district
court
has...
has
that
option,
but...
but...
i
think
that's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
that
might
happen
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
i
was
assuming
that...
i
was
assuming
that
the
question
meant
suppose
somebody
committed
their
offense
today
with
(h)...
with
(h)
in
the
picture.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
with
(h)...
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
it
was...
it
was
acceptable
to
apply
(h)
because
it
was...
it
was...
even
with
(h),
it's
not
more
onerous
than...
than
it
was...
than
the
previous
law
was.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
well,
it
depends--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
depends
on
one
looks
at
the
amendment
that
was
made
to
(e)(3)
because,
after
all,
what
is
true
is
that
even
before
(e)(3)
was
amended,
under
the
old...
under
the
old
(e)(3),
of
course,
that
the
limit...
there
was
a
limit
of
the
term
that
was
actually
imposed.
but
it...
one
has
to
remember
it
is
also
true
that
under
(e)(2),
the
judge
could
have
extended
the
term
to
the
statutory
maximum,
and
then
it
could...
and
then
it
could
have
been
revoked
and
the
entire
term...
entire
term--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
don't
know
that
the
double
jeopardy
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--is
in
the
picture.
but
the
point
is
that
i
think
that
the
court
should
construe
(e)...
should
construe
with
respect
to
(e)...
that's
the
question
before
the
court...
in
deciding...
in
deciding
whether
that...
whether
(h)
is
more
onerous.
and
when
the
court
looks
to
what
the
prior
law
was,
we've
relied
basically
on
(e)
as
it
was
at
the
time.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
right.
the
only...
the
only
point
that
we...
i
mean,
except
insofar
as
the
statute
needs
to
be
construed,
you
know,
as
a
whole
and
one
has
to
look
at
sort
of
the...
the
menu
of
options
that
the
district
court
has
in
considering
the
policy
of
the
statute.
but
we
do
believe
that
the...
the
authority
for
the
district
court
to
do
what
it
could
have
done
under
prior
law
is
found
in
(e)(3).
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
certainly
courts
have
looked
at
this
different
ways,
but
the...
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
the
mere
fact
that
several
lower
courts
have
disagreed
about
the
meaning
of
a
criminal
statute
doesn't
necessarily
bring
to
bear
the
rule
of
lenity.
and
i
think
that
the
first
circuit's
opinion
in
the
o'neil
case
presents
a
rather
persuasive
explanation
of
it.
i
think
the
problem
with...
one
of
the
problems
with
the
other
courts
is
that
they...
the
other
courts'
constructions
of
(e)
is
that
they
didn't
sort
of...
they
didn't
consider
what
were
the
policy
objectives
behind
supervised
release,
and
they
also
didn't
place
it
in
the
context
of
special
parole
and
parole
and
probation
as
the
first
circuit
did
very
persuasively.
and
all
of
those
are
legitimate
tools
of
statutory
construction
that
this
court
should
consider
before
arriving
at
any
conclusion
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
request
that
the
judgement
be
affirmed.
