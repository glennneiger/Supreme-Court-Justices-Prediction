thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--something
like
that.
something
like
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
reimposition
of
supervised
release
under
the
provisions
of
subsection
(h)
of
the
supervised
release
statute
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause
in
this
case.
the
ex
post
facto
clause
prohibits
any
law
that
is
applied
retrospectively
and,
in
application,
disadvantages
an
individual
by
imposing
a
sentence
that
is
greater
or
harsher
than
that
which
would
have
applied
at
the
time
that
the
offense
was
committed.
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
effectively
conceded
that
the
application
of
the
provisions
of
subsection
(h)
in
this
case
and
reimposition
of
supervised
release
is
retrospective
in
this
case.
however,
the
question
remains
then
whether
respondent
was
disadvantaged
by
application
of
those
provisions
and
reimposition
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
retrospective
means
an
application
of
a
statute
that
is
applied
after
commission
of
the
offense,
the
initial
offense.
and
in
this
case
the...
the
operative
date
is
the
date
of
mr.
johnson's
offense.
his
credit
card
crime
was
committed
in
1993
and
that
would
be
the
operative
date
because
supervised
release
is
a
punishment
that
springs
forth
from
that
offense.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
yes.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's
correct.
that
is
the--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--that's...
that's
exactly
right,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's
correct.
there
would
be
no
need,
as
you
say,
for
congress
to
have
enacted
subsection
(h).
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's
right.
and--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--i
think
that
there
was
an
invitation
for
this
court
to
deal
with
it
because
there
was
a
circuit
split.
and
in
fact
the
majority
of
the
circuits
that
addressed
the
issue
to
which
you
are
referring
have
determined
that
subsection
(e)(3),
the
earlier
version,
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
mr.
johnson's
offense--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
the
decision
in
o'neil
is
incorrect,
and
the
rationale
of
several
courts
who
have
addressed
this
issue
is
more
persuasive.
the...
the
initial
approach
in
determining
whether
subsection
(e)(3)
offered
the
authority
for
imposition...
or
reimposition
of
supervised
release
begins
with
the
statute
itself.
if
one
looks
at
the
text
of
subsection
(e)(3),
it's
very,
very
clear
on
its
face.
it
permits
a
court,
upon
the
correct
findings...
in
other
words,
a
violation
of
supervised
release...
to
revoke
an
individual's
supervised
release
and
to...
to
require
that
the
person
serve
in
prison
all
or
part
of
the
term
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
i
believe
that
there's
a
difference
that
could
be
drawn
from...
from
the
use
of
terminate
in
subsection
(e)(1)
as
opposed
to
revoke
in...
as
used
in
subsection
(e)(3).
if
you'll
note,
subsection
(e)(1)
contemplates
a
termination
of
supervised
release
under
very
favorable
conditions.
in
other
words,
it's
much
like
an
honorable
discharge.
a
person
is
terminated...
a
person's
term
of
supervised
release
is
terminated
if,
after
a
period
of
1
year,
the
court
determines
that
the
conduct
of
the
person
released
and
the
interest
of
justice
warrant
a
termination
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
well,
in
this
situation
it...
it
does.
under
subsection
(1),
the
terminate
does,
indeed,
refer
to
a
favorable
resolution
of
the
supervised
release
term.
however,
under
subsection
(e)(3)
where
the...
where
congress
has
used
the
word
revoke,
it
demonstrates
an
unfavorable
conclusion
of
the
term
of
supervised
release.
and
this
is
important
to
note
because,
you
know,
subsection
(e)(3)
refers
to
revocation
upon
a
violation
of
the
person's
conditions
of
supervised
release.
in
other
words--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's
exactly
right,
and
if--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--yes.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
well,
and
in
fact,
congress
has
made
that
authority
available
by
enactment
of
subsection
(h).
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's
correct.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that
is
correct.
that
is
a
correct
reading
of
subsection
(e)(3)
or
subsection
(h).
ms.
rita
la
lumia
the
starting
point
would
be
a
look
at
the
word
revoke.
and
revoke,
under
the
plain
dictionary
definition,
means
to
cancel
or
annul.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
yes.
for
this
category
of
offense,
that's
correct.
there
is
a
limit
imprisonment.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
under
our
reading
of
subsection
(e)(3)
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
mr.
johnson's
offense,
the...
the
authority
that's
provided
by
subsection
(e)(3)
is
strictly
for
revocation.
however,
in
subsection
(h),
which
you
referred
to,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
authority
given
for
reimposition
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
in...
in
subsection
(h),
where
congress
has
specifically
authorized
the
courts
to
reimpose
supervised
release,
they
have
given
that
authority
upon
consideration
of
the
split
in
authority
that's
come
out...
a
split
in
the
circuits'
decisions--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--that's
correct.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
i
agree.
i
think
that
subsection
(e)(3),
which
is
the
operative
statute
in
this
case
because
mr.
johnson's
offense
was
committed
prior
to
enactment
of
subsection
(h),
specifically
limits--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--i
agree
with
you,
and
under
subsection
(e)(3)
where
the
congress
has
provided
the
authority
to
revoke
a
term
of
supervised
release,
if
one
looks
at
a
common,
plain
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
revoked,
it
clearly
contemplates
a
recision,
an
end,
a
conclusion,
that
type
of
thing,
a
termination
of
a
probation
or...
or
in
this
case,
a
supervised
release
order
because
of
a
rule
violation.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
i
believe
it's
the
government's
position
that
they
may
impose
5
years
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
under...
under
subsection
(e)(2)--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--allows--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--in
this...
in
this
particular
case,
the
extent
of
the
supervised
release
order
at
initial
sentencing
for
mr.
johnson
was
3
years.
the
judge
could
and
did
impose
a
3-year
sentence
of
supervised
release
at
initial
sentencing.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
yes.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
yes,
he
did
and
he
imposed
the
maximum.
upon
revocation,
however,
the...
the
statute
is
clear.
it
allowed
the
district
court
to
revoke
a
term
of
supervised
release
and
required
the
defendant
to
serve
all
or
part
of
the
term
in
prison
with
the
limitation
that
only
2
years
may
be
imposed
for
reimprisonment.
in
other
words,
congress
capped
a
period
of
time
for
a
court
to
impose
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
as
a
punishment
for
that
person's
willful
violation
of
his
conditions
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
no.
in
this
case,
the...
the
court...
well,
there
is...
there
was
no...
there
was
no
initial
5-year
term
that
was
available
for
supervised
release.
it
was
a
5-year--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--yes.
at
initial
sentencing,
the
court
could
have
imposed
5
years
of
imprisonment
and
could
have
imposed
3
years
of
supervised
release
to
follow.
and
in
the
first
instance,
at
initial
sentencing,
the
court
did
impose
25
months
based
on
guidelines
factors
that
were
appropriate
in
mr.
johnson's
case.
in
other
words,
the
court--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--upon
revocation,
the
limit
under
subsection
(e)(3)
is
a
maximum
period
of
reimprisonment
of
2
years.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
no,
not
in
this
case.
the
court
ordered
18
months
of
reimprisonment--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--and
thereafter
imposed
a
sentence
of
supervised
release
that...
it's
our
position,
that
no
supervised
release
of
any
length
of
time
was
permissible.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
1
year.
and
that
placed
the
maximum
period
of
restraint
on
liberty
following
mr.
johnson's
revocation
at
2
and
a
half
years.
under
subsection
(e)(3),
the
maximum
period
of
restraint
in
the
form
of
imprisonment
would
have
been
2
years.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
in
this
particular
case--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--roughly
7
months.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
it
was
roughly
7
months
at
the
time
that
he
committed
a
new
crime
and--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--no.
at...
actually
at
original
sentencing,
the
maximum
was
3
years.
upon...
he
was
released
on
supervised
release.
he
served
approximately
7
months.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
he
had
another
year
of
supervised
release.
however,
that,
coupled
with
the
2
years...
excuse
me...
the
18
months
of
imprisonment
that
the
judge
ordered
upon
revocation,
put
him
over
the
2
years.
ms.

that
the
period
of
time

not
been
reached?
that's
correct.
ms.

i
would
disagree
with
that
interpretation
of
subsection
(e)(3).
ms.

it

excuse
me...
to
require
the
person
in
prison
all
or
part
of
the
term.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
it
allows
the
court.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
i
would
disagree
with...
with
that.
i
think
that
the...
the
notion
that
created
some...
that
there
was
discretion
in
the
district
court's
order
allowed
the
court
the
discretion...
the
all
or
part
language...
to--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--all
or
part
of
the...
up
to
2
years.
and
it
allowed
the
court
to
impose
a
1-month
prison
term
if
the
court
deemed
that
that
was
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
no
supervised
release
once
it's
revoked
under
subsection
(e)(3),
but
it's
not
so
much
all
or...
all
or
nothing.
it's
not
2
years
of
imprisonment
or
no
imprisonment.
it's
a
period
up
to
2
years.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
but
that's
assuming
that
supervised
release
is
a
lesser
punishment
and...
and
i
would
not
be
willing
to
state
that
supervised
release
is
a
less
harsh
or...
a
less
harsh
punishment
than
imprisonment.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
there's
a...
a
limitation
on
what
can
be
imposed.
there's
a...
under
subsection
(e)(3)--
ms.
rita
la

--that
is
the
position
because
that's
the
statutory...
that
would
be
the
statutory
authority
provided
by
congress.
ms.
rita
la

that's
right.
and
i
think
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--under
(c)?
i'm
not...
i'm
not--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--it
is
my
position,
in
our
view
under
subsection
(e)(3),
that
there
cannot
be
an
additional
imposition
of

ms.
rita
la
lumia
--of
any
period
of
time.
ms.
rita
la

in...
in
this
particular
case,
the
resentencing

believe
that
you're
referring
to
is
upon

his
initial

at
his
initial
sentencing,
the
court
had
a
certain
term
of
imprisonment
available,
subject
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
factors,
and
a
certain
period
of
supervised
release
available.
upon

and
within
the...
the
supervised
release
statute,
upon
revocation,
the
court
did
not
have
the
same
period
of
imprisonment
available.
it
had
a
limit
on
the
period
of
imprisonment--
ms.
rita

--yes.
ms.
rita
la

i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--that...
that's
right.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
in
this
particular
case,
upon
revocation,
even
if
we
assumed
that
subsection
(e)(3)
permitted
a
reimposition
of
supervised
release,
the
period
of
supervised
release
that
would
have
been
allowed
was
3
years.
and
in
this
case
if...
if
we
take
the
entire
time
that
mr.
johnson
has
been
under
restraint,
it
would
be
the
7
months
that
he
was
on
restraint
for
prior
to
his
revocation.
ms.
rita

that's
correct.
ms.

that's...
that's
correct.
ms.
rita
la

i'm
sorry.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question.
ms.
rita
la

no,
that's
not...
the
period
of
time
is
a...
may
be
a
lawful
sentence
because
it
has
not
exceeded
the
3-year
limitation.
however,
the
nature
of
the
sentence
we
would
still
argue
is--
ms.

--that's
right.
ms.
rita
la

that's...
that's
correct.
ms.
rita
la

that's
correct.
however,
there
are
certain
limitations
in
the
statute.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's
right.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
that's...
that's
it
in
a
nutshell.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
the
difference
is
that
in...
in
(h)
congress
gave
the
specific
authority
for
reimposition.
anything
called
back
in
order
to--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--however,
in
order
to
undo
something,
one
has
to
undertake
an
additional
act.
in
this
case,
congress
did
not
provide
the
authority
for
undertaking
an
additional
act
to
undo
the...
the
revocation
in
this...
in
this
situation,
and
under
subsection
(h)
it
did.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
thank
you.
i
want
to
address
a
couple
points.
the
first
one
is
the
point
of
policy
that
the
government
makes.
one
must
keep
in
mind
that
the
policy
of...
of
the
imposition
of
supervised
release
at
initial
sentencing
may
differ
from
reimposition
of
supervised
release
upon
revocation,
and
given
that
it's
more
of
a
punishment
for
a
person's
willful
failure
to
abide
by
the
court's
imposed
conditions,
the
petitioner's
reading
of
subsection
(e)(3)
would
make
more
sense,
to
allow
the
court
to
impose
reimprisonment
upon
revocation.
and,
in
fact,
reimprisonment
is
what
triggers
a
reimposition
of
supervised
release.
under
subsection
(h)--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--under
subsection
(e)(3),
the
court
could,
indeed,
impose
reimprisonment,
and
there--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
at
which...
and
that...
that
is
our...
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case.
there
is
no
authority
to
reimpose
any
term
of
supervised
release.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
you
send
him
to
prison
for
up
to
2
years,
the
statutory
limitation
under
the
supervised
release
statute...
any
period
in
between.
and
the
court
can
consider
factors
that
would
be...
that
would
make
a
longer
or
shorter
term
of
imprisonment
appropriate.
ms.
rita
la
lumia
well,
if
one
considers
the
benefits
weighed
against
the
disadvantages,
i
think
that
supervised
release
is
clearly
more
disadvantageous
because
it...
it
imposes
a
restraint
on
liberty.
the
proper
comparison--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--but
the
proper
comparison
in
this
case
is
not
between
an
imposition
of
a
prison
sentence
and
imposition
of
supervised
release.
it's
between
imposition
of
supervised
release
and
freedom.
and
imposition
of
supervised
release,
no
matter
what
the
policy
goals,
is
much
more
disadvantageous--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--well,
that's
correct.
and...
and
even
under
subsection
(h),
if
a
district...
district
judge
wants
to
reimpose
supervised
release,
it's
only
upon
imposition
of
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.
it's
only
if
the
judge
considers
revocation
appropriate--
ms.
rita
la
lumia
--under
subsection
(e)(3),
that's
correct.
