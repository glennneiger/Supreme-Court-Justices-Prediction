justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
(2)
can
extend.
see,
(e)(2)
allows
you
to
extend
the
term
of
supervised
release
if
less...
if
less
than
the
maximum
authorized.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
counsel
participate.
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
it
was
all
within
the
statutory
maximum.
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
it
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your...
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
that
whatever
combination
of
imprisonment
and
supervised
release,
whenever
imposed,
that...
the
total
amounts
of
those
two
components...
the
total
lengths
of
those
two
components
may
not
extend
beyond
the
maximum
date
that...
that
would
have
been
possible
for
those
two
components
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
let
me
make
it...
let
me
make
it
simple.
if
at
the
time
of
sentencing...
forget
this...
i
don't
know
what
it
was
in
this
case.
if
at
the
time
of
sentencing
the
judge
had
said
i'm
going
to
impose
the
maximum
of...
of
imprisonment
and
release,
and
the
maximum
would
have
been
5
years...
he
could
have,
you
know,
given
him
1
year
in
prison,
4
years
of
supervised
release,
or
whatever,
but
the
maximum
is
5
years.
is
it
your
position
that
at...
at
any
revision,
he
may
not
impose
anything
that
extends
beyond
that
5-year
date?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
but
i...
i
didn't
mean
in
this
case.
but
whatever
the...
the...
whatever
the
total
length
of
imprisonment
and
supervised
release
may
be
in
any
case,
is
it
your
position
that
at
any
subsequent
recomputation
under
(c),
the
total
of
those
two
components
may
not
extend
beyond
the
date
which
would
have
been
the
maximum
date
at
time
of
sentence?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i...
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that,
but
if
you
lose
on
that
point,
is
it
then
your
position...
is
your
fall-back
position...
that
whatever
the
maximum
date
for
the
combination
of
those
two
components
would
have
been
at
the
time
of
sentencing
is
the
maximum
date
for
whatever
the
court
imposes
consisting
of
those
two
components
at
the...
at
the
time
of
resentencing?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so,
let's
assume
that
there
could
only
have
been
2
years
imprisonment,
and
whatever
else
there
was
could
have
been
supervised
release.
you
don't
concede
that,
but
let's
assume
it
for
the
sake
of
argument.
is
the
date
beyond
which
that
combination
cannot
extend
the
same
date
beyond
which
such
a
combination
could
not
have
extended
at
the
time
of
original
sentencing?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it...
it
didn't
go
beyond
that.
there
was...
what
was
it...
2
years,
5
months
left.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
you
say
that
is
that
it...
i
take
it,
that
it
would
make
no
sense
or
it
wouldn't
make
much
sense
to
say
that
upon
revocation
the
sentence
may
be
to
all
or
even
a
portion
of
the
original
period
of
supervised
release,
unless
congress
had
meant
that
if
the
court
sentences
only
to
a
portion,
there
would
be
at
least
the
balance
of
supervised
release
to
be
served
as
supervised
release
because
that
only...
that's
the
only
reading
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
theory
of
what
supervised
release
is
there
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
reason...
the
reason
you
say
it
would
be
illogical
to
deny
that,
i
take
it,
is
that
supervised
release
is
supposed
to
increase
the
odds
of
the
prisoner
succeeding
in
working
his
way
back
into
society
without
further
trouble.
and...
and
it
would
be
illogical
to
suppose
that
congress
meant
to
jettison
that
policy
for
somebody
in
your
hypothetical.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioner
cornell
johnson
was
sentenced
to
two
years
of
imprisonment
for
a
credit
card
crime.
his
sentence
also
required
him
to
serve
after
imprisonment
three
years
of
supervised
release.
the
order
for
supervised
release
bore
certain
conditions
and
seven
months
into
it
he
violated.
the
district
court,
after
finding
a
violation,
revoked
the
term
of
supervised
release
and
order
johnson
re-imprisoned.
it
also
ordered
that
following
the
further
prison
term,
he
serve
a
further
year
of
supervised
release.
johnson
challenged
the
reimposition
of
supervised
release.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
district
court’s
order,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
an
amendment
to
the
law
have
passed
after
johnson’s
initial
offense,
explicitly
authorized
its
re-imposition
of
supervised
release
and
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
relied
on
the
amended
statute
in
affirming
the
district
court.
we,
however,
need
not
consider
questions
raised
by
application
of
the
statute
passed
after
johnson’s
initial
offense,
for
we
find
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
amended
statute
to
apply
retroactively.
the
only
question
then
is
whether
the
law
in
effect
to
the
time
of
johnson’s
initial
offense
allowed
“to
reimpose
supervised
release”
and
we
hold
that
it
did.
at
the
time
of
the
initial
offense,
the
law
provided
that
upon
violation
of
the
conditions
of
supervised
release
a
district
court
could
“revoke
a
term
of
supervised
release
and
require
the
person
to
serve
imprison
all
or
part
of
the
term
of
supervised
release”.
as
all
is
it
may
seem
it
first
we
think
that
the
use
of
the
word
revoke
suggest
that
the
term
is
not
simply
extinguished
by
the
revocation.
in
another
section
of
the
same
statute,
congress
used
the
more
definitively
final
word
terminate
to
indicate
extinguishment
and
to
say
that
the
defendant
can
be
require
to
serve
imprison
all
or
part
of
the
term
of
supervised
release
again
suggested
the
term
may
continue
in
a
way
that
would
allow
to
be
reimposed
after
imprisonment
is
over.
this
reading
of
the
statute
is
also
consistent
with
practice
under
the
parole
system,
the
antecedent
of
supervised
release,
violation
of
the
conditions
of
parole
would
lead
to
revocation
of
parole
on
a
new
prison
term
and
that
prison
term
could
be
followed
by
a
new
parole.
while
these
text
rules
and
historical
clues
do
not
necessarily
require
our
reading
of
the
statute,
we
place
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
allowing
district
courts
to
reimpose
supervised
released
following
reimprisonment
fulfills
the
evident
congressional
purpose.
the
aim
of
supervised
releases
is
to
assist
prisoners
in
adjusting
from
prison
life
to
liberty;
prisoners
who
have
failed
once
in
the
transition
can
use
more
help
the
most
and
we
think
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
courts
from
giving
aid
to
those
who
are
neediest.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
in
concurring
in
part;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
