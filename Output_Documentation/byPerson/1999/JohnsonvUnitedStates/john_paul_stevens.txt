justice
john
paul
stevens
(e)(2)
talks
about
extending
a
term--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
has
already
been
revoked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he's
wrong
on
the
statute.
the
statute
is
5
years
prison
plus
3
years
supervised
release
was
the
maximum.
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wolfson,
may
i
make
a
suggestion
before
you
start?
i
think
perhaps
your
opponent
didn't
have
a
full
time
to
develop
her
argument.
supposing
the
argument
were
phrased
this
way,
that
prison
time
and
supervised
release
are
different
animals
and
that
you
cannot
grant
supervised
release
unless
there's
specific
statutory
authority
for
it
and
there
is
no
such
authority
in
(e)(3).
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
there's
no
express
authority
in
(e)(3)
for
granting
supervised
release
after
a
revocation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me...
do
this
for
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me
what
the
express
language
in
(e)(3)
is
that
authorizes
supervised
release.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--served
on
supervised
release.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
justice
breyer's
example
was
no
violation.
they
just
changed
their
mind
and
wanted
to
up
the
sentence
a
little
bit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the...
the
answer
is
pretty
easy
to
that,
that
you
have
a
tough
law
and
order
of
congress
that
says
we
want
people
on
supervised
release
to
know
that
if
they
revoke...
if
they
violate
a
term
of...
of
their
condition,
their
release
can
be
revoked,
and
they
must
now
do
prison
time.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
plain
language
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
there's
no
doubt
about
that
being
a
very
sensible
policy.
the
question
is
whether
the
literal
reading
of
the
statute
is
so
nonsensical.
frankly,
i
think
it
would
be
unwise
to
read
it
that
way.
but
is
it
so
unwise
that
we
can't
believe
congress
really
intended
what
it
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
only...
and...
and
to
answer
it,
they
could
have
spelled
it
out,
but
they
could
also
say,
well
we've
given
the
judge...
judge
his
four
options
in
(e)(1),
(2),
(3),
and
(4).
in
option
(3),
he
can
really
throw
the
book
at
him,
put
him
in
prison
up
to
the
time
of...
spent
on
authorized
supervised
release.
but
that's
his
only
option.
they...
they
could
have
said
that
and
it
would
not
have
been
irrational.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
they
would
have
had
to
do
was
say,
to
serve
in
prison
or
on
an
additional
period
of
supervised
release.
then
all
the
rest
would
read
the
same
way.
that's
what
they
should
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
what
it
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
language.
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
did...
and
they
did
change
(3).
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
instead
of
it
being...
the
limitation
being
the
period
of
supervised
release
originally
imposed,
it's
the
statutory
maximum
that
now
governs
under
(e)(3).
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
answer
i
suppose,
mr.
wolfson,
is
you
look
at
the
rule
of
lenity
before
a
statute
is
amended.
the
question
is
which
would
be
the
more
lenient
reading
of
(e)(3)
without
(h)
having
been
subsequently
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
(h)
is
part
of
a
statutory
amendment
that
made
(e)(3)
more
severe
because
(e)(3)
under
the
new
amendment
imposes...
authorizes
a
longer
period
of
imprisonment
than
(e)(3)
under
the
old
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
statute
as
a
whole
could,
in
some
cases,
be
more
severe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
depends
on
how
one
reads
(e)(2)
because
(e)(2)
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
violations
of
supervised
release.
and
if
it
did,
then
you'd
have
to
have
a
morrisey
against
brewer
hearing
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
that
or
it
might
be
double
jeopardy
to
be
adding...
imposing
a
higher
sentence
later
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
with--
