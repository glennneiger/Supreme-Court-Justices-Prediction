justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
first
circuit,
in
an
opinion
by
judge
selya
i
believe,
thought
that
the
original
statute,
3583(e)
unmodified
permitted
the
same
thing.
isn't
that
right?
that
was
the
first
circuit
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
that
were
the
case,
it
wouldn't
matter
that
3583(h)
was
enacted
i
suppose.
there
wouldn't
be
a
change.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
first
circuit
view,
end
of
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
there
was
a
split
of
authority
and
i
suppose
they
wanted
to
deal
with
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
we
hadn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
so,
what
happened
here
on
the...
the
additional
order
by
the
court?
did
they
stay
within
the
original
5-year
term?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
an
overall
5-year.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
on
revocation,
what
happened?
i
mean,
what
limitation
was
imposed
after
the
revocation
of
the
supervised
release?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
what
was
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that's
your
position.
what
was
imposed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
district
court
thought
it
was
relying
on
(h)
and
that
it
was
going
to
apply
it
retrospectively.
