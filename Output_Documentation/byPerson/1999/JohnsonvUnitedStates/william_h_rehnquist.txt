chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
99-5153,
cornell
johnson
v.
the
united
states.
ms.
la
lumia.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
la
lumia.
i
stand
corrected.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
do
you
mean
or
what
do
you
think
respondent...
by
the
term
retrospective?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
that
offense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
la
lumia.
mr.
wolfson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
ms.
la
lumia,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
(e)(3),
it's
clear
the
court
could,
if
it
wanted
to,
impose
additional
imprisonment,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that
isn't
what
the
ambiguity
is
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
is
whether
it
can
impose
another
term
of
supervised
release
or
more
supervised
release.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
a
judge
is
faced
with
the
alternative,
either
you
send
the
guy
to
prison
or
he
goes
free.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
benefit
of
supervised
release
in
enabling
someone
to
reintegrate
into
society?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
prison
is
a
restraint
on
liberty
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
la
lumia.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-5153,
johnson
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
