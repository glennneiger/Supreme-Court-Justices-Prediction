justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where...
where
does
it
say
that
you
can't...
sorry.
what
language
is
it?
i've
gotten
a
little
bit
lost.
which
is
the
language
that
says...
i
thought
that
if
you
serve...
suppose
i
impose
a
term
of
5
years
for
a
serious
felony
of
supervised
release.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
2
years
passes,
and
the
guy
violates
14
conditions.
i
thought
that
under
selya's
reading
of
this,
which
i
think
makes
sense
to
me
and
the
others
don't,
to
put...
to
say
where
i
am
at
the
moment...
what
you
do
is
you
say
5
years
of
supervised
release.
you
violated
what
you
were
doing.
therefore,
you're
back
to
square
one.
i'll
take
that
5
years
and
i
can
divide
it
3
years
jail,
2
years
supervised
release.
that's
why
they
use
the
term
part.
and
moreover,
it
makes
sense.
why
would
you
normally
have
a
person
adjust
to
the
community
but
the
person
who's
really
worse
because
he's
violated
his
supervised
release,
you'd
say
you're
not
going
to
have
any
adjustment
period.
why
wouldn't
they
want
to
leave
that
up
to
the
judge?
divide
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that.
but,
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
they
have
wanted
it,
as
frankly
i
always
they
thought
they
did,
from
day
one
since
there
is
no
other
reading
that
makes
any
sense?
now,
that...
that's...
i'm
putting
that
pretty
strongly,
but
i
want
to...
i
want
to
get
your
answer.
and
i
didn't
think
it
said
that
you
can't...
if
he's...
if
it's
5
years
that
you
sentenced
him
to
supervised
release
and
he
violated
it
after
4
years,
i
thought...
but
i
might
be
wrong...
you're
back
at
square
one.
you
can
send
him
to
prison
for
the
whole
5
years.
you
can
send
him
to
prison
for
3
years,
whatever.
is
that...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
then
why
isn't
selya's...
we're
back
there.
why
isn't
selya's
thing
the
common
sense
reading
of
it,
and
why
isn't
the
common
sense
reading
of
it
at
least
permitted
by
the
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
(e)(2).
i
mean,
isn't
the
answer
(e)(2)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
he
does
is,
first
he
extends
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
look.
wait.
your
answer
to
justice
souter
couldn't
be
what
you
said,
i
don't
think,
if
i
understand
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
it's
a
class
a
felony,
not
d.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose
the
statutory
maximum
is
5
years
prison,
5
years
supervised
release.
he
serves
5
years
prison.
the
sentencing
date
was
1990,
july
1.
it's
now
july
1995.
he's
finished.
he
then
goes
on
supervised
release.
4
years
and
360
days
later
he
violates
all
the
terms.
so,
it
is
now
the
year
1999.
the
judge
is
perfectly
free
to
give
him
5
years
of
prison
even
on
your
theory,
and
therefore
you
could
extend
the
term
into
2004,
even
on
your
theory.
but
you're
not
denying
that.
you're
denying
that
the
judge,
instead
of
giving
him
the
4
years
prison,
could
give
him
4
years
of
supervised
release.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
there
are
limitations.
if
it's
a
class
d
felony,
you
can't
put
him
in
for
more
than
2
years,
and
yours
happens
to
be
a
class
d
felony.
and
they
didn't
put
him
in
for
more
than
2
years.
so,
the
whole
thing
comes
down
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
revoke.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
view
is
revoke
means
terminate
and
finish.
and
their
view
means
revoke
means
call
back,
but
you
can
still
do
it.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does...
i
wonder...
actually
this
is
a
point
i
had
not
at
all
focused
on.
but
let's
imagine
a
person
who
isn't
violating
anything.
that
person
was
sentenced
to
5
years
in
prison,
followed
by
1
year
of
supervised
release
or
2.
let's
say
2
years
of
supervised
release,
and
he
never
does
anything
wrong.
now,
i
have
always
thought
that
under
(e)(2),
not
(e)(3),
the
prosecutor
or
someone
could
come
in
and
say,
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
that
2
years
is
enough.
i
would
like
his
term
extended
to
4
years,
all
within
the
statute.
it's
an
a
felony.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
have
thought
that
(e)(2),
since
it
gives
the
authority
of
the
judge
to
extend,
as
well
as
to
cut
down
in
the
same
way,
it
says,
that
we
used
to
do
that
with
parole.
it
says
that
right
in
the
statute.
i
would
have
thought
that
gave
him
the
authority
to
extend
or
cut
back
or
impose
new
conditions.
it's
like
parole.
it's
just
another
word
for
parole.
now,
i
thought
that
that
was
so,
but
i'm
not
positive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
relevant
for
this
case
in
the
following
way.
it's
relevant
to
this
case
because
the
person
who
was
sentenced
to
less
than
the
maximum
that
violated
his
condition
could
be
called
in.
the
judge
would
then
extend
the
term
to
the
maximum
and
then,
having
done
that,
revoke
it
and
divide
it
between
prison
and
supervised
release.
now,
i'm
not...
i'm
putting
this
to
you
to
get
your
reaction.
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
the
right
way
to
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
we're
speaking
metaphysically,
i
guess
metaphysically
the
term
of
supervised
release
must
still
exist,
for
otherwise
how
could
you
serve
all
or
part
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
if
you're
speaking
non-metaphysically--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
guess
you
have
to
read
into
those
words
about
supervised
release,
former
term
of
supervised
release.
but
if
they're
saying
former
term,
serve
part
of
it
in
prison,
you
could
as
easily
imply
and
serve
the
rest
of
it
where
he's
supposed
to
spend
it,
on
supervised
release.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
we
speaking
metaphysically
or
non-metaphysically
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
that
because
i
think
where
she's
right...
your
opponent...
is
that
you
do
have
to
do
a
little
bit
of
twisting
of
this
language.
so...
so,
i
would
guess
what
is
the
best
non-twisting
that
you
could
do
and
come
up
with
the
result
that
you
think...
and
i
agree
with
you...
makes
sense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--literally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
first
circuit
calls
upon
a
meaning
of
revoke
as
given
by
sheridan
approximately,
which...
which
i
think
is
at
least
an
unusual
meaning
and
other
than
sheridan,
it
might
be
tough
to
find
examples.
or
have
you
found
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
we
don't
seem
to
use
it
in
that
way.
we
seem
to
use
it
in
the
sense
of
call
back
and
cancel,
except
for
this
time
revoked
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
they
would
in
the
case
of
her
client.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
why?
why...
why
is
it
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
right?
you
know,
i
mean,
this
is
a
part
that...
imagine
the
class
of
people
who
were
sentenced
under
this
prior
to
the
ones...
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
now,
if
you
sent
those
back
for
sentencing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
cut
away
the
option
of
putting
them
for
7
months
on
supervised
release,
the
judge
might
say,
well,
i
can't
give
him
a
supervised
release.
i'm
going
to
throw
him
into
prison
for
the
7
months.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
how
do
we
know
which
way
it
will
cut?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
offense
date
is
no
problem
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
we're
only
talking
about
the
class
of
people
who
committed
their
offense
prior
to
(h).
and
as
regards
that
class,
i
honestly
don't
know,
which
is
why
i'm
mentioning
it
because
you
may
know.
i
don't
know
what
will
happen
to
that
class
of
people
under
an
interpretation
that
says
the
judge
can't
give
them
any
supervised
release
but
has
to
either
give
them
imprisonment
or
nothing.
