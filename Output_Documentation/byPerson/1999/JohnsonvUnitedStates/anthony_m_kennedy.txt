kennedy
but
they
used
the...
the
term
revoke
in
(3)
but
terminate
in
(1).
and
it
seems
to
me
your
position
would
be
stronger
if
they
had
used
the
word
terminate
in
(3)
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
terminate
has
some
sort
of
benevolent
connotation
and
revoke
doesn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what...
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
better
off
with
(h)
because
you
can
say
(3)
has
this
very
strict
reading
and
we....
but
under
your
insistence,
i
think
proper
insistence,
that
we
look
at
the
statute
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed,
(h)
wasn't
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
i
think
we
have
to...
i...
i
suppose
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute
as
if
(h)
were
not
there,
other
than
the
congress
gives
a
reading
which
we
may
give
some...
some
weight
to
because
it
seems
to
interpret
the
statute
in
a
particular
way.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
(h)
helps
you
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
although
you'd
like
to
use
(h),
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can.
i
should
have
said
i
think
it
does
help
you,
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
you
can
use
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
all
or
nothing.
imprisonment,
freedom,
but
no
supervised
release
once
it's
revoked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
all...
all
or
nothing
in
the
sense
that
it's
rather
odd
to
say
that
the
judge
can
either...
must
either
set
him
free
or
put
him
in
prison
and
can't
give
him
the
lesser
punishment.
but
that's...
but
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
answer
to
justice
souter
that
in
your
view,
once
there's
been
a
revocation,
there
cannot
be
the
second
component
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
want
us
to
say
about
(h)?
the
less,
the
better,
so
far
as
you're
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
seem
to
me
from
one
standpoint
that
if
your
construction
is
correct,
they
would
have
gone
back
and...
and
amended
(h)...
pardon
me...
and
simply
amended
sub
(3).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
thought
you...
i
thought
that
your
answer
might
have
been
it
is
an
odd
rule
of
lenity
that
says
that
all
of
these
prisoners
have
to
serve
in
prison
and
can't
get...
and
can't
get--
