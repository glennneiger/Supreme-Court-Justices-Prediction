but
we
don't
weigh
the
number.
we
weigh
the
persuasiveness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
weigh
the
persuasiveness
of
the
court's
reason,
not
how
many
were
on
one
side
versus
the
other.
and
o'neil,
as
you
conceded...
if
o'neil
was
correct,
that
is
the
end
of
this
case.
so,
please
focus
on
why
o'neil
was
incorrect
because
at
least
i
found
it
a
fairly
persuasive
analysis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
can
you
maintain
that
when
(h),
which
does
take
the
position
you
would
say
prospectively
only...
that
section
also
uses
the
term
revoked,
and
then
spells
out
that
you
revoke
it,
you
go
back
to
square
one,
and
you
can
make
the
division,
but
not
quite
as
you
conceded
before
because
(e)(3)
says
even
if
the
term
of
that's
revoked
is
3
years
of
supervised
release,
you
can
put
him
back
in
prison
only
for
2
years
for
this
category
of
offense.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you...
so,
the
extra
year
that's
been
revoked
under
your
reading
doesn't
get
made
up.
it
just
drops
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
the
word
revoked...
you
can't
put
much
weight
on
it
when
it's
retained
in
the
section
that
does
say,
judge,
here's
the
3
years.
you
can
divide
it
not
more
than
2
in
prison,
but
then
you
have
another
year
left
over.
you
can
put
him
on
supervised
release,
using
the
word
revoked.
so,
i
don't
see
how
you
can...
you
can
say
the
word
revoke
means
one
thing
in
(h)
and
something
different
in
(e)(3).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
have
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel,
would
you
please--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--clarify
one
thing
which
i
think
there's
been
some
confusion
about?
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
are
not
contesting
that
if
this
judge
said...
if
this
judge
said,
i'm
not
going
to
put
you
back
in
prison,
but
the
3
years
is
revoked
and
it's
restarted,
that
it
would
have
been
proper
under
the
statute,
as
it
existed
before
(h),
to
say
start
over
on
supervised
release,
3
years
of
supervised
release.
i
do
not
understand
you
to
be
disputing
that.
am
i
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
judge
could
have
said,
without
regard
to
how
much
time
he
had
served,
you
go
back
on
supervised
release
for
3
years.
didn't
the
statute
permit
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
it
permit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
required
prison
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
allowed
prison
time
but
didn't
require
it,
wouldn't
it
allow
supervised
release
to
rerun
on
the
idea
that
it's
revoked
and
it
starts
over?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
or
part.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
excuse
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
statute
says
without
credit
for
time
previously
served
on
post-supervision
release.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
that
those
words
say
you
can
go
back.
you
give
him
no
credit
for
time
previously
served
on
posted...
post-release
supervision.
you
give
him
no
credit
for
that.
you
can
reimpose
that
whole
3
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
no
when
i
asked
a
question
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
you
if
you...
the
judge
is
reading
(e)(3)
and
he
says,
ah,
this
tells
me
he
gets
no
credit
for
time
previously
served
on
post-release
supervision.
so,
we
go
back
and
i'm
going
to
give
him
the
whole
3-year
supervised
release
over
again.
no
jail.
no
prison.
is
that...
was
that
lawful
under
(e)(3)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
isn't
(h)
instructive
at
least
to
that
extent,
that
congress
again
used
the
word
revoke?
so,
we
can
assume
that
it...
when
it
used
the
word
revoke,
it
meant
call
back.
it
meant
it
in
(h)
and
it
meant
it
in
(e)(3).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
inconsistent
with
interpreting
the...
the
word
revoke
to
mean
call
back
because
that's
clearly
what
it
means
in
(h).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
hard
not
to
confuse
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wolfson,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
were
relying
specifically
on
(e)(3)
and
the
reading
of
that,
as
judge
selya
did,
and
you
were
not
infusing
this
section
(e)(2)
that
was
first
introduced
into
this
colloquy
by
justice
breyer.
your
brief
seems
to
concentrate
on
(e)(3)
and
the
meaning
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
but...
and
i
think
you
would
have
to
concede,
would
you
not,
that
there
is
some
ambiguity,
otherwise
how
could
you
account
for
this
circuit
split
that
is
lopsided
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
why
that's
the
proper
comparison
because
you're
denying
the
district
judge
under
the
old
law
the
ability
to
say
i
won't
send
them
to
prison
at
all,
but
i
am
going
to
reimpose
supervised
release.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
even
i
agreed
with
you
about
that,
you
are
saying
it's
got
to
be
the
maximum
prison.
the
judge
can't
divide
it
up
between
the
two.
it's
got
to
be
the
2
years
in
prison,
not
1
year
in
prison,
1
year
supervised
release.
