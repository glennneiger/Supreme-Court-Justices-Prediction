justice
antonin
scalia
it's
like
scalia.
right?
lumia.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
more
than
just
unfavorable.
isn't
it?
i
thought
the
strongest
point
for
your
case
is
that
(3)
goes
on
to
say
that
the
term...
that
the
time
he
has
already
served
in
supervised
release
will
not
count
towards
his
future
prison
time.
and
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
not
counting
towards
it,
the
whole
thing
has
to
be
revoked.
it
isn't
just
terminated.
it's
revoked
as
though...
as
though
it
never
occurred,
and...
and
the
full
amount
of
that
supervised
release
time
will
now
be
served
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
that
explains
using
revoked
instead
of
terminated
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
la
lumia,
is...
is
judge
selya's
position,
the
government's
position
here,
that
the
only
supervised
release
that
can
be
imposed
after
the
revocation
is
whatever
had
not
yet
been
served?
i
mean,
let's
assume
he
had
been
given
5
years
of
supervised
release.
he...
he
violates
the
terms
after
2
years,
and
is...
is
it...
is
it
selya's
position
and
the
government's
position
that
the
court
can
impose
an
additional
5
years
of
supervised
release
afterwards
or
only
3
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
full
5
years.
so,
really
what
you
need
to
get
to
selya's
very
intelligent
position,
as
judge
breyer
sees
it,
makes
more
sense.
it
probably
does.
but
to
get
there,
what
you
need
is
some
authorization
to
impose
a
term
of
supervised
release
at
this
stage,
and
the
only...
the
only
authorization
for
imposing
supervised
release
is
3583(a),
which
says
the
court
in
imposing
a
sentence
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
a
felony
or
misdemeanor
may
include
as
part
of
the
sentence.
at
the
original
sentencing,
you
have
authority
to
impose
5
years.
i
don't
know
where
you
get
the
authority
to
impose
5
years
under
(e)(3).
maybe...
maybe
you
have
authority
to
use
the
leftover...
the
leftover
3
years,
but
where
do
you
get
authority
to
impose
the...
the
new
5?
you're
not
the
one
who
should
answer
that
question,
but
the
government
will
answer
it,
i
am
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
(e)(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
the
maximum
was...
was
imposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
was...
was
previously
imposed.
i'm
assuming
he
imposed
5
years
and
the
guy...
which
is
all
that
was
authorized.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
counsel
doesn't
understand
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
the
maximum
he
could
have
imposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
total...
but
the
total
supervised
release
was
still
under
3
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
supervised
release
had
he
served
before
he
violated
it
and
it
was...
and
it
was
revoked?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
all
within
the
statutory
maximum
for
supervised
release
at
the
original
sentencing.
justice
antonin
scalia
right
and
now
has
another...
another
how
many?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
and
then
some.
you
go
beyond
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
won't
help
you
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
won't
help
you
in
this
case.
i
mean,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
the
originally
sentenced
term,
not
the
authorized
term,
but
the
term
to...
so,
you
would
agree
that
you
can
never
sentence
him
to
a
new
term
of
supervised
release,
a
new
3-year
term
if
that
was
the
original
limit.
if
he's
already
served
a
year
of
it,
the
most
you
can
do
is
put
him...
according
to
your
theory,
is
put
him
in
jail
for
a
year
and
then
2
years
of
supervised
release,
which
is
what
would
have
been
left.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
uses
credit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--against
the
jail
time
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
he
loses
credit
against
the...
against
the
future...
in
fact,
i
guess
it
says
nothing
about
the
future
supervised
release
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
both--
justice
antonin
scalia
--both
against
prison
and
against
a
future
supervised
release
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
authorize
him
to
spend
part
of
it
in
supervised
release?
the
old
sentence
of
supervised
release
has
been
revoked.
i
assume
you
need
some
new
authority
to
prescribe
a
new
term
of
supervised
release.
where
did
you
get
that
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
we
don't
want...
we
don't
want
some
bleeding
heart
judge
to...
to
refuse
to
give
them
the
full
time
in
prison
by
giving
him
some
of
that
time
back
on
release
which
they've
just
violated.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
want
that
to
happen.
the
only
option
we're
going
to
give
these
judges
is
to
send
them
to
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
makes
some
sense.
you
don't
have
to
agree
with
it,
but
it
makes
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
the
guy
had
already
forfeited
his
entitlement
to
that
by
violating
the
conditions
once.
why
is
it
irrational
to
say,
you
know,
we
tried
to
help
you
out,
but
you
know,
you...
you
ingrate,
you
violated
the
terms
of
it.
we're
not
going
to
give
you
another...
another
round
of
the
same
thing
so
you
can
go...
go
off
and...
and
rob
another
grocery
store,
you
know,
whatever--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
what
about...
what
about
the
rule
of
lenity?
now
that...
now
that
whatever
(3)
originally
meant
doesn't
matter,
since
we
have
(h),
isn't...
doesn't
the
rule
of
lenity
counsel
that
we
interpret
(3)
the
way
petitioner
would
have
it
rather
than
the
way
you
would
because
hers
will...
will
come
down
less
hard
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
you
don't
think
there's
a
true
ambiguity
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
argue
that
your
position
is
not...
is
not
only
right,
but
it's
not
even
the
resolution
of
an
ambiguity?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
i
have
no
trouble
with
that.
let's
assume
i
have
no
trouble
with
the
proposition
that
it
is
at
least...
at
least...
ambiguous
if
not
contrary--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
no
doubt
true
if
you...
if
you
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
as
of...
as
of
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
but
interpreting
the
statute
currently,
there
is
no
doubt
which
interpretation
is
more
favorable
to
defendants.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
to
any
defendant.
i...
i
don't
see
how
any
defendant
could
be
disadvantaged
by
the
interpretation
that
petitioner
asserts
today.
any
defendant
today
can
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
would
apply
(h)
to
those
people
even
if
the
offense
was
committed
before
(h)
was
adopted.
(h)...
there's
no
problem
in
applying
(h)
to
those
people
today
if
it...
if
it
provides
more
liberal
treatment
for
them.
don't
you
think
that
even
for
offenses
committed
before
(h)
was
enacted,
(h)
can
be
applied
nowadays?
is...
is
that
the
government's
position
that
(h)
only
applies
to
prisoners--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
committed
their
offenses
after
(h)
was
enacted?
