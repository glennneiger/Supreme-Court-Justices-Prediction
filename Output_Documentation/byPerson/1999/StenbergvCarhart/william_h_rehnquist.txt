chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-830,
don
stenberg
v.
leroy
carhart.
mr.
stenberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
a
facial
challenge,
general
stenberg?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
court
of
appeals...
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
whether
it
was
treating
this
as
a
facial
challenge,
or
an
as-applied
challenge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
we
have
held,
have
we
not,
that
a
federal
court
in
construing
a
state
statute
is
obligated
to,
if
there's
constitutional
doubt
to
construe
in
a
reasonable
way
that
will
avoid
the
constitutional
doubt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
are...
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
construction
of
the
statute
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
followed
our
admonition
that
when
you
have
two
plausible
constructions
available
and
one
would
avoid
constitutional
difficulty,
you
should
follow
that,
even
though
it's
a
state
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
ordinarily
go
into
the
testimony
of
witnesses?
these
were
witnesses
at
a
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
what
authority
do
they
have
to
speak
to
the
construction
of
a
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
witnesses
compared
it
to
the
language
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your...
your
opponent
argues
the
language
in
casey
suggests
that
those
are
not
the
only
two.
you
disagree
with
that,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
hasn't
there
been
some
criticism
of
the
health
exception
as
it
has
been
used
in
some
circumstances
as
a
way
of
simply
avoiding
the
prohibition
entirely
by
a
doctor
who
says
there's
always
a
health
exception?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
whence
the
criticism?
is
it
just
totally
based
on
no
evidence
whatever?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about...
are
you
saying
that
there's
simply
no
basis
for
saying
that
a
health
exception
could
be
used
by
doctors
who
wish
to
avoid
the
general
prohibition
to
get
out
of
it
in
more
cases
than
they
should?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
heller.
general
stenberg,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
stenberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-830,
stenberg
against
carhart,
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
