justice
clarence
thomas
it
behooves
me
to
say
a
few
words
in
dissent.
abortion
debates
are
as
justice
breyer
said
frequently
among
the
most
contentious
in
american
society.
what
distinguishes
this
case,
however
from
many
of
the
other
abortion
cases,
is
that
the
use
of
partial
birth
abortion
is
not
an
issue
on
which
the
american
people,
unlike
this
court,
have
been
deeply
divided.
to
the
contrary,
the
state
of
nebraska,
the
nebraska
legislature,
adopted
the
statute
before
us
by
a
vote
of
99
to
1.
many
of
the
other
30
state
legislatures
that
adopted
partial
birth
abortions,
bans
in
the
last
five
year
did
so
by
similarly
overwhelming
margins.
the
american
medical
association
endorsed
a
congressional
ban
on
the
procedure,
stating
that
it
was
not
an
acceptable
medical
practice
and
the
vast
majority
of
doctors,
who
perform
abortions,
decline
to
use
this
procedure.
the
court
nevertheless
holds
today,
that
nebraska’s
partial
birth
abortion
ban
is
unconstitutional
under
this
court’s
decision
in
planned
parenthood
versus
casey.
because
it
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
woman
seeking
abortions,
i
think,
that
this
conclusion
in
indefensible.
to
began
with
the
court’s
undue
burden
standard
is
no
more
legitimate
today
than
it
was
when
casey
was
decided.
casey
like
its
predecessor,
roe
versus
wade,
wrongly
deprived
the
people
of
this
country
of
the
right
to
determine
whether
the
consequences
of
abortion
to
the
unborn
child
and
to
society
outweigh
the
burden
of
an
unwanted
pregnancy
on
the
mother.
the
constitution
leaves
resolution
of
the
abortion
debate
to
the
political
process,
not
to
this
court.
if
they
choose
states
may
protect
abortion
on
demand
but
nothing
in
the
constitution
says,
that
they
must
do
so.
even
assuming
however,
as
the
majority
does
that
casey’s
undue
burden
standard
governs
this
case,
the
majority’s
decision
is
grievously
wrong.
in
casey,
the
joined
opinion
defined
undue
burden
to
mean,
that
an
abortion
regulation
is
unconstitutional
if
it
places
a
substantial
obstacle
in
the
woman’s
path.
there
is
no
justification
for
the
majority’s
conclusion
that
nebraska’s
partial
birth
abortion
statute
places
such
an
obstacle
in
the
path
of
any
woman
seeking
an
abortion.
it
is
necessary
at
the
outset
to
address
an
argument
made
by
two
members
of
the
majority
that
the
partial
birth
abortion
ban
serves
no
legitimate
state
interest.
that
it
does
should
in
a
civilized
society
be
indisputable.
during
a
partial
birth
abortion,
the
physician
pulls
the
fetus
from
the
woman
by
its
legs,
until
only
the
head
remains
in
uterus.
the
physician
takes
a
pair
of
scissors
or
some
other
sharp
instrument
and
thrusts
it
into
the
fetus’s
head
to
create
a
hole.
then
using
a
small
vacuum
tube,
the
physician
literally
sucks
the
fetus’s
brain
from
its
skull.
when
the
fetus’s
head
collapses,
the
physician
will
pull
the
head,
the
dead
fetus
from
the
woman’s
body.
despite
the
conclusion
of
thirty
states
that
this
procedure
is
too
closely
resembles
infanticide,
two
members
of
the
majority
argue
that
it
is
ethically
indistinguishable
from
any
other
forms
of
late
term
abortion.
there
is
not
point
in
trying
to
argue
otherwise.
my
views
and
the
views
of
the
majority
on
the
matter
are
simply
irrelevant.
as
justice
kennedy
explains
in
his
dissenting
opinion
the
issue
is
not
whether
members
of
the
judiciary
can
see
a
difference
between
abortion
procedures,
it
is
whether
nebraska
can.
the
court’s
refusal
to
recognize
nebraska’s
right
to
declare
a
moral
difference
is
a
dispiriting
disclosure
of
the
illogic
and
illegitimacy
of
the
court’s
approach
to
the
entire
case.
nebraska
was
entitled
to
find
the
existence
of
a
consequential
moral
difference
between
the
procedures.
the
majority
holds
that
the
nebraska
statute
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
women
seeking
abortions,
because
a
statute
which
on
its
face
applies
only
to
partial
birth
abortion
procedure,
i
have
described
should
be
read
to
prohibit
a
more
commonly
used
method
of
abortion
known
as
dilation
and
evacuation.
as
i
discussed
in
some
detail
in
my
dissent,
the
majority
can
reach
this
conclusion
only
by
disregarding
the
plain
words
of
the
nebraska
statute,
as
well
as
long
standing
principles
of
statutory
construction.
federal
courts
are
required
to
construe
any
ambiguity
in
a
state
statute,
so
as
to
render
it
constitutional.
the
majority
turns
this
principle
on
its
head
by
straining
to
find
ambiguity
were
none
exists
so,
as
to
render
the
statute
unconstitutional.
finally,
the
majority
invents
a
new
health
exception
requirement
that
dramatically
expands
our
prior
abortion
cases
and
threatens
to
undue
any
state
regulation
of
abortion
procedures.
according
to
the
majority,
any
prohibition
of
a
particular
abortion
procedure
is
required
to
include
a
health
exception,
so
long
as
medical
opinion
is
divided
on
its
relative
safety.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
my
dissent,
the
state
of
nebraska
was
entitled
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
reliable
medical
authority
supporting
use
of
the
partial
birth
abortion
procedure,
but
this
fact
is
irrelevant
to
the
court’s
decision.
in
the
majority’s
view
all
that
is
actually
required,
is
that
any
individual
doctor
reasonably
believe
that
the
method
he
wishes
to
employ
is
marginally
safer
than
available
alternatives.
any
doctor
wishing
to
perform
a
partial
birth
abortion
procedure
could
do
so
with
impunity
simply
by
insisting
that
he
believe
the
procedure
to
be
the
safest
for
the
woman.
it
is
impossible
under
the
majority’s
opinion
for
any
state
to
effectively
ban
the
partial
birth
abortion
procedure
because
the
individual
physician’s
judgment
will
always
trump
the
states.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
a
state
from
banning
this
horrifying
and
rarely
used
procedure
that
many
find
hard
to
distinguish
from
infanticide.
it
is
inconceivable
to
me,
as
i
am
sure
it
will
be
to
the
people
of
nebraska
and
29
other
states
that
this
court
would
hold
otherwise.
as
justice
kennedy
stated,
today’s
decision
nullifies
a
law,
expressing
the
will
of
the
people
nebraska
that
medical
procedures
must
be
governed
by
intrinsic
value
of
human
life,
including
life
of
the
unborn.
i
am
confident
that
future
generations
will
read
this
court’s
opinion
with
astonishment
and
wonder
how
this
institution
strayed
so
far
off
course,
but
for
today,
i
can
offer
no
explanation.
the
court’s
decision
is
indefensible.
i
respectfully
dissent.
