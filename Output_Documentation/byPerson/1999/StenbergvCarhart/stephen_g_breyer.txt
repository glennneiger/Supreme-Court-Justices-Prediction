justice
stephen
g.

if
i
read
these
correctly,
and
i'm
not
a
doctor,
it
seems
to
me
a
lot
of
the
amici
on
the
other
side
representing
medical
organizations
say
that
there
could
be
circumstances
where
this
d&e
procedure
is
more
risky
for
the
health
of
the
woman.
for
example,
hurting
the
womb
so
perhaps
the
woman
couldn't
have
children
in
the
future,
and
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
circumstances
where
labor-induced
abortion...
you
know,
induced
labor
can
be
more
dangerous.
at
least
they
list
quite
a
few.
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
where
the
medical
opinion
seems
at
least
divided?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
the
medical
opinion
is
divided,
and
then
if
there
are
doctors
who
feel
it
is
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
then
what
is
the
excuse
for
the
legislature
not
putting
in
an
exception
for
health,
since,
after
all,
if
you're
right
on
the
facts,
it
would
make
no
difference,
and
if
you're
wrong
on
the
facts
it
would
violate
roe
and
casey?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
that
some
of
the
time
d&e
could
be
that,
or
all
the
time?
my
impression
in
reading
it
was
that
some
significant
part
of
the
time
this
could...
this
statutory
wording
would
be
satisfied
with
the
d&e.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
majority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it...
is
it
the
case
that
the
risk...
i
thought
the
risks
being
insubstantial
was
of
a
kind
where
we
say
one
in
a
million.
but
once
we've
identified
the
woman,
for
that
woman
it's
no
longer
insubstantial,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
therefore
a
health
exception
or
a
life
exception
helps
that
single
woman.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
concerns
the
right
to
an
abortion.
we
understand
the
immensely
controversial
nature
of
the
problem.
millions
of
americans
believe
that
life
begins
at
conception
and
that
consequently
an
abortion
is
like
causing
the
death
of
an
innocent
child.
they
recoil
at
the
thought
of
a
law
that
would
permit
it.
other
millions
fear
that
a
law
that
forbids
abortion
would
condemn
many
american
women
to
lives
that
lack
dignity,
depriving
them
of
equal
liberty
and
leading
those
with
least
resources
to
undergo
illegal
abortions
with
attendant
risks
of
death
and
suffering.
taking
account
of
these
virtually
irreconcilable
points
of
view,
aware
that
constitutional
law
must
govern
a
society
whose
different
members
sincerely
hold
directly
opposing
views
and
considering
the
matter
in
light
of
the
constitution’s
guarantees
of
fundamental
individual
liberty.
this
court,
in
the
course
of
a
generation
has
determined
in
roe
v.
wade
and
then
re-determined
in
casey
v.
planned
parenthood,
that
the
constitution
offers
basic
protection
to
the
woman’s
right
to
choose.
we
shall
not
revisit
those
basic
legal
principles.
here,
in
this
case,
we
simply
apply
the
principles
to
the
circumstances
before
us.
the
nebraska
statute
that
we
consider
says,
“no,
partial
birth
abortions
shall
be
performed”
in
nebraska,
unless
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
the
mother.
the
statute
goes
on
to
define
partial
birth
abortion
in
more
specific
anatomical
terms,
it
then
applies
to
abortions
performed
before
the
fetus
is
viable,
as
well
as
those
after
viability.
we
determined
statute’s
lawfulness
by
applying
three
basic
principles
set
forth
in
casey:
the
first
principle
is
that
prior
to
viability
a
“woman
has
a
right
to
choose
to
terminate
her
pregnancy”;
the
second
is
that
a
“law
which
imposes
an
undue
burden
on”
that
decision
is
unconstitutional;
the
third
as
we
understand
it
is
that,
a
state
can
forbid
an
abortion
only
if
it
also
maintains
exceptions
in
its
law,
which
exceptions
will
permit
abortion
“where
it
is
necessary
inappropriate
medical
judgment
for
the
preservation
of
the
life,
or
health
of
the
mother”.
now,
we
apply
those
three
principles
and
in
doing
that
we
conclude
that,
the
nebraska
statute
violates
the
constitution.
for
one
thing,
the
statute
is
too
broad.
it
may
well
be
aimed
primarily
at
the
partial
birth
abortion
procedure.
a
procedure
used
typically
after
the
sixteenth
week
of
pregnancy
but
before
the
fetus
is
viable.
a
procedure
that
is
known
technically
as
a
d&x
procedure,
but
as
currently
written,
the
statute
sweeps
well
beyond
that
procedure
and
also
forbids
a
different
commonly
used
procedure.
a
procedure
used
typically
after
the
thirteenth
week
of
pregnancy,
but
before
the
fetus
is
viable,
which
procedure
is
known
technically
as
the
d&e
procedure.
as
nebraska
itself
concedes,
if
the
statute
forbids
not
only
d&x
but
also
d&e,
it
places
a
“undue
burden”
on
the
woman’s
right
to
choose
and
consequently
violates
the
constitution.
the
parties
disagree
about
whether
it
is
reasonably
possible
to
adopt
a
more
narrow
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
would
limit
its
scope,
so
that
it
went
not
at
all
beyond
the
d&x.
the
only
way
we
have
been
able
to
resolve
this
disagreement,
is
to
examine
the
statute’s
wording,
in
light
of
the
two
procedures,
technical
medical
details.
we
have
therefore
had
to
examine
those
technical
medical
details,
explicitly
and
in
depth,
our
opinion
does
that.
we
conclude
that
the
statute
cannot
be
reasonably
interpreted
as
if
it
were
limited
to
the
d&x
procedure
alone.
it
covers
the
d&e
procedure
as
well.
consequently
it
violates
the
constitution.
nebraska’s
ban
on
partial
birth
abortion
also
fails
to
meet
the
constitution’s
requirement
that
a
statute
not
in
danger
a
woman’s
health
when
it
regulates
the
methods
of
abortion.
casey
requires
a
health
exception,
where
a
procedure
is
“necessary
in
appropriate
medical
judgment
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother."
nebraska
has
provided
an
exception
for
the
life,
but
not
for
the
health
of
the
mother.
the
state
argued
that
no
health
exception
was
needed
because
the
d&x
procedure
is
“never
necessary
to
preserve
the
health
of
woman”,
and
we
recognize
some
medical
uncertainty
about
just,
when,
or
whether
the
d&x
procedure
is
safer
procedure,
than
alternative
procedures.
but
a
substantial
body
of
medical
opinion
believes
that
the
d&x
procedure
may
well
prove
safer
for
some
patients.
if
that
body
of
opinion
is
right
than
the
absence
of
a
health
exception
will
place
some
woman
at
an
unnecessary
risk
of
tragic
health
consequences.
after
examining
the
matter
closely,
and
in
depth,
we
conclude
that
substantial
medical
authority
does
support
the
proposition
that
the
statute’s
ban
will
endanger
the
health
of
some
woman.
casey
consequently
requires
a
health
exception.
the
statute
lacks
that
exception,
it
therefore
violates
the
constitution
for
this
reason
as
well.
