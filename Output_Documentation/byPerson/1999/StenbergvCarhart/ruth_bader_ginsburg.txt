justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
stenberg,
i
just
would
like
to
clarify
one
thing.
you
say,
borders
on
infanticide.
i
thought
that
this
case
related
only
to
pre-viability.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
only
the
pre-viable
stage,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
know
what
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
would
say
about
a
position
that
you're
taking
in
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
you
need
an
exception
for
life,
because
if
you
say
the
d&x
procedure
is
never
medically
necessary,
then
what
you're
saying
about
no
need
for
a
health
exception
would
seem
to
apply
as
well
to
a
life
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
ask
the
district
court
to
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
ask
the
district
court
to
certify
the
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
didn't
suggest
it
at
the
district
court
level,
did
you
suggest
it
at
the
eighth
circuit
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
know,
that's
one
of
the
notable
differences
between
arizonans
and
this
case,
is
they
had
the
attorney
general
from
day
1
say
to
the
district
court,
please
certify
it
to
our
state
supreme
court.
they
said
the
same
thing
to
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
it
would
be
no
more
appropriate
for
us
to
certify
it.
the
same
reasons
would
apply,
but
you've
just
asked
us
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it,
of
course,
because
it
wasn't
in
arizonans.
in
arizonans,
the
state
attorney
general
had
offered
a
limited
construction
that
would
remain
within
constitutional
bounds,
and
then
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
no,
we
can't
read
the
statute
that
way.
we
read
the
statute
as,
in
covering
much
more
than
the
attorney
general
is
arguing,
and
therefore
it's
unconstitutional.
so
whatever
we
say
about
our
accounting
with
respect
to
federal
legislation,
certainly
we
can't
say
what
the
state
can
do
with
its
own
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
stenberg,
i
thought
that
casey
indicated
that
there
were
two
interests
throughout
pregnancy,
and
one
is
the
health
of
the
woman
and
the
other
is
the
potential
life
of
the
fetus.
and
whatever
this
particular
ban
does,
it
certainly
can't
be
urged
that
it
is
passed
in
the
interests
of
the
health
of
the
woman,
and
it
doesn't
serve
the
interests
of
the
potential
life
of
the
fetus,
because
it
just
says,
as
you
said,
there's
always
another
way
to
do
it.
so
it
doesn't
serve
either
of
the
purposes
that
we
recognized
in
casey
as
central,
and
therefore
seems
to
be
out
of
the
balance
that
this
court
set
for
legitimate
pre-viability
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
indeed
wasn't
that
the
purpose
that
the
state
put
forward,
that
by
giving
an
interval,
the
woman
might
change
her
mind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
quite
clearly
was
intended
to
serve
the...
what
the
court
described
as
the
interest
in
the
potential
life
of
the
fetus.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
heller,
what
isn't
part
of
this
statute...
all
of
this
dispute
would
be
out
of
the
case
if
the
legislature
had
simply
said,
we
ban
d&x
and
not
d&e.
and
to
me
it's...
it's...
that's
just
glaring
here
that
they
could
have
reduced
all
question
of
ambiguity
if
they
had
simply
said
we
ban
a
term
that
the
doctors
call
d&x
and
we
don't
ban
d&e.
is
there
any
explanation
why
they
didn't
simply
say
if
they
meant
to
cut
out
d&x,
d&x
is
banned?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
they
just
say
that,
general
stenberg?
why
didn't
they
just...
i
mean,
that
was
proposed,
mr.
heller
told
us...
say
that
what's
banned
is
d&x,
what's
not
banned
is
d&e?
that
was
such
a
simple
way
of
clarifying
it.
why
didn't
they
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
medical...
american
medical
association
recommend
this
text
or
did
they
simply
say,
in
our
judgment,
it's
okay
to
ban
d&x?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
there
any
question
that
they
would
have
supported
a
ban
that
simply
said
what
you
tell
me
the
legislature
meant,
that
is,
we
ban
d&x
and
nothing
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
just
be
saying
that
the
ama
liked
this
other
text.
is
there
anything
in
the
world
to
indicate
that
they
wouldn't
have
preferred
the
clarity
that
we
ban
d&x
would
have
brought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
medical
term.
is
there
any
reasonable
doubt
that
a
doctor
would
say...
a
medical
term
is
what
doctors
use.
are
you
suggesting
that
any
legislator
in...
in
the
state
was
genuinely
in
doubt,
whether
if
he
had
used
d&x,
the
medical
association
would
have
disapproved?
