does
the
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
nebraska
issue
rulings
or
opinion
letters?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
outside
of
this
litigation,
has
your
office
or
the
attorney
general's
office
in
nebraska
taken
a
formal
position
that
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
d&e
procedure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
this
litigation,
but
not...
in
no
other
form
and
in
no
other
venue
have
you
made
that
statement
or
that
representation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
you
describe
these
two
procedures,
which
in
your
view
seem
to
come
close
together,
the
american
medical
association
and
the
association
of
american
physicians
and
surgeons
are
just
confused
on
this
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as...
as
determined
by
the
individual
physician.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
are
certain
objective
standards
that
the
profession
as
a
whole
can
adopt
and...
and
recommend
to
the
courts.
is
that
not
true?
