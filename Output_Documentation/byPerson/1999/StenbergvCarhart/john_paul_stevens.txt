justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general,
isn't
the
bright
line
between
infanticide
and
abortion
at
the...
a
claim
of
viability?
isn't
that
the
statute
that
draws
that
bright
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
draw
that
bright
line,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
that
is
a
bright
line
that
separates
post
viability
from
pre-viability
abortions,
since
one
is
legal
and
the
other
is
illegal,
under
nebraska
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general
stenberg,
in
the
very
first
paragraph
of
the
judge's
opinion
it
says,
i
do
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
law
is
facially
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
held
it
invalid
as
to
this
doctor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
injunction
is
just
limited
to
against
this
doctor
and
his
patients,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
that
the
injunction
only
applies
to
this
doctor
and
his
patients?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
let's
assume
your
construction
of
the
statute
is
correct,
and
then
the
question
is
whether,
could
the
state
ban
just
d&x,
and
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
said
you
don't
need
this
procedure
in
substance.
but
i
notice
in
their
brief
they
have
a
sentence,
depending
on
the
physician's
skill
and
experience,
the
d&x
procedure
can
be
the
most
appropriate
abortion
procedure
for
some
women
in
some
circumstances,
and
then
they
have
a
footnote
to
the...
a
finding
of
the
district
court
that
there
are
at
least
10
to
20
nebraska
women
each
year
for
whom
the
d&x
is
the
most
appropriate
procedure.
now,
do
we
have
to
disagree
with
that
finding
to
hold
this
statute
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
can
ban
the
most
appropriate
procedure
for
a
small
number
of
women?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
do
we
have
to
find
that
finding
erroneous
in
order
to
sustain
your
position?
