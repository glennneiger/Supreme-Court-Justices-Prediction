justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stenberg,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
of
nebraska
could
also
prohibit
the
dilation
and
evacuation
procedure
for
pre-viability
abortions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just
wanted
your
position.
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that's
the
position
you
take,
but
it
is
difficult
to
read
the
statute
and
be
certain
that
that
is
so.
they're
both
rather
gruesome
procedures,
but
in
fact
one
may
be
very
similar
to
the
other--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
i'm
not
certain
whether
the
statute
might
not
prohibit
the
d&e
procedure
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stenberg,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
there
is
no
exception
under
this
statute,
as
i
read
it,
for
exceptions
for
the
health
of
the
woman,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
no
testimony
to
the
effect
that
there
might
be
circumstances
in
which
the
health
of
the
woman
required
d&x
versus
d&e?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
saying
it
for
the
first
time
to
this
court.
