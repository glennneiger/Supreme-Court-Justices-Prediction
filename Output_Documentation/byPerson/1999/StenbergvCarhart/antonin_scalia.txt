justice
antonin
scalia
general
stenberg,
i
took
it
that
what
you
meant
when
you
said
it
bordered
on
infanticide
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
viability
of
the
fetus,
but
that
the
procedure
looks
more
like
infanticide--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
the
child
is
killed
outside
the
womb
than
when
it
is
killed
inside
the
womb,
and
therefore
it
can
coarsen
public
perception
to
other
forms
of
killing
fetuses
or
children
outside
the
womb.
is
that
not
what
the
legislature
was
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
other
side
ask
for
it
to
be
certified?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
a
court
was
going
to
reach
that
resolution
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
for
a
court
to
certify
it,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
interpreted
the
way
you
say
it
should
be
interpreted,
it
would
be
wrong,
i
think,
for
the
court
to
ask
for
certification.
justice
antonin
scalia
should
certify
it
only
if
that
makes
a
difference
to
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
acknowledge
that
we
also
should
not
certify
if,
even,
we
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
we
think
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
we
interpret
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
always
certify
state
questions
to
the
state
courts,
especially
when
there's
only
one
interpretation
that
would
render
the
statute
constitutional
and
another
one
to
render
it
unconstitutional.
it
isn't
the
federal
law
that
we
must
certify
to
state
courts,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
just,
what
does
a
waiting...
a
24-hour
waiting
period,
how
does
that
affect
either
of
those
two
interests?
justice
antonin
scalia
either
the
health
of
the...
you
know,
the
potential
viability
of
the
fetus
or
the
health
of
the
mother?
doesn't
that
have
another
interest
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
state
interest
that
it
protects
is
certainly
not
a
state
interest
in
either
the
health
of
the
mother
or
the
viability,
the
potential
viability
of
the
fetus,
is
it,
the
24-hour
wait?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
totally
different
state
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
must
say
i
don't
understand...
i
don't
understand
that
conclusion.
the
statute
prohibits
a
procedure
in
which
the
person
performing
the
abortion
partially
delivers
vaginally
a
living,
unborn
child
before
killing
the
unborn
child
and
completing
the
delivery.
now,
how
does
that
occur
in
d&e?
as
i
understand
what
happens
in
d&e
sometimes
is
that
they...
is
that
they...
is
your
argument
that
in
breaking
off
a
leg
and
dismembering
the
fetus
inside
the
womb,
when
you...
when
you
pull
the
leg
out
of
the
womb,
that
amounts
to
delivering,
partially
delivering
a
living,
unborn
child?
pulling
out
a...
a
torn-off
leg
is...
is
delivering
a
living,
unborn
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
order
to...
for
the
purpose
of
killing
it,
partially
delivers...
the
term
partially
delivers
a
living...
the
unborn
child
means
deliberately
and
intentionally
delivering
into
the
vagina
a
living,
unborn
child.
now,
in...
in
a
d&e,
does...
is
that
what
the...
is
that
what
the
physician
tries
to
do,
tries
to
intentionally
deliver
into
the
vagina
a
living,
unborn
child
for
the
purpose
of...
of
then
killing
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
understanding
of
the
d&e
at
all.
my
understanding
is
that...
that
you...
you
try
to
dismember
it
if
possible
before
the
delivery.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
has
to
be
more
than
just
bringing
it.
it
has
to
be
the
object
of
the
physician
to
do
it
that
way.
and
i
do
not
understand
it
to
be
the
case
that
this
is
what
you
set
out
to
do
when
you
do
a
d&e.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that?
will
you
give
us
the
citation
in
the
record?
i
did
not
understand
that
to
be
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they...
they
describe
it
as
a
form
of
de...
d&e
not
in
that,
like
d&e,
it
involves
partial
birth
of
the
child.
that
isn't
the
respect
in
which
they
say
it's
a
form
of
d&e.
justice
antonin
scalia
ultimately,
yes,
but
not...
not
always
intact
and
not
always
alive.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
would
you
be
able
to
do
a
d&e
and...
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the
d&x
is
only
possible
90
to
95
percent
of
the
time
that
he
attempts
it.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
he's...
i'm
sorry.
just
the
opposite.
it's
not
possible
to
do
it
90
to
95.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
it
impossible?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if...
if
you
can
do
it
and
if
that...
if
that's
the
same
thing
you
do
for
d&e,
then
i
don't
understand
any
difference
at
all
between
the
two
procedures.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just...
just
tell
me
what
it
means
to
say
that...
that
90
percent
of
the
time
he
can't
do
a
d&x,
but
he
can
do
a
d&e?
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
mean
he
cannot
get
out
a
substantial
portion
of
the
living
fetus.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
that,
but
if
it
means
something
other
than
that,
then
i...
it
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me.
he
can
say
that
he
can
do
a
d&x
only
10
percent
of
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
medical
testimony
certainly
acknowledges
a
general
understanding
of
a
difference
between
d&x
and
d&e.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
put
the
question
differently.
the
medical
testimony
certainly
establishes
that
there
is
a
distinctive
form
of
procedure
known
as
d&x.
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
call
it
a
variation,
whatever.
it's
a
distinctive
procedure.
people
talk
about
d&x.
we've
been
talking
about
it
today--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
though
it
is
something
distinctive.
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
only
question
is
whether
this
statute
covers
only
that
distinctive
procedure
or
something
beyond
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
agree
that
that
distinctive
procedure
is
also
generally
called
partial-birth
abortion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
that
term
is
not
normally
applied
to
d&e?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
asking
whether
there's
a
medical
definition.
is...
is
the
term
partial-birth
abortion
not
normally
applied
to
what
we've
been
discussing
as
d&x?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
find
to
the
contrary,
would...
would
you
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
statute
does
begin
partial-birth
abortion
means
an
abortion
procedure
in
which,
and
then
goes
on,
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
the
title.
it's
part
of
the
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
it
depends
upon
how
significant
the
health
interest
is.
if...
if
there
is
an
insignificant
difference
between...
between
using
d&x
and
using
d&e,
which...
which
some
of
the
medical
testimony
seems
to
indicate,
you're
saying
that
there's
no
interest
whatever
in...
in
the
state
in...
in
preventing
the
coarsening
of
manners
from...
from
having
the
doctor
and
those
in
attendance
and
those
who
know
what
goes
on
witnessing
the...
the
destruction
of
a...
of
a
live
human
creature
outside
the
womb?
there's
no
state
interest
in
that
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
destroy
the
fetus
after
it's
born
if
it's
viable.
right?
we...
we
do
make
the...
the
distinction
at
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
roe...
roe...
neither
roe
nor
casey
are
written
in
the
constitution.
they
may
not
have
mentioned
all
of
the...
all
of
the
appropriate
interests
that
may
be
taken
into
account.
why
is
it
not
an
appropriate
interest
that
the
state
is
worried
about
rendering
society
callous
to
infanticide?
there
were
very
many
highly
civilized
societies,
including
the
ancient
greeks,
who
permitted
infanticide,
who
said
that
the
right
of
parents
included
the
right
not
to
be
burdened
with
a
child
they
didn't
want,
especially
a
deformed
child.
and
therefore,
in
order
to
prevent
other
societies
descending
into
that
degree
of
callousness,
the...
the
numerous
states
that
have
enacted
these
laws...
i
don't
think
it's
so
much
a
concern
with...
with
medical
matters.
i
think
it's
a
concern
with
the
horror
of
seeing,
you
know,
a...
a
live
human
creature
outside
the
womb
dismembered.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
that
be
a
valid
societal
interest--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
it's
expressed
in
roe
and
casey
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
we
can
look
forward
to
this
being
more
widespread
in
the
years
to
come.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
when
you
have
a...
a
fully
viable
fetus
that
no
state
restrictions
upon...
upon
the
woman's
right
to
abort
could
involve
any
risk
whatever
to
the
woman's
health?
there
has
to
be
a
health
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
any...
any
risk
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
the
slightest
risk
whatever,
the...
the
state
must
allow
the
woman
to
dispose
of
a
fully
viable
fetus.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
it...
it's
possible
that
there
is
a
similar
rule
applicable
here,
that
the
state
may
not
impose
significant
health
risks
upon
the
woman.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
can't
be,
you
know,
a
minimal,
virtually
nonexistent
health
risk,
which
is
what
your
argument
assumes,
that
you
cannot
have
any...
any
risk
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
another
district
court
makes
a
different
finding?
i
mean,
do...
do
we
accept
the
district
court's
findings
on
these
general
medical
questions
as
binding?
is
it...
is
it
binding
just
in
this
case?
or
if
we
have
another
abortion
case
from
another...
from
another
circuit
where
the
district
judge
makes
a
different
conclusion,
the...
the
nonmedical
district
judge,
do...
do
we
then
accept
that
other
conclusion
too?
