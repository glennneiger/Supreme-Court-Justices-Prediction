unknown

general
stenberg,
one
of
the
authorities
that
you
cited
for
deference
was
the
arizonan's
case
where
there
was
a
formal
opinion
of
the
state
attorney
general,
and
yet
when
that
case
was
ultimately
decided
by
the
state's
own
supreme
court,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
they
rejected
the
formal
opinion
of
the
state
attorney
general,
so
i
think
you
can
say
that
you
deserve
respectful
consideration,
but
no
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
stenberg.
mr.
heller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
what
made
it
impossible
is
the
inability
to
take
out
the...
the
fetus
from
the
vagina
intact
and
still
alive.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
that's
the
rule?
