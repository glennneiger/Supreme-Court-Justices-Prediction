mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
roe
v.
wade,
this
court
said
that
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
at
whatever
time,
in
whatever
way,
and
for
whatever
reason
a
woman
chooses.
with
that
legal
principle,
and
the
casey
undue
burden
test
in
mind,
the
issue
here
today
is
whether
a
state
may
prohibit
a
little-used
form
of
abortion
that
borders
on
infanticide
when
safe,
alternative
forms
of
abortion
remain
available
to
women
who
seek
abortions.
clearly,
the
state
can
constitutionally
ban
some
abortion
procedures.
for
example,
the
state
can
unquestionably
prohibit
an
abortion
procedure
that
is
unsafe
for
the
woman's
health.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
that...
the
statute
would
cover
both
pre-viability
and
post
viability,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
was
the
legislature's
observation
that,
whether
viable
or
not,
that
it's
important--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--yes.
that's
because
the
district
judge...
because
dr.
carhart
testified
that
he
did
not
perform
post
viability
partial
birth
abortions,
and
therefore
the
federal
judge
did
not
need
to
rule
on
the
post-viability
aspect
of
the
statute.
the
statute
itself
covers--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--covers
both,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
yes.
there
is
a
separate
statute
that
prohibits
all
post
viability
abortions
except
to
save
the
life
or
for
the
health
of
the
mother.
that
is
under
another
statute.
but
i
believe,
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
state
interest
here
is
drawing
a
bright
line
between
infanticide
and
abortion,
and
that's
such
a
strong
state
interest
that
30
states
in
our
nation
have
addressed
this
issue
and
have
voted
to
ban
that
procedure.
in
fact,
in
nebraska
the
sentiment
was
so
strong
on
the
state
interest
to
draw
a
bright
line
between
infanticide--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--i
think
that
30
states--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
that
would
be
a
line.
that's
not
the
bright
line,
however,
that
the
legislature
drew
in
this
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
that
is
under
one
nebraska
statute,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
legislature
has
also
been
concerned
about
the
partial
birth
abortion
procedure
which
led
to
the
passage
of
this
particular
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
that
is
precisely
the
point,
your
honor,
and
that
is
precisely
what
motivated
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
nebraska
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
state
interest
here
was
so
strong
that
the
statute
passed
the
nebraska
legislature
with
only
one
dissenting
vote,
with
many
pro-choice
state
legislators
voting
in
favor
of
this
ban
on
partial
birth
abortion.
now,
the
respondent
argues
that
drawing
a
bright
line
between
abortion
and
infanticide
is
not
a
valid
state
interest.
the
respondent
argues
that
there
are
only
two
valid
state
interests,
one
being
maternal
health
and
the
other
essentially
discouraging
abortions.
however,
casey
specifically
recognized
that
other
state
interests
could
be
weighed
as
part
of
the
undue
burden
test,
and
at
505
u.s.
877
the
court
said,
quote,
a
statute
which,
while
furthering
this
interest
in
potential
life
or
some
other
valid
state
interest,
and
then
goes
on
to
describe
the
substantial
obstacle
test,
so
the
court
recognized
that
there
could
be
other
state
interests
besides
merely
maternal
health
and
discouraging
abortions.
now,
the
respondent
next
argues
that
even
if
there
is
a
valid
state
interest,
that
it
can
only
be
asserted
if
it
creates
no
burden
on
a
woman's
right
to
have
an
abortion.
the
respondent
implicitly
asks
this
court
to
adopt
a
no-burden
test,
or
perhaps
reestablish
a
strict
scrutiny
test
in
place
of
casey.
the
respondent
argues
that,
under
the
no-burden
test
that
any
state
regulation
which
increases
the
health
risk
to
a
woman
by
even
the
slightest
amount
is
unconstitutional.
this
is
contrary
to
casey,
which
held...
which
upheld
the
24-hour
waiting
period
because
it
did
not
create,
quote,
a
real
health
risk,
unquote,
or
a,
quote,
a
significant
threat,
unquote,
to
the
health
of
a
woman.
the
respondent
also
asks
this
court
to
in
effect
adopt
an
all-or-nothing
test
in
place
of
the
large
fraction
test
to
judge
the
facial
constitutionality
of
abortion
restrictions.
in
other
words,
the
respondent
argues
that
unless
a
statute
is
constitutional
in
every
conceivable
application,
it
must
be
struck
down
as
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
this
was
pled
as
a
facial
challenge.
there's
some
language
in
the
district
court
decision
as
being
applied.
however,
the
state
has
never
applied
this
statute.
this
lawsuit
was
filed
within
2
or
3
or
4
days
after
the
statute
took
effect.
the
state
has
never
had
a
chance
to
attempt
to
apply
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
understand...
and
i
mention--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--and
frankly
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
district
court
was
simply
wrong
in
its
characterization
of
this
case.
the
state
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
apply
the
statute
to--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--i
think
what
the
district
court
may
have
had
in
mind--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
and
similarly
situated
individuals,
is
the
way
i
believe
the
court's
order
read,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
it
seems...
my
reading
of
the
circuit
court
was
that
they
viewed
it
as
an
applied...
or,
excuse
me,
as
a
facial
challenge.
i
think
what
the
district
judge
may
have
thought
when
he
said,
as
applied,
he
may
have
meant
as
applied
to
pre-viability
abortions,
drawing
the
distinction
that
dr.
carhart
testified
that
he
doesn't
do
post
viability
abortions.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
under...
under
danforth,
your
honor,
that
was
still--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
state's
position
would
be
that
the
state
could
not
prohibit
the
d&e
procedure,
but
also
the
state
has
not
attempted
to
prohibit
the
d&e
procedure.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
it
does
not
prohibit
the
d&e
procedure,
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
question
first
from
a,
kind
of
an
institutional
standpoint
and
then
turn
specifically
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
in
the
absence
of
a
decision
interpreting
this
law
by
our
state
supreme
court,
the
foremost
legal
authority
on
the
proper
interpretation
of
state
law
is
the
office
of
the
state
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general
interprets
the
law,
gives
legal
advice
to
state
agencies,
the
governor,
our
administrative
agencies,
appears
in
state
court
every
week,
appears
before
the
nebraska
supreme
court
virtually
every
time
that
it's
in
session
interpreting
and
arguing
points
of
state
law.
a
u.s.
district
court,
by
comparison,
spends
most
of
its
time
dealing
with
issues
of
federal
constitutional
law
and
federal
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
we
do,
your
honor.
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
we
were
not
asked,
while
this
statute
was
in
the
legislative
process,
to
issue
an
interpretation.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
there
are
approximately
20
of
these
cases
in
various
stages
in
various
federal
courts
throughout
the
nation
and,
at
least
so
far
as
my
staff
can
determine,
no
state
attorney
general
has
interpreted
this
law
or
similar
laws
in
their
own
states
to
ban
the
d&e
procedure.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
guess
my
point
is,
is
that
for
the
court
to
do
that,
this
court
would
have
to
essentially
tell
the
attorneys
general
of
approximately
20
states
that
each
and
every
one
of
them
misunderstood
and
misinterpreted
their
own
state
law,
even
though
that
is
their
principal
business
day-in
and
day-out,
year-in
and
year-out.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
our
formal
position
was
taken
in
the
context
of
this
litigation,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
your
honor,
but
i
would
strongly
recommend
to
this
court--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
necessary
here
because
the
d&e
procedure
remains
available
any
time
there
is
a
health
problem,
and
that
procedure
is
available
to--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--there
was...
there
was
testimony
that
i
would
regard
as
speculation,
your
honor,
but
both
the
american
medical
association
and
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
have
studied
this
issue
and
said
that
they
could
not
identify
a
single
circumstance
when
a...
in
which
a
partial
birth
abortion,
or
a
d&x
abortion
would
be
the
only
procedure
available
to
save
the
life--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--i
think
from
a
legal
standpoint
it
does
apply.
i
think
the
legislature
acted,
as
legislative
bodies
do,
as
part
of
a
political
compromise,
as
part
of
a,
perhaps
an
effort
to
be
particularly
careful
when
the
life
of
the
woman
was
involved,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
have
been
necessary
in
order
to
have
a
constitutional
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
oh,
i
think
the
medical
opinion
is
divided,
your
honor,
and
i
think
what
this
court
should
do
when
the
medical
opinion
is
divided
is
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
state
legislative
body,
which
is
the
proper
fact-finder
when
we're
dealing
with--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is,
is
that
the...
even
the
experts
who
testified
for
dr.
carhart
here,
that
of
the
60
or
so
doctors
who
have
testified
in
these
partial-birth
abortion
cases
all
across
the
country,
only
about
three
could
be
identified
as
actually
performing
this
procedure
themselves.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
conclude,
as
a
legislative
policy
matter,
that
there
are
only...
that
almost
60
of
these
doctors
are
not
properly
caring,
or
significantly
creating
a
health
risk
for
their
women
who
are
patients.
this
is
a
practice
that
is
not
used
even
by
most
abortionists
in
the
united
states,
and
so
it's
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
there
is
any
health
risk
when
both
acog
and
the
american
medical
association
specifically
found
that
there
are
always
alternatives
available
to
a
woman
in
need
of
abortion
if
there
is
a
health
concern.
but
to
return
briefly
to
the
overall
picture
of
statutory
construction,
i
would
strongly
recommend
that
this
court
adopt
the
corollary
proposed
in
the
friend
of
the
court
brief
authored
by
the
state
of
virginia,
which
basically
says
that
when
a
federal
court
is
faced
with
a
state
statute
that
has
not
been
construed
by
the
state's
highest
court,
that
the
federal
court
either
defer
to
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
or...
of
the
state,
or,
if
the
court
is
unwilling,
or
finds
that
that
would
not
be
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
law,
to
certify
the
question
to
the
state
supreme
court,
because
that
way--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
in
our
answer
we...
no,
we
did
not.
we
did
ask
the
court
in
our
answer
to
the
complaint
to
abstain
so
that
the
state
courts
could
hear
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
there
was
a
conversation--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
we
did
ask
for
abstention,
but
i
suppose
that--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--not
to
my
knowledge.
there
was
a
discussion,
your
honor,
in
closing
arguments
between
mr.
heller,
counsel
for
dr.
carhart,
and
the
district
judge,
closing
arguments
on
the
preliminary
injunction,
and
judge
kopf
brought
up
the
issue
of
certification,
and
mr.
heller
did
not
strongly
object,
but
his
argument
was
that
that
would
not
resolve
the
controversy,
that
even
if
the
state
supreme
court
would
narrow
the
construction
to
d&x
the
statute
was
still
unconstitutional,
and
that
therefore
the
controversy
would
not
be
resolved
by
referring
it
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
in
essence
suggested,
therefore,
that
the
district
court
proceed.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
if
it
was
going
to
decide
that
the
d&x
was
unconstitutional
there
would
be
no
reason--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
precisely
right,
and
in
essence
judge
kopf
commented,
not
in
those
words,
but
generally
to
that
effect.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
no,
your
honor.
if
this
court
is
going
to
construe
nebraska's
statute
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
it
is
limited
to
d&x...
or,
excuse
me,
that
it
includes
d&e,
then
you
should
certify
it,
but
if--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--only
if
it
makes
a
difference.
if
this--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--yes,
that's
correct.
if--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--yes.
the
state's
position
is,
this
statute
bans
the
d&x
procedure.
if
this
court
feels
that
ban
is
unconstitutional,
then
there
would
be
no
need
to
certify
that
question.
but
if
the
question
is,
does
this
statute
ban
the
d&e
procedure
or
not,
and
this
court
is
uncertain
on
that,
then
it
should
certify
that
question
to
the
state
supreme
court,
rather
than,
in
my
opinion
at
least,
incorrectly
interpret
nebraska's
own
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
statute
might
be
amenable
to
more
than
one
construction,
but
we
believe
that
the
state's
construction
is
a
reasonable
one.
it's
one
that
would
uphold,
hopefully
uphold
the
cons--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--yes,
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
of
course
the
rule
that
is
followed
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
as
well.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
state
certification
rule
offered
by
the
state
of
virginia
removes
the
federal
court
from
a
source
of
friction
with
the
states
by
either
accepting
the
interpretation
placed
on
the
statute
by
the
attorney
general,
or
certifying
to
the
state
supreme--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--no,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
only
suggest
certification
if
the
court
places...
it
would
place
a
different
interpretation
on
the
statute
than
placed
on
it
by
the
state
attorney
general.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
you
need
to
accept
that
the
legislature
could
consider
all
of
the
competing--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
i
don't...
i
believe
that
the
district
court
was
simply
erroneous--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
dr.
carhart
testified
that
he
attempts
approximately
200
d&x
abortions
a
year,
but
only
successfully
completes
10
or
20
of
them,
and
a
procedure
that
is
completed
so
rarely,
and
that
is
practiced
so
rarely
across
the
united
states,
even
by
persons
in
the
practice
of
abortion,
simply
prohibiting
that
procedure
can
simply
not
be
considered
to
present
any
significant
threat
to
a
woman's
health
if
that
procedure's
not
available.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
think
the
overwhelming
weight
of
medical
judgment,
as
opposed
to
the
district
court
judge's
view,
comes
from
the
american
medical
association
and
acog
that
this
particular
procedure
is
never
necessary
to
save
the
life
or
preserve
the
health
of
the
woman.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
under
casey,
your
honor,
if
the
test
were
a
no-burden
test,
or
if
there
could
be
not
even
the
smallest
possible
health
consideration,
then
casey
would
have
come
out
differently
on
the
24-hour
waiting
period.
the
whole
concept
of
undue
burden
is
the
word,
undue,
and
it
seems
the
respondent
wants
to
argue
here
for
a
no-burden
test,
so
the--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
my
argument
when
i
quoted
from
casey,
the
court
in
very
general
terms
recognized
other
state
interests,
presumably
to
be
recognized
and
defined
in
subsequent
case
law,
and
i
believe
that
case
is
now
here.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
there
was--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--there
was
testimony
in
the
casey
decision,
recorded
in
the
casey
decision
about,
that
the
24-hour
waiting
period
might
require
more
travel.
it
might,
in
fact,
lead
to
delays
of
more
than
24
hours,
that
any
delay
leads
to
some
theoretical
increase,
the
passage
of
each
day--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--no.
that
was...
that--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
yes,
that
is...
that
is...
or,
i
think...
i
would...
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
think
it--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--yes.
it
could
lead
the
mother
to
decide--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
might
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
on
may
20th,
1997,
the
nebraska
legislature
adopted
an
amendment
that
was
proposed
to
congress
by
the
american
medical
association
for
the
purpose
of
making
clear
that
the
statute
did
not
prohibit
the
d&e
procedure.
and
the
best
discussion
of
that
can
be
found
on
page
418
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
because
the
nebraska
legislature
was
relying
on
the
american
medical
association
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
patterned
their
legislation
on
that.
and
they
felt
that
if
this
gained
the
support
of
the
american
medical
association
and
congress,
which
it
did
for
the
1997
law,
that
they
wanted
to
pattern
that
and
rely
on
the
american
medical
association
and
their
lawyers
and
congressional
lawyers.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no.
they
did...
they
did
both.
they...
they...
what
they
said
is
if
the
congress
would
adopt
these
amendments,
which
were
the
same
as...
as
what
nebraska
adopted,
that
they
would
then
support
the
ban
on
d&x
abortion.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
there's...
of
course,
there's
more
than
one
way
to
achieve
the
same
result,
your
honor.
the
nebraska
legislature
chose
to--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
of
course,
viewed
from,
i
think,
the
standpoint
of
a
state
senator
in...
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
they're
not
really
in
a
position
to
go
to
the
ama
and
say,
well,
is
there
some
other
language
that
might
be
just
as
good?
they
just
took
what
was
given
to
them.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
there
was
some
doubt
because
in
1997
there
were
several
terms
used
to
describe
this
procedure,
the
d&x,
the
intact
d&e,
the
intact
d&x,
and
the
haskell
d&x.
so,
there
were
several
different,
quote,
medical
terms
that
were
being
applied
in
1997,
and
the
legislature
chose
to
attack
it
by...
by
describing
the
procedure
rather
than
using
a
medical
term,
which
i
believe
the
legislature
is
free
to
do.
on
this
question
of
what
is
a
d&e,
dr.
carhart
addressed
that
in
his
complaint
on
paragraph
30
in
which
he
pled,
the
intact
removal
of
the
fetus--
