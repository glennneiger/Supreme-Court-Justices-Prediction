mr.
simon
heller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
nebraska
statute
before
this
court
aims
to
eliminate
the
two
central
principles
of
roe
v.
wade
and
planned
parenthood
v.
casey.
it
seeks
to
reverse
the
supremacy
of
women's
health
over
fetal
interests
throughout
pregnancy,
and
it
seeks
to
replace
the
viability
line
established
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
a
new
line,
one
based
on
the
location
of
the
fetus
inside
the
woman's
body.
i
want
to
focus
on
three
main
reasons
that
the
nebraska
ban
is
unconstitutional.
first,
it's
so
broadly
written
that
it
could
prohibit
most
second
trimester
abortions
as
they
are
performed
in
nebraska
today.
mr.
simon
heller
yes.
mr.
simon
heller
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
principle
is...
only
holds
where
the
two
alternative
constructions
are
both
reasonable.
in
this
case,
the
standard
canons
of
statutory
construction,
those
applied
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
and
this
court,
all
indicate
that
the
nebraska
statute
is
much
broader
than
a
prohibition
just
on
the
d&x
technique.
first,
its
plain
language
describes
the
elements
of
most
second
trimester
abortion
procedures,
in
particular
the
dilation
and
evacuation
method,
as
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found.
and
they
found
that
based
not
simply
on
this
text
of
the
statute,
but
the
text
of
the
statute
interpreted
in
light
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
both
the
witnesses
for
dr.
carhart
and
the
state's
own
witnesses
who
acknowledged
that
this
statute
could
be
broad
enough
to
prohibit--
mr.
simon
heller
--that's
correct.
mr.
simon
heller
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
their
authority
to
speak
to
the
construction
of
the
statute,
but
describing
how
abortion
procedures
actually
occur
and
how
they
are
performed
and
then
comparing
that
to
the
language
of
the
statute
to
see
if
the
steps
that
occur
in
abortion--
mr.
simon
heller
--no.
the...
the
court
did.
the
court
relied
on
the
descriptions
of
abortion
procedures
by
the
witnesses.
mr.
simon
heller
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
are
quite
clear
that
the
way
the
d&e
typically
occurs
is
that
the
physician
partially
delivers
the
intact,
living
fetus
into
the
vagina
while
it...
before
fetal
demise
has
occurred,
so
that
there
is
a
living,
unborn
child
partially
in
the
uterus
and
partially
outside
the
uterus.
mr.
simon
heller
yes.
mr.
simon
heller
in
every
pre-viability--
mr.
simon
heller
--that's
not
what
the
district
court
found.
all
the
expert
testimony
shows
that
to...
if
the
physician
were
to
attempt
to
induce
fetal
demise
while
the
fetus
is
still
in
the
uterus,
that
would
impose
increased
health
risks
on
the
woman.
and
that's
really
what
this
case
is
about.
it's
about
shifting
the
location
of
the
abortion
procedure
into
the
uterus
at
the
expense
of
women's
health.
mr.
simon
heller
that's
right.
in
fact,
in
the
majority
of
the
cases--
mr.
simon
heller
--that's
right.
that...
that
the
way
a
d&e
is
performed
matches
the
statutory
elements.
in
fact,
the
attorney
general
of
nebraska
told
the
district
court
that
anytime
a
living
fetus
is
brought
part
way
into
the
vagina,
before
fetal
demise
has
occurred,
and
is
then
killed
by
some
step,
that
that
constitutes
a--
mr.
simon
heller
--actually
dr.
carhart,
in
each
second
trimester
abortion
by
d&e
that
he
performs,
sets
out
to
bring
as
much
of
the
fetus
out
of
the
uterus
at
once
as
possible
because
it
reduces
risks
to...
to
the
women.
it
reduces
the
risks
of
uterine
perforation
and
infection.
mr.
simon
heller
so,
his
intention
is
always
to
do
that,
if
possible.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
the
american
medical
association
described
the
d&x
technique
as
a
form
of
d&e.
it
is
in
the
record
in
their
report
on
abortion
that's
in
the
record.
they
describe
the
d&x
technique
as
a
form
of
d&e,
and
that's
because
it
basically
involves
the
same
steps
as
a
d&e.
it
involves
the
same
procedure
of
delivering
the
fetus
vaginally.
and
pre-viability,
that
inevitably
results
in
fetal
demise.
mr.
simon
heller
certainly.
the
citation
occurs
in
exhibit
7,
which
is
on
pages
482
through
500
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
particular,
on
page
492
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
ama
report
calls
the
d&x
method
a
form
of
d&e
and,
in
fact,
goes
on
to
state...
the
ama
states
further
that
the
d&x
technique
may
be
preferred
by
some
physicians
precisely
because
it
reduces
risks
to
the
woman.
that's
the
opinion
of
the
american
medical
association,
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
specialty
group,
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
established
that
in
all
d&e's
the
fetus
is
brought
through
the
vagina
and
out
of
the
woman's
body.
that's
how
the
abortion--
mr.
simon
heller
--typically
intact
and
alive.
those
are
the
findings
in
the
district
court,
and
that's
what
dr.
carhart
does
in
most
of
the
d&e
abortions
he
performs,
including
those
in
which
he's
able
to
perform
the
d&x
technique.
so,
that's
one
reason
that
we
believe
the
statute
encompasses
the
d&e
method.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
it's
possible
about...
he
is
able
to
do
it
about
10
percent
of
the
time.
mr.
simon
heller
right.
mr.
simon
heller
well--
mr.
simon
heller
--there
are
a
variety
of
factors
that
determine
how
exactly
a
physician,
whether
it's
dr.
carhart
of
any
other
physician,
performs
the
d&e
when
you...
if
you
were
to
measure
what
parts
are
delivered
and
so
forth.
mr.
simon
heller
for
example,
insufficient
cervical
dilation
may
exist
so
that...
that
the
d&x
is
not
possible
because
there's
not
sufficient
cervical
dilation
to
perform
it.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
he--
mr.
simon
heller
--he
nevertheless
is
able
to,
in
almost
all
d&e's,
bring
a
substantial
portion
of
the
living
fetus
into
the
vagina
before
any
step
is
taken
that
causes
fetal
demise.
and
it's
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
here
that
substantial
portion
was
intended
to
be
very
broad
by
the
legislature.
the
chief
sponsor
wanted
to
accord
legal
protection
to
the
fetus
anytime
more
than
a
little
bit
of
the
fetus
was
brought
into
the
vagina.
mr.
simon
heller
the
medical
testimony
shows
that
they
are...
that
the
d&x
is
a
form
of
d&e.
it
has
certain
specific
elements,
the
same
way
as...
as
any
particular
type
of
surgery
might--
mr.
simon
heller
--there's
a
distinctive
variation
of
the
d&e
that's
called
d&x.
mr.
simon
heller
that's
right.
mr.
simon
heller
yes,
it
is.
mr.
simon
heller
that's
one
of
the
questions--
mr.
simon
heller
--well--
mr.
simon
heller
--no.
there
is
no...
first,
again
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
medical
definition
of
partial-birth
abortion.
mr.
simon
heller
no,
it's
not
normally
applied.
mr.
simon
heller
no.
mr.
simon
heller
no--
mr.
simon
heller
--no,
of
course,
because
the
title
of
the
statute
doesn't
control
its
meaning
in...
in
the
case
of
the
definition--
mr.
simon
heller
--or
in
case
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
there
is.
first,
they...
they
rejected
an
amendment
that
would
have
done
just
that.
secondly,
throughout
the
legislative
history,
it's
apparent
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
prohibit
the
d&x
technique,
but
also
to
prohibit
many
other
forms
of
abortion
in
which
the
living
fetus
was
brought
into
the
vagina
before
demise
was
caused.
that
was
their
intention.
indeed,
that's
the
purpose
that
mr.
stenberg
acknowledged
today,
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
accord
legal
protection
to
the
fetus
once
it's
emerged
from
the
womb.
but
even
if
this
statute
were
limited
to
the
d&x
technique
by
some
replacement
of
the
existing
definition
with,
say,
the
acog
definition
of
the
d&x
technique,
it's
nevertheless
unconstitutional
under
this
court's
precedents.
first,
under
both
casey
and
roe,
the
state
must
show
that
any
regulation
of
abortions
serves
one
of
the
two
recognized
interests,
maternal
health
or
potential
life.
there's
no
evidence
before
this
court--
mr.
simon
heller
--well,
there
is
language
in
casey
that
suggests
that
other
valid
state
interests
could
justify
regulation
of
abortion.
that's
absolutely
correct.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
two
recognized
interests
are
not
served.
i'll
turn
briefly
to
the...
the
new
interests
that
are
proposed.
there's
a
sort
of
a
laundry
list
of
about
seven
or
eight
new
interests
that
the
state
suggests
could
justify
a
prohibition
on
the
d&x
technique.
we
believe
none
of
those
is
sufficient
to
override
the
woman's
health.
for
example,
beginning
with
roe
and
on
through
casey,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
woman's
interest
in
her
health
and
in
her
bodily
integrity
overrides
the
state
interests
in
the
fetus
even
after
viability.
so,
it
follows
from
that
some...
the
subsidiary
interests
suggested
by
nebraska
showing
concern
for
potential
life,
showing
respect
for
potential
life...
they
certainly
can't
overcome
the
woman's
health
interests
and
the
woman's
interest
in
her
own
bodily
integrity.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
first,
the
district
court
found
that
a
prohibition
on
the
d&x
technique
would
impose
appreciable
risks
on
women,
and
that
follows
from
the
very
common
sense
findings
of
the
district
court
that
the
d&x
technique
reduces
instrumentation
in
the
uterus
and
reduces,
therefore,
the
risk
of
uterine
perforation
and
infection.
but
even
if
the
risks
were
less
than
appreciable,
anytime
a
state
prohibits
a
safe
abortion
technique,
it
is
prohibiting
a
technique
that
will
be
the
safest
for
some
women.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
coupled
with
that
the
very
strong
interests
the
woman
has
in
literally
declining
to
have
additional
intrusions
into
her
body
of
surgical
instruments.
this
is
the
sort
of
interest
that
this
court
in
glucksberg
recognized
as
having
special
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
we
have
a...
a
conjunction
of
strong
rights
here--
mr.
simon
heller
--that's
correct,
and
that's
a
distinction
that
this
court
made
in
roe
for
the
very
good
reason
that
once
the
fetus
is
outside
the
woman's
body,
her
right
to
control
her
own
body
is
no
longer
at
issue.
so,
here...
but
here
what
we're
talking
about
is
her
right
to
have
an
abortion
by
the
safest
possible
means.
and
there's...
there's
nothing
in
this
court's
precedents
that
suggests
that
that
right
can
be
overridden
by
any
sort
of
fetal
interest.
let
me
just
add
that
many
of
the
other
interests
suggested
by
the
state
have
no
support
in
the
record.
and
it
would...
we
believe
it's
appropriate
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
ask
this
court
to
recognize
new
valid
interests
that
can
override
constitutional
rights,
that
the
state
provide
some
evidence
at
least
that
one
of
those
interests
is
actually
promoted
by
the
statute.
let
me
take
one
example,
if
i
may,
the
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
medical
profession.
quite
to
the
contrary,
all
the
evidence
suggests
that
the
integrity
of
the
medical
profession
is
promoted
when
physicians
are
able
to
treat
their
patients
in
the
most
appropriate
and
safest
possible
manner.
so--
mr.
simon
heller
--as
determined
by
the
individual
physician
in
light
of
medical
standards
and
the
standards
of
the
medical
community.
mr.
simon
heller
that
is
true,
and
in...
in
this
instance,
both
the
specialty
group
of
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
and
the
ama
have
recognized
the
d&x
technique
is
the
most
appropriate
procedure
in
some
circumstances.
so,
with
the
weight
of
that
professional
support
behind
it,
we
believe
it's...
it
undermines
the
integrity
of
the
medical
profession
to
take
away
the
most
appropriate
procedure
in
a
particular
case.
in
fact,
most
of
the
evolution
in
safety
of
abortion
since
roe
has
been
due
to
the
protection
that's
been
accorded
to
the
physician's
judgment
about
how
to
carry
out
the
abortion
prior
to
viability.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
again,
let
me
start
by
saying
that--
mr.
simon
heller
--there's
certainly--
mr.
simon
heller
--there's
certainly
a
valid
state
interest
in
preventing
or
prohibiting
infanticide.
and
of
course,
nebraska,
like
virtually
every
other
state,
already
does
so
through
its
general
homicide
statutes,
so
that
nebraska
protects
the
fetus,
even
the
pre-viable
fetus,
if
it
has
an
independent
existence
from
the
woman.
but
to
say
that
an
abortion
procedure
that
is
safest
for
the
woman,
a
pre-viability
abortion
procedure,
is
so
horrific
and
so
like
infanticide,
any
of
the...
any
of
the
abortion
procedures...
that
could
be
said
about
any
abortion
procedure
because
every
abortion
procedure
pre-viability
involves
fetal
demise.
they
all
do.
this
is
an
interest
which,
if
recognized
and
if
it
could
override
the
woman's
right
to...
to
health
and
bodily
integrity,
would
authorize
states
to
prohibit
any
abortion
method
and
prohibit,
indeed,
all
abortions.
so
that
it's
irreconcilable
ultimately
with
the
right
recognized
in
roe
and
casey.
i
want
to
turn
also
to...
to
a
second
reason
that
the
d&x...
prohibition
on
the
d&x
technique
is
invalid
if,
indeed,
the
statute
could
be
so
limited.
and
that
is
the
recognition
in
casey
that
a
statute
which
has
the
purpose
of
imposing
an
undue
burden
on
the
woman's
right
to
obtain
a
pre-viability
abortion
is
also
invalid.
here
the
only
purpose
suggested,
indeed,
the
primary
purpose
identified
by
the
attorney
general
of
nebraska,
is
precisely
to
elevate
the
status
of
the
fetus
based
on
its
location
within
the
woman's
body,
not
in
its
location
once
it's
born,
not
on
viability.
and
this
is
an
interest.
if
this
elevation
were
permitted,
it
would
authorize
states
to
prohibit
all
abortions.
that's
an
impermissible
purpose
under
casey.
coupled
with
this
impermissible
effect
of
effectively
depriving
women
in
nebraska
of
the
safest
and
most
medically
appropriate
method
of
second
trimester
abortion,
the
statute
simply
can't
survive
under
this
court's
decisions.
indeed,
when
you...
when
you
consider
the
state
interests
there...
some
of
the
other
state
interests
that
are
proposed,
not
even
they
are
served
by
the
statute.
the
interest
in,
for
example,
cruelty
to
the
fetus.
there's
no
evidence
that
that
interest
is
served
here.
in
fact,
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
cruelty
to
the
fetus
at
all.
so,
we're
looking
at
a
statute
that
doesn't
serve
either
of
the
recognized
state
interests.
it
doesn't...
there's
no
evidence
that
it
serves
any
of
the
proposed
new
state
interests
by
permissible
means,
and
at
the
same
time,
it
imposes
some
health
risks
on
women.
that
sort
of
statute...
the
balancing
in
that
sort
of
statute
is
decisively
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
any
interpretation,
whether
broad
or
narrow.
for
example,
again,
if...
if
the
state...
if
the
state
couldn't
really
prohibit
a
more
dangerous
procedure
for
abortions
such
as
hysterotomy
because
those
methods
are
most
medically
appropriate
for
some
women.
and
to
take
one
method
like
the
d&x
technique
out
of
the
hands
of
physicians
performing
pre-viability
abortions
inevitably
makes
abortion
more
dangerous
for
women.
so,
when
this
court,
for
example,
in
danforth
struck
down
the...
missouri's
prohibition
on
saline
abortions,
it
took
a
step
that
enabled
physicians
to
continue
to
develop
newer,
safer
methods
of
abortion.
that
really
relates
to
one
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
stenberg
in
his
opening,
which
is
that,
well,
why
aren't
all
these
other
physicians
around
the
country
doing
this
if
it's
so
safe?
the
reason
is
that
it's
new.
any
new
surgical
technique,
any
new
medical
technique
is
at
the
beginning
going
to
be
used
only
in
a
scattered
way.
mr.
simon
heller
we
don't
know
and
that's
because
we
don't
know
whether
in
the
future
even
new
methods
will
replace
this
method
as
the
safest
for
women.
but
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
always
pushed
in
the
direction
of
allowing
physicians
to
exercise
judgment
so
that
they
could
determine
the
safest
possible
means
of
performing
abortion
not
state
legislators.
it
should
be
the
doctor
deciding
how
surgery
is
performed,
not
the
nebraska
senators.
so,
with
the
improper
purpose
and
with
the
lack
of
service
of
any
state
interest,
we
believe
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
but
i
want
to
turn
to
yet
an
additional
problem
with
the
statute
which
is...
which
is
its
lack
of
any
health
exception.
this
is
a
problem
which
even
the
attorney
general
doesn't
suggest,
well,
go
ahead,
we
think
it
should
be
interpreted
to
have
a
health
exception.
they
don't
want
it
to
have
a
health
exception.
they
resist
that
interpretation
which
could
ameliorate
one
of
the
constitutional
problems
with
the
statute.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
there...
there
has
certainly
been
criticism
of
that,
of
course.
but
considering,
for
example,
nebraska's
post-viability
abortion
prohibition,
which
has
exceptions
for
the
life
and
health
of
the
woman
without
restriction,
there's...
there's
no
evidence,
for
example,
that
that
statute
has
ever
been
misapplied
by
a
physician
in
nebraska.
nor
is
there
a
suggestion
that
similar
statutes
have
ever
been
misapplied
by
physicians
in
other
states.
so
that
this
sort
of
health
exception
which--
mr.
simon
heller
--well,
i
think
there's
criticism,
for
example,
from
some
who
oppose
abortion
entirely.
mr.
simon
heller
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
that...
that
claim.
a
physician
who
used
a
different
abortion
technique
for
a
woman
who
was
sick
or
dying
and
not
because
it
was
the
most
appropriate
technique
would
already
be
subject
to
malpractice
penalties
and
penalties
for
unprofessional
conduct.
so,
if
this
was
going
on,
we
would
see
evidence
of
it.
but
in
fact,
what
we
see
is
just
increasing
safety
of
abortion
for
women
in
the
united
states.
the
lack
of
a
health
exception
is
also
one
that
could
not
be,
in
our
view,
cured
by
any
sort
of
certification
process,
which
has
been
suggested,
because
it
would
really
require
just
rewriting
the
statute,
and...
and
we
believe
the
nebraska
supreme
court
would
not
do
that,
nor
would
the
nebraska
attorney
general
want
them
to.
mr.
simon
heller
well,
in...
in
thornburgh,
this
court
required
that
a
choice
of
methods
statute
not
impose
risks
on
the
woman's
health--
mr.
simon
heller
--well--
mr.
simon
heller
--i
don't
think
thornburgh
says
that.
i
think
thornburgh
says
that
the
state--
mr.
simon
heller
--i
think
the
rule
is
under
thornburgh
that
the
state
cannot
impose
significant
risks
on
women's
health
after
viability.
before
viability
where
the
state
interest
in
the
fetus
is
much
less
than
after--
mr.
simon
heller
--first,
again
the
district
court
findings
say
that
there
is
an
appreciable
health
risk
from
prohibiting
the
d&x
technique.
but
secondly,
again
part
of
this
calculus
is
looking
at
the
state
interests,
and
the
state...
there
are
no
state
interests
served
by
this
statute,
unlike
the
post-viability
statute
which
serves
a
very
compelling
interest.
mr.
simon
heller
we
believe
that
the
conclusion
here
must
be
drawn
from
much
of
the
evidence
that
could
not
be
disputed
in
any
case
around
the
country,
which
is
that
the
ama
and
the...
and
acog
both
recognize
that
this,
the
d&x
procedure--
mr.
simon
heller
--that's
absolutely
correct.
the
risks--
mr.
simon
heller
--absolutely.
and
so,
it
helps
the
10
to
20
women,
for
example,
for
whom
dr.
carhart
is
able
to
perform
the
d&x
technique.
