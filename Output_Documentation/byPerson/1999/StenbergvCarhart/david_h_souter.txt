justice
david
h.
souter
--i
take
it
that
save
with
respect
to
a...
an
exception
to
save
the
woman's
life,
and
so
on,
that
post
viability
abortions
are
generally
precluded,
by
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
post
viability
abortions
are
generally
prohibited,
i
assume,
by
separate
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
your
position
that
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
incapable
of
covering
d&e
perhaps
because
of
the
intent
requirement,
or
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
a
gray
area,
and
the
better
interpretation
is
the
one
in
accordance
with
the
legislative
intent,
which
was
simply
to
get
to
the
d&x
abortion?
which
is
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
mean,
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
the
exception
to
save
life.
there
are
very
rarely
instances,
probably,
in
the
whole
spectrum
of
abortion
practice
in
which
the
life
exception
is
necessary,
but
you
can't
thereby
simply
say,
well,
we're
going
to
allow
the
legislature
to
ignore
those
cases
and
eliminate
a
life
exception
even
in
your
later
term
prohibition,
so
why,
i
guess,
should
the
legislature
be
more
cavalier
in
overruling
medical
judgment
in
this
circumstance?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
most
appropriate
procedure,
as
justice
stevens
is
quoting
their
brief
as
doing,
i
think
normally
we
take...
at
least
i
take
that
to
mean
the
procedure
which
is
most
conducive
to
an
uncomplicated
abortion
and
hence
one
that
does
not
present
any
health
risks
that
can
be
avoided,
so
i
find
your
assumption
hard
to
accept
if
we
are
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
the
position
stated
in
the
ob-gyn
brief.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
think
the
waiting
period,
the
object
behind
the
waiting
period
is
its
tendency
to
induce
second
thoughts
about
having
the
abortion?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
think
that
does
go
to
the
potential
life
involved
in
the
viability
of
the
fetus,
when
the
fetus,
at
the
stage
it
would
become
viable
and
hence
subject
to
full
protection.
