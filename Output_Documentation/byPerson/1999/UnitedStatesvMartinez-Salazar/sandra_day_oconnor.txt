do
you
have
a
fall-back
position?
because
that
one
is
not
very
attractive.
justice

o'connor
so,
what's
your
second
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
that
we
don't
accept
the
government's
proposal,
your
first
choice
here.
then
what's
your
fall-back
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
rule
that
you
propose
would
turn
every
for-cause
ruling
of
the
judge
into
an
automatic
reversal
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
that
would
be
troublesome.
