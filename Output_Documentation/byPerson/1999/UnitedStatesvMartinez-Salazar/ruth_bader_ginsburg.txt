justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
rules
are
concerned,
mr.
dreeben,
this
case
is...
is
perhaps
larger
than...
on
the
face
because
the
same
peremptory
challenge
by
rule,
by
federal
rule,
exists
on
the
civil
side.
so,
is
your
argument
today
based
on
the
consequences
of
not
allowing
a
challenge
for
cause
improperly...
does
that...
would
that
follow
equally
for
civil
peremptory
for-cause
challenges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
dreeben,
it
would
leave
out
the
case
where
the
lawyer
says,
i
know
i
don't
have
a
basis
for
a
challenge
for
cause.
i
can't
say
this
would
be
a
biased
juror.
but
he
just
seems
fishy
to
me.
i
don't
think
he'd
be
good
for
my
client.
that's
what
a
peremptory
is
supposed
to
do.
and
that
you...
you
say
would
be
immunized
from
appeal.
just
too
bad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case,
even
the...
i
think
you...
you
gave
us
at
the
outset
three
stopping
points.
in
this
case
you
could
say,
well,
even
if
that
were
the
rule,
this
doesn't
make
it
because...
because
this
defendant
didn't
point
to
any
juror
sitting
on
that
jury
that
the
defendant
would
have
exercised
a
peremptory
against.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
dreeben,
there's
not
a
word
in
the
advisory
committee
note
that
suggests
that
the
federal
peremptory
challenge
was
to
be
used
when
the
judge
makes
an
error
for
cause.
that
was
the
oklahoma
law.
but
if
you
read
the
federal
rules,
on
the
civil
side
and
on
the
criminal
side,
they
say,
you
have
x
number
of
peremptory
challenges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
i
asked
you
about
the
civil
case
because
the
third
circuit
in
this
kirk
against
raymark
industries
case
took
the
same
position
on
the
civil
side
that
the
ninth
circuit
took
on
the
criminal
side;
that
is,
if
you
are
denied
a
challenge
for
cause
improperly,
you
get
a
new
trial.
the
third
circuit...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
gordon,
in
this
case
there
wasn't
even
the
suggestion
by
counsel
that
if
i
had
that
extra
peremptory,
juror
10
would
not
have
been
on
that
panel.
so,
we're
talking
in
kind
of
abstract
terms
when
in
this
case,
there
was
neither
a
biased
juror
sitting
on
the
panel,
nor
even
one
that
the
defense
counsel
said
i
would
have
challenged
this
one
if
i
could
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
record,
he
could
have
said,
your
honor,
i've
been
obliged
to
use
my
peremptory,
but
i
want
it
on
the
record
that
i
would
have
used
it
against
one
of
these
jurors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
that
absconding
juror
was,
in
fact,
replaced
by
the
alternate
against
whom
no
peremptory
had
been
exercised.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
could
have
been
a
peremptory
challenge
exercised
against
the
alternate
and
there
wasn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
rule
24
doesn't
say
anything
about
automatic
reversal.
it's
part
of
a
set
of
rules
that
has,
on
the
one
hand,
you
get
10
peremptory
challenges,
and
on
the
other
hand,
you
disregard
errors
that
are
not
substantial.
and
if
there
is
an
impartial
jury
in
fact,
then
how
can
one
say
that
a
substantial
right...
the
substantial
right
being
the
impartial
jury...
has
been
affected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
a
right
that
sounds
like
it
has
constitutional
dimensions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
that's
what
you
say,
and
it's
a
question,
what
is
the
substantial
right
for
purposes
of
rule
52?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
just
saying
that
anytime
you
don't
get
what
the
rules
say
you
should
get,
it
affects
a
substantial
right,
and
that
can't
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
where
do
you...
i
suppose
as
you
say
due
process,
you
are
saying
that
peremptories...
not
merely
peremptories,
but
10
peremptories
are
required
by
due
process.
that
seems
to
be
what
you're
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you
say
whatever
number
the
legislature
picks,
if
that
number
is
not
observed,
there's
one
short,
it's
a
due
process
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
clear
on
what
you
mean
by
arbitrarily
denied.
and
you're
not
suggesting
that
this
trial
court
wasn't
acting
in
total
good
faith
trying
to
achieve
an
unbiased
jury.
he
may
have
made
a
mistake,
but
to
call
it
arbitrary
i
think
is
questionable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
challenges
to
potential
jurors
in
federal
criminal
trials.
in
selecting
jury,
parties
are
entitled
to
an
unlimited
number
of
challenges
forcause.
cause
can
be,
for
example,
the
potential
juror's
relationship
to
a
party
or
a
pre-judgment
of
an
issue
in
the
case.
parties
are
also
allotted
a
limited
number
of
so-called
peremptory
challenges.
peremptory
challenges
allow
a
party
to
remove
from
the
jury
individuals
the
party
does
not
wish
to
serve
on
it,
even
if
there
are
insufficient
grounds
to
challenge
forcause.
in
this
case,
defense
counsel
sought
to
remove
a
juror
forcause;
the
trial
judge
denied
the
forcause
strike
and
it
is
now
conceded
that
the
trial
judge's
ruling
was
wrong.
to
keep
the
unwanted
individual
off
the
jury,
defense
counsel
exercised
the
peremptory
challenge.
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
on
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
he
successfully
argued
that
the
erroneous
ruling
on
his
forcause
objection
automatically
entitled
him
to
a
new
trial.
in
today's
decision,
we
reversed
the
ninth
circuit
to
do
one
judgment.
respondent
martinez-salazar
and
a
co-defendant
faced
trial
in
federal
court
in
arizona
for
narcotics
and
weapons
offences.
the
trial
judge
following
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
24,
gave
the
two
defendants
ten
peremptory
challenges
to
exercise
jointly
in
the
selection
of
12
jurors
and
one
more
for
the
selection
of
an
alternate.
potential
juror
don
gilbert
said
in
response
to
questions
put
by
the
judge,
"all
things
being
equal,
he
would
probably
tend
to
favor
the
prosecution".
when
the
judge
refused
to
dismiss
gilbert
forcause,
martinez-salazar
used
the
peremptory
challenge
to
remove
gilbert
and
thereafter
used
all
his
remaining
peremptory
challenges.
at
the
close
of
jury
selection,
martinez-salazar's
counsel
said
he
had
no
objection
to
any
juror
actually
seated.
on
appeal
from
his
convictions,
martinez-salazar
argued
that
the
trial
court's
error
in
refusing
to
dismiss
gilbert
forcause
automatically
required
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
a
new
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
therefore
reversed
the
convictions.
we
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
disagreement
on
this
issue
among
the
circuits.
the
government
initially
argued
that
federal
law
requires
a
defendant
to
use
a
peremptory
challenge
to
strike
a
juror
who
should
have
been
removed
forcause
in
order
to
preserve
for
appeal
the
issue
of
the
trial
court's
error.
while
we
do
not
adopt
that
position,
we
agree
with
the
government's
fallback
argument
that
the
rule
governing
jury
selection,
rule
24
and
due
process
were
not
violated
in
this
case.
martinez-salazar
had
a
choice,
albeit
a
hard
one,
when
the
trial
court
refused
to
dismiss
gilbert
forcause.
he
could
exercise
the
peremptory
to
strike
gilbert
or
he
could
stand
on
his
forcause
objection
and
then,
if
convicted,
challenge
the
seating
of
gilbert
on
appeal.
choosing
to
remove
gilbert
rather
than
taking
his
chances
on
appeal,
martinez-salazar
did
not
lose
a
peremptory
challenge
rather
he
used
a
peremptory
in
a
manner
consistent
with
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
the
challenge
to
help
secure
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
our
decision
takes
account
of
the
reality
of
the
jury
selection
process,
challenges
forcause
and
rulings
on
them
are
fast-paced,
made
on
the
spot
and
under
pressure.
