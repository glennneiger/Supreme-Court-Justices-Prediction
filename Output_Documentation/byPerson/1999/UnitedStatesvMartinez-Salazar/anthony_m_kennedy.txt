do
you
adequately
preserve
it
if
you
object
and
say,
i
want
an
extra
peremptory?
suppose...
suppose
the
biased
juror
is
seated
wrongfully.
all
the
peremptories
have
been
exercised
and
you
ask
for
an
additional
peremptory.
is...
is
that
preserving
your
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
you
have
no
peremptories
left
and
the
judge
doesn't
give
you
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
that
he
didn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
under
your
rule
it
works
the
other
way
around
because
if...
if...
i
suppose
the
trial
judge
could
say,
you
know,
there's
a
lot
of
close
for-cause
issues
here.
i'm
not
sure.
you
guys...
you
people
exercise
your
peremptories
first
and
then
i'll
rule
on
the
for-cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
he
get
an
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do...
do
you
have
any
way
to
tell
us
how
often
difficult
for-cause
questions
come
before
trial
courts?
i...
i
just
have
no
feeling
for
how
often
the
judge
really
has
to
make
a
close
call
on
for-cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
for...
on
for-cause
challenges.
