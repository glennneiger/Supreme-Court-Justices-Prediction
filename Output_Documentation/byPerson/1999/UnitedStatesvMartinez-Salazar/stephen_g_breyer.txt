are...
are
there
any
courts
that
have,
if
it's
just
a
cause...
excuse
this
juror
for
cause.
the
judge
says
no.
the
judge
is
wrong
on
appeal.
are
there
any
courts
that
don't
give
a
new
trial
in
that
circumstance?
i'm
leaving
peremptories
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
but
leaving
peremptories
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
they
all
go
on
that
theory.
it's
the
oklahoma
type
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
ones
that
don't,
they
either
give
him
a
new
trial
or
they
go
on
that
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
the
judge
supposed
to
know
that
he's
making
a
mistake?
i
mean,
judges
aren't
mind-readers.
you
argue
here
that
the
judge
has
made
a
mistake
of
law
and
you
never
told
him.
or
it
wasn't
you,
but
i
mean,
the
lawyer
didn't
tell
him,
judge,
you're
making
a
mistake.
that's
the
point
of
having
to
object.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
part
do
you
disagree
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
part
that
judges
aren't
mind-readers
or
the
part...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
the
error
was
denying
a
for-cause
challenge.
certainly
you
could
appeal
that
error.
of
course.
unfortunately,
it
didn't
hurt
you
because
he
didn't
sit.
all
right.
what's
the
next
error?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
mean,
is
there
any
other
error
he
made?
i
agree
he
made
the
error
of
denying
the
for-cause
challenge.
now,
was
there
another
error
he
made?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
up
here
on
another
error.
