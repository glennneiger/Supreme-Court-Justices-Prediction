mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
recurring
problem
in
federal
jury
selection:
the
erroneous
refusal
of
a
trial
judge
to
dismiss
a
potential
juror
for
cause,
followed
by
the
defendant's
exercise
of
a
peremptory
challenge
to
remove
that
juror
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
that
sequence
of
events
requires
automatic
reversal
of
a
conviction
whenever
the
defendant
goes
on
to
exhaust
his
peremptory
challenges
during
jury
selection.
we
disagree
with
that
result
for
three
alternative
theories.
first,
the
use
of
a
peremptory
challenge
to
exclude
a
juror
who
should
have
been
excused
for
cause
is
not
a
denial
or
impairment
of
the
peremptory
challenge
right,
but
is
a
proper
purpose
for
which
the
challenge
is
used.
second,
assuming
that
there
is
an
impairment
of
the
peremptory
challenge
right
in
a
case
like
this
one,
that
impairment
does
not
warrant
reversal
of
an
otherwise
fair
trial
where
the
jury
that
is
actually
empaneled
and
sits
is
impartial
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
and
third,
even
if
there
is
a
case
in
which,
despite
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
that
sits,
there
might
be
an
error
in
the
peremptory
challenge
process
that
affects
substantial
rights,
no
such
effect
should
be
found
in
a
case
like
this
one
where
the
defendant
had
concededly
untrammeled
use
of
9
out
of
10
of
his
peremptory
challenges
and
never
indicated
on
the
record
that
he
objected
to
any
panel
member
that
was
actually
empaneled
and
seated
on
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
source
of
peremptory
challenge
rights
in
the
federal
system
is
rule
24
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
provides
a
right
of
peremptory
challenge
to
the
defense
in
criminal
cases
that
increases
in
number
depending
on
the
type
of
case
that
there
is.
now,
rule
24
does
not,
by
its
terms,
spell
out
what
procedures
trial
courts
should
use
to
administer
the
peremptory
challenge
process.
and
this
court
has
long
made
it
clear
that
trial
courts
have
discretion
to
formulate
appropriate
procedures.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
the...
the
only
impairment
that
is
conceivable
on
this
record
in
our
view
would
be
of
the
rule
24
right
of
peremptory
challenge.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
effect,
converted
what
it
thought
was
a
violation
of
the
rule
into
a
due
process
problem
by
reasoning
that
any
time
a
defendant
is
deprived
of
a
rule-based
right,
the
defendant
is
also
deprived
of
a
procedural
right
protected
by
the
constitution.
that
is
not
a
theory
that
this
court
has
ever
endorsed
in
its
analysis
of
a
variety
of
rule-based
and
statutory
rights,
particularly
in
the
context
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
as
a...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
rule
that...
that
we
are
arguing
for
today
would
apply
equally,
if
not
even
more
strongly,
in
the
civil
context.
this
court
has
already
made
clear
in
the
mcdonough
v.
greenwood
case
that
errors
in
the
voir
dire
process
that
might
impair
the
intelligent
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
harmful
error
requiring
reversal
of
a...
of
a
civil
judgment.
and
the
principle
that
the
court
applied
in
that
case
is
that
the
cost
to
society,
to
the
courts,
to
the
litigants
is
too
high
to
reverse
a
conviction
simply
because
an
error
in
the
jury
selection
process
might
have
infringed
a
party's
desire
to
remove
a
particular
juror
on
a
peremptory
basis
rather
than
for
cause.
now,
if
the
error
in
question
in
jury
selection
actually
results
in
the
seating
of
a
biased
juror
and
the
defendant
has
adequately
preserved
that
challenge,
that
is
an
entirely
different
case
because
that
case
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
the
sixth
amendment
protects
for
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
our
view
it
would...
it
would
not
result
in
an
error
that
would
require
reversal
of
the
conviction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless
the...
the
juror
who
you
would
have
exercised
the
peremptory
against
is
in
fact
a
biased
juror
so
that
he
sits
on
the
jury...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
he
does
not...
if
he
does
not
sit
on
the
jury,
our
position
is
that
the
claim
may
be
preserved,
but
the
claim
doesn't
warrant
relief
because
the
costs
to
society
are
simply
too
high
to
reverse
a
conviction
simply
because
a
defendant
has
been
deprived
of,
in
that...
in
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
has
given,
one
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
will
be
prejudice,
justice
souter,
if
in
fact
the
defendant
is
forced
by
virtue
of
the
exhaustion
of
peremptory
challenges
to
accept
a
juror
on
his
panel
who
is
biased.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
court
accepts
our
primary
harmless
error
theory
that
the
only
cognizable
harm
that
the
defendant
can
assert
is
the
deprivation
of
an
impartial
jury,
that's
correct.
now,
we
have
a
fall-back...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
souter,
it
doesn't
say
to
the
litigants
or
to
federal
trial
judges,
forget
peremptories.
there
is
a
rule-based
right
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
a
variety
of
different
scenarios
that
could
come
up.
in
the
federal
system,
if
a
judge
announced
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
which
i'm
not
aware
that
any
judge
has
done,
but
if
the
judge
announced
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
in
my
courtroom
we
simply
don't
have
peremptory
challenges,
i
think
they're
a
waste
of
time
and
inefficient,
i
would
assume
that
a
defendant
would
be
able
to
pursue
a
extraordinary
writ
in
a
court
of
appeals
and
have
that
error
corrected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
and
i
would
expect
that
the
appellate
court
would
write
a
rather
strong
opinion
that
would
admonish
that
trial
judge
and
others
in
the
circuit
not
to
flout
the
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
a
defendant
would
have
a
different
objection
in
that
case,
which
would
be
that
there
the...
the
judge
had
essentially
changed
the
way
the
peremptory
challenges
were...
were
administered
under
settled
rules
of
the
common
law,
and
therefore
he
could
tell
the
judge
that
that
is
not
the
way
that
peremptory
challenges
are
administered.
now,
the
question...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this...
this
court...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
would
be
our
position,
justice
scalia,
but
it's
important
to
distinguish...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
o'connor,
that...
that
fact
scenario
was
not
actually
the
fact
scenario
of
this
case,
and
i
would...
would
agree
that
it
is
a
far
more
serious
intrusion
upon
the
defendant's
rights
and
upon
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system
if
a
biased
juror
actually
sits
on
the
panel.
there
are
states
that
have
determined
that
in
the
administration
of
the
peremptory
challenge
process,
there
should
be
no
gamesmanship
about
whether
a
biased
juror
sits
or
doesn't
sit.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
our
fall-back
harmless
error
position
is
that
the
question
in
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
is
claiming
that
his
peremptory
challenge
rights
have
been
infringed
is
whether
there
is
a
significant
enough
effect
on
those
rights
to
justify
setting
aside
the
conviction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far
and
i
don't
want
to
fall
back
any
farther
than
i
have
to.
but
let
me
point...
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
principle
could
be
applied
consistently
to
cover
both
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
essentially,
justice
ginsburg,
where
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
government
disagree
on
this
case
is
how
serious
an
injury
that
is
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
the
ninth
circuit's
position
is
that
regardless
of
how
fair
the
actual
unfolding
of
the
trial
process
is,
whether
the
defendant
had
counsel
who
performed
effectively,
introduced
the
evidence
that
he
wanted
to
introduce,
got
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
government's
witnesses,
and
had
a
impartial
jury
within
the
sixth
amendment...
the
ninth
circuit's
position
is,
despite
all
of
that,
the
impairment
of
a
rule-based,
non-constitutional
peremptory
challenge,
even
a
single
one,
requires
tossing
out
the
entire
results
of
the
trial
and
starting
over.
our
position
is
simply
that
that
is
far
too
high
a
price
to
pay
in
a
case
in
which
the
error
does
not
affect
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
trial,
as
an
infringement
of
peremptory
challenges
does
not.
this
court
has
reserved
the
category
of
structural
error,
error
that
justifies
setting
aside
the
results
of
a
trial
even
though
one
cannot
determine
any
effect
on
the
outcome,
for
very
serious
and
deep
constitutional
injuries
to
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
trial,
such
as
the
total
denial
of
counsel,
or
the
sitting
of
a
biased
judge,
or
the
denial
of
a
proper
reasonable
doubt
instruction,
the
kind
of
error
that
fundamentally
infects
the
trial
with
unfairness
or
unreliability.
our
position
is
that
the
denial
or
infringement
of
a
single
peremptory
challenge
simply
does
not
rise
to
that
level.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
would
be
falling
back
all
the
way
further
than
some
members
of
the
court
have
suggested
that
the
government
needs
to
go.
that
is
a
case-specific
result
in
this
case
because
this
defendant,
when
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
jury
selection
process,
and
the
judge
said,
well,
i
have
a
bunch
of
jurors
in
the
box
and
i'm
about
to
swear
them,
any
objection,
the
defendant
said,
no.
in
this
case
there
was
no
request
for
an
additional
peremptory
challenge
to
use
it
against
any
other
juror,
and
even
if
there
might
be
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
consider
reversing
a
conviction
merely
because
of
the
impairment
of
peremptory
challenges,
i
don't
think
this
is
that
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
that
is
a
substantial
risk,
justice
souter.
i
also
think
that
it's
true
that
trial
lawyers,
when
they're
selecting
a
jury,
are
trying
to
obtain
either
a
result
that
wholly
favors
their
client...
the
defendant
will
be
seeking
an
acquittal...
or
at
the
very
least
a
hung
jury.
and
so,
a...
a
defense
lawyer
may
not
be
willing
to
take
the
risk
that
he'll
have
some
sort
of
reversible
error
on
appeal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that...
that
is
in
fact
the
way
peremptories
are
used,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the...
the
legitimate
purposes
that
have
been
ascribed
by
historical
sources,
going
back
to
blackstone,
for
the
peremptory
challenge
include
a
buffer
zone
for
the
impartiality
of
the
juror.
judges
may
make
mistakes.
peremptory
challenges
help
clean
up
those
mistakes
and
safeguard
the
fundamental
sixth
amendment
value
which
is
at
stake
here.
the
peremptory
challenge
also
serves
some
more
symbolic
or
atmospheric
purposes
of
making
the
defendant
more
comfortable
with
the
jury
that
actually
is
going
to
decide
his
fate,
and
giving
some
assurance
to
the
community
that
because
the
litigants
have
participated
in
jury
selection,
the
body
that
actually
decides
the
case
is
fairly
disposed
to
decide
it
based
on
the
facts
and
the
evidence
and
the
law.
the
question
here
is
since
the
jury
that
actually
sat
is
indisputably
impartial,
are
those
additional
values
of
the
peremptory
challenge,
its
reassurance
to
the
litigants
of
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
and
its
reassurance
to
the
community
that
the
verdict
should
be
respected...
are
those
values
sufficient
to
justify
throwing
out
the
results
of
an
otherwise
fair
trial?
and
our
judgment
is
that
they
are
not.
they
are
important
values,
but
they
are
not
constitutionally
protected
values.
they
are
neither
values
that
go
to
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
judgment,
nor
do
they
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
ultimate
conviction
that
ensued
in
this
case.
and
as
a
result...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
that
in
our
view
the
most
that
could
be
said
is
that
there
was
an
infringement
of
a
rule-based
right.
the
first
position
that
we
have
for
the
court's
consideration
is
that
federal
law
ought
to
be
construed
the
same
way
that
oklahoma
law
was
construed
in
ross
v.
oklahoma,
which
is
to
say
that
the
peremptory
challenge
should
properly
be
regarded
as
serving
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
impartiality
of
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
oklahoma
law
was
the
same,
justice
ginsburg.
there
was
nothing
in
the
statutes
or
the
rules
that
governed
the
court
that
determined
whether
there
would
be
a
procedural
error
if
the
defendant
had
to
use
a
peremptory
challenge
to
cure
a
for-cause
strike,
or
to
put
it
another
way,
whether
once
a
defendant
does
cure
the
error
in
the
for-cause
denial,
he
has
been
deprived
of
anything
protected
under
the
rules.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
have
both
halves
of
that
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
have
that
interpretation,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
essential
that
the
court
agree
with
that
in
order
to
agree
that
there
is
no
infringement
of
the
peremptory
challenge
when
the
defendant
actually
does
what
he
does
in
this
case
because
assuming
that
he
could
get
review
if
he
lets
the
biased
juror
sit
on
the
jury
and
he
actually
has
a
fact-finder
who
doesn't
satisfy
the
sixth
amendment
and
this
court
determines
that's
an
error
that
warrants
review
either
under
reserved...
preserved
error
or
plain
error,
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
should
also
have
the
opportunity
of
having
it
the
other
way,
actually
using
his
peremptory
challenge
to
remove
that
biased
juror
and
still
getting
reversal
on
the
theory
that
his
peremptory
challenge
rights
have
been
infringed.
and
that's
where
we
fundamentally
part
company
with
respondent.
respondent
would
have
it
that
the
defendant
automatically
gets
reversal
of
his
conviction
if
the
judge
makes
even
a
single
error
in
assessing
a
for-cause
challenge.
and
that
is
not
an
uncommon
experience
in
the
federal
system.
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
doesn't
result
in
the
reversal
of
convictions
in
many
circuits
is
they
employ
the
rule
that
we're
advocating
here.
if
the
defendant
uses
his
peremptory
challenge
and
the
juror
doesn't
actually
sit,
then
the
defendant
has
not
suffered
the
sort
of
harm
that
warrants
reversing
his
conviction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
even...
and
that's
right,
and
even
if
the
juror
is
removed
with
a
peremptory
challenge,
that's
the
position
that
the
third
circuit
would
take.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
that's
what
we
disagree
with
in
this
case.
most
of
the
courts
that
have
adopted
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
for
these
sorts
of
errors
in
the
peremptory
challenge
process
have
relied
on
swain
v.
alabama
and
on
dictum
that
appears
in
that
decision
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
denial
of
the
peremptory
challenge
is
so
important
that
it
warrants
a
reversal
without
any
further
showing
of
error.
now
swain,
of
course,
didn't
involve
any
question
of
an
infringement
of
the
defense
peremptory
challenges.
that
statement
had
no
relationship
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
but
swain
was
citing
and
relying
on
cases
from
the
19th
century
that
had
reversed
convictions
without
any
inquiry
into
whether
there
was
harmful
error.
those
decisions
all
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
and
the
federal
harmless
error
rule.
and
it's
our
submission
that
that
dictum,
which
was
not
authoritative
in
the
case
in
which
it
was
announced
in
any
event,
should
not
be
followed
by
this
court
today
because
the
approach
taken
in
federal
law
is
that
if
an
error
does
not
have
the
sorts
of
harms
that
warrant
reversal,
it
shall
be
disregarded.
now,
there
are
two
ways
to
look
at
the
problem
of
harmless
error.
one
is
to
say,
is
there
a...
is
there
a
perceptible
effect
on
the...
on
the
outcome
of
the
case?
when
all
that
you
have
is
the
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge,
there
is
no
way
to
say
that
there
is
a
perceptible
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case.
that
kind
of
analysis
applies
when
there
is
evidence
that
shouldn't
have
been
admitted
but
was
admitted
or
evidence
that
was
excluded
that
should
have
been
let
in
to
the
case,
and
it's
possible
to
make
an
analysis
of
the
entire
record
and
determine
whether
there
was
injurious
error.
the
other
category
of
harmless
error
analysis
is
what
the
court
has
sometimes
referred
to
as
structural
error
which
is
the
sort
of
fundamental
deprivation
of
the
basic
elements
of
the
trial
process.
and
in
that
context,
the
court
does
not
look
to
see
whether
there
is
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case.
reversal
is
automatic.
the
ninth
circuit
has
sorted
out
this
error
into
the
structural
error
box.
the
government's
position
is
that
was
wrong,
that
there
is
no
way
to
categorize
this
error
on
the
level
of
the
errors
that
merit
treatment
as
structural
error.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
judges
make
close
calls
in
virtually
every
case
in
which
juries
are
empaneled
because
many
jurors...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
on
for-cause
challenges
not
so
much
on
whether
the
juror
is
actually
qualified,
whether
he's
a
citizen
and
whether
he's
over
18
and
whether
he
speaks
english,
but
on
the
question
of
whether
the
juror
can
really
be
impartial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
and
there
is
the
principle
of
abuse
of
discretion
and
it's
hard
to
overcome
that.
so,
most
challenges
to
for-cause
that
the
judge
rejects
do
not
result
in
appellate
reversal.
but
it's
important
to
remember
that
jury
selection
doesn't
take
place
with
the
parties
having
transcripts
in
front
of
them
of
what
jurors
actually
said.
they
have
to
rely
on
the
recollections
of
the
judge
and
the
parties.
you're
dealing
with
a
lot
of
different
jurors.
in
this
case,
if
you
read
the
jury
selection
process,
many,
many
jurors
were
brought
in
for
individual
questioning
because
of
things
that
they
said
on
the
questionnaire.
some
of
those
jurors,
when
questioned
more
closely
about
whether
they
would
favor
one
side
or
the
other,
ultimately
concluded
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
be
able
to
follow
your
instructions
and
apply
the
law
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
when
the...
when
the
juror
actually
sits
on
a
case?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
there
are...
there
are
courts
that
will
treat
it
as
a
waiver
of
the
defendant's
right
to
challenge
the
juror...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
hard
to
leave
peremptories
out
of
it,
justice
breyer,
because...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what...
what
normally...
what...
no,
they
don't
all
go
on
that
theory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
and
those
cases
treat
the
failure
to
exercise
a
peremptory
as
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
complain
about
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
or
the
lack
of
impartiality
of
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
judge
probably
does
have
inherent
authority
to
do
it,
and
if
he
did
it...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
does
not
have
it
under
the
terms
of
the
rule,
and
one
could
read
the
rules
quite
strictly
to
say
only
in
multi-defendant
cases
can
a
judge
do
it.
in
fact,
the
process
of
jury
selection
is
basically
aimed
towards
achieving
an
impartial
fact-finder
that
can
decide
the
case,
and
the
judge
has
to
have
latitude
to
ensure
that
he
basically
gets
it
right
because
we
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
assuring
the
finality
of
the
verdict.
it's
hard
to
get
everybody
to
come
to
court
for
the
trial.
it
costs
a
lot
of
money.
it
takes
a
lot
of
time
for
everybody.
once
that
is
done,
the
judge
has
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
latitude
to
make
sure
that
this
particular
jury
will
not
be
subject
to
it
being
assailed
on
appeal.
in
this
very
case,
for
example,
there
was
a
question
that
arose
about
whether
one
of
the
selected
jurors
could
sit
on
the
jury
because
he
had
absconded
after
jury
selection
and
he
didn't
quite
come
back
for
some
further
instructions
by
the
court,
and
then
he
was
later
found
and
brought
back
to
court.
the
judge
said,
i
don't
really
want
any
problems
with
this.
the
defendant
has
objected.
the
government's
position
is
sort
of
up
in
the
middle.
i'm
just
going
to
not
put
the
guy
on
the
jury
so
that
i
have
the
assurance
that
there
will
be
no
reversible
error
claims
that
will
remain
at
the
end
of
jury
selection.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
many
things
that
a
trial
judge
can
do
in
orchestrating
jury
selection
that
have
effects
on
the
defendant's
peremptory
challenges
that
are
equally
severe,
if
not
more
severe
than
this
one.
the
trial
judge,
can
in
a
multi-defendant
case
require
all
the
defendants
to
exercise
their
peremptory
challenges
together
without
extending
any
additional
challenges
so
that
each
defendant
is
reduced
down
from
the
number,
in
effect,
of
10
provided
in
the
rule
to
5
because
he's
sharing
with
another
defendant.
the
trial
judge
can
require
the
parties
to
select
the
jury
by
exercising
their
challenges
simultaneously,
which
is
in
fact
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
in
that
event,
the
defendant
may
exercise
his
challenges
against
somebody
who
would
have
been
removed
by
the
government
in
any
event.
and
the
trial
judge
can
say
to
the
parties,
you
must
make
a
challenge
for
cause
and
then
instantaneously,
if
it's
denied,
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge,
and
if
you
do...
don't
do
that,
you
may
not
challenge
that
juror.
each
of
these
entirely
legitimate
procedures
may
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view,
infringe
what
would
otherwise
be
his
free
and
untrammeled
right
to
exercise
peremptory
challenges.
the
rule
that
we
ask
for
here,
which
is
that
if
the
defendant
does
actually
exercise
his
peremptory
challenge
to
remove
a
juror
who
should
have
been
removed
for
cause,
he
cannot
claim
error
on
appeal.
he
has
been
given
the
substance
of
the
right
and
there
is
no
basis
for
reversing
the
conviction.
thank
you.
