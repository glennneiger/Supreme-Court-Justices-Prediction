mr.
michael
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
justice
souter's
question
regarding
the...
whether
there
would
be
any
prejudice
ever
found
under
the
government's
proposed
rule
is
very
telling.
what
we're
discussing
here
are
two
alternative
propositions
for
addressing
harmless
error
in
the
case.
if
the
government
is
correct
in
its
primary
position
in
this
case,
the
error
will
almost
always
be
harmless.
mr.
michael
gordon
that...
that's
correct.
only
where
the...
where
the
trial
court
has
made
10
or
more
errors
in
the
federal
system
would
that
ever
occur,
otherwise
under
the
government's
primary
theory,
the
defendant
would
have
waived
the
right
to
assert
a
sixth
amendment
violation
later
on
down
the
road.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
government's
position
offers
the
defendant
nothing
and
relegates
the
peremptory
challenge
into
nothing
less
than
a
tool
to
clean
up
trial
court
errors
on
for-cause
challenges.
and
i
think
what
it
does
is
it
completely
ignores
the
primary
and
the
core
value
of
a
peremptory
challenge.
analytically
peremptory
challenges
are
very
distinct
from
for-cause
challenges.
they
are
intended
to
be
exercised
on
an
otherwise
qualified
jury
pool.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i...
i
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
disagree
with
that
characterization
for
two
reasons.
first,
we
need
to
look
at
the
system
as
it
now
exists
today,
and
most
of
the
circuits
have
taken
the
position
consistent
with
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
primary
question
as
to
whether
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
with
respect
to
a
for-cause
challenge
is
already
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
it
allows
the
district
court
quite
a
lot
of
discretion
before
ever
reversing
that
conviction.
we
understand
that
even
in
the
government's
reply
brief
they
concede
that
that
decision
is
virtually
unassailable.
it's
only
in
the
rare
case,
perhaps
in
2,
maybe
1
percent
of
the
cases,
do
we
ever
reach
the
position
where
the
district
court
has
abused
its
discretion
and
failed
to
remove
the
juror
for
cause.
i
would
suggest
to
you
it's
the
existence
of
peremptory
challenges
that
allow
the...
that
allow
the
courts
of
appeals
to
have
some
comfort
in...
in
applying
that
very
discretionary
standard
of
review.
the
second
issue
is...
mr.
michael
gordon
no.
i
disagree
with
that
proposition.
defendant
has
the
right
to
use
the
challenge,
the
peremptory
challenge,
in
any
event
in
any
way
he
sees
fit.
when
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
with
respect
to
the
for-cause
challenge,
he
is
viewing
the
prospective
juror,
juror
gilbert
in
this
case
who
said
that
he
would
favor
the
prosecution,
and
he
is
looking
at
other
jurors
for
another
kind
of
bias,
that
kind
of
bias
that
cannot
be
articulated.
it
cannot
be
expressed
in
any
meaningful
way.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think
that's...
that's
partially
true.
i
don't
think
it's
illogical
in
a
sense,
but
i
think
that
question
ought
to
be
addressed
not
by
the
judiciary
but
by
the
legislative
branch.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
ignores
the
reality
of
the
trial.
as
the
government
has
explained,
the
defense
attorney
is
in
there
to
defend
the
case
and
to
win
the
case.
he
wanted
to
have
both
an
objectively
fair
and
impartial
jury
as
required
by
the
sixth
amendment,
and
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
remove
those
jurors
whom
he
perceived
prejudiced
in
this
case.
after
all,
we
have
to
understand
why
we
have
peremptory
challenges.
we
have
peremptory
challenges
because
we
entrust
counsel
to
intuit
with
respect
to
prospective
jurors
in
this
case.
defense
counsel...
mr.
michael
gordon
with
all
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
disagree
with
that
proposition
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is,
when
we
take
a
look
at
the
record
itself,
the
defendant...
when
the
for-cause
challenge
was
denied,
it
was
denied
twice.
the
defendant
asked
for
the
for-cause
challenge
to
be
granted.
it
was
denied.
the
defense
remind...
reminded
the
district
court
that...
that
the
juror
had
indicated
a
disregard
for
the
presumption
of
innocence.
prior
to
each
ruling,
the
district
court
indicated
that
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
use
a
peremptory
challenge,
he
could
use
that
peremptory
challenge.
it
ignores
the
realities
of
trial
to
have
the
defendant
stand
up
or
sit
up,
or
wherever
he
was
at,
and
ask
the...
ask
the
district
court
for
something
that
had
been
expressly
denied.
in
that
case...
and
secondly...
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
he...
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
he
could
have
done
that
was
not
at
the
time
the
peremptory
challenge...
or
the
for-cause
challenge
was
denied.
it
would
have
been
after
the
exercising
of
peremptory
challenges.
we
know
that
when
the
first
meaningful
opportunity
arose
to
ask
for
additional
peremptory
challenges,
when
juror...
prospective
juror...
actually
it
became
petit
juror
finck
ended
up
missing,
he
asked
for
an
additional
peremptory
challenge.
in
fact,
he
asked
twice
for
an
additional
peremptory
challenge.
we
have
to
keep
our
eye
on
the
ball
in
my
view.
the
eye
on
the
ball
is
the
government
has
to
prove...
if
we're
dealing
with
harmless
error,
has
to
prove
the
actions
of
prejudice.
and
the
question
is
on
this
record
where
the
defendant
was
told
to
use
a
peremptory
challenge,
if
that's
what
he
wanted
to,
and
when
the
defendant
asked
for
additional
peremptory
challenges
at
the...
when
juror
finck
ended
up
missing
and
the...
on
the
first
day
of
trial
actually
objected
to
the
composition
of
the
jury,
whether
on
that
record
the
government
is
able
to
prove
an
absence
of
prejudice.
mr.
michael
gordon
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
that
had
he
been
given
the
opportunity
to
exercise
peremptory
challenges,
along
with
the
fact
that
he
had
exhausted
all
his
peremptory
challenges,
that
he
intended
to
use
the
peremptory
challenge...
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
that's...
well,
we
know
that
when
the
defense
counsel
and
the
government
are
exercising
peremptories,
they
focus
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
panel.
i
mean,
that's...
they're...
they're
looking
at
the
most
likely
jurors
to
end
up
sitting
on
the
petit.
the
fact
that
the...
that
juror
at
the
very
end
may
have
ended
up
sitting
there
was
an...
was
really
just
an
act
of
fortuity
that
that
juror...
mr.
michael
gordon
and
i
agree
with
that.
but
my
point
is
that,
a,
the
defendant...
or
the
defense
counsel
in
this
case,
the
trial
counsel
in
this
case,
could
have
speculated
very
correctly
that
that
juror
was
not
likely
to
sit
on
the
petit
jury...
mr.
michael
gordon
petit
jury?
petit
jury
and,
b,
that
he...
and,
b,
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
exercise
that
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
michael
gordon
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
disagree
with
that.
we...
we...
i
think
what
you're...
and
the
amici...
mr.
michael
gordon
the
part...
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i'll
leave
that
for
you
to
decide.
[laughter]
the
amici
points
out
i
think
quite
accurately
that
we
must
distinguish
between
pointing
out
the
error
and
pointing
out
the
consequences
of
the
error.
in
this
case
when
the
district
court
denied
the
peremptory
challenge...
or
the
for-cause
challenge,
the
only
logical
consequence
is
that
defendant
was
going
to
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge
to
remove
that.
and
in
fact,
we
know
from
the
record
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
anticipated
when
the
defense
counsel
moved
to
strike
that
juror
for
cause.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
that
next...
well,
that's
the
harm.
the
harm
of
the
error...
mr.
michael
gordon
no,
i
don't
think
that's...
i
don't
think
there
was
any
other
error.
i
think
the
other...
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
the
consequence
of
that
error.
i
think
it's...
it's
really...
it's
playing
with
words
a
little
bit
because
the
consequence
of
the
error
is
the
denial
of
the
peremptory
challenge
rights,
and
that
it's
a
natural
consequence
and
it's
the
only
consequence
that
can
flow
from
a...
from
the
denial
of
a
for-cause
challenge
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
gordon
justice
scalia,
i
think...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
believe
we
need
to
understand
the
value
of
the
jury
system.
the
reason
why
we
have
a
jury
system
is
because
we
have
a
healthy
disrespect...
or
a
healthy
respect
for
the
distance
between
the
court
and
a
jury.
it's
a
buffer
for
the
defendant.
during
the
trial,
rule
24
plays
a
very
subtle
role
in
that
healthy
distance
between
the
two
of
them.
the
district
court
makes
objective
review
of
prospective
jurors.
the
defendant,
sitting
with
his
defense
counsel,
has
the
opportunity
to
disagree
with
those
rulings,
and
when
he
does
disagree,
the
peremptory
challenge
gives
him
that
right.
but
when
the
district
court
is
incorrect
on
an
objective
viewing,
as
was...
as
is
conceded
in
this
case,
the
error
must
be
reversed.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
receives
no
windfall
under
the
government's
second
fall-back
position
and
third
fall-back
position
precisely
because
the
conviction
would
have
been
reversed
under
this
court's
decision
in
ross
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
michael
gordon
the
play
that
you
speak
of
i
think
is
important,
but
i
think
the
play
is
resolved
in
the
highly
deferential
standard
of
review
given
to
the
district
court
when
it
reviews
those
sorts
of
errors.
mr.
michael
gordon
if
the
defendant
would
have
left
the
peremptory
challenge
and
used
his
peremptory
challenge
on
another
juror,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
prospective
juror
gilbert
would
have
become
a
juror
who
sat
on
the
alternate
jury.
under
the
court's
decision
in
ross
v.
oklahoma,
although
those
weren't
the
facts
of
the
specific
case...
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i'm
assuming
two
things.
number
one,
i'm
assuming
that
the
government's
concession
would
hold
true
at
the
appellate
court
level,
that
the
juror
that
actually
sat,
juror
gilbert,
then
would
have
sat
under
your
hypothetical,
and
we
would
have
had
a
fair...
or
rather,
an
unfair
and
partial
juror
sit
on
the
jury
panel.
and
that,
from
my
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
ross,
is
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
right
to...
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
that
sat.
ultimately
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
because
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
whether
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
rule
that
rule
24
actually
embraces
this
notion
of
whether
the
defendant
is
required
to
remove
those
jurors...
mr.
michael
gordon
i...
i
think
that
in
the
sense
that
if
you
put
a
gun
to
somebody's
head,
then
he
got
all
10
peremptories.
he
was
forced
to
use
it
in
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
word.
the
defendant
was
on
trial
and
facing
a
score
or
more
of
years
in
prison.
if
he
wanted
to
have
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
we
now
at
least
know
in
retrospect
that
the
judge,
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
abused
his
discretion.
he
let
a
juror
sit
who
said
he...
mr.
michael
gordon
no,
it
was
not.
at
the
court
of
appeals,
in
fact,
that
was
the
only
position
the
government
took,
that
the
district
court
had
not
abused
its
discretion,
and
juror
gilbert...
or
the
removal...
failure
to
remove...
i
apologize...
prospective
juror
gilbert
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
michael
gordon
the
court
of
appeals
held
otherwise
in
this
case.
and
it's
only
upon
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc
at
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
that
the
government
changed
its
position
and
actually
flip
in
the
case
and
say...
where
it
said
at
the
ninth
circuit
we
agree
that
the
court
abused
its
discretion,
we
think
that
violates
due
process,
and
then
at
the...
at
this
level
the
court
took...
the
government
took
the
opposite
position
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
do.
i
mean,
i
think
that...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
agree,
but
i
think
the
cases
this
court
has
decided,
for
example,
logan
v.
zimmerman,
for
example,
hicks
v.
oklahoma...
what
we
can
glean
from
those...
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i
agree.
i
think...
i
think
this
case
goes
to
those
cases
way
out
on
the
margin.
what
we're
looking
at
is
the...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
i
can
speak
to
that.
i
think
that...
mr.
michael
gordon
well
then,
no.
[laughter]
the...
i
think
what
we
can
glean
from
logan
v.
zimmerman
and...
and
hicks
v.
oklahoma
are
when
there
are
important
rights
at
stake...
and,
indeed,
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
rights
afforded
to
the
criminal
defendant...
that
a
denial
of
that
right
does
rise
to
procedural
due
process
levels.
mr.
michael
gordon
i...
i
agree.
and
i...
i
don't
think
it's
necessary...
and
i
hope
i
set
forth
that
clearly
in
our
brief.
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
we
have
a...
a
procedural
due
process
violation
in
order
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
it
would
be
obviously
affirmed
on
different
grounds
in
that
way.
but
if
we
find
that
it's
a
rule
24
violation,
we're
going
to
leapfrog
into
a
very
difficult
area
i
think
and
that
area
is
dealing
with
the
structural
error
versus
non-structural
error
and
the
appropriate
harmless
error
standard.
and
then
the
court
is
faced
with
those
two
very
diverging
options,
one...
mr.
michael
gordon
no.
i
was
just
going
to
say
one
that
requires
reversal
almost
all
of
the
time
once
we...
once
we
get
past
that
very
discretionary
standard
of
review,
and
one
that
requires
a
finding
of
harmlessness
all
the
time
once
we...
unless
the
district
court
makes
the
unfortunate
series
of
10
rulings
erroneously
on...
on
for-cause
challenges.
i'm
sorry
for
interrupting.
mr.
michael
gordon
justice
souter,
you
raise
a
good
point.
it's
a
very...
the
answer
is
i
couldn't
find
any
case
in
that
regard.
mr.
michael
gordon
and
i
think
the...
the
reason
why
this
case
is
different
is
we
can
look
at
the
peremptory
challenge
as
truly
a
unique
tool
in
the
creation
of
a
jury.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think
the
number
of
peremptory
challenges
is
a
decision,
chief
justice,
that
has
to
be
left
to
the
grace
of
congress
in
this
case.
and
if
we're
going
to
change
the
number
of
peremptory
challenges,
as
proposed
by
the
government,
by
requiring
that
the
defendant
affirmatively
really
engage
in
his
own
prosecution
and
clean
up
sixth
amendment
violations,
then
we're
requiring...
or
modifying
rule
24
in
a
very
substantive
and
drastic
way.
and
we
have
procedures
under
i
believe
it's
title
28
that
allow
the
court
to
recommend
changes
to
rule
24
and
then
allow
congress
to
reject
or
accept
those
modifications.
and
we
know
that
that
procedure
has
been
employed
in
the
last
20
years.
we
know
that
rule
24
has
been
modified
since
swain's
decision
in
1965.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think
the
focus,
justice
ginsburg,
is
not
on...
necessarily
on
the
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
although
i
think
that's
important...
mr.
michael
gordon
correct,
and
i
think
that's
true.
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
rule
52,
we
speak
to
an
effect
on
a
substantial
right.
the
substantial
right
involved
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
a
peremptory
challenge.
what
we're
doing
i
think
if
we
adopt...
mr.
michael
gordon
yes.
i
think
that...
in
my
view.
and
i
think
in
this
court's
view...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
agree
with
you,
it
can't
be.
and
i
hope
that's
not
what
i
said.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this
court
has
ruled
continuously
since
the
last
century
and
up
through
holland
in
this
case
that
the
right
to
a
peremptory
challenge
is
an
essential
right
afforded
to
the
accused
during
the
jury
trial
process.
and
the
reason
why
it's
essential
is
that
it
allows
the
defendant
to
play
a
role
in
his
jury
selection
outside
the
role
of
the
judge.
it
really
furthers
the
goal
of
a
trial
by
jury
in
that...
in
that
respect.
and
we've
recognized...
this
court
has
continually
recognized
that
a
trial
by
jury
deserves
a
peremptory
challenge.
in
fact,
this
court
in
holland
stated
that
although
the
court
previously
in
stilson
said
it
was
not
a
necessary
right
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it
arguably
is
a
substantive
right
and
that
the
right
is
so
essential
that
it
does
not...
the
right
to
peremptory
challenge...
it
cannot
be
trumped
by
the
sixth
amendment,
for
example,
in
holland.
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i
think
that
i'm
not
saying
that
due
process
would
always
require
10
peremptories.
the
decision
as
to
whether...
or
as
to
the
number
of
peremptory
challenges
offered
to
the
criminal
defendant
is
a
decision
made
by
the
legislature,
in
this
case
congress.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that.
i
think
it's
not
a
matter
of
it
not
being
observed.
it's
a
matter
of
it
being
arbitrarily
denied.
and
when
we
speak
to
an
arbitrary
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
the
district
court
denying
the
for-cause
challenge.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think
when...
i
don't
agree
with
the
concept.
i
think
when
the
district
court
makes
a...
abuses
its
discretion,
it
makes
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
decision,
as
evidenced
by
the...
the
standard
of
review
in
this
case,
and
denies
a
for-cause
challenge
after
the
defendant...
after
the
prospective
juror
in
the
case
states
that
he
would
favor
the
prosecution
and
never
effectively
in
any
way
retreat
from
that
position,
it
is
in
fact
an
arbitrary
denial.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think
that
is
perfectly
acceptable
depending...
well,
your
hypothetical
is,
chief
justice,
that
the
rule
has
been
amended,
and
i
think...
mr.
michael
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
michael
gordon
i
agree,
and
i
think...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
agree.
i
was...
i...
what
we
need
to
do
is...
what
i
needed
to
do
is
understand
the
chief
justice's
position
that
it
was
an
amended
rule
and
it
was
amended
appropriately.
and
so
long
as
the
rule
in
my
view
is
amended
by
congress,
or
at
least
amended
under
the
procedures
set
forth
by
congress,
then
there
would
be
no...
certainly
no
procedural
due
process
violation.
we...
i
mean,
we
need
to...
all
we
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
cases
from
late
last
century
and
early
this
century.
in
every
instance,
this
court
looked
at
whether
peremptory
challenges
provided
the
defendant
with
the
essential
right
to
de-select
those
jurors,
and
the
court
in
those
cases
that
it
did,
it
held...
mr.
michael
gordon
but
the
court
in
those
cases
weren't
reversing
the
convictions.
in
every
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
other
than
harrison
v.
the
united
states,
the
court
said
there
was
no
error
made
when
the
defendant
was
forced
to
de-select
the
proper
jurors
and
precisely
for
two
reasons.
one,
it...
the
court
looked
at
the
nature
of
peremptory
challenges,
and
when...
when
that
was
not
undermined,
the
court
didn't
reverse
the
conviction.
and
number
two,
the
court
looked
at
the
very
terms
of
the
statutes
involved,
the
rules
of
procedure
involved
there
and...
and
stated
that
the
defendant
received
precisely
what
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
federal
rules...
under
those
rules
of
procedure.
they
weren't
federal
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
gordon
well,
let
me
just
state
it
this
way.
in
order
for
the
rule
to
be
expressly
approved
by...
or
in
order
for
the
rule
to
be
amended,
it
has
to
be
expressly
approved
by
congress.
the
other
alternative
is
we're
looking
at
rule
24
as
it
now
exists
today
without
the
modification.
assuming,
i
think
appropriately,
that
our
interpretation
is
correct,
the
deprivation
of
the
right
violates
the
rule,
the
procedures
set
forth
under
rule
24.
nonetheless...
mr.
michael
gordon
i
think
the...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
there
are...
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
there
are
some
cases
more
on
the
fringe
when
we're
dealing
with
very
fundamental
rights
where
the
erroneous
denial
of
a
procedural
right
can
rise
to
a
procedural
due
process
violation.
and...
and
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
i
think
all
we
need
to
do
is
decide
that
rule
24,
if
it
were
to
be
amended,
ought
to
be
amended
in...
in
accordance
with
procedure
and
that
we
had
a
violation
of
rule
24
in
that
instance.
mr.
michael
gordon
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case
is
that
he...
we...
they...
i
wasn't
part
of
the
trial.
they
exercised
their
peremptory
challenge
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
voir
dire
in
this
case.
