so,
there's
never
any
prejudice.
there
will
never
be
any
prejudice.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but...
but
that...
that's
because
he
is
accepting
a
juror
who
should
have
been
excused
for
cause.
there
will
never
be
any
prejudice
from,
in
effect,
the
abridgement
of
the...
the
peremptory
challenge
right
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in...
in
effect,
you...
that...
that
says,
forget
peremptories.
the...
the
only
issue
that
you
can
pursue
is
the
issue
of
a
biased
juror
whom
you
have
claimed
should
have
been
excused
for
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
it
says,
forget
them
if
the
judge
doesn't
let
you
have
them
because
the
only
issue
that
can
be
pursued
is
the
issue
of
the
biased
juror
who
should
have
been
excused
for
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
he...
what
if
he
doesn't...
what
if
he,
in
fact,
goes
to
trial?
i
take
it
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
would
get
no
relief
on
your
theory,
absent
the
seating
of
a
biased
juror
who
should
have
been
excused
for
cause
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
nothing...
you...
you
don't
want
anything
to
turn
on
whether
he
requested
a
further
perempt,
do
you?
because
if
anything
does,
everybody
is
going
to
request
a
further
perempt
and
then
we're
going
to
have
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
a
question
just
about
the
terms
of
the
rules.
in
a
case
like
this
where
there
are
multiple
defendants,
i...
i
guess
it's
clear
that
the
judge
could
have
given
further
perempts,
could
have
allowed
more
beyond
the...
what
was
it...
10?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
single
defendant,
does
the
judge
have
any
discretion
to
increase
the
number?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
under
the
terms
of
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
he
asked
for
a
further
perempt,
wasn't
it
because
a
juror
had
been
excused
and
was
going
to
be
replaced?
was
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
the
case,
isn't
it,
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that
at
the
time
the
original
panel
selection
plus
the
selection
of
an
alternate
was
concluded,
your
client
did
not
at
that
point
go
to
the
court
or
his
counsel
didn't
go
to
the
court
and
say,
judge,
i
want
to
exercise
one
more
peremptory?
i
can't
do
so
because
you
forced
me
to
use
it
to...
to
strike
the
juror
whom
i
object
to
for
cause.
he
did
not
do
that.
