mr.
dreeben,
what
if...
justice
antonin
scalia
would
he
get
a
reversal
on
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
the
issue.
you...
you
would
say
still
no
reversal...
justice
antonin
scalia
on
appeal
unless
there's
been
a...
what
if...
what
if...
i
take
it
to
be
the
government's
position
that
peremptories
must
be
used
to
strike
a
biased
juror.
suppose...
suppose
counsel
is
so
certain
that
a
biased
juror
is...
is
being
seated
over
his
objection
that
he
does
not
use
his
last
peremptory
to
strike
that...
that
biased
juror.
he
says,
i'm
going
to
use
this
peremptory
for
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
biased
juror
is...
is
then
seated.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
he...
that
there's
no
harm
because
he
had
a
peremptory
which
he
could
have
used
to
strike
that
biased
juror?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
we...
we
could...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
retreat
that
far
in
order
to
overcome
the
objection
that
justice
o'connor
and
i
find
rather...
rather
significant.
that
is
to
say,
you
can
still
maintain
your
first
position
on
harmless
error
without
going
the
further
step
to
say,
moreover,
even
when
a
biased
juror
is
seated,
when
you
had
one
peremptory
left
that
you
could
have
used
to
strike
him,
that...
that
is
harmless
error.
i
mean,
that...
that
goes
beyond
what...
it
seems
to
me
what
you...
what
you
need
to
say
in
order
to
sustain
this
case
under
your...
under
your...
your
primary
theory.
your
primary
theory
is
if
a
biased
juror
is
seated,
there's
harm.
and
in
the
hypothetical
i've
given
you,
biased
juror
has
been
seated,
but
you're
trying
to,
you
know,
take
a
bigger
bite
and
say,
moreover,
it
doesn't
even
matter
if
a
biased
juror
is
seated
so
long
as
you
had
a
peremptory
left
which
you
could
have
used
to
strike
him.
i...
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
go
that
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
fall
back
all
the
way
to
your
second
theory.
you
can
still
use
your
first...
your
first
biased
juror
theory
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no.
you
have
to
go
further
than
that,
or
to
put
it
another
way,
whether
if
he
doesn't
challenge
it
and
fails
to
use...
if
he
does
challenge
it,
but
fails
to
use
his
peremptory
to
get
rid
of
it,
he's
been
injured.
i
mean,
the
oklahoma
rule
is
you
must
use...
you
must
use...
a
peremptory,
which
is
the
rule
you're
arguing
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
you're
talking
about...
about
the
oklahoma
rule
and
you're
saying
that
the
federal
statute
should
be
interpreted
the
same
way,
i
assume
that's
how
you
want
us
to
interpret
the
federal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
where...
where
a
biased
juror
has
been
seated,
yes,
you...
you
would
be
able
to
claim
that
this
error
was
harmful,
but...
but
that
ability
is
totally
superfluous.
it
doesn't
give
you
anything
you
wouldn't
have
without
it
anyway
because
you'd
be
able
to
say
the
juror
should
have
been
excused,
and
the
error
was
failure
to
grant
the
motion
to
strike
for
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
why
shouldn't...
why
shouldn't
your
client
have
been
put
to
the...
to
the
hard
choice
of
if
he
was
so
sure
about...
about
the
impropriety
of
seating
this
juror,
he
shouldn't
have
wasted
one
of
his
peremptories.
it
was
really
your
choice
to
shoot
the
peremptory
on
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
again,
the...
the
government
isn't...
doesn't
have
to
say
that
you...
you
were
forced
to
use
it.
they're
not...
they
don't
need
oklahoma's
position.
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
you
had
to
waste
your
peremptory.
the
fact
is
you
chose
to
use
your
peremptory
that
way.
question:
did
you
get
10
peremptories
answer:
you
got
10
peremptories
you
chose
to
waste
one
of
them
to
strike
a
juror
who
would
have
been...
should
have
been
disqualified
for
cause
anyway.
your
remedy
for
that
problem,
if
you
were
so
sure
about
it,
was
to
get
the
case
reversed
on
appeal,
but
you
chose
to
use
one
of
your
10
peremptories.
it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
been
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
your
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
petit
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
the
only
consequence
when
you
choose
to
use
one
of
your
peremptories.
i'm...
i'm
less
interested
in
the
harmless
error
issue
than
i
am
in
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
rule
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
we've
been
discussing
the...
you
know,
the
question
of
whether...
whether
the
judge
excuses
somebody
for
cause
or
not
as...
as
being
a
black
and
white.
you
have
this
category
of
jurors
who
should
be
stricken
for
cause
and
all
the
rest
who
shouldn't
be
stricken
for
cause.
in
the
real
world,
it...
it's
not
all
that
clear.
maybe
it
is
on
review,
but
when
it
comes
before
the
trial
judge,
it's
a
spectrum.
and...
and
some
of
them
could
go
into
either
category.
why
isn't
it
realistic
to...
to
view
rule
24
as
saying,
look
it,
if
you're
in
some
doubt
as
to
whether
this
clearly
falls
into
the
category
where...
where
he
should
have
been
stricken
for
cause,
that's
one
of
the
things
your
peremptories
is
for?
and
you
used
it
that
way
here
and
you
got
your
full
10
peremptories.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
violation
of
the
rule.
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
upon
whether
you
view
the
purpose
of
rule
24
as
embracing
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
strike
those
jurors
who
are...
you
know,
maybe
should
have
been
excused
for
cause,
maybe
shouldn't.
if
you
view
the
purpose
of
rule
24
as
being,
you
know,
to
allow
that...
that
play
in
the
joints,
then
it
seems
to
me
there
has...
there
has
simply
been
no
violation
of
it.
you
use...
you
use
the
peremptory
for
exactly
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
designed,
to
take
care
of
these
doubtful
cases
where
maybe...
maybe
he
should
have
been
stricken
for
cause,
maybe
he
shouldn't.
but
you
have
your
peremptory
if
you
choose
to...
i'm
not
saying
you
must
use
it
that
way,
but
if
you
choose
to
use
it
that
way,
which
is
what
this
case
involves.
you
got
your
10
peremptories.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
used
the...
the
structural
error
concept
in
a
context
other
than
a
constitutional
one?
have
we
ever
used
it
to
find
a...
a
statutory...
a
harmful
statutory
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there
is
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
not
a
hard
question.
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
said
several
times
that
you
don't
constitutionally
have
to
have
any
peremptory
challenges
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
give
10
but
say
you
got
to
use
them
to
correct
any
errors
by
the
judge,
how
could
that
possibly
be
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gordon,
maybe
i
shouldn't
waste
your
time
with
this
because
you're
not
relying
exclusively
on
the
constitutional
violation.
but
i
don't
understand
how
there
can
be
a
constitutional
violation
if
you
accept
that
the
rule,
as
rewritten
pursuant
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
would
be
constitutional;
that
is,
if...
if
what
the
government
argues
had
been
written
into
the
statute,
you
acknowledge
that
would
be...
that
would
be
constitutional.
but
you
say
that
since
it
is
not
written
into
the
statute,
to
interpret
the
statute
that
way
would
somehow
be
unconstitutional
or...
or
how
can
you
get
a
constitutional
violation
once
you
acknowledge
that
this
could
happen
if
expressly
approved
by
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
see
that
argument,
but
i
can't
see
the
further
step:
and
violates
the
constitution
