we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
98-1255,
united
states
v.
abel
martinez-salazar.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
you...
you
mentioned
i
think
peremptory
challenge
right
impairment.
what
is
the
source
of
those
peremptory
challenge
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
then
it
really
is
impossible
to
justify
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
if
there's
a
constitutional
question
here
where
we're
talking
about
federal
rules.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
government
take
any
position
as
to
the
purpose
of
a
peremptory
challenge
provided
by
the
rules?
is
it
just
to
obtain
an
impartial
jury,
or
is
it
also
permitted...
is
one
of
its
permitted
uses
to
get
a
jury
that's
simply
favorable
to
the
client,
not
impartial
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
know
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
an
easier
case
for
the
government
on
appeal
if
the
juror
has
been
seated
because
of
cases
like
wainright
against
witt
where
you
defer
to
the...
the
trial
judge's
ruling
on
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
gordon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
the
error
would
not
be
harmless
where
a
biased
juror
was,
in
fact,
seated.
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's...
that's
one...
one...
that's
one
version
certainly.
now,
i
won't
say
it's
implausible.
in
the
ross
case,
oklahoma
had
a
different
version.
and
i...
i
think
some
states
follow
that.
i
mean,
it's
not
inexorable
that
one
reach
the
conclusion
you
reach
that
peremptories
are
so
valuable
that
they
should
never
have
to
be
used
to
repair
a
possible
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
the
case
would
have
been
reversed
under
ross
against
oklahoma?
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
makes
it
rather
difficult
to
say
that
if...
if
it's
a
different
case,
why
it
would
have
been
reversed
under
ross,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rule...
rule
24
on
its
face,
of
course,
doesn't
embrace
any
notion
other
than
you
get
10
peremptories.
your
client
got
10
peremptories.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
never
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
stipulated,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
otherwise
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't...
you
don't
think
this
is
a
due
process
situation,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
say
that
when
we're
talking
about
violation
of
a
rule?
we
don't
reach
constitutional
questions
if
we
can
decide
them
under
rules
or
statutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
way
out
on
the
margin
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
want
your
case
to
be
decided
in
a
way
that
is
regarded
as
way
out
on
the
margin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
a
good
advocate
would
say
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
our
jurisprudence,
you
don't
reach
any
constitutional
question
unless
you
find
that
the
statute
requires
a
particular
thing.
and
here
we're
construing
a
statute...
a
rule
that,
it
seems
to
be
generally
conceded,
could
be
construed
one
way
or
the
other.
and
if
we
can
construe
the
rule
in...
in
a
way
that
will
give
your
client
the
relief
he
seeks,
there
just
isn't
any
basis
for
a...
ross
was
constitutional
because
we
don't
have
the
final
say
about
how
the
oklahoma
statutes
are
construed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
i...
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
it
would
raise
a
grave
constitutional
question
if
a
state
abolished
peremptory
challenges
on
both
sides.
i
realize
that
that's
debatable,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to...
you
know,
if...
if
you
say
you're
entitled
to
an
unbiased
jury,
no
one
would
disagree
with
that.
but
if
you
say
you're
entitled
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness
to
10
peremptory
challenges,
i
think
a
lot
of
people
would
disagree
with
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if...
what
if
rule
24
read
that
each
side
shall
get
10
peremptory
challenges
but
those
challenges
shall
be
required
to
be
exercised
if
and
in
a
case
like
this
where
the...
the
lawyer
is
of
the
view
that
the
district
court
has
erroneously
denied
a
for-cause
challenge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
exactly.
would
that
be
a
constitutional...
could...
could
there
be
any
constitutional
challenge
to
a
rule
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the...
the
court
in
those
days
just
reversed
convictions
right
and
left
that
would
never
be
reversed
today.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.98-1255,
united
states
v.
martinez-salazar
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
