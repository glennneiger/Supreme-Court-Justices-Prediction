mr.
jim
waide
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
threw
out
this
jury
verdict
and
found
the
facts
differently
from
what
the
fifth...
from
what
the
jury
found
them,
the
court
of
appeals
offended
fundamental
principles
that
this
court
has
announced
time
and
again.
this
court
time
and
again
has
said
that...
that
not
only
the
facts,
but
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
is
a
jury
question.
over
and
over
again
from
old
decisions,
new
decisions,
as
recently
as
1999
in
the
hunt
case
in
as
colorful
a
language
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
the
aikens
case
when
the
chief
justice
said
that
the
state
of
a
man's
mind
is
as
much
a
fact
as
indigestion.
in
justice
o'connor's
decisions,
when
she
said
again
and
again
that
when
you
eliminate
all
reasonable
explanations
in
a...
for
a
employer's
decision,
then
an
inference
can
be
rationally
drawn
that
discrimination
was
the
real
reason.
your
honor,
in
this
case
there
was
a
rational
inference.
in
fact,
the
business--
mr.
jim
waide
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
jim
waide
why
is
this
rational,
your
honor?
mr.
jim
waide
yes.
your
honor,
there
could
be,
but
in
this...
but...
but
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
we
leave
it
to
the
jury.
there
could
be
any
reason.
that's
true
of
any
factual
question.
anything
could
have
happened,
but--
mr.
jim
waide
--yes,
sir.
and,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
this
was
a
long
way
from
a
coin
flip.
in
this
case
what
happened
was
we
had
a
man
that's
57
years
old,
that's
worked
at
the
same
plant
for...
the
same
place
for
40
years.
he's
replaced
by
people
in
their
30's
who,
according
to
the
employer,
are
less
efficient.
according
to
the
employer,
they're
less
efficient.
in
addition
to
that,
we
introduced
evidence
that
the...
the
younger
supervisor
and
the
older
supervisor
are
treated
far
differently.
in
addition
to
that,
we
introduced
evidence
that
the
man
that's
making
the
decisions
had
absolute
power,
according
to
our
evidence.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
this
first
one
addresses
the
first
issue;
that
is,
what
evidence
is
necessary
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury.
that's
the
first
one,
but
they
do
all
blend
together,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
we
think
it's
very
important
that
we
do
because
this...
this
test
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
of
all
evidence...
what
it's
resulted
in
is
the...
is
the
judge
is
accepting
as
true
the
evidence
that
the
jury
didn't
believe.
mr.
jim
waide
it's
supposed
to
be,
your
honor,
but
in
practical
effect,
when
they
start
considering
all
the
evidence,
when
they
say,
for
example,
in
this
case
we
say
that
mr.
chestnut...
this
is
a
fellow
that
wrote
his
supposed
boss,
the
one
they
claimed
was
his
boss,
and
said,
wake
up
and
learn
to
do
your
job.
we
think
the
jury
was
entitled
to
believe
that,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
fifth
circuit,
because
they
consider
all
the
evidence,
they
say,
oh,
no,
ms.
sanderson
made
the
decision.
that's
where
we
get
into
problems.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor...
your
honor,
i
do...
respectfully,
i
do
believe
that
it
makes
a
difference
because
whenever
you
say
all
the
evidence,
that
leaves
you
open
to
take
evidence
the
jury
didn't
believe.
now,
there...
i
know
it's
got
the
other
phrase
in
it
which
seems
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
with
it,
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
non
moving
party.
but
we
need
to
get
rid
of
this
phrase
of
all
the
evidence.
that's
what's
causing
the
problem.
your
honor,
i'm
not
smart
enough
to
come
up
with
a
test,
but
professor
wright,
which
is
quoted
in
my...
in
my
brief,
has
got...
to
me
has
got
the
sensible
test.
we
eliminate
the
evidence
that's
contradicted,
and
otherwise...
or
impeached.
this
is
page
35
of
my
brief,
your
honor.
we
should
take
the
non
movant's
evidence,
together
with
any
evidence
from
the
other
side
that's
unimpeached,
that's
reliable
evidence.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
ma'am.
the
test
that
professor
wright...
professor
wright
studied
all
these
cases,
your
honor.
i'm
not
smart
enough
to
figure
all
this.
but
he
studied
all
this,
and
he's
taken
all
the
courts
of
appeals'
decisions
and
he
said
that
is
too
broad.
and
the
trouble
with
it
in
this
case...
and
time
and
again,
the
court
of
appeals
takes
the
evidence
that
the
jury
didn't
believe.
that's
not
consistent
with...
with
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
your
honor.
and
your
honor
just
said
in
this
weisgram
case
you
talked
about
2
weeks
ago,
where
the
appeals...
court
of
appeals
should
be
constantly
alert
to
the
trial
judge's
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
witnesses,
the
decision
maker's
feel
for
the
case.
we
ought
to
be
giving
deference
to
the
jury.
we
ought
to
be...
we
ought
to
be
paying
attention
to
what
they
found.
that's
what
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
means.
so,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
test
needs
to
be
done
away
with.
that's
the
source
of
the
problem.
that's
why--
mr.
jim
waide
--i
think
your
honor
has
already
settled
that,
that
would
have
to
be
accepted,
your
honor.
your
honor's
already...
your
honor
has
already
settled
that
question.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
you
settled
it
in
this
lesage
summary
judgment
case,
which
i
think
the
standards
are
the
same,
and
in
the
lesage
summary
judgment
case,
there
was
evidence
that
this
applicant...
he
was
saying
it
was
race
discrimination.
they
had
conclusive
evidence
he
was
like
50th
down
the
line.
he
never
would
have
gotten
into
school
anyway.
so...
so,
your
honor--
mr.
jim
waide
--conclusive
evidence--
mr.
jim
waide
--with
only
one
exception,
your
honor.
when
we
get
to
the
appeals
court
level...
when
we
get
to
the
appeals
court
level,
in
the
summary
judgment
standard,
there's
a
de
novo
review.
we
review
de
novo.
that's
appropriate
because
it's
on
the...
it's
on
the
record.
it's
on
the
papers.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
he...
we've
got
a
jury
that
sat
here
and
listened
to
the
witnesses
one
by
one.
a
trial
judge,
very
experienced
trial
judge,
good
trial
judge
listened
to
the
witnesses
one
by
one.
he
says
there's
enough
evidence.
there
ought
to
be
deference
given
to
that
determination.
mr.
jim
waide
you're
not
supposed
to,
but...
your
honor,
but
in
fact
they
are.
that's
what
has
to
have
happened.
there's
no
other
way
this
verdict
could
have
come--
mr.
jim
waide
--well,
your
honor,
it...
it's
called
a
matter
of
law,
but
in
fact
it's
an
evaluation
of
evidence.
it's
called
a
matter
of
law
to
make
it
appealable,
but...
make
it
a
question
of
law
for
appeal.
but
in
fact
it's
an
evaluation
of
the
evidence.
mr.
jim
waide
yes.
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
i...
i
know
your
honors
have
said,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
they
have
to
give
deference
when
they're
reviewing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
but
i
believe
that
the
same
rationale
applies
because,
your
honor,
the
jury
and
the
trial
judge
heard
the
witnesses.
they...
they
heard
the
witnesses.
therefore,
we
should
give
the
deference
to
what
they
thought
about
the
testimony.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
i
hate
to
say,
as
justice
scalia
said
in
a
law
review
article
i
just
wrote,
i
hate
to
say
never.
you
know,
i
can't
say
there's
not
some
extreme
case
to
everything.
so,
i
can't
say
that
we
can't
come
up
with
some
extreme
case.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
if
we
have
a
situation
like
we
have
in
this
case,
where
we've
disproved...
we've...
we've
done
all
we...
i
mean,
justice
scalia
says,
well,
maybe
they
just
didn't
like
him.
well,
your
honor,
the
jury
saw
mr.
reeves.
he's
one
of
the
most
likeable
fellows
i
ever
met.
he's
worked
there
for
40
years.
what
do
they
mean
they
didn't...
that
the
jury
might
have
said
that
they
just
didn't
like
him?
the
jury
didn't
believe
that.
they
saw
him.
how
could
anybody
not
like
mr.
reeves?
so,
that
is
a...
that
is
an
inference
that
the
jury
was
entitled
to
draw,
that
he's
a
very
likeable
fellow,
and
the
reason
they
fired
him
was
account
of
his
age.
and
he
made
those
age
comments
corresponding
with
about
the
time
they
started
this
investigation,
which
i
believe...
which
the
jury
believed...
doesn't
matter
what
i
believe...
was
a
big
line
of
hoax.
and
that's
what
the
jury
was
entitled
to
find.
and
it's
very
rational,
your
honor,
to
say
that
we
proved
he's
57,
we
proved
he's
worked
there
40
years,
we
proved
you
replaced
him
with
people
you
admit
that
are
less
efficient.
it's
very
rational
to
say,
well,
you
fired
him
on
account
of
his
age,
especially
when
you
start
lying
about
who
made
the...
who
made
the
decision.
and
the
real
decision
maker
was
the
fellow
that
made
the
age
comments.
your
honor,
this
case...
this
case--
mr.
jim
waide
--no,
your
honor.
i...
i
believe
we
have
to
introduce
evidence
not
only...
we
get
beyond
a
mistake
in
business
judgment.
we
introduced
evidence
that
they
lied
about
it,
not
that
they
had
some
disagreement
or
some
business
judgments
mr.
smith
caused,
and
as
district
judge
senter
correctly
instructed
the
jury,
not
that
they
just
had
a
disagreement
about
whether...
whether
he
was
making
these
falsifications
of
time
records
or
not,
we...
we
introduced
evidence
to
find
it
was
all
a
big
hoax.
it
was
a
lie.
and
once
they
find
it's
a
lie
and
once
we
introduce
evidence
that
points
to
age,
such
as
age
statements,
and
they
don't
introduce
anything
else...
they
never
came
in
and
gave
any
explanation
about
why
they
lied,
and
they
were
caught
lying
time
and
time
again...
then
it's
rational
for
the
jury
to
infer
that
it
was
age.
your
honor--
mr.
jim
waide
--we--
mr.
jim
waide
--we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir,
so
long
as
it's
a
showing
not...
that
it's...
that
it's...
that
has
mendacity.
i
call
it
lies
because
i'm
not...
we
got
to
show
that
they
lied
about
it.
i
think,
your
honor,
as
a
general
rule
that
would
be
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
jim
waide
no,
sir.
mr.
jim
waide
as
long
as
a
plaintiff
introduces
evidence
of
it,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
court
can't
waive
the
evidence
and
say,
you
know,
they
still
claim
they
weren't
lying,
that
they
were
telling
the
truth.
but
we
introduced
evidence
that
they
were.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
jim
waide
sure,
we
may
lose.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor...
your
honor,
when
justice
scalia
wrote
the
opinion
in
just...
everybody
thought...
they
told
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers,
well,
that's
a
very
bad
opinion
for
you
all,
isn't
it?
i
said,
actually
i
think
that's
a
great
opinion
because
it
lets
the
jury
decide.
you
know,
everybody
was
patting
justice
souter
on
the
back
and
saying
we
should
have
gone
with
him,
but
it
was...
this
was
the
opinion
that
lets
the
jury
decide.
we
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination.
so,
we...
we
prove
it's
false
and
then
it's
a
jury
question.
your
honor,
justice
scalia
asked
a
while
ago
is
there
anything
left,
any
limits
on
interstate
commerce?
i'd
like
to
ask
is
there
any
limits
on
what...
anything
left
the
jury
is
to
do?
are
they
just
figureheads?
do
they
have
anything
they
can
do?
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
drew
inferences
in
the
defendant's
favor.
they
take
the
evidence
favoring
the
defendant
such
as,
well,
you
had
three
people
because
they
believed
it
was
three
people
involved,
and
they
were
also...
we
just
draw
the
inference
that
it
wasn't
age
discrimination.
that's
just
totally
contrary
to
the
seventh
amendment.
your
honor,
if
your
honors
have
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honor,
mr.
smith's
argument
demonstrates
why
this
is
a
jury
question,
your
honor.
the
jury
hears
the
witnesses
one
by
one
over
a
4-day
trial.
mr.
smith
comes
in
and
tries
to
tell
this
court,
which
is
accepted
in
the
court
of
appeals,
what
the
facts
were
in
the
case.
there's
no
way
to
do
it.
there's
no
way
that
a
court
of
appeals
can
understand
the
facts
of
the
case
the
way
a
jury
can
when
it's
heard
the
case,
heard
the
witnesses
one
by
one.
i
want
to
point
out
just
a
few
of
the
things,
your
honors,
that
he
said
are
just
blatantly
wrong.
it's
not
true.
it's
not
what
the
jury
found.
and
just
the
thing
is
most...
that's
most
striking
about
this
case,
when
they
had
the
man
that
made
the
age
statements,
mr.
chestnut,
they
made
this
totally
fabricated
effort
to
say
that
he
wasn't
the
man
making
the
decision.
and
we
introduced
a
letter.
here's
a
letter
we
put
in
evidence
that
the
jury
had
time
to
sit
there
and
read
and
digest
and
consider
the
significance
of
this.
he
writes
his
boss
a
letter.
supposed
to
be
his
boss.
and
he
uses
curse
words.
i'm
here
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
so
i
won't
purport
to
say
what
he
said,
but
he
said
when
are
you
going
to
wake
up
and
learn
to
do
your
job.
that's
what
he's
telling
his
boss.
and
two
people,
not
just
mr.
reeves,
but
the
young
supervisor
said
he's
the
absolute
power.
you
have
to
please
him
to
keep
your
job.
the
jury,
your
honor,
is
entitled
to
draw
the
inference
that
mr.
chestnut
is
running
the
show,
that
he's
in
charge.
the
jury
saw
them
both
on
a
witness
stand.
she
sat
up
there.
he
quotes
her
at
length.
it
is
like
she
had
memorized
her
testimony.
she's
a
meek,
mild
person.
he
gets
up
there
and
he's
like
the
tyrant.
the
jury
sees
that.
they
can
understand
who's
running
the
show.
they're
in
the
best
position
to
make
that
decision.
they
had
that...
they
had
that
within
their
discretion
to
make
that
decision.
this
business...
the
first
thing
he
said
was,
the
fact
is
he
answered
those
questions
wrong,
justice
ginsburg.
if
your
honor...
when
your
honor
reads
the
record,
you'll
see
that's
not
right.
it's
not
the
attorney's
testimony
as
to
what...
what's
in
the
record.
it's
the
jury's
decision
to
make.
and
the
testimony
i
believe
you'll
find
is
uncontradicted
to
the
contrary,
that
in
fact,
mr.
caldwell
wrote
mr.
reeves
a
note
and
told
him
to
give
this
lady
the
credit
for
these
2
days
she
was
in
the
hospital.
he
acted
based
on
the
note
that
caldwell
told
him,
and
the
company
knew
that.
and,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
these
questions
about,
well,
they
fired
caldwell,
we
don't
know
why
they
fired
caldwell.
we
didn't
try
the
caldwell
case.
caldwell's
wife
works
at
the
plant.
i
can
tell
you
a
hundred
reasons.
they
might
have...
and
your
honors...
courts
may
be
estranged
to
this,
but
juries
that
work
in
factories
know
what
happens
all
the
time.
they
tell
the
supervisor,
you
fire
jones
and
if
you
don't
fire
him,
you're
fired.
we
don't
know
what
happened.
we
didn't...
we
weren't
there.
we
didn't
try
that
case.
that
question...
we
can't
just
say,
well,
you...
that's
just
another
thing
the
jury
can
consider.
mr.
smith
can
argue
that
to
the
jury.
he
can
say,
well,
they
fired
caldwell,
so
it
must
not
have
been
age.
caldwell
was
only
45.
he
can
argue
that.
let
the
jury
decide
that.
and
judge
senter
told
the
jury...
judge
senter...
further,
in
order
for
the
plaintiff
to
prevail,
he
bears
the
burden...
this
is
on
page
7
of
the
transcript
of
the
jury
charge...
he
bears
the
burden
of
proving,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
reasons
offered
for
terminating
him
were
not
the
true
reasons
but
rather
a
pretext
for
age
discrimination.
that's
what
he
told
them
that
they
had
to
prove.
this
jury
charge
is
a
model.
judge
senter's
jury
charge
ought
to
be
given
by
every
district
judge.
it's
a
model
of
what
this
court
said
you
have
to
prove,
especially
in
the
st.
mary's
case.
they
had
every
opportunity
to
prove
that
they
were
telling
the
truth,
and
the
jury
believed
they
were
lying.
the
report
they
made
up,
your
honor...
if
you
study
that...
and
it
takes
some
time
to
go
through
all
those
records.
the
court
of
appeals
judge
doesn't
have
time
to
do
that.
they
are
busy
with
more
important
things.
they
don't
have
time
to
study
those
records,
but
you
study
them
and--
mr.
jim
waide
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jim
waide
i
agree
with
that
a
hundred...
i
mean,
i
know
it's
the
law--
mr.
jim
waide
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
jim
waide
because,
your
honor,
he's...
there
has
to
be
facts
introduced
sufficient
to
allow
the
jury
to
infer
age
discrimination.
we
don't
have
to
have
direct
evidence
to
come
in
and
say,
i'm
firing
you
because
of
your
age,
but
the
jury
has
to
find
from
the
circumstantial
evidence
that
age
was
the
reason.
mr.
jim
waide
it
has
to
be
a
pretext
for
age
discrimination.
mr.
jim
waide
if...
if
he
had
come
in
there...
mr.
sanderson
had
come
in
there...
and
said,
actually
what
i
think
it
is,
i
think
mr.
reeves
has
been
going
with
my
wife
and
that's
the
reason
i
fired
him,
then
we'd
have
a
different
case.
but
they
didn't
produce
any
evidence
of
that.
we
just...
we
just
had
the...
the
evidence
that
they
fired
the
young...
it's
not
just
a
bare
bones
case.
less
efficient.
they
got
every
company
employee
said
these
young
guys
that
they
replaced,
one
after
one,
they
put
one
30-year-old,
he
couldn't
do
the
job,
they'd
move
another
one
in
there,
then
another
one.
and
less
efficient.
a
training
curve.
it's
going
to
cost
the
company
money
to
put
these
30-year-olds
in
there.
that's
what
the
jury
believed.
and
when
the
company
got
up
there
and
said
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
union
contract
because
the
workers
don't
like...
don't
like
a
supervisor
being
lenient,
i
thought
the
jury
was
going
to
laugh
out
loud.
it
can
only
be
made
seriously
to
a
court
that's
not
there
and
hasn't
heard
the
witnesses.
i
ask
your
honors
to--
mr.
jim
waide
--your
honor,
it's
presented
because...
because
the
fifth
circuit...
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
that
you've
got
to
go
further
and
prove
something
beyond.
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
jim
waide
--your
honor,
i'm
just
trying
to
give
the
court
all
the
facts
about
my
case.
but
the
fifth
circuit
did
say
that
it's
not
enough
to
prove
pretext,
and
we
think
there
is.
if
we
had
never
had
these
age
statements,
it
was
still
enough
because
the
jury
is
supposed
to
draw
the
inferences.
the
jury
draws
the
inferences.
does
the
jury
believe,
well,
it
must
not
have
been
age
because
mr.
caldwell
was
also...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
all
right.
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
getting
a
little...
i'm
saying
the
jury
had
defined
age
was
a
reason.
i'm
saying
we
don't
have
to
prove
direct
evidence.
nobody
has
to
say
it's
age,
but
the
jury
does
have
to
find
age
discrimination
is
a
reason,
like
your
honor
said
in
st.
mary's.
your
honor
said,
justice
scalia...
your
honor
said,
exactly
what
we're
saying,
in
st.
mary's,
that
the
jury,
the
fact
finder
has
to
find
it
was
age
discrimination,
and
they
did.
that's
the
jury
role.
your
honor
gave
the
jury
a
great
role
in
st.
mary's.
you
decide
whether
it
was
age
discrimination
or
not.
the
court
doesn't
decide--
mr.
jim
waide
--thank
you,
your
honor.
