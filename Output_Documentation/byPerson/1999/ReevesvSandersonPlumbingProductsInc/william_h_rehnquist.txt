hear
argument
next
in
no.
99-536,
roger
reeves
v.
sanderson
plumbing
products,
inc.--
mr.
waide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
waide,
you
presented
three
rather
specific
questions.
one
is
whether
the
prima
facie
proof
of
age
discrimination,
coupled
with
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
that
the
employee
was
not
offered
a
true
reason
for
an
adverse
employment
action,
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
jury
verdict.
then
the
second
one
is
whether
on
passing
from...
passing
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
law
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
50,
the
court
can
consider
all
the
evidence
or
just
the
evidence
favoring
the
non
moving
party.
and
then,
three,
whether
the
standard
for
granting
summary
judgment
under
rule
50
is
the
same
as
that
for
granting...
rather,
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
under
rule
50
is
the
same
as
summary
judgment.
may...
are...
are
you
addressing
each
of
those
in
turn,
or
is
this
kind
of
a
general--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
don't
blend
them
too
much
because
some
of
us
may
think
they're
separate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about...
what...
what's
your
position
on
evidence
produced
by
the
moving
party
that
is
not
impeached
or
contested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
how
did...
when
did
we
settle
it
and
how?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
then,
you
would
agree
that
the
summary
judgment
standard
is
the
same
as
the
rule
50
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you're
wrong
there,
if
i
may
say
so,
that
the...
the
trial...
at
this
stage,
when
you're
talking
about
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
you're
not
supposed
to
be
evaluating
the
truthfulness
or
the
veracity
of
the
witnesses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you're
confusing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
where
we
do...
where
the
appellate
court
is
supposed
to
give
some
deference
to
the
district
court,
where
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
which,
as
you
say,
is
de
novo.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waide.
you're
reserving
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
millett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
you...
you
say
false,
but
isn't
what
you
mean
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
jury
to
determine
falsity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
it
must
be
demonstrably
false?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
under
your
view
only
if
in
the
case
where
the
employer
comes
up
with
a
purportedly
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
the
discharge,
only
if
that
is
unchallenged
by
the
plaintiff
does
the
defendant
get
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
could
challenge
it
just
by
cross
examination
i
suppose,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
if
we
decide...
if
we
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
you're
talking
about,
we
really
didn't
need
to
grant
certiorari.
i
mean,
it
would
seem
rather
clear
that
perhaps
the
case
should
have
gone
to
the
jury.
but
the...
the
question...
the
first
question
is
a
more
specific
one
than
that,
without
the
additional
evidence
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
jury...
the
jury
is
free
to
disbelieve
even
uncontroverted...
a
witness
whose
testimony
is
not
controverted
just
because
they
think
he
might
be
telling...
telling
a
lie
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
going
to
deal
with
each
of
the
three
questions--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--presented
in
your
oral
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was...
those
were
bench...
anderson
v.
bessemer
city
was
a
bench
trial,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
that...
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
jury
trials.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but...
okay.
what
you
just
said
makes
sense.
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
i
think
is
contrary
to
our
cases
where
you
say
you're
convinced
that
a
mistake
has
been
made.
that's
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
for
reviewing
a
bench
trial
findings
by
a
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
waide,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-536
reeves
versus
sanderson
plumbing
products
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
