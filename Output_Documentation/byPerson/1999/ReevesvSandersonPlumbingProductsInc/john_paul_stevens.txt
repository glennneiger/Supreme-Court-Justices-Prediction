well,
but
isn't
there
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
about
whether
this
man
really
did
make
the
decision?
isn't
that
one
of
the
things
that's
in
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
he...
am
i
correct
that
he
was
married
to
the
person
who
owned
the
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
how
can
you
say
totally
disconnected
if
the
man
who
made
the
decision
to
fire
him
2
months
ahead
of
that
time
said,
you
came
over
on
the
mayflower
and
you're
too
old
for
the
work?
can't...
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
it
proves
anything,
but
could
the
jury
infer
that
age
had
something
to
do
with
the
decision?
