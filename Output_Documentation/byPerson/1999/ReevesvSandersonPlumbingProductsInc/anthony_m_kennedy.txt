justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
you...
you...
i
take
it
your
answer
is
that
in
this
case
you
introduced
more
than
simply
the
prima
facie
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you
introduced
more
than
simply
showing
that
the
pretext...
or
that
the
employer's
alleged
reason
was
false.
you
say
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
our
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
may
you
go
to
the
case
if
you
have
just
a
prima
facie
case
and
a
showing
that
the
employer's
asserted
reason
is
not
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then
it
depends...
it
depends
on
the...
on
the
strength
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
reputation
of
the
employer's
asserted
reasons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
take
that
rule,
together
with
the
rule
that
the
jury
is
always
free
to
disbelieve
a
witness,
then
you
can
go
to
the
jury
every
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
jury...
the
jury
charge
here
says
that
the
plaintiff
can
prove
pretext
by
showing,
one,
that
the
stated
reasons
were
not
the
real
reasons
for
the
discharge
and,
two,
that
age
discrimination
was
the
real
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
didn't...
you
didn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--must
you
have
number
two
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
number
one
sufficient
under
your
view
of
the
case?
