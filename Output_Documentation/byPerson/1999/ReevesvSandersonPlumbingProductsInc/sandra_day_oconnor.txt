mr.
waide,
is
it...
is
it
your
position
that
a
plaintiff
is
always
entitled
to
get
to
the
jury
in
a
case
like
this
if
he
establishes
that
the
employer's
stated,
articulated
reason
for
the
employment
action
is
false?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
might
be
a
third
unarticulated,
valid
reason
for
the
action
conceivably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
exactly
how
the
question
was
phrased,
unfortunately.
i
mean,
if
we
were
just
reviewing
the
verdict,
you
might
be
right.
but
it
says
basically
whether
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
plaintiff
only
produces
evidence
of
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and
that
the
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason
articulated
by
the
employer
is
false.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
bare
bones.
now,
actually
the
petitioner
says
more
evidence
was
introduced
than
that,
and
therefore,
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
for
the
jury
to
legitimately
find
as
it
did.
and
how
do
we
extract
from
the
question
presented
the
result
that
you...
you
ask
us
to
achieve?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
october
1995,
the
petitioner
roger
reeves,
a
man
of
age
57,
was
fired
by
the
respondent
sanderson
plumbing
from
his
position
as
a
supervisor.
reeves
filed
suit
claiming
he
had
been
discharged
because
of
his
age
in
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
respondent
sanderson
plumbing
in
turn
asserted
that
it
had
terminated
petitioner
because
he
had
inaccurately
recorded
the
attendance
of
the
employees
under
his
supervision.
the
case
was
tried
before
jury,
the
jury
found
the
respondent
employer
liable
for
age
discrimination.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
respondent
was
entitled
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
awarding
respondent
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
of
appeals
preceded
from
the
premise
that
a
plaintiff’s
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
combined
with
proof
that
the
employer’s
non-discriminatory
explanation
is
false,
is
always
insufficient
without
more
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
discrimination.
but
our
decision
in
an
earlier
case,
st.
mary's
honor
center
versus
hicks
makes
clear
that
such
a
showing
by
the
plaintiff
may
permit
a
reasonable
factfinder
to
infer
that
the
employer
unlawfully
discriminated.
proof
that
the
employer’s
proffered
explanation
is
unworthy
of
credence
is
simply
one
form
of
circumstantial
evidence
that
is
probative
of
intentional
discrimination
and
depending
on
the
circumstances
it
may
be
quite
persuasive.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
erred
in
assuming
that
a
plaintiff
must
always
produce
additional
independent
evidence
of
discrimination.
in
this
case,
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
after
the
jury
verdict
was
inappropriate.
in
deciding
the
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
under
rule
50
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
the
court
should
review
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
but
it
must
draw
all
reasonable
inferences
in
favor
of
the
moving
party,
and
it
may
not
make
credibility
determinations
or
weigh
the
evidence.
thus,
it
should
only
give
credence
to
the
evidence
favoring
the
non-moving
party
as
well
as
that
evidence
supporting
the
moving
party
that
the
jury
is
required
to
believe.
applying
that
standard
here,
we
find
the
district
court
was
correct
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
impermissibly
substituted
its
judgment
concerning
the
weight
of
evidence
for
the
juries.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
