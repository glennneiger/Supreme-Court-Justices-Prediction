excuse
me.
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
when
you
eliminate
all...
all
rational
reasons,
the
only
other
irrational
reason
is
discrimination?
i
mean,
there...
there
could
be...
or
age
discrimination
or
race
discrimination.
there
could
be
other
irrational
reasons.
i
just
don't
like
the
way
you
comb
your
hair.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
normally...
we
normally
don't
let
a
jury
flip
a
coin.
we...
we
normally
do
say
that,
you
know,
there
has
to
be
some...
some
basis
for
your
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
shame
on
them.
i...
i
don't
know
why
we
should...
we
should
validate
that
by
giving
it
some
special...
special
manner
of
review.
they're
supposed
to
be
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
lying,
i
mean,
you
know,
all
it
requires
is
that
the
jury
think
it
more
likely
than
not
that
the
employer's
explanation
was
not...
was
not
the
true
one.
it
might
be
close
and
the
jury
says,
well,
you
know,
on
balance
i
think
probably
that's
not
the
correct
explanation.
and
your
position
is
that
so
long
as
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made,
no
matter
how
weak
that
prima
facie
case,
once
the
jury
rejects
the...
the...
as
pretextual
the...
the
employer's
explanation,
the
verdict
has
to
go
for
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
the
jury
can...
did
not
conclude
that
it
was
true.
if
the
jury
was
in
equipoise,
the
jury
would
be
free
to
disbelieve
it
or
not
to
give
it
effect.
i
mean,
it's
not...
not
as
though
the
employer
has
been
accused...
has
been
convicted
of
lying.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
that
the...
that
the
jury
has
found
it
more
likely
than
not
that
this
is
not
the
real
excuse.
the
jury
has
simply
failed
to
find
it
more
likely
that
this
was
the
real
excuse.
you
know,
that's
not
a
whole
lot.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
it...
it
makes
it
sound
all
plausible
and
quite
reasonable
when
you
use...
use
the
expression,
a
prima
facie
case,
which
in
the
law
generally
means,
you
know,
enough
evidence
to...
to
make
it
more
likely
than
not,
without
any
other
evidence,
that
a
certain
thing
is
true.
but
in
this
area
what
we
have
called
a
prima
facie
case
is
really
something
that
is
not
very
probative
at
all,
simply
the
fact
that
you're...
you
know,
you're
within
the
protected
age
category
and
someone
younger
is
hired
to
replace
you.
do
you
really
think
that
that
makes
it
probable,
more
likely
than
not,
that
your
age
was
the
reason
for
your
dismissal?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
could
call
it
a
prima
facie
case,
but
in
the...
is
it
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
was
not
aware.
the...
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
the
more...
it's
his
burden
to
show
that
the
more
likely
explanations
for
the
firing
are
eliminated?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
qualified
doesn't
necessarily
require
him
to
come
in
and
show
that
he
was
doing
a
good
job.
it's
just
that
he
has
qualifications
for
the
job.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
we
said
it
can
get
to
the
jury
no
matter
what
other
evidence
there
is.
i
mean,
suppose
there
is
the
prima
facie
case.
he
was
qualified.
he
was
within
the
age
covered
and...
and
the
younger
man
was
hired.
suppose,
however,
it
is
shown
and
uncontroverted
that
at
the
same
time
a
younger
man
was
also
dismissed
and
replaced
by
someone
who's
even
older
than
this
plaintiff.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
then
you
mean
to
say
that
despite
that
uncontroverted
evidence,
all
we
look
to
is
simply
the
prima
facie
case.
we
look
to
nothing
on
the
other
side
at
all?
i...
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
agree
if
there's
nothing
to
counterbalance
the
prima
facie
case,
i
think
you
have
to
say
the
prima
facie
case
is
enough
to
support
a
jury
verdict.
but
when
there's
significant
uncontroverted
evidence
on
the
other
side,
is
that
necessarily
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just...
just
he
said
and...
and
she
doesn't...
doesn't
deny
it.
i
think
what
justice
ginsburg
is
saying
is
in...
in
the
hypothetical
i...
i
alluded
to
earlier,
you
can
simply
disbelieve
that
the...
that
the
employer
in
fact
hired
older
people
even
though
it's
totally
noncontroverted.
do
you...
you
think
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waide...
mr.
waide,
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
in
light
of
what...
what
all
you've
said,
i
don't
understand
why
question
one
is
even
presented
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said...
you
said
it's
been
proved.
you
said
you...
you
have
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent,
unless
you're
relying
on
the
word
direct
evidence
of
discriminatory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
said
you
agreed
with
the
statement
that...
that
the
charge
to
the
jury
was
correct,
that
you
have
to
show
that
this
was
not
the
reason
and
the
age
discrimination
was.
now
you're
telling
me
it's
enough
to
show
that
this
was
not
the
reason.
