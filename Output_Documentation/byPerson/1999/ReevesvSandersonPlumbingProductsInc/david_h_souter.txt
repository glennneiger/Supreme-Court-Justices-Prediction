what
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
make
a
suggestion
here?
aren't
you...
isn't
your
argument
depending
on
the...
on
the
requirement
for
the
prima
facie
case
that
it
be
shown
that
the
employee
who
was
fired
is,
in
fact,
competent
to
do
satisfactory...
he's
doing
satisfactory
work.
that's...
that's--
justice

h.

so,
it
literally
should
have
been
excluded
from
evidence.
that
testimony
should
have
been
kept
out
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
it's
competent.
i
mean,
your...
i
think
what
you're
arguing
is
that
a
statement
or
those
two
statements
standing
alone,
with
nothing
else
in
the
case,
would
be
insufficient
to
support
a
verdict.
but
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
that
evidence
is
inadmissible,
and
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
that
evidence
is
incompetent
in
the
sense
that
it
may
not
even
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
whole
case
in
deciding
whether
ultimately
there
was
or
was
not
age
discrimination.
and
i
think
you're
arguing
the
second
point.
i
will...
i
will
concede
the
first
point,
that
standing
alone
maybe
it's
not
enough,
but
i
think
you're
arguing
the
second
point,
that
it
is...
that
it
is
incompetent
evidence.
am
i
right
that
that's
your
argument?
