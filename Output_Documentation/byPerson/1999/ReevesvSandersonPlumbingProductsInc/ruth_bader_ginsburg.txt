justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
prevail
on
the
first
one,
do
you
need
to
go
any
further?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
has
to
be
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
non
movant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then,
maybe
they
applied
that
standard
incorrectly,
but
if
the
standard...
does
it
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
it's
all
the
evidence,
just
the
petitioner's
evidence,
just
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
so
long
as
you
must
draw
every
inference,
you
must
read
every
piece
of
testimony
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
non
movant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it
does
go
beyond
just
the
plaintiff's
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you're
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waide,
may
i
clarify
one
thing
because
justice
scalia
asked
a
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
claiming
that
if
you
have
the
prima
facie
case
and
you
have
discredited
the
employer's
proffered
reason,
that
you
win?
i
didn't
take
you
to
be
saying
that.
i
thought
what
you
were
saying
was
then
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
jury--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
that.
you
may
lose
before
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
jury
could
go
either
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
the
difference
that
the
prima
facie
case...
if
the
employer
puts
in
no
defense
at
all,
then
it
is
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
plaintiff.
once
the
employer
comes
up
with
a
reason,
then...
and
then
the
plaintiff
casts
doubt
on
that
reason,
still
the
ultimate
burden
of
showing
discrimination
is
with
the
plaintiff,
but
ordinarily,
i
think
you
said
in
your
brief,
that's
enough.
you
have...
you
can
draw
an
inference
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff...
you
can;
you
don't
have
to...
on
the
basis
of
the
prima
facie
case,
plus
the
rebuttal
of
the
defendant's
justification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
would
you
agree
that
what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
ask
on
a
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
is,
i
have
to
look
at
this
evidence
and
i
must
draw
every
inference
possible
in
favor
of
the
non
movant?
if
i
draw
every
inference
in
favor
of
the
non
movant,
is
there
a
jury
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
drawing
every
inference
from
the
evidence.
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
could
be
believed
or
disbelieved,
you
disbelieve
the
defendant
for
purposes
of
making
that
assessment,
that
you
must
draw
every
inference
from
the
evidence
favorable
for
the
plaintiff.
that
means
whenever
it
could
go
either
way,
you
must
assume
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that's
built
into
the
test
that
professor
wright...
that...
that
your
friend
quoted...
justice...
professor
wright.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
did
you
have
any
quarrel
with
that
articulation
of
the
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then
you're
both...
you're
in
agreement.
that's
great.
on
that
one
question,
you're
both
in
agreement
on
what
the
standard
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so,
then
we
can
take
what
it
says
in
wright
and
miller
and
that's
it,
and
pass
on
to
other
questions
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
it
was
not
just
mr.
reeves.
wasn't
it
the
young
man
who...
who
also
said
that
as
long
as
he's
been
with
the
company,
something
to
the
effect
that
sanderson
was
the
top
boss?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
put
on
that
defense
that
sanderson
disliked...
you
didn't
make
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
could
argue...
you
could
argue
that
to
the
jury,
but
mr.
oswalt
said
here
i
was
doing
the
same
thing
with
the
records.
we
all
were,
and
i
got
yelled
at
some,
but
boy,
they
really
gave
it
to
this
man
that
they
had
told,
when
he
was
trying
to
fix
up
a
machine,
you're
too
old
to
do
the
job.
nobody
is
suggesting
that
this
is
a
case
for
summary...
for
summary
disposition
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
only
question
is
could
the
jury
find...
make
inferences
from
that
evidence
that
the
reason
was
age
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
the
jury
can
do
nothing
with
it.
it
should
have
been
kept
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
smith,
you're
arguing
evidence.
there
was
other
evidence
that
you're
not
including
in
the
picture.
for
example,
reeves
was
first
accused
of
having
dealt
falsely
with
one
particular
employee.
well,
it
turned
out
mr.
reeves
was
in
the
hospital
on
the
days
when
she
was
supposedly
written
up
incorrectly.
there
was
also
evidence
that
these
time
clocks
didn't
work
so
well,
and
that
it
was
standard
operating
procedure
just
to
put
down
7
o'clock
when
somebody
was
at
the
work
station
at
7
o'clock.
so,
you
are
picking
out
pieces
of
the
evidence
that
tend
in
your
favor,
a
great
jury
speech.
you
are
ignoring
evidence
on
the
other
side.
and
that's
the
problem
with
this
case.
it
looks
like
it's
a
jury
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
my
first
point.
was
that
woman
who
was...
the
first...
the
first
explanation
that
sanderson
gave
is
you
put
her
down
for
being
there
and
she
wasn't.
was
mr.
reeves
in
the
hospital
when
that
occurred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
established
in...
i
thought
that
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
reeves
was
contending
he
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
was
not
the
one,
that
he
was
not
the
one
who
did
that,
that
caldwell
in
fact
did
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you're
saying
there
was
nothing
in
the
evidence
that
it
was
caldwell
who
did
it
and
not
reeves.
