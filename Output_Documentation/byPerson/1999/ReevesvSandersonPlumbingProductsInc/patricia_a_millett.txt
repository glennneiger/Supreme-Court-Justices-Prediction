ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
province
of
the
jury
to
draw
permissible
inferences
from
conflicting
evidence
presented
at
a
trial,
and
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
jury's
inference
of
age
discrimination
was
permissible.
it
was.
as
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
we
think
even...
even
if...
if
the
additional
evidence
wasn't
here,
the
outcome
would
be
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
question
of
whether
the
case
gets
to
the
jury.
and
that
is,
if...
if
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out...
that
is,
if
the...
if
the
employee
has
demonstrated
that
the
most
likely
reasons
for
the
discharge
in
this
case
were...
are
eliminated,
and
if
the
employee
also
shows
that
the
employer
in
a
court
of
law,
in
the
face
of
an
accusation
of
age
discrimination
and
with
control
over
the
relevant
information
about
the
decision,
comes
forward
with
a
false
reason
for
the
action--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry.
i
do
mean...
i
do
mean
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
infer
that
it
is
false.
and
when
they
come
forward
with
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely
not,
but
you...
in
employment...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
finding
it
more
likely
than
not
it
was
age,
they
have
also
found
it...
unless
you're
talking
about
mixed
motives.
they
have
not
found
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence...
and
they
don't
have
to.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
if
the
other
explanation
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--is
the...
is
the
correct
one,
outside
the
mixed
motives--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
if...
if
the
defendant
does
not...
i'm
sorry...
if
the
employee,
the
plaintiff,
does
not
put
in
evidence
not
only
that's
unchallenged...
they
could
challenge
it
but
not
put
in
enough
evidence
that
would
allow
a
reasonable
jury
to
disbelieve
or
to
reject
that
explanation.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
burdine,
that
a
prima
facie
case,
accompanied
by
cross
examination,
may
be
sufficient
to
establish
pretext
for
discrimination.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
what...
first
of
all--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
prima
facie
case
also
includes
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
show
that
the
most
likely
explanations
for
the
employment
action
have
been
eliminated,
and
i
think
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
price
waterhouse,
there's...
at
that
point
you
have
made
a...
almost
a
statistical
showing,
assuming
silence
by
the
employer,
that
the
more
likely
explanation
is
discrimination.
and
it's
also
important
to
keep
in--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--ultimately
at
the
end.
and
certainly
there's
really
even
no
reason
to
be
discussing
a
prima
facie
case
here.
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there...
there
are
two
things.
they
have
to
show
they
are
qualified...
that
is
another
prong
of
a
prima
facie
case...
and
that
the
position
remains
open
outside
the
rif
context.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
the
prima
facie...
and
we're...
we're
not
here
to
say
that
once...
once
an...
and
this
is
the
case
when
the
employer
has
spoken
and
has
given
an
explanation...
that
the
prima
facie
case,
all
by
itself
without
calling
into
question
in
a
way
a
jury
could...
that
would
support
a
jury
verdict...
the
employer's
explanation...
the
prima
facie
case
in
isolation
gets
you
to
a
jury.
there's
a
mandatory
legal
presumption
when
the
defendant
is
silent,
but
when
they
aren't,
then
we
have
to
look
at
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
there's
evidence
from
which
one
could
infer
discrimination.
in
that
process,
there...
there
are
two
things
in
this
case
that
make
it
a
reasonable
inference,
not
the
only
inference,
but
a
reasonable
inference:
certainly
the
falsity
or
the
discrediting
of
the
employer's
explanation,
but
also
the
fact
that
the
employee
is,
as
shown,
unqualified
for
this
job.
there...
the
job
was
still
there,
and
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
the...
the
statutes...
the
age
discrimination
act
and
title
vii...
involve
a
showing
that
you
have
a
characteristic
that
employers
historically
have
used.
it's
now
prohibited,
but
historically
and
pervasively
have
used
to
make
employment
decisions.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
i
think
the...
i
think
i...
i
think
i
mean
to
be
talking
about
the
first
question
and
that
is
in
which
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
and
that
is
whether
what
is
called
the
prima
facie
case...
the
proof
underlying
the
prima
facie
case,
combined
with
the
proof
demonstrating
the
falsity
of
the
employer's
explanations--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--those
two
alone
are
sufficient
to
create
a
reasonable
inference...
to
permit
a
reasonable
inference
by
a
jury.
and
that's
what
this
court
said--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's...
that's
absolutely
right.
we
agree
with
that.
and
what's
extraordinary
here
is
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
not
true
because
this
court
has
said
in
crawfordell
and
bose
corporation
v.
consumers
union
and
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby
a
plaintiff
cannot
just
sit
back
and,
at
summary
judgment
or
judgment
for
matter
of
law
stage,
and
say,
i've
done
nothing,
but
the
jury
could
disbelieve
the
defendant's
witnesses.
they
have
to
cross
examine.
they
have
to
put
in
counter
evidence.
but
what's
important
here
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
significant
uncontroverted
evidence
is
an
excellent
argument
to
make
to
the
jury
and
it
may
be
the
inference
that
the
jury
draws.
but
one
single
hiring
decision
is
not
sufficient
basis
for
knowing
how
this
particular
decision
was
made.
and
this
court
has
said--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--they
are
certainly
free
to
do
that.
my
only
point
was
that
at
a
summary
judgment
stage,
you
cannot
simply
respond
with
a
assertion
that
it
may
be
disbelieved.
but
what's
important
to
keep
in
mind
here
is
we're
not...
we're
talking
about...
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honors.
