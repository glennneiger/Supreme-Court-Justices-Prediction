mr.
taylor
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
today
would
like
to
revisit
three
issues
to
the
court.
number
one,
we
desire
very
briefly
to
discuss
the
standard
which
the
appellate
court
and
this
court
must
use
in
determining
whether
or
not,
under
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test,
a
matter
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
secondly,
we
want
to
revisit
and
explain
respondent's
position
as
to
its
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
this
court's
opinions
in
hicks
and
hazen
paper.
third
and
finally,
it
is
the
position
of
respondent
that
regardless
as
to
whether
this
court
accepts
what
respondent
contends
hicks
and
hazen
represent,
or
even
if
we
accept
what
we
think
is
clearly
the
erroneous
interpretation
of...
of
petitioner
and,
in
some
respects,
the
solicitor
general
as
to
the
meaning
of
hicks,
still
in
this
particular
case,
wherein
your
honors
have
held
in
other
cases
demand
individualized
proofs,
assessment
that
there
is
still
no
jury
issue.
to
go
to--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
point
one,
the
standard
of
review
under
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test,
briefly
this
court,
since
at
least
1872
and
going
through
a
month
ago
today,
has
held
and
reaffirmed
that
a
court
such
as
the
district
court
under
a
rule
50
motion,
the
appellate
court
on
review,
must
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
but
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
non
movant.
now,
we
ask
why
is
that.
the
purpose
of
that
is
in
the
improvement
company
v.
munson
case,
cited
in
the
product
liability
counsel's
brief
filed
in
support
of
respondent.
that
was
one
of
the
first
cases
where
the
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
some
evidence
that's
introduced
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
quantum
is
there
to
warrant
the
jury
determination.
and
the
court
held
there
in
improvement
company
v.
munson
that
it
was
the
function...
there
was
a
preliminary
question
for
the
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not,
under
the
substantive
law
involved,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
a
jury
determination.
i
think,
your
honor,
in...
in
the
case
of
anderson
v.
bessemer
city,
actually
cited
by
petitioner
in
his
brief
on
another
point,
is
very
determinative
of
the
fact
because
there,
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
in
determining,
under
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
that
there
were
certain
general
principles
which
must
be
reviewed
and
which
your
honors
stated
derived
from
our
cases,
one
being--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--it
was,
your
honor.
but
this
same
theory
has...
has
imbued
in
all
of
the
cases
with
regard
to
what
evidence...
what
is
the
standard,
what
evidence
is
reviewed
to
determine.
in
that
case,
as
well
i
believe
in
the
pennsylvania
v.
chamberlain,
the
court
held...
and
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
the
court
held
that
a
court
must
review
all
the
evidence
in
conjunction
with
the
substantive
law
to
determine
if
on
the
entire
evidence...
and
i
repeat
those
two
words
have
been...
have
been
stated
in
almost
all
of
your
decisions...
on
the
entire
evidence...
the
court,
the
reviewing
court,
is
left
with
the
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
well,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
in
all
of
the
cases
in
which
you've
held
that,
as
well
as
all
of
the
circuits...
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
disagreement
among
the
circuits...
that
in
order
to
determine
if
a
reasonable
and
fair
jury
could
find
in
favor
of
the
party
having
the
burden
of
producing
the
evidence,
the
court
must
review
all
of
the
evidence.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the...
the
rule
meshes
with
respect
to
the
function
of
an
appellate
court
in
determining
under
the
substantive
law
is
there
sufficient
evidence
that
would
warrant
a
fair
jury
in
reaching
a
result
in
favor
of
a
party
having
the
burden.
in--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--justice
ginsburg,
i
would
agree
with
that
with
one
caveat,
and
that
is
when
we've
used
the
word
inference,
the
inference
must
be
based
on
the
evidence
not
on
speculation
and
surmise
and
not
a
inference
upon
an
inference.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
if
it's
a
he
said/she
said,
and
the
reviewing
court
cannot
determine
which
one
is
telling
the
truth
or
which
one
is
to
be
determined,
the
fact
finder
must
do
that.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
no.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
because
your
honors
held
in
1931
in
chesapeake
&
ohio
railroad
v.
martin
that
while
a
jury
has
the
function
of
determining
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
a...
a
jury
may
not
arbitrarily
disregard
undisputed
testimony
when
there
is
no
reason
for
that.
so,
i
do
not
think--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
no.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
exactly.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
all
right.
your
honor,
let
us
now
review
and
revisit,
if
you
will,
the
respondent's
interpretation
of
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
hicks
and
hazen
paper.
initially,
to
back
up
before
hicks
and
revisit
hazen,
we
know
that
the
court
there
stated
quite
clearly
that
with
respect
to
age
discrimination,
there's
no
disparate
treatment
if
the
reason
is
a
factor
other
than
age.
these
are
some
general
principles
i
think
it
important
to
revisit.
in
hazen,
we
also
discussed
the
fact
that
there
the
mere
fact
that
an
employer
maybe
violated
erisa
and/or,
i
think
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
may
have...
may
have
violated
in...
in
another
instance
in
an
hypothetical
title
vii
with
respect
to
race
was
not
evidence
or
an
indication
that
age
was
the
deciding
factor.
with
that,
i
think
we
have
to
go
forward
then
to
hicks
and
initially
remember
what
were
the
general
principles,
as
i
read
hicks,
to
stand
for.
number
one,
that
no
court
may
substitute
for
the
required
finding
of
the
particular
discrimination
in
issue
here,
age,
the
much
lesser
and
different
standard
of
simply
disbelief
of
the
employer's
reason.
the
court
time
and
time
again
in
hicks
stated
that
there
must
be
evidence
both
that
the
employer's
reason
was
untrue
and
that
age
or...
in
this
case
age
was
the
motivation.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
justice
breyer,
i
think
first
we
must
visit
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
made
a...
a
statement,
reeves
may
well
be
correct
on
this,
something
of
that
nature.
but
still,
there's
no
evidence
of...
of
age.
now,
what
was
the
fifth
circuit
talking
about
when
they...
when
they
made
that
statement?
about
two
or
three
sentences
before
that
statement
in
their
opinion,
the
fifth
circuit
said
reeves
alleges
there's
pretext
because,
number
one,
i
attempted
to
be
careful
in
my
record
keeping.
number
two,
well,
these
errors
were
made
by
my
boss,
russell
caldwell.
and
three,
sanderson
could
not
really
quantify
the
amount
of
money
that
may
have
been
lost
on
this.
i
submit
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
the
evidence
of
pretext
was,
and
i
think
consistent
with
rhodes
v.
guiberson,
the
eighth
circuit's
decision,
the
second
circuit
in
fisher
v.
vassar
college,
the
numerous
other
circuits,
the
eighth
circuit
decision
in
rothmeier
v.
individual
investors,
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
stating
and
complying
with
what
your
honors
said
in
hicks
when
you
stated
there
may
be
instances...
i
paraphrase,
of
course...
when
the
prima
facie
case,
when...
and
coupled
with
evidence
of
disbelief
of
the
employer's
reason,
especially
if
accompanied
by
mendacity,
may...
may
be
sufficient
without
more.
what
i
envision
hicks
is
saying
there
and
what
the...
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
in
rhodes,
the
eighth
circuit,
the
sixth...
not
the
sixth...
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
second
read
that
to
mean
is
it
depends
what
is
the
prima
facie
case.
we
know,
as
set
forth
by
your
honors
in
hicks,
and
as
the
second
circuit
fisher
case
had
a
good,
i
think,
discussion
in
a
footnote,
that
there
were
over
100
cases
at
quick
blush--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
justice
breyer,
the...
the
statement
by
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
there
may
be
pretext
for
disbelief
of
certain
things
that
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
that
reeves
contended.
if...
if...
i
beg
the
court
to...
to
bear
with
me
a
second.
i
think
if
you...
if
you
digest
that
with
hicks,
we
have
to
decide,
as
i
was
beginning
to
say
earlier
and
i
think
will...
will
answer
your
question...
the
prima
facie
case
is
a
procedural
device
which
enables
a
plaintiff
to
shift
the
burden
of
production
to
the
defendant.
if
the
prima
facie
case
comes
out
in
that
skeletal
form
only,
the
one
two
three
four
test
at
mcdonnell
douglas,
and
if
after
the
defendant
articulates
a
non
age
reason,
the
plaintiff
then
only...
only
introduces
evidence
where
that's
not
true.
mr.
sanderson
plumbing,
you
didn't
quantify
the
amount.
mr.
reeves
said
that
his
boss
made
those
errors
even
though
his
boss
was
terminated
too.
if
that's
all
that's
present,
i
submit
that
hicks
says
that
is
not
enough
because
that
does
not
show
any
evidence
of
age
discrimination.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
petitioner's
prima
facie
case
does
more,
reaches
out
and
gathers
more
than
the...
than
the
skeletal
one,
two,
three,
four
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
then
coupled
with
evidence
of
disbelief
of
the
employer's
reason,
there
may
be
a
jury
question.
here,
as
i
was
going
to
say
earlier,
point
three
delves
into
that.
what...
what
was
the...
the
petitioner's
prima
facie
case
first?
they
stated
mr.
reeves
was
over
40,
contention
that
he
was
doing
his
job
satisfactory.
at
this
stage
we
don't
worry
too
much
whether
that
was...
the
prima
facie
was
made
or
not
because
your
honors
have
held
in
aikens
at
this
point
it
doesn't
matter.
but
in
any...
and
he
was
terminated
and
that
he
was
replaced
by
a
younger
person.
now,
this
evidence
also
was
undisputed
that
these
younger
people
who
replaced
petitioner,
in
their
30's,
were
also
terminated
at
a
later
date.
also,
the
evidence
showed
that
mr.
caldwell,
who
was
also
terminated,
was
replaced
by
an
older
person.
so,
we
have
that
flimsy,
weak,
mechanical
procedural
prima
facie
case
only.
what
else
did...
did
the
petitioner
submit?
mr.
chestnut
made
two,
as
the
petitioner
says,
age
related
statements.
what
were
they?
one,
supposedly,
you
must
have
come
over
on
the
mayflower.
some...
more...
more
than
2
months
before
the
termination.
he
was
unable
to
quantify
it,
but
much
more
than
2
months.
the
second,
when
mr.
reeves
was
working
on
a
piece
of
machinery,
mr.
chestnut
supposedly
said,
because
he
couldn't
get
the
machine
going,
you're
too
damned
old
to
do
that
job.
now,
your
honors
have
held
and
the
circuit
courts...
every
circuit
has
held
that
if
a
remark,
number
one,
is
not
made
by
a
decision
maker...
and
i
submit
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
not,
and
let
me
point
out
why,
if
i
may,
justice
stevens.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
he...
he...
at
the
time
of
the
termination,
mr.
chestnut
was
married
to
the
president
of
the
company.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
at
the
time
of
the
termination,
he
was
director
of
manufacturing.
now,
the
evidence
is...
remember,
it's
uncontradicted.
even
though
mr.
reeves
says,
i
think
he
was
the
absolute
power,
that
testimony
of
mr.
reeves
has
to
do
with
the
fact,
as
director
of
manufacturing,
certainly
out
on
the
plant
floor,
this
man
was.
but
the
evidence--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
you're
exactly
right.
that
was
mr.
oswalt,
the
33-year-old
gentleman
who
made
the
same
errors,
less
errors
than
the
petitioner,
who
quit
before
he
could
be
discharged.
well,
let's
talk
about
what
he
said.
he
stated
that
mr.
reeves
sometimes
was
hollered
at
by
mr.
chestnut,
was
mistreated
by
him
in
that
manner.
he
also
said
on
the
same
pages
of
the
record,
pages
82
and
83
of
the
transcript,
that
additionally
he,
mr.
chestnut,
hollered
at
me
some
and
he
hollered
at
mr.
caldwell,
mr.
reeves'
manager,
and
that
he
was
very
rude
to
these
people.
and
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
on
the
plant
floor
because
of
mr.
chestnut.
i
mention
that
because,
quite
frankly,
that's
an
evidence
of
the
petitioner
opening
up
a
reason
other
than
age:
dislike
by
mr.
chestnut.
a
good
example...
a
good
case
for
that
is
the
eighth
circuit
case
in
rothmeier
v.
individual
investors
where
the
plaintiff--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--no.
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
but
just
in
the
rothmeier
case,
the
defendant
did
not
put
on
the
defense,
if
i
may,
that
this
man
was
terminated
because
he
was
going
to
report
the
company
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
rather
than
age.
and
there
they
held...
the
petitioner
there
demonstrated
a
clear
reason
other
than
age.
here,
the
testimony
of
mr.
oswalt
gives
a
very
sufficient
basis
for
the
allegation
that
he,
mr.
reeves,
was
mistreated.
he
may
have
been.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
justice
ginsburg,
with
all
deference,
i
think
that's
a
perfect
example
of
when
the
jury
could
not
because
what
evidence
did
they
have?
the
two
statements,
by
your
own
decisions
and
every
circuit,
was
totally
disconnected--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
as
well
as
every
circuit,
no,
you
could
not.
it's
a
stray
remark.
it
has
no
probative
value,
just
as
any
other
comment
about
someone
being
unkind
or
mistreating
someone
for
some
other
reason.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
and
that
effort
was
made
at
the
lower
court.
it
could
have
been.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--well,
it...
it...
justice
souter
first
and
then
justice
ginsburg.
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
bridge
the
gap
in...
in
either
the
prima
facie
case
or
the
disbelief
of
the
employer's
reason
because
it
simply
was
not
probative
under
the
substantive
law
that's
been
created
as
evidence
of
age
discrimination.
that...
that's
the
position
of
the
respondent
on
this.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
justice
souter,
i
am.
i'm
saying
that
those
two
statements,
when
digested
with
the
entire
evidence
that
the
court
is
required
to
review,
does
not
indicate
pretext
for
discrimination
because
the
statements
have
no
place
in
the
termination
decision
or
even
the
investigation
decision
of
the
audit.
remember
this,
your
honors.
mr.
reeves,
contrary
to
his
counsel's
argument
in
the
brief,
never
disputed
or
contested
the
accuracy
of
the
audit,
which
revealed
numerous
errors
on
his
part,
numerous
errors
on
mr.
caldwell's
part,
and
numerous
errors
on
mr.
oswalt.
he
didn't
contest
that.
instead,
he
went
off
on
things
like,
well,
they
never
could
figure
out
the
total
amount
of
it,
or
well,
i
think
mr.
chestnut
really
was
the
one
who...
who...
he's
the
power.
he
must
have
been
the
one
who
terminated
him.
but...
but
the
evidence
is
to
the
opposite.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
there
was...
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
the
fifth
circuit,
in
finding
that
reeves
may
well
be
right
on
three
points,
i...
i
repeat--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes,
justice
breyer,
you're
exactly
right.
that's
what
the
court
said,
but
right
before
that,
what
they
were
talking
about
as
pretextual
were
the
three
things
i've
mentioned
which,
together
with
the
weak,
skeletal
procedural
prima
facie
case
here,
does
not
show
pretext
for
discrimination.
let...
let
me
add
that
even
if
we...
as
i
wanted
to
say
earlier,
even
if
we
jump
to
the...
to
the
petitioner's
conclusion,
which
is
not
supported
by
the
solicitor
general,
in
their
brief
that
each
and
every
instance
of
mere
disbelief
of
the
employer's
reason
is
sufficient,
i
cited
in
our
brief
the
sixth
circuit
decision
of
manzer
v.
diamond
and...
and
showed
that
some
of
the
other
circuits
that
i
think
erroneously
have
followed
hicks
have
stated
that,
well,
even
then
if
we're
going
to
show
pretext
to
show
that
if
the
reasons
are
not
true...
true...
three
things
have
to
be
proven.
number
one,
that
the
reason
advanced
is
baseless,
didn't
exist.
well,
there's
no
doubt
here.
there's
no
evidence.
there's
not
even
surmise
here,
and
mr.
reeves
had
a
lot
of
surmise.
there's
no
surmise
here
that
the
audit
was
not
correct.
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
fabricated.
it
led
to
the
discharge
of
two
and
would
have
led
to
the
discharge
of
three
had
he
been
here.
number
two,
were
the
reasons
sufficient
to
motivate
the
discharge?
well,
obviously
they
were.
they
led
to
the
discharge
of
mr.
caldwell
and
would
have
led
to
the
discharge
of
mr....
of
mr.
oswalt.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
points
you've
mentioned
were
repudiated
by
uncontradicted
testimony.
mr.
reeves
made
a
general
statement.
i
tried
to
be
careful.
sometimes
the
time
clocks
didn't
work.
i'm
going
into
specifics
here.
but
the
evidence--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--mr.
reeves
went
to
the
hospital
later
in
that
day,
but
he
was
present
when...
when
the
attendance
records
were
made
by
the
supervisor,
mr.
reeves,
that
day
on
her.
secondly--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--yes.
that
was
the
testimony.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
no.
mr.
reeves
testified
that
he
was
there
the
first
day
that
she
went
to
the
hospital
and
that
he
also
came
back
before
the
week
was
over...
mr.
reeves.
and
it
was
his
duty,
if
you
will
recall,
to
review
the
weekly
records
and
make
sure
there
was
no
error.
he
did
and
he
still
listed
her--
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
no,
i...
i
do
not
think
so.
in
fact,
mr.
caldwell
is
the
one
who
caught
it
on
the
monthly
report
and
corrected
it
and
after
mr.
reeves
had
reviewed
the
weekly
reports.
there...
there
are
many
things
that
mr.
reeves
has
stated,
based
on
his
surmise
and
suspicion,
but
it's...
it's...
in
all
deference,
your
honors,
it's
not
evidence.
it's...
it's
his
dislike
of
the
reasons.
i
don't
think
i
should
have
been
terminated,
or
maybe
sanderson
made
a
mistake.
well,
we
know
that
a
mistake
does
not
equate
under
decisions
from
every
circuit
to
age
discrimination.
so,
i
submit,
as
i
was
finishing,
in
the
one
two
three
standard
in
manzer,
the
pretext...
i
use
the
word
pretext
on
it,
and
it's
not
a
good
term
to
use...
circuit...
that
under
that
standard,
if
we
adopt
that
standard
that
the
petitioner
wants
us
to
use
today,
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
jury
question.
there
were
two
other
people
who
were
either
terminated
or
would
be
terminated.
there
were
two
other
people...
think
about
this...
independent
of
mr.
chestnut
who
independently
reviewed
these
records
and
made
the
recommendations
to
the...
to
the
president
that
mr.
reeves
be
terminated.
there
is
no
inference,
no
suspicion
that
these
two
were
in
any
way
connected
with
these
two
statements.
so,
i
guess
i
get
back,
your
honors,
to
the
very
beginning
of
my
argument
when
i
stated
that
when
you
boil
all
of
the
evidence
together...
that's
not
a
good
way
to
say
it,
but
i
think
that's
one
way
to
study
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence...
that
under
the
standard
i
think
is
correct,
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
taylor
b.
smith
thank
you--
