justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
agree
with
her.
but
you
agree
with
justice
ginsburg's
statement
of
it
if
she
had
said
reasonable
inference.
you
can't
draw
an
unreasonable
inference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
with
that
modification,
then
we
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
doesn't
hicks
also
say...
and
indeed,
doesn't
the
fifth
circuit
say
in
other
cases...
that
ordinarily
what
you
have
is
the
prima
facie
case?
and
in
addition,
you
know
one
other
thing.
the
lawyer
wasn't
telling...
the
employer
wasn't
telling
the
truth
when
he
gave
his
reason.
now,
what
i
thought
hicks
said
and
what
i
thought
that
reeves
said
is,
well,
in
the
fifth...
rhodes
i
guess...
in
the
fifth
circuit,
is
in...
in
most
cases,
that's
the
end
of
it.
of
course,
the
jury
could...
could
infer
from
those
two
things
that
there
was
discrimination.
now,
we
concede
there's
a
weird
case,
really
weird.
it
was
a
pretext.
but
it
was
a
pretext
because
the
employer
was
an
embezzler
and
he
had
been
found
out
by
the
employee.
and
i
grant
you
in
such
a
case
it
is
a
pretext,
but
not
for
discrimination.
so,
that's
why
there's
always
this
qualification.
but
you
have
a
case
where
the
fifth
circuit
said,
one,
there's
a
prima
facie
case;
two,
the
jury
could...
may
well
have
found
a
pretext;
but
three,
it
couldn't
come
to
the
conclusion
of
discrimination,
at
which
point
one
wants
to
shout
why?
why
not?
i
mean,
after
all,
your
employer
client
was
not
an
embezzler.
there's
no
evidence
here
that
it's
a
weird
case.
so...
so,
therefore,
i
thought
perhaps
this
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
though
not
rhodes,
is
inconsistent
with
hicks,
with
rhodes,
and
with
a
lot
of
other
things.
and
that's
what
the
sg
says.
so,
i'm
very
interested
in
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
could...
if
i
could
bring
you
back
just
one
second
for
my...
the
precise--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--response
i
was
looking
for.
and
if...
if
the
fifth...
if
in
your...
the
opinion
in
your
case,
the
fifth
circuit
had
only
said
what
you
started
out
by
saying,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
i
mean,
if
they
had
said
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
of
pretext.
but
that
isn't
what
they
said.
what
they
said
is
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
found
that
sanderson's
explanation
for
its
employment
decision
was
pretextual.
reeves
on
this
point
very
well
may
be
right.
so,
what
i
want
to
know
is
how...
if
they
found
it
was
pretextual
and
you
had
the
prima
facie
case,
how
conceivably
could
there
not
have
been
discrimination,
let
alone
a
jury
question?
i
mean,
as
i
said,
your
employer
was
not
a
suddenly
discovered
embezzler.
there
is
no
evidence
it
was
a
pretext
for
something
else.
so,
how
could
it
have
both
been
a
pretext
and
yet
in
your
case...
i'm
not
thinking
of
a
statement
of
law.
i
want
to
know
in
your
case
how
could
it
have
both
been
a
pretext
and
he
wasn't
fired
for
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you're
right,
then
there
was
no
pretext.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it
wasn't
a
pretext.
if
you
are
right
about
this,
it
wasn't
a
pretext.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
of
course,
the...
the
fifth
circuit
said
the
opposite.
so,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
say
that.
it
said...
it
said
that
they
could
have
found...
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
found
that
sanderson's
explanation
was
pretextual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
it
said...
that's
what's
claimed,
and
it
said
reeves
may
very
well
be
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
it
has
to
be
a
pretext
for
age
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can't
be
a
pretext
for
hiding
embezzlement
or
something.
