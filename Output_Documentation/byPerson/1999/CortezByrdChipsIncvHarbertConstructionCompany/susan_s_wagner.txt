ms.
susan
s.
wagner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
certainly
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
the
interpretation
of
the
venue
provisions
under
sections
10
and
11
of
the
faa,
but
those
sections
cannot
be
read
in
isolation
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
this
venue
is
exclusive
or
not
exclusive.
the
best
way
to
tell
what
congress
or
what
the
drafters
of
the
faa
had
in
mind
when
it
put
this
statute
together
is
to
compare
sections
9,
10,
and
11
with
other
provisions
of
the
faa
and
to
see
how
they
compare
and
contrast,
and
also
to
compare
sections
9
with
the
different
language
of
sections
10
and
11.
looking
at
sections
9,
10,
and
11
alone
and
particularly
10
and
11
alone--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
particularly
to
section
4
of
the
faa.
we
have
cited
the
1925
version
of
that
section
in...
on
page
12
of
our
red
brief.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
and
then
the...
i'm
sorry,
the
modern
version
is
on
page
12
of
the
red
brief.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
i'm
sorry?
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
in
page
11
of
the...
i'm
sorry,
page
11
of
our
brief
cites
the
language
of
the
original
1925
version,
i
believe,
and
what
that
says
is
that
a
party
who
seeks
to
compel
arbitration,
in
other
words,
a
pre-arbitration
type
of
proceeding,
such
a
party
may
petition
any
court
of
the
united
states,
which
save
for
the
arbitration
agreement...
i'm
paraphrasing...
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
judicial
code,
which
is
now
title
28,
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
arising
out
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties.
the
modern
version
of
section
4
is
basically
to
the
same
effect.
it
substitutes
courts
of
the
united
states
with
district
courts,
but
essentially
it
is
to
the
same
effect.
that
section,
in
sharp
contrast
with
sections
9,
10,
and
11,
provides
broad
venue,
or
it
does
one
of
two
things.
it
either
provides
extremely
broad
venue
concurrent
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
as
the
petitioner
argues,
or
it
expressly
incorporates
the
venue
provisions
of
section
1391
of
title
28.
now,
if,
as
we
say,
it
expressly
incorporates
venue,
then
by
doing
that
in
section
4
and
rejecting
that
language
in
favor
of
much
more
restrictive
language
in
sections
9,
10,
and
11,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
incorporate
those
general--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--justice
breyer,
you
asked
certainly
a
compound
question,
and
i'll
try
to
answer
it
in
turn.
first,
why
would
they
want
to
do
that?
we're
talking
about
venue
of
an
action
that
challenges
an
arbitration
award,
much
like
you
would
have
an
appellate
review,
and
you
may
have
a
case
where
the
parties
are
litigating
in
alabama,
and
for
circumstances
that
have
changed,
perhaps
they
really
don't
think
alabama
is
the
best
forum,
but
there
it
is.
they
can't
go
appeal
in
california
because
they
think
that's
a
more
convenient
forum
for
their
appeal.
so
why
would
congress
want
to
provide
for
that
review
process
to
be
in
the
same
forum?
it
is
analogous
to
an
appeal,
and
that
gives
the
district
court
some
power
over
the
arbitration
and
over
the
proceedings
because
they're
in
the
same
location.
in
fact,
justice--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--because
section
9,
your
honor,
is
not
really
analogous
to
appeal.
section
9
is
not
a
review
process.
it's
simply
a
process
of
certifying
and
reducing
to
judgment--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--yes,
it
would,
and
in
that
instance
certainly
you
would
end
up
with,
if
you
were
in
two
different...
if
the
parties
agreed
to
a
forum
for
confirmation
that
was
different
from
the
location
of
the
arbitration
award
you
would
have
the
proceeding
then
going
forward
in
another
location,
and
that
would
occur
in
that
instance,
so
it
would
still--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--that's
right,
and
of
course--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--my
question,
justice
stevens,
was...
or
my
answer
was
directed
to
the
question,
why
would
they
want
to
do
this,
and
i
think
that
provides
us
an
answer,
and
again,
it's
just
guesswork
as
to
why--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--the
answer
to
that
question
relates
to
the
fact,
justice
breyer,
that
this
is
a
venue
provision.
it
is
not
a
subject
matter
provision.
and
as
you
have
pointed
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
venue
is
waivable.
venue
is
always
waivable,
and
there's
nothing
about
this
particular
statutory
scheme
that
would
keep
venue
from
being
waivable,
so
we
have
a
situation
where,
if
everybody
agrees
that
alabama
or
mississippi
or
hawaii
is
a
better
forum,
and
they
continue
to
agree
to
that
after
the
arbitration
is
over,
then
a
court
could
be
empowered
through
that--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--they
certainly
can
do
that.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
i
don't
know--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--i
don't
know
that
it's
normal,
justice
breyer,
for
the
parties
ever
to
agree
on
what
is
the
best
venue,
which
is
part
of
the
problem
here,
is
that
the
idea
that
the
parties
after
the
arbitration
is
over
are
going
to
get
together
and
say,
hey,
let's
agree,
i
mean,
if
they
do
that--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--the
agreement
can
provide
a
forum
selection
clause,
but
the
parties
could
alternatively
agree
after
the
arbitration
is
over
as
to
an
appropriate
forum,
and
again,
precisely
as
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out,
the
court
can
say,
well,
do
i
have
venue,
and
the
parties
can
say,
well,
judge,
we'd
rather
be
here.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
i
would
agree
that
if
venue
is
properly
conferred
by
waiver,
or
in
the
case
of
section
9
by
a
forum
selection
clause,
that
the
court
would
have
the
power,
then,
to
do
whatever
later
comes
up
in
that
case.
once
a
case
is
filed
in
an
appropriate
venue,
in
an
appropriate
forum,
that
court
could
carry
forward
with
the
rest
of
the
case.
whether
it's
a
section
10
or
11
proceeding,
or
a
section
9
proceeding,
that
court
could
keep
that
case.
so
although
section
11,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
seems
to
envision
proceedings
by
the
same
court,
or
in
the
same
geographical
location
as
the
arbitration,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
always
be
the
case
because
of
these
principles
of
waiver
and
because
of
the
principle
of
retention
of
jurisdiction
once
the
court
has
the
case.
similarly--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--the...
section
11
empowers
a
court
to
modify
an
award,
but
the
provision
as
to
which
court
may
modify
the
award
is
one
of
venue,
so
it's
really
a
compound
provision
in
the
sense
that
it
grants
power
to
the
district
court
but
specifies
a
venue
for
exercise
of
that
power.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
i--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--that...
i
do
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
yes.
i'd
like
to,
though,
just
make
one
point,
particularly
about
section
4,
that
i
was
discussing
previously,
and
that
is
that
we
have
said
that
section
4
expressly,
expressly
incorporates
the
venue
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.
1391,
and
the
point
i'd
like
to
make,
since
it
was
addressed
in
the
reply
brief
and
we
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
respond,
is
that...
is
the
question
of
whether
section
4
is
really
referring
to
venue
or
whether
it's
referring
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
i
would
just
point
out
that
congress
oftentimes,
and
certainly
in
the
early
part
of
this
century,
has
used
the
word
venue
when
it
really
means...
has
used
the
word
jurisdiction
when
it
really
means
venue,
or
has
used
the
word
venue...
has
used
the
word
jurisdiction
broadly
to
include
concepts
of
venue
as
well
as
subject
matter
and
personal
jurisdiction,
so
by
its
reference
in
section
4
to
venue
being
concurrent
with
jurisdiction
under
title
28,
we
say
that
that
means
that
venue
under
section
4
incorporates
the
venue
provisions
of
title
28
as
well
as
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
justice
stevens,
certainly
congress
could
have
done
that,
but
they
didn't
choose
to
do
that.
the
language
of
section
9,
10,
and
11--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--well,
the
language--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--we
say
that
section
4
has
to
be
compared
and
contrasted,
that
the
language
of
section
4
has
to
be
read
alongside
with
9,
10,
and
11
to
see
that
they
provide
different
venue.
section
4
says,
venue
is,
you
simply
refer
to
the
general
venue
statutes
under
title
28.
section
9
says,
for
these
proceedings
you
have
just
this
single
specified
court,
10
and
11
to
the
same
effect.
there's
nothing
in
9,
10,
or
11
that
suggests
that
venue
applies
under
any
other
section
of
the
act.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
let
me
draw
another
analogy,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that
question,
and
that
is
a
simple
case
of
two
corporations
having
a
dispute
arbitrate
their
dispute
in
alabama.
let's
say
they're
both
incorporated
here...
here.
i'm
from
alabama.
but
they're
both
incorporated
in
alabama.
they
both
have
their
principle
place
of
business
in
alabama.
their
dispute
arises
in
alabama.
their
arbitration
takes
place,
either
by
agreement
or
by
decision
of
the
arbitrators
takes
place
in
birmingham,
alabama.
one
of
the
parties
is
then
dissatisfied
with
the
award
and
chooses
to
challenge
it
under
sections
10
and
11.
that
party
then
could
file
the
proceeding
in
alaska
to
challenge
that
alabama
arbitration
proceeding
if
the
defendant
had
a
place
of
business
there,
or
if
the
defendant
did
business
there
and
satisfied
the
requirements
of--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--of
course,
under
modern
venue
statutes
the...
a
corporate
defendant
could
have
multiple
residence,
which
is
the
hypothetical
that
i
presented,
but
even
under
old
law--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--under
the
old
law
there
might
have
been
just
one
residence,
because
the
residence
definitions
have
come
since
that
time,
since
the
original
faa--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--yes,
your
honor.
the
modern
version
of
1391
is
in...
is
on
page
1
of
the
blue
brief.
but
getting
back
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
why
would
the...
why
would
congress
choose
the
default
to
be
where
the
arbitration
occurs
when
the
defendant's...
when
the
defendant's
residence
may
be
elsewhere?
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
has
been
a
determination
of
an
appropriate
forum
as
part
of
the
arbitration
proceedings
either
by
the
agreement
or
by
the
arbitrator
that
is
presumptively
convenient,
and
very
simply,
the
faa
wanted
to
streamline...
the
congress
wanted
to
streamline
arbitration
proceedings
by
providing
that
not
every
decision
that
an
arbitrator
makes
should
be
subject
to
second-guessing.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
first,
the
arbitrator
or
the
arbitration
association
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
selecting
a
convenient
forum,
and
again,
congress,
your
honor,
was
trying
to
take
those
kinds
of
mundane
considerations
away
from
a
position
where
they
would
be
second-guessed
by
later
court
proceedings.
the
arbitrator's
discretion
in
many,
many
matters
is
not
subject
to
being
second-guessed
and
revisited
in
court
proceedings.
the
review
is
very,
very
narrow.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
but
the
decision
that
the
arbitration
is
the
most
convenient
forum
for
the
parties
can
carry
forward
with
respect
to
later
review,
and
second,
to
answer
your
question,
certainly
the
defendant's
residence
may
not
be
the
best
forum
for
review
for
a
number
of
reasons.
since
we're
talking
about
proceedings
under
section
10
and
11,
which
is
review
and
which
is
a
challenge
to
the
award,
it
provides
that,
for
example,
for
fraud,
or
for
some
kind
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
parties
and
the
arbitrator,
that
that
award
could
be
set
aside.
the
convenience
not
only
to
the
defendant,
or
to
the
party
who
is
trying
to
uphold
the
award,
but
also
to
witnesses,
to
the
arbitrator
him
or
herself,
all
of
those
considerations
of
convenience
of
everyone
involved
come
into
play
in
making
a
decision
as
to
where
the
arbitration
should
occur,
and
again,
that
can
carry
forward.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
justice
scalia,
the
presumption
has
not
been
stated
in
those
general
terms.
the
presumption
that
this
court
applies
is
that
if
a
specific
venue
statute
is
not
intended
to
be
exclusive,
that
it
can
be
supplemented
by
later
changes
in
general
venue
statutes.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
but
that
is
what
the
cases
say,
and
there
is--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--i
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
scalia.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
there
is
a
countervailing
presumption
that
specific
controls
over
general,
that
if
congress
specified
venue
or
had
a
specific
venue
provision
for
a
particular
act,
particularly
one
that's
incorporated
as
part
of
an
overall
legislative
scheme--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--that's
correct.
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
it
is...
your
honor,
it
is
venue,
certainly,
and
certainly,
although
this
provides
for
exclusive
forum,
it
is
simply
venue
and
can
be
waived,
but
the
statute,
by
default,
in
the
absence
of
such
a
post
arbitration
agreement
with
respect
to
9
or
10,
the
default
is
whatever
the
arbitrator
has
decided
or
the
parties
have
decided
is
the
appropriate
forum
for
the
arbitration
proceedings.
and--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--well--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--and--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--which
they
can
do,
because--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--well,
they
can
do,
once
that
proceeding,
justice
breyer,
is
filed
under
section
3...
under
section
4
to
compel
arbitration,
or
under
section
3
to
stay
a
pending
lawsuit.
that
court
has
the
case,
and
if
that
court
retains
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
then
that
court
can
handle
later
proceedings,
because
these
are,
again,
simply
venue
provisions.
but
getting
back
to,
i
guess,
an
earlier
question
i'd
like
to
complete
the
answer
to,
and
that
is,
why
can't
we
just
assume
that
the
general
venue
statutes...
why
can't
we
just
apply
this
liberally.
well,
first
of
all,
venue
is
not
something
that
you
simply
apply
liberally
out
of
some
overriding
policy
consideration.
you
have
to
look
at
what
is
intended,
and
you
have
to
apply
it
as
it
was
written,
and
second,
the
section
10
and
11,
particularly
in
contrast
with
section
4,
simply
cannot
be
read
to
leave
that
door
wide
open.
and
i
also
would
point
out,
as
we
have
in
our
briefs,
that
looking
at
the
history
of
this
section,
looking
at
the
broad
venue
provision
that
congress
rejected
out
of
the
new
york
statute
in
favor
of
the
very
limited
provisions,
it's
clear
that
they
wanted
to
have
this
to
be
a
limited
venue
provision.
i'd
like...
i'd
also
raise
one
other
practical
consideration,
and
that
is,
a
number
of
arbitrations
in
modern
day
are
consolidated,
where
there
may
be
multiple
claims,
multiple

in
light
of
the
comparison
between
section
4
and
section
9,
10,
and
11,
also
the
contrast
between
9,
10,
and
11,
there
really
is
only
one
reading
that
can
be
had
of
this
statute,
that
the
intent
of
the
congress
is
clear,
and
that
the
default
provision
for
venue,
the
provision
that
will
apply
in
the
cases
where
there
is
not
already
a
pending
case,
or
whether
there's
not
post
arbitration
agreement,
is
going
to
be
where
the
arbitration
award
took
place,
where
the
hearing
took
place.
congress
has
determined
that
that
is
presumptively
a
proper
forum,
and
that
it
simply
should
not
be
subject
to
later
litigation
as
to
whether
there
might
be
some,
you
know,
arguably
better
forum
for
that
proceeding.
treating
it
like,
as
though
it's
an
appeal
process,
it's
a
review
process,
where,
for
example,
the
arbitrator
might
be
subject
to
discovery,
witnesses
might
have
to
be
called
with
respect
to
allegations
of
fraud
and
the
like--
ms.
susan
s.
wagner
--that's
right,
but
again,
presumptively
like
an
appeal.
answering
the
question
why
this
congress
would
do
it,
it
seems
that
that's
the
way
they
viewed
it,
that
they
viewed
this
as
something
which
naturally
ought
to
flow
upstream
through
the
same
location,
but
certainly
there
are
circumstances
where
that
would
not
necessarily
follow,
and
that
would
be
cases
where
there
is
jurisdiction
that
has
been
lodged
in
a
particular
court,
or
where
the
parties
simply
waive
venue
objections.
but
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
looking
at
a
comparison
of
this
statute
with
the
broader
language
of
the
new
york
statute
that
served
as
its
model,
and
that
congress
rejected
in
favor
of
this
very
closely
delineated
provision
for
venue,
it's
very
clear
what
congress
had
in
mind
and,
as
this
court
has
held,
has
often
held,
venue
is
not
something
that
this
court
can
simply
apply
in
a
way
that
seems
convenient,
or
any
court,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
statute.
