unknown
speaker
mr.
bromberg,
do
you
think
that
the
word
may
in
section
9,
10,
and
11
must
be
interpreted
the
same
way?
does
section
9
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
that
10
and
11
mean,
in
effect,
in
the
use
of
the
word
may?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
permissive
only
because
it's
conditional.
i
mean,
it
reads,
if
no
court
is
specified
in
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
then
such
application
may
be
made
to
the
united
states
court
in
and
for
the
district
in
which
such
award
was
made.
now,
you
really
wanted
them
to
say,
then
such
application
must
be
made?
i
mean,
the
writer
could
think
that
that
would
be
a
command
to
make
an
application.
surely
you
don't
have
to
make
an
application,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't
that
explain
the
may?
it's
a
conditional
may.
if
no
court
is
specified,
then
such
application
may
be
made.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
you
are.
there
goes
your
may
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
one
case
that
doesn't
do
that?
isn't
it...
it's
the
radzanower
case.
the
words
were,
may
be
had.
this
was
in
reference
to
venue
for
suits
against
national
banks,
and
the
court
treated
that
as
an
exclusive
venue
provision
even
though
the
words
were
may
be
had.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
curiosity
about
the
procedural
history
of
this
case,
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
address
it,
and
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
circuit,
the
eleventh
circuit
was
relying
on
old
fifth
circuit
precedent,
which
was
since
changed
in
the
fifth
circuit,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
panel
was
stuck,
yet
you
didn't
ask
for
an
en
banc
so
the
new
eleventh
could
consider
the
question
afresh
in
light
of
what
the
current
fifth
circuit
has
held.
unknown
speaker
even
though
most
of
the
circuits
go
your
way.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me,
is
it
always
crystal
clear
which
district
the
award
has
been
made
in?
if
the
arbitrators
meet
in
several
different
cities,
and
their
offices
are
in
different
parts,
is
it
always
clear
where
the
award
was
made?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
true,
does
that
help
or
hurt
you
in
your
interpretation
of
the
statute?
on
the
one
hand
it
means
that
there's
perhaps
multiple...
it
seems
to
me
it
would
help
you.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
it
was
not
the
parties
but
was
the
american
arbitration
association
that
specified
a
place
for
the
arbitration,
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
the
parties
did
stipulate
for
the
application
of
mississippi
law,
and
yet,
although
they
might
have,
they
didn't
provide
for
a
forum
for
the
enforcement
of
the
award.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
applications
to
vacate
would...
no.
you
must
have
misspoke.
unknown
speaker
applications
to
confirm
would
be
under
9.
unknown
speaker
applications
to
confirm
would
be
under
9.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
aren't
the
parties
going
to
often
be
disputing
which
is
the
venue
that
they
want,
one
wants
one
and
one
wants
the
other?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
race
to
the
courthouse
problem?
if
you
have
multiple
venues,
then
you
could
have
what
happened
here,
one
files
in
mississippi,
the
other
files
in
alabama,
where
if
you
say
the
only
place
you
can
go,
barring
your
agreement
on
some
other
place,
is
the
place
where
the
arbitration
occurs,
and
you
don't
have
the
race
to
the
courthouse
problem.
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
argument
to
be
made
as
with
respect
to
convenience
that
if
there
really
is
a
mutually
convenient
venue
the
parties
will
have
selected
it
and,
if
they
have
selected
it,
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
that,
having
selected
it
once,
that
should
be
the
venue
for
all
times
whenever
any
issue
on
the
merits
is
being
litigated,
whether
it
litigated
before
the
arbitrator,
or
litigated
later
on
on
a
motion
to
vacate
or
to
modify.
is
that...
would
that
be
a
sound
argument?
unknown
speaker
because,
what,
they
want
the
arbitrator
who
lives
there,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
may
not
trust
the
courts
of
that
jurisdiction,
although
they're
willing
to
trust
an
arbitrator
who's
selected
by
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
now,
it
would
not
be
the
consequence
of
your
interpretation,
would
it,
that
if
the
parties
agree
in
their
arbitration
agreement
as
to
where
litigation
concerning
the
arbitration
award
will
be
conducted,
that
will
govern?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be.
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
of
course.
that
was
mainly
what
i
had
in
mind.
section
10--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
you
had
an
agreement,
would
allow
an
order
to
vacate
to
be
brought
in
the
district
where
the
award
was
made,
whether
or
not
the
parties
agreed
to
another
district,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
can
a
defendant
waive
proper
venue?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
generally
speaking.
i
mean,
i
sue
you
in
a
place
where
venue
statutes
do
not
allow
me
to
sue
you,
and
you
simply
make
no
defense.
you're
willing
to
have
it
there.
unknown
speaker
it's
generally
the
case
that
venue...
venue
is
a
highly
waivable
thing
in
the
pecking
order.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
not
waivable.
personal
jurisdiction
is,
but
it's
not
easily
waived.
venue
is
highly
waivable.
that's
the
way
it
works
generally,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
interpretation
congress
also,
you
admit
that
10
is
exclusive,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
they
make...
the...
no,
i
guess
not.
you
would
say
that
even
a
request
to
vacate
may
be
brought
under
the
general
venue
statute
as
well.
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
suit
that
you
brought,
is
a
suit
to
vacate.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
what
happens
to
the
authorities
conferred
upon
the
court
by
section
11
if
the
suit
is
not
brought
in
the
court
specified
by
section
11?
section
11
gives
the
district
courts
powers
that
i
am
not
sure
district
courts
somewhere
else
would
have,
namely,
where
there
was
an
evident
material
miscalculation
of
figures,
or
an
evident
material
mistake,
the
court
can
modify
or
correct
the
award
where
the
arbitrators
have
awarded
upon
a
matter
not
submitted
to
them,
or
where
the
award
is
imperfect
in
matter
of
form,
not
affecting
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
you
think
any
united
states
court
would
have
that
authority
anyway?
unknown
speaker
then
why
did
they
say
it?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
say
it,
then?
unknown
speaker
even
a
court
under
1331?
wow.
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says
the
united
states
court
in
and
for
the
district
wherein
the
award
was
made
may
make
such
an
order,
and
you're
saying
we
should
read
that
to
say,
moreover,
any
other
u.s.
court
can
make
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i'm
sure
it
does
refer
back
to
section
9,
but
section
9
only
applies
to
a
certain
court,
a
court
in
the
district
where
the
award
was
made.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
say
section
9
is
not
exclusive,
and
you
can
certainly
bring
the
suit
in
another
court.
that's
fine.
but
section
9,
even
if
you
refer
back
to
it,
only
refers
to
the
court
where
the
award
was
made.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
problems
with
your
interpretation.
i
don't
know
what
you
do
with
the
substantive
provisions
of
section
11
if
you
sort
of
extend
them
to
all
other
courts.
it
seems
very
strange
to
extend
them
to
all
other
courts.
now,
maybe...
maybe
they
don't
say
anything.
maybe
any
court
would
have
that
authority
anyway.
i
guess
that's
probably
your
best
argument.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
my
scenario
that
would
do
that.
it's
yours.
you're
the
one
that
would
allow
suit
in
various
courts.
if
suit
could
only
be
brought
in
this
court,
you'd
have
those
powers.
unknown
speaker
it
always
could
be
brought
in
the
place
where
your
parties
agreed
on.
unknown
speaker
it
always
could
be
brought
where
the
parties
agreed
to
have
it
brought,
which
might
be
different
from
this
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
we
can
decide
that
issue
in
a
later
case,
and
be
treated
to
this
whole
thing
again,
right?
unknown
speaker
you
talk
about
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
state
courts,
mr.
bromberg.
does
the
federal
arbitration
act
in...
by
terms
give
the
state
courts
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
yes,
certainly
substantive
provisions
in
southland
were
held
to
apply,
but
what
about
provisions
to
vacate
awards
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
was
subject
to
the
federal
arbitration
act?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bromberg.
ms.
wagner,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
where
will
we
find
these?
is
it
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
or--
unknown
speaker
--page
what?
unknown
speaker
you
say...
is
it
set
out
in
haec
verba
there?
unknown
speaker
are
the
words
to
section
4
set
out
at
page
12?
unknown
speaker
why
would
congress
want
to
have
done
such
a
thing?
i
mean,
a
normal
case,
a
sues
b,
they're
both
residents
of
the
middle
west,
different
states,
they're
in
federal
court
in
iowa,
you
know,
and
the
judge
there
says,
go
to
arbitration.
i'll
suspend
this
suit.
go
arbitrate.
you
promised
to
arbitrate.
and
now
you're
saying,
when
they
finish
their
arbitration,
which
happens
to
be
at
the
association's
headquarters
in
new
york,
they
cannot
come
back
to
where
they
started
their
original
suit
in
the
middle
of
the
argument
and
get
this
either
enforced.
worse
than
that,
if
they
happen
to
agree
in
their
agreement,
by
the
way,
we're
always
going
to
be
able
to
sue
each
other
in
iowa,
always,
even
though
they
agreed
to
that,
on
your
interpretation,
too
bad,
although
you
could
go
to
iowa
to
have
the
thing
confirmed,
you
have
to
stay
in
new
york
to
have
it
vacated,
modified,
et
cetera.
i
mean,
i
do
not
know
why
any
human
being
would
want
such
a
thing,
and
so
i
cannot
think
of
what
congress
could
have
had
in
mind
by
buying
your
interpretation,
but
i
can
easily
think
what
they
would
have
had
in
mind
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
analogous
to
an
appeal,
then
why
did
congress
provide
in
section
9
that
it
could
be
any
place
the
parties
pick?
unknown
speaker
but
in
a
section
9
proceeding,
wouldn't
a
motion
to
vacate
modify
the
compulsory
counterclaim?
it
would
have
to
be
brought.
unknown
speaker
i
must
say,
i'm
troubled
by
your
analogy
to
appellate
review.
in
a
normal
litigation,
of
course
an
appellate
court
in
alabama
can
only
review
trial
courts
in
alabama,
but
that
doesn't
at
all
apply
to,
you
might
pick
an
arbitrator
in
hawaii
just
to...
you
want
him
out
there,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
want
to
litigate
in
hawaii.
unknown
speaker
or
that
any...
it
would
only
be
hawaii
courts
that
would
have
any
particular
ability
to
review
the
matter,
either,
so
i
don't
find
your
analogy
very
persuasive.
unknown
speaker
would
they
have
wanted
this
situation
where
the
parties
say,
we
absolutely
agree,
absolutely
agree
that
when
it
comes
time
to
confirm
this
award
it
will
be
here,
at
our
home
in
hawaii,
and
they
write
it
right
in,
we
love
hawaii.
[laughter]
and
now
it
turns
out,
because
the
arbitration
takes
place
in
new
york...
they're
willing
to
go
there
once
in
their
lives,
all
right.
that
when
it
comes
time
to
confirm
the
award,
right
back
to
hawaii.
but
should
anybody
have
a
complaint
about
it,
want
to
modify
a
comma,
vacate
it,
or
whatever,
they
have
to
stay
in
new
york.
now,
i
mean,
why
would
somebody
really
want
to
do
that,
to
take
one
example?
unknown
speaker
does
that...
i
don't
know
how
that
works.
does
that
normally
happen
where,
say
i'm
a
rather
alert
judge,
which
may
be
contrary
to
fact,
but
i'm
sitting
there
with
a
case
in
front
of
me,
and
i
happen
to
know
i'm
in
alaska,
and
i
also
happen
to
know
there's
no
venue
in
alaska,
and
suppose
i
were
to
say
to
one
of
the
parties,
i'm
surprised
here
you
happen
to
be
in
alaska,
because
the
statute
here
says
there's
no
venue.
now,
does
that
normally
happen,
and
they
say,
oh,
don't
worry
about
it.
unknown
speaker
does
that...
is
that
normal?
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
forum
selection
clause
would
come
before
that.
it
would
come
in
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
wouldn't
it,
just
as
there
was
here
a
choice
of
law
clause
but
not
a
choice
of
forum
clause.
it
wouldn't
occur
after
the
arbitration.
you
would
expect
it
to
be
in
the
agreement
itself.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
wagner,
your
answer...
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
answer,
it
assumes
an
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
significance
in
section
11
of
apparently
empowering
that,
the
court
particularly
mentioned
in
section
11,
with
the
authority
to
modify
an
award,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
assumes
that
any
court
with
jurisdiction
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that
if
the
parties
otherwise
waive
the
venue,
any...
otherwise
waive
the
restrictive
venue
provision,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
source
of
the
power
of
a
federal
court
to
modify
awards
if
it
isn't
section
11?
unknown
speaker
so
in
this
respect
you're
in
agreement
with
your
colleague.
he
reads
the
statute
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
on
venue
you
disagree,
but
insofar
as
the
substantive
authority
of
the
court,
you
both
agree
that
the
statute
is,
shall
we
say,
severable?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
this
question
about
section
4?
that
covers
every...
that
applies
to
a
suit
to
compel
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
now,
obviously,
you
couldn't
authorize
venue
for
such
a
suit
in
the
place
where
arbitration
had
taken
place.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
could
read
this
broadly
and
then
say
you
have
the
additional
situation,
if
an
arbitration
is
out
in
hawaii
or
some
place
it
is
also
permissible
there,
and
it
would
all
fit
together,
it
seems
to
me.
in
other
words,
this
is
sort
of
the
background
rule
of
venue
any
place
within
this
group.
then
you
say,
but
now
when
there
is
an
arbitration
and
an
action
enforced,
that
couldn't
have
been
covered
in
4.
you
need
an
additional
venue
provision
to
cover
that
contingency.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
section
4
adds
any
enlightenment
on
the
issue.
the
question
is,
how
do
you
read
the
other
section?
do
you
read
it
with
the
background
principle
that
venue
of
course
is
available
in
all
these
places,
but
in
addition
you
can
have
venue
where
you
couldn't
have
had
it
for
a
suit
to
compel
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
already
said
it
isn't
a
single
court,
because
you
could
choose
to
have
the
award
confirmed
by
agreement,
and
then
the
modification
would
be
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
would
be
in
a
place
other
than
the
place
where
arbitration
was
held.
but
one
question
that
i
don't
think
your
presentation
responds
to
is,
the
default
venue,
the
place
where
a
person
could
always
be
sued
even
before
the
expansion
of
1391
is
where
defendant's
home
base
is,
where
defendant
resides.
now,
why
in
the
world
would
congress
want
to
cut
out
that
most
convenient
place
for
a
defendant
to
be
sued
and
say,
no,
you
can't
sue
a
defendant
at
the
place
that
would
be
most
convenient
for
defendant?
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
asking
about
every
place
where
the
defendant
does
business.
i
was
asking
the
defendant's
residence.
the
one
and
only
defendant's
residence.
that
would
be
alabama
in
your
hypothetical.
i'm
not
asking
you
why
congress
might
have
had
a
reason
for
wanting
to
cut
out
every
place
where
the
defendant
is
doing
business,
but
why
would
it
want
to
cut
out
the
one
place
where
the
defendant
resides,
which
on
your
theory
it
does?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
there's...
there's
still
a
distinction
between
residing,
which
would
be
place
of
incorporation,
principal
place
of
business,
and
other
places
where
the
defendant
is
doing
business.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
1391...
do
we
have
1391
some
place?
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
say
it
is
presumptively
convenient,
because
that
was
sort
of
the
point
that
an
earlier
question
of
mine
was
aiming
at,
and
i
thought
i
got
a
very
good
answer
to
it.
it
may
be
very
inconvenient,
but
there
may
be
a
good
arbitrator
there,
or
it
may
be
sufficiently
convenient
if
we're
talking
about
arbitration,
but
totally
unacceptable
if
we're
talking
about
a
willingness
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
so
i
guess...
i
guess
i'm
really
asking
you
two
questions.
why
do
you
think
it
is
presumptively
convenient,
and
number
2,
why
is
presumptive
convenience
the
only
consideration
in
trying
to
rationalize
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
place
of
the
arbitration
will
not
ne
second-guessed,
but
that's
not
the
question
we've
got.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wagner,
why
shouldn't
we
just
apply...
you
know,
we
have
expressed
a
presumption
in
some
of
our
cases
that
where
you
have
a
special
venue
provision
we
will
presume
it
to
be
supplementary
and
not
displacive
unless
it
is
made
clear
that
the
opposite
is
intended.
i
do
not
consider
it
at
all
clear
here
that
the
opposite
is
intended.
why
don't
we
just
apply
the
presumption
so
that
congress
will
know
in
the
future
when
you
adopt
a
special
venue
provision
we're
assuming
that
that
simply
is
cumulative.
it
is
added
to
the
normal
venue
provision.
why
isn't
this
an
absolutely
perfect
case
for
applying
that
presumption?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
we
said.
it's
utterly
meaningless.
if
it's
not
intended
to
be
exclusive,
it's
not
exclusive.
that's
a
very
significant
piece
of
judicial--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
not.
i
think
they
express
a
presumption
that
when
congress
enacts
a
venue
provision
it
supplements
extant
venue
provisions
unless
it
is
clear
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
haven't
said
it,
why
shouldn't
we
say
it?
unknown
speaker
but
ms.
wagner,
that's
hard
to
apply
here,
because
the
particular
could
be
any
place
under
the
choice
of
forum
clause--
unknown
speaker
--which
you
concede,
and
then
vacation
comes
in
as
a
compulsory
counterclaim,
so
it's
the
most
general.
it's
anything.
anything.
unknown
speaker
they
say,
if
in
doubt,
and
all
the
canons
are
pointing
in
different
directions,
and
the
language
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
i
guess
you
could
try
to
do
what
seems
to
make
the
most
sense.
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
particular
case
you've
said
it
does
make
sense
to
say
that
where
congress...
what
congress
intended
was,
well,
where
the
parties
don't
decide
it,
and
you
say
we're
going
to
arbitrate
in
alaska,
do
everything
in
alaska.
now,
that
does
make
sense.
unknown
speaker
but
they
pointed
out
about
six
ways
in
which,
once
we
go
down
that
road,
it's
actually
going
to
produce
all
kinds
of
inconvenience
and
mix-up
and
division
of
cases
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
which
suggests
their
way
makes
quite
a
lot
of
sense,
and
i
don't
want
you
to
leave
without
responding
to
the
various
points
that
they've
made
as
to
how
this
is
all
going
to
get
mixed
up
if
we
take
your
route
because
of
the
cases
being
divided.
remember,
the
other
example
was
the
example
of
an
instance
where
somebody
compels
arbitration,
they
suspend
the
case,
they
go
off
somewhere
to
arbitrate,
and
obviously
they'd
like
to
go
back
to
where
they
started.
unknown
speaker
if
they
agreed.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
1404(a)
is
meant
to
accomplish,
though,
and
district
judges,
recognizing
that
one
action
is
better
than
five,
or
even
two,
will
say,
okay,
this
is
a
place
of
proper
jurisdiction
and
venue,
but
we're
going
to
transfer
to
that
other
so
that
all
the
arbitrations
will
go
forward...
isn't
that
a
typical
use
of
1404(a)?
unknown
speaker
but
in...
it's
in
the
cases
that
you
put
where
arbitrations
are
often
held
in
multiple
cities,
multiple
venues,
where
the
arbitrators
themselves
are
from
chicago
and
new
york
and
los
angeles,
it's
not
clear
to
me
where
the
award
is
made.
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
multiple
hearings
in
multiple
cities.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
that
if
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
is
brought
in
one
court,
that
court
could
retain
jurisdiction,
cuts
against
your
now
answer
that
this
is
like
an
appellate
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
wagner.
mr.
bromberg,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
