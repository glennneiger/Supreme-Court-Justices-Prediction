justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
just
one
question,
and
that
is,
let's
assume
that
you're
right
that
mississippi
is
a
place
of
proper
venue
for
this
litigation,
there
is
the
general
rule
of
the
first
to
file
is
the
one
that
goes...
to
be
filed
goes
forward,
but
that's
not
an
iron-clad
rule,
so
could
it
be
that
the
alabama
district
court
would
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
defer
to
the
first
suit.
there's
nothing
that
obliges
the
alabama
court
to
give
way,
is
there?
