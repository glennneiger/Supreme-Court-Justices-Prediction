justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
cortez
byrd
chips
incorporated
and
the
respondent
bill
harbert
construction
company
agreed
that
any
disputes
arising
from
harbert’s
construction
of
a
mississippi
mill
for
cortez
byrd
would
be
decided
by
arbitration.
after
a
dispute
arose,
arbitration
was
conducted
in
alabama
and
harbert
received
an
award.
cortez
byrd
sought
to
vacate
and
modify
the
award
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
where
the
contract
was
performed.
seven
days
later,
harbert
sought
to
confirm
the
award
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
the
alabama
court
refused
to
dismiss
transfer
or
stay
its
action,
concluding
that
venue
was
proper
only
there,
and
it
entered
judgment
for
harbert.
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
venue
for
motions
to
confirm,
vacate,
or
modify
awards
was
exclusively
in
the
district
where
the
arbitration
award
was
made,
in
this
case,
alabama.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse.
the
federal
arbitration
act’s
venue
provisions
are
permissive,
allowing
a
motion
to
confirm,
vacate
or
modify
to
be
brought
either
in
the
district
where
the
award
was
made
or
in
any
district
proper
under
the
general
venue
statute.
and
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
