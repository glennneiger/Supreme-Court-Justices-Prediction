mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
specifically
whether
the
special
venue
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
are
exclusive
and
therefore
preclude
application
of
the
general
venue
statute
to
requests
to
confirm,
correct,
modify
or
correct
or
vacate
arbitration
agreements.
as
the
vast
majority
of
courts
and
commentators
to
consider
the
question
have
concluded,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
no.
the
faa's
special
venue
provisions
are
permissive
in
nature,
and
they
supplement
rather
than
supplant
the
general
venue
statute.
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
the
permissive
language
of
section
9
and
the
lack
of
any
restrictive
language
in
sections
9,
10,
and
11.
it
is
supported
by
the
context
in
which
that
language
is
used,
and
also
by
the
overall
structure
of
the
faa.
it
is
independently
supported
as
well
by
the--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--no,
your
honor.
the
reference
in
section
9
is
connected
to
an
application
for
a
confirmation
order.
in
sections
10
and
11
the
word
may
is
not
clearly
connected
to
such
an
application
because
there
is
no
reference
in
10
and
11
to
an
application.
what
is
important,
though,
is
that
section
9
is
clearly
a
permissive
provision.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
correct
as
far
as
it
pertains--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--well,
your
honor,
the
word
may
usually
connotes
discretion,
and
you're
suggesting
that
the
discretion
is
to
not
bring
an
action.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that
is
a
possible
interpretation.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
interpreted
may,
of
course,
to
indicate
discretion.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
that's
correct,
radzanower
did
apply
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
but
the
national
bank
provision
i
would
suggest
is
very
different
from
the
provision
that
is
before
this
court,
because
it
was
clear
that
congress
had
a
purpose
to
protect
a
particular
party
by
limiting
venue
to
a
particular
district
and
it
is,
i
think,
important
to
note
that
the
provision
at
issue
there,
which
of
course
has
since
been
superseded,
dealt
not
only
with
venue
in
federal
courts,
but
also
with
venue
in
state
courts
as
well.
the--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
yes,
your
honor.
the
panel
had
held
that
the
prior
fifth
circuit
decision
controlled,
and
we
did
decide
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
rather
than
seeking
a
hearing
en
banc.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
yes,
your
honor.
five
of
the
circuits
have
gone...
have
interpreted
these
venue
provisions
to
be
permissive
in
clear
holdings.
two
have
suggested
that
in
dicta.
there
are
three
circuits
that
have
adopted
a
restrictive
interpretation.
justice
scalia,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
we
think
that
a
permissive
interpretation
of
the
faa's
special
venue
provisions
is
not
only
supported
by
the
language
of
these
provisions,
and
although
it
may
be
possible
to
read
them
otherwise
we
do
think
that
the
most
natural
reading
is
a
permission
to
use
different
venue
statutes,
but
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
these
provisions
were
enacted.
as
we
indicate
on
page
14
of
our
opening
brief,
where
congress
has
intended
special
venue
statutes
to
be
restrictive,
it
has
frequently,
though
not
always,
used
explicitly
mandatory
or
restrictive
language.
moreover,
permissive
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
structure
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
if
a
restrictive
interpretation
is
adopted,
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
not
provide
enforcement
of
arbitrations
that
are
conducted
abroad.
however,
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
scherk
case,
the
faa
as
originally
enacted
was
intended
to
apply
to
such
arbitrations.
as
a
consequence,
a
restrictive
interpretation
would
create
a
gap
in
the
venue
created
by
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
i
am
aware
that
there
is
some
litigation
on
that
question.
i
must
admit,
though,
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
i
think
it
does,
because
i
think
what
respondent
has
argued
is
that
their
interpretation
better
fits
with
the
policies
underlying
the
act,
because
it
would
eliminate
any
questions
about
the
proper
venue,
and
would
therefore
be
more
consistent
with
the
speedy
and
efficient
resolution
of
disputes.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that's
correct.
the
petitioner
objected
to
the
location
that
was
chosen
by
the
american
arbitration
association
and
in
fact
they
filed
this
action
in
the
district
in
which
they
would
have
preferred
to
have
the
arbitration
conducted.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
brings
up
one
point,
that...
one
difficulty
with
the
restrictive
interpretation
that
respondents
have
suggested.
under
respondents'
interpretation
the
parties
can
only
agree
to
a
venue
if
that
pertains
to
an
application
to
vacate
and
it
is
in
an
arbitration
agreement,
because
that
is
the
only
type
of
forum
selection
clause
that
is
specifically
referred
to
in
the
faa,
so
they
would
construe,
for
example,
sections
10
and
11,
which
do
not
contain
any
specific
language
concerning
forum
selection
clauses,
to
exclude
such
clauses.
we
would
suggest
that
a
permissive
interpretation
would
better
fit
with
the
purposes
underlying
the
act,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
would
allow
parties
to
agree
to
litigate
in
the
most
convenient
venue.
now,
there
would
be
a
difference
between
applications
to
vacate
and
other
applications.
applications
to
vacate
would
be
judged
under
section
9,
which
provides
an
absolute
mandate
that
forum
selection
clauses
be
enforced.
other
forum
selection
clauses
would
be
enforced
under
the
general
rule
that
governs
forum
selection
clauses
that
this
court
announced
in
the
bremen
case.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
i
may
have
misspoke,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
applications
to
confirm
would
be
under
9.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
and
applications
to
correct,
modify,
or
vacate--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--would
be
judged
under
the
general
rule
which
governs
forum
selection
clauses.
furthermore,
under
a
permissive
interpretation
the
parties
would
be
able
after
an
arbitration
to
look
around
and
determine
what
is
the
most
convenient
venue.
under
respondents'
restrictive
interpretation,
because
section
9
refers
only
to
forum
selection
clauses
in
arbitration
agreements,
the
parties
would
not
be
able
to
do
so.
this
would
conflict
with
the
purposes
underlying
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
two
ways.
first,
it
would
prevent
the
parties
from
choosing
the
most
convenient
venue.
second,
it
would
prevent
the
enforcement
of
an
agreement
of
the
parties,
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
to
vindicate
the
parties--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--they
may,
your
honor,
and
in
that
situation
i
would
suggest
that
a
permissive
interpretation
would
also
be
the
more
reasonable
and
sensible
one,
because
it
would
allow
for
transfers
under
1404(a)
when
a
venue
that
is
selected
is
inconvenient.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
a
restrictive
interpretation
would
solve
some
but
not
all
of
that
problem,
because
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
faa
is
concurrent
with
the
state
courts,
and
i
don't
think
that
sections
9,
10,
and
11,
which
refer
only
to
the
united
states
district
courts,
would
apply
to
state
courts.
as
a
consequence,
a
party
that
is
interested
in
evading
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
section
10,
for
example,
would
simply
file
their
action
in
state
court
rather
than
in
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
many
situations
in
which
that
argument
would
not
apply.
parties
will
agree
to
arbitrate
in
distant
locations
that
they
would
find
it
inconvenient
to
litigate.
it
is
far
easier
to
arbitrate--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--they
may
want
the
arbitrator
who
lives
there,
they
may
be
trying
to
accommodate
the
convenience
of
witnesses,
neither
of
which
may
be
involved
in
a
post
arbitration
proceeding.
they
may
also
be
more
willing
to
accommodate
the
convenience
of
each
other.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that
is
quite
possible
as
well,
your
honor.
i
would
also
add
that
a
party
who
decides,
for
example,
to
conduct
an
arbitration
at
the
hotel
airport
in
dallas
or
in
chicago
may
be
unwilling
to
litigate
in
those
districts
because
they
don't
want
to
retain
local
counsel
in
those
districts,
so
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
venue
that
is
convenient
for
arbitration
may
prove
to
be
inconvenient
for
future
litigation.
i
would
also
add
that
it
is
possible
that
parties
may
want
to
consolidate
a
post
arbitration
proceeding
with
another
pending
litigation
between
the
parties,
or
they
may
wish
to
file
a
single
action
which
will
enforce
an
arbitration
and
also
allow
them
to
levy
against
property
of
the
other
party,
or
seek
execution
in
the
residence
of
the
other
party.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
it
would
not
be?
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
no,
that
would
be,
with
i
think
two
caveats,
your
honor.
one
would
be,
an
arbitration
forum
selection
clause
would
only
be
absolutely
enforceable
with
respect
to
an
application
to
confirm.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
right.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
sound
reason
for
that.
one
of
the
justifications
for
vacating
an
award
is
partiality
or
corruption
of
arbitrators,
also
fraud.
that
may
involve
the
testimony
of
recalcitrant
witnesses
from
the
district.
parties,
when
they
are
making
forum
selection
clauses
and
arbitration
agreements
can't
foresee
that
the
other
party
is
going
to
resort
to
fraud.
as
a
consequence,
they
should
not
be
forced
to
litigate
in
a
district
where
they
cannot
subpoena
necessary
parties.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
under
a
permissive
interpretation,
i
think
they
can.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
import
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
nearbo
case.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
that
would
be
the
case
under
the
restrictive
interpretation
that
respondents
have
suggested,
for
the
reason
that
it's
unclear
under
their
interpretation
why
congress
would
restrict
applications
to
vacate
to
a
single
district.
if
congress
intended
that
such
applications
be
decided
in
one
district
and
one
district
alone,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not
clear
that
consent
to
venue
in
a
different
district
would
be
allowed.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that
10
is
exclusive,
your
honor?
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
that
we
reach
that
position,
your
honor,
is
that
we
think
that
sections
9,
10,
and
11
have
to
be
construed
together.
as
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question
has
concluded,
they
must
be
interpreted
in
tandem
so
that
they
are
either
all
restrictive
or
all
permissive,
and
in
our
view,
since
section
9
is
clearly
permissive,
sections
10
and
11
have
to
be
construed
as
being
permissive
as
well.
now,
this
interpretation
is
also
supported,
as
i
said
earlier,
by
the
structure
of
the
act,
by
the
venue
gap
that
would
result,
and
also
by
the
unexplained
distinction
that
would
be
created
by
a
narrow
interpretation
between
sections
9,
10,
and
11,
and
the
federal
arbitration
act's
other
special
venue
provision
in
section
204.
we
also
think
that
a
permissive
interpretation
is
independently
supported
by
the
presumption
that
special
venue
statutes
are
supplemented
by
the
general
venue
statute.
this
presumption,
which
courts
and
commentators
have
found
implicit
in
this
court's
decision
in
suarez,
is
based
upon
congress'
historical
practice.
historically,
congress
has
used
special
avenue
statutes
in
order
to
expand,
not
restrict,
the
venue
available
under
the
general
venue
statute.
moreover,
as
i
indicated
before,
where
congress
has
intended
a
special
venue
statute
to
be
exclusive,
it
has
normally
used
explicitly
restrictive
mandatory
language.
this
suggests
that,
in
the
absence
of
such
restrictive
or
mandatory
language,
the
special
venue
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
be
supplemented
by
the
general
venue
statute,
and
this
presumption
is
supported
by
important
pragmatic
consideration.
there
are
hundreds
of
special
venue
statutes
in
the
u.s.
code.
if
all
of
these
venue
statutes
were
interpreted
restrictively,
then
the
general
rules
that
section
1391
attempts
to
create
would
be
subject
to
a
patchwork
of
arcane
and
perhaps
unintended
exceptions.
as...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--i
think,
your
honor,
that...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
as
part
of--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--of
section
11.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
i
think
section
11
has
substantive
provisions,
and
it
also
has
venue
provisions,
and
the
substantive
provisions,
after
this
court's
decision
in
southland,
i
would
suggest,
have
to
be
read
broadly
to
apply
to
any
court
that
is--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
should
read
the
reference
to
the
united
states
court
in
and
for
the
district
wherein
the
award
was
made
as
an
allusion
back
to
the
standards
in
section
9.
there
are
other
places
in
this
statute
which
this
court
said
in
transit
is
an
ambiguously
drafted
statute,
where
certain
words
are
used
to
refer
to
more
complicated
contexts.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
is
a
perfectly
clearly
drafted
statute,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
scenario
that
you
are
posing
would
cause
certain
problems.
the
first
and
foremost
would
be,
it
would
require
piecemeal
litigation
in
certain
cases.
where
there
is
a
forum
selection
agreement
that
is
enforceable
under
section
9--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--your
honor,
actually
i
would
suggest
that
the--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
under
our
interpretation
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
and
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
problem
that...
justice
scalia,
the
problem
that
you're
identifying
is
a
problem
with
the
restrictive
interpretation
that
respondents
have
suggested,
because
under
their
interpretation,
where
there
is
a
forum
selection
clause
that
is--
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
--enforceable
under
section
9,
you
may
have
to
bring
motions
to
vacate
or
motions
to
modify
in
one
district
and
motions
to
confirm
in
another.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
i'd
also
like
to
address
one
argument
that
respondent
has
made,
and
that's
that
their
interpretation,
by
posing
a
rigid
and
restrictive
rule,
would
serve
the
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
as
i
have
already
suggested,
i
think
that
the
value
or
the
benefit
of
that
rule
is
significantly
undermined
by
the
fact
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts
for
federal
arbitration
proceedings.
i
would
also
suggest,
however,
that
there
are
costs
to
a
rigid
and
inflexible
rule.
it
would
require
piecemeal
litigation
in
certain
cases.
it
would
also
prevent
agreements
on
the
most
convenient
forum
from
being
enforced.
it
would
force
litigation
in
certain
cases
to
be
conducted
in
inconvenient
fora,
because
no
transfers
under
1404(a)
would
be
possible.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
an
issue
that
this
court
has
debated
long
and
hard
in
southland
and
its
progeny.
i
think
that
southland
does
find
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies
at
least
in
certain
provisions
to
state
courts.
mr.

well,
your
honor,
certainly
actions
to
vacate,
some
actions
to
vacate
must
be
brought
in
state
court,
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
moses
h.
cone,
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
provide
for
independent
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
as
a
consequence,
a
case
that
was
between
two
parties
resident
from
the
same
state,
or
that
otherwise
did
not
satisfy
diversity
jurisdiction,
could
not
be
brought
in
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
consequence,
some
actions
at
least
to
vacate,
modify,
or
correct
arbitration
awards
will
have
to
be
brought
in
state
court.
now,
there
is
another
problem
with
respondent's
interpretation
as
well.
according
to
their
interpretation,
in
1925,
when
congress
passed
the
federal
arbitration
act
it
intended
to
exclude
application
of
the
general
venue
statute.
at
that
time,
however,
the
general
venue
statute
basically
provided
only
for
venue
in
the
residence
of
the
defendant,
and
respondent
has
failed
to
suggest
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
prevent
applications
to
confirm
or
to
vacate
or
modify
to
be
brought
in
the
residence
of
the
defendant.
finally,
your
honors,
i
would
suggest
that
their
interpretation
would
complicate
the
arbitration
process
itself,
because
it
would
make
parties
less
likely
to
reach
compromises
and
accommodations
in
the
arbitration
process
when
they
are
determining
where
the
location
of
the
arbitration
should
be.
that
question,
as
it
stands
now,
is
often
quite
contentious.
if
that
were
given
the
added
significance
of
determining
where
future
litigation
would
be
conducted,
parties
would
be
less
likely
to
reach
compromises,
and
i
think
that's
particularly
true
for
parties
such
as
petitioner,
who
is
from
a
rural
area
in
mississippi.
he
may
be
willing
to
agree
to
accommodate
the
convenience
of
arbitrators
to
conduct
an
arbitration
in
another
state,
at
a
major
airport
that
has
a
hub,
but
he
would
be
unwilling,
or
at
least
less
willing
to
conduct
an
arbitration
there
if
he
knew
that
any
subsequent
litigation
would
be
conducted
there.
in
sum,
your
honors,
i
think
that
a
permissive
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
language
of
the
faa,
by
the
context
in
which
that
language
is
used,
and
by
the
structure.
it
is
also
supported
by
the
presumption
that
special
venue
statutes
are
supplemented
by
the
general
venue
statute,
and
by
the
policies
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
more
reasonable
and
sensible
nature
of
the
rule
that
it
would
create.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument.
mr.
daniel
h.
bromberg
well,
your
honor,
we
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
brief
that
question,
but
i
would
add...
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
what
i
think
several
difficulties
with
a
response
like
that.
the
first
is,
i
think
that
it
is
unfair
to
require
a
party
like
the
petitioner,
who
has
objected
to
arbitration
being
conducted
in
a
particular
place,
to
force
them,
whether
through
a...
an
absolute
rule,
as
respondent
is
suggesting,
or
through
a
presumptive
rule,
to
litigate
post
arbitration
proceedings
in
that
district.
the
second
thing
that
i
would
add
is
that
some
of
the
problems
that
i
pointed
out
about
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
sections
9,
10,
and
11
would
also
be
created
by
a
presumptive
rule.
in
particular,
it
would
burden
the
arbitration
process
itself.
the
prearbitration
sparring,
in
some
cases,
over
where
an
arbitration
should
be
located
would
be
complicated
as
much
by
a
presumptive
rule
as
it
would
be
by
an
absolute
restriction.
