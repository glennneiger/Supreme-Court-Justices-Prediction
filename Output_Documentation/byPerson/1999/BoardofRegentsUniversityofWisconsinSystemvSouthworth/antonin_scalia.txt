justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
ullman,
you
say...
you
say
it's
viewpoint-neutral.
what
does
that...
i
mean,
somebody
has
to
make
a
decision
whether
it's
the
students
or
the
university
which
speakers
are
going
to
be
funded
and
which
aren't.
what
if
there
is
a...
a
student
chapter
of
the
kkk
that...
that
applies
for
funding?
i
assume
somebody
makes
the
decision
that
they
will
or
will
not
get
funding.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
automatically?
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
that...
that's
what
i
didn't
understand.
is
it
the
case
that
all
of
the
groups
that
didn't
get
funding
under
this
program,
didn't
request
funding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
legitimacy
of
the...
of
the
practice
as
a
whole
was
not
at
issue
in
rosenberger,
as
i
recall.
it
was
simply
whether,
if
you
have
it,
you
have
to
provide
it
to...
to
particular
religious
groups,
as
well
as
to
everybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
wispirg
is
just
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what...
what
mechanism
it
was
funded
through.
was
it
just
providing
student
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
does
it
serve
them
with?
meals?
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
could
call
any
speech
serving
students
then,
i
mean,
if...
if
that's
your
definition
of
serving
students,
telling
them
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they've
certainly
challenged
that...
that
this
organization
engaged
in
activities
that
didn't
constitute
student
services...
justice
antonin
scalia
including
lobbying.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
we're
talking
about
what
the
other
side
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
well
as
the
kkk.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
that
organization?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
let...
let
me
understand
what
you're
saying.
is
it
only
the
services
branch
of
funding
that
can
be
mandated
or
vetoed
by
a
student
referendum?
i
thought
the
student
referendum
could...
could
knock
out
somebody
who
gets
another
kind
of
funding
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now...
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
it
your
statement
that
the
student
referendum
only
applies
to
the
services
category?
is
there
somewhere
where
we
can
see
this
in
the
university
regulations
or
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
we
know,
the
student
referendum
applies
to
all...
all
of
these
three
different
sorts
of
funding.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
partisan
political,
though.
that's...
that's
a
viewpoint
it
seems
to
me.
if
i
hold
these
views
but
i'm
not
a
democrat,
i
can...
you
know,
i
can
spew
them.
but
if...
if
i...
and
get
funded
for
it.
but
if
i...
once
i
affiliate
with
a
party,
then
i
can't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't...
i
don't...
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
government
speech.
i
thought
the
government
speech
doctrine
applied
to
speech
which
the
government
does
not
disclaim.
i
mean,
i'm
sure
when...
when
they
have
these
forums
of
the
sort
you're
discussing
now,
the
university
says,
you
know,
when
we
bring
in
whoever
it
is,
his
views
are
not
necessarily
those
of
the
university.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
that's
the
end
of
the
government
speech
doctrine.
the
purpose
of
the
government
speech
doctrine
is
to
enable
the
government
to
take
positions
on...
on
public
issues
against
the
kkk,
against
all
sorts
of
things
that
the
government
thinks
is
bad.
and
that
doesn't
violate
the
first
amendment.
the
government
is
entitled
to
take
positions.
but
what
the...
the
hypothetical
that's
been
posed
to
you
does
not
involve
the
university
taking
positions.
it
just
involves
the
university
sponsoring
it.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
that
that
invokes
the
government
speech
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
see
that
too
where...
where
the
university
selects
professors
and
decides
what
courses
will
be...
will
be
taught
and
so
forth
as
part
of
its
instructional
mission
and
with...
you
know,
with
an
eye
to
the
subject
matter.
it
won't
let
any
subject
matters
be
taught
and
so
forth,
nor
any
views.
i
mean,
it'll...
you
know,
scientifically
worthless
views
it
won't
let
in.
that's
not
viewpoint-neutral,
but
it's
part
of
the
university's
instructional
program.
and
if
the
hypothetical
were
the
university
establishes
a
forum
in
which
it
selects
the
speakers,
then...
then
i
could
understand
that
that's
part
of
its
instructional
program.
but
when
the
university
just
sets
up
a
forum
and
says,
we'll
pay
the
money,
the
students
can
decide
what...
what
speakers
they
want,
you...
you
say
that
still
comes
within
government
speech
because
it
is,
quote,
sponsored
by
the
university.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that,
if...
if
what
you
mean
by
pulling
the
strings
and
operating
it
is
selecting
the
speakers.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
government
that
has
nothing
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
doing
it
just
the
way
they're
doing
it
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course...
of
course...
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i'm
not...
you
accept
the
proposition
that
this
is
a...
a
timeless
function
of
universities?
i
don't
know,
from
the
middle
ages
they
have
funded
student
groups
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
they
have
diverse
professors
whom
they
hire
and...
and
who
are
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
university
presumably.
this
is...
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
old
is...
is
this
fee?
i
just
wonder
whether
universities
are
going
to
crumble
if...
if
they
can't
do
this
kind
of
thing.
how...
is
this
a
longstanding
tradition
in...
in
universities?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
accept
that
the...
the
right
not
to
speak
is
simply
the
right
not
to
have
yourself
associated
with...
with
that
view?
i
thought...
i
thought
we
had
a
case
that
said
a
newspaper
could
not
be
compelled
to
accept
advertising
that
would
obviously
be
representing
the
views
of
somebody
else
and
not
of
the
newspaper
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
your
being
identified
with
that...
with
that
view.
you
shouldn't...
you
shouldn't
have
to
have
your...
your
means
used
to
espouse
it
if
you
don't
want
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
easy
part.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
were
talking
here
about
a
university
newspaper.
isn't
the
argument
available
that
this
is
one
of
the
instructional
devices
at
the
university...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
it
should
take
particular
views
is...
is
no
more
extraordinary
than
that
you
should
have
a
communist
professor?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
also
happens.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
really
services.
