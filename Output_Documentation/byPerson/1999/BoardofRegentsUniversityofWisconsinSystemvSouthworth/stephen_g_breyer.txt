justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
the
first
amendment
is
supposed
to,
in
part,
protect
views
that
are
unpopular.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would
think
a
referendum
would
pick
out
the
views
that
on
campus
were
popular.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
is
that
you
suggest
we
do
about
this
campus
referendum?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
your
view
the
campus
could
have
only
liberal
organizations
which
are
just
popular
on
campuses
and
the
conservative
ones,
which
happen
to
be
very
unpopular...
they
wouldn't
give
any
of
the
money
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
on...
on
this...
on
this...
through
this
route.
you'd
call
it
a
service.
is
that...
is
that
basically
what
you're
saying?
in
other
words,
if
it's
called
a
service,
money
for
a
service,
in
your
opinion
they
could
give
them
only
to
the
liberal
organizations
which
are
popular
and
not
give
them
to
the
conservative
ones
which
are
unpopular,
if
it's
called
a
service.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
elicit
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is...
what
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
criteria
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
quite
a
big
problem,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
your...
your
own
amici
have
run
away
from
you
on
this
wispirg
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
so
now
if
this
student
referendum
applies
to
the
whole
business,
it's
going
to
be
pretty
hard
to
get
the
minorities
funding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
leave
that
referendum
out
of
it
on
the
theory
that
it
isn't
really
developed
fully
in
front
of
us
in
the
lower
court
opinions
in
anything
and
simply
express
no
view
on
it
and
deal
with
the
rest
of
it?
what
would
be
wrong
with
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
all
that's
true.
what
i'm
thinking
is
that
most
of
the
case,
except
for
that,
is
presented
to
us
in
terms
of
what
the
first
amendment
requires
in
respect
to
a
system
that's
viewpoint-neutral.
the
problem
with
that
referendum
is...
is
perhaps
it
isn't.
and
so,
would
it
make
sense
for
us
and
can
we
in
this
case
leave
that
part
of
it
out,
say
it
isn't
developed
fully
in
the
record
or
in...
in
the
courts
below,
even
if
it
is
in
the
record,
and
deal
with
the
rest
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why...
why...
if
you
can...
i
can
understand
how
you
analogize
it
to
abood
and
the
bar
cases...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you're
saying
that
here,
as
a
condition
for
going
to
the
state
university...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
give
money,
let's
say,
to
the
iww,
the...
the
wobblies,
or
something...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
or...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
very
analogous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
the
reply
is,
that's
not
what's
happened
here.
it's
not
that
you've
giving
money
to
a
union
or
the
wobblies
or
somebody.
rather,
what
you're
doing
is
giving
money
to
a
bunch
of
organizations
so
that
all,
in
a
viewpoint-neutral
way,
have
a
chance
to
engage
the
students
in
a
certain
amount
of
activity
that
is
at
least
distantly
related
to
a
educational
objective.
and
so,
why
doesn't
that
difference
make
the
difference?
whether
you
call
it
a
public
forum,
whether
you
don't
call
it
a
public
forum,
who
cares?
basically
the
difference
is
what
i
just
described,
and
why
doesn't
that
make
the
difference
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment?
