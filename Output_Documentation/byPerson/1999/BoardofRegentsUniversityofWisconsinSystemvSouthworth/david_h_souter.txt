justice
david
h.
souter
is
it...
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
ultimate
control
over
the
payment
of
funds
in
this
category
is
retained
by
the
university?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
university,
at
least
in
the
first
category,
can...
i
guess
they
haven't
done
it,
but
they
could
say,
no,
we're
not
going
to
pay
out
the
money
for...
for
what
you
have
selected
in
this
respect.
justice
david
h.
souter
including
the
referendum
category?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
argue,
as
some
of
the
amici
did,
that
in
fact
for
that
reason,
you
should
analogize...
we
should
analogize
the
position
of
the...
the
university
to
the
university's
position
when
it
decides
how
to
spend
its
own
money,
how
to
choose
its
curriculum,
how
to
invite
speakers
to
the
campus,
if
it
does
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
argue?
is
there
a
reason
not
to
argue
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're
saying
the
analogy
is
not
perfect,
in
other
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
you...
do
you...
do
you
wish
to
adopt
the
position
that...
that
some
of
the
friends
of
the
court
have
taken,
or...
or
do
you,
in
effect,
wish
us
not
to
adopt
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
ullman,
i
have
a
basic
question
about
why
we
should,
in
the
first
instance,
adopt
the...
the
forum
analysis
here.
it's
a
metaphorical
forum.
i
mean,
we
start
with
that.
we're
not
talking
about
a
physical
public
forum.
and
there...
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
what
goes
on.
one
way,
to
be
sure,
is
to
look
at
it
as
a
metaphorical
forum,
and
another
way
is
not
to
look
at
it
as
a
forum
and
simply
to
look
at
it
as
a
mechanism
for
funding
various
groups
which
have
ideological
and
various
partisan
identifications.
one...
or
the
question
in
my
mind
is
what
reason
is
there
to
adopt
the...
the
forum
metaphor
rather
than
to
look
directly
at
who
gets
the
money.
one
reason
that
occurred
to
me
would
be
that
there
was
no
other
way
or
no
practical
way
to
have
this
sort
of
ferment
of
comment
and...
and
speech
except
in
this
fashion.
and
yet,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
case
because
i
think...
what...
70
percent
of
the
student
organizations
seem
to
get
along
without
going
through
this
process
and
availing
themselves
of
the
activity
fund.
so,
my...
i'm
left
with
the
question
of
why
should
we
adopt
the
forum
metaphor
as
opposed
simply
to
looking
to
where
the
money
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
it
change...
does
it
change
radically?
i
mean,
are
there
years
in
which
98
percent
get
funding?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well,
it
still
leaves
me,
i
think,
with...
regardless
of
what
the
exact
proportions
may
be,
it
still
leaves
me
with
a
question,
why
we
should
adopt
the...
the
forum
metaphor.
and
if...
if
the
argument
were
you
can't
have
the
kinds
of
speech
which
is
valuable
in
a
university
setting
without
this
practice,
and
hence
the
forum
metaphor,
in
fact,
is
a
way
of
describing
a...
a...
at
least
a
value
of
great
importance,
then
i
could
understand
that
as
a
reason
for
adopting
the
metaphor.
but
given
the
fact
that
there
are
so
many
organizations
in
which
i
presume
speech
is
going
on
and
people
are
coming
to
visit
and
speak
and
so
on,
who
don't
avail
themselves
of
this,
i'm...
i
don't
have
that
reason.
at
least
it's
not
obvious
to
me.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
other
reasons
are
for
adopting
that...
that
form
of
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
have...
and
i
don't
want
to
get
picky
about
it,
but
do
you
have
record
support
here
for
the
proposition
that
you
simply
cannot
get
prominent
outside
voices
who
stimulate
thought
without
this
kind
of
centralized
funding
mechanism?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sure,
but
lots
of
organizations
invite
us
to
speak,
and
they
come
up
with
their
own
honorariums.
i
don't
know
why
that
necessarily
implies
the
need
for
the
university
to...
to
be
the
middle
man
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
only
to
prevent...
i...
i
take
it
that
partisan
organizations
are
excluded
from
these
benefits
not
merely
because
they...
they
lobby
but
because
they
are
partisan
political
organizations.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that...
and...
well,
maybe
i
shouldn't
get
ahead
of
myself.
why...
why
does
the
university
so
accept
them?
what's
the
reason
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
leave
religion
out
for
a
minute
and...
and
just
talk
about
politics.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
core
first
amendment
value
is
in
political
speech.
why
is
political
speech
excluded?
justice
david
h.
souter
partisan
political
speech.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
excluded?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
that
the
university
believes
there's
a
first
amendment
reason
for
the
exclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
just
doesn't
want
politics
in
any
way
that
might
be
identified
with
the
university.
it
doesn't
want
to
get
in
dutch
with
the
legislature
basically
i
guess.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you're
excluding
that
kind
of
politics,
what
does
that
do
to
your...
to
your
forum
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
rather
than
an
odd
forum,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
excludes
a
narrow
band
which
in
fact
is
the...
is
the
principal
object
in
the
first
instance
of
first
amendment
protection.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
can
the...
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
university
could
exclude
funding
for
an
avant
garde
arts
organization?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
right.
that's
the
way
it
sounds
to
me
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you've
got
the
same
point
with
your
political
exclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
mean
by
sponsorship?
in
other
words,
what...
what
is
this
magical
quality
of
sponsorship?
isn't
the
only
issue
is...
is
speech
being
promoted
and...
and
who,
in
effect,
is...
is
responsible
for
paying
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
getting
at
i
think
is...
is
the
government
ultimately
responsible
for
this.
isn't
that
it?
i
mean,
if
the
government
is...
if...
if
the
government
authority
is
being
used
to
raise
the
money
and...
and
thereby
to
make
the
invitation
possible
and
the
government
approves
this
use,
the
government
establishes
the
means
by
which
selection
shall
be
made,
it
sounds
like
government
speech.
and
the...
you're...
you're
introducing
at
least
a
rhetorical
element
of
sponsorship,
and
i
just
don't
understand
what
sponsorship
might
be
in
addition
to
these
items
i've
just
checked
off.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
situation
in
which
the
university
says,
we
think
a
babble
of
voices
is
a
very
good
thing?
is...
and
we
are
going
to
pay
for
those
voices.
we
are
going
to
pay
to
get
them
here.
you
can
see
that
and
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
too
would
fall
within
the
umbrella
of
government
speech,
or
it
should.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
position
or
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lorence,
you...
you
have
and
members
of
the
court
have
from
time
to
time
invoked
or
mentioned
the
principle
of
the
right
not
to
speak.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
this.
i
at
least
have
understood
the
right
not
to
speak
to
be
a
right
not
to
a
vow
of
silence,
but
rather
a...
a
right
not
to
espouse
a
position.
if
that
is
correct,
then
the
argument
that
you
keep
being
met
with,
that
in
fact
there
is
such
a
variety
of
voices
here,
that
this
funding
mechanism
simply
cannot
be
analogized
to
being
forced
to
speak
a
particular
position,
adopt
a
particular
position,
or
sponsor
a
particular
position.
would
you
comment
on
that?
is
that,
as
i
have
just
characterized
it,
a
proper
way
of
looking
at
the...
at
the
right
not
to
speak,
and...
and
if
so,
why
are
you
not
vulnerable
to
the
argument
that
when
there
is
no
one
voice,
the
principle
really
does
not
support
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't...
you
don't
place
your...
your
objecting
students,
i
take
it,
in
the
same
position
as
a
newspaper
which
is
asserting
a
peculiar
editorial
freedom.
maybe
you
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
promoting...
you're...
you're
right.
they're
promoting
a
message,
but
that
doesn't
describe
the
totality
of
what's
going
on.
they
are
facilitating
the
promotion
of
a
series
of
messages
which
may
be,
indeed,
quite
inconsistent
as
among
themselves.
and
whatever
that
is,
that
is
something
different
from
being
compelled
as
a
union
member
or
a
bar
association
member
to
take
a
particular...
to
fund
a
particular
position
in
the
course
of...
of
partisan
political
activity.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
again,
your...
the
force
of
your
argument
depends
on
denying
that
what
you
are...
what
your
students
are
supporting
is
a
funding
mechanism,
is
a
pot
from
which
money
is
taken.
instead,
you
analyze
it
down
immediately
to
the
individual
groups.
and
i'm,
in
effect,
asking
you
the
converse
of
the
question
that
i
asked
the...
the
lawyer
on
the
other
side.
why
is
it
that
i
should
look
at
this...
why
should
i
analyze
this
case
as
being
funding
for
individual
groups
as
opposed
to
funding
for
a...
a
pot
of
gold
from
which
quite
disparate
and
inconsistent
voices
can
have
access?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
value
of
the
auditorium,
in
a
way,
is
converted
into
messages.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
take
the
long
view,
at
some
point
auditoriums
wear
out
and
they
fall
down
with
use.
so,
you
can
say
that
every
group
that
packs
the
auditorium
is
taking
something
out
of
the
fabric
and...
and
is
using
it
for
the...
for
the
purpose
of...
of
espousing
the
group's
message.
the
only
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
one
of
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the...
the
argument...
well,
but...
that...
that...
let's...
let's
say
you...
you
may
have
two
arguments
here.
one,
that
the
funding
is
going
further
than
the
funding
should
go
for
purposes
of
speech.
that's
one
argument
i
think
you
were
getting
at
at
the
end.
and
i...
i
don't
mean
to
dismiss
that.
but
if
you
put
that
to
the
side
for
the
moment,
the...
the
argument
that
the...
that
the
money
is
being
used
to...
to
fund
and
espouse
a
particular
speaker's
viewpoint,
is
simply
a
way,
i
think
a...
perhaps
a...
is...
the
answer
to
that
is
simply
the
same
answer
as
the
auditorium
answer.
the
auditorium
answer
would
be,
look,
we
can't
have
a
babble
of
voices
without
an
auditorium
for
the...
for
them
to
speak.
and
with
respect
to
your
objection,
the
university
would
say,
we
simply
cannot
have
this
variety
of
speakers
without
some
underwriting.
we've
got
to
get
them
here.
they...
they
won't
come
otherwise,
and
we
ought
to
have
this
speech.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
again,
the...
the
university's
role
in
supplying
the
auditorium
and...
and
a
funding
mechanism
is
essentially
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
would
have
had
some
new
union
officers,
if
they
had
been
doing
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
didn't
want
to
get
into
this,
but
if...
if
you
get
to
that
point,
then
you
get
to...
really
to
the
question
of...
of
your
analogy
with...
with
abood.
and...
and
the...
the
union
organization,
in
fact,
is...
is
a...
is
a
membership
organization.
and
we
don't
have
that
feature
here.
and...
and
so,
when...
when
you
carry
the...
the
argument
as
you
did,
the
question
would
then
come
up
in
the
union
or
the
bar
association
case,
is...
is
this
going
to
the
very
justification
for
compelling
the
membership
or
the...
or
the
support
for
activities?
so,
i
think
your...
i
think
that...
i
think
that
injects
another
element
in
the
argument.
