now,
as
to
that,
are
the
funds
paid
out
by
the
board
of
regents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
they
limited
to
certain
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
mean
the
funds
that
are
paid
out.
are
they
paid
out
to
support
telephone
bills
or
letter
writing
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could...
could
we
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
first
question?
there
are
three
different
kinds
of
funding
programs
going
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
gff,
which
you
say
is
analogous
to
a
forum,
and
then
the...
the
student
referendum
mechanism,
and
what's
the
third?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
a
stipulation
in
the
record
that
the
activity
fund
is
administered
in
a
viewpoint-neutral
fashion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
that
extend
only
to
the
gsff
money
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
asm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
stipulation
does
not
extend
to
the
student
referendum
mechanism
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
there
was
stipulation
in
the
record
that
the
funding
process
is
administered
in
a
viewpoint-neutral
fashion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
such
a
stipulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
i
guess
that
doesn't
extend
to
the
referendum
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
university
uses
tuition
money
to
have
speakers
that
come
from
all
these
various
perspectives
at
a
university
auditorium?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
use
the
tuition
money
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
university
does
that
and
lets
a
student
group
meet
to
decide
what
speakers
will
be
invited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
university
is
saying,
we
want
every
student
to
pay
$
50
a
semester
to
an
activity
fund
and
we
require
that
and
it's
going
to
be
used
for
these
activities,
then
why
isn't
that
government
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
don't
understand
that.
surely
the
government
can
invite
an
outside
group
to
come
and
give
a
speech
or
put
on
a
presentation
using
government
money,
tuition
money
to
ask
them
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you'd
have
the
same
situation.
