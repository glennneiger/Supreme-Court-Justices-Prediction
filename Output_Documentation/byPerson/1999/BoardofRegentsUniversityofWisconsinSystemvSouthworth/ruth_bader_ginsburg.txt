but
who...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
performs
the
checking
function?
you
say
in
your
brief
that
there's
one
exception
for
partisan
political
activity.
and
justice
kennedy
brought
that
up
as
one
possibility.
who
exercises
the
check
to
determine
whether
these
student
groups
are
engaged
in
partisan
political
activity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
given
the
position
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
never
got
to
the
point
of
examining
these
discrete
questions
because
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
whole
thing
was
no
good.
so,
it
may
well
be
that
this
separate
category
bears
further
pretrial
development.
but
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
referendum
would
also
work
to
de-fund,
as
i
understand
it.
that
the
students
could
veto.
if
somebody
gets
through
the
regular
process
and
the
students
can
have
a
referendum
and
say
we
don't
want
that
group
funded.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
ullman,
would
you
just
clarify
one
point
for
me?
will
you
tell
me
how
the
university
defines
partisan
political
activity?
what
falls
under
that
label
that's
not
permitted
to
be
funded?
i
mean,
one
question
came
up
about
lobbying,
and
i
wasn't
sure
whether
you
said
yes
or
no
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
lobbying
is
definitely
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
aren't
they
doing
that
if
they...
if
there
is
no
student
activity
fee
and
it
just
comes
out
of
tuition?
i
mean,
they're
compelled
to
pay
for
all
kinds
of
things
they
may
not
believe
in
that
are
being
taught
on
the
campus.
