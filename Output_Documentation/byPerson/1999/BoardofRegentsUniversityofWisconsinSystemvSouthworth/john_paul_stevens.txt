may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
this...
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
question,
if...
some
of
these
things
obviously
are
troubling
that
have
been
identified
in
the
questions.
i'm
wondering
if
they
are
troubling
just
because
it's
financed
by
student
speech
or
would
it
be
equally
troubling
if
it
was
financed
out
of
the
general
tuition
or
appropriation
by
the
legislature.
would
you
think
a
program
would
be
valid
if
it
were
financed
with
state
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
that...
i'm
trying
to
leave
that
out
and
ask
you
whether
you
think
the
program
has
these
vices
in
it
that
would
survive
no
matter
how
it
was
funded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
it's
state
money
or
student
money,
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
done
exactly
the
same
as
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
would...
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
salvage
the
program
by
abolishing
student
fees
and
increasing
the
tuition
in
exactly
the
same
amount?
would
you
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
the
program
if
they
did
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
it
just
the
way
they
do
it
in
this
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
but
a
fairly
simple
solution.
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
think
it
would
be
a
valid
solution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
going
to
do
exactly
what
they
do
here
except
they
just
raise
the
money
a
little
different...
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
thing
that
strikes
me
about
the
case
is
i'm
not...
i'm
wondering
if
the
source
of
the
funds
is
really
the
problem
or
the
way
in
which
their
program
is
administered
is
the
real
problem.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
sort
out
in
my
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
understand
why
the
university
couldn't
say
we'll
run
it
exactly
as
we've
been
running
it.
we'll
delegate
the
authority
to
make
the
decisions
of
the
various
student
groups,
but
instead
of
using
a
student
activity
fee,
we'll
just
put
in
a
pot
of
money
at
their
disposal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you'd
still
have
the
same
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
maybe
you
wouldn't.
you
haven't
really
made
it
clear
to
me
whether
you
would
or...
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
whatever
the
mission
of
this
program
is.
they
just
say,
we're
going
to
finance
it
in
a
different
way.
would
it
become
all
right
or
wouldn't
it?
i
can't
figure
out
from
your...
you've
given
me
a
lot
of
legal
answers,
but
i
don't
know,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
yes
or
no
question
and
i
don't...
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
way
the
record
shows
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
i
think
you're
right.
i
mean,
that's...
that's...
but
that...
if
you
agree
with
that,
then
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
your
people
object
to
some
of
the
speech
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
it's
just
that
the...
the
program
as
a
whole
is
objectionable
because
it's
slanted
one
way
or
another
and
funds
certain
activities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
an
activities
fee?
90
percent
goes
for
sports
events,
5
percent
for
the
annual
yearbook,
and
5
percent
for
the
student
newspaper.
would
that
be
permissible?
because...
and
the
student
newspaper
gets
captured
by
a
communist
board
of
directors
in
editorial
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
happens
all
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
it
did
when
i
was
in
school.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
that
answer?
what
about
that
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
might
say
also
there's
a
greater
danger
that
the
student
will
be
identified
as
associated
with
the
views
of
the
school
paper
than
when
you
got
an
indirect
thing
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
newspaper
is
the
hard
part.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's...
it's
captured
by
a
group
with
which
the
person
who
has
to
pay
the
activity
fee
violently
disagrees,
particularly
because
it's
the
university
of
chicago
daily
maroon
that's
associated
with
all
students
of
the
university
of
chicago.
of
course,
that's
not
a
state...
