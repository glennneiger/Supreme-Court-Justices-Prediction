justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
in...
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
three
different
things
happening
here.
one
is
that
the
funds
are
allocated
through
the
student
council
in
a
viewpoint-neutral
manner,
as
you've
just
said.
secondly,
funding
can
result
from
a
referendum.
like
wispirg
had
a
referendum
and
the
funds
were
paid
by
reason
of
the
referendum,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
not
viewpoint-neutral.
and
third...
and
third...
some
of
the
funds
are
used
or
may
be
used...
i'm
not
sure...
for
what
we
might
call
quintessential
political
activity,
hypothetically...
this
didn't
happen...
going
to
the
new
hampshire
primary
and
attending
rallies
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
three
of
those
present
maybe
different
problems,
and
at
some
point
in
your
argument,
if
you
could
just
address
those.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
wispirg
for
a
moment.
number
one,
that
doesn't
match
the
public
forum
description
you've
given
us
so
far
because
this
was
a
direct
referendum
where
51
percent
of
the
votes
were
enough
to...
to
fund
$
40,000
plus
to
wispirg.
so
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
much
different
from
the
public
forum
argument
that
you've
been
making.
secondly,
just
on
the
chief
justice's
point,
the
wispirg
application
says
that
through
its...
through
organizing
new
chapters
throughout
the
state,
this
additional
income
will
allow
wispirg
to
hire
professional
staff
necessary
to
play
an
even
more
effective
role
on
environmental
and
consumer
protection
issues.
now,
if
you're...
if
you're
going
to
be
candid
with
us
to
tell
us
what's
happening
here,
you
should
address
that
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not...
that's
not
viewpoint-neutral...
a
viewpoint-neutral
forum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
we
have
two
cases
here
and
not
just
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you...
if
you
can't
defend
wispirg
on
a
public
forum
analogy,
how
do
you
defend
it?
i'm
still
waiting
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
sure
the
republican
and
the
democratic
parties
think
the
same
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
includes
hiring
professional
staff
to
have
a
more
effective
role
in
environmental
and
consumer
protection
issues.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
service
in
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
service
in
your
view,
what
i've
just
quoted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's...
all
that...
all
that
is
a
service.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
your
view
was
the
newspaper
in
the
rosenberger
case
a
service?
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
is
as
you
define
it,
and
i
simply
can't
buy
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
take
it
there
are
two
principles.
one
is
that
the
state
university
can
teach
what
it
wants
as
it
wants
to
teach
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
other
is
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment
to
compel
a
private
person
to
speak
when
he
or
she
does
not
want
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we're
trying
to
accommodate
these
two
principles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
a
question
of
proximity
and
degree.
there
are
going
to
be
some
close
calls.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
in
your
view
is
not
a
close
call
because
we're
not
using
tuition
funds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
concept...
context
of
the
university
setting
from...
from
ancient
times,
universities
have
been
places
where
ideas,
including
political
ideas...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
debated.
that's
part
of
the
life
of
the
university.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
difficulty
with
your
position
is
that
you're
asking
us
to
do
something
which
is
against
the
tradition
of
universities
for
many,
many
years,
many
centuries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
they've
had
diverse
speech.
they've
had
diverse...
of
course,
they...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
they
call
it...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
when
it
does,
they
call
it
a
service.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
allowed
opt-out
as...
as
abood,
and
then
you
have
students
that
don't
opt
out,
so
you
still
have
a
fund...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
students
who
opt
out
then
make
a
demand
for
viewpoint-neutral
funds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
a
wobbly.
you...
you
opt
out
and
so
your
funds
aren't
used.
can
they
then
demand
that
the
funds
that
are
used
still
be
used
on
a
viewpoint-neutral
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
like
many
other
universities
throughout
the
country,
the
university
of
wisconsin
requires
its
students
to
pay
a
separate
fee
in
addition
to
tuition.
the
separate
fee
is
called
the
student
activities
fee
and
for
the
years
in
question
here
it
was
$331
a
year.
a
portion
of
the
fee
is
used
by
various
student
organizations,
some
of
which
promote
causes
and
ideas
objectionable
to
other
students.
the
objecting
students
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
around
the
country
have
claimed
that
this
forced
payment
to
support
objectionable
causes
and
ideas
is
a
violation
of
their
free
speech
and
free
association
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
to
address
the
question.
at
the
madison
campus
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
--
again
this
is
typical
to
many
other
universities
--
student
groups
displayed
posters
and
circulate
newsletters,
they
host
campus
debates,
guest
speakers
and
they
engage
in
what
is
best
described
as
political
lobbying.
the
university’s
position
is
that
the
activity
fee
program
stimulates
advocacy
and
debate
from
diverse
points
of
view
and
provides
students
with
opportunities
to
develop
their
skills
all
consistent
with
the
university’s
mission.
the
parties
have
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
process
for
allocating
the
fees
is
administered
in
a
viewpoint
neutral
manner.
the
respondents
each
of
whom
attended
or
still
attend
the
university’s
madison
campus,
filed
suit
against
the
university’s
board
of
regents
alleging
the
first
amendment
violation.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
objecting
students.
it
declared
the
fee
program
invalid
under
our
decisions
in
abood
versus
detroit
board
of
education
and
keller
versus
state
bar
of
california.
those
were
cases
involving
union
dues
or
bar
association
fees,
which
were
used
in
part
to
promote
causes
to
which
the
union
members
or
the
bar
members
objected.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
it
concluded
that
the
program
was
not
germane
to
the
university’s
mission,
it
did
not
further
a
vital
policy
of
the
university
and
it
imposed
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
free
speech
rights
of
the
objecting
students.
we
now
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
university
exacts
the
fees
to
facilitate
the
free
and
open
exchange
of
ideas
among
its
students,
since
the
university
conditions
the
opportunity
to
receive
a
college
education,
an
opportunity
comparable
in
importance
to
joining
a
labor
union
or
a
bar
association.
since
it
conditions
the
opportunity
to
receive
that
education
on
payment
of
fees
to
support
objectionable
extracurricular
expression
by
other
students.
the
first
amendment
rights
acknowledged
in
abood
and
keller
due
we
find
become
implicated.
now,
in
those
cases
the
constitutional
rule
limited
the
required
subsidy
to
speech
germane
to
the
purpose
of
the
union
or
the
bar
association.
the
standard
of
germane
speech
as
applied
to
student’s
speech
of
the
university
is
unworkable
however.
it
gives
insufficient
protection
both
to
the
objecting
students
and
to
the
university
program
itself.
if
as
our
president
have
illustrated
it
is
difficult
to
germane
speech
with
ease
or
precision
where
union
or
a
bar
association
is
the
party,
the
standard
becomes
all
the
more
unmanageable
in
the
public
university
setting,
particularly
where
the
state
undertakes
to
stimulate
the
whole
universe
of
speech
and
ideas.
since
the
standard
of
germane
speech
is
inapplicable,
it
might
be
argued
the
remedy
is
to
allow
each
student
to
list
those
causes
which
he
or
she
will
or
will
not
support
more
or
less
of
the
check
off
system.
if
a
university
decided
that
its
students’
first
amendment
interests
were
best
protected
by
this
type
of
system
it
would
be
free
to
adopt
it.
we
decline
to
impose
the
system
as
a
constitutional
requirement
however.
the
proper
means
by
which
the
university
can
protect
its
students’
first
amendment
rights,
we
conclude
as
the
requirement
of
viewpoint
neutrality
in
the
allocation
of
funding
support.
viewpoint
neutrality
is
the
obligation
to
which
we
gave
substance
in
the
earlier
decision
of
rosenberger
versus
university
of
virginia.
there
we
held
that
a
public
university
would
not
offend
the
establishment
clause,
if
it
adhere
to
viewpoint
neutrality
and
funding
student
associations
including
those
advancing
religious
messages.
there
is
symmetry
in
our
hoarding
here
and
in
rosenberger,
viewpoint
neutrality
permits
the
university
to
require
the
students
to
pay
the
fee
in
first
instance
and
ensures
the
integrity
of
the
program
operation
once
the
funds
have
been
collected.
because
the
parties
have
stipulated
the
university’s
program
respects
the
principle
of
viewpoint
neutrality,
the
program
in
its
basic
structure
must
be
found
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
there
is
one
other
aspect
of
the
university’s
program
at
issue
in
the
case
funding
by
student
referendum
although
not
well
developed
on
the
record
before
us.
it
is
unclear
to
us
what
protection
if
any
there
is
for
a
viewpoint
neutrality
in
the
student
referendum
dimension
of
the
university’s
program
to
the
extent
the
referendum
substitutes
majority
determinations
for
a
viewpoint
neutrality,
it
would
undermine
the
constitutional
protection,
the
program
requires.
the
remand
is
necessary
to
resolve
this
point.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
stevens
and
breyer
have
joined.
