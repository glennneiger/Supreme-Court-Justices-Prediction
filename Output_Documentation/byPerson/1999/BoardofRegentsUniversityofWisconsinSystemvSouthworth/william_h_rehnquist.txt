we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
98-1189,
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
system
v.
scott
harold
southworth.
ms.
ullman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
against
the
guidelines,
i
take
it.
if
it
were
determined
that
a
request
for
something
was
politically
partisan,
it
would
be
turned
down?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that
even
though
partisan
political
activity
is
not
to
be
funded
by...
lobbying
activities,
lobbying
in
the
legislature
is...
may
be.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
suppose
funds
could
be
given
to
an
organization
generally
that
engages
in
lobbying,
and
the...
the
organization
could
say,
well,
we
get
our
lobbying
money
from
somewhere
else.
but
then
the
student
funds
would
simply
supply
other
expenses
of
that
organization.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
ullman,
i'm
curious
to
know...
we've
talked
about
having
speakers
come
to
campus
and
the...
the
forum
analogy
generally.
but
i
got
the
impression
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
number
of
these
funded
groups
don't
purport
to
put
up
speakers
and
invite
everybody
to
come.
they
simply
go
about
their...
their
business,
whatever
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
just...
i
was
just
curious
factually,
you
know,
whether
or
not
it
supports
a
forum
analogy.
aren't
there
some
of
these
groups
who
do
not
have
big
meetings
on
campus
and
invite
speakers,
but
simply
go
about
the
work
they're
supposed
to
go
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
sure
how
they
want
to,
but
what...
what
formal
steps
do
they
take
to
go
ahead
with
this,
i
mean,
other
than
just,
you
know,
grab
somebody
while
they're
walking
between
classes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
does...
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
you
called
it
a
service
organization,
and
yet
it's
just
interested
in
propagating
its
views.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
does
do
a
good
deal
of
propagating
of
its
views
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
service
is
just
a
great,
huge
mother
hubbard
type
of
blanket.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
is...
i
mean,
if...
if
that
is
the
service,
then
presumably
all
sorts
of
organizations
that
may
have
quite
partisan
views
and
spend
their
time
trying
to
persuade
students
of
their...
of
their
merit
are
all
engaged
in
services
to
the
students.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
was,
by
no
means,
all
that
that
organization
did,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
ullman.
mr.
lorence,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lorence.
ms.
ullman,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
ullman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1189,
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
versus
southworth
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
