mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
each
one
of
the
three
parts
of
the
university's
funding
system,
the
referendum,
the
services
that
are
funded
under
gssf,
and
the
asm
system,
the
same
constitutional
principle
applies.
the
university
violates
the...
the
principle
against
compelled
funding
of
political
and
ideological
speech
laid
out
in
abood
and
keller.
with
the
referendum
system,
we
do
not
even
have
a
rosenberger
issue
at
all
because
it
arguably
cannot
be
a
forum
at
all.
rosenberger
is
relevant
to
the
gssf
services
aspect
and
the
asm,
but
in
both
cases
they
are
mainly...
the
main
part
of
both
of
those
is
to
fund
the
political
and
ideological
activities
and
advocacy
of
these
groups.
services...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
right.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
it...
it
does
not.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
you
have
sufficient...
justice
breyer,
sufficient
things
in
the
record
to
see
that
these
groups
that
are
funded
by
the
referendum,
wispirg,
engage
in
very
obvious
political
and
ideological
speech.
the
students
are
compelled
to
fund
it.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
it's
an
easier
case.
i
think
it's
more
straightforward.
i
think
it's
an
obvious
issue
of
compelled
speech,
and
i
think
this
court
could
easily
separate
that
out
and
say
the
other
ones
may
be
a
closer
call
because
of
a
rosenberger
issue,
but
the...
the
referendum
is
definitely
way
over
the
compelled
speech
line
of
abood
and
keller.
and
i
think
that
you
could
handle
it
that
way.
now,
the
other
one...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
claim...
challenge
that
could
be
brought
if
it
was
funded
by
taxation...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
if
it's...
if
it's
tuition
money,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
it's
done.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
that
then
it
would
mean
there's
no
government...
they're
not
agents
of
the
government.
they
don't
come
under
the
government
speech
doctrine.
they're
not
part
of
the
university
program.
even
though
they're
being
paid
by
tuition,
it's
basically
they're
giving
them
money
and
say,
do
what
you
want,
promote...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
your
own
agenda.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
it...
justice
stevens,
it
would
depend
on
how
they
do
it.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
that
we
could
because...
but
it
would
be
a...
it
would
be
shifting
tuition
to
pay
for
a
group
in
a
way
that
they...
they
have
not
used
tuition
ever
before.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
if
they're
going
to
make
these
groups
agents
of
the
university,
then...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
then
i
think
there
would
still
be
a
challenge
because
they...
they
would
be
giving
government...
they
would
be
giving
private
money
to
private
groups
to
do
their...
that
are
independent
of
the
university
to
pursue
their
own
political
and
ideological...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
i
think
that
the...
the
government
speech
doctrine
i
think
provides
a
line
here
that
maybe
this
is...
i'm
trying
to
discern
what
you
might
be
getting
at
here...
that...
if
we're
talking
about
things
that
the
university
is
funding
with
its
academic
program
with
tuition
where
it
says,
this
is
the
university
of
wisconsin,
these
are
our
agents,
that
type
of
thing,
i
think
that
would
be
a
government
speech
issue.
there
would
be
no
challenge
to
that.
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
right
to
opt
out
of
funding
something
like
that.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
that
that...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that
would
be
acceptable
because,
from
what
i
understand,
it
would
be
part
of
the
government...
it
would
be
the
university
of
wisconsin
extending
its
agency
or
sponsorship
or
something
over
that
event.
and
i
don't
think
there
could
be
a
challenge.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
some
of
these
issues
in
the
middle,
i'm
not
exactly
sure.
the
facts
would
have
to
be
specific,
but
i
think
the
issue...
where
the
line
would
be
drawn,
as
it
was
in
rosenberger
and
rust,
is,
is
this
a
government
speech,
is
this
a
government
actor
with
the
authority
or
the
sponsorship,
agency
of
the
university...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
because
there
is...
it's
clear
from
the...
the
student
operations
handbook,
which
is
in
the
record.
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix...
that
the...
the
registered
student
organizations
are
distinct,
separate,
independent,
private,
that
they...
they
are...
they're
talked
about
how
they
are
not
university
actors.
in
fact,
they
could
not
be
sued...
the
university
could
not
be
sued
to
say
one
of
your
groups
did
something
wrong.
they're
clearly
separate
from
the
government
here,
from
the
university.
so,
the...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
correct.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
i...
i
think
that
it
would...
i
think
the
issue
would
be
sponsorship.
is
this
the
university
of
wisconsin
sponsoring
this
event?
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
government
speech...
it
would
be
protected
under
the
government
speech
doctrine.
if
it's,
well,
we're
kind
of
inviting
you
in
an
informal
way,
but
the
sponsorship
is
with
the
private
organization,
then
i
think
it
would
be
private
speech
still.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
as...
as
i
understand
the
government
speech
doctrine
from
rust...
and
it
was
discussed
somewhat
in
rosenberger...
that
the...
that
there's
no
claim
to
challenge
the
government's
own
speech
or
when
the
government
designates
agents...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
to
be
their
speakers.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
so,
if
there's
an
invitation
by
the
university
for
someone
off
campus
to
come
on
and
speak,
maybe
the...
the
speaker
is
controversial...
i
think
the...
and
i
think
the
issue
would
be
is
this...
is
there
some
sort
of
sponsorship.
is
this
the
government...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
justice
souter,
what
you
said
i
think
is
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
i
think
to...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
to
capsulize
it
in
one
word,
i'm
having
some
difficulty
doing
that.
but
what
you're
saying
i
think
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
justice
scalia,
what
you're
saying
is...
is
definitely
the
application
of
how
the
doctrine
has
been
done
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
but
i
think
that
it
would
also
be
within
the
parameters
of
that
doctrine
to
say
that
the
university
can
operate
a
system
where
it
has
speakers,
professors,
outsiders
that
come
in
and
speak
views,
and
the
university
can
protect
them
in
a
sense
from
a
case
like
this...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i...
i
think
that
i'm
not
talking
about
mere
labels.
i'm
thinking
about
the
reality
of
what's
going
on,
of
the
situation.
if
it's
basically
the
university
or
the
government
pulling
the
strings,
operating
it,
then
i
think
it
comes
under
the
government
speech
doctrine.
and
this...
that's
a
limitation,
i
think,
on
the...
the
cause
of
action...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes,
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
i
think...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
that
the...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
the...
the
point
of
this
is
so
that
the
government...
the
university
can
have
a
state
university
system
if
it
wants.
the
difference
here,
under
abood
and
keller,
is
that
people
cannot
be
compelled
to
fund
private
speech
of
independent
entities
which
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
tuition
itself
does
not
answer
the
question,
that
it's
paid
by
tuition.
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
it
has
to
be...
is
there
some
level
of
university
control
over
this
because
the
university
said
in
its
brief
that
it
uses
tuition
money
to
pay
for
the
instructional
program
of
the
university.
so,
i
think
if
it
was
paying
for
these
groups
with
tuition
money,
it
would
transform
them
into
agents
of
the
university.
they
would
be
part
of
the
instructional
program,
which
i
think
most
of
these
groups
would
object
to.
they
want
their
independence.
they
want
to
be
able
to
freely
lobby
at
the
wisconsin
legislature
on
their
issues.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
the...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
the
university
as
a
state
actor
may
have
an
educational
mission
that's
broad,
but
it
still
has
a
constitutional...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i...
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
i
can
give
a
straight
answer
in
that
it
would
depend
on
exactly
how
they're
doing
it.
i
think...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
if
they're
doing
it
the
same
way
they're
doing
it
now
with
tuition
money,
i
still
think
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
because
the
groups
would
be
independent
of
the
university.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well...
well,
it's...
it's
because
they're
funding
the
speech
of
these
organizations
as
opposed
to
some
sort
of
conduit
for
it,
that
the
speech
is
converted
into
the
speech
of...
the
message
of
these
groups.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
exactly
right,
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
right.
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
right.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
justice
breyer,
because
the
students
have
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
speak.
so,
to
fund
some
voices
that
they
agree
with
or
don't
care
about
and
some
that
they
disagree
with,
i
still
think
violates
the...
the
principle.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
wide-range
debate
will
not
disappear
or
be
significantly
diminished
by
allowing
objecting
students
to
opt
out.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
no,
no.
[laughter]
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i...
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
on
this
matter
that
at
the
joint
appendix
300,
the
university
states
that
the
mandatory
fee
system
is
not
the...
the
primary
way
that
groups
are
funded.
the
primary
sources
of
funding
for
most
student
organizations
are
membership
dues
and
other
fund
raising
ideas.
this
is
from
the
student
handbook
that's
distributed
to
all
the
student
organizations.
it's
at
page
300
of
the
joint
appendix.
so,
even
the
university
doesn't
view
the
mandatory
fee
system
as
essential
or
critical
to
the
existence
of
this.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
no.
in
fact,
from
what
we
can
tell,
it's...
it's...
it
may
have
started
at
the
beginning
of
the
university,
but
the
funding
of
these
kinds
of
groups
can
only
be
traced
back
to
the
vietnam
war
era
from
the
wisconsin
attorney
general
opinions
and
stuff
like
this.
so,
this
is
a
very
recent
innovation
to
fund
these
kind
of
ideological
advocacy
groups
on
campus.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
a
couple
of
things.
i
think
in
abood
and
keller,
justice
souter,
that
if
the
union
or
the
bar
association
had
been
funding
multiple
candidates
or
differing
points
of
view
to...
to
kind
of
be
more
inclusive
or
something
like
that,
this
problem
still
would
remain,
that
there...
there
would
still
be
a
violation
there.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
correct.
it's...
it's...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
your...
you
have
a
constitutional
right,
justice
scalia,
to
just
stand
back
and
say,
i'm
going
to
not
enter
into
this
debate,
and
i'm
not
going
to
fund
a
position
in
this
debate...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that
i
don't
agree
with.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
they're
promoting
the
message
of
the
organizations.
maybe
they're
not
being
identified,
that
scott
southworth
supports
the
views
of
the
socialist
organization,
but
they're
definitely...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
in...
in
light
of
rosenberger,
that
the
university
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint,
which
means
that
students...
it
would
be
impermissible
for
students
to
lobby
the
student
government
or
the
university
and
say,
cut
off
funding
to
the...
the
x
group
because
we
don't
agree
with
them.
they
have
to
be
funded
on
a
viewpoint-neutral
basis.
i
think
that
the
only...
that
rosenberger
points
to
a
abood/
keller
type
solution
here
so
that
dissenters
who
object
to
these
groups
have
a
way
to
protect
their
right
of
conscience.
if...
if
we
don't
do
that,
then
that
means,
as
was
brought
up
earlier,
the
african
american
students
can
be
compelled
to
support
the
kkk,
the
jewish
students
can
be
compelled
to
support
a
group
that
wants
to
put
israel...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
your
honor,
that...
let
me
try
this,
justice
souter,
that
if
there's
a
campus
auditorium
and
a
group
speaks
there,
at
the
end
of
the
meeting,
the
auditorium
remains,
it's
under
university
control,
and
the
group
goes
home.
under
this
system,
if
this
is
a
forum
of
money,
the
money
is
given
over
to
the
group
and
is
converted
into
their
message.
the
money
becomes
the
speech...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
i...
i
think
there's
more
to
it
than
that,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
just
not
that
we've
got
some
wear
and
tear
on
an
auditorium
when
a
group
uses
it.
i
think
that
when
you're
giving
money
to
them,
you're
funding
the...
what
they're...
what
they're
given
money
for
is
to
fund
their
overhead
expenses,
to...
underwrites
their
whole
basic
mission
of
what
they're
pushing
here.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
your...
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
there's
still
direct
funding
here,
that...
i
don't
think,
for
example,
the
union
in
abood
could
have
said,
we're
funding
both
the
republican
and
the
democratic
candidates
because
we
think
it
would
enhance
the
electoral
process
to
have
both
voices...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
right.
[laughter]
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
they
couldn't
somehow
disassociate
themselves
and
say,
these
objecting
union
members
in
abood,
they
have
nothing
to
complain
about.
they
agree
with
one
side
or
the
other.
so,
we've
somehow
put
enough
buffer
between
here
that
we
can...
that
there's
no
first
amendment
claim.
i
just
don't
want
to
compound
the
problem.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
well,
and
i
would
say
that
the
university
as
a
state
actor
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
respect
the...
the
right
of
conscience
of
the
students.
their
education
mission
must
be
subordinate
to
that,
that...
they...
they
cannot
view
the
students'
right
of
conscience
as
some
sort
of
roadblock
between
education...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
right.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
your
honor,
let
me
just
speak...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
about
three
hypos
in
one
here,
your
honor,
that...
justice
stevens,
that...
i
would
say
it
this
way.
there's
no
abood
complaint
against
non-speech
activities.
so,
i
think
the
athletic
stuff
would
be
fine.
if...
if
there's...
there's
no...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
right.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
the
abood
case...
there's
no
abood
claim
for
government
speech.
the
newspapers
may
fall
into
that,
the
student
newspapers,
if
it's
the
official
university
one.
we
don't
have
that
case
here,
and
i...
i
know
that
all
the
lower
courts
have
resolved
it
the
other
way.
and
the
third
thing...
i
don't
recall,
justice
stevens...
was?
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
i
think
that
if
there
were...
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
it
because
i
think
there's
a
government
speech
issue.
if
you
have
rosenberger's
newspaper,
i
think
people
could
object
to
funding
its
christian
proselytizing.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes,
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
yes.
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
conclusion,
the
seventh
circuit
correctly
ruled
that
the
university
of
wisconsin's
mandatory
fee
system
violates
the
abood
and
keller
rights
of
the
students.
the
university
may
have
an
educational
mission,
but
it
has
a
greater
first
amendment
duty
to
protect
and
recognize
the
right
of
conscience
of
each
individual
student.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
yes.
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
if
the...
if
the
funds
were...
mr.
jordan
w.
lorence
there
might
be
a
free
rider
question
there,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
