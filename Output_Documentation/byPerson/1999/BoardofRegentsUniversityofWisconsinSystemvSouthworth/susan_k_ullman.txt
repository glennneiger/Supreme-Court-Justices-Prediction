ms.
susan
k.
ullman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
university
of
wisconsin,
like
public
and
private
universities
across
the
country,
has
long
had
and
encouraged
a
wide
range
of
student
activities.
at
the
university
of
wisconsin,
these
activities
are
supported
in
part
by
disbursements
from
a
student
activity
fund
which
is
a
viewpoint-neutral
forum
for
student
groups.
the
first
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
university
of
wisconsin
from
requiring
all
students
to
contribute
to
this
viewpoint-neutral
forum.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
there
are
three
different
funding
schemes.
the
first
is
the
gssf
funding,
which
is
funding
for
organizations
that
provide
services
to
significant
numbers
of
students
at
the
uw-madison.
the
second
is...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
the
funds
are
allocated
by
a
student
group.
all
the
funds
are
in
the
state
treasury
and
are
paid.
they're
not
paid
in
a
lump
sum
to
the
group.
the
group
has
to
fill
out
a
requisition
form,
and
then
the
bill
is
paid
by
the
fund.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
they
are.
they
are
limited
to
services
for
significant
numbers
of
students
in
the
areas,
of
student
health,
student
life
on
campus,
that
sort
of
thing.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes.
there
are
specific
budgets,
and
they...
for
the
service
organizations,
they
are
for...
for
example,
they
can
be
the
bus
service
and
that
passes
to
all
the
students.
one
of
the
groups
they've
challenged
is
the
campus
women's
center.
that
funds
the
physical
place
that
the
forum
is,
as
well
as
the
activities
of
the
center.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
the
ultimate
control,
yes,
but
it
is...
it
is
a
student
group
in
all
three
that
determine
the
funds
and
the
university
provides
a
check...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
in
all
three
categories,
in
theory
the
university
could...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it
is
analogous
to
that
situation,
but
here
it
is
the
students
that
are
choosing
which
groups
will
speak,
and
that
is
very
important...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
because
the
university
itself
is
not
speaking.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
think...
i
think
we
hold
up
under
either
position.
i
think
our
position
this
court
doesn't
need
to
go
as
far
as
the
position
of
some
of
the
amici.
i
think
we
hold
up
under
the
students
determining
where
the
money
shall
go.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
there
is
a
representative
from
the
dean
of
students
office
who
participates
at
the
committee
meetings
and
someone
from
the
dean
of
students
office
who
must
sign
off
on
the
requisitions
for
the
funds.
there
hasn't
been
any
example
in
our
record
of
the
university
turning
down
some
funding
because
it's
politically
partisan.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it
is
against
the
guidelines.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
such
a
group
would
get
funding,
assuming
that
the
group...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
if
it
comes
to
the
forum
and
does
its
application
correctly,
is
compliance...
in
compliance
with
the
rules
of
being
a
registered
student
organization,
doesn't
discriminate,
can
fulfill
those
requirements,
then
it
will
get
funding.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct,
with
the
handful
of
exceptions
of
groups
who
didn't
fill
out
their
applications
properly.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
under
one
policy,
it
says
lobbying
should
be
excluded.
we
haven't
found
anything
in
this
record
that
student
activity
funds
paid
for
lobbying.
there
was
lobbying,
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
funds
paid
for
it.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes.
the
student
funds
generally
went
to
postage
and
printing,
office
supplies,
things
of
that
nature.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
for
the
forum
metaphor.
first
of
all,
in
rosenberger,
this
court
did
recognize
that
a
student
activity
fund
is
a
forum
like
a
park
or
any
other
forum.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct,
and
the
parties
here
on
both
sides
viewed
this
as
a
forum.
and
in
answer
to
your
point
about
the
hundreds
of
groups
that
don't
get
funding,
i
don't
think
that's
actually
an
accurate
representation
of
what's
going
on.
here
we
have
a
snapshot
of
one
year
and
these
125
groups
get
funding,
but
each
year
the
groups
that
get
funding
change.
so,
to
say
70
percent
of
them
don't
get
funding,
that
might
be
true
in
a
different...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't
know
that
the
percent
changes
radically,
but
out
of
the
18
groups
that
the
respondents
objected
to,
2
of
those
were
not
funded
the
next
year.
so,
that's
a
large...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
your
second
statement
is
true,
that
these
groups
are
having
speakers
come
anyway.
certainly
the
vast
bulk
of
the
speech
that's
discussed
in
the
record
is
all
coming
from
these
groups.
it
takes
money
to
invite
a
speaker.
so,
the
groups
that
are
inviting
speakers
to
campus
do
need
some
funding.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
do
have
support
from
the
dean
of
students
who
said
that
it
takes
an
honorarium
or
travel
expenses
to
get
speakers...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
the
university
made
the
judgment
that
it
is
very
important
to
it
to
have
all
of
these
different
groups
funded.
and
the
reason
that
the
forum
analogy
works
is
because
the
students
pay
the
money
into
a
fund,
and
then
all
groups
can
speak.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
that
that's
true,
but
it...
the
forum
is
the
pot
of
money.
it's
not...
i'm
not
claiming
that
each
individual
group
is
holding
a
forum.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
when
i...
in
our
joint
appendix
is
an
excerpt
from
the
funding
application
of
many
of
these
objected-to
organizations,
and
they
all
talk
about
how
they
want
to
educate
other
students
and
what
they'll
do.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
they
do
do
that.
they
use
chalkings.
they
do
poster.
and
they
do
invite
speakers.
they
have
art
exhibits.
they
have
photo
exhibits.
so,
they're
engaging
in
all
sorts
of
types
of...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
all
right.
wispirg
did
voluntarily
have
a
referendum
that
went
to
the
student
body,
and
it
was
voted
that
they
would
get
a
certain
amount
from
each
student's
fees.
wispirg
then
had
to
go
through
the
gssf
funding
process.
it
had
to
fill
out
the
application.
it
had
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
committee
where
they
would
decide
its
funding.
the
committee
voluntarily
views
that
referendum
as
binding,
and
they
use
that
as
a
minimum...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct.
wispirg
is
getting
the
funding
through
the
services.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct.
we
have
funding
of
services
and
we
have
funding
of
all
groups
as
a
forum.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
wispirg
was
funded
through
the
mechanism
for
student...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes.
wispirg
in
its
application
says
that
in
the
past
year
it
has
served
more
than
20,000
people,
75
percent
on
the
campus.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it
says
it's
offered
them
volunteer
and
internship
programs
for
course
credit
and
that
they've
had
at
least
5,000
students
use
their
educational
materials
on
environmental
and
consumer
issues.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
the...
we
have
a
stipulation
as
to
what
the
services
organizations
will
do,
and
the
respondents
haven't
challenged
that
any
particular...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes,
and
that...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
factually
disputed,
whether
they
engaged
in
lobbying.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
right.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
true.
the
case
was
resolved
on
summary
judgment,
and
the
lower
courts
didn't
seem
to
acknowledge
the
separate
funding...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i'm...
i'm
defending
it
as
being
one
of
the
services
organizations
funded
through
the
service
mechanism.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
think
that's
simplifying
too
broadly
what
wispirg
does.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
certainly,
and
it
views...
i
mean,
it
views
its
own
speeches
educating
the
students,
and
that's
part
of...
what
are
faculties
doing
too
with
telling
the
students...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
right.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
sorry.
the
first
is
gssf,
which
is
funding
services,
and
the
second
is
asm,
which
is
the
forum.
that's
the
associated
students
of
madison,
the
student
government.
and
the
third
was
wispirg
that
had
a
referendum
and
then
went
through
gssf.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it
was
for
the
asm
money.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
which
is
the
one
that's
the
forum.
and
it
extended
to
gssf
insofar
as
no
group
was
discriminated
against...
no
group...
there's
no
evidence
a
group
was
denied
funding
for
its
views,
but
they
were
screened
as
to
whether
they
were
service...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
right.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
do
know
that
the
united
states
student
association
lost
its
funding
by
referendum
the
year
after
it
got
funding
in
here.
so,
that
must
be
true.
what
happened
was
they
asked
for
funding
again
and
it
was
voted
down.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it's
an
organization
of
different
student
governments.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
think
the
campus
referendum
for
wispirg
went
through
the
student
services
organization,
and
i
think
funding
services
for
significant
numbers
of
students
is
a
legitimate
function
for
any
university.
and
if
there's
a
problem
with
a
particular
organization
that
got
funding
through
that
mechanism,
that
it's
not
really
a
service
or
something
like
that,
that's
a
specific
challenge
to
a
case.
there's
no
reason
to
throw
out...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
no,
that...
that...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't...
i
don't
really
think
it's
fair
to
say
if
it's
called
a
service.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
right.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
if...
if
it
could
fit
the
criteria
for
being
a
service,
which
we
had
stipulated
to
what
that
includes...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that
it
provides
direct,
ongoing
services
to
significant
numbers
of
uw-madison
students.
the
funds
should
also
contribute
significantly
to
student
health,
safety,
or
academic
success.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
wispirg
was...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
well,
wispirg
was
able
to
show
to
this
organization
that
it
was
providing
a
service.
the
dean
of
students...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
everything
wispirg
is
providing
together
is...
yes...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
no.
wispirg
received
its
funding
and
the
dean
of
students
said
it
has...
wispirg
has
been
especially
effective
in
helping
students
identify
projects
that
fit
with
their
academic
work
in
the
classroom
so
that
students
can
experience
both
the
service
and
learning
around
this
same
topic.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
it...
no,
it
did
a
lot
of
things.
that's
for
sure.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't
think
the
student
referendum
could
just
knock
out
any
group,
but
that
is
not
clear
in
our
record.
our...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
all
the
student
groups
are
getting
funding
through
the
asm.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't
know.
the...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
guess
in
theory
it
could.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
right.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
well,
the...
the
important
mechanism
that's
getting
funding
here
is
this
forum.
it
wouldn't
be
practical
for
groups
that
are
getting
just
very
small
amounts
to
go
try
to
set
up
this
referendum
process.
it
would
cost
them
more
to
do
that
than
they
are
getting
in
this
funding.
hundred...
more
than
a
hundred
groups
are
getting
funding
from
the
forum,
and
they
express
all
different
views.
and
the
university
wants
those
minority
groups
to
be...
or
unpopular
groups
to
be
able
to
speak
too.
and
that's...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
no.
that
is
the
associated
students
of
madison
forum
funding.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i...
i
don't
think
it
needed
to
be
a
service.
it
was
part
of
the
forum
in
that
case,
and
in
this
case
the
125
student
groups
are
part
of...
the
vast
bulk
of
the
groups
that
are
funded
are
through
the
forum.
they
aren't
funded
through
this
service
organization.
if
i
could
reserve
some
time.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
the...
there
are
two
policies.
one
is
for
the
gssf
student
funding,
that
mechanism,
and
it
says
the
organization
does
not
have
a
primarily
political
orientation,
i.e.,
it
is
not
a
registered
political
group,
and
shall
not
use
sufac
funds
for
any
lobbying
purposes.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
using
the
funding
for
those
purposes.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
the
university
has
traditionally
excluded
partisan
political
and
religious
activities.
after
rosenberger,
its
policy...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
only
partisan
political
speech.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
and
that...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
because
the
university
wants
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
political
favoritism.
the
wisconsin
legislature
provides
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
the
university
each
year.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
that's
right.
it
wants
to
confine
the
forum
to
the
purposes
that
it
defined
it
for.
in
rosenberger,
they
also
excluded
political
activities
of
electioneering
and
lobbying.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't
think
it
harms
the
forum
analysis.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
no.
it
only
excludes
a
very
narrow
band
of
partisan
political.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes,
but
there's
still
at
this
forum
a
wide
range
of
speech
that
can
be
heard.
and
the...
this
court
has
recognized
that
you
can
exclude
a
class
of
speech
in
cornelius
v.
the
naacp.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i
don't
think
so.
that
sounds
like
it
would
be
viewpoint-based
rather
than...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
no.
we're
excluding
an
entire
class
of
speech,
an
entire
category.
we're
not
excluding
a
particular
viewpoint.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
i...
i
think
the...
the
university
has
limited
the
partisan
political.
the
respondents
haven't
challenged
that
category
of
funding.
they've
challenged
the
funding
mechanism.
if
there's
a
problem
with
excluding
partisan
political,
then
that's
a
rosenberger
type
case
that
isn't
here.
thank
you.
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
setting
aside
wispirg,
the
other
groups
that
were
funded
through
gss
were
services
and
there's
no
claim
that
there
was
any
viewpoint
discrimination
there.
the
university
of
wisconsin...
ms.
susan
k.
ullman
yes.
the
university
of
wisconsin
has
determined
that
it
is
important
to
facilitate
the
speech
of
diverse
groups,
that
this
furthers
the
university's
educational
mission
and
first
amendment
values.
thank
you.
