mr.
deano,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
or
two
about
this
so-called
class
of
one.
was
it
really
a
class
of
one,
or
were
there
five
people
or
so
involved
in
the
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
well,
it
wasn't
in
fact
a
class
of
one,
and
when
has
this
court
ever
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
only
addresses
classes
as
opposed
to
individuals?
have
we
ever
said
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
should
we?
i
mean,
if
the
city
wants
to
single
out
one
citizen
for
some
irrational
action,
why
isn't
that
citizen
protected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
even
understand
the
vindictiveness
point.
i
mean,
if
the
city
says
to
ms.
olech,
we
won't
hook
you
up
to
city
water
unless
you
give
us
50
feet
of
land
for
a
street,
and
every
other
person
in
the
city,
they
say,
fine,
we'll
hook
you
up,
give
us
5
feet,
but
to
her
they
say
50
feet,
now,
what
does
vindictiveness
have
to
do
with
it
at
all?
i
mean,
is
there
no
equal
protection
claim
for
ms.
olech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
isn't
there
a
claim?
you
treated
me
differently.
you
required
50
feet
from
me
and
10
feet
from
every
other
person
in
the
city.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
reason
was.
don't
you
have
to
treat
citizens
equally
when
hooking
them
up
to
city
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
also
seems
that
this
was,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
dismissed
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
i
mean,
normally
you
wouldn't
make
that
motion.
you'd
file
an
answer,
and
then
there
would
be
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
you
can
look
at
it.
i
don't
know
why
the
village
of
willowbrook
took
this
unusual
route
and
thought
they
had
a
right
to
dismiss
the
complaint
rather
than
file
an
answer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
the
complaint
boils
down
to,
they
treated
me
differently
than
every
other
citizen
when
it
comes
to
hooking
up
water,
that's
enough,
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
one
person
or
five
person...
five
people.
now,
go
file
your
answer,
you
know.
we've
answered
the
question,
go
file
an
answer.
i
mean,
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
have
to
get
beyond
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
to
reach
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
le
sage
was
hardly
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wimmer,
did
you
represent
ms.
olech...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
all
times
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
drafted
the
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
if
a
complaint
were
to
allege
that
the
city
took
some...
singled
out
the
plaintiff
for
some
negative
action
solely
because
the
city
didn't
like
the
person
for
some
reason,
the
mayor
hated
her,
and
it
turns
out,
though,
that
there
is
a
perfectly
rational
basis
that
the
court
can
think
of
for
the
mayor's
action,
is
there
a
lawsuit
just
because
the
mayor,
in
his
heart
of
hearts,
hated
the
plaintiff
and
wanted
that
outcome,
even
though
we
can
derive
a
perfectly
rational
basis?
