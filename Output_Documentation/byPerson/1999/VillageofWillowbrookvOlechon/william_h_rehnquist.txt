chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-1288,
the
village
of
willowbrook
v.
grace
olech.
mr.
deano.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
deano,
supposing
that
in
this
case
they
asked
50
feet
of
mrs.
olech's
property
and
asked
only
10
feet
from
people
whose
property
was
indistinguishable
from
mrs.
olech,
do
you
say
that
that
would
not
be
any
sort
of
an
equal
protection
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing...
again,
let's
have
the
50-foot
and
10-foot
examples,
that
from
mrs.
olech
they
want
50
feet,
from
people
identically
situated
they
want
10
feet,
and
it
simply
is
a
result
of
a
goof
in
the
city
clerk's
office.
no
one
had
it
in
for
mrs.
olech,
but
nonetheless
that's
the
way
it
comes
out.
does
the
fact
that
it
was
a
mistake
rather
than
a
conscious
thing
make
the
equal
protection
claim
disappear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
don't
know
that
from
the
motion
to...
from
the
complaint
and
the
motion
to
dismiss,
do
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
all
the
facts
necessary
to
support
your
argument
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
can
be
deduced
from
the
complaint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
know,
we
don't
necessarily
follow
a
case
from
the
seventh
circuit.
perhaps
we
wouldn't
hear.
but
if
there's
enough
in
the
complaint
to
support
a
traditional
equal
protection
claim,
we
wouldn't
have
to
get
into
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
one
doesn't
need
to
find
vindictiveness
in
order
to
say
that
a
complaint
like
the
states
have
claimed
for
relief
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
seems
to
me
we
wouldn't
get
into
the
esmail
question
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
deano.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
decide
that
you're
going
to
treat
this
person
differently
because
they've
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
village,
but
it
turns
out
there's
a
perfectly
rational
basis
for
treating
them
differently?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
under
the
doyle
approach,
my
hypothetical,
would
a
court
say,
yes,
this
is
a
prima
facie
denial
of
equal
protection
because
of
50
feet
versus
10
feet,
and
the
respondent
has
come
up
with
a
perfectly
good
explanation
of
why,
but
we
also
find
that
the
motive
for
doing
it
was
not
the
rational
basis,
that
they
simply
wanted
to
get
this
person
because
they
filed
a
lawsuit,
and
kind
of
dug
up
the
rational
basis
later.
then
what
happens
under
doyle?
we
would
have
done
it
anyway,
so...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
you
would
propose
to
conceive
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
wimmer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
discussion
of
question
1
may
involve
some...
you
know,
rather
than
a
purely
hypothetical
discussion
might
involve
discussion
of
question
2.
that's
not
to
say
question
2
is
before
the
court,
but
i
don't
know
that
you
can
totally
separate
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
had
a
somewhat
different
situation
here,
where
we're
not
talking
about
the
demand
for
easement
dedication,
but
whether
the
village
is
going
to
contract
with
a
particular
person,
or
take
bids
from
various
persons
to
do
the
paving
in
this
area,
and
the
village
says,
well,
one
person
we're
not
going
to
contract
with
is
x,
because
x
has
a
reputation
for
suing
everybody,
for
just
being
a
very
litigious
person
constantly
taking
advantage
of
his
right
to
petition.
is
that
impermissible
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
does
protect
someone
who
the
county
or
the
village
simply
doesn't
want
to
deal
with
because
they
have
a
propensity
to
litigate
at
the
drop
of
a
hat.
sometimes
they
win,
sometimes
they
lose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wimmer.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
98-1288
the
village
of
willowbrook
v.
grace
olech.
in
this
case
olech
sued
the
petitioner,
the
village
of
willowbrook
alleging
that
the
village
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
demanding
a
33-foot
easement
from
her
before
connecting
her
property
to
the
municipal
water
supply
instead
of
the
15-foot
easement
required
from
other
property
owners.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
for
failing
to
state
an
equal
protection
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm.
our
cases
have
recognized
that
a
plaintiff
raises
valid
equal
protection
claim,
when
she
alleges
that
she
has
been
intentionally
treated
differently
from
others
in
the
similar
situation,
and
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
difference
in
treatment.
olech’s
complaint
alleged
that
the
village
intentionally
demanded
an
excessive
easement
from
her
and
that
the
village’s
demand
was
irrational
and
wholly
arbitrary.
this
is
sufficient
to
state
a
claim
for
relief
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
