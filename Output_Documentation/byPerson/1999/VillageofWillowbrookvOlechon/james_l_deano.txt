mr.
james
l.
deano
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
one
where
that
claimant
does
not
allege
membership
in
any
class
or
group,
but
asserts
that
vindictiveness
motivated
the
government
to
treat
her
differently
than
others
similarly
situated.
mr.
james
l.
deano
i
think
the
facts
of
the
complaint
could
give
rise
to
a
class
of
five.
however,
the
cause
of
action
was
brought
under
this
vindictive
action,...
class-of-one
type
of
equal
protection
claim,
so
i
know
that
there's
an
argument
in
this
case
that
there
is...
mr.
james
l.
deano
the
case
that
we
cite...
no,
not
directly,
this
court
has
not
said
that.
mr.
james
l.
deano
the
citizen
is
protected
if
that
class
is
drawn
for
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason,
and
we
submit
that
vindictiveness
is
not
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason,
and
really
what
it's
looking
into
is
the
distinction
between...
mr.
james
l.
deano
we
submit
that
if
there
is
an
equal
protection
claim,
it
is
not
under
this
esmail-type
theory,
and
then...
mr.
james
l.
deano
if
the
reason
that
they
sought
the
additional
50
feet
in
your
example
was
constitutionally
impermissible,
to
punish...
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
i
would
look
at
this
court's
case
of
snowden
v.
hughes,
where
the
court
said
that
simply
differential
treatment,
even
if
it
violates
state
law,
and
in
this
case
village
policy,
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
unless
it
is
done
for
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason.
now...
mr.
james
l.
deano
if
it
was
done
for
an
impermissible,
constitutionally
impermissible...
mr.
james
l.
deano
justice
scalia,
i
would
point
to
the
snowden
case
where
the
court
said,
simply
differential
treatment
is
not
a
violation
of...
mr.
james
l.
deano
and...
mr.
james
l.
deano
and
that's
what
we're
arguing
in
this
case,
that...
mr.
james
l.
deano
well...
[laughter]
if...
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
if
the
rational
basis
is
to
serve
a
legitimate
government
objective,
for
example,
in
this
instance
to
upgrade
and
improve
an
existing
road,
then
we
submit
that
the
question
should
be,
if
it's
an
equal
protection
claim
it
should
fall
under
traditional
equal
protection
analysis,
with
the...
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
i
think
as
the
district
court
found,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
reason
that
the
village
sought
the
additional,
and
i
think
it's
in
this
case
18
feet,
was
so
that
it
could
improve
and
dedicate
this
road.
mr.
james
l.
deano
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
reason
they
sought
the
additional
space
was
so
that
they
could,
i
believe,
pave
and
complete
the
road
with
sidewalks
and
public
utilities,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
a
legitimate
purpose.
we
submit
that
if
these
facts
give
rise
to
an
equal
protection
claim...
mr.
james
l.
deano
yes.
it's
at
page
8
and
9
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
actually
starts
at
page
3
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
james
l.
deano
at
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it's
allegation
number
25,
where
it's
alleged
that
they
sought
the
property
so
that
they
could
dedicate
the
public
roadway
and
construct
pavement,
public
utilities...
mr.
james
l.
deano
okay.
our
position
is
not
that
no
single
individual
can
ever
state
an
equal
protection
claim
when
they've
been
singled
out
for
improper
treatment.
our
point
is
that
the
esmail
doctrine
coming
from
the
seventh
circuit
essentially
says
that
what
we
look
to
first
is
the
government's
motive,
and
our
position
is
that
motive
need
not
be
delved
into
if
the
ultimate
objective
or
purpose
is
legitimate.
mr.
james
l.
deano
yes.
under
snowden
i
agree
that
if
it's
a...
the
phrase
used
in
snowden,
if
it
is
purposeful
and
intentional
discrimination,
i
think
that
looks
into
whether
they've
been
singled
out
for
reasons
that
the
constitution
has
found
to
be
admissible.
mr.
james
l.
deano
i
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
commit
an
equal
protection
violation
through
error,
omission,
mistake.
i
think
there
has
to
be,
under
snowden,
an
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination.
mr.
james
l.
deano
intent
versus
motive,
if
the
intent
is
to
take
50
feet,
then
certainly
they
treated
her
differently
than
others...
mr.
james
l.
deano
when
they
took
less
than
50
feet
from
them.
mr.
james
l.
deano
however...
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
that
may
state
a
traditional
equal
protection
claim,
but
then
the
question
for
the
court
would
be,
is
there
a
rational
basis
for
this,
and
we
submit
that
this
complaint
alleges
a
rational
basis
for
why
they
asked
for
an
additional
18
feet
in
this
case.
mr.
james
l.
deano
establishing
roads
and
also
for
the
purpose...
mr.
james
l.
deano
the
differential
treatment
is
the
beginning
of
the
analysis.
once
you
find
the
differential
treatment,
i
think
then
you
look
to
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
for
that.
mr.
james
l.
deano
that...
mr.
james
l.
deano
no.
that
situation
may
give
rise
to
an
equal
protection
claim.
however,
then
the
question
would
be
whether
the
court
can
find
a
conceivable
rational
basis
for
why
the
government
asked
for
10
feet
in
one
instance,
25
feet
in
another.
mr.
james
l.
deano
yes.
mr.
james
l.
deano
the
complaint
alleges
those
facts.
mr.
james
l.
deano
under
the
esmail
theory,
where
is...
where
the
court
says
to
look
at
motive
before
you
look
at
anything
else,
that's
what
we're
saying,
that
that
may
be
a
traditional
equal
protection
claim.
mr.
james
l.
deano
well...
mr.
james
l.
deano
not
whether
simply
one
person
can
ever
state
an
equal
protection
claim,
but
whether
that
one
person
can
state
that
they
were
singled
out
because
of
the
government's
motive,
vindictiveness.
mr.
james
l.
deano
well...
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
in
answer
to
that
question,
i
think
that...
mr.
james
l.
deano
and
under
traditional
equal
protection
analysis,
the
question
then
would
be
for
the
court
to
search
the
record
to
see
if
there
is
any
conceivable
rational
basis.
mr.
james
l.
deano
the...
we
submit
that
the
rational
basis
is
that
in
this
instance
they
had
a
nondedicated
road
over
which
they
were
now
being
asked
to
place
a
public
improvement.
mr.
james
l.
deano
no...
[laughter]
mr.
james
l.
deano
no,
it's
not
that
if
hatred
is
baseless,
it's
if
the
act,
the
legitimate...
the
goal
of
the
government.
in
this
instance,
we
submit
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
was
legitimate.
whether
their
motive,
then,
was
improper
should
not
be
relevant
under...
mr.
james
l.
deano
on
that
set
of
facts,
if
they
alleged
a
traditional
equal
protection
claim,
the
next
question
would
be,
is
there
a
conceivable
rational
basis
for
what
was
done,
and
that's
why
we
point,
and
why
the
district
court
pointed
to
paragraph
25,
which
alleged
that
although
the
respondent
is
saying
the
reason
they
did
this
is
because
they're
retaliating
against
me,
they
also
supplied
an
allegation
that
explained
another
basis,
another
reason
why
the
village
wanted
that
18
feet.
mr.
james
l.
deano
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
reason...
if
nobody
else
was
asked
for
33
feet,
that
would
create
the
classification.
but
once
the
classification
is
created,
then
the
question
becomes,
what
was
the
legitimate
government
purpose?
was
there
a
conceivable
rational
basis?
so
that's
where
we
think
paragraph
25
is...
mr.
james
l.
deano
i
agree
with
that,
and
the
reason
that
she
was
asked
for
the
33
feet
is
why
she
was
treated
differently.
mr.
james
l.
deano
this
is
a
unique
situ...
no,
because
in
this
situation
we
had
a
nondedicated
road.
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
the
complaint
alleges
that
it
had
never
been
dedicated,
and
that
there
had
never
been
any
easement
granted
to
any
governmental
body
for
the
use
of
any
portion
of
it,
so...
mr.
james
l.
deano
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found,
that...
mr.
james
l.
deano
the...
mr.
james
l.
deano
because
the
complaint
was
brought
under
a
theory
of
the
equal
protection
clause
recognizing
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
esmail
case,
and
we
submit
that
esmail
is
not
a
proper...
is
not
a
viable
cause
of
action
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
this
complaint
had
alleged...
mr.
james
l.
deano
because
the
reason
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
was
because
esmail
is
a
new
theory
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
there
had
been
no
other
cases
interpreting
it.
looking
at
the
complaint,
we
didn't
believe
that
it
fits
the...
mr.
james
l.
deano
and
that's
not
the
theory,
though,
that
the
respondent
brought
this
case
under,
and
the
petition
that
we
filed
asked
not
only
that
the
court
consider
whether
a
class
of
one
could
ever
file
an
equal
protection
claim,
it's
whether
a
class
of
one
who
is
alleging
that
the
class
was
created
by
vindictiveness,
because
vindictiveness
has
not
been
a
constitutionally
protected
interest.
mr.
james
l.
deano
that's
correct,
but
then
if
it
was
under
traditional
equal
protection
analysis
we
believe
that
the
district
court
took
the
right
approach
and
looked
for
a
rational
basis
for
what
the
government
did,
and
that's
why
the
case
was
dismissed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
l.
deano
no.
mr.
james
l.
deano
when
the
government
takes
a
position
that
differentiates,
creates
a
class,
then
i
think
the
question
is
whether...
what
is
that
class?
is
it
a
suspect
class,
or
is
it
not?
if
it's
not,
then
the
next
question
is,
was
there
any
conceivable
rational
basis
to
explain
what
the
government
did
here?
so
it
can
act
irrationally
if
there's
a
conceivable
rational...
not,
it
can
act
irrationally,
it
can
separate.
it
can
make
classes
if
there's
a
rational
basis
for
that.
mr.
james
l.
deano
i
think
it's
inconsistent
with
learned
hand's
position
in
burt,
but
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
snowden
decision
in
that
in
snowden
you
had
a
single
individual
who
claimed
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
in
illinois,
and
that
he
had
qualified
for
that,
and
that
the
canvassing
board
maliciously,
willfully,
and
arbitrarily
refused
him
that
right,
and
the
court
said
that
despite
those
allegations
you
have
not
alleged
intentional
or
purposeful
discrimination,
and
it
went
on
to
say...
mr.
james
l.
deano
vindictiveness?
mr.
james
l.
deano
well,
we
cite,
then,
u.s.
v.
o'brien
and
arlington
heights
and
washington
v.
davis
for
the
position
that
the
motivation,
which
vindictiveness...
mr.
james
l.
deano
snowden
i
think
it's
how
you
interpret
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination,
and
if
you
read
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination
broadly
in
that
it's
enough
to
say...
mr.
james
l.
deano
if
you
read
snowden
the
way
learned
hand
did,
yes.
what
he's
saying
is,
you
only
need
to
add
the
additional
allegation
that
the
reason
you
singled
me
out
was
because
you
were
coming
after
me,
and
we
submit
that...
what
esmail
does
is
turns
traditional
equal
protection
analysis
on
its
head,
because
it
now
says,
the
first
thing
you
do
is
look
at
an
allegation
of
motive,
and
if
the
motive
is
alleged
to
be
improper,
you
don't
have
to
go
through...
mr.
james
l.
deano
when
the...
what
would
give
rise
to
the
rational
basis
inquiry
is
the
allegation
that
i've
been
treated
separately
or
differently,
and
it's
a
bad
motive.
then
you
go
to
rational
basis,
and
that's
where
we
submit
that
this
complaint,
as
the
district
court
found,
alleges
a
rational
basis
because
the
reason
that
they
requested
it
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
this
was
a
nondedicated,
unimproved
road.
they
wanted
to
do
all
of
this...
mr.
james
l.
deano
that's
true,
and
at
that
point
they
made
a
decision
that
we
can't...
although
it
would
have
been
more
efficient
to
do
all
of
this
at
once,
to
widen
and
improve
the
road,
and
put
pavement
there,
if
she's
going
to
object
to
it,
they
consulted
the
village
attorney
and
the
village
attorney
said,
if
all
you
want
to
do
is
put
the
water
main
in,
then
15
feet
would
be
sufficient.
now...
mr.
james
l.
deano
i
agree.
mr.
james
l.
deano
yes.
mr.
james
l.
deano
yes,
and
under
u.s.
v.
o'brien
and
washington
v.
davis,
once
there
is
a
legitimate
purpose,
there's
no
need
to
look
into...
mr.
james
l.
deano
okay,
conceivable,
any
imaginable
by
the
court,
even
if
it's
not
pled
in
the
complaint,
but
we
believe
that
this
complaint
does
plead
that.
mr.
james
l.
deano
if
it
can
be
conceived,
then
there's
no
reason
to
look
into
the
record
for
why
they
might...
why
that
motive
might
not
have
been
the
correct
motive.
mr.
james
l.
deano
not
always.
not
always
dream
up
a
rational
basis,
but
when
a
complaint
like
this
alleges
facts
that
give
rise
to
that,
then
certainly,
and
i
agree
that
it's
what
can
be
conceived,
not
necessarily
what
is
found,
but
here
we
have
the
allegation
in
the
complaint.
mr.
james
l.
deano
there
is.
mr.
james
l.
deano
because
there's
a
suspect
class,
because
they've
differentiated
because
of...
mr.
james
l.
deano
that
would
be,
but
that's...
and
that
is
not
the
theory
that
has
been
pled
in
this
case.
the
theory
that
has
been
pled
is
what
our
argument
is
against,
that
esmail
says
that
vindictive
action
can
give
rise
to
an
equal
protection
claim
when
you
allege
differential
treatment
and
vindictiveness
as
the
cause
for
it,
or
the
motivation
for
it.
mr.
james
l.
deano
that's
correct,
but
then
we...
i
think
we
would
look
at
this
case
under
traditional
equal
protection
analysis,
and
the
question
would
be,
is
there
any
conceivable
rational
basis...
mr.
james
l.
deano
they
would...
i
think
they
require...
they
would
be
traditional
equal
protection
claims,
not...
mr.
james
l.
deano
because
they
have
alleged
that
they
are
proceeding
under
esmail,
which
is
not...
which
is
a
vindictiveness...
mr.
james
l.
deano
that's
correct.
they...
