mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
why
we
believe
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
resolving
the
class-of-one
issue,
but
if
the
court
reaches
the
question,
it
should
hold
that
a
class-of-one
claim
is
subject
to
the
same
analysis
as
other
equal
protection
claims.
that
means
that
unless
there
is
a
fundamental
right,
or
a
suspect
classification
involved,
rational
basis
review
applies,
and
under
rational
basis
review
the
relevant
inquiry
is
an
objective
one
into
whether
there
is
any
conceivable
rational
basis
for
the
alleged
difference
in
treatment.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
stevens,
it
would.
it
would
be...
it
would
implicate
the
fundamental
right
which
this
court
has
recognized...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it
is
this
case,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
told...
suggested
to
the
court...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
we
suggested
to
the
court
that
it
not
examine
the
class-of-one
issue,
because
the
class-of-one
issue
really
arises
when
there
is
no
suspect
classification
and
no
fundamental
right
involved,
but
this
happens
to
implicate
the
fundamental
right
to
file
a
lawsuit,
which
this
court
has
recognized
as
being
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
a
component
of
the
right
to
petition
for
a
redress
of
grievances.
if
the...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
they
actually
did,
in
their
factual
allegations,
allege
that
the
basis
for
the
retaliation
was
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit,
and
that
is
in
joint
appendix
10,
allegation
number
27.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
in
that
case,
when
you
have
a
first
amendment
right
at
issue,
the
sequence
of
events
is
dictated
by
this
court's
decision
in
doyle,
which
says
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
to
show
that
a
motivating
factor
in
the
decision
was
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
and
at
that
point,
if
the
plaintiff
establishes
that
initial
burden,
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
show
that
the
same
decision
would
have
been
reached
even
the...
even
in
the
absence
of
the
consideration
of
the
protected
activity.
but
where
there
is
no
fundamental
right
at
stake,
and
that
is
a
hypothesis
of
the
question
presented,
the
only
question
is
whether
there
is
a
conceivable
rational
basis
for
treating
the
plaintiff
differently
from
others
and,
if
there
is,
the
inquiry
ends.
you
do
not
inquire
at
all
into
the
actual
subjective
motivations
for
the
decision.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
this
court
recently
issued
a
per
curiam
decision
this
term,
and
i
believe
it's
called
le
sage,
in
which
the
government
took
the
action
on
the
base
of
race
and...
in
part,
and
the
government
was
able
to
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
the
same
thing
would
have
occurred
even
absent
the
consideration
of
race,
and
in
that
event
there
is
at
least
no
award
for
past
conduct.
there...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
i'm
just
talking
about
a
hypothetical
scenario
where
there's
a
first
amendment
claim
raised,
and
then
it
would
be...
it
would
usually
require
a
trial
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
the
actual...
the
defendant
would
have
taken
the
same
action
in
any
event.
let
me...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
is
a
constitutional
right
for
people
who
are
being
treated
equally...
who
are
similarly
situated,
in
fact,
to
be
treated
equally,
but
how
the
court
approaches
that
question
depends
on
whether
there's
a
suspect
classification
or
a
fundamental
right
involved.
if
neither
of
those
are
involved,
then
the
relevant
inquiry
is,
is
there
any
conceivable
rational
basis
for
treating
differently
plaintiff
from
the
persons
that
the
plaintiff
alleges
to
be
similarly
situated.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
is
the...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
because
i
think
the
basic
principle
that
the
court
has
established
is...
under
rational
basis
review
is
a
baseline
of
protection,
but
only
against
those
classifications,
or
those
different...
intentional
differences
in
treatment
that
lack
any
conceivable
rational
basis...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
do
not.
i
tell
them
that
there
should
be
a
conceivable
rational
basis
for
that
decision,
and
that
that
is
not
an
impermissible
way
to
proceed.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
when
the
case
comes
to
court,
then
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
conceivable
rational
basis
and,
if
there
is
under
this
court's
decisions
in
fritz
and
in
beech,
then
the
inquiry
is
at
an
end.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
because
there
are
two
components
to
the
equal
protection
cause
of
action.
first,
as
snowden
v.
hughes
had
said,
there
has
to
be
an
intentional
difference
in
treatment
between
the
plaintiff
and
others
who
are
alleged...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
then,
at
that
point,
then
all...
the
inquiry
is
really
a
very
simple
one
into
whether
there
is
any
conceivable,
rational
basis...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
because
there...
i
could
hypothesize
ones
in
particular
cases
that
may
come
up.
for
example,
in
this
case
let's
put
aside
the
first
amendment
for
a
moment.
it
may
be
that
somebody
could
establish
that
there
was...
somebody
was
out
to
get
somebody,
but
if
there
was
a
conceivable
rational
basis
such
as
the
one
that
the
petitioner
is
suggesting
here,
that
unlike
every
other
person
in
this
town,
this
person
is
asking
for
access
for
water
from
a
nonpublic
road,
that
could
supply
a
conceivable
rational
basis
for
treating
that
plaintiff
differently
from
everybody
else
in
the
village.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
in
certain
limited
situations
the
court
has
concluded
that
motive
inquiries
are
essential
to
protect
against
the
most
invidious
forms
of
discrimination
and
protect
the
most
fundamental
rights,
but
when
those
rights
are
not
implicated,
then
rational
basis
review
applies,
and
that
is
supported,
really,
by
three
related...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
stevens,
it
may
or
may
not
explain
it.
i
suppose
the
possible...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does,
and
the
possible
explanation...
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
possible
explanation
would
be
that
the
city
has
a
policy
for
some
reason
that
it
does
not
want
to
furnish
access
to
people
for
water
over
roads
that
are
not
their
own.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm...
justice
stevens,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
the
complaint
itself
doesn't
state
a
claim.
it
may
or
may
not
state
a
claim.
i
think
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
that's
not
the
question
before
the
court,
whether
this
complaint
does
or
doesn't
state
a
class-of-one
claim.
the
question
is
whether
a
person
in
a
class
of
one
can
state
a
claim.
i
think
all
the
court
has
to
say
if
it
gets
to
this
question
is
that
yes,
a
person
in
a
class
of
one
can
state
a
claim,
but
unless...
if
there's
no
fundamental
right
or
suspect
classification
involved,
only
by
showing
there's
no
conceivable
rational
basis
for
treating
the
plaintiff
differently
from
others
who
are
similarly
situated.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
not
say
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
the
complaint
can
state
the
facts
that
show
that
they
are
apparently
being
treated
differently
from
other...
others
who
are
similarly
situated.
were
it
not
for
the
one
paragraph
in
the
complaint
the
petitioner
mentioned
which
suggested
a
possible
rational
basis,
the
complaint
clearly
would
have
stated
a
claim
in
our
view,
but
it
is
by
raising
in
the
complaint
itself
a
possible
rational
basis
that
the
issue
arises
as
to
whether
you
can
dismiss
the
complaint
here.
