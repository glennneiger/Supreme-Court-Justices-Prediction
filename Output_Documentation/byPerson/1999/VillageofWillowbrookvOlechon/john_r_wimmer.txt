mr.
john
r.
wimmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
get
into
the
merits
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
on
behalf
of
the
village
of
willowbrook,
i'd
like
to
address
the
matter
of
what
questions
are
properly
before
this
court
in
this
case.
as
the
court
is
aware,
there
were
two
questions
raised
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
first
being
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
one
where
the
plaintiff
has
not
alleged
membership
in
a
vulnerable
group,
but
rather
that
ill
will
caused
the
government
to
treat
her
differently
from
others
similarly
situated.
the
second
question
was
whether
the
government
conduct
alleged
in
mrs.
olech's
amended
complaint
meets
the
standard
to
state
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
one,
assuming
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
such
individuals.
now,
this
court
in
this
case
granted
certiorari
limited
to
question
one,
and
what
that
means,
i
believe,
is
that
arguments
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
question
two
are
not
properly
before
this
court
because
this
court
has
in
effect
denied
certiorari
on
question
two,
and
we've
cited
the
case
of
missouri
v.
jenkins
from
this
court,
where
there
was
a
limited
grant
of
certiorari
on
one
of
two
questions,
and
in
that
case,
which
was
a
school
desegregation
case,
the
state
made
arguments
that
really
fell
within
the
scope
of
the
question
which
had
not
been...
on
which
certiorari
had
not
been
granted,
and
this
court
said
that
those
questions
would
not
be
considered.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
i
don't
know
that
they
can
be
totally
separated.
i
know
in
missouri
v.
jenkins
the
second
question
was
whether
the
tax
increase
ordered
by
the
district
court
in
the
school
desegregation
case
violated
federal-state
comity.
the
first
question
was
whether
the
remedy
was
too
broad,
and
when
the
state
tried
to
argue
that
it
violated
federal-state
comity
because
the
remedy
was
too
broad,
this
court
indicated
that
that
wouldn't
be
within
the
scope
of
the
grant.
i
think
in
this
case
when
the
village
argues
that
mrs.
olech's
specific
amended
complaint
failed
to
sufficiently
allege
that
there
was
not
a
rational
basis
related
to
a
legitimate
government
interest,
that
doesn't
go
to
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
a
class
of
one.
that
falls
within
question
2,
whether
this
particular
amended
complaint
meets
the
standard
to
state
a
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
assuming
that
that
clause
protects
such
individuals.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
advisory
opinion
necessarily,
because
although
there
are
five
people
involved,
i
think
the
principal
the
class
of
one...
the
distinction
is
between
a
class
of
one
and
a
vulnerable
group.
whether
there's
two,
or
five,
or
one,
i
think
the
same
considerations
would
apply
if
it's
not
a
vulnerable
group,
as
stated
by
the
village.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
yes.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
i
did.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
your
honor,
i
did
state
in
paragraph
27,
and
this
is
on
page
10
of
the
appendix,
that
the
defendants
treated
plaintiff
grace
olech
and
thaddeus
olech,
howard
brinkman,
and
rodney
c.
zimmer
and
phyllis
s.
zimmer
differently
from
other
property
owners
in
the
village
of
willowbrook
by
demanding
the
33-foot
easements
and
the
66-foot
dedicated
street
as
a
condition
of
the
extension
of
the
water
main
because
of
the
ill
will
generated
by
the
state
court
lawsuit,
and
in
an
attempt
to
control
storm
water
drainage
in
the
vicinity
to
the
detriment
of
plaintiff
grace
olech
and
thaddeus
olech
and
other
plaintiffs
in
the
state
court
lawsuit
by
the
use
of
ditches
and
swales
along
tennessee
avenue.
so
when
the
village
says
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
they
wanted
the
33
feet
for
all
these
good
purposes,
that's
not
what
it
alleges.
it
alleges
they
made
those
demands
out
of
ill
will
caused
by
the
lawsuit.
the
paragraph
cited
by
the
village
simply
says
they
sent
the
proposed
easement
which
would
give
them
the
right
to
do
all
those
things,
but
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
that
is
why
the
village
made
those
demands.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
if
the
lawsuit
that
was
brought
was
meritorious,
i
think
it
would
be.
i
think
if
there
had
been
a
lot
of...
and
i
think
about
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
this
case,
california
motor
transport,
and
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government
which
indicate
that
if
the
lawsuit
is
not...
doesn't
have
probable
cause,
or
if
it's
a
harassing
lawsuit,
or
something
like
that,
then
the
first
amendment
implications
aren't
there.
in
this
case,
the
state
court
lawsuit,
we
prevailed
and
got
a
judgment
against
the
village
of
willowbrook,
so...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
i
think
if...
it
would
come
down
to
what
the
propensity
to
litigate
in
cases
that
are
not
valid,
that
would
probably
be
a
proper
consideration
for
the
village
to
take
into
account.
that's
not
what
happened
here,
though,
because
the
one
case
was
a
valid
case
and
went
to
judgment.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
we
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
the
decision
was...
and
this
is
on
page
10...
wholly...
strike
that...
irrational
and
wholly
arbitrary,
and
we've
also
alleged
that
it
was
based
on
ill
will
and
i
think
that,
as
judge
posner
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
tincture
of
ill
will
will
not
render
government
action
unconstitutional
if
it
would
have
happened
anyway.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
it
was
irrational
because
the
village
attorney
admitted
that
they
didn't
need
a
66-foot
street
dedication
to
install
and
maintain
a
water
main,
and
they
didn't
demand
it
of
other
people
in
the
village.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
mrs.
olech's
situation
is
somehow
unique,
there's
no
basis
in
the
complaint
to
conclude
that
that
is
the
case,
and
that
there
are
not
other
nondedicated
streets
in
the
village.
under
hishon
v.
king
&
spaulding
this
court
is
to
construe...
or
all
courts
are
to
construe
complaints
favorably
to
the
plaintiff
and
reach
all
reasonable
inferences
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
and
what
the
village
is
asking
you
to
do
is
the
exact
contrary,
to
assume
that
this
was
the
only
dedicated
street
and
make
conclusions
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
probably
not,
judge,
although
this
court
did
say
in
the
city
of
cleburne
v.
cleburne
living
center
that
some
objectives,
such
as
a
bare
desire
to
harm
a
politically
unpopular
group,
are
not
legitimate
state
interests.
i
think
in
this
case,
where
there
was
no
conceivable
rational
explanation
for
the
city's
disparate
treatment
of
mrs.
olech,
and
she's
alleged
that
they
were
out
to
punish
her
for
filing
a
meritorious
lawsuit
against
the
village,
that
there's
enough.
but
i
do
think
that
this
whole
concept
of
whether
the
particular
amended
complaint
in
this
case
adequately
states
a
cause
of
action
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
your
honor,
i
think
there's
sufficient
protection
from
municipalities
or
government
in
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
there
was
no
rational
basis,
no
conceivable
rational
basis
related
to
legitimate
government
interests
for
the
conduct.
that's
going
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
frivolous
lawsuits
against
municipalities.
if
a
municipality
can
have
an
affidavit,
we
did
it
for
this
reason,
and
totally
logical
and
rational,
and
advances
a
legitimate
government
interest,
the
case
is
over.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
i
agree
that
a
rational
basis
related
to
a
legitimate
government
interest
for
the
disparate
treatment
would
indicate
that
there
was
no
equal
protection
violation.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
based
on
the
facts
that
are
before
the
court,
yes.
i
don't
think
there
is
one
here,
because
that
also
runs
into
the
rule
that
in
hishon
v.
king
&
spaulding,
if
there
are
any
set
of
facts
consistent
with
the
complaint
by
which
it
could
be
concluded
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
related,
or
no
conceivable
rational
basis
related
to
a
legitimate
government
interest,
then
the
case
should
go
on.
with
respect
to
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
a
class
of
one...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
that
the
equal
protection
clause...
oh,
do
we
have
a
class
of
one
in
this
case?
that's
the
way
it
was
argued.
there
certainly
are
five
people,
as
the
government
has
pointed
out,
that
filed
the
state
lawsuit,
and
they
were
all
treated
differently
by
the
village
of
willowbrook.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
i
don't
believe
so.
i
did
object
to
the
presentation
of
some
questions,
but
not
that.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
class
of
one
is
protected...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
yes.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
district
court
the
village
of
willowbrook
acknowledged
that
a
cause
of
action
for
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
could
be
brought
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
one.
they
took
that
position
but
argued
that...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
right.
they
did
not
say
we
want
to
preserve
another
issue
for
appellate
review.
with
respect
to
the
question
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari,
i
think
it's
important
to
recall
that
governments
derive
their
power
from
the
consent
of
the
governed,
and
that
the
legitimacy
of
government
action
is
based
on
that.
in
our
country
the
consent
of
the
governed
is
set
forth
in
the
written
constitution,
and
i
think
in
interpreting
the
language
of
the
constitution,
the
language
of
that
grant,
it's
important
to
adhere
to
the
language
that
the
people
have
chosen
to
use,
especially
when
construing
a
protection
that
the
people
saw
fit
to
secure
for
themselves,
and
that
no
court
should
engraft
limitations
on
the
application
of
a
protection
like
that
that
the
people
didn't
see
fit
to
put
in
it,
because
then
what
would
happen
to
the
consent
of
the
governed,
and
the
legitimacy
of
the
exercise
of
government
power?
as
justice
story
said
in
martin
v.
hunter's
lessee,
which
i
cited
in
my
brief,
the
words
are
to
be
taken
in
their
natural
and
obvious
sense,
and
not
in
a
sense
unreasonably
restricted
or
enlarged.
with
that
background,
if
one
looks
at
the
language
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
nor
shall
any
state
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
i
think
there's
no
basis
to
conclude
that
that
provision
should
be
limited
in
its
application
to
someone
who
says
i'm
being
discriminated
against
because
of
membership
in
a
group
or
class.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
i
don't
think
i
did
include
in
my
complaint
a
rational
basis
for
the
village
of
willowbrook
to
treat
mrs.
olech
differently
from
other
property
owners.
when
one
decides
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
related
to
a
legitimate
government
interest,
it
should
not
be
considered
in
the
abstract,
and
the
village
can
always
say,
we
wanted
to
build
a
road
here.
the
question
is,
was
there...
and
in
the
case
i
cited,
sioux
city
bridge
company,
where
one
taxpayer's
property
was
assessed
higher
than
everybody
else's,
the
government
can
only
say,
we
had
a
rational
basis
to
assess
his
property
100
percent.
that's
what
it
was
worth.
you
have
to
look,
is
there
a
rational
basis
related
to
a
legitimate
government
interest
for
the
difference
in
treatment?
they
may
well
have
wanted
a
road,
but
if
they
didn't
demand
of
everyone
who
wished
to
have
municipal
water
a
road,
then
there
was
no
rational
basis
to
treat
her
differently
from
everybody
else
in
the
city
by
demanding
a
road.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
i
think...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
i
think
one
could
argue
convincingly
in
light
of
your
honor's
language
in
the
cleburne
case
that
if
the
city
admitted
that
they
were
doing
it
to
punish
a
person,
a
politically
unpopular
person
or
group,
that
the
plaintiff
would
prevail.
that's
not
a
legitimate
government
interest.
this
court
has
stated...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
i
think,
as
i
say,
that
a
convincing
argument
can
be
made
under
cleburne
that
if
they
made
that
concession,
that
it
was
not...
it
was
what
this
court
has
said
to
be
not
a
legitimate
government
interest
that
motivated
them
to
take
that
action,
that
there
would
be
an
equal
protection...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
that's
a
good
question,
although
in
this
case...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
in
this
case,
where
the
complaint
does
not
show
a
rational
basis
related
to
a
legitimate
government
interest
for
the
disparate
treatment,
i
think
it
is
proper
to
inquire
into
the
motive,
however,
judge...
or,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor...
because
i
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
that
connotes
purposeful
conduct
on
behalf
of
the
village,
so
i
think
that
an
allegation
that
they
were
retaliating
against
them
for
filing
a
lawsuit
shows
that
it
was
not
simply
uneven
law
enforcement,
or
an
accidental
disparate
treatment,
but
an...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
well,
yes.
at
this
point
i
have
alleged
that
it
was
irrational.
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
and...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
i
believe
i
do,
your
honor.
i
allege...
mr.
john
r.
wimmer
that's
right,
although
i
think
in
this
case
that's
not
what
we
have,
since
i've
alleged
both,
and
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
have
to
be
accepted
as
true
at
this
point.
briefly,
with
respect
to
exhaustion
of
remedies,
that's
another
question
which
i
believe
is
not
properly
before
the
court
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
was
not
ever
mentioned
prior
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
by
the
village.
it
was
not
mentioned
in
the
district
court,
where
i
could
have
amended
the
complaint
if
there
was
a
technical
deficiency,
and
also,
even
if
your
honors
intend
to
address
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
issue,
i
believe
the
court
has
already
held
at
least
two
times
that
one
need
not
exhaust
his
state
remedies
in
order
to
state
a
claim
for
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
on
this
rationally
related
argument,
what
this
really
comes
down
to
is
whether
it
was
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest
for
willowbrook
to
demand
private
property
rights
of
mrs.
olech
and
the
other
plaintiffs
in
the
state
court
case
as
a
condition
of
receiving
running
water
when
those
rights
were
not
demanded
of
others
as
a
condition
of
receiving
running
water,
and
where
the
private
property
rights
were
not
required
for
installation
and
maintenance
of
the
water
main.
that's
what
the
complaint
says,
and
i
think
that
question
really
answers
itself.
there's
not
a
rational
basis
based
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
one
other
point
the
village
makes
is,
they
argue
that
the
road
was
already
in
existence,
and
that
they
simply
desired
to
establish
their
right
to
maintain
it.
the
complaint
does
not
allege
how
wide
the
road
is,
and
since
it's
not
in
the
record
i'm
not
going
to
state
how
wide
it
is,
but
i
think
if
that's
a
significant
fact
the
inference
should
be
drawn
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
that
the
road
is
substantially
narrower
than
the
66-foot
road
that
they
were
demanding
be
put
in.
so
i'd
like
to
thank
the
court.
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
to
everybody,
whether
they're
a
member
of
a
class
or
group
or
not.
it
certainly
applies
to
mrs.
olech.
thank
you.
