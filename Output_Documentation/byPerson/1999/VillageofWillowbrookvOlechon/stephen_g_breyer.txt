justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
the
complaint
alleging...
it
may
not
be
right,
but
it
alleges
a
difference.
it
says,
from
us
they
wanted
66
feet
to
build
a
road.
from
everybody
else
in
the
town
they
wanted
15
feet,
which
isn't
enough
to
build
the
road,
and
there's
no
basis
for
this
distinction.
that's
what
i
took
it
as
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
how,
then,
can
you
say
that
on
its
face
the
complaint
doesn't
state
a
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
may
be
right
or
wrong
about
that,
i
don't
know.
the...
but
we
took
the
case,
i
take
it,
to
decide
whether
there
was
a...
one
person
could
state
an
equal
protection
claim,
and
the
first
thing
i
read
is
that
this
isn't
one
person,
it's
five.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
should
we
get
into
this
much
more
difficult
question
about
motive
and
so
forth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
that
they're
singled
out
because
of
the
government's
motive,
and
it
also
happens
that
there's
no
rational
basis,
which
i
take
it
is
what
judge
posner
said.
he
said...
he
said,
they
have
stated
a
claim
where
the
only
reason
that
anybody
could
give
as
far
as
the
complaint's
concerned
for
this
distinction
is
hatred
or
malice
or
some
absurd
state
of
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
get
his
exact
words,
if
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
says,
if
it
refuses
to
perform
this
obligation
for
one
of
the
residents
for
no
reason...
no
reason.
no
reason...
other
than
a
baseless
hatred,
then
it
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
we
have
the
record.
it's
the
complaint.
i
don't
see
any
rational
basis
in
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
in
every
case
of
defamation,
libel,
intentional
torts
committed
by
a
state
officer,
breach
of
contract,
where
let's
assume
the
state's
wrong
in
all
those
cases?
now,
those
are
all
illegal
activities,
so
i
don't
know
what
the
rational
basis
would
be.
now,
does
every
one
of
those
actions
become
an
equal
protection
clause
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
in
every
such
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
could
there
be
in
cases
where
the
government's
committed
an
intentional
tort,
or
intentionally
breached
a
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
as
to
question
1,
it
talks
about
a
class
of
one,
and
the
complaint
itself
reveals
that
they're
a
class
of
five,
at
least,
so
wouldn't
it
be
a
totally
hypothetical
advisory
opinion
to
answer
question
1
in
the
context
of
a
case
that
doesn't
raise
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
your
theory?
if
we
go
to
this
other
issue,
i
can
see
two
situations.
1,
a
plaintiff
says,
there
is
no
rational
basis
conceivable,
and
they're
motivated
by
ill
will.
situation
2
is,
the
plaintiff
says,
they
had
a
brilliant
reason,
a
perfect
reason,
an
outstanding
reason.
however,
they
were
motivated
by
ill
will
in
reality.
now,
does
this
case
raise
issue
2?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
had
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
conceivable
rational
purpose,
and
animus.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
get
rid
of
the
former,
i
guess
we
have
a
federal
lawsuit
even
if
the
land
was
set
aside
as
coastal
land,
you
know,
a
wonderful
reason,
has
the
most
beautiful
view
in
the
state,
but
it
turns
out,
it's
alleged,
that
the
real
reason
he
did
it
is,
he
didn't
like
the
landowner.
i
mean,
once
you
get
rid
of
a
conceivable,
rational
basis,
you
open
the
court
to
lawsuits
no
matter
how
good
the
reason
was,
as
long
as
there's
an
allegation
of
animus.
