mr.
deano,
one
problem
i
have
with
that
answer
is,
how
do
we
get
even
to
know
what
the
purpose
of
the
government
was
when
this
case
is
tossed
out
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion
and
all
we're
supposed
to
look
at
is
the
face
of
the
complaint,
and
the
complaint
doesn't
say
anything
about,
they
wanted
to
widen
the
road.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the...
the
complaint
said
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
have
the...
do
we
have
the
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
is
the
part
where
the
plaintiff
sets
out
that
the
state's...
that
the
village's
reason...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
then,
shouldn't
you
read
this
complaint
to
say,
they
wanted
33
feet
to
widen
the
road,
but
everybody
else,
they
wanted
only
15
feet.
fine,
if
they
want
33,
they
exercise
their
power
of
eminent
domain
and
they
pay
us
for
the
difference
between
33
and
15.
if
that's
what
the
complaint
is
saying,
we're
supposed
to
read
it
liberally,
then
the
12(b)(6)
dismissal
is
improper,
because
the
complaint
would
not
have
on
its
face...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
that
reason
still
be
inadequate
if
everybody
else
was
either
not
asked
for
the
33,
or
paid
for
the
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you...
does
that
carry
as
far
as
saying,
yeah,
we
conceived
it,
but
it
has
been
shown
on
this
record
that
that
was
indeed
not
the
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
is
a
tempest
in
a
teapot,
is
essentially
what
you're
saying.
yeah,
you
can
have
a
class
of
one,
but
the
court
can
always
dream
up
a
rational
basis
for
what
government
does,
and
so,
end
of
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
deano
said
that's
not
the
theory
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint.
they
didn't
make
retaliation
for
filing
the
litigation
the
basis
for
the
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
complaint
has
to
conjure
up
every
conceivable
basis
and
negate
it?
that's
what
the
pleading
is
supposed
to
look
like?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
didn't
you
include
the
theory
that
mr.
deano
suggested
may
have
been
okay,
that
is,
it
was
retaliation
for
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
right
to
sue
the
village?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
is
your
answer,
mr.
wimmer,
to
the
argument
that
you
have
pled
yourself
out
of
court
by
making
your
statement
of
the
class
of
one
or
five
but
then
including
in
the
complaint
a
rational
basis
for
seeking
more
land,
that
is,
they
wanted
to
make
the
street?
