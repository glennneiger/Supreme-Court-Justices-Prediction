justice
antonin
scalia
when
is
it...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
keep
referring
to
impermissible.
all
the
constitution
says
is,
you
shall
not
deny
people
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
that's
constitutionally
impermissible,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
not,
if
there's
a
rational
basis
for
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
becomes
constitutionally
impermissible
when
there
is
no
rational
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
a
perfectly
rational
basis.
we
want
an
additional
40
feet.
we're
greedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
perfectly
rational,
you
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
certainly
an
intentional
difference
in
treatment.
they're
intentionally
trying
to
get
50
feet
from
one
person
and
only
10
feet
from
another.
isn't
that
enough
of
a...
you
say
that's
not
enough
of
an
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
enough,
according
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
your
hatred
is
not
baseless,
it's
okay.
i
mean,
if
you
really...
this
woman
deserves
to
be
hated,
or
something...
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
make
it
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
a
rational
basis,
not
for
taking
the
33
feet,
but
a
rational
basis
for
treating
this
person
different
from
other
people,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
other
people,
they
did
not
have
the
need
for
the
33
feet
from
other
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
always...
you're
talking
about
rational
basis
as
though
it
means
actual
rational
basis.
i
had
always
thought
that
our
rational
basis
test
means
a
conceivable
rational
basis.
we
don't
look
to
whether
the
state
actually
had
this
rational
basis
in
mind.
it
might
have.
this
is
a
basis
that
we
invent
in
our
own
imagination,
and
since
that
could
have
supported
it,
there's
a
rational
basis,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
assert
that
that
conceivable
rational
basis
will
overcome
a
claim
of
a
violation
of
equal
protection
even
when
you
can
bring
in
evidence
to
show
that,
oh
yeah,
that
might
have
been
a
rational
basis,
but
in
fact
they
were
out
to
get
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
not
use
that
rational
basis.
they
were
out
to
get
me.
you
would
say
still
no
equal
protection
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
beginning
to
talk
subjectively
again.
once
there
is
a...
once
there
is
a
conceivable
legitimate
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
say
that.
they
don't
have
to
say
we
did
it
for
this
reason.
they
have
to
say,
we
might
have
done
it
for
this
reason...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
a
class
of
one?
what's
your
position
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
objection
that
a
class
of
five
is
not
a
class
of
one,
was
this
made
at
the
petition
stage
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
stupidity
clause
in
the
constitution...
justice
antonin
scalia
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
somewhere
we
could
get
them
on,
or
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
there's
a
presumption...
why
not
litigate
it,
then?
if
the
fact
that
they
did
it
out
of
maliciousness
should
justify
judgment
for
the
plaintiff,
then
we
should
litigate
the
point,
but
why
should
we
just
allow
it
when
they
admit
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
good
question.
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
throw
us
right
back
into
the
pool
that
we
thought
we
had
jumped
out
of.
