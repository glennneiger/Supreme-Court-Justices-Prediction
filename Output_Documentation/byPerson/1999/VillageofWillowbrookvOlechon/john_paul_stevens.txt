do
you
think
your
argument
is
consistent
either
with
the...
justice
stone's
opinion
in
snowden
or
with
learned
hand's
opinion
in
burt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
the
missing
allegation
was
precisely
the
allegation
you've
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
one
confined
himself
to
snowden
and
burt,
you
would
lose.
these
later
cases
you
rely
on
i
understand,
but
it
seems
to
me
those
two
cases
are
definitely
against
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
read
snowden
the
way
learned
hand
read
it,
then
you
lose,
and
he's
usually
a
pretty
good
judge,
we
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
an
allegation
of
motive
like
that
can
also
be
construed
as
saying
there
was
no
other
rational
basis
that
can
explain
this
except
that
motive,
so
it's
really
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
allegation
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
what
you
did,
which
tends
to
be
consistent
with
the
notion
that
the
city
later,
came
round
later
and
said
15
feet's
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
still
nondedicated
when
they
said
15
feet's
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
vindictiveness
allegedly
was
in
retaliation
for
filing
a
lawsuit,
which
i
assume
she
had
a
statutory
right
at
least
to
file.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
filing...
if...
why,
if
the
vindictiveness
on
one
hand
is
caused
by
hostility
to
race,
another
case
it's
caused
by
hostility
to
the
fact
that
the...
a
lawsuit
was
filed.
you
would
say
they're
different
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what...
why
isn't
this
the
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
allege
that
the
vindictiveness
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
they
filed
this
earlier
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
had
a
class
of
litigants
against
the
city,
and
they
had
a
rule
that
anybody
who
sues
the
city,
will
get
disparate
treatment,
33
feet
instead
of
15
feet,
and
that's
their
policy.
would
that
be
an
equal
protection
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
so
you
agree
with
respondent,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
with
one
question.
why
does
the
fact
that
a
nonpublic
road
is
involved
explain
the
disparate
treatment
between
15
feet
and
33
feet?
how
can
that
possibly
explain
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
a
rational
basis
for...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
its
face
it
isn't
rational.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
policy
is
surely
not
disclosed
in
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
a
variation...
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
justice
scalia's
question?
in
the
trial
proceedings,
was
there
an
objection
to
the
complaint
made
on
the
basis
that
there
was
only
a
class
of
one
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
was
a
law
of
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
about
a
concession
you
made
earlier?
supposing
you
had
a
complaint
that
alleged
vindictive
discrimination,
33
feet
because
they
hated
the
person,
and
the
city
filed
an
answer
and
said
yes,
that's
the
real
reason
we
did
it,
but
our
lawyer
has
told
us
we
might
have
done
it
for
this
rational
reason.
we
didn't
do
it,
but
we
might
have.
who
would
win
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
not
a
totally
hypothetical
question,
either,
to
respond
to
my
good
colleague,
because
sometimes
you
take
depositions
before
the
answer
is
filed,
and
the
depositions
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
was
the
real
purpose,
but
then
they
conceive
of
a
legitimate
purpose
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why,
if
they
only
make
the
concession?
