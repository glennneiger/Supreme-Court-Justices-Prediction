justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
ever
said...
has
this
court
ever
said
that
in
the
abstract
there's
some
free-floating
duty
for
the
government
always
to
act
rationally?
we
haven't
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
duty
to
act
rationally
applies
only
when
the
government's
actions
affect
a
certain
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
the
reason
that
government
was
out
to
get
the
person
was
because
of
race,
there's
a
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
because
it's
a
suspect
class,
or
there's
a
constitutional
right
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they're
discriminating
allegedly
because
of
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
we
begin
our
opinion
in
this
case
by
saying
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
similarly
situated
persons
to
be
treated
equally
under
the
law?
is
that
our
opening
line?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
necessary
to
reduce
the
number
of
suits
filed
in
federal
court,
to
reduce
the
intervention
of
courts
in
routine
governmental
actions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
compromising
the
basic
principle
by
saying
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you're
a
county
council
and
the
board
of
commissioners
said,
we're
going
to
bury
this
application
because
we
just
don't
like
this
guy,
you
tell
them
that
that
is
constitutionally
permissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
result
is
otherwise
if
race
is
the
basis,
because
of
history,
the
core
principle
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
or
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
know
what's
bothering
us,
that
if
we
accept
your
theory,
then
in
those
thousands,
tens
of
thousands
of
zoning
decisions
where
local
personalities
are
involved
and
difficult
discretionary
judgments
are
made,
it's
going
to
always
be
followed
by
a
lawsuit
of
ill
will.
and
we
simply
are
concerned
about
having
the
federal
courts
become
the
ultimate
policeman
of
the
zoning
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
this
respect
you're
in
agreement
with
the
government's
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
conceivable
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
the
way
judge
posner's
view
could
be
explained
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
government
acted
for
a
reasonable
purpose,
and
if
there's
specific
evidence
to
the
contrary,
then
the
case
can
proceed
and
it
just
becomes
a
pleading
case.
