justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
agree,
then,
that
there
may
be
a
claim
stated
by
an
individual
who
is
not
otherwise
a
member
of
a
class
if
the
individual
states
that
the
differential
treatment
is
not
rationally
related
to
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
do
you
agree
with
that
formulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
say
it
alleges
a
rational
basis
because
establishing
roads
is
a
governmental
objective.
is
that
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
rational
basis
for
the
differential
treatment?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
your
theory
is
that
the
government
can
treat
people
in
any
otherwise
unjustifiably
differential
way
so
long
as
in
isolation
it
has
a
legitimate
objective
for
treating
each
individual
in
the
way
the
individual
is
treated?
in
other
words,
if
the
government
says,
well,
i
think
we'll
take
10
feet
from
this
property
owner,
25
feet
from
the
property
owner
next
door,
and
50
feet
from
the
property
owner
next
door
to
him,
in
each
instance
we're
going
to
take
this
land
because
we
want
to
establish
streets,
and
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
so
long
as
in
each
instance
they
want
to
establish
streets,
the
fact
that
they
are
intentionally
differentiating
in
the
amount
of
land
taken
is
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
in
other
words,
a
rational
basis
for
the
difference
in
treatment?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's
asking
rather
a
lot
of
a
court
like
this.
i
mean,
i
thought
we
took
this
case
to
find
out
whether
one
person
who
was
not
otherwise
a
member
of
a
class
can
state
an
equal
protection
claim,
and
i
think
perhaps
we're
at
the
point
where
everybody
is
agreeing
that
the
answer
is
yes,
and
the
argument
now
is
whether,
in
response
to
that
claim,
it
can
be
found
on
this
record
that
there
is
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
to
which
the
demand
was
rationally
related,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
really
what
we're
in
business
for
here.
