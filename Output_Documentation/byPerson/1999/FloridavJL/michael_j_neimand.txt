mr.
michael
j.
neimand
neimand,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
an
anonymous
tip
that
provides
a
specific
location
and
a
specific
description
of
individuals,
and
one
of
the
individuals
is
carrying
a
gun,
provides
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
make
a
terry
stop
and
frisk
when
only
the
innocent
details,
that
is,
the
location
and
the
identity
of
the
individuals,
are
immediately
verified.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
under
such
facts
that
would
never
provide
reasonable
suspicion
to
allow
for
the
stop.
the
florida
supreme
court
requires
further
verification
of
either
future
predictive
behavior
or
observation
of
criminal
activity
in
order
for
the
stop
to
be
effectuated.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
the
closest
case
that
we
have
is
alabama
v.
white,
where
on
facts
similar
to
this
the
court
held
that
it
was
a
close
call,
but
in
fact
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
drug
case,
the
police
officers
acted
upon
a
little
more
than
we
had
here.
some
of
the
predictive
activity
did
not
occur,
and
a
small
amount
of
the
predictive
activity
did
occur,
but
that
predictive
activity
was
innocent.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
closest
case,
but
also,
if
you...
when
we
read
alabama
v.
white,
this
court
said
that
that
question
of
the
anonymous
tip,
in
and
of
itself,
was
left
open
and
would
be
left
to
be
decided
another
day.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case,
where
we're
dealing
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
a
firearm,
the
public/officer
safety
concerns
come
into
effect.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
a
firearm
exception
would
basically
say
any
time
a
tip
says
a
firearm,
that's
all
that's
needed.
what
the
state
is
arguing
here
is
that
when
there
is
a
firearm
involved,
then
that
is
one
of
the
circumstances
that
we
look
at
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
determine
whether
the
anonymous
tip
is
valid.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it
is
a--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--it's
a
regulated
privilege,
not
a
right
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
that
allows
for
a--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct,
10
days
shy
of
his
16th
birth
date.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it...
that
would
depend--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--that
would
depend--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--your
honor,
that
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances.
we--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
it's
a
fact
that
we're
looking
at
reliability
that
someone
who
had
seen
what
was
going
on
made
a
phone
call
to
the
police,
that
they
described
the
individuals,
and
that
information
contained
a
description,
a
location,
and
the
fact
that
one
of
the
individuals
was
carrying
a
firearm.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
i--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
in
the
search
and
seizure
area
the
state
has
cited
numerous
cases
where
we
do
look
at
officer
safety
in
extending
searches
and
frisks.
we
look
at
the
new
york
v.
belton,
where
we
have
an
ability
to
search
the
car
for
weapons
after
the
individual
is
already
in
the
police
car.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
the
intrusions
between
probable
cause
and
a
reasonable-suspicion
terry
frisk
are
a
little
bit
different.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
and
that--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
because
the
intrusions
are
different,
and
you
would
need
more
for
a
full-scale
arrest
and
search
when
there's
probable
cause,
because
you
have
to
establish
probable
cause,
and
probable
cause
i
don't
believe
is
as
fluid
a
situation
as
reasonable
suspicion,
because
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
situation
we
are
in
fact
looking
at
a
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
i
don't
acknowledge
that.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
if
i
did,
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
there
is
that
firearm
in
that
situation,
and
in
a
particularly
described
situation,
not
in
a
situation
where
you
would,
say,
get
a
tip
that
there
is
100
people
on
the
corner
all
wearing
plaid
shirts,
and
one
of
those
individuals
has
a
firearm.
that
would
be
the
firearm
exception,
if
the
officer
then
could
go
and
search
each
and
every
one
of
the
individuals.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
do
not
believe
at
that
point
in
time
the
public
safety,
or
the
officer's
safety
would
be
affected,
and
therefore
we
would
have
to
wait
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
the--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--correct,
but
once
he
goes
there,
what
is
the
officer
supposed
to
do
at
that
point
in
time,
and
that's
where
the--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
in
that
situation
what
would
be
proper
police...
it
might
not
be
what
is
under
the
case
law,
but
what
would
be
proper
police
investigation
in
that
situation,
and
you
would
have
to
give
the
officer's
experience,
and
the...
based
upon
the
neighborhood,
the
area--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no.
in
that
situation,
once
again
the
tip
is
the
knowledge
that
there
are
drugs,
or
the
idea
that
there
might
be
drugs
present,
and
i
believe
that
the
requirement
there
is
to
wait
until
there
is
actual
sale
or
use
of
the
drugs,
and
then
you
have
the
probable
cause--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
the
first
thing
is
that
the
tip
would
have
come
in,
and
an
officer
getting
a
tip
of
that
nature
would
have
surmised
that
the
person
had
seen
the
individuals,
where
they
were
located,
described
them,
and
had
seen
the
gun,
and
therefore,
without
the
drugs
being
involved...
and
the
tip
would
have
said
the
gun,
and
that's
the
difference.
in
the
other
situation
your
honor
gives
us,
we
don't
know
that
there
are
drugs.
we're
using
the
basic
surmise
of
the
officer
that
there
could
be
a
gun,
but
the
information
that
was
gotten
was
the
drugs,
and
that
is
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--correct,
your
honor.
in
that
situation,
that's
why
we
say
the
officer/public
safety,
because
if
the
officer
does
not
act,
then
the
individual--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--there
is
a
privilege
that
if
they
go
through
the
permitting--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no,
but
we
can--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--it's
a
presumption
that
they
legally
got
the
gun,
but
not
a
presumption
that
they
will
legally
use
the
gun.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
right.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
uh-huh.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
that's
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said
would
be
helpful,
and
you
put
the
officer--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
terry
normally...
terry
holds
exactly
that.
you
have
to
have
evidence
of
criminal
activity,
and
then
during
that
stop,
if
you
are
afraid
of
safety--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
exactly.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
that's
what
makes
it
a
different
situation
in
terms
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
officer
is
going
to
investigate
this
alleged
crime
of
carrying
a
concealed
firearm,
and
he
goes
up
and
speaks
to
the
individual.
there
is
a
distinct
possibility
that
when
he
says,
do
you
have
a
gun,
the
gun
will
be
exhibited
and
used,
and
therefore
this
is
different.
therefore,
there
is
a
concomitant
need
to
both
stop
and
frisk
immediately.
it
is
an
unusual
circumstance.
it
is
not
the
rule.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the
record
was
not...
if
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
how
clear
the
record
is
on
the
sequence
of
events.
i
would
say
that
if
those
frisks
occurred
first,
they
probably
were
not
proper,
because
they
were
not
the
ones
who
were
said
to
have
the
gun.
i
think
once
they
found
the
gun,
i
believe
it
was
proper.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
public
safety
exception,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
no--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--i
believe
that
the
reason
was
to
interrogate,
but
because
of
the
evidence
of
the
criminality,
was
he
carrying
a
concealed
firearm,
we
are
put
in
a
different
situation,
that
to
interrogate
before
you
ascertain
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed
puts
the
police
officer
in
harm's
way
at
that
time,
and
if
you
fail
to
do
the
interrogation
you
place
the
public
safety
in
harm's
way,
because
you
do
not
know
when
that
individual
might
take
out
the
gun
and
start
using
it.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
thank
you.
the
questions
concerning
the
bomb
really
underscore
the
duality
of
the
issues
in
front
of
the
court.
the
first
issue
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
said
an
anonymous
tip
could
never
be
enough,
and
clearly,
with
the
bomb
situation
it
would
have
to
be
enough.
there's
too
much
public
safety
involved.
the
second
question
then
becomes,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
were
the
facts
sufficient
to
allow
the
stop
and
frisk
under
the
situation?
in
this
situation,
because
it
was
a
juvenile...
there
is
a
problem
in
florida
with
juveniles
and
hand
guns...
the
tip
was
immediately
corroborated,
these
individuals
were
at
the
exact
location,
dressed
accordingly,
within
6
minutes.
then
what
were
the
officers
supposed
to
do
under
those
circumstances?
the
officer
could
have
waited
and
put
the
public
safety
in
jeopardy,
or
could
have
gone
to
investigate.
if
he
investigated
he
would
have
put
his
life
in
jeopardy
by
not
immediately
frisking
the
individual,
and
that
is
why
in
this
case,
on
the
factual
situation
the
state
submits
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
wrong,
if,
in
fact,
on
the
law
they
were
wrong
as
well.
as
to
the
question
of
the
22-year-old
in
florida,
because
an
individual
has
only
a
privilege
to
carry
a
concealed
firearm,
there
really
is
no
problem
with
an
officer
if
there
is
a
tip
that
an
individual
is
carrying
a
concealed
firearm
who
is
22,
or
even
older,
to
come
up
to
that
individual
and
ask
for
the
permit.
but
before
you
ask
for
the
permit,
if
you
ask
somebody
for
a
gun,
just
because
they're
legally
carrying
the
gun,
that
doesn't
mean
they're
going
to
legally
use
the
gun
and
therefore,
again,
even
in
that
situation
the
public
safety,
the
officer's
safety
in
ascertaining
whether
or
not
the
individual
has
a
permit
to
carry
that
gun
would
allow
the
immediate
frisk
upon
the
stop,
and
then
the
interrogation
occurs.
and
upon
the
interrogation,
do
you
have
a
permit,
yes,
i
do,
here
it
is,
thank
you
very
much,
here's
your
gun,
and
the
stop
as
a
terry
stop
should
be
as
limited
because
the
criminal
activity,
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
was
dispelled,
and
that's
the
dispelling
point
of
it
in
this
type
of
situation.
