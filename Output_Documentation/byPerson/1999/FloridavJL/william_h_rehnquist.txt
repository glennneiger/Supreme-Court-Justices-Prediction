chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
98-1993,
florida
v.
j.l.--
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
leave
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
neimand.
is
it
neimand,
or
neimand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neimand.
mr.
neimand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
unlawful
for
a
minor,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
person
was
a
minor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
could
be
true
of
a
tip
that
the
person
was
carrying
drugs.
your
argument
here
is
that
it's
much
more
dangerous
to
society
if
this
person
is
not
picked
up,
he
could
do
more
harm
with
a
gun
than
he
could
with
a
cache
of
drugs,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
your
public
safety
argument,
as
i
understand
it
you're
not
arguing
just
for
the
safety
of
the
policeman,
but
that
more
damage
can
result
to
some
member
of
the
public
in
a
confrontation
with
somebody
with
a
gun
than
a
confrontation
with
somebody
who
has
a
cache
of
drugs,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
reached
a
different
result
in
adams
v.
williams,
did
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
they
said,
connecticut
you
could
carry
with
a
permit--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
we
said
that
a
frisk
was
nonetheless
justified.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
neimand.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
sepler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
petitioner's
position
is
correct,
that
would
follow,
would
it
not,
that
with
a
gun
in
the
guy's
pocket,
as
they
believed,
to
ask
a
bunch
of
questions
is
not
going
to
obviate
any
public
safety
concern.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
there
was
suspicion
that
this
juvenile
was
carrying
the
gun
illegally
because
juveniles
aren't
allowed
to
carry
concealed
weapons
in
florida,
there
is
a
difference,
then,
between
this
case
and
someone
who
was,
say,
35
years
old.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay.
you
say
the
transcript
is
very
sparse,
and
i
agree
with
you,
but
here
the
individual
turns
out
to
be
under
16,
and
i
think
it's
a
fair
inference
that
a
person,
a
police
officer
looking
at
someone
under
16,
without
knowing
it,
can
say
this
person
is
under
21.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
your
suppression
hearing,
too.
i
mean,
in
a
sense,
you
had
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed,
and
if
you
want
to
cross-examine
her
and
say,
did
you
really
think
this...
make
any
determination
about
this
person's
age,
you
could
have
done
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
the
alabama
v.
white--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
says
the
other
circumstances,
other
than
the
anonymous
tip
were
not
enough,
but
coupled
with
the
anonymous
tip,
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
perhaps
you
missed
my
point
with
respect
to
alabama.
that
was
exactly
the
analysis
of
the
court
in
alabama
v.
white,
that
without
the
tip,
what
the
officer
did
and
saw
would
not
be
sufficient.
with
the
tip,
it
was,
so
the
fact
that
an
officer
standing
on
the
street
corner
here
could
have
seen,
without
the
tip,
and
still
couldn't
have
done
anything,
really
is
not
any
inconsistency
at
all.
it's
quite
consistent
with
our
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sepler.
mr.
neimand,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
neimand.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-1993,
florida
versus
j.
l.
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
