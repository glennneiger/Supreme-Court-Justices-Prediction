mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the...
one
of
the
first
questions
that
was
asked
is
the
most
critical.
this
is
alabama
v.
white,
but
without
the
predictive
features.
the
state
conceded
it,
the
solicitor
general
conceded
it.
the
only
justification
that
i
can
see
in
the
state's
argument
for
upholding
the
stop
and
frisk
is
that
an
anonymous
tipster
alleged
the
presence
of
a
firearm,
but
that,
of
course,
doesn't
make
the
tip
any
more
reliable,
and
it
doesn't
lower
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
in
terry
v.
ohio,
this
court
said
that
where
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
is
engaged
in
criminality,
the
officers
can
stop,
and
that
where
there
is
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
individual
is
armed
and
presently
dangerous...
and
presently
dangerous...
then
the
officer
can
conduct
a
frisk.
there
were
three...
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
three
components
to
the
terry
holding
that
i
think
are
very,
very
relevant
to
this
case:
first
of
all,
that
a
pat-down
is
not
a
minimal
intrusion.
second
of
all,
that
the
limitation
placed
on
terry
is,
where
there's
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
threat
is
of
an
individual
that
is
armed
and
presently
dangerous.
this
is
to
an
actual
and
immediate
threat,
not
a
possible
or
a
potential
one.
and
the
third
is...
and
this
i
think
is
very,
very
important.
i'm
not
sure
it's
been
touched
on
adequately
to
this
point...
is
that
before
the
officer
may
begin
the
pat-down,
the
officer
must
give
the
individual
an
opportunity
to
dispel
any
safety
concerns.
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was
no
opportunity
given.
the
officer
came
up
and
didn't
ask
any
questions,
didn't
conduct
any
type
of
investigation,
just
went
right
to
the
frisk.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
it
is
correct,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
the
state's
proposal
were
adopted,
yes,
at
that
point
the
officers
would
be
entitled
to
move
directly
to
the
frisk,
and
they
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything
else,
but
of
course,
that
proposal
depends,
number
1,
on
the
tip
being
a
reliable
tip,
which,
of
course,
there
is
no
showing
here,
that
also--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--and
this
is
why.
if
the
statute
were
to
say--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--if
the
statute,
your
honor,
were
to
say
that
young
people
couldn't
possess
guns,
then
i
think
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
no.
under
florida
law,
individuals
may
possess
weapons
for
a
limited
purpose,
but
in
terms
of
having
a
license
to
carry
a
concealed
firearm,
21
is
the
limit.
however,
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was
no
tip
that
said--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--no,
not--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--it
is
not
lawful.
in
order
to
have
a--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--your
honor,
if
i
may
answer
you
this
way.
if
the
officer
were
to
have
gone
to
the
street
corner,
with
a
tip
that
said
young,
and
said...
and
testified
to
this,
and
i
must
tell
you,
as
you
have
no
doubt
noticed,
that
the
transcript
in
this
case
is
very,
very
small.
if
the
officer
would
have
gone
and
said,
i
have
a
tip
of
a
young
individual
on
a
corner,
and
went
there,
and
the
officer
had
testified,
i
looked
at
this
individual
and
he
looked
less
than
21,
he
looked
younger
than
21,
our
position
might
be
different.
but
of
course,
that
didn't
happen.
young
is
a
variable
term.
i
think
webster's
third
world
dictionary
defines
young
as
more...
as...
well...
i'm
sorry,
i
was--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--okay.
[laughter]
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
well--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
it
may
go,
if
i
may,
to...
as
i
understood
the
court's
question,
it
may
go
to
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion,
independent
of
the
tip,
and
the
tip
may
have
provided
a...
arguably
may
have
provided
a
context
for
what
the
officer
sees
at
the
scene.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
i
understand
you.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
well,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
one
could
envision
situations
that
are
increasingly
more
difficult
to
analyze.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
it,
your
honor.
in
no
sense
did
i
concede
that
a
bomb
is
different.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
well--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--no.
the
answer's
a
difficult
question,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say
that
in
general
terms
the
answer
is
no,
and
what
i'm
suggesting...
of
course,
i
understand
that
these
are
difficult
questions,
and--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--let
me
suggest
both
questions...
i
understand
that
one
can
conceive
of
very
difficult
questions
that--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--well,
my
answer,
your
honor--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--yes,
thank
you,
your
honor.
my
answer
is
is
that
in
very
limited
circumstances,
where
there
is
an
actual
and
immediate
danger,
and
where
the
danger
is
so
extreme
that
it
constitutes
an
extreme
public
emergency,
in
those
situations
i
would
suggest
that
in
those
situations
reasonable
suspicion
might
bend,
but
those
are
in
a
very,
very
limited
and
narrow
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
i
believe
you
do
not,
and
here
is
why.
here
is
the
analysis
at
least
that
seems
to
be
at
least
most
comfortable
to
me,
and
i
would...
in
preparing
for
the
bomb
question,
because
it
is
a
very
obvious
question
one
might
answer.
i
might
say
that
first
of
all,
if
the
tip
were
based...
i'm
sorry,
if
the
belief
of
a
bomb
is
based
on
a
tip,
my
first...
the
first
thing
that
an
officer
needs
to
do
is,
is
this
a
reliable
tip?
does
it
meet
all
the
other
requirements?
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
all
right.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
yes,
your
honor.
if
it
is
a
reliable...
if
it
is
not...
if
it's
an
anonymous
tip,
then
the
next
thing
that
i
believe
a
police
officer
ought
to
do
is,
is
there
any
kind
of
independent
police
work
that
i
can
do
to
either
corroborate
what
i've
heard
in
this
tip,
or
find
something
other
than
that
that's
suspicious?
if
there's
not
any
other
corroborating
information
that
i
can...
i
need
to
make
an
on-the-spot
determination
whether
this
is
an
actual
and
immediate
threat.
there
are
a
lot
of
bomb
tips
that
come
into
police
stations.
police
have...
they
do
need
to
make
distinctions,
discriminations
as
to
which
tips
present
an
actual
and
immediate
one,
versus
where
is
there
a
potential--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--i
think
under
a
totality
of
circumstances
approach.
it's
what's
in
the
tip.
if
the
tip
were
that
there's
a
bomb
here
and
it's
going
to
go
off
at
some
time
before
12:00,
well,
then
there's
an
opportunity
to
make
this
investigation.
our
case,
of
course,
asks
whether
there's--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
general
terms
ought
not
to
reduce
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
in
general
terms,
i
would
say
no,
unless
the
officers
make
an
on-the-spot
determination
that
based
on
their
experience
there
is
an
actual
and
immediate
threat.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
then
if
there's
not...
if
they
cannot
make
a
determination
that
there's
an
actual
and
immediate
threat
there,
then
i
would
answer
your
question
no.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
again,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
generally
no.
if
the
police
have...
believe
that
there's
an
actual
and
immediate
threat,
they
may
be
entitled
to
do
that.
that's
not
the
situation
here,
of
course.
here,
what
we
have
is,
we
have
individuals
who
were
doing
absolutely
nothing.
absolutely
nothing.
the
officer
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
the...
in
so
many
words
that
the
only
reason
that
she
stopped
these
boys
were
because
they
were
standing
next
to
a
bus
stop.
for
all
we
know,
they
could
have
been
waiting
for
a
bus.
and
the
argument
that's
made
by
the
state
is
not
limited
to
juveniles,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
even
if
it
was
limited
to
juveniles,
because
we
don't
have
enough
here
to
even
suggest
that
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
believed
these
were
juveniles.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
the
only...
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
difference
would
be
if
the
officer
were
to
have
testified,
i
looked
at
this
individual,
i
could
tell
that
this
individual
was
a
juvenile,
and
i
could
tell
that
this
individual--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--didn't
fit
within
one
of
the
exceptions
for
a
juvenile.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
with
all
respect,
i
would
not
be
as
readily
to
make
that
inference.
we
don't
know
what
this
respondent
looked
like.
again,
the
officer
could
have
easily
testified
to
that,
and
she
didn't,
and
i
don't
know...
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
fairly
read
into
the
record
that
by
looking
at
this
individual
she
could
tell
that
he
was
a
juvenile.
i
think
we
are
bound
by
what
we
are
given,
and
what
we
are
given
is
alabama
v.
white,
with
no
predictive
elements.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
our
responsibility,
as
i
understand
it,
under
a
motion
to
suppress
is
to
bring
forth
the
arguments
that
this
was
not
a
lawful
stop
and
frisk.
the
state
at
that
point
had
every
opportunity
to
show
that
it
was
a
lawful
one.
this
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
semantics.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
very
important
case,
because--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--and
your
honor,
that's
why
i
preface
this
with,
there
are
hypotheticals
that
one
could
come
up
which
make--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--and
i
believe
the
answer
was
in
terry.
the
answer
is,
whether
there
is
an
actual
and
immediate
threat.
where
there's
an
actual
and
immediate
threat,
this
court
under
terry
and
the
cases
that
have
relied
upon
terry
have
said
that
at
that
point,
the
officers
are
authorized
to
do
what
they
need
to
do.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
your
analysis
changes
at
all
from
where
it
is
now.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
i
would
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
has
even
less,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
this.
this
court
has
said
in
adams
that
where
there's
a
tip
from
a
known
informant
who
is
subject
to
state
laws
for
filing
false
complaints,
it
adds
a
degree,
a
special
degree
of
reliability.
this
court
has
also
held
that
where
there
is
sufficient
meaningful
corroboration
to
the
tip,
that
also
adds
a
special...
lends
a
special
degree
of
familiarity.
here,
we
have
none
of
that.
this
is
an
anonymous
tipster.
there
is
no
way
for
an
individual
to
trace
the
tipster,
or
no
way
for
the
police
to
trace
the
tipster.
there's
nothing
about
the
details
that
were
in
this
tip,
other
than
a
bald
allegation
of
the
presence
of
a
gun,
that
would
in
any
way
allow
for
the
police
officer,
or
a
court
reviewing
this,
to
make
a
determination
of
a
meaningful
corroboration.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
in
general,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
analysis
has
been
established
if
the
tip
is
not
inherently
reliable,
it
must
give
enough
information
to
allow
for
a
meaningful
corroboration.
now,
i
would
suggest
also
that--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--certainly
that
is
one
of
the
concerns.
we--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--we
have
cited
in
our
brief
one
estimate
that
shows
that
90
percent
of
the
tips
are
unreliable,
anonymous
tips.
let
me
suggest
to
the
court,
whether
the
figure
is
90
percent
or
80
percent,
or
70--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
there
is
nothing
on
the
other...
and
this
is...
this
is
a,
i
believe,
your
honors,
is
a
very
fundamental
case,
because
it's
going...
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
relationship
between
police
and
citizens
in
a
free
society.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
i
believe
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
answered
judge...
justice
breyer's
question
in
general.
i
think
that
that's
absolutely
correct.
one
could
envision
that
if
the
state's
proposal
were
adopted
you're
going
to
have
situations,
or
we
are
all
going
to
have
situations
where
in
a
child
custody
case
an
embittered
spouse
seeks
to
seek
an
advantage
over
the
other
spouse
and
calls
in
a
tip.
employees
who
have
a
grudge
against
employers
are
going
to
call
in
a
tip.
you're
going
to
have
even...
you're
going
to
even
have
lawyers
who
get
an
adverse
ruling
call
in
a
tip.
there
is
nothing
about
this
tip
that
distinguishes
not
only
these
individuals,
but
distinguishes
the
tipster
to
show
that
the
tipster
bears
a
particular
familiarity
with
the
individuals.
generally,
as
this
court
knows,
the
law
is
that
the
tipster
has
to
know
something.
he's
got
to
know
something
about
the
suspect,
or
about
the
crime,
that
would
allow
the
police
officer
to
believe,
well,
he
knows
something
more.
but
here
what
you
have
is,
you
have
an
individual,
we
don't
know...
the
individual
could
have
been
another
child.
there's
nothing
to
say
who
this
person
is,
and
to
adopt
a
rule
that
says
the
bald
assertion
that
somebody's
got
a
gun
is
going
to
allow
police,
unhampered,
to
stop
and
frisk
anybody,
anywhere,
at
any
time,
is
just
too
much.
we
need
to
hold
tipsters
accountable.
you
need
to
hold
police
accountable.
this
is
a
very
important
case,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
that's--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--that's
certainly
one
of
the
more
troubling
implications.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
i'm
not--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
i
think
it's
absolutely
true,
i
mean,
there
are
certainly
problems,
and
we're
not
relying
on
this,
but
it
is
an
implication
of
the
case.
certainly
we've
cited
to
instances
in
los
angeles,
new
york,
detroit,
philadelphia,
where
police
fabrication
has
now
been
called
into
serious
question.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
is
going
to
happen,
but
it
is
also
true
from
a
common
sense
perspective
that
if
this
proposal
were
adopted,
tips
that
now
come
into
police
stations
and
you
want
immediate
action,
all
you've
got
to
say
is,
he's
got
a
gun,
and
the
police
are
going
to
be
right
there,
and
they're
going
to
be
authorized
to
make
a
stop
and
make
a
frisk,
on
the
same
basis.
and
it's
rather
ironic,
your
honors,
that
if
the
same
information,
if
the
police
officer
had
have
been
on
the
street
corner,
and
seen
the
respondent
looking
exactly
the
way
the
tipster
said
he
was
going
to
look,
and
saw
him
and
said,
based
on
my
30
years
experience,
that
person
looks
like
he's
up
to
no
good.
he
looks
like
he's
going
to
commit
a
crime,
and
he
looks
like
he's
armed
and
dangerous,
that
under
this
court's
law
that
officer
would
not
be
entitled
to
move
in
on
that
hunch.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
that's--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--in
alabama
v.
white,
as
i
understand
it,
the
critical
factor
in
making
the
determination
was
that
there
was
corroboration
of
predictive
features
of
the
tip,
and
that
absent
those
predictive
features,
and
absent
the
corroboration
of
those
predictive
features,
the
tip
in
alabama
v.
white
would
not
have
been
sufficient.
but
again,
if
the
officer
had
a
hunch,
based
on
his
or
her
30
years
experience,
and
seen
the
very
same
things
that
were
in...
that
were
named
in
the
tip,
the
officer
would
not
be
entitled
to
make
that
stop
and
frisk.
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
your
honor,
again,
as
i...
and
i
hope
i'm
answering
your
question
directly...
as
i
understand
white,
it
was
yes,
that
there
was
a
tip,
but
it
was
the
corroboration
of
the
predictive
features
in
the
tip
that
made
all
the
difference.
if
the
tip
didn't
have
any
predictive
features,
then
even
though
there
was
a
tip,
and
even
though
there
was
corroboration
of
details
of
identification,
this
court
in
white
found
that
to
be
insufficient.
that--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--i
agree,
your
honor--
mr.
harvey
j.
sepler
--as
i
understand
the
predictive
features,
you
predict
conduct.
as...
well,
of
course,
wardlow
didn't
have
conduct,
but
if...
but
it's
the
conduct
that
is
the
most
critical.
if
the
person
said
he's
going
to...
on
the
street
corner
and
he's
going
to
catch
the
number
4
bus,
well,
that
would
be
all
the
difference.
if
he's
standing
there
and
he's
not
doing
anything,
you
have
no
predictive
features
of
anything
to
corroborate,
and
absent
those
predictive
features,
i
think
what
you
have
in
all
seriousness
is,
you
do
have
a
situation
where
anybody,
anywhere,
could
be
stopped
for
nothing
more
than
casual
observation.
this
court
said
in
white
that
in
order
to
allow
for
meaningful
corroboration,
there
has
to
be
that
something
more.
the
tip
has
to
be
as
to
facts
or
events
of
things
that
are
not
occurring
at
the
time
that
the
tip
was
made,
as
to
things
that
are
not
available
by
casual
observation
or
rumor
or
reputation.
and
then,
of
course,
the
court
went
on
to
the
meaningful
corroboration,
and
it
used
the
predictive
elements
to
provide
that
meaningful
corroboration.
in
this
sense,
everything
that
was
in
that
tip
were
things
that
were
occurring
at
the
time
that
the
tip
was
made,
everything
in
that
tip
were
things
that
were
available
by
casual
observation,
by
somebody
who
just
saw
these
guys
and
didn't
like
them,
just
didn't
like
them.
i
don't
want
these
gentlemen
in
my
neighborhood
so
i'm
going
to
call
in
a
tip.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
or
even
suggest
that
this
was
a
high
crime
area.
there's
absolutely
nothing
to
show
that
these
gentlemen
made
any
furtive
movements,
that
they
ran
from
police.
the
typical
situation
again
is
that
the
police
come
up
and
they
confront
somebody,
and
if
they
sweat,
if
they
gave
evasive
answers,
if
they
make
furtive
movements,
if
they
run,
that's
the
typical
situation
where
a
tip
which
has
only
details
of
identification
might
be
sufficient.
in
this
case,
there
wasn't
any
of
that,
and
the
state's
not
even
suggesting
that
there
ought
to
be.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
that
if
there
is
a
bald
tip
with
a
naked
assertion,
that's
enough,
and
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
white
and
under
adams
v.
williams,
illinois
v.
gates,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
there
has
to
be
a
meaningful
corroboration.
thank
you,
your
honors.
