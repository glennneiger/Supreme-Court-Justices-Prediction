mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
officer
may
conduct
a
stop
and
frisk
when,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
crime
is
occurring
and
that
the
suspect
is
armed
and
dangerous.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
reasonable
suspicion
is,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
met
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
consists
of
the
following
four
things:
the
tip,
the
confirmation
of
the
verifiable
details
of
the
tip,
the
absence
of
any
observations
that
led
the
officer
to
conclude
that
there
was...
that
his
suspicions
should
not
be
aroused
when
he
got
to
the
scene,
and
the
fact
that
this
tip
concerned
a
gun
that
was
unlawful
for
a
child
to
possess,
and
therefore
the
level
of
suspicion
that
you
need
in--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--this...
the
law
of
florida
is
that
anyone
under
21
cannot
carry
a
gun,
and
this
person
was
under
16
years
of
age,
so
any
officer
who
came
to
the
scene
and
observed
that
person
would
have
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
that
was
a
child
there.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
don't
have
any
empirical
evidence
on
this,
and
when
you're
presented
with
a
tip
like
this,
i
think
what
you
resort
to
is
a
common
sense
judgment
that
if
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
tip
that
is
unreliable,
the
officer
is
going
to
go
out
to
the
scene.
once
he's
at
the
scene,
and
he
confirms
the
observable
details,
and
nothing
decreases
his
suspicion,
then
the
alternatives
to
a
stop-and-frisk
pose
an
unreasonable
risk
of
danger
to
the
police
and
the
public.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does...
it
does--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
would.
it
would
make
the
tip
more
reliable,
and
that
would
be
a
factor
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
if
it
could
be
shown
that
it
was
a
911
call
that
you
could
record,
that
you
knew
where
the
call
came
from.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
said,
i
believe...
the
testimony
is
at
a-41,
and
this
is
the
only
thing
on
it,
and
the
officer
says,
i
believe
they
stated
they
were
young,
referring
to
the
tipster.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's
because--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
would
have
to
be
combined
with
general
knowledge
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--of...
justice
scalia,
of
the
public,
that
they
could
potentially--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
there
are
varying
degrees
of
anonymity,
but
i
would
accept
your
basic
point
that
unless
the
person...
it's
generally
known
that
caller
id
is
out
there,
that
it
doesn't
weigh
into
the
calculus
that
much.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
because
alabama--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
would
say
that
it
would
be
the
degree
of
suspicion
that
we
call
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
cases
haven't
specifically
addressed
this
particular
factor,
but
that's
because
the
issue
hasn't
been
put
to
the
court.
this
is
the
first
time
the
case
is...
the
issue
is
being
put
to
the
court
that
the
degree
of
danger
weighs
into
whether
it
constitutes
reasonable
suspicion
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
no,
and
the
reason
is
that
probable
cause
is
constitutional
text
that
has
a
meaning
that
must
be
drawn
from
its
history
and
from
its
early
application,
and
that
kind
of
sliding
scale
approach
does
not
apply
in
a
probable
cause,
but
what
we
are--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
what
it
is
interpreting
is
the
general
reasonableness
requirement,
and
the
way
the
court
formulated
that
reasonableness
requirement
in
terry
is
that
you
look
at
what
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
would
consider
appropriate
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
would
necessarily
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
tip
concerns
something
that
poses
an
immediate
danger
of
violence.
if
the
tip
is
about
somebody
at
a
courthouse
with
a
bomb,
or
somebody
at
a
school
with
an
automatic
weapon,
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
is
going
to
operate
on
somewhat
less
suspicion
than
otherwise
in
deciding
whether
to
make
a
stop
and
frisk.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it
depends
on
whether
the
carrying
of
the
weapon
is...
you
would
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
it
was
illegal
to
carry
the
weapon,
and
in
florida,
if
somebody
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
then
if
you--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
you
identify
the
person
with
sufficient
specificity
so
that
when
the
officer
comes
to
the
scene
and
confirms
the
observable
details
of
the
tip,
and
there's
nothing
else
in
his
observations
that
decreases
his
level
of
suspicion,
then
the
reasonable
and
prudent
course
is
to
stop
and
frisk,
because
the
alternatives
to
the
stop
and
frisk
are...
create
real
danger
to
the
police
and
the
public.
if
the
police
approaches
the
person,
he
runs
a
risk
of
getting
shot.
if
he
waits
and
see
if
the
gun
is
pulled
out,
that
person
might
shoot
somebody,
and
it's
that
real
risk
of
danger--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is...
well,
i
would
say
that
it
is
critical
in
this
case
that
there
be
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
does
not
have
a
license,
and
that's
furnished
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
there's
reasonable
suspicion
that
he's
under
21
years
of
age.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
would
need
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--my
only
hesitation
in
saying
no,
he
couldn't
justice
stevens,
is
there
are
places
like
new
york
city
and
the
district
of--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
would
say
no,
except...
and
if
i
could
just
finish
the
answer,
the
difference
is
that
there
are
some
places
where
there
are
many
guns
and
very
few
licenses,
and
if
florida
was
such
a
place,
or
this
particular
area
were
such
a
place,
like
the
district
of
columbia
or
new
york
city,
where
there
are
an
extraordinary
number
of
guns
and
an
extremely
limited
number
of
licenses...
only,
say,
private
detectives
really
have
them...
then
there
would
still
be
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
otherwise,
no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
don't
have...
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
facts
in
florida.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
that
is
a
possible
inference
to
draw,
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
because
in
places
where
guns
are
widely
carried
and
legally
so,
some
people
may
not
know
about
that,
and
so
the
tip
may
just
be
that
the
person
observed
a
gun
and
it
was
frightening
to
them,
but
i
take
your
point
that
that
is
one
possible
reasonable
inference
that
an
officer
could
draw,
and
based
on...
if
the
officer's
experience
was
that
this
was
so,
then
that
would
figure
into
the
totally
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
on
a-41,
in
the
middle,
i
believe
they
stated
they
were
young,
and
so
the
tip
alerted
the
officer
to
the
possibility
that
this
was
somebody
under
21
years
of
age,
and
when
the
officer
got
to
the
scene
and
saw
somebody
shy
of
16
years
old,
they
certainly
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
was
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
in
violation
of
florida
law.
