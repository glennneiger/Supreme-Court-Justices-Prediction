justice
john
paul
stevens
the
red
brief
says
that
you
in
effect
are
arguing
for
a
gun
exception
to
the
anonymous
tip
rule,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
red
brief
is
in
essence
fair
when
it
characterizes
your
argument
that
way,
because
i
think
what
you're
telling
us
that
the
nature
of
the
tip,
i.e.,
that
there
is
a
gun,
somehow
makes
the
tip
more
reliable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
one
thing
i
don't
understand.
at
the
very
beginning
i
think
you
said
that
it's
perfectly
all
right
in
florida,
unless
you're
a
juvenile...
and
i
don't
know
how
this
officer
knew
this
young
person
was
a
juvenile
based
on
the
tip,
but
except
for
juveniles,
is
it
not
lawful
for
persons
in
florida
to
carry
concealed
weapons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
mere
fact
that
you
suspect
someone
of
having
a
gun
doesn't
mean
he
doesn't
have
that
privilege,
he
doesn't
have
a
permit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
that
it's
more
jeopardy
if
you
say
they're
a
drug
dealer,
because
that's
definitely
illegal,
but
if
you
just
say
he's
got
a
gun,
well,
you
presume
that
the
person
obeys
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
about
the
tips
for
a
moment?
do
you
have
any
information
that
we
can
consult
as
to
whether
or
not
the
great
majority
of
tips
in
gun
cases
are
correct
or
incorrect?
our
jurisprudence
is
such
that
we
fear
tips
because
of
pranks
and
people
who
have
vendettas,
and
the
assumption
is,
is
that
they
are
usually
unreliable.
can
you
tell
us
anything
to
bear
on
this?
are
tips
about
guns
generally
reliable,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
police
have
the
name
of
the...
the
capacity
to
check
the
number
from
which
the
call
originated,
does
that
make
the
tip
perhaps
more
reliable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
a
crime
to
violate...
to
have
a
false
report
under
911,
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
therefore
critical
to
your
position
that
they
realize
this
was
a
young
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
he
had
not
been
under
21,
you
would
agree
that
the
stop
would
have
been
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
on
the
facts
of
this...
say
precisely
the
same
facts,
except
he
called
him
and
said,
my
cousin
who
is
22
is
over
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he
have
made
the
stop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
we've
got...
we've
got
a
place
in
this
particular
case,
a
bus
stop,
three
young...
three
men,
22
years
old,
one
of
them
wearing
a
plaid
shirt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
still
asking
about
florida,
and
you
would
agree,
in
florida
he
could
not
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
need
to
belabor
that
point
to
this
bench.
