in
a
sense,
it
seems
to
me
a
tip
from
an
outside
source
made
to
a
police
dispatcher
has
somewhat
more
authenticity
than
perhaps
our
earlier
cases
have
indicated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
based
on
the
assumption
that
most
anonymous
tips
are
unfounded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
evidence
of
that
either
way.
justice
anthony

kennedy
that
was
anecdotal
and
quite--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
the
other
hand,
i
agree
with
you.
i
see
nothing
on
the
other
side.
