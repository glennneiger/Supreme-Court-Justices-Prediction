justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
you
don't
need
as
much
reliability.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
is
not
that
the
tip
is
more
reliable.
it's
that
you
don't...
we
will
not
insist
upon
the
same
degree
of
reliability
when
the
argument
is
that
the
guy
has
a
gun.
maybe
even
less
for
an
atomic
bomb?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
my
question
is,
why
do
we
apply
this
principle
just
to
stop
and
frisk?
if
the
principle
is
a
valid
one,
shouldn't
it
apply
to
search
and
seizure
as
well,
so
that
we
shouldn't
really
insist
upon
the
same
degree
of
probable
cause
if
it
is
said
that
someone
has
an
arsenal
in
his
basement.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
mean,
the
degree
of
public
harm
is
enormous,
or,
you
know,
is
making
bombs...
now,
we
don't
do
that
for
search
and
seizures.
i
don't
see
why
there's
any
more
justification
for
doing
it
for
stop
and
frisk
than
there
is
for
doing
it
for
search
and
seizure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
not
to
conduct
a
search
on
the
basis
of
less
probable
cause
than
would
normally
be
necessary.
we
don't
say,
if
there's
a
really
serious
threat
to
the
public
involved
you
don't
need
the
same
degree
of
probable
cause.
we
haven't
said
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
principle
is
valid
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
apply
to
one
as
to
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
all
events--
--you're
getting
back
on
the
notion
that
i
thought
we
put
that
to
rest
and
don't
have
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again.
you
acknowledge
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
suspicion
is
reasonable
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
we've--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
neimand,
i
thought
a
frisk
in
stop
and
frisk,
a
frisk
is
incidental
to
the
stop.
what
we
said
is,
when
you
see
somebody
behaving
suspiciously,
what
the
policeman
is
authorized
to
do
is
to
stop
the
person
and
make
inquiry...
why
are
you
hanging
around
on
this
street
corner?
where
do
you
come
from?
why
are
you
here?
what's
your
name
+/?
make
inquiries
like
that.
now,
in
this
case,
by
contrast...
and
incidental
to
those
inquiries
he
has
to
protect
himself,
so
he
can
pat
the
person
down
before
making
the
inquiry.
that's
how
it
developed.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
the
whole
reason
for
the
policeman
going
up
to
this
person
is
to
frisk
him.
what
possible
question
was
he
going
to
ask
the
fellow
that
would
satisfy
him
that
in
fact
he
is
not
the
suspicious
character
that
he
had
reason
to
believe?
what's
he
going
to
ask
him?
do
you
have
a
gun
in
your
pocket?
is
that
going
to
be
very
helpful?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
helpful
at
all.
the
whole
purpose
of
his
going
up
is
to
frisk.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
quite
different
from
the
rationale
behind
our
stop-and-frisk
jurisprudence.
justice
antonin
scalia
during
the
stop
in
order--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
interrogate
the
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
what
possible
benefit
interrogation
would
have
had
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that's
absolutely
the
wrong
answer,
that
if,
indeed...
if,
indeed
he
was
frisking
for
the
proper
purpose,
that
is,
to
protect
himself,
he
had
just
as
much
reason
to
frisk
the
two
that
were
next
to
this
fellow
while
he
was
conducting
the
interrogation,
just
as
when
the
police
stop
a
car
on
reasonable
suspicion
they
can
frisk
not
just
the
driver,
but
other
people
in
the
car,
to
be
sure
that
they
are
not
endangered.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
he
shouldn't
frisk
all
three,
unless
i
believed,
as
you
apparently
do,
that
really
what
he
went
there
for
was
not
to
interrogate,
but
to
frisk.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
only
had
a
reason
to
frisk
the
person
against
whom
the
anonymous
tip
was
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
go
back
to
your
earlier
answer?
why
is
it...
the
fact
that
you
have
caller
id
makes
the
tip
more
reliable?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
caller
doesn't
know
that
you
have
caller
id?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
combined
with
a
very
stupid
caller
who
tries
to
be
anonymous
when
he
knows
that
he
can't
be
anonymous--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
he's
calling
from
his
own
phone
and
you
have
caller
id.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
mere
fact
that
he
remains
anonymous
and
doesn't
tell
you
his
name
indicates
that
he
believes
he
can
be
unknown
and
doesn't
want
to
be
known.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
probable
cause?
would
you
adopt
a
similar
sliding
scale
for
probable
cause,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
since
we
made
up
reasonable
suspicion
it's
totally--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unconnected
to
the
constitution,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
gornstein,
isn't
the
reasonable
implication
of
the
tip
that
he
is
carrying
a
gun
illegally?
do
you
call
up
the
cops
to
tell
them
that
somebody
is
carrying
a
gun
legally?
surely--
justice
antonin
scalia
surely,
the
reasonable
implication
of
the
tip
is
that
this
person
is
behaving
against
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
possible.
i
can't
imagine--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
can
i
ask
you
an
obvious--
--may
i
say
that
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
make
any
difference
in
the
world?
all
it
would
show
is
that
if
he
had
a
gun
it
would
be
unlawful.
it
would
make
no
difference
whatever
to
the
reliability
of
the
tip
that
he
had
a
gun.
it
would
just
go
to
whether,
if
he
did
have
it,
he
had
it
unlawfully.
i
don't
see
how
it
affects
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
basis
of
your
case
is
that
the
tip
was
not
reliable
enough,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
doesn't
go
at
all
to
the
reliability
of
the
tip.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
same
for
probable
cause.
i
mean,
suppose
they
say
the
bomb
is...
it's
a
big
bomb,
and
it's
in
his
locker,
it's
not
on
his
person,
so
even
if
you
did
a
stop-and-frisk
you
wouldn't
discover
it,
but
they
say,
this
guy
has
an
enormous
bomb.
it's
in
the
school
building
in
his
locker.
now,
could
you
go...
a
stop-and-frisk
won't
disclose
it.
do
you
have
probable
cause,
on
the
basis
of
this
anonymous
tip,
to
go
and
conduct
a
search
and
seizure
of
a
locker?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
we
distrust
policemen
enough
that
we
have
the
exclusionary
rule
in
order
to
deter
them
from
conducting
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
but
i
guess
it
would
be
pretty
neat
for
the
tipster
to
be
another
policeman.
all
you
have
to
do
is
allege
that
the
person
has
a
gun,
and
it
will
permit
a
search--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
body
search,
which
may
not
uncover
a
gun,
but
may
well
uncover
marijuana,
cocaine,
or
some
other
unlawful
contraband.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
under...
do
you
really
understand
this
predictive
features
fillip
on
the
doctrine?
i
mean,
suppose
the
tipsters
here
had
said,
there's
a
fellow
in
a
plaid
shirt
standing
on
the
corner,
and
he's
going
to
continue
to
stand
on
the
corner
for
2
more
hours,
would
that
be
enough?
i
don't
really
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
the
predictive
feature,
unless
it's,
there's
something
suspicious
in
the
predictive
feature--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i've
never
understood
that
about
the
case.
