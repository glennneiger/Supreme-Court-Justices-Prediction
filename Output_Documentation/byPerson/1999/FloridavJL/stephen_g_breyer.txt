it
doesn't
make
it
any
more
reliable
here,
does
it?
i
thought...
i
mean,
does
it
make
it
more
reliable?
it
certainly
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
keep
everything
else
the
same,
and
only
vary
the
gun
and
change
it
to
a
book
that's
copyrighted
unlawfully,
or
drugs,
marijuana,
or
some
other
thing.
then
i
take
it
you'd
say
there
wasn't
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
how
do
we
get
the
fact,
since
it's
supposed
to
be
reasonable
suspicion,
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot?
how
do
we
say
that
that
changes?
that
doesn't
change.
what
changes
is
the
degree
of
reasonable
suspicion
that
will
justify
the
stop,
or
this
frisk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
maybe
you
could
say
that,
then...
but
the
way
the
term
has
been
used
in
the
cases,
it
hasn't
been
said
suspicion
that
is
sufficiently
reasonable
to
justify
the
search.
rather,
it
said,
reasonable
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
doubt
that,
i
think,
in
the
cases
reasonable
suspicion
has
been
used
to
date
to
refer
to
reasonable
suspicion
that
crime
is
afoot,
and
they
have
a
number
of
circumstances
here
that
give
that
suspicion,
but
they
concede
that
on
the
ordinary
standard
i
think
it
wouldn't
meet
it,
as
so
far.
but
suppose
that
it
was
a
bomb
at
a
school.
i
mean,
i'm
testing
the
proposition
of
whether
that
word
reasonableness
varies,
at
least
sometimes,
in
light
just
not
of
the
suspicion
about
whether
the
person
has
the
bomb,
but
the
very
fact
that
it's
a
bomb.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
i
mean,
that's
the
obvious
question,
and
of
course,
that's
something
that
disturbs
me
the
most.
i
just
can't
believe
that
if
somebody
called
up,
described
the
person
in
detail,
said
he
has
a
bag,
and
moreover
he
has
thousands
of
pounds
of
bomb
material
in
that
bag
outside
the
courthouse
or
the
school,
i
can't
believe
that
the
police
shouldn't
go
and
find
out.
but
i
mean,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
once
you
say
that,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
a
gun
is
or
is
not
enough
like
a
bomb
to
warrant
the
variance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
you
think
about
the
bomb?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
i
wanted
you
to
see
the
point
of
the
question.
if
it's
a
bomb
about...
and
they
call
up,
you
know,
big
bomb,
in
a
bag,
same
amount
of...
in
fact,
less
belief,
really,
because
people
don't
normally
carry
bombs
in
bags,
but
they
say
that...
you
see
the
point.
clear
description
of
the
person.
clear
description
of
the
bag.
within
5
minutes
they
go
to
the
place,
and
there
somebody
who
meets
a
detailed
description
is
standing
there
with
precisely
the
bag.
can
the
police
open
the
bag?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but--
--i
think
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
saying
that
a
gun
is
not
as
serious
as
a
bomb.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
yes,
but
i'm
still
disturbed
about
the
bomb
and
the
reason
is,
you
vacillated
a
little,
or...
i
think
between...
one,
i
could
saying,
well,
there's
an
across-the-board
public
safety
exception
from
probable
cause
and
the
other
things.
of
course
if
there's
an
atomic
bomb
they're
going
to
look,
and
they
should,
so
there's
an
exception,
rarely
invoked,
for
public
safety
of
extreme
sorts.
you
take
that
tack,
then
you've
got
to
at
least
say,
well,
what
about
guns
in
schools.
if
you
don't
take
that
tack,
and
just
say
you
can
vary
the
reasonable
suspicion
for
bombs,
then
you've
got
to
explain
why
at
least
guns
in
schools
is
somehow
different
from
a
bomb
in
a
school.
i
mean,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
do
one
or
the
other,
or
you
have
to
take
the
absolute
position,
no,
no
even
a
bomb,
not
even
the
atomic
bomb,
et
cetera.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
taking
one
of
those
three
positions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
purely
hypothetical.
what's
disturbing
me
about
the
case
is,
i
don't
know
exactly
what
to
analogize
guns
to.
should
i
try
to
distinguish
between
guns
at
a
bus
stop
and
guns
at
a
school?
should
i
try
to
start
distinguishing
between
guns
and
bombs
in
the
latter
case?
how
do
i
deal
with
it?
that's
a
real
problem
i'm
having,
not
some
hypothetical
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true,
but
what
do
you
do
about,
say,
students
have
guns
in
schools,
you
know,
and
it's
quite
possible
some
other
kid
knows
that
the
gun,
and
can
describe
everything
in
utmost
detail,
but
just
doesn't
want
to
get
involved,
so
he
phones
up,
describes
it
in
absolute
detail,
but
doesn't
give
his
name,
and
then
it
checks
out
immediately,
but
for
the
name.
so
i
mean,
it
isn't
just
an
absurd
tip.
it
isn't
great
reliability,
but
it
isn't
terrible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
they
haven't
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
an
instance
where
the
tipster
calls
up,
gives...
we
could
imagine...
i
don't
know
how
much
detail
you
have
to
have,
but
they
say
there's
a
description.
the
description
we
can
imagine
is
in
detail.
imagine
that
it
is,
you
know.
the
issue
is
the
anonymity,
not
just
calling
up
and
saying
somebody
has
a
gun.
he
has
to
describe
the
person
in
some
detail.
it
has
to
check
out.
it's
not
that
there
are
no
checks.
it's
just,
there
isn't
enough
of
a
check.
--it
is
true
that
in
white
this
court
held
that
the
same
type
of
details
absent
a
tip
would
not
have
been
sufficient.
