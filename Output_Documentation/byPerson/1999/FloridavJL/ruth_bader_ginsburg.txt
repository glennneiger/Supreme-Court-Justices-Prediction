justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel,
the
officer's
experience
is
that
guns
are
often
mixed
up
with
drugs,
so
the
anonymous
tip
is,
three
guys
standing
on
a
street
corner,
and
one
of
them
in
a
plaid-like
shirt
has
crack,
and
the
police
officer
knows
from
his
experience
that
people
who
engage
in
selling
crack
often
have
guns,
so
does
it
follow,
from
what
you
say,
the
police
having
an
anonymous
tip
about
crack
can
therefore
frisk
for
a
weapon?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he's
not...
the
officer's
concern,
in
this
case
she,
her
concern
is
not
the
drugs
but
the
gun.
she
knows
from
her
experience
that
those
two
very
often
go
together,
so
why,
on
the
same
safety
rationale
for
the
police
officer,
once
she
gets
there,
couldn't
she
say,
well,
the
tip
was
about
drugs,
but
i
know
from
experience
that
he's
probably
carrying
a
gun,
so
i'm
going
to,
for
my
safety,
frisk
him?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
neimand,
do
you
concede...
there
were
three
people
standing
at
that
street
corner,
and
the
officer
frisked
them
all.
as
to
the
other
two...
the
anonymous
tip
related
only
to
the
one
with
the
plaid-like
shirt.
as
to
the
other
two,
was
that
wrongful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
frisk
the
other
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
guilt
by
association.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
in
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
gornstein,
there
was
nothing
in
this
tip
to
convey
that.
the
officer
reported
she
was
told
that
there
were
several
black
males
standing
at
a
bus
stop,
a
description
given
of
each
one.
the
male
with
the
gun
had
a
plaid-looking
shirt
and
was
a
black
male.
that's...
i
don't
recall
other
information.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sepler,
may
i
ask
you
in
the
school
setting,
i
just...
this
just
occurred
to
me,
so
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
this
way,
that
there's
a
custodial
kind
of
relationship
between
the
school
and
the
student,
so
if
there's
a
tip
about
a
student
gun,
maybe
the
principal
has
some
authority
which
the
principal
can
give
to
the
police
that
doesn't
exist
when
you
have
an
anonymous
tip
about
somebody
standing
at
a
bus
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
an
anonymous
caller
told
the
miami-dade
county
florida
police
that
a
young
black
male
standing
at
a
particular
bus
stop
and
wearing
a
plaid
shirt
was
carrying
a
gun.
police
officers
drove
to
the
bus
stop
where
they
saw
a
person,
we
will
call
j.l.,
a
black
male
wearing
a
plaid
shirt.
j.l.
is
the
defendant
respondent
in
this
case.
apart
from
the
tip,
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
suspect
j.l.
of
any
wrongdoing.
one
of
the
officers
frisked
j.l.
and
seized
a
gun
from
his
pocket.
florida
supreme
court
held
the
search
unlawful
under
the
first
amendment
and
we
affirm
that
judgment.
in
1990
in
alabama
v.
white,
this
court
held
that
anonymous
tips
can
justify
police
risks,
but
only
if
they
present
signs
of
reliability
adequate
to
arouse
reasonable
suspicion.
in
that
case,
an
anonymous
caller
told
the
police
that
a
certain
woman
was
carrying
cocaine.
the
caller
described
not
only
the
woman,
but
what
she
was
about
to
do;
she
would
leave
a
certain
building,
drive
a
certain
car
along
an
identified
route.
only
after
the
police
observed
the
woman,
acting
as
the
caller
said
she
would,
we
explained,
did
it
become
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
caller
had
inside
information
about
the
woman,
and
on
that
account
to
credit
the
caller’s
report
of
the
woman’s
cocaine
carriage.
the
anonymous
call
about
j.
l.
in
contrast,
gave
the
police
no
information
on
what
j.l.
would
do;
it
left
the
police
without
a
clue
concerning
the
caller’s
knowledge
or
credibility.
florida
emphasizes
that
the
tip
accurately
described
the
suspect’s
appearance;
it
really
was
a
young
black
male
wearing
a
plaid
shirt
at
the
bus
stop.
but
the
tip
reliability
necessary
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
is
not
just
accuracy
in
identifying
a
particular
person,
the
tip
most
essentially
must
bear
signs
of
reliability
regarding
the
charged
conduct
here,
the
unlawful
carriage
of
a
weapon.
a
bare
tip
about
an
unlawful
gun
carriage,
florida
suggests,
should
generally
permit
a
stop
and
frisk
because
guns
are
so
very
dangerous.
but
a
firearm
exception
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
could
endanger
everyone’s
liberty;
such
an
exception
would
enable
anyone
seeking
to
make
trouble
for
another
to
instigate
an
intrusive
embarrassing
police
search
simply
by
placing
an
anonymous
call,
falsely
reporting
that
the
other
is
unlawfully
carrying
a
gun.
the
fourth
amendment
secures
all
persons
against
such
easy
invasion.
we
do
not
speculate
now
on
whether
in
some
cases
the
danger
might
be
so
great
as
to
justify
a
search
even
without
a
showing
of
the
caller’s
or
the
tip's
reliability.
we
do
not
say
for
example
that
a
report
of
a
person
carrying
a
bomb
need
bear
the
same
indicia
of
reliability
we
require
for
a
report
that
a
person
is
carrying
a
firearm.
we
hold
only
that
something
more
than
a
bareboned
anonymous
tip
must
be
shown
to
justify
a
firearm
frisk.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
