well,
i
think
we
can
follow
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
let's
assume
that
with
all
the
efforts
the
police
may
make
in
the
bomb
case,
or
with
no
efforts
because
there
is
no
time,
the
police
have
nothing
more
than
they
have
in
this
case,
except
instead
of
a
gun,
the
tip
talks
about
a
bomb.
is
it
lawful
for
the
police
to
go
into
the
school
locker
in
justice
o'connor's
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they
don't
know
that.
all
they
know
is
the
tip.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
proper
answer
to
say,
there
are
times
when
the
police
ought
to
commit
trespass
and
just
go
in
anyway,
fourth
amendment
or
no
fourth
amendment?
