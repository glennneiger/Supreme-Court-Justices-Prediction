justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
closest
case
in
this
court,
in
your
view,
that
you
think
supports
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
court
there
said
that
standing
alone
the
tip
in
the
alabama
case
would
not
warrant
someone
of
reasonable
caution
in
the
belief
that
a
stop
was
appropriate,
but
in
this
case,
there
is
more
than
the
tip,
and
it
went
on
to
articulate
other
factors.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
may
have
said
that
elsewhere,
but
it
also
said
what
i
read
to
you,
that
standing
alone,
it
wouldn't
be
enough,
so
to
accept
your
view
we
would
have
to
move
a
step
beyond
alabama.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
arguing,
then,
for
a
firearm
exception
on
the
anonymous
tip
doctrine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
even
illegal
in
florida
to
carry
a
concealed
firearm,
or
can
people--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--legally
have
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
one
does
not
assume
in
florida
that
in
every
instance
possession
of
a
firearm
concealed
is
unlawful?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
if
in
this
very
same
case
the
tip
were,
there
is
a
man
in
a
plaid
shirt
who's
in
possession
of
a
marijuana
cigarette
standing
on
the
corner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
tip
here
is,
there's
a
weapon,
and
the
officer
is
nowhere
near
it,
but
you
say
that
that's
enough
to
assume
that
the
officer's
safety
is
in
jeopardy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he's
taking
his
car
to
drive
over
to
check
it
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he's
not
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
one
would
have
thought
nothing,
unless
we
extend
the
anonymous
tip
doctrine
to
cover
it.
i
mean,
i
would
have
though
that...
our
cases
would
suggest
the
anonymous
tip,
with
nothing
more
than
somebody
in
a
plaid
shirt
on
a
street
corner
has
a
concealed
weapon,
i
wouldn't
have
though
that
was
enough,
unless
we
somehow
extend
the
doctrine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
say
that
was
met
here,
do
you,
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
facts
were
there,
other
than
the
anonymous
tip,
and
someone
who,
in
fact,
was
on
a
street
corner
in
a
plaid
shirt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
readily
apparent
that
it
was
a
juvenile?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
somebody
know
whether
the
person
were
18
or
17
on
appearance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
do
we
know
here?
did
the
tip
say
it
was
a
youngster?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
not
an
automatic
weapon,
just
a
weapon
at
school,
anonymous
tip?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
sure.
the
school
has
policy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
weapons
in
school.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
anonymous
tip,
weapon.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
matter
if
the
tipster
said,
these
are
young
people,
and
under
florida
law
someone
under
21
may
not
have
a
weapon?
does
that
alter
the
equation
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
an
additional
factor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
florida
law
prohibit
people
under
age
21
from
carrying
concealed
weapons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
a
minute,
so
i'm
clear.
it
is...
is
it
lawful
or
not
in
florida
for
someone
under
21
to
have
a
concealed
weapon?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now...
then
if
the
tipster
says
it
is
a
young
person
who
has
a
concealed
weapon,
he's
standing
on
a
street
corner
in
a
plaid
shirt,
the
officer
goes
there
and
says,
hmm,
plaid
shirt,
street
corner,
yep,
looks
young,
that's
an
additional
factor,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
it's
in
a
school,
and
the
school
is
very
nervous
about
danger
to
the
students,
and
they
get
the
tip
about
someone
in
the
school,
either
with
a
weapon
or
a
bomb?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
our
assumption
is,
it's
anonymous.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's--
we
don't
know
if
it's
reliable.
it
came
out
of
the
blue.
it's
a
phone
call.
that's
the
tip.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
know
anything
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
can
you
know?
how
can
you
possibly
make
that
assessment
as
a
police
officer
when
you're
in
a
place
like
a
school
or
a
public
building
with
many
people,
potentially
in
great
danger?
how
do
you
make
that
assessment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
may
not
be
enough.
we're
in
a
time
after
we've
seen
tragedies
like
at
the
columbine
high
school
in
colorado,
and
if
i'm
correct,
a
number
of
high
schools
around
the
country
are
now
putting
out
guidelines
and
asking
fellow
students
to
please
alert
the
school
authorities
any
time
the
student
thinks
there
might
be
someone
in
the
school
with
a
gun,
and
so
i
think
we're
going
to
see
lots
of
anonymous
tips
coming
along
in
the
setting
of
public
schools
and
in
the
aftermath
of
some
real
tragedies.
now,
what's
our
analysis
supposed
to
be?
does
it
bend
a
little,
or
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
that
same
question,
we
have
any
number
of
countless
cases
of
terry
stops
where
there
was
a
furtive
movement,
it
was
a
high
crime
neighborhood
and
so
forth.
