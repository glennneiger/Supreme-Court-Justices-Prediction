justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
say...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
hope
you
will...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
limiting
principle?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
very
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
give
me
an
example
of
some
supplementation
that
you
think
is
appropriate
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
you...
if
you
have
two
school
districts...
or
let's
say
you
have
two
parochial
schools.
one
buys
the
texts
for
the
students.
the
other
makes
the
students
buy
the
texts
for
themselves.
that
would
be
a
distinction
that
the
government
would
have
to
follow
in...
in...
in
funding
for...
in
giving
textbooks...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
one
they
could
and
the
other
they
couldn't?
that
doesn't
make
much
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
supplant...
supplant
and
supplement
means
unimportant
and
important.
the
government
can't
do
anything
that's
important.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right,
but...
