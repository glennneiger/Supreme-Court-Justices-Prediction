mr.
lee
boothby
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
stake
in
this
case
is
our
historic
commitment
to
the
principle
that
taxpayers
must
not
be
compelled
to
subsidize
the
religious
education
of
sectarian
schools.
as
i've
listened
to
the
arguments
this
morning,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
the
secretary's
brief,
and
it
encompasses
the
view
of
the
respondents,
that
the
supplement-and-not-supplant
requirement
of
chapter
2
and
the
provision
with
reference
to
non-divertibility
are
both
constitutionally
required.
this
is
in
distinction...
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
in
the
agostini
case,
that
represents
an
example
where,
as
the
court
clearly
pointed
out,
the
chapter
1
program
was
a
supplemental
program.
it
was
a
program
that
was
actually
being
conducted
by
the
public
school
under
the
public
school
supervision.
the
equipment
and
materials
were
kept
separate
and
utilized
for
that
supplemental
program.
as
i
understand
the
debate
that
took
place
within
the
court
on
that
question
was
whether
you
could
draw
the
line
between
a
supplemental
program
and
a
general
educational
program,
and
the
court
indicated
that
that
line
could
be
drawn.
i
think
it's
much
more
difficult,
however,
to
start
drawing
the
line
within
the
area
where
it's
general
education,
where
these
are
core
educational
classes,
core
educational
functions.
mr.
lee
boothby
that...
that
is...
mr.
lee
boothby
yes.
mr.
lee
boothby
no,
i...
mr.
lee
boothby
no,
i
don't
think
so.
now,
the
court
has
previously
made
the
distinction
there
on
the
basis...
on
two
bases,
actually;
one,
that...
that
it
is
not
direct
aid
to
the
school.
in
the
allen
case,
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
court
that
historically
the
parents
had
purchased
the
books.
so
it
did
not
relieve
the
school
of
an
educational
cost
they
would
otherwise
have
to
assume,
and
there
was
not
a
problem
with
divertibility
because
the
book...
books
that
were
furnished
were
books
that
could
be
looked
at,
in
fact,
were,
in
fact,
utilized
in
the
public
schools,
and
therefore,
there
was
not
a
problem
of
divertibility
and
it
was
not...
mr.
lee
boothby
taking
the
software...
and
there
are
two
issues
we
have
to
look
at...
the
one
issue
is
whether
supplanting,
at
least
in
louisi...
in
louisiana,
there
are
standards
that
are
required
that
a
certain
amount
of
software
has
to
be...
has
to
be
owned
by...
or...
or
within
the...
in
the
control
of
both
the
public
and
non-public
schools.
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
there...
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
when
i
went
to
parochial
school,
i
had
to
buy
my
textbooks,
and
so
it
was
a
cost
either
to
either
myself
and
my
parent.
mr.
lee
boothby
as
i
understand,
for
instance,
in...
in
the
zobrest
case,
the
question
was
there
as
to
whether
the...
the
government
funding
relieved
the
school
of
a
cost
they
would
otherwise
have
to
assume
and
with
reference...
as...
as
you've
just
indicated,
justice
scalia,
when
you
went
to...
to
the
parochial
school,
you
had
to
pony
up
with
the
amount
of
money
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
provide
the
textbooks.
so
the
school
was
not
relieved
of
any
cost
they
would
have
otherwise
had
to
have
assumed.
mr.
lee
boothby
it
was...
it
was
direct
aid
to...
to
the
parent,
and
i...
and
i
think
the
supplement-and-not-supplant
requirement
that's
in
chapter
2
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
we
will
not
give
direct
aid
to
the
school,
but
it
is
permissible
to
give
aid
directly
to
the
parent.
i
think
that's
where
the
distinction
is.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
there
are
two
major
distinctions
between
the
textbooks
and
with
reference
to
the
computers.
the
first
distinction
is,
as
pointed
out
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
national
school
boards
association...
is
that
computers
are...
are...
are
required
to
be
in
the
school,
and
as...
as
indicated
earlier
by...
by
the
counsel
for
the...
for
the
government,
those
are
things
that
a
school
has
to
have
to
operate.
it
is
true
that
textbooks
must
be
used
for
a
school
to
operate,
but
as
i
indicated,
as
i
understand
the
allen
decision
and
the
decisions
that
have
come
down
since
then,
it
was
determined
that
that
was
something
that
the
parents
normally
purchased.
it
did
not
relieve
the
school
of
the...
of
the
cost
they
would
otherwise
have
to
bear.
mr.
lee
boothby
it...
mr.
lee
boothby
it
is
a
distinction
that
this
court
has
previously
made,
and...
and
as
i've
indicated,
that
would
be
certainly
nothing
that
would
be
divertible.
the
textbook
is
not
divertible...
mr.
lee
boothby
but
the
computer
is
certainly
divertible.
it
can
be
used
for
almost
any
purpose.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
i
think
the
cochran
case
allowed
it,
and...
and...
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
the
point
was
made
in
cochran
that
it...
it...
it
did
not
relieve
the
school
of
a
cost
of
otherwise
educating
the
student.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
the
first
time
that
the
court
made
that
observation.
mr.
lee
boothby
to
my
knowledge,
all
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
textbooks
have
approved
that
on...
on
the...
on
the...
on
both
bases
that
i've
indicated
that
it
did
not
supplant
and
that
it
was
not
a
divertible
type
of
material.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
understand
the
termto
mean
generally
the
same
thing
as...
as...
as
your
honor
indicated
in
the
zobrest
case
that
it
did
not
relieve
the
school
of
a
cost
that
they
would
otherwise
have
to
bear
in...
in
the
education...
the
core
education
of
the...
of
the
students
that
were
in...
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
i...
i
would
say
it
should
not
be.
perhaps
the
one
basis
would
be
that
what
is
required
within
the
state...
for
instance,
the
state
of
louisiana
requires
that
a
certain
number
of
text...
certain
number
of
library
books
be
purchased
each
year
and
that
they
be
called
out,
and...
and
the
interesting
thing...
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
i
think
that
there's...
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
i
think
there
are
certain
items
that
are
so
fundamental
in
the
operation
of
a
school,
such
as
a
library,
that
you
cannot
function,
you
cannot
operate
a
school
without...
mr.
lee
boothby
having
those
items,
like
desks
and
blackboards
and...
mr.
lee
boothby
i
would
say
the
same
thing
about
computers
today.
they
are
basic
to
the
operation
of
the
school,
and
therefore,
like
bricks,
like
mortar,
like
blackboards,
like
desks,
they
must
be...
they
must
be
provided
if
you
are
going
to
operate
a
school.
and
if
the
government
provides
that,
then
the
government
is
actually
supporting
that
particular
school.
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
i
think
the
government
can
do
many
things
that
are
important,
but
as
i
understand,
our
historic
commitment
is
that
taxpayers
will
not
be
required
to...
whether
they're
members
or
non-members
of
the
faith...
be
required
by...
by
tax
law
to
contribute
to
religious
education,
and
certainly,
within
the
schools
and
jefferson
parish,
we
know
that
they
do
not
separate
out
religion
from
the
secular
classes,
and
the...
the
decision
for
this
court
has
historically
always
been
that
we
may
not
engage
in
the
type
of
funding
that...
that
provides
the
aid
that
may
aid
both
religion
and
the
secular.
but
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
dealing
with
an
applied
determination
that
the
law
was
not
constitutional.
it
was
not
constitutionally
applied,
and
we
know
that...
we
know
in
jefferson
parish,
it
wasn't
just
some
books
that
were
furnished.
the
testimony
from
the
assistant
superintendent
of
schools
for
the
archdiocese
that
had
jurisdiction
over
these
schools
testified...
and
this
is
on
page
63a
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
testified
the
monies
that
were
allocated
for
chapter
2
of
state
library
books
were
first
used,
and
then
if
that
library
wanted
additional
volumes,
then
if
monies
were
available,
they...
they
would
use
those
funds.
in
many
cases,
there
were
no
funds
available.
they
had
to
rely
on
the
chapter
2
of
the
state
library
in
order
to
furnish
their
libraries.
well,
that
sounds
to
me
like
supplanting.
that
does
not
sound
to
me
like
a
situation
where
someone
is
merely
supplementing
a
few
additional
books.
mr.
lee
boothby
no.
i...
i
would
not
go
that
far.
i
think
that
it
is...
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
it
is
con...
i
think
it
is
conceivable
that
one
might
in
the
approp...
if
the
statute
was
properly
drawn
and
properly
administered...
make
some
determination
that
it
is
merely
supplementing
a
particular...
maybe
in
a
particular
field
or...
or
utilizing...
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
it
might
be
permissible,
for
instance,
to
provide
some
arrangements
for
musical
instruments
to
be
utilized
within
the
school.
that
might
be
supplemental.
i
don't
know.
mr.
lee
boothby
i...
i
wouldn't
have
a
problem
with
them
paying...
playingor
any
other
song.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
have
no
problem
with
school
buses.
if...
if...
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
i
have
no
problem
with
transporting
children
to
and
from
school.
i
do
have
problems...
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
i
would
have
prob...
well,
i
think...
mr.
lee
boothby
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
wolman,
once
you
would
give
the
bus
to
the
school,
then
they
could
use
it
for
whatever
purposes.
they
certainly
could
be
utilized
for
a
whole
variety
of
purposes
in
addition
to
that
which
was...
which
was
approved
in...
in
the
everson
case.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
it's
much
easier
to
follow
the
principles
that
at
least
we
have
some
historical
precedent
for
than
to
adopt
some
new
neutrality
concept
where
we
don't
know
whether
you
can
build
schools
or
you
can
buy
desks
or...
mr.
lee
boothby
or
where
the
line
can
be
drawn.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
of
course,
the
distinction
in
that
case
was,
again,
whether
you
were
relieving
the
school
of
a
cost
they
would
otherwise
have
to
assume.
mr.
lee
boothby
in
the
case
of
the
text...
mr.
lee
boothby
yes,
i
would
agree
that
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
concerns
in
reaching
a
solution
to
this
very
important
question
is
whether
there
is
an
appreciable
risk
or
a
substantial
risk
that
what
the
government
is
doing
will
ultimately
result
inculcation.
i
also
think,
however,
you
cannot
completely
eliminate
the
concern
that
the
government
may
through
its
funding...
may
not
be
directly
inculcating,
but
may
take
over
such...
such
an
amount
or
a
certain
amount
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
cost
of
the
education
of
the
program
where
all
you...
where
all
you
have
is...
is
the...
left
is
the
prohibition
against
the
teaching
in
the
religion
class,
and
we
know
that
that
would
not
prevent
the
inculcation
of
religion
in
sectarian
schools
because
sectarian
schools
do
not
compartmentalize
the
teaching
of
religion
and
they
should
not.
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
with
this
particular
program,
with
this
particular
statute,
and
with
the
guidance
that
i
understand
that
the
secretary
has
propounded.
as
i
understand
the
guidance
that
is
being
propounded
and
what
each
of
the
schools...
school
principals
must
sign
an
assurance
not
to
do
is
to
use
the
items
for
any
kind
of
sectarian
purpose.
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is...
mr.
lee
boothby
that
is
correct,
but
the
problem
is...
is
that
what
you're
really
doing
by
those
kind
of
rules
is
to
say
to
the
school,
well,
while
you're
teaching
religion
and
you're
using
the
sectar...
the
government-provided
tools,
you
have
to
suppress
your
religious
views.
mr.
lee
boothby
but...
but
there
is
a
powerful...
there
is
a
powerful
argument
out
there
to...
to
take
the
aid
and
compromise
your
religious
views,
and
that
was...
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
marie
schneider
at
catholic
and
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit
found
the
aid
to
be
something
that
was
very
distasteful
and
she
felt
to
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
tend
to
secularize
the
school...
mr.
lee
boothby
that
she
supported.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
i
think
she
did
that,
but
found
that
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
court
to
ultimately
resolve
the
problem.
mr.
lee
boothby
that...
that
is
inherent
every
time
that
government
furnishes
aid
that
goes
to
something
like
computers,
something
like...
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
not
in
the...
mr.
lee
boothby
not
in
the
sectarian
school
i
attended
where
creation
was
taught
as
the...
as
the...
as
the
origin
of
life.
i
think
it
would...
mr.
lee
boothby
might
be
very
difficult.
mr.
lee
boothby
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that,
for
instance,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
a
geography
book
might
be
used
for
sectarian
purposes
because
somebody
might
pick
it
up
and
say,
oh,
there
is
salt
lake
city
or
there
is
the
vatican
or
there
is
some
other
place
that
has
some
kind
of
religious
purpose.
mr.
lee
boothby
but
i...
mr.
lee
boothby
well...
mr.
lee
boothby
i
think
the
science
lab
may
be
different,
but
i
am
certain
about
computers
where...
which
is
probably
the
most
highly
divertible
type
of
item
that
can
ever
be
utilized
within
a
school.
you
can
use
it
for
almost
any
purpose.
mr.
lee
boothby
with
reference
to
the
computer
in...
in
san
francisco,
that
was
a
locked
computer,
and
that
could
not,
as
i
understand
the
technology,
be
diverted
to
a
religious
purpose.
the...
the
remaining
problem
would
be
if
the
court
would
find
that
that
was
the
type
of
equipment
that
all
schools
would
ordinarily
have
to
purchase
in
order
to
function
and
whether
if
the
court
continues
to
agree
with
the
fact
that
one
should
not
fund
in
whole
or
in
part
what
might
be
termed
the
secular
aspect
of
the
school,
but...
but
with
reference
to...
to
the
computer
in
san
francisco,
i
think
it
did
take
care
of
the
divertibility
problem.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
it
might
solve
the
divertibility
problem.
it
would
not
solve
the
supplanting
problem,
which
i
still
believe...
mr.
lee
boothby
that...
that's
correct.
the
problem
of
it...
mr.
lee
boothby
the
problem
of
it
is...
and
again,
this
is
an
administration-of-the-program
case.
as
i
understand
it,
ms.
underwood
agreed
that
it
might
be
a
problem
if
you
added
a
computer
because
there
were
more
students.
on
page
186
of
the
joint
appendix
of
the
immaculata
high
school
in
its
needs
assessment
in
describing
why
it
needed
various
types
of
equipment
said:
while
effective
use
has
been
made
of
the
audiovisual
materials
which
have
been
purchased
with
chapter
ii
funds,
they
must
be
replaced
and
updated
from
time
to
time
our
enrollment
has
increased
somewhat,
so
that
more
students
use
the
library
materials
and
consequently,
more
audiovisual
software
is
needed.
that
sounds
to
me
like
supplementing,
and
the
problem
of
it
is...
mr.
lee
boothby
the
problem
is...
is
that
you
have
to...
you
have
to
find
out
whether
the
statute
is
being
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
way
it
is
written.
the
problem
is
this.
as
i
understand
the
guidance
that
is
now
given
to
us
by
the
secretary
in
1999
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
he
now
looks
to
usage
logs.
he
says
okay,
you
can
have
usage
logs
and
you'll
know
whether
the
computer
was...
was
used
properly
or
not.
the
problem
in
jefferson
parish,
the
only
two
cases
where
we
had
usage
logs,
they
mixed
the
chapter
ii
and
their
own
equipment
together.
so,
when
you
looked
at
the
usage
log...
and
we
do
have
an
example
of
the
usage
log
in...
on
page
206a
and
207a
and
we
find
that
the
theology
department
had
the
next-to-the-highest
usage
out
of
3
of
the
4
years,
but
the
answer
was,
well,
you
don't
know
whether
it
was
purchased
by
chapter
ii
funds
or
whether
it
was
purchased
by
school
funds,
that
was
the
answer
that
was
given
to
us
and...
mr.
lee
boothby
pardon?
mr.
lee
boothby
how
would
one
know?
we
don't
know,
but
the
problem
of
it
is,
is
that
the
school
district
couldn't
know
either.
that's
the
problem.
they
could...
they
could
look
at
the
usage
logs
and
they
wouldn't
be
any
more
informed.
mr.
lee
boothby
well,
in
jefferson
parish...
mr.
lee
boothby
that
isn't
the
problem,
as
i
understand
it.
for
instance,
there...
the...
mr.
lewis
who
was
head
of
the
program
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
he
explained
one
of
the
problems
was
that
there
was
such
a
major
turnover
of
the
people
that
were
in
charge
of
the
chapter
ii
program
of
the
sectarian
schools
that
many
times
those
that
were
in
charge
of
the
program
weren't
really
fully
instructed
and
didn't
know.
the
insurance
is
they're
only...
only
signed
once
every
3
years,
and
the
people
that
were
involved
with
the
program
weren't
informed.
the
second
problem
was
indicated
with
these
191
books
that
were
furnished
and...
and
returned
to
us
9
days
after
our
lawsuit
was
filed,
and
when
we
went
to
one
of
the
teachers,
ms.
cannon
from
st.
anthony
school,
her
explanation
was...
she
said
i
would
never
have
ordered
those
books,
and
i
believe
her.
she
said,
though,
we
gave
the
task
to
a
volunteer
parent,
and
she
selected
the
books
and
i
looked
to
see
whether
the
total
was
within
our
allotment.
mr.
lee
boothby
our
problem
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
have
certain
equipment
like
computers
provided
that
will
not
be
diverted
unless
you
do
have
locked
computers,
but
if
you
have
just
the
normal
computer
that
you
can
do
anything
with,
hooking
into
the
internet,
i
don't
know
how
you're
ever
going
to
police
the,
regardless
of
the...
mr.
lee
boothby
your
honor...
mr.
lee
boothby
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
internet,
i
would
agree.
this
is
not
the
case
to
decide
that
issue.
this
case
came
before
vice
president
gore
invented
the
internet,
and
i
really
don't
know
what
the
problems
might
be
with
reference
to
the
internet
and
computers.
i
really
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
and
i
think
that
case
must
come
later
and
then
we'll
find
out
what
requirements
are
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
that
problem
from
occurring.
in
conclusion,
respondents
assert
that
when
the
government
elects...
when
the
government
elects
to
provide
aid
directly
to
and
under
the
meaningful
control
of
church-operated
elementary
and
secondary
schools
for
their
core
or
essential
educational
functions,
it
results
in
an
unconstitutional
subsidy
to
pervasively
sectarian
institutions,
and
when
the
aid
provided,
which
consists
of
government
resources,
still
legally
owned
by
the
government
is
also
divertible
to
religious
use
by
those
in
possession,
the
aid
program
also
bears
the
substantial
risk
of
being
used
as
an
instrument
to
inculcate
sectarian
doctrine.
now,
as
i
understand...
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
the
petitioners,
what
they
want
this
court
to
do
is
to
adopt
a
concept
which
basically
says
it's...
