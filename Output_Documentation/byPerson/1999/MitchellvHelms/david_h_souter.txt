justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
what...
what
your
answer
is
to
justice
stevens.
you...
you
have
said,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
don't
think
that
the
supplement/
supplant
distinction
is
a
constitutionally
required
distinction;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
it
is
not
a
constitutionally
required
distinction
and,
therefore,
at
least
in
some
categories
of
aid,
there
could
be
a
complete
supplantation...
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
that
is
also
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
if
the
distinction...
if
the
distinction
is
not
required,
then
i
presume
there
are
certain
categories
of
aid
in
which
the
government
in
effect
or
categories
of
supply
to...
to
sectarian
schools
that
the
government
could
take
over
completely
without
violating
any
constitutional
norm.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i
don't
understand
what
you
say
when
you
say
the...
the
distinction
is
not
constitutionally
required.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
what...
justice
david
h.
souter
the
chief
justice
often...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
the
chief
justice's
question,
every
one
of
those
criteria
is
satisfied.
the...
there...
there
is...
there
is
certainly
no
doctrinal
element
in
the
bricks,
and
his
hypothesis
is
that
the
school
gets
turned
over
and
the
government's
contact
with
it
ceases
at
the
moment
the
teaching
begins.
so
i
presume
that
would
be...
that
would
be
entirely
constitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
justice
stevens'
question,
and
it's
mine.
what
is
your
limiting
principle?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we'd
like
to
know
what
the
principle
is
that
we
ought
to
bear
in
mind
in...
in
deciding
all
of
these
cases,
and
i
want
to
know
what
yours
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
does
not...
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
answers
our
question
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
answer
to
the
question
a
moment
ago,
in
referring
to
the
three
agostini
principles,
you
in
effect
came
up
with
a
scheme
which
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothesis
that
building
the
school
for
the...
for
the
parochial
school
would
be
entirely
constitutional.
you
back
off
from
that
conclusion,
and
i
understand
why
you
would,
but
i
don't
know
what
your
limiting
principle
is
for
backing
off
from
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
no
entanglement
problem
in
building
that
school.
that
is
the
hypothesis
of
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
hypothesis,
the
government
says
here's
the
school,
it's
yours.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
hasn't,
but
the
chief
justice
just
did,
and...
and
that's...
that's
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
hypothesis
of
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
you...
as
you
point
out,
though,
in
the
real
world,
there...
there
are
conditions
and
there
will
be
at
least
threats
of
entanglement,
and...
and
as
i
understand
it
so
far,
you've
said,
you
know,
there
are
limits.
in
other
words,
there's...
there's
a...
there's
a...
somehow
there's
a
point
beyond
which
the
government
cannot
go.
is
that
point
defined
in
your
judgment
entirely
by
the
entanglement
concept?
in
other
words,
there's
a
point
in
which
there's
too
much
entanglement
or
a
threat
of
too
much
entanglement?
is
that
what
defines
the
point
at
which
something
becomes...
aid
becomes
too
much?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but...
but
in...
in
the...
in
the
practical
terms
of
this
case,
i
take
it,
it's
an...
this
is
really
an
entanglement
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
we
have
to
police
the
supplement/
supplant
distinction,
and
i
thought
that
raised
the
entanglement
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
underwood,
i
take
it,
in
response
to
an
earlier
question,
you
spoke
of
secular
materials,
and
just
recently,
you
spoke
of
the
need
to
monitor
even
materials
that
were...
were
provided,
which
did
not
supplant.
do
you
think
there
is
a
legitimate
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
secular
materials
that
have
a...
a
preestablished
content,
like
a
math
textbook,
and
materials
like
a
computer
which
in
effect
are
neutral,
they
can
transmit
anything
and
be
used
for
anything,
for
purposes
of
the
monitoring?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at...
at
some...
basically,
on
the
textbook
theory,
if
we
follow
our
prior
cases,
once
the
textbook
has
been
screened
as
having
no
independently
religious
content,
the
government's
interest
in
the
textbook
constitutionally
is
over.
i
mean,
i...
and
i
take
it
that's
your
starting
point
here,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
not
the
case
for
the
computer.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
reason
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
why
the
monitoring
is
required.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the
lectern
in
effect
like
the
general
bricks
and
mortar
prohibition?
you
can't
build
a
school,
we
assume,
and
i...
i
suppose
you
then
would
have
the
same
issue
if
you
start
furnishing
the
school.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
government
feel
that
the
jurisprudence
here
would
be
helped
if
we
started
developing,
more
or
less,
hard-and-fast
categories,
like
no
bricks
and
mortar
and,
hence,
no
lecterns
and
no
desks,
but
textbooks
are
okay
and
maybe
other
books
are
okay?
would
that
be
an
approach
to
what
is
an
almost
impossible
line-drawing
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was...
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
computers?
justice
david
h.
souter
has
never
been
a
sufficient
criterion
because,
if
that
were
the
only
criterion,
everson
would
have
gone
the
other
way,
i
presume,
or
at
least
it
certainly
would
in
this
day
and
age
in
which
schools
by
and
large
have
to
do
a
lot
of
transportation,
and
if...
if
that's
our
criterion,
i
don't
know
what
it
limits.
don't
you
think
that
what
we
have
been
doing
is...
is
groping
in
the
direction
of
trying
to
identify
forms
of
aid
by
reference
to
the
risk
that
they
can
be
used
directly
for
religious
teaching?
is...
is
that
not
the
reason
why
we
say
okay,
some
textbooks
can
be
supplied,
a
math
book
could
be
perhaps?
it
might
go
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
core
function
in...
of
all
teaching,
but
it
doesn't
have
a
risk
that
it's
going
to
be
used
to...
to
inculcate
religious
beliefs.
anything
is
possible,
but
it's
not
very
high.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
start
paying
teacher
salaries
in
religious
schools
in
which
the
very
mission
of
the
school
includes
a
religious
inculcation,
you
cannot
possibly
separate
what
pays
for
the
religion
and
what...
what
does
not,
and
don't
you
think
that
we
are
groping
in...
in
the
direction
of
some
kind
of
a
risk
of
direct
religious
use
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
those
items
carry
a
risk
of
that
kind
of
use.
justice
david
h.
souter
library
book
as
a
category
can
include
religious
books.
computers
can
be
used,
i
guess,
for
religious
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even...
i
take
it
on
your
argument,
even...
you
know,
even
if...
if
we
reject
the
sort
of
roger
williams
argument
that
you've...
i
think
it
was
roger
williams
who
first
made
the
argument
in
this
country
at
least...
we
would
still
have
a
problem
simply
because
we...
we
assume
that
there
would
still
be
a
risk
of
mixing,
and
so
we'd
have
entanglement.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
it
is.
