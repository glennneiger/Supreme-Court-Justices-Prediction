justice

day
o'connor
the
fifth
circuit
relied
primarily
on
meek
and
wolman,
i
gather,
in
its
decision.
in
order
to
find
in
your
favor,
do
you
think
we
need
to
overrule
those
cases
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
didn't
mean
it.
justice

requirement.
justice

ms.
underwood...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
bring
to
mind
perhaps
this
court's
holding
in
ball
on
the
community
education
act?
do
you
suppose
that's
still
good
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
has
allowed
the
furnishing
of
textbooks
to
students,
even
though
those
students...
to
all
students,
public
and
private
and
parochial,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
accept
that...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
is
that...
does
that
violate
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
decision
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yeah.
how
about
software
for
particular
subjects
where
you
can
examine
the
content
of
it
and
don't
give
it
to
the
school,
just
maintain
the
ownership
in
the
public
agency,
but
allow
it
to
be
used,
or
a
map?
what's
the
matter
with
that
if
we
allow
textbooks?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's...
