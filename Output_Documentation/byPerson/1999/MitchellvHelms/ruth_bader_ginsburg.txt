that
was
contrary
to
fact
because
the
public
schools
were
getting
those
same
benefits.
so
i
can
see
you
saying,
yes,
you
have
to
overrule
those
cases,
but
the
kind
of
distinction
that
would
be
made,
it
seems
to
me
so
artificial,
whether
it's
in
one
statute
that
covers
public
and
private
or
separate
statutes
added
together
is
the
same
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcconnell,
the
reason
limitations
questions
were
asked
is
your
brief
goes
pretty
far.
it
even
suggests
that
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
not
to
give
the
kind
of
assistance
that's
involved
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
read
your
brief
to
say
if
they
gave
it
to
the
public
schools
and
not
these
schools.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
boothby,
all
that
sounds
like
faulty
implementation
that,
if
only
the
schools
did
what
they
pledged
to
do,
it
would
be
okay,
and
i
thought
that
wasn't
your
position.
