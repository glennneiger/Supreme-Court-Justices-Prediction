but,
mr.
mcconnell...
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
you...
you
probably
would
welcome
the
notion
that
if
you
have
a
statute
that
is
narrowly
directed
to...
to
religious
schools,
but
which
gives
them
nothing
more
than
what
is
already
given
to
public
schools
under
another
statute,
that
is
not
a...
that
is
not
a
statute
that
is
narrowly
targeted
to
religious
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
encourages
counsel...
justice
antonin
scalia
supplementing...
everybody
is
talking
about
supplement
and
supplant
as
though
that's
an
easy
call.
what...
what
causes
it?
suppose
you...
a...
if
you
have
a
poor
religious
school
that
doesn't
have...
that
doesn't
have
window
shades,
providing
window
shades
would
be
supplementing,
but
if...
if
it
was
a
rich
religious
school
that
already
had
window
shades,
window
shades
would
be
supplanting?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
going
to
happen.
why
don't
you
say
it's
no
good?
i
mean,
why
don't
you
just
say
it's
no
good
because
you
just
can't
supplement
the
whole
thing?
you're
not
giving
away
anything
that's
ever
going
to...
going
to
occur
in
the
real
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why...
why
would
that
be
bad?
suppose...
suppose
you
have
a...
a
state
that
makes
a
determination
that
a
certain
amount
of
money
per
capita,
per
student,
is
necessary
to
provide
an
adequate
secular
education.
it
enacts
a
statute
requiring
all
accredited
schools
within
the
state
to
provide
that
minimum
secular
education,
and
then
it
gives
to
all
schools
in
the
state,
both
public
schools...
and
public
schools
the
minimum
amount
of
money
necessary
to
achieve
that
secular
education.
and
it
examines
students
to
be
sure
that
they
have
gotten
that
minimum
secular
education.
now,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
might
well
be
supplanting
instead
of
supplementing,
but
all
you're...
all
you're
providing
is
the
secular
education,
which
the...
which
the
state
has
decided
requires
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
expenditure.
why
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
in
my
hypothetical,
the...
the
state
has
tried
to
be
careful
about
that.
it...
it...
you
know,
it
tests
whether
you've
given
a
secular
education,
and
it's
made
the
determination
for
our
public
schools,
which
don't
give
anything
but
secular
education,
this
amount
of
money
is
necessary.
so
we're
going
to
subsidize
the...
the
secular
education,
whatever
school
you
go
to.
now,
you
want
to
add
something
else
to
that
secular
education,
that's
your
business.
do
it
on
your
money,
but...
but
we're
just
subsidizing
secular
education
for
everybody
wherever
they
want
to
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
sort
of
a
mystic
appearances
problem?
is
that...
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
paying
for
the
secular
education,
which
is...
which
is
provided
in
the
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
has
made
a
determination
that
it
costs
that
much
to
provide
it.
what...
what
possible
constitutional
problem
is
there
if
it...
if
a
school
chooses
to
add
to
that
something
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
textbooks?
i
mean,
if
you
acknowledge
the
textbook
case
is
okay,
you
really
think
that
textbooks
was...
was
supplanting
or
supplementing?
what
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
schools
didn't
have
textbooks
before?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
to
have
been
supplanting,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
everybody
who
goes
to
parochial
school
has
to
pony
up
the
money
to...
for
the
school
and...
and
tuition.
so,
i
mean,
that
would
apply
to
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
determined
school
by
school?
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
how
you
apply
this.
i
mean,
if
one
school
bought
the
books
and...
and
charged
a
tuition
that
was...
you
know,
you
couldn't
segregate
what
part
of
the
tuition
went
to
books
or
anything
else
and
another
school
charged
a
lower
tuition,
but
the
parents
bought
the
books,
would
it
be
supplanting
in
one
school
and
supplementing
in
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
that
if
a
state
doesn't
require
computers
and
you
have
a
very
parochial
school
in
an
affluent
suburb
that
does
have
a
lot
of
computers,
you
say
you
could
provide
computers
even
though
the
school
already
has
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
must
be
doing
it
school
by
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
school
buses?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
schools
really
couldn't
operate
unless
they...
unless
they
had
school
buses.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
buses
are
given
to
the
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just
as
the
children
read
the
books,
but
the
books
are
given
to
the
school,
the
children
ride
the
buses,
but
the
buses
are
given
to
the
school.
i
don't
see
any
distinction
between
that
and
books.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
deciding
what
is...
what
is
supplementing
and
what
is
supplanting
on
an
item-by-item
basis
is
so
difficult
and
so
hard
to
do
on
a
generalized
basis.
might
it
not
be
better
to
adopt
some
rule
that,
you
know,
you
can
provide
some
aid,
but
not
so
much
that...
that
you're
effectively
enabling
schools
to...
to
function
which
otherwise
would
not
be
able
to
do
so?
wouldn't
that
be
an
easier...
easier
principle
to...
to
follow?
justice
antonin
scalia
precedent
isn't
a
very
happy
historical
precedent
when
it
says
you
can
supply
maps,
but
you
can't
supply
globes,
and,
you
know,
as
senator
moynihan
asked,
what
if
you
have
a...
what...
or
you
can
provide
books,
but
you
can't
provide...
you
can't
provide
globes,
and
senator
moynihan
says
what
if
you
have
a
book
that
has
a...
that
has
a
map
in
it.
you
know,
the
precedent
doesn't
stick
together
very
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
science
labs
would
be
okay
under
justice
souter's
theory
of
identifying
things
that,
you
know,
can
likely
be
subverted
to
religious
use
or
not,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
buy
little
science
labs
for
every
parochial
school
in
the
country,
and
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
talk...
i
mean,
yes,
i
suppose
it
is
possible
to
do
that,
but
it's
pretty
remote.
there...
there's
nothing
that
you
can't
use
to
teach
a
religious
lesson,
i
assume,
absolutely
nothing.
if
that's
going
to
be
your
test,
then
justice
souter's
approach
doesn't...
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
science
lab,
you
think
is
a
lot
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
a
lot
different
because
it
costs
a
lot
more
money,
myself,
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe...
maybe
they
didn't
keep
records,
but
i...
as
i
understand
it,
these
things
have
to
be
labeled
to
make
it
clear
that
they
were
the
product
of
these
federal
funds
and
couldn't
be
used
for
these
secular
purposes,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
these...
these
schools
you're
complaining
of,
all...
all
believe
in
the
seventh
commandment,
i
assume.
i
think
it's
the
seventh,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
willing
to
assume
that
without
some
evidence
that
there
is
an
overwhelming
problem
of
these...
of
these
religious
schools
flouting
the
law.
i'm
not
prepared
to
assume
that
that's
a
widespread
problem
that...
that
invalidates
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
say
you
haven't
found
any
problems.
i'm
not
willing
to
posit
that
there...
there
is
just
this
widespread
problem
of...
of
infraction.
