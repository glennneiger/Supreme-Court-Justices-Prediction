ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
is
not
only
neutral
with
respect
to
religion,
but
also
it
does
not
directly
support
religious
instruction
indoctrination.
it
provides
secular
materials
for
secular
uses
in
a
way
that
supplements
and
does
not
supplant
the
existing
budget
of
the
school,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
last
requirement
applies
not
only
to
religious
schools,
but
to
secular,
private,
and
public
schools
as
well.
it's
an
essential
feature
of
this
particular
aid
program.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
i'm
describing
the
statute
and
explaining
that
these
features
guarantee
its
constitutionality.
this...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
supplement-and-not-supplant
distinction
or
something
like
it
is...
i
wouldn't
say...
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
itself
would
always
be
constitutionally
mandated,
but
it
performs
the
function
here
of
guaranteeing
two
things,
guaranteeing...
helping
to
ensure
two
things:
that
the
government
aid
doesn't
go
to
the
religious
mission
of
the
school
and
that
the
aid
doesn't
become
so
substantial
as
to
in
effect
subsidize
the
whole
operation
of
the
school
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
constitutional
problem
that
it
would
raise
is
the
one
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
as
the
separate
concern
that
when
so
much
aid...
when
the
core
functions
of...
of
a
religious
school
are
subsidized
by
the
government,
at
some
point
it
becomes
impossible
to
say
that
it
is
only
the
secular
function
that
is
being
supported,
that
the
aid
is...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
in
ball...
as
long
ago
as
ball
and
as
recently
as
agostini,
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
between,
this
court
has
articulated
a
separate
principle
not
only
that
the...
that
the
money
not
be
itself
directly
used
for...
or
the
money...
or
the
aid
in
this
case
because
it's
not
money,
it's...
it's
material
that
is...
that
is
loaned...
that
it
not
be
directly
used
for
religious
instruction,
but
also
that
when
it
is...
when
the
aid
is
sufficiently
substantial
as
to
in
effect
support
the
whole
operation
of
the
school,
when
without
it
the
school
couldn't
operate,
then
the
fact
that
the
dollars
can
be
by...
by
accounting
assigned
only
to
secular
functions
isn't
sufficient
to
remove
the
appearance
and
the
understanding
and
the
fact
that
the
government
is
in
effect
subsidizing
this
school
in
totality
with
all
its...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
don't
think
it's
mystic.
i
think
appearances
are
part
of
the
problem.
i
think
when
the
government
supports
a
religious
school,
without
any
mysticism
involved...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
government
is
paying...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
problem
is
that
at
some
point
while
your...
while
your
hypothesis
has
the
number
of
dollars
being...
the
dollars
that
the
secular
part
of
the
education...
that
would
require
overturning
a
long
line
of
this
court's
cases
holding
that
the
government
can't
directly...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's...
that's
correct,
but
what
supplement
but
not
supplant
does,
it
is
one
mechanism
along
with
the...
the
array
of
safeguards
in
the
statute
to
ensure
or
to
attempt
to
ensure
that
the
materials
are
used
for
secular
purposes,
and
there
were...
there...
there
are
everything
from
asking
for
assurances
from
the
schools
to
asking...
to
marking
the
materials...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
think
that's
a...
a...
possibly
a
boundary
question.
i
would
be
inclined
to
characterize
that
as
supplanting
because,
if
the
school's
position
was
that
it
was
provided...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
then
it
would
be
simply
providing
the
same
thing
to
the
additional
students.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
they
present
slightly
different
issues
of
monitoring,
although,
of
course,
even
a
textbook
with
preestablished
content
can
be
used
by
a
teacher
in
a
wide
variety
of
ways,
including
religious
ways.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
reason...
the
reason
is
that,
on
the
one
hand,
one
could
say
that
a
computer
is
even
more
neutral
than
a
textbook,
it
has
no
content
of
its
own,
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
capable.
it
is
readily
usable
as
distinguished
from...
unlikely
to
be
used
for
wholly
sectarian
teaching
and
the
prohibition
on
that;
that
is,
the
prohibition
on
having
it
be
in
support
of
sectarian
teaching
is...
is
necessary...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
if
lecterns
were
provided
with
title
6
funds,
there...
i
mean,
there
might
well
be
a
restriction
that
they
not
be
used
in
the
theology
classroom
or,
for
that
matter,
the
pulpit
of
the
chapel
when...
when
worship
services
were
engaged
in.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
although
a
lectern,
not
being
the
whole
school,
but
something
that's
used
in
an
individual
class,
one
could
imagine
putting
a
lectern
in
the
chemistry
lab
and
having
it
be
part
of
the...
the
furnishing
of
a
chemistry
lab
that
was
more
elaborate
than
the
school
had
previously
been
able
to
or
inclined
to
undertake
and...
and
be
subject
to
the
restrictions
that
are
imposed
on
those
facilities,
those...
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it
might
be
helpful.
on
the
other
hand,
sometimes
i
think
it
works
better
to
deal
with
the
laws
that
congress
and
the
states
actually
passed
and
see
what...
i
mean,
there
is
a
general
notion
here.
there
is
a
general
principle
that
supporting
the
whole
school
when
it
is
a
religious
school
is
inappropriate
and
it
violates
the
establishment
clause
and
supporting
the
distinctively
religious
functions
violates
the
establishment
clause,
and
item
by
item,
we
can
assess
the
aid
programs
that
the
states
and
congress
provide.
