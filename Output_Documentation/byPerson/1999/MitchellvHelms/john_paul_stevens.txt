justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
question
on
that.
do
you...
do
you
adhere
to...
subscribe
to
the
fact
that
there's
a
distinction
between
supplanting
and
supplementing
the
educational
mission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
in
your
view,
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
for
the...
in
a
neutral
statute
to
say
we
will
provide
all
the
computers
and
all
the
desks
for
both
public
and
private
schools.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
place
where
your
position
would
take
us,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm...
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
that's...
that's
where
your
position
would
take
us
because...
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
answer
yes
or
no
when
they
can
and
then
explain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw,
but
i'm...
but
i'm
really
seeking
what
is
your
limiting
principle.
is
it
simply
neutrality,
or
is
there
something
else
beside
neutrality
that
limits
the
amount
of
aid
that
the
government
can
give
to
schools
on
an
equal
basis,
building
schools
for
both
parochial
and
public.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
then
what
would
the
difference
be
between
that
case
and
saying
we'll
just
supply
the
desks
and
computers?
that
would
be
the
same
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
use
them
any
way
you
want.
we
don't
want
to
interfere
with
the...
with
the
teaching
program
that
you
want
to
administer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
the
same
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
just
told
us
those
were
not
necessary.
you
said
that
the
statute
did
a
lot
of
things
that
the
constitution
did
not
require,
and
i'm
still
trying
to
find
out
what
your
limit
is,
other
than
pure
neutrality,
and
if...
if
that's
the
limit,
i
think
the
government
may
subsidize
and
may
avoid
entanglement
problems
by
simply
saying
use
the
stuff
the
way
you
want
to
and...
which
would
have
a
lot
of
merit
to
it
because
one
of
the
dangers
here
is
you
interfere
with
the
teaching
mission
of
the
parochial
school.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
make
the
hypothesis
of...
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
regulation
whatsoever,
whatever
we
buy
or
lend
to
use
just
as
you
want
to,
so
there
would
be
no
entanglement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
it's
impossible
to
imagine...
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they
would
say
we'll
supply
your
computers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
impossible
to
assume
they
might
say
we
will
supply
all
the
computers
and
you
just
use
them
the
way
you
want
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
understood
you
to...
your
brief
to
take
the
position
that
this
supplement/
supplanting
distinction
is
constitutionally
mandated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
distinction?
because
that
is
a
difficult
line
to
draw.
supposing
a
school
had
20
students
and
20
computers
and
they
got
10
more
students.
the
enrollment
went
up,
and
the
government
provided
the
extra
10...
this
is
a
parochial
school...
the
government
provided
10
more
computers.
would
that
be
supplementing
or
supplanting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
everybody
should
have
a
computer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
fair...
it's
fair...
