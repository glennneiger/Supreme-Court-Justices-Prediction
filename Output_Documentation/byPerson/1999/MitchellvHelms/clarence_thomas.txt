justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
a
federal
program
known
as
chapter
2
lends
educational
materials
and
equipment
such
as
computers,
computerware,
software,
overhead
projectors
and
library
books
to
public
and
private
schools.
in
jefferson
parish,
louisiana,
many
of
the
private
schools
that
received
chapter
2
aid
are
religiously
affiliated.
several
louisiana
tax
payers
sued
in
1985
contending
that
the
chapter
2
program
as
implemented
in
jefferson
parish
is
contrary
to
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
which
provides
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
and
establishment
of
religion.
the
case
went
many
years
before
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
with
one
district
judge
in
1990
striking
down
the
program
and
another
in
1997
reversing
the
earlier
decision
and
upholding
the
program.
in
1998,
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
with
the
first
district
court
and
struck
down
chapter
2.
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
two
decisions
of
this
court
from
the
1970s:
meek
versus
pittenger
and
wolman
versus
walter
in
which
the
court
held
unconstitutional
programs
that
provided
many
of
the
same
sorts
of
materials
and
equipment
as
does
chapter
2.
the
fifth
circuit
acknowledged
that
our
recent
establishment
clause
cases
appeared
to
have
undermined
meek
and
wolman.
in
particular,
in
1993
in
a
case
called
zobrest
we
upheld
the
program
by
which
the
government
paid
for
a
sign-language
interpreted
to
assist
the
deaf
student
at
a
catholic
high
school.
in
the
1997,
in
agostini
versus
felton
we
up
held
the
government
program
that
provided
supplemental
teaching
by
public
school
teachers
on
the
premises
of
private
religious
schools,
but
the
fifth
circuit
nevertheless
held
or
felt
bound
to
follow
meek
and
wolman
because
our
recent
decisions
had
not
expressly
overruled
them.
in
two
opinions
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
chapter
2
is
constitutional.
to
the
extent
that
meek
and
wolman
are
inconsistent
with
this
holding
we
overrule
them.
in
an
opinion
that
i
have
authored,
and
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined,
we
explain
that
under
the
criteria
set
out
in
agostini
for
determining
whether
a
school
aid
program
has
the
effect
of
advancing
religion,
chapter
2
does
not
have
such
an
effect.
most
importantly
chapter
2
is
neutral
with
regard
to
religion.
aid
is
allocated
on
the
basis
of
secular
criteria
that
neither
favor
nor
disfavor
religion.
the
aid
is
available
to
wide
array
of
schools
without
regard
to
their
religious
affiliations
or
lack
thereof,
and
because
aid
is
allocated
based
on
the
enrollment
at
each
participating
school
the
private
choices
of
parents
in
determining
where
to
send
their
children,
determine
the
amount
of
aid
that
each
school
receives.
in
addition,
chapter
2
does
not
provide
any
aid
that
has
an
impermissible
religious
content.
because
the
aid
is
suitable
for
use
in
public
school
it
is
also
suitable
for
use
in
any
private
school.
the
tax
payers
and
the
dissent
raised
several
arguments
that
we
reject
in
the
opinion.
first,
we
do
not
think
it
matters
under
the
establishment
clause
that
the
chapter
2
aid
is
provided
to
schools
directly
rather
than
indirectly
via
the
children.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
constitutional
difference
between
a
child
carrying
a
government
provided
computer
to
school
each
day
and
the
government
simply
giving
the
computer
directly
to
the
school
to
keep
it
there.
second,
it
does
not
matter
that
chapter
2
aid
is
divertible
to
religious
use
or
even
that
it
actually
has
been
diverted
to
such
use.
third
and
finally,
it
does
no
matter
that
many
of
the
religiously
affiliated
schools
in
jefferson
parish
could
be
described
as
pervasively
sectarian.
our
recent
cases
have
repeatedly
failed
to
give
weight
to
this
factor
and
we
think
that
the
factor
reflects
an
unwarranted
hostility
to
certain
religions.
justice
oâ€™conner
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
in
addition
to
noting
that
the
chapter
2
program
is
neutral
toward
religion
she
relies
on
several
other
aspects
of
the
program
in
order
to
conclude
that
it
is
constitutional.
she
also
concludes
that
the
evidence
of
actual
diversion
of
chapter
2
aid
is
de
minimis
and
that
therefore
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
to
question
whether
the
constitution
bars
actual
diversion
of
aid.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined.
