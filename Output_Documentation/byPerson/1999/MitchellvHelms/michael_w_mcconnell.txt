mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
constitutionality
of
government
provision
of
educational
resources
pursuant
to
neutral
statutes
depends
upon
the
medium
in
which
the
resources
are
provided.
that
is
to
say,
that
if
it's
provided
in
the
form
of
a
textbook
or
in
the
form
of
a
public
employee
providing
remedial
education
services,
it
is
constitutional,
but
if
the...
but
if
similar
material
is
provided
in
the
form
of
computer-assisted
instruction
or
library
books,
it
is
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
make
two
principal
points
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
the
distinctions
of
this
sort
have
not...
are
pedagogically
meaningless
and
counterproductive
and
have
no
relation
to
the
principles
of
the
first
amendment,
and
secondly,
that
the
criteria
laid
down
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
agostini
v.
felton,
2
years
ago,
provide
a
principal
basis
for
resolution
of
issues
of
this
sort.
the
statute
at
issue
here,
chapter
2,
was
originally
enacted
in
1965.
it
provides
for
grants
to
local
education
agencies
through
state
education
agencies
for
the
purchase
of
educational
materials
and
equipment.
today,
that
means
principally,
in
the
case
of
non-public
schools,
library
books,
computers,
computer
software,
and
an
equal
per-capita
sum
per
student
is
provided
to
the
local
education
agency
for
all
students,
no
matter
what
accredited
school
they
attend.
these
materials...
then
the
statute
provides
that
the
lea
will
then
purchase
secular,
neutral,
and
non-ideological
materials
and
equipment
which
will
then
provide
for
the
use
of
the
students
at
the
schools
where
they
attend.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that...
as
i
said,
that
the
computer-assisted
instructional
equipment
and
the
textbooks
are
unconstitutional,
relying
upon
this
court's
decisions
in
the
mid...
late
1970's,
meek
v.
pittenger
and
wolman
v.
walter.
it
is
our
submission
that
that
is
an
erroneous
decision
and
that,
under
the
criteria
in
agostini
v.
felton,
this
program
is
entirely
constitutional.
indeed,
we
don't
consider
that
this
case
is
even
particularly
difficult
because
the
statute
was
designed
in
a
particularly
careful
way
providing
safeguards
that,
if
anything,
go
beyond
any
constitutional
requirement...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
this
court
has
laid
down.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
you
actually
have
to
overrule
them.
i
think
that
the
principle
under
which
those
cases
was
decided
has
already
been
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court
in
agostini.
the
judgment
in
those
cases
could
be
sustained
because,
if
you
read
the
opinions
carefully,
you
will
see
that
the
court
presumed
in
those
cases
that
the
statutes
were
not
neutral;
that
is,
it
analyzed
the
cases
as
if
what
they
were
looking
at
were
entirely
grants
to
non-public
schools
which
were
disproportionately...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
religious
in
nature.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
plead
here
for
keeping
meek
and
wolman
alive,
which
i
consider
to
have
been
decisions
that
have
led
to
tremendous
misunderstanding
and
mischief
in
this
area
and...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
i
agree
with
you
and
justice
ginsburg
on
that.
the
court
in
meek
and
wolman
did
say
the
contrary,
however,
and
if
this
court
prefers
to
distinguish
rather
than
overrule
the
cases
on
that
ground,
it
would
be
able
to
decide
for
us
without
so
doing.
i
don't
necessarily
recommend
that.
the
three
criteria
spelled
out
in
agostini
versus...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
this
statute
does
contain
a
supplement/
not
supplant
requirement
which
is
enforced.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
constitutionally
required.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
but
we
also
do
urge
the
court
to
be...
not
to
treat
that
as
a
constitutional
requirement.
it
isn't
really
at
issue
in
this
case,
since
it
is
present,
and
there
are
contexts,
including
earlier
cases
in
this
court,
where
the...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
no,
your
honor.
all
i
would
say
is
that
it
isn't
really
necessary
for
the
court
to
consider
that...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
here.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
that's
the
place
where
some
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
seem
to
take
us...
take
a
reason...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
this
statute
is
constitutional,
and
whether
that
particular
feature
of
the
statute
is
constitutionally
required
is
not
something
i
think
that
the
court
should
decide
in
a
case
where
it
is
not
at
issue.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
is
our...
our
submission.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
however,
but
even
if
it
were,
this
stat...
this
case
would
still
come
out...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
as
we
say...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
whether
there
could...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
whether
there
is
a
complete
supplantation
is
another
question,
but
whether
there
might
be
some
degree...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
i...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
it...
it...
this
is
not,
of
course,
an
either/
or
proposition.
there
can
be
questions
of
degree.
the
position
i
would
strongly
urge
this
court
not
to
constitutionalize,
the
idea
that
any
time
any
expenditure
by
the
school
is
displaced
that
it
becomes
automatically
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
on
the
other
hand,
a
complete
supplantation
might
present
a
different
issue.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
first,
i
do...
i
believe
so
much
depends,
your
honor,
upon
the
way
a
statute
is
designed,
what
its...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
enforcement
mechanisms
are...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and
so
forth...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
but
i...
i
strongly
expect
that
the
entanglement
that
would
be
entailed
under
such
a
program
would
be
excessive.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
such
a
provision...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
be
constitutional.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the...
the
different...
may
i
explain
the
difference
between
that
and
this
case?
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
because
i
think
it
will...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
i...
well,
the
answer
is...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
do
believe
that...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
would
be...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
do
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor,
but
it's
hard
to
say
for
sure
because
it
would
depend
to
a
certain
extent
upon
the
nature
of
the
program.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
may
very
well
play
a
role,
but
as
an
absolute
rule,
your
honor,
it
would
be...
it
would...
as...
as...
if
supplement/
not
supplant
meant
that
there
could
be
no
displacing
of
any
expenditure,
however
small,
that
would
be
a...
a
very
damaging
holding.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
at
the
other
extreme...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
many
problems.
if
supplement/
supplant
were...
/
not
supplant
were
interpreted
as
an...
as
an
absolute
constitutional
rule,
you
would
have
distinctions
among
schools...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and...
and
a...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
the
three...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
three
criteria,
and
there's
not...
neutrality
is
just
one
of
the
three
criteria
laid
down
in
agostini.
the
other
two
are
that
there
may
not
be
governmental
inculcation
of
religion,
which
we
interpret
primarily
as
meaning
that
the
materials
must
be
neutral,
secular,
and
non-ideological,
and
there
must
not
be
excessive
entanglement.
when...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
again,
your
honor,
it
may
very
well
be
that
there
are
some
limitations
having
to
do
with
total
supplantation...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
where
the
government
provides
the
entire
amount.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
facts
of
this
case
are
so
far
from
that,
that
they
are
not
very
useful
and...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
what
i
would
recommend
to
you
is
that
the...
is
that
the
three
principal
criteria
of
agostini
be
reaffirmed
and
that
the
lower
courts
be
asked
to
evaluate
specific...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
statutes
and
circumstances.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
as...
as
the
government
assumes
a
larger
and
larger
share
of
the...
of
the
expenses
of
the
school,
the
entanglement
problems
grow
exponentially
because
it...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
entanglement
comes
in
the
various
conditions
and
limitations
that
are
going
to
be
attached
to
the
use
of
the
school.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
the
government
has
never
simply
said
here
is
the
school,
it's
yours.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
with
respect,
the
reason
i
resist
the
hypothesis
is
the
very
purpose
of
the
entanglement
doctrine
has
been
as
a
protection
for
the
autonomy
of
schools
that
comes
from
the
types
of
limitations
and
conditions
that
the
government
typically
attaches
to
its...
its
grants
of
aid.
it's
the...
it's
the
other
side,
the
protective
side
of
that
wall
of
separation.
to
hypothesize
that
there
are
no
limitations
or
conditions
is
contrary
to
the
very
theory
under
which
entanglement...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
makes
sense.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
is
certainly
true
that
this
isn't
going
to
occur
in
the
real
world.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
don't...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
of
course,
the
case
here
is
not
one
in
which
the
computers
can
be
used
for
whatever
you
want.
there's
specific
congressional
purposes,
narrowly
targeted
purposes
and...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
one
of
those
limitations
is,
however,
excessive
entanglement,
and
you
cannot
evaluate
the
entanglement
without
knowing
what
the...
what
the
range
of
limitations
and
conditions
are
going
to
be
on
the...
on
the
building.
may
i...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
building...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
but...
but
the
question
is
to
whom?
that
will
be
to
a
school.
well,
what
is
a
school?
there
will
be
definitions
of
what
a
school
is.
those
definitions
will
include
such
things
as
what
kind
of
content
it
has
to
do,
what
kind
of...
of
requirements
it
has
to
meet.
it
is
literally
an
impossibility
to
imagine
that
the
government
simply
says
we're
going
to
give
you
a
building
and
you
can
use
it
for
whatever
you
wanted
to.
if
it
did,
if
you
think
every
american...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
in
the
country,
a
building,
i
would
think...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
actually,
i
think
that
is...
that
is
at
least
conceivable
that,
for
example,
the
government
could
provide
a
personal
computer
to
every
student
within
certain
age
groups
in
america
to
have
at
their
own
home
and
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
entanglement
because
no
need
for
any
kind
of
limitation
on
religious
use.
again,
that's
not
the
statutory
scheme
that
we
have
here,
and
similarly,
if
the
government
wanted
to
give
a
building
to
every
person
in
the
united
states,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
to
use
the
building
for
a...
for
a
church
even.
but
if
the
government...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
there
are
also
the
other
two
aspects,
including
the
prohibition
on
governmental
indoctrination
of
religion,
and
that's,
of
course,
extremely
important
as
well.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
in
the
practical
terms
of
this
case,
because
we
have
a
supplement/
not
supplant
provision
and
we
have
very
rigorous
no
religious
use
requirements...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
you
don't
have
to
reach
either
of
those.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
it
does,
but...
but
in...
but
the
entanglement
is
so
minimal
when...
when
what
is...
when
what
is
at
stake
is
things
like
library
books
and
computers.
it's
not
something
like
teachers
or
entire
buildings
where
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
elaborate
scheme
of
monitoring.
these
are
very
discrete
pieces
of
equipment
that
are
used
for
discrete
tasks.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
relatively
simple
and
routine
matter
to
know
what
they're
being
used
for,
and
so
the
entanglement
problem
here
is,
if
anything,
less
than
in
other
cases
where...
where
this
court
has
approved
the
program.
i'd
like
to...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
there's
a
political
judgment
to
be
made
whether
legislatures
or
congress
want
to
give
aid
to
non-public
education.
when
government...
if
the
government
does
make
that
decision,
which
is
certainly
a
political
judgment
we
do
not
claim
as
a
constitutional
right
at
all,
there
are
constitutional
limitations
on
discriminating
between
secular
and
religious
private
schools,
and
so,
if
the
government
were
to
enact
a
program
which
provides
money
or
other
sorts
of
equipment
or
resources
to
private
secular
schools,
there
would
be
some
free
exercise
and
free
speech
concerns
in...
in
denying
similar
benefits
to
religious
schools.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
is
certainly
not...
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
definitely
not
our
position,
justice
ginsburg.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
essentially,
what
this
case
is
about
is
bringing
programs
of
this
sort
up...
up
to
date,
that
the
meek
and
wolman,
the
cases
upon
which
the
fifth
circuit
relied
and
the
respondents
are
mired
in
the
technology
of
the
1970's
and
the
jurisprudence
of
the
1970's...
since
that
time,
education
has
changed
and
this
court's
doctrines
have
changed.
there
may
very
well
be
limits
on...
if
the
government
in
some
hypothetical
case
which
seems
politically
extremely
unlikely
were
to
assume
total
support
for
schools,
that
would
mean
that
the
religious
elements
within
those
schools
are
being
subsidized
by
the
government,
but
that
has
not
been
enacted.
it
is
not
likely
to
be
enacted.
this
court
should
take
cases
one
at
a
time,
and
when
the
congress
passes
a
statute
that
provides
secular,
neutral,
non-ideological
equipment
and
material
for
children
on
a
neutral
basis,
that
not
only
is
not
a
constitutional
threat,
your
honors,
that
is
something
which
is
in
the
finest
tradition
of
the
first
amendment
because
it
leaves
people
free
to
be
able
to
make
educational
choices
for
themselves.
the
government
then
is
not
subsidizing
and
it
is
not
favoring
religion,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
in
the
rather
illiberal
position
of
denying
basic
technological
tools
of
the
20th
century
to
some
children
because
their
parents
have
chosen
religious
schools.
thank
you,
your
honor.
