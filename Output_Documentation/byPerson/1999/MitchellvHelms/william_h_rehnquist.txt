mr.
mcconnell...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
let's...
let's...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
a
situation
where
the...
the
county
says,
well,
we're
building
a
new
public
school
and,
just
in...
to
be
neutral,
we're
going
to
build
a
new
parochial
school,
too,
at
our
expense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
that...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's...
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
until
we
turn
this
school...
the
lock
or
the
turnkey
job
on
the
school
and
that's
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
get
to
an
answer
fairly
soon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
doesn't
that
mean
that...
that
supplant
and
supplement
perhaps
do
play
a
role
in...
in
this
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
to
police
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
shall,
mr.
mcconnell.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're...
you're...
when
you
speak
of
a
requirement,
ms.
underwood,
you're
talking
about
a
statutory...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
the
principle
you're
talking
about...
you
don't
get
in
a
sentence
all
of
the
gray
areas
and
the
gradations
that
you
might
be
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
you
have
a
lectern,
you
know,
and
you
can
put
a
secular
book
on
it
or
you
could
put
a
very
religious
book
on
it?
that...
that
doesn't
meant
that
the
lectern
needs
to
be
monitored,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
boothby,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
allen
the
first...
the
only
case
we've
ever
had
that
allowed
the
furnishing
of
textbooks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
that
make
the
point
that
the
parents
were
paying
for
the
textbooks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
cases
that
have
come
after
allen?
have
some
of
them
approved
the
grant
of
money
for
textbooks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
do
you
understand
the
termto
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are...
are
you
saying,
then,
that
any
aid
given
directly
to
the
school
rather
than
to
students
or
parents
is...
is
it
bad
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
far
would
you
go?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
give
me
an
example
of
what
you
think
would
be
permissible
in
furnishing
aid
directly
to
schools.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
playedon...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
historical...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the...
the
school
is
perfectly
free
to
accept
or
reject
aid.
you
know,
beggars
can't
be
choosers,
and
if
they
don't
want
this
aid
because
they
think
they're
having
to
suppress
religion,
they
can
say
okay,
we
won't
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
she
should
have
gone
to
the
archdiocese,
not
to
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boothby.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
the
case
is
submitted.
