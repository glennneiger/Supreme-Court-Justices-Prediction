but
why...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
you...
could...
could
you
answer
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're...
you're
talking
about...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
mr.
mcconnell.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
mcconnell...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
we
have
to
police
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
it?
suppose
you
said,
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor,
that
textbooks...
that
computers
today
are
what
textbooks
were
30
years
ago,
and
so,
really,
it's
just
an
application
of
whatever
principle
there
was
then.
you
can't
get
on
without
computers
today
in
a
school
any
more
than
you
could
get
on
without
textbooks,
and
they
can
be
regulated
so
that
they
deal
with
secular
subjects
in
roughly
the
same
way
as
textbooks
could.
so
there's
no
difference;
in
other
words,
qed
this
case.
what
do
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that...
that
in
and
of
itself...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
she...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
that
is,
according
to
your
opponents,
anyway,
that
you
had
4
years
in
discovery
and
searched
the
files
and
were
unable
to
come
up
with
one
instance
anywhere
in
which
the
computer
actually
had
been
diverted.
i'm
interested
in
your
comment
on
that
and
also
in
your
comment
on
the
san
francisco
case
where
i
think
the
san
francisco
case
involved
pretty
strict
control
so
that
the
computer
would
not
be
diverted
to
religious
teaching.
what...
what
do
you
think
of
that?
why
isn't
that
satisfactory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
here...
then...
then
that
would
be
all
right.
in
your
opinion,
the
program
would
be
like
san
francisco.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
you
have
a
supplanting
problem?
why
don't
you
ask
the
secretary
to
do
something?
because
under
the
statute
in
the
regs,
that
would
be
illegal
if
it
was
supplanting
rather
than
supplementing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
doesn't
the
program
require
supplementing
and
not
supplanting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
correct,
then
if
they're
doing
the
opposite,
don't
you
have
a
remedy
under
the
program
to
say
don't
do
it,
you're
not
following
the
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
right,
my
basic
question
is
you've
had
4
years
to
look
for
examples
of
program
violation.
the
government
would
say
you
should
have
more
time,
send
it
back
so
you
can
keep
doing
it,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
statute,
if...
isn't...
why
isn't
it
good
enough
from
your
constitutional
point
of
view
to
say,
well,
we
have
a
remedy
under
this
statute,
if
either
of
these
things
is
going
on,
diversion
or
supplementation,
and
we
would
assume
that
the
statute
corrects
for
that?
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
