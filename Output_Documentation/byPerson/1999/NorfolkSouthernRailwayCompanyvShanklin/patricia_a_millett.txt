mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
25
years,
the
secretary
has
administered
the
minimum
warning
sign
requirement
in
section
130(d),
a
congressional
mandate,
as
a
distinct
program
separate
and
apart
from
its
regulatory
scheme
under
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
that
determines
what
level
of
protection
is
adequate
at
an
individual
crossing
to
make
it
safe.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
easterwood
was
so
far
beyond
the
minimum
program...
it
was
a
situation
where
individual
study
had
already
been
done--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
it
wasn't
remotely
at
issue
in
the
case.
it
hadn't
come
up.
no
one
had
addressed--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there
are
an
awful
lot
of
highway
programs
that
are
covered
and
administered
by
the
secretary.
they
weren't
addressed.
now,
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
to
have
spent
some
time
discussing
this
in
our
brief
in
easterwood.
we
did,
at
the
end
of
our
discussion
section,
note
that
crossbucks
have
a
special
status,
that
crossbucks
had
a
special
status
in
the
manual
for
purpose
of
preemption.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
did
do
that
in
our
brief,
but
we
did
not
go
on
at
length
about
this
program.
but
the
issue
is
that
we
now
are
sitting
here
in
the
year
2000
looking
back
at
what
happened
for
25
years--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely,
and
the
first
thing
is
the
practice
of
the
state.
if,
if
they
thought
it
was
governed
by
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
they
would
have
to,
as
texas'
brief
explains
quite
well,
have
sent
out
a
diagnostic
team
to
do
an
engineering
study--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--for
purposes
of
a
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
determin...
because
you're
not
going
to
get
the
money
from
the
secretary
unless
you
submit
an
engineering
study
of
that
individual
crossing.
23
c.f.r.
924.9(a)(3)
requires
the
engineering
study.
the
manual
on
uniform
traffic
code
devices
says
engineering
studies
will
be
done.
the
railway-highway
grade
crossing
handbook,
which
all
the
states
have,
says
the
engineering
study
will
be
done.
you
do
not
get
funds
under
(b)(3)(b)(4)
without
going
out,
looking
at
the
individual
crossing,
and
deciding
what
is
needed,
not
for
minimum
protection,
but
to
make
that
crossing
safe.
that
is
not
what
happened
under
the
minimum
program.
that
was
the
normal
operating
procedure
of
the
department
of
transportation,
but
when
congress
said
in
130(d)
at
a...
this
is
going
to
take
a
long
time.
it's
going
to...
congress...
texas
has
11,500
crossings,
do
about
150
crossings
a
year.
it
would
take
them
100
years
just
to
get
to
every
crossing
and
just
to
put
up
the
minimum
if
they
studied
it
the
way
you
do
for
(b)(3)(b)(4).
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
didn't
happen.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
need
the
secretary's
approval
for
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
well,
first
of
all,
23
c.f.r.
part
630
addresses
the
general
need
for
a
secretary's
authorization
for
federal
funds.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
don't
believe
it's
reproduced
in
the
briefs.
it's
just
the
general
regulations
governing...
this
is
a
big
highway
contract
program.
the
general
regulations
saying
that
you
need
federal
aid
project
authorization
are
at...
reproduced
at...
are
at
23
c.f.r.--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
not
that
it's
a
separate
program.
that's
the
general
requirement
that
to
get
money
under
a
highway
program
out
of
the
secretary,
it
has
to
be
authorized
by
the
secretary.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
uh-huh.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
unfortunately
i'm
not
even...
that's...
those
aren't
the
words,
either.
i
don't
mean
to
split
on
words.
everything
has
to
be
authorized
and
has
to
be
approved,
but
the
question
is,
what
was
approved?
did
we
approve
under
(b)(3)(b)(4)
determination
of
what
is
adequate
to
protect
an
individual
crossing--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there's
two
things
that
we
can
approve.
we
can
approve
an
authorization
under
(b)(3)(b)(4)
for
funding
to
install
the
protective
devices
at
a
crossing
that
will
make
that
individual
crossing
safe,
based
on
individualized
study.
we
can
also,
pursuant
to
congressional
mandate,
authorize
the
installation
of
a
fuller
federal
protection--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
it
doesn't
make
it
adequate,
and
this
is...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
just
want
to
say,
this
is...
we
have
a
directly
different
response
to
your
question
to
mr.
phillips,
and
that
was
does
the
secretary
have
the
ability
to
approve
just
a
federal
minimum
program
that
doesn't
determine
what
is
adequate,
and
that,
yes
we
have
the
ability
because
congress
said
so
in
23
u.s.c.
130(d),
so
that
is
the
exception
to
the
normal
rule.
the
normal
rule
is,
you
want
the
money,
you
do
an
individualized
study
and
show
us
what's
going
to
make
it
safe.
the
exception
is
the
minimum
protection
program.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
two
answers.
first
is,
we
don't
read
easterwood
as
making
everything
turn
on
federal
funding
and,
in
fact,
the
court
didn't.
there
was
federal
funding
of
the
crossing.
it
said
it
wasn't
protected.
the
question
is...
the
question
in
easterwood
that
this
court
adopted
i
think
was
a
quite
pragmatic
and
correct
rule
that
was
consistent
with
our
position
here,
and
that
is,
was
money
spent
to
make
an
individual
crossing
safe?
they
tried
to
argue
in
easterwood,
well,
there
was
a
grouping
here
of
crossings,
and
that
was
enough
to
make
it
safe,
and
this
court
said
the
program
cast
doubt
on
that,
that
the
individual
crossing
hadn't
been
made
safe
with
the
federal
funds.
the
second
part--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
it
is
not
to
make
that
crossing
safe
in
the
same
way
that
state
tort
law
makes
that
crossing
safe,
or
any
state
law--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
makes
a
crossing
safe.
it
is
to
make
it
less
unsafe.
any
interim--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
what...
for
purposes
of
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
what
adequate
warning
devices
are,
are
designed
to
address
what
makes
an
individual
crossing
safe
in
the
same
way
that
state
law
had
for
hundreds
of
years
before.
the
question
is
whether
that
has
been
displaced.
when...
in
easterwood
you
set
up
a
rule
that
said,
when
there's
been
federal
funding
on
a
particular
crossing
that
makes
that
crossing
safe,
we
will
not
allow...
we'll
have
preemption
because
you
don't
want
a
jury
second-guessing
that
federalized
decision.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
may
i
answer?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
because
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)...
(b)(4)
is
a
direct
outgrowth
of
(b)(3).
it
is
only
focused
on
determining
what
is
adequate
to
make
a
particular
crossing
safe
under
the
circumstances
and
conditions
of
that
crossing.
it
has
no
application
to
the
uniform
floor
of
safety
accomplished
by
the
minimum
program.
