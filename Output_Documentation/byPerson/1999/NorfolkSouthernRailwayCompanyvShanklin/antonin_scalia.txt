mr.
phillips,
did
the
solicitor
general
support
the
outcome
that
we
reached
in
easterwood?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
outcome.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
support
the
rationale?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
having
persuaded
us
that
that
was
correct,
the
solicitor
general
now
wants
to
persuade
us
that
it's
not
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
word...
doesn't
it
hinge
on
what
the
word
determination
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
you
possibly
read
determination
to
refer
to
adequacy?
where
the
requirement
of
64...
646.214
be...
are
not
applicable,
the
type
of
warning
device
to
be
installed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
the
determination
is
made
by
a
state
or
regulatory
agency
is
subject
to
the
approval
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
word
determination
there
obviously
means
the
determination
of
the
type
of
warning
device
to
be
installed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
deny
that.
i
am
just
focusing
on
whether
the
word
determination
in
(4)
refers
to
adequacy
or
refers
to
the
type
of
device
to
be
installed,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
clearly
refers
to
the
type
of
device
to
be
installed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
state
says,
even
though
we
think
this
device
is
not
adequate,
just
between
you
and
me,
we're
going
to
install
it.
that
has
been
the
determination
made
by
the
state,
and
it
would
be
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
to
upgrade
even
where
it's
not
required?
aren't
you...
you're
required
to
have
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
he
can
look
through
the
statistics
that
you've
generated
as
to
the
traffic,
as
to
the
nearness
of
high
schools
and
all
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
on
the
basis
of
that
determine
that
this
is
not
a
place
that
in
his
view
requires
an
automatic
signal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
has
no
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
approval
is
required.
if
he
does
nothing,
he
approves?
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
accepts
it
and
gives
the
funding,
does
that
mean
that
he
approves?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
the
secretary
do
nothing
and
just
say,
i...
you
know,
may
be
good,
may
be
bad.
i
neither
approve
nor
disapprove.
i
am
neutral.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
the
position...
your
opponents
claim
that
the
position
that
you're
asserting
here
was
not
the
position
that
you
took
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
as
to
the
outcome
of
course
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
thought
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
i
understand
who
you
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
now,
i
may
be
wrong
about
what's
asserted
in
the
opposing
briefs,
but
i
thought
they
asserted
that
with
respect
to
you
it's
a
new
position
as
well.
they
assert
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you
go
along
with
the
government's
division
of
(3)
and
(4)
into
minimums
and
then
those
areas
where
you
need
on-site
inspections
to
go
above
the
minimums.
that's
not
the
position
you
took
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that
comes
to
whether
the
money
could
have...
can
be
given.
i
thought
that
the
money
can't
be
given
unless
there
are
adequate
warning
devices.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
need
on-site
inspection
to
determine
whether
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
(e)
and
(f)
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't...
i
really
don't
understand.
you're
saying
you
can
tell,
sitting
in
your
office,
from
this
mass
of
statistics,
that
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
(e),
and
(f)
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
not
all
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
tell
that
they
don't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
authorized
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
sg's
position,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
since
he's
authorized
to
do
it,
i
assume
they're
entitled
to
those
funds
whether
or
not
he
approves
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldstein,
you
know,
normally
when
we
interpret
a
statute
it's
interpreted.
we
don't
come
back
and
reinterpret
it.
we
go
on
to
the
next
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
have...
what
we
said
in
easterwood
was
this,
and
how
does
it
fit
in
with
your
theory?
in
short,
for
projects
in
which
federal
funds
participate,
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
reading
on
page
11
from...
what
i
have
is
from
lawyer's
edition.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
projects
in
which
federal
funds
participate
in
the
installation
of
warning
devices,
not
just
those
which
involve
federal
highways,
the
secretary
has
determined
the
devices
to
be
installed
and
the...
has
determined
devices
to
be
installed
and
the
means
by
which
railroads
are
to
participate
in
their
selection.
the
secretary's
regulations
therefore
cover
the
subject
matter
of
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
projects
in
which
federal
funds
participate
is
what
it
said.
it
did
not
draw
a
distinction
between
those
projects
that
involve
federal
highways
and
those
that
don't
involve
federal
highways.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
millett,
would
this
have
been
relevant
to
our
decision
in
easterwood?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
there
are
two
programs,
a
minimum
program
and
then
some
supplemental
program,
was
certainly
relevant
to
the
preemption
decision
in
easterwood,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
at
issue...
it
was
relevant
to
the
general
issue
of
preemption
and
when
preemption
occurs.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
millett--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
might
have
been
the
holding,
but
that
was
not
our
general
language.
our
general
language
was
federal
funding,
it's
covered.
can
i
ask
you
about
(4)?
if
there
is
this
two-level
thing,
minimum
plus,
one
would
have
expected
(4)
not
to
say,
for
crossings
where
the
requirements
of
(3)
are
not
applicable
the
type
of
warning
device
to
be
installed,
whether
the
determination
is
made
by
a
state,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
is
subject
to
the...
it
makes
it
sound
as
though
the
determination
of
what
warning
device
to
be
installed
is
up
to
the
state,
or
you
know,
so
long
as
it
gets
the
approval
of
hw...
fhwa.
you
would
think
it
would
have
said
somewhere
in
(4),
the
type
of
warning
device
to
be
installed,
so
long
as
it
meets
the
minimum
requirements
of
130
whatever
it
is,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
reference
to
the
minimum
at
all.
it
says,
the
type
to
be
installed,
as
though
it's
entirely
up
to
the
state
agency.
why
isn't
there
some
reference
to
the
minimum
in
(4)?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
the
argument
that
109
only
applies
to
federal
aid
highways?
