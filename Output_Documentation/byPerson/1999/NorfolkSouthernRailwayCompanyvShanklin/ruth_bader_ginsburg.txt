mr.
phillips,
you
started
with
discussion
of
the
easterwood
case,
and
that
was
a
case
that
held
there
was
no
preemption,
yet
you're
using
it
to
support
your
position
that
there
is
preemption.
now,
no
doubt
that
case
held
federal
assistance
is
necessary
to
preemption,
but
it
never
homed
in
on
the
kind
of
crossing
protection
involved
here,
that
is,
simply
the
sign.
there
was...
the
court
was
looking
at
an
upgraded...
was
it
not?
it
wasn't
a
simple
sign,
but
it
was
some
kind
of
a
gate
that
was
involved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
originally
a
proposal
not
for
a
simple
sign,
but
for
gates.
then
that
was
transferred
to
some
place
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all...
my
only
point
is
that
the
court
was
not
looking
at
what
we
have
before
us
today.
that
is,
funding
simply
of
a
sign.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
held
there
was
no
preemption,
and
i'm
a
little
troubled
at
the
idea
of
taking
a
case
that
held
there
was
no
preemption
in
that
case
to
establish
beyond
question
that
there
is
preemption
in
a
case
that
was
not
before
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
secretary
decided
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
every
crossing
meet
at
least
a
minimum
standard,
there
would
be
no
way
to
do
that
without
affecting
preemption,
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
couldn't...
the
secretary
couldn't
say,
in
your
view,
we
don't
want
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
detailed
analysis,
we
just
want
to
say
universally
every
crossing
will
have
at
least
the
minimum
sign?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
these
regulations
the
secretary--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
not
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
these
regulations,
the
secretary
could
say...
couldn't
say,
without
looking
at
any
particular
crossing,
we
are
going
to
require
every
crossing
to
have
at
least
the
minimum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
making
a
distinction
between
authorized
and
approval,
then.
you
say
everything
has
to
be
authorized.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
approval
relates
to
a
specific
crossing.
that's
what
you
seem
to
be
saying.
authorize,
the
secretary
must
authorize
any
spending
of
federal
funds,
but
the
word
approval
has
a
narrower
meaning,
and
it
relates
to
a
specific
crossing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
authorized
something.
you
authorized--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
spending
of
federal
funds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
floor
is
in
the
regulations,
that
there's
no
lack
of
statutory
authority
for
the
secretary
to
do
what
mr.
goldstein
contends
the
secretary
did
do?
