justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
preemption
occurs
when
the
devices
are
installed
and
the...
pursuant
to
the
federal
program,
and
the
money's
paid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
point
at
which
preemption
occurs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
23
u.s.c.
109
that
says
that
federal...
which
is
at
40a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
at
the
top
of
the
page.
it
says,
no
funds
shall
be
approved
for
expenditure
unless
proper
safety
devices
complying
with
safety
standards
determined
by
the
secretary
at
the
time
as
being
adequate
shall
be
installed.
does
the
intersection
that's
involved
in
this
case,
the
oak
church
intersection,
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
highways
covered
by
23
u.s.c.
109?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on-system
meaning
a
federal
aid
highway
or
a
highway
affected
under
chapter
2?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
now,
this
crossing
in
question
was
identified
as
one
of
i
think
196
crossings
for
which
federal
funds
were
sought,
and
are
you
saying
that
the
secretary
approved
funds
for
inadequate
safety
devices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
196
list
included
this
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
included
oak
church
specifically.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
secretary
approved
federal
funds
for
the
installation
of
those
devices
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
government
approved
funds
for
the
installation
of
inadequate
safety
devices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
it
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
he
can
do
that
consistently
with
(b)(4),
or
that
(b)(4)
is
simply
inapplicable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
please
give
me
the
page
number?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
saying
that
what
the
state
did
not
do
here
was?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
that
disputed
by
some
later
lodging,
the
cantrell
deposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
farris
was
an
employee
of
the
tennessee
department
of
transportation,
and
he
wrote
that
after
he
visited
the
crossing
no
signs
were
needed.
why
are
you
telling
me
that
they...
there
was
no
visit
by
a
state
employee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
see,
this
is
why
i
have
some
sympathy
for
the
railroad.
you're
arguing
that
there's
a
separate
program,
and
we
don't
even
have
the
regulations
in
front
of
us.
