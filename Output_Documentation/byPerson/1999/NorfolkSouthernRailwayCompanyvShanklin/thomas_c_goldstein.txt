mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position,
as
several
of
the
questions
have
identified,
is
that
the
government
did
not
determine
that
minimum
protection
devices
would
be
adequate
to
protect
the
oakwood
church
road
crossing
and,
to
put
that
in
the
language
of
the
preemption
provision
of
the
federal
railroad
safety
act,
no
federal
regulation
or
order,
quote-unquote,
covers
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
law
duty
here,
which
is
to
provide
an
adequate
warning
under
the
circumstances
at
the
crossing
of
the
approach
of
a
train.
now,
we
are
joined
in
that
view
both
by
the
federal
government,
whose
regulations
or
orders
are
involved,
and
also
the
testimony
of
the
tennessee
state
official
who
ran
the
program
in
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct,
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but
i
think
justice
scalia
is
correct.
he
understands
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no--
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
understand
there
to
be
any
tension
between
our
position
below
and
here
whatsoever.
our
position
is
that
you
have
to...
the
government
has
to
have
decided
what's
adequate
here
if
it's
going
to
cover
the
subject
matter
of
a
state
law
duty
to
provide
an
adequate
warning.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
what
we
explained
below
is
that
this
is
a
crossing,
if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
just...
let's
go
to
the
regulations
which
are
the
only
ones
they're
alleged
to
preempt
here--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--is
that
at
the
very
least,
even
if
these
regulations
were
applicable,
they
weren't
complied
with,
because
the
district
court
explained
that
the
conditions
set
out,
if
we
could
just
turn
to
the
cert
petition
47a
in
the
appendix,
there's
a
list
of
six
or
seven
conditions
there,
and
what
the
district
court
said,
and
we
supported
that
view
on
appeal,
is
look,
these
conditions
existed
at
this
crossing.
the
state
never
went
out
and
considered
what
were...
what
was
the
situation
at
the
crossing,
and
so
there
was
never
a
determination
by
the
state
that
what
happened
here,
that
the
minimum
protection
devices
they
installed
were,
in
fact,
adequate,
and
we're
saying
the
same
thing
here,
except
we
have
even
a
brighter
line
that's
suggested
both
by
the
opinion
below
and
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and
that
is
not
correct,
and
let
me
just
get
right
to
the
nub
of
it.
the...
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
as
the
solicitor
general
has
explained,
don't
apply
to
this
crossing
at
all,
and
let
me
explain
why.
what
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
are,
are
provisions
that
guide
determinations
of
individual
crossings.
you
go
out,
you
study
your
crossing
with
an
expert
team,
and
you
look
at
these
conditions
in
(b)(3),
and
if
these
conditions
exist,
then
you
have
to
put
up
lights
and
gates
unless
the
engineering
team
tells
you
otherwise,
and
if
these
conditions
don't
exist,
under
(b)(4)
the
secretary
gets
to
decide
what
it
is
you're
going
to
put
up.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
that's
the
only
way
you'll
ever
know.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but
(b)(4)
is
the
negative.
you...
i
can
tell
you,
based
on
a
statistical
analysis,
whether
or
not
there
are
high-speed
trains,
sure,
and
they
were
here.
the
trains
traveled
at
a
maximum
speed
of
60
miles
an
hour.
what
i
can't
do,
without
going
to
the
crossing,
is
make
the
judgment
about
these
conditions
all
not
being
there.
you
have
to
go
out
and
study
the
combinations
that
are
evaluated
here,
and
in
addition
the
most
critical
conditions
aren't
available
to
anyone,
and
that...
without
going
out
to
the
crossing,
and
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--some
of
them.
some
of
them,
that
there
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
there
are
multiple
mainline
railroad
tracks.
there's
a
piece
of
data
about
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
you
cannot
tell
that
other
of
the
conditions
do
not
exist,
and
the
most
particular
example
is
the
sight
distance.
you
cannot
tell,
just
sitting
in
your
office,
and
the
state's
hazard
index
does
not
evaluate
whether
a
driver
who
comes
up
to
the
crossing
can
see
the
train
in
time
to
stop.
and
let
me
just
point
you
to
the
testimony
about
this,
and
what
it
is
that
the
state
actually
was
doing
here
as
the
delegatee
of
the
federal
government.
tennessee's
official
who
ran
this
program
explained
that
when
they
put
these
minimum
protection
devices
up
they
were
not
evaluating
the
conditions
of
the
crossing.
this
is
in
the
red
brief
at
pages
31
to
35,
and
i
will
point
you
just
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
that.
this
testimony
is
about
the
tennessee
program
writ
large,
what
it
is
that
they
were
doing
under
their
minimum
protection
program,
and
let
me
just
detour
briefly
to
explain
that
mr.
phillips
is
not
correct
when
he
says
that
this
is
somehow
just
unique
to
tennessee.
as
the
federal
government's
brief
explains,
every
single
state
in
the
country
tracks
separately
and
had
separate
minimum
protection
programs
and
a
separate
program
dealing
with
adequacy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me
say
first
that
it
is,
of
course,
more
than
196.
196
were
done
at
once,
but
there
were
actually--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
and
here
is
why.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
in
fact
there's
a
congressional
mandate.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me
deal
with
two
separate
statutes
and
a
regulation.
109,
the
only
provision
in
question
is
109(e),
and
the
clause
that
mr.
coleman
was
referring
to
you,
there's
a
provision
that
says
on
every
federal
aid
highway
you
can
only
install
adequate
warning
devices.
this
is
not
a
federal
aid
highway,
and
i
will
point
you
to
the
supplemental
lodging
of
the
petitioner.
the
last
document
in
there
explains
that
this
is
an
off-system
crossing.
it
is
a
local,
rural
road,
and
it
was
not
required
to
comply
with
109(e).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
chapter
2
is
in
the
main
things
like
indian
lands.
it
doesn't
apply
here,
if
the
court
goes
and
reviews
chapter
2.
there's
no
allegation
by
the
petitioner.
to
return
to
justice
kennedy,
whether
or
not
there's
a
statutory
and
regulatory
authority
for
the
federal
government
to
approve
minimum
protection
devices
that
are
not
adequate,
it
is
in
23
u.s.c.
130(d),
which
is
reprinted
in
the
red
brief
at
page
4
at
the
top.
it's
the
first
block
quote.
this
is
the
statute
that
set
up
the
hazard
program
that
mr.
coleman
refers
to
that's
in
the
regulations
at
part
924,
and
if
i
could
again,
while
you're
looking
this
up,
detour
briefly
to
note
that
the
court
unanimously
held
in
easterwood
that
the
program
under
which
mr.
coleman
is
relying
was
not
preemptive.
it
was
just
a
way
to
rationalize
the
spending
of
federal
funds.
to
return
back
to
the
statute,
there
are
two
things
in
it,
and
let
me
just
briefly
put
this
in
context.
the
secretary
of
transportation
went
to
congress
in
1971
and
1972
and
said,
look,
we've
got
a
real
problem.
we've
got
thousands
upon
tens
of
thousands
of
crossings
that
aren't
protected.
we've
only
got
so
much
money.
we
think
that
you
need
to
set
out
funding
on
an
annualized
basis
so
that
we
can
protect
more
crossings
every
year,
but
in
the
meantime,
we
have
to
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
below...
the
last
sentence,
at
a
minimum--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize,
justice
kennedy.
page
4
of
the
red
brief.
the
first
block
quote,
the
last
sentence.
130(d)
says,
at
a
minimum,
such
a
schedule,
which
is
the
schedule
of
improvements,
shall
provide
signs
for
all
railway
highway
crossings.
that
is,
congress
said,
at
the
very
least,
everything
has
got
to
have
standard
signs
without
regard
to
the
conditions.
the
next
block
quote
is
the
secretary's
implementation
of
that.
remember,
i
did
stop
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
this
is
implementing
the
secretary's
recommendation
that
we
need
to
install
adequate
warning
devices
as
federal
funds
become
available,
but
in
the
meantime,
because
that's
going
to
take
so
long,
we
need
a
finger
in
the
dike.
we've
at
least
got
to
get
standard
signs
up
at
every
crossings,
at
every
crossing.
and
what
mr.
coleman
doesn't
tell
you
is
that
texas
every
year
upgrades
only
150
of
its
12,000
crossings.
justice
breyer,
you
don't
have
to
get
down
to
number
8,617
to
figure
out
that
the
state
has
not
stepped
in
and
determined
what's
adequate.
you
can
get
down
to
number
1,000
or
2,000.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
every
single
state
has
this
program,
and
every
single
state
has
taken
money
under
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
is
a
directive
from
the
federal
highway
administration.
it
is
the
next
block
quote
on
the
same
page,
and
the
directive
explains,
as...
and
i'm
starting...
you
can
start
wherever
you
like
in
it,
but
i'll
start
at
the
beginning.
section
203(a)
of
the
highway
safety
act
of
1973,
which
is
130(d),
requires
as
a
minimum
that
each
state's
schedule
of
improvements
shall
provide
signs
at
all
crossings.
as
a
first
priority,
each
state,
in
cooperation
with
the
involved
railroad
and
any
other
agency
having
jurisdiction,
shall
identify
those
grade
crossings
at
which
they
are
either
no
signs,
or
nonstandard
signs,
and
institute
an
improvement
program
to
provide
signing
and
pavement--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
because
(b)(3)
is...
and
(b)--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--just
breyer,
if
i
could
just--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--point
out,
as
easterwood
twice
explains,
(b)(4)
is
just...
is
triggered
only
by
(b)(3).
it
says,
when
these
conditions
in
(b)(3)
don't
exist,
then
you
go
to
(b)(4).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
the
federal
highway
program
manual.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
not
a
regulation.
it
is
a
program
manual
that
is
given
as
guidance
to
every
single
state
on
administering
the
federal--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--as
a
matter
of
deference
to
the
secretary
that
may
well
be
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
let
me
just
tell
you
what
really
is
at
issue.
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
you
should
defer
to
the
secretary's
interpretation.
you
are
being
asked
to
say
what
happened,
because
this
is
over.
this
program
was
administered
by
the
secretary
from
1973
to
the
early
nineties,
and
it's
now
done.
they're
not
asking
for
permission
to
do
this
going
forward.
they're
explaining
to
you
what
did
happen
in
the
seventies,
eighties,
and
early
nineties,
and
what
they
were
doing--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because
this
was
the
guidance
that
they
issued,
and
this
is
the
guidance--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
regulation,
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--just
as
the
regulation
was
issued
in
1975,
this
is
the
guidance
that
the
agency
gave
in
response
to
the
statute,
and
it
hasn't
been
repealed
in
any
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
what
the
states
were
supposed
to
do,
and
as
the
testimony
collected
here
explains,
that's
in
fact
what
the
state
did.
justice
stevens,
if
i
could
also
return
to
your
question
about,
well,
what
would
happen
to
texas
and
to
the
other
states
if
the
railroad
were
to
prevail.
the
real
answer
is
the...
that
state
regulation
and
state
decisionmaking
about
what's
necessary
to
protect
crossings
would
be
preempted.
texas...
remember
that
the
statute
preempts
all
state
orders,
laws,
or
regulations.
this
is
section
201.06,
the
preemption
provision
at
issue,
and
it
would
tell
texas
they
cannot
regulate
this
crossing
any
more
because
they,
like
tennessee,
like
every
other
state,
spent
federal
money
to
put
out
minimum
protection
signs
without
any
indication
that
those
signs
would
be
adequate
to
protect
the
crossing.
what
tennessee
did
not
do,
and
it
is
unquestioned
that
they
didn't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
would
be
the
only
way.
they
could
only--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they
could,
but
for
example,
justice
o'connor,
what
they
could
not
do
would
be
to
come
in
and
say,
we've
determined
that
several
thousand
crossings
actually
need
a
fourth
or
a
fifth
warning
sign.
they
can
only
act
from
henceforth
as
the
delegatee
of
the
federal
government.
their
own
independent
decisionmaking
and
regulatory
authority
is
displaced.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
what
they
did
not
do
is
send
out
anyone
on
their
own
or
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
as
the
delegatee
under
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--there
is
one
letter
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
does
not
dispute
my
point.
what
(b)(3)
would
require,
and
this
hazard
program
would
require,
is
at
the
time
you
go
out--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
what
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
require
is
someone
go
out
and
determine
what
warning
devices
are
necessary.
the
letter
simply
doesn't
say
what
it
is
that
you're...
what
your
adverting
to.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
supplemental
lodging
of
the
petitioner
at
the
end
of
tab
c,
and
what
it
says
is
only...
there's
a
letter
from
a
congressman
that
asks
tennessee,
is
this
high
enough
up
on
your
priority
program
to
spend
the
limited
federal
funds
available
to
install
lights
and
gates,
and
he
answers,
this
crossing
does
not
have
sufficient
train-vehicle
exposure
to
qualify
for
active
warning
devices.
he
does
not
say
that
minimum
protection
devices
would
be
adequate,
and
he
doesn't
say
that
we
actually
looked
and
decided
what
was
necessary
to
protect
this
crossing.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
671
of
the
u.s.
reports.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
that
is
a
description
of
how
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
work
when
it
is
applied.
you
have
to
look
at
the
eight
sentences,
the
entire
paragraph
that
precedes
it.
it
explains
that
when
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
are
applicable,
then
the
federal
government
won't
send
out
the
money
unless
they've
determined
that
the
warning
devices
are
adequate.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
what
i'm
saying,
justice
scalia,
is,
the
sentence
that
you
are
reading
describes
(b)(3)(b)(4).
it
is
not
setting
forth
a
rule
of
law,
and
i
will
give
you
an
example.
if
the
federal
government
gave
the
petitioner
a
loan
of
[$]
50
million
and
therefore
federal
funds
would
participate
in
the
installation
of
warning
devices,
the
court
was
not
saying
that
would
be
preemptive.
what
the
court
is
saying
is,
when
the
decisionmaking
process
set
out
in
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
is
followed,
when
we
do
look
at
the
crossings,
then
we
really
have
done
what
the
common
law
does.
we
have
gone
out
and
determined
what
warning
devices
will
adequately
warn
the
individuals
of
the
approach
of
a
train,
but
when
all
you
do
is
go
to
tens
of
thousands
of
crossings,
and
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
simply
stick
up
signs
which
warns
that
a
track
is
ahead,
not
that
a
train
is
ahead,
and
you
don't
care
at
all
what
the
conditions
were
at
the
crossing,
then
you
haven't
done
that.

it

is

money,
the

has
to
authorize
the

of
the
money.

the
