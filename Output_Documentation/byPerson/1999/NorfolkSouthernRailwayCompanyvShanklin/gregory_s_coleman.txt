mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
i'd
like
to
begin
with
your
question.
the
main
concern
here
is,
what
are
you
doing?
why
should
we
allow
a
preemption
if
you're
just
putting
in
crossbucks
without
any
independent
determination
of
whether
that's
good
enough?
and
the
reason
that
that
should
not
be
a
concern
to
this
court
is
that
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
are
attempting
to
get
the
court
to
look
at
this
particular
aspect
of
the
crossings
program,
when
you
go
through
and
make
sure
that
all
the
crossings
have
at
least
crossbucks.
what
they're
forgetting
about
is
the
rest
of
the
crossings
program.
part
924
requires
the
states
to
have
a
prioritization
scheme
which
collects
astounding
amounts
of
data
about
each
of
these
crossings.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it's
in
the
same...
23
c.f.c.
6...
part
924
generally
describes
the
process
by
which
you
create,
or
collect
the
data
about
the
crossings
and
then
crunch
it
through,
and
you
have
a
prioritization
scheme.
it's
basically
a
mathematical
formula
that
collects
data
about
these.
the
railroads
are
required
to
give
the
states
data.
the
states
collect
their
own
data.
they
crunch
the
numbers
and
they
come
up
with
a
priority
score
for
each
crossing.
the
states
then,
every
year,
look
at
all
of
the
crossings
and
find
where
the
crossings
have
the
highest
hazard
risk.
let's
go
and
do
active
device
conversions
of
those
crossings,
and
that's
what
we
do.
now,
in
texas,
for
instance,
we
get
approximately
[$]
22
million
a
year
for
this
program.
in
texas,
we
could
go
to
every
passive
device
crossing
in
the
state
and
put
in
new
crossbucks
and
what-not
every
single
year
and
only
use
about
a
third
of
our
money.
so
if
we
did
a
state-wide
crossings
program,
which
we're
actually
getting
ready
to
do
another
one
to
upgrade
a
lot
of
the
crossbucks,
we
still
have
about
two-thirds
of
our
money
to
go
down
the
survey
and
determine
which
crossings
have
the
highest
relative
risk,
where
do
we
want
to
spend
the
money
that
we
have
to
upgrade
from
crossbucks
to
active
devices,
and
in
texas
that's
almost
always
gates
and
flashers,
the
(b)(3)
type
devices.
that's
why
it
should
not
be
a
concern.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
upgrade
even
where
it's
not
specifically
required
by
(b)(3).
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
have
in
texas
about
12,000
public
crossings.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
justice
breyer,
that's
ultimately
the
question
in
this
case,
who
gets
to
decide
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
concern,
and
the
concern
expressed
in
shots
and
shanklin
is
that
the
states
aren't
doing
a
good
job
in
prioritizing
crossings
and
putting
in
active
devices
where
the--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
simply
not
the
case
in
texas
or
in
other
states.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i'm
not
saying
that
there
are
no
bad
crossings,
but
this
program
is
nearly
30
years
old.
we
have
12,000
crossings.
we
have
approximately
4,500
crossings
in
texas
with
active
devices.
texas
has
thousands
of
rural
crossings
that
have
very
low
priority
index
scores,
but
the
types
of
crossings
we
believe,
and
the
people
at
our
department
of
transportation
believe
the
types
of
crossings
that
absolutely
require
active
devices
under
(b)(3)
were
covered
long,
long
ago.
what
we're
talking
about
now
is
relative
risk
relating
to
vehicle
traffic,
train
traffic,
speeds
of
trains,
and
we
simply
go
down
the
list
each
year
and
choose
those
crossings
that
have
the
highest
risk,
and
then
we
convert
them
to
active
devices,
and
even
if
we
did
a
state-wide
project,
we
still
have
two-thirds
of
our
money
for
that
year
to
do
that,
so
if
you
think
about
it--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
think
it
does.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
this
is
an
excellent
federal-state
cooperation
program
that
has
worked
well--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it
has
worked
very
well.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
safety
statistics
have
dramatically
improved
over
the
past
30
years,
and
fatality
rates
have
plummeted
during
the
time
this
project...
program--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
the
sixth
circuit
determination
in
this
case
is
correct,
that
there
must
be
a
separate
federal
determination
regarding
the
adequacy
of
all
the
devices,
we
think
that
that
will
divert
resources.
we,
the
states,
are
already
doing
these
determinations.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
believe
it
will
divert
federal
resources,
because
it
will
be
the
federal
government
that
will
have
to
make
independent
determinations.
the
federal
government
will
start
sending
out,
or
having
to
send
out
duplicative
diagnostic
teams,
what-not.
that
is
money--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
believe
you
can
say
nobody
has
said
it's
adequate,
because
in
any
given
year...
for
instance,
if
texas
does
a
state-wide
crossings
program,
it
still
has
two-thirds
of
that
money.
it
looks
down
the
survey
list
regarding
the
relative
priorities
and
it
makes
a
determination
as
to
which
crossings
will
receive
active
devices
and
which
crossings
won't.
that
determination--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
i
think
my--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
my
argument
is
entirely
consistent
with
mr.
phillips.
the
states
make
the
determination
as
an
initial
matter.
they
are
submitted
to
the
federal
highway
administration
for
approval
under
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4).
we
believe
that
all
of
these
programs
are
submitted
under
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
and
are
submitted
for
approval
and,
as
he
noted,
the
fact
that
the
secretary
approves
most
of
these
programs
suggests
that
the
secretary
does
have
confidence
in
the
state's
ability
to
evaluate
these
crossings.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
secretary
has
discretion
to
do
as
little
or
as
much
background
check
or
updating
of
the
state's
numbers
as
he
or
she
wants.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
believe
that
the
regulation--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
the
regulations,
the
secretary
may
approve,
disapprove,
the
secretary
may
qualify
approval,
the
secretary
may
condition
approval
on
changes
being
made.
i
believe
the
secretary--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
think
that
federal
funds
can
be
used
unless
there's
an
approval.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there's
some
question
about
whether
the
text
of
that
provision
applies.
we
believe
that
the
spirit
does,
because
the
programs
were
brought
together
in
the
seventies.
importantly,
the
federal
highway
administration
has
never
made
any
distinction
between
on-system
or
off-system
crossings.
the
states,
when
they
submit
projects,
include
both
on-system
and
off-system
for
approval.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
justice
kennedy.
we
believe
that
when
the
states
make
these
determinations
the
secretary
is
expressing
approval
of
the
devices.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
thank
you.
