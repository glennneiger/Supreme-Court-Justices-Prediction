justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
has
the
secretary
determined
the
devices
to
be
installed
here,
or
is
it
just
some
minimum
program
we're
dealing
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
somehow
had
the
impression
that
we
were
dealing
here
with
a
crossing
that
had
crossbucks
installed
under
the
minimum
program
for
a
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case,
tennessee.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
the
secretary
has
exercised
it
just
by
providing
the
funds,
whether
or
not
any
particular
review
is
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
coleman,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
something
contrary
to
what
mr.
phillips
argued.
he
seemed
to
be
saying
the
federal
government
does
make
these
determinations,
and
you
seem
to
be
saying
they
just
make
a
blanket
determination
and
we
don't
want
them
to
make
individual
determinations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
does
the
scheme
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
wouldn't
prevent
the
state,
would
it,
from
coming
back
later
and
saying
this
crossing
deserves
a
better
mechanism
and
we're
going
to
use
some
of
the
federal
money,
or
at
least
propose
to
use
it,
to
upgrade?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
could
be
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
we
find
what
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
october
1993
the
respondent’s
husband
was
killed
at
a
railroad
grade
crossing
in
western
tennessee,
when
his
vehicle
was
struck
by
a
train
operated
by
the
petitioner
railway
company.
the
respondent
filed
suit
claiming
among
other
things
that
the
petitioner
was
negligent
for
failing
to
maintain
adequate
warning
devices
at
the
crossing.
the
warning
signs
at
the
crossing
had
been
installed
by
the
state
of
tennessee
with
funding
from
the
federal
highway
administration.
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
claim
was
preempted
by
the
federal
railroad
safety
act.
the
district
court
held
that
the
respondent’s
inadequate
warning
device
claim
was
not
preempted,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
the
safety
act
state
law
is
preempted,
if
the
secretary
of
transportation
prescribes
a
regulation
covering
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
requirement.
in
a
case
called
csx
transportation
versis
easterwood,
this
court
held
that
the
secretary’s
regulation
governing
the
adequacy
of
warning
devices
installed
at
railroad
crossings
with
the
participation
of
federal
funds,
preempts
state
tort
law
when
applicable.
the
question
here
is
whether
this
regulation
is
applicable
whenever
the
state
installs
warning
devices
using
federal
funds.
we
hold
that
it
is.
our
decision
in
the
earlier
easterwood
case
makes
clear
that
the
requirements
spelled
out
in
the
regulation
are
mandatory
for
all
devices
installed
with
federal
funds,
and
those
provisions
establish
a
federal
standard
for
adequacy
that
prescribes
the
warning
devices
that
have
to
be
installed
when
federal
funds
are
used.
once
the
federal
government
has
approved
and
funded
the
crossing
improvement
project
and
the
devices
have
been
installed,
state
law
governing
the
adequacy
of
those
devices
is
displaced.
this
is
precisely
the
interpretation
that
the
government
urged
us
to
adopt
in
the
easterwood
case.
the
government’s
argument
here
that
preemption
does
not
occur
until
there
has
been
an
individualized
engineering
assessment
of
the
crossing
is
not
entitled
to
deference,
as
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
regulation
and
contradicts
the
government’s
position
in
easterwood,
which
we
adopted
as
authoritative.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
