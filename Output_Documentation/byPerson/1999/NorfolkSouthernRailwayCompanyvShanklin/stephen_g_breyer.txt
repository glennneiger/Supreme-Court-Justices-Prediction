justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
on
this,
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
regulation,
(b)(4).
i
take
it
that
the
problem
has
arisen
because
most
of
the
time
you're
telling
me
everywhere
but
tennessee.
most
of
the
time
that
the
secretary
gives
money,
or
at
least
a
lot
of
the
time,
they'll
use
it
to
make
signs,
or
they'll
use
it
to
make
bells,
or
they
use
it
to
make
gates
or
tunnels
or
something,
and
normally
somebody
in
authority,
whether
it's
federal
or
state,
considers
that
to
be
adequate.
but
sometimes
money
is
taken
where
we're
just
going
to
do
this
quickly,
a
quick
sign,
and
we're
not
saying
it's
adequate,
we're
saying
it's
minimum,
and
here
it's
tennessee
that
says
that,
and
maybe
they're
the
only
ones
ever
to
say
it.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
have
i
got
it
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
maybe
nobody
else
ever
does,
but
our
problem
is,
it
makes
tremendous
sense
to
preempt
something,
where
somebody
in
authority
has
said
this
is
adequate,
so
keep
the
private
plaintiffs
out
of
it.
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
very
much
sense
to
do
it
when
they're
just
saying
it's
minimum,
but
you're
telling
me
that
the
regs
say
that,
so
that's
what
it
is.
but
as
i
look
at
the
reg,
the
key
reg
would
have
to
be
(4)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--(b)(4).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(b)(3)
doesn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
talks
about
whether
the
determination
is
made
by
state
regulatory
agencies,
state
highway,
et
cetera.
well,
why
couldn't
you
say,
the
word
determination
there
means
the
determination
that
this
is
adequate,
as
well
as
what
it
is,
and
so
the
reg,
(b)(4),
can...
because
you
don't
need
that
clause
set
off
in
commas,
you
know.
it
can
refer
to
giving
the
money,
and
obviously,
if
there's
some
determination
that
it's
adequate,
then
you
read
it
as
preemptive,
but
if
nobody's
ever
made
a
determination
that
it's
adequate,
it
just
doesn't
preempt,
or
it
doesn't
apply.
it's
talking
about
adequacy
determinations.
it's
talking
about
applying
where
there...
could
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this,
i
don't
understand
about
how
it
works.
suppose
that
tennessee
takes
[$]
43,
[$]
43,000,
and
it
says,
with
this
[$]
43,000
we
are
going
to
make
two
signs
at
two
crossings,
and
we
tell
you,
this
may
not
be
enough,
absolutely
may
not
be
enough,
and
they
have
to
get
the
secretary's
approval.
now,
is
the
secretary
forbidden
to
approve
it
unless
tennessee
says
it's
not
adequate?
tennessee
said
it's
not.
we
don't
know
if
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
a
109
argument,
but
if
i
don't
read
109
the
way
you
read
it,
why
don't
i
read
the
reg
to
say,
where
there's
an
adequacy
determination
by
somebody
in
authority,
you
win?
where
there's
no
adequacy
determination,
10...
the
(b)(4)
does
not
bar
anything.
could
i
read
it
that
way?
that's
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
number
8,617
on
the
list?
you
say,
gee,
that's
a
concern,
because
you
know,
if
you
really
look
at
it,
it's
not
a
great
crossing,
and
people
have
been
hurt
there,
and
somebody
would
like
to
sue
the
railroad
because
they
think
the
railroad
should
have
done
a
better
job
itself,
and
why
should
the
fact
that
you
happen
to
put
a
crossbucks
up
when
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
say,
that's
woefully
inadequate,
stop
the
plaintiff
from
suing
just
because
maybe
15
years
from
now
you're
going
to
get
around
to
number
8,617?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right,
but
i
mean,
you
haven't
relieved
the
concern
by
saying
that
that
is
what's
there.
i
mean,
i'd
be
worried
about
it,
and
that's
my
basic
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
doing
a
great
job.
the
concern
is,
there's
a
limited
amount
of
money,
and
number
8,617
on
the
list,
woefully
inadequate
though
it
is,
could
be
the
railroad's
fault
for
its
woeful
inadequacy,
and
that's
what
this
plaintiff
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
there's
no
bad
crossing
way
down
on
that
list
that
the
railroad's
never
in
fault?
how
would
we
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
just
said,
where
nobody
has
said
it's
adequate,
under
those
circum...
nobody
in
authority
has
said
it's
adequate.
under
those
circumstances,
no
preemption.
would
that
meet
your
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
representing
the
solicitor
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
they
go
into
some
length
saying,
of
course
we
could
even
decide
if
(b)(3)
exists.
we
have
loads
of
material.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
all
the
statistics.
what
do
you
mean,
you
have
to
go
out
and
look?
we
have
pictures
of
it
in
our
office.
i
mean,
what's
to
look.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
bothering
me
about
your
side
of
this
is
i
suspect
justice
scalia
was
right,
and
you
seem
to
agree
with
that,
too,
that
it's
pretty
hard
to
read
the
reg
(b)(4)
as
talking
about...
the
way
i
wanted
to
read
it,
i
think
that's
not
really
possible,
so
you
just
say,
well,
look,
(b)(4)
doesn't
apply
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nor
does
(b)(3).
and
what
they
come
back
and
say,
this
is
really
amazing,
here's
a
new
program
of
the
department
of
transportation
we've
never
even
heard
about,
but
we're
in
the
railroad
business.
there
seems,
according
to
the
sg
and
you,
to
be
a
program
of
handing
out
money
to
do
this
provisional
thing.
well,
that's
fine.
have
such
a
program,
but...
and
write
some
regs
for
it,
and
don't
say
they
don't
preempt,
but
we've
never
heard
of
it
up
till
now,
so
don't
just
bring
it
up
for
this
case.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
roughly...
perhaps
a
little
unfairly,
but
i
think
roughly
that's
what
their
case
is...
what
they're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
are
there
some
regs
on
this
other
program,
for
example?
where
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
get
that
point,
but
does
it
say
somewhere
that
(b)(4)
doesn't
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
(b)(3).
(b)(3)
we're
not
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
somewhere
(b)(4)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it,
then...
if
(b)(4)
doesn't
apply
to
this
minimal
program,
what
requires
the
secretary's
approval
for
the
minimal
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
something
in
some
other
regulation
that
says,
for
the
minimal
program
you
have
to
get
the
secretary's
approval
to
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
says
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
regulation
that
says
it
for
this
other...
well,
maybe
we'll...
i'll
look
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
for
45
years
we
thought
it
governed
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
they're
saying
for
25
years
we
thought
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
governed
this
minimal...
we're
not
saying
there
wasn't
some
minimal
thing.
maybe
there
was
a
minimal
program.
but
we
thought
it
was
governed,
just
like
the
whole
rest
of
the
program,
by
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
so
was
there
anything
that
made...
you
know,
that
says
that
wasn't
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
say
sometimes
you
do,
sometimes
you
don't.
why
do
you
have
to
send
out
a
diagnostic
team
in
nevada
to
see
if
it's
clear,
for
example,
if
there's
45
miles
of
track
without
a
curve,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
highway,
and
there's
no
mountain.
it's
a
desert.
i
mean,
why
would
you
have
to
send
out
a
team
to
show
that
there's
nothing
obstructing
the
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
need
the
secretary's
approval--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
minimal
program
expenditure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
says
that?
