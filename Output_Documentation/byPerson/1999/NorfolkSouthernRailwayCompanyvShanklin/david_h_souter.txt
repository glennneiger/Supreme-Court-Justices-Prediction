--wait,
are
you--
justice
david
h.

ms.
millett--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
ms.
millett--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i...
finish
your
sentence.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
the
problem
that
i
have
in
drawing
the
distinction
that
you're
drawing
is
this,
and
it's
essentially
the
same
problem
that
i
have
with
your
argument
from
25
years
of
administrative
experience.
in
easterwood,
which
was
what,
7
or
8
years
ago,
this
court
laid
down...
wisely
or
unwisely
it
laid
down
a
preemption
rule,
and
the
preemption
rule
turned
on
the
participation
of
federal
funds,
and
the
formulation
that
the
court
used,
if
i
remember
correctly,
was
just
about
exactly
what
the
solicitor
general
at
the
time
said
was
the
formulation
we
ought
to
use.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
that
point
the
federal
highway
administration
had
some
kind
of
an
obligation
to
say,
if
the
court
means
what
it
says
in
adopting
the
language
which
we
told
it
to
adopt,
there's
no
longer
a
distinction
between
minimum
programs
under
(d),
whatever
it
is
(d),
and
the
subsection
(3)
and
subsection
(4)
programs.
the
court
has
laid
down
a
clear
rule,
and
it
turns
on
whether
federal
money
is
involved.
therefore,
we
better
do
one
of
several
things.
we
better
revise
our
regs.
maybe
we
better
get
statutory
authority.
maybe
we
better
send
more
people
out
to
look
at
the
intersections.
but
the
truth
is,
there
has
been
a
simple
rule,
announced
by
this
court
for
7
or
8
years
ago,
and
i
don't
know
why
that
does
not
trump
the
administrative
experience
that
you
refer
to
that
preceded
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no
question
that
when
the
minimal
sawbuck
signs
are
installed
the
purpose
of
installing
them
is
to
make
the
crossing
safe.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
not
succeed,
but
that's
the
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
that's
what
i
meant.
it
may
not
succeed
in
its
objective,
but
its
objective
is
clear,
and
that's
why
the
money
is
being
spent.
