well,
it's
a
different
solicitor
general,
too,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
a
different
solicitor
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
representing
a
different
philosophy
on
this
whole
area
of
the
law,
i
would
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
may
i
ask
just
sort
of
a
basic
question?
normally
when
we
have
sort
of
a
preemption
here
the
railroads
contribute
something.
they
pay
a
lot
of
money
to
do
something,
and
in
exchange
they
get
the
exemption
from
tort
liability,
but
here
it's
rather
odd,
because
as
i
understand
from
your
brief
the
incentive
to
put
in
the
safety
devices
for
the
railroads
isn't...
is
not...
tort
liability
doesn't
provide
a
sufficient
incentive,
because
the
cost
of
installation
exceeds
their
potential
liability.
you
say
that
in
your
brief.
and
here
it's
rather
unusual
because
the
government
provides
the
money
and
with
it
provides
total
preemption
and
protection
for
the
railroads,
and
the
railroads
get
two
benefits
at
no
cost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
puzzled
about
one
thing.
how
does
the
outcome
of
this
case
bear
on
your
ability
to
carry
out
your
own
program?
does
it
matter
which
way
we
decide
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
federal-state
without
requiring
any
contribution
from
the
railroads.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
that
happen
no
matter
which
way
we
decided
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
will
divert
the
railroad's
resources.
it
won't
divert
your
resources.
