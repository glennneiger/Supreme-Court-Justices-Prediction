mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
7
years
ago
in
csx
v.
easterwood
this
court
held
that
when
the
provisions
of
23
c.f.r.
646.213(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
which
from
now
on
i
am
going
to
refer
to
as
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
because
otherwise
i
won't
get
any
of
my
argument
out,
quote,
are
applicable,
state
tort
law
is
preempted.
specifically,
the
court
identified
the
sine
qua
non
of
preemption
as
whether,
quote,
federal
funds
participate
in
the
installation
of
warning
devices
at
the
particular
site.
preemption,
the
court
held,
was
appropriate
in
that
context
because
the
determination
of
what
type
of
warning
device
to
be
installed
at
a
particular
crossing
is
in
those
circumstances,
quote,
subject
to
the
secretary's
approval.
the
court
expressly
recognized
that
under
that
particular
regulatory
scheme
the
secretary
has
decided
the
means
by
which
railroads
are
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
a
particular
device
and
thus,
when
applicable,
the
secretary's
regulations
cover
the
subject
matter
of
tort
law
regarding
the
adequacy
of
the
particular
devices
within
the
meaning--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
is
not
a
minimum
program,
justice
o'connor.
all
of...
the
program
is
the
program.
(b)(3)
refers
specifically
to
any
project,
which
means
that
if
federal
funds
are
involved
it
is
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
on
the
same
standards
as
any
other
project
that
happens
to
be
submitted
for
the
secretary's
approval,
and
on
the
same
standards.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
absolutely
wrong,
justice
o'connor,
on
two
counts,
one
a
matter
of
law,
and
one
is
a
matter
of
fact.
the
legal
problem
with
the
argument
is,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
minimum
protection
program
that
is
distinct
under
(b)(1)
from
the
projects,
from
the
any
projects
that
are
referenced
in
(b)(3).
(b)(3)
specifically
has
the
heading,
adequate
warning
devices,
and
it
is
designed
to
ensure
that
all
projects
that
receive
federal
funds
are
in
fact
approved,
and
that
the
secretary
has
at
least
available
the
option
to
say
no,
additional
safety
is
required
in
a
particular
circumstance.
the
fact
that
the
secretary
doesn't
do
that
routinely
is
simply
a
reflection
of
the
respect
that
the
secretary
has
in
the
way
the
states
operate--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
section
130
program.
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
pages
46a
and
47a.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
think
both
of
those
are
probably
required
in
any
given
circumstance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
at
that
point,
preemption
occurs,
and
at
that
point
as
well,
of
course,
that
particular
crossing
we
now
know
is
part
of
this
global
130
program
that
is
designed
to
systematically,
comprehensively
collect
data,
analyze
each
of
the
crossings
throughout
the
state,
and
make
a
determination
on
a
regular
basis
as
to
whether
or
not
those
crossings
are
adequate
on
a
going-forward
basis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
ginsburg.
what
was
actually
involved
there,
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
any
protections
at
the
cartersville--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--crossing
in
csx.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--okay.
again,
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
funding
of
a
sign.
what
actually
happened
in
tennessee...
tennessee
has
a
program,
a
quote,
minimum
program
that
is
tennessee-specific,
that
is
different,
that
is
unique
to
tennessee.
every
other
state
basically
has
a
project,
but
tennessee
decided
to
upgrade
over
what
is
required
specifically
under
section
130.
section
130
says,
yeah,
everybody
should
have
a
sign
at
a
crossing.
tennessee
went
beyond
that
and
said,
you
have
to
have
reflectorized
crossbucks,
and
you
have
to
have
a
warning
sign
at
every
crossing.
that
is
above
and
beyond
the
federal
minimum,
and
that
is
exactly
what
was
placed
on
all
of
the
projects
that
were
involved
in
the
1987
federal
funding.
that's
the
scheme
in
place
here.
now,
that's
the
factual
distinction
which
says,
this
is
not...
even
if
you
want
to
work
off
of
a
notion
that
there's
a
minimum
sign
program,
which
i
don't
think
is
incorporated
into
this
regulatory
scheme,
it
wouldn't
apply
here.
but
the
more...
but
over
and
above
that,
it's
clear
that
this
regulatory
scheme
envisions
that
the
secretary
will
pay
money
and
then
be
responsible,
along
with
the
state
on
a
prospective
basis
for
ensuring
the
safety
and
the
protection
of
the
citizens
who
have
to
make...
who
have
to
go
across
those
particular
crossings,
and
the
court
understood
that
when
it
set
out
the
legal
framework
to
be
applied
in
this
particular
context.
to
be
sure,
the
court
held
there
was
no
federal
funding
at
that
particular
site.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
wouldn't
be
so
bold
as
to
tell
you
that
there's
no
basis
for
rethinking
the
wisdom
of
the
basic
analysis
in
easterwood,
but
the
reality
of
what
happened
in
easterwood
is,
the
solicitor
general
described
this
exact
scheme
and
said
that
this
is
a...
that
this
prospective
approach
will
work
perfectly
well,
it
is
exactly
what
congress
wanted,
but
the
key
is
to
make
sure
that
each
individual
grade
crossing
is
embraced
by
this
scheme,
and
you
can
only
be
assured
of
that
once
you
have
federal
funding,
or
that
federal
moneys
participate
in
the
installation
of
the
devices
for
any
project
under
(b)(3).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
the
secretary
spends
the
money
under
the
program
that's
set
up
today,
under
the
(b)(3),
(b)(4)
program
that
exists
today,
then
the
secretary
would
necessarily
have
to
review
the
moneys
that
are
being
spent
and
ensure
that
those
projects
are
being
done
in
a
safe
fashion,
and
then
rely
on
the
states,
subject
to
federal
approval
as
well,
because
it's
all
federally
funded,
to
ensure
the
future
safety
of
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
answer
to
that
problem
would
be
that
the
secretary
ought
to
change
the
regulations
so
that
they
no
longer
define
adequate
warning
devices
at
all
projects
for
which
federal
funds
are
involved.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
they
want
to
get
out
of
that
they
could
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
the
way
this
is
set
up
at
this
point,
it
specifically
says
any
project,
and
i
think
that
language
necessarily
means
that
if
you're
allowing
federal
funds
to
participate,
regardless
of
how
you
do
it,
you
preempt
state
law.
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this,
though,
and
it's
the
reason
why
easterwood
is
a
sensible
approach
to
this
problem,
is,
it
doesn't
mean
that
people
are
left
unprotected.
that's
the
suggestion
made
by
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
point
here
is
that
the
states
have
a
continuous
obligation,
and
the
railroads
have
a
continuous
obligation
to
update
information
about
each
one
of
these
grade
crossings,
the
information
that
they
have
available.
how
many
trains
are
running?
what
kinds
of
materials
are
running
on
those
trains?
what
kinds...
and
from
the
states.
what's
running
on
that
road?
is
there
going
to
be
a
high
school
built
next
door,
et
cetera,
all
of
which
goes
into
a
yearly
report
to
determine
whether
or
not
each
of
those
grade
crossings
is
safe.
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he
did
not
support
the...
oh,
he
supported
the
outcome--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
you
reached
in
easterwood,
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
not
only
supported
the
rationale,
he...
i
was
going
to
say
invented.
that's
probably
harsh.
he
came
up
with
the
rationale,
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
his
analysis
of
this
regulatory
scheme
that
suggested
that
ultimately
the
linchpin
to
preemption
ought
to
be
federal
funding,
because
in
that
way
you
guarantee
that
each
project
has
had
an
initial
look,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
transportation,
and
then
you
get
the
benefit
of
the
entire--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
the
solicitor
general
could
fairly
be
described
as
having
come
up
the
hill
to
ask
you
to
come
back
down
the
hill--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--my...
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
different
solicitor
general.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
no
question
about
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that...
and
the
reason
for
that...
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though
this
is...
i
mean,
the
reason
why
there's
no
cost
to
the
railroads
is
that
there's
no
real
benefit
to
the
railroad
because
first
of
all,
you
know,
having
grade
crossings
does
no
benefit
to
the
railroad.
if
the
railroad
had
its
choice,
it
would
close
those
roads
so
they
don't
go
across
the
railroad,
so
that
part
of
it,
allowing
them
to
keep
going
across
doesn't
provide
any
benefit.
the
safety
that
you're
trying
to
provide...
and
that's
why
the
federal
government
doesn't
require,
and
expressly
limits
the
amount
the
railroads
can
be
made
to
pay
for
these
particular
projects,
because
they
recognize
the
beneficiary
of
this
particular
program
are
the
people,
are
the
users
of
the
highway,
not
the
users
of
the
railroad.
but
the
reason
why
it
ends
up
with
the
particular
situation
you've
described,
justice
stevens,
is
the
nature
of
the
relatively
unique
statutory
preemption
under
201.06
in
title
49.
there,
congress
made
it
clear
that
when
the
secretary
has
adopted
a
requirement,
then
that
preempts
state
law,
and
all
that
the
solicitor
general's
position
and
the
court
held
in
csx
was
that
in
this
particular
context,
with
the
funding
that
we've
made,
it
was
subject
to
the
approval,
that
creates
a
requirement
that
triggers
covering
the
subject
matter
under
the
preemption
provision,
which
is
how
you
end
up
there.
i
think
in
that...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
tennessee
said
they
wanted
to
have
a
minimum
protection
program--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--(b)(4)--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
breyer,
the
next
line
where
you
stop
the
quotation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--says,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
federal
highway
administration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
the
initial
determination
of
adequacy
is
made
by
those
who
are
the
closest
to
the
situation,
and
they
cover
essentially
the
scope
of
individuals
who
would
have
information
relevant
to
make
the
determination
as
to
the
adequacy
of
these
particular
devices,
but
all
of
that
remains
subject,
ultimately,
to
the
secretary's
approval,
and
if
the
secretary's
not
convinced
that
these
are
adequate,
and
essentially
that
has
to
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
what
is
clear
is
that
the
secretary
is
supposed
to
exercise
discretion,
particularly
with
respect
to
all
109,
section
109--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
that
would
be...
the
scheme
was
designed
to
be
comprehensive
and,
indeed,
i
don't
read
the...
i
don't
read
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
scalia,
the
entire
regulatory
scheme
is
the
(b)(3),
(b)(4)
scheme,
and
look
at
the
beginning
of
(b)(3).
it
says,
adequate
warning
devices.
this
is
an
entire
effort...
and
the
court
recognized
this
in
csx.
this
is
an
entire
effort
to
make
sense
out
of
a
grade
crossing
situation
that
was
a
mish-mash
of
state
and
federal
law,
and
to
provide
a
comprehensive
solution
to
it
which
requires
that
the
secretary
have
ultimate
control
both
in
terms
of
making
safety
determinations,
which
comes
out
of
109,
and
this
is
an
implementation
of
109.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
that...
to
me
that's
the
pivotal
point,
though,
is
the
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary.
it
means
it's
also
subject
to
the
disapproval
of
the
secretary
on
the
basis
that
this
is
not
adequate
for
the
particular
circumstance.
the
fact
that
the
states
do
an
outstanding
job
and
therefore
don't
implicate
this
problem
doesn't
mean
that
the
secretary
doesn't
necessarily
have
that
authority
and,
frankly,
the
fact
that
texas
is
here
defending
the
state's
job
i
think
speaks
volumes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
secretary
receives
whatever
information
the
secretary
wants
on
a
project-by-project
basis
if
that's
what
he
requires,
and
then
has
to
sign...
one
of
his
delegees
has
to
sign
off
on
it,
so
yes,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
under
those
circumstances.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
obviously
concerned
that
the
court
may
actually
conclude
that
what
it
said
is
what
it
meant
in
easterwood,
the
government
and
the
respondents
have
asked
you
to
create
an
entirely
different
regulatory
scheme,
and
that
is
a
scheme
that
no
one
has
ever
seen
or
identified.
there
is
no
regulatory
footprints.
there
are
no
regulatory
fingerprints
that
even
remotely
suggest
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
minimum
safety
program
and
the
(b)(3)(b)(4)
adequate
warning
program
which
is
the
basis
on
which
this
court
decided
preemption
would
turn
in
easterwood.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
130(d),
which
is
the
basis
for
the
minimum
safety
program
the
government
identifies,
and
recognize
that
the
language
of
130(d),
which
is
at
42a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
at
a
minimum
such
a
schedule...
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
sites
or
anything.
the
schedule
has
to
provide
for
that,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
this
is
not
a
provision
that
creates
an
entirely
new
regulatory
scheme.
if
the
secretary
had
wanted
to
do
so,
it
certainly
would
have
been
within
the
secretary's
discretion.
that's
not
the
regulatory
scheme
that
the
secretary
adopted.
the
one
the
secretary
adopted
is
the
one
the
court
identified
in
easterwood,
and
if
it
simply
applies
the
language
of
easterwood
to
this
case,
the
outcome
of
this
case
seems
to
me
to
be
foreordained.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
there's
clearly
statutory
authority,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
are
designed
to
implement
109,
which
is
what's
going
to
preserve
the
government's
ability
to
decide
what
safe,
and
what
it's
going
to
fund,
and
if
the
secretary
chooses
to
apply
that
in
a
different
way,
that's
fine,
but
that's
not
the
system
that
the
secretary
employed
in
this
particular
case,
and
it's
not
the
system
the
court
identified
in
easterwood.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
109...
well,
first
of
all,
there's
a
serious
question
about
whether
they
intend
that,
but
the
bottom
line
about
109
is,
the
regulation
still
implements
109.
adequate
is
adequate
for
both
