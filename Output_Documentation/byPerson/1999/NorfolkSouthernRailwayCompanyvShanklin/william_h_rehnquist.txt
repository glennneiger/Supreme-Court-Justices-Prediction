well,
mr.

from

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goldstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
would
want
to
decide
this
case
just
on
the
basis
of
what
an
official
said
about
this
particular
crossing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
its
section
109.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
section
also
says
not
just
federal
aid
highway,
or
highway
affected
under
chapter
2
of
this
title.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
the
section
you
just
referred
to,
the
quoted
section
on
page...
is
the
one
that
authorizes
the
federal
government
to
contribute
funds
even
where
the
situation
is
inadequate.
i
don't
see
that
in
the
language
that
you
refer
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
goldstein,
the
section
you
just
read,
which
in
your
brief
you
say
the
federal
highway
administration
explained
in
1974,
and
then
it's
cited
fhmp.
was
this
a
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary?
what
sort
of
a
thing
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
that
certainly
doesn't
have
nearly
the
status
that
a
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
could
something
that
was
issued
in
1974
explain
what
happened
in
the
eighties
or
nineties?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
just
a
minute,
mr.
goldstein.
you
said,
as
i
understood
it,
that
this
thing
that
you
quoted
here
explained
what
happened
in
the
eighties
and
nineties,
and
i
said
how
could
it,
when
it
was
issued
in
1974.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
page
are
you
reading?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
distinguish
between
making
a
crossing
safe
and
making
it
less
unsafe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.

opinion
of
the
court

no.
