justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how...
how
do
you
distinguish...
what
is
magical
about
documents?
let's...
let's
use
a
gun.
suppose...
suppose
there's
a
murder.
you...
you
have
the
bullet
that
caused
the
death,
and
you...
you
also
know
that
the
defendant
has
purchased
a
gun
of
the
same
caliber.
you
serve
a
subpoena
on
the
defendant
saying,
turn
over
this
gun
which...
which
you...
you
are
shown...
we
know
you
own
it.
are
you
entitled
to
get
that
gun?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
you
get
the
gun.
you
do
a
ballistics
test
on
it.
you
find
that
that
is,
indeed,
the
bullet
that...
that
caused
the
murder,
and...
and
this
has--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
been
compelled
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
registered.
he
bought
it
from
a...
you
know,
in
a
state
where
all
handguns
purchases
have
to
be
registered.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
accepting
my
gun
hypothetical,
and
you
say
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
demand
of
the
defendant,
who
has
squirreled
away
the
gun...
he's
actually
the
murderer.
he's
hidden
the
gun
somewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
can
come
to
him
and
say,
turn
over
the
gun
with
which
you
committed
the
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
don't
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--turn
over
the
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
all
guns.
just...
just
this
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
the.38
caliber
automatic
that
you
are
shown
to
have
purchased.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
make
him
tell
you
where
the
gun
is.
you
can
only
make
him
go
get
the
gun
and
give
it
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you...
you
think
that...
that
is
a
sensible
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i...
i
gather
that
means
that
your
answer
to
my
hypothetical
earlier
would
be
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem
in
requiring
a
person
to
turn
over
the
handgun
which...
which
was
used
in
the
commission
of
a
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
only
thing
the
government
can't
use
is
the
fact
that
he
turned
it
over
to
prove
that
he
possessed
it.
the
government
could
come
in
and
show
the
record
that
he
purchased
it
and...
and
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
surmise
that
he
still
continued
to
have
it
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government
could
show
at
the
trial
that
the
murder
was
committed
with
a
handgun
that
had
been
purchased
by
mr.
x.--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
handwriting--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
in...
in
the
gun
case,
you
really
think
the
gun
case
comes
out
differently
if,
you
know,
the...
the
suspected
murderer
has
shown
the
gun
to
somebody
and
then
he
runs
off
to
a
cabin
in
the
woods?
he
has
been
surrounded
ever
since
there...
then.
you
know
that
the
gun
exists.
you
know
that
he
has
it
somewhere
in
the
cabin
in
the
woods.
he
could
have
buried
it
somewhere.
search
and
seizure.
you're
never
going
to
dig
it
up.
in
that
case,
since
it's
a
foregone
conclusion,
you
can
require
him
to
turn
over
the
gun?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
have
some
doubts
about
the
foregone
conclusion
qualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
an
admission
qualification
rather
than--
