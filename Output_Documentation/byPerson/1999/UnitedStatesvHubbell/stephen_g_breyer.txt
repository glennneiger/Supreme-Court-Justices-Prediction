justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there's
a
big
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
we
go
to
the
other
part
of
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical?
i
understand
and
will
assume
you're
right
on
two
things.
i
assume
that
the
problem
of
knowing
that
these...
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
person
has
material
like
this
is
a
kind
of
fourth
amendment
problem
that
may
be
in
rule
17
and
some
cases
of
the
court,
but
don't
concern
us
here.
i
put
it
to
the
side.
i'm
also
putting
to
the
side
and
assuming
you're
absolutely
right
that
you
can
get
the
single
gun
that
you
know
exists
and
just
give
him
the
production
immunity.
but
there's
a
second
assertion
here.
one
is
the
assertion
i
have
the
thing.
okay?
we
give
him
use
immunity
for
that.
the
other
is
the
assertion
the
thing
exists.
now,
in
respect
to
that
statement,
the
thing
exists,
it
creates
a
problem
only
where
you
are
subpoenaing
hundreds
of
things
because
if
you
ask
for
a
year's
worth
of
tax
checks,
it's
certainly
very
possible
that
four
of
those
checks,
unbeknownst
to
you,
turn
out
to
be
pure
gold.
that's
why
they
have
a
subpoena,
and
you
didn't
know
before
he
brought
these
into
the
room
that
those
four
checks
existed.
all
you
asked
for
were
all
his
tax
records.
now,
every
case
that
we've
had,
including
doe
i,
which
is
what
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
suggests
that
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem
in
that
statement,
the
thing
exists.
and
where
the
government
doesn't
independently
know
that
the
thing
exists,
they
are
using
the
testimonial
response
to
the
question,
does
that
thing
exist.
now,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
problem
that
the
second
circuit,
this
circuit,
that
doe
i,
that
our
fisher
use
of
the
word
existence,
et
cetera
is...
is
focusing
on.
and
i'd
like
you
to
focus
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
in
any
case
where
it's
not
a
foregone
conclusion,
that
this
particular
document...
i
mean,
why
stop
there?
that
the
words
on
this
particular
document
are
precisely
what
they
are.
in
any
case
where
it
isn't
a
foregone
conclusion...
i.e.,
where
the
prosecutor
doesn't
already
know...
on
the
line
that
is
being
taken
with
this
word
existence,
it
becomes
testimonial
and
the...
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
applies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then
we're
back
overruling
fisher--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--back
to
boyd,
and
not
only
boyd,
well
beyond
boyd
because
exactly...
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it's
exactly
the
same
thing
whether
it's
a
document
or
not.
it's
exactly
the
same
thing
with
any
piece
of
evidence
whatsoever.
the
only
time
that
you
would
be
able
to
compel
a
person
to
produce
that
evidence
in
court
is
when
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
already
has
precisely
that
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
very
far-reaching
and...
and
seems...
is
there
a...
i
mean,
suppose
the
court
decides
we're
not
going
to
overrule
fisher.
i
agree
that
the
logic
of
it
is
right
in
that
word
existence
in
fisher,
but
you
can't
sort
of
assume
fisher
intends
to
blow
itself
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good,
but
we're
on
exactly
the
same
track.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i'm
searching
for
and
have
been
unable
to
find...
we're
absolutely
eye
to
eye
as
far
as
the
logic
is
concerned.
and
i'm
searching.
is
there
some
kind
of
test
in
respect
to
existence
that
isn't
as
weak
as
the
possible...
reasonable
possibility
test
which
may
be
a
rule
17
or
fourth
amendment
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
something
like
that,
but
isn't
as
strong
as
foregone
conclusion
and
gives
some
meaning
to
these
cases?
that's
what
she's...
that's
what
they're
driving
at
by
reasonable
particularity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
but
that's
a
sort
of
illogical
compromise.
i
mean,
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
couldn't
require
a
handwriting
example,
i
guess,
could
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
i
mean...
no.
but
you're
pushing
the
logic
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
really
your
truth-telling
test
is
simply
the
obverse
side
of
the
foregone
conclusion
coin.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
they're
both
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
so,
is
there
any
fall-back
position?
that
is
to
say,
you...
you
pushed
the
logic
for
what
it's
worth.
i...
i
see
that.
and
is
there
any
position
that
would
reconcile
these
cases?
like
i'm
almost
tempted
to
say
you
couldn't
force
people
into
lineups
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you...
maybe
you
could
force
them
into
lineups.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
lineups
might
be...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could...
could...
suppose
you
were
to
say
hypothetically,
i
see
the
logic,
i
see
it's
there
in
the
cases,
i
see
it's
there
in
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
still,
wouldn't
it
work
a
revolution
in
what
prosecutors
and
defense
lawyers
alike
have
come
to
expect
that
the
fifth
amendment
stands
for?
and
revolutions
don't
take
place
ordinarily
in
the
law
even
if
the...
without
them
it's
a
little
illogical,
at
least...
et
cetera.
could
you
expand
a
little
on
that
theme?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that.
now,
apply
that
to
outside
the
business
record
context,
and
is
there
a
revolution
there?
i
mean,
after
all,
the
same
principle
will
apply
whether
it's
a
business
record
or
any
other
kind
of
evidence
that
the...
the
person
asserting
the
amendment
has
in
his
possession.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
booty
from
hijacking
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can
do
that.
i
mean,
if
they
want
to
give
him
that
immunity,
they
will.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
just
in
answering
it,
why
not?
