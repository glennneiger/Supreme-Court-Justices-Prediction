mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
properly
assess
the
effect
of
a
grant
of
use
immunity
in
a
documentary
subpoena
context,
it's
necessary
to
separate
out
the
two
components
of
what
is
compelled
by
the
subpoena.
first,
the
subpoena
compels
a
physical
act,
the
transfer
of
documents
from
the
witness
to
the
government.
second,
the
subpoena
also
compels
the
witness
to
make
certain
implicit
testimonial
admissions
about
that
the
responsive
documents
exist,
that
they
are
in
his
possession,
and
that
the
production
to
the
government
will
transfer
the
documents
to
the
government.
now,
the
witness
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
only
with
respect
to
the
testimonial
components
of
the
act
of
production,
not
with
respect
to
the
physical
act
itself
that
transfers
the
documents.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
there's
a
substantial
fifth
amendment
claim
that
the
witness
has,
that
possession
of
that
handgun
is
highly
incriminating,
and
as
a
result,
the
witness
can
assert
the
fifth
amendment
and
require
the
government
to
give
the
witness
act
of
production
immunity
if
the
government
wishes
to
enforce
the
subpoena.
the
question
then
becomes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
government
has
to
show
that
it
does
not
use
anything
testimonial
in
the
investigation
that
leads
up
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
need
to
do
at
least
that,
and
it
would
also
need
to
show
that
it
did
not
make
use,
as
an
investigatory
lead,
of
its
knowledge
that
this
witness
possessed
the
particular
item.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
think,
first
of
all,
the...
the
notion
that
the
subpoena
respondent
says,
the
thing
exists,
is
not
a
meaningful
statement
and
is
not
one
that
the
court's
cases
actually
contemplate
as
being
the
testimonial
statement.
i
realize
the
court
has
said
that,
but
the
only
meaningful
statement
that
a
respondent
can
make
is
that
responsive
documents
exist,
which
is
a
way
of
correlating
what
the
subpoena
calls
for
with
what
the
documents
actually
say.
and
the
government
may
not
use...
make
use
of
the
mental
act
that
the
witness
uses
to
correlate
documents
with
a
subpoena.
that
is
most
significant
and
most
important
when
the
document
itself
is,
for
example,
a
list
of
numbers
and
the
witness
produces
it
under
a
subpoena
specification
that
calls
for
give
me
all
itemizations
of
your
income.
in
such
a
case,
we
cannot
interpret
the
document
or
make
use
of
it
without
taking
advantage
of
the
witness'
mental
faculties.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't.
this
was
not
our
prosecution,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
justice
kennedy,
on
the
assumption
that
the...
the
actions
of
mr.
hubbell,
sitting
in
a
grand
jury,
do
not
change
the
essential
testimonial
representations
that
were
made.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
the
result
of
that
is
that
we
would
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
problem
exists
if
we
make
use
of
what
is
testimonial
and
what
the
witness
is
compelled
to
do.
if
we
do
not
make
use
of
what
is
testimony,
we
are
not
trenching
on
fifth
amendment
values.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
can
bring
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
with
less
than
probable
cause.
the
very
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
is
to
determine
whether
probable
cause
exists.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
essential
position
that
we
have
taken
responds
to
the
fact
that
in
fisher
and
in
doe
this
court
overruled
the
doctrine
of
boyd
under
which
the
notion
was
that
the
contents
of
the
documents
themselves
were
testimonial
and
that
a
witness
was
being
compelled
to
testify
by
producing
those
contents.
what
fisher
and
doe
require
the
court
to
do
is
separate
out
that
which
is
testimonial
in
an
act
of
production
from
that
which
is
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
argument
would
change
only
insofar
as
there
is
a
greater
chance
that
more
testimony
that
is
protected
would
go
before
the
grand
jury
and
potentially
influence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
relatively
unusual,
but
far
from
unheard
of.
and
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
it
is
not
done
is
that
under
our
view
of
the
law,
there
is
still
a
significant
kastigar
issue
that
the
government
has
to
get
over.
if
we
show
that
we
made
no
use
whatsoever
of
any
of
the
act
of
production,
but
only
the
contents
of
the
records,
that's
fine.
but
it
may
be
difficult
to
show
that
if
the
witness
produces
records
that
take
on
their
meaning
only
from
being
correlated
with
the
subpoena
or
would
suggest
that
he
had
knowledge
of
their
contents.
the
witness--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
said
in
kastigar
and
also
in
united
states
v.
apfelbaum,
which
is
at
445
u.s.
115,
that
6002
was
intended
to
go
as
far
as
but
no
further
than
the
fifth
amendment.
what
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
language
i
think
was
written
against
a
backdrop
of
boyd
in
which
the
contents
of
the
records
were
protected,
and
so
if
the
witness
were
compelled
to
produce
private
papers
that
he
had
created,
that
created
a
fifth
amendment
issue.
but
the
intent
of
the
statute
and
this
court's
construction
of
it
has
been
to
make
it
coextensive
with
the
fifth
amendment.
