justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
did
you...
did
the
government
know
about
the
contents
of
the
documents
ahead
of
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
had...
you
had
no
idea
what...
what
you
were
going
to
find.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
was
only
by
virtue
of
the
production
of
the
documents
that
you
learned
the
facts
that
enabled
you
to
then
carry
out
a
prosecution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
have
to
show?
that
you
had
an
independent
source
of
the
information
or
what?
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
you
can
introduce
it
in
evidence
and
use
it
against
him
at
trial.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mann,
let...
let
me
ask
you
this
in
relation
to
the
gun.
if
you
were
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
go
out
and
search
the
residence
for
a
gun,
what
would
you
have
to
show
the
magistrate
to
get
that
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
reason
to
think
that
he
has
something
that
you
might
find
that's
relevant
to
the
crime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
you
have
to
show
more
or
less
to
issue
a
subpoena
to
say,
give
me
all
your
guns?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
i...
i
had
the...
have
been
making
the
assumption
that
the
government
makes
use
of
section
6002
immunity
provisions
to
compel
testimony
from
witnesses
largely
in
a
third
party
context,
in
other
words,
getting
evidence
that
way
from
a
third
party
to
use
against
another
criminal
defendant.
how
often
does
the
government
turn
around
and
prosecute
the
very
person
who
is
given
the
immunity
under
section
6002?
is
that
unusual
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and...
and
the
language
of
section
6002
itself
is
sort
of
broad:
no
other
information
compelled
under
the
order
or
information
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
it
may
be
used
against
the
witness.
i
mean,
that's
pretty
broad.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
that
language
goes
pretty
far,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
government
subpoenas
income
tax...
copies
of
income
tax
forms
and
records?
they
don't
ask
for
incriminating
anything.
give
me
your
income
tax
forms
and
records
for
years
5
and
6.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
most
people
it
is.
is
it
or
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
about
business
records,
mr.
nields?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
everyone
knows
that
a
business
or
a
law
firm
keeps
records.
it
keeps
records
of
who
the
clients
are
and
what
the
billings
were
and
what
was
paid.
it's
a
foregone
conclusion
that
they
do.
can
the
government
subpoena
those
business
records
and
fall
within
the
bounds
of
fisher?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
in
the
context
of
a
law
firm's
records
of
clients
and
billings
and
payments,
i
don't...
i
don't
see
that
that
necessarily
follows.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you're
saying
the
government
should
have
called
in
some
file
clerks
from
the
law
firm
and
gotten
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
government
have
enough
here
to
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but...
but
in...
in
the
first
doe
case,
it
was
business
records,
and
the
court
said,
fine,
you
can
compel
those
and
use
the
contents
against
the
producer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
went
on
to
say
the
contents
of
voluntarily
prepared
private
papers
enjoy
no
privilege.
