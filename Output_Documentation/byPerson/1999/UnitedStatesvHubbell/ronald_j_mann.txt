mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
about
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
context
of
the
compelled
production
of
documents.
specifically,
does
the
privilege
extend
not
only
to
the
compelled
testimonial
communications,
the
witness'
admissions
that
the
documents
exist,
that
they're
in
his
position...
possession
and
that
that
they
respond
to
the
subpoena,
but
also
to
other
voluntarily
recorded
information
that
is
contained
in
the
documents?
now,
it's
common
ground
that
the
contents
of
the
documents
were
not
privileged
before
the
compulsion.
although
they
would
have
been
privileged
under
boyd,
your
decision
in
fisher
rejected
that
view.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
then
is
whether
the
way
in
which
the
government
obtained
those
documents
through
a
compelled
act
of
production
taints
what
otherwise
would
not
be
privileged.
now,
respondent
gives
us
a
categorical
answer
that
in
any
compelled
testimonial
admission
of
existence
always
automatically
taints
the
contents
of
the
produced
documents.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
just
a
few
minutes.
and
the...
the
questions
that
were
asked
in
the
grand
jury
are
the
questions
that
we
ask
typically
pursuant
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual.
it's
basically
restating
the
things
that
are
the
implicit
testimonial
admissions
that
the
court
identified
in
fisher.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the
testimony
was...
was
for
just
a
few
minutes.
i
really
don't
know
how
long
he
was
actually,
you
know,
in
the
grand
jury.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
i
think
that
that's
true,
but
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case
and
i
think
in
most
cases
where
you
have
a
production
of
documents,
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
things
that
the
witness
is
forced
to
say,
implicitly
or
explicitly...
and
in
this
case,
i
think
those
things
were
much
the
same...
and
the
contents
of
the
documents.
and
in
this
case...
and
i
think
in
many
cases...
we
don't
have
to
use
and
we
didn't
use
in
any
way
any
of
the
things
that
he
said.
i
mean,
all
we're
using
is
the
information
that
was
in
the
documents.
i
think
the...
the
key
for
us
to
this
case
is
that
it's
not
relevant
that
we
got
the
documents
from
respondent.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no.
we
absolutely
did
not
know
about
the
contents
of
the
documents,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
no
idea
is
probably
something
of
a
stretch,
but
we
certainly
are
not
in
a
position
to
prove
that
we
knew
with
reasonable
particularity
what
the
documents
contained.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
that's
absolutely
right,
but
i
think
it's
important
to...
to
remember
that
it's
clear,
in
the
cases
that
the
court
has
had
since
kastigar,
in
fisher
and
in
the
other
cases
interpreting
the
statute,
that
it's
not
a
problem
for
the
government
to
show
that
we
would
not
have
the
incriminating
information
but
for
the
compelled
act
of
production.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
we
can
force
a
witness
to
speak--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
i
think...
i
think
analytically
that's
a
good
way
to
put
it.
kastigar,
of
course,
does
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
permits
the
government
to
use
things
it
gets
from
an
independent
source.
we
look
at
fisher
as
explaining
that
the
act
of
production
has
a
twofold
nature,
that
the
act
of
production
itself
is
physical,
non-testimonial
conduct.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
i
think
what
we
have
to--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
what
we...
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
anything
about
our
quantum
of
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
documents.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
think
we
have
to
show,
once...
under
kastigar,
once
a
defendant
shows
that
he's
been
compelled
to
testify,
the
burden
shifts
to
us
to
show
that
we
did
not
use
any
of
his
compelled
testimonial
communications.
and
in
this
context--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--oh,
well,
to
get
the
subpoena,
we
have
to
satisfy
the
regular
standard
under
r.
enterprises
and
then
the
regular
standard
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
show
that
we
have
a
basis
for
issuing
a
subpoena.
now,
that
standard
is...
is
not
difficult
for
grand
juries
to
satisfy.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no,
i...
i
think
we
do
not.
i
mean,
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
documents,
that
does
not
in
any
way,
it
seems
to
me,
affect
the
logical
relation
between
the
things
he
says
when
he's
under
compulsion--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
that
that's
perfectly
permissible
under
the
court's
decisions
in
schmerber.
i
mean--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--yes.
now,
let
me
explain.
see,
that's
exactly
the
point.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--the
difficulty,
of
course,
in
that
case
is
it
might
be
that
we
would
have
difficulty
in
proving
that
the
gun
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant,
if
that
was
relevant
to
us.
but
if
we
independently
can
match
up
the
gun
to
the
defendant--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--but,
see,
that
goes
to
your
initial
thing.
you
said,
what's
special
about
documents?
i
think
that
what
fisher
establishes
is
there's
nothing
special
about
documents.
what
the
constitution
does
is
it
breaks
up
production
of
evidence
into
two
classes
of
cases.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well
now,
of
course--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
i
guess
i'm--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--it's
obviously
more
difficult
for
the
government
if
the
government
subpoena
says
turn
over
the
gun
with
which
you
committed
the
murder
because
they're
going
to
have
a
heavier--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--if
we
say--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--suppose
that
the
subpoena
says,
turn
over
all
guns
in
your
possession.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
this
particular
gun.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
okay.
i
would
respond
to
you
with
the
hypothetical
that
justice
stevens
has
in
his
dissent
in
the
second
doe
case
where
he...
in...
which
the
court
accepted
as
being
the
line
that
you've
drawn
in
your
cases
past
schmerber.
if
what
we
do
is
we
tell
the
defendant
give
us
the
key
to
the
strong
box,
it's
full
of
incriminating
documents,
the
answer
is
he
has
to
give
us
the
key.
if
we
tell
him,
tell
us
the
combination
to
the
safe,
we
can't
make
him
do
that.
what
the
constitution
says
is
it
doesn't
care
what
we
get,
it
doesn't
care
where
we
get
it,
it
doesn't
matter
if
we
get
it
from
the
defendant.
the
government
has
a
right
to
every
man's
evidence,
the
court
in
kastigar
emphasized.
what
it
cares
about
is
how
we
get
it.
if
we
get
the
evidence
by
forcing
the
defendant
to
tell
it
to
us,
if
we
force
him
to
restate,
repeat,
or
affirm
the
information,
well,
then
we
lose.
and
so,
if
we
make
him
tell
us
the
combination
to
the
safe,
if
we
make
him
tell
us
the
information
we
want,
well,
then
we
lose.
but
if
what
we
do
is
we
force
him
to
the
physical
act
of
handing
it
to
us,
that's
permissible.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
absolutely.
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
it's
a
distinction
that
the
court
has
had
to
draw.
if
you
look
at
the
opinions
in
schmerber
and
kastigar,
the
court
looks
at
two
important
policies
founded
in
our
history.
one
policy
is
the
principle
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
every
man's
evidence,
and
the
court
talks
about
at
great
length
about
how
important
this
is.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
schmerber
involves
i
think
a
unitary
act
of
production,
and
according
to
the
court
in
schmerber,
it...
that
one
was
analyzed
as
wholly
non-testimonial.
so,
what
we
have
today
is
an
act
of
production
that
under
fisher
has
two
natures
to
it.
it's
a
physical,
non-testimonial
act
of
production.
at
the
same
time,
it
has
implicit
within
it
a
testimonial
communication.
so,
the
question
for
the
court
is
to
decide,
although
the
act
is
not
privileged,
the
communications
are.
and
so
what
you
have
to
decide
is
do
the
contents
of
the
documents
come
from
the
testimonial
portion
of
the
act
or
do
they
come
from
the
conduct.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
and
i...
i
think
that
goes
to
our...
the
second
question
presented,
which
the
second
question
presented
suggests
that
if
the
quantum
of
evidence
that
we
have
about
the
documents
reaches
a
certain
level,
then...
then
it's...
then
it's
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
has
them.
and
our
view
as
to
what
fisher
says
is
that
if
we're
asking
for
simple
business
records,
the
fifth
amendment
simply
isn't
implicated
in
the
same
way--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
on
the
foregone
conclusion
point,
that
may
be
true
if
you
look...
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
but
i
think
one
problem
with
that
analysis
is
that
in
doe
i,
the
court,
of
course,
did
not
itself
examine
the
subpoena.
the
court's
opinion
says
that
it's
accepting
the
factual
findings
of
the
lower
court
and
accepting
the
lower
court's
view
on
that.
and
that's
not
really
the
question
that
the
court
addresses.
but
in
any
event,
in--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
it...
i
don't
think
that
the
subpoena
here
is
significantly
broader
than
the
subpoena
in
fisher.
but
i
think
the
most
important
point
is
to
emphasize
the
relation
between
the
foregone
conclusion
doctrine
that's
at
the
heart
of
justice
o'connor's
question
and
your
question,
and
the
principal
question
that...
that's
presented
in
this
case
because
our...
our
main
submission
is
that
even
if
we
would
not
prevail
on
the
foregone
conclusion
doctrine,
so
even
if
this
production
includes
a
testimonial
incriminating
admission,
the...
the
important
point
in
the
case
is
to
decide
whether
the
contents
of
the
documents
are
derived
from
that
communication.
and
on
that
point,
i
think
we're
on
very
solid
ground
under
fisher
and
doe.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no.
our
view
is
that
in
either
case
we
can
get
him
to
produce...
in
either
case
he's
required
to
provide
the
guns
to
us.
now,
we
have
obtained
from
him
a
slightly
different
testimonial
admission
in
the
two
cases,
but
in
most
prosecutions,
it
strikes
me
that...
that
neither
of
those
will
be--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
i
think
we
probably
would
have
to
show...
well,
we
obviously
would
have
to
show
probable
cause,
and
the
question
is
what
would
probable
cause
require.
and
i
think
in
most
cases
probable
cause
would
require
considerably
less
than...
than--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--absolutely.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
we
obviously
have
to
show
less
to
get
a
subpoena,
but
the
reason
for
that
is
because
when
you
get
a
search
warrant,
you're
going
out
into
somebody's
house.
you're
intruding
in
somebody's
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
home,
and
so
the
court
has
articulated
a
relatively
high
standard
for
that
relatively
intrusive
method
of
obtaining
information
from
citizens.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
the
concern
of
the
constitution
is
entirely
different.
the
constitution
is
not
the
least
bit
concerned
if
we
prosecute
and
convict
somebody
by
evidence
that
we
compulsorily
obtain
from
him.
that
is
completely
legitimate.
that
is
emphasized
repeatedly--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i...
i
think
it's--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well
now,
see,
once
you
say
that
he's
a
suspect
in
the
case,
i
think
at
that
point
you're
saying
that
we
had
some
reason
to
suspect
him,
which
probably
is
enough
reason
to
issue
a
subpoena.
you
can't
say--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
it
takes--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
yes.
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
the
hunch
is
the
r.
enterprises
standard.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
under
the
r.
enterprises
standard,
i
think
that
having
a
hunch
is
more
of
less
what
the
standard
is.
i
mean,
the
court...
the
court
looks
at
this
and
says
grand
juries
traditionally
have
had
very
broad
investigatory
powers,
and
the...
the
requirements
of
knowledge
up
front
to
get
to
issue
subpoenas
are
relatively
small.
the...
the
key
for
us
is
this
is
not
a
testimony
of
communication.
the
act
might
include
one--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
it's
not
at
all
clear
i
think
that
it's
been
rarely
used.
i
mean,
for
one
thing,
in
your
own
decisions
you'll
see
that
we've
been
up
here
several
times
since
fisher
presenting
more
or
less
the
same
question
to
you.
it's
the...
the
implications
of
it,
compelled
production
of
documents,
have
been
up
here
several
times.
another
problem
you
would
see,
to
the
extent
that
it's
not
used
as
frequently
as
you
might
expect,
is
of
course
the
law
is
really
quite
uncertain,
and
anytime
you
do
this,
you're
likely
to
be
faced
with
what
the
court
discussed
in
braswell,
which
is
once
we
force
him
to
say
something
that
includes
any
compelled
testimonial
admission,
we're
faced
with
a
kastigar
hearing
which
is
going
to
slow
down
a
prosecution.
if
we
can
obtain
evidence
in
a
way
that
we
know
is
completely
permissible,
which
we
can't
do
in
this
area
ever
at
the
moment,
then
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
a
kastigar
hearing.
i
mean,
i
think
the
real
problem
is
that
the
law
is
very
uncertain,
but
even
with
the
uncertainty,
there
have
been
enough
prosecutions
that
this
issue
has
been
coming
up
to
the
court
repeatedly
since
fisher.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
immunity
we
gave
is
the
immunity
that
the
statute
grants,
and
the
genius
of
the
statute
is
that
it
avoids
the
necessity
to
litigate
at
the
time
of
a
production
over
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
mean,
in
this
particular
case,
the
immunity
would
prevent
us
from
introducing
into
evidence
or
using
in
our
investigation
the
fact
that
mr.
hubbell
possessed
these
documents.
it
would
prevent
us
from
using
in
the
investigation--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
if
it's
evident...
if
it's
evident
on
their
face
that
they
came
from
him,
then
that
might
mean
we
don't
need
to
use
his
testimonial
communication
against
him.
but
that's
a
harder
question
that's
not
presented
here
because
here
we
have
no
need
to
establish
that
these
documents
came
from
him.
these
are
not
offenses
as
for
which
his
possession
of
these
documents
has
the
least
bit
of
relevance.
if
we
had
to
establish
his
possession
of
these
pieces
of
paper,
we
would
have
something
of
a
kastigar
problem,
and--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
problem
for
us.
i
mean,
my
general
theory
would
be
we
would
lose.
if
we
had
to
prove
that
he
possessed
these
documents
and
his
production
was
the
best
way
to
do
it,
we
would
lose.
i
mean,
assume,
for
example--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
it's
actually
quite
easy
for
us
to
argue,
and
i
think
it's
easy
for
the
reason
that
you
said.
we're
using
these
things
because
he
produced
them
to
us.
he
produced
them
to
us
in
the
same
way
he
would
produce
a
handwriting
exemplar
or
something
else.
i
think
what...
that
the
heart
of
the
case
is
just
a
judgment
call.
did
we
force
him
to
give
us
the
documents,
which
is
perfectly
permissible?
or
did
we
force
him
to
tell
us
the
information?
we
didn't
force
him
to
tell
us
anything
of
value.
everything
of
value
in
the
documents
is
information
that
was
voluntarily
recorded
long
before
we
brought
compulsion
to
bear.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes,
that's
exactly
right.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
