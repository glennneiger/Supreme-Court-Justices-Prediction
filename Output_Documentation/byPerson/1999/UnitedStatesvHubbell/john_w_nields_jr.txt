mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client
was
indicted
in
this
case
at
least
in
part
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
under
immunity
he
told
the
truth.
the
thing
that
he
told
the
truth
about
was
what
documents
he
had
that
were
responsive
to
the
subpoena.
if
he
had
been
untruthful
and
withheld
those
documents,
the
independent
counsel
wouldn't
have
had
them,
but
instead
he
told
the
truth,
turned
them
over,
and
the
independent
counsel
used
those
documents
to
bring
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
no,
and
that
was
because
he
had
asserted
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
respectfully
declining
to
state
whether
he
had
any
documents,
and
he
was
compelled
to
state
whether
he
had
any
by
the
immunity
order.
and
then,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
right,
but...
but
with
an
immunity
order,
the
government
is
required
to
hold
the
defendant
harmless
from
the
truth
that
he
tells.
and
in
this
case,
instead
of
holding
him
harmless,
they
used
the
documents
that
he
revealed
to
them,
truthfully
revealed
to
them,
to
bring
this
indictment.
and,
justice
kennedy,
in
response
to
your
question,
he...
he
was
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
for
17
minutes.
and
the
reason
he
was
there
for
that
length
of
time
is
that
they
needed
him
to
tell
them
what
documents
he
had
that
were
responsive.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
the
incriminating
aspect
of
it
was
that
he
told
them
what
documents
existed
and
were
in
his
possession--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--both.
in
all
cases
a
witness
will
answer
the
question,
the
effective
question,
what
documents
do
you
have?
what
incriminating
documents
do
you
have
that
are
responsive?
he
answers
that
question
by
producing
or
not
producing
documents.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
led
the
government
to
get
incriminating
documents.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
fisher
doesn't
deal,
of
course,
with
immunity,
but
what
fisher
says
is
that
the...
the
testimony
that
is
involved...
and
the
first
thing
that
it
says
is
the
testimony
involved
is
that
the
documents
exist
and
are
in
the
witness'
possession
because
everybody
who
responds
to
a
subpoena
is
required
to
say...
tell
the
government
what
documents
he
has.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i
would
have
to
answer
that
in
two
parts.
the
first
question
is
whether
there's
testimony,
and
that
depends
on
whether
possession
of
income
tax
returns
is
a
foregone
conclusion.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
may
be.
the
case...
the
only
case
i'm
aware
of,
decided
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
has
held
that
it's
not
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
person
has
kept
a
copy
because
there
is
no
legal
obligation
to
keep
a
copy.
but...
but
that
is
a
close
question
i
would
submit.
but
in
answer
to,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
the
point
is
this,
that
the
fifth
amendment
since
1892
has
protected
a
person
from
making
disclosures
or
statements
that--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--counselman
against
hitchcock
was
decided,
your
honor,
and
this
court--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
you're
correct.
i
believe
since
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
but
this
court
pronounced
in
counselman
that
a
witness
is
privileged
from
giving
testimony
that
is
innocuous
in
itself
that
will
lead
the
government
to
obtain
other
incriminating
evidence.
and...
and
what...
what
happens
in
these
document
subpoena
cases
or
the
gun
subpoena
case,
is
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
incriminating
for
the
witness
to
say
this
document
exists,
but
if
the
document
is
one
which
will
cause
him
to
lose
his
liberty
and
if
the
government
only
gets
it
from
him
because
he
truthfully
discloses
in
response
to
the
subpoena
that
it
exists,
then
that
is
privileged--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--it
does.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
does.
the
reasoning
applies
perfectly
unless--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--the
court
holds
that
it's
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
possessed
it,
in
which
case
fisher--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--then
there's
no
testimony
involved
at
all,
so
we
don't
even
get
to
the
question
of
incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it...
i
believe
it
does,
but
it
needs
a
little
more
explanation.
the
court
in
fisher
says
that
the
key
question
is
are
you
relying
on
the
witness'
truth-telling
to
get
the
document,
and
fisher
says
if
it's
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
has
it...
in
fisher,
the...
the
parties
had
admitted
that
they
had
it...
if
it's
a
foregone
conclusion,
then
you're
not
relying
on
the
witness'
truth-telling.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
well,
fisher...
fisher
is
i
believe
quite
clear,
that
the...
the
relevant
language
in
fisher
is...
is
the
language
that
says
that
the
existence
and
possession
of
the
documents
are
a
foregone
conclusion.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
and
therefore...
but
it's
the
therefore...
we're
not
relying--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
okay.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i
think
what
you
do
is...
i
would
do
two
things.
one,
the
principle
is
whether
you're
relying
on
the
truth-telling
of
the
witness
to
find
out
that
the
document
exists.
that's
the
principle.
are
you
relying
on
the
truth-telling
of
the...
that's
testimony.
that's
fifth
amendment
language:
testimony,
truth-telling.
that's
the
issue.
and
if
you
are,
if
you're
compelling
a
person
to
tell
the
truth
with
the
consequence
that
he
loses
his
liberty,
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
the...
the
reason
i
emphasize
truth-telling,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
has
done
so
in
doe
ii.
it
specifically
talks
about
the
question
of
whether
you
are
relying
on
the
witness'
truth-telling
to...
to
gain
the
evidence
you
seek.
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
apply;
if
the
answer
is
yes,
it
does.
it's
also
in
pennsylvania
against
muniz.
both
majority
and
dissent
said
the
fifth
amendment
applies
if
the
witness
is
confronted
with
the
options
of
truth,
falsity,
or
silence.
and--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--it
was
absolutely
adopted
as
the
standard
in
pennsylvania
against
muniz.
and,
indeed,
i
believe
the
dissent
also
referred
to
the
truth-falsity-silence
predicament.
and
our
fundamental
position
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
this,
that
where
the
government
puts
a
person
to
two
choices...
one,
tell
the
truth
and
risk
losing
your
liberty;
and
two,
commit
the
crime
of
falsification
and
maybe
go
free...
the
fifth
amendment
applies
and
extends
to
privilege
of
silence.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
could
pick
out
the
least
one,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
there
was
an
enormous--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--quantity.
there
were
retainer
agreements.
they
weren't
regular.
for
some
clients
there
were
some,
for
some
there
weren't.
there
were
documents
reflecting
the
receipt
of
fees.
they
were
also
not
regular,
but...
but
there
were
a...
a
number
of
those.
there
was
work
product.
the
government
was
trying
to
find
out
whether
he
did
work
for
various
clients,
so
they
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
work
product.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
absolutely
can
serve
the
subpoena,
but
if
the
witness
claims
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
and...
and
he
is...
he
is
compelled
to
disclose
the
existence
under
immunity--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--i
think
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
reason.
i
agree
fisher
is
a
very
significant
case.
and
what
it
does,
by
holding
that
the
contents
of
the
documents
are
not
privileged,
is
it
means
that
the
government
can
get
them
from
a
variety
of
other
sources,
and
the
owner
and
the
person
who's
writing
is
on
the
document
has
no
objection.
and
that's
what
the
government
usually
does.
in
a
small
business--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
correct,
so
that
the
government...
this
is
what
they
usually
do.
they'll...
they'll
go
to
a
small
business
and
they'll
give
a
subpoena
to
a
bookkeeper
or
a
secretary
or
a...
a
document
custodian
or...
or
they
will
go
to
the
other...
if
it's
a...
if
it's
a
communication,
they
go
to
the
other
party
to
the
communication
and
get
the
letter.
if
it's
a
financial
transaction,
they
go
to
a
bank.
they
get
it
from
there.
if
it's
another
financial
transaction,
they
go
to
a
credit
card
company.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes,
but
i
would
put
it
a
slightly
different
way.
you
can't
compel
over
an
immunity
claim.
you
can't
compel
the
subject
of
the
investigation
to
tell
you
what
documents
exist
and
what
documents--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--you
can
command
a
handwriting
example
because
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
well,
but--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--yes,
let
me
address
that.
i
think
it's
important.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
let
me
talk
about
that
whole
line
of
cases,
and
of
course,
we
know
schmerber
is
the
beginning
of
it.
the
point
about
schmerber
is
that
the
witness
there
could
be
the
biggest
liar
or
the
biggest
truth-teller
in
the
world,
and
the
government
will
get
the
same
blood.
it
is
not
relying
on
the
truth-telling
of
the
person
at
all.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
that's
the
assumption
i
believe.
it's
not
stated,
but
the
assumption
is
they
can't
disguise
their
voice.
and
therefore,
a
voice...
a
voice
exemplar
works
regardless
of
the
truth-telling
of...
of
the
witness.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
and
handwriting.
that's
the
hardest
case
in
this
line
in...
in
my
opinion,
but...
and
the
court
doesn't
explain
the
handwriting
decision.
it...
it
states
in
one...
in
one
sentence,
a
mere
handwriting
exemplar,
in
contrast
to
the
content
of
what
is
written,
like
the
voice
or
the
body
itself,
is
an
identifying
physical
characteristic.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it's
the
hardest
case.
however,
i
believe
most
handwriting
experts
will
tell
you
they
think
they
can...
they
think
they
can
identify
even
an
attempted
disguise,
that
there's--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
and
i'd
like
to
give
two
reasons.
the
simple,
easy
one
i
think
is
that
doe
i
held
no.
and
reason
number
two
is
the
one
that
justice
breyer
proffered
which
is
you
may
know
that
a
person
has
records,
but
let's
just
assume
there
is
one
out-of-place,
smoking
gun
document
in
there.
the
government
will
only
get
it
if
the
witness
tells
the
truth
and
produces
not
only
all
the
others,
but
that
one
too.
and,
you
know,
we...
we
civil
litigators
run
up
against
this
all
the
time.
responding
to
a
subpoena
is
a
truth-telling
process,
as
wigmore
said.
it
relies
on
the
witness'
moral
obligation
to
tell
the
truth.
when
we
have
a
big
civil
document
demand,
you...
you
get
all
these
documents
from
the
company
and
you
have
to
hold
the
specs
of
the
subpoena
up
against
the
documents
and
you
have
to
answer
the
question
for
every
document,
and
it's
a
true/false
question.
is
this
document
called
for
by
this
subpoena?
that's
truth-telling.
in
a
civil
context--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--well,
in
a
law
firm,
first
of
all,
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
doesn't
apply
at
all.
that's
bellis
i
believe.
and...
and
second,
in
any
large
business
of
any
size
at
all,
whether
it's
incorporated,
unincorporated,
partner,
it
is
almost
100
percent
of
the
time
going
to
be
easy
for
the
government
to...
to
find
a
document
custodian,
someone
who
has
access
to
the
documents
who
deals
with
them
on
a
regularized
basis
from
whom
they
can
be
subpoenaed.
it's--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--well,
in
this
case
they
didn't
have
that
option
because
in
this
case
my
client's
business
had
terminated
over
a
year
earlier.
it
was
a
very...
there's
no
real
facts
in
the
record
on
this,
your
honor,
but
it
was
a...
essentially
a
one-person
business.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
over.
he
was
incarcerated
at
the
time
and
the
government
simply
had
no
idea
whether
he
had
any
records
or
not.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
no,
and
they
said
so
on
the
record.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
one
is
it
wouldn't
do
a
revolution
at
all.
it
would
leave
things
virtually
exactly
the
way
they've
been
for
the
last
century.
there
has
been
no
time
at
which,
over
a
fifth
amendment
claim,
unincorporated
business
records
have
been
routinely
obtained
by
the
government.
the
only
time
they've
been
obtained...
and
they've
virtually
never
been
obtained
under
immunity.
the
only
time--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--fisher
made
a...
a
very
important
clarification
that
so-called
private
documents,
unincorporated...
documents
of
an
unincorporated
entity,
documents
which
might
have
the
subject's
writing
on
them...
fisher
made
it
very
clear
that
those
documents
were
obtainable
in
any
one
of
a
variety
of
ways
not
involved
compelling
self-incrimination,
including
a
search
warrant.
and
andresen
was
a...
a
decision
this
court
handed
down
the
same
term
as
fisher
which
relied
on
fisher
that
said
a
search
warrant
can
be
issued
for
a
person's
documents
even
though
they
may
have
private
writings
on
them.
so,
fisher
was
an
important
case,
but
if
the
question
is,
has
the
justice
department
or...
or
anyone
been
routinely
subpoenaing
from
the
subject
business
records,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
well,
the
rationale
again
gets
back
to...
you
asked
the
question
are
you
relying
on
the
witness'
truth-telling
to
get
the
evidence
that
you
seek,
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
the
fifth
amendment
applies.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i
mean,
pardon
me
for
saying
so,
but
i
think
that
prosecutors
all
over
the
country
would
fall
down
dead
if
they
thought
they
could
subpoena
guns
or...
or
incriminating
bloody
underwear
or...
or--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--yes.
i
mean,
it
just...
it's
completely
unthinkable.
and
i
would
say
this,
too,
while
we're
on
the
law
enforcement
topic.
one
of
the
things...
not
only
is
this
immunity
that
they
have
issued
here,
according
to
their
understanding
of
it...
not
only
is
it
ineffective
from
my
client's
point
of
view,
ineffective
to
meet
the
constitutional
requirements,
but
it's
ineffective
from
their
point
of
view.
it's...
it's
ineffective
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
the
wonderful
thing
about
immunity
for...
for
law
enforcement
is
that
it
removes
the
witness'
incentive
to
lie
because
it
holds
him
harmless.
it
promises
him
he
won't
be
prosecuted
because
of
anything
that
turns
up.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
in
the
first
doe
case
the
court
held
that
the
act
of
production
is
privileged,
and
the
government,
therefore,
didn't
get
the
documents.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes,
and...
and
that
was
also
said
in
fisher,
and
it's
a
very
important
and
very
true
thing.
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
of...
of
what
do
you
do
if
the
testimony
you
do
compel
leads
you
to
documents.
and...
and
in
the
example
analogous
to
a
gun
where
the...
the
crucial
document
is
some
smoking
gun
document,
is
possessed
by
the
witness,
if
the
witness
is
asked
orally
in
the
grand
jury,
is
there
such
a
document,
where
is
it
located,
and
the
government
goes
and
gets
it,
the
document
isn't
privileged,
but
it's
absolutely
tainted
and
couldn't
possibly
be
used.
but
getting
back
to
the
point
i
was
making
before,
this
kind
of
immunity
says
to
a
witness,
witness,
you
are
obligated
to
turn
over
all
your
documents
and
if
there
are
incriminating
ones
in
them,
i
will
use
them
to
indict
you.
that
is
a
terrible
kind
of
immunity.
it's
not
only
ineffective
for
the
fifth
amendment,
but
it's
ineffective
law
enforcement,
that
you
want
to
be
able
to
tell
the
witness,
now
that
you're
under
immunity,
you
should
give
me
all
your
documents
because
the
only
way
you
can
get
into
trouble
is...
is
to
respond
falsely.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
well,
they
can
do
it
but
not
from
state
prosecutors
i
believe.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
does
that
too.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i
think
it
has
a
harmlessness
element
to
it.
and
i
understand
your
honor's
point
that
there
is,
of
course,
nonetheless,
some
implicit
testimony.
but
i
think
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
government
isn't
relying
upon
the
witness'
truth-telling.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
does
seem
strange.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
well,
the...
the
only
case
in
this
court
in
which
the
foregone
conclusion
doctrine
has
been
applied
is
one
in
which
the
parties
conceded
the
existence
and
location
of
the
documents
and
argued
only
about
their
contents.
the...
the...
in
doe,
the
court
said
existence
and
location
was
not
conceded,
and
they
held
the
fifth
amendment
applied.
in
this
case
my
client
went
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
and
expressly
stated
i
decline
to
say
whether
or
not
there
are
any
documents
responsive--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--it
may
only--
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
--it
might
but
i
would
suggest
this.
this
is
not
a
very
good
case
to
try
to
figure
out
exactly
and
announce
exactly
what
the
rule
is,
exactly
where
you
draw
the
line.
fisher
said
these
cases
should
be
decided
on
their
own
facts.
and
here
we
have
no
facts.
the
government
did
not
even
argue
foregone
conclusion
in
the
lower
court.
there's
no
factual
record
about
what
they
knew,
and
there
won't
ever
be
one
because,
as
the
court
knows,
the
case
is
essentially
over.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
get
into
that.
and
they...
they
adopted
a
test
which
had
previously
been
adopted
by
the
second
circuit,
which
is
the
government
had
to
know
the
documents'
existence
and
possession
with
reasonable
particularity.
that
is
a
test
that
two
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted.
it
strikes
me
as
a
more
relaxed
test
than
foregone
conclusion
which
is
a
pretty
extreme
sounding
phrase.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
it
does
sound
more
like
fourth
amendment.
but
what
i
would
suggest
here
is
that...
that
this
isn't
the
case
to
lay
down
the
exact
standard,
only
to
say
that
the
analysis
has
to
be
are
you
relying
on
the
witness'
truth-telling
to
get
the
document.
and
if
you
are,
it's
testimony
and
the
fifth
amendment
applies.
and
if
you
only
got
an
incriminating
document
because
the
witness
told
the
truth
and
you
got
it
under
immunity,
you
got
to
hold
the
witness
harmless.
you
have
to
leave
him...
as
kastigar
said,
as
emphatically
as
kastigar
could
say,
you
must
leave
him
after
immunity
in
just
as
good
a
position
as
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
been
left
to
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
and
under
doe,
mr.
hubbell
had
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
not
to
tell
whether
he
had
any
of
these
documents.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
problem
with
the
second
one
here
is
that
the
government...
i
expected,
frankly,
in
the
district
court
that
we
would
get
an
inevitable
discovery
position
or
legitimate
independent
source
position,
but
they
didn't
proffer
either.
they
simply
conceded
that
they
had
used
the
information
compelled
under
immunity
to
bring
this
indictment.
mr.
john
w.
nields,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
