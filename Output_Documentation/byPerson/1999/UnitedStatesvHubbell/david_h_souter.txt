justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
your...
that's
your
schmerber
point,
but
i
don't
see
how
schmerber
is...
is
helpful
to
you
here
because
schmerber...
the
instance
in
which
the
individual,
in
effect,
makes
his
bodily...
body
available
for
the
drawing
of
the
blood
sample
and
so
on,
schmerber
does
not
involve
the
implicit
representations
that
are
made,
for
example,
in
this
case
when
the
documents
are
produced
or
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
when
the
individual
implicitly
indicates
that,
yes,
the
gun
is
in
his
possession
by...
by
turning
it
over.
i...
i
don't
see
schmerber
as
being
help
to
you
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what
the...
what
the
person
being
searched
really
cares
about
is
the
fact
that
you
are
intruding
for
the
purpose
of
getting
evidence.
the
concern
of
the
person
who
objects
insofar
as
the
criminal
courts
are
concerned
is
exactly
the
same
in
each
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
very
fact
that
you
were
using
these
documents
rests
upon
the
fact
that...
or...
strike
that.
the
very
fact
that
you
were
using
the
information
that
you
gained
from
these
documents
rests
upon
the
fact
that,
on
the
production
of
the
documents,
their
existence
and
authenticity
were
represented
to
you.
you
are
not
directly
proving
possession,
and
you
are
not
directly
proving
the
authenticity
by
use
of
the
production.
but
what
you
do
use
you
are
using
as
a
result
of
the
production
which
has
these
implications.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
difficult
for
you
to
argue
that
the
use
that
you
are
making
is
not
a
use
which
is
dependent
upon
the
representational
aspect
of
the
production.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you're...
you're
saying
contents,
you
mean
the
information
contained,
in
other
words,
the
information
does
not
become
immunized.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
fact
that
the
information
is
in
the
document
subpoenaed,
that
remains
subject
to
privilege.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
you
can
use
the
information
when
you
get
it
from
all
of
these
other
sources.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
can't
use
the
information
as
a
result
of
its
being
contained
in
the
subpoenaed
document
subject
to
the
immunity
grant.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i...
i
understand.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
the
handwriting
can
be
disguised,
then
the
handwriting
example
would
not
be
in
the
schmerber
line
and
it
would
be
in
the
document--
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it
does
convert
law
enforcement
into
an
essentially
inquisitorial
system--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
you
can
do
that.
would
you
explain
the
foregone
conclusion
doctrine
to
me?
and
the
reason
i...
i
ask
is
this,
to
focus
the
question.
even
in
the
case
in
which
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
some
document
exists,
when
the
government
subpoenas
it
and
the
subject
of
the
subpoena
hands
it
over,
there
at
least
is
implicit
testimony
there
that
the...
the
witness
agrees
the
document
exists.
but...
but
more
precisely,
it...
there's
always
implicit
testimony
that
the
witness
has
the
document
under
his
control
and...
and
that's
why
he's
able
to...
to
hand
it
over.
so
that
even
in
the
case
of
the
foregone
conclusion,
there
is
some
testimonial
aspect,
and
i
suppose
it's
a
testimonial
aspect
to
which
the...
the
later
use
of
the...
of
the
document
can...
can
be
traced.
and
yet,
under
the
foregone
conclusion
doctrine,
we
say,
well,
it
can
be
used
anyway.
the
reason
i
guess
is
not
that
there
is
no
conceivable
use
of
testimony,
but
that
because
of
the
foregone
conclusion,
it's
understood
that
the
government
could
get
it
anyway
by
a
different
means,
e.g.,
a
fourth
amendment
search
warrant.
am
i
right
that
it's
kind
a...
a
harmlessness
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
had
there
not
been
that
stipulation,
i
take
it
the
court
of
appeals
left
it
subject
to
a...
a
remand
to
get
into
that
very
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
sounds
more
like
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
would...
you
would...
i
guess
it
would
be
sufficient
for
you
if
we
said
if
the
government
is
relying,
then
the
government
has
a...
if
it
still
claims
that
it
can
use,
it
has
a
burden
to
come
forward
and
show
something.
and
maybe
it
would
be
enough
for
the
government
to
say,
in
fact,
it's
not
relying
that...
to...
to
rebut
that
conclusion.
but
it
might
also
be
enough
if
the
government
came
forward...
and
this
was
the
suggestion
i
was
making...
and
said
we
don't
have
to
rely
because
we
could
have
gotten
it
by
fourth
amendment
means.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't...
we
don't
choose
between
those
possibilities.
