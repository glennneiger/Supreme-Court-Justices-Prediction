we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
99-166,
united
states
v.
webster
hubbell.
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
think
the
documents
that
were
subpoenaed
here
may
be
an
easier
case
for
you
than
justice
scalia's
gun
hypothesis
because
presumably
virtually
anyone
has
tax
records
and
accounting
records.
it's
no
confession
to
say
that...
to
say
that
those
exist
and
that
they're
in
the
person's
possession.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--for
his
production
of
them.
if...
if
his
production
of
them
is
incriminating,
he--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
then
is
basically
that
your...
this
situation
is
no
different
for
you
than
if
you
had
found
the
documents
on
the
doorstep
of
the
justice
department.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mann.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
nields,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
didn't
have
much
choice
except
to
tell
the
truth,
did
he,
when
he
was
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nields,
what...
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
your
client's
production?
what...
what
was
the
incriminating
aspect
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
he...
he
told
them
by
speaking
not
just
by
producing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
did...
how
did
that
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
that
the
test?
i
don't
think
that's
the
test
laid
down
in
fisher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fifth
amendment
was
adopted
in
1791
i
think.
what
happened
in
1892
to
change
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
presumably
interpreted
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
law--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--rather
than
changed
it
i
trust.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
emphasize
truth-telling,
mr.
nields?
i
mean,
a
witness
can
speak
falsely
and
still
comply
with
the
subpoena,
and
the...
the
remedy
is
perjury
not
some
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
cruel
trilemma,
which
i
think
we've
paid
little
attention
to
in
the
last
few
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
this
is
an...
perhaps
it
wasn't...
an
ordinary
income
tax
fraud
prosecution.
i
mean,
are...
are
you
saying
that
the
government
cannot
subpoena
tax
returns
and
accounting
returns
and
check
records
from...
from
someone
who
it
suspects
of
committing
fraud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then...
then
fisher
becomes
almost
meaningless.
i...
i
had
thought
that
fisher
was
a...
a
very
significant
repudiation
of
boyd.
it
says
that
these
documents
are
not
incriminating.
but
by
your
test
you
simply
come
around
by
another
door
and
achieve
the
same
result
as
boyd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nields,
let
me
interrupt.
you're
saying
then
that
fisher
really
didn't
amount
to
much
of
anything
in
overruling
boyd
if
the
thing
has
been
the
same
for
the
last
century.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nields.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-166,
united
states
against
hubbell
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
