justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how...
how
long
was
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
to
explain
all
these
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he...
he
was
there
for
just
a
few
minutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that
he
had
to
identify
each
document.
obviously,
what
i'm
concerned
with
is
if
you
have
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
for
any
length
of
period,
some
grand
jury
would
say,
oh,
he
looks
shifty
or
he's
not
looking
me
in
the
eye,
all
the
things
jurors
think
about.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
high
degree
of
risk
involved
when
you
have
a
subpoena
of
this
scope
and
of
this
sort,
a
risk
of
incriminating
the
person...
person
through
his
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
have
to
show
anything
in
addition
in
order
to
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment,
that
you
had...
that...
that
these
are
documents
or...
or
items
that
everyone
knows
exists,
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
everybody
knows
that
the
defendant,
the
target,
has
guns
in
his
house,
you
can
have
a
subpoena
say
bring
all
guns
that
are
in
your
house
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
going
just
back
to
the
gun
hypothetical,
i
give
you
two
hypotheticals.
subpoena
a:
produce
all
the
guns
that
are
in
your
possession
and
it's
generally
known
that
the
man
has
lots
of
guns.
subpoena
b:
produce
the
smith
and
wesson.38
with
ivory
handles
and
the
initial
k.
difference
in
those
two
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
how
long
the
defendant
was
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
understand
that,
but
i...
i
can't
seem
to
get
an
answer.
we
were
told,
oh,
just
a
few
minutes,
but
it
takes
me
more
than
a
few
minutes
just
to
read
through
the
whole
subpoena
on
page
47
and
49.
and
i
understood
that
they
asked
him
with
reference
to
each
paragraph
of
the
subpoena,
have
you
produced
these
documents,
which
means
that
there's
a
very
high
risk
that
you're
going
to
be
probing
the
perception,
the
cognition,
the
memory,
the
knowledge
of
this
witness.
and
we're
talking
about
risk
here,
it
seems
to
me,
in
large
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
case
comes
before
the
court
on
the
assumption
that
you
can
use
this
subpoena
of
this
breadth
in
every
drug
prosecution
that
the
government
brings,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
there's
a
very
serious
problem
of
prosecutorial
overreaching
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
very
odd
to
me,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
that...
the
counsel
has
conceded,
as
he
must,
that
you
have
to
have
probable
cause...
you
can
now
have
a
witness
come
live,
a
target
of
investigation,
before
a
grand
jury
with
less
than
probable
cause.
that's
astounding
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
understand
that,
but
with
reference
to
requiring
him
as
well
to
bring
documents
covering
a
tremendously
broad
description.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
your
argument
change
if
the
defendant
were
before
the
grand
jury
for
3
hours
responding
to
every
paragraph
of
this
subpoena
to
see
if
he
complied
with
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
we
are
concerned
with
risk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
doesn't
that
apply
to
your...
to
the
income
tax
question
that
justice
o'connor
said?
give
me
your
income
tax
return
for
the
year
x.--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
government
says,
we've
lost
ours.
give
us
yours.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
court
holds...
i
stipulate
to
that.
it's
a
foregone
conclusion
you've
got
a
copy
of
your
tax
return.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that...
that
just
didn't
fit
your...
your
nice
summary
that
you
gave,
it
seemed
to
me.
he
is
being
convicted
because
he
truthfully
complied
with
a
subpoena
and
they
wouldn't
have
had
the
information
otherwise.
so,
then
your...
your
test
doesn't
quite
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
was
the
document
involved
in
this
case
that's
the
least
ordinary
sort
of
document?
was
there
a
diary
or
something
like
that
or?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
subpoena--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is...
is
enormous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
a
voice
exemplar?
give
me
all
of
the
money.
this
is
a
robbery.
and
then
he
can't
disguise
his
voice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's...
i
took
justice
breyer's
question
as...
as
being
susceptible
of
that
answer
as
well,
that
the
revolution
is...
is
if
we
sustain
a
subpoena
of...
of
this
breadth.
but
the
question
is
what's
the
rationale
we
have
for
drawing
the
line
between
something
that's
very
specific
and
something
that's
this
broad?
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
rationale
is.
