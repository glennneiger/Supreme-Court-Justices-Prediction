mr.
mann,
aren't
you
stretching
fisher?
fisher
was
specific
documents
that
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
accountant,
specific
documents
that
the
accountant
used
to
file
tax
returns,
and
says,
turn
those
documents,
lawyer,
over
to
the
grand
jury.
they
went
from
the
client
to
the
accountant
to
the
lawyer.
but
that
was
documents
used
by
the
accountant
to
file
tax
returns.
this
subpoena
is
far
more
sweeping
and
seems
to
resemble
the
one
in
doe
i
much
more
than
the
one
in
fisher.
so,
if
we're
just
going
by
what
the
court
held
in
those
two
cases,
fisher,
particular
documents;
doe,
broader
documentary
disclosure,
generically
described,
as
in
this
case,
then
one
would
say,
well,
if
we
just
go
on
how
the
court
came
out
at
the
end
of
the
line,
in
fisher
the...
the
government
lost...
the
government
won,
and
in
doe
i
the
government
lost.
this
case
is
more
like
doe
i.
end
of
the
case.
justice
ruth

but
the
court
had
the
subpoena
before
it
and
it
was
one
of
these
sweeping
subpoenas
that
asked
for
all
kinds
of
documents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mann,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the...
initially
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
claimed.
you
said,
okay,
we
give
you
immunity.
we
give
you
use
immunity.
if
i
understand
your
position,
what
you
gave...
the
immunity
that
you
gave
immunized
nothing,
and
if
that's
the
case,
wasn't
there
a
certain
deception
involved
in
saying,
okay,
yes,
he's
got
fifth
amendment
privilege?
we
give
him
immunity,
and
then
the
immunity
shields
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did...
what
did
the
immunity
give
to
hubbell?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
it
obvious
they're
the
papers
that
were
used
to...
to
bill,
to
make
tax
records,
that...
his
phone
records,
his...
his
schedule,
that
they
obviously
came
from
him?
