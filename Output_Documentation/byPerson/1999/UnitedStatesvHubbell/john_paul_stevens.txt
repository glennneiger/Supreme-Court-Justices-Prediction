mr.
mann,
you
didn't
answer
justice
o'connor's
question.
what
do
you
have
to
show?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
to
show
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
have
to
show?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
meant
do
you
have
to
show
anything
before
you
served
the
subpoena
or
to
get
the
subpoena?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mann,
could
i
just
supplement
the
question
justice
kennedy
asked
about
a
specific
gun
and
all
guns
in
your
house?
what
if
you
don't
have
any
idea
that
a
person
ever
owned
a
gun
or
had
it?
could
you
serve
him
with
a
subpoena
and
say,
please
produce
all
the
guns
in
your
possession--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
because
he's
a
suspect
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
have
to
prove
that
you
had
some...
what
does
it
take
to
be
a
suspect
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
have
a
hunch.
this
fellow...
he's
a
bad
guy.
he
might
have
some
guns.
can
you
go
out
and
serve
a
subpoena
on
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
ask
for
all
his
guns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if...
if
it's
that
broad,
why
has
it
been
so
rarely
used
in
the
past?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
presents
a
question
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination
prohibits
the
government
from
using
incriminating
documents
produced
under
a
grant
of
immunity
to
prepare
charges
against
the
immunized
party.
because
the
government
has
not
shown
that
its
evidence
against
respondent
hubbell
was
derived
from
sources
wholly
independent
of
the
testimonial
aspect
of
his
immunized
conduct
in
assembling
and
producing
the
subpoenaed
documents.
we
hold
that
the
indictment
against
him
must
be
dismissed.
the
indictment
at
issue
is
the
second
prosecution
of
hubbell
by
the
independent
counsel
appointed
in
august
1994
to
investigate
possible
violations
of
federal
law
relating
to
the
whitewater
development
corporation.
the
foundation
for
this
prosecution
was
the
subpoena
requiring
hubbell
to
produce
all
documents
in
his
control
that
fit
any
of
several
broad
descriptions.
after
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
receiving
a
grant
of
immunity
coextensive
with
the
scope
of
that
privilege,
hubbell
produced
the
documents.
the
independent
counsel
made
substantial
use
of
those
documents
in
the
investigation
leading
to
the
indictment.
the
district
court
granted
hubbell's
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
holding
that
the
government
use
of
the
subpoenaed
documents
violated
his
grant
of
immunity,
because
all
of
the
evidence
against
him
was
derived
either
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
testimonial
aspects
of
his
immunized
act
of
producing
the
documents.
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
and
remanded
directing
the
district
court
to
permit
the
prosecution
to
proceed
if
the
independent
counsel
could
establish
prior
knowledge
that
the
incriminating
documents
existed
and
were
in
hubbell's
possession.
acknowledging
that
he
could
not
meet
their
standard,
the
counsel
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
we
granted.
our
analysis
of
the
issues
presented
begins
with
the
summary
of
our
prior
cases
interpreting
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
the
equivalent
protection
provided
by
a
grant
of
statutory
use
and
derivative
use
immunity.
a
particular
relevance
in
this
case
is
our
recognition
that
the
act
of
producing
documents
in
response
to
a
subpoena
may
have
an
implicit
testimonial
aspect
that
is
protected
by
the
privilege,
even
though
the
contents
of
the
documents
produced
are
not
protected.
applying
these
principles
to
this
case,
we
conclude
that
hubbell's
act
of
producing
the
subpoenaed
documents
did
have
a
testimonial
aspect
and
that
the
government
made
derivative
use
of
it
in
obtaining
the
indictment
against
him
and
preparing
the
case
for
a
trial.
clearly
the
mental
and
physical
steps
that
subpoena
compelled
hubbell
to
take
in
order
to
provide
the
government
with
an
accurate
inventory
of
the
many
sources
of
requested
evidence,
provided
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
needed
to
prosecute
it.
in
light
of
counsel's
failure
to
show
that
his
evidence
against
hubbell
was
derived
from
sources
wholly
independent
of
these
steps,
the
immunity
granted
to
hubbell
shields
him
from
prosecution.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement.
