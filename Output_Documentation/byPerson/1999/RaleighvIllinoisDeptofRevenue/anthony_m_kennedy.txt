anthony
m.

how
about
judge
posner's
opinion
on
b-8
of
the
appendix?
he
sets
forth
the
cases
that
are
in
your
favor,
but...
which
he
acknowledges
are
a
majority,
and
he
says
the
third
and
fourth
circuits
have
reached
an
opposite
conclusion.
he
cites
landmark.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
noticed
you
cited
in
your
brief
the
vanston
case
in
1940,
1946,
something
like
that,
and
you
don't
cite
the
butner
case
which
the...
or
you
didn't
talk
about
it
in
your
oral
argument,
which
the
respondent
relies
on.
can
you
tell
me,
why
didn't
the
court...
this
court
in
butner
cite
vanston?
you
should
ask
me,
not
him.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
answer
that
it
was
that
vanston
was
pre-amendment
of
the
bankruptcy
code?
