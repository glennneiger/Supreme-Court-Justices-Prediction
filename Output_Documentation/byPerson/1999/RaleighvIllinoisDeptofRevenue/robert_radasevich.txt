mr.
robert
radasevich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
the
case
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
taxing
authorities
should
be
subjected
to
shoulder
the
same
burden
of
persuasion
as
other
creditors
in
bankruptcy
to
prove
the
allowance
of
their
claims.
we
think
it's
essential,
in
resolving
that
question,
to
note
that
the
validity
of
claim
under
state
law
is
not
the
same
as
the
allowance
of
a
claim
under
the
bankruptcy
code
and
under
the
bankruptcy
act
which
preceded
the
code.
this
court's
prior
decision
in
vanston
is
illustrative
of
that
dichotomy.
bankruptcy
is
fundamentally
a
process
which
realters
and
restructures
debtor-creditor
relationships.
when
matters
of
state
law
giving
rise
to
rights
between
parties
are
at
odds
or
are
inconsistent
with
policies
or
procedures
underlying
the
bankruptcy
code,
those
aspects
of
state
law
give
way.
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
general
practice
under
the
bankruptcy
act
was
to
require
taxing
authorities,
like
all
other
creditors,
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
persuasion
to
establish
the
allowance
of
their
claims.
mr.
robert
radasevich
we
recognize
in
our
moving
papers,
your
honor,
that
there
was
aberrant
authority
that
took
the
position
that
taxing
authorities
did
not
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
their
claims.
mr.
robert
radasevich
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
radasevich
the
basis,
your
honor,
is
the
decisions
that
come
down
and
the
volume
of
the
decisions
that
came
down
on
the
side
of
the
equation
that
taxing
authorities
bear
the
same
burden.
the
statements
in
collier's
which
this
court
recognized
in
kelly
as
an
authoritative
treatise
as
to
what
the
standard
of
pre-code
practice
was,
with
no
indication
of
any
alternative
viewpoint,
took
the
position
that
the
burden...
that
taxing
authorities
bore
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
tax
claims.
when
congress
enacted
the
bankruptcy
code
of
1978,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
it
gave
careful
consideration
to
the
treatment
of
tax
claims
in
bankruptcy
estates.
the
legislative
history
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
i
believe
on
page
16,
indicates
that
congress
was
concerned
about
the
interplay
between
creditor
rights
of
ordinary
trade
creditor
variety,
consensual
trade
creditors,
the
interests
of
the
debtor,
and
the
interests
of
taxing
authorities--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--many
of
the
cases
that
were
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief
we
don't
believe
stood
for
the
proposition
that
the
taxing
authorities
bore
the
burden
of
persuasion.
mr.
robert
radasevich
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
were
decisions
on
both
sides
of
the
equation.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
there
weren't
decisions
on
both
sides
of
the
equation.
what
we
argued
in
our
briefs
was
that
what
appeared
to
be
the
majority
view
under
the
act,
and
which
collier's
thought
was
a
majority
view
under
the
act,
was
that
taxing
authorities
bore
the
same
burden
of
persuasion
as
other
creditors.
whether--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--excuse
me.
mr.
robert
radasevich
yes.
the
code
and
the
act
before
it
were
silent,
your
honor,
and
we
do
agree
that
because
there
was
no
decision
from
this
court
under
the
act
it's
proper
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
rationale
of
placing
the
burden
either
on
taxing
authorities
or
on
the
objecting
party
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
if
the
court
determines
that
there
wasn't
a
predominant
practice
under
the
act,
so
that
it
was...
congress
was
deemed
to
have
accepted
that
practice
under
the
code,
certainly
practice
under
the
act
and
the
legislative
history
under
the
code
is
illustrative
of
the
concerns
that
congress
had,
and
i
think
it's
helpful
to
this
court
in
reaching
its
decision
as
to
where
the
burden
of
proof
should
lie.
mr.
robert
radasevich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
radasevich
the
validity
of
claims
under
nonbankruptcy
law
is
not
the
same
as
the
allowance
of
those
claims
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
if
the
court
hearkens
back
to
its
vanston
decision,
in
vanston
what
the
issue
was
was
whether
interest
on
interest
was
due
in
an
indentured
bond
situation.
what
the
court
found
was
that
because
the
bankruptcy
code--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--bankruptcy
act.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
since
the
bankruptcy
act
changed
the
relationship
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
the
debtor's
ability
to
make
payments,
that
allowing
the
creditor
to
obtain
interest
on
interest,
which
was...
the
court
assumed
was
valid
under
the
prevailing
state's
law,
it's
inequitable
to
other
creditors
of
the
estate.
so
the
court
didn't
focus
on
whether
the
entire
claim
of
the
creditor
was
invalid.
it
focused
on
a
small
aspect
of
the
claim.
mr.
robert
radasevich
absolutely
it
does,
your
honor.
the
bankruptcy
code
gives
taxing
authorities
benefits
in
several
different
areas,
and
the
legislative
history
that
we
cited
indicates
the
best
result
of
congress'
concern
about
the
interplay
of
taxes
and
creditor
rights
and
rights
of
bankrupt
debtors.
but
this
court
also
recognized
in
whiting
pools
and
in
energy
resources
that
just
because
taxing
authorities
or
other
creditors
are
given
priorities,
are
favored
in
one
portion
of
the
act,
does
not
necessarily
mean
they're
favored
in
others,
and
when
congress
attempted
to
balance
the
interests
of
taxing
authorities,
other
creditors,
and
the
debtor,
it
did
so
by
giving
taxing
authorities
and
banks
tier
priority.
mr.
robert
radasevich
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
what
judge
posner
held
in
his
decision.
we
respectfully
disagree
that
in
filling
a
gap,
essentially,
in
the
text
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
this
court
is
required
to
adopt
state
law.
mr.
robert
radasevich
burden
of
proof
were
matters
of
substantive
law
under
erie,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
radasevich
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
argument
of
the
government,
your
honor,
and
our
response
is
that
bankruptcy
historically
alters
debtor-creditor
relationships
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
every
single
case,
and
burdens
of
persuasion
which
exist
outside
of
a
bankruptcy
context
and
are
meant
to
allocate
risk,
are
designed
to
allocate
risk
between
litigants,
we
don't
think
apply
in
a
bankruptcy
context
when
parties
in
interest
are
different.
in
a
bankruptcy
context
this
court
has
found
repeatedly
it
transfers
claims
against
the
debtor,
legal
claims
against
that
debtor,
to
equitable
claims
against
assets
which
comprise
a
bankruptcy
estate.
it's
no
longer
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
litigating
with
mr.
stoecker.
they
have
the
ability
to
continue
to
do
that
outside
of
bankruptcy,
like
most
taxing
authorities,
because
tax
claims
by
and
large,
unless
they're
extremely
stale,
are
nondischargeable
under
section
520(p)
irrespective
of
whether
a
proof
of
claim
is
ever
filed
or
allowed.
mr.
robert
radasevich
your
honor,
if
you
start
with
the
presumption
that
the
government's
claim
is
based...
their
tax
claim
is
based
upon
something,
often
their
internal
audits
and
internal
assessments,
if
we
look
at
what
happens
when
they
file
a
claim
under
section...
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
the
prima
facie
validity
of
that
claim
that
ascribes
under
section
3...
under
bankruptcy
rule
3001(f),
it's
not
the
government's
initial
burden
at
that
point
to
do
anything.
the
burden's
on
whoever
the
objecting
party
is,
be
it
the
taxpayer,
a
creditor,
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy
trustee,
or
a
creditor's
committee,
to
introduce
an
argument,
evidence
of
an
argument
of
equal
probative
value,
which
is
the
standard
that
a
lot
of
courts
talk
about
when
they
talk
about
displacing
the
prima
facie
validity
of
the
claim
in
order
to
shift
the...
to
make
the
creditor,
the
taxing
authority
come
up
with
additional
evidence
to
prove
its
claim,
so
it--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
burden
of
proof
attendant
to
tax
claims
is
as
much
substantive
of
those
claims
as
the
burden
of
proof
on
any
other
claim.
congress
and
state
governments,
state
legislatures
have
decided
that
because
of
certain
policy
reasons
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
an
assortment
of
different
tax
claims
should
be
borne
on
the
taxpayer
rather
than
the
taxing
authority.
those
policy
reasons
are
generally
recordkeeping
requirements,
access
to
documentation,
and
knowledge
about
the
underlying
tax
claim.
those
interests
are
not
disserved
by
placing
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
a
taxing
authority
in
a
bankruptcy
estate
because
of
the
way
claims
are
adjudicated
in
bankruptcy.
because
the
taxpayer
has
to
come
forth
with
credible
evidence,
hopefully
supported
by
records,
in
order
to
counter
the
prima
facie
validity
of
the
claim,
we
think
those
same
purposes
are
served.
for
example,
in
landbank,
the
decision
that
holds
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
on
the
taxpayer,
on
the
objecting
party
in
bankruptcy,
in
that
case
the
taxing
authority
filed
a
proof
of
claim
and
based
upon
an
estimated
valuation
of
bad
loss,
bad
debt
losses,
the
objecting
trustee
said
no,
you
should
figure...
you
should
determine
bad
debt
losses
based
upon
the
actual
accounting
method,
but
the
court's
opinion
indicates
that
nobody
had
any
records
of
what
the
bad
debt
losses
under
the
actual
accounting
method
was.
in
that
instance,
the
objecting
creditor
failed
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
the
taxing
authority's
case.
the
taxing
authority's
case
in
landbank,
the
taxing
authority
would
have
won
even
if
the
burden
of
persuasion
would
have
been
on
the
taxing
authority,
because
the
debtor,
without
adequate
records,
without
justifiable
evidence
to
rebut
the
presumption,
can't
overcome
the
validity
of
the
tax
claim.
mr.
robert
radasevich
the
illinois
department
of
revenue's
evidence
consisted
of
the
notice
of
penalty
or
liability
that
was
issued
by
the--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
radasevich
yes,
your
honor.
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by...
on
behalf
of
the
trustee
was
an
opinion
of
counsel
of
the
target
company,
chandler
enterprises,
that
the
subject
transaction
was
exempt
from
taxes
as
an
occasional
sale.
they
also
have
the
certificate
of
exemption
from
the
seller
indicating
that
it
had
only
sold
one
airplane,
ever,
and
it
was
an...
this
was
an
exempt
sale.
it
also
had
the
testimony
of
the
lawyer
supporting
those
arguments,
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
prewitt
from
the
leasing
company
supporting
those
arguments.
what
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
had,
as
indicated
by
brenda
thompson,
her
testimony,
was,
when
chandler
never
responded
to
the
notice
of
tax
liability
against
it
because
it
was
only
a
shell
and
its
principal
was
in
bankruptcy,
it
checked
with
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
and
found
out
that
mr.
stoecker
was
an
officer
and
director,
as
was
an
individual
named
larry
pluhar.
based
upon
that
evidence
and
that
evidence
alone,
when
they
didn't
respond
to
letters
they
issued
notice
of
penalty
and
liabilities
against
mr.
stoecker
and
mr.
pluhar
with
zero
evidence
that
they
were,
in
fact,
responsible
or,
in
fact,
willful,
so
we
believe
that
the
evidence
that
we
offered,
which
was
the
opinion
letters
and
the
certificates
and
the
testimony,
was
sufficient
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
the
validity...
was
at
least
equal
to
the
probative
value
of
the--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--your
honor,
mr.
stoecker
is
currently
a
guest
of
the
federal
government,
residing
at
a
facility
in
wisconsin,
and--
[laughter]
mr.
robert
radasevich
during
the
trial--
[laughter]
mr.
robert
radasevich
during
the
trial,
your
honor,
his
deposition
was
taken
and
he
asserted
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
in
fact,
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
attempted
to
assert
the
inferences
arising
from
the
assertion
of
a
fifth
amendment
right
against
the
trustee.
that
did
not
fly,
because
the
trustee
is
not
the
debtor.
we
are
fundamentally
not
the
taxpayer.
we
are
a
chapter
7
trustee
operating
for
the
benefit
of
our
creditors.
mr.
robert
radasevich
actually,
your
honor,
the
trial
court
judge
squires
found
that
under
state
law
the
burden
of
persuasion
was
on
the
taxing
authority,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
came
down
with
a
decision
during
the
middle
of
our
case
which
clarified
that
point,
and
found
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
was
on
the
taxpayer.
judge
squires,
then
affirmed
by
judge
anderson,
found
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
a
claim
objection,
on
the
allowance
of
a
claim
in
bankruptcy
fell
with
the
trustee.
the
court
found
that
we
rebutted
the
presumption.
the
court
did
not
make
the
alternative
finding
that
if
the
burden
was
on
the
taxpayer--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--judge
anderson,
your
honor.
judge...
i'm...
excuse
me.
judge
squires,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
radasevich
he
was
the
bankruptcy
judge,
and
he
found
that
the
evidence
that
we
submitted
was
sufficient
to
rebut
the
presumption.
in--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--no,
judge...
your
honor.
excuse
me.
no,
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
we
have...
these
issues
have
been
hanging
around
in
this
case
since
we
started
litigating
in
1992.
mr.
robert
radasevich
your
honor,
in
the
beginning
we
had
a
host
of
different
arguments.
[laughter]
we're
down
to
one.
mr.
robert
radasevich
yes,
i'm
trying
to--
[laughter]
mr.
robert
radasevich
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
what
was
going
on
in
butner
was
whether
there
was
a
federal
interest
underlying
the
need
to
have
a
uniform
rule
around
the
country
about
what
a
secured
lender
has
to
do
once
bankruptcy
is
filed
to
perfect
a
security
interest
in
rents.
the
court
found
that
that,
much
like
whether
a...
how
you
establish
a
contract
claim
in
connecticut,
or
how
you
do
a
tort
claim
in
arizona,
is
the
constituent
elements
of
the
rights
of
parties
are
determined
under
state
law.
the
court
found
that
the
rights
of
a
secured
lender
under
state
law
to
obtain
rents
on
property
should
be
left
to
state
law.
there's
no
overriding
federal
interest
to
make
it
otherwise.
you
compare
that
case
with
the
court's
decision
in...
so
it
didn't
need
to
discuss
vanston
because
there
wasn't
an
impact
on
creditors.
you
converge
that
case
with
a
case
like
rash,
where
the
court
determined
that
in
order
to
determine
the...
what
constituted
value
of
collateral
under
section
506
and
a
cram-down
under
section
1335.
you
don't
look
at
what
the
secured
creditor
would
get
under
state
law,
which
is
the
foreclosed
value
of
the
collateral.
you
look
at
it
from
the
debtor's
perspective
in
bankruptcy
court
and
you
determine
that
it's
important
for
uniformity
and
predictability
cases
that
we
have
a
uniform
rule
that
should
be
the
fair
market
value
of
the
collateral
and
not...
without
reference
to
state
law.
mr.
robert
radasevich
your
honor,
i
think
the
cases
cited...
excuse
me.
i
think
the
cases
cited
by
the
department
and
the
amici
in
those...
in
that
regard
are
affirmative
defense
cases.
you
assume
that
the
claim
is
valid.
you
introduce
an
affirmative
defense
of
statute
of
limitations.
you
assume
the
debt
is...
that
the
instrument
says
that
interest
was
supposed
to
be
at
this
rate.
you
bring
in
the
affirmative
defense
that
that
rate
is
usurious
under
illinois
law.
mr.
robert
radasevich
i'm
not
looking
to...
strike
that.
the
trustee
is
not
looking
to
establish
a
rule
going
to
who
should
have
the
burden
on
various
different
types
of
affirmative
defenses
without
looking
at
what
the
underlying
case
is.
what
we
are
looking
for
is
a
rule
that
says,
creditors,
when
it
comes
to
proving
the
prima
facie
evidence,
the
prima
facie
validity
of
their
claim,
can
rely
on
their
proof
of
claim.
when
it
comes
to
a
situation
where
that
claim
is
rebutted,
taxing
authorities
in
bankruptcy
should
be
treated
no
differently
than
any
other
creditor
when
it
comes
to
the
allowance
of
their
claim,
because
congress...
there's
no
indication
that
congress
thinks
that
it
should.
when
congress
thinks
that
they
need
an
extra
time
period
to
file
burdens
of
proof,
or
file
proofs
of
claim,
because
they
have
an
awfully
hard
time
getting
their
records
together
and
because
they
tend
to
be
bureaucratic
beasts,
they
give
them
additional
time
periods
to
file
proofs
of
claim.
they
give
them
dischargeability
notices.
they
give
them
priorities
of
claim.
but
the
eight
groups
of
creditors
that
have...
or
the
seven
groups
of
creditors
that
have
priorities
above
taxing
authorities
all
have
to
prove
their
claims.
when
this
court
in--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--it
did
in
section
547,
your
honor,
which
deals
with
preferences,
and
there's
a
burden
of
proof
allocation
in
section
547
of
the
bankruptcy
code
where
congress
says
that
basically
the
trustee
or
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
prima
facie
elements
of
a
preference
claim,
and
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
have
the
burden
of
proof...
they
never
say
persuasion...
burden
of
proof
on
the
subsection
(c)
matters
which
are
in
the
nature
of
affirmative
defenses,
that
it
was
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
et
cetera.
mr.
robert
radasevich
we
would
likewise
place
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
creditor
in
bankruptcy
to
establish
its
claim,
yes,
your
honor.
as
it
comes
to
pass,
our
research
didn't
indicate
many
other
situations
where
creditors
have
burdens
of
proof.
mr.
robert
radasevich
there
was
a
case--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--there
are
presumptions
that
arise
in
certain
federal
taxing
concepts.
there's
one
under
the
black
lung
act,
something
called
the
true
doubt
rule,
that
if
somebody
works
in
the
mine
for
40
years
and
gets
lung
disease,
pretty
good
bet
it's
a
result
of
him
working
in
the
mine.
the
court,
though,
in
a
decision
the
name
of
which
escapes
me
found
that
that
true
doubt
presumption
doesn't
hold
in
cases
under
the
administrative
procedures
act,
because
the
administrative
procedures
act
says
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
should
be
on
the
claimant.
burden
of
procedures,
or
the
administrative
procedures
act,
administrative
review
act
is
different
than
bankruptcy.
bankruptcy
is
not
a
venue.
bankruptcy's
a
process,
and
that
process
requires
that
all
creditors,
taxing
authorities
and
otherwise,
bear...
shoulder
the
same
burden
of
persuasion
to
establish
their
claims.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
robert
radasevich
thank
you.
mr.
robert
radasevich
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
one
point
during
my
rebuttal,
and
that's
the
other
five
code
sections
which...
in
which
congress
did,
in
fact,
determine
an
allocation
of
the
burden
of
persuasion.
the
first
three
are
instances
where
congress
allocated
the
burden
to
two
separate
parties
in
litigation
on
different
things
that
were
involved
in
the
matter.
under
section
547,
as
i
discussed
with
justice
ginsburg,
the
prima
facie
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
the
affirmative
defenses
are
on
the
defendant.
under
section
362,
dealing
with
modification
of
the
automatic
stay,
the
movant
has
certain
burdens,
the
debtor
has
other
burdens.
under
section
363,
dealing
with
the
use,
sale,
and
lease
of
property,
the
debtor
has
certain
burdens
where
the
trustee,
the
party
asserting
an
interest
in
the
property
has
other
burdens.
so
congress
split
the
burdens
because
there
were
a
bunch
of
things
going
on.
that's
not
what
we
have
in
claim
objections.
mr.
robert
radasevich
it
was
a
claim
that
had
not
been
administratively
adjudicated
except
for
the
issuance
of
the
npl,
which
is
the
assessment.
after
that,
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
found
out
about
the
bankruptcy.
they
didn't...
this
certain
department,
though
they
had
filed
other
claims,
didn't
know
about
the
bankruptcy.
they
issued
the
npl,
filed
proof
of
claim,
judge
posner
in
his
decision
recognized
that
that
proof
of
claim
was
subject
to
challenge
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
administratively,
so
they
recognized
there
was
a
procedure
there
that
was
not
completed
because
of
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
robert
radasevich
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
robert
radasevich
--sure.
mr.
robert
radasevich
absolutely.
mr.
robert
radasevich
absolutely.
mr.
robert
radasevich
justice
breyer,
i've
read
title
vii
cases
which
has
a
burden,
but
that's
really
a
burden
of
shifting
the
production.
the
burden
of
persuasion
ultimately
remains
with
the
claimant.
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
and
the
other
two
code
sections
where
congress
did
specifically
set
forth
the
burden
of
persuasion,
1129
deals
with
the
right
unique
to
taxing
authorities
to
trump
plans
if
the
plans
are
meant
to
defeat
taxes.
rather
than
have
the
debtor
prove
the
negative
that
a
plan
is
not
designed
to
defeat
taxes,
the
taxing
authority
has
to
argue
and
prove
it.
under
364,
dealing
with
obtaining
credit,
the
usual
rules,
you
can
obtain
unsecured
credit.
if
you
can't,
subsection
(b)
says
give
them
an
administrative
claim.
if
that
doesn't
work,
give
them
a
superadministrative
claim
and
a
junior
lien
on
assets.
if
that
doesn't
work,
give
them
a
super-duper
administrative
claim
and
a
charging
lien
on
all
assets,
but
if
you're
going
to
do
that,
trustee,
then
you
better
have...
you're
going
to
sustain...
substantiate
the
burden
of
persuasion
to
show
that
those
creditors
whose
rights
you're
priming
in
assets
have
been
received
adequate
protection.
that's
the
exception
to
the
rule,
and
congress
allocated
a
burden
of
persuasion
dealing
with
that
exception.
the
usual
rule
in
bankruptcy
allocates
the
burden
of
persuasion
to
all
parties.
had
congress
wanted
to
claim...
to
establish
an
exception
for
taxing
authorities,
they
could
have.
they
didn't.
we
don't
think
this
court
should
either.
thank
you
very
much.
