justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
decision
from
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
you
characterize
as
aberrant
one
side
rather
than
the
other.
what
is
your
basis
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
that
mixed
picture
i
think
would
have
the
obligation
to
decide
which
is
the
better
view,
since
we're
not
bound
by
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
pre-code
split.
there
is
nothing
definitive
earlier,
so
shouldn't
the
proper
role
for
this
court
be
to
decide
what
is
the
better
position?
there
is...
the
code
itself
is
totally
silent
on
this
issue,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
radasevich,
i
think
you're
now
talking
about
the
distinction
between
the
burden
of
coming
forward,
which
you
concede
that
the
taxpayer
would
have,
and
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion,
but
it
is
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
that's
critical
here,
and
why
isn't
it
part
and
parcel
of
the
substantive
right?
that
is,
this
is
not
just
any
general
rule
about
burden
of
persuasion.
this
is
a
rule
that
is
stuck
together
with
a
certain
kind
of
claim.
this
is
a
rule
not
for
claims
generally,
but
for
tax
cases,
so
we
tend
to
think
of
built-in
statutes
of
limitations,
rules
about
processing,
if
you
will,
but
that
go
together,
that
we
have
in
other
contexts
called
part
and
parcel
of
the
substantive
right,
and
so
it
doesn't
answer
that
question
to
say,
well,
the
taxpayer
would
have
a
burden
of
coming
forward.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
the
case
that
at
least
the
trial
court
here
said,
yeah,
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
the
burden
of
proof
does
matter.
i'm
in
equipoise.
they
have
what...
a
good
case,
the
other
side
has
a
good
case.
there
were
gaps.
given
that
situation,
i
am
deciding
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
burden
of
persuasion.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
some
judge
in
this
case
who
said,
this
is
a
case
where
there
are
gaps
in
the
evidence,
and
it's
one
of
those
cases
where
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
determinative.
now,
which
judge
said
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
was
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought,
mr.
goldgar,
that
mr.
radasevich
had
said
if
there
were
other
claims
that
were
like
the
tax
claims,
his
rule
would
be
the
same,
but
he
said
on
inspection
there
weren't
many,
that
most
of
the
others
were
affirmative
defense
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there?
he
didn't
fully
answer
that.
he
said
there
weren't
many,
but
he...
and
he
gave
the
black
lung
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
know
of
any.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
a
bankruptcy
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding,
so
it's
not
a
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
were
we
talking
about?
what
was
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
your
point
is,
waiting
till
after
could
be
more
theoretical
than
real,
because
the
chances
that
he
would
amass
900,000
dollars--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
it's
not
just
erie,
is
it?
as
i
understand
it,
in
choice
of
law
generally
the
burden
of
persuasion
would
go
with
the
substantive
right,
so
if
we
were
making
a
state-state
judgment,
and
illinois
is
applying
the
law
of
indiana
to
a
particular
claim,
with
that
law
would
go
indiana's
burden
of
proof
and
not
illinois,
so
it's
not
just
a
vertical
erie,
but
a
horizontal--
