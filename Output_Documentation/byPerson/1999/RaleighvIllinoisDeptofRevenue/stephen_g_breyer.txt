justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
you
just
call
him
to
the
stand,
stoecker,
and
say,
look,
did
you
get
the
letters
to
the
lawyer?
yes.
did
you
think
you
were
liable
for
tax
in
illinois?
no.
okay,
thank
you
very
much,
and
then
you
would
have
won.
so
why...
i
mean,
it...
what
justice
souter
said,
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
much
difference
where
the
burden
of
proof
is,
frankly,
and
this
seems
like
a
case
that
illustrates
that,
and
on
the
state
of
mind,
where
it's
willful,
i
mean,
you'd
think
that
mr.
stoecker
was
the
best...
is
the
best
witness
in
respect
to
that,
and
if
he
doesn't
show
up,
you
begin
to
get
suspicious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
might
be
easier
to
locate
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
i
notice
that
the
government
on
page
15
of
their
brief
cites
a
large
number
of
cases
that
really
come
out
of
the
amici
briefs
of
the
states.
they
have
four
where
they
say
burden
of
proof
is
shifted.
it
isn't
always
the
creditor,
and
they
say
there
are
tyler
cases,
there
are
laches
cases,
there
are
accord
and
satisfaction
and
usurious
debt
cases,
so
there
are
a
bunch
of
them
where
really
the
burden
is
not
on
the
creditor,
and
this
is
just
one
more
of
those.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
are
those
accurate,
and
if
they
are
accurate
in
your
opinion,
why
isn't
this
just
one
more
of
those?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
truth
in
lending
act
an
affirmative
defense
case,
too?
i
can
see
the
others.
you'd
argue
for
the
simple
rule,
you'd
say,
all
right,
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
the
burden
shifts,
otherwise
not,
and
they're
arguing
for
the
simple
rule,
let's
look
to
see
what
it
is
under
state
law
and
treat
it
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
the
congress
didn't
say
anything
about
affirmative
defenses,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's...
look,
he
had
very
good
answers
to
my
questions.
i
was
trying
to
think,
just
following
up
on
what
justice
scalia
says,
it
seemed
to
me
fairly
easy,
this
case,
because
it
seemed
like
there
are
a
lot
of
instances
in
which
you
go
into
bankruptcy
and
really
it's
not
the
creditor
that
has
to
prove
the
claim,
it's
somebody
else,
all
right,
just
like
this,
and
then
every
one
of
those
he
says,
with
a
very
few
exceptions,
maybe
tyler,
is
really
not
so.
it's
an
affirmative
defense.
so
i
wonder
if
you
can
be
borne
out
historically.
and
then
he
had...
his
second
answer
was,
look,
when
you
shift
the
burden
of
proof
in
an
ordinary
nonbankruptcy
context,
obviously
the
taxpayer
can
go
in
and
declare
his
state
of
mind,
for
example,
or
the
records,
but
here
it's
not
the
taxpayer
who's
at
issue.
it's,
let's
say
the
widows
and
orphans
who
are
the
other
creditors,
and
they
have
no
easier
access
to
that
taxpayer
than
you
do.
you
all
start
out
with
the
same
nonaccess
or
access,
so
why
shouldn't
you
have
to
call
mr.
stoecker
in
just
as
you're
saying
they
should
have
to
call
mr.
stoecker
in.
so
if
there's
no
tradition,
and
if
the
reason
disappears,
why
should
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
i
understand
that's
the
conclusion,
but
the...
to
get
to
that
conclusion
you're
going
to
have
to
show
some
kind
of
history,
tradition,
or
reason,
and
those
were
the
parts
that
i
wanted
to
hear
your
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
why,
for
example,
although
you
have
a
good
reason
for
saying
the
taxpayer
should
pay
the
burden
where
it's
state
v.
taxpayer,
namely
taxpayer
has
the
ability
to
keep
the
records,
et
cetera,
you
do
not
have
that
good
reason
where
it's
state
v.
widows
and
orphans,
and
the
taxpayer
is
equally
inaccessible
to
all
of
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not...
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
response
is
to
what
i
take
to
be
his
responses
to
what
i
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
still,
i'm
just
curious
what
the
answers
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
are
your
best
historical
or
traditional
examples,
an
example
of
an
instance
that
isn't
an
affirmative
defense,
where
congress
is
silent,
and
where
state
law
or
some
other
law
puts
the
burden
not
on
the
plaintiff
or
the
creditor
but
somebody
else,
and
that's
followed
into
bankruptcy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
your...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
would
be
the
only
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
for
you
to
win,
then,
we're
saying
tax
cases
are
special.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
state
tort
tax
cases
are
special,
or
we're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
we're
saying
if
the
state
passes
these
burden
of
proof
things
in
other
areas
they
get
followed
into
bankruptcy,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so,
why
doesn't
the
state
just
have
a
law,
say
we
always
win,
or,
you
know,
a
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--would
say,
if
it's
in
bankruptcy
the
burden
shifts
to
the
other
side?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
is
there
any
other
instance
you
could
think
of
where
bankruptcy
courts
follow
a
different
burden
where
congress
has
been
silent?
