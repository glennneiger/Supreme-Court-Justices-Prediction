mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
our
self-assessment
and
self-reporting
systems
of
state
and
federal
taxation
the
traditional
burden
of
proof
on
the
taxpayer
is
not
a
peripheral
matter.
it's
essential
to
the
successful
functioning
of
tax
authorities
and
to
providing
an
incentive
for
the
maintenance
of
adequate
records
to
enable
fair
determinations
of
tax
liabilities
to
be
made.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
correct
in
pointing
out
that
the
code
addresses
burden
of
persuasion
in
a
number
of
contexts
but
not
with
respect
to
burden
of
persuasion
on
tax
claims,
and
referred
to
its
silence
as
eloquent.
actually,
there
is
perhaps
something
more
than
silence
that
implies
an
answer
to
this.
tax
claims
arise
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
sometimes
in
the
form
of
judgments
that
have
been
adjudicated
by
tax
tribunals,
whether
state
or
federal,
but
have
not
yet
been
paid,
and
sometimes
as
claims
that
have
not
been
reduced
to
judgment,
and
in
the
section
of
the
code,
section
505
of
title
xi,
entitled
determination
of
tax
liability,
congress
explicitly
addresses
the
situation
when
a
tax
claim
is
reflected
in
a
judgment.
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
section
(a)(1),
subsection
(a)(1)
of
section
505,
a
provision
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
but
not
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
does
give
the...
a
bankruptcy
court
authority
to
determine
the
amount
or
legality
of
any
tax
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
2,
and
paragraph
2
of
section
505(a)
says
that
the
bankruptcy
court
may
not
make
that
determination
if
the
amount
or
legality
has
been
contested
before
and
adjudicated
by
a
judicial
or
administrative
tribunal
of
competent
jurisdiction.
then
that
judgment
is
binding
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
now,
two
observations
might
be
made
about
this
in
a
search
for
congruity
in
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
themselves
with
respect
to
tax
claims,
first
that
by
1978,
when
these
provisions
were
enacted
in
the
code,
it
was
very
familiar
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies
in
these
tax
adjudications
and
congress
was
comfortable
in
giving
conclusive
effect
to
those
that
have
been
adjudicated
in
a
tribunal.
but
the
other,
rather
strong
implication
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
being
told
it's
bound
by
those
determinations,
but
when
those
determinations
have
not
been
made
by
a
tax
tribunal,
then
the
implication,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
should
be
acting
as
the
surrogate
for
the
tribunal
that
ordinarily
makes
these
tax
determinations
and
should
try
to
reach
the
result
that
would
otherwise
be
binding
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
in
the
spirit
of
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins.
this
is
a
question
governed
by
tax
law,
whether
state
or
federal,
in
this
case
state
tax
law,
and
you
try
to
reach
the
result
that
the
tribunal
that
can
speak
authoritatively
for
the
state
government
in
this
case
which
creates
the
tax
claim
would
have
reached.
what
petitioner
is
arguing
for
is
a
rule
that
would
encourage
the
reaching
of
disparate
results,
depending
on
which
tribunal
is
making
the
determination,
a
return
to
a
pre-erie
kind
of
administration
of
the
law,
which
would
destroy
congruity
in
the
achievement
of
results
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
just...
i'm
talking
about
the
spirit
of
erie.
erie
revolutionized
our
thinking
about
how
tribunals
should
go
about
making
determinations
when
they're
really
determining
something
that
is
law
emanating
from
another
jurisdiction.
they
should
try
to
achieve
the
determination
that
that
jurisdiction
would
have
achieved
through
its
normal
processes.
it's
just
an
analogy
that
i'm
drawing.
i'm
not
saying
that
erie
controls
this
case.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
construe
the
bankruptcy
code
to
encourage
disparate
results,
depending
on
which
tribunal
has
made
the
determination,
when
congress
quite
explicitly
said
that
if
it
has
gone
to
determination
before
the
normal
tax
tribunals
which
apply
the
normal
burden
of
persuasion
in
tax
cases,
that
will
be
binding
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
there
should
be
some
reason
before
we
should
read
the
companion
provision,
which
says
nothing
about
burden
of
persuasion,
to
encourage
the
bankruptcy
court,
when
it
has
to
step
in
as
the
surrogate
for
the
normal
tax
tribunals,
to
reach
different
results
by
applying
different
ways
of
determining
the
tax
liability.
in
fact,
occasionally
bankruptcy
courts,
when
there's
a
particularly
complicated
tax
question,
will
lift
the
automatic
stay,
as
they're
authorized
to
do
to
enable
a
tax
court
proceeding
to
go
ahead
to
a
conclusion
because
they
feel
that
the
tax
court
can
make
a
more
accurate
determination
on
a
complex
tax
issue,
and
then
under
this
provision
that
will
be
the
binding
determination
for
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
so
what's
really
being
advocated
here
is
an
incongruity
in
reaching
results
with
respect
to
tax
claims,
because
they
often
come
before
the
court
with
a
preexisting,
embodied
preexisting
judgment
which
congress
has
taken
no
chances
on
here,
but
has
said
will
be
binding,
and
it's
barred
the
bankruptcy
court
from
making
any
other
determination
with
respect
to
the
tax
liability.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
as
very
strong
evidence
of
the
claim
and
it's
often
argued
that
they're
res
judicata,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
code
about
other
kinds
of
judgments.
the
code...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
congress
explicitly
said
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
bound
by
tax
judgments
and
is
not
to
redetermine
those
does
seem
to,
it
seems
to
me
indicate
both
a
comfort
with
having
tax
claims
decided
under
the
ordinary
burden
of
persuasion
for
their
decision
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
they
should
not
be
bound
by
other
kinds
of
judgments.
we're
looking
for
what
congress
might
have
intended
here,
and
the
fact
that
there
was
this
explicit
provision
is
of
some
importance,
and
there
would
be
some
question
whether,
if
there
were
actually
a
different
burden
of
persuasion,
ordinary
principles
of
res
judicata
would
carry
over,
and
yet
explicitly
the
bankruptcy
court
is
not
to
redetermine
a
question
of
tax
liability
that's
embodied
in
a
judgment,
so
there's
corroboration
on
the
face.
