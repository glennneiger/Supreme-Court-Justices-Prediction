mr.
radasevich,
what
was
the
head
count
of
cases
on
your
side
versus
those
on
the
other
side
under
the
previous
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
the
other
creditors
have
to
prove
their
claims.
that's
purely
accidental.
i
suppose
you
could
have
another
state
law
that
gave
some
creditors
other
than
the
taxing
authority
the
same
kind
of
benefit
that
you're
fighting
here.
in
other
words,
suppose
there
is
a
state
law
that
does
not
require
another
creditor
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
you
would
likewise
disallow
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
other?
i
was
trying
to
think
of
one
to
give
you
a
hypothetical,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
is
a
due
process
clause
that
seems
to
stand
in
the
way
of
that,
except
for
taxing
authorities,
for
some
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
trustee
here
is
asking
to
single
out
for
some
discriminatory
treatment
one
particular
class
of
creditors.
the
fact
is,
this
is
the
only
class
of
creditors
i
know
of
that
doesn't
have
to
prove
its
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
black
lung
cases,
maybe
that's
another,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
argument
being
made
is,
this
is
a
very
strange
provision
that
does
not
exist
in
the
common
law
normally
and
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
enable
the
government,
which
normally
does
not
have
in
its
control
the
documents
necessary
to
prove
its
case,
to
collect
taxes
that
are
due,
and
that
when
you
shift
over
into
a
bankruptcy
context
the
situation
changes.
it's
not
the
government...
the
other
creditors
are
no
more
in
control
of
the
necessary
documents
than
the
government
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
playing
word
games.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
had
to
prove
it
the
way
the
state
law
said
you
had
to
prove
it,
which
is
not
the
way
everybody
else
has
to
prove
it,
that
is,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
a
distinctive
burden
of
proof
that
has
been
singled
out
for
tax
claims,
and
the
argument
being
made
is,
there
are
good
reasons
for
that,
but
those
reasons
don't
apply
in
bankruptcy,
and
therefore
this
particular
very
weird
element
of,
you
don't
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
proving
your
claim,
should
not
be
carried
over
into
bankruptcy
law,
and
there
were
many
courts
that
came
out
that
way
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act,
and
collier
on
bankruptcy,
the
only
bankruptcy
authority
i
ever
used,
agreed
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
you
do
both?
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
different
burden
of
proof,
i
mean,
res
judicata
in
a
civil
case
doesn't
cover
in
a
criminal
case
because
they're
different
burdens.
i'm
not
sure
you
couldn't
bring
the
second
action
even--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
lost
the
bankruptcy
action
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
don't
hypothesize
the
worst.
be
optimistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
a
special
preference
outside
of
bankruptcy.
i
mean,
it
is
weird.
i
don't
know
that
the
states
could
do
what
justice
breyer
suggested
and
simply
in
other
fields,
other
than
taxation,
where
we've
allowed
this.
it
is
due
process
in
taxation
to
put
the
burden
on
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
he
doesn't
owe
the
tax.
i
seriously
doubt
whether
it
would
be
due
process
in
other
instances
to
say
that
this
plaintiff
wins
unless
the
defendant
can
prove
that
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
a
cause
of
action.
i
think
that's
very
problematic.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
reason
you
have
this
special
preference
has
nothing
to
do
with
what's
up
in
the
bankruptcy
case,
and
the
equities
are
so
much
different.
you're
not
going
after
the
taxpayer.
you're
going
after
his
money.
you're
going
after
the
widows
and
orphans,
to
put
it
tendentiously.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
that's
an
incongruity.
it
seems
to
me
quite
congress
to
say
judgments
are
judgments.
are
not
other
judgments
accepted
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they'd
be
bound
by
other
sorts
of
judgments
on
some
issues
which,
if
the...
if
there
had
not
been
a
judgment,
and
the
issue
were
presented
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
bankruptcy
court
might
well
determine
that
issue
differently
from
the
way
the
state
court...
i
mean,
let's
assume
it
wasn't
an
issue
of
burden
of
persuasion,
but
an
issue
of,
i
don't
know,
something
that
the
forum
decides.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
bankruptcy
court,
judge
posner...
or
the
bankruptcy
court
could
have
lifted
the
stay
and
allowed
that
circuit
court
proceeding
to
go
forward?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
the
burden
would
have
been
the
burden
that
you
don't
like?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
whether
you're
going
to
have
the
burden
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
