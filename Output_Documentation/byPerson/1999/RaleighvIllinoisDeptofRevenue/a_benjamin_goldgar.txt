mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
clearing
up
one
area
of
potential
confusion,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
difference
between,
if
there
is
a
difference
between
the
validity
of
a
claim
and
the
allowance
of
a
claim.
mr.
radasevich
said
that
validity
is
not
the
same
as
allowance.
that
is
both
true
and
untrue.
allowance
can
mean
more
than
validity,
certainly.
there
are
reasons
under
section
502
of
the
code
for
disallowing
a
claim
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
validity,
but
validity
is
itself
a
reason
for
disallowing
a
claim.
it
was,
in
fact,
the
reason
why
the
trustee
in
this
case
challenged
the
claim.
it
was
the
trustee's
assertion
that
the
department
of
revenue's
claim
was
not
valid
under
state
law.
under
illinois
tax
law,
he
contended,
we
did
not
have
a
claim.
in
that
instance,
validity
is
indeed
the
same
as
allowance.
now,
to
make
matters
more
complicated
and
talk
about
how
allowance
is
used
in
the
vanston
case,
under
the
act,
as
opposed
to
under
the
code,
allowance
meant
something
else
again.
it
not
only
meant
allowance
in
the
sense
that
it's
used
in
section
502,
but
it
also
incorporated
notions
of
equitable
subordination,
so
that
the
vanston
case...
and
i
can't
speak
to
why
it
wasn't
cited
in
the
butner
decision,
but
it
was
cited
in
the
opinion
that
justice
stevens
wrote
in
grogan
v.
garner.
in
vanston,
the
court
first
observed
that
the
validity
of
a
claim...
i
believe
they
termed
it
existence,
but
that's
really
the
same
thing.
the
existence
of
a
claim
is
a
matter
of
state
law
except
where
there
is
overruling
federal
law,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
essentially
the
equivalent
of
equitable
subordination
applied,
and
that
is
that
it
was
unfair
to
allow
these
particular
creditors
interest
on
interest
at
the
expense
of
other
creditors,
so
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
allowance.
we
are
also
talking
about
validity.
the
trustee
in
this
case
is
asking
the
court
to
do
something
that
we
contend
is
pretty
radical
and
that
is,
in
the
face
of
congressional
silence
and
ignoring
the
vital
interest
that
states
have
in
the
integrity
of
their
tax
schemes,
he's
asking
the
court
essentially
to
fashion
a
federal
common
law
burden
of
proof
only,
apparently,
for
tax
claims
and
only
in
bankruptcy.
under
his
rule,
tax
claims
would
be
decided
differently
in
bankruptcy
court
than
in
state
court.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
yes,
he
did
say
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
stand
corrected.
although
if
there
are
no
other
burdens
of
proof
that
are
similar,
we
believe
the
rule
he
is
asking
for
would
only
have
an
impact
on
tax
creditors.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
i
don't
know
of
any
myself.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
that
doesn't
mean
there
aren't
any,
but
i
couldn't
name
any
for
you
now.
under
his
rule,
essentially
what
happens
is
that
state
tax
law
is
changed,
altering
the
rights
of
really
a
single
creditor,
a
single
class
of
creditors
to
the
benefit
of
all
other
creditors
in
bankruptcy,
and
that
class
of
creditors
that
is
disadvantaged
is,
in
fact,
a
class
of
creditors
that
is
ordinarily
favored
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
yes,
that...
we
do
assume
that.
we
think
that's
an
accurate
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
well,
i
don't--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well,
let
me--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--let
me
answer
that
a
couple
of
ways.
the
first
is,
tax
creditors
do
have
to
prove
their
claims.
we
had
to
prove
our
claim
here.
we
proved
it
the
way
state
law
required
that
we
prove
it.
we
proved
it
with
the
certified
record
of
our
proceedings,
which
in
this
instance,
with
an
unavailable
taxpayer,
essentially--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--that's
the
burden
of
proof,
though,
that
attaches
to
their
claim,
whatever
it
may
be.
this
is
the
burden...
and
therefore
that's--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well,
some
courts
came
out
that
way
and
many
courts
did
not.
i
think
what
the
trustee
is
really
suggesting
here
is
that
in
bankruptcy
we
can
end
up
doing
a
kind
of
ad
hoc
balancing
and
determine
whether
we
like
or
dislike
the
substantive
law
attendant
to
a
particular
creditor's
claim
when
we're
deciding
the
validity
of
that
claim.
in
this
instance
it
apparently,
according
to
the
district
court,
was
simply
deemed
to
be
unfair
to
the
other
creditors
to
allow
tax
creditors
to
have
the
benefit
of
their
burden
of
proof.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
we
should
win
because...
well,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
because
it
is
part
of
our
claim.
it
is
part
of
the
substance
of
our
claim.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
history
or
tradition
or
reason
of
the
burden
of--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
well--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--first
of
all,
even
if...
i
don't
agree
that
that
is
the
particular
playing
field
we
should
be
on.
i
mean--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--but
i
take...
you
know,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
even
if
the
set
of
facts
that
mr.
radasevich
posits
is
true
here,
or
even
occasionally
true,
it's
certainly
not
always
going
to
be
true.
in
many
instances,
if
not
most
instances,
the
debtor-taxpayer
is
the
objecting
party
in
bankruptcy.
in
many
instances
when
the
trustee
is
the
objecting
party
the
trustee
has
the
information.
this
is
the
most
sympathetic
case
for
a
trustee.
we've
got
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy
with
insufficient
assets.
we
have
a
trustee
who's
the
bankrupt...
who
is
the
objecting
party,
and
a
trustee
who
happens
to
have
no
records,
despite
efforts
on
both
sides
to
get
them,
because
we
had
a
taxpayer
who
was
under
indictment
and
eventually
convicted
of
a
crime.
but
that
isn't
always
going
to
be
the
case.
in
most
instances
it
won't
be,
and
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
a
legal
rule,
do
we
want
bankruptcy
courts
making
what
are
essentially
ad
hoc
balancing
determinations
before
we
ever
even
get
into
the
litigation
of
the
claim.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
these
would
be
nondischargeable,
yes.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
well,
in
this
instance
the
taxpayer
who,
as
mr.
radasevich
pointed
out,
is
a
guest
of
the
federal
government,
and--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--two
points
about
that.
first,
though
nondischargeable,
if
it's
disallowed
in
the
bankruptcy,
presumably
that
would
mean
that
we
have
no
claim.
i
don't
imagine
that
we
would--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well,
in
that
event,
justice
o'connor,
the
government
is
put
to
an
impossible
choice,
because
in
that
instance
we
either
have
to
choose,
apparently,
between
making
our
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
and
suffering
a
different
burden
of
proof
than
we
would
have
if
we
made
the
claim
in
the
state
court,
or
waiting
until
the
bankruptcy
is
concluded,
in
which
case
the
assets
have
been
distributed
hither
and
yon,
and--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--i'm
not
sure
if
we
could
or
we
couldn't.
i
think
that
raises
difficult
problems,
but
let's
assume
that
we
could.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
well--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--no,
that's
true,
but
still
what
happens
is,
and
i
don't
think
this
can
really
be
denied,
the
assets
get
distributed.
the
money
is
going
to
be
distributed.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
in
this
case,
911,000
dollars,
almost
912,000
dollars.
mr.
stoecker
i
don't
believe
is
going
to
have
912,000
dollars
any
time
soon.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
it
could
be
a
very
long
wait,
and
that
at
the
same
time
that
congress
has
said
that
we
should
be
a
priority
creditor
and
instead,
if
we
have
to
wait,
then
we
actually
come
after
all
the
general
unsecured
creditors
instead
of
before
them.
that's
not
a
dilemma,
that's
not
a
choice
that
congress
has
indicated
we
should
be
put
to,
not
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
i--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--i
don't
know
of
anything
that
i
could
cite
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
no.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--sorry.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
oh,
yes,
i
would
certainly
say
that.
i
mean--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well,
i
certainly
can't
speak
to
that,
but
you
know,
perhaps
that
will
happen
one
day,
although
it
seems
unlikely,
but
we're
not
asking
for
anything
special.
that's
our
point.
we're...
we
want
what
everybody
else
gets
in
bankruptcy.
everybody
else
gets
their
substantive
rights
under
state
law
in
deciding
whether
their
claim
is
a
valid
claim
under
state
law.
that's
what
we
want.
if--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well--
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
--well,
here
the
widows
and
orphans
are
banks,
just
to
make
that--
[laughter]
so
you
know...
but
again,
what
your
honor
is
assuming
is
what
the
trustee
is
assuming,
and
that
is,
in
bankruptcy
suddenly
everything
changes
and
the
trustee
doesn't
have
the
information.
mr.
a.
benjamin
goldgar
that's
right.
we
didn't
know
about
this
taxpayer,
and
by
taxpayer
i
mean
chandler,
the
corporation.
we...
he
had...
this
corporation
was,
according
to
the
indictment,
a
shell
with
no
real
business
operations
at
all
that
was
apparently
used
for
the
purchase
of
this
plane
and
for
nothing
else,
and
there
was
no
information
available
to
us.
you
know,
what
mr.
stoecker
would
have
said
i
don't
know.
this
was
a
corporation
that
never
paid
any
taxes,
it
was
never
registered
with
the
state,
so
there
was
nothing
we
could
do,
so
in
many
respects
this
is
the
most
sympathetic
case
for
the
government.
there
was
no
evidence
available
here,
and
yet
there
was
a
sale
or
purchase,
both,
of
a
12.5
million
dollar
airplane
which
was
subject
to
illinois
use
tax
to
the
tune
of
a
million
dollars.
now,
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
us
to
prove
the
elements
of
responsible
officer
reliability
here,
these
people
succeeded
in
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
get
off
scott-free,
no
tax.
the
banks,
not
the
widows
and
orphans,
collect
their
money.
it's
important
to
remember
that
we're
still
litigating
the
debtor's
liability,
and
it's
still
the
government
on
the
other
side,
and
the
government
still
doesn't
have
the
information,
even
though
the
situation
is
in
bankruptcy.
ordinarily,
lack
of
evidence
is
called
a
failure
of
proof.
it's
not
a
reason
for
shifting
the
burden
of
proof.
in
many
respects
the
trustee
and
any
other
creditors
are
better
off
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
if
we
were
litigating
this
outside
of
bankruptcy,
well,
there
wouldn't
be
a
trustee,
of
course,
but
the
other
creditors
would
not
get
notice
of
this
claim.
we
could
go
and
sue
for
these
taxes
and
not
tell
anybody
but
the
taxpayer.
here,
they
get
notice.
here,
they
have
standing
to
come
in
and
complain
about
it.
they
get
to
reopen
an
assessment
that
was
defaulted
under
state
law
and
was
final
against
this
taxpayer,
so
they
have
many
rights.
they
have
many
rights.
at
bottom,
this
is
an
argument,
we
suggest,
for
amending
the
code.
it's
not
an
argument
for
imposing
a
common
law
burden
of
proof
in
the
face
of
total
congressional
silence
on
this
issue.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
