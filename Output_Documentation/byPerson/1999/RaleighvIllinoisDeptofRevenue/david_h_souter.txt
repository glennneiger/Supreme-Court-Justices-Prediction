justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
the
question
is,
is
whether
we
in
effect
would
be
chipping
away
at
the
concept
of
the
validity
of
the
claim
if
we
did
not
recognize
the
burden-of-persuasion
rule,
and
the
argument,
i
suppose,
that
we
would
be
chipping
away
at
it,
that
we
really
would
not
be
recognizing
validity
100
percent,
is
the
argument
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
so
important
to
the
government's
claim
that
you
really
cannot
conceive
of
the
claim
in
traditional
terms
without
conceiving
of
it
as
one
upon
which
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden.
and
the
argument
for
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
the
taxpayer
is
usually
the
one
who
has
the
most
easy
access
to
the
facts,
and
the
easiest
access
to
the
evidence
upon
which
ultimately
the
tax
liability
is
going
to
depend,
so
if
you
take
that
argument,
that
by
removing
the
burden
of
persuasion
you
really
are
taking
away
an
element
that
goes
very
importantly
to
the
validity,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
true,
but
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
gets
to
the,
really
to
the
heart
of
the
point,
that
by
adjusting,
we'll
say,
the
relations
of
fairness
as
between
the
original
parties,
the
original
taxpayer
and
the
government,
you
are
in
fact,
or
you
would
in
fact,
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
be
changing
the
nature
of
the
claim
because
you
simply
cannot
understand
the
claim
except
in
terms
of
who
has
the
burden.
if
the
government
has
the
burden,
it
doesn't
have
that
much
of
a
claim
because
it
simply
doesn't
have
access
to
the
means
of
showing
it,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
meat
of
their
argument
really
is
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
we
have
a
slight
shift
in
the
actual
parties
to
the
relationship
here.
the
meat
of
their
argument
is,
the
claim
itself
would
be
changed
if
you
changed
the
burden,
regardless
of
who
happens
to
be
fighting
about
it
at
a
given
time,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
you
really
responded
to
that.
justice
david
h.

this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
raleigh
is
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
for
william
stoecker,
the
former
president
of
chandler
enterprises
incorporated,
the
corporation
doing
business
in
the
illinois.
chandler
bought
an
airplane
out
of
state
and
failed
to
pay
the
illinois
use
tax
on
the
purchase.
when
the
state
department
of
revenue
discovered
the
omission,
it
issued
a
notice
of
liability
to
chandler
and
the
notice
of
penalty
liability
to
stoecker
as
a
responsible
corporate
officer.
by
doing
that,
the
state
in
effect
charged
stoecker
with
the
liability
for
the
corporation’s
unpaid
tax.
stoecker
however
was
by
then
in
bankruptcy.
while
illinois
law
puts
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
taxpayer
to
disprove
the
validity
of
a
penalty
liability
claim,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
argued
that
bankruptcy
should
be
governed
by
a
uniform
rule
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
creditors,
including
state
tax
authorities.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
rejected
the
trustee’s
argument,
yet
applied
illinois
law
and
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
trustee.
because
the
evidence
on
either
side
was
extremely
limited,
the
trustee
could
not
meet
the
burden
and
the
liability
was
sustained.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
affirm.
the
burden
of
proof
is
a
substantive
element
of
a
creditor’s
claim.
if
the
underlying
law
creating
a
tax
claim
puts
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
he
does
not
owe
the
tax
claimed
by
the
government,
the
burden
of
proof
remains
with
the
taxpayer
if
he
files
in
bankruptcy.
while
congress
may
alter
substantive
aspects
of
creditor’s
claims
in
bankruptcy,
there
is
no
indication
that
it
is
chosen
to
change
the
burden
of
proof
in
tax
matters.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
