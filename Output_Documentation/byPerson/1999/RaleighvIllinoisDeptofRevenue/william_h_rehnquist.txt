chief

william

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-387,
thomas
raleigh
v.
the
illinois
department
of
revenue.
mr.
radasevich.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
respondent
disputes
that,
mr.
radasevich.
he
says
there
really
wasn't...
there
was
authority
on
both
sides
and
it
simply
wasn't
well-established.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bankruptcy
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
might
argue
that
the
view
of
the
seventh
circuit
here
does
not
really
favor
taxing
authorities
in
that
sense.
it
simply
says,
we're
taking
the
substantive
law
from
state
law
in
each
case
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
is
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
that's
what
the
case
is
really
all
about,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
deny,
i
take
it,
that
that
is
a
part
of
the
state
law
of
illinois,
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
objector
here
introduce
some
sort
of
evidence
of
the
kind
you're
talking
about?
somewhere
in
these
opinions
one
of
the
courts
says
there's
virtually
no
evidence
on
the
subject
either
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
what
about
the
objector?
you
say
that
person
at
least
has
to
come
in
with
a
plausible
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
done
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
radasevich.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goldgar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
your
argument
assumes
that
the
burden
of
proof,
or
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
part
of
the
substantive
law
that
governs
the
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
some
of
the
reason
for
the
benefit
given
by
state
law
to
the
taxing
authority
illustrated
here,
where
apparently
it
took
the
state
a
number
of
years
to
learn
that
this
12
million
dollar
airplane
had
even
been
sold?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldgar.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
now...
you
have
4
minutes
remaining,
mr.
radasevich.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
defaulted
administrative
proceeding
in
the
illinois
tax
commission,
or
whatever
body
it
is
in
illinois
that
decides
those
sort
of
things?
was
this
just
a
claim
that
had
never
been
even
administratively
adjudicated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
would
have
been
a
circuit
court
challenge
to
the
administrative
adjudication?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
radasevich.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-387,
raleigh
v.
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
