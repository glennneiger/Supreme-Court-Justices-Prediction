well,
wouldn't
we
normally
look
to
state
law
for
the
substantive
law
giving
rise
to
any
claim?
i
mean,
is
that
what
we
normally
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
the
state
law
provides
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
taxpayer,
why
wouldn't
we
follow
that,
or
vice
versa?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
code...
the
act
gives
tax
claims
priority,
which
indicates
a
certain
preference,
in
a
sense,
for
paying
the
taxes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
why
you
claim
it's
an
ad
hoc
balancing.
it's
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
i
don't
see
that
that's
ad
hoc
balancing.
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
the
taxes
that
the
state
wants
presumably
are
exempt
from
any
debtor's
discharge
in
bankruptcy,
is
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
so
you
could
go
after
the
taxpayer
without
ever
making
a
claim
in
bankruptcy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
presumably
won't
always
be,
and
the
state
can
go
after
him
in
the
future.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
nondischargeable
debt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
you
never
made
a
claim
through
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
presumably
the
state
can
always
go
after
the
taxpayer.
