chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
was
not
denied
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
he
was
not
permitted
to
vote
for
office
of
hawaiian
affairs
trustees
because
he
is
not
a
beneficiary
of
the
trusts
they
administer.
that
beneficiary
group
is
singled
out
not
because
of
race,
but
because
of
its
status,
its
congressionally
recognized
status
as
the
subject
of
a
trust
relationship
with
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
it
flows
from
the
indian
affairs
power,
and
under
that
power
congress
has
the
authority
to
determine
what
groups
should
be
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
status,
for
how
long,
and
to
what
extent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
congress
has
singled
out
hawaiians
as
a
beneficiary
of
a
trust
relationship,
just
like
the
trust
relationship
that
is
extended
to
american
indians--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
hasn't
ratified
it.
it
has
recognized
it
in
recent
legislation.
it
has
referred--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--congress,
in
the
statehood
act,
delegated
to
the
state
of
hawaii
the
responsibility
for
implementing
the
trust
relationship
"in
such
manner
as
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
may
provide.
"
one
way
that
hawaii
chose
to
fulfill
that
obligation
is
by
establishing
oha,
including
this
voting
provision.
congress
has
recognized
the
existence
of
oha.
it
gives
federal
funds
to
oha
and
says
you,
oha,
represent
and
serve
the
interests
of
hawaiians.
it
is
a
native
hawaiian
organization,
and
therefore
will
get
the
federal
funds
in
implementing
the
trust
responsibility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
the
framers,
when
they
used
the
word,
indian,
meant
any
of
the
native
inhabitants
of
the
new-found
lands.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--two
points.
the
answer
is,
their
power
does,
in
fact,
extend
to
indians
who
are
not
members
of
a
tribe.
this
court
recognized
that
in
united
states
v.
john.
it
recognized
it
in
united
states
v.
mcgowan.
it
is
recognized
that
congress'
power
continues,
for
example,
when
tribal
status
has
been
terminated,
continues
beyond
that,
and
in
fact
the
ira,
the
indian
reorganization
act
definition
of
an
indian
includes
indians
who
are
not
members
of
any
tribe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
congress
is...
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
question
contains,
it
seems,
an
objection
to
indian
law
jurisprudence,
and
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is,
does
it
extend
to
the
native
americans
who
happen
to
live
on
the
islands
of
hawaii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
is
what
tribes
meant
in
the
constitution,
and
tribes
at
the
time
of
the
framing
was
defined
as
a
distinct
body
of
people
divided
by
family
or
fortune
or
any
other
characteristic.
that's
a
dictionary
quotation.
now,
hawaiians,
as
singled
out
by
congress,
certainly
satisfy
that
definition.
the
framers--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mancari
referred
to
federally
recognized
tribes
because
that's
the
way
the
preference
was
written
in
that
case,
but
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's
not
a
level
of
generality.
the
power
rests
with
congress,
not
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
that
gives
the
stamp
of
approval
and
says,
this
is
a
tribe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
my
point
is
that
it
referred
to
federally
recognized
tribes
simply
because
that's
the
way
the
preference
was
written,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
objection
that
it's
a
race-based
preference.
the
preference
also
only
applied
to
one
quarter
indian
blood
beneficiaries,
so
it
wasn't
simply
tribal
status.
it's
no
answer
to
say,
we
were
dealing
with
a
tribe
so
race
was
off
the
table.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
qualify
for
the
benefit,
and
the
reason
it
was
not
race-based
was
because...
not
because
of
tribal
status
per
se,
but
because
the
tribe
was
the
proper
subject
of
congress'
exercise
of
its
indian
affairs
power,
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
that
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question
whether
they
can
be
treated
under
mancari
is
whether
they
can
qualify
under
the
constitution
as
an
object
of
congress'
indian
affairs
power,
and
this
court
has
seen
this
case
before.
it
is
a
replay
of
sandoval.
in
sandoval,
the
question
was
the
pueblo
indians.
the
court
had
previously
said
they're
not
indian
tribes,
united
states
v.
joseph,
so
when
congress
tried
to
treat
with
them
under
its
indian
affairs
power
in
the
admission
act
for
new
mexico,
the
objection
was
raised,
you
can't.
you
said
they're
not
indian
tribes.
and
what
this
court
said
is,
when
congress
deals
with
a
native
group
under
its
indian
affairs
power,
it's
for
congress
to
decide
that
it
will
do
so,
and
that
determination
is
"authorized
and
controlling"
so
long
as
it's
not
arbitrary.
that's
the
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
raises
a
question
on
the
application
of
mancari.
it
would
not
be
race-based,
but
mancari
says
more
than
that.
it
says
that
the
classification
has
to
be
rationally
related
to
the
fulfillment
of
congress'
obligation
toward
the
indians,
and
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
wasn't
the...
that's
not
the
obligation
at
issue
here,
nor
was
it
the
obligation
in
mancari.
it
was
to
promote
self-governance,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
oha
electoral
provision
does.
it
promotes
the
governance
of
the
beneficiaries
in
the
running
of
the
trust,
and
makes
the
trust
more
responsive,
exactly
the
same
as
in
mancari.
in
the
casino
hypothetical
it's
quite
different.
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
say
you
meet
mancari
so
long
as
you're
doing
something
good
for
the
indians.
mancari
is
a
much
more
focused
inquiry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
there
you
would
bump
up
against
the
constitutional
limitation
to
indian
tribes.
by
indians
the
framers
meant
the
native
inhabitants.
out
obligations
extend
to,
for
example,
the
alaska
natives,
not
the
russians
who
were
there
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
traced
from
chief
justice
marshall's
opinions
in
cases
like
worcester
v.
georgia
and
johnson
v.
m'intosh,
where
he
recognized
the
basic
distinction
between
the
aboriginal
indigenous
people
and
the
european
newcomers,
and
that,
by
the
way,
is
the
only
purpose
served
by
the
1778
date.
that's
the
line
that
it's
drawing,
is
between
the
aboriginals
and
the
newcomers,
a
distinction
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
not
only
in
the
constitution,
in
the
commerce
with
indian
tribes,
it's
in
the
civil
war
amendments,
the
passage
your
honor
quoted
previously.
the
idea
that
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
congress
has
determined--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
congress
has
determined
that
it
can
treat
with
hawaiians
as
it
treats
with
indian
tribes.
this
court
can
review
that
determination
under
sandoval
only
to
determine
that
it's
arbitrary,
and
congress
has
said
why
it
is
treating
native
hawaiians
in
the
same
way
as
it
treats
indian
tribes
in
these
recent
legislations...
legislation.
it
has
said,
because
we
find
them
to
be
a
distinct
and
unique
indigenous
group.
we
find--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
passage
i
was
just
referring
to
is
a
much
more
recent
1988
legislation
10
years
later,
but
congress
has
treated
with
native
hawaiians
consistently
since--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
the
federal
government
did
at
statehood
was
delegate
to
the
state
of
hawaii
the
responsibility
for
implementing
the
federal
trust
relationship.
it
took
the
1920
2000
acres
and
said,
we're
giving
it
to
you,
but
you've
got
to
implement--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it
did
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
this
court's
decision
in
yakima,
where
a
state
law
is
implemented
pursuant
to,
flows
from,
is
based
on
federal
classification
under
the
indian
affairs
power,
it's
examined
under
mancari
just
like
a
federal
legislation
would
be.
this
piece
of
legislation,
the
voting
provision,
was
enacted
by
hawaii
to
implement
the
responsibility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
in
itself
would
violate
anything.
the
question,
though...
and
the
united
states
has
retained
the
power
to
sue
the
state
if
it
breaches
the
trust.
the
question
would
be
what
the
trustees
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
interfere--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
know
that
it
would
breach
the
trust,
but
it
would
make
implementation
of
it
more
difficult,
for
this
reason.
we've
heard,
for
example,
the
objection
that
the
hawaiians
don't
have
a
sovereign
government
any
more,
but
oha
serves
many
of
those
same
functions,
and
congress
has
found
this.
it
says,
oha
serves
and
represents
native
hawaiians,
and
if
it
were
open
to
everyone,
it
could
no
longer
serve
that
function,
which
it
seems--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it's
not
an
independent
sovereignty.
i
didn't
mean
to
go
that
far.
but
it
does
serve
many
of
the
functions
of
representing
the
native
group
to
whom
this
trust
relationship
has
been
extended,
and
it
will--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--by
hawaiians,
you
mean
the
group
that
can
trace
at
least
one
ancestor
to
1778?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes
that's
true.
it
operates
two
separate
trusts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there's
some
confusion--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there's
some
confusion
because
the
federal
statutes
use
the
phrase,
native
hawaiians
to
refer
to
all
covered
by
the
trust
relationship
with
one
ancestor,
and
the
distinction
is
in
the
hawaiian
legislation.
oha
manages
two
separate
trusts,
one
for
the
benefit
of
the
50
percent
category
that
was
a
qualification
imposed
on
it
by
federal
law,
and
the
other
for
all
indigenous
hawaiians.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
congress
has
changed
the
definition
of
the
group
to
whom
it's
extended
this
trust
relationship.
it
no
longer
limits
it
to
those
with
a
50-percent
blood
quantum,
it
says,
and
has,
since
1974.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
because
congress
since
before
oha
in
1974,
defined
the
group
that
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust
relationship
to
include
those
who
can
trace
one
ancestor
back.
that's
not
unusual,
by
the
way.
there
are
indian
tribes
who
do--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
does
not
have
any
general
governmental
responsibilities.
yes,
it
funds
programs
for
its
beneficiaries
in
areas
like
housing
and
education,
but
it
has
no
general
governmental
responsibilities
in
those
areas
at
all.
its
mission
is
limited
to
hawaiians.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it's
done
it
frequently.
public
law
280
is
the
clearest
example.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
could
have,
but
it
has
frequently
delegated
lesser
responsibilities.
public
law
280,
the
criminal
law
area,
is
the
example
the
court's
probably
most
familiar
with.
it
allows
states
to
apply
their
criminal
laws
on
areas
where,
without
the
delegation,
the
states
could
not
do
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
situation
in
hawaii
is
unique,
and
under
our
federal
system,
it's
open
to
congress
to
say
that
we're
going
to
work
with
the
state
to
implement
this
responsibility.
it
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
of
all
the
states
hawaii
would
be
the
example
where
that
would
take
place,
because
of
the
different
history.
alaska,
there's
a
different
situation
with
respect
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i...
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
public
law
280
is
a
delegation
of
responsibility
to
enforce
those
criminal
laws,
because
the
state
would
be
without
power
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
the
delegation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
oha
it
doesn't
draw
up
special
laws.
it
administers
the
existing
trust.
it
is
unusual,
justice
scalia,
to
have
that
delegation,
but
look
what
the
federal
government
did.
it
took
the
200,000
acres
of
land
that
it
had
under
the
1920
act
and
gave
it
to
the
state.
that's
unusual,
too,
and
if
you're
going
to
be
giving
the
corpus
the
land,
it
seems
perfectly
natural
to
say,
you
are
going
to
have
responsibilities
in
administering
this
land
for
the
trust.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question
would
be,
under
mancari,
whether
it's
rationally
related
to
fulfilling
congress'
trust
obligation,
and
if
the
state
strays
from
that,
it
can
be
brought
back
to
that
standard.
it's
not
free
rein.
it
is
still
congress'
responsibility,
and
our
federal
system
allows
congress
to
say,
in
this
unusual
situation,
where
you
have
a
unique
history,
while
in
other
places
we
say
to
the
states,
hands
off
the
indian
lands,
here
we
give
some
of
the
lands
that
we've
held
in
trust
and
say
to
the
state,
help
us
administer
it.
in
alaska,
they
set
up
corporations
under
state
law,
and
that's
again
a
different
situation,
a
different
approach.
our
federal
system
is
flexible
enough
to
accommodate
approaches
that
are
sensitive
to
the
different--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
the
oha
voting
provision
implements
the
federal
classification
based
on
native
status,
it's
not
race-based,
and
therefore
doesn't
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
thank
you.
