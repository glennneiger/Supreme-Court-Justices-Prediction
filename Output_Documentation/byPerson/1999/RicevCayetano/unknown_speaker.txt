unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
i
just
want
to
make
one
question.
is
it
not
correct
that
your
case
would
be
precisely
the
same
if
your
plaintiff
were
any
one
of
thousands
of
other
voters?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
a
clear,
simple
way
to
resolve
this
case
in
your
favor
be
to
say
that
the
mechanism
here
is
just
an
overreading
of
salyer
and
james
v.
ball,
and
that
it
denies
one
person
one
vote?
this
is
a
general
agency
which
is
involved
in
housing,
health,
education,
taking
general
appropriations,
and
so
it
just
denies
one
person,
one
vote.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
were
to
say
it
denies
one
person
one
vote
under
reynolds
v.
sims,
that
would
give
you
the
relief
you
seek.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
was
in
the
case
earlier
and
withdrawn.
would
you
explain
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
on
the
racial
discrimination
point,
supposing
there
is
a
citizen
of
hawaii
who
has
the
same
racial
makeup
as
the
native
hawaiian,
he
came,
however,
from
tahiti
or
some
place
else,
and
is
a
citizen
of
the
state,
has
exactly
the
same
race
as
the
others,
but
he's
denied
the
vote.
would
he
be
denied
the
vote
on
account
of
race?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he's
of
the
same
race
as
those
who
were
allowed
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
even
if
the
tahitian
is
of
the
same
race,
i
mean,
the
fact
that
you
give
special
privileges
to
some
people
of
one
race,
though
not
to
all
people
of
that
race,
would
not
make
it
any
better,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
the
thing
is,
unless
you're
of
that
race,
you
can't
qualify.
unknown
speaker
not
everybody
of
that
race
may
qualify.
unknown
speaker
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
treats
age
identically
to
race
in
the
fifteenth
amendment,
doesn't
it?
the
words
are
the
same,
but
age
instead
of
race,
so
is
it
unconstitutional...
i'm
sure
it
isn't.
i
would
think
it
wasn't...
to
say
that
every
18-year-old
in
the
neighborhood
has
to
vote
for
the
director
of
the
neighborhood
senior
services
center?
i
mean,
sometimes
you
make
discriminations,
don't
you?
i'm
going
back
to
the
point
that
they're
not
being
treated
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
because
they're
beneficiaries
of
a
trust.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
is
it
your
opinion
you
do
have
to
let
every
18-year-old
in
the
neighborhood
vote
for
the
board
of
the
senior
services
center?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
once
you're
down
that
road,
once
you're
down
that
road,
then
i
get
to
where
justice
kennedy
began.
i'm
not
certain
what
i'm
supposed
to
assume
about
the
characteristics
of
this
"trust".
if
it's
really
just
like
a
trust,
i
don't
see
why
you
can't
say
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust,
and
only
they,
will
vote
for
the
trustees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
isn't
the
salyer
case
and
the
ball
v.
james
case
a
useful
tool
for
analyzing
that
very
thing?
i
mean,
is
this
a
special
use
district,
or
is
it
really
more
like
a
general
governmental
agency?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
mancari
deserves
some
comment,
where
special
provisions
and
preferences
were
provided
for
native
americans.
is
it
the
case
that
mancari
indicates
that
some
preference
can
be
given
to
native
americans,
at
least,
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
the
congress
and/or
the
state
could
treat
hawaiians
as
it
treats
native
americans--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
indian
commerce
clause?
is
that
possible?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view,
mr.
olson...
i
understand
your
point
about
mancari
involving
tribes...
that
if
you
had
the
same
case
as
mancari,
but
they
included
within
the
preferred
group
some
people
who
are
not
members
of
a
tribe,
would
that
have
compelled
a
different
result,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
the
only
change
in...
it's
actually
exactly
the
same,
except
that
the
preferred
group
is
defined
to
include
some
native
americans
who
are
not
tribal
members.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
is
your
view--
unknown
speaker
--that
if
those
were
the
facts,
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
so
then--
--you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
provide
that
casinos
that
are
otherwise
impermissible
in
certain
states
can
be
conducted
by
indians
who
are
not
members
of
tribes?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
passed
a
law
that
said--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand
that,
but
we're
talking
about--
unknown
speaker
--discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
some
that
allow
tribes
to
run
casinos.
unknown
speaker
if
that
kind
of
legislation
were
expanded
to
allow
any
group
of
american
indians
to,
whether
they're
tribal
or
not
to
run
a
casino
but
nobody
else.
unknown
speaker
the
question's
very
easy.
unknown
speaker
the
special
permission
is
not
given
to
indian
tribes.
it's
given
to
indians.
any
indian
can
run
a
casino.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
had
alaska
natives,
the
result
would
have
to
be
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
have
been
in
the
act
of
admission
or
in
the
statutes,
but
constitutionally,
as
i
understand
your
answer
both
to
justice
scalia
and
justice
stevens,
constitutionally
the
answer
would
have
to
be
different.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they--
unknown
speaker
--my
question
is
assuming
that
they
were
not
organized
on
the
same
tribal
scheme,
the
tribal
sovereignty
scheme
that
the
indians
of
the
lower
48
states
were,
so
the
result
would
have
to
be
different.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
one
part
of
it
i
don't
understand.
hawaii
wasn't
organized
into
many
tribes,
but
it
did...
it
was
a
kingdom.
it
was
a
sovereign
kingdom,
with
its
language
and
culture,
and
even
cuisine,
and
the
united
states
had
a
large
hand
in
destroying
that
sovereignty,
and
indeed
congress
passed
this
remorse
resolution
recognizing
that
the
united
states
was
in
large
measure
responsible
for
the
destruction
of
the
sovereignty
of
these
people.
so
if
the
idea
of
tribal
sovereignty,
restoring
some
of
the
dignity
that
was
lost
as
a
result
of
what
this
nation
did,
works
for
native
americans,
i
don't
understand
why
it
doesn't
also
work
for
people
who
were
a
sovereign
nation,
who
were
stripped
of
their
sovereignty,
whose
land
was
taken
without
their
consent
and
without
any
compensation.
the
analogy
seems
to
me
quite
strong.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you're
contradicting
the
congressional
resolution
that
said
we
were
guilty?
do
we
have
to
accept
that...
does...
that
resolution
as
an
accurate
description
of
history?
unknown
speaker
can't
congress
make
history?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
theory
is
that
about
85
percent
of
the
population
of
hawaii
are
the
victims
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that
80
percent
are
the
victims
of
the
discrimination
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
if...
assume...
it
didn't
happen,
but
assume
that
in
1790
the
united
states
discovered
hawaii,
cook
discovered
hawaii.
could
the
congress
then
have
treated
with
the
hawaiians
under
the
treaty,
or
the
commerce
laws?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
before
1810,
before
kamehameha.
unknown
speaker
so
the
united
states
is
simply
powerful?
unknown
speaker
powerless.
it
comes
into
this
island
in
1790,
it
can't
recognize
these
people?
unknown
speaker
but...
no.
what
i'm
trying
to
probe
is
the
status
of
these
people,
and
so
i'm
putting
a
hypothetical
case
of
1790,
before
kamehameha.
from
what
you
indicated,
it
seems
to
me
congress
would
have
no
power
under
the
commerce
clause
or
the
treaty
clause
to
deal
with
these
people.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
entity.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
a
question
that
justice
kennedy's
question
prompted.
supposing
today
we
approach
an
island
that
we
had
previously
not
any
political
relationship
with,
but
it's
populated
by
a
group
of
1,000
people
who
are
just
all
farmers.
they
don't
even
have
a
government.
could
we
make
an
arrangement
with
that
group
that
you
can
become
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
in
exchange
we
give
all
of
you
and
your
descendants
a
tax
exemption,
say,
or
free
baseball
tickets
to
the
world
series.
[laughter]
some
preference.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think--
unknown
speaker
--congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
make
that
kind
of
a
deal.
unknown
speaker
right,
i'm
saying,
we'll
give
this
to
you
and
all
of
your
descendants.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
make
my
hypothetical
saying,
and
your
descendants
can
vote
when
they're
only
15
years
old.
that
would
be
the
vote.
unknown
speaker
to
get
voting
into
it,
i'd
say
we
give
you,
a)
a
tax
exemption,
and
b)
the
right
to
have
your
children
vote
when
they're
14
years
old,
and
all
your
descendants.
we
could
not
make
that--
unknown
speaker
--in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
and
my
hypothetical,
would
the
united
states
have
power
to
pass
legislation
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment,
and
to
make
agreements
with
those
people?
unknown
speaker
the
united
states
is
simply
powerless.
that's
a--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
foreign
affairs
power?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
hypothetical
is,
can
they
deal
with
them
at
all?
does
the
united
states
have
power
to
deal
with
a
people
that
is
not
organized?
unknown
speaker
the
government
can
annex
territory.
that
was
the
louisiana
purchase.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
olson.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
just
a
minute.
what
is
the
significance
of
it
being
a
congressionally
recognized
status?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think...
and
what
did
congress
do?
unknown
speaker
did
congress
ratify
this
particular
statute
that's
being
challenged
here?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean,
mr.
roberts,
to
say
congress
has
recognized
a
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
all
done
under
congress'
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
indian,
it
says
indian
tribes.
indian
tribes.
it
says
indian
tribes.
did
congress
have
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
native
americans
who
now
are
no
longer
living
on
reservations--
unknown
speaker
--and
say,
you
know,
we
have
the
exclusive
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
native
americans,
whether
they're
on
reservations
or
not?
unknown
speaker
they
remain
wards
of
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states--
unknown
speaker
--is
the
great
white
father
perpetually.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
whether
its
source
is
the
tribal
character
of
the
indians.
that's
the
question.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
only
provision
in
the
constitution
i
know
of
that
refers
not
to
indian
tribes
but
to
indians
is
the
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
altering
the
way
you
count
citizens
in
order
to
decide
how
many
votes
a
state
has,
and
it
says
representatives
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers,
counting
the
whole
number
of
persons
in
each
state,
excluding
indians.
it
doesn't
mention
tribes.
excluding
indians
not
taxed.
now,
it's
pretty
clear
what
indians
not
taxed
meant.
it
meant
indians
who
were
not
in
the
tribes,
and
if...
i'm
quoting
here
from
cohen's
handbook
of
federal
indian
law,
a
standard
source.
only
those
few
indians
who
had
severed
their
tribal
relations
and
individually
joined
non-indian
communities
were
considered
to
be
subject
to
ordinary
laws
in
a
manner
that
made
it
appropriate
to
count
them
in
the
apportionment
of
direct
federal
taxes,
or
for
representation
in
congress.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
a
clear
tradition
of
treating
indian
tribes
differently
from
indians
who
had
abandoned
their
tribal
status.
unknown
speaker
but
mancari
was
more
restrictive
than
that,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
we
said
in
mancari
was
more
restrictive
than
that,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
emphasized
the
organizational
or
organized
character
of
the
tribes,
and...
which
seems
to
go
against
this
great
level
of
generality
which
you're
trying
to
import
into
it
by
reference
to
the
18th
century
definitions.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
rests
with
congress
once
we
have
identified
what
is
meant
by
indian
tribe
under
the
indian
commerce
clause,
and
mancari
seems
to
say
that,
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
that
in
fact
the
definition
is
narrower
than
you
are
arguing
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wasn't
sufficient,
but
it
was
necessary.
race
was
a
necessary
condition.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
roberts,
that
you
begin
by
saying,
now,
this
is
not
race,
it's
a
trust.
if
we
had
trust
in
oklahoma
for
people
who
could
vote
in
1910,
and
they
could
go
to
the
special
school,
everyone
knows
that
the
reason
for
that
would
be
that
they
were
white,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
almost
afraid
of
your
own
best
argument
by
telling
us
not
to
look
at
race.
of
course
it
has
to
do
with
hawaiian
ethnicity.
that's
your
whole
argument,
i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
tell
us,
oh,
don't
worry
about
it,
it's
a
trust,
that
just
diverts
our
attention
from
the
real
issue
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
my
casino
hypothetical
that
i
put
to
your
friend
would
be
the
opposite,
that
congress
could
indeed
deem
every
person
with
indian
blood
in
his
veins
to
be
a
member
of
an
indian
tribe
and
allow
those
people
and
only
those
people
to
conduct
casinos?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
obligation
would
be
the
same
one
that's
alleged
here,
that
we've
treated
their
ancestors,
you
know,
shamefully,
and
we're
making
up
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
congress
had
at
the
time
we
acquired
the
mexican
cession,
california,
new
mexico,
arizona,
had
set
up
a
special
trust
for
people
who
were
living
in
that
territory
at
that
time,
who
were
almost
entirely
spanish-speaking.
could
it
do
that?
unknown
speaker
okay,
now
what
does...
how
do
you
define
native
inhabitants?
why
weren't
the
spanish-speaking
people
in
new
mexico
native
inhabitants?
unknown
speaker
oh,
we
do
have
a
racial
distinction
embedded
in
the
constitution
between
aboriginals
and
european
newcomers?
that's
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
related
to
tribes.
that
was
my
whole
point
previously,
that
the
exception
made
in
that
reservation
was
not
for
indians.
unknown
speaker
it
was
for
indian
tribes.
unknown
speaker
was
that
contemporaneous
with
the
recognition
of
the
oha?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
we
have
to
look
at
what
hawaii
has
done,
not
what
congress
has
done?
i
thought
we
were
looking
at
a
hawaiian
state
statute
setting
up
a
voting
scheme,
and
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
that,
if
we
could.
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
say
you're
exempt
from
the
fifteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
it
can't.
unknown
speaker
so
the
question
is,
does
this
statute
comply
with
the
fifteenth
amendment?
does
this
state
statute
comply?
unknown
speaker
could
we
talk
about
that?
unknown
speaker
would
it
violate
anything
congress
passed
if
hawaii
were
to
extend
the
vote
in
this
trust
arrangement
to
people
without
the
racial
qualification?
if
hawaii
opened
it
up,
as
the
petitioner
seeks,
to
other
voters,
would
it
violate
anything
that
congress
passed?
unknown
speaker
would
it
breach...
would
it
breach
the
trust
that
has
been
established
to
extend
the
vote
to--
unknown
speaker
--hawaiian
citizens?
unknown
speaker
oha
is
kind
of
an
independent
sovereignty
in
the
state
of
hawaii?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
much
more
than
that.
it
doesn't
apply
just
to
native
hawaiians.
it
applies
to
all
of...
all
hawaiians.
it
has
many...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
that
oha
dispensed
funds,
and
it
gave
services
to
hawaiians,
as
well
as
native
hawaiians.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
talking
about
the
native
hawaiians
in
the
trust,
but
the
purposes
of
oha
are
much
broader
than
that.
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
generally
governmental
in
character.
unknown
speaker
that
i
think
is
the
problem.
it
seems
to
me
from
reading
it,
am
i
right,
that
everyone
who
has
one
hawaiian
ancestor
at
least
gets
to
vote,
and
more
than
half
of
those
people
are
not
native
hawaiians.
they
just
have
a
distant
ancestor.
and
so
those
people
vote,
although
the
amount
of
money
involved
for
them
is
only
about
$17
million,
and
the
amount
of
money
involved
for
the
others
is
hundreds
of
millions.
unknown
speaker
so
might
this
be
all
right
if
it
were
just
for
the
native
hawaiians,
but
not
all
right
if
it
includes
more
than
half
the
people
who
are
really
like
everyone
in
hawaii
but
for
the
fact
that
they
can
trace
one
ancestor
back?
unknown
speaker
could
you
also
respond
to
justice
kennedy...
well,
you
ask...
i
wanted
him
to
respond
to
your
question.
we're
back
to
where
justice
o'connor
brought
us.
this
is
a
state
scheme
in
which
voting
for
a
state
entity
which
has
education,
housing,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
is
not
limited
to
one
person
one
vote.
it's
limited
to
this
broad
group
of
anyone
with
any
hawaiian
ancestor.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
assuming
that
the
treat
with
the
indians
power
of
the
federal
government
includes
indians
generally,
and
not
just
tribes.
what
basis
is
there
for
thinking
that
the
federal
government
can
delegate
that
power
to
a
state?
unknown
speaker
can
it
delegate
the
power
to
make
a
treaty?
could
it
have
delegated
the
power
to
make
a
treaty
with
indian
tribes
to
a
particular
state
and
say,
you
make
a
treaty?
unknown
speaker
but
the
state...
that's
the
state
governing
people
on
the
reservation,
at
least
its
own
citizens
there.
that's
not
a
matter
of
the
state
prescribing
what
special
rights
these
tribes
will
have
by
reason
of
their
status
as
tribes,
or
these
indians
by
reason
of
their
status
as
indians.
i
don't
know
on
what
basis
you
think
that
that
power,
if
it
is
a
congressional
power,
can
be
delegated
to
a
state.
unknown
speaker
public
law
280
isn't...
doesn't
support
you
at
all,
i
don't
think.
public
law
280
just
says
that
a
state
can
extend
its
existing
criminal
laws
that
already
apply
to
everybody
to
the
indian
reservation.
you're
saying
that
congress
can
delegate
to
a
state
the
authority
to
fashion
special
rules
for
a
particular
group
within
the
state.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they're
general
laws.
they're
not
saying
to
the
state,
you
can
draw
up
special
laws
to
govern
indian
tribes.
unknown
speaker
it's
unusual,
but
it's
not
a
delegation
of
federal
power,
and
here
you're
saying
they
left
it
to
the
state
to
decide
who
can
vote
on
the
basis
of
tribal
membership--
unknown
speaker
--or
aboriginal
membership.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
presumably
hawaii
would
not
have
the
authority
to
violate
the
first
amendment
in
structuring
the
state
laws,
and
perhaps
not
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
perhaps
not
to
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
do
i
understand
correctly,
on
your
view,
that
we
cannot
decide
this
case
without
deciding
that
in
fact
that
assumption
made
by
congress
is
correct,
and
that
the
native
hawaiians
may
be
treated
as
an
indian
tribe
within
the
meaning
of
the
commerce
clause?
am
i
right
in
assuming
that's...
underlies
everything
you're
going
to
say?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
was
this
a
land
base
for
the
hawaiians
to
live
on?
is
that
why
this
land
was
set
aside?
unknown
speaker
and
only
native
hawaiians
as
defined
in
this
legislation
live
on
that
land?
unknown
speaker
can
live
on
that
land.
unknown
speaker
where
are
those
lands?
are
they
on
all
of
the
islands?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
leased
only
to
native
hawaiians?
unknown
speaker
like
hotels?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
just
for
hawaiians
to
reside
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
saying
this
is
run
like
an
indian
reservation.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
governing
council.
there's
just...
it's
just--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
we
extend
that
to
people
10
generations
later,
who
had
10
generations
ago
one
indian
ancestor?
i
mean,
that
might
apply
to
everybody
in
the
room.
we
have
no
idea.
unknown
speaker
someone
where
there's
no
tribal
organization,
and
there
is
no
people
living
on
the
land,
and
you
just
have
one
ancestor
10
generations
ago--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
a
lot
of
groups
in
this
country
like
that.
there
are
a
lot
of
groups
in
this
country
like
that.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
say
that
when
you
add
to
that
one
more
factor,
namely
that
they
were
there
when...
first,
that
you
can
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
with
respect
to
those
groups,
but
not
the
other
groups
who
have
their
own
continuity,
their
own
history,
perhaps
have
been
aggrieved,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
a
manifestation
of...
it's
the
source
of
congress'--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
sole
source?
unknown
speaker
did
this
suggest
that
had
there
been
this
case,
sandoval,
or
these
other
things,
suggest
that
had
there
been
no
indian
commerce
clause,
congress
still
would
have
had
plenary
authority
to
deal
with
indian
tribes?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
my
casino
hypothetical
is
that
you
could
say
only
indians
can
run
casinos.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
i
mean,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--that
sounds
nice,
but
i
don't
know
why
that
would
have
any
constitutional
significance.
if
you
can
give
them
preferences,
you
can
give
them
preferences.
unknown
speaker
it
has
been,
but
what
in
the
constitution
requires
it?
if
you're
entitled
to
favor
this
group
as,
you
know,
subject
to
a
trust
responsibility
of
yours,
why
would
it
be
limited
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kneedler,
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
discussion,
but
i'm
not
sure
quite
how
it
answers
the
question
before
us
dealing
with
what
hawaii
can
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
now
this...
the
funds
administered,
as
i
understand
it,
also
include
tax
dollars
appropriated
by
the
hawaii
legislature.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
just
federal
money.
i
mean,
hawaii
as
a
state
has
set
up
this
scheme,
and
if
the
scheme
were
to
permit
voting
by
others,
does
that
violate
anything
congress
has
set
out?
unknown
speaker
and
these
hawaiians
are
not
fully
integrated
in
hawaiian
society?
i've
been
there,
and
i--
unknown
speaker
--cherokee...
i'm
talking
about
hawaiians.
do
you
say
that
that
rationale
applies
here,
that
these
people
have
not
made
the
transition,
that
they're
still,
you
know,
aboriginal
in
some
sense,
and
they're
on
their
way
to
being
fully
integrated
american
citizens,
but
they
haven't
quite
made
it.
is
that
the
theory?
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
defining
native
hawaiian
now
to
mean
any
hawaiian
and--
unknown
speaker
--so
148
will
do
it.
unknown
speaker
196.
unknown
speaker
congress
has
said
that's
a
distinct
group,
19...
if
you
have
195th
hawaiian
blood,
you're--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
this
case
is
a
kind
of
a
special,
unusual
situation
as
presented
to
us,
but
what
are
the
ramifications
of
the
position
that
you
are
arguing?
how
many
federal
statutes,
hawaii
statutes
that
recognize
the
hawaiian
natives
as
a
special
class
would
be
affected
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
position?
unknown
speaker
wait,
i
thought...
as
far
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
concerned,
are
there
a
lot
of
statutes--
unknown
speaker
--that
limit
voting?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
really
suggest
that
if
you
win
there
won't
be
a
lot
of
litigation
as
a
result
of
this.
unknown
speaker
the
native
alaskans,
also
the
same
thing.
everything
would
be
up
for
grabs.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday,
october
twelfth
at
ten
o'clock.
