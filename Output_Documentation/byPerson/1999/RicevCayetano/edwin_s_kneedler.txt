mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eligibility
criteria
in
this
case
arises
out
of
a
determination
by
congress
that
the
united
states
has
a
special
relationship
with
the
once-sovereign
indigenous
people
of
hawaii,
just--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
does,
but
it's
a
very
important
determination,
because
we
think
that
congress'
indian
affairs
power
applies
in
hawaii
to
the
indigenous
people,
but
the
nonindigenous
people
encountered
there,
just
as
it
does
in
the
other
49
states
and,
indeed,
congress'
first
action
with
respect
to
native
hawaiians
was
in
the
same
form
that
congress
has
always
taken
with
respect
to
native
americans,
wherever
they've
been
in
the
united
states,
and
that
is
to
set
aside
a
land
base
for
them.
in
1920,
not
long
after
annexation,
congress
set
aside
200,000
acres
of
land,
which
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
there
are
200,000
acres
that
are
set
aside
under
the
hawaiian
homes
commission
act,
passed
in
1920,
explicitly
pursuant
to
congress'
indian
power,
and
there
are
6,800
leases
to
native
hawaiians
on
those
lands,
and
a
waiting
list
of
30,000
more,
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--only
native
hawaiians
of
50
percent
or
more
blood
are
eligible
for
those
lands.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
important
point
about
that
is
that
that
manifests
congress'
recognition
soon
after
annexation
that
native
hawaiians
in
hawaii
constituted
a
distinct
community
and,
like
indian
groups
elsewhere,
a
distinct
community
whose
ties
to
the
land
and
the
culture
that
springs
from
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
are
scattered
on
all
the
islands,
according--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
they...
well,
there
are
some
lands
that
are
leased
to
non-natives
for
revenue
purposes,
but
the
purpose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--some
are
agricultural
leases,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
the...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's...
but
it's...
the
only
residences
there
would
be
for
native
hawaiians.
the
land
as
a
whole
is
for
the
benefit
of
native
hawaiians,
just
like
an
indian
reservation
land
might
be
leased
to
a
hotel.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
land
that
is
set
aside
isn't
for...
at
the
core
of
recognizing
the
native
hawaiian
people.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--my...
there's
nothing
magic
about
a
reservation
in
terms
of
congress'
plenary
indian
power.
congress
has
tailored
the
way
in
which
it
has
responded
to
the
native
people--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are
many
indian
tribes
in
this
country,
a
number
that
are
identified
in
title
25
of
the
united
states
code,
tribes
that
have
been
restored,
where
tribal
membership
is
defined
in
terms
of
descendancy,
lineal
descendancy
from
the
tribe
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it's
important
to
recognize
the
basis
for
what
congress
has
determined
in
this
century,
starting
with
the
indian...
or,
excuse
me,
the
hawaiian
homes
commission
act,
and
that
is
that
as
congress
said
in
the
resolution
in
1993,
the
native
people
of
hawaii,
in
hawaii
right
now,
have
an
historic
continuity
to
the
sovereign
nation
that
existed
at
the
time
of
european
contact,
and
has
continued
that,
and
not
only
that,
that
they
are
distinct
people,
and
that
they
are
determined
to
maintain
their
culture,
their
language,
and
their
ties
to
the
land,
and
pass
them
on.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
respect,
it's
not
just
one
more
factor.
it's
a
fundamental
factor,
recognized
in
the
text
of
the
constitution,
and
established
the
relationship
between
the
indigenous
people
who
were
here
and
the
nonindigenous
people
who
arrived.
this
court's
foundational
cases
on
indian
law
are
based
on
the
relationship
between
the
period
after
european
contact
and
prior
to
european
contact,
and
the
indian
commerce
clause,
which
is
a
manifestation
of
congress'
plenary
power
over
indians,
is
descriptive
of
the
fact
that
the
europeans--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
not
the
sole
source,
and
what
this
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
court...
there
are
a
variety
of
sources,
and
this
court
said
in
mancari
that
congress'
power
derives
both
explicitly
and
implicitly
from
the
constitution.
and
in
sandoval,
which
is
an
important
parallel
to
this
case,
the
court
said
that
not
only
does
congress
have
the
explicit
power
under
the
indian
commerce
clause
to
regulate
commerce
with
indian
tribes,
but
it
has
been...
there
has
been
a
long
executive
and
legislative
practice
and
long
line
of
judicial
decisions
recognizing
the
power
of
congress
to
do
what
it
did
here
to
extend
fostering
care
and
protection
to
indians,
who
are
the
descendants
of
those
once-sovereign,
completely
independent
nations,
because
of
the
responsibility
that
the
united
states
bears
for
having
eliminated
their
sovereign
government
and
their
control
over
their
land.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
perhaps,
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
this
is
a
power
that
recognizes...
that
stems
from
or
flows
from
the
fact
that
there
were
tribes,
and
the
full
powers
of
those
tribes
have
been
eroded,
but
does
not
detract
from
the
people,
that
indian
communities
remain
distinct
indian
communities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i
think
there's
an
important
difference
between
the
way
the
trust
relationship
has
been
exercised
by
congress
over
the
years,
which
is
a
bilateral
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
indian
people,
so
giving
resources
and
land
and
special
benefits
to
the
indian
people
is
quite
different
from
giving
them
preferences
in
the
outer
world,
and
that
distinction
is
rooted
in
mancari
itself,
where
the
court
said
that
case
would
be
different
if
the
employment
preference
extended
to
the
entire
civil
service,
or
the
country
at
large.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
the
trust--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
historic
relationship
has
been
a
bilateral
one,
and
the
bia
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
way
in
which
congress
has
carried
out
its
trust
relationship
over
the
years
is
instructive.
i
do
want
to
make
an
important--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
think
that
cases
such
as
the
yakima
case
indicate
that
where
a
state
is
acting
within
a
sphere
in
which
congress
has
authorized
it
to
act,
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
enact
measures
to
promote
self-determination
in
the
same
way.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
do,
but
once--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the...
hawaii
has
done
that,
but
the
important
federal
act
is
the
recognition
of
all
hawaiian
people
as
a
distinct
group.
once
that
political
recognition
by
congress
has
been
made,
then
the
states
we
think
can
do
things
that
correspond
to
that.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
point
whether...
about
individual
indians.
in
mancari
itself,
one
of
the
cases
the
court
critically
relied
upon
there
was
the
seber
decision,
which
recognized
congress'
power
with
respect
to
people
who
were
not
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe,
and
the
rationale
there
was
that
there
is
often
a
transition
period
from
tribal
status
to
a
fully
integrated
member
of
society
during
which
congress
can
exercise
its
special
protective
care.
that
goes
back
to
the
kagama
decision,
as
reiterated
in
mancari.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
variations,
just
as
there
are
among
the
cherokee
in
oklahoma.
there
are
those
who
live
on
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--congress
has
so
determined,
that
native
hawaiians
remain
a
distinct
community,
the
phrase
that
was
used
in
sandoval
itself,
and
was
used
in
worcester
v.
georgia
by
chief
justice
marshall
at
that
point,
because
they
had
distinct
lands,
they
retained
their
distinct
culture,
all
the
factors
that
the
bia
has
historically
looked--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i'm
sorry,
the
native
people
of
hawaii.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
lineal
descendancy,
which
is
a
measurement,
yes,
that
a
number--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
other
tribes
use.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
congress
said...
yes,
it
has,
as
it
has
in
a
number
of
statutes
in
title
25
after
section
700
with
respect
to
a
lot
of
restored
tribes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
