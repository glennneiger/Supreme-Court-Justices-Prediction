justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
of
hawaii
has
a
statewide
election
for
a
state
agency
known
as
the
office
of
hawaiian
affairs
or
oha.
now
the
hawaiian
constitution
limits
the
people
that
can
vote
in
that
trustee
election.
the
agency
administers
programs
designed
for
the
benefit
of
two
subclasses
of
the
hawaiian
citizenry.
the
first
and
the
smaller
subclass
comprises
native
hawaiians.
under
the
statute
in
hawaii,
you
are
a
native
hawaiian,
if
you
are
a
person
with
not
less
than
one
half
part
of
your
ancestry
traceable
to
the
races
that
inhabited
the
hawaiian
islands
prior
to
1778
--
and
this
larger
class
is
determined
by
the
statute
hawaiians
--
this
a
smaller
class
that
is
called
native
hawaiians,
and
there
is
a
larger
class
termed
by
the
statute
‘hawaiians’,
and
this
includes
native
hawaiians
who
have
one
half
ancestry,
but
extends
also
to
a
person
who
can
trace
any
part
of
their
ancestry
to
the
people
inhabiting
the
hawaiian
islands
in
1778.
the
petitioner
is
harold
rice,
and
he
is
a
citizen
of
hawaii
and
is
himself
a
hawaiian
in
a
well-accepted
sense
of
that
term,
but
he
doesn’t
have
the
requisite
ancestry,
even
for
the
larger
of
the
two
statutory
classes.
he
is
not
then
a
hawaiian
in
terms
of
the
statute,
so
he
may
not
vote
in
the
trustee
election.
and
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
rice
may
be
barred
from
the
state
election.
in
1996,
rice
applied
to
vote
in
the
election
for
the
trustees;
the
state
denied
the
application;
he
sued
and
contested
his
exclusion
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
surveying
the
history
of
the
islands
and
their
people,
the
district
court
determined
that
congress
and
the
state
of
hawaii
have
recognized
a
guardian-ward
relationship
with
the
native
hawaiians.
the
court
found
that
relationship
analogous
to
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
indian
tribes.
on
this
premise,
the
court
examined
the
voting
qualification
with
the
latitude
that
we
have
applied
to
legislation
passed
pursuant
to
congress’indian
affairs
powers.
the
district
court
upheld
the
law,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
purpose
in
the
command
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
are
set
forth
in
language
both
explicit
and
comprehensive.
the
national
government
and
the
states
may
not
violate
a
fundamental
principle.
they
may
not
deny
or
abridge
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
in
earlier
cases,
various
indirect
ways
were
used
to
confine
the
vote
to
a
single
race;
we
struck
down
those
statutes.
here,
the
voting
structure
and
its
limitation
is
neither
subtle
nor
indirect;
it
is
specific
in
granting
the
vote
to
persons
of
defined
ancestry
and
to
no
others.
ancestry
can
be
a
proxy
for
race,
and
it
is
that
proxy
here.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
history
of
the
hawaiian
islands
and
their
people
to
this
case,
the
opinion
filed
today
provides
a
rather
detailed
historical
account;
it
is
still
a
brief
summary
and
it
provides
a
history
in
encapsulated
form
from
the
first
polynesian
voyagers
through
captain
cooks
landfall
in
1778
and
up
to
the
present
day.
for
centuries,
hawaii
was
isolated
from
migration;
the
inhabitants
shared
common
physical
characteristics,
and
by
1778
they
had
a
common
culture.
the
very
object
of
the
statutory
definition
that’s
here
in
question
is
to
treat
the
early
hawaiians
as
a
distinct
people.
the
state
has
used
ancestry
as
a
racial
qualification
and
for
a
racial
purpose.
the
ancestral
inquiry
mandated
by
the
state
implicates
the
same
grave
concerns
as
a
classification
specifying
a
particular
race
by
name.
it
demeans
the
dignity
and
worth
of
a
person
to
be
judged
by
ancestry
instead
of
by
his
or
her
own
merit
and
essential
qualities.
an
inquiry
into
an
ancestral
alliance
is
not
consistent
with
respect
based
on
the
unique
personality
each
of
us
possesses,
the
respect
the
constitution
itself
secures
in
its
concern
for
persons
and
citizens.
the
ancestral
inquiry
is
forbidden
for
the
further
reason
that
the
use
of
racial
classifications
is
corruptive
of
the
whole
legal
order
that
democratic
elections
seek
to
preserve.
the
law
itself
may
not
become
the
instrument
for
generating
the
prejudice
and
hostility,
all
too
often
directed
against
persons
whose
particular
ancestry
is
disclosed
by
their
ethnic
characteristics
and
cultural
traditions.
now
the
state
has
offered
three
principal
defenses
for
its
voting
law,
and
we
reject
each
of
them.
the
state
argues
that
the
exclusion
of
non-hawaiians,
again
as
defined
by
the
statute;
that
their
exclusion
from
voting
is
permitted
under
our
cases
allowing
the
differential
treatment
of
certain
members
of
indian
tribes,
even
were
we
to
take
the
substantial
step
of
finding
authority
in
congress
delegated
to
the
state
to
treat
hawaiians
or
native
hawaiians
as
tribes,
congress
may
not
authorize
a
state
to
create
a
voting
scheme
of
this
sort.
the
elections
for
oha
trustees
are
elections
of
the
state,
not
of
the
quasi
sovereign
indian
tribe
and
the
elections,
to
which
the
fifteen
amendment
applies.
hawaii
further
contends
that
the
limited
voting
franchise
is
sustainable
under
a
series
of
cases
from
this
court,
holding
that
the
rule
of
‘one
person
one
vote’
does
not
pertain
to
special
purpose
districts
such
as
water
or
irrigation
districts.
the
compliance
with
the
‘one
person
one
vote’
rule
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
excuse
compliance
with
race
neutrality,
the
race
neutrality
command
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
hawaii’s
final
argument
is
that
the
voting
restriction
here
does
really
no
more
than
ensure
the
alignment
between
the
fiduciaries
and
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust,
but
all
citizens
regardless
of
race
have
an
interest
in
selecting
officials
who
make
policies
on
their
behalf,
even
if
those
policies
will
affect
some
groups
more
than
others.
the
culture
and
way
of
life
of
the
people
are
all
but
engulfed
by
a
history
beyond
their
own
control;
their
sense
of
loss
may
extend
down
through
the
generations
and
their
dismay
may
be
shared
by
members
of
the
larger
community.
as
the
state
of
hawaii
attempts
to
address
these
realities,
it
must
as
always,
seek
the
political
consensus
that
begins
with
a
sense
of
shared
purpose.
one
of
the
necessary
beginning
points
though
is
this
principle.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
too,
has
become
the
heritage
of
all
the
citizens
of
hawaii.
in
this
case,
the
fifteenth
amendment
invalidates
the
ancestry-based
electoral
qualification
and
the
judgment
is
reversed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
which
justice
souter
joins;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
ginsburg
joins
in
part,
and
justice
ginsburg
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
