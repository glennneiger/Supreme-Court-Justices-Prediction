mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
ballot
box
racial
discrimination,
plain
and
simple,
that
violates
the
two
bedrock
constitutional
provisions
that
commit
our
nation
to
racial
equality.
petitioner
harold
rice,
his
parents,
his
grandparents,
his
great-grandparents,
as
well
as
his
children
and
grandchildren,
were
born
in
hawaii.
his
ancestors
first
arrived
in
hawaii
in
1831.
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
and
a
citizen--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
would
be,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
fifteenth
amendment,
justice
stevens.
i
make
the
point
about
my
client's
relationship
with
the
state
of
hawaii
and
the
territory
of
hawaii
because
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
by
the
respondent
with
respect
to
the
justification
for
the
racial
classification
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but
hawaii
prohibits,
despite
the
fact
he
is
a
citizen,
mr.
rice
from
voting
in
a
state-conducted
election
for
state
officials
who
annually
distribute
millions
of
dollars
of
proceeds
from
state-owned
property
and
money
appropriated
from
hawaiian
taxpayers.
when
it
comes
time
to
vote
in
the
election
for
the
board
of
office
of
hawaiian
affairs,
it
no
longer
matters
that
mr.
rice
is
a
hawaiian
citizen
and
a
hawaiian
native.
in
that
election,
because
he
has
the
wrong
ancestors
he
is
no
longer
a
hawaiian,
and
he
may
not
vote.
the
clearest,
simplest,
and
narrowest
ground
for
deciding
this
case
may
be
found
in
the
fifteenth
amendment,
which
declares
that
no
citizen
may
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
the
right
to
vote,
this
court
has
said,
is
the
essence
of
a
democratic
society.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
that
issue
was
in
the
case
and
was
withdrawn
from
the
case.
i
do
agree
with
you
that
it
violates
that
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
think
it
is
much
easier
to
say
that
it
denies
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
this
is
a
racial
determination,
and
the
right
to
vote
is
being
denied
here.
this
court
has
been
particularly
scrupulous
about
holding
that
there
are
no
exceptions
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
evasions
and
subterfuges
such
as
grandfather
clauses,
white
primaries,
and
racial
gerrymanders--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor
on
that
grounds,
we
of
course
would
be
satisfied.
as
i
say,
it
has
been
briefed
and
argued
in
this
case
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
with
respect
to
a
racial
discrimination.
hawaii--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
can't
recall
the
circumstances,
justice
o'connor.
i
remember
reading
something
as
i
was
preparing
today
that
that
issue
was
involved
in
the
case,
but
it
was
brought
as
a
racial
discrimination
case,
and
pursued
as
a
racial
discrimination
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
he
would
be
denied
a
vote
on
account
of
race,
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
depends
upon...
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
definition
of
race
relates
to
drawing
a
line
with
respect
to
a
person's
ancestors.
this
is
what
hawaii
has
done,
and
the
reason
why
they
have
drawn
that
line,
and
they've
drawn
it
on
the
year
1778,
is
that
is
the
first
date
on
which
a
european
arrived
on
a
permanent
basis
on
the
islands.
there
is
no
question
that
what
hawaii
was
attempting
to
do
here
was
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
it
defines
the
program's
beneficiaries
in
terms
of
their
race
or
their
blood.
it
defines
the
right
to
vote
in
terms
of
aboriginal
peoples,
having
an
ancestor
with
aboriginal
peoples
that
were
there
in
1778,
and
when
that
definition
was
adopted
the
legislature
said,
make
no
mistake
about
it,
aboriginal
peoples
means
race.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
hawaii
has
issued
a
formal
legal
opinion
that
says
racial
descent
is
what
is
the
key
to
voting
in
this
election.
if
you
an
adopted
child
of
a
person,
persons
that
qualify
for
election,
because
you
do
not
have
the
right
racial
descent
you
are
not
qualified
to
vote.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
agree
completely.
that
is...
that...
racial
discrimination
doesn't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct,
and
an
interesting
example
of
that
is
loving
v.
virginia,
where
the
supreme
court
there
was
dealing
with
racial
discrimination
with
respect
to
miscegenation,
interracial
marriage.
there
was
a
particular
definition
that
allowed
certain
ancestors,
descendants
of
american
indians
to
qualify
as
white
persons
for
that
purpose
on
the
grounds
that
they
may
have
been
descendants
of
pocahontas.
it
is
a
question
of
ancestry,
which
this
court
has
repeated
over
and
over
again,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
college
of
st.
francis
involved
the
discrimination
against
an
individual
because
he
was
of
the
arabian
race.
even
though
he
may
have
looked
like
other
people
that
were
going
to
be
admitted
to
the
faculty--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
definition
ties
to
race.
the
legislature
thought
it
was
connected
with
race.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that's
a
totally
different...
no,
i
don't.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
the
land
was
put
in
trust,
and
it's
not
like
a
bank,
a
trust
in
the
concept
of
banks
and
trustees
and
beneficiaries.
it
was
a
so-called
public
trust.
the
land
is
held
by
the
state
of
hawaii
for
all
the
citizens
of
hawaii.
hawaii
has
simply
decided
arbitrarily
to
set
aside
20
percent
of
the
proceeds
of
that
property,
plus
taxpayer
revenue
on
behalf
of
people,
because
they're
descended
from
certain
people
that
lived
in
the
island
in
1778.
that
seems
to
me,
whatever
the
law
might
be
with
respect
to
18-year-olds,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
right
to
vote,
and
the
right
to
vote
and
not
being
abridged
the
right
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
race,
or
color,
or
condition
of
servitude,
is
vital
to
the
functioning
of
the
democracy.
and
this
court
has
frequently
equated...
in
fact,
the
grandfather
clauses
are
a
good
example,
where
this
hawaii
situation
is
indistinguishable,
in
a
sense,
because
it
allows
people
to
vote
if
they
have
an
ancestor
that
was
in
the
islands
in
1778
in
the
same
way
that
oklahoma
didn't
impose
a
literacy
test
if
you
had
an
ancestor
that
was
permitted
to
vote
in
1866
in
oklahoma.
this
situation
falls
squarely
within
that
limitation.
the
word
trust
is
an
arbitrary
term,
and
there
isn't
really
any...
there
aren't
any
decisions
from
this
court
that
say,
simply
because
you
call
something
a
trust,
if
the
state
of
x
decides
we
will
provide
benefits
for
people
of
certain
ancestry,
suppose
they're
descendants
of
people
who
were
in
the
state
of
texas
when
it
was
a
republic,
if
that
money
is
set
aside
from
public
funds,
and
we
will
call
it
a
trust,
and
therefore
we
will
justify
the
discrimination
in
the
voting
on
the
basis
of
the
discrimination
in
the
giving,
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
a
very
good
question,
and
the
respondent
has
relied
upon
that
case.
you
will
recall
that
that
case
involves
a
water
irrigation
district
created
by
the
landowners
in
that
area,
the
funds
for
which
came
from
the
landowners,
and
the
landowners
in
that
very
narrow,
local
irrigation
area
or
water
conservation
district
were
the
ones
that
voted
as
to
how
that
worked.
this
is
an
agency
created
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
hawaii.
it
is
called
a
state
agency
by
the
hawaiian
supreme
court.
the
officials
on
this
agency
are
public
officials
under
the
definition
of
the
law
of
hawaii.
they
give
out
money
that
belongs
to
all
of
the
citizens
of
hawaii.
they
perform
general
governmental
functions
like
education,
providing
benefits
for
economic
advantage,
health
care,
and
all
of
those
things,
the
same
sort
of
general
things
that
were
not
involved
in
salyer,
and
in
fact
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
an
earlier
case,
the
office
of
hawaiian
affairs
even
claimed
eleventh
amendment
immunity
on
the
grounds
that
they
were,
in
fact,
the
state
of
hawaii,
so
this
is...
there
really
is
no
comparison
with
the
salyer
case
on
the
merits.
in
addition,
of
course,
salyer
did
not
create
an
exemption
for
racial
discrimination.
it
was
not
a
case
involving
race.
it
was
not
a
case
involving
voting.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
this
court,
justice
o'connor,
did
in
the
mancari
case
is
make
it
very
clear
that
it
was
analyzing
the
extent
to
which
congress
had
power
under
the
constitution
to
act
with
respect
to
indian
tribes
as
quasi-sovereigns
under
the
constitution.
the
commerce
clause
provides
the
congress
with
authority
to
deal
with
indian
tribes.
the
court,
in
the
space
of
a
relatively
short
opinion,
about
six
or
seven
pages
of
opinion
focusing
on
that
particular
issue,
used
the
words
indian
tribes,
quasi-sovereign
tribes,
federally
recognized
tribes,
over
20
times
to
make
the
point
very
clearly
that...
and
to
use
the
language
or
the
words
of
the
court
in
that
case,
the
preferences
granted
to
indians,
which
was
a
hiring
preference
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
not
as
a
discrete
racial
group,
rather
as
members
of
quasi-sovereign
entities.
the
preference
relates
to
a
legitimate
nonracial
goal,
because
it
related
to
tribes,
and
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
in
the
first
place--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
because
the
unit
that
we're
talking
about,
the
collection
of
people
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
first
place
has
never
been
considered
or
perceived
of
as
a
tribe.
as
respondent--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--states...
i
just
want
to
make
that
point
if
i
may.
first,
preliminarily,
they
say
the
tribal
concept
simply
has
no
place
in
hawaiian
history,
so
we're
talking
about
the
possibility
of
extending
the
doctrine
in
a
context
in
which
there's
no--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
one
would
have
to
examine
the
context
of
the
case,
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
seemed
to
be
the
clear
import
of
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
it
seems
to
be
the
clear
import
of
the
case,
and
then
the
court...
this
court
reinforced
that
in
the
yakima
nation
case
by
saying,
the
unique
status
of
indian
tribes
under...
and
this
is
a
partial
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question...
permits
the
federal
government,
not
the
state
government,
to
enact
legislation
singling
out
indians
because
of
the
tribal
characteristic,
legislation
that
otherwise
might
be
constitutionally
offensive.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think...
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that...
of
course,
that
is
not
a
fifteenth
amendment
case.
that
would
have
to
be
examined
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and,
of
course--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
i
think
that
that
may
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
it
was
limited
to...
if
the
state
was--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--enacted
legislation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure
i'm
understanding
the
question.
is
the...
if
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
the
answer
that's
hard,
perhaps.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think...
i
think
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
congress'
power
to
operate
with
respect
to
indians,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
over
and
over
again,
derives
from
the
indian
commerce
clause
or
the
indian
treaty
clause,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
status
of
indian
tribes,
not
as
indian
people.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
are...
in
fact
there
was
a
specific
distinction
between
the
way
alaska
was
treated
and
the
way
hawaii
was
treated
when
it
was
entered
into
the
nation,
because
there
were
indian
tribes
in
alaska,
so
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
people
who
were
not
members
of
tribes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
answer
would
be
the
same
to
the
extent
that
the
people
in
alaska
were
part
of
a
tribe,
any
tribe.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
they
were--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we'd
have
to
make...
we'd
make
the
same
case
there
as
we
would
here.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let
me
answer
that...
there
are
several
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
in
the
first
place,
that
when
those
events
occurred,
and
that
was
in
the
1890's,
when
the
hawaii
constitutional
monarchy
was
replaced
with
a
republic
and
then
became
ceded
to
the
united
states.
native
hawaiians,
as
they
are
being
defined
in
this
case,
were
less
than
half
the
population
of
that
constitutional
monarchy.
in
other
words,
there
were
people
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
ancestry
in
1778
that
were
a
part
of
that
operation,
that
country
and
that
area
at
that
time.
secondly,
this
business
about
the
lands
being
taken,
the
land
that
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
was
land
owned
by
the
government
of
hawaii.
it
didn't
leave
the
government
of
hawaii.
it
was
ceded
back
to
the
territory
immediately,
and
immediately
when
that
was
done
it
was
made
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
hawaii,
so
that
the
land
never
was
taken
from
any
individuals.
to
the
extent
that
land
was
taken--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course
not,
and
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--congress
does
make
history,
but
congress,
of
course,
can't
change
history.
i'm
not...
we're
not
accepting
everything
that's
in
the
so-called
apology
resolution.
what
i
am
saying
is,
it
would
make
no
difference,
because
it
would
not
have
any
rational
relationship
between
the
arbitrary
date
established
by
the
hawaiian
government
of
1778
and
the
dates
that
those
events
took
place.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
was
explaining,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
my
client
has
ancestors
that
go
back
to
1831.
he
had
two
ancestors
that
were
in
the
legislature
of
that
constitutional
monarchy,
so
to
the
extent
we're
singling
out
people
to
be
victims,
it
is
not...
cannot
conceivably
be
limited
to
people
that
have
relations
in
hawaii
in
1778,
when,
by
the
way,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
as
it
presently
stands,
the
number
of
people
who
are
hawaiians,
or
native
hawaiians
are
about
20
percent
of
the
population.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
yes,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
fact,
the
united
states
had
treaties
with
the
monarchy
of
hawaii.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
because
there
wasn't
a
tribal
government
at
the
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
before
18--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
as
i
understand
it,
between
1890
and
19...
1810
there
was
a
civil
war
going
on.
1810
is
the
date
when
hawaii--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
may
have
had
power
to
deal
with
the
entity.
it
may
have
had
power
under--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--foreign
policy
powers
to
deal
with
the
entity,
but
we're
talking
about,
and
we're
talking
about
a
period
of
time
before
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment,
which
made
very
clear
what
our
country
would
do
with
respect
to
racial
discriminations,
and
if
we
pick
any
date
in
history
after
1778,
the
hawaiian
population
consists
of
people
that
are
in
protected...
in
the
benefited
class
here,
and
are
not
in
the
benefited
class.
and
i
want
to
return
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
indians.
the
respondents
state
at
page
2
of
their
brief
that
hawaiians,
the
native
hawaiians
and
hawaiians
here
are
historically
and
anthropologically
distinct
from
american
indians.
that's
a
concession
in
the
case.
it's
a
concession
in
the
case
that
they
are
not
tribes.
this
group
of
individuals,
however
we
define
them,
wouldn't
receive
recognition
by
the
federal
government
as
a
tribe,
because
they
have
not
had
a
substantially
continuous
tribal
existence.
they
haven't
functioned
throughout
history
as
an
autonomous
tribal
entity.
they
haven't
had
historical
political
influence
as
a
tribe.
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
difficult
situation
in
which
an
arbitrary
date
in
history
is
selected
out.
what
the
state
of
hawaii
and
the
united
states
government
are
saying
here
is
that
because
someone
is
related
to
someone
who
is
in
a
part
of
the
united
states
before
it
became
a
part
of
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
do
not
think
so,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
see
where
it
would
come
from
in
the
constitution.
secondly,
what
we
have
here
is,
and
i'm
going
to
put
back
into
your
hypothetical
what
we
have
here,
which
are
remote
descendants
of
the
people.
now,
let's
move
forward
200
years.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
forever
and
ever
and
ever.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
that
that's
consistent
at
all
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
especially
if
it
involved
voting.
if
it
didn't
involve
voting,
we'd
only
be
dealing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
this
court
is
required,
with
respect,
if
we
step
to
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
is
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
ancestry
which
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
is
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
fourteenth
amendment
issue
that
we'll
focus
on,
this
court
has
said
racial
classifications,
and
we
don't
need
to
look
into
motives
here,
or
legislative
history,
or
anything
else.
this
is
a
racial
classification
on
its
face.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
i
answered
that,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
i
don't
know
where
the
power,
that
power
would
come
from.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
to
make
a
distinction
among
citizens
on
the
basis
of
race
in
the
voting
booth,
i
think
that
is
precluded
by
the
fifteenth--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
think
that...
yes.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
under
the
foreign
policy
powers
of
the
united
states.
yes,
they
can
deal
with
this
group
of
people.
we're
not
talking
about
bringing
them
in
and
making
them
citizens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course.
of
course.
let
me
just
say,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
that
there
is
nothing
remotely
close
to
a
compelling
governmental
reason
here
even
offered
by
respondent,
except
to
justify,
we
have
to
have...
limit
people
on
the
basis
of
race
in
the
voting
booth
because
we're
going
to
limit
people
on
the
basis
of
race
on
the
recipient
end.
that
is
discrimination
as
an
end
justifying
a
discriminatory
means.
that
cannot
be
a
compelling
justification.
there's
not
remote
narrow
tailoring
here.
it's
obvious
overclassification
and
underclassification.
it
is
unlimited
in
time,
to
use
the
words
of
the
adarand
decision,
and
unlimited
in
terms
of
descendants
from
the
individuals
who
are
purportedly
related
to
the
class.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
with
the
court's
permission.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
and
the
united
states
government
have
read
the
constitution
differently,
this
court's
decisions
with
respect
to
its
authority
over
quasi-sovereign
indian
tribes
differently,
and
the
federal
statutes
that
deal
with
hawaiians
and
other
minority
groups
differently
than
we
have
read
them.
we
believe,
and
we
think
it's
clear
from
this
court's
decisions,
that
the
authority
of
congress...
and
it
is
of
congress,
it's
not
of
the
states,
and
it
may
only
be
delegated
in
a
very
narrow,
explicit
way.
that
is
the
word
that
was
used
by
this
court
in
the
yakima
nation
case,
only
under
very
limited
circumstances
with
respect
to
the
criminal
laws
of
a
particular
state.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
answer
that
question,
for
this
reason.
each
of
those
statutes
is
different.
some
of
them
have
to
do
with
things
like
the
smithsonian,
and
cultural
benefits,
and
the
study
of
a
culture.
some
of
them
have
to
do
with
pure
racial
preferences
with
respect
to
government
contracting.
some
of
them
are
in
different
categories.
this
court
would
have
to
look
at...
if
this
is
a
race-based
distinction,
and
we
don't
see
any
basis
for
arguing
that
it
is
not
a
race-based--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
should
have
made
myself
clear.
this
case,
as
i
said
at
the
very
beginning,
the
simplest,
narrowest,
easiest
basis
upon
which
this
case
could
be
decided
is
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
am
aware
of
no
federal
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
will
be
litigation.
almost
invariably
there
is
whenever
this
court
makes
a
decision,
justice
stevens,
but--
[laughter]
and
there
was
as
a
result
of
the
chadha
decision,
and
there
was
as
a
result
of
the
adarand
decision,
but
this
court
will
perform
its
function,
or
lower
courts
will
perform
their
function
of
examining
statutes
that
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
on
their
face
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
standard
and,
justice
scalia,
it's
correct
that
only
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
involved
here.
the...
with
respect
to
as
far
as
the
court
need
to
go.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
is
no
statute
of
which
i'm
aware
that
creates
special
voting
privileges
for
native
alaskans,
and
there
are
different...
there
are
tribes
in
alaska
that
would
possibly
be
treated
differently
under
these
statutes.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand,
for
example...
one
of
the
statutes
considered
by
this
court
in
adarand
gave
a
racial
privilege
in
the
contracting
area
to
asian
pacific
islanders.
i
don't
know
whether
that
included
native
hawaiians
or
not.
let
me
clarify
one
point
that
i
think
was
confused
by
both
mr.
kneedler
and
mr.
roberts.
according
to
page
18
of
the
respondent's
opposition
to
certiorari,
oha
beneficiaries
are
determined
without
regard
to
any
tribal
classification,
and
they
go
on
to
say
the
tribal
concept
has
no
place
in
the
history
of
hawaii.
that
leaves
them
with
this
notion,
and
let
me
close
on
this
note.
they
argue
that
the
united
states
government
and,
as
a
result
of
some
intangible,
unclear
delegation,
states,
may
make
classifications
of
people
based
upon
a
remote
ancestor
who
is
an
aboriginal
person.
that
means...
and
as
far
as
the
eyes
can
see
and
as
far
as
the
time
might
go,
that
people
can
present
cards
showing
their
racial
ancestry
to
the
united
states
government
and
to
the
state
of
hawaii
and
if
they
have
an
aboriginal
ancestor,
they
get
in
the
preferred
line.
that
puts
people
in
that
category--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
