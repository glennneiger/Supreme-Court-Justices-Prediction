mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
october
26,
1983,
petitioner
effected,
that
is
it
arranged
under
its
contracts,
advanced
its
credit
and
paid
for
a
supply
of
bunker
fuel
oil
at
jeddah,
saudi
arabia.
3
weeks
earlier
it
had
effected
a
similar
supply
in
new
york.
at
all
relevant
times
the
vessel,
william
hooper,
was
operating
in
the
maritime
commerce
of
the
united
states.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
with
respect
to
exxon's
delivery
in
new
york,
exxon
was
entitled
to
admiralty
jurisdiction,
it
was
entitled
to
a
lien,
and
it
was
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
however,
with
respect
to
exxon's
delivery
at
jeddah,
saudi
arabia,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
case
was
outside
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
district
court's
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
based
on
this
court's
1855
decision
in
minturn
v.
maynard.
minturn
stands
for
a
per
se
rule
that
the
services
provided
by
general
agents
are
outside
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
your
honor,
the
primary
question
is
whether
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
suit--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--it
is
possible
to
find
that,
your
honor.
however
the
evidence
on
this
subject,
as
we
will
get
to
later,
is
crystal
clear
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
exxon
should
be,
but
for
the
minturn
rule,
entitled
to
a
lien.
since
minturn
there
has
been
a
transformation
in
the
legal
thinking--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--for
the
furnishing
of--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--there,
in
such
cases
there
will
be,
presuming
the
necessary
ingredient
is
admiralty
jurisdiction,
but
whether
there
is
a
lien
will
depend
perhaps
on,
to
some
extent
on
the
status
of
the
party
providing
the
lien
involved.
but
if
there
is
a
particular
clause
in
the
contract,
such
as
there
is
in
this
case,
then
clearly
under
the
existing
law
that
party
should
be
entitled
to
a
lien.
not
all
admiralty
jurisdiction
cases
give
rise
to
a
lien.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
your
honor,
i
could
certainly
conceive
of...
i
would
believe
that
in
the
area
of
physical
supplies
of
necessaries
to
vessels,
in
most
cases
that
i
can
conceive
of
right
now
that
should
probably
give
rise
to
a
lien.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
there
is--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
the
payment
of
insurance
premiums.
they
do
not
give
rise
to
a
lien
and
are
not
considered
necessaries
under
the
lien
act.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
absolutely.
this
court's
decision
in
insurance
co.
v.
dunham.
since
minturn
there
has
been
a
transformation
in
the
legal
thinking
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
first,
a
contract,
in
order
to
be
maritime,
need
not
be
performed
substantially
on
the
sea.
secondly,
this
court
has
recognized
that
at
the
heart
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
maritime
commerce.
the
minturn
rule
excludes
the
services
provided
by
general
agents,
which
all
agree
are
critical
to
maritime
commerce.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
commentators
and
the
courts,
including
the
second
circuit,
have
urged
that
this
court
reject
the
minturn
rule.
respondent
argues
that
to
reject
the
minturn
rule
will
open
up
the
federal
courts
to
suits
by
all
agents
of
all
types.
we
submit
that
this
is
incorrect.
first,
minturn
itself
is
a
discrete
rule.
as
the
commentators,
and
i
make
particular
reference
to
gilmore
and
black
at
pages
22
and
29
of
their
treatise,
have
indicated
that
in
other
areas
of
jurisdictional...
in
other
jurisdictional
areas
the
jurisdiction
is
fairly
well
defined.
secondly,
there
is
a
rational
jurisdictional
boundary
that
has
already
been
offered.
this
court
has
never
ruled
on
the
so-called
preliminary
contract
doctrine.
however,
in
the
recent
decision
in
the
second
circuit
of
ingersoll
milling
v.
bodena,
which
is
found
at
829
f.
2d
293,
specifically
at
page
302,
that
court
has
offered
a
jurisdictional
rationale
which
seems
to
make
sense
and
is
consistent
with
the
commentators.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--i
think
a
redefined
preliminary
contract
rule,
as
apparently
exists
in
bodena,
would
be
an
acceptable
way
to
delimit
admiralty
jurisdiction.
specifically
in
the
bodena
case
there
was
an
agent
involved.
that
was
a
freight
forwarding
agent.
the
freight
forwarding
agent
performed
certain
services.
specifically
he
arranged
and
he
prepared
bills
of
lading.
under
the
old
preliminary
contract
rule
such
services
would
be
considered
preliminary
because
they
were
preliminary
to
the
actual
marine
contract,
i.e.
the
bill
of
lading.
the
bodena
court,
however,
did
not
so
hold,
and
it
held
that
the
services
provided
by
the
freight
forwarding
agent
were
themselves,
quote,
"essential
to
the
voyage",
unquote,
and
on
that
basis
held
that
those
services
were
not
preliminary
services.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
essence
of
what
is
going
on
in
here,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
you
don't
look
to
what
is
going
on
physically
on
the
vessel
but
you
look
at
the
essence
of
the
transaction
in
a
maritime
contract.
and
what
was
going
on
here
was
that
exxon
was
not
only
arranging
under
its
contracts,
but
it
was
advancing
its
credit
and
it
was
paying
for
the
fuel.
without
exxon's
involvement
that
physical
delivery
never
would
have
taken
place.
perhaps
more
importantly,
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
the
key
here
should
be
that
what
is
being
done
is
there
is
a
performance
of
a
service
that
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
voyage.
and
that,
i
think,
would
be
the
key
to
any
jurisdictional
rationale.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
and
in
fact--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--in
fact,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
rejecting
the
minturn
rule
itself
should
enable
any
general
agent
to
have
admiralty
jurisdiction.
that
is
not
inconsistent,
and
in
fact
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
what
we
are
saying
with
respect
to
other
agents.
if
you
have
a
traditional
maritime
agent,
such
as
a
freight
forwarder,
who
performs
services
which
are
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
voyage,
not
perhaps
the
general
business
of
shipping
but
the
operation
of
the
voyage,
then
such
services
should
be
considered
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
devil
that
we
do
know
has
led
to
mass
confusion--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief.
to
answer
your,
your
honor's
question
specifically,
certainly,
if
i
may
step
back
and
take
the
cargo
setting,
if
somebody
performs
services
that
lead
to
cargo
being
put
on
board
the
vessel
the
argument
would
perhaps
be
the
same,
that
the
cargo
is
the
service.
i
would
submit
that
the
physical
operation
of
the
vessel
is
a
higher
degree,
or
a
stronger
degree,
of
what
is
going
on,
and
you
could
make
a
rational
distinction
and
keep
both
cargo,
the
cargo
broker
and
the
passenger
or
the
reservation
people
out,
but
yet
keep
people
who
run
the
vessel,
people
who
provide
fuel,
people
who
provide
the
crew,
people
who
provide
what
is
necessary
for
navigational
activity
in.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it's
almost
by
definition
that
a
general
agent
performs
key
services
on
behalf
of
the
vessel.
and
it's
almost
by
definition
that
the
general
agent
should
be
in
because
he
is
performing
services
which
are
essential
to
the
voyage.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
there
are
several
definitions
of
what
a
general
agent
is.
i
believe
in
this
case
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
the
definition
should
really
key
off
continuity
of
service.
so
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
there
may
conceivably
be
some
situations
in
which
a
general
agent
does
not
provide
services
that
are
critical
to
the
operation
of
the
voyage,
but
right
now
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
such
situations.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
it
would
depend
on
what
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
but
certainly
in
the
normal
course
of
the
way
the
steamship
business
runs,
as
i
say,
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
situation
where
a
general
agent
would
be
performing
services
which
were
not
essential
to
the
voyage.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
that
certainly
was
something
that
we
opposed
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
but
lost,
and
we
take
that
finding
for
what
it
is.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
the
corollary
or
the
other
part
of
what
we're
arguing
here
is
really
one
and
the
same,
because
if...
certainly
exxon
is
performing
an
essential
maritime
service.
and--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--well,
simply
because
the
finding,
the
final
finding
in
this
case,
is
that
exxon
was
a
general
agent.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
yes.
and
under
the
doctrine--
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
--that
is
the
per
se
rule
of
minturn,
yes.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
found,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
if
you
take
the
proposition
that
a
general
agent
is
one
who
provides
continuity
of
service,
which
is
what
the
restatement
on
agency
provides,
then
we
are
a
general
agent
and
we
are
therefore
covered
by
the
minturn
rule.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
we
made
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
lost.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
i
perhaps
would
be
not
speaking
fairly
about
the
court
of
appeals
if
i
were
to
say
that
they
would
agree
with
that.
i
believe
that
they
would
probably
still
be
looking
for
some
finding
of
an
essential
marine
supply.
and
certainly
in
the
run-of-the-mill
minturn,
peralta,
binnings-type
cases
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
a
general
agent
provides
key
maritime
services,
and
not
simply
napkins.
i
have
never
seen
such
a
case
in
the
general
agency
setting.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
it
does
not
follow
a
fortiori.
and
in
fact
it
is
only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
in
second
circuit,
that
the
second
circuit
has
fused
the
general
agency
rule
with
the
preliminary
contract
rule,
that
they
have
cited
cases
like
minturn
in
nongeneral
agency
cases.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
we're
only
asking
that
you
overrule
the
per
se
arbitrary
rule
in
minturn.
and
there
is
no
danger
there
in
setting
any
greater
boundaries
for
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
the
rule
simply
would
be
that
any
services
that
are
performed
by
a
traditional
maritime
agent
that
are
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
voyage
would
be
entitled
to
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
if
it
were
still
within
our
power
to
argue
that
we
weren't
a
general
agent
we
would
certainly
argue
that
in
the
alternative.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
certainly
have
not
urged
those
arguments
here.
the
logical
corollary
to
this
rule
would
be
that
any
agent
in
the
maritime
area
who
provides
essential
maritime
services
and
who
advances
his
credit
and
pays
for
them
is
entitled
to
a
lien.
that
is
consistent
with
the
commentators
and
that
is,
i
would
refer
the
court
specifically
to
gilmore
and
black
at
pages
31
and
to
benedict
at
section
183.
it
is
also,
of
course,
consistent
with
the
goal
of
admiralty
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
protection
and
the
promotion
of
maritime
commerce,
and
not
the
lining
up
of
contracts
along
a
chain.
in
this
case
exxon,
but
for
minturn,
should
have
a
lien.
that
is
true
under
the
decisions
in
the
golden
gate
and
it
is
also
true
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
exxon
advanced
its
credit
under
panamanian
flag
barge.
there
should
be
no
remaining
issue
before
this
court.
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
why
any
other
points
that
have
been
urged
by
central
gulf
are
insubstantial.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
judicial
economy
and
also
for
purposes
of
clarity
in
this
confusing
area,
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
and
in
keeping
for
the
court
to
pass
on
the
lien
question
and
direct
the
lower
court
below
to
enter
judgment
in
favor
of
exxon.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
first,
with
respect
to
the
reference
to
the
columbia
law
review
article
by
professor
black,
i
believe
that
that
article
quite
clearly
states
in
the
critique
section
that
there
are
a
list
of
irregular
verbs
that
seem
to
have
no
principle,
but
i
also
believe
that
what
the
professor
says
there
is
that
in
that
article
that
is
how
he
reads
the
present
cases.
however,
at
pages
261
and
then
again
at
273
and
beyond
he
goes
on
to
suggest
that
should
not
be
the
case.
it
happens
to
be
the
case
now.
central
gulf
has
raised
the
point
and
says
that
all
agency
contracts
are
preliminary
contracts.
that
depends
on
your
definition
of
a
preliminary
contract.
we
have
urged
the
definition
provided
by
the
bodena
court,
provided
by
benedict,
and
provided
by
gilmore
and
black,
that
makes
sense.
it's
not
a
mechanical
lining
up
of
the
contracts.
secondly,
exxon
in
this
case
supplied
bunkers.
that
is
the
key
ingredient
to
make
a
vessel
propelled...
be
propelled
in
maritime
commerce.
it
is
the
classic
service.
as
the
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
golden
gate
indicated,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
physicial
supply
to
be
made
by
the
plaintiff.
in
that
case
the
supply
was
made
by
a
third-party
supplier.
that
is
precisely
the
case
here.
exxon
did
not
make
the
physical
supply,
but
that
should
not
matter.
furthermore,
clearly,
under
any
analysis
exxon's
involvement
here
was
not
preliminary.
the
proof
shows
that
the
local
supplier
refused
to
make
the
supply.
if
exxon
had
not
jumped
in
and
put
its
contract
on
the
line
the
supply
would
not
have
happened.
exxon's
involvement
was
essential
to
the
voyage.
the
proof
also
shows
that
exxon
advanced
its
credit
and
it
paid
for
the
fuel.
in
fact
it
remained
involved
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
contract
provides
if
there
was
an
oil
spill
exxon
reserved
the
right
to
clean
that
spill
up.
also,
the
contract
provides
that,
if
there
was
a
quality
or
quantity
claim,
waterman
came
to
exxon
for
that,
not
to
arabian
marine.
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
planned...
preplanned
premium
services
does
not
address
the
general
agency
minturn
issue.
in
fact
it
only
involves
insurance
premiums,
and
those
insurance
premiums
are
not
essential
to
the
operation
of
any
voyage.
in
fact,
as
i
already
indicated,
they
do
not
give
rise
to
a
lien,
and
they
are
not
essential
services.
mr.
armand
maurice
pare,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
minturn
