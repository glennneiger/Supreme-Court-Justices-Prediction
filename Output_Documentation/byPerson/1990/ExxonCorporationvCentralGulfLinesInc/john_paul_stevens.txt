justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr
pare?
in
your
view
was
exxon
a
general
agent?
justice
stevens
so
all
the
talk
about
general
agents
doesn't
really
decide
this
case
if
exxon
is
not
a
general
agent?
justice
stevens
well,
i
can
understand
an
argument
that
an
agent
that
performs...
services
essential
to
the
voyage
be
the
kind
of
relationship
that
supports
admiralty
jurisdiction.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
all
the
argument
about
the
status
of
general
agents,
and
why
that
is
relevant
to
this
particular
case.
justice
stevens
was
a
general
agent?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
i
don't
understand,
you
are
not
arguing
that
even
if
minturn
continues
to
state
the
correct
rule
for
general
agents,
you
should
nevertheless
win
because
you're
the
kind
of
agent
that
provided
essential
services
and
therefore
should
support
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
i
see.
you
think
you're
beaten
by
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
on
that?
justice
stevens
would
that
include
some
general
broker
in
the
oil
business
who
could
just
buy
and
sell
oil
all
over
the
world,
and
just
happened
to
fill
a
contract
in
one
place?
justice
stevens
what
about
a
spot
purchase
just
for
a
particular
vessel?
then
it
would
be
covered,
i
guess,
even
if
just
through
a
general
broker?
it's
the
only
contact
he
ever
had
with
the
company,
but
he
arranged
a
purchase
to
fill
up
the
ship
when
it
left
saudi
arabia
or
wherever
it
was.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
montbach?
supposing
exxon
had
not
paid
the
saudi
arabian
retailer,
whatever,
the
arabian
marine
or
whatever
its
name
was--
justice
stevens
--would
arabian
marine
have
had
a
lien
on
the
ship?
justice
stevens
so
if
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
general
creditors
wondering
when
the
ship
is
subject
to
a
lien,
they
could
assume
normally
the
supplier
would
have
a
lien,
but
then
they'd
realize
they'd
have
these
cases
where
there's
an
indirect
relationship
which
would
be
excluded
from
what
would
otherwise
be
the
general
lien
for
fuel?
justice
stevens
because
they
relied
on
exxon.
justice
stevens
but
it's
only
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
arabian
and
marine
and
exxon
that
brings
that
about,
something
which
the
other
general
creditors
wouldn't
be
aware
of.
justice
stevens
without
getting
paid
first.
justice
stevens
yeah,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
mr.
montbach,
supposing
they
had
constructed
a
little
different
kind
of
legal
relationship
between
the
marine
company
in
saudi
arabia
and
exxon
pursuant
to
which
they
had
said
we,
exxon,
want
to
buy
100,000
gallons
of
oil
to
be
resold
to
the
ship
owner
of
the
ship--
justice
stevens
--and
then
in
effect
said
well,
title
will
pass
to
us
as
soon
as
you
pump
it
through
the
pipe
and
then
it
will
pass
from
us
to
the
ship
owner
10
seconds
thereafter,
and
you
will
be
our
agent
for
delivering
our
oil
while
we
own
it
and
while
you're
delivering
it
to
the
other.
so
that
they
got
title
to
the
oil,
you
know,
exxon.
they
would
then
have
a
lien,
i
guess,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
and
you
do
argue,
don't
you,
that
even
if
there's
maritime
jurisdiction
that
the
terms
of
the
lien
act
don't
cover
this
particular
facts?
justice
stevens
or
for
this
agent
even.
