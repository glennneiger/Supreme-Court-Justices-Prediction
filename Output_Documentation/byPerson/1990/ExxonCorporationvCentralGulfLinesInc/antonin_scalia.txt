justice
scalia
mr.
pare,
before
you
go
any
further,
do
you...
what
do
we
have
before
us
here?
the
question
whether
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction
or
the
question
whether
there
is
an
admiralty
lien,
or
both,
or
is
the
one
automatically
subsumed
within
the
other?
justice
scalia
can
i
find
that
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
say
that
i
don't
know
whether
there's
a
lien
or
not?
is
that
possible?
justice
scalia
of
course
they
could
recite
in
the
contract
i
am
relying
exclusively
upon
the
solvency
of
the
owner.
if
they
recited
that
in
the
contract
there
wouldn't
be
an
implied
lien,
right?
justice
scalia
but
it
would
still
be
an
admiralty
contract.
justice
scalia
so
it
would
be
resolved
in
an
admiralty
court--
justice
scalia
--but
without
a
lien.
justice
scalia
what
about
a
travel
agent
who
gets
the
passengers
for
a
cruise
line?
would
that
be
an
admiralty
contract?
i
mean,
i
assume
if
you're
carrying
passengers
they're
just
as
essential
for
your
voyage
as
if
you're
carrying
freight.
i
have
trouble...
you
know,
it's
the
devil
we
know
is
maybe
better
than
the
one
we
don't
know.
i
don't
know
where
we're
going
if
we--
justice
scalia
--he's
a
pretty
bad
devil,
yes.
justice
scalia
the
court
of
appeals
really
thought
that
if
you
supplied
napkins
to
the
ship
regularly
for
20
years
you
become
a
general
agent?
is
that
it,
just
continuity?
it
doesn't
matter
subject
matter
at
all?
justice
scalia
tell
me
if
i'm
right.
i
understand
it
to
be
the
case
that
the
question
whether
there's
a
lien
and
whether
there's
maritime
jurisdiction
are
separate
questions,
but
because
of
this
maritime
lien
act
they
tend
to
merge,
because
maritime
jurisdiction
is
important
not
just
because
you
get
before
a
maritime
court
but
because
if
it...
if
there
is
maritime
jurisdiction
the
maritime
lien
act
applies
and
you
get
the
lien
on
much
more
liberal
terms
than
you
otherwise
would.
you
don't
have
to
show
all
sorts
of
things
that
you
would
otherwise
have
to
show.
is
that
what's
going
on
here?
justice
scalia
they
don't
really
care
what
court
they
get
into,
whether
it's
a
maritime
court
or
not.
they
want
the
lien,
right?
justice
scalia
why
can't...
wow.
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
agency
contracts,
general
agencies,
and
now
we're
talking
about
preliminary
versus
nonpreliminary.
why
can't
we
adopt
that
rule,
i
mean,
the
rule
that
preliminary
contracts
don't
make
it,
but
no
rule
that
agency
contracts
as
a
class
don't
make
it
at
all?
is
every
agency
contract
involved
with
preliminary
contract?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
you
haven't
made
anything
about
that.
i
have
not
understood
your...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
can
equate
what
we're
talking
about
here
with
simply
proximity
to
maritime
commerce,
because
the
fact
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
an
agent.
you
have
to
be
a
general
agent
to
come
within
the
disqualifying
rule.
so
that
if
the
ship
company
had
come
to
exxon
and
simply
said
on
a
one-shot
deal,
had
no
continuing
relationship
with
exxon,
just
said,
either
give
me
oil
yourself
or
get
somebody
else
to
give
me
oil,
if
they
had
said
that
just
for
this
one
occasion,
exxon
wouldn't
be
a
general
agent.
and
even
if
exxon
acted
as
an
agent
and
got
someone
else
to
provide
the
oil,
they
wouldn't
be
barred
from
the
lien,
would
they?
justice
scalia
possibly?
justice
scalia
i
thought
it's
just
general
agents
that
are
covered,
and
i
wouldn't
consider
that
a
general
agent.
what
does
general--
justice
scalia
--right.
justice
scalia
so
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
proximity.
it
has
to
do
with
general
agency.
justice
scalia
yeah.
i
thought
your
rule
made
a
lot
of
sense.
i
could
figure
that
one
out.
is
it
direct?
you
know,
are
you
putting
the
oil
on
the
boat
or
not.
but
it
turns
out
that's
not
the
rule.
you
don't
have
to
put
the
oil
on
the
boat.
it's
just
whether
you're--
justice
scalia
--what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
you
want
us
to
reaffirm
minturn
or
do
you
want
us
to
adopt
your
rule,
which
is--
justice
scalia
--well,
but
that's
not
the
rule
you
have
been
talking
about.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do--
justice
scalia
--well,
you
don't
have
to
be...
it
can
be
a
preliminary
contract
so
long
as
you're
not
a
general
agent,
so
long
as
you
don't
do
this
regularly.
it
can
still
be
a
preliminary
contract.
justice
scalia
that's
true.
justice
scalia
how
can
congress
change
it?
can
congress
change
it?
justice
scalia
there's
no
equation
between
what
the
constitution
means
by
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
what
the
statute
does?
justice
scalia
you
don't
expect
congress
to
pass
a
statute...
would
congress
responsibly
be
passing
a
statute
that
ignores
minturn?
could
it
do
that?
justice
scalia
to
be
within
admiralty
jurisdiction?
how
can
congress--
--congress
is...
our
court
held
in
1825
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
was
limited
to
tidal
waters.
congress
passed
a
law
saying
no,
it
extends
to
the
great
lakes,
and
in
the
genesee
chief
we
upheld
that.
justice
scalia
we're
not
talking
the
lien
act,
we're
talking
about
admiralty
jurisdiction.
