justice
kennedy
well,
will
there
be
cases
in
which
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction
but
no
lien
when
the
cause
of
action
is
to
recover
for
the
furnishing
of
money
or
supplies?
justice
kennedy
of
money
or
supplies.
justice
kennedy
no,
because
there
are
admiralty
collision
cases,
et
cetera.
but
will
there
be
cases
in
which
there
are
suit
brought
for
recovery
of
monies
on
account
of
monies
or
supplies
advanced
to
the
shipper
where
there
will
be
admiralty
jurisdiction
but
no
lien?
justice
kennedy
well,
was
this
case
even
within
the
minturn
rule?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
kennedy
you
couldn't
make
the
argument
that
in
minturn
there
was
a
wide
variety
of
services,
and
here
just
the
supply
of
fuel?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it--
--did
you
understand
the
rule
suggested
by
mr.
pare,
is
that
the
same
rule
that
you
suggest
or
are
there
differences
between
you?
justice
kennedy
are
agency
contracts
somehow
to
be
discouraged
because
they
are
not
promotive
of
sound
growth
for
admiralty
and
for
maritime
commerce?
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
a
secret
lien,
but
the
last
in
time
always
prevails,
this
odd
rule
in
admiralty,
so
that
it's
not
really
so
bad
either,
is
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
anybody
provides
services
and
they're
last
in
time,
then
they
collect.
justice
kennedy
it's
an
in
rem
against
what?
justice
kennedy
would
our
courts
have
authority
to
do
that,
or
would
that
contradict
the
existing
statute?
justice
kennedy
no,
would
our
courts
have
the
authority
to--
justice
kennedy
--adopt
such
a
rule
that
the
lien
is
in
rem
but
doesn't
follow
the
vessel,
or
would
that
contradict
the
existing
statute?
justice
kennedy
what
are
the
time
limitations
on
enforcing
a
lien?
justice
kennedy
just
laches,
or--
justice
kennedy
--is
it
your
submission
that
overruling
of
minturn
would
be
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
purchase
and
sale
of
vessels?
