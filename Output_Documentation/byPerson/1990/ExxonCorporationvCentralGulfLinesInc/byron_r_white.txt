justice
white
i
take
it,
would
you
say
that
the...
when
exxon
itself
is
furnishing
the
fuel,
such
as
in
new
york,
would
that
contract
to
that
extent
be
within
maritime
jurisdiction?
justice
white
so
that
you
think--
justice
white
--that
contract
to
that
extent
would
be
within
maritime
jurisdiction?
justice
white
well,
didn't
they
do
a
little
bit
more
in
this
case?
they
not
only...
they
not
only
got
somebody
else
to
furnish
the
fuel,
but
it
became
necessary
for
them
to
pay
the
supplier.
and
they
paid
it.
it
was
just
like
they
bought
the
oil
and
then
sold
it
to
the
vessel,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
yeah,
but...
it
may
not
buy
it,
but
it
became
necessary
for
exxon
to
pay
the
supplier
itself.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
nevertheless
exxon
in
this
case
paid
the
supplier
for
the
fuel
that
the
supplier
furnished
to
the
vessel.
justice
white
well,
eventually,
just
as
soon
as
it
was
billed
it
paid.
justice
white
you
think
that's
legally
a
distinction
from
what
its
status
is
in
new
york?
justice
white
like
selling
oil
to
the
ship.
justice
white
like
selling
fuel
to
the
ship.
justice
white
i
know,
but
in
new
york
they
are
selling
it.
justice
white
and
that
is
a
direct
enough
connection
with
the
ship
to--
--the
claimant
owns
the
oil
and
supplies
it
directly
to
the
ship--
justice
white
eventually
they
did,
in
your
own
words.
justice
white
eventually
they
relied
on--
justice
white
--exactly.
justice
white
originally
arabian
was
furnishing
oil
directly
to
the
vessel--
justice
white
--without
relying
on
exxon's
credit.
justice
white
yes.
and
then
it
turned
out
that
the
vessel
wasn't
good
for
it,
i
guess.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
yes,
yes.
and
so
they
relied
on
exxon.
justice
white
and
exxon
said,
well,
so
we'll
pay
you.
justice
white
and
they
did.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
doesn't
change
the
situation
at
all--
justice
white
--with
respect
to
exxon?
justice
white
counsel,
what's
the
significance
of
any,
of
the
provision
in
the
contract
for
a
lien?
there
is
one,
isn't
there?
justice
white
for
what?
justice
white
and
so
you
think
that
provision
would
only
apply
to
situations
like
in
new
york?
justice
white
so
does
that
add
anything
to
maritime
law?
justice
white
then
you
might
as
well
leave
it
out?
justice
white
yeah,
but
here
they
say
they
would
have
a
lien
on
the
vessel,
wouldn't
they?
you
would
have
a
lien
on
the
vessel.
justice
white
and
that
seems...
they
certainly
were
contemplating...
both
sides
were,
i
suppose,
that
this
would
be
subject
to
maritime
law.
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
well,
do
you
really
think
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
dealt
with
this
matter
see
eye
to
eye
with
you?
justice
white
pretty
good
ones,
too.
justice
white
i
mean
pretty
substantial
ones.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
that
that's
the
submission
of
the
other
side.
i
thought
they,
i
thought
if
they
overruled
minturn
you
would
nevertheless,
you
still
would
have
to
sort
out
all
sorts
of
contracts
to
see
which
have
enough
connection
with
maritime
commerce.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know--
--yes,
but
aren't
those
statutory
questions?
i
mean,
the
lien
statute
doesn't
necessarily
cover
all
those.
it
seems
there
are
two
different
issues,
one,
where
there's
a
maritime
jurisdiction,
and
even
if
there
is
it
may
well
be
the
statute
doesn't
cover
all
these
different
kinds
of
agents.
justice
white
well,
exxon...
minturn
has
been
around
for
a
long
time,
yet
exxon
had
this
sort
of
a
contract.
