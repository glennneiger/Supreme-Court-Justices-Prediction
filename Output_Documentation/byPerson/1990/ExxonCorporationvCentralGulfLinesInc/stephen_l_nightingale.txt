mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
circuit
disposed
of
this
case
its
per
se
rule
that
agency
contracts
cannot
give
rise
to
obligations
enforceable
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
as
the
briefs
demonstrate,
that
rule
has
been
widely
criticized
by
other
courts,
by
commentators,
and
indeed
by
the
second
circuit
itself
in
the
peralta
case.
perhaps
even
more
important,
the
rule
produces
very
anomalous
results.
two
firms
furnishing
essentially
the
same
goods
or
services,
assuming
the
same
risk
of
nonpayment,
and
occupying
essentially
the
same
relationship
to
maritime
commerce
are
treated
differently
based
solely
on
the
legal
label
that
is
given
to
the
relationship
as
a
whole.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
test
should
be--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
this
case
is
the
perfect
example.
exxon--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--exxon,
with
respect
to
one
of
the
deliveries
at
issue,
the
new
york
delivery,
it
was
characterized
as
a
seller
and
it
won.
it
got
a
lien
as
xx
the
fuel
supplied
in
new
york
because
the
court
concluded
that
in
that,
with
respect
to
that
transaction,
it
was
wearing
its
seller
hat.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
correct.
the
second
circuit's
rule
is
whether
or
not
the
agent
is
a
so-called
special
agent,
a
general
agent,
or
an
agent
under
a
so-called
managing
agreement.
that
individual
or
that
firm
is
out
of
court
under
admiralty
jurisdiction
regardless
of
the
substance
of
what
it
does
for
the
ship
owner
or
the
shipping
industry.
and
we
think
that's
an
anomalous
rule.
our--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
with
this
qualification.
under
the
federal
lien
act
it's
not
necessary
for
that
claimant
to
prove
reliance
on
the
credit
of
the
vessel.
the
statute
establishes
a
presumption
which
unless
waived
by
means
of
a
showing
that--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--that
is
true,
again,
i'm
sorry,
with
one
qualification.
in
some
circuits
the
general
agent
rule
is
viewed
as
a
rebuttable
presumption.
in
the
third,
fourth,
and
fifth
circuits
a
general
agent
is
allowed
to
come
forward
with
an
express
or
implied
agreement
showing
reliance
on
the
credit
of
the
vessel
and
establish
a
lien.
the
second
circuit
holds
that
the
status
of
an
agency
forecloses
a
lien
altogether.
and
that
is
a
very
significant,
incidentally,
doctrinal
difference--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--we
believe
that
the
test
should
be,
should
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
goods
or
services
furnished,
regardless
of
the
legal
label.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
show
those
sorts
of
services
that
have
been
considered
traditionally
within
admiralty.
provision
of
fuel
to
a
vessel
is
a
traditionally...
is
a
traditional
necessary.
it
is
the
sort
of
service
that
has
traditionally
been
considered
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
extends
only
to
those
contracts
providing
goods
or
services
for
a
particular
vessel.
in
other
words,
if
the
contract
is
i'll
fill
your
tank
every
2
months,
and
some
of
it
may
go
into
your
vessels
and
some
of
it
may
go
into
your
office
buildings,
that
that
would
not
be
a
contract
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
an
owner
engages
someone
to
make
a
spot
purchase,
that
person
pays
for
the
fuel,
puts
it...
it
is
put
aboard
the
vessel,
whether
by
the
spot
purchaser
or
someone
else,
we
believe
that's
within
agency...
i
mean
within,
excuse
me,
admiralty
jurisdiction.
it
depends
again
on
the
substance
of
what
happened,
how
closely
related
is
the
service
or
the
provision
of
goods
in
relation
to
the
maritime
commerce.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
don't
understand
there
to
be
any
differences,
your
honor.
mr.
pare
operates
as
an
admiralty
lawyer.
i
don't.
he
operates,
i
believe,
with
an
understanding
of
what
it
is
that
a
general
agent
traditionally
does,
and
works
with
the
understanding
that
a
general
agent
is
a
husbanding
agent
who
buys
necessaries.
that
is
the
central
function
of
a
general
agent.
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
pare
would
suggest
that
if,
as
clause
10
of
a
general
agency
contract
it
was
agreed
that
the
agent
would
build
an
office
building,
that
that
would
be
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--in
this
particular
case
it's
essential.
in
other
cases
it
may
assure
access
to
a
federal
forum.
let
me
discuss
briefly
the
relationship
between
the
statute
and
the
lien,
because
i
understand
that
is
one
of
respondents'
principal
points
in
opposition
to
the
result
we
suggest.
respondents
suggest
that
the
statute
forecloses
adoption
of
the
rule
that
we
advocate
here.
the
statute
does
not
speak
to
what
causes
of
action
are
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
if,
for
example,
exxon
had
brought
an
in
personam
action,
i
don't
believe
it
could
fairly
be
argued
that
the
lien
act
would
foreclose
admiralty
jurisdiction.
so
what
the
lien
act
does,
as
your
honor
suggested,
is
to
provide
that
when
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
otherwise
available,
the
lien
act
is
potentially
available
as
a
means
of
providing
a
lien.
it
is
not
even
the
exclusive
source
of
a
lien,
incidentally.
it
does
not
purport
to
occupy
the
field
or
exclude
other
arguments
for
a
lien.
there
are
liens
that
exist
independent
of
the
statute.
a
second
point
in
opposition
to
the
rule
that
we
suggest
is
that
it
would
undercut
the
stability
and
certainty
in
an
area
of
jurisdiction.
the
devil
we
know
is
better
than
the
devil
we
don't
know.
first
of
all,
it's
clear
that
the
minturn
has
not...
the
rule
of
the
minturn
has
not
provided
stability
in
this
area.
there
is
disagreement
among
the
circuits
as
to
whether
special
agents
are
outside
the
rule,
as
to
whether
managing
operators
are
outside
the
rule,
even
within
the
confines
of
general
agents
as
to
whether
this
rule
is
a
presumption
or
a
conclusive
rule
of
law.
secondly,
this
court,
of
course,
could
select
from
among
those
approaches,
choose
one,
and
make
it
the
national
rule.
but
we
submit
that
so
long
as
the
rule
depends
on
status
and
not
function,
that
the
rule
will
continue
to
generate
uncertainty.
the
lines
between
agents,
special
agents,
managing
agents,
are
not
clear.
that's
point
number
1.
second
point,
so
long
as
those
distinctions
don't
line
up
with
the
substantive
considerations
underlying
admiralty
jurisdiction
they
will
be
the
subject
of
continuing
controversy.
they
are
traps
for
the
unwary,
as
presently
constructed,
as
the
court
indicated.
exxon
might
have
had
trouble
anticipating
that
it
would
be
considered
indistinguishable
from
mr.
minturn.
thirdly,
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
shipping
industry
is
less
important
now
than
in
the
1850's.
this
is
an
industry
whose
importance
is
growing.
the
grant
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
this
court
reflects,
first,
that...
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
reflects
first
the
national
importance
of
that
industry,
and
second,
we
believe,
the
judiciary's
responsibility
for
seeing
that
that
jurisdiction
is
exercised
in
a
rational
fashion,
in
cases
like
the
maret
and
the
genesee,
in
which
the
court
extended
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
the
inland
lakes
and
waters.
in
other
cases,
the
court
has
not
hesitated
to
reconsider
decisions
that
have
spawned
uncertainty
and
have
resulted
in
anomalous
limitations
on
jurisdiction.
thank
you
very
much.
