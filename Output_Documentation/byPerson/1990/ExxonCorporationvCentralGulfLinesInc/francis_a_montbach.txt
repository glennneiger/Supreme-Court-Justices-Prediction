mr.
francis
a.
montbach
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
rule
of
law
that
an
agency
contract
is
not
a
maritime
contract
should
be
overturned.
the
district
court
below
declined
to
grant
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
exxon's
claim,
holding
that
preliminary
services
are
not
within
such
jurisdiction.
while
preliminary
services
may
relate
to
maritime
services
and
are
often
helpful
for
the
operation
of
a
vessel,
they
are
essentially
nonmaritime
in
nature.
they
are
shoreside
services.
there
is
nothing
inherently
maritime
about
these
services.
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
preliminary
contracts
that
distinguishes
them
from
other
shoreside
contracts
or
warrants
the
extra
security
of
a
lien
upon
a
vessel.
in
this
instance
the
vessel--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--your
honor,
we
submit
that
an
agency
contract
is,
by
its
very
nature,
a
preliminary
contract.
it
is--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--it
is
no
different
from
any
other
non-maritime
contract.
in
this
instance
you
had
a,
they
were
providing
for
a
supplier.
they
were
not
supplying
themselves.
exxon
in
this
instance
placed
an
order
a
number
of
weeks
beforehand,
in
fact
took
over
an
order
that
had
been
placed
beforehand,
typical
of
an
agency,
and
then
sat
back,
did
nothing
with
regard
to
the
actual
supply...
someone
else
did
that,
someone
that
they
had
a
separate
arrangement
with...
and
then
a
week
or
so
afterwards
found
out
that
the
order
had
actually
been
fulfilled
and
then
did
their
other
administrative
function
of
a
collection.
so
that
we
don't
think
that
the
rule
should
be
changed
at
this
time.
in
a
commercial
context
it
is
known
that
agency
contracts,
general
agency
contracts,
are
not
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
at
that...
in
their
status
as
a
physical
supplier
in
new
york,
our
position
was
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
a
lien,
but
as
far
as
being
a
maritime
contract,
as
a
physical
supplier,
as
justice
o'connor
said--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--they
had
the--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--when
they
had
that
hat
on,
yes.
when
they
had
their
agency
hat
on
to
procure
somebody
else
or
to
provide
for
somebody
else,
be
it
themselves--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--no,
your
honor.
in
this
instance...
in
fact,
their
contract
was
applied...
it
provided
that
exxon
did
not
buy
the
fuel.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
that
was
part
of
their
longstanding
relationship,
their
agency
relationship--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--eventually,
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes.
they
were
billed
a
number
of
weeks
later
on,
your
honor.
but
this
was
part
of
the
longstanding--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
because
they
are
doing
this
as
part
of
their
agency
relationship.
it
is
not
an
advancement,
like
the
normal
situation
would
be.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
from
a
direct
supplier.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
direct
contract...
contact
with
the
navigational
operation
or
a
direct
juridical
contact
with
maritime
commerce.
in
this
instance--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--i
had
to
look
up
juridical
myself,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
understand.
[laughter]
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
it
means
that
they
had
to
be
involved
in
the
maritime
environment.
it
was
something
that
had
to
have
a...
almost
a
hands-on
relationship
with
the
supply.
in
this
instance--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--pardon
me?
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
they
were
not
selling
it,
your
honor.
they
were
arranging
for
someone
to
sell
it
to
the
ship.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes,
your
honor,
they
were.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
and
then
bills
directly
for
that,
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
that
is
a
supplier,
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
there's
a
direct
relationship.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
a
step
removed,
yes.
it
is
a...
there
is
a
preliminary
nature.
and
this
is
why
peralta,
binnings,
and
the
recent
case
in
planned
premium
services
talks
about
the
step
backwards,
even
though
the
service
may
be
essential,
not
quite
essential
but
necessary.
and
a
convenient
usage
in
the
maritime
industry
is
the
step
backwards.
it
is
not
a
maritime
contact
itself.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
arabian
marine.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
would
have,
possibly
under
saudi
law.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
as
far
as
saudi
is
concerned,
they
would
not
have
a
lien
under
the
u.s.
lien
statute,
because
they
specifically
relied...
i
mean,
arabian
marine--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--they
relied
on
exxon's
credit.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
well,
your
honor...
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
also
arabian
marine
specifically
in
this
instance
said
they
would
not
supply
the
vessel--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--they
would
not
supply
it
at
all
unless
exxon
said
we
will
guarantee.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
so
they
specifically
relied
on
the
credit
of
exxon.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
no,
they
came
to
exxon
and
said
we
will
not
supply
this
vessel.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
and
then
exxon
said
we
will
take
over
the
credit,
the
guarantee.
they
relied
upon
exxon's
promise
and
not
on
waterman's
promise.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes,
they
were.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
for
about
a
year-and-a-half
period.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
no,
it
turned
out
that
waterman--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--they
thought
waterman
was
not
good
for
it.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
and
they
did,
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
well,
it
doesn't
change
the--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--with
respect
to
exxon,
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
because
exxon
was
doing
so
as
part
of
their
longstanding
4-year-old
relationship
with
waterman.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
if
they
had
paid
for
it,
your
honor,
then
they
would
possibly
fall
within--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--within
the
advance
theory.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
no,
as
a
one
term,
as
a
one
shot,
one
vessel--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--one
port
proposal,
there
have
been
some
exceptions
to
this
minturn
rule
on
the
basis
of
the--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--it
has
to
do
with
whether
the
contract
that
is
entered
into
is
a
maritime
contract.
the
fifth
circuit
last...
a
week
or
so
ago
came
down
with
a
decision
saying
we
can't
look
at
the
quantitative/qualitative
aspects
of
this
in
a
particular
service
and
a
particular
instance.
we
have
to
have
a
general
rule
which
will
serve
the
national
interest
of
securing
a
stable,
uniform
rule
applicable
to--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--some
courts
have
held
it
as
the
exception
under
the
preliminary
contract
doctrine
which
is
part
of
this
general
agency
rule,
or
the
general
agency
rule
is
subsumed
within
it.
if
you
are
not
a
direct
supplier,
you're
not
doing
something
directly
or
operationally
involved
in
the
maritime
commerce
and
the
navigation
of
the
vessel,
then
you
are
not
entitled
to
admiralty
jurisdiction.
you
have
other
forums
you
can
go
to,
your
honor.
and
we
need
a
stable
rule
here,
not
as
the
second
circuit
said,
hair
splitting
a
case
by
case.
the--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--we
want
you
to
reaffirm
minturn.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
minturn,
as
it
is
part
of
the
preliminary
contract
rule,
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
preliminary
contracts
do
not
of
necessity
have
to
be
general
agency
rules,
but
general
agency
rules,
contract,
excuse
me,
are
preliminary
contracts.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
just
as
you
can
have...
if
you
don't
have
a
maritime
lien
you
don't
have
admiralty
jurisdiction.
but
you
can
have
admiralty
jurisdiction
without
having
a
maritime
lien.
your
honor,
it
is
our
feeling
that
there
has
to
be,
and
based
upon
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past,
substantial
justification
that's
apart
from
stare
decisis.
this
is
a
long-established
rule.
it
has
been
in
effect
for
135
years
at
least.
exxon
says
it's
anomalous
but
it
doesn't
effect
its
status.
the
fact
that
the
minturn
decision
may
have
gone
the
opposite
direction
in
1854
doesn't
change
its
status.
the
fact
is
it
has
been
a
rule
of
law
for
135
years.
commerce
has
gone
on
for
years,
for
135
years
on
the
basis
of
this
rule
of
law.
if
congress
at
some
point
in
time
decides
to
change
it,
then
it
will
do
so
prospectively,
not
retrospectively.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
congress
has
looked
at
this
area
four
times.
minturn
has
been
the
rule
for
135
years.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
your
honor,
there
is
an
equation,
yes.
and
this
court
can
address
admiralty
jurisdiction.
but
we're
saying
in
this
instance
we'd
have
to
take
our
guidance
from
congress.
congress
has
looked
at
what
constitutes--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--if
congress
wants
to
change
the
rule,
as
they
did
in
1910
and
in
1920
to
allow
beneficiaries...
in
this
instance
change
the
minturn
rule,
allow
general
agents
to
have
liens...
they
can
do
so.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes.
i'm
saying
that
the
congress
can
add
a
group
of
beneficiaries,
in
effect
expand
the
jurisdiction
to
include
a
class
within
admiralty
jurisdiction,
and
include
a
class
that
will
get
a
lien.
congress
did
that
in
1920
when
they
amended
the
lien
act
to
include
towage.
this
court
and
other
courts
between
1910
and
1920
said
no,
the
lien
act
does
not
provide
for
towage.
therefore--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--i
think
they're
mixed.
the
action
is
based
upon
the
lien
act
in
part,
your
honor.
the
action
is
based
upon
the
lien
act
and
traditional
maritime
law.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
and
other
courts
have
agreed
with
this,
that
maritime
liens
are
to
be
interpreted
strict
to
uris,
and
that
the
only
source
is
either
statute
xx
traditional
maritime
law.
and
if
a
lien
did
not
exist
under
the
statute
or
did
not
exist
under
traditional
maritime
law,
then
courts
should
not
grant
such
liens.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
they're
not
to
be
discouraged.
the
point
is
should
they
be
included
with
a
group
of
services
or
groups
of
beneficiaries
who
are
entitled
to
lien
of
vessel,
to
put
a
secret
lien
on
a
vessel
that
travels
with
that
vessel.
if
congress
or--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--it
does,
but
it's
still
secret
to
anyone
who
isn't
aware
of
it.
if
this
vessel
was
sold--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--if
the
vessel
was
sold
subsequent
to
that
last
provision
of
services
the
new
buyer
has
no
idea
that
there
is
a
lien
on
this
vessel.
other
jurisdictions,
england
and
canada,
create
an
in
rem
lien
for
someone
who
supplies
bunkers,
but
that
lien
does
not
follow
the
vessel.
it's
an
in
rem
statutory
lien.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
against
the
vessel,
but
it
does
not
follow
the
vessel
once
the
vessel
is
sold.
it's
a
statutory
in
rem
lien,
a
right
to
an
in
rem
action.
i
shouldn't
say
lien.
it's
an
in
rem
action.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
think
the
courts
would
have
the...
not
the
courts,
congress
would
have
the
ability--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--to
create
a
lien?
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
think
it
would
contradict
the
existing
statute.
i
think
the
courts
should
not
expand
liens,
create
liens,
either
by
analogy,
this
is
a
strict
to
uris
doctrine,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
general
provision
in
exxon's
boilerplate
contract
which
says
that
they
reserve
a
right
to
lien--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--for
the
provision
of
fuel,
themselves.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
think
as
far
as
exxon
is
concerned
it
applies
to
them
when
they
supply
themselves.
it
also
provides
that
the
supplying
company
has
a
lien
when
they
supply.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
don't
think
so,
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
in
this
instance,
yes.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
they
say
they
have
a
lien
on
the
vessel.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
don't
think
both
sides
were
contemplating
that.
remember,
there
are
three
sides
here.
we
have
exxon
entering
into
a
contract
with
waterman,
and
we
have
exxon
now
trying
to
enforce
that
against
central
gulf
lines,
the
owner
of
the
vessel.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
central
gulf
lines
had
a
contract
with
waterman
that
said
don't
put
any
liens,
we
prohibit
you
from
putting
any
liens
on
this
vessel.
but
we
once
again
have
in
exxon's
instance
a
boilerplate
global
contract
they
use
for
all
of
their
customers,
and
they
have
been
using
this
for
40
years.
i
don't
think
it
is
specific
enough
to
show
a
common
intent
on
the
part
of
exxon
and
waterman
to
put
a
lien
on
the
vessel
involved
herein.
in
effect
what
it's
saying
to
waterman
and
exxon,
exxon
knowing
full
well
what
the
financial
situation
of
waterman
was,
knowing
that
one
supplier
has
already
said
i'm
not
going
to
advance
anything
to
this
vessel
on
any
credit...
waterman
any
credit...
exxon
can
say
it's
all
right,
i'll
loan
you
the
money
as
part
of
our
ongoing
relationship.
i'm
in
effect
making
an
investment
in
you
to
keep
you
going,
because
a
third
party
over
there
who
knows
nothing
about
this
will
pay
me.
they
were
aware
this
was
a
chartered
vessel.
they
had
known
it
for
3
years.
this
is
the
type
of
situation
based
upon
this
long
standing
agency
relationship,
that
exxon
in
effect
could
be
considered
an
investor
in
waterman,
almost
a
part
owner
with
waterman.
they
had
$4
million
worth
of
credit
outstanding
before
this
lifting.
they
increased
it
by
$1.5
million,
more
than
the
value
of
this
lifting
at
that
time,
knowing
full
well
of
the
financial
condition
of
waterman.
now,
going
into
the
contract
itself,
your
honor,
the
contract
provides
that
exxon
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
navigation
of
the
vessel,
and
really
nothing
to
do
with
maritime
commerce.
as
i
said
before,
exxon
in
this
instance
confirmed
an
order
that
had
been
placed
by
waterman.
but
in
the
normal
instance
they
take
an
order,
they
put
it
on
a
telegraph
or
a
fax
machine
or
a
telex
machine,
pass
it
on
to
arabian
marine
in
this
instance,
in
general
terms
at
least
7
days
beforehand,
and
they
want
nothing
else
to
do
with
this.
they
say
you,
buyer,
are
responsible
for
letting
the
local
person
know
when
your
vessel
is
going
to
be
there
exactly.
you
are
responsible
for
any
mistakes
you
make
in
that.
you,
buyer,
are
responsible
for
everything
that
has
to
do
with
loading
the
vessel
with
this
fuel.
you,
buyer,
are
responsible
with
everything
afterwards.
you
have
to
pay
for
all
your
permits
and
everything.
the
next
time
exxon
has
anything
to
do
with
this
is
a
week
or
two
later
when
the
bill
comes
in.
they
are
totally
an
administrative,
shore
side,
and
in
this
instance
we
submit,
if
we're
going
to
make
a
difference
between
a
preliminary
and
a
general
agency
contract,
a
preliminary
contract
situation.
so
that
we
feel,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
in
minturn
individually
should
be
upheld
or
affirmed.
any
problems
as
far
as
the
so-called
splits
in
the
circuit,
our
brief
shows
that
the
circuits
are
not
at
odds
as
far
as
the
general
agency
rule.
as
recently
as
a
week
and
a
half
ago
the
minturn
holding
was
cited
with
approval
in
the
planned
premium
services
case--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--to
waterman.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
in
effect
the
argument
could
be
made
that
they
were
a
fictional,
or
legally
fictional...
a
supplier
themselves.
because...
and
i
think
the
cases
that
were
cited
for,
by
the
other
side
and
the
solicitor
general,
where
they're
saying
someone
who
doesn't
physically
supply
has
been
given
a
lien,
if
you...
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
those
cases.
but
in
some
of
them
they
did
say
that
there
was
a
chain
sale,
the
typical
petroleum...
and
you
talked
about
the
brokerage,
i
don't
know
if
it
was
you,
sir...
but
the
brokerage
thing.
a
chain
sale.
title
does
pass,
so
that
this
becomes
a
direct
supplier.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
even
though
it
is
for
10
seconds.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
so
that
we
feel
that
this
rule
should
be
upheld.
it
will
continue
the
stability
in
this
area
of
law.
justice
scalia
spoke
about,
cited
mr.
black's
columbia
law
review
article
in
sisson
v.
ruby
and
your
concurrence
about
the
irregular
verbs
that
are
better
learned
rather
than
changing
the
whole
grammar
around.
industry
has
gone
along
very
well,
with
a
few
exceptions,
and
there
are
not
a
lot
of
exceptions
to
this
general
rule.
there
has
to
be
some
special
justification
for
overturning
this
rule,
not
just
that
a
couple
of
commentators
think
it's
an
anomaly.
a
ship-building
contract
certainly
is
subject
to
the
same
arguments
that
are
being
made
with
regard
to
minturn.
it
was
the
same
court
that
handed
down
the
people's
ferry
case.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
think
as
far
as
the
general
agency
rule
is,
yes.
some
have
carved
out
some
exceptions,
but
they
have
recently--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--the
exceptions,
your
honor,
have
to
do
with--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--the
exceptions
have
to
do
with
entities
that
are
involved
with
the
operation,
the
physical
operation
of
the
vessel.
the
hadjipateras
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
which...
the
fifth
circuit
still
follows
the
general
agency
rule...
dealt
with
some,
an
entity
that
was
involved
with
the
physical
operation
of
the
vessel.
the
hinkins
in
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
dealt
with
an
entity
on
a
one-port,
one-call
situation
where
they
had
people
down
there
overseeing,
being
involved
in
the
physical
service
that
was
being
provided.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
instance,
and
in
the
general
rule
you
don't
have
that
with
husbanding
agents
or
general
agents
per
se.
they
contact
somebody.
it's
basically
having
a
black...
a
telephone
book.
well,
if
you're
in
jeddah,
see
so
and
so.
if
you're
in
rotterdam,
see
somebody
else.
there
is
no
direct
link
with
the
navigation
of
the
vessel
or
in
maritime
commerce.
it
wasn't
done
in
a
maritime
environment.
so
the
circuits
are
not
really
in
disarray
or
discord
as
to
the
applicability
of
minturn.
there
have
been
some
exceptions,
but
recent
cases,
even
justice
brown
in
the
fifth
circuit
again
restates
the
general
agency
rule
with--
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
--there
are
none.
it
follows
the
vessel.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
think
there
is
some
laches,
yes.
if
a
vessel
comes
into,
leaves
the
united
states
and
comes
back
five
times
and
you
don't
catch
it
here,
i
assume...
and
has
been
sold...
at
some
point
in
time
the
courts
can
apply
laches
to
it.
and
they
do,
have
done
it
at
times.
the
statute
of
limitations
also
would
apply.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
i
think
it
would
be
detrimental
to
that
area.
it
would
be
detrimental
in
commerce
in
general
because
you
would
create
a
whole
new
group,
just
if
we're
talking
agents
alone,
of
all
sizes,
types,
would
be
able
to
go
into
courts
now
and
to...
before
they...
go
into
courts,
and
seize
a
vessel
in
the
united
states,
wherever
it
is
in
the
united
states.
that
certainly
would
impede
commerce.
it
might
get
them
their
money,
but
it
would
impede
commerce.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
if
you
overrule
minturn
you're
still
going
to
have
the
vessel
seized
and
an
action
in
the
admiralty
courts,
and
then
you
would
have
the
sorting
out
of
the
preliminary
contract.
it's
not
a
question
of
bringing
an
action
and
sorting
it
out
and
seeking
if
you're
entitled
to
a
lien,
and
then
enforcing
the
lien.
in
this
instance
exxon
was
ready
to
seize
the
vessel.
everybody
knew
of
it
because
of
the
waterman
bankruptcy
and
a
side
arrangement
was
put
up.
typically
when
somebody
seizes
a
vessel,
the
vessel
will...
the
owner
will
bond
it
or
put
up
an
undertaking
of
some
sorts.
but
you're
still
having
this
continually...
somebody...
the
marshall
going
out
and
seizing
these
vessels
for
any
and
every
type
of
agent.
if
we
open
it
up
for
an
agent
we
have
the
passenger
agent.
we
open
it
up
for
the
cargo
brokers.
we
open
it
up
for
other
types
of
agents.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes,
your
honor,
if
we
limit
ourselves
to
the
statute.
but
in
this
instance
the
action
is
based
not
only
on
the
maritime
lien
act,
it's
based
on
traditional
maritime
law.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
yes,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
the
lien
act
in
and
of
itself
does
not
provide
for
a
maritime
lien
for
a
general
agent.
or
in
this
instance
a
preliminary
contract.
mr.
francis
a.
montbach
or
for
this.
specifically
not
this
agent,
your
honor,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honors.
