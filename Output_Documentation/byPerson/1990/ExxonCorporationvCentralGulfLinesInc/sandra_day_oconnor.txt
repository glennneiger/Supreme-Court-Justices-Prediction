justice
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
the
preliminary
contract
rule
adequate
for
differentiating
contracts
within
and
without
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
it
seems
to
have
been
employed
quite
extensively.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
kind
of
a
modification,
is
it,
of
that
preliminary
contract
rule.
now
here
you
have
a
contract
to
make
some
phone
calls
to
provide
fuel
in
bunkers.
how
is
that
a
maritime
contract,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
you
want
the
court
to
overrule
minturn,
but
i'm
curious
exactly
what
rule
you
would
have
us
adopt?
the
scholarly
writing
on
the
subject
suggests
several
different
ones,
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand
what
your
proposal
is.
anything
that
your,
would
enable
your
client
to
win,
or
do
you
have--
justice
o'connor
--a
more
specific
rule
in
mind?
justice
o'connor
now,
normally
someone
who
supplies
necessaries
to
a
vessel
in
reliance
on
the
credit
of
the
vessel
is
entitled
to
a
maritime
lien?
justice
o'connor
but
because
of
the
application
of
minturn
that
relief
is
denied
if
the
supplier
is
characterized
as
a
general
agent?
justice
o'connor
and
what
do
you
think
the
test
should
be?
you
started
to
say.
