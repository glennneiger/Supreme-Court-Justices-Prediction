chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
90-34,
the
exxon
corporation
v.
central
gulf
lines,
inc.--
mr.
pare.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
a
correct...
is
it
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
to
say
that
not
every
maritime
contract
action
gives
right...
gives
rise
to
a
maritime
lien?
chief
justice
rehnquist
nonetheless
admiralty
jurisdiction
would
entertain
that
sort
of
suit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pare,
you
say
some
agents
would
be
kept
out
by
your
rule,
the
general
agent
would
be
put
in.
what's
the
difference
between
the
general
agent
and
the
freight
forwarder
and
the
passenger
agent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
actually
how
a
general
agent
is
defined,
is
that
he
performs
services
that
are
essential
to
the
voyage?
or
is
that
simply
your
equation
of
the
two
things?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
the
general
agent
in
a
particular
case
did
not
provide
services
that
were
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
voyage,
would
that
part
of
the
general
agent's
services
nonetheless
be
subject
to
admiralty
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
fact
you
have
a
contract
of
general
agency
doesn't
get
you
an
admiralty
jurisdiction
automatically?
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
services
to
be
provided?
chief
justice
rehnquist
holding
of
minturn
that
general
agents
are
per
se
excluded
from
admiralty
jurisdiction.
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
minturn
we
know
that
general
agents
are
excluded
from
admiralty
jurisdiction.
does
it
follow
a
fortiori
from
that
case
that
freight
forwarders
and
passenger
agents
are
also
excluded
from
admiralty
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
your
position
would
be
that
you're
not
asking
us
to
move
admiralty
jurisdiction
outward
all
the
way
in
a
sense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
isn't
entirely
clear
to
me
that
you
have
even
raised
the
lien
question
in
your
questions
presented
for
certiorari.
it
seems
to
me
they
pertain
mostly
to
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pare.
mr.
nightingale,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
label
that
is
given
to
the
firm
that
is
allowed
to
recover
in
your
two
examples?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i'm
not
asking
what
the
test
should
be.
you
say
that
the
minturn
rule
produces
an
anomaly
because
two
people
doing
basically
the
same
thing
one
loses
and
the
other
wins.
what
is
the
doctrine
espoused
by
the
courts
which
let
the
second
person
win
under
the
minturn?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
person
lost.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
the
intervention
of
an
agent,
basically.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
montbach,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
used
the
term,
and
counsel
have
used
the
term
for
other
things...
agency
relationship.
agency
relationship
as
distinguished
from
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
someone
who
has
a
direct
contract
with
the
ship
or
the
ship's
owner?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
a
direct
juridical
contact
with
maritime
commerce
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
want
to
suggest
i
don't
know
what
juridical
means--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
i
don't
understand
what
the
phrase
means.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
bills
direct.
that
is
not
an
agent,
that
is
a
seller?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supplier.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
an
agent
is
someone
who
is
a
step
removed
from
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
montbach.
mr.
pare,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pare.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-34
exxon
corporation
versus
central
gulf
lines
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
