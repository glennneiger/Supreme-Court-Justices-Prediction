justice
marshall
mr.
barham,
in
a
diversity
case
suppose
a
lawyer
was
in
obvious
contempt
of
the
court.
would
the
court
be
denied
the
right
to
punish
him
because
it
was
a
diversity
case?
justice
marshall
but
isn't
it
true
that
once
the
lawyer
is
in
the
federal
court,
his
conduct
is
controlled
by
federal
and
not
state?
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
marshall
his
conduct--
justice
marshall
--in
the
presence
of
the
federal
court.
justice
marshall
thank
you.
justice
marshall
your
only
complaint
is
that
it
was
shifting
of
a
fee.
if
it
had
just
been
a
charge
of
that
amount
of
money
you
wouldn't
be
complaining.
justice
marshall
but
i
mean,
what's
the
magic
of
shifting
fees?
there's
no
magic
to
that.
you're
being
punished
for
doing
wrong.
justice
marshall
well,
if
you
give
the
same
amount
of
money,
and
says
in
the
order
this
is
not
a
shifting
of
fee,
would
you
have
a
complaint?
justice
marshall
if
the
fee
is
$15,000,
and
the
court
says
for
the
harm
that
you
have
done
by
your
misconduct
you
must
pay
$15,000,
but
this
is
not
a
shift
in
the
fees,
would
you
be
complaining?
justice
marshall
sir?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
then
you
wouldn't
be
complaining?
justice
marshall
well
then
you
would
just
complain.
[laughter]
but
you
concede
that
substantially
all
of
the
conduct
here
could
be
sanctionable
under
rule
11?
justice
marshall
is
there
any
case
you
can
give
us
which
says,
quote,
"rule
11
does
not
apply
in
diversity
cases.
"
end
quote?
justice
marshall
apply...
does
not--
justice
marshall
--do
you
have
any
case
that
says
rule
11
does
not
apply
to
diversity
cases?
justice
marshall
so
you
want
some
new
law?
