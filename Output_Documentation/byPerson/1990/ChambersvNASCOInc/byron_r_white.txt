justice
white
suppose
that,
suppose,
mr.
barham,
that
there
was
a
federal
statute
which
said
that
in
diversity
cases
the
federal
court
has
inherent
power
to
impose...
to
shift
attorneys'
fees
as
a
sanction
for
bad
faith
conduct
during
trial.
would
that
statute
be
invalid?
justice
white
well,
it's
an
erie
case,
diversity--
justice
white
--[inaudible]
it's
a
diversity
case,
i'd
say--
justice
white
--it's
a
diversity
case.
and
i
suppose
whatever
answer
you
give
to
that
question,
i
suppose
you
would
give
the
same
question
if
there
was
a
rule
of
court?
justice
white
well,
of
course,
the
famous
footnote
in
alyeska
said
that
where
a
state
law
that
does
not
run
counter
to
a
valid
federal
statute,
then
all
this
follows.
but
i
suppose
if
there
was
a
statute
like
that,
your...
what
you're
urging
would
be
counter
to
a
federal
statute,
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
it
was
valid.
justice
white
well,
you
would,
you
would
if
you
thought
it
was
just
a
procedural
housekeeping
matter.
justice
white
well,
that
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
white
are
you
defending
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
well,
they
said
that
rule
11
just
doesn't
replace
the
inherent
power
to
any
extent.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
could
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
presented
here
is
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
rule
11
and
inherent
power?
justice
white
you
don't
think
the
questions
presented
here
really
succeed
on
the
question
of
whether
rule
11
or
the
statute
limits
inherent
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
90-256,
chambers
against
nasco,
inc.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
souter
have
joined
justice
kennedy's
opinion.
