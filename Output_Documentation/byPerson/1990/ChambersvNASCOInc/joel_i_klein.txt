mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner
was
improperly
sanctioned
for
his
bad
faith
litigation
conduct.
we
submit
that
he
wasn't,
based
on
the
following
analysis.
first,
the
authority
to
impose
attorneys'
fees
for
abusing
the
court's
processes
is
clearly
on
of
the
several
inherent
sanctioning
powers
that
federal
courts
possess,
in
this
court's
words,
for
the
specific
purpose
of
managing
their
affairs
so
as
to
achieve
the
orderly
and
expeditious
disposition
of
cases.
second,
that
kind
of
sanctioning
power,
by
definition,
protects
core
judicial
process
concerns,
and
therefore
applies
in
diversity
cases
just
as
it
applies
in
all
other
cases.
and
third,
the
district
court
didn't
abuse
its
discretion
in
this
case
in
setting
the
amount
of
petitioner's
sanction
to
reflect
the
full
cost
of
respondent's
attorneys'
fees.
that
determination
properly
rested
on
the
factual
finding
that
petitioner's
entire
litigation
effort
was
designed
to
obstruct,
impede,
and
indeed
prevent
judicial
resolution
of
respondent's
claim
in
the
belief
that
through
fraud,
delay,
harassment,
and
increasing
legal
fees,
respondent
would
abandon
its
claim.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
points
that
i'd
like
to
say.
first
of
all,
i
would
agree
with
the
point
you
made
before,
that
is
if
this
conduct
was
all
sanctionable
under
rule
11
and
the
district
court
simply
invoked
the
wrong
rule,
then
i
think
the
case
ought
to
be
affirmed
on
that
basis.
i
will
suggest
to
you
why
i
think
the
court
thought
that
he
could
not,
and
that
is
i
think
there
has
been
some
dispute
among
the
circuits
about
just
how
far
rule
11
applies
in
terms
of
signings
and
parties,
also
in
terms
of,
for
example,
in
this
case
there
was
a
fabrication
of
a
fraud,
as
you
pointed
out
ahead
of...
in
the
other
argument,
there
is
a
fabrication
of
a
fraud
designed
to
mislead
and
abuse
the
court.
now,
in
that
situation
a
lot
of
events
occurred
that
were
in
some
respects
reflective
of
a
pleading,
but
not
necessarily.
and
so
i
think
the
court
was
simply
being
cautious,
given
the
fact
that
the
circuits
have
had
a
more
limited
view
of
rule
11,
and
i
would
suggest
the
majority
did
suggest
yesterday
that
rule
11
had
a
kind
of
discrete
power
analysis
rather
than
a
generic.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
my
understanding
of
it,
and
i
think
the
behavior
here
went
far
beyond
filed
papers.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is...
it
applies
to
particular
filings,
and
i
think
there
would
be
limits
on
what
the
court
could
have
awarded
here.
however,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
suggesting
that
something
close
to
this
award
isn't
sustainable
on
rule
11.
i
think
the
court
was
right
in
putting
it
on
the
power
that
he
did
have,
and
i
think...
and
i
think
that
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
pointing
out
that
i
think
this
court
and
certainly
the
circuit
courts
have
taken
a
more
limited
view
of
what
rule
11
is
addressed
to.
after
all,
it's
only
one
of
several
sanctions
in
the
course
of
the
entire
rules
directed
at
a
particular
phase
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
it
was.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
believe
he
did.
and
that's
what
i
think
the
essential
finding
is,
justice
scalia,
that
is
i
think
this
determination
rests
on
the
finding
that
the
whole
effort,
that
what
the
petitioner
set
out
to
do
is
to
say,
look,
when
we
go
to
court
we
are
going
to
tie
this
process
in
knots.
we
are
going
to
use
every
abusive
power.
by
the
time
they
sort
this
out
there
is
going
to
be
$1
million
worth
of
fees.
and
many
years
later,
this
guy
will
cave.
i
think
the
district
court
found
that,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it,
and
i
think
that
it
should
be--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
that's
what
i
was
suggesting,
i
thought,
before.
that
is,
i
think
the
consequences
of
what
rule
11
would
allow
you
to
recover
are
more
limited.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
want
to
say
two
points,
justice
scalia,
because
i
may
have
confused
at
first.
i
think
this
award
is
based
on
the
amount
of
fees
attributable
to
the
misconduct.
i
think
that's
what
the
district
court
found
and
clearly
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
whole--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
misconduct
before
the
court,
the
contempt
of
courts
that
were
held.
in
other
words,
it
was
misconduct
in
the
fcc,
but
that
was
in
contempt,
in
violation
of
the
court's
order.
everybody
recognized
that.
it
wasn't
that
those
were
extraneous
proceedings.
there
was
a
tro
that
was
outstanding
when
he
violated
it,
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
that
was
outstanding.
every
bit
of
this
behavior
was
not
for
the
purpose
that
courts
are
open
for,
and
that
is
to
resolve
legal
disputes.
every
bit
of
it
was
to
frustrate
and
thwart
the
court's
effort
at
doing
that.
he
litigated
for
3
years
over
a
series
of
counterclaims
and
affirmative
defenses.
on
the
eve
of
trial,
voluntarily,
after
this
whole
process,
he
stipulates
that
the
contract
was
valid,
that
he
had
no
defense
to
the
contract,
and
that
we
had
not
violated
the
contract.
that,
i
think,
is
the
essential
finding,
and
i
think
that's
the
basis
that
this
court
should
affirm
on.
now,
i
think
the
second
issue,
to
the
extent...
let
me
say,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
this
box.
if
rule
11
is
coextensive
with
this
inherent
power,
based
on
that
fact
finding,
then
i
think
i
am
perfectly
happy
to
have
the
court
rest
the
judgment
on
rule
11.
i
would
also
say
the
inherent
power,
if
it
awarded,
justice
scalia,
for
legitimate
fees,
that
is
it
didn't...
it
used,
so
to
speak,
a
sledge
hammer,
when
a
more
careful
approach
would
be
necessary,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
prudent
and
might
indeed
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
the
inherent
power.
so
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
box
of
trying
to
argue
which
particular
sanction,
because
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--let
me
answer
it
this
way.
first
of
all,
there
were
two
aspects
to
roadway,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
initial
aspect
was
the
inherent
sanctioning
power
against
parties.
that
was
what
the
court
built
upon
to
extend
to
attorneys.
now,
that...
then,
subsequent
to
that,
this
court,
congress,
as
you
point
out,
amended
1927
to
cover
parties.
and
i
would
say,
quite
frankly,
that
1927,
as
i
read
it,
is
coextensive
with
the
roadway
power
that
was
applied
to
attorneys.
however,
this
other
power
in
roadway,
which
i
think
traces
back
much
earlier,
for
example
to
chief
justice
taft's
opinion
in
toledo
scale,
that
power
congress
has
never
touched.
it
has
not
amended,
it
has
not
changed.
second,
the
court
is
also
clear
in
link
v.
wabash,
justice
harlan's
opinion,
he
says
when
congress
or
the
rulemakers
want
to
limit
or
eliminate
an
inherent
power,
one
that
this
court
has
recognized,
it
has
to
speak
with
unmistakable
clarity.
now,
congress,
certainly
in
passing
1927,
never
suggested,
never
suggested
that
it
was
attempting
to
divest
the
federal
courts
of
their
ability
to
sanction
parties;
1927
is
purely
attorneys.
and
second
of
all,
the
rulemakers,
when
they
amended
rule
11
in
1983,
flat
out
said
they
were,
quote,
"building
on
and
expanding"
the...
inherent
power
recognized
in
roadway.
so
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they
made
it...
they
imposed
a
higher
standard.
what
the
rulemakers
did
in
1983,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
they
said
under
the
inherent
power
you
need
to
have
a
showing
of
bad
faith,
subjective
bad
faith.
we
are
now
imposing
a
higher
standard
on
counsel,
and
as
the
court
has
found,
on
parties
to
require
more
of
an
objective.
that
was
what
the
rule
did.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
precisely.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
the
inherent
power,
i
think,
was
a
more
limited
one.
it
was
for,
frankly,
i
think,
the
concerns
that
were
articulated
in
the
opinion
yesterday.
that
is,
that
the
inherent
power
was
saying
if
you
act
in
bad
faith,
you
intentionally
misuse
the
processes
of
this
court.
the
court
needs
that
power
to
defend
itself,
to
protect
its
integrity
and
to
protect
its
processes.
that
is
the
scope
of
it.
that
was
what
was
applied
here.
now,
i
think
that's
unequivocal
in
roadway.
i
mean,
i
think
what
roadway
says,
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
key
to
the
holding,
that
there
are
inherent
powers
governed
not
by
rule
or
statute,
but
by
the
control
necessarily,
necessarily
vested
in
courts
to
manage
their
affairs.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
that's
the
power
we're
talking
about,
then
it
must
be
clear...
it
must
be
clear
it
applies
in
diversity
cases
just
as
it
does
in
all
other
federal
cases.
for
example,
the
conduct
that
was
condemned
in
roadway
itself,
those
abuses,
is
it
conceivable
that
the
court
would
have
said
that
they
were
not
sanctionable
in
a
case
that
was
based
on
1332
rather
than
1331?
that's
not
at
all
possible.
and
let
me
suggest
when
we're
dealing
with,
as
i
think
justice
marshall
pointed
out
before,
we're
dealing
with
the
court
running
its
business.
that
is
such
a
core
concern
that
it
seems
to
me,
even
if
a
state
thinks
that
a
different
set
of
powers
is
appropriate
in
its
court,
that
you
don't
need
this
power.
if
the
federal
courts
have
made
that
determination,
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest,
cognizable
under
erie
or
any
other
doctrine,
that
would
divest
the
federal
courts
of
that
power,
just
as
it
has
no
interest
that
would
allow
them
to
take
away
the
full
measure
of
contempt
power,
even
if
they
insisted
different
contempt
proceedings
were
held
in
their
courts,
or
the
power
recognized
in
link
v.
wabash
to
dismiss
a
case
sui
sponte,
even
if
they
had
a
different
view
in
their
courts.
now,
i
think
to
some
degree,
i
just
want
to
point
out
a
couple
of
other
quick
points
here,
but
i
think
petitioner
is
confusing
a
variety
of
different
powers,
and
i
will
be
the
first
to
concede
that
federal
courts
have
lots
of
powers
that
are
not
clearly
defined
either
by
statute
or
by
the
constitution,
for
example,
the
power
to
invoke
an
injunction
or
deny
an
injunction
in
an
equitable
case.
and
i
admit,
each
of
those
powers
presents
its
own
individual
erie
question.
but
i
would
suggest
that
while
some
of
those
powers
raise
complex
erie
questions,
a
power
that
this
court
has
found
as
a
fundamental
sanctioning
power
to
control
the
processes
presents
a
very
simple
erie
question.
and
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
has
amply
pointed
out,
i
don't
think
anything
in
alyeska
was
intended
to
detract
from
that
point
whatsoever.
petitioner's
reliance
on
alyeska,
it
seems
to
me,
confuses
two
very
different
bases
of
authority
for
directing
a
party
to
pay
fees.
one
is
to
impose
sanctions
on
an
abusive...
litigant.
that's
the
power
at
issue
in
this
case.
now
there
is
another
power,
and
that
is
a
power
to
shift
fees
to
a
prevailing
party,
having
nothing
to
do
with
whether
that
party
abused
the
process
or
not.
and
that
power
has
substantitive
impact
in
the
following
ways.
it
either
is
designed
to
bring,
encourage
bringing
certain
title
litigation,
or
frankly,
it
may
be
designed
to
discourage
certain
kind
of
conduct.
that
kind
of
power,
we
acknowledge,
is
probably
substantitive
under
erie,
and
that's
the
kind
of
power,
by
citing
the
sioux
city
case
in
this
footnote,
that
the
court
had
in
mind
in
alyeska.
alyeska
itself
had
nothing
to
do
with
judicial
sanctioning
powers.
alyeska
was
concerned,
pure
and
simple,
with
basic
prevailing
party
situations.
finally,
if
i
can
just
take
a
moment--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--with
respect--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i'll
disagree
with
that,
and
if
i
might
explain.
that
is
to
say,
it
is...
the
fact
that
gray
was
hired
by
chambers
didn't
lead
to
the
imposition
of
any
fees
in
and
of
itself
by,
to
our
client.
what
the
court
has
sanctioned
this
person
for
is
saying
look,
you
came
into
my
court,
the
first
thing
you
did
was
you
tried
to
defraud
me
by
suggesting
you
had
made
a
bona
fide
sale,
and
therefore
preventing
specific
performance.
that
didn't
happen.
that
was
a
fraud.
you
misled
me
and
you
misled
the
public.
you
registered
certain
recordation
papers
that
claim
to
be
a
cash
sale.
now,
everything
that
happened,
justice
scalia,
grew
out
of
that
process,
and
the
court's...
except
for
one
exception
which
i'll
come
to...
and
the
court's
basically
saying
in
that
situation
look,
we
understand
what
went
on
here.
you
never
showed
up
to
resolve
a
legal
claim.
it
didn't
happen.
you
showed
up
to
tie
this
process
in
knots.
i'm
not
going
to
tolerate
it.
the
one
exception
that
i
think
is
for
out-of-court
conduct
has
to
do
with
the
violations
of
the
orders.
that
is
to
say,
in
its
expanded
power,
if
he
goes
to
the
fcc
and
seeks
to
change
the
status
quo,
that
is
a
standard
contempt
remedy,
and
the
court
clearly
could
have
done
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
100
percent
of
the
fees
were
awarded
as
sanctions,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that
the
finding
was
that
chambers...
explicit
finding
that
chambers
was
the
engineer,
that
is,
he
was
the
strategist
and
the
lawyer
was
the
tactician.
and
that
is
to
say
there
may
be
individual
motions
that
were
filed,
defenses
that
were
raised,
that
were
designed
by
the
lawyers,
but
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
was
part
of
chambers'
overall
plan
to
misuse
this
litigation
to
delay,
harass,
and
impose
fees
on
our
client.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
your
honor--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
would
refer
the
court
further.
i
want
to
comment
to
that
specific
language,
but
i
would
refer
the
court,
on
page
a-51
he
says
the
sanctions
assigned
and
established
in
this--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--a-51
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
incompleted
paragraph.
the
sanctions
assigned
and
established
in
this
paragraph...
these
are
the
sanctions
against
chambers...
apply
only
to
sanctionable
acts
which
occurred
in
connection
with
proceedings
in
the
trial
court.
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
on
page
a-79,
it
says,
"finally
chambers
contends
the
amount
of
the
sanction
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
"
"we
disagree.
"
"nasco's
expenses
throughout
this
litigation
were
without
exception
the
product
of
chambers'
bad
faith
tactics.
"
"the
award
reflects
the
amount
of
these
expenses.
"
and
i
would
suggest
to
you,
justice
scalia,
he
could
have
sat
back
and
made
us
sue
him,
but
once
he
showed
up
in
court,
if
he
has
no
defenses
he
can't
defraud
the
court
and
he
can't
play
games
and
he
can't
manufacture
defenses.
that,
i
think,
is
the
difference.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree
with
that,
and
if
the
argument
is
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
deduct
the
cost
of
the
complaint,
i
really
don't
think
that,
under
these
circumstances,
given
the
pervasiveness
and
given
the
sanctioning
power...
it
is,
after
all,
a
deterrent
remedy,
not
a--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--but
i'd
like
to
discuss
that
with
you,
because
i
think
that
is
wrong,
and
i
think
the
record
couldn't
be
clearer
about
it.
and
the
reason
i
think
that's
wrong
is
he
starts
out...
let's
look
at
what
he...
what
took
these
proceedings
so
long.
he
starts
out
by
a
clear
fraud,
intentionally
designed
to
abuse
and
mislead
the
court.
that's
indisputable.
all
right,
that...
now,
then
we
have
2
years
of
discovery
on
affirmative
defenses,
okay,
as
well
as
on,
on
counterclaims
that
he
filed,
which
are
really
just
completely
manufactured.
they're
frivolous.
then
we
have
endless
motions
for
stays.
then
we
have
a
recusal,
we
finally
get
a
trial
date,
he
files
a
recusal
motion
before
the
district
court
mandamuses
him
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now
i
suggest
to
the
court,
what
went
on
that
was
the
business
of
the
litigation
in
this
2
year
process?
the
whole
time
he
is
doing
depositions,
he
takes
depositions
of
people
in
boston
about
whether
we
could
finance
the
deal
or
not.
the
whole
time
he
is
pursuing
his
counterclaims,
the
whole
time
that
he
is
pursuing
his
affirmative
defenses,
fees
are
running
up.
the
night
before
trial,
literally,
he
says
oh,
all
of
that
i
stipulate
away.
what's
left?
what's
his
whole
defense?
it's
his
fraudulent
defense,
which
the
fifth
circuit
found
was
so
offensive
that
they
affirmed
from
the
bench,
sanctioned
him,
and
described
his
conduct
as
manipulative.
that
was
the
only
issue
when
all
this
was
sorted
out,
and
none
of
the
other
issues,
none
of
the
other
issues
he
even
thought
were
meritorious
enough
to
proceed
to
trial.
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
everything
he
did,
and
i
think
that
finding
is
absolutely
safe
on
this
record,
everything
he
did
was
an
abuse
of
the
process.
i
think
his
strategy
was
clear,
and
it
almost
succeeded.
he
said
if
he
can
tie
these
guys
up
in
knots...
these
are
not
people
with
a
lot
of
means,
if
i
can
tie
them
up
in
knots,
they'll
cave,
they'll
give
in.
and
i
think
that's
intolerable,
and
i
thought
the
court
was
exactly
right
in
sanctioning
it.
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
it.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
absolutely.
that
is
what's
called
by
this
court
in
universal
oil,
perpetration...
a
perpetration
of
a
fraud
on
the
court,
and
that
is
what
this
was.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
guess
i
think
that
the
answer
in
part
to
that,
justice--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
it
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
parts
to
that.
that
is
if
rule
11,
as
i
said,
is
coextensive
with
this
power,
then
it's
not
necessary.
if
it's
not,
then
i
suggest
it
is,
because
there
are
abuses
that
will
go
unredressed.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
an
either/or.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
that's
correct...
and
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--but,
i
guess
what
i...
i
realize
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
reason
my
answer
is
less
than
clear
about
that,
your
honor,
frankly,
is
because
this
court
hasn't
ruled
on
those
kinds
of
issues
and
the
circuits
are
split.
that's
the
reason
why
my
answer
is
somewhat
unclear.
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
and
perhaps
i
haven't
put
this
properly,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
seems
to
me
rule
11
was
designed
for
a
more
narrow
purpose,
relating
primarily
to
pleadings,
and
that
it
was,
as
the
court
said
yesterday,
concerned
with
discrete
events.
there
are,
after
all,
sanctions
under
rule
56--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that
is
my
best
reading
of
it
at
this
point.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
was
not
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
am
defending
fully
the
rationale
of
the--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that
is
their
view.
i
happen
to
agree
with
their
view.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
if...
what
i'm
saying,
justice
white,
is--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
believe
that's
a
fairly
presented
question.
the
question
here
is
whether
he
had
the
power,
the
inherent
power.
i
think
the
answer
on
roadway
is
yes,
and
if
he
exercised
that
properly--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
question
is
very
broadly
presented.
i
wouldn't
say
the
court
was
barred
from
reaching
the
question,
based
on
the
question
that
is
presented,
but
i
think
it's
clear
rule
11
doesn't.
and
the
reason
i
think
it's
clear
is
because
the
rule
itself
expressly
states
it's
expanding
and
building
upon,
and
no
way
contracting.
and
it
seems
to
me
at
worst
the
two
powers
are
coextensive.
and
if
they
are,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
acted
entirely
properly
in
placing
it
on
the
inherent
power
rather
than
rule
11.
if
the
two
powers
are
not
coextensive,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
inherent
power,
being
broader,
is
necessary
in
the
sense
that
this
court
found
it
necessary
in
roadway.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
