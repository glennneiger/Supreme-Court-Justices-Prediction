mr.
mack
e.
barham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this,
or
the
issues
for
this
court
arise
out
of
a
suit
for
a
specific
performance
for
breach
of
a
contract
in
a
federal
court
in
louisiana.
a
louisiana
resident
owned
a
television
station
in
lake
charleston,
louisiana,
and
it
was
a
contract
to
purchase
on
that
station.
there
was
a
nonresident
purchaser,
and
that
nonresident
purchaser
filed
suit
in
federal
court
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
to
enforce,
by
specific
performance,
the
contract.
the
louisiana
civil
code
provides
for
the
concepts
of
breach
of
contract,
and
also
for
the
remedies
for
breach
of
contract,
including
specific
performance
or
damages,
or
specific
performance
and
damages,
or
specific
performance
with
delay
damages.
the
damages
in
louisiana
are
economic
damages.
we
do
not
have
punitive
damages,
and
the
only
damages
allowed
are
for
economic
loss.
they...
louisiana
prohibits
attorneys'
fees
unless
they
are
specially
provided
for
either
in
the
legislation
or
in
the
contract,
and
neither
were
provided
here.
and
louisiana
does
not
have
any
acceptance
of
the
bad
faith
exception
to
the--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--the
only
ones,
your
honor,
are
the
ones
that
are
in
the
higher
tiers,
like
contempt,
those
kind
of
inherent
powers
which
have,
as,
you
know,
generally
across
the
country
they
have
been
put
into
legislative
form.
but
it's
that
high
tier
of
inherent
power
that
is
recognized,
and
that
only.
not
the
necessary...
useful,
in
the
sense
of
useful.
only
those
necessary
for
the
court
to
carry
out
its
functions.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
the
louisiana
state
court
could,
under
its,
the
fact
that
all
lawyers
are
in
an
integrated
bar
and
therefore
the
court
rules
the
lawyers,
they
could
take
care
of
the
lawyers
under
that
power
that's
given
to
them
as
a
court.
they
could
take
care
of
them
under
a
criminal
charge
referral.
they
could
take
care
of
them
under
contempt
or
a
fine.
they
do
not
have
a
fee
shifting.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
we
have
no
cases--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--under
the,
under
the
contempt...
i
don't
believe,
i
don't
believe
louisiana
has
that
power.
i
question
even
whether
the
fine
for
contempt
could
carry
with
it,
even
under
federal
law,
i
would
have
to
say
i
question
even
whether
it
could
carry
attorneys'
fees
that
were
attendant
upon
the
fine
in
federal
law.
but
we
do
not
recognize
the
bad
faith
exception
for
shifting
attorneys'
fees,
and
we
do--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--yes.
under
diversity,
not
under
a
federal
question.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
no.
i
say
that
it
has
inherent
powers,
and
those
have
been
defined
in
alyeska.
justice
white
discussed
the
inherent
power
in
question
about
a
pot
to
be
divided--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--but
you
have
also
said
very
clearly
in
alyeska
that
not
for
that...
not
in
diversity.
that's
the
footnote--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--yes.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
well,
i
read
it
as
in
an
ordinary
diversity
case
where
the
state
law
does
not
run
counter
to
a
valid
federal
statute
or
rule
of
court,
a
state
denying
the
right
to
attorneys'
fees,
which
reflects
a
substantial
policy
of
the
state,
should
be
followed.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
well,
may
it
please
your
honor,
it
is
a
footnote
to
an
exception
to
the
general
american
rule
against
fee
shifting,
which
is
the
bad
faith
exception,
which
means
bad
faith,
vexatious
conduct,
during
litigation.
so
if
it's
attached
to
that
footnote,
i
would
assume
justice
white,
speaking
for
the
court,
intended
that
that
would
be
a
meaning
carried
down
into
that
footnote,
which
is
very
clear
and
plain
and
goes
on
to
say
the
same
would
clearly
hold
for
a
judicially
created
rule,
which
is
the
inherent
power.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
no.
there
are
so
many
ways
to
punish
him.
you
now
have,
i
believe
there
are
12
sanctions
in
the
rules.
there
is
28,
for
the
lawyer
there
is
28
1927.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
the
conduct--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--yes.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
would
have
to
agree,
it
is.
it
is.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
in
this
case
the...
we
went
through
the
merit
trial.
there
was
a
judgment
for
specific
performance.
the
fifth
circuit
set
this
for
argument,
and
in
the
midst
of
arguments
set
the...
placed
the
lawyers
at
ease
and
immediately
imposed
sanctions
for
a
frivolous
appeal.
in
the
whole
process
of
the
merit
trial
there
was
one
sanction
imposed,
and
that
was
a
contempt
sanction
for
violation
of
an
order
of
court
imposed
on
the
client.
that
was
an
area
part
of
the
proceeding,
it
went
2
years
and
nothing
else
happened.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
they
would
hold
double
cost
and
attorneys'
fees
as
sanctions
for
the
frivolous
appeal,
and
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
saying
would
you
look
for
casting
costs
or
attorneys'
fees
under
rule
11,
on
the
client
and
attorneys
are
under
28
u.s.c.
1927
for
the
attorneys.
and
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court...
before
we
got
to
that
there
was
a
motion
to
indicate
some
of
the
extent
of
damages
in
this
case
which
are
not
really
permitted
except
for
economic,
there
was
a
motion
for
assistance
before
we
got
to
the...
to
this
motion.
and
the
district
court
in
that
motion
for
assistance
ordered
$2
million
worth
of
assets,
equipment
that
had
been
added
to
the
television
station
since
the
list
was
made
up
for
what
would
be
transferred,
to
also
be
transferred
for
the
same
consideration.
then
nasco,
the
respondent,
urged
the
court
to
reject
rule
11
and
reject
28
1927,
and
to
go
to
the
inherent
power.
and
that
court
said
we
find
and
agree
with
the
parties
to
this
sanctioning
proceeding...
that's
nasco...
that
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
11
does
not
furnish
a
basis
for
the
consideration
of
the
sanctionable
acts
alleged
by
nasco.
we
find
that
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
11
for
the
levying
of
sanctions
at
this
time,
at
the
time
of
the
appellate
court's
decree
on
august
6th,
1986,
and
at
the
time
of
the
acts
themselves
were
committed,
to
be
insufficient
for
our
purposes
here.
so
what
happened
is
you
have
them
rejecting
any
conduct
that
could
be
sanctioned
under
11,
and
none
was
sanctioned
under
11
during
the
proceedings,
and
none
was
sanctioned
under
1927
during
the
proceedings.
it
was
only
after
the
court
of
appeal
jogged
the
mind
of
the
district
court
judge
that
you
may
impose
sanctions
that
it
came
into
being.
and
almost
2
years
later,
that's
after
the
appeal,
those
sanctions
were
imposed.
and
what
happened
is
one
lawyer
was
disbarred
for
3
years,
one
lawyer
was
suspended
for
5
years,
one
for
6
months,
and
they
are
not
before
this
court.
and
then
$1
million
of
attorneys'
fees,
more
or
less,
were
imposed
on
the
client,
given
to
the
movant.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
that's
what
you
were
kind
of
considering
yesterday,
and
we
got
copies
of
this
opinion.
when
you're
looking
under
the
rules
of
the
enabling
act,
you
know,
that's,
to
me,
different--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--it's
an
erie
case
whether
it's
under
the
rule
or
whether
it's
under
a
statute
or
what.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
yes,
sir.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
yes,
sir.
first
you'd
have
to
examine
is
the
rule
within
the
enabling
act,
or
is
the
rule
constitutional.
that's
the
only
thing.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
think
that's
what
you
would
have
to,
to
look
to,
and
i
don't
believe
you
would
hold
that
valid.
my
understanding
of
this
court's
approach
to
the
rules--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--well,
procedural
housekeeping
is
hardly
what
you
said
is
applicable
to
fee
shifting
when
that's
state
policy.
that
is
state
policy,
that
we
don't
believe
that
people
should
pay
other
people's
attorneys'
fees.
we
believe
that's
a
cost
of
doing
business,
and
we
don't
agree
that
other
persons
ought
to
be
made
to
pay
attorneys'
fees.
it
makes
coming
to
court
less
desirable.
it
has
a
chilling
effect.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
if
you
pay
that
into
the
court,
i
only
can
question
the
amount.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
can't
question
your
power.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
if
it's
under
contempt,
i
don't
know
that
what...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
agree
that
i
would,
i
would
not
have
to
argue
against
that.
the
fee
shifting
is
what
bothers
me,
because
there
is
such
a
very
strong
policy
consideration,
not
only
in
louisiana
but
in
most
states
against
fee
distribution
by
a
court.
it
is
determined
by
either
the
legislation
or
the
parties
themselves
if
there
is
going
to
be
fee
shifting.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
well,
it's
also
outcome
involved
because
only
the
loser
is
going
to
get
this
fee
shift.
only
the
loser.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
well,
but
it
does
run
counter
to
that
outcome
look
under
erie.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
don't
believe
you
can
shift--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--that
is
not
the
concept
of
the
equity
power,
the
equity
inherent
power
for
shifting
fees.
the
concept
is
that
you
make
whole
the
party
who
is
the
victor,
so
the
loser
always
pays,
the
victor
pockets.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
if
you
don't
use
one
of
the
rule
powers,
which
are
so
numerous
now
and
cover
every
piece
of
conduct...
in
fact
despite
the
statement
by
the
court,
if
you
read
what
he
enumerates
is
the
conduct,
it
could
have
been
sanctioned
at
the
time
under
rule
11,
but--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--well,
almost...
litigation
begins,
proceeds,
the
discovery,
everything
is...
was
signed
pleadings
in
this
case
as
in
every
other
case.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
would
be
complaining,
but
if
you
did
it
under
your--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--there
is
a
general
american
rule
which
says
it
is
wrong
to
shift
fees.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
if...
if
it's
going
to
be
contempt--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--is
it
going
to
be
paid
to
the
court?
mr.
mack
e.
barham
is
it
going
to
be
paid
to
the
court?
mr.
mack
e.
barham
then
i
have...
i
cannot
complain.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i'd
complain
about
the
amount.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
this
court
could
have
sanctioned,
if
it
thought
it
necessary,
any
time.
this
court
never
lost
control
of
this
case.
this
court
had
full
control
throughout
the
proceedings,
and
it
carried
it
through
to
the
very
end
without
any
difficulty
whatsoever.
it
was
only
when
the
court
of
appeal
imposed
the
frivolous--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--all
right.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
have
to...
i
have
to
take
back...
if
i
said
that,
i
have
to
take
it
back
to
this
extent.
much
of
the
conduct
was
pretrial,
prepetition
conduct
as
is
discussed
by
the
court,
then--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--there
is
some
litigation--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--yes,
sir.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
then
litigation
conduct,
yes.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
yes.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
i
have
trouble
with
a
district
court
rejecting
your
federal
rule
and
reaching
for
inherent
powers
because
the
rule
11
says--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--well,
in
your
dissent
yesterday
you
had
trouble
with
even
the
discrete
pact
shifting
of
attorneys'
fees,
and
this
is--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--but
this
was
not
a
discrete
act.
this
was
a
massive
imposition
of
an
amount
of
money,
not
accountable
act
by
act
by
act
by
act.
i
don't
know
what
i
got
wrong.
there
was
no
deterrence,
there
was
no
flag
waving
anytime
during
this,
like
your
rules
are,
to
say
don't
do
this
and
if
you
do
i
will
punish
because
you
didn't
see
the
flag.
what
we
have
is
punishment
for
punishment's
sake.
we
have
a
vindication,
if
you
will,
or...
it
is
totally
without
regard
to
the
deterrence
upon
future
litigants
or
attorneys,
or
even
upon--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--well
now,
mr....
when
there
was
a
publication
of
some
article
in
regard
to
sanctions
he
called
it
to
the
attention
of
counsel,
is
my
understanding.
when
a
mr.
mccabe
from
massachusetts
came
in
and
was
not
associated
with
counsel
before
he
got
into
the
courtroom,
he
was
somewhat
lectured
and
then
told
that
his
conduct
would
have
to
be
up
to
par,
but
he
had
not
even
been
there
before.
i'm
trying
to
think
of
another
instance...
that's
all
i
can
think
of,
other
than
the
one
instance
of
the
contempt
for
violation
of
an
order.
and
what
is
so
befuddling
to
me
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
trial
did
not
disturb
the
judge
until
it
was
over.
it
went
to
its
conclusion
fairly
well,
and
he
never
had
need
for
this.
when
he
ordered
something,
it
happened.
when
they
were
at
the
fcc
and
he
told
them
to
not
be
at
the
fcc,
they
removed
themselves.
order
is
all
that
he
needed.
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
least
that
you
have
to
do
to
control
a
court
is
the
most
effective
control,
and
the
more
quickly
you
control
the
court
and
that
you
keep
it
in
order,
the
better
order
you
have.
there
is
no
order
in
court
when
you
only
tell
them
after
court
is
through,
you
did
wrong.
it
is
the
manner
in
which
you
conduct
the
court
during
the
trial,
during
the
argument,
during
the
hearing,
which
is
conducive
to
the
good
conduct
and
accord.
and
that's
why
the
rules
generally
say
it
must
be
timely,
and
you
say
it
has
to
be
the
discrete,
or
that
act--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--i
believe
what
it...
what
do
though
is
we
say
i
hold
you
in
contempt,
but
you
wait
to
impose
that
contempt,
put
penalty,
fine,
or
other.
but
i
think
you
give
notice.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
yes,
sir.
it's
the
penalty.
it's
not
that...
i
want
you
to
know
you
passed
the
red
flag
in
my
court,
you're
in
contempt.
but
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
impose
the
penalty
then.
that
would
be...
it's
time
consuming.
it's
much
like
this
breeding
of
a
lot
of
different
litigation
when
you
go
into
this
inherent
power
and
you
have
no
restrictions
on
it.
i
say,
one,
that
in
a
diversity
case
you
can't
have
it.
i
say,
two,
you
can't
have
this
kind,
you
wouldn't
permit
this
kind
of
sanction...
not
a
sanction,
you
wouldn't
permit
this
kind
of
fee
shifting.
there
is
no
rule
to
permit
it.
the
rule
is
against
this
fee
shifting.
the
general
american
rule
says
you
don't
shift
fees,
and
yesterday
you,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority,
discussed
very
much
the
interference
with
the...
the
whole
procedure
and
all
the
things
that
happen
from
it.
your
dealing
with
alyeska,
if
it
please
your
honor,
was
that
we
don't
have
to
apply
alyeska,
look
to
it
here,
because
that
was
under
the
court's
inherent
power,
not
the
rule's
enabling
act.
and
then
you
found
three
reasons
that
it
did
not
constitute
a
kind
of
fee
shift
at
issue
in
alyeska,
and
one,
it
was
not
tied
to
the
outcome
of
that
litigation,
and
two,
it
did
not
shift
the
entire
cost
to
get
litigation,
only
for
the
discrete
event.
and
then
finally,
it
wasn't
necessarily
a
fee
shifting
statute.
it
wasn't,
because
it
had
no...
movant
had
no
entitlement
to
fees
or
other
sanction,
explained
in
cooter
v.
gell
in
citing
that.
then,
what
i
understand,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
any
mechanism
for
redistributing
cost,
even
the
inherent
sanctioning
authority
of
the
federal
court
has
the
potential
to
affect
decisions
concerning
whether
and
where
to
file
suit.
if
we
get
to
there,
we
can't
get
past
erie.
you
cannot
use
the
inherent
power
in
an
erie
case.
you
can't
use
it
in
a
rules
of
decision
case.
whether
you
can
do
it
under
the
enabling
act,
i
have
my
problems,
but
i
don't
have
to
address
that
because
we
have
no
rules
here.
you
have
a
judge-made
law,
and
that
law
comes
peculiarly
from
almost
nowhere,
out
of
the
atkinson
case
which
did
deal
and
own
up
and
finally
is
inherent
power.
but
i
do
not
say
there
is
not
inherent
power,
and
this
court
doesn't
need
inherent
power.
it
does
not
need
this,
nor
can
a
federal
court
sitting
in
louisiana,
texas,
or
wherever,
if
they
don't
have
fee
awarding,
a
federal
court
can't
make
a
decision
like
this,
which
is
outcome
dictating,
a
million
dollars'
worth
of
sanction,
when
a
court
across
the
street,
sitting
as
a
state
court
could
not
do
the
same.
and
if
that
won't
take
in
forum
shopping,
if
that
won't
be
an
inequitable
practice--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--rule
11
does--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--does
apply.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
no,
sir.
and
in
fact--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--no,
sir.
rule
11,
as
i
understand
it,
does
apply
in
diversity
because
it,
it
fits
the
category
of
everything
i'm
saying.
it's
not
this
kind
of
inherent
power.
it
is
not
a
fee
shifting.
it
is
taking
care
of...
it's
sanctions.
it's
deterrence.
this
was
not
deterrence.
this
was
not
sanctions.
this
was
punitive,
retributive.
i
suggest
there's
a
difference.
rule
11,
i
believe,
applies
in
diversity
cases,
as
it
has
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
i
don't
think
you'll
have
a
problem
applying
it,
as
you
enunciated
it
yesterday.
mr....
justice
kennedy,
you
went
on
to
say
that
it's
not
the
business
of
this
court
to
proscribe
rules
redistributing
litigation
costs
in
a
manner
that
discourages
good
faith
attempts
to
vindicate
rights
granted
by
substantive
law.
and
the
allocation
of
costs
accruing
from
litigation
is
a
matter
for
the
legislature,
not
the
courts.
our
potential
incursion
into
matters
reserved
to
the
states
also
counsel--
mr.
mack
e.
barham
--well,
he
didn't.
he
didn't,
but
he
is
quoting
a
fear
that
i
think
every
member
of
the
court,
including
the
majority,
did
have
a
feel
for.
i
don't
believe
the
majority
was
disregarding
a
thought,
does
this
have
any
incursion
on
the
states,
and
as
an
enunciated
rule,
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
rule
11
being
applied
in
the
diversity
case.
thank
you.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
yes.
mr.
mack
e.
barham
quickly.
in
regard
to
the
rules,
not
only
rule
11,
11,
16(f),
26(g),
30(g)(1)
and
(2),
37(a),
37(b),
37(b)(1)
and
(2),
37(c),
on
and
on
are
rules
that
govern
conduct.
and
in
this
case
the
rules
were,
by
the
fifth
circuit,
said
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
inherent
power.
you
don't
have
to
use
the
rules.
sit
back.
they
don't
have
to
mitigate.
let
them
sit
back
and
let
them
amass
attorneys'
fees
and
waste
the
court's
time,
then
hit
him.
hit
him
with
inherent
power.
and
that's
just
not
the
way
the
game
should
be
played
in
this
court,
not
the
way
the
rules
envision
it,
not
the
way
this
court
envisions
it.
moreover,
there
is
not
one
fact
in
the
entire
record
that
chambers
designed
a
fraud
upon
the
court.
it's
a
conclusion
that
he
participated
in
everything
and
in
the
design,
but
the
only
fact
is
his
statement
that
i
didn't
want
to
sell.
i
thought
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
public
and
me
not
to
go
through
with
it.
i
was
willing
to
pay
damages.
i
asked
lawyers,
can
i
pay
damages
and
not
sell.
the
lawyers
said
yes,
and
they
devised
the
plan,
and
i
questioned
the
plan.
i
thought
it
might
be
a
legal
trick,
but
they
persuaded
me.
and
must
have
persuaded
him
pretty
good
because
he
kept
running
his
business
at
the
tune
of
an
extra
$2
million
investment
over
the
time
of
the
litigation.
the
other
thing
is
they
wait
3
years
to
even
bring
their
motion
for
sanctions
after
the
court
of
appeals
said
do
it.
