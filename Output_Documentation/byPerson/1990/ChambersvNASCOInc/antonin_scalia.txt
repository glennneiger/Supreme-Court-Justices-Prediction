justice
scalia
why,
why
is
it
that
only
the
loser
will
ever
get
it?
don't
you
think
that
a
winner,
in
the
course
of
winning
could
have--
justice
scalia
--could
have
been
so...
could
have
had
such
outrageous
conduct
that
the
court
can...
which
causes
additional
expenses
to
the
other
side,
even
though
he
wins,
and
the
court
can
say,
you
know,
in
the
course
of
getting
there
you
violated
the
rules?
justice
scalia
but
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
maybe
we're
not
talking
about
that
power.
maybe
we're
talking
about
some
different
power,
which
is
the
power
of
the
court
to
protect
itself
from
being
imposed
on
by
the
parties,
to
protect
its
processes.
justice
scalia
what
if
rule
11
only
applies
to
signed
pleadings?
rule
11
applies
to
signed
pleadings.
justice
scalia
mr.
klein,
there's
another
problem
besides
the
fact
that
rule
11
only
applies
to
particular
filed
papers.
there
is
also
the
problem
that,
as
i
read
rule
11,
there
has
to
be
some
assessment
of
how
much
harm
the
particular
filing
caused
to
the
other
side,
and
the
award
here
was
all
the
attorneys'
fees,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
did
the
court
seek
to
calculate
what
incremental
additional
attorneys'
fees
were
caused
by--
justice
scalia
--well,
they
might
have
had
that
in
mind,
but
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
this
amount
of
damage
was
caused
by
these
particular
abuses.
they
might
have
wanted,
you
know,
had
willfully
in
mind
to
run
up
attorneys'
fees
through
abuses
and
through
nonabuses.
but
what
rule
11
says
is
that
it
can,
an
order
to
pay
the
other
party
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
expenses
incurred
because
of
the
filing,
not
all
attorneys'
fees.
justice
scalia
why
don't
we...
why
shouldn't
we
take
rule
11
as
being
a
limitation
upon
the
way
the
more
general
discretion
of
the
court
to
impose
costs.
you
acknowledge
the
court,
or
you
assert
that
the
court
has
an
inherent
power.
if
it
does,
why
shouldn't
we
think
that
that
inherent
power
has
been
limited
by
rule
11--
justice
scalia
--so
that
you
can't
shift
fees,
but
you
can
only
require
the
other
side
to
pay
the
amount
of
the
fees
that
are
attributable
to
the
misconduct?
justice
scalia
the
misconduct
before
the
court?
justice
scalia
mr.
klein,
before
you
get
to
that,
because
it
relates
to
the
point
you
have
been
talking
about,
as
i
read
the
district
court
opinion
which
calculated
the
amount
of
this
award,
much
of
that
was
not
only
not
based
upon
how
much
specific
harm
had
been
caused,
but
it
was
not
even
entirely
based
upon
conduct
before
the
court.
as
i
read
the
district
court
opinion,
part
of...
part
of
what
they
say,
it's
page
51
of
the
appendix,
chambers
and
gray...
chambers,
knowing
that
nasco
had
a
good
and
valid
contract,
hired
gray
to
find
a
defense
and
arbitrarily
refused
to
perform.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
there,
some
of
these
sanctions
are
indeed
the
substantive-type
sanctions
you
are
talking
about--
justice
scalia
--at
the
district
court
level,
anyway.
justice
scalia
mr.
klein,
i'm
not
sure
the
district
court's
statement
at
least
bears
the
reading
you're
giving
it.
i
mean,
the
district
court
says
that
the
full
amount
of
$996,000--
--where
are
you
reading
from?
it's
from
a-52,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
says
that
the
full
amount
is
$996,000.
this
sum
is
exclusive,
and
does
not
include
fees
and
expenses
awarded
by
the
court
in
the
contempt
proceedings.
okay.
it
does
include,
however,
$53,000
in
attorneys'
fees
and
expenses
paid
by
nasco
for
services
rendered
in
connection
with
the
sanctions
portion
of
this
suit.
this
latter
portion
of
the
fees
and
expenses,
the
district
court
says,
like
the
balance
of
such
fees
and
expenses
included
in
the
sanctions...
like
the
balance...
would
not
have
been
incurred
by
nasco
if
chambers
had
not
defaulted
and
forced
nasco
to
bring
this
suit.
justice
scalia
now,
what
he's
saying,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
chambers
is
a
bad
actor.
he
knew
he
didn't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
the
contract
and
he
forced
the
thing
to
go
to
litigation.
that's...
that's
not
the
contempt
type
of
a
sanction
that--
justice
scalia
but
you
have
to
pay
the
lawyer
at
least
50
bucks
for
showing
up
to
move
for
summary
judgment.
i
mean,
you've
got
to
subtract
something.
you're
clearly
penalizing
him
for
forcing
a
lawsuit
to
be
filed.
he's
entitled
to
force
a
lawsuit
to
be
filed.
he
only
has
to
be
an
honest
man
once
he
gets
before
the
court,
as
far
as
sanctions
are
concerned.
justice
scalia
but
the
omission
of
that,
you
know,
it
suggests
that
the
court
wasn't,
didn't
have
its
eye
on
the
ball.
it
isn't
just
the
$50
i'm
worried
about.
it
casts
the
whole
sum
into,
into
doubt.
