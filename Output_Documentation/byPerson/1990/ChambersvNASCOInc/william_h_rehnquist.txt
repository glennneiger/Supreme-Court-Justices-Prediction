chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-256,
g.
russell
chambers
v.
nasco.
mr.
barham,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what,
mr.
barham,
if
the
court
had
simply
held
your
client
in
contempt
and
fined
him
this
amount
of
money,
and
said
i'm
going
to
fine
you
an
amount
equivalent
to
the
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
is--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
what...
even
if...
what
if
it
were
done
as
a
form
of
civil
contempt,
where
you
would
presumably
pay
the
money
to
the
other
side?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
isn't
fee
shifting,
as
i
understand
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
here,
or
the
district
court,
simply
because
you
have
lost
a
case,
in
the
english
tradition
of
fee
shifting.
this
is
fee
shifting,
if
that's
what
you
call
it,
because
of
very
bad
behavior
during
the
course
of
litigation.
don't
you
see
some
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
great
majority
of
losers
won't
get
it,
only
losers
who
behave
the
way
your
client
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
don't
at
least
some
of
our
cases
dealing
with
contempt
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
during
a
trial
say
that
it's
better
for
the
court
to
perhaps
wait
until
the
trial
is
over
rather
than
just
do
it
instantaneously,
kind
of
perhaps
in
the
heat
of
passion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
defer
the
penalty?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
that
point
of
view
didn't
carry
the
day
yesterday.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
your
time,
mr.
barham?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
rule
11
certainly
is
basically
limited
to
filed
papers,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if,
if
the
court
below
had
been
limited
to
rule
11
it
could
not
have
imposed
the
extensive...
the
extent
of
sanctions
that
it
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
klein,
i
think
perhaps
you
ought
to,
because
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
to
you
was
why
doesn't
rule
11
limit
inherent
power.
my
question
to
you
is
take
a
look
at
section
1920...
1927.
in
june
of
1980
this
court
decided
in
roadway
that
1927
did
not
extend
to
the
imposition
of
attorneys'
fees.
in
september
of
1980
congress
comes
along
and
says...
and
amends
1927,
and
says
yes,
it
does.
now,
was
that
just
brutum
fulmen
on
the
part
of
congress?
i
mean,
could
congress...
could
the
court
have
done
whatever
it
wanted
under
inherent
powers
anyway?
i
think
inherent
powers
may
disappear
as
congress
steps
in,
or
as
the
rules
committee--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--if
the
power
was
already
there,
why
did
the
rulemakers
fuss
with
it
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
inherent
power
only
went
to
one
state
of
mind.
to
get
to
another
state
of
mind
you
had
to
have
legislation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
strange
definition
of
inherent
power.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--whereabouts
on
a-51?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
mr.
barham,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
barham.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
