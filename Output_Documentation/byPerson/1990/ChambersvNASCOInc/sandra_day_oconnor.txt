justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
barham,
does
louisiana
recognize
any
inherent
right
of
a
trial
court
judge
to
impose
sanctions
on
parties
for
conduct
of
litigation?
justice
o'connor
well,
this
case,
of
course,
was
tried
in
federal
court.
justice
o'connor
right.
and
you
take
the
position
that
the
federal
court
has
no
inherent
powers
to
control
what
goes
on
in
the
litigation
in
its
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
haven't
we
said
in
alyeska
and
roadway
effectively
that
a
federal
court
has
inherent
power
to
impose
monetary
sanctions
for
bad
faith
litigation
in
its
court?
justice
o'connor
you
mean
footnote,
the
footnote,
the
famous
footnote?
justice
o'connor
well,
aren't
you
reading
something
into
that
footnote
that
might
not
be
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
doesn't
that
just
mean
in
an
ordinary
fee
shifting
situation
where
you
have
to
determine
whether
a
cause
of
action
carries
with
it
fee
shifting
in
attorneys'
fees,
and
the
state
doesn't
allow
it,
we're
not
going
to
impose
it
in
federal
court
sitting
in
diversity.
what
does
that
footnote
have
to
do
with
any
inherent
power
situation
of
the
federal
court
to
control
bad
practices
going
on
in
its
courtroom?
i
don't
see
that
that
footnote
has
anything
to
do
with
that.
justice
o'connor
i
thought...
i
thought
in
this
record
it
disclosed
that
the
district
court
gave
notice
at
several
times
during
the
proceedings
that
sanctions
were
being
contemplated
if
certain
behavior
continued.
justice
o'connor
mr.
klein,
if
a
court's
inherent
power
is
limited
by
the
necessity
to
protect
itself,
and
if
a
court
has
available
to
it
sanctions
under
rule
11
that
cover
at
least
a
portion
of
this
conduct,
why
should
we
not
require
the
court
to
at
least
determine
what
of
this
conduct
is
covered
by
rule
11?
justice
o'connor
because
i'm
not
sure...
only
then
do
we
know
whether
it's
necessary
to
resort
to
inherent
power,
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
we
don't
know.
apparently
the
district
court
did
not
take
up
the
fifth
circuit
on
its
suggestion
that
it
sort
out
what
could
be
sanctioned
under
rule
11.
justice
o'connor
it
didn't
do
that.
so
we
don't
know,
really.
justice
o'connor
and
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
be
very
clear
in
telling
us
whether
every
single
dollar
imposed
here
could
have
been
imposed
under
a
rule
11
sanction.
justice
o'connor
well,
so
your
best
reading
of
rule
11
is
to
the
effect
that
it
did
not
cover
all
the
conduct
here?
