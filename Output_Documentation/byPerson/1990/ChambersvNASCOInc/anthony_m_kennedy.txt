so,
so
if
an
attorney
knowingly
introduced
perjured
testimony
or
falsified
documents
in
a
louisiana
state
court,
the
louisiana
state
court
could
impose
monetary
sanctions?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
they
could
impose
monetary
sanctions,
i
take
it,
measured
by
the
amount
of
the
attorneys'
fees
incurred
by
the
injured
party,
under
your--
justice
kennedy
--under
your
first
inherent
power
explanation?
justice
kennedy
well,
set
that
aside.
justice
kennedy
well,
it
began--
justice
kennedy
--it
was
the
friday,
saturday,
sunday
conduct
that
led
up
to
a
pleading--
justice
kennedy
--that
was
filed
in
the
following
week.
justice
kennedy
and
i
think
you
were
correct
to
say
that
this
is
within
the
ambit
of
rule
11.
justice
kennedy
well,
then
why
can't
we
just
affirm,
based
on
the
fact
that
it...
the
judge
could
have
made
these
findings
under
rule
11?
justice
kennedy
well,
we'll
say
he's
right
in
finding
that
there
was
wrongful
conduct,
he
just
found
the
wrong
rule.
rule
11
would
have
served
just
fine,
and
so
we
affirm,
or
at
least
remand
it
and
tell
him
to
impose
a
sanction
under
rule
11
if
he
chooses.
justice
kennedy
but
you
don't
need
to
have
that
trouble
because
the
majority
opinion
ruled
to
the
contrary.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
at
some
point
during
your
argument,
mr.
klein,
perhaps
we
could
discuss
or
you
could
tell
me
why
the
district
court
couldn't
have
done
all
of
this,
or
substantially
all
of
it,
under
rule
11.
i
am
very
troubled
by
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
rule
11
classically
covers
this
conduct.
justice
kennedy
were
100
percent
of
the
fees
awarded
as
sanctions?
justice
kennedy
and
was...
is
there
a
finding,
either
implicit
or
explicit,
that
chambers,
the
client,
directed
100
percent
of
that
conduct?
justice
kennedy
is
the
rule
you
propose
that
if
a
fraud
is
designed
for
specific
judicial
proceedings,
that
that
is
within
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
sanction?
