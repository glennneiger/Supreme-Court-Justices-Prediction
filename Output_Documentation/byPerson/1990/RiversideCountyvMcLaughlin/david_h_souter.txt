justice
souter
i
don't
understand
that.
they're
not
saying
we
want
a
hearing
in
36
hours
or
no
hearing
at
all.
they're
saying
we
want
a
prompt
hearing.
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
prompt
hearing
is,
it's
one
which
will
be
held
within
36
hours.
and
if
at
any
point
after
that
we
haven't
had
a
hearing,
we
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
one.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
these
people
are
saying.
justice
souter
you're
right
there.
i
was
proceeding--
justice
souter
--i
guess
i
should
have
said,
on
justice
o'connor's
assumption.
if
they
had
not
had
a
hearing
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
the
only
reasonable
way
to
construe
their
claim
is
that
they
want
one.
justice
souter
they
want
a
hearing,
and
if
you
want
to
know
when
they
should
have
had
it,
they
will
tell
you
they
should
have
had
it
after
36
hours.
