justice
scalia
well,
that's
pretty
picky,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it
doesn't...
the
complaint
is
absolutely
idiotic
if
they
had
had
a
hearing.
they've
had
a
hearing,
and
you
think
that
that
is
what
the
complaint
means?
that
somebody
who
has
had
a
hearing
wants
not
damages
for
not
having
had
a
prompt
hearing,
but
he
is
asking
for
the
court
to
require
a
prompt
hearing?
even
though
he
has
already
had
a
hearing,
it's
too
late
for
a
prompt...
are
you
going
to
read
the
complaint
that
way?
justice
scalia
that's
just
a
ridiculous
way
to
read
the
complaint.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
it's
not
really
more
protective
in
the
sense
that
it
may
well...
what's
the
maximum
length
of
time?
is
it
7
days,
the
maximum
length
of
time
that
this
can
work
out
to?
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
you
could
be
held
for
7
days?
justice
scalia
and
what
happens
is
you
can
continue
to
be
held
if
after
7
days
this
higher
standard
is
met?
but
it
may
well
be
that
at
the
time
you
were
arrested
there
was
no
colorable
basis
for
probable
cause,
and
maybe
for
the
first
3
days
there
was
no
colorable
basis,
or
even
the
first
6
days,
but
then
the
state
digs
up
enough
evidence
by
the
seventh
day
to
establish
that
you
could
continue
to
be
held.
i
don't
consider
that
an
additional
protection.
it
means...
it
means
in
effect
you
never
do
get
a...
it's
too
late.
you
have
been
held
for
6
days
without
any
justification.
justice
scalia
i
know,
that
is
the
assumption,
but
that's...
that's
the
person
i'm
worried
about,
the
person
who
is
arrested
without
any
probable
cause.
justice
scalia
or
4
weekend
days
on
the
long
holiday,
such
as
thanksgiving.
justice
scalia
so
it
would
be
three
plus
four.
justice
scalia
if
it
is,
why
not
just
give
the
defendants
the
option?
i
mean,
you
know,
just
tell
them
that.
you
can
have
your
hearing
right
away
and
it'll,
you'll
be
out
in...
right
away
if
there
is
no
probable
cause,
or
we
will
give
you
even
greater
protections,
just
wait
7
days.
if
it's
really
in
their
interest,
i
presume
they'll
take
it.
justice
scalia
so
then
it's
not...
it's
not
much
of
a
burden
on
the
state's
system,
if
most
of
the
people
waive
it,
to
give
it
to
those
few
individuals
who
feel
that
there
indeed
was
no
probable
cause
for
their
arrest,
and
they
think
they
can
get
out
right
away
instead
of
waiting
7
days.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
mr.
stormer,
you
can't
prevent
that,
no
matter...
no
matter
what
we
say
in
this
case.
even
if
we
say
that
you
need
a
probable
cause
hearing
within
36
hours,
the
prosecutor
can
still
say
after
35
hours,
well,
you
know,
the
door
is
open,
go
home.
justice
scalia
he
can't
avoid
that.
