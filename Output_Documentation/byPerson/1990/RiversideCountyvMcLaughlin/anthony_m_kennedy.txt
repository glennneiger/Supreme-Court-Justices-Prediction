of

time

justice
kennedy
well,
just
so
i
understand
your
point,
suppose
a
person
has
been
held
for
10
days
and
files
a
complaint
and
says
i
have
not
been
given
a
prompt
hearing.
is
it
your
position
is
that,
well,
a
prompt
hearing
would
be
4
or
5
days,
so
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
for
you?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
is
that
your
reading
of
the
complaint?
justice
kennedy
but
in
that
facts,
i
put
your
position
is
no
standing.
justice
kennedy
just
as
a
preface
to
that,
can
you
tell
us
as
to
these
class
plaintiffs,
had
they
had
a
hearing
as
of
the
time
they
were
added
to
the
complaint?
justice
kennedy
they
had
not
had
any
hearing?
justice
kennedy
now,
are
these
matters
in
the
record?
justice
kennedy
and
some
of
these
had
been
held,
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
were
still
in
custody?
