mr.
timothy
t.
coates
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
a
class
action
lawsuit
filed
by
prisoners
in
the
riverside
county
jail
against
the
county
of
riverside
and
its
sheriff,
cois
byrd,
seeking
a
determination
that
the
county
of
riverside
fails
to
provide
warrantless
arrestees
with
a
probable
cause
determination
promptly
after
arrest,
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
gerstein
v.
pugh.
the
case
essentially
raises
two
issues.
first
a
threshold
question
of
standing
under
article
iii
of
the
named
plaintiffs
to
maintain
this
suit
for
injunctive
relief.
the
second
issue
is
one
of
substantive
criminal
procedure
of
great
importance
to
the
states
at
large,
namely
whether
a
state
can
incorporate
a
probable
cause
determination
into
an
existing
pretrial
procedure,
that
by
its
nature
may
accomplish
additional
purposes,
provide
additional
protections,
and
as
a
result
take
additional
time
to
perform.
the
case
originally
was
filed
as
a
complaint
by
plaintiff
donald
lee
mclaughlin
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
similarly
situated.
a
first
amended
complaint
was
also
filed,
again
with
mr.
mclaughlin
alone
as
the
named
class
representative.
it
alleged
that
he
had
been
held
5
days
in
the
riverside
county
jail,
had
been
released,
during
that
time
had
never
seen
a
judge,
had
not
received
a
prompt
arraignment,
probable
cause,
or
bail
hearing.
the
county
moved
to
dismiss
the
first
amended
complaint
based
on
mr.
mclaughlin's
lack
of
standing
to
maintain
an
action
for
injunctive
relief,
since
he
was
no
longer
in
custody
and
hence
no
longer
suffering
the
constitutional
violation
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
complaint.
plaintiffs
then
filed
a
second
amended
complaint,
adding
three
additional
plaintiffs
for
purposes
of
the
probable
cause
dispute.
as
to
these
three
plaintiffs
it
was
alleged
that
they
had
been
arrested
without
warrants,
were
presently
in
custody,
did
not
and
have
not
received
a
prompt
probable
cause
determination,
bail,
or
arraignment
hearing.
the
county
answered
the
second
amended
complaint,
the
class
was
certified,
and
then
the
plaintiffs
moved
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
were
in...
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
said
yes,
they
were
in
custody
as
of
the
filing
of
the
second
amended
complaint.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
not
no
hearing.
all
it
says
is
no
prompt
hearing
had
been
held.
did
not
receive
and
have
not
received
a
prompt
hearing.
nothing
was
said
about
not
receiving
a
hearing
at
all.
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--we
do
not
know
as
to
those
three
plaintiffs.
we've
not
made
a
factual
showing
on
that.
we
did
not
move
for
summary
judgment
on
that
issue.
we're
going
simply
on
the
four-square
of
the
pleadings.
our
position
is--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--the
standing
problem
is
still
that
if
it
is
one
that
is
temporally
bound,
something
is
either
prompt
or
it
is
not
prompt.
once
they
didn't
get
a
prompt
hearing,
they
would
not
be
cured
by
the
injunction
that
was
sought
in
this
case.
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
simply
requested
that
the
county
of
riverside
be
directed
to
provide
individuals
with
a
prompt
probable
cause
determination.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes,
but
again,
looking
at
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief
sought
and
the
ability
of
these
plaintiffs
to
obtain
that
relief,
you
can't,
once...
if
you're
saying
you
didn't
get
a
prompt
hearing
and
you're
asking
to
be
given
a
prompt
hearing,
you
simply
can't
benefit
from
that
injunction.
i
would
again
stress,
though,
this
complaint
doesn't
set
that
out.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
i
think
the
difficulty
is,
is
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
do
not
say
that
they
have
not
received
a
hearing.
again,
it
simply
says
that
they
did
not
receive
a
prompt
hearing.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
that
they
want
a
hearing.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes,
but
again,
i
think
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
the
case
is
there
is
simply
no
allegation
that
these
particular
people
didn't
have
a
hearing,
but
they
didn't
have
a
prompt
hearing.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
i
read
the
complaint--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--i'll
tell
you,
i
believe
that
the
language
of
the
complaint
does
support
that
interpretation,
and
i
find
it
no
more
ridiculous
in
many
respects
than
the
fact
that
when
they
filed
the
initial
complaint
it
was
extremely
clear
that
the
named
plaintiff
was
no
longer
in
custody
and
would
not
benefit
from
the
injunctive
relief
sought.
we're
holding
them
essentially
to
the
language
that
was
in
the
complaint.
at
no
time
have
they
offered
to
amend
to
say
anything
else.
so,
again,
for
purposes
of
looking
at
the
standing
of
the
named
plaintiffs
as
of
the
complaint
as
filed,
which
is
the
standard
the
court
has--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--i
can
only,
as
i
mentioned,
reiterate
the
argument
that
we
have
made
below,
that
if...
i
think
if
you
hold
them
to
the
four-square
language
of
the
complaint,
there
is
then
no
offer
to
amend
at
any
time,
that
it
shows
that
these
people
not
necessarily
suffer
the
deprivation
of
which
they
are
complaining.
and
as
to
the
gerstein
question,
again,
i
think
the
court,
looking
at
gerstein,
was
talking
of
the
question
of
mootness
of
that
point.
there
is
no
extended
discussion
of
standing.
but--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--he
would
be
able
to--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--gerstein
requires
a
hearing.
and
if
you
haven't
given
him
a
hearing,
at
the
very
least
he
has
the
right
to
request
a
hearing,
if
he
is
still
in
custody.
at
some
point
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
but
again
that's
not
what
this
is
about.
it's
something
with
a
temporal
limitation
on
it.
and
again,
i
don't
believe
the
allegations
of
the
complaint--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--no.
if
you
haven't
received
a
hearing
at
all,
you
can
say
i
deserve
a
hearing
under
gerstein,
you
must
give
me
one,
period.
that
is
not
a
question
of
a
temporal
hearing.
that's
what
i'm
saying,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
here
are
not
clear
on
that
fact,
and
that
is
what
our
argument
there
turns
upon.
but
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
argument,
as
mentioned,
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
thrust
of
it
was
that
the
county
of
riverside
was
not
providing
warrantless
arrestees
with
a
probable
cause
determination
promptly
after
arrest.
the
period
used
by
the
plaintiffs
to
define
this
was
36
hours,
which
is
a
period
applied
in
an
orange
county
case
also
brought
by
the
plaintiffs'
counsel,
also
decided
by
that
district
court
judge,
which
was
settled
prior
to
resolution
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
in
moving
for
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
evidence
presented
by
plaintiffs
was
that
people
in
riverside
county,
warrantless
arrestees,
would
not
receive
a
probable
cause
determination
until
the
time
of
arraignment.
the
chief
evidence
presented
on
this
were
booking
sheets
for
the
riverside
county
jail
which
showed
the
arrestees'
process
through
the
system.
the
district
court
found
that
providing
probable
cause
determinations
within
the
time
frame
of
arraignment
in
california,
which
is
2
days,
excluding
weekends
and
holidays,
was
too
long
under
gerstein,
holding
that
per
se
once
the
time
in
which
to
complete
the
administrative
steps
instant...
incident
to
arrest
had
passed,
that
was
the
time
that
you
had
to
have
the
hearing,
even
if
it
was
on
an
ex
parte
basis,
even
if
it
was
on
a
weekend,
within
36
consecutive
hours
of
arrest.
the
county
contended
in
the
district
court
and
again
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
california
has
essentially
taken
up
this
court's
invitation
in
gerstein
to
incorporate
probable
cause
determinations
into
existing
pretrial
procedures
that
may
afford
an
arrestee
additional
benefits
than
would
be
available
in
a
straight
ex
parte
hearing
devoted
solely
to
determining
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
indeed,
following
this
court's
decision
in
gerstein,
the
supreme
court,
california
supreme
court,
in
in
re
walters
expressly
held
that
misdemeanants
were
to
receive
this
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
prior
to
that
time,
in
fact--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
noted
before
the
break,
in
gerstein
v.
pugh
this
court
expressly
declined
to
set
forth
a
specific
period
of
time
in
which
probable
cause
determinations
were
to
be
provided
to
warrantless
arrests.
instead
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
no
uniform
state
criminal
procedure,
and
in
fact
invited
the
states
to
incorporate
these
hearings
into
existing
pretrial
procedures
such
as
arraignment
or
even
preliminary
hearing.
in
so
doing
the
court
even
noted
that
several
model
codes
of
criminal
procedure
already
provide
for
this,
and
one
of
them,
the
ali
model
code,
allowed
this
probable
cause
determination
to
be
done
as
much
as
72
hours
after
arrest.
the
state
of
california
took
the
court
up
on
its
invitation
in
gerstein,
and
essentially
has
incorporated
these
hearings
into
arraignment,
which,
under
california
law,
specifically
penal
code
section
825,
must
be
held
no
later
than
2
days
after
arrest,
but
excluding
saturdays,
sundays,
and
holidays.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
there's
no
statute
as
to
arrest,
but
as
to
an
overall
probable
cause
determination,
yes,
it
must
be
done
by
preliminary
hearing.
yet
by
case
law,
people
v.
powell,
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
at
first
appearance
to
challenge
probable
cause
for
arrest.
the
county
of
riverside--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--the
position
we
have
taken,
it
was
our
argument
throughout
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
that
we
would
be
willing
to
live
with,
would
be
to
do
the
probable
cause
determination
for
felons
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
and
i
submit,
the
district
court
in
fact
took
us
at
its
word.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes.
he
is
advised
of
his
right
to
that
hearing.
he
can
waive
that
right,
as
he
can
waive
other
substantive
rights
that
are
bestowed
by
the
constitution.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes,
it
is.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
an
additional
hearing...
there
will...
he
will
still
get
a
preliminary
hearing,
because
california
law
requires
it.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
he
will
get
a
probable
cause
determination
at
arraignment
based
upon,
at
that
point,
probably
just
the
arrest
report
and
the
like.
preliminary
hearing
ends
up
being
more
extensive,
because
at
that
point
witnesses
are
called,
there
is
a
right
to
cross-examination
in
felony
cases,
and--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--that's
right.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
that's
right.
but
if
you're
going
to
be
held
to
answer,
you're
per
se
going
to
have
had
probable
cause
to
that
point.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
it
may
be
more
protective;
more
may
occur
at
that
hearing.
but
a
finding
of
going
forward
and
being
held
to
answer
would
certainly
satisfy
something
more
than
just
probable
cause.
but
again,
a
felon
in
riverside
has
the
right,
and
he
is
advised
so,
of
a
hearing
on
probable
cause
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
and
indeed
the
district
court--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--on
arraignment?
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
on
arraignment,
with
the
thanksgiving
holiday,
that's
essentially
what
you
could
get.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yeah.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
in...
there's
an
assumption
there
that
there
is
no
probable
cause
arrest
to
begin
with.
7
days
is
the
outside
time
period.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
the...
when
you
get
the
hearing,
i
mean,
the
hearing
can
be
on
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
officers.
there
may
sometimes
be
additional
evidence;
typically
there
is
not.
but
reading
gerstein,
gerstein
is
talking
about
continued
detention,
not
necessarily
an
ex
post
facto
determination
of
which...
whether
the
initial
arrest
was
per
se
legal
or
illegal.
it
may
have
ramifications
in
a
case,
i
mean,
california
certainly
would
exclude
evidence
if
produced
by
the
illegal
arrest
itself.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
district
court
in
granting
the
preliminary
injunction
said
as
much
as
5
days.
i
believe
it
was
using
a
holiday
scenario,
albeit
maybe
not
the
thanksgiving
holiday
scenario.
but
it
said
it
might
be
5
days.
that
is
including
the
weekend
when
the
courts
are
not
in
session.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
that's
essentially
what
it
is,
yes,
because
if
the
2-day
period
expires
when
courts
are
not
in
session,
you
don't
have
the
hearing
until
the
following
court
day.
that
is
what
825
provides.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes.
because
california
courts
are
not
open--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--during
that
time
period.
the
arraignment
hearing
itself
is
a
more
protective
hearing
and
provides
significant
benefits,
similar
to
those
that
the
court
approved
in
schall
v.
martin
in
upholding
the
juvenile
detention
statute
against
a
due
process
attack,
and
it
even
mentioned
gerstein
and
the
probable
cause
time
frame.
because
at
arraignment
you
get
a
much
better
hearing
than
this
ex
parte
procedure
envisioned
by
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit.
if
you
have
the
counsel
present,
counsel
can
review
the
evidence
that
is
before
the
magistrate
for
the
probable
cause
determination,
and
can
speak
to
the
issues
in
there.
and
that
is
simply
not
available
to
the
plaintiffs
in
the
ex
parte
proceedings.
and
we
submit
that
the
ability
of
counsel
to
assist
you
in
and
of
itself
is
a
significant
procedural
protection.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
mr.
mclaughlin
filed
it
originally,
yes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
at
the
time
he
filed
the
complaint
he
had
been
released
from
custody.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
no
one
is...
no
one
was
arguing
as
to
custody
or
to
interfere
with
their
pending
proceedings,
but
yes,
the
problem
is
it's
a
direct
injection--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--yes.
in
california
if
you
are
being
held
without
a
probable
cause
determination,
you
could
apply
for
a
habeas
corpus
if
you
believe
you
were
illegally
arrested
and
that
they
are
using
evidence
obtained
from
that
improperly.
that
is
an
issue
that
is
raised
in
the
underlying
criminal
proceeding.
it
is,
we
submit,
a
fairly
significant
invasion
of
the
state
process
to--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--not
argued
extensively--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--no,
no.
we
interpret
them
as
not
really
arguing
for
a
change
of
the
conditions
of
confinement,
or
to
alter
the
sentences,
but
solely
a
challenge
as
to
the
procedures
itself.
although
we
note
that
they
do
have
a
remedy
under
state
law
for
habeas
corpus
and
the
right,
if
they
are
being
held
without
probable
cause,
and
i
think
that
is
somewhat
different
even
than
in
gerstein,
where
there
was
no
habeas
corpus
available
in
the
state
court
system
to
review
the
lack
of
probable
cause.
california
has
taken
extreme
steps
to
make
sure
that
individuals
do
in
fact
get
a
gerstein
hearing.
but
again,
it's
the
type
of
hearing
that
this
court
envisioned
states
might
in
fact
use
at
the
time
it
decided
gerstein.
that
is
to
say,
a
hearing
where
something
much
more
than
just
probable
cause
determination
is
going
to
take
place.
and
as
a
result,
because
additional
things
are
done
at
this
hearing,
per
se
it
is
going
to
take
additional
time.
and
essentially
to
have
the
clock
tick
solely
based
upon
your
ability
to
complete
arrest
reports,
without
taking
into
consideration
that
someone
may
get
a
better
hearing
with
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
like,
or
that
additional
things
may
be
accomplished,
it
really
essentially
precludes
states
from
providing
these
more
extensive
protective
proceedings.
because
there
is
just
inherent
delay
within
the
system.
you
have
to
have
a
court
open.
if
your
courts
are
not
open
on
weekends,
because
it
must
be
done
in
an
open
court.
you
have
to
be
able
to
muster
not
simply
a
public
defender
or
a
defense
attorney
to
represent
the
person
in
custody,
but
a
district
attorney.
also
in
california,
arraignment
has
the
benefit
that
you
might
get,
with
a
misdemeanor,
a
disposition
as
to
the
entire
case.
you
may
get
a
dismissal
of
charges.
and
we
note
that
the
second
circuit
in
williams
v.
ward
found
this
a
significant
factor
in
upholding
a
probable
cause
scheme
which
took
place
at
the
time
of
arraignment
within
72
hours
of
arrest.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
also
a
concrete
benefit
to
a
defendant.
i
think--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
the
difficulty...
first
of
all,
at
the
time
you're
making
that
offer
to
them,
they
generally
are
not
represented
by
counsel,
and
they
may
not...
it
may
not
be
in
their
interest
to
have
the
immediate
hearing.
because
again,
and
i
think
this
is
borne
out...
we
have
an
amicus
brief
filed
that
notes
most
people
waive
this
hearing
when
they
are
advised
of
it,
even
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
particularly
felons,
and
then
they
are
represented
by
counsel.
and
you
can
understand
why,
because
they
would
want
the
most
extensive
fact-finding
proceeding,
or
the
most
extensive
proceeding
possible
to
vindicate,
to
vindicate
their--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
they
waive
it
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
knowing
that
there
is
another
procedure
down
the
line,
if
they
are
a
felon.
if
they
are
a
misdemeanant,
it's
up
to
their
counsel.
i
mean,
they
get
the
hearing
if
they
ask
for
it.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
if
their
counsel
looks
at
it
and
thinks,
gee,
there
is
no
probable
cause,
he
is
entitled
at
that
time
to
raise
it
significantly.
if
you
just
make
it
available
and
then
give
them
the
option,
then
you
are
essentially
are
creating
a
separate
tier
of
pretrial
proceedings
that
really
don't
serve
that
significant
of
a
benefit.
they
don't
benefit
the
vast
number
of
arrestees,
and
in
fact
they
really
operate
to
the
detriment
of
the
majority
of
arrestees,
because
you'll
end
up
getting
a
slowing
of
the
entire
process.
obviously,
fiscal
concerns
are
not
the
be
all
and
end
all
when
it
comes
to
constitutional
rights.
we're
not
saying
they
are,
but
there
is
a
reality
that
criminal
justice
systems
are
operating
within
very
strict
budgetary
parameters
at
times.
and
pulling
a
judge
to
sit
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding
to
hear
a
handful
or
more
of
people
who
want
these
hearings
is
just
not
efficient,
when
you
look
that
it
will
end
up
delaying
arraignment,
could
delay
preliminary
hearings,
and
with
resources,
could
even
delay
trials.
it
just
doesn't
benefit
the
arrestee
class
as
a
whole
to
have
a
less
protective
hearing.
and
again,
i
note
that
there
is
no
finding
by
the
district
court,
and
certainly
plaintiffs
have
not
argued
that
the
county
of
riverside
unnecessarily
delays
arraignment,
that
we're
dragging
our
feet
within
the
california
period.
there's
simply
an
assumption
that
arraignment
automatically
is
going
to
be
too
late,
because
it's
going
to
take
place
sometime
after
these
administrative
steps
incident
to
arrest
take
place.
the
state
has
and
a
very
significant
interest
in
having
some
sort
of
uniform
time
period
within
certain
parameters
that
can
be
applied
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
indeed
it
is.
california
uses
2
days
as
an
outside
time
period.
but
the
california
supreme
court
held
in
people
v.
powell
that...
just
that
you
get
them
to
arraignment
within
2
days
isn't
necessarily
reasonable
if
they
can
show
that
there
has
been
some
pernicious
delay
through
the
system.
and
plaintiffs
have
at
no
point
attempted
to
show
that,
and
the
district
court
doesn't
indicate
it.
it
goes
solely
by
the
standard
that
once
the
time
you
complete
those
arrest
reports
ends,
you
must
have
that
ex
parte...
essentially
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
and
we
submit,
again,
that
the
states
have
a
considerable
interest
in
uniformity.
we
literally
have--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
the
ninth
circuit
found
it...
yeah,
that
it
could
be
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no,
that
is
true,
but
that
would
add
still
another
layer
of
complexity
to
transport
them
to
the
hearing
officer,
and
at
that
time
they
don't
have
counsel.
they
would
in
a
sense
be
in
pro
per
at
that
point.
but
we
refer
to
it
as
an
ex
parte
hearing
because
that's
essentially
what...
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
that
ground.
the
county
of
riverside
did
not
debate
personal
appearance
or
raise
that
issue,
but
the
county
of
san
bernardino,
in
a
consolidated
case
with
us,
did.
and
that
is
why
the
ninth
circuit
reached
that.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no.
the
court
was
careful
to
say
that
it
wasn't
absolutely
required.
in
fact,
my
recollection
is
that
the
circuit
court
in
gerstein
had
basically
imposed
a
fairly
substantial
procedural
protections
at
this
hearing,
and
the
court
said
well,
that
goes
too
far,
you
don't
need
those.
but
i
think
certainly
the
court
did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
a
state
could
provide
those
protections.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
or
the
evidence
submitted
by
the
police,
the
police
officer.
that
is
probably
the
minimum,
because
it
parrots,
basically,
the
warrant
procedure,
if
you
could
get
an
advance
warrant.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
evidence
that
would
support
a
warrant
for
arrest.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
to
a
committing
magistrate.
that
is
essentially
the
ninth
circuit's
rationale
for
not
requiring
a
personal
appearance.
but
again,
that
may
be
the
minimum
you
can
get
at
that
hearing.
i
think
the
court
made
it
clear
it
was
not
precluding
the
states
from
providing
additional
protections
that
may
afford
the
arrestee
additional
benefits,
and
also
recognize
that
the
states
themselves
had
an
interest
in
not
having
an
entire
separate
tier
of
proceedings.
and
again,
that
is
essentially
what
we
have
mandated
in
california
now.
there
is
no
uniformity.
in
fact,
attorneys
are
basically
going
on
a
county-by-county,
city-by-city
basis
to
have
a
determination
made
within
each
jurisdiction
as
to
what
the
reasonable
probable
cause
time
period
is
in
that
jurisdiction.
for
example,
in
our
case
you
can
see
there
are
a
trio
of
lawsuits
involving
orange
county,
riverside
county,
and
san
bernardino
county,
all
before
the
same
district
court
judge.
all
of
those
have
a
36-hour
requirement.
on
the
other
hand,
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
case
of
bernard
v.
city
of
palo
alto,
said
it
was
24
hours.
indeed
even,...
indeed
even
in
the
context
of
our
own
case
the
district
court
has
left
open
the
question
as
to
what
the
time
frame
might
be
for
the
outlying
jails
in
riverside
county.
and
the
result
is
that
we
end
up
having
a
real
patchwork
in
california
of
the
time
frame
in
which
these
hearings
must
be
conducted,
and
they
are
determined
solely
by
the
intervention
of
the
federal
courts.
we
submit
that
that
is
an
improper
injection
into
the
state's
own
administration
of
its
criminal
justice
system.
if...
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
respond
to
justice
blackmun's
inquiry
as
to
the
practice
throughout
the
state
of
california.
i
note
that
when
mr.
stormer
responded
he
talked
about
santa
clara
county
which
was
subject
to
the
injunction
in
bernard
v.
city
of
palo
alto,
24
hours,
and
also
to
orange
county,
which
was
another
county
that
was
subjected
to
a
district
court
hearing
like
this
one.
the
general
practice
in
california,
and
it
is
clearly
evident
in
california
penal
code
section
991
and
also
in
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
in
re
walters,
is
that
the
gerstein
hearing
is
conducted
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
people
v.
powell,
a
california
supreme
court
decision
that
predates
in
re
walters,
says
this
is
an
issue
that
is
raised
at
arraignment.
so
i
take
great
exception
with
mr.
stormer's
representation
that
this
is
unique
to
riverside
county.
it
is
not.
it
is
completely
codified
in
california
law.
and
i
think
it
again
bears
noting
that
when
you
look
at
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact,
brief
though
they
were
in
the
order
granting
preliminary
injunction,
the
time
period
it
talks
about
is
the
arraignment
time
period.
when
the
ninth
circuit
issued
its
opinion
in
this
case
it
talks
about
the
2
court
day
time
period
of
arraignment.
i
think
there
is
an
assumption
here,
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record,
the
county
gives
these
hearings
at
arraignment
if
they
are
requested.
you
are
advised
of
your
right.
if
there
is
a
problem
that
the
advisement
isn't
as
clear
for
felons
as
it
is
for
misdemeanants,
or
that
the
district
court
didn't
believe
we
were
doing
it
at
arraignment
but
were
waiting
until
preliminary
hearing
for
felons,
then
the
remedy
would
have
been,
and
if
the
court
believed
you
could
do
it
at
arraignment,
would
have
been
to
require
it...
make
us
clearly
do
it
for
felons
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
but
the
district
court
was
willing
to
assume
that
we
did
it
for
felons
at
arraignment,
but
just
said
no,
you
can't
do
that,
that
is
per
se
too
long
under
gerstein
because
you
don't
need
that
amount
of
time
in
which
to
basically
do
an
ex
parte
hearing
of
probable
cause
issue
alone.
and
mr.
stormer
is
correct
that
we
acknowledged
in
the
district
court
that
a
strict
probable
cause
hearing
alone
might
be
done
in
the
average
case
in
24
hours.
it
doesn't
take
that
long
to
just
prepare
that
paperwork.
but
what
has
never
been
denied
in
this
case,
that
if
we
are
in
fact
to
be
permitted
to
include
it
in
our
preexisting
pretrial
proceeding,
such
as
arraignment,
that
proceeding
and
the
additional
protections
themselves
inherently
take
more
time.
those
we
cannot
do
within
24
hours.
those
we
largely
cannot
do
within
36
hours,
although
i
would
suggest
that
a
review
of
the
booking
sheets
that
we
submitted
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
and
i...
we
have
a
statistical
breakdown
in
our
brief,
show
that
we
are
fairly
quick
in
arraigning
people.
there
are
people
that
are
arraigned
within
1
court
day.
the
majority,
vast
majority
are
easily
within
2
court
days
of
arrest.
we
are
not
slow
in
arraigning
people.
the
essential
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
gerstein
meant
what
it
said
in
many
respects
in
terms
of
allowing
the
states
to
incorporate
these
hearings
into
existing
pretrial
proceedings.
now,
in
williams
v.
ward
the
second
circuit
very
carefully
examined
this
court's
decision
in
gerstein,
and
also
in
schall,
and
said
if
the
proceeding,
such
as
arraignment,
offers
additional
benefits
and
serves
other
state
interests
as
well...
some
of
the
benefits
are
for
the
arrestees,
some
are
for
the
states...
then
it's
okay.
it
is
a
reasonable
delay,
it
is
necessary
to
incorporate
it
into
existing
pretrial
proceeding.
but
i
suggest
there
is
a
clear
conflict
between
that
and
the
position
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit,
because
the
ninth
circuit
allows
no
delay
beyond
the
time
necessary
to
conduct
those
administrative
steps
incident
to
arrest.
now
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
does
not
mention
williams
v.
ward.
it
doesn't
even
talk
about
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
in
re
walters.
it
doesn't
mention
schall
v.
martin.
it
simply
declares
that
once,
administrative
steps
incident
to
arrest
have
been
completed,
you
must
have
this
hearing.
and
i
suggest
again,
if
you
look
at
bernard
v.
city
of
palo
alto,
where
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
a
24-hour
probable
cause
determination,
you
see
the
same
counting
done.
that
is
to
say,
the
lower...
in
the
lower
court
the
public
entity
argued
that
under
california
procedures
they
were
doing
it
at
arraignment.
the
ninth
circuit
said,
look,
only
at
the
time
necessary
to
complete
the
administrative
steps.
if
states
are
to
be
permitted
to
incorporate
these
hearings--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--certainly.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no.
well,
no,
they
are
not
conducted
within
36
hours.
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
within
the
2
court
day
period,
but
not
within
36
consecutive
hours.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
it
happens
in
some
cases.
it
happens...
generally
if
someone
is
arrested
on
a
warrant
and
then
arraigned,
they
may
be
arraigned
faster
because
there
is
less
paperwork
to
do
with
them.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
in
most
of
them
they
are.
the
time
of
arraignment
would
be
2
court
days,
essentially.
