chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1817,
county
of
riverside
and
cois
byrd,
sheriff
of
riverside
county
v.
donald
lee
mclaughlin,
et
al.--
mr.
coates,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
even
if
you
don't
get
a
prompt--
--but
the
assumption
that
you--
--even
if
you
don't
get
a
prompt
hearing,
you
ought
to
get
some
hearing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
coates,
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coates,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
determination
of
whether
he
should
be
held
to
answer--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--which
might
be
different.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
any
of
the
courts
make
findings
as
to
what
the
average
length
of
time
was
between...
under
your
county's,
riverside
county's,
practice,
between
the
time
of
arrest
and
the
time
of
the
arraignment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
not
talking
about
5
business
days,
you're
talking
about
3
business
days
plus
2
weekend
days?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did...
do
you
think
gerstein
contemplated
any
representation
by
the
defendant
at
this
probable
cause
hearing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
is
the
minimum
required
by
gerstein?
simply
an
appearance
of
a
police
officer
before
a
committing
magistrate
to
show
cause
for
detention?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that...
so
there
would
just
be
the
submission
of
a
warrant,
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--to
a
committing
magistrate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coates.
mr.
stormer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
stormer,
what
are
you
relying
on
now?
facts
or
evidence
in
the
record,
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--statutes,
or...
evidence
in
the
record?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
a
typical
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
not...
you
know,
that's
not
helpful
right
now.
i'm
not
going
to
thumb
through
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
counting
weekends.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
stormer,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
this
aspect
of
the
case
at
all,
as
i
understand
it.
reading
their
opinion,
i
don't
find
anything
corresponding
to
what
you're
saying.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
and
we're
basically
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
something
has
to
be
done
within
a
particular
time.
you're
pointing
out
that
in
fact
it
may
have
taken
a
lot
longer
in
some
of
these
hearings
than
the
person
representing
the
county
says,
but
i
don't
know
how
all
of
these
details
really
bear
on
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
state
of
california,
as
i
understand
it,
must
provide
a
probable
cause
hearing
within
36
hours.
the
state
is
saying
gerstein
against
pugh
doesn't
require
that.
and
you,
instead
of
arguing
that
gerstein
v.
pugh
does
require
that,
are
saying
look,
the
county
not
only
didn't
do
it
in
36
hours,
but
they
took
11
days.
but
that
really
isn't
what
we're
talking
about,
how
long
the
county
did
take.
the
question
is
how
long
does
the
constitution
permit
them
to
take.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
you're
drawing
on
language
from
gerstein
to
say
they
must
conduct
it
as
soon
as
they
have
completed
the
booking
process?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
are
cases
from
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
would
be
a
possible
method
of
complying
with
what
you
view
as
the
requirement
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stormer.
mr.
coates,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
said
they
were
conducted
within
2
court
days.
chief
justice
rehnquist
within
the
2
court
day--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr....
excuse
me.
thank
you,
mr.
coates.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1817,
county
of
riverside
versus
mclaughlin
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
