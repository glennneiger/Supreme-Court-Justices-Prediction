justice
stevens
they
don't
contend
it
must
be
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
do
they?
justice
stevens
but
i
mean
the
defendants
or
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
aren't
asking
for
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
are
they?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
a
question?
justice
stevens
did
you
say
that
most
arraignments
are
conducted
within
36
hours?
justice
stevens
--just
looking
at
the
universe
of
warrantless
arrests--
justice
stevens
--most
of
those
are
not...
the
arraignment
is
not
normally
conducted
within
36
hours?
justice
stevens
so
they
are
asking
that
in
most
cases
the
time
of
the
probable
cause
hearing
be
delayed
beyond
36
hours?
