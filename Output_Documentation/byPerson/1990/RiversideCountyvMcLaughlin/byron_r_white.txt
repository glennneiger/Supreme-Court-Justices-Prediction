justice
white
you're
saying
it
recognizes
that
kind
of
a
hearing
is
different
from
what
it
is
requiring
for
the
constitution?
justice
white
do
you
think...
who
started
this
case?
mclaughlin?
justice
white
and
he
was
in
custody
at
the
time?
justice
white
what
business
does...
what
business
has
a
federal
court
got
entertaining
a
suit
like
this
which
really
is...
aren't
there
some
younger
considerations
in
this
case?
justice
white
this
issue
could
have
been
raised
in
the
state
courts
as
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding.
justice
white
you
didn't...
you
didn't
argue
that,
though--
justice
white
--you
never
raised
younger
or
anything
close
to
it.
justice
white
and
why
does
that
happen?
justice
white
because
the
prosecutor
determines
that
they
haven't
got
enough
evidence?
justice
white
is
gerstein
satisfied
if
there
has
been
an
arrest
warrant?
