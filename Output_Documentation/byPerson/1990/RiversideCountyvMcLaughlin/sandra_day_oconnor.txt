justice
o'connor
well,
had
any
hearing
been...
had
any
probable
cause
hearing
been
conducted
as
of
that
time?
justice
o'connor
well,
assuming
they
had
had
no
probable
cause
hearing,
what's
the
standing
problem?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
gerstein
case
sort
of
answers
that
and
says
there's
standing.
i
mean,
you're
asking
us
to
take
a
very
strict
and
rather
peculiar
reading
of
the
complaint,
and
i
wonder
if
you
shouldn't
move
on
to
the
merits.
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
california
statute
that
provides
for
when
the
probable
cause
hearing
must
be
conducted
in
felony
cases?
justice
o'connor
so
what's
the
county
policy
that
we're
dealing
with
here
exactly
for
felony
cases?
precisely
what
is
it
that
the
county
has
been
doing?
justice
o'connor
if
the
felon
requests
it,
if
the
person
arrested
requests
it.
justice
o'connor
and
if
requested,
it
is
conducted
then
and
there
at
the
arraignment?
justice
o'connor
not
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
the
probable
cause
determination
is
what
we're
talking
about,
i
thought.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
the
record
showed
36
hours
was
appropriate
in
this
particular
county?
justice
o'connor
do
you
take
issue
with
that?
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
well,
what's
the
policy?
it's
arraignment
within
2
days,
not
counting
holidays
and
weekends?
justice
o'connor
so
when
you
say
7
days,
could
that
only
occur
on
thanksgiving?
justice
o'connor
mr.
stormer,
do
you
think
that
the
constitution
allows
for
a
lengthier
period
of
delay
before
conducting
arraignment
than
the
probable
cause
hearing?
justice
o'connor
and
why
is
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
has
this
court
said
is
constitutionally
required
in
terms
of
time
for
conduct
of
arraignment?
justice
o'connor
just
that
it
has
to
be
conducted
promptly?
justice
o'connor
and
it's
not
sufficient,
in
your
view,
to
say
that
the
probable
cause
hearing
must
be
conducted
promptly,
and
perhaps
at
the
same
time
as
arraignment?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
could
be,
though.
they
could
be
combined,
could
they
not?
justice
o'connor
and
why
wouldn't
the
time
limit
for
each
be
adequate?
justice
o'connor
and
the
defendant
needn't
be
present?
justice
o'connor
but
a
judge
needs
to
conduct
it--
justice
o'connor
--or
a
magistrate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
follows
from
an
opinion
of
the
court
handed
down
in
the
case
of
gerstein
versus
pugh
where
this
court
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
prompt
judicial
determination
of
probable
cause
following
a
warrantless
arrest.
the
respondent,
mr.
mclaughlin,
brought
this
class
action
suit
under
section
1983
against
the
county
of
riverside
in
california.
the
plaintiff's
claim
that
county's
policy
governing
probable
cause
determinations
for
persons
arrested
without
a
warrant
violates
the
holding
in
the
gerstein
case.
currently,
riverside
county
combines
probable
cause
determinations
with
its
arraignment
procedures,
and
it
offers
the
combined
proceedings
within
48
hours
of
arrest
exclusive
of
weekends
and
holidays.
under
this
policy,
persons
arrested
without
a
warrant
could
spend
up
to
five
or
six
days
before
receiving
a
probable
cause
hearing.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
requiring
that
all
persons
arrested
without
a
warrant
be
given
a
probable
cause
hearing
within
36
hours
of
arrest.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
the
county's
policy
was
inconsistent
with
our
holding
in
the
gerstein
case
which
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
read
to
require
probable
cause
determinations
immediately
on
completion
of
the
administrative
steps
incident
to
arrest.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
riverside
county
is
entitled
to
combined
probable
cause
determinations
with
its
arraignment
proceedings,
but
that
it
must
offer
those
combined
proceedings
within
48
hours
or
less
following
a
warrantless
arrest.
weekends
and
holidays
may
not
be
excluded
from
this
time
limit.
combined
proceedings
offered
within
48
hours
will,
as
a
general
matter,
immunize
jurisdictions
from
class
action
suits
challenging
a
systemwide
policy.
the
48-hour
period
does
not
provide
jurisdictions
with
absolute
immunity,
however.
a
jurisdiction
may
still
be
subject
to
an
individual
lawsuit
if
the
plaintiff
can
prove
that
his
or
her
probable
cause
determination
was
delayed
unreasonably.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
have
joined;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
