justice
blackmun
mr.
stormer,
we're
dealing
with
the
riverside
city
jail,
aren't
we?
justice
blackmun
and
the
injunction
applied
only
to
the
city
jail?
justice
blackmun
is
this
a
widespread
practice
in
california
throughout
the
entire
state?
justice
blackmun
so
we
have
a
case
of
very
narrow
application
here.
justice
blackmun
should
we
have
taken
the
case?
justice
blackmun
do
you
feel
there
was
any
conflict
with
a
second
circuit
case?
justice
blackmun
the
conflict
is
pretty
shallow.
