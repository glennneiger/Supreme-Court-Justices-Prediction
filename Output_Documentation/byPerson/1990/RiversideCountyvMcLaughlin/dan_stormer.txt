mr.
dan
stormer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
submit
in
this
action
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
the
guiding
touchstone,
that
is,
one
merely
needs
to
look
at
gerstein
v.
pugh
and
apply
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
think
that
in
order
to
understand
the
case,
one
needs
to
go
very
quickly
through
the
facts
concerning
the
arraignment
process
and
the
arrest
process
in
riverside
county,
because
i
think
that
there
have
been
some
significant
misstatements
of
facts
as
it
relates
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
what
is
in
fact
provided.
when
a
person
is
arrested,
without
a
warrant
and
with
a
warrant,
in
riverside
county
and
they
fall
within
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
dan
stormer
--evidence--
mr.
dan
stormer
--evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes.
well,
it
is
a
combination
of
what
is
stated
within
the
record,
within
particularly
those
components
between
the
record
at
pages
120
through
126,
pages
276
and
277,
and
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
dan
stormer
okay,
i'm
sorry,
but...
i'm
relying
upon
the
record
and
upon
the
statements
made
by
grover
trask,
district
attorney,
in
the
amicus
brief
as
well.
mr.
dan
stormer
it
was
pled
that
they
had
not.
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
that.
and
if
i
may,
the
answer
is
that
they
had
not.
mr.
dan
stormer
they
had
not
had
any
hearing
at
all.
and
in
fact,
for
johnny
a...
johnny
e.
james,
he
never
got
a
hearing
at
all,
and
was
released
as
a
part
of
that
group
of
prisoners
which
i
will
describe,
who
the
district
attorney
makes
a
determination
after
3
to
5
days
and
lets
that
person
go,
but
he
is
maintained
without
arraignment,
without
hearing,
and
without
any
determination
or
appearance
before
court
for
anywhere
from
2
to
5
days,
and
then
is
released.
mr.
dan
stormer
these
matters
are
in
the
record.
they
are
contained
in
the
study
conducted
by
the
county
and
submitted
in
the
lower
court.
sixteen
of
the
46
felony
arrestees
were
released
under
what
is
called
pc-825,
and
that
is
explained
in
the
declarations
of,
i
believe,
lieutenant
kiyasu.
what
that
means
is
they
are
held...
they
are
arrested,
they
are
brought
to
they
jail,
they
are
maintained
within
the
jail.
during
that
time
period,
a
determination
is
made
by
the
prosecutor
as
to
whether
to
file
felony
charges.
they...
and
it
is
stipulated
by
the
defendants
at
page
82
of
the
record
that
they
will
be
released
at
or
about
5:00
on
the
last
possible
day
of
arraignment
without
ever
having
been
arraigned,
or
without
ever
appearing
before
court,
and
with
no
probable
cause
determination.
for
that
group
of
people,
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
condemned
in
gerstein
v.
pugh.
that
is
the
determination
as
to
probable
cause
is
being
made
by
the
prosecutor,
rather
than
by
an
independent
magistrate.
and
not
only
is
it
being
made
by
a
prosecutor,
it's
being
made
by
a
prosecutor
at
approximately
5
to
7
days,
and
it's
being
made
solely
for
the
purpose
of
upholding
prosecutorial
discretion.
that's
by
their
own
statement.
mr.
dan
stormer
nor
do
i
seek--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i
don't
seek
to
hold
that,
either.
in
fact,
i
think
that
that
has
a
salutary
effect
on
the
judicial
process.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
record
indicates
that
24
hours
is
the
appropriate
time
period
within
which
this
entire
booking
process
and
administrative
steps
incident
to
arrest
can
be
completed.
mr.
dan
stormer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
the,
the
defendants
have
conceded
that
the
process
can
be
completed
in
24
hours.
the
judge
ruled
that
36
hours
was
appropriate,
essentially
he
gave
a
12-hour
cushion.
mr.
dan
stormer
we
do
not.
mr.
dan
stormer
this
booking
process
that
i
have
discussed
takes,
as
i
said,
approximately
12...
excuse
me,
approximately
24
hours
to
complete
in
full.
thereafter,
there
are
basically
three
groups
of
people
that
come
within
the...
this
process
that
they
have
described.
the
first
group
is
the
one
i've
just
described.
that's
those
16
of
46
felony
arrestees
who
are
released
without
ever
having
any
probable
cause
hearing
and
are
released
by
their
own
stipulation
on...
at
5:00
on
the
last
possible
day
for
arraignment.
mr.
dan
stormer
that
happens--
mr.
dan
stormer
--the
prosecutor
determines
that...
basically
they
decline
to
prosecute,
whether
it's
because
of
not
enough
evidence
or
whatever
other
reasons
they
might
decline
to
prosecute
on.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes.
in
fact
mr.
james
fell
within
that
category.
the
second
group
are
felony
arrestees,
those
persons
charged
with
felonies.
and
i
take
significant
issue
with
the
description
give
by...
given
by
my
opposing
counsel.
the
record
indicates
the
following.
a
felony
arrestee
is
arraigned
at
1:30
on
the
last
possible
day
for
arraignment.
that's
anywhere
from
2
to
7
days
after
arrest.
at
1:30
the
felony
arrestee
is
taken
to
the--
mr.
dan
stormer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
2
days--
mr.
dan
stormer
--7
days
will
only
occur
during
thanksgiving
week
or
in
certain
times
at
christmas,
and
the
rest
of
the
time
the
maximum
would
be
5
and
sometimes
6
days.
mr.
dan
stormer
counting
weekends,
your
honor,
yes.
for
felony
arrestees,
they
are
taken
in,
at
1:30
they
are
brought
into
the
jail
chapel
and
they
see
a
videotape.
on
the
videotape
they
are
told
of
their
rights,
some
of
their
rights.
more
comes
later
in
the
arraignment.
at
the
very
end
of
the
videotape
they
are
told
that
you
have
a
right
to
a
probable
cause
hearing
if
you
request
one
at
this
time,
and
it
will
be
held
at
a
later
date.
in...
that's
absolutely
clear
in
the
record,
and
mr.
trask,
the
district
attorney,
in
his
deposition,
which
is
also
in
the
record,
testified
that
this
would
be
held
up
to
10
days
after
the
arraignment
process.
that's
because
the
arraignment
process
is
not
set
up
to
handle
it.
at
the
arraignment
process
there
is,
for
felonies,
an
attorney
present,
but
it
only
concerns
the
arraignment,
because
they
are
told
specifically
it
will
be
held
at
a
later
date,
and
mr.
trask
concurs
in
that.
it
will
be
held
up
to
10
days
later.
so
for
felony
arrestees
it
will
be
held
anywhere
from
2
to
17
days
later.
for
misdemeanants,
those
persons
charged
with
misdemeanors,
they
are
held
until
10:30
on
the
last
possible
day
for
arraignment.
they
are
brought
into
the
chapel.
there
is
no
lawyer
present.
in
fact
the
record
is
quite
clear
in
the
description
given
by
the
defendants,
in
their
own
submission
before
the
trial
court
they
say
that
felony
arrestees
get
attorneys,
but
there
is
no
reference
to
misdemeanor
arrestees,
and
i
would
submit
that
there
are
no
attorneys
provided
for
misdemeanor
arrestees.
and
they
are
told
that
they
have
a
right
to
a
probable
cause
hearing
if
they
request
one.
this
is
a
one-way
videotape,
no
live
person
there
at
this
point,
no
attorney
present,
and
no
description--
mr.
dan
stormer
--they
did
not
go
into
these
specific
facts.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
reason
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
each
of
these
segments
has
a
different
violation
of
gerstein
v.
pugh
contained
within
it,
a
very
specific
action
condemned
by
this
court.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
constitution
permits
them...
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
my
incomplete
description...
but
the
constitution
permits
the
county
of
riverside
to
conduct
a
probable
cause
review
within
that
time
necessary
to
complete
the
steps
incident
to
arrest.
and
the
record
below
is
that
that
process
is
approximately
24
hours.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
language
in
gerstein
says
those
steps
incident...
those
administrative
steps
incident
to
the
arrest.
and
that's
the
language
we're
drawing
upon.
that's
been
interpreted
in
many
cases
to
mean
essentially
the
booking
process--
mr.
dan
stormer
--there
are
no
cases
from
this
court.
the
cases...
well,
however,
the
booking
process
is
not
the
only
process
that
is
considered
in
this
24-hour
period
that
is
before
this
court
at
this
time.
also
the
time
period
that
it
takes
the
officer
to
complete
his
arrest
report
and
to
submit
it
to
a
supervisor
who
reviews
it
to
determine
if
there
is
probable
cause
contained
on
the
face
of
that
report.
that
is
essentially
what
we
are
proposing,
which
is
the
orange
county
procedure,
that
that
document
would
go
to
a
neutral
magistrate,
perhaps
as
is
done
in
orange
county,
who
comes
to
the
jail.
in
orange
county
they
dealt
with
14,557
in
a
year
period,
one
magistrate.
mr.
dan
stormer
that
is
correct.
the...
the
problems
that
exist
for
the
county
in
this
action
also
are
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
court
record
below
that
indicates
what
benefit
is
conferred
upon
any
of
these
individuals
as
a
result
of
the
procedure
used.
they
rely
upon
schall
v.
martin,
which
essentially
says
that
if
there
are
significant
benefits
conferred
in
some
fashion
by
the
state's
administrative
process,
you
may
elongate
the
process
because
of
those
benefits
conferred.
but
schall
v.
martin
is
not
comparable.
schall
v.
martin
involved
a
situation
where
you
had
more
benefits
than
it
provided
to
an
arrestee
with
a
warrant.
schall
v.
martin
had,
prior
to
detention,
notice,
hearing,
opportunity
to
heard...
be
heard,
opportunity
to
have
a
parent
or
counsel.
that
is
more
than
you
get
in
a
regular
warrant
situation,
and
that
is
what
this
court
in
schall
found
to
be
significant
enough
to
extend
the
time
period.
and
then
in
schall,
after
that
initial
hearing,
another
hearing
was
held
within
3
or
4
days
that
allowed...
that
was
a
full-blown
adversarial
process.
this
record
is
totally
bereft
of
a
single
stitch
of
evidence
as
to
what
the
probable
cause
review
would
consist
of.
they
have
never,
ever,
in
any
component
of
this
case,
submitted
a
single
iota
of
evidence
which
would
show
what
they
complain,
what
they
say
would
be
the
benefit.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes,
because
the
purpose--
mr.
dan
stormer
--the...
the
probable
cause
hearing
is
a
fourth
amendment
analysis
of
what
took
place
at
the
arrest,
and
potentially
even
what
could
be
gathered
within
the
period
incident
to
arrest.
the
arraignment
and
the
preliminary
hearing
are
fifth
amendment
procedures
that
deal
with
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
bind
over
for
trial
or
to
maintain
the
prosecution.
mr.
dan
stormer
i,
to
be
frank,
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
specific
ruling
of
this
court
that
has
set
a
time
period
for
arraignment.
mr.
dan
stormer
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
stormer
they
could
be.
even
under
state
procedure
they
could
be,
because
people
v.
powell
and
people
v.
chambers
say
that
if
the
delay
is
unnecessary,
then
it's
unconstitutional.
but
the
arraignment
process
is
only
of
sufficient
time...
combining
the
two,
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
and
the
fifth
amendment
arraignment
process,
is
only
of
a
benefit
to
the
prisoner
if
there
is
some
analysis
that
goes
into
that
process
to
look
to
see
whether
there
is
probable
cause
for
the
original
arrest.
that
isn't
what
is
done
at
the
arraignment,
nor
is
that
what
is
done
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
dan
stormer
they
could
be,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't.
mr.
dan
stormer
if
the
time
period
for
arraignment
was
correspondent
to
the
time
period
for
probable
cause,
then
they
could.
but
the
problem
in
this
case,
for
arraignment
you
need
a
sitting
judge,
you
need
somebody
to
hear
the
defendant,
you
need
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
you
need
all
of
those
components
of
the
arraignment
process.
for
a
probable
cause
review,
you
don't
need
any
of
those
things.
all
you
need
is
the
document
that
shows
that
on
its
face
there
is
probable
cause.
mr.
dan
stormer
and
the
defendant
needn't
be
present.
mr.
dan
stormer
or
a
hearing--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i'm
sorry.
or
a
hearing
officer.
because,
as
in
orange
county,
there
is
one
single
appointed
hearing
officer
who
is
an
attorney
who
reviews
these
documents,
and
found
in
1989
that
9.1
percent
of
the
persons
who
were
arrested
could
be
released
because,
on
the
face
of
the
documents,
there
was
not
probable
cause.
and
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
county
like
riverside,
that's
a
significant
number
of
people.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes.
mr.
dan
stormer
that
is
correct.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
practice
of
conducting
the
arraignments
at
the
same
time
as
a
probable
cause
hearing?
it
is...
it
is
not.
the
practice
varies
from
county
to
county.
in
santa
clara
county,
for
instance,
they
do
it
by
fax
and
telephone
review.
in
orange
county
they
conduct
it
within
the
jail.
they
don't
exclude
weekends.
it
is
a...
it
is
the
beauty
of
gerstein,
which
is
each
county
is
entitled
to
set
up
its
procedure
according
to
those
administrative
steps
which
are
necessary.
mr.
dan
stormer
extremely
narrow
application,
because
it
simply
applies
to
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
exist
within
riverside
county,
within
the
riverside
county
main
jail.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
don't
believe
that
the
case
should
have
been
taken,
to
be
frank.
i
think
that,
both
on
standing
and
on
the
gerstein
issue,
that
the
facts
of
this
case
plainly
indicate
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
case
that
has
the
significance
or
the
importance
that
should
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
only
conflict
that
exists,
if
we're
talking
about
williams
v.
ward,
would
be
the
analysis
that
goes
into
whether,
in
that
2
to
1
decision,
it
should
have
reached
that
result.
the
legal
analysis
was
identical.
are
there
sufficient
procedures
in...
and
sufficient
protections
and
sufficient
exigent
circumstances
in
new
york
city
to
extend
that
time
period
to
72
hours.
it's
a
simple
factual
analysis.
in
new
york
they
said
it's
a
highly
populated
crime
wave-type
city,
you
need
the
extra
time
period.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
conflict
is
extremely
shallow.
and
certainly
it
does
not
exist
for
robinson,
which
is
the
other
case
which
was
cited
to
by
the
county.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes.
if
there
is
an
arrest
warrant,
that's
the...
gerstein
essentially
creates
a
post-arrest
warrant,
and
if
there
is
a
pre-arrest
warrant,
then
gerstein
doesn't
apply.
just
very
quickly
on
the
issue
of
standing,
the...
in
the
complaint
at
paragraph
11
the
defend...
it
was
pled
quite
clearly
that
there
would
be,
quote,
"unless
and
until
ordered
by
the
court,
excessive
detention
of
warrantless
arrestees
before
probable
cause
hearings.
"
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
it
is
shown
and
complained
that
there
should
be
a
halt
to
those...
that
extensive
period
of
time
that
the
plaintiffs
at
that
time
were
suffering.
and
for
those
reasons
i
believe
that
the...
this
court
should
either
rule
that
this
case
was...
improvidently
certified,
or
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
