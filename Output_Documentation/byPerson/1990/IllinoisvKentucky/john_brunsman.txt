mr.
john
brunsman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
this
afternoon
by
talking
a
little
bit
about
the
1792
low-water
line,
whether
anyone
knows
where
it
is
or
not.
i
think
that
the
record
does
show
that
indiana,
ohio,
and
kentucky
all
resolved
their
boundary
dispute
following
this
court's
1980
decision
by
using
a
line
depicted
on
a
series
of
u.s.
geological
survey
maps
showing
the
1792
low-water
mark,
and
that
line
was
based
on
surveys
done
by
the
corps
of
engineers
about
the
time
of
1896
to
1906.
they
did
those
surveys
before
they
built
the
dams
on
the
river
that
have
raised
the
level
of
the
river
that
have
really
caused
the
problem
that
we
have
here
today,
and
the
parties
agreed
that
was
the
best
existing
representation
of
the
1792
line.
mr.
john
brunsman
it's
obviously,
your
honor,
it's
not
exactly.
they
just...
the
parties
determined
that's
the
best
approximation
they
could
ever
come
up
with.
mr.
john
brunsman
it
showed...
it
used
an
average
of
gauge
readings
on
various
parts
of
the
river
going
back
a
number
of
years
before
that,
up
to
50
years
before
that.
what
it
did
was
get
a
mean
low-water
mark
over
a
period
of
years,
and--
mr.
john
brunsman
--exactly.
and
the
22
u.s.
geological
survey
maps
showing
the
illinois-kentucky
section
of
the
boundary
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
they
are
filing
no.
44.
like
the
maps
between
kentucky
and
indiana
and
ohio,
they
all
show
the
boundary
as
the
low-water
mark
some
distance
south
of
the
contemporary
northern
shoreline.
it
varies
anywhere
from
100
feet
to
some
places
past
the
middle
of
the
river.
there
are
three
exceptions
to
that.
there
are
three
places
where
there
were
former
islands
in
the
river
that
have
now
become
attached
to
illinois.
illinois
concedes
those
are
part
of
kentucky
because
they
were
islands
originally,
so
that
1792
low-water
mark
would
have
been
north
of
them.
i
submit
that
these
maps
have
been
in
existence,
many
of
them
have
been
in
existence
since
the
1950's,
that
kentucky
had
some
notice,
some
idea
of
where
the
1792
low-water
mark
was,
just
as
illinois
was
put
on
notice
by
those
maps.
mr.
john
brunsman
i
believe
that
there
are
cases
that
indicate
that
you
can
have
in
effect
an
evulsive
change
created
by
manmade
intervention.
in
fact
illinois
resolved
a
dispute
informally
with
the
state
of
missouri
using
just
that
principle.
the
corps
of
engineers
had
built
a
dam
there--
mr.
john
brunsman
--assuming
that
we
had
a
case
other
than
ohio
v.
kentucky?
mr.
john
brunsman
i
would
assume
that
would
be
a
new
low-water
mark,
because
that's...
a
low-water
mark
would
be
the
point
the
river
recedes
in
its
lowest
stage
under
existing
circumstances.
that
would
be
one
definition.
mr.
john
brunsman
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
a
bridge
sign
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
use
to
deprive
a
state
of
what
would
otherwise
be
its
legal
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
letter
that
mr.
pearson
talked
about,
the
author
said
well,
this
is
close
enough
to
the
theoretical
state
line
for
our
purposes.
he
was
putting
up
a
sign
that
said
you're
leaving
kentucky
and
entering
illinois.
i
am
sure
he
would
have
been
quite
surprised
to
consider
that
he
might
be
determining
a
state
boundary
for
all
time
by
writing
that
letter.
i
don't
think
that's
the
sort
of
situation
or
the
sort
of
fact
you
would
rely
on
in
establishing
acquiescence.
and
in
discussing
the
facts
in
this
record
i'd
like
to
turn
at
this
point
to
the
various
kentucky
authorities
since
1890
that
have
recognized
the
1792
low-water
mark
to
be
kentucky's
boundary.
in
fact,
starting
in
1890
that
was
kentucky's
position
when
it
came
to
this
court
and
argued
the
indiana
v.
kentucky
case.
in
that
case
indiana
suggested
that
it
was
the
contemporary
low-water
mark.
this
court
disagreed,
siding
with
kentucky,
and
said
the
decisive
question
is
really
the
line
as
it
existed
in
1792,
and
that
it
was
fixed
at
that
point
and
wouldn't
change
thereafter.
so
beginning
as
early
as
100
years
ago
kentucky
authorities
themselves
have
acknowledged
the
1792
line.
following
that
decision
there
have
been
a
number
of
kentucky
authorities,
the
earliest
is
a
1916
kentucky
case
where
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
small
island
in
the
river
was
within
the
northern
boundary
of
kentucky.
that
kentucky
court
cited
indiana
v.
kentucky
and
said
the
boundary
is
defined
as
the
low-water
mark
as
it
existed
when
kentucky
became
a
state.
and
that
case,
i
would
submit,
is
of
significance
to
the
present
controversy
since
the
island
was
located
in
the
river
near
mound
city,
illinois.
so
in
that
perks
v.
mccraken
decision
we
have
explicit
recognition
by
kentucky
that
the
1792
line
applies
to
that
part
of
the
river
between
illinois
and
kentucky.
subsequent--
mr.
john
brunsman
--i
think
it
was
the
resolution...
the
resolution
of
the
earlier
cases
in
1980,
and
then
i
believe
the
actual
maps
weren't
completed
showing
a
line
until
1985.
i
think
that's
fair
to
say
was
the--
mr.
john
brunsman
--well,
the
line
that's
on
the
u.s.g.s.
map
shows
that
some
part
of
the
river
for
the
most
part
is
in
illinois.
so
to
that
extent
we
would
benefit.
i
think
at
the
time
we
filed
the
suit,
i'm
not
even
sure...
i
wasn't
aware
of
those
maps.
i'm
not
certain
if
anyone...
if
we
were,
but
they...
just
the
certainty
of
knowing
where
it
is
was
the
benefit
we
sought
to
obtain
by
filing
a
lawsuit
at
that
time,
knowing
that
the
court
had
just
resolved
it
with
regard
to
the
other
three
states
on
the
river,
and
that
it
seemed
like
the
opportune
time
to
do
so
as
far
as
illinois
was
concerned.
mr.
john
brunsman
i
think
that's...
it's
conceivable,
and
in
fact
that
is
the
situation--
mr.
john
brunsman
--well,
but
i
think
that...
this
is
based
on
a
premise
that
misconstrues
the
change
in
the
river.
the
river
hasn't
moved.
the
dams
have
raised
the
level
of
the
river
so
in
effect
it
has
spread
out
both
ways.
it's
deeper
behind
the
dams
than
it
was
naturally.
that's
why
the
original
pre-dam--
mr.
john
brunsman
--i
think
that
is
exactly
what
i
have
read,
that
that's
the
case.
also,
the
corps
of
engineers,
the
government
has
spent
many
millions
of
dollars
putting
these
dams
and
docks
there.
they
are
not
likely
to
let
it
gradually
move
around
those
dams
and
docks
so
that--
mr.
john
brunsman
--if
you
look
at
the
level
of
the
dams,
and
in
one
of
the
filings,
i
think
it's
filing
no.
41
in
exhibit
3
or
4,
some
corps
of
engineers
documents,
they
show
the
level
of
the
pool
behind
each
dam.
and
it's
above
the
existing
low-water
mark
because
each
dam
was
built
to
guarantee
a
minimum
9-foot
navigation
pass.
and
to
do
that--
mr.
john
brunsman
--well,
i...
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
can't
answer
that.
i
do
know
that
when
you
look
at
the
line
based
on
the
pre-map,
or
the
pre-dam
survey
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
you'll
see
that
all
along
the
shoreline
of
not
just
illinois,
but
indiana
and
ohio,
that
pre-dam
low-water
mark
is
for
the
most
part
south
of
the
shore.
another
source
that...
another
kentucky
source
recognizing
the
1792
line
was
the
1963
attorney
general's
opinion
where
the
kentucky
attorney
general
not
only
recognized
the
existence,
or
the
accuracy
of
the
1792
low-water
mark
as
kentucky's
boundary,
he
also
recognized
that
because
of
the
dams
it
would
be
south
of
the
contemporary
northern
shoreline
due
to
the
general
raising
of
the
river.
the
final
two
kentucky
sources
that
contain
statements
incompatible
with
kentucky's
position
here
are
their
two
bulletins
issued
in
1969
and
1972
by
the
special
ohio
river
boundary
subcommittee
of
the
kentucky
legislative
research
commission.
the
introduction
or
forward
to
the
first
of
those
bulletins,
bulletin
81,
tells
us
that
this
special
subcommittee
was
created
specifically
to
study
kentucky's
ohio
river
boundary
due
to
litigation
during
the
preceding
150
years.
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
that
despite
kentucky's
claim
here
that
it
has
always
asserted
its
boundary
to
be
the
low-water
mark
as
exists
from
time
to
time,
that
claim
was
somehow
lost
on
the
authors
of
this...
these
bulletins,
since
neither
one
of
those
bulletins
advanced
such
a
claim
on
kentucky's
behalf,
and
both
of
them
recognize
the
1792
low-water
mark.
so,
based
on
those
sources
running
from
1890
through
1972,
and
those
two
reports
were
even
issued
while
ohio
v.
kentucky
was
pending
in
this
court,
it
shows
to
me
first
that
kentucky
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
1792
line.
also
that...
oh,
that's
true,
there
was
also
confusion
within
kentucky,
because
the
legislative
research
commission
was
saying
it's
the
1792
line,
kentucky
in
their
answer
to
ohio's
original
complaint
said
no,
it
isn't.
and
again,
that
kind
of
uncertainty
and
confusion,
i
think,
fits
illinois'
position
in
this
case
because
you
don't
have
acquiescence
where
the
state
claiming
the
benefit
of
it
can't
show
a
longstanding
continuous
claim
to
the
boundary
they
are
seeking
to
have
the
court
adopt.
there
is
additional
evidence
in
the
record,
i
think,
also
that
shows
that
this
uncertainty
extends
to
both
states.
the
best
evidence
of
that
concerns
the
taxation
of
the
permanent
structures.
there
are
a
number
of
structures
built
on
the
illinois
shore
that
extend
into
the
river,
barge
loading
facilities,
coal
loading
facilities,
that
sort
of
thing.
illinois
identified
15
of
these
structures,
and
admittedly
we
could
produce
evidence
that
we
were
definitely
taxing
only
one
of
them.
that
was
part
of
a
grain-loading
facility
that
is
located
in
alexander
county,
illinois.
kentucky
of
course
argued
this
shows
that
they
have
exercised
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
river,
illinois
hasn't.
but
in
fact
the
record
also
shows
that
kentucky,
too,
has
only
taxed
one
of
these
15
structures.
so
really
what
you
have,
13
out
of
15
structures
aren't
being
taxed
by
either
state.
kentucky
did
try
to
tax
a
second
one--
mr.
john
brunsman
--they're
waiting,
holding
their
breath.
kentucky
did
try
to
tax
a
second
structure,
but
the
taxpayer
there
protested
on
the
grounds
that
they
felt
that
the
whole
thing
was
in
illinois
and
not
in
kentucky.
and
taxation
i
think
is
one
of
the
factors
the
court
has
traditionally
looked
at
in
these
acquiescence
cases,
and
here
i
think
it
supports
a
conclusion
that
the
record
shows
uncertainty
in
both
states,
and
that's
incompatible
with
a
finding
of
acquiescence.
another
example--
mr.
john
brunsman
--i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
have
been
down
there...
all
i
can
say
is
on
my
personal
visits
there
is
not.
it
is
mainly
used
for
commercial--
mr.
john
brunsman
--not
a
lot
of
boating.
i
only
know
of
one--
mr.
john
brunsman
--there
is
some
fishing.
there
is
some
commercial
fishing.
but
the
few
times
i
have
been
down
there
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
boating
on
the
river.
mr.
john
brunsman
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
[laughter]
another
incident
that
mr.
pearson
talked
about
was
the...
had
to
do
with
the
coroners.
and
he
mentioned
the
situation
where
the
illinois
coroner
always
asks
permission
before
he
takes
charge
of
a
drowning
victim
in
the
river.
while
it
happens
to
be
the
coroner
in
hardin
county,
illinois,
it
is
certainly
true
that
he
has
always
done
so.
but
it's
also
true
that
the
kentucky
coroner
has
always
given
his
permission,
even
in
the
most
recent
incident
where
the
victim
was
still
in
the
river
when
the
kentucky
coroner
arrived
on
the
scene.
and
i
would
submit
again
this
reflects
uncertainty
in
both
states,
since
kentucky
doesn't
suggest
how
one
of
its
coroners
could
legally
delegate
authority
over
a
death
occurring
in
the
commonwealth
to
an
illinois
official.
plainly
it's
just
neither
of
them
knows
what
to
do
exactly,
so
they
work
this
out
between
themselves.
there
is
a
similar
arrangement
that
was
in
existence
for
a
long
time
between
the
gallatin
county,
illinois
coroners
and
their
counterpart.
the
illinois
coroner
handled
the
victims
if
he
was
a
resident
of
illinois.
the
kentucky
coroner
handled
the
rest.
so
again,
i
think
these
sorts
of
situations
fall
far
short
of
what
normally
takes
and
what
this
court
has
found
in
the
past
it
takes
to
establish
a
new
boundary
by
means
of
acquiescence
or
prescription.
finally,
i'd
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
various
instances
where
illinois
has
exercised
jurisdiction
over
part
of
the
river.
one
example
of
this
are
the,
some
78
permits
illinois'
department
of
transportation
has
issued
over
the
last
69
years
governing
a
variety
of
structures
built
from
the
illinois
shore
south
into
the
river.
and
these
permits
were
issued
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
requires
such
a
permit
for
anyone
who
wishes
to
do
any
construction
within
the
public
bodies
of
water
of
illinois.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
actions
of
the
department
of
transportation
is
clear
assertion
that
it
believed
some
part
of
the
waters
of
the
ohio
were
within
illinois,
or
it
wouldn't
have
been
issuing
these
permits
for
the
last
69
years.
kentucky
of
course
says
that
illinois
has
never
exercised
any
jurisdiction
on
the
water,
and
this
i
think
proves
that
that--
mr.
john
brunsman
--yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
agree.
mr.
john
brunsman
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
although
the
special
master's
findings
are
entitled
to
respect
and
a
tacit
presumption
of
correctness,
the
court
nonetheless
has
to
make
an
independent
review
of
each
record
in
an
original
action,
since
it's
really
this
court
and
not
the
special
master
who
is--
mr.
john
brunsman
--well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
read
in
the
cases.
mr.
john
brunsman
i'd
like
you
to
rely
heavily
on
the
tacit
presumption
of
correctness
and--
[laughter]
another
example
of
illinois'
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
the
river
has
to
do
with
the
1927
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
joyce-watkins
case.
that
case
involved
an
accident
that
occurred
on
a
railroad
incline,
and
it
occurred
some
8
to
10
feet
south
of
the
existing
illinois
shoreline.
the
employer
there
argued
that
since
it
took
place
south
of
the
shoreline
it
didn't
take
place
within
the
state
of
illinois,
and
the
illinois
industrial
commission
has
no
jurisdiction.
the
illinois
supreme
court
rejected
that
argument.
it
cited
indiana
v.
kentucky
for
the
proposition
that
the
boundary
was
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwest
side
of
the
river.
but
then
it
also
observed
that
no
commission
between
the
states
had
ever
actually
plotted
that
line,
and
that
the
dispute
before
it
really
wasn't
the
proper
vehicle
for
resolving
an
interstate
boundary
dispute.
what
it
did,
it
was
however
able
to
resolve
the
controversy
because
it
concluded
that
the
low-water
mark
referred
to
in
indiana
v.
kentucky
was
the
record
low-water
mark
at
any
given
point
along
the
river.
in
other
words,
each
time
the
river
got
lower
the
boundary
moved
further
south.
i
would
submit
that
that--
mr.
john
brunsman
--exactly.
and
under
the
way
it
applied
that
rule
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
it
didn't
contemplate
the
boundary
ever
moving
back.
it
would
just,
each
new--
mr.
john
brunsman
--it
would
just
ratchet
further
south.
and
i
submit
that
this
certainly
is
not
an
accurate
interpretation--
mr.
john
brunsman
--exactly.
this
is
the
most
favorable
boundary,
i
think--
mr.
john
brunsman
--it's
mostly
just
water.
mr.
john
brunsman
well,
but
we
haven't
really
picked
up
any
shoreline.
regardless
of
what
line
the
court
would
adopt
in
this
case,
it's
a
water
line
either
way.
i
don't
think
either
state
is
going
to
gain
any
shoreline
one
way
or
the
other,
no
matter
how
it's
concluded.
but
getting
back
to
the
joyce-watkins
case,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
that's
the
most
favorable
possible
version
of
low-water
mark
the
state
could
have
come
up
with.
that
rule
was
cited
by
the
various
authorities
within
the
state
of
illinois
from
1927
through
1973.
i
would
submit
that
that
alone
shows
that
illinois
has
not
acquiesced
to
the
less
favorable
line
that
kentucky
claims
in
this
case.
so
in
summing
up,
illinois'
position
in
this
case
is
first
of
all,
of
course,
that
the
boundary
between
illinois
and
kentucky
is
controlled
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
ohio
v.
kentucky
and
indiana
v.
kentucky.
it
should
be
the
1792
low-water
mark.
kentucky's
defense
of
acquiescence
fails,
i
believe,
first
because
kentucky
authorities
themselves
have
repeatedly
recognized
the
1792
low-water
mark,
and
that
is...
you
can
juxtapose
that
to
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
single
witness
or
document
in
the
record
that
says...
that
kentucky
can
point
to
that
says
it's
the
low-water
mark
as
exists
from
time
to
time.
that,
those
words
appear
in
the
pleadings
before
this
court,
and
nowhere
else
that
i
am
aware
of.
in
addition,
illinois
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
is
evidence
of
confusion
in
both
states,
and
once
again
that's
incompatible
with
a
finding
of
acquiescence
based
on
a
continuous
claim
of
right.
finally,
kentucky
has
based
its
argument
in
part
on
the
suggestion
that
illinois
has
never
exercised
any
jurisdiction
on
the
river.
i
think
there
are
examples
in
the
record
at
least
as
concrete
as
those
kentucky
can
point
to
to
show
that
we
have
exercised
jurisdiction
over
some
part
of
the
river
south
of
the
existing
shoreline.
and
that
all
of
those
factors
add
up
to
a
situation
where
you
simply
do
not
have
acquiescence.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that's
all
i
have.
