justice
david
h.
souter
now,
the
first
of
these
cases
is
no.
106,
original
illinois
versus
kentucky.
we
have
decided
this
case
in
the
exercise
of
the
court's
original
jurisdiction.
the
state
of
illinois
has
filed
the
bill
of
complaint
asking
this
court
to
determine
its
common
boundary
with
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
on
the
ohio
river.
illinois
contends
that
the
boundary
is
the
low
watermark
of
northerly
shore
of
the
river
as
it
was
in
1792
when
kentucky
was
admitted
to
the
union.
kentucky
claims
the
boundary
to
be
the
northerly
low-water
mark
wherever
that
maybe
from
time
to
time.
the
case
was
referred
to
a
special
master
who
reviewed
extensive
evidence
submitted
by
the
parties
and
the
special
master's
report
into
the
court,
he
recommends
that
we
determine
the
boundary
to
be
the
low
watermark
as
of
1792
and
that
we
find
the
record
insufficient
to
support
kentucky's
affirmative
defenses
including
its
claim
to
have
acquired
sovereignty
to
the
river's
northerly
transient
low-water
mark
under
the
doctrine
of
prescription
and
acquiescence.
the
special
master
also
recommends
that
we
find
the
construction
of
dams
on
the
river
has
caused
the
present
low-water
mark
to
the
further
north
and
it
was
in
1792.
finally,
he
recommends
that
we
order
the
common
boundary
of
the
two
states
to
be
determined
as
nearly
at
the
1792
line
as
can
now
be
ascertained.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
by
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
in
large
measure
with
the
special
master's
report.
we
hold
that
the
boundary
between
illinois
and
kentucky
is
the
low-water
mark
in
the
northerly
shore
of
the
ohio
river
as
it
was
in
1792.
and
we
find
that
kentucky
has
failed
to
prove
its
affirmative
defenses
including
its
claim
of
prescription
and
acquiescence.
we
decline
to
find,
however,
that
the
construction
of
dams
on
the
river
has
raised
its
level
beyond
the
1792
level
since
this
issue
can
be
determined
in
setting
the
location
of
the
1792
low-water
mark.
the
report
of
the
special
master
has
adopted
except
for
his
recommendation
as
to
the
effect
of
modern
dams
on
the
actual
low
waterline.
the
case
is
remanded
for
such
further
proceedings
is
maybe
necessary
to
prepare
and
submit
an
appropriate
decree
for
adoption
by
the
court
locating
the
1792
line.
