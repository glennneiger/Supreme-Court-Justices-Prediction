now,
when
you
say
low-water
mark
you
have
to
tell
us
low-water
mark
at
what
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
changing
low-water
mark,
not
the
1792
low-water
mark.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
must
be
for
you
to
win.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
object
if
we
were
to
overrule
that
area
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
case,
wasn't
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
use
a
changing
low-water
mark
as
the
boundary,
what's
the
law
if
a
dam
is
built
or
the
low-water
mark
is
changed
by
an
act
of
one
of
the
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
low-water
mark?
suppose
the
low-water
mark
is
always
much
higher
after
a
dam?
if
the
normal
rule
applies,
is
there
now
a
new
low-water
mark,
even
though
it's
manmade?
