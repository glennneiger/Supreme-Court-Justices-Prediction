we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
106
original,
the
state
of
illinois
v.
the
state
of
kentucky.
mr.
pearson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pearson,
if
you're
not
asking
the
court
to
overrule
ohio
against
kentucky,
then
your
argument
has
to
be
based
on
acquiescence,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
much
of
a
part
does
the
practicalities
of
the
thing
play
in
acquiescence?
i
mean,
don't
you
have
to
show
that
illinois
consented
to
this
boundary,
basically?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
they
acquiesced,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
a
practical
boundary?
and
if
they
didn't
acquiesce,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
a
practical
boundary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
acquiescence?
acquiescence
is
a
state
of
mind
exhibiting
your
willingness
to
abide
by
a
particular
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
that...
did
that
case
turn
on
acquiescence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pearson.
mr.
brunsman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
1896
surveys
deduce
the
1792
low-water
line?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
1896
survey
didn't
purport
to
show
the
1792
low-water
mark;
it
showed
the
1896
low-water
mark?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
50
years
preceding
1896?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
if
it's
deeper
above
the
dams,
one
would
think
it
would
be
shallower
below
the
dams,
because
the
same
amount
of
rainfall
is
falling
on
that
watershed
as
fell
in
1792.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
where
is
the
additional
water
coming
from?
i
mean,
if
it's
wider
on
both
sides
in
some
places,
it
seems
logical
it
must
be
narrower
on
both
sides
in
other
places.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
opposed
to
a
mean
low-water
mark.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ratchet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
about
as
chauvinistic
approach
as
you
can
take.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brunsman.
mr.
pearson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pearson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
