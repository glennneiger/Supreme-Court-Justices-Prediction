justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pearson,
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
ohio
v.
kentucky?
i
mean,
you
do
not
accept
that
ohio
v.
kentucky
sets
forth
the
proper
rule,
even
without
all
the
acquiescence?
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
didn't
know
where
the
1792
low-water
mark
was,
i
guess
i
would
just
operate
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
where
it
is
now,
and
therefore
my
operating
on
that
assumption
would
not
demonstrate
any
acquiescence
whatever.
it
would
demonstrate
only
a
mistake
of
fact,
perhaps.
i
mean,
you
have
to
demonstrate
an
acquiescence
in
the
legal
principle,
right,
not
just
in
a
fact,
but
in
the
legal
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pearson,
if
we
don't
know
where
the
1792...
i
mean,
it's
not
in
the
record.
you
don't
know.
we
don't
know.
i
suppose
the
fellow
who
put
up
the
sign
on
the
bridges
didn't
know
either.
any
of
these
acts
of
acquiescence
that
you're
alleging,
does
any
of
them
involve
a
situation
where
somebody
knows
where
the
1792
line
was,
but
nonetheless
allows...
allows
jurisdiction
beyond
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
single
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
as
far
as
appears,
it
has
just
been
the
operating
assumption
of
illinois
that
the
boundary...
the
boundary
is...
was
where
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
a
fair
enough
operating
assumption.
it
may
have
gone
in
either
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
would
you
expect
them
to
do?
i
mean,
if
it...
if
the
1792
boundary
were
the
line,
how
would
you
expect
them
to
behave
differently?
it
would
seem
to
me
if
i
were
a
coroner
i
would
say,
yeah,
i
know
it's
the
1792
line,
but
nobody
knows
where
the
1792
line
is,
even
mr.
pearson.
he's
been
working
with
this
case
for
a
long
time.
he
doesn't
know...
i'll
just
assume
that
it
is
now
where
it
was
then.
isn't
that
the
way
you'd
operate?
i
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
knew
where
the
1792...
i'm
sorry,
you
did
know
where
it
was.
you
should
have
been
more
careful
about
where
you
put
your
bridge
signs
and
things
of
that
sort.
