well,
at
least
it
makes
it
more
sensible
to
argue
acquiescence
if
it's...
if
acquiescing
was
in
the
public
interest
or
if
it
was
practical
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
would
it
hurt
kentucky?
you
just
don't
know
how
it
would
hurt
you,
kentucky,
if
illinois
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
but
you
don't
know
how?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
purposes
of
fishing
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
know,
though,
you
just
don't
know.
you
just
have
to
surmise
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
course
there
might
be
a
high
probability
that
the
boundary,
that
the
river
has
moved
south,
in
which
event
you
wouldn't
lose
anything
in
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
--has
the
boundary
line
been
established,
to
your
knowledge,
between
ohio
and
kentucky?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
did
that
work
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
river
was
moved
south
some
places
and
north
in
other
places,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
with
indiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
the
same
in
your
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
gain
something.
you
may
gain
some
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
actual
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
doesn't
follow
the
18...
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yeah.
that
doesn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
if
you...
i
would
think
that
if
the
river
moved
a
certain
direction
and
the
boundary
line
is
that
old
low-water
mark,
it
would
be
up
on
the
land
and
you
would
be
having
some
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
your
statement
probably
benefit
the
results
of
those
other
cases
when
they
finally
drew
the
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
there
be
some
chance
that
if
the
boundaries,
the
low-water
mark
as
it
was
back
in
1792,
that
the
river
has
changed
so
that
that
low-water
mark
of
1792
would
be
on
dry
land
on
the
illinois
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
just
as
conceivable
as
if
the
river
moved
the
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
then,
you
don't
think
the
ohio
is
as
much
of
a
meandering
river
as
the
mississippi,
for
example?
it
goes
downhill
faster,
so
it
doesn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the...
is
the
water
above
these
dams
heavily
used
for
recreation?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
a
lot
of
boating
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
fishing?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
ought
to
give
some
deference
to
what
the
master
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would.
but
do
you
find
any
evidence
in
the...
in
our
original
case
opinions
that
if
it's
a
tie
the
vote
goes
to
the
special
master?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
quite
inconsistent,
isn't
it,
to
say
that
there's
a
presumption
but
we
do
it
independently?
justice
byron
r.
white
i've
got
you.
[laughter]
well,
what
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
look
at
all
the
land
you
picked
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
look
at
all
the
shoreline
you
pick
up
when
it
moves
south.
