mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1986
illinois
filed
a
complaint
against
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
in
this
original
action.
in
the
complaint
illinois
alleged
that
kentucky
had
directly
infringed
upon
its
sovereignty
by
exercising
its
boating
and
fishing
laws
north
of
the
1792
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
ohio
river.
prior
to
this
litigation
the
1792
low-water
mark
with
respect
to
illinois
had
never
been
plotted,
designated,
or
otherwise
marked.
and
prior
to
that
action
there
had
never
been
any
boundary
dispute
between
illinois
and
kentucky
or
any
recurring
litigation.
in
the
answer
kentucky
denied
that
it
had
directly
infringed
upon
illinois'
sovereignty.
instead,
kentucky
asserted
that
its
boundary
on
the
ohio
river
is
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river
as
it
exists
from
time
to
time.
in
other
words,
the
current
low-water
mark.
also
in
the
answer
kentucky
raised
two
affirmative
defenses,
one
affirmative
defense
being
that
of
acquiescence,
the
second
affirmative
defense
being
that
of
latches.
kentucky
raised
the
defense
of
acquiescence
because
it
wanted
to
invoke
and
employ
the
basic
teachings
of
georgia
v.
south
carolina,
and
that
is
kentucky
wanted
to
maintain,
and
to
this
day
wants
to
maintain,
the
status
quo
on
the
river.
kentucky
submits
that
the
boundary
between
the
two
states,
as
it
has
been
for
168
years,
is
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river.
by
bringing
the
complaint,
illinois
in
essence
seeks
to
change
this
boundary
and
make
it
the
1792
low-water
mark.
kentucky
submits
that
there
are
many
practical
considerations
with
respect
to
utilizing
the
low-water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
as
the
boundary
between
the
two
states.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
as
it
exists
from
time
to
time,
or
currently.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
correct.
not
the
1792
low-water
mark,
but
the
prevailing,
current
low-water
mark.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
your
honor,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
ohio
v.
kentucky.
we
think
that
the
case
before
this
court
can
be
determined
independently
of
that
particular
situation.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
affirmative.
that's
correct.
if
you
look
at
ohio
v.--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--no,
sir.
we
would
not
object
if
you
were
to
overrule
that
case.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
case.
and
might
i
add,
it
appeared
to
favor
kentucky
with
respect
to
its
argument
here
today.
but
there
are
some
historical
antecedents
and
factors
that
go
into
why
kentucky
has
recognized
the
ever-changing
low-water
mark
on
the
ohio
river
for
168
years.
it
all
starts
back
in
1818
when
you
look
at
the
illinois
enabling
act,
the
1818
constitution
of
illinois,
the
1848
constitution
of
illinois,
and
the
1870
constitution
of
illinois.
all
these
documents,
when
viewed,
conclude
that
the
boundary
between
illinois
and
kentucky
is
the
low-water
mark,
as
those
documents
put
it,
along
the
northwestern
shore,
meaning
the
bank.
perhaps
maybe
the
most
important
notification
that
kentucky
had
with
respect
to
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river
came
from
an
1849
report
of
the
illinois
joint
select
committee
to
investigate
illinois'
boundary
on
the
ohio
river.
that
legislative
body
concluded
that
the
boundary
between
illinois
and
kentucky
is
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river.
kentucky
submits
that
the
conclusion
of
the
joint
select
committee
from
illinois
is
in
keeping
with
the
1820
case
of
handly's
lessee
v.
anthony.
in
the
anthony
case
the
court
was
called
upon
for
the
first
time
to
construe
the
1784
virginia
deed
of
cession
which
gave
lands
to
the
united
states
of
america,
and
thereby
created
kentucky,
illinois,
indiana,
and
ohio.
in
construing
the
1784
cession,
the
court
in
anthony's
lessee
concluded
that
the
boundary
for
kentucky
on
the
ohio
river
is
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northern
side
of
the
river,
or
to
put
it
in
another
term
used
by
the
court,
the
water's
edge.
but
there
were
many
factors
why
the
court
reached
this
conclusion,
one
of
them
being
that
it
would
be
convenient
for
future
population,
because
at
that
time
the
united
states
was
growing.
secondly,
it
was
an
identifiable
boundary
mark
between
the
states.
with
that
in
mind,
kentucky
submits
that
by
using
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river
as
it
exists
from
time
to
time,
or
currently,
or
as
it
prevails,
is
the
most
practical
approach
to
resolving
the
boundary
dispute.
after
all--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
you
do.
you
have
to
show
that
they
acquiesced
in
this
particular
boundary.
you
sure
do.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
your
honor,
i
think
it's...
it's
very
important
that
it's
a
practical
boundary
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
would
best
serve
the
public
convenience.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
look
back
at
vermont
v.
new
hampshire,
which
was
decided
in
1933,
the
court
in
vermont
v.
new
hampshire
looked
at
the
practical
considerations
for
the
public
convenience.
they
looked
to
see,
first
of
all--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
and
it
had
to
do
with
the
location
of
the
boundary
between
vermont
and
new
hampshire
on
the
western...
the
western
low-water
mark
on
the
vermont
side
of
the
connecticut
river.
it
turned
on
acquiescence.
the
court
there
looked
at
the
conduct
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
issue
of
acquiescence.
and
acquiescence,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
to
use
the
largely
identifiable
western
low-water
mark
on
the
vermont
side
of
the
connecticut
river,
looked
at
the
practicalities
of
it.
kentucky
would
submit
that
looking
at
the
practicalities
in
this
situation,
likewise,
is
very
important.
i
think
if
we
look
at
some
of
the
practicalities
and
how
they
have
impacted
upon
the
interaction
between
officials
from
both
kentucky
and
illinois,
then
i
think
we
can
bring
home
closer
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
that's
precisely
our
point.
for
instance,
if
we
look
at
the
bridges
that
cross
the
ohio
river
between
illinois
and
kentucky,
there
are
four
of
them.
basically
a
bridge
that
was
constructed
in
1929,
the
brookport
bridge,
1938
the
cairo
bridge,
which,
that's
what
they
call
it
in
illinois,
they
don't
call
it
cairo,
the
1956
shinytown
bridge,
and
the
1974
interstate
24
bridge.
with
respect
to
the
interstate
24
bridge,
in
1971
a
construction
agreement
was
entered
between
illinois
and
kentucky,
and
with
respect
to
that
agreement
it
was
concluded
that
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
would
be
the
north
normal
pool
line,
loosely
translated
the
low-water
mark.
it
did
not
say,
it
did
not
specify
1792.
kentucky
submits
that
it's
talking
about
the
prevailing
or
current
normal
pool
line
on
the
river.
likewise,
we
see
the
same
kind
of
situation
with
respect
to
illinois
and
kentucky
entering
into
a
maintenance
agreement
regarding
the
cairo
bridge,
which
was
constructed
in
1938.
in
1954
kentucky
and
illinois
officials
corresponded
regarding
where
to
place
the
sign
on
the
bridge
indicating
when
you
are
going
to
be
entering
illinois
or
leaving
kentucky.
and
between
this
correspondence
one
of
the
district
engineers
for
illinois
concluded,
after
looking
at
the
1936
construction
plan,
that
the
area
located
on
that
construction
plan
was
about
as
close
enough
to
the
theoretical
line
as
it
could
be.
kentucky
had
that
1936
plan
analyzed
by
one
of
its
bridge
engineers
and
of
course
that
plan
indicated
that
the
boundary
was
at
pier
b,
station
20
plus
10.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
that's
construction
talk,
the
bottom
line
is
when
you
look
at
it
it's
the
same
as
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northern
side
of
the
river.
consequently
illinois
has
been
on
notice
for
quite
some
time,
especially
with
respect
to
the
1849
agreement,
a
joint
select
committee
conclusion
that
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river
is
indeed
the
boundary.
likewise
there
was
other
situations
which
have
come
into
play
to
show
that
kentucky
is
exercising
its
jurisdiction
and
its
dominion
to
the
north
low-water
mark
on
the
ohio
river.
for
instance,
kentucky
counties
that
bound...
that
border
on
the
river
have
the
right
in
the
authority
under
kentucky's
1810
statute,
and
the
case
law
that
has
interpreted
it,
to
lease
the
river
bed
to
the
thread
or
the
middle
of
the
stream.
as
a
result
of
that
subsequent
decisions
by
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
or
the
highest
court
in
kentucky
at
that
time,
concluded
that
the
state
of
kentucky
likewise
has
the
authority
to
lease
the
bed
of
the
river
from
the
middle
of
the
stream
to
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river.
and
that's
exactly
what
kentucky
has
done.
before
the
special
master
there
is
evidence
that
kentucky
has
entered
into
agreements
with
private
companies
for
the
leasing
of
the
river
bed
for
dredging
of
sand
and
gravel.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
indiana.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
correct.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
your
question,
it
would
create
an
inconsistent
boundary.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
with
respect
to
that
conclusion...
which
it
would.
it
would
create
an
inconsistent
boundary.
but
there
are
some
factors
to
be
concerned.
maybe
perhaps
the
bright-line
principle
that
would
allow
kentucky
to
fashion
the
boundary
as
it
argues
today,
which
has
been
recognized
for
168
years,
is
california
v.
nevada.
i
think
the
bright-line
principle
in
that
case
is
that
there
is
no
particular
relationship
between
the
origins
of
a
boundary
and
the
legal
consequences
of
acquiescence
in
that
boundary.
in
other
words,
for
168
years
it
has
been
no
problem
between
illinois
and
kentucky.
even
as
i
speak
today,
the
boundary
on
the
river
which
the
parties
or
the
people
who
work
on
that
river
recognize,
is
the
low-water
mark.
we
haven't
had
any
problems
with
it
for
168
years,
even
though
it
has
been
different
than
the
1792
low-water
mark.
i
think
the...
at
present
the
kentucky
legislature,
with
respect
to
promulgating
in
its
revised
statutes
the
description
of
the
boundary
now,
talks
in
terms
of
allowing
the
low-water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
intersect
with
the
present
1792
low-water
mark
as
we
know
it
from
ohio
v.
kentucky,
and
of
course
kentucky
v.
indiana.
merely,
the
point
being
is
that
there
has
been
no
problem
up
until
this
lawsuit
was
filed
regarding
the
boundary
between
the
two
states.
at
present
kentucky
enforces
its
boating
and
fishing
laws
on
the
entire
river
to
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river
at
the
low-water
mark.
for
instance,
with
respect
to
fishing
licenses,
the
testimony
before
the
special
master
showed
that
if
an
individual
is
fishing
in
the
ohio
river,
then
kentucky
officials
will
check
that
person
for
his
or
her
license.
but
if
that
person
is
fishing
from
the
bank
the
kentucky
officials
will
not.
moreover
the
officials
from
kentucky
testified
that
there
are
no
illinois
water
patrol
or
fish
and
wildlife
personnel
on
the
river.
only
kentucky
is
the
state
that
patrols
that
river
and
enforces
the
fishing
and
boating
laws
on
that
river.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
think,
your
honor,
i
think
you're
speaking
with
respect
to
a
survey
that
was
done
by
illinois
with
respect
to
that.
we
don't...
we
cannot
concede
that
that
is
possible
or
that
is
the
case.
we
don't...
we
don't
know
the
impact
with
respect
to
what
dams
have
done
to
the
river
and
perhaps
that
issue
might
be
premature
and
be
appropriate
if
this
court
concludes
that
kentucky
does
not
prevail.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that
may
well
be
true,
your
honor,
but
in
the
complaint
they
allege
that
it
was
the
1792
low-water
mark.
i
have
to
take
them--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--it
could
have
been.
and
i
think
you're
talking
about
basically
the
principles
of
accretion
and
erosion.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
kentucky
submits,
just
as
it
has
with
respect
to
illinois
recognizing
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river,
because
it
has
waited
168
years
in
which
to
bring
this
action,
that
it
has
in
essence
acquiesced
likewise
to
the
application
of
the
principles
of
accretion
and
erosion.
in
other--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--and
i
think
we
have
with
respect
to
inaction
for
a
long
period
of
time.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
one
of
the
considerations.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
think
it
could
hurt
us
in
many
regards.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
think
i
do.
if
illinois
were
to
prevail,
is
that
your
question?
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
think
i
would.
first
of
all--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--first
of
all
it
would
be
with
respect
to
the
issuance
and
the
selling
of
fishing
licenses.
number
one,
which--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--well,
if
the
boundary...
let's
predicate
on
the
assumption.
if
the
boundary
is
the
1792
low-water
mark
as
illinois
alleges
in
its
brief,
which
means
that
the
boundary
is
no
longer
the
shoreline
but
moves
out
into
the
waterway,
then
obviously
because
of
the
geographical
location
of
that
boundary
which
illinois
says
is
the
boundary
between
the
two
states,
we're
going
to
give
up
some
of
the
river.
and
consequently
fishing--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--fishing
jurisdiction.
maybe
for
that
fact
dredging
with
respect
to
sand
and
gravel,
if
they
want
to
dredge
along
the
northern...
northwestern
shore.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that
would
appear
to
be,
based
upon
the
historical
facts
on
the
river
that
that's
a
high
probability.
so,
yeah.
i
don't
know,
but--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--that's
true.
of
course
there's
a
probability
that
it
could
have
moved
north.
and
if
it
has
then
we
probably
lose
a
lot
more.
but
the
movement
of
the
river,
i
think
at
this
point
in
time
with
respect
to
trying
to
say
that
it's
the
1792
low-water
mark
or
that
it's
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river,
perhaps
is
a
little
premature
and
would
definitely
be
a
vast
and
important
consideration
when
trying
to
geodetically
plot
where
we
think
it
is
if
kentucky
does
not
prevail.
i
think
that's
where
it
has
its
most
important
function.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that
is
correct.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
well,
if...
that's,
that's
true,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
certain
line,
and
that's
the
line
that
kentucky
and
both
illinois
have
recognized
for
168
years.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
correct.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
surely
we
know
if
it
does
move
more
northward--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--that's
correct.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that
worked
out
as
the
result
of
a
stipulation--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we
have--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--same
with
indiana,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--i
think
what
we
have
right
now--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--well,
the
way
the
parties--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--the
way
the
parties
stipulated
was
that
when
it
gets
too
close
to
ground
they
move
it
100
feet
out.
that's
not
to
kentucky's
benefit.
right
now
the
boundary
with
respect
to
ohio
and
kentucky,
as
it
has
been
agreed
between
the
parties,
takes
a
zig-zagging
course.
no
one
knows
exactly
still
where
it
is.
and
when
it
gets
too
close
to
land
the
parties
by
agreement
stipulated
that
it
would
move
out
100
feet.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
we
didn't
pick
up--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--handly's
lessee
in
1820?
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
think
perhaps
the
boundary
as
we
know
it
based
upon
the
7...
the
1792
low-water
mark
with
respect
to
ohio
and
kentucky
has
resulted
purely
from
stipulation
and
agreement
between
the
states.
and
so
they
tried
to
do
as
best
they
could
with
what
they
could
find,
even
with
regard
to
speculation
by
knowledgeable
surveyors
as
to
where
they
think
the
boundary
is.
kentucky
didn't
pick
up
anything
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
it
does
not.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
no,
your
honor--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--i
don't
think
it's
been
an
operating
assumption,
your
honor,
especially
if
you
look
at
the
1849
illinois
joint
select
committee
and
what
they
did.
that
was
their
job
to
make
a
determination
where
the
boundary
is.
they
concluded
it's
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river.
they
had
an
ample
opportunity
at
that
time
to
say,
oh,
it's
the
1792
low-water
mark.
they
did
not
find
such.
consequently,
i
think
kentucky
has
correctly
utilized
the
low-water
mark
and
illinois
has
acquiesced
to
it
being
the
17...
not...
being
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river.
that's
true,
locating
it
would
probably
be
extremely
difficult.
the
parties
in
the
two
prior
actions
stipulated
where
they
thought
maybe
it
would
be.
with
respect
to
the...
illinois'
complaint
i
think
also
points
it
out.
illinois
in
its
complaint
alleges
that
kentucky
directly
infringed
upon
its
sovereignty
by
exercising
its
jurisdiction
or
dominion
to
the
shoreline.
once
again,
i
think
that
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
it
has
always
been
that.
it's
identifiable.
it's
concrete.
there
is
no
guessing
for
people
who
work
and
live
on
that
river
everyday.
there
is
nothing
about
maybe
geodetically
plotted
the
river
runs,
the
boundary
runs
this
way
or
meanders
that
way.
when
a
person
is
on
the
riverbank
fishing
or
a
person
puts
that
pole
in
the
water,
they
know
where
it
is.
to
give
you
another
example
as
to
how
kentucky
has
exercised
dominion
and
control
over
the
river,
from
1946
to
1988
kentucky
had
a
special
license
called
the
ohio
river
commercial
and
sport
fishing
license.
this
license
was
purchased
exclusively
and
available
only
for
residents
of
illinois,
ohio,
and
indiana.
we
sold
it
exclusively
to
them
so
they
could
fish
the
ohio
river.
in
1988
the
regulations
were
amended
such
that
kentucky
would
then
have
a
new
license
called
a
nonresident
fishing
license,
meaning
that
illinois
residents
could
purchase
the
license,
just
like
any
other
resident
of
a...
from
a
state
other
than
kentucky.
and,
but
in
either
case
kentucky
was
selling
those
licenses
particularly
to
illinois
official...
illinois
individuals
or
inhabitants
so
they
could
fish
on
the
river.
this
once
again
shows
you
what
has
been
going
on
for
quite
some
time
on
the
river
in
terms
of
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
river
to
the
low-water
mark.
to
show
you
one
other
example,
kentucky's
fishing
laws
allows
that
it
be--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--if
it's
south
of
the
low-water
mark.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
that's
correct.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
don't
either.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
of
course
if
they
fish
north
of
the
low-water
mark,
one
would
have
to
assume
they
would
have
to
get
an
illinois
license,
but
right
now
we're
selling
those
licenses
with
respect
to
having
accessibility
to
the
ohio
river.
and--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--i
think
we
have
to
first
classify
what
that
conduct
would
be
by
kentucky
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
some
kind
of
accretion
or
whether
or
not
it's
evulsive
in
nature.
because
if
it's
evulsive
in
nature,
and
is
sudden,
which
usually
is
in
terms
of
an
earthquake,
then
of
course
because
the
river
would
shift,
the
shift
of
the
river
would
not
divest
the
states
that
had
certain
properties--
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
--that
is.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
well,
we
have...
we
have
an
affidavit
indicating
from
our
surveyor
that
the
river
has
not
changed
very
much
at
all.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
of
course
finding
some
of
that
evidence
is
one
of
the
problems
we
have
because
of
the
inaction
on
the
part
of
illinois
in
bringing
suit
168
years
later.
it
has
a
deleterious
effect
upon
the
quality
of
evidence
presented.
i
think
that's
another
practical
consideration
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
acquiescence
has
been
shown.
finally,
i
think
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
indicating
that
when
a
person
drowns
in
the
ohio
river,
if
that
body
is
located
in
the
river
the
kentucky
coroners
will
exercise
jurisdiction
over
it.
however,
illinois
coroners
will
not.
if
the
body
is
brought
to
the
bank
on
the
illinois
side
they
will
exercise
jurisdiction
over
it.
sometimes
the
illinois
coroners
will
seek
the
permission
of
the
kentucky
coroners
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
body.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
the
practical
choice
of
all,
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side.
then
you
don't
have
to
guess
at
all.
just
like
with...
in...
with
the
connecticut
river.
there
would
be
no
guessing.
there
would
have
to
be
no
assumptions.
with
that
in
mind,
your
honor,
if
there
are
any
more
questions--
thank
you.
mr.
rickie
leon
pearson
i
do.
thank
you
very
much.
with
respect
to
the
78
permits
issued
by
illinois
officials,
kentucky
would
indicate
from
the
outset
that
it
cannot
stop
illinois
from
systematically
developing
its
shoreline
or
its
bank.
in
other
words,
those
riparians
along
the
bank
have
those
rights.
this
is
exactly
the
teachings
in
new
jersey
v.
delaware.
because
you
allow
the
development
of
the
illinois
shoreline,
just
like
in
new
jersey
v.
delaware,
the
state
which
allows
that
does
not
abandon
the
defense
of
acquiescence.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
joyce-watkins
case
which
was
the
illinois
case,
as
indicated
in
vermont
v.
new
hampshire,
only
the
u.s.
supreme
court
can
determine
the
boundary.
the
illinois
appellate
court
cannot
determine
that
boundary.
furthermore,
if
you
read
the
joyce-watkins
case
extremely
closely,
you'll
find
out
that
they
recognized
that
the
boundary
is
a
moving
boundary,
which
is
consistent
with
our
theory
that
it's
the
low-water
mark
wherever
it
may
exist
from
time
to
time.
finally,
with
respect
to
illinois'
argument
that
there
is
uncertainty
regarding
where
the
boundary
is
located,
this
court
can
end
that
uncertainty.
it
can
conclude
that
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
is
the
low-water
mark
on
the
northwestern
side
of
the
river,
which
everyone
can
see.
every
fisherperson
can
see.
every
person
having
a
boat
on
the
river
can
see.
with
that
in
mind,
your
honors,
thank
you.
