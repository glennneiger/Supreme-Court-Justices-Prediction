mr.
pearson,
isn't
it
possible
that
the
boundary
is
actually
on
the
land
north
of
where
the
water
is,
under
illinois'
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
maybe...
isn't
it
possible
the
river
has
moved
to
the
south
rather
than
to
the
north?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
point
is
that
all
this
activity
rely
on...
say
illinois
allowed
all
the
policing
and
what
went
on
on
the
water
itself.
maybe
they
assumed
that
was
part
of
kentucky
because
they
don't
really
know
exactly
where
the
1792
boundary
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
i'm
just
saying
if
you
don't
know
where
it
is,
conceivably...
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
geography.
but
conceivably
the
1792,
the
river
was
10
miles
north
of
cairo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
correct
that
we...
the
record
does
not
yet
tell
us
which
direction,
if
either,
the
river
has
moved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
isn't...
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
5050
proposition.
they
want
a
certain
line,
but
you
don't
know
whether
that...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
can
really
tell
whether
that
line
will
hurt
one
state
or
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you're
saying
the
certain
line
is
a
line
that
changes
from
time
to
time,
and
wherever
it
is
at
a
particular
time,
that
governs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
are
arguing
for
a
permanent
line.
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
permanent
line
is
more
favorable
to
one
state
or
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
moves
north
it's
more
favorable
to
your
side,
if
it
moves
south
it's
more
favorable
to
the
other
side.
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
in
that...
even
on
that
example,
if
any
portion
of
the
river
in
which
they
intended
to
fish
was
south
of
the
boundary,
they'd
need
a
kentucky
license.
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
would
think
most
fish...
i
don't
know
where
the,
where
you
get
the
most
fish
out
of
this
river,
but
i
would
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--most
people
would
need
a
kentucky
license,
no
matter...
unless
the
boundary
had
moved,
you
know,
the
whole
breadth
of
the
river.
another
question
occurs
to
me--
--and
especially
since
they
don't
know
where
the
boundary
is
any
more
than
you
do.
[laughter]
they
know
there
are
a
lot
of
kentucky
game
wardens
out
there
and
they
want
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
would
happen
under
your
view
of
the
case
if
kentucky
decided
to
fill
out
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
cause
the
river
to
bend
farther
to
the
north?
would
they
acquire
territory
by
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
view
isn't
that
the
proper
line
is
as
it
exists
from
time
to
time.
it's
as
it
exists
from
time
to
time,
excluding
all
examples
of
evulsion.
that's
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you...
even
under
your
theory
you've
got
to
go
back
100
years
and
find
out
how
many
evulsive
changes
took
place,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
much.
but
if
there
are
any
evulsive
changes,
in
order
to
find
the
boundary
you
would
have
to
know
what
they
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
bet
they're
paying
taxes
now.
[laughter]
