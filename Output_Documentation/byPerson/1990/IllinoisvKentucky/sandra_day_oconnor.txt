mr.
pearson,
i
guess
kentucky
has
boundaries
along
the
ohio
river
with
ohio
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--indiana
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
i
assume
if
somehow
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
there
has
been
acquiescence
here
for
the
illinois
boundary,
that
would
mean
the
boundary
is
someplace
else
with
respect
to
indiana
and
ohio?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
quite.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
brunsman,
did
something
occur
that
prompted
illinois
to
file
the
suit
that
it
did
after
all
these
years?
