kennedy
in
some
cases
i
assume
the
person
to
whom
the
process
is
served
upon
will
have
no
knowledge
of,
really,
the
subject
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation.
justice
kennedy
if
that
is
so,
why
shouldn't
the
government
have
the
burden
to
show
conceivable
relevance,
at
least
in
that
instance?
justice
kennedy
how
can
the
person
upon
whom
the
process
is
served
possibly
meet
that
standard?
justice
kennedy
are
the
search
and
seizure
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment
applicable
here?
