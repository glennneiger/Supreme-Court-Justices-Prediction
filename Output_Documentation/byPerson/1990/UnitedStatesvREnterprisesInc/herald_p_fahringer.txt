mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
absolutely
critical
in
this
whole
criminal
justice
system
at
the
very
least
that
we
maintain
a
mechanism
whereby
a
citizen
can
come
into
a
court
of
law
who
has
received
a
subpoena,
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
most
respectfully
that
this
is
a
very,
very
small
minority
of
the
cases,
and
register
a
constitutional
complaint
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
first
amendment,
or
even
under
rule
17(c),
all
of
which
may
coalesce,
and
say
the
government
has
no
right
to
take
my
private
papers,
and
make
a
showing.
i
don't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
the,
at
that
juncture
by
simply
raising
those
complaints
and
doing
it
in
the
fashion
we
did
here
with
affidavits
that
ran
some
45
pages,
that
all
that
is
required
is
a
standard
whereby
which
the
government
stands
up
in
that
circumstance
and
the
court
either
says
yes,
i
believe
the
grieved
party
has
made
out
a
complaint
here,
and
you
should
give
some
indication,
even
in
ex
parte,
even
minimal,
but
you
must
give
me
some
indication
as
to
why
it
is
these
records
are
relevant
based
on
the
affidavits
that
have
been
supplied
with
it.
if
the
judge
then
concludes,
i
believe
they
have
made
the
substantial
showing,
that
may
well
be
the
end
of
it.
in
this--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--yes,
judge,
i
do,
and
let
me
tell
you--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
just...
the
court
of
appeals
said
our
only
concern
with
respect
to
the
business
records
requested
from
model,
r.
enterprises,
and
mfr
is
the
relevancy
of
those
documents
to
the
grand
jury's
investigation.
now
most
unhappily,
your
honor,
and
i
am
sure
the
court
is
embarrassed
by
this,
that
is
to
say
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
have
to,
your
honor,
set
forth
facts
as
to
why
i
believe
there
is
at
least
a
basis
for
making
the
government...
in
our
case,
your
honor,
we
came
in
and
it
has
never
been
disputed;
this
little
bookstore
in
brooklyn
does
no
business
in
virginia.
your
honor,
r.
enterprises--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--the
burden
we
have,
your
honor,
is
a
reasonable
showing
that
there
is
absolutely
no
relevance
for
the
records
requested.
i
could
give
you
a
hypothetical
where--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
a
reasonable
showing,
your
honor,
that
we
feel
there
is
no
basis
for
requiring
us
to
turn
all
of
our
records
over
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
think,
your
honor,
it
can
be
done
in
an
affidavit
either
by
the
lawyer
or
by
the
defendant,
at
least--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
instance
we
indicated
in
our
papers
we
had
conducted
an
investigation,
but
judge...
they
never
really
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
our
papers.
from
time
to
time
the
mention
was
made
that
it
was
done
on
lawyer's
affidavits.
that's
the
way
i
had
always
done
it.
but
no
one
ever
really
moved
to
dismiss
these
papers
because
it
wasn't
on
the
defendant's
affidavit.
did
the
government
make
any,
ever
offer
to
explain
why--
--your
honor,
their
position
was
all
along,
their
official
stance
was
we
don't
have
to
show
relevance,
your
honor.
now,
i
want
to
be
fair
and
say
that
from
time
to
time
there
were
suppositions,
there
was
some
hypotheticals,
it
may
well
be
we
want
to
know
what
other
companies
mr.
rothstein
has.
but
the
third
circuit
said,
but
you
never
indicated
that
mfr
was
doing
any
business
in
virginia,
you
never
indicated
that
they
were
engaged
in
any
kind
of
conduct
that
would
give
jurisdiction
in
virginia,
or
were
not
full
outside
their
powers
of
investigation.
and
i
think
that
was
a
fair
conclusion.
in
most
cases,
your
honor,
i
am
convinced,
i
am
convinced
that
in
most
district
courts
the
prosecutor
will
come
forward
and
he
will
make,
in
every
single
case,
i
believe,
that
is
reported
in
our
briefs,
the
government
has
made
such
a
showing.
they
have
either
met
the
standard
of
a
substantial
showing
in
a
first
amendment
case
or
a
reasonable
showing
in
a
fourth
amendment
case.
the
records
were
directed
to
be
produced.
they
were
produced.
they're
content--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--your
honor,
they
were
shown
that
he
owned
all
of
the
companies,
but--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--but
i
don't
think
that's
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say,
as
the
third
circuit
said,
that--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i'm
sorry.
forgive
me,
your
honor,
i'm
talking
about
the
fourth
circuit.
i
apologize.
the
fourth
circuit
indicated
that
because
the
man
owns
several
companies,
there
is
no
logical
inference
from
that
that
mfr,
this
bookstore
in
brooklyn,
is
doing
business
in
virginia
or
shipping
books
to
virginia.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
but
judge,
they
showed
nothing,
except
that
one
man
owned
them
all.
if
they
came
forward--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
would
be
a
sounder
rule
for
the
litigation
of
these
matters
is
for
a
prosecutor
to
come
in
and
say
your
honor,
we
think
those
records
will
show
that
this
company,
mfr,
is
engaged
in
a
conspiracy--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
your
honor,
it
isn't.
what
i
really...
i
am
not
asking
for
anything
as
much
as
that.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
think,
your
honor,
instead
of...
we
are
entitled,
instead
of
a
prosecutor
coming
in
and
saying
we
don't
have
to
show
relevance,
that
they
show
some
relevance.
and
they
can
do
it,
your
honor,
verbally.
they
can
make
the
assertion--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--your
honor,
in
this
instance
i'll
give
you
an
example.
if
they
had
facts,
and
i
would
assume
as
a
responsible
u.s.
attorney
they
would
stand
up
and
they
would
say,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
records
of
the
mfr
books
will
indicate
that
they
are
shipping
books
to
virginia.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
they
are.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
am
not
suggesting,
your
honor--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
what
i
am
asking
for
is
that
they
give
some
indication
to
the
court
as
to
why
mfr's
records
would
be
relevant
to
the
investigation,
not
disclose
the
nature
of
their
investigation.
and
your
honors,
in
all
due
respect,
i
think
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
even
though
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
feel
they
had
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case
and
decided
it
on
relevancy
grounds,
we
have
argued
the
first
amendment
from
the
beginning
here.
this
is
an
investigation
into
books
and
film
themselves.
this
isn't
tangential,
and
these
records
are
intimately
involved
with
the
distribution
of
books.
we
stood
before
the
courts
in
the
district
court
and
we
said
your
honor,
without
some
showing,
and
please
understand--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether...
they
have
never,
your
honor,
established
in
any
way...
the
fourth
circuit
has,
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
twice
now
that
you
haven't
even
shown
the
relevance
of
these
tapes
as
being
obscene.
they
come
in
there
and
they
say
by
the
titles
we
think
they
are
obscene,
and
the
fourth
circuit
says,
we
don't
think
that
is
enough.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
concede,
your
honor,
that
they
do
not
have
to
establish
admissibility
for
a
grand
jury.
i
was
about
to
say
to
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
you
read
this
opinion
they
say
our
main
concern
is
relevancy.
at
the
end
of
that
section
they
say,
and
we
note
in
passing
that
as
far
as
mr.
rothstein
is
concerned,
in
all
likelihood
the
mfr
bookstore
up
in
brooklyn
wouldn't
even
be
admissible
in
a
trial
down
here.
i
don't
think
that
by
any
means
is
a
holding
of
the
case.
the
holding
of
the
case
is
they
found
that
there
was
no
showing
of
any
kind
that
these
records
were
relevant.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all,
because
judge--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--if
i
can
answer
that
question,
what
they
did
in
this
case
was
we
have
to
deliver...
your
honor,
it
has
been
affirmed,
50,000
records
of
model,
model
distributors
is
going
to
have
to
deliver
50,000
of
their
business
records.
those
records
aren't
all
admissible.
the
third
circuit,
i
think
it's
an
insult
to
the
scholarship
of
that
court
to
suggest
that
they
meant
that
all
of
model's
records
had
to
be
admissible
as
well.
they
obviously
found
them
to
be
relevant,
but
they
may
never
be
admissible
at
trial,
50,000
documents
that
we
are
going
to
comply
with.
and
incidentally
in
this
case,
from
the
day
we
received
the
subpoena
we
have
turned
over
every
single
piece
of
paper--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
forgive
me
if
i
lost
my
composure.
from
the
beginning
of
this
case
we
turned
over
every
single
document
of
model,
the
first
person
subpoenaed,
that
had
anything
to
do
with
virginia.
we
gave
them
every
invoice
of
every
sale
down
there.
we
gave
them
our
tax
returns.
we
gave
them
our
business
corporate
records.
what
we
said
is
we
don't
think
we
should
have
to
turn
over
400,000
pages
of
records
of
who
we
sell
in
vermont
or
new
hampshire
or
new
york
or
connecticut
or
anyplace
else.
that
is
what
we
were...
and
ultimately
the
government
to
a
degree
agreed
with
us
on
that.
then
when
we
came
in
on
mfr
books
we
took
the
position
that
you
ought
to
make
some
preliminary
showing
at
least,
after
we
raised
these
charges,
after
we
file
affidavits
and
indicate
there
is
no
relationship,
you
ought
to
come
forward
at
least
and
indicate
how
it
is
that
there
is
some--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--they
are,
judge,
in
the
court
of
appeals
appendix--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--which
i
believe
has
been
transmitted
to
this
court.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
eight
copies
of
that.
and
we
go
on
and
on
at
great
length
on
this
matter.
incidentally,
your
honors,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
consider
that
there
is
a
pattern
here,
a
very
unhappy
pattern
of
coming
in
the
first
time
around
and
saying
that
we
should
turn
over
every
single
tape
in
the
place
to
a
grand
jury
down
there
without
any,
any
allegations
that
they
are
obscene.
and
we
were
sustained
on
that.
the
fourth
circuit
wrote
a
very
lengthy
opinion,
and
no
one
sought
review
in
this
court.
and
they
have,
as
they
stand
here
today
in
this
court,
to
indicate
yes,
we
were
wrong
on
that.
and
the
400,000
records
that
they
wanted
of
model,
they
ultimately
pulled
back
from
that.
and
the
second
time
around,
when
they
wanted
193
tapes
without
any
allegation
the
tapes
were
obscene,
we
were
sustained
on
that
as
well,
and
they
haven't
sought
review
in
this
court,
for
that
matter.
so
that
there
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
matter
of
record
of,
call
it
what
you
will,
overreaching,
overzealousness,
or
bad
faith,
whatever
you
want.
but
this
is
the
way
this
case
ended
up
in
the
fourth
circuit.
and
i
believe
that
did
have
some
influence
on
the
court,
when
they
said,
now,
what
do
you
want
the
records
from
a
bookstore
in
brooklyn
for
down
before
your
grand
jury.
and
when
they
took
the
position
we
don't
have
to
say,
we
don't
have
to
give
any
reason,
i
believe
the
court
correctly
concluded
that
that
was
inappropriate.
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
in
all
fairness
the
price
to
pay
for
preserving
the
right
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
first
amendment,
because
i
believe
as
deeply
as
i
stand
here
that
this
is
a
pure
first
amendment
case
and
the
consequences
of
this
case,
if
anybody
can
come
in
and
not
make
any
showing
at
all,
and
the
impact
this
would
have
of
us
giving
up
our
customers,
our
suppliers,
and
the
inhibitions
and
the
chilling
effect
that
that
would
have
would
set
an
awful
dangerous
precedent.
what
it
would
be
a
much
better
rule
is
to
simply
hold
that
in
these
cases
a
prosecutor
must
make
some
showing.
if
he
makes
a
showing
and
he
satisfies
the
judge,
and
let
me
say
very
candidly
to
the
court
it's
a
very
flexible
standard,
and
i
suspect
that
a
great
many
district
judges
will
be
satisfied
with
their
representation,
then
that
will
be
the
end
of
it,
and
they
will
have
satisfied
their
burden.
no
one
is
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
we
don't
have
to
turn
over
all
of
these
records,
that
we
won't
have
to
deliver
them.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
there
ought
to
be
at
the
very
least
some
indication
as
to
how
they
are
relevant.
and
once
they
meet
that,
and
they
have
done
it
in
all
the
other
cases,
the
cases
that
have
come
up
here
before
you
and
in
the
circuit
courts
where
contempt
convictions
have
been
affirmed,
they
have
met
that
standard.
wouldn't
that
be
a
much
better
rule
than
to
say,
and
to
abolish
a
rule,
to
say
that
prosecutors
never
have
to
make,
even
in
a
first
amendment
case,
any
showing
of
relevance
whatsoever.
and
for
all
those
reasons,
your
honor,
i
would
most
respectfully--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--your
honor,
you
are
partially
correct.
what
they
said
is,
and
it
was
stipulated,
that
these
companies
are
all
owned
by
martin
rothstein.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
don't
believe
it
was
ever
said
they
are
similar.
they
are
all,
obviously,
the
bookstore
sells
adult
material.
r.
enterprises
also
distributes
adult
material.
what
we
said
is
that
r.
enterprises
and
mfr
books
have
never
sold
anything
in
new
jersey,
have
never
bought
anything
from
new
jersey,
have
never
had
any
dealings
with...
i
am
sorry,
with
virginia
whatsoever.
and
as
a
consequence
the
fourth
circuit
then
held
that
they
thought
there
had
to
be
more
facts
supplied
to
the
district
judge
than
just
that
one
man
owned
the
three
companies.
i
also
want
to,
in
all
candor,
your
honor,
tell
you
that
throughout
the
proceeding
they
did
from
time
to
time
indicate
collaterally
gee,
well
maybe
there
might
be
a
conspiracy
here,
or
they
might
have
said
at
times
that
we'd
like
to
know
more
about
what
mr.
rothstein
owns.
none
of
the
district
court
judges
relied
upon
that.
all
the
district
court
judges
relied
upon
was
the
common
ownership
of
all
three
companies
by
the
same
person,
your
honor.
and
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
wasn't
sufficient,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
either,
certainly
not
in
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
but
your
honor,
it
has
never
been
disputed
by
the
government,
and
the
government
never
stood
up
and
said--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--but
your
honor,
what
we're
saying
is...
all
we
believe
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
say
to
a
district
judge
is...
your
honor,
we
believe,
instead
of
agreeing
with
us
and
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
do
business
down
here
or
not,
we
believe
they
should
have
been
required
to
say
either
one,
we
think
the
records
will
show
they
do
do
business
down
here,
and
that
is
why
we
want
them,
and
that
may
have
been
the
end
of
it
right
then
and
there.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
judge,
i
think--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--no.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
because,
your
honor,
i
think
it
requires
more.
if
we
come
forward
with
affidavits
in
good
faith
as
officers
of
the
court
and
indicate,
and
they
don't
dispute
it,
and
simply
say
well,
we
want
to
be
sure,
i
think
that
is
inadequate.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
judge,
what,
i
think--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i'm
sorry.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
say
is
this.
i
think
some
representations
have
to
be
made
to
the
district
court
to
contravene,
or
controvert
what
we
say.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
you
know,
and
i
quote
your
honor
from
the
record,
when
one
of
the
district
judges
said
to
the
prosecutor
what
do
you
hope
to
find
in
the
mfr
records,
he
says
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
district
judge
was
putting
the
question
what
do
you
think
that
would
turn
up?
how
is
it
you
think
that
it's
relevant?
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
they
win.
i
think--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--because
they
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
they
never
made
those
representations
to
the
court.
what
they
said
is
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
do
business
down
there,
we
just
want
to
see
the
records.
that
was
the
difference.
it's
a
critical
factual
difference,
your
honor?
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
your
honor,
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--yes,
judge.
of
course
it
would,
your
honor.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
this.
if
they
come
in
and
had
said
to
that
judge
your
honor,
we
believe
that
mfr
books
is
in
some
way
involved
with
distribution
of
books
down
here,
even--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
don't
think
that's
enough.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
a
good
faith
basis
for
arguing
that
it's
relevant.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
it
would
either
be
through
their
investigation,
through
informants,
through--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
i
conclude
my
argument.
thank
you.
