justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1436,
united
states
v.
r.
enterprises.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
our
case
of
walling
v.
oklahoma
press
publishing
company,
which
is
the
leading
case
for
administrative
subpoenas,
pretty
much
adopts
the
test
you
say,
i
think,
that
if
you,
the
person
objecting
has
to
show
that
it
isn't
going
to
lead
to
any
relevant
evidence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
fahringer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
would
an
affidavit
by
the
defendant
be
that
sort
of
a
reasonable
showing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
lawyer
on
hearsay
presumably?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fahringer,
wasn't
it
shown
in
this
case
that
these
companies
that
were
being
subpoenaed
were
in
fact
alter
egos
of
one
principal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
well,
okay--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--why
shouldn't
the
grand
jury
be
entitled
to
inquire
on
that
basis
alone?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
or
the
third
circuit
in
some
other
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
may
not
be
any
logical
inference
of
the
sort
that
would
convince
a
jury
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
surely
the
government
need
not
show
that
much
when
they
are
just
investigating.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
enough?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
this
was
looking
towards
a
prosecution
for
obscenity,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
agree
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fahringer,
why
don't
you
slow
down
and
calm
down.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
then
that
the
government
has
to
take
the
word
of
a
potential
defendant
as
to
something
unless
they
have
some
sort
of
independent
evidence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
the
chief
justice,
not
judge.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
let's
follow
justice
stevens'
hypothesis,
or
the
hypothesis
which
he
mentioned.
suppose
the
government
says
here
we
know
from
the
admission
that
the,
mr.
rothstein
owns
all
three
of
these
companies.
we
think
it's
possible
that
the
mfr
bookstore
in
brooklyn
might
have
been
operated
the
same
way
as
these
others.
we
want
to
take
a
look
at
their
sales
records
and
see.
and
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says
mfr
has
never
sold
any
books
in
virginia.
now
does
the
government
win
or
lose
at
that
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
is
that
different
from
what
happened
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
on
these
same
facts
if
the
government
had
just
said
different
words
the
outcome
would
have
been
different?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
what
more
do
they
have...
is
it
enough
to
just
say
we
have
a
hunch...
supposing
they
say
we
have
a
hunch?
we
can't
prove
it
in
any
way,
we
just
have
a
hunch.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
they
have
to
have
outside
evidence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
which
would...
the
good
faith
basis
would
have
to
have
outside
evidence,
i
take
it,
from
your
answers
to
the
questions.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
but
you're
talking
about
outside
evidence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fahringer.
mr.
bryson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
