justice
scalia
well
actually,
mr.
bryson,
you
really
don't
go
that
far
as
to
say
that
the
court
has
a
responsibility
to
assure
that
the
grand
jury
is
proceeding
in
good
faith.
you
would
put
the
burden--
justice
scalia
--so
it
isn't
really
that
the
court
has
a
responsibility
to
assure
it.
justice
scalia
you
would
say
that
if
the
claimant
can
show
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
proceeding
in
bad,
in
good
faith--
justice
scalia
--but
that
showing
cannot
consist
of
the,
just
utter
irrelevance
to
the
investigation
of
what
is
sought.
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
i
thought
the
fourth
amendment
protected
us
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
not
bad
faith
searches
and
seizures.
you're
telling
us
that
even
though
what
the
grand
jury
asks
for
is
really
not
related
enough
that
any
reasonable
investigator
would
ask
for
it,
nonetheless,
so
long
as
this
grand
jury
is
invincibly
stupid
so
that
it
is
not
acting
in
bad
faith,
it
is
all
right.
justice
scalia
no,
but
good
faith
is
different
from
reasonable.
i
mean,
if
good
faith
only
means
reasonable...
if
good
faith
means
reasonable,
we
have
no
problem.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--well,
you
don't
mean
good
faith
then.
you
mean
something
quite
different
from
good
faith.
i
thought
you
meant
by
good
faith
that
it
was
the
burden
of
the
person
from
whom
the
information
is
sought
to
show
that
the
grand
jury
positively
was
not
proceeding
in
order
to
further
the
investigation,
however
mistakenly,
but
rather
had
some
other
motivation,
to
harass,
to
get
publicity,
or
whatever.
you
are
not
saying
that
now?
justice
scalia
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
reasonableness.
i
can
be
really
stupid
and
make
a,
in
the
best
of
good
faith,
a
really
unreasonable
request
for
information.
justice
scalia
why
can't...
i
am
impressed
with
the
fact
that
we
shouldn't
have
to,
that
it
will
hamstring
investigations
if
you
allow
these
things
to
be
litigated
up
front
all
the
time,
i
understand
that.
but
why
can't
one
have
a
different
rule
for
whether
if
the
individual
refuses
to
comply
with
the
request
and
adamantly
refuses
and
is
subjected
to
criminal
penalties
for
that.
the
validity
of
his
refusal
is
then
tested
on
the
ground
of
simply
good
faith.
justice
scalia
well
no,
it's
usually
a
motion
to
quash,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i'm
talking
about
we
will
not
allow
any
motions
to
quash.
you
take
your
chances.
if
you
want
to
stand
there
and
refuse
to
comply
and
get
hit
with
contempt
and
a
jail
term,
we'll
litigate
it.
and
if
you're
right
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
subpoena,
you'll
win.
and
if
you're
wrong,
you'll
go
to
jail
for
something
different
from
the
investigation.
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
solution?
justice
scalia
and
use
bad
faith
for
that,
that
is
fine.
but
the
constitution
does
say
that
i
shouldn't
have
to
comply,
it
seems
to
me,
with
an
unreasonable
request
for
any
of
my
information.
justice
scalia
are
all
of
these
cases,
did
they
come
up
on
motions
to
quash,
or
did
they
come
up--
justice
scalia
--motions
to
enforce.
justice
scalia
oh,
seeking
to
enforce
them
in
the
courts.
justice
scalia
but
it's
still...
i
see.
