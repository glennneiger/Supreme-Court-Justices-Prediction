justice
stevens
may
i
just
say,
there
are
several
opinions
in
the
case.
which
one
are
you
reading
from?
justice
stevens
which
is
where
in
the
materials?
justice
stevens
and
where
is
it
in
the
materials?
justice
stevens
okay.
thank
you.
justice
stevens
what
case
was
that
from?
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
read
that
literally
you
can
subpoena
anything
without
any
limit,
right?
justice
stevens
but
under
blair
there
wouldn't
be
any
limit
at
all.
justice
stevens
so
you
don't
rely
on
blair
literally,
then?
justice
stevens
i
just
suggest
that
blair,
like
this
case,
perhaps
involves
some
overriding...
you
know,
written
a
little
beyond
the
facts.
justice
stevens
mr.
bryson,
do
you
think
the
judge
should
look
at
each
subpoena
all
by
itself
in
a
vacuum,
or
is
it
proper
for
the
judge
to
consider
the
pattern
of
subpoenas
of
which
this
is
just
one?
justice
stevens
is
it
at
all
relevant
that
the
other
subpoenas
raised
first
amendment
issues
that
may
well
have
influenced
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
earlier
decisions?
justice
stevens
what
exactly
were
the
records
that
were
requested
here?
justice
stevens
that
would
identify
the
customers
and
the
suppliers
of
the
company.
justice
stevens
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that,
is
there?
justice
stevens
they
filed
uncontradicted
affidavits
to
that
effect,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
so
in
terms
of
the
rule,
you
say
that
the
word
unreasonable
has
one
meaning
with
reference
to
trial
and
another
with
reference
to
grand
jury?
justice
stevens
well,
doesn't
the
prior
history
of
the
quashing
of
a
whole
series
of
subpoenas
demonstrate
on
its
face
that
the
grand
jury
was
abusing
its
powers
in
this
particular
investigation?
justice
stevens
all
of
which,
as
i
understand,
the
government
agrees
now
they
were
properly
quashed,
the
prior
subpoenas.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
could
i
ask
you
just
one
question,
mr.
bryson,
because
i
kind
of
got
lost.
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
a
different
rule
for
grand
jury
subpoenas
than
for
trial
subpoenas,
and--
justice
stevens
--i
can
understand
the
reasoning.
have
we
held
that?
justice
stevens
the
bowman
case
came
up
in
kind
of
a
funny
way,
i
know.
justice
stevens
the
defendant
subpoenaed
the
government's
materials.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
where
are
the
affidavits
in
the
record?
are
they
in
the
printed
materials?
justice
stevens
in
the
appendix.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
as
i
recall
their
briefs,
they
say
they
did
represent
to
the,
and
the
district
court
was
apparently
persuaded,
that
there
might
be
enough
similarity
between
the
operations
of
these
two
companies
in
new
york
and
what
goes
on
in
virginia
to
show
some
kind
of
a
pattern
or
intent
by
engaging
in
similar
acts
or
possibly
conspiracies.
it
is
sort
of
speculative,
but
they
did,
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
in
their
briefs
they
say
they
made
some
kind
of
a
showing
to
the
district
court,
and
he
allowed
the
discovery.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
catch
this.
you're
saying
that
they
might...
this
is
a
different
point
than
you
made
in
your
brief,
at
least
i
think,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
he
might
have
shown
that
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
of
obscene
materials
in
virginia
were
used,
were
siphoned
off
into
the...
why
couldn't
you
find
that
by
looking
at
the
virginia
records?
justice
stevens
those
proceeds
would
only
be
relevant
if
they
were
sales
of
obscene
materials.
justice
stevens
i
thought
all
the
subpoenas
for
the
particular
tapes
had
been
quashed.
justice
stevens
under
that
theory
you
could
of
course
get
all
the
records
of
all
the
companies
that
this
man
had
any
investment
in.
justice
stevens
which
would
be
established
by
the
sale
of
one
obscene
book,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
two
books,
that's
right.
