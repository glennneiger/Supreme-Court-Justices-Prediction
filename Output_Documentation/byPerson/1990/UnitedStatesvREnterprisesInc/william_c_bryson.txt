mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
grand
jury
must
make
a
showing
of
relevance
before
obtaining
enforcement
of
a
subpoena
for
ordinary
corporate
business
records.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
a
grand
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
served
the
subpoena
on
three
companies,
two
of
which
are
respondents
in
this
case.
the
three
companies
were
related
companies,
all
were
owned
by
the
same
man
in
new
york,
all
had
the
same
address,
and
all
were
in
the
same
line
of
business.
the
subpoena,
the
two
subpoenas
that
are
at
issue
here
called
for
business
records
of
a
variety
of
sorts
from
the
two
respondent
companies.
the
district
court
had
hearings,
and
with
respect
to
each
of
the
subpoenas,
and
ruled
that
there
was
no
requirement
of
any
preliminary
showing
of
relevance.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
there
were,
that
the
government
had
adequately
satisfied
the
court
that
the
materials
sought
were
relevant,
based
on
the
fact
that
the
first
company,
a
company
named
model,
which
is
not
a
respondent
in
this
case,
that
the
model
company
had
distributed
obscene
materials
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
and
the
other
two
companies,
which
were
owned
by
the
same
person
and
occupied
the
same
premises,
although
they
were
not
shown
to
have
distributed
materials
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
nonetheless
they
were
sufficiently
related
to
the
company
that
had,
that
the
government
was
entitled
through
the
grand
jury
to
inquire
as
to
what
activities
those
companies
had
been
engaged
in,
and
what
the
relationship
was
between
those
companies
and
model,
which
had
been
involved
in
the
eastern
district
distributions.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
held
that
it
was
necessary
under
rule
17(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
government
to
demonstrate
both
relevance
of
the
materials
and
their
admissibility
at
any
potential
trial
before
the
subpoena
could
be
enforced.
now
we
submit
that
this
decision
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
in
order
to
demonstrate,
i
think,
just
how
inconsistent
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
is,
i
would
like
to...
to
read
very
briefly
a
passage
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
contrast
it
with
passages
from
opinions
of
this
court,
because
i
think
the
contrast
is
quite
sharp.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
i
will
try
to
keep
it
brief,
"the
grand
jury's
request
for
these
records--
"
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--this
is...
i
am
reading
from
the
most
recent
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
one
which
is
at
issue
on
which
cert
was
granted
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it's
the
beginning
of
the
petition
appendix.
i
believe
it
starts
at
pet.
app.
1.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
i
am
reading
from
the
section
of
the
opinion
that
starts
at
pet.
app.
7
and
runs
through
pet.
app.
10.
but
i
will
just
read
two
sentences
which
i
think
summarize
the
holding
of
the
court,
and
summarize
what
we
feel
is
the
clear
error
committed
by
the
court
of
appeals
here.
"the
grand
jury's
request
appears
to
be
premised
on
nothing
more
than
a
mere
hope
that
the
documents
will
reveal
a
tie
between
the
companies
in
virginia.
"
mere
hope,
however,
does
not
justify
the
enforcement
of
a
subpoena
under
rule
17(c).
and
here
is
the
holding
of
the
court,
"the
government
must
offer
some
evidence
of
a
connection
between
mfr
and
r.
enterprises.
"
those
are
the
two
respondent
companies,
"and
virginia
before
it
can
subpoena
the
companies'
business
records
under
rule
17(c).
"
now
contrast
that
holding,
if
you
will,
with
the
language
that
this
court
employed,
and
has
repeated,
i
might
say,
in
later
cases,
but
as
early
as
the
blair
case,
in
which
the
court
said
a
witness
is
not
entitled
to
urge
objections
of
incompetency
or
irrelevancy
such
as
a
party
might
raise,
for
this
is
no
concern
of
his.
he
is
not
entitled
to
set
limits
to
the
investigation
that
the
grand
jury
may
conduct.
and
again
in
the
morton
salt
case--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
blair
against
the
united
states,
1919
decision,
your
honor.
but
again,
that
language
has
shown
up
again
and
again
in
this
court's
decisions.
the
morton
salt
case
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
there
is
a
limit,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
blair
is
talking
about
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
question
that
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
don't
say
that
there
are
no
limits,
because
we
believe
that
a
court
has
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
grand
jury
is
proceeding
in
good
faith
and
is
not
engaged
in
something
that
is
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
court
could
have
said
assuming
that
the
grand
jury
is
proceeding
in
good
faith,
and
i
think
that
was
the
assumption
underlying
the
court's
discussion
on
that
point.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
court
has--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
the
claimant
can
make
a
prima
facie
showing,
then
it
puts
the
court
in
a
position
that
the
court
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--unless
the
showing
establishes
that
there
is
just
no
conceivable
relevance,
that
the
materials
are
so
clearly
on
their
face
irrelevant,
anything
that
the
grand
jury
could
legitimately
be
interested
in,
that
it
establishes
virtually
a
prima
facie
case
in
and
of
itself
that
the
grand
jury
is
engaged
in
some
kind
of
improper
action
beyond
the
scope
of
its
responsibilities
and
authorities.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
the
burden
of
proof
shifts.
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
situation
in
which,
if,
for
example,
the
district
court
is
satisfied
that
there
is
no...
the
district
court
believes,
in
looking
at
the
claim
that
is
made,
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
imagine
how
this
material
could
conceivably
be
relevant
to
the
grand
jury's
inquiry,
then
the
burden
in
a
practical
sense
of
going
forward
shifts
to
the
government,
because
the
court
is
prepared
to
say,
government,
show
my
why
the
recipient
of
the
subpoena
doesn't
have
a
fair
point
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
now
i
have
to
emphasize
that.
i
don't
think
there
are
very
many
cases
that
are
going
to
arise
with
this
scenario,
because
the
grand
jury's
authority
to
investigate
is
extremely
broad
and
there
will
be,
it
will
be
a
rare
case
indeed
in
which
a
recipient
of
a
subpoena
can
make
the
kind
of
preliminary
showing
of
lack
of
conceivable
relevance.
but
assuming
that
one
were
made,
and
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
in
the
past
in
the
history
of
grand
jury
law
that
indicate
such
a
showing
was
made,
then
yes,
i
think
the
court
can
properly
look
to
the
government
to
demonstrate
what
it
is
about
this
request
that
makes
it,
that
brings
it
within
the
sphere
of
the
grand
jury's
responsibilities.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
in
most
cases
that
is
right.
it's
not
true
in
every
case,
because
the
grand
jury
does
on
occasion
exercise
independent
judgment
as
to
what
it
wishes
to
pursue
and
how
it
wishes
to
pursue
it.
but
i
certainly
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
in
most
cases
the
grand
jury
acts
as
the
arm
of
the
prosecutor,
under
the
control
of
the
court.
and
as
this
court
has
explained,
the
court
maintains
responsibility
for
controlling
the
actions
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
consider
the
pattern
of
subpoenas,
any
evidence
that
may
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
the
grand
jury
is
acting
in
good
faith
in
pursuing
an
investigation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think...
first
of
all,
excuse
me...
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
this
issue
on
first
amendment
grounds.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
is
a
consideration
that
the
court,
a
district
court
can
take
into
account.
but
certainly
with
respect
to
these
subpoenas,
which
were
merely
for
business
records,
and
in
which
there
is
no
apparent
first
amendment
interest
to
be
in
effect
whatsoever,
we
submit
that
this
doesn't
present
a
first
amendment
issue,
that
the
proper
course
for
a
district
court
to
take
would
be
to
say
yes,
this
is
the
context
in
which
this
arises.
but
i
find
that
these
are
merely
business
record
subpoenas
and
don't
affect
first
amendment
interests.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
district
court
found
in
this
case.
in
fact,
in
response--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
were
sales
journals...
well,
corporate
journals,
tax
returns--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
customers'
identification
provisions
were
limited
to
those
sales
that
were
made
in
virginia,
which
these
two
respondents
claim
were
none.
so
presumably--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
don't
know.
that
is
what
the
attorneys
for
respondents
have
said.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
right.
and
we
have
no
basis
at
this
point
for
believing
that
they
are
false,
but
we
also,
as
the
district
court
found,
should
be
entitled
to
look
behind
those
affidavits
and
at
least
get
a
representation
from
the
corporation
in
the
form
of
a
custodian
coming
in
and
saying
no,
there
aren't
any
such
materials.
but
in
any
event,
setting
aside
the
question
of
whether
there
were
materials
that
were
distributed
in
virginia
by
these
two
companies,
the
grand
jury
is
entitled
to
know
the
relationship
of
those
companies
with
model
and
any
other
corporate
forms
of
doing
business
of
the
principal
in
this
case,
who
is
mr.
rothstein,
who
is
really
the
person
who
is
under
investigation.
he
obviously
does
business
in
a
corporate
form
through
a
variety
of
corporate
devices,
and
it's...
the
grand
jury's
investigation
would
not
be
complete
unless
it
had
a
good
idea
of
the
relationship
among
those
corporations,
even
if
it
happened
that
one
or
two
of
them
had
not
actually
done
business
in
virginia.
and
that
was
what
the
prosecutor
explained
to
the
district
court
as
the
basis
for
the
subpoenas
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
the
question
then
is...
the
question
arises,
how
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
made
an
error
that
seems
as
fundamental
as
this,
and
we
submit
they
made
just
one
mistake,
but
it
was
sufficient.
and
that
is
the
court
viewed
this
court's
decision
in
the
nixon
case,
which
construed
rule
17,
the
subpoena
rule,
as
it
applied
to
trial
subpoenas,
the
court
of
appeals
construed
that
decision
to
apply
to
grand
jury
subpoenas.
once
you
do
that
a
lot
of
things
happen,
and
the
law
goes
really
awry,
because
the
nixon
case,
and
we
believe
correctly,
applied
rule
17(c)
in
the
context
of
trial
subpoenas
as
a
rule
which
requires
a
showing
of
relevance
and
admissibility,
or
at
least
the
court
devised
principles
of
trial
subpoenas
that
required
admissibility
and
relevance
to
be
shown.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
clear.
the
federal
system
provides
for
limited
pretrial
discovery,
it
is
governed
by
another
rule,
rule
16,
and
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
have
rule
17,
the
subpoena
rule,
simply
serve
as
a
discovery
device.
well,
that
is
fine
in
the
trial
context.
it
won't
work
at
all
in
the
grand
jury
context,
because
the
grand
jury
is
a
discovery
device.
talk
about
how
rule
17
should
not
be
used
for
fishing
expeditions
is
completely
in
apposite
to
grand
juries,
which
are
the
ultimate
fishing
expeditions.
grand
juries,
as
this
court
said
in
morton
salt,
investigate
merely
on
suspicion
that
the
law
is
being
violated,
or
even
just
because
the
grand
jury
wants
assurance
that
it
is
not.
i
mean,
that's
the
ultimate
definition,
i
suppose,
of
a
fishing
expedition,
is
to
go
out
and
find
out
what
is
going
on
in
order
to
obtain
assurance
that
the
law
is
not
being
violated.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
precisely.
the
context
is
everything.
that
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
trial
subpoena
setting
means
that
it
includes
subpoenas
that,
in
which
there
has
not
been
a
showing
of
relevance
or
admissibility
or
specificity.
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
grand
jury
context
is
limited
to
cases
in
which
the
grand
jury
really
is
engaged
in
abuse
of
its
powers.
that
is
the
mistake,
in
a
word,
that
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
made,
and
everything
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
first
of
all
we're
talking
about
there
was
one--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--there
was
one
prior
subpoena,
your
honor,
which
was
involved
in
the
previous
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
several
years
ago,
in
which
we
acknowledged
that
that
subpoena
was
unduly
vague.
we
went
back
and
redrafted
that
subpoena.
that
was
a
subpoena
for
tapes,
not
a
subpoena
for
business
records.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
made
a
mistake
when
it
quashed
that
subpoena
in
the
second
time
around.
we
have
not
pursued
that
issue
in
this
court,
but
we
believe
that
its
decision
on
that
point
was
erroneous.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
however,
the
fact
that
the
grand
jury
made
one
mistake,
as
we
see
it,
with
respect
to
one
subpoena
several
years
ago,
does
not
mean
that
these
subpoenas
are
in
any
way
brought
under
a
cloud.
these
are
very
routine,
run-of-the-mine
business
record
subpoenas
which,
as
the
district
courts
found,
were
perfectly
legitimate
ways
of
trying
to
get
information
that
the
grand
jury
had
every
right
to
obtain.
so
we
see
no
real
relationship
between
the
reversal
of
the
denial
of
motions
to
quash
in
1987,
i
believe
it
was,
versus
what
was
done
in
this
case
with
respect
to
either
the
tape
subpoenas
or
the
business
records
subpoenas.
the
standard,
we
believe,
as
i
have
mentioned,
is
that
there
must
be
shown
to
be
no
conceivable
relevance--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
there
are
cases
in
which
it
may
be
possible
to
make
such
a
showing.
certainly
the
party
can
come
forward
and
say,
we
certainly
can't
imagine
how
this
could
conceivably
be
relevant
to
any
criminal
activity,
and
could
show
that,
for
example,
the
activity
sought
occurred
long
before
the
statute
of
limitations
period
that
is
in
question,
or
that
there
was
absolutely
no
relationship
between
the
district
and
the
company
that
is
involved.
for
example,
suppose
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
company
in
albany,
new
york
which
had
no
relationship
to
mr.
rothstein,
model,
or
anybody
else.
that
company
could
come
forward
and
say,
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
our
materials
for.
now,
the
district
court
might,
in
that
setting,
very
well
say
all
right,
i
will
hear
in
camera,
for
example,
from
the
government,
just
to
satisfy
myself
that
there
is
some
relationship,
because
frankly
it
looks
fishy
to
me,
and
i
can't
see
what
in
the
world
the
government
might
have
that
is
of
interest
here.
that
is
something
that
can
be
done
quickly,
can
be
done
very
easily,
and
if
it
is
done
in
camera
can
be
done
without
compromising
the
grand
jury's
secrecy
concerns.
however,
we
don't
submit
that
this
is
something
that
ought
to
be
litigated
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
where
it
can
be
handled
very
quickly
before
the
district
court,
either
in
an
in
camera
proceeding
or
simply
in
an
informal
motion
to
quash,
exactly
as
was
done
in
this
case.
now
i
think,
if
you
will
look
at
the
proceedings
in
this
case,
frankly
i
think
they
were
a
model
of
the
degree
of
inquiry
that
is
appropriate
for
a
district
court
to
employ
where
the
subpoenas
are
perhaps
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary,
in
this
case
subpoenas
that
were
sent
to
a
company
that
is
outside
of
the
district.
the
grand
jury
in
each
case
had,
we
think,
good
reasons
which
the
prosecutor
demonstrated,
for
seeking
these
materials.
and
upon
the
prosecutor's
demonstrating
those
reasons,
the
district
courts...
and
there
were
three
different
judges
who
looked
at
this...
each
time
were
satisfied
that
yes,
you
have
shown
me
enough
to
persuade
me
that
there
is,
that
these
materials
are
relevant.
even
though
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
relevance,
i
am
certainly
not
going
to
quash
these
materials
on
grounds
of
relevance.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
perfectly
suitable
way
for
a
district
court
to
proceed,
and
it
does
not
either
reveal
to
an
untoward
extent
what
the
grand
jury
is
doing,
nor
does
it
impede
the
progress
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation
in
a
way
that
this
court
in
dionisio
and
subsequent
cases
has
indicated
should
not
be
allowed
to
happen.
these
things
do
take
time,
and
they,
at
proceedings
all
the
way
through
the
court
of
appeals
on
nice
questions
of
relevance
end
up
depriving
the
grand
jury
of
materials
for
long
periods
of
time
while
the
statute
of
limitations
runs.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
of
reasonableness
depends
on
the
setting.
and
in
this
setting
i
think
reasonableness
allows
the
grand
jury
to
inquire
throughout
the
area
of
bona
fide
good
faith
criminal
investigation,
that
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
in
this
context
reasonable
is
essentially
the
same
as
good
faith.
if
the
grand
jury
is
misguided
and
is
pursuing--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
i
am
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
i
think
in
this
context...
it
may
be
that
your
request
for
information
was
misguided,
but
because
the
grand
jury
has
the,
is
an
independent
constitutional
body
which
is
entitled
to
pursue
criminal
investigations
wherever
they
may
lead
it,
the
judgment
of
a
court
that
this
is
an
unwise
line
of
inquiry,
or
a
line
of
inquiry
that
is
not
apt
to
be
fruitful,
is
not
enough
to
deprive
the
grand
jury
of
the
right
to
pursue,
albeit
fruitlessly,
an
investigation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
is
how
these
cases
are
all
litigated,
at
the
point
at
which
the
individual
adamantly
refuses.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
but
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
would
be
completely
inconsistent
with
the
way
things
have
always
been
done,
which
is...
the
fact
that
it
would
be
a
different
way
of
doing
things
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
wrong,
but
the
way
we
do
it
now
is
to
have
a
motion
to
quash,
which
is
where
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
is
decided,
then--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--again,
our
submission
is
that
the
definition
in
this
context
of
unreasonable
is
not
something
that
a
judge
thinks
is
not
a
fruitful
line,
or
not
likely
to
be
a
fruitful
line
of
inquiry,
but
rather
something
in
which
the
grand
jury
is
clearly
out
of
its
bailiwick.
the
grand
jury
has
virtual
unimpeded
independence
within
the
sphere
of
conducting
good
faith
criminal
investigations.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
that
is
essentially
the
rule
both
in
that
case,
in
endicott
johnson,
which
is
another
administrative
subpoena
case,
and
in
morton
salt.
one
could
have
done
it
differently,
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
came
up
because
they
were--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--administrative
subpoena
cases.
they
came
up
on
motions
to
enforce.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
right.
but
that's
not
the
way
grand
juries--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--grand
juries...
subpoenas
are
self-enforcing.
you
don't
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
until
you
get
to
the
point
of
contempt.
that's
the
only
way
you
can
take
an
appeal
to
pursue
it.
whereas
in
the
administrative
subpoena
area,
of
course,
you--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
have,
i
think
the
district
courts
often
are
quite
sensitive
and
aware
of
what
is
going
on--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
exactly
right.
i
think
that
is
our
position,
that
the
judge
can
say
i
certainly
wouldn't
pursue
it,
i
think
you
are
barking
up
a
tree
that
has
nothing
on
it,
but
i
can't
tell
you
that
you're
not
free
to
do
so.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has,
since
the
boyd
case
and
in
subsequent
cases
including
the
walling
case,
has
regarded
them
as
applicable.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
theoretical
question
as
to
whether
they
ought
to
be.
certainly
with
respect
to
oppressiveness
of
the
subpoena
this
court
has
said,
and
said
in
the
walling
case,
for
example,
that
if
you
have
a
request
for
a
huge
number
of
documents,
that
creates
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
but
i
think
that
the
court,
frankly,
took
a
wrong
turn
in
boyd
on
this
in
regarding
the
fourth
amendment
as
applicable
at
all
to
subpoenas.
and
one,
if
one
started
afresh
and
examined
this
question,
one
could
well
conclude
that
this
is
really
a
due
process
problem,
not
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
but
i
do
concede
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
applicable.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
you
have
not
to
my
knowledge
had
a
case
in
which
that
question
in
that
form
was
presented,
so
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
was
a
trial
subpoena.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
that
was
a
trial
subpoena.
of
course,
when
i
say
you
haven't
held
that,
you
have
held
again
and
again
and
again
that
standards
different
from
the
ones
that
were
applied
in
nixon
are
applicable
to
grand
jury
subpoenas,
but
you
have
never
sat
down
and
said
rule
17
doesn't
apply
in
the
same
way
to
trial
subpoenas
and
grand
jury
subpoenas.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
just
very
briefly,
your
honor.
the
respondents
quoted
from
a
section
of
the
transcript,
and
this
is
at
page
645
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
noted
that
the
court
had
asked
the
prosecutor
what
you
would
expect
to
find
in
mfr's
business
records,
as
to
which
the
prosecutor
responded,
"i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
"
that
is
where
respondents
stop,
both
here
and
in
their
brief.
but
the
prosecutor
went
on,
and
he
said
"i
assume
we'll
find
that
mr.
rothstein's
statement
is
accurate,
that
he
is
the
owner
of
all
three,
that
he
controls
all
three,
that
the
assets
of
all
three
are
intermingled.
"
and
the
court
then
asks,
"would
this
be
pertinent
to
the
investigation?
"
and
the
prosecutor
says
"absolutely".
and
the
court
asks
"how"?
and
the
prosecutor
gives
this
explanation.
if
the
grand
jury
were
looking
at
the
possible
application,
for
example,
of
the
rico
statute,
and
model
were
found
to
have
shipped
obscene
material
into
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
a
jury
could
find,
if
we
had
the
records
to
support
this,
that
the
assets
of
model
which
were
generated
by
the
sale
of
obscene
material
were
used
to
fund
or
support
the
business,
the
ongoing
business
of
mfr
books.
this
is
one
of
several
theories
that
the
prosecutor
laid
out
for
the
district
court.
this
isn't
just
an
i
don't
know,
we're
just
on
a
wild
goose
chase
type
of
answer.
he
had
an
explanation
and
he
gave
it.
the
prosecutor
also
was
responding,
responded
to
the
point
that
was
raised
in
the
district
court
and
has
been
raised
here,
that
the
companies
really
are
not
shown
to
have
been
engaged
in
the
same
business--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
you
wouldn't
know
what
happened
to
the
new
york
assets
that...
mfr
is
based,
excuse
me,
model
is
based
in
new
york.
you
don't
know
what
model
did
with
the
proceeds
of
its
sales
in
virginia.
what
it
may
have
been
doing
is
using
those
proceeds--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
but
we
do
know
that
model
did
sell
obscene
materials
in
virginia,
so
we
have
that
predicate.
that
is
clear--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
in
another
prosecution
that
was
brought
previously,
model's
tapes
were
adjudicated
to
be
obscene.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
see.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
so
we
know
that
they
have
in
the
past
distributed
materials
in
virginia.
i
would
add
this
wasn't
the
only
theory
of
relevance.
there
were
several
theories
of
relevance,
and
we
have
discussed
them
in
our
brief.
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
that
is
right,
we
could.
and
i
think
that
would
be
entirely
reasonable
if
there
is
a
good
faith
basis
for
believing
there
may
have
been
a
racketeering
violation
here.
now
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
would
have
to
be
multiple
sales,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right.
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
i
mean,
the
rico
statute
would
have
to
be
established,
that
is
right.
in
addition
i
would
point
out
in
response
to
the
point
that
there
was
no
showing
that
there
was
a
relationship
between
these
companies,
the
president
himself
when
he
was
served
with
the
subpoena,
and
this
is
in
an
affidavit
that
appears
at
page
401
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals,
said
with
respect
to
the
three
companies,
it's
all
the
same.
i
am
the
president
of
all
three.
i
mean
he,
it
is
clear
that
this
is
really
just
a
set
of
companies
that
are
alter
egos
of
this
man
and
engaged
in
the
same
business.
the
grand
jury,
we
submit,
was
entirely
suited,
entirely
entitled
to
get
those
materials.
thank
you.
