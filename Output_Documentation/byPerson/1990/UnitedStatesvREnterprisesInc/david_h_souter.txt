justice
souter
well,
if
that
has
been
done,
do
you
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
shifts,
or
that
simply
the
burden
of
going
forward
then
devolves
on
the
government?
justice
souter
right.
if
you
can't
rebut
the
claim,
you
are
going
to
lose.
justice
souter
well,
doesn't
that
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
the,
whether
there
has
got
to
be
a
demonstration
that
the
evidence
would
be
admissible?
justice
souter
do
you
concede
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
wrong
in
imposing
that
condition?
