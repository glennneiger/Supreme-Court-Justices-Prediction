justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
case
89-1436
is
united
states
against
r.
enterprises,
inc.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
early
1988,
a
federal
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
issued
a
series
of
subpoenas
to
respondents,
r.
enterprises,
inc.
and
mfr
court
street
books,
seeking
a
variety
of
corporate
books
and
records
in
connection
with
an
investigation
of
interstate
transportation
of
obscene
materials.
the
respondents
moved
to
quash
the
subpoenas
arguing
that
they
called
for
their
production
of
materials
irrelevant
to
the
grand
jury’s
investigation,
and
that
enforcement
of
the
subpoenas
would
likely
infringe
first
amendment
rights.
the
district
court
denied
the
respondents’
motion
to
quash,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
government
must
show
relevancy,
admissibility
at
trial,
and
specificity
in
order
to
enforce
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
that
court
concluded
that
the
subpoena’s
issued
here
failed
to
meet
a
requirement
that
any
documents
subpoenaed
must
be
admissible
as
evidence
at
trial.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
an
improper
standard
under
rule
17(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or
evaluating
the
grand
jury
subpoenas
issued
to
the
respondents.
since
the
grand
jury
subpoena
is
presumed
to
be
reasonable,
the
burden
of
showing
otherwise
is
on
the
recipient
seeking
to
avoid
compliance.
whereas
here,
the
grand
jury
subpoena
is
challenged
on
relevancy
grounds,
the
motion
to
quash
must
be
denied
unless
the
district
court
determines
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
category
of
materials
the
government
seeks
will
produce
information
relevant
to
the
general
subject
of
the
grand
jury’s
investigation.
the
district
court
properly
concluded
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
respondents’
business
records
would
produce
information
relevant
to
the
grand
jury’s
investigation
and
to
the
interstate
transportation
of
obscene
materials.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
joined
in
all
but
part
3(b)
of
the
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
