justice
white
do
you
say
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held?
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
you
really
were,
in
your
brief
that
you
were
really
defending
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
you
may
be
defending
what
it
did.
justice
white
were
you,
at
least
you
say
if
you
come
in
and
object
to
the
subpoena
you
have
got
to
do
something
more
than
just
object.
justice
white
you
have
to
prove
what?
what
do
you
have
to
prove,
or
what
do
you
have
to
convince
the
judge
of?
justice
white
you
don't
need
to
argue
the
facts
now.
what
burden
do
you
have?
justice
white
reasonable
showing
absolutely--
justice
white
and
therefore
failed
to
meet
the
requirement
that
any
documents
subpoenaed
must
be
admissible?
justice
white
well
that's
what
it
says.
justice
white
well,
was
the
grand
jury
bound
to
believe
the
submission
that
this,
that
there
was
no
business
done
in
virginia
by
these
two
other
companies?
justice
white
maybe
that's
what
they
wanted
to
find
out.
justice
white
do
you
think
it
would
be
enough
to
say
well,
we
want
to
find
out
whether
they
do
or
not?
justice
white
do
they
or
not?
would
that
be
enough?
justice
white
why
not?
