truthfully,
we're
not
talking
about
the
grand
jury.
we're
talking
about
the
prosecuting
attorney,
aren't
we?
justice
marshall
of
course,
quite
a
few
of
the
judges
were
formal
prosecutors.
justice
marshall
so
they
know
what
is
being
done
and
they
know
what's--
justice
marshall
--if
i
understand,
your
position
is
the
judge
is
perfectly
well
to
say
i
don't
think
this
leads
anyplace,
but
if
you
want
to

justice

what
you
want
is
a

justice
marshall
what
you

is
a

isn't
that
what
you
want?
justice
marshall
well,
what,
what
do
you
want?
what
more
do
you
want?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
what
i'm

what

grand
jury
proceedings
were
secret--
justice
marshall
--and
that
you
didn't
have
to
give
all
the
records
of
the
grand
jury
out
in
the
open
courtroom.
justice
marshall
isn't
that
what
you're
asking?
justice
marshall
aren't
you
asking
for
the
government's
case,
or
a
little
peep
at
it?
justice
marshall
thank
you.
