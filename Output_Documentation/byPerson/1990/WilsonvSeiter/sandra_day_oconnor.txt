justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
alexander,
in,
certainly
in
estelle
against
gamble,
where
there
was
a
claim
based
on
failure
to
render
medical
care
to
prisoners,
the
court
followed,
as
i
understand
it,
a
deliberate
indifference
standard.
justice
o'connor
a
state
of
mind
component.
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
would
apply
to
a
long-term
neglect
of
medical
care
needs
as
well?
justice
o'connor
would
it
reach
the
same
result?
justice
o'connor
what
if
it's
lack
of
medical
care?
do
you
think
the
estelle
test
is
applicable?
justice
o'connor
deliberate
indifference.
justice
o'connor
and
why
not
other
prison
conditions,
then?
lack
of
food.
why
wouldn't
you
apply
the
same
standard?
justice
o'connor
well,
they
play
a
role
in
medical
care
too.
i
don't
see
how
you
distinguish.
justice
o'connor
but
they
might
involve
all
those
things,
actually.
justice
o'connor
if
the
food
were
insufficient
or
the
circumstances
of
incarceration
were
such
that
they
were
subjected
to
abuse
and
injury
from
other
prisoners.
i
mean,
there
could
be
a
wide
variety
of
things
that
would
cause
severe
medical
results
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
and
why
wouldn't
you
apply
the
same
test?
justice
o'connor
in
the
context
of
a
prison
riot,
of
course.
justice
o'connor
and
i
thought
the
opinion
was
careful
to
say
that
it
might
be
some
different
mental
component
in
other
contexts.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
it
referred
specifically
to
estelle
against
gamble,
for
example.
