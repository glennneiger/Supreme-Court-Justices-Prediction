but
you
would
leave
the
estelle
test
intact
for
medical--
justice
white
--and
you
would
leave
whitley
in
place--
justice
white
--where
there
is
prison
security
involved?
justice
white
what
test
do
you
think
rhodes
against
chapman
used?
that
was
a
prison
conditions
case.
justice
white
i
know
that.
what
test...
did
it
have
a
standard?
did
it...
do
you
think
they...
that
that
case
included
a
mental
element
in
deciding
the
eighth
amendment
issue?
justice
white
and
you
think
rhodes
against
chapman
has
not
been
overruled
or
confined
to
its
facts,
or
anything
of
the
kind,
by
later
cases?
justice
white
i
thought
that
state
of
mind
issues
were
almost
inappropriate
for
summary
judgment.
justice
white
that's
true
of
any
issue,
of
any...
but
if
you
put
state
of
mind,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
certainly
inviting
waiting
for
a
jury
trial
to
decide
all
this.
justice
white
you
say
that
you
have
a
three-step
inquiry?
justice
white
and
any
one
of
them
that
is
missing
is
fatal
to
the
case?
justice
white
including
deprivation
of
basic
conditions
of
life?
justice
white
as
against
the
professional
only.
