justice
scalia
why
is
it
part
of
the
punishment
after
3
years
and
not
after,
you
know...
i
just
don't
understand
that
at
all.
i
also
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that...
i
mean,
we
have
said
explicitly
in
whitley
that
it
is
obduracy
and
wantonness,
not
inadvertence
of...
or
error
in
good
faith,
that
characterizes
the
conduct
prohibited
by
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
whether
that
conduct
occurs
in
connection
with
establishing
conditions
of
confinement,
supplying
medical
needs,
or
restoring
official
control.
i
mean,
that...
that's
obviously
a
frame
of
mind
test,
not
a--
justice
scalia
--yes.
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
scalia
well,
what
about
the
phrase,
not
only
it
is
obduracy
and
wantonness,
but
it
goes
on
to
say
not
inadvertence
or
error
in
good
faith.
that's
what
we
said
in
whitley:
not
inadvertence
or
error
in
good
faith.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
you
can
say
that
it
reconciles
them
by
the
simple
fact
that
when
it
goes
on
for
a
long
time
you
can
more
easily
find
the
absence
of
inadvertence
or
error
in
good
faith.
that's
the
reason
it
reconciles
them.
because
when
it
lasts
for
3
years
it's
impossible
to
believe
that
somebody
didn't
know
about
them.
so
it
does
show
the
obduracy.
it
does
show
the
mental
state.
i
don't
know
any
other
basis
for
just
picking
out
of
the
air
a
long-term/short-term
distinction.
where
do
you
get
it
from?
justice
scalia
well,
blue-eyed
defendants
might
do
it,
too,
but
what's
the
reason
for
long
term-short
term?
i
have
given
you
a
reason
that
reconciles
long
term
and
short
term.
it's
the
same
one
that
justice
kennedy
suggested.
long
term
shows
a
different
state
of
mind
than
short
term
does.
justice
scalia
ms.
alexander,
you've
confused
me
now.
i
thought
you
were
drawing
the
distinction
between
long
term
and
short
term,
but
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
o'connor
it
has
changed
to
systemic
versus
nonsystemic.
it
can
be
long
term
but
nonsystemic,
it
seems
to
me,
that
is
if
one
particular
prisoner
were
denied
medical
treatment
over
the
long
term.
where
does
that
come
within
your
theology
here?
is
that
a
long
term
or
is
it
a
nonsystemic?
what...
how
does
it
work?
justice
scalia
even
to
one
prisoner?
justice
scalia
not
even
negligence?
you
consider
negligence
to
be
a
state
of
mind,
too,
right?
it
doesn't
even
require
negligence?
justice
scalia
what
if
you
have
a
hurricane
and
all
the
lights
go
out
in
the
prison
and
there
is
just
no
air
conditioning.
it's
just
terrible
for
2
days,
and
help
can't
get
through.
is
that--
justice
scalia
--more
specifically,
it's
not
a
product
of
anybody's
negligence
or
deliberateness.
justice
scalia
maybe
what
justice
stevens'
question
suggests
is
that
you're
wrong
to
establish,
as
you
did
earlier,
three
separate
criteria.
that
maybe
there
is
one
that
always
has
to
exist,
and
that
is
the
deprivation
of
some
basic
necessity
of
life,
including
life
itself,
and
either
of
the
other
two,
either
the
intent
to
punish,
which
would
explain
the
capital
punishment
cases,
because
you
are
taking
away
the
person's
life
intentionally
in
order
to
punish
the
person,
not
malicious
or
anything,
but
in
order--
justice
scalia
--so
why
don't
you
do
it
that
way?
there
must
either
be
an
intent
to
punish
or,
as
you
say,
if
not
an
intent
to
punish,
it...
that's
not
the
purpose
of
it
but
nonetheless
it
is
done
with
the
requisite
state
of
mind,
ranging
from
indifference
up
to
wantonness.
i
don't
know
how
you
want
to
describe
it.
would
that
explain
the
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
pearly
wilson,
is
a
prison
inmate
in
ohio.
he
sued
the
respondents,
who
are
prison
officials,
alleging
that
certain
conditions
of
his
confinement
constituted
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
violation
of
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
prison
officials.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed,
concluding
that
wilson's
affidavits
failed
to
establish
the
requisite
culpable
state
of
mind
on
the
part
of
the
officials.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
the
sixth
circuit
that
an
inmate
claiming
that
prison
conditions
violate
the
eighth
amendment
must
show
a
culpable
state
of
mind
on
the
part
of
the
officials.
this
requirement
is
implicit
in
that
amendment's
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
sixth
circuit,
however,
appears
to
have
applied
an
overly
exacting
intense
standard,
stating
that
the
official's
conduct
must
be
marked
by
"persistent
malicious
cruelty."
the
appropriate
standard
is
the
one
we
have
long
applied
to
prisoner
claims
involving
medical
care,
namely
deliberate
indifference.
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
reconsideration
under
that
standard.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
marshall,
blackmun,
and
stevens
have
joined.
