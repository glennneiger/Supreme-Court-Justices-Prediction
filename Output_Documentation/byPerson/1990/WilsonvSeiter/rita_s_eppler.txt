ms.
rita
s.
eppler
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
whitley
v.
albers
this
court
determined
that
it
is
wantonness
and
obduracy
that
characterize
conduct
prohibited
by
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
whether
that
conduct
occurs
in
connection
with
conditions
of
confinement,
supplying
medical
needs,
or
in
quelling
a
prison
uprising.
a
necessary
balance
between
the
competing
societal
interest
of
humane
treatment
of
inmates
and
the
security
and
financial
concerns
of
operating
our
nation's
prisons
requires
a
standard
that
affords
proper
deference
to
prison
officials'
decision
making.
this
balance
would
be
achieved
in
a
conditions
of
confinement
case
by
defining
wantonness
and
obduracy
as
requiring
malice.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
no,
your
honor,
it
clearly
would
not.
but
since
this
court--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
i
think
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
named
defendants
were
the
ones
that
had
a
culpable
state
of
mind.
if
in
fact
the
warden
is
the
only
named
defendant,
there
would--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--i
think
in
that
instance,
under
a
1983
action
there
would
not
be
a
culpable
state
of
mind
present
on
behalf
of
a
named
defendant,
and
yes,
there
would
be
no
actionable
eighth
amendment
conduct.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
no,
your
honor,
they
could
sue--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
there
would
be
a
remedy--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--within
the
state
courts,
if
this
did
not
rise
to
constitutional--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--deprivation.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
if
there
was
in
fact
the
proper
named
defendant
with
a
culpable
state
of
mind
named--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--as
alluded
to
in--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--in
the
earlier
questions,
there
could
in
fact
be
a
collective
state
of
mind
type
of
inquiry
based
on--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--whether
the
legislature
or
the
governor--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--i
believe
you
could
sue
the
governor
or
you
could
sue
the
legislature
itself.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
the
governor
does
have
the
ability
in
a
fiscal
emergency
to
take
over
and
appropriate
monies
where
necessary,
so
in
fact
that
could
be
a
resolution
within
the
federal
judiciary,
as
well
as
having
the
ability
to
sue
the
state
[inaudible].
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
it
is,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
if
there
is
in
fact
a
condition
that
constitutes
punishment,
deprives
a
basic
human
need,
and
is
done
with
a
wanton
and
obdurate
state
of
mind,
that
that
would
be
the
only
way
in
which
an
eighth
amendment
violation
should
be
able
to
be
made
out.
if
in
fact
there
is
any
of
those
three
elements
missing,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
that
should
in
fact
be
fatal
to
an
eighth
amendment
claim.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--when
looking
at
conditions
of
confinement,
your
honor,
there
are
in
fact
competing
governmental
interests
at
issue.
security
and
financial
concerns
play
a
role.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
when
this
court
looked
to
the
medical
claims
raised
in
estelle
v.
gamble,
i
believe
they
in
fact
identified
that
the
interests
of
the
inmate
in
being
free
from
physical
injury
were
paramount.
however,
when
looking
at
conditions
of
confinement,
we
are
looking
to
conditions
that
are
uncomfortable
but
do
not
involve
the
type
of
detriment
to
bodily
integrity,
injury,
or
illness
that
could
result
in
a
medical
case.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
at
the
point--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--that
is
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
at
the
point
in
time
when
there
is
a
serious
medical
need
that
arises
that
prison
officials
had
been
deliberately
indifferent
to,
there
would
be
an
actionable
eighth
amendment
violation.
but
when
the
conditions
are
simply
something
that
is
more
hypothetical
in
nature
and
does
not--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--if
there
is
no
deprivation--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
if
the...
the
deliberate
indifference
test
should
apply
when
looking
at
medical
needs.
prior
to
a
condition
becoming
a
medical
need,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
showing
some
form
of
malice
because
of
the
competing
societal
interests
at
issue
here.
in
fact,
if
looking
at
petitioner's
own
claims,
can
give
examples.
petitioner
claims
that
there
is
a
lack
of
ventilation
in
the
dormitory,
and
that
this
is
true
because
there
is
a
requirement
on
behalf
of
the
prison
officials
to
close
the
fire
doors,
and
that
crash
gates
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairwell
will
be
sufficient
to
hold
prisoners.
clearly
this
is
an
example
of
a
clear
security
question
that
must
be
left
to
the
deference
of
prison
officials.
the
petitioner
also
claims
or
challenges
his
classification
in
the
particular
institution
that
he
is
assigned
to,
and
then
his
classification
or
assignment
to
the
dormitory
facility
that
he
is
in.
again,
this
goes
to
the
very
core
of
security-type
of
determinations
that
prison
officials
must
be
afforded
wide
deference
to.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
claims
that
he
raises
that
has...
that
he
has
challenged
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
yes,
in
fact
it
is.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
courts
are
ill
equipped
to
deal
with
the
increasing
urgent
problems
of
prison
administration,
and
that
it
would
be
not
wise
to
second-guess
the
expert
administrators
on
matters
to
which
they
are
better
informed.
this
court
has
in
fact
readily
recognized
that
there
are
security
and
special
expertise-type
of
decisions
on
behalf
of
prison
officials
that
must
be
afforded
wide
deference.
the
united
states
in
this
case
attempts
to
in
essence
apply
a
no
state
of
mind
test
when
looking
at
conditions
of
confinement.
it
is
clear
that
when
this
court
has
looked
at
any
eighth
amendment
case,
the
inquiry
is
whether
the
claim
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
petitioner
attempts,
as
well
as
united
states,
to
apply
a
test
that
disregards
prison
officials'
state
of
mind.
in
fact
that
clearly
runs
afoul
of
this
court's
decision
in
whitley
v.
albers,
and
in
fact
runs
afoul
of
a
number
of
other
decisions
of
this
court.
first
off,
in
whitley
this
court
defined
wanton
and
obdurate
behavior
as
requiring
in
fact
malicious
and
sadistic
for
the
very
purpose
of
causing
harm
type
of
mind
set.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
and
estelle
v.
gamble
is
another
example
of
the
use
of
a
state
of
mind
analysis
when
looking
at
medical
cases.
the
court
found
that
there
had
to
be
deliberate
indifference
to
a
serious
medical
need.
again
in
graham
v.
connor
this
court,
when
examining
a
fourth
amendment
question,
looked
at
the
very
terminology
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
was
compared
to
the
eighth
amendment,
and
found
that
the
terms
"cruel"
and
"punishment"
clearly
require
an
intent
or
some
inquiry
into
the
intent
analysis,
whereas
the
terms
"unreasonable"
from
the
fourth
amendment
did
not.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
the
state
of
mind
is
equally
important
whether
it
is
a
physical--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--well,
it
may
not
matter
what
the
intent
of
the
official
is
to
you--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--it
certainly
would
make
equally
as
much
sense
to
look
at
the
intent
of
the
prison
officials
in
a
medical-type
of
context.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
in
that
instance,
if
an
inmate
were
being
choked
by
a
prison
official,
there
is
no
question
but
that
malicious
intent
would
in
almost
all
instances
under
that
type
of
hypothetical
be
implied.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
i
believe
what
we're...
what
we
are
here
to
consider--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
it
is...
it
is
the
necessity
of
using
a
persistent
malicious
cruelty
test
that
will
afford
the
proper
deference
to
prison
officials'
decision
making.
the
lower--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
the
distinction
between
estelle
and
this
type
of
a
situation
is
when
you
are
looking
at
systemic
conditions
of
confinement
there
is
not
yet
the
type
of
physical
injury
or
illness
that
is
in
fact
identifiable
in
a
medical
case.
in
the
deliberate
indifference
context
there
is
a
specific
individual
that
is
in
fact
seriously
ill,
and
there
has
been
a
disregard
of
that
inmate's
medical
needs.
when
looking
at
conditions
of
confinement
there
is
a
need
to
look
at
not
only
whether
the
prison
officials
had
knowledge
of
the
existing
conditions,
but
what
actions
they
took
to
cure
those
existing
conditions,
and
what
barriers
to
action
there
were,
if
any,
financial
or
any
otherwise
type
of
barriers,
to
their
ability
to
cure
deficient
conditions.
we
believe
the
lower
court's
definition
of
persistent
malicious
cruelty
allows
the
ability
for
examination
of
good
faith
remedial
efforts
taken
to
cure
deficient...
allegedly
deficient
conditions,
and
also
allows
the
ability
to
look
at
whether
there
is
ongoing
policies
in
place
to
maintain
habitable
conditions,
such
as
were
in
place
at
the
hocking
correctional
facility.
this
court
in
whitley
v.
albers
was
clear
to
identify
that
inadvertence
or
error
in
good
faith
should
not
be
identified
as
actionable
conduct.
we
believe
the
persistence
element
of
the
lower
court's
test
proscribes
that
just
that
type
of
conduct
should
not
be
actionable.
in
addition,
the
petitioner's
claims
here
fail
to
present
any
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
regarding
any
condition
of
his
confinement.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
in
that
case
this
court
looked
to
the
conditions
existing
at
the
southern
ohio
correctional
facility
and
found
that
in
fact
double-celling
did
not
violate
the
minimal
civilized
measure
of
life's
necessities.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
i
believe
this
court
did
not
need
to
reach
that
question
because
they
found
that
there
was
no
deprivation
of
a
basic
human
need.
once
that
element
was
not
satisfied,
the
culpable
state
of
mind
inquiry
really
did
not
become
relevant.
so
while
this
court
did
not
directly
address
the
question
of
whether
culpable
state
of
mind
was
necessary
in
the
rhodes
v.
chapman
decision,
it
is
our
interpretation
that
that
simply
was
not
a
necessary
inquiry
to
at
that
point
inquire
into.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
my
understanding
is
that
there
are
no...
no
decisions
since
the
1981
decision
in
rhodes
v.
chapman
that
either
limits
it
to
its
facts
or
in
any
way
overrules
that
decision.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
what
they
did
objectively
in
this
case,
your
honor?
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
no,
your
honor,
i
still
believe--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--in
rhodes
v.
chapman,
i
believe
the
answer--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--would
be
no.
in
rhodes
v.
chapman
this
court
found
that
there
was
no
deprivation
of
basic
human
need.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
three-part
test
that
requires
an
analysis
into
whether
the
conditions
constitute
punishment,
whether
they
were
inflicted
by
a
prison
official
acting
with
a
wanton
and
obdurate
state
of
mind,
and
in
fact
whether
there
was
a
deprivation
of
a
basic
human
need.
and
failure
to
present
any
of
those
three
claims
should
be
fatal
to
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
in
fact
the
attempt
to
apply
what
the
petitioner
and
the
united
states
are
attempting
to
argue
here
would
result
in,
in
essence,
strict
liability
on
behalf
of
prison
officials.
all
good
faith
remedial
efforts--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
united
states
concedes
that
there
should
be
examination
of
state
of
mind
when
looking
at
a
damage
action,
and
tries
to
limit
their
argument
to
simply
injunctive
relief.
however,
it,
that
simply
runs
afoul
of
this
court's
analysis
of
general
1983
law.
in
fact
in
daniels
v.
williams
and
davidson
v.
cannon
this
court
considered
fourteenth
amendment
claims
and
found
that
there
was
in
fact
a
need
to
find
something
more
than
lack
of
due
care
or
negligence
to
trigger
the
protection
of
the
due
process
clause.
and
in
daniels
this
court
specifically
stated
that
in
any
given
1983
suit
the
plaintiff
must
prove
a
violation
of
the
underlying
constitutional
right,
and
depending
on
the
right,
merely
negligent
conduct
simply
may
not
be
enough.
when
looking
at
the
right
in
question
here,
the
eighth
amendment,
clearly
this
court
has
recognized
that
an
intent
element
is
a
necessary
inquiry
to
make
out
any
eighth
amendment
violation.
so
what
the
united
states
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
proscribe
for
injunctive
relief
a
different
form
of
identifying
the
cause
of
action,
and
in
fact
it
is
the
state's
position
that
that
would
simply
be
incorrect.
the...
in
a
conditions
of
confinement
case,
malice
is
required
here
to
show
a
wanton--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--in
those
cases,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
court
was
looking
more
to
the
element
of
whether
something
was
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--and
if
something
is
in
fact
intended
as
punishment--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--in
imposing
the
death
penalty--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
solely
limited
to
the
conditions
of
confinement
context.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
it
would
certainly
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
state's
position,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
i
think
that
would
still
be
consistent
with
the
state's
position
and
consistent
with
the
precedents
of
this
court,
yes,
your
honor.
when
looking
at
the
question
of
the
procedural
nature
of
this
case
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
is
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
not
a
motion
to
dismiss.
summary
judgment
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
an
important
tool
to
expeditiously
resolve
disputes.
summary
judgment
preserves
the
rights
of
parties
to
have
their
disputes
heard,
and
enables
judges
to
determine
without
trial
cases
in
which
no
genuine
issue
of
material
facts
exists.
the
courts'
ability
to
utilize
summary
judgment
is
particularly
important
when
looking
at
eighth
amendment
claims
of
pro
se
prisoners
who
are
entitled
to
liberal
construction
of
their
pleadings
and
who
make
conclusory
allegations
fairly
often
that
they
have
been
denied
the...
in
fact
the
eighth
amendment
rights,
or
that
they
have
been
subjected
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
as
noted
by
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
19
state's
attorneys
general,
by
any
gauge
prisoners
are
a
group
of
prolific
litigators.
the
volume
of
prison
litigation
has
been
steadily
increasing.
petitioner
himself
is
a
classic
example
of
an
individual
adding
to
the
congestion
in
the
federal
courts.
in
the
last
2
years
alone
he
has
filed
over
24
federal
court
appeals,
and
since
1976
himself
has
filed
over
70
federal
court
appeals.
while
state
of
mind
is
in
fact
a
factual
question
that
may
not
be
resolved
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
it
clearly
is
an
essential
inquiry
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
if
the
actions
taken
by
prison
officials
to
show
their
state
of
mind
are
not
relevant
in
conditions
of
confinement
cases,
a
prisoner
could
defeat
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
merely
by
making
conclusory
statements
that
mirror
or
reflect
a
conclusory
complaint.
it
is
unavoidable
that
conditions
of
confinement
will
be
objectionable
to
prisoners.
however,
good
faith
efforts
made
by
prison
officials
to
in
fact
provide
prisoners
with
habitable
conditions
must
be
considered
in
the
summary
judgment
analysis.
to
evaluate
whether
petitioner
has
in
fact
presented
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact,
this
court
must
evaluate
the
objective
facts
to
determine
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
the
petitioner
has
been
denied
the
minimal
civilized
measure
of
life's
necessities,
and
whether
prison
officials
acted
with
a
wanton
and
obdurate
state
of
mind.
petitioner
here
has
not
been
denied
any
minimal
civilized
measure
of
life's
necessity,
which
has
been
defined
to
include
food,
clothing,
shelter,
medical
care,
and
reasonable
safety.
the
threshold
level
at
which
unpleasant
conditions
become
a
constitutional
violation
is
not
defined
by
the
point
at
which
petitioner
himself
is
personally
offended.

no,
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
has
directly
recognized
in
anderson
that
state
of
mind
question
are
certainly
appropriate
for
disposition
on
summary
judgment.
in
fact
the
inquiry
is
the
same
as
it
would
be
at
a
trial
on
a
directed
verdict
question.
and
the
question
is
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
that
there
is--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
i
think
this...
in
all
due
deference,
i
believe
this
court
has
previously
recognized
in
anderson
that
there
is
an
ability
to
decide
questions
of
state
of
mind
on
a
summary
judgment
level
as
well
as
on
a
directed
verdict
level
at
trial.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
correct.
and
on
this
record
we
believe
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
concluded
that
the
respondents
here
acted
with
a
wanton
and
obdurate
state
of
mind,
or
that
the
petitioners
were
denied
the
minimal
civilized
measure
of
life's
necessities.
when
looking
solely
at
the
objective
facts
that
show
the
efforts
taken
by
prison
officials,
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner's
complaints
simply
do
not
state
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
regardless
of
whether
this
court
defines
wanton
and
obdurate
for
purposes
of
conditions
of
confinement
cases
as
requiring
deliberate
indifference
or
persistent
malicious
cruelty,
there
is
no
question
but
the
petitioner
has
simply
presented
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
for
this
court.
the
petitioner
has
made
a
series
of
complaints
that
basically
identify
that
he
is
not
pleased
with
being
housed
in
a
dormitory
facility.
he
believes
that
there
is
inadequate
cooling;
he
believes
that
the
restrooms
are
unclean
and
the
kitchen
facilities
are
unclean
and
that
there
is
excessive
noise.
however,
the
record
shows
by
undisputed
affidavits
that
petitioner's
claims
that
he
is
occasionally
subjected
to
95
degree
temperatures,
which
certainly
all
ohio
residents
without
air
conditioning
are
likewise
subjected
to,
shows
that
the
ventilation
is
adequately
maintained
during
summer
months
by
open
windows
and
two
large
fans
that
are
placed
at
each
end
of
the
dormitory.
petitioner's
claims
of
unclean
restrooms
and
kitchen
facilities
are
also
countered.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
restrooms
are
cleaned
two
times
a
day
and
additionally
spot
cleaned
as
needed.
the
kitchen
areas
and
dining
room
areas
are
cleaned
after
every
meal,
and
that
prison
individuals
that
work
in
the
kitchens
are
required
to
wear
plastic
gloves
and
hats.
and
in
fact
both
inmates
and
prison
staff--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
i
believe
what
the
lower
court
did
was
identify
that
whitley
v.
albers'
wantonness
and
obduracy
is
what
controls
the
analysis
of
conditions
of
confinement
claims.
they
then
did
add
an
additional
sentence
that
said
that
wantonness
and
obduracy
would
be
defined
as
behavior
marked
by
persistent
malicious
cruelty.
the
court
did
not
apply
the
whitley
v.
albers
test,
which
has
been
argued
by
our
opponent.
in
fact
there
was
no...
nowhere
in
the
entirety
of
the
opinion
the
word
sadistic
utilized.
unquestionably
an
analysis
that
looked
at
a
sadistic
state
of
mind
would
have
required
additional
evidence
than
simply
showing
malice.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
clearly
there
was
an
inquiry
into
state
of
mind,
without
question,
and
the
lower
court
found,
correctly,
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
could
have
supported
a
reasonable
jury
determination
that
the
prison
officials
acted
with
a
wanton
and
obdurate
state
of
mind.
and
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
that
regardless
of
what
standard
is
utilized
for
analyzing
wantonness
and
obduracy,
be
that
deliberate
indifference
or
malice
or
persistent
malicious
cruelty,
the
outcome
in
this
case
is
the
same.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
show
that
the
prison
officials
in
any
way
acted
with
a
wanton
and
obdurate
state
of
mind.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
was
never
intended
to
serve
as
an
escape
from
the
unpleasantness
of
imprisonment.
ohio
does
not
seek
to
operate
its
prisons
without
regard
to
prisoners'
constitutional
rights.
however,
inmates
should
not
be
encouraged
to
use
the
federal
courts
as
arbiters
of
grievances
for
what
amount
to
only
uncomfortable
living
conditions.
the
lower
court
imposed
a
meaningful
test
that
protects
the
rights
of
inmates
and
still
allows
appropriate
deference
to
prison
officials'
decision
making.
therefore,
respondents
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
by
the
lower
court.
thank
you,
your
honors.
