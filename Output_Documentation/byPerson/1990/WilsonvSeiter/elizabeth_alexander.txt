ms.
elizabeth
alexander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
allow
relief
directed
at
continuing
conditions
of
prison
confinement
unless
the
individual
defendants
in
the
case
acted
with
persistent
malicious
cruelty
in
maintaining
the
conditions
of
confinement.
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
in
this
case
would
mean
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
in
the
nation's
prisons
could
fall
beneath
any
standard
of
decency
without
redress
from
the
federal
courts.
the
truly
terrible
conditions
that
gave
rise
to
cases
such
as
hutto
v.
finney
would
return.
to
affirm
the
lower
court
would
mean
that
even
if
a
prison
deprived
prisoners
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life
on
a
continuing
basis,
that
fact,
regardless
of
the
consequences
in
suffering
and
death
to
the
prisoners,
would
not
be
enough
to
justify
federal
court
intervention.
for
this
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court
would
necessarily
mean
abandoning
the
holdings
of
rhodes
v.
chapman,
of
estelle
v.
gamble,
of
west
v.
atkins,
of
youngburgh
v.
romeo,
and
also
the
rationale
of
deshaney
v.
winnebago
county
dss,
that
government
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
supply
the
basic
necessities
of
life
to
those
whom
it
has
deprived
of
the
ability
to
supply
those
necessities
on
their
own.
affirming
the
lower
court
would
cause
serious
doctrinal
problems
because
it
would
in
effect
create
a
good
faith
immunity
defense
to
injunctive
actions.
such
a
holding
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
settled
rule
that
good
faith
immunities
apply
solely
to
damages
actions.
and
there
is
good
reason
for
this
rule
by
the
court.
giving
prison
officials
a
defense
against
damages
when
the
constitutional
deprivation
is
not
their
personal
fault
makes
sense.
denying
injunctive
relief
on
that
ground
makes
no
sense.
once
continuing
conditions
of
confinement
in
a
prison
are
bad
enough
to
violate
the
constitution
by
denying
the
basic
necessities
of
life,
the
point
of
injunctive
relief
is
to
end
the
suffering,
not
to
fix
the
blame.
no
case
in
this
court
supports
the
application
of
a
malice
standard
to
challenges
to
continuing
conditions
of
confinement.
no
case
in
the
courts
of
appeals
other
than
the
lower
court
decision
that
is
before
the
court
today
supports
such
a
result.
the
decision
below
is
inconsistent
with
fundamental
principles
of
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
established
by
this
court,
and
should
be
reversed.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
critical
issue
was
the
prison
officials'
state
of
mind,
and
that
the
affidavits
of
the
petitioner,
mr.
wilson,
did
not
put
in
issue
the
prison
officials'
state
of
mind
under
this
court's
decision
in
whitley
v.
albers.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
the
prison
officials
had
alleged
that
they
had
made
affirmative
efforts
to
improve
conditions,
they
could
not
be
acting
with,
quote,
"obduracy
and
wantonness",
and
then
there
is
an
ellipsis
from
the
court
of
appeals,
"marked
by
persistent
malicious
cruelty".
whether
one
construes
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
as
applying
the
full
whitley
prison
disturbance
standard
requiring
malice
and
sadism,
or
some
newly
invented
standard
of
the
lower
court
requiring
malice
but
not
requiring
sadism,
the
application
of
a
malice
standard
to
continuing
conditions
of
confinement
was
error.
this
case
is
governed
by
rhodes
v.
chapman,
in
which
the
court
dealt
with
a
challenge
to
continuing
conditions
of
confinement.
in
rhodes
this
court
held
that
eighth
amendment
challenges
to
continuing
conditions
of
confinement
should
be
examined
by
determining
whether
the
conditions,
alone
or
in
combination,
deprived
prisoners
of
the
minimal
civilized
measure
of
life's
necessities.
these
necessities,
as
set
forth
in
rhodes
and
later
in
deshaney,
include
food,
medical
care,
sanitation,
shelter,
and
reasonable
safety.
had
the
court
of
appeals
simply
applied
rhodes,
as
its
opinion
makes
clear,
it
would
have
remanded
most
of
wilson's
claims
for
trial.
wilson's
claim
of
a
lack
of
heat
provides
a
convenient
example
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
analyzed
this
case
under
rhodes
v.
chapman.
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
the
prison
officials
concede
that
a
lack
of
heat
can
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
wilson's
allegations
included
a
claim
of
a
lack
of
heat
since
the
prison
opened
in
1983.
a
lack
of
heat
is
an
obvious
condition.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
the...
there
are
several
affidavits
in
support
of
petitioner
that
make
slightly
different
claims.
all
of
them
are
consistent
with
the
claim
that
the
complete
is
completely
inadequate.
it
appears
that
there
is
some
form
of
heat.
one
affidavit
says
the
only
place
there
is
heat
is
right
around
the
central
toilet.
the
other
affidavits
say
things
such
as
because
of
the
frigid
air
going
through
the
large
cracks
in
the
walls,
prisoners
have
to
put
blankets
over
their
head.
and
therefore,
a
lack
of
heat
is
an
obvious
condition.
this
is
a
facility
with
three
living
units.
no
warden
in
a
facility
with
three
living
units
could
be
aware...
unaware
for
three
winters
of
that
sort
of
lack
of
heat
in
the
facility.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
for
continuing
conditions
of
confinement
no
state
of
mind
test
is
relevant.
however,
were
this
court
to
find
that
any
state
of
mind
test
were
to
be
imposed,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
still
erred
because
it
applied
the
wrong
test.
if
any
test
is
relevant,
and
we
think
it
is
not
for
continuing
conditions,
then
the
relevant
test
ought
to
be
deliberate
indifference.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
that...
our
position
is
that
in
fact,
while
it
makes
much
more
doctrinal
sense
to
simply
say
for
continuing
conditions
of
confinement
no
state
of
mind
test,
in
fact
that
analysis
is
going
to
come
out
the
same
way.
since
it's
going
to
come
out
the
same
way,
it
is
a
more
coherent
position
and
easier
for
the
federal
courts
to
apply
to
simply
say
there
is
no
state
of
mind
test.
because
it...
when
you
have
an
obvious
condition,
and
that
denies
someone
the
basic
necessity
of
life,
and
it
continues
for
3
years,
then
there
is
necessarily
deliberate
indifference.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
short-term
conditions
raise
different
issues.
they--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--in
this
sense,
in
the
rhodes...
in
both
hutto
and
in
rhodes
this
court
said
the
conditions
of
confinement
are
punishment.
and
that
is
consistent
with
what
we
think
we...
with
our
idea
of
what
punishment
is.
that
is
the
conditions
that
you
have
in
your
cell
for
a...
that
continue,
those
are
what
we
mean
as
punishment.
and
for
those
conditions,
there
is
no
state
of
mind
test.
the
reason
that
in
whitley
the
court
applied
the
state
of
mind
test
was
that
it
was
dealing
with
conditions
that
were
not
imposed...
were
not
said
to
be
imposed
as
punishment,
and
therefore
it's
important
to
know
why
they
are.
and
that
distinction
works
when
you
look
at
long-term
and
short-term
things.
if
some...
if
a
condition
in
a
cell
continues
for
3
years,
then
it
is
part
of
the
punishment.
if
the
heat
fails
for--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
would
agree
with
that.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
would
agree
that
the
tests
come
out
exact...
precisely
the
same.
if
you
look
at
the
short-term
situation,
and
whitley
was
in
this
sense
a
short-term
situation,
it
looks,
it
makes
more
sense
to
find
out
why
it
happened.
if
there
is
no
heat
because
the
boiler
broke,
even
if
it
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
prison
officials,
then
that's
a
different
situation.
what
stops
being
different
is,
for
whatever
reason
the
boiler
broke,
if
3
years
later
it's
not
working,
that's
part
of
the
punishment.
that's
also
deliberate
indifference,
if
that
analysis
is
relevant.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
if
i
could
respond
to
your
second
question
regarding
the
language
in
whitley
first.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
the
first
thing
is
that
the
language,
obdurate
and
wantonness,
it
was
quoted
at
that
point
in
whitley,
comes
first
from
gregg
v.
georgia
and
later
from
rhodes
v.
chapman.
in
both
those
cases
when
that
language
was
used
it
was
used
to
refer
to
the
effects
of
the...
of
the
policy
or
condition
on
people.
it
wasn't
in
fact
in
those
cases
used
to
refer
to
a
state
of
mind.
the
second
thing
i
would...
and
that
seems
to...
that's
one
way
to
reconcile
that
language
in
whitley.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
it
seems
to
me
that
the
other
way
to
reconcile
that
dictum
in
whitley
is
to
say
that
the
precise
language
that
the
court
was
using
at
that
point
was
conduct.
we
agree
that
there
is
a
difference
about
whether
or
not
state
of
mind
applies
to
short-term
conduct.
and
in
a...
and
that
distinction
between
short-term
events
and
continuing
conditions
or
formal
government
policies,
reconciles
all
the
court's
eighth
amendment
decisions
easily.
it
also,
by
the
way,
reconciles
estelle
v.
gamble.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
the
distinction
reconciles
all
this
court's
cases
in
the
eighth
amendment
area.
in
fact,
when
the
court
has--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
agree
that
if
one,
if
courts
go
through
the
analysis
on
long-term
events
they
will
always
come
to
the
same
result.
that
is
that
the
deliberate
indifference
test
in
practice
will
be
satisfied.
i
think,
however,
it
is...
it
is
less...
it
is
less
complicated
and
makes
more
sense...
of
all
the
cases
from
stanford
v.
kentucky,
rhodes
v.
chapman,
and
so
forth,
in
which
this
court
has
not
remotely
suggested
that
a
state
of
mind
was
an
element
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation
to
look
at
it
this
way
when
there
is
an
official
government
policy,
or
when
there
is
a
continuing
condition,
so
that
the
conditions
are
necessarily
part
of
the
punishment,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
look
at
state
of
mind.
indeed
the
precise
language
from
rhodes
v.
chapman
is
we
held
in
hutto
v.
finney
that...
well,
i
am
obviously
paraphrasing
broadly...
because
the
conditions
in
that
case
were
so
bad,
there
was
a
violation
of
the...
the
conditions
violated
the
eighth
amendment.
there
is
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
rhodes
v.
chapman
that
any
state
of
mind
was
relevant
in
determining
whether
a
continuing
condition
of
confinement
violated
the
eighth
amendment.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes.
and
the
reason
it
did
so
is
that
the
court
majority
in
estelle
also
viewed
that
as,
as
a
one
time
short-term
event,
a
series
of
limited
individual
interactions
with
the
medical
department.
justice
stevens
in
dissent
instead
said
this
looks
to
me
as
if
it
could
be
a
systemic
case,
and
then
said,
and
i
think
this
was
a
prescient
comment,
when
it's...
when
you
look
at
something
as
a
systemic
case,
then
it's
irrelevant
for
there
to
be
any
state
of
mind
test
under
the
eighth
amendment.
given
the
court's
construction
in
estelle
of
the
medical
claim
in
that
case
as
a
one-time
event,
then
the
court's
decision
to
use
a
deliberate
indifference
standard
makes
sense.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
no,
because
given...
the
only
point--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--you
would
reach
the
same
result.
i
agree
with
that.
however,
given
that
you
would
always
reach
the
same
result
when
you
have
an
obvious
condition
that
deprives
prisoners
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life,
then
there
is
no
need
to
put
this
extra
complication
in
the
law
requiring
courts
to
look
at
a
state
of
mind.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
apologize,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
by
systemic,
because
it's
a
word
usually
used
in
the
medical
area,
is
that...
is
equivalent
to
long
term.
that
is
a
continuing
denial
of
the
basic
necessity--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--even
to
one
prisoner.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
want
to
begin
by
going
back
to
the
last
series
of
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
asked
opposing
counsel.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
most
of
the
claims
raised
by
wilson
did
suggest
the
type
of
seriously
indecent
conditions
that,
if
proven,
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
that
is,
the
first
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
not
the
state
of
mind
analysis,
but
whether
the
conditions
alleged
were
bad
enough
that
there
was
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
on
that
ground
it
has
already
said
yes,
most
of
these
claims
do
rise
to
that
level.
i...
as
to
the...
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
point
about
whether
or
not
rhodes
has
anything
to
say
about
whether
or
not
the
state
of
mind
analysis
applies.
i
submit
that
the
court's
discussion
in
rhodes
of
the
hutto
case
makes
very
clear
that
in
rhodes
this
court
saw
no
reason
for
a
state
of
mind
test.
the
court
in
rhodes
makes
clear
that
in
hutto
v.
finney
the
constitution
was
violated
because
the
conditions
were
so
bad.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
that
language
that
there
was
some
other
element
necessary
for
it.
and
rhodes
and
hutto
also
say
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
are
punishment,
because
they
are...
and
that's
why
they
are
to
be
analyzed
as
they
are.
because
they
are
punishment
in
a
sense,
i
think
that
they
are
equivalent
to
justice
scalia's
point
about
don't
we
know
that
these
are
intentionally
imposed.
when
the
conditions
are
in
the
sense
that
one
intends
the
natural
consequences
of
one's
act
imposed
on
a
condition,
on
a
continuing
basis,
those
are
part
of
the
punishment.
given
that
they
are
part
of
the
punishment,
then
whitley
simply
isn't
relevant,
because
whitley
is
a
case
that
analyzes
when
some
particular
conduct
that
is
not
imposed
as
punishment
might
nonetheless
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
stevens
asked...
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
have
one
other
point
i
want
to
go
to.
i
want
to
go
back
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
difference
between
damages
and
injunctive
actions.
now,
the
first
point
and
i
think
the
central
point
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
standard
for
either
injunctive
actions
or
damages
actions
is
the
same.
the
standard
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
the
same,
but
of
course
there
are
differences
when
one
is
speaking
about
damages
with
regard
to
special
defenses
that
apply
the
damages
and
not
injunctive
actions,
and--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--the
major
authority,
your
honor,
that
i
would
cite
is
the
youngburgh
case,
and
that
is
where
i
wanted
to
go
next.
justice
stevens
asked
about
the
financial
issues,
and
the
prison
officials
in
this
case
have
made
no
claim
at
all
that
the
reason
that
they
failed
to
supply
the
necessities
of
life
has
to
do
with
financial
reasons.
but
let's
assume
that
they
did.
then
there
would
come
a
time
when
there
would
be
a
difference
between
damages
and
injunctive
actions,
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
youngburgh
if
a
professional
is
prevented
from
doing
his
or
her
duty
because
of
a
lack
of
finances,
then
that
is
a
defense
in
damages.
and
it
can't
possibly--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--against
the
professional
only.
it
can't...
you
can't
possibly
apply
that
defense,
of
course,
in
injunctive
actions,
because
if
you
did,
and
there
was
some
question
about
isn't...
shouldn't
we
look
for
deliberate
indifference
from
someone.
and,
imagine
how
hard
in
an
injunctive
action
it
would
be
to
figure
out
who
actually
was
the
person
who
denied
the
