will
you
help
me
on
this
state
of
mind
point?
if
you
cut
off
my
breathing
and
stop
me
from
breathing,
does
it
matter
to
me
as
to
what
your
state
of
mind
is?
justice

does
it
matter
to
me
while
i'm
being
strangled?
justice
marshall
of
course
it
doesn't.
justice
marshall
well,
what
other
reason
would
he
do
it,
other
than
to
choke
me?
justice
marshall
you
would
have
to...
it
would
be
implied?
justice
marshall
but
you
would
have
to
consider
it?
justice
marshall
so
what
we're
arguing
about
is
considering
and
applying
it.
justice
marshall
when
they
complain
about
the
air
coming
in
the
room
and
freezing
them,
we
have
to
find
out
whether
they
intended
that
maliciously?
justice
marshall
they
did
it
knowing
full
well
what
they
were
doing.
but
in
addition
to
that
you
have
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
it
was
malicious?
