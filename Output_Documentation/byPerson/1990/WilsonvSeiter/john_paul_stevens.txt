justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
you
mentioned
financial
concerns.
would
it
always
be
a
defense
to
a
warden,
no
matter
how
bad
the
conditions
were,
to
say
i
tried
to
get
money
from
the
legislature
but
they
wouldn't
appropriate?
justice
stevens
but
why
not?
because
he
was
acting
entirely
in
good
faith,
nothing
wanton
about
what
he
is
doing.
he
just
can't
get
the
money.
justice
stevens
well,
they
name
everybody
on
the
prison
staff,
and
they
are
all
boy
scouts.
they
want
to
help
as
much
as
they
can,
but
the
legislature
didn't
appropriate
the
money.
justice
stevens
and
who
could
the...
who
could
the
prisoners
sue?
could
they
sue
the
state?
justice
stevens
so
there'd
be...
there
would
be
no
remedy
in
the
case
i
pose
then?
justice
stevens
what
would
the
remedy--
justice
stevens
--oh,
in
the
state
courts.
justice
stevens
but
there
would
be
no
federal
remedy?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
there
is
nobody
who
has
a
culpable
state
of
mind.
they
are
all
trying
to
help
the
prisoners,
but
they
cannot
get
the
money
because
the
legislature
won't
appropriate.
and
they
have
the
conditions,
just...
andersonville.
you
cannot
imagine
worse
conditions,
but
there
is
no
remedy
under
your
proposal.
justice
stevens
no
federal
remedy.
justice
stevens
on
behalf
of
whom?
justice
stevens
but
who...
but
who
do
you
sue
for
that
collective
state
of
mind?
don't
you
have
to
sue
the
state?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
the
governor
also
urged
such
legislation,
but
the
legislature
just
wouldn't
pass
it?
justice
stevens
but
he
would
be
guilty
of
violating
the
eighth
amendment
if
he
did
not
exercise
his
extraordinary
power
to
appropriate
that
kind
of
money,
even
though
he
thought
it
was
in
the
best
interest,
but
as
a
matter
of
political
philosophy
he
thought
the
legislature
ought
to
be
doing
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
rhodes
case?
supposing
there
had
been
proof...
it
is
very
unlikely,
but
there
had
been
internal
memoranda,
smoking
guns,
and
all
sorts
of
things,
that
proved
that
the
warden
and
his
staff
just
hated
these
prisoners
and
had
a
malicious
state
of
mind,
but
all
they
did
was
just
exactly
what
they
did
objectively
there.
an
eighth
amendment
violation
or
no?
justice
stevens
no,
what
they
did
objectively
in
rhodes
against
chapman.
you
have
those
conditions,
but
they
were
in
fact
motivated
by
a
malicious
state
of
mind
because
the
warden
and
his
colleagues
just
hated
these
prisoners,
but
they
thought
they
couldn't
get
away
with
anything
more
than
what
they
did.
justice
stevens
they
imposed
double-celling
because
they
thought
it
would
make
the
prisoners
uncomfortable,
and
they
wanted
to
do
it
to
harm
them.
justice
stevens
would
that
violate--
justice
stevens
--so
the
malicious
state
of
mind
is
not
the
sole
criteria?
justice
stevens
it's
just
one
of...
a
necessary,
but
not
a
sufficient
condition.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you
again,
if
i
may.
what
about
our
capital
punishment
cases?
is
there
any
requirement
of
a
malicious
intent
on
the
part
of
the
state?
say,
you
can't
impose
the
death
sentence
for
the
crime
of
rape.
that
is
true
regardless
of
what
the
state's
intent
is,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
there's
no
requirement
that
the
state
be
motivated
by
any
kind
of
special
malicious
intent
in
those
cases.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
so
you're...
this
is
just...
your
argument
goes
only
to
confinement
cases?
