justice
kennedy
and
when
you
say
that,
are
you
implying
that
you
would
accept
a
test
that
included
deliberate
indifference
as
one
of
the
components?
justice
kennedy
but
you
can
tell...
you
can
make
that
determination
by
looking
at
objective
factors,
can't
you?
you
can
make
an
inference?
i
mean,
you
said
yourself,
no
warden
could
let
this
go
on
for
3
years
without
knowing
about
it.
justice
kennedy
well,
then
you
say
that
if
something
is
unintentional,
completely
unforeseeable
by
the
officials,
it
is
necessarily
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
we
have
one
test
for
short-term
conditions
and
another
for
long
term?
justice
kennedy
but
there
is
also
a
showing
of
deliberate
indifference.
justice
kennedy
because
you
use
objective
facts
to
determine
an
institutional
state
of
mind.
justice
kennedy
but
we
could
say
that
the
state
is.
the
state
legislature
is
guilty
of
deliberate
indifference
in
the
hypothetical
you--
justice
kennedy
--i
don't
consider
it
a
fiction
if
the
legislature
is
in
default
of
an
obvious
duty.
justice
kennedy
so
cruel
and
unusual
does
have
an
intentional
component?
justice
kennedy
they're
just
inhuman,
but
they
are
not
medical?
justice
kennedy
that's
a
very
odd
line,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
kennedy
what
authority
do
you
have
that
1983
liability,
if
we
accept
the
standard
you
propose,
would
be
limited
so
far
as
damages
are
concerned?
