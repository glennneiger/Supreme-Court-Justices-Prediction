mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
in
this
case
can
be
stated
very
simply,
and
that
is
that
a
prisoner
is
subjected
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
if
the
conditions
of
his
confinement
deny
him
a
minimal
level
of
basic
human
needs.
now,
it
follows
from
that
that
where
the
conditions
of
confinement
are
at
issue
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
mind
and
certainly
no
need
to
inquire
to
find
that
the
conditions
are
the
product
of,
and
i
quote,
"persistent
malicious
cruelty",
as
the
defendants
in
the
court
of
appeals
suggest.
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--not...
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
into
the
reason.
that
is
right.
because
there
is
a
duty.
there
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
we
would
consider
to
be
the
prison
conditions.
that
is
something
that
happens
to
the
prison;
it
happens
to
the
people
who
live
outside
the
prison.
it
is
something
that's,
if
you
will,
an
act
of
god.
it
isn't
something
that
is
a
product
of
the
incarceration,
that
is
part
of
the
punishment--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
the
reason
we...
the
reason
we
resist
the
notion
of
negligence
or
resist
deliberateness
is
simply
this,
and
it's
really...
it
comes
down
to
the
class
of
cases
that
we
are
particularly
concerned
about
here.
and
that
is
suppose
that
the
warden,
the
prison
officials...
the
prison
officials
are
trying
to
do
a
good
job,
but
they
don't
have
the
resources.
there
is
some
reason
in
just
the
way
resources
are
allocated
by
the
legislature
or
requirements
of
law
that
they
can't
provide
the
services
that
are
basic
to
human
necessity,
human
life.
they
can't
provide
enough
decent
food.
they
can't
provide
enough
decent
shelter.
the
fact
that
they
aren't
acting
in
bad
faith,
deliberately,
or
even
negligently
should
not
be
a
defense
to
an
injunctive
action.
if
you
want--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you
could.
you
could.
your
honor,
you
could
say
that
there
is
a
collective
deliberate
indifference
by
virtue
of
somebody,
we
can't
point
the
finger
at
any
particular
person,
but
somewhere
out
there
there
is
deliberate
indifference
because
how
in
the
world
could
anybody
allow
conditions
like
this
to
continue
without
being
deliberately
indifferent.
now,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
created
a
fiction
if
you
do
that.
it
is
not,
in
our
view,
the
most
direct
way
to
approach
the
problem,
but
it's
going
to
be
a
way
that
will
result
in
most
instances,
perhaps
all
instances,
in
the
same
result.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
may
be
though.
when
you
speak
of
deliberate
indifference,
the
normal
sense
is
that
somebody
has
some
kind
of
moral
culpability
with
respect
to
the
conduct.
it
may
be
that
the...
nobody,
no
one
person
in
the
legislature
ever
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
situation
and
said
this
is
a
problem
but
we
are
not
going
to
attend
to
it.
so
if,
when...
normally
when
you
say
deliberate
indifference
you
are
talking
about
somebody
who
is
reckless
or
something
like
recklessness.
we
don't
think
that
should
be
required.
but,
of
course,
if
the
court
construes
the
term
deliberate
indifference
in
a
way
that
does
not
impose
this
kind
of
moral
requirement
of
recklessness,
but
simply
says
if
you
have
a
condition
which
is
a
general
condition
in
the
prisons
and
it
denies
people
the
necessities
of
life,
that's
deliberate
indifference,
then
you
come
out
exactly
where
we
come
out.
you
just
have
one
more
step
in
the
process.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
we
looked
to
the
cases--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
well,
i
would
look
first
to,
the
best
statement
is
the
deshaney
case.
if
i
can
just
read--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
did
discuss.
it
was
admittedly
dictum,
but
i
think
the
dictum
is
very
telling,
in
which
the
court
said
with
respect
explicitly
to
the
eighth
amendment,
it
said
that
there
is
a
duty
when
you
have
someone
in
your
custody...
you
have
taken
them
into
your
custody
and
you
have
thereby
deprived
them
of
the
ability
to
fend
for
themself,
that
if
they
are
nonprisoners
it's
the
due
process
clause,
if
they
are
prisoners
it's
the
eighth
amendment,
you
have
a
duty
to
provide
them
with
the
basic
necessities
of
life.
that,
your
honor,
is
the
position
that
this
court
set
forth--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
your
honor,
we
have,
in
rhodes
against
chapman,
in
hutto
against
finney,
the
court
has
said
essentially
the
same
thing.
i
think
not
as
clearly
as
in
the
deshaney
case
and
in
west
against
atkins,
and
again
in
youngburgh
against
romeo.
but
in
each
of
those
cases,
either
the
premise
or
the
explicit
point
was
that
there
is
a
duty
under
the
eighth
amendment,
in
a
case
in
which
you
have
somebody
in
your
custody,
to
provide
them
with
the
basic
necessities
of
life.
you
can't
let
someone
starve
when
you
have
deprived
him
of
the
ability
to
feed
himself.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
and
our
suggestion
is
no
intent.
our
suggestions
with
respect
to
that
precise
question
is
certainly
not
malicious
and
sadistic
intent
or
even
persistent
malicious
intent,
as
the
sixth
circuit
and
as
the
respondents
suggest.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
and
that
would
be
whitley
against
albers.
in
other
words,
you
can
have
cruel
and
usual
punishment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
does
in
the
case
in
which
one
person
sets
out
to
punish
another,
even
if
it
is
in
a
single
isolated
instance.
if
i,
as
a
prison
warden,
decide
to
punish
you,
prisoner
number
443,
by
arranging
for
your
cell
mate
to
attack
you,
that's
a
violation
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
and
you
can...
that
is
actionable.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that's
the
only
thing
that's
actionable,
and
it
doesn't
mean
that
although
state
of
mind
is
necessary
in
that
case,
because
it
is
an
isolated
instance,
that
state
of
mind
is
also
necessary
in
cases
involving
general
continuing
conditions.
i
think
the
problem,
to
reiterate,
which
we
see
with
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
and
that
the
respondents
are
arguing
for
is
that
it
leaves
a
major
hole
in
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
jurisprudence
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
for
years.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
radical
change
in
the
way
cruel
and
unusual
case...
punishment
cases
are
litigated.
this
is,
if
you
will
read
these
cases
one
after
another
in
the
lower
courts,
this
is
the
standard
they
have
used.
they
have
said
are
the
conditions
unacceptable?
if
they
are
and
it's
a
product
of
general
prison
conditions,
that's
a
violation.
and
i
think
if
this
court
in
fact
adopts
the
position
urged
upon
it
by
the
state,
that
will
be
a
radical
change
in
the
nature
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
litigation,
and
we
would
strongly
urge
that
the
court
not
follow
that
path.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
estelle
test
seems
to
me
to
go
more
to
the
nature
of
the
medical
care
that
is
adequate.
in
other
words--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
yes,
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right,
yes.
yes,
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
