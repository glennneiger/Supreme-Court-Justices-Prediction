we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-7376,
pearly
l.
wilson
v.
richard
seiter.
we'll
be
with
you
in
just
a
minute.
ms.
alexander,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
we
talking,
ms.
alexander,
about
a
comparative
lack
of
heat
or
a
total
lack
of
heat?
or
can
you
tell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
alexander.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bryson,
you
are
really
submitting
quite
a
broad
proposition
to
the
court,
not
so
much
about
intent,
but
the
idea
that
it
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
if
prisoners
are
not
provided
with
minimal,
what
you
regard
as
minimal,
what,
food,
clothing,
shelter?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
authority
do
you
have
from
this
court
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
go
ahead,
tell
me
what
the
authorities
are.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
deshaney
case
doesn't
deal
with
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
all
you
have
is
dicta
in
deshaney
for
this
sweeping
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
all
we
granted
certiorari
in
on
this
case
was
whether
the
malicious
and
sadistic
intent
requirement.
we
didn't
take
it
to
decide
a
whole
range
of
questions
as
to
what
sort
of
things
prisons
have
to
furnish.
it's
just
basically
a
question
of
what
is
the
intent
which
must
be
shown
when
they
fail
to
provide
something.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
of
the
hurricane,
i
take
it
if
the
prison
warden,
in
anger
at
the
prisoners,
had
so
arranged
the
heating
and
the
plumbing
that
the
same
conditions
applied,
you
would
say
that
was
cruel
and
unusual,
wouldn't
you?
in
other
words,
he
hoses
the
prisoners
down
with
water
and
turns
up
the
heat.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
ms.
eppler,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
does
he
contend,
ms.
eppler,
that
his
wrong
classification
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
strict
liability
against
action
for
an
injunction.
not
necessarily,
as
your
opponent
pointed
out,
in
action
for
damages.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
eppler,
this
wasn't
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
went
off
on,
that
these
things
were
not
deprivations,
whatever
the
state
of
mind.
they
said
that
in
order
for
them
to
be
deprivations
you
had
to
show
the
state
of
mind
set
forth
in
the
whitley
opinion,
and
really
didn't
get
to
the
question
of
whether,
had
that
state
of
mind
been
shown,
these
nevertheless
would
have
been
deprivations.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
wanton
and
obdurate
does...
which
are
the
words
the
court
of
appeals
did
use,
certainly
suggest
some
sort
of
subjective
inquiry.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
eppler.
ms.
alexander,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
alexander.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-7376
wilson
against
seiter
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
