justice
scalia
mr.
cerf,
can
i
interrupt
a
minute?
the...
you're
making
a
plain
language
kind
of
an
argument.
you
say
that
the
normal
meaning
of
conditions
of
confinement
suits
your
description
of
it.
but
if
i
understand
your
description,
if
i
have
a
claim
that,
as
a
prisoner,
for
1
week
i
was
thrown
into
a
dank
cell
with
no
toilet
facilities,
with
rats...
abysmal
conditions...
for
a
week,
and
i
bring
suit
about
that
one
incident.
i
don't
claim
that
it's
general
in
prison.
i
don't
claim
they've
done
it
to
me
before
or
will
do
it
to
me
afterwards.
i'm
just
complaining
about
that
1
week.
you
say
that
is
not
a
suit
that
relates
to
conditions
of
confinement?
justice
scalia
well,
why
do
you
say
it's
a
past
conditions
case?
you
say
it's
a
conditions
case
only
if
it's
on
going
and
continuing.
justice
scalia
gee,
but
if
clean
lines
is
the
criterion,
i
think...
i
think
you
lose,
because
that's
the
main
argument
that
the
other
side
has
going
for
it...
that
it's
a
lot
of
trouble
to
draw
any
of
these
lines
between
ongoing
and
non-ongoing
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
you
can
say
that
any
complaint
about
how
you're
treating...
treated
in
prison
relates
to
a
condition
of
your
confinement.
that's
a
nice
clean
line.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you've
answered
justice
souter's
concern.
it
isn't
the
fit
he's
concerned
about.
it's
the
fact
that
even
when
the
defendant...
when
the
plaintiff
is
willing
to
waive
the
jury
trial,
no
good
comes
of
this
provision
whatever
so
long
as
there's
a
claim
for
damages.
because
you
must
try
that
claim
for
damages
before
a
judge.
so
what's
the
good
of
trying...
being
able
to
try
the
injunction
portion
before
a
magistrate?
justice
scalia
so,
in
every
case
where
there...
where
there's
a
damage
claim,
you
may
as
well
not
have
the
provision.
justice
scalia
oh,
well,
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
position.
is
that
the
position
you
took
in
your
brief?
i--
justice
scalia
well,
isn't...
isn't
the...
isn't
the
prisoner
the
master
of
his
own
complaint?
even
if
there
is
a
regulation,
suppose
he
doesn't
challenge
it?
he
doesn't
care
about
the
regulation.
he
just
cares
about
what
he's
been
subjected
to.
are
you
saying
that
even
if
he
doesn't
ask
for
elimination
of
the
regulation,
even
if
he...
all
he
asks
for
is
money...
is
money
damages
for
the
past
violation,
it
would
still
be
a
condition--
justice
scalia
--of
confinement
case
by
virtue
of
the
mere
existence
of
the
regulation?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
so
it's
up
to
him.
he
can
make
it
a
condition
of
confinement
case
by
objecting
to
the
regulation,
or
if
he
doesn't
want
to
object
to
the
regulation...
just
wants
to
object
to
the
application
of
the
regulation
to
him,
it
becomes
not
a
condition
of
confinement
case.
justice
scalia
but
i
guess
the
other
side
would
say,
general,
that
this
plaintiff
didn't
care
about
those
conditions.
all
he
cared
about
was
the
single
incident.
whether
the
case
involves
the
conditions
depends
upon
what
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
relief
from.
if
he's
seeking
relief...
monetary
relief
for
a
past
event...
it
doesn't
involve
conditions.
it's
a
rational
line
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
i'm
not
focusing
on
conditions
of
confinement
now.
i'm
focusing
on
the
words
"petitions
challenging".
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
have
a
connotation
of
asking
you
to
stop,
asking
for
an
injunction
or...
or
a
declaratory
rather
than
asking
for
damages
for
something
that's
already
happened.
can
you
think
of
any
other
context
in
which
you'd
refer
to
a
damage
action
as
an
action
in
which
somebody
challenged
something.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--you
know,
if
you
socked
me
in
the
nose,
i
don't
bring
a
suit
challenging
your
punching
me
in
the
nose.
that
would
be
a
very
strange
way
to
put
it.
