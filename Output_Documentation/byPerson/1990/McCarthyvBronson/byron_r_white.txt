justice
white
what
was
he
seeking,
mr.
cerf?
damages?
justice
white
you
say
the
seventh
amendment
right
would
be
protected
i
suppose
just
by
the
prisoner
demanding
a
jury
trial
in
a
damages
case?
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
and
so
there
would
be
no
reference?
justice
white
and
to
that
extent
the
language
of
the
act
would
just
be
beside
the
point.
justice
white
well,
in
those...
in
the
damages
case
where
there's
a
demand
for
jury
trial,
the
aim
of
congress
just
wouldn't
be
effective
then?
