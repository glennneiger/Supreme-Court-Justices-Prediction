well,
isn't
there
one
further
wrinkle
to
it,
and
that
is
as
long
as
the
damage
action
was
kept
alive,
there
could
never
be
a
reference
in
what
i
would
imagine
was
the
run-of-the-mill
case
in
which
there's
a
request
for
damages
as
well
as
an
injunction.
there
could
never
be
a
reference
except
at
the
potential
cost
of
two
trials.
justice
souter
so
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
except
in
the
unusual
case
in
which
there
is
not
request
for
damages
based
on
the
past
incidents
of
the
practice
in
question,
there
never
can
be
a
reference.
justice
souter
but
why
doesn't
it
follow
from
your
position?
because
it
seems
to
me
the
only
way
out
of
it
would
be
for
the
court
to
say,
well,
we'll
take
a
chance
that
when
the
injunctive
proceedings
are
over
they'll
drop
the
damage
claim.
and
if
the...
if
the
court
doesn't
want
to
take
that
chance,
then
the
court
is
going
to
face
two
trials
or
the
potentiality
of
two
trials
in
every
instance.
justice
souter
your
rule
then
is
simply
a
rule
of
pleading.
if
he...
if
he
is
foolish
enough
to
mention
the
regulation,
we've
got
a
conditions
case.
if
he
is
laconic
enough
just
to
mention
what
happened
to
him
on
friday,
we
don't.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
matter
of
pleading.
