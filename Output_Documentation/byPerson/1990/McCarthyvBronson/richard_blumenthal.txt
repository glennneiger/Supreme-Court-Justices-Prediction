mr.
richard
blumenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
most
reasonable,
logical,
and
workable
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
the
one
that
was
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
which
would
include
all
grievances
occurring
during
prison
confinement.
it
is
supported
by
the
statutory
text
and
legislative
history.
it
doesn't
undercut
the
seventh
amendment.
it
offers
full
protection
to
any
prisoner's
seventh
amendment
right.
and
it
fulfills
most
importantly
what
was
congress'
purpose
in
the
1976
amendments,
which
was
to
broaden
the
authority
of
the
magistrates
and
ease
of
the
burden
of
the
federal
district
court
workload
and,
equally
importantly,
broaden
the
discretion
of
federal
judges
to
refer
matters
to
magistrates.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
like...
like
every
litigant--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
like
every
litigant,
a
prisoner
has
the
burden
of
demanding
a
jury
trial
within
the
limitations
of
rule
38.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
if
there
were
a
jury
trial
demand,
timely
made,
there
would
be
no
reference.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
it
would
not
be
beside
the
point,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
white.
it
would
enable
a
reference
in
the
absence
of
a
jury
demand--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--well,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
knew
that...
and
the
cases
are
pretty
clear
on
this...
that
pursuant
to
(b)(1)(b),
there
cannot
be
a
reference
for
a
jury
trial
by
the
magistrate.
and
we
don't
differ
at
all
with
the
petitioner
on
that
point.
but
we
also
i
think
have
to
assume
that
congress
had
in
mind
not
the
difference
between
a
jury
trial
case
and
a
nonjury
trial
case,
but
the
dichotomy
that,
as
was
referred
to
earlier,
exists
under
preiser
v.
rodriguez.
in
preiser
the
court
decided...
this
court
decided
that
there
was
a
clear
dichotomy
between
habeas
cases
on
the
one
hand
where
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
fact
or
duration
of
confinement
and
those
cases,
on
the
other
hand,
where
there
was
a
challenge
to
conditions
of
confinement.
and
the
court
did
cite,
not
only
haines
v.
kerner,
which
was
a
case
involving
solitary
confinement
and
a
claim
for
damages
arising
out
of
solitary
confinement,
but
also
the
wilberly
case,
which
was
a
challenge
to
prison
clothing.
so
the
court
clearly
had
in
mind
that
broad
distinction
and
so
did
congress,
because
that
was
the
kind
of
distinction
that
would
serve
its
aim
of
broadening
discretion,
broadening
the
discretion
of
congress
to...
of
the
court
to
refer
to
magistrates.
and
i
think
we
need
to
be
very
clear
about
what
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
to
refer
to
this
case
a
single
episode
case
involving
damages
only
is
simply
wrong.
throughout
this
case,
indeed
in
the
joint
appendix
incorporating
the
magistrate's
findings
at
paragraph
56
and
57,
there
is
a
clear
finding
by
the
magistrate
as
to
the
existence
of
directives,
pursuant
to
which
and
consistent
with,
which
action
here
was
taken
against
the
petitioner.
and
it
was
one
of
the
conditions
of
confinement,
as
the
second
circuit
concluded,
that
the
petitioner
would
be
subject
to--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--the
petitioner
in
this
case
very
much
cared
about
the
prison
directives.
indeed,
he
directly
challenged
them
in
every
complaint...
his
initial
complaint,
his
amended
complaint,
his
second
amended
complaint.
as
exhibits
2
and
3
before
the
magistrate,
he
offered
the
written
directives
which
he
sought
against
the
opposition
of
the
state
of
connecticut
through
an
foia
request.
so
he
was
very
intensely
interested
in
the
conditions
of
confinement
as
embodied
in
those
regulations,
justice
scalia.
and
that
is
very
much
a
matter
of
the
record
before
this
court.
underlying
the
second
circuit's
opinion
is
the
preiser
dichotomy,
and
we
have
to
assume
also
underlying
the
distinction
that
congress
drew
in
the
structure
of
this
statute
is
that
same
dichotomy.
because
congress,
when
it
wanted
to
limit
the
authority
of
magistrates
who
refer
certain
kinds
of
issues
or
matters,
clearly
did
so.
it
did
so
in
(b)(1)(a).
mr.
richard
blumenthal
it
is
referable
under
that
provision
of
the
act
that
is
provided
for
in
(b)(1)(b).
but
it
is
referred
to
separately
in
the
act,
and
clearly
embodied
in
the
structure
in
the
act
is
that
dichotomy
which
congress
saw
this
court
making.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
yes,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
congress
did
place
limits
in
(b)(1)(a)
on
the
kinds
of
matters
that
could
be
referred.
it
also,
when
it
wanted
to
refer
to
a
pattern
or
practice,
did
so
for
example
in
42
u.s.
code
1997.
it
referred
to
a
pattern
or
practice.
in
the
rico
statute,
it
referred
to
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
when
conditions
or
a
pattern
of
action
were
what
congress
sought
to
deal
with,
it
did
so
very
explicitly.
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute...
nothing
at
all...
nothing
in
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
mentions
single
episode
or
continuing,
pervasive,
ongoing
conditions
or
that
sets
up
that
kind
of
dichotomy.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
there
is
nothing,
justice
stevens,
that--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--well,
in
all
honesty,
the
legislative
history
is
pretty
much
silent
on
this--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--subject.
and
what
we
have
to
do...
what...
with
all
due
respect...
what
the
court
must
do
in
this
instance
is
look
to
what
the
purpose
of
congress
was
so
clearly,
which
was
to
give...
to
give
courts
maximum
discretion
in
referring
matters
to
magistrates.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
that
clearly--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
agree
that
it's
anomalous,
because
i
think
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
there
be
certain
nonconsensual
references.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
that
where
there
is
no
objection...
no
timely
demand
for
a
jury,
it's
perfectly
proper
under
(b)(1)(b)
for
there
to
be
a
reference
to
a
magistrate
by
the
district
judge.
the
statute
doesn't
draw
a
distinction,
doesn't
constrain
discretion
as
to
those
cases
that,
on
the
one
hand,
all
of
which
have
to
be
referred
to
one
place
or
the
other.
it
doesn't
say
all
single
episode
cases
have
to
be...
have
go
to
the
district
judge.
it
doesn't
say
that
all
damage
claims
have
to
go
to
a
district
judge.
the
congress
really
was
relying
on
the
sound
discretion
of
the
courts
to
protect
those
rights,
and
it
didn't
distinguish
either
between
important
cases
or
unimportant
cases,
between
big
cases
and
small
cases.
that
distinction
would
have
been
equally
blurred
and
difficult
to
apply.
in
protecting
those
seventh
amendment
rights,
the
petitioner
and
any
other
litigant
would
have
the
clear
right
to
demand
a
jury
and
thereby
avoid
reference
to
a
magistrate.
but
that
would
be
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
jury
trial,
not
to
give
the
petitioner
or
anyone
else
the
ability
to
choose
between
the...
between
one
judicial
officer
or
another,
and
thereby
in
effect
not
only
frame
his
complaint
but
make
the
decision
for
the
courts
as
to
which
of
those
judicial
officers
would
be
chosen.
this
is
a
case
i
think
that
illustrates
very
dramatically
the
difficulty
of
drawing
this
distinction
between
a
single
episode
on
one
hand
and
a
continuing
condition
on
the
other,
a
claim
for
damages
which
was
involved,
and
a
claim
for
injunctive
relief.
but
it
also
illustrates
well
the
fact
that
there
is
a
process
difficulty
with
drawing
that
distinction,
which
is
that
anywhere
along
the
line,
sui
sponte
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
as
happened
in
clark
v.
poulton,
this
distinction
could
be
raised.
and
it
would
be
according
to
this
court's
rulings,
and
according
to
the...
most
of
the
courts
below,
it
would
be
jurisdictional.
and
as
a
consequence,
if
it
were
successfully
raised
by
whatever
party
or
by
the
court
itself,
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
if
there
were
a
conclusion
that
the
distinction
was
erroneously
drawn.
and
it
would
begin
all
over
again.
what
would
happen
in
this
case
is
that
8
days'
worth
of
hearing
before
the
magistrate,
14
pages
of
docket
entries,
a
massive
case
even
though
it
seems
like
a
single
incidence
case,
a
simple
case
involving
damages.
not
so
at
all.
this
case
consumed
a
great
of
time
on
the
part
of
the
magistrate,
on
the
part
of
the
district
court.
and
there
are
reasons
of
it
relating
to
simply
the
excruciating
administrative
difficulty
that
would
arise
from
adopting
the
distinction
that
is
advanced
here
by
the
petitioner.
i
think
it's
also
illuminating
to
note
how
this
case
really
came
here
and
how
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
arose.
the
story
of
the
conflict
begins
with
judge
swygert's
concurring
opinion
in
hill
v.
jenkins.
hill
v.
jenkins
didn't
even
turn
on
this
issue.
it
involved
a
case
in
which
a
magistrate
had
failed
to
make
any
kind
of
findings
or
recommendations.
there
was
no
de
novo
review.
error
was
found
for
that
reason.
justice
swygert,
in
a
concurring
opinion,
beginning
with
the
word
"presumably"
and
then
saying
what
he
thought
this
distinction
was
between
single
episode
in
continuing
conditions
cases,
in
the
next
four
or
five
lines
advanced
the
distinction
without
any
citation
either
to
other
cases
or
legislative
history,
concluded
that
any
other
interpretation
would
be,
to
quote
his
concurring
opinion,
strained.
the
distinction
then
acquired
a
kind
of
life
of
its
own.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
1979
in
seventh
circuit.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
distinction
then
acquired,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
a
life
of
its
own.
it
was
cited
sometimes
in
decisions
that
really
didn't
involve
the
issue
at
all
on
both
sides.
at
this
point,
the
ninth,
tenth,
and
fourth
circuits
have
adopted
it,
the
fourth
circuit
being
somewhat
ambiguous
because
it
hasn't...
it
started
to
adopt
this
distinction
in
a
footnote
in
a
case
that
wimmer...
wimmer
case
that
didn't
really
involve
the
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
the
eighth
and
sixth
circuits,
along
with
the
second
circuit,
have
gone
the
other
way.
the
only
reasoned
analysis
of
this
distinction
and
of
the
merits
on
either
side
are
contained
in
the
clark
v.
poulton
opinion
for
the
majority,
in
which
there
is
a
very
strong
dissent
and
in
which
there
is
now
being
considered
a
petition
for
rehearing
with
a
suggestion
en
banc.
and
of
course,
the
opinion
of
judge
neumann
for
the
second
circuit
below.
we
contend
that
our
distinction,
which
is
drawn
clearly,
naturally,
logically...
the
distinction
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
is
one
that
serves
the
best...
the
true
goals
of
congress
in
this
statute.
a
goal
that
has
been
endorsed
and
articulated
by
this
court
in
united
states
v.
raddatz,
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
a
motion
for
suppression
hearing
could
be
referred
to
a
magistrate.
the
court
concluded
that
it
could,
that
there
did
not
have
to
be
a
new
hearing
before
the
district
judge,
and
that
is
was
the
district
judge
who
should
have
discretion
under
the
statute,
because
that
fit
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
of
congress
to
broaden
the
authority
of
magistrates,
to
ease
the
workload
of
the
district
judges,
consistent
with
seventh
amendment
rights,
because
the
prisoners
could
continue
to
demand
a
jury
trial
and
do
often.
but
that
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
district
judge
would
exist
whenever
and
wherever
there
were
no
timely
jury
demand.
i
would
just
conclude
by
citing
for
this
court
also
the
dissent
that
is
contained
in
the
clark
v.
poulton
case
when
judge
anderson,
which
i
think
strikingly
illustrates
the
incongruity
or
anomaly...
to
use
two
words
that
have
been
used
today...
of
the
petitioner's
approach.
a
single
beating
case
would
have
to
go
to
a
district
judge,
but
a
case
alleging
daily
beating
of
prisoners
would
go
inexorably
to
a
magistrate.
that
cannot
be
in
the
interest
of
anyone,
not
the
judiciary,
not
the
public,
not
even
perhaps
of
prisoners,
because
let's
remember
that
cases
would
have
to
be
referred
if
they
involved
a
single
episode
claim
for
damages,
under
petitioner's
theory,
even
where
the
prisoner
himself
or
herself
might
want
to
be
heard
by
the
magistrate
at
the
prison.
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
district
judges
would
go
out
to
the
prison,
but
there
would
be
great
advantages,
and
were
in
this
case,
to
having
cases
of
this
type
heard
at
the
prison
where
evidence
would
be
accessible,
documents
would
be
there,
and
the
difficulties
of
going
to
court
and
having
that
same
accessibility
would
be
avoided.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
indeed,
justice
marshall,
the
interestingly...
the
[inaudible]
initially
offered
by
the
petitioner
here
was
$100,000
in
damages,
injunctive
relief
against
the
directives,
and
get
me
out
of
prison.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
well,
the
second
circuit
concluded,
and
of
course
we
agree,
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
language
of
preiser
even
though
preiser
is
not
cited
in
the
legislative
history,
and
perhaps
it
had
not
yet
become
a
term
of
art.
but
conditions
of
confinement,
in
the
context
of
prison
life,
in
the
context
of
being
confined,
very
arguably
extends
to
anything
that
happens
while
that
person
is
subject
to
the
guard
and
care
of
the
confining
official.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
we...
we--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
definition
contained
in
the
dictionary,
the...
some
historical
references
and
uses
of
the
term
"petition"
to
describe
actions
that
may
not
involve
equitable
relief.
but
it
would
have
been
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
meant
to
circumscribe
and
cut
out
an
entire
class
of
action.
and
indeed,
petitioner
concedes
that
the
fit
is
not
perfect
without
very
clearly
indicating
its
intent
to
do
so.
and
the
concessions
that
petitioner
makes
in
footnotes
3
and
footnote
9
very
considerably
eviscerate
whatever
argument
could
have
been
made
on
the
basis
of
the
distinction
between
equitable
relief
on
the
one
hand
and
damages
relief
on
the
other
hand.
the
petitioner
concedes
in
those
footnotes
that
ancillary
claims
for
damages,
as
he
refers
to
them,
can
be
referred
to
the
magistrate
when
they
involve
injunctive
relief.
and
what
is
ancillary
in
one
jurist's
view
may
be
very
different
from
what
it
is
in
another
jurist's
view.
and
in
footnote
9
mentions
the
instance
of
a
single
petitioner
who
was
deprived...
allegedly
deprived
of
constitutionally
satisfactory
meals
as
opposed
to
pervasive
conditions.
that
distinction
again
seems
to
be
breaking
down.
so
we
would
contend
that
as
opposed
to
the...
the
distinction
offered
by
petitioner
which
is
novel,
imported,
and
really
unworkable,
that
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
is
a
natural,
logical,
reasonable
one,
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
this
statute
and
with
the
seventh
amendment
and
other
statutory
provisions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
concludes
my
argument.
