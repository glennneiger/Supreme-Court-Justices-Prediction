justice
kennedy
suppose
the
prisoner
alleges
that
if
the
officials
will
not...
are
not
enjoined,
it
is
likely
the
conduct
will
be
repeated.
does
that
turn
it
into
a
conditions
of
confinement
case?
justice
kennedy
but
don't
you
almost
always
have
to
allege
that
if
you're
going
to
ask
for
an
injunction?
justice
kennedy
i
suppose
this
is
a...
quite
a
routine
and
frequent
allegation
in
order
to
support
the
claim
for
injunctive
relief,
is
it
not?
justice
kennedy
and
i...
and
i
assume
you
have
to
make
some
such
allegation
if
you're
going
to
ask
for
injunctive
relief.
justice
kennedy
but
if
that's
what--
--it
might
turn
in
to
be
a
conditions
case
in
any
event,
because
if
the
prison
lost
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
i'm
sure
it
would
be
collateral
estoppel.
and
so
it
becomes
a
conditions
case
anyway.
