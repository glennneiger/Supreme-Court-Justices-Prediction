mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
an
inmate
in
a
connecticut
prison,
petitioner
was
sprayed
with
tear
gas
and
forcibly
removed
from
his
cell.
on
the
basis
of
that
single
episode,
he
filed
a
1983
action
against
respondents,
who
are
various
officials
and
guards
at
the
facility.
the
case
was
referred
to
a
federal
magistrate,
who
conducted
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
on
that
basis
recommended
that
the
case
be
resolved
against
petitioner.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
he
sought
both
damages
and
injunctive
relief,
justice
white.
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
reference
was
proper.
in
other
words,
whether
a
complaint
based
on
a
single
episode
of
unconstitional...
unconstitutionally
excessive
force
qualifies
as
a,
quote,
"prisoner
petition
challenging
conditions
of
confinement.
"
within
the
meaning
of
section
636(b)
of
the
federal
magistrate's
act,
and
is
thereby
subject
to
reference
without
the
party's
consent.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
that
issue
is
not
before
the
case...
before
the
court,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
that
is
correct.
now,
i
don't
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
jury
right
here
is
relevant
to
the
argument
we
make
under
the
seventh
amendment.
and
perhaps
i
should
address
that.
we
think,
as
an
initial
matter,
that
by
far
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statutory
language
is
to
construe
the
phrase
"prisoner
petitions
challenging
conditions
of
confinement.
"
to
refer
to
ongoing
circumstances
or
practices,
as
distinct
from
a
fully
consummated,
isolated
event.
we
think
that
conforms
with
common
usage,
with
this
court's
use
of
the
phrase,
and
with
the
use
of
the
phrase
by
congress
in
various
other
statutes.
whatever
the
outer
limits
of
the
definition
may
be,
we
think
it
strains
the
common
meaning
beyond
the
breaking
point
to
suggest
that
a
guard,
by
virtue
of
beating
one
prisoner
on
one
occasion,
thereby
creates
conditions
of
confinement.
but
moving
to
your
seventh
amendment
question,
justice
o'connor,
in
this
case
respondent
has
conceded
that
the
magistrate
is
not
empowered
to
conduct
a
jury
trial
at
all
in
cases
referred
under
the
prisoner
petitions
clause,
indeed
in
any
case
referred
without
the
consent
of
the
parties.
at
the
same
time,
cases...
because
of
the
rules
governing
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief,
cases
based
on
a
simple,
fully
consummated
episode,
tend
to
be
simple
damages
actions
for
which
the
party
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment.
now,
in
light
of
respondent's
concession,
we
think
it
is
just
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
authorize
the
nonconsensual
referral
of
an
entire
class
of
cases
for
which
the
jury
trial
rights
so
clearly
attaches.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i...
that
is
correct.
and
respondent's
position
on
this,
of
course,
is
that
congress
wrote
a
statute
by
which
prisoners
are
told
that
entirely
against
their
will
they
may
have
a
case
referred
for
trial
before
a
magistrate,
never
bothered
to
mention
that
they
could
entirely
avoid
the
reference
simply
by
timely
invocation
of
a
jury
trial
right.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
question
that
that
was
how
congress
wanted
it
to
work.
i
think
that
congress
chose
the
phrase
"conditions
of
confinement"
for
a
reason.
it
didn't
say,
all
prisoner
petitions.
it's...
it
used
what
amounts
to
a
term
of
art.
now,
what
respondents
are
trying
to
sell
here
is
the
notion
that
all
prisoner
cases
are
governed
under
the
case,
and
we...
are
governed
under
the
clause.
and
we
think
that's
unlikely
in
light
of
the
backgrounds
and
with
amendment
concerns.
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
not
asserting
an
independent
seventh
amendment
claim
here.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that,
as
an
interpretive
device,
the
seventh
amendment
is
quite
useful.
and
we
think
that
the
appropriate
test
here
is
that
to
the
extent
that
a
complaint,
not
at
the
time
that
a
complaint
is
filed,
but
at
the
time
that
the
case
is
actually
set
for
trial,
seeks
and
is
appropriate
for
injunctive
relief.
in
other
words,
it
challenges
an
ongoing
or
recurrent
circumstance
or
practice
that
in
fact
is
a
petition
challenging
conditions
of
confinement.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
only
complaint
at
the
time
that
the
case
gets
to
the
point
of
trial
is
that
an
isolated
event
occurred,
essentially
a
constitutional
tort.
i
don't
think
that
does
qualify
under
the
language.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
suppose
one
can
waive
it,
justice
marshall,
in
the
following
sense.
under
section
636(c),
one
can
consent
in
any
event
the
trial
before
a
magistrate.
there
was
no
consent
here,
at
least
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
that's
the...
congress
deemed
that
consent
rather
than
a
waiver,
but
in
effect
it
has
the
same...
it
has
same
consequences.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
right
can't
be
waived.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
that
congress
wrote
a
statute
that
says
independent
of
the
choice
of
litigants,
it
may
be
referred
to
magistrates
entirely
against
their
will.
and
again,
we
think
that
that
is
a
rather
unlikely
thing
for
it
to
have
done,
given
that
magistrates,
as
all
parties
before
the
court
now
concede,
take
the
position
that
magistrates
are
not
empowered
to
conduct
a
jury
trial.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
respondents
make
the...
very
much
the
same
argument,
as
did
the
court
below.
and
quite
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
rests
on
some
questionable
premises.
i...
i
don't
think
it
could
be
said
that
as
a
class,
cases
that
qualify
as
conditions
cases
are
more
serious
than
cases
based
on
a
single,
isolated
episode.
it's
always
difficult
of
course
to
rank
constitutional
violations.
but
to
suggest
that
a
claim
in
which
a
prisoner
was
beaten
to
death
is
somehow
less
serious
than
even
a
broad
based
class
action
seems
to
me
not
to
be...
not
surprising.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
think
in
fact
the
incongruity
implicit
in
the
question
is
somewhat
overstated.
for
example,
we're
not
saying
that
only
class
actions
qualify
under
our
definition.
not
at
all.
and
in
addition,
congress
authorized
the
referral
of
all
cases,
including
those
based
on
specific
episodes
of
misconduct
under
pretrial
and
the
dispositive
motions
provisions
of
the
act.
and
historically,
96
percent
in
1990
of...
of
prisoner
civil
rights
cases
are
disposed
of
even
before
trial.
i
think
that
suggests,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
a
high
level
of
confidence
in
magistrates'
ability
to
handle
all
kinds
of
cases
of
all
levels
of
complexity.
in
addition--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i
would
say
quite
frankly,
justice
scalia,
that
that
is
the
most
difficult
category
of
cases
to
get...
to
categorize,
wherein
you
have
what
i
suppose
could
be
described
as
a
past
conditions
case
under
any
sort
of
conventional
understanding
of
the
phrase--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--well,
i'm
saying
that
as
you
posited
the
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
there
was
a
condition
of
confinement
in
the
conventional
sense
of
the
word
in
that
for
a
period
of
time
one
was
exposed
to
an
unconstitutional
circumstance.
under
your
hypothetical,
however,
that
circumstance
has
abated
and
everybody
agrees
to
that.
i
think
frankly
i
found
no
such
cases
in
the
reported
cases.
i
suspect
that's
in
part
because
damages
actions
such
as
those
may
very
often
shake
out
in
qualified
immunity
grounds.
given
the
rarity
of
the
case,
i
think
all
that
would
be
needed
is
a
rule,
and
i
would
err
on
the
side
of
administrability
and
say
that
the
cleanest
line
here...
and
again
congress
required
that
some
line
be
drawn...
the
cleanest
line
here
would
be
to
say
that
complaints
that
at
the
time
of
trial
seek
to
have
tried
an
issue
that
there's
an
ongoing
or
at
least
recurrent
circumstance,
would
qualify
under
conditions
of
confinement.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
don't--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--it
may
be
a
clean
line,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
it's
the
line
that
congress
drew.
and
indeed
i
think
that
goes
to
the...
to
the
very
nub
of
the
case
here.
congress
simply
didn't
write
a
statute
that
said,
all
prisoner
litigation
may
be
referred
to
magistrates.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
let
me
try
to
address
both
of
those
points,
justice
o'connor.
as
to
preiser,
there's
certainly
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
even
aware
of
the
preiser
case,
much
less
that
it
patterned
the
statute
after
it.
much
less,
as
i
recall
in
the
case,
what
was
at
issue
there
was
whether
a
prisoner
who
was
challenging
the
deprivation
of
good
time
credits
could
escape
the
exhaustion
requirements
of
habeas
by
filing
the
suit
under
1983.
and
congress...
and
the
court
held
that
to
the
extent
the
challenge
was
to
the
fact
or
duration
of
confinement,
exhaustion
was
required.
to
the
extent
it
went
to
conditions
of
confinement,
habeas...
one
could
bring
the
claim
under
1983.
but
because
the
case
so
clearly
fell
in
the
first
category,
the
court
had
no
occasion
to
actually
define
what
it
meant
by
conditions
of
confinement.
and
indeed
it
the
court
goes
back
and
reviews
the
cases
cited
as
examples
in
the
preiser
decision
of
so-called
conditions
case,
i
think
it
will
find
that
all
of
them,
at
least
arguably,
fall
within
the
definition
that
we
propose
here.
in
one
sense
or
another,
they
concerned
an
ongoing
circumstance
or
practice.
the
most
difficult
case
for
us
is
the
hainey
case.
i
will
concede
that,
but
i
think
at
least
arguably
falls
in
our...
in
our
category.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
think
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
in...
in
that
case,
as
in
any--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--well,
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that,
again,
the
issue
is
not
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint,
because
the
decision
is
not
made
at
that
point.
but
after
the
completion
of
pretrial
proceedings
that
clarified
and
refined
the
issue
that
must
actually
be
tried
and
the
issue
is
actually
set
out,
then,
if
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff
has
set
out
the
essential
predicates
of
injunctive
relief,
and
as
he
suggests
they
are,
that
there
is
an
ongoing
circumstance
or
a
reasonable
likelihood
they
will
recur,
i
believe
that
then
in
fact
is
a
challenge
to
conditions
of
confinement.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
it
is
a
routine
allegation.
there
are
many,
many
cases.
whitley
v.
albers
is
the
classic
paradigmatic
example
where
only
damages
was
sought.
and
again,
that
would
not
qualify
as
a
conditions
case
under--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--you
would
need
to
indeed.
these
are
often
pro
se
complaints,
and
i
think
that
some
benefit
of
the
doubt
may
be
given
to
the
claimant
in
many
of
these
cases,
but
again
an
injunction
was...
an
injunction
was
asked
for
here.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
controlling
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
conditions
case,
because
at
the
time
that
this
case
went
to
trial
as
a
result
of
the
various
pretrial
proceedings,
which
again
are
conducted
by
the
magistrate,
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
there
was
no
injunctive
claim
left
in
the
case.
indeed,
the
assistant
attorney
general
had
argued
unequivocally
on
pretrial
motions
that,
quote,
"it
does
not
appear
how
any
injunctive
relief
would
be
appropriate
to
this
case.
"
there
have
been
an
effort
to
admit
the
various
prison
regulations.
the
petitioner
had
made
that
effort
on
the
eve
of
trial,
and
the
magistrate
had
kept
them
out
on
the
view
that
this
case
was
about
a
single
incident
back
in
1983.
so,
again,
just
to
make
sure
our
position
is
clear
on
this,
justice
kennedy,
it's
not
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
are
controlling.
it
is
what
is
the
issue
that
must
actually
be
tried.
by
the
way,
that
is
a
judgment
that
would
need
to
be
made
in
any
event.
in
any
case
on
the
eve
of
trial
there
must
be
some
kind
of
pretrial
decision
as
to
what
issues
must
actually
be
tried.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
well--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i...
that...
that's
not
our
position,
justice
souter.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
think
that
would
not
be
the
consequence,
and
if
i...
if
i
might
try
to
explain
that.
because
of
background
seventh
amendment
concerns,
we
do
think
that
the
prisoner
petitions
clause
is
a
rough
proxy
for
cases
that
seek
and
are
appropriate
for
injunctive
relief.
at
the
same
time,
it
is
not
a
perfect
fit.
for
reasons
discussed
previously,
if
someone
includes
an
injunctive
claim
in
what
is
otherwise...
what
ought
properly
to
be
a
damages
suit...
we
think
the
appropriate
path
is
to
have
the
injunctive
claim
dismissed
prior
to
trial
and
to
treat
it
as
a
specific
episodes
case.
and
conversely,
to
get
to
your
example,
if
somebody
brings
a
case
that
is
a
classic
conditions
suit
or
is
a
conditions
suit
under
our
definition
and
includes
an
associated
damages
claim,
i
do
think
that
nonetheless
qualifies
as
a
prisoner
petition
challenging
conditions
of
confinement
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
i
don't
think,
however,
that
any
imperfections
in
the
fit
undermine
the
basic
point.
and
that
basic
point
is
it
is
simply
implausible
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
even
authorized
the
referral
of
an
entire
class
of
cases
for...
to
which
the
right
so
clearly
attaches
without
mading...
making
some
provision
for
the
magistrate
to
actually
conduct
a
jury
trial.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
well,
the
good
of
it--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i...
again,
i...
let
me
be
clear.
if
there
is
a
damages
claim
and
no
jury
trial
right,
and
the
damages
claim
is
attached
to
or
associated
with
a
conditions
claim,
we
think
the
magistrate
can
hear
the
case.
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
a
moment
ago.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
i
think
that
in
a
sense
you
have
a
result
that's
driven
by
the
statutory
language.
you
have
a
statute
that
says
conditions
of
confinement,
and
if
you
have
a
case
challenging
what
everybody
would
agree
to
be
conditions
of
confinement...
for
example,
petitioners
generally
are
not
being
given
enough
food
and
a
subclass
of
the
class
action
alleges
that
as
a
result
of
the
inadequate
caloric
intake
they
are...
have
suffered
some
damages
for
which
they
want
compensation...
i
think
that
the
language
drives
that
result.
and
i
think
that
would
qualify
as
a
prisoner
petitions
case.
again,
if
there
is
a
time
of
jury
trial
demand,
then
either
severance
would
be
the...
mandated
by
the
constitution
or
the
whole
case
would
be
tried...
tried
by
the
judge.
but
that's
the
imperfection
of
the
fit
i
was
trying
to
address
before.
i--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--that's
the
position
we
took
in
our
reply
brief,
justice
scalia.
i
do
want
to
make
one
point
in
response
to
an
argument
raised
by
respondents.
they
suggest
that
rather
cataclysmic
results
will...
will
flow
from
the
issue
before
the
court
today.
and
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
my
estimation
that
is
not...
not
right.
all
cases
of
any
stripes...
specific
episode
cases
or
conditions
cases...
may
still
be
referred
to
the
magistrates,
and
the
vast
majority
of
such
cases
shake
out
before
trial.
indeed,
in
1990,
about
4
percent
of
cases
actually
needed
to
be
tried.
of
those,
many
of
course
may
be
tried
pursuant
to
the
consent
of
the
parties.
still
others
will
satisfy
our
definition.
and
still
others
must
be
tried
by
the
district
court
in
any
event
to
the
extent
there
is
a
timely
jury
trial
demand.
as
a...
as
a
practical
matter,
the
number
of
cases
actually
affected
by
the
decision
today
is
relatively
small.
but
in
any
event,
i
just
don't
think
it's
correct
to
suggest
that
any
interpretation
that
results
in
more
cases
being
referred
to
federal
magistrates
is
necessarily
in
accordance
with
congress'
broad
objectives.
in
expanding
the
power
of
federal
magistrates
over
the
years,
congress
has
been
quite
aware
of
the
constitutional
concerns
associated
with
such
delegations
and
has
been
appropriately
cautious.
in
our
estimation,
our
view
better
accommodates
both
that
historic
caution
and
congress'
general
objective
of
expanding
the
power
of
magistrates
in
some,
but
by
not
means
all,
classes
of
cases.
in
the
end,
this
is
a
relatively
straightforward
statutory
case.
we
think
that
the
plain
language
at
the
very
least
tips
in
our
favor,
and
accordingly
it
is
respondents'
burden
and
not--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--sure.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
yes,
i
do.
and
i...
let
me
try
to
recall
what
those
cases
were.
but
the
cooper
v.
pate
case,
for
example,
was
a
claim
that
a
petitioner
had
been
deprived
of
the
koran,
and
as
i
read
the
decisions
in
the
lower
courts,
the
claim
was
he
was
still
being
deprived
of
it,
and
therefore,
there
was
sort
of
an
ongoing
claim
for
which
an
injunction
seems
to
be
quite
an
appropriate
remedy.
as
i
recall
the--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--that
is
my
claim,
unless,
of
course...
and
this
is
a
judgment
that
would
need
to
be
made
in
any
case...
unless
of
course
he
had
satisfied
the
city
of
los
angeles
v.
lyons
test
of
indicating
some
real
and
immediate
threat
that
he
would--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--again
be
exposed
to
that
unconstitutional
conduct.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
if
there's
a
rule
that's
saying
when
a
prisoner
refuses
to
leave
the
cell,
then
it's
appropriate?
again,
a
judgment
would
need
to
be
made
in
that
case
as
to
whether
there
was
some
reasonable
likelihood
that
that
regulation
would
be
applied
to
the
person
who...
who
was
bringing
the
case.
and
i...
i
do
want
to
suggest--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--it
probably
would
in
this
sense,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
city
of
los
angeles
test
is
going
to
be
applied
more
generously
in
the
prison
context.
when
you're
talking
about
the
citizens
in
a
city
at
large,
it's
somewhat
difficult
to
actually
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
a
real
likelihood
that
one
will
again
be
exposed
to
even
an
ongoing
regulation,
policy,
or
practice.
if
you
have
a
regulation
in
a
prison
context,
one
can
think
of
extreme
examples.
but
in
the
typical
case,
a
prisoner,
not
being
able
to
leave
of
course,
has
some
relatively
high
likelihood
he
or
she
will
be
exposed
to
that
regulation
and
application.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
no.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
not
at
all.
no.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
what
i
am
suggesting
is
one
needs
to
take
in...
take
into
account
what
is
being
challenged
and
the
nature
of
the
relief
and
the
nature
of
the
claim.
all
of
those
are--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--well,
to
a
degree
that
true
of
any
litigant
i
would
think,
justice
scalia.
one
can...
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
that
happened
not
to
be
a
class
action.
i
believe
that
damages,
at
least
as
the
case
came
to
the
court,
were
not
at
issue.
one
structures
one's
complaint
to
get
the
relief
that
one
wants.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--i
suspect
that
would
be...
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical...
that
would
be
a
conditions
case.
i
mean,
i
think
the
judgment
there
would
be
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
that
practice
is
going
to
be
applied
to
this
prisoner.
and
i
would
think
it
almost
inescapable
that
it
would
be.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
well,
if
he's...
if
he's...
let
me
be
absolutely
clear.
if
he's
only
seeking
damage--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--he
said
for
4
days
i
had...
i
had
a
toothache
and
i
suffered
terrible
pain
and
i
want
compensation
for
that,
and
that's
all
he
asking
for,
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
conditions
case.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
that's...
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
that's
the
line
that
i
would--
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
--well,
i
don't
suggest
that
it's
only
a
matter
of
pleading,
justice
souter.
i
must
however
take
the
position
that
pleading
is
relevant
to
the
analysis,
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
any
litigant.
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
it
may
become
that.
i
think
that
the
key
point
in
time
here
is
at
the
time
that
the
decision
must
be
made,
that
is,
when
the
case
is
about
to
go
to
trial.
at
that
point,
the
magistrate
has
a
clear
sense
of
what
the
issues
are
to
be
tried.
now,
if
at
that
point
he
understands
the
defense
is
being
raised
and
the
complaint...
what's
left
of
the
complaint
after
pretrial
motions
practice
if
in
fact
the
challenge
is
to
an
ongoing
or
recurrent
circumstances,
then
i
think
that
is
a
challenge
to
conditions
of
confinement.
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
christopher
d.
cerf
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
no
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
kindly.
