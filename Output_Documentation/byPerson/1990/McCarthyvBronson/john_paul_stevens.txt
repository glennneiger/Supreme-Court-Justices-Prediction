--mr.
cerf,
can
i...
can
i
ask
you
a
couple
more
questions
about
your
line?
justice
stevens
i
know
this
was
raised
in
justice
scalia's
question
so...
the
specific
cases
referred
to
in
preiser,
do
you
say
each
of
them,
except
arguably
haines,
was
a
case
that
would
meet
the
conditions
of
confinement
definition:
the
deprival
of
legal
materials
for
the
particular
petition,
the
inability
to...
with
the
one
religious
objection
in
the
other
case?
justice
stevens
and
your
line
is
that
if
he'd
complained
of
having
been
deprived
of
it
6
months
ago,
but
then
he
eventually
got
it,
it
would
not
longer
be
a
conditions
of
confinement
claim?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
and
conversely,
in
the
case
before
us,
if
the
prison
had
a
rule
that
said
when
prisoners
refuse
to
cell,
it's
appropriate
to
use
tear
gas
to
get
them
out
of
their
cells.
which
is
it
then?
justice
stevens
well,
it
had
been
applied,
as
it
has
here.
i
mean...
see
the
thing
that's
different
about
this
case
is
there's
no
such
rule.
but
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
there
were
a
rule
and
it
had
been
applied
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
well,
but
mr....
let
me
go
a
step
further.
supposing
the
complaint
is
i
had
inadequate
dental
care.
i
had
a
tooth
ache
on
friday
and
i
couldn't
get
a
dentist.
and
that's
the
sole
charge,
a
single
incident.
and
the
defense
is
we
have
a
regulation
that
the
dentist
is
available
on
monday,
tuesday,
and
wednesday
only...
something
like...
so
the
real
issue
turns
into
the
regulation.
is
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
or
isolated
incident?
justice
stevens
but
he
doesn't
really
care
about
he
rule.
all
he
cares
about
his
own
toothache.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
even
though
the
defense
is
the
reason
he
didn't
get
it
is
because
we
have
this
standard
regulation
that
this
is
the
way
we
treat
all
prisoners.
they
don't
get
the
dentist
except
on
certain
days.
justice
stevens
but
on
the
other
hand,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
mentions
preiser?
justice
stevens
really
the
legislative
history
is
kind
of
a
draw
i
guess,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
maximum
but
really
not
unlimited
either.
there
are
limits
on
it.
let
me
ask
you
this
about
the
jury
trial.
i
don't
understand
your
opponent
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right.
what
he's
saying
is
it's
somewhat
anomalous
to
say
that
in
order
to
avoid
a
reference
to
a
magistrate
that
the
prisoner
must
make
a
jury
trial.
so
that
unlike
a
lot...
if
the
reference
is
impermissible
without
consent,
he
could
normally
get
the
trial
before
the
judge.
but
he
doesn't
have
that...
there
are
three
alternatives,
the
magistrate,
the
judge,
or
the
jury.
he
can
avoid
the
magistrate
by
insisting
on
the
jury,
but
there's
no
way
in
which
he
can
be
sure
that
he
can
avoid
a
magistrate
without
making
that
demand.
justice
stevens
which
is
kind
of
anomalous.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
judge
hastings
used
to
refer
to
that
as
the
holiday
in
court...
rightful
holiday
in
court.
[laughter]
general,
what
you...
you
know
what
you
say
about
the
practicalities
may
be
true.
congress
surely
could
have
picked
better
language
to
do
what
you...
what
you
say
it's
done.
i
mean
the
phrase
"petitions
challenging
conditions
of
employment",
one
doesn't
refer
to...
you
know
if
there's
an
automobile
accident
and
somebody
sues
for
damages,
you
don't
say
that...
that
i
am
challenging
the
other
person's
driving
of
a
car.
a
petition
challenging
something
really
does
call
to
mind
a
request
for
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief.
when
you're
suing
for
money,
i
don't
know
that
you
say
you're
challenging
something.
very
strange
terminology
for
what
you
have
in
mind
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
mccarthy
against
bronson.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
prisoner
who
brought
suit
against
various
state
prison
officials
alleging
that
they
violated
his
constitutional
rights
by
using
excessive
force
when
transferring
him
from
one
cell
to
another.
over
petitionerâ€™s
objection,
the
case
was
referred
to
a
magistrate
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
prepare
proposed
findings
effect
and
conclusions
of
law.
a
federal
statute
authorizes
the
nonconsensual
referral
to
a
magistrate
of
prisoner
petitions
challenging
conditions
of
confinement.
thus,
the
question
is
whether
an
allegation
of
a
single
episode
of
unconstitutional
conduct
by
prison
officials
is
covered
by
that
language,
or
whether
the
language
instead
includes
only
challenges
to
ongoing
prison
conditions.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
that
both
types
of
cases
may
be
referred
to
a
magistrate.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
thus,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
