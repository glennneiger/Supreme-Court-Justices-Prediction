justice
o'connor
mr.
cerf,
do
we
take
the
case
with
the
agreement
of
both
parties
that
the
defendant
waived
jury
trial
here?
justice
o'connor
so
we
decide
it
as
though
there
was
a
waiver?
justice
o'connor
well,
but,
mr.
cerf,
in
the
case
of
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
this
court
talked
about
the
term
"conditions
of
confinement"
and
gave
some
examples
there
that
looked
very
much
like
this
kind
of
case,
and
said
that
was
a
matter
of
a
condition
of
confinement.
and
i
suppose
that
congress
had
in
mind
trying
to
alleviate
the
administrative...
or
the
burdens
on
the
lower
courts
of
handling
prisoner
petitions
and
letting
as
many
of
them
go
to
a
magistrate
as
possible.
and
it
would
appear
that
under
preiser
we
could
give
a
broader
interpretation
of
the
term
"conditions
of
confinement".
