justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-5635,
john
j.
mccarthy,
petitioner,
versus
george
bronson.
mr.
cerf.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
prevent
that
by
demanding
a
jury
trial,
can't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
respondent
is
right,
it
worked
the
way
congress
wanted
it
to.
your
client
had
his
case
referred
to
a
magistrate.
he
could
have
prevented
the
referral
by
demanding
a
jury
trial.
he
didn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's
a
certain
incongruity
it
seems
to
me
in...
in
your
interpretation.
perhaps
it's
not
an
incongruity,
but
it
seems
strange
at
first
blush.
and
that
is
that
what
you
call
a
simple
damages
action
based
on
a
one-time
thing
would
go
to
the
district
judge.
and
a
major
prison
structure
claim
that
things
are
all
out
of
whack
at
the
prison,
could
go
to
the
magistrate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
not
so
much
the
seriousness
of
the
event,
but
the
amount
of
discretion
that's
called
for.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
were
going
to
allot
these
cases
by
the
confidence
in
the
judgment...
presumably
you
have
more
confidence
in
the
judgment
of
a
district
judge
than
of
a
magistrate...
you
would
say
that
if
you're
trying
to
restructure
a
court...
a
prison
system,
that
kind
of
a
case
you'd
trust
to
the
discretion
of
a
district
judge,
whereas
you
might
not
trust
it
to
the
discretion
of
a
magistrate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
cerf.
general
blumenthal,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
blumenthal,
if...
taking
the
preiser
dichotomy
for
a
moment...
if
a
plaintiff
has
a
habeas
claim,
wanting
to
shorten
his
time
in
jail...
get
out
of
jail,
that
is
referable
to
a
magistrate
by
a
separate
provision
of
the
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
under...
under
your
interpretation
both
sides
of
the
preiser
against
rodriguez
types
of
complaints
are
referable
to
magistrates,
albeit
by
two
different
provisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
what
year
was
that
do
you
remember,
mr....
general
blumenthal?
roughly
how
long
ago?
1979.
'79.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
blumenthal.
mr.
cerf,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
