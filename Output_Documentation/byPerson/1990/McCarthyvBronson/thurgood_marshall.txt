if
you
can
waive
a
trial
and
you
can
waive
a
jury,
why
can't
you
waive
this?
justice
marshall
so
what
do
you
interpret
from
that,
a
waiver?
justice
marshall
what's
so
sacred
about
this
that
you
can't
waive
it?

general
blumenthal--
--i
don't
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
but
the
average
prisoner
would
rather
get
out
of
prison
than
to
have
the
case
tried
there.
