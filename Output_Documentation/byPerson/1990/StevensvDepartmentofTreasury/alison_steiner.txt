ms.
alison
steiner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
charles
stevens,
a
67-year-old
employee
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
before
this
court
today,
asking
it
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
dismissing
his
age
discrimination
and
employment
case
and
to
remand
this
case
for
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
federal
district
court.
the
respondent
agrees
that
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
entitles
petitioner
to
this
relief.
section
15(c)
of
the
adea
gives
federal
employees
the
right
to
file
civil
actions
in
federal
district
court
to
remedy
age
discrimination
in
their
employment.
the
parties
agree
that
the
only
statutory
precondition
to
this
is
that
the
employee
must,
under
section
15(d),
give
not
less
than
30
days'
notice
of
his
intent
to
sue
before
filing
suit,
and
must
give
that
notice
within
180
days
of
the
allegedly
discriminatory
event.
it
is
undisputed
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
both
of
these
things.
the
court
before
however
held
incorrectly
that
suit
had
to
be
filed
within
30
days
of
the
notice,
and
therefore,
dismissed
the
petitioner's
suit
as
being
filed
too
long
after
his
notice.
this
error
was
urged
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
government
who
is
charged
with
the
statute's
enforcement
and
has
caused
some
confusion
in
courts
throughout
the
country
which
have
made
similar
though
not
identical
errors.
ms.
alison
steiner
it
was
not
argued
in
the
body
of
the
brief.
it
was
subsumed
within
the
question
presented,
and
the
respondent
argued
it
at
some
length
in
its
brief.
ms.
alison
steiner
the
question
presented
stated
that
if
an
aggrieved
party
fails
to
file
an
administrative
age
discrimination
complaint
in
the
time
frame
of
the
general
administrative
provision
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission...
the
commission...
does
such
failure
deprive
a
federal
district
court
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
civil
action
filed
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
where
a
charge
has
been
timely
filed
there
under.
he
was
alleging
that
he
had
timely
filed
his
15(d)
charge
in
that
question.
he
did
not,
however,
argue
that
in
the
body
of
his
brief.
the
court
did,
however,
decide
this
question
and
dismissed
his
suit,
although
it
found
that
the
notice
under
15(d)
was
timely
as...
in
relation
to
the
allegedly
discriminatory
act.
it
concluded
that
the
suit
was
untimely
as
having
been
filed
7
months
after
the
notice.
it
adopted
in
that
respect
a
specific
holding
of
the
district
court
that
the...
that
the
suit
had
to
be
filed
within
30
days.
there's
a
second
question
that
arises
in
this
case,
and
it
has
to
do
with
a
separate
section
of
the
act,
section
15(b),
which
creates
an
administrative
process
to
which
federal
employees
may
also
turn
if
they
wish.
the
parties
here
today
agree
that
this
separate
administrative
process
is
not
a
statutory
precondition
to
15(c)
jurisdiction.
and
a
federal
employee's
efforts
in
the
administrative
arena--
ms.
alison
steiner
--the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
both
decided
that
issue
and
concluded
that
this
petitioner's
tardiness
in
the
administrative
arena
provided
a
separate
ground
for
the
dismissal
of
his
lawsuit.
they
ruled
on
both
questions.
ms.
alison
steiner
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
district
court's
ruling
when
it
affirmed
the
holding
that
the
administrative
tardiness
mandated
dismissal.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
alludes
to
both
rulings.
and--
ms.
alison
steiner
--that
is
the
ground
that
is
cited
at
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
it
also,
in
the
body
of
its
opinion,
makes
the
specific
finding
that
the
district
court
determined
that
the
administrative
filing
was
not
timely
and
affirmed
that
finding.
a...
very
shortly
after
this
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
also
made
circuit
precedence
that
it
would
invoke...
would
require
exhaustion
of
remedies
in
the
case
of
white
v.
frank.
so
there
is
no
question
that
circuit
precedence
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
to
that
effect
and
that
it
conflicts
directly
with
circuit
precedent
in,
among
other
circuits
the
sixth,
in
the
langford
case.
ms.
alison
steiner
no,
your
honor.
ms.
alison
steiner
yes.
ms.
alison
steiner
it
agrees--
ms.
alison
steiner
--i...
well,
the
government
agrees
that...
that
there
should
be
no
exhaustion--
ms.
alison
steiner
--and
that
this
case
was
timely
filed.
it
is
undisputed,
of
course,
that
the
petitioner
attempted
to
press
his
claim
in
the
15(b)
administrative
arena
but
was
denied
the
right
to
do
so
because
he
started
that
too
late.
and
we
do
not
dispute
that.
the
court
below,
in
affirming
the
district
court,
erroneously
found
a
linkage
between
the
petitioner's
tardiness
and
the...
and
its
right
to
dismiss
the
suit,
and
thus
construed
his
time
default
in
the
administrative
arena
as
a
failure
to
exhaust
the
remedies
which
supported
its
dismissal
of
the
suit.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
district
court,
argued
at
some
length
by
the
respondent
taking
the
opposite
position
that
it
is
taking
here
today,
and
decided...
and
even
conceded
by
respondent
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari
as
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
it
is
the
subject
of
a
clear
conflict
among
the
circuits
desperately
needing
resolution.
and
i
believe
it
would
be
necessary
to
ensure
in
this
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
simply
reiterate
the
failure
in
the
administrative
arena
as
grounds
for
affirming
the
dismissal
since
it
has
already
ruled
that
the
untimeliness
was,
to
some
degree,
linked.
the
timeliness
question,
almost
to
state
it,
resolves
it.
the
statute,
section
15(d),
contains
two
deadlines.
first,
that
within
180
days
of
the
discrimination,
the
aggrieved
employee
must
give
notice
that
he
intends
to
file
suit,
and
second,
that
that
notice
remain
on
file
for
not
less
than
30
days
before
civil
action
is
instituted.
the
parties
are
in
complete
accord
that
petitioner
did
meet
both
these
deadlines.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
error
was
based
on
a
misreading
of
the
second
deadline
of
15(d)
to
mean
that
the
suit
was
untimely
because
it
was
filed
more
than
30
days
later.
this
question,
as
i
say,
this
provision
of
the
statute,
the
two
deadlines,
have
created
some
confusion
in
dictum
fortunately
in
other
courts
of
appeals
and
does
warrant
correction
by
this
court
in
connection
with
its
grant
of
certiorari
on
the
first
question
presented.
the
15(b)
exhaustion
of
remedies
questioned
is
easy
to
resolve
simply
by
reference
to
the
statutory
language.
at
the
threshold,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
allow
the
administrative
process
in
this
case
to
reach
a
final
outcome
of
rejection
of
his
complaint
as
being
filed
too
late
in
the
administrative
arena.
and
he
awaited
that
determination
before
he
filed
his
suit.
however,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
considered
this
sufficient
to
meet
the
exhaustion
requirement
each
believed
should
be
imposed.
instead,
they
articulated
an
exhaustion
requirement
analogous
to
that
imposed
on
federal
employees
who
are
seeking
relief
under
title
vii
for
race,
sex,
religion,
national
origin,
or
color-based
discrimination.
and
that
exhaustion
requirement
does,
under
the
precedent
of
this
court
and
the
express
terms
of
that
statute,
bar
review
on
the
merits
of
a
claim
if
the
administrative
process
has
been
invoked
in
an
untimely
fashion
as
it
was
here.
the
clear
language
of
section...
of
the
adea,
however,
distinguishes
the
adea
of...
from
title
vii
with
respect
to
the
conditions
they
impose
on
seeking
federal
relief.
as
noted,
the
adea
requires
only
that
civil
action
be
proceeded
by
a
brief
notice
period
during
which
the
prospective
defendant
may
learn
of
the
claim
and
remove
the
cause
for
it
if
that
is
possible
within
the
time
frame.
in
contract,
title
vii
expressly
conditions
district
court
jurisdiction
on
the
aggrieved
employee's
participation
in
the
administrative
process
and
specifically
ties
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
the
right
of
the
employee
to
file
his
or
her
suit
to
the
date
on
which
the
administrative
process
is
either
concluded
or
deemed
by
statute
to
have
been
exhausted
by
the
elapsing
of
a
180-day
period.
in
light
of
these
differences,
the
analogy
to
title
vii
is
clearly
inappropriate
and
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
the
courts
below
have...
will...
who
have
found
such
an
exhaustion
requirement
have
relied
heavily
on
that
analogy.
an
interpretation
requiring
exhaustion
has
also
been
rejected
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
which
is
the
agency
charged
by
both
statutes
with
implementing
the
administrative
enforcement
procedures
under
those
statutes.
under
its
customary
practice,
this
court
should
defer
to
this
interpretation
should
it
need
to
look
at
any
other
body
after
reviewing
plain
language
of
the
statute,
because
this
is
clearly
a
very
plausible
reading
of
the
statute,
consistent
with
its
purpose,
and
because
this
is
a
longstanding
interpretation
by
the
agency
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
agency
expertise.
ms.
alison
steiner
by
what
means
has
it
ruled?
ms.
alison
steiner
the
agency
has
been
directed
by
the
act
to
establish
an
administrative
procedure
for
those
employees
who
wish
to
invoke
it.
it
has
also
been
designated
by
the
act
as
the
body
to
receive
section
15(d)
notices
and
has
promulgated
certain
regulations,
including
a
regulation
permitting
you
to
give
the
notice
to
the
agency
of
employment
as
the
agent
of
the
eeoc.
ms.
alison
steiner
yes.
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
alison
steiner
the
eeoc
has
interpreted
it
in...
to
create
the
end
point
of
its...
to
create
a
process
which...
wherein
if
they
accept
a
complaint
for
processing,
they
then
make
specific
provision
in
their
regulations
that
at
any
time
after
that
complaint
is
accepted,
or
even
if
it
is
rejected,
to
go
to
court.
ms.
alison
steiner
certainly.
ms.
alison
steiner
certainly
the...
this
court
is
the
arbiter
of
what
the
law
says.
the
eeoc
has
spoken
on
the
subject.
whether
or
not
it's
within
the
ambit
is
for
this
court
to
decide.
ms.
alison
steiner
certainly.
ms.
alison
steiner
well--
ms.
alison
steiner
--certainly.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
at
this
time,
we
would
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time.
ms.
alison
steiner
your
honor,
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court--
