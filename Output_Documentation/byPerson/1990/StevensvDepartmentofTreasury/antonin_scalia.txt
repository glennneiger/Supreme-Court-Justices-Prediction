justice
scalia
there's
nobody
representing
that
other
point
of
view
here
really,
is
there?
justice
scalia
the
government
agrees
with
you
on
this
point?
justice
scalia
and
it
agrees
with
you
on
the
next
point
you're
going
to
argue.
justice
scalia
so
we're
not
going
to
get
a
whole
lot
of
help.
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
how
does
the
agency
get
to
rule
on
that
particular
issue?
i
mean,
how
does
that--
justice
scalia
--why
is
that
issue
relevant
to
the
agency's
administration
of
the
act?
justice
scalia
right,
but
the
issue
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
when
the
agency
receives
it
or
when
the
agency
won't
receive
it.
the
issue
here
has
to
do
with
when
a
court
will
be
precluded
from
entertaining
an
action.
isn't
that
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about?
justice
scalia
and
that
doesn't
really
have
anything
to
do...
i
mean,
assuming
we
give
deference
to
the
eeoc,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we
would
give
deference
to
the
eeoc
on
a
point
that
really
concerns
the
courts
and
not
the
eeoc.
justice
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
they
can
decide
when
they'll
process,
but
we
can
decide
when
we
accept
suits.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that's
out
of
their
bailiwick.
justice
scalia
well,
you
know,
i
mean,
that's...
it's
all
within
our
ambit
of
course.
justice
scalia
but
many
things
are
initially
at
least
within
the
ambit
of
the
eeoc.
this
thing
doesn't
seem
to
me
initially
within
their
ambit.
justice
scalia
it's
initially
within
the
ambit
of
the
court.
justice
scalia
well,
you're
going
to
tell
us
the
same
thing
that
the
other
side
told
us,
right?
justice
scalia
that's
very
nice.
we
have
the
government
who
has
a...
who
has
an
interest
in
coming
out
that
way.
the
eeoc
would
like
the
adea
to
be
interpreted
as
strictly
as
possible,
and
we
have
a
claimant
who
would
like
it
to
be
interpreted
as
strictly
as
possible.
and
who's
representing
the
other
point
of
this
issue?
and
there
is
a
circuit
split.
there
are
private
employers
who
are
going
to
be
hit
with
suits
under
the
adea.
and
that
side
of...
that
side
of
the
case
is
never
going
to
be
heard
here.
justice
scalia
well,
that
isn't
right.
you
represent
the
employer
here,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
which
is
the
employer.
justice
scalia
we
you
do...
we
do
have
an
employer
before
us.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
represented
the
united
states,
which
includes
not
just
the
treasury
but
also
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
whose
interest
in
this
matter
is
quite
different
from
that
of
treasury.
justice
scalia
and
you
didn't
agree
in
the
lower
court
either
on
the
exhaustion
issue,
did
you?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
they
do
quote
correctly
from
your
brief
in
the
court--
justice
scalia
well,
there
are
really
three
questions
here,
right?
justice
scalia
on
all
of
which
you
are
arguing
the
other
side's
point
of
view
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
right?
justice
scalia
you
could
have
divided
up
the
argument
with
the
other
side.
you
could
have
argued
one
point
and
they
could
have
argued
two.
