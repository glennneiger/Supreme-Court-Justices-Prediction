justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
it
we
are
confronted
with
some
rather
complex
procedural
problems.
petitioner,
stevens
who
in
his
60s,
was
subjected
to
an
adverse
personnel
action
by
his
employer
the
internal
revenue
service.
he
felt
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
age
discrimination
and
he
attempted
to
invoke
his
agency's
administrative
procedure
for
resolving
a
claim
of
that
kind.
he
had
got
no
where
in
that
channel
and
then
instituted
suit
in
the
western
district
of
texas.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
petitioner's
civil
action
was
timely
under
the
applicable
statute.
we,
however,
do
not
address
the
question
whether
having
filed
an
administrative
complaint.
stevens
was
required
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
before
filling
his
civil
action.
we
refrain
from
taking
such
a
step
because
the
government,
in
direct
contradiction
of
its
position
before
the
court
of
appeals,
now
fully
agrees
with
stevens
that
exhaustion
was
not
required.
and
thus,
there
is
no
one
before
us
in
an
adversarial
position
to
that
of
stevens.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore,
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
