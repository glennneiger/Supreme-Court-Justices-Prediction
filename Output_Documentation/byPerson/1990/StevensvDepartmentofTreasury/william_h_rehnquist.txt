chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1821,
charles
z.
stevens,
iii
versus
the
department
of
the
treasury.
ms.
steiner.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
steiner,
did
your
client
or
you
urge
this
point
in
the
court
of
appeals
relying
on
633(d)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
question
presented
that
subsumed
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
steiner.
ms.
wax,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
wax,
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
fact
consider
and
rule
on
that
point
though,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
first
question
presented
in
the
petition,
the
construction
of
1633(a)(d)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it...
it
seems
to
me
in
other
cases...
now
maybe
i'm
wrong...
we
have
treated
as
available
for
our
consideration
issues
that
were
decided
by
a
court
of
appeals,
even
though
they
may
not
have
been
proper...
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
could
properly
have
said
to
the
appellant
or
the
appellee,
you
have
not
properly
preserved
this.
if
the
court
of
appeals
go
ahead...
goes
and
decides
it,
i
think
we've
said
then
we
can
decide
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
entitled
to
argue
certainly
or
make
the
point
that
perhaps
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
but
i
wouldn't
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
on
it
i
think
after
the
court
has
granted
certiorari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
isn't
bound
to
recommend
a
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
every
time
a
lower
court
makes
an
error
in
favor
of
the
government.
i
mean,
there
are
numerous
erroneous
decisions
that
this
court
can't
review
and
that
we're
quite
content
to
deny
certiorari
on--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--now...
you're
now
addressing
the
first
question
or
the...
or
the
second
question
on
the
merit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
your...
your
first
position
on
the
second
question,
if
i'm
right
is
that
we
should
not
reach
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
now...
but
now
you're
saying
if
we
do
reach
it,
this
is
the
correct
result
to
reach?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
ms.
steiner,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
15
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
steiner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1821,
stevens
versus
department
of
the
treasury
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
