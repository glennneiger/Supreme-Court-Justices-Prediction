ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
has
no
serious
disagreement
with
petitioner's
position
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court,
however,
we
remain
puzzled
as
to
why
we
are
here
at
all.
the
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
it
will
not
pass
on
issues
neither
presented
nor
decided
in
the
courts
below.
the
government
adheres
to
its
position
which
was
stated
in
our
opposition
to
certiorari
and
in
our
brief
that
petitioner
never
asked
the
courts
below
to
rule
on
the
issue
he
now
wishes
this
court
to
consider:
whether
he
is
entitled
to
direct
judicial
consideration
of
his
age
discrimination
claim
without
prior
administrative
review.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it
did.
the
court
of
appeals
spontaneously
addressed
the
requirements
for
suit
under
section
15(d)
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
it
is
our
view
that
the
petitioner
did
not
ask
them
to
do
so,
but
they
did.
and
they
decided
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
saying
that
suit
had
to
be
filed
within
180
days
of
a
discriminatory
event.
they
corrected
that
mistake,
but
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
petitioner's
lawsuit
was...
his
filing
of
a
lawsuit
was
not
effective.
they
ruled
that
both
the
administrative
route
to
relief
and
the
direct
judicial
route
to
relief
under
section
15(d)
was
blocked.
they
never
considered...
they
never
needed
to
consider
or
address
the
issue...
or
at
least
one
of
the
main
issues...
the
issue
on
which
there's
a
circuit
split,
whether
there
is
an
exhaustion
or
election
of
remedies
requirement
under
the
age
act.
because
both
paths
were
blocked,
they
never
had
occasion
to
consider
what
would
happen
if
one
path
was
open.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
our
theory
of
the
case
is
that
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
the
court
says
if
in
fact
their
comments
or
their
statements
are
not
encompassed
by
the
question
as
framed
by
the
petitioner.
our
understanding
of
the
question
framed
by
the
petitioner
is
a
quite
narrow
one.
was
the
agency's
ruling
that
the
administrative
complaint
was
untimely,
was
that
ruling
in
error?
that
is,
as
we
understand
it,
the
issue
presented
by
petitioner
to
the
court.
and
that's
confirmed
by
what
petitioner
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
that
may
be
the
case.
and
we...
we
agree
that
there
certainly
is
a
way
of
looking
at
this
case.
there
is
possibly
a
way
of
looking
at
this
case
such
that
at
least
question
1
is
implicated
in
petitioner's
submission.
we...
the
analogy
we
would
draw
is
this.
let
me...
let
me
give
you
a
comparison.
it's
as
if
petitioner
came
into
a
lower
court
and
said,
we
want
damages,
we
deserve
damages.
and
respondent
said,
you
don't
deserve
damages,
and
you
don't
deserve
equitable
relief
either,
because
you
don't
have
clean
hands.
the
court
agreed,
you
don't
deserve
equitable
relief.
they
both
happened
to
be
wrong
about
equitable
relief,
but
petitioner
didn't
ask
them
for
that.
petitioner
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals,
reverse
the
district
court
on
your
ruling
that
my
administrative
filing
was
untimely.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
as
we
understand...
i
mean,
if
in
fact
that's
the
case,
it...
it
allows
a
respondent
or
a
court
to
load
into
a
lawsuit
all
sorts
of
issues
that
might
be
quite
extraneous.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
it's
true
that
we
did
make
a
statement
about
exhaustion
in
our
court
of
appeals
brief.
that's
correct.
there
were
two
lines
in
a
court
of
appeals
brief
that
addressed
exhaustion.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we...
we
submit
that
it
may
be
that
the
reading...
what
15(d)
requires
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
in
no
way
was
exhaustion
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
simply
never
got
to
the
point
where
it
needed
to
decide
that.
it
decided
that
both
paths
were
blocked.
you
could...
he
could
not
get
administrative
relief
because
he
did
not
file
timely--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it's
related,
but
the
exhaustion
question
is
farther
down
the
line.
the
courts
decide
questions
all
the
time
which,
if
they
had
decided
them
differently,
would
require
them
to
go
on
and
decide
a
further
question.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly.
that's
the
ground
on
which
we
understand
they
affirmed
it.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
if
this
court--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--they
appeared
to
decide--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
went
on--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
went
on
to
address
the
issue,
your
honor,
because
we
felt
that
this
court
wanted
us
to
do
so.
but
we
stand
by
our
argument
that
at
least...
we
are
firm
in
our
view
that
the
exhaustion
and
election
issue
was
neither
argued
nor
decided,
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
to
decide
it.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
administrative
filing
was
untimely
and
the
civil
action
filing
was
untimely.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we...
we
certainly
concede
that
it's
not,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
the
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
review
this
case,
because
there
was
a
circuit
split
on
the
exhaustion
and
election
issue.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
would
certainly
be
an
appropriate
course
of
action.
respectfully,
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
we
opposed
certiorari,
we
viewed
the
first
question
as
not
one
that
would
warrant
a
plenary
consideration
since
it
was
such
an
obvious
error.
that's
the
only
reason
that
we...
we
also
believed
that
that
question
wasn't
properly
presented.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
do,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
exhaustion
and
election
of
remedies
issue--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
couldn't
agree
more.
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
represent
the
department
of
the
treasury.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
which
is
the
employer.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
the
eeoc's
interpretation
of
the
statutes.
and
we
happen
to
be
here
defending
their
regulations.
but
our
client
is
the
department
of
treasury.
at
this
point
there...
they
have
agreed
that
on
the
law...
on
their
interpretation
of
the
law,
that
might
not
have
been
the
case.
i
mean,
in
another...
one
could
imagine
a
situation
where
that
might
not
have
been
the
case.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
took
a
different
position,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but
we
have
reconsidered
our
position.
but
the
fact
that
there's
no...
there
no
one
up
here
arguing
the
other
side,
and
the
very
fact
that
we're
here
arguing
an
obvious
question
of
law,
an
obvious
error,
is
testimony
to
the
defects
in
the
presentation
below.
not
to
belabor
this
point,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
we
believe
that
if
petitioner
had
squarely
argued
the
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
corrected
our
misstatement
of
the
law...
what
we
concede
to
be
a
misstatement
at
15(d)...
this
problem
would
never
have
come
up
on
15(d),
and
the
lower
court
would
have
had
a
chance
to
decide
the
exhaustion
election
issue,
which
they
never
even
addressed.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
did,
your
honor.
in
our
opposition
to
cert.
in
this
case,
we
suggested
in
the
alternative
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
exhaustion
and
election
of
remedies
issue
because
the
court
had
never
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
it.
and
it
is
a
vexed
issue,
and
one
on
which
the
courts
have
disagreed.
and
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion.
we
agree
with
that.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we...
we...
our
first
line
recommendation
in
our
position
was
to
deny.
but
given
some
ambiguity
perhaps
in
what
was
presented
below,
we
said
in
the
alternative,
grant,
vacate,
and
remand.
we
also
think
that
affirming
would
be
a
legitimate
course
of
action
because
we
think
that
the
30-day...
the
administrative
timeliness
issue
was
really
the
only
one
that
was
central
to
the
case.
there
are
a
number
of
possible
courses
of
action.
with--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
that
rests
on
our
view
of
this
case
as
presenting
the
issue
only
of
the
timeliness
of
the
administrative
filing.
the...
the
issue
of
whether
the
court
could
directly
consider
the
claim
was
one
that
we
view
as
being
injected
by
the
court
and
the
respondent.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
court
doesn't
agree.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--they
do,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
only
on
our
theory
that
a
respondent
cannot
really
enlarge
the
issue
that's
argued
by
a
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
frames
the
issue
for
the
court.
that's
the
way
we
view
the
analysis.
and
that's
our
analysis.
just
a
few
comments
on
the
merits.
we
do
see
this
as
a
chevron
case,
one
in
which
the
agency...
the
eeoc...
has
been
charged
with
deciding
what
administrative
process
is
necessary
to
resolve
a
discrimination
claim
and
when
that
administrative
process
is
done.
given
that
the
statute
is
completely
silent
on
the
administrative
prerequisites
to
filing
of
a
civil
action,
which
all
age
litigants
are
entitled
to
do,
save
the
requirement
that
there
be
notice
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
we
believe
that
the
eeoc's
regulations
are
reasonable
and
should
be
given
deference
under
the
act.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
are
addressing
the
second
question,
the
exhaustion
and
election
question.
but
we'd
be
happy
to
address
the
first.
we've
already
conceded
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
court
is
in
error
on
the
first.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct,
your
honor.
we
understood
the
court
as
wanting
us
to
reach
the
question
in
granting
certiorari
on
both
questions.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
correct.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
probably
right.
we
have
in
fact
had
two
positions
on
exhaustion
and
election.
our
position
is
that
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement
whatsoever.
but
that
even
if
there
is
one,
petitioner
did
everything
that
should
be
required
under
this
act,
because
he
waited
for
a
final
agency
decision.
it
was
a
decision
on
timeliness,
but
it
was
a
final
agency
decision.
just
on
that
particular--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
your
honor.
just
to
make
one
point
on
this.
if
the
court
does
reach
the
exhaustion
issue,
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
it
is
sufficient
for
an
age
act
plaintiff...
is
sufficient
for
him
to
file
a
claim
with
the
agency
and
then
go
to
court
anytime
he
wants,
thereby
prematurely
terminating
his
agency
process.
this
particular
plaintiff,
petitioner
mr.
stevens,
did
not
do
that.
he
got
a
final
agency
decision.
it
is
our
position
that
this
final
agency
decision
was
enough
under
the
act.
the
act
does
not
require
any
plaintiff
at
all
to
go
to
the
agency
before
they
go
to
court.
as
far
as
congress
was
concerned,
all
age
act
plaintiffs
could
go
directly
to
court.
therefore,
it
makes
no
sense
to
require
an
individual
to
get
a
ruling
on
the
merits
from
the
agency
before
going
to
court.
it
would
only
make
sense
minimally
to
require
someone
to
get
a
final
decision,
which
this
person
did.
now,
it
is
also
our
position
that
that
is
also
unreasonable
for
reasons
stated
in
our
brief,
mainly
because
the
act
does
not
allow
plaintiffs
to
bail
out
of
the
administrative
process
after
180
days,
like
the...
like
title
vii
does.
so
it
does
not
make
sense
to
even
require
petitioner
to
do
what
he
did
here.
however,
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
this
individual
was
entitled
to
have
his
age
discrimination
suit
decided
on
the
merits
by
the
district
court.
if
there
are
not
further
questions.
