justice
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
and
stick
with
your
hypothetical
for
a
second.
supposing
they
just
asked
for
damages,
but...
and
didn't
have
a
prayer
for
equitable
relief.
then
the
government
comes
in
and
says,
you're
not
entitled
to
either.
and
the
court
says,
you're
not
entitled
to
either.
and
then
they
appeal.
and...
can
they
not
then
argue
that
there's
enough
in
the
complaint
so
the
matter
of
remedy
can
be
addressed
later?
i
don't
think
that
they
forfeit
potential
remedy,
because
they
didn't
put
it
in
the
complaint.
justice
stevens
i...
it
seems
to
me
your
example
proves
the
opposite
of
what
you're
contending.
justice
stevens
and
if
they
didn't
rely
on
that
ground,
why
did
they
affirm?
justice
stevens
well,
what
difference
would
it
make...
if
you
don't
require
exhaustion,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
you
couldn't
get
administrative
relief?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that's
integrally
related
to
the
exhaustion
argument.
justice
stevens
well,
they
review
judgments.
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
the
complaint
had
to
be
dismissed.
and
they
affirmed
that
judgment.
and
i
don't
understand
under
your
presentation
why
they
affirmed
the
judgment
if
they
didn't
decide
some
legal
basis
for
doing
so.
well,
they
could
have
affirmed
but
just
on
the
narrow
ground
that
their
suit
was
ineffective,
because
it
wasn't
filed
in
time.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
why,
if
it's
such
plain
error,
why
the
solicitor
general
didn't
suggest
that
we
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
for...
to
correct
the
obvious
error?
why
did
you
suggest
we
deny
certiorari?
justice
stevens
--how
can
you
say
affirming
would
be
proper
if
it's
plain
that
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error?
justice
stevens
but
you
concede.
and
this
is
a
litigant
who
will
not
have
his
day
in
court,
because
the
district
court
committed
an
obvious
error,
and
the
court
of
appeals
committed
an
obvious
error.
and
you
say
we
should
affirm?
justice
stevens
well,
why
wasn't
it
injected
by
your
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals?
why
wasn't
that
injecting
the
issue?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
stevens
--okay,
i
see--
