justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
its
ground
was...
on
which
you
lost
was
this
mistake
you
just
mentioned.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
in
your
example
that
loaded
an
issue
in--
--and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
didn't
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
argue
the
exhaustion
point?
they
quoted...
and
maybe
this
is
wrong...
but
in
their
reply
brief,
they
quote
what
purports
to
be
the
government's
brief,
arguing
exhaustion
apparently
thinking
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
decide
that
in
order
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
and
if
they
didn't
decide
it,
how
could
they
possibly
affirm
the
judgment?
justice
white
well,
then...
and
certainly
that
issue
is
open
here,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
they...
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it.
justice
white
and
they...
and
the
petitioner
complains
about
that
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
conceded
in
your...
i
thought
you
conceded
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
court
was
dead
wrong
on
that
point.
justice
white
i
mean
in
your
response.
justice
white
well,
what
if...
what
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that?
it
still
leaves
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
on
the
time
question.
and
you
could...
i
think
you
concede
that
it
was
not.
justice
white
i
mean
at
the
time
of
filing
this
suit.
justice
white
well,
just
stick
to
my
question.
justice
white
what
about
the
issue
of
the
time?
that's
here.
it's
got
to
be
decided,
and
you
concede
this
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
justice
white
all
right,
if
it
was
wrong,
and
say
we
agree
with
you
on
the
exhaustion
thing,
that
it
isn't
here.
but
the
other
one
is.
and
what
should
we
do
then?
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
do
we?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
we...
but
the
question
is
here.
we...
there
is...
the
issue
is
here
now
and
it's
being
argued.
and
you
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
dead
wrong.
