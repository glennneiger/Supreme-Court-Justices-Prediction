justice
kennedy
counsel,
on
this
point,
as
i
recall
the
opinion
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
it
cited
no
state
authority
in
support
of
its
holding
on
this...
that
you
have
just
quoted
from
the
syllabus.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
can
you
tell
me...
can
you
make
an
inference
as
to
why
in
preparing
the
syllabus,
whoever
prepares
it,
the
court
focused
on
just
the
opinion
as
to
the
ultimate
issue,
as
opposed
to
the
other
kinds
of
booth-gathers
evidence
that
really
was
introduced
into
this
trial?
what--
justice
kennedy
--can
we
speculate
on
why
that
might
be?
justice
kennedy
--do
you
think
that
if
booth
and
gathers
were
overruled
we
might
expect
that
the
kind
of
testimony
that
was
in
this
transcript
would
be
fairly
typical
in
death
penalty
sentencing
proceedings
in
which
the
father
of
the
victim
recommends
the
death
penalty?
justice
kennedy
so
you
think
that
some
of
the
testimony
here
went
beyond--
justice
kennedy
--what's
appropriate?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
father's
testimony?
the
state
introduced
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
don't,
i
don't
see
why
the
same
thing
wouldn't
have
occurred
if
booth
and
gathers
were
somehow
off
the
books.
justice
kennedy
but
you...
but
you
indicate
that
it's
inappropriate.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
how,
if
you
thought
the
mother's
testimony
was
appropriate...
was
inappropriate,
that
the
trial
was
made
all
that
much
better
by
introducing
further
inappropriate
testimony
by
the
father
on
the
same
subject.
justice
kennedy
it's
a
rather
strange
argument
to
say
that
the
existence
of
booth
and
gathers
invites
testimony
of
this
sort.
i
just
can't
follow
that.
justice
kennedy
but
that
doesn't
reach
the
opinion
on
the
ultimate
issue,
testimony
by
the
father.
justice
kennedy
--is
booth
and
gathers...
are
booth
and
gathers
then
just
a
shorthand
way
for
us
to
ensure
that
no
inflammatory
testimony
is
being
introduced
at
the
trial?
is
that
what
booth
and
gathers
are
really
directed
to?
justice
kennedy
it's
an
overly
inclusive
and
overly
constrictive
rule?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
there
an
ohio
constitutional
provision
that
gives...
that
requires
that
the
sentencing
decision
be
made
by
the
judge
and
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
under
the
ohio
constitution?
justice
kennedy
now
wait,
is
this
an
ohio
constitutional
provision?
justice
kennedy
and
what
are...
do
you
cite
those
decisions
in
your
brief?
justice
kennedy
and
just
to
be
clear,
that
rests
on
ohio
constitutional
law?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
they...
do
they
cite
the
state
constitution?
justice
kennedy
now,
this
is
a
statute
which
allow
victim
impact
testimony
generally?
justice
kennedy
are
you
going
to
argue
that
booth
and
gathers
should
not
be
overruled?
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
think
that's
wrong?
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
reach
the
booth-gathers
issue?
justice
kennedy
so
you
don't
care
if
we
overrule
booth
and
gathers?
