justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you?
i
hate
to
do
this,
but
you
say
from
reading
the
opinion.
i
remember
justice
stewart
used
to
lecture
me
periodically
about
the
importance
of
the
syllabus
in
ohio
law.
now,
what
does
the
syllabus
say
the
holding
is?
justice
stevens
but
do
those
cases,
do
booth
or
gathers
deal
with
the
issue
discussed
in
the
syllabus?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure...
are
you
now
reading
from
the
syllabus
or
the
opinion?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
references
to
the
cases
that
you
just
made
is
not
in
the
syllabus,
is
it?
justice
stevens
i
think
one
can
read
the
discussion
on
page
21
of
the
cert.
petition
as
indicating
they
thought
that
booth
and
gathers
were
so
far
different
that
even
the
dissenting
justices'
opinions
in
booth
and
gathers
would
not
have
applied
to
this
case.
that's
what
i
read
them
as
saying
in
so
many
words.
justice
stevens
yes,
at
page
21.
justice
stevens
but,
as
i
say,
they're
talking
about
the
position
of
the
dissenters
in
booth
and
gathers
in
there.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
rosenbaum,
about
the
need
to
overrule
booth
because
of
the
harm
it
has
done
in
excluding
this
victim
impact
evidence?
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
page
13
points
out
that
in
state
against
post,
which
was
also
a
1987
case,
they
noted
that
the
admission
of
victim
impact
evidence
at
capital
trials
was
not
expressly
permitted
by
the
ohio
statute.
i
drew
the
inference,
perhaps
erroneously,
and
this
is
why
i
wanted
to
ask
you
as
an
ohio
lawyer,
that
prior
to
post
and
prior
to
booth
there
probably
were
not
any
ohio
cases
approving
the
use
of
victim
impact
evidence
in
capital
trials?
justice
stevens
so
that
really
all
booth
did,
as
far
as
ohio
law
was
concerned,
was
maintain
the
status
quo?
justice
stevens
well,
how...
in
what
respect
did
it
change
it?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
i
gather
there
are
no
ohio
cases
permitting
it
either?
justice
stevens
but
ms....
may
i
interrupt
you,
ms.
bour-stokes?
justice
stevens
do
they
discuss
any
federal
constitutional
decision
discussing
the
constitutional
right
to
having
the
sentencing
decision
made
by
the
jury?
justice
stevens
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
constitutional
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
mr.
rosenbaum,
there
is...
isn't
there
also
a
one-sidedness
in
the
whole
business
of
you're
limited
to
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
on
the
one
side,
but
on
the
other
side
they
can
use
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances?
that's
kind
of
one-sided,
too.
justice
stevens
and
it's
probably
unconstitutional,
too,
under
your
argument.
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
of
course
it's
kind
of
one-sided
that
they
have
to
prove
their
case
by
a...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
too.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
some
one-sided
things
are
okay,
and
others
are
not.
