mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
today
is
about
fair
and
evenhanded
justice
for
the
accuser.
i
have
three
points
i
would
like
to
briefly
make
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
firstly,
i
submit
there
is
no
independent
state
ground
upon
which
the
lower
court
decision
was
predicated.
it
is
obvious
from
a
reading
of
the
opinion
that
the
sole
authority
relied
upon
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
this
court's
holdings
in
booth
and
gathers.
secondly,
the
evidence--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--the
syllabus
in
this
case
is
taken
directly
from
the
text
of
the
opinion
from
section
1(e),
and
it
says
expressions
of
opinion
by
a
witness
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
a
particular
sentence
in
a
capital
case
violate
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
to
have
the
sentencing
decision
made
by
the
jury
and
judge.
and
they
argue
to
the
court
that
the
key
word
there
is
constitutional
right.
and
the
only
authority,
indeed
the
only
constitutional
authority
cited
and
relied
upon
by
the
ohio
supreme
court,
is
booth
and
gathers.
and
in
fact,
the
very
next
sentence--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--absolutely.
they
deal
with
the
constitutional
ramifications
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
felt
to
comply...
to
take
out
the
opinion
evidence
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
evidence
of
harm
caused
to
the
victims
in
general.
and
i
submit
that
the
very
next
line
of
the
opinion
from
that
same
section
says,
after
reviewing
the
arguments
presented
we
find
no
grounds
on
which
to
distinguish
booth
and
gathers,
and
we
are
thus
compelled
to
follow
those
cases
and
vacate
the
sentence
of
death.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
am
reading
from
the
very
next
line
that
came
from
the
opinion...
the
syllabus.
the
syllabus
was
lifted
word
for
word
from
section
1(e)
of
the
opinion--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--that's
correct.
it's
in
the
very
next
line.
but
the
reference--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
next
line
of
the
opinion?
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--the
very
next
line
of
the
opinion,
that
is
correct.
but
the
reference
to
the
constitutional
right
is
in
the
syllabus,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
today,
not
opinion
evidence,
but
the
constitutional
ramifications
that
took
out
the
opinion
evidence
in
this
case
and
also
persuaded
the
ohio
supreme
court
through,
i
believe,
a
misinterpretation
of
gathers,
to
say
that
it
is
not
relevant
to
a
person's
moral
guilt
when
he
knowingly
causes
trauma
on
known
victims
prior
to
the
time
he
made
his
decision
of
guilt.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
mr.
justice
kennedy,
it
cited
no
other
authority
other
than
booth
and
gathers.
there
was
no
state
statutory
law,
no
state
evidentiary
rulings,
and
no
state
case
law.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
the...
booth
had...
did
not
involve
testimony--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--in
the
bronsteins'
statement
in
the
victim
impact
statement
that
was
this
court's
basis,
or
was
construed
to
be
inappropriate
by
this
court,
they
make
reference
to,
although
they
did
not
express
the
desire
to
impose
the
ultimate
penalty,
they
said
that
the
person
was
not
subject
to
rehabilitation,
that
justice
should
be
swift,
and
they
clearly
implied
what
their
thinking
was,
although
they
did
not
come
out
and
say
that.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
think
the
syllabus
clearly
points
out
that
what
is
important
here
is
the
constitutional
right,
and
i
think
the
constitutional
rights
involved,
and
whether
there
is
a
prohibition
based
upon
those
rights.
i
think
that
the
opinion
evidence
is
a
very
small
part
of
this
case,
and
it...
a
reading
of
the
entire
opinion,
although
i
concede
that
in
ohio
the
syllabus
is
the
case
law...
illustrates
this.
this
court
held
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi
that
it
will
not
assume
that
a
state
court--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--i
cannot
make--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--i
am
reluctant
to
speculate,
but
i
can
respond
to
your
question
by
saying
in
chief
justice
moyer's
concurring
opinion
he
made
it
very
clear
that
this
ruling
came
from
their
concerns
about
booth
and
gathers,
and
that
they
asked...
that
he
felt
this
was
a
very
confusing
case,
and
he
asked
for
this
court
to
review
it
and
revisit
it.
and
i
think
that
gives
us
some
insight
to
tell
you
that
this
case
is
more...
is
about
far
more
than
opinion
testimony.
and
a
reading
of
the
entire
case
shows
that
as
well.
this
court
held--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--i...
this
is
a
point
that
has
been
raised
by
the
respondent,
and
they
cite
the
case
of
state
v.
white.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
flaw
in
their
argument
is
this.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
will,
thank
you.
the
answer
is
it
does
in
the
guilt
phase,
and
that
is
what
white
deals
with.
white
was
a
1968
case,
and
it
was
written,
obviously,
way
before
ohio's
bifurcated
capital
death
penalty
scheme.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
is
not
considered
relevant.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
not
considered
relevant.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
it
is
not
considered
relevant,
and
that...
in
the
guilt
phase.
white
deals
with
the
guilt
phase,
and
the
purpose
of
bifurcating
a
capital
scheme
is
obviously
there
are
types
of
law
or
types
of
evidence
that
will
not
be
appropriate
and
will
be
prejudicial--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--no.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
there
are
not.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
it
relied
solely
upon
this
court's
interpretations
of
the
eighth
amendment
based
on
booth
and
gathers.
and
i
argue
to
this
court,
because
of
that
and
this
court's
holding
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi,
that
this
court
should
not
assume
that
a
state
court
decision
rests
on
adequate
independent
state
grounds
when
the
state
court
decision
fairly
appears
to
rest
primarily
on
federal
law
or
even
to
be
interwoven
with
federal
law.
in
this
case
the
ohio
supreme
court
expressly
relied
primarily
on
booth
and
gathers
to
reach
its
decision,
which
is
encapsulated
in
the
syllabus.
i
argue
to
you--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--you
read
the
majority
of
the
ohio
opinion
as
saying
that?
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i...
i
think
that
this
court
has
wrongfully
applied
booth
and
gathers
on
page
21.
i
mean,
of
the...
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
wrongfully
applied
this
court's
holding
in
gathers
on
that
page
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
correct.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
you
could
affirm
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision?
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
absolutely.
and
you
could
also
reverse
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--without
affecting
booth
or
gathers.
and
i
argue
to
you
that
this
is
because
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
misinterpreted
this
court's
holding
in
gathers
when
it
ruled
that
it
is
no
more
heinous
to
commit
a
crime
when
you
know
that
you
are
going
to
leave
traumatized
victims,
that
you
are
aware
of,
either
at
the
time
you
made
your
decision
to
kill
or
prior
to
making
that
decision
to
kill.
so
this
court
could
leave
gathers
intact
and
reverse
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
reinstate
the
death
penalty.
i
would
like
to
argue
today
that
booth
is
a
departure
from
this
court's
traditional
jurisprudence
which
is...
made
in
capital
litigation
cases,
which
made
an
attempt
to
channel
the
discretion
of
the
jury
and
evidence
that
it
is
to
get.
and
to
arrive
at
this
it
has
sacrificed
evidence
that
is
relevant
and
necessary,
and
that
is
victim
impact
evidence
because,
as
this
court
held
in
booth,
it
may
create
an
impermissible
risk
of
the
death
penalty
being
arbitrarily
imposed.
i
argue
to
you
that
this
presupposes
that
jurors
cannot
ever
be
channeled
or
deal
with
victim
impact
testimony
in
a
rational
way,
nor
can
trial...
nor
can
trial
courts
regulate
victim
impact
testimony.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
no.
and
i'm
going...
i'm
asking
this
court
to
overrule
booth
and
gathers
and
permit
only
objective,
factual,
easily
rebuttable,
readily
anticipatible
victim
impact
testimony.
the
opinion
evidence
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
the
opinion
evidence
in
this
case
came
in
over
the
objection
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
defense
asked
the
defendant's
mother,
in
a
question
that
presupposed
the
answer,
or
implied
it,
didn't
you
already
tell
myself
and
the
probation
officer
that
you
don't
want
the
death
penalty
imposed?
she
dodged
that
question
by
saying
i
leave
it
up
to
the
courts
and
jury.
he
then
pinned
her
down,
over
the
state's
objection,
to
say
well,
can't
you
forgive,
as
a
christian?
and
she
said
i
can.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
the
state...
absolutely.
the
state
then,
faced
with
the
implication
in
a
predominantly
christian
community
that
this
woman,
the
mother
of
the
deceased,
is
able
to
forgive
this
man
for
killing
her
son,
over
my
objection,
which
i
think
is
irrelevant
and
inappropriate,
tried
to
counter
and
neutralize
that,
and
i
called
the
father
and
asked
him
the
same
question.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
this
dichotomy
and
this
unfairness
is
the
result
of
the
regime
of
booth
and
illustrates
the
handicap
that
has
been
placed
upon
the
prosecution.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
well,
that's...
it's
possible.
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
think
it
is
inappropriate.
it
came
in
over
my
objection,
and
i
am
asking
this
court,
if
it
doesn't
see
fit
to
overrule
booth,
to
modify
it
and
provide
that
both
sides
can
bring
in
objective
and
limited
victim
impact
testimony
so
that
there
will
be
an
equal
balance
between
the
state
and
the
defense.
and
i
argue
to
you
that
the
result
of
this
prohibition
that
came
through
the
regime
of
booth
is
that
the
penalty
phase
is
now
the
mitigation
phase.
we
solely
focus
upon
the
defendant.
personal
responsibility
is
no
longer
a
function
of
the
harm
caused.
if
that
is
the
case,
just
retribution
can
no
longer
be
a
legitimate
concern
in
our
capital
sentencing
scheme.
and
i
say
that
to
you
because
if
a
jury
is
not
aware
of
the
actual
and
complete
harm
caused
through
the
admission
of
objective
victim
impact
testimony
on
both
sides,
it
cannot
express
the
community's
outrage,
conscience,
or
contemporary
values
over
a
capital
case.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
in
looking
back
on
that
case,
or
that
decision,
i
don't
know
if
i
would
have
made
it.
but
i
was
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
faced
with
the
devastating
impact
of
testimony,
prior
to
the
booth
decision,
that
a
woman
has
now
forgiven
the
murderer
of
her
son,
as
a
christian,
when
i
have
a
predominantly
if
not
entirely
christian
jury.
now
the
state
sought
to
neutralize
that,
and
maybe
in
hindsight
that
wasn't
the
best
thing
to
do.
but
i
think
a
modification
or
reversal
of
booth
will
actually
prohibit
this
in
the
future,
because
the
penalty
phase
will
be
the
penalty
phase
and
not
the
mitigation
phase,
when
the
defendant
can
offer
anything
that
he
so
desires
and
the
state
cannot
rebut
that.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
yes,
it
was.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
am
making
three
ultimate--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--this...
i
argue
to
you
that
the
evidence
in
this...
the
opinion
evidence
in
this
case,
when
the
state
went
on
to
neutralize
what
the
defendant
did,
is
either
harmless
error
or
an
invited
error,
and
this
case
is
not
about
this.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
the
existence
of
booth
and
gathers
has
created
a
one-sided
regime,
and
this
case
illustrates
that.
and
in
an
effort
to
let
the...
or
offenders,
prove
their
mitigation,
they
can
put
in
anything
they
want
and
the
state
cannot.
an
example
of
that
is
this
case.
the
defendant
calls
his
entire
family
to
the
stand,
or
enough
of
it
to
testify
about
the
rest
of
the
family,
and
they
testify
about
their
mutual
love
relationship
and
the
benefits
that
the
respondent
has
caused
them.
what
they
are
saying
is
his
death
will
impact
upon
our
lives.
but
the
state
cannot
counter
that
by
putting
on
the
actual
impact
of
the
murder
that
the
respondent
caused.
and
this
one-sided
thing,
i
think,
goes
back
to
the
point
that
we
have
taken
retribution
out
of
the
term
"professional
responsibility".
this
court
has
acknowledged,
and
the
entire
history
of
capital
jurisprudence
in
this
country
acknowledges
that
communities
should
express
the
public
outrage,
concern,
and
contemporary
values,
and
that
retribution
is
a
valid
and
constitutional
consideration
in
a
capital
sentencing.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
am
asking
first
and
foremost
for
you
to
overrule
booth
and
put
the
balance
back
in
this,
to
make
the
penalty
phase--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--you
could
modify
booth,
or
even
to
get
what
i
really
need,
i
guess,
in
this
case
is
you
could
just
rule
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
misinterpreted
gathers,
and
because
the
respondent
knew
of
the
trauma
he
was
going
to
cause
prior
to
his
decision
to
kill,
that
was
relevant
to
his
moral
guilt,
much
less
personal
responsibility,
which
is
the
other
issue
i
am
arguing,
and
therefore
the
ohio
supreme
court
erred.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
well,
i
think
it
does,
because
that...
that
opinion
is
based
upon
the
constitutional
restraints
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
felt
it
was
operating
under
as
a
result
of
booth
and
gathers.
this
opinion
is
far
broader--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--exactly.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
exactly.
that's
how
they
interpreted
that.
i
want
to
follow
up
on
my
point
that
as
a
result
of
juries'
not
being
able
to
express
the
community's
conscience,
contemporary
values,
and
outrage,
that
our
system
of
justice...
the
public
may
lose
faith
in
our
system
of
justice
because
the
public
will
be
aware
of
the
actual
harm
caused,
but
because
of
booth
the
sentencing
jury
will
not
be,
and
if
they
are
they
can't
use
it.
as
a
result
of
that,
punishment
will
not
fit
the
crime.
the
jury
cannot
express
the
community's
outrage
because
the
jury
does
not
know
what
the
community
knows.
and
we
have
taken
harm
out
of
the
personal
responsibility
equation.
i
also
argue
to
this
court
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies
to
all
criminal
cases,
yet
only
in
capital
cases
does
it
preclude
victim
impact
testimony.
this
is
not
required
by
the
text
of
the
constitution.
our
history
is
rich
in
examples
where
offenders
have
been
punished
for
the
harm
they
caused,
whether
they
intended
it
or
not.
the
fiola
case
dealing
with
federal
officers,
roberts
v.
louisiana,
and
presidential
assassination
statutes...
there
is
a
federal
one
which
authorizes
the
death
penalty
as
well
as
aggravating
circumstances
for
that
type
of
killing.
these
are
inconsistent
with
booth
and
produce
anomalous
results.
and
despite
this
history,
booth
precludes
jurors
from
knowing
the
actual
harm
caused,
and
it
does
so
at
a
time
when
modern
thought
requires
that
victims
be
included
in
our
system
of
justice
so
that
they
can
be
addressed
and
redressed,
not
excluded.
i
argue
to
you
that
the
per
se
exclusion
of
booth
is
over
broad,
and
that
the
harm
that
it
seeks
to
cause,
that
risk
can
be
dealt
with
by
the
traditional
methods
normally
associated
with
our
everyday
trials
in
our
criminal
justice
system.
these
safeguards
include
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
the
bifurcated
nature
of
our
capital
penalty
litigation
scheme,
and
mandatory
review
at
all
levels.
i
am
asking
you
to
overrule
booth
and
permit
the
inclusion
of
reliable
and
objective
victim
impact
evidence
on
both
sides.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
think
what
we
know
now
is
that
booth
has
created
confusion,
that
booth
has
taken
the
retribution
aspect
out
of
capital
sentencing,
and
that
it...
basically,
it
is
wrong.
and
the
lower
courts
and
the
state
courts
are
having
a
hard
time
applying
it.
there
are
anomalous
results,
there
are
inconsistent
results
based
upon
the
statutes
and
specifications.
if
you
consider
assassination
of
the
president,
am
i
precluded
now
from
offering
evidence
that
the
victim
of
this
crime
is
the
president
of
the
united
states?
booth
is
inconsistent
with
that,
and
i
know
that
you
have
argued
that
in
your
dissenting
opinions
in
both
booth
and...
and
gathers.
i
am
asking
you
to
overrule
booth
and
include
objective
victim
impact
evidence,
not
opinion.
if
this
court
will
not
do
that,
i
am
asking
you
to
modify
it
so
the
state
is
on
an
even
keel,
so
that
the
state
can
put
on
testimony
concerning
the
actual
impact
felt
and
caused
by
the
murder,
as
opposed
to
the
potential
impact
that
is
going
to
fall
to
the
defendant's
family
if
he
is
executed.
and
if
this
court
does
not
see
fit
to
do
that,
i
then,
as
my
final
argument,
ask
you
to
overrule
state
v.
huertas
and
reinstate
the
death
penalty
because
the
known
harm
caused
to
a
victim
and
his
family
that
you
are
aware
of
prior
to
your
decision
to
kill
is
relevant
to
your
moral
guilt
and
says
something
about
your
blameworthiness,
and
thus
should
be
considered.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
that...
the
protections
are
twofold,
or
they
are,
one,
these
are
the
things
that
our
trial
courts
deal
with
in
everyday
life.
you
know,
there
is
little
difference
if
i
put
the
widow...
or
the
grieving
mother
as
it
was
in
this
case,
on
the
stand
in
the
guilt
phase
because
she
actually
witnessed
the
threats
that
this
man
made
that
exemplify
or
demonstrate
his
prior
calculation
and
design.
these
are
things
that
we
have
to
deal
with
on
an
everyday
basis:
prejudicial
evidence
and
weighing
the
probative
value
of
that
evidence.
we
have
consistently
called
upon
our
trial
courts
to
make
the
proper
judgments
in
these
manners
in
every
case,
in
every
way
except
booth.
for
some
reason
we
have
decided
that
the
systems
that
we
have...
the
history
of
our
country
has
built
into
the
criminal
justice
system
are
no
longer
adequate
to
deal
with
grief.
and
the
grief
of
a
mother
or
the
grief
of
a
widow
is
something
that
every
juror
realizes.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
i
think
booth...
that
is...
i
have
no
quarrel
with
your
statement
except
other
than
shorthand.
i
think
it
is,
it
is
longhand
and
it
is
too
long.
and
that
this...
these
are...
this
is
evidence
that
is
needed
by
the
state
to
prove
certain
elements
of
the
case
that
are
relevant
to
retribution
so
that
the
jury
can
actually
speak
to
the
community's
conscience,
outrage,
and
contemporary
values
in
the
imposition--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--that
is
exactly
my
point.
it
is
over
broad.
the
safeguards
which
we
have
trusted
in
every
other
area
of
criminal
justice...
our
criminal
justice
system...
with
regarding
prejudicial
versus
probative
value
of
any
piece
of
evidence,
whether
it
be
victim
testimony,
whether
it
be
the
photographs
of
a
murder
victim
at
the
scene.
these
safeguards
have
always
served
us
well,
but
this
court,
because
it
was
afraid
that
there
may
be
an
impermissible
risk
of
an
arbitrarily
imposed
death
penalty,
i
think
has
overreacted
and
has
handicapped
the
state.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
no,
i
disagree.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
because
the
legislature
has
refused
to
specifically
include,
make
it
mandatory
that
victim
impact
evidence--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--be
included.
the
legislative
history,
as
documented
by
the...
refiled
by
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers,
documents
that
the
legislature
refused
to
make
it
mandatory
inclusion.
that
is
a
vast--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--there
is
no
ohio
case...
well,
with
the
exception
of...
the
issue
really
has
not
been
addressed.
and
the
reason
is,
and
as
booth
says--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
that's
my
very
point.
--and
it
quotes
ohio
revised
code
section
2929.03(d)(1),
which
says
it
does
not
expressly
authorize
it,
but
there
has,
the
legislature
has
refused
to
speak,
and
it
has
not
been
excluded
in
any
way.
and
as
a
result
of
the
booth
regime
it
is
not
going
to
come
in
in
ohio.
did
the
legislature
refuse
to
speak
pre-booth
or
post-booth?
when,
when
was
that?
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--it
was
pre-booth.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
well,
first
of
all,
the
ohio
statutory
scheme
as
it
exists
does
not
make...
does
not
make
it
mandatory
that
it
be
included.
i
don't
know
if
you
understood
that.
the
victim
impact
legislation
in
ohio
clearly
makes
it
mandatory
in
all
other
areas
but
capital
litigation.
and
so
the
legislature
has
not
spoken
in
any
way,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
legislature
can
speak
now
in
light
of
the
ohio
supreme
court's
constitutional
ruling
based
on
booth
and
gathers.
however,
i
think
what
should
be
included
is,
as
i
have
been
arguing,
is
that
victims
should
be
free
to
come
to
court
and
express
objective
thoughts
about
their
losses.
not
that
i
love
you,
i
miss
you,
that
kind
of
stuff,
but
truly
objective
thoughts
that
can
be
anticipated
and
rebutted.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
the
only
statute
that
may
apply
to
this
type
of
situation
is
ohio
revised
code
section
2929.03(d)(1),
which
makes
it
discretionary.
in
other
words,
if
the
defendant
requests
a
presentence
report
and
that
presentence
report,
if
requested,
must
go
to
the
jury,
traditionally
presentence
reports
in
ohio
include
victim
impact-type
testimony.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
yes.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
no.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
there
are
categories
that
pertain
to
like
the
killing
of
a
peace
officer,
presidential
assassination,
governor
assassination,
but
nothing
else.
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
briefly
like
to
say
that
i
think
the
argument
made
by
the
respondent
illustrates
the
one-sided
focus
of
the
booth
regime.
we
keep
hearing
about
mrs.
harris'
testimony,
mr.
harris'
testimony,
and
no
one
in
the
court
below
recognized
the
invited
error
or
that
the
defense
had
done
the
exact
same
thing.
everything
that
the
state
asked
of
the
victim's
parents
in
this
questions
was
in
a
direct...
was
in
direct
rebuttal
or
was
the
exact
same
question
that
the
respondent's
lawyer
asked.
and
there
is
a
one-sidedness
under
the
booth
regime.
and
the
penalty
phase
has
truly
become
the
mitigation
phase
[inaudible].
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
that
is
one-sided.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
no,
i
don't...
i
would
not
go
that
far.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
because
the
state
has
recognized,
or
you...
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
right
to
rebut
that,
and
that's
what
the
state
did
here.
and
you
cannot
recognize
the
state's
right
to
rebuttal
and
then
chop
it
up,
and
call
that
equal
justice.
and
that's
what
i
am
arguing
about
here.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
well,
the
state
of
ohio
welcomes
that
burden.
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
and
that
is
fair,
and
that
is
a
proper
part
of--
mr.
jonathan
e.
rosenbaum
--but
in
this
burden
the
state
should...
in
meeting
its
burden
the
state
should
not
be
severely
handicapped.
the
state
should
be
able
to
meet
victim
impact
testimony
that
the
defense
can
put
on
in
mitigation
with
the
actual
harm
caused,
and
include
victims
in
our
system
of
justice.
thank
you.
