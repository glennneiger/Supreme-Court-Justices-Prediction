next
in

89-1944,
ohio
v.
ediberto
huertas.
the

are
admonished
the
court
remains
in
session.
there
will

no
talking
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
rosenbaum,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rosenbaum,
when
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
decided
this
case
and
said
that
the
testimony
of
the
lay
witness
was
not
admissible,
did
it
rely
on
any
ohio
cases
to
say
that
or
did
it
rely
on
the
united
states
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
this
case
tried
in
elyria?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rosenbaum.
ms.
bour-stokes,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
bour-stokes,
did
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
cite
state
against
jenkins?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
it...
i
said
did
it
cite?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
if
i
may.
in
a
case
decided
some
years
ago
by
this
court,
perkins
v.
bengay
consolidated
mining
co.,
written
by
justice
burton
who
was
another
ohioan,
of
course,
and
interested
in
the
ohio
syllabus
rule.
i
think
he
says
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
may
be
consulted
if
there
is
doubt
about
what
the
syllabus
means.
is
that
still
an
ohio
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
bour-stokes,
you
say
the
father's
opinion
testimony
is
improper
under
ohio
law.
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
did
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
cite
an
ohio
case
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
rather
strange?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
unique,
surely
that's
a
fortiori
strange,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
ms.
bour-stokes,
the
ohio
legislature
passed
a
statute
that
provided
that
they
were
not
to
be
admitted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can't
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
did
the
ohio
legislature
pass
a
statute
that
said
they
were
not
to
be
admitted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
bour-stokes.
mr.
rosenbaum,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenbaum.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

89-1944,

petitioner
verus

of

is
