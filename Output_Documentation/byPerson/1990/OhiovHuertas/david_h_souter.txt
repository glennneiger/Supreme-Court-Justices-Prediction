justice
souter
but
we
could
perfectly
well
affirm
without
doing
anything
one
way
or
the
other
to
booth
and
gathers,
couldn't
we?
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
but
all
you're
really
asking,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
we
adopt
a
rule,
a
kind
of
opening-the-door
rule,
so
that
if
the...
whatever
kind
of
evidence
on
mitigation
the
defense
puts
in,
you
should
be
allowed
to
counter
with
like
evidence.
isn't
that
all
you're
saying?
justice
souter
but
all
we
have
to
do
to
get
what
you
want
in
this
case
is
a
kind
of
opening-the-door
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
given
the
fact
that
there
is
an
ohio
legislation
authorizing
victim
impact
statements
in
these
cases,
what
stated
legislative
criterion
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
would
this...
would
the
evidence
be
addressed
to
if
it
were
admissible
as
you
want
it
to
be?
justice
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
further
question?
is
there
any
extant
ohio
legislation
right
now
to
which
this
kind
of
evidence
would
properly
be
addressed?
justice
souter
is
there,
is
there
a
statute
defining
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
souter
and
do...
are
there
categories
within
that
statute
to
which
the
testimony
you
want
to
come
in
would
properly
be
addressed--
justice
souter
--if...
under
the
present
law?
justice
souter
well,
it
may
have
been
irrelevant
in
the
abstract
under
some
criterion,
but
if
booth
and
gathers
didn't
necessarily
keep
it
out,
and
if
it
was
in
fact
addressed
to
testimony
of
a
like
character
from
the
other
side,
the
ohio
supreme
court
might
very
well
have
allowed
it
either
on
an
open
door
theory
or
as
harmless
evidence,
had
it
not
believed
that
booth
and
gathers
required
a
different
result.
isn't
that
true?
justice
souter
well,
let
me...
before
you
do
that,
let
me
just
go
back
to
my
question
on
one
point.
if
that
is
the
way
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
interpreted
the
record,
but
for
its
belief
that
booth
and
gathers
required
this
result,
the
ohio
supreme
court
might
have
come
out
the
other
way.
isn't
that
true?
justice
souter
you
mean
on
no
conceivable
understanding
of
the
facts
could
ohio
have
come
out
the
other
way
if
they
had
not
believed
that
booth
and
gathers
required
this
result?
justice
souter
you
certainly
don't
give
up
ground.
[laughter]
justice
souter
what
is
the
ohio
statutory
law
right
now
defining
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
souter
well,
the
ohio
supreme
court
could
have
reversed
on
that
ground
but
didn't.
i
mean,
that
isn't
the
issue
we
took
this
case
to
determine.
i
mean,
we...
the
ohio
supreme
court
decided
on
some
constitutional
ground,
not
on
the
ground
that
this
evidence
doesn't
go
to
any
aggravating
factor
that
ohio
law
allows.
justice
souter
oh,
but
we--
