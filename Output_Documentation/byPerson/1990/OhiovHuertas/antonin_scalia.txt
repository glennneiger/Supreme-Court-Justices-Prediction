justice
scalia
i
don't
understand.
i...
is
what
you're
saying
that,
without
booth
and
gathers,
the
ohio
supreme
court
could
have
found
it,
what,
harmless
error
or
invited
error,
but
because
of
booth
and
gathers
it
was
precluded
from
doing
that?
justice
scalia
is
that
the
point?
justice
scalia
mr.
rosenbaum,
what
do
we
know
now
that
we
didn't
know
when
we
decided
booth
that
would
justify
us
in
overruling
it?
justice
scalia
mr....
you
go
ahead.
what
protections
would
there
be
besides
your...
your
concession
that
opinion
evidence
of
relatives
should
not
be
allowed
in
as
to
what
the
penalty
ought
to
be?
don't
you
think
it's
rather
unfair
to
the
defendant
to
put
on
a
weeping
widow
or,
you
know,
a
bereaved
mother,
tears
streaming
down
her
face
in
front
of
the
jury?
what
protections
are
there
against
that
sort
of--
justice
scalia
you're
saying
the
syllabus
couldn't
be
wrong?
justice
scalia
well,
but
it
could
be
wrong.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that,
that
if
it
referred
to
a
federal
constitutional
right
it
was
in
error,
i
mean,
we
reverse
state
supreme
courts
now
and
then.
not
only
their
syllabus
but
their
entire
opinion
may
be
wrong.
it...
it's
thinkable,
at
least,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
but
the
point
is
simply
whether...
it
isn't
whether
it
goes
beyond
what
was
approved
in
booth
and
gathers.
it
certainly
does,
in
the
view
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
the
syllabus
is
taken
verbatim
from
a
sentence
in
the
opinion.
justice
scalia
and
that
sentence
is
followed
by
the
following,
as
if
in
explanation
of
why
they
had
said
that.
"we...
after
reviewing
the
arguments
presented,
we
find
no
grounds
on
which
to
distinguish
booth
and
gathers,
and
we
are
thus
compelled
to
follow
those
cases,
vacate
the
sentence
of
death,
and
remand
for
imposition
of
a
life
sentence
in
accord
with
penix,
supra.
"
we
are
compelled
by
booth
and
gathers
to
decide
this
case
the
way
we
decided
is
what
they're
saying.
now,
doesn't
that
explain
what
the
syllabus
means?
justice
scalia
when
it
refers
to
a
constitutional
determination?
justice
scalia
i
may
agree
with
that.
but
did
the
ohio
supreme
court
agree
with
it?
that
may
just
be
a
basis
for
reversing
them.
the
point
is
not
whether
it's
true,
but
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
thought
it
was
saying.
justice
scalia
what
was
the
second?
i'm
sorry.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
read
that
as
a
separate
conclusion.
i
read
that
as
an
explanation
of
the
prior
sentence.
"we
are
thus
compelled
to
follow
those
cases.
"
justice
scalia
is
that
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
referring
to?
that
statement?
i
didn't
get
from
its
opinion
that
that's
what
it
was
addressing.
i
thought
it
was
addressing
his...
his
live
testimony.
justice
scalia
yeah.
so
what
is...
what
does
the
other
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
scalia
not
the
error
the
supreme
court
was
relying
upon
to
reverse
this
case.
the
error
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
relying
upon
was
the
error
of
introducing
live
the
testimony
of
the
father.
justice
scalia
it
didn't
even
address
the
other
one.
justice
scalia
but
we're,
we're
addressing
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion,
and
the
question
is
whether
it
was...
whether
the
error
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion
found
was
invited.
justice
scalia
wait,
wait.
why
does
that
make
it
uninvited?
you
put
the
mother
on
the
stand,
that
doesn't
in...
what
if...
what
if
counsel
had
sought
to
cross-examine
the
mother?
could
the...
could
counsel
have
done
that?
the
mother
says
yes,
i
can,
as
a
christian
i
can
forgive
him.
could
counsel
for
the
state
come
in
and
say
now,
now
think
about
it.
i
mean,
you
know
you're
supposed
to
forgive
him,
but
do
you
really
forgive?
don't
you
really
think
this
person
did
a
horrible
thing
and
should
be
punished
for
it?
could
counsel
for
the...
for
the
state
have
asked
that
question?
justice
scalia
that...
that
wouldn't
have
been
invited
error
either?
justice
scalia
no.
so
the
defense
can
put
on
anything,
and
in
trying
to
reply
to
it,
it's
not
invited
error?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
shouldn't
have
been
put
in
then,
should
it?
justice
scalia
but
having
been
put
in,
if
the
judge
let
that
in,
why
wasn't
the
state
justified
in
thinking
the
judge
would
let
the
rebuttal
to
it
in?
justice
scalia
allows
it
to
be
admitted
or
compels
it
to
be
admitted
if
offered?
justice
scalia
it's
up
to
the
judge,
but
the
judge
can
say
i
don't
allow
victim
impact
statements?
does
it--
justice
scalia
--is
that
right?
the
judge
can
say,
even
though
there's
a
statute
on
it,
the
judge
can
say
i
know
the
state
says
it's
admissible,
but
that
just
means
it
may
be
admitted,
i
can
keep
it
out?
justice
scalia
see,
i
thought
the
statute
was
compulsory,
and
all
the
state
did
was
decline
to
make
it
mandatory
for
capital
cases,
but
without
saying
whether
it
was
admissible.
justice
scalia
--we
only
look
to
the
syllabus.
[laughter]
