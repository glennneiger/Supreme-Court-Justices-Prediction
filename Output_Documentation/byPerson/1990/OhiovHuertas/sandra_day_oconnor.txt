justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
rosenbaum,
did
either
booth
or
gathers
involve
testimony
of
the
witness
as
to
what
the
penalty
should
be
in
the
case?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
quite
different,
a
different
kind
of
evidence
in
those
cases.
justice
o'connor
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
ohio
syllabus
here
was
focusing
on
a
somewhat
different
point,
to
whit,
the
recommendation
of
the
penalty
and
nothing
more.
justice
o'connor
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
ohio
is
opinion
evidence
on
the
penalty
in
a
criminal
case
admissible
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
can
just
answer
the
question.
justice
o'connor
in
determining
whether
a
defendant
is
guilty
or
innocent
in
a
criminal
case
in
ohio,
lay
witness
opinion
as
to
the
penalty
is
considered
relevant?
justice
o'connor
are
there
ohio
cases
holding
that
lay
witness
opinion
evidence
is
relevant
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
case?
justice
o'connor
thank
you.
