ms.
joann
bour-stokes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
stating
this
morning
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
base
its
holding
on
the
improper
opinion
testimony
of
the
father
in
this
case,
and
it
seems
that
my
opponent
this
morning
has
conceded
that
there
was
error
in
allowing
the
father's
testimony.
to
support
my
position
i
would
first
like
to
start
by
the
proposition
of
ohio
law
that
what
is
stated
in
the
syllabus
is
the
law
of
the
case,
and
any
conclusions
in
the
opinion
that
are
not
carried
forward
into
the
syllabus
do
not
constitute
the
law
of
the
case.
so
if
one
looks
at
the
syllabus
in
this
case,
it
only
concerns
the
father's
testimony.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
is
a
very
unique
rule
to
ohio,
and
the
way
the
ohio
supreme
court
interprets
its
own
opinions.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
and
it's
very
important
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
also
respond
to--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
right
referred
to
in
the
syllabus
cannot
be
a
federal
constitutional
right,
first
because
it
talks
about
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
and
judge
decision.
this
court
has
recognized
in
spaziano
v.
florida
that
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
decision
in
capital
case.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
recognized
that
long
before
this
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
i'm...
no,
no,
i
don't
believe
a
syllabus
is
wrong.
it
comports
entirely
with--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--i
think
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
decided
in
this
case
is
entirely
correct,
that
the
opinion
testimony
was
improper
in
this
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
no...
it's
not,
your
honor.
and
if
you
look
at
the
opinion--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
and
what
the
court
did
was,
in--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--it
did...
yes,
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
discussed
booth
and
gathers
in
the
context
of
mrs.
harris'
testimony,
and
her
improper
testimony.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
um-hum.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
no,
your
honor.
the
only
federal
constitution
decisions
they
cite
are
booth
and
gathers.
and
the
principles
from
booth
and
gathers
cannot
be--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--right.
the
constitutional
rights
from
booth
and
gathers
cannot
be
the
constitutional
rights
that
control
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion
in
this
case,
because
those
were
the
eighth
amendment
principles
this
court
enunciated
in
booth
and
gathers
about
the
distortion
of
evidence
and
the
emotional
impact
of
the
crime
on
the
family.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
there
is
no
specific
provision,
your
honor.
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
early
on
in
its
jurisprudence
was
recognize
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
ohio
in
a
state
case,
under
the
sixth--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--yes,
your
honor.
under
the
specific
provision
that
you're
entitled
to
an
impartial
trial
by
jury.
and
the--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is
an
ohio
constitutional
provision.
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
also
did
was
recognize
there
is
also
a
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
in
a
capital
case
in
ohio.
and
those
two
provisions
combined
are
what
controls
in
this
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
i
cited
state
v.
jenkins,
your
honor,
which
is
the
important
case,
and
it
is
cited
in
my
brief
in
a
footnote,
and
is
in
the
table
of
authorities.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
what
it...
it
interprets
an
ohio
statutory
provision
about
the
right
to
jury
trial.
and
i
infer
from
that
decision
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
felt
that
there
was
a
state
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no,
your
honor,
but
what
happens
then
later
on
is
the
ohio
supreme
court
recognizes
that
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial,
in
a
case
called
state
v.
rogers,
and
since
that
time
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
ohio.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
it
could
have
cited
state
against
jenkins--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--oh,
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it
did
not
cite
state
v.
jenkins.
the
only
ohio
principles
that
the
court
cited
was,
early
in
its
discussion,
it
cited
state
v.
post
dealing
with
the
victim
impact
evidence.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
and
what's
important
to
support
my
argument
today
is
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion
was
structured
in
this
case,
it
set
forth
clearly
what
the
court
was
going
to
address.
the
first
four
arguments
dealt
with
mrs.
harris'
testimony,
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
state
that
the
father's
opinion
testimony
in
this
case
went
beyond
anything
considered
by
this
court
in
booth
and
gathers.
so
the
court
was
drawing
a
distinction
between
what
this
court
set
out
in
booth
and
gathers
and
the
fact
that
the
father's
opinion
testimony
in
this
case
was
improper.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
no,
it
does
not,
your--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
first
of
all
because,
as
i
have
explained,
the
constitutional
principles
from
booth
and
gathers
do
not
concern
the
constitutional
right
to
have
your
capital
sentencing
decision
made
by
a
jury
or
by
a
judge.
second
of--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--second,
if
there
is
a
conclusion
in
the
opinion
that
is
not
carried
forward
to
the
syllabus
in
ohio,
that
does
not
constitute
the
law
of
the
case,
and
that's
the
ohio
supreme
court's
reading
of
its
own
structure
of
its
opinions.
third,
this--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--if
there
is
a
conclusion
in
the
text
of
the
opinion
that
is
not
carried
forth
into
the
syllabus,
it
does
not
constitute
the
law
of
the
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
i
read
as
a
very...
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
read
as
a
very
separate
conclusion
because
the
court
is
referring
to
all
of
the
arguments
advanced
in
this
case
dealing
with
mr.
and
mrs.
harris'
testimony,
and
this
concluding
paragraph
comes
at
the
conclusion
of
all
of
those
sections.
and
the
reference
to
booth
and
gathers
specifically
refers
to
their
analysis
of
mrs.
harris'
testimony.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
concluded
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
father's
opinion
testimony
in
this
case
was
not
relevant
to
any
of
the
decisions
the
jury
had
to
make
in
this
case.
it
provided
no
factual
information,
and
it
impeded
on
the
jury's
decision
in
this
case
to
determine
what
the
appropriate
sentence
was.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all
i
would
like
to
dispel
the
notion
that
this
was
in
any
way
invited
error
by
defense
counsel.
the
chronology
of
events
is
very
important.
the
father's--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
this--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
ohio
supreme
court's
analysis
was
very
distinct
from
that,
and
even
if
this--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--and
even
if
this
court
were
to
overrule
booth
and
gathers,
the
result
in
this
case
would
not
change.
the
father's
opinion
testimony
is
still
improper
under
ohio
law.
and
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
address
the
invited
error
doctrine
raised
by--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
it
did
not
cite
an
ohio
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
i
wouldn't
say
it's
strange.
it's
unique
in
this
case
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
not
cite--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--i
will
be
willing
to
admit
that
it
could
be
very
strange
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
they
did
not
cite
an
ohio
supreme
court
opinion.
but
that
does
not
necessary
lead
to
the
conclusion
then
that
the
decision
was
not
based
upon
state
law
grounds,
because
before
the
decision
in
this
case
was
rendered
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
already
found
that
opinion
testimony
in
the
ultimate
issue
that's
not
helpful
to
the
trier
of
fact
is
not
admissible
in
a
case,
and
this...
and
this
decision
comports
with
that
ruling.
in
addressing
the
invited
error
doctrine,
the
father's
testimony
was
before
the
jury
in
this
case,
or
was
admitted
before
the
parents
ever
took
the
stand.
the
presentence
investigation
report
was
admitted
into
evidence
at
the
state's
request
before
mr.
and
mrs.
harris
took
the
stand.
contained
within
the
presentence
investigation
report
was
a
victim
impact
statement.
in
that
victim
impact
statement
the
father
flatly
stated
that
mr.
huertas
should
receive
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
in
this
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
address
the
live
testimony,
your
honor.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
my
argument
this
morning
is
that
in
no
way
was
the
question
posed
to
mrs.
harris
somehow
invited
error
by
defense
counsel,
because
the
error
occurred
before
mrs.
harris
ever
took
the
stand
in
this
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
that's--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
my
argument
this
morning
is
not
addressed
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion,
but
to
the
argument
raised
by
the
state
of
ohio
that
somehow
this
was
invited
error.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
and...
no,
it
could
not
have
been
invited,
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
presentence
investigation
report
was
admitted,
and
the
fact
that
the
ohio
supreme
court--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no.
under
the
ruling
of
this
case,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
entirely
inappropriate.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
no,
your
honor.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
but
the
problem--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
mrs.
harris'
testimony
was
not
relevant
to
any
sort
of
rebuttal
of
the
defense
evident...
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
so
concluded
in
this
case
that
it
was
not
proper
rebuttal.
that
mrs.
harris'
testimony
was
irrelevant
from
the
outset.
she
had
nothing
to
offer
under
ohio
law
that
was
pertinent
to
the
penalty
phase.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
mrs.
harris
was--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
since
defense
counsel
already
knew
that
the
evidence
was
before
the
jury
because
the
vis
was
admitted
before
they
ever
took
the
stand,
defense
counsel
had
an
indication
from
the
trial
court
that
this
type
of
evidence
was
going
to
be
relevant
in
his
courtroom.
so
what
progressed
with
mr.
and
mrs.
harris'
testimony,
i
think,
was
in
direct
response
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
felt
the
psi
and
the
vis
in
this
case
was
permissible
under
ohio
law,
which
it
is
not.
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
address
the
victim
impact
statement
and
the
issue
raised
about
what
ohio
law
allows
along
the
lines
of
victim
impact
statement.
since
1968
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
held
that
victim
impact
evidence
is
not
allowable
under
ohio
law.
and
the
ohio
legislature
also
has
made
a
specific
finding
that
victim
impact
statements
are
not
allowable
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
capital
case.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
what
happened,
your
honor,
was--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--yes,
your
honor,
and
in
order
to
conclude
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
that
went
along
with
the
statute.
as
the
bill
was
originally
introduced
into
the
ohio
legislature
it
included
capital
murder.
after
discussions,
floor
debate,
that
specific
provision
covering
capital
murder
was
taken
out
of
the
statute,
and
the
statute
was
passed
without
capital
murder
being
included.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
that's
correct,
your
honor,
allowed
victim
impact
testimony
in
noncapital
cases.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
allows
it
to
be
admitted
should
the
victim's
family
wish
to
make
a
statement
or--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
first
of
all,
there
are
three
statutes
that--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
read
the
statute
that
way
at
all.
there
are
three
statutes
in
ohio
that
cover
victim
impact.
two
of
them
provide
that
if
the
victim's
family
wishes,
it
may
make
a
statement
at
a
plea
hearing
or
at
trial.
the
third
section
covers
when
a
victim
impact
statement
shall
be
considered
by
the
trial
court,
and
those
are
very
limited
circumstancing...
when
imposing...
deciding
what
the
minimum
term
should
be
for
an
indefinite
felony,
and
deciding
what
a
fine
should
be.
so
in
only
those
two
cases
in
ohio
is
it
mandatory
that
the
trial
court
consider
victim
impact
information.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
another
capital
case
has
already
concluded
that
that
statute
does
not
cover
capital
cases,
and
victim
impact
evidence
cannot
be
admitted
under
that
statute.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
there
is
a
specific
statute
in
ohio,
your
honor,
that
lists...
enumerates
eight
specific
aggravating
circumstances.
the
type
of
evidence
at
issue
in
this
case
today
does
not
fall
within
any
of
those
aggravating
circumstances.
and
it's
also
important
to
know
that
in
ohio
nonstatutory
aggravating
circumstances
may
not
be
admitted
at
the
penalty
phase.
so
if
the
evidence
does
not
constitute
an
aggravating
circumstance
or
a
mitigating
factor,
it
is
not
relevant
under
ohio
law.
and
no
argument
can
be
made
before
this
court
today
that
the
testimony
in
this
case,
either
mr.
or
mrs.
harris'
testimony,
was
somehow
relevant
to
ohio's
capital
statutory
scheme,
because
it's
not.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
no,
your
honor.
but
in
its
opinion
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
discuss
the
jury's
constitutional
obligation
to
weigh
the
aggravating
circumstances--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--and
the
mitigating
factors.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
but
if
there's
some
confusion
in
this
court
about
what
constitutional
right
means
and
what
the
court
meant
by
its
syllabus,
then
this
court
can
go
into
the
text.
and
if
this
court
looks
at
the
text
and
looks
at
the
analysis
the
court
used,
it
did
rely
on
the
jury's
obligation
to
weigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
mitigating
factors,
and
that
this
evidence
somehow
impinged
on
that
obligation
and
was
impermissible
under
ohio
law.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
respectfully
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
thank
you.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
booth
and
gathers...
this
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
a
booth
and
gathers
analysis
because
of
the
fact
that
ohio
law
prohibits
the
introduction
of
victim
impact
statements.
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
if
the
ohio
supreme
court
determines
that
under
ohio
law
that
constitutionally
can't
be
admitted--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--if
this
court
were
to
reach
the
booth
and
gathers
issue
and
decide...
and
overrule
booth
and
gathers,
the
result
in
this
case
would
not
change
for
two
reasons.
first,
because--
ms.
joann
bour-stokes
--oh,
i
absolutely
care,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
would
prefer
that
this
court
not
overrule
booth
and
gathers,
and
i
think,
for
all
the
reasons
that
have
been
advanced
to
this
court
before
and
the
policy
considerations.
those
cases
were
properly
decided
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
should
stay
in
force.
my
argument
this
morning
is
this
case
does
not
give
this
court
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
adjudicate
the
propriety
of
the
booth
and
gathers
decisions,
(a)
because
of
the
improper
opinion
testimony
of
the
father
in
this
case,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
ohio
law
prohibits
the
introduction
of
victim
impact
evidence.
thank
you.
