mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view
the
court's
decisions,
and
imbler
against
packman
in
particular,
suggest
that
absolute
immunity
shields
those...
shields
the
performance
of
those
prosecutorial
functions
that
directly
affect
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
judicial
process.
those
are
the
functions
that...
excuse
me,
that's
the
concern
that's
the
driving
force
behind
the
court's
recognition
of
absolute
immunity
in
this
area
of
the
law.
here
the
challenged
prosecutorial
activities;
giving
advice
to
the
police
officers
about
the
conduct
of
their
investigation
and
later
participating
in
the
judicial
proceeding
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
are
integral
to
the
prosecutorial
functions
that
do
directly
implicate
the
judicial
process.
those
well-recognized
functions
are
(1)
screening
cases
that
lead
to
the
formal
charging
decision,
and
secondly,
the
prosecutor's
duty
to
make
sure
that
the
criminal
justice
process
is
always
fair.
exposing
such
conduct
to
the
threat
and
intimidation
of
civil
litigation
would
inevitably
impair
the
judicial
process.
there
are
other
alternatives,
remedies,
short
of
a
civil
damages
action...
excuse
me...
to
take
care
of
a
prosecutor's
misconduct.
in
these
circumstances
we
submit
the
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
in
that
situation,
justice
white,
rare
as
it
may
be
at
least
in
the
federal
practice...
it
doesn't
matter
where
the
prosecutor
is,
whether
he's
on
the
phone
in
his
office
or
at
the
scene,
although
it's
a
bad
practice
for
the
prosecutor
to
be
on
the
scene
because
he
could
become
a
witness,
which
is
something
you
don't
want.
but
to
contrast
that
situation--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
but
if
he's
on
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
but
if
he's
on
the
search
scene,
and
there
are
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
prosecutor
is
participating
in
the
search.
he's
with
the
investigators
rummaging
through
the
house
to
look
for
the
evidence.
then
we
submit
that's
a
much
more
difficult
case
to
say
that
he's
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
because
he
is
functioning
not
so
much...
he's
not
functioning
as
a
prosecutor--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--we...
our
submission
here
is
not
that
anyone
who
gives
legal
advice--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--because
that
person--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it's,
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
person,
the
legal
advice
giver
in
your
hypothetical
who's
not
a
prosecutor
isn't
functioning
the
system
the
way
a
prosecutor
does.
that's
not
his
job.
he's
not
thinking
in
terms
of,
well,
if
i
give
him
the
right
advice,
am
i
going
to
be
able
to
make
a
case
out
of
this?
is
this
going
to
lead
to
evidentiary
problems?
is
this
the
kind
of
case
we
want
to
bring?
and
that's
the
distinction
between
the
prosecutor
and,
for
example,
if...
at
least
in
the
federal
system...
all
the
investigative
agencies
have--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--i
wouldn't
say
it's
a
major
difference,
justice
white,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
we
would,
we
would
pause
before
we
would
want
the
court
to
clothe
absolute
immunity
to
that
person
as
opposed
to
a
prosecutor
and
the
distinction
is...
and
it's
what
imbler
against
packman
suggests.
it's
what
this
court
even
recognized
in
butz
and
economou.
it's
got
to
be
not
just
the
person's
hat
or
whether
he
has
a
law
degree.
it's
what
his
role
is
in
the
overall
process
and
in
this...
in
the
case
before
the
court,
the
reason
why
giving
legal
advice
is,
so
to
speak,
intimately
connected
with
the
judicial
process
in
the
words
of
imbler
is
that
when
the
prosecutor
gives
that
advice,
he's
giving
it
in
the
context
of
making
a
case,
presenting
the
charging
decision.
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
make
the
charging
decision,
which
all
agree
must
be
protected
from
absolute...
from
suit
by
absolute
immunity.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
the
unfortunate
or
as
was
pointed
out
before,
one
apparent
anomaly
is
that
the
police
officer
goes
to
the
prosecutor
and
says...
one
hypothetical
would
be...
can
i
beat
this
person
up
to
get
a
confession?
and
the
stupid
prosecutor,
the
incompetent
prosecutor
says,
i
think
that's
constitutional.
there's
no
doubt
that
and
our
submission
the
prosecution--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
it
doesn't...
in
our
submission
the
prosecutor
is
scot-free.
the
policeman
can
only
claim
qualified
immunity
and
in
those
circumstances
i
submit
he
would
probably
have
a
tough
time
claiming
qualified
immunity
because
of...
his
state
of
mind
isn't
relevant.
it's
whether
a
reasonable
police
officer
would
know
that
he
could
engage
in
this
conduct
and
i
submit
he
would
have
a
tough
time
making
that
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
justice
stevens,
in
our
brief
we
made
three
points
on
this
particular
question.
one,
in
anderson
against
creighton
the
court
made
clear
that
the
common
law
analog
isn't
the
end
of
the
case.
second,
at
common
law
in
the
18th,
19th,
and
17th
centuries,
this
particular
function
wasn't
entrenched
in
the
public
prosecutor's
office.
it's
a
modern
development.
and
third--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it
does
to
a
certain
extent,
but
to
the
extent
that
we
look
for
a
common
law
analog...
this
goes
back
to
my
point
before.
in
the
context
of
giving
legal
advice,
it's
he's
thinking
about
the
charging
decision.
it
could
be
considered
a
form
of
malicious
prosecution
which
is
really
what
this
case
is...
at
least
from
the
plaintiff's
standpoint...
is
all
about
and
of
course
as
imbler
recognized,
a
prosecutor
was
absolutely
immune
at
common
law
for
that.
and
finally
this
was
not
in
our
brief
but
it
was
mentioned
before.
given
the
privity
requirements
at
common
law,
this
wouldn't...
this
suit
wouldn't
arise,
because
a
third
party
couldn't
sue
the
lawyer
for
giving
him
legal
advice.
and
so
the
reason
why
there
may
not
be
any
cases
showing
absolute
immunity
for
this
particular
set
of
circumstances,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
at
common
law.
and
so
we
think
that
for
those
reasons
the
fact
that
we
can't
give
you
a
case--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it
is...
it's
at
least
on
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
at
common
law,
of
course,
today,
the
privity
rules
have
changed--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--and
there
are
suits
where
people
sue
lawyers.
and
in
terms
of
this
particular
suit,
it
is
strange
in
terms
of
the
legal
advice,
at
least
with
the
hypnosis,
that
it
was
not
decided
on
qualified
immunity
grounds.
but
even...
but
of
course
respondent
didn't
make
that
argument
to
the
court
at
the
petition
stage
and
the
case
comes
before
you
presenting
the
issue
that
has
bothered
the
lower
courts
of
whether
legal
advice
as
such...
it
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
in
some
respects--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that's,
that's
one
of
the
offshoots
of
our
submission,
that
the
reason
why
we
believe
that
absolute
immunity
is
necessary
is
to
keep
the
prosecutors
in
the
wheel,
in
the
decision
making,
to
have
them
available,
so
they
can--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--in
looking
at
individual
cases,
there's
no
doubt
that
you
don't,
you
wouldn't
think
that
you
need
this
absolute
protection,
but
the
point
of
the
doctrine,
and
this
court
has
recognized
this
in
imbler
and
other
cases,
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
broader
category
of
cases.
you
just
don't
want...
yes,
you
are
going
to
have
the
incompetent,
lousy
prosecutors
getting
off,
but
at
the
expense
of
having
otherwise
honest,
hard-working
correct
prosecutors
not
being
subject
to
the
harassment
of
suit.
and
we
submit
that
is,
that's
the
calculus
in
any
given
case.
it's
outrageous
what
happens,
what
might
happen
to
a
particular
plaintiff,
but
you
can't
throw
out
the
baby
with
the
bath
water.
and
we
submit
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i
can't
stand
before
the
court
and
say
that
which
ever
way
this
case
comes
out,
the
federal
prosecutor
is
no
longer
going
to
answer
the
phone
and
give
advice.
they're
duty
bound
by
department
regulation
and
by
ethical
rules
to
give
advice.
but
people
are
people
and
the
concern
is
that
subjecting
prosecutors
to
the
harassment
of
this
litigation
in
the
broad
category
of
cases
will
undermine
the
system
itself.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
there
are
reported
cases,
there
may
be
several
dozen
if
that
many.
thank
you.
