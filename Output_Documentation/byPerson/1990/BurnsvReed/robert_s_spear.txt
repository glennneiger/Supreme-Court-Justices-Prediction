mr.
robert
s.
spear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
pure
legal
issue
concerning
and
regarding
legal
advice
given
to
police
concerning
hypnosis,
legal
advice
given
to
police
officers
concerning
probable
cause
due
arrest
and
asking
questions
of
a
police
officer
in
court
seeking
a
search
warrant.
the
issue
is
are
these
prosecutorial
functions
protected
by
absolute
immunity
from
civil
liability
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983?
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
in
indiana
we...
it
is
by
definition
of
common
law
and
historical
custom
to
practice
if
they
are.
but
like
illinois,
which
is
in
the
same
circuit,
the
indiana
prosecuting
attorney
is
almost
a
second
cousin
to
the
state's
attorney
in
illinois
where
giving
legal
advice
to
police
is
in
fact
a
statutory
obligation.
but
giving
legal
advice
to
police
and
conducting
search
warrant
hearings
or
also
asking
questions
at
search
warrant
hearings
is
a
traditional
function
in
indiana
prosecution.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
no,
justice,
it
is
not
covered
by
statute.
the
statutory
duties
of
the
indiana
prosecutor
are
confined
to
one
or
two
simple
statutes--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--only
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
the
packman
itself
discusses
griffith
v.
slinkard,
which
is
the
text
on
common
law
case
we
rely
on
and
later
on
we
see
foster
v.
pearcy
in
indiana
in
the
1970's
dealing
with
a
wide-ranging
deal,
a
wide-ranging
variety
of
prosecutorial
duties.
but
those
particularized
functions
are
not
statutory.
they
are
common
law
and
historically
based.
as
a
practical
matter,
indiana
has
92
counties
and
many
of
them
are
very
small,
so
that
in
terms
of
giving
legal
advice
to
the
police
as
a
practical
matter
if
they
do
not
get
legal
advice
from
the
prosecuting
attorney,
they
do
not
give
legal
advice
at
all.
county
attorneys
and
city
attorneys,
except
in
a
very
major
urban
area,
would
ordinarily
not
be
giving
legal
advice
on
criminal
cases
to
the
local
police.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
almost
always,
justice.
the...
there
are
two
methods
for
instance
in
search
warrants
which
would
be
either
prior
to
or
after
filing
of
formal
charges
in
indiana.
one
is
to
ask
questions
in
open
court
and
then
obtain
the
warrant,
usually
drafted
by
a
prosecutor,
but
signed
by
a
judge
after
amendment
or
on
its
face.
the
other
question
would
be
a
preparation
of
an
affidavit
signed
by
the
charging
witness,
usually
an
officer
in
preparation
of
a
warrant
which
would
then
be
signed
by
a
judge
or...
as
amended
or
on
its
face
if
finding
is
probable
cause.
under
either
of
those
circumstances,
the
prosecutor
would
be
imminently
involved
in
it
and
it's...
in
fact
in
terms
of
asking
questions
in
open
court
in
indiana,
only
a
lawyer
can
ask
questions
of
a
witness
in
open
court,
so
that
the
officer,
if
they
did
not
go
in
alone,
could
not
have
another
person
ask
these
questions
unless
they
were
an
attorney.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
only
available
attorney
would
be
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
one
of
his
or
her
deputies.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
justice,
this
is
a
local
custom
and
practice
rather
than
state
law
but
absolutely
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
that
is
a
cutting
edge
of
the
question,
whether
that
immunity
would
apply
in
that
situation,
justice,
and
i
would
believe
that
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
it
was
an
integral
part
of
their
duties
under
state
law,
whether
that
be
statutory
law--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--under
those
circumstances,
if
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
what
a
prosecuting
attorney
does
in
most
cases,
yes--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--otherwise,
no.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
only
in
a
limited
circumstance
where
it
was
an
integral
part
of
his
duties.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
it
would
not
be
a
wide-ranging
thing.
a
police
officer
could
not
bring
a
private
attorney
in
and
have
him
ask
questions
and
hope
for
that
immunity.
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
some
question
and
that's
the
circumstance
of
whether
they're
state
actions
as
well.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
the
question
comes
about--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--whether
or
not
it's
an
integral
part
of
the
judicial
process
we
would
submit
is
the
answer
to
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we
would
submit
that
it
is.
that
in
fact
as
early
as
possible
in
a
criminal
investigation
of
prosecution,
the
police
for
public
policy
reasons
should
have
access
to
legal
advice,
and
for
two
reasons.
one
is
to
protect
the
innocent
and
to
protect
people's
constitutional
rights,
because
hopefully
an
attorney,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
gives
better
legal
advice
than
a
squad
sergeant.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--most
lawyers,
justice,
are
not
subject
to
the
kind
of
litigation
from
1983
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
i
would
submit,
justice,
that
in
the
hurly-burly
of
the
criminal
justice
system
that,
that
police
officers,
judges,
and
prosecuting
attorneys
draw
far
many
more
lawsuits
than
the
average
member
of
the
bar.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
only
a
prosecuting
attorney
or
his
deputies
who
are
members
of
the
bar,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
only
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
his
deputies
who
are
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
if
they
are
lawyers.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
for
the
facts
in
this
case
and
for
those
key
prosecutorial
functions
under
imbler,
justice,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
no,
it
relates
to
the
function
and
not
simply
because
he's
the
prosecuting
attorney,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
i
would
submit,
justice,
that
in
this
particular
instance
it's
not
necessarily
policy
making
but
the
choice
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--i
would
submit,
justice,
that
they
deal
in
a
criminal
justice
context
simply
with
a
judge
and
prosecutor
context,
as
opposed
to
for
instance
the
absolute
immunity
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
which
is,
which
is
a
policy
making
question.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
i
would
suggest--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--not
necessarily,
justice,
because
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--justice,
i
would
think
not,
simply
because
in
a
courtroom
whether
you
are
the
prosecutor
or
the
deputy
prosecutor,
you
are
the
state
of
indiana
when
you
bring
an
action.
in
this
particular
case,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
mr.
reed
engaged
in
a
prosecutorial
function
by
giving
legal
advice
and
asking
questions
in
court
of
a
police
officer
and
in
key
here,
the
prosecutor
did
not
manage
or
participate
in
police
investigative
activities.
this
court
in
imbler
v.
packman
held
that
a
prosecuting
attorney
has
absolute
immunity
in
performing
duties
which
are
an
integral
part
of
the
judicial
process
in
order
to
protect
the
prosecutor
from
harassment
and
intimidation.
historically,
imbler
cites
griffith
v.
slinkard,
an
1896
indiana
case,
dealing
with
granting
legal
advice
to
grand
juries
and
indeed
granting
legal...
giving
legal
advice
to
grand
juries,
allegedly
adding
a
name
to
an
indictment,
allegedly
suborning
perjury
of
witnesses
in
front
of
a
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
well,
do
you
think
that's
an
accurate
description
of
what
you're
urging
us
to
accept?
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process?
yes,
justice,
because
we
disagree
strongly
with
petitioner
that
there
is
a
bright-line
test
which
this
court
can
apply
overall
to
determine
where
imbler
applies.
we
wold
submit
that
the
imbler
teaching
is
that
you
must
apply
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
that
there
will
be
tough
questions
for
the
courts
to
make
and
that
there
is
no
bright-line
one
way
or
another.
and
we
are
submitting
not
that
this
court
extend
imbler
but
apply
it
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
there
are
three
specific
situations,
giving
legal
advice
on
hypnosis,
giving
legal
advice
concerning
probable
cause,
and
asking
questions
in
open
court
on
a
search
warrant
hearing,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
do
no
more
than
apply
imbler
to
those
facts
and
not
to
create...
to
extend
imbler,
but
merely
to
apply
it
herein.
we
think
imbler
answers
the
questions
that
this
case
brought
up.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
certainly,
justice,
it
did
not
decide
the
specific
issues
in
this
case,
but
it
gave
us
the
teachings
to
apply
to
a
fact
situation
and
reach
a
result
which
we
believe
that
the
circuits
and
the
district
courts
have
over
the
years.
now
there
is
admittedly
a
split
in
the
circuit...
in
the
circuits
on
legal
advice;
the
seventh,
eighth,
and
eleventh,
find
absolute
immunity,
the
tenth
definitively
does
not.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
similar
situation
because
this
prosecuting
attorney
did
not
appear
in
court
as
a
witness,
justice.
he
appeared
to
ask
questions.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
this
is
a
function
that
he
would
be
doing
in
a
trial
situation.
he
would
also
be--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--yes,
justice,
it
certainly
is.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we
believe
those
two
are
almost
identical
questions
where
his
asking
questions
in
court
is
a
separate
question,
justice.
that
would
be
our
submission.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we
would
submit,
justice,
that
if
the...
the
prosecuting
attorney
by
analogy
does
exactly
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
a
grand
jury
that
he
or
she
does
in
this
case.
they
give
legal
advice
to
grand
juries.
in
indiana
they
call
the
grand
jury
to
give
legal
advice
to
the
grand
jury,
ask
questions
of
witnesses
before
grand
juries.
we
believe
that
is
a
very
direct
analogy
to
what
this
prosecuting
attorney...
prosecuting
attorney
did,
which
is
give
legal
advice
to
the
police,
and
furthermore,
then
proceeded
to
ask
questions
in
open
court
before
a
judge.
and
we
think
the
analogy
is
very
direct,
because
this
prosecutor
did
not
engage
in
what
we
think
is
investigative
conduct.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
i'm
not
sure
the
policeman
can't
be
held
liable,
justice.
in
malley
v.
briggs
for
instance,
the
magistrate
was
clearly
absolutely
immune
who
issued
the
warrant
and
yet
the
officer
who
testified
and
asked
for
the
warrant
was
found
to
be
not
immune.
under
those
circumstances,
there
is...
the
qualified
immunity
would
apply
but
on
a
particular
fact
situation
it
may
not
protect
the
officer.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
the,
the
doctrine
of
absolute
judicial
immunity,
prosecutorial
immunity,
justice,
is
not
to
protect
the
individuals.
it's
to
protect
the
system.
it
is
inconceivable
there
would
be
such
a
doctrine
if
there
weren't
public
policy
grounds
to
protect
the
system
as
a
whole
as
is
opposed
to
individuals
and
i
think
that
makes
the
difference.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
in
griffith
v.
slinkard,
which
is
the
indiana
case--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--i
would
suggest
that
giving
advice
to
a
grand
jury
is
a
legal
advice
case,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
he
did,
but
he
also
asked
what...
allegedly
suborned
perjury
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
and
allegedly...
and
gave
legal
advice
to
the
grand
jury
as
well.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
in
terms
of--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--no,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we
believe
so,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we
obviously
would
disagree
with
petitioner
about
that,
but
we
believe
he
would.
we
think
that
the
abstract
proposition
whether
or
not
you
can
hypnotize
someone
is
something
which
he
could
have
said...
obtained
qualified
immunity
on,
giving
legal
advice
on
probable
cause
would
also
fit
that
category.
and
that
we
also
believe
that
objectively
since
in
any...
there
is
an
indiana
case
that
says
that
hypnosis
can
provide
probable
cause
although
not
used
as
evidence,
that
each
of
those
three
situations
would
have
produced
summary
judgment
under--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--we
would
submit,
justice,
that
the
record
shows
that
he
asked
the
officer
questions.
he
asked
them
if
there
was
anything
else
he
wanted
to
say,
to
which
he
responded
no.
and
in
gentry
v.
state
in
indiana,
it
is
irrelevant
where
it
was
under
hypnosis
or
not,
because
for
probable
cause
purposes
the
confession,
properly
given
hypnosis,
would
have
produced
probable
cause
in
either
event
whether
it
was
under
hypnosis
or
not.
and
there
was
no
clear-cut
law
that
said
you
couldn't
do
it.
subsequent
case
law
said
you
could.
at
common
law
we
would
submit,
however,
that
a
cannot
sue
b's
lawyer
for
legal
advice,
even
bad
legal
advice,
that
b's
lawyer
gives
b.
we
would
submit
the
same
situation
is
true
here.
it's
not
a
prosecutorial
case.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
but
there
is
a
common
law
principle
involved
here.
it
is
related
but
not
on
all
fours.
in
this
case
reed
did
not
participate
in
the
interrogation.
he
did
not
make
an
arrest.
we
would
submit
prosecutors
should
be
encouraged
to
give
police
legal
advice
in
the
building
and
screening
of
cases
as
early
as
possible.
in
indiana
it
is
a
historical
custom
and
practice
for
prosecutors
to
appear
at
search
warrant
hearings
and
again,
only
an
attorney
can
ask
questions
in
indiana
court.
this
prosecutor
was
neither
an
affiant
nor
a
witness
in
that
hearing.
we
believe
asking
questions
of
importance
is
imminently
associated
with
a
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
proceedings
and
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
the
prosecutorial
analysis
approach
is
a
determination
of
whether
prosecutor
activities
have
been
a
judicial
phase
of
criminal
process
including
initiating
the
process.
if
so,
the
prosecutor
is
absolutely
immune
from
civil
liability.
on
performing
this
historical
function
in
a
criminal
case
the
prosecution
got
the
same
immunity
as
judges.
public
policy
requires
the
criminal
justice
system
be
allowed
to
protect
the
innocent
and
pursue
the
guilty.
here
we
would
ask
the
court
to
apply
imbler
v.
packman.
the
prosecutor
should
be
afforded
absolute
civil
immunity
any
time
he
or
she
functions
as
a
prosecuting
attorney
either
in
court
or
giving
legal
advice.
in
other
words,
the
seventh
circuit
be
affirmed.
