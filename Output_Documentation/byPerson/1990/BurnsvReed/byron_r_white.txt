justice
white
you
are
not
say
to
[inaudible],
just
an
opportunity.
justice
white
well,
what
about...
well,
maybe
that's
because
prosecutors
don't
give
advice
in
those
circuits.
justice
white
well,
i
mean
they're
probably
obeying...
they're
probably
avoiding
a
risk.
justice
white
do
you
think
qualified
immunity
is
enough?
justice
white
what...
why
should
anyone,
judge
or
prosecutor
at
his
core
functions,
why
should
he
have
absolute
immunity?
i
suppose
is
to
keep
him
out
of
litigation
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
white
because?
justice
white
well,
i
know
but
that...
why
should
the
judicial
officer...
what's
the
purpose
of
giving
him
more
than
qualified
immunity?
justice
white
oh,
a
judge...
perhaps
a
judge
ought
to
know
what
clearly
established
law
is,
and
he
wouldn't
be
liable
unless
he
violated
it.
so
why
does
he
need
absolute
immunity
or
why
does
the
prosecutor?
justice
white
how
can
it
be
a
close
call
in
identifying
what
you've
just
said
isn't
too
hard
a
thing,
a
clearly
established
law?
justice
white
it
also
keeps
him
out
of
litigation,
absolute
immunity
does.
justice
white
xxx
this
fellow...
here's
this
person
sitting
behind
the
bench,
issuing
a
search
warrant
who
gets
absolute
immunity.
justice
white
yeah,
but
the
suit
says
he
isn't.
the
suit
says...
it
might
charge
him
with
all
sorts
of
things
for
which
he
would
be
immune.
justice
white
but
imbler
saved
the
question
of
whether
in
giving
advice...
wasn't
that
subject
to
an
absolute
immunity?
justice
white
but
just
giving
legal
advice
is
perhaps
different
from
actually
appearing
in
court
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
white
sure,
sure,
sure.
justice
white
but
it's
different
from
just
giving
legal
advice?
justice
white
and
somewhere
i
suppose
there
might
be
differences
between
what
the
advice
related
to.
like
in
this
case,
advice
about
hypnosis
is
maybe
different
from
giving
advice
about
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
white
well,
the
prosecutor
goes
with
the
police
to
execute
a
search
warrant
because
he
thinks
and
the
police
think
maybe
there's
some
question
about
how
far
they
can
go
with
the
search
if
he
goes
with
him
and
gives
him
some
advice
and
he's
dead
wrong.
is
it
absolute
immunity?
justice
white
so
you're
answer
is
he
would
be
absolutely
immune--
justice
white
--because
he's
only
giving
advice.
justice
white
well,
the
police
are
always
trying
to
make
cases,
and
so
here's
one
police
department
that
hires
their
own
lawyer
to
give
them
advice
about
search
warrants.
and
here's
another
police
department
that
relies
on
the
prosecutor.
you
think
there's
a
major
difference
between
those
two
systems?
justice
white
well,
enough
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
justice
scalia
joined
by
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
and
justice
marshall
has
joined
part
iii
of
justice
scalia's
opinion.
