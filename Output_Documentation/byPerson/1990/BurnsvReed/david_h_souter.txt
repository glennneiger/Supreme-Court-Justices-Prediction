justice
souter
of
course,
there's
a
third
alternative,
too,
isn't
there,
and
isn't
that
that
if
the
immunity
is
only
qualified,
any
prosecutor
who
has
the
option
is
not
going
to
give
advice
at
all.
he's
simply
going
to
say
to
the
police,
you're
on
your
own.
or
he's
going
to
do
whatever
he
can
to
encourage
the
police
to
have
their
own
lawyers,
so
that
he
is
simply
off
the
hook
for
this
possible
source
of
liability
entirely.
justice
souter
well,
if
you
had
the
choice
and
you
knew
that
by
giving
no
advice,
you
had
nothing
to
worry
about.
you
could
come
in
after
the
judicial
stage
was
reached,
and
whatever
might
happen
to
the
case,
at
least
it
would
be
no
risk
of
liability
on
you.
and
the
other
alternative
was
to
give
no
advice...
was
to
give
advice
and
assume
the
risk
of
such
liability
as
might
common
qualified
immunity.
you'd
take
the
first
alternative,
wouldn't
you?
justice
souter
that...
that's
right,
but
your
rule
would
in
fact
encourage
that
the
situation
in
which
the
advice
would
be
coming
from
the
sergeant
rather
than
coming
from
a
prosecutor
whom
one
hopes
might
have
some
detachment
and
perhaps
a
greater
fund
of
legal
knowledge.
