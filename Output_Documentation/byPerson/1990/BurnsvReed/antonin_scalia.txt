justice
scalia
excuse
me,
when
you
say
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
prosecutor,
you
mean
under
the
particular
state
law
in
question.
suppose
the
prosecutor
was
the
only
one
who
could
have
issued
an
arrest
warrant?
would
that
come
within
your...
in
this
particular
state,
would
that
come
within
your
test?
justice
scalia
mr.
sutherlin,
why...
let's
explore
that.
i
had
thought
that
the
only
justification
for
carving
out
judges
as
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule
of
just
qualified
immunity
is
that
judges
are
more
likely
to
be
sued.
there's
nothing
worse
than
a
disappointed
litigant,
and
that's
the
reason,
although
that...
we
have
no
more
need
to
be
impartial
than
the
attorney
general
or
a
lot
of
public
officers
who
are
supposed
to
act
in
the
public
interest
all
the
time.
but
we're
more
likely
to
be
sued
often.
now,
why
can't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
prosecutor
in
everything
he
does,
not
just
in
the
things
that
relate...
why
does
it
have
to
be
related
to
the
judicial
process?
the
only...
the
only
relevance
of
that
is
that
that
is
what
produces
the
likelihood
of
constant
litigation.
justice
scalia
i
understand
that,
and
that's
all
terrible
if
it...
you
know,
if
it
occurred
the
way
you
say,
but
what
also
could
have
occurred
is
he
could
have...
he
could
have
filed
a...
an
indictment
that
was
just...
just
a
pack
of
lies
for
which
he
would
have
had
absolute
immunity.
it
would
have
been
just
as
harmful,
just
as
unconstitutional,
whatever
else
you
want.
justice
scalia
now
why,
is
the
one
different
from
the
other?
i
agree.
absolute
immunity
is
a
terrible
thing,
but
why
should
we
give
it
to
them
for
the
one
rather
than
the
other?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
principle
you
use
to
get
there.
i
mean
you
say,
getting
legal
advice
must
have
absolute
immunity.
it
must
because
the
prosecutor
does
it,
and
then
you
say,
well,
therefore,
anybody
else
that
gives
legal
advice
also
has
immunity.
justice
scalia
what
is
all
this
based
on?
it
just
seems
sort
of
random.
justice
scalia
giving,
giving
legal
advice
is
an
integral
part
of
the
judicial
process?
justice
scalia
mr.
spear,
the,
the
phrase...
you
didn't
use
quite
the
phrase
that
we
used
in
imbler.
the
phrase
we
used
in
imbler
as
delineating
the
boundaries
of
our
holding
was,
was
that
the
respondents'
activities
were
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
yes,
justice.
justice
scalia
mr.
spear,
what,
what
happens
down
the
line...
if
the
person
who
gives
the
advice
has
absolute
immunity
and
the
person
who
receives
it
continues
to
have
qualified
immunity
i
suppose,
right?
justice
scalia
so
that
if
you
have
somebody
who
has
absolute
immunity
giving
advice
to
a
policeman,
as
long
as
a
policeman
seeks
advice
from
somebody
who
can't
possibly
be
held
liable
for
it,
the
policeman
can't
be
held
liable
and
also
the
person
who
gave
the
advice
can't
at
all
be
held
liable.
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
pretty
hard
fact
situation
where
you
get
advice
from
a
lawyer.
you're
not
yourself
a
lawyer.
that's,
that's
a
harsh
doctrine,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
does
it
matter
if
he's
a
prosecutor?
suppose
it's
somebody
else
who
gives
advice.
you
have
somebody
called
police
counsel
and
he
doesn't
prosecute
cases,
but
he
gives
advice
to
all
the
police--
justice
scalia
--well,
why
not?
justice
scalia
if
you
say
it's
an
integral
part
of--
justice
scalia
--the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process?
justice
scalia
the
competent
prosecutor
who
knows
it's
unconstitutional
says,
yes,
that's
constitutional,
go
beat
him
up.
i
mean
that's
what
you're
arguing
for?
justice
scalia
has
it
happened
up
until
now?
i
mean
how
many
suits
are
there
again
federal
prosecutors
for
giving
advice?
justice
scalia
we
have
said
that
qualified
immunity
is
an
objective
standard
insofar
as
our
involved
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
tries
to
show
that,
that
the
defendant
knew
it
was
wrong.
and
we
said
it
didn't
matter
whether
he
knew
it
was
wrong.
if
the
average
person
wouldn't
have
known
it
was
wrong,
the
qualified
immunity
defense
applies.
but
do
you
know
of
any
cases
where
we
have
or
other
federal
courts
have
rejected
a
good
faith
defense
by
someone
who
sought
legal
advice
and
although
somebody
else
might
have
known
otherwise,
he,
on
the
basis
of
legal
advice,
thought
what
he
was
doing
was
right?
but
i
don't
know
any.
