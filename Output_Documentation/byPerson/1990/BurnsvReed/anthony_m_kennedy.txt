justice
kennedy
well,
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
filing
of
charges?
i
thought
one
of
your
qualifications
was
that
it
had
to
be
prior...
in
conjunction
with
or
after
the
filing
of
charges?
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
kennedy
because
if
so,
that
would
take
care
of
justice
scalia's
question
and,
i
assume,
preclude
absolute
immunity
for
the
filing
of
any...
through
the
application
for
any
search
warrant
before
formal
charges
are
filed.
justice
kennedy
i
understand
that.
so
that
departs
somewhat
from
what
i...
at
least
i
thought
i
hear
you
say...
said
that
it
has
to
do
with
reference
to
the
filing
of
charges,
and
charges
are
not
filed
routinely
with
the
application
for
a
search
warrant.
justice
kennedy
i
did
say
arrest
warrant.
justice
kennedy
why
doesn't
that
apply
when
he
moves...
the
magistrate
for
a
search
warrant
before
an
arrest,
before
filing
charges?
in
an
official
appearance
before
the
court...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
more
like
an
appearance
with
reference
to
an
arrest
warrant
than
it
is
simply
giving
advice.
justice
kennedy
well,
didn't
the
state
trial
judge
testify
in
this
hearing
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
be
in
her
court
before
a
search
warrant
would
be
issued?
