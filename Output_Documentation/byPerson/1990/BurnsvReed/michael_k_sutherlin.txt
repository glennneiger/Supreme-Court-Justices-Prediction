mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
of
kathy
burns
presents
the...
this
court
with
the
opportunity
to
clarify
and
refine
its
holding
in
the
landmark
case
of
imbler.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
an
opportunity,
yes,
your
honor.
for
reason
of
public
policy
and
practicality,
i
will
respectfully
urge
upon
the
court
that
a
bright-line
test
can
be
established
to
help
resolve
the
conflicts
in
the
circuits
and
to
clarify
some
of
the
ambiguities
that
are
inherent
in
trying
to
discern
conduct
which
is
not
essential
to
the
initiation
of
filing
formal
criminal
charges.
the
bright-line
test
which
i
would
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
consider
is
as
follows.
that
only
that
conduct
which
is
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
prosecutor,
such
as
the
filing
of
formal
charges
and
presenting
the
state's
case,
should
be
protected
by
absolute
immunity.
conduct
which
precedes
the
filing
of
formal
charges
should
be
protected
by
the
substantial
protection
of
qualified
immunity.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
functional
approach
and
the
review
of
the
common
law
which
suggests
that
that
would
be
taken
into
account
in
a
primary
way.
if
the
prosecutor
of
that
jurisdiction
were
the
only
one
who
could
file
a
petition
or
a
request
for
a
warrant,
then
that
particular
conduct,
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
that
office,
would
be
deserving
of
the
protection
of
absolute
immunity.
but
in
the
case--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--in...
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
the...
this
court's
consideration
in
malley
v.
briggs
suggested
that
the
application
of
a
search
warrant
was
typically
not
a
judicial
act.
but
if
the
particular
state
prescribed
the
exclusive
power
of
the
prosecutor
and
gave
to
that
prosecutor
the
exclusive
power
to
seek
a
search
warrant,
then
i
think
that
under
the
functional
test
which
the
court
has
employed
in
all
types
of
immunity
cases,
that
it
would
make
no
difference
as
to
the
other
parties
who
may
be
involved
in
seeking
a
search
warrant.
but
if
the
prosecutor
were
the
only
one,
he
would
be
entitled
to
absolutely
immunity.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood
justice
scalia.
i
thought
he
said
an
arrest
warrant.
maybe
i
misunderstood.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
yes.
all
right.
for
reasons
of
public
policy
and
practicality,
the
bright-line
test
which
i
have
proposed
would
eliminate
many
of
the
problems
which
are
addressed
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
many
other
circuits.
the
public
policy
considerations
are
essentially
that
any...
anything
which
will
ensure
and
enhance
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
promotes
the
common
good
and
is
to
be
preferred
over
the
unfettered
power
of
the
prosecutor's
office.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
the
approach
taken
that
giving
advice
would
be
protected
by
absolute
immunity
because
the
court
deemed
that
to
be
quasi-judicial.
that
approach
does
not
resolve
the
continuing
problem
which
would
exist
even
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
that.
there
would
still
be
the
very
subjective
debate,
definitional
debate,
of
what
constitutes
advice
versus
what
constitutes
investigation
or
directing
an
investigation.
the
factual
assumptions
are
insupportable
that
would
lead
one
to
conclude
that
if
absolute
immunity
were
not
extended
to
such
conduct
as
giving
advice
that
the
prosecutor
would
be
hesitant
to
give
such
advice
and
would
be
flooded
with
a
deluge
of
litigation,
civil
rights
litigation.
the
14
years
following
imbler
suggest
the
contrary
is
true.
the
majority
of
circuits
have
interpreted
imbler
in
a
rather
restrictive
way,
allowing
absolute
immunity
only
for
those
essential
prosecutorial
functions
and
has
not
expanded
the
application
or
the
availability
of
absolute
immunity
to
other
functions
such
as
giving
advice.
one
could
then
argue,
reasonably,
that
in
those
circuits,
and
the
majority
of
them
have
been
i
think
applying
imbler
in
a
restrictive
fashion,
one
could
argue
then
that
you
would
see
a
deluge
or
at
least
an
imbalance
of
activity
against
prosecutors
in
those
jurisdictions
and
that
simply
is
not
in
evidence.
there
is
no...
been
no
complaint
and
no
dicta
within
these
opinions
which
suggests
that
these
circuits
are
handicapped
or
burdened
with
a
number
of
prosecutional
misconduct
cases.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
that
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
the
idea
of
giving
advice,
justice
white,
is
certainly
to
be
encouraged,
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
any
ruling
under
imbler
or
any
clarification
should
impede
that.
but
what
we
want
to
ensure
is
good
advice,
and
to
allow
prosecutorial
immunity
or
absolute
immunity--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
qualified
immunity
is
a
substantial
protection.
under
the
holding
of
harlow,
the
objective
test
would
require
that
the
prosecutor
or
any
other
advice
giver,
violate
a
clearly
established
principle
of
law
before
he
would
be
liable.
so,
in
practice,
if
the
prosecutor
asserts
the,
the
affirmative
defense
of
good
faith
and
it
is
shown
that
his
conduct
did
not
violate
any
clearly
established
principle,
the
case
if
over
as
to
him.
and
he
is
out
of
the
process
of
litigation.
that
substantial
protection
was
reiterated
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
imbler.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
the...
your
honor,
the
public
policy
and
functional
assessment
or
analysis
of
that
office
has
led
this
court
and
traditionally
has
resulted
in
the
belief
that
certain
core,
essential
functions
must
be
protected
by
absolute
immunity--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--because
they
act
as
a
judicial
officer,
making
critical
decisions.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
it
would
impede
his
ability
to
make
impartial
and
objective
judgements.
he
might
be
hesitant
to
rule
on
the
merits
and
might
be
fearful
of
the
outcome,
seeing
the
potential
of
liability.
and
it's
the
judicial
immunity
that
was
found
appropriate
and
was
clarified
in
the
case
of
forrester,
that
is,
if
it's
not
an
essential
judicial
function
but
an
administrative
function,
then
you
do
not
need
to
protect
that
activity
with
absolute
immunity,
but
only
qualified
immunity,
which
as
i--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--the...
justice
white,
the
prosecutor's
office
as
sovereign...
as
counsel
for
the
sovereign
is
perhaps
the
most
powerful
office
and
his
discretionary
power
requires
him
to
make
judgments,
often
close
calls.
qualify--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--oftentimes,
it
is
difficult
to
discern
on
the
spot
what
clearly
defined
law
is.
but
if
it
is
a
close
call
under
the
objective
standard,
the
prosecutor
is
protected.
in
other
words,
he's
not
cautioned
to
withdraw
from
the
edge
of
what
that
clearly
defined
standard
is.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
well,
absolute
immunity
would
keep
him
out
of
litigation,
but
it
would
not
promote
the
public
good
and
would
not
serve
any
legitimate
public
policy
interest.
what
we
want...
what
is
primarily
in...
is
to
be
protected
in
the
prosecutor's
office...
is
his
function
of
discerning
those
meritorious
prosecutorial
cases.
as
counsel
for
the
sovereign
in
a
representative
government,
acting
on
behalf
of
all
the
citizens.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
issue
was
addressed
in
malley
v.
briggs,
in
that
if
you
apply
the
functional
test
it
should
make
no
difference
what
hat
the
person
is
wearing,
but
what
the
function
under
scrutiny
truly
is.
and
if
a
police
officer
can
come
in
and
apply
for
a
search
warrant
and
misleads
the
court
or
is
found
to
be
an
inappropriate
act,
exposing
him
to
liability
under
qualified
immunity,
then
it
is
inconsistent
and
impractical
to
then
say
to
the
prosecutor
but
because
of
the
hat
you're
wearing,
we
are
going
to
give
you
absolute
immunity.
it
would
create
in
the
public's
mind
an
inconsistent
outcome
and
would
invite
just--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--that
is
correct,
justice
white,
and
that's
as
it
should
be
because
he
is...
he
is
charged
with
being
an
impartial
magistrate,
determining
whether
or
not
a
warrant
should
be
issued--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--in
this
country
anybody
can
be
sued
for
the
cost
of
a
filing
fee.
but
the
process
of
protecting
that
officer
from
being
involved
and
protracted
litigation
would
permit
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
trial
rule
11
sanctions
would
caution
any
practitioner
to
be
quite
careful
about
his
allegations.
there
are
adequate
protections,
but
to
extend
absolute
immunity
to
this
particular
prosecutor,
mr.
reed,
for
the
conduct
under
scrutiny,
would
be
to
suggest
that
almost
anything
that
a
prosecutor
does
prior
to
filing
formal
charges
would
be
protected.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
justice
scalia,
in
this
particular
case,
all
the
conduct
preceded
any
judicial
involvement.
the
prosecutor
gave
permission
to
hypnotize
cathy
burns,
contrary
to
the
advice
of
the
police
officer
which
suggested
by
his
training
that
it
was
improper
and
contrary
to
the
prohibitions
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
particular
prosecutor
then
went
down
and
viewed
a
videotape
of
the
forensic
hypnosis
and
by
all
accounts
violated
every
professional
and
ethical
protocol,
including
the
post-hypnotic
suggestion
that
she
would
not
remember
any
of
the
activities
under
hypnosis
and
that
she
would
cooperate
fully
with
the
police.
that
conduct
was
followed
by
a
discussion
on
whether
or
not
to
make
the
source
of
this
so-called
interpretation
of
a
confession
public.
the
following
day,
mr.
reed,
with
officer
scroggins,
presented
to
the
court
a
dishonest
statement
of
the
basis
for
seeking
a
search
warrant.
all
of
that
preceded
the
filing
of
any
formal
charges.
all
of
that
without
any
judicial--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
in
most
competing
interests
where
one
right
could
be,
say,
trampled
by
a
governmental
objective,
there
must
be
a
balancing.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
balance
would
have
resulted
in
a
finding
that
if
mr.
reed
had
sought
the
authority
of
the
court
and
had
obtained
an
indictment,
then
from
that
point,
that
is,
the
filing
of
the
indictment
and
from
that
point
one
his
conduct
would
be
absolutely
immune,
because
we
must
tolerate
those
instances
of
egregious
conduct
in
order
to
protect
the
judicial
processes.
we
must
tolerate
cases
such
as
this.
if
they
had
been
filed,
if
the
conduct
had
occurred
after
the
filing,
but
because
the
conduct
occurred
all
prior
to
the
filing,
because
the
dishonesty
to
the
court
in
seeking
the
search
warrant
occurred
prior
to
the
filing,
because
cathy
burns
was
detained
for
8
days
before
there
was
a
formal
filing
of
the
charge,
because
in
seeking
the
warrant
for
arrest,
there
was
still
no
mention
of
the
search
warrant.
all
of
this
conduct
is
so
reprehensible
that
to
extend
absolute
immunity
to
this
kind
of
conduct
would
be
to
create
more
confusion
and
more
conflict
in
the
circuits.
there
would
be
inevitably
a
difficult
subjective
process
of
trying
to
discern
whether
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
is
investigative
or
whether
it
is
simply
advisory
as
the
seventh
circuit
held.
it
may
be
both.
but
you
would
be
forced...
or
the
trial
court
would
be
forced
to
defer
to
a
fact
finder.
in
the
proposed
bright-line
test
which
i
have
recommended
to
the
court,
most
of
those
problems
would
be
eliminated.
if
the
conduct
was
the
exclusive
and
an
essential
prerogative
of
the
prosecutor's
office,
then
that
could
be
easily
determined.
but
if
the
conduct
were
advisory
or
investigative
prior
to
the
filing
of
formal
charges,
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
distinguish,
as
the
seventh
circuit
tried
to
do,
whether
or
not
there
was
an
active
participation
or
passive
advising
activity.
it
is
important
to
realize
that
if
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
continue
to
give
advice
to
police,
whether
it
be
at
the
local
level
or
at
the
federal
level,
that
he
must
reserve
some
caution
and
some
respect
for
the
constitution
and
the
rights
of
the
individual.
if
he
is
simply
going
to
be
allowed
to
shoot
from
the
hip
and
give
bad
advice,
then
no
public
policy
is
well
served,
no
common
good
is
advanced.
what
is
encouraged
by
the
allowance
of
qualified
immunity
is
to
encourage
that
prosecutor,
or
any
legal
advisor
for
that
matter,
to
use
caution,
to
take
an
informed
position,
to
reflect
before
he
advises
the
police
on
their
actions
which
may
in
fact
infringe
upon
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
justice
souter,
if...
that
is
a
possibility
of
course,
and
i
suppose
it
might
depend
on
each
individual's
propensities
to
give
advice
and
to
involve
themselves
in--
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
--if
i
may
answer
this
way,
justice
souter.
applying
the
functional
approach
would
not
require
somebody
to
look
at
the
particular
hat
of
the
person
giving
advice.
so
if
a
sergeant
were
to
give
advice
or
a
legal
advisor
who
is
an
attorney
or
may
not
be
an
attorney
would
give
advice
and
that
advice
would
lead
to
a
violation
of
one's
constitutional
rights,
then
under...
and
if
the
plaintiff
met
his
burden
of
proof
under
1983,
that
person
would
be
held
liable.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
well,
if...
if
the
public
policy
to
be
served
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
that
is,
the
integrity
of
the
discretionary
power
of
the
prosecutor
to
file
charges
or
not,
then
other
activities
of
the
prosecutor,
which
perhaps
might
make
him
less
objective
and
might
draw
him
into
being
a
part
of
the
investigative
effort,
that
might
cause
him
to
jeopardize
his
impartiality
and
his
objectivity.
but
absolute
immunity
would
encourage
just
the
opposite.
absolute
immunity
would
encourage
the
giving
of
bad
advice
freely
without
fearing
consequences.
and
what
public
policy
in
this
matter
should,
i
think...
should
predominate
would
be
that
the
prosecutor
would
reflect
and
be
cautious.
and
if
he
isn't
truly
acting
on
the,
on
the
office
as
he's
been
entrusted
with...
properly,
he
would
give
the
proper
advice.
and
even
in
a
close
call,
he
would
be
protected
by
the
substantial
protection
of
qualified
immunity.
it
is
only
when
the
conduct
is
so
egregious
that
it
violates
clearly
established
law
is
the
prosecutor
going
to
be
found
liable
for
this
conduct
that
precedes
the
filing
of
formal
charges.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
court's
holding
in,
in
malley.
it's
consistent
with
the
briscoe
case,
which
said
that
a
witness,
a
police
officer,
who
gives
false
testimony
after
the
filing
of
formal
charges,
is
absolutely
immune.
because
at
that
point
the
state's
immense
power
has
now
been
brought
to
bear
on
an
objective
of
obtaining
a
prosecution.
and
if...
if
that's
the
line
of
demarkation,
then
from
that
point
on
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
and
the
witnesses
should
enjoy
absolutely
immunity.
i
might
point
out
that
the
assertions
of
the
respondent
in
this
matter
simply
do
not
hold
up
under
scrutiny.
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
study,
the
empirical
study,
in
the
cornell
law
review
article
which
suggests
that
less
than
4
percent
of
the
1983
cases
involve
prosecutorial
misconduct.
and
in
my
reading
of
that
article
suggests
that
the
majority
of
them
are
disposed
of
without
going
to
trial.
and
of
the
cases
scrutinized
in
the
central
district
of
california
for
1975
and
'76,
only
two
cases,
i
believe,
went
to
trial.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
particular
article
actually
analyzed
the
method
by
which
these
cases
were
disposed,
and
the
vast
majority
of
them,
all
but
two
as
i
recall,
were
disposed
of
by
motions
to
dismiss
or
summary
judgment.
so
the
prosecutor
was
not
burdened
by
being
involved
in
protracted
litigation.
and
as
i
suggested,
the
14-year
opportunity,
if
you
will,
to
allow
the
circuits
to
be
legal
laboratories
have
produced
a
plausible
argument
that
they
are
not
burdened
by
this
restrictive
application
as
instructed
and
as
taught
by
imbler
to
allow
the
prosecutor
only
absolute
immunity
for
those
essential
functions.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
that
is
quite
possible,
your
honor.
but
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
and
the
amici
do
not
challenge
our
assertions.
they
merely
restate
the
argument
that
they
will
be
burdened
or
that
they
will
be
encumbered.
there
is
no
statistical
information.
there
is
no
fact
source
which
can
demonstrate
that
that
is
supportable.
and
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
what
would
be
encouraged
if
the
respondents
arguments
were
persuasive
would
be
even
a
more
divisive
problem
in
the
circuits.
they
would
still
have
to
consider
what
is
the
distinction
between
advice
and
investigatory.
and
in
the
proposed
bright-line
test
which
i
have
respectfully
urged
this
court
to
consider,
most
of
those
problems
would
be
resolved
at
the
threshold
of
the
litigation
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
clearly
established
principle
of
law
which
the
prosecutor
and...
had
violated.
and
if
he
had
not
violated
a
clearly
established
principle
of
law,
then
the
case
ends
as
to
him.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
the...
your
honor,
if
i
could
answer
that
question
very
briefly.
the
common
law
suggests
that
the
prosecutor
enjoys
immunity
but
not
absolute
immunity
for
everything
he
does.
in
the
state
of
indiana,
for
example,
the
prosecutor
is
defined
as
a
law
enforcement
officer,
and
even
under
state
tort
law,
which
is
derived
from
common
law,
he
would
be
exposed
to
a
liability
for
false
arrest.
and
as
we've
alleged
in
this
particular
case
and
as
of...
and
as
the
facts
are
demonstrated
on
the
record,
mr.
reed
was
instrumental
and
crucial
in
the
decision
to
arrest
cathy
burns
without
a
warrant,
based
upon
his
opinion
that
there
was
probable
cause.
so
the
common
law
tradition
suggests
that
there
is
perhaps
a
need
to
protect
the
essential
function
of
the
prosecutor,
that
is,
the
prosecutorial
function,
the
initiation
of
filing
formal
charges
and
the
presentation
of
the
state's
case.
but
everything
in
addition
to
that,
outside
of
that,
was
regarded
traditionally
as
more
of
a
police
function
and
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
although
this
court
may
not
necessarily
reach
the
question
of
qualified
immunity
when
asked
by
the
trial
judge
to
rule
on
a
direct
or
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
in
each
of
those
instances,
the
trial
judge
found
that
mr.
reed
was
not
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
but
it
was
at
the
close
of
plaintiff's
case
on
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
that
the
court
chose
to
review
the
henderson
v.
lopez
case
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
indirectly
talked
about
advice
and
simply
found,
not
on
the
basis
of
qualified
immunity,
but
simply
found
on
the
basis
of
the
henderson
case,
that
if
advice
was...
giving
advice
was
involved,
then
the
prosecutor
was
absolutely
immune
without
getting
to
the
specific
activities.
and
what
is
created
as
a...
is
confusion.
and
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you
have
the
inevitable
problem
that
if
you
have
a
police
officer
interrogating
an
individual
at
the
police
station
and
in
the
process
shredding
the
constitution
to
tiny
bits
with
the
prosecutor
standing
there
advising
him
of
the
questions
to
ask,
then
the
police
officer
is
entitled
only
to
qualified
immunity
based
upon
the
hypothetical
and
the
prosecutor
gets
absolute
immunity.
what
a
couple
circuits
have
said,
that
is
so
inconsistent
that
the
police
officer
must
be
entitled
to
raise
the
affirmative
defense
of
good
faith,
because
what
he
has
done
is
sought
the
best
advice
possible
and
in
doing
so,
he
has
drawn
himself
into
the
shadow
of
the
absolute
immunity
protection.
mr.
michael
k.
sutherlin
i
believe
that
i
can't
right
now
cite
you
to
one,
justice
scalia,
but
i
believe
have
run
across
at
least
two
cases
in
preparing
where
the
courts
have
said
it
would
be
an
inconsistent
outcome
to
hold
the
prosecutor
absolutely
immune
and
to
find
that
the
police
officer
was
not
entitled
to
any
immunity,
although
he
might
otherwise
be,
because
he
sought
the
advice.
and
the
dilemma
that
would...
that
all
the
courts
would
face
if
the
arguments
were
adopted
of
the
solicitor
general
and
the
respondent
would
be
that
the
trial
courts
would
still
be
faced
with
the
dilemma
of
discerning
the
difference
between
investigative
activities
and
giving
advice.
there
is
no
simple
advice.
that
occurs
in
the
classroom.
the
police
officer
sought
advice
expecting
to
get
it.
the
prosecutor
gave
it
expecting
that
it
would
be
followed
and
in
this
particular
instance
on
numerous
occasions
at
critical
junctures
of
the
investigation,
the
advice
was
clearly
intended
to
direct...
the
force
of
the
investigation
was
clearly
intended
to
violate
mrs.
burns'
rights
by
first
hypnotizing
her,
then
by
detaining
her
on
the
opinion...
on
his
opinion
that
it
was
without...
that
it
was
based
on
probable
cause,
but
without
a
warrant.
had
he
gone
to
the
court
and
had
he
presented
the
information
as
is
required
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
court
in
an
open
and
candid
fashion,
there
would
not
be
a
lawsuit.
and
what
he
has
tried
to
do
is
to
say
that
because
this
is
in
the
nature
of
a
quasi-judicial
function,
or
is
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
process,
that
he's
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
not
the
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
