justice
stevens
mr.
sutherlin,
most
of
your
argument
has
been
in
the
nature
of
a
kind
of
argument
you
make
to
a
legislature
about
what
kind
of
rule
we
ought
to
adopt
and
what
would
be
a
wise
rule.
haven't
we
in
the
past
looked
to
the
common
law
for
some
kind
of
guidance
on
what
the
scope
of
this
immunity
is,
and
if
so,
what
would
we
find
there?
justice
stevens
mr.
spear,
looking
at
your,
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
prompted
this
thought
in
my
mind.
looking
only
at
the
legal
advice
aspect
of
the
case,
i
guess
different
communities
can
have
different
methods
of
providing
the
police
department
with
legal
advice
and
supposing
the
police
department
in
a
city
hired
its
own
lawyer
who's
not
a
prosecutor?
his
sole
function
is
to
handle
their
pensions,
handle
their
internal
things,
and
also
to
give
legal
advice
in
the
course
of
their
duties.
would
such
a
person
be
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
it
would
be
that
the
police
have
a
regular
procedure
of
going
to
some
lawyer...
maybe
they
hire
the
lawyer
just
to
give
the
police
legal
advice...
but
he
never
prosecutes.
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
what
some
prosecutors
do.
justice
stevens
but
you
say
that,
that
if,
if
any...
a
nonprosecutor
gives
legal
advice,
he'd
get
the
prosecutorial
immunity?
justice
stevens
part
of
his
duties.
justice
stevens
does
he
give
better
legal
advice
if
he
has
absolute
immunity
than
if
he
has
no
immunity?
most
lawyers
don't
need
absolute
immunity
to
give
legal
advice.
justice
stevens
well,
some
of
them
are.
we've
had
cases
involving
suits
against
defense
counsel.
we've
had
suits
a
lot
from
the
malpractice
actions.
there
are
a
lot
of
litigations
against
lawyers.
justice
stevens
mr.
spear--
--and
also
the
doctrine
grew
out
of
the
common
law
and
i'm
curious
to
what
extent
can
you
point
or
call
our
attention
to
common
law
authority
for
the
proposition
that
a
prosecutor
giving
legal
advice
is
absolutely
immune?
justice
stevens
which
is
not
a
legal
advice
case.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
the
one
where
he
added
the
name
to
the--
justice
stevens
--well,
have
you
got
any
cases
involving
giving
legal
advice
to
police
officers?
justice
stevens
wherein
at
the
common
law
it
was
found
that
that
was
absolutely
immune.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
that's
not
an
immunity
argument,
that's
just
there
was
no
cause
of
action,
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
mr.
lazerwitz,
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i've
asked
the
other
lawyers?
to
what
extent
are
you
aware
of
common
law
precedent
for
the
position
you
take?
justice
stevens
with
the
cuts
against
you
of
course.
justice
stevens
well,
i
suppose
it's
still
somewhat
unsettled
as
to
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
here,
too.
this
is
a
little
bit
unusual.
justice
stevens
so
you
want
to
argue
alternative,
not
argue
for
immunity,
but
just
argue
as
an
analogy
of
the
common
law
that
while
the
lawyer
isn't
responsible
in
this
situation.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
really
suggest
that
no
prosecutor
would
ever
give
legal
advice
if
he
didn't
absolutely
mean
it.
but
he's
perfectly
confident
of
his
position.
he's
going
to
give
the
advice.
it's
only
on
these
fringe
areas,
can
i
hypnotize
some
woman
who's
got
14
personalities,
can
i
give
that
kind
of
legal
advice
is
what
we're
talking
about.
but
when
you're
in
settled
areas
of
the
law
where
he
knows
what
he's
talking
about,
he
doesn't
need
absolute
immunity.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
thing
you're
avoiding
is
frivolous
suits.
you're
not
necessarily...
you
don't
have
to
have
this
rule
to
be
sure
that
competent
prosecutors
will
give
sound
advice.
you're
talking...
there
is
a
danger
that
that
competent
prosecutor
will
be
sued
and
you
want
to
keep
as
much
as
that
frivolous
litigation
out
of
the
court
system.
but
i
don't
think
the
goal
you're
seeking
is
be
sure
there's
some
prosecutors
out
there
who
are
willing
to
answer
police
officers'
questions.
