mr.
harvey
g.
samson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
may
4,
1987,
gerald
sanderfoot
filed
a
petition
for
relief
pursuant
to
chapter
7
of
the
united
states
bankruptcy
code.
on
that
date
mr.
sanderfoot
was
burdened
with
nearly
$50,000
of
unsecured
debt,
not
including
any
amounts
owed
to
his
former
wife.
mr.
sanderfoot
sought
the
protection
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
thousands
of
others,
to
produce
a
fresh
start.
this
case
would
have
ended
like
thousands
of
others
except
for
the
fact
that
a
divorce
court
8
months
prior,
on
september
12,
1986,
had
awarded
ms.
san...
ms.
farrey
a
judicial
lien
in
a
homestead
awarded
to
mr.
sanderfoot.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
pursuant
to...
section
767.255
of
the
wisconsin
statutes,
which
allows
a
divorce
court
to
divest
and
transfer
title.
it's
very
specific.
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
that
lien
is
avoidable
pursuant
to
section
522(f)(1)
of
the
code.
article
i,
section
8
of
the
united
states
constitution
provides
that
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
establish
uniform
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcy
throughout
the
states.
the
bankruptcy
code
was
passed
in
1978
after
nearly
10
years
worth
of
work.
it
was
a
significant
departure
from
the
prior
bankruptcy
act
of
1898.
it
was
not,
however,
a
departure
from
the
primary
purpose
of
bankruptcy,
which
was
and
is
to
provide
overburdened
debtors
with
the
ability
to
start
over
free
from
his
or
her
other
debt.
and
that
debt
has
to
be
incurred
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy.
bankruptcy
has
been
built
on
the
premise
that
most
creditors
will
have
to
forfeit
their
right
to
payment.
ms
farrey
in
this
particular
case
and
in
oral
argument
has
made
much
of
the
economic
impact
of
this
bankruptcy
on
her,
that
it
is
not
fair
and
that
it
divests
her
of
her
property.
all
creditors
in
a
bankruptcy
are
deprived
of
some
property
using
that
term
in
its
broadest
sense.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
don't
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
problem
is
that
in
the
divorce
court
the
property
was
specifically
awarded
to
mr.
sanderfoot,
very
specifically.
the
court
said
in
its
very
first
statement,
the
home
of
the...
the
home
is
awarded
to
the
respondent,
mr.
sanderfoot.
and
then
after
a
long
statement
regarding
property
division,
awarded
a
money
judgment,
in
effect,
to
ms.
farrey
for
$29,000
plus.
it
is
not
a
half
of
the
house
interest.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
we
don't
believe
that
for
bankruptcy
purposes
that
it
is
a
security
interest.
security
interest
is
defined
by
bankruptcy--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--it
was--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--it
was
secured
by
some
sort
of
lien,
yes.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
imposed
by
the
divorce
court.
and
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
key
here.
in
bankruptcy
congress
has
defined
certain
very
key
words.
one
of
the
key
words
that
it
has
defined
is
judicial
lien.
a
judicial
lien,
as
mr.
williamson
indicates,
is
defined
as
a
lien
obtained
by
judgment,
levy,
sequestration,
or
other
legal
or
equitable
process
or
proceeding.
that
is
in
section
101(32).
in
section
101(33)
lien
is
defined
as
a
charge
against
or
interest
in
property
to
secure
payment
of
a
debt
or
performance
of
an
obligation.
in
101(46)
the
bankruptcy
code
defines
security
agreement
as
meaning
an
agreement
that
creates
or
provides
for
a
security
interest,
and
(47)
defines
security
interest
as
meaning
a
lien
created
by
agreement.
now,
one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
entire
case
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case.
it
is
not
a
family
law
case.
and
bankruptcy
defines
the
terms.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
if
i
understand
your
question--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
scalia,
what
you're
asking
is
if
there
was
a
judgment
against
mr.
sanderfoot
before
he
purchased?
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
am
having
some
difficulty
because
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
i
think
as
in
most
other
states,
a
warranty
deed
requires
that
you
provide
a
deed
free
and
clear
of
all
those
types
of
questions.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
a
quit
claim
deed?
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
in
my
opinion
with
a
quit
claim
deed,
yes,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
prior
owner's
lien,
assuming
that
you
could
not
avoid
the
lien
under
state
law,
which
would
allow
a
homestead
exemption
clause.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
if
he
paid
for
it,
it
may
well
fix
on
an
interest
of
his,
assuming
he
can...
it's
a
homestead
of
some
sort.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
well,
the
difficulty
with
the--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
because,
again,
it's
got
to
fix
on
an
interest...
and,
with
all
due
respect
to
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
it's
likely
that
that
kind
of
situation
is
going
to
occur,
strictly
because--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--it's
perfectly
conceivable--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--under
the--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--if
it's
unlimited
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
problem
with
that.
it
would
be
subject
to
that,
i
believe.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
think
we're
having
some
semantic
difficulty
here.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
don't
think
it
would
be
avoidable.
it
is
not
a
debt
of
the
person
who
has
purchased--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
in
the
broadest
sense,
yes,
but
he
always
had
an
interest.
his
interest
didn't
change
as
drastically
as
ms.
farrey's.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
in
the
state
of
wisconsin--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
a
presumption
that
all
property
in
a
marriage
is
marital
in
nature
and
subject
to
division.
there
has
been
confusion
since
1986
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
since
the
passage
of
the
wisconsin
marital
property
act
regarding
the
term
marital
property.
and
the
state,
a
state
appeals
court
in
the
kuhlman
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
specifically
says
that
marital
property
law,
which
is
chapter
766
of
the
wisconsin
statute,
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
divorce.
none.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
not
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
but
that
has
been
the
law
since
well
prior
to
that.
however,
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
section
767.255,
which
is
the
section
that
allows
division
of
property,
specifically
states
that
the
court
shall
divest
and
transfer
title
as
it
deems
appropriate.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
it
did
change.
sole
ownership
in
mr.
sanderfoot.
and
thereafter--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--it
did
not
have
the
lien
until
the
point
that
all
of
the
property
division
had
been
concluded.
and
this
could
have
been
solved
very
simply
by
the
divorce
court
by
awarding
the
property,
which
the
court
has
the
power
to
do,
as
tenants-in-common
with
a
provision
that
mr.
sanderfoot
could
purchase
ms.
farrey's
interest
at
a
certain
point
in
time
for
x
number
of
dollars.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
no,
the
property
that...
oh,
in
your
case,
yes,
that
didn't.
but
conceivably
that's
true.
it
is
in
bankruptcy
not
the
economic
circumstances
of
the
creditors
on
which
the
focus
occurs.
also,
this,
in
our
opinion,
is
not
a
question
of
fairness
to
creditors,
for,
as
we
have
stated,
bankruptcy
is
not
fair
to
creditors.
the
case
itself--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
code
also
defines
purchaser
as
being
a
voluntary
transferee.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
again,
that
is
one
of
the
key
terms,
is
"an
interest".
and
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
look
at
that,
at
the
term
the
fixing
of
a
lien,
without
looking
at
the
next
phrase,
an
interest.
it
doesn't
say
the
interest.
it
doesn't
say
all
of
the
interest.
it
says
an
interest,
and
"an"
is
the
dictionary
equivalent
of
the
term
"any".
so
if
you
start,
if
you
look
at
that
statute
and
read
it
with
an
equivalent
term
in
it,
it
says
the
fixing
of
a
lien
on
any
interest
of
the
debtor
in
exempt
property.
and...
you
had
asked
a
question
previously
regarding
the
question
of
if
it's
fixed
prior
to
bankruptcy
or
fixing
after
the
filing,
clearly
it
cannot
fix
after
the
filing
because
there's
an
automatic
stay.
it
would
not
occur
in
any
event.
the
question
is,
the
term
"fixing",
is
it
used
as
a
term
of
art,
which
i
don't
believe
it
is.
i
think
it
has
to
be
on
an
interest
that
was
in
existence
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
because
bankruptcy
presumes
that
we
look
at
the
debtor
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
not
some
time
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
the
estate
is
defined
in
section
541
as
that
as
in
existence
on
the
date
of
the
filing,
and
on
the
date
of
the
filing
mr.
sanderfoot
was
the
only
one
with
any
interest
in
this
particular
piece
of
property.
i
think
that
the
more
basic--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--correct.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
well,
i
think
that
the,
that
522(f)
specifically
says
that
we
look
at
judicial
liens
regardless
of
when
they
were
filed
or
when
they
attached.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
would
tend
to
agree.
i
would
tend
to
agree,
justice
white.
i
think
it
is,
and
i
think
that
we
can
say
that
although
congress
has
not
been
real
good
at
sometimes
putting
language
in
the
statutes,
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
overall
situation
and
the
policy
of
congress
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
they
didn't
say
that,
and
we
need
to
look
at
what
fixing
is.
but
i
think
that
fixing
has
to
look,
be
guided
by
the
term
"an
interest",
again.
and
clearly
mr.
sanderfoot,
when
this
lien
attached,
had
an
interest
in
this
home.
and
under
the
circumstances
i
think
that
it
obviously
impairs
an
interest
of
his.
again,
the
code
does
not
require
that
it
impair
a
total
interest.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
well,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
clearly
if
you
cannot
claim
property
exempt,
the
lien
would
still
stay
on
that
property.
the
question
of
commercial
property
is
not
brought
up.
in
this
particular
case
we
are
talking
about
congressional
intent.
that
is
the
question.
did
congress
intend
to
treat
this
type
of
lien
to
secure
a
property
division
payment
differently
than
every
other
judicial
lien?
we
do
not
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit's
determination
is
contrary
to
either
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
nor
the
legislative
intent.
again--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--well,
the
legislative
history
on
rush
to
the
courthouse,
justice
stevens,
is
in
a
line
from
the
house
report.
the
senate
report
does
not
contain
that
language,
nor
does
the
final
form
of
522.
67(a)
in
the
act
did.
it
was
very
specific.
there
were
two
requirements
in
67(a),
4
months
within
the
filing,
plus
the
debtor
had
to
be
insolvent.
both
of
those
were
terminated
totally
in
this
situation.
had
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
time
limit,
they
would
have
said
that.
now,
the
legislative
history
on
a
lot
of
the
code,
and
one
of
the
specific
ones
is
523(d)(1),
the
senate
had
$10,000
in
for
a
homestead
exemption
and
the
house
had
$7,500,
and
it
ended
up
being
$7,500.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
correct.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
in
determining
avoidability
it
will
be
the
federal
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--in
my
opinion
it
is,
because
it's
got
to
be
inconsistent
if
the
language
of
the
law
doesn't
say
within
so
many
months,
days,
years,
or
whatever.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
correct.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
correct.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
yes.
under
section
767.255
of
the
wisconsin
statutes,
the
court
had
awarded
all
of
the
property
to
him.
he
owned
that
property.
no
one
else
had
an
ownership
interest.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
i
believe
he
did.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
no.
he
interest
was
changed
from
a
property
interest,
an
interest
in
her
property--
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
--the
interest
went
to
mr.
sanderfoot.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
the
one-half
interest,
but
the
statute
says
an
interest.
and
again,
this
is
not
a
division
of
the
house
itself.
this
is
a
division
of
an
entire
marital
estate
for
divorce
purposes.
mr.
harvey
g.
samson
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
provides
that
this
judgment
lien
is
avoidable.
ms.
farrey
is
requesting
that
this
court
graft
onto
section
522(f)
an
exception
not
put
there
by
congress,
that
exception
being
for
property
division
equalizing
payment
liens.
if
such
an
exception
is
to
be
placed,
it
is
to
be
placed
by
congress
and
not
the
courts.
congress,
since
the
passage
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
has
been
very
active
in
modifying
the
code.
attempts
by
courts,
in
our
opinion,
to
find
these
types
of
liens
as
being
nonavoidable
under
522
are
not
based
upon
the
policy
determinations
nor
the
intent
of
congress,
but
on
emotionalism
and
a
desire
to
bend
the
code
to
meet
that
particular
court's
perception
of
justice.
congress
is
charged
with
providing...
uniform
laws
on
bankruptcy.
congress
is
charged
with
determining
policy.
congress
should
make
the
determination
if
this
particular
lien
should
not
be
avoided.
when
congress
has
spoken
so
clearly
on
a
policy
determination
of
avoidance
of
what
is
clearly
a
judicial
lien,
it
should
be
given
its
fullest
possible
effect.
the
seventh
circuit's
determination
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
