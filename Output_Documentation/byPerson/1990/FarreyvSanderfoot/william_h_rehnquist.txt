chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-350,
jeanne
farrey
v.
gerald
j.
sanderfoot.
mr.
williamson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
in
that
hypothesis
a
property
settlement
agreement
which
is
recorded
and
the
parties
exchange
a
deed
and
mortgage,
and
the
court
adopts...
enters
a
decree
based
on
that,
still
the
mortgage
would
be
a
judicial
lien?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
does
the
savings
and
loan
mortgage
pass
through
bankruptcy?
because
it's
a
purchased
money
mortgage?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
williamson.
mr.
samson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
sure
the
bankruptcy
code
isn't
designed
to
let
you
start
over
with
part
of
someone
else's
house.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
secured
by
that,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
i
mean
just
in
common
parlance
there
was
a
requirement
this
amount
of
money
be
paid
and
the
obligation
to
pay
it
was
secured
by
some
sort
of
an
interest,
a
security
interest
on
the
house.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
imposed
by
the
bankruptcy
court...
by
the
divorce
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
samson.
mr.
williamson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
williamson.
the
case
is
submitted.
