mr.
brady
c.
williamson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
bankruptcy
and
divorce,
about
the
relationship
between
federal
law
and
state
law,
and
about
fundamental
fairness
for
one
woman.
jeanne
farrey
left
a
wisconsin
courtroom
about
4
years
ago
with
half
of
the
property
from
her
long
marriage,
only
to
lose
it
all
a
few
months
later
in
the
federal
bankruptcy
process.
yet
it
was
not
jeanne
farrey
who
filed
for
bankruptcy.
it
was
her
former
husband,
who,
at
least
so
far,
has
been
permitted
to
use
the
federal
bankruptcy
code,
in
the
words
of
the
dissenting
just...
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals,
to
steal
from
his
former
wife.
for
many
american
families
and
for
the
judicial
system
itself,
the
resolution
of
this
mundane
dispute
between
jeanne
farrey
and
gerald
sanderfoot
will
have
farreaching
and
lasting
consequences.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
justice
kennedy,
that
raises
an
interesting
question.
the
court
may
well
have
been
able
to
say
to
mr.
sanderfoot
sign
a
mortgage,
but
that
would
not
have
made
it,
sir,
any
less
a
judicial
lien
under
the
expansive
definition
that
congress
has
provided
in
section
101
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
one
of
the
great
difficulties
with
this
case
is
that,
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
decided
it--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
settled
authority.
indeed,
as
we
have
discussed
in
the
brief,
one
issue
that
may
follow
this
case
to
this
courtroom,
given
the
appropriate
resolution
of
the
case,
is
what
happens
in
consensual
divorces,
stipulated
divorces,
where
the
parties
come
to
the
court
and
say
we've
reached
an
agreement,
it
is
not
contested.
but
yet
in
most
states,
including
wisconsin,
the
courts
still
have
to
enter
a
judgment
that
adopts
the
stipulation.
and
congress,
whatever
it
has
done
with
the
bankruptcy
code,
has
provided
in
the
definition
sections
on
lien
and
judicial
lien
an
all-encompassing
definition.
this
court's
decision--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
under
101
u.s.
code
subsection
32
a
judicial
lien
means
a
lien
obtained
by
judgment,
levy,
sequestration,
or
other
legal
or
equitable
process
or
proceeding.
a
number
of
lower
courts
in
situations
like
this
have
called
this
an
equitable
lien,
have
tried
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
judicial
lien.
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
come
here
and
suggest
that
it
isn't
a
judicial
lien,
because
it
was
a
lien
imposed
by
a
court
in
a
divorce
judgment,
and
that's
going
to
happen
whether
or
not
it's
a
stipulated
divorce
or,
like
this
case,
a
divorce
in
which
every
issue,
including
the
division
of
property,
was
contested.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
yes.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
your
honor,
the
definition
of
the
federal
statute,
and
to
be
precise
the
definition
of
the
phrase
"the
fixing
of
a
lien"
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and
of
course
we
contend
that
congress
used
the
phrase
"the
fixing
of"
for
a
very
deliberate
reason.
but
we
have
to
understand,
this
entire
debate
occurs
in--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--absolutely.
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
two
things,
two
things
that
intimately
involve
state
law
and
state
public
policy.
the
divorce
judge
said
to
the
parties
in
this
case
i
am
going
to
award
the
homestead
to
the
husband,
but
as
a
condition
of
that
award
i
am
going
to
make
it
subject
to
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
spouse,
the
petitioner
here,
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
fair
and
equitable
division
of
state
law.
that
very
much
is
a
creature
of
state
law
and
always
should
be.
the
second
state
law
issue
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
is
what
the
exemption
itself
means.
since
at
least
the
1898
bankruptcy
act,
congress
has
specifically
deferred
to
the
states
in
determining
what
the
exemptions
are.
the
homestead
exemption,
of
course,
is
just
the
most
common
exemption.
in
fact
for
most
families
it
may
well
be
the
most
important
exemption.
section
522
of
the
code
itself
provides
a
number
of
exemptions,
most
of
them
geared
to
state
law.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
under
state
law,
your
honor,
the
lien
fixed
at
the
moment
the
judge
entered
the
divorce
judgment.
in
fact
the
district
judge,
the
federal
district
judge
in
this
case,
found
that
the
title
interest
in
mr.
sanderfoot
and
the
lien
interest
in
ms.
farrey
were
created
simultaneously
in
the
same
document
in
the
same
divorce
judgment.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
justice
scalia,
if
mr.
sanderfoot
had
sole
title
to
the
house,
he
didn't,
but
if
he
did--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--and
then
the
divorce
court
in
its
judgment
awarded
a
lien,
imposed
a
lien
on
it,
then
we
would
probably
not
be
here
today
and
i
would
not
quarrel
with
the
court's
order
or
suggestion.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
no,
justice
scalia,
and
if
you'll
forgive
me,
i
do
want
to
quarrel
with
your
premise.
because
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
not
guarantee
that
divorce
judgments
are
equal
across
the
country,
even
though
virtually
every
state
now
provides
for
some
kind
of
equitable
50-50
division
subject
to
different
factors.
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
prevent
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
from
being
used
as
a
device
to
upset
a
fair
and
equitable
division.
there
should
not
be
any
confusion
on
this
point.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
if
the
husband
had
sole
title,
your
honor,
the
trial
judge
could
have,
and
no
doubt
woul
have,
taken
other
steps
to
correct
the
difficulty.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case.
justice
scalia's
hypothetical--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--justice
kennedy,
i
am
grateful
to
be
here
under
any
circumstances.
[laughter]
justice
scalia's
hypothetical--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--justice
scalia,
justice
kennedy
is
absolutely
correct.
and
as
we
make
clear,
i
think,
in
our
briefs,
wisconsin
law...
and
there
is
just
no
dispute
about
this...
wisconsin
law
provides
for
co-ownership
of
marital
property.
the
entire
marital
estate
is
co-owned.
and
that's
why
in
this
case
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
ms.
farrey
and
her
husband
held
the
title
as
joint
tenants,
tenants-in-common,
tenants
by
the
entirety,
or
some
other
device.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
both.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
yes,
sir.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
it
does
not.
in
addition,
in
1986,
effective
in
early
1986,
wisconsin
passed
a
form
of
marital
property
law
that
reinforces
the
statutory
and
case
law
that
up
to
then
had
made
precisely
that
point.
but
it's
your
theory
that
the
marital
community
is
really
an
entity
of
its
own
and
that
that
changes
when
there
is
a
divorce
decree
entered
and
the
property
is
dissolved...
and
the
property
is
distributed?
yes.
at
that
point
the
divorce
judge
has
to
make
a
decision
about
how
to
divide
this
property.
and
the
practical
problem
that
the
divorce
judge
faced
in
this
case
is
really
quite
commonplace.
this
family
had
a
home
and
some
land
in
hortonville,
wisconsin,
not
too
far
from
greenbay
and
appleton,
and
it
was
their
primary
asset.
it
may
have
been
their
only
asset
of
any
value.
yet
a
home
by
definition,
except
for
example
in
someone's
property
law
class,
is
indivisible.
and
the
judge
had
to
make
a
difficult
decision
of
to
whom
would
he
award
that
home.
he
chose
mr.
sanderfoot.
but
he
also
was
committed
to
making
a
precisely
even
distribution
of
the
marital
property.
this
divorce
judge
did
everything
right.
he
followed
state
law
to
the
letter.
and
ms.
farrey
walked
out
of
that
courtroom
thinking
that
she
had
gotten
as
best
she
could
get.
she
got
half
of
the
marital
estate,
and
what
could
be
better
than
a
lien,
a
security
interest
imposed
by
a
judge,
to
protect
that
interest.
it
was
better
than
a
mortgage
until,
of
course,
a
few
months
later
mr.
sanderfoot
began
the
bankruptcy
process,
filed
a
motion
under
522(f),
had
that
motion
denied
by
the
bankruptcy
judge,
and
then
in
relatively
quick
succession
reversed
by
the
federal
district
judge,
and
in
a
2
to
1
decision
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
the...
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
the
respondent's
brief
they
were
unable
to
cite
a
single
case
pre-code
in
which
this
happened,
although
under
section
67(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
it
certainly
could
have
happened.
our
contention
is
that
when
congress
overhauled
the
bankruptcy
code
it
in
effect
replaced
67(a)
with
522(f)(1)
and
this
interesting
phrase,
the
fixing
of
a
lien.
it
also
replaced
67(a)
with
section
547
of
the
code,
which
are
the
comprehensive
preference
powers
of
the
trustee.
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
squarely
presented
the
issue
of
the
phrase
"the
fixing
of".
of
course,
the
court
may
touch
on
this
issue
in
another
case
that
it
heard
argued
on
november
5,
owen
v.
owen,
involving
a
florida
case.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
no,
sir.
the
single
paragraph
that
you
have
referred
to
from
the
legislative
history
is
the
only
substantive
reference
in
all
the
debate,
in
all
the
committee
hearing,
to
this
phrase.
it's
our
contention,
chough,
sir,
that
the
phrase
"the
fixing
of"
has
to
mean
something.
it's
an
active
phrase.
it's
not
passive.
and
mr.
sanderfoot
would
have
us
ignore
the
phrase.
he
would
have
the
statute
read,
and
i'll
read
it
without
the
phrase,
congress
simply
would
have
provided,
mr.
sanderfoot
suggests,
that
the
debtor
may
avoid
a
lien
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor.
that's
mr.
sanderfoot's...
position.
but
that's
not
what
the
code
says.
it
uses
the
phrase
"the
fixing
of".
our
contention,
of
course,
is
that
it
has
to
have
been
a
fixing
on
an
interest
that
the
debtor
previously
held.
now,
mr.
sanderfoot
had
an
interest
in
the
homestead
equivalent
to
ms.
farrey's
interest
in
the
homestead
pre-divorce.
but
that's
not
what
the
lien
attached
to.
the
lien
attached
to
the
entire
interest.
and
mr.
sanderfoot
would
not
have
received
that
entire
interest
but
for
the
lien.
now--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--well,
we
have
thought
about
that
possibility,
your
honor,
and
in
the
first
place
it
assumes
that
ms.
farrey
could
have
had
a
lien
on
her
own
interest
which,
whatever
the
doctrine
of
merger
might
say,
seems,
seems
a
bit
awkward
to
have
a
lien
on
your
own
interest.
but
it
is
possible
for
the
divorce
judge
to
have
said
i
will
place
a
lien
on
mr.
sanderfoot's
half
interest.
could
have,
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
and
it
would
have
been
unnatural
for
that
to
have
happened
here
because
everything
about
this
divorce
case
was
ordinary,
everything
about
this
divorce
case
was
done
by
the
book
under
state
law,
until
it
got
to
the
bankruptcy
process.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
yes,
you
could.
keep
in
mind,
justice
scalia,
that
in
this
case
the
federal
district
judge
who
overruled,
reversed
the
bankruptcy
court
judge,
found
that
what
had
happened
under
state
law
was
that
the
divorce
decree
eliminated
everybody's
interest,
and
then
in
a
split
second,
upon
the
entry
of
the
order,
created
new
interests.
and
mr.
sanderfoot
walked
out
of
the
courtroom,
not
literally
but
in
effect,
owning
the
entire
homestead
subject
to
the
lien.
as
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
seventh
circuit
put
it,
there
was
not
an
instant
that
mr.
sanderfoot
owned
title
without
the
lien.
and
that's
really
a
critical,
in
fact
dispositive,
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
probably
not.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
two
differences.
one
is
a
matter
of
law.
what
we
had
here
under
state
law
was
co-ownership.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
it's
clear,
justice
kennedy,
and
has
been
for,
probably
since
the
state
became
a
state
in
1848,
that
wisconsin
has
recognized
a
marital
estate
as
being
co-owned.
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that,
there
are
cases...
case
after
case
from
the
state
supreme
court
that
say
just
that.
the
other
factor...
that's
the
legal
explanation.
the
other
explanation,
the
other
response
is
practical.
this
was
a
man
and
a
woman,
a
husband
and
a
wife,
who
owned
the
home,
maintained
the
home.
in
fact
they
built
the
home
together.
this
was
not
an
arms-length
commercial
transaction,
not
a
household
finance
deal,
which
somebody
bought
a
refrigerator
and
had
a
purchased
money
security
interest.
this
was
two
equals
who
came
to
the
court,
asked
for
a
division
of
their
property,
and
got
it,
evenly,
equally.
but
again,
3
months
later
the
bankruptcy
process
began,
and
the
reason
we're
here
is
to
ask
this
court
to
determine
the
impact
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
on
state
divorce
law.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
no,
sir.
the
opinion
was
written
by,
i
believe,
a
district
judge
at
the
time,
judge
ripple.
the
dissenting
justice...
judge,
of
course,
was
judge
posner
from
chicago.
none
of
the
judges
had
a
wisconsin
connection,
although
they
made
specific
references,
as
indeed
they
should
have,
to
state
law.
this
case
is
about
the
intersection
of
state
law
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
justice
white,
not,
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
absolutely.
i
think
the--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--it
would
not,
justice
stevens,
under
section
523(a)(5).
but
that's
precisely
the
point.
congress,
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
when
it
has
chosen
to
effect
state
divorce
law
has
done
so
explicitly,
directly,
and
clearly.
section
523(a)(5)
is
a
perfect
example.
what
mr.
sanderfoot
has
asked
us
to
do
here
is
to
accept
the
suggestion
that
congress
made
a
deliberate
decision
to
impose
federal
policy
on
the
states,
to
increase
the
workload
of
the
federal
judiciary,
all
by
implication.
because
there
is
not
the
slightest
piece
of
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
any
idea
this
would
be
the
result.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
and
since
at
least
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898,
probably
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1867
as
well,
this
court
in
a
series
of
decisions
has
made
it
clear
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
debt,
which
may
be
discharged,
and
the
security
for
that
debt.
let
me
use
this
case
as
a
perfect
example.
when
ms.
farrey
and
mr.
sanderfoot
went
to
the
savings
and
loan
to
borrow
money
for
the
house
they
signed
a
mortgage.
that
mortgage
remains
a
record.
that
mortgage
remains
an
obligation,
an
encumbrance
on
the
homestead.
and
neither
federal
bankruptcy
law
nor
state
law
of
any
kind
would
permit
that
mortgage
to
be
expunged,
to
be
discharged,
to
be
exempted.
yet
we
have
jeanne
farrey,
who
was
a
partner
in
the
marriage
for
20
years,
and
her
interest,
the
lien
she
thought
she
had,
is
expunged
like
that
by
the
bankruptcy
process.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
your
honor,
in
522(c)(2)(a)(i)
congress
has
codified
the
principle
that
this
court
established
in
the
bullard
case,
which
says
that
security,
valid
security
interests
pass
through
bankruptcy.
again,
the
savings
and
loan
mortgage
in
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
the
savings
and
loan
is
going
to
get
paid,
and
if
it
doesn't
get
paid
it's
going
to
foreclose
on
its
mortgage,
have
the
home
sold,
and
then
it'll
get
paid.
but
because
of
the
bankruptcy
process
jeanne
farrey
doesn't
have
that
same
alternative.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
no,
sir.
because
it
is
a
valid
security
interest.
and
again,
this
court
has
said
in
bullard,
a
case
in
the
19th
century,
and
in
a
number
of
cases
since
then,
that
security
interests
survive
bankruptcy;
they
pass
through.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
your
honor,
clearly
congress
could
have
done
that,
but
we
believe
that
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
there
is
plenty
of
legislative
history
on
this
point,
supports
the
conclusion
of
congress
and
our
contention
that
there
was
no
need
for
that
kind
of
language
because
security
interests,
like
mortgages,
always
survive
bankruptcy.
they
are
not
dischargeable.
the
personal
obligation
may
not
be
enforceable.
that's
what
we
believe
dischargeability
means.
but
the
underlying
security
survives.
it
remains
attached
to
the
real
estate.
i
believe,
sir,
that
that's
a
cardinal
principle
of
bankruptcy,
and
it's
certainly
a
cardinal
point
in
our
argument.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
justice
scalia,
the
difficulty
is
that
congress,
in
defining
a
security
interest,
limited
it,
and
it's
in
subsection
47
of
the
definitional
sections,
limited
that
interest
to
consensual
liens.
it
defined
a
lien,
defined
a
judicial
lien,
and
it
defined
a
security
interest.
even
if
this
were
a
security
interest
it's
hard
to
escape
the
fact
that
it
was
a
security
interest
imposed
in
a
judicial
proceeding
which,
i
believe
unfortunately,
makes
it
a
judicial
lien.
we
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
and
that
it
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
bankruptcy
court
which
properly
refused
to
avoid
jeanne
farrey's
homestead
lien
against
her
family's
homestead.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
of
opinion
in
this
case.
jeanne
farrey
is
not
just
a
creditor.
she
and
gerald
sanderfoot
shared
a
marriage,
a
home,
a
marital
estate,
for
20
years.
and
to
suggest
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
treat
someone
in
that
position
like
a
savings
and
loan
or
household
finance
is
to
ignore
reality.
faced
with
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
the
divorce
courts
of
this
country
seeking
to
protect
the
interests
of
spouses,
men
and
women,
will
be
left
with
few
if
any
choices.
the
state
court
could
order
the
home
sold
immediately,
divide
the
cash,
50-50.
everybody
walks
away,
no
liens.
what
about
the
children?
what
if
there
are
young
children?
should
we...
should
we
promote
a
policy
that
forces
children
cut
of
a
family
home?
mr.
samson
has
suggested
for
his
client
that
the
state
could
order
the
title
to
the
home
held
jointly.
people
in
a
divorce
can't
agree
on
a
marriage.
how
are
they
going
to
agree
on
who's
going
to
pay
to
fix
the
furnace?
this
simply
would
perpetuate
and
compound
the
problem.
finally,
how
does
that
spouse
who
leaves
the
home,
man
or
woman,
come
up
with
the
equity
or
the
cash
to
establish
her
own
homestead
or
his
own
homestead?
the
respondent
concedes
that
the
result
in
this
case
is...
so
far
at
least,
has
been
harsh.
it
has
been
more
than
harsh.
it
has
been
unconscionable.
and
as
devastating
as
those
consequences
have
been
for
jeanne
farrey,
they
will
be
no
less
devastating
for
the
judicial
system
of
this
country,
federal
and
state.
the
chief
justice
has
already
expressed
his
concerns
about
the
growing
number
of
bankruptcies,
personal
bankruptcies.
this
can
only
compound
that
burden.
we
ask
again
that
the
court
reverse--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--there
is
none--
mr.
brady
c.
williamson
--i
am
aware
of
none
introduced
at
this
point,
your
honor.
that
concludes
my
arguments,
mr.
chief
justice.
