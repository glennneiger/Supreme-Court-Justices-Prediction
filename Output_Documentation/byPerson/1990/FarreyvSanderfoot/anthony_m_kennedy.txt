justice
kennedy
insofar
as
future
cases...
it
may
be
of
no
help
to
your
client
or
many
others
in
her
position.
so
far
as
future
cases,
if
the
court
had
anticipated
this
could
it
have
just
ordered
the
husband
to
execute
a
mortgage
on
the
property?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
settled
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
kennedy
on
that
point,
i
thought
wisconsin
law
was
quite
specific
that
all
property
of
the
spouses
xx
presumed
to
be
marital
property,
and
that
each
spouse
has
an
undivided
one-half
interest.
so
isn't
that
true
despite
the
state
of
the
title?
justice
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
why
you
conceded
to
justice
scalia,
then,
that
if
the
property
had
all
been
in
the
husband's
name
you
wouldn't
be
here
today.
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
very
much
the
same
argument.
justice
kennedy
i
thought
you
weren't
going
to
be
here
at
all.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
could
you
say
that
the
lien
fixed
part
on
his
interest
and
part
on
her
interest,
both
of
which
are
recognized
as
being
one-half
interest,
and
that
one
is
avoidable
and
the
other
is
not?
justice
kennedy
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
there
were
two
tenants-in-common,
not
husband
and
wife,
and
there
was
a
partition
suit
and
the
court
ordered
a
sale
from
one
to
the
other?
justice
kennedy
what's
the
difference?
justice
kennedy
that's
the
one
i'm
interested
in.
justice
kennedy
or
vice
versa.
justice
kennedy
is
either
party,
is
either
spouse
free
to
alienate
his
or
her
share
of
the
marital
property
during
marriage?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
seems
to
me,
then,
to
illustrate
justice
scalia's
point
that
there
is
something
to
the
argument
that
the
nature
of
the
property
changed
in
a
very
substantive
and
generic
way
at
the
moment
of
the
marital
dissolution.
justice
kennedy
and
he
received
property
with
a
new
character,
but
at
that
very
moment
it
also
had
a
lien.
justice
kennedy
of
course,
then,
if
she
had
gone
bankrupt
the
home
would
have
had
to
have
been
sold.
so
we
still
have
the
problem
of
homes
being
involuntarily
sold
because
of
the
bankrupt...
bankruptcy
of,
in
this
case,
the
party
that
didn't
get
the
property.
justice
kennedy
is
an
explanation
that
the
lien
might
still
exist
on
other
property,
so
that
the
lien
itself
still
remains
but
the
fixing
of
the
lien
on
the
interest
of
the
debtor
is
avoided?
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
or
not.
justice
kennedy
did
his
property
interest...
did
he
have
a
property
interest
that
survived
the
divorce?
justice
kennedy
did...
but
she
did
not?
justice
kennedy
and
where
did
that
interest
go?
justice
kennedy
yes.
and
so
that
was
a
new
transfer,
and
he
took
it
subject
to
the
lien
at
that
time.
justice
kennedy
the
statute
talks
about
interests,
not
properties.
