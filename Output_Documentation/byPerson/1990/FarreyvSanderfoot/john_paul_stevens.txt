justice
stevens
mr.
williamson,
can
i
ask
you
a
background
question?
under
the
old
bankruptcy
code
we
had
this
4
month
rule,
that
liens
within
the
4
month
period
could
be
avoided.
and
that
seems
to
have
gone
up
in
thin
air
somewhere.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
it.
but
are
there
any
cases
under
the
old
code
where
this
sequence
was
filed...
of
course
here
there
was
more
than
4
months,
but
where
this
series...
sequence
of
events
was
followed
within
a
4-month
period,
where
the
bankruptcy
occurred
less
than
4
months
after
the
divorce?
justice
stevens
one
reason
i
asked
the
question
is
i
don't
know
what
this
word
4
month
period,
but
then
the
4
months
just
isn't
there
anymore.
if
it
meant
fixing
after
the
bankruptcy,
obviously
you
win.
if
it
means
ever
fixed,
is...
which
i
gather
your
opponent...
it's
a
strange
use
of
words.
it's
a
fixing
of
a
lien.
is
there
any...
and
the
other
thing
that's
puzzling
about
it,
they
talk,
a
very
brief
excerpt
from
the
legislative
history
talking
about
the
rush
to
the
courthouse
and
so
forth,
but
there's
no
time
limit
on
the
rush
in
the
statute,
is
there?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
tells
us
what
happened
to
the
4-month
period
or
why
they
got
rid
of
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
how
about
alimony
or
support
money?
that
wouldn't
be
discharged,
would
it?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
it's
so
improbable.
say
when
he
bought
this
property
it
had
a
mortgage
on
it,
he
bought
it
subject
to
the
mortgage.
there's
also
a
lien
on
the
property
because
there's
a
judgment
against
the
prior
owner
for
$1,000.
why
wouldn't
you
sometimes
buy
property
subject
to
those
two
liens?
i
don't
know
why
that's
impossible.
justice
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
i
don't
know
why
the
plain
language
of
the
code
would
have
a
different
impact
in
that
situation.
justice
stevens
if
fixing
means
fixed
at
any
time
in
the
past.
if
fixing
refers
to
some
limited
period,
like
4
months
or
after
bankruptcy,
of
course
they
are
different.
justice
stevens
what
in
the
code
justifies
that?
what
language
of
the
code
do
you
rely
on
for
that
position?
justice
stevens
you
just
think
it's
common
sense
that
it
can't
apply
that
far.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
look
at
the
date
of
the
filing,
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
look
at
the
fixing
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
too.
i
think
that
argument
proves
too
much
for
you.
because
if
you
look
at
everything
at
the
date
of
the
filing,
you
say
you're
only
concerned
about
post-filing
fixing.
now,
i
understand
there's
another
objection,
the
automatic
stay--
justice
stevens
--but
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
tension
between
your
saying
well,
for
fixing
purposes
we
go
back
100
years,
but
for,
to
cancel
out
all
old
judicial
liens,
but
for
measuring
what
we're
talking
about
we
look
at
the
date
of
filing.
i
think
there's
some
tension
there.
justice
stevens
well,
why
does
it
use
the
word
avoid
the
fixing
of?
that's
a
strange
way
to
describe
the
concept
of
avoiding
liens
previously
fixed.
justice
stevens
on
legislative
intent,
what
do
you
do
with
the
snippet
from
the
legislative
history
about
rush
to
the
courthouse?
justice
stevens
but
my
question
was
what
do
you
do
with
the
snippet
of
legislative
history,
and
you
say
it
really
is
inconsistent
with
what
they
did?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
it's
inconsistent
with
what
they
did
and
with
what
they
intended
to
do
is
really
what
you're--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
know
if
there's
any
legislation
pending
in
congress
to
clarify
this
mess?
justice
stevens
because
the
statute
really
is
very
ambiguous
in
this
whole
area.
there
isn't
any
you
know
of?
