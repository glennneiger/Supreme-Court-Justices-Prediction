justice
scalia
mr.
williamson,
i
am
not
sure
that
our
job
here
ought,
you
know...
the
job
before
us
is
to
make
all
these
divorce
proceedings
come
out
in
a
seemingly
fair
and
happy
fashion.
but
even
if
that
were
our
task,
i
don't
see
how
your
theory
of
the
case
achieves
it
any
better
than
the
other
side.
would
it
not
be
the
case
that
even
if
we
accept
your
principal
theory,
if
the
husband...
if
the
property
was
in
the
husband's
name
and
then
this
same
thing
happened,
it
was
not
in
their
joint
names,
it
was
solely
in
his
name,
and
if
there
is
no
state
law
that
automatically
gives
the
wife
a
joint
tenancy,
then
your
theory
of
the
case
would
still
allow
the
husband
to
get
off
scott
free,
as
happened
here.
wouldn't
that
be
the
case,
because
it
would
not
have
fixed...
right?
he
would
have
had
the
property
before
the
lien
was
fixed.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
right.
so
the
point
is
that
your
prologue
about
how,
you
know,
not
going
along
with
you
will
make
for
unfair
divorce
proceedings,
really
sort
of
misses
the
point,
because
no
matter
what
you
do
you're
going
to
have
some
unfair
divorce
proceedings,
even
on
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
scalia
you're
not
saying
that.
you're
saying
it
shouldn't
be
used
to
upset
a
fair
division
unless
the
husband
has
sole
title
to
the
property
from
the
outset.
then
it
can
be
used
to
upset
a
fair
division.
right?
justice
scalia
you
pushed
me
beyond
my
hypothetical.
i
said,
i
said
assuming
that
the
state
did
not
have
an
such
law,
and
you
sort
of
volunteered
that
wisconsin
did.
and
i
don't
know
whether
wisconsin
does
or
doesn't,
frankly.
justice
scalia
legally
co-owned
or
equitably
co-owned?
justice
scalia
legally
co-owned?
justice
scalia
so
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
you
take
it
out
in
your
own
name
or
not.
justice
scalia
i
guess
you
say
that
a
whole
interest
in
real
estate,
a
whole
fee
interest,
is
equivalent
to
two
divisible
half
interests,
but
it's
a
different
interest
from
two
indivisible
half
interests?
to
have
an
indivisible
half
interest
in
property
is
simply
a
different,
different
estate.
it's
not
half
of
the
fee.
if
it
were
half
of
the
fee
you
could
say
that
he
did
have
the
interest,
even
before
the
decree
was
entered,
couldn't
you?
justice
scalia
i
guess
they
should
have
written
the
statute
differently,
because
the
statute
does
not
say
that
mortgages
can
be
discharged,
and
it
says
that
judicial
liens
can.
i
mean,
that
may
well
be
an
inequity,
but
that's
what
the
language
says.
why
does
it
say
that
mortgages
can't
but
judicial
liens
can?
do
you
have
any
idea
why
that
is?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
isn't
a
judicial
lien
a
security
interest?
it's...
i
mean,
you
get
a
judgment
and
you
get
a
judicial
lien
as
security
for
the
payment
of
that
judgment.
that's
a
security
interest.
justice
scalia
mr.
samson,
am
i
correct
that
you
acknowledge
that
if
mr.
sanderfoot
had
bought
this
real
estate
subject
to
a
judicial
lien,
there
was
already
a
judicial
lien
on
it
against
the
former...
to
secure
a
debt
of
the
former
owner,
he
buys
the
real
estate
with
a
judicial
lien,
he
could
not
get
that
lien
discharged
in
bankruptcy?
is
that
correct?
justice
scalia
because
he
had
no
interest
when
the
lien
fixed.
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no.
if
he
purchased
the
property
from
someone...
let
me
make
it
easier.
suppose
sanderfoot,
who
had
a
lien
against
the
property,
a
judicial
lien
against
it,
had
sold
the
property
to
a
third
person,
and
then
that
third
person
went
bankrupt.
the
third
person
having
purchased
the
property
with
a
lien,
subject
to
the
lien,
would
that
third
person
have
been
able
to
remove
the
lien
in
bankruptcy?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
say
it
was
a
warranty
deed.
he...
it
was
a
quit
claim.
justice
scalia
sure.
justice
scalia
but
the
new
owner
would
not
be
able
to
avoid
that
lien
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
because
the
lien
did
not
fix
upon
any
interest
of
that
new
owner.
correct?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
that
even
if
i
buy
property
that's
already
subject
to
a
lien,
the
lien
has
never
attached
to
any
interest
of
mine;
it
attached
to
somebody
else's
interest
and
then
i
bought
that
interest
already
subject
to
the
lien,
i
can
get
rid
of
that
in
bankruptcy?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
i
didn't
think
you
believed
so.
why
not,
under
the
plain
language
of
the
code?
justice
scalia
no,
but
neither
is
mrs....
the
petitioner's
lien
a
debt.
it's
security
for
a
debt.
see,
mr.
samson,
i
thought
the
reason
you
said
it
is
that
there
was
no
lien
fixed
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor.
that's
what
the
code
says.
the
debtor
may
avoid
the
fixing
of
a
lien
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor.
and
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
that
lien
had
never
fixed
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor.
justice
scalia
right.
okay.
now,
i
haven't
even
gotten
to
my
question.
i'm
just
trying...
if
that
is
so,
really
all
we're
arguing
about
in
this
case,
i
guess,
is
whether
for
purposes
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
law
the...
it
should
be
deemed
that
your
client
got
the
property
simultaneously
with
the,
with
the
judgment
lien,
or
did
he
get
the
property
first
and
then
the
judgment
lien
in
the
next
split
second
attached
to
the
property.
i
suppose
that's,
that's
really
the
theory.
because
if
he
got
the
property
first
and
then
the
lien
attached
he
could
avoid
it,
but
if
he
sort
of
took
the
property
with
the
lien
already
there
he
couldn't.
isn't...
i
mean,
that's
what
it
comes
down
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
understand.
well,
he
had
a
half
interest.
i
am
still
not
sure
why
the
lien
can't
be
avoided
on
the
interest
that
he
received
from
the
wife
but
not
on
his.
justice
scalia
mr.
samson,
let
me
try
again.
i
guess
we're
all
agreed
that
if
the
lien
attaches
before
you
acquire
the
property
it
cannot
be
discharged.
if
it
attaches
after
you
acquire
the
property,
or
fixes
after
you
acquire
the
property,
it
can.
and
we're
faced
here
with
a
situation
right
in
the
middle.
it's
simultaneous.
and
we're
trying
to
figure
out
how
the
bankruptcy
code
would
treat
that.
why
shouldn't
i
be
guided
by
the
fact
that
under
(f)(1)(2)
the
code
makes
it
clear
that
it
does
not
want
to
allow
the
discharge
of
purchased
money
security
interests,
that
is
to
say
even
though
you
can
get
out
of
security
interests
in
personal
property,
all
sorts
of
it,
you
cannot
get
out
of
purchased
money
security
interests
in
personal
property.
now,
why
shouldn't
i
think
that
the
code
feels
the
same
way
about
real
estate,
that
basically
where
there
is
a
simultaneously,
a
simultaneous
creation
of
your
interest
and
the
lien,
which
is
what
happens
with
a
purchased
money
security
interest,
you
should
not
be
able
to
get
out
of
it?
don't
you
think
that
the
drafters
of
the
code,
the
people
who
did
(f)(2)
would
have
felt
that
way
about
the
question
before
us,
that
this
is
sort
of
a
purchased
money-type
arrangement?
justice
scalia
oh,
i'm
not
saying
it
technically
comes
within
it.
i'm
just
saying
it's
the
same
philosophy
if
it's,
you
know,
the
simultaneous
fixing
of
the
lien
with
the
acquiring
of
the
interest.
justice
scalia
so
you
just
read
it
out?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
your
theory,
congress
might
as
well
have
said
instead
of
the
fixing
of
a
lien
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor,
they
might
as
well...
the
debtor
may
avoid
a
lien
on
an
interest
in
property.
but
they
didn't
say
that.
justice
scalia
--mr.
samson,
can
i
come
back
to
this
language
again,
it
has
to
be
a
fixing
of
a
lien
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor
in
property,
and
you
say
it
can
be
any
interest
of
the
debtor.
well,
surely
it
has
to
be
an
interest
that
he
now
possesses,
or
that
he
possesses
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy?
justice
scalia
right?
because
there's
no
problem
about
avoiding
the
lien
on
property
he
doesn't
possess.
justice
scalia
okay.
and
so
the
point
is
did
he
possess
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
an
undivided
interest
in
the
entire
property?
