justice
o'connor
well,
as
the
case
comes
to
us
you
concede
that
it's
a
judicial
lien?
justice
o'connor
and
we
have
to
worry,
then,
about
the
meaning
of
section
522(f)
and
how
that
plays
out
in
this
context,
right?
justice
o'connor
at
bottom,
is
that
a
matter
of
state
law
as
to
when
the
lien
fixes?
and
what
is
the
state
law
here
that
would
determining
the
fixing,
when
the
lien
fixed?
justice
o'connor
don't
you
think
the
federal
law
of
necessity
refers
back
to
state
law
as
to
when
and
how
a
lien
is
fixed?
justice
o'connor
yeah,
but
could
you
answer
my
question
and
tell
me
under
state
law
exactly
when
the
lien
was
fixed
here?
