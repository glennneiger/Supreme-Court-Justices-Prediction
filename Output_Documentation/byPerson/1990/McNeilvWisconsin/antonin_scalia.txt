justice
antonin
scalia
petitioner
here,
paul
mcneil,
was
charged
with
armed
robbery
in
west
allis,
wisconsin.
at
his
bail
hearing,
a
public
defender
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
while
he
was
in
jail
on
that
charge,
mcneil
was
approached
by
police
about
an
unrelated
crime,
a
murder
in
caledonia,
wisconsin.
before
beginning
the
questioning,
the
police
advised
mcneil
of
his
miranda
rights
which
he
expressly
waived.
he
then
proceeded
to
make
statements
incriminating
himself
in
the
caledonia
murder
and
was
subsequently
charged
with
that
crime.
the
trial
court
ruled
mcneil’s
statements
admissible
and
he
was
convicted.
on
appeal,
mcneil
argued
that
his
request
for
a
public
defender
at
the
bail
hearing
on
the
west
allis
armed
robbery
charge
should
be
construed
as
an
invocation
of
his
miranda
right
to
counsel
which
under
this
court’s
precedents
would
automatically
render
invalid
his
subsequent
express
waiver
of
his
miranda
rights.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
rejected
that
claim.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
an
accused's
invocation
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
during
a
judicial
proceeding
does
not
constitute
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel
that
this
court
derived
in
miranda
from
the
fifth
amendment’s
guarantee
against
compelled
self-incrimination.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent
which
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
