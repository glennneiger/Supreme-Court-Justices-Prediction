mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is...
is
we
believe
is
more
narrow
than
some
of
the
discussion
has
indicated.
it
is
whether
anything
that
happened
in
petitioner's
first
appearance...
a
first
appearance
that
is
fairly
typical
of
proceedings
that
occur
many,
many
times
each
day
around
the
united
states...
is
fairly
regarded
as
a
basis
for
triggering
edwards
no-waiver
presumption.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
triggering
of
edwards
in
this
situation
for
two
basic
reasons.
first,
applying
a
presumption
that
an
otherwise
valid
waiver
of
miranda
rights
is
a
product
of
coercion
is
not
necessary
in
this
situation
to
protect
the
individual's
free
exercise
of
his
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination.
and
that
after
all
is
the
purpose
of
all
the
miranda
rules.
secondly,
that
sort
of
a
rule
would
needlessly
undercut
the
other
interest
which
factors
into
the
miranda
complex
and
that
is
the
public's
interest
in
the
effective
investigation
of...
of
crimes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
because
the
difficulty
is
that
the
magistrate
follows
the
same
procedure
regardless
of
whether
the
individual
is
in
custody
or
not
in
custody.
so
nothing
typically
occurs
at
a
first
appearance
which
is
tailored
to
the
situation
of
the--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
if
the
arraigning
magistrate
gives
that
advice
so
that
the
defendant's--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
think
it
would
be
a
stronger
case,
because
then
the
gentleman
clearly
understands
that
he
has
the
freedom
to
resist
the
police
if
he
so
chooses.
it
would
be
a
protection
in
addition
to
the
miranda
warnings
that
he
will
receive
if
and
when
he--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
so.
it's
important,
i
think,
to
recognize
that
edwards
is
a...
is
a
rather
extraordinary
rule.
it
provides
that
an
otherwise
completely
valid
waiver
of
a
miranda
right
to
counsel
is
rendered
invalid
by
virtue
of
the
circumstances
that
have
occurred
before.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
it's
important
to
limit
the
edwards
rules
to
those
situations
in
which
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
something
has
occurred
to
cast
doubt
on
the
defendant
or
the
suspect's
ability
to
exercise
his
free
choice
when
he
is
given
miranda
warnings
and
simply
asked,
are
you
prepared
to
talk
to
us
without
a
lawyer
present?
and
there
really
is
nothing
that
happens...
happened
in
this
case
or
in
many
similar
cases...
that
cast
doubt
on...
on
mr.
mcneil's
ability
to
make
that
sort
of
free
choice.
all
that
happened
in
his...
his
first
appearance
was
that
the
case
was
called.
the
charges
were
explained.
the
defendant
indicated
that
he
understood
the
charges.
there
was
a
brief
colloquy,
a
setting
of
bail,
a
waiver
of
the
reading
of
the
complaint,
and
the
setting
of
a
preliminary
hearing.
there
was
nothing
in
that
proceeding
that
touched
on
what
mr.
mcneil
might
wish
to
do
or
say
if
the
time
came
when
he
was
questioned
in
custody
about
offenses
which
after
all
had
occurred
in
a
different
jurisdiction
and
were
not
the
subject
of
this
proceeding
at
all.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
no,
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
under
michigan
v.
jackson,
the
state
will
have
to
go
through
the
lawyer
with
respect
to
the
offenses
that
are
charged
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
effect
of
the
rule
that
petitioner
advocates
is
that
once
you've
appeared
with
a
lawyer,
the
state
can't
go
back
to
you
without
your
lawyer
present.
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
that
petitioner
argues
for.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
same
offense.
sixth
amendment--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--the
issue--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
issue
that
you're
addressing
is
what
the
scope
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
that's
invoked
by
virtue
of
an
appearance
with
an
attorney
at
the
first
appearance.
but
this
case
involves
is
whether
the
defendant
has
done
or
said
anything
that
justifies
relieving
him
of
a
subsequent
valid
waiver
of
fifth
amendment
rights
in
this
case
with
respect
to
a
different
crime.
but
the
case
you've
been
addressing
concerns
the
scope
of
the...
the
definition
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
that
is
defendant's
by
virtue
of
an
appearance
with
an
attorney,
not
what
sorts
of
events
trigger
the
miranda
right
to
counsel,
and
more
specifically
the
second
layer
of
protection...
the
edwards
rule.
there
is
a
certain
artificiality
in
discussing
this
case
in
terms
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
as
such.
petitioner's
attorney
has
put
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
footnote
in
the
jackson
case
that
ordinarily
individuals
don't
understand
the
difference
between
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendment.
and
i
agree
if
you
put
the
question
in
those
terms,
you
may
get
a
good
number
of
blank
stares
from
your
average
criminal
defendant.
but
the...
but
if
you
put
the
question
in
layman's
terms;
do
you
understand
the
difference
between
being
represented
in
a
pending
criminal
case
with
respect
to
charges
that
have
been
brought
against
you
by
the
state,
and
being
represented
with
respect
to
a
questioning
that
may
or
may
not
occur
with
respect
to
other
offenses
that
may
have
occurred
in
other
jurisdictions.
i
submit
that
the
average
defendant
understands
that
distinction.
and
if
asked
upon
leaving
a
first
amend...
first
appearance,
well
which
right
to
counsel
have
you
just
enjoyed?
many,
if
not
all,
would
say,
i've
just
enjoyed
my
right
to
be
represented
in
that
pending
case.
and
taking
it
one
step
further,
the
fact
that...
let's
assume
there
may
be
some
people
who
might
be
somewhat
confused
about
that...
each
of
these
people
at
a
subsequent
stage
is
going
to
get
a
set
of
miranda
warnings
in
which
he
is
told
or
she
is
told,
you
have
a
right
to
an
attorney
during
questioning.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
we've
assumed
that
for
purposes
of
the
case
and
because
so
much
weight
has
been
put
on--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
don't
believe
the
court's
past
cases
compelled
that
conclusion.
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
poses
a
number
of
difficulties.
can
you
invoke
your
rights
with
respect
to
questioning
about
offenses
that
may
not
have
occurred?
a
defendant
brought
into
custody
may
not
get
out
of
jail
in...
for
a
good
number
of
years,
and
during
that
period
of
time
he
may
be
transferred
from
place
to
place.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
no,
i...
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
thus
far
this
court
has
restricted
the
edwards
rule
to
a
narrow
core
set
of
cases,
a
paradigm--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
believe
that
a...
that
a
living
will
sort
of
invocation...
a
rote
invocation
of
the
right
to
the
fifth
amendment
for
all
purposes
for
all
time,
would
not
necessarily
be
regarded
as
binding
under
this
court's
precedence.
