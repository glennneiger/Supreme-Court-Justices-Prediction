unknown
speaker
that's
the
appearance
of
may
22nd
that's
set
forth
in
the...
joint
appendix
at
page
8?
unknown
speaker
is
it...
is
it
the
practice
in
this
state
for
magistrates
to
advise
suspects
generally
of
their
rights?
i
see
that
wasn't
done
here.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
requirement
in
the
wisconsin
statute--
unknown
speaker
--that
this
be
done
by
the
arraigning
officer?
unknown
speaker
did
the
robbery
take
place
in
the
city
of
milwaukee?
unknown
speaker
and
the
homicide
had
occurred
in
caledonia
in
racine
county?
unknown
speaker
none
of
those...
neither
of
those
scenarios
happened,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
suspect,
after
being
advised
of
his
rights
says,
i
want
a
counsel.
i
want
an
attorney;
but
i'm
pleased
to
talk
with
you
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
principle
is
that
the
mere
request
for
or
invocation
of
right
to
counsel
is
not
in
all
respects
tantamount
to
an
exercise
of
your
fifth
amendment
rights.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
how...
how
did
the
lawyer
get
in
the
picture
here?
unknown
speaker
does
it
have...
does
it
have
to
be
shown
that...
that
the
indigent
wants
the
lawyer
to
appear
with
him?
unknown
speaker
mr.
luck,
what...
what
happens
under
your
theory
if
a...
if
a
defendant
requests
counsel,
he's
given
counsel,
and
then
he's
released
on
bail.
and
while
he's
out
on
bail,
he
commits
another
crime.
he's
arrested.
he's
brought
in.
waives
his
miranda
rights
and
confesses.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
u.s.
erie
protect
him?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
break
in
the
custody
that's--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
he
stabs
somebody
while
he's
in
custody,
and
they
question
him
about
that
incident?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
break
the...
that
doesn't
break
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
did
the
defendant
actually
do
in
this
case
to
invoke
his
right
to
counsel?
he
had
an
appearance
before
a
magistrate
in
milwaukee
county.
unknown
speaker
and
did
he
say
anything
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
michigan
against
jackson
didn't
for...
specifically
left
open
the
question
that's
here,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's...
what's
artificial
about
that?
it
has
two
different
sources.
miranda
was
not
dependent
on
the
sixth
amendment
at
all.
it
was
dependent
on...
it's
a
entirely
different
amendment.
unknown
speaker
it
created
a
right
of
counsel
more
or
less
out
of
whole
cloth.
unknown
speaker
don't
you...
don't
you
think
the
basis
for
saying
that
in
the
miranda
context
that
when
the...
when
the
suspect
invokes
his
right
to
counsel...
don't
you
infer
from
that
that
he
is
saying,
i
don't
feel
competent
to
be
interrogated
without
counsel?
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
the
basis
for
the
rule--
unknown
speaker
--yeah.
unknown
speaker
then
that's
the
basis
for
saying
that
on
the...
the
police
can't
go
back
to
them
at
any
time
without
his...
without
being
asked
to
do
so.
because
he...
they
know
that
he
just
doesn't
feel
confident.
but
do
you
think...
do
you
make
that
same
inference
from
just
the
fact
that
appearing
in
court
with
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
say
yes
with
your
case
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
public
defender
goes
to
him
and...
and
talks
to
him
and
says,
do
you
want
me
to
appear
with
you?
it
might
help
you
out
a
little,
and
he
says,
sure.
unknown
speaker
he
says,
well,
i
want
you
to
represent
me...
i
want
you
to
represent
me.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
court
didn't
agree
with
me
in
minnick
though.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
dissent.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
shouldn't
your
rule
apply
to
interrogation
on
a
different
offense
that
this
counsel
is
not
involved
in?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
when
he
appears
on
a
particular
charge,
and
simply
stands
mute,
the
court
appoints
counsel
to
defend
him
on
that
charge,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
say
it's
not
in...
crime-specific
or
investigation-specific?
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
the
defendant
said
absolutely
nothing--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
isn't
up
to
the
defendant
to
decide.
it's
up
to
the
court
to
decide
what
the
appointment
constitutes.
unknown
speaker
no,
if
the
defendant
has
said
nothing...
if
the...
at
the
arraignment,
then--
unknown
speaker
--then
to
decide
what
the
scope
of
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
surely
depends
on
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
done
nothing.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that...
if
you
say
that
appearing
with
counsel
justifies
an
inference
that
i
don't...
justifies
an
inference
that
he's
saying
that
i'm
not
competent
to
deal
with
the
police
except
with
counsel.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
goes
to
any
offense.
unknown
speaker
at
least
that's
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
luck.
mr.
becker,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
his
lawyer
who
is
with
him
can
say...
ask
him,
and
by
the
way,
i
am
your
counsel
here
and
do
you...
do
you
expect...
do
you
want
to
have
counsel
at
any
other
time
the
police
may
want
to
interrogate
you?
and
he
says,
yes.
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
you.
you're
saying
to
me
that
if
the
lawyer
said
to
him,
would
you
feel
comfortable
without
a
lawyer
if
you
have
an
interrogation
in
custody,
and
he
answered
yes...
or
he
answered
no...
that
wouldn't
do
it?
he
can't...
he
can't
do
it
by
responding
to
a
question
from
his
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
i
would
assume
if
we
decide
the
case
your
way,
public
defenders
will
routinely,
when
they
make
a
public
appearance
like
that,
ask
their
clients
that
very
question.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
really
what's
at
stake
in
this
case
is
to...
what
procedure
will
lawyers
follow
in
the
future
at
procedures
such
as
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suppose
this
public
defender,
if
they
started
to
question
him
on
the
second
offense,
he
said
can
i
call
a
lawyer
and
ask
him?
he
called
up
that
public
defender,
and
he
said,
i'm
only
representing
you
on
charge
a
and
i
won't
talk
to
you.
is
that
the
way
your
public
defender's
office
works?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
that's
the
case,
it
shouldn't
really
matter...
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
all
right,
i
see
the
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you've
just...
if
the
defendant
himself
appears
and
he
said,
by
the
way,
judge,
i
want
everybody
to
know
that
i
don't
want
the
police
interrogating
me
about
anything
in
the
future
without
my
having
a
lawyer.
he
didn't
say
that
in
response
to
the
lawyer's
question,
but
he
just...
he's...
he's
been
there
before,
so
he...
he
knows
he
should
say
it,
and
he
says
it.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
say
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
suppose
that
if
you
follow
your
rule
i
have
to
back
off
the
notion
of
questioning.
but
the
lawyer
might
not
advise
him
that
it
would
be
in
your
best
interest
to
make
this
statement
to
the
court
during
the
hearing,
and
then
they
go
ahead
and
make
the
statement.
don't
you
think
that
would
happen
rather
frequently
in
the
future
if
we
adopt
your
rule?
unknown
speaker
--or
do
you
think
counsel
will
probably
figure
that's
ultra
vires,
so
you
never
give
the
defendant
that
advice?
unknown
speaker
depending
on
this
unusual
advice
that
you
probably
are
not
competent
to
deal
with
the
police
on
your
own.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
end...
the
end
result
of
your
argument
is...
is
that
if
the...
i
think
you
can
see
that
the
magistrate
here
didn't
go
through
the
full
panoply
of
what
usually
is
gone
through.
unknown
speaker
all
right...
all
right,
he'd
be
advising
of
the...
they
say
you
have
the
right
to
counsel.
unknown
speaker
and
the
fellow
says,
and
by
the
way,
i
certainly
want
counsel
and
i
don't
want
to
be
interrogated
about
anything
without
counsel
being
present.
and
the
judge
says,
awfully
sorry,
but
all
that...
that
will
be
true
with
respect
to
this
charge.
but
i
have
no
authority
and
you
have
no
authority
to
keep
the
police
away
from
you
with
respect
to
any
other
charge.
i
would
think
that's
the...
that's
exactly
what
you
have
to
be
arguing.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that
is
going
to
answer
my
question.
suppose
the
judge
says
that?
unknown
speaker
and
then
police
should
not--
unknown
speaker
--the
police
should
stay
away
from
him.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
i
didn't
know
that
we
were
adopting
rules.
i...
you
know,
i
really
thought
we
were
dealing
here
with
constitutional
rights.
i
mean
there...
you
talk
as
though
we're...
we're
writing
some
code
of
procedure
year
by
year.
you
know,
just
write
a
new
section
later
on
if
this
doesn't
work.
is
that
what
we're
doing?
unknown
speaker
enough,
enough...
you've
persuaded
me.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
mean
off
limits
without
advising
counsel?
unknown
speaker
assuming
counsel
advises
him
to
proceed
in
the
interrogation.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
could
always
get
around
the
rule
sought
by
the
defendant
here
if
you...
you
just
let
him
out
for
a
day
on
the
petty
crime
and
then
rearrest
him
on
the
more
serious
one.
well,
he'd
get
counsel
right
away
on
that
one,
too,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
this
very
case,
as
i
remember
the
facts,
they
were
already
investigating
him
on
the
second
crime.
and
if
they
arrest
him
on
the
minor
offense
first
in
order
to
get
him
into
custody
where
they
can
interrogate
him
more
effectively
on
the
second
crime,
then
it's
advantageous
for
law
enforcement
purposes
to
be
able
to
do
that
without
having
to
notify
counsel.
that's
what
they
do,
as
i
understand
it.
they
invest
him
on
the
less
serious
offense,
bring
him
into
custody,
and
then
you
want
to
question
him
on
the
more
serious
offense
which
was
under
investigation
at
the
time
of
the
first
arrest.
that's
a
typical
scenario,
too,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
unless...
if
they
let
him
out,
why
they
certainly
couldn't
interrogate
him
if
he
didn't
want
to
be
interrogated
without...
without
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
becker.
mr.
nightingale,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
would...
would
your
case
be
a
stronger
one
or
a
weaker
one
here
if
the
committee
magistrate
had
advised
the
defendant
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
and
asked
the
defendant
if
he
understood
that
advice?
or
would
the
case
be
just
the
same?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
saying
would
the
case
for
the
rule
you
propose
be
a
better
or
a
worse
case
if
the
arraigning
magistrate
had
given
that
advice?
unknown
speaker
he
just
advises
him
in
open
court
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
of
self-incrimination.
he
says,
do
you
understand
you
don't
have
to
talk
with
the
police,
and
the
suspect
says,
yes,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
and
if
his
attorney
had
told
him
the
same
thing,
it
would
also
be
a
stronger
case,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
ought
to
judge
the
case
sort
of
on
the
assumption
that
this
defendant
is
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm...
but...
but
otherwise
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
go
back
to
the
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that.
but
if
the
defendant
himself
was
a
lawyer,
and
he
appears
as
the
lawyer,
and
just
like
this
defendant,
i
suppose
that
if
we
rule
against
the
state,
the
police
can't
even
go
back
to
the
lawyer
for
interrogating
without
some
other
ground.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so,
certainly
the...
there
wouldn't
be
anything
happening
at...
and
a
lawyer-defendant's
attendance...
appearance
would
indicate
that
he
wouldn't
be
competent
to
deal
with
the
police
by
himself.
unknown
speaker
one
would
hope
so.
is
it...
is
it
your
position
that
the
police
are
not
permitted
to
interrogate
with
reference
to
the
same
investigation
or
the
same
offense?
unknown
speaker
felony
murder
and
he's
given
a...
a...
well,
i
guess
both...
that
would
be
both
robbery
and
the
murder.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
we
may
have
some
problems
in...
in
writing
the
case
the
way
you
propose--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
talk
just
about
the
legal
elements
of
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if...
do
you
concede
that
the...
that
the
defendant
could
when
he's
asked
about
do
you
understand
these
rights...
he
says,
i
not
only
understand
them,
but
i
exercise
my
rights
under
both
of
the
amendments.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you...
but...
what
is
the
government's
position?
could
he...
would
he
be
permitted
to
exercise
his
rights
under
the
fifth
at
a
first
appearance?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't...
you
don't
know
what
the
government's
position
about
that?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
the
government's
position?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
luck,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tommorow
at
ten
o'clock.
