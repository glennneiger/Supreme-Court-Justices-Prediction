mr.
gary
m.
luck
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
i
would
like
to
outline
them
briefly
and
then
propose
three
scenarios
that
support
mcneil's
proposed
rule
that
a
defendant
who
requests
or
appears
with
counsel
at
an
initial
appearance
may
not
be
questioned
by
police
while
he
remains
in
continuance
custody
unless
the
defendant
initiates
that
interrogation.
the
defendant
was
taken
into
custody
on
may
13th,
1987
in
omaha.
that
was
pursuant
to
a
milwaukee,
wisconsin
warrant
and
complaint
for
an
armed
robbery
which
had
occurred
in
the
milwaukee
jurisdiction.
he
waived
extradition.
on
may
20th,
after
being
held
in
continuous
custody
in
omaha,
he
was
taken
into
custody
by
two
milwaukee
deputy
sheriff
detectives.
at
the
time
that
they
took
him
into
custody,
they
advised
him
of
his
miranda
rights
from
a
written
text
which
is
used
by
the
sheriff's
department...
that's
in
the
appendix.
and
one
of
the
rights
read
to
him
was
if
you
cannot
afford
to
hire
a
lawyer,
one
will
be
appointed
to
represent
you
at
public
expense
before
or
during
any
questioning
if
you
so
choose.
mcneil
refused
to
make
a
statement
at
that
time
and
did
not
request
counsel.
he
was
accompanied
by
officers
that
day
in
a
search
of
omaha
for
a
codefendant
which
was
unsuccessful.
on
may
21st,
mcneil
was
transferred
to
the
omaha
airport
for
conveyance
back
to
milwaukee.
during
that
transportation,
detective
smukowski
of
the
milwaukee
sheriff's
department
advised
mcneil
that
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
if
he
would
tell
his
side
of
the
story
referring
to
the
armed
robbery
and
to
a
homicide
investigation
which
was
taking
place
involving
a
milwaukee
county
sheriff
by
the
name
of
butts
and
the
caledonia
police
department,
which
is
part
of
racine
county,
a
separate
jurisdiction
from
milwaukee
county.
smukowski,
after
advising
mcneil
that
it
would
be
in
his
interest
to
cooperate
and
tell
his
side
of
the
stories,
was
met
by
a
silence
from
the
part
of
mcneil.
he
did
not
make
any
statements
concerning
either
of
those
offenses.
mcneil
was
returned
to
milwaukee
on
the
evening
of
the
21st.
the
following
morning,
may
22nd,
which
was
a
friday,
he
was
brought
before
a
court
commissioner,
a
judicial
officer,
and
with
him
at
that
time
was
a
public
defender.
when
mcneil
appeared
at
the
initial
appearance,
he
was
advised
of
the
penalties
for
armed
robbery.
he
acknowledged
it
by
saying,
i
do,
when
he
was
asked
if
he
understood,
and
those
are
the
only
words
he
spoke
at
that
initial
appearance.
bail
was
set
at
$25,000
and
a
preliminary
examination
was
set.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
no,
unfortunately,
because
of
the
crush
of
cases
in
milwaukee
county,
sometimes
the
niceties
of
informing
defendants
of
their
full
panoply
of
rights,
which
they
might
get
from
a
federal
magistrate,
do
not
take
place.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
yes.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
there
are
requirements.
but
one
of
the
requirements
does
not
include...
i
ought
to
rephrase
that...
the
magistrate
is
not
required
to
advise
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
at
that
initial
appearance,
unlike
under
rule
5
in
the
federal
system.
the
magistrate
is
suppose
to
advise
the
defendant
of
the
charges
against
him,
of
his
right
to
counsel,
to
set
bail,
his
right
to
a
preliminary
examination.
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
text
of
that
initial
appearance,
you'll
notice
that
there's
really
a
colloquy
that
goes
on
between
defense
counsel
and
the
magistrate
and
the
only
participation
of
the
defendant
is
to
acknowledge
what
he
has
been
charged
with.
the...
to
push
that
a
little
further,
your
honor,
the
public
defender
has
a
meeting
with
the
defendants
in
milwaukee
county
prior
to
their
appearance...
at
the
initial
appearance,
albeit
a
perfunctory
meeting
in
a
small
room
off
to
the
side.
and
we
can
presume
that
that
occurred
before
the
appearance
before
the
magistrate.
after
this
exchange
took
place,
mcneil
was
returned
to
the
milwaukee
county
jail
where
he
was
held
continuously
until
that
evening
at
7:55
p.m.
when
detective
butts
of
the
milwaukee
sheriff's
department
went
to
see
mcneil
for
the
purposes
of
interrogating
him
about
the
armed
robbery,
and
according
to
his
testimony,
possibly
the
homicide.
keep
in
mind
that
detective
butts
had
been
involved
in
a
homicide
investigation
from
another
jurisdiction,
that
is,
racine
county,
because
he
had
informants
apparently
that
led
him
to
believe
that
mcneil
was
involved
in
that
racine
homicide.
as
a
result,
detective
butts
was
in
communication
with
police
authorities
from
racine
county
concerning
that
homicide.
so
when
he
went
to
see
mcneil
that
evening
at
7:55
p.m.
at
the
milwaukee
county
jail,
i
think
they
can
say
to
a
certainty
that
he
went
there
to
speak
to
him
about
the
armed
robbery
and
the
homicide.
when
he
arrived,
he
again
read
from
the
standard
milwaukee
county
sheriff's
department
text
concerning
miranda
rights,
which
is
in
the
appendix.
at
this
time,
mcneil
signed
a
waiver
of
his
rights
and
said
to
butts,
i
suppose
you
want
to
talk
about
that
thing
in
caledonia.
and
of
course,
butts
said
yes,
and
they
had
a
conversation
about
the
caledonia
homicide.
didn't
discuss
the
armed
robbery,
and
at
that
time
mcneil
gave
a
statement
that
was
totally
exculpatory.
detective
butts
testified
that
he
informed
mcneil
that
he
wasn't
satisfied
with
what
he
had
been
told
and
that
he
would
return.
he
returned
2
days
later
on
a
sunday
in
the
early
evening
hours
with
a
representative
of
the
caledonia
department
who
had
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
homicide
together
with,
between
three
or
four
city
of
milwaukee...
not
county
of
milwaukee...
city
of
milwaukee
detectives
from
the
homicide
division
with
expertise
in
the
area
of
homicide
interrogation.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
it
took
place
in
a
suburb
called
west
allis,
a
city
adjacent
to
milwaukee
but
part
of
milwaukee
county,
which
gave
jurisdiction
to
the
sheriff's
department.
ordinarily
you'd
think
that
maybe
west
allis
police
would
be
involved,
but
because
it
was
in
the
county
the
sheriff
was...
and
that's
how
butts
got
involved
in
the
homicide.
apparently
in
developing
his
investigation
of
the
armed
robbery,
he
received
information
concerning
the
homicide
passed
out
to
caledonia
and
remained
active.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
correct.
on
the
24th,
after
5
hours
of...
approximately
5
hours
of
meeting
in
the
early
to
late
evening
with
these
various
agencies,
mcneil
made
a
statement
that
was
heavily
inculpatory,
partially
exculpatory.
butts
was
still
not
satisfied,
said
he
was
going
to
come
back
again,
and
he
returned
2
days
later
on
a
tuesday
again
with
approximately
three
or
four
officers.
took
another
statement
after
approximately
an
hour
and
a
half
which
he
felt
was...
sewed
up
the
case,
let's
say.
consequent...
or
subsequent
to
that,
racine
county
issued
a
homicide
warrant
on
may
27th
and
mr.
mcneil
was
transferred
from
the
milwaukee
facility
to
racine,
where
he
was
subsequently
arraigned,
and
subsequently,
after
various
motions
to
suppress
the
statements
which
i've
alluded
to
were
denied,
he
entered
pleas
to
charges
of
second-degree
murder,
attempted
murder,
and
armed
burglary.
after
that,
motions
were
brought
to
bring
to
the
trial
court's
attention
the
seventh
circuit
case
of
espinoza
v.
fairman,
which
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
go
into
facts,
except
to
say
that
there's
a
tremendous
similarity
between
the
two
fact
situations.
and
at
that
time,
fairman
held
that
the
kinds
of
statements
that
had
been
developed
in
mcneil
should
have
been
suppressed.
the
trial
court
felt
that
even
if
that
case
had
been
brought
to
its
attention
during
the
pending
case,
it
would
have
had
the...
it
would
have
made
the
same
decision
that
the
statements
needn't
have
been
suppressed.
the
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
intermediate
appeals
level
in
wisconsin,
which
certified
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
because
they
felt
there
was
no
applicable
wisconsin
law.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
after
full
briefing
and
oral
argument,
felt
that
when
mcneil
appeared
at
the
initial
appearance,
it
was
purely
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
that
he
had
invoked
when
he
appeared
with
counsel.
they
use
the
word
transmutation,
and
they
say
that
it
is
not
possible
to
transmutate
the
sixth
amendment
into
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
reasoning
was
that
they
felt
that
there
was
no
interrogation
taking
place
at
the
initial
appearance,
and
in
the
absence
of
interrogation,
you
cannot
invoke
your
fifth
amendment
right.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
there's
three
scenarios
that
support
the
rule
that
we're
proposing.
the
first
is,
if
mr.
mcneil,
when
he
was
confronted
by
the
milwaukee
sheriffs
in
omaha
on
may
20th,
1987,
had,
after
being
advised
of
his
rights,
said,
i
want
an
attorney,
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
today.
and
i
think
the
state
and
the
united
states
would
agree
under
the
edwards
and
the
roberson
doctrines.
a
second
scenario
is
when
the
police
from
milwaukee
approached
mr.
mcneil,
if
he,
sui
sponte,
without
being
informed
by
the
police
of
his
miranda
rights,
had
said,
i
want
an
attorney,
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
today.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
absolutely
not,
judge,
they
did
not.
what
did
happen
was
an
invocation
of
right
to
counsel
with
a
variation
in
time
and
a
variation
in
place.
the
difference
is,
is
that
mcneil
waited
until
he
was
in
milwaukee
to
have
counsel
and
it
took
place
at
an
initial
appearance.
and
we
have
built
our
case,
your
honor,
around
the
edwards-roberson
doctrine
as
amplified
by
michigan
v.
jackson.
there
is
a
footnote
which
appears
in
our
briefs,
footnote
7,
where
in
jackson
this
court
said
that
jurists
may
understand
the
subtle
distinctions
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment,
but
when
an
average
person
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
he
does
not
know
which
constitutional
right
his
invocation
rests
upon.
all
he
knows
when
he
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
whether
it's
in
front
of
a
magistrate
or
a
police
officer,
is
that
he
needs
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
stand
between
him
and
his
adversaries,
be
they
the
prosecutor
or
the
police.
so
that's--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--well,
i
think
that
if...
if
we
take
connecticut
v.
earrett,
which
really
doesn't
amplify
it...
restates
the
rule
in
jackson
that
the
request
for
counsel
should
be
given
a
broad
rather
than
a
narrow
interpretation
and
that
it...
that
if
there's
a
plain
meaning
to
the
defendant's
invocation,
we
don't
have
to
move
to
that
type
of
interpretation.
therefore,
as
in
connecticut
and
barrett
where
the
person
said,
i'll
give
you
an
oral
statement,
but
i
want
a
counsel
for
a
written
statement,
the
court
said,
well,
that's
plain
on
its
face.
we
don't
have
to
interpret
that.
so
if
a
suspect
says,
i
want
an
attorney,
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you,
the
plain
meaning
there
would
be,
i
want
to
talk
to
you.
but
if
said,
i
want
an
attorney,
i
think
you
have
to
stop
right
there,
because
you
have
to
give
it
its
broadest
interpretation.
that's
not
the
scenario
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
scenario
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
appeared
in
court
with
his
counsel,
and
i
think
that
his
mere
appearance--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--well,
if
i
understand
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
it's
where
you
have
this
issue
of
how
do
you
interpret
that
invocation.
and
i
guess
i'm
going
back
to
connecticut
v.
barrett,
where
the
invocation
of
counsel
is
plain
on
its
face
as
to
what
it
is.
it
isn't
necessary
to
interpret
it.
it's
where
there's
ambiguity
that
you
have
to
interpret.
and
when
you
have
to
interpret,
this
court
has
said
you
give
it
a
broad
interpretation
when
you're
talking
about
the
request
for
counsel.
now,
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
argued
that
the
plain
meaning
of
an
appearance
with
a
defendant
at
an
initial
appearance
is
that
it's
the
sixth
amendment.
but
jackson
says
that
that's
not
so
clear.
that
when
a
defendant
appears
at
an
initial
appearance,
he
doesn't
know
whether
it's
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment.
he
wants
counsel.
therefore,
the
broad
interpretation
of
jackson,
because
it's
ambiguous,
that's
not
like
the
defendant
appearing
at
the
initial
appearance
and
saying,
judge,
yes,
i
want
a
lawyer
just
for
this
charge
and
only
for
this
charge
and
i
don't
need
his
help
when
i'm
interrogated
by
police.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
he
was
a
public
defender,
your
honor,
and
what...
the
procedure
in
wisconsin
is
is
that
the
public
defender
has
an
obligation
to
interview
all
persons
brought
into
custody
before
they
make
an
initial
appearance
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
they're
indigent.
if
a
person
is
indigent
and
wants
them
to
appear
with
them,
they
will
appear.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
it
doesn't
have
to
appear
on
the
record,
but
the
public
defender
will
not
appear
with
someone
who
does
not
want
counsel
or
says
to
them,
i
will
get
my
own
counsel.
then
that
person
will
appear
at
the
initial
appearance
by
themselves.
the
public
defender
may
say
at
that
time,
this
individual
want...
is
going
to
get
their
own
attorney.
we're
not
involved
in
the
case.
that's
not
on
the
record,
though,
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
i'm
not
presenting
it
as
though
it's
part
of
the
record.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
he's
in
big
trouble.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
because
the
break
in
custody--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--no,
because
under
roberson,
this
court
required...
it's
my
understanding...
continuous
custody
when--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--it's
a
break
in
the
custody
and--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--no.
he's
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
between
himself
and
police--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--no,
he's
still
in
custody.
we
see
the
magic
formula
as
being
in
custody,
having
invoked
a
right
to
counsel,
and
being
interrogated.
those
are
three
requirements
for
our
rule.
if
you
take
any
of
those
three
requirements,
our
rule
fails.
and
we
think
that
that
rule
falls
within
roberson.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
right.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
no,
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
and
that's
where
we
see
the
ambiguity.
the
united
states
has
suggested
that
they
agree
with
us
that
an
individual
can
invoke
his
right
to
miranda
in
a
noncustodial...
i'm
sorry...
in
a
noninterrogation
setting
much
as
this
court
said
in...
i
believe
it
was
the
chief
justice
who
wrote
that
opinion
in
michigan
v.
harvey...
that
it's
recognized
that
you
can
invoke
that
right
in
a
noninterrogation
setting.
they
simply
say
that
mcneil
didn't
do
it.
and
we're
saying
that
they're
disregarding
the
principle
in
jackson
that
when
a
person
appears
before
a
magistrate
and
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
he
doesn't
know
whether
it's
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment.
therefore,
the
court
has
to
give
a
broad
interpretation
to
the
immediate
situation.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
it
left...
absolutely...
left
open
the
fifth
amendment,
because
the
michigan
court
had
found
in
its
proceedings
that
the
fifth
amendment
had
been
waived.
this
court
specifically
said
they
don't
have
to
reach
that,
because
it's
sixth
amendment.
but
that
didn't
prevent
this
court
from
using
a
fifth
amendment
analysis
just
like
it
didn't
prevent
this
court
from
using
a
fifth
amendment
analysis
in
patterson.
because
basically
this
court
has
said,
we're
going
to
get
away
from
the
artificiality
of
saying,
this
right
to
counsel
comes
from
the
fifth
amendment.
this
right
to
counsel
comes
from
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
well,
except
that
the--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--right,
but
it
also
used
a
sixth
amendment
analysis
for
waiver.
just
as
in
patterson
you
used
a
fifth
amendment
analysis
for
waiver
in
the
sixth
amendment
context.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
i
think
that's
how...
that's
how--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--that's
how
edwards
rules,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
how
it
rules,
but
we
may--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--yes.
i
think
that
much--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--well,
i
base
that
not
just
on
the
necessity
to
say
yes,
but
on
the
practicalities
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
like
that,
where
he
says
it
might
help
you
out
a
little
bit.
he
says
that
you
have
a
right
to
counsel,
and
if
you
can't
afford
counsel,
we're
going
to
represent
you.
and
it
puts
that
defendant
in
the
same
position
as
the
individual
who
is--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--we
don't
know,
judge,
and
that's
why
footnote
7
in
jackson
is
so
important,
because
of
that
ambiguity.
because
what
we're
faced
with
when
the
united
states
agrees
that
that
invocation
can
take
place
at
the
initial
appearance...
it
says,
there's
going
to
be
a
colloquy
between
the
magistrate
and
the
defendant.
well,
what
do
you
mean
now?
do
you
want
this
attorney
for
your
fifth
amendment
rights
as
well
as
your
sixth
amendment
rights?
because
it's...
what's
going
to
happen,
judge...
i'm
sorry...
justice
white,
is
that
defense
counsel
throughout
this
country
are
going
to
learn...
i've
been
trained
where
i
do
most
of
my
work,
your
honor...
what's
going
to
happen
is
defense
counsel
throughout
this
country
who
keep
up
with
the
case
law
are
going
to
start
telling
their
clients
and
the
magistrates,
he's
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
no
one
can
come
and
talk
to
him
or
her.
the
only
ones
who
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
are
those
defendants
who
don't
appear
with
counsel.
then
we're
going
to
have
a
situation
of
people
raising
the
issue
later.
well,
i
meant
to
invoke
my
fifth
amendment
right.
what
the
united
states
has
proposed
is
is
that,
yes,
this
can
happen
at
the
initial
appearance.
but
we're
going
to
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
he
meant
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
we
say
that's
contrary
to
jackson.
it
says
the
burden's
on
the
state
and
that
the
courts
are
mandated
to
give
a
broad
interpretation
to
the
request
for
counsel,
not
a
narrow
one.
your
honor,
we
recognize
that
the...
we
are
proposing
a
new
rule
to
the
extent
that
the
rule
that
we're
proposing
is
in
the
context
which
has
not
arisen
before
this
court
before.
but
we
don't
think
it's
a
radical
departure.
i
think
that
justice
scalia
in
his
dissent
in
minnick
noted
that
the
request
for
counsel
at
the
jackson
situation
is
a
general
request
for
counsel.
and
when
you
combine
the
force
of
that
general
request
with
the
rules
developed
in
edwards
v.
roberson,
we
feel
that
we're
falling
within
the
logical
meaning
of
those
cases
when
they're
read
together.
your
honor,
to--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--i
guess--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--i
know.
your
honor,
the
united
states
has
recognized
in
their
own
brief
the
general
principles
that
i
have
laid
out
for
the
court.
and
i
think
that
the
only
differences...
they're
saying
that
these
should...
these
situations
should
be
examined
on
a
case-by-case
basis
instead
of
the
rule
that
we're
proposing,
which
is
a
bright
line
rule.
our
bright
line
rule
is
in
direct
distinction
or
counter
distinction
to
the
state's
proposed
bright
line
rule.
they
have
proposed
to
this
court
that
the
court
forbid
a
defendant
from
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
rights
at
an
initial
appearance.
it's
the
contrary
of
our
rule.
and
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me,
falls
somewhere
in
between
that.
and
we
feel
that
under
jackson,
the
wisconsin
proposed
rule
that
fifth
amendment
right
cannot
be
invoked
in
the...
at
the
initial
appearance
has
no
foundation
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
and
we
feel
that
our
bright
line
rule
meets
the
requirements
set
out
in
edwards
and
roberson
and
minnick
for
that
matter,
and
fulfills
all
the
needs...
in
fact,
has
less
impact
on
law
enforcement
than
those
decisions
did.
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
appeals--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--because
that
invocation
of
counsel...
because
it's
ambiguous
and
may
involve
the
fifth
amendment,
is
not
investigation-specific
any
more
than
the
invocation
of
counsel
under
roberson
as
this
court
found.
it's
not
investigation-specific.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
if
he
wants
counsel,
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
but
when--
mr.
gary
m.
luck
--because
there's
nothing
from
the
defendant
to
indicate
that.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
right.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
it's
up
to
the
defendant,
your
honor,
did
you
say?
mr.
gary
m.
luck
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
well,
i
don't...
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
in
that
situation
is
deciding
what
the
scope
of
the
defendant's
need
for
counsel
is.
when
the
defendant
appears
with
counsel
whether
it's
retained,
whether
some
attorney
walks
in
or
whether
it's
a
public
defender,
i
don't
think
is
relevant.
i
want
to
make
sure
i
say
that.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
right.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
that's
my
argument.
well,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
gary
m.
luck
both
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
it
seems
to
petitioner,
disregard
of
one
of
the
fundamental
purposes
of
miranda,
which
is
to
deal
with
the
question
of
custody
and
the
resulting
coercive
atmosphere
that
results
from
custody
when
it's
put
in
the
interrogation
setting,
and
which
this
court
most
recently
recognized
in
minnick.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
once
the
defendant
is
arraigned
or
appears
at
an
initial
appearance
and
has
bail
set
and
he's
indigent...
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
mcneil
was
never
going
to
make
bail.
he
was
indigent
and
he
had
$25,000
bond.
it's
unrealistic
to
think
that
the...
the
continued
custody
doesn't
work
on
an
increased
coercive
effect
on
the
ability
to
exercise
the
free
will
to
speak
or
not
to
speak.
he
is
not
in
the
same
position
as
a
suspect
in
the
police
station
who
has
just
been
arrested,
who
still
has
the
ability
to
not
be
charged
and
to
go
home.
he
already
is
incarcerated,
no
different
than
if
he
had
been
found
guilty,
except
that
he's
awaiting
trial
and
he
has
a
presumption
of
innocence.
but
he's
being
treated
like
a
prisoner
who's
already
been
found
guilty.
and
he
is
sitting
in
that
jail
cell
and
police
are
coming
to
see
him
on
two
or
three
different
occasions.
now,
miranda
recognizes
that,
and
miranda
said
that
if
the
suspect
indicates
in
any
manner
at
any
time
prior
to
or
during
interrogation
that
he
wishes
counsel,
there
shall
be
no
interrogation.
well,
he
indicated
in
a
manner
that
he
wanted
counsel
when
he
appeared
at
the
initial
appearance.
as
far
as
costs
and
benefits
are
concerned,
it's...
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
net
of
the
roberson
and
edwards
is
much
greater
than
the
net
of
what
we're
talking
about.
if
they
talk
about
the
number
of
individuals
who
have
been
charged
who
could
be
interrogated
in
the
jail
because
they've
committed
other
offenses,
think
of
all
those
individuals
who
were
in
the
police
station
who've
invoked
their
right
to
counsel
and
cannot
be
questioned
any
further.
i
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are,
but
we
know
it's
a
pyramid
and
the
number
of
people
who
are
taken
into
custody
are
not
equal
to
the
number
of
people
who
appear
in
court
and
they
have
bail
set.
i
think
it's
also
unrealistic
to
say
that
individuals
want
an
opportunity
to
explain
to
the
police
when
they're
sitting
in
a
jail
cell
about
how
they
weren't
involved
in
a
particular
offense.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
is
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
counsel
is
needed
in
the
custodial
setting
as
a
guiding
hand
to
assist
individuals,
to
enable
them
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
to
respond
to
questioning.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
defense
attorneys
are
not
necessarily
the
manipulators
that
counsel
indicates
they
are.
i
mean
this
court
is
well
aware
that
defense
counsel
can
also
serve
as
facilitators.
when
the
police
know
that
they
have
other
crimes,
they
contact
the
district
attorney,
who
contacts
the
defense
attorney,
who
says,
you
know,
we've
got
other
information
on
your
guy.
why
don't
you
go
talk
to
him?
and
you
know
something,
that
happens.
because
sometimes
the
defense
attorney
can
advise
and
consult
with
his
client
and
do
him
more
good
sometimes
to
have
him
cooperate,
than
when
he
tells
him
not
to.
and
it's
done
in
an
orderly
fashion
where
fundamental
rights
under
the
constitution
are
abided
by.
and
they
don't
take
place
in
jail
cells
when
the
defendant's
attorney
are
not
present.
finally,
we
feel
that
the...
the
rule
of
roberson
and
edwards
is
really
what
opposition
is
arguing
against,
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
really
when
counsel
is
invoked
and--
