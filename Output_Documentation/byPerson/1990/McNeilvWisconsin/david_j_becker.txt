mr.
david
j.
becker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
proceed
to
the
argument
that
i
prepared
to
present
this
morning,
i
think
i
want
to
clear
up
one
thing
with
respect
to
our
position.
mr.
luck
asserts
that
our
position
would
forbid
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
which
would
thereby
trigger
the
edwards
rule
at
a
court
appearance
on
a
charged
defense.
i
think
that
mischaracterizes
our
position.
and
in
making
that
characterization
of
our
position,
he
attempts
to
drive
a
wedge
between
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
our
position,
i
think,
and
the
solicitor
general's
position
really...
those
two
positions
are
identical.
all
we're
saying
is
that
if
a
defendant
makes
an
appearance
with
an
attorney
at
a
hearing
on
a
charged
offense,
he
does
not
thereby
or
as
i
think
is
stated
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
he
does
not
by
that
fact
alone
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
so
as
to
trigger
the
edwards
rule.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
a
defendant
could
not,
if
he
clearly
stated,
i
am
not
comfortable
in
dealing
with
the
police
in
a
custodial
interrogation
situation,
and
i
want
an
attorney
present
whenever
i
am
interrogated...
we're
not
suggesting
that
that
kind
of
a
request
could
not
come
at
any
stage
of
his
being
in
custody
whether
that
be
when
he's
in
the
custody
of
police
officers
or
when
he's
in
court.
mr.
david
j.
becker
i
suppose
he
could
do
that.
i
suppose
that
could
be
done.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
going
to
end
up
being
the
practice
if
this
court
rules
in
favor
of
the
state
in
this
case.
but
i
suppose
that
could
be
done.
i
think
there
might
still
remain
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that
would
invoke
the
protection
of
edwards,
because
i'm
not
so
sure...
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
really
sends
the
message
that
needs
to
be
sent
to
trigger
the
edwards
rule.
it
seems
the
message
that
needs
to
be
sent
is
a
message
from
the
defendant
himself.
that
knowing
that
what
he
is
about
to
be
subjected
to
what
this
court
has
characterized
as
the
inherently
coercive
pressures
of
custodial
interrogation,
he
does
not
feel
comfortable
in
dealing
with
the
police
singlehandedly
in
that
situation.
and
i
think
that
really
is
a
message
that
we
have
to--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--well,
i
guess
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
i
don't
see
that
situation
arising.
mr.
david
j.
becker
well,
i--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--well,
i'm
not
so
sure,
because
i'm
not
so
sure
that
a
defense
attorney
sees
his...
or
a
public
defender
or
a
private
attorney
who
is
representing
a
person
on
a
specific
charged
offense
sees
his
job
as
extending
beyond
the
representation
in
that
charged
defense
to
protecting
his
client
in
any
other
situations
to
which
he--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--that
may
well...
that
may
well
be,
because
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
public
defender
has
any
obligation
to
be
providing...
or
perhaps
even
any
right
to
be
providing...
representation
absent
the
filing
of
the
charges.
the
public
defender's
representation
is
to
provide
the
representation--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--i
think
the
obligation
that
we're
trying
to
fulfill
with
our
public
defender
system
is
the
a...
providing
the
representation
that
is
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
and
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
in
that
interrogation
that
you've
just
described.
mr.
david
j.
becker
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
knows
that
he
should
say
it.
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
it
that
happened
that
that
would
have
to
be...
that
would
be
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
david
j.
becker
well,
no,
i
realize
that.
but
if
he
says
that
i'm
uncomfortable
with
custodian
interrogation
about
any
crime
and
i'm
not
just
concerned
about
this
crime
that
i'm
appearing
before
you
on.
this...
as
a
practical
matter
though
that
doesn't
occur.
i
mean
defendants
now
know
that
they
have...
many
defendants
know
that
they
have
right
to
silence
and
rights
to
counsel,
but
they
aren't
standing
up
at
court
appearances
and
invoking
those
rights,
because
they
know
the
appropriate
place
to
invoke
those
rights
is
when
the...
when
the
situation
requires
it;
i.e.,
when
the
police
administer
the
miranda
warnings
in
anticipation
of
beginning
interrogation.
mr.
david
j.
becker
i--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--i
think
that
and
i
also
really
have
a
serious
question
whether
or
not...
if
that
were
to
turn
out
to
be
the
practice...
whether
this
court
could
really
feel
that
that
ought
to
be
the
kind
of
request
for
an
attorney's
representation
at
custodial
interrogation...
that
that
ought
to
be
the
kind
of
request
that
triggers
the
edwards
rule.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
really...
what
really
ought
to
trigger
edwards
and
what
the
record
really
ought
to
clearly
show
is
that
a
defendant
basically
on
his
own
has
come
to
that
conclusion.
i
don't
know
that
a
defendant
prompted
by
defense
counsel
really
raises
the
kind
of
concerns--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--well,
but
that's
advice
that
is
i
think
contrary
to
i
think
what...
what
underpins
miranda
and
edwards
and
all
the
rest,
and
that
is
that
the
defendant
generally
is
competent
to
deal
with
the
police
on
his
own
and
to
make
that
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
he
can
handle
custodial
interrogation
without
an
attorney
present
or
whether
or
not
he
does
feel
those
inherently
coercive
pressures
that
the
court
talked
about
in
miranda
and
has
talked
about
in
every
miranda
decision
since--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--well,
he
went
through
the
full
panoply
of
what
usually
goes
through...
what
is
usually
gone
through
in
wisconsin,
because
all
that
wisconsin
basically
requires
is
what
went
on
here,
and
that
is
that
the
judge
has
informed
the
defendant
of
the
charge...
of
his
right
to
counsel.
he
didn't
have
to
do
that,
because
he
had
counsel.
mr.
david
j.
becker
sure.
mr.
david
j.
becker
no,
i...
what
i'm
arguing
is
that,
number
one,
the
scenario
that
you
paint
i
don't
think
is
going
to
ever...
is
going
to
occur.
i
mean
we
don't
see
it
now.
i
don't
know
why
we
should
see
it
after
this
case
arises.
a
defendant
is
fully
capable
of
exercising
that
right
when
the
time
comes
to
exercise
it;
i.e.,
when
the
police
begin
their
questioning.
so
i
don't
think
it's
going
to--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--no,
i
don't
think
a
judge
is
going
to
say
that,
because
i
think
perhaps
in
that
situation
where
a
defendant
not
coached
by
an
attorney
but
truly
because
he
feels
that
he's
incapable
of
dealing
with
custodial
interrogation
without
an
attorney
makes
that
assertion
in
the
context
of
a
court
hearing,
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
treat--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--then
the
police
should
not
interrogate.
mr.
david
j.
becker
then
the
police
should
stay
away
from
him.
i
don't
see
that
situation
arising.
it
hasn't
arisen
so
far
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
going
to
arise
in
the
future.
and
i
think
that
you're...
that
basically
i
think
what
this
court
has
to
do
is
to...
is
to
reach
the
right
result
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
its
prior
precedent.
and...
and
adopt
the
rule
that
properly
reflects
the
law,
and
then
if
it
turns
out
that
there
are
ways
in
which
smart
defense
attorneys
can
somehow
manipulate
that
rule
so
as
to
perhaps
arguably
get
around
it,
then
this
court
is
going
to
have
to,
down
the
road,
be
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
allow
that
kind
of
manipulation.
but
i
think
we
have
to
take
this
one
step
at
a
time,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
any
reason
not
to
adopt
a
rule
that
it--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--i
think
to
a
large
extent
that
when
you're...
when
we're
in
the
area
of
the
prophylactic
rights
that
have
been
developed
under
miranda,
your
description
comes
very
close
to
what
this
court
is
doing.
it
adopts
the
edwards
rule.
it
then
proceeds
to
adopt
the
michigan
v.
jackson
rule
of
saying
edwards
now
applies
in
the
sixth
amendment
context.
then
in
roberson
it
has
to
decide
how
far
edwards
goes
with
respect
to
uncharged
offenses.
now
it's
being
asked
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
jackson
situation
should
also
trigger
the
roberson
rule.
i...
i
think
probably
you--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--and
i
think
you've...
you've
hit
on
something
though
here.
what...
what
is
really
being
requested
here
is
an
extension
of
a
prophylactic
rule.
and
i
think
that
when...
when
we're
talking
about
that
that
really
there's
some
burden
that
is
on
the
person
who
is
seeking
that
extension
to
justify
it.
and
while
i
don't
think
it's
possible
in
the
time
that
i
have
remaining
here
in
my
argument
probably
to
fully
develop
the
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
is...
a
showing
has
been
made
that
the
rule
should
be
extended
so
that
edwards...
edwards-roberson
rule
should
apply
in
this
situation
whether
your
request
for
counsel
comes
not
in
the
context
of
custodian
interrogation
but
rather
in
the
context
of
a
court
appearance,
that
the...
and...
and
when
that
request
for
counsel
then
is
going
to
bar
interrogation
with
respect
to
uncharged
offenses,
i
think
that
what
this
court
has
to
do
is
basically
a
cost-benefit
analysis.
and
i
don't
think
that
once
you
weigh
the
costs
against
the
benefits
that
you
really
will
find
a
persuasive
case
made
for
the
extension
that
is
being
sought.
and
in
that
regard,
i'd
like
to
address
the
two...
the
two
prongs
of
that
analysis...
the
costs
and
the
benefits
of
an
extension
of
the
edwards-roberson
rule
to
the
present
situation.
the
costs
we
would
submit
would
be
exceedingly
high.
as
a
practical
matter
what
you
would
be
basically
holding
is
once
a
defendant
is
charged
with
a
crime,
he
is,
from
that
point
on,
off
limits
to
police-initiated
interrogation
as
long
as
he
remains
in
custody.
and
he's
off
limits
to
police-initiated
interrogation
not
only
with
respect
to
that
charged
crime,
but
also
with
respect
to
any
other
crimes.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
i
say
that
because
almost
immediately
after
a
charge
is
made
you're
going
to
have
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
and
you're
going
to
have
that
invocation
in
one
of
two
ways.
you're
either
going
to
have
it
the
way
it
was
done
here
where
you
have
a
public
defender
system
in
place
that
basically
provides
attorneys
who
will
make
an
appearance
at
the
initial
court
proceeding.
and
that
will
obviously
have
to
be
deemed
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
or
you'll
have
the
situation
that
you
have
in
other
states
where
you
do
not
have
a
public
defender
system
in
place
necessarily
or
the
public
defender
does
not
arrive
on
the
scene
quite
as
quickly
as
he
does
in
wisconsin,
where
you'll
have
a
court
making
inquiry
at
initial
appearance
as
to
the
defendant's
wishes
with
regard
to
counsel
which
will,
in
the
normal
course,
it
would
seem
to
me,
invoke
a
request
for
counsel.
and
so,
as
a
practical
matter
as
i
indicated,
what
you're
going
to
be
doing
is
you're
going
to
be
saying
that
as
soon
as
a
defendant
is
charged
with
a
crime,
he
is
going
to
become
off
limits
for
police-initiated
interrogation
with
respect
to
any
offense.
mr.
david
j.
becker
exactly.
obviously
i'm
speaking
a
little
bit
in
shorthand
here
against
the
backdrop
of
all
the
decisions.
they're
obviously...
if
they're
ready
to
provide
counsel
and
have
counsel
present
at
the
interrogation,
the
interrogation
could
proceed.
now,
why
do
i
say--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--which,
as
i
think
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
purporting
from
justice
jackson's
earlier
opinion,
that
isn't
very
likely
to
happen.
and
when
i
say
you
pointed
out,
i'm
talking
about
your
dissent
in
minnick.
the...
now
why
do
i
say
that
that's
going
to
be...
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
effective
law
enforcement?
well,
i
think
we
all
know...
i
think
common
sense
and...
and
experience
teach...
teach
us
that
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
roberson,
it
is
not
a
rare
situation
that
a
defendant
charged
with
one
offense
is
a
suspect
with
regard
to
other
offenses.
and
if
you
need
some
kind
of
empirical
data
to
support
that,
i
would
suggest
that
you
go
and
read...
if
you
haven't
done
so
already...
the
brief
amicus
filed
by
the
illinois
attorney
general's
office.
i
do...
i
think
they
do
a
marvelous
job
of
showing
just
what
kind
of
an
impact...
or
just
how
often,
rather,
this
kind
of
situation
arises
and
how
often
it
arises
in
very
serious
cases.
because
defendants
are
arrested
for
some...
very
often
for
very
petty
crimes.
but
as
a
result
of
investigation,
they...
they
are...
they
become
suspects
relatively
quickly
in
very
serious
crimes.
and
i
think
the
situation--
mr.
david
j.
becker
--well,
not
necessarily
if
you...
if
you
arrested
him
for
purposes
of
interrogation
and
didn't...
didn't
bring
him
before
the
court.
you'd
have
a...
there
would
be
a
little
leeway
in
there.
mr.
david
j.
becker
yeah,
i
think
that
is
sometimes
the...
the
scenario.
mr.
david
j.
becker
that's
true.
i
mean
they'd
have...
they'd
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
on
that
second
offense,
and
which
he
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
suspect
which
of
course
raises
the
whole
problem
of
whether
or
not
it's
not
in
the
defendant's
interest
perhaps
to
have...
to
be
questioned
about
these
other
crimes
that
he's
suspected
of,
because
he
may
be
able
to
clear
himself
of
all
suspicion.
the...
the
situation
in
that
regard,
by
the
way,
that
a...
that
a
suspect
charged
with
one
offense
may
well
turn
out
to
be
a...
a
person
charged
with
one
offense
may
turn
out
to
be
a
suspect
in
other
offenses,
i
think
has
only
become
exacerbated
as
we
see
the...
with
the
advent
of
these
computerized
fingerprint
matching
systems
which
i
think
are
going
to
result
in
even
more
cases
in...
in
which
we
are
able
to,
as
a
result
of
arrest
on
one
charge
and...
and
bringing
him
to...
and
bringing
those
charges
before
the
court,
we
are
going
to
find
out
that
this
fellow
may
have
been
involved
in
other
activity
about
which
we
would
want
to
question
him.
and
what
the...
what
the
defendant's
proposed
extension
of...
of
the
edwards
rule
would
do
then
would
be,
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
that
i
have
described,
would
be
to
borrow
what
this
court
has
labeled
absolutely
essential
activity
in
the
enforcement
of
our
criminal
laws.
the
essential
activity
being
noncoercive
questioning
in
counsel's
absence
with
a
view
toward
obtaining
a
voluntary
statement
where
the
defendant
admits
his
guilt
of
the
crime
of
which
he's
suspected.
now,
that
interference
might
be
tolerable
if
there
was
a
significant
benefit
to
be
gained
by
the
extension
of
the
rule
that
the
defendant
proposes.
and
our
position
would
be
that
there
really
is
not
much
of
a
benefit.
the
edwards
rule
is...
is
designed
to
protect
against
police
badgering.
i
think
the
apparent
concern
of
this
court...
it
was
certainly
the
concern
that
justice
kennedy
identified
as
the
apparent
concern
of
this
court
in
his
dissent
in
roberson...
is
that
if
you...
if
you
go
ahead
an
interrogate
the
guy
after
he's
requested
an
attorney...
and
we're
talking
about
a
situation
in
edwards
where
he
requested
an
attorney
during
the
course
of
custodial
interrogation...
if
you
go
ahead
and
reinitiate
interrogation,
the
defendant
is
going
to
wonder,
do
i
really
have
a
right
to
counsel?
i
mean
didn't
i
invoke
this
right.
why
didn't
that
result
in
something?
why
isn't
that
attorney
here
now
to
assist
me?
why
are
they
starting
this
questioning
over
again?
i
don't
think
that
describes
how
a
defendant
would
view
the
situation
when
he
has
appeared
in
court
with
counsel
on
a
charged
offense,
and
then
the
police
approach
him
to
interrogate
him
with
respect
to
a
completely
separate
and
distinct
offense.
i
don't
think
he
perceives
that
as
being
inconsistent
with
what
happened
there
in
court,
because
i
think
a
normal
defendant
perceives
that
what
happened
there
in
court
was
that
he
had
the...
an
attorney
to
represent
him
on
that
charged
offense.
and...
and
i
don't
think
he
perceives
it
to
be
inconsistent
when
he
is
questioned
about
completely
separate
and
distinct
offenses
that
that...
he
does
not
perceive
that
to
be
inconsistent
with
his
appearance
with
counsel
on
the
charged
offense.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
really
much
of
a
benefit
to
be
gained.
and
with
the
terrific
cost
in
terms
of
the
detriment
on
effective
law
enforcement,
i
don't
think
a
case
can
be
made
for
an
extension
of
the
edwards
rule
in
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
has
requested--
