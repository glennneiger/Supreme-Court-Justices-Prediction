mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
issued
two
rulings
adverse
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
first,
on
the
mortgage
swap
issue
as
just
discussed
in
the
cottage
savings
case,
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
with
the
united
states
that
there
was
a
materially
different
requirement
in
the
tax
law.
it
then
disagreed
with
the
united
states
on
application
of
that
requirement,
concluding
that
these
mortgage...
these
pools
of
substantially
identical
mortgage
loans
were
in
fact
an
exchange
of
property
that
is
materially
different.
the
second,
unrelated
issue,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
when
centennial's
depositors
incurred
a
penalty
under
federal
law
for
early
withdrawal
of
their
savings
from
certificates
of
deposit
and
centennial
deducted
that
penalty
from
the
savings
before
turning
them
over,
that
the
depositors
were
actually
discharging
their
savings
and
loan
of
part
of
its
obligation
to
them.
that
meant
that
the
income
to
centennial
was
entitled
to
special
deferred
treatment
under
section
108
of
the
code.
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
with
its...
in
its
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
mortgage
swap
issue,
and
it
was
wrong
in
its
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
section
108
issue,
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
mortgage
swap
issue
are
not,
to
coin
a
phrase,
materially
different
from
the
facts
in
the
cottage
savings
case.
in
april
of
1981
centennial
and
a
trading
partner
decided
to
enter
into
one
of
these
swaps.
they
plugged
their
mortgage
loan
portfolios
into
the
computer,
came
up
with
$8.5
million
in
book
value
of
loans
that
matched.
centennial
then
sold
its
loans
to
its
partner
for
$5,662,045,
and
its
partner
sold
its
loan
to
centennial
for
$5,662,043.
conducted
no
independent
valuation
of
the
loans,
applied
a
common
discount
factor.
if
the
loans
matched
up,
they
were
worth
the
same.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
one
comes
out
the
same
way
as
the
cottage
savings
case,
your
honor.
[laughter]
centennial,
because--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there's
not
a
material
difference
in
the
two
cases
on
this
issue.
centennial
reported
no
loss
to
the
bank
board,
deducted
a
$2.8
million
loss
on
its
tax
return,
which
the
commissioner
disallowed
for
failure
to
satisfy
the
materially
different
requirement.
for
reasons
i
have
already
stated,
the
commissioner's
decision
is
correct.
the
r-49
match-up
ensured
that
the
loans
that
were
given
up
were
substantially
identical
to
those
that
centennial
got
back.
the
differences
in
borrowers
and
collateral
were
not
a
material
difference
because
the
parties
to
this
transaction
in
this
market
didn't
consider
those
significant.
in
fact,
centennial
conducted
no
credit
checks,
performed
no
appraisals
of
property.
it
didn't
even
know
who
the
borrowers
were
at
the
time
of
the
transaction.
it
didn't
get
the
files
on
the
loans
until
6
years
later.
the
market
also
regarded
these
now-claimed
differences
as
not
material.
in
this
case,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
district
court
found
as
fact
that
the
secondary
mortgage
market
was
unable
to
and
did
not
differentiate
between
these
pools
of
loans
on
the
basis
of
the
borrowers
and
the
collateral.
a
contrary
conclusion
would
require
overturning
that
factual
finding.
the
fifth
circuit,
which
concluded
that
the
loans
were
materially
different,
did
so
because
of
its
view
of
the
nature
of
this
transaction
and
this
type
of
property.
it
disregarded
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
as
to
what
the
market
was
like
and
what
the
property
was
like.
the
second
issue
presented
in
this
case
concerns
the
treatment
of
income
that
centennial
received
when
its
depositors
paid
penalties
required
by
federal
law
for
the
early
withdrawal
of
their
savings.
in
1981
centennial
had
income
of
over
$250,000
from
such
penalties.
centennial
claims
that
this
is
income
by
the
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness,
and
therefore
entitled
to
special
deferred
treatment
under
section
108
of
the
code.
it
is
not.
it
is
income
by
reason
of
the
receipt
of
a
penalty,
a
penalty
mandated
by
federal
law.
the
fact
that
centennial
used
an
offset
as
a
method
of
paying
the
penalty
doesn't
mean
that
the
loan
was
at
any
extent
forgiven.
it
simply
means
that
that
was
the
method
of
payment
that
they
used.
now,
in
a
typical
income
from
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
case,
if
i
loan
you
$1,000,
payable
in
2
months,
and
then
after
6
weeks,
for
reasons
of
my
own,
i
need
the
money
early,
i
have
doubt
about
your
ability
to
pay
at
the
end
of
the
term,
we
get
together
and
agree
to
call
it
quits
if
you
pay
me
$800.
in
that
situation,
you
have
$200
of
income
by
reason
of
my
forgiving
you
that
much
of
your
debt.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
label
you
put
on
it
would
not
make
a
difference.
in
your
hypothetical,
however,
that
would
not
be
income
from
the
discharge
of
indebtedness.
it
would
be
income
from
the
receipt
of
the
liquidated
damages
that
we'd
agreed
to
prior
to
the
transaction.
the
key
question
is
whether
there
is
one
obligation
or
two
obligations.
in
the
case
that
i
put,
where
all
we
know
is
that
you
owe
me
$1,000,
payable
in
2
weeks,
and
we
agree
to
lower
the
debt,
i
forgive
some
of
the
debt,
there
is
only
one
obligation.
the
only
obligation
is
yours
to
pay
me
$1,000
in
2
weeks.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
case
that
you
pose,
and
in
this
case,
there
are
two
obligations:
your
obligation
to
pay
back
the
$1,000,
and
my
obligation
which
we
agreed
to
prior
to
the
transaction
to
pay
$200
if
i
want
the
money
back
early.
the
language
of
the
statute,
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness,
looks
to
the
source
of
the
income
that's
received.
in
your
case
you
have
$200
income
because
you
received
the
damages
we
agreed
to,
or
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
penalty.
i
was
obligated
to
you
to
pay
that.
the
fact
that
there
was
a
condition
precedent
to
triggering
the
obligation
of
my
wanting
my
money
back
doesn't
alter
the
fact
that
there
are
two
separate
obligations.
and
that's
the
case
here.
when
the
depositors
put
their
money
in
the
s&l,
under
federal
law
they
had
an
obligation
if
they
withdrew
it
early
to
pay
a
penalty.
two
separate
obligations.
obligation
of
the
s&l
to
pay
them
their
money
back
with
the
agreed
interest--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
it...
if
you
attempted
to
withdraw
your
money
very
early
in
a
longer-term
cd
you
would
forfeit
some
of
the
principal.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding...
the
current,
the
1981
federal
regulation
provided
that
if
you
had
a
certificate
of
deposit
for
more...
the
term
of
which
was
more
than
3
months,
and
you
withdrew
the
amount
prior
to
the
expiration
of
3
months,
you
would
forfeit
not
just
the
interest
that
had
been
earned,
but
all
the
interest
that
could
have
been
earned.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
wouldn't--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i...
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
you
would
forfeit
all
the
interest
that
would
be
earned
for
3
months.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
withdrew
that
after
2
days
you
wouldn't
have
any
of
that
interest
yet.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
that's
what
it's
measured
by.
but
it
would
in
effect
have
to
come
out
of
some
of
your
principal.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
here,
if
you
deposited
$1,000
for
3
months,
and
over
that
time
it's
going
to
earn
$30
in
interest.
and
you
withdraw
it
back
at
the
end
of
2
days,
you've
got
to
pay
a
penalty
of
$30
in
interest.
so
all
you're
going
to
get
back
is
$970.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what's
provided
in
the
1981
regulation,
which
sets
that
as
the
minimum
penalty.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
in
the
record.
it's
not
reproduced
anywhere
in
the
briefs.
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
centennial...
centennial
argues
that
there
is
income
by
reason
of
indebtedness
in
this
case
because
the
penalty
would
not
have
arisen
but
for
the
depositor
seeking
to
withdraw
his
funds
earlier.
and
that's
true.
the
obligation
is
conditioned
upon
that
event.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
"but
for".
it
says
"by
reason
of",
and
that
language
looks
to
the
source
of
the
income.
here
the
source
of
the
income
is
the
penalty
obligation,
not
any
discharge
of
indebtedness.
when
the
depositor
withdraws
his
funds
early,
he
is
not
saying
to
the
s&l
i
forgive
you
whatever
the
amount
of
the
penalty
is
that
you
owe
me.
he's
saying
give
me
my
money
back.
and
the
s&l
says
before
i
can
do
that
you
have
an
obligation
under
these
circumstances
to
pay
a
penalty.
that's
the
way
that
the
irs
treated
this
transaction
in
the
1973
revenue
ruling
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
it
said
there
is
two
separate
transactions,
the
crediting
of
interest
and
the
payment
of
the
penalty.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
within
the
108
as
it
stood
at
the
time.
it's
been
changed
since
then.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
made
an
election
when
it--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
had
no
choice
in
the
transaction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
election
refers
to
when
you
are
filling
out
your
tax
returns
at
the
end
of
next
year.
you
have
a
choice.
you
can
take
this
as
gross
income
or,
in
filling
out
your
returns
you
can
elect--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--elect
to
reduce
the
basis
of
depreciated
property
that
you
have.
and
that
also...
that
points
out--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
points
out
a
further
incongruity
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
when
centennial
and
other
s&l's
are
paying
interest
on
the
cd's
that
are
held,
they
get
a
current
deduction
from
income
for
the
interest
that
is
credited.
now,
when
they
get
that
interest
back
because
of
an
early
withdrawal
penalty,
they
want
to
spread
the
income
out
over
time.
it
seems
more
natural
to
treat
the
two
sides
of
the
transaction
the
same
way.
they're
getting
a
current
deduction
for
the
interest
payment,
they
ought
to
take
the
current
income
they
get
from
the
penalties
in
at
that
time
rather
than
spread
it
out
over
time.
now,
the
situation
in
reality
is
no
different
than,
and
the
regulations
don't
prohibit
this,
that
if
the
depositor
wanted
to
say
here's
my
check
for
the
penalty,
give
me
all
my
money
back,
that
would
have
to
be
permitted
under
the
federal
regulations.
when
you
just
say
give
me
back
all
my
money
less
the
amount
of
the
penalty,
it's
clear
that
all
you're
doing
there
is
using
the
offset
as
a
method
of
payment.
the
depositor
is
not
forgiving
any
obligation
that
the
s&l
has.
as
i
started
to
point
out
earlier,
the
commissioner--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
has
to
be
the
reason,
as
the
statute
says,
and
the
reason
means
the
source.
why
do
you
have
that
income?
is
it
from
discharge
of
indebtedness?
is
it
because
i,
the
depositor,
say
for
reasons
of
my
own
i'd
like
my
money
back
now?
no.
that's
not
how
it
works.
the
reason
is
because
of
the
penalty
mandated
by
federal
law.
why
am
i...
why
am
i
letting
you
take...
to
deduct
that
from
my
savings,
or
why
am
i
giving
you
a
check
for
that
amount?
because
i
have
an
obligation
to
do
that
in
the
event
of
an
early
withdrawal,
not
because...
and
that
obligation
applies
whether
you
and
i
like
it
or
not.
it's
not
like
the
earlier
situation
we
discussed,
where
we
sit
down
and
say,
you
know,
let's
call
it
quits
for
$800.
it's
a
very
different
sort
of
transaction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
not
be
income
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness.
it
would
be
establishing
a
separate
obligation
between
ourselves
prior
to
the
transaction.
and
at
the
time,
if
i
said
i'd
like
my
money
back
early,
i
would
have
triggered
my
obligation
to
pay
you
the
penalty,
the
liquidated
damages
in
that
case,
that
we
agreed
upon.
we
would
not
be
entering
into
a
negotiation
to
forgive
some
of
the
debt.
there
would
be
two
obligations
between
us.
yours
to
give
me
the
money
back,
mine
to
pay
you
what
we
agreed
upon
in
the
event
of
an
early
withdrawal.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
the
same
deal.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
are
separate
obligations
that
are
being
discharged.
now,
if
we
don't
have
any
agreement
ahead
of
time
and
i
just
come
to
you
and
say
i'd
like
the
money
early,
can
we
talk
about
it,
there's
still
only
one
obligation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well...
but
the
agreement
will
be
your
forgiving
me
part
of
the
debt
that
i
owe
you.
in
the
other
example
it's
just
setting
an
obligation,
a
separate
obligation.
when
we
come
down
the
line
and
that
condition
is
triggered,
we're
not
forgiving
the
debt.
we're
paying,
as
the
seventh
circuit
put
it
in
the
colonial
savings
case,
liquidated
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
if
it
had
been
set
in
advance
it
would
still
set
up
a
system
of
two
different
obligations.
and
the
question
under
the
statute,
what's
the
reason
for
the
income
that
you...
that
you
receive,
and
you
would
say
the
reason
is
that
we
had
this
deal
and
you
are
obligated
to
pay
me
that
on
early
withdrawal.
you
wouldn't
say
the
reason
is
that
you
have
decided
to
forgive
me
some
of
what
i
owe
you.
now,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
set
forth
his
understanding
of
these
transactions
in
a
revenue
ruling.
he
said
there
are
two
separate
transactions:
the
payment
of
the
interest
and
the
payment
of
the
penalty.
the
fact
that
the
s&l's
typically
just
netted
out
when...
in
the
event
of
early
withdrawal,
doesn't
obscure
that
fact.
congress
knew
about
that
revenue
ruling.
it
modified
the
internal
revenue
code
to
take
account
of
it,
adding
a
provision
that
let
depositors
who
didn't
itemize
their
deductions
take
a
deduction
in
the
case
of
the
penalty
that
they
incurred.
but
it
didn't
alter
the
commissioner's
understanding
of
how
the
transaction
took
place.
two
separate
transactions.
separate
transactions
because
they
involve
separate
obligations.
since
they
are
separate
obligations,
the
income
is
not
income
from
the
forgiveness
of
debt.
it
is
income
used
to
pay
the
other
obligation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
even
sure
that
in
that...
yes,
i
think
so.
and
in
that
case
i'm
not
sure
that
you
could
say
that
there
was
any
debt
at
all.
if
i
came
back
at
the
end
of
20
days,
i
say
our
deal
was
set
for
20
days--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
there's
no
forgiveness
of
the
debt
if
i
come
in
3
days
later
and
i
say
our
deal
for
3
days
was
that
you
would
give
me
this
much
back,
and
that
what
i
would
like.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
two
separate
obligation
notion
is
of
course
stronger
in
this
case
because
it's
set
forth
in
the
federal
regulations
and
in
the...
in
the
opinions.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
your...
in
your
case
i
don't
understand
that
there's...
it's
as
if
there
are,
for
30
days,
30
different
deals.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
saying
that
in
your
case
i
don't
see
that
there
is
an
ongoing,
an
entire
ongoing
obligation.
you
wouldn't
be--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
example,
if
you
decide
to
withdraw
it
after
3
days
you
couldn't
be
said
to
be
forgiving
the
obligation
for
the
next
27
days.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
different
in
that
there
are,
as
i
would
say,
30
different
deals
in
your
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
but
the
obligation
going
the
other
way
is
not
one
to
pay
back
at
set
days.
it
is
simply
to
pay
back
at
the
end
of
the...
at
the
end
of
the
term.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
the
case
where
the
penalty
is
set
in
advance,
it's
easier
in
that
situation
to
see
why...
why
are
you
getting
the
money.
you're
getting
the
money
because
of
the
obligation
i
have
to
pay
the
penalty
set
by
the
federal
law
and
our
agreement.
and
that
separate
obligation
means
that
the
income
you
receive
is
not
income
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness.
it's
income
because
of
the
obligation
that
i
have.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
envision
a
situation
where,
if
it's
all
set
in
advance,
that
that's
not
also
a
separate
obligation.
if
it's
something--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
novation
would
be
the
negotiation
to
forgive
some
of
the
debt,
only
one
obligation,
the
debtor's,
forgive
some
of
that.
and
that
would
result
in
income
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness.
in
the
other
situation
there
is
a
separate
obligation,
and
that's
the
source
of
the
income.
on
this
issue
the
seventh
circuit
in
colonial
savings
we
think
got
it
right
in
recognizing
that
the
situation
is
no
different
from
the
depositor
writing
a
check
for
the
penalty
and
getting
the
full
amount
back.
the
fact
that
they
chose
the
offset
as
the
method
of
payment
shouldn't
lead
to
a
different
tax
result.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
very
brief,
your
honor.
on
the
mortgage
swap
issue,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
what
the
taxpayer
is
trying
to
accomplish
here.
he
is
trying
to
have
his
cake
and
eat
it
too.
he
structured
a
transaction
to
ensure
that
the
pools
of
mortgages
that
were
swapped
would
be
substantially
identical.
because
they
were,
because
they
did
not
change
his
economic
position,
the
taxpayer
showed
no
loss
to
the
bank
board.
they
said
our
position
hasn't
changed,
everything
is
the
same,
and
then
turned
around
and,
industrywide,
claimed
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
tax
losses.
as
one
of
the
district
judges
noted,
it
is
almost
ludicrous
to
maintain,
as
the
taxpayer
does
and
must,
that
something
can
at
the
same
time
be
substantially
identical
and
materially
different.
their
position
rests
on
that
inherent
contradiction,
and
i
would
respectfully
urge
the
court
not
to
embrace
that
position.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
certainly
suffered
the
losses.
they
did
not
realize
the
losses
as
a
result
of
these
swap
of
substantially
identical
pools.
on
the
section
108
issue
i
will
take
one
more
run
at
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
there
is
no
income
from
discharge
of
indebtedness,
forgiveness
of
indebtedness
in
that
case,
because
there
is
no
forgiveness
of
any
obligation
at
all,
either
to
forgive
the
indebtedness
or
as
a
method
of
offset.
the
debt
obligation
is
simply
being
satisfied
according
to
its
90
or
30
different
terms.
the
columbia
gas
case,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
there
was
income
at
all.
it
wasn't
litigated
as
an
issue
of
whether
it
should
be
income
from
discharge
of
indebtedness
or
regular
income.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
