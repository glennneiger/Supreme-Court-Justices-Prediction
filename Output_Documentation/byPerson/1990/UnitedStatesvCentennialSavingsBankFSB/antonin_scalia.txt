justice
scalia
how
do
you
feel
about
this
one,
mr.
roberts?
justice
scalia
you're
sure
there's
not
a
material
difference
between
the
two?
justice
scalia
um-hum.
suppose
i
say,
when
you
come
to
me
with
that
proposition,
can
i
pay
it
off...
well,
let's
see.
you
want
to
pay
it
off...
no,
i
want
you
to
pay
it
off
early.
and
you
say
to
me
okay,
i'll
pay
it
off
early,
but
you'll
have
to
pay
a
penalty
of
$200.
suppose
it's
put
that
way.
would
that
make
the
difference
whether
you
call
it
a
penalty
or
put
it
in
another
way?
justice
scalia
um-hum.
justice
scalia
would
you
describe
for
me...
you
say
"but
for"
is
not
enough
causation
to
say
that
it's
a...
it's
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
the
indebtedness.
what
must
it
be
beyond
"but
for"?
the
motivation
for
the
payment
must
be
to--
justice
scalia
--what
if
it
isn't
a
federal
regulation?
what
if
we
just
agree
at
the
time
we
make
the
loan,
you
and
i,
that
if
you
discharge
it
early
you'll
have
to
pay
a
premium?
then
that
would
not
be--
justice
scalia
--why
does
that
make
any
sense?
it's
the
same
deal,
whether
we
negotiate
it
before...
before
i
come
asking
for
prepayment
or
afterwards.
it's
exactly
the
same
deal.
what
sense
does
it
make
to
say
if
you
negotiate
it
beforehand
it
can't
qualify
for
this
treatment,
but
if
you
negotiate
it
at
the
time
it
can?
justice
scalia
well,
there's
one
obligation
until
we
make
an
agreement.
at
some
point
before
the
money
is
paid
over
you're
going
to
say
okay,
yes,
you
can
prepay,
but,
and
at
that
point
there'll
be
an
agreement.
instead
of
having
been
made
2
years
ago,
it'll
be
made
a
minute
before
the
money
changes
hands.
but
there
will
be
an
agreement.
justice
scalia
mr.
duhl,
you
would...
this
is
the
moment
of
truth.
you
would
say
that
exchanging
one
bushel
of
wheat
for
another
bushel
of
wheat
would
quality?
justice
scalia
no,
it
would
be
materially--
justice
scalia
--would
or
would
not?
that
would
not
be
materially
different?
justice
scalia
it's
different
wheat,
in
two
different
bushels.
justice
scalia
all
you
know
is
it's
two
different
bushels
of
wheat.
one
bushel
may
have
worms
in
it,
the
other
one
may
not.
i
don't
know
what
consequences
there
are.
justice
scalia
but
chances
are
there
is
no
difference,
but
i
can't
say
for
sure,
just
as
with
these
mortgages.
justice
scalia
what
i
know
for
sure
is
it's
not
the
same
bushel
of
wheat,
which
you
couldn't
say
in
these
cases.
it's
the
same
assets,
the
same
rights,
it's...
it
has
a
different
name.
this
is
not
a
bushel
that
has
just
a
different
name,
the
way
that
two
different
corporations
in
the
same
state
with
the
same
assets,
just
a
different
name.
these
are
different
bushels
of
wheat.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
what
does
fungible
mean
except
that
the
market
treats
them
as
the
same?
they
are
really
different
wheat,
but
the
market
doesn't
care.
i
thought
that's
the
very
definition
of
fungible?
justice
scalia
and
if
you
buy
that,
you've
bought,
you've
bought
the
government's
theory.
justice
scalia
i...
suppose
you
trade...
you
trade
wheat
in
one
warehouse
for
wheat
in
another
warehouse,
and
one,
and
the
warehouse
you've
traded
burns
down.
it
would've
made
a
big
difference.
justice
scalia
so,
i
guess
what
you
say
is
it
depends
on
whether
you're
trading
wheat
in
baskets
or
in
warehouses?
is
that
the
difference?
justice
scalia
mr.
duhl,
i'm
concerned
about
the
hypothetical
that
justice
stevens
gave
to
mr.
roberts
about
a
debt
agreement
in
which
you
pay
less
and
less
depending
upon
how
soon
you
pay
it
off.
it...
is
every
time
you
pay
it
off
voluntarily
earlier,
is
the
difference
between
that
price
and
what
you
would
have
had
to
pay
if
you
waited
longer,
is
that
always
income
by
reason
of
discharge
of
indebtedness?
justice
scalia
could...
isn't
it
possible
that
discharge
of
indebtedness
means
only
permitting
you
to
pay
it
off
before
it...
before
you're
entitled
to...
before
you're
entitled
to?
i
mean,
normally
when
a
debt
matures
and
you
pay
it,
you
don't
say
you're
discharging
the
debt.
discharging
the
debt
means
interrupting
the
whole
process
of
the
loan,
doing
it
prematurely.
justice
scalia
in
which
case
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
wouldn't
qualify
as
a
discharge
of
an
indebtedness.
justice
scalia
well,
but
it's
not
an
earlier
discharge
if
you
have
an
absolute
right
at
any
point
to
pay
it
off.
i
mean,
couldn't
it
have
been
directed
to
the
classic
situation
where
you
say
i
know
that...
i
know
that
technically
this
money
is
out
for
longer.
you
don't
have
to
pay
it
back
to
me
yet,
but
gee,
i
would
really
like
to
have
it
back.
and
i'll
tell...
you
have
no
obligation
to.
justice
scalia
whereas
the
bank
here
had
an
obligation
to
turn
the
money
over.
justice
scalia
if
the
depositor
came
in
and
said
i
want
it
now,
the
bank
had
to
give
it
over.
justice
scalia
mr.
duhl,
suppose
i
enter
into
an
agreement
with
somebody,
they
give
me
money
now,
and
in
exchange...
i
have
to
pay
back
$10,000
after
10
years.
but
it's
agreed
that
if
i
pay
back
within
9
years
it's
only
$9,000,
8
years
$8,000,
7
years
$7,000,
and
so
forth.
now
suppose
7
years
go
by
and
i
pay
the
$7,000.
have
i
acquired
$3,000
income
by
reason
of
discharge
of
an
indebtedness?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
it...
that's
just
the
deal
between
us.
they
gave
me
$3,000
to
begin
with,
and
i
said
i
would
pay
back
$10,000
after
10
years.
but
9
after
9
years,
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
of
course,
isn't
it
also
somewhat
ludicrous
to
assume
the
savings
and
loan
industry
didn't
suffer
all
these
losses?
