we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1926,
united
states
v.
centennial
savings
bank.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
analysis
if
the
penalty
had
not
been
required
by
federal
regulation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
duhl,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
was
the
regulation
promulgated,
mr.
duhl?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
are
the
dates
of
the
weiss
and
marr
decisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
is
it
your
view
that
the
predecessor
of
the
present
regulation
was
based
on
weiss
and
marr?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
was
then...
the
regulation...
the
predecessor
was
promulgated
after
those
two
decisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yet
the
purpose
of
r-59...
49,
mr.
duhl,
was
to
enable
the
savings
and
loans
to
generate
income
by
taking
a
tax
loss
without
really
altering
their
fundamental
economic
position,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
wasn't
the
idea
behind
r-49
that
this
change
really
was
not
going
to
change
anybody's
net
worth?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
duhl,
if
there
are,
you
know,
plausible,
reasonable
arguments
on
both
sides
of
this
question,
don't
we
customarily
defer
to
a
revenue
ruling
by
the
commissioner,
which
i
understand
there
is
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no
deference
whatever,
or
simply
less
deference
than
to
regulations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
was
this
revenue
ruling
adopted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
duhl.
mr.
roberts,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
