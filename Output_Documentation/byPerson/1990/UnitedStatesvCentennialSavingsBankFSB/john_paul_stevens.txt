justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
can
i
just
ask
you
a
question
there?
as
i
read
the
instruments
in
the
appendix,
the
depositor
never
gets
less
than
the
principal
back.
what
is
described
as
a
penalty
actually
is
a
failure
to
receive
some
of
the
interest
that
would
otherwise
have
been
earned.
am
i
correct
on
that?
justice
stevens
that's
not
what...
do
any
of
the
instruments
in
the
record
say
that?
they
all
say
you
would
not
get
the
interest
that
would
otherwise
have
been
earned
during
the
period.
this
is
in
a
less
than
90-day
period.
that's
the
phrasing
of
each
of
these
instruments.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
right,
but
you
still
get
your
principal
back.
you
still
get
your
principal...
i
don't
think
there
are
any
of
these
certificates--
justice
stevens
--you
get
less
than
the
principal.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
you'd
get...
but
you'd
forfeit
then
the
interest
that
would
have
been
earned
during
the
period
that
you
held
the
certificate.
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
read
it
that
way.
but
you're
telling
me
that's
the
way
these
instruments
should
be
read?
justice
stevens
where
is
that
regulation
in
the
record?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question?
supposing,
just
to...
testing
the
importance
of
whether
there
are
two
separate
obligations
or
only
one,
supposing
you
had
one
separate
document
that
in
substance
says
i
hereby
loan
you
$10,000
as
a
certificate
of
deposit
on
the
understanding
that
you
will
repay
at
the
end
of
90
days
$10,250,
whatever
the
interest
rate
might
be.
or
if
you
repay,
and
then
it
has
a
schedule
of
89
different
entries
on
it,
and
a
slightly
different
dollar
value
at
each
one
of
those
dates,
depending
on
how
much
interest,
you
know,
you
balance
the
thing
out.
so
there
is
one
document
describing
one
obligation
that
can
be
discharged
in
90
different
ways.
would
then
the...
and
you
don't
describe
anything
as
a
penalty.
would
that
be
a
different
case
than
this?
justice
stevens
well,
there's
a
debt.
you
deposit
the
$10,000
just
like
a
bank
deposit.
you
just
fill
out
the
payment
obligation
for
each
possible
day
on
which
payment
might
be
made.
it's
clearly--
justice
stevens
--yes.
it
tells
you
just
how
much
you
get
back
on
each
day
that
it
might
be
paid
off.
economically
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
what
you
have
got
here,
but
you
don't
use
the
term
penalty.
you
just
have
a
schedule
so
people
can
figure
it
out
in
advance,
what,
how
much
it
would
cost
to
with...
for
an
early
withdrawal.
justice
stevens
and
i
say
it's
all
in
one
document,
so
you
don't
worry
about
whether
it's
two
separate
obligations
or
not.
i'm
not
sure
that's
not
a
stronger
case
for
you,
frankly,
but
i
just...
i'm
just
wondering
whether
you
really
need
to
rely
on
this
two
separate
obligation
notion.
justice
stevens
it
describes
it
as
a
penalty,
but
it
describes
economically
the
same
thing
i
have
described
to
you
in
one
document.
justice
stevens
well,
they
might
be,
some
of
these
you
forfeit
the
interest
accrued
up
to
the
date.
you
could
do
these
in
a
way
that
would
have
a
smaller
penalty
if
you
withdrew
on
the
89th
day
than
if
you
withdrew
on
the
second
day.
justice
stevens
sure
there
is.
justice
stevens
no,
because
it's
all
one
obligation.
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
what...
what
the
regulations
describe.
justice
stevens
well,
there
are
under
the
regulations,
too.
the
penalty
differs
depending
on...
as
i
understand
it,
the
penalty
differs
depending
on
which
day
you
withdraw
it.
the
longer
you
keep
the
money
in,
the
less...
the
more
interest
you
receive.
justice
stevens
well,
subject
to
the
right
to
withdraw
upon
payment
of
a
penalty,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
an
obligation
to
pay
back
a
little
less
if
they
withdraw
earlier.
well,
you
don't
think
it's
the
same?
justice
stevens
well,
you
don't
content
that
fungible
goods
are
materially
different,
do
you?
justice
stevens
almost
by
definition,
if
they're
fungible.
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
can
also
view
it
as
an
agreement
pursuant
to
which
there
are...
during
a
90-day
cd
for
example...
there
are
90
alternative
ways
of
discharging
that
indebtedness.
and
you
just
elected
alternative
february
16
rather
than
the
other.
and
then
there
has
been
no
premature
discharge
of
that
particular
method
of
satisfying
the
debt.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
in
the
agreement
made
at
the
outset
it
was
clear
that
the...
that
he
could
do
that
and
the
bank
would
have
to
comply
with
his
request.
there
was
no
post-contract
formation,
renegotiation
of
a
debt.
justice
stevens
are
there
any
cases
other
than
in
this
particular
area
where
this
provision
has
been
applied
to
a
situation
in
which
the
parties
in
advance
had
agreed
on
the
different
ways
in
which
the
debt
could
be
discharged?
justice
stevens
if
you're
through,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
columbia
gas?
justice
stevens
i
noticed
from
your
footnote
in
your
brief
that
the
second
circuit
adopted
the
irs
position
in
that
case.
so
was
the
taxpayer
arguing
that
it
was
not...
not
income
at
all?
is
that
what
they
were
doing?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
see.
