mr.
michael
f.
duhl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
know
you've
heard
a
lot
about
the
mortgage
exchange
issue,
but
i
would
like
to
make
four
short
points,
if
i
could,
because
we
take
a
somewhat
different
position
from
cottage,
and
it
will
be
addressed
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
in
that
earlier
argument.
first,
we
believe
the
"materially
different"
phrase
in
the
regulation
should
be
interpreted
in
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
those
very
same
words
were
used
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases
in
the
early
1920's
to
try
and
distinguish
a
very
narrow
class
of
situations
in
which
the
properties
exchanged
were
so
identical
that
income
could
not
be
said
to
have
been
realized
in
the
constitutional
sense.
that's
really
what
that
phrase
is
aimed
at.
secondly,
the
weiss
v.
stearn
case
and
marr
v.
the
united
states
shows
how
narrow
that
class
of
exchanges
is.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
we...
exactly
how
we
interpret
this
regulation.
that
the
court
has
said
in
other
cases
that
61
stretches
to
the
entire
power
of
congress'
power
to
tax,
and
in
those
earlier
cases
all
the
court
was
doing
was
defining
out
that
very
narrow
category
that
doesn't
cross
over
that
threshold.
and
if
you
look
at
the
weiss
case
and
the
marr
case--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--i'm
not...
i
think
if
you
were
to
apply
those
cases,
yes.
in
the
last
50
years
the
constitutional
thinking
about
taxation
has
changed
dramatically.
in
the
horse
case
the
court
said
that
realization
is
really
a
principle
of
convenience.
and
in
fact
there
is
now
a
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
purports
to
tax
unrealized
appreciation
in
certain
foreign
currency
exchange
transactions
and
certain
regulated
investment
contracts.
it
isn't
whether
or
not
it
could
be
taxed
or
not.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
these
words
were
used
at
an
earlier
time
to
define
a
very
narrow
class.
the
regulation
comes
in
at
that
time,
uses
the
same
words,
and
defines
a
very
narrow
category.
in
weiss
and
in
marr
the
very
same
thing
happened.
one
corporation
transferred
all
of
its
assets
to
a
newly
formed
corporation.
the
shareholders
of
the
old
corporation
received
stock
in
the
new
corporation
in
exchange
for
their
stock
in
the
old
corporation.
in
both
cases.
in
the
weiss
case
the
stockholder
also
got
some
cash,
but
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
taxability
of
that.
in
both
cases
the
government
argued
that
the
exchange
of
shares
in
the
new
corporation
for
shares
in
the
old
corporation
causes
gain
to
be
realized
in
that
case.
and
in
weiss
the
court
said
well,
because
the
new
corporation
was...
was
incorporated
in
the
very
same
state,
and
therefore
presumably
had
the
same
rights
and
powers
as
the
old
corporation,
the
shares
really
represented
the
same
property
interests
that
the
old
corporation
shares
did.
there
wasn't
in
effect
any
potential
for
different
consequences
to
flow
strictly
from
the
fact
that
you
had
two
different
shells.
in
marr,
on
the
other
hand,
the
new
corporation
was
organized
in
a
different
state,
and
justice
brandeis
noted
that
the
different
noted
that
the
different
state,
it
therefore
had
different
rights
and
powers
under
the
new
state's
law,
and
therefore
it
was
materially
different.
he
didn't
ask
whether
the
shareholders
knew
what
those
rights
and
powers
were,
whether
the
market
knew.
the
fact
is
the
shares
of
stock
were
still
valued
at
the
same
price
on
the
market,
so
that
although
there
may
be
different
risks
involved,
the
market
can't
perceive
what
the
difference
is
at
that
time,
but
it's
the
potential
for
significant
different
consequences
that
makes
the
difference.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
the
regulation
was
promulgated
in
1935,
but
there
was
an
earlier
regulation
that
was
in
existence
prior
to
1924
that
used
the
same
phrase,
it
used
"essentially
different"
instead
of
"materially
different".
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
weiss
and
marr
were...
weiss
came
down
in
1924.
marr
was
decided
in
1925,
but
both
under
the
old
statute.
the
statute
was
changed
significantly
in
1924.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
i
don't
know
when
the
predecessor
regulation
was
promulgated.
to
be
based
on,
it
must
have
been...
it
must
have
been,
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
would
not
be
materially
different.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
no--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--my...
i
don't
think
you
know
enough
when
you
ask
is
one
bushel
of
wheat
the
same
as
another
bushel
of
wheat.
you
have
to--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--but
to
the
extent
that
there
are
no
different
consequences
that
can
flow
from
one
bushel
or
the
other,
i
would
suggest
that's
what
the
not
materially
different
phrase
is
for.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
well,
and
i
think
what--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--well,
i
believe
you
have
to
look
at
what
you
have.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
then
they
would
be
materially
different,
your
honor.
but
i
point
out
to
you
there
is
also
a
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
section
1031,
which
says
you
don't
recognize
gain
or
loss
on
the
exchange
of
like
kind
properties.
and
surely
the
two
bushels
of
wheat
are
like
kind
properties.
and
so
congress
has
answered
that
question.
i
mean,
it
becomes
a
theoretical
question
that
is
unnecessary
to
answer.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
i
believe
that's
what
the
materially
different
phrase
was
designed
to
do.
it's
designed
to
say
fungible
goods
may
be
different,
but
if
they're
fungible
then
they're
not...
it's
not
material.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
that's
correct.
in
our
case...
the
legislative
history--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--well--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
fungibility
in
that
sense,
because
the
market
makes
everything
fungible
in
terms
of
dollars
and
value.
that
is
presumably
in
the
marketplace
anything
that
sells
for
$25
is
fungible
with
anything
else
that
sells
for
$25.
fungibility
to
me,
as
i
understand
the
term
"fungibility",
has
always
been
two
of
the
exact
same
kind
of
article.
but
all
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
term
"materially
different"
is
really
aimed
at,
just
as
at
the
shares
of
stock
in
the
weiss
case.
they're
different
shares,
because
they're
two
different
corporations,
different
serial
numbers.
they
are
different.
but
they're
not
materially
different
because
nothing
potentially
can
flow
from
them.
they
represent
the
same
property
interest.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1924
statute,
the
very
structure
of
the
code
itself
and
the
sections
of
the
code
we
point
out,
all
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
that
all
exchanges,
almost
all
exchanges,
be
taxable.
that's
why
in
this
case,
in
all
these
mortgage
exchange
cases,
all
the
9
court
of
appeals
judges
and
all
of
the
16
tax
court
judges
that
considered
the
issue
held
that
loss
was
realized.
the
question...
they
then
went
on
to
ask
whether
there
was
a
non-recognition
provision.
the
government's
argument
here
is
really
created
in
this
case.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
it
has
taken
over
the
last
50
years.
it
was
created
to
try
to
deal
with
this
situation,
because
of
r-49.
we
think
r-49
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
tax
consequences
of
the
transaction
and
that
it
should
not
be
adopted.
it
is
simply
inconsistent
with
all
of
this
history.
finally,
finally
i
do
think
the
prior
discussion
about
mutual
funds,
about
stocks,
about
bonds,
demonstrates
that
it's
difficult
to
reconcile
the
government's
position
about
this,
and
i
think
the
easiest
example
to
see
that
in
is
in
the
case
of
triple-a
bonds.
if
i
happen
to
hold
an
investment
in
triple-a
bonds
of
one
company,
and
those
bonds
have
gone
up
substantially
in
value,
and
i
want
to
diversify
my
investment,
under
the
government's
argument
i
think
i
can
call
my
broker
and
say
i
want
you
to
exchange
my
bonds
for
other
triple-a
bonds,
having
the
same
interest
rates,
the
same
maturities,
the
same
payment
schedules.
i
don't
care
who
the
issuers
are,
so
long
as
they
are
triple-a.
and
i
can
say
to
myself
i
haven't
realized
any
income
because
i
don't
care
who
the
other
issuers
are.
it
has
all
the
same
characteristics,
the
same
market
value,
and
i
therefore
don't
report
anything.
and
the
government,
the
irs
never
knows
whether
i
have
engaged
in
that
transaction
or
not,
because
i
don't
tell
them.
i
don't
have
to
tell
them.
more
aggressive
taxpayers,
i
think,
can
use
that
kind
of
analysis
to
deal
with
stocks.
it
seems
to
me
the
government
never
really
comes
to
grips
with
the
concept
of
material
difference
and
how
its
effect
on
value
in
the
marketplace.
that
is
the
marketplace
only
looks
at
things
in
terms
of
valuation.
and
its
risk
analysis
is
only
in
terms
of
what
is
the
potential
consequence
that
can
happen.
but
all
of
that
is
a
foresight
look.
and
in
our
case,
in
our
case...
in
every
exchange
case
you
know
the
obligors
are
different.
you
know
the
collateral
is
different.
and
therefore
you
know
that
different
consequences
can
result.
you
don't
know
what
they
may...
what
they
will
be.
you
don't
know
whether
they
will
occur.
but
if
i
hold
a
mortgage
of
john
doe
and
i
hold
a
mortgage
of
tom
roe,
they
may...
because
john
doe
defaults
doesn't
mean
that
tom
roe
is
going
to
default.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
fundamental
economic
position,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is,
they
clearly
have
modified
their
economic
position
in
the
sense
that
their
financial
fortune
was
tied
in
with
the
loans
they
had
originally,
and
their
financial
fortune
is
now
keyed
into
the
new
ones.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
that's
correct,
because
nothing
changes
net
worth
so
long
as
you
get
equivalent
value.
and
the
concept
was,
well,
they
wouldn't
be
changing
their
risk
because
it's...
the
possibility
that
tom
roe
will
default
may
be
equal
to
the
possibility
that
john
doe
will
default.
but
if
i
hold
tom
roe's
and
he
defaults,
and
i
used
to
hold
john
doe's,
that's
materially
different
to
me.
i
have
now
lost.
and
if
i
had
kept
what
i
had
i
wouldn't
have
lost,
whereas
at
the
time
the
market
says
they're
both
worth
the
same
amount.
the
market
can't
tell
that
tom
is
going
to
default
and
john
is
not.
that's
the
key
to
the
entire
concept
of
substance
in
the
tax
law.
my
fortune
is
tied
into
this
piece
of
property
or
it's
tied
into
this
piece
of
property.
and
here
everybody
knew,
in
fact
the
tax
court
in
the
fannie
mae
case
said
it
was
common
sense
that
the
difference
in
mortgages,
the
difference
in
obligors,
the
difference
in
collateral,
would
cause
a
difference
in
economic
consequence
to
occur.
that's
all
that--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--it
makes
a
big
difference.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
well,
that's...
one
of
the
questions
i
would
have
asked
is
what's
the
location
of
the
wheat?
are
they
sitting
right
next
to
each
other
or
are
they...
is
one
in
california
and
one
in
new
york?
if
they
are,
i
think
that...
that's
materially
different.
that
is,
the
"materially
different"
phrase
really
was
coined
in
the
context
of
the
constitutional
issue.
that
issue
was
simply...
has
subsided
over
the
years,
but
the
phrase
has
stayed.
and
it
is...
it
is
necessary,
i
think,
to
have
a
concept
like
that
where
there
are
very
minor
changes,
for
example
in
a
bond
term,
or
some
other
very
minor
modification
that
gives
the
flexibility
to
say,
well,
it
really
isn't
an
exchange,
it's
the
same
property.
but
in
our
case
it
just
isn't
the
same
property.
in
none
of
these
cases
is
it
the
same
property.
and
it's
no
different
than
what
goes
on
at
the
end
of
the
year,
every
tax
year,
when
taxpayers
who
have
losses
in
certain
investments
sell
them
and
reinvest
in
other
investments
that
are
in
the
same
industry
and
therefore
subject
to
the
same
kinds
of
risks,
but
they're
different
companies.
different
companies
have
different
fortunes,
different
obligors
on
notes
have
different
fortunes.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
that
the
congress
over
the
years
has
created
a
very
complex
set
of
rules
to
deal
with
nonrecognition
in
those
situations
where
either
gain
isn't
appropriately
recognized,
or,
in
the
context
on
the
loss
side
where
they
don't
think
it's
appropriate
that
taxpayers
be
able
to
recognize
that.
there
are
such
rules
in
the
code
now.
they
don't
apply
here.
and
to
create
a
nonstatutory
judicial
rule
creates
and
raises
all
the
problems
that
were
discussed
in
the
cottage
argument
about
what
are
the
facts,
did
it
matter,
did
he
care.
all
of
things
are
things
that
congress
can
set
forth
in
statutory
rules
specific
things
to
deal
with.
and
we
just
don't
have
that
here.
we
don't
have
it
here
for
a
reason.
in
fact,
the
whole
concept
of
exchanges
of
notes
came
up
in
the
section
1031
context
and
congress
decided
they
want
gain
to
be...
or
loss
to
be
recognized
there,
because
they
think
those
things
are
like
money.
so
they
specifically
made
a
judgment.
and
now
here
we're
pulling
back,
and
it's
just--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--in
one
of
the
cases
earlier
on
the
government
argued
not
that
they
were
securities
within
the
meaning
of
1031,
but
that
they
were
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
wash
sale
rule,
1091.
and
the
courts
held
that
they
clearly
were
not,
and
the
government
dropped
the
argument,
i
think.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
but
not
within
the
context
of
1031.
let
me
now
turn
to
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
issue,
and
here
we're
again
talking
about
realization,
but
here
we
all
agree
income
was
realized.
the
question
was,
was
it
realized
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
phrase
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness?
and
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
the
only
reason
the
taxpayer
here
realized
income
was
because
the
depositor
came
in
and
said
he
wanted
to
cancel
the
debt,
he
wanted
the
debt
discharged,
he
wanted
his
money
back.
and
but
for
the
depositor
coming
in
and
seeking
the
discharge,
we
would
not
have
had
income.
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
think
about
the
difference
between
the
two
sides,
and
i
think
why
our
position
is
correct,
is
to
go
back
to
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
were
discussed,
including
the
hypotheticals
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
that
he
brought
forth
this
morning.
that
is,
earlier
on
it
was
agreed
that
if
the
depositor...
if
there
is
no
regulation,
if
there
is
no
provision
in
the
cd
agreement,
and
the
depositor
simply
walks
into
the
bank
and
says
i
would
like
to
deposit
my
$100,000
for
2
years
in
a
certificate
of
deposit.
the
bank
takes
the
money,
opens
the
account,
the
depositor
walks
away.
and
then
a
year
later
the
depositor
comes
back
and
says
i
know
my
cd
is
for
2
years,
but
i
would
like
to
have
my
money
back,
and
the
bank
says,
well,
i
don't
have
to
give
it
back
to
you,
but
i
will
if
you
agree
to
accept
$95,000.
and
the
depositor
agrees
and
the
bank
gives
him
the
$95,000.
there
is
discharge
of
indebtedness
income,
income
realized
by
reason
of
the
discharge.
it
should
not
matter
whether
the
bank
says
to
the
depositor
at
that
time,
well,
i
don't
have
to
give
it
back
to
you.
i
will
give...
i
will
give
it
back
to
you,
but
you
have
to
pay
me
a
penalty
of
$5,000--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--well
i...
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
normally
deference
isn't
given
to
revenue
rulings
the
way
it
is
to
regulations.
that
is,
revenue
rulings
are
simply
litigating
positions--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--well,
there
is
definitely...
the
court
has
said,
last
term
in
the
davis
case,
said
the
court
gives
deference
to
a
revenue
ruling
when
it
is
longstanding
and
when
it
is
contemporaneously
adopted.
that's
not
the
case
here,
first
of
all.
second
of
all,
the--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--1973.
and
we're
talking
about
a
change
in
the
statute
that
goes
back
to
1942
with
respect
to
solvent
taxpayers.
and
secondly,
the
revenue
ruling
doesn't
deal
with
our
situation.
the
revenue
ruling
simply
says
that
a
depositor
who
incurs
such
a
forfeiture
or
a
penalty
must
separately
deduct
that
charge,
as
opposed
to
not
reporting
interest
income.
and
the
reason
it
says
that
is
because
interest
income
is
accrued
as
it
is
credited
to
a
depositor's
account.
so
that
if
the
bank
credits
interest
quarterly,
under
these
cd
arrangements
the
depositor
is
entitled
to
withdraw
the
interest.
so
all
the
ruling
is
saying
is
once
it's
in
his
account
and
he
can
withdraw
it,
it's
no
different
than
his
principal.
it's
as
if
he
took
the
money
out
and
redeposited
it.
and
so
therefore,
they
say,
once
it's
income
to
you,
you
can't
retroactively
go
back
and
say
it's
not
income
because
you
forfeited.
they
say
you
treat
it
as
a
separate...
as
a
separate
deduction.
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
however,
of
whether
that
separate
deduction
is
income
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
to
the
bank.
it's
simply
dealing
with
the
depositor's
side.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
in
fact
the
agreement
is
that
there
is
a
schedule
that
says
if
it
is
paid
back
in
1
year
you
would
pay
x,
if
2
years
you
pay
y,
and
y
is
greater,
that
that
is
the
essence
of
discharge
of
indebtedness,
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
i
can
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--well,
i
would
look
at
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
as
the
last
date
being
the
maturity
date,
and
any
period
point
in
between
is
an
early
discharge.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
question
of
how
one
looks
at
it.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
let
me--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--perhaps--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
that...
that's
true
only
in
the
sense
that
the
bank
agrees
that
it
will
give
it
back
if
it
doesn't
have
to
give
everything
back.
and
the
parties
here
did
agree
on
a
specific
maturity
date.
and
all
they
did
was
anticipate
in
advance
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
depositor
will
want
his
money
back
early.
so
that
there's
no
disagreement
here
that
this
was
an
early
discharge
on
these
facts.
everyone
agrees
to
that.
and
surely--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--well,
except
that
in
our
case...
in
our
case
the
election
is
made
by
the
creditor,
not
the
debtor.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
bank
says
i
will--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--yes,
your
honor.
the
columbia
gas
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
we
believe
is
exactly
this
case,
in
the
sense
that
in
that
case
a
corporation
issued
certain
bonds
that
were
convertible
into
stock
before
maturity.
and
the
bond
document
specifically
said
that
if
a
bondholder
chooses
to
convert
into
stock
prior
to
maturity,
that
any
interest
that
has
accrued
in
the
meantime,
from
the
last
interest
payment
date
until
the
date
of
conversion,
will
not
be
taken
into
account
in
the
conversion.
that
is,
stock
will
not
be
given
for
that
interest.
so
that
the
bondholder
forfeited
that
interest,
paid
a
penalty
equal
to
that
amount
of
interest.
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
corporation
has
discharged
of
it
and
had
realized
income
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
because
of
that
interest
that
it
was...
that
it
was
released
from,
and
the
court
held
it
was.
and
the
court
of
claims
in
bethlehem
steel
case
also
held
it
was.
in
our
view
the
government
doesn't
say
that
case
is
wrongly
decided,
it
simply
says,
well,
there
was
no
obligation
to
make
a
payment
in
that
case.
and
we
say
that
there
was
just
as
much
an
obligation
to
make
a
payment
in
that
case
as
there
is
in
our
case.
neither
one
of
them...
do
the
documents
talk
about
making
a
payment,
having
an
obligation,
but
in
both
cases
there
is
an
amount
that
gets,
in
advance,
agreed
to
be
forfeited.
the
more
basic
point
really
is
that
the
medium
of
payment
characterization
of
discharge
of
indebtedness
income
to
which
the
government
is
trying
to
push
our
case
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
situations
in
which
the
discharge,
the
penalty,
the
forfeiture,
is
all
integrally
related
to
the
initial
creation
of
the
debt.
it's
very
easy
to
distinguish
those
cases
because
they
deal
with
totally
separate,
independent
obligations.
it's
the
independence
that
draws
that
doctrine
into
play.
it's
not
that
there
is
a
separate
obligation.
so
that
in
the
painting,
house
painting
case,
for
example,
that's
on
page
16
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner,
where
he
suggests,
in
the
context
of
our
facts,
that
we
can
continue
to
think
about
this
example,
if
the
depositor
says
to
the
bank
here
is
my
$100,000,
but
if
you
paint
my
house
you
only
have
to
return
$95,000.
the
government
uses
that
example
to
suggest
our
"but
for"
test
is
incorrect
because
it
says
there
too
the
bank
would
not
have
realized
income
but
for
the
fact
that
it...
that
the
debt
was
discharged,
because
it...
he
says...
the
bank
didn't...
the
depositor
didn't
contract
to
pay
the
bank
to
paint
his
house.
but
surely
he
did
contract
to
pay
the
bank
to
paint
his
house.
that
was
the
deal.
if
you
paint
my
house
you
only
have
to
give
me
back
$95,000.
the
value
of
the
painting
is
$5,000.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
and
interest
is
being
paid
currently,
so
that
extra
$3,000
doesn't
represent
interest
for
keeping
the
debt
out
longer?
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
i
don't
think
that's
discharge
of
indebtedness
income,
your
honor,
because
the
internal
revenue
code
has
other
rules
that
deal
with
such
zero
coupon,
no-interest-bearing
notes,
so
to
speak.
that
is
in
that
case
it's
clear
that
the
time
value
of
money
is
such
that
if
you
give
somebody
$3,000
today,
he's
getting
the
use
of
those
funds,
you're
being
deprived
of
the
use
of
those
funds,
and
you're
entitled
to
interest
in
compensation
for
that.
and
so
the
growing...
the
growing
amount
of
principal
that
has
to
be
repaid,
depending
on
when
it
is
repaid,
is
really
a
substitute
for
interest.
and
i
think
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
internal
revenue
service
would
clearly
treat
it
that
way.
there
are
sections
that
require
it
to
be
treated
that
way.
and
it's
not
discharged
at
all.
here
we
ought
to
ask
what
is
the...
what
is
the
depositor
paying
for?
the
depositor
here
is
paying
to
discharge
the
debt.
he
wants
to
terminate
the
debt.
in
the
house
painting
case
he
wants
his
house
painted,
so
he
is
paying
for
it.
if
you
look
at
the
creditor's
balance
sheet
you
will
always
be
able
to
distinguish
pure
discharge
from...
from
medium
of
payment,
because
in
the
pure
discharge
case
he
starts
with
$100,000
receivable,
he
winds
up
with
$95,000
cash
after
he
withdraws,
and
he
has
a
loss
of
$5,000,
because
there's
nothing
else
there.
in
the
medium
of
payment
case,
in
the
house
painting
case,
he
similarly
starts
with
an
asset
of
$100,000.
that
turns
into
$95,000
of
cash,
but
there
is
another
asset
on
his
balance
sheet
now
that's
worth
$5,000.
that
is
his
house
has
gone
up
by
5.
his
net
worth
in
a
medium
of
payment
case
is
exactly
the
same.
it's
simply
that
the
payment
is
incidental
to
the
debtorcreditor
relationship.
because
it
exists,
because
two
relationships
exist,
they
simply
offset
one
against
each
other.
that's
the
independent
nature
of
a
medium
of
payment
obligation.
in
this
case
all
the
obligations,
as
the
fifth
circuit
held,
are
integrally
related
to
each
other.
they
all
relate
to
the
pure
debtor-creditor
relationship,
and
because
of
that
the
penalty
is
being
paid
to
discharge
the
debt.
and
as
a
result,
it
is...
it
would
not
have
been
realized
but
for
the
discharge,
and
therefore
it
is
realized
by
reason
of
the
discharge.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
no,
the
taxpayer
was
arguing
that
yes,
they
did
not
have
to
report
that
income--
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
--but
they
could
simply
offset
it.
because
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
taxpayer
did
not
make
the
election
that
he
needed
to
make,
and
so
it
didn't
help
him
that
it
was
discharged.
mr.
michael
f.
duhl
thank
you.
