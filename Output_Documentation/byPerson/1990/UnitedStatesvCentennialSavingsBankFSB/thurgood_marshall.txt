justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
case,
united
states
versus
centennial
savings
bank
no.
89-1926,
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
lending
institution
realizes
deductible
losses
when
it
exchanges
mortgage
loan
with
another
lender.
we
also
hold
that
family
withdrawal
from
these
accounts
collected
by
a
savings
account
do
not
qualify
as
income
from
the
discharge
of
in
debt
following
under
section
108
of
the
tax
code.
we
therefore
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
white
joins.
