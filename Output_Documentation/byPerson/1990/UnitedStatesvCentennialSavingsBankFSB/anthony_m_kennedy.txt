so
are
you
saying
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
must
always
be
something
that
is
renegotiated?
justice
kennedy
and
the
distinction
is
between
the
original...
an
original
contract
and
the
novation?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it,
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
income
as
defined
in
section
61
reaches
to
the
full
extent
of
income
under
the
sixteenth
amendment?
justice
kennedy
so
then
what
those
cases
say
is
relevant
here?
justice
kennedy
and
so
you're
saying
that
the
government
couldn't
tax,
under
its
theory
couldn't
tax
this
even
if
it
chose
to
by
a
specific
statutory
provision?
justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
if
the
government
doesn't
like
that
they
can
have
a
wash
sale
statute?
justice
kennedy
on
that
point,
was
there
ever
an
argument
that
these
mortgages
were
securities
within
that
provision?
justice
kennedy
but
not
within
the
context
of
1031?
