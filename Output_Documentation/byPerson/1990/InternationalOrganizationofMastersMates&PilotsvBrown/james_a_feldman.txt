mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
department
of
labor
in
this
case
is
that
section
401(c)
of
the
lmrda
means
what
it
says
when
it
states
that
unions,
quote,
"shall
be
under
a
duty
to
comply
with
all
reasonable
requests
of
any
candidate
to
distribute
by
mail
or
otherwise,
at
the
candidate's
expense,
campaign
literature.
"
one
thing
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
is
something
as
an
aside
to
the
argument
so
far
is
that
that
language
was
in
the
original
version
of
the
lmrda
that
was
reported
out
of
the
senate
committee.
it
was
later
embodied
by
senator
javitz
with
other
language
that
he
added
that
became
the
current
section
401(c).
but
the
particular
language
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
was
from
the
original
bill
that
was
reported
out
of
committee.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
okay,
let
me
take
the
first
question
first.
the
secretary's
view
that
the
focus
of
the
statute,
as
the
statutory
language
indicates,
is
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
request,
is
a
consistent
view
that,
as
the
materials
that
we
have
lodged
with
the
court
show,
dates
back
as
long
as
1960.
now,
it's
true
that
at
that
time
the
particular
issue
of
whether
a
reasonable
rule
can
trump
an
otherwise
reasonable
request
had
not
yet
arisen.
but
when
that
particular
application
of
the
general
principle
arose,
starting
in
the
mid-1980's,
the
secretary
took
the
position,
for
instance
in
the
third
circuit
donovan
against
carpenter's
case,
that
the
issue,
the
ultimate
issue,
the
one
and
only
test
that
section
401(c)
imposes
is
whether
the
rule...
is
whether
the
request
is
reasonable.
and
then
it
indeed
formed
the
basis
of
letters
that
the
secretary
wrote
in
this
case
and
the
briefs
that
we
filed
in
this
court.
now
that
position...
really
the
only
substantial
argument
that
that
is
not
a
clear
position
is
that
there
is
another
regulation,
29
cfr
452.67,
that
says,
quote,
"it
is
advised
that
a
union
inform
all
candidates
in
advance
of
the
conditions
under
which
distribution
will
be
made.
"
first
of
all,
that
doesn't
speak
specifically
of
rules.
and
secondly,
the
purpose
of
having
unions
give
such
advice
to
candidates,
it
can
serve
a
number
of
different
functions
under
the
statute.
for
one
thing,
and
i
think
that's
extremely
important,
it
can
provide
a
safe
harbor
to
everybody
involved
to
know
under
what
circumstances
a
candidate
can
get--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yeah,
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
in
other
words--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
existence
of
the
rule
can
be
helpful
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
first
of
all,
insofar
as
there
are
genuine
administrative
constraints
that
a
union
is
operating
under,
and
if
the
union...
if
the
union
rule
points
attention
to
that...
to
those
constraints,
then
indeed
a
court
will
certainly
take
notice
of
those
constraints
and
will
take
the
rule
into
account
in
judging
whether
a
particular
request
is
reasonable.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
fact
we
are
not
saying...
we
are
saying
all
rules
can
be
considered.
the
question
is
what
exact
way,
and
how
are
they,
do
they
fit
into
the
calculus.
our
answer
to
that
is,
first
of
all
they
can
provide
a
safe
harbor
to
let
people
know
how
they
can
get
requests
granted.
secondly,
they
can
also...
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
prohibits
a
union
from
granting
requests
that
a
court
might
find
were
unreasonable,
so
long
as
it
operates
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
so
unions--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think...
well,
in
each
case
the
question
is
whether
the
request
was
reasonable.
if
the
election
were
being
held
on
july
6--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
question...
i
think
that
first
the
question
is
whether
the...
if
the
election
were
held
on
july
6th,
such
a
rule--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
you're
talking
about
the
election--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
if
there
is
a
genuine
administrative
constraint
that
the
union
is
operating
under--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
answer
is
yes.
let
me...
let
me
try
to
explain
it
this
way.
insofar
as...
the
question
is
whether
the...
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
the
request
is
reasonable.
now,
if
the
union
rule,
for
instance,
serves
a
purpose
of
publicizing
a
administrative
constraint
that
the
union
might
be
operating
under,
and
if
there
is
some
reason
why
the
union...
well,
is
the
question
whether...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
is
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
okay,
but
with
one
exception.
that
the
union,
occasionally
there
may
be
rules
that
by
publicizing
a
certain
constraint
may
make
the
difference
between
the
judgment
of
whether
a
request
is
reasonable
or
not.
for
instance,
we
give
the
example
in
our
brief
of
where
a
union
maintains
its
membership
lists
on
cards,
and
needs
to
take
those
cards
out
to
send
out
the
election
ballots
during
a
certain
period
of
time.
now,
in
the
absence
of
a
rule
it
may
be
perfectly
reasonable,
where
no
one
knows
what
that
time
period
is,
for
a
candidate
to
request
that
a
mailing
be
done
during
that
time,
especially
if
it's
close
to
the
election.
where
the
union
has
a
rule,
publicizes
that
fact,
in
that
case
the
candidate
reasonably
wouldn't
rely
on
getting
his
mailing
done
during
that
period
and
the
request
may
be
unreasonable.
so
the
union
can
serve...
the
rule
can
serve
the
function
of
publicizing
a
condition
that
exists,
and
therefore
affect
the
reasonableness
of
a
request.
but
in
each
case
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
request
is
reasonable,
and
in
each
case,
there
is
no
case...
well,
there
is
no
case
in
which
a
request
which
is
reasonable
is
made
unreasonable
just
by
the
fact
that
a
union
has
adopted
a
rule.
it's,
the
fact
that
it's
publicized
may
make
a
difference.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
am
not
sure...
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
you
have
to
remand,
and
i
guess
i
also
don't
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
to
quite
have
said
that.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
ultimate
question
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
request,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
this
case
that
request
was
reasonable,
no
matter
what
factors
would
have
been
shown
about
the
rule
and
its
application
in
other
cases.
and
therefore
there
is
nothing
left
to
decide
on
a
remand.
and
i
think
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
what
the
district
court
did.
in
fact,
the
district
court,
i
thought,
summarized
the
issue
up
clearly.
it
said,
"although
a
union
certainly
may,
indeed
should,
adopt
a
rule
known
to
all
candidates
in
advance
setting
forth
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
mailings
will
be
made,
in
evaluating
the
validity
of
the
rule
a
union
must
inquire
not
simply
whether
the
rule
may
be
said
to
be
reasonable,
but
whether
its
application
results
in
the
rejection
of
a
reasonable
request.
