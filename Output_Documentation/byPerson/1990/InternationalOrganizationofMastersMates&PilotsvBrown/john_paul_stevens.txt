justice
stevens
mr.
pierson,
you
carefully
leave
out
"or
the
rule
has
the
effect
of
favoring
incumbents.
"
because
i
take
it
in
your
response
to
justice
souter
you
take
the
position
that
any
rule
favors
incumbents.
is
that...
are
you
really
making
that
argument?
i
don't...
it
seems
to
me
if
the
rule
simply
said
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
union
shall
distribute
the
literature
at
the
candidate's
expense
whenever
a
reasonable
request
to
do
so
is
made.
that
wouldn't
favor
incumbents.
justice
stevens
well,
what's
so
hard
about
that?
i
mean,
if
he's
not
a
bona
fide
candidate,
you
don't
distribute
the
literature.
if
it
is,
and
there's
no
particular
problem,
you
distribute
it.
i
don't
see
the
problem.
justice
stevens
sure,
i
say
there
are,
but
you
don't
have
to
distribute
then.
but
you
have
to
decide
whether
the
request
is
reasonable.
the
statute
compels
you
to
do
that.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
point.
it
seemed
to
me
you
were
saying
to
justice
stewart...
justice
souter,
that
any
rule
would
favor
incumbents.
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
them
to...
arguing
that.
i
thought
if
they
say
it's
a
perfectly
neutral
rule,
that
either
incumbents
or
non-incumbents
can
make
reasonable
requests,
and
when
a
reasonable
request
is
made
it
shall
be
granted,
regardless
of
whether
it's
an
incumbent
or
an
insurgent.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
pro-insurgent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
respondent,
a
candidate
for
union
president,
requested
the
union
to
provide
him
with
mailing
labels
so
that
he
could
arrange
for
a
timely
mailing
of
campaign
literature
to
union
members
prior
to
the
union's
nominating
convention.
the
request
was
denied
because
the
union
rule
prohibited
such
pre-convention
mailings.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
court
must
evaluate
the
reasonableness
of
a
union's
rule
before
it
decides
whether
a
candidate's
request
was
reasonable.
respondent
filed
suit
under
section
401(c)
which
requires
every
union
to
comply
with
all
reasonable
request
of
any
candidate
who
wants
to
distribute
campaign
literature
at
his
own
expense.
the
district
court
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
in
respondent's
favor.
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
and
today,
we
also
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
in
our
view,
section
401(c)
prescribes
a
straightforward
test.
is
the
candidate's
distribution
request
reasonable?
the
section's
language
requires
unions
to
comply
with
all
reasonable
requests.
this
literal
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
consistent
with
its
basic
purpose
of
insuring
free
and
democratic
union
elections.
we
reject
the
union's
argument
that
the
request
was
per
se
unreasonable
simply
because
it
conflicts
with
the
union
rule.
the
union
does
not
advance
any
other
reason
for
rejecting
respondent's
request
and
thus,
the
request
must
be
granted.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
