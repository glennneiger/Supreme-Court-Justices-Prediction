chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1330,
the
international
organization
of
masters,
mates
&
pilots
v.
timothy
a.
brown.
mr.
pierson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
pierson,
here
we're
talking
about
a
very
small
fraction
of
what
would
be
covered
by
union
rules.
we're
talking
about
reasonable
request
of
any
candidate
to
distribute
by
mail
or
otherwise,
at
the
candidate's
expense,
campaign
literature.
since
it's
entirely
at
the
candidate's
expense
and
there
is
no
monetary
burden
on
the
union,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
see
how
that
could
be
an
unreasonable
request.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
what...
what
burden
would
there
be
on
the
union?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is.
we
may
lay
down
a
more
general
rule,
but
it
very
definitely
is
about
brown's
request.
we
decide
the
cases
on
the
facts
before
us.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of...
let's
apply
a
[inaudible]
rule
that
you
have
to...
the
only
thing
you
can
claim
for
yourself
is
what
others
could
claim
equally,
without
hurting
anybody.
what
hurt
would
come
to
the
union
if
numerous
candidates
requested
mailing
information
and
mailing
at
their
own
expense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so...
you're
saying
that,
what,
is
it
time
spent
by
union
employees
that
would
be
the
burden?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
define
bona
fide
candidate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
these
candidates,
people
who
don't
qualify,
will
ultimately
be
filtered
out
at
some
stage
of
the
proceedings.
i
still
don't
see
why,
even
if...
if
a
person
who
perhaps
isn't
ultimately
going
to
qualify
for
the
nomination,
if
that
person
wants
to
circulate
campaign
literature
at
his
own
expense,
what
harm
that
does
to
the
union.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say,
in
other
words,
that
only
someone
who
can
meet
all
the
union's
rules
for
nomination
is
entitled
to
have
the
campaign
literature
distributed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pierson.
mr.
levy,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
levy,
in
your
first
suggestion
as
to
how
the
rule
should
be...
the
statute
should
be
interpreted,
you
say
that
is
the
request
reasonable
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances.
would
one
of
the
circumstances
be
the
existence
of
the
union
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
supposing
there's
a
request
for
literature
distribution
as
of
july
1,
and
the
union
rule
says
we're
not
going
to
distribute
any
until
july
10,
and
the
election
is
a
year
away.
that
might
affect
the
reasonableness
of
the
request,
might
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levy.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
pierson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pierson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1330,
international
organization
of
master,
mates
&
pilots
versus
brown
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens
as
well
another
case.
