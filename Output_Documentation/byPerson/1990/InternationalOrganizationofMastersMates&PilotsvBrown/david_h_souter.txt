justice

mr.
pierson,
one
of
the
points
made
on
the
other
side
was
that
mr.
brown
wanted
other
potential
candidates
to
know
in
advance
that
he
was
serious
in
running
himself,
so
that
others
in
effect
might
stand
by
and
not
declare
themselves,
as
long
as
they
knew
someone
who
espoused
their
position
was
going
to
run.
do
you
take
exception
to
that
as
a
factual
claim?
justice
souter
all
right.
justice
souter
so
that
the...
i'm
sorry.
justice
souter
okay.
all
right.
the
right,
then,
to
circulate
literature
at
the
time
mr.
brown
wanted
to,
would
tend,
or
have
a
tendency
to
limit
the
possible
field
of
candidates
who
come
forward
to
challenge
the
incumbents,
then.
that
would
be
fair
to
say,
wouldn't
it?
justice
souter
so,
the
upshot
of
those
two
points
is
that
if
mr.
brown
and
others
like
him
are
allowed
to
come
forward
and
circulate
literature
at
the
time
that
they
want
to
do
it,
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
challenges
to
incumbent
union
leadership
will
be
stronger
challenges,
and
conversely,
that
the
union
leadership
would
have
an
interest
in
preventing
challenges
of
such
strength
by
the
very
rule
that
we
have
in
this
case.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
souter
they
want
a
scattering
of
candidates
rather
than
one
or
two
strong
candidates
against
them.
justice
souter
but
it's
still
the
case,
isn't
it,
that
the...
that
however
adopted,
this
rule
tends
to
favor
incumbents,
as
against
the
rule,
or
lack
of
rule
if
you
will,
that
the
petitioner
would
have?
justice
souter
but
this
one
in
fact
has
a
definite
tendency
to
do
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
souter
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
was
necessarily
adopted
with
that
motivation
on
the
part
of
any
individuals
or
segment
of
the
union,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
its
natural
tendency,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
need
fact
finding
for
that
purpose.
justice
souter
but
don't
you
want
to
concede
that
the
rule
should
be
given
deference
so
long
as
the
rule
does
not
have
a
tendency
to
disfavor
insurgents?
