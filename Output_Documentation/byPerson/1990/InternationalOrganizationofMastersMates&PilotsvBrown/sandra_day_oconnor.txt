justice
o'connor
mr.
pierson,
i
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
in
finding
the
union
rule
unreasonable?
justice
o'connor
and
if
we
thought
the
rule
were
unreasonable,
i
guess
we
would--
justice
o'connor
--you
think
it
should
be
remanded--
justice
o'connor
--to
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
determination
if,
it
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration?
justice
o'connor
well,
apart
from
the
rule,
do
you
think
there
is
anything
unreasonable
about
the
respondent's
request
to
communicate
before
the
convention?
justice
o'connor
well,
my
question
is
do
you
think
there
is
anything
unreasonable
about
that
request,
apart
from
the
union's
rule?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
union
didn't
have
a
rule,
i
suppose
it
certainly
is
possible
to
answer
that
question.
justice
o'connor
and
my
question
to
you
is,
absent
the
rule,
is
there
anything
unreasonable
about
the
request?
justice
o'connor
what
level
of
scrutiny
do
you
think
we
need
to
apply
in
evaluating
the
union's
rule,
if
it
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
a
level
of
scrutiny
of
rationality,
in
effect?
i
mean,
is
there
anything
in
particular
about
this
scheme
that
requires
any
special
level
of
scrutiny?
justice
o'connor
mr.
levy,
the
secretary
says
that
she
is
entitled
to
deference
in
interpreting
the
statute,
and
yet
one
of
her
regulations
says
that
in
order
to
avoid
charges
of
disparity
of
treatment
among
candidates,
it
is
advised
that
a
union
inform
all
candidates
in
advance
of
the
conditions
under
which
distribution
will
be
made,
and
promptly
advise
them
of
any
change
in
those
conditions.
now,
does
that,
in
your
view,
enable
unions
to
establish
a
range
of
conditions
that
have
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
reasonableness
of
a
request?
some
of
them
might
include
the
things
mentioned
by
the
chief
justice,
for
instance,
2
days'
notice
so
we
can
assemble
a
list,
or,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
in
writing.
and
maybe
another
could
be
payment
in
cash
in
advance
of
the
mailing
of
the
cost
that
we
determine
it
will
entail.
now,
are
those
things
subject
to
union
rule,
if
you
will?
and
must
those
things
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
reasonableness
of
the
candidate's
request?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
might
mean
if
you
change
your
rule,
let
us
know.
justice
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
i
hope
in
the
course
of
your
remarks
you
will
tell
us
exactly
what
it
is
we
need
to
defer
to
the
secretary
on,
and
whether
there
is
room
in
this
scheme
for
union
regulations
of
such
things
as
all
requests
will
be
made
in
writing,
they
will
be
made
2
days
in
advance
of
the
date
for
mailing,
and
it
will
include...
you
will
have
to
pay
us
in
cash
or
postal
money
order,
or
something
of
that
sort,
in
advance.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
fact
is
it's
desirable
for
everyone
to
know
requests
have
to
be
made
in
writing
or
not,
they
have
to
be
accompanied
by
payment
or
not,
they
have
to
give
at
least
x
number
of
days'
or
hours'
notice
or
not.
that's
important,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
now,
does
the
secretary
leave
room
for
a
union
to
establish
those
administrative
requirements
by
rule?
justice
o'connor
and
if
so,
and
a
court
is
faced
with,
or
a
union,
with
deciding
whether
a
request
for
campaign
mailing
is
reasonable,
should
it
take
into
consideration
the
existence
of
that
kind
of
rule?
justice
o'connor
and
the
secretary
thinks
that's
appropriate?
justice
o'connor
and
is
not
asking
us
to
not
interpret
it...
well,
is
not
telling
us
that
those
kinds
of
rules
may
not
be
considered.
