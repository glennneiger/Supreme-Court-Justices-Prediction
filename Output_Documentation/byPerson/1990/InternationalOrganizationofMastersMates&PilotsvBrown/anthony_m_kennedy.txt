justice
kennedy
well,
if
we
determine
that
you
look
first
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
request,
that's
the
focus
of
the
statute,
and
that
one
factor
in
the
calculus
of
reasonableness
is
to
look
at
the
union
rule
and
to
look
at
its
reasoning
and
its
purpose,
if
that's
what
we
hold,
do
we
have
to
remand
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals,
it
said
we
look
just
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
request.
we
don't
look
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule,
even
as
one
of
the
determinants
in
evaluating
the
statutory
sufficiency
of
the
request.
now,
if
we
disagree
with
that
and
say
that
the
rule
is
one
of
the
factors
you
look
at
in
this
calculus
of
reasonableness,
then
don't
we
have
to
remand?
