mr.
w.
michel
pierson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
401(c)
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
which
places
a
duty
upon
unions
to
distribute,
on
behalf
of
candidates
for
union
office,
campaign
literature
upon
their
reasonable
requests.
in
posing
the
issue
of
how
to
determine
what
is
reasonable
request,
the
case
raises
issues
involving
the
competing
policies
underlying
lmrda,
which
are
the
furtherance
of
union
democracy
and
the
prevention
of
unnecessary
interference
with
the
internal
affairs
of
unions.
we
submit
that
the
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit,
which
held
that
the
mm&p's
election
procedure
was
not
entitled
to
consideration
in
determining
whether
respondent's
request
to
distribute
literature
was
reasonable,
not
only
unduly
impairs
the
mm&p's
right
to
govern
its
own
affairs,
but
also
ultimately
is
contrary
to
union
democracy.
the
case
arose
in
the
summer
of
1988
when
brown,
stating
that
he
wished
to
be
a
candidate
for
president
in
the
upcoming
election
of
mm&p
officers,
made
a
request
to
the
union
to
be
permitted
to
disseminate
literature
prior
to
the
convention,
which
was
scheduled
for
august
of
1988.
the
union
denied
the
request
based
upon
its
longstanding
election
procedure
set
forth
in
its
constitution,
which
provides
that
the
right
to
mailing
begins
only
when
the
ballot
committee
of
rank-and-file
members
that
runs
the
election
is
elected
at
the
convention.
brown
brought
suit
under
section
401(c).
the
case
was
heard
2
weeks
later
on
a
motion
for
temporary
restraining
order,
and
the
district
court
held
in
favor
of
respondent.
the
court
not
only
held
that
the
focus
should
be
on
whether
the
request
was
reasonable,
but
that
the
rule
itself
was
unreasonable.
the
case
then
went
to
the
fourth
circuit,
which
affirmed,
expressly
distinguishing
precedent
from
other
circuits,
and
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
in
determining
how
to
construe
section--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--it
did
not.
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
speaks
only
in
terms
of
the
legal
issue,
finding
that
it
should
consider--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--well
i,
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
proper
forum
to
determine
the
reasonableness--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--yes.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
that
is
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proper
course
would
be
to
remand
to
the
fourth
circuit
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion,
because
one
of
the
subsidiary
questions
involved,
assuming
the
court
does
hold
that
the
union's
rule
is
entitled
to
be
respected--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--our
position
in
this
case
is
based
solely
upon
our
election
procedure,
and
we
contend
that
the
request--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--if
we
were
litigating
this
case
in
another
union
that
did
not
have
that
provision
in
the
constitution,
then...
well,
let
me
back
up
for
a
moment,
because
this
gets
to
one
of
the
problems
in
the
distinction
between
the
fourth
circuit's
approach
and
the
third
circuit's
approach,
which
is
that
a
request
is
not
reasonable
or
unreasonable
in
a
vacuum.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
in
the
context
of
the
union's
elections
procedures.
so
that
i
think
a
more
appropriate
answer
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
might
be
that
it's
not
possible
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
a
request
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
except
as--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--if...
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
the...
we
do
not
take
the
position
in
this
litigation
that
we...
his
request
is
unreasonable
separate
and
apart
from
its
relation
to
the
union's
rule.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
promulgation
of
the
union's
rule,
the
circumstances
of
the
union's
election
procedure,
that
is,
whether
there
has
been
abuse
of
the
type
that
lmrda
was
intended
to
combat,
entrenched
incumbents
who
abused
channels
of
communication
with
the
membership,
and
also--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--well,
i
would
say
that
rationality
is
one
aspect
of
it,
but
i
would
also
say
that
if
there
is
a
showing
that
the
rule
was
adopted
solely
to
impair
the
rights
of
candidates
to
communicate
with
the
membership...
now,
i
suppose
that's
an
aspect
of
rationality
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
what
were
the
reasons
for
adoption
of
the
rule
and
the
circumstances
of
the
adoption
of
the
rule.
but
i
would
not
see
any
reason
for
heightened
scrutiny.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic
rationality
test
would
be
adequate.
if
we
begin
with
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
reasonable
requests,
and
by
fashioning
that
standard
the
statute
imposes
a
duty
upon
unions
to
measure
requests
to
determine
whether
they
are
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
in
performing
that
duty,
we
submit
that
it
is
far
preferable
for
the
union
to
have
a
rule
that
governs
all
requests.
it
eliminates
any
possibility
of
discrimination,
it
provides
advance
notice
to
all
candidates
of
the
conditions
under
which
distribution
of
literature
can
be
made,
and
it
prevents
manipulation
of
the
election
procedures
by
the
incumbents
in
the
granting
or
denial
of
requests.
so
that
in
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
the
statute
does
not
preclude
the
adoption
of
a
reasonable
rule,
and
therefore
we
must
look
at
the
policy
underlying
the
statute
to
resolve
this
question.
now,
it
is
certainly
true
that
one
of
the
policies
underlying
lmrda
was
the
prevention
of
abuse
by
entrenched
incumbents,
and
congress
passed
lmrda
in
order
to
further
union
democracy
in
the
face
of
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
mcclellan
committee
of
abuse
by
entrenched
incumbents
in
a
sample
of
unions
that
the
committee
examined.
but
the
fact
that
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
does
not
necessarily
say
anything
about
the
construction
of
section
401(c).
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
section
401(c)
in
terms
of
incumbents
or
insurgents.
in
fact,
the
entire
statute,
all
of
lmrda,
was
passed
for
this
very
reason,
that
is
to
prevent
abuse
by
incumbents
because
of
evidence
that
incumbents
had
abused
their
advantages
in
a
number
of
ways:
not
holding
elections,
disenfranchising
significant
portions
of
the
membership,
everything
to
violence.
nonetheless,
the
balance
of
lmrda,
the
sections
other
than
401(c),
make
repeated
reference
to
union
rules
and
union
constitutions.
in
fact,
throughout
the
statute
there
are
no
less
than
eight
references
to
union
constitutions.
the
statute
requires
labor
organization
to
adopt
constitutions.
the
statute
provides
that
labor
organizations
may
not
impair
members
rights
under
the
constitutions.
the
election
procedures
themselves
make
repeated
reference
to
union
rules
that
regulate
the
election
procedure.
one
of
the
ways
that
congress
intended
to
combat
abuse
by
entrenched
incumbents
was
by
requiring
adherence
to
union
constitutions
and
union
rules
of
procedure,
and
that
is
apparent
from
the
structure
of
the
entire
act.
so
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
section
401(c).
section
401(c)
is
not
the
only
section
that
affects
the
rights
of
insurgents
or
the
power
of
incumbents
to
preserve
their
position
in
office.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well,
the...
the
union
power
to
regulate
the
election
procedure
might
affect
campaign
requests
in
a
number
of
ways.
and
it
might
affect
campaign
requests
in
a
number
of
ways
that
could
conceivably
impose
a
burden
upon
one
seeking
union
office.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
say
that
the
only
question
in
construing
section
401(c)
would
be
will
it
benefit
the
candidate
or
not.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor?
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well,
this
case
is
not
simply
about,
from
the
mm&p's
standpoint,
brown's
request
for
literature.
brown--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--i
know,
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this,
that
brown
was
not
the
only
candidate
running
for
office
in
the
1988
election,
and
the
presidential
election
was
not
the
only
election
being
held
there.
the...
the
election
procedures
in
the
mm&p
constitution
govern
elections
for
all
offices,
that
is,
all
the
vice
presidents,
the
convention
delegates,
and
the
procedure
was
set
up
to
govern
all
of
those
contests.
so
that
it
may
always
be
true
in
looking
at
a
single
request
that
one
might
say
that
granting
this
request
will
not
burden
the
union.
that
does
not,
however,
contradict
the
fact--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--simply
that
it
would
impose
a
greater
burden
upon
the
union
to
grant
those
requests
at
a
time
before
it
has
made
the
determination
as
to
who
is
a
bona
fide
candidate.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
that's
not...
no,
we're
not
saying
that's
the
sole
burden,
your
honor.
we
are
also
saying
that
the
union
has
an
interest
in
ensuring
that
its
literature
distribution
provisions
are
used
only
by
bona
fide
candidates.
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
was
specifically
in
the
legislative
history
and
resulted
in
the
section
401(c)
being
passed
in
the
way
that
it
was.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
we
would...
the
mm&p
constitution
requires
that
candidates
meet
a
number
of
requirements
at
the
time
they
are
nominated
in
order
to
be
eligible.
they
have
to...
there
is
a
continuous
dues
payment
requirement,
so
that
a
member
must
have
paid
his
dues
continuously
in
advance
for
the
2
years
preceding
the
nomination.
there
is
a
requirement
that
a
member
serve
under
his
license
for
a
period
of
180
days
during
the
period.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
institutional
interest
in
seeing
that
the
right
is
not
abuse.
now,
the
department
of
labor
regulations
provide
that
the
union
is
not
entitled
to
censor
campaign
literature
and
it
is
not
entitled
to
see
campaign
literature
before
it
goes
out.
so
that
if
the...
if
there
were
no
rule
regulating
the
distribution
procedure
and
we
simply
provided
that
anybody
at
anytime,
regardless
of
how
close
it
is
to
an
election,
could
come
in
and
request
distribution
of
literature,
then
that
would
be
a
way
that
would
harm
the
union's
interest
in
limiting
use
of
the
distribution
procedure
to
bona
fide
candidates.
now--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--i
am
saying
that
the
rule
in
this
case,
because
it
provides
for
the
distribution
right
at
a
time
when
the
ballot
committee,
an
independent
organization
of
rank
and
file
members,
has
determined
who
is
a
candidate,
that
it
is
reasonable
to
draw
the
line
there.
that
a
line
that
is
drawn
in
terms
of
the
union's
election
procedure
is
more
reasonable
than...
what
i'm
saying
is
we're
not
talking
about
an
arbitrary
rule
that
somebody
made
up
just
to
draw
a
bright
line.
now,
i
am
saying
that
that
is
one
of
the
interests
that
the
union
has
in
enforcing
its
rule.
another
interest
that
the
union
has
in
this
case
is
in
enforcing
a
rule
that
was
not
made
up
by
the
officers,
but
was
adopted
as
part
of
the
union's
constitution
that
was
approved
by
the
entire
membership
and
is
part
of
a
detailed
set
of
election
procedures
for
regulation
of
the
election
and
fits
in
with
those.
so
that
it
really
is
a
matter
of
extracting
from
that
detailed
procedure
this
one
rule
and
carving
it
out,
and
that
denies
the
interest
that
the
union
has
in
enforcing
the
entire
election
procedure.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
the
language
of
the
statute?
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
i
appreciate
that.
[laughter]
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well
that
requires
us
to
answer
the
question
of
what
is
the
secretary's
interpretation.
the
secretary
wrote
a
letter
at
respondent's
request
concerning
the
request
that
was
made
in
this
case.
that
letter
was
not
necessarily
compelled
or
required
by
anything
that's
in
the
secretary's
regulations.
in
fact,
the
secretary's
regulations
simply
say
that
a
union
may
not
adopt
a
rule
forbidding
all
requests.
well,
that
seems
apparent
from
the
express
language
of
the
statute
itself
that
the
union
must
grant
reasonable
requests.
that
the
union
should
give
advance
notice
to
all
candidates
of
the
conditions
under
which
distribution
should
be
made...
will
be
made,
which
we
submit
furthers
the
idea
of
having
a
rule
in
order
to
give
advance
notice,
and
provides
certain
things
regarding
bona
fide
candidates,
which
regulation
is
based
upon
the
yablonski
case,
in
which
yablonski
needed
the
support
of
people
in
order
to
be
nominated.
and
the
secretary,
based
on
that,
phrased
a
regulation
that
said
that
a
candidate
may
distribute
literature
before
nomination.
so
that
we
submit
that
there
is
no
consistent
interpretation
that
governs
the
precise
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
it
does
come
within
his
administration,
your
honor.
but
i
submit
that
the
court
may
determine
the
policies
underlying
the
statute,
and
those
policies
have
been
determined
and
applied
and
identified
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases,
beginning
with
calhoon
v.
harvey,
continuing
through
the
glass
bottle
blowers
case,
and
all
the
way
up
through
sadlowski.
and
that
the
court
has
clearly
identified
the
policies,
and
this
is
not
the
date
at
which
that
history
should
be
rewritten.
the
competing
policies
of
lmrda
are
clear.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
that
is
certainly
a
possible
interest
of
a
candidate--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--in
requesting
a
right
to
distribute
literature.
i--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--i
do
take
exception
to
any
factual
findings
in
this
case
because
of
the
nature
in
which
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
and
the
fact
that
the
district
court
would
not
permit
us
to
put
on
evidence.
but
i
don't
take
exception
to
that
factual
possibility.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
that
would
be
fair
to
say,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
incumbent
leadership
would
have
an
interest
in
denying
such
challenges.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
but
we...
where
i
take
exception
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
is
when
you
say
"by
the
very
rule
that
was
applied
in
this
case.
"
we
submit
that
what
this
case
is
about
is
the
fact
that
this
rule
was
not
adopted
by
the
incumbents,
but
is
part
of
the
union
constitution.
and
that
the
very
reason
that
we
want
this
rule
enforced
is
to
prevent
manipulation
by
incumbents.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
any
type
of
rule
might
favor
incumbents
or
favor
insurgents.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
finding
or
a
conclusion
that
the
court
can
reach
upon
the
state
of
this
record.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
really
insufficient
factual
development
to
say
that
this
rule
was
adopted
for
or
has
that
effect.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
it
seems
to
me
that
it
also
could
be
said
that
any
rule
that
places
any
restriction
upon
the
right
to
distribute
literature
could
favor
incumbents.
if
you
take
respondent's
argument
to
its
greatest
extent,
which
is
done
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
i
think,
any
rule
that
would
prevent
an
incumbent
from
distributing
literature
8
years
in
advance...
i
mean
an
insurgent
from
distributing
literature
8
years
in
advance
would
have
an
effect
that
might
favor
incumbents.
the
statute,
i
submit,
is
not
to
be
construed
solely
in
terms
of
that,
but
in
terms
of
the
entire
question
of
whether
the
rule
promotes
democracy
or
subverts
democracy.
one
element
in
that
is
whether
there
is
an
undue
advantage
afforded
to
incumbents
by
virtue
of
the
union
procedure.
but
that
is
only
one
element,
and
i
submit
is
not
the
only
element
that
the
court
should
take
into
account.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
would
be...
the
advantage
of
the
union's
test
would
be
that...
the
first
question
would
be
is
the
rule
unreasonable.
we
have
never
said
that
any
rule
should
be
enforced,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
our
position
is
we
start
with
whether
the
rule
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
candidate
to
make
some
showing,
a
factual
showing,
that
the
rule
either
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
favoring
incumbents,
or
that
the
rule
has
the
effect
of
inhibiting
democracy
within
the
union,
or
that
there
is
something
else
that
is
defective
about
the
circumstances
of
promulgation
or
application
of
the
rule.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well
that,
that
would
have
other
problems,
though,
because
such
a
rule
would
then
place
in
the
hands
of
the
incumbents,
that
is
the
union's
officers,
the
duty
of
determining
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
a
request
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
no
one
in
this
case,
including
the
respondent
and
the
united
states,
has
contended
that
there
are
not
some
unreasonable
requests,
that
the
statute
does--
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
--the
statute
compels
you
to
do
that.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
the
statute
does
not
tell
you
how
to
do
that,
but
the
statute
does
compel
you
to
do
that.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
yes.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well,
what
i
was
saying
was
that
there
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
a
determination
could
favor
the
interest
of
an
insurgent
candidate,
but
that
democracy
is
not
simply
equivalent
to
whether
the
insurgent
candidate
is
hindered
or
helped.
and
that
has
been
made
the
sole
constructional
factor
in
the
statute
by
the
approach
that
has
been
taken
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that
it's
simply
a
question
of
does
this
help
the
insurgent,
and
if
so,
that
is
the
way
the
statute
has
to
be
construed.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
well,
they
are
saying
that
any
rule...
that
any
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
gives
any
sway
to
a
union
rule
necessarily
favors
incumbents.
they
are
saying
that
the
focus
cannot
be
on
the
union
rule,
and
that
if
it
is
it
favors
incumbents.
with
the
court's
leave,
i
respectfully
wish
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
michel
pierson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
argument
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
from
a
review
of
the
transcript,
proceeded
solely
upon
the
legal
question
of
how
to
determine
whether
a
request
was
reasonable,
that
is
by
reference
to
the
rule
or
otherwise.
and
in
fact,
the
first
thing
that
the
union
tried
to
show
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
was
that
respondent
had
made
other
communications
with
the
membership
and
had
other
channels
of
communication,
and
then
the
case
immediately
went
off
on
the
discussion
of
how
to
construe
the
statute.
we
therefore
submit
that
if
this
court
should
agree
with
our
position
a
remand
is
necessary,
and
that
this
court
cannot
determine
the
reasonableness
of
this
rule
upon
the
face
of
this
record.
with
respect
to
the
test
in
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
it
seems
to
me
that
two
things
are
apparent.
number
one
that,
and
i
do
not
mean
to
equivocate
in
answer
to
a
question,
but
the
argument
that
there
is
an
intersection
between
reasonable
rules
and
reasonable
requests,
and
that
applying
the
union's
approach
will
result
in
the
denial
of
reasonable
requests
because
of
the
rule,
really
is
not
the
way
that
the
section
intends.
what
i
mean
is
this,
that
it
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
a
request
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
without
looking
at
the
context
of
the
union's
election
procedure,
and
therefore
it
is
meaningless
to
talk
about
whether
a
rule
is
reasonable
in
the
abstract.
and
that
what
the
district
judge
did
in
this
case
was
meaningless,
because
he
said
i
find
per
se
that
this
request
is
reasonable.
second,
it
also
seems
apparent
that
any
rule
that
can
be
posited
could
work
a
disadvantage
to
an
insurgent
candidate,
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
rule
that
deals
with
the
timing
of
requests,
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
rule
such
as
in
the
provision
house
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
that
says
that
requests
have
to
be
in
by
a
certain
date
in
order
to
mail
literature.
any
rule,
no
matter
what
the
reasons
for
that
rule,
may
have
some
impact
upon
the
candidate's
ability
to
conduct
a
campaign.
that,
however,
is
not
the
only
factor
in
determining
whether
the
statute
is
complied
with
or
not.
and
the
test
we
propose
that
looks
at
the
rule
first,
that
permits
the
candidate
to
show
that
it
is
unreasonable,
based
upon
a
variety
of
factors,
effectuates
not
only
the
union's
reasonable
interest
in
governing
its
own
elections,
but
also
the
candidate's
interest
in
that
he
permits...
it
permits
him
to
show
that
somehow
there
has
been
abuse
or
somehow
the
rule
does
unfairly
impede
democracy.
