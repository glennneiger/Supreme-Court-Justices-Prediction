mr.
paul
alan
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
this.
in
deciding
whether
a
union
has
satisfied
its
statutory
duty
to,
in
the
words
of
section
401(c),
comply
with
all
reasonable
requests
from
any
candidate
to
mail
campaign
literature
at
the
candidate's
own
expense,
should
a
court
focus,
as
the
lower
courts
did
and
as
the
secretary
of
labor
agrees
they
should,
on
the
question
whether
the
request
itself
is
reasonable
in
light
of
all
the
circumstances,
or
does
the
case
stand
or
fall
on
a
determination
of
whether
the
request
satisfies
a
union
rule,
and
whether
that
union
rule
is
reasonable
in
its
general
application.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
think
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
existence
of
a
union
rule
is
something
that
it
would
be
useful
for
the
court
to
consider,
and
indeed,
although
the
district
court
focused
squarely
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
union
rule,
even
the
court
of
appeals
took
note
of
the
union
rule
and
also
noted
that
it
had
an
adverse
effect
on
the
ability
of
insurgents
to
run
for
office.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
don't
know
that
the
existence
of
the
rule
would
affect
the
reasonableness
of
the
request.
it
may
be
that
one
would
look
to
the
circumstance
of
how
far
away
the
election
is
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule,
the
reasonableness
of
the
request,
although
i
would
say,
i
would
argue
that
the
fact
that
the
election
is
a
year
away
would
not
necessarily
make
the
request
unreasonable,
regardless
of
the
existence
of
the
union
rule.
but
i
don't
think,
in
square
answer
to
your
question,
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
union
rule
on
that
question
would
provide
much
if
any
assistance
to
the
court
in
deciding
whether
the
rule
was
reasonable.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
a
rule
goes
to
the
union's
administrative
burden
in
dealing
with
a
request
and
possible
ensuing
litigation--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--we
want
to
make
as
few
mailings
as
possible,
i
would
argue,
is
not
an
admissible
reason
for
not
making
particular
mailings.
on
the
other
hand,
if--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--i
believe
that
with
respect
to
that
hypothetical,
that
given
the
union's
need
to
be
sure...
i
don't
know
what
the
union's
argument
for
that
particular
rule
would
be.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
no,
our
position
is
this.
that
if
the
union
can
point
to
particular
administrative
burdens
which
have
to
be
satisfied
with
respect
to
any
rule,
i
would
not
have
the
court
let
the
union
decide
whether
there
are
such
administrative
burdens.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide
itself
in
judging
the
reasonableness
of
the
request.
but
if
we
hypothesize
that
there's
an
administrative
burden,
for
example,
an
amount
of
time
to
put
out
a
mailing,
so
that
the
union
says
we
need
a
request
2
days
in
advance.
and
the
union
says
this
is
the
way
we
are
going
to
deal
with
the
administrative
burden,
and
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
we
can
deal
with
the
administrative
burden,
each
of
which
makes
it
somewhat
more
difficult
or
delays
the
making
of
the
request.
and
the
union
announces
in
advance,
this
is
the
way
we
are
going
to
do
it.
and
the
candidate
ignores
the
union's
announcement
in
advance
that
this
is
the
way
we're
going
to
handle
this
kind
of
problem,
i
would
allow
the
union,
perhaps,
to
make
the
judgment
that
this,
as
opposed
to
that
equivalent
way
of
meeting
the
burden
of
making
requests,
is
appropriate.
and
the
fact
that
the
union
had
announced
its
procedure
in
advance
would
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
ultimately
in
deciding
whether
the
request
was
reasonable.
now,
i'm
not
sure
how
i
would
apply
that
to
the
particular
rule
that
you
hypothesize
in
your
question,
because
i'm
not
sure
what
the
administrative
burden
argument
is
that
the
union...
in
either
case,
whether
it's
a
reasonable
rule
or
a
reasonable
request,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
decide
is
the
request
reasonable.
but
i'm
not
sure
what
argument
the
union
would
make
in
favor
of
that
particular
procedure,
whether
it
be
called
the
union
rule
or
otherwise,
in
advance
of
making
a
request.
i
don't
know
if
i
have
answered
your
question.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
one
point
before
i
turn
to
how
i
would
answer
the
question
that
i
posed
at
the
beginning
with
respect
to
the
factual
posture
of
the
case.
we
filed
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
a
motion
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
we
put
in
affidavits;
they
put
in
affidavits.
at
the
beginning
of
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing...
and
i
might
add
one
of
the
points
made
in
the
affidavit
which
is
uncontradicted
to
date
was
that
one
of
the
reasons
brown
wanted
to
do
his
mailing
at
the
time
he
did
was
to
tell
other
people
that
he
was
running.
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
the
union
said
we
may
be
able
to
solve...
resolve
this
case
on
the
record
as
it
is,
but
if
there
are
factual
conflicts
we
reserve
the
right
to
put
on
evidence.
the
union
never
disputed
that
fact,
it
never
disputed
the
fact
that
the
union,
the
incumbents
had
used
the
union
newspaper,
not
abused
it,
just
used
the
union
newspaper
to
communicate
their
views
and
exclude
the
views
of
others.
so
we
don't
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
finds
it
necessary
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
rule
is
reasonable,
we
don't
think
that
the
state
of
the
record
is
a
bar
to
the
court's
deciding
the
case
on
the
record
as
it
stands.
the
union
also,
although
mr.
pierson,
i
don't
know
whether
he
finally
answered
your
question.
it
certainly
attempted
to
equivocate
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
union
has
never
argued
in
this
case
that
the
request
is
unreasonable
except
insofar
as
it
contradicts
a
rule
which
it
regards
as
reasonable.
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
decides
this
case.
the
statute
does
not
require
members
to
comply
with,
quote,
"reasonable
union
rules".
it
requires
unions
to
comply
with
all
of
a
candidate's
reasonable
requests.
we
think
this
language
of
the
statute
could
not
be
clearer,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
are,
as
mr.
pierson
points
out,
other
parts
of
the
statute
which
do
refer
to
reasonable
union
rules
and
which
subject
rights
to
reasonable
union
rules.
congress
chose
not
to
do
so
here.
the
union
makes
a
variety
of
arguments
about
why
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
focus
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
union's
rules,
but
the
fundamental
objection
to
that
argument
is
that
that
is
not
what
congress
said
to
do.
and
what
they
really
want
the
court
to
do
is
to
rewrite
the
statute
in
that
respect.
moreover,
focusing
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
request
rather
than
on
the
union's
rule
is
also
supported
by
congress'
purpose
in
passing
this
part
of
the
statute.
congress
recognized
that
union
candidates
have
special
problems
in
communicating
with
the
voters,
and
it
enacted
section
401(c)
to
help
candidates
overcome
those
disadvantages.
and
to
understand
why
it's
appropriate
to
look
at
the
reasonable...
inappropriate,
excuse
me,
to
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
union
rule
in
deciding
when
the
right
to
do
a
mailing
should
be
limited,
it
is
important
to
appreciate
the
serious
communications
problem
that
an
insurgent
candidate
faces.
unlike
a
public
election,
the
complete
list
of
voters
is
secret.
only
the
union
has
it.
and
unlike
a
public
election,
the
union
leaders,
in
addition
to
being
in
constant
contact
with
the
membership
in
the
course
of
their
duties,
also
control
the
union
newspaper,
which
they
use
to
communicate
their
views
on
union
affairs
and
to
trumpet
their
successes
on
the
members
behalf,
which
they
do
year
in
and
year
out.
union
newspapers
do
not
provide
campaign
coverage,
as
the
public
press
does
with
respect
to
public
elections.
and,
at
least
in
most
unions,
a
candidate
cannot
buy
advertising
space
in
a
camp...
in
a
union
publication.
finally,
the
union
members
are
widely
dispersed
through
the
general
population.
admittedly
in
this
union
the
problem
of
dispersion
is
somewhat
extreme,
but
the
problem
exists
to
some
extent
in
every
union.
and
to
reach
all
the
voters
by...
through
the
public
media,
a
candidate
would
have
to
buy
space
or
time
in
media
which
are
disseminated
to
the
general
public,
and
particularly
in
a
national
election,
that
would
be
a
prohibitive
cost.
so
it
can--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--no.
it
goes
to
show
that,
but
it
also
goes--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--as
we
argued
in
opposing
cert
in
this
case,
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
patently
unreasonable
rule,
and
maybe
you
should
wait
for
a
better
case
to
decide
this
question
of
whether
you
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
request.
but
the
points
i
am
making
also
go
to
the
question
of
how
you
should
construe
the
statute.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
because
section
401(c)
was
a
remedy
for
the
problem
that
i
have
just
described,
it
should
be
construed
in
a
way
which
helps
to
even
the
playing
field.
adoption
of
the
union's
approach,
we
submit,
would
make
it
far
more
difficult
for
union
members
to
exercise
the
right
to
do
campaign
mailings.
and
there
are
three
reasons
why
that
is
so.
first,
the
union
concedes
that
its
approach
establishes
a
presumption
that
the
union's
rule
is
proper,
and
it
is
up
to
the
candidate
to
establish
that
the
union's
rule
is
unreasonable.
so
under
the
union's
rule,
approach,
which
they
set
forth
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
11,
some
requests
which
are
otherwise
reasonable
could
be
denied
because
the
union
has
a
rule
which
is
reasonable
in
its
general
application.
the
fact
that
a
particular
candidate
has
particular
needs
could
not
be
considered.
and
so
the
question
is
whose
interests
should
receive
deference
in
the
close
cases,
which
we
submit
this
is
not.
in
the
close
cases,
whose
interests
should
receive
deference?
it's
close
cases
where
deference
makes
a
difference.
should
it
be
the
interests
of
the
union
leadership
in
denying
a
mailing,
or
should
it
be
the
interest
of
the
candidate
in
having
it
done?
and
what
we
argue
is
that
because
it
is
so
clear
that
this
part
of
the
statute
was
meant
to
favor
challengers
by
providing
them
with
a
vital
means
for
overcoming
the
advantages
of
incumbency,
and
because
the
market
provides
a
strong
incentive
for
candidates
not
to
make
unreasonable
requests.
they
have
to
pay
for
the
mailings,
so
they're
less
likely
to
make
a
request
for
mailing
where
they
don't
really
need
it.
it
is
most
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
in
those
circumstances
to
tip
the
balance
in
favor
of
the
challenger,
and
hold
that
it
is
the
challenger
who
has
the
power
to
make
any
request
within
the
range
of
reasonableness,
rather
than
that
the
union
has
the
power.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
first
with
respect
to
how
i
understand
the
secretary's
rule
and,
second,
a
more
general
response.
i
understand
the
secretary's
regulation
to
say
that
unions,
to
the
extent
that
they
have
established
procedure,
should
provide
notice
of
those
procedures.
but
the
secretary
does
not
anticipate
fixed,
unchanging
rules,
because
the
very
same
regulation
says,
and
if
you
change
the
procedures,
be
sure
you
send
out
notice.
so
it
doesn't...
the
secretary
obviously
doesn't
anticipate
a
fixed,
unchanging
rule,
but
rather
procedures--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--the
second
point...
the
second
point
is
that,
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
procedures
or
rules,
if
you
were,
that
you
are
describing,
those
kinds
of
rules,
because
they
deal
with
administrative
burdens
which
have
to
be
handled
some
way
in
connection
with
any
request,
given
the
statutory,
for
example,
requirement
of
payment
for
the
mailing,
my
arguments
about
adopting
a
non-deference
to
the
union
rule
approach
because
it
would
disserve
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
those
kinds
of
rules.
but
with
respect
to
the
rule
which
says
you
simply
can't,
no
matter
how
much
notice
you
give
us,
do
a
mailing
at
a
certain
amount
of
time
before,
more
than,
say,
10
days
before
the
ballots
go
out,
or
the
few
days
which
are
allowed
by
the
current
union
rule.
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
rule,
the
argument
that
i
make
fully
applies.
i
don't
know
if
i--
the
second
problem
with
the
union's
approach
is
that
every
time
a
union
member
wanted
to
challenge
the
denial
of
a
mailing
request
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
union's
system
with
respect
to
mailing
requests
as
a
whole
was
unreasonable,
or
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
rule
had
been
misapplied,
subject,
at
least
according
to
the
union,
to
the
rule
that
you
defer
to
the
incumbent's
interpretation
of
their
own
constitution.
now,
especially
because
the
union
member
has
to
hire
his
own
lawyer...
the
union,
of
course,
is
defended
by
union
counsel
at
union
expense...
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
make
that
kind
of
proof
in
the
context
of
a
preliminary
injunction
hearing,
with
the
election
looming,
these
burdens
would
make
it
difficult,
in
our
judgment,
for
the
court
to,
in
senator
javitz's
words,
act
and
act
in
time,
except
in
the
most
egregious
of
cases,
which
again,
i
would
emphasize
we
think
this
is.
so
that's
another
way
in
which
the
union's
approach,
focusing
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule,
disserves
congress'
purpose
of
helping
challengers
to
make
mailing
requests
when
they
need
them.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
there
is
going
to
be
a
rule
in
either
case.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
whether
it
is--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--there
is
going
to
be
a
rule
in
either
case
because
the
rule
is
going
to
be
set
by
the
union
leadership,
or
the
rule
is
going
to
be
set
by
common
law
adjudication
of
all
of
these
cases,
or
the
rule
is
going
to
be
set...
the
rule
of
what
is
reasonable
is
going
to
be
set
perhaps
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
the
question
is
do
you
give
deference
to
the
union
in
adopting
a
particular
rule.
if
a
union
wants
to
cabin
the
incumbent's
discretion,
it
can
do
that.
that
is
to
say
prevent
the
incumbents
from
enforcing
or
adopting
a
rule
which
would
make
requests
otherwise
reasonable...
excuse
me,
requests
otherwise
unreasonable,
permissible.
the
union
could
do
that.
what
the
union
can't
do
is
use
the
power
to
make
rules,
at
least
under
our
approach,
to
prevent
candidates
from
making
requests
which
would
otherwise
be
reasonable.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
don't
know
that
it's
the
tendency
to
favor...
to
disfavor
insurgents
that's
necessary,
because
if
that's
the
rule,
then
every
time
somebody
comes
in
with
a
challenge
to
your
denial
they
have
to
prove
the
tendencies
are
the
general
rule
in
the
context
of
a
preliminary
injunction
hearing.
