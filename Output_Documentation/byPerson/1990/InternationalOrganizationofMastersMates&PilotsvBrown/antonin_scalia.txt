justice
scalia
mr.
pierson,
i...
do
you...
is
it
your
position
that
it's
not
even
a
close
question,
that
the
language
couldn't
be
interpreted
the
way
mr.
brown
wants
to
interpret
it?
justice
scalia
yes.
i
mean,
it
does
say
all
reasonable
requests.
it
just
says
shall
comply
with
all
reasonable
requests
of
any
candidate,
and
the
difference
is
you
say
that
means
reasonable
in
light
of
the
union
rules,
and
brown
says
it
means
just
all
reasonable
requests,
union
rules
or
not.
now,
i
will
concede
that
your
interpretation
is
plausible.
is
the
other
one
not
even
plausible?
and
if
it
is...
just
so
you'll
know
where
i'm
leading
you,
if
it
is
plausible--
justice
scalia
--why
shouldn't
we
take
the
secretary's
interpretation,
which
i...
which
i
gather
has
been
consistent,
and
why
shouldn't
we
simply
apply
chevron
to
his
interpretation
of
this
provision?
justice
scalia
the
secretary
has
filed
a
brief
here
that
supports
mr.
brown.
do
you
deny
that
the
secretary
has
any
business
giving
an
interpretation
of
that
provision,
if
he
is
asked.
it
comes
within
his
administration,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
what
if
the
union
rule
says
requests
to
distribute...
it's
a
big
job...
requests
shall
be
in
writing
to
prevent
any
confusion,
and
a
particular
candidate
comes
up
and
orally
tells
the
president
of
the
union
i'd
like
to
have
this
mailed
out?
justice
scalia
right.
and
so
do
some
time
rules,
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
just
posited.
we
don't...
we
want
to
make
as
few
mailings
as
possible,
and--
justice
scalia
--i
see,
so
some
rules
are
okay
and
some
rules
are
not
okay?
you
can
have
rules
that
limit...
that
limit
the
request.
you
would
have
to
comply
with
the
rule
that
it
be
in
writing,
even
though
the
request
is
otherwise
reasonable,
it
would
have
to
comply
with
that
rule?
justice
scalia
so
it
depends
on
how
good
the
union's
argument
is.
so
if
the
union
has
a
good
enough
argument
for
a
time
limit,
then
that
would
be
all
right
too?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
either.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
all
of
that
goes
to
show
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
union
rule.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
your
real
complaint
here?
given,
especially
given
the
nature
of
your
union,
which,
many
of
its
members
being
off
at
sea
for
months
at
a
time,
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
rule?
justice
scalia
you
would
rather
have
the
challenger
fight
each
request
case
by
case
instead
of
being
able
to
proceed
under
a
rule
which,
if
he
complies
with,
he
knows
that
his
request
will
be
deemed
to
be
reasonable?
justice
scalia
why
is
there
going
to
be
a
rule?
justice
scalia
if
i
were...
if
i
were
union
management
with
the
bad
motivations
that
you
posit,
i
simply
wouldn't
have
a
rule,
and
say
okay,
you
want
to
do
it
this
way,
we'll
judge
case
by
case
whether
it's
reasonable.
go
hire
a
lawyer
each
time.
justice
scalia
let's
take
a
concrete
case.
suppose,
somebody
gave
this
instance
earlier,
of
somebody
who
wants
a
mailing
sent
out
on
july
1,
and
the
union
rule
says
we
won't
send
out
anything
until
july
5th.
justice
scalia
you
know,
i'd
say,
gee,
that's
pretty
unreasonable.
you
know,
the
union
says
we'll
send
it
the
5th,
you
want
us
to
go
through
this
whole
separate
mailing
just
for
4
days'
worth.
don't
be
unreasonable;
let
us
send
it
out
on
the
5th.
isn't
that...
can
you
use
the
rule
that
way?
justice
scalia
well,
the
request
is
thoroughly
reasonable
if
the
rule
doesn't
exist,
but
given
the
rule,
it
seems
unreasonable.
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no.
the
election
is
in
the
fall.
it's
in
october.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
the
election
is
in
october.
he
wants
it
mailed
on
the
1st.
justice
scalia
no
administrative
constraint--
--i
don't
think
you're
answering
these
questions,
mr.
feldman,
either
from
justice
o'connor
or
from
justice
scalia.
you
have
been
asked
twice
is
the
union
rule
a
factor
that
may
be
taken
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
the
request
is
reasonable.
now
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
justice
scalia
there's
no
constraint.
it
just
has...
the
union
doesn't
want
to
have
to
come
in
and
prove
a
constraint.
it
just
says
we...
it's
easier
for
us,
we
can
live
with
the...
we
could
do
the
july
1,
yes,
of
course.
but
it's
easy
for
us
to
know
that
we
get
geared
up
for
july
4th.
and
this
fellow
is
just,
you
know,
for
whatever
reason,
his
horoscope
or
anything
else,
he
says
july
1
is
when
the
mailing
has
to
go
out.
and
you,
if
i
understand
what
you
have
been
saying
to
both
me
and
justice
o'connor,
the
rule
in
and
of
itself
cannot
be
taken
into
account.
it
is
only
the
constraints
that
justify
the
rule
that
can
be
taken
into
account.
isn't
that
what
you
have
been
saying?
justice
scalia
why
don't
you
say
it
clearly?
