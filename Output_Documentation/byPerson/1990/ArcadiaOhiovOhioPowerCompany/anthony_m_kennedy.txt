justice
kennedy
mr.
wallace,
the
thrust
of
the
power
company's
argument
was
that
the
sec
orders
were
either
not
enforceable,
or
that
they
didn't
really
set
a
cost
requirement.
do
you
agree
with
the
entire
argument
that
was
made
by
the
power
company
on
this
point?
justice
kennedy
you
did
take
the
position
that
the
power
company
can
ignore
the
three
orders
of
the
sec
on
sales
above...
sales
at
cost?
justice
kennedy
so
would
you
have
any
objection
if
we
wrote
an
opinion
saying
that
this
is
just
advisory
language
and
that
the
power
company
is
not
bound
by
them
in
any
respect?
justice
kennedy
well,
can't
we
discuss
the
case
as
if
this
is
a
binding
requirement?
i...
because
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
that
you
still
prevail.
justice
kennedy
well,
has
ferc
taken
a
position
as
to
the
meaning
of
"subject
matter"
in
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
was
this
a
position
taken
by
ferc
in
a
brief
in
an
adjudicatory
matter,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
does
chevron
deference
apply
to
such
matters,
or
does
chevron
deference
just
apply
to
rule
making?
justice
kennedy
and
that
we
held
that
chevron
deference
is
to
be
given
to
agency
positions
taken
in
the
course
of
litigation
in
an
adjudicated
matter,
not
rule
making.
justice
kennedy
is
that
cardoza
fonseca...
what
is
our
holding?
do
you
have
authority
for
that?
justice
kennedy
they
were
rule
making.
justice
kennedy
whether
or
not...
whether
or
not
it
conflicts?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
that's
field
preemption.
that's
field
preemption,
now
you're
back
to--
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
enforcement
consequence
of
a
violation?
justice
kennedy
the
mandatory
injunction
to
reconform
your
pricing
scheme,
or
divestiture
of
shares?
i
mean,
how--
