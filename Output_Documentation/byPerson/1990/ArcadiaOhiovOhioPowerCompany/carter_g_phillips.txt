mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
are
15
small
villages
and
towns
in
ohio
that
purchase
electricity
from
the
ohio
power
company
for
the
purpose
of
reselling
it
to
their
residents.
ohio
power
is
an
electric
utility
company
that
sells
electricity
at
wholesale,
and
is
part
of
a
public
utility
holding
system
called
the
american
electric
power
company.
that
company
is
registered
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
ohio
power
is
subject
to
regulation
by
both
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
and
the
securities
exchange
commission.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
division
of
regulatory
authority
specified
in
section
318
of
the
federal
power
act
between
these
two
agencies
in
connection
with
ohio
power's
wholesale
electric
rates.
the
rates
ohio
power
charges
to
petitioners
are
significantly
affected
by
the
cost
of
coal.
coal
represents
approximately
50
percent
of
the
total
cost
of
the
production
of
electricity
by
the
ohio
power
company.
the
issue
in
this
case
arises
because
ohio
power
does
not
purchase
its
coal
on
the
open
market,
but
rather
it
purchases
most
of
its
coal
from
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
called
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
between
1971
and
1980
ohio
power
went
to
the
securities
exchange
commission
and
asked
for
four
separate
orders
with
respect
to
the
coal
mined
by
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
the
first
one
provided
essentially
for
the
creation
of
the
coal
mining
operation
and
asked
for
securities
to
be
issued
for
that
purpose.
the
second
one
followed
up
by
an
additional
grant
of
securities
in
order
to
provide
an
actual
operating
opportunity
for
that
coal
company.
and
the
last
two
orders
also
provided
for
the
issuance
of
securities
in
order
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
the
mining
operations
by
that
coal
company.
nothing
in
those
orders
specifically
refers
to
the
ohio
power
and
southern
ohio
coal
company
and
the
sale
of
coal.
they
simply
refer
generally
to
these
basic
transactions
under
a
host
of
provisions
of
the
security...
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
but
not
section
13(b)
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
which
is
the
provision
that
specifically
regulates
these
kinds
of
inter-affiliate
coal
transactions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
the
extent
it
applies
at
all,
it
would...
it
would
clearly
be
just
a
ceiling.
but
what
it
seems
to
me
clearly,
what
i
think
is
in
fact
the
case
is
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
how
it
has
to
be
purchased.
what
it
does
is
recite
an
intention
by
ohio
power
essentially
to
comply
with
an
unstated
section
13(b),
whatever
section
13(b)
requires.
the
way
i
would
read
the
order,
it
simply
says
we
will
comply
with
the
federal
standards.
since
those
standards
incorporate
a
market
basis
under
rule
92,
they
could
just
as
easily
be
saying
that
we
will
comply
with
that
requirement,
whatever
it
happens
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
believe
that
they
necessarily...
i
mean,
at
some
point
they
set
a
ceiling
in
the
sense
that
you
cannot
exceed
either
cost
or
the
market
price.
but
i
don't
think
they
were
designed
to
say
anything
about
what
ohio
power
is
required
to
do
with
respect
to
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
any
requirements
in
those
orders,
given
that
there
is
nothing
that
specifically
says
anything
about
ohio
power
buying
coal
from
southern
ohio,
how
much,
at
what
prices.
it
only
says
that
southern
ohio
will
sell
to
the
american
electric
power
system.
it
doesn't
even
specify
ohio
power
in
connection
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
court
of
appeals
was
able
to
avoid
having
to
construe
the
order,
because
it
held
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
there
was
a
conflict
between
the...
its...
the
sec
regulation
and
ferc
regulation.
what
it
said
was
this
is
a
matter
subject
to
regulation
by
the
sec
under
section
13(b).
and
the
way
they
construed
section
318
meant
that
ferc
was
ousted
of
its
otherwise
appropriate
regulatory
authority.
so
they
didn't
have
to
construe
those
orders.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
white,
absolutely
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
but
except
for
precisely
the
opposite
reason,
which
is
that
i
don't
care
because
it
is
clear
to
me
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
what
the
ferc
has
done
here
and
what
the
sec
has
done
here,
and
therefore
it
should
make
no
difference
how
the
sec's
orders
are
characterized.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
want
to...
they
would
be
reviewing
to
assess
the
relationships
between
the
southern
ohio
coal
company
and
the
ohio
power
company
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
are
no
dealings
going
on
beyond
whatever
representations
are
being
made
in
connection
with
these
orders.
i
mean,
they
have
investment
regulation
to
take
into
account,
and
so
they
have
a
quite
reasonable...
they
might,
potentially
at
least,
want
to
exercise
their
authority
to
promote
those
purposes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
could
be...
in
this
setting
they
could
be
looking
out
for
debt
holders
or
preferred
shareholders
of
ohio
power
company,
or
debt...
anybody
who
might
have
debt
with
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
in
general
they
are
supposed
to
look
out
for
them.
on
the
other
hand,
my
understanding
of
what
the
sec's
authority
and
mandate
is
is
to
make
sure
that
the
transactions
among
affiliates
within
a
public
utility
holding
company
system
are...
are
handled
in
a
way
that
the
public
is
informed
as
to
the
operations,
and
that
no
one
is
injured,
either
the
public
interest
or
individual
companies
within
that
system.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
of
the
american
electric
power
system,
no
question
about
that.
but
nothing
in
what
the
ferc
provides
here
interferes
with
ohio
power's
ability
to
purchase
any
amount
of
coal
it
wants
from
southern
ohio.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
the
sec
approved
four
separate
securities
transactions
that
don't
say
anything
about
the
sale
of
coal
between
ohio
power
and
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
with
respect
to
those
contracts,
those
contracts
were
not
put
before
the
sec
for
review,
and
they
have
never
been
approved
by
the
sec.
all
it
said
was
we
will
allow
ohio
power
to
invest
essentially
in
these
coal
companies
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
have
available
supplies.
now,
in
the
process
of
saying
that
they
did
indicate,
the
sec
indicated,
that
it
was
the
intention
of
ohio
power
to
purchase...
or
not
even
ohio
power,
the
aep
system,
to
purchase
its
coal,
because
that
would
guarantee
a
reliable
supply.
but
it
says
nothing
about
the
specific
cost
that
would
be
incorporated
into
that
arrangement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
specific
language
of
the
order
doesn't
refer
to
ohio
power.
it
refers
to
the
american
electric
system,
frankly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
it
does
say
that,
justice
white.
the
problem
with...
with
making
much
of
that
as
far
as
a
requirement
in
any
sense
to
be
applied
against
ohio
power
in
the
context
of
a
ferc
rate-making
proceeding
is
that
that
is
precisely
the
same
language
that
exists
in
section
13(b),
is
that
coal
or
these
goods
have
to
be
sold
at
cost.
and
since
the
first
day
that
that
statute
was
enacted,
the
sec
has
had
a
regulation
on
the
books
that
restricted
the
sale
of
coal
or
any
other
goods
among
interaffiliate
companies
to
the
market
price.
so
by
referencing
language
of
cost,
that
doesn't
necessarily
say
anything
about
what
is
required
in
the
relationship
between
ohio
power
and
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
terms
of
what
the
charges
are?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
have
guessed
that
it
might
have
been
a
risky
venture,
frankly,
to
try
that.
on
the
other
hand,
rule
92
states
unmistakably
that
you
are
supposed
to,
that
you
have
a
market
basis.
and
therefore
i
think
they
could
have
at
least
gone
to
the
sec
and
said
despite
these
recitals
in
the
order
what
we
really
want
to
do
is
to
be
able
to
sell
it
at
market
price,
and
be
able
to
do
that.
i
think
they
are
still
free
to
go
to
the
sec
and
seek
that
kind
of
approval.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
the
one
who
says
cost
means
market.
the
sec
has
since
the
first
day
said
cost
means
market,
or
at
least
the
restriction
based
on
cost
in
section
13(b)
is
fully
satisfied
by
a
market
price
standard
within
rule
92.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
what
does...
but
see,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
section
13(b)
doesn't
say
things
have
to
follow
at
cost.
what
section
13(b)
says
is
you
cannot
have
an
interaffiliate
contract,
period,
unless
you
satisfy
certain
requirements
of
the
sec.
and
one
of
those
requirements
is
language
that
says
at
cost
economically
and
efficiently
allocated
among
the
various
parties.
so
it
is
not
a
strict
at-cost
standard
such
that
congress
said
in
13(b)
this
is
how
you
have
to
operate
in
terms
of
interaffiliate
contracts.
it's
a
delegation
of
authority
to
the
securities
exchange
commission,
and
it
has
exercised
its
authority
in
a
way
that
in
no
way
undermines
what
went
on
here.
i
think
it's
important
to
step
back
for
a
second,
because
the
truth
is
whatever
the
sec
has
said
about
how
ohio
power
and
the
southern
ohio
coal
companies
should
entertain
the
idea
of
selling
the
coal
between
themselves,
that
is
nevertheless
fundamentally
different
from
the
question
of
how
much
the
ohio
power
company
can
charge
its
rate
payers.
and
that
is
really
the
essence
of
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case
under
section
318.
the
question
here
is
is
there
a
conflict
between
those
two
provisions.
and
the
reason
we
need
to
get
to
that
analysis
is
because
i
think
we
can
all
agree,
or
should
all
at
least
agree
that
the
d.c.
circuit
erred
in
its
construction
of
section
318,
which
says
that
simply
because
this
is
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sec
under
section
13(b),
that
for
that
reason
alone
ferc
is
ousted
of
its
important
rate-making
authority
over
a
component
of
cost
that
represents
essentially
50
percent
of
the
rates
that
get
charged
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
what
the...
what
we
know
from
both
the
sec
and
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
is
that
they
are
in
complete
agreement
with
the
petitioners
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
over
broadly
construing
the
restrictions
on
section...
in
section
318.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
you
take
the
combination
of
the
statutory
language,
the
structure
of
the
act,
and
the
regulatory
history
under
the
act
it
is
not
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute,
because...
and
also
it
represents
an
incredibly
malleable
interpretation
of
the
term
"subject
matter".
and
to
a
certain
extent
both
the
ferc
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
and
certainly
ohio
power,
is
subject
to
some
criticism
for
their
handling
of
what
the
term
"subject
matter"
means.
the
court
of
appeals
criticized
ferc
for
saying,
well,
this
is
rate
making,
and
therefore...
and
the
sec
doesn't
engage
in
rate
making
and
therefore
it
must
be
a
different
subject
matter.
i
think
that
is
an
overbroad
analysis
of
the
question.
i
think
that
there
are
certain...
it
is
certainly
possible
that
the
sec
could
enter
an
order
that
might
affect
rate
making
directly
by
a
requirement
that
could
trigger
section
318.
on
the
other
hand,
it
certainly
doesn't
follow
what
ohio
power
argues
here,
which
is
to
say
we
all
agree
on
what
the
subject
matter
here
is.
it's
the
interaffiliate
coal
transaction,
and
therefore
we
have
separate
requirements
regarding
that.
the
point
here
is
that
there
is
no
obvious
definition
of
the
term
"subject
matter".
so
what
you
need
to
do
is
step
back
and
see
what
is
it
you
are
trying
to
get
at
under
the
statute
by
that
language.
and
what
you
are
trying
to
get
at
by
that
language
is
you
have
one
requirement
imposed
by
one
agency,
another
requirement
imposed
by
a
separate
agency.
they
must
be
on
the
same
person
and
the
same
subject
matter.
and
the
consequence
is
that
only
one
requirement
is
then
ousted.
i
take
that
to
be
precisely
the
language
of
conflict.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
restrict
the
scope
of
the
possible
conflicts
to
the
identified
subject
matters
that
are
placed
within
that
provision
regarding
securities
issuances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
define
subject
matter
in
the
abstract,
and
the
sec
and
ferc
agree
with
that.
they...
they
frankly
admit
that
subject
matter
is
not
a
term
that
you
can
simply
say
this
is
what
it
means.
presumably,
what
i
think
it
means
is
any
situation
where
both...
where
both
agencies
impose
irreconcilable
obligations.
because
when
you
have
got
irreconcilable
obligations
imposed,
it
is
clear
then
that
they
are
involved
in
the
same
subject
matter
by
definition.
and
the
reason
why
you
do
it
that
way--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that's...
the
reason
it's
a
narrow
definition
is
that
that
is
the
approach
that
best
effectuates
congress'
purpose.
congress
did
not
intend
for
this
to
be
a
situation
where
the
ferc
and
the
sec
would
continue
to
collide
with
each
other.
what
the
congress
intended
was
that
they
would
largely
operate
in
their
respective
spheres,
and
there
would
be
very
few
conflicts.
and
our
interpretation
directly
promotes
that
purpose,
and
thereby
ensures
that
public
utility
holding
companies
are
in
all
circumstances
subject
to
direct
and
comprehensive
regulation
by
at
least
one
agency.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
justice
scalia,
they
did
not
approve
any
contracts.
what
they
approved
were
requests
to
enter
into
securities
transactions.
and
the
reason
that
they
approved
those
securities
transactions
was
because
they
thought
that
ohio
power
engaged...
would
be
well
served
by
having
access
to
coal,
by
having
ready
access
to
coal
through
an
affiliate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
they
never...
they
were
never
required
to
bring
the
contracts
to
the
sec.
they
have
never
been
submitted
to
them,
and
they
have
never
been
approved
by
the
sec.
the
orders
under
review
are
the
orders
that
are
cited
by
ohio
power,
are
all
securities
transactions
that
have
been
approved,
that
contain
some
recitals
about
other
contracts.
but
the
specific
contract
under
which
ohio
power
and
the
southern
ohio
coal
company
operate
are
not
at
issue
here,
or
have
not
been
approved
by
the
sec
at
least.
if
the
court
has
no
questions
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
in
evaluating
the
case
as
it
comes
to
the
court
at
this
point
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
initially
that
the
ferc
here
is
attempting
to
protect
the
consumers
by
the
rates
that
it
allows
to
be
charged
and
the
charges
that
it
allows
ohio
power
to
pass
through.
and
that
that
exercise
of
authority
should
only
be
set
aside
in
the
most
unmistakable...
if
supported
by
the
most
unmistakable
terms.
we
turn
first
to
section
13(b).
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
tell
whether
ohio
power
believes
section
13(b)
ousts
the
ferc
of
its
authority,
but
the
sec
has
clearly
said
that
it
does
not,
and
the
sec's
rule
clearly
says
that
it
does
not.
and
notwithstanding
mr.
berlin's
comment
to
the
contrary,
rule
92
does
not
set
up
an
exemption.
rule
92,
if
you
read
the
sec
and
ferc's...
or,
excuse
me,
the
ferc's
reply
brief,
says
that
the
price
is
"not
limited
to
cost"
when
you
are
talking
about
interaffiliate
sales.
so
rule
92
provides
no
mechanism
for
doing
away
with
the
ferc's
effort
here.
so
the
only
question
then
are
these
four
orders.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
as
to
what
those
four
orders
mean,
but
i
submit
to
you
the
court
is
not
obliged
to
have
to
worry
about
the
specific
meaning
of
those
four
orders,
because
i
am
prepared
to
give
mr.
berlin
the
fuller...
the
fullest
reading
of
those
orders,
which
is
really
what
they
want
here,
is
for
ohio
power
to
pay
a
certain
price
for
the
coal
that
it
purchases
from
the
southern
ohio
coal
company.
even
given
that
interpretation,
which
is
the
broadest
available
and
the
broadest
they've
asserted,
it
still
remains
available
for
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
step
in
and
say
but
we
do
not
permit
you
to
charge
that
amount
in
the
rates
that
you
set
for
electricity.
why?
because
these
are
not
irreconcilable
conflicts
in
the
obligations
of
the
ohio
power
company
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
says
nothing
about
what
the
ferc
was
going
to
ultimately
do
with
respect
to
those.
and
again
here
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
argument
that
somehow
because
of
the
ferc
order
that
that
has
in
some
way
frustrated
the
sec's
purpose.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
is
not
the
appropriate
conflict
analysis,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
if
it
turns
out
that
it
would
require
the
rates
to
be
set
at
unjust
and
unreasonable
levels,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
congress
would
have
intended
that.
mr.
berlin
complains
that
this
was
a
statute
not
designed
to
provide
too
much
regulation.
i
submit
to
you
it's
a
statute
designed
to
provide
just
the
right
amount.
