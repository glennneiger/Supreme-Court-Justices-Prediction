mr.
edward
berlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
indeed
a
case
of
statutory
construction,
but
before
i
get
to
the
statute,
which
has
been
avoided
thus
far
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
take
up
two
questions
that
the
court
asked.
justice
kennedy,
chevron
applies
to
the
reasoned
decision
making
of
the
agency.
it
does
not
apply,
and
this
court
has
never
applied
it,
to
the
reformulation
of
that
position
by
appellant
counsel.
and
justice
stevens,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
sec
does
not
believe
that
the
orders
are
not
in
conflict.
the
sec
joined
in
the
brief
before
this
court,
but
the
only
time
the
sec
has
spoken
to
the
conflict
question
was
when
sherman
shad
of
the
sec
testified
before
congress
in
1982
when
he
was
urging
an
appeal
of
the
holding
company
act.
and
he
pointed
out
that
section
318
was
there
to
prevent
overlapping
jurisdiction,
and
that
in
point
of
fact
when
it
comes
to
affiliate
transactions
the
sec
applies
a
different
price
standard
than
the
ferc
applies
to
utilities
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
so
the
only
time
the
sec
had
occasion
to
speak
to
the
compatibility
of
these
different
regulatory
requirements
it
disagreed
with
the
representation
that
was
offered
a
few
moments
ago.
mr.
edward
berlin
it
was
speaking
to
the
fact
that--
mr.
edward
berlin
--just
a
few
months
before,
justice
stevens,
the
ferc,
which
itself
from
1935
until
november
1981
applied
a
cost
standard
to
affiliate
transactions,
in
november
1981
it
decided
to
apply
a
market
standard.
mr.
edward
berlin
the
price
should
be
at
cost.
it
couldn't
be
below
cost,
because
that
would
be
confiscatory--
mr.
edward
berlin
--the
ferc--
mr.
edward
berlin
--the
ferc
had
never
introduced
the
concept
of
market
until
november
of
19--
mr.
edward
berlin
--that
is
correct.
that
was--
mr.
edward
berlin
--it
has...
it
has
not.
it
addressed
the
fact
that
different
principles
were
articulated
as
governing.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
correct.
but
if
i
can,
let
me
get--
mr.
edward
berlin
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
berlin
the
sec
most
certainly
does
have
a
rule
on
the
books.
its
rule
is
that
affiliate
transactions
shall
not
be
above
cost
except
where
the
sec
grants
an
exemption
from
the
at-cost
limitation.
this
case,
boiled
down
to
its
bare
essentials,
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
section--
mr.
edward
berlin
--certainly.
mr.
edward
berlin
it
most
certainly
would.
mr.
edward
berlin
the
sec
applies
a
cost
standard--
mr.
edward
berlin
--unless
it
grants
an
exemption.
it
has
never,
except
for
one
instance
in
1937--
mr.
edward
berlin
--it
shall
not
be
other
than
cost
unless
it
grants
an
exemption.
under
the
sec's
rules
there
are
two
regimes,
a
cost
regime
and
a
market
regime.
mr.
edward
berlin
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
let
me...
let
me
tell
you
why.
first...
i
think
it
clear
we
should
put
this
aside.
section
318
asks
two
questions.
it
asks
first
what
is
the
subject
matter
that
each
agency
seeks
to
regulate,
and
has
the
sec
imposed
a
requirement.
there
is
no
dispute,
there
can
be
no
dispute
before
you
that
the
subject
matter
that
each
agency
seeks
to
regulate
is
in
fact
the
same.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
each
agency
is
seeking
to
determine
the
price
that
ohio
power
reasonably
should
have
paid
for
the
coal
that
it
purchased
from
its
affiliate.
that
was
the
essential
holding
of
the
ferc.
yet
before
you
no
one
seeks
to
justify,
to
defend
that
subject
matter
rationale.
it
was
the
essential
rationale,
justice
stevens,
of
the
ferc
for
a
very
good
reason.
admittedly,
the
ferc
express
some
confusion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
sec
was
imposing
cost
in
all
cases
or
only
cost
as
a
ceiling.
i
think,
by
the
way,
that
it
was
imposing
cost
in
all
cases,
and
i
will
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment.
but
what
the
ferc
was
saying,
it
said
we
assume
that
it
was
cost
as
a
ceiling,
and
it
happened
to
be
the
case
that
at
the
time
the
ferc
issued
its
order,
market
price
was
below
cost.
hence
it
said
there's
no
irreconcilability.
but
the
ferc
went
on
to
explain
the
rationale
of
its
market
decision,
and
it
said
very
clearly,
you
can
find
this
on
page
63a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
it
said
under
all
rationale
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
ohio
power
be
able
to
charge
market,
irrespective
of
its
relationship
to
cost.
that
ohio
power
be
required
to
charge
market
even
when
it
exceeds
cost.
that
was
the
essential
underpinning
of
the
ferc's
holding.
so
even
if
you
believe
that
the
sec
set
cost
merely
as
a
limit,
it
clearly
is
the
case
that
ferc
says
ohio
power
must
be
allowed,
if
it
its
rule
is
to
have
any
vitality,
must
be
allowed
to
pierce
that
limit
when
market
exceeds
cost.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
believe
it
was
the
rationale,
justice
scalia,
used
as
a
supplement
by
the
court
below.
but
let
me
point
out
it
was
also
not
the
rationale
used
by
the
ferc,
because
it
could
not.
the
ferc
recognized
that
if
it
was
allowing
cost
to
gravitate
to
market,
when
cost
under
the
sec's
order
was
a
limitation,
it
recognized
that
there
was
an
obvious
irreconcilability.
ohio
power
said
the
effect
of
your
pronouncement,
ferc,
and
the
sec's
prescription
is
to
constrain
us
to
the
lower
of
cost
or
market.
the
ferc
said
no,
you
misconstrued.
we
are
allowing
you
to
charge
market
in
any
case,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
different
subject
matter.
mr.
edward
berlin
first,
let
me
suggest
that
while
they
could
have
been
written
a
bit
more
clearly,
unquestionably
the
first
order
that
initiated
this
whole
enterprise
said
it
should
be
based
on
amount
equal
to
actual
cost.
and
then
the
subsequent
orders
said
it
shall
not
exceed
cost--
mr.
edward
berlin
--i'm
sorry,
chief
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it's
very
clear
why
13(b)
is
in
the
statute
and
why
the
sec
issued
its
orders
under
13(b).
13(b)
was
put
into
the
statute
although
congress
knew
that
the
ferc
was
to
be
the
agency
that
ultimately
was
to
prescribe
rates.
in
13(b)
congress
intended
to
affect
how
rates
were
set.
the
whole
purpose
of
13(b)
is
to
affect
the
transfer
price
paid
in
an
affiliate
transaction.
13(b),
i
suggest
to
you
very
respectfully,
is
robbed
of
all
meaning
unless
it
is
intended
to
affect
rates.
mr.
edward
berlin
under
the
holding
company
act,
you
cannot
go
forward
with
an
affiliate
transaction,
wholly
apart
from
13(b),
without
getting
a
whole
host
of
authorizations
from
the
sec.
mr.
edward
berlin
the
reason
it
is
interested
in
this
particular
price
is
because
when
the
holding
company
act
was
being
considered
by
congress,
one
of
the
evils
that
was
basic
to
congressional
concern
was
the
fact
that
it
was
perceived
that,
as
a
consequence
of
interaffiliate
transactions,
inflated
prices
were
being
passed
along
to
the
utility
purchaser
within
the
holding
company
system.
congress...
and
this
portion
of
legislative
history
is
conceded
by
everyone
in
this
case...
congress
was
concerned
about
the
effect
on
rates
of
affiliate
transactions,
and
it
gave...
it
made
two
basic
policy
choices
in
the
holding
company
act.
it
first
gave
jurisdictional
responsibility
to
deal
with
that
concern
to
the
sec.
and
then
in
a
very
unusual
step
it
didn't
think
to
establish
a
broad
regulatory
standard.
it
said
in
exercising
that
responsibility,
sec,
we
want
you
to
apply
an
at-cost
standard.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
was
prescribed
by
congress
precisely
because
it
recognized
that
affiliate
transactions
affect
rates,
and
congress
wanted
the
sec
to
police
them
and
to--
mr.
edward
berlin
--i
think
not,
justice
stevens.
as
the
petitioners
correctly
point
out
in
their
brief,
the
holding
company
act
had
two
objectives.
clearly
a
consumer
protection--
mr.
edward
berlin
--it
also
had
an
investment
protection
objective.
and
if,
if
it
is
in
fact
the
case
that
as
the
result
of
the
collision
of
these
two
requirements
ohio
power
company
will
be
constrained
to
the
lower
of
cost
or
market,
then
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
investors
that
petitioners
correctly
point
out
were
also
a
concern
of
congress,
are
left
exceedingly
naked.
mr.
edward
berlin
the
purpose
of
this
order
was
to
balance,
was
to
balance
the
dual
concern
that
congress
had
for
both
consumers
and
investors.
mr.
edward
berlin
in
the
final...
in
the
final
analysis,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
edward
berlin
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
edward
berlin
it
was
to
protect
both
the
investors
in
ohio
power
company,
namely
american
electric
power,
and
the
consumers
of
the
operating
utility,
ohio
power.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
even
though
the
ferc
may
say
that
cost
is
x,
it
doesn't
change
one
iota
the
costs
that
are
actually
incurred
by
the
holding
company.
and
if
the
x
established
by
the
ferc
is
below
the
actual
cost,
then
i
suggest
to
you
there
is
a
trapping
of
costs,
and
that
trapping
of
costs
unnecessarily
adversely
impacts
on
investors.
and
i
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
in
fact
as
a
product
of
this
case
affiliates
of
holding
companies
are
told
that
they
are
going
to
be
constrained
to
the
lower
of
cost
of
market,
which
means
that
they
only
have
a
potential
for
losing,
and
at
best
for
holding
themselves
even,
you
will
not
see
holding
companies
go
into
affiliate
relationships--
mr.
edward
berlin
--that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
that
particular
instance
the
sec
has
certainly
used
its
province,
said
that
while
we
are
going
to
specify
and
police
most
of
the
costs,
we
are
going
to
delegate
to
the
ferc,
as
it
is
permitted
to
do
under
318,
the
responsibility
for
setting
the
return.
and
interestingly,
what
it
said
was
the
return
on
this
transaction
is
to
be
constricted
by
the
regulated
utility
return,
a
concept--
mr.
edward
berlin
--no
greater
than
the
return
allowed
by
the
ferc.
but
that
is
an
instance
in
which
the
sec
recognized
that
it
had
to
permit,
that
it
had
to
open
up
an
area
of
jurisdiction
if
the
ferc
was
to
be
allowed
to
go
forward,
and
it
did
so
explicitly.
no
matter
how
you
view
the
sec's
order,
justice
stevens,
whether
you
view
it
as
setting
a
cap
or
merely
as
setting
cost,
that
is
cost,
no
more,
no
less,
i
think
it's
the
latter.
because
i
think
that's
what
section
13(b)
is
talking
about.
i
think
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
harmonize
the
interests
of
consumers
and
of
rate
payers.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
believe
that
is
right,
justice.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
there
was
a
question
about
the
court
of
appeals'
dealing
with
this
matter.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
paid
total
allegiance
to
section
318.
it
followed
the
prescription
of
318
precisely.
it
said
what
is
the
subject
matter
that
each
agency
is
seeking
to
regulate,
and
i
think
the
subject
matter
is
fairly
clear.
it's
the
regulated
activity.
that
is
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
congress
wanted
to
allow
these
transactions
to
go
forward,
and
it
recognized
that
if
there
was
an
inevitable
clash
of
two
regulators
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter,
the
same
regulated
activity,
frustration
could
take
place.
so
318
is
intended
to
preclude
that
frustration.
mr.
edward
berlin
justice
scalia,
if
i
have
given
the
impression
that
i
believe
field
preemption
is
appropriate,
then
i
have
misspoken.
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
field
preemption
case.
my
reaction
was
to
petitioners'
quotation
of
physical
impossibility
cases.
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
field
preemption
situation--
mr.
edward
berlin
--no.
i
believe
it's
a
question
of
how
one
defines
the
field.
if
you
define
field
preemption
to
mean
that
once
the
sec
has
spoken
it
has
occupied
the
field
to
the
total
exclusion
of
the
ferc,
that
is
not
what
i
am
saying.
that
is
not
what
318
says.
mr.
edward
berlin
what
i
mean
is
what
i
think
flows
out
of
318,
that
if
with
respect
to
a
subject
matter
the
sec
has
imposed
a
requirement,
then
ferc
may
not
impose
a
requirement
with
respect
to
that
subject
matter.
now
the
issue,
of
course--
mr.
edward
berlin
--whether
or
not
it
conflicts,
although
i
believe
in
this
case,
as
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
discuss,
the
conflict
is
inevitable.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
can,
i
believe,
visualize
a
situation
where
the
ferc
would
believe
that
it
could
supplement
the
requirement
imposed
with
respect
to
a
particular
regulated
activity
that
would
not,
in
its
judgment,
result
in
conflict.
mr.
edward
berlin
and
i
would
say
that
that
is
no
good
under
318.
but
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
berlin
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
what
the
legislative
history
tells
me
is
congress
recognized
that
it
was
setting
up
two
regulatory
regimes,
each
of
which
were
going
to
speak
to
the
same
companies.
and
it
recognized
that
if
it
did
not
do
something
to
sharply
divide
jurisdiction,
that
you
could
have
a
stalemate.
mr.
edward
berlin
but
for
the
fact
that
your
example
is
covered
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
and
the
issue
of
accounting
is
one
where
the
ferc
is
given--
mr.
edward
berlin
--if
you
can
construct
a
situation
where
the
se...
where
the
ferc
can
supplement,
without
being
in
conflict,
then
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
yes,
there
would
be
supremacy
in
favor
of
the
sec.
and
i
come
to
that
because
i
honestly
believe
from
looking
at
the
legislative
history
that
congress
recognized
in
1935
that
while
it
was
imposing
a
regulatory
regime,
there
could
well
be
instances
where
too
much
regulation
would
stifle
the
objectives
of
congress.
therefore
it
said
where
the
subject
matter
is
the
same
and
the
sec
has
spoken,
the
ferc
should
not.
i
believe
that
subject
matter
is
most
clearly
and
easily
understood
to
be
a
regulated
activity.
mr.
edward
berlin
it
probably
is
the
case,
and
perhaps
i
am
biting
off
more
than
i
need
chew,
that
anytime
the
sec,
the
ferc
imposes
a
requirement
that
is
different
than
the
requirement
imposed
by
the
sec,
there
will
be
a
conflict.
and
indeed,
if
the
ferc
imposes
exactly
the
same
requirement,
i
am
not
sure
anyone
would
care.
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
section
318,
justice
scalia,
you
will
not
find
any
support
for
the
notion
that
it
is
addressing
conflicts
of
requirements.
the
word
conflict
does
not
appear
in
the
text
of
318.
it
appears
in
the
heading,
but
the
heading
talks
about
conflicts
of
jurisdiction.
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
legislative
history
you
find
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
overlapping
jurisdiction.
it
did
not
want
to
frustrate
actions
by
regulated
entities
by
having
too
many
regulators
dealing
with
the
same
activity.
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
in
this
case
the
court
need
not
go
that
far
in
reading
section
318,
because
no
matter
how
you
construe
the
sec's
order,
whether
you
construe
it
as
establishing
that
the
price
must
always
be
at
cost
and
no
more
and
no
less,
or
simply
as
a
cost
ceiling,
one
thing
is
clear
and
has
never
been
suggested
to
the
contrary.
the
sec
has
not
imposed
a
market
standard.
it
has
never
imposed
a
market
standard
on
any
affiliate
transaction
since
a
single
case
in
1937.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
think
not
for
two
reasons,
justice
stevens.
first,
the
essential
rationale
of
the
ferc's
holding
was
that
we
must
allow
ohio
power
to
charge
market,
even
when
market
is
above
cost.
that
rationale
was
offered
in
a
response
to
a
contention
by
ohio
power
that
if
it
were
constrained
to
the
lower
of
cost
or
market--
mr.
edward
berlin
--as
in
fact
it
did
on
at
least
two
occasions
before
the
ferc
issued
its
final
order
in
this
case.
and
we
also
must
keep
in
mind,
justice
stevens,
that
what
the
ferc
did--
mr.
edward
berlin
--no.
they
are
referenced
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief.
what
the
ferc
did,
justice
stevens,
in
carrying
out
its
rationale
was
to
direct
ohio
power
company
to
modify
its
fuel
adjustment
clause
to
provide
for
the
automatic
pass-through
of
market
prices,
irrespective
of
their
relationship
to
cost.
and
in
fact
in
the
public
service
of
new
mexico
case,
where
the
ferc
in
november
of
1981
abandoned
its
adherence
to
cost-based
regulation
and
first
adopted
a
market
approach,
in
fact
in
that
case
the
ferc
was
allowing
market
prices
in
excess
of
cost.
mr.
edward
berlin
the
sec
in
fact
has
stated
on
two
occasions...
the
staff
of
the
sec,
in
filing
comments
in
another
affiliate
transaction
case
before
the
ferc,
where
the
staff
recommended--
mr.
edward
berlin
--well,
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
the
ferc
has
a
veto
simply
because
it
has
the
opportunity
to
speak
last.
mr.
edward
berlin
whether
the
ferc
in
effect
can
put
the
sec
to
the
burden
of
justifying
its
decision.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
suggest
one
that
has
to
also
get
back
to
13(b),
and
to--
mr.
edward
berlin
--i
think
not,
justice
stevens--
mr.
edward
berlin
--i
think
not,
justice
stevens.
there
is
a
conflict
even
when
market
is
below
cost,
because
costs
are
tracked.
ohio
power
company--
mr.
edward
berlin
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
we
do
not
have
the
option
to
do
anything
other
than
what
the
sec
prescribed
when
it
gave
us
the
authorization
to
enter
into
these
transactions.
it
is
in
fact
the
case
that
the
sec
did
not
explicitly
approve
the
contract,
but
it
set
out
the
requirements
that
we
were
obliged
and
directed
to
include
in
the
contract.
mr.
edward
berlin
presumably
the
sec
can
bring
enforcement
action
against
ohio
power
and
southern
ohio
for
violating
the
only
condition
upon
which
the
sec
determined
that
it
was
appropriate
to
allow
this
affiliate
transaction
to
go
forward.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
think
it
would
be
the
former,
justice
kennedy.
you
should
also
keep
in
mind
that
under
the
holding
company
act
congress
was
not
desirous
of
stimulating
holding
companies'
entries
into
unregulated
activities.
it
was
very
cautious.
it
provided
that
you
can
only
engage
in
those
activities
that
are
reasonably
necessary,
economically
necessary
to
your
utility
operations,
that
it
mandated
the
sec
to
enforce
that.
i
want
to
say
one
final
word
about
regulatory
gap,
because
although
it
hasn't
been
mentioned
today,
much
has
been
made
of
it
in
the
briefs.
there
is
a
parade
of
horrors
suggested
to
you
that
if
you
allow
the
sec
order
to
stand,
if
you
over...
it
you
allow...
if
you
overturn
the
ferc's
order,
allow
the
court
of
appeals
to
stand,
that
there
will
be
a
regulatory
gap.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
under
the
very
proper
reading
of
219
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
can
be
no
regulatory
gap.
if
the
sec
has
not
imposed
a
requirement
with
respect
to
a
subject
matter,
if
it
itself
has
not
filled
the
regulatory
gap--
mr.
edward
berlin
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
