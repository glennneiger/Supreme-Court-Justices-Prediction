mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question,
the
statutory
question
before
the
court
involves
the
proper
reconciliation
of
two
different
levels
of
overlap
and
duplication.
on
one
level
there
is
the
problem
of
the
imposition
of
duplicative
and
possibly
conflicting
requirements
on
particular
regulated
entities.
but
on
the
second
level,
there
is
the
problem
of
the
extent
to
which
the
sec
is
to
be
called
upon
to
provide
the
full
panoply
of
rate
regulatory
functions
and
expertise
for
holding
company
affiliates
that
ferc
otherwise
provides
if
those
functions
are
to
be
provided
at
all
in
the
context
of
holding
company
affiliates.
and
the
basic
concern
of
the
two
federal
agencies
before
the
court
today
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
section
318
of
the
federal
power
act
in
a
manner
that
goes
too
far
in
eliminating
overlap
and
the
mere
possibility
of
conflict
on
the
first
level.
and
the
necessary
effect
of
that
interpretation
is
to
require
impractical
duplication
of
mission
by
the
sec
and
ferc
on
the
second
level,
because
ferc
will
be
disabled--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't...
i...
i
can't
say
that
i
agree
with
the
entire
argument.
i
agree
that
the
argument
is
a
possible
outcome.
those
orders
have
not
to
this
point
been
interpreted
by
either
the
sec
or
any
court,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
orders
don't
speak
to
sales
as
such.
they...
they
approve
the
securities
transactions.
the
orders
all
appear
in
full
in
the
joint
appendix,
beginning
at
page
76,
the
series
of
four
orders.
and
if
you
look
at
them
you
will
see
that
they
consist
of
a
descriptive
recitation
of
the
application
for
the
securities
transaction,
which
includes
in
one
case
the
words
that
the
sales
will
be
at
cost,
and
in
the
others
at
no
more
than
cost.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
anticipated
future
contracts
are
being
described
in
this
recitation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that's
one
possible
reading
of
them.
this
is
what
requires
interpretation
of
what
was
meant
by
then
the
paragraph
at
the
end
in
which
the
sec
says
that
these
applications
are
approved,
after
reciting
the
terms
of
the
application.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief
we
do
not
think
that
question
should
be
addressed
initially
by
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
unnecessary
to
address
the
meaning
of
these
sec
orders,
because
of
its,
in
our
view,
misinterpretation
of
section
318
of
the
federal
power
act
on
which
it
based
its
entire
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
position
would
be
that
we
would
still
prevail.
these...
the
question
is
how
should
these
orders
be
read
in
light
of
the
two
sec
rules
that
are
relevant,
when
the
orders
themselves
did
not
refer
to
section
13(b)
or
purport
to
be
exercising
the
sec's
authority
under
section
13(b)
to
govern
and
regulate
transactions
between
affiliated
companies.
i
mean,
it
would
be
possible
to
read
the
orders
as
merely
a
prediction
of
how
the
application
of
rule
92
would
result
in
these
sales.
there
are
various
contentions
that
could
be
made
about
the
reading
of
these
orders.
the
commission
has
not
to
this
date
had
occasion
to
take
a
position
on
what
these
orders
mean.
the
commission
did
not
participate
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
before
ferc
in
this
case.
its
first
participation
was
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
court,
and
it
has
not
addressed
the
question
of
how
these
orders
should
be
construed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
ferc
based
much
of
its
decision
on
the
notion
that
rate
regulation
is
not
the
same
subject
matter
as
what
the
sec
deals
with
in
prescribing
the
internal
accounting
measures
to
be
taken
within
a
group
of
affiliates.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
chevron
deference
applies
to
interpretation
of
statutory
provisions
that
an
agency
administers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
they
would
allow
the
pass-through
of
costs
only
to
the
extent
that
they
would
be
passed
through
by
the
market
criteria.
they...
they
used
a
market
criteria--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
in
this
court
both
agencies
agree
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
318
is
that
ferc
must
yield
to
the
sec
when
otherwise
they...
the
two
agencies
would
be
imposing
conflicting
obligations.
and
that
that
is
what
gives
content
to
whether
they
are
imposing
requirements
with
respect
to
the
same
subject
matter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
yes,
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that's...
that's
has
been--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
am
trying
to
remember
the
precise
circumstances
in
which
the
chevron
cases
came
up,
but
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
believe
there
was
rule
making
involved
in
cftc
against
schor,
if
i
remember
correctly.
i
do
think
some
of
the
others
involved
rule
making.
i
would
have
to
look
back
at
the
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
case
before
the
court
this
term
which
is
the
first...
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
justice,
which
is
the
first
rule
making
proceeding
that
the
nlrb
has
issued.
and
chevron
deference
has
been
applied
a
number
of
times--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
any
event,
none
of
the
court's
previous
cases
in
which
they
deferred
to
interpretations,
such
as
nlrb
against
transportation
management,
involved
rule
making.
that's...
that's
a
prime
example
of
precisely
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
most
i
can
say
is
that
the
sec
agrees
that
the
no-conflict
criterion
is
the
proper
criterion,
but
has
not
yet
taken
a
position
on
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
conflict
between
the
ferc
order
and
the
orders
that
the
sec
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
the
position
of
both
of
the
agencies,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--for
a
determination
of
the
meaning
of
the
sec
orders.
