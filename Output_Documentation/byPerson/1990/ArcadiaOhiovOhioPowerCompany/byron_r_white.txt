how
did
the
court
of
appeals
construe
the
order?
justice
white
you
don't
really
care
whether
the...
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
lose
this
case
if
the...
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
the
sec
purported
to
set
a
ceiling,
would
you?
justice
white
you
don't
really
care,
then?
justice
white
like
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
well,
mr.
phillips,
the
sec's
brief
here
purports
to
quote
an
order.
it
says
that
the
sec
specified
that
the
price
at
which
socco...
i
guess
that's
the
coal
company--
justice
white
--sold
coal
to
ohio
power
could
not
exceed
cost
to
socco.
and
it
purports
to
be
quoting
it.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
at
least
it
said...
it
set
the
price
at
which
socco
could
sell
the
coal.
it
said
could
not
exceed
cost.
justice
white
this
was
a
position
taken
in
a
rate
proceeding,
wasn't
it,
that
they
would
not
allow
the
pass-through
of
costs?
justice
white
xxx
by
the
sec's
orders.
justice
white
we
constantly
defer
to
the
nlrb,
and
it
hardly
in
its
whole
history
has
issued
a
rule.
justice
white
do
you
think
we
should
remand?
justice
white
so
that
is
the
position
of
both
of
the
agencies?
