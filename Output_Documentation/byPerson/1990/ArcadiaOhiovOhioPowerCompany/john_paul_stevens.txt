justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
whether
you
call
it
chevron
deference,
or
whatever
you
call
it,
is
it
correct
that
both
of
the
federal
agencies
feel
there
is
no
conflict
between
their
two
positions?
justice
stevens
as
they
read
the
statute,
the
two
orders
can
stand...
the
ferc
order
can
stand
with
the
sec
order.
justice
stevens
to
which
agency
should
we
remand?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
that
wasn't
speaking
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
stevens
the
general
problem.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
when
it
applied
a
cost
standard
it
was
saying
the
price
may
not
be
above
cost,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
it
should
be
at
cost
even
if
cost
was
higher
than
market.
justice
stevens
the
ferc
set
the
standard--
justice
stevens
--but
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
cost
is
higher
than
market.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
has
the
sec
addressed
the
question
what
should
be
done
in
that
kind
of
situation?
justice
stevens
so
it
hasn't
addressed
the
precise
situation
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
can
i
just
go
back
to
your
description?
justice
stevens
as
you
describe
it,
that
position
would
not
be
violated
by
the
rate
order
in
this
case,
would
it?
justice
stevens
how?
justice
stevens
unless,
you
said.
justice
stevens
it
shall
not
be
above
cost
unless
it
grants
an
exemption.
justice
stevens
so
that
boils
down
to
the
question
whether
when
they
specify
cost
they
mean
it
as
a
direction
it
must
be
at
cost
or
that
that
is
a
ceiling.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
berlin,
your
description
suggests
to
me
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
danger
the
rates
might
be
too
high.
there
was
no
concern
about
undercharging,
was
there?
i
mean,
that's
why
it
fits
right
into
the
notion
that
this
was
intended
to
be
a
ceiling.
justice
stevens
the
first
one,
insofar
as
you
have
described
it,
fits
exactly
into
what
i
just
said,
i
believe.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
the
purpose
of
this
order
was
to
protect
the
stockholders
of
the
parent
company?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you're
using
the
term
cost,
you
know,
and
this,
as
defined
in
this
order
the
cost
is
including
all
sorts
of
things,
based
ultimately
on
the
rate
of
return
which
is
fixed
by
the
rate-making
body,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
the
two
are
inevitably
intertwined.
justice
stevens
it
says
will
be
no
greater
than
the
return,
which
is
language
of
ceiling.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
advances
the
argument,
because
if
you
treat
it
as
a
ceiling
that
would
mean
a
market
that
is
lower
than
cost
would
be
permissible.
so
there
would
be
no
conflict.
justice
stevens
well,
there
might
be
a
conflict
which
would
be
present
when
market
exceeded
cost.
justice
stevens
are
those
two
occasions
described
in
the
findings?
i
didn't--
justice
stevens
--has
the
sec
ever
objected
to
that?
justice
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me,
just
to
jump
ahead
a
little
bit,
that
if
that
situation
developed
and
the
sec
thought
it
violated
the
basic
order,
they
could
easily
go
in
and
say
to,
say
there
is
a
conflict
here,
in
the
case
of
conflict
our
order
prevails.
and
they
would
win
hands
down,
if
they
really
felt
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
order.
justice
stevens
you
mean
the
sec
has
the
opportunity?
justice
stevens
of
enforcing
its
orders.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
you
would
certainly
be
able
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
sec
right
away.
it
would
be
a
very
simple
situation.
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
it
means
just
we're
concerned
about
conflicts,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
adequately
protected
by
your
resort
to
go
to
the
sec
and
say
hey
look,
they
are
making
us
pay
market
and
that
is
in
excess
of
cost.
justice
stevens
and
then
the
sec
could
come
back
and
say
in
order
to
protect
the
stockholders
of
the
parent
company
we
are
going
to
insist
on
our
order
being
obeyed.
justice
stevens
excuse
me,
isn't
a
more
direct
answer
to
that
question
simply
that
the
sec
does
not
have
the
option
of
enforcing
its
orders
or
not?
if
there
is
an
order
on
the
book
which
you
are
entitled
to
have
enforced,
if
the
sec
chooses
not
to
enforce
it
you
should
be
able
to
come
into
a
court
and
get
it
enforced.
isn't
that
right?
