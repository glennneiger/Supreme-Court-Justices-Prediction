justice
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
sec
order?
does
it
require
that
coal
be
purchased
at
cost,
or
is
it
just
a
ceiling?
justice
o'connor
so
you
don't
concede
that
at
least
the
sec
orders
effectively
set
a
ceiling?
justice
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
i
take
it
that
the
court
below
thought
that
the
term
"subject
matter"
could
be
interpreted
broadly,
and
do
you
think
that
the
court
below
made
at
least
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute,
a
possible
construction
of
the
statute,
so
that
we
get
into
a
deference
question?
is...
is
their
interpretation
a
reasonable
one?
