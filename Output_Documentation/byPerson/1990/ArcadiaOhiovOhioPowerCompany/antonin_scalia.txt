justice
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
someone
would
be...
would
be
injured
if
an
acquisition
of
a
company
that
has
coal
reserves
that
is
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
using
those
reserves
in
the...
in
the
operation
of
a
utility
run
by
another
one
of
the
affiliated
companies,
if
it
turns
out
that
that
can't
be
done?
wasn't
the
sec
in
effect
approving
the
acquisition
of
a
subsidiary
for
the
very
purpose
of
using
the
coal
reserves
of
that
subsidiary
in
the
generating?
justice
scalia
i
am
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
sec
approved,
though.
and
the
sec
approved...
approved
that
agreement
which
said
that
the
sale
would
be
at
cost?
is
that
what
it
said?
what
did
it
say?
justice
scalia
even...
even
where
the
market
price
is
above
cost?
justice
scalia
yes,
sir.
are
you
saying
that
despite
this
commitment
that...
that
it
would
not...
it
would
not
violate
the
arrangement
that
the
sec
approved
to
sell
above
cost,
so
long
as
it's...
it's
not
above
market
price?
justice
scalia
if
cost
means
market,
i
don't...
i
don't
even
know
how
we
can
communicate
anymore.
justice
scalia
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
sec's
approving...
approving
these
contracts?
justice
scalia
well,
don't
you...
let's
turn
to
section
13(b).
it
says
or
otherwise
into
or
take
any
step
in
the
performance
of
any
service,
sales,
or
construction
contract
by
which
that
company
undertakes
to
perform
services
or
construction
work
for
or
sell
goods
to
any
associate
company.
you
are
saying
there
was
never
any
approval
of
that?
justice
scalia
so
they
are
describing
the
contracts
as
part
of
the
representations
on
which
the
approval
of
the
financing
transaction
is
based.
justice
scalia
oh,
you
don't
consider
that--
justice
scalia
--a
commitment.
you're
saying
they
are
just
being
described.
justice
scalia
i
think
it's
the
first
one
to
get
here.
i
think
it
is
actually
the
second,
but
that's
all
right.
justice
scalia
that's
a
conflict
rationale
you
are
describing,
and
that
was
not
the
rationale
that
was
used
by
the
court
below.
i
mean,
you
may
well
be
right
about
it,
but...
and
maybe
those...
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
would
agree
with
you.
justice
scalia
13(b)
does
refer,
in
fact,
to
both
investors
or
consumers.
justice
scalia
it
does
say
protect
both
investors
and
consumers--
justice
scalia
--which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
you
can
neither
be
above
course
nor
below
cost.
justice
scalia
and
it
does
say
such
contracts
shall
be
performed
economically
and
efficiently
at
cost,
not
at
no...
more
than
cost,
but
it
says
at
cost.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
berlin,
you
come
in
talking
field
preemption,
as
you...
as
you
are
now,
but
you
ultimately
end
up
defining
the
field
by
finding
a
conflict.
and
i
think
that
is
probably
right,
because
that
is
the
only
way
i
could
possibly
define
the
field.
if
you
say
that
they
are
both
dealing
with
the
same
subject,
you
know,
anything
the
fc...
sec
promulgates
in
this
field
deals
with
holding
companies,
right?
and
any
order
of
the,
of
ferc
dealing
with
holding
companies
would
deal
with
the
same
subject,
if
you
want
to
define
it
that
broadly.
how
do
you
decide
how
broadly
you
define
the
subject?
justice
scalia
okay,
you
think
it's
a
conflict
case.
justice
scalia
that
is
what
i
mean
by
field
preemption.
justice
scalia
--and
you'd
say
that's
no
good?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
determine
the
field?
how
do
you
determine
what
the
field
is?
why
isn't
the
field
all
holding,
you
know,
all
holding...
regulating
holding
company
activities?
justice
scalia
yes.
so
the
sec
issues
rules
governing
bookkeeping.
it
says
you
shall
keep
books
in
this
fashion.
it
is
very
clearly
addressed
to
keeping
the
corporate
books.
ferc
comes
up
with
a
requirement
and
says
well,
in
order
for
us
to
do
our
job
you
have
to,
in
addition,
do
these
things
in...
in
your
books.
now
is
that
the
same
field?
supplemental
requirement.
it
goes
beyond
what
the
sec
said.
why
doesn't
your
theory
say,
well,
this
is
the
same
field?
does
it?
justice
scalia
make
believe
it's
not.
you
know,
don't
make
me
make
up
another
one.
justice
scalia
but
the
sec
comes
in
and
says
look
it,
you
have
this
all
wrong...
or
ferc
comes
in
and
says
you
have
this
all
wrong.
the
subject
matter
is
not
bookkeeping.
i
mean,
the
sec
just
said
you
had
bookkeeping
rules
1,
2,
3,
4,
5.
that
was
the
subject
matter,
rules
1
to
5.
we
have
totally
different
rules,
6
to
10.
now
they
both
pertain
to
bookkeeping,
but
they
also
both
pertain
to
holding
companies.
and
you
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
simply
because
the
sec
can
do
something
that
pertains
to
the
subject
matter
of
holding
companies
we
can't
do
anything
at
all.
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
berlin,
is
i
think
when
it
comes
down
to
it
you
are
defining
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
by
looking
for
a
conflict.
you
have
to
go
down
the
levels
of
generality
until
you
find
a
conflict,
and
you
say
ah
ha,
where
there
is
a
conflict,
now
i
know
what
the
subject
matter
is.
justice
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
irreconcilable
conflict
in
nantahala
either,
but
one
doesn't...
just
as
one
doesn't
interpret
a
federal-state
relationship
to
allow
the
trapping
of
costs,
one
should
not
interpret
two
federal
agency
relationships
to
trap
costs.
now
as
i
understand
it,
the
holding
company
acquired
this
asset
with
an
understanding
under
section
13(b)
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
that
the
sec
would...
would
make
sure
that
the
contracts
are
performed
at
cost.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
justice
scalia
you
do
not
think
that
it
was
envisioned
by
the
congress
that
enacted
that
provision
that
you
be
able
to
get
that
money
back
when
you
sold
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
arcadia
ohio
and
14
other
petitioners,
that
purchase
wholesale
electricity
from
ohio
power,
challenged
a
rate
increase
filed
by
ohio
power
in
1982.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
in
the
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction
to
assure
adjust
and
reasonable
rates,
disallowed
that
portion
of
ohio
power's
rates
attributable
to
ohio
power's
cost
of
coal.
ohio
power's
coal
was
purchased
primarily
from
its
own
subsidiary,
the
southern
ohio
coal
company
at
cost.
southern
ohio
coal
company
bears
the
regrettable
acronym
of
socco.
ohio
power
argued
that
because
its
acquisition
of
socco
had
been
approved
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
and
because
the
approval
orders
indicated
that
that
coal
would
be
priced
at
cost,
ferc
could
not
disallow
that
portion
of
ohio
power's
costs
which
reflected
these
coals
charges.
ohio
power
based
its
argument
on
section
318
of
the
federal
power
act
which
provides
that
when
the
sec
and
ferc
regulate
the
same
subject
matter,
the
regulation
of
the
sec
takes
precedence.
because
the
sec
had
regulated
the
price
of
coal,
ohio
power
argued
ferc
was
not
permitted
through
its
rates
jurisdiction
to
regulate
in
effect
the
same
subject
matter.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
the
unanimous
opinion,
we
now
reverse
because
section
318
has
no
application
to
this
case.
section
318
begins
with
a
carefully
detailed
clause
listing
the
subjects
with
respect
to
which
the
sec
preemption
rule
applies.
that
clause
ends
with
the
phrase
"or
any
other
subject
matter"
but
we
do
not
believe
that
that
phrase
stands
alone
as
a
parallel
object
of
the
proposition
with
respect
to.
instead,
it
is
part
of
the
fourth
enumerated
category
of
parallel
ferc
and
sec
regulation
which
reads
"the
acquisition
or
disposition
of
any
security,
capital,
assets,
facilities,
or
any
other
subject
matter"
so
read,
section
318
does
not
apply
to
the
alleged
conflict
that
exists
in
this
case.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
and
because
there
are
other
issues,
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
because
of
its
application
of
section
318,
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
joined
the
court's
opinion
and
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joined.
justice
souter
took
no
part.
