chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-1283,
arcadia,
ohio
v.
the
ohio
power
company.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
sec's
angle
here?
what
would
be
their
purpose
in
setting
a
ceiling?
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
are
they
protecting,
or
who
are
they
looking
out
for?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
would
think
that
they
would...
aren't
they
supposed
to
look
out
for
either
the
coal
company
here
or
a
subsidiary,
rather
than
the
principal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
makes
no
sense
at
all
in
terms
of
ordinary
english
usage.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how...
how
do
you
define
the
phrase
318?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
given
me
a
possible
application.
how
do
you
define
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
an
extremely
narrow
definition.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
berlin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
berlin,
the
orders
that
have...
we
have
been
referred
to
entered
by
the
sec
in
this
case
are
somewhat
ambiguous,
it
seems
to
me,
as
to
just
what
they
are
doing.
what
is
the
sec's
goal
in
regulating
the
price
paid
by
ohio
power
company
for
captive
coal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
it's
a
question
to
me
whether
the
final
paragraph
of
those
orders
incorporates
all
the
recitals.
that
is
why
i
am
interested
in
getting
an
answer
to
the
question
that
i
just
asked
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
i
am
sitting
as
a
commissioner
of
the
sec,
this
transaction
comes
in,
ohio
power
is
talking
about
getting
some
securities,
they
recite
that
they
are
going
to
pay
so
much
for
coal
from
a
captive
coal
company.
what
is
the
interest
of
the
sec
in
regulating
that
particular
transaction?
not
the
securities
transaction,
but
the
price
that
ohio...
ohio
power
is
paying
to
its
captive
company?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
but
why
is
the
sec
interested
in
this
particular
price?
chief
justice
rehnquist
investors
in
the
sense
of
investors
in
the
company
that
owns
all
the
affiliates?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
that
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
was
to
protect
the
investors
in
ohio
power
company,
which
is
the
holding
company.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
berlin,
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1283,
arcadia
ohio
versus
ohio
power
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
