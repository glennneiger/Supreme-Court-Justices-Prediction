justice
kennedy
so
you're
saying
if
the
jury
in
the
jury
room
agrees
at
the
outset
that
first
degree
premeditated
murder
has
not
been
proven,
at
that
point,
if
they...
they
cannot
consistently
go
to
second
degree
murder?
justice
kennedy
but...
but
in
felony
murder,
the
defendant
must
cause
the
death
in
arizona?
justice
kennedy
and
there
was
no
instruction
to
that
effect
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
in
this
case,
there's
no
instruction
that
the
defendant
must
have
caused
the
death
for
there
to
be
a
capital
conviction?
justice
kennedy
i
understand
that
for
premeditated--
justice
kennedy
--and
that's
not...
that's
not
required
in
a
capital
case?
justice
kennedy
is
that
any
different
from
saying
you
can
convict
a
burglary
if
he
broke
through
the
door
or
broke
through
the
window,
and
six
jurors
think
he
went
through
the
door
and
six
jurors
think
he
went
through
the
window?
justice
kennedy
what's
the
difference?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
can't
go...
you
can't
go
through
both
the
door
or
the
window.
your
go
through
one
or
the
other.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
first
degree
murder
in
arizona
requires
that
you...
one
of
two
possible
ways
of
doing
it.
justice
kennedy
well,
is
it
unconstitutional
for
arizona
to
draft
its
statute
in
this
way?
justice
kennedy
--not
just
capital
cases.
well,
unless...
unless
it
was
defined
as
an...
just
an
element
is
a
felony.
you
might
semantically
say
that
in
justice
scalia's
example
that
the
elements
are
the
same
whether
it's
robbery
or
rape.
justice
kennedy
there
are
not
many
indictments--
--but
you
don't
need...
in
other
words,
you
can
say
that
and
still
prevail
in
your
case,
because
you
can
say
the
elements
of
premeditated
murder
and
felony
murder
are
different.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
think
it
is
unless
you
want
to
have
some
special
rules
for
capital
cases.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
your
logic
takes
you
there.
what
about
that
federal
statute
that
punishes
as
an
accomplice
anybody
who
aids,
counsels,
procures,
abets,
commands?
does
the
jury
have
to
be
instructed...
do
they
have
to
be...
it
was
either
commanding
or
counseling
or
procuring?
they
have
to
all
agree
on
which
of
the
three?
justice
kennedy
because
those
are
really
a
different
act.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
that...
counsel
for
the
petitioner
i
think
will
say
that
that's
not
her
argument.
she's
saying
that
there
are
different...
in
the
example
you've
put,
killing
by
strangulation
and
drowning,
the...
the
mental
state
is
the
same.
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
the
same.
but
here
you
do
not
need
to
be
participate...
to
have
caused
the
death
of
the
victim
for...
of
felony
murder.
justice
kennedy
then
you'd
need
only...
and
you
need
only
have
been
intended
to
engage
in
the
robbery.
justice
kennedy
when
you
need
only
to
have
intended
to
engaged
in
the
robbery.
justice
kennedy
so
the...
you're
saying...
are
you
saying
that
the
elements
are
the
same
for
felony
murder
and
for
premeditated
murder
in
arizona?
justice
kennedy
how
about
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury,
now
there's
two
different
routes
you
can
go,
two
different
prongs
to
this
statute.
and
the
argument
is
that
those
are
different
elements
in
each
case.
justice
kennedy
it's
not...
not
immediately
clear
to
me
that
those
aren't
different
elements.
justice
kennedy
well,
what's...
what's
the
standard
that
you
using
in
order
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question
in
which
you
said
that
the
hypothetical
statute
he
put
of
a
generic
felony
statute
has
a
due
process
problem?
what
is
this
standard
you
have
to
meet
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
due
process?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
crime
is
the
one
justice
scalia
put.
it's...
it
is
the
crime
of
being
a
dangerous
person.
and
you
can
do
it
by
robbing
a
bank,
committing
arson,
or
reckless
driving.
justice
kennedy
well,
that's...
that's
the
argument
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy
what's
the
difference
in
the
two
cases,
and
what's
the
standard
you
use
to
determine
that...
that
one
is
valid
and
the
other
is
invalid?
justice
kennedy
well,
would
you
say
there
has
to
be
a
close
conceptual
mens
rea
between
the
acts
that
are
grouped
in
this
same
statute?
justice
kennedy
but
you
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
due
process
analysis?
justice
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
if
you
have
an
indictment
in
which
you'd
alleged
just
the
felony
murder
aspect
of
the
arizona
statute,
there
is
no
requirement
for
any
lesser
included
offense
under
beck?
