justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
if
your
theory
is
right.
you...
i
understood
your
theory
to
be
it
ends
with
different
elements
of
the
offense.
justice
stevens
with
the...
with
justice
kennedy's
example,
it's
the
same
element,
namely
entry,
that
you
don't
care
how
he
got
in
if
they
all
thought
he
broke
in.
but
here
you've
got
two
different
elements
that
are
mutually
exclusive,
really.
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive,
but
he
either
robbed
or
he
intended
to
kill.
those
are
different
elements.
i
thought
that
was
your
theory--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
right
there?
supposing
arizona
had...
in
your
very
hypothetical...
one
statute
prohibiting
death
by...
killing
by
drowning
which
had
a...
which
was
not
a
capital
case,
where
as
death
by
strangulation
was
a
capital
case.
would
they
then
be
required
to
find
out
which
way
it
was
done?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i
just
said
that
your
two
examples
as
i
understood
you
were
death
by
strangulation
and
death
by
drowning,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
my
question
to
you
is...
i
think
to
put
your
question,
you
have
to
assume
the
statute
only
applied...
there's
a
special
crime
of
killing
by
drowning.
and
then
would
they
not
have
to
find
that
there
was
killing
by
drowning?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
we
don't
have
a
dispute
about
one
rather
fundamental
thing?
as
i
understand
it
in
the
premeditated
murder,
there's
the
element
of
the
killing,
the
element
of
malice
which
can
proved
by
the
use
of
the
weapon,
and
thirdly,
there's
premeditation.
and
that
in
the
other
theory,
all
that's
necessary
is
to
prove
that
there
was
robbery
and
a
killing.
and
there's
no
requirement
of
premeditation.
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
well,
no,
that
are
two
different
ways
of
proving
the
same
offense,
and--
justice
stevens
--what
i'm
really
asking
is
can
you
prove
the
offense
at
issue
in
this
case
by
proving
robbery
and
that
a
death
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
robbery
without
proving
that
the
defendant
had
any
intent
to
kill?
justice
stevens
well,
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
stevens
may
i
just...
because
i
don't
think
this
makes
a
difference
in
the
end
result,
but
i
just
want
to
get
my
thinking
straightened
out.
in
this
particular
case
and
the
judge
imposed
the
death
penalty,
it
is
possible,
is
it
not,
that
the
basis
for
his
decision
that
inman
and
tison
were
satisfied
was
his
own
finding
of
fact,
because
he
couldn't
be
sure
whether
the
jury
had
found
the
kind
of
intent
that
tison
required?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
would
he
have
been
permitted
to
do
that
if
the
jury
had
only
been
instructed
on
felony
murder
and
in
effect...
or
had
two
separate
counts
and
rejected
the
premeditated
and
found
felony,
would
he
still
be
permitted
under
arizona
law
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
about
second
degree
murder?
what
if...
does
he
have
to
have
done
the
killing
to
be
guilty
of
second
degree
murder?
now,
supposing
the
facts
showed
that
he...
he
did
not
kill
and
had
no
intent
to
kill,
but
he
was
a
participant
in
the
robbery.
and
he
intended
to
rob
and
there
was
a
death
in
the
course
of
it,
but
an
accomplice
did
the
killing.
and
he'd
be
guilty
of
felony
murder.
would
he
also
be
guilty
of
second
degree
murder?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
you
had
to
follow
the
law,
that
they
could
not
have
done
that
consistently
with
the
law.
justice
stevens
well,
no,
i'm
just
saying...
forget
what
these
instructions...
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law--
justice
stevens
--if
the
jury
was
totally
convinced
and
properly
instructed
that
he
did...
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
killing
except
his
participation
in
the
robbery,
but
he
was
guilty
of
the
robbery,
could
they...
and
consistently
with
arizona
law,
find
him
guilty
of
a
second
degree
murder?
