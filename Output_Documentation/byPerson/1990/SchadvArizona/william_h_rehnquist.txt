chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-5551,
edward
harold
schad,
jr.
v.
arizona.
ms.
young.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
a
verdict
in
the
guilt
phase,
ms.
young?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
young,
did
the
judge
give
any
lesser
included
offense
instruction
at
all
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
do
you
think
beck
requires,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
any
number
of
lesser
included
offense
instructions
if...
if
the
evidence
makes
them
out.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
by
one
or
the
other.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you've
got
to
have
some
finding
as
to
the
burglary
to
make
it
felony
murder.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
don't
you
think
under
your
theory
you
would
also
have
to
find
all
the
elements
of
burglary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
would
it
depend
on
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
would
it
depend
on
the
facts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is...
is
the
key
to
your
theory
the
fact
that
you...
you
must
prove
burglary
as
one...
as
one
element
if
you're
going
the
felony
murder
route
to
first
degree,
but
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
details
of
burglary,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
why...
why
aren't
you
insisting
on
that
here
or
rather
why
don't
you
say
that
the...
if...
if
the
jury
splits
as
to
whether
it
was
a
door
or
window,
that
is
unconstitutional?
she
just...
she
just
did.
if...
if
it
was...
if
the
jury
was
required
to
choose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that's...
that's
the
present
state
of
federal
law?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
is...
are
you
saying
that
the
answer
to
justice...
that
the
present
state
of
federal
law
is
that
if
a
particular
statute
says
aids,
abets,
counsels,
et
cetera,
that
a
jury
must
have
a
separate
form
of
verdict
and
unanimously
find
either
one
or
the
other
of
those?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
you
have
them.
that's
your
hypothesis,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
don't
know
how
the
jury--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--very
well,
ms.
young.
mr.
ford,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
what
case
do
you
say
this
court
established
that
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
young,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
young.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-5551,
schad
against
arizona
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
