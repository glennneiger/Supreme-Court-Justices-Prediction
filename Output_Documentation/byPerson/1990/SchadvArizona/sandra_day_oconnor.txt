justice
o'connor
well,
is
it...
is
it
all
that
clear
that
beck
should
be
read
as
requiring
the
giving
of
every
potential
lesser
included
offense
rather
than
just
a
less
drastic
alternative
than
the
death
penalty
which
was
given
here?
i
would
think
one
could
read
beck
to
require
no
more
than
that.
justice
o'connor
and
if
not,
why
shouldn't
we
read
it
that
way?
