mr.
r.
wayne
ford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
this
case
presents
is
the
classical
death
by
strangulation/drowning
situation
that
you
often
see
raised
in
the
law
schools
by
the
law
professors
where
a
victim
is
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
swimming
pool.
and
when
he's
pulled
out
and
goes
to
the
morgue
and
the
medical
examiner
examines
him,
finds
also
that
the
death
could
have
been...
there's
conclusive
evidence
that
could
have
been
also
strangled
as
well
as
drowned.
and
the
question
that
this
case
presents
is
whether
the
jury
is
constitutionally
required
which
of
the
two
had
happened.
in
this
case,
of
course,
there's
not
a
drowning.
my
position
in
this
situation
is
that
it
is
a
question
of--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--i...
my
assumption
was
that
the
death
by
drowning
by
a
forcible...
it
was
a
killing...
and
that
the
jury
ultimately
decides
that
way.
if
it
was
an
accidental
drowning--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--my...
my
presumption
should
have
been
that
it
was
death
by
drowning...
by
forcible
drowning.
and
the
jury
unanimously
decided
there
was
a
killing.
must
they
then...
are
they
then
constitutionally
required
to
decide
whether
the
killing
was
by
forcible
drowning
or
whether--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--under
the...
if
the
statute
said
killing
by
drowning?
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
then
the
jury
would
have
to
be
unanimous
in
making
that
finding.
however,
under
the
arizona
statute,
it
does
not
specify
killing
by
drowning.
the
arizona
legislature,
in
its
prerogative
of
defining
a
crime,
said
that
first
degree
murder
is
the
killing
with
malice
of
forethought.
that
is
the
crime.
that
is
the
level
that...
to
be
attained.
that
is
the
offense
under
our
statute.
then
they
realized
that
there
were
different
methods
of
committing
first
degree
murder,
and--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--if
that's
the
position
that
the
petitioner
is
taking,
i'd
say--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--pardon
me?
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that...
that
is
an
issue
that
is
determined
in
arizona
at
the
sentencing
stage.
what
the...
if
you're
asking
about
the
mental
intent
that
was
involved
in
it.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
the
elements
of
the
crime
were...
are
the
same
for
first
degree
murder
in
arizona.
there
are
two
doctrines
under
which
the...
there
are
multiple
doctrines
under
which
an
individual
may
be...
the...
the
charge
may
be
presented
to
the
jury,
but
as
far
as
the
conviction...
as
far
as
the
verdict
that's
returned...
as
far
as
the
statute
that's
used
to
charge
it,
it
is
first
degree
murder.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
no,
i
disagree
that
the
prosecutor
presented
that
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
and
if...
even
if
he
did,
the
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
were
not
to
that
effect.
the
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
were
the
defendant
is
charged
with
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder.
you
may
find
that
he
committed
first
degree
murder.
if
you
find
that
he
premeditatedly
committed
the
crime,
then
we
also
find
first
degree
murder
if
you
find
that
he
committed...
was...
committed
the
killing
during
the
commission
of
a
robbery.
so
that--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--those
not
elements
of
the
crime
per
the
statute.
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
is
a
killing
with
malice
of
forethought.
then
the
legislature
decided
to,
for
sentencing
purposes
at
least,
for
punishment
purposes,
to
categorize
whether
it
would
be
first
degree
murder
or
second
degree
murder
and
put
that
burden
on
the
jury
and
make
that
determination.
whether
they
should
find
this
happened
with...
with
these
different
events
that
they
found
more
reprehensible,
they
would
put
it
under
a
first
degree
murder
category.
the
second
degree
category...
or
the
first
degree
category
they
punish
by
either
death
or
life
imprisonment.
but
the
second
degree
category
is
a
lesser
punishment.
and
those
are
the
less
reprehensible.
so
as
far
as
the
elements
are
concerned,
it
is
a
fact
finding
that
the
jury
must
find
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
it
is
one
of
the
findings.
but
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
as
defined
by
the
statute.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
i
believe
that
the
legislators...
the
legislature's
prerogative
would
be
able
to
do...
if
you're
talking
about
the
traditional
type
crime,
which
would
be
like
the
homicide
crime,
if
you
place
that...
if
you
say
not
as
a
felony.
but
if
you
say
the
crime
in
this
case
is
homicide
and
you
may
find
that
the
defendant
committed
homicide
by
these
different
fashions
and
include
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter
and
perhaps
even
negligent
homicide.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
it
would
depend
on
how
the
statute
would
be
written.
i
was--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--okay.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
if...
if
you
mean
that
there
a
robbery
independent
and
we're
going
to
punish
him
for
a...
a
homicide,
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
do
that.
if
you're
saying
that
he
commit
a
homicide
by
robbery,
then
i
think
the
legislature--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--okay.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
okay.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
i
believe
that
arizona...
that
the
legislature
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
that.
i
believe
you'd
be
running
into
a
due
process,
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
which--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--because
you're
talking
about
a
traditional
category
of
crime
here.
you're
talking
about
the
legislature
has
decided
to
define
the
offense
of
homicide
or
murder
in
this
specific
instance.
that
is
a
category
i
believe
that
the
legislature
should
be
allowed
to
designate
as
an
offense...
call
it
homicide
or
call
it
murder
which
ever
you
call
it...
and
should
be
allowed
to
say
if
you
commit
a
homicide
by
any
of
these
means,
then
you
have
committed
the
crime
of
homicide.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
way
this
statute
is
written
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
jury
is
making
the
determination
of
the
crime
that
is
charged
in
that
case,
as
opposed
to--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--if
you
define
it
that
way,
then
you're
beyond...
i
foresee
the
problem
there
as...
what
you're
doing
is
you're
giving
up
the
jury's...
the
defendant's
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
giving
it
over
to
the
judge
merely
because
the
jury
is
deciding,
okay,
he
did
something
wrong.
three
can
find
it
this
way,
and
six
can
find
it
that
way,
and
three
the
other
way.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
i
disagree,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--the
line
that
i
would
draw
would
be
if
it
falls
within
one
of
the
traditional
type
of
crimes,
then
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
legislature
to
say,
you
have
committed
a
homicide.
but
they
can't
throw
in
and
say
that
you
will
be
guilty
of...
we
will
find
you
under
the
law
guilty
of
a
homicide
if
you
commit
speeding
in
an
automobile.
that's
without--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--that
has
been
one
of
the
factors
that
has
been
considered
in
classifying
crimes
throughout
history.
yes,
the--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--oh,
it...
due
process
is
certainly
involved
in
that,
yes.
due
process
under
the
reasonable
doubt
statute
would
be...
or
under
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
of
proof
would
be
involved
in
that.
however,
it
brings
us
back
to
this
crime
when
you
classify
it
under
a
murder.
we're
very,
very
narrow
in
the
traditional
category
of
crimes
now.
we're
saying
that
you
can
commit
murder.
the
legislature
has
said
you
can
commit
murder
by
poison,
or
torture,
or
lying
in
wait,
premeditation,
or
during
the
commission
of
any
of
these
felonies.
that
has...
is
something
the
legislature
can
say.
that
is
something...
there
is
no
constitutional
bar
to
the
legislature
making
a
single
statute
and
putting--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--if...
if
they
had...
if
they
came
back
with
separate
verdicts
itself,
yes,
under
the
arizona
statute.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
we're
talking
about
the
way...
the
manner
in
which
the
murder
was
committed
as
opposed
to
whether
a
murder
was
committed.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
if
six
jurors
found,
yes,
that
there
was...
that
he
killed
by
premeditation
and
six
found
that
he
commit...
that
he
killed
during
the
commission
of
a
felony,
there's
no
problem
under
that.
there's
no
constitutional
bar
to
the
legislature
defining
such
a
crime.
those
are
merely
different
ways.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
because
12
people
voted
for
the
offense.
the
focus
on
a
murder
crime
is
on
the
killing
and
not
on
how
it
was
committed.
as--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--no,
no.
if
i
said
that
or
implied
that,
i
misspoke.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
due
process
would
be,
under
winship,
keyed
to
reasonable
doubt.
but
i
was...
trying
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
was
as
to
a
generic
crime
of
a
felony...
i
believe
it
was
originally--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--i
was
saying
that
there
would
not
be
a
reasonable
doubt
question
if
you're
talking
about
a
category
of
crimes
such
as,
in
this
case,
the
way
it's
defined
in
arizona,
of
murder.
you're
talking--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--as
i
understood
justice
scalia's
question,
it
spoke
to
the
fact
that
we
have
several...
we
just
designate
one
crime
as
being
a
felony,
and
that
could
include
from
homicide
all
the
way
down
to
traffic--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--i...
i
do
foresee
the
problem
there,
when
you
start
crossing
the
lines
between
categories
of
crimes.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
i'm
saying
that
where
it
falls
under
a
certain
type
category
of
crime
that
you
wouldn't
have
the
reasonable
doubt
problem.
if
you
only
have
two
theories,
such
as
murder
and
reckless
driving,
then
i
think
that
you
would
have
a
problem,
because
what
you're
doing
is
your
taking
away
from
the
jury
that
decision
to
make
reasonable
doubt
and
you're
giving
it
to
the
judge.
and
you're
talking
about
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
you
mean
as
a
generic
felony
or
as
a--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--that's...
in
almost
all
states,
including
the
federal
government,
murder
is
defined.
federal
statute,
in
fact,
is
almost
identical
to
the
arizona
statute.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
absolutely.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
with
the
court...
the
trial
court
actually
submits
the
different
forms?
they
are
a...
they
have
done
that
in
some
cases
in
arizona,
and
the
practical
effect--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--for
a
different
reason
than
what
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
it
has
suggested--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--i'm
unaware
of
it
being
done
in
the
federal
system
or
any
other
system.
to
carry
on
with
that
thought,
the
reason
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
doing
that
is
so
that
what
it's
talking
about
is
the
punishment.
it
has
a
better
view
of
what
is
going
to
happen,
and
it
specifically
states
that
in
smith
and
the
other...
and
the
other
case
that
we're...
that
happened
here.
so
that
the
judge...
the
sentencing
judge
and
at
the
reviewing
court
has
a
better
idea
of
how
the
jury
concluded
this,
so
that
the
trial
judge
can
make
the
decision
whether
or
not
this
individual
was
the
one
that
either
killed
or
intended
to
kill
or--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--that's
the
death
penalty
exclusively.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that
is
correct
to
a
point.
first,
it
presumes
that
there's
two
different
offenses,
which
there
aren't.
but--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--right,
and
if
you
prove
first
degree
murder
and--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--yes.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
the
statute
so
reads
that
because
we're...
what
we're
doing
in
all
felony
murder
situations...
you're
transferring
the
specific
intent
from
the
felony
to
satisfy
the
premeditation
issue
which
all
comes
down...
that's
why
they're
satisfied
in
that
way.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
without...
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
for
first
degree...
for
murder?
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
there's
killing
with
malice
of
forethought.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that's
the
way
the
statute
was
defined
at
the
time--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--either
way.
it
can
be
express
or
implied,
as
it's
stated
in
the
statute.
so
it
is
my
position
in
this
case
that
the
arizona
legislature
can
constitutionally
create
a
statute
that
is...
shows
one
offense
that
can
be
committed
in
several
different
ways
and
the
jury
is
not
constitutionally
required
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
ways
it
happened.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
in
arizona
the
trial
court
is
required
to
make
the
finding
during
the
sentencing
phase,
yes.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
independent
of
what
the
jury
may
have
found.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
yes,
he
would
have
been.
under
the
facts,
the
judge
has
to
make
that
decision,
regardless
of
how
the
jury
returns
the
verdict.
with
respect
to
the
second
issue
of
lesser
included
offense,
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
adopt
a
theory
that
it
has
already
rejected,
which
is
called
the
inherent
relationship
theory.
she
has
asked
the
court
to
say
that
where
some
fact
during
the
trial
establishes
the
existence
of
a
crime
other
than
that
crime
charged
that
the
jury
must
have
that
option
to
return
that
verdict
as
opposed
to
the
verdict
that's
charged
merely
because
the
jury
may
decide
it
wants
to
see
another...
it
doesn't
want
to
impose
the
capital
crime.
that
is
not
the
case
in
arizona.
under
arizona
law
robbery
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
first
degree
murder.
it's
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
felony
murder.
it
is
a
separate,
independent
crime
that
can
be
charged
separately,
prosecuted
separately,
convicted
and
punished
independently.
that
makes
it
an
independent,
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
this
court
and
arizona
have
both
adopted
the
statutory
elements
test,
which
is
to
analyze
the
statute
of
both
offenses
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
elements
are
the
same
with
the
exception
of
one
element.
in
this
case,
can
murder
be
committed
without
necessarily
committing
robbery.
and
of
course
you--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--it's
a
matter
of
procedure
and
established
that
in
schmuck
v.
united
states,
your
honor,
1989
case
out
of
this
court.
it
was
for
that
express...
it
didn't
limit
it
to,
but
it
said
that
it
would
be
for
purposes
of
rule
31,
the
rules
of
procedure,
that
the
inherent
relationship
test
is
not
the
test
to
apply
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
a
lesser
included
offense.
that's
the
same
test
that
is
used
in
arizona.
and
because
of
that
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
and
this
court
in
spaziano
v.
florida,
for
example,
said
that
if
there
is
no
lesser
included
offense,
if
it
does
not
exist,
then
it
should
not
be
instructed
on
it.
i
would
also,
in
passing,
state
that
beck
is
limited,
in
my
opinion,
to
capital
cases.
it
was
never
intended
to
extend
beyond
a
capital
case
to
give
the
jury
the
option
of
finding
a
nonhomicide
issue.
it
was
for
the
purpose...
what
beck
said
was
that
the
state
cannot
pass
a
law
that
would
prohibit
a
jury
from
considering
an
existing
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
there
was
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
second
degree
murder
is
any
type
of
murder
that
is
not
first
degree.
in
other
words,
if
there's
no
premeditation,
no
willfulness,
no
deliberation,
no
felony--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--to
get
a
second
degree
murder?
under
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case
that
was
not
matter...
it
is
a
matter
of
law
in
arizona.
but
under
the
way
that
they
were
instructed...
i'd
refer
the
court
to
page
26
and
27
of
the
joint
appendix.
they
were
instructed
merely
if
you
have
a
doubt
in
this
case
as
to
first
degree
murder,
then
you
may
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
the
court
did
not
distinguish
between
if
you
find
him
guilty
of
premeditated
murder,
you
may.
but
you
can't
if
you
find
him
of
felony
murder.
so
practically
speaking,
this
jury
was
not
faced
with
that
problem.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
right.
they
would
find
him
as
the
court--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--under
the...
the
instructions
didn't
exactly
follow
the
law.
that's
right.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that's
right.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
under
the
instructions,
that's
exactly
what
happened...
would
have
happened.
the
jury
had
the
option
in
this
case
of
finding
the
defendant
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
a
capital
offense,
or
guilty
of
second
degree
murder,
a
noncapital
offense.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
at
that
time
i
believe
the
capital...
the
top
end
was
15
years...
either
10
or
15
years
in
arizona.
i
believe
the
bottom
end
was
5.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
5
to
15.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
it
would
be
in
the
same
type
of
category.
they're
both...
if
it
was
an
armed
robbery,
it
would
have
occurred...
it
would
have
been
in
the...
in
the
same...
felony...
second
class
felony.
it
would
have
been
approximately
the
same.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
no,
he
could
not
be.
there
is
no
second
degree
felony
murder
in
arizona.
so
that
if
the
jury's...
if
the...
the
critical
evidence
in
this
case
was
the...
evidence
that
he
had
the
property
an
the
proceeds
of
the
robbery
and
all.
if
they
believe
that
he
was
a
robber,
they
could
not
have
found
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder?
if
they
found
that
he
had--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--yes.
if
they...
if
they
had
been
instructed
that
if
you
find
that
he
is
guilty
of
robbery,
then
you
cannot
find
him
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
okay.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
no.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that's
correct.
under
beck,
under
arizona
law,
there
is
no
allowable...
there
is
no
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
not
under
arizona
law,
no.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
that
the
arizona--
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
--court
has
decided
that
there
is
no
lesser
included
offense
of...
for
felony
murder
that
includes
second...
second
degree
or
the
lesser...
any
homicide.
there
is
no
second
degree
murder
as
a
lesser
of
actually
murder.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
under
the
arizona
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
wayne
ford
thank
you.
