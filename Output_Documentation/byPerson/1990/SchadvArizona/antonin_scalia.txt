justice
scalia
the
respondent
here
contends
that
robbery
is
not
indeed
a
lesser
included
offense
of
first
degree
murder
if
you
look
just
to
the
statutory
definitions.
justice
scalia
do...
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
scalia
well,
but
no,
you
could
have...
they
had
a
first
degree
murder
instruction.
that's
your
other
point.
justice
scalia
they
could
have
found
him
guilty
of
the
defined
offense,
first
degree
murder,
without
having
found
him
guilty
of
robbery,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
scalia
and
pursuant
to
our
prior
law
and
what
constitutes
a
lesser
included
offense,
that
wouldn't
suffice.
so
this
argument
of
yours,
in
a
way,
hinges
upon
your
first
argument
that
you
can't
define
first
degree
murder
that
generally
to
include
both
felony
murder
and
murder
with
intent.
justice
scalia
i
thought
we
just...
i
thought
we
just
went
through
that.
the
greater
offense
is
first
degree
murder
and
your
client
could
have
been
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
without
being
convicted
of
robbery.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
so
it's
not
necessarily
included.
justice
scalia
but
that's
the
offense.
justice
scalia
as
i
said.
justice
scalia
but
that's
just...
the
sentencing
phase.
but
just
to
be
clear
about
it,
there
is
no
arizona
crime
of
felony
murder?
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
defined
crime
was
first
degree
murder,
and
there
are
various
ways
of
proving
first
degree
murder.
but
there's
no
separate
penalty
denominated
for
felony
murder.
it's
just
one
way
of
showing
first
degree.
justice
scalia
so
i
think
your
answer
should
have
been
yes.
justice
scalia
he
can
be
tried
for
first
degree
murder
with
the
state
arguing
only
one
theory
of
first
degree
murder...
to
whit,
the
felony
theory...
if
the
state
wishes
to
proceed
that
way.
justice
scalia
but
they
are
not
required
elements.
you
don't
have
to
find
any
of
those
elements,
because
there
is
no
crime
of
premeditated
murder.
there
is
only
a
crime
of
first
degree
murder.
the
judge's
instructions
to
the
jury
said,
you
may
come
to
one
of
three
verdicts.
and
two
of
them
were
not
felony
murder
and
premeditated
murder.
first,
you
may
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree,
or
guilty...
or
not
guilty.
those
were
the
only
three
choices.
justice
scalia
which
is
this...
which
brings
you
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
the
person
had
to
break
into
the
house...
could
have
come
in
through
the
window
or
through
the
door.
either
one
would
satisfy
it.
justice
scalia
yeah,
a
break-in
is
an
essential
element.
justice
scalia
well,
i
assume--
justice
scalia
--i
assume
you
would
say
the
same
thing
if
we
granted
your...
your
claim
in
this
case.
the
next
step
would
be,
what
if
the
jury
disagrees
as
to
what
the
felony
was
in
felony
murder?
six
jurors
think
that
the
felony
was
attempted
rape.
six
jurors
think
that
it
was
robbery.
the
individual
can't
be
convicted.
is
that
right?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--all
right,
where...
where
do
you
stop.
i
mean
the
next
level
down,
there
are
various
ways
of...
of
robbery,
as
justice
kennedy
said.
and
where
does
it
all
end?
justice
scalia
well,
there
are
many
more
than
two
mental
states
required.
i
mean
there
are
as
many
mental
states
required
as
there
are
all
the
felonies
in
arizona
plus
one
more
for...
for
the
intentional
killing,
right?
justice
scalia
i
mean
every
felony
if
it's...
if
it
requires
mens
rea,
i
assume,
has
a
different
intent,
right?
so
there
are
as
many
intents
required
under
this
statute
as
there
are
felonies
in
arizona
you
say?
justice
scalia
well,
and
for...
and
for
this
first
degree
murder.
justice
scalia
that's...
that's
one
intent.
justice
scalia
and
then
there's
not
just
a
second,
which
is
an
intent
to
commit
a
felony.
you...
there's
a
different
intent
for
each
one
of
the
felonies,
right?
so
there
are
30
different
intents
here.
who
knows?
justice
scalia
but
you
had
12
who
believe
that
killed
the
person
and
12
who
believed
that
he
had
the
kind
of
intent
that
the
state
made
unlawful.
justice
scalia
are
you
sure?
justice
scalia
one
or
the
other
of
the
various
kinds
of
intent
that
the
state
made
unlawful.
justice
scalia
well,
how
far
does
that
go
toward
arizona...
just
abolish
all
of
its
specific
felonies
and
adopt
a
new
crime
called
a
generic
felony.
and
there
are
various
ways
you
can
prove
a
generic
felony.
you
can
prove
fellow
committed
homicide.
you
can
prove
he
committed
robbery.
you
can
prove
he
committed
burglary.
and
those
would
not
be
elements
of
the
crime.
the
crime
is
felony.
and
it
just
goes
to
the
jury.
and
you
say,
you
know,
you
figure
out
whether
he
did
any
one
of
these
things.
if
we
get
nine
of
you
to
think
he
did
nine
different
things,
we
got
him.
do
you
believe
that?
justice
scalia
you
can
do
it
for
homicide,
but
you
can't
go
above
homicide.
why
can't
you
just
do
it
for
a
felony?
the
crime
is
defined
as
felony.
and
you
tell
the
jury
you
can
find
that
he
committed
a
felony
in
various...
in
various
ways,
just
as
the
prosecutor
here
directed
them.
you
can
find
that
he
committed
homicide.
you
can
find
that
he
committed
robbery.
you
can
find
that
he's
a
tax
cheat...
whatever.
if
i...
you
know,
if
i
can
pick
up
nine
votes
for
one
or
the
other,
i
have
a
conviction.
can
you
do
that?
justice
scalia
i
told
you
how
it's
written.
justice
scalia
it's
a
felony.
justice
scalia
well,
take
homicide...
i
think
you're
getting
confused
by
homicide.
take
homicide
out
of
it.
justice
scalia
it's
a...
it's
a
new
crime
called
a
nonhomicide
felony,
and
it
includes
every
felony
in
the
world
except
homicide.
justice
scalia
all
right?
but
they
are
not
elements
of
it.
they
are
just
like
the
two
elements
of
intent
in
this
statute.
could
arizona
do
that?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
now,
why
is
this
different?
how
do
you...
how
do
you
draw
the
line
between
that
statute
and
the
one
you're
defending
here?
justice
scalia
xxx--
--i
didn't
understand...
i
understood
you
to
ask...
[inaudible]
i
misunderstood
your
answer.
i
thought
you...
you
overtly
appealed
to
tradition
which
is
okay
with
me.
i
mean,
i'm
big
on
tradition.
but
i
thought
you
basically
said
that
my
generic
statute
is
no
good,
because
we've
just
never
done
things
that
way.
and
you
say
we've
always
done
it
this
way
for
first
degree
murder.
and
i
must
say
i
have
to
take
your
word
for
it.
i
don't
recall
any
lengthy
discussion
in
your
brief
about
how
common
this
practice
is
in
other
states.
is
it...
has
it
been
done
this
way
for
a
long
time?
is
it
generally
done
this
way
in
other
states?
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
not
the
generic
felony.
first
degree
murder,
which
can
include
either
felony
murder
or...
or...
or
intent.
justice
scalia
and
this
could
happen,
you
assert,
in
any
state?
the
same
conviction
could
possibly
come
in
with
a
6-6
split
on
the
jury?
six
thinking
that
a
felony
murder
had
been
committed
and
six
thinking
there
was...
there
was
intent
to
kill...
premeditated
intent.
