ms.
denise
i.
young
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
edward
schad
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
after
a
trial
at
which
the
evidence
presented
was
that
the
victim
was
strangled,
and
that
sometime
later
mr.
schad
had
possession
of
some
of
the
victim's
property.
two
rules
arizona
mechanically
applied
in
mr.
schad's
case
allowed
the
prosecution
to
obtain
this
verdict
based
on
this
then
evidence.
the
question...
both
issues
presented
in
this
case
presents
is
whether
that
verdict
obtained
by
the
rigid
application
of
these
two
rules
is
constitutionally
reliable.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
although
i'm
going
to
discuss
each
rule
separately,
that
is
not
how
they
worked
at
mr.
schad's
capital
trial.
these
two
rules,
arizona's
one
form
of
verdict
rule
and
arizona's
no
lesser
included
offenses
for
felony
murder
rule
worked
together,
mutually
reinforcing
one
another
and
increasing
the
risk
that
the
verdict
returned
against
mr.
schad
was
erroneous.
i
will
first
address
the
second
issue
we
present
in
our
brief,
arizona's
rule
that
there
are
no
lesser
included
offenses
of
felony
murder,
because
it
presents
a
more
narrow
constitutional
issue
and
it
is
controlled
by
beck
v.
alabama.
the
prosecutor's
case
for
felony
murder
was
built
circumstantially.
no
direct
evidence
tied
mr.
schad
to
the
homicide
of
the
victim.
the
only
evidence
connecting
him
to
that
crime
was
his
possession
of
the
victim's
property.
the
prosecutor
argued
that
because
he
had
possession
of
the
property,
the
jury
could
find
that
he
robbed
the
victim
and
that
he
killed
the
victim
during
the
course
of
that
robbery,
and
was
therefore
guilty
of
felony
murder.
the
defense
used
that
same
evidence
to
argue
their
defense
that,
because
he
had
possession
of
the
property
but
because
there
was
no
evidence
directly
tieing
him
to
the
homicide,
that
perhaps
the
jury
could
find
him
a
thief,
perhaps
a
robber,
but
not
a
murderer.
because
of
arizona's
mandatory
rule
precluding
lesser
included
offenses
for
felony
murder,
the
judge
refused
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
offense
of
robbery
or
on
the
offense
of
theft,
which
under
arizona
law
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
robbery.
ms.
denise
i.
young
the
judge
did
give
an
instruction
for
second
degree
murder
which
was
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
for
premeditated
murder.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
beck
requires
that
the
jury
be
given
all
rational
lesser
included
offenses
where
supported
by
the
evidence.
now
that
is
not
as
broad
as
it
may
seem.
beck
of
course
is
limited
to
capital
cases.
and
a
state
can
define
its
offenses
in
such
a
manner
that
they
are
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
greater
offense.
but
that's
not
what
arizona
did
here.
mr.
schad
was
tried
for
felony
murder
based
a
killing
which
occurred
during
the
course
of
the...
of
a
robbery.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
find
mr.
schad
guilty
of
felony
murder
if
it
found
that
he
robbed
the
victim
and
that
a
killing
occurred
during
the
course
of
that
robbery.
as
instructed,
felony
murder
incorporated
all
of
the
elements
of
robbery.
the
state
could
not
prove
its
case
of
felony
murder
here
without
inescapably
proving
robbery.
but
the
jury
was
not
given
the
option
to
return
that
verdict
because
of
arizona's
mandatory
rule...
here
not
different
than
the
rule
in
beck
v.
alabama.
ms.
denise
i.
young
your
honor,
i
just--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--because,
your
honor,
of
the
principle
that
beck
was
based
on
which
was
eliminating
the
distortion
in
the
fact-finding
process
and
ensuring
the
integrity
and
reliability
of
the
verdict.
in
the
beck
situation,
the
fact-finding
process
was
distorted,
because
the
jury
was
not
able
to
consider
a
lesser
included
noncapital,
homicide
offense.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor,
but
also
giving
them
an
option
to
return
a
rational
verdict.
beck
is
based
on
rationalizing
the
fact-finding
process,
not
derationalizing
the
fact-finding
process.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
right,
your
honor.
felony
murder
as
defined
by
arizona
law
has
two
elements,
a
killing
occurring
during
the
course
of
some
statutorily
enumerated
felony...
here,
robbery.
those
jurors
here
who
had
a
doubt
as
to
whether
mr.
schad
had
anything
to
do
with
the
killing...
and
that
was
the
very
factual
issue
in
dispute
here,
and
there
was
considerable
doubt
here
whether
he
did...
were
unable
to
return
a
verdict
consistent
with
that
doubt,
which
is
exactly
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
beck,
concerned
about
letting
the
jury
have
a
rational
option
if
they
are
not
convinced
that
all
of
the
elements
of
the
greater
offense
have...
have
been
committed.
because
of
the
substantial
risk
where
the
jury
believes
that
one
of
the
elements
has
not
been
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
that
they
do
believe
the
defendant
is
clearly
guilty
of
some
wrong
doing
as
occurred
here,
there
really
was
very
little
question
that
mr.
schad
done
something.
he
did
have
possess
of
the
victim's
property.
the
beck
court...
this
court
recognized
in
beck
that
there
was
a
substantial
risk
that
such
a
jury
would
convict...
would
resolve
its
doubts
in
favor
of
conviction
rather
than...
not...
excuse
me...
not
because
it
was
convinced
of
the
defendant's
guilt,
but
simply
it
did
not
want
to
let
the
defendant
go
free.
this
case
presents
a
preclusion
rule
no
different
than
beck.
and
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
of
mr.
schad
on
that
basis
because
this
jury
was
not
able
to
return
that
verdict.
and
we
must
remember
here
that
the
prosecution
based
its
theory
of
felony
murder
on
robbery,
told
the
jury
this
is
the
premise
of
the
felony
murder,
and
then
wiped
out
their
option
by...
of
returning
a
verdict
consistent
with
that
premise
because
of
arizona's
mandatory
rule.
the
second
issue
that
we
bring
here
today--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
right,
your
honor,
you
do
not.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
the
state
contends
here.
ms.
denise
i.
young
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
here,
mr.
schad
was
tried
for
felony
murder
based
on
a
robbery.
felony
murder
could
not
have
been
found
by
that
jury
without
it
finding
the
elements
of
robbery.
this
jury
was
instructed
on
the
elements
of
robbery
so
that
they
were
able
to
return
a
felony
murder
instruction.
so
they
had
the
elements
of
robbery.
they
were
instructed
on
that.
they
had
the
felony
murder
instruction
allowing
them
to
return
that
verdict.
as
instructed,
robbery
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor,
they
could
have.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
under
arizona
law,
a
lesser
included
offense
is
an
offense
where
the
greater
offense
cannot
be
committed
without
committing
the
lesser
offense
and
where
the
evidence
supports
a
lesser
offense.
here,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
and--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
in
the
overall
scheme
of
first
degree
murder
that's--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
true,
your
honor,
which...
which
brings
us
to
our
second
issue,
of
course.
ms.
denise
i.
young
but...
but
this
jury
was
not
just...
they
weren't
given
an
instruction
of
this
is
just
first
degree
murder.
they
were
given
instruction
of
first
degree
murder
is
either
premeditated
murder
or
felony
murder
and
let
me
tell
you
what
murder
is.
they
were
then
instructed
on
that.
ms.
denise
i.
young
no,
your
honor,
felony
murder
is
basically
a
strict
liability
offense
in
arizona.
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
play
any
part
in
the
killing
whatsoever.
it's
just
a
killing
occurs
during
the
course
of
a
felony.
ms.
denise
i.
young
the--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--no,
your
honor.
now,
there
was
a
instruction
for
premeditated
murder
that
he
must
have
caused
it.
ms.
denise
i.
young
not
for
felony
murder.
ms.
denise
i.
young
not
in
arizona.
ms.
denise
i.
young
at
the
penalty
phase
it
is
performed
by
a
judge.
we
have
judge
sentencing
only.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor,
he
must,
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
the
death
sentence,
make
an
inman-tison
finding.
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
at
the
sentencing
phase.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
there
is
an
arizona
crime
of
felony
murder,
and
arizona
tries
defendants
often
on...
just
based
on
felony
murder...
just
as
arizona
defines--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--it's...
it's
under
the
first
degree
murder
degree
statute.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
but--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--a
defendant
can
be
tried
in
arizona
only
for
felony
murder,
though.
a
defendant
can
be
tried
in
arizona
only
for
premeditated
murder.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
that
question
of
course
brings
us
to
the
second
issue...
our
first
issue
actually
in
our
brief.
the--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
we
must
win
on
this
issue
in
order
to
win
on
the
first
at
all.
the
second
rule
that
arizona
applied
in
mr.
schad's
case
is
the
one
form
of
verdict
rule
that
we
have
been
discussing.
that
rule
applies
in
a
capital
case
whenever
a
prosecutor
seeks
a
first
degree
murder
instruction
based
on
either
premeditated
murder
or
felony
murder.
when
a
prosecutor
invokes
that
rule,
he
eliminates
the
defendant's
right
under
the
constitution
in
arizona
to
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
this
is
how
that
rule
worked
in
mr.
schad's
capital
trial.
the
prosecutor
had
only
two
facts
on
which
to
obtain
a
conviction
here.
the
victim
was
strangled,
and
mr.
schad
later
had
possession
of
some
of
the
victim's
property.
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that
it
could
find
mr.
schad
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
if
it
found
either
premeditated
murder
or
felony
murder
and
that
there
were
two
different,
factual
routes
that
the
jury
could
take
in
order
to
reach
a
conviction
on
each
of
those
crimes.
the
prosecutor
first
argued
the
premeditation
route.
he
told
the
jury
that
he
could
find...
that
they
could
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
premeditated
murder
if
it
found
one
fact...
excuse
me...
based
on
one
fact,
that
the
victim
was
strangled.
the
prosecutor
argued
that
that
fact
alone
showed
he
premeditated
the
crime.
the
prosecutor
then
argued
an
entirely
different
factual
route
for
the
jury
to
reach
the
other
crime,
the
crime
of
felony
murder.
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that
they
could
find
mr.
schad
guilty
of
felony
murder
based
on
a
completely
separate
fact,
that
mr.
schad
had
possession
of
the
victim's
property.
he
must
have
robbed
him
then.
and
he
must
have
killed
him
during
that
robbery.
the
jury
was
told
that
they
only
had
to
return
a
verdict
of
first
degree
murder,
and
that
either
premeditated
murder
or
felony
murder
constituted
first
degree
murder.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
different.
ms.
denise
i.
young
here
the
difference
are
the
completely
separate
factual
routes
that
the
jury
must
take
in
order
to
establish
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--but...
but
the
crime
of
burglary
requires
entering
into
a
struction
without
a
legal--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--but
let's
look
at
how
arizona
defines
these
crimes.
arizona
defines
premeditated
murder
to
have
three
elements...
that
the
defendant
killed,
that
he
did
so
with
malice
intent,
and
that
he
did
so
with
premeditation.
those
are
the
elements
arizona
has
chosen
to
make
essential
to
the
crime
of
premeditated
murder.
ms.
denise
i.
young
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
of
course,
arizona
can...
can
draft
its
statute
this
way.
but
once
it
has
set
up
those
elements,
winship
requires
that
the
jury
find
each
of
those
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
facts
supporting
each
of
those
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
how
are
they
able
to
find
that
conviction?
we
have
to
go
back
to
look
at
what
the
elements
were
that
the
prosecution
had
to
establish
and
the
jury
had
to
find.
now,
here--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
not
an
essential
element
required.
here
the
essential
elements
required--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes,
but
not
breaking
and
entering
by
one
certain
means.
ms.
denise
i.
young
by
break--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
unanimously?
ms.
denise
i.
young
well,
your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
the
case.
ms.
denise
i.
young
it
would
depend
on
the
facts.
ms.
denise
i.
young
--of
the
case.
if
in
fact
the
facts
of
the
case
were
such
that
they...
there
weren't
the
two
possibilities
but
that
he
just
entered,
then,
no,
the
jury...
the
prosecution
would
have
presented
the
case
in
such
a
manner
that
the
jury
could
have
only
found
one
way.
but
once
you
must...
once
the
law...
the
state
law
has
defined
the
crime
in
such
a
way
that
there
are
different
elements
that
the
prosecutor
can
rely
on,
different
facts
to
establish
those
elements,
the
jury
must
choose
which
way.
ms.
denise
i.
young
your
honor,
if
the...
if
the
burglary
required
that
the
jury
have
to
choose
one
of...
if
the
elements
of
burglary
were
such
that,
like
the
elements
of
premeditated
murder
and
felony
murder,
the
jury
must
choose
one
of
the
two,
then
yes,
i
would
agree
that
they
would
have
to
unanimously
find
that.
ms.
denise
i.
young
if...
if
the
elements
defined
by
state
law
and...
i
don't
have
the
elements
of
burglary...
but
if
the
elements
defined
by
state
law
required
them
to
do
so,
then
yes,
that
they
had
to
choose,
then
yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
no,
i...
arizona
does
not
and
that's
why
we're
here.
ms.
denise
i.
young
but
that's
the
problem.
arizona
should.
once
it
has
defined
these
two
crimes
in
the
way
it
has
with
the
essential
elements
of
premeditation
on
this
side...
and
the
prosecutor
argued
the
case
this
way
to
the
jury.
he
outlined
the
elements
on
the
blackboard
to
the
jury.
here
they
are,
three
elements
of
premeditated
murder.
here's
how
you
find
it.
ms.
denise
i.
young
he
strangled
the
victim.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
it
can
end
with
the
capital
case.
it
can
end
at
the
first
degree
murder
statute.
it
does
not
need
to
go
any
further
than
that.
but
the
way--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that
is--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--you
might,
but
that's...
i
think
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
would
have
to--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
right.
that's
right.
ms.
denise
i.
young
but...
but
there
are,
your
honor.
under...
as
arizona
has
defined
felony
murder,
there
certainly
are
two
different
mental
states.
the
mental
state
for
felony
murder
has
nothing
to
do...
no
connection
whatsoever
to
the
homicide.
it
is
a
mental
state
for
the
underlying
felony
that
cannot
be
substituted
over
here
for
the
premeditation
when
the
jury
may
have
found
that
mr.
schad
had
no
involvement
in
the
killing.
ms.
denise
i.
young
for
the
premeditated
murder--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--intents...
intents
that
the
statute
has
required
for
that
particular
felony,
that's
right.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
right.
we
know
what
the...
we
know
what
the
mental
state
is
for
that,
of
course...
the
intent
and
the
premeditation
for
the...
the
premeditated
murder.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
there
could
be.
but...
but
this
is
not
a
great
burden
we're
asking
the
state
to
take
on.
all
we're
asking
is
that
they
give
the
jury
separate
forms
of
verdict.
ms.
denise
i.
young
they...
they--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--if
in
fact
the
evidence
is
such
that
it
is,
they
do
have
to
unanimously
agree
on
the
facts
essential
to
that
crime.
and
if
those
facts
are
so
disparate
as
they
are
here
and
can
establish
such
two
entirely
different
crimes
as
they
do
here--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--no,
i--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--i
do
not
know
that
to
be
so,
your
honor.
i
know
that
there's
been
at
least
no
decision
out
of
this
court
along
those
lines.
the
circuit
courts
have
come
out
various
ways
when
in
fact
they
were
faced
with
the
statute
that
the
jury
could
have
understood
required...
the...
the...
them
to
go
off
on...
the
jury
to
go
off
on
two
separate
factual
routes
as
it
did
here.
but
the
prosecution
here
can
certainly
argue
11
different
ways
if
that's
how
you
want
to
look
at
this
case.
we
believe...
it's
our
position
that
these
are
two
separate
crimes
regardless
of
what
arizona
calls
it.
but
the
prosecution
can
throw
out
11
different
ways
for
the
jury
to
find
first
degree
murder.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
that
jury
unanimously
agree
on
which
one
it
is.
here
we've
got
a
case
where
six
jurors
may
have
believed
that
felony
murder
was
committed.
and
you
can't
look
at
this
case
in
isolation.
remember
they
were
given
the
opportunity
to
return
anything
else
if
they
had
a
doubt.
but
six
jurors
may
have
believe
felony
murder
was
committed,
and
six
jurors
may
have
disbelieved
that.
you
had
as
many
believing
that...
that
crime
as
disbelieving.
ms.
denise
i.
young
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
you
did.
ms.
denise
i.
young
first
of
all,
if...
if
six--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--no,
your
honor,
if
the
six
people
who
believe
felony
murder...
and
setting
aside
the
beck
issue
for
a
while...
those
six
people
may
not
have
had...
believed
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
killing
but
simply
was
present
during
a
robbery.
that
is
far
different
from
the
other
six
jurors
who
believed
there
was
premeditation.
ms.
denise
i.
young
on
either
premeditated
murder
or
felony
murder?
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
under
arizona
law,
the
constitution
requires
that
their
verdict
be
unanimous.
ms.
denise
i.
young
a
united
states
supreme
court
case?
no,
no,
there's
no
case
by
this
court
that
it
must
be.
there
are
certainly
circuit
court
cases...
the
gipson
case--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--okay.
ms.
denise
i.
young
well,
the
possibility
that
the
jury
here
split
evenly--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--even
violates
this
court's
minimum
requirements.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
your
honor,
or--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--at
least
a
majority.
here
we
have
them
splitting
evenly.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's...
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
we
have
no
idea
here
what
the
jury
did.
thank
you.
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
denise
i.
young
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
exactly
our
point
on
the
beck
issue,
that
this
jury
had
no
rational
option
if
they
did
have
a
rational
doubt
about
one
of
the
elements
of
felony
murder.
and
the
supreme
court,
when
it
reviewed
this
issue,
and
it
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix,
found
that
the
evidence
would
have
supported
a
verdict
for
robbery.
but
that
this
jury
was
not
given
that
option
to
return
that
verdict
because
of
the
preclusion
rule.
i
also
want
to
very
quickly
state
that,
contrary
to
what
mr.
ford
said,
the
prosecutor
in
this
trial
very
clearly
argued
the
different
factual
routes,
and
we
have
set
out
that
portion
of
the
argument
in
our
joint
appendix
at
page
6
and
7.
