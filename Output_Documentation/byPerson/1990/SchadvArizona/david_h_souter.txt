justice
souter
but
doesn't...
doesn't
that
then
just
raise
the
further
question,
why...
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
analyze
the
arizona
statute
as
simply
requiring
a
guilty
mental
state
which
may
be
proven
either
as
premeditation
or
may
be
proven
as
a
element
in
the
intent
to
commit
robbery
in
the
course
of
which
there
is
a
killing?
your
argument
depends
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
two
different
mental
states
involved,
and
hence
two
different
elements.
if
we
don't
accept
that
assumption,
then
your
argument
falls.
justice
souter
in
effect,
you're...
you're
saying
then
that
if
there's
a
6-6
split
on
how
it's
committed,
we
don't
have
a
due
process
problem
keyed
to
reasonable
doubt?
we
do
not
have
to
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
can't
have
reasonable...
you
can't
have
a
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
even
though
there's
a...
there's
a
split
6
to
6.
but
if
we
got
a
greater
number
of
fractioned
possibilities...
if
we
maybe
got
three-three-three-three,
it
would
be
an
implication
for
reasonable
doubt.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
well,
i
guess
then...
let
me
if
i
may
just
ask
you
one
other
question,
and
that
is
when...
when
you
were...
when
were
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
he
said,
well,
what
is
the
due
process
implication
that
bothers
you
in
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
in
which
there
might
be,
you
know,
30
ways
to
commit
the
generic
felony.
and
i
thought
you
said
that
the
due
process
concern
that
you
had
was
somehow
keyed
to
the
concept
of
reasonable
doubt.
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
there.
justice
souter
and...
and
weren't
you
saying...
i
guess
i
misunderstood
you...
weren't
you
in
effect
saying
that
in...
in
a
system
in
which
there
might
be
12
different
theories,
one
for
each
juror
about
how
the
generic
felony
had
been
committed,
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
would
not
be
satisfied.
wasn't
that
what
you
were
in
effect
saying?
justice
souter
okay,
why
is
that
so
when
there
would
be
a
question
about
it
on
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
in
which
we
might
have
12
different
theories
within
the
jury
about
how
the
crime
was
committed?
justice
souter
right,
and
that
means
that
among
12
jurors...
in
theory
12
jurors
might
come
to
12
different
views
about
how...
one
juror
might
say,
well,
you
know,
this
fellow
robbed.
another
one
might
say,
no,
he
simply
received
stolen
property.
and
a
third
might
say
he
was
reckless
driving
and
so
on.
i
thought...
i
thought
that
possibility
was
what
implicated
the
reasonable
doubt
concern
that
you
had
raised.
justice
souter
okay,
and
you're
now
saying
that
when
there
are
only
two
possibilities,
so
that
the
worst
that
we
might
have
would
be
six
jurors
feeling
one
method,
six
another.
that
does
not
have
the
same
implications
for
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
justice
souter
let
me...
let
me
just
get
the
terminology
right.
the
common
element
is
what?
premeditation?
no.
justice
souter
what
is
the
common
element
for
first
degree
murder?
justice
souter
it's
the...
it's
the
killing
with
malice?
justice
souter
the
malice
may
be
supplied
by
premeditation
or
it
may
be
supplied
by
the
intent
to
commit
the
felony?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder
in
the
strangling
of
a
74-year-old
man
after
he
was
found
in
possession
of
the
man’s
car
and
other
belongings.
in
arizona
or
as
in
many
states,
first
degree
murder
may
be
committed
by
premeditation
or
in
the
course
of
committing
a
serious
felony.
at
the
trial,
the
prosecutor
advanced
theories
both
of
premeditated
murder
and
felony
murder.
whereas,
the
petitioner
claimed
that
the
evidence
showed
at
most
that
he
was
a
thief,
not
a
murderer.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jurors
on
first
degree
murder
by
premeditation
or
on
the
course
of
a
felony
and
on
the
lesser
included
offense
of
second
degree
murder.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death.
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
affirmed
rejecting
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
not
requiring
the
jury
to
agree
on
a
single
theory
of
first
degree
murder
rather
than
allowing
them
to
combine
findings
of
either
premeditated
or
felony
murder.
the
court
also
rejected
the
argument
that
beck
v.
alabama
required
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
included
offense
of
robbery.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
first
that
beck
did
not
entitle
petitioner
to
a
jury
instruction
on
robbery.
beck
held
unconstitutional
an
alabama
statute
prohibiting
lesser
included
defense
instructions
in
capital
cases.
it
was
based
on
a
concern
that
a
jury
convinced
that
the
defendant
had
committed
some
violent
crime
but
not
convinced
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
capital
offense
might
nonetheless
vote
for
a
capital
conviction
if
the
only
alternative
was
to
set
the
defendant
free
with
no
penalty
at
all.
this
concern
is
not
implicated
here
because
the
jury
was
given
a
third
option
of
convicting
petitioner
of
the
non-capital
offense
of
second
degree
murder
and
nonetheless
found
him
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
it
would
be
irrational
to
assume
that
the
jury
might
have
chosen
capital
murder
rather
than
second
degree
murder
as
its
means
of
keeping
a
robber
off
the
street.
there
is,
thus,
no
reason
to
doubt
the
reliability
of
the
capital
murder
verdict.
second,
in
an
opinion
in
which
i
am
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
o’connor,
and
justice
kennedy,
we
conclude
that
arizona’s
characterization
of
first
degree
murder
is
a
single
crime
as
to
which
the
jury
need
not
agree
on
one
of
the
alternative
theories
of
premeditated
or
felony
murder
is
not
unconstitutional.
that
there
is
a
long
established
rule
that
a
jury
need
not
agree
on
which
overt
act,
among
several,
was
the
means
by
which
a
crime
was
committed
and
we
think
the
same
is
true
as
to
different
means
of
satisfying
the
mens
rea
element
of
the
crime
which
is
at
issue
here.
the
due
process
clause,
however,
does
place
limits
on
a
state’s
capacity
to
define
different
courses
of
conduct
or
states
of
mind
as
merely
alternative
means
of
committing
a
single
offense.
there
is
point
at
which
differences
between
the
means
become
so
important
that
they
may
not
be
viewed
merely
as
alternatives
to
a
common
end
but
must
be
treated
as
differentiating
between
what
the
constitution
requires
to
be
treated
as
separate
offenses
requiring
separate
jury
findings.
because
there
is
no
a
priori
standard
for
determining
the
point
at
which
different
means
must
be
treated
as
reaching
independent
ends,
the
inquiry
must
be
taken
with
a
threshold
presumption
of
legislative
competence
as
indicated
by
our
burden-shifting
cases
such
as
patterson
and
new
york.
we
also
find
it
significant
here
that
arizona’s
treatment
of
premeditated
and
felony
murder
is
mere
means
of
establishing
a
single
offense
subject
to
a
general
verdict
find
substantial,
historical,
and
contemporary
echoes.
we
have
confidence
that
state
criminal
definitions
and
practices
will
not
retain
wide
acceptance
over
time
if
they
conflict
with
notions
of
fairness
and
rationality
sufficiently
fundamental
to
be
comprehended
in
due
process.
finally,
we
note
that
the
mental
state
necessary
for
premeditated
murder
and
not
necessary
for
felony
murder
can
reasonably
be
considered
equivalent
as
established
by
our
cases,
such
as
tison
and
arizona.
this
is
enough
to
rule
out
the
argument
that
a
moral
disparity
bars
treating
the
two
mental
states
merely
as
alternative
means
of
satisfying
the
mental
element
of
the
single
offense.
although
the
foregoing
considerations
may
not
exhaust
the
universe
of
considerations
potentially
relevant,
they
are
sufficient
to
persuade
us
that
the
jury’s
options
in
this
case
did
not
fall
beyond
the
constitutional
bounds
of
fundamental
fairness
and
rationality.
