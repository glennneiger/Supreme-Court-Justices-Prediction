justice
white
wasn't
that...
wasn't
the...
beck
was
confined
to
capital
cases,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
so
it
was
to
give
the
jury
an
option
to
imposing
the
death
penalty.
justice
white
well,
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
needn't
reach
your
second
issue?
justice
white
well,
what
about
the
penalty
phase?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
what's...
what
must
he
find?
that
the
defendant
killed
or
intended
to
have
a
killing?
justice
white
but
that's
after
sentencing
phase.
justice
white
well,
i'll
ask
it
later
i
guess,
whether
you
must
win
on
this
in
order
to
win
on
the
first.
justice
white
but
do
you
think
arizona
requires
the
jury
to
choose
between
premeditation?
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
do
you...
do
you
say
that
it
must
be
clear
that
the
jury
was
unanimous
on
each...
on
whatever
theory
that...
on
one
theory
or
the
other?
justice
white
what
is...
what
is
your
case
that
says
that,
in
a
state
case,
there
must
unanimous
verdicts?
justice
white
i
know,
but
do
you
have
any
case
here
that
says
it
must
be
unanimous?
justice
white
well,
what
makes
it...
let's
assume
that
there's...
that
there's
a
clear
rule
here
that...
that...
that
there
may
not
be
unanimous
verdicts
in
the
state
criminal
cases,
including
capital
cases.
let's
just
assume
that.
justice
white
but
arizona
requires
it.
on
what
ground
would
you
then
say
we
should
reverse
this
case?
it's
just
because
arizona
has
this
rule,
but
is
it
unconstitutional
to
have
a...
in
a...
for
arizona
to
do
it
this
way?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
that's...
you
really
get
down
to
a
6
to
6
thing
then?
justice
white
it
would
have
to
be
a
majority.
justice
white
well,
mr.
ford,
suppose
that
arizona
did
have
a
third
valid
and
they
want...
they
want
the
jury
to
say
what
the
verdict
is.
and
it
turns
out
that
six
jurors
thought...
voted
on
premeditated
murder
and
six
on
felony
murder.
would...
would
the
judge
then
enter
a
verdict
of
guilty?
justice
white
six
and
six?
justice
white
so,
so...
so
you're...
you're
quite
content
with
the
assumption
that
six
on
one
and
six
on
the
other
would
still
produce
a
guilty
verdict
constitutionally?
justice
white
because...
and
you
would
say
the
state
law
rule
of
unanimity
is
satisfied,
because
there's
12
people
who
voted
for
first
degree
murder?
justice
white
yeah,
but
the
statutes
may
be
that
way,
but
how
about
the
practice
of
submitting
separate
verdict
forms?
do
you
think
that's
done
everywhere?
justice
white
no,
and
your
supreme
court
even
says
it's
a
good
idea
to
do
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
nevertheless
it
says
go
ahead
and
do
it.
justice
white
what
about
other
jurisdictions?
what
about
in
the
federal
practice?
justice
white
and
deserves
the
death
penalty.
justice
white
but
you
may
not
be
able
to
impose
the
death
penalty
without
proof
of
that
element...
without
proof
of
intent.
justice
white
what
is
second
degree
murder
that...
there
was
an
instruction
on
second
degree
murder?
justice
white
what
is
that?
justice
white
well,
what...
so
to
get
to
that,
you
would
have
to
say
no
felony
murder...
no
premeditated
murder,
no
felony
murder...
but
murder.
justice
white
well,
they...
but
they
would
have
to
find
him
not
guilty
of
either
premeditated
or
felony
murder
in
order
to
hold
him
guilty...
to
let
him
off
with
second
degree
murder?
justice
white
as
a
matter
of
law
under
arizona
law
and
under
those
instructions.
justice
white
well,
they...
yeah,
but
the
instructions
said
if
you
don't
find
him
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
you
may
find
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
justice
white
well,
to
find
him
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
you
would
have
to
say
he
wasn't...
they
weren't
guilty
of
either
premeditated
or
felony
murder.
justice
white
what's
the
penalty
for
second
degree
murder?
justice
white
5
to
15?
justice
white
what
was
the
penalty
for
robbery?
the
felony
of
robbery?
justice
white
well,
if
they...
if
there
was
proof
in
the
question
of
robbery...
of
course
in
a
lot
of
felony
murders
i
suppose
you
can
prove
who
killed
him?
justice
white
and
if
there's
proof
that...
of
the...
if
the
jury
believes
that
there
was
not
only
a
robbery,
but
this
defendant
killed
him,
would
they
give
him
second
degree
murder?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
that's
the
way
it
is?
justice
white
so
it's
only
a
second
degree
to
premeditated?
