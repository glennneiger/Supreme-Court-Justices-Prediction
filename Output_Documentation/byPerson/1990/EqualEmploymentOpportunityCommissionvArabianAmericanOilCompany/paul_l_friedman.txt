mr.
paul
l.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
we
also
agree
with
him
that
what
is
involved
here
is
what
he
today
has
referred
to
as
the
well-established
presumption
against
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
laws.
but
we
think
there
are
several
problems,
at
least
five,
before
one
even
gets
to
the
presumption,
with
his
position.
one
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
says
nothing
about
an
extraterritorial
reach.
second
is
the
legislative
history,
which
says
nothing
about
foreign
work
places,
nothing
about
extraterritoriality.
and
there
is
no
indication
in
that
legislative
history,
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
441
witnesses
who
testified,
that
anybody
thought
this
was
going
to
apply
overseas.
third,
the
structure
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
talk
only
in
terms
of
a
domestic
focus
of
the
act.
fourth,
as
justice
scalia's
questions
suggest,
there
really
is
no
principled
basis
to
limit
this
statute
to
u.s.
employers
overseas
once
you
start
down
that
road.
fifth,
to
apply
it
overseas
runs
afoul
of
prerogatives
and
sovereignty
of
other
nations
and
with
international
conventions.
and
then
you
get
to
the
presumption
which
says
that
congress
must
speak
clearly,
expressly,
and
affirmatively
if
it
intends
a
statute
to
apply
overseas.
now
i,
i
think
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
be
saying
either
that
the
alien
exemption
provision
itself
grants
coverage
to
u.s.
citizens
overseas
by
a
negative
inference,
or
he
may
be
saying
that
it
is
the
commerce
language
which
grants
coverage
to
everybody,
and
then
the
alien
exemption
provision
withdraws
it
from
aliens.
if
it
is
the
latter,
which
is
strongly
suggested...
stated...
in
his
reply
brief,
we
run
into
the
very
problems
that
the
court
was
discussing
with
the
solicitor
general
a
few
moments
ago.
the
commerce
language
"between
a
state
and
any
place
outside
thereof.
"
is
found
in
numerous
other
statutes,
and
this
court
and
no
other
court
has
ever
said
that
those
statutes
apply
overseas.
it
is
found,
for
example,
in
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act.
it
is
found
in
the
recently
passed
americans
with
disabilities
act.
it
is
found
in
at
least
a
dozen
other
statutes,
including
all
of
those
that
we
list
in
footnote
17
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
the
language,
commerce
between
a
state
and
any
other...
and
any
foreign
nation,
which
arguably
is
broader
or
suggests
a
stronger
indication
that
congress
may
have
intended
what
the
solicitor
general
argues,
is
not
found
in
this
statute,
but
it
is
found
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
on
which
this
statute
was
patterned,
in
the
labor
management
relations
act,
on
which
this
statute
was
patterned,
and
this
court
has
said
that
neither
of
those
apply
extraterritorially.
it
is
also
found
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
the
railway
labor
act,
and
even
title
ii,
the
public
accommodation
section
of
the
civil
rights
act.
those
statutes,
and
chisholm
and
air
line
stewards
and
some
other
cases,
have
been
held
not
to
apply
extraterritorially.
of
course,
no
one
has
ever
suggested,
to
my
knowledge,
that
the
public
accommodation
section
does.
so
we
suggest
that
his
position
is
a
troublesome
one
if
he
is
relying
on
the
notion
that
this
commerce
language
alone
provides
jurisdiction.
now,
if
he's
saying
something
beyond
that,
which
he
also
seems
to
be
saying
in
his
brief,
that
this
statute
is
an
example
of
congress
legislating
on
the
nationality
principle.
it
wasn't
entirely
clear
in
the
various
earlier
portions
of
this
case
and
maybe
even
in
some
of
the
solicitor
general's
earlier
submissions
to
this
court,
but
it
is
now
clear
that
he's
relying
on
the
nationality
principle.
the
nationality
principle
is
a
disfavored
basis
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
it
applies
usually
in
matters
of
allegiance,
like
military
service
and
taxation,
when
we
reach
overseas
to
reach
our
nationals.
and
every
time
congress
has
chosen
to
legislate
on
that
principle,
it
has
used
the
words
expressly:
u.s.
citizen
or
u.s.
person
or
u.s.
national.
i
believe
it
did
so,
except
in
the
department
of
defense
statute
in...
cited
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
of
course
the
department
of
defense
is
a
u.s.
person,
in
every
single
statute
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
reply
brief
at
footnote
13
on
page
16.
with
respect
to
anti-discrimination
statutes,
the
only
cases
that
i
am
aware
of
in
which
congress
has
chosen
to
reach
into
foreign
work
places
are
the
export
administration
act,
the
comprehensive
anti-apartheid
act,
and
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
where
congress,
in
each
case,
spoke
about
u.s.
persons,
u.s.
nationals,
or,
in
the
case
of
the
amended
anti...
age
discrimination
act,
american
employers.
and
so,
regardless
of
whether
you
approach
it
on
the
commerce
language
approach
or
on
the
notion
that
congress
acted
affirmatively
somehow,
it
hasn't
done
it
in
a
way
that
this
court
has
accepted
that
congress
must
do
it
in
order
to
reach
into
foreign
territory.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
justice
o'connor,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
presumption
and
steele
somewhat
separately.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
one
goes
back
to
the
early
cases
in
which
what
we
call
the
presumption
and
what
today
the
solicitor
general
called
the
presumption,
you
get
to
sandberg,
you
get
to
bowman,
and
those
cases...
blackmer.
and
the
court
said
legislation
is
presumptively
territorial.
it
said
that
failure
to
say
something
expressly
negatives
the
purpose
of
congress.
it
said
in
sandberg
that
we
don't
presume
congress
to
legislate
by
implication
when
a
few
affirmative
words
would
stand
for...
would
state
congress'
intention,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
when
you
get
to
foley,
and
benz
and
mcculloch,
and
foley
cited
blackmer
and
foley
cited
sandberg,
it
seems
to
me
that
foley
does
say...
and
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
it
was
a
u.s.
citizen
that
brought
that
suit...
foley
does
say
that,
that
it,
that
congress
must
express
its
intention
to
extend
coverage
beyond
places
where
the
united
states
has
sovereignty
or
some
measure
of
legislative
control,
and
there
was
no
indication
that
it
had
done
so
there.
the
fact
that
it
would
apply
equally
to
aliens
and
u.s.
citizens,
the
court
i
believe
said
only,
quote,
"buttresses
the
conclusion
of
the
court.
"
it
had
already
reached
its
conclusion.
and
we
say
that
it
did
so
on
the
basis
of
that
presumption,
or
the
canon,
it
used
the,
it
talked
about
it
as
canon
of
construction
in
that
case.
in
benz
and
mcculloch,
the
court
did
say
that
the
basic
question
was
whether
congress
had
written
the
act
and
intended
it
to
apply
overseas
and
required
an
affirmative
intention
of
congress
clearly
expressed,
at
least
in
the
mcculloch
case.
so
one
pieces
those
together
to
take
what
in
some
cases
was
called
a
canon
of
construction,
in
other
cases
a
presumption
and
an
assumption
that
congress
seeks
to
legislate
domestically,
and
comes
up
with
what
we
call
a
strong
presumption
and
i
think
the
solicitor
general
calls
a
well-established
presumption.
the
steele
and
lanham
act
question,
it
seems
to
me,
is
somewhat
separate.
and
it's
somewhat
separate
because
there
we're
dealing
not
with
the
nationality
principle,
but
with
the
effects
part
of
the
territoriality
principle.
and
the
congress,
to
the
extent
it
has
said
it
is
doing
so,
and
this
court
and
the
second
circuit
in
alcoa,
for
example,
and
in
schoenbaum,
to
the
extent
it
has
recognized
the
effects
principles,
it
made
it
very
clear
that
those
are
very
narrow
exceptions,
the
lanham
act,
certain
of
the
securities
laws,
and
the
antitrust
laws.
they
are
a
reach
into
foreign
territories
which
have
never
been
applied
in
other
cases,
never
been
applied
in
employment
and
labor
law
statutes.
none
of
those
cases
is
cited
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
rather
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
are.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
when
one
really
examines
the
language
of
the
lanham
act,
the
securities
act
and
the
antitrust
act,
they
don't
just
use
the
foreign
commerce
or
foreign
nation
language
in
the
definition
of
commerce
itself,
which
would...
is
what
of
course
gives
jurisdiction
to
congress
to
legislate
nationally
rather
than
leaving
things
to
the
state,
but
rather
in
each
of
those
cases,
i
believe,
in
the
proscribed
conduct
provisions
of
the
statutes
they
talk
about
conduct
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
restraint
of
trade
and
commerce,
monopolization
of
trade
or
commerce
between
the
states
or
with
foreign
nations,
the
use
of
deceptive
or
misleading
trademarks
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
itself.
in
this
statute,
we
have
a
definition
of
commerce
and
of
interstate
commerce
which
is,
as
the
dissent
below
said,
nothing
more
than
a
jurisdictional
nexus.
the
predicate
for
congress
to
legislate
national...
nationally
in
an
area
that
might
otherwise
have
been
thought
to
be
left
to
the
states:
labor
and
employment,
and
discrimination
for
that
matter
in
the
early
years.
and...
but
in
the
section
that
proscribes
certain
unlawful
employment
practices,
there
is
no
reference
to
conduct
in
commerce,
employment
practices
in
commerce,
and
that
makes...
that's
a
distinction
between
all
of
those
cases.
another
distinction,
of
course,
is--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--in
this
statute?
in
title
vii?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
everyone
would
be
covered
by
the
act,
unless,
of
course,
one
assumes
and
presumes
that
congress
doesn't
legislate
beyond
its
borders
unless
it
says
it's
doing
so.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--i
think
you
did
understand
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
[laughter]
except
to
say
that...
except
to
say
that
if
the
commerce
language,
the
definition
of
commerce
in
any
statute
is
sufficient
to
conclude
that
that
statute
reaches
overseas,
then
we
have
an
awful
lot
of
statutes
on
the
books
that
reach
overseas
that
nobody
ever
thought
would.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--i'm
not
going
to
make
the
solicitor
general's
argument
for
him,
but
i
did
suggest,
and
i
think
i'm
right,
that
it
has
changed
and
shifted
from
time
to
time,
both
in
this
court
and
in
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
the
exemption
provides
coverage
by
a
negative
inference,
by
exempting
aliens
therefore
it
applies
to
u.s.
citizens,
or
whether
the
commerce
language
provides
coverage
and
then
the
exemption
withdraws
it.
either
of
them,
it
seems
to
us,
is
no
the
way
that
statutes
are
normally
construed.
just
to...
just
to--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
and
i
think
if
you,
if
you
read
the
entire
statute
and
try
to
figure
out
what
commerce
meant
here,
it's
a
difficult
task.
but
what
is...
what
is
clear
from
reading
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
is
that
this
was
an
unusual
statute
and
had
an
unusual
history
as
to
how
it
got
passed.
there
were
172
civil
rights
bills
considered
in
'63
and
'64.
there
were
441
witnesses,
that,
as
i
may
have
mentioned,
and
days
and
days
of
debates,
there
were
no
hearings
in
the
senate.
there
were
hearings
on
this
provision
in
the
labor
committee,
but
then
the
statute
went
over
to
the
judiciary
committee.
there
were
all
sorts
of
amendments,
there
were
substitute
bills
written
in
the
dead
of
night
and
delivered
to
congressmen's
doors
at
midnight.
there
was
the
dirksen-mansfield
amendment
which
is
what
really
was
finally
voted
on
in
the
senate,
which
nobody
had
a
chance
to
debate
really
at
great
length
in
that
form,
and
the
house
approved
the
same
thing
after
an
hour's
worth
of
debate.
so
when
you
look
at
all
of
that
and
you
see
this
one
provision
that
came
from
statutes
in
the
forties
and
fifties
as
to
which
i
think
we
have
offered
a
more
plausible
explanation,
historically,
as
to
how
it
got
there
and
what
it
means
than
has
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--it
is
an
explanation
which
really
turns
on
an
effort
by
congress
to
overrule
this
court's
decision
in
vermilya-brown.
and
both
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
in
the
fair
employment
bills
that
they
began
to
consider
immediately
after
the
vermilya-brown
decision,
they
began
for
the
first
time...
an
alien
exemption
provision
appeared
for
the
first
time,
and
a
redefinition
of
state,
territory,
and
possession
so
as
to
exclude
leased
bases
appeared
for
the
first
time.
by
the
time
we
got
to
'64
they
have
this
definition
of
"state"
which
clearly
goes
beyond
states
and
includes
territories
and
certain,
but
not
all,
possessions.
it
is...
it
is
set
forth
at...
briefly
in
our
brief
as
to
what
we
think
congress
was
trying
to
do--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--congress...
the
court
said
that
leased
bases
and
military
bases
are
possessions,
and
that
therefore--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--even
though
they
were
located
in
foreign
countries
they
were
possessions.
and
therefore
employees
employed
by
government
contractors,
most
of
whom
were
aliens,
were
entitled
to
the
same
benefits
i'd
say
most
of
them
were
not
u.s.
citizens...
were
entitled
to
the
same
benefits,
the
same
wages
and
hours
and
other
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
those,
quote,
"possessions"
that
everybody
else
was.
now,
what
justice
jackson
in
his
dissent
with
four
other
justices...
three
other
justices.
if
there
had
been
four
he
would
have
prevailed.
[laughter]
but
what
justice
jackson
said
in
his
dissent
is
that
that's
a
very
strained
reasoning...
reading
of
possessions,
and
that's
not
what
congress
meant
by
the
term
"possession",
and
it's
not
what
congress
meant
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
so
there
was
a
tremendous
effort
in...
immediately
after
vermilya-brown,
in
the
fair
employment
practices
act
and
ultimately
in
the
amendment
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
1957...
and
it
was
finally
amended
in
1957
because
some
people
brought
some
lawsuits
saying
they
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
that
vermilya-brown
seemed
to
suggest
they
had.
either
the
government
had
been
ignoring
vermilya-brown
for
6...
for
8
years,
or
no
one
thought
to
ask
for
those
same
benefits.
but
the
history
of
the
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
culminated
in
'57,
and
the
history
of
the
fair
employment
practices
statutes,
which
culminated
in
'64,
explain
how
the
alien
exemption
provision
got
into
the
statute
and
may
explain
how...
what
the
alien
exemption
provision
still
meant
when
the
'64
act
was
adopted.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
none.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
all
we
know
is
that
in
'49
congressman
powell
introduced
it
and
there
were
various
statutes.
when
it
got
to
'63,
'64,
congressman
roosevelt
in
the
labor
committee
took
language
that
had
come
up
through
the
years
from
the
fair
employment
practices
act
and
wrote
a
bill.
and
that
included
an
alien
exemption
and
included
that
one
sentence
in
the
legislative
history.
that...
that
bill
didn't
get
out
of
the
labor
committee.
congressman
roosevelt
came
over
to
the
judiciary
committee
one
day
and
said
this
is
much
stronger
than
what
president
kennedy
has
proposed.
put
it
in
the...
7152,
because
this
is
a
better
statute.
and
that's
how
it
got
there.
and
nobody,
in
debating
title
vii
or
any
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
civil...
became
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
ever
discussed
it
from
that
moment
forward.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that's
correct.
it
applied
equally
to
the
american
citizens
and
aliens,
and
the
correction,
we
say,
was...
attempted
to
be
accomplished
in
two
ways.
one
was
to
redefine
possessions
to
say
that
leased
bases
are
not
possessions.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
and
the
other
was
to
deal
expressly
with
the
problem
of
aliens
and
the
problem
of...
that
foreign
governments
suggested--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--i
think
it's...
i
think
it's
both.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
it's
both,
because,
again
if
you
look
at
the,
for
example,
the
dissenting
opinion
in...
i
forget,
the
concurring
opinion
in
foley
brothers
by
justice
frankfurter
and
justice
reed,
who
were
trying
to
relitigate
vermilya-brown,
if
i
might
say
so,
at
that
point,
they
were,
they
were
discussing
the
reactions
that
we
got
from
foreign
governments
and
from
the
defense
department
and
others
that--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--they
did.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
the
solicitor
general
is
here.
[laughter]
i
guess
that
the
next
thing
i...
i
don't
know
if
i
need
to
make
this
point
because
it
came
clear
from
the
discussion
between
justice
scalia
and
mr.
starr,
that
this
statute
would
apply
to
foreign
employers
as
well
as
to
u.s.
employers
if
it
were
extended
extraterritorially.
and
it's
just
a
host
of
problems
if
one
starts
down
that
road
because
there
is
really
no
principled
basis
on
which
to
make
those
distinctions.
and
one
wonders
why
the
solicitor
general
does
not
require
congress
or...
to
have
a
statutory
exemption
for
alien
or
foreign
employers,
and
asks
the
court
to
do
that
for
them,
when
it's
the
alien
exemption
for
foreign
employees
that
he
is
relying
on
here.
and
one
wonders
whether
he
would
also
limit
the
term
employer
to
u.s.
employers
in
this
country,
even
though
the
suggestion
of
sumitomo
and
the
suggestion
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
followed
sumitomo
is
that
when
in
the
united
states,
absent
a
treaty
to
the
contrary,
a
foreign
employer
is
bound
by
title
vii.
query:
shouldn't
we
be
bound
by
their
employment
laws
and
their
discrimination
laws
when
we
do
business
as
their
guests
in
their
country?
there
are
55
nations
at
least
that
have
adopted
employment
discrimination
laws
of
their
own,
and
most
of
them,
including
saudi
arabia's,
provide
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
say
expressly
that
they
regulate
all
employment
within
the
country's
borders,
including
those
involving
foreign
citizens.
we
don't
think
congress
could
have
intended...
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
congressional
intent...
to
impose
our
law
unilaterally
in
light
of
that.
we
don't
think
congress
could
have
done
that
in
light
of
ilo
convention
111
and
some
other
international
documents.
but
ilo
111
says
that,
that
every
country
should
act
nationally
within
its
own
sovereignty
to
deal
with
employment
discrimination.
we
also
think
that
to
apply
this
would
create
specific
conflicts,
not
just
conflicts
with
dual
sovereigns
trying
to
regulate
the
same
conduct,
but
specific,
specific
conflicts
that
are
suggested
in
the
brief
of
amicus
rule
of
law
committee.
the
laws
of
argentina,
saudi
arabia,
japan,
and
others,
have
different
rules,
with
respect
to
women
for
example.
more
protections
in
some
cases,
and
more
protectionism,
some
might
say,
in
other
cases.
but
they're
different.
there
are
other
kinds
of
conflicts,
obviously,
which
might
arise
as
well
between
the
law...
between
title
vii
and
the
laws
of
other
countries.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
their
call...
and
maybe
we
should
use
the
word
plural,
calls...
their
call
has
changed
dramatically
over
the
years.
one
can
look
at
their
early
guideline,
and
it
seems
clear
that
they're
saying
what
the
court
said
in
espinoza,
that
the
alien
exemption
provision
means
that
aliens
are
protected
in
this
country,
too,
and
nothing
more.
their
current
policy
guideline
really
suggests
exactly
what
the
problems
are.
they
don't
just
say
it
applies
to
u.s.
employers.
they
say
it
applies
to
some
foreign
employers.
and
then
they
have
a
whole
list
of
factors
that
they're
going
to
apply.
it
seems
to
us
that
you
don't
give
deference
to
an
agency
(1)
when
they're
wholly...
when
they're
completely
trying
to
rewrite
a
statute;
(2)
when
their
guidance...
guidelines...
1988
was
the
first
time
they
really
said
this...
was
not
contemporaneous;
(3)
when
it's
inconsistent
from
over
the
course
of
the
years;
(4)
when
it's
inconsistent
with
the
language,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
itself,
and
(5)
when
it's
only
a
guideline
and
not
a
regulation
because
they
don't
have
authorities
to...
authority
to
issue
regulations
in
this
area;
and
(6)
when
it
deals
with
their
own
jurisdiction.
they're
not
experts
either
on
their
own
jurisdiction
or
in
foreign
relations
law.
there
are
a
whole
host...
and
fundamentally
they're
wrong.
but
there
are
a
whole
host
of
reasons
why
the
court
ought
not
to
give
deference
to
the
eeoc
in
this
case.
it
didn't
give
deference
to
the
eeoc
in
espinoza,
for
example.
it
doesn't
always...
no,
it
doesn't
always
do
that,
obviously.
and
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
it
ought
not
to.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
actually
i
don't,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
exactly.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
in
the
end,
in
the
end
the
question
of
whether
this
was
good
policy...
what
what
the
solicitor
general
argues
was
good
policy
in
1964
was
a
question
for
congress,
and
we
say
they
didn't
do
it.
if
it's
good
policy
in
1991,
congress
can
do
it.
it
amended
the
age
discrimination
act;
it
passed
a
civil
rights
bill
this
year,
which
was
vetoed;
it
deals
with
discrimination
questions
time
and
again;
and
it
doesn't
hesitate
to
go
back
and
take
a
fresh
look
at
either
title
vii
or
some
of
the
other
titles
and
some
of
the
other
statutes.
and
it
is
free
to
do
that.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they're
very
time
consuming
over
there,
that's
true.
but
they
are
the...
they
are
the
branch
of
government
that
has
that
responsibility.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i...
whether...
there's
not
much
question
that
senator
grassley
thought
it
applied.
he
said
so
at
the
time
of
the
age
discrimination
hearings,
that
he
thought
it
applied
overseas.
he
also
said
that
he
thought
the
age
discrimination
statute
applied,
and
the
only
reason
to
amend
it
was
to
clarify
it.
the
chairman
of
the
eeoc
disagreed
with
him
on
that
point.
senator
grassley
was
referring
to
two
district
court
decisions
in
support
of
his
view,
and
one
of
them
was
dicta
and
one
of
them
was
overruled.
so
i
don't
think
it's
quite
fair
to
say
that
the
congress
agreed.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
one
senator
agreed.
and
i
think
there
have
been
some
statements
in
the
public
press
by
other
congressmen
that
they
would
seek
to
amend
the
statute
if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor.
unless
there
are
any
questions
about
justice
scalia's
testimony
in
1975--
[laughter]
--i
respectfully
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
thank
you.
