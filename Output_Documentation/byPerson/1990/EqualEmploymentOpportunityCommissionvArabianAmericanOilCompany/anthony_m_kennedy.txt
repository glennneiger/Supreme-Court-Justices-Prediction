justice
kennedy
well,
what
about,
say,
the
american
embassy
in
paris?
i
take
it
the
act,
even
if
you
look
at
the
exclusion
for
the
term
"state",
is
applicable
to
the
american
embassy
in
paris?
justice
kennedy
and
that
would...
that
would
make
the
exemption
have
some
sense,
because
it
would
mean
that,
i
take
it
an
american
citizen
would
be
protected
by
the
act
in
the
american
embassy,
but
that
an
alien
would
not
be?
justice
kennedy
but
incidentally,
mr.
starr,
my
example
of
the
coverage
of
the
american
embassy
would
pertain
under
both
your
and
the
respondents'
analysis
of
the
statute,
would
it
not?
in
other
words,
coverage
of
the
american
embassy
could--
justice
kennedy
--would
be
given
under
aramco's
interpretation
of
the
statute?
