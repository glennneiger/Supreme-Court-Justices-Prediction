justice
o'connor
but
of
course
that
sweeps
in
the
foreign
employer
as
well.
and
that's...
that's
where
it
gets
very
sticky,
i
think.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
in
our
minds
as
we
resolve
this
one.
justice
o'connor
that's
true,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
doesn't
produce
that
result,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
i...
you
argue
that
the...
there
has
to
be
a
congressional
intent
to
apply
it
extraterritorially
that
is
clear
and
affirmatively
expressed.
i'm
not
sure
that's
what
the
foley
case
stands
for.
in
fact
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
and
i
think
in
steele
against
bulova
watch
company,
where
the
lanham
act
was
held
applicable
extraterritorially,
there
wasn't
anything
clear
and
express.
so
i'm
wondering
whether
your
understanding
of
the
presumption
is
the
one
the
court
has
applied.
there
may
be
a
presumption
all
right,
but
i
would
think
it
would
just
go
to
congressional
intent,
express
or
otherwise.
justice
o'connor
i
guess
there
isn't
much
question
that
the
present
congress
has
been
under
the
impression
that
it
applies
to
u.s.
employers
of
u.s.
citizens
overseas.
