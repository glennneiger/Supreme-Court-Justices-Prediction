mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
a
single
question
of
statutory
interpretation:
whether
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
applies
to
acts
of
discrimination
by
u.s.
employers
with
respect
to
u.s.
citizens
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
in
this
case
the
fifth
circuit,
sitting
en
banc,
held
that
title
vii
does
not
apply
abroad,
relying
on
the
well-established
presumption
that
acts
of
congress
ordinarily
do
not
apply
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states,
absent
an
expression
of
intent
to
the
contrary.
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
inadequate
evidence
of
congress'
intent
so
as
to
overcome
the
presumption.
as
a
result
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
lawsuit
filed
in
this
case
by
the
private
petitioner,
ali
boureslan.
mr.
boureslan
is
a
naturalized
u.s.
citizen
who
alleges
in
his
complaint
that
during
the
course
of
his
employment
in
saudi
arabia
by
aramco,
a
u.s.
corporation,
that
he
was
the
victim
of
discrimination
based
on
race,
religion,
and
national
origin.
in
our
view,
title
vii's
protections
do
not
stop
at
the
border.
to
the
contrary,
congress
intended
for
title
vii's
protections
to
run
to
the
benefit
of
u.s.
citizens
wherever
they
may
be
when
they
are
in
the
employ
of
u.s.
employers.
its
intent,
we
believe,
is
reflected
in
both
the
text
and
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself.
in
light
of
its
broad
grant
of
coverage
set
forth
in
the
opening
section
of
title
vii,
2000e,
congress
then
in
the
next
provision,
section
702.2000e-1
carved
out
two
exceptions
to
title
vii's
sweep,
specifically,
an
addition
to
the
exception
with
respect
to
religious
institutions.
congress
created
the
alien
exemption
which
expressly
exempts
from
title
vii
the
employment
of,
the
words
of
the
statute,
aliens
outside
any
state.
the
most
natural
reading
of
this
provision,
we
believe,
is
that
the
statutory
protections
of
title
vii
do
apply
outside
the
united
states,
but
that
the
statute's
coverage
is
limited
by
category.
that
is,
by
excluding
one
category,
aliens,
from
coverage,
the
most
natural
and
reasonable
inference
to
draw
is
that
u.s.
citizens
are
protected.
and
that
reading
is
fully
supported--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
is
an
exceptionally
strained
reading
of
it.
there
is
no
basis
whatever
in
the
text
of
this
statute
to
believe
that
that
is
what
congress
was
getting
at,
and
indeed,
the
legislative
history...
and
the
only
legislative
history
with
respect
to
this
specific
exemption
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
in
1963
and
1964...
is
in
support
of
our
reading
of
it.
the
house
committee
report
says
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
not
with
respect
to
territories
to
solve
the
vermilya-brown
problem
that
the
respondents
have
suggested,
but
rather
it
was...
the
purpose
was
to
remove,
these
are
the
words
of
the
report,
conflicts
of
law,
conflicts
of
law
which
might
otherwise
exist
between
the
united
states
and
a
foreign
nation
in
the
employment
of
aliens
outside
the
united
states
by
an
american
enterprise.
and
the
senate
reports
contains
a
very
similar
explanation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
it's
strained
at
all,
because
for
one
thing,
we
have
guidance
from
what
congress
was
getting
at,
especially
in
the
history
of
this
provision,
that
it
was
getting
at
discrimination
by
u.s.
employers.
that
has
been
the
interpretation
of
the
eeoc--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think,
in
response
to
your
question,
that
the
court
should
engage
in
a
clear
statement
form
of
analysis
that
it
has
done
in
the
eleventh
amendment
setting,
in
tribal
sovereign
immunity
settings,
in...
in
the
law
of
preemption
to
require
a
clear
and
unambiguous
statement.
and
that
is
this.
in
this
context
we're
talking
about
congress
applying
this
statute
to...
and
intending
to
cover...
american
enterprises.
the
court
frequently
reads
broadly
drafted
laws
against
the
backdrop
of
the
law
of
conflicts
of
law.
and
it
is
clear
that
its
application
to
foreign
nationals,
foreign
entities,
would
raise
very
serious
questions.
that's
what
this
court
had
before
it
in
cases
such
as
benz
and
mcculloch.
that's
what
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
critical
case,
the
pivotal
case
in
terms
of
the
presumption
of
foley
brothers.
so
when
we
look
at
the
court's
analysis
there,
what
did
it
find?
it
found
that
there
was
absolute
silence.
we
don't
think
there
is
silence
here.
we
think
the
alien
exemption
provision
is
a
powerful
provision.
it
is
a
powerful
message
in
terms
of
congress'
intent.
what
the
court
said
in
foley
brothers
is
here's
a
statute
that
is
very
broadly
worded,
the
eight
hour
law.
there
is
no
geographic
limitation
at
all,
and
we
have
found
no
indication
whatsoever
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
terms
of
its
applicability
extraterritorially.
for
us
to
apply
it
extraterritorially
would
require
us
to
require
it,
by
its
language,
to
foreign
nationals.
and
that,
we
think
congress
would
have
been
clear
if
it
had
intended
it
not
to
apply
extraterritorially
but
to
foreign
nationals.
the
oddity
of
applying
a
u.s.
fair
labor
standards
act
to
foreign
work
places
and
to
foreign
nationals
in
those
foreign
work
places
has
been
evident.
congress
has
been...
i
think
this
is
one
thing
about
the
drafting
of
the
1964
statute
that
is
important.
congress,
in
drafting
the
statute,
had
before
it
a
different
model.
it
had
the
fair
labor
standards
act
model.
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
by
its
terms,
213(f),
does
not
apply
to
foreign
work
places.
congress
has
used
that
model
in
other
statutes,
including
in
the
original
version
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
it
has
also
limited
expressly...
expressly...
the
applicability
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
domestic
work
places.
it
did
not
do
so--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
when
we
look--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
exception,
however,
is
one
with
respect
to
foreign
employers
that
is
powerfully
suggested
by
the
history
of
this
provision
and
the
way
this
court
has
historically
gone
about
the
analysis
of
broadly
worded
statutes
against
the
backdrop
of
conflicts
of
law.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
lauritzen
against
larsen.
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
that
court...
in
that
case
was
dealing
with
a
jones
act
action.
the
jones
act
was
very
broadly
interpreted.
any
seaman.
but
the
court,
in
going
through
a
careful
conflict
of
laws
analysis,
concluded
that
it
did...
would
not
apply
in
the
setting
of
a
foreign
national.
that's
what
the
eeoc,
the
agency
that
is...
of
course
is
charged
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
has
concluded
that
congress
had
in
mind,
to
cover
u.s.
employers
and
not
foreign
corporations,
and
indeed
that
is
the
only
authority
of
which
we
are
aware,
judicially,
in
the
lavrov
case,
where
the
district
court
said
this
does
not
apply
to
a
foreign
corporation
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
that
is
a
very
understandable,
natural
reading
of
the
statute
against
the
backdrop
of
conflict
of
laws,
as
well
as
congress'
specific
intent
to
get
at
what
the
reports
called
american
enterprises.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
because
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
standard
for
liability
has
been
established
by
title
vii,
and
that's...
the
bfoq
exception
is
obviously
available
to
the
state,
but
not
based
upon
stereotypes
and
the
like.
it
would
have
to
satisfy
the
stringent
provisions
of
bfoq.
but
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
law
of
a
foreign
nation,
we're
then
in
an
area
where
there
are
these
understandable
areas
of
concern
and
sensitivity,
and
that's
why
the
question
that
has
been
presented
to
this
court
is
very
narrow
and
very
specific.
and
aramco
doesn't
contest
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
the
applicability
of
title
vii
to
u.s.
employers.
my
ultimate
response,
justice
scalia,
to
this
line
of
questioning
is
let
that
wait
for
another
day.
but
in
discussing
that,
in
looking
to
that
other
day
and
being
mindful
that
that
case
will
eventually
arise,
the
confort
that
i
want
to
give
you
is
that
the
eeoc,
the
agency
charged
with
interpreting
this
statute,
has
very
reasonably
interpreted
it
as
not
applying
to
foreign
corporations.
and
this
court
has
done
precisely
the
same
kind
of
conflict
of
laws
analysis
time
and
time
again.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
did.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
different
because
when
we
look
at
what
foley
brothers...
the
analysis
of
the
court
in
foley
brothers,
the
statement
of
the
canon
of
construction
is
is
there...
the
presumption
is
it
applies
only
domestically
unless
a
contrary
intent
appears.
when
the
court
then
engages
in
the
analysis
of
the
statute,
it
notes
one
very
pivotal
thing
in
addition
to
congress'
silence,
that
congress...
at
page
286
of
the
opinion...
that
congress
in
the
act
drew
no
distinction
between
alien
labor
and
citizen
labor.
and
that
fact,
that
congress
failed
to
draw
that
distinction,
resonated
powerfully
with
the
court
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
therefore
for
the
law
to
have
applied
overseas
by
virtue
of
the
oddity,
as
the
court
saw
it,
of
it
applying,
it
being
the
eight-hour
statute,
to
iranian
nationals
working
in
iran
on
a
u.s.
project.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
found
in
the
definitional
provisions
in
2000e(i).
the
term
"state"
is
defined
to
include
the
states
of
the
united
states,
the
district
of
columbia,
puerto
rico,
the
virgin
islands,
and
a
number
of
other
territories
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that's
right.
that
does
not
fall
within
the
definition--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
an
alien
would
not
be
able
to
avail
himself
or
herself
of
the
protections
of
title
vii.
it
is
not
at
all
odd
or
anomalous
that
congress
would
have
drafted
the
statute
and
created
this
sort
of
scheme
of
coverage.
and
i
think
that
the
adea
experience
is
instructive,
because
when
congress
learned
that
the
obvious
result
of
its
incorporating
the
fair
labor
standards
act
geographic
limitation
in
the
adea,
when
it
learned
the
consequences
of
that,
that
americans
abroad
were
not
protected,
congress
moved
with
alacrity
to
say
we
have
an
anomaly
in
the
coverage
of
the
anti-discrimination
laws
of
the
united
states.
we
want
to
move
to
end
that
anomaly.
and
it
was
in
that
connection
that
congress
was
reminded
of
what
it
was
already
charged
with
knowledge
of,
namely--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--because
of
the
united
states
being--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
may,
except
aramco's
reading,
and
it
will
speak
for
itself,
as
i
understand
it,
is
no
extraterritorial
reach.
so
even
though
the
foreign
government...
excuse
me,
the
united
states
government
is
now,
as
it
was
not
in
1964,
covered
by
the
act,
i
think
that
aramco's
position
would
be
that
unless
there
are
other
coverages,
executive
orders,
other
bodies
of
law
to
which
a
person
would
look
who
is
employed
by
an
embassy,
then,
indeed,
title
vii
does
not
apply
overseas.
i
think
they
have
acknowledged
a
base
of
work
place
exception.
if
someone
leaves
on
a
trip,
is
away
for
a
short
period
of
time,
i
think
they
do
contemplate
a
sensible
reading
of
the
statute
to
that
limited
extent.
but
if
someone
is
actually
employed
in
paris
or
in
tokyo
by
a
u.s.
employer,
and
that
person
is
there
for
part
of
his
or
her
career,
their
vision
of
title
vii
is
not
applicable
to
a
u.s.
employer.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
have
to,
with
all
respect,
quarrel
with
your
reading
out
of
the
commerce
definition,
foreign
commerce,
by
virtue
of
the
magic
words
not
being
there.
the
words...
the
definition
of
commerce
includes
commerce
outside
any
state.
there
are
several
definitions
of
commerce
which
make
it
very,
very
global
in
its
reach.
and
i
don't
think
there
should
be
a
serious
question.
i
realize
the
other
side
is
going
to
suggest
to
you
that
there
is,
but
there
should
not
be
a
serious
question
that
the
natural
reading
of
the
commerce
provision
covers
foreign
commerce,
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states
with
respect--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--exactly.
anyplace
outside
there,
justice
white,
is
exactly
that.
it
is
quite
broad.
anyplace
means,
to
me,
especially
given
the
other
definitions...
the
opening
definition
is
the
constitution,
the
commerce
clause
definition
of
interstate
commerce,
commerce
affecting
among
the
several
states.
but
it
goes
on,
it
does
not
stop,
and
defines
commerce
very
broadly,
very
globally.
the
point
i
want
to
make
about
benz
is
this,
justice
scalia.
benz
involved
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
applying
u.s.
law
aboard
a
foreign
vessel.
note
that
that
foreign
vessel
was
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
but
the
difficulty
in
terms
of
considerations
of
international
law
and
comity
was
that
it
was
a
foreign
flag
vessel
with
a
foreign
crew.
the
court
declined
to
grant
territorial
application
of
united
states
law,
even
though
that
was
in
a
harbor
of
the
united
states
and
clearly
engaged
in
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states.
and
why
did
it
do
it?
it
said
because
what
would
be
the
result
would
be
extraordinary
in
terms
of
maritime
law
and
the
law
of
international
relations.
what
we're
again
dealing
with
here
is
a
u.s.
corporation
and
a
u.s.
national,
and
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
no
considerations
of
great
concern
in
international
law
are
raised
by
the
application
of
u.s.
law
to
a
u.s.
citizen,
even
though
that
citizen
may
be
abroad
at
the
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
employer
may
well...
wickard
v.
filburn,
broad
definitions
of
commerce,
but
i
think
that
would
raise
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
that
entity
is
involved
in
u.s.
commerce,
including
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
certainly
would
be
an
argument.
it
may
very
well
be
that
our
position
would
be,
under
wickard
v.
filburn
and
the
kind
of
components
and
so
forth
that
the
entity
is
using,
that
there
would
be
coverage.
as
long
as...
that's
the
point
that
i
have
inadequately
made.
this
is
law
applicable
to
united
states
citizens.
this
court
in
unanimous
opinions
authored
by
chief
justices
taft,
hughes,
in
numerous
cases
has
said
the
application
of
u.s.
law
to
u.s.
citizens
on
the
high
seas
and
even
in
foreign
lands
is
all
right
as
long
as
you're
not,
quote,
"interfering
with
the
rights
of
foreign
nationals.
"
there's
no--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--let
me
not
beg
the
question
by
saying
this
law
applies
abroad
in
our
reading
of
the
statute
for
these
reasons.
the
alien
exemption
points
powerfully
in
that
direction.
that's
what
the
exemption
is
all
about.
it
contemplates
foreign
application.
that
is
what,
in
our
judgment,
a
broad
and
sweeping
definition
of
commerce
powerfully
suggests.
if
there
is
any
doubt,
all,
all
of
it,
the
legislative
history
directly
in
point
supports
our
interpretation
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--my
basic
message
is
leave
that
sticky
question
to
another
day.
that's
not
the
question
presented.
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
should
not
be
in
the
court's
mind.
and
our
response
to
the
court
is
this.
in
our
reading
of
this
voluminous
legislative
history,
our
study
of
the
text,
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself,
there
is
not
a
single
indication
that
congress
was
seeking
to
get
at
non-american
enterprises.
that
is
what
the
senate
report
says,
that's
what
the
house
report
says,
that's
what
an
interpretive
memorandum,
the
case...
the
clark
case
interpretive
memorandum
says.
what--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
does
not,
and
when
this
court
has
historically
faced
that
question
it
has
looked
to
the
backdrop
of
conflicts
of
law.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
foley
brothers.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
foley
brothers
is
here
there
is
that
contraindication
of
congress'
intent
that
the...
that
the
foley
court
found
completely
silent.
in
terms
of
the
clarity
of
the
intent,
we
would
urge
that
the
court
very
carefully
consider
the
use
of
terms
such
as
"clear
and
unambiguous"
and
the
like
for
this
reason.
that
is
not
the
formulation
of
foley
brothers.
it's
not
the
formulation
that
this
court
used
in
quoting
from
foley
brothers
in
the
argentine
republic
case
two
terms
ago.
what
foley
brothers
speaks
to
is
is
there
a
contrary
intent.
it
is
not
an
eleventh
amendment
federalism
kind
of
value
that
is
at
stake
when
we
are
talking
about
the
application
of
u.s.
law
to
u.s.
citizens.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
we
should
understand
what
is
at
stake
and
what
aramco
is
saying,
that
aramco
and
other
u.s.
employers
are
free
to
discriminate
overseas
on
grounds
of
race,
religion,
national
origin,
and
gender,
and
the
like.
very
briefly,
mr.
friedman
has
quite
properly
used
the
term
"canon
of
construction".
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
terms
of
the
judicial
tools
to
employ
in
getting
at
the
ultimate
question
of
what
congress
intended.
the
presumption
is,
as
this
court
said
in
foley
brothers,
a
canon
of
construction.
it
is
an
axiom
of
experience,
it
is
to
assist
the
court.
it
should
not
be
employed
to
require
of
congress
a
particular
form
to
express
itself.
and
when
we
look
at
what
congress
did,
i
think
the
fair
inference
to
be
drawn
from
a
reading
of
the
entire
text
of
this
statute
is
that,
and
i
will
state
clearly,
that
it
is
in
fact
the
combination
of
the
broad
jurisdictional
reach
within
the
structural
creation
of
an
exemption
from
that
broad
reach
which
gives
us
comfort
that
congress
intended
for
there
to
be
extraterritorial
applicability.
with
respect
to
the
specifics
and
the
legislative
history
on
vermilya-brown,
one
critical
point
is
vermilya-brown
was
effectively
revisited
legislatively
in
1957.
the
problem
that
congress
had
with
vermilya-brown
was
therefore
taken
care
of
several
years
before
the
focus
on
the
172
bills
that
mr.
friedman
suggests
so
dominated
the
legislative
history
of
the
'64
statute,
which
is
what
we're
about
here.
that
congress
was
nonetheless
trying
to
fix
up
a
problem
that
had
been
fixed
in
1957.
what
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
is...
that
there
may
have
been
some
lingering
problem,
but
to
the
extent
there
was
a
congressional
problem,
vermilya-brown
handled
it.
and
here
is
the
key
point
which
they
don't
dispute.
all,
all
of
it,
the
legislative
history...
it
is
not
extensive...
but
all
of
it
is
in
our
favor
with
respect
to
what
this
alien
exemption
meant
in
this
statute.
and
the
authoritative
memorandum,
this
court
in
stotts
and
other
cases--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--our
reading
of
the
statute
with
respect--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
at
page...
it
is.
at
page
16
of
our
opening
brief,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
two
reports
from
which
we
draw.
and
then
in
the
authoritative
memorandum
of
senators
clark
and
case,
the
bipartisan
memorandum,
that
memorandum
states
that
the
meaning
of
this
exemption
is
that
it
provides
an
exemption
with
respect
to
what
the
employment
of
aliens
abroad--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--this
court
in
stotts
said
specifically
that
this
court
has
on
two
prior
occasions
recognized
the
authoritative
nature
of
this
memorandum
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
title
vii.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
on
three
occasions.
i
thank
the
court.
