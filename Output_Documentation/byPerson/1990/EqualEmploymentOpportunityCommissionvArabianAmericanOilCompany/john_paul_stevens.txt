justice
stevens
general
starr,
can
i
just
ask
this
question
on
the
definition
with
respect
to
justice
white's
question,
commerce
between
a
foreign
nation
and
any
state.
what
about
an
american
employer
running
a
business
in
saudi
arabia
that
just
does
business
in
the
near
east
and
has
no
transactions
with
the
united
states?
is
that
covered?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
because
the
statute
is
not
narrowly
limited
to
engaged
in
commerce.
they
have...
it's
the
broadest
possible
language
in
the
prohibition--
justice
stevens
--yes.
it's
just
every
person,
and
basically
everyone
is
covered
by
the
act,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
no,
but
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
the
reference
to
commerce
in
statutes
like
the
sherman
act
and
all,
limits...
is
a
limiting
provision
if
the...
if
you
added
words
here
it
shall
be
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
when
in
commerce,
or
something,
that
would
tend
to
limit
the
scope
of
it
rather
than
broaden
it.
and
as
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
commerce,
i
don't
think
adds
any
force
to
your
argument.
justice
stevens
i
may
not
have
quite
understood
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
their
response
is
you
really
have
to
read
that
definitional
provision
together
with
the
exemption,
the
alien
exemption.
justice
stevens
and
i'm
not
sure
they're
entirely
independent
of
one
another,
which
is
sort
of
what
you're
arguing.
justice
stevens
no,
normally
we
read
the
entire
statute
and
try
and
figure
out
what
congress
meant.
justice
stevens
we
read
it
all
together.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
friedman?
the
vermilya-brown
problem,
as
i
recall,
it
was
a
question
of
defining
the
territory
or
the
geographic
area
covered,
and
the
decision
applied
equally
to
american
citizens
and
aliens,
and
the
correction
applied
equally
to
american
citizens
and
aliens.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
that's
dealing
with
the
problem
of
aliens
in
territories
or
geographic
locations
where
there
was
unquestioned
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
and
they
also
relied
heavily
on
letters
from
different
parts
of
the
executive
branch
of
our
government,
too.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
have
any
such
support
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
no,
you
say
we
give
them
the
same
deference
we
gave
them
in
the
general
electric
case?
justice
stevens
yeah.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
of
course
fresh
looks
at
this
statute
are
very
time
consuming
over
there.
justice
stevens
but
general
starr,
i'm
not
sure
i
have
the
various
language
in
mind,
but
i
think
the
argument
ran
that
during
that
fixing
up
of
vermilya-brown
they
adopted
language
which
was
much
like
this,
and
the
pattern,
you
just
assume
that
when
they
copied
language
which
was
used
previously
it
may
have
had
the
same
purpose.
isn't
that
what
their
argument
is?
