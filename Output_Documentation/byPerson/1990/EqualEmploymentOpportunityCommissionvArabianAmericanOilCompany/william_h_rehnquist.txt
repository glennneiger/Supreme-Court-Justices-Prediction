chief
justice
rehnquist
general
starr,
foley
brothers
involved
an
american
employer
and
an
american
citizen,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
that's
different
because
the
statute
was
written
differently?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
statutory
definition
of
the
word
"state"
in
the
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
they...
the
way
they
define
"state",
the
alien
exemption,
saying
employment
of
aliens
outside
any
"state",
would
mean
outside
of
any
state
or
territory,
basically.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
mr.
friedman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
friedman,
that
there
is
some
reason
why
securities
acts
as
a
class,
or
the
lanham
act
should
apply,
and
the
statute
like
title
vii
shouldn't?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
that
explanation,
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
problem
of
vermilya-brown
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
with
this
exception?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
they
were
located
in
foreign
countries.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
legislative
history
in
connection
with
the
'64
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
shows.
so
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
connection
with
that
act
that
would
show
how
the
alien
exemption
came
to
be
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
starr,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
89-1838
eeoc
versus
arabian
american
oil
company.
in
this
case,
petitioner,
alley
buraslon,
a
naturalized
us
citizen
born
in
lebanon
and
working
in
saudi
arabia,
was
discharged
by
his
employer,
aram
co.,
a
delaware
corporation.
after
filing
a
charge
with
the
eeoc,
he
filed
suit
with
the
federal
district
court
seeking
relief
under
tittle
seven
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
discriminated
against
because
of
his
race,
religion,
and
national
origin.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
claim
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirm
saying
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
tittle
sevens
protection
did
not
extend
to
united
states
citizens
employed
abroad
by
american
employers.
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
agree
that
tittle
seven
does
not
apply
extraterritorially
to
regulate
the
employment
practices
of
the
united
states
firms
that
employ
american
citizens
abroad.
the
evidence
offered
by
petitioners
to
demonstrate
a
congressional
intent
that
tittle
seven
apply
extraterritorially
while
not
totally
lacking
in
probative
value,
simply
false
short
of
demonstrating
the
clearly
expressed
affirmative
congressional
intent
that
is
required
to
overcome
the
well-established
presumption
against
extraterritorially.
that
is,
the
presumption
says
that
ordinarily,
laws
passed
by
congress
are
presumed
to
apply
only
within
the
united
states.
we
find
unpersuasive
petitioner's
argument
that
tittle
sevens
alien
exemption
provision
which
renders
the
statute
inapplicable
to
an
employer
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
aliens
outside
any
state
clearly
manifests
the
necessary
intent.
an
absent
that
clearly
is
showing
that
we
have
here,
we
will
not
ascribe
to
congress
a
policy
which
would
raise
difficult
international
law
issues
by
imposing
this
country's
employment
discrimination
regime
upon
foreign
corporations
operating
in
foreign
commerce.
justice
scalia
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part

filed
a
dissenting
opinion
