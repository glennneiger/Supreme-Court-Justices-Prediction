justice
scalia
general
starr,
that's
the
most...
you
assert
that's
the
most
reasonable
reading.
do
you
think
it's
the
only
reading?
is
it
textually
not
possible
to
understand
it
to
apply
just
in
the
situation
of
united
states
territories,
so
you'd
be
outside
the
states,
but
still
not
in
a
foreign
country?
justice
scalia
general
starr,
let's
grant
that
that
is
a
strained
reading.
i
suppose
it's
also
a
strained
reading
of
a
statute
that
confers
jurisdiction
over
all
companies
involved
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states.
it
is
probably
a
strained
reading
to
read
that
as
applying
only
to
united
states
companies
or
companies
involved
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
on
the
shores
of
this
country,
as
opposed
to
in
france
or
germany.
that's
a
strained
reading,
too,
but
we
do
it
all
the
time,
don't
we?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
saying
this
provision
is
strained.
you're
mistaking
my
question.
i'm
granting
it's
strained.
but
i'm
saying,
does
not
our
doctrine
that
when
congress...
when
congress
means
to
apply
the
laws
of
the
united
states
abroad,
it
must
be
clear
about
it,
does
not
that
doctrine
mean
that
we
will
accept
strained
readings
and
will
indeed
impose
strained
readings
in
order
to
defeat
extraterritorial
jurisdiction,
unless
congress
has
been
clear
about
it?
because
when
we
say
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
or
when
congress
says
that,
we
do
not
interpret
that
to
mean
anybody
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
abroad.
and
i
think
that's
a
pretty
strained
reading,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
general
starr,
we,
we
could
have
held
in
that
case
simply
it
doesn't
apply
to
foreign
nationals.
we
could
have
simply
said
it
doesn't
apply.
which
is
what
you're
saying
in
this
case.
on
its
face
you
acknowledge
this
does
not
apply
to
employees
who
are
foreign
nationals,
but
on
its
face
it
would
apply
to
companies
abroad
who
are
not
united
states
companies,
just
as
it
applies
domestically
to
companies
that
are
not
united
states
companies.
justice
scalia
you
want
us
to
read
it
not
that
way.
you
want
us
to
create
an
exception
that
is
not
in
the
text.
justice
scalia
general
starr,
the
more
of
these
unexpressed
exceptions
you
have
to
read
into
the
statute
to
make
it
work,
the
less
it
strikes
me
as
clear,
which
our
opinions
say
it
has
to
be,
that
the
statute
is
meant
to
have
extraterritorial
application.
you
read
in
another
exception,
too.
you
say
that,
for
example,
if
saudi
law
requires
the
segregation
of
men
and
women
in
the
work
place,
that
that
would
be
covered
by
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
exception.
would
we
allow
a
state
law
of
one
of
the
united...
one
of
the
sovereign
states
to
qualify
as
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
exception
if
a
state
required
some
provision
that
is
contrary
to
title
vii?
justice
scalia
general
starr,
we
said
in
benz
that
for
us,
that
is
this
court,
to
run
interference
in
such
a
delicate
field
of
international
relations,
that
is
to
interpret
the
statute
to
apply
abroad,
there
must
be
present
the
affirmative
intention
of
the
congress
clearly
expressed.
now,
what
clear
expression
do
you
find
in
this
statute,
other
than
the
negative
implication
from
this
exception?
the
definition
of
commerce
does
not
even
mention
foreign
commerce,
as
some
statutes
do.
what
is
there
beyond
the
negative
implication
of
this
exclusion
of
foreign
workers,
that
constitutes
a
clear
expression
of
congress?
justice
scalia
general
starr,
this
is
a
law
applicable
only
to
united
states
citizens
only
because
you
say
it
is
a
law
applicable
only
to
united
states
citizens.
if
you
read
the
statute
on
its
face,
it's
applicable
to
everybody,
every
employer.
and
certainly
within
the
united
states
you
interpret
it
that
way,
as
being
applicable
to
every
employer.
it
seems
to
me
to
justify
the
expansion
of
the
statute
by
saying
it's
only
applicable
to
united
states
citizens
is
to
beg
the
question.
only
after
you
decide
that
it
applies
abroad
do
you
invent
the
limitation
that
it
applies
only
to
the
united
states
citizen,
because
to
apply
it
to
other
people
abroad
would
be
unthinkable.
justice
scalia
mr.
friedman,
what
about
the
deference
we
normally
accord
to
the
agency
that
is
charged
with
implementing
the
act?
here
it's
the
eeoc.
there
is
no
doubt
that
that's
the
agency
committed
with
the
responsibility
for
this
act,
and
they
simply
cisagree
with
you
on
a
matter
that
is
arguably
ambiguous.
why,
why
isn't
their
call
what
governs?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
we
should
give
them
deference
here?
justice
scalia
what
is
an
authoritative
memorandum?
i
mean,
what
made
it
authoritative?
was
it...
was
it
adopted
in
the
statute
or
something?
justice
scalia
oh.
it's
authoritative
because
we
said
so,
then?
[laughter]
