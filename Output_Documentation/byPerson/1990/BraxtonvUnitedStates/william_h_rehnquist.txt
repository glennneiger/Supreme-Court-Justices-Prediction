chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
in
argument
no.
90-5358,
thomas
braxton
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
cribari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
is
the
government...
how
does
the
government's
factual
proffer
come
up
in
this
case?
was
it
to
show
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
really
get
exactly...
perhaps
you
should
be
more
explicit
about
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
the
door
open
when
he
fired
the
shots?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
what
it
is
considering
but
has
not
acted
upon?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
that
a
stipulation
is
a
word
of
art
meaning
an
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
defendant,
do
you
mean
that
it
can't
be
entered
into
by
attorneys?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what...
what
then
is
your
point
when
you
say
that
it's
an
agreement
between
the
defendant
and
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
what
happened
here
with
the
government
making
a
proffer
for
the
voluntariness
purposes,
the
judge
asking
the
defendant
if
he
agreed,
he
says
that
is
not
an
agreement
between
the
parties.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how--
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
your
time,
mr.
cribari?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
marzen,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when...
when
you
say
to
respond
to
the
government's
factual
proffer,
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
are
you
talking
about?
the...
the
rule
11?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
the
guidelines
have
anything
to
do
with
a
proffer
for
a
rule
11
purpose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
don't...
i
didn't
see
anything
in
the
guidelines
about
what
a
defendant
did
at
a
rule
11
hearing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it
says...
it
says
a
plea
containing
a
stipulation
that's
specifically
established.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
i...
i
think
you're
assuming
something
when
you
bring
rule
11
in
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean...
well,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
a
finding
is
really
quite
different
than
an
agreement
or
stipulation,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
the
district
court
has
to
make
a
finding,
doesn't
that
perhaps
negate
the
existence
of
a
stipulation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
does
specifically
establish
a
more
serious
offense
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
stipulate
to
the
elements
of
the
offense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
those
are...
those
are...
are
they
the
same
thing...
the
facts
or
the
elements?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
government's
factual
proffer
leaves
you
short
on
the
element
of...
on
the
issue
of
intent.
the...
the...
you
say
the
judge
had
to
do
deduce
that,
and
it
was
a
permissible
reduction
from
the
stipulation.
but
i...
is
that
enough
under
this
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
rule
35
one
year?
chief
justice
rehnquist
contendere.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
petitioner
[inaudible]
argue
that
that
the
phrase
containing
a
stipulation
is
a
clause
modifying
the
earlier
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
plea
of
guilty
itself
doesn't
have
to
contain
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
stipulation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
stipulation
between
the
government
and
the
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
seems
like
a
unilateral
act
in
many
ways.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
if
it's
a
unilateral
act,
how
can
it
be
an
agreement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marzen.
mr.
cribari,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
don't
waste
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
understand.
thank
you,
mr.
cribari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-5358,
braxton
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia
