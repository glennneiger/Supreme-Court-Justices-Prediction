justice
stevens
but
your
theory
is
he...
he
did
aim
at
him
and
failed
to
hit
him?
justice
stevens
and
that's
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
or
what
is
the
standard
for
establishing?
is
it
something
that
the
judge
might
find
or
must
find?
justice
stevens
and
he
must
find
that
he
was
a
poor
marksman
rather
than
he
did
not
intend
to
hit
him?
justice
stevens
--after
the
colloquy.
and
i
notice
the
presentence
report,
the
author
of
that
recommended
that
he
be
sentenced
on
the
basis
of
the
attempted
murder.
had
that
recommendation
been
made
by
the
prosecutor
or
anyone
else
before
the...
before
it
was
filed
in
the
pre-sentence
report?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
this
i.e.
is
what
he
said
or
what
you're
saying?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
it's
rather
an
important
i.e.--
[laughter]
justice
stevens
and
then
what's
the
next
sentence?
that
you
could
depart
upward
if
you
think
he
tried
to
murder
the
marshals?
justice
stevens
which
hardly
suggests
that
he
thought
you
didn't
have
to
depart
upward
if
you
thought
he
tried
to
murder
the
marshals.
justice
stevens
i
see.
