justice
marshall
is
there
any
difference
between
stipulation
and
admission?
justice
marshall
well,
wasn't
there
an
admission
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
well,
why
do
you
need
a
stipulation?
justice
marshall
so,
in
that
point
you
agree
with
the
petitioner?
justice
marshall
how
is
an
agreement
to
be
guilty
a
stipulation?
it's
only
one
party
involved.
justice
marshall
can
one
party
stipulate?
justice
marshall
but
in
this
case,
yes.
well--
[laughter]
justice
marshall
for
purposes
of
conviction,
it's
okay.
justice
marshall
i
can't
help
it.
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
trap.
justice
marshall
well,
why
didn't
he
stipulate
if
he
knew
all
of
this?
justice
marshall
but
this
didn't
come
up
then.
it
came
up
way
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
justice
marshall
it
didn't
come
up
when
he,
quote,
"stipulated",
end
quote.
justice
marshall
it
came
up
later
on.
justice
marshall
and
i'd
be
awful
wary
about
this
now.
mr.
marzen,
can
i
ask
you--
--the
defense
counsel
has
to
really
be
wary.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts.
did...
i
take
it
the
presentence
report
was
prepared
after
the
plea
was
entered--
