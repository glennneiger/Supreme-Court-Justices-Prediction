justice
kennedy
so
he
intended
to
assault
the
door?
justice
kennedy
is
this
a
formal
plea
agreement?
justice
kennedy
does
formal
plea
agreement
mean
written,
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
have
to
concede
that
what
they
are
doing
is
a
clarification?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
why
can't
you
argue
it
to
this...
to
us,
well,
this
would
be
a
new
guideline?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
there's
a
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
the
elements
of
the
offense
were
established
by
the
facts
that
were
conceded.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
had
this...
the
concession...
we
won't
call
it
a
stipulation...
the
concession
that
you
had
here
with
one
added
element.
the
defendant
said,
and
i
do
not
stipulate
or
concede
that
i
had
an
intent
to
murder.
what
result
in
that
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
a
rather
odd...
odd
reading
of
specifically
establish
a
defense.
if
you
say
i
want
to
make
very
clear
i
do
not
stipulate
of
had
the
intent
to
commit
this
crime.
justice
kennedy
and
you
say,
well,
what
you've
said
specifically
establishes
this.
justice
kennedy
did
the
district
court
advise
this
defendant
of
the
elements
of
count
1,
which
was
attempted
murder?
justice
kennedy
and
did
he
advise
the
defendant
of
the
baseline
offense
level
for
attempted
murder?
justice
kennedy
but
he
didn't
advise
him
of
the
elements
of
attempted
murder--
justice
kennedy
--so
he
had
no
real
basis
to
know
that
he
was
stipulating
to
attempted
murder,
because
he
wasn't...
at
least
under
rule
11
because
he
wasn't
advised
of
the
elements
of
that
offense.
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
this...
of
this
rule,
isn't
it?
so
the
defendant
has
a
certain
amount
of
notice.
he
specifically
stipulates
that
he's
committed
a
higher
offense.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
think
the
sophisticated
counsel
might
have
been
very
interested
to
know
that
the
judge
was
going
to
consider
the
higher
baseline
offense,
and
that
was
never
advised
in
open
court
until
the
sentence
was
pronounced.
justice
kennedy
mr.
cribari,
are
there
instances
other
than
for
raising
the
base
offense
level
in
which
a
client
would
want
to
stipulate
that
he
committed
a
greater
offense?
does
this
come
up
just
in
the
context
of
the
sentencing
for
the
purposes
of
applying
the
guidelines
or
would
there
be
other
plea
agreements
whereby
he
would
stipulate
that
he
committed
an
offense?
