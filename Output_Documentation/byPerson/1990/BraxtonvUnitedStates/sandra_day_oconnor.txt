justice
o'connor
mr.
cribari,
based
on
the
facts
that
were
admitted
at
the
plea
hearing,
could
the
sentencing
judge
have
imposed
the
same
sentence
by
enhancing
the
sentence
under
the
guidelines
and
reach
the
same
result
that
he
reached
here?
justice
o'connor
but
on
these
facts
he
could
have
achieved
the
same
result
by
another
mechanism.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
you
were
correct
on
the
proposition
that
you
bring
to
us,
at
the
very
least
i
suppose
we
should
remand
to
let
the
trial
judge
determine
if
the
same
sentence
should
be
imposed
on
another
basis.
justice
o'connor
now,
would
you
tell
us
what
the
sentencing
guidelines
commission's
position
is
at
present
on
the
interpretation
of
this
provision?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
mr.
marzen,
if
the
sentencing
guidelines
commission
were
to
adopt
its
proposed
revision
to
the
guidelines,
would
you
be
making...
taking
the
same
position
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
is
it
clear
that
that
is
what
they
are
proposing
to
adopt?
justice
o'connor
no?
