justice
scalia
mr.
cribari,
does...
has
the
sentencing
commission
taken
any...
after
issuing
the
guidelines,
do
they
take
positions
on
their
interpretation
of
what
they've
issued?
i
mean,
any
other
agency
that
we
review
we
especially
give
great
deference
to
their
interpretation
of
their
own
rules.
and
this
is
sort
of
like
a
rule
of
the
guidelines.
i
just
don't
know
how
to
handle
it.
do
they
take
any
positions
on
interpretation
or
is
the
only
thing
they
can
do
is
reenact
a
different
guideline?
they
have
this
under
consideration
right
now,
don't
they?
justice
scalia
and
what
if
they
do?
is
that
retroactive?
do
we
treat
that
as
though
it's
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own...
of
its
own
regulation?
or
is
like
congress'
enactment
of
a
new
statute?
justice
scalia
would
not
be
retro--
justice
scalia
--so
it
would
have
a
retroactive
effect?
justice
scalia
so
it
would
have
a
retroactive
effect?
justice
scalia
but
would
not
be
retroactive?
right.
i
know
what
you
mean.
justice
scalia
what--
--what
precisely
is
the
amendment
that
the
commission
is
considering?
justice
scalia
mr.
cribari,
am
i
correct
that
if
the
commission
adopts
what
they
have
proposed
to
adopt,
your
client
would...
would
win?
is
that...
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
now,
what
if...
what
if
we...
what
if
we
find
against
your
client,
and
then
the
commission
adopts
what
it
has
proposed
to
adopt?
justice
scalia
oh,
but
you
think
we
would
win
though?
justice
scalia
well,
why
not--
justice
scalia
do
we
give
special
weight
to
those
courts
that
have
members
of
the
commission
on
them?
is
that
the--
justice
scalia
--yes,
i
see.
justice
scalia
could
i
ask
the
inverse
situation
of
the
question
i
asked
before?
suppose
we
find,
not
against
your
client,
but
for
your
client.
and
then
the
commission
does
not
adopt
its
proposed
clarification,
but...
well...
either
two
questions.
either
it
doesn't
adopt
the
proposed
clarification.
it
does
nothing.
or
else
it
adopts
just
the
opposite
clarification.
then...
then
what
would
happen?
justice
scalia
would
that
apply
retroactively
to
your
client,
and
he
would
deprived
of
the
victory
that
we
have
given
him?
justice
scalia
so
it's
sort
of
a
one-way
street.
justice
scalia
well,
you
do
agree
they
should
be
treated
like
congress
and
not
like
an
agency?
they're--
justice
scalia
--not
just
interpreting
their
guidelines.
they
are
issuing
a
new
guideline
essentially,
right?
justice
scalia
they
are
not
just
interpreting
a
guideline
the
way
an
agency
does.
they
are
issuing
a
new
guideline.
it's
a...
it's
a
new
enactment.
justice
scalia
mr.
marzen,
why
did
the
stipulation,
using
it
in
your
sense,
the
statement
of
facts
that
the
government
had
proffered,
why
did
that,
within
the
meaning
of
the
guidelines,
specifically
establish
the
more
serious
offense?
did...
did
that
stipulation
establish
intent
to
kill?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
suppose
he
missed?
justice
scalia
mr.
marzen,
suppose
we
took
no
action
on
this
case
or
suppose
we
found
in
your
favor
and
the
guidelines
commission
later
adopted
an
amendment
that
would
favor
the
defendant
here,
would...
would
that
amendment
be
able
to
be
applied
to
the
defendant,
or
is
this
the
end
of
the
road?
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
kicking
out?
suppose...
suppose...
suppose
the
case
were
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
what...
would
the
case
still
be
kicking
about
or
would
that
be
the
end
of
it?
justice
scalia
2255.
we
didn't
decide
what
the
rule
meant.
and
he
wanted
us
to
decide
what
the
rule
meant.
you
know,
why
couldn't
he
go
to
2255
and
say,
look,
the
district...
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
wrong?
justice
scalia
maybe
i'd
better
follow
along
in
the
text
here.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
you...
have
you
preserved
that
point
or
did
you
first
raise
it
in
your
reply
brief...
namely
that
this
stipulation
did
not
specifically
establish
a
more
serious
offense.
have
you
preserved
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
cribari,
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
did
not
stipulate
to
the
intent,
but
have
you
preserved
on
appeal
the
fact
that
this
sentence
was
invalid
because
the
stipulation
did
not
specifically
establish
the
more
serious
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
four
united
states
marshals
arrived
at
thomas
braxton’s
door
with
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
they
knocked
but
there
was
no
answer,
though
they
could
hear
somebody
inside.
they
got
a
key
to
the
apartment,
knocked
again,
unlocked
the
door,
and
finding
it
secured
with
a
chain
lock
from
the
inside,
kicked
the
door
open.
as
it
opened,
the
gunshot
was
fired
and
a
bullet
lodged
in
the
door
just
above
the
doorknob,that
is
the
outside
of
the
door.
the
door
slammed
shut
and
the
officers
withdrew.
a
moment
later,
they
again
kicked
the
door
open.
another
shot
was
fired.
this
too,
lodging
in
the
front
of
the
door
about
five
feet
from
the
floor.
the
officers
again
withdrew
and
the
area
was
barricaded.
braxton,
who
had
fired
the
shots,
eventually
gave
himself
up
and
was
charged
in
a
three-count
indictment
with
(1)
an
attempt
to
kill
a
deputy
united
states
marshal,
(2)
assault
on
a
deputy
marshal,
and
(3)
the
use
of
a
firearm
during
a
crime
of
violence.
these
were
the
facts
presented
by
the
government
during
the
plea
hearing.
braxton
agreed
to
those
facts
as
the
government
presented
them,
and
pleaded
guilty
to
the
last
two
charges,
assault
and
firearm
charges.
he
did
not,
however,
plead
guilty
to
the
attempted
murder
charge.
and
his
plea
was
not
pursuant
to
any
agreement
with
the
government.
nonetheless,
at
sentencing,
the
district
court
sentenced
braxton
in
effect
as
though
he
had
pleaded
guilty
to
attempted
murder.
relying
on
a
provision
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
that
allows
the
judge
to
sentence
a
defendant
to
an
offense
greater
than
the
one
to
which
he
pleaded
guilty,
is
the
plea
contains
“a
stipulation
that
specifically
establishes
a
more
serious
offense
than
the
offensive
conviction.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction
here
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
while
we
have
originally
granted
review
in
this
case
because
of
a
split
in
the
circuits’
over
the
meaning
of
the
word
stipulation
in
the
guideline
provisions
i
quoted.
we
have
chosen
not
to
resolve
the
case
on
that
ground.
after
we
granted
review,
the
sentencing
commission
began
an
amendment
process
that
could
lead
to
a
clarification
of
the
guideline
on
that
point.
in
our
view,
the
commission
is
congress’
chosen
body
for
resolving
splits
in
the
interpretation
of
the
guidelines,
and
we
will
differ
to
it
here
where
we
can
resolve
the
case
on
another
ground.
even
if
an
agreement
to
facts
presented
at
a
plea
hearing
constitutes
a
stipulation,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
stipulation
in
this
case
specifically
establishes
which
is
what
the
guideline
requires,
specifically
establishes
that
braxton
attempted
to
murder
anyone.
at
best,
the
stipulation
is
ambiguous
if
the
bullets
hit
the
door
as
described,
that
is
lodged
in
the
front
of
an
inward-opening
door,
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
conclude
that
braxton
was
shooting
at
the
marshals
unless
it
was
also
stipulated
that
the
marshals
had
entered
the
room.
that
was
not
stipulated,
and
even
if
it
was,
that
would
still
not
show
that
braxton
had
shot
at
the
marshals
with
the
intent
of
killing
them.
not
only
is
there
nothing
from
which
that
essential
element
could
be
inferred,
but
braxton
explicitly
denied
it
at
the
hearing.
he
claims
to
have
intended
only
to
frighten
the
martials
and
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
his
stipulation.
to
constitute
a
stipulation
that
specifically
establishes
an
intent
to
kill
something
more
than
what
we
have
here
is
required.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
