mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
the
guidelines
provide
defendants
who
want
to
plead
guilty
two
ways
to
respond
to
the
government's
factual
proffer.
first,
if
the
proffer
is
accurate,
they
can
agree
to
it.
if
they
come
clean,
they
will
most
likely
get
a
two--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
sir,
rule
11,
basically
the
satisfaction
of
the
requirement
in
rule
11(f)
that
there
be
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
it's...
the
defendant
can
of
course
himself
state
the
facts
that
support
the
plea,
but
it's
often
the
case
that
the
district
court
will
ask
the
government
what
it
would
be
able
to
prove
if
it
went
to
trial.
and
that's
the
situation
that
arose
in
this
case.
so
that
in
this
circumstance
he
had
under
the
guidelines
two
options.
he
could
agree
to
that
factual
proffer--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
guidelines
don't
have
any...
don't
dictate
the
procedure
at
a
rule
11
hearing.
they
do
have
different
consequences...
different
consequences
attach
depending
on
what
the
defendant
does
at
the
rule
11
hearing.
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--with
respect,
i
think
guide...
the
language
of
guideline
1b1.2
does
have
that
effect,
and
in
particular
the
proviso.
guideline
1b1.2
requires
the
sentencing
to...
determination
generally
to
be
based
on
the
offense--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--of
conviction
except
in
one
case.
and
that
case
is
the
so-called
proviso,
which
applies
when
three
conditions
are
met.
first,
there
has
to
be
a
plea,
a
plea
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere,
which
implies
that,
you
know,
the
requirements
of
rule
11
have
been
satisfied.
second,
that
there
has
to
be
a
stipulation.
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--right.
the
plea
has
to
contain
a
stipulation,
and
that's
where
rule
11
ties
in.
at
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--okay.
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
that
the
plea
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere
has
to,
as
you
state,
contain
the
stipulation.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
at
the
plea
hearing
and
not
later...
for
example...
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
it
has
to
be
at
the
plea
hearing
there
has
to
be
the
agreement
to
the
facts,
setting
up
the
more
serious
offense.
it...
what
the
guidelines
forbid
is
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
defendant
saying,
i
did
x,
y,
and
z.
and
then
that
the
district
court
saying,
well,
i
think
that's
attempted
murder
and
that's
what
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
on.
it's
got
to
be
at
the
plea
hearing
specifically.
what--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--if
the
sentencing
commission
required
a
plea
agreement,
we
would
not.
it
would
be...
it
would
be
clear
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
and
that's
the
second--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--part
i'd
like
to
say.
there's
no
explicit
language
that
has
been
proposed
with
respect
to
any
amendment
of
rule
1b1.2.
they're
asking
for
comments
whether
they
should
expressly
provide
that
they'll
be
a
plea
agreement.
in
other
words,
there's
been
no
determination
at
this
stage
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
sentencing
commission
want
to
amend
the
current
guideline
to
require
that
a
plea
agreement
be
a
predicate
for
application
of
the
proviso.
there's
one
additional
fact
that
the
court
should
note.
i
had
been
informed
within
the
past
week
or
so
that
the
commission
has
in
a
public
meeting
voted
to
defer
consideration
of
any
amendment
to
the
proviso
pending
the
court's
decision
in
this
case.
[laughter]
what
that
means...
by
statute
under
28
u.s.c.
994,
there
are
certain
statutory
time
limits
the
commission
has
to
operate
under.
they
have
to
submit
all
of
their
amendments,
if
they
have
any
this
year,
by
may
1st.
so
if
the
court
makes
no
decision
by
may
1st,
effectively
what
that
means
is
that
there
will
be
no
amendment
to
the
guidelines
this
year.
that
may
influence
some
decision
you
may
want
to
take.
under
the
guideline
as
it's
currently
written,
what
petitioner
braxton
had
was
two
choices.
one
choice
was
to
agree
to
the
government's
factual
proffer,
agree
that
he
took
personal
and
affirmative
responsibility
for
his
criminal
conduct.
and
in
all
likelihood
he
would
have
gotten
a
2-point
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
go...
it
goes
along
with
that
acceptance
of
the
government's
facts,
that
if
those
facts
established
a
more
serious
offense,
the
relevant
guideline
for
calculation
of
his
sentence
would
have
been
the
more
serious
offense...
in
this
case,
the
guideline
for
attempted
murder.
if
petitioner
had
wanted
to
avoid
the
higher
guideline,
he
had
a
second
choice
under
the
guidelines.
he
could
simply
have
said,
government,
i
don't
agree
with
that
factual
proffer.
or
i
don't
have
time
to
read
the
in
and
outs
of
it
now,
but
i
don't
agree
with
it.
and
here's
my
own
version
of
what
the
facts
were.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
think
it
is.
but
at
this...
at
this
stage
that's
the
most
difficult
thing
to...
to
talk
about,
because
the
legal
arguments
why
it
didn't
appear
for
the
most
part
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief.
but
let
me
respond
to
your
question,
because
i
do
think
they
did
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
facts
showed
a
specific
intent
to
murder.
and
in
this
case,
i
need
to
correct
one
factual
misstatement
on
petitioner's
side.
and
that
is
that
the
shots
were
fired
at
the
marshals,
at
chest
and
head
level,
through
the
opening
in
the
doorway.
petitioner's
submission
is
basically
that
he
was
only
trying
to
use
the
gunshots
to
frighten
the
marshals
away,
sort
of
firing
in
the
air
and
say,
don't
come
into
my
apartment.
the
problem
is
that
no
threats
were
made
of
don't
come
into
my
apartment
before
the
shots
were
fired.
the
marshals
kicked
open
the
door
and
at
that
point,
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix
indicates,
and
i
quote,
"a
gunshot
was
fired
through
the
door
opening.
"
and
later
on
in
the
same
page,
quote,
"a
second
gunshot
was
fired,
again
through
the
door
opening.
"
you
don't
fire
a
warning
shot
at
someone's
head
or
chest.
it's...
the
warning
is
fatal
basically.
second,
even
if
you
credit
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--you
know,
he
must
have
been
a
horrible
shot,
justice
stevens.
because
it's
true
that
the
marshal--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
because--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
think...
i
think
it
must...
it
must
be
a
must
find,
if
you
will.
and
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
and
in
this
case
the
district
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
found
that
the
facts
compelled
a
finding
of
attempted
murder
and
that
finding
by
the
district
court
was
upheld
on
a...
on
appeal.
it--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
don't
think
so,
and
i
think
again
the
language
of
guideline...
the...
specifically
the
proviso
provides
the
answer
to
your
question.
the
point...
the
part
we're
talking
about
now...
now
is
not
the
stipulation
part.
it's
the
part
that
requires
that
the
stipulation
be
one
that,
quote,
"specifically
establishes
a
more
serious
offense
than
the
offense
of
conviction.
"
it
doesn't--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
it's
more
than--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--true.
he
didn't
agree
with
that
conclusion.
what
he...
what
in
fact
is
happening
in
this
case
is
petitioner
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
in
this
sense.
he's
trying
to
agree
to
all
the
facts
of
his
conduct
and
get
a
two-level
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility
but
say
that
those
facts
can't
be
used
to
apply
a
higher
guideline.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
don't
think
that
would
change
the
result
in
this
case
because
it
doesn't
change
the
agreement
to
the
historical
facts.
it
may
well
be
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
insufficient.
i
shouldn't
say
may
well
be.
i
think
the
district
court
was
right
to
find
that
these
facts
compelled
a
finding
of
malice
of
forethought.
if
you
disagreed
with
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
think
it's
important
the
language
you
quote
says
specifically
establish
and
not...
and
it
does
not
say
stipulate
to
the
offense.
the
guideline
makes
pretty
clear
that
the
stipulation
need
only
specifically
establish
the
offense
and
not
be
a...
an
agreement
to
the
conclusion
that
i
did
commit
the
offense.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
it
means
either...
that's
exactly
right.
it
means
a
stipulation
to
the
facts
or
the
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
chief
justice.
application
note
2
uses
those
interchangeably.
it
talks
about
application
of
the
proviso
to
cases
in
which
either
the
facts
prove
the
more
serious
offense
or
the
elements
of
the
more
serious
offense
are
established.
so
it...
yes,
it
does.
it
uses
those
synonymously.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's
a...
that
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
their
position.
in
fact,
his
last...
petitioner's
counsel's
last
comments
before
sitting
down
were
that
even
if
he
agreed
to
all
the
elements
of
the
offense
that
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to
trigger
application
of
the
higher
guideline.
what
you
have
then
is
the
case
where
someone
is
able
to
go
before
a
district
court
and
say,
i
agree
there's
an
offer.
there's
consideration,
and
there's
acceptance,
and
i
should
get
a
two-level
reduction
for
accepting
that
those
were
the
facts
of
the
arrangement.
but
you
can't
make
your...
any
determination
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
contract
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
for
this
purpose?
no.
and
i
think
petitioner--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--there
was
indeed,
justice
marshall.
and
that's
why--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--they're
the
same
thing,
justice
marshall.
we
agree
with
that.
and
the
definition
that
petitioner
provides
in
both
the
opening
and
reply
brief
is
one--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
absolutely
right,
that
the
definition
of
a
stipulation,
according
to
black's
law
dictionary,
the
ordinary
definition,
is
the
name,
quote,
"the
name
given
to
any
agreement
made
by
attorneys
regulating
any
matter
incidental
to
the
proceedings.
"
petitioner
agrees
that
stipulation
means
an
agreement
and
that
he
agreed
to
the
government's
factual
proffer.
at
page
19
in
the
joint
appendix
he
says,
quote,
"your
honor,
we
agree",
close
quote,
that
the
government's
factual
proffer
is
accurate,
with
two
exceptions.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
justice
rehnquist,
if
it
was
just
a
deduction...
if
it
was
just
something
that
a
jury
would
be
permitted
to
conclude,
it
is
not
enough.
specifically
establish
means
it's
got
to
be
conclusive,
necessary,
or
in
the
words
of
the
district
court,
compelled.
i
think
the
facts
in
this
case
compelled
it.
and
i
was
only
able
to
give
one
of
my
reasons
why.
the
second
reason
was
even...
you
don't
have
to
assume
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--you
don't
have
to
indulge
the
assumption
that
mr.
braxton
is
a
poor
marksman.
the
common
law
has
also
allowed
as
an
interpretation
of
malice
of
forethought
the
sort
of...
the
so-called
depraved
heart
theory
of
intent...
just
reckless
disregard.
and
firing
two
shots
through
an
open
doorway,
behind
which
marshals
stood,
is
at
the
very
least
in
reckless
disregard.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
sir,
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
actually--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--there
are
two
points
here.
one
is
where
petitioner
aimed
the
shots,
and
the
second
is
where
the
shots
landed.
petitioners
and
his
counsel
agreed
to
the
proffer
which
says
that
those
shots
were
basically
aimed
through
the
doorway
but
lodged
in
the
door.
remember
the
door
was
being
kicked
open
at
the
time
the
shots
were
fired.
so
we
have
in
this
case,
as
i
quoted,
the
record
establishes
that
the
shots
were
fired--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--it's...
it's
true.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
the
first
bullet
did.
the
second
bullet
did
not.
the
second
bullet
lodged
approximately
5
feet
high
in
the
door
and--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
record
doesn't
establish
whether
the
second
shot
hit
on
what
was
the
inside
door
of
the
apartment
or
the
outside.
the
record
only
indicates
that
the
first
bullet
hit
on
the
outside
of
the
door
after
it
had
been
kicked
open.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
because
the
record
also
shows...
shows
that
the
door
was
kicked
open
the
first
time
with
such
force
that
it
snapped
shut.
the
marshal--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
proffer
indicated
that
the
deputy
had
to
kick
it
open
a
second
time.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
when
the
marshal
kicked
open
the
door
the
second
time,
the...
the
initial
proffer
anyway
was
that
the
government...
that
another
shot
was
fired.
what
this
indicates
though
is
that
these
kinds
of
factual
determinants
are
probably
best
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
who
was
there
and
could
tell--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
he
did
not.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no,
the
proffer
was
given
at
the
rule
11
hearing,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
rule
11
now
requires
that
one
advise...
that
the
judge
advise
the
defendant
that
the
guidelines
apply
but
not
the
specific
range
or
any
of
the
particular
points.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
think
i
see
where
you're
driving.
the
fear
i
guess
is
that
the
defendant
might
be
agreeing
to
something
without
knowing
the
consequences.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
notice...
the
defendant
had
sufficient
notice
in
this
case
for
two
reasons.
one,
he...
petitioner
braxton
was
represented
by
a
very
able
counsel
who
knew
the
guidelines
and
also
knew,
as
indicated
on
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
facts
of
attempted
murder
might
well
be
used
to
determine
the
guideline
applicable.
in
other
words,
to
determine
that
the
attempted
murder
guideline
applied.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
it
was
never
advised
that
he
would,
but
defense
counsel
was
certainly
on
notice
that
he
could.
and
that's...
and
that
gave
him
the
ability
to
go
into
the
rule
11
hearing
and
either
agree
or
disagree
with
the
stipulation
with
his
eyes
open.
second...
and
this
is
also
important...
defendants
in
general
are
not
going
to
lightly
agree
to
aggravating
circumstances
as
part
of
satisfying
the
factual
basis
for
a
guilty
plea
because
other
things
turn
on
it
besides
deciding
which
guideline
applies.
the
sentencing
judge
in
all
cases
will
still
have
the
decision
where
within
the
guideline's
range
to
sentence
the
defendant.
that
is
an
enormous
incentive
right
there
to
make...
to
not
agree
to
aggravating
circumstances
because
you
want
your
client
to
see
the
sentence
at
the
low
end
of
the
guideline.
in
addition,
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
the
government's
factual
proffer
are
grave
enough,
they
might
well
form
the
basis
for
a
departure
later
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
that
would
be
another
reason
why,
if
anything,
defense
counsel
would
want
to
minimize
the
admission
to
any
facts
that
don't
necessarily
prove
that
he
committed
a
worse
offense.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
think
the
answer
turns
on
whether
there
is...
this
case
is
still
kicking
around
the
courts.
if
the
sentence
is
still
open,
i
think
it
would
be
a
procedural
amendment
and
would
well
apply
retroactively.
if
the
sentence
has
already
been
meted
out
and
the
time
for
appeal
has
passed,
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
procedural
mechanism
to
get
a
different
sentence,
i
think.
so
i
think,
yes,
the
sentencing--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
the
district
court
on
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
has
already
determined
that
because
of
petitioner's
agreement
to
the
facts
that...
of
the
criminal
conduct...
he
was
entitled
to
a
two-point
reduction.
the
only
issue
left
is
the
issue
of
what
is
the
definition
of
stipulation.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
must
confess...
confess
i'm
not
sure
that
under
2255
that
you're...
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
every
procedural
updating
of
a
sentencing
guideline.
it
would
be
a
rather
dangerous
thing
for
this
court--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--not
to
my
knowledge.
i
haven't
seen
any
judicial
decision
which
has
used
it
in
that
way.
the
usual
mechanisms
for
correcting
it
are
an
appeal
within
10
days
or
a
post-sentencing
hearing
motion
in
the
district
court,
and
that's
about
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
petitioner's
principal
submission
in
the
briefs
and
in
this
court
is
that
the
stipulation
requires
a
plea
agreement.
and
i'd
like
to
address
that.
first,
the
proviso
specifies
the
scope
of
the...
of
the
proviso.
it
applies,
quote,
"in
a
case
of
a
conviction
by
plea
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere--
"
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--contendere...
i
apologize.
petitioner
has
to
add
a
word,
the
word
"agreement",
to
the
proviso
in
order
to
effect
the
interpretation
he
proposes
to
this
court,
which
is
a
fairly
significant
reason
counseling
that
that
is
not
what
the
guideline
means.
in
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
word
containing
i
think
is
consistent
with
the...
yes,
it
does
modify
the
word
"plea".
and
i
think
supports
our
interpretation.
black's
law
dictionary
defines
plea
of
guilty
to
include
not
just
the
plea
itself,
guilty,
not
guilty,
nolo
contendere,
but
also
to
include
the,
quote,
"confession
of
guilt".
petitioner's
confession,
his
agreement
to
the
government's
factual
proffer,
may
contain
a
stipulation
to
a
more
serious
offense.
if
you--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no,
the
plea
of
guilty
does
have
to
contain
it,
but
the
plea
includes
more
than
just
the
formal
guilty,
not
guilty,
or
nolo
contendere.
it
also
includes
the
confession
of
guilt
or
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea
in
common
legal
parlance.
if
you--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
the...
i
don't--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
it's
a...
it
is...
it
should
be
a
unilateral
act
in
that
it
should
be
coming
clean
with
what
criminal
conduct
you
did.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
you...
oh,
i
see.
you
can
have
a
unilateral
act
and
have
it
still
be
an
agreement
even
though
there's
no
consideration
for
it.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
bargain
for
exchange
in
other
words.
the
defendant
can
agree
to
what...
that
he
committed
the
offense
for
which
he
was
indicted
and
agree
that
the
facts
satisfied
the...
a
factual
basis
for
that
without
the
government
having
to
specifically
propose
something
on
the
other
side.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
justice
marshall,
it's
usually
more--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--no.
in
this
case,
though--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
in...
for
purposes
of
the
proviso,
the
stipulation
has
benefits
for
the
government
and
benefits
for
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
if
you
want
to
view
it
in
contractual
terms,
it's
sort
of
like
a...
the...
there's
sort
of
a
unilateral
contract
where
you...
where
you
specifically
give
out
an
offer
without
anyone
specific--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
trap,
because
the
defendant
knows
that
if
he
provides
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea
that
establishes
a
more
serious
offense
that
certain
sentencing
consequences
will
attach.
he
also,
by
doing
so
gets
the
benefit
of
other
sentencing
consequences,
namely
the
two-level
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
so
it's
not...
it's
not
really
a...
a
trap
in
general.
and
it
wasn't
a
trap
in
this
case.
petitioner's
counsel
knew
that
there
was
lurking
in
the
background
an
attempted
murder
and
knew
that
those
facts
might
well
be
used
to
choose
the
attempted
murder
guideline.
that's
in
fact
what
happened.
it
may
have
been
his
worst
fear,
but
he
did
get
some
benefits
from
that.
he
got
a
two-level
reduction
on
remand.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
two
reasons...
to
achieve
a
two-level
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
that's
equivalent
to
a
20
to
30
percent
decrease
in
his
sentence.
second,
it
allowed
him
to
limit
his
statutory
exposure,
the
maximum
offense
to
which
he
would...
could
be
sentenced,
to
10
years
rather
than
20
years.
those
were
the...
those
were
the
benefits
he
got.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
true,
and
as
my
answer
to
that,
justice--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
that's...
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
it
was,
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
had
the
recommendation
of
using
the
attempted
murder
guideline?
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
the
answer
is
yes,
and
it
appears
in
two
ways.
first,
the
prosecutor
suggested
that...
that
there
was
a
tacit
plea
bargain,
and
that
if
the
attempted
murder
or...
if
petitioner
was
sentenced
based
on
the
attempted
murder,
they
would
be
induced
to
drop
the
charge.
second,
and
perhaps
since
it's
arisen
so
much,
i'd
just
quote
briefly
the
language
on
page
22,
where
petitioner's
counsel
states,
"nevertheless,
we've
explained
to
mr.
braxton
that
you're
going
to
consider
all
these
facts
in
determining
a
sentence,
both
considering
them
under
the
guideline
to
determine
the
guideline.
"
--i.e.,
the
facts...
whether
they
established
attempted
murder
to
determine
whether
to
use
the
attempted
murder
guideline.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i'm
sorry,
the
alienation
is
mine.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
everything
up
to
the
i.e.--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--comma--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
it
would
make
my
job
a
lot
easier
if
it
were
in
there.
[laughter]
and--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
justice
scalia,
if
you
want
to
follow
me,
it's
at
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix...
the
first
sentence
in
the
second
paragraph
beginning
on
that
page.
"nevertheless,
we've
explained
to
mr.
braxton
that
you're
going
to
consider
all
these
facts
in
determining
the
sentence,
both
considering
them
under
the
guideline
to
determine
the
guideline,
and
considering
them
for
any
departures
under
the
guideline.
"
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
it--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i
read
that
sentence
as
expanding
on
the
subordinate
clause
in
the
second
part
of
the
first
sentence.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no,
he's...
petitioner
certainly
would
have
like
getting
a
sentence
based
on
the
assault
guideline
and
not
having
a
departure.
but
given
the
facts
of
the
offense
and
how
grave
they
were,
that
just
wasn't
the
likely
possibility.
and
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
district
court
said
that
he
would
in
fact
depart
upward...
not
might,
but
would...
up
to
the
exact
same
level
that
was
dictated
by
the
attempted
murder
guideline.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no.
