mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
sentencing
guidelines
case
of
some
consequence
to
criminal
defendants
and
practitioners
of
criminal
law.
as
you
know
the
sentencing
guidelines
implement
a
charge
offense
system
of
sentencing.
under
the
guidelines
a
defendant
expects
to
be
sentenced
or
the
offense
or
offenses
for
which
he
is
convicted.
there
are
defined
exceptions
to
that
general
rule,
and
the
guideline
at
issue
in
this
case
contains
one
of
those
exceptions.
the
exception
is
that
when
a
defendant
enters
a
guilty
plea
containing
a
stipulation
which
establishes
an
offense
more
serious
than
the
offense
of
conviction,
that
defendant
can
expect
his
base
offense
level
or,
if
you
will,
his
presumptive
sentence,
to
be
based
on
the
stipulated
offense,
not
the
offense
of
conviction.
the
issue
in
mr.
braxton's
case
is
whether
the
technical
term
"stipulation"
can
be
so
broadly
interpreted
that
a
defendant
who
refuses
to
stipulate,
who
makes
it
clear
on
the
record
that
he
does
not
intend
the
stipulation,
denies
committing
the
more
serious
offense,
and
keeps
in
issue
an
essential
element
of
that
offense
may
nevertheless
be
found
to
have
stipulated
because
he
acknowledges
the
government's
factual
proffer
on
the
offenses
to
which
he
intends
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
came
up
in
the
extremely
ordinary
fashion
of
turning
to
the
government
at
the
appropriate
time
during
the
rule
11
inquiry
and
asking
for
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
the
government
proffered
what
its
facts
would
be...
had...
would
the
case
go
to
trial,
and
mr.
braxton
acknowledged
those
facts
as
acts
that
he
did.
at
the
same
time
he
maintained
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
anybody.
it
is
clear
in
the
statement
of
facts
that
the
government
proffered,
that
mr.
braxton,
who
has
been
on
a
community
release
from
a
mental
hospital,
had
stopped
reporting
for
his
medication.
the
marshals
had
been
dispatched
to
bring
him
back.
when
they
identified
who
they
were
and
why
they
were
there,
he
then
threatened
them.
he
refused
to
go
back.
and
when
they
kicked
his
door
open,
he
fired
shots
at
the
door.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
factually
that
mr.
braxton...
and
the
evidence
would
be
clear
on
this...
did
not
fire
through
the
opening
of
the
door
at
the
people
outside.
the
bullets
lodged
in
the
outside
of
the
door.
so
that
when
the
door
was
kicked
open,
shots
were
fired
across
toward
the
open
door,
hitting
the
outside
of
the
door.
the
door
then
closed.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
about
how
that
happened?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
the
door
had
a
chain
guard
on
it.
and
one
of
the
marshals
kicked
the
door
open
so
that
it
snapped
open
into
the
apartment.
the
shots
were
then
fired
and
lodged
in
the...
what
would
be
the
front
of
that
door...
which
they
could
only
do
had
the
shots
been
fired
across
the
front
of
the
apartment
toward
what
was
now
the
open
face
of
the
door.
in
other
words,
they
were
fired
perpendicularly
to
the
opening
of
the
door.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
none
were
fired
before
the
door
was
kicked
open.
the
words
were
exchanged.
and
when
the
door
was
kicked
open,
the
shots
were
fired.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
think
it's
clear
he
intended
to
assault
the
marshals
by
this
act
to
frighten
them
away...
to
say,
i
am
not
going
back
to
the
mental
hospital.
if
you...
he
went
to
so
far
as
to
threaten,
if
you
come
in,
i'll
kill
you.
i
mean,
there
were
overt
threats
made.
but
at
the
time
the
proffer
was
made
by
the
government,
what
mr.
braxton
said
and
what
he
said
at
sentencing
was,
i
did
not
intend
to
kill
those
people.
i
intended
not
to
go
back
to
st.
elizabeth's.
i
intended
to
frighten
them.
i
did
not
intend
killing.
now--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
it's
certainly
possible,
but
what's
at
issue
is
the
manner
of
doing
it.
and
under
the
guidelines,
the
manner
of
doing
it
is
crucial.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
hesitate
to
say,
categorically,
yes.
the
answer
is
he
could
do
it.
but
the
answer
also
is
that
in
doing
so,
he
would
have
to
engage
in
a
departure
analysis.
and
engaging
in
a
departure
analysis,
the
courts
have
been
fairly
clear
that
all
departures,
upward
or
downward,
have
to
be
structured.
we've
developed
the
term
"guided
departures".
at--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--we
would
happily
take
that
hearing,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that's
the
correct
procedure
that
has
to
happen.
you
have
to
start
from
the
base
offense
level
for
the
aggravated
assault,
and
you
have
to
engage
in
discussion
as
to
why
the
next
level
is
not
appropriate,
why
the
next
level...
and
why
this
sentence
would
be
acceptable.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
this
stipulation
provision?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
your
honor,
i
think
the
sentencing
guidelines
interpretation
is
fairly
clear.
under
1b1.2
in
the
commentary,
the
sentencing
commission
cites
to
a
house
report
which
is
the
subject
of
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
that
refers
to
stipulations
of
this
nature
being
contained
in
plea
agreements.
there's
not
a
specific
discussion
that
they
should
be
in
writing
necessarily,
but
that
they
should
be
part
of
a
plea
agreement.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
they
do.
they
have
under
consideration
a
proposed
amendment
to
this
guideline
questioning
whether
it
should
be
made
specifically
clear
in
the
guideline
as
part
of
the
black
letter
law
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
i
think
the
commission
take
the
position
that
these
would
clarifying
amendments
which
would
be
effective
at
the
time
anyone
would
be
sentenced
under
them
and
would
have
no
retroactive
effect
in--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
if
it's
a
clarifying
amendment,
all
it's
doing
is
making
more
clear
what
once
was
the
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
excuse
me;
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
would
have
a
retroactive
effect
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
a
retroactive
offense...
effect
in
the
sense
that
it
is
making
clear
what
has
always
been
the
case.
but
i
don't
think
people
who
have
already
been
sentenced
could
have
all
of
their
sentences
reheard
because
some...
the
law
had
been
changed
in
a
way
that
would
have
a
benefit
to
those
people.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
the
commission's
amendment
reads
as
follows,
and
it's
extremely
short:
proposed
amendment
to
1b1.2,
regard...
which
regards
stipulations
to
more
serious
offense
should
be
amended
to
provide
expressly
that
such
stipulation
must
be
part
of
a
formal
plea
agreement.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
that
is
what
it
is
soliciting
comment
on
doing.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
there
was
no
plea
agreement
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there
was
no
plea
agreement
of
any
kind.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
think
the
better
practice
is
written,
and
i
think
the
rules...
at
least
the
local
rules
of
the
district
court
in
maryland
would
require
in
the
felony
situation
that
we
have
a
written
agreement.
i'm
not
sure
it
needs
to
be
written.
i
think
the
second
circuit
in
mccall
has
said
that,
whether
written
or
oral,
it
must
be
formal
and
must
be
part
of
a
plea
agreement.
of
course,
what's
ultimately
at
issue
is
will
a
defendant
be
sentenced
presumptively
to
a
base
offense
level
for
an
offense
that
he
does
not
acknowledge
committing.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
that's
accurate.
since--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--your
honor,
that
puts
me
in
the
awkward
position
of
saying
perhaps
my
client
then
should
file
some
kind
of
2255
alleging
my
ineffectiveness
for
not
foreseeing
that
that
would
be
the
case
for
him.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i...
you
would
have
a
situation
where
the
commission
will
have
changed
the
guidelines,
or...
sorry...
where
the
commission
will
have
clarified
guidelines
in
a
way
opposite
to
what
this
court
could
do
in
this
case.
certainly,
you
have
a
situation
where
that
would
be
concededly
unfair
to
a
defendant.
and
hopefully
there
could
be
some
kind
of
review.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
but
if
the
commission's
adoption
would
be
a
clarifying
amendment--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
certainly
the
commission...
if
this
court
found
a...
in
the
government's
favor
in
this
case...
the
commission
could
enact
the
guideline
or
reenact
the
guideline
or
amend
the
guideline
to
make
it
consistent
with
my
position.
the
question
is
what
happens
to
mr.
braxton
in
the
meantime?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
he's
already
there,
and
i
think
he
stays
there.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
and
i
don't
think
he
gets
the
benefit
of...
of
the
commission's
amending
a
guideline
once
this
court
concludes
this
case
against
him,
if
it
were
to
do
that.
but
to
conclude
this
case
against
mr.
braxton,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
say
that
mr.
braxton,
who
proclaimed
his
innocence
of
a
stipulated
offense,
nevertheless
stipulated
to
that
offense.
i--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--there
was
not,
your
honor.
i'll
be
happy
to
say
why.
we
had
won
one
portion
of
the
appeal
in
this
case.
on
the
acceptance
of
responsibility
issue
the
trial
court
had
ruled
that
mr.
braxton
could
not
get
it
to
a
level
of
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility
because
he
frankly
was
insane...
could
not
show
remorse
for
his
actions.
remorse
was
necessary
to
show
rehabilitation,
and
rehabilitation
was
necessary
to
get
the
benefit
of
acceptance
of
responsibility.
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
that's
not
true,
that
rehabilitation
has
nothing
to
do
with
incarceration,
and
at
least
in
the
incarceration
sentence
a
defendant
need
not
show
a
step
toward
rehabilitation
to
show
that
he
accepts
responsibility.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
it
would
have,
your
honor.
i
think
you
can
get
that
from
his
low
review
article.
and
i
think
you
can
understand
where
judge
wilkins
stands
from
the
proposed
amendment,
which
was
proposed
after
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
braxton,
and
certainly
he
would
not
have
been
ware
of
that
sitting
on
that
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
your
honor,
i...
we
tried
that
in
mistretta
i
think.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
and...
and
it
was
not
particularly
availing.
i
think
you
give
weight
to
expert
judges
in
light
of
what
their
expertise
is.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
just
because
judge
wilkins
wrote
a
law
review
article,
taking
a
certain
position,
that
therefore
that's
the
position
of
the
commission,
and
this
is
a
pronouncement
that
you
must
defer
to.
but
you
certainly
can
be
aware
of
who
judge
wilkins
is
and
what
the
low
review
article
is
all
about.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
then--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
at
that
point
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that's
really
no
different
than
the
cases
where
this
court
says
you
cannot
be
convicted
of
bank
robbery
by
intimidation
with
a
gun,
and
then
use...
or
hand
gun
offense
and
bank
robbery
by
armed
robbery.
and
then
congress
turns
around
and
changes
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
people
in
the
interstices
get
any
benefit
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
they
are
laws.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
they
are
not?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
to
the
extent
that
they
issue
a
new
guideline,
they...
i
mean,
there's
a
period
where
they
would
have
to
be...
could
be
vetoed
and
so
forth.
but
to
the
extent
that
they
merely
clarify,
i
wonder
if
they're
issuing
in
fact
a
new
substantive
law
or
whether
they're
just
clarifying
an
old
one.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
for
my
case
i
do
not.
i
think
for
this
case--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
we
could.
it
could
be
a
new
guideline.
it
could
be
a
clarification,
but
it's
going
to
affect
the
people
in
the
future.
for
this
case,
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
affect
mr.
braxton
one
way
or
the
other
once
this
court
decides
this
case,
if
for
no
other
reason
there's
no
procedural
vehicle
to
get
him
back
into
court
once
this
court
decides
the
case.
for
the
people
in
the
future,
there
will
be
notice.
it
will
be
there.
it
can
be
read,
and
proceedings
can
be...
can
happen
accordingly.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
comment
is
due
by...
i
think
it's
by
may
1st,
and
there
would
be
amendments
probably
in
june.
it's
possible
the
commission
could
pass
an
amendment
while
this
court
is
considering
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it's
very
possible.
i
understand
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
your
honor,
given...
given
the
legislative
history
and
judge
wilkins'
comments,
i...
it
would
not
trouble
me
if
the
court
waited
for
that
amendment.
i
don't
think
the
commission
will
take
the
position.
i
think
it
would
be
unexpected
for
the
commission
to
take
the
contrary
position,
saying
that
the
decision
in
braxton
is
what
the
law
ought
to
be,
in
effect,
telling
the
second
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
other
circuits
that
you
don't
need
formal
stipulations.
i
think
the
word
stipulation
in
1b1.2
is
a
formal,
technical
term.
it
doesn't
say
a
plea
in
which
the
defendant
agrees
to
certain
facts.
it
doesn't
say
a
plea
in
which
a
defendant
acknowledges
an
offense
greater
than
the
offense
at
conviction.
it
says,
"a
plea
in
which
the
defendant
stipulates.
"
and
i
think...
even
in
the
government's
brief...
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
what
a
stipulation
is.
it
is
a...
certainly
an
agreement,
and
it
is
an
agreement
between
the
parties...
that's
the
government
and
the
defense.
i
think
judge
sprouse
was
correct
in
the
fourth
circuit
when
he
said,
the
stipulation
envisions
an
agreement
between
the
defendant
and
the
government.
without
that
agreement...
without
that
assurance
that
the
defendant
knows
he
is
admitting
to
greater
offense
conduct...
you
can't
turn
around
and
say
your
presumptive
sentence
is
based
on
an
offense
you
deny
committing.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
the...
the
attorneys
representing
the
parties
could
certainly
do
it.
i
think
being
an
attorney
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
representing
the
government--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--my
point
is
that
without
a
formal
agreement
between
the
parties
or
between
the
lawyers
representing
the
parties,
the
government
should
not
be
a
position
of
coming
to
court,
making
its
factual
proffer,
having
a
defendant
acknowledge,
that's
what
i
did
for
purposes
of
what
i
want
to
plead
guilty
to,
and
then
find
out
he
stipulated
to
greater
offense
conduct.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no,
not
after
the
parties
discussed
plea
agreements
and
rejected
them.
i
mean,
there's
a...
it's
a
clear
statement
in
the
record
even
from
the
government:
we
do
not
have
a
plea
agreement,
and
we're
going
to
wait
and
see
what
sentence
you
give.
and
if
we
like
it,
fine.
if
we
don't
like
it,
we
may
reevaluate
this
case
and
take
the
attempted
murder
charge
to
trial
or
whatever.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
the
only
agreement
was
that
the
government
would
do
what
it
wants
to
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
if
would
be
very
different.
i
think
if
there
had
been
that
plea
agreement
with
the
stipulation
to
the
greater
offense
conduct--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--mr.
braxton
could
not
have--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--then,
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--then
either
that
would
be
a
violation
of
a
plea
agreement
or
that...
there
would
be
no
plea
agreement.
that's
why
we
did
what
we
did.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
because
if
the...
the
plea
agreement...
assuming
the
plea
agreement
had
proceeded...
excuse
me...
assuming
the
plea
agreement
represented
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
there
would
have
been
a
stipulation
to
conduct
that
established
the
greater
offense
of
attempted
murder
that
would
have
been
required
in
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
in
return
for
the
defendant's
agreement
that
he
committed
an
attempted
murder.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
without
that
quid
pro
quo,
the
plea
agreement
would
have
broken
down.
if
we
had...
if
we
had
signed
such
an
agreement,
and
then
in
open
court
said,
by
the
way,
we
don't
agree
we
committed
attempted
murder.
the
government
certainly
could
have
said,
well,
then
there's
no
plea
agreement.
it's
broken;
we
withdraw.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
and
we
would
be
where
we
are.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
not
in
this
case.
only
unless
the
defendant
would
have
agreed
to
the
higher-base
offense
level.
what
defendants
says
is...
the
defendant's
action
in
effect
say,
i
will
not
agree
to
acknowledge
an
attempted
murder.
i
will
agree
to
acknowledge
use
of
the
hand
gun
and
the
assault
on
the
federal
officers.
we
are
left
with
two
choices.
go
to
trial
or
the
choice
given
us
by
the
guidelines...
proceed
to
be
sentenced
for
aggravated
assault
and
try
to
minimize
any
damage
from
the
lurking
attempted
murder
charge.
that
was
taken
away
from
the
case
by
the
trial
court,
using
the
base
offense
level
for
the
higher
offense.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
no,
i
would
not
be
making
this
argument.
if...
if
the
trial
court
had
established
the
base
offense
level
for
the
aggravated
assault
and
then
said,
i
now
think
i'm
going
to
depart
upward.
and
here
is
why
i
am
going
to
do
what
i'm
going
to
do.
and
take
an
argument
on
the
extent
of
the
departure
and
the
nature
of
the
departure.
then
we
would
not
be
saying,
well,
there's
no
stipulation,
you
can't
depart,
because
the
judge
could
use
what
he
believed
the
actual
conduct
of
the
case
was
as
a
ground
for
departure.
but
significantly,
the
appellate
review
is
very
different.
the
appellate
review
of
establishing
the
base
offense
level
is
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
the
appellate
review
of
a
departure
is
much
more
stringent.
was
there
a
ground
for
a
departure?
do
the
facts
support
the
departure
and
was
the
extent
of
the
departure
reasonable?
that's
what
we
envisioned
would
happen
from
the
beginning
of
this
case,
that
we
would
have
a
base
offense
level
for
aggravated
assault
and
we
would
engage
in
a
departure
analysis
where
the
defense
would
try
to
constrain
and
restrict
the
upward
departure
and
then
argue
in
favor
of
a
downward
one.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
exactly,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
said.
i
think
that's--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
if
it's
a
question
of
fact,
i
have
to
agree
with
it,
because
the
fourth
circuit's
standard
is
that
questions
of...
determinations
of
fact
will
be
given
great
deference
and
will
be
overturned
only
if
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
that's
what
should
be
involved
because
choosing
the
baseline
is
very
simple.
you
look
it
up.
according
to
1b1.1
and
1b1.2,
you
take
the
offensive
conviction
and
you
look
it
up.
and
if
there's
more
than
one
given,
you
use
1b1.3
to
choose
between
them.
there
was
only
one
given
here,
and
it
wasn't
looked
up.
rather,
what
the
trial
court
said
was,
you
have
not
stipulated
to
any
greater
offense.
nevertheless,
because
i
think
you
attempted
a
murder,
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
base
offense
level
for
the
higher
offense.
that
puts
the
defense
in
the
position
of
having
to
create
a
downward
departure
from
a
base
[inaudible]
that
shouldn't
be
done.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
what
the
fourth
circuit
determined
was
that
since
the
base
offense
level
set
in
this
case
was
based
upon
a
stipulation,
it's
really
just
a
finding
of
fact.
but
the
fourth
circuit
had
to
find
a
stipulation
in
the
face
of
the
defendant's
denial
of
the
crime
to
which
he
was
now
being
found
does
stipulate.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
the
appellate
review
of
departures
is
a
significant
difference
from
appellate
review
of
base
offense
levels.
i
think
that
the
standard
of
proof
for
a
departure,
while
much
less,
triggers
the
more
extensive
appellate
review.
for
a
base
offense
level
to
be
set
on
stipulated
conduct,
there's
really
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
occurred,
because
the
defendant
is
saying
i
committed
this
greater
conduct.
and
i
agreed
to
do
it,
and
i
agree
to
the
effect
of
doing
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
well,
i
think
that's...
that's
a
great
help
in
this
case
for
the
defense.
and
i
think
that
it's
a
strong
point
for
the
defense,
because
there
is
no
concession
to
intent
to
murder.
and
the
legislative
history
of
11.14
indicates
you
need
that.
but
the
argument
would
be
the
same
even
if
that
were
not
the
case.
i
would
make
the
same
argument
if
the
defendant
acknowledged
all
of
the
essential
elements
of
the
offense
but
still
said,
i
refuse
to
stipulate.
what
that
tells
the
trial
court
is,
if
you
want
to
sentence
me
from
my
actual
conduct,
you're
going
to
have
to
depart
to
do
it.
and
it
might
be
very
easy
to
do
that
departure.
i
am
not,
however,
going
to
agree
to
a
base
offense
level
for
the
greater
offense.
now,
it
may
seem
like
a
small
point,
but
the
second
circuit
certainly
recognized
in
the
mccall
case
that
being
sentenced
under
the
wrong
base
offense
level
is
the
denial
of
a
fundamental
right
under
the
guidelines.
guideline
sentencing
hinges
on
the
establishment
of
a
base
offense
level
and
triggers
procedures
to
move
away
from
it.
the
base
offense
level
is
the
safe
place.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
absolutely.
we
could
have...
we
could
have
gone
to
trial
for
attempted
murder.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
the
government
got
the
attempted
murder
sentence.
why
would
it
go
to
trial
for
attempted
murder?
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
but
it
should
not
have.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
it
did.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
after
sentencing.
after
sentencing
and
after
it
had
determined
it
got
the
sentence...
in
fact
it
got
a
sentence
through
much
higher
than
the
sentence
it
was
looking
for.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
anticipated
that
was
a
possible
outcome,
because
the
only
other
alternative
was
to
go
to
trial
on
everything.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
worth
the
tactics
of
the
case
to
say,
if
we
can
plead
guilty
to
the
two
charges
we
would
even
acknowledge
at
trial,
and
try
to
limit
the
sentence,
based
upon
the
offense
level
for
the
aggravated
assault,
if
we
can
reach
a
point
that's
acceptable
to
the
defense
and
the
government
decides
not
to
go
forward
on
the
attempted
murder,
we
may
have
saved
mr.
braxton
a
certain
number
of
years
in
jail.
and
it
was
worth
that
attempt.
and
the
guidelines
gave
us
the
right
to
do
that,
and
it
gave
us
the
procedure
to
do
it.
and
the
trial
court
acknowledged
that
you
didn't
stipulate
to
the
greater
offense.
you
should
not
have
the
base
offense
level
set
for
that
according
to
the
guidelines.
nevertheless,
that's
what
happened.
we
were
not
dealing
with
a
departure
case.
i
would
i
think
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
if
there
are
other
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
certainly
answer
them.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
we
would
have
said
we're
not
doing
that.
we
refuse
to
make
a
stipulation
to
these
facts
formally,
because
we
are
not
stipulating
to
them.
and
if
the
trial
court
then
said,
i
refuse
to
take
a
plea
without
a
formal
stipulation
of
facts,
we
would
have
said,
fine.
let's
go
to
trial.
but
that
seems
to
me
less
judicially
economical
than
taking--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--we
would
not
have
signed
that,
because
we
could
not
stipulate
to
the
facts
of
attempted
murder
because
mr.
braxton
denied
he
committed
an
attempted
murder.
if
we
would
have
done
that,
we
would
have
entered
the
plea
agreement.
but
we
rejected
all
of
that.
in
summation
at
this
point,
i
would
simply
say
that
the
guidelines
must
be
interpreted
strictly.
they
mean
what
they
say.
a
stipulation
is
a
formal
agreement
between
the
parties.
if
you
can
extract
that...
that
agreement
during
plea
negotiation,
you
can
get
a
higher
base
offense
level
set
for
a
crime
of
conviction.
without
that
stipulation,
you
must...
you
must...
you
must
use
the
departure
procedure,
which
is
a
different
procedure,
which
has
different
benefits
and
pitfalls
for
the
defense.
but
that
that's
a
choice
the
parties
can
make,
and
the
right
to
pick
one
of
those
procedures
is,
as
you
can
see
in
this
case,
uniquely
within
the
control
of
the
defendant.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
i
think
it
is
the
government
who
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways,
and
i
think
that's
clear
from
this
case.
unable
to
extract
a
stipulation
to
greater
offense
conduct,
the
government
essentially
says,
well,
we
don't
have
to,
we
can
get
it
anyway.
because
once
you
acknowledge
a
factual
proffer,
not
that
compels
a
finding
of
attempted
murder,
but
in
the
words
of
the
fourth
circuit,
that
could
support
a
finding
of
attempted
murder--
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
--well,
i
think
that's
preserved
from
the
beginning.
i...
reading
on
page
22
before
where
mr.
marzen
started,
"on
behalf
of
mr.
braxton,
i
state
he
is
not
admitting
he
attempted
to
specifically
murder
anyone.
"
how
you
can
say
that
and
then
in
the
same
breath
say,
but
i'm
going
to
stipulate
to
attempted
murder
is
not
something
that's
fair.
xxx
preserved
on
appeal.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
yes,
your
honor,
because...
if
i
may
answer
the
question.
the
trial
court
never
engaged
in
any
stipulation
inquiry
like
the
fifth
circuit
in
morton
to
determine
the
factual
basis
for
the
elements
of
the
stipulation.
because
you
must
remember
the
trial
court
found
there
was
no
stipulation.
on
page
77,
the
court's
crystal
clear.
there
is
no
stipulation.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
he
might
stipulate
he
committed
an
offense
if
he
were
sure
he
were
not
going
to
have
a
sentencing
damage
for
it
for
purposes
of
acknowledging
full
criminal
conduct.
i
mean,
there's
no
argument
here
that
mr.
braxton
could
not
be
sentenced
for
what
he
did.
the
argument
is
he
a
right
to
have
the
sentence
calculation
start
at
the
lower
level.
mr.
stephen
j.
cribari
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
