justice
white
but
none
were
fired
before
the
door
was
kicked
open?
justice
white
--why
not
treat
the
commission
in
such
a
situation
like
we
had...
treat
congress?
congress
can
always
overrule
some
statutory
interpretation.
justice
white
he
goes
to
jail.
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
well,
of
course
there's...
what's
the
time
table
for
the
commission
to
act?
justice
white
it's
possible
we
might
wait
for
them.
justice
white
do
you
suggest
we
do?
i
would
think
you
would
at
least,
rather
than
hold
against
you.
[laughter]
justice
white
--i
don't
suppose
if
there...
if
there
had
been
a
plea
agreement
in
this
case,
what...
what
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
about?
you...
that
i
agree
to
plead
guilty
to...
to
assault,
but
i
don't...
i'm
not
pleading
to
a...
to
attempted
murder.
but
i
stipulate
to
these
facts
for
purposes
of...
now,
would
the
case
be
any
different
then?
justice
white
yes--
justice
white
--i
know,
but
what
if
mr.
braxton
said,
i'm
not
pleading
guilty
to
the...
either
in
the
agreement
or
in
open
court,
he
says,
i
didn't
plead
guilty
to
attempted
murder.
and
i
didn't
commit
attempted
murder.
justice
white
i
do
not...
i
do
not
agree
that
i
committed
it.
justice
white
why
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
plea
agreement?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
plea
agreement
probably
would
have
required
the
government
to
dismiss
the
attempted
murder
charge.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
it's
a
red
herring
then.
there
never
would
have
been
a
plea
agreement
that
would
have
been
relevant.
justice
white
well,
if
the...
if
the
court
had
proceeded
to
achieve
this
result
by
another
way,
would
you
be
making
your
same
argument
that...
that
the
stipulate...
or
the
agreement
as
to
these
facts
would
not
justify
the
court
in
enhancing
the
sentence?
justice
white
would
you
say
there
still
would
have
to
be
a
formal
stipulation?
justice
white
but
you're
saying...
choosing
the
baseline
is
a...
would
be
affirmed
unless
it
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
white
well,
do
you
agree
with
that?
it
sounds
like
a
questionable
call
to
me.
justice
white
yeah,
surely.
is
that
what's
involved
in
choosing
another
baseline?
justice
white
xxx
view
of
that,
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
question
of
fact.
it
doesn't
sound
like--
justice
white
--okay,
go
ahead.
justice
white
well,
the...
did
the
government...
i
suppose
the
government
could
have
tried
you
for
attempted
murder...
tried
your
client?
justice
white
yes.
you
say
if
you
want
to
sentence
me
for...
find
me
guilty
of
attempted
murder
and
sentence
me
for
that,
let's...
try
me.
justice
white
but
the
government
dismissed
it?
justice
white
yes,
well--
justice
white
--but
anyway
it
dismissed
it.
justice
white
when?
justice
white
so
did
you
anticipate
that...
that
you
were
going...
that
you'd
plead
guilty
to
assault
and
then
were
going
to
stand
trial
for
attempted
murder?
justice
white
you
don't
think
it
would
be
enough
then
in
this
case
i...
if
the...
if
the
judge
said,
i
would
like
your
stipulation
of
these
facts
to
be
made
formally?
justice
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
you...
that
you
said,
okay,
judge,
i'm...
put
it
in
writing
and
i'll
sign
it.
and
so
they
write
out
the
facts
and
the
last...
i
hereby
stipulate
to
these
facts.
you
would
not
have
signed
that?
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't...
nothing
like...
he
never
agreed
that
he
intended
to
kill.
you
just
have
to
infer
it
from
the
other
facts.
justice
white
you
say
you
don't
aim
at
somebody
without
intending
to
kill
them.
well,
but
you
have
to...
you
have
to...
he
didn't
agree
though
with
that
inference.
justice
white
well,
would
the...
as
i
understand
your
opponent,
it
wouldn't
have...
unless
it
was
the
plea...
formal
plea
agreement,
it
wouldn't
have
done
him
any
good...
it
wouldn't
have
done
the
government
any
good
even
if
he...
you
had
included
in
your
statement
of
facts
that
he
intended
to
kill
and
he
agreed
to
that.
it
would
still
say
it
has
to
be
a
formal
plea
agreement?
justice
white
which
one--
--well,
let
him
finish
the
answer.
all
right,
go
ahead.
go
ahead.
justice
white
well,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
fire
through
an
open
doorway
and
still
have
the
marshal
standing
behind
the
door?
and
where
did
these
shots
hit?
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
this
door
was
flung
open
and
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner
as
to
where
the
bullets
hit
the
door?
justice
white
well,
then...
and
then
they
weren't
fired
through
an
open
doorway?
justice
white
they
hit
the
door
after
it
was
open.
justice
white
well,
if
the
door...
if
the
shots
hit
the
door
where
he
said
it
did,
the
door...
the
door
certainly
opened
awfully
fast
if
the
bullets
hit
where
he
says
they
hit.
justice
white
they
hit
on
the
side
of
the
door
that
before
it
was
opened
the
officers
were
standing
behind.
justice
white
after
it
was...
after
it
was
open
and
it
was
on
the
outside
of
the
door?
justice
white
well,
the
second
one
must
have.
the
first
i
could
understand.
but
how
could
the
first
one
hit
the
outside
and
the
second
one
hit
the
inside?
justice
white
ah,
yes.
justice
white
well,
in
that
event,
certainly
the...
the
bullet
wasn't
fired
through
an
open
doorway.
[laughter]
justice
white
and
furthermore,
i
can
prove
it,
because
now
the
sentencing
commission
has
interpreted
it's
own
rule.
justice
white
well,
suppose
the...
suppose
the...
suppose
the
sentencing
commission
hadn't
done
anything
at
all.
can
you...
can
you...
can
you
use
a
2255
to
challenge
an
alleged
misinterpretation
of
the
guideline?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
court
could
have
said,
well,
with
these
facts...
you've
plead...
you've
now
plead
guilty
to
attempted
murder.
i
hereby
find
you
guilty
of
attempted
murder.
