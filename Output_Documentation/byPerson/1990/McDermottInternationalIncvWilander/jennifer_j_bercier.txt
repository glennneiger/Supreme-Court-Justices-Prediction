ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
stated
only
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
admiralty
case
of
miles
v.
apex
marine,
we
do
not
sail
today
in
unchartered
waters.
since
the
passage
of
the
merchant
marine
act
in
1915,
congress
has
provided
us
with
six
indicia
of
their
approval
of
the
mission
seaman's
test
for
status
used
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
admiralty
courts
in
this
nation.
as
the
court
noted
in
miles...
sir?
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
there
are
11
circuits
i
count
that--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--there
are
11
circuits
that
i
count,
everybody
except
the
seventh
and
the
fourth--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--along
with
the
fifth
circuit.
i
did
find
admiralty
decisions
in
all
of
them.
some
of
them
don't
have
very
many,
your
honor.
as
the
court
noted
in
miles,
such
policy
decisions
by
congress
are
to
be
given
their
appropriate
weight
in
decisional
law,
since
it
is
by
this
means
that
congress
indicates
the
sphere
within
which
its
policy
is
to
have
effect.
as
petitioner
noted,
the
term
seaman
was
not
defined
in
the
merchant
marine
act,
so
our
first
indicia
of
the
correct
instruction
to
be
given
to
this
term
must
come
from
an
examination
of
the
meaning
given
to
it
by
courts
of
that
era.
we
would
refer
the
court
to
some
of
the
most
important
decisions
of
the
era
discussed
more
fully
in
our
brief
in
that
of
amicus
american
trial
lawyers,
including
the
ocean
spray,
saylor
v.
taylor,
which
is
the
seal
clubber
case,
the
j.s.
warden,
involving
a
bartender,
written
by
judge
leonard
hand,
the
minna
and
the
murphy
tugs
written
by
judge
brown,
who
later
as
justice
brown
would
sit
on
this
court
and
author
the
osceola
and
the
buena
ventura,
cited
by
this
court
in
the
first
three
cases
to
discuss
seaman
status,
warner
v.
goltra,
norton
v.
warner,
and
south
chicago
coal
company
v.
bassett.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am,
he
did
live
aboard
the
db-9
and
this
goes
back
to
your
question
earlier
about
a
fleet
of
vessels.
he
lived
and
planned
his
activities
aboard
the
db-9.
he
would
then
be--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
i
disagree--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--that
is
how
petitioner
has
characterized
that.
i
don't
agree
with
that
conflict
of
laws
interpretation.
the
db-9
was
owned
by
a
company
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
new
orleans,
louisiana.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
they
found
him
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
db-9
and
the
gates
tide.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
your
honor,
certiorari
was
not
granted.
in
fact,
that
was...
certiorari
was
applied
for
on
that
issue
and
not
granted.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
i
feel
that--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--well,
of
course,
i
think
you
can
still
affirm
that
this
circuit
in
this
case...
i
think
what
this
case
is
about
is
are
we
going
to
choose
between
the
fifth
circuit
rule
and
the
seventh
circuit
rule.
i
think
that's
really
the
issue
before
the
court.
and
the
court
referred...
justice
o'connor
referred
to
the
norton
case...
norton
says
specifically
that
navigation,
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
aid
to
navigation
test,
is
not
limited
to
putting
over
the
helm
but
includes
duties
essential
for
other
purposes
of
the
vessel.
the
plaintiff
in
norton
was
on
the
vessel
that
never
went
out
to
sea.
so
was
the
plaintiff
in
senko.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
okay.
permanent
attachment
is
the--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--he
was
assigned
to
the
gates
tide
for
this
particular
hitch,
and
this
has
been
a
rule
which
has
developed
in
the
fifth
circuit
due
to
the
fleet
of
vessels
concept
where
employees
are
required
to
work
on
different
vessels.
and
we
have
found
that
he
has
that
degree
of
permanent
attachment
if
he
is
performing
for
that
period
of
this
work,
a
substantial
portion
of
his
work
aboard
the
gates
tide.
that--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--that
wasn't
part
of
the
issues
before
the
court
when
we
decided
the--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--i'm
trying
to
remember,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
as
to
the
permanent
attachment
question?
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
the
fleet
of
vessels
concept
at
all.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
gates
tide.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
oh,
sir?
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
i
am.
i'm
asking
the
court
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
finding
that
he
was
a
crew
member
of
the
gates
tide.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
your
honor,
that
question
was
brought
up
as
to
the
degree
of
his
permanency
of
attachment.
but
i
feel
that
we
need
to
affirm
in
this
case
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
seaman
as
to
the
gates
tide.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
sure.
the
lady
who
takes
the
staten
island
ferry
to
work
does
not
contribute
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel.
very
simply.
if
there's
an
analogy
to
be
drawn
in...
or
to
the
staten
island
ferry,
it's
to
the
man
aboard
the
staten
island
ferry
who
directs
the
cars
where
to
park.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
but
she
would
not
be
contributing
to
that
mission
and
the
mission
of
the
vessel--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
broad
interpretation
of
seaman's
status
and
i
won't
argue
with
you
if
you
want
to
hold
that
but
that
would
make
her--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--i'll
make
her
a
seaman,
too,
if
you
want
to.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
i'm
sorry.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
well,
justice
scalia
would
afford
her
that
status.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
i
would
require
her
to
contribute
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel.
i'm
not
quite
sure
about
the
hypothet
if
she
is
performing...
if
the
vessel
has
any
connection
other
than
transportation
to
and
from
her
employment.
if
she
is
actually--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--uh-huh.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
she
would
be
a
seaman.
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
employees
that
are
transferred
to
and
from
work
sites
where
the
boat
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
their
duties
are
not
seamen.
the
important
distinction
in
this
case
is
that
all
the
air
compressors
and
hoses
were
kept
aboard
the
gates
tide
at
all
times
and
they
remained
upon
the
gates
tide
and
the
crew
pulled
the
hoses
up
on
the
platform
to
perform
the
work,
so
the
vessel
itself
was
essential
to
performing
the
painting
functions.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
sir.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
sir,
he
was.
that's
absolutely
correct.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
mr.
wilander,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
mr.
wilander
and
at
least
one
other
employee
would
stay
on
the
vessel
to
operate
the
machinery,
the
air
compressor
and
the
hoses.
there
would
be
other
members
of
the
crew
up
on
the
platform
doing
the
painting
and
he
would
also
conduct
his
supervision
from
the
vessel
itself.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
it's
designated
as
the
paint
boat
for
that
purpose.
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of...
raised
by
the
court
as
to
what
is
maritime
commerce.
maritime
commerce
is
business
performed
from
a
vessel.
i
don't
think
that
herb's
welding
can
be
made
to
stand
for
the
proposition
as
petitioner
argues
that
oil
field
and
related
activities
are
not
maritime
commerce.
they
are
maritime
commerce
when
they're
performed
from
a
vessel
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
adoption
of
the
seventh
circuit
test
for
status
would
create
a
huge
gap
in
coverage
for
thousands
of
offshore
workers
who
are
required
to
face
the
perils
of
the
sea
as
incident
to
their
employment.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
by
its
own
terms
does
not
apply
to
those
aboard
vessels
and
as
explained
earlier,
the
statutory
definition
of
the
term
vessel
at
1
u.s.c.
3
includes
all
water
craft
used
in
transportation
or
capable
of
being
used
in
transportation;
therefore
it
would
include
all
of
the
floatable
special-purpose
craft
engaged
in
offshore
mineral
production.
if
a
worker
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
aboard
one
of
these
structures
is
not
a
seaman,
he
will
be
left
with
no
remedy,
because
the
lands
act
will
not
provide
him
with
compensation
nor
can
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
be
applied
extraterritorially.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
if
they
are...
if
they're
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
they
are
covered--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--oh,
in
the
persian
gulf.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
does
not
cover
him.
louisiana
state
workman's
compensation
law
does
not
cover
him.
i
don't
know
what
the
law
of
qatar
would
do.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
i
would
feel
sure
nothing.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
nothing,
your
honor.
that
is
the
argument
of
petitioner.
as
judge
robison
noted
in...
as
judge
wisdom
noted
in
the
robison
opinion,
the
aid
to
navigation
requirement
has
been
watered
down
so
much
that
it's
really
lost
its
meaning.
i
think
that
the
mission
concept
is
much
more
useful
and
encompasses
the
changing
needs
of
the
maritime
industry.
we
would
also
refer
the
court
to
the
oceanographic
research
vessels
act.
vessels
engaged
in
oceanography,
like
the
paint
boat
gates
tide,
carry
two
crews;
one
a
navigational
crew
and
another
crew
of
scientific
personnel.
by
means
of
the
statute,
congress
excluded
these
scientists
from
seaman
status
under
the
jones
act
if
the
ship
owner
obtained
certification
from
the
coast
guard
if
the
vessel
is
engaged
in
oceanography.
now,
obviously
this
statute
would
never
have
been
necessary
except
that
congress
recognized
these
scientists
would
normally
be
classified
as
seamen.
i
feel
that
the
fourth
and
clearest
indicia
of
congressional
intent
came
in
1970
and
1971
when
senator
john
tower
of
texas
introduced
legislation
to
extend
the
benefits
of
the
longshoreman
act
to
workers
employed
offshore
in
marine
extractive
operations,
which
the
bill
defined
as
basically
anything
to
do
with
mineral
production
over
navigable
waters.
the
bill
would
have
made
such
compensation
the
sole
and
exclusive
remedy;
no
more
jones
act,
no
more
general
maritime
law,
no
more
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
it
would
have
amended
the
longshoremans
act
to
remove
the
exclusion
from
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
unless
that
person
was
engaged
solely
under
the
manning
requirements
set
forth
by
the
united
states
coast
guard.
so
this
bill
would
have
in
effect
have
codified
the
application
of
the
seventh
circuit
rule
in
areas
where
mineral
production
takes
place
over
navigable
waters.
presented
with
the
opportunity
to
make
this
change
in
the
law,
congress
rejected
this
bill
twice.
in
1982,
congress
amended
the
jones
act
to
preclude--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--no,
they
just
voted
down
the
bill,
your
honor.
the
bill
was
not
passed.
congress
amended
the
jones
act
in
1982,
though,
to
preclude
coverage
for
alien
workers
engaged
in
oil
and
gas
operations
off
the
coast
of
foreign
countries.
vaz
borralho
v.
keydril,
cited
in
the
brief
of
amicus
american
trial
lawyers,
discusses
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
and
concludes
that
its
purpose
was
to
clarify
and
codify
existing
conflict
of
laws
rules.
the
opinion
quotes
the
statement
of
senator
long
of
louisiana:
"such
a
clarification
would
not
affect
u.s.
workers
no
matter
where
in
the
world
they
were
or
seamen
on
bluewater
vessels
or
anyone
on
the
u.s.
continental
shelf.
"
our
brief
also
cites
the
statement
of
senator
john
breaux.
the
amendment
"does
maintain
the
full
range
of
u.s.
jones
act
protection
american
courts
currently
give
to
american
citizens
employed
on
both
traditional
merchant
marine
vessels
and
special-purpose
vessels
engaged
in
exploration
and
development
of
mineral
resources
no
matter
where
they
are
located.
"
as
the
foregoing
clearly
indicates,
your
honors,
congress
knows
how
to
amend
the
jones
act.
congress
knows
that
special-purpose
vessels
engaged
in
offshore
oil
production
fit
the
statutory
definition
of
a
vessel.
congress
knows
workers
aboard
these
structures
are
covered
under
the
jones
act.
congress
has
rejected
the
opportunity
to
change
this
status.
congress
has
made
its
own
policy
decision,
and
this
being
the
case,
this
court
must
give
effect
to
the
will
of
congress.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
ma'am,
they
certainly
don't,
and
that
has
been
the
holding
starting
with
bassett--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--i
think
that
what
the
court
is
required
to
answer
in
this
case...
what
i
understood
we
were
here
for
today...
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
worker
must
contribute
to
the
transportation
function
of
a
vessel
in
order
to
be
a
seaman,
as
he
is
required
to
do
now
in
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
would
not
make
a
bartender
or
a--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--i
think
we're
reviewing
the
test
used
by
the
fifth
circuit--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--the
fifth
circuit...
the
jury
did
have
the
test
used
by
the
fifth
circuit.
that
was
also
the
basis
of
the
jury
charge.
they
were
charged
that
if
you
find
that
he
contributed
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel,
he
is
a
seaman.
so
i
think
we're
trying
to
find
out
today
if
in
fact
that
is
the
law.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
sir,
and
in
fact
that's
what
this
court
addressed
in
norton
v.
the
warner
company,
wherein
the
court
stated
that
although
we
held
in
south
chicago
v.
bassett
that
seaman
status
is
almost
always
for
the
tryer
fact.
in
this
case
we
must
hold
this
seaman...
this
is
a
seaman
as
a
matter
of
law.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
sir.
so
i
think
our
question
is
what...
were
they
in
this
case.
and
i
contend
that
they
were.
i
think
that
petitioner
misreads
the
holding
of
this
court
in
herb's
welding
v.
gray.
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
workers
engaged
in
offshore
drilling
on
a
floating
or
floatable
structure
were
not
seamen
and/or
were
not
engaged
in
maritime
commerce.
in
fact,
this
court
specifically
distinguished
between
workers
aboard
fixed
platforms
and
those
aboard
floatable
structures
and
recognized
the
vessel
status
of
the
latter.
herb's
welding
stands
for
the
proposition
that
oil
drilling
is
not
traditional
maritime
activity
when
it
is
done
on
land,
since
by
prior
decision
of
this
court,
the
court
was
required
to
treat
the
fixed
platform
as
equivalent
to
an
artificial
island.
but
in
this
case,
the
oil
drilling
and
the
services
related...
they,
too,
were
done
from
a
vessel.
the
restrictive
interpretation
of
maritime
activity
espoused
by
the
petitioner
was
repudiated
by
this
court
very
recently
in
the
case
of
sisson
v.
ruby,
which
declined
to
hold
that
only
navigation
can
be
characterized
as
substantially
related
to
traditional
maritime
activity.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
sir.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
not
contending
that.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
your
honor,
rodrey
v.
etna.
the
court
held
that
that
was
a...
considered
the
equivalent
of
an
artificial
island.
petitioner
also
urges
this
court
to
define
the
term
seaman
by
reference
to
the
federal
employees
liability
act.
this
approach
is
not
new
and
was
specifically
rejected
by
this
court
in
1952
in
the
case
of
desper
v.
starved
rock
ferry
company,
wherein
the
court
stated,
"seamen
were
given
the
rights
of
railway
employees
under
the
jones
act,
but
the
definition
of
seaman
was
never
made
dependent
on
the
meaning
of
employee
as
used
in
legislation
applicable
to
railroads.
"
our
brief
and
that
of
the
amicus
discusses
at
great
length
prior
decisions
of
this
court
pertaining
to
seaman
status
including
warner,
bassett,
norton,
swansen,
senko,
gianfala,
grimes,
butler,
and
tipton.
rather
than
belabor
the
facts
and
holdings
of
each
of
these
cases,
we
would
simply
point
out
that
in
gianfala,
grimes,
senko,
tipton,
and
butler,
all
of
these
workers
would
clearly
have
failed
the
seventh
circuit
test
for
seaman
status
as
a
matter
of
law.
none
would
have
made
it
to
the
jury.
and
this
court
held
in
each
of
those
cases
that
the
facts
presented
a
question
for
the
tryer
fact
to
decide
as
to
seaman
status.
i
feel
that
to...
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit
this
court
would
be
required
to
overrule
gianfala,
grimes,
senko,
tipton,
and
butler.
the
decision--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--the
seventh
circuit
is
the
only
alternative
if
you...
if
you
want
to
make
a
bartender
and
a
dance
instructor
seamen,
then
you
have
to
make
a
painter
a
seaman,
too,
your
honor,
because
the
only
rationale
for
making
the
bartender
and
the
dance
instructor
seamen
is
that
they
contribute
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel.
so
that
would
equally
apply
to
mr.
wilander
in
this
case.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
no,
sir.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
i
surely
don't.
it
states
specifically
in
their
test
that
they
must
contribute
to
the
transportation
function
of
the
vessel.
i
feel
that
the
seventh
circuit
rule
is
impossible
to
reconcile
with
the
norton
case
wherein
justice
douglas
noted
navigation
is
not
limited
to
putting
over
the
helm.
the
fact
that
norton's
duties
were
different
from
that
of
the...
a
more
traditional
mariner
or
seaman
did
not
prevent
this
court
from
holding
he
was
a
seaman
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
court
explained
as
per
justice
douglas
that
the
fact
that
his
duties
were
different
was
because
he
was
aboard
a
vessel
with
a
different
type
of
mission
or
different
type
of
duties.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
yes,
your
honor,
but
he
gave
the
term
navigation
such
a
broad
meaning,
because
it
said
it's
not
limited
to
steering--
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
--it's
limited
to
all
the
other
purposes
of
the
vessel.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
left
off
i
believe
i
was
answering
a
question
of
yours,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
i
believe
that
question
was
how
do
i
define
aid
in
navigation?
i
define
aid
in
navigation
as
being
the
equal
to
aiding
in
the
mission
of
the
vessel,
because
this
court
held
in
norton
v.
warner
that
navigation
includes
all
of
the
purposes
for
which
the
vessel
sails.
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
dissent
in
senko
is
of
no
help
to
him.
in
senko
the
plaintiff
was
never
aboard
the
vessel
while
it
is
in
motion.
in
gianfala
v.
texas
company,
there
was
a
specific
finding
of
fact
in
the
lower
court
that
the
worker
had
no
transportation-related
duties,
yet
this
court
held
that
his
question...
his
status
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
done.
the
inquiry
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
does
he
aid
in
navigation,
but
does
he
contribute
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel,
its
operation,
its
welfare,
and
its
maintenance.
and
it's
been
a
workable
rule.
i
would
refer
the
court
before
i
sit
down
to
the
statement
of
justice
cardosa
in
this
court's
case
of
warner
v.
goltra.
justice
cardosa,
holding
that
the
master
of
a
vessel
was
also
included
within
the
coverage
of
the
jones
act,
noted
that
the
term
seaman
must
be
defined
in
light
of
the
mischief
to
be
corrected
and
the
end
to
be
attained.
the
new
measure
of
recovery
under
the
jones
act,
according
to
cardosa,
should
be
the
same
for
everyone
aboard
the
vessel.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
he
has
some
permanent
memory
loss,
your
honor.
he
sustained
a
head
injury,
has
a
steel
plate
in
his
head.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
sir?
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
he's
working
in
sales,
no
longer
going
to
work
offshore
where
the
money
was.
this
court
stated
in
1958
in
kernan
v.
american
dredging
company
that
by
passing
the
jones
act,
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
a
static
remedy,
but
one
which
would
respond
to
meet
the
changing
conditions
and
the
commensurate
responsibility
of
the
maritime
industry
toward
its
vessel-based
workers.
judge
wisdom
noted
in
robison
that
the
absence
of
any
legislative
restrictions
in
the
act
enabled
the
law
to
develop
naturally
along
with
the
development
of
special-purpose
vessels.
the
very
real
need
for
uniformity
in
the
maritime
law,
with
which
we
absolutely
agree,
mandates
a
rule
which
will
be
workable
and
which
will
implement
the
intent
of
congress
in
every
jurisdiction
of
this
nation,
not
just
ones
that
have
only
river
traffic.
the
seventh
circuit
rule
allows
workers
to
step
in
and
out
of
coverage
depending
on
whether
they
are
performing
transportation-related
duties.
it
would
inordinately
complicate
the
typical
ship
owner's
necessary
insurance
arrangements
and
completely
ignore
the
fact
that
all
aboard
the
vessel
are
exposed
to
the
same
maritime
perils.
there
is
now
a
maritime
negligence
cause
of
action.
there
is
now
coverage
under
the
jones
act
for
workers
aboard
these
vessels.
the
only
acceptable
conclusion
is
that
seaman
status
should
be
accorded
to
every
employee,
who
like
john
wilander
contributes
to
the
economic
mission
of
the
vessel.
without
john
wilander
and
his
paint
crew,
the
gates
tide
never
turned
a
prop,
because
it
had
no
mission
at
all.
working
a
shift
of
90
straight
days
on,
all
of
it
over
water,
80
percent
of
the
time
spent
aboard
a
vessel,
john
wilander
was
the
quintessential
seaman
of
the
modern
age.
i'd
be
happy
to
address
any
questions
the
court
might
have
in
my
time
remaining.
ms.
jennifer
j.
bercier
thank
you,
your
honor.
