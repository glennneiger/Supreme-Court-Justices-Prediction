mr.
james
e.
doyle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
you
today
involves
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation;
specifically
who
is
entitled
to
sue
for
damages
under
the
jones
act.
that
section,
which
is
also
known
as
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1920
provides
a
right
of
action
to
a
seaman
who
is
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
the
term
seaman
is
not
defined
further
in
the
body
of
the
statute
and
it
has
been
the
subject
of
much
debate.
this
case
also
provides
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
reestablish
and
reaffirm
a
uniform
national
rule.
the
last
definitive
opinion
reached
by
this
court
was
33
years
ago.
and
since
that
time
there
have
been
two
divergent
tracks
which
have
been
taken
from
that
opinion
even
though
it
was
clear.
one
group
of
circuit
courts
decides
seaman
status
questions
based
on
an
analysis,
at
least
in
part,
of
the
subject
seaman's
relationship
to
the
transportation
function
or
the
navigation
function
of
the
vessel.
the
fifth
circuit
in
particular
among
the
others
does
not
take
this
into
consideration,
at
least
not
in
the
same
way.
this
has
led
to
an
inconsistency
of
results
throughout
the
country
and
needs
to
be
addressed.
this
case
particularly
draws
that
line
for
the
court,
because
in
this
case
there
is
little
question,
and
the
fifth
circuit
so
found,
that
mr.
wilander,
the
seaman,
the
person
claiming
status
under
the
act
had
no
responsibilities
relative
to
the
vessel
to
which
he
claimed
status
which
were
related
to
its
transportation
or
navigational
function.
it
also
presents
a
contrast
for
the
court
because
as
a
matter
of
first
principle
in
this
case,
the
district
judge
was
forced
to
decide
what
was
american
law
because
the
plaintiff's
invocation
of
the
jones
act
required
it
since
he
was
injured
in
a
foreign
environment.
he
was
injured
on
a
platform
in
the
persian
gulf.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
not
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
person
he
was
bringing
suit
against
would
have
been
his
employer
and
except
for
the
jones
act's
variation
from
the
general
common
law
there
would
be
no
action
against
his
employer
for
the
general
maritime
negligence.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
that
the
concept
of
aid
to
navigation
has
always
been
considered
as
a
degree
of
the
permanency
of
the
attachment
between
the
worker
and
the
employer's
vessel.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
the
fifth
circuit
says
it's
not
necessary,
but
the
other
circuit
courts
seem
to
say
that
it
is,
in
its
particular--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--you
have
spoken
to
the
issue
many
times.
the
last
time
definitively
in
senko
v.
la
crosse
dredging
which
reemphasized
the
aid
to
navigation
requirement.
and
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
following
up
with
your
question,
it
must
be
at
all
times
considered
when
reviewing
the
jones
act
that
it
is
an
employment-based
statute.
it's
a
statute
which
depends
on
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
employer
and
the
employee.
in
this
case,
mcdermott
international
would
have
been
perfectly
justified
in
believing
that
an
employee
such
as
mr.
wilander,
who
is
a
painter
foreman
operating
on
platforms
in
the
persian
gulf,
would
be
more
exposed
to
those
types
of
hazards
and
risks
associated
with
platform
work
than
he
would
have
been
with
the
perils
of
the
sea.
and
i
should
make
one
further
point
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
mr.
wilander
did
not
live
aboard
the
vessel
to
which
he
claims
attachment
for
purpose
of
his
jones
act
claim.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
he
did.
and
he
participated
with
respect
to
the
gates
tide,
the
american
vessel,
by
using
it
as
a
means
of
transport
to
and
from
the
areas
in
which
he
did
his
work.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
i
don't,
because
he's
not
a
member
of
the
crew
of
that
vessel
any
more
than
he
is
of
the
gates
tide,
since
he
did
not
contribute
to
the
transportation
or
navigational
function
of
the
db-9.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly
so.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly
so.
but
this
court's
opinion
in
senko
v.
la
crosse
dredging
is
relevant,
because
the
db-9
when
it
performs
its
work,
you'll
find
from
the
record,
is
frequently
tied
up
to
a
platform.
it's
not
mobile.
it
stays
in
place
and
in
position
and
serves
as
a
floating
hotel.
and
in
this
court's
opinion
in
senko
this
quotation
is
found:
"the
duties
of
a
man
during
a
vessel's
travel
are
relevant
in
determining
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
crew
while
the
vessel
is
anchored.
"
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
the
mess
crew
certainly
is
composed
of
seamen,
your
honor,
because
they
serve
the
vessel,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
its
use
as
a
vessel
as
opposed
to
something
which
has
another
mission.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
repair
people
present
a
special
problem
because,
of
course,
ship
repairs
are
specifically
identified
under
the
l&h
act
and
it
could
be
that
under
some
circumstances
they
would
be
covered
there
and
not
under
the
jones
act,
but
if
they're
brought
along
on
a
sea
voyage,
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
those
repairs
to
the
engines
or
the
appurtenances
of
the
vessel
which
are
required
during
its
voyage,
they
are
aiding
that
vessel
in
its
navigation
every
bit
as
much
as
the
master.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
they,
also,
justice
o'connor,
aid,
aid
in
the
function
of
the
vessel,
for
a
different
reason
though
perhaps.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
they
are
covered
but
perhaps
for
a
different
reason.
the
analysis
that
i've
made
of
those
types
of
activities
in
the
brief
is
one
which
points
out
that
the...
that
the
cruise
ship
engages
in
maritime
commerce
and
part
of
its
business
is
to
transport
passengers
from
one
place
to
another
and
to
keep
them
entertained
during
the
vessel's
journey.
since
they
do,
they
perform
a
necessary
function
of
the
vessel
in
maritime
commerce
which
is
no
different
from
that
performed
by
the
fishermen
who
are
on
the
fishery
ship
or
the
cook
who's
represented
on
the
tug
boat
which
plies
the
waters
around
manhattan
island.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
they
do,
justice
white,
although
they--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
approach--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--no,
sir,
it
doesn't
sound
like
their
opinion,
but
i
approach
it
this
way,
justice
white.
i
think
that
the
opinion
that
was
reached
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
johnson
was
based
upon
a
particularized
circumstance.
a
person
who
was
working
aboard
a
structure
which
under
title
i,
section
3
would
have
been
a
vessel
but
reached
a
point
in
its
life
when
it
was
not
and
that's
when
this
particular
individual
in
johnson
did
his
work,
was
when
the
vessel
was
no
longer
a
jones
act
vessel.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
differ
in
this
way.
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
your
connection
with
a
vessel
as
a
putative
seaman
is
relevant
if
you
are
connected
only
to
those
activities
which
are
conducted
aboard
the
vessel
when
it's
stopped.
there's
not
a
case
that
i've
seen
in
the
fifth
circuit,
which
is
primarily
the
oil
field
area,
which
holds
that
a
function
which
is
being
performed
by
a
person
who
is
a
seaman
on
a
nontraditional
vessel
is
performed
while
the
vessel
is
in
motion
or
truly
within
navigation.
mr.
wilander's
is
a
case
in
point.
the
gates
tide
is
a
vessel.
it's
a
185-foot
crew
boat.
but
mr.
wilander
didn't
have
anything
to
do
aboard
that
vessel
until
it
was
moored
to
the
platform.
likewise
the
crew--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
do,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
do.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
he
is
just
a
passenger
who
is
there
in
an
employment-related
function.
in
that
sense
i
would--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--he's
an
employee,
not
a
master
of
the
gates
tide,
but
an
employee
of
mcdermott
international
which
had
chartered
it.
but
further
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
submit
that
mr.
wilander's
employment-related
connection
with
respect
to
the
gates
tide
is
no
different
in
any
material
degree
from
a
legal
secretary
who
works
in
a
manhattan
law
firm
and
lives
on
staten
island
and
rides
the
ferry
to
work
every
day.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
employer
owned
the
db-9--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--there
were
a
group
of
vessels
there,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
is
a
possibility;
however,
in
this
case
it
presents
special
problems,
because
not
all
of
the
vessels
to
which
he
could
have
been
detached
were
american.
the
db-9,
as
i
told
you,
was
panamanian
and
actually
the
gates
tide
which
was
only
there
for
5
days
during
the
15
months
that
mr.
wilander
was
employed
was
the
only
american
vessel
that
was
on
the
job.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
justice
white,
i'd
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
finish
my
answer
to
your
earlier
question.
the
distinction
here
is
that
the
fisherman
who
is
looking
for
the
whales
is
performing
a
mission
of
the
vessel
which
is
engaged
in
maritime
commerce.
not
so
mr.
wilander,
because
the
mission
that
he's
performing
is
solely
and
strictly
related
to
the
platform.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir,
i
think
not,
but
perhaps--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--the
vessel
would
have
been
in
navigation.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
this,
justice
white.
i
think
that
he
has
to
form
an
attachment
to
the
vessel
which
is
employment-related
in
scope
and
in
content.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
to
restrict...
and
to
restrict
that
as
the
fifth
circuit
does...
not
to
restrict
it,
rather
to
broaden
it
as
the
fifth
circuit
does...
and
to
say
that
we
are
going
to
consider
your
attachment
to
the
special
mission
as
satisfying
all
requirements
of
status
under
the
aid
to
navigation
test
is
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
ever
said.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
in
my
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
had
taken
pains
to
point
out
that
the
jones
act's
outer
limits
is
going
to
be
defined
in
some
way
as
what
maritime
commerce
has
covered
and
engaged
in
by
the
vessel
and
i
suggest
in
my
brief
that
part
of
the
reason
why
the
robison
opinion
to
the
fifth
circuit
has
lost
its
support--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i'm
sorry.
i
believe
that
the
whaling
vessel
is
different
from
a
vessel
which
is
going
from
platform
to
platform
and
after
the
rides
is
not
engaged
in
maritime
commerce,
while
the
whaling
vessel
is
at
all
times
engaged
in
this
type
of
commerce.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir,
he
never
attained
the
status
as
seaman
in
the
first
place.
the
whaling
vessel
did.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
for
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
real
world,
the
person
who
is
the
whale
spotter
on
the
vessel
is
going
to
have
other
duties
and
he
is
going
to
form
that
type
of
permanent
attachment
to
the
vessel
which
is
related
to
navigation.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
seals--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
in
the
case
involving
the
seal
clubbers
which
is
in
the
respondent's
brief--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
believe
that
the
distinction
there
between
their
case
and
mine
is
that
those
people
performed
the
mission...
the
only
mission
that
the
vessel
had
to
do
which
was
in
maritime
commerce.
the
only
way
they
could
perform
it
was
to
engage
in
that
type
of
activity.
therefore--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
as
i've
said,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
aid
to
navigation
requirement
at
its
base
is
an
indicator,
one
of
perhaps
more
than
one,
of
the
connexity
between
the
seaman
and
the
vessel
itself.
the
people
who
are
engaged
in
a
voyage
which
has
several
points
of
terminus,
such
as
the
seal
clubbers,
could
be
more
attached
to
the
vessel
for
another
reason,
not
having
anything
to
do
with
aid
to
navigation.
mr.
wilander's
different
because
he
only
used
this
boat
to
go
back
and
forth
from
his--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
because
i
believe
that
the
vessel
that
was
involved
in
the
case
that
was
hunting
for
seals
was
more...
had
a
more
all-encompassing
voyage.
the
people
actually
formed
a--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
it
is
a
requirement
that
the
seaman,
the
person
seeking
status
under
the
act,
have
a
permanent
attachment
to
the
vessel.
and
i
suggest
that
the
attachment
in
the
seal
clubber
case
is
more
permanent
than
mr.
wilander's,
because
he
only
used
this
vessel
for
limited
purposes;
to
go
back
and
forth
to
the
platforms
on
which
he
did
his
work.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir,
not
on
the
vessel
to
which
he
claims
attachment.
he
lived
on
the
db-9.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
that's
another
problem,
justice
white,
because
the
jury
actually
found
him
connected
permanently
to
two
vessels.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
in
this
case,
it
is
going
to
be
controlled
exclusively
by
what
the
court
would
have
decided
was
relevant
evidence.
the
court
decided
in
this
case
that
it
was
relevant
for
the
jury
to
consider
on
the
permanent
attachment
question,
robison-type
evidence,
and
if
it
had
been
in
the
seventh
circuit,
that
evidence
would
not
have
been
relevant
so
the
jury
wouldn't
have
had
it.
so
it's
not
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
evidence
of
his
attachment
to
the
special
mission
which
he
alleged
was
performed
by
this
vessel,
by
the
paint
boat,
as
opposed
to
transportation
as
a
navigation
function.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
justice
souter,
specially
i
will
refer
to
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
the
senko
case,
because
i
think
it
clarifies
it.
he
said
you
look
to
the
service
of
the
vessel
in
its
use
as
a
vessel.
the
bartender
and
the
cruise
ship
dance
instructor
serve
that
vessel
in
its
use
as
a
vessel.
they
complement
its
only
reason
for
being.
not
so
mr.
wilander
in
his
case,
because
he
does
nothing
with
respect
to
the
navigation
of
the
vessel.
he
only
has
responsibilities
which
occur
off
the
vessel,
which
happen
when
the
vessel
is
tied
up.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
the
object
of
his
work
is
the
only
reason
that
the
vessel
moves--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--actually
the
facts
i
believe
will
show,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
he
supervised
and
he
stationed
himself
on
the
vessel
most
of
the
time
except
when
he
was
inspecting
the
work
on
the
platform.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
because
the
object
of
his
work
is
off
the
vessel.
he
has
to
inspect
the
work
that
his
painting
crew
has
done
and
that
takes
place
on
the
platform.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
would
agree
that
the
degree
of
permanency
that
made
up
his
attachment
to
that
vessel
would
be
different
in
character
than
it
is
here.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
would
not
agree
that
he's
a
seaman,
no,
sir.
i
think
that--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
don't
believe
he
is
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
so
held
in
senko
and
the
other
cases
that--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--because
he
doesn't
contribute,
as
this
court
has
said,
to
the
navigational
function
of
that
vessel.
he
contributes
only
to
his--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
didn't
actually
say
that,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that
they
could
well
in
the
context
of
the
voyage
for
the
reasons
that
i've
stated.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
of
the
court--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
to
sustain
our
position?
no,
sir.
i
think
senko
is
very
consistent
with
what
the
court
had
done
before
because
senko
did
consider
the
navigational
activities
of
the
subject
worker
to
determine
whether
he
was...
whether
he
had
status
or
not.
and
very
pertinent
to
our
discussion
here,
justice
stevens,
they
said
he
would
have
had
a
significant
relationship
to
the
navigation
of
the
vessel
when
it
went
into
navigation.
that's
the
same
thing
that
this
court
had;
a
procurium
opinion,
gianfala
v.
texas
company;
reversed
a
fifth
circuit
opinion.
it
was
assumed
by
the
robison
family
that
they
had
some
impact
on
oil
drilling
activity
being
maritime
commerce,
but
also
that
particular
worker
in
the
gianfala
case
did
the
same
thing.
it
was
a
semisubmersible
rig
and
his
job
included
a
responsibility
that
he
move
it.
so
this
court
has
never
moved
off
the
requirement
that
a
person
aid
in
the
navigation
of
a
vessel
before
he
is
considered
to
be
a
member
of
its
crew.
and
it's
never
adopted
the
broader
test
that
robison
uses
to
determine
the
attachment.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir,
you
haven't,
but
the
argument
in
senko,
i
think,
was
advanced
against
their
obtaining
status
and
it
was
met
by
justice
harlan
in
the
fashion
that
i've
described.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
do.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
mr.
wilander
was
not
in
this
case
left
without
a
remedy
and
i
would
specifically
refer
the
court
to
page
33
of
the
joint
appendix
at
which
the
clause
in
the
contract
dealing
with
his
remedy
is
reproduced.
he
had
at
a
minimum
the
louisiana
worker's
compensation
law
to
apply
to
any
injury
that
would
befall
him
in
the
service
of
his
employer.
i
would
also
address
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
as
to
whether
the
status
determination
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
it
is.
this
has
been
recognized,
not
by
this
court,
but
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
followed
in
many
others.
the
citation
on
the
case
is
crador,
c-r-a-d-o-r,
v.
the
louisiana
department
of
highways,
625
fed.
2nd
12.27.
and
justice
souter,
turning
to
your
comment
respecting
navigation
and
dropping
that
requirement
entirely,
it
points
out
the
problem
which
i
think
results
in
the
robison
test
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
respondent's
argument.
and
that
problem
is
if
you
drop
a
bright
line
requirement,
you're
left
with
no
logical
stopping
point.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
is.
it
very
much
is,
justice
souter.
but
the
distinction
between
the
bartender
and
the
dance
instructor
and
mr.
wilander
is
that
they
indisputably
support
the
vessel
in
its
use
as
a
vessel.
they
sign
on
the
articles
as
seamen.
they
sail
as
members
of
the
crew.
mr.
wilander
didn't
support
this
vessel.
he
was
supported
by
it.
he
used
this
vessel
as
a
tool
to
perform
his
work
and
that
is
the
distinction
which
this
court
needs
to
address.
otherwise,
as
one
commentator
said,
three
men
in
a
tub
would
fit
the
test
for
status
and
a
convincing
argument
could
be
made
to
include
jonah
and
the
whale.
there's
just
no
logical
end
to
it.
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
1982,
four
judges
on
a
panel
of
13
felt
that
an
en
banc
rehearing
should
be
granted
so
that
the
court
could
have
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
a
helicopter
was
a
vessel
and
whether
its
pilot
was
a
member
of
its
crew.
and
quoted
from
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
other
cases
and
holding
that
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts
have
extended
robison
to
strange
sorts
of
things
to
find
them
to
be
vessels
and
the
injured
person
to
be
a
seaman.
and
they
specifically
cited
floating
oil-drilling
platforms,
which
when
they
do
their
work
are
invariably
hard
aground
and
not
capable
of
movement
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
think
the
inquiry
is
inextricably
tied
together.
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
a
185-foot
crew
boat,
true.
but
in
other
cases
that
have
dealt
with
the
same
theoretical
premise,
justice
scalia,
a
crane
barge,
which
is
a
vessel
under
title
i,
section
3,
a
quarterboat
barge,
which
is
a
vessel
under
title
i,
section
3,
have
been
held
not
to
meet
the
test
for
status,
one
case
from
the
fourth
circuit,
one
from
the
fifth.
so
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
traditional
vessel
is
used
for
reasons
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
vessel.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
think
that's
the
result
which
has
now
been
reached.
i
think
that
if
there's
an
argument
that
can
be
made
by
principled
jurists
that
a
helicopter
is
a
vessel,
the
rule
is
too
lax
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
it
needs
to
be
shored
up.
and
the
navigation
requirement
applies
equally
to
the
vessel
as
well
as
the
men
that
are
serving
upon
it.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
that's
right,
because
he
would
be
serving
the
mission
of
the
helicopter.
but
the
court
ruled
that
he--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--and
vice
versa.
but
not
in
the
same
character,
of
course,
as
mr.
wilander
because
the
helicopter
would
then
also
have
a
transportation
function.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir,
not...
it
might
be
a
fine
distinction,
justice
scalia,
but
it
is
not
that
the
boat
was
not
being
used
as
a
vessel.
it's
that
the
function
that
mr.
wilander
served
in
reference
to
the
vessel
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
use
as
a
vessel.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
was
carried
from
platform
to
platform.
yes,
sir,
there
was.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
remained
on
the
vessel
during
the
time
that
the
painting
activity
was
conducted,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
was--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--but
in
that
sense,
justice
white,
the
vessel
performed
no
additional
function
other
than
the
transport
of
the
men
and
the
equipment
from
one
point
to
the
other.
it
served--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--yes,
sir,
and
once
it
arrived
it's
no
different
from
the
crane
barge
which
is
a
vessel
for
some
purposes
but
has
been
specifically
held
not
only
in
the
fourth
circuit
but
the
fifth,
not
to
be
a
vessel
for
jones
act
purposes.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i'm
saying
that
the
distinction
that's
drawn
is
between
the
statutory
definition
of
a
vessel
which
covers
a
multitude
of
appliances
and
the
use
to
which
that
appliance
is
put
once
it
goes
to
work.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
jones
act,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
again,
because
of
their
connection
to
the
vessel.
i
said
earlier
and
i'll
reemphasize,
the
connection
is
not
only
to
be
determined
in
light
of
the
navigational
function.
it
can
be
found
for
other
reasons.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
in
many
cases
that
is
the
decision
made--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--because
he's
not
permanently
attached
to
the
vessel
and
one
indicia
of
the
fact--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
but
during
that
time--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
think,
justice
souter,
that
with
respect
that's
not
consistent
with
the
way
that
the
law
has
been
applied.
what
i've
tried
to
do
in
making
a
distinction
and
saying
that
bartenders
and
cooks
are
covered
and
people
such
as
mr.
wilander
are
not
is
to
rely
on
this
court's
jurisprudence,
which
i
think
clearly
makes
that
distinction
and
i
think
norton
v.
warner
company
and
senko
are
two
of
the
ones
that
illustrate
it
most
broadly,
because
they
were
only
seamen
because
they
would
have
a
navigational
function
with
respect
to
that
vessel
when
it
was
put
in
transit,
mr
wilander
never
had
it.
so
he
never
achieved
status
in
the
first
place
under
that
argument.
and
i
might
point
out
that
there's
nothing
that
is
inherently
different
about
that
type
of
proposition
than
you
find
in
the
maritime
employment
field
generally.
you
can
have
an
offloading
operation
performed
of
a
vessel
on
a
dock
and
have
three
different
types
of
coverage
that
apply
to
the
workers.
the
checkers
are
going
to
be
covered
under
state
compensation.
the
longshoremen
under
the
lhwca
and
the
seamen
under
the
jones
act.
all
exposed
to
the
same
risks.
all
doing
the
same
job.
but
their
duties
are
defined
in
terms
of
their
employment
responsibilities.
mr.
wilander's
employment
responsibility
was
to
paint
the
platforms.
the
jury
obviously
agreed
with
that,
because
they
said
he
was
permanently
attached
to
the
platform
as
well
as
to
the
vessel.
on
the
point
about
the
review,
i
think
that
it
should
be
pointed
out,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
ruled
that
under
the
seventh
circuit
test,
mr.
wilander
would
not
have
submitted
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
on
status
and
under
robison
he
did.
i
think
that
ends
the
inquiry.
and
further
with
respect
to
the
question--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
