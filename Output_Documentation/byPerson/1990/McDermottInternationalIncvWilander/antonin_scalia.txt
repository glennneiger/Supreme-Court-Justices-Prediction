justice

--what
if
it
was
seals
instead
of
whales?
justice
scalia
would
that
have
been
different?
i
mean
if
they
had
gone
out
hunting
seals,
they
had
to
get
off
a
ship
in
order
to
harpoon
the
darn
thing,
then
he
wouldn't
be
a
seaman?
justice
scalia
but
he
would
if
he
goes
for
whales,
is
that
the
difference?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
what's
it
saying
here
if
somebody's
on
a
boat
that
does
nothing
but
carry
people
to
paint?
i
mean
that's
the
boat's
mission.
this
other
boat
carries
people
to
harvest
seals.
justice
scalia
but
seal
harpooners
don't?
justice
scalia
mrs.
bercier,
could
you
tell
me
how
your
theory
excludes
or
does
it
exclude
the
instance
posited
by
mr.
doyle
of
a
secretary
who
takes
the
staten
island
ferry
to
work?
justice
scalia
but
if...
so
it
would
be
different
if
her
employer
provided
a
boat
whose
only
mission
was
to
bring
those
employees
from
staten
island
to
manhattan?
justice
scalia
why
not?
that
would
be
the
sole
mission
of
the
vessel,
just
as
here
the
sole
mission
is
to
bring
painters
to
the
platform.
justice
scalia
yes,
she
would.
she
does
the
work.
just
as
he
does
the
painting,
she
does
the
secretarial
work.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
boat,
to
get
the
employees
to
do
the
work.
justice
scalia
she's
a
seaman,
too.
justice
scalia
all
right.
[laughter]
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
hear
you.
justice
scalia
did
it
pass
a
law
rejecting
the
bill?
justice
scalia
if
the
only
alternative
is
the
seventh
circuit's
approach,
but
as
i
understand
your
opponent,
mrs.
doyle
or
mrs.
bercier,
he
is
not
arguing
for
that,
because
i
think
he
concedes
that
bartenders
and
dance
instructors
are
covered.
so
therefore,
he's
not
really
arguing
for
the
seventh
circuit's
approach.
justice
scalia
would
it
be
more
helpful
to
everybody
on
that
theory
if
we
dropped
the
reference
to
navigation
entirely?
justice
scalia
but
those
instances
go
to
what's
a
vessel,
not
what's
a
seaman.
you
don't
doubt
that
we
have
a
vessel
here?
justice
scalia
if
i
understand
your
point
correctly,
mr.
doyle,
it
is
that
you
don't
go
as
far
as
the
seventh
circuit.
but
you
say
that
to
be
a
seaman
you
have
to
be
furthering
the
purpose
of
the
vessel
as
a
vessel.
justice
scalia
and
your
assertion
here
is
that
this
boat
was
not
being
used
as
a
vessel
when
it
just
tied
alongside
to
do
painting.
