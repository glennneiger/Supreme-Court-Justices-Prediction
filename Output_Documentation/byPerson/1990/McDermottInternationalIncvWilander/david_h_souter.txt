justice
souter
mr.
doyle,
let
me
recap
something
which
will
at
least
explain
why
i'm
not
following
what
you're
saying.
you
started
off
with
a
criterion
that
the
seaman
must
be
somehow
engaged
as
an
aid
to
the
navigational
function
of
the
ship.
then
justice
o'connor
raised
the
question,
what
about
the
bartender
and
the
dance
instructor?
and
you
said,
well,
they
qualify
because
they're
not
steering
or
doing
anything
like
that,
but
it's
the
object
of
the
ship's
passage
through
the
water
to
engage
in
recreational
activities
which
they
are
aiding.
then
we
got
to
the
question
of
the
harpooner
or
the
seal
harpooner
and
the
problem
that
you
had
with
including
the
seal
harpooner
was
that
the
ship
was
not
moving
at
the
time
he
harpooned
and
that
the
harpooning
was
not,
as
i
understand
it,
an
act
in
furtherance
of
the...
of
maritime
commerce
and
i
think
the
trouble,
at
least
that
i'm
having,
is
understanding
what
you
mean
by
maritime
commerce.
in
the
case
of
the
bartender
and
the
dance
instructor,
the
ship
is
at
least
part
of
the
time
moving
around
because
that's
the
way
it
makes
its
money,
by
carrying
people,
and
the
reason
they
want
to
be
carried
in
the
ship
includes
the
fact
that
they
would
like
to
avail
themselves
of
dancing
and
the
drinking
that
goes
on
the
ship.
in
the
case
of...
that
we
have
before
us,
the
boat
in
question
has
got
to
move
through
the
water
or
the
petitioner
here,
the
respondent
here
doesn't
get
to
the
platform,
and
it's
certainly
doing
it
for
a
commercial
purpose
because
that's
why
they're
paying
people
to
move
the
ship
is
to
get
him
there
so
he
can
do
the
painting.
why
is
there
not
a
connection
to
maritime
commerce
in
the
latter
case,
but
there
is
a
connection
to
maritime
commerce
for
the
bartender?
i
think
we're
asking
for
that
definition.
what
is
maritime
commerce
and
how
do
you
defend
the
distinction
that
you're
making?
justice
souter
thank
you.
you
will
acquit
her
that
status
even
though
the
vessel
is
not
paying
her
a
salary
and
no
one
is
paying
her
salary
to
be
on
the
vessel?
justice
souter
well,
i
want
to
know
what
you
would
do.
justice
souter
i
thought
it
was
just
getting
her
from
staten
island
over
to
manhattan.
justice
souter
you'd
make
her
a
seaman
there?
justice
souter
the
seaman
was
actually
being
paid
to
be
on
the
boat--
justice
souter
--to
do
his
work.
justice
souter
but
haven't
you
dropped
the
bright
line
requirement
once
you
start
including
bartenders
and
dance
instructors?
i
think
it
seems
to
me
that
my
question
is
one
about
candor
rather
than
a
change
in
the
rule.
justice
souter
but
aren't
you
still
arguing
that
if
in
effect
we
get
soft
in
defining
who
is
a
seaman,
we're
going
to
be
asked
to
be
soft
in
defining
what
is
a
vessel,
and
they're
really
2
separate
inquiries.
justice
souter
but
what
you're
really
saying
i
think
then
is
that
vessel
has
to
mean
or
has
to
be
defined
in
terms
of
ways
common
to
all
possible
vessels.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
all
right,
so
there's
a
distinction
between
vessel
as
such
and
vessel
with
a
specific
purpose
in
a
given
case.
justice
souter
all
right,
so
if
your
criterion
is
going
to
be
what
is
common
to
all
vessels
as
such,
how
can
you
consistently
concede
that
the
bartenders
and
the
dance
instructors
are
seamen?
justice
souter
no,
but
aren't
you
now
saying
that
once
you've
got
a
vessel,
anyone
who
is
permanently
connected
with
it,
is
a
seaman?
justice
souter
why
not
in
this
case?
justice
souter
he
was
during
the
period
that
he
was
assigned
to
use
it
for
the
painting
duties.
justice
souter
i
mean
the
bartender
is
not
attached
to
it
for
life.
he's
attached
to
it
for
the
voyage
and
this
man
was
attached
to
it
for
the
length
of
this
boat's
voyage
which
was
to
the
platform
while
the
work
went
on.
