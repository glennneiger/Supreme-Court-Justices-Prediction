justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question
for
my
information?
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
general
maritime
negligence
action
which
the
respondent
could
have
brought?
justice
o'connor
now,
may
i
also
ask
you
what
difference
you
think
it
makes
whether
mr.
wilander
aided
in
the
navigation
of
the
vessel?
if
a
person
who
lives
and
works
aboard
ship...
why
isn't
that
person
just
as
much
a
member
of
the
crew,
as
it
were,
as
someone
who
aids
in
navigation?
justice
o'connor
but
not
a
necessary
concept.
justice
o'connor
and
we
haven't
spoken
to
the
issue?
justice
o'connor
would
you
comment
on
the
facts
a
little
bit
to
that
extent?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
he
slept,
ate,
and
planned
his
activities
aboard
the
barge
db-9?
justice
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
db-9?
justice
o'connor
assuming
we
think
that's
an
essential
test--
justice
o'connor
--which
the
fifth
circuit
does
not.
justice
o'connor
how
about
the
dance
instructor
and
the
bartender
on
the
love
boat?
[laughter]
justice
o'connor
are
they
covered?
justice
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
he
was
simply
in
the
position
of
a
passenger
aboard
the
gates
tide?
justice
o'connor
do
you
go
that
far?
justice
o'connor
you
think
he's
just
a
passenger?
justice
o'connor
he's
also
an
employee?
justice
o'connor
did
the
employer
own
all
these
vessels,
the
gates
tide,
and...
or
lease
the
gates
tide
and
the
db-9?
justice
o'connor
is
it
a
group
of
vessels,
in
effect?
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe
we
should
look
at
whether
he's
attached
to
"a
group
of
vessels".
is
that
a
possibility?
justice
o'connor
mr.
doyle,
are
we
here
reviewing
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claim?
is
the
issue
we
have
to
weigh
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
to
let
this
question
go
to
the
jury?
justice
o'connor
it's
whether
the
evidence
was
relevant
at
all.
justice
o'connor
what
evidence?
justice
o'connor
mrs.
bercier--
justice
o'connor
--in
the
norton
case,
the
court
spoke
about
a
seaman
having,
needing
to
have
a
permanent
connection
with
a
vessel.
justice
o'connor
now
how
do
we
find
that
with
the
gates
tide
here?
this
respondent
lived
aboard
the
db-9,
did
he
not?
justice
o'connor
so
under
norton
and
your
argument,
you
would
say
at
least
he's
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
db-9?
justice
o'connor
but
that's
not
the
basis
of
his
claim.
justice
o'connor
he
has
to...
because
it's
registered,
only
the
gates
tide
as
a
u.s.
vessel,
he
has
to
win
or
lose
on
the
basis
of
his
attachment
to
the
gates
tide?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
do
we
have
to
take
this
case?
i
thought
the
jury
found
separately
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
three
different
vessels.
justice
o'connor
all
right,
two.
justice
o'connor
and
if
we
think
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
gates
tide,
what
do
we
do
here,
because
this
other
question
isn't
here,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
so
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
if
we
think
there
wasn't
enough
here
to
make
him
a
seaman
of
the
gates
tide,
that's
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
even
if
we
think
that's
true,
isn't
there
this
element
of
whether
he
has
to
be
permanently
attached
to
the
vessel?
justice
o'connor
here
he
was
just
hauled
around
for
a
few
days
on
the
gates
tide,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
would
you
speak
so
that
we
can
all
share
in
your
response
to
the
questions?
justice
o'connor
how
about
workers
on
the
platform
itself
out
there
in
the
gulf?
how
are
they
covered
if
they're
not
seamen?
justice
o'connor
no,
i
said
in
the
persian
gulf.
justice
o'connor
that's
right,
on
a
platform
in
the
persian
gulf.
what
covers
that
worker?
justice
o'connor
so
perhaps
nothing
unless
local
law
provided
it?
justice
o'connor
would
you
tell
me
why
you
think
we
need
to
be
concerned
about
the
so-called
aid
in
navigation
test
as
opposed
to
looking
at
whether
someone
is
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
and
sufficiently
attached
and
doing
the
mission?
what
does
aid
in
navigation
add
to
that?
justice
o'connor
mrs.
bercier--
justice
o'connor
--would
you
help
me
where
exactly
what
question
we
have
to
answer
here.
is
it
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claim?
apparently
our
courts
have
left
the
answer
to
what
is
a
seaman
to
be
determined
as
a...
by
the
tryer
effect,
in
this
case
a
jury.
justice
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
perhaps
it
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact,
but
our
cases
don't
talk
in
those
terms,
do
they?
justice
o'connor
that's
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
it
could
be
other
than
a
mixed
question,
but
assuming
it's
not,
what
do
we
answer
here?
whether
certain
evidence
is
relevant
or
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient,
or
both,
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
o'connor
well,
are
we
reviewing
instructions
to
the
jury
then?
what
are
we
looking
at
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
difference
does
that
make
if
the
jury
didn't
have
the
test?
i
don't
understand
what
it
is
we're
looking
at
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
one
must
aid
in
the
navigation
of
a
vessel
in
order
to
qualify
for
recovery
for
injury
sustained
as
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
we
today,
hold
there
is
no
such
requirement.
the
jones
act
provides
a
cause
of
action
and
negligence
for
any
seaman
injured
in
the
course
of
employment.
the
act
does
not
define
seaman,
but
that
term
is
a
maritime
word
of
art.
in
the
absence
of
contrary
indication,
we
assume
congress
used
the
word
as
admiralty
courts
had
used
at
under
general
maritime
law.
on
a
review
of
that
maritime
case
law,
we
think
it
was
settled
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
jones
act
back
in
1920,
that
maritime
law
did
not
require
that
a
seaman
aid
in
navigation
of
the
vessel.
the
source
of
the
conflict
we
resolve
today
is
this
court’s
inconsistent
use
of
an
aid
and
navigation
requirement
in
various
cases
arising
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
and
the
jones
act.
we
believe
the
better
rule
is
to
define
seaman
under
the
jones
act
solely
in
terms
of
the
employee’s
connection
to
a
vessel
in
navigation.
this
rule
best
explains
our
case
law
and
is
consistent
with
the
pre-jones
act
interpretation
of
seaman,
and
with
the
land
based,
sea-based
distinction
congress
created
with
the
longshoremans
act
and
the
jones
act.
the
key
to
seaman
status,
we
hold,
is
employment
related
connection
to
a
vessel
and
navigation.
a
necessary
element
of
that
connection
is
that
the
seaman
performed
the
work
of
a
vessel.
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
seaman
aid
in
navigation
or
a
contribute
to
the
transportation
of
the
vessel,
but
a
seaman
must
be
doing
the
ship’s
work.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
