i
have
just
one.
justice
stevens
you
referred
to
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
the
senko
case?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
we
have
to
overrule
the
senko
case
in
order
to
sustain
your
position?
justice
stevens
have
we
ever
passed
on
the
bartender,
dance
instructor
example?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
justice
douglas
did
seem
to
think
it
necessary
to
say
he
contributed
to
the
navigation
function
of
the
vessel?
justice
stevens
but
maybe--
justice
stevens
--well,
maybe
so,
but
he
did
seem
to
think
navigation
was
an
ingredient
of
the
test
and
you're
really
arguing
that
it's
not.
well,
resume
there
at
1:00,
mrs.
bercier.
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
the
helicopter
were
a
vessel
the
pilot
would
clearly
be
a
seaman.
justice
stevens
and
vice
versa
i
assume?
