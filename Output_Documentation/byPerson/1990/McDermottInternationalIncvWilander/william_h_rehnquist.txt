chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
next
in
no.
89-1474,
mcdermott
international
v.
jon
c.
wilander.
mr.
doyle,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
take
a
vessel
different
than
the
one
we're
talking
about
here,
mr.
doyle.
how
about
the
mess
crew
on
the
vessel
or
people
who
are
just
there
to
repair
in
case
things
go
wrong?
are
they
not
seamen
under
your
definition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
they
don't
have
to
participate
in
the
actual
steering
of
the
ship,
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
true
of
repair
people,
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question
about
the
harpooner
on
a
whale
boat.
why
is
the
respondent
wilander
different?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
added
that
one
wasn't
in
maritime
commerce,
but
that's
simply
adding
on
something
to
the
mission
of
the
ship
that
i
hadn't
understood
from
your
previous
definition.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
can't
you
answer
the
question
any
more
shortly
than
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
difference?
well,
what
the
difference?
why
does
one
obtain
it
and
the
other
doesn't?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
see
you're
giving
two
separate
answers
it
seems.
maybe
i
misunderstand
you.
but
i
thought
at
first
was
that
the
boat
that
mr.
wilander
was
on...
he
did
nothing
'til
he
got...
'til
it
stopped
and
he
was
there
to
paint
and
then
he
painted.
but
there's
something
more
to
your
answer
than
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
now
is
that
a
requirement
under
this
act?
we're...
if
we...
to
have
a
more
all-encompassing
voyage?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
him.
and
he
does
much
of
his
work
from
the
vessel,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
did
you
say
then
that
he
does
most
of
his
work
off
the
vessel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
he
were...
if
he
lived
on
this
boat
and
it
went
out
to
paint
other
boats
regularly,
would
you
agree
that
he
was
a
seaman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
does
that
you
bring
up
to
answer
my
question,
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
that
he
lived
on
this
boat...
this
boat
that
did
nothing
but
paint
other
boats
and
they...
it
painted
other
boats
regularly,
he
still
is
not
a
seaman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
why
is
he
not
a
seaman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
although
whale
harpooners
do?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
doyle.
mrs.
bercier?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
fifth
circuit
rely
on
this
theory
that
you're
expounding
on,
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
didn't.
so
you're
not
really
defending
the
reasoning
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
as
to
whether
he
was
attached
to
a
group
of
vessels.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
members
of
the
crew
of
the
gates
tide
do
their
painting
while
they
were
on
the
gates
tide?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
gates
tide
would
not
have
accomplished
its
mission
if
it
had
simply
dropped
these
people
off
on
the
boat
and
then
gone
back.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mrs.
bercier,
are
you
suggesting
that
our
previous
cases
say
that
no
matter
how
little
evidence
would
support
a
finding
of
the
person
being
a
seaman
that's
nonetheless
good
enough
if
the
jury
finds
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
presumably
in
some
cases
conversely
that
a
person
was
not
a
seaman
as
a
matter
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
bercier,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
bercier.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
doyle,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
didn't
it
remain
on
the
vessel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
doyle.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1474,
mcdermott
international
verus
wilander
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
