justice

do
you
think
your...
the
seventh
circuit
agrees
with
your
view?
justice
white
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
contribute
to
the
function
of
the
vessel
and
navigation?
justice
white
that
doesn't
sound
like
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
white
well,
let
me...
how
do
you
differ
then
with
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
white
well,
what
about
a...
what
about
a
fishing
boat?
they're
going
to
go
whale
hunting
and
they
take
along
a
guy
that
knows
how
to
spear
whales.
he
doesn't
do
anything
to
the
vessel.
he
just
rides
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
see
a
wnale.
and
he
harpoons
it.
now
he
certainly
is
the...
he
is
performing
the
entire
mission
of
the
vessel.
they
want
to
get
a
whale
and
this
fellow
involved
in
this
case,
the
whole
reason
for
this...
for
this
ship
he's
on
is
to
go
around
and
tie
up
and
let
the
fellow
paint,
just
like...
instead
of
harpooning
a
whale
he's
doing
some
painting,
which
is
the
only
reason
that
vessel
runs
around.
justice
white
so,
so
if
this
fellow
had
been...
while
the
boat
that
he
was...
the
boat
where
he
was
living
and
operating...
if
he
had
been
hurt
on
the
way
would
he
have
been
a
seaman?
justice
white
well,
it
would
have
been
in
navigation.
justice
white
he
would
have
been...
and
his
being
carried
to
do
his
mission
is
certainly
part
of
the
boat's
mission.
justice
white
no,
go
ahead.
justice
white
well,
that
still
doesn't
get
to
why...
you
mean
just
that
because
the
vessel
has
stopped
and
tied
up,
he
suddenly
changes
from
a
seaman
to
a
nonseaman?
justice
white
that
wasn't
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
white
all
he
did...
his
only
job
on
that
ship
is
to...
is
when
they
get
into
whale
territory
to
get
up
there
and
look
and
be
ready.
mr.
doyle--
justice
white
well,
he
lived
on
it,
didn't
he?
justice
white
oh.
justice
white
yes,
but
it's
the
reason
the
ship...
that
boat
even
moves.
justice
white
there
aren't
too
many
of
them,
are
there?
justice
white
how
many?
5?
6?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
but
you're
not
defending
that,
is
that
it?
justice
white
are
you
defending
that
or
not?
justice
white
i
thought
you
were
asking
that
perhaps
we
could
affirm
for
another
reason...
that
he
was
a
member
of...
he
was
a
seaman
in
terms
of
a
whole
group
of
vessels?
justice
white
but
in
any
event
the
jury
is
supposed
to
be
accurately
instructed
about
what
the
law
is.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
seventh
circuit
would
consider
a
bartender
a
seaman?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
weren't
there...
wasn't
there
machinery
on
the
vessel
that
aided
in
the
painting?
justice
white
so
it
was
a
painting...
so
it
was
a
vessel
that
was
used
in
the
painting
of
these
platforms.
justice
white
that
was
its
mission.
justice
white
although
you
know
that
the
vessel
had
the
equipment
on
it
and
it
stayed
on
it.
