yes,
by
of
course,
this
rule
deals
with
written
submissions
where
presumably
the
person
has
time
to
check
the
facts
and
so
forth,
so
it's
a
special...
specially
limitative
context.
would
you
tell
me
precisely
what
written
papers
form
the
basis
of
the
sanction
in
this
case...
just--
justice
stevens
--which
was
signed
of
course
by
the
attorney
and
not
by
the
client?
justice
stevens
so
it's
the
motion
to
tro
is
one.
justice
stevens
and
that's
the...
that's
the
affidavit.
justice
stevens
may
i
just...
i'm
sorry,
but--
justice
stevens
--the
sanction
against
the
corporation
as
opposed
to
the
original
sanction
against
the
law
firm,
which
i
know
is
later,
was
for
signing
for
both
the
motion
and
supporting
papers
or
just
the
latter?
justice
stevens
both,
yeah.
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
can
i
raise
with
you
the
question
that
justice
scalia
has
been
raising?
the
first
sentence
of
the
rule
requires
certain
papers
to
be
signed
by
a
lawyer,
if
the
party
is
represented
by
a
lawyer.
in
this
case
the...
your
opponent
was
represented
by
a
lawyer
at
all
times.
justice
stevens
so
does
the
rule
encompass
any
other
papers
than
those
which
a
lawyer
must
sign?
justice
stevens
it
must
be
read
as,
but
the
plain
language--
justice
stevens
--even
if
they
need
not
be
signed
by
an
attorney?
justice
stevens
because
the
first
sentence
just
refers
to
papers
that
shall
be
signed
by
an
attorney?
justice
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
the
first
sentence
is,
is
not
as
broad
as
the
rest
of
the
rule?
justice
stevens
--that
separate
opinion
was
not
exactly
overwhelming
indorsed
by
the
rest
of
the
court.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
how
do
you...
how
do
you
deal
with
the
language,
"the
rule
and
sanction
that
can
be
imposed
against
the
person
who
signed
it,
the
party
or
both.
"
even
only
one
person
signed
it?
