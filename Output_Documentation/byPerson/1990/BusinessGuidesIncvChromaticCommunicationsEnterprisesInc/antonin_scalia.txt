that
you
left
out
in
your
quotation
in
your
brief
unfortunately.
justice
scalia
no,
no,
but
that...
it
would
have
made
it
clearer
had
you
put
it
in
there.
it
does...
the
first
sentence
says,
every
pleader
shall
be
signed
by
an
attorney,
and
the
second
one
says,
a
party
who
is
not
represented
by
an
attorney
shall
sign
the
pleading,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
scalia
and
then
it
said
a
signing
by
an
attorney
or
party,
and
what
you're
saying
that
reference
to
party
refers
back
to
the
sentence
that
you
left
out.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
possible
to
interpret
rule
11
as
covering...
it
says
pleading
motion
or
other
paper.
why,
why
shouldn't
other
paper
be
interpreted
to
mean
another
paper
that
deals
with
the
conduct
of
the
litigation.
i
mean,
the
rule
talks...
makes
a
distinction
between
when
you're
represented
by
counsel
and
when
you're
not
represented
by
counsel.
that
distinction
makes
no
sense
except
with
respect
to
control
of
the
litigation.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
scalia
and
not
with
respect
to
general
affidavits
about
any
factual
matters.
justice
scalia
have
you
argued
that
here?
justice
scalia
you
might
have
a
different
rule
for
a
person
appearing
as
a
witness
than
you
have
for
a
person
who
manages
the
litigation
before
the
court,
who
is
the
attorney
or
acting
as
the
attorney
on
his
own
behalf.
i
don't
think
that
what
you
do
on
the
one
situation
indicates
what
you
do
on
the
other.
so,
if
rule
11
is
only
limited
to
persons
managing
the
litigation,
that
explanation
would
be
quite
reasonable.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
with
respect
to
both
of
these
was
the
signature
the
company
by
somebody
or...
the
verification
on
the
complaint,
was
that
verification
by
an
individual
or
was
it
by
literally
a
party?
was
it
by
the
company?
justice
scalia
but
i
want
to
know
was
it
signed
business
guides
by
somebody...
it
was
signed...
the
individual's
name?
justice
scalia
by--
justice
scalia
--so
it
was
signed...
it
was
verified
by
the
party--
justice
scalia
--which
is
what
this
rule
refers
to,
the
party,
not
an
employee
of
the
party,
which
is
the
party.
justice
scalia
now,
this
latter
affidavit--
justice
scalia
--was
not
signed
by
business
guides.
justice
scalia
it
was
just
signed
by
the
individual.
justice
scalia
so
it
was
not
signed
by
the
party.
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
it
was
found
below
that
the
attorney
was
not...
was
not
guilty
of
a
rule
11
violation
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
the
attorney
was
not...
was
there
a
finding
that
the
client
was?
justice
scalia
of
course,
that's
separate
opinion--
justice
scalia
please,
just
so
i'm
sure
about
it.
what...
was...
because
i
have
trouble
with
the
latter
affidavit...
was
the
sanction
based
independently
upon
the...
upon
the
party's
signing
of
the
originally
complaint,
independently
upon
that?
justice
scalia
you
concede
that
filing
a
civil
law
suit
constitutes
petitioning
the
government
for
redress
of
grievances?
justice
scalia
you,
you
don't
think
grievances
mean
grievances
against
the
government?
justice
scalia
you
think
it
could
be
first
to
petition
of
the
government
for
redress
of
your
grievance
against
a
third
party?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
as
i
understand
it,
however,
you
can't
get
to
the
client
even
if
the
client
doesn't
have
a...
reasonable
belief.
you
can't
even
get
to
the
client
unless
the
attorney
that
represents
him
is
in
violation
of
the
rule.
if
you
have
a
paper
that
need
only
be
signed
by
the
attorney,
it's
clear
that
unless
the
attorney
is
in
violation,
you
can...
cannot
impose
a
sanction
upon
the
client
under
rule
11,
isn't
that
so?
justice
scalia
and
would
that
apply
for
complaints?
is
there
any
requirement
in
the
rules
that
a
complaint
must
be
verified
by
the
party?
justice
scalia
quite
so.
but
if
the
attorney
did
make
a
reasonable
inquiry--
justice
scalia
--but
the
client
didn't,
and
thereby
misled
the
attorney,
there's
no
problem.
you
can't...
you
can't
reach
either
one.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
and
assuming
the
client
didn't
sign
the
paper?
justice
scalia
well,
it
really...
it
really
was
signed
by
the
party
technically,
absolutely
technically.
it
was
signed
by
an
employee
of
the
party.
justice
scalia
where
you
say...
you
just
said
a
moment
ago
that
there's
no
problem
since
the
party
did
sign
the
complaint.
well,
that
depends
upon
whether
you
read
rule
11
as
applying
to
all
signatures,
whether
they're
required
or
not.
in
other
words,
if
the
certification
was
not
required
by
rule
11
you
might
argue
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
there
does
not
justify
imposing
a
sanction
because
of
it.
justice
scalia
and
is
that
the
case
when
client
is
representing
himself
as
well,
so
that
you
have
nobody
to
go
against
for
simply
no
reasonable
inquiry?
or
are
you
proposing
this
rule
only
when
you're
going
behind
the
lawyer
to
get
the
client?
