justice
kennedy
well,
on
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
concedes
the
proposition
that
there
can
be
a
rule
11
violation
by
the
client
and
not
by
the
attorney.
justice
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
based
on
your
reading
of
the
rule
you
could
take
the
argument
a
step
further
and
say
that
a
predicate
to
a
rule
11
violation
is
a
violation
by
the
attorney
when
the
party's
represented.
but
there
must
be
an
attorney
violation
before
you
can
even
consider
imposing
sanctions
on
the
attorney.
yet
you
don't
seem
to
argue
that...
on
the
client.
yet
you
don't
seem
to
argue
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
necessary
follow
if
you
say
that
the
purpose
of
rule
11
is
to
control
the
conduct
of
attorneys
as
they
control
litigation.
justice
kennedy
oh,
i
think
it
might
be
quite
usual
that
clients
might
often
mislead
attorneys
deliberately.
justice
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
sanctions
in
28
u.s.c.
and
in
the
law
of
malicious
prosecution
that
cover
that
base
without
extending
rule
11
to
do
so.
but
you
don't
seem
to
argue
that.
justice
kennedy
so
that
every
affidavit
must
be
signed
by
the
attorney?
justice
kennedy
well,
why,
if
other
paper
means
every
document
filed
with
the
court?
justice
kennedy
and
in
your
view
the
rule
11
sanction
could
be
sustained
based
simply
on
the
complaint?
justice
kennedy
but
in
this...
in
this
action
what
do
you
think
constitute
the
gravamen
of
the
rule
11
violation,
which
papers?
justice
kennedy
if
any
one
of
those
papers
were
admitted
would
they
be...
were
excluded
from
our
discussion
would
there
still
be
a
rule
11
violation?
justice
kennedy
when
a
civil
litigant
files
an
action
with
the
court
is
not
an
exercise
of
the
right
of
petition
under
the
first
amendment,
and
if
so,
do
you
know
of
any
authority
which
holds
a
party
monetarily
liable
based
on
an
objective
standard
for
the
exercise
of
a
right
of
petition?
this
is
a
very
far-reaching
rule
you're
making
here.
justice
kennedy
yes,
yes,
but
what
you're
doing
is
you're
saying
that
there's
a
liability
based
on
an
objective
standard
judged
by
the
content
of
what
is
spoken.
justice
kennedy
and
i
think
that's
a
far-reaching
rule.
justice
kennedy
under
an
objective
standard?
justice
kennedy
so,
in
this
case
if
the
court...
district
court,
were
wrong
and
we
stipulate
that
there
was
no
rule
11
violation
for
filing
the
complaint
and
signing
the
complaint,
then
case
has
to
fail?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
that
so,
because
what,
what
paper
did
the
attorney
sign
other
than
the
complaint?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
were
the
papers,
other
than
the
complaint,
that
the
attorney
signed?
