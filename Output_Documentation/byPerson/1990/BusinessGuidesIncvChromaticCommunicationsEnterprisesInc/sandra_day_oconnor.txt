justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
bomse,
why
isn't
it
consistent
with
the
rule
and
with
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
rule
11
to
impose
a
reasonable
inquiry
standard
on
parties
when
they
have
occasion
to
file
with
the
court,
for
example,
factual
affidavits
or
declarations
in
support
of
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
restraining
order
or
an
injunction?
why
isn't
that
reasonable
inquiry
standard
applicable
to
parties?
justice
o'connor
the
rule
itself
doesn't
draw
a
distinction,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
i...
you
know,
it's
possible
i
think
to
conclude
that
what's
reasonable
for
a
party
to
make
an
inquiry
might
be
somewhat
different
for
what's
reasonable
for
an
attorney.
but
it
would
appear
that
the
same
standard
would
apply.
justice
o'connor
well,
in
any
event...
in
any
event
here
i
gather
they...
the
documents
in
question
were
signed
by
the
attorney
as
well
as
by
the
party?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
shapiro,
the
rule,
though,
speaks
in
terms
of
imposing
sanctions
only
on
people
who
have
signed
the
relevant
papers.
if
the
client
does
not
sign,
how
is
it
the
client
could
ever
be
held
liable
under
the
terms
of
the
rule?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
a
curious
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
rule,
isn't
it,
which
speaks
only
in
terms
of
if
a
paper
is
signed
in
violation
of
the
rule,
then
the
court
may
impose
upon
the
person
who
signed
it,
a
represented
party
or
both...
or
both...
an
appropriate
sanction?
so
apparently
it
speaks
in
terms
only
people
who
have
signed.
justice
o'connor
in
any
event,
both
have
signed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
allows
a
judge
to
impose
sanctions
when
signed
documents
are
filed
that
had
no
basis
in
law
or
fact,
imposes
an
objective
standard
of
reasonable
inquiry
on
a
represented
party
who
signed
such
a
document.
we
hold
that
it
does.
the
petitioner,
business
guides,
filed
a
copyright
infringement
action
in
federal
court
against
the
respondent,
chromatic
communications.
representatives
of
the
plaintiff
company
signed
the
complaint
and
a
supporting
affidavit.
the
district
court
learned
that
the
law
suit
had
absolutely
no
basis
in
fact,
sighting
the
seriousness
of
business
guidesâ€™
improper
conduct.
the
court
invoked
rule
11
and
imposed
monetary
sanctions
of
the
amount
that
the
defendant
had
spent
defending
the
suit.
business
guides
appealed
claiming
that
rule
11
applies
to
attorneys,
not
to
represented
parties.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
the
purpose
of
rule
11
is
to
curve
abuses
of
the
judicial
system.
it
does
this
by
imposing
a
certification
requirement.
a
pleading,
or
other
paper
filed
with
the
court
must
bear
the
signature
of
an
attorney
or
a
party.
and
that
signature
certifies
that
the
signer
has
conducted
a
reasonable
inquiry
to
ensure
that
the
document
is
well-grounded
in
the
facts
and
the
law.
the
text
of
rule
11
makes
clear
that
it
applies
equally
the
signatures
of
attorneys
and
of
parties.
we
hold
that
a
represented
party,
who
signs
a
pleading
motion
or
other
paper,
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
conduct
a
reasonable
inquiry
into
the
facts
and
the
law,
and
the
standard
is
one
of
reasonableness
under
the
circumstances.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
marshall
and
stevens
have
joined
and
as
to
parts
one,
three,
and
four
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
