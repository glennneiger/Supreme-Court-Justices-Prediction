mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
key
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
represented
party
who
authorizes
and
participates
directly
in
the
filing
of
a
meritless
action
without
performing
anything
that
even
comes
close
to
a
reasonable
inquiry
into
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
held
accountable
for
the
direct
economic
consequences
which
flow
from
his
actions.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
factual
hypothesis
of
that
question
is
in
fact
in
the
record
before
you
and
that
the
answer
to
the
question
itself
is
most
assuredly
in
the
affirmative.
raised
by
petitioner,
and
in
fact
the
focus
of
petitioner's
petition
and
argument
today,
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
conduct
of
such
a
represented
party
should
be
judged
by
an
objective
standard
or
by
a
subjective
one.
for
reasons
which
i
will
discuss,
we
urge
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
rule
11
leads
to
the
application
of
an
objective
standard
to
such
a
party
when
viewed
from
the
bench
mark
perspectives
of
statutory
or
rule
construction,
public
policy,
or
judicial
case
management.
as
i
believe
business
guides
agrees,
we
should
start
the
interpretive
process
with
the
words
of
the
rule
or
statute
at
issue.
in
fact,
this
court
said
last
term
in
the
pavelic
case,
we
give
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
their
plain
meaning
and
generally
with
them
as
with
the
statute,
when
we
find
the
terms
unambiguous,
judicial
inquiry
is
complete.
we
submit
that
the
words
themselves
of
rule
11
are
substantially
unambiguous
as
they
apply
to
the
facts
now
before
the
court.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
correct.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
believe
by
its
very
terms
it
must
be
read
as
incorporating
other
papers.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
well,
i
believe
the
words
of
the
rule
when
it
speaks
of
"pleading,
motion,
or
other
paper.
"
intends
to
encompass
within
its
reach
all
papers
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
correct,
such
as--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
am
saying
that,
yes.
i
believe
the
rule
expands
its
application
as
one
reads
it.
and
i
also
think
it
important
to
note
that
nowhere
in
the
rule
is
there
a
statement
that
it
applies
to
counsel
and
pro
se
litigants
only.
it
applies
to
any
writing
before
the
court.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
no,
no.
no,
i'm
saying
the
first
rule
says
that
essentially
every
complaint
must
be
signed
by
the
attorney.
affidavits
are
not
signed
by
counsel,
but
by,
in
this
instance,
parties,
or
it
could
be
by--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--because
i
believe
when
drafting
the
rule
the
framers
of
the
rule
had
in
mind
the
fact
that
certain
documents
initiating
a
legal
proceeding
such
as
a
complaint,
certain
other
documents
such
as
motions,
must
be
signed
by
counsel
or
by
a
party
appearing
without
counsel.
but
i
believe
that
the
drafters
recognized
that
there
were
other
documents
which
can
be
signed
by
parties
themselves.
and
i
believe
it
was
the
intention
of
the
rule
to
apply
to
those
other
documents
and
to
the
parties
that
signed
them
the
reasonable
inquiry
requirement.
and
i
suggest
that--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--the
complaint
itself
was
signed
by
both.
the
declarations
were
not.
the
temporary
restraining
order
application
was
signed
by
counsel.
it
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
signed
by
a
representative
of
the
client.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
think
it
clear
from
some
of
the
court's
previous
opinions
that
it
is
frequently
loathe
to
hold
a
party
responsible
for
misconduct
of
a
lawyer
with
which
it
had
no
participation
and
that
raises
the
possibility
of
a
complaint
being
signed
by
a
lawyer
in
violation
of
the
rule
but
without
any
wrong
on
the
part
of
the
client.
in
this
instance--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--the
original
complaint
and
the
temporary
restraining
order
package
if
you
will
including
the
moving
papers
and
the
affidavit,
together
with
the
supplemental
affidavit
of
michael
lamb,
and
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--i
don't
it
would
be
possible
to
exclude
the
complaint
itself
from
the
discussion,
and
that
was
a
document
signed
both
by
the
party
and
by
the
attorney
and
it
posited
a
case
based
on
false,
totally
false
evidence.
it
would
hard
i
think
to
carve
that
out
of
the
application
of
rule
11.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
with
respect
to
the
initial
filing
of
the
complaint--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
yes,
directly.
i
think
it's
also
helpful
to
look
at
the
words
of
justice
stevens
in
a
separate
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
cooter
&
gell.
justice
stevens
noted
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
false
or
frivolous
affidavit
in
response
to
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
can
be
sanctioned
for
that
filing.
i
find
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
draw
a
meaningful
distinction
from
a
plaintiff
who
files
a
false
or
frivolous
affidavit
in
support
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
one
who
does
so
in
support
of
an
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
indeed
i
could
posit
the
argument
i
think
with
good,
with
good
heart,
that
it
is
worse
when
seeking
a
temporary
restraining
against
a
small
competitor
to
file
a
declaration
that
is
based
on
false
facts
because,
in
the
case
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
that
the
matter
will
remain
the
federal
judicial
system.
the
other
circumstance--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--is
the
worse
that
could
happen
is
the
economic
death
of
the
party
against
whom
the
temporary
restraining
order
is
sought
based
on
that
false
declaration.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
but
i
think
its
words
still
have
much
wisdom
to
them--
[laughter]
--and
much
application
to
what's
before
us.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
the
district
court
found
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
two
violations
of
rule
11
on
the
part
of
the
party.
the
first
was
the
filing
of
the
initial
packet
of
papers,
which
include
the
complaint,
the
application
for
temporary
restraining
order
with
the
affidavit
as
part
of
it.
the
court
found
a
second
violation,
and
that
was
in
the
submission
of
a
supplemental
affidavit
some
6
or
7
days
later
and
on
the
eve
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
hearing.
for
what
it
is
worth,
the
court
pointed
out
that
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
second
affidavit,
it
had
become
abundantly
clear
that
the
sole
corporate
document,
the
sole
record,
upon
which
plaintiff
relied...
it
relied
in
bringing
the
action
had
been
found
to
be
terribly
flawed,
yet
there
was
no
further
inquiry.
the
application
of
an
objective
standard,
i
submit
to
you,
not
only
has
the
support
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
what
standard
to
apply
for
lawyers
and
for
unrepresented
parties,
but
i
think
it
draws
some
support
from
an
analysis
of
the
rule
itself
and
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
adopted.
now,
i
concede
that
neither
the
rule
itself
nor
the
advisory
committee
note
speaks
directly
to
the
standard
by
which
one
shall
judge
the
conduct
of
a
represented
party.
but
i
think
there
are
certain
things
that
we
may
look
to
to
aid
us
in
interpreting
whether
that
was
the
intention
of
the
rule.
i
think
first
and
foremost
is
the
1983
amendments
to
the
rule
removed
references
to
bad
faith.
implicit
in
that,
i
submit,
was
the
intention
to
adopt
an
objective
standard.
to
the
extent
that
one
wishes
to
read
the
rule
as
only
allowing
sanctioning
of
a
party
for
subjective
bad
faith,
amending
the
rule
at
all
as
it
related
to
parties,
and
it
was
amended
by
speaking
of
represented
parties,
would
have
been
entirely
unnecessary
and
a
futile
lack.
this
court
has
the
inherent
power
and
has
always
had
the
inherent
power
to
sanction
a
party
for
frivolous
or
bad-faith
conduct.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
believe
that
the
fair
of
the
rule
and
interpretation
of
the
rule
using
standard
methods
of
interpretation
leads
to
that
conclusion.
what
i'm
suggesting
or
conceding
is
that
the
rule
does
not
say
that
a
represented
party
shall
only
be
responsible
for
sanctions
in
the
case
of
bad
faith,
nor
does
it
expressly
say
that,
yes,
we
mean
a
represented
party
as
judged
by
the
same
objective
standard
as
is
applied
to
an
unrepresented
party.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
the
inference
i
draw
from
the
words
the
court
has
just
read
and
the
words
of
the
rule
in
toto
is
that
the
objective
standard
is
the
apt
one
for
everyone.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
very
definitely
agree
with
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
i
was
going
to
say
earlier,
the
wording
of
the
rule,
the
signature
of
any
attorney
or
party
constitutes
a
certificate
by
the
signer
that
the
signer
has
read
the
pleading,
motion,
or
other
paper
that
to
the
best
of
the
signer's
knowledge,
information,
and
belief,
formed
after
reasonable
inquiry,
it
is
well
grounded
in
fact,
et
cetera.
i
submit
to
you
that
a
fair
reading
of
that,
and
using
all
proper
methods
of
statutory
rule
interpretation
suggests,
that
when
it
says
the
signer,
it
means
the
signer,
whether
an
attorney
or
party.
and
if
a
party
whether
represented
or
in
pro
per.
but
i
think
if
we
go
further
and
look
at
some
of
the,
the
other
factors
as
i
was
mentioning,
i
think
they
simply
bolster
the
conclusion
that
the
objective
standard
was
intended
and
is
appropriate.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
no,
i
don't,
although
i
think
i
could
posit
one.
certainly,
standing
outside
this
court
and
protesting
a
decision
it
has
made
or
has
failed
to
make
would
constitute
arguably
petitioning
one's
government
for
redress
of
grievances.
but
i
think
it
might
also
violate
various
trespass
laws
or
other
laws
regarding
civil
behavior,
which
by
their
nature
are
not
judged
on
a
subjective
standard
but
by
an
objective
standard.
if
i
have
trespassed,
i
have
trespassed,
whether
i
intended
to
or
not.
and
if
i
have
trespassed
on
government
property
to
petition
that
same
government
for
redress
of
grievances,
i
will
be
held
accountable
criminally
based
on
an
objective--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--no,
i
think--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--in
this...
in
this
instance,
based
on
the
content,
only
if
that
content
is
characterized
properly
as
false
as
having
been
subscribed
to--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--yes.
well,
i
think
in
this
case
it's
somewhat
easy
in
that
the
facts
are
false.
that
has
been
determined
by
the
district
court.
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it
that
the
action
has
absolutely
no
factual
basis
whatsoever.
that
was
a
factor
in
its
decision
to
dismiss
the
action.
the
review
of--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--i
believe
an
argument
to
that
effect
could
be
made.
i
cannot
honestly
say
that
i've
seen
a
case
that
says
that
it
does,
although
i
can
understand
that
kind
of
argument
being
posited,
yes.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
think
that's
the
intent.
i'm
simply
saying--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--normally,
that's
what
i
say,
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
that
applies
it
in
that
context,
but
i
would
concede
that
one
could
make
that
argument.
i
view
it
as
a
constitutional
right
to
petition
my
government
for
a
grievance
of
mine
as
to
that
government,
not
as
to
some
third
party.
i
would
never
foreclose
the
creativity
of
counsel
in
making
an
argument
to
the
contrary.
[laughter]
i
think
in
looking
at
rule
11
also
and
the
question
of
whether
the
conduct
of
a
represented
party
and
an
unrepresented
party
should
be
judged
by
a
different
standard,
i
think
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
there
is
in
fact
any
fundamental
difference
between
the
two.
yes,
one
had
taken
on
the
burden,
if
you
will,
of
representing
himself
in
a
system
somewhat
alien
to
him.
but
nevertheless
he
is
a
party.
he
is
not
trained
as
a
lawyer.
in
reviewing
his
conduct
under
the
objective
standard,
the
courts
will
take
into
account
his
absence
of
legal
training
and
the
fact
that
he
will
not
be
held
to
perhaps
precisely
the
same
standards
as
i
would
expect
this
court
would
hold
me
or
mr.
bomse
or
anyone
else
before
it.
is
a
represented
party
that
different?
both
are
knowledgeable
about
the
facts
of
their
case.
both
have
as
their
primary
role
in
the
litigation
the
presentation
of
those
facts,
first
to
their
counsel
and
then
to
the
court.
to
say
that
one
who
has
the
benefit
for
whatever
reason
of
having
counsel
is
not
held
to
the
same
standard
of
care,
if
you
will,
as
one
who
is
not
to
me
makes
no
sense
and
has
no
basis
in
the
rule.
finally,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
inferential
basis
in
the
rule
in
reading
its
terms
to
distinguish
between
parties
who
are
represented
and
parties
who
are
not.
the
latter
clearly
are
judged
by
the
objective
standard.
i
submit
that
the
former
should
be
as
well.
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
i
think
that
a
subjective
standard
brings
with
it
some
problems
that
probably
exceed
in
scope
the
value
of
the
rule
itself.
they
argue
by
their
discussion
really
for
an
objective
standard.
as
this
court
said
last
term,
the
primary
purpose
of
rule
11
is
to
deter
frivolous
litigation.
implicit
in
that
ruling,
however,
was
the
notion
i
believe
that
the
deterrence
should
be
accomplished
with
as
little
burden
on
the
court
as
possible.
the
court
even
noted
that
a
secondary
consideration
is
the
avoidance
of
unnecessary
satellite
proceedings.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
a
subjective
standard
would
not
cry
out
for
satellite
proceedings,
such
as
were
held
in
this
case
even
though
the
court
was
using
an
objective
standard.
i
think
it
takes
no
skilled
practitioner
of
liable
law
to
know
that
in
public
official
liable
law
perhaps
more
attention
is
spent
on
the
issue
on
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
than
on
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
charges
made.
determining
subjective
state
of
mind
is
neither
easy
nor
quick,
and
if
the
rule
is
intended
to
deter
abuse
without
burdening
the
court,
a
subjective
standard
simply
will
not
do
that.
to
the
extent
this
court
believes
there
is
value
in
the
attorney-client
relationship,
i
would
submit
that
a
subjective
standard
does
more
damage
to
that
relationship
than
could
an
objective
standard.
first,
it
impinges
on
the
attorney-client
privileged
communications
because
it
is
important
in
a
subjective
standard
to
determine
what
the
party
knew
and
what
it
thought
and
when.
it
also
i
think
creates
a
greater
prospect
of
client
and
attorney
blaming
each
other
and
pointing
fingers
at
each
other,
thus
destroying
whatever
might
remain
of
that
relationship.
all
of
that
of
course
would
occur
in
satellite
proceedings,
which
i
think
are
largely
unnecessary
under
an
objective
standard.
it
also
would
allow,
as
in
this
case,
a
party
to
say,
well,
i
got
all
my
facts
wrong,
i
didn't
check
them,
but
i
subjectively
believed
in
my
case
and
be
absolutely
immune
from
any
sanction
under
rule
11.
the
attorney
in
that
same
case
can
say,
well,
the
client
was
the
expert,
as
it
did
in
this
case.
we
relied
on
the
client
for
the
facts,
and
that
was
not
unreasonable.
so
on
an
objective
standard,
we're
immune
as
well.
i
don't
think
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
well
served
by
creating
such
a
distinction.
finally,
i
think
that
use
of
an
objective
standard
creates
an
even
application
of
the
rule
as
to
all
who
come
before
it:
attorney,
client,
or
unrepresented
party.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
would
agree,
yes.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
no,
there
is
not,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
rule
itself
in
its
application,
as
articulated
by
various
courts,
has
said
that
where
the
rule
is
violated
because
the
attorney
signed
the
complaint
and
the
attorney
did
not
make
a
reasonable
inquiry...
nor
did
his
client...
sanctions
may
be
imposed
on
the
attorney
or
the
client
or
both.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
assuming...
yes,
assuming
an
objective
standard
for
the
client
and
no
subjective
bad
faith
client
to
implicate
the
court's
inherent
power,
yes.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
correct.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
no,
i
don't
agree
that
that's
necessary.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
well,
the
attorney
signed
the
complaint
and
all
the
other
moving
papers
in
connection
with
the
temporary
restraining
application,
save
and
except
the
affidavit.
the
question
as
posited
by
justice
scalia
i
believe
was
aimed
at
the
initial
filing
of
a
complaint,
no
other
papers
filed,
can
the
party
be
sanctioned
for
the
lawyer's
violation
of
rule
11
in
connection
with
that
complaint.
that
i
think
is
a
fair
and
accurate
statement
of
the
law.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
if
the
client
signs
either
the
same
paper
or
subsequently
signs
other
papers
that
are
filed
with
court,
that
the
client
cannot
be
held
in
violation
of
rule
11
and
sanctioned
accordingly.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
other
than
the
complaint,
the
application
for
temporary
restraining
order
of
which
the
affidavit
was
a
supporting
piece,
the
legal
memorandum,
the
application
itself,
the
order
for
sealing
of
these
records
so
that
the
defendant
could
not
see
them.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
white,
no.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
no,
i
don't.
i
don't.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
if
only
the
attorney
is
at
all
blameworthy,
then
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
only
the
attorney
who
should
be
sanctioned.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
the
court--
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
--they
certainly
could
be
different
for
the
two
and
i
think
the
drafters
also
contemplated
the
circumstances
in
which
the
attorney's
signature
violates
the
rule
because
the
complaint
is
frivolous,
but
the
client
provided
the
facts,
and
the
court
may
determine
that
it
is
those
facts
which
make
it
a
frivolous
complaint.
the
attorney
should
have
checked
further.
had
he
done
so
he
would
not
have
violated
the
rule.
the
case
would
not
have
been
filed.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
as
i
read
the
rule,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
without
doubt
that
the
signer
can
be
sanctioned.
but
as
i
read
the
rule,
if
a
violation
occurs
because
of
the
signing
of
the
paper
in
violation
of
rule
11,
the
signer
himself,
which
normally
would
be
the
attorney,
may
be
sanctioned,
but
so
may
the
party
he
represents
depending
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
i
think
that
in
that
sense
that
the
rule
may
be
somewhat
ambiguous.
i
think
it
certainly
can
be
read
as
suggesting
that
whoever
signs
the
paper,
whether
an
attorney
or
represented
party,
can
be
held
liable
for
sanctions
for
the
violation
of
the
rule
occasioned
by
that
signing.
i
don't
think
it
forecloses
the
possibility.
and
i
think
some
courts
have
said
that
it
in
fact
honors
the
possibility
that
the
rule
11
violation
occurring
when
the
attorney
signs
the
complaint
may
be
attributable
to
misconduct,
if
you
will,
on
the
part
of
the
party;
and
the
court
in
that
circumstance
say
both
the
attorney
and
the
party
are
sanctioned
for
the
violation.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
yes,
i
was
going
to
say,
here,
fortunately
we
do
not
have
to
resolve
that
apparent
ambiguity
or
question
in
the
rule,
because
here
it
was
the
party
who
signed
some
of
the
key
documents.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
correct.
but
it
was...
i
would
submit
to
the
court
it
was
in
further
of
and
part
of
the
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
it
was
required
only
because
the
original
application
is
too
vague.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
it
has
to
be.
a
corporation
simply
cannot
sign
things
on
its
own.
mr.
neil
l.
shapiro
well,
one
might
view
it
that
way,
but
i
read
that
rule
as
saying
that
anyone
who
signs
a
document
which
is
going
to
be
filed
with
the
federal
court
must
make
the
reasonable
inquiry
called
for
by
the
rule,
even
if
that
document
needn't
be
signed
by
that
party.
now
in
this
case
an
affidavit
would
have
to
be
sworn
by
a
party
or
a
party
representative.
there
is
no
question,
and
i
think
it
was
the
third
circuit
that
spoke
to
this
in
gaiardo,
that
a
rule
11
violation
creates
multiple
victims.
certainly
the
judicial
system
and
all
those
who
come
before
it
or
who
attempt
to
come
before
it
but
must
wait
are
victims.
but
the
judicial
system
has
its
own
mechanisms
for
resolving
that
problem
and
for
attempting
to
assert
its
own
rights
against
counsel
who
would
violate
the
rule
or
against
parties
who
would
violate
the
rule.
but
there
are
other
victims
whenever
rule
11
is
violated.
and
in
this
case
another
such
victim
is
michael
shipp
and
his
small
company.
mr.
shipp
has
had
to
incur
fees
and
cost
in
this
case
from
the
inception
to
the
moment
and
presumably
beyond.
his
business
has
been
damaged.
he's
been
under
a
cloud
of
the
accusation
of
a
plagiarist
for
over
4
years.
the
action
was
dismissed,
but
that
is
still
on
appeal.
the
district
court
recognized
that
under
rule
11
it
could
not
do
complete
justice,
but
what
it
could
do
is
dismiss
the
case
both
as
a
sanction
for
the
violation
of
the
rule
and
because
it
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it
that
the
case
had
absolutely
no
factual
merit
whatsoever.
it
also
recognized
that
it
could
at
least
as
some
recompense
give
the
wrongfully
accused
defendant
those
limited
expenses
incurred
before
the
trial
court
itself.
it
did
that.
that
justice
was
all
it
could
do
or
at
least
all
it
believed
it
could
do
at
the
time
and
was
limited.
and
we
would
simply
ask
this
court
to
affirm
that
limited
grant
of
justice.
