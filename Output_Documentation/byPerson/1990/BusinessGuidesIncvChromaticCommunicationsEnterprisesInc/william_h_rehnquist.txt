mr.
bomse,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
does
the
term
chief
magistrate
mean,
mr.
bomse?
is
that
the
senior
magistrate
in
the
northern
district
of
california?
chief
justice
rehnquist
pretty
impressive
title.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bomse,
when
you
get
to
the
part
that
says
the
signature
of
any
attorney
or
party
constitutes
a
certificate
by
the
signer.
the...
then
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
formed
after
a
reasonable
inquiry
that
is
well-grounded
in
fact
and
is
warranted
by
existing
law.
that
sentence
surely
refers
both
the
party
and
the
attorney,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you...
certainly
that's
not
clear
from
the
language
i
just
read.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
concede
that
affidavits
are
filed
by
parties.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--represented
parties.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
this
wasn't
a
summary
judgment
motion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
rule
56
was
in
existence
at
the
time
that
rule
11
was
modified
to
its
present
form.
and
it
seems
to...
rule
11
seems
to
cover
a
lot
of
things
that
rule
56
obviously
didn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
bomse,
it
isn't
just
expenses.
certainly
the
judge
is
at
its
very
weakest
so
far
as
separating
truth
from
error
and
so...
on
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
where
there's
no
factual
record
developed,
it's
often
heard
largely
ex
parte.
and
that's
the
very
place
where
a
negligent
statement
by
a
client
can
really
do
damage,
because
there
isn't...
you
don't
have
discovery
in
that
sort
of
thing
before
you
get
a
temporary
restraining
order.
i
will
concede
that.
but
i
am
not
aware
of
virtually
any
other
rule
11
case,
and
we
are
after
all,
at
least
as
we
would
argue
it,
arguing
for
a
rule
of
interpretation
as
to
rule
11.
this
is
a
very
unique
set
of
circumstances.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
take
into
account
that
we
are
willing
to
tolerate
mistakes.
we
are
willing
indeed
to
tolerate
the
very
essence
of
the
american
rule
as
to
attorneys'
fees
is
that
we
tolerate
burdens
being
placed
on
people
who
are
found
sometimes,
justice
souter,
after
the
expenditure
of
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
dollars
and
years
in
discovery
before
a
summary
judgment
motion
is
granted.
we
do
not
in
this
country,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
and
other
countries
draw
the
policy
line
differently,
but
we
do
not
elect
to
impose
those
kind
of
burdens.
just
as
we
are
tolerate,
indeed
tolerant
beyond
anything
that
remotely
appears
in
this
case,
of
clients
in
the
form
of
witnesses
or
nonparty
witnesses
not
merely
being
mistaken
but
actually
getting
on
a
witness
stand
and
lying.
it
seems
to
me
the
court's
decision
in
briscoe
against
lahue
in
which
a
police
officer
had
testified
in
an
admittedly
perjured
fashion
was
the
nonetheless
held
to
be
absolutely
immune
specifically
because
of
the
concern
that
to
have
any
different
rule
would
unduly
chill
the
adversary
process.
mr.
bomse...
am
i
saying
your
name
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
say
that
there's
a
policy
that
witnesses
may
lie,
i
think
misconceives
it.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
our
opinion
in
briscoe
against
lahue
that
suggests
witnesses
are
not
subject
to
prosecution
for
perjury.
that
was
an
action
by
an
individual
against
another
individual
in
briscoe
against
lahue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
that
we
have
a
policy
that
tolerates
witnesses
lying
on
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--to
say
we
are
willing
to
tolerate
it
suggests
that
prosecutions
are
not
available
against
witnesses
who
perjure
themselves,
and
that
simply
isn't
the
case.
we
all
know
in
cases
we've
tried
probably
people
have
taken
the
stand
on
various
occasions
and
lied
and
weren't
prosecuted,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
remedy
isn't
available.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
lying
is
intentional
misconduct.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
a
party
is
a
corporate
party,
a
corporate
party
can't
verify.
that
has
to
be
verified
by
an
individual
on
behalf
of
the
party.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bomse.
mr.
shapiro,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
rule
itself
does
not
speak
directly
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
a
negligence
or
objective
standard
or
a
subjective
standard?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
where
the
rule
says
if
a
pleading
motion
or
other
papers
signed
in
violation
of
this
rule,
you
don't
think
that
says
one
way
or
the
other
whether
it
should
be
subjective
or
objective?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
so,
too,
because
the
preceding
sentence
says
"the
signature
of
any
attorney
or
party
formed
after
reasonable
inquiry.
"
--i
would
think
that
supports
your
position.
chief
justice
rehnquist
unless...
excuse
me.
the
supplemental
affidavit
was
signed
only
by
the
party?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
have
a
corporation
everything
is
done
by
the
party
will
be
done
by
some
employee
of
the
corporation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
bomse,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bomse.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1500,

guides

enterprises
