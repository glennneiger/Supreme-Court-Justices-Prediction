mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
action
began
as
a
suit
for
copyright
infringement.
it
was
filed
after
the
plaintiff
below,
business
guides,
that
it
had
detected
copying
of
entries
in
several
of
its
published
directories
put
out
by
the
defendant,
chromatic
communications.
unfortunately
much
of
the
evidence
of
defendant's
copying
turned
out
to
be
in
error.
when
that
became
apparent
to
the
district
court,
judge
called
a
halt
to
the
proceedings
and
referred
the
matter
to
the
chief
magistrate
to
determine
whether
sanctions
were
appropriate
against
both
business
guides
and
its
attorneys
under
rule
11.
the
magistrate
initially
concluded
that
business
guides
and
its
counsel
were
guilty
of
deliberate
misrepresentations
and
recommended
not
only
sanctions,
but
disciplinary
proceedings
against
plaintiff's
attorneys.
at
that
point
both
the
client
and
its
lawyers
retained
new
counsel,
who
were
able
to
demonstrate
in
a
subsequent
hearing
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
chief
magistrate
that
the
erroneous
filings
were
in
fact
a
product
of
error,
not
any
intended
desire
to
mislead
the
court
or
misuse
the
judicial
process.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i'm
sure
he
appreciates
it.
nonetheless,
while
the
magistrate
explicitly
found
that
neither
business
guides
nor
its
counsel
had
engaged
in
any
intended
misrepresentation
or
acted
for
any
improper
purpose,
nonetheless,
he
recommended
that
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
its
attorney
be
sanctioned
for
their
carelessness.
that
order
was
then
affirmed
first
by
the
district
court
and
then
by
the
court
of
appeals
over
business
guide's
contention
that
rule
11
does
not
permit
the
imposition
of
sanctions
against
a
represented
party
for
good-faith
errors.
it
is
that
question
which
is
now
before
this
court.
as
to
that
matter,
it
is
our
submission
that
while
there
is
no
doubt
that
rule
11,
properly
applied,
serves
not
only
a
salutary
but
a
necessary
purpose,
in
the
case
of
represented
parties
we
believe
that
purpose
can
be
fully
satisfied
by
limiting
that
application
of
the
rule
to
intentional
abuse
or
recklessness
that
is
substantially
its
equivalent.
it
is
our
view
that
construing
rule
11
in
that
fashion
is
not
only
consistent
with
its
history
and
language
but
that
it
will
strike
an
appropriate
balance
between
maintaining
the
efficiency
and
integrity
of
the
litigation
process
while
no
overly
deterring
resort
to
that
process
and
will
as
well
strike
an
appropriate
balance
between
the
different
roles
and
responsibilities
of
counsel
and
of
representative
parties.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
that
we
would
suggest,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
we
believe--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--no,
i
think
the
rule
itself
is
actually
silent
on
this
particular
point.
having
in
mind
what
this
court
observed
in
pavelic
and
leflore,
a
recent
rule
11
case,
one
does
of
course
begin
with
the
language
of
the
rule.
but
in
this
case
i
believe
that
language
does
not
help
us
or,
at
least
in
an
dispositive
way,
permit
us
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i'm
not
sure,
justice
o'connor,
whether
you're
speaking
now
to
the
text
of
the
rule
or
to
how
this
court
as
a
matter
policy
ought
to
interpret
it.
if
you
were
speaking
to
the
text
of
the
rule,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
a
parsing
of
its
language
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
we
are
not
in
fact
given
the
answer
to
that
question.
and
indeed,
if
you
refer
to
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
the
rules,
they
are
quite
clear
in
saying
that
it
is
the
signature
of
the
attorney
that
violates
the
rule.
it
then
goes
on
in
the
same
sentence
to
say
although
it
may
be
appropriate,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
also
to
impose
the
sanction
upon
the
client.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
believe
it
refers
to
a
party,
mr.
chief
justice,
only
in
the
context
of
a
pro
se
party.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
no,
but
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
rule
in
its
total
context
you
will
see
that
the
reference
above
to
a
signer
is
only
to
a
pro
se
party.
i
believe
that
the
second
sentence
of
the
rule--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--i'm
sorry.
we
certainly
didn't--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--yes.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
you're
surely
right,
both
as
to
what
the
rule
says
and
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
put
that
sentence
in.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
but
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
fact
if
you
think
about
the
way
in
which
the
process
operates
in
the
federal
courts,
pleadings,
motions,
and
other
papers
are
not
signed
by
parties
at
all,
with
the
single
exception
of
affidavits.
we
do
not
indeed
require
a
verification.
in
fact,
the
rule
specifically
so
provides.
so
i
think
that
it
would
be
straining
the
context
of
the
rule
to
suggest
that
although
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
rule
had
said
"or
pro
se
party",
i
don't
believe
that
the
rule
can
fairly
be
read
to
say
that
a
party
is
under
the
obligation
that
is
the
same
as
a--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--yes.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
do
concede
that.
and
in
fact
affidavits,
at
least
in
the
context
of
a
summary
judgment
motion,
are
specifically
dealt
with
by
rule
56(g).
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
no,
although
i
must
say
i
cannot
understand
why
the
policy
would
be
any
different
for
an
affidavit
in
support
of
an
injunction
on
the
one
hand
or
an
affidavit
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
although
again,
if
one
looks
to
the
advisory
committee
note,
you
will
find
a
reference
to
the
fact...
i
think
it's
the
very
conclusion
of
those
notes...
that
rule
11
literally
read
would
apply
as
well
to
discovery
motions,
although
the
advisory
committee
suggested
that
it
was
not
intended
to
and
rather
that
one
should
look
to
a
different
rule.
so
by
its
literal
terms
this
rule
does
apply
to
an
affidavit
not
submitted
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
indeed,
i
suppose
it
literally
applies
even
to
a
motion
submitted
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
opposing
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
i
think
it
would
difficult
to
square
an
application
of
a
negligence
standard
to
such
a
summary
judgment
affidavit
in
the
face
of
the
explicit
language
of
rule
56(g)
which
indicates
that
it
is
only
affidavits
submitted
in
effect
for
bad
faith
or
an
improper
purpose.
that
ought
to
be
so
sanctioned.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
would
think
that
is
correct.
yes.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i'm
not...
no,
i
don't
think
we
have
argued
that
here.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
we
need
to
argue
that
in
order
to
prevail.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
believe
there
can
be
a
rule
11
violation
by
the
client
and
not
by
the
attorney.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
we
don't,
justice
kennedy,
and
i'm
not
sure
why
that
would
necessarily
follow.
it
seems
to
me
there
can
be
circumstances--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--well,
it
is
certainly
the
purpose
of
rule
11,
as
the
first
sentence
of
the
advisory
committee
notes
say,
to
control
abuses
in
the
signing
of
pleadings,
which
ordinarily
will
be
by
counsel.
but
i
think
you
can...
one
can
readily
envision
a
situation
in
which
the
client,
set
on
some
illicit
purpose,
misleads
his
or
her
counsel
and
thereby
commits
a
violation
of
rule
11.
in
those
circumstances
i
see
no
reason
why
although
counsel
becomes
the
agent
through
which
the
violation
occurs,
just
as
the
advisory
committee
notes
say,
i
see
no
reason
why
it
would
not
be
entirely
appropriate
to
sanction
the
client
rather
than
instead
of
in
addition
to
counsel
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
that
would
be
a
relatively
unusual
circumstance,
but
i
think
the
rule
specifically
provides
that
can
be
done,
and
i
think
that
the
hypothetical
i've
suggested
is
not
unreasonable
situation.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
think...
i
hope
not.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
to...
in
rule
11
surely
covers
situations
in
which
malicious
prosecution
or
abuse
of
process
actions
could
be
brought.
one
of
our
concerns
is
that
as
interpreted
by
the
ninth
circuit
it
would
appear
to
go
beyond
that
and
permit
a
client
to
be
punished
by
the
payment
of
fees,
and
hereby
the
dismissal
of
its
action,
even
where
a
malicious
prosecution
or
an
abusive
process
action
could
not
be
brought.
and
we
do
have
some
question
about
the
propriety
of
that.
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
inhibition
upon
the
rule
establishing
such
a
rule
11
tort
as
we've
called
it
in
our
brief,
because
i
believe
that
the
rule,
properly
interpreted,
simply
doesn't
reach
that
issue.
and
i
believe
that
if
one
accepts
my
view
of
the
language
of
the
rule,
as
leading
us
in
effect
agnostic
as
to
this
particular
question,
then
what
one
needs
to
do
is
to
turn
to
the
purpose
of
the
rule
which,
justice
o'connor,
you
observed
both
in
your
question
to
me
and
in
your
opinion
in
cooter
&
gell
is
deterrence.
but
if
i
may,
in
that
very
opinion,
in
the
same
paragraph
in
which
you
announced
that
deterrence
is
the
central
purpose
of
rule
11,
you
also
made
clear
to
caveat
the
fact
that
it
must
read
with
two
other
concerns
in
mind.
first
of
all
that
it
will
lead
to
satellite
litigation,
something
that
the
bar
is
very
concerned
with
and
which
we
think
is
implicated
by
this
case.
and
second,
that
it
will
tend
to
chill
the
enthusiasm
or
willingness,
if
you
will,
of
clients
to
be
willing
to
bring
litigation
if
they
are
concerned
that
their
carelessness
in
the
best
of
faith;
their
mistakes
as
in
this
case,
will
lead
them
to
be
sanctioned
by
a
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
one
asks
about
deterrence,
one
is
not
asking
a
question
either
about
an
absolute
nor
are
you
asking
a
question
in
a
vacuum.
rather
it
seems
that
deterrence
first
of
all
can
be
perfectly
properly
achieved
by
reading
rule
11
as
we
would
have
it
read,
that
is,
to
apply
to
counsel
who
are
professionals
after
all.
we
do
expect
of
counsel
competence
as
well
as
good
faith.
and
indeed
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
rule
was
amended
in
1983
precisely
to
make
that
point
explicit
and
to
make
the
rule
more
robust
when
it
came
to
counsel.
but
just
as
we
expect
certain
things
from
our
counsel,
also
we
expect
and
tolerate
certain
things
from
parties.
we
certainly
expect
them
not
to
proceed
in
bad
faith.
we
do
not
expect
them
to
harass,
to
use
litigation,
to
impose
costs
or
delays
upon
opposing
parties,
and
that
is
surely
a
properly
subject
for
the
sanctioning
of
a
party
who
engages
in
that
kind
of
behavior.
at
the
same
time
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
we
either
should
nor
need
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
rule
impose
a
sanction
upon
a
client
who
is
proceeding
after
all
in
good
faith,
who
wishes
to
prevail
in
its
case.
it
avails
such
a
party
nothing
to
file
a
law
suit
based
upon
a
mistake.
if
a
mistake
in
fact
is
so
obvious
that
a
reasonable
investigation
would
promptly
reveal
it,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
mistake
will
be
very
quickly
revealed
as
well
to
the
court.
and
at
that
point
the
client
will
have
expended
his
or
her
resources
in
vain.
i
see--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
souter,
of
the
13,000,
although
i
don't
have
a
specific
breakdown,
most
of
it
was
expended
actually
in
pursuing
the
sanctions.
almost
nothing
happened
in
this
litigation
itself.
indeed,
there
was
never
an
appearance
at
all
by
chromatics,
the
defendant,
until
after
the
sanctions
proceedings
and
all
three
of
the
hearings
and
the
magistrate's
recommendations
had
already
been
made.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
if
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
been
heard
on
its
merits,
there
would
have
been
an
opportunity
for
counsel
to
appear
and
oppose.
actually,
they
would
have
appeared
and
opposed
in
response
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
but
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
never
even
issued.
when
the
judge's
law
clerk
discovered
that
there
were
errors,
it
was
at
that
point
before
chromatics
had
ever
filed
a
piece
of
paper,
if
my
recollection
serves,
that
the
case
was
brought
to
a
halt
and
the
sanction
proceedings
began.
but
i
think...
i'm
a
little
bit
unfair
to
your
question
if
i
suggest
that
because
in
this
case
that
occurred
that
there
may
not
be
circumstances
in
which
people
will
incur
expenses
as
the
result
of
a
mistake.
the
answer
is
they
will,
whether
this
is
a
good
illustration
of
that
or
not.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
you
are.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
quite
agree.
and,
and
i
think
that
the
distinction
that
i
am
drawing
is
between
those
persons
who
manage
the
litigation,
that
is,
attorneys
or
pro
se
parties
and
that
when
somebody
comes
forth
to
attempt
to
explain
the
facts
whether
on
a
witness
stand
or
here
in
it
equivalent...
i
mean,
one
could
envision
a
tro
hearing
with
a
witness
appearing,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
there
we
would
have
a
rule
of
absolutely
immunity.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
policies
which
lead
the
court
to
that
kind
of
rule
as
to
witnesses
certainly
are
instructive
when
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
we
are
prepared--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
no,
we...
in
fact
we
would
have
a
policy
that
would
be
very
strongly
against
that.
but
because
of
the
policy
that
we
do
have
of
not
chilling
the
adversary
function,
we
are
willing
to
tolerate
perjured
testimony
by--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--no,
there
is
a
remedy
in
the
form
of
criminal
sanctions,
albeit
there
for
intentional
misconduct.
and
i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--so
do
i.
and
indeed
if
we
having
lying
in
this
case,
we
would
say
that
rule
11
should
apply.
there
is
no
question.
i
merely
cite
the
decision
in
briscoe
against
lahue
in
order
to
indicate.
because
the
court
did
explain
the
reason
for
the
decision
in
that
case
as
being
based
in
large
part
upon
this
policy
of
not
chilling
advocacy,
a
policy
which
is
then
echoed
in
the
course
of
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
cooter
&
gell.
now,
we
draw
this
line
between
intentional
misconduct
and
negligent
misconduct
rather
frequently.
it's
drawn
sometimes
as
a
statutory
matter,
as
in
1927.
it's
been
drawn
by
this
court
in
terms
of
the
inherent
power
which
the
judiciary
has
to
sanction
misconduct.
it's
been
drawn
in
the
course
of
interpreting
rule
10(b)(5)
in
hochfelder.
we
do
it
for
all
sorts
of
reasons,
and
we
suggest
that
it
ought
to
be
done
here
for
even
stronger
reasons.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
very
much
threatened
by
a
party's
innocent
errors.
innocent
errors
do
happen
all
the
time.
witnesses
are
on
the
stand
in
courts
all
the
time,
and
they
testify
on
direct
examination
with
a
great
deal
of
certainty
about
the
contents
of
a
critical
meeting
only
to
be
met
on
cross-examination
by
a
memorandum
that
they
had
written
a
year
earlier--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--yes,
there
are
two.
the
first
is
the
filing
of
the
initial
tro
application
itself.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
which
was
signed
by
the
attorney,
although
as,
as
it
turned
out
there
was
a
signature
never
referred
to
in
any
of
the
proceedings
below.
but
there
was
in
fact
unneedless
verification
submitted
by
the
president
of
the
corporation.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
and
then
second
was
the
supplemental
declaration
and
papers
accompanying
it,
signed
by
mr.
lamb,
who
was
an
employee
of--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--that's
the
affidavit
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
a
verification
is
always
an
individual,
but
the
form
of
verification
that
is
used
in
federal
court
where
you
have
a
corporate
party
does
not
state
and
is
not
required
to
state
that
i
know
the
facts
to
be
true,
because
that
would
be
very
difficult
in
many
cases.
it
states
rather
that
i
am
informed
and
believe
that
the
information
is
correct.
and--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--it's
may
recollection
that
it
was
signed...
i'm
wrong.
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix
says
that,
"i,
j.
roger
friedman,
president
of
business
guides,
being
first
duly
sworn
say
that
the
foregoing
complaint
is
true

correct.

mr.

--by

mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--yes,
although
that--
mr.
stephen
v.

--that

it
refers
to
that,
although
i
must--
mr.

no.

mr.

it
could
not
be.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
of
course.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
need
to
do
or
ought
to
do
in
interpreting
rule
11--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--of
course.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
no,
it
was
for
both.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
it
was
for
both.
we
submit
that
the
nature
of
the
obligation
imposed
by
rule
11
should
be
related
to
the
harm
that
we
are
trying
to
rectify
and
the
problems
we
foresee.
we
suggest
that
for
the
lawyer
that
problem
is
not
making
sure
that
a
claim
is
well
grounded
as
well
proceeding
for
an
improper
purpose.
however,
for
a
client
we
suggest
it
is
simply
the
misuse
of
the
process.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
reading
of
the
rule
is
both
narrower
and
broader
than
that
suggested
by
opposing
counsel
and
indeed
by
some
of
the
court's
questions.
i
believe
that
the
language
of
the
second
sentence
of
the
rule,
which
in
an
attempt
to
redeem
myself,
justice
scalia,
we
did
cite
at...
in
our
discussion
of
the
language
at
page
4
of
our
reply
brief,
that
the
language
of
the
rule
makes
clear
that
it
is
intended
to
apply
when
it
uses
the
term
"or
party
to
a
pro
se
party.
"
beyond
that,
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
which
will
be
the
situation
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
and
i
realize
this
court
sits
to
decided
cases
or
controversies,
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
rule
11
cases,
the
courts
are
going
to
be
confronted
with
cases
in
which
the
represented
party
has
signed
nothing.
thus,
the
rule
which
talks
later
about
a
represented
party
being
sanctioned
would
not
under
the
literal
interpretation,
which
only
would
permit
sanctions
against
a
signer,
have
any
application
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
it
is
precisely
what
i'm
trying...
trying
to
do,
justice
stevens.
i
am
suggesting
that
that
sentence
is
there
to
tell
the
district
court
that
in
an
appropriate
circumstance
somebody
who
did
not
sign,
namely
a
represented
party,
may
be
sanctioned.
and
indeed
that
is
precisely
what
the
rules
advisory
committee
said.
let
me
read,
"even
though
it
is
the
attorney
whose
signature
violates
the
rule,
it
may
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstance
of
the
case
to
impose
a
sanction
on
the
client.
"
i
believe
this
rule
can
be
read
in
an
integrated,
sensible
fashion
and
i
believe
we
are
left
when
we
do
that
with
the
question
of
what
rule
is
it
that
will
best
accommodate
the
competing
policy
considerations.
on
the
one
hand,
the
desire
to
deter
the
filing
of
frivolous
litigation.
sanctioning
an
attorney
who
does
not
make
a
reasonable
inquiry
will
do
that.
the
only
reason
that
the
sanction
cannot
be
collected
in
this
particular
case
is
the
unfortunate
circumstance
that
business
guides'
attorneys
are
in
bankruptcy,
although
following
pavelic
and
leflore,
they
could
have
sued...
and
should
indeed
have
only
sued...
the
individual
attorneys.
so
there
is
not
a
situation
where
my
interpretation
will
leave
parties
who
incur
expenses
without
a
remedy.
they
will
have
that
remedy
against
counsel.
as
to
the
parties,
we
need
not
for
any
purpose
of
deterrence,
have
a
rule
which
deters
the
useless
of
filing
a
law
suit
which
they
believed
to
be
legitimate
but
is
not
in
fact
because
that
will
readily
be
revealed.
it
will,
on
the
other
hand,
chill
the
expression
of
people
who
are
concerned
that
a
judge
may
someday
view
their
actions
as
objectionably
unreasonable.
a
subjective
standard
of
bad
faith
is
easy
for
a
client
to
know
about.
and
clients
come
in
all
shapes,
sizes,
and
degrees
of
intelligence.
i
think
we
should
not
permit
them
to
be
sanctioned
under
those
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
rule
makes
sense
only
when
as
the
economist
would
say,
ex
ante,
it
provides
adequate
guidance.
i
suggest
that
the
rule
we
propose
does
that.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
only
when
you're
going
behind
the
lawyer.
the
rule
i
think
is
quite
clear.
if
you
are
a
pro
se
party,
you
have
elected,
perhaps
unwisely,
to
take
on
those
burdens.
and
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
what
the
rule
has
in
mind.
but
i
think
that
the
rule
plainly
applies
as
we
suggest.
