without
being
in

justice
byron

white
suppose
the
dancers
complied
with
the
statute,
and...
would
you
say
that
then
the
dancing
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
if
they
complied
with
the
statute
and
still
danced,
they
would
not
be
dancing
nude.
in
that
event,
would
the
dancing
be
protected?
i
would
suppose
you
would
say
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
first
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
first...
i
thought...
the
dancing
wouldn't...
clothed
or
unclothed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
wouldn't...
the
message
would
not
change
or
the
lack
of
it
wouldn't
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
might
not
be
able
to
prohibit
under
some
other
provision
in
the
constitution.
you
just
say
it
wouldn't
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron

song
and
dance.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose...
you
say
that
even
if
dancing
nude
might
communicate
a
different
message
than
complying
with
the
statute,
these
particular
dancers
have
never
claimed
or
indicated
that
they
were...
had
any
such
message
to
deliver
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
children
barred
from
all
these
places?
justice
white
well,
even
objectively
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
any
fool
would
say
that
there
was
a
performance
dance
here,
because
there
was
dancing
in
front
of
people.
justice
white
whether
they
intended
to
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
difference
between
that
kind
of
dancing
and
the
dancing
in
this
case
based
on
the
effect
on
the
audience,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
awhile
ago
you
were
talking
about
the
effect
on
the
audience.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
any
difference
between,
say,
opera
and
the
dancing
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
the
audience?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
were
just
talking
about
its
idea
of
the
artistic
value
rather
than
the
effect
on
the
audience.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
there
are
some
things
the
state
can
prohibit
even
if...
just
because
it
has
an
effect
on
the
audience.
what
about
shouting
fire
in
a
crowded
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
recited
that
the
state
thought
that
nude
dancing
would
have
some
unsatisfactory
on
the
audience
and
you
say
that's
not
permissible
because
that
means
it's
really
expressive.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
fire?
a
fire
in
a
theater?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
depends
exactly
on
what
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
depends
exactly
on
what
you
said.
you
said,
fire,
rather
than
no
fire.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
could
leave...
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
your
first
argument,
i
suppose,
we'd
just
leave
those
other
issues
open?
