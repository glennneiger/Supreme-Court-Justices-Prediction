if
we
were
to
find
that
an
emotional
communication
as
opposed
to
a
particularized
message
were
protectable,
what
would
you
then
say
to
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
they
simply
cannot
communicate
the
message
in
any
other
way
except
by
nude
dancing?
i
think
what
they're
saying
in
effect
is
that
some
kind
of
a
medium-is-the-message
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
they
cannot
define
their
activity
by
saying
the
medium
and
the
message
are
identical
and
thereby
evade
the
possibility
of
otherwise
permissible
first
amendment
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
defining
the
larger
form
of
expression
by
particularized
message?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
the
particularized
message
distinction
is
not
upheld,
then
you
have
no
way
of
drawing
the
line
between
the
higher
and
lower
form.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
uhl,
i'm
sorry
to
get
out
of
sequence
here,
but
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
a
baysinger
point,
lest
i
forget
it.
and
it's
a
question
about
the
significance
of
baysinger
in
relation
to
what
this
court
may
hold.
if
we
do
not
sustain
a
distinction
based
on
particularized
message,
so
that
we
were
to
hold
that
the
communication
of
some
emotional
content
were
sufficient
to
qualify
for
first
amendment
scrutiny,
would
the
effect
of
baysinger
be
that
this
conduct
would
be
allowed
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
baysinger
would
still
be
a
tautology
as
you
put
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
