justice

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-26,
michael
barnes
v.
glen
theatre,
inc.--
mr.
uhl.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
uhl,
are
you
conceding
that
if
conduct
does
communicate,
then
it
can't
be
regulated
at
all
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
o'brien
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
they
call
this
place
a
bookstore?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
uhl.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ennis,
would
you
concede
that
a
state
ban
on
nudity
on
public
thoroughfares
and
sidewalks
is
constitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
they
regulate
it
by
prohibiting
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
vice
in
this
statute
as
applied
is
that
it
takes
it
off
the
sidewalks
and
thoroughfares
and
regulates
activity
in
a
private--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if
your
client
had
decided
to
perform
a
dance...
this
same
dance...
in
a
public
park
in
indiana?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
here,
mr.
ennis,
isn't
addressed
to
dancing
at
all.
it's
addressed
to
public
nudity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
dancer
wanted
to
do
kind
of
an
annie
oakley
dance
in
the
course
of
which
she
fired
off
a
revolver
at
various
targets
around
the
room--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
the
state
says
that's
a
violation
of
our
law.
you
can't
fire
a
revolver
without
a
permit.
you
can't
do
it
in
this
kind
of
a
place.
and
the
dancer
says,
well,
i
can't
really
get
across
the
annie
oakley
message
without
firing
off
the
gun.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
then
says,
well,
we
have
real
fears
that
if
you
do
it
in
a
crowded
adult
bookstore
you
might
hurt
somebody.
that's
certainly
is
talking
about
the
application
right
there
to
the
bookstore.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
the
state's
interest
in
banning
public
nudity
unrelated
to
expressive
activity?
it
doesn't
care
whether
expression
takes
place
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
let's
assume
that
the
state
has
said
hypothetically,
we
don't
care
what
are
the
audiences'
reactions.
we
just
don't
think
public
nudity
anywhere
is
a
good
idea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
state
didn't
advance
quite
the
right
justification
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
we
to
accept--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ennis,
the
second
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
if
nude
dancing
is
speech
whether
indiana's
general
public
indecent
laws
are
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
such
dancing.
that
surely
brings...
raises
the
justification
issues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
or
does
it
not
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i'm
going
to
look
at
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
raise
that
point
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
didn't
have
the
text
of
the
brief
before
you
at
the
time
you
filed
the
brief--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
might
have
been
a
consideration
to
be
brought
before
us
in
considering
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
you
know
our
rule
and
in
our
oklahoma
city
against
tuttle,
anything
that's
nonjurisdictional
that
isn't
brought
up
in
the
brief
in
opposition
is
waived
by
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
think
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
sketchy,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
mr.
uhl,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
uhl.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.90-26,
barnes
versus
glen
theater,
inc
at
el.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
are
two
indiana
establishments
who
wish
to
provide
totally
nude
dancing
as
entertainment
and
also
individual
dancers
employed
there.
they
sued
to
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
indiana's
public
indecency
statute
which
prohibits
nudity
in
public
places.
the
law
requires
the
dancers
to
wear
at
least
pasties
and
a
g-string.
respondents
assert
that
this
law
violated
the
first
amendment
by
infringing
their
freedom
of
expression.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
with
them.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
which
i
have
written,
which
justices
o'connor
and
kennedy
have
joined,
we
conclude
that
although
nude
dancing
of
its
kind
thought
to
be
performed
here
is
expressive
conduct
within
the
outer
perimeters
of
the
first
amendment.
the
enforcement
of
indiana's
public
indecency
law
to
prevent
totally
nude
dancing,
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment's
guarantee
of
freedom
of
expression.
the
indiana's
statute
follows
a
long
line
of
state
laws
banning
public
nudity
and
reflects
moral
disapproval
of
people
appearing
in
the
nude
among
strangers
in
public
places.
this
governmental
interest
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression
since
public
nudity
is
the
evil
the
state
seeks
to
prevent
whether
or
not
it
is
combined
with
expressive
activity.
the
law
does
not
ban
nudity
in
these
establishments
because
the
dancers
are
conveying
an
erotic
message.
to
the
contrary,
an
erotic
performance
may
be
presented
without
any
state
interference
so
long
as
the
performers
wear
a
scant
amount
of
clothing.
we
think
the
incidental
restriction
on
first
amendment
freedom
is
no
greater
than
it's
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
the
government
interest.
justices
scalia
and
souter
have
each
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall,
blackmun,
and
stevens
have
joined.
