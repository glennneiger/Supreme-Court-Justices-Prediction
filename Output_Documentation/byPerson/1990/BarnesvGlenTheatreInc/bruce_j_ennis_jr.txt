mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
nude
dancing
is
sufficiently
expressive
to
at
least
trigger
first
amendment
analysis
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
nude
dancing
is
expressive,
because
performance
dance
is
inherently
expressive
of
emotions
and
ideas,
and
second,
because
nude
dancing
communicates
a
particularized
message
of
sensuality
and
eroticism.
first,
performance
dance,
like
music,
is
one
of
the
oldest
forms
of
human
communication
and
is
inherently
expressive
of
emotions
and
ideas.
in
ward,
this
court
found
that
music
is
expressive
without
bothering
to
determine
whether
the
music
at
issue
did
or
did
not
communicate
a
particularized
message.
a
particularized
message
test
applies
only
to
conduct
that
is
not
ordinarily
expressive,
such
as
flag
burning.
even
that
kind
of
conduct
can
be
found
expressive
if
in
context
it
communicates
a
particularized
message.
but
the
court
has
never
used
that
test
to
determine
whether
marching
or
picketing
or
other
traditionally
considered
expressive
forms
of
activity
are
expressive
or
not.
the
court's
decisions
made
clear
that
if
expressive...
if
conduct
is
otherwise
expressive
and
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
the
fact
that
the
conduct
involves
nudity
does
not
shed
that
protection.
for
example,
in--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
it
would
trigger
first
amendment
analysis
if
it's
intended
to
be
expressive,
but
the
state
probably
could
regulate
it
because
of
the
captive
audience--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--they
could
probably
prohibit
it
because
of
the
captive
audience
problem
or
exposure
to
children,
just
as
in
sable
the
court
said
that
although
indecent
speech
is
constitutionally
protected,
it
can
nevertheless
be...
regulated.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
it
is
effectively
a
private
place.
it's
called
a
public
place,
but
it's
a
private
building
on
private
property
that
is
enclosed.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
the
state
could
prohibit
that,
because
of
the
concerns
as
in
sable
of
a
captive
audience
being
forced
to
see
a
message
they
do
not
want
to
see
or
the
possibility
of
children
being
present.
but
what
sable
makes
clear
is
the
state,
in
order
to
serve
those
interests,
cannot
categorically
ban
access
to
such
speech
by
consenting
adults,
and
that's
all
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely.
there's
no
dispute.
that's
stipulated
that
this
was
only
consenting
adults.
id's
are
checked
at
the
door.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
performance
dance.
by
that
i
mean
dance
which
is
intended
as
a
performance
in
front
of
an
audience,
to
distinguish
that
from
recreational
dance
or
dancing
at
home
in
your
own
room.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
would...
if
it
was
intended
as
expressive
activity,
if
it
was
performance
dance.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
trigger
first
amendment
analysis.
whether
the
state
could
ban
it
or
not
would
depend
on
the
state's
justifications.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--what
is
performance
dance
is
a
question
in
this
case.
the
main
way
that
that
is
answered,
if
you'll
look
at
the
material
cited
in
the
briefs,
encyclopedia
britannica
and
others,
is
where
there
is
an
intention
to
perform
in
front
of
an
audience
through
dancing.
that...
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact,
and
that
was
not
disputed
here,
that
all
of
these
respondents
did
intend
to
dance
as
communication
and
as
expression.
that's
a
factual
finding
that's
not
at
issue.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
your
honor,
but
they
did
intend
to.
gayle
sutro's
affidavit,
for
example,
states
that
she
is
actually
a
professional
dancer
who
has
gone
to
a
recognized
dance
academy,
has
a
degree
in
both
ballet
and
erotic
dance.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me
turn
directly
to
that,
justice
scalia.
that
depends
on
the
state's
justifications,
assuming
this
is
expressive
activity.
this
statute
cannot--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it
does--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--if
someone
uses
peyote
or
commits
a
murder
for
the
purpose
of
committing...
communicating
or
expressive
activity,
that
would
trigger
first
amendment
analysis.
but
the
state
could
nevertheless
prohibit
it.
and
here's
why,
your
honor.
this
statute
is
not
content
neutral
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
the
application
of
this
statute
to
nude
dancing
is
related
to
expression
within
the
meaning
o'brien,
and
second,
the
statute
as
construed
in
baysinger
exempts
other
expressive
activity
precisely
because
of
its
artistic
or
expressive
content
or
value
and
thus
under
mosley
and
raglan
cannot
be
deemed
a
content-based
statute.
first.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
statute
in
o'brien
was
not...
the
statute
in
many
of
the
cases,
like
the
flag-burning
cases,
was
not
addressed
to
expressive
activity
on
its
face.
it
was
expressed
only
to
the
conduct
of
burning
or
mutilating
the
flag.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
the
court's
opinion
in
o'brien
and
all
the
flag-burning
cases
uses
the
same
analysis.
it
says
the
state
must
justify
the
application
of
an
otherwise
content-neutral
statute
to
expressive
activity
for
reasons
unrelated
to
expression.
in
this
case,
you
can
look
at
the
state's
briefs.
the
state
has
acknowledged
its
fear
that
nude
dancing
is,
quote,
"likely
to
inspire
patriots
to
solicit
sex
from
performers
or
contemplate
rape
or
adultery.
"
the
state
has
admitted
it
has
concerns
about
the
effect
of
nude
dancing
on
attitudes
toward
women
and
has
argued
that
it
should
be
free
to
ban
nude
dancing
because
it,
quote,
"encourages
activities
which
break
down
family
structure
and
advocates
adultery,
licentiousness,
prostitution,
and
crime.
"
as
justice...
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
the
boos
v.
barry
makes
clear
these
justifications
are
related
to
expression
because
they
focus
on
the
direct
impact
of
speech
on
its
audience
and
they
are
concerned
with
listeners'
reactions.
therefore,
this
cannot
be
considered
a
content-neutral
statute,
and
that's
why
it
is
distinguished
from
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--but
it
does
not
depend
upon
the
listeners'
reactions
to
the
speech.
that's
like
setting
a
fire,
perhaps
burning
a
flag
in
an
enclosed
public
building
might
be
bannable
because
of
the
state's
independent
interest
in
fire
safety.
it
is
unrelated
to
expression.
the
state,
as
in
o'brien,
has
an
interest
in
applying
that
statute
to
this
expressive
activity
that
is
completely
unrelated
to
the
expressive
activity.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
state
has
told
us
that
it
does
care.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
state
has
told
what
its
reasons--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
that
is--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
that's
not
my
position,
justice
rehnquist.
there
are
two
reasons
why
this
is
a
content-based
statute.
the
first
is
the
state
did
advance
reasons,
and
the
reasons
it
advances
are
related
to
expression.
the
second
though,
is
the
baysinger
construction
point.
in
baysinger
the
indiana
supreme
court
construed
this
statute
so
that
it
would
permit
some
nude
dancing
in
public
and
prohibit
other
nude
dancing
in
public
based
solely
on
the
state's
subjective
determination
of
whether
that
nude
dancing
had
sufficient
expressive
value
or
artistic
content.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
the
noise
point,
for
example,
in
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
ward,
the
court
found
that
controlling
volume
there
was
unrelated
to
the
expression
because
it
applied...
no
matter
who
was
expressing
the
message
and
regardless
of
the
state's
agreement
or
disagreement
with
the
views
or
the
listeners'
reaction
to
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
you
can't
say
that
here
certainly
after
the
baysinger
construction,
because
the
court
in
baysinger
makes
clear
that
some
nude
dancing
is
permitted
and
others
is
prohibited
based
on
the
state's
evaluation
of
its
expressive
value
or
artistic
merit.
that's
exactly
what
the
state
has
argued
over
and
over
again
before
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
white,
i
did
not
understand
that
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
state
seems
to
feel
there
is.
the
state
seems
to
feel--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
state
seems
to
feel
that
if
nude
dancing
is
artistic,
it
has
one
effect
on
the
audience
and
does
not
incite
the
audience
to
prostitution,
rape,
or
adultery,
but
that
if
nude
dancing
is
not
artistic,
it
does
have
that
effect
on
the
audience.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
certainly
some
categorical
exceptions
to
otherwise
first
amendment
protections
that
the
state
could
argue
here.
they
have
not.
that
state's
justifications
here...
they've
said
over
and
over
again
in
their
briefs,
and
in
fact
in
the
oral
argument--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it
means
that
it
is
a
content-based
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
fire
in
a
theater
has
an
effect
regardless
of
whether
the
listeners
agree
or
disagree
with
the
message.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are...
the
distinction
is
that
there
what
the
state
is
concerned
about
is
that
the
consenting
adults
in
the
audience
will
agree
with
this
message,
will
follow
what
they
take
the
message
to
be
and
will
go
out
and
have
bad
attitudes
about
women
or
commit
prostitution,
rape,
or
adultery.
it
depends
upon
the
state...
the
listeners'
reactions
of
being
persuaded
by
the
message
that
the
state
wants
to
suppress.
that
is
not
true
in
the
shouting-fire-in-the-theater
context.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
people
in
the
theater
think
there's
really
a
fire
or
not.
there's
a
stampede
and
people
get
hurt.
that's
a
very
different
case.
now,
i
think
that
mosley
and
raglan,
which
were
the
type
of
cases...
the
statutes
discussed
earlier
make
very
clear
that
if
a
statute
on
its
face
or
as
construed
exempts
some
expressive
activity
because
of
its
content,
then
that
statute
must
be
deemed
a
content-based
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
the
opinion
has
the
language
you
discussed
and
no
more.
the
way
the
state
has
described
baysinger
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
also
here
is
that
what
baysinger
did
was
to
say
that
nude
dancing
that
has
artistic
content
is--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--not
within
the
statute
and
nude
dancing
without
artistic
content
is.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
they
should
not,
but
that
is
the
state's
justification
for
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
certainly
for
purposes
of
this
case
the
attorney
general
has
represented
what
the
state's
interests
are,
whether
accurately
or
inaccurately.
those
are
the
state's
interests
for
purposes
of
this
case.
and
they...
if
you
look
at
pages
10,
24
through
25
of
the
state's
brief,
they
say
over
and
over
again
that
what
baysinger
means
is
that
if
the
dancing
is
artistic
it's
not
covered
by
the
statute.
if
it's
not
artistic,
it
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
in
its
oral
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
state
repeated
this
point
over
and
over
again.
now,
that
brings
me
to
another
point,
and
that
is
we've
been
talking
about
whether
there
are
justifications
for
this
statute
or
not.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
has
waived
any
right
to
attempt
to
justify
application
of
this
statute
to
respondents'
dancing
if
this
court
determines
that
that
dancing
is
sufficiently
expressive
to
trigger
first
amendment
analysis.
all
through
the
seventh
circuit,
in
5
years
of
litigation,
two
levels
at
the
trial
court
and
two
levels
in
the
supreme
court,
the
state
never
once
attempted
to
justify
application
of
this
statute
on
the
ground
that
it's
a
neutral
statute
of
general
applicability
or
it's
content
neutral
or
renton
analysis...
none
of
those
justifications
whatsoever.
in
fact,
in
oral
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit,
mr.
uhl
stood
up
and
said,
we
don't
have
to
try
to
justify
this
statute
and
we're
not
going
to,
because
our
position
if
simply
that
this
dancing
doesn't
even
trigger
first
amendment
analysis.
even
in
its
cert.
petition
to
this
court,
the
court...
this
state
does
not
squarely
argue
that
this
statute
can
be
justified.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
court
could
rule
that
the
respondents'
dancing
is
sufficiently
expressive
to
trigger
first
amendment
analysis
and
then
rule
that,
as
judge
posner
concurring
and
judge
easterbrook
dissenting,
indicated
that
the
state
has
waived
any
justification
for
applying
that...
this
statute
to
these
respondents.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
it's
a
close
question,
your
honor,
to
be
quite
candid.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
if
you
look
at
their
brief--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
question
seems...
it's
ambiguous
in
my
mind.
it
could
be
construed
that
way
or
could
not.
my
main
point
is
that
all
the
way
through
the
seventh
circuit,
the
state
didn't
attempt
to
make
such
a
justification,
and
they
don't
in
the
content
of
their
brief.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
the
reason
it
was
not
raised
in
opposition
is
that
it
was
not
our
understanding
that
the
state
had
raised
that
point,
since
the
text
of
their
brief
does
not
argue...
renton
does
not
argue.
clark--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--excuse
me,
i
mean
the
text
of
the
cert.
petition.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
but
let
me
say
this
though
that
even
if
the
state
is
deemed
to
have
raised
that
issue
for
the
first
time
in
its
question
presented
in
the
cert.
petition,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
state
never
attempted
to
justify
this
statute
below.
it
is
the
state's
burden
to
justify
application
of
a
statute
to
expressive
activity.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
know
the
rule,
your
honor,
rule
15
of
this
court
says
that
the
court
has
discretion
to
deem
it
waived
if
it
is
not
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition.
and
court...
of
course
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
do
that.
it
would
also
have
discretion
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
say
the
issue
was
too
important
to
be
decided
on
such
a
sketchy
record
as
we
have
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
sketchy,
but
we
didn't
know
until
the
state's
main
brief
in
this
case
what
the
state
interests
are
to
justify
regulation
of
respondents'
nude
dancing.
they've
posited
now
their
interests.
they
are
content-based
interests,
because
they
depend
upon
the
impact
of
the
speech
on
the
audience.
let
me
turn
for
a
minute
to
a
point
that
the
state
did
not
raise
in
its
oral
argument
but
did
raise
in
its
main
brief
here:
their
argument
that
this
statute
can
really
be
justified
as
a
renton-type
statute,
aimed
only
at
secondary
effects.
i
think
that
that
argument
is
totally
inapplicable
here
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
ordinance
in
renton
by
its
terms
focused
only
on
secondary
effects
of
certain
specified
businesses
and
did
not
prohibit
or
criminalize
any
expressive
activity
whatsoever.
this
statute,
by
its
terms,
does
not
even
mention
secondary
effects,
has
nothing
to
do
with
businesses
of
any
type,
and
does
criminalize
and
prohibit
expressive
activity.
second,
controlling
secondary
effects
was
the
actual
purpose
in
renton.
here,
as
the
state
candidly
acknowledges
in
its
brief,
it
is
only
a
quote,
"possible
hypothetical
purpose".
in
renton,
it
was
clear
that
the
government
was
actually
concerned
with
secondary
effects
and
had
reviewed
studies
and
extensive
evidence
about
that
problem.
here
the
state
does
not
claim
that
the
legislature
was
actually
concerned
about
secondary
effects
or
reviewed
any
evidence,
and
in
fact,
it
is
highly
implausible
that
the
secondary
effects
associated
with
adult
businesses
was
a
problem
or
a
concern
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
1881.
furthermore,
although
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
has
been
before
the
indiana
supreme
court
on
numerous
occasions,
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
never
even
hinted
that
the
statute
aims
at
secondary
effects.
finally,
the
state's
briefs
here
make
crystal
clear
that
the
interests
the
state
is
advancing
focus
on
the
impact
of
this
speech
on
its
audience,
on
the
listeners'
reactions.
accordingly,
this
is
a
primary
effects
case,
not
a
secondary
effects
case.
one
point
i
think
is
worth
mentioning
is
that
even
if
this
decision
is
affirmed,
the
state
of
indiana
would
be
left
with
ample
authority
to
regulate
or
perhaps
prohibit
nude
dancing
in
a
constitutional
manner.
the
state
could
certainly
prohibit
all
obscene
dancing,
whether
in
public
or
in
private.
it
could...
the
state
could
certainly
prohibit
all
obscene
nude
dancing.
that
would
not
be
affected
by
affirmance
here.
that
state
could
certainly
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
prohibit
dancing
where
alcohol
is
served,
whether
the
dancers
are
nude
or
clothed.
the
state
could
certainly
regulate
nude
dancing
under
the
sable
analysis
in
truly
public
places
before
unconsenting
adults,
captive
audiences,
or
children.
and
finally,
if
secondary
effects
were
in
fact
a
problem,
the
state
under
renton
could
even
zone,
so
long
as
it
was
a
true
zoning
ordinance
and
was
not
a
prohibition
of
a
category
of
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
that's
what
this...
that's
what
is
implicit
in
the
court's
decisions
in
miller
and
sable.
miller
and
sable
go
to
great,
great
careful
links
of
attempting
to
decide
what
forms
of
sexual
conduct
the
state
can
prohibit
and
what
it
cannot.
this
is
in
effect
and
end
run
around
miller
and
sable,
because
the
state
has
conceded
that
this
nude
dancing
is
not
obscene.
as
jenkins
v.
georgia
and
other
cases
in
this
court
make
clear,
the
mere
fact
of
nudity
does
not
equate
with
obscenity.
but
here
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
is
without
meeting
the
detailed
requirements
of
the
miller
test
or
the
sable
test,
nonetheless
to
categorically
ban
and
eliminate
an
entire
category
of
speech.
this
is
very
different.
the
artistic
point
here
is
very
different
from
the
artistic
point
in
miller.
miller--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--right,
but
the
court's
opinion
in
miller
i
think
has
been
understood
to
apply
to
live
conduct
and
performance
as
well
as
to
literature.
in
miller,
the
third
prong
of
the
test,
of
course,
is
an
artistic
prong
test.
but
that
judgment
is
only
reached
once
the
court
has
already
found
that
the
speech
is
patently
offensive
and
appeals
to
a
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
is,
therefore,
otherwise
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
artistic
merit
test
in
miller
comes
into
save
and
give
protection
to
speech
that
is
otherwise
unprotected.
here,
the
state,
as
justice
kennedy's
question
suggests,
would
be
striking
out
on
very
new
ground
indeed.
here
the
state
would
be
saying
that
speech
is
only
protected
to
begin
with
if
it
has
artistic
merit.
as
this
court
said
in
hanaghan
unanimously,
what
to
one
man
is
trash
may
to
others
have
fleeting
or
even
enduring
values
and
it
is
not
business
of
the
state
to
determine
which
is
trash
and
which
is
valuable.
the
first
amendment
leaves
that
judgment
to
the
individual.
in
fact
as
justice
harlan
wrote
in
cohen
v.
california,
one
man's
lyric
is
another's
vulgarity.
and
as
justice
harlan
said,
it
is
precisely
because
governments
cannot
make
principal
decisions
between
those
kinds
of
communications,
that
the
first
amendment
leaves
judgments
in
matters
of
taste
to
the
individual.
thank
you
very
much.
