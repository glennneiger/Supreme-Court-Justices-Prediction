justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
evidently
sing
in
an
opera
without
his
clothes
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
seeing
an
opera?
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
of
what
indiana
law
is?
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
nudity
law
somehow
for
artistic
performances,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
includes
opera
but
not
go-go
dancing?
justice
scalia
is
there...
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
good-taste
clause
of
the
constitution?
how
does
one
draw
that
line
between
salome
and
the
kitty
cat
lounge?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
what
are
you
arguing
about
dance
for?
dance
was
not
prohibited
here,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
people
could
have
danced
to
their
heart's
content
so
long
as
they
had
clothes
on
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
dickens
wrote
his
books,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
sure
about
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
she
may
not
have
made
the
movie
only
to
make
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
should
have
jumped
in
earlier
i
guess.
i
wish
we
could
clarify
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
has
said
about
nude
dancing
in
the
course
of
the
theatrical
production,
because
that
does
bear
upon
whether
it's
content
neutral.
i
mean,
as
i
understand
the
law
in
indiana,
it
isn't
content
neutral.
you
can
dance
nude
but
only
in
certain...
i
don't
know...
high-toned
kinds
of
productions.
is
that
the
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
larger?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
you're
saying
that
they
don't
really
mean
it.
that
they're
just
saying,
we're
imposing
that
limitation
because
we
think
the
constitution
requires
that
limitation
and
if
the
constitution
doesn't,
then
there
isn't
even
that
limitation
on
the
statute.
is
that
your
interpretation
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis,
nobody
is
stopping
her
from
dancing.
suppose
you
win
this
point:
dancing
is
expression.
they
have
not
stopped
her
from
dancing.
they
have
stopped
her
from
going
about
nude,
whether
dancing
or
doing
anything
else,
just
as
i
suppose
they
have
murder
laws
in
indiana
which
prevent
people
from
killing
people,
whether
in
the
course
of
dancing
or
not.
now,
would
one
have
to
analyze
the
indiana
murder
law
as
a...
as
valid
or
invalid
under
first
amendment
if
the
murder
happens
to
be
performed
in
the
course
of
a
public
performance
dance?
would
we
have
to
consider
that
a
first
amendment
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
to
my
last
question
is
yes,
it
does
turn
on
the
state's
justifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
first
amendment
case,
if
you
kill
somebody
in
the
course
of
dancing.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
equivalent
here
would
be
addressing
it
to
dancing.
in
the
flag-burning
case,
the
equivalent
to
what
happened
here
would
be
a
statute
that
banned
burning
anything
in
the
street,
a
flag
or
anything
else.
and
then
people
would
have
come
in
and
said,
well,
you
know,
it's
a
ban
on
expression,
because
what
i
wanted
to
burn
was
a
flag,
and
i
think
we
would
have
said
in
the
flag
case...
in
fact
i
think
we
did
say
in
dictum
that
if
it
was
that
kind
of
a
statute
it
would
be
a
totally
different
question.
and
it's
that
kind
of
a
statute
you
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
nude
dancing.
it's
not
dancing.
it's
nudity,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis,
what
language...
i've
been
looking
at
baysinger...
and
i...
it
really
does
seem
to
me
that
all
the
indiana
court
is
saying
is
responding
to
an
overbreadth
argument.
the
argument
was
that
this
statute
would
cover
such
things
as
the
play,
hair,
which
can't
constitutionally
be
covered
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
just
seemed
to
say,
well,
if
it
can't
constitutionally
be
covered,
it's
not
covered
by
the
statute.
and
you
read
that
as
a
discrimination
by
the
state
on
the
basis
of
subject
matter?
i...
unless
there's
more
explicit
language
in
that
opinion
that
i
don't
see.
that's
all
that
i
read
into
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
shouldn't
have
described
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we
are
dealing
with
an
indiana
supreme
court
opinion,
and
i
suppose
the
indiana
supreme
court
can
speak
for
itself
and
it's
not
governed
by
what
the
attorney
general
recharacterizes
it
as.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
subject
to
that
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation,
every
community
in
indiana
would
have
to
have
some
nude
dancing,
if
an
entrepreneur
wanted
to
provide
it.
you'd
have
to
set
aside
a
part
of
the
community
for
nude
dancing.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
requires
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
miller
was
not
action.
miller
was
literature.
