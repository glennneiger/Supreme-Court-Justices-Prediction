justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
light
of
the
baysinger
and
other
decisions
of
your
state's
courts
it
does
seem
that
what's
left
is
not
content
neutral
in
all
respects.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
said
today
that
indiana
has
held
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
certain
performances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
position
that
the
court
has
taken,
and
in
light
of
that,
how
can
you
take
the
position
here
that
the
statute
is
content
neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
state
prohibit
rock
music?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
is
it
that
music
is
protected
but
dance
is
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
explain
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
some
of
the
rock
music
played
in
the
ward
case
conveyed
a
message?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
artistic
message?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suggest
not
all
music
does
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
dance
in
general
might
be
communicative
under
that
test,
might
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
uhl,
if
there
were
a
videotape
of
these
performances,
could
the
state
ban
outright
the
sale
of
the
tape?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i'm
asking
you
whether
a
statute
could
withstand
a
first
amendment
test
if
it
tried
to
ban
sale
of
the
videotape
of
the
performance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
is
that?
why
can
you
ban
the
real
thing
but
not
the
videotape
of
it?
