justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you're
saying
it
would
be
permissible
to
pass
a
statute
prohibiting
tap
dancing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
under
your
view
it
doesn't
convey
any
particular
message
so
you
could
prohibit
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
would
the
case
really
be
different
if
the
dancer
had
a
sign
up
at...
on
the
stage
that
said
she
was
a
member
of
a
nudist
colony
and
she
believed
it
healthy
for
people
to
attend
nudist
colonies
and
some
message
with
it
and
then
said,
i'll
illustrate
to
you
how
nice
it
is
to
be
nude
or
something
like
that?
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
different
in
the
sense
that
you
have
a
particularized
message,
and
the
dance
is
suppose
to
dramatize
this
message
that
she's
also
got
a
sign
stating
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you'd
say
that
one
would
be
protected,
but
as
long
as
they
don't
put
such
signs
up,
it's
unprotected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
being
there's
no
reasonable
time,
place,
or
manner--
[laughter]
--for
this
kind
of
dance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
supreme
court
distinguishes
between
the
opera
singer
and
this
dancer
and
i
suppose
the
opera
singer
wants
to
make
money,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
all
the...
how
many
performers
are
involved
in
this
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
all
three
of
them
say
that
was
their
only
motive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
state
interest
in
that
distinction?
if
you
have
one
customer,
it's
okay.
if
you
have
ten,
it's
bad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that,
judge
posner
said
that
both
the
state's
highest
court
and
the
law
enforcement
officials
concurred
in
interpreting
the
statute,
not
as
a
blanket
prohibition
of
public
nudity.
is
that...
do
you
still
think
it
is
not
a
blanket
prohibition
of
public
nudity
or
do
you
now
take
the
position
it
is
a
blanket
prohibition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you...
are
going
to
have
to
give
me
alternative
argument
answers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
ever
before
argued
that
it's
a
blanket
prohibition
of
public
nudity,
including
operas
and
the
like?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
but
you
are
making
that
argument
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
believe
that
your
opponent
reasonably
should
have
anticipated
that
argument
when
he
filed
his
brief
in
opposition
to
your
cert.
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't...
in
your
second
question,
you
don't
say
a
word
about
it
being
a
blanket
prohibition
of
public
nudity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
certainly
doesn't
suggest
it
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
should
i
interpret
the
statute
as
i
face
this
case?
as
a
blanket
prohibition
or
as
a
partial
prohibition?
