justice
anthony
m.

--communicates
what?
an
idea?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
particularized
message
and
an
idea
of
sensuality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they
were
not
good
enough
dancers?
justice
kennedy
well,
could
a
dance
communicate
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
one
didn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they
were
not
good
enough
dancers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
justice
white's
question
puts
this
point.
could
you
prohibit
this
performance...
you
don't
want
to
call
it
a
dance...
if
the
women
were
clothed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
that's
no...
suppose
the
dancers
were
clothed
and
suppose
the
state
of
indiana
or
a
police
official
attempted
to
prohibit
that
performance,
a
clothed
performance,
would
the
first
amendment
protect
the
performer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
this
is
sexually
explicit
conduct
and
that
that's
a
category
that
we
can
use
to
sustain
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
the
larue
case?
anything
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
really
confident
that
we
could
make
the
distinction
between
dancing
which
is
part
of
a
greater
form
of
artistic
expression
as
opposed
to
dancing
that
is
not
artistic
expression?
who's
to
do
this?
the
legislature
to
do
this?
are
we
to
do
it,
or
both...
kind
of
a
joint
venture?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
have
no
settled
jurisprudence.
we
would
be
really
striking
out
in
a
very
new
direction,
would
we
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
larger
forms
of
expression
meriting
protection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
began
by
using
a
term...
was
it
dance
performance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
someone
wanted
to
increase
business
at
the
car
wash
or
in
a
bar
and
they
hired
a
woman
and
said,
now,
you
sit
in
this
glass
case...
and
this
is
an
adults
only
carwash--
[laughter]
--you
sit
in
this
glass
case
and
attract
the
customers.
is
that
permitted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it's
just
what
i
said.
the
employer
says
this
is
the
job,
you
is
up
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
he
said,
i've
heard
the
arguments
in
the
supreme
court
and
you
have
to
dance.
and
she
said,
i
can't
dance.
and
he
said,
just
wander
around
when
the
music
starts
to
play.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
the
point,
isn't
it?
it's
a
question
of
what
is
performance
dance.
what
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
before
you
get
there,
and
this
is
an
important
point,
but
just
on
the
last
part
about
being
related
to
expression,
what
about
a
noise
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
related
to
expression?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
nudity?
