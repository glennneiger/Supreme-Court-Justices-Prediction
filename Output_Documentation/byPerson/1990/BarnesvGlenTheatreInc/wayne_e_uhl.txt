mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
indiana
under
indiana
code,
section
35-45-4-1,
a
person
cannot
leave
his
home
naked
and
walk
down
the
street.
he
cannot
give
a
political
speech
in
a
park
without--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--that's
correct.
[laughter]
he
would
get
in
trouble,
your
honor,
if
he
walked
into
a
public
place
such
as
a
bar
or
a
bookstore
without
his
clothes
on.
once
inside
the
bar,
he
could
not
walk
naked
up
and
down
the
aisles
in
the
bar,
nor
could
he
sit
down
at
a
table
without
his
clothes
on,
nor
could
he
stand
up
on
the
bar
or
on
a
stage
at
the
front
of
that
public
establishment
without
his
clothes
on.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
plaintiffs
say
that
if
he
starts
dancing
when
he
gets
up
on
that
stage
or
up
on
that
bar,
then
he
can
do
anything...
or
anything
that
can
be
defined
as
dancing...
then
he's
privileged
under
the
first
amendment
to
appear
naked,
notwithstanding
indiana's
public
indecency
statute.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
the
indiana
supreme
court,
in
order
to
avoid
an
overbreadth
challenge,
has
held
that
the
statute
does
not
affect
activity
which
cannot
be
restricted
by
the
first
amendment.
and
the
term
that
the
court
used
in
that
case
was
"a
larger
form
of
expression".
so--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
your
honor,
the
court
looked
at
cases
such
as
southeastern
promotions
where
this
court
in
implied
that
the
production
of
hair,
for
example,
needed
to
include
nudity.
and
i
think,
drawing
from
that
line
of
cases,
presumed
that
the
first
amendment--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--the
line
is
drawn
the
same
way
the
line
is
drawn
anytime
conduct
is
involved,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
conduct
communicates.
if
the
conduct
communicates,
then
the
conduct
is
speech.
if
the
conduct
does
not
communicate,
then
the
conduct
is
not
speech.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
communicates
a
particularized
message
or
an
idea.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that
could
be
communicated.
however,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
not
establish...
did
not
carry
their
burden
of
proving
that
that
was
the
particularized
message
that
they
were
sending
by
their
dancing.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
dance,
your
honor.
it
had
to
do
with--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--yes,
a
dance
could
communicate
that.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
these
dances
did
not.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't
the
quality
of
the
dancing.
go-go
dancing
can
be
good
or
bad,
but
it
either
instance
it's
speech.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor,
our
second
issue
in
the
case
is
that
even
if
this
dance
is
speech,
then
it
can
be
restricted
under
the
first
amendment.
and
basically
we've
drawn
on
two
lines
of
cases
for
that
argument.
first,
we've
argued
that
our
statute
is
a
general
criminal
prohibition
on
public
nudity
that
applies...
that
is
no
directed
at
speech
and
is
content
neutral
in
the
sense
that
it
is
irrelevant
what
message
might
be
sent
by
the
conduct.
under
the
case...
under
last
term's
case
of
employment
division
v.
smith
which
involved
drug
use,
this
court
held
that
a
general
criminal
prohibition
such
as
that
would
be
valid
even
as
applied
to
native
americans
who
claimed
that
their
use
of
peyote
was
a
religious
practice
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
your
honor,
i
think
the
respondents
have
over
construed
baysinger
when
they
say
that
baysinger
created
some
kind
of
a
speech
exception.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
indiana's
held
that
only
if
that
is
required
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
the
indiana
supreme
court
did
not
consider
the
possibility
that
this
statute
might
be
a
reasonable
restriction
on
speech.
that
question
was
not
raised
in
the
case...
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
case.
so
basically
baysinger
is
nothing
more
than
a
tautology.
baysinger
simply
said
that
the
public
nudity
statute
can
prohibit
public
nudity
to
the
extent
allowed
by
the
first
amendment.
our
argument
here
is
that
under
this
court's
regulability
cases,
employment
division
v.
smith
or
the
other
line
of
cases,
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
cases,
that
this
activity
can
be
restricted
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
and
therefore,
it
does
not...
the
baysinger
decision
does
not
stop
this
court
from
holding
that
that
is
true
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
our
second
argument
assumes
that
the
dancing
is
speech.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
the
protection
of
the
dance
doesn't
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
clothing
is
worn
for
the
purposes
of
our
second
argument.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
the
clothing
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
the
dance
either.
that's
correct.
the
clothing
doesn't
make
the
dance
speech
and
doesn't
protect
it
as
speech.
the
dancing
is
either
speech
or
not
speech.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
not
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--oh.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
our
position
is
that
the
dancers
would
still
have
to
show
that
if
they
took
off
their
clothes
that
there's
an
extra
message.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
not
these
performances
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
unless
tap
dancing
were
shown
to
be
speech
under
the
first
amendment,
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct.
obviously
due
process
and
equal
protection
concerns
would
be--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--your
honor,
this
court
found
in
the
ward
case
that
rock
music
is
speech
under
the
first
amendment,
so
no,
it
could
not.
but--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--music
is
different--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--music
is
different
from
dance
in
that
the
very
nature
of
the
medium
is
communicative.
but
by
the
definition
of
dance
that's
been
submitted
by
the
respondents--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--an
artistic
message.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
an
artistic
message.
yes,
your
honor.
whereas
not
all
dance
conveys
an
artistic
message.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that
may
be
a
case-by-case
determination
and
this
court
hasn't
addressed
that
except
in
ward
to
say
that
music
in
general
is
communicative
and
therefore
is
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
we
would
resist
that,
your
honor,
because
dance
can
be
so
broadly
defined
as
to
include
perhaps
what
i'm
doing
here
today.
dance
can
be
any--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--well,
not
that
kind
of
song
and
dance.
[laughter]
the
respondents
have
suggested
that
a
production
in
which
nudes
simply
stand
nude
on
a
stage
would
be
dance
or
that
if
someone
were
to
simply...
rhythm
is
not
important
to
the
definition
of
a
dance.
improvisation
can
be
dance
according
to
the
respondents.
any
movement
can
be
defined
as
dance.
and
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
all
dance
as
it's
defined
there
is
speech,
then
the
first
amendment
would
be
trivialized
to
include
any
kind
of
movement
or
motion
that
expresses
some
kind
of
emotion.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct.
and
our
second
argument
assumes
arguendo
that
the
dance
is
speech
and
argues
that
even
if
it
is
speech
that
we
can
protect
under
the
statute
because
that's
correct.
the
statute
doesn't
ban
dancing.
it
doesn't
ban
performances.
it
simply
requires
that
anytime
a
person
in
indiana
appears
in
public
that
vital
areas
of
the
body
be
covered.
and
for
that
reason
this
is
the
type
of
general
criminal
prohibition
that
this
court...
such
as
the
one
in
employment
division
v.
smith...
held
can
be
applied
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
notwithstanding
a
claim
that
the
conduct
at
issue
is
protected...
is
speech
or
religious
practice
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
contention
in
this
case
that
the
dancing
at
issue
is
obscene.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
if
the
medium
is
the
message,
your
honor,
then
it's
our
contention
that
the
nudity
is
not
an
essential
part
of
that
particular
medium.
the
dance
can
be
communicated
just
as
effectively,
or
almost
as
effectively,
with
pasties
and
g-strings
covering
the
vital
parts
of
the
body
that
are
at
issue
under
the
statute.
and
it's
our
contention
that
alternative
means
of
communication
are
open
to
these
plaintiffs
and
that
the
mere
requirement
of...
that
the
certain
parts
of
the
body
be
covered
is
not
essential
to
their
communication.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
one
sense
their
claim
that
nudity
is
an
inherent
part
of
their
dance
is
no
different
than
someone
who
might
be
putting
on
a
play
and
decide
that
the
use
of
marijuana
during
the
play
is
also
protected
because
it's
connected
with
this
protected
play.
i
think
the
court
would
immediately
reject
that
argument
out
of
hand,
that
that
kind
of
criminal
conduct,
even
though
it's
in
the
context
of
a
protected
production,
can
be
criminalized
by
a
state.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct.
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
submitted
an
affidavit
where
she
said
that
she
intended
to
communicate
and
to
entertain
and
then
she
stopped
and
didn't
tell
us
what
she
intended
to
communicate
or
entertain.
and
that
respondent,
respondent
sutro,
also
failed
to
submit
any
other
evidence
of
the
type
of
dancing
that
she
wanted
to
perform.
she
did
not
submit
a
videotape,
as
did
some
of
the
respondents,
nor
did
she
even
just
submit
to
the
court
a
verbal
or
written
description
of
the
dancing
that
she
wished
to
perform.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor,
that
would
be
no
different
than
the
case
in
florida
of
the
sunbathers
who
claimed
that
they
wanted
to
bathe
out
on
the
beach,
and
show--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--in
terms
of
the
particularized
message,
then
it
would
be
a
different
case.
you
could
very
well--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--it
would
be
speech.
and
whether
it
would
be
protected
then
is
the
question
of
whether
the
state
can
regulate
it,
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
under
this
statute
we
can
still
require
her
to
wear
the
minimal
covering
because...
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it's
speech.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
it's
either
because
of
the
application
of
employment
division
v.
smith,
because
this
is
a
general
criminal
statute,
or
it's
by
application
of
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
test
that
this
court
has
applied
in
other
contexts.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
your
honor,
reasonable
place
in
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
a
public
place.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
and
the
indiana
courts
have
very
carefully
defined
public
place.
reasonable
manner
in
that
this
is
a
restriction
simply
on
the
manner
of
appearing,
that
is
that
there
are
certain
parts
of
the
body
that
need
to
be
covered,
and
it's
our
position
that
that
is
sufficient
narrowly
tailored,
just
as
the
clothing
on
the
dancers
is
narrowly
tailored,
to
accomplish
the
state's
interests
in
prohibiting
public
nudity.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
this
court
has
found...
in
the
clark
case
the
court
indicated
that
the
o'brien
test
is
really
no
different
than
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
test.
we
set
them
out
separately
in
our
brief,
but
basically
it's
the
same
test.
you
look
for
a
substantial
government
interest
that
is
forwarded
by
the
statute
in
a
manner
that
leaves
open
alternative
means
of
communication.
and
i
may
not
have
articulated
o'brien
precisely,
but
i
think
the
court
indicated
in
clark
that
they're
basically
the
same
test.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor,
because
the
videotape
would
not
be
live
conduct,
and
the
statute
only
goes
to...
and
our
first
amendment
argument
only
applies
to
live
conduct
as
opposed
to
depictions.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor,
not
unless
the
videotape
were
obscene.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
this
court
has
always
made
a
distinction
between
depictions
of
conduct
and
live
conduct
itself.
and
i
think
that's
because
live
conduct
is
something
that
is
traditionally
subject
to
state
regulation
and
is
something
that
more
vividly
presents
the
concerns
that
are
at
interest
when
the
state
try...
legislates
in
this
particular
area.
the
court
has
always
said
that
live
conduct
is
to
be
treated
differently.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
we're
not
arguing
that
it's
a
special
category
that
therefore
is
excluded
from
the
first
amendment.
however,
i
believe
there
is
some
support
for
the
proposition
that
because
this
is
sexually
explicit
speech
that
it
may
deserve
a
lesser
level
in
a
balancing
test.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
not
off
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor.
there's
another
aspect
of
it
that
is
also...
falls
into
that
kind
of
category
and
that
is
the
commercial
nature
of
the
speech.
we've
never
argued
here
that
because
this
is
commercial-type
speech
that
it
therefore
falls
into
the
category
of
advertising.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
at
least
one
of
the
respondents
said
that
the
only
reason
that
she
dances
nude
is
in
order
to
make
more
money.
and
we
think
that
in
balancing
the
impact
of
the
statute
against
the
rights
of
these
women
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
conduct
the
court
can
take
into
account
the
fact
that
this
is
a
speech
that's
done
largely
for
a
commercial
purpose.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
your
honor,
it's
different.
dickens
wrote
his
book
largely
because
he
needed
income,
not
only
because
he
needed
income,
and
there's
a
distinction
there
to
be
made.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
i'm
sure
what
darlene
miller's
intent
was,
your
honor,
and
that
was
to
make
money.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
true,
although
again
the
opera
singer
is
in
the
position
where
that's
not
the
only
thing
that
she
wants
to
do,
but
that
the
money
is
an
important
part
of
it.
so
we
can't
distinguish
this
just
on
the
fact
that
she's
making
money.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
in
this
litigation
i
think
there
are
three
dancers
who
are
actually
a
part--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--no,
your
honor,
only
darlene
miller
did.
we
can
infer,
though,
that
gayle
sutro
who
danced
at
the
chippewa
book
store
had
a
commercial
motive
as
well
because
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
reason
she
was
dancing
at
the
chippewa
book
store
was
to
promote
a
movie
that
was
playing
at
the
drive-in
next
door.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
we
didn't
ban
the
movie.
we
were
only
banning
her
coming
in
and
promoting
it
nude.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
your
honor,
as
in
the
case
of
obscenity
where
one
of
the
issues
is
the
artistic
value
of
the
work,
trial
judges
and
trial
juries
make
the
distinction
under...
in
criminal
prosecutions
under
this
statute,
just
as
in
an
obscenity
case--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--well,
your
honor,
there's...
ever
since
miller
v.
california,
juries
have
been
determining
whether
works
that
are
charged
to
be
obscene
have
artistic
value.
so
we
believe
that
it's
simply
application
of
the
same
kind
of
test
in
this
context.
i'd
like
to
go
through
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
test
just
to
make
sure
that
all
three
elements
of
that
have
been
presented
here.
the...
as
i've
said,
this
is
a
place
restriction
because
it
is
limited
to
public
places.
it
is
a
manner
restriction
because
it's
a
restriction
on
the
manner
of
dancing,
that
is,
nude
or
not
nude.
in
that
way
it's
just
like
the
rock
music
situation
in
the
ward
case,
where
this
court
held
that
the
volume
restrictions
on
that
rock
music
were
a
manner
restriction
on
it.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rock
musicians
would
have
said
that
the
full
impact
of
their
music
was
lessened
by
the
restrictions
on
the
volume
there,
and
the
dancers
here
may
very
well
say
that
the
full
impact
of
their
dancing
is
lessened
by
the
requirement
of
clothes,
but
that
does
not
change
the
fact
that
this
is
a
manner
restriction.
the
three
elements
of
a
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
are
met
here.
first,
the
statute
is
context
neutral,
that
is,
it
is
justified
without
reference
to
the
content
of
the
speech.
in
fact,
this
statute
applies
regardless
of
whether
there
is
speech
involved,
whether
this
is
simply
someone
walking
through
the
park
or
whether
it's
someone
who
is
giving
a
political
speech.
the
second...
the
noncontent
concerns
here
are
very
important.
the
most
important
is
the
traditional
requirement
in
our
society
that
certain
body
parts
be
covered
in
public.
this
goes
back
to
the
common
law
offense
of
public
indecency
and
can
be
traced
even
further
back
in
western
culture.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
as
of
now...
all
the
supreme
court
has
done
in
indiana
is
said
that
the
statute
isn't
overbroad
and
the
reason
the
statute
is
not
overbroad
is
because
we
assume...
and
i'm
reading
this
in...
we
assume
that
the
first
amendment
puts
limits
on
our
ability
to
ban
nudity.
and
the
way
that
assumption
was
stated
in
the
baysinger
was
we
assumed
that
nudity
must
be
tolerated
in
certain
larger
forms
of
expression.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
larger
forms
of
expression.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
meriting
protection.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that
very
well
may
be
true.
but
if
the
court
holds
that,
then
we
still
believe
that
this
is
a
reasonable
regulation
upon
the
dancing.
did
i
adequately
explain
the
baysinger
decision,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
is
important?
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
second
element
of
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
is
whether
the
statute
is
sufficiently
narrowly
tailored.
the
statute's
definition
of
nudity
is
extremely
narrow
and
carefully
defined.
furthermore,
the
indiana
courts
have
carefully
defined
the
term
public
place.
for
example,
a
situation
where
a
single
viewer
goes
into
a
booth
and
views
a
single
dancer
through
a
glass
plate
and
closes
the
door
behind
him
to
do
so,
the
indiana
supreme...
the
indiana
courts
have
said
that
that
is
not
a
public
place
under
the
statute.
however,
what
we
have
in
this
case
in
the
chippewa
book
store
is
a
ring
of
booths
around
a
stage
where
a
multitude
of
customers
can
watch
the
same
dancers
at
the
same
time.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
well,
the
state
interest,
your
honor,
is
that
the
more
this
becomes
an
audience
participation
kind
of
a
situation
that
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
that
kind
of
conduct
increases.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
it
is
also
an
adult
bookstore,
that
is,
it
sells
pornographic
materials
in
addition
to
offering
this
kind
of
booth
entertainment.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
no,
your
honor,
i
think
baysinger
would
then
very
much
be
cut
back,
because
if
this
court
were
also
to
hold,
as
we've
urged
in
our
second
argument,
that
we
can
still
restrict
this
activity
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
then
we
can
still
do
that.
baysinger--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
the
plaintiffs...
back
to
narrowly
tailored.
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
we're
required
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
this
statute
based
on
the
presence
of
consenting
adults.
however,
we've
argued
that
that's
not
required.
first
of
all,
that
would
be
basically
imposing
a
least-restrictive
means
test,
which
this
court
has
never
required.
second,
consent
is
irrelevant,
as
in
other
public
offenses
such
as
prostitution
or
drug
use.
third,
the
concerns
that
the
state
is
after
in
this
particular
kind
of
statute
are
even
more
prevalent
in
this
type
of
business
than
in
other
type
of
businesses.
finally,
the
statute
does
leave
open
alternative
forms
of
expression,
as
i've
argued
previously.
the
dancers
have
never
asserted
credibly
that
they...
that
their
message
is
substantially
changed
or
inhibited
by
the
requirement
that
they
wear
pasties
and
g-strings.
therefore,
we
would...
we
are
asking
that
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
this
case
invalidating
the
statute
as
applied
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
the
second
issue
presented
in
the
petition
is
properly
before
the
court
for
three
reasons.
first,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
the
issue
was
clearly
raised
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
there
was
no
suggestion
of
waiver
in
the
respondents'
briefs
in
opposition.
second,
the
issue
was
fully
decided
by
all
of
the
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
below.
only
one
concurring
judge,
after
addressing
the
merits,
suggested
that
the
issued
may
have
been
waived.
but
he,
too,
joined
the
majority
opinion
in
which
the
court
clearly
applied
but
found
lacking
our
statute
under
the
reasonable,
time,
place,
and
manner
test.
and
finally,
we
believe
the
issue
is
fairly
included
within
the
first
issue
that's
presented,
that
at...
resolution
to
the
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case
would
be
unsatisfactory
if
the
court
simply
stopped
at
a
determination
of
whether
this
activity
is
speech
without
also
determining
whether
or
not
it's
regulable
under
this
statute.
so
we
believe
the
question
is
fairly
before
the
court.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
for
the
purposes
of
our
first
argument--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--yes,
your
honor,
we've
made
alternative
arguments
here.
for
the
purpose--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
the
statute
stands
under
that
argument.
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
went
ahead
and
addressed
that
issue
and
then
in
our
second
issue
in
the
cert.
petition
we
clearly
raised
that
issue:
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
a
valid...
the
public
nudity
statute...
is
a
valid--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--i
don't
remember
the
exact
frame--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--but
i
believe
it
says
that
whether
the
statute
is
a
valid
regulation,
and
i
believe
the
text
of
our
cert
petition
clearly--
mr.
wayne
e.
uhl
--as
a
blanket
prohibition,
your
honor.
as
we
suspected,
the
respondents
have
argued
here
today
that
basically
any
conduct
anywhere
that
resembles
dance
is
speech.
the
burden
is
then
on
the
state
to
justify
our
regulation
of
that
conduct
even
if
it's
in
a
window
in
carwash,
such
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
or
out
in
the
public
park.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
held
that
a
state
is
required
to
come
in
with
a
common
law
crime
that
was
in
existence
many,
many
years
before
the
constitution
and
the
first
amendment
were
adopted
and
justify
that
statute
as
applied
to
live
conduct.
there's
been
quite
a
bit
of
discussion
during
mr.
ennis'
argument
of
the
state's
interest
in
this
case,
and
we'll
confess
a
handicap
here
and
that
is
that
indiana
does
not
record
legislative
history.
therefore,
to
some
extent
when
the
attorney
general's
office
or
even
the
indiana
supreme
court
suggests
what
the
state's
interests
are
in
upholding
this
statute,
the
legislative
intent
is
simply
inferred
there.
there
is
no
clear
record
of
legislative
intent
in
this
statute.
but
again
we
go
back
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
common
law
offense
that
involves
traditional
notions
in
our
culture
of
what
constitutes
public
decency
in
a
public
place.
and
when
it
comes
down
to
the
fine
tuning
what
we
find
is
not
that
the
defendant...
that
the
respondents
have
any
problem
with
the
statute
or
its
goals,
but
simply
they
disagree
with
our
definition
of
what
is
a
public
place.
and
that's
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
and
the
legislature
to
determine
and
as
long
as
that
is
a
reasonable
determination
that
is
reasonably
related
to
the
goals
of
the
statute,
then
the
first
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
state
of
indiana
from
enforcing
this
statute.
therefore,
again,
we
would
ask
that
the
seventh
circuit's
invalidating
of
the
statute
be
reversed
and
that
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
