mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prior
to
the
decision
below
it
was
the
law
in
virtually
all
jurisdictions
that
shareholders
need
not
make
demand
before
commencing
a
derivative
action
where
that
demand
would
be
futile.
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
abolished
the
traditional
futility
exception
and
replaced
it
with
a
rule
that
requires
universal
demand
in
every
case.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
addressing
this
question
as
one
of
federal
common
law
for
the
courts
of
appeals
to
decide
as
they
perceive
the
policy
balances
to
require.
rather,
state
law
should
govern
this
area
of
core
governance
of
corporations'
internal
affairs,
absent
a
conflict
with
federal
policy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
case
that's
closest
related
to
the
particular
problem
here
today
is
burks
v.
lasker.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
quite
similar,
really.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
was
another
derivative
action
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
two
responses
i'd
like
to
give
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
whether
demand
is
required
or
not
is
a
federal
question
because
the
cause
of
action
arises
under
a
federal
statute.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
the
next
issue
is
from
what
source
does
federal
law
derive
the
rule
of
decision.
this
court
has
in
many
contexts
held
that
even
when
a
question
is
governed
by
federal
law,
federal
law
may
turn
to
state
law
rather
than
fashioning
an
entire
body
of
law
on
its
own.
i
think
the
kimbell
foods
case
is
the
outstanding
example
of
this,
and
the
court
applied
a
very
similar
principle
in
burks
v.
lasker
when
it
comes
to
the
law
of
corporations.
corporations,
after
all,
are
created
under
state
law.
when
congress
regulated
in
the
investment
company
act,
as
it
did
in
the
other
securities
acts
to
regulate
corporate
activities,
it
did
not
provide
for
federal
chartering
of
corporations.
it
relied
on
states
to
charter
corporations
and
to
basically
regulate
the
activities
of
corporations
subject
only
to
the
predominant
federal
policy.
so
federal
law
displaces
state
law
to
the
extent
it
is
necessary
to
achieve
federal
goals.
otherwise
state
law
governs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
in
our
view
the
initial
step
for
a
court
to
follow
is
to
adopt
that
rule,
and
then
to
consider
whether
it
infringes
any
federal
policy
to
follow
it.
that
question,
of
course,
isn't
here
today,
since
we
don't
have
a
state
that
provided
for
universal
demand,
although
there
are
several.
i
think
that
the
real
way
to
answer
whether
it
conforms
to
federal
policy
is
to
look
at
what
happens
after
demand
is
made.
does
that...
does
the
making
of
demand
in
a
particular
state
give
the
corporation
a
leg-up
in
dismissing
the
derivative
action?
if
it
does
and
the
corporation
is
invested
with
too
much
power
to
cut
off
a
federal
claim,
there
may
very
well
be
a
conflict
with
federal
policy.
but
it
probably
will
not
flow
from
the
demand
requirement
itself.
it
more
likely
will
flow
from
what
happens
after
demand
is
made
and
refused.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
seventh
circuit
thought
it
could
achieve
a
nice
distinction,
a
very
logical,
tidy
distinction
between
a
federal
rule
of
universal
demand
and
state
law
governing
what
happens
after
demand
is
made.
the
problem
with
that
approach
is,
although
it
sounds
nice
in
theory,
in
fact
it
doesn't
work.
the
reason
it
doesn't
work
is
because
many
states
place
an
integral
connection
between
whether
a
shareholder
has
to
make
demand
and
what
standard
of
review
is
subsequently
applied
to
the
board
of
directors'
decision.
so
delaware,
for
example,
which
is
a
leading
state
in
corporate
law,
says
that
if
a
demand
is
required
of
the
shareholder
and
not
excused,
then
the
directors'
subsequent
decision
not
to
sue
is
judged
very
deferentially
under
the
business
judgment
rule.
on
the
other
hand,
if
demand
is
futile
because
the
board
is
either
biased
or
too
implicated
in
the
transaction
to
act
on
it,
then
a
much
higher
standard
of
review
applies
when
the
corporation
attempts
to
terminate
the
suit.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
the
court
said
exactly
either
of
those
things.
if
it
said...
if
it
thought
it
was
saying
that
it's
a
federal
question
what
standard
of
review
applies
to
the
board
of
directors'
decision,
then
in
effect
it
overruled
burks
v.
lasker,
because
burks
v.
lasker
held
that
the
power
of
corporate
directors
to
terminate
a
derivative
action,
even
based
on
a
federal
statute,
derives
in
the
first
instance
from
state
law
unless
it
conflicts
with
federal
policy.
so
there's
a
two-pronged
inquiry.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
intended
that.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
is
that
we
can
have
a
federal
rule,
which
it
thought
was
procedural,
of
universal
demand
followed
by
the
application
of
state
law
as
it's
found.
but
the
real
difficulty
with
that
proposition,
i
think,
is
that
state
law
simply
does
not
draw
the
distinction
between
demand
and
the
standard
of
review
in
every
instance.
in
some
cases,
in
many,
it
ties
them
together.
and
once
a
shareholder
makes
a
demand
under
delaware
law,
the
business
judgment
rule
applies
in
every
single
case.
so
under
the
seventh
circuit's
federal
universal
demand
rule
you
have
two
options.
one
option
would
be
to
say
since
the
shareholder
made
a
demand
we
now
apply
the
delaware
standard
of
review.
it's
the
business
judgment
rule,
in
every
single
case,
even
though
delaware
might
have
applied
a
different
standard
because
demand
was
actually
futile.
the
other
alternative...
that
alternative
i
think
is
not
only
conceptually
incorrect,
it
overrides
state
policy
needlessly.
the
other
alternative
would
be
for
the
court
to
engage
in
a
hypothetical
inquiry.
would
delaware
have
excused
demand
in
this
case?
if
we
answer
that
question
we'll
then
know
what
standard
of
review
delaware
wanted
to
apply.
but
if
you
engage
in
that
inquiry
you're
right
back
where
you
started.
you're
litigating
demand
futility,
and
the
court
of
appeals
rule
serves
no
purpose.
the
basic
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
got
off
on
the
wrong
foot,
i
think,
is
it
evaluated
the
demand
question
as
one
of
federal
procedure.
it's
really
not.
it's
really
a
rule
that
governs
substantive
law
of
corporate
internal
affairs.
a
corporation
may
have
a
claim
that
can
be
asserted
in
court,
but
it
is
an
artificial
entity,
and
the
question
in
a
derivative
action
is
who
has
the
right
to
speak
for
a
corporation.
normally
it's
the
board
of
directors
under
state
law,
but
state
law
almost
universally
recognizes
an
exception
for
derivative
actions
where
the
directors
have
wrongfully
refused
to
protect
corporate
claims.
in
that
instance
shareholders
may
step
in
and
speak
for
the
corporation.
the
demand
rule
stands
as
a
threshold
requirement
that
helps
to
regulate
when
shareholders
can
do
that.
the
demand
rule
says
that
before
shareholders
may
take
the
extraordinary
step
of
usurping
the
board
of
directors'
prerogatives,
they
have
to
make
a
demand
on
the
directors
to
see
whether
the
directors
want
to
take
over
the
suit
or
how
they
will
react
to
it,
to
give
them
a
chance
to
make
a
corporate
judgment.
state
law,
however,
recognizes
that
in
some
instances
it
would
only
obstruct
the
protection
of
shareholder
rights,
who
are,
after
all,
the
owners
of
the
corporation,
to
have
to
go
to
the
very
board
of
directors
that
may
be
implicated
in
the
transaction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
simplify
things
if
there
were
a
coherent
way
of
applying
it,
and
the
way
of
applying
it
were
consistent
with
federal
law.
but
the
way
that
many
states
regulate
derivative
actions
is
that
if
demand
is
excused
the
courts
take
a
more
active
role
in
regulating
the
directors'
efforts
to
cut
it
off.
if
demand
is
required,
then
the
directors
have
a
greater
power.
they
can
rely
on
their
business
judgment
and
say
this
derivative
action
should
be
terminated.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
certainly
possible
the
states
might
be
forced
to
change
their
internal
law
of
corporations
if
federal
law
reached
out
and
grabbed
a
portion
of
it.
but
there
is
no
authorization--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
if
the
court
in
burks
v.
lasker
had
ruled
that
it
is
always
a
federal
question
when
directors
can
terminate
a
derivative
action
under
a
federal
statute,
then
we
would
not
be
here
today
arguing
that
state
law
is
the
primary
source.
but
once
burks
v.
lasker
and
its
principles
are
established
there
is
really
no
alternative
but
to
borrow
the
coherent
set
of
state
law
rather
than
simply
taking
one
piece
of
it
here
and
another
piece
of
it
from
federal
law.
thank
you.
