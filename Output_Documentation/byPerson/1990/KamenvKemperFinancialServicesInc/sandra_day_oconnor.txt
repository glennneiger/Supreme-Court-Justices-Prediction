justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
meyer,
under
the
seventh
circuit's
view,
if
a
demand
is
made
and
refused,
what's
the
legal
effect
of
that
on
the
suit?
can
it
go
forward?
justice
o'connor
under
the
seventh
circuit's
holding?
justice
o'connor
and
how
do
you
understand
its
holding
in
that
regard?
what
would
be
the
effect?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be.
let's
assume
it
is
a
recommendation
not
to
go
forward.
justice
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
that's
a
little
odd,
isn't
it,
because
this
is
an
action
brought
under
a
federal
statute?
justice
o'connor
a
federal
cause
of
action.
and
the
cases
saying
that
you
nevertheless
look
to
state
law
are
a
little
unusual,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
yes.
i
guess
i
just
don't
understand
that
case,
and
why,
when
you
have
a
cause
of
action
based
on
violation
of
a
federal
law
you
would
have
to
look
to
state
law
for
one
of
these
initial
sort
of
procedural
requirements.
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
state
law
says
that
there
will
be
a
demand
made
in
every
case?
justice
o'connor
and
how
do
you
read
the
seventh
circuit's
holding
about...
insofar
as
that
is
concerned?
justice
o'connor
--well,
what
should
apply
in
another
suit
where
the
state
law
argument
is
not
waived?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
demand
requirement?
what
happens
if
the
demand
is
rejected?
now
what
law
do
we
look
to?
justice
o'connor
well,
we
certainly
have
to
be
concerned
with
it,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
questions
are
very
much
interrelated
ultimately.
