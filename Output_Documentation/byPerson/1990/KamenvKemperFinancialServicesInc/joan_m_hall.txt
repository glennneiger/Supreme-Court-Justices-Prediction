ms.
joan
m.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
correctly
dismissed
the
proxy
claim
in
this
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
affirmed
that
dismissal.
we
respectfully
submit
that
regardless
of
whether
this
court
chooses
to
apply
federal
law
or
state
law,
and
regardless
of
whether
the
futility
exception
is
applied
or
the
futility
exception
is
abolished,
this
court
should
affirm
the
dismissal
of
the
proxy
claim
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
both
courts
below
correctly
concluded
that
the
allegations
of
futility
in
the
complaint
in
this
case
were
totally
inadequate
to
excuse
the
making
of
a
demand
upon
the
directors.
second,
both
courts
below
correctly
concluded
that
federal
law
should
apply
in
dealing
with
the
demand
issue
on
this
federal
cause
of
action.
and
third,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
under
federal
law
the
futility
exception
to
the
demand
requirement
should
be
eliminated
in
order
to
promote
important
policies
underlying
the
demand
requirement,
including
judicial
economy.
turning
first
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
allegations,
the
district
court
found
that
if
you
disregard
the
conclusory
allegations
in
petitioner's
complaint
only
two
factual
allegations
of
futility
remain,
that
the
directors
receive
fees
for
serving
as
directors,
and
the
directors
voted
to
send
out
the
challenged
proxy
material.
petitioner
cites
no
case,
state
or
federal,
in
which
boilerplate
allegations
of
futility
such
as
these
have
been
held
to
excuse
demand.
the
federal
law
as
to
facts
which
would
be
sufficient
to
excuse
the
making
of
a
demand
is
well
stated
in
the
kauffman
case.
in
kauffman
the
first
circuit
said
that
demand
could
be
excused
only
upon
a
particularized
showing
that
the
directors
are
so
antagonistic
to
the
interests
of
the
corporation
that
they
could
not
discharge
their
duties.
in
our
case
the
directors
are
not
named
as
defendants,
nor
are
they
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
any
wrongdoing
whatsoever.
this
is
particularly
significant
because
full
discovery
on
the
merits
was
available
to
petitioner
in
this
case.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
they
did,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
think
that
issue
is
properly
before
the
court
and
that
it
provides
an
independent
ground
for
affirming
the
judgment
of
dismissal,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
and
it
also
is
one
part
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
seventh
circuit
has
alternative
holdings.
they
specifically
find
that
the
allegations
are
insufficient,
and
then
they
go
forward
with
this
alternative
holding
abolishing
the
futility
exception.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
it
is
an
alternative
holding,
we
believe.
the
seventh
circuit
expressly
states
that
the
district
court
found
the
allegations
of
futility
insufficient,
as
do
we.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
at
both
a16
and
a17
of
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
the
seventh
circuit
finds
the
allegations
of
futility
to
be--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--insufficient.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
at
a16,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
states
the
district
court
thought
these
allegations
insufficient
to
excuse
a
demand
under
rule
23.1,
as
do
we.
that's
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
paragraph
under
roman
numeral
i.
and
at
a17...
no,
i've
got
the
wrong
page
number
there.
well,
there's
another
place
in
the
opinion
where
the
district
court...
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
the
able
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
these
allegations
of
futility
are
insufficient,
and
then
states
we
are
in
accord.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i'm
sorry.

ms.
joan
m.

6a,
your
honor.
roman
numeral
i,
the
first
paragraph,
the
last
sentence
in
the
paragraph.
"judge
nordberg
thought
these
allegations
insufficient
to
excuse
a
demand
under
rule
23.1,
as
do
we.
"
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
think
it's
an
alternative
holding,
your
honor,
and
provides
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
of
the
dismissal
in
this
case.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
think
he...
i
think
he
also
reviews
these
particular
allegations
and
finds
them
insufficient,
and
goes
on
to
say
in
addition
that
he
is
abolishing
futility
as
an
exception
to
the
demand
requirement.
your
honors,
even
after
substantial
discovery
in
this
case
petitioner
did
not
make
any
charges
of
wrongdoing
against
these
directors,
and
we
think
that
the
allegations
of
futility
in
this
case
were
completely
inadequate,
whether
the
court
chooses
to
apply
federal
law
or
state
law.
we
think
that
both
courts
below
properly
chose
to
apply
federal
law
to
the
demand
issue
in
this
federal
cause
of
action
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
petitioner
induced
both
courts
below
to
apply
federal
law,
and
waived
any
argument
that
state
law
applies.
petitioner
cited
only
federal
law
to
the
district
court.
petitioner
did
not
mention
state
law
until
her
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
even
then
she
argued
only
that
if
the
court
did
not
apply
federal
law,
then
state
law
should
be
applied.
the
district...
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
state
law
argument
had
been
waived,
relying
upon
a
rule
of
that
court,
a
rather
unremarkable
rule
which
holds
that
reply
briefs
are
to
be
limited
to
matters
in
reply.
the
court
of
appeals
has
consistently
applied
that
rule
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases.
petitioner
here
failed
to
comply
with
that
rule,
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
concluded
that
the
state
law
argument
had
been
waived.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
in
that
instance,
justice
o'connor,
we
submit
that
federal
law
would
apply,
and
that's
the
second
reason
why
we
think
federal
law
properly
applies
in
this
case.
in
burks
this
court
stated
that
legal
rules
that
govern
legal...
federal
causes
of
action
are
to
be
treated
as
raising
federal
questions.
and
since
federal
law
applies
to
this
federal
cause
of
action,
the
question
then
becomes
what
is
the
source
of
this
federal
law?
is
the
federal
court
going
to
look
to
federal
common
law
or
to
state
law?
in
burks
this
court
looked
to
state
law
to
supply
the
federal
rule
of
decision
on
the
question
regarding
directors'
power
to
terminate
shareholders'
derivative
litigation.
the
court
found
that
applying
state
law
to
the
corporate
law
issue
in
that
case
would
relieve
the
federal
court
of
the
burden
of
fashioning
out
of
whole
cloth
an
entire
body
of
federal
corporate
law.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
much
different
than
burks.
this
case
also
involves
a
federal
cause
of
action,
so
federal
law
applies.
but
at
the
next
step,
which
is
selecting
the
source
of
the
federal
law,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
need
here
to
look
to
state
law.
here
the
federal
court
has
a
fully
developed
body
of
federal
common
law
of
demand
which
stems
from
this
court's
decision
in
hawes
in
1882
which
created
a
demand
requirement.
here
the
court
does
not
need
to
fashion
entirely
out
of
whole
cloth
a
law
of,
federal
common
law
of
demand.
that
law
already
exists.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
your
honor,
the
question
of
standard
of
review
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
and
the
commission
is
in
agreement
with
us
on
that
point,
that
this
court
should
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--we
think,
your
honor,
that
under
burks
the
question
of
standard
of
review
would
be
governed
by
state
law,
and
in
fact
that
statement
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
can't
speak
for
the
solicitor
general.
let
me
say
again
that
the
standard
of
review
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
and
there
are
no
questions
of
delaware
law
presented
in
this
case.
if
state
law
applies
it's
only
a
maryland
law.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
think
the
standard
is
not
unworkable,
your
honor.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
adopt
a
very
straightforward
rule
that
in
every
derivative
case
the
shareholder
must
make
a
demand
before
proceeding
to
the
federal
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said
nothing
about
what
the
standard
of
review
should
be.
therefore
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
applies
only
to
steps
that
the
shareholder
must
take
before
the
shareholder
is
permitted
to
go
to
court.
after
the
shareholder
goes
to
court
the
very
same
state
law
which
now
exists
can
be
applied,
only
at
that
time--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--no.
at
that
point,
for
example
in
a
case
which
delaware
characterizes
now
as
demand
excused,
the
shareholder
plaintiff
would
still
be
required
under
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
to
make
a
demand.
however,
the
shareholder
could
then
file
suit
if
the
demand
was
refused
and
contend
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
demand
should
have
been
excused.
the
federal
court
could
then
rule
upon
that
with
the
benefit
of
actual
experience
rather
than
having
to
deal
with
hypothetical
facts
about
what
the
board
would
have
done
had
it
been
presented
with
a
demand.
your
honors--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
either
the
corporation
will
decide
to
take
up
the
cudgels
on
behalf
of
the
shareholders,
or
in
fact
the
board
of
directors
of
a
corporation
when
they
are
presented
with
demand
have
a
whole
range
of
intra-corporate
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
available
to
them.
for
example,
the
shareholder
may
be
acting
on
mistaken
information.
the
corporation
may
be
able
to
furnish
correct
information
and
settle
the
dispute
that
way.
there's
a
whole
range
of
options
that
the
board
of
directors
can
exercise
when
presented
with
a
demand
which
may
totally
obviate
the
suit
so
that
it
never,
never
appears
in
the
federal
courts.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
have
two
answers.
one
is
the
answer
we
have
already
discussed,
which
is
that
some
of
those
cases
may
never
end
up
in
court.
the
second
answer
is,
if
they
do
end
up
in
court,
the
court
can
then
conduct
its
analysis
on
the
basis
of
actual
facts
rather
than
hypotheticals,
which
is
how
litigation
normally
is
conducted.
this
case
differs
from
burks
for
another
reason,
which
is
that
the
court
in
burks
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
when
directors
may
properly
terminate
shareholders'
litigation
was
concerned
with
an
issue
of
the
directors'
powers,
which
this
court
found
to
be
a
core
issue
of
corporate
law--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--it...
i
believe
the
precise
question,
your
honor,
was
whether
they
had
the
power
to
terminate,
whether
a
special
litigation
committee
appointed
by
the
board
of
directors
had
the
power
to
terminate
a
suit
brought
under
the
1940
act.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
a
shareholder.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
a
derivative
suit.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
in
this
case
we're
not...
we
are
confronted
with
an
issue
involving
the
futility
exception
to
the
demand
requirement
which
is
not
a
core
issue
of
corporate
law.
this
question
deals
with
the
relationship
between
the
shareholder
and
the
federal
court,
and
what
the
shareholder
has
to
do
before
he
is
permitted
to
file
suit
in
the
federal
court.
it
is
not
an
issue
of
corporate
law.
it
is
an
issue
relating
to
demand,
and
as
i
mentioned,
we
have
a
fully
developed
body
of
federal
common
law
of
demand
stemming
from
this
court's
decision
in
hawes.
there
is
an
additional
reason
for
applying
a
federal
common
law
of
demand,
and
that
is
the
need
for
uniform...
uniformity
in
the
rules
governing
access
to
the
federal
courts.
legal
proceedings
in
the
federal
courts
should
be
administered
under
uniform,
predictable
rules.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
yes.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
yes.
i
believe
under
burks.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
well,
i
think--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--i
think
that
that
argument
is
foreclosed
by
burks,
and
we're
not
urging
the
overruling
of
burks.
and
also
i
think
that
that
issue
more
directly
implicates
the
power
of
directors,
which
is
a
core
issue
of
corporate
law.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
whereas
our
issue
deals
with
the
right
of
shareholders
to
come
to
the
federal
court.
we
think
that
applying
the
laws
of
the
50
states
to,
with
regard
to
the
futility
exception
to
the
demand
requirement
will
result
in
unnecessary
litigation
over
what
should
be
a
straightforward
matter.
the
virtue
of
a
uniform
federal
law
of
demand
is
particularly
evident
under
the
federal
policy
that
is
reflected
in
the
independent
director
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
and
in
the
burks
decision
this
court
considered
those
independent
director
provisions
and
noted
that
those
directors
are
to
serve
as
watch
dogs
for
the
interests
of
all
of
the
shareholders
of
the
mutual
funds.
applying
a
uniform
federal
law
of
demand
will
help
ensure
that
the
demand
rules
do
not
evolve
in
such
a
way
as
to
usurp
the
watch
dog
role
of
the
independent
directors
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
as
my
third
argument,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
this
judgment
can
be
approved
on
the
separate
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
futility
exception
to
the
demand
requirement
should
be
abolished.
this
was
a
very
straightforward
rule
and
would
require
demand
in
all
cases.
we
believe
that
abolishing
the
futility
exception
will
benefit
the
federal
judicial
system
without
unduly
burdening
shareholder
laintiffs,
and
that
abolishing
the
futility
exception
is
a
natural
evolution
of
the
common
law
which
will
help
sustain
the
vitality
of
the
demand
requirement.
looking
first
at
judicial
economy,
when
hawes
was
decided
the
federal
courts
were
in
need
of
protection
from
the
collusive
manufacture
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
today
the
federal
courts
are
confronted
with
cases
where
the
futility
exception
is
routinely
used
in
order
to
avoid
intra-corporate
means
of
resolving
disputes.
in
each
case
involving
the
futility
exception
the
district
court
must
confront
as
a
threshold
issue
the
hypothetical
fact-specific
question
as
to
whether
demand
would
have
been
futile
because
the
board
is
alleged
to
be
biased
or
to
have
engaged
in
some
improper
conduct.
we
submit
that
requiring
demand
in
all
cases
is
preferable
to
expending
time,
money,
and
scarce
judicial
resources
on
this
hypothetical
inquiry
as
to
whether
demand
would
have
been
futile.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
i
do
not,
your
honor.
as
we
have
been
discussing,
i
think
there
is
no
logical
or
practical
reason
that
you
cannot
separate
the
making
of
a
demand
from
the
standard
of
review,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
several
times
in
their
opinion
that
they
were
not
making
any
link
between
the
making
of
a
demand
and
the
standard
of
review
to
be
applied
to
the
board's
decision
in
dealing
with
the
demand.
i
think
that
requiring
a
demand
will
not
place
any
undue
burden
on
shareholders.
all
they
have
to
do
is
write
a
letter
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation,
and
that
in
turn
allows
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation
to
have
the
option
of
trying
to
take
some
kind
of
action
which
will
obviate
the
lawsuit.
that
does
not
place
any
burden
on
the
shareholder
plaintiff
other
than
mailing
the
letter.
it's
only
at
this
second
stage,
which
is
not
before
the
court
today,
the
stage
of
standard
of
review
of
the
board's
action,
of
that,
in
connection
with
that--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
there
will
be
a
certain
number
of
cases
in
which
the
board
will
be
able
to
take
action
which
will
obviate
the
need
for
a
lawsuit.
ms.
joan
m.

it's
not
impossible,
but
it
becomes
very
unlikely,
and
the
case
law
is
very
clear
that
demand
futility
is
to
be
determined
as
of
the
time
suit
is
commenced.
the
courts
have
recognized
that
as
soon
as
a
lawsuit
is
filed,
positions
become
hardened,
people
become
adversaries--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--it
just
happens
to
be
true.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
case
is
a
classic
example
of
a
situation
where
a
demand
should
have
been
made.
if
the
fund
directors
in
this
case
had
been
presented
with
a
demand
instead
of
a
complaint,
they
might
very
well
have
chosen
to
distribute
a
revised
proxy
material
even
if
they
didn't
think
that
anything
was
wrong
with
the
original
proxy
material,
just
in
order
to
avoid
the
delay
and
expense
of
this
litigation.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
well,
the
mutual
fund
must
seek
approval
of
its
fees.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
that's
correct.
what
i
said
is--
ms.
joan
m.
hall
--well,
if,
it
gives
the
shareholders
the
opportunity
to
vote
with
that
additional
information,
which
petitioner
claims
they
needed
to
have.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
right.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
and
it
obviates
the
need
for
a
lawsuit
on
a
proxy
claim.
now
in
this
case
petitioner
did
not
sue
until
6
months
after
the
shareholders'
meeting,
but
even
at
that
time
the
board
of
directors,
if
they
had
been
presented
with
a
demand
instead
of
a
complaint,
could
have
called
a
special
shareholders'
meeting
and
sent
out
revised
proxy
material
and
saved
themselves
the
expense
and
honor
of
appearing
before
the
supreme
court
on
this
issue
7
years
after
the
shareholders'
meeting.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joan
m.
hall
that's
correct.
your
honor,
petitioner
claims
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
revolutionary
decision.
we
think
that
it
was
more
evolutionary
and
in
the
tradition
of
the
common
law,
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
abolishing
the
futility
exception
will
help
to
preserve
the
viability
of
the
demand
requirement.
petitioner
basically
is
taking
the
view
that
no
corporate
director
ever
can
be
trusted
to
act
fairly
and
properly
in
considering
a
demand
requirement,
and
it
is
this
view
that
probably
explains
why
the
futility
exception
is
eroding
the
demand
requirement.
if
shareholder
plaintiffs
invariably
consider
corporate
directors
to
be
untrustworthy,
then
they
will
invariably
decide
that
a
demand
would
be
futile
and
they
will
always
rush
to
the
federal
courthouse
to
file
suit
without
making
a
demand.
the
inevitable
result
is
that
the
demand
requirement
is
eroded,
and
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
eliminates
supposed
futility
as
a
reason
for
not
making
a
demand
will
preserve
the
viability
of
the
demand
requirement
and,
we
suggest,
should
be
adopted
by
this
court.
the
allegations
of
futility
in
this
case,
your
honors,
were
totally
inadequate.
i
suggest
that
my
client
should
no
longer
be
required
to
defend
against
this
proxy
claim
where
the
allegations
of
futility
are
so
insufficient.
these
boilerplate
allegations
that
the
directors
received
fees
for
their
services
and
that
they
voted
to
send
out
the
challenged
proxy
material
would
not
constitute
futility
under
any
applicable
law.
and
this
proxy
claim
should
be
dismissed,
your
honors,
whether
this
court
chooses
to
apply
federal
law
or
state
law,
whether
you
choose
to
apply
the
futility
exception
or
abolish
the
futility
exception.
your
honor,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
dismissal
of
the
proxy
claim
in
this
case
be
affirmed.
