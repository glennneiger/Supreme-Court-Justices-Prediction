justice
scalia
excuse
me
there.
it
has
been
proposed
by
several
respected
organizations,
such
as
the
american
bar
association,
i
gather,
and
the
american
law
institute.
justice
scalia
it
goes
along
with
this.
does
the
american
law
institute,
like
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
here,
also
say
that
the
business
judgment
rule
would
not
be
applied
to
the
determination
of
the
directors?
justice
scalia
but
mr.
meyer,
excuse
me.
i
thought
the
seventh
circuit
had
explicitly
repudiated
imposing
upon
the
disappointed
would-be
plaintiff
that
kind
of
a
burden.
i
thought
what
the
seventh
circuit
is
saying
is
in
exchange
for
always
requiring
a
request
to
be
made
we
will
not
impose
the
normal
business
judgment
rule.
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
seventh
circuit
went
through...
i
don't
know
where
it
is
in
the
opinion.
oh,
yes,
on
13a
of
the
petition
for
cert.
we
seem
to
be
dealing
with
13a
and
14a
today.
the
opinion
gives
four
reasons
why
demand
may
be
inappropriate,
and
it
went
through
the
bases,
possible
bases
for
requiring
demand,
and
only
one
of
which
is
what
you
have
just
addressed.
another
purpose
of
it
is
to
let
the
corporation
take
over
the
suit
if
it
wishes.
now,
that
purpose
would
be
fully
served
whether
or
not
you
apply
the
business
judgment
rule.
justice
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i
understood
the
seventh
circuit
to
avoid
that
problem
by
federalizing
the
latter
question
as
well,
that
is
by
saying
how
much
deference
you
give
to
the
board
decision
is
also
a
federal
question,
and
we
will
not
adopt
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
the
business
judgment
rule.
justice
scalia
well...
gee,
i...
see,
i
didn't
understand.
justice
scalia
16
and
17?
justice
scalia
what
page
was
that
on?
justice
scalia
mrs.
hall,
i'm
having
trouble
finding
what
you're...
even
a16.
i
have
a--
--i
think
if
you
say
6a,
ms.
hall,
you'll
get
to
the--
justice
scalia
well,
but
they
do.
but
for
quite
separate
reason
that
you
always
have
to
make
a
demand.
that's
how
i
interpreted
that.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see...
it
isn't
necessarily
alternative.
then
they
go,
he
goes
on
to
explain
why
we
do,
and
the
reason
we
do
is
that
you
always
have
to
make
a
demand,
and
therefore
these
allegations
are
not
sufficient
to
excuse
a
demand.
isn't
that
the--
justice
scalia
it
may
well
be
that
even
though
you
do
come
full
circle,
i
suppose,
and
have
to
confront
the
same
state
law
issues,
you
may
not
have
to
do
it
in
as
many
cases.
justice
scalia
in
some
of
the
cases,
presumably,
the
corporation
will
decide
to
take
up
the
cudgels
on
behalf
of
the
shareholder.
justice
scalia
but
where
those
options
do
fail,
you
really
don't
have
any
answer
to
the
sg's
argument
that
you
may
have
to
get
into
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
that
we
have
up
to
now
been
conducting
or
the
courts
have
been
conducting
under
the
futility
rubric.
