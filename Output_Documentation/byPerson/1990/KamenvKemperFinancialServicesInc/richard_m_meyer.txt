mr.
richard
m.
meyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
action
was
brought
by
a
shareholder
of
cash
equivalent
fund
to
recover
damages
for
two
wrongs.
the
one
at
issue
before
the
court
today
is
a
proxy
violation,
the
deception
of
the
fund
shareholders
by
a
proxy
statement
which
induced
them
to
approve
a
management
agreement
with
the
investment
advisor,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
kfs,
by
misrepresenting
comparative
fees
paid
to
kfs
by
other
mutual
funds
managed
by
kfs.
that
misrepresentation
was
in
violation
of
rules
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
the--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--we
are
seeking
damages,
and--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--we
ask
that
the
damages
be
paid
to
the
fund.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
to
cash
equivalent
fund,
which
is
the
mutual
fund
involved.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
this
is
a
matter
which
the
solicitor
general
takes--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--a
somewhat
different
view
of.
we
have
always
taken
the
view
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
derivative
action,
yes.
this...
the
matter
now
before
the
court
requires
the
review
of
an
unprecedented
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that
the
claim
must
be
dismissed--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--seventh
circuit.
i
beg
your
pardon.
that
the
claim
must
be
dismissed
because
a
plaintiff
must,
prior
to
bringing
the
action,
in
all
cases,
make
a
precomplaint
demand
upon
the
board
of
directors
to
bring
the
action,
even
if
such
a
demand
would
be
futile.
i
propose
to
discuss
this
morning
three
questions.
first,
whether
a
demand
must
be
made
even
though
futile.
second,
the
practical
consequences
of
requiring
a
precomplaint
demand.
and
finally,
the
question
of
what
law
applies.
on
the
first
question,
whether
a
demand
must
be
made
even
if
futile--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--i
agree--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--i
am
going
to
say
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that's
correct.
and
the
order,
i
agree,
justice
white,
does
suggest
that
it
is
presented
in
inverse
order,
but
i
believe
that
you
will
see,
as
the
argument
unfolds,
the
conclusions
become
compelling.
at
least
i
hope
they
will
become
compelling.
beginning
with
the
question
of
making
a
demand
when
it
is
futile,
it's
an
ancient
precept
of
the
common
law
that
the
law
does
not
require
a
futile
act.
and
that
precept
has
been
applied
to
demand
on
directors
by
this
court
in
cases
going
back
well
over
100
years.
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
is
the
only
judicial
decision
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
or
that
has
been
cited
by
any
party
suggesting
that
even
though
the
demand
is
futile
it
must
nevertheless
be
made.
these
futility--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--the
american
law
institute
and
the
american
bar
association
have
adopted...
taking
the
american
law
institute,
which
has
been
a
little
more
active
in
the
area,
a...
what
they
call
a
tentative
draft,
which
is,
i
think
they
are
now
up
to
tentative
draft
number
10,
which
suggests
what
is
called
the
universal
demand
requirement.
that
is,
demand
may
be
made
in
every
case,
and
that
this
will
obviate
the
difficulty
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
demand
is
in
fact
futile.
it
will
compel
a
demand.
and
indeed
this
is
somewhat
in
line
with
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
cites
at
some
length
the
tentative
draft
of
the
american
law
institute.
the
basic...
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
the...
no,
i
don't
believe
they
say
that.
on
the
contrary,
the
basic
rationale
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
that
the
introduction
of
a
universal
demand
requirement
is
suggested
by
the
recent
developments
in
the
growth
of
special
litigation
committees.
even
where,
as
in
the
present
case,
the
board
of
directors
is
directly
implicated
in
the
wrong,
the
court
below
says
the
board
can
create
a
special
litigation
committee
by...
perhaps
by
expanding
its
number,
bringing
in
people
who
were
not
involved
in
the
wrongdoing.
these
committees
supposedly
will
dispassionately
review
the
facts
of
the
matter,
make
a
recommendation
to
the
board
of
directors,
and
the
board
will
act
accordingly.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
that
is
a
question--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--that
is
a
question
that
has
not
been
answered.
and
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--i
understand
it
in
the
following
way,
that
assuming
that
a
special
litigation
committee
is
formed
and
makes
a
recommendation,
which
invariably
is
a
recommendation
that
the
litigation
not
go
forward,
that's
invariably
the
case--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--all
right.
the
question
then
becomes
one
of
reviewing
the
determination
of
the
special
litigation
committee,
and
the
focus
of
the
litigation
has
now
changed.
we
are
now
looking
to
see
not
whether
the
original
complained
of
conduct
was
inappropriate.
we're
not
looking
to
see
whether
a
fiduciary
accused
of
self-dealing
has
satisfied
the
fiduciary's
normal
burden
of
justifying
the
intrinsic
fairness
of
his
dealings
with
his
corporation.
we
are
looking
instead
to
see
whether
an
independent
committee
(a)
had
some
kind
of
bias
or
conflict
of
interest,
and
(b)
whether
it
exercised
a
judgment
that
was
so
egregious
that
no
reasonable
businessman
could
be
said
to
have
come
to
a
similar
judgment.
this
is
such
an
enormous
burden
to
place
upon
a
shareholder
who
is,
in
this
particular
case
and
in
many
of
these
cases,
attempting
to
enforce
the
public
policies,
important
public
policies--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit
that
the
plaintiff
has
an
impossible
row
to
hoe.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
yes.
the
burden
of
reviewing...
the
burden
that
the
plaintiff
has
where
a
demand
is
made
and
turned
down
is
virtually
insuperable.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
the
futility
exception
is
the
one
that
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
for
well
over
100
years
and
by
every
court
that
has
ever
passed
upon
the
question.
the--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--at
one
point
in
its
opinion
the
seventh
circuit
does
suggest
that.
at
other
points
in
its
opinion
it
suggests
quite
the
contrary.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
the
first
suggestion
made
by
the
seventh
circuit,
i
don't
know
if
it
comes
in
that
order,
but
in
our
discourse
it's
the
first
suggestion,
is
an
illogical
suggestion
to
follow.
after
all,
why
go
to
the
trouble
of
forming
a
special
litigation
committee,
having
it
go
through
an
extensive
investigation,
hiring
counsel,
making
a
report,
and
then
coming
back
to
court
and
the
court
saying
we're
going
to
totally
ignore
it.
we'll
pretend
it
hasn't
occurred,
and
we
will
review
the
bringing
of
the
litigation
as
though
it
didn't
exist.
manifestly
it
must
have
some
purpose,
and
manifestly
if
these
special
litigation
committees
are
to
exist,
which
ineluctably
follows
from
the
imposition
of
a
universal
demand
requirement,
then
the
courts
must
give
some
deference
to
the
recommendations
of
special
litigation.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
demand
may
not
be
futile.
in
this
case,
clearly
demand
was
futile.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
arguments
that
even
where
it
is
futile
some
good
may
nevertheless
come
out
of
making
a
demand
is
not
really
an
appropriate
consideration
for
courts
to
consider.
for
example,
in
the
fox
case
which
is
oft
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
demand
would
be
futile
because
under
the
statute
the
corporation
was
disabled
from
bringing
the
claim.
and
that's
a
little
bit
different
from
what
we
have
here.
but
in
that
case
the
petitioner
argued
that
even
though
the
corporation
could
not
bring
the
claim...
it
also
involved
a
mutual
fund...
demand
would
serve
many
useful
intra-corporate
purposes.
it
would
cause
the
directors
to
focus
on
the
contract
with
the
investment
advisor.
they
might
revise
the
contract.
they
might
even
fire
the
investment
advisor.
all
other
intra-corporate
rearrangements
could
be
made.
that's
always
true,
but
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are,
while
undoubtedly
having
some
effect
on
corporate
governments,
are
really
directed
toward
corporate
litigation
and
not
with
the
operation
of
corporate
law
internally.
and
therefore
i
don't
subscribe,
obviously,
to
the
seventh
circuit's
views
on
this
matter.
the
third
point
that
i
want
to
talk
to,
and
i
would
like
to
address
this
as
briefly
as
possible
because
i
do
want
to
reserve,
if
permitted,
some
time
for
rebuttal.
the
third
point
i
want
to
address
is
what
law
applies
to
the
case.
our
view
is
that
state
law
should
apply
to
the
case,
in
this
case
maryland
law,
unless
that
state
law
is
so
inconsistent
with
the
enforcement
of
the
important
federal
public
policies
underlying
the
proxy
rules,
in
this
case
section
20
of
the
investment
company
act,
that
to
insist
upon
the
enforcement
of
the
rule
and
impose
burdens
upon
plaintiffs
seeking
to
enforce
that
public
policy
would
thwart
the
public
policy.
this
may
sound
like
a
heads,
i
win,
tails,
you
lose
proposition,
but
it's...
there
is
support
for
it
in
the
cases.
galef
v.
alexander,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
is
on
point.
we
also
mention
levitt
v.
johnson.
and
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--these
are
appellate
courts,
circuit
courts.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
federal
courts
of
appeal.
there
is
a
decision
by
this
court
in
boil
v.
united
technologies
which
did
indicate
that
federal
common
law
would
prevail
where
state
tort
law
would
threaten
a
result
that
was
contrary
to
what
was
involved
in
that
case,
the
government
defense
contractor
defense.
unless
there
are
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
be
very
brief.
hopefully
i
won't
need
to
use
the
3
minutes.
at
the
risk
of
helping
my
opponent,
i
believe
ms.
hall
intended
to
have
reference
to
page
17a
of
the
appendix
with
respect
to
the
discussion
of
futility,
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page.
i
won't
take
time
to
read
it,
but
i
think
if
your
honors
read
it
you
will
see
that
the
court
below
says
both
things.
and
it's
pretty
clear
that
it
can't
make
up
its
mind
whether
the
allegations
are
sufficient
to
establish
futility
or
not,
and
therefore
adopts
a
rule
saying
whether
or
not
futile
we
must
insist
on
demand
in
all
cases.
i
should
have
referred
before
to
the
borak
case
as
a
case
which
insists
on
applying
the
federal
standards
no
matter...
to
proxy
fraud
case
no
matter
what
state
law
would
apply,
and
i
submit
that
on
that
reasoning,
which
was
adopted
in
galef
subsequent
to
the
burks
decision,
burks
is
clearly
distinguishable.
burks
was
that
unusual
type
of
derivative
action
that
really
was
a
business
judgment
case.
there
was
no
self-dealing
involved
in
burks
at
all.
that
was
a
question
of
whether
management
made
a
business
judgment
mistake
in
purchasing
penn
central
commercial
paper
from
goldman
sachs.
and
in
fact
prior
to
the
decision,
i
think,
management
had
instituted
an
action
against
goldman
sachs
and
effected
a
recovery.
the
only
other
point
i
might
make
is
that
on
this
question
of
waiver
of
state
law,
the
state
law
question
was
never
really
waived.
it
was
never
really
raised
by
either
party.
we
said
in
our
initial
complaint,
we
hadn't
really
made
any
demand
allegations
except
with
respect
to
36b.
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
we
amended
the
complaint,
added
the
demand
allegations,
and
addressed
the
argument
of
the
defendants
by
saying
we
now
have
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
excuse
demand,
that
it's
not
merely
a
question,
as
you
know
from
having
read
the
papers,
of
the
fact
that
they
got
paid
for
being
directors.
that
would
be
simplistic.
basically
those
are
the
points
that
i
wanted
to
raise
on
rebuttal,
and
unless
the
court
has
questions
i
thank
you
very
much.
