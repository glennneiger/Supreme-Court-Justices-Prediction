chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-516,
jill
s.
kamen
v.
kemper
financial
services.
spectators
are
admonished
the
court
remains
in
session.
there
is
to
be
no
talking
in
the
courtroom
until
you
get
out
beyond
the
walls
here.
mr.
meyer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
the
legal
issue
changes,
as
i
understand
you,
mr.
meyer?
the
plaintiff
has
a
harder
row
to
hoe
if
a
demand
is
made
and
turned
down
than
if
the
plaintiff
can
simply
show
that
a
demand
would
be
futile?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
could
you
answer
my
question?
i
asked
you
to
compare
two
burdens.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
futility
exception
really
gives
the
plaintiff
a
leg
up,
then.
it
allows
it
to
litigate
under
different
standards
than
if
its
demand
is
turned
down?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where...
what
courts
decided
these
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
federal
courts
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
meyer.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
would
it
obstruct
them
if
you
can
do
pretty
much
what
you
want
in
the
way
of
prosecuting
your
suit
after
a
demand
is
turned
down?
wouldn't
it
simplify
things?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
might
not
the
states
change
some
of
their
laws
if...
in
that
regard,
if
a
demand
under
this
statute
were
treated
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
you
say
you
require
it
in
every
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
whole
statute
is
a
federal
statute.
i
mean,
it
specifies
for
what
the
basis
of
suit
is.
it's
not
as
if
you're
suing
under
a
state
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mrs.
hall,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
hall,
more
precisely,
what
exactly
was
the
question
decided
in
burks
what...
as
to
what
the
directors
could
do?
was
it
whether
they
should,
would
prosecute
litigation
or
whether
they
would
terminate
a
shareholder's
prosecution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
brought
by
whom?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
the
shareholder.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
hall--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--your
opposing
counsel
says
that
the
demand
requirement
is
not
just
kind
of
a
mechanical
thing
where
you
can
abolish
it
and
then
everything
will
come
out
all
right...
come
out
the
same
way,
and
then...
but
the
substantive
standard
of
review
of
the
shareholders'
claim
is
much
different
under
the
law
of
most
states
where
demand
has
been
made
and
refused
than
it
is
where
it
is
shown
to
be
futile.
do
you
agree
with
that
statement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
hall.
mr.
meyer,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
meyer.
the
case
is
submitted.
