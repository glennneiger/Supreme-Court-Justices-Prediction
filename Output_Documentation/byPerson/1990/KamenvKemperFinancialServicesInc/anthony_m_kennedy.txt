justice
kennedy
--portion
of
the
appendix
where
the
"as
do
we"
language
is
found.
justice
kennedy
but
i
take
it
the
solicitor
general's
point
is
that
that
just
brings
us
around
to
where
we
began,
because
delaware's
law
is
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
two
types
of
situations,
one
where
there
is
demand
and
one
where
there
is
demand
excused.
and
the
reason
that
delaware
can
afford
to
be
very...
to
give
great
deference
to
its
directors
in
the
demand
required
case
is
because
there
are
whole
other
class
of
cases
where
demand
is
excused
and
the
suits
can
then
go
forward
without
that
deference.
so
you're
really
asking
us
to
apply
a
state
law
which
has
not
at
all
been
developed
for
the
contingency
of
demand
being
required
in
every
case.
that
is
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
am
suggesting,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
i
believe,
that
it's
necessarily
involved
because
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
standard
that
might
be
completely
unworkable.
justice
kennedy
but
that
law
provides
either
no
answer
or
an
answer
that
is
quite
incorrect
because
it
is
premised
on
a
false
assumption.
