justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
other
case,
kamen
versus
kemper
financial
services
incorporated,
no.
90-516,
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
a
shareholder
derivative
action,
the
plaintiff
typically
must
make
a
demand
on
the
board
of
directors
before
bringing
suit.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
common
law
recognizes
a
futility
exception
in
this
requirement
in
a
derivative
action
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
court
in
such
a
suit
must
apply
the
futility
exception
as
defined
by
state
law.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
