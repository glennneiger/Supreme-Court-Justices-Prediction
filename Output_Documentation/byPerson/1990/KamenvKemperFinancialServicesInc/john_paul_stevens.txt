stevens
mr.
meyer,
can
i
just
ask
one
question?
what
remedy
do
you
seek
for
that
violation?
justice
stevens
and
who
is
the
we?
to
whom
would
the
damages
be
paid?
justice
stevens
to--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
so
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
derivative
action,
then?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
stevens
ms.
hall,
you
may
be
dead
right
that
the
allegations
are
insufficient,
but
neither
the
court
of
appeals...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rely
on
that
ground,
did
it?
justice
stevens
but
the
questions
presented
by
the
cert.
petition
don't
raise
that.
i
thought
we
took
a
case
assuming
that
there
were
sufficient
allegations.
you
may
be
right,
but
i'm
just
saying
i'm
not
sure
that's
one
of
the
issues
we're
addressing
under
the
cert.
petition.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
can
we
say
that's
all...
well,
that's
an
alternative
holding
rather
than
dicta,
then?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
here
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
justice
stevens
on
the
review...
i
know
you
say
it's
not
before
us
now--
justice
stevens
--but
do
you
have
the
position
there
that
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
stevens
but
then
why
doesn't
your,
why
wasn't
your
uniformity
argument
apply
equally
to
that?
justice
stevens
because
that,
in
last
analysis
that's
a
question
of
access
to
the
courts.
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
mrs.
hall?
justice
stevens
you're
saying...
one
of
your
arguments
is
you'll
save
a
lot
of
skirmish...
time
skirmishing
about
futility
if
you
have
an
automatic
demand
rule.
but
basically
the...
when
you
allege
futility
you're
alleging
that
the
decision
makers
are
biased
for
one
reason
or
another,
they're
beholden
or
they've
got
a
financial
interest.
is
it
not
true
that
if
you
call
for
a
demand
in
every
case
the
plaintiff
will
still
make
the
same
charges?
won't
he
say
you
can't
rely
on
this
decision
not
to
litigate
because
the
decision
makers
are
biased?
so
don't
you
get
back
to
the
same
issue
that
you,
as
when
you
have
a
futility
requirement?
justice
stevens
but
even...
that's
not
impossible
after
a
complaint
is
filed
either.
justice
stevens
maybe
we
need
more
reasonable
lawyers
on
both
sides
is
what
we
need.
there's
no
reason
why
that
has
to
be
true.
justice
stevens
yeah,
okay.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
that
wouldn't
have
done
any
good
because
they
have
already
hired
the
investment
advisor.
it's
already
been
approved.
sending
out
a
subsequent
proxy
statement
wouldn't
cure,
assuming
the
original
hiring
was
incorrect.
justice
stevens
right.
and
the
hypothesis
we
have
here
is
that
they
used
an
incomplete
proxy
statement
to
get
approval
of
an
improper
investment
contract.
justice
stevens
and
if
later
on
you
send
out
a
corrected
proxy
statement,
what
good
does
that
do?
justice
stevens
it
gives
them
an
opportunity
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
effect?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
or
they
might
have
appointed
an
impartial
committee
to
resolve
the
question,
as
some
corporations
do,
i
suppose--
justice
stevens
--which
would
also
avoid
ever
having
to
confront
the
futility
question.
