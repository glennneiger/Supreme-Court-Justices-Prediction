justice
stevens
--ms.
berzon,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
tell
us
whether
insurance
is
available
to
the
company
against
this
perceived
risk
or,
if
so,
how
much
it
would
cost?
justice
stevens
did
they
defend
on
the
ground
of
potential
tort
liability?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
are
asking
for
a
judgment
in
your
favor
without
a
trial,
or
do
you
think
the
case
should
be
tried?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you
there.
how
often
does
this
happen?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
stevens
it
says
it
may
poison
some
fetus
some
time.
justice
stevens
right,
and
the
question
is,
can
you
reduce
the
lead
level
enough
so
you
can
avoid
that
risk
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases?
justice
stevens
the
answer...
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
how
many
cases
there
are,
how
many
women
work
in
the
factory,
or
what
the
history
has
been,
does
it?
justice
stevens
how
many
women?
justice
stevens
mr.
jaspan,
can
i
ask
this.
one
of
the
reasons
this
case
is
so
hard
is
because
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
there
seem
to
be
an
impossible...
an
impossible
hypothetical
such
as
the
one
you
pose.
would
you
comment
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
that
judge
easterbrook
argued
so...
strongly
about,
the
zero-risk
business?
if
there
is
any
risk,
no
matter
how
infinitesimal,
that
one
out
of
100,000
workers
might
get
this
very...
if
the
harm
does
arise,
it's
very
serious.
everybody
agrees
to
that.
what...
what
is
your
position
on
that?
is
it...
is
the
slightest
quantified
risk
enough
to
justify
your
policy?
justice
stevens
how
do
you...
how
do
we
decide
what's
enough?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
a
substantial
harm
when
it
occurs.
they
didn't...
they
did
not
concede,
as
i
understand
the
papers,
that
it
occurs
with
sufficient
frequency
to
be
considered
substantial
in
a
quantifiable
sense.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stevens
well,
how--
justice
stevens
--well,
i'm
still
concerned
about
it,
because
if
we
approve
the
result
of
this
case,
what
are
we
saying
about
the
frequency
that
would
cross
the
threshold?
one
in
a
million;
one
in
a
thousand;
one
in
ten?
justice
stevens
who
got
pregnant
but
no
evidence
that...
that
the
fetuses
were
harmed.
justice
stevens
right,
but
there
is
no
evidence--
justice
stevens
--there
is
no
evidence
that
their
children
were
harmed.
justice
stevens
one
of
them
was
not
a
totally
normal
child,
but
he
didn't
say
it
was
totally
attributable
to
this
cause,
did
he?
justice
stevens
well,
does
that
one
case...
identify
the
severity
of
the
danger
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
stevens
--mr.
jaspan,
is
lead
level
in
the
ambient
air
something
that
can
be
monitored
constantly,
like
temperature
or
humidity
or
something
like
that,
or
is
it
you
have
to--
justice
stevens
--but
you
don't
look...
you
can't
look
at
the
instrument
at
6:00
and
say
the
lead
level
has
now
reached
a
point
where
we've
got
to
get
out
of
the
plant
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
is
an
average
rather
than
a...
than
amount
at
a
fixed
point
in
time.
justice
stevens
i
see.
