against
johnson
controls.
in
this
case,
we
are
concerned
with
such
discrimination
alleged
to
be
violating
with
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
amended.

as
a
primary
ingredient
in

process,
occupational
exposure
to
the
lead
entails
health
risks
including
the
risk
of
harm
to
a
fetus
carried
by
a
female
employee.
eight
of
johnson

employees
became
pregnant
while
maintaining
blood
levels
exceeding
that
noted
by
the
occupational

administration
as
critical
for
a
worker
planning
to
have
a

petitioners
are
a
group
including
employees
affected
by
johnson
controls'
fetal
protection
policy.
they
filed
a
class
action
in
the
district
court
claiming
that
the
policy
was
sex
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
employer.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
it
held
that
the
proper
standard
for
evaluating
the
policy
was
the
business
necessity
inquiry
applied
by
other
circuits
and
that
the
employer's
fetal
protection
policy
was
reasonably
necessary
to
further
the
industrial
safety
concern
that
is
part
of
the
essence
of
the
employer's
business.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
tittle
vii
as
amended
by
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
forbids
sex-specific
fetal
protection
policies
by
excluding
women
with
child
bearing
capacity
from
lead-exposed
jobs.
this
employer's
policy
creates
a
facial
classification
based
on
gender.
its
policy
explicitly
classifies
on
the
basis
of
potential
for
pregnancy.
the
policy
is
not
neutral
because
it
does
not
apply
to
male
employees
in
the
same
way
as
it
applies
to
females,
despite
evidence
about
the
debilitating
effect
of
lead-exposure
on
the
male
reproductive
system.
the
language
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
provision
in
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
the
case
law,
all
prohibit
an
employer
from
discriminating
against
a
woman
because
of
her
capacity
to
become
pregnant
unless,
her
reproductive
potential
prevents
her
from
performing
the
duties
of
the
job.
so
far
as
appearance
from
this
record,
fertile
women
participate
in
the
manufacture
of
batteries
just
as
efficiently
as
anyone
else.
in
tittle
vii
as
amended
mandates
that
decisions
about
the
welfare
of
future
children
be
left
to
the
parents
rather
than
to
the
employers,
who
hire
those
parents
or
to
the
courts,
and
employer's
tort
liability
for
potential
fetal
injuries
and
its
increased
cause
due
to
fertile
women
in
the
work
place
do
not
require
a
different
result.
