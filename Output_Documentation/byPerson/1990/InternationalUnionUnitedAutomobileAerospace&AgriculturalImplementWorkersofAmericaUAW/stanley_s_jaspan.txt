mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
issue
in
this
case...
excuse
me...
is
whether
congress
intended
through
title
vii
to
require
an
employer
to
knowingly
expose
the
offspring
of
its
employees
to
a
toxic
substance
which
causes
permanent
harm
to
the
child's
developing
brain
and
central
nervous
system.
petitioners
claim
that
whenever
such
an
exclusion
treats
men
and
women
differently,
it
is,
per
se,
illegal.
however,
every
federal
court
of
appeals
to
have
addressed
the
issue,
along
with
the
eeoc,
and
now
the
united
states
as
amicus
in
this
case,
has
rejected
petitioners'
position.
neither
the
statutory
language,
nor
sound
public
policy,
supports
such
an
approach.
the
legal
issue
must
be
evaluated
in
this
case
against
one
overriding,
undisputed
fact:
exposure
of
the
fetus
to
the
lead
levels
regarded
as
safe
under
the
current
osha
lead
standard
poisons
the
fetus
and
causes
permanent
brain
damage.
every
expert
in
this
case--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--the
record
doesn't
give
specific--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--the
record
indicates,
your
honor,
that
the
studies,
epidemiological
studies
comparing
children
and
fetuses,
mothers
with...
the
cord
blood
of
the
mother...
with
different
levels
of
lead,
shows
that
an
increasing
quantity
of
lead
in
the
system
will
cause
deficiency
and
behavioral
disorders,
learning
disabilities
and
other
such
problems--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--and
the
answer--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--no,
the
record
does
show
that
the
company
attempted
a
voluntary
program.
approximately
1977
to
1982,
the
company
advised
women
of
the--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--the
exact
number
isn't
in
the
record.
there
is
in
evidence
in
the
record
from
a
uaw
affidavit
that
in
the
uaw
plants,
which
is
the
majority
of
the
plants,
2
years
later
there
were
275
women,
that
number.
that
would
not
totally
reflect
what
was
there
at
the
time
of
this
policy,
but
the
company
attempted
during
that
period
to
advise
women
of
the
dangers
and
indicated
to
them
that
if
there
was
any
chance
that
they
might
become
pregnant,
they
should
remove
themselves
from
high-lead
areas.
the
company
went
further,
and
had
each
woman
sign
a
statement
saying
that
she
understand
that
the
company
recommends
that
she
not
work
in
that
high-lead
area
if
she
might
become
pregnant.
the
total...
in
the
last
3-1/2
years
of
that
policy,
a
total
of
eight
women...
at
least
eight
women
became
pregnant
with
blood
leads
in
excess
of
30
micrograms,
the
level
set
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
as
the
level
at
which
lead
poisoning
occurs
in
a
small
child.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
that
it
was
an
unsafe
level.
it
would...
it's
not--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
think
congress
has
asked
the
district
courts
to
do
that
in
adopting
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
this
court--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--but
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
such
as
criswell
and
dothard,
in
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
field,
have
certainly
put
the
district
courts
in
that
position.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
osha,
as
the
statute
makes
clear,
sets
a
floor,
not
a
ceiling,
for
occupational
health.
the
osha
statute
encourages
voluntary
programs
beyond
the
actual
standards.
the
osha
lead
standard
itself,
adopted
in
1978,
required
part
of
the
standard
is
silent
as
to
fetal
health.
in
the
preamble
to
the
standard,
osha
says
that
we
have
not
adopted
a
separate
standard
for
women
because...
and
explains
that
silence.
it
specifically
finds,
as
the
experts
in
this
case
have
said,
that
a
fetus
exposed
to
lead,
blood
lead
above
30
micrograms,
is
in
danger
of
serious
permanent
injury
to
the
developing
central
nervous
system.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
let
me
address
both
issues--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--justice
o'connor.
as
to
the
pda,
ability
to
work
certainly
includes
the
ability
to
perform
a
job
safely
and
efficiently.
no
employer
goes
out
and
hires
employees
who
may
be
able
to
produce
the
product
in
some
rapid
fashion,
but
if
it
causes
injury
to
fellow
employees,
to
the
employee
who's
doing
the
work,
to
neighbors,
to
other
third
parties,
certainly
that
individual
does
not
have
the
ability
to
perform
the
job.
so
the
language
of
ability
to
perform
the
job,
as
expressed
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
certainly
includes
the
ability
to
perform
it
safely
as
well
as
efficiently.
we
think
when
congress
adopted
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
it
made
clear
that
the
existing
title
vii
analysis,
other
than
this
court's
decision
in
gilbert,
would
remain
in
effect;
that
all
defenses,
including
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense,
would
remain
available
to
an
employer
under
that
act.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
the
purpose
of
the
policy
is
to
protect
the
health
of
the
fetus.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
this
court
in
criswell
made
clear
that
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense
is
available
when
all,
or
substantially
all,
of
the
employees
cannot
perform
the
job
safely,
and
also
when
the
employer
is
unable
to
determine
which
employees
in
the
excluded
class
possess
the
trait
that
creates
the
safety
problem.
in
this
case,
the
employer
is
not
able
to
determine
which
employees
will
become
pregnant.
the
only
way
an
employer
could
attempt
to
do
so,
first
of
all
a
voluntary
program,
which
was
attempted
and
failed
in
this
company,
and
second
would
be
some
constant
monitoring
of
the
sex
lives
of
the
employees,
which
even
petitioners
agree
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
well,
justice
scalia,
with
all
due
respect,
i
disagree.
i
think
clearly
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
took
care
of
such
concerns
as
benefits,
it
took
care
of
such
concerns
that
were
raised
in
this
court's
gilbert
decision.
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
was
not
intended
to
overrule
the
other
defenses
and
the
existing
analysis
contained
in
title
vii,
the
legislative
history,
indicates
that
there's
nothing
in
the
language
that
indicates
otherwise.
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
is
an
amendment
to
the
definition
of
sex
discrimination.
it
certainly...
it
excludes
some
specific
affirmative
defenses
involving
the
equal
pay
act.
it
has
no
exclusion
in
its
language
for
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense.
to
take
such
an
approach
as
is
taken
by
petitioners
here
and
as
is
suggested
by
judge
easterbrook
in
effect
says
that
an
employer
can
never
exclude
a
woman
based
upon
her
pregnancy,
no
matter
how
dangerous
it
is
to
her
fetus,
that
that
woman
has
the
absolute
right.
because
the
legal
analysis
if
one
accepts
that
position
is
that
even...
for
example,
in
a
nuclear
power
plant
if
there
were
a
room
or
an...
a
specific
area
where
the
radiation
through
medical
evidence
is
clear
that
it's
safe
for
adults
and
not
for
the
fetus
and
you
have
a
woman
who
is
pregnant,
the
employer
under
that
analysis
would
be
precluded
from
denying
that
woman
that
position.
it
would
be
odd,
in
fact,
for
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
to
be
treated...
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
manner.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
was
fetal
health.
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
the
concern
for
fetal
health.
to
interpret
that
act
as
requiring
an
employer
to
knowingly
expose
the
offspring
of
its
employees
to
injury,
permanent
injury
to
the
central
nervous
system,
would
be
contrary
to
that
intent.
moreover,
that
same
pregnancy
discrimination
act
specifically
states
that
an
employer
shall
not
be
required
to
pay
for
an
abortion.
now,
if
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
the
employer
shouldn't
be
required
to
pay
for
an
abortion,
it
wasn't
also
saying
that
the
employer
should
be
required
to
injure
the
child.
i
think
that's
an
improper
interpretation
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
certainly
not
called
for
by
its
language
or
its
legislative
history.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
no,
it's
not,
and
we
haven't
suggested
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
i
think
in
this
case
there
was
no
reason
for
the
courts
to
address
it
because
the
parties
stipulated,
conceded
at
the
court
of
appeals...
it's
in
the
petitioners'
brief...
that
there
was
substantial
risk.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
i
believe
you're
wrong
on
that,
because
the
court,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
existing
case
law
from
the
fourth
and
eleventh
circuit.
they
talked
about
a
three-factor
test.
the
first
factor
was
substantial
risk
of
harm
to
the
offspring.
in
its
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
petitioners
said
we
do
not
challenge
that
harm.
the,
i
think,
specific
language
is
we
concede
that...
that
factor,
language
to
that
effect.
but
it
was
clear
there
was
no
discussion
of
that
factor.
that
was
never
developed
beyond
that.
it
wasn't
developed
at
the
district
court
level
because
all
the
experts
agreed
that
it's
substantial
risk.
and
the
question
of
frequency
simply
didn't
come
up
because
the
risk
was
so
great,
and
i
think
to
that
extent--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
think
that
their
concession
went
beyond
that.
so
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
it's
an
issue
that
really
has
to
be
addressed.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
a
court
in
evaluating
what
is
the
first
prong,
as
recognized
by
all
the
parties,
and
it's
recognized
by
the
lower
courts
that
have
addressed
the
issue,
must
determine
whether
the
risk
is
so
substantial
that
whether
it...
in
terms
of
the
severity
and
the
frequency
and
has
to
measure
both.
i
think
that's
consistent
with
tamiami
and
this
court's
direction
in
criswell.
in
this
case
there
were
two
factors
present
that...
why
it
was
not
addressed
more
fully.
one
was
the
voluntary
program.
it
wasn't
theoretical
here.
there
were
at
least
eight
women
in
a
3-1/2-year
period.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
no.
women
who
were
pregnant
with
blood
leads
at...
in
excess
of--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--30
milligrams.
there
were
additional
pregnancies--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--that's
not
true.
there
is
evidence,
the
testimony
of
dr.
fishburn
in
the
record
identifying
that
he
was
aware
on
at
least
one
of
those
where
there--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--and
what
he
did
say
is
we're
dealing
with
an...
epidemiological
studies
that
are
the
basis
for
the
entire
concern
with
childhood
lead,
is
that
if
a
child's
iq
is
reduced
by
10
or
20
points,
we
don't
know...
if
it's
reduced,
we
don't
know
what
it
would
have
been.
we
can't
prove
that
the
child
would
have
been
that
much
smarter
or
that
much
better
behaved
or
had
lesser
problems
in
school
if
he
didn't
have
this
permanent
damage.
that's
why
you
can't
prove
it
with
any
single
individual.
and
the
studies
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
experts,
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
are
the
epidemiological
studies
dealing
with
thousands
of
children.
we
must
remember
that
we're
dealing
in
this
case
with
such
a
severe
and
substantial
danger
that
the
centers
for
disease
control
in
19--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
don't
think
the
single
case
does.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
larger
studies,
such
that
the
centers
for
disease
control
in
1985
made
the
unequivocal
statement
that
women
of
childbearing
age
should
be
excluded
from
working
at
jobs
where
significant
lead
exposure
occurs.
it
was
an
unequivocal
statement
by
the
centers
for
disease
control,
and
the
basis
for
the
statement
was
their
study
or
restudy
of
the
dangers
and
the
problems
with
childhood
lead
poisoning.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
i
don't
know
the
exact
comparison,
your
honor,
but
there's
a
difference
here
between
the
government
prohibiting
it
and
insisting
that
a...
private
employer
do
it.
we
don't
provide
cigarettes
to
our
pregnant
employees
or
fertile
employees
or
any
other
employees.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
and
i...
i
agree
with
you
on
that
point.
however,
we
are
not
dealing
with
whether
the
government
puts
a
restriction
on
an
individual.
here,
we're
dealing
whether
an
employer,
a
manufacturer,
is
required
to
expose
the
individual,
to
expose
the
child.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
certainly.
i
think
the
employer
takes
the
position
that,
consistent
with
its
entire
health
and
safety
program,
that
it
won't
sell
cigarettes
to
anyone.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
could
it
single
out
pregnant
employees?
if
selling
cigarettes
were
part
of
its
normal
business
and--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--an
assumption
that's
not
true.
i
assume
they
could
do
so,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
facts
here.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
they
could
prohibit
that
sale,
and
i
think--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--and
that's
why
i
suggest
that.
[laughter]
but
it's
not
the
facts
here.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
question
of
occupational
health.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
employers,
manufacturers,
have
now
long
been
told
that
they
are
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
their
manufacturing
substances.
manufacturers
are
liable,
responsible
if
they
injure
their
employees,
they
injure
the
children
of
their
employees,
their
customers,
their
neighbors,
and
the
environment.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
it
arguably
should
be
a
defense.
however,
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense
doesn't
talk
about
the
employer
may
do
something
if
it's
required
to
do
it
by
law.
the
question
under
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense
is
whether
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation.
the
normal
operation
of
manufacturers
today
is
to
provide
for
the
health
and
safety
of
their
employees,
the
children
of
their
employees,
and
their
neighbors
and
other
third
parties.
the
issue
under
title
vii,
going
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
language,
is
what
is
the
normal
operation
of
the
employer.
to
suggest
that
normal
operation
does
not
include
concern
for
health
and
safety
would
certainly
be
a
strange
notion
to
most
manufacturers
today.
it
certainly
is
true
here.
you
have
a
manufacturer
who
for
years,
before
osha
and
beyond
what
osha
requires,
has
provided
extensive
health
and
safety
protection,
lead
protection,
to
its
employees
and
the
children
of
its
employees.
the
company
spends
substantial
sums
of
money
lowering
the
blood...
the
air
leads
in
the
plant
through
use
of
engineering
controls,
through
use
of
make-up
air
units,
through
ventilation
systems.
the
district
court
found,
and
it
was
unchallenged,
the
company
is
doing
all
it
can
to
clean
up
and
to
reduce
the
lead
exposure.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
company
is
saying
i'm
going
to
exclude
the
women
as
a
way
of
avoiding
cleaning
up
the
workplace.
this
is
a
clean
workplace.
but
the
acceptable
lead
levels
are
so
low
as
determined
by
the
various
agencies,
as
determined
by...
agreed
by
all
the
experts
here,
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
so,
and
that
was
a
finding
unchallenged
of
the
district
court.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
it's
monitored
on
an
individual...
on
an
8-hour
time-weighted
average
basis,
so
it
can
be
monitored
daily.
it
wouldn't
be
looking
at
a
particular
point
in
time--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--no.
typically,
it's
a
pump
that's
attached
to
the
individual
employee
or
stationary
pump
that
would
filter
air
through
it,
and
it
would
be...
it's
an
8-hour
time-weighted
average,
the
osha
lead
standard
for
air--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--yes.
that's
the
way
that
works.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
but
we're
dealing
not
only
with
the
engineering
controls
this
company
put
in
but
the
biological
monitoring.
employees
are
monitored
regularly.
they're
subject
to
medical
examinations,
blood
testing,
the
effects
of
lead.
they
also
get
paid
wash-up
time
and
work
clothing
provided
by
the
employer.
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
make
sure
the
lead
is
not
taken
home
with
the
employee
so
that
the
family
is
not
exposed.
this
fetal
protection
policy
is
not
a
policy
that
was
adopted
in
isolation
from
the
health
and
safety
concerns
of
this
employer.
on
the
contrary,
the
impetus
for
this
program
came...
exclusively
from
the
medical
consultants
of
the
company.
the
medical
consultants
unanimously
said,
look,
you're
doing
all
of
these
other
things,
you're
being
irresponsible
in
exposing
these
children
to
these
levels
of
lead.
now
osha
does
not
prohibit
that.
i
think
the...
that
issue
came
up
before.
osha
explained
that
the...
that
it
was
its
desire,
notwithstanding
the
silence
in
the
standard
itself,
to
have
all
children
or
fetuses
not
exposed
to
any
level
above
30
micrograms.
they
agreed
with
the
findings
on
which
this
study
is
based.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
i
think
the--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
talks
about
reasonably
necessary.
that
doesn't
provide
much
more
guidance
on
that.
but
i
think
what's
clear
from
this
court
in
criswell
is
that
it
becomes
a
case...
case-by-case
analysis.
what
clearly
must
be
shown
and
the
reason
why
the
abuse
that
seems
to
be
suggested
by
petitioners
that
might
occur
from
a
decision
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
simply
is
not
true
is
that
we're
dealing
with
sound
medical
evidence.
we're
not
dealing
with
stereotypes.
we're
not
dealing
with
situations--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
don't
think
that
we
can
put
a
precise
number.
i
think
what
has
to
be
measured
is
how
serious
is
the
deformity,
how
likely
it
is,
if
it's
one
in
a
million,
is
there
another
way
of
avoiding
it--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
think
that
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
specific
facts,
but
there's
no
percentage--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--well,
i
think
the
standards
we
should
talk
about
is
substantial
risk
and
whether
it's
reasonably
necessary
for
the
particular
operation
and
to
provide
the
safety--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
think
in
most
cases--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--i
don't
know
where
the
numbers
would
fall.
if--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--justice
scalia,
i
think
what
we'd
have
to
do
is
look
in
terms
of
the
individual
fact
situation.
it
was
suggested
in
petitioners'
brief
that
criswell
should
be
limited
to
mass
catastrophe,
and
it
comes
out
of
the
tamiami
case
of
the
fifth
circuit
suggesting
that
it
is
okay
if
there's
a
bus
accident
that
injures
10
or
20
people
and
that's...
criswell
formula
is
appropriate,
but
if
we're
dealing
with
an
injury
that
only
affects
5
or
10
children
it
may
not
be.
i
don't
think
we're
in
a
position
or
any
employer
is
in
a
position
or
should
be
in
a
position
to
make
the
decision
that
will
allow
5
serious
injuries
but
not
10.
i
think
the
tort
law
and
i
think
those
type
of
considerations,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
set
of
circumstances--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--that's
right,
and
i
think
in
this
case
we
are
so
far
beyond
where
that
line
should
be
drawn,
as
both
parties
conceded,
that
it's
not
an
issue
that
this
court
has
to
face
in
this
case,
and
it's
not
an
issue
that
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
needed
to
face
because
it
was
a
conceded
issue
here.
difficult
question,
i
totally
agree
with
you.
let
me
go
on
that
zero-risk
point
just
for
a
moment.
there
is
no
zero
risk.
the
studies
indicate
that
for
adults
generally
the
50-microgram
blood
lead
level
is
safe,
especially
if
the
effects,
individual
effects
are
monitored.
for
the
fetus,
we're
dealing
with
30
or
25
micrograms.
women
are
allowed
to
work
below
that.
it's
conceivable,
notwithstanding
the
likelihood
and
past
experience,
that
an...
accident
will
occur
and
the
blood
lead
of
an
individual
woman
who's
fertile
may
shoot
up.
it's
not
zero
risk
here.
we
do
exclude
men
and
unfertile
women
from
areas
as
well,
a
zero
risk,
because
the
osha
standard
imposes
those
risks
on
the
employer,
those
limits
on
the
employer.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
the
comparison
of
zero
risk
versus
in
one
case
and
not...
and
a
different
type
of
risk
in
another
case.
let
me
also
go
back
to
the
osha
standard
for
a
moment.
appendix
c
of
that
osha
standard
is
very
explicit.
it
assumes
that
company
physicians--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--it
is
referenced
in
the
brief.
it
is
referenced
in
the
brief.
it's
not
spelled
out
in
the
brief.
its
response--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--no.
it's
in...
it's
in
response
to
the
argument
that
osha
in
some
way
preempts
this
position
that
we're
taking
here.
appendix
c
assumes
broad
flexibility
by
a
company
physician
in
dealing
with
pregnancy
and
potential
pregnancy.
it
talks
about
explicitly...
the
osha's
appendix
talks
about
companies
going
beyond
what
the
osha
limit
requires.
it
encourages
that
particularly
in
dealing
with
pregnancy
and
potential
pregnancy.
the
department
of
labor
has
taken
the
position,
approved
by
one
court
of
appeals,
the
d.c.
circuit,
that
if
an
employer
knows
that
an
occupational...
an
osha
standard
is
insufficient
to
provide
adequate
protection,
the
employer
is
required
to
take
additional
steps.
here,
we
had
our
medical
consultants
telling
us
that
we
must
take
additional
steps.
the
department
of
labor
would
take
the
position
that
all
this
was
mandatory.
finally,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
in
there,
they
make
clear
that
as
far
as
the
u.s.,
the
united
states,
is
concerned,
the
1978
osha
conclusions
are
in
no
way
dispositive
of
this
case.
in
fact,
the
analysis
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
representing
the
eeoc
as
well
as
the
united
states
is
consistent
with
the
analysis
taken
by
the
company
here.
our
only
disagreement
with
that
brief
is
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
adequately
examined
the
issue
of
male
mediation.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could
not
come
to
an
unspeculative...
nonspeculative
decision
that
male
mediation
is
similar
to
the
female
mediation,
that
the
risks
to
the
offspring
of
the
male
employees
is
substantially
similar
to
the
risks
to
the
female,
the
offspring
of
female
employees.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
it's
not
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
issue
with
the
burden
on
the
employer.
we
think
it
is.
we
think
that's
an
issue
where
the
eeoc
possesses
no
special
expertise,
and
this
court
can
certainly
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
beyond
that,
though,
the
legal
analysis,
we're
in
agreement
with
the
solicitor
general
that
occupational
health--
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
--in
this
case
it
would
not
have
any
effect,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case
the
court
addressed
it
both
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
plaintiffs
under
their
interpretation
of
business
necessity
in
light
of
wards
cove
and
burden
of
proof
on
the
employer
in
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
and
on
this
particular
issue,
the
court
found
that
a
trier...
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could
not
come
to
a
nonspeculative
conclusion
that
the
risk
to...
through
the
male
to
the
offspring
was
similar
to
that
to
the
female.
mr.
stanley
s.
jaspan
in
either
case,
because
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could
not
come
to
that...
that
conclusion,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
where
the
burden
is.
but
they
did
look
at
it
both
ways,
and
they
looked
at
it
both
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
plaintiff
and
the
burden
on
the
defendant.
that's
where
the
solicitor
general
claims
that
it's
not
sufficiently
clear,
and
his
suggestion
is
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
purpose.
we
don't
think
that
purpose
exists.
but,
beyond
that,
the
interpretation
given
the
statute...
consistently
given
the
statute,
by
the
way...
by
the
eeoc
that
such
policies
as
this
are
permissible
is
the
appropriate
one
and
is
consistent
with
the
case
law
as
previously
set
down
by
this
court.
in
price
waterhouse
this
court
indicated
that
we're
not
to
leave
common
sense
at
the
doorstep
when
interpreting
title
vii.
it
would
violate
common
sense
and
the
overriding
interest
in
occupational
health
and
safety
to
require
an
employer
to
damage
unborn
children.
johnson's
policy,
part
of
a
longstanding
policy
of
concern
for
the
health
and
safety
of
its
employees,
strikes
the
appropriate
balance.
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
balancing,
as
required
by
price
waterhouse,
the
interests
involved
of
the
employer,
the
employee
and
the
woman.
an
employer,
a
manufacturer
that
creates
a
hazard,
has
an
obligation
to
protect
against
injury
from
that
hazard.
the
employer
here
is
simply
exercising
its...
its
obligations
and
its
rights
consistent
with
its
normal
operations
as
permitted
by
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense.
that's
what's
at
stake
here.
thank
you.
