justice
scalia
ms.
berzon,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
as
i
understand
your
position,
that's
true,
and...
and...
and
i
suppose
that
could
be
one
basis
on
which
we
decided
this
case.
but...
but
your
position
really
is
that
it
wouldn't
matter
if
the
policy
were
limited
to
women
who
actually
were
pregnant.
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't
matter
for
your
analysis
if
the
policy
said
a
pregnant
woman
may
not
work
in
this
unit.
justice
scalia
indeed,
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
said
a
woman
more
than...
more
than
4
months
pregnant
or
6
months
pregnant
would
not
work?
justice
scalia
the
position
that
judge
easterbrook
took
in
the--
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
other...
other...
other
disabilities,
temporary
disabilities,
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
pregnancy
act
which
was
adopted.
i
mean,
doesn't
that
reflect
a
congressional
determination
that
that
particular
disability,
if
you
want
to
consider
it
that,
is
not
to
be
the
basis
of...
of
special
treatment?
justice
scalia
unlike
that
of--
justice
scalia
--but
it's
special
treatment
with
respect
to
all
other
workers
who
don't
have
that
particular
disability,
if
you
consider
it
a
disability,
right?
and
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
pregnancy
act
was
to
prevent
precisely
that,
to
treat--
justice
scalia
well,
they'd
know
which
woman
was
pregnant
and
which
not
pregnant
as
soon
as
she--
justice
scalia
--well,
eventually,
but
not...
not...
not
too
much.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
how
does
that
come
within
osha's
charter?
i
don't...
i'm
just
not
familiar
with
enough...
i
thought
osha
set
standards
for...
for
levels
of
toxic
substances
in
the
workplace.
does
it
also
prescribe
who
may
be
allowed
in
the
workplace
and
who
may
not?
justice
scalia
ms.
berzon,
this
is
tied
into
that.
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me
about...
about
the
case
is
that
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
that
congress
is
going
to
adopt
a
standard
that
whipsawed
the...
the
employer,
that
put
him
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
that
is
to
say,
if
he
allows
the
women
to
take
the
jobs
he
is
subject
to
enormous
suits
for
damages,
and
maybe
even
punitive
damages,
if
the
child
is
born
deformed,
and
if
he
doesn't
he's
punished
under
title
vii.
does
the
osha
law...
ruling
that
you
just
spoke
of
in
your
view
prevent
state
damage
suits
by
the
child
when
the
child
is
born
deformed,
against
the
employer
for--
justice
scalia
--i
don't
think
that's
how
the
suit
would...
would
be
framed.
i
think
the
suit
would
be
framed
saying
that
he
was
negligent
in
not
reducing
the
lead
level
even
further
so
that
it
would...
would
have
been
safe
for
even
pregnant
women.
that's
how
the
suit
would
be
formulated,
i
think.
now,
would
osha
preempt
that?
justice
scalia
would
osha
preempt
the
state
from
establishing
as
a
rule
of
tort
law
that
you
were
negligent
in
not
reducing
your
lead
level
even
further?
justice
scalia
you'd
allow
recovery
against
the
mother
who...
who
put
the
fetus
in
that
position,
i
presume?
justice
scalia
may
occur,
or
always
occurs?
justice
scalia
well,
why
doesn't
osha
consider
it
an
unsafe
level?
why
doesn't
osha
require
a
higher...
a
lower
level,
or
require
pregnant
women
to
be
excluded?
i
mean,
i'm
a
little
troubled
by
the
notion
that
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
evaluate
all
these
medical
experts
on
its
own.
usually,
when
you're
reviewing
osha,
you...
it's
easy
for
a
district
judge
and
for
the
appellate
court
on
review
to
say
whether...
whether
it
seems
reasonable,
what
osha
has
done,
given
all
the
expert
evidence.
but
you're
asking
district
courts
to
figure
out
whether...
you
know,
such
questions
as
what
the
safe
level
is,
and
whether...
whether
males
are
subject
to
exactly
the
same
risk.
i
don't
think
we're
very
good
at
that.
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--maybe
if
we
accept
your
interpretation
of
it,
congress
has,
but
one
thing
that
makes
me
reluctant
to
accept
your
interpretation
is
that
very
fact,
that
it
puts
us
in
a
very
unusual
position
of
becoming
medical
experts
on
some
very
difficult
questions.
justice
scalia
well,
what
about
osha?
why
wouldn't
osha...
if
what
you
say
is
true,
how
do
you
explain
osha's
rule?
justice
scalia
mr.
jaspan,
in
interpreting
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
as
you
just
have,
that
is,
as
making
an
exception,
or
considering
it
part
of
the
job
qualification
that
you
not
harm
the
fetus'
health...
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
a
dead
letter
of
it.
that
was
always
the
justification
used
for
discriminating
against
pregnant
women,
that
they
shouldn't
work
extra
long
hours
because
it
would
be
bad
for
the
fetus.
i
mean,
to...
to...
to
continue
to
allow
that
exception
is
to
make
a
farce
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
what...
what
other
bases
of
treating
pregnant
women
specially
were
there,
except
that?
it's
bad
for
the
child.
you're...
you're
making
it
a
ridiculous
piece
of
legislation.
justice
scalia
well,
they...
they
should...
women...
women
in
that
condition
should
not
smoke
cigarettes
and
drink
substantial
amounts
of
alcohol,
either,
but
the
government
does
not
have
laws
that
take
the
judgment
of
whether
to
do
it
or
not
away
from
them.
and
do
you
know
how
this
risk
compares
to
the
risk
of
harm
to
the
fetus
from
heavy
smoking?
justice
scalia
or
make
an
exception
from
the
employers...
from
the
prohibition
of
the
employers
otherwise
controlling
the...
the
lives
of
the
employees
by
prohibiting
them
from
employment.
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
an
exception
to
the
general
rule.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
government
has
not
shown
in
other
indications
an
unwillingness
to
leave
the
health
of
the
fetus
up
to
the
judgment
of
the
mother,
including
situations
where
the
fetus
might
be
placed
at
substantial
risk,
maybe
greater
risk
than
would
occur
from
lead
poisoning.
justice
scalia
surely
not
if
the
government
made
them
do
it.
isn't...
isn't
the
government
made
me
do
it
always
a
good
defense?
i
thought
we,
you
know--
justice
scalia
mr.
jaspan,
suppose
we
agree
with
your
theory.
how
does
the
court
go
about
determining
what
level
of
protection
for
fetuses
is
enough?
i'm
not
concerned
about
this
case.
you
answered
that
for
this
case
by
saying
here
it's
conceded
that
it
was
a
substantial
risk.
but
in...
in
another
case,
suppose
you
have
an
employer
who
says
i
am
so
concerned
for
fetal
health
i
don't
want
any
risk,
i
want
zero
risk.
and
he
can
show
that,
you
know,
that...
that
there
is
a
very,
very
tiny
risk.
justice
scalia
the
workplace
is
full
of
risks.
what...
how
is
a
court
to
determine
how
careful
the
employer
may
be
without
violating
title
vii?
justice
scalia
this
doesn't
sound...
i'm
not
talking
about
the
medical
evidence.
i'm
talking
about
how
many
deformities
is
worth
letting
women
work
in
the
department.
how
many
is
worth
it?
let's
assume
the
medical
evidence
is
uncontradicted.
there
will
be
one
in
a
million.
is
that
too
many?
justice
scalia
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
how
courts
are
going
to
manage
this...
this
rule
that
you're
urging
us
to
take
onto
ourselves.
how
are
we
to
determine
what
the
proper
balance
of
risk
to
fetus
and
freedom
for
the
women
to
work
in
the
marketplace
is?
justice
scalia
well,
i
know
that,
but
i
don't
know
what
standards
we
apply.
i
don't
know--
justice
scalia
--it
has
to
be
substantial
risk?
justice
scalia
so
one...
one
in
a
million
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
scalia
i
see.
so
long
as
you
can
put
the
label
substantial
on
it,
you're
sure
what
the
answer
is?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
he
has
to
make
those
decisions.
justice
scalia
does
this
appear
in
the...
in
the
materials
that
we
have
here?
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
scalia
it's
not
set
forth
anywhere
in
any
of
the
papers?
justice
scalia
of
course,
on
what
you...
on
the
basis
of
what
you've
just...
we
would
have
a
different
case,
in
other
words,
if
the
employer
adopted
a
different
policy
which
simply
said
as
soon
as...
as
soon
as
you
are
pregnant
you
are
out
of
this
job?
