justice
kennedy
--are
you
saying
that
there
would
be
reasonable
nondiscriminatory
alternatives
that
would
be
much
easier
to
identify
if
it
were
a
policy
that
applied
just
to
people
that
were
pregnant?
justice
kennedy
--ms.
berzon,
i
have
only
one
factual
question,
and
maybe
the
record
doesn't
disclose
it.
does
the
record
indicate
how
long
unacceptable
lead
levels
remain
in
the
bloodstream--
justice
kennedy
--or
do
we
know
much
about
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
on
the
first
part
of
the
equation,
how
many
months
are
the
estimates
for
the
removal
of
the...
of
the
contaminant?
justice
kennedy
excuse
me.
that
last
argument
would
apply,
as
well,
to
a
pregnancy-limited
rule
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
it's
bizarre
to
assume
that
a
state
court
in
a
tort
suit
would
impose
very
severe
liability
on
an
employer
for
knowingly
placing
the
woman
in
the
position
where
the
fetus
is
injured
if
the
fetus
is
actually
injured.
if
we
can
assume
that
for
the
moment,
is
it
your
position
that
any
such
liability
should
be
preempted--
justice
kennedy
--by
reason
of
a
decision
that's
in
your
favor
here?
justice
kennedy
but
is
it
your
position--
justice
kennedy
--so
your...
your
position
is
that
a
failure
to
find
a
bfoq
and
a
requirement
that
the
employer
be
placed...
that
the
employee
have
the
position
should
preempt
any
tort
liability
for
any
injury
to
the
fetus?
justice
kennedy
not
negligent,
yes.
justice
kennedy
so
that
in
your
position,
the
fetus
should
not
be
able
to
recover,
or
the
newly
born
child,
absent
negligence?
justice
kennedy
so
there's...
so
there's
no
possible
grounds
for
recovery
for
the
injured
child
under
your
view?
justice
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
you
could
refuse
to
sell
cigarettes
to
pregnant
women
employees?
justice
kennedy
no,
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
no,
it's
in
your
company
cafeteria
and
it's
been
done
for
20
years,
let's
assume.
justice
kennedy
you
assume
they
could--
justice
kennedy
--i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
theory
of
your
case.
