justice
o'connor
mr.
jaspan,
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
coming
to
grips
with
the
effect
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act...
the
pda...
which
says
that
female
employees
affected
by
pregnancy
shall
be
treated
the
same
for
all
employment-related
purposes
as
other
persons
not
affected
but
similar
in
their
ability
or
inability
to
work.
and
i
think
you
have
to
address
that
act
and
its
effect
on
your
position,
and
i
think
also
the
effect
of
this
court's
holding
in
the
dothard
opinion,
which
certainly
points
in
the
direction
of
saying
that
safety
concerns
are
not
going
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
defense
under
bfoq,
in
essence.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
but
i
thought
the
policy
reviewed
here
applies
to
women
who
are
not
pregnant
and--
justice
o'connor
--who
can...
who
can
perform
the
work.
