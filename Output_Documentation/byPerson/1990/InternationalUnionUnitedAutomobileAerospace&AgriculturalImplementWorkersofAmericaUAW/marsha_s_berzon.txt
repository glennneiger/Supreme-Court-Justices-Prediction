ms.
marsha
s.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
the
validity
under
title
vii
of
a
policy
that
bans
from
lead-exposed
jobs
because
of
fetal
health
concerns
any
woman
who
cannot
provide
medical
evidence
that
she
is
physically
incapable
of
bearing
a
child.
the
policy
applies
regardless
of
the
woman's
age,
marital
status,
the
fertility
of
her
spouse,
her
intent
to
have
a
child,
her
use
of
contraception,
and
how
careful
she
is
in
using
the
hygiene
practices
that
the
company
has
prescribed
and
which,
according
to
the
company,
should
keep
blood
lead
levels
if
properly
used
below
the
level
safe
for
fetuses.
and
the
company
applies
this
policy
as
well
despite
evidence
that
lead
at
the
same
levels,
blood
lead
levels,
produces
in
men
reproductive
injury,
including
infertility,
and
produces
in
people
generally
cardiovascular
disease
and
neurological
harm.
our
position
is
that
this
policy
violates
title
vii
because
it
explicitly
and
broadly
excludes
women
and,
as
such,
violates...
basic
title
vii
principles
and
because
for
three
independent
reasons
the
policy
does
not
come
within
the
only
available
defense
under
title
vii,
the
defense
that
this
court
has
called
the
narrowest
of
exceptions
in
dothard
v.
rawlinson,
section
703(e),
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense,
known
as
the
bfoq
defense.
first,
the
policy
that
johnson
controls
is
seeking
to
justify
today
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
basic
precepts
and
principles
of
title
vii,
especially
as
title
vii
was
amended
in
1978
by
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
this
court
stated
emphatically
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
the
city
of
los
angeles
v.
manhart,
price
waterhouse
v.
hopkins
last
term,
arizona
governing
committee
v.
norris,
that
an
employer
cannot
disadvantaged
a
woman
simply
because
of
her
membership
in
the
group
of
women...
because
she
is
a
woman.
and
here,
the
overwhelming
number
of
the
women
who
are
being
excluded
because
of
the
policy
at
issue
present
no
risk
to
the
health
of
any
child
either
because
they
have
no
intention
to
have
a
child
or
any
more
children,
or
because
they
will
delay
having
children
until
they
are
safely
removed
or
out
of
lead-exposed
job,
or
because
they
will
keep
their
lead
levels
down,
blood
lead
levels
down
through
efficient
hygiene.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
our...
our--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that
is
true
with
respect
to
the
broadest
of
the
three
propositions
that
we
have
before
the
court.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that
is
true
with
respect
to
the
broadest
of
the
three
positions
that
we
have
before
the
court
today.
however--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
correct.
however,
i...
i
would
like
to
admonish
the
court
of
three
things
in
that
regard.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
other
reasons
which
i
will
discuss
later
which
would
not
necessarily
implicate
a
pregnancy-limited
policy
and
which
are
more
than
sufficient
to
require
reversal
of
the
policy
before
the
court
today.
in
addition,
though,
and
quite
importantly,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
most
extreme
hypothetical
should
determine
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this...
for
the
following
reasons:
first
of
all,
a
pregnancy-limited
policy
would
be...
could
be
devised
in
a
way
that
is
nondiscriminatory
in
the
first
place
because
if
the
employer
treated
pregnancy-related
harms
similarly
to
other
temporary
instances
of
hypersusceptibility,
one
might
have
a
nondiscriminatory
policy.
that
is
more
or
less
what
osha
has
done
in
its
lead
standard.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
yes,
because
one
could
remove
the
people
temporarily.
that's
not
an
option
in
this
case.
and
if
a
temporary
removal
of
that
kind
was
applied
across
the
board
to
similar
temporary
hypersusceptible
situations,
we
might
have
a
nondiscriminatory
policy.
but,
in
addition,
the
science
of
the
situation--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--yes,
but
what
i'm
saying--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--is
that
if
it
isn't
special
treatment...
that
is,
if
men
who
have
reproductive...
possible
reproductive
harm
as
well
as
women
who
are
pregnant
are
treated
similarly
as
the
osha--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's...
that's
true.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
was...
would
presents
another
question
that's
not
here.
but
in
addition,
the
science
of
the
situation
is
such
that
it
is
at
least
unlikely
that
one
would
have
an
injury
which
in
fact
affects
pregnant
women
only
and
not
others.
so
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
pregnancy
hypothetical
is
not
one
which
we
feel
ought
to
be
driving
this
case
because
this
involves
a
much
more
egregious
and
central
infringement
of
title
vii
values
and
principles.
the...
indeed,
the
policy
that
we
have...
actually
have
before
the
court
is
based
not
on...
so
much
on
a
biological
risk
difference
as
on
a
negative
behavioral...
behavioral
stereotype
about
how
women
who
are
faced
with
possible
fetal
harm
will
behave.
that
is,
in
today's
day
and
age,
women
in
general
can
control
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
have
children,
and,
therefore,
in
supposing
that
they
will
not
the
policy
is
incorporating
a
negative
behavioral...
behavioral
stereotype.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
we--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--we
know
that
it
is
for
some
time
period
after
a
person
is
removed
from
lead
exposure,
and
there
are
various
estimates
in
the
record.
what
is
not
in
the
record
is
any
precise
indication
of
how
long
one
has
to
be
in
a
lead-exposed
job
before
those
blood
lead
levels
build
up.
the
reason
that's--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--some
of
the
estimates
were
two
to
three
times
as
long
as
it
took
to
build
up.
one
person
said
100
days.
another
person
said
that
he
wasn't
sure
whether
a
removal
of
2
months
would
be
sufficient.
somebody
said
as
much
as
a
year.
in
any
event,
at
some
point
a
woman
who
is
being
adequately
warned
could
remove
herself,
let
her
blood
lead
levels
go
down,
and
then
have
a
child.
in
addition,
the
policy
embodies
a
stigmatic
harm
of
the
kind
that
justice
o'connor
said
was
at
the
core
of
title
vii
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
price
waterhouse
v.
hopkins,
because
it
subjects
women,
as
the
complaint
said,
to
embarassment
and
humiliation
because
of
their
private
reproductive
functions
being
made
public.
that
is,
everyone
in
the
plant
knows
which
women
are
fertile
and
which
women
are
not
fertile
by
which
jobs
they
are
placed
in.
finally,
a
central
purpose
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
and
of
title
vii
was
to
prevent
practices
that,
as
senator
williams
explained--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--the
very
last
one
i'm
not
sure
would,
because
people
can
see
who's
pregnant.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
yes,
but
there
are
other
ways
to
know
which
woman
are...
is
pregnant.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that's
true,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
substantially
less
severe.
in
any
event,
the
purpose
of
title
vii
and
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
was
to
prevent
practices
that,
in
the
words
of
senator
williams,
a
chief
proponent
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
"because
she
might
become
pregnant,
relegate
women
in
general
to
a
second-class
status
with
regard
to
career
advancement
and
continuity
of
employment
and
wages,
render
women
marginal
workers
and
oust
them
from
the
workplace.
"
the
fetal-risk
policies
of
this
kind...
that
is,
those
that
apply
to
all
fertile
women...
if
upheld,
would
keep
women
from
a
broad
range
of
jobs
because
there
are,
in
fact,
a
broad
range
of
jobs
that
present
potential
fetal
risks
due
to
toxics,
but
also
due
to
disease,
stress,
noise,
radiation,
and
also
to
ordinary
physical
accidents,
like
car
accidents,
falls,
et
cetera.
one
example
of
this
is
that
there
was
a
recent
study
which
showed
that
doctors
have
four
times
the
prematurity
rate...
women
doctors...
of
other
women,
and
as
we
understand
the
arguments
that
johnson
controls
is
making
today,
that
might
well
be
sufficient...
studies
of
those
kind...
to
ban
women
from
being
doctors.
the
net
effect
of
upholding
a
policy
of
this
type,
therefore,
would
be
to
sanction
the
resegregation
of
the
work
force,
particularly
because
the
economics
of
the
situation
are
that
employers
are
going
to
instill
fetal
protection
policies
in
instances
in
which
they
are
not
dependent
on
women
workers
for
their
work
force
and
not
instigate
them
where
they
are
highly
dependent
on
women
workers,
because
then
they
would
have
nobody
to
do
the
job.
so
the
effect
is
that
women
will
end
up
in
the
jobs
where
they
began
before
title
vii
was
passed...
that
is,
in
child
care
centers,
hospital
nurses,
teachers...
not
because
there
are
fewer
fetal
risks
in
those
jobs
but
because
those
are
the
jobs
in
which
they
are
indispensable.
the
net
effect
is
that
this
policy,
if
upheld,
would
cut
the
heart
out
of
title
vii
and
out
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
the
question,
then,
is
whether
congress
intended
to
nonetheless
allow
employers
to
pursue
policies
of
this
kind
within
the
language
of
the
bona
fide
occupation
qualification
exception
which
reads
very
narrowly.
it
says
that
it
applies
in
those
certain
instances
in
which
sex
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
a
particular
business.
johnson
controls
argues
that
despite
this
extraordinarily
narrow
language
and
the
vast
damage
done
to
title
vii,
this
has
to
be
a
bfoq,
because
otherwise
one
couldn't
protect
fetal
health.
i
will
proceed
in
a
moment
to
outline
the
three
reasons
why
we
think
that
that
is
simply
wrong,
but
first
i'd
like
to
respond
briefly
to
the
emotional
content
of
johnson
controls'
argument.
that
is,
by
placing
this
case
in
its
real
context
as
part
of
the
social
problem
of
protecting
fetal
health.
first
of
all,
the
issue
of
fetal
health
is
far
more
complicated
than
the
employer
admits.
to
understand
why,
let's
consider
two
possible
scenarios.
first
of
all,
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
history
demonstrates
that
women
work
because
they
have
to,
and
it
demonstrates
as
well
and
emphatically,
and
this
was
discussed
at
some
length
on
the
floor
and
also
in
the
hearings,
that
there
is
a
major
danger
to
fetal
health
due
to
maternal
poverty
and
also
due
to
an
inability
of
women
to
have
prenatal
care
if
they're
unemployed,
and
that
those
dangers
are
similar
to
the
sorts
of
dangers
johnson
controls
is
claiming
here.
they
are
dangers
of
retardation,
neurological
damage,
and
so
on.
if
many
employers
adopt
fetal
protection
policies,
as
i've
suggested
they
might
if
johnson
controls'
principles
were
upheld
here
today,
the
net
result
will
be
that
many
women
will
not
have
adequate
income
and
will
be
relegating
their
children
to
precisely
those
fetal
harms
which
congress
was
in
fact
trying
to
prevent
in
passing
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
the
other
possibility
is
that
many...
some
employers
protect
these...
won't
institute
fetal
protection
policies
for
reasons
of
the
sort
i
alluded
to
earlier.
that
is,
because
they
are
the
employers
who
are
dependent
on
female
workers.
if
that
happens,
women
may
have
jobs
in
those
workplaces,
but
they
are
traditionally
lower
paid,
and
also
they
do
not
necessarily
have
lesser
fetal
risks.
they
simply
have
different
fetal
risks.
a
related
point
about
the
social
context
of
this
case,
or
the
larger
context
of
this
case,
is
that
the
issue
here
really,
therefore,
is
not
whether
fetal
health
is
going
to
be
protected,
but
how
and
by
whom.
obviously,
an
employer
is
welcome
and
ought
to
be
protecting
fetal
health
to
the
highest
degree
possible,
as
long
as
he
doesn't
exclude
women
from
the
workplace,
but
in
addition,
there
are
two
other
decision
makers
here.
there's
the
woman,
and
there's
the
government.
the
government
in
this
instance,
in
osha...
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration...
deciding
the
lead
standard
in
1978
emphatically
decided,
under
its
own
statute...
section
38
of
its
own
statute...
that
it
is
not
reasonably
necessary
for
employers
to
exclude
all
fertile
women
from
the
workplace
because
of
occupational
safety
and
health
concerns.
interestingly,
note
that
the
language
of
osha
is
the
same...
section
38
of
osha...
as
the
bfoq:
reasonably
necessary.
so
what
osha
decided
is
really
exactly
the
same
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today.
osha
decided
that
it
is
not
reasonably
necessary
to
have
an
exclusion
of
this
kind.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it
does
prescribe
in
certain
instances
that
certain
people
should
be
removed,
at
least
temporarily,
because
of
a
medical
problem.
the...
osha
said
in
the
preamble
to
its
lead
standard
that
no
issue
was
discussed
more
completely
in
the
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
than
the
question
of
women
and
lead.
there
were
specific
proposals
before
osha
to
either
apply
or
allow
the
exclusion
of
fertile
women,
and
thereby
to
have
the
higher
overall
lead
standard,
and
osha
rejected
that
proposition
emphatically
and
decided
that
it
was
not
reasonably
necessary
to
occupational
safety
and
health
for
women
to...
fertile
women
to
be
excluded
from
the
workplace.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
think
it
well
might,
but
i
think
that
title
vii
itself
prevents
it,
for
the
following
reason.
what...
the
proposition
that
the
employer,
as
i
understand
it,
is
putting
before
the
court
on
the
liability
or
legal
duty
question,
is
that
it
could
be
held
liable
strictly
for
employing
the
woman
in
a
lead-exposed
job.
i
mean,
i
assume
we
would
all
agree
that
if
they
were...
actually
negligent
in
how
lead
was
controlled
in
the
workplace,
or
gave
inadequate
warnings,
that
title
vii
should
not
protect
them,
and
therefore
the
only
possibility
is
that
they
are
being...
could
be
held
liable
simply
from
hiring
the
woman.
that
is...
so
they
are
positing
a
state
rule
that
they
may
not
hire
women
in
this
job.
there
were
lots
of
rules
like
that
before
title
vii
was
passed.
they
were
statutes
that
were
called
protective
laws,
and
they
were
held
invalid
under
title
vii.
in
other
words,
there
were
laws
that
said,
you
may
not
hire
women
in
jobs
that
have
too
much
lifting,
or
you
may
not
hire
women
in
other
sorts
of
jobs.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
would
suppose
that--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
extremely
good
evidence
as
to
what
a
reasonable
person
would
do.
on
the
other
hand,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we're
all
speculating
here
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
case
like
this;
and
the
fact
that
there's
never
been
a
case
like
this
is
itself
somewhat
indicative
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
the
business
for
an
employer
to
turn
somersaults
in
order
to
avoid
a
theory
of
liability
that
does
not
yet
exist.
more
than
that,
i...
i
really
do
think
that
if
the
employer
is
actually
negligent
in
the
way
in
which
he
is
running
the
workplace
according
to
a
reasonable
person's
standard,
there
is
absolutely
no
way
that
title
vii's
bfoq
ought
to
absolve
him.
it's
both
bad
law
in
terms
of
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
it's
also
very
poor
occupational
health
policy,
because
it
means
that
an
employer
is
allowing...
being
allowed
to
discriminate
in
order
to
avoid
being...
responsible
as
to
its
occupational
health
responsibilities.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it's
as
if
the
employer
said
i
would
rather
have
hired
blacks
because
if
i
hire
them
i'm
going
to
have
to
have...
act
toward
them
in
a
nonnegligent
fashion.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
that
deals
with
that
question.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
not
really,
and
the
reason
is
because
liability
as
such...
that
is,
the
cost
that
they
might
have
to
pay...
they
understand
and
we
understand
as
a
monetary
factor
cannot
be
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
the
argument
that's
being
made
now,
as
i
understand
it,
is
somewhat
different.
it's
not
the
economics
as
such.
it
is,
rather,
some
notion
that
there
is
a
perceived
legal
duty
flowing
from
a
hypothetical
common
law
rule
which,
as
i
say,
doesn't
exist
because
no
case
exists.
no
one
has
yet--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--it's
my
position--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that
is
precisely
what
a
series
of
cases
that
this
court
has
affirmatively
cited
held--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--and
it
is
my
position,
and
it's
also
the
employer's
position,
by
the
way.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it's
my
position,
and
it
is
also
the
employer's
position.
not
any
tort
liability.
any
tort
liability
for
behavior
which
is
not
negligent
or
the
warning--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--yes.
which
is
not
negligent
and
where
there
were
adequate
warnings.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that's
correct.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that
assumes
that
the
mother
would
be
negligent
if
she
put
the
fetus
in
that
position,
and,
for
the
reasons
that
i
stated
earlier,
that
is
an
extremely
unlikely
context.
and
it's
also
true
that
the,
again,
the
theory
in
which
the
mother
could
become
liable
does
not
yet
exist,
and
i
would
argue
strongly
against
it
largely
because...
and
as
i
was
about
to
say...
the
woman
herself
is
a
decision
maker
in
this
situation,
and
the
woman
is--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
think
that
would
be
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
as
i
was
about
to
say,
we
are
assuming
a
level
of
fetal
injuries
here
that
excludes
the
fact
that
women
are
going
to
act
responsibly,
and
that
society
in
general,
as
this
court
said
emphatically
in
parham
v.
j.r.,
places
in
the
hands
of
parents
the
responsibility
to
save
their
children
from
risk,
recognizing
that
sometimes...
occasionally
they
will
make
mistakes,
but
that
if
they
do
make
mistakes
or
if
a
problem
develops
along
that
way,
one
does
not
put
in
the
hands
of
a
private
individual
the
decision
whether
they
ought
to
be
overridden.
it's
the
government
that
ordinarily
has
the
power
to
override
parental
decisions,
not
the
government.
nothing
in
this
case
implicates
that
relationship
and
would
prevent
osha
or
some
other
agency
or
the
congress
from
making
determinations
of
that
kind.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
employer
can
do
it;
and
what's
noteworthy
is
that
the
employer's
position
here
is
really,
as
judge
easterbrook
said
below,
a
not-on-our-watch
position.
in
other
words,
we
don't
want
to
be
tied
into
this
harm.
what
happens
to
this
fetus
and
the
rest
of
the
world
is
just
not
our
problem.
and
that's
why
the
woman
is
a
much
more,
both
traditional
but
also
completely
informed
decision
maker.
she
also
knows
her
own
personal
situation
as
to
whether
she
is
likely
to
have
a
child
or
not.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
we
do
not
move
for
summary
judgment;
and,
therefore,
the
net
result
of
a
reversal
would
be
a
remand
to
the
trial
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
several
comments.
first
of
all,
we
certainly
do
not
concede
that
the
brisk
comparison
here
was
done
properly.
the...
our
contention
is
that
in
order
to
adequately
assess
the
risk
involved,
one
has
to
look
at
the
class
of
people
who
are
being
excluded
and
not
simply
the
question
of
whether,
if
there
are
actual
fetuses,
which
is
what
we
were
talking
about
when
we
said
there
was
a
substantial
risk,
is...
is
injured.
in
other
words,
while
we
did
agree
that
the
kind
of
injury
to
fetuses
as
to
actually
pregnant
women
if
the
risk
occurred
was
substantial,
and
we
certainly
did
not
concede
that
looking
at
fertile
women
as
a
whole,
the
likelihood
that
any
injury
would
actually
occur
would
be
any
greater
than
the
level
of
adult
risk
accepted
in
the
workplace.
and
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
questions
about
how
one
should
tell
how
much
risk
is
enough,
we
suggest
that
the
best
test
is
what
does
the
employer
normally
accept
in
the
workplace
as
to
health
risks
generally.
that
comparative
standard
is
not
factored
into
the
test
that
was
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
to
the
test...
or
to
the
test
that
the
company
here
suggests.
in
other
words,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
adult
risks
are
being
perfectly
protected,
but
the
company
is
insisting
on
perfectly
protecting
fetal
risks.
for
example--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--on...
on
that
aspect
of...
that
defect
in
their
bfoq
policy,
yes.
in
other
words,
if
one
were
to
cite
only
that
there
was
that
defect
and
not
go
on
to
our
broader
proposition
based
upon
the
occupational
qualification
requirement...
that
is,
the
notion
that
because
of
the
language
of
the
bfoq,
the
focus
on
occupational
qualifications,
because
of
the
language
of
the
pda,
the
reference
to
the
ability
or
inability
to
work,
the
fact
that
dothard,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
indicates
that
the
woman's
own
health
is
not
a
safety...
is
not
a
bfoq
and
the
fact
that
the
pda,
it
seems
to
us,
indicates
that
this
case
is
to
be
treated
like
a
dothard
case
and
not,
for
example,
like
a
criswell
case
in
which
the
safety
concern
was
the
essence
of
the
business,
as
the
court
greatly
stressed
both
in
that
case
and
in
dothard.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
we
do
not
move
for
summary
judgment,
and
we
are
not
asking--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--yes,
to
get
it
back
to
the
district
court.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
at
that
point,
it
appears
that
we...
we
would
look
at
the
record,
and
we
would
decide
whether
to...
for
us
to
move
for
summary
judgment
at
that
point.
but--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
right,
but
we
also
think
we
would
have
good
ground
for
summary
judgment
in
our
other
two
arguments
as
well--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--because--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
think
that
is
probably
correct.
but
i'm
suggesting
as
well
that--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--yes,
but
the...
the
actual
disposition
would
simply
be
a
remand.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
to
the
trial
court
for
further
proceedings.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
was
going
to
say
that
the...
so
on
the
one
hand,
this...
the
standard
which
johnson
controls
is
arguing
does
not
factor
in
any
comparative
risk
notion
or
any
reason
why
an
employer
cannot
insist
upon
perfect
protection
for
fetal
health
while
not
protecting
adult
health
perfectly,
not
to
say
adequately,
but
not
perfectly.
there
is...
and
contrary
to
what
the
company
has
been
suggesting,
here
there
is
clear
evidence
in
the
record
of
cardiovascular
dangers,
neurological
dangers
and
male
fertility
dangers...
which,
by
the
way,
are
conceded...
with
respect
to
adult
health,
and
those
are
not
being
perfectly
protected
against.
in
addition,
this
policy
fails
for
another
reason,
which
is
that
it
does
not...
it
excludes
a
class
all
or
substantially
all
of
whom
are
not
within
the
group
that
actually
presents
the
risk.
criswell
doesn't
apply
here
or,
if
applied
here,
leads
to
an
opposite
conclusion,
not
for
the
reason
that
mr.
jaspan
suggested
but
because
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
individualize
the
risk
assessment.
it's
just
impossible
for
the
employer
to
individualize
the
risk
assessment
because
the
employer
doesn't
want
to
ask
the
private
questions.
the
woman,
herself,
knows
what
her
situation
is,
and,
therefore,
we're
not
dealing,
as
i
said
before,
with
a
biological
fact.
we're
dealing
with
a
behavioral
fact
which
cannot
be
presumed
against
the
woman.
in
addition
and
connected
to
that
is
that
the
extreme
case
hypothetical
which
mr.
jaspan
suggested
assumes
that
if
one
went
to
an
actually
pregnant
woman
in
a
nuclear
power
plant
and
said
the
following
five
things
are
going
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stay
in
this
workplace
and
also,
for
example,
provided
her
with
another
comparable
job
that
she
would
stay
there,
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
that;
and
in
any
event,
if
there
is
one
woman
like
that
in
the
world,
we
are
talking
about
an
extremely
minuscule
risk.
in
addition
and
again
related,
mr.
jaspan
suggests
that
this
company
tried
that.
well,
the
fact
is
the
company
didn't
try
it.
justice
posner
said
in
his
dissent
below
that
the
warning
that
the
company
gave
to
women
was
more
likely
to
allay
than
to
arouse
concern.
i
think
if
the
court
reads
that
warning--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--it
would
agree
with
that
proposition.
