justice
souter
what
actual
advice
do
they
give
them?
justice
souter
well,
does
it
say
that
you
get
nothing
if
the
personal
injury
is
unaccompanied
by
a
physical
manifestation?
justice
souter
it
just
says...
what
does
it
say?
there's
a
$75,000
limit?
justice
souter
of
course,
that's
still
literally
consistent
with
the
position
that
eastern
is
taking.
justice
souter
yeah,
but
to
say
there's
a
$75,000
limit
on
all
personal
injury
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
there
is
a
zero
limit
on
personal
injury
unaccompanied
by
a
physical
manifestation.
justice
souter
well,
is
that
accepted...
i
mean,
that
may
be
a,
it
may
be
a
pathological
kind
of
functioning,
but
it's
not
an
injury
to
the
brain
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
a
tissue
injury
if
a
bullet
went
through
it
or
a
blunt
object
penetrated
it.
i
mean--
justice
souter
--that's,
that's
kind
of
the
brain's
equivalent
of
my
manifestation
of
high
blood
when
i
get
scared.
that's
something
other
than
a
physical
injury,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
that's
right.
it's
a
response.
justice
souter
it's
a
response
to
something
that
i
perceive.
and
what
you're
describing
as
a
brain
injury
is
just
a
response
to
something
perceived,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
well,
it's
a
mental
injury,
but
it's
not
a
brain
injury,
is
it?
justice
souter
and
you
think
that's
bodily
injury?
justice
souter
as
we
normally
use
that
term?
