justice
scalia
you,
you
rely
on
the
language
i
presume,
which
does,
does
not
say
damages
caused
by
death,
wounding,
or
other
bodily
injury,
but
damage
sustained
in
the
event
of.
there
is
no
causal
connection
required
in
that
text,
nor
in
the
french
which
says
"en
cas
de
mort",
in
the
event
of
death.
not,
not
as
we...
i'm
helping...
i'm
trying
to
help
you
here.
justice
scalia
the
problem
i
have,
mr.
murray,
is
that
i
cannot
imagine
a
bodily
injury
that
is
not
a
wounding...
i
mean,
wounding
is
a
very...
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
good...
"a
lesion
corporelle"
that
is
not
a
"blessure".
can
you
tell
me
an
example
of--
justice
scalia
--very,
very
elegant,
but
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
it's
right.
[laughter]
did...
neither
brief,
although
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
makes
any
point
out
of
the
phrase
"de
tout
autre",
of
any
other...
does
that
just
not
help
either
party?
justice
scalia
well,
it
may
harm
your
case
a
little
bit,
because
if
you...
as
you've
just
described
the
difference
between
"blessure"
and
"lesion
corporelle",
"lesion
corporelle"
is
not
another...
i
mean
a
"blessure"
is
one
kind
of
"lesion
corporelle",
i
assume.
justice
scalia
you've
told
me...
you've
told
me
that
they're
two
different
things.
justice
scalia
but
lesion
does
not
mean
lesion.
it
means
harm.
it
means
prejudice.
it
means
a
lot
of
things
like
that
in
french,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean
we
shouldn't
be
misled
to
think
that
it
means
lesion.
justice
scalia
your
position
is
that
when
it's
combined
with
"corporelle",
it
means
what
you
say.
justice
scalia
but
when
we
grant
cert.,
i
assume
we
grant
cert.
on
the
question
that's
contained
on
the
first
page.
i...
you
know,
i
don't
know
what
to
look
to
as
to...
you
know
anything...
i'm
not
going
read
every
part
of
every
brief
to
find
out
what
we
granted
cert.
on.
i
want
to
be
able
to
turn
to
the
first
page
and
say
this
is
the
issue
they
want
us
to
address,
and
that
wasn't
there
at
all.
justice
scalia
it
wasn't
[inaudible]
a
separate
section
addressing
it,
but
it
was
sort
of
by
the
way,
you
know,
while
you're
about
it,
you
might
want
to
address
this
other
question.
justice
scalia
is
how
you
sort
of
put
it.
justice
scalia
but
there
were
not
any...
i
mean,
this
is
a
treaty
we're
talking.
maybe
that's
why
they
had
to
invent
a
new
term
like
"lesion
corporelle"
which
does
not
exist.
although
there
were
such
causes
of
action
in
french
law,
there
were
none
in
english
law,
as
i
understand
it.
and
i
doubt
whether
there
were
any
in
the
united
states...
i
remember
when
i
was
in
law
school,
it
was
considered
avant-garde
in
those
states
that
allowed
recovery
for
mental
distress
when
there
had
been
no
physical
harm.
so
you're
asking
us
to
believe
that
the
english,
who
not
only
had
never
heard
of
it
then,
don't
even
know
of
it
now,
and
the
united
states
representatives,
who
also
didn't
know
of
it
at
the
time,
signed
on
to
a
treaty
that
provides...
with
respect
to
a
new
technology...
this
kind
of
extraordinary
relief
that
didn't
even
exist
for,
you
know,
hitting
somebody
with
a
hammer
or
scaring
somebody
with
a
hammer
domestically.
justice
scalia
that's
must
not
plausible,
is
it?
justice
scalia
unintentional?
justice
scalia
negligent
assault?
what's
a
negligent
assault?
i--
justice
scalia
--it's
an
intentional
tort.
the
only
torts
i'm
aware
of
where
you
could
recover
for
emotional
injury
alone
were
intentional.
we're
talking
here
of
negligence
or
indeed
even
absolute
liability,
not
even
negligence,
less
than
negligence.
justice
scalia
engines
don't
fail?
that's...
that's
not
to
be
expected
either
like--
justice
scalia
well,
you,
gee,
you
don't
ordinarily
encountered
the
kind
of
turbulence
that
causes
somebody
to
get
hurt.
that's
very
rare.
just
as
all
of
the
engines
on
a
plane
going
out
is
very
rare,
but
it
happens.
justice
scalia
right.
i
think
one's
an
accident,
just
as
the
other
one
is.
justice
scalia
i'm
talking
about
bone-breaking
turbulence.
i'm
not
just,
you
know,
a
few...
a
little
bump.
justice
scalia
seems
like
an
accident
to
me.
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
what
about
unexpected
turbulence?
justice
scalia
mr.
eaton,
before
you
leave
the...
you
know,
this
textual
stuff
to
an
extent,
dr.
mankiewicz,
did
he
say
anything
more
categoric,
because
i
didn't
go
back
and
consult
his
treatise?
what
is
quoted
in
the
opinion
below
is
his
statement
that
while
bodily
injury
is
undoubtedly
a
grammatically
correct
translation
of
"lesion
corporelle",
it
may
rightly
be
argued
that...
it
may...
it
may
rightly
be
argued
that
the
meaning
of
that
expression
in
french
law
and
its
equivalence
in
other
civil
laws
are
more
correctly
rendered
by
the
expression
personal
injury.
that's
sort
of,
you
know--
justice
scalia
--is
he
just
saying,
you
know,
it's
a
nice
question
or
does
he
really
come
down
four-square
for
the
fact
that
that's
what
it
means?
justice
scalia
he
didn't.
justice
scalia
the
usual
scholarly
opinion,
waffling
and--
justice
scalia
--yeah.
justice
scalia
is
more
appropriately...
he
says
that?
justice
scalia
not
just
maybe
argued
that
it--
justice
scalia
--he
said
what
i
said.
okay.
justice
scalia
but
wouldn't
it
have
been
misleading
to
put
on
the
tickets
that
there's
a
$75,000
limit
for,
for
bodily
injury,
leaving...
leaving
the
implication
that
if
you
had
mental
distress
besides
the
bodily
injury,
you
could
recover
something
more.
i
mean
if,
you
know,
if
i
were
writing
it
as
a
limitation
provision,
i
might
well
want
to
say
for
personal
injury
to
avoid
implying
to
the
passenger
that
the
$75,000
limit
applied
only
to
bodily
injury
but
you
could
get
more
money
for
mental
distress,
whereas
in
fact
what
they're
saying
is
you
can't
get
anything
for
mental
distress
unless
it
accompanies
bodily
injury.
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
good
reason
for
translating
it
that
way?
justice
scalia
he
didn't
fall
into
it.
he
jumped
in
and
invited
the
eleventh
circuit
to
follow
him,
i
think.
[laughter]
