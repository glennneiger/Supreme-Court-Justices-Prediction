mr.
john
michael
murray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
an
accident
as
defined
by
the
warsaw
convention
that
occurred
aboard
eastern
airlines
flight
number
855
while
in
route
from
miami
to
nassau
in
the
bahamas.
as
flight
855
approached
nassau,
the
flight
crew
noticed
a
low
oil
pressure
indication
on
one
of
the
lockheed
1011's
three
engines.
they
shut
down
that
engine
and
began
a
return
to
miami.
in
route
the
other
two
engines
of
the
aircraft
quit
because
of
oil
starvation.
after
a
period
of
unpowered
flight,
the
crew
restarted
the
engine
originally
shut
down
and
was
able
to
effect
a
safe
landing
at
the
miami
international
airport.
none
of
the
passengers
in
these
cases
suffered
any
physical
injury.
because
the
crew
issued
appropriate
warnings
to
the
passengers
including
ditching
instructions,
safety
instructions,
and
ultimately
a
notice
that
ditching
is
imminent,
it's
undisputed
that
some
of
these
passengers
suffered
fright.
eastern
received
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
john
michael
murray
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
john
michael
murray
well,
there
were
162
people
on
board
and
there
are
25
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
so
i
guess
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
from...
from
that.
eastern,
after
having
received
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
was...
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
that
and
held
that
emotional
injury
was
in
fact
compensable
under
warsaw,
and
that's
the
primary
issue
about
which
we're
here
today.
because
of
the
tenor
of
the
respondents'
brief,
i
think
it's
important
that
i
note
one
thing
specifically
here,
and
that
is
that
the
fault
or
culpability
of
eastern
airlines
in
this
matter
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
it's
not
is
because
eastern's
liability
is
governed
by
the
provisions
of
the
warsaw
convention.
specifically
article
17
of
the
convention
provides
that
the
carrier
shall
be
liable.
it's
an
absolute
liability
provision
when
merged
with
the
montreal
agreement.
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
for
damages
sustained
in
the
event
of
death,
wounding,
or
bodily
injury.
mr.
john
michael
murray
our
position
is,
justice
o'connor,
that
they
can.
we
think
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
manifest,
palpable,
physical
injury,
and
the
damages
suffered
in
any
form
after
that
are
recoverable.
mr.
john
michael
murray
no,
it's
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
feel
that
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"...
i
hesitate
to
use
it
as
a
term
of
law
in
france,
but
it
is
a
french
term
that
it
uniquely
indicative
of
trauma
or
lesion
to
or
infringement
of
the
body
or
an
organ
of
the
body.
mr.
john
michael
murray
i
think--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--well,
your
honor,
the
convention
provides...
the
original
french
version
of
the
convention
provides
that
a
past...
that
the
carrier
is
responsible
for
damage
or
dommage
in
the
original
french.
it's
given
very
broad
connotations.
the
briefs
discuss
at
length
the
definition
of
"dommage",
"dommage
materiel",
"dommage
moral",
"dommage
corporel".
but
the
fact
is
that
in
the
french
version
of
article
17,
the
unqualified
word
damage,
"dommage",
is
used.
mr.
john
michael
murray
we
believe
it
includes
the
emotional
injury--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--exactly,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
that
that
"lesion
corporelle",
the
occurrence
of
a
physical
injury,
is
a
condition
preceded
to
recovering
whatever
damages
a
passenger
suffers.
mr.
john
michael
murray
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
result,
your
honor.
i
think
the
reason...
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
it's
important
to
have
the
physical
manifestation
of
some
sort
is,
as
the
briefs
have
pointed
out,
is
to
sort
the
meritorious
from
the
unmeritorious
claims.
i
think
that
was
an
intent
of
the
convention.
mr.
john
michael
murray
yes,
i--
[laughter]
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
a
literal,
correct
interpretation
of
the
french
and
the
english
translation
of
article
17,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the...
frankly
was
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
convention
to,
to
do
exactly
what
they
did
there.
as,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
it...
the
damage
which
is
unqualified,
the
word
damage,
dommage,
is
unqualified,
and
it
arises
only
in
the
event
of
the
occurrence
of
death...
"mort",
wounding...
"blessure",
or
bodily
injury,
"lesion
corporelle".
mr.
john
michael
murray
yes,
your
honor,
the,
the
research
that
we've
done
into
the
french
meaning
of
these
terms
indicates
that
a
"blessure"
indicates
a
trauma
of
such
force
that
it
is
in
fact
a
wounding
and
the
example
that
the
text
used
is
if
there's
a
simply
compound
fracture
of
a
bone
and
there
is
no
breaking
of
the
skin,
then
that
is
not
a
"blessure".
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
deemed
a
"lesion
corporelle",
a
infringement
of
the
body
or
its
organs.
so
there
are
differences
in
the
french
meaning
between
the
two
terms,
and
that's
the
reason
that
they
were
i
believe
used,
the
three
in
the
alternative.
mr.
john
michael
murray
justice
kennedy--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--justice
kennedy,
it
appears
that...
and
our
analysis
is
that
"mort"
and
"blessure"
are
not
totally
inclusive,
as
i
just
explained,
of
any
bodily
injury,
any
trauma,
any
impact,
any
infringement
on
the
body,
and
the
terms
"de
tout
autre",
"lesion
corporelle"
were
included
to
expand.
mr.
john
michael
murray
i
believe
that,
that
other
words
could
be
used
to
include--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--yes,
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
john
michael
murray
no,
not...
not
to
my
understanding.
mr.
john
michael
murray
that's
correct.
all
right--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--i'm
not
saying
that
they're
two
different
things.
i'm
saying
that
a
"blessure"
would
be
included
within
the
broad
term
of
"lesion
corporelle",
but
not
necessarily
vice
versa.
you
can
have
a
bodily
injury
that
is
not
necessary
a
wounding.
mr.
john
michael
murray
yes,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
the
way
we
read
and
understand
the
phrase.
the
french
and
the
english
translation
of
article
17
we
believe
as
we
have
just
now
discussed
are
quite
clear
and
that
the
damage
recoverable
is
recoverable
in
the
event
of
the
death,
wounding,
or
bodily
injury.
and
we
feel
that
the
wording
of
article
17
is
quite
clear,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
go
any
further
than
that.
but
looking
at
the
drafters'
intent
in
the
1929
convention,
it
is
clear
that
there
was
vast
silence
on
the
issue
of
what
article
17
was
meant
to
include.
the
subsequent
drafting
history,
as
review
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
is
somewhat
more
helpful
in
determining
what
the
drafters
of
the
original
convention
meant.
in
1951
in
madrid,
the...
at
a
subsequent
drafting
convention,
the
french
delegate,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
introduced
an
amendment
which
would
have
changed
and
broadened
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"
to
have
included
mental
injury.
that
was
rejected
in
the
1951
madrid
convention.
similarly,
in
1955
at
the
hague,
the
greek
delegate
asked
for
a
change
to
broaden
the
terms
of
article
17
and
that
was
sounded
defeated.
mr.
john
michael
murray
correct.
mr.
john
michael
murray
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
feel
that
the...
number
one,
the
original
french
translation
of
article
17,
the
original
french
version
rather
of
article
17
remains
unchanged
from
the
1929
convention
to
the
present
time.
there
have
been
changes
that
deal
with
notification
that
incorporate
the
term
"personal
injury".
we
don't
feel
that
they
have
any
significance
at
all
with
respect
to
the
guatemala
city
protocol
and,
as
was
pointed
out
in
saks,
the
guatemala
city
protocol,
not
having
been
ratified
by
the
senate,
does
not
thereby
govern
this
case.
the
line
of
demarcation
that
we're
asking
to...
the
court
to
impose
in
the
interpretation
of
the
convention
is
we
believe
one
that
is
extremely
fair.
the
respondents
have
raised
in
their
brief
the
concern
that
people
would
in
fact
be
injured,
be
frightened,
be
entitled
to
recover
damages
in
these
cases
and
not
be
able
to
effect
that
recovery.
but
the
use
of
the
bodily
injury
requirement
we
feel
is
consistent
with
policies
that
are
in
place
in
this
country
today.
these
type...
this
line
of
demarcation
would
allow
claims
that
are
real,
that
are
significant
to
be...
to
have
a
recovery
effected
and
yet
be
able
to
sort
out
the
unreal,
the
more
trivial
claims,
or
the
more--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--unquestionably,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
will
be.
but
i
think
that
there
needs
to
be
a
determination
made
as
to
where
a
fair
and
equitable
demarcation
line
is,
and
i
believe
that
the
physical,
palpable,
objective-type
manifestation
of
any
injury
meets
that
test.
mr.
john
michael
murray
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
that
is
a
concern
that
eastern
has
and
that
other
carriers
have
in
this...
in
this
issue.
it's
very
clear
that,
number
one,
under
the
warsaw
scheme,
if
there
is
an
accident,
the
carrier
is
absolutely
liable
because
the
montreal
agreement
has
waived
any
ability
of
the
carrier
to
raise
the
due
care
defense.
number
two,
if
a
passenger
having
experienced
an
accident
during
travel
on
the
aircraft
or
during
in
any
of
the
processes
of
embarkation
or
disembarkation,
presents
a
compensable
injury,
he's
automatically
entitled
to
recover.
accident
has
been
held
to
be
a
very
broad,
broadly
defined
term.
it's
very
inclusive.
it
includes
anything
that
is
uninspected
or
unintended
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carrier.
a
turbulence
encounter
that
is
unexpected,
for
example,
is
an
accident.
mr.
john
michael
murray
justice
scalia,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
we
have
dealt
with
that
have...
we've
treated
as
accidents
and
there
certainly
are
cases
that
hold
that
a
turbulence
encounter,
an
unexpected
turbulence
encounter,
is
an
accident,
as
would
be,
for
example,
a
four-engine
aircraft
that
has
a
problem
with
one
engine
and
a
precautionary
shutdown
is
made.
and
if
that
is
announced
to
the
passenger,
that
is
unexpected
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carrier.
that
is
an
accident
under
warsaw
and
it
would
be
compensable.
and
under
that
scenario,
any
passenger
could
then
present
an
absolute
liability
claim
to
the
carrier
saying,
by
the
way,
when
you
shut
the
engine
down
and
you
told
us
about
it,
it
sure
scared
me.
mr.
john
michael
murray
that's--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--that's...
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
montreal
agreement
is
in
fact
the
agreement
that
is
in
place
now.
but
the
strict
liability
provisions
were
intended
under
the
original
1929
convention
and
what
was
added
in
addition
to
the
strict
liability
provisions
was
a
provision
where
the
carrier
could
show
that
it
should
be
exonerated
of
liability
if
it
used
all
due
care
and
that
simply
has
been
waived
with
respect
to
the
montreal
agreement.
and
under
the
scenario
that
the
carriers
operate
now,
any
presentation
of
a
claim
after
a
compensable
accident
gives
rise
to
absolute
liability.
mr.
john
michael
murray
that's
correct.
i...
let
me
retreat
from
that
and
say
that
the
carrier
was
liable
strictly
to
a
passenger,
but
it
was
able
to
avail
itself
of
the
due
care
defense.
i
think
it
was
stronger...
it
was
intended
to
be
stronger
by
the
drafters
of
the
convention
than
recourse
to
the
national
law
at
that
time.
mr.
john
michael
murray
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
and
when
you
say
this
issue,
you
mean
whether
mental
anguish
unaccompanied
by
physical--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--manifestation
is
compensable
under
the
convention?
mr.
john
michael
murray
we
know
of
no
cases
that--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--the...
well,
the
french
law
in
our
judgment
does
contemplate
recovery
in
negligence
cases
for
pure
mental
injury
and
i
think
that
that
is
well
covered
in
the
french
wording
of
article
17
where
it
talks
about
17
and
they...
we
would
feel
that
they
would
contemplate
recovery
for
whatever--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--not
in
this
context
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
john
michael
murray
well,
and
when
you
say
that
term,
are
you--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--"lesion
corporelle".
your
honor,
i
think
the
reason
that...
we
recognized
in
our
brief
that
the
napoleonic
code
at
that
time
did
in
fact
provide
that
when
one
does
wrong
to
another,
he
must
compensate
that
other
for
the
wrong
done.
it's
extremely
broad,
and
it's
not
narrow
at
all.
but
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"
in
our
judgment,
in
our
research
is
not
specifically
a
legal
term.
there
are
terms
that
are
utilized
in
the
french
law,
but
they
modify
the
word
damage,
"dommage".
there
is
"dommage
corporel",
for
example.
there
is
"dommage
materiel".
there
is
"dommage
moral".
mr.
john
michael
murray
i'm
not
saying
we
didn't
find
any
use
of
the
term
"lesion
corporelle",
but
i
think
that
the
readings
that
we
did
and
the
things
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
with
which
there's
very...
generally
no
disagreement
is
the
fact
that
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"
is
translated
appropriately
to
be
bodily
injury.
mr.
john
michael
murray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
michael
murray
that,
that
there--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--exactly.
"lesion",
for
example,
can
be
the
infringement
of
a
right.
it
not...
it
need
not
be
as
you
indicated
a
lesion
or
associated
with
a
bodily
function,
but
used
together
with
the
term
"corporelle",
that's
the
clear
meaning
of
the
term.
and
the
issue
that
we've
also
asked
the
court
to
look
at,
the
second
issue,
is
the
one
dealing
with
exclusivity.
we've
taken
the
position
throughout
the
pendency
of
this
litigation
that
the
warsaw
convention
was
intended
to
be
the
exclusive
vehicle
for
recovery.
mr.
john
michael
murray
yes,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
even
though
it
wasn't
in
the
first
page
of
the
brief
as
a
question
presented,
it
was
certainly
raised.
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court.
it
was
raised
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
it
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
fully
briefed
therein.
mr.
john
michael
murray
under
that
question
perhaps
not,
your
honor,
but
under
rule
14
of
the
rules
of
the
court
we
feel
that
the
question
as
is
discussed
later
in
the
brief
and
is
argued
and
is
fully
presented,
does
adequately
preserve
the
question
of
exclusivity
before
the
court.
mr.
john
michael
murray
it
was
not,
your
honor.
i
must
candidly
admit
that
it
was
not
there.
but
i
must
point
to
the
last
section
of
the
brief--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--yes.
mr.
john
michael
murray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
michael
murray
they
have
held
that
there
is
no
state
law
cause
of
action
for
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
as
pled
in
the
pleadings
of
the
case
that
it
considered,
that's
the--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
cases
under
the
floyd
eleventh
circuit
decision
wherein
the
court
allows
an
amendment
to
the
complaint,
that
is,
the
khoury
case
and
the
dix
case,
and
we
feel
that
the
controversy
is
in
fact
alive.
that
these
two
plaintiffs,
khoury
and
dix,
now
have
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court
to
amend
their
pleadings
and
they
can
fairly
amend
the
state...
to
add
a
state
cause
of
action.
so
we
think
that
within
the
ambit
of
this
case,
that
the
issue
is
alive.
and
they...
we
think
that
article
24
fairly
speaks
for
itself,
that
it
is
intended
to
be...
the
convention
is
intended
to
be
the
sole
vehicle
for
recovery.
the
minutes
absolutely
support
that
contention.
i
would
point
to
the
comments
of
three
delegates
at
the
1929
convention,
specifically
mr.
ambrosini
from
italy,
who
said,
we
wish
that
the
convention
be
applied
in
all
cases.
in
any
case
recourse
to
national
law
must
be
ruled
out.
mr.
ripert
from
france
said>
["],
we
are
absolutely
opposed
to
a
formula
that
would
lead
the
application
of
national
law.
and
sir
alfred
dennis
of
great
britain
said,
in
discussing
article
24,
"it
is
a
very
important
stipulation
which
touches
the
very
substance
of
the
convention
because
this
excludes
recourse
to
common
law.
"
we
feel
that
the
directors
of
the
convention
were
uniform
in
their
intent
that
any
recovery
by
an
injured
passenger
in
international
air
transportation
be
governed
exclusively
by
the
warsaw
convention.
so
in
sum,
we
ask
the
court
to
find,
number
1,
that
a
mental
injury
unaccompanied
by
any
physical
manifestation,
a
physical
injury,
should
be
uncompensable,
and
number
2,
that
the
warsaw
convention
should
be
the
exclusive
vehicle
for
recovery
in
any
claims
in
international
air
transportation.
mr.
john
michael
murray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
point
very
briefly
to
two
things
that
mr.
eaton
said.
mr.
eaton
fell
into
the
trap
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
fell
in
discussing
the
french
meaning
of
the
term
"lesion
corporelle".
mr.
john
michael
murray
that
might
well
be,
your
honor.
but
he
skipped
from
a
determination...
a
discussion
of
"lesion
corporelle"
immediately
to
a
discussion
of
"dommage",
"dommage
personal",
"dommage
patrimoniel".
our
brief
discusses
"dommage
materiel",
"dommage
moral".
those
type
concepts
are
understood
in
the
french
law.
they
were
understood
in
1929
when
the
convention
was
drafted.
but
"lesion
corporelle"
is
a
term,
not
necessarily
a
french
legal
term.
it's
no
more
a
french
legal
term
than
a
cut
on
the
arm
is
a
legal
term
in
this
country.
and
"lesion
corporelle"
means
an
injury
to
a
bodily
part
or
bodily
organ,
and
we
simply
ask
that
it
be
interpreted
as
such.
with
regard
to
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
parties,
i
wanted
to
point
out,
number
1,
that
article
17
in
its
original
french
text
as
it
was
adopted
in
1929
is
what
governs
this
convention
today.
there's
been
no
change
in
it.
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
notification
to
passengers
as
required
by
the
montreal
agreement.
the
term
"personal
injury"
was
substituted.
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
the
use
of
personal
injury
is
not
inconsistent--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--well--
mr.
john
michael
murray
--justice
stevens,
if
you
remove
warsaw
from
the
consideration
and
you
put
this
in
a
simple
negligence
context,
the
term
"personal
injury"
is
bandied
about
by
lawyers
and
judges
and
it
has
the
connotation
legally
of
being
no
recovery
in
simple
negligence
cases
where
there
is
mental
injury
unaccompanied
by
physical
manifestation.
and
that's
all
we're
asking
that
this
term...
that
this
convention
be
interpreted
as
and
we
think
that
the
use
of
the
term
"personal
injury"
in
a
notice
context
is
consistent
with
that.
and
professor
lowenfeld,
who
was
the
attendee
of
the
united
states
at
the
montreal
agreement
said,
and
this
is
quoted
in
floyd
at
page
1474,
that
no
significance
should
be
attached
to
the
use
of
the
word
"personal
injury".
so
it
was
not
the
framers'
intention
in
1929,
it
was
not
the
delegates'
intention
in
montreal
in
1966
to
change
the
meaning
of
article
17.
in
sum,
we
feel
that
compensable
injuries
under
the
warsaw
convention
should
very
clearly
include
only
injuries
where
there
is
a...
an
objective,
palpable,
physical
injury
and
that
the
warsaw
convention
should
be
the
exclusive
vehicle
for
recovery
for
passengers
in
international
air
transportation.
thank
you.
