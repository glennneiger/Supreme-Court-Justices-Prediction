we'll
hear
next
in
no.
89-1598,
eastern
airlines
v.
rose
marie
floyd.
mr
murrary
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
see.
so
the
addition
of
"tout
autre
lesion
corporelle"
broadens
the
liability
of
the
carrier
over
what
it
would
be
with
just
"cas
de
mort,
de
blessure?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
certainly
would
get
some
presumably
legitimate
claims
of
emotional
distress,
not
feigned,
that
would
be
thrown
out
under
this
line
of
reasoning.
chief
justice
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
struck
me,
mr.
murray,
that
both
the...
your
brief
and
the
respondents'
brief
were
quite
lacking
in
any
french
interpretations
of
what
this
term
would
have
meant
at
the
time
the
warsaw
convention
was
adopted.
i
assume
maybe
that
that
was
because
there
just
weren't
any.
chief
justice
rehnquist
"lesion
corporelle".
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
read
through
cases
construing
the
code
napoleon
then
and
find
no
use
of
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
question
is
fairly
presented
by
your
question
presented
for
certiorari,
mr.
murray?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let,
let
me
read
you...
your
question
presented
which
of
course
it
at
the
first
page
of
your
brief,
whether
in
view
of
the
presumed
liability
under
warsaw
convention
for
death,
wounding,
or
any
other
bodily
injury,
an
air
carrier
is
liable
for
fright,
psychic
injury,
or
emotional
distress,
absent
objective
bodily
injury
or
absent
any
physical
manifestation
of
injury.
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
question
presented
in
your
petition.
and
do
you
think
that
the
question
you're
now
talking
about
is
fairly
subsumed
under
that
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
murray.
we'll
hear
now
from
mr.
eaton.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
felt
that,
i
felt
that
was
lacking,
too,
in
any
discussion
of
contemporary
french
law
at
the
time
of
the
warsaw
convention
was
adopted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
dr.
mankiewicz
in
his
treatise
discuss
french
personal
injury
law--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--as
of
the
vintage
of
the
warsaw
convention?
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
dr....
many
of
dr.
mankiewicz's
reasons
for
reaching
this
conclusion
are
incorporated
into
section
3
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
basically,
he
says
there
is
no
concept
in
french
civil
law
which
relates
to
the
words
1929
saying
dr.
mankiewicz,
were
"dommage
personal",
"dommage
patrimoniel",
non-economic
damages,
economic
damages.
then
why
would
the
drafters
use
a
phrase
like
that?
if
it
didn't
mean
anything
in
the
french
legal
world?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did,
did
he
deduce
that
i
take
it
not
from
french
legal
authorities
which
you
say
didn't
even
use
the
term,
but
simply
from
a
translation
from
the
french?
chief
justice
rehnquist
simple
turbulence
causing
an...
causing
injury
is
not
recoverable
because
it's
not
an
accident?
chief
justice
rehnquist
work...
the
courts
in
workmen's
compensation
cases,
at
least
in
the
days
when
i
practiced
law,
have
been
very
hard
put
to
define
an
accident,
which
most
state
statutes
for
workmen's
compensation
use,
injury
arising
out
of
accident.
very
hard
put
to
define
the
term
accident
as
having
any
significant
limitation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
theory
of
dr.
mankiewicz
being
that
the
drafters
had
intended
to
come
up
with
something
that
was
recognized
in
french
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what,
what
does
31(c)
deal
with?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
montreal
convention
was
in
english?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eaton.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
murray,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
murray.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
three
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
