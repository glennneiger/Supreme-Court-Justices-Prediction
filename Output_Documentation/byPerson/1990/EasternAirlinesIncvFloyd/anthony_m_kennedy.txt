not
all
of
them?
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
not
all
of
the
passengers?
justice
kennedy
and
the
emotional
injury
can
be
compensable
even
though
it
results
from
causes
unrelated
to
the
cut?
justice
kennedy
because
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
"any
other"
might
relate
"lesion
corporelle"
to
wounding
or
death.
justice
kennedy
i'm
just
referring
to
the
words
"de
tout
autre".
would
your
case
be
just
as
strong
or
just
as
weak
without
those
words?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
could
have
eliminated
those.
it
just
could
have
said
"au
lesion
corporelle".
justice
kennedy
so
that
has
no
effect
on
your
case?
justice
kennedy
of
course
the
absolute
liability
came
into
effect
with
the
montreal
treaty--
justice
kennedy
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
irrelevant.
we're
interpreting
the
warsaw
convention
as
it
was
intended
and
drafted
when
there
was
i
take
it
some
showing
of
fault.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
point
still
is
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
warsaw
convention
you
were
subject
to
strict
liability.
justice
kennedy
suppose
there's
heavy
turbulence
and
a
passenger
falls
and
has
a
fracture.
recoverable?
justice
kennedy
what
is
your
position?
justice
kennedy
i'm
still
not
sure
what
your
answer
it?
justice
kennedy
i
want
to
know
your
position.
justice
kennedy
there's
turbulence
and
it
causes
a
fracture.
recoverable
under
the
warsaw
convention?
