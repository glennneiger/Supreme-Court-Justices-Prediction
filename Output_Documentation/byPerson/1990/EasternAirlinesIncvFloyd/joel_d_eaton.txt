mr.
joel
d.
eaton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
chief
justice
observed
that
the
briefs
were
lacking
in
a
discussion
of
the
french
civil
law
background,
and
i
thought
i
was
doing
the
court
a
favor.
what
i
did
was
adopt
section
3
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
as
my
primary
argument
on
that
point.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
the
eleventh
circuit's
analysis
is
drawn
almost
entirely,
maybe
75
percent,
from
a
book
written
by
professor
or
dr.
rene
mankiewicz
of
mcgill
university,
who
from
my
reading
on
this
subject
is
considered
the
single
leading
expert
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
language
in
the
warsaw
convention.
his
conclusion
and
the
eleventh
circuit's
conclusion
was
that
the
phrase
"lesion
corporelle"
is
not
appropriately
translated
into
the
terms,
the
english
phrase
"bodily
injury".
and
the
bottom
line
that
both
dr.
mankiewicz
proposed
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
the
phrase
should
more
appropriately
been
translated
into
the
phrase
"personal
injury"
in
the
english
language.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
dr.
mankiewicz's
opinion
was
that
the
phrase
meant
something
broader
than
either
"dommage
personal"
or
"dommage
patrimoniel".
it
meant
the
concept
that
the
english
law
has
which
is
personal
injury,
a
broad,
a
broad...
any
type
of
injury
suffered
by
a
passenger
in
an,
in
an
international
air
carrier
accident.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no,
he
deduced
it
from
a
number
of
facts,
your
honor,
one
of
which
was
that
the
french
civil
law
simply
did
not
recognize
the
distinction
that
mr.
murray
has
asked
the
court
to
read
into
or
impose
upon
article
17.
there
is
no
concept
either
in
1929
or
today
in
the
french
civil
law.
dr.
mankiewicz
cites
five
or
six
french
court
decisions
in
his
1981
treatise.
there
is
no
concept
in
the
french
civil
law
that
you
have
to
have
a
physical
injury
or
a
physical
impact
before
you're
entitled
to
recover
damages
for
your
mental
distress.
that,
dr.
mankiewicz--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--there
are
cases
in
the
french
civil
law
and
in
the
napoleonic
code,
as
mr.
murray
has
conceded.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
most--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--most
respectfully,
justice
scalia,
the
english
common
law
recognized
and
has
recognized
for
centuries
various
tortious
causes
of
action
for
the
recovery
solely
of
mental
injuries,
the
law
of
defamation
for
one.
there
are
no
physical
injuries
involved
in
a
liable
or
a
slander.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
a
negligent
assault,
negligent
defamation--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--you
have...
negligence--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
impact
rule
is
in
my
reading
of
it
designed
for
a
very
narrow
purpose.
that
is
where
the
interest
is
in
the
protection
of
physical
security
alone.
physical
security
is
threatened,
but
there
has
been
no
injury.
then
typically,
solely
as
a
matter
of
judicial
philosophy
and
to
draw
an
arbitrary
line
between
the
probably
significant
and
the
probably
trivial,
the
impact
rule
is
imposed
to
prevent
claims
from
negligent
infliction
of
mental
distress,
been
relaxed
all
over
this
country
in
numerous
contexts
in
cases
of
aggravated
conduct
where
common
carriers
are
involved,
in
cases
where
the
most
likely
injury,
the
most
probable
injury
of
the
conduct
which
is
recognized
as
tortious
is
mental
distress
where
there's
no
physical
injury
threatened
by
the
tort.
for
example,
the
negligent
mishandling
of
a
dead
body
has
long
been
actionable
in
english
common
law.
the
relatives
are
allowed
to
recover
their
mental
distress...
no
physical
injury--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
mental
injury,
your
honor,
is
the
terror--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
terror
at
the
thought
that
they
were
all
going
to
die,
which
lasted
for
several
minutes
during
the
descent.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
accident
in
that
case.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
and
air
planes
don't
do
that.
they
don't
fall
10,000
feet.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no,
your
honor,
turbulence
is
an
expected
event
in
aviation.
turbulence
is
up
there
because
the
gulf
stream...
not
the
gulf
stream...
the
jet
stream
causes
turbulence,
the
build
up
of
cumulus
clouds
into
alta...
into--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--normal
and
expected
happenings
in
aviation.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
what
is
peculiar
about
this
case?
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
this
case
did
not
involve
a
signal
engine
failure
of
an
air--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--of
course
it
is.
that's
why
you
put
three
or
four
engines
on
the
airplane.
[laughter]
in
this
case,
all
of
the
engines
on
the
airplane...
well,
they're
not
expected
to
fail,
no.
they're
suppose
to
run
to
their
overhaul
time
and
then
be
overhauled,
put
back
on.
no,
they're
not
expected
to
fail
from
sloppy
maintenance.
but
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
single
engine
failure
that
mr.
murray
talked
about
is
that
all
of
the
engines
quit.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
where
the
engine
failed?
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
don't
believe,
no.
i
don't
believe
a
jury
would
compensate
you
in
that
case,
because
only
one
of
the
engines
failed,
which
is
the
reason
why
there
are
lots
of
engines
on
an
airplane.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
well,
all
the
engines
failed,
every
engine
on
this
airplane
failed.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
it's
not
just
the
terror
suffered
by
the
passengers
during
this
7
or
8-minute
period
when
they
all
thought
they
were
going
to
die.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
according
to
mr.
murray
it
is.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
don't
believe
it
makes
any
sense
to
read
that
complex
distinction
into
these
two
words,
"lesion
corporelle",
and
that's
basically
what
i've
argued.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
mr.
murray
says
the
phrase
"lesion
corporelle"
or
he
has
now
backed
it
up
several--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--okay,
my
position
is--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--i'm
sorry.
i
misheard
the
question.
no.
the
answer
is
no.
it
may
very
well
be
recoverable
under
some
other
local
law
that's
not
inconsistent
with
the
warsaw
convention
if
you
can
prove
fault
in
that
the
pilot
flew
into
an
area
of
known
turbulence,
for
example,
against
the
advice
of
the
faa.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
don't
believe
it's
an
accident,
your
honor.
it's
not...
it's
a
normal
expected
event
in
flight.
you
cannot
avoid
turbulence
in
flight.
you
can't
see
it.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
it's
very
rare,
because
the
commercial
airlines
are,
are
very
careful
about
skirting
those
areas
in
which
they
can
project
and
product
turbulence.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
turbulence
is
not
rare.
turbulence
is
up
there
right
now.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
well,
it,
you
know,
that's
not
something
that--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--it
may
be
an
accident.
it
may
be
an
accident.
i
took
the
position
that
minor
incidence
of
encounters
with
turbulence
were
not,
because
you
needed
something
that
was
serious,
sudden,
unexpected--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--unexpected--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--unexpected
turbulence?
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
believe
you
would
because
of
the
serious
nature
of
the
incident.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
suppose
my
aviation
background
has
caused
me
to
take
a
position
that
probably
i
shouldn't
have
taken.
i've
been
flying
for
25
years.
every
time
i
get
in
an
airplane
i
run
into
turbulence.
it's
not
a
serious
thing
to
me.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
commercial
airlines
spend
a
lot
of
time
avoiding
areas
in
which
they
can
predict
turbulence,
and
generally
when
a
commercial
airliner
gets
in
a
situation
where
the
turbulence
is
so
severe
and
it
hasn't
alerted
people
to
the
need
to
wear
the
seatbelt
and
somebody
gets
physically
hurt,
that's
probably
an
accident
within
the
lay
or
even
jurisprudential
construction
of
the
statute.
but
there's
no
harm
done
here,
because
what
we've
got
is
essentially
like
of
workers'
compensation
system.
there
is
a
cap
on
damages
here
at
$75,000,
and
there's
a
tradeoff.
hey,
we'll
give
you
strict
liability
for
anytime
you
get
hurt
in
an
accident
in
an
airplane,
you
give
us
a
cap
on
the
damages.
so
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
suggesting
that
turbulence
can
be
covered
here.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
well,
the
court
took
a
stab
at
that
in
the
air
france
v.
saks
case
and
did
define
it
to
exclude
things
that
happened
internally
to
the
passenger.
but
the
definition
of
accident
that
the
court
came
up
with
in
air
france
v.
saks
is
very
broad.
but
let
me
get
back
to
the
french
legal
meaning,
because
that's
the
technical
question
before
the
court.
the
conclusion
of
dr.
mankiewicz
and
a
number
of
other
scholars
which
are
not
cited
in
my
brief
but
are
collected
in
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
and
the
eleventh
circuit
was
that
the
phrase
lesion
corporelle
simply
didn't
translate
well
into
bodily
injury.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
dr.
mankiewicz
reached
that
conclusion.
one
was
that
the
french
civil
law
did
not
recognize
the
distinction
which
the
common
law
impact
rule
imposes
on
court
actions,
and
therefore,
who
would
have
expected
in
1929
that
the
drafters
of
the
treaty
could
have
come
up
with
something
like
that.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no,
his
conclusion
was
that
by
using
a
phrase
"lesion
corporelle",
they
meant
something
broader
than
the
narrower
concepts
recognized,
"dommage
personal",
"dommage
patrimoniel",
"materiel",
or
"moral",
that
they
wanted
something
broader
and
what
they
were
after
was--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--no.
broad
as
the
english
concept
of
personal
injury,
which
incidentally
is
the
word
that
all
the
subsequent
revisions
of
the
warsaw
convention
have
used,
which
is
down
there
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
of
reasons
for
the
eleventh
circuit's
construction.
dr.
mankiewicz
was
also
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
german
delegate
to
the
convention
went
back
and
translated
the
official
german
translation
of
the
warsaw
convention,
rendered
the
phrase
"lesion
corporelle"
as
"any
infringement
on
the
health
of
a
passenger.
"
and
the
german
translation
is
now
used
in
germany,
austria,
and
switzerland...
much
broader
than
the
english
bodily
injury.
he
also
looked
to
a
thesis
written
by
a
student,
george
ripert,
who
was
the
french...
leading
french
delegate
and
the
drafter
of
this
convention.
and
the
blanc-dannery
thesis,
written
under
the
supervision
of
dean
ripert,
states
that
article
17
is
broad
enough
to
cover
nervous
troubles
arising
out
of
an
accident.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
your
honor.
the
damages
may
not
be
great,
and
we're
not
here
saying
each
of
these
passengers
is
entitled
to
a
million
dollars.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
but
the
more
important
damages,
and
i
didn't
get
to
answer
that
question
about
what
the
damages
the
passenger
have
sustained
in
this
case.
there
are
two
passengers
who
suffered
physical
sequelae
which
give
you
a
recovery
even
under
mr.
murray's
theory.
there
are
several
of
these
passengers
who
will
testify
that
this
event
was
so
terrifying
to
them
that
they
have
never
been
able
to
fly
on
an
airplane
again.
that's
an
ongoing,
permanent,
perhaps,
mental
injury.
there
are
people
who
have
nightmares,
fear
of
flying,
the
whole
panoply
of
damages
that
you
might
expect
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
physical
sequelae
of
a
mental
distress--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--which
they
say
the
common
law
impact
rule
does
not
exclude.
in
this
case
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
a
pregnant
woman
who
gave
birth
prematurely
as
a
result
of
the
mental
stress.
the
baby
was
blind
and
retarded
as
a
result
of
the
premature
delivery.
eastern
did
not
contest
that
claim.
that
claim
was
litigated
and
my
understanding
is
that,
that
they
have
collected
their
$75,000
in
that
case.
so
there
is
a
panoply
of
damages
which
can
occur
to
people
put
in
this
situation.
it
may
be
that
some
of
these
claims
will
be
awarded
zero
damages.
a
single-engine
failure,
minor
turbulence,
whatever.
a
jury
is
not
going
to
compensate
you
for
it.
but
that's
not
a
reason
to
exclude
legitimate
cases
of
people
who
flew
for
a
living
and
can
no
longer
fly
as
a
result
of
the
terror
that
they
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
inexcusable
incident.
it
was
just
poor,
sloppy
maintenance,
which
the
eleventh
circuit
has
held
the
allegations
of
our
complaint
are
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
willful
and
wanton
misconduct.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
contracting
parties,
because
this
is
a
very
important
aspect--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--well--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--he's
not
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
so
he
did
not
say
this
is
what
the
language
means.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
it
was
a
scholarly
opinion.
it
was
his
opinion.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
waffling
to
some
extent.
[laughter]
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
question
is
troublesome.
the
phrase
is
ambiguous
and
the
drafting
history
is
not
very
helpful.
mr.
murray
says
it's
clear
and
unambiguous.
i
think
everybody
here
will
disagree
with
that.
but,
no,
what
he
says
is
that
it
is
ambiguous,
it
is
not
clear,
but
i
conclude,
my
opinion
is
based
on
all
these
things
that
the
phrase
"lesion
corporelle"
is
more
appropriately
translated
into
the
english
concept
of
personal
injury.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
then--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--no,
he
said
what
you
said.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i'm
paraphrasing
it.
but
let's
turn
to
the
subsequent
conduct.
mr.
murray
talks
about
a
1951
meeting
in
madrid
at
which
absolutely
nothing
happened,
nothing
came
out
of
it.
it
was
an
interim
meeting
at
which
some
people
proposed
probably
to
cure
the
ambiguity
that
mental
injury
be
made
more
specific
in
article
17,
but
nothing
happened.
what
did
happen
in
1955
at
the
hague
is
that
article
31(c)
was
redrafted
and
proposed
as
an
amendment
to
the
warsaw
convention.
and
it
translated
the
phrase,
"mort,
blessure,
ou
de
toute
autre
lesion
corporelle.
"
into
death
or
personal
injury.
and
that
sits
today
as
article
31(c)
of
the
amendments
adopted
at
the
hague.
now,
in
the--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--31(c)
deals
with
the
legend
that
has
to
be
put
on
the
passenger
ticket,
and
it
says
you've
got
to
tell
the
passenger
about
the
limitations
on
his
right
of
action
to
recover
for
death
or
personal
injury.
now
in
1966
in
montreal,
after
the
united
states
government
denounced
this
treaty
because
it
had
a
$8,300
cap
on
the
recoverability
of
damages,
the
airlines
got
together
and
they
decided
to
raise
their
limits,
accept
strict
liability,
which
was
not
initially
written
into
the
warsaw
convention.
it
was
a
negligence
action
although
the
burden
of
proof
was
shifted
to
the
carrier
to
prove
non-negligence
rather
than
the
traditional.
and
in
exchange
for
all
of
those,
the
airlines
also
agreed
to
put
on
the
face
of
their
ticket
an
advice
to
the
passenger
which
advised
them
of
their
limitations
of
liability.
in
all
the
discussions
and
the
written
documents
produced
at
the
montreal
agreement,
the
phrase
bodily
injury
and
personal
injury
are
used
interchangeably
without
distinguishing
between
the
two.
they
appear
almost
an
equal
number
of
times
in
the
montreal
agreement.
the
two
phrases
appear
and
are
used
interchangeably
in
the
cab
order
which
adopted
or
approved
the
montreal
agreement.
and
the
passenger
ticket
which
is
now
issued
to
all
passengers
getting
on
a
carrier
in
international
air
transportation
advises
them
of
the
limitations
of
the
carrier's
liability
in
case
of
death
or
personal
injury.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
hesitated
only
because
i'm
not
absolutely
certain,
but
i'm
pretty
sure
it
is.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
say
that
again,
sir.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
on
the
ticket
itself.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
well,
the
airlines
agreed
to
do
that
in
the
montreal
agreement,
and
now
the
agreement
itself
requires
that
that--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--in
any
event
it
is
now
required
for
whatever
reason--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--okay.
i
had
to--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
limitation
on
the
passenger
tickets
is
described
as
a
limitation
on
the
damages,
and
i
can't
quote
it,
because
i
don't
have
it
handy,
for
any
cause
of
action
you
may
have
for
death
or
personal
injury.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
it
says
you
have
a
$75,000
limit
on
any
action
you
have
for
death
or
personal
injury
arising
out
of
international
air...
an
accident
in
international
air
transportation.
i
wish
i
could
quote
it.
i
don't
have
it.
the
tickets
for
some
of
these
passengers
are
in
the
record
before
the
court.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no,
because
death
or
personal...
personal
injury
is
a
much
broader
concept
than
bodily
injury.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
that's
not
inconsistent,
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
english
translation
of
"lesion
corporelle"
into
bodily
injury
is
not
necessarily
the
correct
translation
of
the
phrase,
and
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
parties
recognizes
that
it
is
more
appropriately
translated
into
the
broader
concept
of
personal--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
whole
problem
i
have
with
eastern's
position
is
that
this
very
complex
distinction
represented
by
the
common
law's
impact
rule
can't
be
spelled
out
of
the
language
in
article
17.
it
takes
a
whole
paragraph
to
explain
the
distinction
between
you
get
mental
damages
if
you
have
a
physical
injury
but
you
don't
get
mental
damages
if
you
don't
have
a
physical
impact
unless
you
have
some
physical
sequelae
arising
out...
you
can't
read
all
of
that
into
there
and,
therefore,
to
draft
the
ticket
provision
the
way
eastern
wants
this
article
17
read,
you're
going
to
need
another
page.
the
point
is--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--that
although
the
state
department
translated
"lesion
corporelle"
into
bodily
injury,
it
has
routinely
been
translated
into
the
broader
phrase,
personal
injury,
by
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
parties.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
they
did
not
in
1955.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
my
understanding
of
those
two
early
discussions
of
the
problem
was
that
the
people...
the
delegates
thought
that
there
was
some
ambiguity
here
and
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
removed
the
ambiguity.
but
there
was
not--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--perhaps
the
history--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
history
is
not
particularly
specific
about
the
reason
why
the
amendments
were
voted
down.
it
may
very
well--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--well,
there
is
also
some
discussion
in
the
materials
that
i
read
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
specify
it
any
further
because
it
was
included
within
the
concept
of
"lesion
corporelle".
let's
go
to
1971
and
1975,
because
in
the
guatemala
city
protocol
and
the
in
the
montreal
protocols
3
and
4,
neither
of
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
united
states.
article
17
of
the
french
was
not
changed,
but
for
the
first
time
the
warsaw
signatories,
delegates,
drafted
an
authentic
english
version
of
article
17.
this
is
not
the
state
department's
translation
in
1934
now,
but
an
authentic
english
version
of
article
17
which
translates
the
phrase
"lesion
corporelle",
which
remains
in
the
french
version
as
personal
injury...
death
or
personal
injury.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
the
senate
has
never
adopted--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--any
of
these
subsequent
amendments
because--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--it's
absolutely
not
binding,
your
honor,
but
it
is
evidence
of
the
subsequent
construction
of
the
intent
of
the
framers
in
1929
that
the
delegates
keep
coming
to
these
conventions
and
assume
that
dr.
mankiewicz
opines
that
it
means
and
that
is
personal
injury
and
the
court
in
the
air
france
v.
saks
case
is
looking
to
the
death...
for
finding
the
definition
of
accident,
looked
at
the
guatemala
city
protocol
and
the
montreal
protocols
3
and
4
for
that
kind
of
evidence.
let
me
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
common
laws
impact
rule
at
this
point
in
our
history
leads
to
some
rather
strange
and
silly
torturing
of
the
facts
in
order
to
get
cases
into
court.
i
sent
up
some
supplemental
material
on
the
united
811
flight,
the
747
which
lost
the
cargo
door
and
sucked
9
people
out.
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
in
order
to
get
around
mr.
murray's
impact
rule
and
his
construction
of
article
17,
alleged
and
i
imagine
they
can
prove
that
they
all
inhaled
some
insulation
fibers
that
were
circulating
about
the
cabin,
that
they
got
struck
with
small
pieces
of
debris,
and
that
they
were
scared
to
death.
now,
if
the
impact
rule
applies,
those
plaintiffs
get
a
recovery
for
their
mental
distress
because
they
inhaled
some
insulation
fibers
because
there
was
a
physical
impact.
but
the
clients
in
my
case,
who
were
just
as
scared
as
those
people,
do
not.
and
justice
o'connor
mentioned
the
fact
that
if
somebody
cut
their
finger
here
or
i
would
add
bumped
their
head
during
the
getting
ready
for
the
ditching
process,
they
have
a
physical
impact
or
a
physical
injury
which
will
support
a
recovery
of
their
mental
distress
damages.
but
the
person
sitting
next
to
them
who
was
more
careful
in
putting
on
his
life
vest
and
getting
his
head
between
his
knees,
does
not.
and
i
don't
think
that
makes
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
i've
also
suggested
in
the
brief,
most
respectfully,
that
a
mental
injury
is
a
bodily
injury,
an
injury
to
the
brain.
we
now
understand
an
awful
lot
more
about
the
brain
than
we
did
60
years
ago.
it
is
a
biochemical
organ
like
other
organs
and
when
you
suffer
anxiety,
freight,
neuroses
that
arise
out
of
these
things,
those
are
biochemical
disorders
to
a
bodily
organ.
and
i
would
submit
that
a
mental
injury
in
our
present
understanding
is
in
fact
a
physical
injury.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
that
seems--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--well,
that's
not
an
injury,
high
blood
pressure.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
that
would
be
a
normal
injury
aging
process.
sure.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
well,
post-traumatic
disorder
suffered
by
vietnam
veterans
is
recognized
mental
injury
as
i
understand
it
because
the
body
chemistry--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
brain's
chemistry
has
been...
gone
out
of
whack.
it's
been
adjusted
or
readjusted
or
whatever
so
that
people
have
neuroses
that
are
treatable
by
chemicals.
paranoia,
psychoses,
things
like
that
are
all
created
by
chemicals.
i
don't
mean--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--if
it--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--if
it
is
caused
by
the
stress
of
a
terrifying
incident
and
you
have
medical
expert
testimony
that
will
relate
the
permanent
mental
injury,
the
stress,
the
psychoses,
the
neuroses,
or
whatever
to
this
incident,
yes,
i
think
it
is
caused
by
the
incident.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
thank
you.
