justice
marshall
was
the
mental
injury,
the
fact
that
they
were
about
to
crash?
what
was
the
mental
injury?
justice
marshall
you
might,
you
might
say
you
won't
talk
about
it.
justice
marshall
now,
a
plane
is
going
from
one
coast
to
the
other
coast
and
it
falls
down
10,000
feet,
will
those
people
have
injury?
justice
marshall
huh?
justice
marshall
i
know
it
was
no
accident,
but
it
fell
10
feet
and
it
felt
like
it
was
going
to
be
an
accident.
justice
marshall
thunder
and
lightning...
does
that
do
it?
justice
marshall
what
does
it?
what
is
peculiar
about
this
one?
justice
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
--i've
been
on
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
planes
where
an
engine
fell
out.
justice
marshall
you
mean
i
lost
some
money?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
xxx
on
a
four
motor
and
three
of
them
went
out.
justice
marshall
oh,
well.
oh,
that's
what
kept
me
from
getting
any
money?
i
see.
[laughter]
justice
marshall
i'm
just
worried
about
the
money
i've
lost.
justice
marshall
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
requires
that
that
be
posted,
that
the
limitations
must
be
put
on
the
counter
of
the
airline.
justice
marshall
that
wasn't
voluntary.
that
was
required.
justice
marshall
it
needed
a
court
case
to
do
it.
justice
marshall
if
you
ever
read
the
opinion,
just
read
who
wrote
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
one
of
these
is
eastern
airlines
versus
floyd
no.
89-1598.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
article
17
of
the
warsaw
convention
sets
forth
conditions
for
liability
of
international
air
carriers
for
injuries
to
passengers.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
passengers
who
suffered
only
mental
distress
or
emotional
injury
from
an
airplane
accident
can
recover
on
article
17.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
article
17
does
not
allow
recovery
for
purely
mental
injuries.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
