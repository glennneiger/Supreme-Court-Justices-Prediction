mr.
murray,
they,
they
argue
in
response
that
the
requirement
of
an
accident
imposes
some
kind
of
a
limit
on
the
danger
that
every
time
you
get
in
a
rainstorm,
you
have
a
lot
of
claims.
would
you
comment
on
the
force
of
that
argument?
justice
stevens
i
thought
so
and
although
the
respondents'
brief
in
this
case
suggests
that
a
turbulence
encounter
is
not
an
accident
as
i
recall
it.
justice
stevens
and
beyond
that,
hasn't
the
florida
court
held
there's
not
state
law
cause
of
action
here
anyway?
justice
stevens
so
what
do
want
us
to
preempt?
justice
stevens
that's
an
accident,
isn't
it?
unexpected
turbulence.
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
your
seatbelt
on,
you're
thrown
against
the
ceiling,
and
you're
killed.
you
have
no
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
but
it
has
to
be
an
accident
for
you
to
have
a
recovery,
doesn't
it?
i
thought
it
was
everybody
agreed
there
was
unexpected
turbulence
that
caused
physical
harm
that
that
was
(a)
an
accident,
(b)
it
was
covered
by
the
treaty.
justice
stevens
you
fly
higher
than
i
do.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
broader
than
any
of
those?
justice
stevens
let
me
pause
there
if
i
may.
you
say
any
german
translates
that
any
infringement
on
the
health
of
the
person.
would
just
the
period
of
intense
fright
for
5
minutes
with
no
subsequent
consequences
qualify
under
that?
justice
stevens
but
you
think
that
being
frightened
for
a
minute
with
no
after
effects
would
be
an
infringement
on
your
health
within
the
meaning--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
this...
i
don't
know
maybe
i
should
ask
your
opponent
this.
supposing
a
person...
a
passenger
was
so
frightened
that
he
or
she
had
a
heart
attack...
no
physical...
would
that
be...
would
they
agree
that
would
be
recoverable?
justice
stevens
i
see.
okay.
justice
stevens
no,
it's
not
inconsistent,
but
there's
a
question
i
think
as
to
whether
it's
an
adequate
disclosure
if
it
doesn't
tell
the
passenger
that
there's
one
category
of
personal
injuries
as
to
which
there's
no
recovery.
justice
stevens
that's
the
question,
whether
it's
an
adequate
disclosure.
