justice
o'connor
mr.
murray,
if
a...
if
a
passenger
in
an
accident
covered
by
the
warsaw
convention
did
suffer
some
physical
injury
such
as
a
cut
on
the
leg
in
the
course
of
whatever
happened
in
the
air,
but
also
says
that
there
were
emotional
injuries
suffered
as
well,
can
the
damages
cover
both
the
injury
to
the
leg
and
the
emotional
trauma?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
because
those
emotional
injuries
are
incorporated
under
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"
as
a
matter
of
law
in
france?
justice
o'connor
why
do
you
say
that
the
emotional
injury
in
the
case
i
posed
is
recoverable?
justice
o'connor
under
what
language
of
the
warsaw
convention
is
it
covered?
justice
o'connor
and
that
would
include
the
emotional
injury?
justice
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
that
the
term
"lesion
corporelle"
requires
as
a
condition
precedent
some
physical
injury
to
the
body?
justice
o'connor
now
at
the
so-called
guatemala
accords,
which
have
not
yet
been
approved
i
gather
in
this
country--
justice
o'connor
--would
the
meaning
change
under
the
convention?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
eaton,
i
thought
in
1955
that
the
delegates
did
not
change
the
language
of
article
17.
justice
o'connor
and
i
thought
also
that
in
1955,
there
actually
was
an
amendment
proposed
to
article
17
to
make
it
say
any
other
mental
or
bodily
injury
and
that
was
rejected
by
the
delegates.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
decision
was
not
to
amend
it
to
include
mental
or--
justice
o'connor
--bodily
injury
in
1955.
justice
o'connor
it's
because
the
greek
delegation
didn't
want
to
make
that
change.
justice
o'connor
and
we
haven't
agreed
to
that?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
but
you
think
it's
binding
on
us
somehow?
