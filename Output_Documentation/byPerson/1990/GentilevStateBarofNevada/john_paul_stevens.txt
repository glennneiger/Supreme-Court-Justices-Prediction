justice
stevens
--is
it
undisputed
that
he
purpose
was
to
prejudice
jurors?
justice
stevens
he
could
have
had
his
secretary
do
this
though,
right?
or
he
could
have
had
the
investigator,
that
he
had
had
look
into
this,
have
a
press
conference?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
go
back
to
justice
souter's
hypothetical
for
a
moment
then.
assume
a
sequestered
jury...
does
the
rule
not
apply
to
anything
that
might
be
said
on
television
during
a
trial
then?
justice
stevens
no,
i
mean
what
is
your
view
of
this
rule?
justice
stevens
and
why?
because
of
the...
because
of
what
state
interest?
justice
stevens
if
the
jury
is...
is
safe
from
hearing
what's
said.
justice
stevens
but
you
would
rely
on
the
possibility
that
the
information
we
get
to
the
jury
even
in
that
situation?
justice
stevens
that...
i
really
am...
that's
what
i'm
really
asking.
are
you...
are
you
relying
on
that
dignity
there?
justice
stevens
but
if
that's
the
theory,
why
do
you
even
need
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prejudice
to
the
trial?
justice
stevens
why
is
it
prejudiced
to
the
dignity
of
the
profession
and
so
forth
enough?
justice
stevens
the
likelihood
of--
justice
stevens
--let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
of
the...
does
this
rule
only
apply
to
lawyers
who
are
representing
parties
to
pending
litigation?
what
about
the
lawyer
who
volunteers
to
go
on
the
tv
show
and
give
a
running
commentary
on
the
case?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
but
he
hasn't
argued
that
this...
his
standard
applies
to
direct
communication
between
the
lawyer
and
individual
jurors
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
or
even
individual
prospective
jurors
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
well,
that's--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
your
influence
on
the
proceeding
by
requiring
a
more
lengthy
voir
dire
than
you
would
otherwise
have
to
have
for
example.
supposing
it
were
rather
clear
that
the
prosecutor
had
sufficient
press
contact
to
stimulate
interest
that
would
require
an
extraordinarily
long
voir
dire
in
any
event.
would
you
then
say
that
the
defense
statement
had
to
have
even
more
extensive
voir
dire
or
would
he
then
be
immunized
from
that
particular
charge?
i
mean,
is
it
sort
of
a...
when
does
the...
when
is
the
defense
counsel
responsible
for
this
additional
voir
dire?
justice
stevens
well,
they
did
in
this
case.
they
were--
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
the
voir
dire
didn't
go
into
that
much
detail,
did
it?
didn't
it
just
ask
some...
what
you'd
read
about
the
case
and
what
you'd
heard
about
the
case?
justice
stevens
let
me
reframe
the
question.
in
this
particular
case,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
voir
dire
was
any
more
extensive
than
it
would
have
been
just
based
on
what
the
police
had
already
said
to
the
press?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
go
back
to
your
earlier
answer
to
one
of
my
questions
about
the...
his
motive
is
shown
by
the
fact
he
was
trying
to
counteract
the
already
widespread
information
about
the
case,
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
wasn't
requiring
any
more
knowledge
in
the
general
community
than
there
already
was.
justice
stevens
no,
it
isn't
that.
it's...
your
argument
is
that
his
conference
made
it
necessary
to
have
a
more
extensive
or...
the
danger
was
you
might
have
a
more
extensive
voir
dire
than
otherwise.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
already
needed
that
extensive
voir
dire
because
of
what
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
had
said,
isn't
that
a
response
to
the
concern?
justice
stevens
would
it...
would
it
have
violated
the
rule
if
you
had...
say
it
was
a
murder
case,
and
the
defense
lawyer
got
up
to
counteract
the
publicity...
highly
publicized
murder
case
and
said,
our
defense
is
going
to
be
alibi.
we
have
six
witnesses...
i'll
name
them...
who
will
testify
that
he
was
in
london
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
incident.
would
that
violate
the
rule?
justice
stevens
it
wouldn't
have
to
have
the
same
prejudicial
effect
we've
talked
about.
