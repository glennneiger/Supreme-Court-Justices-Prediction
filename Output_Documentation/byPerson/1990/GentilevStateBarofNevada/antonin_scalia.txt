justice
scalia
mr.
tigar,
suppose...
is...
is
there
no
interest
in
the
dignity
of
the
trial
process
that's
separate
and
apart
from
injuring
the
jury?
suppose
a
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
in
a
case
that
has
drawn
national
attention
decide
to
go
off
and
enact
the
trial
before
it
occurs
in
another
jurisdiction,
so
it
can't
possibly
infect
the
jury
in
the...
in
the
venue
where
the
case
is
to
be
tried.
must
the
courts
allow
that
simply
because
there's
no
problem
of
infecting
the
trial?
justice
scalia
it's
a
preenactment,
not
a
reenactment.
a
preenactment.
justice
scalia
for
those
interested
this
is
what
the
trial
is
going
to
look
like.
it's
a
circus.
justice
scalia
it
would?
my
goodness.
well,
why
would
it
be
undignified?
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
still
talking
about
a
lawyer.
mr.
tigar,
do
you
read
the
aba
rules
or...
or
the
rules
at
issue
here
as
applying
to
anyone
except
the
lawyer
including
his
staff?
i
mean
could...
could
perry
mason
say
to
della
street,
you
know,
della,
put
this
out.
our
client
is
getting
clobbered
in
the
press
or...
or
his
investigator
whoever
it
was,
you
know...
tell...
go
public
with
what
you've
found?
justice
scalia
would
that
violate
the
aba
rules?
justice
scalia
would
that
have
been
all
right
under
the
rule?
justice
scalia
through
the
acts...
so
he
couldn't...
he
couldn't
have
anybody
do
it?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
do...
do
the
aba
rules
contain
the
same...
proposals
contain
the
same
provision
or
is
that
of
nevada's
own
creation?
justice
scalia
mr.
klonoff,
i
guess
if
every
lawyer
went
around
saying,
i
really
believe...
honest,
deep
in
my
soul
that
my
client
is
innocent,
the
public
might
be
affected
by
the
lawyer
who
can't
say
that.
justice
scalia
you
know,
the
press
asks
him,
do
you
really
believe
deep
down
in
your
soul
that
your
client
is
innocent?
and
he
says,
no
comment.
[laughter]
that
might
be--
justice
scalia
--it
would
be
sort
of
hard
to
defend
guilty
people,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
that's
the
reason,
isn't
it?
because
if...
if...
if
you
do
that
the
lawyer
who
can't
do
it
is
prejudicing
his
client.
justice
scalia
mr.
klonoff,
why...
i'm
not
saying
that
i
disagree
with
part
2
of
the
rule,
but
i'm
not
sure
why
that
part
really
refers
to
matters
that
are...
that
are
ordinarily
likely
to
have
the
effect
of
a
substantial
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing
an
adjudicative
proceeding.
for
example,
why
does
it...
why
does
it...
why
is
it
limited?
it
is
ordinarily
likely
to
have
such
an
effect
when
it
refers
to
a
criminal...
a
criminal
matter
and
the
statement
relates
to.
is
there
any
limitation
on
what
a
lawyer
can
say
with
respect
to
civil
proceedings?
justice
scalia
well,
but
all
section
two
covers
is
criminal
matters,
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
does
it...
does
it
cover
civil
as
well?
i
just
have
the
excerpt
of
it
here.
justice
scalia
i
see.
if
it's
a
civil
matter
triable
to
a
judge,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
and
lawyers
can
do--
justice
scalia
--pretty
much
anything
unless
it's
like...
likely
to
influence
the
judge
which
it
shouldn't,
right?
justice
scalia
mr.
klonoff,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
the
only
basis
for
rules
like
this
is...
is
prejudicing
the
outcome,
but
i
must
say
that
i
read
your
rule
177
to
be
addressed
to
that.
it's
an
unusual
word...
materially
prejudicing.
i
mean
prejudge.
justice
scalia
but
you're...
you're
telling
us
that
that
language
embraces
something
other
than
causing
the...
causing
the
outcome
to
be
prejudged?
justice
scalia
and
it
includes
dignity
considerations
as
well.
justice
scalia
certainly
didn't
read
it
that
way.
never
mind
the
primary
one.
i'm--
justice
scalia
--you
say
it
goes
beyond
that.
