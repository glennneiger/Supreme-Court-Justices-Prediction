justice
souter
what...
what
would
the
answer
be
if
you
had
a
sequestered
jury
and
instead
of
a
court
attache
making
a
statement,
another
judge
of
the
same
bench
who
wasn't
presiding
over
the
trial
just
decided
to
engage
in
commentary
on
it?
he
went
to
the
press,
and
he
said
the
guy
is
obviously
guilty.
the
witnesses
are
lying.
i
sat
in
and
i
watched
for
a
while.
i've
heard
a
lot
of
witnesses.
i
can
tell.
same
standard,
clear
and
present
danger
standard?
justice
souter
but
there
is
no
value
whatsoever
in
the...
in
effect
in
the
public
appearance
of...
of
a
deliberative
process
of
justice?
justice
souter
right.
justice
souter
why
is
a
lawyer's
effect
on
that
appearance
so
much
less?
i
will
grant
you
it
is
less,
but
is
it
less
to
the
point
almost
of
insignificance,
which
was
the
impression
that
i
was
getting
from
your
earlier
answers?
justice
souter
could...
could
i
bring
you
back
though
to
this
question.
you
are...
you
are
agreeing
that
in
fact
there...
there
is
a
value
in
the
public
provision
of
a
deliberative
process,
and
that
that
value
in
fact
can
be
infringed
by
comments
whether
it
be
by
lawyers
or
by
judges
so
that
our
whole
test
is
not
simply
going
to
be
the
effect
on
the
jury.
now,
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
how
do
we...
how
do
we
as
a
practical
matter
apply
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
when
a
judge
or
a
lawyer
makes
a
statement
which
tends
to
suggest
or
cast
doubt
on
the
fairness
and
the
deliberativeness
of
the
process?
how
do
we
assess
the
clarity
and
the
presence
of
the
danger?
justice
souter
okay,
but
the
point
is
doesn't
the
harm
take
place
by
destroying
the
public,
if
not
general
or
universal
perception,
that
there
is
a
disciplined
and
rational
and
deliberative
process
that
is
going
to
go
on
in
the
courtroom?
doesn't
the...
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is
if
you
concede
that
these
values
are
appropriately
taken
into
consideration
in
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
then
don't
you
almost
have
to
say
as
a
practical
matter
that
once
these
kind
of
inflammatory
or
conclusory
statements
are
made
in
advance
of
trial,
that
the
test
really
has
been
satisfied,
because
there
has
to
that
extent
reasonably
been...
i
think
reasonably
perceived
to
be
a...
a
destruction
of
the
public
perception
about
the
process.
justice
souter
yes,
but
our...
the...
maybe
i
misunderstand
you.
i
thought
we
had
agreed
that
the
effect
on
jurors
was
not
the
sole...
the
sole
focus
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
test
once
we
assume
there
are
some
values
even
outside
the...
the
process
of
the
12
jurors
that
it
would
be
served
here.
justice
souter
so
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
interest
the
government
may
properly
protect
should
be
assessed
in
terms
of
countervailing
interests?
