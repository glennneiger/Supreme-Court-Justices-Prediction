justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
tigar,
here
we're
dealing
with,
i
suppose,
nevada
supreme
court
rule
177.
justice
o'connor
and
part
1
of
that
says
that
a
lawyer
shall
not
make
an
extra
judicial
statement
if
the
lawyers
knows
or
reasonably
should
know
that
it
will
have
a
substantial
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing
an
adjudicative
proceeding.
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
that
provision
is
invalid
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
justice
o'connor
and
is
this
provision,
part
1
of
rule
177,
rather
typical
of
what
many
states
have
in
their
rules
governing
attorney
conduct?
justice
o'connor
so
they're
all
invalid?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
part
2,
a
and
b,
present
a
somewhat
different
question.
and
i
was
trying
to
explore
with
you
initially
part
1
which
seems
to
be
a
more
typical
provision.
justice
o'connor
mr.
klonoff,
is...
is
the
second
part
of
rule
177
typical
of
state
bar
rules
around
the
country?
justice
o'connor
which
creates
sort
of
a
presumption
that
if
the
statement
relates
to
credibility
of
a
witness
or
a
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
o'connor
have
they
been...
have
they
been
operated
in
nevada
as
a
sort
of
presumption
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
was
done
here
notwithstanding
the
nevada
supreme
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
actual
prejudice?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
case
in
re
primus
speaks
at
all
to
the
standard
we
should
employ?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
ask
you
though
about
in
re
primus
which
i
thought
did
concern
discipline
of
an
attorney.
did
it
not?
