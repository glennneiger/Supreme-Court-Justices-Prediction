mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
submit
that
the
nevada
supreme
court's
private
reprimand
of
petitioner
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
first,
lawyers
in
pending
cases
are
officers
of
the
court
and
can
be
subject
to
certain
restrictions
that
could
not
be
imposed
on
the
press.
second,
nevada
rule
177,
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudice
standard,
captures
this
simple
premise
that
a
lawyer
should
not
be
allowed
to
try
his
case
on
the
press.
third,
the
rule
was
properly
applied
here
because
petitioner
called
the
press
conference
for
the
precise
purpose
of
prejudicing
prospective
jurors.
and
he
argued
extensively
concerning
the
credibility
and
character
of
the
government's
witnesses
and
on
other
matters.
now
petitioner
takes
the
position--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he
own
testimony
makes
that
absolutely
clear,
justice
stevens...
pages
41
to
42
of
the
joint
appendix,
45
of
the
joint
appendix,
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
56.
let
me
refer
as
one
example
to
page
56.
he
states,
"i
really
felt
that
the
whole
county
from
which
a
venire
would
be
polled
at
least
as
of
february
1988
had
been
poisoned,
okay?
"
"and
all
i
was
trying
to
do
was
even
it
out.
"
that's
a
clear
admission
that
he
was
trying
to
prejudice
the
venire.
and
by
the
way,
that
testimony
also
undercuts
a
major
premise
of
petitioner,
which
is
that
you
can't
prejudice
a
venire
6
months
prior
to
trial.
his
testimony
reveals
that
he
thought
the
police
long
before
the
6-month
period
had
already
prejudiced
the
venire.
so
how
can
he
then
come
in
and
say
that
his
comments,
later
than
the
police
comments,
could
not
have
prejudiced
the
proceedings.
so,
yes,
it
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
record
that
his
very
purpose
was
to
prejudice
the
proceeding.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
the...
actually,
justice
scalia--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
nevada
supreme
court
rule
203
provides
that
it's
professional
misconduct
for
a
lawyer
to
violate
any
rule
through
the
acts
of
another.
now--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
would
be
extremely
difficult,
let
me
say
as
a
practical
matter,
to
prove
a
violation
that
a
lawyer
was
somehow
setting
up
a
process--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--whereby
somebody
else
was
violating
the
rule.
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
in
which
a
lawyer
has
ever
been
disciplined
for
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
from
someone
else,
but
it
could
happen.
and
indeed--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--the
aba
rule...
model
rule
8.4(a)
contains
the
same
in
substance
provision.
let
me
also
say
that
from
the...
from
the
prosecutor's
standpoint,
rule
179.5
provides
that
the
prosecutor
must
exercise
reasonable
care
to
prevent
investigators,
law
enforcement
personnel,
employers,
and
other
persons
from
making
statements
that
would
be
prohibited
by
rule
177.
that
is
incorporated
in
model
rule
3.8.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes,
i
think
he
could
have.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
it
would
be
more
difficult
we
would
think.
the...
as
the
questions
of
the
court
to
mr.
tigar
reflect,
and
as
our
position
makes
clear,
there
is
something
unique
and
special
about
the
role
of
a
lawyer
as
an
officer
of
the
court.
and
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
try
to
deal
with
the
conduct
of
outsiders
or
third
parties.
and
certainly
the
bar
would
not
try
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
justice
marshall,
a...
much
more
than
that
was
said
at
the
press
conference.
in
fact,
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
think
that
in
some
circumstances,
depending
on
how
it's
said,
it
could
have
an
effect.
now,
here
in
fact
he
didn't
just
say
my
client--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
but
here...
here's
the
point--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
but
here's
the
point,
and
it
was
established
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
young.
there's
a
difference
in
saying,
my
client...
you
know,
the
evidence
will
show
that
my
client
is
innocent
versus
actually
vouching
for
innocence.
now,
what
mr.
gentile
did
here
is
he
went
so
far
as
to
say,
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
held
a
press
conference,
and
the
reason
i
did
so
is
because
i
believe
in
this
case
that
my
client
is
innocent.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--sure.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i
do
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
this
was
the
whole
thrust
of
this
court's
opinion
in
sheppard.
in...
in
1966,
this
court
in
sheppard
against
maxwell
identified
pretrial
publicity
as
being
a
problem
of
extraordinary
magnitude
and
in
essence
instructed
the
bar
to
go
out
and
do
something
to
correct
the
problem.
that
ultimately
led
first
to
the
disciplinary
rule.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
this
is
a
nevada--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
these
rules
are
nevada
supreme
court
rules;
they
were
adopted
by
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
problem
with
the
gag
rule--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
are
several--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--in
this
case,
no,
because
at
the
time
the
statements
were
made,
there
had
not
even
been
an
appearance
before
the
judge
who
was
going
to
try
the
case.
there...
there
are
enormous
problems
with
the
gag
order
if
i
could
just
go
through
those.
number
1,
if
the
gag
order
is
required
to
comport
with
mr.
tigar's--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
whole
purpose,
your
honor,
of
professional
standards
is...
is
to
identify
conduct
that
lawyers
should
hold
themselves
to.
it's
no
different...
you
could
have
a
case-by-case
determination
of
attorney-client
privilege
and
you
could
say
that
it's
okay
to
disclose
client
confidences
unless
in
a
particular
case
a
judge
orders
you
not
to.
that
would
be
cumbersome
and
it
really
wouldn't
make
sense
as
a
matter
of
procedure.
the
whole
reason
that
you
have
disciplinary
rules
is
because
lawyers
are
to
be
held
to
certain
standards.
and
these
standards
ought
to
apply,
we
submit,
in
every
case.
but
let
me
go
on
further
with
the
problems
of
the
gag
order
situation.
one
problem
with
the
gag
order
is
that
you're
not
going
to
be
dealing
with
all
those
other
situations
in
which
there's
pretrial
publicity.
even
if
a
gag
order
is
entered,
you're
going
to
have
myriad
appeals,
briefing.
the
levine
case
which
mr.
tigar
cites
in
his
reply
brief
is
a
perfect
example
where
you
have
a
mandamus
appeal...
extraordinary
briefing
on
that
case.
and
ultimately
what
the...
what
the
ninth
circuit
ended
up
doing
was
imposing
a
gag
order
that's
virtually
identical
to
model
rule
3.6.
so
what
you're
going
to
end
up
having
in...
in
any
event,
probably
from
the
gag
order
situation,
is
courts
adopting
rules
very
similar
to
3.6.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
true.
let--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
but
there
is...
the
united
states
against
young
has
made
clear
in
admonishing
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
lawyer
in
that
case
that
it
is
misconduct
to
vouch
for
your
client's
innocence
if
you're
the
defense
lawyer
or
if
you're
the
prosecutor
to
say
you--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--absolutely.
but...
and
let
me
say
one
thing
further
with
respect
to
all
these
comments
about
the
vouching.
the
principal
ground
upon
which
the
nevada
supreme
court
relied,
and
the
ground
that
the
bar
thinks
is
the
most
egregious
from
the
standpoint
of
this
press
conference
is
not
the
fact
that
mr.
gentile
said,
i
believe
my
client
is
innocent.
rather
it
is
the
several
pages
of
the
press
conference,
starting
on
page
8a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
where
he
talks
about
the
cover
up...
about
the
fact
that
one,
two,
four
of
the
victims
are
drug
dealers...
convicted
money
launderers...
known
drug
dealers.
didn't
say
a
word
about
anything
until
they
were
approached
by
metro
and
after
they
were
already
in
trouble
trying
to
work
themselves
out
of
something.
on
and
on
about
the
character,
credibility,
and
reputation
of
the
government's
witnesses.
no
one,
i
submit,
who
studied
model
rule
3.6
or
rule
177
the
night
before
could
have
believed
reasonably
that
those
kinds
of
comments
were
permitted
under
the
rule.
mr.
tigar
has
made
a
big
point
out
of
the
fact
that
his
client
studied
the
rule
the
night
before.
but
i
would
submit
that
no
reasonable
lawyer
could
have
concluded
that
those
types
of
comments
were
proper.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
it
is,
your
honor.
the
bar
rules
that
nevada
has
is
verbatim
from
model
rule
3.6,
which
is
the
rule
in
the
vast
majority
of
jurisdictions
with--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--let
me
say
they're
not
presumptions
in
an
evidentiary
sense.
what
they
are
are
guidelines.
they
are
things
that
ordinarily
would
cause
prejudice,
and
the
reason--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--not
as
an
evidentiary
presumption.
the
way
they
have
applied
both
in
nevada
and
the
courts
around
the
country
is
exactly
what
they
are.
they
are
guidance,
but
the
burden
is
still
on
the
bar
in
a
particular
case
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
there
was
a
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudice,
and
that
is
the
standard.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
oh,
absolutely.
there's
a
clear
difference
between
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prejudice
and
actual
prejudice.
if
a
court
or
a
bar
were
to
adopt
an
actual
prejudice
standard,
it
could
largely
nullify
the
rule.
for
example,
take
a
situation
in
which
there's
a...
just
a
press
conference
that
everyone
would
concede
is
just
outrageous.
it's
dealing
with
all
kinds
of
prejudicial
information.
and
then
for
some
reason
the
indictment
is
dismissed
or
a
guilty
plea
is
entered.
you
would
have
a
situation
there
where
the
argument
would
be
made
there
was
no
actual
prejudice,
because
the
indictment
was
dismissed
or
there
was
no
trial
or
whatever.
you
can't
have
a
rule
that
focuses
on
actual
prejudice.
you
have
to
look
at
the
time
the
statement
is
made
in
order
to
assess
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
think
that
that
the
standard,
your
honor,
in
terms
of...
of
the
balancing
test...
there...
there's
really
two
parts
to
the
question.
number
1,
what
is
the
balancing
test
that
gets
you
to
the
standard.
and
we'd
submit
that
that's
the
seattle
times/procunier
test
that
we
set
out
on
page
25
of
the
brief.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes,
it
did.
and...
and
the
primus
standard
is
certainly
relevant,
as
is
the
ohralik
standard.
let
me
note,
petitioner
in...
in
his
reply
brief
at
page
4
agrees
with
the
nevada
bar
in
terms
of
the
operative
standard.
they,
too,
recite
the
procunier
standard
as...
as
enunciated
in
seattle
times.
if
i
can
return,
justice
o'connor,
to
your
question...
these
guidelines
that
are
set
out
in
the
rule
are
really
one
of
the
great
virtues
of
the
rule.
petitioner
in
his
brief
goes
on
at
length
trying
to
criticize
these
guidelines,
but
in
fact
this
was
an
extraordinary
effort
of
the
bar
over
many
years,
guided
in
fact
by
this
court's
decision
in
sheppard
against
maxwell,
not
only
to
set
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prejudice
standard
but
to
do
so
in
a
way
that
lawyers
will
really
understand
what
is
permitted
and
what
is
not
permitted.
and
indeed,
i
would
refer
this
court
to
page
28
of
our
brief,
footnote
28,
where
we
quote
at
length
this
court's
sheppard
v.
maxwell
decision.
and
the
court
will
see
that
many
of
the
guidelines
set
out
in
part
2
of
the
rule
were
taken
almost
verbatim
from
sheppard.
by
the
same
token,
the
third
part
of
the
rule
is
designed
to
provide
a
safe
harbor
to
let
a
lawyer
know
that
in
certain
circumstances
he
doesn't
have
to
fear
any
possibility
of
discipline
so
long
as
he
doesn't
go
outside
of
those...
of
those
parameters.
now
let
me
return
to
the
implications
of
the
standard
that's
urged
by
petitioner.
it's
interesting.
as
the
argument
is
made
in
his
brief,
it's
a
clear
and
present
danger
press
standard.
but
as
the
argument
has
been
made
today,
in
response
to
virtually
every
difficult
hypothetical
that
this
court
could...
could
propose
such
as
judges,
such
as
court
employees,
mr.
tigar
ran
from
that
standard.
and
we
would
submit
as
we
said
in
our
brief
that
if
the
clear
and
present
danger
nebraska
press
standard
were
held
to
apply
to
lawyers,
you
would
ultimately
have
precisely
what
was
indicated
by
that
questioning
and
the
answer.
you'd
have
the
dissolution
of
the
nebraska
press
standard,
because
court
would
not
want
to
hold
officers
of
the
court
to
the
same
standards
that
apply
to
the
press.
the
nebraska
press
standard,
we
submit,
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
press.
it
is
necessary
for
a
free
and
vigorous
press.
but
the
standard,
we
would
submit,
has
no
application
whatsoever
in
the
context
of
lawyers.
just
to
give
a
few
examples
to
further
the
examples
that...
that
mr.
tigar
has
given,
under
the
clear
and
present
danger
standard
presumably,
a
defense
lawyer
could
go
out,
call
a
press
conference,
and
announce
that
he
believes
his
client
is
guilty.
as
long
as
it's
done
before
trial,
he
could
do
that
and
he
could
not
be
disciplined,
cause
all
you'd
need
to
do
is
conduct
searching
voir
dire,
have
a
change
of
venue
or
one
of
the
other
devices.
now,
no
one
would
reasonably
submit
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
a
lawyer
in
a
situation
like
that
to
go
out
and
announce
to
the
press
that
his
client
is
guilty.
the
same
thing
applies--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
limitation
takes
you
back
into...
into
subsection
1.
what...
again,
what...
what
i
said
with
the
bar's--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no.
it
covers...
it
covers
civil--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--it's
a
statement
referred
to
in
subsection
1
ordinarily
is
likely
to
have
such
an
effect
when
it
refers
to
a
civil
matter
triable
to
a
jury,
a
criminal
matter,
or
other...
any
other
proceeding
that
couldn't
be
dealt
an
incarceration.
so--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
concede--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we...
we
concede
in
our
brief
that
it
would
be
extraordinarily
difficult
to
violate
the
rule
in
the
context
of
a
bench
trial,
because
of
all
the
jurisprudence
suggesting
that
judges
are
thick
skinned
and
that
they're
different.
it's
not
inconceivable
however,
and
that's
why
there
is
that
rule
to
deal
with
extraordinary
situations.
cox
v.
louisiana...
the
court
did
in
the
context
of
that
case
recognize
that
even
judges
could
in
some
circumstances
be
prejudiced.
but
the
rule
and
the
presumption...
the
guidelines
in
part
2
are
a
reflection
of
that
very
common
sense
premise
that
ordinarily
you
would
not
be
able
to
have
that
kind
of
prejudiced--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
heard
that
mr.
tigar's
rule
does
not
apply.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
our
rule
is
that
it
very
well
could.
that
there
could
be--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--because--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--studies
have
shown
that
in
sequestration
situations
juries
aren't
always
safe
from
hearing
that
sometimes
they
do
get
news.
but
sometimes--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
would
be
one
theory.
and
justice
souter
has
talked
about
the
whole
dignity
of
the
court
process.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
that
would
be...
that
would
be
one...
that
would
be
one
aspect
of
it.
the
court
in
levine...
the
case--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
dignity--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
doesn't
say
the
trial.
actually
the
way
that
the
rule
is
worded,
it's...
it
actually
is
broader
so
that
it
doesn't
cover
just
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing
a
proceeding...
of
prejudicing
the
dignity
of
the
proceeding.
it
doesn't
say
prejudice
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
and
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
levine
case...
with
the
case
mr.
tigar
cited
as
adopting
a
nebraska
press
standard...
gagged
the
lawyers
in
the
richard
miller's
case
precisely
because
of
that
reason.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
rule
is,
as
applied
in
nevada
and
as
far
as
we
know
in
all
other
jurisdictions,
only
applies
to
the
lawyer
involved
in
the
case.
and
the
reason
we
say
that,
number
1,
that's
the
reference
in
part
three
of
the
rule.
number
2,
the
disciplinary
rule
that
preceded
it
which
was
more
restrictive
of
lawyers'
speech
than
this
rule...
the
disciplinary
rule,
on
its
face,
was
clearly
limited
to
lawyers
involved
in
a
proceeding.
it
would
be
very
difficult,
for
example,
to
have
this
rule
apply
to
commentary
by
arthur
miller
appearing
on
good
morning
america.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
and
the...
and
the
nevada
bar
and
the
nevada
supreme
court
are
not
trying
to
do
that.
they're
trying
to
get
at
the
lawyer
whose
an
officer
of
the
court
in
a
pending
proceeding.
and
that's
what--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
does
not.
and
that
in
fact
gets
me
back
to
a
point--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
would
have
to
be
a
substantial
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes.
i
must
say,
however--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
facts.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
it
would
have
to
be
in
a
very
extreme
situation.
i
know
of
only
one
case
that
has
gone
off
on
that
ground,
and
that's
the
levine
case
in
the
context
of
the
gag
order.
it
was
a
situation
where
the
lawyers
were
just...
every
day
after
court...
just
bombarding
the
press
with
observations
about
the
case,
with
harsh
criticisms
about
the
prosecutors,
about
the
government's
witnesses,
very
extreme
statements--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
only
on...
you're
referring
to
the
dignity
of
the
court.
i'm
saying
that
the
dignity
of
the
court--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
primary
interest
of
the
bar
here,
and
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
is
affecting,
number
1,
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
and
number
2,
prejudicing
the
jury
venire
and
requiring
sequestration.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
not
at
all.
the
second
part
of
this
standard,
and
this
is
very
important,
is
materially
different,
because
under
mr.
tigar's
standard
of
nebraska
press,
as
long
as
you
can
get
12
jurors
who
can
decide
the
case,
then
there's
no
clear
and
present
danger.
so
that
means
through
a
change
of
venue
or
whatever.
under
our
standard,
the
very
need
to
sequester
a
jury
or
the
very
need
for
lengthy
voir
dire,
the
very
need
for
a
change
of
venue
is
itself
material
prejudiced
to
an
adjudicative
proceeding.
so
in
other
words,
the
very
need
to
rely
on
one
of
the
nebraska
press
less
restrictive
alternatives,
we
would
submit,
is
a
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudiced
to
an
adjudicative
proceeding.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--yes,
it's
very
important
to
look
at
the...
the
actual--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--it
could
in
some
cases.
but
the
primary
evil
is,
number
1--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
wording
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--but
the
wording
of
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudice
to
an
adjudicative
proceeding
rather
that
substantial
likelihood
of
prejudice
to
the
outcome
is,
for
example,
the
type
of
language
that
the
court
uses
in
its
brady
v.
maryland
test
about
whether
or
not
there's
been
reversible
error
from
a
prosecutor's
failure
to
disclose
exculpatory
evidence.
all
one
needs
to
do
is
read
the
adjoining
rules
to
the
nevada
rule
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
prejudiced
to
the
outcome
is
not
the
only
kind
of
prejudice
that
the
rule
is
dealing
with.
rule
174.1,
for
example,
prohibits
lawyers
from
seeking
to
influence
a
prospective
juror.
now,
under
mr.
tigar's
standard
that
would
not
qualify
under
the
nebraska
press
because
if
he
talked
to
that
prospective
juror,
all
you'd
have
to
do
is
find
that
out
from
voir
dire,
all
you
have
to
do
is
continue
the
trial,
all
you
have
to
do
is
have
a
change
of
venue,
and
there's
no
actual
prejudice
to
the
outcome.
and
so
there
really
is
an
important
difference.
rule
176.4
prohibits
a
lawyer
or
his
employee
as
part
of
the
trial
from
investigating
prospective
jurors
by
means
calculated
or
likely
to
lead
to
communications
with
prospective
jurors.
again,
prejudiced
to
the
proceeding,
but
under
no
nebraska
case
that
i
know
of--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--jurors
in
the
case,
but
prospective
jurors--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
if
he's
saying
that,
i
would
submit,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--he's
deluding
the
nebraska
press
standard,
and
that's
ultimately
the
fear
that
we're
concerned
about.
the
nebraska
press--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
you're...
you're
assuming
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
are
talking
about
precisely
the
same
thing
which--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--they
did
not.
in
fact
this
is
an
important
point.
what
mr.
tigar
is
complaining
that
the
police
were
talking
about
primarily
or
the
lie
detector
results
of
the
police
officers.
what
mr.
gentile
was
talking
about
was
something
totally
different.
for
example,
the
credibility
of
the
other
victims,
the
other
people
who
had
had
items
stolen
from
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--this
particular
voir
dire...
and
we
would
concede
there
were...
there
were
i
believe
10
juror
who
had
heard
about
the
case.
there
were
three
who...
who
were
aware
that
the
police
at
one
time--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--in
this
voir
dire,
it
was
not.
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
nevada
supreme
court's
finding
of
no
actual
prejudice.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
but
the
rule
is
a
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudice.
and
again,
you
have
to
look
at
it--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
his
very
admission
that
he
was
trying
to
counteract
is
not
an
exception.
i
don't
know
where
he
gets
that
from
as
an
exception
to
the
rule.
it
is
not
an
exception
because
you
believe
one
side
has
violated
the
rule
that
you're
allowed
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
was
the
danger--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
not
a
response
here.
for
example,
jurors
may
have...
may
have
seen
or
recalled
the
particular
press
conference.
and
in
fact,
i
should
note
for
the
court
that
the
press
conference
was
alluded
to
as
early
as
1
month
before
the
trial,
on
july
6th,
1988.
this
is
in
the
record,
exhibit
a,
to
the
disciplinary
hearing,
the
las
vegas
review
journal.
the
substance,
if
not
the
actual
contents
of
the
press
conference,
was
referred
to
as
much
as
a
month
before
trial.
now,
i
could
imagine
a
voir
dire
going
along
these
lines,
which
would
be
prejudice.
do
any
of
you
recognize
mr.
gentile?
yes,
i
do.
how
do
you
recognize
him?
and
then
going
into
a
lengthy
discussion
with
individual
jurors
about
what
they
remember
about
his
press
conference.
so,
yes,
there
could
be
prejudice...
new
prejudice
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
prosecutor
had
said
before.
but--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
they...
if
that's
all
they
said,
that
would...
that
would
clearly
be--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the...
number
1,
i...
we
don't
think
that
just
that
kind
of
a
conclusory
statement
would
have
the
same
prejudicial
effect.
number
3...
number
2,
the
rule
says
notwithstanding
subsection
1,
so
they
recognize
that
there
could
be
prejudice.
the
rule
provides
a
safe
harbor.
and
so
there...
there
may
be
situations
that
fall
within
category
3
in
which
in
a
particular
case
there
could
be
prejudice.
but
the
court
made
a
balancing
determination...
for
example,
items
in
the
public
record...
made
a
balancing
determination
guided
by
the
first
amendment
that
certain
types
of
speech
should
be
given
approval
and
should
be
allowed.
let
me
say
in
closing
that
in
1966
this
court
in
sheppard
against
maxwell
went
to
great
lengths
to
get
the
bar
in
the
process
of
coming
to
where
we
are
today
to
adopt
rules.
at
the
time
of
sheppard
against
maxwell,
you
had
canon
20
in
a
number
of
states
but
it
had
really
no
teeth
to
it
in
substance.
this
court
told
the
bars
that
told
the
states
to
get
serious.
the
rule
in
effect
here
is
now
in
effect.
either
this
rule
or
a
rule
more
restrictive
of
speech
is
in
effect
in
well
over
40
states
as
we've
detailed
in
our
brief
responsive
to
the
concerns
that
this
court
has
raised.
these
rules
have
worked
well.
they've
been
in
place
for
close
to
two
decades
throughout
the
country.
there
has
not
been
serious
problem
with
administering
these
rules.
that's
why
it's
taken
two
decades
before
a
case
has
reached
this
court
governing
those
rules.
and
we
urge
the
court
not
to
turn
back
the
clock.
not
to
go
back
to
the
time
of
sheppard
against
maxwell,
and
not
to
once
again
have
a
situation
where
lawyers
are
free
to
try
their
case
in
the
press.
thank
you.
