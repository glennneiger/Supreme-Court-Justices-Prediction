justice
kennedy
in...
in
your
view,
mr.
tigar,
if
the
court
makes
a
ruling
on
a
motion
in
limine
that
it's
not
to
be
brought
out
that
a
lie
detector
test
has
been
given...
trial
is
ongoing,
can
an
attorney
go
out
in
the
corridor
at
recess
time
and
tell
the
press
that
there
was
lie
detector
test
that
the
witness
had
failed?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
jury
had
been
sequestered.
justice
kennedy
clear
and
present
danger
of
what?
justice
kennedy
because
the
jury
is
going
to
find
out
about
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
the...
is
the
only
clear
and
present
danger
that
you
can
envisage
the
fact
that
the
jury
will
receive
information
that
it
ought
not
to
have?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
are
the
other
dangers
of
the
trial
process
if
an
attorney
reveals
the
contents
of
matters
that
the
judge
in
limine
has
instructed
the
attorney
shall
not
mention
in
the
courtroom?
justice
kennedy
so
rights
of
third
parties
tested
under
the
clear
and
present
danger
test?
justice
kennedy
well,
if...
if
you
say
that
the
court
can
protect
the
rights
of
third
parties
by
disciplining
or
ordering
an
attorney
not
to
discuss
certain
matters,
then
i
take
it
the
attorney
does
have
some
special
obligations
to
the
court
that
others
do
not.
is
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
why
would
it
be
undignified?
justice
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
it
would
be
undignified?
justice
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
it
would
be
undignified?
justice
kennedy
depending
upon...
upon
the
skill
of
the
counsel
making
the
presentation?
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
i
have...
one
more
question.
suppose
a
court
attache
tells
the
reporter
the
conduct...
of
the
contents
of
a
motion
in
limine
ruling,
and
the
jury
has
been
sequestered.
and
there
is
no
danger
that
the
jury
will
hear
it.
could
the
court
attache
be
disciplined?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
why?
does
it
affect
the
performance
of
the
court?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
it's
not
a
confidence.
suppose
the
court
attache
tells
the
press,
you
know,
this
police
officer
that
testified
here
this
morning,
testified
just
the
opposite
in
a
case
3
weeks
ago.
could
the
court
discipline
that
court
attache?
justice
kennedy
mr.
tigar,
if
we
adopt
the
position
you
wish
us
to
adopt,
my
assumption
is
that
in
every
bench
trial
in
the
country
an
attorney
would
be
free
to
rehearse
his
case...
discuss
his
case
on
the
courthouse
steps
1
hour
before
the
trial
begins.
am
i
not
correct?
justice
kennedy
i...
i
can't
see
any
interest
that
you've
identified
or
conceded
here
that
would
prohibit
the
bar
from
making...
that
would
permit
the
bar
to
make
a
rule
that
would
stop
that
conduct.
justice
kennedy
all
right,
then
100
yards
away
from
the
courthouse.
justice
kennedy
well,
could
sanders
have
hired
a
public
relations
person
who
is
not
a
lawyer
to
make
all
these
statements?
justice
kennedy
could...
could
this...
could
the
state
prohibit
that
conduct?
justice
kennedy
well,
on
the
question
of
the
dignity
of
the
court,
suppose
the
defense
counsel
or
trial
counsel
proves
it
to
the
jury,
to
its
satisfaction,
everything
that
he's
said
in
the
press
conference.
doesn't
that
vindicate
the
dignity
of
the
court?
justice
kennedy
because
this
is
very
important...
i...
i
assume
you...
you
would
suggest
that
it's
constitutional
to
have
a
rule
saying
that
an
officer
of
the
court,
an
attorney
in
pending
litigation
cannot
say
anything
which
prejudices
the
dignity
of
the
court.
justice
kennedy
well,
substantial
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing
the
dignity
of
the
court.
justice
kennedy
and...
and
would
you...
and
would
you
conclude
that
any
statement
that
reveals
the
testimony
that's
going
to
be
brought
forth
in
the
court
offends
the
dignity
of
the
court?
justice
kennedy
well,
what...
what
are
the
instances
which
you
are
trying
to
prohibit?
give
me
some
examples
of
what
would
be
prohibited
by
the
dignity
of
the
court
rule?
justice
kennedy
so,
only
in
very
extreme
cases
is
it
appropriate
for
a
bar
association
to
tell
the
attorney
that
it
cannot
comment
on
the
case
of
the
evidence?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
want
to
know
what
your
rule
is.
we've
talked
about
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
i...
which
i
thought
was
an
extremely
broad
standard.
but
then
you
said,
well,
but
only
in
extreme
cases
would
the
dignity
of
the
court
ever
be
affronted
by...
by
comments
made
outside
of
the
court.
and
i
said,
well,
what
other
instances
are
there
in
which
the
bar
would
have
an
interest
in
promulgating
a
rule
of
this
nature?
justice
kennedy
but
that
sounds
just
like
mr.
tigar's
clear
and
present
danger
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
background
of
this
case
is
a
rather
sensational
criminal
trial
that
took
place
in
the
state
courts
in
las
vegas
nevada.
the
defendant
was
the
owner
of
a
bank
vault
company
and
he
was
tried
for
the
theft
of
some
$260,000
that
was
missing
from
the
bank
vault.
apparently,
the
money
had
been
used
in
a
drug
sting
operation.
we
are
not
reviewing
the
criminal
case
but
in
state
bar
disciplinary
proceedings
that
arouse
out
of
it
because
the
attorney
for
the
client,
the
owner
of
the
bank
vault
company,
was
disciplined.
the
petitioner
in
the
case
is
dominic
gentile,
and
attorney
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
nevada
who
practices
in
las
vegas.
gentiles
plan
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
on
the
state
criminal
charges.
the
indictment
followed
a
year-long
investigation
which
had
received
considerable
press
coverage.
they
were
allegations
that
the
police
themselves
were
implicated
in
the
wrong
doing,
but
the
publicity
just
before
the
indictment
focused
on
gentiles
client.
it
was
gentiles
position
that
the
adverse
publicity
created
by
some
17
newspaper
stories
and
the
numerous
additional
televisions
news
stories
justified
gentile
in
calling
a
press
conference.
as
soon
as
the
indictment
came
down,
the
day
the
indictment
came
down,
he
made
a
prepared
statement
to
the
press
at
his
office.
he
outlined
his
defense
and
indicated
that
a
police
official
was
the
most
likely
suspect
in
the
case.
he
answered
some
questions
after
his
prepared
statement
and
then
declined
to
answer
others.
some
six
months
elapsed
between
the
press
conference
and
the
date
of
the
jury
trial
on
the
criminal
charges.
the
jury
acquitted
gentiles
plans
on
all
accounts.
after
the
acquittal,
the
nevada
state
bar
brought
disciplinary
charges
against
gentile
for
having
made
statements
at
the
press
conference
in
violation
of
rules
which
governs
the
bars
of
the
state
of
nevada.
the
disciplinary
board
imposed
a
private
reprimand
and
the
nevada
state
supreme
court
affirmed
the
disciplinary
order.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
nevada
supreme
court.
we
are
issuing
two
opinions
for
the
court.
one
is
signed
by
me
and
one
by
the
chief
justice.
i
deliver
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
which
we
reverse
the
judgment.
this
ruling
rest
on
the
grounds
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
rule
177
is
void
for
vagueness.
the
disciplinary
rule
contains
a
safe
harbor
provision,
rule
177
subsection
three.
it
provides
that
not
withstanding
the
other
sections
of
the
rule,
a
lawyer
may
state
without
elaboration
the
general
nature
of
the
defense.
this
safe
harbor
provision
misled
gentile
into
thinking
he
could
give
his
press
conference
without
fear
of
discipline.
absent
to
any
clarifying
interpretation
by
the
state
court,
the
rule
fails
to
provide
fair
notice
to
those
to
whom
it
is
directed
and
is
so
imprecise
that
discriminatory
enforcement
is
a
real
possibility.
a
review
of
gentiles
press
conference,
where
he
made
only
a
brief
opening
statement
and
decline
to
answer
reporters
questions
seeking
detailed
comments,
supports
his
claim
that
he
thought
his
statements
were
protected.
as
interpreted,
rule
177
creates
a
trap
for
the
weary
as
well
as
the
unweary,
and
we
reverse.
chief
justice
also
delivers
an
opinion
for
the
court.
in
this
opinion,
it
is
concluded
that
the
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudice
test
applied
by
nevada
and
most
other
states
satisfies
the
first
amendment.
the
court,
in
this
opinion,
concludes
that
speech
of
lawyers
representing
clients
in
pending
cases
may
be
regulated
under
a
less
demanding
standard
than
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
established
for
regulation
of
the
press
during
pending
proceedings.
under
the
opinion
for
the
court
by
the
chief
justice,
the
substantial
likelihood
of
material
prejudice
standard
is
a
constitutionally
permissible
balance
between
the
rights
of
attorneys
in
pending
cases
and
the
states
interest
in
fair
trials.
the
standard
is
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
and
fairness
of
a
state?s
judicial
system
and
imposes
only
narrow
and
necessary
limitations
on
lawyers
speech.
justices
marshall,
blackmun,
and
stevens
join
all
of
my
opinion
and
justice
o'connor
joins
it
in
part.
justices
white,
scalia,
and
souter
join
all
of
the
chief
justices
opinion,
and
justice
o'connor
joins
it
in
part.
the
chief
justices
opinion
also
is
in
part
a
dissent.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
