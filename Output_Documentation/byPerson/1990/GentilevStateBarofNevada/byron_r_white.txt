justice
white
and
so
you...
i
take
it,
mr.
tigar,
then
you...
you
think
that
any
lawyer
can
deliberately
speak
out
before
a
trial
begins
and
say
things
that
he
knows
and
intends
to
create
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prejudicing
a
fair
trial.
justice
white
lawyers
are
just
free
to
do
that.
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
attempt
to
subvert
the...
the
trial
process.
is
that
what
your
position--
justice
white
--well,
the--
justice
white
--the
rule...
you
say
the
rule...
this
rule,
paragraph
one
is
unconstitutional
in
the
states.
justice
white
because
it
doesn't
include
the
clear
and
present
danger
standard.
that's
what
i
understood.
justice
white
so
a
lawyer
is
free
to
make
statements
that
he
knows
will
have
a
substantial
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing
an
adjudicative
proceeding.
now,
he's
just
free
to
do
that?
justice
white
well...
well,
what
can
you
do
to
him?
i
thought
you
said
the
first
amendment
protects
him.
justice
white
well,
you're
not
answering
my
question.
you're
not
answering
my
question
at
all.
is
a
lawyer
protected
by
the
first
amendment
from...
protected
by
the
first
amendment
if
he
deliberately
makes
statements
that
he
knows
will
have
a
substantial
likelihood
of
materially
prejudicing...
and
i
thought
you
said
he...
that
first
amendment
protects
him.
justice
white
well,
so
i
would
say
he
is
free...
that
any
lawyer
is
free
to
try
to
prejudice
an
adjudicative
proceeding.
justice
white
the
first
amendment
gives
him
that
right.
justice
white
so
i
guess
it's
just
how
hard
he's
going
to
try
to
prejudice
it.
justice
white
well,
if
he
tries
real
hard,
he
can
probably
create
a
clear
and
present
danger.
justice
white
but
if
he
just
goes
out
and
says,
well,
i
really
want
to...
i
really
want
to
prejudice
this,
but
i'll
only
create
a
substantial
likelihood
of
it.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--i
think...
i
think
this
rule
is
aimed
at
cynical
lawyers.
justice
white
not
lawyers
who
know
that
they
are...
that
likely
are
going
to
prejudice
the
proceeding.
justice
white
what
did
the
supreme
court
hold?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
no
actual
prejudice
but
as
it
turns
out,
the
lawyer
wasn't
successful
in
prejudicing
the
proceedings.
justice
white
well,
you've
never...
had
to
deal
with
a
press
release
and
a
labor
lawyer.
i
mean
a
labor
leader.
none
of
these
cases
you've
been
talking
about
dealt
with
lawyers.
justice
white
he
wasn't
a
lawyer.
justice
white
he
wasn't
a
lawyer
and
what
they
did
was
try
to...
they
wanted
to
hold
the...
the
press
and
the
labor
leader
in
contempt.
and
there
were
no
lawyers
involved
in
that
case.
justice
white
and
landmark
that
you
rely
on
carefully
said
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
participant
in
the
trial.
justice
white
that
day
or
the
day
before?
justice
white
you
would
like
to
have
the
court
find
protected.
