mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
truthful
statement
to
the
media
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
more
than
6
months
before
a
scheduled
trial.
for
nearly
a
year
before
that
statement,
las
vegas
media
portrayed
dominic
gentile's
client,
grady
sanders,
as
a
suspect.
they
said
sanders
was
a
key
target.
the
police
fed
these
stories.
the
police
said
that
their
officers
had
passed
drug
and
polygraph
tests.
at
joint
appendix
pages
43
through
45,
mr.
gentile
tells
us
what
he
did.
he
kept
silent
until
there
was
an
indictment.
he
kept
silent
until,
at
the
first
court
appearance,
a
trial
date
was
set
that
he
then
knew
would
be
more
than
6
months
in
the
future.
the
night
before
arraignment
he
went
to
the
library
and
researched
the
law
on
what
he
could
and
could
not
say.
exhibit
d
in
the
hearing
shows
what
he
read,
including,
by
the
way,
what
was
at
that
time
the
american
bar
association's
inconsistent
position,
on
the
one
hand
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
and
on
one
hand
the
tendency
test.
in
his
presentation
which
is
video
taped
and
available
to
the
court
and
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
he
stressed
on
at
least
five
separate
occasions
that
he
was
discussing
what
the
evidence
would
show.
he
made
no
further
press
conference
thereafter
until--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--yes,
the
conference,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
videotaped.
he
thereafter
remained
silent
until
after
the
trial.
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
the
trial
judge
raised
a
complaint
or
sought
a
protective
order.
and
at
trial
some
70
pages
of
voir
dire
transcript
show
that
not
one
juror
remembered
the
press
statement.
mr.
gentile
proved
at
trial
what
he
said
that
he
would,
and
grady
sanders
was
acquitted.
the
bar's
charges
against
him--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--it
could
be.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
burden
rests
on
the
state,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
particular
trial,
the
cross
examination
of
government
witnesses
is...
which
of
course
defense
counsel
almost
always
does...
always
does
in
my
experience...
brought
out
the
vital
admission
that
these
police
officers
were
doing
exactly
what
mr.
gentile
said
they
were.
they
were
using
narcotics.
so
it
came
out
in
that
way
in
that
case
in
addition
to
the
defense
evidence.
but
it
is
important
to
stress
that
mr.
gentile
did
not
say
anything
at
that
conference
which
under
any
view
of
the
trial
would
not
be
admissible
in
evidence,
because
what
he
was
focusing
on
were
the
charges
against
his
client
and
the
fundamental
defects
in
the
government's
proof.
now,
at
the
hearing
in
this
case
based
on
these
charges,
they
singled
out
six
separate
parts
of
the
conference.
the
bar
counsel
essentially
introduced
the
statement
and
then
rested.
the
nevada
supreme
court
affirming
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
evidence
demonstrated
that
there
was
no
actual
prejudice
in
this
case.
"
we
are
here,
if
the
court
please,
because
the
respondent
has
conjured
for
the
court
a
collision
between
the
first
and
the
sixth
amendments.
a
collision
that
this
court
has
expressly
on
two
occasions
and
consistently
wisely
refused
to
find,
saying
in
the
nebraska
press
case
that
the
framers
intended
no
hierarchy
between
first
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
and
saying,
in
bridges
v.
california
where
this
line
of
authority
begins,
that
the
court
will
not
make
a
forced
choice
between
the
first
and
the
sixth
amendments.
the
respondents
conjure
this
collision
by
inviting
the
court,
we
suggest,
to
ignore
the
working
principles
to
which
this
court
referred
at
page
845
of
its
opinion
in
landmark.
the
principles
founded,
as
the
court
made
clear
at
page
843
of
that
opinion,
rest
upon
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
but
did
not
require
a
mechanical
application
of
it.
now
we
want
to
look
at
these
working
principles,
because
they
are
a
touchstone.
we
submit
that
two
ideas
emerge.
the
first
is
the
formulation
of
a
rule.
we
submit
that
before
trials,
lawyers
and
judges
can
in
good
faith
sit
down
and
fashion
orders...
not
based
upon
imaginings,
not
at
wholesale,
but
in
light
of
concrete
circumstances...
orders
that
will
restrain
speech
likely
to
have
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
trial
process.
in
analogous--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--that's
my
understanding,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
justice
o'connor,
we
do.
we
take
that
position
because
we
agree
with
the
american
bar
association,
which
doesn't
support
the
outcome
here
but
supports
the
rule,
that
it
doesn't
embody
the
clear
and
present
danger
standard.
and
to
that
extent
we
say
that
violates
what
the
court
said
in
landmark.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
typical
of
what
many
states
have
done.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
any
rule
that
does
not
embody
the
clear
and
present
danger
standard
would
be
invalid
under
our
view,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
this
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
the
court
has
had
to
say
to
the
bar
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
stop
short
of
its
door.
again,
however,
the
problem,
justice
o'connor,
is
not
simply
a
facial
invalidity.
it
is
not
simply
overbreadth
but
vagueness.
as
the
materials
that
mr.
gentile
consulted
the
night
before
that
are
in
that
exhibit
d
point
out,
there
is
judicial
disagreement.
there
is
disagreement
among
even
the
aba
standards.
how
do
you
know
what
to
do?
the
invalidity
also
appears,
justice
o'connor,
from
a
reading
of
subparagraphs
two
and
three,
which
in
an
attempt
to
clarify
matters
only
add
to
the
difficulties.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
our
position
on
that
is
clear.
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
court
will
adopt
for
this
kind
of
a
case
what
it
said
in
landmark
that
it's
not
beyond
the
wit
of
bar
association
folks
to
sit
down
and
draft
a
rule
that
would
meet
that
standard.
but
we
do
find
a
problem
with
many
of
the
rules
that
exist
in
the
states
under
the
standard
that
we
think
this
court
has
set
out.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
absolutely
not,
justice
kennedy.
that's
the
kind
of
a
mid-trial
order
or
a
pretrial
order
that
takes
account
of
the
concrete
dangers
to
the
jury
process.
that's
the
sort
of
order
that
the
court--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--there
might
be
less
danger
under
such
circumstances,
but
justice
kennedy,
i
would
submit
that
there
a
court
could
well
find
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
nonetheless
exists,
because
we
all--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
harm
to
the
deliberative
process
that's
then
ongoing.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
justice
kennedy,
i've
tried
some
cases
with
sequestered
juries,
and
unfortunately,
despite
the
marshals'
best
efforts
and
sometimes
even
because
the
marshals
are
careless,
matters
are
communicated
to
the
jury.
there
is
less
risk
under--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--no,
there
are
other
dangers
to
the
trial
process,
although
once
you
get
away
from
impact
on
the
jury's
deliberations,
they
are
considerably
more
attenuated.
judges,
after
all,
are
suppose
to
have
thicker
skins
and
suppose
to
be
able
to
deal
with
the--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
court's
opinion
in
alderman
against
united
states
referred
to
two
of
them;
national
security
and
the
rights
of
third
parties,
suggesting
that
protective
orders
were
necessary
there.
the
court
in
seattle
times
v.
rhinehart
referred
to
protective
orders
in
the
civil
discovery
process
which
often
implicates
the
privacy
rights
of
strangers
to
the
litigation
in
a
way
that
oughtn't
to
be
compromised
for
the
sake
of
the
private
interest
of
litigants.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
not,
justice
kennedy,
because
at
least
to
the
extent
that
they
do
not
involve
core
speech
on
matters
of
public
concern.
the
case
before
the
court
presents
such
core
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
the
court
has
not
suggested
either
in
alderman,
certainly
which
is
a
routine
run-of-the-mind
protective
order,
or
in
seattle
times
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
is
appropriate.
and
we
certainly
would
say
that
the
court
need
not
adopt
it
in
order
to
reach
the
result
that
we
contend
for
with
respect
to
the
speech
in
issue.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the
attorney
has
a
special
obligation...
an
obligation
to
respect
client
confidences
and
an
obligation
of
candor
to
the
tribunal,
among
others.
but
this
court
has
always
said
that
that
special
obligation
does
not
include
the
forfeiture
at
wholesale
of
the
rights
of
the
attorney
as
public
citizen.
it
said
that,
i
think,
in
keller
against
state
bar.
it
said
that
in
the
advertising
cases
and
in
the
solicitation
cases
of
primus
and
railway
trainmen.
more
significantly,
justice--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--mr.
justice
scalia,
if
the
reenactment
has
no
risk
of
any
danger
to
the
engoing
trial
process--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
there
is
no--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
your...
if
there
is
no
risk
of
danger
to
the
trial
process,
that
sort
of
behavior,
undignified
as
it
may
be...
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
lawyers
have
done
something
undignified...
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
justice
scalia's
question
assumed
that
it
would
be
undignified.
as
i
understood
the
question--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--pardon
me?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
would
not
necessarily
be
undignified,
justice
kennedy.
i
think--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
have
never
done
a
preenactment
of
a
celebrated
case.
i've
been
involved
in
post-case
reenactments,
and
my
dignity
has
to
be
judged
by
others.
i
have
a
conflict
of
interest
to
argue
it
here.
but
i
think--
[laughter]
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
connick
v.
meyers,
justice
kennedy...
the
court
attache
can
be
disciplined.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
different
standards,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
rule
which
has
to
do
with
lawyer
confidences,
court
attache
duties,
and
the
duties
generally
of
employees
as
exemplified
in
nonlawyer
cases
such
as
carpenter
and
snepp
have
to
do
with
the
employer's
responsibility
and
ability
of
consistent--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
absent
an
employment
relationship
that
governs
the
speech,
such
as
in
connick
or
snepp,
then
that
information
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
would
be
subject
to
the
same
standard
for
which
we
argue
here.
however,
it's
difficult
in
my
experience
to
get
the
court
attache
out
from
under
the
connick
v.
meyers
employee
resolution.
what
i
wanted
to
do--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--yes,
justice
souter--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
had
a
little
more
to
my
answer,
justice
souter--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--because
i
take
your
question
extremely
seriously.
judges,
because
of
their
special
position,
must
know
that
their
utterances
pose
special
risks
of
danger
to
the
deliberative
process.
moreover,
a
judge...
and
therefore,
the...
the
danger
standard
may
be
the
same,
but
in
practical
application
it's
different.
moreover,
a
judge--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--no,
it
is
extremely
significant,
justice
souter,
and
there
is
an
additional
reason.
when
a
judge
speaks
out,
the
judge
may
very
well
trigger
a
motion
to
recuse
the
judge
or
his
or
her
colleagues
for
bias.
but
to
come
back
to
the
issue
which
i
think
is
embodied
in
your
question
and
justice
kennedy's,
lawyers
have
a
special
status.
of
course
they
do;
but
it
is
a
special
status
that
cuts
it
seems
to
me
in
petitioner's
favor
here.
because
lawyers
have
always
been
not
only
representatives
of
private
litigants
and
their
interests,
but
also
when
they've
been
doing
their
professional
job,
people
who
have
spoken
out
about
matters
of
public
concern.
i
find
that
when
john
adams
sat
down
on
july
3rd,
1776,
and
wrote
home
to
his
wife
about
what
was
happening
in
philadelphia,
when
he
talked
about
what
he
and
james
otis
had
done
in
1761
in
boston,
evoking
it
seems
to
me
not
only
the
arguments
that
they
made
in
court
in
sewell
v.
hancock
and
the
other
writ
of
assistance
cases,
but
also
the
public
debate
in
the
massachusetts
file.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
as
the
court
did
in
landmark,
by
looking
not
at
legislative-type
findings
such
as
embodied
in
rule
177
and
like
the
nevada
supreme
court
entertained.
but
by
looking
at
real
evidence
of
real
prospects
to
harm.
the
clear
and
present--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
souter,
the
court
has
resolutely
refused
to
find
the
collision
of
first
and
sixth
amendment
rights
the
question
suggests.
and
in
this
case
there
are
70
pages
of
voir
dire
which
i
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
read.
there
the
jurors
said
what
jurors
always
do;
they
may
have
heard
something
in
the
media
they
don't
remember
and
it
won't
influence
them.
they
were
interrogated
in
great
detail
about
that.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
would
answer
your
question
then,
sir,
in
this
way,
and
i'm
sorry
if
you
thought
i
had
evaded
it
earlier.
the
public's
business
is
done
in
more
than
one
forum
at
a
time.
granted
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
and
voir
dire...
the
elapse
of
time
and
these
other
things...
are
there
to
preserve
the
trial
process.
but
if
the
las
vegas
police,
as
the
jury
implicitly
found
in
this
case
because
it
was
argued
to
them,
are
taking
cocaine
from
an
investigation
and
traveler's
checks
and
sniffing
it
and
distributing
it
and
stealing
the
money,
that
is
a
matter
of
the
public's
concern
in
the
immediate
future.
the
fact
that
the
public's
business
is
at
stake
here,
which
may
be
done
in
more
than
one
place
at
a
time,
is
a
part
of
every
case
that
does
the
public's
business.
indeed,
there
are
times
when
prosecutors
exercising
the
historic
right
of
nolle
prosequi
recognized
that
they
have
made
wrong
decisions,
particularly
prosecutors
who
rely
on
being
reelected
to
hold
their
offices.
that's
the
problem.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
am
saying,
justice
souter,
that
lawyers
are
public
citizens,
that
these
are
matters
of
public
concerns,
and
that
the
government...
if
by
that
we
mean
the
people's
right
to
govern
themselves...
is
something
we
hold
dear...
the
first
amendment
test
for
which
we
contend
is
essential
to
the
proper
operation
of
decision
making
processes
that
go
well
beyond
the
narrow
interests
of
a
particular
trial.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
i
am
understood
as
saying
that,
justice
white,
i
have
been
a
great
deal
less--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--coherent
than
i
should.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
justice
white--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
white--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--no,
justice
white,
he
is
not.
if
the
aba--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
the
aba
would
return
to
the
standards
for
criminal
justice
that
it
once
enacted
before
the
model
rules,
the...
a
rule
can
be
fashioned
which
takes
account
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
standard.
it
can
be
embodied
in
orders
of
the
kind
that
justice
kennedy
and
i
were
speaking
of.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
unless
the
state
is
willing
to
go
further,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
provided
that
the
speech--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--provided
the
speech
only
rises
to
the
substantial
likelihood
test
and
not
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
yes,
that
is
our
position.
and
the
reason
for
our
position,
justice
white,
is
that
the--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
white,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
erected--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
white,
you
assume
the
cynical
lawyer,
and
of
course,
sometimes
rules
are
made
for
cynical
people.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
on
this
record
we
see
a
lawyer--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--on
this--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
wish...
i
wish
to
start
by
noting
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
did
not
require
any
such
proof
with
respect
to
petitioner
gentile,
and
the
american
bar
association
hasn't
said
that
he
violated
the
rule
for
which
they
contend.
so
petitioner's
case
must
be
set
apart.
but
the
second--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--it
found
no
prejudice
but
said
that
none
was
necessary--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--and
cited
its
earlier
case
of
in
re
raggio.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
undisputed
evidence,
justice
white,
is
that
the
amount
of
study
and
concern
he
put
in
the
night
before
illustrates
a
determination
to
try
to
follow
the
rules.
and
i
think
the
record
shines
through
with
that.
but
coming
to
the
next
point;
the
process
of
speech
about
matters
that
are
currently
involved
in
litigation
may
very
well
mean
that
there
are
risks
to
the
process
of
fair
trial.
the
first
amendment
standard
that
the
court
has
applied
from
bridges
v.
california
on
through
landmark
and
butterworth
has
said
that
those
risks--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--bridges
was
a
participant,
justice
white,
with--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--that
is
correct.
he
was
not
a
lawyer.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
and
for
that,
sir,
we
will
have
to
rely,
mr.
justice
white,
on
the
cases
such
as
keller
v.
state
bar
and
the
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
stop
at
the
bar's
door.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
justice
white,
and
the
participants,
which
again
is
a
term
broader
than
lawyers,
would
invoke
the
bridges
and...
and
wood
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
rules--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--there
is
a
prosecutor
rule
that
says
that
prosecutors
have
to
try
to
control
the
police.
lawyers'
staffs
are
probably
covered
by
the
intent
of
the
rule,
although
the
solicitor
general
has
taken
the
position
that
those
other
than
the
lawyer
are
entirely
free
to
speak.
that
is
a
difficulty
with
the
position
that
they
have
advocated
here,
and
that
of
course
supports
the
position
that
we've
taken.
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
odd
view
the
defendant
can
hire
someone
to
speak
for
them.
so
next
case
will
be
the
court
regulating
the
ethics
of
public
relations
firms.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
we
would
not
take
that
position,
justice
kennedy.
certain...
the
courthouse
steps
of
course--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--cox
v.
louisiana...
cox,
too,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
100
yards
away
from
the
courthouse
we
still
have
conduct
brigaded
with
speech,
which
is
a
part
of
the
burden
of
cox,
too.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
100
yards
away
and
the
day
before
a
reenactment
of
a
potential
bench
trial
such
as
a
moot
court
argument
to
a
group
of
law
students
before
a
supreme
court
argument
might
very
well
be
the
sort
of
exercise
that
the
court
would
find
protected.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
the
balance--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--excuse
me,
if
i
misspoke,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
in
1981,
the
aba
drafts
group,
as
pointed
out
at
footnote
19
of
our
reply
brief,
did
say
that
the
standard
in
this
rule
is
equivalent
to
clear
and
present
danger.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
we
disagree
with
that,
but
the
court
we
think
should
know
it.
we
are
gratified
that
at
last
it's
been
identified
that
one
object
of
this
rule
is
to
protect
the
dignity
of
courts,
language
that
in
our
respectful
submission
evokes
the
seditious
libel
cases
of
the
18th
century.
and
were
there
any
doubt
about
that,
the
case
of
in
re
raggio
decided
by
the
nevada
supreme
court
and
relied
on
in
the...
affirming
here,
deals
with
a
prosecutor
who,
although
he
was
counsel
in
the
pending
case,
was
disciplined
because
he
helped
to
erode
confidence
in
our
system
of
justice.
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
danger
of
overbreadth
here.
that
was
a
press
conference
about
a
decision
of
the
nevada
supreme
court
that
followed
the
witherspoon
case.
it
is
important
we
believe
to
note
that
the
first...
the
levine
gag
order
referred
to
here
did
use
a
clear
and
present
danger
test.
that
shows
the
workability
of
this.
mr.
gentile
did
limit
himself
to
what
he
thought
could
be
proved
at
the
trial.
he
was
caught
between
the
language
of
2a,
can't
comment
on
character,
reputation,
et
cetera,
and
3a...
you
can
state
the
general
nature
of
the
claim
or
defense.
these
victim
identifies,
after
all,
were
in
the
various
counts
of
the
indictment
to
which
he
was
responding.
hard
to
know
how
he
could
get
more
specific
than
alluding
to
the
victims
as
real...
as
really
the
wrong
doers
without
falling
afoul
of
2a.
in
sum,
i
stood
at
the
bar
for
25
years,
and
i
care
about
the
bar's
professionalism.
i
think
everybody
in
this
room
does.
i
think
that
the
respondent's
position
we
submit
is
based
on
fear.
fear
that
the
contrariety
of
views
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
won't
resolve
these
problems
to
which
the
court
points.
fear
that
lawyers
and
judges
can't
draft
effective
protective
orders.
fear
that
the
wonder-working
power
of
voir
dire
and
of...
can't
do
it.
thank
you.
