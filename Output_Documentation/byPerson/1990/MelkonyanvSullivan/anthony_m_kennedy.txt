justice
kennedy
under
your
theory
of
the
statute
that
the
30-day
final
judgment
rule
is
simply
an
outside
limit,
would
a
prevailing
party
be
entitled
to
make
multiple
applications
for
fees?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
thought
you
told
the...
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
was
that
the
30
days
was
just
an
outer
limit,
and
that
you
could
make
application
for
fees
at
any
time
before
that?
justice
kennedy
and
if
you're
prevailing
as
to
part
of
the
action,
can
you
then
apply
for
fees
as
to
that
part,
and
then
come
back
and
apply
for
more
fees
when
the
final
determination
is
made
by
the
agency?
justice
kennedy
you
rely
on
sullivan
v.
hudson,
and
there
we
said
the
procedure
set
forth
in
42
u.s.c.
405(g)
contemplates
additional
action
both
by
the
secretary
and
the
district
court
before
civil
action
is
concluded
following
a
remand.
is
that
observation
just
inapplicable
to
this
case,
or
is
it
wrong?
justice
kennedy
is
this
under
405(g)
at
all?
justice
kennedy
well,
under
your
view
what
statutory
authority
did
the
court
act
under
when
it
remanded
the
case?
justice
kennedy
so
then
it's
a
little
odd
to
say
it's
a
405(g)
action.
you
say
it
was
implied?
i
supposed
it's
just
the
general
supervisory
powers
of
the
courts,
or
the
general
authority
of
the
courts?
justice
kennedy
so
then
our
observation
in
sullivan
v.
hudson
was,
at
the
least,
incomplete?
justice
kennedy
so
the
case
you
rely
on
is
incomplete?
justice
kennedy
suppose
it
were
unclear.
