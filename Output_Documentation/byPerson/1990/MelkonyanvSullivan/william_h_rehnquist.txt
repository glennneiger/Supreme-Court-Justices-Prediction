chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
90-5538,
zakhar
melkonyan
v.
louis
w.
sullivan.
mr.
wolfman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wolfman,
if
you
read
further
on
in
the
language
you're
construing,
where
it
says
a
judgment
is
final
and
not
appealable,
i
get
the
sense
congress
was
not
using
terms
of
art
here.
what
does
the
phrase
"not
appealable"
mean
about
a
judgment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
congress
meant
by
saying
not
appealable
that
the
time
for
appeal
must
have
run?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
secretary
doesn't
get
it?
does
that
then
mean
that
your
client
is
not
in
a
position
to
argue...
to
request
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
the
secretary
doesn't
get
it,
then
your
client
would
have
to
get
it
in
order
to
be
able
to
move
for
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
says
a
party
seeking
an
award
of
fees
and
other
expenses
shall
within
30
days
of
final
judgment.
now,
are
you
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
have
a
final
judgment
in
order
to
file
application
for
attorneys'
fee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the
language
"within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
action.
"
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
statute
seems
to
address
it
in
a
different
way,
at
least
it
seems
to
me.
if
it
says
you
shall
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
action
file
an
application
for
fees,
i
would
think
that
would
presuppose
that
there
is
a
final
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
read
that
language?
a
party
seeking
an
award
of
fees
shall
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
submit
to
the
court
an
application.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfman.
mr.
sloan,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
secretary's
present
position
based
at
least
in
part
on
those
two
decisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can't
you
answer
the
question
more
definitively,
mr.
sloan?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
question
calls
for
a
fairly
simple
answer,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sloan.
mr.
wolfman,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-5538,
melkonyan
against
sullivan
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
