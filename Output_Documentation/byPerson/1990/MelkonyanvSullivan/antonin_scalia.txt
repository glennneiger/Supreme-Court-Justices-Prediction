justice
scalia
mr.
wolfman,
i
think
i
agree
with
you
that
normally
that's,
that's
the
way
we
would
interpret
words
like
that,
but
we
have
already
interpreted
other
words
in
d(1)a
in
a
way
that's
a
little
unusual.
that
is
to
say,
we
have
held
that
although
you're
entitled...
it
only
says
you're
entitled
to
fees...
fees
and
other
expenses
incurred
by
that
party
in
any
civil
action.
now
i
would
normally
think
that
civil
action
meant
only
a
suit
before
a
law
court
as
well,
and
not
an
action
before
an
agency.
but
we
have
interpreted
that
to
entitle
you
to
a
fee
before
the
agency.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
give
that
phrase
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
meaning,
in
order
to
make
sense
out
of
the
whole
provision
we're
going
to
have
to
give
the
phrase
"judgment"
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
meaning
too.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
but
they
do
consider
them
part
of
the
civil
action.
justice
scalia
right.
but
that's
what
gets
us
into
the
situation
we're
in.
and
if
you're
going
to
interpret
civil
action
broadly
that
way
to
include
everything,
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
interpret
judgment
broadly
to
include
anything
at
either
level.
justice
scalia
mr.
wolfman,
you
talk
as
though
the
position
you're
arguing
applies
only
in
social
security
cases,
and
you
say
it's
the
practice
of
the
secretary
to
file
these
things
automatically.
but
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
doesn't
just
apply
to
the
social
security
act.
so
it
would
have
to
be
every
agency
of
the
government
which,
upon
remand
from
a
court,
when
the
agency
action
has
been
reversed,
every
agency
of
the
government
would
then
have
to
come
back
to
that
district
court,
i
take
it,
in
order
to
cut
off,
you
know,
years
later
seeking
fees
under
the
eaja.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
you're
talking
about
the
equivalent
in
the
social
security
context
of
a
405(g)
sentence
6
remand,
correct?
justice
scalia
which
do
you
consider
this?
is
this
a
sentence
6--
justice
scalia
--or
sentence
4?
justice
scalia
well,
you
should
have
been
making
a
different
argument
then,
because
under
a
sentence
6
remand
you
have
to
come
back
to
the
court.
justice
scalia
no
problem
there.
then
the
final
judgment
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
when
you
come
back.
the
only
problem,
i
guess,
is
when
it's
a
sentence
4
remand
under
the
social
security
act,
and
god
knows
what
under
all
the
other
statutes
to
which
the
eaja
applies.
right?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
was
the
secretary's
motion
in
this
case
to
send
it
back,
was
that
made
before
the
answer?
justice
scalia
well,
then
how
can
it
be
a
section
6
remand?
justice
scalia
i
see.
and
it
may
at
any
time
order
additional
evidence
to
be
taken
before
the
secretary.
did
the
court
order
the
additional
evidence?
justice
scalia
well,
but...
it's
the
substance...
there
are
two
parts
to
sentence
6.
the
first
part
is
the
court
may
on
motion
of
the
secretary
made
for
good
cause
shown
before
he
files
his
answer
send
it
back.
now,
the
secretary
initiated
it
here,
but
not
before
he
filed
his
answer.
right?
justice
scalia
the
second
part
is
it
may
at
any
time
order
additional
evidence
to
be
taken.
did
it
order
additional
evidence
to
be
taken?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
then
neither
the
first
part
nor
the
second
part
of
sentence
6
seems
to
apply.
justice
scalia
before
answer,
if
you
intend
to
be
under
section
6...
sentence
6.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
you
think
the
secretary
would
have
been
in
contempt
of
court
if
he
had
not
taken
additional
evidence
in
this
case,
if
he
had
just
reconsidered
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
same
evidence?
did
he
take
additional
evidence?
justice
scalia
but
you
think
he
had
to?
that
he
could
not
just
have
used
the
evidence
already
there
and
altered
his
decision,
because
impliedly
the
court
ordered
additional
evidence
to
be
taken?
justice
scalia
you
do?
you
would
be
arguing
for
this
if
hudson
had
come
out
the
other
way?
justice
scalia
mr.
sloan,
you
talk
about
the
administrative
difficulty
of
accepting
the
petitioner's
position,
but
what
about
the
administrative
difficulty
of
accepting
yours?
it
may
be
easy
enough
with
respect
to
the
social
security
administration,
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
other
agencies
that
the
thing
is
remanded
and
the
thing
sort
of
goes
on
forever.
i
mean,
a
major
proceeding,
atomic
licensing
or
an
fcc
proceeding.
i'm
not
sure
that
in
major
administrative
cases
of
that
sort
it's
as
easy
to
identify
the
moment
of
judgment,
as
it
is
in
social
security.
how
do
you
expect
us
to...
i
mean,
are
we
buying
into
a
whole
grab
bag
of
future
petitions
to
decide
when
a
judgment
occurs
in
administrative
actions?
justice
scalia
i
guess
under
petitioner's
scheme,
he's
going
to
have
to
decide
when
there
is
a
final
judgment
in
the
agency
as
well.
i
mean,
you're
going
to
have
to
know
when
to
go
back
to
the
district
court.
so
that
may
be
a
problem
under
anybody's
resolution.
justice
scalia
well,
he
could
go
back
too
late,
but
he
can't
go
back
too
early.
i
mean,
he's
going
to
have
to
figure
out
at
least
when
the
judgment
occurs
that
enables
him
to
go
back.
he
may
not
have
to
do
it
right
away,
but
he's
going
to
have
to
figure
out
when
the
judgment
occurs
before
the
agency.
justice
scalia
what
would
require,
mr.
sloan?
what
is
it
that
requires
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order?
i
mean,
you
can
ask
him
to
enter
an
order.
what
provision
of
law
requires
a
district
court
to
enter
an
order?
justice
scalia
you
have
to
persuade
some
district
court
to
enter
an
order.
justice
scalia
suppose
i'm
a
district
judge
and
i
say
i
don't
want
to
be
bothered
with
these
things.
i
had
this
case
and
i
got
rid
of
it.
justice
scalia
i
entered
judgment
and
the
case
is
gone.
stop
bothering
me.
i
don't
want
to
enter
an
order.
is
there
any
provision
of
law
that
requires
a
district
judge
to
enter
an
order?
justice
scalia
couldn't
he
deny
the
motion?
simply
say
i
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss,
because
i
have
already
dismissed.
this
was
a
section
4
remand,
not
a
section
6
remand.
the
case
has
been
dismissed.
i
deny
the
motion.
justice
scalia
would
that
be
a
new
action
when
he
came
back
or
the
same
action?
do
the
district
courts
have
to
keep
their
dockets
open
interminably
until
somebody
finally
walks
back
and
says
by
the
way,
this
case
that
you
remanded
5
years
ago,
close
the
docket
on
it?
do
they
have
to
keep
it
open--
justice
scalia
--forever
until
it's
closed?
i
would
have
assumed
it's
a
new
lawsuit
when
the
secretary
doesn't
act
properly
on
remand,
and
you
open
a
new
docket
number.
justice
scalia
i
think
it
would
be
most
unlikely
for
him
to
give
it
a
new
number
in
the
district
court
when
this
case
comes
back.
justice
scalia
how
about
under
other
statutes,
mr.
sloan?
i
mean,
this
applies
to
all
statutes.
is
there
a
general
practice
under
all
other
statutes
under
which
agencies
are
sued?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
to
your
knowledge
the
practice
is
not
to
go
back?
justice
scalia
there
are
other
statutes
that
have
the
equivalent
of
section
6
remands
in
them
that
specifically
authorize
the
court
to
remand
to
the
agency
for
the
taking
of
further
evidence,
aren't
there?
justice
scalia
and
do
you
think
an
agency
has
authority
to
do
that
even
apart
from
an
explicit
provision
in
the
statute?
in
the
middle
of
a
case
to
say,
you
know,
it
seems
to
us
the
record
is
incomplete.
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no.
the
district
court.
it's
a
case
in
the
district
court.
do
you
think...
or
the
court
of
appeals.
could
the
court
of
appeals
ever
send
it
back
for
the
taking
of--
justice
scalia
--they
do
that
sometimes,
even
without
explicit
authority,
don't
they?
justice
scalia
and
you
would
treat
that
the
same
way
you
would
treat
a
sentence
6
under
the
social
security
act?
justice
scalia
suppose
it
was
unclear--
--a
provision
of
the
statute
or
of
the
court's
order.
justice
scalia
mr.
sloan,
lest
silence
be
deemed
consent,
don't
associate
me
with
your
suggestion
that
in
a
sentence
6
case
the
secretary
can
avoid
going
back
by
simply
saying
something
to
the
district
court.
as
i
read
that,
that
sentence
6,
he
has
to
go
back
with
a
new
judgment.
justice
scalia
in
the
face
of
the
statute
which
says
that
he
has
to
come
back
with
the...
with
a
new
order.
well,
that's
another
case,
but--
