mr.
brian
wolfman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
is
called
upon
in
this
case
to
construe
the
following
language
in
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
a
law
which
provides
for
attorneys'
fees
against
the
federal
government,
and
that
language
is,
"a
party
seeking
an
award
of
fees
and
other
expenses
shall
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
action
submit
to
the
court
an
application
for
fees
and
other
expenses
which
shows
that
that
party
is
the
prevailing
party.
"
the
question
here
is
whether,
as
we
maintain
and
as
was
universally
the
law
prior
to
the
decision
below,
that
this
limitations
period
may
only
be
triggered
by
a
court
judgment,
or
whether,
as
the
respondent,
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
contends,
this
statute
can
be
triggered
by
an
administrative
decision
of
an
administrative
agency.
this
case
began
in
1982
when
petitioner
applied
for
social
security
disability
benefits
under
the
ssi
program.
he
appealed
adverse
administrative
decisions
through
the
administrative
process
and
the
case
proceeded
to
the
federal
district
court.
after
a
period
of
time,
the
case
was
remanded
before
any
proceedings
on
the
merits
or
any
decisions
on
the
merits
by
the
district
judge.
the
case
was
remanded
for
the
taking
of
new
evidence
before
the
administrative
agency.
this
decision
did
not
trigger
the
statute
of
limitations,
because
at
that
point
there
was
no
prevailing
party
in
the
litigation.
the
case
was
simply
remanded
for
the
taking
of
new
evidence.
a
few
months
later,
in
may
of
1985,
the
appeals
counsel
of
the
social
security
administration
found
this
petitioner
disabled,
and
later
in
that
year,
approximately
4
months
later,
benefits
were
actually
paid
to
this
petitioner.
in
may
of
1985,
approximately
5
months
after...
excuse
me,
8
months
after
that,
the
petitioner
filed
an
application
for
attorney
fees
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
that
was
considered
by
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
denied
attorney
fees
on
the
ground
that
the
government's
position
had
been
substantially
justified.
at
no
time
did
the
district
court
or
the
secretary
indicate
in
any
way
that
the
petition,
the
application
for
fees,
was
untimely.
petitioner
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
again
the
secretary
did
not
argue
that
the
petition,
the
application
was
untimely.
in
fact
the
case
was
fully
briefed,
and
after
that
full
briefing
but
before
argument,
the
ninth
circuit,
sua
sponte,
raised
the
issue
of
the
timeliness
of
the
fee
application,
although
the
sua
sponte
order
indicated
that
the
first
judgment
of
the
district
court
remanding
the
case
might
have
triggered
the
statute.
later,
however,
when
the
secretary
did
take
a
position
in
response
to
the
sua
sponte
order,
the
issue
became
whether
the
administrative
decision
could
trigger
the
limitations
period.
later
the
ninth
circuit
did
indeed
hold
that
the
administrative
decision
could
trigger
the
limitations
period
and
that
the
decision
of
the
administrative
agency
would
become
final
within
30
days
of
that
decision,
thus
triggering
that
a
fee
application
would
have
to
be
filed
within
30
days
of
that
administrative
decision.
the
secretary
originally
in
his
opposition
agreed
with
that
position,
but
on
the
merits,
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court
has
adjusted
his
position
somewhat
and
says
that
the
decision
of
the
administrative
agency
becomes
final
65
days
after
it
is
issued,
and
then
the
30-day
period
is
thus
triggered
after
that.
in
explaining
why
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
ought
to
be
reversed
we
want
to
focus
here
on
three
things:
the
statutory
language,
the
legislative
history,
and
some
practical
considerations
which
we
think
merit
reversal.
turning
first
to
the
statutory
language,
the
term
"judgment"
is
quite
clearly
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
a
federal
court,
and
that
is
indeed
the
language
used
by
congress.
decisions
of
administrative
agencies
simply
are
never
called
judgments.
the
secretary...
indeed
the
secretary
himself
does
not
call
any
of
his
decisions
judgments,
but
rather
decisions,
determinations,
denials
of
review,
and
such
like
that.
in
administrative
law
generally
administrative
agencies
make
awards,
issue
orders,
make
decisions,
rulings,
but
they
do
not
render
judgments.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
you're
referring,
of
course,
to
the
sullivan
v.
hudson
case.
mr.
brian
wolfman
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
if
there
is
existing
a
pending
civil
action,
that
administrative
decisions
on
remand
can
be
considered
part
of
that
civil
action
if
they
have
a
very
intimate
relationship
with
the
remand.
the
court
of
course
did
not
hold
that
administrative
proceedings
in
the
first
instance
are
compensable
under
the
eaja,
unless
of
course
there
are
adversary
proceedings
under
a
different
provision
of
the
eaja
section--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--those
particular
type
of
narrow...
the
narrow
exception
for
a
particular
type
of
proceedings
which
are
intimately
related
to
the
civil
action.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
would
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
they
are
two
entirely
different
phrases,
and
i
don't...
when
we
get
to
the
practical
considerations,
which
i
would
be
glad
to
address,
there
is
no
reason
to
expand
that.
i
think
in
the
sullivan
v.
hudson
case
the
court
was
expanding
upon
earlier
decisions
in
the
attorney
fee
area
that
said
administrative
proceedings
that
are
necessary
for
the
vindication
of
rights
that
are
asserted
in
that
civil
action
must
be
compensated,
or
you
would
really
make
illusory
the
purpose
behind
the
fee
statute.
i
don't
think
we
have
that
with
the
definition
of
"judgment".
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
in
this
particular
case
that
was
a
response
in
the
1985
amendments
to
the
law
which,
after
a
district
court,
for
instance,
issued
a
judgment,
congress
felt
it
was
best
not
to
force
the
applicant
to
file
a
fee
petition
while
the
government
could
still
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
for
the
purposes
of
efficiency,
to
have
everything
complete
in
the
district
court,
and
then
allow
the
period
to
run.
and
that
is
what
the
phrase
means.
it
makes...
it
is
not
a
reference
whatsoever
to
the
decision
making
of
administrative
tribunals.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct.
in
the
american
administrative
law
generally,
as
i
was
saying,
judgments
are
not
normally
issued...
never
are
issued
in
our
procedures.
indeed
the
apa,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
sets
definitions
for
scores
of
agency
proceedings...
before
scores
of
agencies,
and
it
uses
various
terminology
such
as
order,
disposition,
and
so
on,
but
never
the
term
judgment.
but
even
conceding
that
an
agency
could
call
its
decision
a
judgment,
the
question
here
is
what
congress
believed
when
it
enacted
the
eaja,
and
it
surely
drafted
that
terminology
with
the
ordinary
usage
in
mind.
indeed
at
four
different
points
in
the
provisions
that
are
before
the
court
today
the
term
"judgment"
is
used,
and
each
time
it
appears
to
be
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
a
court.
in
fact
twice
there
are
cross
references
to
other
statutes
which
talk
about
collecting
on
that
judgment,
the
clerk
tax...
the
clerk
of
the
court
taxing
court...
costs,
and
so
on.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever,
or
however,
that
there
is
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
brian
wolfman
it
could
be
either
party.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
and
is
still
as
a
matter
of
the
secretary's
practice,
and
the
secretary
still
tells
every
claimant
nationwide
that
he
will
go
back
and
file
certain
papers,
but
that
he
also
will
get
some
type
of
final
disposition
in
the
action.
so
ordinarily,
and
in
my
experience,
practicing
in
this
area,
has
been
the
secretary,
but
surely--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--frequently...
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
brian
wolfman
frequently
it
will
simply
dismiss
the
action
or
affirm
the
final
decision
of
the
appeals
counsel.
but
of
course
if
there
are
further
proceedings
to
be
taken,
that
the
party
is
not
fully
satisfied,
there
could
be
further
proceedings
on
the
merits.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct.
he
fully
won.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
that
is
true,
but
that
is
a
determination
that
we
make
in
hindsight.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
indeed
the
secretary's
practice
by
and
large.
it
did
not
happen
in
this
case,
but
my
experience
and
in
the
forms
attached
to
our
brief
it
is
clearly
the
secretary's
intention
to
do
that
in
every
case.
the
secretary
says
in
his
responding
brief
that
he
doesn't
intend
to
follow
that
practice
in
every
case
if
he
prevails
here,
a
concession
that
he
still
follows
that
practice
and
sends
forms
to
every
claimant
and
every
claimant's
representative
that
he
will
do
so
now.
the
eaja
itself
draws
the
distinction
i
am
suggesting
between
agency
decision
making
and
court
judicial
decision
making,
the
same
distinction
that
we
urge.
in
section
504
of
the
eaja,
the
part
which
pertains
to
work
done
only
at
the
administrative
level
in
adversary
proceedings
without
the
requirement
of
a
court
action,
the
fee
petition
must
be
filed
within
30
days
of
final
disposition
in
the
action,
where
in
the
provision
at
issue
here
for
work
associated
with
court
proceedings,
the
fee
application
must
be
filed
within
30
days
of
the
final
judgment,
as
we
have
said.
indeed,
taking
it
a
step
further,
section
504
says,
and
i
am
quoting
now,
the
party
shall
within
30
days
of
final
disposition
in
the
adversary
adjudication
submit
to
the
agency...
to
the
agency,
the
fee
application.
while
under
section
2412(d),
the
provision
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
party
shall
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
action,
and
i
am
quoting,
submit
to
the
court
the
fee
application.
now
this
juxtaposition
of
the
words
strongly
suggests
it
is
the
court
whose
judgment
triggers
the
limitations
period.
but
turning
to
the
legislative
history,
if
the
statute
left
any
doubt
as
to
the
validity
of
our
position,
the
1985
legislative
history
of
the
eaja
dispels
it.
the
legislative
history
refers
numerous
times
to
this
limitation
period,
and
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
is
being
referred
to.
and
this
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
as
to
what
is
a
final
judgment
that
is
not
appealable.
there
is
a
discussion
of
waiting
for
the
period
from
the
district
court's
judgment
to
expire
before
it
comes
final;
waiting
for
the
appellate
court's
decision
to
become
final...
in
other
words
when
the
period
for
filing
for
certiorari
expires;
and
even
a
reference
to
a
decision
of
this
court,
waiting
for
the
time
for
when
filing
a
petition
for
rehearing
expires.
but
never
is
there
a
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
could
be--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no,
your
honor.
if
such
a
petition
had
been
filed
fees
would
have
been
denied
because
the
party
seeking
fees
had
not
yet
prevailed.
that
is...
that's
in
fact
what
this
court
said
in
sullivan
v.
hudson,
and
follows
standard
attorney
fee
law--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that's
correct.
there
was...
well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
what
there
was
was
a
remand
at...
in
fact--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--it
was
a
judgment,
and
it
was
at
the
behest
of
the
secretary
and
it
was
remanded.
but
the
party
had
not
yet
prevailed.
and
in
fact
what
this
court
has
said
is
fees
cannot
be
obtained
on
what
may
ultimately
be
a
pyrrhic
legal
victory.
what
you
need
is
to
actually
get
what
you
want,
and
the
material
relationship
between
the
parties
had
not
been
altered.
the
secretary
does
not
contest
that
point
with
us.
most
importantly
as
to
the
legislative
history,
the
committee
report
actually
addressed
the
very
issue
before
the
court
today.
it
proved
the
existing
case
law
and
stated
that
in
this
context,
in
the
social
security
context,
the
administrative
decision
after
remand
is
not
a
final
judgment
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes,
and
only
a
post-remand
decision
of
some
sort
could
provide
that
trigger.
and
finally,
the
thrust
of
the
1985
amendments,
both
in
the
amendments
and
its
legislative
history,
were
generally...
was
to
eliminate
technical
barriers
to
fees
that
might
become
traps
for
the
unwary,
and
that
that
should
not
be
the
basis
for
denying
a
fee
application.
as
we
stated
in
this
case,
it
had
been
universally
the
law...
our
position
had
universally
been
the
law,
and
the
secretary
is
still
following
that
position
by
sending
these
forms
to
the
claimants.
that
would
really
thwart
the
purposes
of
congress
in
1985.
and
the
final
thing
i
would
like
to
turn
to
is
some
of
the
practical
considerations.
the
secretary
argues
that
our
view
would
place
a
great
administrative
burden
on
the
court.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
we
are
not
requiring
the
secretary
to
file
an
enormous
number
of
post-remand
pleadings
with
the
court.
if
there
is
a
reason
to
do
so
for
merits
litigation,
then
that
needs
to
be
done.
but
for
this
purpose,
to
trigger
the
statute,
all
that
is
necessary
is
some
type
of
post-remand
final
adjudication
that
discontinues
this
piece
of
litigation.
we
are
talking
about
a
one-page
form
order
that
can
be
gotten
by
the
secretary,
if
the
secretary
desires,
to
run
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
brian
wolfman
absolutely
not,
i
think,
and
there
is
two
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
if
a
judgment,
post-remand
judgment
was
necessary,
then
clearly
a
petitioner,
a
claimant,
an
applicant,
could
get
such
an
order.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
statute
says
that
in
order
to
trigger
the
limitations
period
that
the
30
days
runs
from
the
final
judgment.
the
statute
has
no
requirement
whatsoever
that
the
limitations
period
necessarily
run.
if
the
secretary
wants
to
provide
a
time
bar
and
put
the
onus
on
the
claimant,
he
can
do
so.
not
only
does
the
statute
not
indicate
that,
but
the
legislative
history
makes
quite
clear
that
applications
that
are
filed...
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
for
instance,
a
district
court
issues
a
memorandum
order
and
opinion
granting
summary,
in
effect
granting
summary
judgment,
but
the
court
does
not
until
much
later,
which
is
sometimes
the
case,
file
a
judgment
under
rule
58
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct.
you
have
to
have
prevailed
and
obtained
the
benefits
you
want,
but
there
does
not
need
to
be
that
piece
of
paper
filing...
dismissing
the
case,
in
order
to...
the
statute
of
limitations
need
not
run.
the
legislative
history
also
addresses
this
point,
rejects
a
previous
case
of
the
ninth
circuit
called
auke
bay,
saying
that
that
would
be
an
overly
technical
construction
to
simply
require
it.
now,
we're
not
suggesting
that
it
may
not
be
a
good
idea
for
either
party
or
for
the,
particularly
for
the
secretary
to
get
such
an
order.
and
as
i
said,
on
the
merits
this
is
what
the
secretary--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
means
that
after
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
the
case
that
the
applicant
has
30
days
in
which
to
file
a
fee
petition.
if
that
judgment
is
never
sought
or
obtained,
if
the
petitioner
has
prevailed
he
can
get
fees.
and
the
legislative
history,
as
i
said,
explicitly
addresses
that
scenario.
mr.
brian
wolfman
we
respectfully
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
language,
your
honor,
sets
the
outmost
time
in
which
someone
could
file
a
fee
application
if
there
exists
a
final
judgment.
as
judge
posner
said
in
the
mcdonald
case,
that
deadline...
that
is
not
a
starting
point,
it's
a
deadline.
it's
not
a
requirement,
but
it
is
a
deadline
if
it
does
exist.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
that--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
our
position
is
that,
but
that
occurs
only
if
the
secretary
allows
it
to--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--and
that
i
think
is
precisely
why
the
secretary
is
telling
every
claimant
around
the
nation
that
he
will
make
post-remand
filings
and
get
an
order.
but
as
you
suggest,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that
as
a
practical
matter.
one
of
those
answers
is
that
attorney
will
generally
file
because
he
wants
to
see
some
cash.
the
other
answer
is
that
this
will
happen
only
if
the
secretary
allows
it
to
occur.
it
will
not
otherwise
happen.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
right,
but
i
think
there
is
an
answer
to
that.
first
of
all
i
think
frequently
in
the
administrative...
not
always,
but
sometimes
in
the
administrative
context
that
first
order
may
in
fact
be
an
order
in
which
the
person
prevailed,
in
which
they
actually
got
some
or
all
of
what
they
wanted.
in
other
contexts
very
frequently
the
court
remanding
does
retain
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
indeed
expected,
like
it
was
in
this
context,
that
they
will
come
back
to
the
court.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct,
although
it
may--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
brian
wolfman
this
is
a
sentence
6.
it
was
a
remand
for
the
taking
of
new
evidence
before
there
was
any
decision
on
the
merits
by
the
court.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
absolutely
agree,
your
honor.
our
point,
however,
is
that
we
believe
that
the
secretary
is
absolutely
required
in
a
sentence
6
case
to
come
back
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
for
some
type
of
post-remand--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
correct,
and
perhaps...
our
view
is
that
that
is
not
a
major
problem.
it
requires
a
form
order
if
there
is
truly
nothing
further
to
happen
on
the
merits,
which
is
only
a
post
hoc
determination.
we
don't
know
that
when
the
administrative
decision
first
comes
down.
but
we're
not
saying
that
the
secretary
needs
to
file...
make
post-remand
filings
in
each
case
for
eaja
purposes.
we
completely
concur
with
your
suggestion
that
it's
absolutely
required
in
sentence
6
cases
on
the
merits.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
is.
and
the
reason
it
is
is
because
the
substance
of
what
occurred
in
the
district
court
is
that
the
secretary,
having
seen
evidence,
additional
evidence
that
was
not
previously
available
at
the
first
administrative
hearing,
asked
the
court
to
remand
the
case
to
consider
that
new
evidence.
that
is
a
particular
provision
that
makes
for
a
sentence
6
remand.
mr.
brian
wolfman
at
what
point,
your
honor?
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--indeed
i
think
that's...
that
is
a
possibility.
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
interim
fees,
if
you
will,
are
permitted
under
this
statute,
and
sometimes
that
is
necessary
in
litigation
in
which
you
have
prevailed
on
a
substantial
amount
of
what
has
occurred
but
you
haven't
completed
all
your
work,
there
is
some
post-judgment
work
to
be
done.
and
case
law
generally
permits
that.
but
that's
one
of
the
nice
things
about
our
approach,
because
in
this
case,
where
it
usually
is
pretty
much
over
if
the
remand
decision
is
favorable,
and
we
can
tell
that
by
the
time
it
gets
back
to
the
district
court,
then
that
decision,
if
the
secretary
desires
to
get
that
judgment
as
he
says
he
will
do
in
every
case,
then
that
will
pretty
much
be
the
time
where
the
entire
petition
with
all
the
work
can
be
presented
to
the
district
court.
so
i
think
that's
one
of
the
nice
things
about
the
position
that
we
take,
not
only
that
it
comports
with
the
statute
that
congress
has
drafted.
indeed,
just
to
finish
up
on
some
of
the
practical
considerations,
we
have
explained--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--it
was
not
before
the
answer.
mr.
brian
wolfman
sentence
6
has
two
categories
of
remands.
one
is
the
one
before
he
files
an
answer.
mr.
brian
wolfman
the
court
did
not
order,
but
that
was
the
substance
of
what
occurred.
indeed,
that's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
brian
wolfman
did
the
court
order
additional
evidence?
mr.
brian
wolfman
not
in
the
words
of
its
remand
order,
no.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
and
the
reason
is
that
in
substance
what
had
occurred
is
that
the
secretary
learned
of
new
evidence.
and
sentence
6
provides
that
either
party
can
ask
for
a
remand.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no.
under
sentence
6
either
party
can
ask
for
the
second
type
of
remand,
and
then
the
court
may
order
such
a
remand
if
there
is
good
cause
and
if
there
is
new
evidence.
mr.
brian
wolfman
and
the
fact
is
that
is
not
necessarily
perfectly
recited
in
every
remand
order.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
the
secretary's
position
is
unworkable.
if,
indeed,
we're
going
to
have
eaja
petitions...
the
timeliness
of
eaja
petitions,
depending
on
whether
it's
a
4
sentence
or
6
sentence
remand,
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
to
determine
in
each
case
without
getting
into
the
substance
of
each
case.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes.
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
award.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes.
i
think
that...
i
think,
whether
he
would
have
been
in
contempt
of
court,
i
think
if
i
were
representing
the
claimant
i
would
have
come
back
to
the
court
and
explained
what
had
transpired.
it
would
have
been
a
breach
of
what
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
in
this
case.
it's
very
clear
if
you,
the
briefs
that
are
in
the
record
in
this
case,
both
in
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit,
which
are
cited
in
my
brief,
make
clear
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
look
at
some
additional
evidence,
a
small
bit
of
additional
evidence
that
had
arisen.
in
fact
cases
are
not
remanded,
in
my
experience,
simply
to
take
another
shot
at
it.
that's
not
the
purpose
of
it.
it
is
to
take
another
look
at
evidence
under
that
second
clause
of
sentence
6.
and
it
is
one
reason
under
the
practical
considerations
that
we
want
the
court
to
consider
why
this
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
the
eaja,
because
as
the
secretary
concedes
in
his
brief,
these
remand
orders
are
often
very
short
and
boilerplate
in
nature,
and
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
substance
of
what
occurred
to
determine
when
it
was
timely.
rather,
under
our
view,
you
need
a
judgment
of
the
district
court,
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
fourth
or
sixth
sentence
case.
you
need
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
trigger
this
limitations
period.
our
position
therefore
fixes
one
time
deadline
for
the
filing
of
all
eaja
petitions.
but
more
importantly,
it
comports
with
the
statute
that
congress
has
written.
mr.
brian
wolfman
very
briefly,
your
honor.
first
to
respond
to
justice
stevens.
approximately
93
percent
of
all
eaja
petitions
were
in
the
social
security
context
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
and
it
is
simply
not
the
case
that
the
secretary's
position
differed
in
different
judicial
districts.
in
my
experience,
and
as
evidenced
by
the
form
presented
to
the
court,
they
promised
every
claimant,
and
continue
to
promise
every
claimant,
to
go
back
to
the
district
court.
now,
what
is
being
proposed--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
not
my
experience.
what
is
being
suggested
here
is
this
microscopic
look
at
the
difference
between
a
sentence
4
and
sentence
6
remand,
which
serves
no
purposes
of
the
eaja,
not
to
mention
the
next
time
we
come
back
to
this
court
with
a
hybrid
sentence
4/sentence
6
case,
or
looking
at
the
particular
problems
with
other
agencies
or
situations
where
there
was
a
district
court
order.
