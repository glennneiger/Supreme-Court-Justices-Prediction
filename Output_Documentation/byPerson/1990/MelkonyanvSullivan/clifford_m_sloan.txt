mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
imposes
a
time
limitation
on
applications
for
attorneys'
fees.
the
act
requires
that
an
application
for
attorneys'
fees
be
filed
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
action.
in
our
view
the
secretary's
post-remand
decision
is
the
final
judgment
in
the
action,
when
it
is
final
and
not
appealable,
and
has
therefore
effectively
terminated
the
action
on
the
merits.
we
believe
that
this
interpretation
is
the
correct
reading
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
and
the
social
security
act,
and
that
it
is
strongly
supported
by
this
court's
decisions
in
hudson
and
in
finkelstein.
we
also
believe
that
it
provides
a
fair
and
practicable
approach
for
all
concerned.
petitioner's
interpretation
is
that
courts
must
enter
orders
solely
to
start
the
attorneys'
fees
clock
running,
and
that
if
they
do
not
do
so
there
is
simply
no
attorneys'
fees
time
limitation
at
all.
we
believe
the
petitioner's
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
governing
statutes,
and
that
it
mandates
a
cumbersome
procedure
which
is
neither
compelled
nor
warranted
by
the
governing
statutes.
this
court's
decisions
in
hudson
and
in
finkelstein
greatly
clarify
the
issue
in
this
case.
in
hudson
the
court
held
that
post-remand
administrative
proceedings
are
part
of
the
civil
action
for
which
attorneys'
fees
can
be
recovered.
by
an
analogous
principle,
the
event
that
conclusively
resolves
those
proceedings
should
be
considered
the
final
judgment
in
the
action.
indeed
in
hudson
it
was
argued
to
the
court
that
civil
actions
should
be
interpreted
solely
with
respect
to
events
that
happen
in
a
courtroom,
and
the
court
rejected
that
position.
by
a
similar
principle
the
court
should
also
reject
petitioner's
argument
that
the
final
judgment
in
the
action
is
only
something
that
can
occur
in
the
court
and
cannot
be--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--it
is
a
relatively
new
position,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
the...
yes.
and
this
has
been
a
difficult
issue
for
the
secretary,
for
the
government
generally.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
i
cannot
stand
here
and
say
that
our
position
on
this
issue
has
been
clear
and
consistent,
because
it
has
not.
but
we
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is
clear
now,
particularly
in
light
of
the
court's
decisions
in
hudson
and
in
finkelstein,
which
have
greatly
clarified
the
landscape.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
it
is
based
on
those
two
decisions
in
that
we
believe
that
they
greatly
clarify
the
issue
and
support
it.
we
think
that
this
is
a
clear
answer
from
the
reading
of
the
statutes
in
any
event.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
argument,
your
honor,
but--
[laughter]
but
we
would,
because
as
petitioner
pointed
out,
the
remand
order
itself
is
not,
does
not
entitle
somebody
to
prevailing
party
status.
what
would
entitle
them
to
prevailing
party
status
is
if
they
succeed
in
the
post-remand
administrative
proceeding.
and
so
even
if
those
post-remand
administrative
proceedings
are
not
part
of
the
civil
action
for
purposes
of
recovering
attorneys'
fees,
it
has
a
critical
significance
in
the
act
because
the
conclusion
of
those
post-remand
administrative
proceedings
defines
the
time
when
somebody
is
the
prevailing
party.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
i
would
make
two
points
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
question
is
whether,
even
in
these
mammoth
proceedings
that
have
dragged
on,
what
is
the
point
at
which
they
have
become
final
and
no
longer
reviewable.
and
there
is
a
definite
point
to
that,
and
it's
one
the
courts
have
to
resolve
in
any
case
in
determining
whether
further
review
in
the
court
would
be
timely,
and
the
statutes
are
structured
in
such
a
way
that
a
party
knows
his
rights
and
knows
when
review
is
still
available
and
when
review
has
run
out.
and
when
review
has
run
out,
the
proceedings
have
been
terminated
on
the
merits.
the
second
point,
though,
is
that
this
brings
up
a
fundamental
point
about
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
and
a
fundamental
problem
in
petitioner's
position.
and
that
is
that
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
takes
other
statutes
and
statutory
schemes
as
it
finds
them.
it
does
not
impose
additional
requirements
of
its
own
force
on
those
statutory
schemes.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
difficulties
in
complicated...
other
statutes
and
administrative
proceedings,
the
difficulty
is
in
those
proceedings.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
attorneys'
fees
statute
itself
has
some
kind
of
power
or
authority
to
impose
additional
requirements
on
the
administration
of
those
statutory
schemes
solely
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
attorneys'
fees
applications,
which
is
the
burden
of
petitioner's
position,
that
somehow
the
attorneys'
fees
statute,
which
in
its
structure
is
designed
to
allow
for
the
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees
for
actions
in
other
proceedings,
somehow
has
the
power
to
engraft
additional
requirements
onto
the
administration
of
those
schemes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
it's
possible
the
petitioner
would
say
well,
it
doesn't
matter
because
he
can
go
back
at
any
time
in
terms
of
timeliness.
but
i
guess
in
terms
of
the
prevailing
party
issue,
that
would
certainly
suggest,
if
he
wants
to
establish
that
he
is
the
prevailing
party--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that
enables
him
to
go
back
as
a
prevailing
party.
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
there
are--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--it
has
been
the
general
view
that
filings
are
appropriate,
not
necessarily
getting
additional
orders.
and
let
me
distinguish
between
the
two.
the
forms
that
petitioner
refers
to
refers
to
making
filings
in
the
district
court.
even
with
respect
to
filings
it
is
my
understanding,
i
have
been
informed
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
that
that
has
been
the
general
view
of
the
secretary.
in
fact
the
practice
has--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that
there
would
be
filings
in
the
district
court.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
of
the
transcript
and
the
decision
on
remand,
that
the--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--sometimes.
that...
it
appears
that
the
view
on
that,
which
has
been...
first
of
all,
the
general
view
on
filings
is
in
forms
and
so
on.
there's
not
a
regulation
that
speaks
to
it.
the
view
on
seeking
orders
and
so
on
seems
to
have
been
less
crystallized
than
the
view
on
seeking
filings.
the
forms
that
he
refers
to--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice,
it's
just
that
it's
been
a
complicated
area.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
okay.
if
the
question
is
has
it
been
the
general
practice
that
there
be
a
request
for
orders,
it
is
my
understanding
that
has
not
been
the
uniform
practice.
it
has
been--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
because
there
was
a
lot
of
confusion
on
this
issue,
frankly,
justice
white.
[laughter]
there
has
been,
and
it
is...
it
is
our
belief
that
the
issue
has
now
been
greatly
clarified.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
a
final
judgment
of
a
court
is
not
necessary
for
a
claimant
to
file
for
fees.
but--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--under
his
view,
and
we
think
that's
a
flaw
in
his
view.
if
i
could
just
elaborate
on
my
earlier
answer--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
we
would
think
that
in
that
circumstance
it
would
be
appropriate
to
get
something
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
the
logic
of
petitioner's
position
is
that
it
would
be
proper
under
his
view.
but
let
me
just
distinguish
this
situation
from
the
situations
that
petitioner
is
trying
to
align
himself
with.
the
typical
circumstance
in
which
someone
can
file
for
attorneys'
fees
before
a
final
judgment
would
be,
for
example,
if
it
is
in
the
district
court
and
it's
going
to
go
up
on
appeal
and
somebody
files
for
attorneys'
fees
so
that
in
the
interest
of
judicial
economy
the
fees
and
the
merits
can
go
up
at
once.
the
government
has
not
opposed
that
practice,
and
we
think
it's
allowed
under
the
statute.
but
the
critical
difference
in
that
kind
of
situation
is
there
will
ultimately
be
a
final
judgment
in
the
action.
it
won't
be
permanently
open-ended
in
the
way
that
petitioner
is
arguing
for
here.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
problem
with
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--because
the
30-day
time
limitation
is
a
central
part
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
when
congress
passed
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
it
did
not
in
the
act
make
the
choice
that
you're
suggesting,
that
it
would
rely
on
attorneys'
incentives,
and
they're
going
to
be
hungry
for
cash
and
so
they'll
go
to
court.
congress
made
a
different
choice.
it
specifically
imposed
a
30-day
time
limitation.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
first
of
all
the
structure
of
the
act
puts
the
burden
on
the
applicant
for
fees
to
go
to
court,
and
that
gets
to
the
other
half
of
petitioner's
argument,
that
if
they
want
an
attorney
fee...
if
the
government
wants
an
attorney
fee
time
limitation,
the
government
can
simply
go
to
court
and
seek
some
kind
of
order.
and
so
therefore
if
the
government
wants
there
to
be
any
time
limitation,
the
government
has
to
go
through
this
additional
procedural
requirement
that
isn't
contemplated
by
the
social
security
act,
and
that
is,
in
many
cases
would
be
a
useless
filing
because
there
are
many
cases
in
which
attorneys'
fees
are
not
sought,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
they
are
not
contested,
and
it
would
require
the
district
court
to
enter
orders
in
thousands
of
cases--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no
provision
of
law,
your
honor.
what
justice
white
was
referring
to
is
an
order
to
get
the
attorneys'
fees
clock
running.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
to
issue
an
order.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
there
is
not.
and
the
result
would
be
that
the
alternative
that
justice
white
was
suggesting
would
not
in
fact
start
the
attorneys'
fees
clock.
so
even
in
that
instance
there
would
be
no
attorneys'
fees
time
limitation.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
one
would
ordinarily
expect
the
district
court
to
act
on
that
motion.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
i
would
think
that
he
would,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
he
could
deny
the
motion.
he
would
have
to
act
on
the
motion,
but
he
would.
and
indeed
in
this
case
there's,
provides
a
good
example
of
a
district
court
that
would
likely
react
that
way,
and
it
illustrates
why,
contrary
to
petitioner's
submission,
this
is
not
a
sentence
6
remand.
the
district
court's
order
said
it
is
remanded
for
all
further
proceedings,
period.
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
in
that
remand
order
that
it
was
contemplated
that
it
would
come
back
to
court.
and
it
would
seem
likely
that
a
district
court
would
be
surprised
if
a
year
later
or
a
few
months
later
somebody
came
back
and
said
okay,
now
dismiss
this
action,
when
the
district
court
had
specifically
said
it
is
remanded
for
all
further
proceedings,
period.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
no--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
the
judge
does
not.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
no,
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
precluding,
but
it
does
mean
that
a
party
that
is
not
satisfied
with
the
result
would
have
to
come
back.
and
in
finkelstein
the
court
said
that
every
final
decision
of
the
secretary
is
reviewable
in
a
separate
piece
of
litigation.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
district
court
would
be
surprised
if
the
claimant
or
if
the
secretary
came
back
when
neither
was
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
as
to--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
it's
a
new
piece
of
litigation.
whether
it
has
to
be
a
separate
lawsuit
is
something
that
could
perhaps
be
addressed
by
local
district
court
practice.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
that
is
a
substantive
difference,
but
it
would--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
this
is...
i
was
trying
to
elaborate
on
the
problems
with
saying
whether
normally
or
not,
and--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
as
to
whether
it
was
unusual
that
the
u.s.
attorney
did
not
go
back,
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
before,
at
the
risk
of
sounding
nonresponsive,
which
was
that
the
practice
varied
in
local
u.s.
attorneys'
offices.
it
varied
according
to
a
number
of
variables,
as
i
understand
it,
what
people
thought
that
the
local
district
court
would
expect,
the
particular
kind
of
order...
all
kinds
of
variables.
there
was
a
general
view
on
the
part
of
the
department
that
it
was
appropriate
to
go
back
and
make
the
filings,
but
the
practice
was
varied.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
to
go
back
to
the
district
court?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
i
am
not
aware
of
such
a
practice.
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
to
my
knowledge
the
practice
is
not.
and
in
part,
part
of
the
practice
here
has
grown
up
in
the
particular
context
of
the
social
security
act
administration,
in
which
there
is
a
very
high
percentage
of
remands
of
district
court
actions,
and
also
in
which
there
is--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
we
believe
that
it
is
inapplicable
to
this
case
because,
as
the
court
clarified
in
finkelstein,
that
would
apply
in
a
sentence
6
remand,
and
we
believe
this
was
not
a
sentence
6
remand.
and
the
court
had
addressed
the
comments
in
hudson
in
its
decision
in
finkelstein,
it
said
that
that
applies
to
sentence
6
remands
rather
than
to
all
other
remands.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
it
is.
the
action
was
filed
pursuant
to
405(g).
there
is
a
provision...
405(g)
applies
to
title
ii
of
the
social
security
act.
this
was
under
title
xvi,
and
there's
a
provision
in
title
xvi
that
incorporates
405(g)
by
reference.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
it
acted
under
an
implied
authority
as
part
of
405(g).
this
was
not
a
sentence
4
remand
either,
but
it
was--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
one
could
view
it
that
way,
or
also
as
an
incident
to
the
grant
of
authority
in
405(g)
itself.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
as
the
court
clarified
in
finkelstein,
it
should
be
read
as
being
limited
to
sentence
6
remands.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
we
are
relying
on
hudson
and
finkelstein
taken
together,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
we
do
take
that
position,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
distinction
between
sentence
6
remands
and
other
remands
is
important
because
it
illustrates
the
difference
between
the
kind
of
remand
that
is
contemplated
under
sentence
6,
in
which
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
explicitly
and
it
remands
only
for
a
very
limited
purpose,
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
and
then
it
is
specifically
envisioned
in
sentence
6
that
it
will
come
back
to
the
court,
as
opposed
to
the
situation
in
other
remands.
because
of
the
special
category
of
sentence
6
remands
and
its
implications
both
for
the
administrative
action
and
for
the
district
court,
we
suggest
that
it's
appropriate
to
have
a
clear
statement
rule
with
respect
to
sentence
6
remands.
and
if
the
court
wants
to
take
the
action
of
retaining
jurisdiction
and
requiring
additional
filings
and
additional
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
should
clearly
and
unequivocally
say
so,
because
of
the
special
nature
of
these
sentence
6
remands.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
there
are.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
to
go
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
for
a
remand
based--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--it
could
send
it
back
for
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
for
a
clarification
of
the
administrative
record.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
if
it
was
pursuant
to
a
provision
that
explicitly
required
coming
back
to
the
court
for
further
proceedings,
yes,
we
would.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
or
of
the
court's
order.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
we
would
urge
in
those
other
contexts
as
well
that
there
should
be
a
plain
statement
rule
in
terms
of
remands.
that
if
the
court
wants
to
take
the
exceptional
step
or
the
burdensome,
in
some
respects,
step...
i
was
hesitating
to
say
that...
but
the
burdensome
step
of
retaining
jurisdiction
and
absolutely
requiring
further
proceedings,
the
court
should
clearly
say
so.
and
then
if
the
court
does
not
clearly
say
so,
the
inference
should
be
the
other
way.
now,
petitioner
has
emphasized
as
a
great
practical
problem
with
our
approach
the
fact
that
it
requires
distinguishing
between
sentence
6
remands
and
other
remands,
but
the
key
point
about
that
is
that
we're
not
creating
that
distinction.
the
social
security
act
creates
that
distinction,
and
this
court
elaborated
on
that
distinction
in
finkelstein.
and
again
this
relates
to
that
fundamental
principle
of
the
attorneys'
fees
statute,
that
it
takes
the
other
statutory
and
regulatory
schemes
as
it
finds
them.
it
does
not
impose
upon
them,
it
does...
or
change
them
in
any
way
to
the
extent
that
the
distinction
between
sixth
sentence
remands
and
other
remands
is
difficult.
it's
a
difficultly,
number
one,
that
is
created
by
the
statute
itself,
and
number
two,
that
we
think
could
be
plainly
resolved
by
this
kind
of
plain
statement
rule.
now,
there
is
an
apparent
anomaly
even
in
a
sixth
sentence
case
about
the
fact
that
a
fully
favorable
decision
to
the
claimant
still
has
to
come
back
to
the
court
for
additional
proceedings.
and
we
would
suggest
that
that
anomaly
could
be
resolved
by
relatively
simple
practice
that
would
allow
sixth
sentence
remands
and
other
remands
to
be
treated
essentially
the
same
in
this
context.
and
what
that
would
be
is
that
at
the
time
that
a
sixth
sentence
remand
was
going
to
be
ordered
by
the
court,
the
government
could
simply
in
each
case
ask
that
there
be
a
provision
in
the
court's
remand
order
that
jurisdiction
would
terminate
65
days
or
whatever
the
period
of
review
was
after
the
administrative
decision,
unless
any
party
brought
it
back
to
the
court.
and
the
result
of
that
would
be
that
you
would
have
a
final
judgment
at
exactly
the
same
time
that
you
have
in
other
remands,
but
it
would
be
faithful
to
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
district
court
is
setting
the
terms
of
its
jurisdiction
under
a
sixth
sentence
remand.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
correct.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
there
is,
but
we
would
not
think
that
that
keeps
open
the
action
on
the
merits.
that's
an
entirely
separate
matter,
the
amount
of
benefits,
and
it
is
treated
as
such
in
the
secretary's
regulations.
and
if
one
wanted
to
challenge
the
benefits
determination
that
would
require
new
administrative
appeals,
it
would
require
a
new
request
for
judicial
action.
in
fact,
benefits
determinations
are
typically
fairly
routine
and
do
not
engender
that
type
of
complicated
administrative
appeals
and
judicial
appeals.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
it,
in
our
view,
your
honor...
that
was
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
took.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
right.
and
that...
what
we
would
say
the
appropriate
position
would
be
is
that
after
the
appeals
counsel's
decision,
then
there
is
65
days
for
review...
5
days
presumed
for
mailing
of
the
notice,
and
60
days.
and
at
that
point
if
there
is
no
further
review,
the
appeals
counsel's
decision
has
become
final
and
not
appealable,
and
the
30
days
would
begin
at
that
time.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate
to
have
regulations
on
that.
the
general
regulation
on
review
of
appeals
counsel
decisions
is
it
is
clear
under
the
existing
regulations--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--but,
were
you
referring
specifically
to
a
regulation
directed
to
eaja?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate
to
have
the
administrative
documents
be
as
clear
as
possible
on
that
so
that
everybody
knows
what
the
applicable
rule
is.
as
we
have
said,
we
think
it's
clear
under
the
existing
regulations
that
there
is
the
65-day
period
for
review
of
the
appeals
counsel
decision.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that...
and
to
the
extent
that
it's
not,
administrative
clarification
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
your
honor,
i
was
not
saying
at
all
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
secretary
says
something
means
he
won't
come
back.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
the
secretary
can
ask
the
district
court
to
include
in
its
remand
order
a
provision
which
says
that
the
district
court's...
my
jurisdiction
will
terminate
65
days
after
the
appeals
counsel
issues
its
decision
unless--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--okay.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
we're
defending
the
ninth--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--we're
defending
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we're
defending
their
decision
with
modification,
because
in
their
view
because
it
was
fully
favorable
to
the
claimant
it
became
a
final
judgment
on
the
day
that
it
was
issued.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
and
we
would
have
the
65-day
for
review
as
the
calculation.
