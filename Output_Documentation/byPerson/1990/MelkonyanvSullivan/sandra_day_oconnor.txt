justice
o'connor
mr.
wolfman,
in
circumstances
such
as
we
have
in
this
case,
where
your
client
obtained
the
relief
sought
and
where
the
government
is
precluded
from
filing
any
appeal,
who
is
it
that's
going
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
get
a
judgment,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
and
do
i
understand
you
to
say
this
is
in
your
view
a
sentence
6
remand
case
here?
justice
o'connor
mr.
sloan,
as
your
exchange
with
justice
scalia
illustrates,
at
least
if
it
was
necessary
to
get
a
judgment
from
the
district
court,
everyone
would
then
know
what
triggers
the
time
limit,
i
suppose.
justice
o'connor
that
would
be
the
positive
side
of
that
interpretation.
now,
has
the
secretary
in
fact
been
returning
to
the
district
court
even
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
applicant
has
fully
prevailed
on
remand
in
order
to
get
a
judgment?
justice
o'connor
the
petitioner's
attorney
referred
to
some
form
and
some
rather
uniform
practice
that
the
secretary...
has
that
been
the
secretary's
practice
generally?
justice
o'connor
that
what
has
been
the
general
view?
justice
o'connor
a
filing
of
what?
justice
o'connor
and
a
request
for
an
order
of
dismissal
or
something
of
the
sort?
justice
o'connor
at
least
you
want
us
to
complete
it?
and
i
take
it
you
do
take
the
position
that
if
it
is
a
sentence
6
remand
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
there
would
have
to
be
a
final
judgment
from
that
court?
justice
o'connor
so
we're
only
talking
here
about
what,
sentence
4
remands
and
this
other
vague
implied
remand
that
you
say
exists
under
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
case
arises
from
petitioner
melkonyan’s
application
for
social
security
disability
benefits.
the
petitioner’s
application
was
denied
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
on
the
grounds
that
the
petitioner
was
not
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
social
security
act.
petitioner,
then
filed
a
civil
action
pursuant
to
42
united
states
code
section
405(g)
which
is
a
statute
authorizing
judicial
review
of
adverse
determinations
of
social
security
claims.
while
the
case
was
pending,
the
petitioner
filed
a
new
application
for
benefits
and
supplied
additional
evidence
of
disability.
petitioner’s
second
application
for
benefits
was
approved
by
the
secretary.
the
secretary
then
asked
the
district
court
to
remand
the
pending
civil
case
to
the
agency
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
new
evidence.
with
petitioner’s
agreement,
the
court
issued
an
order
remanding
the
case
to
the
secretary
for
all
further
proceedings.
on
remand,
the
first
decision
of
the
secretary
was
vacated
and
petitioner
was
found
disabled
as
of
his
original
application
date.
more
than
a
year
later,
the
petitioner
applied
to
the
district
court
for
attorney’s
fees
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
the
acronym
for
which
is
eaja.
that
act
authorizes
an
award
of
fees
and
expenses
to
a
party
prevailing
against
the
united
states
in
a
civil
action
upon
application
made
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
and
reaction.
the
district
court
denied
the
request
on
the
ground
that
the
secretary’s
position
in
the
litigation
had
been
substantially
justified.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
but
on
the
basis
that
the
petition
was
untimely
because
it
was
not
filed
within
30
days
of
the
final
judgment.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
secretary’s
determination
on
the
administrative
remand
a
year
earlier,
granting
the
requested
relief
was
the
final
judgment
that
triggered
the
eaja
filing
deadline.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
an
administrative
determination
can
be
a
final
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
unanimously
hold
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion
that
the
required
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
must
be
rendered
by
a
court
of
law
rather
than
by
an
administrative
agency.
it
is
not
clear
on
this
record
whether
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
attorney’s
fees.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
