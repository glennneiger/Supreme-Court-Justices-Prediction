justice
stevens
well,
but
mr.
sloan,
is
it
correct
there
is
no
provision
of
law
that
requires
an
order?
if
the
form
that's
in
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix
is
followed,
where
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
the,
if
it
is
issued
a
favorable
decision
and
the
u.s.
attorneys
if
appropriate
have
the
action
discontinued
or
dismissed.
if
the
u.s.
attorney
then
filed
a
motion
to
discontinue
or
to
dismiss
the
action
there
would
be
a
provision
of
law
that
would
require
the
judge
to
rule
on
that
motion,
wouldn't
there?
you
can't
just
let
motions
sit
forever.
would
it
not
be
the
duty
of
the
district
court
to
act
on
a
motion
if
the
u.s.
attorney
filed
one
saying...
reciting
what
had
happened
and
saying
it
is
therefore
prayed
that
the
action
be
dismissed
or
discontinued?
justice
stevens
but
he'd
have
a
legal
duty
to
do
so,
would
he
not?
justice
stevens
oh,
but
that
can't
be
right,
mr.
sloan.
supposing
they
had
the
further
proceedings
and
the
petitioner
lost?
he
didn't
get
his
money.
you
don't
think
the
judge
would
expect
him
to
come
back
and
renew
his
appeal?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
know
at
that
point
the
secretary
is
going
to
give
the
award,
does
he?
does
the
judge?
justice
stevens
so
he
can't
by
those
all
further
proceedings
mean
he
is
precluding
any
further
review
by
him
or
her.
justice
stevens
well,
the
form
that
you
use
seems
to
contemplate
using
the
same
number.
they've
got
the
number
of
the
case
on
it,
say
please
take
this
to
court.
isn't
it
routinely
done?
i
mean,
this
case,
this,
the
u.s.
attorney
just
failed
to
act
on
this.
isn't
it
normally,
normal
that
he
would
act
on
this
form
request?
justice
stevens
is
it
also...
not
also
true
that
a
very
high
percentage
of
eaja
applications
are
in
social
security
act
cases?
justice
stevens
mr.
sloan,
can
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
sequence
in
this
case?
as
i
remember
the
chronology
it
was,
according
to
their
brief,
on
may
7th,
the...
'85,
they...
appeals
counsel
announced
that
they
decided
the
man
was
disabled.
justice
stevens
and
then
subsequently
he
got
a
check
for
his
back
award.
is
it
occasionally
the
case
that
there
will
be
a
finding
of
disability,
but
remaining
some
possible
dispute
over
the
amount,
specific
amount,
due
him?
justice
stevens
so
the
clock
would
start
to
run
from
the
time
that
the
appeals
counsel
announced
that
they
agree
the
man
is
disabled?
justice
stevens
i
don't
mean
to...
the
calculation
of
the
time
when
the
clock
would
start
to
run
would
have
that
as
its
initial
reference
point?
justice
stevens
right.
does
the
secretary
contemplate
issuing
regulations
for
the
benefit
of
the
lawyer
who
has
this
kind
of
case
only
once
in
a
while
and
wouldn't
know
when
that
time
period
would
run?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
yeah.
it
appears
to
me
that
there
probably
are
some
neighborhood
lawyers
who
get
this
kind
of
case
and
are
not
specialists
in
the
field,
and
might
not
realize
that
the
final
judgment
is
something
that
occurs
65
days
after
the
end
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
justice
stevens
right.
but
it
might
not
be
perfectly
clear
to
the
average
lawyer
that
that's
the
final
judgment
date,
65
days
in
the
future
after
that.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
may
be
true
that
the
u.s.
attorney's
position
has
been
different
in
different
cities.
sometimes
they
may
just
file
a
form
away
and
sometimes
they
may
go
into
court
with
it.
