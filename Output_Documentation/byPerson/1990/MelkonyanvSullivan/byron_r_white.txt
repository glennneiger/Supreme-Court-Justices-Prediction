what
kind
of
a
judgment
does
the
court
enter?
justice
white
what
does
it
say?
justice
white
well,
what
does
it
say?
justice
white
here
your
client
won
before
the
secretary.
justice
white
and
there
was
nothing
else
going
on
in
the
administrative
agency?
justice
white
yes,
yes.
so,
you
say
the
secretary's
practice
is
to
go
up
after
that
to
the
court
and
have
a
judgment
entered?
justice
white
could
you
have
filed
a
petition
for
fees
when
the
court
entered...
within
30
days
after
the
court
entered
its
remand?
justice
white
you
mean
it
hadn't
finally
prevailed,
but
it,
you
had
prevailed
in
the
court.
justice
white
and
that
was
certainly
a
final
judgment
then.
justice
white
well,
it
was
still
a
final
judgment.
justice
white
well,
you
could,
on
your
theory
you
could
wait,
you
could
wait
a
couple
of
years
after
you
prevail,
i
don't
suppose
you
would
because
you
want
your
money,
but
you
could
wait
a
year
and
never
have
a
final
judgment,
and
anytime
you
wanted
to
you
could
just
file
for
fees?
is
that...
that's
your
position,
i
take
it?
justice
white
i
would
suppose
the
requirement
for
being
relatively
prompt
at
filing
fees
indicates
that
there
should
in
all
cases
be
some
sort
of
a
deadline.
justice
white
is
this
a
relatively
new
position
of
the
secretary,
or--
justice
white
--like
real
new?
justice
white
well,
why
did
he
ever
file
anything,
then?
justice
white
why
is...
why
is
this
such
a
big
issue?
do
you
agree
that
without...
do
you
agree
that
a
judgment
of
a
court
is
not
necessary
in
order
for
a
successful
claimant
to
file
for
fees?
justice
white
so
the
claimant
could...
if
you
didn't
go
to
court
and
get
an
order,
the
claimant
can
just
wait
around
and
file
for
fees
whenever
he
wants
to?
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
we
don't
buy
your
notion
that
the
secretary's
final
order
is
a
final
judgment.
then
do
you
agree
that
the
claimant
could
just
wait
forever
to
file
for
fees,
without
getting
a
final
judgment?
justice
white
appropriate,
but
suppose
he
doesn't
get
a
judgment
and
neither
do
you,
but
he
files
for
fees.
would
that
be
proper?
justice
white
i
kind
of...
i
sort
of
wonder
why
the
case
is
even
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
want
to
avoid
the
bother
of
going
up
to
the
district
court,
why,
you
just
don't
need
to
go.
and
the
claimant
can
go
and
file
for
fees
whenever
he
wants
to.
and
normally
you
would
think
that
they
would
be
rather
prompt
in
trying
to
get
their
money.
justice
white
why
is
it
such
a
big
bother
for
the
secretary?
justice
white
well,
you
can...
if
that
really
worries
you,
you
can
go
and
start
the
clock
running
just
by
filing
your
piece
of
paper
and
asking
for
an
order.
justice
white
--are
you...
is
the
government
defending
the
ninth
circuit
decision--
justice
white
--and
the
reasoning?
justice
white
and
it
was
not
appealable.
