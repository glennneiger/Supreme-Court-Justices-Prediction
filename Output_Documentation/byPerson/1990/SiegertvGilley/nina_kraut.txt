ms.
nina
kraut
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
malice.
it's
a
case
in
which
a
federal
official
with
knowledge
of
false
information
communicated
and
published
that
false
information
anyway
to
a
third
person,
because
he
was
bent
on
ruining
and
destroying
frederick
siegert's
reputation
and
good
standing
in
his
professional
community.
this
is
a
case
which
stays
a
compensable
injury
to
a
protected
liberty
interest.
this
is
a
case
of
a
substantive
due
process
claims,
pure
and
simple
and
without
question.
in
1966
in
a
case
called
rosenblatt
v.
bear,
justice
stewart,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
stated
that
the
right
to
protect
one's
reputation
is
comparable
to
the
right
to
protect
one's
life
itself.
and
he
also
stated
that
the
right
to
protect
one's
reputation
is
a
fundamental
right
within
the
concept
of
liberty.
fifty
years
earlier
in
a
case
called
adams
v.
turner,
a
1917
case,
this
court
stated
something
very
similar
when
it
said
that
when
you
take
the
property
upon
which
my
house
sits,
you
take
my
house,
and
when
you
take
the
means
whereby
i
live,
you
take
my
life.
that
is
what
frederick
siegert
did.
that
is
what
he
was
bent
on
doing.
that
is
what
he
wanted
to
do
premeditatively.
and
unfortunately
for
frederick
siegert,
that
is
what
he
succeeded
at
doing.
ms.
nina
kraut
i
think
that
if
frederick
siegert
were
a
public
figure,
he
would
be
able
to
bring
a
claim
of
this
sort,
because
actual
malice
would
be
shown.
and
by
the
substantive
and
the
facts
that
we
did
allege
in
this
case,
we
do
think
that
we
do
meet
an
actual
malice
standard,
your
honor.
frederick
siegert
did
state
a...
a
compensable
injury
as
i
said,
stigma
plus,
to
a
protected
liberty
interest,
the
right
to
pursue
one's
calling
without
the
malicious
interference
of
the
government.
and
as
stated
in...
or...
and
held
in
paul
v.
davis,
in
meyer,
in
doe,
in
bartel,
in
white
v.
nicholls
and
a
few
other
cases,
the
right
that
was
violated
was
so
well
established
in
october
of
1985
that
no
reasonable
public
official
in
gilley's
position
could
possibly
not
have
known
that
what
he
was
doing
was
wrong.
ms.
nina
kraut
well,
we
think
it
does,
your
honor.
it's
closely
connected
to
it.
the
merits
of
the
case
and
whether
or
not
the
allegations...
the
factual
allegations
that
siegert
alleged
below
was
hotly
and
vigorously
contested
by
the
government
below.
it
was
decided
by
the
court
below
in
fact
that
the
factual
allegations
were
insufficient
to
meet
that
heightened
pleading
standard.
and
we
think
that,
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
that
it
is
within
the
general
parameters
of
the
question
that
was
actually
presented.
so
we
think
there
is
a
very
close
connection
to
it,
and
we
do
ask
the
court
to
answer
that.
i
believe
it
was
also...
that's
as
far
as
the
substantive
claim
is
concerned.
we
do
think
that
it
is
closely
connected
and
it
ought
to
be
addressed.
in
fact
the
government
hotly
contested
it
in
its
briefs
to
this
court.
and
given
that
it
did...
given
that
i
contested
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
we
think
that
it
is
right
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
in
fact,
even
if
the
discovery
rule
is
upheld
by
this
court,
whether
or
not
siegert's
allegations
satisfied
that
standard.
and
of
course,
we
think
they
did
for
many
reasons.
ms.
nina
kraut
i
will,
your
honor.
but
if
i
could...
if
the
court
would
like
me
to
address
that
right
now,
i'll
be
happy
to.
but
what
i
would
like
to
do
is...
is
essentially
state
what
the
factuall
allegations
were
so
that
when
the
court
looks
at
those
factual
allegations
in
relation
to
the
discovery
rule
that's
being
challenged,
i
think
it
will
be
a
slightly
more
complete
picture.
what
siegert
alleged
were
the
following.
he
alleged
that
he
had
had
exemplary
job
performance
ratings
for
his
entire
time
at
saint
elizabeths.
he
alleged
that
he
had
been
hired
because
of
his
expertise
in
the
treating...
in
treating
mentally
retarded
people,
severely
mentally
retarded
people.
he
alleged
that
he
was
the
coordinator
of
the
behavior
modification
treatment
unit
for
the...
almost
the
entire
time
that
he
was
employed
by
saint
elizabeths.
he
alleged
that
he
trained
others
in
the
area
of
behavior
modification
treatment.
he
alleged
that
his
ethics
had
never
before
been
questioned.
he
alleged
that
he
had
signed
a
3-year
contract
with
the
army
when
he
wanted
to
be
transferred,
and
one
can
assume
from
that
that
the
army
made
some
inquiry
into
his
background
and
knew
that
he
was
an
ethical...
an
expert
in
his
field.
he
alleged
that
there
had
been
longstanding
professional
and
personal
conflicts
with
gilley.
he
alleged
that
gilley
knew
almost
nothing
about
behavior
modification,
and
he
alleged
that
he
and
others
on
the
behavior
modification
treatment
unit
resisted
gilley's
attempts
in
that
first
month
to
change
certain
aspects
of
the
behavior
modification
treatment
program.
ms.
nina
kraut
your
honor,
he...
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
if
the
court
wants
it
off
the
record,
dr.
siegert
is
employed
in
a
private
hmo
plan...
sort
of
a...
i
don't
know
exactly
what
they
are...
but
it's
an
hmo
private
institution.
he
is
not
treating
mentally
retarded
people.
he
is--
ms.
nina
kraut
--he
is
engaged
in
clinical
psychology.
however,
your
honor,
because
of
his
training
and
because
of
the
area
of
expertise
in
which
he
practiced,
not
only
at
saint
elizabeths
but
as
he
alleged
also
at
forrest
haven
and
other
institutions,
totally
and
only
in
the
area
of
treating
the
most
severely
retarded
people
you
can
imagine...
that
is
his
expertise.
it's
as
though
someone
told
me
that
i
couldn't
practice
the
kind
of
law
i
practice
and
i
would
have
to
practice
tax
law,
and
all
apologies
to
any
tax
lawyers
in
the
room.
ms.
nina
kraut
well,
i
think
that...
my
sympathy,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
i...
i
guess
it
didn't
hurt
you
though.
i
think
that
if,
if
a
person
wants
to
practice
a
certain
area
of
law,
or
a
person
wants
to
practice
as
an...
and
is
trained
in
practicing
a
particular
type
of
medicine
or
psychology
or
whatever,
they
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it.
mr....
dr.
siegert
cannot
practice
his
profession
anymore,
because
the
only
place
that
he
can
practice
it
is
in
public
institutions,
and
because
of
what
happened
to
him
as
a
result
of
gilley's
actions,
he
is
no
longer
able
to
be
hired
by
institutions,
because,
as
the
stuttgart
personnel
said
when
he
went
there
to
try
to
work,
because
of
what
we've
heard
about
you.
and
it
is...
that
is
a
liberty
interest
that
is...
that
has
been
cut
off
by
gilley,
and
as
i
said,
we
think
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
seek
compensation.
ms.
nina
kraut
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
procedural
case,
and
there
is
no
process
that
can
clear
his
name.
let...
let
me
say
that--
ms.
nina
kraut
--well,
hearn,
your
honor,
i
think
hearn
v.
the
city
of
gainesville,
which
i
cited.
it's
an
eleventh
circuit
case.
i
think
that
in
combination
with
meyer
v.
nebraska,
with
paul
v.
davis.
there's
no
one--
ms.
nina
kraut
--well,
it
is,
your
honor,
but
in
terms
of
substantive,
i
think
that
if
i
could
use
justice
souter's
case
in
new
hampshire
that
he
decided
in
1988,
richardson--
ms.
nina
kraut
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
nina
kraut
--your
honor,
i...
that's
true,
but
in
richardson...
in
the
richardson
case,
your
honor
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
that
case
could
have
been
a
substantive
due
process
claim
and
referred
specifically
to
meyer
v.
nebraska
and
to
schware
as
establishing
that
substantive
due
process...
that
substantive
due
process
claim.
now--
ms.
nina
kraut
--i
have
it
right
here,
your
honor.
[laughter]
in...
but
what
the
court
did
in
new
hampshire,
what
justice
souter
did
in
new
hampshire,
was
say,
no,
this
is
a
procedural
case,
because,
number
one,
there
was
a
process
that
was
in
place.
and
secondly,
the
state...
the
state
of
new
hampshire
apparently
acknowledged
that
they
had
violated
their
own
procedure.
and
thirdly,
my
recollection
is
that
this
fellow
may
have
already
been...
have
already
made
his
admission
that
he
had...
i
think
already
said
that
he
had
done
what
the
state
that
he
did.
and
fourthly,
i
don't
think
a
substantive
due
process
claim
was
ever
raised
in
that
case,
directly
or
indirectly
from
what
i
can
gather.
but
i
think
it's...
coming
back...
i
think
the
fact
that
justice
souter
in
that
case
did
refer
to
nebraska
and
to
schware
is
an
indication
that,
given
that
the
factual
circumstances
in
the
two
case
are
so
similar
that
at
least
it...
what
it
does
is
provide
very
strong
guidance
that
in
fact
meyer
and
schware
can
stand
for
the
liberty
interest
and
the
compensable
injuries
that
are
at
stake
here
and--
ms.
nina
kraut
--your
honor,
i
think
that
i...
what...
what
i
think
has
to
be
looked
at
here
is...
first
of
all,
richards...
anderson
states,
i
think
quite
explicitly,
that
the
precise
character
of
the
right
does
not
have
to
be
set
forth
in
precision.
secondly,
this
kind
of
case
is
comparable
to,
for
example,
a...
an
eighth
amendment
claim
of
deliberate
indifference
in
a
prison
setting
for
medical
treatment
for
prisoners.
that
is
a...
and
entirely
a
tort
action
of
medical
malpractice
but
with
an
unconstitutional
motive
attached.
and
that
turns
it
from
a
tort
claim
into
a
constitutional
claim.
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
the
battery...
the
tort
of
battery
is
turned
into
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
because
again,
because
of
a...
an
unconstitutional
motive.
ms.
nina
kraut
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
a
trial
court
may
then
order
discovery
prior
to
disposition
on
a
summary
judgment
motion
to
determine
if
there
are
material
issues
generally
in
dispute
on
matters
concerning
qualified
immunity.
that
is
in
fact
what
we
think
that
anderson
and
harlow
and
mitchell
already
imply.
we
think
that
that
rule
is
consistent
with
article
iii.
what
the--
ms.
nina
kraut
--this
rule
is...
we
think
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
take
all
of
our
allegations,
which
i
began
to
read
but
haven't
finished...
all
of
those
allegations
he
applied...
judge
sporkin
applied
the
heightened
pleading
standard,
not
this
standard.
he
applied
the
circuit
court's
heightened
pleading
standard
as
he
was
bound
to
do,
and
he
made
a
determination
that
on
the
issues
of
falsity
and
on
the
issues
of
malice
that
there
were
material
facts...
that
those
are
material
facts
and
that
they
were
genuinely
in
dispute
and
that
the
allegations
of
malice
and
falsity
were
so
sufficient
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that,
if
this
case
went
to
trial,
that
they
would
be
able
to
find
for
dr.
siegert.
ms.
nina
kraut
he
allowed...
and
what
he
ordered
in
fact
was
discovery
on
two
issues,
and
i
think
it's
at
page
52
or
54a
of
the
appendix...
he
specifically
ordered
limited
discovery
on
the
issues
of
falseness
and
malice
when
he
ordered
the
depositions
of
siegert,
of
gilley,
and
of
colonel
smith.
i
believe
that
he
also
ordered
in
his
first
order
of
december
of
1987,
i
believe
it
was,
he
also
ordered
i
think
some
production
of
some
documents.
ms.
nina
kraut
no,
that--
ms.
nina
kraut
--what
he
did
conformed
to
the
present
standard
that
now
exists
to
this
heightened
pleading
standard.
ms.
nina
kraut
well,
absolutely,
if
it...
if
it
conformed
to
their--
ms.
nina
kraut
--absolutely
it
conformed
to
our
standard
if
it
conformed
to
a
higher
standard.
this
standard
is
not--
ms.
nina
kraut
--no.
no,
no,
no.
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
now
imposes
two
things.
number
one,
it
imposes
a
direct
evidence...
allegations
of
direct
evidence.
he...
i
don't
know
frankly
whether
judge
sporkin
made
a
determination
whether
direct
evidence
had
been
alleged,
but
in
any
event
the
government
has
conceded
that
that
particular
aspect
of
the
court's
rule
should
not...
should
not
be
upheld,
because
it
has
absolutely
no
legal
foundation.
it
conflicts
with
holland.
it
conflicts
with
just
a
whole
host
of
cases
that
circumstantial
evidence
is
not
as
good
as
direct
evidence.
the
second
prong,
however,
of
the
district
court's
heightened
pleading's
standard
is
that
prior
to
discovery
a
bivens
plaintiff
has
to
allege
specific
facts
in
conformity
with
a
post-discovery
standard,
specific
facts
showing
that
in
fact
there
are
material
facts
in
dispute
and
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
for
the
nonmoving
party.
ms.
nina
kraut
he
went
further,
because...
he
went
further
in
terms
of
the
findings
that
he
made.
he
found
that
siegert
had
alleged
sufficient
facts
to
conform
with
the
heightened
pleading
standard.
now,
the
district
court's
rule
means
that
if
you
meet
that
standard,
then
you
can
have
discovery.
and
that
in
fact...
that
is
in
fact
what
judge
sporkin
did.
he
ordered
discovery
in
conformity
with
the
fact
that
siegert
met
the
heightened
pleading
standard.
ms.
nina
kraut
this
rule
i--
ms.
nina
kraut
--uh,
no,
it
is
a
lesser...
less
rigorous
standard,
and
it
is
less
rigorous,
your
honor,
because
it
is
a
pre-discovery
standard.
ms.
nina
kraut
the
district
judge's
standard
that
was
applied,
that
was
actually
applied
in
this
case
was
more
rigorous
than
the
one
that
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor.
the--
ms.
nina
kraut
--yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
said,
number
one,
that
we
had
failed
to
allege
direct
evidence
of
malice,
and
secondly,
even
if
we...
and
secondly,
that
whatever
we
did
allege
were
too
conclusory.
they
said
that
the...
the
panel
said
that
the
allegations
were
too
conclusory
to
comport
with
the
heightened
pleading
standard.
ms.
nina
kraut
and
therefore,
they
found
that
we
had
not
met
the
heightened
pleading
standard
and
we
were
basically
out
of
court.
the
rule
that
we
do
propose,
as
i
said,
is
consistent
with
what
trial
judges
are
supposed
to
do
under
article
iii.
they
have
discretion...
they
ought
to
have
discretion
to
try
cases.
and
they
are
in
the
best
position,
in
fact,
to
make
determinations,
because
they
are
right
there
on
the
front
lines
of
litigation
with
us.
they
can
see.
they
can
hear.
they're
eye
ball
to
eye
ball
with
us.
ms.
nina
kraut
but
they...
what
they
do
need
to
do
is
make
some
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not
a
suit
is
frivolous.
after
all,
that's
what
harlow
was
supposed
to
guard
against.
and
they
are
bound
to
keep
out
of
court
or
to
let
suits
progress
beyond
a
certain
very
early
point
if
those
suits
in
fact
are
frivolous.
ms.
nina
kraut
yes,
your
honor,
there
has
to
be
a
judgment
factor.
ms.
nina
kraut
no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying...
let
me
restate
the
rule
just...
let
me
clarify
it
for
you.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
have
malice
attached
to
a
claim
of
otherwise
unlawful
conduct,
there
have
to
be
something
beyond
or
above
or
more,
more
rigorous
than
a...
just
a
general
allegation
of
malice.
ms.
nina
kraut
we
don't
think
that
the...
that
this
rule
is
a
heightened
pleading
standard
in
the
same
way
that
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
is.
ms.
nina
kraut
it's
a
lower
heightened
pleading.
that's
right.
that's
exactly
right.
i
think
that--
ms.
nina
kraut
--your
honor--
ms.
nina
kraut
--your
honor,
because...
because
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
calls
for
what
they
call
direct
evidence
as
well
as...
which
we
think
has
absolutely
no
merit
at
all,
as
the
government
agrees.
and
secondly,
they're
calling
for
nonconclusory
allegations.
now,
it
could
be
that
a
judge
in
viewing
these
pleadings
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
a
plaintiff
may
in
fact
determine
that
even
if
there
are
conclusory
allegations
that
constitute
malice,
nevertheless
the
case
as
the...
or
the
allegations
as
a
whole
have
some
plausibility
that
there
is
some
demonstration
that
the
plaintiff's
claim
has
some
merit.
and
so...
we're
talking
about
lawful
conduct...
there
is,
we
think,
some
necessity,
given
the
policy
considerations
of...
of
qualified
immunity
that
a
plaintiff
ought
to
come
in
with
something
more
than
a
general
statement
of
malice.
ms.
nina
kraut
i
think
that,
given
the
qualified
immunity
policy
considerations,
your
honor,
i
think
that
after
a
complaint
is
filed...
and
i'm
not...
i
think--
ms.
nina
kraut
--the
answer
is
yes,
after
a
complaint
has
been
filed
and
where
unlawful...
and
where
lawful
conduct
has
been
alleged.
if
already--
ms.
nina
kraut
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
although
i've
certainly
read
cases
that
get
thrown
out
at
the
complaint
stage
because
allegations...
for
example,
i
remember
one
case
that
dealt
with
deliberate
indifference
in
the
medical
field
for
prisoners
where
the
plaintiff
was
given
two
or
three
bites
of
the
apple
and
said--
ms.
nina
kraut
--only
for
complaints
which
come
in...
where
there
is
unlawful
conduct
alleged...
already
unlawful
conduct
alleged
and
malice
is
a
part
of
that.
then
i
think
that...
that
the
general
allegation
of
malice
is
acceptable.
your
honor,
i
have
about
3
minutes
left,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
nina
kraut
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
let
me
just
say
that
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
comment
if
depositions
has
been
taken,
we
would
have
been
out
of
court.
no,
we
would
have
gone
to
trial,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
nina
kraut
xxx
he's
right
about
that.
ms.
nina
kraut
--all
right,
your
honor.
second...
let
me
just
say...
make
a
quick
comment
about
the
fact
that
the
government
insists
that
this
is
a
reference
in
terms
of
our
second
question
presented.
the
act
that
gilley
was
asked
to
take
was
a
ministerial
act.
and
i
say
that
because
the
term
"job
performance"...
all...
what
the
credential
information
request
form
asked
for
was
all
information
on
job
performance
and
credential
information.
the
word
or
the
term
"job
performance",
as
i
noted
in
our
brief,
is
a
bureaucratic
term
of
art.
it
is
recognized
as
such
in
5
u.s.c.
4301
to
4315.
justice
scalia
referred
to
it
enumerable
times
as
job
performance
in
discussing
the
issues
that
arose
in
fausto,
and
gilley
himself
was
a
bureaucrat
at
the
very
least
at
saint
elizabeths
for
something
like
13
or
14
years.
and
any
reasonable
official
looking
at
that
form
would
have
known
that
job
performance
meant
job
performance
ratings,
discreet
information
that
were...
that
was
actually
in
siegert's
file--
ms.
nina
kraut
--absolutely.
and
the
other
thing
that
should
be
looked
at
is
that
because
the
form
asked
for
all
job
performance
and
credential
information,
another
very
good
indication
of
malice
is--
ms.
nina
kraut
--your
honor,
i
think
that
in
our
material
facts
in
issue
we
stated
that
gilley
was
a
nonpolicy-making
supervisor.
and
then
in
our
opposition
papers
at
pages
7
and
8,
we
said
something
along
the
lines
of
this
was
a
ministerial
function.
so,
yes,
we
did.
ms.
nina
kraut
we're
talking
about
knowledge
of
falsity,
deliberate...
false...
the
knowledge
that
the
information--
ms.
nina
kraut
--i
think
they're
talking
about
the
same
thing,
your
honor,
and
if
you
look
at
white--
ms.
nina
kraut
--if
you
look
at
white
v.
nicholls,
a
case
that
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
5,
there's
a
very
interesting
discussion
there
about
what
constitutes
motive,
what
kind
of
information
must
be
presented
to
show
malice.
and
what
they
talk
about
is
falsity
plus
probable
cause
equal
malice.
that's
what
existed
in
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
nina
kraut
because--
ms.
nina
kraut
--well,
because
if
you
look...
you
can't
just
look
at
one
thing.
you
have
to
look
at
everything...
everything
other
indicia
of
siegert's
job
performance
at
saint
elizabeths
was
exemplary.
and
that
in
fact
indicates
that
gilley
knew
or
should
have
known
that
in
fact--
