justice
souter
i'm
not
sure
you'd
better
do
that.
[laughter]
justice
souter
because
that
was
a
procedural
due
process
case.
justice
souter
i'd
better
go
back
and
give
that
one
a
second
thought.
justice
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
the
point
though
that
those
cases,
just
as
you
just
said,
identify
the
interest
which
is
subject
to
protection,
but
they
don't
define
the
manner
in
which
the
interest
will
be
protected.
and
what
the
later
cases
hold
and
in
what
that
case
of
mine
that
you
referred
to
happen
to
hold,
was
that
there
are
certain
procedural
due
process
protections,
but
none
of
them
are
substantive
due
process
cases
in
the
sense
of
providing
an
absolutely
protection,
let's
say,
in
the
richardson
case
against
libel
as
such.
that
was
not
thought
to
be
the
function
of
1983
or
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
souter
mr.
lazerwitz,
may
i
go
back
just
to
clarify
something.
i
go
back
to
one
of
the
chief
justice's
earlier
questions.
if
the
original
complaint
simply
alleged
malice
in
general
terms,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
claim
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
for
that
purpose
alone.
let's
assume
complaint
is
filed,
no
immunity,
nothing,
just
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
you
don't,
as
i
understand
it,
take
the
position
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
dismissal
at
that
point.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
all
right.
so
it's
only
when
the
next
stage
arrives...
i.e.,
an
immunity
defense
is
raised
or
otherwise
summary
judgment
is
raised
somehow
implicating
the
issue
of
malice...
it's
only
at
that
point
that
you
say
the
pleadings
have
got
to...
in
effect
have
got
to
be
supplemented
by
some
more
specific
fact
pleading
before
discovery
would
be
justified.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
no,
but
it
doesn't...
in
justice
steven's
hypo,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
doesn't
mean
anything,
because
the
reason
for
the
immunity
at
the
stage
we're
talking
about
is
to
prevent
the
litigation,
not
merely
recovery,
but
to
prevent
litigation.
and
on
his
hypothetical,
the
litigation
is
going
to
go
on,
because
you're
going
to
have
discovery
on
the
defamation
claim
anyway.
so
the
whole
policy
of
applying
the
immunity
doctrine
at
that
point
would
be
negated
by
your
other
cause
of
action.
