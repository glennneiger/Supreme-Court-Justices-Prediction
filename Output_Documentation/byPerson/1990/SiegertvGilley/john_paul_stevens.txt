justice
stevens
may
i
ask
right
at
this
point,
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
clearly
established
claim
before,
as
i
remember
the
government's
position
is
that
the
procedural
due
process
claim
was
clearly
established,
but
that
the
record
indicates
he
did
have
a
fair
opportunity
for
a
name-clearing
hearing,
which
is
all
the
constitution
guarantees.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stevens
and
it
is
clear
that...
is
it
clear
that
if
it's
not
a
procedural
case,
that
there
was
a
clearly
established
nonprocedural
right?
and
if
so,
what
case
established
it.
justice
stevens
well,
paul
against
davis
is
procedural.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
perhaps
i'm
missing
something
fairly
fundamental
here.
but
the
universe
of
case
that
we're
dealing
with,
are
those
in
which
malice
is
an
element
of
the
constitutional
claim,
not
just
comes
in
as
negating
a
defense
of
qualified
immunity.
i'd
like
to
know
what
sort
of
cases
are
we
talking
about?
are
there
any
such
cases?
you
deny,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
such
a
clearly
established
claim
at
the
time
this
occurred.
and
you
assumed
for
purpose
of
argument
that
there
now
is
such
a
claim.
but
is
there
anything
else
other
than
a
defamation
claim
that
you
would
say
fits
in
this
category?
justice
stevens
well,
where
you've
got
the
riot
situation
in
prison.
justice
stevens
that
would
be
the
one.
justice
stevens
well,
that
doesn't
require
malice,
so
that's
less
than
malice.
justice
stevens
any
kind
of
subjective
motivation.
justice
stevens
and
in
any
case
like
say
a
prison
riot
case,
the
prisoner
who
claims
that
there,
you
know,
that
there
was
this
extreme
subjective
motivation,
it
would
have
to
have
direct
evidence
of
the--
justice
stevens
--not
direct,
but
hearsay
or
direct
evidence.
justice
stevens
i
don't
see
why
the
case
would
be
different
if
he
could
prove...
he
had
the
actual
records
that
he
gave
everybody
else
an
a
rating
and
he
gave
this
fellow
an
f.
maybe
he
thinks
this
is...
he's
a
lousy
worker.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
in
this
case
there
was
an
alternative
common
law
count
for
defamation
as
well,
which
i
gather
there's
no
federal
jurisdiction,
as
that's
with...
that's
why
the
whole
case
is
dismissed.
but
assume
there
was
an
independent
base...
say,
there
was
a
diversity
as
well
as
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
discovery
then
would
proceed
on
the
malice
aspects
of
the
defamation
claim.
could
the
results
of
that
discovery
be
used
by
the
plaintiff
to
defeat
the
qualified
immunity
claim
or
are
you
entitled
to
an
initial
dismissal
of
that?
justice
stevens
why
is
it
implausible?
i...
if
there
had
been
jurisdiction,
they
surely
would
have
taken
discovery
to
support
the
definition...
defamation
claim,
and
it
might
well
have
revealed
the
facts
that
they're
now
being
denied
access
to
it.
justice
stevens
even
though
the
record
after...
after
the
issue
is
raised
develops
sufficient
factual
material
to
show--
justice
stevens
--that
if
the
defense
should
fail?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no.
but
this...
these
are
facts
which
would
show
that
you're
not
entitled
to
the
immunity,
not
that
you've
committed
a
constitutional
wrong.
justice
stevens
you'd
still
say
you
can't
look
at
those
facts?
justice
stevens
mr.
lazerwitz,
i
have
to
take
issue
with
your
statement
that
on
a
hypothetical
i
give
you
the
defendant
has
a
right
not
to
be
sued.
the
only
thing
he
has...
he
doesn't
have
such
right
if
the
facts
are
as
i
described
them.
he
just
has
a
rule
of
law
that
prevents
the
plaintiff
from
getting
access
to
the
facts
that
would
show
he
had
no
right
to
the
immunity.
he
has
no
right
not
to
be
sued
if
the
facts
are
as
i
describe
them.
it's
just
that
he
couldn't
prove
them
at
the
particular
point
in
the
procedural
development
of
the
case
that
you
say
is
essential.
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
they'd
taken
a
deposition
right
away,
it
probably
would
have
been.
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
you're
right
on
that
contention,
the
mere
writing
of
the
letter
is
enough
to
prove
malice.
justice
stevens
did
you
argue
to
the
district
court
that
this
is
sufficient
to
prove
malice
because
job
performance
has
this
limited
reading?
