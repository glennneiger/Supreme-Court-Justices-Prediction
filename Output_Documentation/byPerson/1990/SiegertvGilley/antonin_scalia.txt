justice
scalia
i
guess
all
that's
not
true
if
you're
a
public
figure
however?
justice
scalia
what...
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
that?
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
that
there
had
been
factual
allegations
that
support
malice?
justice
scalia
and
what--
justice
scalia
how
do
you...
how
do
you
ever
stop
a
suit
from
proceeding
beyond
the
summary
judgment
stage
if
there
is
an
intent
element,
and
if
we
follow
your
rule
that
there's
no
heightened
pleading
standard,
that
all
the...
that
all
the
plaintiff
has
to
come
in
and
say
is,
this
was
done
with
malice.
justice
scalia
so
you
agree
with
the
d.c.
circuit's
standard?
justice
scalia
it's
a
lower
heightened
pleading.
justice
scalia
but
i
thought
your
objection
in
principle
is
to
a
heightened
pleading
standard?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--once,
once
you
abandon
what
the
rules
says,
it
seems
to
me
why
should
i
prefer
yours
to
theirs?
justice
scalia
so
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
inapplicable,
or
not
inapplicable,
but
there's
a
stricter
standard
than
is
required
in
rule
9(b)?
justice
scalia
except
that
then
you
come
up
with
another
problem
in
the
rules.
if
it's
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
you
have
to
had
allowed
adequate
cross...
adequate
discovery.
but
you
don't
have
to
at
the
pleading
stage.
justice
scalia
so
you're
sort
of...
you
have
a...
one
leg
in
each
of
two
boats--
justice
scalia
--and
they're
going
in
different
directions.
justice
scalia
so
that's
really
all
you're
arguing
for.
does
that
given
you
a
whole
lot,
just
to
throw
you
back
to
rule
56(f)?
justice
scalia
and
that's
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
case,
that
it
didn't
get
to
the
56(f)
stage?
justice
scalia
gee.
justice
scalia
we're
not
arguing
about
a
whole
lot
then,
really,
here
are
we?
justice
scalia
all
this
plaintiff
had
to
do
was
to
come
in
and
say,
hey,
how
can
i
possibly
prove
malice
unless
i
get
some
discovery.
justice
scalia
i
think...
that's
the
mistake
here.
she
didn't
say
that.
and
if
she'd
said
that,
the
judge
would
say,
you're
right.
of
course
you
can't
prove
it
without
some
discovery;
here,
have
discovery.
that's
what
we're
arguing
about
today?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--why...
why
does...
why
does
knowledge
that
job
performance
has
this
technical
meaning,
why
does
that
prove
malice?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
why...
i
thought...
i
know
it
has
its
technical
meaning,
but
this
guy
is
really
bad
and
i
really
think
he's
really
bad,
and
in
addition
to
this
job
performance
information,
they
ought
to
know
that.
why
does
it
prove
malice?
i
don't
see
that.
