justice
o'connor
and
you
don't
take
the
position
that
it
has
to
be
in
the
complaint?
justice
o'connor
it
can
be
dealt
with
as
a
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
o'connor
with
affidavits
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lazerwitz,
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
some
circumstances,
some
limited
discovery
can
be
had
by
the
plaintiff
to
deal
with
this
question
of
malice?
justice
o'connor
well,
here
in
this
case,
the
district
court
said
the
plaintiff
could
depose
the
defendant.
now,
was
that
a
permissible
order
in
discovery?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
agree,
do
you,
with
the
cadc's
holding
that
there
has
to
be
direct
evidence
of
malice?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
we
read
it
that
way,
is
that
something
you
agree
with
or
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
about
a
deliberate
indifference
allegation?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
were
dismissed
and
there
were
subsequently
motions
by
the
defendant
for
rule
11
sanctions,
would
discovery
then
be
allowed
that
you
say
wouldn't
be
allowed
on
the
merits?
