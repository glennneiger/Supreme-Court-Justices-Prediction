justice
kennedy
is
the
answer
yes?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
it's
always
after
a
complaint
is
filed
that
we
judge
whether
or
not
it's
sufficient.
justice
kennedy
so
you
don't
rely
on
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
9(b)?
justice
kennedy
getting
back
for
a
moment
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
would
this
complaint,
under
your
theory,
subject
the
plaintiff's
counsel
to
sanctions
under
rule
11
on
the
ground
that
the
allegation
is
not
well
grounded
in
fact?
justice
kennedy
so
it
is
well
grounded
in
fact
and
yet
it
can't
proceed?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
under
your
theory,
she
can't
even,
even
proceed,
then
why
can't
you
say
that
it's
not
well
grounded
in
fact?
justice
kennedy
well,
your...
your
position
is
that
at
this
point
it
must
be
dismissed.
