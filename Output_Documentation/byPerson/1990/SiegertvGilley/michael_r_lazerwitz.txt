mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
harlow
against
fitzgerald
this
court
held
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
bivens
action
cannot
overcome
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity,
and
therefore,
proceed
with
the
litigation
by
alleging
that
the
official
acted
with
malice.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
plaintiff
may
do
so
where
malice
or
improper
motive
happens
to
be
an
element
of
the
constitutional
claim.
in
our
view
in
the
face
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
general
allegations
of
malice
do
not
entitle
the
plaintiff
to
proceed.
where
malice
or
improper
motive
is
an
element
of
the
constitutional
claim,
the
plaintiff,
in
order
to
avoid
dismissal,
must
allege
specific
facts
that
call
into
question
the
objective
reasonableness
of
the
official's
challenged
conduct.
this
requirement
which
may
be...
this
so-called
particularity
requirement,
which
stems
from
the
court's
recent
immunity
decisions
in
harlow,
mitchell
against
forsyth,
and
anderson
against
creighton,
ensures
that
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity
in
these
particular
lawsuits
retains
its
substantive
scope
and
effect.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
strict
terms
it
really
isn't.
the...
calling
it
a
pleading
requirement
i
think
has
caused
more
confusion
than
is
necessary,
because
under
the
federal
rules,
a
plaintiff
can...
under
rule
8
and
rule
9,
a
plaintiff
can
file
a
rather
barebones
complaint
and
can
allege...
and
we
don't
challenge
this...
can
allege
malice
in
general
terms.
but
the
landscape
changes
once
the
federal
official,
if
he
so
chooses,
raises
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity.
and
that...
that
changes,
in
our...
in
our
view,
how
this
is
resolved.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
because
both...
excuse
me...
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
should
have
and
actually
did
consider
matters
that
were
not
in
the
complaint,
it
becomes
a
summary
judgment
case.
and
therefore,
to
say
that...
and
some
courts
have
suggested
this
but
not
really
held
it,
that
all
this
has
to
be
in
the
complaint
is
i
think
misleading.
although,
for
practical
purposes--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
for
all
practical
purposes--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
if
the
plaintiff
has
this
information,
it
would
be...
it
probably
would
behoove
the
plaintiff
to
put
it
in
the
complaint,
but
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
to,
because
as
this
court
held
in
gomez,
the
qualified
immunity
of
defense
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
has
to
be
pleaded
by
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
this
is...
this
is
actually
a
fairly
representative
case
and...
except
for
the
colloquy
before
about
the
claim.
and
i'll
leave
that
aside
for
the
moment.
the
plaintiff
files
a
complaint,
alleges
that
the
federal
official
violated
my
rights.
the
defendant
here
files
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
in
the
alternative
for
summary
judgment,
saying
my
qualified
immunity
defense...
i
win.
now,
the
plaintiff
has
to
come
up
with
something
more
to
go
forward.
or,
of
course,
the
plaintiff
can
rest
on
his
complaint.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
most
narrow
context,
the
fight
here
is
over
the
right
to
obtain
additional
discovery.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
complaint
that
the
plaintiff
alleges
it
follows
rule
9(b)
and
alleges
malice...
avers
malice
generally.
once
the
defendant
has
invoked
his
substantive
protection
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense
and
moved
for
dismissal,
the
plaintiff
cannot
rest
simply
on
the
complaint,
because--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
we're
not,
justice
blackmun,
and
this...
the
problem
is
in
a
sense
created
by
bivens
and
harlow.
in
bivens
the
court
held
that
there...
recognized
the
remedy
to...
excuse
me...
a
cause
of
action
to
remedy
the
vindication
of
certain
constitutional
rights.
harlow,
years
later,
recognized
there's
a
problem
if
a
plaintiff
can
just
walk
into
court
and
allege
improper
motive
and
then
you
have
discovery
and
a
trial,
that
was
unacceptable.
but
the
court
didn't
tackle
in
harlow,
and
what
the
lower
courts
have
been
tackling
in
the
meantime,
is
the
problem
presented
here.
what
happens
when
the
plaintiff
doesn't
allege
malice
in
order
to
defeat
the
immunity,
but
has
to
allege
malice
because
that's
part
of
the
constitutional
cause
of
action?
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
oh,
yes,
there's...
there's...
i
believe
the
petitioner
is
overstating
or
misstating
both
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
here...
and
neither
are
we.
we're
not
applying
a
post-discovery
standard,
pre-discovery.
that's
not
what's
going
on
here.
instead...
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
not
at
least...
not
on
the
showing
the
plaintiff
made.
other...
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
problem
here
is,
notwithstanding
the
different
facts
that
plaintiff
alleges,
it's
essentially
conclusory.
dr.
gilley...
excuse
me...
dr.
gilley
didn't
like
me,
so
he
must
have
written
this
recommendation
letter
with
malice.
the
problem
is
there's
nothing
to
support
that.
it's
just...
it's
simply
conclusory,
unsupported.
but
here
would
be
an
example
of
a
plaintiff
that
probably
would
be
able
to
get
the
limited
discovery.
plaintiff
alleges,
i
heard
from
my
co-worker,
mr.
jones,
that
dr.
gilley
is
out
to
get
me
and
is
going
to
do
bad
things
to
me.
but
i
can't
get
dr....
mr.
jones'
affidavit.
he
won't
give
it
to
me.
now,
in
that
particular
case,
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
defeat
summary
judgment,
because
that's...
that
would
be
hearsay.
but
it's
our
position
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
district
judge
would
certainly
be
well
within
his
discretion
ordering
limited
discovery.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
read
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
or
opinion
as
requiring
direct
evidence
as
we
understand
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
if
the
court
were
to
read
it
that
way,
no,
we
do
not.
and
we
urge
the
court
not
to
read
it
that
way,
because
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
and
that
question
isn't
necessary
to
the
judgment,
because
on
the
showing
that
petitioner
made
here,
there
just...
it
really
was
just
inference
on
inference,
conclusion
upon
conclusion.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
your
honor,
we...
the
defendant
moved
for
summary
judgment
and/or
dismissal.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
this
particular
case,
technically
speaking,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
motion
to
dismiss
at
this
stage,
because
given
the
way
this
case
was
handled
by
the
lower
courts
and
given
the
submissions
that
petitioner
presented,
it
is
a
summary
judgment
case.
but--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
and
again...
d--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
our...
but
our
position
is
that
given
the
substantive
defense
of
qualified
immunity
that
our...
that
the
approach
adopted
by
the
lower
courts
and
that
we
are
urging
the
court
to
accept
is
perfectly
consistent,
whether
it's
under
rule
12
or
under
rule
56,
because
of
the
problem
that
the
lower
courts
have
identified
as
a
result
of
the
intersection
between
bivens
actions
and
harlow.
because
in...
although
petitioner
didn't
make
this
argument
to
the
court
this
morning,
it's
in
her...
it's
in
the
brief.
as
we
read
the
petitioner's
submission,
if
malice
happens
to
be
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
the
plaintiff
is
automatically
entitled
to
discovery.
and
the
problem
with
that,
in
our
view,
is
that
it's
certainly
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
said
recently
in
anderson
against
creighton,
because
the
immunity
defense
is
not
simply
a
defense
to
personal
liability.
it's
a
defense...
it's
an
entitlement
to
immunity
from
suit.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
the
other
claims
the
court
is...
has
before
it,
the
eighth
amendment
case.
now
some
lower
courts
have
held
that
that
does
have
an--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
other...
the
most
common
i
think
would
be
the
first
amendment
context...
the
whistleblower
type.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
or--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
it's...
it's
not
just
malice.
it's...
these...
the
universe
that
we're
talking
about
here
are
cases
with
malice
or
otherwise
intent.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
so
the
most...
i
guess
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
most
quickly
is
equal...
equal
protection
case.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
again
we
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
way
the
lower
courts
have
treated
this
and
the
way
we
urge
the
court
to
look
at
this,
the
one
thing
you
can't
do
is
walk
into
court
and
say,
he
acted...
he
had
malice
intent.
you
have
to
present
something
more
that
gives
the
court...
the
review...
the
district
court
some
reason
to
question
the
otherwise
objective
reasonableness
of
the
defendant's
conduct.
if,
for
example,
another
case
where
this
would
certainly
come
up
is
a
racial
discrimination
case,
where
the
defendant
has
to
be
charged
with
firing
you
because
you're
black
or
you're
jewish
or
what-not.
now,
the
plaintiff
just
can't
walk
in
and
say,
he
fired
me
because
i'm
jewish.
instead,
he
has
to
present
facts,
specific
facts,
that
would
call
into
question
what
the
defendant
is
implicitly
saying
is,
i
fired
you
because
you're
a
lousy
worker.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
the
defendant
says...
excuse
me...
the
plaintiff
says,
i
received
terrific
ratings
until
dr.
gilley
showed
up.
well,
that
doesn't
say
anything,
because
that
happened
then.
we're
talking
about
now.
what
if
the...
something
that
the
plaintiff
could
have
shown
is
dr.
gilley
gave
everyone
else
on
the
ward
terrific
recommendations
but
not
me.
plaintiff
alleged
here
in
his
affidavit,
it's
my
understanding
that
dr.
gilley
resented
me.
well,
what
is
the
basis
of
that
understanding?
it's
these
types
of
things
that
would
give
the
court,
a
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
something
more
to--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i
think
in
this
particular
case
it's
even
more
acute
because
the...
in
the
recommendation
context,
it's
hard
to
say
that
a
recommendation
is
false.
dr.
gilley
thought
that
the
man
wasn't
a
good
worker.
and
in
this
particular
case
it's
even
more
unusual
in
the
sense
that
the
plaintiff
concedes
he
didn't
show
up
for
work.
he
wasn't
there
for
most
of
the
year
that
dr.
gilley
was
a
supervisor.
now,
yes,
he
alleges
he
wasn't
there
because
he
had
an
injury.
but
he
also
tells
us
that
dr.
gilley
didn't
know
that.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
just
to
clarify
our
position,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
under
the
assumption
that
the
cause
of
action
was
a
defamation...
a
libel
plus
stigma
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
there
cannot
be
a
cause
of
action
without
malice.
there's
no
clearly
established
right--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i
think
in
this
context
it's
knowing
that
it's
false.
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it
is
a...
it's
a
defamation-plus
type
case,
but
again,
i'd
like
to
just
make
sure
the
court
is
clear
on
our
position.
we
do
not
think
that
the
substantive
claim...
the
merits
of
the
substantive
claim
is
before
the
court,
given
the
fact
that
the...
as
we
read
the
questions
presented,
they're
not
part
of
it.
but
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
is
insisting
reach
them,
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that,
because
there
is
no...
this
court
has
never
held
that
there's
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
be
free
from
a
government
official's
defamation.
there's
just
no
such
animal.
and
in
that
case,
the
claim
should
have
been
dismissed
on
that
right.
but--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that...
that's
right,
justice
white,
and
on
the
due
process
component--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
now,
there's
another
grounds
for--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
as
we...
it's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--i
believe
in
this
context
it's
got
to
be...
although
as
i
read
petitioner,
it
might
be
ill
will,
but
it
makes
more
sense
to
me
to
think
of...
he
knew
it
was
false
but
he
lied.
he
received
this
request
and
lied
about
dr.
gilley.
but
i
just
want
to
make
one
more
point
on
the
merits...
underlying
merits.
even
assuming
that
there's
a
protective
liberty
interest,
that
is,
the
defamation-plus
stigma,
on
this
record,
there's
been
no
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
we...
we--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
district
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
district
court--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--we
should
have
won.
this
case
should
have
been
over
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
district
judge
denied
those
claims
and
instead
ordered
this
limited
discovery.
we
then
took
an
appeal
and
raised
these
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
it...
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
position--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
merits,
and
we
disagree
with
that.
there's
no
jurisdictional
bar
for
the
court
to
reach
the
closely
related
question
of
whether--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
they
do
not.
the
question
that
you
granted...
that
the
courts...
that's
presented
in
the
petition
are
two.
one's
the
entitlement
to
discovery...
to
the
so-called
pleading
requirement
and
the
second
is
whether
the
defendant
is
even
entitled
to
the
immunity
defense.
that
wasn't
talked
about
before,
but
let
me
just
address
that
very
quickly.
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
contends
that
respondent
isn't
even
entitled
to
the
immunity
defense,
that's
wrong.
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is
available
when
the
official
acts
and
the
performance
of
so-called
discretionary
as
opposed
to
ministerial
functions.
and
here
respondent's
conduct
is
precisely
the
sort
of
discretionary
decision
making
that
qualified
immunity
protects.
petitioner's
own
credentials
request
letter
asked
for
saint
elizabeths
and
then
dr.
gilley
to
provide
all
information
about
job
performance.
and
what
dr.
gilley
did
here,
providing
that
sort
of
information...
in
essence
a
recommendation
letter...
certainly
entails
judgment,
discretion,
and
what-not.
and
so
we
think
that
on
the
second
question
presented,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
defendant
properly
used
the
qualifying
immunity
defense.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
justice
kennedy,
not
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
it
may
be
well
grounded
in
facts,
but
the
facts
aren't
presented
to
the
court.
and
that's
the
problem.
as
the
case
comes
before
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--because
it
very
well
might
be.
as
the
case
comes
before
the
court,
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
because
that's
the
essence
of
an
immunity
defense,
that
there
aren't
going
to
be
cases.
now,
in
our
view
this
is
not...
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
a...
that
dr.
gilley
did
anything
wrong.
but,
as...
in
a--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that's
a
whole
different
ball
game,
but
i...
again
the
difference
is,
and
what
shouldn't
be
lost
on
the
court,
is
the
qualified
immunity
defense.
that's
what
changes
everything.
because
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
immunity
is,
as
i
mentioned
before...
it's
an
immunity
not
to
be
burdened
by
litigation.
it
is
in
a
sense
an
immunity
not
to
be
subjected
to
discovery.
and
in
this
particular
case,
it
boils
down
to
it's
an
immunity
not
to
be...
have
your
deposition
taken.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it's...
again,
we
concede
it's
a
little
bit
funny
in
the
sense
that
when
you
talk
of
pleadings,
but
the
way
the
qualified
immunity
defense
has
to
work,
if
you're
going
to
have
suits
like
this,
is
the
way
the
lower
courts
have
handled
it.
and
again,
this
is
important.
the...
there
has
been
this
problem
out
there,
and
this...
this
case,
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
this
is
how
every
lower
court
has
been
handling
the
problem.
in
order
to
have...
not
to
eliminate
the
bivens
actions
entirely,
which
certainly
is
not
an
implausible
reading
of
this
court's
decisions,
but
instead
telling
a
plaintiff
you
can
have
your
cause
of
action
in
these
circumstances
but,
given
the
protection
that
the
defendant
must
have
under
this
court's
immunity
decisions,
you're
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
something
a
little
bit--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--under
our...
under
our
position
i
think
your
hypothetical
is
somewhat
implausible.
but
assuming
it
would--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--i
think
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
the...
an
immunity
defense
is
a
defense
to
the
federal
cause
of
action,
and
he's...
and
the
defendant
in
those
circumstances
is
entitled--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--sure.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
sure,
but
that's
a
by-product
of
an
immunity.
i
mean,
immunity
is
raised
by
people
that
might
otherwise
be--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
we...
again--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right.
because
the
immunity
under...
in
the
federal
cause
of
action
has
to
mean...
has
to
mean
something.
if
not,
then
it's
not
an
immunity.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
there...
i
mean,
two
responses.
one
is
and
i'll
repeat
it.
the
federal
defendant
has
a
right
not
to
be...
not
to
be
sued
on
that
cause
of
action.
the
fact
that
he
might
in
the
hypothetical
be
sued
under
a
common
law
cause
of
action
is
essentially
beside
the
point.
and
second,
under
the
westfall
act,
there
wouldn't
be
federal...
there
wouldn't
be
common
law
actions
against
the
individual
defendant.
in
fact,
this
case
shows
that.
while
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals...
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
united
states
filed
a
motion
to
substitute...
excuse
me...
the
united
states
for
the
common
law
actions,
so
that...
that's
all
been
put
on
hold.
but--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
with
respect,
justice
stevens,
i...
we
take
the
position
that
it
means
a
little
bit
more,
that
that
is
in
essence
what
the
immunity
is
all
about,
that
you
have
the
right...
you
have
the
defense
not
to
be
in
court.
and
it's
our
obligation
to
make
sure
that
federal
defendants
use
that...
keep
them
out
of
court
as
quickly
as
possible.
because
as
the
court
has
recognized,
subjecting
federal
officials
to
such
has
some
social
costs:
diverts
their
attention
from
their
job;
it
might
deter
other
people
from
taking
positions.
and
this
particular
case
is
a
perfect
example.
the
case
has
been
going
on
for
almost
5
years.
and
it's...
as
justice
white
mentioned
before,
it
should
have
been
thrown
out
of
court
way
back
when.
and
it's
still
here.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
but
again--
[laughter]
--he
has
the
right
not
to
have
his
deposition
taken.
and
one
concern
that
we
have,
and
not
necessarily
in
this
case,
but
if
you
give
a
little
bit
of
discovery,
the
district
judge
might
say,
oh,
come
on,
you
gave
us
something.
let's
have
a
little
bit
more.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the...
i
differ
with
my
opponent.
judge
sporkin
did
not
say
that
this
is
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
in
a
summary
judgment
context.
he
said
just
the
opposite.
he
said
there
isn't
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
at
all,
but
i
think
i'd
like
to
have
some
clarification.
it's
our
position
that
that
sort
of
clarification,
although
it
might
seems
innocuous
in
any
given
case,
is
precisely
what
the
immunity
defense
is
designed
to
foreclose.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
the
plaintiff
then
has
to
present
some
facts
that
would
tend
to
call
into
question
that
assertion.
and
if
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--if
the
plaintiff
can't
do
that,
then
the
plaintiff
has
to
file
a
rule
56(f)
affidavit,
which
wasn't
filed
in
this
case,
and
show
the
court
why
types
of
facts
the
plaintiff
intends
to
get
that
would
tend
to
undercut
the
immunity.
and
as
i
said
before,
there
are
cases
where
that
will...
can
be
done.
this
isn't
one
of
those
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
not
much.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
we
took
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
fight
that
discovery.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
but
no,
we
are
asking
in
the
question--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--in--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--but
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
that's
what
petitioner
seems
to
say
this
morning.
as
we
understood
it
in
the
briefs,
the
petitioner
was
contesting
this
so-called
standard
to
begin
with.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that's
no
longer
contested,
fine.
but
as
we
understood
the
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
this
case
requires
the
court
to
affirm
that
sort
of
standard
that's
been
going
on...
that's
been
applied
in
the
lower
courts.
and
we
certainly
think
that
that
is
something
worth
fighting
about.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
