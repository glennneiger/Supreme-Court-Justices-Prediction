we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-96,
frederick
a.
siegert
v.
h.
melvyn
gilley.
ms.
kraut.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
kraut,
the
first
question
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
the
extent
of
discovery
which
you
should
be
allowed
where
there's
a
defensive
qualified
immunity.
that
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
your
case
i
would
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
will
eventually
get
to
the
question
presented
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
kraut,
you
have
spent
half
of
your
oral
argument
now
on
a
question
which
you
say
is
subsumed.
you
really
haven't
expliciely
addressed
either
of
the
questions
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
i
suggest
you
do
so.
i'll
be
happy
to
do
that
right
now,
your
honor.
what
the
government
wants,
your
honor,
on
this...
on
this
rule
that
is
actually
presented
is
the
government
wants
to
have
its
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
they
want
a
post-discovery
standard...
what
we
view
anyway
as
a
post-discovery
standard...
applied
to
a
pre-discovery
proceeding
without
letting
the...
the
plaintiff,
a
bivens
plaintiff
or
a
civil
rights
plaintiff,
have
the
benefit
of
any
discovery.
and
we
are
asking
the
court
today
to
state
clearly
that
that
may
not
happen,
and
we
are
proposing
a
rule
to
the
court
that
is,
we
think,
more
consistent
with
what...
what
anderson
and
harlow
state.
it
is
more
consistent
with
what
article
iii
states.
it
is
more
consistent
with
what
the
federal
rules
committees
have
proposed
and
have
amended
in
terms
of
the
rules
of
federal
civil
procedure.
and
that
rule
is...
our
proposed
rule
is
that
prior
to
discovery
and
in
opposition
to
a
summary
judgment
motion
where
qualified
immunity
has
been
raised,
if
malice
has
been
alleged
in
connection
with
otherwise
lawful
conduct,
there
should
be
some
evidentiary
basis
of
malice
which
would
demonstrate
with
some
plausibility
that
a
bivens
plaintiff's
opposition
is
justified
and
that
he
might
defeat
a
qualified
immunity
claim.
where
malice
is
alleged
as
an
element
of
already
established
unlawful
conduct,
malice
may
be
alleged
generally.
once
a
clearly
established
right
has
been
determined
to
exist
in
the
former
by
adequate
allegations
of
malice
and
in
the
latter
by
the
already
established
unlawful
conduct--
--we're
talking
about
pleadings
here?
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
consistent
with
what
the
district
court
did
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
he
would
have
allowed
some
discovery?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
under
your
standard,
he
should
have
ordered
more?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
that
was
all...
that...
what
he
did
conformed
to
your
standard?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
my
question
was
under
your
standard,
the
one
you're
proposing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
absolutely
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
went...
he
went
part
of
the
way
that
your
standard
would
have
required
him
to
go
but
not
as
far?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
my
question,
which
was
whether
the
district
court's
order
in
this
case
went
as
far
as
one...
as
a
district
court
would
go
applying
the
standard
you're
proposing
to
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
does
that...
does
that
comport
with
the
rule
you're
proposing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
district
judge's
standard
applied
here
was
less
rigorous
than
the
one
you
would
apply?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
they're
not...
they're
not...
in
summary
judgment
cases,
they're
not
supposed
to
be
resolving
any
questions
of
fact.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
there
is
a
judgment
factor
there
even
though
they're
not
making
factual
findings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
kraut.
mr.
lazerwitz,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
this
is
a
pleading
requirement,
mr.
lazerwitz?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
how
do
you
see
a
case
like
this
evolving?
the
plaintiff
files
a
complaint.
the
defendant
federal
officer
claims
qualified
immunity
and
moves
for
a
summary
judgment?
is
that
what
happens?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
made
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
you're
on
much
stronger
ground
with
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
rule
9(b)
than
you
are...
a
motion
to
dismiss.
to
say
that
where
rule
9(b)
says
you
can
allege
malice
generally
and
if
you
say
you
can
attack
that
successfully
by
a
motion
to
dismiss,
you're
talking
about
the
pleading
stage.
that
just
does
negate
rule
9(b),
whereas
if
you
rely
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
you're
at
the
next
step
really.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
questions
we
granted
certiorari
on
did
not
deal
with
the
merits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
ms.
kraut,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
sufficiently
answered
the
question,
ms.
kraut.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
next
case
is
no.
90-96,
siegert
against
gilley.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
a
clinical
psychologist,
asked
his
former
employer
who
is
a
federal
hospital
to
provide
job
performance
and
other
information
to
his
new
employer,
a
us
army
hospital
in
west
germany.
the
respondent,
the
petitioner's
supervisor
at
his
former
job,
responded
with
a
letter
declaring
that
he
could
not
recommend
petitioner
because
he
believed
petitioner
to
be
inept,
unethical,
and
untrustworthy.
after
he
was
denied
the
position
at
the
army
hospital,
the
petitioner
sued
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
alleging
that
respondent
had
infringed
his
liberty
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
publishing
the
defamatory
statement
which
he
knew
to
be
untrue.
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
qualified
immunity
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
with
instructions
to
dismiss
because
assuming
that
a
constitutional
violation
had
been
made
out,
the
allegations
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint
were
thought
to
be
insufficient
under
its
heightened
pleading
standard.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
although,
we
do
so
under
a
different
line
of
reasoning.
the
petitioner
based
his
constitutional
claim
on
the
theory
that
respondent's
actions
undertaken
with
malice
deprived
him
of
a
liberty
interest
secured
by
the
fifth
amendment.
in
paul
against
davis,
decided
15
years
ago,
we
held
that
injury
to
reputation
by
itself
was
not
a
liberty
interest
protected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
defamation
by
itself
is
a
tort
actionable
under
the
laws
of
most
states
but
not
a
constitutional
depravation.
the
facts
alleged
by
petitioner
in
this
case
cannot,
in
light
of
our
decision
in
paul
against
davis,
state
a
claim
for
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
and
so,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
directing
dismissal
of
the
plaintiff's
action
but
on
a
different
reasoning
than
the
court
of
appeals
used.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
marshall
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
joins
and
in
parts
2
and
3
of
which
justice
stevens
joins.
