mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
petitioner's
argument
relies
on
what
is
missing
from
the
adea,
respondent
can
point
to
a
bounty
of
evidence
of
congressional
intent
from
the
text
of
the
adea,
its
legislative
history,
the
principles
of
common
sense
and
public
policy
considerations,
all
of
which
overcome
any
so-called
presumption
in
the
federal
common
law
of
administrative
agency
preclusion
applying
to
suits
under
the
adea.
i'd
like
to
use
my
time
before
you
to
enumerate
some
of
those
salient
pieces
of
evidence.
first,
section
14(b)
of
adea
provides
that
in
the
event
a
state
agency
terminates
its
proceedings
sooner
than
in
the
minimum
60-day
period
allotted,
the
grievant
can
still
commence
his
federal
action,
and
in
fact
he
can
do
it
that
much
sooner.
terminated
cases,
that
typically
fall
in
the
category
of
being
quick
open-and-shut
type
cases,
are
obviously
ones
in
which
the
grievant
has
little
or
no
evidence
to
support
his
claims,
and
they
would
be
summarily
rejected
and
terminated.
it
would
be
ironic
indeed
if
congress
intended
to
permit
quick
federal
court
access
for
the
least
worthy
cases
in
which
there
is
no
evidence
of
discrimination,
while
at
the
same
time
barring
court
access
to
the
more
meritorious
cases
which,
because
they
are
meritorious,
happen
to
have
warranted
more
processing
time
from
the
state
agency,
but
unfortunately
end
up
with
an
adverse
decision
to
the
grievant.
petitioner
has--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--the
point
that
the
petitioner
made
in
his
brief
was
that
the
only
kind
of
cases
in
which
there
would
be
a
quick
termination
would
be
those
in
which
the
state
agency
abandoned
the
processing
for
some
reason
or
the
grievant
just
looking
around
decided
that
his
case
is
not
worth
pursuing
in
this
forum
and
he
took
some
kind
of
voluntary
dismissal,
assuming
the
state
procedures
allowed
that.
i
am
suggesting
that
that's
a
very
narrow
fact
pattern,
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
terminated
only
if
there
has
been
an
abandonment.
the
statute
says
all
terminated
proceedings
lead
to
that
quicker
access
to
federal
court.
there's
a
second
piece
of
evidence.
section
72--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--no,
there
wouldn't
be
a
hearing,
justice
stevens.
what
there
would
probably
be
is
something
very
facial
from
the
submissions
that
were
made
by
the
grievant
that
caused
the
examiner
to
say
this
is
no
case.
and
it
wouldn't
even
go
into
a
more
formalized
type
of
procedure.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
yes.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
yes,
i
do.
anything...
i
don't
mean
to
say
anything
is
possible
in
the
metaphysical
sense,
but
indeed
if
the
examiner
charged
with
responsibility
for
the
case
was
able
to
make
a
quick
facial
determination
based
on
an
affidavit
or
a
filing,
whatever,
some
piece
of
evidence
that
showed
instantaneously
that
there
is
no
case,
the
examiner,
at
least
under
new
york
state's
law,
could
wipe
the
case
right
out
at
that
point.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well,
make
a
finding
that
this
is
no
case.
it's
not
going
to
have
that
full
dress
quality
to
it,
but
it
certainly
would
be
a
finding
of
fact
that
would
be
what
we
call
in
the
new
york
state
law
finding
of
no
probable
cause.
that's
going
to
end
the
proceedings
for
that
grievant.
section
72
of
the
adea
imposes
an
accelerated
eeoc
charge
filing
cut
off
date
in
the
case
of
rapid
agency
termination.
having
a
second
filing
requirement
with
the
eeoc
makes
no
sense
if
the
terminated
state
agency
findings
are
given
preclusive
effect.
a
concurrent
eeoc
filing
would
be
superfluous
if
the
issue
has
already
been
decided
by
the
state
agency.
similarly,
section
72
requires
the
timely
filing
of
an
eeoc
charge--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--it
would
be,
in
my
opinion,
superfluous,
because
if
the
state
finding
is
preclusive,
walking
across
the
street
to
the
federal
building
and
filing
with
the
eeoc
would
serve
no
purpose,
because
the
only
purpose
in
having
the
eeoc
charge
filing
is
to
get
the
visa,
if
you
will,
to
go
to
federal
court.
but
if
the
federal
court
is
already
bound
by
the
state
agency,
you're
going
around
in
a
circle
for
nothing.
and
that's
the
point.
there
is
no
purpose
any
longer
in
having
that
eeoc
charge
filing.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
my...
the
purpose
that
i
assert
is
it
gives
the
eeoc
concurrent
screening
responsibility
in
the
60
days.
but
the
eeoc
can't
issue
the
factfindings
that
you
pointed
out
to
earlier.
therefore
what--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
yes,
i
do.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i
understand
the
practice
has
been
in
certain
cases
to
give
the,
if
the
case
warrants
it
there
may
be
an
informal
type
of
proceeding.
but
they're
really
just
supposed
to
screen
the
cases
and
see
if
they
can
resolve
some
of
the
more
obvious
cases
for
quick
resolution,
call
the
parties
in
and
perhaps
knock
some
heads
together.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
my
point
is
that
is
a
worthwhile
trip
to
the
eeoc,
but
the
eeoc
at
the
end
of
that
trip
doesn't
issue
factfindings.
that
doesn't
mean
the
trip
wasn't
worth
taking,
it
just
means
that
that,
you
have
it
in
place
to
screen
out
some
of
the
cases
that
are
susceptible
to
quick
resolution.
third,
section
14(a)
of
the
adea
provides
for
instant
supersedure
of
all
state
agency
action
upon
the
commencement
of
a
federal
suit.
what
is
supersedure?
it
can
mean
several
things.
if
it
means
that
the
state
proceedings
are
instantly
nullified,
that
interpretation
of
the
word
supersedure
would
totally
foreclose
this
appeal.
however,
we'll
assume
for
purposes
of
going
forward
that
the
word
supersedure
was
merely
intended
by
congress
to
mean
that
the
state
proceedings
should
be
stayed
while
the
federal
court
action
is
pending.
the
practical
result
of
whatever
definition
you
want
to
take
of
supersedure
is
the
same.
once
there
is
a
federal
adea
action
that
has
been
brought,
it
will
abruptly
halt
the
state
agency
proceedings
at
whatever
point
they
have
reached.
the
significance
of
this
provision
is
that
the
state
agency
proceedings
can
be
so
easily
halted
while
they
are
still
pending.
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
giving
those
proceedings
any
more
credence
just
because
they
happen
to
have
been
concluded?
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
because--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--my
point,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
statute
contemplates,
i
mean,
this,
your
point
is
valid,
but
the
statute
contemplates
instant
judicial
supersedure.
and
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense.
but
that's
the
congress'
determination
that
you
can
wait
until
the
eleventh
hour
and
fifty-ninth
minute,
cut
it
off,
and
go
to
court.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
okay.
the
problem
is
if
it's
a
long,
drawn-out
state
procedure,
the
point
that
you're
making
has
greater
validity
than
in
the
case
which
is
also
under
the
statute
in
which
it
happens
quick
and
dirty.
and
you
would
feel
that
a
quick
and
dirty
resolution
is
unfair
to
the
grievant,
but
you
feel
that
long,
drawn-out
procedure
is
unfair
to
the
employer.
that
may
be,
but
there
is
no,
there's
no
line
in
the
adea.
quick
and
dirty
gives
you
a
right
to
go
to
court.
long
and
drawn-out,
but
the
eleventh
minute,
eleventh
hour
fifty-ninth
minute
cut
off
also
allows
you
to
go
to
court.
now
there
may
be
greater
equities
in
your
accessibility
to
court
in
one
case
than
in
the
other,
i
certainly
would
agree.
but
that
line
that
you
have
drawn
is
not
in
the
statute,
sir.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
thank
you,
sir.
the
reason
for
having
instant
supersedure
in
the
adea
is
to
reaffirm,
as
i
see
it,
the
principles
of
federal
preemption.
that
in
turn
means
avoiding
potentially
inconsistent
rulings
by
having
the
state
proceedings
extinguished
upon
the
commencement
of
a
federal
suit.
if
the
commencement
of
a
federal
suit
can
abruptly
halt
a
pending
proceeding,
it
violates
those
principles
of
federal
preemption
if
the
opposite
result
occurs
in
the
case
of
a
completed
state
agency
proceeding.
why?
the
whole
point
of
federal
preemption
is
to
avoid
or
prevent
inconsistent
results.
federal
preemption
should
not
depend
upon
whether
the
state
agency
proceedings
have
gone
one
level
or
a
further
level.
the
only
reason
that
petitioner
submits
for
carving
out
an
exception
to
the
federal
preemption
rules
might
be
to
avoid
giving,
as
we
have
said
before,
the
grievant
two
bites
of
the
apple.
this
competing
consideration
is
based
on
notions
of
judicial
economy
and
repose.
ironically,
it
would
not
accomplish
the
goal
intended,
because
under
most
state
agency
forums
the
grievant,
as
i
said,
can
wait
until
the
eleventh
hour
and
fifty-ninth
minute.
he
can
use
the
state
agency
for
dress
rehearsal
purposes,
and
as
the
stillians
court
notes,
test
his
case
and
practice
his
presentation.
because
instant
judicial
supersedure
allows
it.
he
can
cut
off
his
case
just
at
that
point.
he
would
get
two
bites
of
the
apple.
and
the
whole
reason
for
having
judicial
economy
and
repose,
it
wouldn't
be
served
anyway.
finally,
under
the
adea
statutory
format
a
grievant
is
obliged
to
file
his
charge
with
both
the
state
and
the
federal
agencies
as
jurisdictional
prerequisites--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--he
gets
almost
two
bites.
he
gets
to
practice
the
presentation,
which
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
found
so
abhorrent.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well,
i'm
not--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--well,
i
understand
your
point.
what
i'm
suggesting
here
is...
i
was
only
responding
to
the
eighth
circuit's
point,
that
to
practice
the
presentation
is
somehow
abhorrent
to
the
courts.
because
i
as
a
lawyer
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
practice
my
presentation.
the
fourth
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
with
respect
to
the
obligatory
filing
requirement
with
both
agencies.
when
the
eeoc
filing
takes
place,
that
agency,
as
we
have
discussed
earlier,
cannot
adjudicate
the
claims
and
make
factfindings
in
the
traditional
sense,
as
at
least
as
it
can
do
under
title
vii.
in
denying
eeoc,
factfinding
power
to
the
eeoc,
congress
obviously
eliminated
the
possibility
that
the
eeoc's
findings
would
have
preclusive
effect.
what
can
be
gleaned
from
the
statute
that
it
intended
for
the
state
agencies
findings,
was
any
greater
judicial
impact
intended
for
them?
let's
look
at
the
landscape
of,
against
which
the
adea
is,
has
been
adopted.
some
state
agencies,
some
states,
as
the
court
well
knows,
do
not
even
have
discrimination
statutes.
some
state
agencies
have
discrimination
statutes
but
they
don't
adjudicate.
some
agencies
do
adjudicate.
some
of
the
state
agencies
which
do
adjudicate,
like
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights,
give
an
employer,
but
not
the
employee,
two
bites
of
the
apple
at
the
administrative
stage
in
the
sense
that
there
is
that
first
nonhearing
level
in
which
only
the
worst
cases
get
screened
out
against
the
employee,
but
the
employer,
he
gets
the
public
hearing
if
there
is
a
preliminary
finding
against
him.
if
state
agency
preclusion
were
to
apply,
some
very
strange
results
would
occur
indeed.
the
grievant
who
went
to
the
state
agency
only
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
federal
court
action
would
find
he
never
gets
federal
court
action.
the
state
agency,
presumably
having
less
expertise
than
the
federal
agency,
would
become
the
dominant
agency.
the
eeoc's
presumed
expertise
would
be
lost.
and
worst
of
all,
since
the
state
agency
filing
is
mandatory,
the
aggrieved
employee
would
be
better
off
living
and
working
in
a
state
with
no
state
agency
at
all,
or
at
least
not
in
a
state
like
new
york
where
the
agency
has
that
adjudicatory
power.
could
congress
have
wanted
this
jumbled
state
of
affairs
to
determine
federal
court
access?
congress
did
manifest
its
intent
with
reasonable
clarity.
it
provided
that
in
the
case
of
a
state
agency
filing
there
is
only
60
days
for
that
processing
period.
and
it
also
provided
that
in
that
60-day
period
there
would
be
concurrent,
and
not
sequential,
processing
by
the
eeoc,
not
to
mention
the
doctrine
of
instant
judicial
supersedure.
this
suggests
congress
had
a
twin
purpose.
number
one,
it
wanted
to
give
grievants
easier,
not
a
more
difficult,
access
to
the
federal
court
than
exists
under
title
vii.
and
two,
it
wanted
correspondingly
reduced
reliance
on
the
importance
of
the
state
agency's
processing.
state
agency
preclusion
would
subvert
this
twin
purpose.
agency
preclusion
would
take
away
all
the
considerable
substantive
benefits
of
adea
litigation,
jury
trial,
liquidated
damages,
attorneys'
fees,
front
pay,
and
i
say
without
hesitation
a
more
sophisticated
federal
judiciary.
it
is
doubtful
that
congress
wanted
all
these
virtues
of
a
federal
action
to
be
so
readily
lost
through
the
happenstance
of
state
agency
preclusion.
if
uniformity
and
consistency
under
the
law
is
a
worthwhile
objective,
the
law
in
this
area
would
become
a
veritable
patchwork
quilt
if
state
agency
preclusion
were
to
apply.
the
separate
laws
of
50
states
could
effectively
determine
which,
whether
a
grievant
gets
to
court.
title
vii
and
adea
would
be
treated
differently.
the
principles
of
alexander
and
gardner-denver
favoring
a
judicial
forum
would
be
undermined.
the
bright
line
of
kremer
limiting
preclusion
to
only
cases
where
the
state,
where
there
has
been
actual
state
court
review,
would
be
lost.
the
oscar
mayer
rule
that
limits
the
number
of
restrictions
that
you
could
put
on
access
to
the
federal
court,
that
would
all
go
out
the
window.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
or
longer
if
the
grievant,
feeling
comfortable
but
not
having
a
good
idea,
goes--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--after
60.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
yes.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
if
the
state
agency
tells
him
on
day
62,
we
think
we
can
work
out
something
with
you,
hold
your
lawyer's
federal
court
complaint
in
abeyance,
don't
rush
down
to
that
courthouse.
we
think
we
can
work
something
out,
stay
with
us
a
little
bit
longer,
a
little
bit
longer.
we're
now
up
to
day
100.
grievant
is
scratching
his
head,
what
do
i
do?
fish
or
cut
bait?
put
in
a
quandary
because
he
doesn't
really
have
that
close
consultational
relationship
with
the
agency
people.
he
thinks
he
can
get
a
resolution,
he
thinks
that
he
might
be
able
to
have
his
matter
resolved,
so
he
tarries
a
little
bit
too
long.
that's
an
unfair
case
to
have
the
state
agency
zap
him
with
an
adverse
finding.
what
would
knowledgeable
lawyers
do?
they
would
polarize
the
eeoc,
they
would
polarize
the
agency
processing.
it
would
become
the
main
litigation
background
if
agency
preclusion
were
to
apply,
or
it
would
be
a
minefield
to
be
avoided.
the
middle
ground,
the
thing
we
want
most
of
all,
judicious
use
of
the
state
agency
to
screen
cases
that
are
capable
of
certain
quick
resolution,
the
best
thing
the
agency
can
do,
that
procedure
would
be
lost.
the
whole
idea
of
having
a
limited
deferral
period
for
certain
state
agencies
would
be
subverted
and
the
statute
turned
on
its
head.
