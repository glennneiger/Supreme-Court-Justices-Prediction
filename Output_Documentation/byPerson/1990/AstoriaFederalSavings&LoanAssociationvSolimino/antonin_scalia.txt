justice
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on--
justice
scalia
--you...
it's
your
position
that
the
eeoc
has
no
authority
to
make
findings
in
this
area?
justice
scalia
and
yet
you
say
one
of
the
indications
that
we
should,
we
should
find
a
requirement
to
exceed
to
the
state
ruling
here,
one
of
the
indications
is
that
there
was
not
in
this
case,
as
there
was
in
the
title
vii
case,
a
specific
provision
requiring
the
eeoc
in
making
its
findings
to
give
substantial
weight
to
state
determinations?
right?
justice
scalia
you
rely
on
the
absence
of
that
here.
justice
scalia
but
you
now
tell
us
that
there
is
no
reason
for
such
a
provision
to
exist
here,
because
on
your
view
the
eeoc
has
no
authority
to
make
findings
anyway.
so
why
would
such
a
provision
possibly
be
here?
justice
scalia
wait.
you
find
it
significant
that
there
is
not
in
this
statute
a
provision
requiring
the
eeoc
to
defer
to
state
findings.
you
say
it's
very
significant
that
that
is
missing,
although
it
was
present
in
title
vii,
right?
justice
scalia
now
under
title
vii
the
eeoc
must
make
factual
findings.
justice
scalia
but
here
it's
not
supposed
to
make
findings,
factual
findings,
according
to
you.
justice
scalia
if
it's
not
supposed
to
make
factual
findings,
why
would
you
expect
to
see
the
same
kind
of
provision
you
had
in
title
vii?
justice
scalia
you
would
not
expect
to
find
it.
justice
scalia
mr.
siegel,
under
this
statute
what
weight
is
to
be
given
to
any
eeoc
proceedings
that
have
occurred
on
the
same,
on
the
same
case?
justice
scalia
isn't
there
a
provision
that
says
that?
i
thought
there
was
a
provision
that
said
that.
justice
scalia
well,
why
would
congress
set
up
a
system
in
which
the
court,
the
court
would
review
anything
done
by
the
eeoc
de
novo,
but
would
not
review
anything
done
by
the
states?
justice
scalia
that
would
seem
very
strange.
justice
scalia
in
practice
the
eeoc
has,
despite
the
lack
of
any
authority,
been
conducting
proceedings
in
these?
justice
scalia
and
what
have
the
courts
done
with
those
proceedings?
ignored
them?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
that's
not
surprising
because
they
shouldn't
have
been
conducted
anyway?
and
that's
the
explanation
of
why--
justice
scalia
--why
you
would
treat
the
federal
ones
different
from
the
state
ones?
justice
scalia
you
say
the
only
purpose
you,
the
only
reason
you
can't
go
ahead
immediately
is
on
the
chance
that
there
will
be
a
mediation
that's
successful?
and
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
weight
provision?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
what
would
happen
if
you
didn't
file
suit
immediately
after
the
60
days?
you
continued
the
state
proceedings,
and
they
drag
on
for
2
years,
and
then
it
looks
to
you
as
though
they
are
going
bad.
and
just
before
the
final
state
decision
comes
out
you
pop
into
federal
court
and
file
your
federal
suit.
what
happens
then?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
does
it?
justice
scalia
i
think
his
explanation
for
that
is
the
that
the
only
thing
that
congress
expects
you
to
be
waiting
for
is
mediation.
and
the
state
proceedings
may
be
terminated
very
quickly
in
the
frivolous
cases,
because
the
employer
is
going
to
say,
you
know,
mediate
what?
there's
nothing
here.
so
that
will
be
terminated
quickly.
justice
scalia
--excuse
me,
what's
the
purpose
of
this
eeoc
filing?
i'm
unclear
of
the
role
of
the
eeoc
in
this
whole--
justice
scalia
--what
do
you
assert
the
purpose
of
the
eeoc
filing
is?
justice
scalia
do
you
agree
with
that?
that
the
eeoc
has
no
factfinding
responsibilities--
justice
scalia
--under
this
law?
justice
scalia
they've
been
doing
it,
though?
justice
scalia
um
hum.
justice
scalia
well,
yeah,
i
mean,
bad
is
bad,
but
worse
is
worse.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
something
of
a
spectacle
to
have
a
plaintiff
who
has
gone
all
the
way
through
the
state
proceeding...
he
has
chosen
to
stay
there.
he
could
have
gotten
out
quickly,
the
way
you
have
just
described,
but
he
chooses
not
to.
and
he
goes
all
the
way
through
the
state
proceeding.
people,
the
state
spends
money
to
conduct
these
proceedings,
and
he
loses.
and
then
he
comes
over
to
the
federal
court
and
says
well,
that's
one
trial;
let
me
take
another
bite
of
the
apple,
and
we
start
all
over
again.
justice
scalia
and
i
lost
fair
and
square,
but
i
want
to
start
with
a
fresh
new
slate.
he
gets,
he
gets
two
shots.
justice
scalia
that
gives
them
enough.
i'm
saying,
bad
is
bad,
but
worse
is
worse.
congress
says,
look,
we're
going
to
give
you
every
chance
to
get
out,
but
if
you
choose
not
to
get
out,
if
you
go
all
the
way
through
to
final
judgment
by
the
state,
at
least
at
that
point
we're
not
going
to
go
through
the
whole
circus
again.
you've
had
your
chance,
you've
chosen
to
stay
there,
and
you
have
lost
fair
and
square.
justice
scalia
that's
a
good
response.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on.
as
to
the
last
argument
you
made,
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
persuasive.
he
doesn't
get
two
bites
in
that
situation.
justice
scalia
he
doesn't
want
to
practice
the
presentation.
he
wants
to
be
able
to
roll
the
dice
twice,
to
roll
twice.
he
wants
to
get
a
shot
at
winning
in
the
state.
and
if
he
cuts
it
off
before,
even
if
he
goes
on
for
2
years,
if
he
cuts
it
off
before
the
final
judgment
he
has
not
gotten
a
second
raffle
ticket.
he
gets
only
one,
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
scalia
but
what
your
position
permits
is
that
he
tries
to
win
in
the
state
court.
if
he
wins
there,
he
has
it
and
he
goes
home
with
his
money.
but
if
he
loses
there,
nothing
lost,
he
can
go
back
and
roll
again
in
the
federal
courts.
that's
a
very
unusual
thing.
we
usually
don't
let
that
happen.
justice
scalia
all
this
would
only
happen
in
that
category
of
cases
where
the
state
acts
within
the
60
days.
justice
scalia
but
after
the
60
days
it's
entirely
within
his
control.
if
he
doesn't
want
these
horrible
things
to
happen,
he
can
get
out
of
the
state
system.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
on
the
sixtieth
day
he
can
cut
out.
but
there
is
that
problem
which
i
don't
see
any
way
out
of.
i
think
that's
right.
if
the
state
agency
acts
quickly--
justice
scalia
there
has
to
be
a
background
rule,
ms.
wax,
doesn't
there?
i
mean,
suppose
we
look
at
the
statute
and
we
say
gee,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
say
anything
either
way
about
it.
suppose
we
look
at
the
statute,
it
says
nothing
either
way.
what's
the
background
rule?
i
mean,
you
can
call
it
a
presumption
if
you
like,
or
never
mind
presumption.
we
won't
call
it
a
presumption.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
but
you
acknowledge
that
if
the
statute
gives
no
indication
either
way,
but
it
seems
entirely
neutral
about
it,
the
normal
rule
would
be
that
we
accept
the
findings
of
the
agency?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
isn't
it
possible
that
the
agency
proceeding
terminates
but
doesn't
give
the
claimant
all
the
relief
that
the
claimant
desires?
justice
scalia
and
he
comes
into
federal
court
for
more
relief?
justice
scalia
so
it
wouldn't
be
pointless.
