justice
david
h.
souter
the
first
case
is
a
story
of
federal
savings
and
loan
association
and
solimino,
89-1895.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
respondent,
angelo
solimino,
filed
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
alleging
that
the
petitioner,
astoria
federal
savings
and
loan
association,
had
dismissed
him
because
of
his
age
in
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1967.
the
eeoc
referred
his
claim
to
the
state
agency
responsible
for
like
claims
under
new
york's
own
anti-discrimination
law
which
ruled
against
solimino
on
the
merits
of
his
claim.
rather
than
appealing
that
decision
to
a
state
court,
solimino
filed
a
federal
age
act
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
astoria
then
moved
for
summary
judgment
which
the
court
granted
holding
that
the
findings
of
the
state
agency
precluded
federal
litigation
of
the
claim
that
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
inferring
that
from
the
act's
structure
an
intent
to
deny
preclusive
effect
to
such
date
administrative
proceedings.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
and
hold
that
judicially
unreviewed
findings
of
the
state
agency
have
no
preclusive
effect
on
age
discrimination
proceedings
in
federal
courts.
while
well-established
common
law
principles
such
as
preclusion
rules
are
presumed
to
apply
in
the
absence
of
legislative
intent
to
the
contrary,
congress
need
not
state
expressly
its
intention
to
overcome
a
presumption
of
administrative
estoppel.
rules
of
cleared
statement
are
appropriate
only
where
weighing
and
constant
values
are
at
steak
whereas,
such
values
are
not
represented
by
the
lenient
to
a
presumption
in
favor
of
administrative
estoppel,
the
suitability
of
which
varies
according
to
context.
thus,
the
test
for
the
presumption's
application
is
simply
whether
the
administrative
preclusion
would
be
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
in
enacting
a
particular
statute.
such
an
inconsistency
is
apparent
with
respect
to
the
age
act.
the
act's
filing
requirements
assume
the
possibility
of
federal
consideration
of
age
discrimination
claims
in
the
wake
of
unfavorable
state
administrative
review.
and
yet,
such
consideration
would
be
mere
formality
if
state
agency
findings
would
give
inpreclusive
effect.
our
holding
today
is
consistent
with
the
decision
in
tennessee
and
elliott
in
which
we
denied
estoppel
effect
to
agency
findings
in
a
parallel
context
of
title
vii.
it
also
comports
with
the
broader
scheme
and
enforcement
provisions,
and
although
congress'
wisdom
in
deciding
against
administrative
preclusion
is
relevant
to
our
determination,
the
congressional
choice
in
this
case
enjoys
plausible
policy
support.
