justice
o'connor
mr.
siegel,
do
you
take
the
position
that
congress
has
to
speak
expressly
to
the
issue
of
preclusion
in
order
to
overcome
any
common
law
presumption
about
it?
justice
o'connor
have
our
cases
ever
said
that,
or
have
we
just
found
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that
there
may
not
be
preclusion
or
there
is?
justice
o'connor
but
you
don't
think
there
is
any
rule
that
specific
in
this
area,
do
you?
justice
o'connor
you
would
have
us
apply
the
same
kind
of
presumption
we
did
in
aramco?
justice
o'connor
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
eeoc
on
this
point?
justice
o'connor
ms.
wax,
what
authority
does
the
eeoc
have
to
make
findings
or
to
act?
justice
o'connor
but
its,
its
findings
are
not
binding
on
a
subsequent
federal
court?
