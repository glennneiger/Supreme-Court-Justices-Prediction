ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
first
like
to
address
a
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
o'connor
to
petitioner,
whether
there,
this
court
has
ever
ruled
that
there
needs
to
be
an
express
bar
to
preclusion
in
the
statute
in
order
for
it
to
apply.
that,
this
court
has
never
so
ruled,
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
university
of
tennessee
v.
elliott
shows
that
the
court
looks
and
reasons
inferentially
from
many
different
features
of
a
statute
in
deciding
whether
there
should
be
a
rule
of
preclusion
or
not.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
don't
deny
that
there's
some
kind
of
background
rule,
whether
we
call
it
a
presumption
or
not.
all
we
deny
is
that
a
statute
needs
to
say
in
so
many
words
that
there
shall
be
no--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that
a
court
shall
not
be
bound.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
would
generally
go
along
with
that.
now,
in
elliott
the
court
reasoned
by
inference
from,
largely
from
a
provision
that
said
nothing
about
the
weight
that
courts
give
to
state
agency
findings.
the
substantial
weight
provision
that
the
court
relied
on
in
part
in
elliott
addressed
itself
to
the
weight
that
the
eeoc
would
give
to
state
administrative
findings,
and
it
reasoned
that
it
made
no
sense
for
courts
to
give
preclusive
effect
if
the
eeoc
did
not.
in
the
government's
view
the
answer
to
this
case
is
found
in
a
few
specific
features
of
the
age
act,
features
that
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
giving
preclusive
effect
to
state
administrative
findings
in
a
subsequent
federal
action
under
the
age
act.
first,
as
my
colleague
has
said,
there
is
section
14(b)
of
the
age
act,
the
so-called
deferral
provision.
this
section
provides
for
a
delay
in
the
filing
of
the
civil
action
until
a
state
agency
has
had
at
least
60
days
to
consider
the
complaint
of
discrimination,
unless
the
state
proceedings
are
earlier
terminated.
now,
since
employees
who
are
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
state
proceedings
generally
don't
go
to
federal
court,
14(b)
clearly
contemplates
a
civil
action
following
an
unfavorable
state
agency
decision,
including
a
finding
of
no
discrimination.
and
to
answer
a
point
that
has
come
up
in
this
argument,
congress
clearly
contemplated
that
there
would
be
time
when
the
state
would
be
able
to
make
findings
of
fact
and
issue
a
no
probable
cause
determination
within
that
60-day
period.
and
on
page
20
of
our
brief
we
cite
to
a
citation
in
this
court's
decision
in
oscar
mayer
to
remarks
of
senator
dirksen
during
the
passage
of
the
age
act
where
he
said
yes,
there
are
many
occasions
in
which
60
days
is
going
to
be
enough
for
a
dispensation
of
these
claims.
but
if
the
state's
factfinding
is
binding
on
the
federal
court,
a
civil
action
under
such
circumstances
would
be
pointless.
the
second
feature
of
the
age
act
is
section
7(d)--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right,
that
could
happen.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
absolutely.
and
in
that
case--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we're
not
saying
that
every
case
in
which
there
is
a
termination
before
60
days
either
in
favor
of
the
complainant
or
against
the
complainant
would
make
a
subsequent
civil
action
pointless.
we're
not
saying
that.
we're
saying
that
there's
going
to
be
a
significant
subset
of
cases
in
which
it
would
be
pointless,
and
those
are
the
very
cases
in
which
the
complainant
most
needs
another
look
at
his,
and
most
deserves
another
look
at
his
claim,
namely
where
there
has
been
an
adverse
decision
that
is
on
the
merits
with
a
no
probable
cause
determination.
it
might
be
that
there
would
be
a
resolution
based
on
procedural
defects.
there
could
be
a
resolution
in
favor
of
the
individual
and
he
could
want
to
go
to
court
to
get
more
relief.
but
in
that
case,
of
course,
he'd
still
be
required
to
prove
his
case
again
de
novo.
i
mean,
the
de
novo
rule
favors
employees
under
some
circumstances
and
employers
under
other
circumstances.
section
7(d).
the
age
act
permits
simultaneous
or
successive
consideration
of
a
complaint
by
a
state
or
federal
agency,
but
as
7(d)
reveals,
if
an
individual
decides
to
file
with
a
state
agency
first,
then
he
must
file
his
complaint
with
the
eeoc
within
30
days
of
a
final
state
agency
action.
therefore
the
statute
clearly
contemplates
an
eeoc
investigation
and
conciliation
of
a
claim
on
which
the
state
agency
has
already
rendered
a
decision.
now,
if
that
decision
had
preclusive
effect,
that
would
read
the
eeoc
right
out
of
the
act,
because
the
eeoc
would
have
nothing
to
do.
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
if
there
was
a
finding
of
no
discrimination
by
the
state
agency
and
a
subsequent
filing
with
the
eeoc,
and
the
eeoc
made
its
own
findings
of
fact
and
approached
the
employer
and
said,
let's
sit
down
and
try
to
solve
a
problem
that
we
perceive
exists
with
this
employee,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
employer
would
even
answer
his,
the
phone
calls
of
the
agency.
the
employer
would
say,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
end
of
case.
the
state
agency
has
made
findings
of
fact
in
our
favor.
those
findings
are
binding
in
a
subsequent
federal
court
action
where
the
grievant
has
to
go
to
get
relief
under
the
age
act,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
talk
to
you.
so
that's
why
section
7(d)
shows,
and
the
role
of
the
eeoc
as
contemplated
by
section
7(d)
shows,
that
state
agency
finding
cannot
have
preclusive
effect.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
age
act
does
not
explicitly
provide
authority
for
the
eeoc
to
make
findings
in
so
many
words,
and
it
differs
from
title
vii
in
that
title
vii,
the
sections
of
title
vii
that
govern
the
eeoc's
role
do
speak
of
a
probable
cause
determination
or
no
probable
cause
determination.
however,
the
eeoc
has
decided
to
make
findings.
in
practice
the
eeoc
does
investigate
and
make
findings,
because
it
has
discovered
that
it's
very
difficult
to
solve
a
discrimination
problem
and
get
a
conciliation
agreement
if
you
don't
know
what
the
problem
is.
so
fact,
the
practice
under
the
age
act
and
title
vii
has
converged
since
1978
when
the
authority
to
enforce
the
age
act
was
transferred
from
the
department
of
labor
to
the
eeoc.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
eeoc's
factfinding
under
the
age
act
is
perfectly
legitimate.
in
fact,
it's
absolutely
necessary
to
carry
out
the
eeoc's
mandate.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
this
court
has
never
so
held,
but
the
lower
courts...
under
the
age
act.
under
title
vii
it
has
been
established
in
chandler
v.
roudebush
and
many
subsequent
cases
that
eeoc
factfinding
is
not
binding,
that
there
is
de
novo
review
in
a
subsequent
federal
action.
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
that
rule
applies
under
the
age
act.
no
court
has
held
otherwise.
which
brings
me
to
the
third
point
and
the
third
reason
why
preclusive
effect
for
state
agency
findings
just
does
not
square
with
the
scheme
here.
the
eeoc's
factfinding
does
not
get
preclusive
effect
in
a
subsequent
federal
action.
it
simply
makes
no
sense,
therefore,
to
give
state
findings
preclusive
effect,
because
the
role
of
the
eeoc
and
the
state
agency
is
essentially
the
same
under
the
age
act,
and
that
is
to
try
and
resolve
problems
of
discrimination
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
grievant
short
of
a
federal
lawsuit,
to
keep
these
issues
and
these
conflicts
out
of
court.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
under
803,
federal
rule
of
evidence
803(8)(c),
which
allows
the
admission
into
evidence
in
a
federal
civil
court,
federal
civil
action
of
proceedings
and
records
of
government
agencies,
that
it
would
be
admissible
and
it
could
be
admitted
in
the
record.
now
age
discrimination
actions
are
tried
before
a
jury,
so
a
jury
would
be
perfectly
entitled
to
evaluate
that
and
evaluate
the
actual
evidence
and
the
answers,
and
the
transcripts
as
part
of
the
evidence
as
a
whole.
