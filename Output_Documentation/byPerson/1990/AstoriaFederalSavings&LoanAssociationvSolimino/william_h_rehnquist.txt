v.

mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
siegel,
what
case
is
it
of
ours
that
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
preclusion
for
an
unreviewed
administrative
finding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
elliott
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
presumption
in
favor.
it
quotes
some
of
the
other
cases
and
says
we
have
frequently
fashioned
federal
common
law
rules
of
preclusion
in
the
absence
of
a
governing
statute.
that
just
says
we
may
do
it.
i
don't
read
that
as
saying
there
is
a
presumption
of
administrative
preclusion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
state
tribunal
pass
on
the
claim
under
the
federal
statute,
or
just
on
the
similar
claim
under
the
state
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
your
time?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
flamm,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
flamm.
ms.
wax,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
siegel,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
siegel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
