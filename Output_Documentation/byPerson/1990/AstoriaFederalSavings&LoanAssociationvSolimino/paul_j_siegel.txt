mr.
paul
j.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
an
unreviewed
state
administrative
agency
finding
of
no
probable
cause
dismissing
an
age
discrimination
claim
bars
the
subsequent
claim
under
the
adea
in
federal
court
under
this
court's
decision
in
university
of
tennessee
v.
elliott.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
fashion
a
rule
of
preclusion
under
the
adea
because
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
adea
or
on
the
face
of
the
statute
would
dictate
otherwise.
the
adea
can
be
interpreted
consistent
with
preclusion
and
to
effectuate
congress'
stated
purpose
in
eliminating
age
discrimination.
the
pertinent
facts
before
the
court
are
undisputed.
mr.
solimino
was
employed
by
astoria
federal
and
terminated
in
march
of
1982.
a
charge
of
discrimination
was
filed
with
the
eeoc
in
march,
on
or
about
march
18.
it
was
referred
to
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights
for
processing,
a
factfinding
conference
was
held
later
that
year,
and
on
january
25,
1983,
approximately
10
months
later,
a
determination
was
issued
finding
no
probable
cause
and
dismissing
his
claim.
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
agency's
appeal
board,
and
in
may
of
1984
it
sustained
the
dismissal
of
the
charge.
a
lawsuit
subsequently
followed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
later
was
made
by
astoria
federal
on
two
bases.
one
was
that
the
claim
was
time-barred.
the
other
was
that
it
was
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
administrative
preclusion.
the
motion
was
granted
only
on
that
second
basis,
and
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
an
appeal
followed
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed,
finding
under
elliott
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
rule
of
preclusion.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
reverse
that
decision.
this
court
frequently
has
fashioned
common
law
rules
of
preclusion
in
the
absence
of
statutory
language
directing
that
such
rules
not
be
established.
in
his
brief
respondent
does
not
dispute
that
the
doctrine
of
common
law
preclusion
is
sufficiently
established
in
the
federal
common
law,
and
himself
refers
to
it
as
a
presumption.
in
elliott,
with
respect
to
title
vii,
the
court
defined
the
applicable
test
by
stating
the
question
actually
before
us
is
whether
a
common
law
rule
of
preclusion
would
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
it
was
found
not
to
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent
in
title
vii
for
two
reasons,
both
of
which
are
absent
from
the
adea.
first
was
that
a
substantial
weight
clause
had
been
added
in
1972
to
title
vii
which
explicitly
stated
how
much
weight
should
be
given
to
a
finding
by
a
state
agency.
before
the
eeoc
was
free
to
give
more
weight
or
less
weight
or
no
weight,
but
now
a
maximum
had
been
set.
the
second
was
this
court's
decision
in
chandler,
which
again
was
based
substantially
upon
the
1972
amendments
to
title
vii.
both
of
those
are
absent
from
the
adea.
in
elliott
this
court
went
on
to
state
that
a
claim
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983,
the
post-civil
war
act,
was
barred
by
an
administrative
finding,
that
preclusion
was
appropriate
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history
to
indicate
otherwise.
the
court
cited
allen
for
the
proposition
supporting
that
administrative
preclusion.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
it
is
our
position
that
congress
must
in
some
specific
manner,
yes,
state
that
preclusion
should
not
apply.
it
need
not
use
those--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--you
are
correct
that
the
rule
was
done
by
the
court
depending
on
each
specific
statute.
the
closest
analogy
might
be
this
court's
recent
decision
in
aramco
involving,
while
it
wasn't
preclusion,
it
certainly
was
another
doctrine
of,
in
that
case
against
extraterritoriality.
the
court
required
a
rather
specific
statement--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--there
is--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--yes.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
to
find
a
specific
evidence
of
congressional
intent
either
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
i
believe
under
the
adea
deference
should
not
be
accorded
to
the
eeoc
because
of
the
specific
language
of
the
adea.
from
its
inception,
no
factfinding
was
to
be
conducted
by
the
federal
government
agency,
initially
the
department
of
labor
and
later
the
eeoc,
much
like
the
department
of
labor's
authority
or
lack
of
authority
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
only
in
title
vii
was
the
eeoc
asked
to
make
findings
and
conduct
investigations.
under
title
vii
the
federal
agency
was
asked
to
explore
the
possibility
of
persuasion,
mediation,
and
conciliation.
the
eeoc,
i
believe,
has
grossly
exceeded
the
authority
under
the
adea
by
engrafting
title
vii
principles
with
respect
to
making
findings
and
the
weight
of
those
findings.
application
of
the
doctrine
of
administrative
preclusion
would
serve
a
very
significant
purpose,
or
perhaps
several
of
them.
first
it
would
achieve--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
statute
provides
no
finding,
no
basis
for
the
eeoc
to
make
findings.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
i
believe
the
absence
of
it,
as
the
eighth
circuit
said
in
stillians,
is
very
significant--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--i
may
not
be
following
your
question,
but
i
believe
that
the
adea's
lack
of
any
basis
for
limiting
or
providing
a
maximum
states
no
congressional
intent
to
limit
the
state's
agency's
effect,
just
as
there
was
no
limit
to
the
effect
in
the
1983
claim.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
that
also
is
correct.
it's
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
congress--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--i
would
certainly
not
expect
to
find
it,
nor
is
there
any
other
language
in
the
adea
which
would
limit
application
of
administrative
preclusion.
you're
correct
in
that
there
is
no,
if
there
is
no
findings
to
be
made
there
is
certainly
no
limit
or
maximum
to
those
findings.
but
there
is
no
other
indication,
as
had
been
in
title
vii,
that
there
should
be
a
maximum
for
the
state's
administrative
finding
to
be
given.
administrative
preclusion
would
achieve
certain
very
significant
goals.
one
would
be
to
avoid
relitigation
of
claims.
it
would
avoid
the
parties
being
twice
faced
with
exhaustive
proceedings.
in
this
case
the
proceeding
before
the
state
lasted
well
over
a
year.
in
the
discussions
with
regard
to
section
14(a)
of
the
clause
added
regarding
supersedure
of
state
actions,
was
added
for
the
specific
purpose
of
avoiding
a
multiplicity
of
actions.
that
was
one
of
the
few
congressional
expressions
of
its
intent
with
respect
to
what
should
happen.
this
court
increasingly
has
required
specific
proof
of
congressional
intent
to
overcome
various
presumptions,
whether
it
was
the
extraterritoriality
presumption
in
the
aramco
case
or
whether
it
was
the
presumption
regarding
concurrent
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
in
yellow
freight.
it
has
required
that
the
party
asserting
a
presumption
shouldn't
apply
to
come
forward
with
rather
specific
evidence
of
congressional
intent.
there
is
none
in
this
instance.
with
respect
to
section
14(a),
for
example,
of
the
adea,
it
merely
states
that
nothing
in
the
adea
should
effect
the
jurisdiction
of
any
agency
of
any
state
performing
like
functions
to
the
eeoc,
except
that
upon
commencement
of
an
action
under
the
adea,
such
action
shall
supersede
the
state
action.
that
does
not
indicate
that
if
a
proceeding
already
has
been
completed
by
the
state
and
a
decision
rendered
by
the
state,
that
that
should
be
reversed
and
vacated.
merely--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--the
utah
mining
and
elliott
speak
about
a
rule
of
preclusion
that
has
been
applied.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
i
may
have
overstated
it,
but
the
court
in
utah
mining
and
in
elliott
has
gone
forward
in
the
absence
of
congressional
language
to
the
contrary
to
apply
a
rule
of
preclusion.
and
that
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
case
as
well
because
of
the
lack
of
congressional
language
to
the
contrary.
with
respect
further
to
section
14(a),
they
speak
about
the
performance
of
like
functions
and
use
performing,
again
seeming
to
indicate
a
present
tense,
as
in
the
same
manner
that
an
action
now
newly
instituted
under
the
adea
would
replace
another
action.
this
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
objective
avoiding
multiple
lawsuits,
and
is
further
consistent
with
senator
javits'
comment
that
the
act
included
a
proviso
guarding
against
preemption
of
state
proceedings.
with
respect
to
section
14(b),
which
also
has
been
cited
in
opposition
to
our
position,
which
provides
that
no
suit
may
be
brought
under
the
adea
before
expiration
of
the
60-day
period
following
referral
unless
such
proceedings
have
been
earlier
terminated,
it
does
not
define
the
word
terminated.
but
moreover,
it
doesn't
state
how
termination
might
occur.
if
termination
occurred
on
the
state's
behalf
because
the
complainant
insisted
and
directed
that
i
intend
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
hence
i
would
like
to
explore
the
possibility
of
conciliation,
the
possibility
of
mediation,
but
no
further,
that
would
appear
to
be
consistent
with
this
court's
ruling
in
oscar
mayer,
which
directed
that
a
complainant
file
a
charge
with
the
state
agency
even
though
it
was
already
time-barred.
it
spoke
about
the
purpose
of
14(b)
being
commencement
of
a
proceeding,
not
exhaustion
or
even
participation,
merely
commencement.
in
the
attorney
general
of
new
york's
brief
in
this
matter
it
was
stated
that
it
would
not,
it
would
appear
to
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
adea
for
the
state
agency
to
terminate
upon
instruction
from
the
complainant
to
do
so.
moreover,
that
termination
within
the
scope
of
commercial
office
products
could
very
well
be
a
termination
that
was
more
of
a
suspension
that
would
allow
the
adea
proceeding
to
commence,
to
conclude,
and
then
the
state
might
at
that
point
reinstate
its
proceeding.
the
termination
need
not
be
a
final
one.
and
under
new
york's
proceedings
it
certainly
could
have
resulted
from
administrative
convenience.
it
could
have
resulted
from
the
lack
of
cooperation.
it
could
have
resulted
from
any
number
of
reasons.
but
the
basic
purpose,
as
oscar
mayer
stated,
was
merely
to
screen
from
the
courts
those
type
of
claims
that
might
be
settled
to
the
grievant's
satisfaction
on
a
local
level.
they
used
settled,
they
did
not
use
adjudicated.
finally,
it
would
also
be
an
affirmative
defense
to
be
raised
by
an
employer,
which
might
or
might
not
be
upheld
depending
on
whether
it
was
timely
raised
and
whether
sufficient
due
process
had
been
afforded
to
make
collateral
estoppel
a
bonafide
defense.
it
has
also
been
asserted
that
the
adea
was
enacted
in
the
first
place
due
to
dissatisfaction
with
the
state
laws
then
existing.
that's
a
very
great
overstatement
of
the
congressional
record.
if
there
was
dissatisfaction
at
all,
it
was
in
the
states
that
did
not
yet
have
state
age
laws.
new
york
had
one.
in
fact
it
was
regularly
discussed
and
cited
in
kremer
approvingly.
senator
javits,
who
was
then
the
new
york
attorney,
had
been
the
new
york
attorney
general
and
was
a
major
proponent
of
the
adea,
referred
to
the
new
york
law
during
testimony.
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
dissatisfaction,
certainly
with
the
new
york
law.
it's
also--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--since
the
statute
does
not
even
provide
for
eeoc
proceedings,
i
believe
that
no
preclusive
effect
should
be
given
to
an
eeoc
proceeding.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
well,
7(d)(2)
refers
to
the
powers
of
the
agency
and
speaks
about
persuasion,
conciliation,
and
mediation.
but
it
doesn't
say,
to
my
recollection,
that
it
would
not
be
preclusive
as
to
the
eeoc
itself.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
back--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--i'm
sorry.
the
backdrop
against
which
the
statute
was
enacted
was
one
where
other
agency
proceedings,
such
as
in
utah
mining,
had
been
given
preclusive
effect.
that
was
where
it
started.
why
would
they
have
done
that?
the
department
of
labor
was
selected
instead
of
the
eeoc
in
the
first
instance
to
move
federal
claims,
once
asserted,
along
quickly.
it
was
presumed
that
older
workers
might
have
fewer
productive
years
left,
and
therefore
shorter
time
periods
were
utilized
to
get
to
court
more
quickly.
at
that
point
senator
javits
noted
how
far
behind
the
eeoc
was
after
only
3
years.
so
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
intent
at
all
for
at
a
federal
level
there
to
be
factfinding
and
other
slow-moving
proceedings.
there
also
was
given
the
possibility
to
grievants
of
removing
the
cases
rather
quickly
from
the
state
agency,
and
by
filing
a
claim
after
only
60
days
that
would
allow
you
to
move
ahead.
and
moreover,
the
eeoc
and
the
state--
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
--the
eeoc
has
conducted
proceedings
in
the
nature
of
factfinding
as
they
might
under
title
vii,
and
they
have
even
engrafted
onto
it
the
substantial
weight
clause
after
the
jurisdiction
was
given
to
the
eeoc
in
1978
in
the
reorganization.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
eeoc's
proceedings
have
never
been
held
to
bar
any
federal
action,
to
my
knowledge.
in
fact
in
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue,
none
have
even
mentioned
it.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
yes,
sir,
that's
our
position.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
yes.
and
the
state
agency
findings
were
deemed
to
be
final
in
their
own
states.
it
was
only
a
question
then
of
due
process.
in
new
york
our
proceeding
was
held
to
have
due
process,
a
human
rights
proceeding,
not
this
particular
one,
under
the
kirkland
case.
again
it
was
looked
at
as
did
you
have
enough
to
be
final
in
your
state.
so
with
respect
to
the
eeoc
factfinding,
again
there
is
not
even
a
legislative
discussion
other
than
to
go
away
from
any
eeoc
model.
it
has
also
been
asserted
that
somehow
the
adea
should
be
interpreted
in
the
same
manner
as
title
vii,
the
procedural
dissimilarities
in
effect
to
be
ignored.
as
this
court
stated
in
lorillard
v.
pons
when
finding
that
a
jury
trial
was
appropriate
under
the
adea,
they
talked
about
while
there
might
be
substantive
similarities,
the
procedural
schemes
were
very
different.
since
they
were
so
different
it
would
be
unavailing,
in
the
court's
word,
to
use
title
vii
to
interpret
the
adea.
moreover,
senator
javits
in
the
legislative
history
specifically
called
for
these
laws
to
be
enforced
independently
of
each
other,
and
had,
congress
had
rejected
an
adea
format
based
upon
title
vii.
pre-suit
filing
periods
are
different,
the
statutes
are
so
different
that
utilizing
title
vii
to
interpret
the
adea
in
this
particular
instance
would
be
very
inappropriate.
there
also
was
asserted
that
there
is
a
lack
of
control
over
which
agency
might
handle
your
charge,
and
as
a
consequence
that
might
be
unfair
to
a
claimant.
that
argument
misses
the
mark.
it
misses
it
for
a
few
reasons.
while
you
might
as
a
claimant
be
required
to
spend
60
days
before
a
state
administrative
agency,
concurrently
the
eeoc
also
could
be
processing
your
charge.
in
that
instance
the
court
found
in
oscar
mayer
that
there
might
be
the
benefit
of
two
consecutive,
two
concurrent
rather
than
consecutive
efforts
to
conciliate
and
mediate.
you
might
work
out
a
settlement,
the
courts
wouldn't
be
burdened
with
further
litigation,
nor
would
the
state
agency,
because
the
effect
of
the
adea
would
have
been
achieved,
which
was
a
nonjudicial
settlement.
moreover,
the
attorney
general
notes,
as
i
have
stated
before,
that
very
likely
the
claimant,
if
asking
to
now
leave
the
agency,
would
be
granted
a
termination.
new
york
state's
division
of
human
rights
from
the
outset
notes
conciliation
is
the
preferred
manner
of
reconciliation;
if
you
would
like
to
explore
this,
please
so
state.
that
happens
at
the
very
beginning
of
each
case.
that
could
be
further
emphasized.
it
has
also
been
asserted
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
laypersons
to
somehow
make
this
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
and
again
that's
inappropriate.
it's
inappropriate
because
first
of
all
this
court
has
stated
that
everyone
who
makes
a
claim
under
a
federal
discrimination
law
is
bound
to
read
and
understand
what
they
have
stated.
the
court
so
stated
that
in
mohasco,
where
the
complex
filing
requirements
of
title
vii,
with
the
initial
60-day
exclusive
period
for
the
state,
and
then
the
240-day
eeoc
period
and
how
they
might
interact
were
explained
and
a
grievant
was
charged
with
that
understanding.
but
what's
more,
in
kremer,
certainly
the
appellant
who
had
appealed
before
the
new
york
state
courts
and
been
unsuccessful
did
not
expect
that
his
later
claim
in
federal
court
under
title
vii
would
be
barred.
however,
after
that
the
notice
of
dismissal
of
the
state,
it's
in
our
joint
appendix
at
page
95,
specifically
states
that
an
adverse
finding
may
very
well
bar
you
and
in
effect
it
warns
please
think
twice
before
doing
this.
a
similar
warning
could
be
stated
on
the
notice
of
charge.
the
state
agency
could
tell
the
grievant,
if
adjudication
is
made
it
might
bar
your
adea
lawsuit.
if
you
would
like
to
restrict
these
proceedings
to
investigation
and
conciliation
or
mediation,
please
so
advise
us.
finally,
it
has
been
argued
that
there
might
be
different
results
in
different
states.
i
think
the
adea
already
envisioned
that.
it
envisioned
it
because
there
were
already
two
different
deferral
periods,
180
days
if
you
were
not
in
the
deferral
state,
300
if
you
were.
the
kremer
decision
envisions
different
results
in
different
states,
because
if
your
state
provides
for
an
appeal
of
a
state
agency
dismissal
and
you're,
depending
on
the
burden
of
proof
that
is
utilized,
you
may
thereafter
be
barred.
so
the
mere
fact
that
you
might
be
in
new
york
versus
a
different
state
is
certainly
not
determinative.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
60-day
period?
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
60-day
period,
as
i
interpret
it,
is
exactly
that.
that
we
might
be
able
to,
as
oscar
mayer
stated,
we
might
be
able
to
screen
from
the
courts
cases
through
that
conciliation
process.
and
after
the
state
has
those
60
days,
then
you
as
the
claimant
have
the
option
of
filing
a
suit
and
thereby
superseding
any
further
state
actions
on
your
claim.
in
this
instance
the
60-day
period
came
and
went,
and
almost
a
year
later
an
adjudication
was
made.
so
it's
not
as
though
on
the
sixtieth
day
anything
happened.
it
went
on
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
under
14(b)
you
would
absolutely
have
the
right
to
do
that.
under
14(a)
that
would
supersede
the
state
proceeding,
which
would
then
suddenly
stop.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
well,
it
does
in
the
fact
that
you
have
utilized
the
state
proceedings
for
investigation,
you
have
considered
the
possibility
of
conciliation,
you
have
avoided
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuits
because
the
state
proceeding
was
cut
off
at
some
point
before
a
judgment
in
that
sense,
and
no
probable
cause
judgment,
and
you
then
moved
forward.
as
the
court
stated
in
stillians,
if
you
instead
went
on
to
get
a
dismissal
first,
in
effect
you
have
elected
your
remedy,
or
as
they
described
it
you
have
made
your
bed
and
you
are
then
compelled
to
lie
in
it.
so
the
claimant
has
that
option.
when
the
claimant
exercises
the
option
to
remain
before
the
agency
for
a
considerable
period
of
time,
all
the
way
through
to
an
adjudicatory
finding
against
him,
then
he
has
already
made
an
election.
and
section
621
of
the
statute,
which
talks
about
its
purpose,
only
speaks
about
the
purpose
of
eliminating
age
discrimination.
it
doesn't
speak
about
the
purpose
of
encouraging
age
discrimination
litigation.
and
so
the
purpose
of
the
act
would
be
consistent
with
14(a).
otherwise
what
would
be
happening
is
that
the
agency
proceeding
would
be
reduced
in
effect
to
a
mere
dress
rehearsal,
as
the
eighth
circuit
noted.
you
could
pretry
your
case.
you
could
get
the
employer's
case.
in
this
case
there
was
a
court
stenographer
that
took
down
sworn
testimony.
in
effect,
the
proceeding
would
become
discovery.
if
you
were
unhappy
with
the
first
adjudication
against
you,
you
could
now
relitigate
it
again,
perhaps
having
practiced
in
the
first
instance.
nowhere
in
the
statute
is
there
any
indication,
or
in
its
legislative
history,
that
a
claimant
was
meant
to
have
two
full
bites
of
an
apple.
it
appeared
that
you
were
meant
to
have
an
effort
to
conciliate
and
mediate,
not
to
litigate
twice
and
fully.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
the
state
does
not
rule
upon
the
adea
action.
it
makes
a
factual
finding
which
we
assert
should
then
be
adopted
by
the
court
under
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
but
it
is
not
charged
with
ruling
on
the
state
action
any
more
than
in
kremer
what
occurred
was
an
appeal
of
a
federal
dismissal.
it
was
an
appeal
of
a
state
no
probable
cause
under
its
own
law.
we
argue
that
this
would
be
consistent
with
kremer.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
yes.
it
can
be
brought
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
just
like
a
fair
labor
standards
act
claim.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
we
believe
that
it
would
be
just
as
appropriate
for
the
state
court
to
do
so
as
it
would
be
for
the
federal
court,
because
it
would
regardless
be
under
the
adea.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
yes,
i
do.
mr.
paul
j.
siegel
i
believe
that
our
argument
covered
the
points
raised,
but
there
was
one
question
with
respect
to,
as
it
was
termed,
the
background
rule.
this
court
in
elliott,
specifically
citing
allen
and
migra,
said
nonetheless
they
support
the
view
that
congress,
in
enacting
the
reconstruction
of
civil
rights
statutes,
did
not
intend
to
create
an
exception
to
the
general
rules
of
preclusion.
so
it
has
been
termed
a
general
rule.
with
respect
to
the
eeoc's
expertise
that
has
been
referred
to
several
times,
it
kind
of
strains
the
imagination
to
think
that
an
agency
that
received
age
discrimination
coverage
in
1978
somehow
has
greater
expertise
than
the
agency
that
had
it
since
1958,
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights.
and
it
would
not
be
a
nullity
to
have
had
the
eeoc
process
this
because
they
might
be
able
to
work
out
a
resolution
or
they
might
file
their
own
independent
proceeding.
so
in
either
event
that
7(d)
has
a
life
apart
from
administrative
preclusion.
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
second
circuit's
decision,
remand
this
matter
back
to
the
second
circuit
with
instructions
to
consider
whether
sufficient
due
process
was
afforded
so
that
collateral
estoppel
effect
be
given
to
the
adverse
decision
of
the
state
division
of
human
rights.
thank
you.
