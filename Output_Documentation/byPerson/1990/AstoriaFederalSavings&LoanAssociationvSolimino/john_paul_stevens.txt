justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point
also;
to
what
extent
is
it
realistic
to
assume
there
would
be
hearings,
other
than,
you
know,
just
a
brief
negotiation,
within
the
60-day
period?
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is
if
they
had
a
hearing
and
you
lost
it,
within
the
60
days
you've
got
an
absolute
right
to
go
to
federal--
justice
stevens
--but
you
don't
contend
there's
a
likelihood
that
there
would
be
actual
factual
determinations
made
within
the
60-day
period?
justice
stevens
oh.
justice
stevens
and
make
findings
of
fact
explaining
it.
i
see
what
you--
justice
stevens
ms.
wax,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
your
view
would
the,
an
adverse
finding
by
the
state
administrative
agency
be
admissible
in
a
federal
judicial
action?
