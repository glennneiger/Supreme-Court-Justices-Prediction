ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
connecticut
has
a
unique
prejudgment
attachment
statute
which
allows
anybody
with
a
colorable
claim
to
attach
a
defendant's
real
estate
before
bringing
the
lawsuit
without
giving
notice
to
that
defendant
until
after
the
attachment
has
been
placed,
without
any
bond
to
protect
the
defendant
against
a
wrongful
attachment,
and
without
reciting
any
particular
reasons
for
the
attachment.
this
process
is
quite
routine
in
connecticut,
or
at
least
it
was
until
the
second--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
or
the
defendant
is
transferring
his
property
in
fraud
of
creditors
or
some
other
emergency
circumstances,
or
the
defendant
is
a
deadbeat
and
doesn't
pay
his
debts,
whatever.
this
procedure
is
so
routine
in
connecticut
that
before
the
second
circuit
decision
below
it
was
routinely...
there
were
300
to
400
real
estate
attachments
per
week
before
lawsuits
were
even
brought.
and
this
figure
i
get
from
the
attorney
general's
estimate
in
his...
in
her
petition
for
a
rehearing
below.
in
this
case
there
was
no
need
for
the
attachment.
there
was
no
need
to
get
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
respondent.
there
was
no
showing
that
he
could
not
or
would
not
pay
any
eventual
judgment.
there
were
no
emergency
circumstances
as--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--i
am
not
suggesting
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
your...
this
court
has
looked
at
several
factors,
and
among
the
factors
in
deciding
whether
something
was
constitutional
was
in
mitchell,
i
believe,
where
the
court
emphasized
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
file
an
affidavit
that
the
property
in
which
he
had
a
security
interest
was
at
risk.
all
we're
doing
in
this
case
is
absence
of
advance
notice
and
the
lack
of
a
bond.
again,
the
litigation
was
unrelated
to
the
property.
and
another
peculiarity
of
connecticut
law
is
that
we
have
no
homestead
exemption
whatsoever,
so
that
once
a
person's
home
is
attached,
there
is
no
cushion
left
to
the
homeowner.
exactly
how
it
works
is
illustrated
by
this
case,
and
that
is
that
mr.
digiovanni
presented
a
one-sided
affidavit
to
a
judge
on
the
papers
2
days
after
the
assault
occurred.
and
the
affidavit
is,
as
this
court
has
already
noticed,
a
bare
minimum.
"on
march
13
i
was
willfully,
wantonly,
and
maliciously
assaulted.
"
"the
assault
broke
my
left
wrist
and
further
caused
an
ecchymosis
to
my
right
eye,
as
well
as
other
injuries.
"
"my
left
arm
is
in
a
cast
and
i
am
restricted
in
my
usual
duties.
"
"and
i
have
further
expended
sums
of
money
for
medical
care
and
treatment,
and
i
will
be
obliged
to
spend
sums
in
the
future.
"
"in
my
opinion
the
foregoing
facts
are
sufficient
to
show
that
there
is
probable
cause.
"
now
the
questioning
to
the
attorney
general
was
on
the
standard
for
probable
cause
in
connecticut,
and
the
cases
are
quite
clear
that
the
standard
for
probable
cause
is
a...
that
you
can
assert
a
colorable
position
that
you
have
a
claim
against
the
defendant.
that
subjective
belief,
probable
cause,
does
not
have
to
be
more
true
than
false.
as
long
as
you
can
bring
forth
some
statement
of
facts
that
you
have
a
colorable
claim,
you
can
get
an
attachment.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
i
vigorously
disagree,
your
honor.
there
is--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--there
are
several
cases
cited
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
for
the
proposition
that
probable
cause
means
merely
that
he
has
to
have
a
belief
in
his
cause
of
action
and
that
belief
does
not
need
to
be
more
true
than
false.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
i
don't
think
you
will,
your
honor.
in
addition,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
affidavit
that
we
have
in
connecticut,
even
though
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
said
it
must
be
factually
specific,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
in
two
cases
and
the
connecticut
appellate
court
in
four
cases
have
all
said
it
doesn't
matter
whether
your
affidavit
is
adequate,
because
you
can
always
cure
the
deficiency
if
the
defendant
asks
for
a
hearing.
and
at
that
hearing
you
can
cure
the
deficiency
and
you
can
then
keep
your
affidavit,
keep
your
prejudgment
attachment.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
no,
your
honor,
it
didn't.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--no,
your
honor.
i
am
responding
to
an
argument
that
the
state
used
here
that
the
supreme
court
says
the
affidavit
must
be
sufficient,
and
i
am
just
responding
to
the
argument
that
he
made
in
his
reply
brief
that
that
is
all
that
is
needed,
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
said
it
must
be
sufficient.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
your
honor.
i
can
defend...
i
believe
i
can
defend
the
court
below
on
alternate
grounds
other
than
what
the
court
below
ruled
on.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
indeed.
my
primary
position
here
is
that
there
is
no
advance
notice
to
a
defendant
before
his
home
is
attached
by
the
plaintiff.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
and
no
hearing.
no
notice,
no
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
no
bond--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
would
certainly
be
of
assistance,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
this
court
will
decide
that
a
bond
alone--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--my
position
is
that,
unless
there
are
very
unusual
circumstances,
the
defendant
should
have
an
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
case
to
the
judge
before
his
property
is
attached.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
i
think
a
lis
pendens
law
is
entirely
different,
your
honor,
and
that
is
because
a
lis
pendens
affects
a
particular
piece
of
property
that
is
an
issue.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
i
disagree,
your
honor,
because
in
mechanics
liens
statutes,
in
lis
pendens
statutes,
we
have
a
particular
piece
of
property
that
everybody
knows
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
have
adverse
claims
to,
so
that
in
effect
the
defendant
knows
somebody
is
going
to...
if
a
mechanics
lien,
for
instance,
is
put
on
the
property,
work
has
been
done
on
that
property
and
the
defendant
really
knows
that
somebody
has
another
interest
in
that
property.
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
an
emergency
circumstances
situation
because
a
particular
piece
of
property
is
unique.
you
don't
want
to
give
the
defendant
a
chance
to
transfer
it
out
from
under
somebody
else
who
has
a
claim
to
that
particular
piece
of
property.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
position.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
an
inchoate
lien
or
some
kind...
of
some
kind
exists.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that's
correct.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that's
correct.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
addition
this
court
asked
questions
about
the
possibility
of
recovery.
if
the
$75,000
attachment
in
this
case
turns
out
to
be
excessive,
but
digiovanni
wins
the
case,
there
is
no
recovery
for
a
attachment
that
is
wrongful
because
it
is
excessive.
the
only
possible--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--the
case
law
views
that
a
wrongful
attachment
is
only
wrongful
if
it
is
completely
dissolved
and
not
if
it
is
only
partially
dissolved.
and
justice
o'connor
asked
a
question
about
the
90-day
time
work...
time
frame
between
getting
the
attachment
and
notifying
the
defendant.
that
is
a
distinct
possibility
under
our
statute.
the
plaintiff
can
get
an
attachment,
put
it
on
the
land
records,
and
sit
on
it
for
up
to
90
days
before
he
notifies--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
was,
the
attachment
was
served
on
the
defendant
within
about
3
days
of
the
time
it
was
issued.
however,
the
time
frame
in
which
it
was
served
was
a
month
before
this
defendant
could
do
anything
about
it.
we
have
a
practice
book
rule
in
connecticut,
practice
book
114,
which
says
that
motions
and
pleadings
shall
commence
upon
the
return
date.
in
this
case
my
client
was
served
1
month
before
the
return
date,
and
he
could
not,
under
our
rules
of
practice,
make
any
motion
until
the
return
date
came
along.
the
defendant,
it
is
interesting--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--he
could
move
for
a
hearing
on
that
date,
he
could
file
an
answer,
he
could
do
any
number
of
things,
but
he
couldn't
do
it
before
the
return
date.
he
could
move
to
substitute
a
bond
so
he
could
avoid--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--under
the
practice
book
rule
114,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
unless
he
brought
a
separate
action
or
an
order
to
show
cause
at
additional
expense,
in
which
case
he
would
get
a--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--no,
your
honor,
it's
just
on
the
face
of
our
practice
and
procedure.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
it
is
the
first
day
upon
which
a
response
may
be
filed.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
the
clerk
might
accept
pleadings,
but
the
other
party
could
say
this
is...
should
be
stricken
from
the
record
because
it
was
not
properly
filed.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
there
is
a
time
frame
that
could
go
as
long
as
a
year
or
two,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
it
is
not
like
in
federal
court.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
we
have
a
separate
statute
which
says
that
the
pleadings
are
governed
by
rules
of
practice
established
by
the
judicial
department,
and
their
practice
book
is
the
rules
of
practice
established
by
the
judicial
department.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
i
do
not,
your
honor.
it
didn't
come
up
until
defendant's
reply...
petitioners'
reply
brief,
your
honor.
a
defendant
can
get
an
attachment
on
a
plaintiff's
property
after
the
lawsuit
is
begun
in
connecticut
if
the
defendant
asserts
a
counterclaim
or
set-off.
but
when
the
defendant
wants
an
attachment
he
has
to
give
notice
to
the
plaintiff
and
he
has
to
give
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
to
the
plaintiff
before
he
can
get
a
counter-attachment.
as
this...
as
justice
souter
and
scalia
were--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--it
just
shows
that
a
hearing
and
notice
before
an
attachment
is
eminently
practicable,
and
ordinarily
this
court
has
not
dispensed
with
a
prior
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
unless
there
were
emergency
circumstances,
unless
the
attachment
were
random
and
unauthorized
and
an
advance
hearing
was
not
practicable.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
could
be,
your
honor,
except
that
i
think
a
real
estate
attachment
is
very
significant,
and
that
is
because...
for
several
reasons.
most
people
have
first
mortgages
or
second
mortgages
on
their
homes
which
have
an
insecurity
clause.
so
that
once
an
attachment
is
put
on
a
person's
property
he
is
in
technical
default
under
an
insecurity
clause
and
he
could
be
driven
to
the
wall
by
a
foreclosure
on
his
property.
he
is
put
in
an
impaired
adversary
position,
he
is
kind
of
down
one
if
the
negotiations
over
settlement
begin.
it
is
immediately
put
on
his
credit
record
and
it
stays
there
for
7
years,
interfering
with
his
credit
opportunities.
and
one
of
the
important
things
about
giving
advance
notice
is
that
it
gives
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
avoid
all
of
these
consequences.
in
the
peralta
case
which
this
court
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago,
the
defendant
hadn't
gotten
notice
of
the
lawsuit
and
he
wanted
to
reopen
the
judgment,
but
he
didn't
have
a
good
defense.
and
one
of
the
arguments
was
that,
well,
it
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
even
if
you
had
gotten
notice.
and
this
court
said
no,
because
you
could
have
negotiated,
you
could
have
made
other
arrangements.
in
this
case,
advance
notice
might
give
an
opportunity
to
escrow
an
amount
instead
of
having
his
property
attached,
or
to
enter
into
an
agreement
not
to
sell
or
mortgage
during
the
course
of
the
lawsuit.
so
there
is
some
value
in
having
some
advance
notice,
because
it
gives
you
an
opportunity
to
avoid
the
harsh
consequences
of
attachment.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
as
a
practical
matter?
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
in
this
case
they
certainly
didn't.
the
assault
and
battery
was
3
days
before
the
lawsuit
was
begun.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
when
a
real
estate
attachment
is
available,
they
go
and
get
it,
and
then
they
start
talking,
your
honor.
that...
that
is...
that
is
the
300
or
400
cases
per
week
in
which
attachments
were
granted
before
the
second
circuit
decision
below.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
in
grant
there
were
also
emergency
circumstances.
there
was
a
preexisting
interest
in
property
which
the
defendant
could
destroy.
there
was
a
double
bond
to
compensate
the
defendant
for
humiliation,
embarrassment,
attorneys'
fees,
and
whatever.
so
that
i
think
there
were
a
number
of
factors
in
grant
which
are
not
present
in
this
case.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
no,
your
honor,
there
are
circumstances--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--that
is
correct.
certainly,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
that
is
on
the
factors
in
this
case,
and
there
may
be
other
cases
in
which
a
prompt
post-deprivation
hearing
would
be
appropriate.
another
problem
in
connecticut
law
is
that
the
post-deprivation
hearing
is
not
necessarily
prompt.
most
states
which
have
post-deprivation--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--practice
book
114
says
pleadings
and
motion
shall
start
on
the
return
date.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
without
citing
any
authority
for
that
proposition,
your
honor.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
no,
your
honor.
among
the
factors
that
this
court
considers
in
whether...
how
much
of
a
pre-deprivation
hearing
is
due
are
the
government
interests,
the
private
interest,
and--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--that
is
outside
the
record,
your
honor,
but
the
answer
is
no.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
i
am
not
sure
what
it
means,
your
honor.
you
can
appear
at
any
time
after
the
lawsuit
is
filed
against
you,
it
is
just
that
you
can't
file
motions.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
i
am
not
counsel
in
the
state
court
action.
the
government
interest
in
this
case
seems
particularly
tenuous.
in
fact
the
government
has
not
argued
that
it
has
any
interest
in
maintaining
this
ex
parte
procedure.
it
is
only
myself
and
the
amici
who
have
posited
some
possible
government
reasons
here.
but
it
seems
to
me
important
that
the
judicial
system
be
deemed
impartial
by
a
person
who
is
called
before
the
court,
and
that
image
of
impartiality
is
certainly
shattered
when
behind
the
defendant's
back
there
is
an
attachment
on
his
real
property
before
he's
had
a
chance
to
come
into
court.
the
private
interests,
of
course,
the
plaintiff
has
an
interest
in
securing
any
eventual
judgment,
but
studies
in
the
state
of...
one
study
in
the
state
of
connecticut
shows
that
a
potential
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
is
a
possibility
in
about
1.5
percent
of
the
cases.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
accept
that
a
lis
pendens
or
a
mechanics
lien
statute
would
be
constitutional
without
a
prior
hearing
because
it
does
involve
a
particular
piece
of
property
and
a
dispute
over
that
property,
which
could
be
conveyed
with
advance
notice.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
lis
pendens
is
only
when
there
is
a
dispute
over
title.
for
instance
a
husband
and
wife
who
are
divorcing
will
commonly,
one
of
them
will
commonly
file
a
lis
pendens--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--yes,
your
honor.
a
person
who
is
foreclosing
on
a
piece
of
property
would
file
a
lis
pendens.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
you
have
to
have
a...
some
kind
of
preexisting
interest
in
the
property.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
right.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
well,
he
has
an
interest
in
enforcing
his
judgment.
he
has
no
more
interest
in
the
property,
certainly--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--right.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that's
correct.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
this
court
has
never
dispensed
with
some
type
of
prior
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
unless
there
were
emergency
circumstances,
or
unless
the
defendant
had
substantial
input
into
the
decision-making
process,
as
in
mathews
v.
eldridge.
the
person
had
a
substantial
paper
input
before
the
deprivation
occurred.
that
is
not
what
happens
in
this
case.
i
think
the
attachment
of
$75,000
worth
of
equity
in
mr.
doehr's
property,
which
put
that
equity
beyond
reach
for
a
loan,
put
his
property
in
a
position
where
it
could
not
be
sold,
is
every
bit
as
significant
as
the
$35
in
wages
that
was
attached
in
sniadach.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
again,
that
is
outside
the
record,
but
it
is
still
pending
in
the
state
court,
and
mr.
doehr
has
filed
a
counterclaim
against
digiovanni.
i
believe
the
$65,000--
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
--i
would
say
anywhere
from
4
years
to
non-jury
to
7
years
for
a
jury
trial,
and
this
is
a
jury
trial.
the
attachment
here
is
every
bit
as
significant
as
the
$23
hobby
kit
which
was
given
due
process
protections
in
parratt.
it
is
every
bit
as
significant
as
the
personal
letters
and
mementos
in
hudson,
which
was
given
due
process
protection.
we
have
in
connecticut
an
established
state
procedure,
a
foreseeable
deprivation,
and
an
eminently
practicable
opportunity
to
have
pre-deprivation
notice
and
hearing.
i
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
ms.
joanne
s.
faulkner
yes,
your
honor.
