justice
scalia
excuse
me--
justice
scalia
--are
you
sure
that
it
is
clear
from
connecticut
law
that
it
means
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
win?
it
just
doesn't
mean
that
it's
a
valid
lawsuit
and
not
a
frivolous
lawsuit?
justice
scalia
gee,
it
doesn't,
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
in
the
context
in
which
we
are
most
familiar
with
that
phrase,
that
is
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
search.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
you
are
more
likely
than
not
to
find
what
you
are
looking
for.
you
just
have
to
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
it's
there.
but
here
you
say
that
it
means
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
win?
justice
scalia
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
could
you
give
us
a
citation
that
shows
that
it's
a
more
likely
than
not--
justice
scalia
well,
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
your
earlier
answer?
earlier
you
said
that
you
are
entitled
to
double
damages
if
you
lose
the
suit.
why
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
losing
the
entire
suit?
well,
i
did
lose,
but
in
fact
i
was
in
good
faith.
and
it
turned
out
that
i
lost,
but
at
the
time,
beforehand,
it
looked
more
likely
than
not
that
i
wouldn't
lose.
do
you
want
to
change
your
earlier
answer?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
it--
justice
scalia
--well,
i
am
sure
they
are
all
important.
but
as
i
understand
what
you
say
the
law
is
in
connecticut,
if
you
are
wrong
because
you
have
asked
for
too
many
damages,
you're
only
liable
if
it
wasn't
in
good
faith.
but
if
you're
wrong
because
you
thought
you
had
a
valid
lawsuit,
but
in
fact
it's
worthless,
good
faith
doesn't
count
for
that.
you
can
get
socked
for
double
damages
simply
because
you
lost
the
suit.
is
that--
justice
scalia
--but
you
have
said
it
already.
justice
scalia
so
you
can
defend
against
the
double-damage
lawsuit
so
long
as
your
initial
submission
was
in
good
faith.
is
that--
justice
scalia
--okay.
justice
scalia
mr.
cohn,
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
your
statement
at
the
outset
that
the
judge
makes
a
determination
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
plaintiff
will
win.
the
judge
doesn't
evaluate
the
truth
of
what
the
plaintiff
asserts,
does
he?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
he
takes
all
these...
so,
don't
you
have
to
modify
that
statement?
isn't
all
the
judge
determines
at
most
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
if
what
the
plaintiff
says
is
true,
the
plaintiff
will
win?
justice
scalia
assuming
that
everything
the
plaintiff
says
is
true.
justice
scalia
but
he
makes
no
evaluation
as
to
whether
that...
this
plaintiff
could
be
a
thorough
liar.
correct?
justice
scalia
and
he
makes
no
inquiry
into
that
at
all.
justice
scalia
so
it's
not
really
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
he'll
win,
but
rather
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
if
he
isn't
a
liar
he'll
win.
it's
a
big
difference.
justice
scalia
mrs.
faulkner,
in
the...
in
the
lis
pendens
situation
there
is
another
distinction
too,
isn't
there,
and
that
is
that
the
lien
at
least
allegedly
already
exists.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
the
basis
of
the
lawsuit--
justice
scalia
--that
i
have
a
lien,
and
i
am
just
asking
the
court
to
affirm
it.
justice
scalia
whereas
this
action
is
what
creates
the
lien.
justice
scalia
there's...
there's
no
even
arguable
claim
that
any
lien
exists.
justice
scalia
is
there
some
authority
for
that?
justice
scalia
mrs.
faulkner,
is
your
position
that
there
has
to
be
a
pre-attachment
hearing?
that
a
prompt
post-attachment
hearing
is
inadequate?
i
thought
we
have
said
that
a
prompt
post-attachment
hearing
would
be
enough
in
grant.
justice
scalia
but
you're,
you're
not
insisting
that
there
absolutely
must
be
a
pre-attachment
hearing?
justice
scalia
if
there
are
certain
other
things,
perhaps
a
bond,
perhaps
the
necessity
of
emergency
circumstances,
or
so
forth,
you
might
be
able
to
get
one
without
a
hearing,
constitutionally?
justice
scalia
--well,
of
course
even
in
that
case,
even
though
you
can't
say
the
plaintiff
claims
that
he
has
an
interest,
you
can
claim
that
he
is
asserting
that
the
purported
owner
of
the
property
does
not
have
an
interest.
if
he
claims
it
has
been
transferred
in
fraud
of
creditors
he
claims
the
transfer
is
invalid,
and
therefore
the
person
who
claims
title
really
doesn't
have
it.
justice
scalia
so
i
think
in
all
these
lis
pendens
cases
you
may
be
correct
that
at
least
what
is
at
issue
is
it
is
not
conceded
that
the
other
person
is
the
owner
of
the
property,
and
i
want
to
get
a
lien
on
it.
rather,
it's
a
dispute
over
whether
it
is
yours
or
mine.
