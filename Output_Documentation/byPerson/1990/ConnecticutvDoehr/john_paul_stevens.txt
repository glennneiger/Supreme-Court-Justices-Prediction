justice
stevens
mr.
cohn,
before
you
go
on
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understood
one
of
your
answers.
in
this
case
is
it
not
correct
that
the
attachment
was
obtained
before
there
was
any
notice
to
the
owner
of
the
real
estate?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
but
that
means
that
the
party
had
the
right
to
come
in
and
seek
to
have
the
attachment
set
aside.
justice
stevens
but
the
attachment
was
already
in
place
before
there
was
any
notice?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
at
least
it
preceded
the
notice.
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
right.
i
just
wondered.
justice
stevens
but
there
would
be
the
same
cause
of
action,
but
if
the
plaintiff
in
the
original
case
was
in
good
faith
and
believing
the
damages
would
be
over
$100,000,
there'd
be
no
recovery,
would
there?
justice
stevens
yeah.
i
think
you
may
have
given
inconsistent
answers.
is
it
a
question
of
whether
the
plaintiff
is
simply
in
good
faith
in
filing
the
lawsuit
and
asserting
a
claim
for
$100,000,
or
is
it
a
question
of
whether
he
actually
recovers
that
amount?
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
one
quick
question?
justice
stevens
how
do
they
get
the
$75,000
on
a
$15,000
ad
damnum?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
factual
basis
for
the
$75,000?
is
there
anything,
or
is
that
just
a--
justice
stevens
--just
picked
out
of
the
air?
