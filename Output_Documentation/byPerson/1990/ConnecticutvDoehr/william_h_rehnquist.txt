chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-143,
connecticut
and
john
f.
digiovanni
v.
brian
k.
doehr.
mr.
cohn.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
i--
--mr.
cohn,
what
does
that
mean
in
the
context
of
a
case
like
this
to
say
that
it's
a
facial
challenge?
i
mean,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
first
amendment
situation
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no
evidence
was
taken
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
in
this
particular
case
notice
was
served
immediately
upon
the
debtor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
one
difference,
in
many
states,
and
i
believe
this
was
true
where
i
practiced
in
arizona,
is
that
a
lis
pendens
can
be
sought
only
where
you
are
bringing
an
action
that
somehow
affects
the
land
on
which
you
want
the
lis
pendens,
whereas
an
attachment,
you
can
seek
that
on
property
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
is
that
true
in
connecticut
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
i
am
the
plaintiff.
i
file...
i
file
a
lawsuit
for
$100,000.
i
file
an
attachment
on
the
piece
of
property
for
$100,000.
i
recover
only
$50,000
in
the
lawsuit.
the
superior
court
judge
finds
nonetheless
i
was
in
good
faith
in
seeking
$100,000.
is
there
any
recovery
against
me
as
the
attacher?
chief
justice
rehnquist
really,
the
complaint
survives
a
motion
to
dismiss.
isn't
that
about
what
it
boils
down
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cohn.
mrs.
faulkner,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
faulkner,
when
you
say
reasons
for
the
attachment,
you
mean
something
like
the
defendant
is
liable
to
leave
the
jurisdiction,
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
sort
of
a
showing
of
necessity
for
an
attachment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
in
fact
defend
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
did
rule
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
no
hearing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
your
view,
ms.
faulkner,
one
could
have
had
the
most
elaborate
affidavit
in
the
world
here,
sworn
to
by
20
bishops,
in
effect,
and
still,
without
a
prior
notice
and
a
prior
hearing,
it
still
would
be
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what...
the
return
date
was
the
date
upon
which
your
client
could
ask
for
a
hearing
if
he
so
desired?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
he
had
notice,
but
he
was
unable
to
take
any
steps
to
defeat
the
attachment
before
the
return
date?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
was
that
all
in
evidence
before
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
don't
settlement
negotiations
of
some
sort
usually
precede
a
lawsuit
in
connecticut?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
are
there
no
discussions
between
attorneys
before
a
lawsuit
is
filed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
either
of
the
lower
courts
make
any
finding
on
that
point
as
to
whether
a
relatively
prompt
or
immediate
hearing
was
available?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
faulkner,
how
do
you
distinguish,
if
you
want
to
distinguish,
the
williams
against
bartlett
summary
affirmance
here
on
the
lis
pendens
statute?
on
the
grounds
that
the
lis
pendens
is
different
from
the
attachment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
a
claim
that
the
property
has
been
transferred
in
fraud
of
creditors?
does
that
support
a
lis
pendens?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
can
you
really
say
that
the
person
has
a
preexisting
interest
in
that
situation?
i
mean,
the
lawsuit
is
designed
to
produce
that
result,
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
does
a
person...
does
the
person
who
is
suing
to
set
aside
a
fraudulent
transfer
have
an
interest
in
the
property?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
but
that's
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
saying
he
has
a
preexisting
lien,
i
don't--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
faulkner.
mr.
cohn,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohn.
mrs.
faulkner,
would
you
submit
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
by
wednesday
noon
the,
a
copy
of
the
practice
rule
to
which
you
refer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
