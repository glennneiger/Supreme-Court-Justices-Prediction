mr.
henry
s.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
connecticut's
ex
parte
attachment
of
real
estate
statute
which
provides
for
an
immediate
post-seizure
hearing
and
a
pre-attachment
probable
cause
determination
by
a
state
court
judge
on
a
factual
affidavit
and
an
immediate
appeal
subsequent
to
the
post-seizure
clearing
satisfies
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
your
honors,
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute,
and
i
say
this
because
it
was
noted
in
the
opening
paragraph
of
judge
pratt's
opinion
for
the
second
circuit
and
was
so
noted
in
all
the
papers
and
opinions
below.
it
arose
on
summary
judgment--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--yes,
your
honor,
the
evidence
before
the
court
was
limited,
and
therefore
matters
such
as
the
effect
on
the
debtor
and
the
length
of
time
it
takes
to
obtain
a
hearing,
the
post...
the
immediate
post-seizure
hearing,
things
of
that
nature,
were
not
developed
in
the
district
court.
and
therefore
we're
dealing
with
the
statutes...
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
or
system
which
leads
to
the
ex
parte
real
estate
attachment,
and
there
are
cases
which
have
interpreted
that
in
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
and
that
is
what
is
before
you
today.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no,
there
were
two
facts
presented
in
the
trial
court
on
summary
judgment.
under
the
local
rule
in
order
to
have
summary
judgment
you
have
to
have
a,
what
they
call
a
list
of
material
facts,
and
there
were
two
facts
presented.
one
was
that
a
lawsuit
had
commenced
in
a
court
in
connecticut,
a
superior
court,
concerning
an
assault
and
battery.
and
the
other
was
that
in
fact
this
attachment
scheme
or
system
had
in
fact
been
used.
so
there
were
those
two
facts,
and
those
two
facts
alone,
and
they
were
the
basis
of
the
ruling.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
oh,
yes,
indeed,
your
honor,
that
was
the
case.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
well--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--it
was
applied
to
these
parties,
but
the
case
that
came
before
the
district
court
was
not
based
upon
the
factual--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--that's
right.
and
in
that
sense
they
had
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
something
had
happened
in
the
superior
court
below,
yes,
that
certain
steps
had
been
taken.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
in
fact
in
an
amendment
to
the
statute,
maybe
3
or
4
years
ago,
it
did
more
than
just
require
a
service,
which
you
would
normally
have
with
a
lawsuit.
they
also
took...
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
connecticut
added
to
the
statute
a
requirement
that
in
bold
print
every
debtor
or
landowner
that
was
affected
by
these
attachments
would
receive
a
list
of
rights
that
they
had
that
they
could
exercise.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
it's
at
the
time
a
complaint
is
served.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
the
90-day--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--technically
speaking
that
is
true.
we
would
contest,
however,
that
that
is
ever
done.
and
we
would
also
concede
that,
if
such
a
procedure
were
shown
to
exist,
there
might
be
some
due
process
problems.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
oh,
yes,
absolutely.
yes.
the
normal
procedure
is
that
the
creditor
or
the
attaching
party
would
immediately
get
the
paper
served
upon
the
debtor,
and
then
that
notice
would
be
included
with
the
packet
of
papers.
now,
there
would
be
no
harm
in
addition
to
the
debtor
if
there
was
no
notice
by
him
of
this
90-day
period.
but
again,
we're
talking
about
very
much
theoretical
goings
on
that
does
not
happen
under
this
scheme
as
it's
set
up.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
a
action
started
within
2
or
3
days
after
the
creditor
or
the
attaching
party
obtained
permission
from
the
district...
from
the
superior
court,
and
they
immediately
took
steps
to
both
accomplish
the
attachment
and
to
serve
the
papers
on
the
homeowner.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
oh,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
we
do.
and
how
does
that
differ
from
this?
lis
pendens
differs
actually
because
it
gives
somewhat
less
rights
than
this
statute
does
in
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
lis
pendens
there
is
no
need
to
go
to
the
superior
court
judge
and
to
demonstrate
the
affidavit,
in
factual
affidavit
that
we
have
in
this
case.
one
merely
starts
the
suits,
puts
the
lis
pendens
on
the
land
records,
then
gives
notice
to
the
debtor,
and
the
debtor
then
has
the
opportunity
to
go
to
the
superior
court
to
state
that
that
was
an
improper
service.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
lis
pendens
statute
of
connecticut
was
approved
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court
in
williams
v.
bartlett,
and
it
was
appealed
to
this
court,
and
this
court
summarily
affirmed
the
lis
pendens
statute.
and
the
question
presented
to
the
court,
this
court,
was
whether
or
not
this
violated
due
process.
and
again,
it
was
summarily
affirmed.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
i
believe
it
is
true.
yes,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
the
attachment
was
obtained
without
notice--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--however,
then
the
party
started
the
lawsuit,
and
notice
and
attachment
were
given
at
the
same
time
as--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--that's
right.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
within
a
day
or
so.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
oh,
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
because
that's
why
it
is
an
ex
parte
procedure.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
our
point
is
that
this
statutory
scheme,
as
it
is
established
and
as
the
legislature
has
passed
it,
is
beyond
question,
as
one
district
court
said,
beyond
question
facially
constitutional.
respondent
in
this
court
has
sought
to
go
beyond
even
the
second
circuit,
which
made
some
factual
assumptions
based
upon
some
of
the
two
points
that
were
in
the
court
on
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
the
second
circuit
has
made
a
few
additional
assumptions
as
to
the
effect
of
a
real
estate
attachment.
but
now,
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
respondent
has
gone
beyond
this
and,
to
our
view,
if
this
attachment,
the
connecticut
attachment,
is
vitiated,
not
only
would
the
attachment
statutes
fall,
but
our
mechanics
lien
statutes
would
be
threatened,
lis
pendens
statutes
would
be
threatened
throughout
the
country,
and
even
attachments
after
hearing,
because
there
are
references
in
respondent's
brief
to
the
type
of
attachments
which
occur
after
hearing
as
being
violative
of
due
process
and
difficult
for
the
homeowner
to
sustain
and
causing
a
variety
of
economic
and
emotional
harm.
just
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts,
in
this
case,
in
order
for
the
attachment
to
take
place,
the
petitioner,
who
is
digiovanni,
had
to
present
to
the
district,
to
the
superior
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut
three
items:
an
application
for
pre-judgment
remedy,
which
we
call
pjr's
in
connecticut,
a
factual
sworn
affidavit
setting
forth
the
grounds
of
the
liability
and
the
nature
of
the
damages,
and
the
proposed
unsigned
summons
and
complaint
that
was
intended
to
be
served
on
the
respondent
door.
the
superior
court
judge
reviewed
the
above
papers
and
made
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
he
actually
had
to
read
through
these
papers.
it
was
not
just
a
matter
of--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--that
is
right.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
that's
right.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
that
is
right.
and
indeed
the
burden
is
still
on
the
attaching
creditor
if
the
hearing
is
sought.
the--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
we
would
say
that
the
probable
cause
standard
means
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
success
for
the--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--it
certainly
is
not
suspicion,
your
honor.
it
is
not...
i
would
concede
it
is
not
the
degree
that
a
high
level
of
success,
but
it
is
the--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--that's
right.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
well,
i
would
rely
on
the
connecticut
fermont
case,
fermont
v.
smith,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
that
describes
the
nature.
and
also
there
is
this
case
which
is
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
glans
v.
testa.
this
is
the
reply
brief
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
which
discusses
the
nature
of
the
proof--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--well,
the
remedy
is
there
in
any
event,
and
they'd
have
to--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--that
is
right.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
most
states
have
that,
but
we
have
precedent
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
it
is
not
just
a
bond
which
is
necessary.
there
must
be
some
protection
for
the
attached
party,
for
the
homeowner.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
however,
that
does
not
always,
in
our
view,
have
to
be
accomplished
by
a
bond.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
that
and
the
right
to
sue
if
the...
if
there
has
been
a
wrongful
attachment.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
that
is
true,
but--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
and
i
can
only
say
that
the
due
process
clause
would
seem
to
allow
the
state
to
decide
under
what
circumstances
it
would
grant
security,
and
it
has
not
gone
as
far
as
that.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
then
the...
that
is
just
a
contingency.
in
other
words,
if
the--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--certainly.
there
would
be
a...
that
same
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
attachment.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
probably
not.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
is
in
good
faith,
because
he
has
to
make
a
judgment
at
the
time
when
he
commences
his
lawsuit
as
to
what
the
possible
outcome
will
be
and
what
security
he
needs.
there
is
one
other
factor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
i
would
say
no.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no,
i
don't.
i'd
say
that--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--there's
a
separate
suit
which
is
brought
after
the
initial
lawsuit
is
over
in
the
superior
court,
and
when
that
separate
suit
comes
up
all
these
factors
become
important
in
deciding
whether
there
is
a
recovery
or
not.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--i
apologize
to
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
what
happens
is
that
the
remedy
is
there
to
protect
the
party
that
goes
beyond
what
is
required
in
the
lawsuit
and
seeks
more
than
is
necessary,
or
takes
action
which
is
just
plain
not
justified
by
the
action
in
question.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
and
in
addition,
your
honor,
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
the
judge
in
here.
there
is
also
the
factor
of
the
judge,
because
as
the
connecticut
procedure
works,
all
these
papers
go
before
the
judge.
and
the
superior
court
judge...
and
again,
this
is
a
facial
challenge
and
we
haven't
shown
any
reason
why
the
superior
court
would
not
do
this.
the
superior
court
would
screen,
and
does
in
fact
screen
these
attachments
to
make
sure
that
the
amount
of
the
damages
fits
the
amount
of
the...
or
the
nature
of
the
liability.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
actually,
i
think
your
honor
should
look
at
the
full
affidavit,
which
is
on
page
24a
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
will
show
you
the
entire...
there
have
been
some
things
clipped
out
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
well,
just
a
bit
more
about
what
the
damages
were.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
i
would
say
that
it
is
the
bare
bones,
your
honor.
i
have
seen
a
lot
more
detailed
than
this,
however--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--this
is...
this
was
enough
for
this
judge
to
pass.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
i
would
agree
that
the
judge
was
right.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
he
does
say
that
he
was
willfully,
wantonly,
and
maliciously
assaulted.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
there
is
one
other
point,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
he
also
has
the
complaint
in
front
of
him
as
well.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no,
it
supplements...
the
way
the
practice
works
is
that
it
supplements
the
affidavit
so
that
the
judges
look
both
at
the
affidavit
and
the
complaint.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no.
if
your
honor
pleases,
it's
on
page
30a.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
oh,
excuse
me.
no,
28a.
i'm
sorry.
it
is
28a.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
it
does
say
that
he
assaulted
the
plaintiff
and
beat
him
with
his
fists.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
in
this
case
i
would
admit
that
it
is
a
very
skeletal
affidavit.
however--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--no,
i
would
disagree.
i
would
say
that,
while
it's
a
skeletal
affidavit,
it
does
set
forth
enough
here
in
that
the
fists
allegation
is
there,
and
also
that
there
is
some
indication
of
the
nature
of
the
damages,
and
that
that
would
be
enough
for
a
judge
to
decide
in
an
assault
and
battery
case
that
a
attachment
would
be
warranted.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
he
looks
through
the
papers
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
there--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
well,
not
so
much.
i
would
say
that
he
gets
a
flavor
of
the
case
enough
to
allow
a
real
estate
attachment.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
to
allow
this
attachment
to
go
on
a
debtor's
property.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
your
honor,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
the
ad
damnum,
in
connecticut
the
way
it
works
is
you
list
the
minimum,
and
it
could
be
anything
higher
than
that.
it
has
to
do
with
how
much
money
you
paid
the
court.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
not
in
this
affidavit.
no.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
normally
in
an
affidavit
that
was...
that
would
meet
constitutional...
that
would
be
a
little
bit
better
than
what
we
have
got
here
today,
they
would
actually
put
down
money...
monetary
figures
and
show
exactly
how
they
arrived
at
that
figure.
they
didn't
do
it
here.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
your
honor,
they
relied
on
the
fact
that
you
had
the
right
to
sue
for
a
wrongful--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--two
felt
that
the
bond
was...
lack
of
bond
was
okay,
and
one
felt
that
it
was
not.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
your
honors,
i
think
i
should
respond
immediately
to
the
return
date
question
which
justice
white
had.
we
do
disagree,
as
you
point
out,
in
our
reply
brief
as
to
the
effect
of
this
return
date.
this
return
date
is
in
all
actions
and
has
to
do
with
when
one
has
to
appear
or
face
default
attachments
to
one's
side.
it
could
be
any
case
where
there
is
a
lawsuit
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant.
the
defendant
is
given,
on
the
papers
that
he
is
receiving,
an
indication
of
a
date,
a
cut-off
date
after
which
an
answer
must
be
filed
or
an
appearance
must
be
filed
in
the
state
court
or
he
risks
having
the
plaintiff
come
in
and
make
a
motion
to
default
for
failure
to
appear
and
then
take
judgment
against
him
if
that
is
granted.
but
that
does
not
impact
on
the
attachment
situation,
where
if
a
person
is
served
with
an
attachment
and
given
notice
that
he
may
immediately
appear,
there
is
no
reason
why,
indeed
there
is
no
legal
bar
under
the
rule
of
court,
to
have
that
party
go
to
the
clerk's
office,
present
the
motion
to
release
the
attachment,
and
have
the
process
started.
it
obviously
would
have
to
be
put
on
the
calendar,
and
that
would
take
a
week
or
two,
but
they're
not
going
to
throw
his
papers
out
or
refuse
to
honor
it,
or
anything
like
that.
so
the
return
date
is
a
red
herring,
in
our
opinion,
in
this...
in
this
matter.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
the
statute,
which
is
52.278(e)(c)
says
that
the
hearing
shall
be
expeditious,
and
the
fermont
case
says
that
it
should
be
immediate.
and
reading
the
statute
on
its
face
we
say
that
you
would
get
this
immediate
hearing,
and
the
6
months
would
be
a
total
violation
of
due
process,
and
we
would
concur.
but
that
wouldn't
happen--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--it
certainly
could
be.
in
the
fermont
case
itself
it
was
within
a
week
of
the
defendant
attached
party
asking
for
it.
he
received
his
hearing
right
away.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
in
the
fermont
case?
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
in
the
fermont
case--
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
--um,
i
believe
in
the
fermont
case,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
the
attachment
had
gone
on,
but
the
defendant
hadn't
asked
for
any
sort
of
hearing.
he
just
let
the
attachment
continue.
and
then
at
some
point
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
he
asked
for
a
hearing,
and
he
was
given
a
hearing
immediately,
1
week
later.
but
i
am
using
it
as
an
example
that
they
do
in
fact
give
immediate
hearings.
there
would
be
no
reason
under
the
world
why
the
courts
wouldn't
accommodate
what
the
statute
and
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
said,
that
it
should
be
an
immediate
hearing.
mr.
henry
s.
cohn
yes,
but
we
would
contest
that
that
is
the
situation
that
would
happen.
