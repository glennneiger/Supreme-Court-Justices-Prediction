justice
souter
mr.
cohn,
i
want
to
go
back
to
another
aspect
of
that
probable
cause
standard.
on
page
2
of
the
respondent's
brief
there
is
a
quotation
from
the...
i
guess
it
was
an
affidavit
submitted
in
this
particular
case.
are
you
familiar
with
that?
do
you
have
that
handy?
page
2,
the
first
full
paragraph.
justice
souter
was
anything
presented
to
the
judge
in
this
case
beyond
this
particular
affidavit?
justice
souter
what
has
been
clipped
out?
can
you
summarize
that
for
me
briefly?
justice
souter
well,
let's
go
to
the
issue
for
a
moment
of
the
likelihood
of
there
being
a
right
to
recovery
at
all.
is
the
affidavit
in
that
respect
as
set
out
here
representative
of
what
would
be
sufficient
under
connecticut
law?
justice
souter
this
is
enough
to
pass
muster?
justice
souter
well,
was
the
judge
right
or
wrong?
justice
souter
all
right.
what
this
provides...
what
this
contains
with
respect
to
the
right
to
recover,
leaving
aside
the
amount
of
damages,
is
simply
an
allegation
that
i
was
willfully,
wantonly,
maliciously
assaulted,
a
statement
that
the
assault
caused,
in
this
case,
a
broken
wrist
and
a
bruised
eye,
and
that
money
was
expended
for
treatment.
and
it
ends
up
with
a
statement,
in
my
opinion
the
foregoing
facts
are
sufficient
to
show
there
is
probable
cause
for
judgment.
what
does
that
tell
you
anything
more
than
the
fact
that
this
plaintiff
is
in
fact
making
a
claim,
and
professes
to
make
a
claim
in
good
faith,
that
he
has
a
right
to
recover?
justice
souter
yeah,
but
that
is
purely
conclusory.
that
is
not
a
factual
affidavit.
that
is
a
statement
of
conclusion.
and
i
don't
see
how...
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
i
don't
see
how
any
magistrate
passing
on
this
can
make
any
judgment
whatsoever
about
the
likelihood
of
success
or
even
the
likelihood
of
there
being
a
factual
basis
for
the
claim,
except
insofar
as
he
says,
well,
i
assume
this
fellow
in
front
of
me
or
signing
the
affidavit
is
doing
it
in
good
faith.
i
don't
see
how
he
can
get...
at
most
i
don't
see
how
he
can
get
beyond
a
judgment
that
the
action
is
at
least
being
brought
professedly
in
good
faith.
justice
souter
but
a
complaint
is
just
an
allegation,
isn't
it?
or
is
it
more
than
that
in
connecticut?
justice
souter
but
i
guess
i
come
back
to
the
question
what
does
the...
what
does
the
affidavit
really
do
beyond
repeat
or
summarize
in
a
conclusory
way
a
series
of
allegations?
justice
souter
but
if
this
is
enough
to
pass
muster,
then
a
judge
really
can
authorize
an
attachment
on
the
connecticut
law
without
being
in
a
position
to
make
any
judgment
whatsoever
about
the
probability
of
success.
isn't
that
true?
justice
souter
may
i
go
back
to
one...
one
further
issue
on
that?
does
the
return...
is
the
return
day
in
connecticut
law
the
day
upon
which,
or
the
last
day,
as
it
were,
upon
which
a
response
may
be
filed?
justice
souter
oh,
so
the
clerk
of
court
would
not
receive
or
would
not
accept
pleadings
prior
to
that
date?
justice
souter
they
would
have
no
legal
effect?
justice
souter
if
the
return
day
is
the
first
day,
what
is
the
last
day
upon
which
responsive
pleadings
can
be
filed?
justice
souter
i
see.
justice
souter
what
is
the
status
of
this
practice
handbook
that
you
refer
to?
i
raise
the
question
because
in
the
reply
brief
opposing
counsel
points
out
that
under
the
connecticut
statute
involved
there
is
no
indication
that
an
objecting
defendant
could
not
have
a
hearing
immediately,
even
before
the
return
date.
that...
so
i
ask
what
is
the
status
of
the
practice
handbook?
justice
souter
i
see.
do
you
quote
the
rules
of
practice
in
your
brief?
