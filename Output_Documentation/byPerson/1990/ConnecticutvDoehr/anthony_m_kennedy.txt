justice
kennedy
does
that
mean
that
there
is,
he
find
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits?
justice
kennedy
that
it's
more
probable
than
not--
justice
kennedy
--that
the
plaintiff
will
prevail?
justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that's
the
same
standard
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
meet
again
if
a
hearing
is
sought
after
the
attachment?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
it's
more
likely
than
not,
then
that's
sufficient
for
the
plaintiff
to
prevail
in
an
ordinary
civil
action,
i
take
it.
justice
kennedy
--and
that
holds
that?
justice
kennedy
well
then
if
the
plaintiff
does
not
prevail,
the
defendant
is
automatically
entitled
to
double
damages?
because
then
the
suit
had
been
commenced
without
probable
cause.
justice
kennedy
well,
the
remedy
is
that
you...
if
the
suit
is
commenced
without
probable
cause
you
get
double
damages.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
so
under
your
theory,
anytime
the
defendant
prevails,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
double
damages?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
only
protection
is
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
justice
kennedy
is
the
attachment
in
the
sum
certain?
$100,000?
justice
kennedy
and
if
the
damages
recovered
are
$50,000,
then
what?
justice
kennedy
well,
has
the,
has
the
defendant...
can
the
defendant
show
damages
and
recover
if
the
attachment
was
for
$100,000
but
the
amount
of
the
judgment
was
only
50?
justice
kennedy
well,
all
he
does
is
really
say
that
the
complaint
is
sufficient.
yeah.
justice
kennedy
so
you
disagree
with
him
that
the
standard
is
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
plaintiff
will
prevail?
justice
kennedy
--i
have
been
reading
the
fermont
case,
and
i
don't
see
any
reference
to
that
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
kennedy
that
seems
unfair,
but
does
that
illustrate
some
constitutional
proposition?
does
that--
justice
kennedy
can
you
give
us
any
indication,
i
am
sure
it
varies
from
case
to
case,
that,
how
long
it
takes
to
bring
a
suit
like
this
to
trial
in
connecticut,
assuming
diligence
on
all
sides?
