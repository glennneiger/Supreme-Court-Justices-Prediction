justice
blackmun
mr.
cohn,
may
i
take
you
all
the
way
back
to
the
bond,
the
absence
of
a
bond?
justice
blackmun
even
though
you
lost
below,
am
i
not
correct
that
two
of
the
judges
felt
that
this
was
of
no
consequence?
justice
blackmun
so
that
one
of
the
judges
in
the
majority
nevertheless
felt
the
bond
was
not
an
unconstitutional
absence,
so
to
speak?
