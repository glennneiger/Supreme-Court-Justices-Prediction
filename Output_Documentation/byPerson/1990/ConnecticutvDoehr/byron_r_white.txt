justice
white
well,
the
court...
the
court
below
didn't
deal
with
the
sufficiency
of
this
particular
affidavit,
did
it?
justice
white
did
they
invalidate
it
on
other
ground?
justice
white
and
are
you
defending
the
judgment
below
on
the
grounds
they
used?
justice
white
but
you
are
defending
the
reasons
that
the
court
below
gave?
justice
white
you
wouldn't
say
it
would
be
enough
to
give
him
notice
if
he
wasn't
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
attachment
went
on?
justice
white
well,
don't
you
think
the
court
below
held
that
there
had
to
be
a
pre-attachment
hearing?
justice
white
well,
so
you
say
that
an
immediate
post-attachment
hearing
would
not
be
sufficient?
justice
white
and
that
is
what
the
holding
was
below?
justice
white
you
and
your
opponent
disagree
on
whether
you
could
apply
before
the
return
date.
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
out
what
the
connecticut
law
is?
justice
white
your
opponent
says
that
you
can
apply
for
an
immediate
hearing.
justice
white
did
you
take
any
steps
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
the...
your
opponent
says,
"indeed
the
defendant
in
this
case
appeared
1
week
before
the
return
date,
even
though
he
chose
not
to
request
a
hearing.
"
what
does
that
mean?
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
opponent.
justice
white
well,
what
did
you
do?
was
there
an
appearance?
justice
white
but
the
plaintiff
who
gets
a
lis
pendens,
until
that...
until
he
get
it,
files
it,
he
has
no
interest
in
the
property.
he
has
no
right
to
interfere
with
any
element
or
the
ownership.
justice
white
well,
when
can
you
get
a
lis
pendens?
when
you
have
already
got
an
interest
in
the
property?
justice
white
well,
that's--
--i
don't
think
so.
is
that
the
only
situation
where
you
can
get
a
lis
pendens
in
connecticut?
justice
white
so
a
preexisting
interest
in
the
property?
justice
white
what's
the
status
of
the
assault
suit?
justice
white
what...
even
if
you
are
right
that
you
can
come
in
and
ask
for
a
hearing,
you
could
file
a
motion
for
a
hearing
right
away--
justice
white
--when...
there
is
no
guarantee
in
the
statute
or
anyplace
else
that
the
hearing
would
be,
would
be
given
within
a
particular
time?
it
might
be
a
week,
it
might
be
6
months.
justice
white
well,
where
is
the
provision
for
an
immediate
hearing?
justice
white
within
10
days?
justice
white
when
did
the
defendant
ask
for
it
in
that
case?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
how
soon
after
the
attachment?
justice
white
well,
it's
sort
of
inconsistent
with
the
requirement
for
an
immediate
hearing
to
say
that
under
the
rules
you
have
to
wait
20
days
before
you
can
even
ask
for
it.
justice

r.
white
