justice
o'connor
well,
it
was
applied
in
this
case,
was
it
not?
i
mean,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
connecticut
procedures
were
actually
invoked.
justice
o'connor
for
these
litigants.
so
one
couldn't
really
say
it's
a
facial
challenge.
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
o'connor
this
is...
it
has
been
applied
in
this
case
to
these
parties.
justice
o'connor
well,
summary
judgment
was
granted.
justice
o'connor
as
long
as
you're...
interrupted
me,
i
asked
you
one
thing
about
the
statute.
is
notice
given
immediately
to
the
landowner
when
the
lien
is
placed
on
the
property?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
the
notice
given
at
the
time
the
complaint
is
served
to
start
the
lawsuit,
or
is
there
some
other
notice
given?
justice
o'connor
so
that
could
be
a
90-day
period?
justice
o'connor
meaning
technically
someone
could
go
in
and
get
the
lien,
and
then
have
it
in
existence
and
serve
the
complaint
90
days
later?
justice
o'connor
do
we
know
in
this
case
whether
a
notice
was
received
right
away?
justice
o'connor
does
connecticut
have
a
lis
pendens
scheme--
justice
o'connor
--in
addition
to
this?
justice
o'connor
but
no
bond
or
security
is
required
under
connecticut
scheme.
justice
o'connor
do
most
states
that
have
a
pre-attachment
proceeding
like
this
require
a
bond
or
security
to
be
furnished?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
doesn't
do
any
good
if
the
person
who
makes
the
attachment
is
judgment
proof,
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
it
wouldn't
take
much
to
require
some
kind
of
security
to
be
furnished,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
is
the
complaint
the
one
found
on
28a
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
o'connor
what
is
the
complaint
on
28a?
justice
o'connor
and
what
does
that
add
to
the
affidavit?
justice
o'connor
so
beating
with
the
fists
is
what's
added?
justice
o'connor
that's
all?
but
also
the
amount
in
demant...
i
think
that
may
be
a
misprint
over
at
the
top
of
29a...
the
ad
damnum
clause,
the
complaint
contains
an
ad
damnum
clause
of
$15,000,
which
the
affidavit
did
not.
justice
o'connor
what
case
do
you
rely
on
that
we
might
look
at
from
connecticut
to--
justice
o'connor
and
if
a
bond
or
security
were
furnished,
would
that
overcome
any
constitutional
deficiency?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
position?
justice
o'connor
under
the
holding
of
the
court
which
we're
reviewing,
i
suppose
no
state's
lis
pendens
law
would
survive.
justice
o'connor
but
there
is
no
notice,
there's
no
advance
hearing.
i
assume
that
under
the
language
of
the
opinion
which
we
are
reviewing
that
all
these
laws
across
the
country
would
fail.
justice
o'connor
what
happened
in
this
case,
however?
justice
o'connor
--well,
of
course
the
real
estate
attachment
is
a
little
different
than
coming
in
and
seizing
someone's
wages
or
household
goods
and
carting
them
off.
justice
o'connor
because
the
homeowner
is
not
dispossessed
as
of
the
time
that
the
lien
goes
on.
so
perhaps
that
enters
into
the
balance,
or
what
process
is
due
under
the
constitutional
requirement
of
due
process.
it
may
well
be
different.
