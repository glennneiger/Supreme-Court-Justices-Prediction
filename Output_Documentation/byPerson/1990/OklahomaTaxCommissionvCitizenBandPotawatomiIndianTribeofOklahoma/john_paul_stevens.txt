justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
source
of
the
indian
tribal
immunity?
where
did
it
come
from?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
statutory.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that,
supposing
the
state
had
seized
a
shipment
of
cigarettes
destined
for
the
tribe
and
presumably
owned
by
the
tribe,
because
they
would
shipped
by
a
common
carrier
and...
the
property
would
presumably
pass
at
the
time
of
shipment.
and
the
tribe
brought
suit
and
said,
give
us
back
our
cigarettes.
we
have
sovereign
immunity
and,
therefore,
our
property
is
immune
from
seizure
of
this
kind.
how
would
you
decide
that
case?
justice
stevens
well,
then
what
remedy
does
the
state
have?
how
can
they
collect
their
tax?
i
thought
you
said
they
could
seize
cigarettes,
but
now
you
say
they
can't.
justice
stevens
but
they'll
still
lose
is
that
what's
you're
saying.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
they
could
have
done
with
the
same
result
is
the
problem
i
suppose.
