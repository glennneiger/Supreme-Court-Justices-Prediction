justice
o'connor
well,
now,
you
don't
assert
any
right
to
collect
taxes
for
sale
to
tribal
members,
i
trust?
justice
o'connor
you
assert
that
you
can
do
that
as
well?
yes,
i
believe
this
case
is
on--
justice
o'connor
but
the
land
on
which
this
store
is
located
is
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
the
tribe,
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
this
point
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
could
you
sue
the
store
manager?
justice
o'connor
to
require
the
manager
to
set
aside
the
money
and
do
what's
necessary?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
you
would
have
jurisdiction
to
go
after
the
employee
not
to
hold
him
liable
but
to
require
by
way
of
an
injunction
or
other
court
order
that
the
employee
set
aside
this
money
for
the
taxes?
justice
o'connor
mr.
kneedler--
--well,
mr.
kneedler,
it's
a
pretty
empty
right
to
be
able
to
tax
the
sales
if
there's
no
way
for
the
state
to
enforce
it.
what
can
the
state
do--
justice
o'connor
--really
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
o'connor
can
they
sue
and
get
some
kind
of
affirmative
injunction
against
the
manager
of
the
store
to
require
the
taxes
to
be--
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
minnis,
let's
say
that
we
follow
the
colville
case
and
the
solicitor
general's
position
and
that
we
agree
that
oklahoma
is
entitled
to
tax
the
transaction
of
sale
of
cigarettes
to
nonmembers
of
the
tribe...
that
that's
a
taxable
event
and
the
tribe...
the
state
can
require
the
tribe
collect
the
tax
and
pay
it
over.
now
is
the
tribe
willing
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
asked
though
suppose
we
take
the
view
that
the
solicitor
general
has
urged
here
that
these
transactions,
at
least
as
to
sales
to
nonmembers,
are
taxable.
justice
o'connor
where
does
that
leave
us?
justice
o'connor
there
have
been
sales
to
nonmembers,
apparently
substantial
sales
to
nonmembers
and
that
continues
to
this
day
i
understand.
justice
o'connor
now
let's
say
that
we
think
those
are
perfectly
taxable.
justice
o'connor
what's
to
be
done?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
not
very
hypothetical.
