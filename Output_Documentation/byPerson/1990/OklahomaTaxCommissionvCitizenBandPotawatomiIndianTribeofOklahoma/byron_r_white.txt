justice

on
sales
to
nonmembers.
justice
white
now,
would
you
claim
they
should
collect
it
on
sales
to
members,
too?
justice
white
xxx.
justice
white
but
the
sg
says
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
enjoining
you
from
collecting
the
tax.
justice
white
to
nonmembers.
justice
white
no,
the
sg,
the
solicitor
general,
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
enjoining
you
from
collecting
the
tax.
justice
white
all
right.
then
how
would...
let's
just
assume
that
the
sg
is
right
that
there
was
there
that
that
injunction
should
be
vacated...
the
injunction
enjoining
you
from
collecting
the
tax.
how
would
you
collect
it?
justice
white
you
can't...
you
can't...
under
the
sg's
view
the
tribe
is
immune
from
suit.
you
couldn't
sue
them.
how
would
you
collect
it?
justice
white
so
the
administrative
court
of
appeals
erred
in
entering
the
injunction
against
collecting
the
sales...
sales
tax
on
sales
to
nonmembers?
justice
white
i
guess
we
left
the
states
in
that
same
position
before.
justice
white
mr.
kneedler,
your
brief
says
the
question
of
what
remedies
the
state
might
have
should
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
well,
how
would
that
ever
be...
how
would
the
question
of
remedy
ever
be
up
in
the
courtroom?
justice
white
they
would
be
passing
on...
the
tribe
brought
the
suit,
wanted
the
injunction,
and
you
say,
well,
they
shouldn't
have
gotten
an
injunction.
justice
white
is
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
white
xxx
set
aside
that
injunction.
justice
white
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
necessarily
get
into
anything
about
remedy.
justice
white
they
would
leave
the
state
exactly
where
we
put
them
before,
wouldn't
they?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
assessment
was
for
sales
tax
that
should
have
been
withheld
and
wasn't.
justice
white
no.
well,
you
think
we
haven't
held
that
the
state
may
insist
on
the
tribe
withholding
sales
tax
on
sales
to
nonmembers?
justice
white
what
does
the...
what
do
you
mean
an
assessment?
all
they
did
was
write
them
a
letter,
didn't
they?
what
did
they
do?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
hear
you
say
an
assessment--
justice
white
--they
just
said,
please
pay
us
this
tax.
justice
white
well,
and
then
what
would
have
happened?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they...
what
would
they
have...
what
would...
wouldn't
have...
if
your
tribe
is
immune,
i
don't
know
how
they
could
have
sued
them
or
do
anything
else.
but
come
on
the
land
and
attach
the
store
or
what?
justice
white
you
know...
the
tribe
knows
what
the
law
is
about
what
the
sales
tax
law
is
and
you've
never
been
withholding
and
returning
the
tax.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
them.
justice
white
well...
it
couldn't
even
tax
sales
to
nonmembers
and
if
we
say
they
were
wrong
in
that,
i
suppose
we
would
reverse
them.
justice
white
i
take,
then,
it
wouldn't
bother
you
if
we
said
there
is
no
existing
injunction
against
the
state
from
collecting
sales
tax?
that's
what
you
say.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
enjoin
the
state
from
collecting
sales
tax
on
sales
to
nonmembers.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
we
hold
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
collect
sales
taxes
on
the
sales
by
nonmembers
and
that
the
tribe
should
have
been
withholding
those
taxes
and,
of
course,
if
they...
and
if
they...
of
course,
if
they
should
from
now
on
withhold,
they
should
have
withheld
it
in
past.
now
what's
wrong
with
the
state
saying,
writing
a
letter
and
saying,
look
you
should
be
withholding
and
you
haven't
been
withholding.
now
pay
us
what
you
haven't
withheld.
is
that
so
insulting?
justice
white
no,
but
the
state
says,
your
immunity
doesn't
cover
sales
to
nonmembers
and
cites
these
cases.
just
because
it's
called
a
tax
assessment
doesn't...
it
may
be
a
demand
to
pay,
because
you
haven't
been
withholding.
that's
all
it
was,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
well,
the
tribe
owns
the
store.
the
tribe's
the
one
that
should
have
been
withholding
taxes,
and
they
didn't
withhold.
justice
white
has
the
state
of
oklahoma
or
any
other
state
as
far
as
you
know
requested
congress
to
waive
tribal
sovereign
immunity
where
the
tribe
has
refused
to
pay...
to
collect
sales
taxes
and
to
turn
them
over--
justice
white
--what
do
you
mean
it
isn't
in
a
position
to
do
that?
justice
white
but
they're
concerned
with
the
status
of
indian
tribes.
