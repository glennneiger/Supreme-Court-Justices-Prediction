it's
an
area
where
that's
exactly
what
you
ought
to
do.
i
think
it's
amazing
that
the
states
haven't
gone
to
congress
and
said,
look,
we
have
a
problem
collecting
these
taxes.
we're
entitled
to
get
them,
no
we
need
relief
from
you
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
to
that
extent.
i
would
suggest
that
that's
a
perfectly
valid
position
for
the
states.
