chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1322,
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
citizen
band
potawatomi
indian
tribe
of
oklahoma.
mr.
miley,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
our
mcgowan
case
say
that
lands
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
the
indians
have
much
the
same
status
as
reservation
lands?
chief
justice
rehnquist
here
there's
no
resident
tribal
population?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
this
court
isn't
bound
by
any
ruling
of
the
tenth
circuit--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--as
witness
to
the
fact
we've
got
this
case
here
on
certiorari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
miley.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
it
was
this
court
that
first
created
tribal
sovereign
immunity,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
an
act
of
congress.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
minnis,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
certainly
went
further--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
said
the
injunction
should
cover
not
merely
the
sale
of
cigarettes
to
tribal
members
but
to
nonmembers
because
of
its
analysis
of
public
law
280.
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
assessing
the
tax
on
sales
to
nonmembers
or
to
members
or
to
both?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we're
playing
with
words
to
a
certain
extent.
do
you
agree
on
behalf
of
your
client
with
the
court
of
appeals
position
that
public
law
280
means
that
the
colville
and
moe
cases
and
their
doctrines
do
not
apply
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
perhaps
the
tribe
is
liable.
if
it
should
have
been
collecting
a
sales
tax
on
sales
to
nonmembers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
moe
and
colville
said
that
montana
and
washington
state
tax
laws
were
applicable
to
the
tribes
who
were
involved
in
those
lawsuits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minnis.
mr.
miley,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
of
them
is
89-1322,
oklahoma
tax
commission
versus
the
citizen
band
of
potawatomi
indian
tribe
of
oklahoma.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
arose
out
of
a
dispute
between
the
state
and
the
tribe
over
the
latter's
obligation
to
collect
taxes
on
cigarettes
sold
on
the
reservation.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
tribe
was
immune
from
suit
under
this
court's
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
therefore,
it
ruled
that
oklahoma's
counterclaims
were
properly
dismissed,
and
that
oklahoma
could
not
require
the
tribe
to
collect
and
remit
taxes
on
cigarette
sales
that
occur
on
the
reservation.
in
a
decision
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
we
find
that
the
tribe
did
not
wave
its
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
merely
by
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
proposed
assessment.
we
affirm
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
however,
as
we
have
stated
in
several
prior
cases,
sovereign
immunity
does
not
deprive
a
state
of
the
authority
to
tax
cigarette
sales
to
non-members
of
a
tribe
at
a
tribal
store.
in
two
prior
decisions,
we
have
held
that
the
tribe
has
an
obligation
to
assist
in
the
collection
of
validly
imposed
state
taxes
on
such
sales.
we,
therefore,
reverse
that
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
enjoins
oklahoma
from
collecting
taxes
on
sales
to
non-members
of
the
tribe.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
