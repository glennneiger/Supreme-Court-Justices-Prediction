mr.
michael
minnis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tribe
has
an
entirely
fundamentally
different
perspective
on
this
case
and
how
it
arose.
this
case
did
not
arose
under
any
fact
similarities
to
moe
v.
colville
or
any
of
the
other
cases.
this
case
was
a
simple
case
in
the
court
below,
at
least
it
began
that
way.
it
was
a
proposed
tax
assessment.
this
is
not
a
case
of
collection.
it's
a
case
of
a
direct,
proposed
tax
assessment
against
the
tribe.
the
tribe
sought...
in
filing
suit
sought
one
remedy
and
one
remedy
only
and
that
was
to
enjoin
that
proposed
tax
assessment.
and
to
this
date,
and
we
haven't
heard
it
here
today
because
they've
been
all
talking
about
moe
v.
colville.
we
have
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
may
tax
an
indian
tribe
and
they
have
no
authority
then
what
they
were
proposing
to
do
was
to
take
an
action
that
was
clearly
illegal.
mr.
michael
minnis
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
different.
if
you're
immune
from
tax,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not--
mr.
michael
minnis
--yes,
sir,
you
have
held
in
certain
cases
that
in
certain
states
that
the
state
may
require
indian
tribes
to
cooperate,
and
if
they
don't
cooperate
they're
not
entitled
to
injunctive
relief.
but
you
have
never
held,
at
least
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
that
an
indian
tribe
can
be
directly
taxed
by
the
state.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
prior
collection
or
what
have
you.
it
was
simply
a
raw,
direct
tax
assessment,
$2.6
million,
that
would
have
had
to
have
been
paid
by
the
tribe,
not
from
any
precollection
or
any
prior...
arrangement.
mr.
michael
minnis
your
honor,
the
writing
of
that
letter
is
a
very
critical--
mr.
michael
minnis
--i
proposed
assessment.
mr.
michael
minnis
and
in
30
days
if
we
had
not
filed
a
protest
with
the
state,
the
tax
would
have
been
filed.
mr.
michael
minnis
then
they
would
have
done
whatever
else
it
was
that
they
could
have
done.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
it's
a
little
bit
hypothetical
to
talk
about
what
we
might
have
done
had
they
directly
proposed
assessment
against
the
tribe.
this
case
arose
when
they
proposed
the
$2.6
million
assessment
against
the
tribal
chairman
who,
in
30
days,
he
would
have
been
personally
liable.
and
given
that
situation,
we
felt
that
they
had...
we
had
no...
we
had
no...
we
had
to
take
action
to
protect
this
individual
or
he
personally
would
have
been
liable
for
the
$2.6
million.
it
was
after
we
filed
suit
that
the
tax
commission
then
said
that
they
were
proposing
their
assessment
against
the
tribe.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
they're
contending,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that's
not
related
to
the
action
that
they
took.
they
did
not
take
action
to
try
and
get
us
to
collect
it.
they
never
came
to
us
and
said
you
ought
to
be
licensed.
they
never
came
to
us
and
said
start
collecting
this.
one
day
after
we'd
been
doing...
had
been
selling
on
the
tribe's
land
for
centuries...
not
centuries,
however
long
we've
been
there...
suddenly
we
get
a
$2.6
million
letter.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
michael
minnis
--i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
fair
to
say
the
tribe
knows
what
the
law
is.
well,
your
honor,
whether
they
do
or
not,
i
think
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
you're
bound
by
whether
you
know
about
it
or
not.
i
mean,
i'm
just
saying
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
true
that
they
knew
what
the
law
was.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
can't
speak
for
the
tribe
in
the
sense
that
i'm
not
their
business
committee,
but
i
would
suggest
that
they
have
acted
with...
i
think
that
they
have
acted
consistent
with
what
they
perceive
the
law
to
be,
even...
justice
white
asked
me
about
whether
or
not...
surely
they
knew
what
the
law
was.
but
we
have
taken
the
position
in
response
to
moe
v.
colville
analogy
that
oklahoma
and
this
particular
tribe
is
in
a
different
situation
than
the
tribes
were
in
colville
and
that
different
situation
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
specific
land
that
was
involved
here
is
land
that
the
united
states
government
promised
would
never
be
part
of
the
jurisdiction
of
any
state,
and
we
contend
that
that
promise
was
codified
in
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
well--
mr.
michael
minnis
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
then
i
would--
mr.
michael
minnis
--and
i'm
just
assuming
because
it's
a
hypothetical--
mr.
michael
minnis
--that
they
would
either
quit
selling
cigarettes
or
they
would
collect
the
tax.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
minnis
as
we
view
the
case,
the
case
is
simply
an
assessment
case.
we're
being
assessed
for
failure
to
collect
for
a
period
of
time
from
1981,
i
think,
to
1986.
but
they
reversed
the
district
court.
the
district
court
prospectively
indicated
that
the
tribe
should
collect
the
sales
tax.
mr.
michael
minnis
in
response
to
the
counterclaim
by
the
state.
mr.
michael
minnis
they
reversed
them
on
the
basis
that
the
tribe
had
sovereign
immunity
and
that
the
court,
the
district
court,
should
never
have
heard
the
case.
mr.
michael
minnis
the
relief
that
the
tenth
circuit
granted
was
simply
a
reverse
remanded
for
entry
of
order
as
prayed
for,
and
the
order
that
was
prayed
for
by
the
tribe
was
simply
an
injunction
against
the
proposed
assessment.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
don't
think
that
they
said
that
the
injunction
that
would
be
entered
after
remand
was
supposed
to
be
broad
enough
to
cover
that.
i
think
what
they
said
in
dicta
was
we
say
that
the
colville
case
is
not...
we
noticed
that
the
colville
case
took
place
in
a
public
law
280
state,
and
hence
the
arguments
being
made
by
the
state
are
not
valid.
but
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
opinion,
all
they
say
in
the
opinion
is
not
to
enter
an
injunction
consistent
with
what
we've
said,
but
rather
with
the
prayer.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
correct.
all
that
we're
suggesting
is
that
the
relief
we've
sought
is
all
we're
asking
for
is
to
enjoin
them
from
assessing
this
tax
against
the
tribe.
that's
the
only
relief
we
ask
for.
mr.
michael
minnis
in
this
case
assessing
the
tribe,
the
proposed
assessment
against
the
tribe.
we
didn't
ask
them
to
future...
to
tell
us
that
we
could
in
the
future
not
have
to
collect
it.
we
didn't
ask
that
we
be
given
a
declaratory--
mr.
michael
minnis
--yes,
your
honor,
we're
arguing
that
as
an
alternative
in
response
to
their
counterclaim,
that
their
counterclaim
was
not
valid
because
in
oklahoma
there's
a
situation
that's
different
from
montana,
washington,
and
california,
which
were
public
law
286.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
for
one
thing
i
think
that
there's
no
factual
foundation
for
that
in
the
sense
that
the
factual
dispute
that
caused
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
in
the
first
place.
they've
never
asked
us
to
collect
this.
they've
never
attempted
to
license
us
or
what
have
you.
the
only
thing
that
precipitated
this
lawsuit
and
the
only
fact
that's
in
the
case
in
this...
in
the
case
below
is
simply
the
proposed
tax
letter.
in
fact
there's
not
even
any
factual
dispute.
because
of
an
anomaly
there's
really
not
any
facts
in
the
record
concerning
the
counterclaim,
because
at
the
time
that
the
matter
was
submitted
to
the
court
on
briefs,
the
stipulations
all
went
to
the
tribe's
part
of
the
action,
because
the
parties
erroneously
thought
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
counterclaim
was
still
pending
and
it
wasn't.
it
had
already
been
ruled
on.
and
it
was
only
later
that
they
found
out
that
the
counterclaim...
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
counterclaim
had
been
overruled,
so
there's
no
factual
record
even
on
the
counterclaim
part
of
it.
but
that
brings
me
to
the
second
issue
which
i
think
is
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
tax
assessment
is
proper,
and
the
second
is
the
counterclaim.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
not
a
particularized
reason
now
for
doing
away
with
the
sovereign
immunity
and
certainly
not
in
this
case.
if,
as
we've
argued,
the
proposed
tax
assessment
is
unlawful,
then
what
this
court
would
be
condoning
would
be
condoning
the
state
taking
clearly
unlawful
action
and
using
it
as
a
way
to
bootstrap
themselves
to
litigate
issues
that
concern
them.
if
the
state
was
truly
concerned
about
litigating
the
issue
of
collection,
there
are
other
ways
that
they
could
have
brought
this
issue
to
court
besides
the
issue
of
direct
tax
assessment
for
which
they
have
yet
to
survive...
provide
this
court
with
any
authority
to
what
action
that
they
took.
if
they
wanted
the
moe
case
or
the
colville
case,
they
could
have
taken
actions
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
those
cases
that
they
could
take
since
it's
seizing
cigarettes
bound
for
the
tribal
reservation
or
what
have
you.
and
then
they
would
have
had
the
factual
foundation
to
raise
all
the
issues
they
would
have
raised
had
the
tribe
then
gone
in
and
sought
relief.
but
here
they
went
a
route
that
i
think
has
been
at
least
implicitly
indicated...
even
all
those
cases
is
not
the
proper
route
to
take,
which
is
to
assess
the
tribe
of
the
tax.
mr.
michael
minnis
in
favor
of
the
tribe.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
i...
no,
i'm
suggesting
that
if
they
wanted
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
seizing
the
cigarettes
that
that's
the
way
they
should
have
proceeded.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
we'd
still
defend
that
lawsuit.
we
wouldn't
be
defending
another
lawsuit.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
the
argument
we're
making
here
is
that
we're
being
asked
to
defend
the
lawsuit
that
they
didn't
bring
that
they
could
have
brought
and
the
one
that
they
have
brought
is
whether
or
not...
the
one
that
they
solely
define
by
the
actions
they
took
was
the
tax
assessment.
that's
the
way
they
brought
this
law...
i
mean,
that's
what
caused
this
lawsuit
to
be
brought,
not
some
of
these
other
things
that
perhaps
they
could
have
done.
mr.
michael
minnis
but
we
would
argue...
we
would
argue
this...
the
same
result.
in
this
case,
of
course,
they
did,
as
we
later
learned,
they
did
assess
the
wholesaler
for
the
same
taxes
that
they
are
attempting
to
collect
from
us.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
i
would
think...
well,
if
you...
it
is
insulting
if
you
contend
that
you
are
a
sovereign
and
that
you
are
immune
from
suit
and
you're
immune
from
tax.
the
idea
that
they
would
have
to
directly
renew,
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
they
said,
start
collecting
taxes--
mr.
michael
minnis
--yes,
your
honor,
but
you
still
end
up
with
who
pays
the
money
and
the
money
would
be
paid
by
the
tribe
under
a
direct
tax
assessment.
mr.
michael
minnis
your
honor,
that
would
presuppose
that
the
oklahoma
state
tax
laws
are
applicable
to
the
tribe,
and
if
they
are
applicable
to
the
tribe,
are
just
those
laws
or
are
all
state
laws?
mr.
michael
minnis
in
those
cases
the
court
was
clear
to
point
out
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
not
on
a
tribe
as
it
is
in
this
case
and
that
the
collection
of
the
tax
was
something
that
the
tribe...
those
cases
arose
when
the
tribe
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
and
what
this
court
did
was
say,
you're
not
entitled
to
the
injunctive
relief
because
you
should
have
been
collecting
the
tax
and
since
you
didn't
collect
the
tax
we're
not
going
to
give
you
the
injunctive
relief
you've
asked
for
to
stop
the
trucks
from
coming
into
your
reservation.
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
expressed
here
and
are
further
articulated
in
our
brief,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
