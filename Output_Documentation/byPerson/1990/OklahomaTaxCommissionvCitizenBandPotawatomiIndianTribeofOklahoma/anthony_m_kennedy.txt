could
you
require
the
wholesaler
to
affix
the
stamps
on
100
percent
of
the
cigarettes
and
then
just
rebate
the
tribe
for
those
that
were
sold
to
indians?
justice
kennedy
they're
not
doing
business
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
by
the
end
sale?
justice
kennedy
we
can
pursue
it
some
other
time.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
would
have
authority
to
seize
and
not
authority
to
require
that
the
tax
stamp
be
affixed.
justice
kennedy
mr.
kneedler,
why
is
there
difficulty
in
suing
the
tribal
store
manager
in
an
oklahoma
state
court?
just
because
they
can't
physically
get
the
jurisdiction?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
an
assessment
against
the
tribe,
that
the
state's
taking
a
position
that
they're
taxing
a
transaction
and
the
transaction
is
taxable.
justice
kennedy
but
your
contention
is
that
neither
this
court
nor
the
courts
that
have
heard
the
case
previously
has
the
authority
to
make
that
decision
in
this
case
because
it's
not
an
issue
of
this
property
before
us?
justice
kennedy
well,
when
you
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
ask
for
its
equitable
powers
to
be
exercised
on
your
behalf
in
a
situation
as
complex
as
this,
why
isn't
appropriate
for
the
court
to
make
an
announcement
that
perhaps
the
tribe
cannot
be
assessed
directly
but
that
the
tribe
has
the
duty
and
the
responsibility
to
remit
the
taxes
to
the
state?
