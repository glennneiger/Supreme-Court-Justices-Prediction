mr.
david
allen
miley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
convenience
store
operated
by
the
tribe
on
land
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
government
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
the
tribe
sells
untaxed
cigarettes
and
other
convenience
store
items
from
its
store
to
the
general
public
at
large
without
collecting
the
state
taxes.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
whether
the
state
taxes
are
applicable
to
this
tribal
business
and
whether
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
prevents
the
state
from
collecting
its
taxes.
oklahoma
law
requires
the
vendor
to
collect
these
taxes.
these
taxes
are
validly
imposed
upon
the
citizens
of
this
state.
the
vendor
in
this
case
is
the
tribe.
under
the
cases
of
moe
and
colville...
moe
is
a
1976
case
and
colville
from
1980...
this
court
required
tribal
sellers
on
a
reservation
in
those
cases
to
collect
the
state
taxes
against...
on
sales
to
nontribal
members.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes,
we
do.
mr.
david
allen
miley
and
what
authority
do
you
cite
for
that
proposition?
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
i
think
this
case
is
on
point
with
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
v.
jones
decision
of
1973,
and
there
we
had
an
off-reservation
business
operated
by
the
tribe
that
was
found
to
be
reliable
for
$26,000
in
gross
receipts
taxes
on
its
sales
and
that
it...
and
that
that
tribe--
--well,
if
we
think
that
this
is
on
what
amounts
to
indian
land,
do
you
take
that
position?
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
i
think
the
mcclanahan
case
and
the
colville
case
find
that
the
tribal
members
in
those
cases
were
not
taxable
because
they...
the
sales
occurred
on
the
reservation
or,
in
the
mcclanahan
case,
the
individual
earned
her
income
on
the
reservation.
and
because
the
state
taxation
would
infringe
upon
the
tribe's
right
to
govern
itself
within
that
reservation,
those
taxes
were
not
allowed.
here
we
don't
have
a
reservation
situation,
as
this
court
has
found
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
united
states.
the
situation
in
oklahoma
is
much
different.
there
are
no
reservations
as
such
as
are
found
in
other
states.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
in
1891
there
was
a
sum
certain
session
agreement
that
this
court
held
in
the
decoteau
case...
found
that
those...
that...
this
specific
session
agreement
which
was
mentioned
in
the
case
did
disestablish
the
reservations
that
were
involved
in
that
agreement.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that
is
correct.
the
land...
the
particular
land
in
this
case
was
conveyed
back
to
the...
from
the
united
states
in
1961
and
1964
to
the
tribe
in
unrestricted
status,
in
nontrust
status,
because
the
federal
government
did
not
want
to
maintain
any
supervision
over
the
land
because
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
and
expense
for
the
federal
government.
so
they
did
not
want
to
maintain
the
land
in
any
way.
in
1976,
though,
the
tribe
did
want
to
build
some
public
buildings
and
a
community
center,
and
they
wanted
to
apply
for
loans.
the
federal...
the
economic
development
administration
for
their
protection
wanted
this
land
to
be
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
rather
than
in
the
tribe's
own
name.
so
in
1975
that
land
was
transferred
in
trust
under
section
501,
but
that
section...
title
25,
section
501
of
the
united
states
code.
but
that
section
doesn't
set
up
any
reservation
status
for
the
land,
and
it
is
my
position
that
the...
in
order
to
create
a
reservation,
the
congress
or
the
president
of
the
united
states
must
act
to
do
that,
and
i
don't
think
that's
been
done
in
this
case.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
i
think
the...
there
are
cases
that
hold
that
trust
land
in
the...
for
instance
in
the
john
decision,
the
trust
land
is
a...
has
reservation
status,
but
i
believe
in
those
cases
there
was
a
resident
tribal
population
in
those
cases
where
the
government
was
supervising
that
land.
mr.
david
allen
miley
not...
these
are
lands
that
are
for
the
tribal
headquarters
and
a
golf
course
and
public
buildings
here.
but
at
any
rate,
even
on
a
reservation
the
tax
laws
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
would
apply
to
the
transactions.
and
i
think
as
we
have
seen
in
the
population
statistics
that
were
located
in
our
brief,
we
can
see
the
assimilation
of
this
tribe
into
the
general
community,
and
it's
safe
to
say
that
most
of
the
sales
from
this
tribal
store
are
not
to
tribal
members.
but
i
think
the
cases
of
moe
and
colville
clearly
stand
for
the
state's
rights.
and
i
think
the
mescalero
point...
the
mescalero
case
goes
on
to
say
that
tribal
businesses
that
are
located
off
the
reservation
are
subject
to
the
same
state
laws
as
all
other
businesses.
and
i
think
in
that
mescalero
case,
in
note
11,
the
solicitor
argued
in
that
case
that
that
land
was
virtually
held
in
trust
for
the
tribe
in
that
situation,
although
it
was
a
lease
from
the
department
of
interior
i
believe.
however,
it
would
have
been
useless
to
transfer
the
land
in
that
situation,
so
that
was
in
effect
trust
land
in
that
case.
so
i
believe
this
case
is
on
point
when
you
look
at
the
cases
of
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
united
states
along
with
the
mescalero
case.
i
believe
that
the
federal
intent
in
oklahoma
was
not
to
create
this
kind
of
situation,
and
clearly
congress
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
reservation
situation
when
they
were
passing
the
indian
reorganization
act.
they
wanted
to
exclude
oklahoma
from
that
and
pass
a
separate
act
for
oklahoma
because
oklahoma
has
gone
past
the
reservation
system,
and
i
think
that
was...
yes?
mr.
david
allen
miley
well--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct
and--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct.
but
i
believe
in
this
case
when...
the
mcclanahan
case,
specifically
states,
and
also
in
williams
v.
lee
in
a
footnote,
that
when
they
were
talking
about
the
arizona
situation,
the
navaho
reservation
and
that
situation,
they
say
these
notions
of
indian
sovereignty
are
not
applicable
in
cases
such
as
where
indians
have
left
or
never
inhabited
reservations,
such
as
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
united
states.
so--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
yes.
well,
in
the
situation
of
these
indians
in
this
state,
in
oklahoma,
there
is
not
that
reservation
status
as
that
status
is
recognized
in
other
states.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
it
would
apply
to
a
certain
extent,
but
it's
not...
the
land
was
transferred
in
trust
in
1975
in
order
for
the
tribe
to
qualify
for
loans.
before
that
time
the
federal
government
has
no
interest
in
ever
supervising
this
piece
of
land.
so
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
this
case.
but
you
are
correct
in
other
situations
this
court
has
held
differently.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
these
facts,
and
i
don't
think
congress
really
intended
for
reservation
status
to
be
developed
again
in
oklahoma
because
of
the
failure
of
that
system
in...
previously.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i
don't
believe
the
solicitor
general
does.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no.
at
any
rate
our
position
is
that
whether
it
is
a
reservation
or
not,
and
even
if
it
is
held
to
be
a
reservation,
the
sales
are
still
taxable.
however,
what
we
are
experiencing
in
this
case
is
that
although
this
court
has
found
that
in
1976
in
moe,
in
1980
in
colville,
in
1985
in
the
chemehuevi
decision
out
of
california
that
tribal
stores
just
like
this
one
should
collect
the
state's
taxes--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--on
sales
to
nonmembers
which--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
yes,
i
do.
mr.
david
allen
miley
but
if
they
collected
sales
against
nonmembers
in
this
situation,
they
would
be
collecting
taxes
on
99
percent
of
their
sales.
so--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--collecting
the
tax.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
the
tenth
circuit--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
in
this
case
we
have
issued
an
assessment--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
that
is
the
problem
we
are
faced.
we
cannot
collect
it
unless
the
tribe
cooperates.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
we
have--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
under
oklahoma
law
the
owner
of
the
store
is
responsible
rather
than
employees.
we
could
not
hold
an
employee
liable
even
though
it
might
be
their
duty.
we
have
to
go
against
the
owner,
and
the
owner
in
this
case--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
we
have
had
in
another
case
in
the
chickasaw
nation
case
that
was
up
here
a
few
years
ago,
we
did
try
to
sue
the
manager
of
the
store
but
the
tenth
circuit
opinion,
which
was
vacated
in
that
case,
is
now
before
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
but
the
tenth
circuit
had
held
in
that
case
that
we
could
not
get
around
tribal
sovereign
immunity
by
assessing
tribal
employees
for
the
tax.
mr.
david
allen
miley
correct.
mr.
david
allen
miley
correct.
that's
correct.
i
was
just
merely
stating
that
we've
been
unsuccessful
thus
far
in
that
tact.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
that's
what...
we
do
require
the
wholesaler
to
do
that,
however,
when
the
tribes
in
oklahoma
purchased
their
cigarettes
from
as
far
away
as
tennessee
or
nebraska
from
wholesalers
who
have
no
nexus
with
the
state
of
oklahoma,
they
will
then
ship
those
in
on
common
carrier
or
otherwise,
basically
bootleg
them
into
the
state
and--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--no,
no.
if
they
don't
have
a
presence
within
the
state...
if
they
merely
ship
on
common
carrier
to
a
certain
location,
they
have...
there's
no
sufficient
nexus
if
they
don't
have
any
trucks
or
warehouse
or
anything
in
oklahoma,
we
can't
make
those
other
wholesalers
pay
the
tax.
so,
at
that
point,
although
it
is
perfectly
fine
for
someone
to
buy
cigarettes
from
an
out-of-state
wholesaler...
that's
not
disallowed,
but
at
that
point
the
retailer
is
then
obligated
to
purchase
the
stamps
because
the
retailer
is
located
in
oklahoma.
we
do
have
jurisdiction
over
the
retailer.
and
in
that
case
the
retailer
would
be
responsible.
if
those
taxes
were
not
properly
paid,
then
the
retailer
would
be
responsible
for
the
delinquent
liabilities.
and
that
puts
us
back
facing
the
tribe
again,
and
the
only
other
way
to
enforce
that
would
be
seizures
of
the
shiploads
of
cigarettes
coming
in.
and
that
is--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
we
do
not
have
the
authority
for...
to
require
a
wholesaler
in
another
state
to
comply
with
our
laws.
if
they
are
not
themselves
coming
into
this
state
to
make
the
deliveries
or
if
we
do
not
have
any
evidence
that
they
are
coming
into
this
state
to
make
those
deliveries.
and
so
we
kind
of
have
to
catch
them
in
the
act
and
then
we
would
have
to
hold
their
property,
like
a
truck,
in
order
to
enforce
that.
so
we
have
trouble
enforcing
the
laws
across
state
lines.
that's
why
we
look
to
the
people
that
are
located
in
oklahoma
to
enforce
this
law
against.
and
so
that
brings
us
to
the
examination
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity
and
of
course,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
united
states
fidelity
and
guaranty
case
in
1932
and
again
in
the
puyallup
case
in
1977,
this
tribe
is
immune
from
suit.
however,
it
is
my
position
that
circumstances
have
changed
such
that
this
doctrine
should
be
reexamined.
back
in
1932
that
case
involved
a
lawsuit
by
the
united
states
to
protect
tribal
coal
royalties
that
were
owed
to
the
tribe
and
the
tribe
was
held
to
be
immune
from
a
counterclaim
in
that
suit
because
the
united
states
government
was
trying
to
protect
the
fragile
existence
of
the
tribal
ward,
and
it
was
necessary
in
that
circumstance.
i
think,
however,
the
scope
of
the
tribal
entity
has
increased
greatly
from
those
days
and
they
are
not
reaching
into
the
community
of
the
state
where
state
laws
do
apply.
i
think
this
is
quite
a
drastic
change
and
requires
us
to
look
again
at
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
now
i'm
not
saying
that
sovereign
immunity
of
an
indian
tribe
should
be
abandoned
for
all
purposes
or
that
it
would
be...
should
be
absolutely
abrogated
in
any
way.
i'm
just
trying
to
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
interest
in
collecting
the
taxes
from
the
state
citizens
who
are
properly
taxable.
the
sovereign
immunity,
i
believe,
is
a
limited
sovereign
immunity
for
an
indian
tribe
which
should
be
limited
to,
properly,
the
tribal
courts
and
the
internal
and
social
relations
of
the
tribe
certainly,
and
in
the
tribe's
commercial
area,
where
they
are
dealing
with
people
who
stand
on
maybe
a
different
footing
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
i
can
see
where
they
could
assert
sovereign
immunity
in
that
case.
but
here
we
don't...
we
aren't
dealing
with
a
consensual
relationship
as
such
and
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
where
we
are
trying
to
get
the
tribe
to
cooperate
with
the
tax
laws
of
oklahoma,
which
we
feel,
under
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
that
we
have
a
right
to
have
them
administrate
on
our
behalf.
i
think
this
court
has
found
that
that
administration
is
such
a
burden
on
the
tribe
that
it
would
infringe
tribal
self-government,
and
we
certainly
recognize
the
government
of
the
tribe.
but
i
believe
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
this
tribe
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
displace
these
valid
state
laws.
and
i
believe
that
that's
what
the
tribe,
as
differentiated
from
how
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
has
been
used
in
the
past,
this
tribe
is
using
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
to
evade
valid
law
enforcement.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
allen
miley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
by
staying
that
first
of
all
the
state
has
the
authority
under
state
law
to
require
this
taxation.
the
tax
assessment
was
made
to
enforce
this
tax
collection.
we...
under
the
moe
and
colville
decision,
we
believe
we
have
the
right
to
these
taxes.
we
found
no
other
way
to
enforce
these
taxes
than
by
tax
assessment
in
this
case.
it
is
my
position
that
you
cannot
properly
separate
the
collection
of
a
tax
from
the
enforcement
of
the
tax,
because
as
we
have
seen
in
this
case
the
tribe
will
not
collect
if
the
only
consequences
of
that
is
getting
away
with
it.
so
they
have
operated
for
many
years
without
collecting
with
our...
likewise
with
the
state's
inability
to
ever
enforce
those
laws.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no,
we
have
not
requested
congress
to
do
that.
i
think
congress
is
not
in
a
position
to
do
that,
and
i
think--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
i
believe
congress
could
do
that
if
it
wanted
to.
it
just
doesn't
want
to.
they
are
not
properly
the
tax
collection
agents
for
the
state
of
oklahoma.
they
are
not
concerned
with
collecting
oklahoma
taxes,
so
the
congressmen
don't--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--that's
correct,
and
they
would
be
concerned
and
they
have
passed
several
laws
like
the
bingo
laws
to
encoarage
economic
development,
but
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
an
area
where
we
do
not
need
to
go
to
congress
to
ask
congress
if
the
state
of
oklahoma
can
collect
its
taxes.
i
believe
we
have--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--we
could
take
that
position,
although
congress...
that
would
be
a
political
decision
that
i
don't
think
many
congressmen
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
faced
with
constituents
who
maybe
feel
differently
about
the
issue
than
the
state
does.
thank
you.
that
is
all
i
have.
