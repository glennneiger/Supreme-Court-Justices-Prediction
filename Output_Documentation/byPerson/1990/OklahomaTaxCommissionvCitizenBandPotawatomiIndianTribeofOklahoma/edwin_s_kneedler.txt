mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
that
the
court
may
dispose
of
the
case
by
application
of
three
settled
principles.
first
that
federal
law
affords
indian
tribes
immunity
from
all
suits
except
where
congress
has
expressly
consented
to
such
suits
or
the
tribe
waives
its
immunity.
second,
that
states
may
not
tax
sales
of
goods
on
an
indian
reservation
to
members
of
a
tribe.
and
third,
that
states
may
tax
non-indians
who
purchase
goods
from
an
indian
tribe
or
member
of
a
tribe
on
an
indian
reservation.
the
first
of
these
points
arises
in
connection
with
the
tax
commission's
counterclaim
against
the
tribe
in
this
case.
the
tribe
concedes
that
that
counterclaim
is
barred
under
existing
law,
under
the
existing
rule
of
federal
sovereign
immunity.
but
it
urges
the
court
to
modify
that
rule
or
to
abandon
that
rule
in
the
context
of
this
case.
but
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
that
it
is
up
to
congress
to
modify...
excuse
me...
tribal
sovereign
immunity
where
congress
believes
that
that
is
wise.
and
it
is
congress
that
could
best
take
into
account
the
various
competing
considerations:
the
infringements
on
tribal
sovereign
that
might
be
implicated,
the
economic
consequences
for
a
tribe
in
exposing
it
to
not
only
the
cost
of
litigation
but
adverse
judgments.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are
several
possible
remedies.
now,
the
court
made
clear
in
santa
clara
pueblo
v.
martinez
that
tribal
sovereign
immunity
extends
only
to
the
tribe.
it
does
not
protect...
under
a
rational
analogous
to
ex
parte
young,
does
not
protect
tribal
officers
from
suit.
so
in
this
case
the
manager
of
the
tribal
store
or
other
persons
responsible
for
operating
it
would
not
be
protected
by
sovereign
immunity.
now
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
what
forum
such
a
suit
could
be
brought
in.
but
as
the...
as
we
read
the
tribal
code,
the
tribal
court,
for
example,
would
be
available.
but
in
any
event
the
tax
commission
has
not
tried
that.
also,
although
the
tax
commission
argues
here
that
it
has
no
ability
to
enforce
its
law
against
wholesalers
shipped
from
out
of
state
even
though
it
concedes
it's
coming
from
instate,
that
just
happens
to
be
the
arrangement
of
oklahoma
law
at
the
present
time.
it's
possible
that
oklahoma
may
be
able
to
amend
its
law
to
impose
a
duty
on
wholesalers
who
ship
from
out
of
state
or
consign
shipments
to
shippers
who
bring
them
into
state
to
impose
the
tax
stamps
on
the
cigarettes
in
the
same
manner
that
it
currently
requires
of
wholesalers
who
have
a
place
of
business
in
the
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
should
not.
in
our
view
the
proper
course
for
the
court
to
follow
would
be
to
affirm
the
tribe's
own
immunity
from
suit
and
to
vacate
that...
and
therefore
affirm
the
dismissal
of
the
counterclaim.
but
with
respect
to
the
tribe's
suit
for
affirmative
injunctive
relief,
we
think
that
all
the
court
really
needs
to
do
here
is
to
vacate
the
injunction
that
the
court
of
appeals
ordered,
premised
on
the
view
that
it's
a
substantive
matter.
the
tribe
did
not
have
to
collect
the
tax
on
the
sales
to
non-indians
or
indians.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief
the
court
sought
to
distinguish
this
court's
holdings
in
moe,
colville,
and
chemehuevi
that
the
state
may
collect
taxes
on
the
sales
to
the
non-indians
on
the
ground
that
oklahoma
has
not
accepted
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
however,
bryan
v.
itasca
county
held
that
public
law
280
does
not
confer
taxing
jurisdiction
on
states
that
accept
jurisdiction
under
that
law.
we
think
it
follows
that
oklahoma's
refusal
to
accept
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280
does
not
withhold
taxing
jurisdiction
from
the
state.
in
other
words,
public
law
280
is
simply
put
to
one
side
on
the
question
of
the
state's
authority
to
tax.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
for
that
reason
we
think
the
court
should
vacate
the
injunction
that
the
court
of
appeals...
or
vacate
the
judgment
below
to
the
extent
the
court
ordered
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
in
both
chemehuevi
and
in
colville
there
was
a
sovereign
immunity
claim
against
counter
claims
by
tribes
in
essentially
identical
situations
as
this.
and
in
chemehuevi,
although
the
court
granted
review
and
summarily
reversed
on
the
substantive
tax
question,
it
left
standing
the
lower
court's
ruling
on
the
sovereign
immunity
question.
this
is
an
arrangement
that
has
been
in
existence
for
sometime,
that
the
state
has
the
substantive
right
to
tax
but
cannot
sue
the
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
result
might
be
different,
but
we
think
that
would
not
be
within
the
court's
authority
and
even
prior
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
the
court
did
not
take
it
upon
itself
to
modify
that
rule.
at
that
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
not
until
the
tate
letter
of
1953.
in
other
words,
it
was...
whichever
political
branch
was
responsible
in
the
area
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
the
executive
branch,
prior
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
made
sovereign
immunity
determinations
with
respect
to
foreign
countries.
the
court
did
not,
in
other
words,
take
it
upon
itself.
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
travel
sovereign
immunity
like
all
others,
this
court
has
said
that
the
occasions
for
when
a
tribe
should
be
brought
out
from
under
the
usual
federal
rules
that
that's
the
responsibility
of
the
political
branches,
because
there
is
a
political
judgment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
not
an
act
of
congress,
but
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
fair
to
say
that
the
court
created.
i
think
the
court
recognized
it,
looking
to
the
status
of
indian
tribes
within
the
constitutional
scheme.
the
constitution
refers
to
indian
nations
under
the
commerce
clause
and
gives
to
congress
the
authority
to
regulate
commerce
with
the
indians.
that's
exactly...
with
the
indian
nations,
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
here:
commerce
with
an
indian
nation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
derives
from
the
status
of
indian
nations
as
sovereign
entities
that
predate
the
constitution
in
fact
and
that
are
recognized
in
the
constitution.
just
like
the
federal
rule
barring
sale
of
indian
lands
without
the
consent
of
the
federal
government,
it
stems
from--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
it
predated
the
constitution
and,
you
know,
neither
the
court
recognized
it
as
a
common
law
rule
in
additional
to
a
statutory
rule.
but
in
any
event
as
to
both
rules,
the
court
said
that
until
congress
consents,
the
established
rule,
in
that
case
against
alienation
of
land
and
in
this
case
against
sovereign
immunity,
prevails
until
congress
creates
an
exception.
and
congress
has
in
fact
acted
on
that
assumption
in
numerous
occasions,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
necessary.
i
mean,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
depends--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they
shouldn't
have
gotten--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they
shouldn't
have
gotten
as
broad
an
injunction
as
they
did.
the
injunction
the
court
of
appeals
held
applied
even
to
sales
to
nonmembers.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
first
of
all
if
the
tribe,
recognizing
that
this
court
will
have
held
that
it
must
collect
taxes
on
sales
to
nonmembers,
we
think
that
the
tribe
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so
and
that
we
should
not
assume
that
once
the
tribe
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
disabused
of
the
notion
that
moe
and
colville
don't
apply,
perhaps
the
tribe
will
voluntarily
proceed.
but
then
there's
the
other
possibility
of
a
suit
and
also
the
possibility
of
seizing
cigarettes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
what
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
more
completely
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
address
that
if
necessary.
we
think
that
this
is
something
best
left
to
the
tribe
and
the
state
to
work
out
on
remand.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
because
oklahoma
has
not
accepted
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280,
civil
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
at
least
with
respect
to
an
indian
on...
in
indian
country
in
oklahoma
would
not
reside
in
the
state
courts.
but
that
simply
follows
from
oklahoma's
decision
not
to
assume
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280.
with
respect
to
the
reservation
status
of
this
land,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
follows
not
only
from
john
and
mcgowan,
where
the
court
said
that
a
formal
designation
of
reservation
status
is
not
necessary.
but
also
decisions
of
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuits,
other
circuits
with
indian...
considerable
indian
country
which
have
also
held
that
tribal
trust
land
such
as
this
enjoys
reservation
status.
and
most
recently
congress
has
affirmed
that
principle
in
the
indian
gaming
statute
which
basically
codifies
the
preemption
principles
this
court
applied
in
cabazon
and
specifically
held
that
those
preemption
principles
apply
to
tribal
trust
land,
not
just
formal...
formally
designated
reservation
and
specifically
with
respect
to
oklahoma.
and
in
fact
this
tribe
has
a
bingo
parlor
on
this
very
parcel
of
land
and
is
protected
by
similar
immunities.
thank
you.
