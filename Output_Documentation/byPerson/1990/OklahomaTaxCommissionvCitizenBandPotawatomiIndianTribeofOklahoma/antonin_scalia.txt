i'm
not
sure
what
your...
are
you
arguing
there
has
to
be
a
declaration
of
reservation
status
before
the
indian
tribe
would
have
sovereign
powers
in
the
area?
justice
scalia
because
i
don't
think
our
cases
support
that.
i
think
we've
clearly
said
to
the
contrary.
i
think
we
said
in
johns
that
the
test
is
simply
whether
the
land
has
been
validly
set
apart
for
the
use
of
the
indians
as
such
under
the
superintendence
of
the
government.
justice
scalia
and
we've
held
in
other
cases,
haven't
we,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
formal
declaration
of
reservation
status.
justice
scalia
not
applicable
when
indians
have
left?
you
mean
when
the
tribe
is
not
in
residence?
is
that
the
key
that
you
say
makes
the
difference
here?
justice
scalia
why?
if
the
test
is
whether
the
land
has
been
validly
set
apart
for
the
use
of
the
indians
as
such
under
superintendence
of
the
government,
that
test
would
certainly
apply
here.
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
even
before
the
passage
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
my
recollection
is
that
at
least
some
courts
had
adopted
what
most...
what
has
been
adopted
internationally
in
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
in
the
case
where
the
supposed
sovereign
is
not
acting
in
a
governmental
capacity
but
in
a
commercial
capacity.
now
if
one
applied
the
commercial
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
here,
would
the
result
be
different?
justice
scalia
with
respect
to
foreign
countries,
hadn't
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
done
so
in--
