well,
in
your
example
about
your
property,
why
would
the
debtor...
if
it's
going
to
be
sold
in
one
proceeding
or
another,
why
would
it,
why
would
he
want
to
sell
it
in
chapter
11
rather
than
chapter
7?
justice
white
just
to
help
the
creditor?
justice
white
i
thought
maybe
his
desire
would
be
to
retain
the
property
for
himself
and
maybe,
maybe
he's
got...
he
obviously
doesn't
have
a
steady
income
or
he'd
be
in
13,
i
suppose.
justice
white
but
it
may
be
he
has
potential
to
earn
money--
justice
white
--and
pay
off
his
creditors
in
full.
justice
white
but
he
can
get
in
chapter
11.
justice
white
you
think.
justice
white
what
does
he
have
to
show
to
get
a
plan
approved
under
chapter
11?
justice
white
and
he
can
scale
down
the
unsecured,
i
suppose,
if
he
can--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
sure.
justice
white
before
the
credit
down
operates.
justice
white
and
he
can't
scale
down
secured
creditors?
he
can
postpone
them?
justice
white
would
that
be
provided
they
don't
have
regular
income?
justice
white
but
that's
only
if
some
feasible
plan
to
pay
off
these
debts
over
a
period
of
time.
justice
white
but
the
creditors
would
get
more
than
they
would
get
in
chapter
7?
justice
white
but
they
wouldn't
lose
anything?
justice
white
except
the
time
when
they
would
get
it.
