mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
not
at
all
unnatural
to
reorganize
consumer
debts
in
chapter
11.
if
an
individual
proprietor
who
owns
a
mom
and
pop
store
has
debts,
he
can,
he
or
she
can
file
under--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--it's
actually
defined
in
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
under
1017.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
it's
defined
to
mean
debts
contracted
primarily
for
a
personal,
family,
or
household
obligation.
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--a
mom
and
pop
store
could
have
business
debts
and
consumer
debts.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
the
code
does
provide
a
distinction.
i
think
raising
that
point
has
two
very
important
indications.
first,
since
the
code
does
define
consumer
debts,
if
congress
wanted
to
exclude
individuals
with
purely
consumer
debtors
from
chapter
11
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
add
a
phrase
to
section
109(d).
along
with
stockbrokers
and
commodity
brokers
who
are
excluded
from
chapter
11,
congress
simply
could
have
added
the
phrase
individuals
with
only
consumer
debts,
and
that
would
have
had
the
same
effect
as
the
eighth
circuit's
judgment
in
this
case.
the
second
point,
and
based
on
the
definition
of
consumer
debtor
in
the
code,
is
that
it
is
very
wise
for
congress
not
to
include
such
a
bar.
it's
a
very
difficult
threshold
inquiry
for
a
bankruptcy
court
to
decide
the
primary
reason
why
debts
were
contracted.
so
if
you
adopted
an
ongoing
business
requirement
or
a
consumer
debt
limitation
as
part
of
a
chapter
11
threshold
inquiry,
the
bankruptcy
court
would
have
to
figure
out
why
primarily
debts
were
contracted.
looking
at
petitioner's
debts
in
this
case
indicates
how
difficult
that
can
be.
the
entire
schedule
of
debts
is
basically
credit
card
debts,
utility
debts,
many
of
which
were
contracted
for
a
business
purpose
as
part
of
this
petitioner's
consulting
business
or
as
part
of
his
business
to
get...
to
solicit
charitable
contributions,
both
of
which
were
businesses.
so
it's
very,
it's
a
very
inappropriate
and
difficult
inquiry
to
have
at
the
start
of
a
bankruptcy
litigation.
if
a
mom
and
pop
store
does
file
under
chapter
11,
the
store
can
adjust
and
reorganize
both
the
business
debts
and
the
consumer
debts
as
defined
in
the
code.
in
fact
in
1990
according
to
statistics
from
the
administrative
office
of
u.s.
courts,
more
than
2,500,
or
12
percent
of
chapter
11
cases
were
filed
by
individuals
primarily
with
consumer
debts.
so
it's
not
at
all
unnatural
for
bankruptcy
courts
to
reorganize
cases
when
the
primary
debts
to
reorganize
are
consumer
debts.
given
that
that's
the
case,
there's
no
reason
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
in
bankruptcy
policy
to
prevent
mom
and
pop
from
going
in
and
reorganizing
just
their
consumer
debts,
and
not
bring
in
the
store
as
well.
three
points
very
briefly
this
afternoon.
first,
reorganization
serves
a
useful
purpose.
second,
it
won't
be
subject
to
abuse.
and
third,
it's
dictated
by
the
code
regardless
of
whether
we
think
it's
a
good
idea.
chapter
11
serves
a
useful
purpose
for
reorganizing
consumer
debts
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
some
assets
are
worth
more
in
chapter
11
than
they
are
in
chapter
11.
and
that's
because
some
assets
have
no
ready
market
because
there
is
no
pool
of
competing
buyers.
a
possible
example
here
is
petitioner's
stock.
the
corporation's
only
assets
are
licensed
to...
licenses
to
build
low-head
hydroelectric
power
plants
on
some
rivers.
the
only
offers
we
have
are
from
corporate
insiders,
and
the
number
of
licenses
and
the
amount
of
money
at
stake
probably
is
not
sufficient
to
get
disinterested
buyers
or
at
least
the
large
number
of
disinterested
buyers
assumed
by
the
efficient
market
hypothesis,
to
bid
on
these
assets
and
get
a
fair
return
in
a
liquidation
sale.
in
these
kinds
of
situations
it
may
well
be
better
to
reorganize
rather
than
liquidate.
the
second
and
more
typical
example
of
when
it
makes
sense
to
reorganize
under
chapter
7
rather
than...
reorganize
under
chapter
11,
excuse
me,
rather
than
liquidate,
is
when
there's
an
asset
that
the
debtor
for
whatever
reason
wants
to
have,
be
it
a
family
homestead
or,
in
this
case,
stock
that
the
petitioner
really
deeply
concerns
about.
as
petitioner
pointed
out,
there
is
no
requirement
and
it's
not
possible
under
chapter
11
to
force
the
debtor
to
give
up
his
future
wage
income.
under
chapter
11,
however,
the
petitioner
or
debtor
can,
if
he
or
she
wants,
pledge
future
wage
income
in
order
to
redeem
an
asset
that
would
otherwise
be
liquidated
under
chapter
7.
in
that
case
the
debtor
can
give
a
better
deal
to
the
creditors
in
return
for
getting
them
to
return
an
otherwise
non-exempt
asset,
in
this
case
petitioner's
stock.
that
sort
of
deal
may
propose
benefits
for
the
creditors
and
the
debtors.
second,
individuals
with
purely
consumer
debts
will
not
be
able
to
abuse
chapter
11.
petitioner
has
already
described
the
authority
under
section
1112(b)
which
allows
a
court
to
dismiss
a
chapter
11
case
for
cause.
and
the
statute
describes
10
non-exclusive
factors
for
what
may
constitute
cause,
and
the
cases
that
amicus
cites
on
page
10
of
his
brief
indicate
that
courts
use
this
policing
power
with
fair
degree
of
regularity.
the
only
point
i
would
like
to
add
here
is
the
role
of
the
united
states
trustee,
which
is
my
client
in
this
case.
the
u.s.
trustee,
under
28
u.s.c.
586
has
a
role
in
supervising
every
chapter
11
case.
under
section
1112(b)
the
u.s.
trustee
is
specifically
authorized
to
come
in
and
file
a
motion
so
that
if
this,
if
there
is
an
abusive
chapter
11
filing,
if
there
is
no
possibility
of
effectuating
plan,
if
there
is
no
money
or
income
to
fund
a
plan,
the
u.s.
trustee's
duty
and
obligation
is
to
come
in
and
file
the
motion
and
take
care
of
the
case.
and
that
is
in
fact
what
the
u.s.
trustee
does
right
now
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
where
the
rule
under
the
moog
case
is
that
consumers
can
file
chapter
11
petitions.
my
final
point
is
that
the
bankruptcy
code
makes
consumer
debtors
eligible
for
relief
under
chapter
11.
the
plain
language
of
the
code
has
been
described,
and
in
response
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
i
have
already
described
how
unadministerable
it
would
be
to
have
any
other
limit.
with
that,
i
have
nothing
further.
