mr.
peter
m.
lieb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
individual
who
has
no
business
is
eligible
for
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
amicus
in
this
case
has
urged
this
court
to
adopt
a
business
requirement
for
chapter
11,
even
though
such
a
requirement
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
would
add
a
complexity
to
bankruptcy
cases
that
was
not
intended
by
congress.
section
109(d)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
by
its
terms
provides
that
a
person,
except
for
a
stockbroker
or
a
commodities
broker,
who
is
eligible
for
chapter
7
is
also
eligible
for
chapter
11.
section
101.37
of
the
code
defines
the
word
"person"
to
include
an
individual,
partnership,
or
corporation.
the
plain
meaning
of
these
words
is
that,
except
for
a
stockbroker
or
commodities
broker,
an
individual,
partnership,
or
corporation
who
is
eligible
for
chapter
7
is
also
eligible
for
chapter
11.
and
since
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
an
individual
without
a
business
is
eligible
for
a
chapter
7,
the
statute
by
its
terms
makes
them
eligible
for
chapter
11
as
well.
now,
the
use
of
the
word
109(d)
cannot
be
viewed
as
a
legislative
oversight
or
a
carelessly
chosen
word.
in
section
109
congress
focused
exclusively
on
eligibility
for
the
various
chapters,
and
congress
demonstrated
in
section
109
that
it
knew
how
to
limit
eligibility
for
the
various
chapters,
and
that
it
even
knew
how
to
distinguish
some
persons
from
other
persons.
section
109(e),
for
example,
limits
the
eligibility
in
chapter
13
to
some
individuals.
congress
also
demonstrated
in
section
1304
that
it
knew
how
to
distinguish
individuals
who
were
engaged
in
a
business
from
individuals
who
were
not
engaged
in
a
business.
and
so
we
believe
that
the
amicus'
concession
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
express
business
requirement
in
the
code
for
chapter
11
is
a
clear
indication
that
no
such
requirement
was
intended
by
congress.
the
amicus--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--it
does
mean
that,
although
we
think
it's
unlikely
that
that
will
happen
very
often.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
because...
because...
for
the
same
reasons
that
we
think
that
consumers
will
not
generally...
well,
it
doesn't
generally
make
sense
for
a
consumer
to
use
chapter
11
because
of
the
complexity
and
the
length
of
a
chapter
11
proceeding.
and
for
the
same
reasons
creditors
will
not
want
to
put
consumer
debtors
into
chapter
11
because
of
the
added
complexity
and
the
length
of
the
proceedings.
it
may
make
sense
in
most
cases
to
force
them
into
chapter
7.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
congress
did
reject
that
in
chapter
13,
but
there
were
peculiar
reasons
for
rejecting
that
in
chapter
13
which
don't
apply
in
chapter
11.
congress'
principal
concern
in
chapter
13
was
a
concern
with
involuntary
servitude,
and
that's
reflected
in
statements
in
the
legislative
history.
and
that's
because
in
chapter
13
a
plan
must
provide
for
the
payment
of
future
wages
pursuant
to
the
plan
of
reorganization.
there
isn't
any
such
requirement
in
chapter
11
that
future
wages
be
used
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
in
fact
section
541(a)(6)
expressly
excludes
future
wages
from
property
of
the
estate.
and
so
the
concern
about
involuntary
servitude
that
was
expressed
in
the
legislative
history
just
doesn't
apply
in
chapter
11.
the
amicus
has
suggested
in
its
argument
that
the
exclusive
purpose
of
chapter
11
is
to
resuscitate
failing
businesses,
and
that
making
individuals
eligible
for
chapter
11
without
a
business
serves
no
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
we
think
that
this
is
plainly
wrong.
a
fundamental
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
to
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate,
and
there
are
instances
when
a
liquidation
or
reorganization
in
chapter
11
will
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate
versus
a
liquidation
in
chapter
7.
in
chapter
7
a
trustee
is
appointed
and
the
trustee
is
under
a
duty
presumed
to
section
704
to
liquidate
the
assets
to
cash
as
expeditiously
as
possible.
and
expeditiously
is
the
word
used
in
section
704.
in
chapter
11,
by
contrast,
in
most
cases
no
trustee
is
appointed,
and
chapter
11
offers
individual
debtors
the
flexibility
to
propose
plans
of
reorganization
which
liquidate
or
reorganize
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
and
there
were
certain
types
of
assets
which
when
sold
in
a
chapter
11...
chapter
7
setting,
in
the
forced
sale
atmosphere
that
often
accompanies
sales
by
trustees,
which
will
yield
less
in
chapter
7
than
if
they
are
sold
pursuant
to
a
chapter
11
plan.
and
i
am
thinking
in
particular
of
illiquid
assets
such
as
real
estate
or
perhaps
stock
in
a
closely
held
corporation.
if
sold
pursuant
to
chapter
7
they
may
well
yield
less,
and
the
estate
may
be
diminished
to
the
extent
that
they
yield
less.
in
addition,
an
individual
may
be
more
familiar
with
his
assets,
and
for
this
reason
can
add
value
to
the
estate.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
principal...
one
of
the
principal
assets
was
the
debtor's
causes
of
action.
and
the
individual
debtor's
participation
in
the
lawsuits
that
he
hopes
to
bring
may
be
critical
to
their
success.
and
finally,
whereas...
and
this
could
be
in
contrast
with
the
trustee
where
a
trustee
may
be
unwilling
to
pursue
a
lengthy
litigation,
and
even
if
the
trustee
is
willing
to
pursue
the
lengthy
litigation,
that
would,
that
may
not
be
the
most
efficient
way
of
pursuing
litigation
because
of
the
added
expenses
and
trustee's
fees
that
might
accompany
his
involvement
in
the
litigation.
there
is
one
other
instance
where
it
may
make
sense--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--well,
in
a--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--well,
the...
if
i
take
it
your
question
is
asked
what
is
the
individual
debtor's
motive,
the
motive
is
to
yield
as
much
as
possible
to
pay
off
his
creditors
in
full
and
hopefully
to
regain
some
of
the
value
that
may
exist
in
the
asset.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
well--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--well,
it's--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--that's
another
scenario
where
it
might
make
sense,
although
in
this
case
because
of
the
individual
debtor's
high
level
of
debt
he
wouldn't
qualify
for
chapter
13.
so
13
is
not
available,
given
those
limits.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
he
can
get
into--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--we
submit
that
he
can
get
into
chapter
11.
there
is
another
instance
where
it
may
make
some
sense
for
individuals
without
businesses
to
use
chapter
11,
and
that's
the
situation
in
which
an
individual
has
no
business
but
wants
to
get
back
into
business.
and
he
may
want
to
use
chapter
11
to
pay
off
his
creditors
so
that
he
can
have
dealings
with
them
in
the
future
and
retain
his,
as
good
a
credit
rating
as
possible.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
well,
what
he
has
to
do
is
provide
a
disclosure
statement
which
is
approved
by
the
court.
the
plan
then
must
be
approved
by
at
least
one
class
of
creditors,
which
approval
is
defined
to
include--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--well,
he
can't
scale
down
the
unsecured
creditors
to
such
an
extent
that
they
would
get
less
in
chapter
11
than
in
chapter
7--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--because
of
the
best
interest
test.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
but
he...
so
his
plan
must
at
least
provide
the
same
amount
that
a
hypothetical
chapter
7
debtor
would...
creditor
would
receive.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
that's
correct.
he
also
has
to
get
a
sufficient
vote
from
creditors
in
order
to--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--he
can
postpone
secured
creditors,
and
secured
creditors...
i
mean,
if
secured
creditors
feel
like
they
are
not
getting
as
much
as
they
are
entitled
to,
they
may,
they
can
vote
against
the
plan
and
prevent
it
from
being
confirmed.
so...
but
in
any
event--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--if
a
sufficient
number
or
amount
of
creditors
in
one
class
votes
against
it,
then
they
can
prevent
the
plan
from
being
confirmed.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
right.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
it,
i
think
it
depends
on
whether
the...
on
the
given
facts
of
the
case
and
whether,
for
example,
the
consumer
debt
and
the
mortgage
debt
are
lumped
into
one
class.
if--
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
--i
think
in...
that
secured
creditors
are
often
considered
in
a
different
class.
and
if
the
secured
creditor
is
in
a
different
class
and
votes
against
the
plan,
it...
he
can
still
prevent
the
plan
from
being
confirmed
if
he
can
establish
that
he
would
receive
less
than
he
would
in
the
chapter
7
liquidation.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
a
debtor
could
propose
that,
but
if,
for
example,
the
secured,
the
mortgagee
would
not
receive
the
same
amount
doing
the
arithmetic
that
he
would
receive
in
a
chapter
7
liquidation
and
decided
to
object,
the
plan
can't
be
confirmed,
pursuant
to
section
1129.
the
amicus'...
has...
principal
arguments
come
out
of
references
in
the
code
and
the
legislative
history
to
the
business
uses
of
chapter
11.
and,
to
be
sure,
there
are
numerous
references
in
the
code
and
the
legislative
history
to
the
business
uses
of
chapter
11.
but
we
believe
that
those
references
demonstrate
congress'
expectation
that
chapter
11
would
be
used
primarily
by
businesses.
we
don't
think
that
they
demonstrate
an
intent
to
limit
chapter
11
to
businesses.
in
fact
these...
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
state
that
chapter
11
is
primarily
designed
for
businesses,
not
exclusively.
and
they
also
both
indicate
that
consumers
will
not
use
chapter
11,
not
because
they
are
ineligible
for
chapter
11,
but
because
in
most
cases
the
procedures
are
just
too
complex.
the
house
report
also
states
that
the
report
distinguishes
between
business
debtors
and
consumer
debtors,
but
that
it
also
plainly
states
that
the
bill
itself
makes
no
such
distinction.
the
amicus
also
urge
this
court
to
be
fearful
of
the
fact
that
if
individuals
are
eligible
for
chapter
11
this
might
open
the
floodgates
to
abusive
or
bad
faith
filings.
but
there
are
numerous
protections
in
the
code
to
deal
with
situations
if
there
are
additional
bad-faith
filings
brought
upon
by
the
result
that
we
urge.
in
particular,
section
1112(b)
of
the
code
gives
the
bankruptcy
court
discretion
to
dismiss
the
case
or
convert
it
to
chapter
11...
to
chapter
7,
for
cause.
and
clearly
cause
would
include
the
bad-faith
situation
that
is
suggested.
in
fact
a
number
of
courts
are
using
section
1112(b)
to
convert
cases
to
chapter
7
in
situations
when
the
filing
is
found
to
be
in
bad
faith.
and
the
court
can
do
this,
use
section
1112(b)
at
any
time
during
a
case,
immediately
after
the
filing
up
until
the
time
when
the
plan
is
being
confirmed.
in
addition,
as
i
stated
earlier,
a
chapter
11
case
must
be
submitted
to
creditors
for
their
vote,
and
if
the
case
is
brought
in
bad
faith
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
a
plan
would
be
attractive
enough
to
creditors
that
creditors
would
give
it
the
necessary
votes.
and
finally,
again
at
chapter
11,
section
1129
of
the
code
provides
that
a
plan
cannot
be
confirmed
over
the
objection
of
any
creditors
unless
those
creditors
would
receive
the
same
amount
that
they
would
receive
in
a
hypothetical
chapter
7
liquidation.
and
so
there
are
protections
to
deal
with
the
situation
of
abusive
filings
which
might
be
brought
on
by
the
courts.
we
therefore
submit
that
congress
plainly
intended
to
make
individuals
without
businesses
eligible
for
chapter
11,
and
that
forcing
individuals
who
are
not
eligible
for
chapter
13
to
use
chapter
7
disserves
the
fundamental
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code
of
maximizing
the
value
of
the
estate.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
if
there...
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
at
this
time.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
thank
you.
mr.
peter
m.
lieb
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
unless
there
are
any
questions
that
the
court
has.
