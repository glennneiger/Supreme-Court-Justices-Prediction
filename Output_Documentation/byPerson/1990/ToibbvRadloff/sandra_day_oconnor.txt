justice
o'connor
mr.
lieb,
if
you're
right,
does
this
mean
that
consumer
debtors
can
be
placed
into
involuntary
bankruptcy
under
chapter
11
by
creditors?
justice
o'connor
why
is
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
congress
certainly
expressly
rejected
that
under
chapter
13,
didn't
it?
justice
o'connor
can
the
creditors
clearly
prohibit
the
chapter
11
plan
if
they
choose?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
all
there
is
basically
is
some
consumer
debt
and
a
home
with
a
mortgage
on
it?
justice
o'connor
can
the
holder
of
the
mortgage
prevent
the
chapter
11?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
normally
done
in
that
regard?
justice
o'connor
well,
under
chapter
11
i
take
it
the
debtor
can
propose
and
the
court
can
approve
a
lower
rate
of
interest
on
the
mortgage,
and
can
modify
the
maturity
of
the
debt?
justice
o'connor
to
what
extent
can
the
creditors
prevent
the
chapter
11
proceeding?
justice
o'connor
if
that's
so,
then
what's
the
harm
in
it?
