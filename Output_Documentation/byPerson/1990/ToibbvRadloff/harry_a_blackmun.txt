justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
we
took
it
because
of
the
conflict
in
the
lower
courts.
it
concerns
the
interplay
of
chapters
7,
11,
and
in
a
way,
13
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
specifically,
it
has
to
do
with
a
conversion
by
an
individual
of
his
chapter
seven
case
to
one
under
chapter
eleven's
reorganization
provisions.
the
bankruptcy
court
of
saint
louis
allowed
the
conversion,
but
when
the
petitioner's
reorganization
plan
was
filed,
that
court
dismissed
the
petition
finding
at
that
time
that
he
did
not
qualify
for
relief
under
chapter
11
because
he
was
not
engaged
in
an
ongoing
business.
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
affirmed
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
code's
language
permits
individual
debtors
not
engaged
in
business
to
file
for
relief
under
chapter
11.
we
acknowledge
that,
that
chapter
was
intended
primarily
for
the
use
of
business
debtors.
but
the
code
contains
no
ongoing
business
requirement
for
a
chapter-11-reorganization.
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
therefore,
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
