h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-368,
sheldon
baruch
toibb
v.
stuart
radloff.
mr.
lieb,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lieb.
mr.
marzen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
does
the
term
mr.
marzen,
as
you
just
used
it?
is
it
a
word
of
art?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
is
it
defined?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
a
mom
and
pop
store,
its
indebtedness
would
be
a
consumer
debt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they
would
be
distinct
from
one
another?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marzen.
mr.
hamilton,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hamilton,
what
is
your
response
to
a
point
made
by
mr.
marzen
that
if
we
accepted
your
contention
we
would
be
establishing
kind
of
a
very
difficult
jurisdictional
test?
how
do
we
define
when
someone
is
a
business
debtor
and
when
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
difficulty
with
having
it
such
a
heavily
factual
question
is,
of
course,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
might
rule
one
way
and
a
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
judgment
another
way,
and
you
might
just
have
a
lot
of
wheel
spinning.
chief
justice
rehnquist
courts
that
have
followed
the
eighth
circuit
rule
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
one
way
of
trying
to
ascertain
congress'
intent
once
we
start
speculating
about
it
is
to
ask
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked.
what
harm
would
come
from
consumer
debtors
utilizing
chapter
11?
they
must
have
asked
themselves
that
question,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hamilton.
we
appreciate
your
appearing
amicus
in
this
case.
mr.
lieb,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-368
toibb
against
radloff
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
