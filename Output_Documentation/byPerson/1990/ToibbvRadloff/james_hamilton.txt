mr.
james
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
may
i
begin
by
thanking
you
for
the
honor
of
appearing
before
you
as
amicus
curiae
to
defend
the
judgment
below.
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
would
have
this
court
conclude
that
this
is
a
simple
case.
they
would
have
this
court
conclude
that,
to
use
basketball
parlance,
this
is
a
slam-dunk
for
the
petitioner
because
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
they
say
that
sections
109(b)
and
(d)
do
not
exclude
consumer
debtors
who
do
not
operate
businesses
from
the
broad
group
that
may
be
debtors
under
chapter
11,
and
thus
such
consumer
debtors
may
proceed
under
that
chapter
even
though
it
is
designed
and
intended
for
business
debts.
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
issue
is
not
that
simple.
may
i
submit
that
just
because,
as
i
concede,
consumer
debtors
are
not
excluded
by
section
10...
by
the
section
109
threshold
definition,
as
the
solicitor
general
refers
to
it,
this
does
not
mean
that
consumer
debtors
may
proceed
to
obtain
relief
under
chapter
11,
for
section
109
is
not
the
only
gatekeeper
to
relief
under
chapter
11.
now
section
109(b)
and
(d)
in
essence
provide
that
persons
may
be
debtors
under
chapter
7
and
11
only
if
they
are
not
certain
entities.
now,
while
the
plain
language
of
109
does
not
exclude
consumer
debtors
from
chapter
11,
section
109
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
code
as
a
whole.
this
principle,
of
course,
is
a
commonplace
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
is
a
principle
repeated
by
this
court
in
many,
many
cases,
including
those
interpreting
the
code.
indeed
recently
this
court
said
in
reference
to
the
code
in
timbers
of
inwood
forest
that
statutory
construction
is
a
holistic
endeavor.
now,
it
is
evident
from
several
other
provisions
of
the
code
that
certain
persons
who
are
not
excluded
as
chapter
7
debtors
by
the
language
of
section
109(b)
may
not
proceed
to
relief
under
that
chapter,
and
let
me
give
you
one
example.
as
petitioner
concedes,
an
individual
consumer
debtor
who
is
able
to
pay
his
debts
cannot
proceed
to
relief
under
chapter
7.
rather,
the
case
will
be
dismissed
pursuant
to
section
707(b),
because
allowing
such
debtors
to
proceed
would
be,
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
a
substantial
abuse
of
the
provisions
of
this
chapter.
now
there
are
also
various
cases
establishing
that
while
chapter
11,
chapter
11
is
available
to
individuals
who
operate
businesses,
that
chapter
is
not
available
to
individual
consumers,
and
these
cases
are
cited
at
page
10
of
our
brief.
some
courts
have
concluded
that
a
consumer,
nonbusiness
debtor
who
attempts
to
use
chapter
11
does
not
act
in
good
faith,
and
thus
is
subject
to
dismissal
under
section
1112(b)
of
that
chapter
which
allows
dismissal
for
cause.
these
courts,
exercising
the
broad
discretion
and
the
flexibility
that
is
given
them
by
section
1112(b),
have
concluded
that
for
an
attempt
to
reorganize
or
to
rehabilitate
to
be
in
good
faith
there
must
be
something,
that
is
there
must
be
a
business
to
reorganize
or
rehabilitate,
and
if
there
is
not
dismissal
for
cause
is
appropriate.
indeed
the
statute
itself
says
that
dismissal
is
proper
in
the
absence
of
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
rehabilitation.
these
cases
under
section
1112(b)
are
consistent
with
section
1129(a)(3),
which
requires
that
reorganization
plans
be
proposed
in
good
faith.
now,
it
is
apparent
that
section
1112(b)
as
interpreted
by
these
cases
stands
as
a
further
qualification
to
the
eligibility
requirements
in
section
109.
it
is,
in
other
words,
another
gatekeeper
to
relief
under
chapter
11.
now,
it
may
be
remarked
that
section
1112(b)
does
not
specifically
require
dismissal
of
a
chapter
11
case
because
where
there
is
no
business
to
reorganize,
and
this
of
course
is
true.
but
it
is
also
true
that
section
707(b)
does
not
specifically
require
dismissal
of
a
chapter
7
case
for
substantial
abuse
where
the
debtor
has
the
ability
to
repay
his
creditors.
but
courts
nonetheless
have
had
no
trouble
reaching
this
result
by
reviewing
congress'
intent
as
evidenced
in
the
statute
and
in
the
statute's
legislative
history.
let
me
turn
then
to
those
portions
of
the
code
and
its
legislative
history
that
demonstrate
that
consumer
debtors
should
not
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
obtain
relief
under
chapter
11
even
though
they
meet
the
threshold
test
for
chapter
11
that
is
set
forth
in
section
109.
i
believe
it
is
difficult
to
dispute
that
chapter
11
was
designed
and
intended
to
provide
reorganization
relief
for
corporate
and
individual
business
debtors,
and
not
for
individual
consumer
debtors.
the
fundamental
provisions
of
chapter
11
focus
on
the
plight
of
the
business
debtor.
for
example,
sections
1107
and
1108
authorize
the
debtor
in
possession
or
the
trustee
to
operate
the
debtor's
business.
section
1103
authorizes
an
equity
security
holders
committee
to
investigate
the
operation
of
the
debtor's
business
and
the
desirability
of
the
continuation
of
that
business.
section
1106
authorizes
a
similar
investigation
into
the
debtor's
business
by
the
trustee.
and
the
list
goes
on.
other
examples
are
collected
at
pages
9
and
10
of
our
brief.
now
these
provisions
and
many
others
show
that
chapter
11
was
essentially
structured
for
the
business
debtor
and
not
for
the
consumer
debtor.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
this
is
obviously,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
factual
question.
in
this
particular
case
it
was
easy
for
the
court
to
decide
that
mr.
toibb's
debts
were
consumer
debts,
that
he
was
not
operating
a
business,
and
therefore
he
was
a
consumer
debtor
and
not
a
business
debtor.
i
believe
in
any
situation
you
will
have
a
factual
question.
but
in
many
of
the
situations
that
are
dealt
with
in
the
cases
that
we
have
cited,
the
court
had
no
difficulty
making
this
determination.
mr.
james
hamilton
you
may
have
factual
questions.
i
will
concede
that.
but
as
i
said,
courts
heretofore
have
had
no
trouble
in
making
this
determination.
mr.
james
hamilton
that's
correct,
yes.
now,
there
is
after
all
another
chapter,
chapter
13,
that
is
designed
and
intended
for
consumer
debtors.
and
i
would
suggest
that
its
very
existence
raises
questions
about
the
propriety
of
consumer
debtors
using
chapter
11.
and
it's
also
important
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
relating
to
chapter
11,
which
shows
yet
again
that
it
was
intended
solely
for
business
reorganizations.
for
example,
the
senate
report
at
page
9
says
that
chapter
11
deals
with
the
reorganization
of
a
financially
distressed
business
enterprise.
the
house
report
on
chapter
11
reorganizations
does
not
even
mention
consumer
debtors.
but
the
clearest
indication
that
chapter
11
does
not
apply
to
consumer
debtors
is
found
in
the
house
report
section
on
liquidation.
the
house
report
plainly
says
that
if
consumer
debtors
cannot
use
chapter
13,
then
chapter
7
is
the...
or
straight
bankruptcy...
is
the
only
remedy
available
to
them.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
read
this
brief
passage
which
says,
some
consumer
debtors
are
unable
to
avail
themselves
of
the
relief
provided
under
chapter
13.
mr.
james
hamilton
that
would
be
one
reason,
yes.
either
no
regular
income
or
debts
exceeding
certain
limits.
for
these
debtors
straight
bankruptcy
is
the
only
remedy
that
will
enable
them
to
get
out
from
under
the
debilitating
effects
of
too
much
debt.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
passage
could
not
be
clearer.
and
although
we
referenced
it
several
times
in
our
brief,
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
has
elided
any
mention
of
it.
i
will
concede
to
the
court
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
certain
other
passages
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
report
as
to
whether
chapter
11
is
available
to
individual
consumer
debtors.
but
this
ambiguity,
i
submit,
should
not
mitigate
the
force
of
this
precise,
this
unqualified
statement
that
i
have
just
referred
to.
moreover,
the
principal
ambiguous
passages
which
are
cited
at
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief
can
best
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
individual
business
debtors
can
use
chapter
11,
but
individual
consumer
debtors
cannot.
to
read
these
passages
to
say
that
any
individual
can
proceed
under
chapter
11,
as
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
do,
is
to
ignore
the
definitive
passage
from
the
house
report
that
i
have
just
quoted.
now,
other
code
provisions,
principally
those
in
chapter
13,
demonstrate
that
chapter
11
is
not
intended
for
consumer
nonbusiness
debtors.
chapter
13
of
course
is
the
chapter
that
allows
certain
consumer
debtors
to
devise
debt
repayment
plans,
that
allows
them
to
retain
their
assets
and
to
pay
their
creditors
out
of
future
disposable
income
over
a
3
to
5-year
period.
chapter
13
allows
only
voluntary
plans.
in
other
words,
creditors
may
not
force
debtors
into
chapter
13
debt
repayment
plans.
there
is
good
reason
for
this.
congress
wisely
recognized
that
a
debt
restructuring
plan,
in
the
words
of
the
senate
report,
only
works
where
there
is
a
willing
debtor
who
wants
to
repay
his
creditors.
now
whether
creditors
should
be
able
to
force
consumers
into
chapter
13
plans
was
a
hotly
disputed
issue
when
the
code
was
passed.
the
credit
industry
lost
in
its
attempt
to
enact
legislation
that
would
do
just
that.
but
under
chapter
11
creditors
can
force
debtors
into
involuntary
bankruptcy
plans.
consequently,
if
consumer
debtors
are
eligible
for
chapter
11
they
could
be
forced
into
such
involuntary
plans.
but
such
plans
seemingly
would
be
inherently
infeasible
if
consumer
debtors
with
no
businesses
were
unwilling
to
cooperate
with
plans
to
restructure
their
lives
and
plans
that
would
force
them
to
find
money
to
repay
their
debts.
for
example,
the
rather
unique
plan
proposed
here
would
have
no
chance
of
being
effected
unless
mr.
toibb
was
willing,
because
the
court
could
not
force
mr.
toibb
to
go
out
and
obtain
an
unsecured
loan
to
pay
off
his
creditors.
more
importantly,
it
is
oifficult
to
conclude
that
congress
would
expressly
refrain
from
forcing
consumer
debtors
into
chapter
13
plans,
and
then
turn
around
and
decide
that
consumer
debtors
could
be
forced
into
chapter
11
involuntary
plans
without
clearly
stating
the
congressional
intent
that
this
be
so.
i
also
must
observe
that
congress
decided
that
consumer
debtors
like
mr.
toibb,
with
unsecured
debts
over
$100,000
and
no
regular
income,
could
not
use
chapter
13.
it
is
difficult
to
conclude,
therefore,
that
congress
would
decide
that
such
debtors
could
nonetheless
use
chapter
11
without
being
much
more
specific
about
it.
and
to
the
contrary,
the
house
report
section
that
i
have
cited
to
you
makes
it
very
clear
that
consumer
debtors
can
only
use
chapter
13
and
chapter
7.
and
finally
there
are
additional
policy
considerations
that
counsel
against
allowing
consumer
debtors
to
use
chapter
11.
the
stated
congressional
purpose
of
chapter
11
is
to
return
businesses
to
viable
states,
to
protect
jobs,
to
protect
investors,
and
to
use
the
assets
of
the
business
to
repay
the
debtor's
debts.
and
none
of
these
laudatory
goals
is
served
by
allowing
consumer
debtors
to
reorganize
under
chapter
11.
and
i
should
say
in
response
to
mr.
lieb
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
consumer
debtors
should
be
allowed
to
use
chapter
11
in
order
to
maximize
their
assets
in
liquidation.
moreover,
to
allow
consumer
debtors
to
use
chapter
11
would
give
them
a
benefit
that
was
apparently
unintended
by
congress.
and
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
explain
this.
chapter
13
protects
the
assets
of
the
debtor,
but
it
requires
use
of
disposable
income
to
repay
a
debtor's
creditors.
chapter
7,
on
the
other
hand,
protects
post-petition
income
earned
by
personal
services,
but
not
assets,
which
must
be
liquidated
to
pay
a
creditor.
chapter
11
protects
both
assets
and
post-petition
income
earned
by
the
debtor
for
personal
services.
thus
a
punitive
chapter
11
consumer
debtor
might
protect
both
his
assets
and
his
disposable
income.
for
example,
to
allow
mr.
toibb
to
reorganize
under
chapter
11
would
allow
him
to
protect
his
stock
and
would
allow
him
to
protect
any
post-petition
income
he
might
earn
by
personal
services,
even
if
that
income
amounted
to
$100,000
or
$200,000
a
year.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
i...
assuming
that
the
plan
that
he
has
suggested
would
be
approved
by
the
court,
then
he
would
protect
his
asset,
his
stock,
he
would
protect
any
post-petition
income
he
might
make,
regardless
of
the
amount.
mr.
james
hamilton
they
would
get
the
same
thing
under
his
plan,
because...
they
would
get
$25,000,
basically,
minus
some
expenses.
mr.
james
hamilton
they
wouldn't
lose
anything
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
james
hamilton
the
time
might
be
different,
yes,
depending
on
how
long
it
took
the
plan
to
be
worked
out.
but
there
is
no
indication,
justice
white,
that
congress
intended
such
a
result
as
i
have
just
described.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
the
creditors
of
course,
classes
of
creditors
can
object
by
a
vote.
and
if
they
vote
against
it,
there
is
no
plan
unless
the
cram
down
provisions
work.
and
in
that
situation
they
would
get
at
least
what
they
would
get
in
a
chapter
7
liquidation.
mr.
james
hamilton
what
is
the
harm?
in
this
particular
circumstance
there
may
be,
it
might
be
no
harm
to
mr.
toibb's
creditors.
but
i
think
the
question,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
did
congress
intend
that
a
chapter
7...
i'm
sorry,
a
chapter
11
consumer
debtor
would
have,
a
punitive
chapter
11
consumer
debtor
would
have
the
right
to
protect
both
his
stock,
in
this
case,
and
his
post-petition
income.
mr.
james
hamilton
they
may
well
have
asked
that
question.
i
know
of
no
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
about
that
particular
question.
what
i
do
know
about,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
statement
that
i
have
quoted
to
you
that
says
the
only
provisions,
the
only
chapters
available
to
consumer
debtors
are
13
and
7.
i
would
suggest
that
the
very
fact
that
post-petition
income
is
excluded
from
the
chapter
11
estate
is
in
itself
strong
evidence
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
this
chapter
be
used
for
consumer
reorganizations,
because
such
income
is
normally
needed
to
pay
off
the
debts
of
a
bankrupt
consumer.
and
finally,
without
some
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent,
i
submit
that
the
bankruptcy
and
other
courts
should
not
be
saddled
with
the
chore
of
ruling
on
a
flood
of
consumer
debtor
chapter
11
plans
that
may
be
filed
if
this
court
clears
the
way.
it
think
it
is
not
fanciful
to
expect
that
many
of
these
consumer
plans
will
be
jerry-built,
will
be
infeasible,
and
will
be
a
burden
on
the
court.
i
suspect
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
have
enough
to
do
in
ruling
on
proposed
chapter
11
business
reorganization
plans,
almost
90
percent
of
which
fail.
if
it
please
the
court
i
will
rely
on
our
briefs
for
our
remaining
contentions.
i
will
be
most
happy
to
respond
to
any
questions
that
the
court
may
have.
