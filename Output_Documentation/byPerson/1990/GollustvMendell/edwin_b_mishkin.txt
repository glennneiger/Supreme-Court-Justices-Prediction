mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
plaintiff
can
maintain
an
action
under
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
after
ceasing
to
own
any
securities
of
the
issuer
on
whose
behalf
the
action
was
instituted.
briefly
stated,
the
facts
are
as
follows.
the
respondent,
then
a
shareholder
of
viacom
international,
inc.,
brought
this
action
under
section
16(b)
against
the
petitioners
in
january
of
1987.
in
june
of
1987
viacom
international
was
acquired
in
a
merger
transaction
in
which
the
respondent
and
other
public
shareholders
of
international
received
in
exchange
for
their
shares
in
international
a
combination
of
cash
and
a
small
amount
of
securities
in
the
acquiring
corporation,
which
became
the
parent
company
of
viacom
international,
which
in
turn
became
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
new
parent.
the
transaction
was
an
arm's
length
transaction
between
independent
parties.
it
was
approved
by
stockholder
vote.
the
petitioners
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
merger
either
in
form
or
the
substance
of
the
merger.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
justice
scalia,
that
is
correct.
i
point
it
out
because
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
there
was
some
suggestion
that
there
was
something
suspicious
in
the
timing.
in
fact
there
was
nothing
suspicious
in
the
timing.
if
the
court
looks
to
the
record
in
this
case
it
is
clear...
nor
has
the
respondent
argued
or
alleged
otherwise...
that
this
merger
was
begun
by
a
series
of
events
including
a
leveraged
buyout
proposal
made
by
the
management
long
before
this
suit
was
filed.
the
merger
was
a
culmination
of
those
events.
i
point
that
out
simply
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
analysis
of
this
case
should
begin
with
the
statute.
the
statute
says
that
an
action
may
be
instituted
by
the
issuer
or
by
the
owner
of
any
security
of
the
issuer
in
the
name
and
on
behalf
of
the
issuer.
the
statute
does
not
state
that
a
former
owner
of
an
issue
or
securities
can
sue.
indeed
neither
the
sec
nor
the
respondent
now
seem
to
be
saying
that
a
former
owner
can
sue
in
the
first
instance,
although
that--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
what
the
court
is...
must
resolve
is
whether
a
former
shareholder,
having
commenced
an
action,
loses
standing
when
he
ceases
to
be
an
owner
of
the
securities
of
the
issuer.
the
further
contention
is
made
in
this
case
that...
by
the
sec
and
the
respondent,
that
a
former
share
owner
may
lose
standing
in
some
cases
but
somehow
not
in
this
case,
because
in
this
case
the
sec
takes
the
position
and
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
because
the
shareholder,
originally
a
shareholder
of
the
issuer,
has
wound
up
a
shareholder
of
the
parent
corporation,
that
an
exception
should
be
made
to
the
statute
to
cover
this
particular
set
of
affairs.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
that's
correct.
and
that
distinction
now
seems
to
have
become,
belatedly
in
this
court,
the
linchpin
of
the
sec's
position.
in
the
court
below
that
was
not
the
distinction
on
which
the
sec
or
any
party
relied.
but
in
any
event,
if
taken
literally,
if
you
follow
that
position
literally,
what
it
would
mean
is
that
a
shareholder
can
buy
stock
immediately
before
bringing
an
action,
which
he
can
now.
he
can
go
to
the
clerk's
office,
file
his
complaint,
call
his
broker
on
the
way
out
of
the
clerk's
office,
and
thereafter
maintain
his
action
and
point
to
the
words
of
the
statute
that
said
"may
be
instituted".
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
i
think,
your
honor,
the
question
of
mootness
might
come
into
play
in
appropriate
cases,
but
what
we're
dealing
with
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it's
quite
plain
that
section
16(b)
does
not
intend,
or
was
not
intended
by
the
congress
to
go
to
the
full
length
of
the
constitutional
article
iii
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
congress
didn't
simply
say
what
we
have
done
is
we
have
created
a
statute
that
said
somebody
could
get
inside
the
courthouse
door,
and
whatever
happens
to
him
thereafter
we're
going
to
leave
up
to
the
courts
to
decide
under
constitutional
mootness
standards.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
a
shareholder
should
be
a
shareholder
of
the
issuer.
it
was
very
plain.
and
the
question
is
did
it...
means
to
say
thereafter
anybody
can
continue
suit
so
long
as
they
maintain,
no
matter
how
indirect,
an
interest.
for
example,
suppose
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
a
holder
of
some
debt,
not
a
security
at
all,
but
a
creditor.
i
suppose...
of
the
parent
corporation,
or
suppose
that
we
had
a
grandparent
corporation,
twice
removed.
you
can
pose
any
number
of
circumstances.
and
the
question
that
i
think
that
the
court
should
not
get
itself
into
is
going
through
the
varieties
of
corporate
forms
in
deciding
that
under
certain
circumstances
a
plaintiff
should
not
lose
standing--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
as
i
was--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--no,
what
i
think
i'm
saying
is
that
if
a
shareholder
turns
around
and
sells
his--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--he
didn't
do
that.
if--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--i
think
it's
inherently
in
the
concept
of
a
section
16(b)
and
a
derivative
action,
because
the
courts
have
said
in
both
contexts,
in
section
16(b)
and
in
shareholder
derivative
actions
generally,
of
which
this
is
a
variation,
that
a
shareholder
must
be
a
shareholder
of
the
issuer
corporation,
and
not
a
shareholder
of
some
parent
or
indirect
subsidiary.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
the
seventh
circuit
has
said
that.
the
ninth
circuit
has
said.
this
court
has
not
addressed
this
issue
previously.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
your
honor,
the
statute
uses
the
term
"issuer".
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
well,
if
the...
i
don't
think
what
the
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
state
that
a
shareholder
need...
his
standing
may
be
tested
or
need
be
tested
only
at
the
instant
the
suit
is
filed.
that
would
make
of
the
standing
requirement
the
sort
of
empty
formality
that
the
sec
claims
that
our
position
is.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
no,
justice
o'connor,
you
look
at
it--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--no,
those
are
questions
that
go
to
when
a
court's
jurisdiction
hatches
to
a
lawsuit
and
it
doesn't
reinvestigate
its
jurisdiction
as
a
case
proceeds.
but
this
is,
as
your
honor's
previous
question
indicated,
more
analogous
to
constitutional
requirements
of
mootness
or
case
of
controversy
where
the
court
does
in
fact
examine
whether
a
case
continues
to
be
a
viable
controversy--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--well,
i
think
this
case
is
mooted
out
insofar
as
the
statutory
words
are
concerned.
and
it
is
a
question
of
what
congress
intended.
we
are
not
maintaining
that
the
plaintiff
has
not
maintained...
does
not
have...
if
it
were
a
question
of
whether
he
had
constitutional
standing,
that
he
would
have
lost
constitutional
standing.
what
our
argument
is
is
that
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
determine
what
it
is
the
statute
intended,
the
sort
of
interest
that
a
plaintiff
would
have.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
and
the
respondent
are
both
saying
look,
we
recognize
that
the
word
"instituted"
doesn't
mean
that
you
look
at
it
only
at
the
instant
the
lawsuit
is
brought.
the
sec,
for
example,
has
attempted
to
engage
in
rulemaking
in
this
area
and
to
establish
distinctions
among
shareholders
who
have
lost
their...
lost
shares.
and
what
the
sec
has
said,
that
in
certain
instances
a
shareholder
who
has
lost
his
shares
by
virtue
of
a
merger
continues
to
have
standing,
and
certain
instances
doesn't
continue
to
have
standing.
if
the
sec
believed
that
the
word
instituted
was
all
you
needed
to
look
at,
then
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
adopt
any
such
rules.
and
indeed,
in
its
1989
rule
proposal
where
it
did
include
a
requirement
that
a
shareholder
had
brought
the
action
before
a
merger
resulted
in
the
loss
of
his
shares,
the
sec
only
applied
those
proposed
rules
to
a
merger
situation.
it
didn't
apply
it
to
a
situation
where
there
was
a
reverse
stock
split.
it
didn't
apply
it
to
a
situation
where
a
shareholder
was
confronted
with
a
cash
tender
offer
that
would
be
followed
by
a
back
end
merger,
and
said
if
he
tendered
in
the
first
stage
he
wouldn't
lose
standing.
as
far
as
i
can
understand
the
commission's
position
he
would
lose
standing.
what
difference
is
there
between
a
shareholder
who
tenders
in
the
first
step
and
a
shareholder
who
accepts
the
merger
price?
what
difference
is
there
between
a
shareholder
who
excepts
an
exchange
offer,
which
is
not
exempted
by
their
proposed
rule?
so
i
think
that
the
commission
has
clearly
and
implicitly
accepted
the
idea
that
this
statute
is
not
to
be
looked
at
at
the
instant
the
plaintiff
walks
out
of
the
courthouse
after
filing
his
complaint
and
says--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--well,
i
think
that
the
commission
actually
identified
a
statute
which,
somehow,
inexplicably
to
me,
they
cited
it
in
their
favor
which
indicated
the
statute
provided
that
a
lawsuit
could
be
instituted
against
a
certain...
secretary
of
a
government
agency,
and
went
on
to
provide
that
even
if
that,
the
identity
of
that
secretary
changed,
the
action
could
be
maintained.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
was
recognizing
that
if
the
word
"instituted"
meant,
in
that
instance,
that
you
looked
at
the
lawsuit,
at
the
inception
of
it
and
forget
about
what
happens
thereafter,
they
would
not
have
adopted
any
further
terminology.
i
think
what
the
congress
is
doing
where
it
uses
the
word
36(b)
of
the
investment
company
act
which
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
daily
income
fund
against
fox
case
was
another
such
example,
although
litigation
has
not
arisen
under
it
that
raises
this
question.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
that
was
the
intention
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
by
vesting
a
plaintiff
with
standing
to
bring
an
action.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
there
are
repeated
references
to
the
fact
that
a
shareholder
or
a
security
owner
is
given
standing
to
maintain
the
action
because
indeed
that
shareholder
has
a
financial
interest
in
achieving
a
result,
even
if
it's
an
indirect
financial
interest
as
a
shareholder
of
the
company.
so
the
idea
that
somebody
should
be
a
stranger
to
the
corporation
and
be
permitted
to
proceed
simply
because
he
was
originally
a
shareholder
and
thereafter
ceased
to
be
one
is
foreign
to
this
statute.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
the
way
i
think
the
statute
has
operated
or
worked
out
over
the
years
in
practice,
most
shareholders
indeed
have
the
interest
of
their
lawyers.
i
think
in
this
instance
we
have
such
a
circumstance,
where
in
fact
a
shareholder
brought
a
lawsuit
after
the
court
held
that
the
shareholder
had
no
standing.
he
went
out
at
the
recommendation
or
suggestion
of
his
lawyer
and
bought
some
notes
or
some
junk
bonds
that
happened
to
be
thereafter
issued
by
the
named
subsidiary
in
order
to
maintain
standing.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
well,
the
courts
regularly
award
lawyers...
plaintiffs'
lawyers
attorneys'
fees
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
yes.
and
clearly,
as
a
practical
matter
in
most
of
these
cases
the
principal
interest
is
that
of
an
attorney,
not
of
a
shareholder.
but
the
statute
itself
when
it
was
constructed,
and
it
was,
it
is
a
statute,
let
us
all
recognize,
is
a
statute
that
is
devoted
to
certain
formal
requirements.
this
court
has
recognized
the
statute
is
a
strict
liability
statute,
that
it
sometimes
operates
harshly.
although
it
is
aimed
at
preventing
the
misuse
of
inside
information,
in
fact
there
is
no
inquiry
into
whether
the
defendant
did
abuse
or
use
inside
information.
it
catches
people
who
are
not
in
fact
insiders,
never
have
been,
such
as
my
clients,
in
a
particular
company,
because
they
meet
a
certain
statutory
threshold
that
is
arbitrarily
fixed.
this
court
has
had
a
number
of
occasions
to
address
the
inflexibility
and
artificiality
of
some
of
the
provisions
of
this
statute.
in
one
of
the
early
cases
that
this
court
has
had,
blau
against
lehman,
lehman
brothers
was
regularly
trading
the
securities
of
a,
what
i
believe
was
a
client
of
lehman
brothers,
and
a
partner,
a
fairly
significant
partner
of
lehman
brothers,
mr.
thomas,
was
on
the
board
of
the
issuer
company.
and
the
court
refused,
this
court
refused
to
hold
that
lehman
brothers
as
an
entity
was
a
director
through
mr.
thomas.
that
conclusion
i
don't
think
was
self-evident
to
the
bar
before
this
court's
reading
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
the
court
took
into
account
that
this
statute
is
a
inflexible
statute
that
imposes
requirements
that
are
not
necessarily
going
to
produce
just
results
to
particular
defendants
or
to
particular
plaintiffs.
similar
approaches
have
been
taken
by
the
court
in
every
case
that
this
court
has
had,
i
believe,
involving
section
16(b).
in
the
foremost-mckesson
case
that
was
before
this
court
we
had
a
situation,
or
the
court
had
a
situation,
of
a
shareholder
who
acquired
more
than
10
percent
of
the
shares,
and
the
question...
and
therefore
would
ordinarily
be
a
statutory
insider,
and
the
question
is
when
do
you
become
an
insider.
and
you
can
arrange
your
purchases
so
that
if,
for
example,
you
wanted
to
get
16
percent
of
the
stock,
you
could
do
that
consistently
with
the
statute,
to
be
within
the
statute
or
be
without
the
statute.
for
example,
you
could
acquire
up
to
9.9
percent
and
then
look
for
a
block
of
another
8
percent.
and
if
you
acquired
your
16
or
17
percent
that
way,
when
you
sold
that
block
you
would
have
no
statutory
liability,
as
a
result
of
a
decision
of
this
court.
the
sec,
i
don't
think...
i
think
opposed
that
result
in
this
court,
but
the
court
said
look,
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
is
a
very
inflexible
one.
it
imposes
rather
strict
requirements
and
harsh
requirements,
sometimes
unjust,
and
we're
going
to
read
the
words
not
in
an
expansive,
not
in
a
broad
manner
as
the
sec
there
and
as
the
sec
here
has
contended,
but
in
a
rather
narrow
fashion,
because
we
recognize
that
it
sometimes
can
produce
undesirable
results.
we're
going
to
apply
the
words
congress
wrote
in
the
manner
in
which
congress
intended
that
they
be.
this
court
thereafter
had
a
case,
the
reliance
electric
case,
in
which
somebody
who
did
own
more
than
10
percent
of
the
shares
decided
he
would
sell
those
shares
in
two
pieces
rather
than
one.
the
first
piece
got
him
from
some
14
percent
to
9.8
percent,
and
he
paid
his
profit
back
to
the
corporation
on
those
shares.
then
he
sold
all
of
the
shares
and
paid
no
part
of
the
profit
back.
the
issue
came
to
this
court
as
wasn't
that
a
device,
wasn't
that
some
avoidance
scheme,
isn't
that
wrong.
and
the
court
said,
you
know,
under
this
statute
we're
going
to
enforce
it
the
way
it
was
written
and
let
the
sec,
who
argued
to
the
contrary
in
that
case,
do
what
they
should
do
if
it's
a
problem
with
this
statute,
if
there's
a
hole.
we,
the
court,
are
not
going
to
tinker
with
the
statute.
go
to
the
proper
forum
to
do
so,
which
is
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
and
so
the
court
in
cases
thereafter
has
also
applied
a
narrow,
not
a
broad
construction
of
the
statute
so
that--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--well,
i
think
if
you
read
this
statute
literally
you
also...
i
mean,
look,
every
statute
drawn
by
congress
requires
some
degree
of
interpretation.
one
of
the
common
characteristics
i
suppose
we
have
as
lawyers
is
that
we
read
words
and
recognize
that
they
don't
always
say
the
exact...
have
the
exact
meaning
that
one
draws
from
a
very
strict
reading
of
it.
so
the
word
"institute"
has
got
to
be
construed
in
the
context
in
which
congress
passed
this
statute.
it
was
riding
against
the
back
drop
of
derivative
actions.
now,
derivative
action
principles
that
go
back
over
a
century
in
this
court,
which
has
laid
down
the
basic
principles,
and
they
say
that
a
shareholder...
you
have
to
be
a
shareholder
of
a
corporation
to
bring
an
action.
now
that
has
been
construed
by
state
courts
and
by
federal
courts
as
meaning
that
you
need
to
own
your
shares
throughout
the
litigation,
not
that
you
should
only
have
your
shares
at
the
outset.
what
is
the
point
of
the
congress
ever
adopting
such
a
requirement
if
it
was
to
be
a
formality
that
would
be
forgotten
the
moment
the
plaintiff
leaves
the
clerk's
office?
of
course
the
court
had...
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
continuing
interest.
and
the
sec
has
recognized
that
in
its
own
rulemaking.
but
i
think
once
you
get
into
the
problem
of
under
what
circumstances
do
you
permit
somebody
who
was
formerly
a
shareholder
to
continue
to
assume
that
position,
that
is,
if
he's
a
shareholder
of
a
parent
corporation,
he
lost
his
shares
involuntarily
in
a
merger,
and
so
on,
then
i
suggest
that
what
the
court
is
being
asked
to
do
is
to
make
policy
decisions.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
those
policy
decisions
are
not
real
ones.
the
commission
has
been
struggling
with
those
policy
decisions,
and
i
think
the
problem
with
their
struggle
is
that
they
keep
coming
up
with
different
rules.
i
don't
know
if
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
correct
it,
but
if
they
do
it's
because
they
are
exercising
not
a
judicial
function
but
a
quasi-legislative
function.
this
is
a
statute,
i
think,
that
has
to
be
given
a
strict
and
a
literal
interpretation,
but
in
accordance
with
the
common
sense
with
which
it
is...
that
lies
behind
the
words.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
intended
to
say
well,
"instituted"
is
to
be
applied
and
thereafter
who
cares
whether
the
plaintiff
continues
to
have
any
standing.
for
example,
suppose
that
you
have
a
shareholder
that
is
divested
of
his
shares
in
an
all-cash
merger.
the
commission
originally
and
in
its
rules
said
well,
we're
going
to
continue
standing
for
such
a
plaintiff.
they
now
say
well,
we'll
do
that
only
if
he
sued
before
the
merger,
consistently
with
the
literalist
reading
of
the
word
"instituted".
but
does
that
make
any
real
sense?
a
shareholder
who
was
cashed
out
in
a
merger,
your
honor,
has
no
real
constitutional
jurisdiction,
for
that
matter.
the
sec
in
its
rule
would
still
have
continued
his
standing.
he
certainly
did
not
represent
any
body
of
shareholders.
and
then
suppose
that
such
a
person
sought
to
settle
a
case.
would
the
court
say
well,
you
can
go
settle
it,
and
who
cares
about
the
other
shareholders?
maybe
your
lawyer
will
get,
you
know,
a
handsome
reward,
but
you
can
turn
away
from
this
case.
no.
i
think
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
shareholder
who
had
a
certain
relationship,
a
continuing
relationship
with
the
corporation
for
which
he
was
suing
and
his
co-shareholders.
he
is
in
essence
a
fiduciary
or
a
trustee
of
this
cause
of
action.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
throughout
the
litigation,
your
honor.
throughout
the
entire
course
of
the
litigation.
and
there
is
really,
you
know...
and
your
honor,
if
there
is
to
be
some
distinctions
made,
if
we
say
that
a
shareholder
should
continue
it
throughout
the
trial
and
not
at
some
later
stage,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
tinkering
or
a
supplementing
of
the
statute
in
deciding
that
maybe
there
are
nuances
here
that
ought
to
be
fixed.
maybe
there
are
loop
holes
that
ought
to
be
plugged.
but
the
sec
has
been
able
to
address
itself
to
congress
before.
and
i
must
say
this
is
a
statute
that
is
not
only
inflexible
in
its
effect
on
people,
but
it
has
been...
when
it
was
enacted
in
1934,
after
all,
it
was
the
only
statute
that
dealt
with
the
subject
of
insider
trading.
now
i'm
not
saying
that
you
apply
a
different
interpretive
rule
because
the
law
has
developed
in
other
areas,
but
i
do
say
then,
and
this
court
has
said
in
its
adjudications
in
section
16(b)
that
there
are
other
remedies
that
plaintiffs
have
if
there
is
real
insider
trading
going
on.
there
is
10(b)(5)
that
has,
as
the
court
knows,
is
a
post-1934
developments,
although
section
10(b)
was
in
the
act.
there
is
section
14(e)
of
the
act
and
the
regulations
under
that
dealing
with
insider
trading
and
tender
offer
situations.
there
is
the
whole
range
of
insider
trading
sanctions
under
the
insider
trading
act,
where
if
you
engage
in
insider...
illegal
insider
trading
you
can
be
subject
in
effect
to
quadruple
penalties.
so
that
there
is
a
whole
panoply
of
remedies
if
we
have
a
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
is
saying
look,
i
have
a
real
insider
trading
case.
i'm
being
thrown
out
of
court
on
a
technicality.
that's
not
this
case
and
i
don't
think
we
need
argue
it,
but
the
court
has
recognized
and
taken
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
there
are
other
remedies
available
in
true
insider
trading
cases.
insofar
as
the
issue
of
whether
or
not...
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
you
had
raised
this
question,
whether
or
not
a
shareholder
of
a
parent
or
a
grandparent
corporation
has
or
should
continue
to
have
standing,
whether
he
has
a
sufficient
interest
to
permit
that
person
to
sue,
the
statute
uses
the
term
"issuer".
it
doesn't
use
the
term
"grandparent"
or
"parent".
and
indeed
the
term
1934
act
in
a
narrow
manner.
the
term
"issuer"
means
the
issuer
of
a
security
or
the
entity
that
proposes
to
issue
a
security.
and
that's
viacom
international.
when
congress
saw
fit
to
broaden
that
definition
to
include
a
parent
corporation
it
knew
how
to
do
that.
in
fact
it
did
so
a
year
earlier
in
the
1933
act,
where
the
term
issuer
was
defined
for
certain
purposes
as
including
a
parent
corporation.
that
is
to
say
was
included...
as
including
a
person
in
control
of
an
issuer.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
i
think
that
that
is
arguable,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
am
not
urging
that
as
the
rule
for
this
case.
it
is
the...
if
one
goes
to
the
full
constitutional
sweep
of
case
or
controversy
it
is
conceivable
that
a
shareholder
of
a
parent
or
a
grandparent
may
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
withstand
constitutional
attack.
i
think
that
may
be
a
case-by-case
review,
and
i
am
not
here
in
this
court
asking
for
the
court
to
make
those
distinctions.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
congress
here
did
not
intend
to
go
to
the
full
sweep
of
the
constitutional
case
or
controversy
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
and
nor
did
it
intend
to
leave
to
this
court's
constitutional
jurisdiction
the
question
of
who
had
standing
and
who
is
a
proper
plaintiff
to
commence
and
proceed
with
this
action.
that
was
a
legislative
determination
made
by
the
congress.
it
is
not
or
was
not
intended
to
be
a
determination
to
be
made
based
on
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
united
states
courts.
the
congress
clearly
did
not,
in
defining...
and
it
used
the
word
"owner
of
a
security
of
the
issuer.
"
and
i
think
you've
got
to
take
into
account
all
of
those
words.
and
the
owner
of
a
security
of
a
parent
corporation
or
a
grandparent
simply
does
not
meet
the
statutory
requirement.
let
me
address
one
other
point
that
mr.
malchman
has
made
that
the
sec
has
not.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
if
viacom
international
had
not
been...
i'm
sorry,
if
the
securities
of
viacom
international
were
used
in
exchange
so
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
received
securities
in
viacom
international,
it
was
the
succeeding
corporation
if
you
will
rather
than
the
subsidiary,
i
would
not
be
making
this
argument
because
the
statute
would
not
permit
me
to
make
this
argument,
because
the
shares
would
then
be
owned
by
a
shareholder
of
the
issuer,
viacom
international.
if
it
was
the
corporation
that
resulted
from
the
merger,
then
the
original
issuer
in
effect
would
have
been
the
acquiring
company,
and
i
wouldn't
have
made
the
argument
in
the
district
court
because
this
statute
wouldn't
permit
me
to.
the
statute
does
make
these
formal
distinctions.
it
makes
it
in
the
question
of
standing.
it
makes
it
in
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute.
it
is
a
very
formal
type
of
statute.
congress
when
it
enacted
it
recognized
that
there
were
certain
abuses
that
it
was
going
to
attempt
to
correct,
not
by
leaving
it
to
the
courts
to
make
adjudications
as
to
people's
intentions
or
bona
fides
or
male
fides.
it
was
going
to
adopt
a--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
if
viacom
were
the
corporation
resulting
from
the
merger,
viacom
international,
the
issuer
for
whom
mr.
mendell's
client
is
suing.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
right.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
and
viacom
international
has
disappeared
in
that
merger
into--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
be
making
the
argument
because
the
successor--
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
--the
question
then
becomes
who
is
the
issuer.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
and
i
think
the
courts
have
stated
that
where
the
issuer
has
disappeared
in
the
merger
into
another
company,
the
company
that
survives
that
merger
has
become
the
issuer,
has
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
issuer.
in
other
words
the
section
16(b)
cause
of
action,
like
other
causes
of
action,
survives
a
merger.
we're
not
contending
that
the
cause
of
action
is
gone.
the
cause
of
action
is
there,
and
it
can
be
asserted
by
a
party
withstanding
to
assert
it.
mr.
edwin
b.
mishkin
thank
you.
