justice
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
corporation
had
been
merged
into
the
other?
justice
white
but
you
say
if
viacom
had
been
merged
into
the
acquirer,
you
say
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument?
justice
white
no.
if
viacom
is
merged
into
another
company.
justice
white
and
the
succeeding
corporation
is
no
longer
viacom
international.
justice
white
yes.
um-hum.
justice
white
well,
the
issuer
is
no
longer
in
existence,
and
the
stockholder
can't
possibly
be
holding
stock
in
viacom.
viacom
is
gone.
justice
white
exactly.
so
why
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
white
even
though
the
stockholders
of
the
xyz
company
are
holding
stock
in
a
company
that
was
never
the
issuer?
justice
white
well,
they
may
not
be
right.
justice
white
and
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
seems
to
agree
that
he
wouldn't
be
making
an
argument...
his
argument
up
here
if
that
were
the
situation.
justice
white
um
hum.
justice
white
well,
if
a
financial
interest
in
the
parent
company
is
all
you
need,
i
don't
suppose...
i
suppose
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
he
didn't
bring...
begin
his
suit
until
after
the
merger?
justice
white
of
course,
some
of
the
arguments
in
brief
would
permit
any
holder
of
stock
in
the
parent
company
to
sue.
justice
white
a
double
derivative
suit?
justice
white
that's
all
right.
