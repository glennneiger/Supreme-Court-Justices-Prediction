justice
scalia
but
you
really
don't
think
that
matters
anyway?
i
mean,
as
far
as
your
legal
principle
that
you're
urging
upon
us
is
concerned
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference?
justice
scalia
i
wish
you
had
given
us
some
examples
of
other
federal
statutes.
i
am
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
other
federal
statutes
that
are
framed
this
way:
any
person
who
thus
and
such
may
bring
suit,
or
suit
may
be
brought
by,
which
again
has
an
initiation
flavor.
justice
scalia
why
does
the
statute
mention
the
single
derivative
action
explicitly?
i
mean,
if
you
didn't
have
to
mention
the
double,
presumably
you
wouldn't
mention
the
single.
i
mean,
the
statute
just
could
have
said
suit
to
recover
may
be
instituted
by
the
issuer,
and
then
leave
it
to
a
derivative
action
to
allow
the
single
derivative
action.
if
you
follow
me.
justice
scalia
congress
felt
it
necessary
not
to
stop
by
just
saying
suit
may
be
instituted
by
the
issuer,
which
it
could
have
said.
in
which
case,
i
suppose
you
would
be
here
arguing
well,
the
stockholder
of
the
issuer
can
sue
by
way
of
a
derivative
action.
but
congress
didn't
think
that
implication
was
enough,
and
therefore
it
went
on
to
say
not
only
the
issuer,
but
the
owner
of
any
security
of
the
issuer.
now
i
would
have
assumed
if
it
wanted
to
go
one
step
further
it
would
have
repeated
that
step
again,
or
the
owner
of
any
security
of
the
parent
of
an
issuer.
justice
scalia
that's
my
point.
they
tried
to
think
of
every
possible
situation.
if
they
had
just
said
the
issuer
your
case
would
be
a
lot
easier.
they
didn't
say
the
issuer.
they
said
the
issuer
or
a
owner
of
a
security
of
the
issuer.
justice
scalia
mr.
doty,
do
you
speak
just
for
the
sec
here
or
do
you
speak
for
the
government
more
generally?
is
the
government
willing
to
accept
that
position
with
respect
to
all
statutes
that,
when
they
say
somebody
can
institute
suits
with
a
certain
characteristic
they
can
continue
it,
whether
they
retain
that
characteristic
or
not?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
sufficiency
of...
i'm
not
talking
about
the
article
iii
point.
i'm
talking
about
the
plain
language
point
you
were
addressing.
justice
scalia
for
example,
is
the
government
willing
to
accept
that
under
the
judicial
review
provision
of
the
federal
labor
management
relations
act,
when
it
says
any
person
aggrieved
by
any
final
order
of
the
authority
may
institute
an
action
for
judicial
review,
that
that
person,
even
if
the
person
later
does
not
meet
the
aggrieved
by
any
final
order
requirement
which
is
somewhat
above
the
article
iii
minimum,
that
person
may
continue
to
maintain
the
suit
nonetheless?
justice
scalia
but
plain
language
is
plain
language.
justice
scalia
i
expect
that's
a
very
common
statute.
i
just,
i
just
picked
this
up
while
we've
been
sitting
here.
i
sent
for
the
book
and
just
flipped
through
it
and
came
across
the
federal
labor
management
relations
act.
i
suppose
one
can
find
scores
of
statutes
that
are
framed
that
way.
and
if
it
indeed...
i
like
plain
meaning.
but
if
that
is
plain
meaning,
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
that
i
think
may
have
to
be
interpreted
differently
from
what
i
have
understood
to
be
the
practice.
justice
scalia
we
would
have
to
presumably
go
through
a
brainstorming
session
on
article
iii
standing.
maybe...
maybe
his
aged
mother
owns
a
share
and
whether
that
would
be
enough
of
an
interest
would
become
a
question
in
every
case,
in
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
statute
congress
has
written.
all
you
need
is
the
interest
they
are
concerned
about
at
the
outset
of
the
suit,
and
after
that
any
interest
at
all
that
possibly
meets
article
iii
standing
is
going
to
be
enough.
i
mean,
it's
possible
to
write
a
statute
that
way,
but
it
seems
like
a
very
strange
statute
to
me.
justice
scalia
mr.
doty,
i
suppose
wisdom
is
to
be
welcomed
whenever
it
comes,
but
this
plain
language
point
did
not
occur
to
the
commission
when
it
issued
its
proposed
rules
on
this
area,
right,
and
did
not
even
occur
to
the
commission
when
litigating
this
case
below.
am
i
correct
that
this
is
the
first
time,
before
this
court,
that
the
commission
is
arguing
for
this
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
scalia
did
it
make
this
plain
language
argument?
i
thought
your-position
below
was
much
more
sweeping
than
this...
that
you,
that
it
did
not
refer
to
a
current
owner.
it
mean...
it
meant
a
present
or
former
owner.
wasn't
that
your
position
below?
justice
scalia
i'll
accept
that.
you--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
--are
you
sure
the
commission
can
issue
rules
as
to
when
suits
are
bringable
in
court?
is
that
an
area
of
commission
rulemaking
at
all?
