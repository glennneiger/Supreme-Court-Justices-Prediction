no,
but
mr.
mishkin,
the
question...
you're
right.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
shareholder
of
a
parent
of
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
continues
to
have
standing
when
he
did
have
standing
at
the
time
he
instituted
the
suit.
that's
the
only
issue
here,
isn't
it?
and
what
in
the
statute
says
he
loses
standing?
justice
stevens
you're
worried
about
a
lot
of
other
cases,
not
this
one.
justice
stevens
but
he
didn't
do
that.
justice
stevens
what
in
the
statute
defeats
his
right
to
continue
an
action
that
was
properly
instituted?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
what's
in
the
16(b)
context.
the
second
circuit
has
said
that
repeatedly,
but
we
have
never
said
that.
justice
stevens
and
the
statutory
language
doesn't
say
that.
justice
stevens
and
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
justice
stevens
referring
to
the
point
of
instituting
the
suit.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
mishkin,
isn't
it
true
that
all
those
cases...
i'm
not
sure
the
words
narrow
and
broad
are
correct...
all
those
cases
gave
a
very
technical,
literal
reading
to
the
statute.
and
if
we
just
read
this
statute
literally
it
only
focuses
on
the
time
the
case
is
instituted.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
any
owner
of
any
security
of
a
parent
of
the
issuer,
which
could
have
been
a
little
broader.
justice
stevens
they
might
have
thought
it.
it's
not
that
hard
to
think
of,
is
it?
justice
stevens
well...
never
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
doty,
can
i
ask
you
how
your
plain
language
argument
would
work
if
the
plaintiff
was
a
shareholder
when
he
gave
notice
to
the...
he
made
a
demand,
and
then
before
the
60-day
period
when
the
directors
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
the
demand
the
merger
took
place,
and
then
he
filed
suit
after
the
merger
took
place
and
was
no
longer
a
shareholder.
would
he
have
standing?
justice
stevens
my
question
was
what
does
your
plain
language
argument
do
with
that
hypothetical?
does
it
come
within
or
without
the
plain
language
as
you
read
it?
justice
stevens
not
at
the
time
he
instituted--
justice
stevens
--the
merger
intervened
between
the
demand
and
the
filing
of
the
suit.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
know
what
your
point--
