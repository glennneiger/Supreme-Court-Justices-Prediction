justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mishkin,
in
this
case
wasn't
the
plaintiff
an
owner
at
the
time
the
suit
was
initiated?
justice
o'connor
so
all
we
have
to
resolve
is
whether
it's
now
moot
or
he
has
lost
standing?
what
is
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
ordinary
principles
of
mootness
come
into
play
there?
here
you
have
a
plaintiff
who
can
be
said
to
have
a
continuing
financial
interest.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mishkin,
in
diversity
cases
do
we
look
at
diversity
of
the
parties
as
of
the
initiation
of
the
lawsuit,
and
if
it
disappears
later
do
we
say
there
is
no
standing?
justice
o'connor
or
the
amount
in
controversy
cases?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
entirely,
it's
entirely
possible
that
a
case
filed
under
this
16(b)
section
could
later
become
moot,
i
suppose.
so
our
question,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
is
whether
this
case
has
mooted
out.
justice
o'connor
well,
my
question
was
really
whether
you
thought
that
under
ordinary
principles
of
mootness
it
could
be
said
that
someone
who
ends
up
at
the
end
of
the
day
with
stock
in
the
parent
can
be
said
to
have
no
financial
interest.
justice
o'connor
well,
would
you
at
least
concede
that
in
the
situation
the
chief
justice
inquired
about
that
the
cases
become
moot?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
case
where
the
plaintiff
buys
a
share
of
stock
on
day
1,
files
suit
on
day
2,
sells
it
on
day
3.
justice
o'connor
just
serious
questions?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
just
wondered
what
the
position
of
the
sec
was.
is
it
moot
or
is
it
not?
justice
o'connor
what's
your
position
as
general
counsel
of
the
sec
on
that
question.
justice
o'connor
has
it
become
moot
or
not
become
moot
when
the
stock
is
sold,
in
your
view?
