section
16d
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
requires
corporate
insiders
to
account
to
the
corporation
for
short
swing
profits
upon
suit
either
by
the
corporation
or
by
a
holder
of
one
of
its
securities
suing
on
the
corporations
behalf.
the
respondent,
mendell,
owned
stock
in
viacomm
international,
inc.
which
i
will
refer
to
as
international.
he
sued
petitioners
under
section
16b
alleging
that
they
were
insiders
by
virtue
of
collective
ownership
of
more
than
10%
of
internationals
listed
stock
and
that
they
had
earned
a
profit
by
short
seeing
trading
in
its
common
stock.
after
respondent
filed
his
complaint,
international
was
acquired
by
viacomm,
inc.
by
the
terms
of
the
acquisition,
the
shares
of
international
were
exchanged
for
cash
and
stock
in
viacomm.
petitioners
then
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
respondents
16b
action
on
the
ground
that
he
no
longer
owned
any
security
issue
by
international
as
distinct
from

in
internationals
new
parent,
viacomm.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion.
the
respondent
appealed
and
the
second
circuit
reversed.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit.
the
text
of
section
16b
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
confer
standing
a
signal
breath
on
security
holders
of
corporations
whose
insider
took
profit
it
from
short-swing
trading.
bringing
suit
under
the
statute,
a
plaintiff
must
own
a
security
of
the
corporation
or
issuer
at
the
time
suit
is
instituted.
any
security
will
suffice.
the
statute
does
not
restrict
standing
by
requiring
any
minimum
number
or
percentage
of
shares
or
any
minimum
value
of
any
other
security
to
be
held,
nor
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
own
a
security
at
the
time
of
the
insider
trading
or
continue
to
own
it
after
instituting
suit.
this
is
not
to
say
that
a
plaintiff
can
maintain
a
16b
action
after
he
has
divested
of
any
interest
on
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
we
conclude
that
congress
understood
and
intended
that
throughout
the
period
of
participation
in
16b
litigation,
the
plaintiff
authorize
to
sue
insiders
on
behalf
of
an
issue
that
would
have
some
continuing
financial
stake
at
the
litigations
outcome
both
to
insure
vigorous
enforcement
of
a
statute
and
to
avoid
the
serious
constitutional
question
that
would
arise
from
a
plaintiffs
loss
of
all
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
he
had
begun.
in
this
case,
we
conclude
that
the
continuing
financial
stake
required
by
the
statute
is
satisfied
by
respondents
ownership
of
stock
in
the
original
issue
as
new
parent
corporation.
since
respondent
own
stock
in
the
issuer
when
he
instituted
suit
and
was
left
after
the
corporate
restructuring
with
stock
and
the
issue
was
new
parent
corporation,
he
has
at
all
time
satisfied
the
standing
requirements
of
section
16b.
