mr.
james
r.
doty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
believes
that
the
guiding
principle
for
determining
standing
under
section
16(b)
of
the
exchange
act
resides
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
in
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
section
16(b)
to
create
an
express
private
right
of
action.
as
to
this
statute,
it
is
the
commission's
position
first
that
the
plain
language
of
section
16(b)
directs
the
maintenance
of
standing
here
as
that
language
is
unambiguous
in
its
grant
of
standing
to
institute
suit
to
a
broad
class
of
security
holders.
nothing
else
in
the
language
of
section
16(b)
or
anywhere
else
in
any
other
provision
of
the
exchange
act
limits
that
grant
of
standing
or
permits
a
gloss
of
a
continuous
ownership
requirement
on
the
statute.
mr.
james
r.
doty
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
in
the
context
of
this
statute
my
statement
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
grant
of
standing
in
this
statutory
context
is
one
which
the
government
shares.
as
our
brief
notes,
we
in
the
government
recognize
that,
at
some
point
in
the
determination
of
an
interest
in
a
lawsuit,
article
iii
considerations
do
arise,
but
we
in
the
government,
in
the
solicitor's
general
office,
share
the
view
that
in
this
case
plaintiff
mendell's
continuing
economic
interest
in
the
issuer
and
in
the
lawsuit
which
the
security
in
its
parent
represents
is
entirely
sufficient
for
purposes
of
article
iii.
mr.
james
r.
doty
yes.
mr.
james
r.
doty
justice
scalia,
the
commission
would
not
want
to
speak
for
the
government
in
these
other
contexts.
we
would
not
want
to
purport
to
be
representing
their
position
on
these
other
statutes.
mr.
james
r.
doty
plain
language
being
plain
language
here,
we
rest
strongly
on
the
notion,
or
on
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
that
one
who
institutes
the
suit
need
only
be
a
security
holder.
we
believe
that
this,
that
the
statutory
purpose
in
enacting
16(b)
in
this
case
comports
with
that
reading
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
this
is
a
statute
which,
if
the
structure
and
the
procedures
of
the
statute
are
carefully
examined,
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
to
legislate
the
elements
of
a
private
cause
of
action,
including
the
procedures
whereby
a
security
holder
went
about
getting
that
lawsuit
before
the
courts.
so
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
congress
has
conferred
on
any
private
citizen
or
where
the
arguable
language...
the
arguable
interpretation
of
the
language
could
be
that
congress
had
intended
to
confer
on
any
concerned
bystander
the
right
to
institute
suit.
mr.
james
r.
doty
we
believe
that
as
statutory
standing
for
the
purposes
of
16(b),
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
the
defendants
in
this
case
are
arguing
that
their
right
of
continuous
ownership,
or
this
gloss
of
continuous
ownership,
is
implicit
in
the
statute.
we
think
that
one
does
not
have...
one
need
not
look
to
this
implicit
gloss
in
the
statute,
that
the
statute's
policy
is
clear
that
it
intended
to
authorize
the
instituting
of
suits
by
one
who
was
an
owner
of
a
security--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--i
think
certainly
congress
recognized
that
the
policing
power,
the
enforcement
policy
of
the
statute
overcame
what
mr.
mishkin
has
attempted
to
characterize
as
a
common
sense
concern
here.
that
congress
was
comfortable
with
the
notion
that
article
iii
concepts
of
continuing
interest
in
the
outcome
of
litigation
and
the
ability
to
vigorously
advocate
a
position
on
behalf
of
a
representation
undertaken
would
be
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
one
must
remember
congress
was
writing
against
a
very
dark
tapestry
of
insider
trading
here
in
which
the
purpose
was
to
get
these
suits
brought
and
litigated.
mr.
james
r.
doty
justice
o'connor,
we
can
easily
see
that
cases
may
come
before
the
federal
courts
in
which--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--we
think
that
serious
questions
of
an
interest
in
the
outcome
and
mootness
would
be--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--would
be
addressed
there.
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
would...
the
commission
would
view
that
case
as
one
which
should
be
addressed
by
this
court
in
the
full
set
of
circumstances
that
it
presents.
one
may
imagine,
for
example,
instances
of
fraud--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--justice
o'connor,
we
do
not
have
a
position
in
the
abstract
on
whether
that
case
would
necessarily
be
moot.
mr.
james
r.
doty
your
honor,
my
own
view
of
the
statutory
standing
here
is
that
the
statutory
standing
in
that
case
is
clear
that
issues
would
be--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--it
is
possible
that
it
is
not
moot.
it
is...
there
are
facts
which
could
be
developed
which
would
not
render
that
instance
one
of
mootness.
mr.
james
r.
doty
but,
justice
scalia,
congress
has
in
fact
made
clear
that
it
in
fact
intends
to
deal
with
the
potential,
the
possibility
for
abuse
in
the
misuse
of
inside
information,
and
that
to
do
that
it
has
sought
to
confer
standing
on
security
holders
to
bring
the
lawsuits.
it
does
not
follow,
in
our
view,
that
congress
necessarily
was
blind
to
the
implications
of
eventual
article
iii
questions
of
mootness.
but
this
court
resolves
those
questions
frequently
and
the
cases,
even
in
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
the
cases
that
could
arise
under
this
statute
don't
necessarily
pose
questions
of
mootness
that
are
any
more
difficult
than
the
questions
this
court
faces
in
other
federal
contexts.
the
mootness
issue
does
arise
from
time
to
time,
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case
this
plaintiff
has
no
difficulty
meeting
that
test
of
continuing
economic
interest.
the
corporation
whose
securities
he
now
holds
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
this
transaction.
it
engaged
in
no
business
activities
until
it
engaged
in
the
financing
of
this
transaction.
the
issuer
has
been,
so
far
as
we
can
determine
from
the
papers,
the
sole
asset
of
this
corporation.
so
in
many
ways
mendell's
interest
in
the
parent
is
an
indirect
but
very
strong
economic
equivalent
of
the
security
of
the
issuer
he
originally
held.
we
would
urge
on
the
court
the
plain
language
of
6...
of
section
16,
but
also
the
purposes
for
which
the
statute
was
originally
adopted.
and
the
argument
which
we
feel
that
the
defendants
here
are
advancing
to
the
court,
which
is
that
on
the
basis
of
derivative
analogies
which
we
feel
do
not
fairly
apply
that
the
court
carve
out
a
statutory
exception
to
the
ability
of
a
16(b)
plaintiff
to
continue
to
litigate
his
case.
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
warrants
carving
out
that
exception
in
this
case
and
on
these
facts.
the
time
and
the
place
in
which
the
court
should
consider
what
the
extent
of
an
economic
interest
is
that
would
satisfy
or
fail
to
satisfy
article
iii
considerations
or
mootness
considerations
should
be
reserved
for
another
time.
the
plaintiff...
the
defendants,
rather,
in
this
case
place
great
store
by
derivative
analogies.
their
only
source
for
that
purported
analogy...
for
that
purported
statutory
gloss
based
on
the
analogy,
is
to
the
rules
that
govern
derivative
suits.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
those
really
are
not
appropriate
here.
if
one
examines
the
structure
again
of
the
statute,
it
is
quite
clear
the
derivative
analogy
simply
does
not
apply.
the
opening
words
of
section
16(b)
state
that
it
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may
have
been
obtained.
now
that
stands,
we
would
submit,
in
stark
contrast
to
the
compensatory
or
the
indemnificatory
natures
of
derivative
actions.
section
16(b)
is
manifestly
broader.
creditor
holders
of
securities
and
not
merely
shareholders
can
institute
these
suits.
directors
cannot
refuse
a
demand...
cannot
by
refusing
demand
terminate
the
suit.
where
congress
intended
that
one
hold
the
security
for
purposes
of
being
a
defendant,
it
was
quite
clear
in
the
statute
that
congress
intended
one
be
a
10
percent
holder
of
the
security
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
the
time
of
the
sale,
which
are
being
matched
for
the
purposes
of
liability.
so
congress
knew
how
to
address
questions
of
timing
of
security
holdings
when
it
considered
that
important
for
granting
the
requisites
of
the
statute,
when
invoking
the
enforcement
apparatus
of
the
statute.
and
they
did
not
do
so
with
the
maintenance
requirement.
mr.
james
r.
doty
well,
with
all
respect,
justice
scalia,
we
believe
our
brief
to
the
second
circuit
in
fact
makes
the
plain
language
argument,
and
we
believe
also
that
the
second
circuit
opinion
reaches
the
right
result
and
contains
the
right
reasons--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--it
is
true...
i
believe
it
is
fair,
your
honor,
that
we
have
refined
our
argument
in
this
court,
and
we
believe
that
is
something
which
the
appellate
process
permits--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--with
respect
to
our
rules,
however,
i
would
only
note
that
our
rules
were
not
an
attempt
to
exhaust
the
area
of
standing.
they
were
put
out
for
comment.
the
fact
that
we
have
not
adopted
a
rule
on
this
area
in
our
view
does
not
deprive
the
commission's
position
today
as
to
the
standing
of
this
plaintiff
of
any
merit
or
any
validity.
and
we--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--our
footnote
11
in
our
brief,
justice
stevens,
recognizes
the
problems
with
that
factual
hypothetical.
and
with
that
situation
and
with
justice
o'connor's
situation
the
commission
is
principally
concerned
with
questions
of
whether
there
have
been
coercion,
fraud,
unusual
circumstances--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--that
is...
that,
we
believe,
is
a
case
in
which
the
security
holder
had,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
he
had
standing.
he
would
have
been
able
to
bring
the
suit--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--but
the
merger
intervened.
mr.
james
r.
doty
candidly,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
is
an
area
where
the
commission's
rulemaking
authority
could
provide
clarification
and
certainty,
and
it
would
be
entitled
to
deference
by
this
court.
mr.
james
r.
doty
that
was
in
fact
the
area
of
concern
addressed
by
the
rule
of
proposals.
we
pulled
back
from
that
because
we
had
not--
mr.
james
r.
doty
--your
honor,
this
court
has...
to
this
general
counsel's
knowledge
this
court
has
not
considered
that
issue.
and
it
is
clearly
one
that
would
have
to
be
considered.
