we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
90-659,
keith
r.
gollust
v.
ira
l.
mendell.
mr.
mishkin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
mishkin--
--well,
is
that
strictly
speaking
an
exception
to
the
statute?
i
mean,
the
language
of
the
statute
just
says
a...
an
act...
a
suit
to
recover
such
profit
may
be
instituted
by
the
owner
of
any
security
of
the
issuer.
now,
this
suit
was
instituted
by
an
owner
of
the
security,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
plaintiff's
only
motive
in
a
case
like
this
to
increase
the...
increase
indirectly
and
incrementally
the
value
of
his
own
shares?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what's
the
incentive?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
there
would
be
much
incentive
to
a
small
shareholder.
do
you
get
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
the
lawyer
benefit
if
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
the
common
fund
theory?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
long
would
you
say
he
had
to
keep
the
shares,
as
you
read
the
word
instituted
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you
have
adequately
answered
the
question,
mr.
mishkin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
malchman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
malchman.
mr.
doty,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
do
agree,
mr.
doty,
i
guess,
with
mr.
mishkin...
i
mean
with
his
statement
of
your
position
that
it
would
be
enough
if
the
plaintiff
had
bought
a
share
of
stock
the
day
before
he
filed
his
lawsuit
and
sold
it
the
day
afterwards,
so
far
as
what
congress
demands
in
the
way
of
standing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
congress
was
indifferent
to
what
the
plaintiff
did
with
the
security
after
he
instituted
the
suit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
doty.
the
case
is
submitted.
