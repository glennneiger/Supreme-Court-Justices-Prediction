mr.
irving
malchman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
going
to
proceed
in
a
kind
of
disorganized
manner
because
i
have
a
couple
of
things
i
want
to
say
right
at
the
beginning.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
do
is
ask,
is
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question.
if
the
abc
company
is
merged
into
the
xyz
company,
the
cases
are
clear
that
a
stockholder...
any
stockholder
of
the
xyz
company
can
sue
under
16(b)
for
a
transaction
that
took
place
in
the
stock
of
the
abc
company
before--
mr.
irving
malchman
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
there
are
two...
there
are
decisions
to
that
effect.
for
example,
newmark
v.--
mr.
irving
malchman
--no,
we
were
in
the
court
of
last
resort,
but
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question.
and
the
cases
hold
that
in
that
situation
the...
as
i
said,
any
shareholder
of
the
xyz
company
could
sue
under
16(b)
even
though
the
xyz
company
is
not
the
issuer
and
even
though
the
plaintiff
shareholder
of
the
xyz
company
never
owned
stock
of
the
issuer.
mr.
irving
malchman
that's
the
way
i
heard
it,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
malchman
now,
the
next
thing
i
would
like
to
say
out
of
order
or
out
of
sequence
is
that
my
opponent
mentioned
at
least
five
or
more
times
congressional
intent.
the
intent
of
congress...
let
me
back
up.
it
is
manifest
from
the
face
of
section
16(b)
itself
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
confer
as
broad
standing
upon
a
plaintiff
shareholder
who
sues
under
16(b)
as
possible.
for
example,
the
congress
said
that
any
owner
of
a
security,
not
stock,
any
owner
of
a
security
of
the
issuer
could
sue
under
16(b),
which
is
much
broader
than
the
ordinary
derivative
action
where
one
has
to
own
stock
of
the
company
in
question.
secondly,
the
congress
provided--
mr.
irving
malchman
--if
they
thought
of
it
they
may
have
said
it,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
malchman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
irving
malchman
so,
as
i
said,
it's
palpable
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
cast
standing
in
as
broad
a
compass
as
possible,
and
i
gave
the
example
that
congress
didn't
confine
standing
to
stock
owners.
also
there
is
no
requirement
under
16(b)
that
the
security
owner
owned
a
security
contemporaneously
at
the
time
of
the
violation.
and
that
is
another
rule
in
ordinary
derivative
actions
which
is
not
the
case
in
16(b).
thirdly,
congress
made
it
clear
in
16(b)
that
the
shareholder
is
not
bound
by
the
business
judgment
of
the
issuer
not
to
sue,
which
of
course
is
not
the
situation
in
ordinary
derivative
actions.
so,
my
submission
to
the
court
is
it's
as
if
congress
had
explicitly
written
in
16(b)
that
we
want
shareholder
standing
to
be
as
broad
as
possible,
and
further
that
if
congress
had
been
presented
by
this
case
when
it
enacted
the
statute
it
would
surely
have
opted
for
standing.
now,
to
return
to
the
formal
argument,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple.
first,
the
plaintiff
owned
the
stock
of
the
issuer
at
the
time
he
commenced
this
16(b)
action,
so
that
he
satisfied
the
requirement
of
16(b)
that
he
be
the
owner
of
any
security
issuer
at
the
time
of
institution
of
suit.
secondly,
in
the
merger
by
which
the
issuer
became
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
another
company,
that
is
the
parent
company,
the
plaintiff
received
stock
as
a
result
of
the
merger
in
the
parent
company,
so
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
continuing
financial
interest
to
maintain
a
16(b)
action
in
this
case.
and
further,
since
plaintiff's
16(b)
action
had
been
commenced
prior
to
the
merger
and
was
pending
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
this
case
presents
the
possible
danger
of
a
restructuring
intentionally
designed
to
defeat
section
16(b).
now--
mr.
irving
malchman
--no,
i
wouldn't,
your
honor,
but
financial
interest
in
the
parent...
financial
interest
is
just
one-half
of
the
situation.
the
other
half
of
the
situation,
that
he
was
an
owner
of
a
security
of
the
issuer
at
the--
mr.
irving
malchman
--i
certainly
don't,
didn't
intend
to
imply
that,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
if
i
may,
i'm
going
to
come
to
that.
mr.
irving
malchman
all
right.
i
don't
want
to
be
too
disorganized.
so...
now
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals
decisions
in
this
area,
and
there
are
only
four
of
them,
all
involved
cash-out
mergers,
every
single
one
of
them,
which
presented
a
situation
where
the
shareholder
of
the
issuer
who
was
cashed
out
no
longer
had
a
continuing
financial
interest
in
the
16(b)
suit
in
question.
moreover,
in
two
of
those
four
courts
of
appeals
decisions,
the
plaintiff
had
never
been
a
shareholder
of
the
issuer.
so
the
four
other
courts
of
appeals
decisions
in
this
area
are
totally
inapposite
here.
now,
if
in
this
case
the
issuer
had
merged
into
the
parent
or
the
parent
had
acquired
the
assets
of
the
issuer,
plaintiff's
16(b)
standing
would
be,
would
have
been
unimpaired.
it
is
simply
happenstance
insofar
as
16(b)
considerations
are
concerned
that
the
issuer
became
a
subsidiary
of
the
parent
instead
of
merging
into
the
parent
or
instead
of
its
assets
being
purchased
by
the
parent.
now,
i
want
to
come
to
a
kind
of
distinct
point,
and
that
is
that
the
corporate
distinction
between
the
issuer
and
the
parent
in
this
case
should
be
disregarded
for
the
purposes
of
16(b).
the
issuer...
the
only
asset
of
the
issuer...
let
me
strike
that,
please.
the
only
asset
of
the
parent
which
was
formed
as
a
shell
corporation
to
hold
the
issuer
is
the
issuer.
the
parent
holds
and
conducts
the
issuer's
business
through
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
the
issuer,
so
that
the
business
reality
is
that
the
issuer's
assets
belong
to
the
parent,
including
the
issuer's
16(b)
claim
against
defendants.
this
court,
in
cases
that
were
cited...
are
cited
in
my
brief,
have
held
that
corporate
form
may
be
disregarded
where,
as
here,
it
produces
an
inequitable
result
such
as
the
defeat
of
a
statute
of
public
policy,
even
to
the
extent
of
imposing
liability
upon
the
parent
shareholders,
and
even
though
the
parent
was
organized
in
good
faith
and
was
not
a
sham.
now,
on
the
point
of
the
double
derivative
action,
this
16(b)
case
is
maintained
not
only
as
a
single
derivative
action,
but
as
a
double
derivative
action
whereby
the
plaintiff
enforces
derivatively
the
parent's
derivative
right
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
issuer
under
16(b).
the
commentators,
and
that's
professor
laws
and
professor
blumberg,
state
that
there
is
no
reason
why
under
16(b)
double
derivative
actions
should
be
singled
out
for
nonmaintainability.
that
is
there
is
no
good
reason
why
a
double
derivative
action
should
not
be
maintainable
in
the
context
of
16(b).
in
the
double
derivative
action,
a
shareholder
is
enforcing
the
shareholder's...
the
issuer's
right
to
sue
under
16(b).
that
is
a
shareholder
is
enforcing
the
parent's
right
to
sue
under
16(b),
the
parent's
right
as
a
shareholder
of
the,
of
the...
the
parent's
right
as
a
shareholder
of
the
issuer.
the
congress
which
drafted
16(b)
would
have
welcomed
the
double
derivative
action
if
presented
with
the
question.
mr.
irving
malchman
well--
mr.
irving
malchman
--mr.
justice
scalia,
when
one
writes
a
statute
one
can't
think
of
every
possible
situation--
mr.
irving
malchman
--but
they
said
both.
they
said
not
only
the
shareholder
of
the
issuer,
but
they
said
the
issuer
as
well.
so
it's
a
double-barrelled
provision.
i
think
i
have
finished.
thank
you.
