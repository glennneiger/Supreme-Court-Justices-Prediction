mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
florida
is
known
in
the
bankruptcy
parlance
as
a
debtors
state,
and
it
is
called
that
because
it
is
unusually
generous
in
terms
of
the
exemptions
that
it
grants.
under
the
federal
scheme
of
exemptions
in
522(d),
only
20,
only
$7,500
would
be
available
for
a
homestead
exemption.
in
florida
there
is
an
acreage
limitation,
but
the
amount
is
unlimited.
now,
essentially
what
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
suggesting
is
that
congress,
in
section
522(f),
was
intending
to
force
the
states
to
be
more
generous
than
they
decided
to
be.
i
think
there
is--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--it's
a
piece
of
property.
in
rural
areas
it's
160
acres,
in
urban
areas
it's
a
half
an
acre.
and
what
you
have
here
with
respect
to
the
first
argument
that
we
make
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
exemption
on
which
522(f)
can
operate,
is
an
agreement
between
the
petitioner
and
respondent
that
to
the
extent
that
this
property
is
covered
by
a
lien
it
is
simply
not
exempt
by
virtue
of
section
522(b).
there
is
no
exemption
to
the
extent
that
the
property
is
covered
by
a
lien.
and
our
suggestion
is
that
522(f)
simply
has
nothing
on
which
to
operate
under
these
circumstances,
because
it
only
applies
when
it
would
impair
an
exemption
to
which
the
debtor
is
otherwise
entitled.
there
isn't
any
exemption--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--the,
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
not
quite--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--what
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no.
well,
what,
what
the
bankruptcy
court
did,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
this
opinion
of
the
bankruptcy
court
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
but
what
the
bankruptcy
court
said
was
this
property
is
exempt
from
the
claims
of
unsecured
creditors,
and
i
am
not
going
to
decide
initially--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
didn't--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
correct.
and
what
happened
was
when
the
exemption
was
claimed,
the
respondent
filed
an
objection
to
that
exemption
on
the
very
ground
that
we
are
talking
about
now.
the
respondent
said
there
is
no
exemption
available
here
to
the
extent
that
this
property
is
subject
to
the
lien,
because
that
is
the
way
florida
law
defines
the
exemption.
and
the
bankruptcy
court,
in
our
view,
didn't
quite
look
at
it
correctly.
it
said
well,
i
am
going
to
rule
that
there
is
an
exemption,
but
i
am
not
going
to
decide
the
lien
question.
in
our
view--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
don't
think
it
was
appealable,
because
it
wasn't
an
adverse
judgment
against
us.
he
hadn't
decided
the
lien
question.
there
wasn't
a
final
judgment
that
would
have
been
appealable.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
he
reserved
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that's
correct,
and
that
is
what
we
said
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
he,
and
what
he
said
was
well,
i
am
going
to
view
this
as
exempt
from
the
claims
of
general
creditors,
but
i
am
not
going
to
reach
the
question
of
what
the
effect
of
that
is
on
the
lien.
there
wasn't...
he
reserved
that
for
the
future.
he
didn't
decide
that
until
some
future
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
very...
early
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
what,
what
happens
is
there
is
a
schedule
of
property
filed
as
part
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
the
condominium
that
is
at
issue
here
was
listed
there
and
an
exemption
was
claimed
for
it.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
right
on
the
schedule.
and
there
was
an
objection,
as
required
by
the
rules,
filed--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes.
there
was
an
objection
filed
with
respect
to
that
exemption
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
exemption
available
under
florida
law
to
the
extent
of
the
lien.
and
the
bankruptcy
court
ultimately
got
around
to
resolving
that
question
in
a
later
ruling
in
the
course
of
the
case
rather
than
in
this
earlier
ruling.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
oh,
absolutely.
there
is
not
question
about
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
stevens,
i
was
not
agreeing
that
it
is
exempt
property.
the
way
florida
defines
the
exemption,
it
is
exempt
property
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
not
covered
by
the
preexisting
lien.
it
is
not
exempt
to
the
extent
that
it's
covered
by
the
preexisting
lien.
what
congress
did
in
522
was
to--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--right.
and
just
as
the...
florida
could
have
decided
to,
instead
of
having
a
half-acre
exemption,
it
could
have
a
quarter-acre
exemption,
or
an
eighth-of-an-acre
exemption.
it
has
decided
to
define
this
in
terms
of
property
which
is
subject
to
preexisting
lien
and
property
which
isn't.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
in
many
cases
it,
the
amount
of
the
lien
will
be
less
than
the
total
amount
of
the
property,
just
apparently
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
the
case
here.
what--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--there
are
two
kinds
of
property.
in
this
particular
case
it
is
probable
that
the
lien
was
greater
than
the
amount
of
the
property.
so,
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
there
wasn't
any
property
which
would
qualify
for
the
exemption
here,
because
it
was
all
subject
to
a
lien.
in
most
situations
the
property
probably
would
be
greater
in
value
than
the
amount
of
the
lien,
but
that
didn't
happen
to
be
the
case
here.
and
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
the
petitioner
has
suggested
that
522(f)
is
meaningless
if
our
construction
is
adopted.
what
congress
was
concerned
about
here
was
several
things.
first
of
all,
it
was
concerned
with
the
rule
of
long
against
bullard,
this
ancient
supreme
court
case
which
said
that
even
if
there
is
an
exemption,
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
apparently,
that
the
lien
is
going
to
be
preserved.
and
congress,
when
it
enacted
522,
decided
to
adopt
the
rule
of
long
v.
bullard
as
a
general
matter,
and
you
see
that
in
522(c),
and
to
preserve
most
liens.
in
particular
it
decided
to
preserve
purchase
money
mortgages
and
liens,
but
to
carve
out
an
exception
from
the
rule
of
long
against
bullard
in
the
case
of
these
judicial
liens
and
nonpurchase
money,
nonpossessory
liens.
and
what
it
was
doing
in
that
respect
was
trying
to
serve
state
policy
in
those
states
that
had
opted
out
of
the
federal
exemptions
to,
where
a
state
did
not
define
the
property
in
the
limited
way
that
florida
did
here,
it,
congress
decided
to
assist
state
policy
by
voiding
the
lien.
and
522(f),
of
course,
had
other
purposes
also,
because
there
is
the
alternative
list
of
federal
bankruptcy
exemptions.
522(f)
operates
with
respect
to
that.
there
are
federal
nonbankruptcy
exemptions.
it
operates
with
respect
to
that.
and
there
are
liens
created
by
states
outside
of
the
debtor's
domiciliary
state,
and
522(f)
operates
with
respect
to
those
also.
so
it's
a
meaningful
provision
in
all
of
these
respects,
if
you
would
opt
our
interpretation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no.
no,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
what
the
would
is
referring
to.
i
think
it
does
not
mean
would
have
been
entitled
if
florida
had
been
more
generous
in
defining
its
exemptions.
that
is
not
what
the
would
means.
would
have
been
entitled
means
would
have
been
entitled,
except
for
the
rule
of
long
against
bullard,
in
other
words
this
federal
lien
preservation
policy.
so
that's,
that's
what
the
meaning
of
the
word
would
is
in
there.
and
as
far
as
justice
scalia's
question
about
fixing,
the
use
of
the
word
fixing,
i
don't
attribute
any
significance
to
that
either.
a
lot
of
people
puzzled
about
that.
it
can't
mean
prospectively,
because
the
automatic
stay
provision
in
section
362
of
the
code
would
prevent
the
fixing
of
the
judicial
lien
after
the
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition.
so
it
has
to
be
referring
to
past--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think,
i
think
what...
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether,
for
example,
a
state
would
have
the
power
to
allow
people
to
waive
exemptions.
the
answer
to...
and
that
is
dealt
with
in
the
clause
that
you
read
and
also
in
section
522(e)--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--which
also
talks
about
waivers.
i
think
that's
a
rather
different
question
than
we
have
in
this
case,
and
a
somewhat
difficult
one
in
view
of
some
of
the
past
supreme
court
cases
dealing
with
the
issue
of
waiver.
but
that's
a,
a
separate
question
which
the
court
may
have
to
save
for
some
other
day.
but
in
terms
of
the
ability
of
the
state
to
define
property,
that's
what
the
controversy
was
all
about
between
the
house
and
the
senate
in
enacting
section
522.
and
the
senate
essentially
won
out
and
the
states
were
given
the
right
to
define
what
is
property
for
purposes
of
the
exemption,
what
the
exemption
should
be,
and
the
effort
to
federalize
the
exemptions
essentially
failed.
florida
has
the
right
to
define
the
exemption.
it
has
opted
out
of
the
federal
exemption
scheme.
and
so
it
has
defined
the
exemption
not
to
include
property
to
the
extent
of
the
lien,
there
is
nothing
on,
which
522
can
offer
it.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
justice
stevens.
let's
suppose,
for
example,
the
state
had
created
a
$400
exemption
for
personal
property,
and
the
consequence
there
is
that
an
individual
comes
into
bankruptcy
and
he
decides,
he
designates
which
$400
worth
of
property
he
would
like
to
exempt.
now
under
state
law,
some
of
that
property
may
come
into
bankruptcy
subject
to
liens.
522(f)
says,
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
state
has
a
$400
exemption
you
are
going
to
avoid
the
judicial
liens
and
nonpossessory,
nonpurchase
money
liens
in
that
property.
that
is
not
a
situation
in
which
a
state
has
made
a
choice,
such
as
florida's,
to
preserve
the
lien.
it
has
just
been
silent
about
it.
and
that
is
fairly
frequent.
the
second
part
of
our
argument,
of
course,
relates
to
this
interesting
question
of
retroactivity,
which
has
occupied
this
court
in
a
number
of
occasions
over
the
last
several
years.
and
what
we
suggest
is
there's
an
alternative
ground,
if
you
need
to
reach
it,
to
affirm
the
judgment
below,
and
that
is
that
federal
law
should
not
be
construed
to
require
the
retroactive
application
of
state
law.
state
law
here
is
very
clear
that
when
there
is
a
new
exemption
created,
as
there
was
here
for
single
people,
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
preexisting
liens.
so
under
florida
there's
a
rule
against
retroactivity
of
these
exemptions.
in
the
security
industrial
bank
case,
of
course,
this
court
determined
that
federal
law
522(f)
should
not
be
construed
to
operate
retroactively.
we
have
suggested...
and
under
the
kener
case,
justice
holmes'
opinion
in
the
kener
case,
that
federal
law
should
not
be
construed
as
requiring
that
state
law
operate
retroactively.
and
that
is
essentially
for
the
same
reasons
as
this
court
articulated
in
holt
and
security
industrial
bank,
and
articulated
most
clearly
in
the
kener
case.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
don't,
i
don't
think
it,
it
really
does,
justice
o'connor.
the
fresh
start
policy
is
not
a
policy
that
the
debtor
carry
all
his
property
through
bankruptcy.
it's
a,
it's
a
policy
that
he
have
a
certain
amount
of
property
to
begin
again.
and
the
states
are
to
define
what
that
property
is,
and
some
states
are
very
generous,
the
way
florida
is,
and
some
states
are
not
so
generous.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
522
that
congress
was
somehow
dissatisfied
with
florida's
generosity
and
felt
that
something
more
was
required.
if
they
hadn't
done
that
they
would
have
enacted
the
mandatory
federal
exemptions
that
were
proposed,
and
they
would
have
increased,
vastly
increased
the
amount
of
those
exemptions.
florida
is
giving
people
much
more
than
the
$7,500
federal
exemption
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
is
no
personal
liability
of
the
debtor
here.
the
sole
question
is
whether
the
property
is
going
to
pass
through
bankruptcy
with
the
lien
intact
or
without
the
lien
intact.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
there's
another
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
506,
which
deals
with
this,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
and
under
506(d),
if
the
lien
exceeds
the
value
of
the
property
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy,
that
that
excess
amount
of
the
lien
is
voided
as
a
result
of
passing
through
bankruptcy.
so
if
we
had
a
situation
here
where
the
property
is
worth
$135,000
and
the
lien
is
$158,000,
as
a
result
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
the
lien
is
reduced
to
$135,000.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
the
amount
of
the
lien
has
been
ascertained
at
$158,000.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
determination
of
the
value.
the
value
was
listed
at
$135,000,
and
i
don't
recall
that
there
was
any
dispute
about
that.
