justice
scalia
mr.
fishell,
do
you,
do
you
give
any
weight
to
the
fact
that
522(f)
does
not
say
notwithstanding
any
waiver
or
exemption
that
the
debtor
may
avoid
a
lien
on
the
interest
of
the
debtor?
it
says
the
debtor
may
avoid
the
fixing
of
a
lien.
is,
is
that
at
all
a
suggestion
that
it's
only
talking
about,
it
is
not
referring
to
liens
that
have
attached
earlier,
before
the
bankruptcy
proceeding?
justice
scalia
yes,
i
think...
i
think
i,
i
think
i...
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
but
i
don't
under...
i
don't
understand
why
the,
why
the
statute
is
phrased
the
way
it
is.
one
would
have
thought
they
would
have
just
said
the
debtor
may
avoid
a
lien
on
the
interest
of
the
debtor,
but
it
doesn't.
it
says,
may
avoid
the
fixing
of
a
lien.
it's
sort
of
a
strange
phrase.
maybe
it
means
nothing,
which
is
essentially
what
you
say,
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
justice
scalia
um
hum.
justice
scalia
what
did
they
have
in
mind?
do
you
have
any
other
meaning
for
the
fixing
of...
or
are
you
just...
i
mean,
maybe
it
doesn't
have
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
presents
a
problem
concerning
the
interaction
of
two
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
one
of
which
allows
individuals
to
exempt
property
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
and
one
of
which
permits
them
to
avoid
judicial
liens
on
that
exempt
property.
the
problem
is
raised
because
the
code
permits
the
states
to
define
what
exemptions
their
citizens
may
take
and
does
not
limit
the
state's
power
to
define
these
exemptions.
thus,
the
question
presents
itself
whether
a
state
may
define
its
exemptions
so
as
to
exclude
from
those
exemptions
property
encumbered
by
a
judicial
lien
thereby,
in
effect,
nullifying
the
federal
lien
avoidance
power
for
those
state-created
exemptions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
state's
excepting
from
its
exemptions
property
encumbered
by
a
judicial
lien
will
not
affect
the
operation
of
the
federal
lien
avoidance
power.
the
code
gives
the
bankruptcy
court
the
power
to
avoid
a
lien
to
the
extent
that
such
lien
impairs
an
exemption
to
which
the
debtor
would
have
been
entitled,
and
that
is
the
crucial
language,
would
have
been
entitled
under
the
section
defining
the
exemptions.
to
make
sense
of
the
term
"would
have
been
entitled",
we
must
ask
would
have
been
entitled
but
for
what?
in
applying
the
same
statutory
provision
to
federal
exemptions,
bankruptcy
courts
have
uniformly
asked
whether
the
lien
impairs
an
exemption
to
which
the
debtor
would
have
been
entitled
but
for
that
lien.
that
is
they
determined
first
what
exemption
the
debtor
would
have
been
entitled
to
without
the
lien
at
question,
and
then
determine
whether
the
lien
impairs
that
exemption.
we
see
no
reason
to
read
the
statute
differently
in
the
context
of
state
exemptions.
thereto,
the
court
should
ask
what
exemption
the
debtor
would
enjoy
but
for
the
lien
in
question,
and
then
determine
whether
the
lien
impairs
that
exemption.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
though
otherwise
and
its
judgment
is
therefore,
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent.
