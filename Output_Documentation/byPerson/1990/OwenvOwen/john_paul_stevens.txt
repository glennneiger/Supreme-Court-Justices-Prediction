justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
another
question
just
referring
to
the
language
of
522(f).
the
avoidances
of
the
lien
or
the
fixing
of
the
lien,
to
the
extent
that
such
lien
impairs
an
exemption
to
which
the
debtor
would
have
been
entitled
under
subsection
(b).
now
as
i
understand
it,
in
this
case
the
property
was
exempt
from
the
claims
of
general
creditors
under
subsection
(b),
which
was,
isn't...
didn't
it
in
effect
keep
the
property
out
of
the
estate
for
administration
of
bankruptcy
purposes?
justice
stevens
so
that
there
was
no
impairment
of
the
exemption.
even
if
the
lien
survived
and
the
only
remedy
of
the
creditors,
the
secured
creditors'
only
remedy
is
a,
perhaps
a
state
lawsuit
or
a
postbankruptcy
enforcement
of
the
lien,
but
the
property
was,
you
retain
the
entire
exemption
from
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
that's--
justice
stevens
--i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
it
did
hold,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
property
was
exempt
from,
it
didn't
have
to
be
listed,
or
whatever
you
do,
as
an
asset
of
the
estate.
justice
stevens
which
is,
it
seems
to
me...
that's
the
complete
exemption
to
which
you
are
entitled
if
the
property
was
exempt.
it
was
exempt
from
the
claims
of
general
creditors
and
it
couldn't
be
charged
for
the
costs
of
administration
or
anything
like
that.
so
it
seems
to
me
under
the
language
of
it,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you,
how
you
can
say
that
the
lien
impaired
the
exemption.
you
got
the
exemption.
justice
stevens
right.
but
that's
independently
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
the
property
is
exempt
from
any
bankruptcy
remedy.
justice
stevens
maybe
i,
maybe
i
missed
something
in
that
language.
justice
stevens
but
not
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
justice
stevens
yes,
but,
let
me
just
stop
you,
if
i
may.
if
the
property
worth
more...
had
been,
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
are,
worth
more
than
the
amount
of
your
client's
claim,
so
that
theoretically
there
would
be
a
portion
available
to
the
claims
of
general
creditors,
at
least
it
is
established
that
the
property
was
that,
to
that
extent
exempt.
justice
stevens
so
then
if
it's,
if
it's
at
least
in
the
category
of
exempt
property,
why,
how
do
you
get
around
the
language
of
522(f)
that
the
only
thing
that,
about
the
exemption
that
wasn't
impaired
is
the
lien,
to
the
extent
that
such
lien
impairs
an
exemption,
to
which--
justice
stevens
--in
other
words,
the
condominium
is
treated
as
though
it
were
two
separate
parcels.
one
parcel
is
exempt,
that
is
the
part
that
the
general
creditors
are
trying
to
reach,
and
the
other
parcel
is
nonexempt.
justice
stevens
the
problem
i
have
with
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute
refers
to
an
interest
of
the
debtor
in
property
to
the
extent
that
such
lien
impairs
an
exemption,
and
so
forth,
which
seems
to
me
to
assume
for
purposes
of
that
language
that
the
amount
of
the
lien
is
less
than
the
total
value
of
the
property.
justice
stevens
it
talks
about
to
the
extent
of
the
impairment.
justice
stevens
could
you,
i
know
you
did
it
already
and
i
just
didn't
follow
part
of
your
discussion,
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
the
avoidance
of
a
judicial
lien
to
which
this
language
applies?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
and
along
the
same
line?
i
gather
under
the
fresh
start
policy
your
client's
claim
against
your
opponent
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeded
the
value
of
this
property
has
been
discharged?
it
was
not
a
nondischargeable
debt?
justice
stevens
and
if
the
lien
attaches,
if
the
lien
survives
and
the
value
of
the
property
fluctuates,
how
do,
how
do
we
know
the
value
of
the
lien
when
the
debt
has
been
discharged?
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
maybe
i'm
just
stupid
about
this,
but
i--
justice
stevens
--now
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
over,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
so
has
that,
has
the
amount
of
the,
the
value
of
the
lien
been
ascertained?
justice
stevens
i
see.
okay,
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
dyk.
mr.
fishell,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
