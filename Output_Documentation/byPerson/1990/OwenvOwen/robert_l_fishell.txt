mr.
robert
l.
fishell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
the--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--the
scope
and
effect
of
section
522(f)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
lien
avoidance
provision.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the,
is
the
scope
and
effect
of
522(f)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
lien
avoidance
provision.
now,
the...
that
provision
allows
for
the
avoidance
of
certain
liens
on
exempt
property
that
a
debtor
may
retain
through
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
debtor
sought
to
exempt
homestead
property
in
florida
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
his
bankruptcy
petition.
under
florida
law,
however,
the
property
was
not
immune
by
reason
of
the
exemption
to
the
attachment
of
a
lien
which
they
attached
to
the
property
prior
to
the
time
that
the
exemption
was
obtained.
now
each
of
the
cases,
each
of
the
decisions
below,
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
essentially
that
the
lien
was
not
avoidable
because
the
property
was
not
exempt
in
the
sense
that
the
lien,
having
attached
prior
to
the
time
of
the
exemption
right,
rendered
the
property
an
exception
to
the
homestead
exemption.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
that
is
florida
law.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
that's
purely
an
expression
of
the
way
florida
law
treated
it.
as
you
will
note
in
the
bankruptcy
court
decision,
the
critical
part
of
the
holding
there
asserts
or
states
virtually
the
precise
application
of
florida
law
without
any
effect
being
given
to
522(f).
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
specifically
stated
that,
that
the
property
was
specifically
subject
to
this
exception,
meaning
a
lien
attaching
prior
to
the
right
of
the
homestead
remained
subject
to
that
lien
and
could
be
enforced
despite
the
later
acquisition
in
the
homestead
right.
now
that
leads
us
to
the
central
issue
involved
in
this
case.
if,
whether
or
not
it
is
permissible
for
state
law
to
define
as
an
exception
to
the
exemption
a
property
encumbered
by
the
lien.
in
other
words,
the
only
reason
the
property
is
defeated
as
to
the
exemption
is
by
virtue
of
the
attachment
of
the
lien.
now
the
lien
is--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--i
see
nothing
wrong,
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
conclusion.
in
other
words,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be
impermissible
for
a
state
to
determine
that
it
was
not
going
to
allow
the
homestead
exemption,
period.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
absolutely.
it
wouldn't
come
into
play
at
all,
because
there
would
be
no
exemption
upon
which
this
particular
judicial
lien
had
attached.
consequently
the
lien
avoidance
would
not
come
into
play,
and
this
case
would
not
be
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
florida
law
provides
for
the
homestead
exemption.
on
the
date
that
this
debtor
filed
his
petition
he
was
entitled
to
assert
that
exemption.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
well--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--the
lien...
yes,
your
honor.
the
lien
remains
enforceable
as
to
a
preexisting
judicial
lien
under
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
but
only
to
that
extent
was
it
not
exempt,
only
as
to
this
particular
creditor.
the
attachment
of
a
lien
does
not
have
the
effect
of
rendering
the
homestead
exemption
unavailable
for
all
purposes
to
a
debtor
who
later
qualifies
for
the
homestead,
even
if
the
property
already
has
a
lien
attached.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
well--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--i
think
they
could.
i
am
not,
i
am
not
suggesting--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
florida--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
florida
statute
regarding...
or
the
florida
decision
law
regarding
homestead
exemptions
is
in
any
sense
invalid.
the
issue
here
is
really
whether
or
not
this
is
going
to
survive
through
the
lien
avoidance
mechanism
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
florida
deciding
that
they
are
not
going
to
allow
an
exemption
for
a
particular
creditor,
and
that
is
all
this
is.
they
are
not
going
to
allow
an
exemption
for
a
particular
creditor
to
be...
to
deny
that
creditor
a
right
against
the
property.
but
at
the
same
time
that
doesn't
prevent
the...
the
homesteader
from
achieving
homestead
status
for
the
property,
which
he
could
protect
against
the
wide
world,
other
than
this
creditor.
florida
is
perfectly,
it
is
perfectly
all
right
for
them
to
allow
such
a
protection
for
a
given
creditor.
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
question,
though.
the
issue
then
becomes
what
is
the
effect
of
522(f)
once
the
bankruptcy
petition
is
filed?
now
when
we
focus
on
that
we
note
that
this
is
a
judicial
lien,
it
has
not
been
challenged,
it
is
being
anything
other
than
that.
on
the
date
that
the
debtor
filed
his
petition
he
was
entitled
to
the
exemption
generally
under
florida
law.
the
bankruptcy
court
acknowledged
this.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
under
state--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--under
state
law,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
the
real
problem
here
is
if
this
state
law
rule
carries
over
into
bankruptcy,
then
we
have
destroyed
any
effectiveness
of
the
lien
avoidance
provision
in
bankruptcy.
because
if
it
were
permissible
for
florida
to
say
by
decision
law,
which
it
has,
that
this
particular
lien
is
going
to
be
enforceable
despite
the
later
acquisition
of
the
homestead
right,
then
that
situation
carried
over
into
bankruptcy
is
going
to
defeat
the
effectiveness
of
522(f).
the
only--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--well,
your
honor,
they
did
in
a
sense,
congress
did
in
a
sense
allow
states
to
opt
out.
but
the
opt
out
is
essentially
limited
to
the
types
and
quantities
of
property
that
may
be
exempted
in
bankruptcy.
they
allow
states
to
choose
their
own.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
florida
has
done
so,
but
florida...
the
florida
statute,
which
in
effect
opts
florida
out
of
the
bank,
of
the
federal
exemptions,
makes
no
reference
to
attempting
to
opt
out
of
the
lien
avoidance
provision
of
522(f).
it
is
silent
on
that.
you
don't--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
so
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
we
have
florida...
florida
hasn't
made
any
attempt
to
evade
or
opt
out
of
the
lien
avoidance
provision.
it
has
only
opted
out
of
the
list
of
quantities
and
types
of
property
on
which
an
exemption
may
be
enjoyed.
now,
if,
if
we
have,
as
we
do
here,
a
situation
where
the
exception
to
the
exemption,
which
is
in
this
case
the
lien
encumbered...
the
lien,
the
encumbrance,
if
that
is
an
exception
to
the
exemption,
then
it
no
longer
is
the
impairment
of
the
exemption,
was
in
the
application
of
522(f).
if
it
disappears
as
an
impairment,
then
the,
the
concept
of
impairment
disappears.
the
exception
takes
it
out
of,
out
of
the
realm
of
property
upon
which
the
lien
avoidance
could
be
applied.
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
that
a
state
would
be
entitled
to
define
its
exemptions
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
defeat
the
operation
of
another
section
of
the
code.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--some
state
statutes
have,
have
defined
their
exemption
laws
in
such
a
way
that
certain,
certain
acts
or
agreements
undertaken
between
the
creditor
and
the
debtor
have
the
effect
of
waiving
an
exemption
or
waiving
a
protection
in
bankruptcy
that
might
be,
that
might
be,
might
have
been
accorded
the
debtor
in
the
particular
property.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
no,
your
honor,
i
don't...
522(f)
i
think
is
broad
enough
to
cover
any
kind
of
exemption
that--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--well,
in
other
words,
even
a
voluntary
relinquishment
of
a
protection
that
the
debtor
might
have
under
state
law
wouldn't
preclude
him
from
asserting
his
exemption
rights
once
bankruptcy
is
filed
and
lien
avoidance
is
sought.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
that--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--well,
i
think
that
is
significant
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
that
there
must
be
some
reason
for
the
lien
avoidance
remedy
that
congress
enacted.
that
is
probably
a
recognition
that
there
are
reasons,
liens
arising
under
state
law
which
would
impair
exemptions...
there
might,
there
would
be
some
reason
why
the
state
law
would
have
the
effect
of
denying
a
debtor
the
right
to
use
the
exemption
and
protect
his
exemption
through
bankruptcy,
and
thus
deny
him
the
full
benefit
and
meaning
of
his
fresh
start.
i
think
the...
i
think
both
the
senate
and
house
versions
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
indicate
that
the
lien
was,
the
lien
could
be
avoided,
and
that
it
was
intended
to
operate
where
the
debtor
could
have
enjoyed
an
exemption
in
the
absence
of
the
lien.
it
was
a
recognition
that
a
lien
normally
or
otherwise
unaffected
by
the
bankruptcy
discharge
would
pass
through
and
remain
attached
to
the
exempt
property,
and
it
would
frustrate
the
debtor's
fresh
start.
it
was,
i
believe
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
there
was
essentially
no
remedy
for
avoidance
of
liens
that
attached
to
property
prior
to
bankruptcy.
in
other
words,
the
bankruptcy
discharge
had
no
effect
on
liens.
they
passed
through,
the
creditor
was
free
to
assert
his
rights
as
a
secured
creditor
following
bankruptcy,
and
the
fresh
start
was
less
than
fresh.
i
think
that
is,
i
think
if,
if
we
permit,
if
we
permit
or
fail
to
independently
apply
the
lien
avoidance
provision
to
the
state
exemption
definitions,
that
we
will
run
the
risk
of
having
the
result
that
we
have
here.
the
state
specifically
excepts
from
its
exemption
as
to
this
creditor
a
lien
attaching...
if
lien
avoidance
is
not
independently
applied
to
the
state
exemption
scheme,
then
the
exception
to
the
exemption,
as
noted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
they
concluded
it
was
an
exception
to
the
exemption,
if
the
lien
is
the
exception
to
the
exemption,
then
it
is
taken
out
of
the
application
of
lien
avoidance,
because
the
exception
makes
it
impossible
to
assert
the
exemption.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
no,
your
honor,
i
don't,
i
don't
think
that
that...
i
don't
think
that
that
refers
to
a
situation
where
a
lien...
if
it,
if
it
is
in
essence
a
prospective
fixing
of
the
lien,
this
may
in
many
ways
be
an
unrealistic
view
in
the
sense
that
if
a
debt
is
discharged
it
may
not
constitute
a
lien
postpetition.
in
other
words,
i
am
sure
that
the
lien
attaches
at
some
point.
if
it
attaches
prepetition,
then
it
can
constitute
an
impairment
to
the
exemption.
does
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
well,
i
don't...
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
i
don't,
i
don't
think
that
it
had
to
have
referred
to
a
situation
where
the
congress
contemplated
the
fixing
of
a
lien
at
some
time
postpetition.
in
other
words,
522(f)
wouldn't
apply
until--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--a
bankruptcy
petition
is
filed.
and
if
it
was
only
prospective
in
its
application,
i
don't
think
that's,
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
well,
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
cannot...
i
don't
think
it's
a
situation
where
it
could
not
be
read
to
apply
to
liens
attaching
prior
to
bankruptcy.
i
don't
see
the
significance
of
reading
it
in
such
a
limited
fashion.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
that's,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
your
honor,
the
bankruptcy
court
decision
on
that
issue
specifically
did
not
determine--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--this
particular
creditor's
rights
with
respect
to
the
property.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
that's,
that's
correct.
it
allowed
it
as
a
general
exemption--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--well,
the
impairment
exists
because
under
state
law
this
property
remains
subject
to
this
particular
creditor's
lien.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
well--
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
--the
lien
avoidance
provision
is
specifically
designed
to
avoid
liens
that
impair
exemptions.
now
the
bankruptcy
court
determined
that
the
debtor
was
entitled
to
this
exemption,
this
lien
remains
enforceable
under
nonbankruptcy
law
following
discharge
unless
this
lien
is
avoided.
522(f)
gives
that
relief.
it,
the
lien
is...
or,
the
exemption
is
impaired
because
the
property
remains
subject
to
the
lien,
and
the
lien
is
enforceable.
therefore,
if
the
lien
is
not
avoidable
under
522(f),
the
creditor
executes
on
the
property
and
the
debtor
has
lost
his
homestead.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
no,
sir.
the...
if
the
lien
is,
if
for
some
reason
the
lien
were
not
avoided,
the
creditor
would
be
able
to
proceed
in
state
court
and
execute
on
the
property.
but
the
lien
avoidance
is
a
federal
bankruptcy
remedy
to
preserve
exemptions.
under
the...
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
these
sections
of
the
code,
and
as
early
as
the
commission
on
bankruptcy
laws
in
1973,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
concern
about,
about
property,
exempt
property,
if
you
will,
being
lost
following
bankruptcy
because
liens
were
not
avoided,
exemptions
of
themselves
didn't
have
the
effect
of
insulating
the
property
from,
from
preexisting
liens.
there
was
no
lien
avoidance
remedy
prior
to
the
code.
i
think
the
lien
avoidance
was
a
specific
federal
remedy
designed
to
enhance
the
debtor's
fresh
start,
and
to
assure
that
the
property,
if
it
was
exempt
and
for
some
reason
remains
subject
to
a
lien,
a
lien
could
be
avoided.
now,
the
lien
avoidance
remedy
applies
to
only
very
specific
kinds
of
liens,
(f)(1)
and
(f)(2).
the
(f)(1)
is
the
nonconsensual
judicial
lien.
(f)(2)
is
a
more
limited
remedy.
i
think,
i
think
that
if
this
court
does
not
recognize
that
this
lien
is
impaired,
or
this
exemption
is
not
impaired,
it
is
only
not
impaired
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
concluded
that
there
is
an
exception
for
lien
encumbered
property.
if
it
is
lien
encumbered
property
that
falls
within
the
confines
of
(f)(1),
where,
where
will
(f)(1)
apply
if
state
law
or
state
legislatures
can
create
exceptions
to
the
exemption
schemes
which
include
definitions
that
take
the
property
out
of
the
operation
of
522(f).
(f)
would
be
rendered
a
useless
and
meaningless
remedy
if
the
definitions
could
include
exceptions
for
lien
encumbrances.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
fishell
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
generosity
or
lack
thereof
the
state
chooses
to
give
is
up
to
the
state,
and
the
bankruptcy
code
leaves,
leaves
that
as
it
is.
but
the
lien
avoidance
remedy
is
something
that
is
federally
created.
if
you...
both
the
senate
and
the
house
versions
of
the
legislative
history
make
it
apparent
that
a
lien
was
to
avoided
to
the
extent
that
an
exemption
could
be
enjoyed
in
the
absence
of
the
lien.
i,
the--
if
this,
if
this,
if
this
debtor's
property
is
executed
on,
he
will
be
deprived
of
his
exemption
by
a
lone
creditor.
this
will
not
serve
to
benefit
the
general
administration
of
his
estate.
it
will
not
serve
to
benefit
the
larger
share
of
his,
of
his
creditors.
this
would
not
in,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
pardon
me...
succeed
in
giving
this
debtor
a
fresh
start.
this
was
a
no
asset
case.
his
lone
asset
is
the
homestead.
florida
law
gives
him
the
homestead.
this
lien
is
the
only,
the
only
thing
that
takes
that
exemption
away.
this
lien
is
precisely
within
the
definition
of
the
terms
and
the
conditions
of
522(f)(1),
and
needs
to
be
avoided.
if
you
permit
state
exceptions
for
lien
encumbered
property
to
defeat
522(f),
then
we
will
return
to
precode
days
where
all
liens
passed
through
bankruptcy
unavoided.
and
the
credi...
and
the
debtor
has
no
remedy,
has
no
means
of
securing
the
exemption
to
himself
following
his
discharge.
that's
the
reason
that
i
believe
that,
that
if
this
court
takes
an
independent
application
of
522(f)
upon
whatever
categories,
quantities,
or
types
of
property
that
a
state
has
included
within
its
list
of
exemptions,
and
makes
an
independent
application
of
the
lien
avoidance
provision
above
and
beyond
the
list
selected
by
the
state,
then
the
lien
must
be
avoided.
if
it
is
not,
then
the
exemption
definitions
created
by
the
state
will
allow
states
to
evade
the
lien
avoidance
concept
or
remedy
altogether.
thank
you,
your
honor.
