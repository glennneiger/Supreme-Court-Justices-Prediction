justice
kennedy
do
you
give
any
significance
to
the
introductory
clause
of
522(f),
notwithstanding
any
waiver
of
exemptions?
that
is
really
not
necessary
under
your
view,
is
it,
under
the
way
you
read
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
or
is
it?
am
i
wrong?
justice
kennedy
those
aren't
taken
care
of
by
522(e)?
justice
kennedy
but
is
it
needed
in
light
of
522(e),
under
your
view,
under
your
interpretation?
i
don't,
i
don't
see
what
force
and
effect
it
has.
it's
a
transition
from
the
previous
section.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
not,
not
under
your
view,
because
you
say
there
are
really
two
kinds
of
property.
justice
kennedy
is
the
first
phrase,
notwithstanding
any
exemption
of...
any
waiver
of
exemptions,
necessary
just
for
absolute
clarity?
justice
kennedy
(e),
yes.
