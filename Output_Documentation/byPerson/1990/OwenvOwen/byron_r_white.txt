justice
white
you
can...
crank
up
that,
and
maybe
you'll...
the
other
way.
you
may
be
closer
to
the
microphone.
justice
white
well,
that
florida
law...
florida
law
at
the
time
this
bankruptcy
was
filed
provided
that
this
homestead
was
not
exempt.
it
provided
that
it
was
subject
to
a
lien.
so
you
can't
say
that
it
was
just
totally
exempt.
justice
white
wasn't
that
true
under
florida
law?
that
lien
was
enforceable
despite
the
homestead
exception?
justice
white
well,
to
that
extent
the...
this
property
was
not
exempt.
justice
white
you
think,
then,
you
think
a
state
couldn't
say,
well,
we
grant
a
homestead
exemption,
but,
except
that
all
mechanics
liens
will
be
good
against
the
homestead?
justice
white
yes
or
no?
justice
white
so
they
could
say,
they
could
say
sure,
we
have
a
homestead
exemption
that
is
good
against
all
liens
except
mechanics
liens?
justice
white
and
then
how
about
in
bankruptcy
then?
justice
white
well,
i
think...
why
didn't
congress
intend
that
by
permitting
a
state
to
opt
out
of
the
federal
scheme
and
specify
its
own
exemptions?
justice
white
you
would
think
they
would
have
contemplated
that
the
state
could
quali...
could
define
the
exemptions
they
were
granting
in
any
way
they
wanted
to.
justice
white
i
guess
that
is
why
the
case
is
here.
justice
white
wasn't
there
a,
didn't
the
bankruptcy
court
decide
that
there
wasn't
a
exemption?
i
suppose
when
you
file
here
you
have
to
file
the
schedule
of
your
property
and
you
have
to
make
a
specific
claim
about,
that
some
property
is
exempt.
justice
white
yes,
yes,
yes.
and
didn't
your
client
object
to
this
claim?
justice
white
and
the
bankruptcy
court
rejected
that.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
you
objected
to
it,
but
you
didn't
win.
justice
white
well,
that's
right,
but
that's...
i
know
the
lien
avoidance
was
not
at
issue
at
that
time.
justice
white
well,
he
didn't
decide
it,
anyway.
justice
white
he
said
that,
he
said
that
this
property
was
exempt
under
florida
law
in
this
bankruptcy
proceeding
from
the
claims
of
general
creditors,
and
was
not
subject
to
the
general
administration
of
the
trustee.
justice
white
we
didn't
appeal
that
order,
i
guess?
justice
white
well,
literally
he
cited
against
you
by
saying
that
there
was
an
exemption.
you
say
there
wasn't
an
exemption.
justice
white
i
know,
but...
you,
you,
just
a
while
ago
you
said
that,
you
said
that
this
property
just
wasn't
exempt.
justice
white
there
wasn't
anything
for
522(f)
to
operate
on.
justice
white
right
on,
right
on
the
schedule?
justice
white
by
your
client?
