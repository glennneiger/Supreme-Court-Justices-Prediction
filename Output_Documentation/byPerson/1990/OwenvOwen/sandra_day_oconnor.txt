justice
o'connor
i
can't
hear
you.
could
you
speak
up,
please?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
fishell,
could,
could
a
state
decide
that
it
wasn't
going
to
allow
an
exemption
at
all
for
homesteads?
justice
o'connor
and
if
it
did
that,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
relief
available
under
522(f)?
justice
o'connor
how
critical
is
the
language
in
the
statute
522(f)
that
refers
to
an
exemption
to
which
the
debtor
would
have
been
entitled?
justice
o'connor
mr.
dyk,
to
prevail,
do
you
have
to
read
the,
the
522(f)
language
would
have
been
entitled
as
is
entitled?
justice
o'connor
thank
you,
mr.--
--well,
one
question,
if
i
may.
excuse
me.
your
interpretation
does
rather
cut
against
the
fresh
start
policy,
i
suppose?
