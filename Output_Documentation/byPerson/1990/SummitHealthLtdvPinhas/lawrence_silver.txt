mr.
lawrence
silver
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
in
its
interprets...
in
the
interpretation
of
mclain.
we
have
the
ninth
in
western
waste,
the
third
in
cardio-medical
associations,
the
fifth
which
no
one
cited
in
their
briefs,
parks,
el
paso
board
of
realtors
and
the
eleventh
circuit
in
shahawy
all
deciding
that
under
the
clear
language
of
mclain
that
justice
scalia
and
justice
stevens
referred
to
provided
a
general
business
activities'
test.
the
remaining
numbered
circuits
except
for
the
fourth
which
has
thus
far
avoided
a
determination
of
the
issue
have
determined
that
the
mclain
reading
is
much
more
narrow
and
implies
an
affected
activities'
test.
what
this...
this
case
is
controlled
by
mclain.
but
i
think
we
have
to
take
one
step
back
if
we
can
to
the
rex
hospital
case.
no
one
calls
it
the
hospital
building
case,
but
the
rex
hospital
case
which
came
before
it,
that's
a
plaintiff's
case.
mclain
is
a
defendant's
case
and
the
pinhas
case
is
a
plaintiff/defendant's
case
and
allow
me
to
explain,
if
i
may.
in
rex
hospital
a
hospital
sued
for
anti-trust
violations
against
another
hospital.
it
asserted
that
the
second
defendant
hospital
interfered
with
its
activities
to
expand
its
interstate
commerce.
the
amicus
in
that
case
represented
by
weissburg
and
aronson
asserted
quite
compellingly
in
this
court
in
the
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
justice
marshall
determined
that
the
plaintiff's
purchase
of
medicines,
that
the
plaintiff's
receipt
of
money
from
medicare
and
medicaid
from
the
federal
government,
that
the
plaintiff's
receipt
of
supplies
from
out-of-state
sellers,
that
the
plaintiff's
insurance
receipts
from
out-of-state
insurance
companies,
and
the
plaintiff's
treatment
of
patients
from
out
of
state
was
sufficient
basis
in
interstate
commerce
to
justify
jurisdiction.
we
then
come
to
mclain,
the
next
case
that
the
court
deals
with.
although
goldfarb
is
in
the
middle,
goldfarb
is
an
in
commerce.
it
didn't
have
to
be
i
don't
think,
but
the
plaintiff's
alleged
an
in
commerce.
so
goldfarb
is
a
problem
in
terms
of...
in
fact
the
lower
court
judge
in
mclain
misunderstood
that.
in
goldfarb
they
alleged
in
commerce
rather
than
affecting
commerce.
in
mclain,
you
had
a
defendant's
case.
plaintiff's...
financial
people
who
wanted
to
sell
their
houses.
everywhere
they
went
there
was
a
uniform
6
percent
i
think,
rule
for
commissions.
plaintiffs
had
no
interstate
commerce.
they
just
wanted
to
sell
their
house.
they
had
to
rely
for
jurisdiction
on
the
defendant's
activities
and
only
the
defendant's
activities.
if
it
was
the
defendant's
activities
that
were
not
involved,
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
this
court
found
jurisdiction
and
in
so
finding,
it
found
that
and
looked
at
two
things.
one,
the
plaintiff
need
to
show
a...
interfered
with
activity
as
well
as
demonstrated
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
generated
by
the
brokerage
activities.
in
western
waste,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
first
circuit
to
interpret
mclain,
said
that
these
activities
could
be
independent
of
the
violations
in
western
waste.
the
tenth
circuit
filed
a
decision
much
later
that's
different
in
some
respects.
but
what
the
court...
there
is
a
claim
by
the
way
in
the
commentators,
apparently...
i
think
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
opinion
in
mclain.
i
think
that
mclain
clearly
holds
that
if
you
show
those
two
things,
you
have
jurisdiction.
you
may
have
an
offense
in
some
other
portion.
you
may
have
your
case
in
some
other
portion.
in
indeed,
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment,
depart
in
answer,
if
i
may,
i
think
justice
stevens'
question.
if
you
had
those
2
weeks
of
unaffected
violations,
justice
stevens,
the
plaintiff,
the
harmed
party,
would
certainly
want
an
injunction
against
those
2
weeks
ever
occurring
again.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
unless
you
have
an
effect,
you
cannot
get
injunctive
relief.
now
certainly
the
government
would
be
heard
adversely
to
that.
once
you
have
a
conspiracy,
an
attempted
conspiracy,
a
criminal
activity,
a
civil
plaintiff
would
certainly
want
to
be
able,
if
you
were
able
to
show
that,
to
have
injunctive
relief
and
if
the
intended
effect
or
as
mr.
justice
souter
says,
the
tendency
toward
to
have
an
effect,
would
certainly
give
the
court
jurisdiction.
if
there
is
an
ambiguity,
and
i
don't
think
there
is,
but
if
there
is
any
ambiguity,
the
way
you
resolve
an
ambiguity
in
language
is
to
look
at
what
the
court
did.
it
looked
at...
all
the
commentators
say
3
things...
i
think
you
looked
at
4
things:
mortgage
money,
secondary
mortgage
market,
title
insurance,
and
there's
one
phrase
in
the
opinion
that
appears
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
claim
arranged
for
an
out-of-state
relocation
with
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
claim.
now
what
logical
implication
did...
was
there
between
those
4
things?
mortgage
money
came
from
out
of
state.
secondary
mortgage
market...
some
of
the
mortgages
that
were
procured
by
the
sale
of
real
estate
which
the
commission
for
the
sale
was
price
fixed
were
sold
to
out
of
state.
title
insurance
companies,
some
of
which
to
insure
the
title
of
the
houses
that
were
sold
as
a
result
of
the
commission
were
from
out
of
state,
and
by
the
way,
the
record
was
some.
the
mortgage
money
was
some.
there
was
no
specific
definition
and
then
we
have
the
one
instance
in
terms
of
relocation.
was
there
a
nexus
requirement
that
this
court
said
that
the
affected
activity
must
have
some
nexus
to
that
activity
upon
which
you
found
jurisdiction?
i
think
if
you
examine
what
you
looked
at
and
what
chief
justice
in
writing
his
opinion
looked
at,
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
mr.
lawrence
silver
the
affected
activity?
peer
review
proceedings,
your
honor,
and,
and
peer
review
proceedings.
were
it...
improperly
motivated
peer
review
proceedings
is
the
affected
activity.
mr.
lawrence
silver
there
are.
and
in
this
case
if
the
peer
review
activity
is
improperly
motivated,
it
then
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
but
it
seems
to
me
what
we
have
said
and
what
we
have
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
that
the
peer
review
proceedings
or
the
door
by
which
you
get
into
the
hospital
to
practice
and
that
that
is
the
nexus
to
getting
to
the
interstate
commerce,
the
hospital--
mr.
lawrence
silver
--that's
hospital
peer
review
proceedings.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
silver
peer
review...
hospital
peer
review...
peer
review
proceedings
provide
in
its
entirety
the,
the
affected
activity
that
allows
the
door
to
be
closed.
mr.
lawrence
silver
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
silver
no,
your
honor,
none.
that
in
terms...
in
testing
what
is
the
relevant
market,
the
relevant
market
is
the
delivery
of
surgical
ophthalmological
services
at
a
hospital.
midway
hospital,
before
it
was
a
hospital,
was
a
piece
of
ground
they
built
the
hospital
and
before
they
could
allow
physicians
to
practice
there,
they
had
to
have
peer
review
proceedings.
some
of
which
resulted
in
admission.
some
of
which
resulted
in
non-admission.
that
is
the
nexus
between...
that
is
the
door
to
get
to
the
market
and
that's--
mr.
lawrence
silver
--those
are
the
relevant
markets.
mr.
lawrence
silver
the
relevant
affected
activity
is
bad
peer
review
as
distinguished
from
the
market
of
the
general
business
activity.
that's
why
he...
the
closing
account
my
brother
waxman
suggested
we
have
not
alleged
a
nexus.
we
have
alleged
a
nexus.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
we
alleged
a
nexus.
i'm
suggesting
we
didn't
have...
even
have
to
allege
the
nexus
under,
under
mclain.
but
we
did.
we
said
that
you
have
bad
peer
review
proceedings,
that
is,
an
affected
activity
when
it's
badly
motivated
and
you
use
that
peer
review
proceedings
to
stop
the
delivery
of
surgical
ophthalmological
services.
we
alleged
the
nexus.
we
alleged
the
affected
activity
and
we
alleged
the
economic
service
that
is
precluded.
we
can
allege
more.
we
were
never
given
that
opportunity.
we
certainly
can
allege
more.
mr.
lawrence
silver
in,
in
my
view
under
mclain?
mr.
lawrence
silver
you
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant...
one
of
the
things
is
that
the
plaintiff's
activities
involve
interstate
commerce
that
are
now...
involve
interstate
commerce.
and
we
have
alleged
and
we
can
allege
more,
but
we
have
alleged
dr.
pinhas
receives
medical...
medicare
patients
from
out
of
state.
it
is
obvious
that
we
haven't
alleged
it
that
he
has
medical
supplies
that
come
from
out
of
state,
inner-ocular
lenses
that
are
very
expensive
from
out
of
state
and
those
types
of
things,
so
we
have
alleged
some.
we
can
allege
more
in
terms
of
the
plaintiff's
activities.
that
would
bring
us
under
rex
hospital.
in
terms
of
under
the
defendant's
activities
we
have
all
of
the
defendants
of
various
states
in
which
they
are
involved.
those
are
the
activities
which
are...
that
show
interstate
commerce
and
which
i
think
give
us
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
a
general
business
activities'
test.
if
you
are
looking
for
an
affected
activity
it
is
peer
review
in
general
or
peer
review
and
specific
in
this
case.
i
think
peer
review
in
general
is
sufficient
to
satisfy.
we
don't
need
it.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
peer
review
in
general...
justice
scalia
if
you
have
one
ophthalmologist
who
is
wrongfully
removed
by
anti-competitive
purposes
from
this
hospital,
other
ophthalmologists
at
that
hospital
will
benefit.
other
physicians
may
also
benefit.
and
consequently,
when
the
ninth
circuit
said
there
was
a
nexus
because
the
peer
review
proceeding
in
general
in
my
view
or
peer
review
proceeding,
a
bad
one
in
an
alternative
view,
affects
the
hospital
and
its
delivery
of
interstate
commerce
activities
because
it
eliminates
one
competitor
from
that
market
for
competing
for
ophthalmologic
surgery
rooms,
for
general
surgery
rooms,
for
general
beds,
et
cetera.
and
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
determination.
they
made
a
fact
finding.
they
found
what
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
they
made
a
determination
that
once
you
have
an
anti-competitive
peer
review
proceeding,
you
can
remove
that...
when
you
remove
one
surgeon
from
the
hospital,
it
affects
the
whole
hospital
or
it
affects
their
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore,
you
pass
any
of
the
mclain
tests
in
any
of
the
circuits.
we're
happy
to
be
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
we
could
meet
the
circuit...
any
of
the
circuits
that
have
spoken.
in
this...
i
think
that
the
court
in,
in
various
opinions...
that
it
has
written
especially
in
mclain,
has
indicated
that
2
things
are
important
to
consider.
one,
expanding
concept
of
the
commerce
clause
is
the
expanding
concept
of
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act.
in
addition,
expanding
and
changing
concepts
of
business
as
mr....
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
mclain
and
changing
concepts
of
business
are
also
considered
under
the
sherman
act.
it
is,
if
i
may
paraphrase
two
justices
marshall,
it
is
both
a
constitution
and
magna
carta
upon
which
you
are
expounding.
the
constitution
in
the
sense
that
when
you
interpret
the
sherman
one
act
jurisdiction
you
are
interpreting
the
commerce
clause
because
of
all
of
your
cases
which
both
parties
have
cited
in
the
briefs.
so
you've
said
that.
in
addition,
to
the
extent
that
you
limit
access
to
the
federal
courts,
in
anti-trust
cases
you
limit
the
magna
carta
that
mr.
justice
marshall
so
properly
called
i
think
magna
carta
free
enterprise
in
topco.
in
terms
of
the
facts,
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
the
outrageous
conduct
to
the
defendants
in
this
case
was
to
when
they
found
that
the...
dr.
pinhas
would
not
agree
to
the
surgical
sham
contract
they
wanted
to
do
instead
of
the
assistant
surgery
rule...
and
think
of
the
anomaly
of
it
by
the
way.
here
they
are
in
february
saying,
you're
such
a
great
guy.
we
want
to
pay
you
$60,000
to
be
a
consultant.
and
then
in
april,
when
he
won't
return
the
contract,
they
summarily
suspend
him
and
basically
kick
him
out
of
that
hospital
and
impair
his
rights
to
get
into
other
hospitals.
they
then
have
this
sham
peer
review
proceeding
with
no
right
of
counsel,
cross
examination,
preclusion
of
witnesses,
ordering
me
off
the
hospital
grounds
under
threat
of
arrest,
threatening
witnesses,
and
lo
and
behold,
with
all
of
those
adverse
things
and
dr.
pinhas
standing
with
another
ophthalmologist...
you
can
read
this
record
and
see
how
well
they
did
cross
examination
and
of
other
things,
they
won
6
out
of
the
7
charges.
and
do
you
know
what
this
hospital
did?
it
filed
a
false
report
with
the,
with
the
federal...
with
both
the
state
and
the
federal
saying
that
the
summary
suspension
had
been
upheld.
and
as
a
result,
dr.
pinhas
has
had
peer
review
proceeding
problems
at
other
hospitals
as
a
direct
result
we've
attached
as
exhibit
b
to
our
appendix.
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
the
805
report
of
which
i
am
making
reference
was
not
available
when
we
filed
the
first
amended
complaint.
it
is
not
part
of
this
record.
i
filed
a
request
and
a
motion
with
the
ninth
circuit
to
have
the
ninth
circuit
take
judicial
notice
of
it.
i
don't
know
whether
they
did
or
they
didn't.
they
never
ruled
on
the
motion
to
take
judicial
notice.
it
is
part
of
your
record.
as
i
have
indicated
i
think
that
the
mclain
did
establish
the
general
business
activities'
test
as
a
result
of
what
you
looked
at
in
terms
of
the
situation.
if
it
involved
an
affected
activities'
test...
and
i
believe
by
the
way
that
judge
wiggins
did
not
apply
western
waste.
i
believe
that
he
applied
in
a
much
more
narrow
standard
we
fit
the
affected
activities'
test.
even
the
particularized
test
that
no
court
has
adopted,
no
circuit
court
has
adopted
but
which
is
argued
i
believe
by
the
petitioners
here.
we
can
meet
that
view
with
leave
to
amend
this
complaint.
we
can
allege
a
variety
of
things
which
can
occur.
needless
to
say
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
justification
for
the
particularize
which
we
would
have
to
show
that,
according
to
the
particularized
test,
that
interstate
commerce
was
adversely
affected
by
the
specific
removal
of
dr.
pinhas
from
the
staff.
no
circuit
has
ever
gone
that
far.
but
even
so
amendment
to
the
complaint
dealing
with
the
implications
of
that
clearly
can
be
done.
what
has
happened
is
a
result
of
this
peer
review
proceeding
is
nation
wide
through
the
national
reporting
statute
under
the
health
care
quality
improvements
act
reports
regarding
dr.
pinhas
go
nation
wide.
reports
go
to
the
board
of
medical
quality
assurance.
under
state
law
they're
required
to
be
distributed
to
every
hospital
which
he
is
a
member.
i
see
that
i
have
5
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
dedicate
that
5
minutes
to
the
government
if
i
may...
unless
anyone
has
any
questions.
