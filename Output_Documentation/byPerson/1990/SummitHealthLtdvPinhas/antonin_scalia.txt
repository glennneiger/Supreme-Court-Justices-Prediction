justice
scalia
mr.
waxman,
what,
what
do
you
do
about
our
opinion
in
mclain?
didn't
we
say
there
that
all
that
had
to
be
shown
was
a
logical
connection,
not,
not
between
the
particular
activity
at
interstate
commerce
but
that
between...
i
mean
the
particular
offense,
but
rather
between
the
business
activity
in
general
and
interstate
commerce,
namely
brokeraging?
justice
scalia
you
don't?
justice
scalia
price
fixing
in
general
or
price
fixing
in
this
particular
case
with
respect
to
these
particular
real
estate
transactions?
justice
scalia
mr.
silver,
what's
the,
what's
the
activity
here?
justice
scalia
general...
in
general?
i
mean
there
are
peer
review
proceedings
in
universities
in,
you
know,
all
sorts
of
areas
of
professional
life.
justice
scalia
so
it's,
it's
just
hospital
peer
review
proceedings
that's,
that's
the
relative
activity?
justice
scalia
in
general
or
just
the
peer
review
proceedings...
not
just
the
peer
review
proceedings
of
this
particular
hospital.
justice
scalia
by
hospital
peer
review
proceedings,
you
mean
peer
review
proceedings
in
all
hospitals
throughout
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
there...
i
mean
once
you
depart
from
the
particular
context
of
the
particular
offense,
i
don't
know
where
you
define
the
area.
why
couldn't
the
relavant
activity
be
hospital
services
or,
or
ophthalmology
services
more
limited
or
ophthalmologic
surgery?
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
the
relevant
activity?
justice
scalia
and
what's,
what's
the
test
for
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the,
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
but
it
does
say,
mr.
wallace,
respondent's
brokerage
activity,
not
brokerage
activity
in
general.
justice
scalia
it
at
least
does
insist.
it's,
it's
not
the
whole
line
of
commerce.
it's
that
portion
of
the
line
of
commerce
engaged
in
by
the
respondent.
justice
scalia
but
there's
almost
no
line
of
commerce
that
isn't,
you
know,
within
the
reach
of
the
federal
commerce...
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
if
the,
if
the
activity
in
question
is
within
the
reach
of
the
federal
government
with
the
commerce
power
and
if
there
is
a
restriction
of
competition
within
that
regardless
of
whether
the
actual
restriction
itself
impedes
commerce,
then
it's
covered.
is...
that's
your
position?
justice
scalia
let's,
let's
assume
i
believe
that
that
was
not
the
original
intent
and
that
it
was
thought
that
valentine
acts
and
other
state
acts
were
going
to
continue
to
apply.
what
would
be
left
that,
that
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
but
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government?
can
you
think
of
any
restriction
upon
competition
that
doesn't
affect
commerce
in
the,
in,
in
the
broad
sense
that
the
constitutional
provision
uses?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
congress
could
pass
a
law
regulating
teenage
baby
sitters?
you
think
we
would
strike
that
down
these
days?
justice
scalia
the
act
does
say
in
restraint
of...
in
restraint
of
commerce
among
the
several
states,
not
in
restraint
in
a
field
of
commerce
that
happens
to
be
among
the
states.
justice
scalia
but
that,
that
could
simply
mean
that
what
is
meant
by
commerce
is
broadest
meaning
of
commerce,
but
it
still
has
to
be
in
restraint
of
commerce.
it's
just
like
saying
if
congress
passes
a
law
saying
nobody
can
kill
a
ladybug
in
interstate
commerce,
interstate
commerce
if
given
the
broadest
possible
meaning,
but
you
still
have
to
kill
the
ladybug.
justice
scalia
but
i'm
saying
even
if
there
aren't
any
limits
on
the,
on
the
commerce
power,
there
may
be
limits
to
the
sherman
act.
