mr.
j.
mark
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principle
to
be
applied
in
this
case
is
that
jurisdiction
under
a
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
requires
an
allegation
and
if
controverted
proof
that
the
restraint
alleged
to
have
been
imposed
by
the
defendants
has
as
a
matter
of
practical
economics
a
not
insubstantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
accordingly
it
is
not
sufficient
to
allege
for
jurisdictional
purposes
as
dr.
pinhas
has
only
that
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendants
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
petitioners
believe
this
principle
stems
from
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
enacted,
the
case
interpreting
the
act
including
the
claim,
and
the
extent
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
start
by
looking
at
the
plain
language
of
the
act.
section
1
prohibits
those
conspiracies
in
restraint
of
trade
or
commerce
among
the
several
states.
the
purpose
of
that
language
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
was
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
supplement
the
acts
of
states
in
regulating
anti-competitive
activities
which
individual
states
could
not,
namely
anti-competitive
activities
which
went
beyond
the
state
and
went
from
state
to
state.
as
this
court
held
in
its
early
decision
apex
hoisery,
the
addition
of
the
words
were
commerce
among
the
states
was
the
means
to
relate
the
prohibited
restraint
of
trade
to
interstate
commerce
for
constitutional
purposes
so
congress
could
penalize
restraints
involving
or
affecting
interstate
commerce
which
it
perceived
as
the
reach
of
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
as
this
court
went
on
to
note
in
the
frankfort
distilleries
case,
this
results
in
an
obvious
distinction
between
a
course
of
conduct
wholly
within
a
state
often
referred
to
a
purely
local
and
conduct
which
although
local
in
an
inseparable
element
of
a
larger
program
which
depends
for
its
success
upon
activity
which
affects
commerce
among
the
several
states.
the
import
of
the
precise
language
of
section
1
has
been
highlighted
in
a
number
of
decisions
by
the
court.
most
notably
in
gulf
oil
corporation
v.
copp
paving,
a
case
which
the
court
relied
upon
in
its
subsequent
decision
in
mclain.
in
that
case,
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
the
language
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
language
of
the
clayton
act.
it
held
that
the
words,
restrain
of
trade
or
commerce
among
the
states,
meant
that
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
section
1
was
keyed
directly
to
effect
on
interstate
markets
and
the
interstate
flow
of
goods.
and
the
import
in
that
case
was
justice
marshall's
concurrence
in
gulf
oil
where
he
noted
that
the
phrase,
among
the
several
states,
embraces
all
commerce
save
or
except
that
which
is
confined
to
a
single
state
as
it
does
not
affect
other
states.
in
so
holding
the
court
went
on
to
state
that
as
a
result
of
its
provisions,
a
jurisdictional
inquiry
under
the
sherman
act
was
to
be
a
particular
one
focusing
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
presented
in
each
case.
the
reason
for
that
particularized
determination
was
the
need
to
identify
a
specific
restraint
because
congress
was
regulating
restraints
which
were
among
the
states.
that
need
would
not
exist
if
all
that
was
required
was
to
point
to
something
that
was
called
a
line
of
commerce
or
a
class
of
activities
to
create
jurisdiction.
it
would
be
as
if
this
court
simply
read
out
of
the
act
the
words
or...
among
the
states
and
commerce
among
the
states
and
simply
said
that
this
was
an
act
to
prohibit
restraints
of
trade
period.
that
is
not
what
the
act
says
and
its
plain
language
requires
more.
it
is
the
language
of
section
1
which
also
distinguishes
its
reach
from
other
cases
where
congress
itself,
other
statutes
where
this
court
has
considered,
that
congress
itself
has
defined
the
specific
persons
and
activities
that
affect
congress
and
therefore,
their
effect...
excuse
me...
they
affect
commerce
and
therefore
require
federal
regulation.
if
we
look
at
cases
such
as
perez
v.
united
states,
russell
v.
united
states,
even
heart
of
atlanta,
wickard
against
filburn,
those
are
all
cases
where
congress
has
engaged
in
specific
fact
finding
to
find
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
some
particular
evil
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
a
general
statute
such
as
the
sherman
act
has
not
been
accompanied
by
specific
congressional
findings
to
the
effect
that
a
class
of
activities
in
particular
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and
that's
why
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
it
is
required
to
engage
in
a
case
by
case
review
of
particular
allegations
and
particular
complaints
to
see
whether
in
fact
there
is
a
restraint
which
significantly,
substantially,
and
adversely
affects
interstate
commerce.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
well,
i
don't
read
mclain
that
way.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i
think
the
way
i
read
mclain
is
that
the
court
looked
at
a
situation
which
involved
a
brokerage
for
four
years
in
new
orleans
and
looked
at
an
alleged
conspiracy
to
fix
commission
rates
which
are
part
of
the
price.
and
the
price
would
affect
the
volume
of
sales
and
the
court
engaged
in
some
detailed
fact
finding
actually
based
on
a
real
record
to
say
that
that
volume
of
sales
affected
interstate
commerce
as
a
result
of
financing
from
out
of
state
or
title
insurance
that
came
from
out
of
state.
so
i
think
factually
one
can
distinguish
mclain
on
that
basis.
admittedly
there
is
language
in
mclain
which
we
find
to
be
ambiguous,
for
example,
and
does
talk
about
general
activities
in
the
brokerage
business
or
the
general
activities
of
one
of
the
parties.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
actual
test
that
mclain
established.
indeed,
chief
justice
burger
at
the
time
specifically
towards
the
end
of
the
opinion
restates
the
federal
jurisdictional
requirement
that
there
be
as
a
matter
practical
economics
a
not
insubstantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
by
the
restraint
that
has
been
allegedly
imposed
by
the
defendants.
so
in
the
case
mclain
the
restrain
that
was
allegedly
imposed
by
the
defendant
was
a
conspiracy
to
fix
an
inseparable
part
of
the
price
of
real
estate
and
that
price
fixing
activity
would
affect
as
the
court
found
by
looking
at
the
actual
facts
in
question
that
title
insurance
coming
in
from
out
of
state
in
very
significant
volumes
of
commerce.
this
was
a
case
that
involved
real
estate
brokers
throughout
new
orleans
over
a
period
of
4
years.
i
think
it's
also
note
worthy
in
looking
at
the
mclain
decision
itself,
several
things
to
indicate
that
mclain
did
not
attempt
to
set
a
new
rule.
i
think
some
commentators
have
suggested
that
it
did
set
a
new
rule.
first
of
all,
the
cases
relied
upon
by
mclain
are
for
example
gulf
oil,
goldfarb,
trustees
of
rex,
were
clearly
no
nude
rule
was
at
work
in
those
cases.
in
addition,
the
chief
justice
at
that
time
judge...
joined
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
jefferson
peers
v.
hyde
which
in
footnote
5
specifically
says
that
there's
got
to
be
an
effect
on
commerce
for
there
to
be
section
1
jurisdiction.
in
addition,
i
think
that
the
practice
this
court
has
engaged
in
over
time
is
to
stand
by
a
settled
authority
which
would
say
that
you
leave
statutory
interpretations
with
respect
to
jurisdictional
scope
in
place
and
leave
the
task
of
modifying
that
scope
to
congress.
there's
no
indication
in
the
decision
in
mclain
that
this
court
was
attempting,
if
you
will,
to
supplant
congress
and
in
petitioner's
view
amend
the
statute
to
read
out
the
words,
among
the
states.
so
i
would
distinguish
mclain
first
by
saying
that
i
think
it
is
distinguishable
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
second,
i
think
the
plain
reading
of
mclain
and
the
activity
that
was
actually
engaged
in
by
the
court
shows
that
the
court
simply
didn't
identify
real
estate
brokerage
activities
as
an
activity
and
say,
we
need
go
no
further.
the
court
i
think
went
through
great
pains
to
say
the
activity
we're
focusing
on
is
price
fixing
and
how
does
price
fixing
affect
real
estate
transactions.
so
i
don't
believe
mclain
stands
for
a
position
contrary
to
that
which
is
being
urged
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
import
of
the
question.
what
was
the
focus
of
that
case
was
price
fixing
in
commissions
by
all
the
brokers
in
new
orleans
for
a
period
of
4
years.
so
they
focused
on
that
particular
transaction
and
found,
in
at
least
my
reading
of
the
case,
found
that
that
was
part
of
setting
the
price.
so
if
the
brokers
commission
is
part
of
the
price
and
if
you're
going
to
affect
the
price,
you're
obviously
going
to
affect
the
volume
of
sales.
and
the
court
felt...
inclined
even
to
go
beyond
that
and
say,
well,
what
difference
did
it
make?
the
difference
it
made
were
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
out-of-state
financing,
title
insurance,
and
so
forth.
so
it
obviously
went
farther
than
that
to
reach
the
result.
as
i
mentioned
i
think
that
mclain
also
is
consistent
with
the
cases
that
preceded
it
and
the
2
cases
of
great
import
that
preceded
were
goldfarb
and
trustees
of
rex
hospital.
now
in
goldfarb
the
court
went
to
great
lengths
to
examine
the
particular
transactions
in
question,
that
was
the
legal
services
involved
in
that
case,
to
find
that
those
specific
legal
services
were
coincidental
with
the
interstate
real
estate
transactions
in
terms
of
time,
more
importantly
in
their
view,
in
terms
of
continuity.
the
critical
reason
for
that
determination
was
the
need
to
distinguish
essentially
local
restraints
which
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
interstate
commerce
and
the
specific
real
estate
services
provided
in
that
case
which
did
affect
interstate
commerce.
and
this
conclusion
i
believe
is
made
clear
by
the
language
in
goldfarb
which
specifically
recognizes
that
there
may
well
be
legal
services
which
have
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
if
one
need
only
identify
legal
services
as
a
line
of
business
or
a
class
of
activities
that
affect
commerce,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
first
trace
the
particular
relationship
of
the
activities
in
question
in
that
case
with
interstate
commerce
or
to
go
on
and
say
that
there
may
well
be
legal
services
which
may
have
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
well,
i
read
that
language
in
the
context
in
which
the
case
was
brought.
brokerage
activity
was
the
activity
which
was
affected
by
the
conspiracy
in
that
case.
it
was
the
activity
which
was
the
price
fixing
conspiracy
itself.
in
addition,
i
also
read
the
language
to
focus
on
a
slightly
different
point
which
is
that
in
order
to
make
the
jurisdictional
showing
you
need
not
prove
your
case.
you
need
not
prove
that
there
was
an
actual
effect
or
a
specific,
particular
effect
which
was
successful.
and
read
in
that
context,
i
don't
believe
that
this
language
changes
the
position
that
the
petitioners
are
espousing.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i
believe
that
the
court...
i
believe
that
it's
not
required
for
jurisdictional
purposes
that
you
prove
that
the
conspiracy
would
be,
would
have
been
successful.
and
in
that
sense,
it
is
different.
jurisdiction
is
more
of
a
threshold
inquiry.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
in
proving
your
case
on
the
merits,
i
still
believe
that
you
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
which
is
exactly
what
the
court
goes
on
to
state
that
towards
the
end
of
the
decision
where
it
indicates
that
either
side...
for
example,
it
says,
that
trial
respondents
will
have
the
opportunity
to
make
their
own
case
contradicting
this
factual
showing.
it
goes
on
to
indicate
that
they
may
be
able
to
show
then
in
fact
significant
amounts
of
interstate
commerce
are
not
required...
were
not
affected
or
that
they
were.
it
said,
petitioners
at
trial
may
be
able
to
show
that
respondents'
activities
have
a
not
insubstantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
so
the
court
apparently
found
that
for
the
substantive
offense
there
may
be
some
further
showing
before
there's
a
resulting
violation.
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
however,
the
court
was
not
going
to
require
the
same,
if
you
will,
degree
of
showing
to
show
that
jurisdiction
existed
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
the
same
language
applies
to
the
jurisdictional
finding
as
to
the
ultimate
offense
involved.
in
my
view
the
court
may
wish
to
preliminarily
examine
jurisdiction
before
concluding
that
there
is
in
fact
a
violation.
the
court
may
not
want
to
have
the
parties
go
through
he
entire
discovery
process
in
order
to
determine
whether
in
fact
it
has
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance.
so
in
my...
there
is
some
reason
to
go
about
that
process.
and
it
appears
that
mclain
in
fact
looked
at
the
case
that
way.
the--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--i
don't
believe
jurisdiction
would
exist
under
the
sherman
act
if
nothing
ever
happened.
that's
because
there's
a
requirement
that
there
actually
be
some
sort
of
restraint
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
the
conspiracy
would
be
the
heart
of
offense.
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
the
question
is
if
the
conspiracy
never...
didn't
go
anywhere,
didn't
affect
anything
whatsoever,
then
in
my
view
you
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
because
i
agree
i
don't
have
to
take
that
view.
and
one
could
stop
significantly
short
of
that
position
both
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
that
the
government
might
suggest.
i
don't
believe
the
view
is
required.
i
was
answering
the
question
i
guess
in
the
context
of
my
views
on
jurisdiction--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--as
opposed
to
the
successfulness
of
the
offense.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
no,
i
think
my
view...
no,
my
view
is
not
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
success
of
the
particular
conspiracy
that's
alleged,
but
that
its
logical
conclusion
would
have
resulted
in
a
restraint
which
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
well,
i'm
not,
i'm
not
sure
i
would
know
the,
the
real
difference
between
a
tendency
to
affect--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--no,
i
think
i
would
have
to
back
up
somewhat
from
what
i
said
and
indicate
that
what
they
actually
would
have
to
allege
is
that,
is
that
there
would
be
a
logical
connection
between
success,
if
you
will,
and
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
to
create
the
section
1
jurisdiction.
the
government's
view,
however,
is
significantly
different
than
that.
according
to
the
government,
one
need
only
show
that
the
anti-competitive
behavior
occurs
within
something
they
call
a
class
of
commercial
activity
which
affects
interstate
commerce
or
that
the
defendants
are
in
a
line
of
business
which
itself
affects
commerce
for
section
1
jurisdiction
to
be
established.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
that's
not
what
section
1
says,
one
can
envision
that
virtually
ever
activity
that
you
engage
in
on
a
daily
basis
actually
from
eating
to
clothing
yourself,
to
delivering
a
service
or
providing
for
shelter,
inevitably
has
some
role
as
a
class
of
activity
or
line
of
business
which
would
affect
interstate
commerce
in
the
aggregate.
accordingly,
the
government's
views
appear
too
broad
without
limitation
and
certainly
without
placing
any
credence
in
the
notion
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
have
unlimited
power.
moreover,
if
the
government's
views
were
correct,
this
court's
analysis
in
yellow
cab,
goldfarb,
trustees
of
rex
hospital,
and
even
the
language
of
mclain,
finding
a
real
commercial
relationship
between
the
anticompetitive
conduct
and
interstate
commerce
would
have
been
totally
unnecessary,
because
legal
services,
real
estate
sales,
hospital
building
in
and
of
themselves,
obviously
as
a
class
of
activities
significantly
affect
interstate
commerce.
acceptance
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
also
doesn't
mean
as
the
united
states
and
as
the
various
states
that
filed
an
amicus
brief
have
said
that
for
some
reason
anti-competitive
activities
will
go
unchallenged.
anti-competitive
activity
meriting
attack
on
a
truly
local
level
is
still
the
subject
of
enforcement
activity
at
that
level.
it's
well
to
remember
that
the
purpose
of
the
passage
of
the
sherman
act
was
to
supplement
state
antitrust
enforcement
efforts,
not
to
supplant
them.
this
court
has
already
recently
held
in
california
v.
arc
america
corporation
that
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
do
not
supplant
but
may
be
supplemented
by
other
local
state
government
enforcement
efforts.
now
the
principle
to
be
applied
in
this
case
requiring
a
restraint
which
has
a
not
insubstantial
effect
to
interstate
commerce,
also
mandates
that
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
interstate
commerce
be
reversed
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
without
any
factual
record
before
it
or
even
a
factual
allegation
by
the
plaintiff,
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
made
findings
that
peer
review
proceedings
in
and
of
themselves
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
peer
review
proceedings
affect
the
entire
medical
staff
of
a
hospital
and,
therefore,
interstate
commerce
is
affected.
now
both
of
these
statements
as
i
indicated
are
unsupported
by
any
record.
all
we
have
is
a
complaint
and
actually
they're
incorrect.
congress,
in
passing
the
health
care
quality
improvement
act,
noted
that
peer
review
is
not
essentially
commercial
activity
in
the
typical
case
and
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce
certainly
in
every
case
as
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
be
positing.
second,
the
conclusion
that
a
medical
staff
proceeding
or
even
a
series
of
medical
staff
proceedings
affect
either
the
hospital's
entire
medical
staff
in
every
case
or
the
hospital's
interstate
commerce
in
every
case
no
matter
who
was
or
was
not
actually
affected,
no
matter
what
the
scope
of
the
peer
review
proceeding
might
have
been.
again,
it's
simply
a
factual
assertion
that
is
nowhere
in
the
record
and
is
not
the
case,
in
particular
through
the
illustrations
by
the
amicus
hospital
associations.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
is
analogous
to
saying
because
i'm
a
member
of
the
california
bar
association
which
is
mandatory
in
california
that
i
am
somehow
affected
by
every
state
bar
disciplinary
proceeding
no
matter
what
the
subject
was,
no
matter
what
its
result
was,
whether
i
knew
about
it
or
i
didn't
know
about
it.
there
is
no
decision
where
the
court
has
gone
that
far
or
even
suggesting
that
somehow
interstate
commerce
is
implicated
every
time
someone
is
excluded
from
a
medical
staff,
an
organization,
an
association,
or
some
other
membership
and
for
that
reason,
the
government's
views
and
the
ninth
circuit's
views
are
simply
too
far.
in
short,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
decision
under
any
test
whether
it's
a
government's
test
or
whether
it's
a
test
that
petitioners
believe
should
be
applied,
should
be
reversed.
in
think
in
conclusion
the
court
should
reverse
that
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
holding
the
the
existing
allegations
of
the
complaint
were
adequate
to
assert
sherman
act
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
court
should
reaffirm
the
standard
required
for
section
1
jurisdiction
is
an
allegation
and
of
controverted
proof
that
anticompetitive
restraints
must
be
shown
as
a
matter
of
practical
economics
to
have
a
non-insubstantial
effect
on
the
interstate
commerce
involved.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i
do.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i
think
that
the
principles
that
are
involved
here
are
distinguishing
the
section
1
from
other
regulatory
commerce
clause
type
cases.
we're
fairly...
not
fairly...
we're
clearly
articulated
by
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
his
concurrence
in
the
hodel
against
virginia
surface
mining
case.
i
think
where
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
cases
such
as
perez,
russell,
heart
of
atlanta,
even
wickard
against
filburn
could
be
explained
by
what
professor
tribe
indicates
is
the
cumulative
effect
principle
wherein
those
cases
congress
engaged
in
specific
fact
findings,
stressing
the
regulation
of
local
incidence
as
an
activity
that
was
necessary
to
abate
a
cumulative
evil
affecting
national
commerce.
under
that
type
of
reasoning
commerce
can
clearly
adopt,
regulations
which
affect
child
labor
laws,
could
adopt
regulations
which
affect
commerce
and
agriculture,
could
adopt
many
acts
which
govern
specific
areas
such
as
the
civil
rights
laws
where
congress
itself
engaged
in
the
fact
finding
which
show
that
those
activities
affect
interstate
commerce.
but
despite
those
holdings
and
as
the
chief
justice
noticed
some
broad
dicta
in
those
holdings,
there
have
to
be
limits
and
there
are
limits
somewhere
on
the
commerce
power
and
those
limits
are
contained
in
the
language
of
section
1
itself.
restraints
of
trade
or
commerce
among
the
states.
neither
the
respondents
nor
the
government
chose
to
address,
justice
scalia,
your
question
about
what
must
that
language
mean,
restraint
of
trade
or
commerce
among
the
states.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i
think
one
could
read
it
either
way.
i
think
one
could
read
it
as
there
being
limits
on
the
commerce
power
but
the
court
need
not
go
that
far.
one
need
only
look
at
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
construe
the
statutory
language
to
say
jurisdiction
under
that
statute
requires
the
showing
the
petitioners'
request.
the
notion
that
the
government
seems
to
concede
that
the
2
teenage
baby
sitters
who
are
conspiring
to
fix
the
price
at
which
they
render
services
would
not
be
enough.
petitioners
agree
that
would
not
be
enough
although
congress
could
easily
call
this
the
line
of
commerce
involving
child
and
home
care
or
the
line
of
commerce
involving
care
of
children
throughout
the
country
which
would
obviously
have
significant
import
on
an
interstate
commerce
basis
for
the
economy
as
a
whole.
i
think
that
illustration
is
perhaps
the
best
illustration
of
why
the
principle
that
the
government
seeks
to
enforce
in
this
case
goes
too
far.
and
the
example--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--i
would
suppose
that
the
physicians
collectively
involved
in
that
case
would
allege
this
had
a
significant
affect
on
the--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--i
would
assume
that
that
one
physician
would
allege
that
this
conspiracy
which
affects
more
than
one
physician,
namely
any
physician
who
might
come
from
out
of
state
and
be
on
the
medical
staff
of
the
hospitals
collectively
in
that
area.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
if,
if--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--the
allegation
would
be
that
using
the
example
you
gave
is
that
more
than
this
physician
was
affected.
in
fact,
many
physicians
who
may
come
from
out
of
state
were
affected.
this
would
affect
their
own
medical
practices
involving
their
treatment
potentially
of
out-of-state
patients,
purchases
of
supplies,
purchases
of
equipment,
purchases
of
products,
the
ability
to
render
a
large
spectrum--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
he
would
not
have
to
show
given
the
example
you
gave
that
particular
incident
affecting
him.
he
was
the
only
physician--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--no.
if
he
was
the
only
physician
involved
as
the
subject
of
that
particular
conspiracy
and
the
affect
of
restraining
him
had
no
substantial
effect
on
out-of-state
patients,
out-of-state
of
purchases
of
supplies,
out-of-state
products
or
equipment,
then
he
would
not
be
able
to
stay
the
case
which
created
sherman
act,
section
1
jurisdiction
and
that
is
the
distinction
that
is
important
in
requiring
a
substantial
affect
on
interstate
commerce
as
a
result
of
these
specific
provisions
of
section
1.
on
that
basis,
the
petitioners
believe
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
and
affirm
the
dismissal
based
on
the
complaint
which
is
before
the
court
which
contains
no
allegations
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce,
no
allegations
with
respect
to
purchases
of
supplies,
equipment,
financing,
mortgage
money,
patients
affected,
or
any
of
the
other
indicia
that
have
been
used
in
any
case
involving
restraints
of
trade
among
the
states
to
find
jurisdiction
under
section
1.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
i
think
that
if
one
could
allege
and
ultimately
controvert
make
the
showing
that
the
conspiracy
to
impose
the
assistant
surgeon
requirement
had
a
specific
effect
on
a
volume
of
interstate
commerce
such
as
it
affected
the
total
volume
of
surgeries
at
a
significant
level
of
those
coming
from
out
of
state,
a
total
volume
of
supplies
that
would
be
involved
in
surgeries
which
could
no
longer
be
performed,
a
total
volume
of
individuals--
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
--yes.
mr.
j.
mark
waxman
finally,
the
notion
that
the
court
should
expand
the
sherman
act
simply
because
concepts
of
commerce
have
expanded
or
that
the
sherman
act
is
the...
the
magna
carta
is
no
substitute
for
the
specific
congressional
intent
which
is
evidence
in
the
act
itself
which
says
restraints
of
trade
of
commerce
among
the
states
and
the
court
should
not
single
mindedly
decide
as
i
indicated
at
the
beginning
to
eliminate
that
phrase
from
the
act.
thank
you.
