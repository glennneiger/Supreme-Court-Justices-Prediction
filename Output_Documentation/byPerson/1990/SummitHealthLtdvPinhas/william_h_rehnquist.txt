we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1679,
summit
health,
limited
v.
pinhas.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
waxman,
i,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
about
mclain,
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
question.
there
is
some
rather
specific
language
there
at
page
242
of
444
u.s....
it
says,
petitioners
need
not
make
the
more
particularized
showing
of
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
caused
by
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
fix
commission
rates.
and
the
sentence
before
that
says,
it,
it's
enough
if
you're
showing
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
generated
by
the
brokerage
activity.
now,
it
seems
to
me
those
2
sentences
certainly
are,
are
not
themselves
ambiguous,
that
you,
you
can
show
it
by
showing
the
activity
that
the
plaintiffs,
rather
that
the
defendants
are
in.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
actual
restraint
affected
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
you
think
the
court
has
a
different
thing
in
mind
for
a
jurisdictional
showing
as
a,
as
opposed
to
the,
the
showing
you
have
to
make
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
would
you
have
to...
in
proving
your
case
on
the
merits
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
show
the
conspiracy
was
successful,
would
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
really
make
a
lot
of
sense
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
silver,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
no
geographic
limit
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
silver.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
why,
why
again,
mr.
wallace,
is
the
doctor
case
different
from
the
nurse's
for
anti-trust
purposes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
take
it
a
nurse
might
allege...
make
the
same
allegations
that
she
assists
faster
at
operations
than
the
other
nurses
and
she's
been
discriminated
against
for
that
reason.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
usually
dicta
anyway
in
those
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
waxman,
do
you
have
rebuttal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1679,
summit
health
limited
versus
pinhas
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
