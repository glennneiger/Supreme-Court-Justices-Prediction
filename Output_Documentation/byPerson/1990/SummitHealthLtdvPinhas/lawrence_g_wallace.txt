mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
way
the
courts
of
appeals
have
described
the
conflict
that
has
developed
in
applying
mclain
is
something
of
a
false
dichotomy.
they
generally
say
that
on
the
one
side
some
courts
have
held
that
the
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
any
of
the
defendant's
activities
or
the
defendant's
general
business
activities
affect
commerce
and
on
the
other
side,
courts
say
the
question
is
whether
the
challenged
conduct,
the
allegedly
illegal
conduct
in
itself
affects
commerce.
the
relevant
inquiry
for
analyzing
a
sherman
act
claim
is
what
is
the
line
of
commerce
or
the
line
of
business
activity
being
restrained
by
the
alleged
violation
and
it
is
in
our
view
that
line
of
activity
that
must
satisfy
the
interstate
commerce
nexus,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
also
engaged
in
additional
business
activities
that
affect
commerce
and
whether
or
not
the
alleged
unlawful
conduct
in
itself
also
affects
congress.
and
when
mclain
is
read
in
that
light,
we
believe
that
it
contains
no
ambiguity.
in
that
case,
the
complaint
was
about
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
among
real
estate
brokerage
firms.
the
court
did
not
have
before
it
whether
some
of
the
defendants
were
also
engaged
in
other
business
activities,
property
management
for
example,
because
those
activities
would
have
been
irrelevant
to
the
restraint
being
alleged
and
in
that
light,
the...
two
sentences
from
the
opinion
that
we
have
set
forth
on
page
8
of
our
brief
to
which
chief
justice
rehnquist
has
already
alluded
seem
entirely
clear
to
us.
the
court
first
says
it
would
be
sufficient
for
petitioners
to
demonstrate
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
generated
by
respondent's
brokerage
activity.
petitioners
need
not
make
the
more
particularized
showing
of
an
effect
on
commerce
caused
by
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
fix
commission
rates
or
by
those
other
aspects
of
respondent's
activities
alleged
to
be
unlawful.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--respondent's
brokerage
activities
and
then
there,
there
is
a
further
question
whether
their
effect
on
commerce
should
be
looked
upon
in
isolation
or
as
one
of
a
class
of
activities
that
congress
can
regulate,
but
before
that
question
arises
i
want
to
refer
to
language
appearing
later
in
the
mclain
opinion
which
some
courts
have
used
to
inject
ambiguity
into
the
opinion
and
this
appears
at
page
4...
246
of
444
u.s.
and
the
sentence
is
at
the
very
top
of
the
page,
to
establish
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
there
remains
only
the
requirement
that
respondent's
activities
which
allegedly
have
been
infected
by
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
must
be
shown
as
a
matter
of
practical
economics
to
have
a
not
insubstantial
effect
on
the
interstate
commerce
involved.
in
context,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
respondent's
activities
which
have
been
infected
refers
to
the
brokerage
activities.
if
this
sentence
is
to
be
read
consistently
with
what
the
court
so
clearly
said
just
a
few
pages
earlier
rather
than
to
read
this
sentence
circuitously
to
contradict
what
the
court
had
already
said
without
ambiguity.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
in
mclain
did
what
it
was
striving
to
do
in
the
context
of
the
argument
that
was
before
it
which
was
to
reconcile
its
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act
with
the
general
trend
of
this
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
the
perez
case
had
already
been
decided
at
that
time
and
features
very
heavily
in
the
arguments
before
the
court
and
the
court
was
well
aware
of
the
generous
scope
of
the
commerce
power
that
has
been
recognized
in
the
jurisprudence.
now
in
the
case
at
hand
the
alleged
restrain
enforced
through
the
sanction
of
peer
review
is
on
the
provision
of
hospital
ophthalmological
services.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
sanctions
were
adopted
to
prevent
the
respondent
physician
from
providing
more
efficient
services
to
patients
through
faster
operations
and
through
elimination
of
an
assistant
surgeon
in
attendance
at
the
operations.
it
is
a
charge
therefore
of
anti-competitive
practices,
of
injury
to
competition
in
a
particular
market
and
the
provision
of
these
ophthalmological,
surgical
services.
what
if
instead
a
nurse
had
complained
that
she
had
been
excluded
from
providing
services
in
this
activity,
services
which
she
seeks
to
provide
in
the
same
manner
that
they
are
provided
by
other
nurses?
that
would
seem
on
the
face
of
it
to
be
a
less
substantial
anti-trust
complaint.
but
that
is
so
it
seems
to
us
not
because
the
nurses
employment
relationship
with
the
hospital
is
beyond
congress'
power
to
reach
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
obviously
can
be
reached
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
osha,
the
aged
employment...
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act,
et
cetera.
but
on
the
face
of
this
complaint
she
has
not
claimed
an
injury
to
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
just
an
injury
to
herself
which
is
at
most
an
injury
to
a
particular
competitor
rather
than
to
competition,
not
what
the
anti-trust
laws
are
designed
to
protect.
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--she
might
be
able
to
build--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--enough
of
an
allegation
to
surmount
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
it's,
it's
questionable
whether
even
with
the
elements
you
have
added,
mr.
justice,
that
that's
still...
would
allege
an
injury
to
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
whether
she
could
show
that
anyone
other
than
herself
is
affected
by
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
his
complaint
is
that
competition
in
the
provision
of
ophthalmological
services
has
been
the
very
object
of
the
peer
review
sanction
that
was
applied
against
him.
he
said
that
he
performs
the
operations
faster
than
other
physicians
at
the
hospital,
thereby
saving
the
patients
from
risks
that
are
inherent
in
these
corneal
transplant
operations
from
greater
exposure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
happen.
but,
of
course,
the
case
i
posited
was
one
where
she
just
claims
she
wants
to
provide
services
in
the
same
manner
that
they
are
being
provided
by
others.
and
another
key
part
of
the
doctor's
complaint
was
that
he
thought
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
an
assistant
surgeon
and
this
was
adding
an
element
of
great
cost
to
the
operations.
so
what
was
involved
in
this
complaint
was
a
fairly
classic
allegation
of
injury
to
competition.
our,
our
point
here
in
showing
that
the
nurses
employment
relationship
really
is
within
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power
even
though
her
complaint
may
not
allege
an
injury
to
competition
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
requirement
of
the
sherman
act
should
not
be
distorted
into
an
improper
and
ill-fitting
tool
with
which
to
try
to
perform
the
substantive
screening
operation
of
identifying
insubstantial
anti-trust
complaints.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
the
point
made
by
the
22
states
that
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
agreeing
with
our
position
and
pointing
out
that
at
least
one
state
doesn't
have
any
state
antitrust
laws
at
all
and
pointing
out
deficiencies
in
other
state
anti-trust
laws
and
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
great
reliance
on
the
sherman
act
as
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
one
hypothetical
we
have
discussed
is
an
agreement
among
teenage
baby
sitters
to
fix
prices.
that
could
possibly
be
an
example.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--perhaps
not.
perhaps
not.
certainly
if
there
were
two
agencies
that
agreed
to
fix
prices
between
themselves,
it
might
be
shown
to
be
affecting
attendance
at
the
theatre
and
at
sports
events
and
at
concerts
and
could
have
an
effect
on
congress.
the
commerce
power
is
very
far
reaching.
it
did
reach
the
extortions
involved
in
perez
which
were
not
themselves
interstate
in
nature.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
not
painting
on
a,
a
new
slate
here
in
interpreting
that
language.
this
court
has
said
numerous
times
that
that
provision
was
intended
to
reach
to
the
utmost
extent
of
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
all
respect,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
those
cases
which
said
that
the
protection
that
congress
afforded
reached
to
the
utmost
extent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it,
it,
it,
it,
it
could
be
considered
that,
but
it
has
been
the
basis
for
expanding
the
reach
of
the
sherman
act
repeatedly
as
the
court's
notions
of
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause
have
similarly
expanded
because
the,
the
act
has
been
interpreted
to
afford
the
protections
to
whatever
is
the
currently
accepted
notion
of
the
reach
of
the
commerce
power.
so
it's
a
form
of
dictum
that
could
arguably
part
of
the
ratio
decidendi
of
those
case.
and
another
lesson
of
this
court's
commerce
clause
decisions
such
as
wickard
against
filburn
is
that
the
substantiality
of
the
effect
on
commerce
is
not
to
be
belittle
by
viewing
an
individual
instance
in
isolation
without
regard
to
the
aggregate
affect
of
similar
restraints
on
individuals
or
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
sanction
applied
to
this
one
individual,
the
deterrent
effect
on
others
of
similarly
attempting
to
increase
efficiency
by
similar
activities
if
they
see
that
this
doctor
can
be
sanctioned
for
trying
to
eliminate
the
assistant
surgeon
from
this
procedure.
and
these
cumulative
effects
which
can
be
wide
spread
but
relatively
minor
in
the
individual
infractions
are
important
to
our
enforcement
programs
as
we've
accounted
on
page
15
of
our
brief.
