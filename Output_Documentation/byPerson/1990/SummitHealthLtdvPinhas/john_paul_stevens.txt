justice
stevens
may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
what
you...
supposing
they
allege
a
brokerage
conspiracy
such
as
you
describe.
they
prove
that
the
defendants
all
got
together
in
a
room
and
agreed
on
a
fixed
rate
of
brokerage
and
then
2
weeks
later
they
all
decided
they
would
abandon
the
agreement.
they
didn't
do
it...
but
for
2
weeks
they
had
this
agreement
in
place
and
it
just
never
affected
a
single
transaction.
would
a
crime
have
been
committed
or
not?
justice
stevens
so
you
really
have
to
prove
more
to
prove
jurisdiction
than
you
do
to
prove
the
crime,
because
it's
kind
of
a
horn-book
law
that
the
conspiracy
itself
is
the
heart
the
offense
under--
justice
stevens
--why
do
you...
why
do
you
have
to
take
that
view?
couldn't,
couldn't
you
take
the
view
which
is
still
a
good
deal
short
of
what
the
government
proposes
that
the
test
it
whether
the
conspiracy,
if
successful,
would
have
actually
affected
interstate
commerce?
justice
stevens
but
you--
justice
stevens
--your
view
is
that
there
actually
has
to
be
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
not,
not
what...
it's
just
not
that
if
it
were
successful
there
would
have
been
an
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
allege...
let
me
just
be
sure
i
get
your
point...
what
if
they
allege
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
require
an
assistant
position
in
all
cases
and
that
conspiracy
restrains
trade
because
it
imposes
unnecessary
costs
on
that
line
of
commerce
and
then
he
alleges
as
a
by-product
of
that
agreement
they
won't
let
me
have
hospital
privileges
because
i
refuse
to
practice
with
an
assistant.
does
that
state
a
claim?
justice
stevens
but
your
answer
is
yes?
yes.
what
you're
saying
is
yes?
justice
stevens
yeah.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
a
successful
ophthalmological
surgeon
practicing
in
los
angeles.
he
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleging
that
the
petitioner,
summit
health
midway
hospital
center,
its
medical
staff,
and
others
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
drive
him
out
of
business
because
he
refused
to
adhere
to
their
requirement,
that
he
used
an
unnecessary
assistant
in
his
eye
surgery
and
he
refused
their
subsequent
offer
of
a
sham
contract
in
which
they
would
pay
him
for
services
that
he
would
not
actually
perform.
he
claim
that
other
doctors,
including
some
of
the
petitioners,
had
entered
the
conspiracy
and
used
the
peer
review
process
to
exclude
him
from
providing
ophthalmological
services
in
order
to
capture
a
greater
share
of
the
los
angeles
market
for
themselves.
among
his
allegations
was
a
claim
that
the
conspiracy
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court
granted
the
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reinstated
his
anti-trust
claim.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
petitioners'
contention
that
the
complaint
fails
to
satisfy
the
jurisdiction
requirements
of
the
sherman
act
because
it
does
not
describe
a
factual
nexus
between
the
alleged
boycott
and
interstate
commerce.
the
case
involves
an
alleged
restraint
in
the
practice
of
ophthalmological
services.
the
restraint
was
accomplished
by
an
alleged
misuse
of
a
congressionally
regulated
peer
review
process,
which
respondent
characterizes
as
a
gateway
that
controls
access
to
the
market
for
his
services.
the
gateway
was
closed
to
him
both
at
midway
and
at
other
hospitals
because
petitioners
insisted
upon
adhering
to
an
unnecessarily
costly
procedure.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
anti-trust
claim
that
members
of
the
peer
review
committee
conspired
with
others
to
abuse
that
process
and
deny
him
access
to
the
market
or
ophthalmological
services
provided
by
general
hospitals
in
los
angeles
as
a
sufficient
nexus
with
interstate
commerce
to
support
federal
jurisdiction.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
o'connor,
kennedy,
and
souter
have
joined.
