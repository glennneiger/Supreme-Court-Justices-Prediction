unknown
speaker
mr.
boger,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
massiah
violation,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
they
said
they
were
divided
as
to
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
clear
to
me,
counsel,
why
worthy's
testimony
is
the
critical
turning
point.
why
couldn't
evans
have
testified
and
established
at
least
some
of
the
basis
for
the
massiah
claim?
unknown
speaker
they
knew
who
evans
was,
and
they
had
the
opportunity
to
depose
him,
or
at
least
to
ask
the
district
court
for
permission
to
depose
him--
unknown
speaker
--under
rule
6.
unknown
speaker
evans
said
nothing
about
conversations
with
police
officials
or--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
the,
your
theory
now
that
evans
cooked
up
this
story
about
being
a
relative
of
one
of
the
parties
with
the
police
or
that
he
invented
all
this
on
his
own?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
was
evident
at
the
time
you,
let's
not
use
the
word
abandon,
declined
to
proceed
with
the
massiah
claim.
the
man
on
the
mission
theory
was
visible,
it
was
obvious--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
there
in
the
statement
that
wasn't
in
his
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
your
predecessor
ask
for
or
attempt
to
obtain
the
written
statement?
unknown
speaker
and
that
led
to
the
in
camera
hearing?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
at
the
time
of
the
first
habeas
there
was
at
least
a,
some
degree
of
suspicion
that
there
might
have
been
a
massiah
violation.
unknown
speaker
why
wasn't
that
the
time
to
make
every
effort
to
get
that
written
statement,
which
presumably
would
have
been
very
germane
evidence?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
you,
the
file
didn't
include
the
written
statement,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
but
i...
then
i,
i
am
confused
on
the
facts
then,
because
i
thought
you
had
an
indication
from
the
in
camera
ruling
at
the
time
of
trial
that
there
was
a
written
statement.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
identified
to
this
extent.
it
was
said
he
has
a
statement,
referring
to
evans.
he
has
a
statement
which
was
furnished
to
the
court,
but
it
doesn't
help
your
client.
unknown
speaker
what
could
that
have
referred
to,
unless
it
was
this?
unknown
speaker
this
wasn't
the
prosecutor.
this
statement
was
made
by
the
trial
court,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
statement
by
the
trial
court
during
cross-examination.
your
predecessor
objected
to
cross-examination
by
the
assistant
district
attorney,
indicating
that
he
had
asked
for
all
statements,
and
the
trial
court
said
he
has
a
statement
which
was
furnished
to
the
court,
but
it
doesn't
help
your
client.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
wasn't
it
clear...
i
am
sorry.
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
could
mean.
he
has
a
statement
which
was
furnished
to
the
court.
what
could
that
possibly
refer
to
except
a
written
statement?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
that
this
statement
was
in
the
file
and
was
withheld?
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
we
know
it
wasn't
provided
in
the
file,
but
do
we
know
that
the
whole
file
that
the
prosecutor
had
was
not
provided?
unknown
speaker
is
that
kind
of
a
question
a
question
on
which
we
only,
we
accept
the
fact
finder's
determination?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
that
seems
to
me
like
a
question
of
whether...
like
a
harmless
error
question.
would
a
jury
even
without
this
have
reached
the
same
conclusion,
trying
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
jury
would
be?
we
certainly
don't
say
whatever
the
district
court
says
on
that
we
are
bound
by.
and
this
is
the
same
thing--
unknown
speaker
--well,
couldn't
all
of
this
have
occurred
on
a
second
examination
of
your
massiah
claim,
and
you
would
have
just
been
permitted
under
the
successive
petitions
rule
to
file
a
successive
petition
based
on
new
evidence?
in
other
words,
the
reason
we
are
in
this
position
is
because
the
claim
wasn't
pursued
at
first.
we
are
not
sure
whether
or
not
all
this
would
have
come
out
or
not,
because
you
declined
to
pursue
the
claim
in
the
first
habeas.
if
you
had
done
that,
run
up
against
the
barn
wall
and
then
found
this
out,
i
would
assume
that
you
would
have
not
been
barred
by
the
successive
petition
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
assuming
that
the
statement
has
come
to
light
between
the
time
your
first
federal
habeas
has
been
denied
and
your
second,
and
your
second
run
at
it.
you
wouldn't
have
been
barred
under,
if
you
had
new
evidence,
as
i
understand
the
successive
petition
rule.
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
unknown
speaker
but
with
one
difference.
we
would
then
have
known
for
sure
that
you
could
not
have
discovered
this
evidence
if
you
had
pursued
your
claim
diligently.
but
you
prevent
us
from
making
that
determination
by
not
pursuing
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
think
the
standard
is?
that
counsel
must
apply
some
reasonable
competence
standard
in
pursuing
these
claims
and
investigations?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
we
make
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
finding
that
in
any
event
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
this
new
evidence
would
have
altered
the
verdict?
unknown
speaker
ben
wright
had
given
a
confession
to
evans
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
mccleskey
had
given.
unknown
speaker
did...
refresh
my
recollection.
didn't
they
have
evidence
of
another
confession?
another
defendant?
unknown
speaker
another
admission?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
boger.
ms.
westmoreland,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
state
have
this
evans
statement
in
some
file?
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
told
the
defense
counsel
that
they
were
turning
over
all
the
files
and
witness
statements?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
counsel
for
whom?
counsel
for
the
state?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
this
statement
that
was
presented
to
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that?
unknown
speaker
and
then
after
that
when
he
was
asked
for
the
full
file
he
didn't
include
this
statement?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
it
different.
didn't
he
say
he
turned
over
the
whole
file?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
i
want
to,
i
am
trying
to
follow
it.
are
you
trying
to
convince
us
that
defense
counsel
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
statement?
unknown
speaker
but...
the
answer
is
yes,
you
are
trying
to--
unknown
speaker
--and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
the
contrary
on
that.
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
you're
asking
us
to
disagree
with
the
finding
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
where
does
that
appear,
this
statement
that
you
are
just
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
and
at
what
point
in
the
proceedings
was
this
deposition?
unknown
speaker
in
the
state
habeas
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
and
did
he
acknowledge
that
it
was
evans'
statement,
or
just
a
written
statement?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is,
but
the
testimony
at
25
refers
to
a
statement
from
ollie
evans
that
was
introduced
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
suppose
counsel
didn't
say,
may
i
see
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
deliberately,
they
deliberately
decided
not
to
take
a
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
in
view
of
his
earlier
question
where
he
thought
he
was
asking
about
a
statement
given
at
trial,
he
probably
assumed
the
answer
was
responsive
to
his
question.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
state's
position
that
counsel
made
a
mistake?
unknown
speaker
and
this
man
shall
die
because
of
his
mistake.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
testimony,
i
don't
have
it
clearly
in
mind,
that
the
prosecutor,
in
effect,
assured
defense
counsel
that
defense
counsel
had
the
entire
file?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purpose
of
showing
whether
the
defense
counsel
had
not
well
represented
his
client.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
just
kind
of
looking
at
the
picture
of
all
the
whole
proceedings
went
on,
the
only
thing
that
never
got
in
defense
counsel's
hands
was
this
statement.
how
does
that
happen?
i
mean
genuinely,
i
mean
when
a
defense
lawyer
is
trying
to
get
access
to
all
statements
and
pertinent
records,
how
does
it
just
so
happen
there
is
one
very
important
document
somehow
gets
lost?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
he
doesn't
have
the
burden
of
showing
a
brady
violation.
he
is
just
trying
to
explain
why
he
didn't
pursue
this
claim,
and
he
says
he
didn't
have
a
very
important
piece
of
evidence
and
the
state
is
responsible
for
not
making
it
available.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
saying
you're
not
responsible.
unknown
speaker
did
mccleskey
take
the
stand
at
his
trial?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
standard
is
that
we
apply
in
evaluating
these
abuse
of
the
writs
claims?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
reasonable
competence
standard,
basically?
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
a
determination
in
the
courts
below
whether
that
standard
had
been
met,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
think
that
is
the
standard,
what
should
we
do
here?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
somewhere
along
the
line...
do
you
have
any
comment
to
make
about
pending
legislation
in
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
possible
if
you
prevail
here
that,
and
that
legislation
is
passed,
it
might
be
a
meaningless
prevailing.
as
i
understand
it,
bills
have
passed
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
although
they
are
different.
unknown
speaker
have
they
come
out
of
conference
committee?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
defending
the
seventh,
not
only
the
seventh...
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment,
but
its
reasons?
unknown
speaker
so,
and
you
don't
claim
that,
under
2244,
that
the
successive
petition
should
be,
should
be
dismissed
because
the
new
factual
ground
was
deliberately
withheld?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
accept
the
findings
that
the
defendant
didn't
know
about
this,
about
this
new
factual
ground
he
presents,
i
can't...
you
can't
say
it
is
deliberately
withheld.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
2244
says
deliberately
withheld
or
other
abuse
of
the
writ.
so
you
must
be
relying
on
"or
other
abuse
of
the
writ."
unknown
speaker
and
tell
me
what
the
abuse
of
the
writ
was.
unknown
speaker
the
legal
issue
was,
but
the
factual
matter
that
he
presents
was
something
he
didn't
know
about.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
go
ahead.
so
he
didn't,
he
didn't
present
the
massiah
claim
in
his
first
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
talked
to
some
police
officers.
he
just
didn't
get
around
to
talking
to
worthy.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
there
was
ineffective
counsel
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
eleventh
circuit
seemed
to
say
that
because
the
massiah
claim
had
been
made
once
and
had
been
rejected,
and
that
counsel,
that,
nevertheless
there
was
no
excuse
for
counsel,
just
because
he
thought
it
was
a
poor
claim,
there
was
no
excuse
for
him
not
presenting
it
in
the
second
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
need
to
go
on
and
say
all
that.
i
thought
it
said
that
just
because
they
knew
of
the
claim
and
it
had
been
presented
once,
that
he
should
have
presented
it
in
the
first
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what.
unknown
speaker
part?
wasn't
it
an
independent
ground?
unknown
speaker
on
the
second
prong,
what
do
you
understand
the
standard
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
with...
what
is
the
duty
of
counsel
in
making
the
investigation?
all
they
said
was
he
didn't
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
it
almost
reads
as
though
the
failure
to
discover
the
key
facts
is
enough
to
kill
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
did
those
records
disclose
the
name
of
worthy?
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
the
big
thing
they
missed,
i
guess,
was
not
interviewing
him.
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
they
could
have
found
him
on
the
basis
of
any
of
those
records?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
they
find
him
later?
worthy.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
your
position
that
none
of
these
factors
are
linked
to
the
21-page
statement?
unknown
speaker
if
the
prosecutor
knew
all
of
that,
why
did
they
violate
the
massiah
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
you
couldn't
raise
it
at
this
late
point.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
the
merits
of
the
massiah
rule?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
westmoreland.
mr.
boger,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
did
evans
testify
on
the
first--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
first
day?
unknown
speaker
he
said
on
the...
i
thought
what
you
just
read
said
he
had
gotten
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
that
testified
on
the
first
day.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i'm
not
sure
how
that
fits
in
with...
what
does
that
show?
does
that
show
that
the
state
was
therefore
in
bad
faith?
he
was
just
under
a
misimpression
as
to
what
he
had
received.
that
still
doesn't
mean
that
when
the
information
is
later
turned
over
and
the
affiant
says
i
provided
the
entire
file,
this
is
the
entire
file
that
i
provided
to
him,
it
still
wouldn't
make
that
a
lie,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about
a
cover-up
afterwards,
that
is
what--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
boger,...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
comment
about
the
pending
legislation?
unknown
speaker
do
neither
one
of
you
really
know?
