ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
this
court
again
challenging
petitioner's
1978
murder
conviction
and
armed
robbery
convictions
and
the
resulting
death
sentence.
before
i
proceed
to
the
issues,
let
me
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
do
not
believe
this
is
a
case
of
state
concealment.
it
is
not
a
case
of
state
perjury
and
lies,
as
has
been
characterized
by
the
petitioner
both
in
brief
and
in
oral
argument
before
this
court
this
morning.
it
is--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
what
the
state
did.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
if
i
may
clarify
exactly
what
did
take
place
in
relation
to
that.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
think
there
are
some
pertinent
facts
the
court
needs
to
know.
if
i
may
backspace
to
the
trial
for
one
moment,
counsel
did
present
two
documents
to
the
trial
court
for
an
in-camera
inspection.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
for
the
state.
the
assistant
district
attorney.
trial
counsel
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
were
two
documents.
trial
counsel
testified
he
knew
one
was
some
grand
jury
testimony
and
one
was
a
statement
of
a
witness
who
was
not
named
to
him
at
that
time.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
this
statement.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
parker
subsequently,
your
honor,
mr.
parker
being
the
assistant
district
attorney.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
it's
misleading
to
say
he
was
asked
for
the
full
file.
that
is
not
the
request
that
was
made
of
mr.
parker.
mr.
parker's
deposition--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no,
your
honor,
mr.
parker
did
not
say
that.
what
mr.
parker
says,
if
you
review,
and
i
believe
the
pertinent
part
of
his
deposition,
part
of
his
deposition
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
his
entire
deposition
is
in
the
record.
his
deposition
was
taken
for
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
at
the
beginning
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
mr.
stroup
requested
that
the
court
do
something
in
the
way
of
either
a
continuance
or
delay
the
proceedings
because
he
had
subpoenaed
mr.
parker
to
come.
he
wanted
mr.
parker,
he
wanted
the
portion
of
mr.
parker's
file
shown
to
defense
counsel
so
he
could
use
it
to
cross-examine
defense
counsel
about
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
the
continuance
was
denied,
but
counsel
was
allowed
to
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
parker,
which
was
done
in
february
of
that
year.
mr.
parker
came
to
the
deposition,
and
one
of
the
very
first
inquiries
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
do
you
have
the
file
that
i
asked
for,
the
investigative
file
that
was
turned
over
to
defense
counsel.
mr.
parker
reiterates
in
his
response
i
have
the
file
that
i
turned
over
to
defense
counsel.
that
is
what
i
have
with
me.
this
is
the
same
file
that
i
turned
over
to
defense
counsel.
it
is
said
several
different
times
throughout
this
entire
deposition.
the
agreement
that
was
reached
in
that
deposition
was
that
a
copy
of
the
file
would
be
substituted,
and
the
agreement
that
was
reached
was
we
were
talking
about
the
file
made
available
to
defense
counsel.
there
is
no
statement
by
mr.
parker
at
any
time
that
he
is
turning
over
the
matter,
which
obviously
was
not
in
the
file
made
available
to
defense
counsel,
that
is
the
two
documents,
part
of
the
in-camera
inspection.
mr.
parker
goes
on,
and
this
is
part
of
the
joint
appendix--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
what
i
am
trying
to
explain,
convince
the
court
of
the
fact
that
defense
counsel
certainly
was
told
there
was
a
statement--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
he
should
have
been.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
either
disagree
with
that
finding
of
fact,
your
honor,
or
on
the
other
hand
conclude
if
counsel
was
not
subjectively
aware
of
it,
it
certainly
was
not
concealed
from
him.
and
the
fact
that
he
was
not
aware
of
it
was
not
through
any
state
concealment
of
this
particular
document
in
question.
that
is
particularly
the
case
when
during
examination
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
during
his
deposition,
the
assistant
district
attorney
specifically
states,
when
you
are
talking
about
offie
evans,
there
is
a
statement
of
offie
evans.
it
was
not
introduced
at
trial,
it
is
part
of
the
matter
of
which
the
trial
judge
made
an
in-camera
inspection.
it
says
it
point
blank.
the
assistant
district
attorney
acknowledges,
this
is
in
february
of
1981,
there
is
a
written
statement.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
that
testimony
came
out
in
mr.
parker's
deposition.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
25.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
this
was
taken
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
the
first
state
habeas
proceeding
in
february
of
1981.
the
original
hearing
on
the
state
habeas
petition
was
january
30.
the
deposition
was
taken,
i
believe,
february
16.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
if
i...
he
says
evans'
statement
specifically.
i
think
that
is
virtually
the
only
way
you
can
read
what
a
statement,
office
evans
gave
his
statement
but
it
was
not
introduced
at
the
trial.
it
was
part--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
if
you
refer,
if
you
look
at
the
answer
given
by
mr.
parker
on
that
very
same
page...
mr.
stroup's
questioning
goes
on
further
to
talk
about
what
took
place
at
trial.
mr.
parker's
response
is
the
first
answer
on
that
page,
refers
to,
he
gave
his
statement,
it
was
not
introduced
at
trial,
it
was
part
of
that
matter
that
was
made
in-camera
inspection
by
the
judge
prior
to
trial.
that
to
me
clearly
identifies...
first
of
all
john
turner,
the
trial
counsel,
has
already
testified
he
knew
there
was
a
written
statement
of
somebody.
mr.
parker,
who
has
just
sat
there
and
said
that
that
written
statement
was
of
office
evans--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
very
good
question
that
we
do
not
know
the
answer--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
the
only
explanation
offered
by
counsel
was
that
counsel
did
not
understand
that
that
was
what
mr.
parker
was
telling
him.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
mr.
stroup,
i
believe,
testified
before
the
district
court
that
he
thought
the
answer
was
not
responsive
to
his
question,
and
therefore
he
repeated
his
question,
which
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
mr.
parker
told
him
that
it
was
a
statement.
whether
counsel
understood
it
or
not
may
be
a
different
inquiry.
the
point
being
that
this
is
not
something
that
the
state
has
hidden
away,
has
never
told
anybody
existed,
and
never
owned
up
to
having
in
its
possession.
and
in
fact
it
was
available,
could
have
been
obtained
in
1981
the
same
way
it
was
obtained
in
1987
through
the
open
records
act.
there
were
statutory
provisions,
there
was
case
law
allowing
access
to
this
type
of
information
once
the
conviction
became
final
in
the
state
of
georgia.
it
was
not
requested
at
that
time.
the
request--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
my
position
is
that
counsel
made
a
mistake,
that
that
constitutes
an
abuse
of
the
writ,
and
that
there
is
no
miscarriage
of
justice
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
question
of
mr.
mccleskey's
guilt
in
this
matter.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position
in
this
matter.
in
reviewing
the
issues
before
the
court,
again
it
is
important
to
look
at
what
happened
in
1981
and
what
happened
in
1987.
and
1987
is
the
time
that
counsel
brings
the
massiah
claim
to
the
federal
court
for
the
first
time,
after
having
raised
it
in
state
court,
omitted
it
from
the
first
federal
habeas
petition.
the
only
thing
counsel
knew
differently
in
1987
was
that
he
had
access
to
this
written
statement
of
offie
evans
that
he
says,
that
it
has
been
found
he
was
unaware
of
in
1981,
keeping
in
mind
nobody
has
found
that
that
statement
was
unavailable
to
him
in
1981,
but
simply
that
he
was
unaware
of
its
existence.
that
is
the
factual
finding,
which
is
i
think
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
amadeo
v.
zant,
in
which
in
amadeo
it
was
found
not
only
was
he
unaware
of
it,
but
it
was
simply
not
discoverable
under
any
means.
that
is
not
the
finding
in
this
court.
that
is
not
the
finding
that
we
have.
in
fact,
the
state--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no,
your
honor.
what
is
referred
to
by
the
petitioner
in
that
regard
is
a
letter
that
is
contained
in
the
file
that
came
after
mr.
parker's
deposition.
as
we
said,
mr.
parker's
deposition
was
taken,
he
makes
all
these
references.
the
discussion
is
had
concerning
the
investigative
file
made
available
to
defense
counsel
prior
to
trial.
it
was
agreed
a
copy
would
be
substituted
to
be
attached
to
the
deposition.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
information
there
that
perhaps
he
could
have
used
better,
used
differently,
something
along
those
lines.
that
was
the
purpose
stated
to
the
state
habeas
corpus
judge
for
requesting
the
file
in
the
first
place.
when
the
copy
was
sent
there
was
a
cover
letter
sent
with
the
copy
of
the
file.
that
is
what
counsel
refers
to.
the
cover
letter
is
sent
to
the
court
reporter
with
the
file.
the
cover
letter
does
say
here
is
the
complete
file
of
mr.
parker.
a
clear
reading
of
what
the
record
is
is
this
comes
on
the
very
heels
of
the
deposition
in
which
the
whole
discussion
takes
place
involving
the
file
shown
to
defense
counsel.
that
is,
whether
it's
an
inaccurate
use
of
terminology
is
simply
not
the
question.
the
question
is
looking
at
the
totality
of
what
happened,
it
is
clear
that
what
the
letter
is
referring
to
is
this
is
the
file
we
talked
about
in
the
deposition,
which
was
the
file
made
available
to
defense
counsel.
here
it
is.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
this
document,
and
there
was
also
a
portion
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
which
was
not
turned
over
to
counsel,
and
again
it
was
part
of
the
in-camera
inspection.
and
no
court
has
ever
found
a
brady
violation
by
the
failure
to
disclose
this
statement
prior
to
trial.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
and,
your
honor,--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
what
our
position
is
is
that
there
was
no
right
to
that
statement
prior
to
trial,
no
constitutional
right
to
the
statement
prior
to
trial.
once
the
trial
was
over
and
that
there
was
a
statement
here
saying
that
this,
there
is
testimony
that
this
statement
does
exist,
then
at
that
point
in
time
the
state
does
nothing
to
prevent
counsel
for
the
petitioner
from
obtaining
that
document.
absolutely
nothing
is
done
by
the
state
to
prevent
counsel
from
obtaining
it.
had
counsel
asked
at
the
time
of
the
deposition
of
mr.
parker
what
was
it
that
we
were
talking
about,
what
was
the
in-camera
inspection
material,
i
don't
know
what
the
response
would
have
been,
but
i
assume
that
something
would
have
been
said
to
the
effect
of
it
was
offie
evans'
statement
and
grand
jury
testimony.
that
wasn't
asked.
there
was
no
inquiry
of
mr.
parker
what
was
part
of
the
in-camera
inspection,
what
are
those
documents.
that
wasn't
what
counsel
was
even
looking
for
at
that
point
in
time.
when
it
came
up
to
the
time
in
1987,
counsel
made
a
request
under
the
georgia
open
records
act
from
the
atlanta
police
department,
i
might
point
out,
not
from
the
district
attorney's
office,
was
provided
with
the
statement,
and
then,
based
on
the
statement
alone,
filed
for
federal
habeas
corpus,
state
and
federal
habeas
corpus
actions,
raising
the
massiah
violation
at
that
point
in
time.
the
question
then
becomes,
i
think,
what
did
counsel
know
differently
in
1987
than
what
he
knew
in
1981.
the
only
different
thing
that
he
had
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
filed
raising
the
massiah
claim
is
this
written
statement
of
offie
evans.
we
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
statement
in
that
the
statement
of
offie
evans
does
not
tell
counsel
that
much
that
he
did
not
already
know.
we
already
knew
that
mr.
evans
was
in
the
cell
next
to
mr.
mccleskey,
that
there
were
conversations
between
the
two
of
them.
if
you
read
the
cross-examination
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
district
attorney
injects
a
lot
of
the
information.
the
district
attorney
makes
inquiry
of
the
petitioner,
didn't
someone
in
the
cell
next
to
you
tell
you
he
was
a
relative
of
ben
wright?
the
petitioner
responds
no,
that
never
happened.
didn't
you
tell
someone
something
about
having
your
face
made
up?
no,
i
never
said
that.
a
lot
of
this
inquiry
comes
out
in
the
cross-examination
of
the
petitioner,
who
ironically
enough
denies
ever
having
made
these
statements,
denies
even
remembering
offie
evans
being
in
the
cell
next
to
him,
and
knows
nothing
about--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
he
testified
both
at
trial
and
at
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
1981.
when
mr.
mccleskey
testified
he
denied
ever
having
been
present
at
the
store
at
all,
having
any
participation
in
the
trial,
in
the
crime
whatsoever,
denied
any
of
these
conversations
with
mr.
evans.
and
then
he
later
hedged
somewhat
and
said
well,
there
were
some
conversations
but
i
never
said
anything
incriminating,
and
certainly
don't
remember
any
of
this
that
you
are
talking
about
with
somebody
talking
about
a
relative
of
ben
wright's
or
something
along
those
lines.
the
most
that
the
statement
provides,
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearings
in
the
district
court
in
1987
the
concern
of
that
court
was
some
indication
that
there
were
two
meetings
with
mr.
evans.
that
mr.
evans
met
with
the
officials
once,
went
back,
and
then
met
with
them
again
to
give
his
statement,
and
perhaps
obtained
information
between
those
two
time
periods.
that
is
not
new
information
either.
mr.
evans
testified
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
he
met
with
two
detectives,
he
met
with
mr.
parker.
he
indicates
that
he
has
at
least
seen
somebody
with
either
the
police
department
or
the
district
attorney's
office
on
two
occasions,
again
giving
rise
to
the
question
of
what
took
place
in
between
these
two
times,
if
anything
took
place
in
between
these
two
times.
the
statement
itself
simply
is
a
more
detailed
explanation
of
what
counsel
already
knew,
with
some
very
minimal
additional
facts
that
we
submit
does
not
give
rise
to
this
great
new
burst
of
light
to
justify
raising
a
claim
in
1987
which
didn't
raise
in
1981.
it
simply
is
not--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
in
relation
to
counsel's
conduct
particularly,
there
are
several
different
areas
from
which
this
court
has
drawn
standards.
i
think
one
more
particularly

raising
claims
and
issues
of
which
through

diligence
the

ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
accurate.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
not
inexcusable
neglect
on
the
part
of
counsel,
was
the
terminology
utilized
by
the
district
court.
but
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
we
disagree.
we
do
not
find
that
counsel
engaged
in
a
thorough
investigation.
they
did
not
use
the
terminology
reasonably
competent
counsel.
that
was
not--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
think
this
court
can
certainly
examine
the
record
itself
based
upon
the
findings
made
of
the
court
below
and
determine
as
a
legal
matter
whether
the
reasonably
competent
standard
has
been
met.
we...
it
is
not
a
pure
factual
finding,
obviously.
it
would
be
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
similar
to
ineffective
assistance
challenges
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
certainly
could
be
examined
from
the
record
before
the
court.
the
court
certainly
has
the
option
of
remanding
for
consideration
under
a
different
standard,
if
the
court
feels
that
that
is
necessary.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
assume
the
court
is
referring
to
former
justice
powell's
committee
and
the
legislation
that
is
being
submitted
along
those
lines.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
will
have
an
impact
on
the
outcome
of
this
particular
case
under
the
factual
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
i
don't,
i
would
hesitate
to
suggest
that
the
court
either
wait
on
legislation,
because
we
do
have
a
case
that
is
ripe
for
adjudication
under
the
facts
that
we
have.
and
i
also
think
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
based
upon
the
existing
case
law
that
is
presently
pending,
presently
before
the
court
and
available
for
its
use.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
my
understanding.
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
individual
bills,
but
i
do,
i
believe
the
court
is
correct.
i
don't
recall
that
the
bills
would
address
the
precise
factual
situation
that
we
have
here,
certainly
not--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
am
not
certain
of
that
at
this
point.
petitioner
has
taken
great
issue
in
the
abuse
of
the
writ
question
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
resolution
of
certain
matters,
asserting
that
the
eleventh
circuit
has
ignored
factual
findings
by
the
district
court--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
its
reasons
are
quite
justifiable.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
one
basis
upon
which
this
decision
can
be
affirmed.
however--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--not
under
the
traditional
meaning
of
deliberate
withholding
as
set
forth
in
sanders.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
twofold
aspect
in
this
particular
case.
the
withholding,
whether
deliberate
or
otherwise,
of
the
claim
is
a
facet
of
the
abuse
of
the
writ
in
this
case.
that
is
that
there
was
a
claim,
the
legal
issue
was
known,
for
whatever
reasons
it
was
not
presented
in
the
first
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
is
certainly
the
first
facet
of
abuse--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--this
particular
factual
matter.
certainly
there
was
information
there
sufficient
for
counsel
to
raise
it
in
the
first
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
he
felt
he
had
enough
to
raise
it
then.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
part
of
our
claim.
the
second
aspect
then
goes
to
would
be
why
counsel
did
not
present
it.
and
our
position
is
because
the
investigation
conducted
by
counsel
in
1981
was
not
adequate,
was
not
reasonable
under
what
term...
whatever
terminology
you
wish
to
use
to
come
up
to
a
standard
to
excuse
the
abuse.
in
other
words,
counsel's
conduct
amounted
to
inexcusable
neglect
in
failing
to
obtain
the
information
necessary
to
present
a
massiah
claim.
we
are
not
standing
here
and
going
to
tell
the
court
that
he
necessarily
would
have
found
ulysses
worthy
in
1981.
i
can't
tell
the
court
that,
but
neither
can
the
petitioner
say
he
would
not
have
found
ulysses
worthy
in
1981.
the
inquiries
necessary--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
think
that
what
is
pertinent
here
is
to
examine
what
counsel
did
not
do
in
1981.
counsel
says
he
talked
to
some
members,
some
officials
at
the
jail.
i
believe
two
or
three
was
the
wording
used.
now
whether
counsel
got
around
to
mr.
worthy
is
not
really
the
pertinent
question.
the
pertinent
question
is
what
was
there
that
could
have
been
done
in
1981--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i
am
not,
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
counsel
was
ineffective
under
a
sixth
amendment
standard,
but
certainly
i
think
counsel
lacked
and
failed
in,
to
exercising
reasonable
diligence
in
finding
the
information
present
here.
the
key
fact
that
no
one
did
in
1981
that
was
done
in
1987--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
was
one
of
the
bases
for
their
decision.
they
did
go
on
to
find
fault
with
the
investigation
conducted
by
counsel
and
note
the
numerous
things
counsel
did
not
do
in
1981
in
the
investigation
in
making
this
decision
not
to
pursue
the
claim.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
again,
i
think
that
is--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
is
a
part
of
their
decision.
they
actually
make
it--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--they
make
a
three-pronged
analysis,
your
honor.
first
of
all
they
disagree
and
conclude
that
there
was
intentional
abandonment.
the
court
then
concludes
that
counsel
did
not
make
a
sufficient
investigation
so
as
to
excuse
otherwise
abuse
of
conduct.
and
then
in
any
event
finds
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
not
require
consideration
of
the
claim
by
finding
that
the
claim
would
be
harmless
error
under
the
prevailing
standards.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
in
reading
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
while
they
use
the
word
thorough
investigation,
it
appears
that
they
are
examining
the
question
of
what
was
reasonable
for
counsel
to
do.
they
don't
articulate
it
in
that
fashion,
i
will
acknowledge
to
the
court.
the
words
they
use
are
thorough
investigation.
i
don't
think
that
is
imposing
some
sort
of
strict
liability
standard,
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
amicus
curiae.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
read
particularly
the
footnote
in
that
opinion
where
they
are
talking
about
the
failure
to
do
various
things,
it
is
not
just
the
failure
to
discover
key
facts,
but
it
is
the
failure
to
pursue
other
avenues
that
were
available
in
1981.
i
think
most
particularly,
one
of
the
things
noted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
we
have
noted,
in
1981
the
jail
records
were
available
to
show
why
offie
evans
was
in
the
fulton
county
jail
to
begin
with,
why
he
might
have,
where
he
was
put
in
the
fulton
county
jail.
you
could
have
seen
whether
he
had
been
moved--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
we
don't
know
that,
because
those
records--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--not
on
the
jail
records
themselves
necessarily.
his
name
might
have
been
reflected
on
there.
the
problem
we
have
in
1987
is
that
during
the
normal
course
of,
normal
retention
schedules
of
the
fulton
county
departments,
obviously
they
do
not
keep
these
records
forever,
those
records
don't
exist
anymore.
they
did
exist
in
1981.
i
believe
the
information,
or
part
of
them
were
destroyed
in
june
of
1981
and
some
others
were
destroyed
in
1986.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
worthy
was
found
later
through
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
detectives
at
the
federal
habeas
corpus
evidentiary
hearing.
again,
and
this
is
another
aspect
which
we
submit
counsel
should
have
pursued.
when
mr.
evans
testified
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
he
mentioned
two
detectives
by
name,
detective
dorsey,
detective
harris.
detective
harris
was
not
talked
to
by
counsel
at
that
time,
was
not
called
as
a
witness,
was
not
offered
to
testify
to
anything.
when
detective
harris
was
called
to
testify
in
1987,
detective
harris
took
the
witness
stand,
discussed
the
fact
that
they
went
to
the
jail
to
talk
to
mr.
evans,
which
seems
a
logical
conclusion
if
you
have
an
inmate
in
a
jail
with
information.
he
was
asked
where
it
took
place.
he
said
it
took
place
in
captain
worthy's
office.
that
is
where
the
name
ulysses
worthy
comes
from,
is
from
detective
harris
when
asked,
telling
them
exactly
where
this
conversation
occurred,
in
whose
office
it
took
place.
from
that
the
petitioner
went
and
subpoenaed
mr.
worthy
to
come
in
and
testify
as
to
his
knowledge
of
the
events
that
took
place.
and
our
position
based
upon
this
is
that
if
they
had
talked
to
detective
harris
he
very
well
could
have
mentioned
ulysses
worthy's
name.
whether
counsel
would
have
gone
on
to
interview
ulysses
worthy
is
not
the
state's
burden,
it's
the
petitioner's
burden
to
prove
that
he
would
not
have
known
to
go
ahead
and
take
that
further
step.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
no...
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
these
factors
are
not
linked
to
the
21-page
statement.
the
21-page
statement
was
apparently
what
caused
petitioner
to
re-raise
the
massiah
claim
in
the
first
place,
but
that
doesn't
get
you
to
the
point
of
finding
ulysses
worthy.
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
if
i
may
briefly
comment
on
the
harmless
error
question
as
it
was
raised
and
discussed
by
the
petitioner,
we
would
submit
first
of
all
that
a
review
of
this
record
shows
that
what
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
was
referred
back
to
its
original
en
banc
opinion
in
reviewing
mr.
mccleskey's
case
on
the
first
federal
habeas
corpus
action,
in
which
they
investigated
and
reviewed
thoroughly
the
testimony
of
offie
evans
and
its
impact
on
the
trial.
the
eleventh
circuit
acknowledged
the
difference
in
the
standards
that
it
was
concerned
with.
the
first
trial
we
are
talking
about
united
states
v.
bagley,
the
second
trial
chapman
v.
california
harmless
error.
but
the
court
went
on
in
looking
at
its
own
prior
findings,
concluded
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
the
testimony
of
offie
evans,
even
if
improperly
admitted,
and
we
certainly
do
not
concede
that
it
was
improperly
admitted
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
would
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
focusing
on
all
of
the
factors
at
trial,
including
the
fact
that
the
evidence
showed
that
the
fatal
shots
were
fired
from
a.38
caliber
rossi,
that
the
evidence
showed
clearly
two
eyewitnesses,
mr.
mccleskey's
own
statements
to
the
police,
and
the
testimony
of
ben
wright,
that
mr.
mccleskey
came
in
the
front
door
of
the
store
while
the
other
perpetrators
came
in
the
back
door
of
the
store,
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
at
the
crime
that
the
shots
were
fired
from
the
front
of
the
store,
the
testimony
of
the
two
eyewitnesses
in
the
front
of
the
store
who
saw
mr.
mccleskey
with
a
silver
gun
in
his
hand,
the
testimony
of
the
witness
at
the
front
of
the
store
outside
who
saw
a
man
running
out
with
a
gun
with
white
handles,
the
testimony
of
witnesses
from
a
prior
armed
robbery
positively
identifying
mr.
mccleskey
as
the
individual
who
committed
that
robbery
and
stole
during
the
course
of
that
robbery
a.38
caliber
nickel-plated
brazilian-made
revolver,
and
a
ross
is
a
brazilian-made
revolver.
the
testimony
does,
mary
jenkins
places
the
weapon
in
hands
of
mr.
wright
and
mr.
mccleskey,
stating
that
well,
the
last
time
she
had
seen
ben
wright
with
it
had
been
over
a
week
ago,
but
warren
mccleskey
did
have
the
silver
revolver.
and
then
mr.
wright
himself
also
places
the
weapon
in
mr.
mccleskey's
hands.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
our
submission
of
course
is
they
did
not
violate
the
massiah
rule
in
this
case.
we
have
disputed
the
fact--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
is
also
our
position.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor.
all
at
this
time
i
am
talking
about
is
the
harmless
error
question.
the
prosecution
also
only
used
mr.
evans'
testimony
in
rebuttal,
after
mr.
mccleskey
took
the
stand
and
repudiated
his
own
prior
statements.
mr.
mccleskey
had
given
two
statements
to
police
saying
he
was
there,
he
participated
in
the
armed
robbery...
excuse
me,
one
statement
where
he
says
he
was
in
the
front
of
the
store
at
the
shot,
the
time
the
shots
were
fired,
one
more
detailed
statement
saying
i
was
there,
i
went
in
the
front
of
the
store,
i
participated
in
the
armed
robbery,
but
i
hid
under
a
sofa
or
a
bed
at
the
time
the
shots
were
fired
and
i
didn't
do
that.
when
he
took
the
stand
at
trial,
mr.
mccleskey
said
i
was
not
there
at
all.
i
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
i
was
over
at
my
sister's.
i
was
over
at
some
friend's,
establishing
an
alibi
defense.
it
was
after
that
testimony
that
the
prosecution
brought
offie
evans
in
to
come
in
to
impeach
mr.
mccleskey's
own
testimony.
in
fact
the
trial
court
at
that
point
make,
gives
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
this
testimony
coming
in
after
the
defense
has
closed
is
being
offered
for
impeachment
purposes
only.
that
is
when
offie
evans
is
brought
in
to
testify
and
to
make
his
statement
that
no,
mr.
mccleskey
told
me
that
he
actually
was
there,
he
participated
in
the
crime,
and
he
was
the
trigger
man
to
this
case.
under
the
facts
as
we
are
looking
at
the
entire
proceedings
we
would
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
first
of
all,
there
was
an
abuse
of
the
writ
in
this
case
based
upon
counsel's
lack
of
reasonable
diligence,
based
upon
counsel's
choosing
to
abandon
the
claim.
and
we
would
thank
the
court
for
its
consideration
and
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion.
thank
you.
