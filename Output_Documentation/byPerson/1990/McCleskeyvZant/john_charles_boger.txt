mr.
john
charles
boger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
state
misconduct
in
a
criminal
trial,
the
massiah
violation,
about
how
that
conduct
was
hidden
by
certain
state
police
officers
and
other
officials
for
9
years,
and
about
how
both
the
underlying
misconduct
and
the
conspiracy
that
hid
it
subsequently
came
to
light.
the
case
presents
two
legal
issues.
the
first
is
whether
petitioner
should
now
be
entitled
to
assert
that
massiah
violation
on
a
second
federal
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
or
whether
on
the
contrary
he
should
be
held
to
have
used
the
writ.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
state's
use
of
the
fruits
of
its
misconduct,
a
confession
that
was
obtained
from
mr.
mccleskey
in
the
cell,
was
somehow
harmless
error
at
both
the
guilt
and
the
penalty
phases
of
mr.
mccleskey's
trial.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
believe
that
is
right,
your
honor.
as
i
recall,
one
of
the
judges
on
this
circuit
questioned
whether
a
massiah
violation
was
possible
absent
a
payment
of
money
between
the
informant
and
the
police.
and
so
that
issue
at
least,
i
know,
was
flagged.
let
me
address
the
issue
of
abuse
first.
in
amadeo
v.
zant,
decided
by
this
court
two
terms
ago,
the
court
was
presented
with
another
case
in
which
intentional
state
misconduct,
there
a
jury
discrimination
claim,
came
to
light
while
amadeo's
case
was
still
on
direct
appeal.
for
that
reason
the
issue
of
whether
amadeo
could
present
that
evidence
in
a
federal
application
was
fought
out
in
the
context
of
procedural
default.
but
in
resolving
the
issue
in
amadeo,
the
court
undertook
an
analysis
that
drove
on
doctrine
it
had
long
employed
in
the
area
of
abuse
law.
the
court
indicated
that
amadeo
could
excuse
his
failure
to
raise
the
claim
earlier
if
he
could
demonstrate
three
things.
first
that
some
objective
factor
external
to
the
defense,
some
interference
by
state
officials,
had
impeded
or
impaired
mr.
amadeo's
ability
to
identify
and
prosecute
that
claim.
second,
that
the
violation
was
not
reasonably
discoverable
independently
of
state
concealment.
and
third,
that
the
state
concealment
itself,
and
not
some
other
tactical
consideration
of
counsel,
had
led
amadeo
to
bypass
the
claim.
now
in
the
case
before
the
court
this
morning
the
district
judge,
owen
forrester,
necessarily
found
himself
confronting
questions
very
similar
to
those
addressed
in
amadeo.
and
after
an
extensive
hearing
of
almost
a
day's
length
he
made
fact
findings
on
those
questions.
he
found
first
that
atlanta
police
officers
had
not
only
violated
massiah,
but
had
actively
concealed
that
violation.
they
had,
as
he
put
it
at
one
point,
lied
and
lied
well
in
a
complicated
conspiracy.
he
also
found
that
the
evidence
which
would
have
proven
this
massiah
violation
was
not
reasonably
discoverable
by
counsel.
and
finally
he
found
that
petitioner's
deliberate
abandonment
of
the
massiah
claim
after
state
proceedings
was
prompted
not
by
any
independent
tactical
considerations,
but
solely
because
of
counsel's
inability
to
discover
the
underlying
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim,
evidence
that
state
officials
were
in
fact
actively
concealing
from
him.
having
made
these
specific
findings,
the
district
court
concluded
that
petitioner
was
not
guilty
of
inexcusable
neglect...
there
was
an
excuse...
or
of
deliberate
abandonment,
since
the
abandonment
was
not
fully
knowing
of
the
premises.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
he
actually--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--he
actually
appeared,
your
honor,
as
a
witness
in
the
state
habeas
proceedings,
and
he
was
asked
a
long
series
of
questions
which
i
refer
to
in
footnote
10
of
my
brief.
he
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
special
reason
he
was
put
in
the
cell
next
to
mccleskey.
he
was
asked
about
his
relationships
with
the
police
officers.
he
was
asked
about
what
was
the
point
of
his
being
put
there.
he
gave
answers
that
were
totally
nonresponsive
on
the
issues
of
a
possible
massiah
violation.
so
had
we
gone
to
the
district
judge
and
said
we
want
more
deposition
of
offie
evans,
the
judge
would
have
said,
what
have
you
done.
and
we
would
have
said
we
put
him
under
oath.
and
the
judge
would
have
asked,
well,
what
did
you
get,
and
the
answer
really
was
nothing,
no
evidence
of
a
massiah
violation.
mr.
john
charles
boger
he
did
indicate
that
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
police
officials,
and
he
indicated
that
one
of
the
officers
said
he
would
speak
a
word
for
mccleskey,
for
evans
in
exchange
for
his
testimony.
that
became
the
basis
for
our
giglio
claim,
which
we
did
pursue
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
but
when
pressed
about
whether
there
was
any
special
reason
he
was
put
in
the
cell
next
to
mccleskey,
asked
about
whether
he
had
been
an
informant
on
subsequent
occasions
or
otherwise
worked
with
the
police
officers
as
an
informant,
his
answer
didn't
reveal
anything
about
this
relationship.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
don't
have
evidence
about
which
part
of
this
is
his
own
invention
and
which
part
comes
from
the
police.
but
it
is
plain
that
he
is
a
man
on
a
mission,
that
he
comes
in
not
simply
to
hear
what
he
could
hear,
but
with
a
story.
i
was
the
uncle
of
a
codefendant.
i
would
have
been
in
on
this
robbery.
please
tell
me
where
are
the
guns,
because
the
guns
hadn't
been
located
by
the
police.
tell
me
where,
who
did
the
shooting.
and
moreover,
evidence
we
point
to
to
link
the
police,
he
says
i
understand
you,
that
you're
telling
the
police
in
private
conversations
in
the
police
station
that
ben
wright
did
the
shooting.
that
evidence,
to
our
knowledge,
was
not
known
to
the
public,
and
we
think
that
it
could
come
only
from
the
police
officers
themselves.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
your
honor.
we
didn't
have
evans'
21-page
statement
until
june
of
1987.
there
are
really
two--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--the
statement
makes
quite
clear
that
he
is
talking
about
this
evidence
that,
you're
telling
the
police
something
that
i
have
heard
that
puts
the
crime
on
ben
wright.
that
evidence
didn't
come
out
at
trial.
it
wouldn't
suggest
of
a
massiah
violation.
and
furthermore,
the
detail
that,
in
which
he
elaborated
in
the
21-page
statement,
his
course
of
questioning
was
quite
different
than
what
we
learned
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
it
really
sounded
like
mccleskey
himself
had
volunteered
most
of
this
information.
what
we
see
in
the
21-page
statement
is
an
active,
aggressive
questioner.
as
the
district
judge
found,
the
district
judge
on
page
84
of
the
joint
appendix
said
that
the
21-page
statement
is
strong
evidence
of
an
ab
initio
relationship
between
evans
and
the
police.
so
there
are
really
two
prongs
to
our
massiah
violation
once
it
unfolded,
and
one
was
the
statement,
and
one
was
ulysses
worthy's
testimony.
now
the
court
of
appeals
dismisses
the
fact
finding
about
the
21-page
statement.
it
says
it
really
wasn't
anything
except
perhaps
a
prod
to
further
inquiry.
but
the
district
judge
made
a
contrary
fact
finding,
and
it
was
not
in
our
judgment
reasonably,
or
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
john
charles
boger
there
was
a
series
of
requests,
your
honor,
made
for
that
statement
beginning
prior
to
the
trial.
there
was
actually
a
motion
filed
by
trial
counsel--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--that
led
to
the
in
camera
hearing.
that
was
renewed,
the
request
for
a
statement,
during
colloquy
on
the
examination
of
warren
mccleskey,
as
the
prosecutor
began
to
ask
questions
that
appeared
to
set
the
foundation
for
an
inconsistent
statement.
mr.
john
charles
boger
indeed.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
agree,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
a
deposition
was
held
of
the
prosecutor,
and
part
of
the
deposition
was
an
agreement
which
was
incorporated
in
the
letter
which
was
included
in
the
joint
appendix
in
which
an
assistant
attorney
general,
nicholas
dumich,
says
i
am
turning
over
the
complete
prosecutor's
file
in
this
case.
mr.
john
charles
boger
but
we
had
no
knowledge
that
a
written
statement
existed.
indeed
everything--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--no,
your
honor.
we
had
an
indication
that
there
were
two
things
that
were
being
withheld.
one
was
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
other
one
was
not
identified.
indeed--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
that...
let
me
get
the
chronology--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--let
me
get
the
chronology
straight
on
that,
justice
scalia.
there
had
been
a
statement
during
the
trial
by
the
judge
in
the
colloquy,
i
don't
know
that
we
are
talking
about
any
written
statement.
on
appeal
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
said
the
evidence
which
you
are
seeking
came
out
in
its
entirety
through
the
testimony
of
office
evans.
we
then
got
an
agreement
to
get
the
entire
prosecutor's
file.
during
the
state
habeas
proceedings
the
defense
counsel
said,
i
had
an
agreement
with
the
prosecutor.
he
gave
me
all
of
the
witness
statements
prior
to
the
time
each
witness
testified.
that
is
the
backdrop
during
which...
when
mr.
stroup
asked
the
prosecutor
about
the
testimony
of
evans,
the
prosecutor
makes
the
remark
in
passing
that
you
refer
to.
mr.
stroup
testified
he
had
really
misapprehended--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
prosecutor's
statement.
mr.
john
charles
boger
the
suggestion
of
the
judge
as
he
goes
on
is
i
am
not
saying
it
is
necessarily
a
written
statement.
mr.
john
charles
boger
it
could
be
a
written
transcription
of
an
oral
statement.
what
is
clear
from
the
record,
your
honors,
is
that
both
the
trial
judge
in
the
state
habeas
counsel,
and,
in
reviewing
the
matter,
the
federal
district
judge,
found
that
it
was
not
at
all
clear
that
a
written
statement
existed.
indeed
the
trial
attorney
as
late
as
the
state
habeas
proceedings
said,
i
think
i
got
all
of
the
written
statements
of
the
witnesses.
i
had
an
agreement
about
that
with
the...
mr.
stroup
actually
testified
in
state
habeas
proceedings
that
he
had
concluded
that
the
other
matter
being
held
in
camera
was
some
hair
sample
reports.
there
were
other
issues
that
were
being
pursued
and
he
was
not
getting
response
on
that
issue.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
record
that
makes
it
clear
that
there
was
a
written
statement.
if
there
was
we
would
have
turned
to
it
immediately.
indeed
let
me
ask
this
question
of
the
court
in
this
sense,
rhetorically.
the
prosecutor
turned
over
every
other
document
in
this
case.
is
there
the
slightest
doubt
why
he
held
back
this
one
piece
of
information?
is
there
the
slightest
doubt
whether
the
state's
attorney
general,
when
we
asked
for
all
the
documents,
should
have
turned
it
over?
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
think
the
reason
it
was
held
back
is
clear.
it
was
a
smoking
gun.
as
the
district
court
found,
it
did
point
very
strongly
toward
an
ab
initio
relationship.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
know
that
the
prosecutor
had
this
statement.
we,
during
the
federal
habeas
proceedings
we
discovered
that
he
had
several
things
he
called
a
file.
he
said
i
have
got
my
file
in
this
case,
i
have
got
my
private
file,
and
indeed
there
was
a
distinction
made
there
that
we
had
never
been
aware
of.
but
he
never
suggested
that
he
didn't
know
about
this
statement,
the
prosecutor.
indeed,
he
was
present
when
this
statement
was
taken
in
august
of
1978.
if
he
was
initially
correct
in
simply
handing
it
over
in
camera,
he
was
certainly
in
error
in
failing
to
correct
the
record
when
the
judge
said,
i
don't
know
we
are
talking
about
any
written
statement,
or
when
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
the
evidence
that
you
have
sought
came
out
in
its
entirety
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
evans,
because
that
didn't
happen.
and
when
we
got
and
relied
upon
the
statement
of
rich,
nicholas
dumich
that
we
had
gotten
the
entire
prosecutor's
file
in
the
case,
the
district
judge
ultimately
held
that
was
not
inexcusable.
let
me
proceed
though
to
talk
about
how
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
this
issue.
when
it
came
to
the
questions
that
the
district
judge
had
found
no
abuse
on,
no
deliberate
abandonment,
it
began
its
reanalysis
as
if
the
state's
active
concealment
and
its
misconduct
were
simply
irrelevant,
and
as
if
the
fact
findings
of
the
district
judge
had
never
been
made.
on
both
counts,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
violated
settled
law.
when
the
state's
own
conduct
in
litigation
is
blameless,
as
in
the
wong
doo
case
or
the
salinger
case,
it
is
of
course
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
focus
its
attention
exclusively
on
whether
the
newly
available
evidence
was
available
earlier,
and
whether
counsel's
steps
to
find
it
were
reasonable.
but
when,
as
in
price
v.
johnston,
there
is
a
specter
of
state
concealment,
then
that
misconduct
must
be
factored
into
the
judicial
inquiry
on
the
question
of
abuse.
and
it
can
suffice,
that
state
concealment,
to
excuse
petitioner's
failure
to
assert
the
claim.
that
is
what
in
the
procedural
default
context
amadeo
stands
for.
the
court
of
appeals
totally
overlooked,
in
short,
the
effect
of
the
state's
concealment
here
as
it
made
its
analysis.
but
the
state
actions
plainly
impeded
and
impaired
counsel's
investigation.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
didn't
deal
with
that
issue.
the
court
made
a
second
error
as
well.
it
purported
to
determine
independently
that
counsel
for
petitioner
could
have
discovered
evidence
of
the
massiah
violation,
specifically
ulysses
worthy,
despite
any
state
concealment.
yet
judge
forrester,
who
heard
all
of
the
evidence,
made
a
fact
finding
directly
to
the
contrary.
there
is
no
showing,
he
says,
of
any
reason
that
petitioner
or
his
counsel
should
have
known
to
interview
worthy
directly.
faced
with
this
finding,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
wasn't
free
to
substitute
its
own
view
of
the
facts
unless
the
finding
was
clearly
erroneous.
but
judge
forrester
had
seen
for
himself
that
ulysses
worthy
was
tied
to
this
case
by
a
single
thread.
it
turned
out
that
it
was
in
his
office
where
the
21-page
statement
had
been
taken
by
the
officers,
a
statement
which
i
have
noted
we
didn't
realize
existed,
and
which
was
never
turned
over
despite
numerous
requests
for
it.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
disagree,
your
honor,
and
amadeo
underlines
the
point.
the
question
there
was
whether
the
incriminating
jury
memorandum
was
reasonably
discoverable,
whether
it
was
likely
to
have
been
discovered
by
counsel
who
went
on
a
search
for
it.
that
was
held
by
this
court
unanimously
to
be
a
fact
finding.
what
it
really
asked
to
do,
and
judge
forrester
was
particularly
well
suited
to
make
this
determination,
is
to
look
at
the
overall
state
of
the
record,
of
the
evidence
that
is
already
available,
look
at
who
the
witnesses
might
be
that
would
lead
to
other
evidence,
and
make
a
judgment
about
whether
reasonable
counsel
should
have
followed
those
leads.
now
what
was
particularly
unique
about
forrester's
opportunity
is
that
he
not
only
saw
individual
witnesses
and
passed
on
their
credibility;
in
a
sense
the
entire
conspiracy
came
into
his
courtroom.
one
by
one
the
state
police
officers
who
were
responsible
for
these
actions
appeared
before
him
under
oath,
and
he
watched
as
we,
as
the
state
questioned
these
officers
about
the
massiah
violation.
and
he
watched
as
they
built,
brick
by
brick,
a
stone
wall
against
inquiry.
mr.
john
charles
boger
your
honor,
we
would
have
had
no
hearing
in
federal
court
if
we
had
carried
that
claim
forward.
i
have
done
capital
cases
for
15
years,
primarily
in
georgia,
and
if
we
had
come
in
and
said
we
want
a
hearing
on
a
massiah
claim,
and
judge
forrester
had
asked
well,
what
did
you
do
in
the
state
habeas
court.
you
said
well,
we
put
on
the
purported
informant.
we
put
on
the
prosecutor,
who
says
there
is
no
informant
relationship,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
if
we
had
gotten,
if
we
had
kept
the
claim
in
the
case,
had
gotten
no
further
evidence,
had
gotten
all
the
way
through
an
initial
federal
appeal
and
the
evidence
had
come
to
light,
in
a
sense
we
would
be
in
the
same
position
we
are
in
now.
mr.
john
charles
boger
but
the
reason
we
made
the
decision
not
to
pursue
the
claim
is
that
we
found
after
a
serious
inquiry,
including
putting
under
oath
the
responsible
state
official,
the
prosecutor,
whom
this
court
has
held
is
charged
with
knowledge
of
everything
that
his
police
officers
do,
and
that
prosecutor
said
there
is
nothing
there.
the
real
question
for
this
court
on
that
point
is
whether
it
wants
to
fashion
a
new
rule
that
says
to
defense
counsel
you
must
pursue
every
conceivable
plane,
past
contrary
evidence,
at
all
stages
of
federal
habeas
proceedings,
on
pain
of
loss
of
the
claim.
if
we
had
gone
and
gotten
20
depositions
of
jailers
in
the
fulton
county
jail
it
would
have
been
error--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i
think
the
inquiry
that
you
outlined
in
amadeo
is
adequate.
you
do
ask,
was
counsel's
investigation
adequate.
was
it
checked
at
all
by
state
concealment,
the
failure
of
the
state
to
come
forward.
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
you
excuse
the
failure
to
carry
the
claim
forward.
but
if
either
the
state
concealment
wasn't
the
explanation
for
your
failure
to
discover
the
evidence,
or
if
the
investigation
wasn't
adequate
and
reasonable,
then
at
that
point,
of
course,
the
court
is
free
to
brand
the
claim
as
barred.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
do
want
to
get
to
the
question
of
harmless
error,
your
honor.
this,
the
court
of
appeals
disregarded
subsidiary
fact
findings
on
the
question
of
harmless
error
that
were
made
by
the
district
court.
but
before
i
get
to
that
rule
52
problem,
the
state's
case
was
threefold.
the
state
had
the
testimony
of
a
codefendant,
one
ben
wright,
who
was
the
other
most
likely
shooter,
saying
gratuitously,
warren
told
me
that
he
did
the
shooting.
that
was
highly
suspect.
the
jury
was
skeptical
of
it,
and
the
judge
said
it
was
obviously
self-serving.
then
there
was
this
conflicting
evidence
about
who
was
carrying
the
weapon.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
state's
witnesses
couldn't
all
agree.
two
of
the
furniture
store
employees
said
the
man
who
came
in
the
front
of
the
store
carried
the
silver
pistol.
but
another
one
of
the
employees
said
the
man
who
came
in
the
back
of
the
store
carried
what
he
called
the
chrome
pistol.
and
someone
who
was
outside
said
i
saw
someone
come
running
out
the
front
with
the
pearl-handled
pistol.
so
we
have
got
a
total
confusion
of
testimony
on
who
had
what
gun.
now
mary
jenkins
purported
to
clear
that
out.
she
said
warren
mccleskey
was
carrying
the.38.
but
she
was
the
girlfriend
of
ben
wright.
and
on
cross-examination
when
she
was
asked,
she
was
forced
to
confront
testimony
that
when
she
was
arrested
she
told
the
police,
my
man
ben
carried
the.38,
mccleskey
totes
a.45.
so
the
state's
witnesses
were
a
cacophony
of
disagreement
on
who
carried
that
weapon.
what
is
left
then?
you
have
got
the
self-serving
statement
of
ben
wright,
you
have
got
the
other
evidence.
the
key
to
this
case
was
the
confession
that
offie
evans
came
forward
and
said
ben
wright
had
given
in
the
jail.
he
said
that
mccleskey
had
not
only
admitted
the
shooting
but
he
had
bragged
about
it.
he
said
he
would
have
killed
a
dozen
of
them--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i'm
sorry,
warren
mccleskey.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
warren
mccleskey,
according
to
evans,
had
said
i
did
the
shooting,
and
i
would
have
killed
a
dozen
officers.
this
court
has
written,
i
think
appropriately,
that
confessions
are
rarely
harmless
error
in
any
case,
but
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
other
evidence
is
so
weak
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
profoundly
in
error
to
suggest
that
it
would
have
made
no
difference
at
guilt
or
at
penalty.
think
with
me
for
a
moment
about
the
penalty
consequences.
this
court
wrote
in
satterwhite
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
assess
harmlessness
in
the
context
of
sentencing
because
the
jury's
discretion
is
so
broad.
what
do
we
have
on
the
issue
of
harmlessness
at
penalty?
we
have
got
a
picture
on
the
one
hand
of
confusion
without
evans'
testimony,
without
mccleskey's
confession,
or
with
mccleskey's
confession
we
have
a
picture
of
a
man
who
said
i
did
it,
i
would
have
killed
a
dozen
officers.
i
don't
think
it
takes
any
great
imagination
to
suggest
that
that
would
have
contributed
to
a
jury's
judgment
on
the
issue
of
penalty.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no.
mccleskey--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--had
confessed
it
when
he
was
picked
up
by
the
police
that
he
was
present
at
the
robbery
scene,
but
said,
i
did
not
do
the
shooting.
the
only
other
confession
they
had
was
ben
wright's.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
john
charles
boger
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
answers
to
three
questions
posed
by
different
justices.
i
will
try
to
be
brief.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
whether
there
was
any
link
between
the
21-page
statement
and
worthy.
the
answer
is
yes.
harris
only
gave
the
name
of
worthy
when
asked,
where
did
you
take
the
21-page
statement.
until
you
had
the
statement
you
had
no
predicate
to
ask
that
question,
and
therefore
there
was
no
reason
to
link
worthy
to
the
case.
justice
scalia,
you
questioned
about
whether
the
witness
statement
was
referred
to
as
one
of
the
matters
that
was
heard,
reviewed
in-camera,
and
i
gave
some
answer
to
that.
as
i
thought
about
it
when
i
sat
down,
96
witnesses
were
endorsed
on
the
indictment
on
this
case,
but
only
a
dozen
or
so
testified
at
trial.
the
testimony
of
john
turner,
the
defense
counsel,
in
state
habeas
proceedings
is
as
follows.
i
entered
into
agreement
with
the
prosecutor
whereby
he
had
agreed
to
give
me
copies
of
the
statements
prior
to
the
witnesses'
testimony,
meaning
the
witnesses
who
testified,
and
i
think
he
gave
them
to
me,
all
that
first
day,
that
monday.
so
i
think
that
i
knew
what
would
have
been
the
actual
statements
for
everybody
who
testified.
see,
he
is
operating
on
the
assumption
that
wherever,
whether
there
might
have
been
another
witness
statement
of
those
85
witnesses
who
didn't
testify,
he
had
gotten
the
statements
of
witnesses
like
offie
evans.
mr.
john
charles
boger
evans
did
testify,
your
honor.
mr.
john
charles
boger
not
the
first
day.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
what
he
means,
i
believe,
your
honor,
the
trial
began
on
a
monday
and
there
is
some,
it
is
on
page
88
of
the
state
habeas
transcript.
but
the
trial
began...
not
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
but
the
state
habeas
transcript.
he
says
the
first
day
of
trial
i
got
all
of
the
witness
statements,
so
i
felt
i
was
well
prepared.
in
fact
he
didn't
get
evans'
written
statement.
finally,
let
me
ask,
or
answer
justice
o'connor.
you
raised
a
question
about
whether
the
reasonably
effective
counsel
standard
was
at
all--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i
don't
think
we
need
to
make
affirmative
lies
at
every
point.
we
do,
of
course,
have
the
underlying
lies
and
misstatements
of
detective
dorsey.
dorsey
had
committed
a
massiah
violation,
he
apparently
had
misinformed
the
prosecutor.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that
is
right,
but
of
course
he
misinforms
the
prosecutor,
who
then
says
under
oath
in
the
state
habeas
proceedings
there
was
no
informant
relationship.
he
is
speaking
for
the
state
as
a
whole,
as
justice
stevens
has
written,
under
the
sixth
amendment.
when
the
state
speaks
on
a
question
like
that
it
has
to
answer
for
its
errant
police
officers
as
well
as
for
its
core
prosecutors.
giglio
held
the
same
thing.
our
suggestion,
our
submission,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
enough
state
concealment
here,
enough
misrepresentations
and
half-truths
and
partial
answers,
that
on
an
equitable
matter
of
abuse
of
the
writ
we
should
not
have
our
client
go
to
the
electric
chair
because
we
couldn't
ferret
through
this
game
of
20
questions
that
was
being
played
by
the
state.
they
had
the
statement,
they
knew
it,
they
knew
it
bore
on
the
massiah
violation,
and
they
didn't
turn
it
over.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
was
simply
going
to
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
standards.
on
page
84
of
the
joint
appendix,
when
the
district
judge
addresses
the
question
of
whether
counsel's
conduct
was
inexcusable,
he
recites
a
standard
drawn
from
a
then-current
case,
the
moore
case,
and
says
that
the
defendant
is
chargeable
with
counsel's
actual
awareness
and
with
the
knowledge
that
would
have
been
possessed
by
reasonably
competent
counsel.
so
having
addressed
that
matter,
he
finds
no
inexcusable
neglect.
i
am
sorry,
justice--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
legislation
may
have
died
in
committee
and
would
have
to
be
resuscitated
beginning
in
january.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no,
we
don't.
thank
you.
