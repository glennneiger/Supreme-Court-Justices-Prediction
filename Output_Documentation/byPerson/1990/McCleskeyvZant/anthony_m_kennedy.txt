this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
which
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
requires
us
to
explain
in
considerable
detail
what
the
courts
have
called
the
doctrine
of
abuse
of
the
writ.
that
doctrine
defines
the
circumstances
in
which
federal
courts
decline
to
entertain
a
claim
for
habeas
corpus
relief,
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
presented
for
the
first
time
in
a
second
or
subsequent
federal
petition.
the
facts
can
be
summarized
in
brief.
petitioner,
warren
mccleskey,
was
tried
for
the
murder
of
a
policeman
in
a
georgia
trial
court
in
1978.
at
trial,
one
officer
evans
who
had
occupied
a
cell
next
to
mccleskey
testified
that
mccleskey
had
admitted
and
boasted
about
the
murder
while
in
jail.
on
the
basis
of
this
and
other
evidence,
the
jury
convicted
mccleskey
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
in
his
first
state
habeas
proceeding,
mccleskey
alleged
the
statements
he
made
to
evans
while
in
jail
were
elicited
without
assistance
of
counsel
in
violation
of
our
ruling
in
massiah
versus
united
states.
the
massiah
rule
is
that
once
a
suspect
has
a
lawyer,
the
police
cannot
circumvent
the
lawyer-client
relation
by
using
an
informant
to
elicit
statements
from
the
suspect.
mccleskey
was
denied
habeas
relief
in
state
court.
he
then
filed
his
first
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
without
raising
the
massiah
claim.
after
lengthy
petitions
on
a
first
federal
habeas
petition,
the
district
court
denied
mccleskey
relief.
mccleskey
applied
for
a
habeas
relief
a
second
time
in
state
court,
again
omitting
the
massiah
claim.
he
was
denied
all
relief.
in
1987,
mccleskey
filed
a
second
federal
habeas
action,
this
time
raising
the
massiah
claim.
the
state
responded
to
the
1987
federal
petition
by
conteding
that
mccleskey's
assertion
of
the
massiah
claim
for
the
first
time
was
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
the
district
court
rejected
the
state's
abuse
of
the
writ
contention
and
found
the
massiah
violation.
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
and
held
that
mccleskey
had
abused
the
writ.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
our
opinion
is
lengthy
and
does
not
admit
of
easy
summary.
it
begins
by
examining
the
historical,
statutory,
and
judicial
principles
that
inform
the
equitable
doctrine
of
abuse
of
the
writ.
we
conclude
from
this
examination
that
a
claim
raised
for
the
first
time
in
a
second
or
subsequent
petition
constitutes
an
abuse
of
the
writ
if
it
was
omitted
from
the
prior
petition
through
inexcusable
neglect.
we
define
inexcusable
neglect.
we
determine
that
the
same
cause
and
prejudice
standard
used
to
determine
whether
to
excuse
state
procedural
defaults
should
govern
the
determination
of
inexcusable
neglect
in
the
context
of
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine.
both
our
procedural
default
rules
and
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
imply
a
background
norm
of
procedural
regularity
binding
on
petitioners.
the
power
to
excuse
both
types
of
defaulted
claims
derives
from
the
court's
equitable
discretion.
the
doctrines
of
procedural
default
and
abuse
of
the
writ
implicate
nearly
identical
concerns
flowing
from
the
significant
costs
of
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
one
of
the
law's
very
objectives
is
the
finality
of
its
judgments.
neither
innocence
nor
just
punishment
can
be
vindicated
until
the
final
judgment
is
known.
the
writ
strikes
its
finality
and
multiple
habeas
proceedings
burdens
scarce
federal
judicial
resources
and
may
give
litigants
the
incentive
to
manipulate
claims.
of
course,
the
writ
overrides
all
these
considerations
as
essential
as
they
are
to
the
rule
of
law,
when
a
petitioner
raises
a
meritorious
claim
in
a
proper
manner
in
a
federal
habeas
petition.
cause
and
prejudice
standard
for
the
doctrines
of
procedural
default
and,
by
today's
decision,
abuse
of
the
writ,
define
this
dimension
of
procedural
regularity.
applying
the
standards
to
the
facts
of
the
case
before
us,
we
hold
that
mccleskey
lacked
cause
failing
to
raise
his
massiah
claim
in
his
first
federal
petition.
and
so,
he
abused
the
writ
by
deferring
the
claim
until
his
second
habeas
action.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
we
assume
that
mccleskey
did
not
at
the
time
of
his
first
federal
petition
know
about
certain
evidence
relating
to
the
massiah
claim.
this
lack
of
knowledge
does
not
establish
that
mccleskey
had
cause
for
failure
to
raise
the
massiah
claim
in
his
first
federal
action
however.
but
the
evidence
he
did
possess
did
not
present
him
from
raising
the
claim.
indeed,
the
very
evidence
on
which
he
places
primary
reliance
was
discovered
after
he
raised
the
massiah
claim
in
the
second
federal
action.
the
narrow
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
to
the
cause
requirement
is
of
no
avail
to
mccleskey.
he
cannot
demonstrate
that
the
alleged
massiah
violation
caused
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
person
because
the
evans'
statement
that
he
now
seeks
to
embrace
confirms
his
guilt.
justice

files
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
