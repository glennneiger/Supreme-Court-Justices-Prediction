mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
concessions
made
by
the
government
in
this
case
are
critical
to
the
resolution
of
this
case,
and
primarily
those
concessions
deal
with
the
gonzalez
act.
basically,
what
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
is
they
addressed
two
questions.
the
first
question
was,
one,
whether
a
military
doctor
who
is
working
in
a
foreign
country
is
immune
under
the
gonzalez
act
from
suits
for
medical
malpractice.
and
the
court
in
that
situation
said
that
the
doctor
was
not
so
immune
and
could
be
sued,
regardless
where
the
suit
was
brought.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
which
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
but
the
first
issue
that
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
in
its
opinion
was
the
gonzalez
act.
once
they
addressed
that
issue
and
found
that
there
was
a
remedy
under
the
gonzalez
act,
they
then
turned
to
an
analysis
of
the,
what
is
called
reform
act,
to
determine
whether
or
not
dr.
marshall
was
immune
under
the
reform
act.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
and--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--well,
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
how
clear--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--well,
i
think
the
court
went
part
way.
they
did
indeed,
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
said,
they
did
make
a
statement
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
that
because
there
was
no
remedy
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
that
dr.
marshall
was
not
immune.
you
have
to
also
understand
that
as
they
concluded
their
opinion,
the
very
last
sentence
before
the
conclusion
was
that
we
hold,
as
did
the
eleventh
circuit
in
newman
v.
soballe,
that
the
doctor
is
not
immune
from
a
lawsuit.
now--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--in
the
limited
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
would,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
being,
this
case
involved
a
claim
that
arose
in
a
foreign
country,
and
because
it
was
different
than
all
the
other
exceptions
contained
under
2680.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
earlier,
and
as
the
legislative
history
has
pointed
out
in
the
gonzalez
act,
congress
recognized
that
they
could
not
legislate
and
they
could
not
impose
their
laws
on
the
sovereign
of
another
country.
that
is
why
the
federal
tort
claims
act
does
not
apply
in
a
foreign
country.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
and
their
holding,
as
they
said
in
their
last
sentence
of
their
opinion
before
the
conclusion,
was
the
same
as
the
holding
in
newman
v.
soballe.
now,
newman
v.
soballe
clearly
stated,
and
again
it
gets
back
now
to
the
concessions
of
what
the
government
has
conceded.
newman
v.
soballe
said
that
a
military
doctor
is
protected
by
the
gonzalez
act
and
is
therefore
not
among
those
federal
employees
affected
by
the
westfall
decision
or
the
reform
act.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
i
prefer
to
refer
to
it
as
a
remedy,
your
honor,
but
i
would
also
agree
that
a
cause
of
action
would
be
an
acceptable
synonym.
and
indeed,
although
the
government
is
arguing
here
today
that
the
gonzalez
act
does
not
provide
a
remedy,
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
at
page
5
of
their
petition
they
say
that
the
gonzalez
act
regulates
the
remedies
available
for
malpractice
by
military
physicians.
and
on
the
very
next
page
of
that
opinion,
of
that
petition,
they
say
that
the
eleventh
circuit
in
newman
v.
soballe
clearly
held
that
congress
intended
for
the
gonzalez
act
to
permit
suits
against
a
military
doctor
when
the
federal
tort
claims
act
excepted...
when
the
federal
tort
claims
act
exceptions
foreclosed
suit
against
the
united
states.
and
they
then
said--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--they
wouldn't
appeal
from
that.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
well,
first
of
all,
the
gonzalez
act
in
1089(a)
does
talk
about
a
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
in
1089(f)--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--is
exclusive.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
that...
other
than
what
might
be
available
through
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
then
we
go
to
1089(f),
which
indicates
that
the
secretary
may
hold
the
doctor
harmless
or
indemnify
him
in
situations
where
he
may
be
detailed
to
a
foreign
country--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--or
a
federal
institution,
or
under
some
other
circumstances--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--well,
that's
why
i
prefer
to
refer
to
it
as
a
remedy,
your
honor,
because
as
the
government
has
taken
the
position...
for
example,
prior
to
the
westfall
legislation,
when
we
only
had
the
gonzalez
act...
the
gonzalez
act
was
enacted
in
1976,
and
since
1976
until
1989
the
government
made
the
argument
that
the
gonzalez
act
provided
an
exclusive
remedy
only
through
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
they
refused,
until
the
newman
decision
in
1989,
to
acknowledge
that
suit
can
be
permitted
against
an
individual
doctor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
the
latter,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
well,
your
honor,
the
government
has
already
conceded
that
they
had
no
disagreement
and
they
were
not
appealing
from
the
rationale
of
either
newman
or
smith
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
a
doctor
can
be
sued
in
his
individual
capacity,
and
the
government
would
then
indemnify
him.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
well,
with
regard
to
the
reform
act,
because
it
did
not
carry
a
provision
similar
to
what's
contained
in
1089(f),
and
because
of
the
legislative
history
which
cites
the
gonzalez
act
with
some
approval,
we
believe
that
congress
intended
for
1089(f)
to
remain
viable
so
that
an
individual
doctor
would
still
be
protected
from
individual
liability
for,
among
other
things,
suits
that
occur
either
in
a
foreign
country
or
in
the
united
states
if
the
claim
arose
in
a
foreign
country.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
same
year
that
the
reform
act
was
enacted,
congress
amended
the
veterans
administration
statute,
38
u.s.c.
4116.
it
also
contains
a
similar
provision
to
what
is
contained
in
1089(f),
providing
for
indemnification
of
veterans
administration
doctors.
they
passed
that
in
the
same
year
that
they
passed
the
reform
act.
they
obviously
intended
words
such
as
the
indemnification
in
1089(f)
to
have
effect.
the
government
has
conceded
that
as
an
alternative
basis
for
affirming
that
the
rationale
that
was
interpreted
by
the
courts
below
interpreting
gonzalez
could
be
a
separate
basis
for
affirming.
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--well,
in
their
petition
at
page
20--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
brief
on
the
merits,
what
they
are
arguing
in
there
is
that
the
gonzalez
act
continues
to
have
viability,
but
the
viability
is
now
limited
to
(1)
a
suit
against
the
doctor
in
a
foreign
country
and
(2)
to
an
intentional
tort,
such
an
assault
and
battery.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
they
arrive
at
that,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
i
understand.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
wasn't
necessarily
the
decision
that
was
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
did,
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
did
mention
in
passing
that
there
was
no
remedy
available
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
that's
why
dr.
marshall
is
not
immune.
but
i
also
indicate
that
because
this
is
an
incident
that
occurred
in
a
foreign
country,
and
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
congress
recognize
that
does
not
extent
to
a
foreign
country,
that
is
why
in
this
situation
the
reform
act
does
not
apply.
with
regard
to
the
reform
act,
there
seems
again
to
be
some
discussion
about
what
the
respondents'
position
is
with
regard
to
28
u.s.c.
2679(b)(2).
that
is
the
provision
that
has
the
two
exceptions
within
the
reform
act,
the
two
exceptions
being
to
bring
a
suit
against
a
federal
employee
in
his
individual
capacity
either
for
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or,
two,
for
a
violation
of
a
statute
of
the
united
states
under
which
such
action
against
the
individual
is
otherwise
authorized.
now,
although
government
seems
to
think
we
don't
rely
upon
that
statute,
we
do.
obviously
we
did
not
rely
upon
that
statute
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
because
the
lawsuit
was
filed
more
than
a
year
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
obviously
we
could
not
have.
the
statute
was
not
enacted
until
this
matter
had
already
gone
through
the
district
court
and
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
it's
clear
that
the
statutes
that
congress
contemplated
had
to
include,
among
others,
the
gonzalez
act.
the
only
legislative
history
that
we
have
from
congress
on
that
talks
in
terms
of
preserving
legal
remedies
that
existed
before,
not
changing
any
legal
remedies
that
existed
before.
and
so
as
they
were
passing
this
legislation
to
protect
what
they
perceived
was
a
change
in
the
law
caused
by
this
court's
decision
in
westfall
v.
erwin,
they
did
not
change
any
of
the
other
statutes
that
already
existed,
among
them
the
gonzalez
act.
now,
the
use
of
the
term
"violation",
i
am
not
sure
why
congress
used
that
word.
there
is
no
mention
in
the
legislative
history
why
they
used
that
word.
it's
a
shorthand
term.
certainly
with
regard
to
the
constitution
you
can't
bring
an
action
against
someone
for
violating
the
constitution.
you
bring
an
action
against
someone
for
violating
the
rights
that
another
person
has
under
the
constitution.
and
for
the
same
logic,
the
law...
violation
of
a
statute
of
the
united
states
would
also
say
that
you
can
sue
an
individual
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
a
statute
where
this
federal
statute
permitted
a
remedy
against
the
individual
doctor.
again,
the
gonzalez
act,
1089(f).
there's
been
some
discussion
also
about
whether
or
not
a
remedy
has
been
created.
clearly
before
the
westfall
legislation
was
enacted,
the
gonzalez
act
did
permit,
under
1089(f),
a
doctor
to
be
indemnified,
which
obviously
meant,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
he
could
be
sued
in
his
individual
capacity.
but
before
the
newman
decision,
the
government
relied
upon
cases
like
powers
v.
schultz,
and
in
those
cases
they
were
making
the
same
argument
that
they're
making
now.
and
the
argument
there
was
that
there
was
only
a
remedy
if
you
could
be
sued
in
a
foreign
country.
that
was
rejected
by
newman,
that
was
rejected
by
smith,
and
the
westfall
legislation
doesn't
in
any
way
indicate
that
those
interpretations
should
be
changed.
in
the
case
of
powers
v.
schultz,
when
the
government
won
that
decision,
the
plaintiff
was
dismissed
from
court
and
there
was
no
remedy
for
that
plaintiff.
under
newman
and
under
smith,
because
the
doctor
was
allowed
to
be
sued
in
his
individual
capacity,
it
allowed
a
suit
to
proceed
against
the
doctor
and
for
a
potential
remedy
against
the
doctor.
we
believe
that
there
is
sufficient
rationale
in
the
holding
of
the
smith
case,
and
particularly
as
it
applies
to
adopting
the
holding
in
newman
v.
soballe,
that
the
gonzalez
act
is
still
a
viable
statute,
and
as
a
viable
statute,
a
remedy
is
available
against
the
doctor
individually,
regardless
of
where
the
suit
is
filed.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
yes.
and
that's
a
good
point,
justice
stevens,
because
in
your
inquiry
of
government
counsel
you
had
asked
about
a
comparison
of
the
provisions
in
the
drivers
act
and
in
the
gonzalez
act.
in
the
gonzalez
act,
the
remand
provision
under
1089(c)
is
a
remand
of
a
case
to
state
court
where
there
is
no
remedy.
the
drivers
act,
as
it
existed,
did
not
have
similar
language.
the
drivers
act
language
was
limited
to
remand
when
the
driver
was
found
to
be
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment,
not
whether
or
not
a
remedy
was
available
to
him.
but
it's
clear
that
the
drivers
act
was
assimilated
into,
and
has
now
been
to
an
extent
broadened
to
become
the
reform
act.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
i'm
not--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--other
than
the
gonzalez
act
and
the
va
statute
and
a
couple
of
the
other
piecemeal
statutes
providing
for
medical
doctors'
immunization,
which
has
subsections
providing
for
intentional
torts,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
provision
that
would
permit
a
suit
for
an
intentional
tort
under
either
the
drivers
act
or
the
reform
act.
so,--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--i
would
think,
to
carry
their
logic,
it
would
have
to
be.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
because
they
are
picking
and
choosing
those
provisions
of
the
gonzalez
act
that
they
believe
have
been
repealed.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
yes.
i
think
there
could
be
an
argument
made
that
a
doctor
could
no
longer...
or
that
1089(e),
which
provides
for
an
intentional
tort
to
be
brought
against
the
united
states,
that
an
argument
can
be
made
that
that
is
no
longer
in
existence.
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
because
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
way
that
congress
cited
the
gonzalez
act
that
they
were
satisfied
with
the
gonzalez
act.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
justice
souter,
prior
to
enactment
of
the
reform
act,
the
gonzalez
act
essentially
carried
those
same
provisions.
but
because
the
gonzalez
act
also
carried
subsection
(f),
it
really
didn't
apply
in
certain
specified
situations
for
military
doctors.
it's
our
contention
that
gonzalez
act
is
still
viable,
and
that
that
all-encompassing
language
of
(d)(4)
doesn't
really
apply
to
dr.
marshall.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
no,
because
in
this
particular
case...
again,
it
is
an
incident
that
occurred
in
a
foreign
country,
and
congress
doesn't
really
extend
to
a
foreign
country.
that's
why
we
don't
believe--
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
introductory
language
to
2680,
the
language
specifically
says
that
this
section
and
this
chapter
shall
not
apply
to
any
of
the
following,
which
includes
a
foreign
country.
the
reform
act
happens
to
be
located
in
that
chapter,
chapter
171
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
so
by
its
own
terms
would
not
apply.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
basically,
in
any
type
of
a
common
law
tort
situation
it
would
be
available
as
an
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
as
the
legislative
history
clearly
points
out
at
page
3
of
the
house
report,
the
examples
of
the
kinds
of
claims
that
may
be
brought
against
federal
employees
includes
suits
for
clerical
negligence
in
typing
or
filing
documents,
errors
in
benefit
determination,
suits
against
park
rangers.
those
were
the
things
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
were
enacting
the
reform
act
or
the
westfall
legislation.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
yes.
mr.
walter
a.
oleniewski
thank
you.
