justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
other
case,
united
states
against
smith
no.
89-1646
is
here
on
a
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
respondents,
david
cober
against
the
military
position
for
malpractice
committed
at
an
army
hospital
in
italy.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
bars
recovery
against
the
united
states
for
such
hindrance
occurring
aboard.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
federal
employees
liability
reform
act
also
bars
recovery
against
the
individual
positions.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
