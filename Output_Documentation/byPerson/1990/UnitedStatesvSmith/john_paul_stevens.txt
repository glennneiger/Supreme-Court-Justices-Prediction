justice
stevens
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
mr.
shapiro,
that
it
would
have
permitted
a
cause
of
action
against
the
doctor
on
these
very
facts?
justice
stevens
it
would
not
have
precluded
it.
it
would...
there
would
have
been
no
obstacle,
and
it
would
have
indemnified
the
doctor.
so
that
what
would
have
happened,
assuming
the
complaint
is
meritorious,
that
if
there
had
been
no
reform
act,
just
under
the
gonzalez
act
this
plaintiff
would
have
recovered
and
the
government
would
have
picked
up
the
tab
for
the
doctor.
justice
stevens
but
there
had
been
a...
the
secretary
had
taken
the
appropriate
action--
justice
stevens
--so
that
that
is
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case
if
there
had
been
no
reform
act.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
the
reform
act
is
read
the
way
you
read
it,
this
doctor
now
loses.
and
you
are
saying
that
didn't
change
the
statutory
scheme?
justice
stevens
you
don't
regard
that
as
an
implied
repeal?
justice
stevens
no,
but
it
limits
its
application
to
providing
protection
in
the
case
there
might
be
recovery
under
foreign
law
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
that's
all
that's
left
of
it.
justice
stevens
but
not
the
principal
ones
of
suits
against...
there
were
three
in
the
original
act,
but
now
we're
down
to
part
of
one.
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
those
were
all
in
effect
at
the
time
the
gonzalez
act
was
applied,
weren't
they?
adopted?
justice
stevens
no,
it's
pretended
to
protect
the
doctors--
justice
stevens
--is
what
it
was
doing.
it
provided
complete
protection
to
the
doctors,
but
it
preserved
the
remedy.
whereas
this
other
statute
provides
complete
protection
to
the
employee
by
taking
away
some
remedies.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
critical
for
your
reading
of
the
savings
clause
about
no
violation
of
the
statute.
that's...
i
understand,
i
understand
your
argument
there.
justice
stevens
and
literally
you
perhaps
have
the
better
of
it,
but
one
can
assume
that
perhaps
there
is
some
legislative
history
suggesting
congress
did
not
intend
to
take
away,
except
for
those
created
by
the
westfall
case,
what
had
thought
to
be
other
tort
claim
act...
other
statutory
remedies.
justice
stevens
and
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing,
because
you
might
want
to
address
them
both
together.
is
it
correct
that
there
is
an
absence
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
reform
act
of
any
specific
consideration
of
medical
malpractice
claims?
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
clear.
i
mean
this
much
at
least
is
clear,
is
if
there's
no
remedy
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
then
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
a
state
court,
a
provision
that's
not
in
the
reform
act.
and
therefore
they
clearly
contemplated,
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
suit,
it
would
go
forward.
justice
stevens
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
this
remand
provision
refers
to
the
absence
of
a
remedy.
that's
what
it...
that's
not
the
scope
of
employment.
justice
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
earlier
i
think
you
said
the
statute...
the
reform
act
did
not
expressly
amend
any
other
statute,
something
like
that.
did
it
expressly
repeal
or
supersede
the
motor
vehicle
act?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another...
i
may
make
you
a
little
far
afield,
but
i
am
curious.
under
the
drivers
act,
or
under
the
reform
act
since
then,
has
it
been
decided
whether
an
intentional
tort
may
be
sued
upon?
justice
stevens
say
a
driver,
you
know,
some
wild
allegation
he
intentionally
insulted
someone.
would
that
be
covered
by--
justice
stevens
--i
suppose
if
we,
if
we
accept
the
government's
position
here,
a
suit
against
the
doctor
for
an
intentional
tort
would
also
be
barred,
if
the
gonzalez
act
is
superseded
by
the
reform
act?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
well,
they're
saying
that
whatever
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
reform
act
remains.
that's
what
they
say.
but
if
the...
but
if
the
tort,
basic
tort
act
precludes
recovery
for
intentional
torts...
i
guess
that
is
one
of
the
exemptions,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
then...
and
if
the
statute
applies
to
bar
any
action
except
under
the
reform
act,
that
would
mean
an
intentional
tort
action
would
be
barred,
i
would
think--
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
i'm
just
curious.
other
than
the
gonzalez
act
and
the
motor
vehicle
statute,
are
there
other
statutes
where
there
was
specific
problems
within
the
general
area
of
coverage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
were
addressed
by
special
legislation?
