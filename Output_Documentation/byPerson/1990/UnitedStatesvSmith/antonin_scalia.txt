justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i--
justice
scalia
--that
could
mean
to
permit
suits
where
suits
are
otherwise
available,
but
not
to
create
a
cause
of
action.
what,
what
language
do
you
rely
upon
in
the
gonzalez
act
as
conferring
a
cause
of
action?
justice
scalia
well,
wait
a
minute.
what
does
it
say
about
that?
it
says
that
that...
that
remedy
under
the
tort
claims
act--
justice
scalia
--shall
be
exclusive.
now
that
doesn't
confer
any
cause
of
action,
does
it?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right.
it
certainly
confers
no
new
cause
of
action.
it
says
the
tort
claims
act
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.
what
other
language
in
the
gonzalez
act?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
create
a
cause
of
action
either.
it
just
says
if
he
is
held
liable,
you
can
identify...
indemnify.
justice
scalia
did
they
say
that
it
provided
an
exclusive
remedy
under
the
tort
claims
act,
or
did,
do
they
say
that
it
provided
that
the
remedy
under
the
tort
claims
act
is
exclusive?
justice
scalia
the
latter.
i
don't
see
that
it
creates
any
remedy
at
all.
it
just
speaks
to
exclusivity
of
other
remedies,
and
to
indemnification
for
payment
that
is
made
under
causes
of
action
that
elsewhere
exist.
justice
scalia
well,
they
said
they
are
not
appealing
from
it,
but
to
the
extent
that
you
make
an
argument
based
upon
the
gonzalez
act
that
relates
to
the
interpretation
of
the
reform
act,
i
don't
understand
them
to
have
waived
their
position.
justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
shapiro,
while
you're
on
the
gonzalez
act-type
things,
could
you
explain
to
me
the
purpose
of
the
last
part
of
subsection
(f)
of
the
gonzalez
act?
if
the
exclusiveness
of
remedy
recited
in
the
gonzalez
act,
which
language
is
very
much
like
the
exclusiveness
recitation
in
the
reform
act,
if
that
exclusiveness
prevents
an
action
against
the
employee,
even
where
there
would
be
no
action
available
against
the
united
states,
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
provision
which
allows
the
head
of
the
agency
to
get
liability
insurance,
if
the
circumstances
are
such
as
are
likely
to
preclude
the
remedies
of
third
persons
against
the
united
states?
i...
you
know,
i
read
that
as
embodying
the
assumption
that
if
the
circumstances
are
such
as
are
likely
to
preclude
remedies
against
the
united
states,
there
is
a
remedy
against
the
employee,
and
therefore
he's
going
to
need
insurance.
isn't
that
assumption
sort
of
implicit
in
that?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
the
point
is
that
the
first
part
of
the
gonzalez
act
uses
language
that's
very
similar
to
the
language
you're
relying
on
in
the
reform
act.
justice
scalia
and
if...
if
in
the
gonzalez
act
they
didn't
think
that
that
language
precluded
the
suit
against
the
individual,
why
would
they
in
the
reform
act?
