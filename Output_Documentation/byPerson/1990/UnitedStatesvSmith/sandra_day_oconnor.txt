justice
o'connor
well,
now,
mr.
shapiro,
the
government
did
not
bring
here
the
question
about
the
gonzalez
act,
and--
justice
o'connor
--that
strikes
me
as
a
little
unusual.
it's
very
difficult
to
know
how
the
statutory
scheme
fits
together
if
you
don't
know
the
meaning
of
the
gonzalez
act.
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
we
do
have
to
get
into
it,
and
understand
at
least
what
the
gonzalez
act
means?
justice
o'connor
are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
you
think
it
means?
justice
o'connor
because
it's
a
mystery
to
me.
justice
o'connor
does
the
gonzalez
act
grant
any
affirmative
right
to
sue
the
physician?
justice
o'connor
but
that
doesn't
apply
if
the
tort
occurs
outside
the
united
states?
justice
o'connor
so
we
can
assume
that
the
gonzalez
act
just
doesn't
apply
if
the
tort
occurs
outside
the
united
states?
justice
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
give
a
cause
of
action?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
doesn't
apply
to
torts
overseas.
so
it
isn't
all
that
clear
on
the
face
of
it,
is
it--
justice
o'connor
--that
the
reform
act
affects
this?
that's,
i
guess,
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
it
says
an
action
or
proceeding
subject
in
paragraph
1,
and
if
you
read
paragraph
1
as
not
applying
overseas,
then
how
does
that
help
you?
