justice
souter
--what
is
your
response
here
to
mr.
shapiro's
argument
based
on
2679(d)(4)
to
the
effect
that,
in
the
provision
there,
that
once
there
has
been
a
scope
certification
and
a
substitution
of
the
united
states,
the
action
proceeds
subject
to
the
limitations
and
exceptions
applicable
to
those
actions?
his
argument
is
that
there
would
be
no
utility
in
that
reference
to
subject
to
limitations
and
exceptions
if
remedy
were
to
be...
were
to
be
limited
to
cases
in
which
recovery
is
possible.
justice
souter
if
we
don't
accept
your
position
on
the
gonzalez
act,
does
this
argument
defeat
you
under
the
reform
act?
justice
souter
well,
isn't
that
one
of
the
limitations
and
exceptions
to
which
(d)(4)
refers?
justice
souter
what,
what
then
do
we
make
of
(d)(4)?
what
is
its
utility?
justice
souter
um-hum.
justice
souter
so
it
would
basically,
in
most
cases
it
would
refer,
then,
to
limitations
and
so
on
under
the
local
law?
justice
souter
yeah,
okay.
