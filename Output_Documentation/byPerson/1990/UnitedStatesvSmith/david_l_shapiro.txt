mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
respondents
brought
an
action
against
dr.
william
marshall,
a
u.s.
army
physician,
alleging
malpractice
occurring
while
dr.
marshall
was
stationed
overseas
in
italy.
the
government
moved
to
substitute
the
united
states
as
defendant,
because
dr.
marshall
was
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment
at
the
time
of
the
acts
complained
of,
and
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
because
under
an
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act
for
claims
arising
in
a
foreign
country,
recovery
could
not
be
had
against
the
united
states.
the
motions
were
granted
by
the
district
court,
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
provision
requiring
substitution
of
the
united
states
and
precluding
an
action
against
the
individual
did
not
apply
when
an
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act
barred
recovery
against
the
united
states.
because
of
a
conflict
among
the
circuits,
the
case
was
brought
here
for
review.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
the
meaning
of
the
gonzalez
act
is
very
much
part
of
the
case,
your
honor.
the
question...
we
think
the
broad
question
whether
this
action
precluded...
is
precluded
by
the
tort
reform
act
of
1980...
1988
fairly
does
embrace
the
gonzalez
act
issue.
in
any
event,
the
respondents
have
relied
entirely
on
the
gonzalez
act
as
a
basis
for
affirming
the
judgment
below.
and
we
agree
that--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
i'm
going
to
try--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i'm
going
to
try.
we
do
believe
that
the
case
presents
two
very
closely
related
questions.
one
is
whether
the
tort
reform
act
of
1988
in
its
own
terms
applies
to
require
substitution
of
the
united
states
and
precludes
an
action
against
dr.
marshall
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
we
submit,
in
disagreement
with
the
court
below,
that
it
plainly
does,
both
in
the
light
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
clearly
expressed
purpose,
and
its
history.
the
second
question
in
the
case,
which
is
the
question
you,
justice
o'connor,
referred
to,
is
whether
the
gonzalez
act
of
1976
precludes
the
application
of
the
reform
act
in
this
case.
our
position
is
that
it
does
not.
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
provisions
of
the
gonzalez
act
and
the
broad
protection
afforded
by
the
reform
act,
and
that
in
the
event
of
any
conflict
the
provisions
of
the
reform
act
are
required
to--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that's
a
critical
point
of
disagreement
between
us
and
the
respondents.
the
respondents
attempt
to
suggest
throughout
their
brief
a
point
which
was
not
at
all
the
basis
of
the
decision
below,
and
that
is
that
they
are
pursuing
a
remedy
under
the
gonzalez
act.
they
are
not.
that
was
evident
from
their
complaint.
the
basis
of
their
assertion
of
federal
jurisdiction
was
diversity
of
citizenship.
they
allege
malpractice
by
the
doctor
under
italian
law,
under
california
law,
and
under
something
described
as
general
american
law,
which
perhaps
was
an
effort
to
resuscitate
swift
against
tyson,
but
was
clearly
not
a
reference
to
the
gonzalez
act.
what
the
gonzalez
act
does,
we
submit,
is
to
protect
physicians
in
two
ways.
first
and
most
significantly,
it
protects
physicians
against
suit
by...
requiring
the
substitution
of
the
united
states
as
a
defendant.
and
indeed,
the
fifth
circuit
held
a
few
years
ago
that
that
preclusion,
that
protection,
applied
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
the
gonzalez
act
itself
is
less
than
completely
clear
on
whether
the
preclusion
of
that
act
applies
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
court
below
held
that
it
did
not.
we
are
not
objecting
to
that
ruling
here.
a
number
of
courts
have
held
that
in
contrast
to
the
powers--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
gonzalez
act
does
not
preclude...
that
is,
we
do
not
challenge
the
holding
of
the
court
below
that
the
gonzalez
act
does
not
preclude
the
action
against
the
doctor
in
this
case,
the
gonzalez
act
itself.
the
other--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
the
other
form
of
protection
that
was
given
to
doctors
and
related
medical
and
dental
personnel
under
the
gonzalez
act
was
to
authorize
indemnification
in
situations
where
the
doctors
might
be
held
liable
under
some
other
law.
for
example,
if
they
were
sued
in
a
foreign
country
and
held
liable
under
foreign
law,
and
perhaps
if
they
were
sued
in
other
situations
where
the
tort
claims
act
was
not
available.
but
the
only
function
of
the
gonzalez
act,
subsection
(f),
we
submit,
was
to
authorize
indemnification
of
doctors.
it
did
not
create
a
cause
of
action
against
them.
it
did
not
authorize
a
cause
of
action
against
them.
and
that
is
why,
in
our
view,
there
is--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--it
would
not
have
precluded
it.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
gonzalez
act
itself
did
not
require
indemnification.
it
authorizes
it,
but
the
regulations--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
yes--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
we're
saying
that
there
is
no
repeal
of
any
aspect
of
the
gonzalez
act.
how...
the
reform
act
we
do
agree,
indeed
it's
the
basis
of
our
argument,
changes
the
result
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
regard
that--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't.
and--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
gonzalez
act
provides
that
a
doctor
may
be
indemnified
in
situations
where
under
some
other
law
the
doctor
is
held
liable.
we
don't
believe
that
the
reform
act
repeals
the
gonzalez
act
any
more
than
a
decision
by
italy
or
california
to
abolish
the
tort
of
malpractice
would
repeal
the
gonzalez
act.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
it
limits
its
application.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
there
may
be
other
situations
in
which
indemnification--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
it
may
include
another,
because
there
may
be
situations
in
which
a
doctor
is
lent
to
a
state
or
a
private
institution,
and
is
sued
in
situations
where
the
case
cannot
be
regarded
as
one
within
the
scope
of
his
federal
employment,
and
therefore
one
where
the
tort
claims
act
remedy
is
relevant.
to
return,
if
i
may
for
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
return
to
this
also,
but
to
return
for
a
minute
to
the
broader
question
in
this
case
on
which
there
is
this
conflict
among
the
circuits.
we
submit
that
the
reform
act
in
its
own
terms
clearly
does
require
substitution
of
the
united
states
and
precludes
the
action
against
the
individual.
indeed
the
respondents
appear
to
have
conceded
that
point
in
their
brief.
they
do
not
pursue
it.
they
rely
only
on
the
argument
that
the...
whatever
action
was
available
under
the
gonzalez
act
is
preferred...
is
preserved.
in
our
view
that
concession
is
correct.
we
think
there
is
no
question
under
the
text
of
the
reform
act
that
substitution
of
the
united
states
is
required
here,
and
that
the
action
against
dr.
marshall
is
precluded.
to
begin
with
the
text
of
the
reform
act,
it
starts
in
what
is
now
subsection
(b)(1)
of
section
2679,
by
saying
that
the
remedy
against
the
united
states
provided
by
1346(b)
is
exclusive
of
any
other
civil
action--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
the
ninth...
the
ninth
circuit
did
certainly
address
that
question
squarely,
but
we
think
it
didn't
read
the
act
as
a
whole,
or...
nor
did
it
focus
on
the
legislative
findings.
that
is,
you
start
with
what
is
now
2679(b)(1).
we
concede
that
that
section
standing
alone
is
capable
of
two
different
readings,
although
we
contend
the
far
more
plausible
reading
is
that
you
have
to
take
the
tort
claims
act
remedy
with
its
exceptions
and
limitations.
we
believe
that
that
reading
is
confirmed
beyond
any
doubt
first
by
subsection
(b)(4),
which
is
a
part
of
the
same
statute,
and
which
says
that
upon
certification
that
an
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
the
action
against
the
united
states
shall
proceed
and
shall
be
subject
to
the
limitations
and
exceptions
applicable
to
those
sections.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
we
think...
we
think
it's
clear
that
paragraph
(b)(1)
itself...
we
concede
that
it
is
capable
of
two
readings,
but
that
standing
alone
the
far
more
plausible
one
is
the
one
we
urge.
and
we,
i'm
sure,
would
be
here
today
making
the
same
argument
if
(b)(4)
were
not
there.
but
we
think
that
(b)(4)
confirms
the
natural
reading
of
(b)(1)
that
the
action
can
go
forward,
must
go
forward,
subject
to
the
limitations
and
exceptions
of
the
act
itself,
including
those
in
2680.
indeed
that's
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history.
the
house
committee
report
said,
and
i
quote,
"any
claim
against
the
government
that
is
precluded
by
the
exceptions
in
2680
is
also
precluded
against
an
employee,
or
his
or
her
estate.
"
we
also
believe
that
that
reading
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
findings
that
were
made
in
the
reform
act,
that
were
incorporated
in
the
act
in
section
2.
those
findings
start
by
suggesting
that
this
court's
decision
in
westfall
against
erwin,
which
had...
just
previously
been
announced,
seriously
eroded
the
common
law
immunity
previously
available
to...
federal
employees.
in
the
view
of
congress,
the
erosion
of
that
immunity
had
created
an
immediate
crisis,
and
i
am
reading
again
from
the
findings
"involving
the
prospect
of
liability
and
the
threat
of
protracted
litigation.
"
so,
justice
stevens,
to
return
to
an
earlier
question
of
yours,
congress
was
concerned
not
only
with
the
threat
of
liability,
but
with
the
threat
of
protracted
personal
tort
litigation
for
the
entire
federal
work
force.
and
congress
does
not
suggest
in
doing
that
that
the
employees
whose
conduct
falls
within
the
exceptions
of
section
2680
are
in
any
sense
different
from
federal
employees
whose
conduct
is
subject
to,
not
only
to
suit
under
the
tort
claims
act,
but
to
recovery
as
well.
and
the
findings
go
on
to
say
that
granting
broad
protection
to
individual
employees
is
necessary
to
the
morale
and
well-being
of
the
federal
work
force.
i
should
emphasize,
if
i
may,
that
the
respondents
at
the
end
of
their
brief
have
seriously
overstated
the
consequences
of
the
position
that
the
government
is
urging
here.
they
suggest
that
the
effect
is
to...
really
is
to
leave
the
respondents
without
any
remedy
whatever.
it
is
true
that
our
position
is
that
respondents
cannot
recover
either
under
federal
or
state
law
in
court
for
the
wrongs
they
allege.
but
they
do
have
a
remedy,
they
did
at
the
time,
and
they
still
do,
under
the
military
claims
act,
10
u.s.c.
section
2733.
millions
of
dollars
are
paid
every
year
under
that
statute
on
the
basis
of
claims
of
malpractice
in
situations
where
the
recovery
is
not
available
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
it
is
also
true
that
under
a
program
called
the
civilian
health
and
military
medical
program
of
the
uniformed
services,
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
child's
care,
costs
of
medical
care,
are
covered
until
the
child
is
21,
and
if
the
child
is
severely
handicapped,
then
for
the
rest
of
their
life.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
the
timing,
but
i
think
that
they
were.
the
gonzalez
act,
your
honor,
was
not
intended
to
protect
or
to
provide
a
remedy
for
individuals.
that
was--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
this
returns,
and
i
think
it's
more
than
a
matter
of
semantics,
justice
stevens.
it
returns
to
what
i
think
is
a
critical
distinction
between
preserving
a
remedy,
authorizing
a
remedy,
or
creating
a
remedy.
and--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there
is
an
indication--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
only
references,
i
believe,
in
the
legislative
history
to
medical
malpractice
are
references
to
the
gonzalez
act
as
an
example
of
situations
in
which
actions
are
precluded,
and
a
reference
to
the
powers
case,
which
is
very
much
like
this
case,
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
an
action
of
this
type
was
precluded
by
the
gonzalez
act
itself.
but
no
general
discussion
of
malpractice.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
congress
was
concerned
about
all
potential
tort
liability
of
all
federal
employees,
and
of
course,
there
is
no
question
at
all
that
a
great
many
malpractice
claims
are
within
the
scope
of
the
reform
act.
and
it's
our
contention
that
all
malpractice
claims
are.
with
respect
to
the
focus
of
the
gonzalez
act,
we
do
believe,
as
i
think
you
agree,
that
the
purpose
of
the
gonzalez
act
was
to
protect
physicians,
that
the...
and
related
medical
personnel.
that
the
primary
means
for
affording
that
protection
was
to
preclude
suit
against
them
as
individuals
and
to
require
suit
against
the
united
states.
it
is
not
clear
from
either
the
text
of
the
act
itself
or
its
history
to
what
extent
that
preclusion
was
total.
and
every
court
that
faced
that
question
of
the
gonzalez
act
recognized
that
it
was
a
difficult
question.
we
do
believe,
in
view
of
subsection
(f)
and
the
legislative
history,
that
it's
not
appropriate
to
contest--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
the
provision--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there's
a
provision
of
the
old
drivers
act,
which
was
very
similar
to
the
remand
provision
of
this
act,
which
was
interpreted
by
the
courts
to
apply
only
when
it
was
determined
that
the
employee
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
that
is,
the
remand
provision--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--so
did
the
old
provision
of
the
drivers
act.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that
is,
the
question
what
the...
phrase
absence
of
a
remedy
means
was
much
debated
in
the
lower
courts.
we
think
it's
been
resolved
by
the
new
provisions
of
the
reform
act.
but
under
the
old
provisions,
it
was
held
under
the
drivers
act
by
several
courts
that
the
phrase
the
absence
of
a
remedy
referred
to
the
availability
under
1346
of
a
suit
against
the
united
states
and
not
to
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
internal
exceptions
within
the
act
itself.
so
that
the
only
situation
which
a
remedy
was
absent
in
the
view
of
those
courts
was
where
the
employee
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
if
i
may
return
to
a
point
which
i
think
was
implicit
in
your
earlier
question,
the
issue
whether
the
broad
scope
of
the
reform
act
is
in
any
way
limited
by
the
gonzalez
act,
we
think
is
illuminated
by
the
fact
that
the
reform
act
itself
contains
two
very
specific
exceptions
in
subsection
(b)(2):
an
action
may
be
brought
against
an
individual
for
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
a
bivens
action
which,
of
course,
is
not
this
case,
or
may
be
brought
against
an
individual
for
a
violation
of
the
statute
of
the
united
states.
i
don't
want
to
rehearse
my
earlier
effort
to
answer
justice
o'connor,
but
we
do
think
it's
clear
that
this
action
against
dr.
marshall
is
not
an
action
for
a
violation
of
the
statute
of
the
united
states.
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
case
clearly
did
not
regard
it
as
such.
now
this
court
has
said
in
andrews
against
glover
and
a
number
of
other
cases
that
when
there
is
a
specific
enumerated
exception
in
an
act,
this
court
should
be
very
reluctant
to
apply
an
additional
exception
in
the
absence
of
very
clear
legislative
intent.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
legislative
intent,
either
clear
or
cloudy
in
this
case.
now,
the
respondents
try
to
answer
that
by
invoking
another
doctrine
of
statutory
construction,
the
doctrine
involving
a
presumption
against
implied
repeals.
we
have
attempted,
i
think,
already
to
explain
why
in
our
view
there
is
no
implied
repeal
in
this
case.
not
only
is
there
still
room
for
the
gonzalez
act
itself
to
operate,
but
the
gonzalez
act
itself
simply
authorized
indemnification
of
a
physician
when
in
fact
a
physician
was
held
liable
under
the
provisions
of
some
other
law.
so
that
if
the
other
law
under
which
a
doctor
might
be
held
liable
prevents
the
suit
against
the
doctor,
that
simply
reduces
the
need
for
indemnification.
it
does
not,
in
our
view,
in
any
way
repeal
the
statute.
we
do,
however,
go
on
in
our
brief,
and
i
would
like
to
underscore
that
to
the
extent
this
court
believes
there
is
any
tension
or
conflict
between
that
provision
of
the
gonzalez
act
and
the
broad
scope
of
the
reform
act,
that
this
case,
like
the
case
of
gordon
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
other
cases,
is
a
case
where
the
later
statute
must
be
given
precedence
if
it's
to
be
given
its
full
scope.
there
is
no
doubt,
we
believe,
that
congress
intended
to
protect
federal
employees
not
only
from
liability
but
from
the
threat
of
protracted
litigation.
that's
made
very
specific
in
the
finding.
that
purpose
would
be
severely
undermined
if
the
gonzalez
act,
however
it
might
be
read,
were
to
undercut
the
language
of
the...
the
language
and
purpose
of
the
reform
act
in
this
case.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
two
points,
one
to
correct
the
record
on
one
point.
the
remand
provisions
of
the
old
drivers
act
were
word
for
word
the
same
as
the
remand
provisions
of
the
gonzalez
act.
reading
from
the
old
drivers
act,
it
says
"should
a
united
states
district
court
determine
that
the
case
so
removed
is
one
in
which
a
remedy
by
suit
within
the
meaning
of
subsection
(b)
is
not
available
against
the
united
states,
the
case
shall
be
remanded
to
the
state
court.
"
and
as
i
suggested
earlier,
that
was
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
case
shall
be
remanded
when
it
was
determined
that
the
employee
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
one
other--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
puzzlements
of
this
case
that
led
us
ultimately
not
to
pursue
the
argument
that
the
gonzalez
act
itself
precludes
this
action.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
true.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
gonzalez
act
is
simply
cloudy
on
this
point,
and
the
other
two
parts
of
subsection
(f)
may
well
embrace
points
that
are
consistent
with
a
broader
reading
of
subsection
(a)
of
the
gonzalez
act.
that
clause,
as
a
general
catch-all
clause,
seems
to
give
what
we
regard
as
the
less
plausible
reading
of
the
general
provision
of
gonzalez.
but
when
you
turn
to
the
reform
act,
every
bit
of
evidence
available,
the
text
of
subsection
(4),
the
legislative
findings,
the
legislative
history,
lead
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction.
and
we
believe,
as
the
courts
that
have
construed
the
gonzalez
act
believe,
that
the
general
language
about
the
remedy
being
exclusive
is
susceptible
of
different
readings.
those
courts
have
agreed
that
our
reading
is
the
more
plausible
one.
but
reading
it
in
conjunction
with
subsection
(f),
they
have
felt
constrained
to
conclude
that
the
gonzalez
act
itself
did
not
preclude
the
remedy.
that
factor
simply
is
not
present
under
the
reform
act,
and
the
broad
purpose
of
the
reform
act
to
give
this
kind
of
protection,
we
believe
is
evident
both
from
the
language
from
the
statute
and
its
history.
but
you're
quite
right
that
that
part
of
subsection
(f)
is
simply
there,
and
it's
puzzling.
yes,
justice
stevens?
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there
are
other
statutes
similar
to
the
gonzalez
act.
counsel
referred
to
the
veterans
act,
the
public
health
service
act,
the
state
department
act,
all
of
which
have
provisions
which
are
somewhat
similar.
but
i
should
mention
in
that
connection
that
the
1988
amendment
to
the
veterans
act
that
is
referred
to
simply
incorporates
into
it
the
allowance
of
actions
for
intentional
torts,
or
at
least
the
revision,
and
xx
effective
revision
of
the
intentional
tort
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act,
so
that
a
malpractice
action
may
be
brought
against
a
physician
that
sounds
in
battery.
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
1988
amendment.
there
are
such
statutes,
other
such
statutes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
submit
the
case.
