justice
white
does
this
mean
this
act
isn't
applicable?
is
that
it?
justice
white
are
you
defending
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
well,
they
didn't
need
to
get
to
the
gonzalez
act
at
all.
they
just
said
that
the
reform
act
by
its
own
terms
just
doesn't
apply
to
this
case.
justice
white
well,
that
isn't...
the
government
says
it
isn't.
justice
white
um-hum.
justice
white
but
even
if...
even
if
you
thought
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
that
specific
statement,
you...
you
wouldn't
lose.
justice
white
that's
what
you're
arguing?
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that
the
gonzalez
act
conveys
a
cause
of
action
on
a
plaintiff
who
has
been
allegedly
injured
by
a
federal
doctor?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
they
just
said
that
maybe
we
ought
to,
we
ought
to
remand
to
have
the
gonzalez
act
further
considered.
but
i
thought
the
government
says
we
ought
to
decide
it
here,
and
that
gonzalez...
that
the
gonzalez
act
can't
be
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
justice
white
i'm
talking
about
their
brief
on
the
merits.
justice
white
well,
they
say
it's
of
no
utility
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
but
that's
what
they
urge.
