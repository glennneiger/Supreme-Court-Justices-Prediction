chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-1027,
norfolk
and
western
railway
company
v.
american
train
dispatchers
association
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
berlin,
please
proceed.
it
is
berl-in
and
not
ber-lin
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
berlin,
looking
at
that
same
statutory
language
that
justice
stevens
was
asking
you
about,
at
what
stage
and
by
whom
is
a
finding
of
necessity
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
rest
any
of
its
decision
on
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
necessary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
everyone
would
concede
that
the
action
overriding
those
kinds
was
necessary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.--
--counselor,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
i
take
it
the
necessity
clause
of
13...
of
341
has
to
comply
with
the
minimum
requirements
of
347...
of
11347?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berlin.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
one
wouldn't
have
to
read
it
that
way
as
an
original
proposition
had
it
not
been
for
schwabacher.
at
least
that's
my
view
that
you
could
say
law
means
governing
law,
not
contracts
which
come
into...
into
existence
as
a
result
of
that
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
mahoney?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mahoney,
certainly
the
antitrust
laws
are
set
aside.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
why
shouldn't
all...
well,
why
shouldn't
all
other
law
after
the
antitrust
laws
include
other
federal
laws?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think...
do
you
think
in
schwabacher
there
was
a
conflict?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
there
a
conflict
with
state
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
federal
law
be
equally
preempted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
can
certainly
understand
the
merit
of
that
argument
if
neither
law
said
anything
with
respect
to
the
other.
but
here
the
ica
says
that
people...
a
participant
in
this
transaction
are
exempt
from
the...
i
mean,
it
deals
with
conflict
and
says
that
this
law
prevails,
as
i
read
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
now
you're
not
arguing
the
railway
labor
act
as
having
to
be
adjusted
and
compromised
along
with
the
ica.
you're
saying
that
this
act
itself.
chief
justice
rehnquist
those
are
two
different
arguments
really.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
11347
just
covers
the
period
for
4
years
after
the
date
of
the
final
action
of
the
commission,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well...
didn't
i...
it
must
say
that
in
something
that's
not
before
me,
because
although
the
first
part
certainly
says
4
years.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
first
part
of
11...
unless
i'm
simply
dealing
with
a
typographical...
11347.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
then
go
on
to
the
last
sentence
of
11347
at
the
top
of
page
5a
of
your
appendix.
there
it
does
say,
will
not
be
in
a
worse
position
related
to
employment
as
a
result
of
transaction
during
the
4
years
following
the
effective
date
of
the
following
action
of
the
commission.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
long
ago
did
the
commission
act
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
not
required
them
to
stay,
but
required
the
railroad
to
keep
them
if
they'd
wanted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mahoney.
mr.
minear,
i
believe
you
reserved
2
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1027,
norfolk
&
western
railway
versus
american
train
dispatchers'
association
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
