justice
stevens
mr.
berlin,
can
interrupt
to
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statutory
language?
the
exemption
is
necessary
to
let
that
person
carry
out
the
transaction;
hold,
maintain,
and
operate
property;
and
exercise
control
and
so
forth.
which
of
the
predicates
are
you
relying
on?
is
it
necessary
to
carry
out
the
transaction,
the
necessary
to
operate
their
property,
or
the
necessary
to
exercise
control?
justice
stevens
you
say
that
the
merger
of
the
repair
facilities
4
or
5
years
later
was
essential
to
the
merger
of
the
two
railroads?
justice
stevens
so
that
any
amalgamation
of
facilities
anytime
in
the
future
would
be
exempt
from
all
law?
justice
stevens
then
why
does
it
reach
to
this
one?
justice
stevens
do
they
have
to
be
paradigmatic
changes?
why
doesn't
it
cover
any
change
that
will
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
combined
operation
as
opposed
to
two
separate
operations?
justice
stevens
how
do
we
know
which
ones
it
covers?
that's
the
heart
of
my
question.
justice
stevens
well,
the
easiest
case
is
legal
objections
to
the
transaction
itself.
that's
the
easiest
one,
which
even
the
court
of
appeals
would
recognize.
justice
stevens
but
this
is...
theoretically
you
could
have
merged
the
two
legal
entities
and
continued
to
operate
the
two
separate
car
facilities...
repair
facilities.
justice
stevens
what
if
an
executive
of
one
of
the
corporations
had
a
contract
with
tenure
to
it
that
he
was
no
longer
needed
because
you've
already
got
one
chief
executive
officer.
could
you
fire
him
without
worrying
about
the
contract?
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement...
ordinary
private
contract.
you
don't
need
this
guy
anymore.
justice
stevens
i
know
it
could
be,
but
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
stevens
the
case
would
be
equally
strong
without
the
labor
protective
provisions,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
berlin,
i
have
to
interrupt,
too.
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you,
if
you
say
you
must
comply
with
11347,
that
that
statute
is
not
an
other
law
within
the
meaning
of
11341.
justice
stevens
because
otherwise
you'd
be
exempt
from
it.
justice
stevens
347
is
not
another
law?
justice
stevens
one
of
the
issues
in
that
case
was
what
did
the
state
law
require.
justice
stevens
even
if
the
amount
were
greater
than
the
reasonable
value
of
the
shares
in
the
exchange.
justice
stevens
and
there
had
been
no
determination
of
whether
they
would
be
entitled
to
it
or
not.
justice
stevens
it
would
be
dispositive
of
the
state
law
question
of
whether
they're
entitled
to
100
cents
on
the
dollar
on
the
accrued
dividends.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
similar
to
the
one
i
asked
the...
mr.
berlin?
justice
stevens
supposing
one
of
the
two
railroads
had
long-terms
leases
on
its
executive
offices
and
they
wanted
to
consolidate
their
executive
offices,
could
they
cancel
the
lease?
justice
stevens
well,
what
does
the
statute
provide?
justice
stevens
well,
let's
assume
it's
necessary
and
just
the
same
number
of
dollar
savings
that
you
get
out
of
consolidating
two
car
repair
facilities.
justice
stevens
not
interpreting
the
contract...
how
do
you
interpret
the
transact
without
interpreting
the
contract?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
the
contract
doesn't
provide
for
the
cancellation
on
my
executive
office
leases
and
this
contract
doesn't
provide
for
the
consolidation
of
the
car
repair
facilities,
does
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
it
contemplated
it.
but
was
there
a
contractual
requirement
that
these--
justice
stevens
--supposing
they
could
prove
that
they
contemplated
merging
the
office
space
in
the
two
headquarters'
offices?
justice
stevens
but
there's
nothing
said
about
it
in
the
contract.
justice
stevens
well,
what's
your
view
about
my
hypothetical?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
appropriate
tribunal
decides
whether
the
lease
on
some
property
on
wall
street
is
part
of
the
transaction?
justice
stevens
what
tribunal?
i'm
asking
what
tribunal
makes
that
determination?
justice
stevens
like
the
new
york
state
court
would
do.
