mr.
william
g.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
union
respondents
agree
that
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
section
11341(a)
standing
alone
overrides
contracts
including
collective
bargaining
agreements.
but
the
petitioners
and
the
federal
respondents
acknowledge
that,
regardless
of
how
this
court
rules
on
that
specific
question,
the
disputes
between
the
parties
will
not
be
resolved.
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
3,
norfolk
southern
states
that
the
decision
here
will
be
useful
as
a
guide
to
the
icc
for,
quote,
"it
will
matter
in
the
application
of
the
icc's
authority
to
administer
employee
protective
conditions
under
section
11347
whether
the
railroads
are
already
exempt
from
the
railway
labor
act
and
labor
agreements
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
them
to
carry
out
the
approved
consolidation.
"
and
norfolk
southern
continues,
"the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
made
clear
that
it
will
have
to
reconsider
its
remand
decision
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
petitioners
and
the
federal
respondents
as
to
the
extent
of
the
section
11341
exemption.
"
in
short,
it
is
norfolk
southern's
position
that
should
this
court
agree
with
it,
11341(a)
will
preempt
11347.
it
is
our
position
that
section
11341(a)
standing
alone
should
not
be
read
as
overriding
collectively
bargaining
agreements.
but
if
such
an
interpretation
is
applied
to
it,
section
11347
must
then
be
considered
because
the
exemption
of
11341
extends
only
to
railroads
that
are
prevented
from
carrying
out
a
merger
or
a
control
transaction
as
approved
and
conditioned,
and
section
11347
supplies
the
conditions.
in
texas
against
the
united
states
this
court
held
that
the
scope
of
the
immunity
is
measured
by
the
purpose
which
congress
had
in
view--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--they
will,
but
strip
them
of
their
contract
rights--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue,
your
honor.
the
issue
is
whether--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--no,
the
issue
about
the
transfer,
which
was
tried
before
the
arbitrators
in
both
cases,
and
in
both
cases
the
arbitrators
found
that
these
transfers
were
authorized
by
the
commission,
because
the
commission
said
they
were
authorized
by
the
commission
and
the
arbitrators
considered
themselves
an
agent.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no.
they
don't
object
to
that,
but
what
they
want
to
do
is--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--well,
they
want
to
absolve
themselves
of
the
contractual
obligations
they
have
under
such
as
the
orange
book,
which
the
arbitrator
found
they
did
not
have
to
move.
the
arbitrator
found
that
the
orange
book,
for
example,
restricted
the...
prohibited
the
transfer
of
work
and
prohibited
transfer
of
employees
beyond
the
old
scl
property.
and
he
said,
well,
the
commission
says
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
carry
out
this
transaction,
and
this
is
an
approved
transaction
so
we'll
move
the
work,
but
we
don't
have
to
move
the
employees.
and
the
commission
turns
right
around
and
says,
oh,
that's
egregious
error,
because
that
places
this
in
conflict
with
our
order,
our
5-year-old
merger
order
which
didn't
say
anything
about
the
raceland,
way
cross
shops
at
all
and
couldn't
have.
nobody
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
in
those
days.
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
extended
the
term
transaction...
approved
transaction...
to
every
single
thing
that
the
carrier
wants
to
carry
out
as
a
result
of
the
transaction.
and
that's
what
the
protection
is
there
for:
to
protect
employees--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
your
honor,
there
would...
something
would
happen
and
what
would
happen--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--well,
it
might
take
awhile
but
it
would
happen,
and
that
would
be
that
at
the
end
of
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
they
could
put
whatever
they
wanted
into
effect.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
they
could
put
whatever
they
wanted
into
effect.
and
right
now
the
emergency
board
is
hearing
cases
which
contains
the
railroad's
position
that
they
want
this
authority
to
make
these
moves.
they
don't
have
it.
they
want
it.
they've
placed
it
before
the
emergency
board
as
their
bargaining
proposition
under
section
6.
their--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
i
think--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it's
not
my
position
because
if
you
had
a
contract,
i
would
judge,
that
was
directly
opposed
to
an
order
of
the
commission,
you
could
override
the
contract
as
the
court
said
the
congress
could
do
in
l&n
against
motley
when
they
outlawed
passes.
but
you
can't...
you
wouldn't
outlaw
the
obligation...
there
is
in
our
contractual
obligation
that
obviously
the
other
party
paid
for.
the
railroad
is
not
going
to
give
that
sort
of
a
benefit
away.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
there's
an
obligation...
a
contract
obligation
as
this
court
said
in
l&n
against
motley...
that
they
might
not...
they
might
take
away
specific
performance,
but
they
just
can't
wipe
out
all--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--they
would
have
to
go
back
and
make
that
determination--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--well,
you
have
to
look
at...
11347
requires
two
things
it
seems
to
me.
it
requires
the
things
that
mr.
berlin
was
saying...
the
compensation,
the
6
years'
protection
and
money...
but
it
also
expressly
says
preservation
of
wages,
rules,
and
working
conditions.
preservation
of
collective
bargaining
and
collective
bargaining
agreement
rights.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it
can.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
not
without
compensation,
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
think
there's
a
constitutional
difference--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--if
it
will
sell
[inaudible]
so
sure.
that's
true.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it
is
our
position
rather
that
it
is
the
overall
view
of
congress
in
regulating
rail
transportation
was
to
ensure
the
adequate,
safe,
efficient,
and
uninterrupted
flow
of
interstate
commerce
by
rail
and
to
accomplish
that,
the
congress
enacted
three
basic
statutes
and
a
number
of
ancillary
statutes.
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
railway
labor
act,
and
the
federal
railroad
safety
act.
and
the...
as
this
court
said
in
schwabacher,
the
interstate
commerce
act
governs
issuance
of
securities,
car
supply,
joint
use
of
terminals,
abandonments,
and
so
forth,
and
also
governs
all
financial
transactions
governing
combinations
of
railroads.
its
only
relationship
to
employees
is
to
consider
their
interests
in
reaching
public
interest
findings
and
to
impose
minimum
standards
to
protect
employees
against
the
effects
of
its
orders.
the
second
element,
the
railway
labor
act,
as
this
court
noted,
was
a
complementary
regime
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
you
noted
that
in
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie.
and
this
act
governs
labor
relations.
it
governs
the
making
and
maintaining
of
agreements
effecting
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
working
conditions.
and
section
7
first
to
the
railway
labor
act
provides
that
if
there
is
a
controversy
regarding
those
matters
and
a
party
refuses
to
submit
that
to
arbitration,
he
shall
not
be
construed...
it
shall
not
be
construed
as
a
violation
of
any
legal
obligation
imposed
upon
such
party
by
the
terms
of
this
act
or
otherwise.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
commission
says
the
employees
must
do
now.
they
must
submit
their
contracts
to
arbitration,
changes
in
their
contracts
to
arbitration.
elimination
of
their
contracts
and
their
right
to
representation
to
arbitration.
the
third
part
of
these...
of
this
tripartite
statutory
arrangement
is
the
safety
act,
administered
by
the
federal
railroad
administration.
now,
the
petitioners
and
the
federal
respondents
stressed
the
exclusive
and
plenary
nature
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
it
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
and
so
it
is,
but
so
is
the
railway
labor
act
and
so
is
the
safety
act
in
their
specific
spheres
of
governance.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
any
state
law
that
intrudes
upon
that
exclusive
sphere
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
preempted
by
the
supremacy
clause
as
implemented
by
11341.
and
that
was
the
situation
in
schwabacher,
where
this
court
held
the
state
law
chartering
the
railroad
and
was
preempted
to
the
extent
it
conflicted
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
because
congress
had
occupied
the
field
by
giving
complete
control
of
the
capital
structure
of
railroads
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
just
as
the
railway
labor
act
is
supreme,
plenary,
and
exclusive
in
the
governance
of
the
making
and
maintaining
of
agreements
affecting
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
working
conditions.
now
the
impact
of
these
statutes
do
overlap,
and
when
they
do
they
must
be
accommodated,
giving
as
full
effect
as
possible
to
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
each.
for
example,
the
safety
laws
certainly
impact.
they're
expensive.
they
impact
upon
the
efficiency
of
railroads,
the
flexibility
of
railroads.
the
railway
labor
act
does
the
same
thing.
but
congress
says
each
of
those
things...
each
of
those
statutes
are
necessary
in
a
public
interest.
there
has
never
been
before
1983
a
court
or
of
the
commission
or
an
arbitrator
ever
to
hold
that
any
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
or
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
be
in
conflict
with
any
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
an
icc
order.
it's
never
happened,
but
in
1983,
the
commission,
in
the
r.g.w.
case,
held
that
conflict
existed,
and
in
1985
it
held
that,
by
virtue
of
11341,
its
orders
and
not
the
railway
labor
act
or
labor
contracts
governed
employee/management
relations
in
connection
with
an
approved
transaction.
and
by
an
approved
transaction
the
commission
meant
that
any
action
made
operationally
or
economically
feasible
or
desirable
by
the
merger.
in
other
words,
any
result
of
the
merger.
the
commission
made
no
attempt
at
accommodation
of
the
two
statutes
at
all
or
the
separate
complementary
purposes,
not
did
it
even
acknowledge
that
prior
to
1983,
no
conflict
had
ever
been
held
to
exist.
the
commission
just
invaded
the
railway
labor
act's
sphere
of
governance,
declared
the
existence
of
a
conflict,
and
proclaimed
itself
the
winner.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
we're
not
and
they
never
were
and
they
never
had
been,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
what
they
meant
was
they
could
abolish
jobs,
could
always
abolish
jobs,
cut
back
your
work
forces--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no.
no,
those
were
never
changed
by
these
agreements.
but
they
were
changed
by
agreement.
they
were
never
changed
by
statute...
by
requirement
of
the
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
prior
to
1983,
we
didn't
even
reach
the
question
of
contracts.
the
protective
arrangements,
if
you
look
at
the
protective
arrangements
in
all
the
agreements,
they
don't
provide
for
any
compensation
for
loss
of
contracts
rights.
they
provide
for
compensation
for
loss
of
jobs,
for
being
required
to
transfer,
and
so
forth.
and
this
was
all
done
by
agreement.
and
agreements
were
always
made.
i
don't
recall
in
40
years
of
practice
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
the
railway
labor
act
that
there
was
ever
not
an
agreement
as
a
result
of
a
merger.
there
were
a
number
of
agreements...
a
number
of
mergers
that
took
place
and
are
still
in
existence
in
which
there
are
different
agreements
on
different
sections
of
the
railroad,
like
the
burlington
northern,
because
they
never
got
together
and
put
all
of
the
agreements
together,
but
they
set
it
up
as
divisions.
but
i
don't
recall
anytime--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--no,
it
doesn't
mean
that.
if
you
have
a
contractual
right
to
transfer
him,
you
can
transfer
him,
give
him
seniority
anywhere,
and
he's
got
to
exercise
that
seniority
or
he
gets
no
protection.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that's
exactly
right.
as
in
the
original
language
of
52(f),
the
third
sentence
says,
notwithstanding
the
foregoing,
the
parties
may
reach
whatever
reasonable
agreement
they
wish.
and
that
has
always
been
the
case.
now
the...
because
they
have
taken
over
an
area...
this
is
a
little
unusual.
it's
not
like
schwabacher,
it's
not
like
any
of
the
cases
that
i've
read...
daniel...
the
daniel
case,
seaboard
case
or
any
of
those,
because
here
there
is
a
direct
invasion
of
another
complementary
regime
which
congress
designed
to
govern
rail
transportation
in
the
united
states.
it's
a
direct
invasion
of
that.
there's
never
been
any
conflict
before.
the
commission
declared
the
conflict,
created
the
conflict,
and
then
said,
we
win.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
done
explicitly.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
think
all...
you
can
set
aside
all
other
law,
but
this
you
had
to
find
first
of
all
it
seems
to
me
an
explicit
conflict.
there
has
to
be
some...
no
chance
at
accommodation.
here,
there
is
accommodation.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
not
with
any
federal
law,
your
honor.
no,
it
was
a
conflict
with
state
law.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it
preempted
that,
yes.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
because
where
congress
has
enacted
complementary
regimes
of
law
to
govern
the
same
subject
matter,
such
as
rail
transportation
in
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me
that
before
one
of
those
can
be
interpreted
to
supersede
or
preempt
the
other,
there
should
be...
it
should
be
a
very
clear
conflict
and
no
possible
way
of
accommodating
and
allowing
both
of
those
laws
to
proceed.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the...
it's
only
exempt
insofar
as
necessary
to
carry
out
an
order
as
conditioned.
and
the
condition
is
11347
and
11347
says
preserve
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
collective
bargaining
rights.
i
don't
see
how
anyone
can
get
out
of
that
circle.
it's
there.
you
can't
ignore
it.
if
you're
going
to
determine--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
the
railway...
i'm
saying
that
the
railway
labor
act
as
a
separate
regime
is
not
invaded...
cannot
be
invaded
or
should
not
be
invaded
by
11341
unless
there's
an
absolute
conflict
that
can't
be
avoided.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
but
at
the
same
time
if
you're
going
to
say
that,
yes,
you
can
read
11341
that
way,
then
you
have
to
go
to
11347
because
11340
exempts
only
those
carriers
in
carrying
out
transactions
as
conditioned.
they
have
to
carrying
them
out
as
conditioned.
and
one
of
the
conditions
is
a
minimum
level
of
preserving
all
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
11347
says--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--section
11347,
your
honor,
says
that
they
must...
that
the
commission
must
impose
as
a
minimum
level
of
protection
the
protections
that
were
imposed
by
the
secretary
of
labor
for
the
protection
of
employees
in
the
amtrak
case,
when
amtrak
was
created.
and
you
go
to
that
statute
and
you
find
in
that
statute
the
precise
sections
2
and
3
of
the
new
york
dock
conditions,
which
the
commission
just
adopted,
not
adapted,
by
adopted
from
the
secretary
and
put
them
in,
and
those
become
the
requirements
of
law.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
they
say...
section
2
says
they
must
be...
preserve
all
collective
bargaining
and
collective
bargaining
rights,
privileges
and
benefits.
and
section
3
says
you
must
preserve...
no
employee
shall
lose
any
protective
agreement
like
the
orange
book,
and
he
has
the
right
to
elect
between
his
protective
agreement
and
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
commission.
and
that
if
he
picks
one,
when
that
one
expires
he
can
then
go
to
other
one.
that's
what
section
3
says.
the
commission
doesn't
even
mention
that
and
wipes
out
the
orange
book.
so
it's
a...
it
does...
we
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
as
we've
pointed
out
at...
i
think
you'll
find
that
on...
11347
is
on
5a
and
then
the
new
york
dock
conditions
is
sections
2
and
3...
or
[inaudible].
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no.
no,
your
honor,
that
covers
the
period
for
6
years
from
the
date
the
employee
is
affected.
the
employee
could
be
affected
3,
4,
5,
6
years
later.
and
from
the
date
of
his
adverse
effect,
then
he
is
protected
for
6
years
forward
of
that
date.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
the
first
part
of
what,
your
honor?
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
11347
is...
we've
printed
it
out
on
page
4a
of
our
appendix.
on
a
rail
carrier
involved
in
a
transaction
which...
for
approval,
which
is
sought
under
11344,
the
icc
shall
require
the
carrier
to
provide
a
fair
arrangement
at
least
as
protective
of
the
interest
of
employees
who
are
affected
by
the
transaction
as
the
terms
imposed
under
this
section
before
february
5,
1976.
that
was
the
old
new
orleans
conditions
which
were
the
washington
agreement
upon
which
it
was
superimposed
for
the
first
4
years
oklahoma
conditions,
and
that
was
because
the
oklahoma--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--the
problem
is...
the
commission
acted
in
this
case
in
1980,
but
here
it
says
you
not
only
have
to
impose...
the
conditions
that
were
imposed
before
february
5,
but
the
terms
established
under
405
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act.
and
that's
what
we
were
talking
about
a
moment
ago.
the
terms
established
under
405
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act
are...
as
set
forth
in
sections
2
and
3
of
the
new
york
dock
condition.
i
mean,
that's
what
this
entire
case
is
about,
that--
one
of
the
conditions
is
preserve
collective
bargaining
right
and
collective
bargaining
agreement
rights,
and
that's
what
they
didn't
do
here.
that's
what
they...
that's
what
they
simply...
they
simply
wiped
out.
the
employees,
for
example,
the
atda...
the
employees
represented
by
the
atda,
the
american
train
dispatchers
association,
on
the
norfolk
and
western
railroad,
they
were
required
to
go
to
another
railroad
controlled
by
norfolk
southern,
which
was
the
southern
railroad.
and
when
they
went
to
the
southern
railroad,
when
they
got
there,
they
no
longer
had
representation
under
their...
under
the
law...
under
the
statute,
and
they
no
longer
had
a
contract.
no
contract
protection.
now,
they
may
think...
someone
might
say,
well,
they
were
much
better
off.
well,
maybe
they
were
and
maybe
they
weren't.
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
is
that
they
didn't
have
any
contract
protection
anymore
and
they
didn't
have
any
representation
anymore.
and
the
fellows
at
way
cross
they
were
sent
from
the
old
scl
railroad
in
way
cross,
georgia,
up
to
raceland,
a
commonly
controlled
csx-controlled
railroad,
another
railroad.
these
aren't
the
same
railroads.
these
are
separate
railroads
under
common
control.
csx
controlled
both
railroads
that...
you
go
there.
when
they
go
there,
they
were
under
a
different
contract
with
different
rules
and
different
working
conditions.
and
half
of
them
have
this
contract
right
which
the
arbitrator
found
required
them
to
stay
in...
on
scl
property
for
life,
lifetime
employment
or
lifetime
full
compensation
in
lieu
of
employment.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
or
prohibited
them
from
moving.
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke
myself.
prohibit
them
from
moving.
they
could
stay
there
with
lifetime
employment
or
lifetime
protection,
compensation...
full
compensation
in
lieu
of
employment,
and
the
commission
now
says
to
them,
not
any
more.
if
you
stay
there,
you're
going
to
get
nothing.
if
you
want
that
lifetime
protection,
move
to
raceland.
you've
got
to
get
off
the
scl
property.
that's
the
contract
violation
and
for
which
they
would
get
nothing.
and
the
commission
has
said--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--well,
only
if...
no,
if
they
moved.
the
commission
said
that
if
they
moved,
the
carriers
said
that
they
would
give
them
a
lifetime
protection
if
they
moved.
but
of
course
they
could
say
next
week,
let's
move
again.
it
became
sort
of
worthless.
but
nevertheless,
if
they
stayed,
which
they
had
the
right
to
do
according
to
the
arbitrator,
who
interpreted
the
agreement.
if
they
stayed
there,
then
they
got
no
protection
at
all
of
any
kind.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
never
reached--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--but
all...
my
point
is
here
that
if
you
say
that
11341,
or
lean
to
the
proposition
that
11341
supersedes
contracts
or
overrides
contracts,
then
you
have
to
look
at
11347,
because
11347...
11341
only
extends
protections
or
exemptions
to
those
carriers.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
you
could
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
and
unfortunately
that,
we
think,
would
be
a
terribly
unjust
thing
to
do
in
these
cases,
simply
because
these
people
have
been
deprived
of
these
rights
for
5
years,
8
years,
10
years.
the
commission
is...
the
commission
is
now
interpreting
contracts,
interpreting
collective
bargaining
agreements.
i
cited
a
couple
in
a
couple
of
footnotes.
where
they're
now
interpreting
agreements
to
see
if
they
violate
the
commission
orders
or
whether
the
orders
violate
the
contract.
that's
unheard
of.
they
are
now
doing
what
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
has
exclusive
authority
to
do.
they've
never
done
that
before.
it's
never...
no
contract
has
ever
been
held
or
eliminated
or
modified
by
any
order
including
the
only
three
cases
they
ever
cite,
which
is
a
'63
eighth
circuit
case
which
upheld
a
contract;
a
burlington
northern
case
in
'75
with
their
supervisors,
which
also
upheld
the
contract;
and
the
statement
that
the
icc
made
in
1974
when
the
trustee
of
the
erie-lackawanna
wanted
to
get
out
from
under
a
contract.
he
wanted
to
get
out
from
under
the
contract.
he
went
back
to
the
commission
and
said,
we
want
out
from
under
this
attrition
agreement,
and
we
came
in
and
opposed
it
on
two
grounds
and
fortunately
i
raised
the
question.
one
was
that
you
don't
have
authority
to
do
that,
icc,
and
the
other
was
you
shouldn't
do
it
anyway
because
they
haven't
approved
their
case.
and
the
icc
said,
well,
yeah,
we
got
the
authority
because
our
'63
court
of
appeals
said
we
did.
but
we're
not
going
to
exercise
that
authority
because
they
didn't
make
their
case.
so
there's
never
been
a
contract
upset
until
now,
until
the
commission,
who
has
found
this
conflict
and
who
started
upsetting
contracts.
and,
your
honors,
we
don't
want
to
go
back
and
start
all
over
again
on
this
on
another
4
years.
there
might
not
be
enough
of
the
employees
left
to
bother
with.
and
besides
that,
the
commission
has
recognized...
in
this
remand
decision,
they
recognized
that
since
their
decision
this
has
caused
such
enormous
deterioration
in
the
labor/management
relations
in
this
industry
and
it
has.
and
that
is
one
of
things
that
they're
supposed
to
avoid
and
this
court
said
in
lowden
that
you
should
avoid
if
possible.
and
they
have
created
this
terrible
upset
among
these
employees
and
management.
because
management
likes
it.
there's
no
bargaining
anymore.
why
should
they
bargain
with
us
anymore?
all
they
have
to
do
is
say,
the
commission
says
this
consolidation
10
years
down
the
road
has
been
authorized.
and
if
you
have
a
consolidation
you've
got
to
move
from
a
to
b,
naturally.
that's
by
definition.
so
it's
necessary.
it's
an
authorized,
necessary
consolidation.
the
contracts
go
out
the
window
and
everything
is
moved.
there's
no
way
to
prove
that
isn't
necessary.
it
is
by
definition
necessary
to
go
from
a
to
b
if
you're
going
to
consolidate
a
with
b.
and
that's
the
great
problem
that
we
face,
and
we
think
that
what
they
have
done
is
they've
taken
11347,
which
is
clearly...
no
question
it
was
designed
as
a
shield
to
protect
employee
rights
against
icc
orders,
convert
it
into
a
sword,
and
cut
out
their
contract
rights.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
your
honors,
i
conclude
my
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
