mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
either
way
is
fine,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
important
question
of
federal
law.
the
provision
in
issue
is
a
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
49
u.s.c.,
section
11341(a).
that
section
applies
to
a
railroad
participating
in
a
consolidation
that
has
been
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
provides
that
such
a
railroad
is
exempt
from
all
other
law
to
the
extent
necessary
to
let
the
railroad
carry
out
its
consolidation.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
this
exemption
protects
the
railroad
from
claims
that
are
based
on
the
railroad's
contracts
and
are
asserted
exclusively
under
federal
law.
the
particular
contracts
involved
here
are
labor
agreements,
and
the
particular
law
is
the
railway
labor
act.
since
1920
in
a
series
of
statutes,
congress
has
encouraged
the
nation's
railroads
to
merge
and
consolidate
under
the
supervision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
to
this
end,
congress
has
given
the
icc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
matters
with
in
its
authority
and
given
to
railroads
participating
in
approved
consolidations
a
broad
exemption
from
other
legal
restraints.
this
exemption
originated
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
was
reenacted
in
1933,
reenacted
in
1940,
and
took
its
present
form
in
1978
when
it
was
recodified
without
substantive
change.
csx
transportation
and
norfolk
southern
are
two
of
today's
large
railroad
systems.
each
system
was
formed
when
two
previously
separate
railroad
systems
were
placed
under
common
control
with
icc
approval.
on
receipt
of
that
approval,
these
railroads
set
out
to
achieve
the
traditional
purposes
of
mergers
and
consolidations,
which
include
the
realization
of
greater
economies
and
efficiencies
through
the
combination
of
facilities,
the
elimination
of
redundant
facilities,
the
bringing
control
of
various
operations
into
single
locations,
and
otherwise
taking
advantage
of
economies
of
scale
that
the
consolidations
make
possible.
now
as
part
of
carrying
out
their
consolidations,
csx
transportation
and
norfolk
southern
each
sought
to
transfer
work
from
one
of
their
previously
separate
properties
to
the
other.
csx
transportation
had
a
freight
car
heavy
repair
shop
at
way
cross,
georgia
and
another,
same
kind
of
shop,
at
raceland,
kentucky.
csxt
didn't
need
to
retain
both
shops,
and
the
facility
at
raceland
was
larger
and
more
modern
and
it
had
substantial
excess
capacity.
therefore,
csxt
proposed
to
bring
to
raceland
the
freight
heavy
repair
work
that
was
previously
done
at
way
cross.
norfolk
southern
proposed
to
make
a
slightly
different
kind
of
operational
change.
norfolk
southern
operates
more
than
2,000
locomotives.
previously
the
distribution
of
locomotives...
their
assignment
to
specific
trains
and
facilities...
was
handled
separately
on
each
of
norfolk
southern's
two
constituent
railroads.
now,
norfolk
southern
proposed
to
bring
all
of
this
work
to
one
location
where
one
of
the
railroads
would
administer
the
work
for
the
whole
norfolk
southern
system.
the
unions
in
each
case
resisted
the
railroad's
proposed
changes
contending
that
these
changes
were
inconsistent
with
provisions
of
their
existing
labor
agreements
and
also
that
the
railway
labor
act
gave
the
unions
the
right
to
insist
that
the
changes
not
be
made
until
either
the
unions
had
agreed
to
them
or
the
railroads
had
exhausted
the
railway
labor
act's
virtually
endless
process
for
the
negotiation
of
changes
to
existing
agreements.
the
icc
held
that
the
railroad's
proposed
changes
were
exempt
by
virtue
of
section
11341(a)
from
claims
asserted
under
the
railway
labor
act,
including
claims
based
on
labor
agreements.
the
commission
found
that
the
railroad's
actions
were
subject
to
the
processes
of
the
icc's
employee
protective
conditions,
which
had
been
imposed
on
both
consolidations
as
required
by
a
different
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
section
11347.
the
protective
conditions
confer
on
employee
a
generous
array
of
compensatory
benefits
including
a
guarantee
of
wage
protection
for
as
long
as
6
years
if
they
are
affected
by
the
consolidation.
and
the
protective
conditions
also
establish
a
procedure
for
the
negotiation
and,
if
necessary,
arbitration
of
an
agreement
to
govern
the
manner
in
which
a
railroad
may
implement
its
approved
consolidation
if
the
implementation
will
cause
employees
to
be
dismissed
or
displaced
or
will
require
a
rearrangement
of
the
work
force.
and
it
was
that
procedure
that
was
followed
in
these
cases
and
which
led
to
the
icc's
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
the
exemption
from
all
other
law
reaches
only
positive
legislative
enactments
and
is
ineffective
against
claims
asserted
under
contracts.
the
court
reasoned
that
because
labor
agreements
are
a
form
of
contract,
the
statutory
exemption
does
not
apply
to
them
and
to
the
claims
asserted
by
the
unions
in
these
cases.
now
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
surely
incorrect.
contractual
obligations
are
binding
only
because
of
the
law
and
an
exemption
from
law
bars
enforcement
of
those
obligations.
this
court
held
in
1948
in
schwabacher
that
the
statutory
exemption
covers
claims
based
on
contracts.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
both
transfers
of
work,
justice
stevens,
were
part
of...
first
part
of
carrying
out
the
approved
transaction.
so
the
person
carrying
out
the
transaction
in
each
case
was
the
railroads.
an
exemption
from
claims
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--that's
not
how
we
put
it,
justice
stevens.
the
statute
requires
that
the
railroad
be
carrying
out
its
approved
transaction...
that
is,
the
consolidation
of
the
railroads...
and
that
the
exemption
then
be
necessary
to
let
that
carrying
out
proceed,
so
that
it
is
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--no,
justice
stevens,
the
exemption
does
not
reach
to
any
conceivable
amalgamation
in
the
future.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--in
this
case,
the
railroads
were
carrying
out
the
traditional
purposes,
that
is,
the
combining
of
extra
facilities
or
the
centralization
of
control.
the
court
recognized
many
years
ago
in
texas
v.
united
states
in
1934
that
the
broad
congressional
purpose
in
giving
exclusive
authority
to
the
icc
over
consolidations
requires
that
the
scope
of
the
exemption
be
interpreted
broadly
as
that
purpose.
now,
here
the
railroads
were
doing
what
are
paradigmatic
changes
in
their
work
force.
the
combination
of
two
facilities--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--it
covers
a
great
many
such
changes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
these
are
the
easy
cases,
justice
stevens.
i
don't
mean
to
duck
the
question,
but
i
want
to
start
with
my--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
oh,
certainly,
and
that
situation
occurred
for
some
years,
but
it
was...
it
is
always
anticipated
when
complex
entities
such
as
these
railroad
systems
engage
in
mergers
and
other
consolidations
that
there
will
over
time
be
operational
changes
to
realize
the
efficiencies
and
economies
that
congress
wants
the
railroads
to
achieve
under
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--such
a
situation
could
certainly
be
within
the
reach
of
the
exemption.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
yes.
but
let
me
say
that
the
working
out
of
this
exemption
before
we
can
get
to
a
situation
where
we
say
everything
may
be...
the
exemption
may
sweep
so
broadly
that
virtually
all
contracts
could
be
covered
by
it.
surely
that
is
too
broad
a
statement
of
what
this
exemption
does.
before
an
action
of
a
railroad...
combined
railroad...
is
going
to
enjoy
the
protection
of
the
exemption,
that
action
first
must
be
a
part
of...
they
must
encompassed
within
the
approved
consolidation
in
the
first
instance.
second,
the
railroad
must
be
carrying
out
what
was
approved,
and
third,
the
exemption
must
be
necessary
to
the
carrying
out.
now,
one
qualification
that
whenever
we
talk
about
hypotheticals
involving
employees
is
that
the
labor
protective
conditions
provide
compensation
for
employees
who
are
affected.
chief
executive
officer
would
not
enjoy
that.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
yes,
it
would.
but
congress
has
shown
by
providing
a
compensatory
mechanism
in
the
labor
protective
conditions
which
it
requires
the
icc
to
impose
on
these
transactions
that
the
statutory
exemption
is
going
to
affect
employees.
the
court
recognized
in
lowden
in
1939
that
consolidations
inevitably
will
cause
employees
to
lose
their
jobs,
suffer
reductions
in
their
wages,
and
lose
their
seniority
rights
which
are
defined
by
contracts.
and
when
that
happens
the
employees
are
going
to
be
compensated.
now,
the
enactment
of
the
protective
conditions
legislation
for
the
first
time
in
1940
was
part
of
a
major
legislative
review
of
the
icc's
authority
and
the
scope
of
the
exemption
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
when
congress
first
put
that
statutory
foundation
under
labor
protection
which
the
icc
had
just
begun...
recently
begun
at
that
time...
putting
into
effect
on
its
own,
congress
looked
at
the
entire
range
of
questions
that
bear
on
this
issue.
for
example,
congress
had
to
decide
whether
to
reenact
the
general
exemption
from
all
other
legal
restraints,
as
it
was
then
phrased
in
the
law.
and
congress
did
so.
congress
passed
up
at
the
time
the
opportunity
that
was
suggested
to
it
to
reenact
a
temporary
measure
that
had
been
in
effect
in
title
i
of
the
emergency
railroad
transportation
act
of
1933
that
prevented
these
things.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
the...
justice
stevens
in
his
concurrence
in
the
ble
case
in
1986
suggested
that
any
tribunal
that
is
called
upon
to
assess
whether
a
competing
claim
may
be
asserted
may
be
the
one
called
upon,
may
have
to
determine
whether
the
exemption
is
necessary
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
transaction.
in
this
case,
however,
it
comes
up,
mr.
chief
justice,
through
the
actual
procedures
of
the
protective
conditions
which
congress
has
directed
be
put
into
place.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
no,
it
did
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
issue
of
carrying
out
and
it
didn't
reach
the
issue
of
necessity.
all
the
court
of
appeals
held
is
that
claims
based
on
labor
agreements
may
never
come
within
the
scope
of
the
statutory
exemption.
that's
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--even
assuming
that
were
the
case,
that's
right.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
rely
on
its
conclusion
that
the
exemption
from
all
other
law
pertained
only
to
positive
statutory
enactments.
the
court
cut
a
wedge
through
the
middle
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
distinguished
between
contract
claims,
which
is
what
it...
what
the
court
perceived
to
be
asserted
in
this
case
and
other
types
of
claims
that
might
be
brought
under
the
railway
labor
act
or
rest
on
the
railway
labor
act.
we
submit
and
have
discussed
our
briefs
that
that
distinction
is
illusory,
that
claims
arising
under
labor
agreements
are
only
assertable
because
of
the
railway
labor
act
as
labor
agreements
in
the
railroad
industry
are
creatures
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
contracts
carry
out
the
rla
commands,
and
it's
only
the
rla
that
makes
them
enforceable.
and
so
we
think
that
one
thing
this
court
should
do
as
it
visits
the
issue
is
hold
that
the
exemption
reaches
claims
assert...
that
it
may
reach
claims
asserted
under
labor
agreements,
and
as
part
of
that,
that
it
reaches
claims
asserted
under
the
railway
labor
act.
that
is,
there's
no
way
to
just
sever
this
out
and
say
that's
as
far
as
the
case
should
go.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
well,
justice
white,
one
of
the
difficulties
is
in
pinning
down
precisely
what
the
specific
claims
were
in
both
cases.
in
the
csx
case,
the
employees
on
the
seaboard
property,
the
property
in
which
that
way
cross
shop
was
located,
had
what
is
called
the
orange
book
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
had
been
negotiated
in
connection
with
an
earlier
merger
that
resulted
in
that
seaboard
railroad.
they
contended
that
the
orange
book
contractually
barred
the
merged
railroad
from
moving
work...
their
work...
from
raceland...
from
way
cross,
georgia,
where
it
was
covered
by
the
orange
book
to
the
property
at
raceland,
kentucky,
which
was
not
in
that
original
orange
book
merger.
so
they
said
that
the
orange
book
was
a
bar
itself,
a
contractual
bar.
by
way
of
example
in
the
norfolk
southern
case
involving
the
transfer
of
employees
who
perform
work
known
as
distribution
of
locomotive
power,
the
employees
were
to
be
moved...
or
the
work
was
to
be
moved
and
employees
given
an
opportunity
to
follow
it
from
a
property
where
one
union
had
a
contract
that
covered
that
work
to
the
other
property
where
the
work
was
done
by
management
officers
of
the
other
company.
and
the
employees
in
that
case
contended
that
their
agreement
barred
the
transfer,
although
the
specifics
were
always
unclear
to
us,
and
also
that
before
the
transfer
could
be
accomplished,
the
railroad
had
to
negotiate
with
the
union
over
the
terms
of
the
transfer.
that
is
that
the
railway
labor
act
conferred
on
their
employees
through
their
union
the
right
to
insist
on
negotiation
before
such
a
change
could
be
made.
below,
the
railroads
thought
they
were
at
issue
over
the
question
of
claims
based
on
the
railway
labor
act,
encompassing
but
broader
than
claims
simply
asserted
on
specific
labor
agreements.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
the
unions
contended
that
the
minor...
the
major
dispute
rules
applied.
that
is
that
a
change...
a
unilateral
change
in
working
conditions
was
under
way
and
that
they
had
the
right
to
insist
on
the
bargaining
process
be
followed.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
again--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--justice
scalia,
the
question
that
the
court
took
on
certiorari
is
whether
the
exemption
applies
to
claims
based
on
agreements
that
are
asserted
under
federal
law.
now
we
would
be
quite
content,
i
assure
you--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
--yes,
such
a
claim,
justice
scalia,
is
surely
within
the
scope
of
the
exemption.
the
court
as
much
as
said
so
in
schwabacher.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
no,
that's
right.
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
justice
kennedy,
any
action
that
the...
the
answer
is
yes.
if
employees
are
to
be
affected,
that
is,
displaced
or
dismissed
or
somehow
have
their
work
arrangements
changed,
even
if
the
statutory
exemption
does
apply
as
we
say
it
does,
those
employees
receive
the
compensatory
and
procedural
protections
of
the
protective
conditions
that
are
imposed
by
the
icc
under
section
11347.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
we
do
not
depend
on
the
protective
conditions
to
sustain
our
reading
of
the
exemption.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
commission...
well,
first
the
statutory
exemption
predates
the
protective
conditions
by
almost
4
years...
40
years...
statutorially
and
almost
that
much
before
the
icc
began
imposing
them
on
its
own
authority.
the...
but
the
icc
said
when
it
heard
these
cases
on
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
rendered
a
decision
under
the
protective
conditions
that
its
decision
was...
in
deciding
it
was
bound
to
apply
the
reading
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
to
11341(a)'s
exemption
provision.
and
in
a
later
decision
last
summer,
the
icc
has
made
clear
that
if
this
court
reverses
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
exemption,
the
icc
will
have
to
revisit
its
decision
on
the
protective
conditions.
so
the
icc
sees
11347's
scope
as
dependent,
at
least
in
part,
on
whether
there
is
an
exemption
out
there.
and
we
say
that
the...
that
that's
clearly
right,
that
the
congressional
action
most
recently
in
1976
relating
to
employee
protection,
was
done
against
the
background
of
56
years
of
this
preexisting
exemption
and
it
bears
that
way,
rather
than
the
other.
the
availability
of
the
protective
conditions
and
their
compensation
and
procedural
protection
is
important
in
that
recognizes
the
congressional
attention
to
the
interests
of
employees
but
by
no
means
necessary
to
the
existence
of
the
exemption.

that...
that's
right.
i
think
it's
part
of
the
same
statute
and
congress
expects
the
icc
and
the
railroads
to
comply
with
it
even
in
exempt
situations.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
berlin
i
think
it's
not,
but
even
it
were,
an
exemption
from
it
would
never
be
necessary
because
congress
has
said
that.
