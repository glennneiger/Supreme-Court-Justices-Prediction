mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
11341(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
exempts
a
participant
in
a
commission-approved
transaction
from
its
contractual
obligations.
we
submit
that
section
11341(a)
does
exactly
that.
we
based
our
conclusion
squarely
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
section
11341(a)
states
that
a
carrier
participating
in
an
approved
transaction
is
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
from
all
other
law
as
necessary
to
carry
out
the
transaction.
that
exemption
is
easily
sufficient
to
embrace
those
laws
governing
contractual
obligations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
difficult
proposition.
the
reason
is
this.
contracts
derive
their
force
only
from
the
fact
that
they're
enforceable
through
law.
what
is
actually
being
exempted
here
is
the
enforcement
of
those
laws.
a
naked
promise
without
the
background
of
law
behind
it
would
not
be
subject
to
this
provision.
but
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
exemption
as
well.
now,
this
court
recognized
as
you
note
that
principle
in
schwabacher,
that
in
fact
contractual
obligations
are
subject
to
the
11341(a)
exemption.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
the
commission's
approval
of
a
railroad
merger
could
deprive
dissenting
shareholders
of
their
contract
rights
under
state
law.
the
same
is
true
in
this
case.
section
11341(a)
preempts
the
union's
rights--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--not
exactly,
your
honor.
i
think
the
question
there...
to
give
you
the
background
on
this
case.
the
dissenting
shareholders
argued
that
they're
entitled
to
accrued
dividends
under
the
corporate
charter
and
that
that
was
enforceable
through
michigan
law.
the
commission--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
and
the
court
held
that
the
commission
should
rule
on
that
issue
and
its
ruling
would
be
dispositive.
and
it's
noted,
for
example,
that
first
the
commission
must
consider
the
public
interest
in
approving
that
transaction--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what
it
would
effectively
do
is
prevent
them
from
enforcing
their
contractual
rights
under
state
law.
that
is
the
effect
of
the
exemption.
it
prevents
enforcement
of
law.
but
the
same
is
true
in
this
case.
as
i
said,
section
11341(a)
preempts
the
union's
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
the
extent
that
enforcement
of
those
rights
would
prevent
the
railroad
from
carrying
out
the
approved
transaction.
indeed
if
it
were
otherwise
many
of
these
transactions
could
simply
not
take
place.
now,
the
unions
do
not
quarrel
with
our
basic
position
as
section
11341(a)
can
preempt
the
enforcement
of
contractual
rights.
nor
do
they
quarrel
with
the
result
in
schwabacher.
instead
the
unions
argued
the
contract
in
this
case
should
be
treated
differently,
because
the
commission,
in
their
view,
has
no
authority
or
control
over
labor
matters.
now
there
are
two
fundamental
problems
with
this
position.
first,
the
union's
argument
is
to
whether
the
commission
has
authority,
control,
or
jurisdiction
over
labor
matters
are
beside
the
point.
section
11341(a)
by
its
terms
exempts
a
participant
in
a
commission-approved
transaction
from
all
law
to
the
extent
necessary
to
carry
out
the
transaction.
the
exemption
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
that
law.
second,
the
union's
assertion
is
simply
not
correct.
the
i...
the
interstate
commerce
act
requires
the
commission
to
consider
and
address
labor
matters
when
approving
a
proposed
merger.
indeed,
as
this
court
recognized
in
lowden
v.
the
united
states,
mergers
almost
invariably
affect
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
the
commission
must
consider
those
effects
when
evaluating
the
proposed
transaction.
moreover,
there
is
no
need
to
read
into
section
11341(a)
an
implied
exception
for
labor
contracts,
because
the
interstate
commerce
act
contains
other
provisions.
they
are
designed
specifically
to
protect
rail
labor
from
hardships
that
might
result
from
a
merger.
first,
as
i've
mentioned,
the
commission
must
consider
the
interests
of
rail
labor
when
deciding
whether
the
proposed
transaction
is
in
the
public
interest.
second,
the
commission
must
address
the
terms
of
the
merger
transaction--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
depends...
the
commission
looks
at
this
in
two
parts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
commission...
the
statute
provides
that
they
would
be
exempt
from
their
enforcement
of
those
contracts
to
the
extent
necessary
to
carry
out
the
transaction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
commission
will
look
at
this
in
two
steps.
first,
it
will
ask
whether
this
proposed
activity
of
the
railroad
is
a
part
of
the
approved
transaction.
this
is
essentially
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
transaction
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
contract...
you're
talking
about--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the...
it
was
a
finding
by
the
arbitrator
that
in
fact
the
transaction
did
contemplate--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--as
part
of
the
transaction,
no,
but
i
do
not
believe
that's
necessary
and
the
commission
does
not
believe
that
that's
necessary.
rather
they
look
to
whether
this
was
a
contemplated
activity
under
the
transaction.
once
it
makes
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there's
nothing...
this
again
is
a
matter
that
the
arbitrator
decided
in
this
case.
it's
not
that
the
question's
presented
squarely
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
my
view
of
your
hypothetical
is
that
this
would
be
submitted
to
the
appropriate
tribunal.
they
would
determine
first
whether
it
was
a
part
of
the
approved
transaction.
if
so,
the
next
question
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
the...
tribunal
is
going
to
make
that
determination
by
looking
at
the
terms
of
the
transaction,
implied
and
in
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
will
be
the
tribunal
that
has
been
asked
to
enforce
the
contract
lease
most
likely.
the
parties--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--new
york
state
court,
for
example.
they
would
examine
the
transaction
and
make
a
determination
whether
this
was
contemplated
under
the
transaction,
whether
it
was
implied
in
fact
in
the
transaction,
and
they'd
make
the
second
determination
of
whether
this
interferes
with
carrying
out
whether
the
enforcement
of
the
lease
interferes
with
the
carrying
out
of
that
particular
activity
under
the
transaction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
they
did
imply
they
found
it
implied
in
the
terms
of
the
transaction.
it
was
not
like
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
the
commission
did
affirm
that
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that
issue,
so
it's
not
part
of
this
case.
the
issue
before
this
case
is
the
interpretation--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
as
i
was
saying
the...
not
only
is
the
public
interest
considered
in
the
course...
the
labor
interests
considered
in
the
course
of
the
public
interest
evaluation
of
the
commission.
in
addition,
the
commission
must
add
to
the
terms
of
the
merger
special
provisions
that
are
specifically
designed
to
protect
rail
labor
for
dislocations
that
might
result
from
carrying
out
the
merger.
and
then
finally,
as
we've
talking
about,
section
11341's
exemption
applies
only
to
the
extent
that
is
necessary
to
permit
implementation
for
the
transaction.
in
some
the
expressed
terms
of
the
act
provide
ample
protection
for
rail
labor.
there's
simply
no
need
for
this
court
to
create
additional
protections
that
are
not
part
of
the
legislative
scheme.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
petitioners'
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
the
that
issue
in
this
case
is
the
construction
of
11341(a)
and
in
particular
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
"the
antitrust
laws
and
any
other
law.
"
the
unions
have
raised
at
great
length
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
section
11347.
that
is
an
issue
that
is
presently
before
the
commission
on
remand
in
this
case.
it
is
an
issue
that
will
be
addressed
after
this
court
addresses
this
issue
of
11341.
we
do
not
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
interpret
11347
in
this
proceeding.
in
fact,
it
would
be
quite
improvident
to
do
so.
beyond
that
the
unions
have
not
raised
any
issue
beyond
the...
that
reaches
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
here.
we
think
that
the
plain
language
controls
11341(a)
covers
all
law
including
all
laws
related
to
enforcement
of
contract.
thank
you.
