justice
scalia
mr.
berlin,
as
i
recall
your
brief,
you're
not
arguing,
although
i
guess
you'll
settle
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
it's
only
rla
contracts
that
are
superseded
by
this
legislation.
you
believe
that
any
contractual
commitment
is.
justice
scalia
well,
some
of
your
argumentation...
well,
i
forget
which
brief
and
which
of
your
co-petitioner...
which
brief
is
which...
but
one
of
them
makes
the
argument
that
of
course
if
there
is
a
commitment
to
bondholders
that
would
stand
in
the
way
of
a
merger,
that
would
be
overridden
by
the
icc's
action.
is
that
your
position?
justice
scalia
and
that's
not
an
rla
agreement?
justice
scalia
if
you
have
a
labor
contract
that...
would...
with
the
rail
unions
that
say
there
will
be
no
consolidations
of
facilities.
justice
scalia
then
the
icc
could
decree
mergers
until
the
cows
come
home
and
nothing
would
happen
except
that
technically
there
would
be
one
company
operating
inefficiently
instead
of
two.
justice
scalia
what
would
happen?
justice
scalia
at
the
end
of
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
scalia
but
it
is
your
position
that
all
a
railway
labor
union
has
to
do
is
put
in
its
contract
with
management
that
there
shall
be
no
consolidation
of
facilities
without
the
consent
of
the
union
and,
in
effect,
whatever
the
icc
decrees,
no
matter
how
specific
it
gets
for
that
matter
about
a
merger
or
a
consolidation,
it
will
not
be
effective
because
it
cannot
override
that
contractual
obligation.
justice
scalia
i
think
it
can
take
a
yes
or
no.
is
that
your
position
or
not?
justice
scalia
all
right.
why
not?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand.
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see,
so
what
you're
saying
is,
well,
the
new
company
would
be
permitted
to
merge
facilities
as
the
icc
has
said
but
they
will
have
to
pay
compensation
to
the
union
for
that.
justice
scalia
which
would
probably
be
compensation
in
the
amount
of
the
efficiency
that
they
were
trying
to
eliminate,
right?
i
mean
the
wages
of
all
of
the
people
who
would
have
otherwise
been
eliminated.
justice
scalia
well,
to
the
extent
that
that
governs,
i
don't
think
the
railroads
are
arguing
that
they
aren't
bound
by
that.
they're
just
arguing
about
whether
41
permits
them
to,
apart
from
the
guarantees
that
are
made
in
the
legislation,
override
a
contract.
and
your
position
is
that
if
the
labor
union
has
an
inefficiency
built
into
a
contract,
it
cannot
be
eliminated
by
the
icc.
justice
scalia
well,
not
without
compensation.
i--
justice
scalia
--okay,
you
want
to
say
it
can
be
eliminated
with
compensation.
i
regard
that
as
not
being
eliminable.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
could
buy
back
anything
from
the
unions.
i
mean,
management
can
go
in
and
say,
let's
eliminate
this
if
we'll
give
you
this
much
money.
justice
scalia
icc
for
that.
justice
scalia
mr.
mahoney,
can
i
ask
you
something
about
section
11347?
justice
scalia
i
had
assumed
that
the
reason
it
provides
that
the
arrangement
and
the
order
approving
the
transaction
must
require
that
the
employees
of
the
affected
rail
carrier
will
not
be
in
a
worse
position
related
to
their
employment
as
a
result
of
the
transaction
during
the
4
years
following
the
effective
date.
i
assumed
when
i
read
it
that
the
reason
for
that
was
without
it,
their
employment
rights
could
be
altered.
are
they
not
talking
about
contractual
rights
of
employment
there?
justice
scalia
what...
what--
justice
scalia
--even
if
you
had
a
contractual...
i
mean,
if
there
were
a
commitment
to
have
so
many
jobs
on
a
particular
run?
justice
scalia
no?
justice
scalia
i
see.
so
you
think
what
this
means
is
that
if
there
were
a,
let's
say,
a
station
master
who
would
have
served
at
a
particular
location,
even
though
he
could
contractually
have
been
transferred
but
in
fact
he
was
serving
where
he
lived,
this
provision
means
that
even
though
you
had
a
contractual
right
to
transfer
him,
you
won't...
you
won't
transfer
him
for
4
years?
justice
scalia
mr.
gallagher,
why
isn't
that
one
in
that
a
separate
section?
i
thought
this
case
just
involved
11341,
and
i
thought
the
court
below
held
that
there
simply
is
no
power
under
that
to
alter
the
contractual
arrangements.
justice
scalia
you're
making
the
argument
that
under
11347,
there
is
a
specific
preservation
of
those
contractual
arrangements.
that
may
be,
but
that
wasn't
what
the
court
below--
justice
scalia
--had
before
it.
justice
scalia
so
we
could
tell
the
court
of
appeals
below
you're
wrong
about
22341,
remand,
and
tell
them
to
consider
11347,
if
we
think
that
11341
says
nothing
about
not
impairing--
justice
scalia
--we
could
do
that.
