what
claims
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
had
to
be
overridden
here?
justice
white
was
this
a...
if
the
unions
had
had
their
way,
would
this
have
been
a
major
dispute
or
minor
dispute?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
well,
didn't
the
arbitration
committee
decide
that
this
shop
consolidation
was
actually
authorized
by
the
commission's
1980
order?
justice
white
well,
then
the
commission
affirmed
that.
justice
white
so
this
was
actually
contemplated
or
authorized
by
our
1980
order.
justice
white
well,
so
as
it
comes
to
us,
it
was
authorized?
justice
white
i
think
the
railroad
said
that
the...
is
it
their
position
that
the
protective
provisions
don't
apply
at
all
if
they
win?
i
thought
they...
the
protective
provisions
will
at
least
guarantee
6
months...
6
years
of
pay--
justice
white
--isn't
the
real
issue
whether
they
not
only
can
transfer
the
work,
but
transfer
the
employees
to
the
new
location?
justice
white
well,
it
was,
though.
there
was
an
issue
that
was--
justice
white
--the
first
part
of
my
question
was
do
you
understand
the
railroads
to
contend
that
the
protective
provisions
do
not
apply
in
the
sense
that
they
object
to
6
months...
6
years'
worth
of
pay?
justice
white
no,
they
do
not.
justice
white
no,
but
they
want
to
transfer...
they
want
to
transfer
the
employees
to
the
new
location
so
they
can
work.
justice
white
didn't
the
commission
say
that
the
promise
of
lifetime
employment
was
also
abrogated,
or
not?
