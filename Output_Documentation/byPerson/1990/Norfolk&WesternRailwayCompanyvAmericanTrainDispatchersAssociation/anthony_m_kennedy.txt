justice
kennedy
is
that
of
relevance
in
our
interpreting
the
scope
and
effect
of...
11341?
justice
kennedy
don't
we
have
to
interpret
the
act
according
to
its
whole
design,
all
of
its
sections?
and
what
i'm
getting
at
is
whether
or
not
we
shouldn't
really
have
the
commission's
interpretation
of
11347
in
front
of
us
in
order
to
make
this
determination.
justice
kennedy
is
the
reading
of
the
section
that
the
railroad
and
the
union
can
reach
an
agreement
with
respect
to
the
effects
of
the
merger
on
the
employees,
but
that
this
is
a
minimum
standard
that
the
icc
must
insist
upon.
justice
kennedy
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
kennedy
but
11347
doesn't
say
that?
does
it,
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
language
that
you...
you
told
the
chief
justice
that
11347
says
that
all
existing
and
collective
bargaining
contracts
have
to
be
preserved,
and
i
just
don't
see
that
in
the
section,
unless
i'm
missing
something.
justice
kennedy
but
do
those
refer
to
the
collective
bargaining
contracts?
justice

these
are
consolidated
cases,
which
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
they
involve
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
authority
to
approve
rail
carrier
consolidations.
the
case
turns
on
one
phrase
in
a
federal
statute.
under
49
u.
s.
c.
11341(a),
a
rail
carrier
in
an
icc
approved
consolidation
is
"exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
from
all
other
law,
including
state
and
municipal
law,
as
necessary
to
let
it
carryout
the
transaction."
and
the
question
here
is
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
term,
"all
other
law".
the
cases
here
today
involve
two
different
railroad
consolidations.
one
involves
the
acquisition
and
consolidation
of
norfolk
&
western
railway,
co.
and
southern
railway
company;
and
the
other,
involves
the
acquisition
and
consolidation
of
chessie
system,
inc.
and
seaboard
coastline
industries,
inc.,
both
of
which
are
parent
corporations
of
railroad
companies.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
icc
approved
the
consolidated
transaction.
the
merge
to
railroads
then
combined
in
coordinated
operations
in
the
manner
that
required
displacement
of
jobs.
the
petitioners
are
unions
of
the
displaced
employees.
they
invoked
arbitration
and
claimed
that
the
job
displacements
violated
certain
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
arbitration
panels
in
both
cases
ruled
for
the
railroad
carriers.
the
icc
affirmed
the
arbitration
decisions
reasoning
that
the
statute
here
in
question
exempted
the
parties
to
the
transaction
from
the
obligations
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
the
icc
and
remanded
holding
that
the
federal
statute
does
not
authorize
the
icc
to
relieve
a
party
of
collective
bargaining
obligations
even
if
the
obligations
impede
implementation
of
an
approved
transaction.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
exemption
in
the
statute
from
all
other
law
extends
to
a
carrier's
legal
obligations
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
exemption
language
in
the
statute
is
clear,
broad,
and
unqualified,
manifesting
an
unambiguous
congressional
intent
to
exempt
any
obligation
by
law
as
necessary
to
carryout
an
icc
approved
transaction.
the
exemption
is
broad
enough
to
override
the
obligations
imposed
by
the
law
which
make
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
binding,
namely
the
railway
labor
act.
our
interpretation
of
the
statute,
we
think,
makes
sense
of
the
interstate
commerce
act's
consolidated
provisions
which
were
designed
to
promote
efficiency
in
interstate
transportation
by
removing
the
burdens
of
excessive
expenditures.
section
11341(a)
guarantees
that
once
employee
interests
are
accounted
for
in
the
icc's
approval
of
the
transaction,
then
the
railway
labor
act
whose
major
dispute
resolution
process
is
often
interminable
will
not
prevent
the
efficiencies
of
the
consolidation
from
being
achieved.
our
reading
at
11341(a)
does
not
exempt
carriers
from
all
law
but
rather,
as
the
statute
requires
from
all
law
necessary
to
carryout
an
approved
transaction.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joins.
