justice
scalia
mr.
sheldon,
let
me
put
this
question
in
terms
of
one
of
the
examples
given
in
one
of
the
briefs
taken
from
a
law
review
article,
as
i
recall.
the
statement
was
made
that
a
tax
upon...
upon
sleeping,
measured
by
the
number
of
shoes
in
your
closet,
is
in
fact
a
tax
upon
shoes.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
suppose
you,
you
could
have...
we
have
approved
gross
receipts
taxes,
right?
justice
scalia
now
why
isn't,
why
aren't
they
just
as
discriminatory
against
out-of-state,
some
out-of-state
companies,
and
just
as
contrary
to
the
other
principles
that
you
are
urging
as
this
tax
is?
justice
scalia
the
measure
is
the
receipts
in
michigan,
right?
i
mean,
that's
the
measure
that
you
complain
about.
justice
scalia
what
you
claim
distorts
this
is
the
fact
that
they
are
using
michigan
sales,
isn't
that
it?
justice
scalia
but
they
could
tax
you
100
percent
on
michigan
sales,
and
we
would
say
it's
okay.
so
if
you
view
this
as
not
really
a
tax
on
value
added
or
on
anything
else,
but
just
as
a
tax
on
gross
receipts
in
michigan,
we
would
say
fine.
so
if
you
believe
it's
a
tax
on
shoes
rather
than
on
sleeping,
this
is
okay.
justice
scalia
well,
this,
this
is
a
tax
on
value
added,
the
same
way
the
first
tax
i
mentioned
to
you
was
a
tax
on
sleeping.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
say
its
a
tax
on
value
added.
if
they
are
measuring
it
by
michigan
sales,
it
is
a
tax
on
michigan
sales.
so
what?
and
we
have
said
that
is
okay.
justice
scalia
you
have
no
complaint
about
that,
that
is
okay.
that
isn't
what
distorts
it
here,
right.
justice
scalia
michigan
sales.
justice
scalia
it's
a
tax
on
sleeping,
you
say,
right?
justice
scalia
but
you
just
acknowledged
that
that
doesn't
matter.
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
call
it.
what
you
measure
it
by
is
what
the
tax
is
imposed
on.
justice
scalia
this
is
a
tax
on
sleeping,
not
on
shoes.
justice
scalia
this
is
a
tax
on
sleeping.
we
keep
coming
back
to
that,
but
you
answered
that
question
the
other
way.
i
thought
you
answered
the
question
that
even
though
you
call
it
a
tax
on
sleeping,
if
you
measure
it
by
the
shoes
it
is
a
tax
on
shoes.
suppose
michigan
had
never
mentioned
value-added
tax.
suppose
it
had
never
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
tax
base
would
be
total
compensation
plus
total
capital
cost
plus...
plus
profit.
suppose
it
had
simply
said
for
every
business,
for
every
company
doing
business
in
michigan
we
are
going
to
impose
a
tax
that
consists,
a
tax
of
2
percent
on
the
three...
the
three-factor
formula,
michigan
compensation
over
total
compensation,
plus
michigan
capital
costs
over
total
costs,
plus
michigan
sales
over
total
sales,
divided
by
3.
suppose
that's
how
the
tax
were
described.
would
that
tax
be
constitutional?
it
never
mentioned
value
added,
it
never
mentioned
what
it
is
taxing,
except
it
recites
the
factor.
and
for
anybody
doing
business
in
michigan
you
pay
that
tax.
justice
scalia
the
total
value
of
the
business
divided
by
those...
those
three
factors.
justice
scalia
mr....
mr.
roesch,
is
it
accurate
to
say
that
this
is
a
tax
upon
business
activity?
it's
a
tax
that
is
said
to
be
measured...
the
tax
base
consists
of,
according
to
the
michigan
law,
total
compensation
plus
total
capital
costs
plus
profit.
i
read
that
as
a
tax
upon
compensation,
capital
costs,
and
profits,
not
a
tax
upon
business
activities.
justice
scalia
it's
the
shoes,
not
the
sleeping.
justice
scalia
that's
fine,
but
does
that
mean
that
simply
because
you
can't
identify
it
precisely
you
don't
even
have
to
try
to
identify
it
approximately?
