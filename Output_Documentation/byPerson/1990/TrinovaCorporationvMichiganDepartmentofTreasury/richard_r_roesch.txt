mr.
richard
r.
roesch
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
michigan
levies
a
single
business
tax,
so-called
because
it
replaced
seven
previous
existing
taxes.
it
is
imposed
upon
business
activities.
these
business
activities
are
measured
by
a
so-called
value
add.
it
is
quantified
by
federal
taxable
income,
plus
several
deductions
from
gross
income
to
arrive
at
federal
taxable
income,
namely
compensation
cost,
depreciation
cost,
net
interest
expense,
and
net
royalty
expense.
now
in
the
case
of
a
unitary
multistate
business,
this--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--yes.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
yes,
that's
very
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
no,
there
is
no
disagreement.
in
fact,
the
gross
national
product
figures
also
say
that
77
percent
is
compensation
payments.
there's
no
disagreement.
to
go
on,
in
the
case
of
unitary
multistate
business,
this
tax
base
which
results
is
apportioned
to
michigan
by
the
standard
three-factor
formula
of
property,
payroll,
and
sales.
now,
the
question
here
is
not
does
michigan
tax
any
discrete
components.
the
question
here
is
very
simply
is
michigan
taxing
a
unitary
multistate
enterprise.
trinova
is--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--justice
stevens,
if
michigan
were
to
impose
a
payroll
tax
similar
to
a
fica
tax
upon
payrolls,
obviously
michigan
wouldn't
have
a
jurisdictional
reach
over
ohio
components.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
wait,
we
are
not...
the
michigan
tax
is
upon
business
activities.
it's
an
entirely
different--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--a
payroll
tax,
if
it
were
simply
upon
payroll
specifically,
could
not
be
justified
under
the
unitary
business--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--that's
not
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
michigan
tax
is
not
upon
compensation.
it
is
not
upon
depreciation.
it
is
not
upon
any
particular
element.
it
is
upon
the
business
activities.
it
is
business
activities
that
are
apportioned.
surely
we
measure
these
business
activities
not
by
net
income;
we
measure
it
differently.
and
we
come
right
back
to
the
unitary
business
principle.
if
a...
if
a
state
seeks
to
tax
the
proportional
activities
within
the
state
of
a
unitary
enterprise,
it
may
certainly
do
so
by
unitary
apportionment.
in
mobil
oil,
for
example,
this
court
said
the
unitary
business
principle
is
the
linchpin
of
apportionability,
and
that
this
allowed
separate
accounting
for
foreign
source
dividends.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
the
factors
can
be
identified,
but
you
cannot
identify
where
the
value
is
added.
for
example,
i
believe
it
was
your
opinion
in
moorman
which
pointed
out
that
for
all
that
appears
the
iowa
sales,
the
large
sales
may
have
produced
much
greater
income,
a
much
greater
margin
of
income
than
the
illinois
property
and
payroll.
and
so
it
is
here
we
cannot...
there
has
been
no
separate
accounting
for
value
added.
there
has
been
only
a
reference
to
separate
accounting
for
so-called
components
for
the
two
costs,
compensation,
which
surely
is
the
biggest
cost,
and
depreciation.
but
this
court
already
has
said
in
container
corporation
and
amerada
hess,
it
said
very
specifically--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--a
value
added
by
labor?
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
i
believe
that
very
well
might
be.
but
i
pose
even
a
better
one.
could
michigan
say
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
major
expense
of
the
business,
namely
compensation,
and
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
and
apply
this
major...
to
this
major
expense,
to
all
of
your
$226
million
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
and
we
are
going
to
say
of
this
expense
there
is
attributable
to
michigan
9
percent,
the
average
of
your
insignificant
property
payroll
and
your
27
percent
sales.
and
i
say
most
certainly
michigan
could
use
that
9
percent
as
a
measure
of
michigan
business
activity.
and
this
is
really
what
we
have
here.
we
have
here--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
yes,
your
honor,
but
for
purposes
of...
for
purposes
of
measuring,
for
purposes
of
measuring
how
much
michigan
may
get
of
these
items,
they
are
not
site
specific.
like
i
tried
to
say
in
amerada
hess,
this
court
specifically
noted
that...
that
the
cost
of
a
unitary
enterprise
cannot
be
deemed
confined
to
the
locality
in
which
they
are
incurred.
and
this
is,
this
court
has
disallowed
specific
accounting
for
items
either
of
income
or
cost.
so
what
i
am
saying
is
none
of
these
items
as
such
is
site
specific
when
i
tax
activity.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
if
michigan
were
to
have
separate
taxes
upon
these
components,
and
this
is
our
major
disagreement
here.
trinova
views
the
tax
as
being
one
tax
upon
compensation,
one
tax
upon
depreciation,
another
tax
upon
interest
and
royalty
expense,
and
they
say
we
can
identify
where
these,
where
all
of
these
site
specific...
or
site-specific
costs
are
incurred,
and
therefore
the
state
of
michigan
must
take
that
into
account.
it
can
only
tax
a
certain
amount
of
compensation;
it
can
only
tax
a
certain
amount
of
depreciation.
if
this
is
what
michigan
did,
rather
than
imposing
a
tax
upon
the
overall
proportional
business
activities
in
michigan,
then
most
certainly
trinova
would
have
an
argument.
then
it
could
separate
out
these
components.
this
court
has
never
allowed
in
a
unitary
business
case,
has
never
allowed
the
sourcing
of
foreign
source
dividends
in
mobil,
or
the
functional
separate
accounting
in
exxon
v.
wisconsin,
or
the
separate
accounting
for
the
stores
in
butler
brothers
v.
mccolgan.
in
each
case
this
court
has
said
that
in
a
unitary
enterprise
we
cannot
identify
where
the
tax
base,
at
what
link
in
the
chain
of
multistate
operations
this
tax
base
is
generated.
and
i
submit
that
there
is
no
way
to
say
that
the
michigan
activities
do
not
contribute
the
amount
of
value
to...
that
is
being
taxed
by
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
it
seemed
to
me
that--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--the
theory
of
the
tax
and
its
apportion
mechanism
completely
really
unrelate.
if
we're
talking
about
value-added
tax,
the
only
theory
is
that
we
tax
the
difference
between
the
amount
of
costs
i
have
for
raw
materials
and
services
throughout
the
business
and
the
amount
of
my
gross
receipts.
the
theory
here
is
very
simply
you
must
pay
for
governmental
services
the
social
costs
you
generate.
and
on
income
tax,
we
are
talking
of
ability
to
pay,
really.
so
these
are
really
when
we
are
talking
about
the
theories.
but
as
i
understood
justice
stevens'
question
it
was
this,
if
the
state
of
michigan
were
to
say
we
are
imposing
a
straightforward
payroll
tax,
then
i
would
believe
that
michigan,
if
on
the
straightforward
payroll
tax
let's
say
of
1
percent
upon,
could
only
tax
the
michigan
payroll.
it
couldn't
reach
outside
and
tax
nebraska
payroll
or
iowa
payroll.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
if...
if
you
have
no
internal
consistency
problem,
and
that
is
what
your
question
really
implies,
if
other
states
enacted
a
similar
tax
and
we
would
have...
and
it
would
be
equitable,
then
i
would
have
no
hesitation
to
say
yes,
a
state
could
enact
that.
i
am
going
now
to
container
corporation.
container
corporation
requires
apportionment
formula
to
be
both
internally
and
externally
consistent.
you
know
what
that
internal
consistency
means?
that
if
all
the
states
enacted
a
similar
apportionment
device
there
would
be
no
great
overlapping
of
tax
base.
there
would
be
no
multiple
taxation.
external
consistency
the
court
has
interpreted
as
being
that
the
factors
used
in
the
apportionment
formula
must
be
related
to
the
ultimate
activities
here.
and
i
believe,
for
the
taxing
subject,
i
believe
that
when
michigan
says
we
are
taxing
you
upon
your
business
activities
which
you
are
conducting
in
michigan,
and
a
certain
proportion
thereof
is
attributable
to
michigan,
that
it
can
use
certainly
the
three-factor
formula
which
this
court,
once
again
in
container
corporation,
called
a
benchmark.
i
believe
that
averaging
the
three
factors
of
property,
payroll,
and
sales
truly
does
reflect
the
activities
which
a
corporation
or
any
business
conducts
within
the
state.
and
i
believe
that
a
state
is
justified
in
asking
a
return
in
such
an
event.
the--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--the
discrimination
argument
can
be
answered
very
simply
once
again
as
it
was
answered
in
moorman.
the
discrimination
argument
hinges
completely
upon
acceptance
of
the
requirement
of
separate
accounting
for
this
type
of
a
tax.
if
no
separate
accounting
is
required,
then
obviously
the
michigan...
there
is
no
discrimination,
because
the
out-of-state
industry
cannot
show
that
the
out-of-state
industry
is
burdened
more
than
in-state.
the
other
coin...
the
other
coin
that
we
have
here
is
the
alternative
argument,
which
presupposes
a
two-factor
formula.
a
two-factor
formula
ends
up,
as
noted
on
page
44
of
our
brief,
with
a
tax
of
$5,199
for
doing
a
business
resulting
in
over
$104
million
of
revenue
to
the
state...
to
trinova.
now,
this
$5,199
on
top
of
it
would
never
change,
because
it
is
only
property
and
payroll,
whether
trinova
sold
$100,
$1
million,
or
$100
million
in
this
year.
now
such
a
two-factor
formula
in
my
estimation
would
really...
it
may
pass
constitutional
muster,
but
would
not
really
reflect
any
kind
of
business
activity,
because
i
believe
that
the
social
costs
generated
by
sales
of
$100
million,
just
the
use
of
the
courts,
the
highways,
the
schools,
are
much
greater
than
the
social
costs
generated
by
a
sale
of
$100.
and
yet
the
two-factor
formula
would
lead
to
that
particular
result.
now,
i
think
that
moorman
very
clearly
answers
the
discrimination
argument
by
noting
that
the
only
way
you
can
show
discrimination
is
if
you
say
that
the
michigan
formula,
that
the
michigan
formula...
that
you
must
look
to
other
formulas
to
see
that
the
michigan
formula
is
discriminatory.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
no.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
your
honor,
your
honor,
you
are
correct.
moorman
had
not
included
the
tax
base.
but
let's
talk
about
tax
base
for
a
minute.
tax
base
in
michigan
obviously
could
be
apportioned
gross
receipts,
and
indeed
apportioned
gross
receipts,
[inaudible]
tax
as
so,
apportioned
gross
receipts
were
the
measure
of
the
tax
upon
the
doing
of
business
in
the
1959
second
railway
express
case
v.
virginia.
in
that
case
this
court
upheld
the
virginia
tax
which
was
measured
by
apportioned
gross
receipts,
namely
total
gross
receipts
of
railway
express
apportioned
to
virginia
by
a
mileage
ratio.
so
obviously,
if...
if
gross
receipts
may
be
apportioned,
and
obviously
if
net
income
may
be
apportioned,
then
something
in
between--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
we
are
not
taxing,
once
again,
the
depreciation.
we
are
not
taxing...
we
are
only
looking--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
not
taxing
the
total
gross
receipts,
but
we
are
taxing
a
goodly
portion
of
gross
receipts.
indeed,
the
michigan
sbt
has
a
nice
distinguishing
feature.
it
says
at
the
option
of
the
taxpayer
he
may
pay
upon
50
percent
of
his
gross
receipts.
now
this
option
really
is
only
taken
by
a
taxpayer
whose
so-called
value
added
would
exceed
50
percent.
so
really
what
we
have
is
in
effect
a
gross
receipts
tax
limited
to
50
percent
of
gross
receipts.
now,
in
this
connection
i
cannot
see
very
much
difference
here
between
the
new
jersey
case,
amerada
hess,
and
between
the...
the
michigan
tax
which
is
involved
here
with
the
sbt.
in
new
jersey
what
we
had,
we
had
a
so-called
new
jersey
net-income
measure.
but
in
new
jersey
net
income
was
augmented
by
the
special
deductions
for
net
operating
loss
and
other
special
deductions,
plus
the
federal
income
tax
and
the
federal
windfall
profits
tax.
now,
in
that
case
what
you
really
had,
you
had
an
income
tax
which
was
augmented
by
costs
of
the
business.
and
this
court...
what
was
stressed
in
this
court
was
that
windfall
profits
tax
was
site
specific,
it
should
be
excluded
from
the
preapportionment
tax
base.
this
court
disagreed.
it
said
in
a
unitary
enterprise
the
costs
are
no
more
site
specific
than
the
income
elements
may
be
deemed
site
specific.
and
it
upheld
the
new
jersey
tax.
now
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
we
also
start
with
federal
taxable
income.
it
is
only
that
we
have
different
additions
to
federal
taxable
income.
what
we
have
is
a
compensation
addition
and
a
depreciation
addition.
and
these
expense
additions,
they
form
the
tax
base.
and
these,
obviously,
if
the
windfall
profits
tax
could
not
be...
a
cost
could
not
be
deemed
site
specific,
it
is
hard
to
see
why
depreciation
and
compensation,
which
are
also
costs,
should
be
deemed
site
specific.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
yes,
but
it
has
never
been
the
rule
that
your
apportionment,
that
the
factors
in
your
apportionment
factor
be
reflected
in
the
tax
subject,
in
the
tax
base.
that
has
never
been
the
rule.
it
would
never
even
be
with
the
special
industries,
because
mileage
formulas
really
do
not
reflect,
for
example,
any
particular
property
or
payroll.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
the
hope
was--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--that
is
very
hard
to
say.
it
may
have
attracted
some
business
to
the
state,
but--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--it
was
hoped
that
it
would.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
that
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
why
do
you
think
for
a
minute--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--thank
you,
justice
white.
no,
i
was
just
going
to
mention
that
the
large
plants
with
the
small
compact
cars
of
general
motors
were
not
built
in
michigan,
they
were
built
in
tennessee.
so
obviously
all
this
attraction
didn't
really
work
out.
it
was
not
meant
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
michigan.
if
michigan
wanted
to
discriminate
it
would
have--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--yes.
our
income
tax
in
michigan
was...
was
unpredictably
cyclical.
there
were
years
in
which
michigan
got
practically
no
income
from
its
corporate
income
tax,
and
then
boom
years
it
got
a
lot.
it
also
replaced
the
net
worth
tax
in
michigan.
that
was
the
only
stable
tax
that
we
had
in
michigan.
it
replaced
a
tax...
but
that
tax
was
disliked
by
the,
by
all
the
business
community,
in
state
and
out
state.
it
also
displaced
a
tax
upon
intangibles,
mainly
accounts
receivable
for
the
business.
and
finally
a
tax
upon
their
business
inventories,
which
was
a
property
tax,
which
is
really
an
anachronism
because
most
states
have
repealed
their
personal
property
taxes,
particularly
upon
inventories.
now
this
was
also
a
tax
simplification.
instead
of
having
to
deal
with
all
of
these
taxes,
the
taxpayer
now
had
to
deal
only
with
one
tax.
this
tax
would
be
more...
much
more
stable,
because...
like
a
gross
receipts
tax
would
be
extremely
stable.
and
so
anything
that
is
a
modified
gross
receipts
tax,
which
you
can
view
this
sbt
as
a
modified
gross
receipts
tax,
also
is
much
more
stable.
it
is
not
subject
to
fluctuations
that
base,
like
income,
is
subject
to
fluctuations.
it
was
hoped
that
because
of
simpler
tax
simplification,
also
because
the
businessman
could
more
closely
forecast
his
tax
liability,
that
this
would
in
itself
be
greatly
attractive
to
industry.
but
there
was
no
design
to
try...
in
the
single
business
tax,
to
bring
business
into
the
state,
to,
in
the
words
of
westinghouse
v.
tully,
to
exert
an
inexorable
hydraulic
pressure
to
have
business
performed
in
the
state
rather
than
out
of
state.
quite
to
the
contrary,
if
michigan
had
done
that
it
probably
would
have
adopted
a
flat
sales
factor
the
way
iowa
has,
for
example.
that
would
really
have...
that
really
would
have
been
an
encouragement
to
perform
in
the
state
and
sell
out
of
state.
and
yet
this
court
upheld
in
moorman
the
single
factor
sales
formula.
now,
ultimately
what
this
case
boils
down
to
is
that
while
trinova
admits
that
separate
geographic
accounting
is
not
permissible
for
an
income
tax,
that
it
should
be
constitutionally
required
when
we
have
other
than
an
income
tax,
that
if
we
have
a
tax
like
michigan
which
can
be
viewed
as
either
an
income
augmented
by
cost
tax,
modified
gross
receipts
tax,
or,
as
the
michigan
court
puts
it,
a
tax
upon
the
value
added
to
products
and
services.
now,
trinova's
separate
accounting
argument
really
results
in
converting
an
admitted
value
added,
an
admitted
tax
base
of
$221
million,
into
a
michigan
loss
of
$2
million.
trinova
pays
no
michigan
tax
for
the
privilege
of
doing
$104
million
worth
of
business
in
the
state
of
michigan.
that
is
the
consequence
of
the
separate
accounting
argument.
in
butler
brothers
v.
mccolgan
the
court
was
faced
with
the
same
idea.
it
was
faced
also
once
again
with
that
idea
in
exxon
v.
wisconsin.
and
in
each
one
of
these
cases
the
court
flatly
disallowed
converting
a
preapportionment
tax
base
positive
into
a
negative
loss
within
the
state.
realizing
that
the
separate
accounting
theory
might
not
be
accepted,
trinova
evolved
a
secondary
argument
which
is
inconsistent
with
its
separate
accounting
theories.
it
evolved
the
argument
yes,
maybe
apportionment
is
proper
for
our
value
added.
but
they
say
it
should
only
be
apportioned
by
a
two-factor
formula.
but
as
i
noted
before,
and
as
explained
on
page
44
of
the
state's
brief,
such
a
two-factor
formula
would
produce
exactly
the
same
amount
of
tax
whether
or
not
there
was
any
substantial
sales
activity
in
michigan
by
trinova,
whether
they
sold
$1,000,
$1
million,
or
$100
million
worth
of
sales
in
michigan.
in
complete
auto
transit,
in
complete
auto
transit
this
court
tried
to
get
away
from
looking
to
the
labels
of
a
tax
and
said
we
are
going
to
look
at
a
practical
effect
of
this
tax.
and
yet
the
whole
argument
here
is
on
labels.
it
is
admitted
that
if
michigan
imposed
a
straightforward
income
tax
it
could
use
the
three-factor
formula.
if
it
imposed
a
gross
receipts
tax,
sure
it
could
use
a
three-factor
formula.
a
net
worth
tax,
as
it
did
impose
previously,
a
three-factor
formula
may
be
applied.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
your
honor--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--no.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
your
honor,
you
are
correct.
the
three-factor
formula
has
only
been
applied
in
income
tax
cases.
on
gross
receipts
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
and
i
mentioned
was
railway
express
v.
virginia,
which
did
use
a
mileage
apportionment--
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
--against
total
gross
receipts,
meaning
gross
receipts
may
be
apportionable
as
a
measure
of
business
activity.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
well,
the
state
was
taxing
business
activity,
and
it
said
we
are
going
to
tax
this
business
activity
not
by
taxing
a
portion
of
your
income,
but
a
portion
of
your
gross
receipts.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
and
michigan
here
says
the
same
thing.
we
are
going
to
tax
that
portion
of
your
business
activity
attributable
to
michigan
not
by
measuring
it
by
income
or
even
gross
receipts,
but
by
something
in
between.
now
the
practical
operation
of
the
tax,
trinova
pays
28.5
cents
per
$100
of
sales,
less
than
3/10
of
1
percent.
and
i
could
tell
you
by
statistics...
well,
it
is
said
and
it
is
admitted
that
the
michigan
business
on
the
average
will
pay
over
4/10
of
1
percent
in
terms
of
gross
receipts.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
that
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
no,
that
is
not
the
whole
answer.
let
us
take
in-state
michigan
business,
completely
intrastate
business.
it
also
pays
over
4/10
of
1
percent.
now,
i
can
contemplate,
i
am
talking
about
the
practical
operation
of
the
tax.
i
can
contemplate
a
practical
operation
of
this
tax
whenever
i
wash
the
windshield
of
my
1980
oldsmobile.
i
knew
that
trinova
sold
this
window
glass,
this
windshield,
to
the
general
motors
plant,
the
oldsmobile
plant
in
lansing,
michigan,
for
about
$100.
and
i
know
that
the
value
it
has
added
to
this
windshield
is
about
$56.
now
michigan,
instead
of
using
the
$100,
uses
the
$56
to
apportion
to
itself
a
certain
amount.
when
i
look
at
this
$100
windshield,
i
say
for
this
business
in
michigan,
the
state
of
michigan
is
extracting
from
you
$28.5
cents.
i
think
that
is
a
modest
recompense
for
the
privileges
and
protections
afforded
by
the
state.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
i
will
end
my
argument.
mr.
richard
r.
roesch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
