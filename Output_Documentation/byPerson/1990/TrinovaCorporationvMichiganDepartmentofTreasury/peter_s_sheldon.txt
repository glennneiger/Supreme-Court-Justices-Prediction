mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
a
value-added
tax,
specifically
the
michigan
single
business
tax,
which
is
known
more
commonly
as
the
sbt.
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
stipulated
facts
from
a
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
that
upheld
the
tax
against
petitioner's
constitutional
challenge.
there
are
two
questions
presented.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
three-factor
property
payroll
and
sale
apportionment
formula
that
is
contained
in
the
sbt
taxes
value
added
outside
of
michigan
and
produces
a
grossly
distorted
result
in
violation
of
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses.
the
second
question
is
whether
that
same
three-factor
apportionment
formula
discriminates
in
favor
of
in-state
businesses
and
against
petitioner
and
other
similarly
situated
out-of-state
businesses
by
systematically
and
irrationally
reducing
the
tax
bases
of
the
former,
while
systematically
and
irrationally
increasing
the
tax
bases
of
the
latter.
the
primary
points
we
make
are
these.
first,
the
tax
base
of
the
sbt,
like
the
tax
base
of
all
value-added
taxes,
consists
primarily
of
site-specific
components,
and
those
site-specific
components,
principally
compensation
and
depreciation,
are
readily
susceptible
to
precise
identification
and
allocation
on
a
state-by-state
basis.
they
are
site
specific
because
you
know
where
the
labor
is
performed,
and
therefore
where
value
added
by
the
labor
takes
place.
you
know
where
the
depreciable
plant
is
located,
and
therefore
where
value
added
by
depreciable
plant
takes
place.
for
the
average
sbt
taxpayer
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
its
tax
base
consists
of
compensation
to
the
extent
of
77
percent,
capital
to
the
extent
of
another
17
percent,
and
profit
to
a
much
lesser
extent,
only
about
6
percent.
so
you
can
see
the
site-specific
components
dominate.
and
for
trinova,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
those
site-specific
components
are
even
more
dominant,
because
here
also
the
record
clearly
shows
by
stipulation
that
trinova's
tax
base
consisted
of
compensation
to
the
extent
of
102
percent,
depreciation
to
the
extent
of
another
11
percent,
and
profit,
profit
added
not
1
cent
of
positive
contribution
to
the
value-added
tax
base.
and
that
is
because
trinova,
during
the
1980
tax
year
that
is
at
issue
here,
incurred
a
significant
loss
from
its
operations.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
perhaps
not,
your
honor,
if...
if
trinova
had
had
a
tax
base
that
was
comprised
of
the
profit
component
to
a
significant
extent.
but
in
this
case
the
contribution
of
profit
to
the
value-added
tax
base
component
was
zero.
in
fact
it
was
a
negative
contribution.
now
because
these
site-specific
components
are
susceptible
to
allocation,
there
is
no
need
to
apportion
that.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
it's
not
a
matter
of
stipulation,
justice
stevens,
but
in
the
merits
brief,
appendix
la
contains
a
publication
from
the
department
of
treasury
that
clearly
sets
forth
for
the
average
taxpayer
what
their
components
of
tax
base
are.
and
there,
very
clearly,
the
compensation
component
is
dominant
and
constitutes
approximately
77
percent
of
the
average
taxpayer's
tax
base.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
the
point,
justice
scalia,
is
that
a
tax
has
to
be
analyzed,
in
testing
its
constitutionality
under
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses,
in
terms
of
its
practical
effect,
in
terms
of
its
economic
reality.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
and
here,
this
tax,
by
whatever
label
it
may
be
called,
is
in
practical
effect
and
more
than
anything
else
a
tax
on
compensation.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
well,
a
gross
receipts
tax
is
generally
aimed
at
determining
a
tax
base
that
relates
to
the
gross
receipts,
the
actual
gross
receipts
that
is
derived
from
activity
within
the
taxing
state.
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
gross
receipts
tax.
we
have
a
value-added
tax,
and
the
measure
of
the
tax
base
is
something
different
from
a
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
the
tax
base
of
a
value-added
tax
base
that
uses
the
additive
method
of
calculation,
such
as
the
michigan
sbt,
is
comprised
of--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
but
it's
not
a
tax
on
gross
receipts,
your
honor,
it's
a
tax
on
value
added.
and
when
you
look
at
the
value
added
components
of
tax
base,
the
principal
component
is
compensation.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
but
the
measure
of
the
tax,
your
honor,
is
not
michigan
sales.
the
measure
of
the
tax,
the
tax
base
is
the
compensation
payments
that
the
taxpayer
makes--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--what
distorts
it,
your
honor,
is
the
inclusion
of
an
equally
weighted
sales
factor--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--in
the
three-factor
apportionment
formula.
and
what
that
equally-weighted
sales
factor
does
is
that
it
skews
the
attribution
of
the
major
site-specific
component
of
a
value-added
tax
base,
which
is
compensation.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
but...
that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
but
the
state
of
michigan
has
not
elected
to
tax
gross
receipts.
it
has
elected
to
tax
value
added,
and--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--i
am
saying
that--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--your...
your
honor,
and
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
value
added.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
the
practical
effect
of
the
tax,
we
submit,
your
honor,
is
a
tax
on
value
added,
and
the
only
way
that
michigan
could
exact
a
positive
contribution
of
tax
from
trinova
in
this
case
is
by
taxing
extra-territorial
value,
which
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
that
is
my
point.
if
this
tax,
as
we
contend,
is
unconstitutional
because
it
taxes
extra-territorial
value
and
produces
a
grossly
distorted
result,
or
because
it
is
discriminatory,
the
fact
that
michigan
could
have
imposed
a
plainly
valid
gross
receipts
tax
and
generated
as
much
revenue
as
a
result
of
that
can't
be
used
as
a
legal
justification
for
excusing
or
saving
the
unconstitutional
infirmities
of
this
tax.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
your
honor,
we
acknowledge
that
sales
activity,
including,
for
instance,
the
intangible
contributions
of
centralized
management,
functional
integration,
and
economies
of
scale
may
indeed
impact
and
influence
taxpayer
decisions
that
relate
to
the
employment
and
deployment
of
labor,
and
to
the
acquisition
and
location
of
depreciable
plant.
and
we
acknowledge
also
that
sales
activity
and
these
other
intangible
factors
may
also
influence
taxpayer
decisions
as
to
the
amount
that
may
be
paid
for
those
value-adding
activities.
but
the
fact
nevertheless
remains
that
when
those
taxpayer
decisions
are
implemented,
you
will
still
know
precisely
where
that
value-adding
activity
takes
place,
and
you
will
know
precisely
the
amount
of
value
added
by
that
activity.
the
influence
or
the
efficiencies
that
may
be
generated
by
sales
activity
or
by
these
intangible
contributions
of
centralized
management
and
the
like
will
be
reflected
only
in
the
measure
of
the
profit
component
of
a
value-added
tax
base.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
the
intangible
factors
only
impact
on
the
measure
of
the
profit
component
of
a
value-added
tax
base,
which
we
acknowledge
may
be
properly
subjected
to
three-factor
formulary
apportionment.
but
under
value-added
taxing
principles,
and
indeed
as
confirmed
by
language
that
is
contained
in
the
single
business
tax
act
itself,
and
indeed
even
as
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
noted,
the
measure
of
value
added
by
labor
and
capital,
specifically
the
compensation
and
depreciation
contributions
to
those
components,
is
the
taxpayer's
cost.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
well,
translated,
the
cost
with
respect
to
the
labor
component
is
what
the
taxpayer
pays
its
employees
for
the
services
they
have
performed.
and
with
respect
to
depreciation,
translated,
the
cost
is
the
amount
of
capital
consumed
during
the
accounting
period
that
is
measured
by
tax
depreciation.
the
single
business
tax
act
itself,
your
honor,
in
section
9
specifically
defines
the
contribution
of
labor
to
a
value-added
tax
base
in
terms
of
what
the
employer
pays
its
employees.
there
is
no
transferred
value
concept
that
applies
here.
there
is
no
enhanced
value
concept
that
applies
here.
the
measure
of
value
added
with
respect
to
the
labor
contribution
is
what
the
employer
pays
for.
and
the
same
is
true,
and
section
9
of
the
sbt
confirms
this,
with
respect
to
the
depreciation
component
of
the
sbt.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
we
say,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to
the
site-specific
components
of
a
value-added
tax
base,
there
is
no
need
to
apportion
them.
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
state
could
not
come
up
with
an
apportionment
formula
that
might
fairly
reflect
the
contributions
of
labor
and
depreciation
to
michigan,
even
though
that
formula
might
not
derive
an
absolutely
precise
result.
if
it
didn't
result
in
gross
distortion,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
a
constitutional
problem
here.
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case
application
of
the
three-factor
formula
against
petitioner's
tax
base
for
the
1980
year
has
attributed
to
michigan
compensation
that
is
39
times
more
than
value
added
by
petitioner's
michigan-based
employees,
and
then
it
has
attributed
to
michigan
depreciation
expense
that
is
970
times
more
than
the
value
added
by
the
capital
consumption
that
is
association
with
petitioner's
michigan-based
plant.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
well,
justice
o'connor,
in
the
hans
rees
case,
of
course,
a
distortion
of
250
percent,
or
about
2.5
times,
was
found
to
be
significant,
enough
to
justify
a
holding
in
the
taxpayer's
favor.
here
we
have
distortion
that
is
many
multiples
of
that.
it
is
between
39
and
970
times,
depending
upon
which
of
these
more--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
application
of
the
three-factor
apportionment
formula
against
the
profit
component
of
the
value-added
tax
base,
because,
as
this
court
has
observed
on
many
prior
occasions,
and
which
we
do
not
contest,
income
is
difficult
to
source
on
a
state-by-state
basis.
and
that
again
is
because
net
income
results
from
the
coalescence
of
a
number
of
different
factors,
some
of
which
are
site
specific,
but
some
of
which,
like
centralized
management,
economies
of
scale,
and
the
like,
are
not.
but
as
to
the
compensation
and
depreciation
contributions
to
the
labor
and
capital
components
of
a
value-added
tax
base,
those
items,
unlike
net
income,
are
site
specific.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
sales
activity
will
derive
revenue,
that's
right,
your
honor.
whether
it
derives
income
is
another
point.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
well,
it
has
not
talked
about
revenue
here.
it
could
have
if
it
wanted
to.
it
could
have
established
as
its
primary
business
tax
a
tax
on
gross
receipts,
but
it
has
not
elected
to
do
here.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
full
hypothetical.
you
described
for
me
the
factors,
what
i
understood
to
be
a
property
payroll
and
sales
factor,
and
then
said
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
2
percent
tax.
but
what
is
the
tax
base
in
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
well,
if
you
define
the
total
value
of
the
business
in
terms
of
value
added
principles,
like
michigan
has
done
here,
most
of
the
tax
base
is
going
to
be
compensation,
and
that
three-factor
formula
will
inevitably
cause
gross
distortion,
because
the
sales
factor...
the
reason
that
is
so
is
because
the
sales
factor
provides
absolutely
no
clue
whatsoever
as
to
where
the
dominant
site-specific
productive
activity
that
underlies
payments
of
compensation
and
depreciation,
which
are
the
lion's
share
of
the
tax
base,
take
place.
there
is
no
rational
relationship.
and
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
that
an
apportionment
formula
in
order
to
be
fair
has
to
reflect
a
reasonable
sense
of
how
income
or
value
is
generated.
here
we
don't
have--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--no,
the
distortion
is
measured--
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
--the
components
of
tax
base...
what
we
are
taxing
here
is
we
are
taxing
productive
activity
that
is
undertaken
by
the
taxpayer,
and
the
tax
itself
defines
productive
activity
in
terms
of
labor
costs,
in
terms
of
capital
costs,
and
to
a
very
much
lesser
extent
in
terms
of
profit.
that
is
what
is
being
taxed.
and
then
it
is
saying
now,
what
is
michigan's
fair
share
of
this
total
value-adding
productive
activity
that
the
taxpayer
is
undertaking?
and
it
has
said
we
are
going
to
measure
that
by
using
an
apportionment
formula
that
is
widely
used
to
apportion
income
under
an
income
tax
act.
and
the
problem
there
is
again
the
use
of
an
equally
weighted
sales
factor,
because
the
value
added
by
the
labor
contribution
to
a
value-added
tax
base
is
sufficiently
measured
by
the
payroll
factor
alone.
and
the
value
added
by
the
depreciation
contribution
to
the
capital
component
is
fairly
reflected
in
the
property
factor
alone.
those
are
the
dominant
parts
of
the
sbt
tax
base.
statistics
tell
us
so.
77
percent
of
the
average
sbt
taxpayer's
tax
base
is
not
income,
it
is
compensation.
because
of
that,
when
you
throw
into
the
mix
an
equally-weighted
sales
factor,
you
are
adding
to
the
mix
in
terms
of
assigning
those
values
to
michigan
something
that
is
irrelevant
and
something
that
is
going
to
cause
distortion.
because
again,
sales
activity
provides
no
rational
clue
whatsoever
as
to
where
the
value-adding
activity
that
underlies
the
payments
of
compensation
and
depreciation
take
place.
in
addition
and
independent
of
the
gross
distortion
that
this
tax
generates,
it
also
produces
a
discriminatory
effect.
and
here
again
the
culprit
is
the
sales
factor.
for
those
labor-intensive
businesses
that
have
property
and
payroll
factors
which
when
averaged
are
greater
than
their
sales
factor,
this
formula
will
enable
them
to
export
out
of
michigan
some
of
their
site-specific,
value-adding
activity,
while
for
the
labor
intensive
business
that
has
property
and
payroll
factors
which
when
averaged
are
less
than
their
sales
factor,
they
will
be
forced
to
import
into
michigan
some
part
of
their
site-specific
value-adding
activity.
and
what
this
means,
what
this
means
is
that
the
out-of-state
taxpayer
that
has
the
characteristics
i
have
just
described
will
pay
more
tax
on
its
michigan
value-adding
activity
than
will
the
in-state
taxpayer
that
has
the
characteristics
that
i
have
just
described.
and
while
that
difference
in
tax
responsibility
is
admittedly
not
the
result
of
the
application
of
different
tax
rates
or
varying
exemptions
or
varying
credits,
nonetheless,
the
practical
effect
of
the
tax
is
the
same.
and
it
serves
to
provide
a
direct
commercial
advantage,
and
an
unfair
one,
to
the
in-staters,
and
it
serves
as
well
to
exert
impermissibly
on
out-of-state
taxpayers
the
possibility
and
the
inducement
to
make
non
tax-neutral
decisions
to
locate
their
property
and
their
work
force
in
michigan.
if
i...
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
additional
questions
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
s.
sheldon
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
do.
just
because
a
business
is
a
unitary
business
does
not
mean
that
the
tax
bases
of
every
tax
to
which
it
may
be
subject
must
be
apportioned.
i
don't
think
anyone
will
argue
that
a
real
property
tax,
or
a
tax
on
immobile
tangible
personal
property,
or
a
severance
tax
that
is
imposed
against
a
business
has
to
be
apportioned
just
because
the
business
is
a
unitary
business.
here
the
practical
effect
of
this
tax
is
not
a
tax
on
business
activity.
that
is
merely
the
legal
justification,
the
legal
excuse,
if
you
will,
for
michigan
to
be
able
to
impose
a
tax
against
those
businesses
that
are
conducting
business
in
the
state.
the
practical
effect
of
the
tax
is
that
for
most
taxpayers
it
is
a
tax
on
compensation,
and
a
tax
on
compensation
is
like
a
tax
on
payroll.
and
a
tax
on
payroll
is,
in
practical
effect,
no
different
than
a
tax
on
real
property,
or
on
immobile
tangible
personal
property,
or
a
severance
tax.
and
like
those
taxes,
it
too
should
not
be
subjected
to
apportionment.
you
need
not
apportion
it.
amerada
hess,
the
point
is
made
that
this
court
said
in
amerada
hess
that
the
cost
of
unitary
business
and
whether
those
costs
are
or
are
not
site
specific
is
irrelevant
in
determining
their
contribution
to
an
income
tax
base.
but
amerada
hess
involved
a
new
jersey
statute,
a
taxing
statute
that
was
clearly
an
income
tax.
it
wasn't
even
close
to
what
the
michigan
sbt
is.
even
after
you
denied
the
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax
deduction,
what
was
left
of
the
new
jersey
tax
was
plainly
an
income
tax
measured
by
federal
taxable
income
with
just
the
one
deduct
taken
away
for
windfall
profit
tax.
here
we
have
a
value-added
tax
where
90
percent
of
the
tax
base,
over
90
percent
consists
of
site-specific
components,
principally
compensation.
the
point
is
amerada
hess
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
site-specific
components
of
a
value-added
tax
base
have
to
be
apportioned,
or
that
their
site
specificity
is
irrelevant.
counsel
claims
that,
look,
trinova
had
$104
million
of
sales
in
michigan
this
year,
during
the
1980
year,
and
the
sbt
as
applied
to
it
exacted
a
tax
that
amounted
to
3/10
of
1
percent
of
its
sales.
so
what
has
trinova
to
argue
about?
well,
what
trinova
has
to
argue
about
is
that
this
tax
is
not
a
gross
receipts
tax.
it's
a
tax
on
value
added.
appendix
3a
of
our
merits
brief
clearly
discloses
that
the
gross
receipts
alternative
is
only
available
to
a
small
fraction
of
michigan
taxpayers,
less
than
10
percent
use
this
gross
receipts
alternative.
so
in
practical
effect
we're
not
talking
about
a
gross
receipts
tax.
we're
talking
about
a
value-added
tax.
and
the
only
way,
the
only
way
michigan
can
exact
1
cent
of
tax
from
trinova
is
to
tax
its
extraterritorial
value,
the
value
that
it
has
added
to
the
contributions
of
its
labor
and
its
capital
outside
of
michigan.
thank
you.
