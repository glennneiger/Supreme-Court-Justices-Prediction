justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
to...
to
follow
up
on
justice
blackmun's
question?
is
there
an
agreement
between
the
adversaries
in
this
case
that
in
the
general...
throughout
the
general
run
of
taxpayers
that
the
site-specific
components
is
around
90
percent?
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
there
another
answer
to
justice
scalia?
two
different
taxpayers,
one
situated
as
you
are
and
another
one
with
precisely
the
same
gross
receipts
in
michigan,
pay
vastly
different
taxes.
justice
stevens
so
it's
not
a
tax
on
gross
receipts.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there?
justice
stevens
you
start
by
talking
about
the
federal
income
tax.
that
is...
is
it
not
correct
that
for
most
businesses
that
is
a
small
portion
of
the
tax
base?
justice
stevens
so
there
isn't
really
a
big
disagreement
about
whether
90
percent
of
the
items
that
are
taxed
are
site
specific.
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
assume
we
have
a
unitary
multistate
enterprise
subject
to
the
tax,
and
assume
michigan
wants
to
impose
a
payroll
tax
on
unitary
businesses,
nothing
but
a
payroll
tax,
and
90
percent
of
the
payroll
is
in
ohio
and
10
percent
is
in
michigan.
could
they
use
the
unitary
formula
to
allocate
such
a
tax,
in
your
judgment?
justice
stevens
why
not?
it's
a
unitary
business.
you
are
just
using
the
formula
to
allocate,
and
a
salesman
in
michigan
probably
bringing
in
all
these
sales.
what
would
be
wrong
with
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
hypothesizing
a
payroll
tax
on
a
unitary
business
apportioned
by
the
formula.
justice
stevens
but
if
it's
payroll
which
is
90
percent
and
you
add
10
percent
more
for
profit,
then
it's
all
right
to
apportion
it?
justice
stevens
you're
not.
justice
stevens
but
the
reason
behind
that
was
that
it
is
impossible
otherwise
to
find
a
fair
way
to
apportion...
to
identify
the
site-specific
nature
of
the
profit,
where
the
profit
comes
from,
except
by
a
formula.
but
here
you
base
this
entirely
on,
90
percent
on
factors
that
can
be
identified.
justice
stevens
what
if
the
tax,
instead
of
just
value
added,
was
a
value
added
by
labor
tax,
and
then
you
apportion
it.
you
figure
your
salesmen
produce
much
more
of...
then
it
would
be
all
right,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
a
value
added
by
labor,
and
you
use...
your
component
is
payroll.
and
then
you
go
ahead
and
apportion
it
by
the
formula.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
stevens
--of
course,
moorman
was
an
attack
on
the
apportionment
formula.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
tax
base,
did
it?
justice
stevens
and
here
the
basic
attack
is
on
the
way
that
the
tax
base
distorts
the
whole
thing.
justice
stevens
but
of
course
the
purpose
of
the
apportionment
of
the
gross
receipts
there
was
to
find
out
how
many
of
those
receipts
took
place
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
here
we
know
how
many
of
the...
how
much
of
the
compensation
and
how
much
of
the
depreciation
took
place
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction...
virtually
none.
justice
stevens
and
here
we
are
not
taxing
gross
receipts.
we
are
just
using
sales
as
one
of
the
factors
for
apportioning
that
which
we
assume
otherwise
could
not
be
apportioned.
justice
stevens
except
the
additions
here
are
90
percent
of
the
total,
and
in
the
typical
income
case
your
addition
is
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
you
say
a
three-factor
formula
for
gross
receipts
tax?
why
would
you
need
a
three-factor
formula?
justice
stevens
there
isn't
a
precedent
for
that,
is
there?
justice
stevens
i
thought
all
the
formula
unitary
business
cases
were
all
income
tax
cases,
because
you
need
some
formula
to
allocate
the
income.
you
don't
need
a
formula
to
allocate
gross
receipts.
justice
stevens
it
was
mileage,
which--
justice
stevens
--right,
if
you
have
some
reasonable
method
of
apportioning
it.
justice
stevens
and
there
is
some
relationship
to
predicting
how
many
of
the
gross
receipts
were
from
that
particular
state.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
because
they'll
have
a
bigger
proportion
of
their
other
two
factors
in
michigan.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
the
whole
answer,
isn't
it?
