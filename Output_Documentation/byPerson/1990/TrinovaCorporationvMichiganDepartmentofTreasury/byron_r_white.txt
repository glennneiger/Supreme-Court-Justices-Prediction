you
may
successfully
argue
that
michigan
isn't
reaching
beyond
its
borders
to
tax,
but
you
still
have
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
it
discriminates
against...
against--
justice
white
well,
wasn't
it
hoped
in
michigan
that
adopting
this
particular
tax
might...
might
attract
some
business
to
the
state?
justice
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
hasn't
it?
justice
white
wasn't
it
hoped
that
it
would?
justice
white
and
the
reason
was
because
it
would
be
more
favorable
to
be
located
in
the
state
than
to
be
located
outside
the
state.
justice
white
you
don't
need
to
ask
me
a
question.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
why
did
you
adopt
this
new...
this
scheme
replaced
something
else,
like
an
income
tax.
