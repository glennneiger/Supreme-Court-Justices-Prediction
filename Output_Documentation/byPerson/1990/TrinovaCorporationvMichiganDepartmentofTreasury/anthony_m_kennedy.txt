justice
kennedy
is
it
all
that
clear?
you
keep
calling
this
a
site-specific
tax.
is
it
going
to
be
conceded
by
the
state
that
this
allocation
is
so
precise?
suppose...
these
were
sales
people
mostly
in
michigan?
justice
kennedy
suppose
that
the
sales
people
were
very,
very
important
in
giving
information
to
the
manufacturing
component
in
the
other
state
about
the
design
requirements
for
this
glass.
and
suppose
that
they
contributed
a
very,
very
significant
amount
to
sales
and
to
the
overall
success
of
the
company
just
by
their
contribution
to
what
was
happening
back
in
iowa.
it's
not
all
that
clear
to
me
that
this
is
site
specific.
justice
kennedy
well,
why
is
that
necessarily
so?
i
mean
it
might
be
or
it
might
not
be.
you
are
saying
that
labor
is
so
site
specific
that
it
must
be,
without
variation,
apportioned
precisely
to
the
amount
of
activity
that
is
economically
measurable
by
a
payroll.
but
that's
just
contrary
to
economic
theory,
isn't
it,
and
to
the
concession
that
you
just
made
that
there
are
a
lot
of
intangible
factors
that
go
to
make
up
the
success
of
a
unitary
business?
justice
kennedy
i
don't
understand
why
that
is.
justice
kennedy
is
it
your
theory
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
state
adopt
the
most
precise
mechanism
available
for
apportionment,
given
the
theory
of
the
tax?
justice
kennedy
does
that
translate
to
the
theory
that
a
distortion
is
measured
against
the
theory
of
the
tax?
justice
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
has
to
be
your
argument.
justice
kennedy
but
why
wouldn't
the
same
result
follow
from
justice
stevens'
first
hypothetical
that
he
gave
you
where
there
was
a
tax
just
on
compensation,
but
that
there
was
an
apportionment
measure
used
based
on
income?
i
don't
know
why
you
conceded
at
the
outset
that
the
state
couldn't
do
that.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
any
fair
measure--
justice
kennedy
--unless
you
are
saying,
unless
you
are
conceding,
which
is
what
i
thought
trinova
should
be
arguing,
which
is
that
the
theory
of
the
tax
and
the
measure
of
the
tax
must
be
in
correlation.
if
they
had
conceded
that
i
would
have
asked
them
what
authority
there
is
for
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
was
done
on
a
formula
that
would,
when
applied
by
other
states
if
they
enacted
a
similar
tax,
was
equitable
to
all.
what
would
be
wrong
with
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
is
no.
89-1106
trinova
corporation
versus
michigan
department
of
the
treasury.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
michigan
levies
its
single
business
tax
upon
entities
which
have
business
activity
within
that
state.
the
single
business
tax
is
known
as
a
value-added
tax.
tax
payers
such
as
petitioner,
trinova
a
major
company,
they
have
operations
both
within
and
without
michigan
must
determine
the
portion
of
their
tax
base
attributable
to
michigan
under
a
three-factor
formula.
this
formula
considers
property
payroll
and
sales
in
michigan
and
allocate
some
michigan
tax,
by
computing
these
to
the
tax
payer's
property,
payroll,
and
sales
nationwide.
in
1980,
trinova
had
little
property
and
payroll
within
michigan
but
made
sales
of
over
$100
million
in
that
state.
the
three-factor
apportionment
formula
attributed
9%
of
trinova's
total
business
activity
to
michigan.
trinova
paid
its
tax
to
michigan,
and
later
brought
this
refund
claim
in
a
challenge
to
the
apportionment
formula.
relying
upon
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses,
trinova
first
contends
that
apportionment
is
unwarranted
because
the
tax
base
is
largely
composed
of
the
elements
of
compensation
and
appreciation,
and
that
these
items
can
be
geographically
located.
we
reject
that
argument.
the
premise
that
the
michigan
tax
can
be
analyzed,
as
if
it
were
separate
taxes
upon
compensation,
depreciation
and
income
is
not
found.
the
taxes
upon
a
different
bona
fide
measure
of
business
activity,
the
value
added.
the
tax
base
includes
the
element
of
income
which
cannot
be
geographically
located,
but
the
result
that
the
tax
base
as
whole
cannot
geographically
located.
trinova's
approach
would
distort
the
theory
of
the
tax
and
will
not
adequately
account
for
the
contribution
of
michigan's
sales
to
value
added.
second,
trinova
contends
that
even
a
sum
of
portion
that
were
acceptable,
the
three-factor
formula
employed
here
lacks
the
required
rational
relation
to
trinova's
business
activity
in
michigan.
we
have
rejected
similar
challenges
to
the
three-factor
formula
in
the
income
tax
context.
our
reason
implies
also
where
the
formula
is
used
to
apportion
value
added.
further,
trinova
has
failed
to
provide
an
alternative
apportionment
which
would
give
any
effect
to
its
michigan
sales
or
acknowledge
that
value
added
is
more
than
merely
compensation
plus
depreciation.
finally,
trinova
cannot
demonstrate
any
facial
discrimination
or
other
violation
of
our
tests
for
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
in
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
steven
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
joins.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
