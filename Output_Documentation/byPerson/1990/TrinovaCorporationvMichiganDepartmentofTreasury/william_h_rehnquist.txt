we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1106,
trinova
corporation
v.
michigan
department
of
the
treasury.
mr.
sheldon.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
justice
scalia's
point
is
that
the
state
of
michigan
could
have
disregarded
the
site-specific
factors
and
taxed
you
solely
on
your
gross
receipts,
and
you
would
be
right
about
at
the
same
place.
in
fact,
you
would
probably
be
in
worse
shape.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr....
surely
michigan
is
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
sales
activity
of
trinova
to
purchasers
in
michigan,
presumably
automobile
companies,
is
going
to
bring
in
a
great
deal
of
revenue
to
trinova,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
does
michigan
have
to
settle
for
income?
why
can't
it
talk
about
revenue?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sheldon.
mr.
roesch,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roesch.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sheldon,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sheldon.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
