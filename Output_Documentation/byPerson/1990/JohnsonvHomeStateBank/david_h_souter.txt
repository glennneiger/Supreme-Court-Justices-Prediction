justice
souter
theoretically
is
your
position
as
simple
as
this.
that
chapter
7
in
effect
extinguishes
the
personal
obligation.
the
result
of
that
is
that
the
previous
in
rem
remedy
becomes
legally
an
interest
in
property
owned
by
somebody
else.
is
it
as
simple
as
that?
justice
souter
that's
why
it's
not
a
claim
anymore.
justice
souter
that's
it.
in
other
words,
it's
the...
the
so-called
in
rem
remedy
is
reduced
simply
to
an
interest
in
property
which
can
be
realized
upon
just
as
if
the
mortgagee
had
received
an
undivided
interest
as
a
common
owner.
it
could
go
ahead
and
realize
upon
its
property
in
that
case.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
well,
mr.
gilman,
in
your
answer
when
he
pledges
the
property
on
a
nonrecourse
basis,
he
still
couldn't
realize
against
that
property
if
he
did
not
have
the
antecedent
or
the
independent
debt,
right?
equity
wouldn't
let
him
do
it.
justice
souter
no,
i'm
saying
he
gets
a
pledge
of
the
property.
he
can't
enforce
against
that
pledge
without
having
the
antecedent
debt.
justice
souter
if
the...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
the
debtor
comes
along
and
pays
him
100
percent
of
the
debt,
no
court
is
going
to
let
him
sell
the
property.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
souter
all
right.
then
isn't
the
kind
of
the
ultimate
answer
to
the
problem
that's
being
put
to
you
the
one
which
you
gave
to
me
and
i
think
gave
to
justice
stevens.
in
the
situation
that
we've
got,
the
chapter
7
proceeding
extinguishes
the
antecedent
debt...
it
distinguishes
the
personal
obligation,
and
therefore,
it
distinguishes
the
claim
against
property
as
that
term
is
used.
something
has
got
to
be
left.
and
what's
left
is
a
pure
property
interest
owned
by
the
bank.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
souter
and
it's
a
property
interest,
pure
and
simple.
it's
not
a
claim.
justice
souter
whereas
in
the
pledge
situation,
it's
not
just
a
property
interest,
pure
and
simple,
because
the
right
to
realize
upon
it
is
still
dependent
upon
the
relationship
of
debtor
and
creditor,
which
is
independent
of
it.
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
is
it
fair
to...
i'm
sorry...
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
your
answer.
justice
souter
may...
may
i
just
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question?
is
it
correct
to
say
this...
that
the
identification
of
this
property
interest
is
dependent
upon
two
valuations.
one
is
the
extent
of
the
antecedent
debt
plus
interest
and
so
on,
collection
costs...
whatever
the
agreement
originally
provided.
and
number
two,
is
subject
to
the
limitation
of
the
actual
value
of
the
property
so
that
a
debtor
after
chapter
7...
a
creditor
after
chapter
7,
that
is...
could
have
an
interest
in
the
value
of
the
property
defined
by...
the
extent
of
which
is
defined
by
the
antecedent
debt,
provided
that
that
does
not
exceed
the
value
of
the
property...
the
value
of
the
property
always
being
the
ultimate
limit.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
in
fact,
maybe
that...
maybe
my
question
reflects
a
confusion.
is
the...
is
the
extent
of
his
interest,
i.e.,
the
value
that
may
be
ultimately
realized
out
of
the
property...
is
that
determined
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding
so
that...
so
that
that's
all
behind
him
at
that
point?
justice
souter
yes,
in
chapter
7
does
the...
does
the
bankruptcy
court
in
effect
say,
look,
you
own
a
piece
of
property...
you
own
this
property
to
the
extent
of
$10,000.
is
that
what
they...
is
that
the
result
of
chapter
7?
justice
souter
so
he
knows
the
extent...
the
dollar
amount
at
least...
of
his
interest
once
chapter
7
is
over.
justice
souter
okay.
