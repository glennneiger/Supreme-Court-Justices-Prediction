mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
where
the
court
has
been
asked
to
decide
whether
an
in
rem
liability
that
survives
a
chapter
7
discharge
is
a
claim
as
defined
in
the
bankruptcy
code
in
a
subsequently
filed
chapter
13
bankruptcy.
the
court
below
held
that
such
a
liability
is
not
a
claim.
we
respectfully
contend
that
that
decision
should
be
reversed.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code
requires
a
reversal.
the
essential
factual
background
in
this
case
is
as
follows.
curtis
johnson
operates
a
farm
near
belpre,
kansas.
in
1984,
he
defaulted
on
his
loan
to
the
home
state
bank
in
lewis,
kansas.
on
march
23,
1984,
the
bank
initiated
a
state
court
foreclosure
proceeding.
at
that
time
the
bank
was
the
owner
of
the
second
mortgage
on
the
property
at...
in
question.
later,
the
bank
acquired
the
first
mortgage,
which
was
previously
owned
by
travelers
insurance
company.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
first
mortgage
which
was
owned
by
travelers
insurance
company
and
is
now
owned
by
the
bank
has
never
been
foreclosed.
as
we
stand
here
today
that
mortgage
is
not
foreclosed.
also,
it's
important
to
note
that
both
mortgages
contain
provisions
of
assigning
oil
and
gas
proceeds
in
the
event
of
a
default.
on
october
9,
1984,
mr.
and
mrs.
johnson
filed
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy.
they
received
their
discharge
in
that
bankruptcy
on
april
11,
1985.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
correct.
no
reaffirmation
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
bank
or
the
johnsons
in
the
chapter
7
bankruptcy.
about
the
time
of
the
discharge,
the
bank
obtained
relief
from
stay
and
continued
with
its
foreclosure
action
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
no,
in
fact
the...
in
the
chapter
7
procedure
the
bank
was
what
we
call
undersecured,
meaning
that
there
was
no
equity
in
this
property
whatsoever.
the
general
creditors
in
the
chapter
7
did
receive
a
dividend
from
other
property
that
was
nonexempt,
but
it
wasn't
from
the
equity
in
the
property
that's
at
issue
in
the
foreclosure.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
absolutely.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
it's
made
as
of
a
matter
of
course,
and
it
was
in
this
case,
yes.
they
participated
in
the
unsecured
class
of
creditors
and
received
a
dividend
from
the...
from
the
nonexempt
property
along
with
the
rest
of
the
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
no,
in
this
case
what
it
was
was
oil
and
gas
proceeds
that
had
accrued
before
the
filing
of
the
chapter
7
and
were
in
suspense
and
were
available
for
the
trustee
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding
to
take
charge
of
as
first
creditor.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
those
were
the
only...
as
i
recall
those
were
the
only
assets
available
for
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
contend
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
me
and
allows
the
serial
filing
that
the
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
take
up
those
issues
that
the
bank
raised
in
their
appeal
from
the
bankruptcy
court
to
the
district
court.
the
bank
obtained
their
judgment
and
foreclosure
by
summary
judgment
and
proceeded
with
the
sheriff's
sale.
the
bank
was
the
successful
bidder
at
the
sheriff's
sale
and
purchased
the
property
in
that
means.
thereafter,
the
johnsons
appealed--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--excuse
me?
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
yes.
thereafter
the
johnsons
appealed
the
sale
procedure
in
the
foreclosure
to
the
kansas
supreme
court,
which
reversed
the
decision
regarding
the
sale
and
remanded
the
matter
back
to
the
state
trial
court
for
another
sale.
before
the
second
sale
could
be
conducted,
curtis
johnson
filed
the
instant
chapter
13
bankruptcy
that's
at
issue
here.
that
was
filed
on
march
2,
1987,
and
the
only
debt
scheduled
in
that
bankruptcy
were
the
in
rem
liabilities
that
passed
through
the
chapter
7
discharge.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
in
filing
the
chapter
13?
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
his
purpose
is
to
try
to
retain
ownership
in
his
farmland.
and
what
he's
proposing
to
do
in
the--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--well,
it's
true
that
it
did
delay
the
foreclosure,
but--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--no,
i
think
his
honest
purpose
was
to
try
to
pay
for
his
land
and
retain
his
land.
there
was
really
no
specific
reason
to
delay
the
foreclosure.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
correct.
and
under--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--no
question
about
that.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
chapter
13
is
to
string
out
the
payment--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--right,
and
chapter
13--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--yes,
in
chapter
13
it's...
it's
an
almost
automatic
cram-down
as
opposed
to
in
chapter
11
where
you
have
to
do
more--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--that's
correct.
the
foreclosure
is
stayed
automatically
under
section
362
by
the
filing
of
the
chapter
13
petition.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
oh,
yes.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
oh,
yes.
and
there...
this
was
a
heated,
contested
confirmation
of
this
client.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
it'd
be...
it
would
be
dismissed.
if
the
creditor...
if
the
debtor
did
not
make
his
payments
under
the
plan
after
it
was
confirmed
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
case
would
be
dismissed.
the
automatic
stay
would
be
lifted,
and
they
would
proceed
with
their
foreclosure
action
and
sale.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
in
the
chapter
13
proceeding,
the
interests
of
the
debtor
take...
have
a
greater
weight
than
the
interest
of
the
creditor,
in
my
view.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
well,
the
amount
that's
listed
is
the
amount
that's
owed.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
secured
or
not--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--it
can
call
for
payment
of
0
percent
of
the
unsecured
debt
scheduled
and
be
confirmed.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
in
my
experience,
this
happened
a
couple
of
times.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
but--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--that's
normally
when
it
does
happen.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
no.
it
couldn't
be
confirmed
in
that
situation.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
the
debt...
no,
the
debt...
the
claim
would
be
allowed
in
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
collateral
and
you
would
have
to
propose
in
your
plan
to
pay
the
value
of
the
collateral--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--the
entire
value
of
the
collateral.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
no,
under
section
506
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
amount...
the
amount
of
the
secured
debt
is
tied
to
the
value
of
the
collateral.
and
that's
where
we
come
up
with
the
term
"undersecured".
so
if
the
property
is
worth
$100,000,
but
the
bank
has
a
debt
against
it
or
a
mortgage
and...
and
a
note
worth
$150,000,
their
secured
claim
is
only
$100,000,
and
in
chapter
13
that's
what
he'd
have
to
pay.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
the
nut
of
the
issue
here.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
the...
the
debt
has
been
discharged
and
the
question
is
what
is
the
effect
of
a
discharge
on
a
debt.
and
it's
clear
under
the
bankruptcy
code
that
the
discharge
in
a
bankruptcy
prohibits
a
creditor
from
proceeding
with
in
personam
rights
but
that
in
rem
rights
pass
through
the
discharge.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
yes,
section
5--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--that's
correct.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
well,
i
want
to
use
the
terms
claim
and
debt
coextensively
as
we
learned
in
davenport.
and
yes,
i
do
claim
that
the
claim
against
the
property
is
a
debt
and
a
claim.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
no,
a
secured
debt...
a
lien
passes
through
a
chapter--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
well,
the
reason
we
have
to
show
that
there...
that
the
bank
has
a
claim
is
because
in
order
to
address
the
claim
in
the
bankruptcy,
the
claim
has
to
exist.
if
they
don't
have
a
claim
in
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--well,
section--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--109
provides
that
section--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--section
109
is
the
eligibility
provisions...
is
the
eligibility
statute,
and
that
says
that
they
have
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
claims
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy.
but
i
think
the
operative
provision
that
you're
asking
me
about
is
section
1325
which
provides
what
must
be
set
forth
in
a
chapter
13
plan
in
order
to
be
confirmed,
and
the
word
claim
and/or
debt
is
used
throughout
that
statue.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
he
was
not
eligible
at
the
time
to
file
a
chapter
13
because
he
had
too
much
debt.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
essentially
that's
correct.
our...
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code
requires
a
reversal.
as
i
mentioned
section
101(4)
is
the
definitional
provision
at
issue.
it
defines
the
term
"claim"
and
the
phrase
that's
key
in
that
definition
is
"right
to
payment".
the
rights
the
bank
has
are
to
receive
the
land
as
a
result
of
the
foreclosure
or
to
receive
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
land
if
the
bank
is
not
the
successful
bidder
at
a
foreclosure
sale.
and
in
addition,
the
bank
has
the
right
to
receive
oil
and
gas
income
from
the
land.
the
question
of
whether
that...
whether
or
not
that
fits
in
the
common
term
of
the
word
"payment"
i
don't
think
is
really
up
to
dispute.
i
think
it's
common
practice
and
commonly
understood
that
collateral
is
taken
as
an
alternative
source
of
payment.
banks
typically
take
collateral
to
make
sure
they're
paid
in
full
or
in
part
and...
and
in
case
the
debtor
does
not
pay
the
debt.
in
fact,
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
couple
of
occasions
that
collateral
constitutes
payment.
in
united
savings
v.
timbers
of
inwood
forest,
the
court
stated
that
it
is
common
ground
that
the
interest
and
property
referred
to
by
section
362(d)(1)
includes
the
right
of
a
secured
creditor
to
have
the
security
applied
in
payment
of
the
debt
upon
completion
of
the
reorganization.
similarly,
in
long
v.
bullard
the
court
states
that
on
the
9th
of
february,
1878,
bullard
brought
suit
in
the
superior
court
of
bib
county,
georgia,
to
subject
the
property
to
the
payment
of
his
debt.
and
finally,
even
the
kansas
bankers
associate...
association,
who
filed
the
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
bank,
admits
in
their
brief...
probably
unintentionally...
that
collateral
rights
constitute
a
source
of
payment.
they
say
at
page
13
on
the
brief
that
kansas
banks,
like
other
creditors,
enter
into
loan
transactions
secured
by
real
property
with
an
expectation
that
debtors
will
not
be
allowed
to
manipulate
the
bankruptcy
code
to
frustrate
the
creditor's
contractual
right
to
apply
the
value
of
collateral
to
satisfy
the
loan
obligations.
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
also
recognize
that
rights
in
collateral
constitute
a
right
to
payment.
as
i
mentioned,
section
1325
bears
directly
on
this
issue.
it
provides
that
in
order
for
a...
it
provides
that
a
credit
or
a
debtor
can
propose
a
plan
where
he
proposes
to
transfer
the
property
that
the
secured
creditor
has
a
security
interest
from
a
mortgage
in
and
satisfaction
of
the
secured
claim.
that's
also
true
with
regard
to
section...
or
chapter
12,
in
section
1225(a)(5)
and
in
chapter
11,
in
section
1129(b)(2)(a)(3)
dealing
with
the
indubitable
equivalent.
so
we
believe
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
requires
a
reversal.
but
i
now
want
to
examine
the
question
of
whether
the
plain
meaning
fits
within
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
we
believe
it
does.
if
a...
if
an
in
rem
right
is
not
a
claim
in
bankruptcy...
excuse
me...
the
section...
excuse
me...
section
102(2),
in
my
view
would
be
rendered
worthless.
section
102(2)
provides
that
a
claim
against
the
debtor
includes
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor.
in
my
view
that's
a
direct
statement
by
congress
that
in
rem
rights
constitute
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
because
in
section
524,
congress
specifically
said
that
only
the
in
personam
rights
are
dischargeable
in
chapter
7
or
any
other
chapter
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
yes,
i
do.
also,
section--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--well,
what
they
eventually
did
was
pass
chapter
12,
your
honor,
for
farmers,
which
is
specifically
the
problem
that
was
being
encountered
throughout
the...
especially
the
midwest.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
but
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--but
on
the
other
hand,
they
didn't
limit
it
anywhere
in
the
code.
there's...
the
only
limitation
on
filing
after
the
chapter
7
in
section
109
in
the--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--well--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--that's
true,
but
i...
i
think
that
the
plain
language
and
also
the
decision
in
davenport
requires
a
holding
that
an
in
rem
right
is
a...
is
a
claim.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
exactly.
that's
exactly
my
point.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
no,
well,
i'm
saying
that
they
did
not
pass
anything
that
would
prohibit
my
client
from
filing
a
chapter
13
after
he
gets
a
discharge
on
chapter
7.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
but
that...
but
that's
not
in
the
statute,
and
i
think
section
102(2)
belies
that
statement.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
well,
if
congress
did
not
mean
to
include
in
rem
liabilities
as
claims,
then
i
don't
see
what
the
purpose
of
section
102(2)
was.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
i
agree
with
that.
and
i'd
be
happy
to
go
into
the
other
parts
of
the
statute
that
i
think
help
support
my
reasoning.
the
next
one
i
would
go
to
is
section
502(b)(1)
which
states
that
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
will
be
allowed
unless
the
claim
is
unenforceable
against
the
debtor
and
property
of
the
debtor,
which
means
that
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
will
be
allowed
if
a
creditor
has
a
claim
against
the
debtor
personally
or
against
his
property.
that
to
me
seems
another...
seems
to
be
another
clear
statement
that
in
rem
liabilities
should
constitute
claims
in
this
bankruptcy.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
the
language
of
the
statute
is
unless
it's
unenforceable
against
the
debtor
and
property
of
the
debtor.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
that's
true,
and
i
believe
that
the...
the
way
i
understand
that
section
is
that
i...
in
either
case.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
it
says
it
will
be--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--it
says
it
will
be
allowed
unless
the
claim
is
unenforceable.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
both.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
and
in
this
case,
it's
enforceable
against
property
of
the
debtor
and
therefore
the
claim
will
be
allowed.

gilman
section
502(b)(1).
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
i
don't
have--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--can
i--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--it
should
be
on
page
22.
it's
not
set
forth
verbatim
in
that--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--i
assumed
that
the
court
would
have
available
the
statutes
to
look
at.
i
apologize
if
that's
an
error,
too.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
also,
in...
touching
on
section
524
which
justice
white
keeps
referring
to,
i
believe
that
section
also
supports
the
notion
that
a
claim...
an
in
rem
liability
is
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy.
that
section
says
that
a
discharge
in
a
case
under
this
title
operates
as
an
injunction
against
the
commencement
or
continuation
of
an
action,
the
employment
of
process,
or
an
act
to
collect,
recover,
or
offset
any
such
debt
as
a
personal
liability
of
the
debtor.
the
phrase
"as
a
personal
liability
of
the
debtor.
"
modifies
the
term
debt
and
implies
at
least
that
some
other
type
of
liability
must
exist
besides
a
personal
liability.
if
it's
not
a
personal
liability,
it's
my
view
it
has
to
be
an
in
rem
liability.
also,
congress
demonstrated
that
it
knew
how
to
limit
the
term
claim
to
in
personam
situations
when
it
wanted
to.
in
section
303(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
sets
forth
the
situations
where
an
involuntary
petition
can
be
filed
against
an
individual.
the
language
of
that
section
makes
clear
that
in
order
to--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--i
don't
believe
i
cited
it
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
it
was
cited
by
the
amicus
in
its
brief.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
i
apologize,
your
honor.
i
was
just
making
my
argument
if
i
can.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
i'll
make
sure
that
i
don't,
your
honor.
that
section
makes
clear
that
a
claim
or
an
involuntary
action
can
only
be
initiated
against
an
individual
when
there
is
an
in
personam
claim
against
that
individual.
also,
i
believe
that
recent
activity
in
congress
demonstrates
that
they
continue
to
support
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
"claim".
as
the
court
will
recall
last
term
it
entered
its
decision
in
pennsylvania
department
of
public
welfare
v.
davenport.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
restitution
obligations
imposed
in
conjunction
with
criminal
penalties
constitute
claims
and
are
therefore
dischargeable
in
chapter
13
bankruptcies.
congress
reacted
to
that
decision
with
the
criminal
victims
protection
act
of
1990.
it's
important
to
look
at
what
both
congress
did
and
did
not
do.
the
way
congress
reacted
to
it
was
by
amending
section
1328
to
provide
that
restitution
obligations
are
not
dischargeable
in
chapter
13.
even
though
the
court
in
davenport
concentrated
heavily
on
the
construction
of
the
word
"claim",
congress
did
not
amend
the
definition
of
claim
and
allowed
that
definition
to
remain
unchanged
even
after
the
decision
in
davenport.
and
therefore,
i
believe
that
congress,
having
noted
the
decision
in
davenport,
would
continue
to
support
a
broad
construction
of
the
term
"claim"
which
would
include
an
in
rem
liability.
lastly,
i
want
to
touch
on
what
justice
white,
i
believe,
keeps
continuing
to
hit
on,
and
that
is
whether
this...
what
we're
proposing
to
do
here
is
fair.
is
it
fair
to
the
creditor
for
what
we
are
proposing
to
do?
and
we
believe
it
is,
because
had
curtis
johnson--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--well,
maybe
i'm
picking
that
up
from
your
argument--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--had
curtis
johnson
been
available...
had
available
chapter
12
at
the
time
he
had
to
file
his
chapter
7,
he
could
have
proposed
exactly
the
same
treatment
that
he's
proposing
in
this
case
to
the
bank.
in
other
words,
he
could
have
proposed
a
plan
in
chapter
12
which
would
have
provided
for
no
payments
to
unsecured
creditors
and
would
have
provided
only
for
the
payment
of
the
value
of
the
collateral
the
bank
holds.
and
that
plan
would
have
been
confirmable
in
a
chapter
12
proceeding
as
long
as
he
demonstrated
he
was
using
all
of
his
disposable
income.
all
we
are
asking
to
be
able
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
allow
curtis
johnson
to
pay
the
bank
the
value
of
its
collateral
at
the
bank's
contractual
rate
of
interest
over
a
period
of
5
years.
and
we
don't
believe
that
is
unfair.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
that's
all
i
have
at
this
point.
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
clear
up
a
couple
little
points
here.
one,
the
amount
of
the...
the
amount
the
bank
can
receive
when
they
go
through
the
foreclosure
depends
on
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
document,
irrespective
of
the...
well,
irrespective
of
the
note
after
the
chapter
7
discharge.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
right.
so
in
this
case
what
happened
was
the
amount
of
the
note
was
for
roughly
$350,000,
but
the
bank
never
increased
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
from
the
original
$100,000,
and
so
therefore,
their
in
rem
amount
is
determined
by
the
$100,000
mortgage
amount.
the
remainder
of
the...
of
the
promissory
note
has
been
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
that's
in
the
foreclosure.
in
the...
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
amount
of
the
claim
is
determined
both
by
the
amount
on
the
mortgage,
which
is
$100,000,
and
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property
so
that
if
the
property
was
worth
$110,000,
they
would
be
oversecured
but
their
claim
would
only
be
allowed
for
$100,000.
if
it
was
worth
$90,000,
even
though
they
had
a--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--the
10
would
be
equity
for
the
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
the
value
of
the
mortgage.
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
but--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--you
use
both
the
value
of
the
property
and
the...
and
the
amount
of
the
mortgage.
in
other
words,
if
the
mortgage
amount
is
more
than
the
value
of
the
property,
then
it...
the
amount
of
the
claim
in
the
13
will
be
the
value
of
the
property.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
mortgage
amount
is
less
than
the
value
of
the
property,
then
the
amount
of
the
claim
will
be
just
the
mortgage
amount.
i
wanted
to
touch
also
on
justice
souter's--
mr.
w.
thomas
gilman
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
