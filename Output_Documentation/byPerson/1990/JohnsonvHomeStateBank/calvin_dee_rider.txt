mr.
calvin
dee
rider
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
tenth
circuit
decision,
because
it
correctly
found
that
an
in
rem
remedy
is
not
a
claim.
we
tend
to
address
two
areas
that
exemplify
the
soundness
of
the
tenth
circuit
decision.
first,
the
tenth
circuit
took
into
account
the
chapter
7
filing
and
the
effect
of
the
discharge.
and
second,
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
there
is
no
claim,
no
right
to
payment,
and
no
nonrecourse
loan
agreement.
the
tenth
circuit
decision
can
also
be
affirmed
on
the
alternative
ground
or
alternative
issue
of
good
faith.
now,
for
many
years
the
status
quo
between
debtors
and
creditors
has
been
maintained.
in
rem
rights
have
been
preserved
under
the
act
and
the
bankruptcy
codes
so
that
creditors
can
proceed.
those
creditors'
rights
are
preserved
to
proceed
against
property
that's
securing
the
debts
that
are
being
discharged
in
the
7...
chapter
7.
now,
recently
some
courts
have
judicially
created
a
chapter
20
bankruptcy,
which
for...
in
this
instance
chapter
20
is
the
filing
of
a
chapter
13
after
receiving
the
discharge
in
a
7.
these
other
courts
have
gone
beyond
the
confines
and
intent
of
the
code.
what
the
tenth
circuit
decision
is...
does
is
bring
this
back
within
the
purpose,
spirit,
and
intent
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
if
an
in
rem
remedy
is
a
claim
for
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
then
every
mortgage,
home
loan,
farm
loan,
commercial
loan
would
be
improperly
affected
and
impaired.
secured
parties
will
lose
their
bargained
for
state
law
contractual
rights
to
realize
on
their
security
their
collateral
that
is
securing
the...
the
debts
that
are
being
discharged
in
the
chapter
7.
upon
a
default,
the
secured
party
would
have
no
right.
if
bankruptcy
is
filed,
there
would
be
really
no
reason
to
lift
the
automatic
stay
because
creditors
could
not
proceed
against
the
property
which
secured
the
debt
because
that
right
to
proceed,
that
in
rem
remedy,
would
be
a
dischargeable
claim
or
debt
in
bankruptcy.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
destroy
or
impair
in
this
way
a
secured
party's
rights
in
a
collateral.
in
this--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--the--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--to
a
point,
justice
souter.
the
in
rem
remedy
passes
through
the
chapter
7
and
it's
a
right...
the
interest
in
property
belongs
to
the
creditor...
to
the
mortgagee.
and
the
mortgagee
is
simply
trying
to
realize
on
its
own
property
interest--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--yes,
the
mortgagee
can
proceed
and
realize
upon
that
property.
sure.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
history
in
the...
in
its
xx
case
and
louisville
v.
radford
case
that
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--before
the
chapter
7
discharge...
excuse
me,
justice
stevens,
are
you
talking
about
the
interest
in
property?
the
bank's
interest
in
property?
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
before
the
chapter
7
discharge,
the
estate...
the
chapter
7
estate...
either
had
the
property
or--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--in
this
instance,
the
debtor--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--yes,
and
the...
or
the
debtor
would
hold
the
property
and
the
debtor
would
have
the
property.
and
yes,
upon
that
discharge,
all
the
debtor
has
left
is...
is
an
interest
in
the
property
at
a
redemption
right.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
the...
upon
the
discharge,
the
debtor
has
possession
of
the
property.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
well,
the
bank...
the
bank
has
that
in
rem...
in
rem
right
before
the
chapter--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--i
may
have
misunderstood
justice
souter's
question.
the
bank
has
that
in
rem
remedy
before
the
chapter
7
filing--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--and
still
has
that
in
rem
remedy
after
the
chapter
7
discharge.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that...
that
is
one
of
our
positions.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
it
is
not
a
claim,
and
the
long
recognized
history
that
these
mortgage
liens
passed
through--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
the
in
rem
remedy
against
the
property
is
not
discharged.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
in
the
bullard
case
and
this
court's
case
of...
in
louisville
v.
radford,
it's
been
long
recognized
that
the
bankruptcy
does
not
destroy
a
mortgage
even
on
exempt
property.
and
what
we're...
what
we're
asking
here
is
essentially
what
justice
stevens
stated
in
the
unanimous
view
of
the...
of
this
court
in
butner
v.
united
states
that
the
mortgagee
should
be
afforded
in
federal
bankruptcy
court
the
same
protection
it
would
have
under
state
law
if
no
bankruptcy
had
ensued.
now,
in
this
case,
johnson
filed
the
chapter
7
liquidation,
received
the
discharge,
received
the
benefits
of
that
chapter
7
bankruptcy,
freedom
from
unsecured
debt
and
fresh
start,
but
wanted
to
hold
on
and
not
give
up
the
property
even
after
the...
even
after
the
lifting
of
the
stay,
which
was
about
the
same
time
as
the
discharge.
the
discharge...
the
automatic
stay
was
lifted
so
the
bank
could
proceed
in
rem
against
the
property.
but
they
were
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
subsequent
filing
of
7.
it's
our
position
that
the
purpose
of
the
chapter
7
was
never
completed
or
satisfied.
the
bank
was
never
able
to
attempt
to
realize
or
to
realize
on
that
property.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
mr.
chief
justice,
our
response
is
that
there...
the
specific
prohibition
is
not
there,
but
there
are
other
code
provisions,
specifically
one
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
code
section
706
that
allows
a
one-time
conversion
from
a
chapter
7
to
a
13.
if
the
debtor
finds
it...
finds
himself
or
herself
in
a
chapter
7
with
some
nondischargeable
debts
that
are...
or
debts
that
can't
be
discharged
in
a
7,
the
debtor
has
that
one-time
right
to
convert
to
a
13
if
they
meet
the
debt
limits
of
the
chapter
that
they're
going
to...
the
chapter...
which
is
chapter
13.
and
this--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
congress
contemplated
a
debtor
moving
into...
filing
a
7,
if
he
can't...
if
there's
nondischargeable
debts,
they
can
move
on.
what
the
petitioner...
the
debtor
is
attempting
to
do
in
this
case
is
what
was
specifically
prohibited
by
section
706.
and
also
cannot
do
that
because...
the
debtor
cannot
do
that
because
of
the
debt
limit
that
they
had.
the
debtor
had
approximately
five
times
the
amount
of
debt
that
a
chapter
13
would
allow.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
it's
the
same
one.
the
debtor
would
have
had
the
opportunity.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that's...
that
is--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--under
the
chapter
13.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that's
correct.
and
also,
as
a
further
question,
even
if...
as
a
further
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
even
if
the
debtor
was...
could
meet
the
eligibility
requirement
of
chapter
13
we
submit
that
the
provisions
of
706
indicate
congressional
intent
that
the
conversion
method
be
used
rather
than
the
discharge
in
7
of
the
debt,
and
then
moving
on
to
the
13.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
the
father
could
still
file
a
13...
can
still...
would
still
be
able
to
schedule
debts
in
a
13.
but
in
that
case,
if
the
property...
if
there
was
no
right
to
payment...
if
the
creditor
has
no
right
to
payment,
that
property
could
not
be
scheduled.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
justice
stevens--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--no,
no,
that...
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
no,
justice
stevens,
that
you
still
must
have
a
right
to
payment
from
that
debt
or
you
still
must
have
a
claim
and
that...
while
that
debtor
could
file
a
chapter
13,
he
could
not
schedule
that
specific
property
in
the...
in
his
chapter
13.
the
tenth
circuit
recognized
the
effect
of
the
chapter
7
discharge.
first
as
we
discussed
the
effect
of
the
discharged
lowered
the
amount
of
unsecured
debts.
secondly,
under
727(b)
a
discharge
is
a
discharge
of
all
debts
and
any
liability
of
a
claim
except
those
specific
debts
that
are
enumerated
in
section
5.3
that
are
nondischargeable.
the
debtor
comes
out
of
a
chapter
7
with
a
fresh
start,
no
claims,
no
debts,
no
obligations.
but
petitioner
is
saying
that
somehow
a
debt
or
a
claim
escaped
or
survived
the
chapter
7
discharge.
we
submit
that
that
is
inconsistent
that,
upon
the
discharge
of
all
debts,
that
that
creates
a
debt.
or
upon
the
discharge
of
any
liability
of
a
claim,
that
creates
a
claim.
but
yet
what
we
have
here
is
an
in
rem
remedy,
a
remedy
of
the
bank,
the
right
to
foreclose.
it's
not
a...
and
if
it
is
a
in
rem...
if
an
in
rem
remedy
is
a
claim
or
a
debt,
it
could
be
discharged
in
7.
we
submit
that
that
was
never
the
intent
of
congress.
the
in
rem
remedy
in
this
case
arose...
as
i
believe
i
discussed
with
justice
stevens...
arose
before
the
chapter
7
bankruptcy.
the
in
rem
remedy
was
a
pre-petition
remedy,
along
with
the
debt
that
was
discharged.
those
were
together
before
the
chapter
7.
on
section
101(9)
defines
creditor
as
a
claim
against
the
debtor
that
arose
at
the
time
of
or
before
the
order
for
relief,
which
the
order
for
relief
is
the
petition.
a
creditor
is
someone
that
has
a
claim
against
the
debtor
before
the
filing
of
the
petition.
now,
if
we
were
a
creditor
and
we
were
in
chapter
7
because
of
discharged
debts...
if
we
were
a
creditor
in
that
chapter
7,
according
to
the
discharge
provisions,
again,
of
727(b),
it
provides
a
discharge
of
all
debts
and
claims
that
arose
before
the
order
for
relief,
before
the
filing
of
the
petition.
now,
all
of
those
occurred
before
the
7.
if
an
in
rem
remedy
is
a
claim,
it's
discharged
in
the
7.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
first--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--this--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--it
is
our
contention,
justice
scalia,
this
isn't
a
claim
against
property
of
the...
of
the
debtor.
to
have
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor
in
section
102(2),
you
must
still
have
a
claim,
a
claim
against
the
debtor.
you
must
still
have
a
right
to
payment...
either
a
right
to
payment
or
a
right
to
an
equitable
remedy
for
breach
of
performance,
if
such
breach
gives
rise
to
a
right
to
payment--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--you
must
still...
the
strict
language
of
the
code
talks
about
a
claim
against
the
debtor
including
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor.
and
it
is
our
belief
and
our
contention
that
you
must
still
have
that
claim.
we
don't
have
a
claim
under
101(4)(a),
a
right
to
payment.
we
are
not
seeking
to
pursue
a
nonexistent
claim
against
the
debtor.
what
we
have
is
a
right
to
an
equitable
remedy.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
i
believe
in...
you
may
have
an
example
where
a...
for
instance
a
farmer.
a
farmer
would
come
into
the
bank,
take
a
loan,
pledge
property,
and
also
pledge
additional
security.
here
is
my
property.
i'm
just
pledging
this
property
with
no
personal
liability...
enter
into
a
so-called
nonrecourse
loan
agreement
with
the
bank
where
it's
just
this
property.
the
bank
still...
would
still
hold
a
claim,
and
they
would
hold
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor.
the
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor
wasn't
defined
in
the
code...
or
in
the
pre-code,
in
the
act
it's
a
difficult
concept.
one
thing
that
we
have
considered
is
also
in
this
case
is
this
property
of
the
debtor,
upon
the
commencement
of
a
case,
all
interests
of
the
debtor
go
into
the
estate.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--the--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
i
believe
that
is
our
position
that
we
have
the
property
interest
to
pursue
against
our
collateral--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
in
the
nonrecourse
loan
agreement?
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes,
in
that
case.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
in
this
case,
we
do
not...
to
further
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
we
do
not
have
a
right
to
payment,
and
in
the
second
definition
of
claim...
the
right
to
an
equitable
remedy
for
breach
of
performance
if
such
breach
gives
rise
to
a
right
to
payment.
now,
normally
in
kansas,
a
right
to
an
equitable...
or
excuse
me...
foreclosure
in
kansas
is
an
equitable
remedy.
and
that
equitable
remedy
normally
gives
rise
to
a
right
to
payment,
but
because
of
the
discharge,
we
have
no
right
to
payment.
there
is
nothing,
as
in
section
101(4)(b),
nothing
for
the
debtor
to
breach
that
would
give
rise
to
the
right
to
payment.
and
even
if
there
was
a
breach,
that
breach
would
not
give
rise
to
a
right
to
payment,
because
every...
all
rights
to
payments
have
been...
have
been
discharged
in
the
chapter
7
bankruptcy.
now,
we
recognize,
as
this
court
did
in
davenport,
that
claims
are
to
be
construed
to
contain
all
legal
obligations
of
the
debtor.
first,
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
legal
obligation
of
the
debtor...
not
an
enforceable
obligation.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that's...
we
must
look
at
the
document
to
determine
what
was
there
even...
but...
even
though
all
of
that
has
been
discharged
and
there's
no
personal
liability
on
it.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
in
this
case
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
claim...
congress,
in
this
specific
instance,
limited
the
definition
of
claim
in
101(4)(b),
where
congress
stated
in
the
legislative
history
that
rights
to
an
equitable
remedy
for
breach
of
performance
with
respect
to
which
such
breach
does
not
give
rise
to
a
right
to
payment,
are
not
claims.
and
therefore,
they
would
not
be
susceptible
to
discharge
and
bankruptcy.
the
definition
of
claim
is
specifically
limited
there
and
we're...
to
the
specific
instance
and
circumstances
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
to...
to
an
extent,
justice
souter.
the
value
that
a...
that
value
that
a
creditor
seeks
after
the...
after
the
discharge
or
the
creditor
seeks
during
the
foreclosure
is
the
value
of
the
entire
judgment.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
the
value
of
the
property?
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
but
then
you
move
on
to
the
chapter
13
and
that
value
is
determined
again.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
in
the
chapter
7,
if...
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
debtor
retains
the
property,
chief
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
then
the
debtor
retains
that
right
of
redemption.
it's
our
position
that
a
right
of
redemption
is
not
a
right
to
payment.
that's
an
interest
of
the
debtor
and
property,
which
isn't
necessarily
property
of
the
debtor,
but
it's
an
interest
of
the
debtor
and
property.
a
right
of
redemption...
and
this
debtor
still
has
that
right
of
redemption--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--he
still...
even...
this
plan
is
set
to
conclude
in
less
than
a
year.
it's
a
5-year
plan.
the
banks
only
received
the
one
payment
during
that
plan.
and
it
will
conclude
next
march.
the
debtor
still
has
that
right
of
redemption.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
both,
your
honor.
he...
he
had
it
at
the
conclusion
of
the
chapter
7.
and
essentially
that's
what
the
debtor
is
doing
is
extending
that
right
of
redemption
period.
that's
the
only
interest
he
has.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes.
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
right
of
redemption,
it's
a
right
of
the
debtor.
it's
not
a
right
to
payment.
we
cannot
require
this
debtor...
we
cannot
enforce
this
debtor
to
redeem
that
property.
and
furthermore,
the
redemption
is
something
that...
when
the
debtor
redeems,
the
debtor
redeems
at
one
time...
redeems
the
full
judgment--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--exactly.
and
they
must
pay
the
judgment,
the
cost,
the
interest,
the
property
taxes
upon
the
right
to
redeem...
not
as
a
debtor
in
chapter
13
is
scheduling
value...
value
of
land.
and
that...
the
redemption
must
be
paid
within
that
6
months,
not
5
years.
or
in
this
case
it's
been
approximately
7.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
no,
the
bank...
the...
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
property
is
increasing
in
value?
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
i...
in
that
specific
instance,
justice
stevens,
that's
something
that
i'm
not
exactly
clear
on.
i
know
the
bank
has
the
right
to
that
value,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
have
the
value...
have
the
right
to
what's
left,
because
there
would
be
nothing--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
oh,
yes,
yes,
i'm
sorry.
yes,
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
the
full...
the
full
amount--
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
--yes,
of
their
claim.
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
that's
correct.
the
full
amount
of
their
undersecured
claim.
i
thought
that
justice
stevens
was
talking
about
under...
unsecured
in
the
chapter
7.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
if
the
value
of
their
claim
is...
their
allowed
claim,
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
from
what
i...
what
i've
discussed
with
justice
scalia,
the
value...
the
value
of
their
allowed...
the
bank
is
entitled
to
the
value
of
their
allowed
claim.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
yes.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
well,
the...
if
that's
the
amount...
the
bank
is
allowed
the...
only
the
amount
of
their
secured
claim...
their
allowed
secured
claim.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
clear
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
no,
in
fact
in
this
case,
what
was...
our
claim
was
much
more.
our
claim
was
something
for
500,000,
and
it...
and
it
was
only
allowed
for
a...
approximately
270,000
was
the
allowed
amount
of
the
claim.
mr.
calvin
dee
rider
the...
yes,
it...
yes,
it
did.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
no
further
questions.
