justice
scalia
why
do
you
have
to
prove
that
it's
a
claim
or
a
debt
for
purposes
of
chapter
13?
i
must
say,
reading
your
brief,
i
don't
see
what
the...
you
set
forth
statutes'
definitions
section.
so
what?
what
is
the
operative
provision
of
the
statute
that
uses
the
word
claim
or
debt?
justice
scalia
where...
where
is
the
section?
what
is
the
operative
section
of
the
statute?
all
you
set
forth
in
your
brief
are
the
definition
sections,
which
are,
you
know...
they're
meaningless.
why--
justice
scalia
--where
does
it
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
claim?
justice
scalia
1...
109?
justice
scalia
mr.
gilman,
why
would...
i
don't
understand
why
congress
would
do
it
that
way.
i
mean
you
say
your
client
couldn't
go
right
ahead
with
chapter
13
because
his
debts
were
too
high.
he
wouldn't
have
qualified
under
13,
so
he
goes
through
7
first
and
reduces
his
debts,
and
then
goes
through
13.
why
would
congress
want
to
do
that?
i
mean,
say,
you
know,
they
could
have
just...
just
had
a,
you
know,
a
higher
debt
limit
for
13
if
they
wanted
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that
wasn't...
we're
just
talking
about
7
and
13
right
now,
and
it
just
seems
to
me
quite
contrary
to
what
must
have
been
the
congressional
intent.
if
they...
if
they
wanted
a
higher
debt
limit
for
somebody
who
can
qualify
under
13,
they
would
have
said
so.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
whipsawing
the--
justice
scalia
--the
creditor
to
proceed
under
7
first
and
lower
your
debt,
and
they
proceed
under
13.
it's
very
strange.
justice
scalia
unless
you're
wrong
about
the
meaning
of
claim.
justice
scalia
maybe
that's
how
they
limited
it.
justice
scalia
you
say
unless
it's
unenforceable
against
the
debtor
or
property
of
the
debtor?
justice
scalia
right.
well,
this
claim
is
not
enforceable
against
the
debtor
and
property
of
the
debtor.
it's
enforceable
only
against
property
of
the
debtor.
justice
scalia
if
it
meant
either,
it
would
have
said
"or".
if
it
means
in
addition,
it
says
"and".
justice
scalia
it
has
to
be...
it--
justice
scalia
--unless
it's
unenforceable
against
both--
justice
scalia
--it
has
to
be
unenforceable
against
both
the
debtor
and
against
property.
justice
scalia
i...
may
i
say
i
had
this
problem
with
your
whole
brief.
there...
sections
are
referred
to--
--well,
i...
mr.
gilman...
i
asked
mr.
gilman
where
it
appeared
in
his
briefs,
and
i
think
he
should
answer
that
question.
please
answer
it.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
mr.
rider,
what...
is
it
the
case
that
if
this
is
a
claim
or
a
debt
under
chapter
13
it
would
necessarily
be
one
under
chapter
7
so
that
it
would
automatically
have
been
discharged?
is
that
the
position
you're
taking?
justice
scalia
the
only
thing
that
prevents
this
from...
from
being
discharged
in
chapter
7
is
the
fact
that
it's
not
a
claim?
justice
scalia
well,
which
is
correct?
i
mean
they
both
can't
be
correct.
your
answer
to
me
is
no,
then?
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
only
reason
this
survives
chapter
7
is
because
it's
not
a
claim.
it
survives
chapter
7
because
there's
a
statutory
provision
that
says
it
survives
chapter
7,
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
i
don't
under...
are
they
two
separate
arguments?
justice
scalia
he
couldn't
have
been
a
debtor
under
chapter...
under
the
other
title...
under
chapter
13
within
the
meaning
of
706(d)
only
because
his
debt
would
have
been
too
high.
justice
scalia
there
is
no
other
reason
he
couldn't
have
been
a
debtor
under
that,
right?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
mr.
rider,
what
do
you
do
about
the
provision
that
a
claim
against
a
debtor
includes
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor?
what...
what
is
your
explanation
of
that?
justice
scalia
this
is
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor,
right?
justice
scalia
and
therefore,
that
seems
to
me...
it
seems
by
that
paragraph
2
to
be
a
claim
against
the
debtor.
justice
scalia
even
though
the
claim...
the
claim
need
not
be
against
the
debtor,
but
the
claim...
the
owner...
the
property
in
question
must
be
the
property
of
the
debtor,
but
you're
saying
the...
you
must
have
a
claim
against
somebody,
even
if
not
the
debtor.
justice
scalia
give
me
an
example
of
where
there
is
a
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor
without
a
claim
against
the
debtor.
justice
scalia
up
to
the
full
amount
of
their
claim.
justice
scalia
no
matter
what
the
property...
you
know,
if
it's
sold
2
years
later
and
it's
gone
up
in
the
interim,
they
can
get
the
full
amount
of
their
claim.
that's
how
i
understand
it
works,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
of
their
claim.
justice
scalia
no
more
than
that,
but
up
to
there.
