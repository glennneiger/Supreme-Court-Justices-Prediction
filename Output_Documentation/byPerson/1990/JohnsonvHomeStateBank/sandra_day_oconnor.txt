justice
o'connor
mr.
gilman,
now
the
court
below
did
not
address
the
questions
of
feasibility
or
good
faith--
justice
o'connor
--i
take
it.
and
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
code
allows
these
sequential
filings,
i
assume
that
on
remand
the
question
of
feasibility
and
good
faith
of
the
chapter
13
filing
would
be
open?
justice
o'connor
the
so
called
cram-down
provisions--
justice
o'connor
--would
be
available.
justice
o'connor
so
the...
the
foreclosure
would
just
not
take
place
if
it
were
allowed?
justice
o'connor
do
creditors
get
to
express
a
view
under
chapter
13--
justice
o'connor
--as
to
whether
they
should
go
further?
