justice
white
he
would...
he
would...
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
if
the
forecloser
went
forward,
he
would
have
a
limited
time
to
get
it
back,
wouldn't
he?
justice
white
and
a
shorter
time
than
what
his
chapter
13
plan
called
for.
justice
white
well--
--but
i
suppose
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding,
if
its
allowed,
the
bankrupt
can
press
for
a
reduction
of
the
interest
rate
and
a
stringing
out
of
the
payment
opportunities
and
so
forth.
justice
white
did
you
say
that
the...
did
you
say
that
the
amount
of
the
debts
that
are
listed
in
a
chapter
13
petition
may
be
scaled
down
by
the
plan
or
just
strung
out?
justice
white
well,
just
forget
it.
this
is...
suppose
it's
not...
there's
no
secured
debt
at
all.
the...
it's
just
a
straight
chapter
13
proceeding.
there's
never
been
a
prior
chapter
7
proceeding,
just
an
ordinary
13
proceeding.
does...
may
the
plan
call
for
payment
of
50
percent
of
the
debt
scheduled?
justice
white
and
does
that
often
happen?
justice
white
uh-huh,
uh-huh.
justice
white
now,
what
if...
what
if...
do
you
think
the
same
can
happen
when
the
only
debt
scheduled
is
a
secured
debt?
justice
white
you
mean...
you
mean
that...
you...
he...
let's
assume
that...
let's
assume
that
the
only
thing
there
is
is
a
claim
against
property.
there's
no
personal
debt.
do
you
think
they
would
confirm
a
chapter
13
plan
that
let
him
keep
the
property
without
paying
anything?
justice
white
no,
of
course,
it
couldn't.
could
it
be
scaled
down
if
that's
the
only
claim?
justice
white
the
entire...
the
entire
amount.
justice
white
not
the
entire
amount
of
the
debt?
justice
white
well,
the
debt...
the
debt
has
actually
been
discharged
in
the...
it's
just
a
claim
against
a
property
that
hasn't
been
discharged.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
and
why
does
the
in
rem
right
pass
through?
i
think...
because
of
a
specific
provision?
justice
white
i
mean
that...
that
claim
against
the
property
is
not
discharged.
justice
white
because
of
a
provision
in
the
statute.
justice
white
because
you
have
to
claim
here
that
the
claim
against
the
property
is
a
claim...
is
a
debt.
it's
a...
for
purposes
of
13.
justice
white
because
otherwise...
otherwise
the
claim
against
the
property
would
be
discharged
in
chapter
7.
justice
white
well,
i...
i
know
but
why
does
it?
only
because
it...
the
statute
says
specifically
that,
well...
that
it
won't
be
discharged.
justice
white
at
the--
--well,
is
that
dischargeable
under
a
chapter
7?
justice
white
you
mean
the
in
personam
right
to
payment?
justice
white
i'm
sure...
i'm
sure
it
is,
but
it
isn't
discharged
in
the
chapter
7.
and
congress...
and
congress...
and
the
reason
is
that
congress
says
that
that
kind
of
a
claim
isn't
discharged.
justice
white
and
so
they
wanted
to
save
that...
they
wanted
to
save
that
kind
of
a
claim.
and
yet
you
say
that
nevertheless
they
intended
in
13
to
take
that
claim
and
string
it
out
over
10
years
maybe.
justice
white
well,
you
can
say
that...
you
can
say
like
the
court
of
appeals
did
for
example,
that
the
right
to
payment
they're
talking
about
is
right
to
payment
from
the
debtor
not
from
property.
justice
white
i
don't
know
that
i
even
mentioned
the
word
"fair".
justice
white
it
may
be.
justice
white
that's
because
of
a
specific
provision,
isn't
it?
they...
the
secured
debts.
the
security
interest
is
not
discharged.
justice
white
the
claim
against
the
property
is
not
discharged.
