justice
stevens
may
i...
may
i
just
interrupt
here
to...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
justice
souter's
suggestion.
is
it
an
interest
in
property
in
a
different
sense
than
it
was
before
the
chapter
7
discharge?
justice
stevens
the
in
rem
claim
of
the
first
mortgagee
to...
which
gives
him
right
to
foreclose,
have
the
property
sold,
and
you
get
the
property.
is
it
a
different
sort
of
interest
in
property
than
it
was
before
the
chapter
7
discharge?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
the
debtor
property
is
subject
to
the
first
mortgage
land.
justice
stevens
and...
but
who
has
possession
of
the
property?
justice
stevens
the
same
possession
he
had
before
the
discharge?
justice
stevens
and
how
did...
how
did...
i
don't
quite
understand
your
response
to
justice
souter.
how
is
the
interest
in
property
that
exists
after
the
chapter
7
discharge
any
different
from
the
interest
in
property
that
the
bank
possessed
immediately
before
the
discharge.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
it
no
longer
has
a
personal
claim,
correct?
justice
stevens
mr.
rider,
can
i
ask
you...
this
may
be
an
unrealistic
hypothetical,
but
i'm
trying
to
think
this
crazy
case
through.
supposing
a
father
or
some
friend
was
willing
to
pledge
a
piece
of
property,
a
security
for
another
person's
loans...
his
son's
loan
that
developed
the
property...
but
the
father
did
not
personally
undertake
any
personal
responsibility
for...
just
said
if
you
can't...
some...
set
it
up
in
some
fancy
way
that
the
property
would
be
security,
but
if
you
couldn't...
if
the
primary
debtor
didn't
pay
off
the
debt,
you
could
have
recourse
against
the
pledged
property.
and...
there...
nobody
could
pay.
would
the
father
in
that
situation
be
eligible
for
chapter
13
relief?
justice
stevens
well,
the...
his
right
to
payment
would
be
strictly
by
selling
the
property
and
collecting
the
proceeds.
it's
security
for...
security
for
the
son's
loan
is
what
i'm
trying
to
think
of.
sometimes
you
do...
you
know
somebody
will
put
up
security
for
someone
else's
loan.
and
i
was
just
wondering,
wouldn't
there
be
the
kind
of
debt
your
opponent
argues
for
here?
wouldn't
you
have
a
claim
against
that
property,
even
though
you
didn't
have
an
in
personam
claim
against
the
owner
of
the
property?
justice
stevens
i
guess
your
position
is
no?
justice
stevens
can
you
help
me
with
one
other
thing
that
i
just
really
don't
understand?
this
is
a
case
involving
an
undersecured
claim.
and
say
the
property
is
thought
to
have
a
value
of
$50,000
when
the
chapter
7
proceeding
is
ended.
and
then
you
go
into
the
chapter
13,
and
it's
ultimately
sold
for
more
than
that.
does
the
bank
get
the
excess
over
the
$50,000
that
it
was
thought
to
have
as
long
as
it's
under
the
amount
of
the
original
note?
justice
stevens
no,
the
property...
the...
there's
a
$100,000
note
secured
by
a
property.
at
the
time
of
the
chapter
7
proceeding
is
thought
to
have
a
value
of
only
about
$50,000.
so
you
then
extinguish
the
personal
liability,
and
the
bank
has
an
in
rem
claim
for
at
least
$50,000
against
the
property.
they
then
go
into
either
foreclosure
or
chapter
13
and
they
sell
it
for
$60,000.
they
just
underestimate
it's
actual...
who
gets
the
10?
justice
stevens
is
there
some
kind
of
a
dollar
figure
set
on
the
value
of
the
property
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding?
justice
stevens
and
that's
their...
that's
the
extent
of
the
in
rem
claim
is
that
figure,
then?
justice
stevens
so
if
it
produces
more,
we
don't
know
what
happens
to
the...
to
the--
justice
stevens
--they
cannot
recover
against
the
property
up
to
the
full
amount
of
their
claim?
justice
stevens
well,
i...
in
my
hypothetical
if
you
sell
the
property
for
60,
the
bank
gets
the
full
60.
is
that...
that's
what
justice
scalia
is
assuming.
and
that...
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stevens
but
the
original
value...
the
original
in
personam
claim
was
worth
$100,000
in
my
hypothetical,
which
has
been
discharged
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding.
and
they've
left
with
an
in
rem
claim
against
the
property.
and
is
the
value
of
that
claim
still
$100,000
if
the
property
produces
that
much
at
a
sale?
justice
stevens
in
the
original
proceeding?
justice
stevens
oh,
okay.
so
that's--
--and
would
the...
would
the
claim
be
allowed
ordinarily
in
the...
in
the
amount
of
100,000
if
that
was
the
amount
of
the
bank's
note?
justice
stevens
and
even
though
the
in
personam
claim
has
been
discharged?
justice
stevens
and
the
10
would
go
back
to
the
debtor?
justice
stevens
all
right.
but
it's
determined
not
by
the
value
of
the
property
at
the
time
of
this...
of
the
section
7
proceeding,
but
the
value
of
the
note
secured
by
the
property.
justice
stevens
well,
okay...
all
right,
the
value
of
the
mortgage.
justice
stevens
but
then
in
your
chapter
13
proceeding,
you
use
the
value
of
the
property
as
you...
as
what
you
have
to
pay
off
over
a
period
of
time.
