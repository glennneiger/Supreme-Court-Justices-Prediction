but
did
the...
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding,
did
the
general
creditors
receive
any
equity
in
the
property
that
would
be
left
after
the
foreclosure
if
there
were
some
equity?
justice
kennedy
in
that
position
would
the
bank
be
entitled
to
participate
with
the
general
creditors
to
the
extent
of
the
unsecured
balance?
justice
kennedy
was
that
sort
of
order
made?
justice
kennedy
based
on
the
appraised
value
of
the
property?
justice
kennedy
those
being
the
only
assets
available,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
and
if
under
chapter
13,
the
debtor
fails
to
meet
his
payment
schedule,
can
the
bank
at
that
time
ask
to
be
relieved...
released
from
the
automatic
stay?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
amount
of
the
bank's
claim
against
the
property,
i
take
it,
must
always
be
calculated
by
reference
to
the
antecedent
debt.
there
would
be
provisions
for
interest
i
take
it
and
attorneys'
fees,
all
of
which
can
only
be
calculated
by
reference
to
the
documents
that
created
the
original
debt.
justice
kennedy
and
so
it's
somewhat
artificial
to
say
that
the
bank
has
simply
a
claim...
or
an
interest
in
the
property,
because
that
interest
must
be
defined
by
reference
at
least
to
an
antecedent
document.
