justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
a
mortgage
lien
that
passes
through
the
chapter
7
bankruptcy
is
a
claim
subject
to
inclusion
in
the
chapter
13
reorganization
plan.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
mortgage
lien,
in
such
circumstances,
is
a
claim
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit.
