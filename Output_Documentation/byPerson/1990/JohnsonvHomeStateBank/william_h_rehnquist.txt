chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-693,
curtis
johnson
v.
home
state
bank.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
they
leave
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
gilman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
liquidation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
undersecured,
the
value
of
the
bank
security
was
not
sufficient...
would
not
be
sufficient
to
pay
off
a
face
of
its
note?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
his
purpose
in
doing
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
delay
the
foreclosure,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
wasn't...
wasn't
that
one
of
his
purposes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in...
under
this
chapter
13
cram-down
provision,
is
it
just
the
interest
of
the
creditors
that
are
considered
or
adjusted
against
one
another
or
is
the
debtor's
interest,
too,
considered
as
to
whether
the
thing
should
go
forward?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
didn't
your
client
file
under
chapter
13
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
he
first
got
rid
of
some
of
the
debt
under
chapter
7?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i--
--well,
all...
all
it
says...
all
102
says
is
that
claim
against
the
debtor
includes
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor.
i
don't
see
how
that
belies
it
right
on
its
face.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
simply
as
a
matter
of
language
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
your
position
just
automatically
establishes
itself.
you
have
to
at
least
look
to
other
parts
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
does
this
section
appear,
mr.
gilman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
not...
i
don't
mean
where
does
it
appear
in
the
statute.
where
does
it
appear
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
set
these
things
forth
verbatim,
mr.
gilman,
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
go
ahead.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
does
that
section
appear
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
here
to
argue
a
particular
section
of
the
code
that
you
don't
cite
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
that's
an
adequate
substitute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
may
proceed,
but
please
don't
ever
file
another
brief
like
that
in
this
court
that
does
not...
does
not
quote
sections
of
the
statute
on
which
you
intend
to
rely.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gilman.
mr.
rider,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
dealing
with
a
very
complicated,
intricate
statute
as
you
know.
your
opponent
says
that
in
at
least
one
other
case
where
congress
wished
to
prohibit
the
use
of
one
kind
of
chapter
proceeding
after
another,
it
has
specifically
said
so.
it
did
not
say
so
here.
it
did
not
specifically
prohibit
use
of
the
13
after
7.
what's
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx
6(d),
quoted
on
page
21
of
your
brief.
a
case
may
not
be
converted
to
a
case
under
another
chapter
this
title
unless
the
debtor
may
be
a
debtor
under
such
chapter.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
if
you're
not
allowed
to
convert
a
fortiori
you
should
not
be
able
to
start
afresh
in
that
section?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
happens
to
the
equity
of
redemption
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
he
retains
that
after
the
conclusion
of
the
chapter
7?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
asked
you
if
he
still
had
it
at
the
conclusion
of
the
chapter
7
proceeding.
are
you
telling
me
about
the
chapter
13
proceeding
or
the
chapter
7?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
does
retain
that
after
chapter
7?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
right
to
regain
title
to
the
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
i
have...
supposing
there's
a
note
for
$100,000
which
i
have
given
you.
and
i've
given
you
a
mortgage
on
my
farm,
and
i
go
into
chapter
7
and
you
file
a
claim,
did...
what
happens?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
i
think
both
justice
scalia,
justice
stevens,
and
i
are
trying
to
get
an
answer
from
you
which
seems
to
be
very
difficult
to
get
out
of
you.
can
you--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
debtor
has
a...
has
a...
has
executed
a
note
for
$100,000.
he's
given
a
mortgage
to
secure
that
note
on
a
farm.
he
goes
into
chapter
7
bankruptcy.
the
creditor
makes
a
claim
based
on
the
note
and
the
mortgage.
is
that
claim
allowed
in
the
amount
that
the...
let's
say
the
mortgage
will
not
pay
the
full
100,000.
it
will
only
pay
50,000.
is
the
claim
allowed
for
100,000,
because
that's
the
amount
of
the
note?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
amount
for
which
it
was
allowed
have
anything
to
do
with
the
value
of
the
security?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rider.
mr.
gilman,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gilman.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-693,
johnson
versus
home
state
bank
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
