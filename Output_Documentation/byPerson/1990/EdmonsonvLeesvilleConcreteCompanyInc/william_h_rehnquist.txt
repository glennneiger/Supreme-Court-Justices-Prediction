leesville
concrete
company,

mr.
doyle.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
doyle,
i
suppose
if
it's
a
constitutional
argument
you're
making,
you
would
apply
equally
to
state
courts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if
a
state
court
did
its
business
in
a
different
way
than
a
federal
court,
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
they
had
been
called
into
the
courtroom,
and
the
plaintiff
at
the
last
minute
waives
a
jury
trial
as
having
looked
at
the
veniremen,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
doyle,
is
your
identification
of
the
private
lawyer
as
a
part
of
a
government
operation
consistent
with
our
decision
in
dodson
against
polk
county?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
it's
different...
that
the
government
action
can
be
different
for
one
constitutional
provision
than
for
another?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
all
the
litigants
in
a
civil
case
such
as...
were
white?
is
there
still
a
batson
objection
to
the
striking
of
a
black
venireman
from
the
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
an
impartial
jury,
that
sounds
more
like
the
sixth
amendment
rather--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--seventh
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
just
did.
i
thought
you
just
did.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
doyle.
mr.
baker,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baker.
mr.
doyle,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
doyle.
the
case
is
submitted.
