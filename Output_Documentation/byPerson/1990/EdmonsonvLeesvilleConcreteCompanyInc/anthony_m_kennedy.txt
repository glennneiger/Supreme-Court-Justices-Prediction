the
routine
he
employed
was
that
the

were
in

then
the

were

suppose
that

the

in
terry
v.
adams,
the
white
primary
case,
we
focused
on
the
actions
of
the
members
who
were
voting
in
the
straw
poll,
did
we
not?
justice
kennedy
initially?
justice
kennedy
and
we
then
said
that
if
this
straw
poll
is,
as
a
matter
of
custom
and
practice,
simply
a
necessary
predicate
to
state
action,
that
we
were
going
to
treat
it
as
a
state
action.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
very
close
parallel
between
that
case
and
a
case
where,
as
a
matter
of
custom
and
practice
and
state
law,
and
in
this
case
federal
law,
peremptory
challenges
are
used
by
the
attorneys
who
are,
quote,
"in
a
private
capacity"
in
order
to
make
a
determination
that
has
official
consequences.

xxx.
in
this
case,
unlike
terry
v.
adams,
the
state
has
acted
in
order
to
cull
the
jurors.
the
state
has,
from
a
chronological
standpoint,
begun
its
formal
processes
even
before
the
attorney's
peremptory
challenge
is
exercised.
so
this
in
a
way
is
even
an
easier
case
than
terry
v.
adams,
isn't
it?

it's

justice

yes,
but
that

justice

well,
but
the
question
is
whether

not
that

89-7743.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united

court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
concerns
preemptory
challenges
to
perspective
jurors
in
civil
cases.
petitioner,
edmondson,
was
a
construction
worker.
he
sued
leesville
concrete

for
injuries
he
suffered
in
a
job-site
accident.
during
voir
dire
in
the
united

district
court,
the
company
used
two
of
its
three
preemptory
challenges
to
remove

sighting
our
decision
in
batson
versus
kentucky,
edmondson,
who
was
himself
black,
asked
the
district
court
to
require
leesville
to
articulate
a
race
neutral
explanation
for
its
preemptory
strikes
of
these
black
jurors.
the
court
denied
the
request
holding
that
batson,
which
is
a
criminal
case,
does
not
apply
in
civil
proceedings.
the
jury
is
finally
chosen
and
had
11
white
persons
and
1
black
person.
it
found
leesville
liable
but
it
awarded
edmondson
only
a
fraction
of
the
damages
he
had
suffered
because
it
found
that
edmondson's
own
negligence
had
contributed
to
the
accident.
a
divided
in
bank
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
judgment
holding
that
a
private
litigant
in
a
civil
case
may
exercise
preemptory
challenges
without
accountability
for
alleged
racial
classifications.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
earlier
this
term
in
powers
versus
ohio,
we
reaffirmed
our
holding
in
batson
versus
kentucky
that
a
prosecutor's
exclusion
of
perspective
jurors
on
the
basis
of
race
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
although
powers
and
batson
both
involved
racial
discrimination
in
the
context
of
criminal
trials,
discrimination
in
the
context
of
civil
proceedings
is
no
less
offensive
to
the
dignity
of
person
and
the
integrity
of
the
courts.
should
a
government
lawyer
in
a
civil
action
exclude
jurors
in
the
basis
of
race,
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
exclusion
would
violate
equal
protection
principles.
the
question
before
us
here
is
whether
the
exercise
of
preemptory
challenge
by
a
private
litigant
and
a
private
lawyer
can
be
considered
state
action
for
the
purposes
of
applying
the
equal
protection
clause
we
hold
that
it
is
state
action.
most
actions
by
private
litigants
and
including
the
initial
decision
whether
to
sue
it
all
are
without
the
requisite
governmental
character
to
be
deemed
state
action.
that
cannot
be
said
of
preemptory
challenges.
when
private
litigants
participate
in
the
selection
of
jurors,
they
serve
an
important
function
within
the
government
and
act
with
its
substantial
assistance.
without
the
overt
significant
participation
of
the
government,
the
preemptory
challenge
system
as
well
as
the
jury
trial
system
of
which
it
is
a
part
simply
could
not
exist.
preemptory
challenges
are
authorized
by
statute
of
common
law
and
have
no
purpose
other
than
to
facilitate
the
trial
of
the
cause.
the
jurors
were
excluded
to
act
solely
in
the
government's
direction,
which
summons
potential
jurors
from
their
jurors
from
their
employment
or
other
pursuits,
assigns
them
to
venire
panels,
and
pays
them
for
their
services.
the
court
oversees
why
they
improvise
litigants
with
information
regarding
prospective
jurors
and
that
it
is
the
court
that
must
inform
a
prospective
juror
that
he
or
she
has
been
excused
from
the
service.
the
preemptory
challenge
also
has
used
to
perform
a
function
that
is
governmental
in
nature,
and
that
function
is
the
selection
of
a
jury.
a
jury
is
a
quintessential
government
body.
we
have
been
consistent
in
holding
that
private
parties
may
become
state
actors
when
they
are
entrusted
with
making
governmental
decisions.
finally,
we
note
that
the
injury
caused
by
discrimination
is
made
more
severe
because
the
government
permits
it
to
occur
within
the
courthouse
itself.
few
places
provide
a
more
real
expression
of
the
constitution
authority
of
the
government
than
a
courtroom,
where
the
law
itself
unfolds,
permit
racial
exclusion
in
this
official
form
compounds
the
racial
insult
inherent
in
judging
a
citizen
by
the
color
of
his
or
her
skin.
permitting
litigants
to
use
preemptory
challenges
may
contribute
to
the
wide
acceptance
of
the
jury
system
and
of
its
verdicts.
but
its
race
stereotypes
are
the
price
for
the
preemptory
challenge
system
that
price
is
too
high
to
meet
the
standard
of
the
constitution.
other
means
exists
for
litigants
to
satisfy
themselves
of
an
impartial
jury
without
using
skin
color
as
a
test.
if
our
society
is
to
continue
to
progress
as
a
multiracial
democracy,
it
must
recognize
that
the
automatic
invocation
of
racial
stereotypes
retires
that
progress
and
causes
continued
harm.
whether
the
race
generality
employed
by
the
litigants
to
challenge
a
potential
juror
to
rise
from
open
hostility
or
from
some
hidden
and
inarticulated
fear,
neither
motive
entitles
the
litigant
to
cause
injury
to
the
excused
juror.
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
reversed.

o'connor

filed
