justice
stevens
before
you
say
that,
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question?
justice
stevens
you've
devoted
your
entire
argument
to
state
action.
justice
stevens
is
state
action
essential
in
your
view
to
prevailing
on
either
the
statutory
ground
or
the
supervisory
power
ground?
justice
stevens
it
isn't.
justice
stevens
but
you
think
we
should
address
the
constitutional
ground
before
we
address
the
other
two,
is
that--
justice
stevens
--you
didn't
get
time
to
get
to
the
first
argument...
your
first
two
arguments?
justice
stevens
may
ask
on
the
question
of
the
judge's
participation,
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
as
i
understand
it,
makes
the
argument
that
the
judge
does
have
an
input
into
the
preemptive
challenge
process,
because
he
can
decide
which
side
challenges
first,
whether
there
shall
be
a
writing
done
simultaneously.
he
has
control
over
the
size
of
the
panel
from
which
they're
made.
so
he
does
have
some
impact
on
the
way
in
which
the
peremptory
challenge
is
exercised.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
justice
stevens
he
can
influence...
of
course,
he
can
influence
that
choice
in
some
ways
by
the
way
he
rules
on
challenges
for
cause.
if
he
takes
a
very
strict
view,
he
may
require
the
parties
to
use
more
peremptories
and
that
sort
of
thing.
i
mean,
he
does
have
a
part
in
that
decision-making
process,
even
though
you're
absolutely
right,
he
does
not
make
the
decision.
justice
stevens
what
about
our
case
involving
the
probate
court?
do
you
remember--
justice
stevens
--yes.
justice
stevens
mr.
baker,
you've
mentioned
that
statute.
what
about
the
earlier
statute,
though,
that
says
in
so
many
words,
no
citizen
shall
be
excluded
from
service
on
a
jury
on
account
of
race?
if
it
were
not
for
the
peremptory
challenge
statute,
which
was
enacted
a
few
years
later,
would
you
agree
that
covered
this
case?
justice
stevens
18...
section
1862,
yes.
justice
stevens
on
account
of
race.
justice
stevens
now,
why
doesn't
that
apply?
justice
stevens
i'm
not...
i
must
say
i'm
not
quite
clear
i
understand
what
the
answer
is
to
the...
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
the
state.
that's
the
point
of
this.
that's
the
reason
i
refer
to
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
it
shall...
it
doesn't
say,
shall
be
excluded
by
the
state.
it
says,
no
citizen
shall
be
excluded,
i
interpolate,
by
anyone
from
service
as
a
grand
or
petit
juror
on
account
of
race.
justice
stevens
you
mean
if
you're
stricken
in
the
peremptory,
you're
not
excluded
from
service?
justice
stevens
i
see.
just
service
in
that
case.
what
it
means
is
you'll
not
be
excluded...
totally
excluded
from
all
service
as
a
jury...
juror.
