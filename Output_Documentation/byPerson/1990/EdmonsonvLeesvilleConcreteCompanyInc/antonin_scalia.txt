justice
scalia
i
also
assume
it
wouldn't...
would
it
just
apply
to
racial
discrimination?
wouldn't
it
apply
to
discrimination
on
any
other
grounds?
justice
scalia
um-hum,
um-hum.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
decision
not
to
have
a
jury
at
all?
i
mean,
you
have
an
option
to
have
a
jury...
you
waive
your
right
to
a
jury
trial.
is
that
the
government...
is
that
the
government
depriving
the
other
side
of
a
jury
in
terms--
justice
scalia
--why...
how
do
you
shift
back
and
forth?
i
mean,
if
the
lawyer
is
in
effect
the
government
whenever...
whenever
he's
making
a
decision
involving
the
jury,
it
seems
to
me
he's
always
the
government
when
he's
making
that
decision.
justice
scalia
so
he
decides
i
want
my
client
tried
by
a
judge
instead
of
by
a
jury?
justice
scalia
he's
selecting
the
official.
justice
scalia
he's
acting
as
a...
as
the
government
then.
that's
a
government
decision?
justice
scalia
well,
but
he
can
pick
either
judge
or
jury.
justice
scalia
and
you
say
that's
the
government...
he's
making
that
as
a
governmental
decision
then?
justice
scalia
so
it
would
be
okay
for
him
to
say,
well,
in
this
district
i
think
the
jury
is
likely
to
be
black
and
i
know
we
have
a
white
judge
on
the
docket,
and
therefore,
i'll
waive
the
jury
trial.
that's
okay,
because
that's
not
a
governmental
decision.
justice
scalia
so
it's
okay?
justice
scalia
i
think
it
excludes
every
one
of
them...
every
one
of
the
jurors...
every
one
of
them.
justice
scalia
mr.
doyle,
it
would
also...
it
would
also
follow,
would
it
not,
if
we
accept
your
equal
protection
argument
that
even
the
peremptory
challenges
of
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
let's
assume
you're
being
prosecuted
for
a
crime
that
has
allegedly
a
racial
motivation
and
as
the
defendant
you
seek
to
strike
people
of
the...
what
you
consider
the
antagonistic
race
from
the
jury.
that
would
be
no
good
either
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
scalia
so
that
even
if,
let's
say,
a
black
defendant
thinks
that
he's...
whether
he
thinks
it
rightly
or
wrongly...
he's
not
going
to
get
a
fair
shake
from
white
jurors
in
a
particular
county,
he
can't
strike
them
just
because
they're
white?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
say
about
excluding
members
of
the
defendant's
race
or
the
plaintiff's
race
is
the
same
for
a
lot
of
other
things.
i
mean,
he
could
come
to
the
conclusion...
let's
assume
he's
a...
the
plaintiff
is
a
postman
and
the
defendant
strikes
all
postment
from
the
venire,
he's
going...
i
guess
he
could
make
the
same
statement.
any
system
that
discriminates
against
postmen
is
going
to
discriminate
against
me,
cause
i'm
a
postman.
justice
scalia
or
alsost
anything
else,
right?
justice
scalia
by
the
equal
protection
clause,
certainly.
justice
scalia
can
i
treat
postmen
differently
for
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
scalia
postmen
don't
get
any...
postmen
pay
higher
taxes?
justice
scalia
but
there's
nothing
any
more
invidious
about
striking
a
member
of
my
race
on
the
theory
that
he's
more
likely
to
vote
for
me,
which
is
probably
the
basis
on
which
it's
done
if
that
was
the
motive,
than
there
is
striking
somebody
from
my
occupation--
justice
scalia
--a
professor
or
a
judge
or
anything
else.
what...
why
would
anyone
in
his
right
mind
think
that's
invidious?
justice
scalia
mr.
baker,
i
suppose
the
judge
tells
witnesses
to
step
down,
too.
what
if
a
counsel
decides
that
a
witness
he's
put
on
is
antagonizing
the
jury
because
he
sees
it's
a
jury
that
seems
to
have
racial
biases.
so,
in
order
to
increase
his
chances
of
winning
the
case,
he
tells
the
witness,
after
a
first
few
questions,
you
may
step
down.
and
i
suppose
the
judge
tells
the
witness
down.
that
would
be
quite
analogous
to
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
the
independent
decision
taken
by
a
private
individual
on
racial
grounds
but
the
judge
enforcing
it
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
justice
scalia
no,
no
more
than
it
is
in
a
peremptory
strike.
he
just
says,
you
know,
i'm
done
with
this
witness.
justice
scalia
even
though
the
private
party
is...
the
reason
the
private
party
is
getting
this
witness
off
the
stand
is
racial?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it
would
be
different
if
he
said,
your
honor...
or
he
said
to
the
witness,
i
think
you're
antagonizing
this
all-white
jury
and
i'd
rather
not
have
you
go
on?
i'm
done.
justice
scalia
then
could
the
judge...
the
judge
would
have
to
say,
no,
you
shall
continue
to
cross
examine
or--
justice
scalia
--that's
why
i'm
not
sure
the
distinction
you
draw
between
whether
the
judge
knows
about
the
racial
reason
or
not
is
very
satisfying
one.
i
don't
really
think
it
makes
too
much
difference
whether
he
knows
or
doesn't
know.
the
judge
is
either...
the
lawyer
who
sets
the
thing
in
motion
is
either
a
state
actor
or
he's
not.
i
don't
see
how
the
judge's
knowledge
of
his
racial
motivation
can
make
a
difference.
justice
scalia
the
effective
actor
is
either
the
lawyer
or
the
judge.
if
it's
the
judge,
then
the
game's
over,
whether
or
not
the
judge
knows
of
the
racial
motivation.
justice
scalia
well,
you'd
draw
a
distinction
if...
let's
assume
you're
in
a
state
that
has
15
peremptories
and
every
single
peremptory
is
used
by
the
plaintiff
to
strike
a
black
juror.
now,
you
need
a
pretty
stupid
judge
not
to
figure
out
what's
going
on.
in
that
situation
then,
you
think
the
plaintiff
here
would
be
right?
justice
scalia
and
indeed
if
you
did
apply
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
strike
rich
people
from
the
jury
or...
which
certainly
happens
quite
frequently,
i
would
think.
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
the
judge
assisting
him
in
that
any
more
than
when
he...
the
judge
tells
a
witness
to
step
down?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--but
that
doesn't
say
why
the
judge
is
assisting
him
any
more
than
in
the
other
case.
the
degree
of
assistance
is
just
the
same.
you
may
say
it's
a
different--
