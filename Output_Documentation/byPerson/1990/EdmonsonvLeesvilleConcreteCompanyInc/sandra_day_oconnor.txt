justice
o'connor
mr.
doyle,
under
your
view,
in
a
private,
civil
action
on
behalf
of,
let's
say,
a
plaintiff
who
was
black,
would
the
plaintiff's
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
against
white
perspective
jurors
be
similarly
suspect
and
open
to
challenge
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
o'connor
but
on
your
argument
then,
your
client's
own
peremptory
challenges
would
be
open
to
the
same
attack?
