mr.
james
e.
doyle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
batson
v.
kentucky
applies
in
civil
cases
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
more
specifically,
the
question
before
you
today
is
whether,
in
a
case
in
which
a
black
man
is
a
litigant,
counsel
for
his
opponent
can
use
his
statutorily
granted
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
blacks
from
the
jury
panel
without
any
question
or
without
any
interference
from
the
court.
we
contend
that
he
cannot,
and
we
suggest
three
reasons
why
such
a
practice
is
inconsistent
with
the
dictates
of
this
court.
one
is
constitutional
based
upon
an
equal
protection
analysis.
the
other
two
are
nonconstitutional
issues,
one
statutory
and
one
based
upon
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
at
the
outset,
this
court
should
note
the
conflict
among
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
which
now
exists.
as
recently
as
last
month,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
a
case
called
dunham
v.
frank's
nursery
and
crafts,
which
is
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
ruled
in
a
case
on
all
fours
with
the
case
before
you
today
that
batson
does
apply
in
civil
cases.
prior
to
that
ruling,
the
eleventh
circuit
had
reached
the
same
result
in
a
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
the
eighth
circuit
has
ruled
that
with
respect
to
a
governmental
litigant
the
batson
rule
does
apply
and
does
extend
to
civil
cases.
that
case
now
awaits
action
by
this
court
on
a
petition.
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiff
filed
suit
as
a
result
of
injuries
that
he
sustained
while
he
was
working
on
a
united
states
army
base.
the
case
was
tried
to
a
jury
selected
from
a
venire
compiled
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
the
panel
of
12
was
ultimately
chosen
from
18
who
were
selected
to
sit
in
the
box.
of
that
number...
of
the
18,
that
is...
3
were
members
of
the
black
race.
voir
dire
was
conducted
by
the
trial
judge,
and
at
its
conclusion,
the
judge
and
counsel
retired
to
the
judge's
chambers
to
exercise
their
peremptory
challenges.
at
that
point,
counsel
for
the
respondent
exercised
two
of
his
three
challenges
against
black
jurors.
and--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that
was
the
practice
of
this
particular
federal
district
judge,
justice
kennedy.
he...
and
they
are
done
in
writing.
you
will
be
given
a
sheet
of
paper
and
on
that
sheet
of
paper
you
will
list
by
name
the
jurors
that
you
are
challenging
and
submit
that
to
the
court,
who
will
then
read
the
challenges
on
the
record
in
chambers.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
challenges...
there
was
one
challenge
for
cause
in
this
case,
and
it
was
done
in
open
court.
that
would
be
the
routine
that
this
judge
did
employ.
challenges
for
cause--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--yes.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
the
peremptory
challenges
were
made
known
in
chambers.
the
effect
of
the
challenges,
that
is,
the
excuse
to
the
jury,
was
done
in
open
court
after
the
court
reconvened.
at
the
point
at
which
the
challenges
were
exercised
by
the
respondent,
i
did
object
and
cited
the
court
to
batson
v.
kentucky
and
argued
that
in
that
particular
case,
since
there
was
a
black
litigant
and
since
counsel
for
the
respondent
had
exercise
two
of
his
statutorily
granted
strikes
against
members
of
the
black
race,
that
the
equal
protection
basis
of
batson
was
implicated.
the
judge
overruled
my
objection,
refused
to
allow...
or
refused
to
require,
rather,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
to
voice
a
racially
neutral
reason
for
the
objections
or
for
the
challenges
that
he
had
made
and
the
case
went
back
into
the
courtroom.
at
that
stage,
the
judge
then
called
the
jury
back
in
the
box,
announced
which
jurors
were
being
excused.
those
jurors
left
the
courtroom.
the
objection
was
once
again
raised
to
the
court
in
open
court,
outside
the
jury's
presence.
it
was
once
again
overruled,
and
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
we
believe
that
batson
made
clear...
this
court's
opinion
in
batson
made
clear
that
the
constitution
prohibits
all
forms
of
purposeful
racial
discrimination
in
jury
selection.
the
first
panel,
hearing
this
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
agreed
and
ruled
2
to
1
for
that
proposition,
extending
batson
to
this
particular
civil
case.
but
on
en
banc
rehearing,
that
decision
was
reversed
and
the
court
ruled
that
equal
protection
was
not
implicated
because
of
the
absence
of
state
action.
we
contend
that
the
fundamental
error
that
the
trial
court
made
and
the
fundamental
error
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
was
in
not
recognizing
that
batson
was...
should
be
extended
to
civil
cases,
and
in
refusing
to
require
the
judge
to
conduct
the
hearing
which
batson
would
mandate.
the
fact
that
that
hearing
was
not
conducted
in
this
case
requires
a
reversal
and
a
remand
so
that
the
hearing
can
be
conducted
to
determine
whether
the
challenges
were
racially
exercised
or
exercised
for
some
other
reason.
the
first
argument
that
we
will
address
the
court's
attention
to
is
the
constitutional
argument.
any
trial
in
a
federal
courtroom
is
a
public
function,
whether
it's
civil
or
criminal.
it
takes
place
on
government
property,
presided
over
by
a
federal
officer
in
the
case
of
jury
trials
by
using
citizens
who
are
pulled
compulsory...
with
the
compulsory
process
of
the
federal
courts
in
to
the
courtroom,
who
are
sworn
as
officers
of
the
court,
for
that
purpose
to
render
a
decision
in
the
dispute
among
the
parties.
those
jurors
are
selected
in
accordance
with
federal
statute.
they
are
summoned
by
having
their
names
first
placed
on
a
jury
wheel,
which
is
made
up
by
federal
officials.
they
are
paid
with
government
funds.
and
they're
protected
by
the
same
statute
from
force
and
intimidation
which
applies
to
the
federal
judge
who
sits
on
the
case.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
it
is.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
state
court
would
be
bound
by
the
same
equal
protection
considerations.
if
batson
applies
in
state
courts,
it
would
apply
the
same
way
that
it
does
not
in
state
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
we
take
the
position,
justice
scalia,
that
batson
should
be
adopted
as
batson
now
exists.
if
batson
is
later
extended
to
groups
other
than
race,
then
it
would
be
extended
likewise
into
the
civil
area.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
first
question
we
submit
that
should
be
addressed
is
whether
those
who
participate
in
an
inherently
governmental
function,
that
is,
selecting
a
jury
that
is
going
to
try
and
hear
a
case
in
a
federal
courtroom,
engage
in
governmental
action
during
this
process.
we
believe
clearly
that
they
do.
the
only
distinction
that
can
be
drawn
between
persons
who
compile
and
select
the
names
for
the
jury
wheel
and
the
lawyer
who
ultimately
makes
the
decision
of
who
he's
going
to
sit
on
the
jury
by
the
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
is
who
pays
them
their
salary.
the
private
lawyer
is
paid
by
his
client;
the
governmental
official
is
paid
by
the
government.
but
their
decisions
have
impact
on
who
ultimately
sits
on
the
jury
in
the
same
fashion.
we
believe
that
the
participation
of
a
private
lawyer,
utilizing
the
authority
granted
to
him
by
federal
statute,
is
just
as
much
a
public
function
as
any
other
such
authority
granted
to
a
private
individual
to
intervene
in
governmental
processes.
we
believe
it's
not
materially
different
from
a
decision,
if
one
were
given
to
a
private
person,
from
hiring
a
bailiff
or
a
clerk
who
would
work
on
the
same
court's
staff.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
that's
a
joint
decision
made
by
two
private
parties.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
decision
that
he
makes
when
he
selects
a
jury
is
different
from
the
decision
that
he
makes
in
other
aspects
of
the
trial.
and
it's
different
for
this
reason.
it's
inherently
governmental,
because
it
involves
the
selection
of
governmental
officials.
jurors
are,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
once
they're
seated
to
try
a
case,
governmental
officials.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
government
decision
in
the
same
way,
because
he
can't
pick
the
judge.
the
judge
is
there.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct.
he
can
make
that
decision,
but
i
see
it--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--not
when
he
picks
the
judge...
not
when
he
decides
not
to
have
a
jury.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
if
he
makes
that
decision,
he
not
discriminating
against
black
jurors--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--it's
okay,
because
it's
not...
it
doesn't
address
the
same
point
that's
addressed
in
batson.
it
doesn't
have
the
same
dynamics.
it
doesn't
have
the
same
parties
who
are
harmed.
it
doesn't
have
the
exclusion
of
jurors,
which
is
one
of
the
focuses
of
batson,
and
also
this
court
in
holland
v.
illinois.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
but
if
there's
no
jury
trial,
they
haven't
yet
been
called.
they
haven't
been
called
into
the
courtroom
and
said,
well,
we
see
who
you
are.
we
see
that
you're
all
black,
so
we're
going
to
waive
the
jury
and
we're
going
to
proceed
without
you.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
still
don't
think
at
that
point
it
would
be
the
same
as
in
batson,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
at
that
point,
the
stigma
which
applies
to
the
individual
jurors
of
the
minority
race
is
not
yet
attached.
the
jury
in
its
entirety
is
being
waived
at
that
point.
the
jury
in
its
entirety
is
being
discharged.
that
doesn't
connote
the
same
racial
distinction
in
the
analysis
which
would
be
made
under
a
batson
rule.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
that
would
have
the
same
effect
constitutionally,
because
it
would
still
be
the
selection
of
a
governmental
official.
so
following
that
analysis,
i
would
have
to
agree
that
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
analysis
of
the
constitution...
if
it
were
made
for
solely
that
reason.
i
don't
want
to
get
beyond
the
narrow
focus
of
this
case.
i'm
not
suggesting,
justice
kennedy,
that
there
is
never
a
circumstance
where
a
white
litigant
could
not
successfully
challenge
a
black
juror.
the
only
reason
he
can't
challenge
him,
in
this
case
we
offer
for
your
consideration,
is
for
a
racial
reason.
so
the
same
analysis
would
apply
equally
to
the
judge
it
seems
to
me.
if
that
right
is
given
to
the
lawyer
in
the
california
courts,
then
it
would
be
given
in
no
different
fashion
than
the
passing
over
to
the
litigant...
to
the
lawyers
representing
the
litigants,
the
right
to
pick
the
governmental
officials
in
a
jury
trial.
i
want
to
address,
if
i
might
just
a
moment,
the
questions
which
are
presented
by
two
cases
this
court
has
decided
on
the
issue
of
state
action,
lugar
v.
edmonson
oil
and
tulsa
professional
collection
services
v.
pope.
those
cases
set
forth
a
two-prong
test
to
determine
whether
state
action
exists.
judge
rubin,
in
analyzing
it
for
the
original
panel
opinion,
believed
that
that
test
was
met.
the
en
banc
majority's
decision
that
it...
that
batson
would
not
be
extended...
turned
on
their
analysis
that
the
test
was
not
met.
all
parties
concede,
however,
that
the
first
prong
is
clearly
here,
because
the
exercise
that
the
peremptory
challenge
is
an
exercise
made
pursuant
to
a
governmental
grant
of
authority.
it's
the
second
part
of
the
test
which
needs
to
be
addressed
by
this
court
in
this
analysis
and
was
addressed
below.
that
is
whether
the
otherwise
private
actor,
the
lawyer
involved,
acted
with
the
significant
assistance
of
public
officers
and
officials.
lugar
particularly
speaks
of
joint
participation
of
private
parties
and
governmental
officials
in
an
equal
protection,
due
process
context.
here
the
private
counsel
was
performing
his
inherently
governmental
function,
selecting
the
jury,
together
with
the
marshal,
the
jury
officer
who
selected
the
jury
wheel,
the
judge,
and
the
bailiff.
picking
a
jury
then
is
a
series...
is
not
a
series
of
isolated
procedures,
but
it's
a
continuum,
and
any
stage
in
the
process
can
lead
to
a
result
not
allowed
by
law.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
it's
a
different
case
from
dodson,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
the
polk
county
v.
dodson
case,
the
only
issue
reached
was
whether
the
public
defender
acted
under
color
of
state
law
in
section
1983.
and
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
lugar
case,
the
issues
of
equal
protection
were
never
addressed
in
polk
county.
and
it
did
not
foreclose
the
possibility
that
that--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--no,
sir.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the...
that
whether
governmental
action
is
present
is
different
depending
upon
what
the
person
who
is
asserted
to
be
a
state
actor
is
doing.
i
think
that
some
of
the
functions
that
the
public
defender
could
have
performed
in
dodson
would
be
inherently
governmental
and
some
not.
so
i
think
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
picking
the
jury
if
it...
if
you
accept
as
a
hypothetical
premise
that
the
batson
equal
protection
analysis
would
apply
to
a
public
defender
in
a
defense
context,
and
i'm
not
reaching
that
point.
but
if
you
do
accept
that,
then
certainly,
if
that
public
defender
engaged
in
a
discriminatory
jury
strike,
she
would
have
been
engaging
in
state
action.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
clearly
it
would
under
the
equal
protection
clause
if
that
is
the
limited
focus
of
the
analysis.
if
another
provision...
the
equal
protection
analysis
is
the
broadest
sweep
of
the
argument
that
i'm
making,
justice
o'connor.
to
jump
ahead
just
a
moment,
if,
for
example,
the
court
were
to
determine--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--certainly,
if
they
met--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--certainly,
they
would
have
been,
if
they
met
the
same
batson
analysis.
if
they
met
the
same
batson
burdens
of
proof,
they
would
have
been
open
to
challenge
and
i
would
have
been
required
to
voice
a
racially
neutral
reason
for
striking
the
white
jurors.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
if
the
sole
focus
of
the
argument
is
equal
protection,
yes,
that's
true.
but
the
criminal
defendant
may
have
other
avenues
available
to
him,
justice
scalia,
with
which
i
am
not
particularly
familiar
which
might
arise
under
other
constitutional
provisions.
but
if
the
analysis
is
solely
limited
to
equal
protection,
it
would
certainly
be
correct.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
think
that's
clearly
the
result
under
an
equal
protection
analysis,
and
it's
no
different
from
that
which
was
reached
by
the...
by
the
new
york
courts
in
people
v.
kern,
a
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
howard
beach
case.
it's
the
reverse.
it
was
a
white
defendant
striking
black
jurors,
but
it
was
the
same
result.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
batson's
not
reached
that
issue.
it
would
depend
on
whether
batson
goes
that
far
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
think
there
are
certainly
every...
there
is
certainly
every
valid
reason
to
suspect
that
at
least
in
particular
kinds
of
cases
the
exercise
of
peremptory
strikes
on
gender-based
discrimination
would
be
just
as
invidious
as
the
exercise
of
strikes
based
on
race
discrimination,
particularly...
let's
take,
for
example,
the
sexual
harassment
suit.
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
of
individuals
to
allow
a
woman
to
go
to
trial
in
a
sexual
harassment
suit,
but
yet
allow
her
opponent
to
be
able
to
strike
every
woman
from
the
jury
if
that
were
available.
so,
i
would
suspect
that
it
would,
although
this
court's
never
reached
that
point.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
not
yet.
at
least
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be.
i
don't
think
that
it's
been
extended
that
far.
in
an
equal
protection
context
i
suppose
the
question
would
always
arise,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
the
inherent
right
to
a
jury
selected
using
race-blind
criteria,
overrides
other
considerations
such
as
standing.
but
i
think
in
such
a
circumstance
the
white
defendant
would
certainly
have
to
show
some
injury
in
fact
which
resulted
to
him.
continue
with
the
analysis
of
lugar
v.
edmonson,
i
should
point
out
that
one
part
of
it
i
think
is
particularly
appropriate
here.
the
analysis
which
was
made
of
what
the
underlying
court
of
appeal
had
done
there
contained
this
phrase
which
this
court
believed
was
a
more
restrictive
test.
a
private
party
acts
under
color
of
state
law
when
there
is
a
surrender
of
judicial
power
to
the
private
litigant
in
such
a
way
that
the
independence
of
the
enforcing
officer
has
been
compromised
to
a
significant
degree.
now,
that
more
restrictive
view
was
not
adopted
by
the
court
in
lugar,
but
it's
particularly
appropriate
to
look
at
here
because
if
the
judge
is
the
enforcing
officer
of
the
right,
it's
hard
to
imagine
more
restrictions
that
could
be
placed
on
him
than
to
say,
as
the
respondent
in
the
en
banc
majority
did,
that
he
has
no
discretion,
that
he
can
do
nothing
else
but
excuse
the
juror.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white.
do
you
mean
my
client
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff?
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
has
cited
in
batson
v.
kentucky
and
meets
the
test
first
met
under
batson.
he's
a
black
litigant;
black
jurors
were
stricken.
along
the
way
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
batson
does
include
within
the
zone
of
protection,
the
black
jurors.
if
you're
asking
me
whether
i
specifically
made
that
objection,
no
i
did
not.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
my
client's.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
my
client's
equal
protection
rights
are
at
issue
in
this
case?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
because
peremptory
strikes
were
used
to
challenge
and
remove
from
the
jury
members
of
his
race--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--and
effectively
in
this--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
effectively
in
this
case...
well,
they
denied
him
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
in
the
same
fashion--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that
the
batson
defendant
was
denied.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
see
your
point.
i
think
the
injury
in
fact
here,
though,
is
that
mr.
edmonson,
a
black
plaintiff...
a
black
litigant,
was
deprived
of
a
chance
to
have
a
jury
that
contained
black
members
effectively.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
ever
since--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
i
think
that
no--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
think
the
notion
is,
justice
white,
the
same
as
announced
in
peters
v.
kiff
and
in
strauder.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
the
notion
is
very
specifically
that
a
jury
selected
using
racially
discriminatory
criteria
is
not
an
impartial
jury
or
at
least
the
inferences
are
that
it
is
not
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
that--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that's
right.
that
would
not
have
that...
have
that
cache
i
suppose.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
seventh...
or
seventh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
we're
not
making
that
argument.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
but
i
think--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
i
believe
that
the
cases,
particularly
peters
v.
kiff
and
justice
marshall's
opinion,
are
directed
towards
the
method
of
selection
of
the
jury.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir,
it
was.
if
i
could
move
on
just
briefly
to
my
other
two?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
they
both
are
at
issue.
i
didn't
mean
to
give
you--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--but
including
my
client.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
right
to
have
a
jury
selected
using
race-blind
criteria.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
because--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
converse
of
that
is
correct.
as
this
court
said
in
one
occasion,
a
negro
who
confronts
a
jury,
upon
which
no
negro
is
allowed
to
sit,
might
very
well
conclude
that
the
system
which
discriminates
against
negroes
would
discriminate
against
him.
and
i
think
that's
the
equal
protection
right...
the
right
of
fairness,
the
right
of
evenhandedness,
if
you
will.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
oh,
he
is.
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
to
you
that
i
didn't
think
he
was.
i
think
that
is
a
part
of
batson.
what
i
suggested
to
you
is
that
i
did
not
specifically
invoke
that
necessarily
at
the
trial
level,
although
i
did
quote
the
portion
of
batson
which
speaks
about
injury
to
the
community
at
large
and
to
the
system
of
justice.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
because
this
court
has
never
extended
the
cross-section
requirement
to
the
petit
jury,
and
we
have
not
pursued
that
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
he
might,
but
not
every
kind
of
discrimination,
justice
scalia,
is
reachable
by
the
dictates
of
the
constitution.
racial
discrimination--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
in
the
jury
selection
context,
in
the
narrow
confines
of
this
case,
the
batson--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
i--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
cannot
concede,
justice
scalia,
that
any
decision
based
on
the
line
of
cases
which
i
have
cited
to
you
here
would
involve
anyone
other
than
a
discrete
and
insular
minority,
the
quotation
from
the
old
civil
case.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
a
discrimination
which
is
going
to
be
characterized
as
invidious.
i'm
not
sure
that
a
postman
or
other
employment-based
discrimination
might
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
thiel
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
that,
because
in
thiel
no
constitutional
provision
was
ever
implicated.
the
supervisory
authority
of
the
court
was
used
to
invalidate
the
jury
selection
process.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
in
this
case--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
i
can
only
answer
and
respond,
justice
scalia,
by
saying
i
think
race
is
treated
differently,
and
i
think
these
cases
all
spell
it
out.
racial
discrimination
is
what
should
be
prohibited
and
eradicated
from
the
jury
selection
process.
the
same
has
not
been
said
about
postmen
or
other
occupational
areas.
if
i
might
in
closing
just
say
one
final
thing
in
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
not
just
about
my
client,
thaddeus
edmonson,
or
about
mr.
baker's--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
as
a
matter
of
fact,
specifically--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--no,
sir.
i
didn't
have
time
to
get
to
it,
justice
stevens,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
but
i
do
believe
that
this
court
should
follow
its
prudential
practice.
the
narrowest
decision
the
court
could
make
would
be
one
based
on
the
statutory
analysis,
including
section...
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
which
is
solely
based
on
race.
the
supervisory
authority
would
also
be
very
narrowly
exercised
because
it
would
only
apply
to
the
federal
courts,
and
the
broadest
would
be
the
equal
protection
balances.
and
in
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
was
saying,
this
case
is
not
just
about
the
right
of
my
client,
mr.
edmonson,
or
about
mr.
baker's
leesville
concrete
company.
this
appeal
also
concerns
two
men
who
are
not
represented
by
counsel
and
are
not
here
today,
willie
combs
and
wilton
simmons.
they
are
the
two
black
jurors
who
were
excused
from
jury
service
by
judge
vera.
we
don't
know
much
about
mr.
combs
and
mr.
simmons.
we
don't
know
much
about
them
because
respondent's
trial
counsel
saw
no
need
to
ask
any
questions
before
he
challenged
them
as
jurors.
we
don't
know
where
combs
and
simmons
were
born.
we
don't
know
where
they
were
educated.
we
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
been
fair.
we
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
been
partial.
but
we
can
be
sure
that
july
27th,
1987,
the
day
that
jury
selection
took
place,
was
a
special
one
in
their
lives.
for
many
people
in
this
room,
jury
selection
would
be
an
inconvenience.
but
for
a
black
man
or
woman
in
louisiana
the
right
to
serve
as
a
juror
is
as
new
and
a...
as
great
an
honor
as
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
combs'
parents
and
his
grandparents
could
not
have
served
on
the
jury
in
louisiana,
not
because
they
weren't
fit
or
qualified
or
competent
to
do
it,
but
because
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
so
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin.
on
that
july
day
in
1987,
willie
combs
and
wilton
simmons
entered
the
federal
courthouse
in
lake
charles,
louisiana,
believing
that
times
had
changed.
they
were
confident
that
justice
in
a
federal
courtroom
would
be
guided
by
the
promise
made
in
this
city
25
years
ago,
that
they
would
be
judged
not
by
the
color
of
their
skin,
but
by
the
content
of
their
character.
and
we
urge
this
court
to
keep
that
promise.
i'd
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
the
supervisory
authority
argument
was
raised
below,
although
not
in
great
detail.
we
did
cite
thiel
v.
southern
pacific,
and
mr.
baker's
brief
cited
united
states
v.
leslie
in
the
fifth
circuit
cases.
i
want
to
make
sure
that
my
argument
is
clear.
we're
not
suggesting
that
anything
the
judge
does
is
state
action.
what
we're
proposing
to
you
is
a
very
narrow
rule
that
says
when
a
lawyer,
with
a
significant
assistance
of
a
state
official,
racially
discriminates
in
jury
selection,
he
is
engaging
in
state
action.
the
judge
is
assisting
him
in
that.
it's
unconstitutional
per
batson
and
going
back
further
than
that,
per
strauder
and
the
cases.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
because
the
selection
of
the
person
who
is
going
to
sit
on
the
jury
is
a
more
material
decision
which
is
made.
it's
more
inherently
governmental--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--than
who
testifies
in
the
case.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
suppose
that's
true,
justice
scalia,
except
that
the
lawyer
can
always
say,
i
have
no
further
questions,
and
then
the
witness
gets
off
the
witness
stand,
perhaps
without
the
judge
opening
his
mouth.
here,
the
juror
is
not
free
to
depart
until
the
judge
gives
effect
to
the
peremptory
challenge
which
is
exercised
by
the
litigant.
so
to
the
extent
i
think
his
power
is
more
necessary.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
i...
again,
i
think
that's
a
distinction--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
i
suppose
that's
true,
justice
white,
but
i
have
a
hard
time
conceiving
how
that
can
be
a
violation
of
either
equal
protection
or
due
process,
unless
there's
something--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--is
he
a
state
actor?
no,
he's
not
a
state
actor.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
because--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--because
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
not
everything
the
lawyer
does
to
ply
his
trade
in
court
is
going
to
be
state
action.
only
those
functions
which
are
inherently
governmental,
such
as
selecting
a
jury,
are
going
to
be
state
action,
which
he
can
only
do
with
the
significant
assistance
of
the
sovereign.
in
your
hypothetical
example,
he
is
plying
his
trade
as
a
lawyer.
he's
not
doing
anything
that
has
a
constitutional
implication,
because
he's
not
engaging
in
inherently
governmental
activity.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
but
the
manipulation
of
the
system,
under
due
process
guidelines,
is,
i
submit,
not
the
same
thing.
