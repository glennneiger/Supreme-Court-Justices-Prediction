mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
affirm
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
basically
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
has
been
no
showing
of
state
action
in
this
case
which
is
absolutely
essential
for
any
equal
protection
claim.
and
secondly,
unless
the
congressional
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
should
be
given
effect
as
written.
mr.
doyle
has
raised,
but
not
been
able
to
argue,
other
issues
that
are
non-constitutional
in
origin.
these
issues
were
not
raised
in
the
lower
courts,
and
i
suggested
before
and
i
think
i
should
emphasize
again
that
the
reason
these
issues
are
being
raised
now
is
because
of
the
difficulty
of
the
hurdle
of
state
action
in
this
case.
and
while
mr.
doyle
has
said
that
he
was
not
raising
a
cross-section
challenge
or
he
was
not
raising
a
seventh
amendment
argument,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
his
argument
runs
together
the
issues
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
issues
that
have
been
raised
previously
and
rejected
by
this
court
under
other
amendments
to
the
constitution.
under
state
action,
few
would
normally
think
that
the
actions
of
a
private
attorney
in
the
course
of
litigation
within
the
courtroom
constitutes
state
action.
in
this
case,
however,
there
has
been
the
development
of
the
argument
that
the
actions
of
the
attorney
constitute
state
action.
but
the
extent
to
which
there
is
the
expansion
of
state
action
as
a
concept,
i
think
is
reflected
by
mr.
doyle's
discussion
of
jurors
as
governmental
actors.
there
is,
as
we
know,
the
potential
within
some
of
the
state
action
cases
to
expand
it
to
the
point
where
virtually
anything
and
everything
is
state
action.
it
is
true
that
an
attorney
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
but
as
previously
mentioned,
polk
county,
involving
a
public
defender,
was
fairly
clear
that
normally
the
actions
of
a
public
defender
within
the
courtroom
do
not
constitute
state
action.
so
insofar
as
we
are
looking
at
the
private
attorney
in
the
courtroom,
you
wouldn't
normally
find
state
action.
and
i
think
it
was
the
weakness
in
that
argument--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--that's
true.
it
didn't,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
we
have
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
issue
is
here
and
that's
where
i
was
going
to
next,
where
we
have
the
invocation,
especially
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
by
judge
wisdom,
which
focuses
not
on
the
action
of
the
attorney
but
focuses
on
the
action
of
the
judge.
that
is
because
of
the
inherent
weakness
of
focusing
on
the
attorney
as
the
sole
point
for
identifying
state
action.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
but
they--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--sure,
but
we--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--i
think
that
in
all
of
the
state
action
cases,
your
honor,
there
is
always
this
problem
of
identifying
what
the
actual
actor
is
actually
doing.
now,
in
a
number
of
cases
where
the
action
is
one
that
is
itself
is
normally
conducted
by
the
state,
which
is
assigned,
delegated,
controlled,
dictated,
or
anything
else,
where
there
is
some
kind
of
a
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
actor,
not
merely
by
way
of
physical
connection,
but
by
way
of
something
that
is
intentional.
and
if
you're
conducting
a
function
of
a
state...
of
the
state
that
is
otherwise
conducted
in
an
election...
if
you
are
conducting
a
function
that
is
delegated
by
statute,
that
is
coerced,
that
is
directed,
then
the
cases
have
in
fact
attributed
that
kind
of
action
to
the
state.
now,
that's
not
the
situation
here
when
the
judges...
when
the
judge
in
his
capacity
is
involved
in
the--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is
in
the
context
of
your
own
decisions
regarding
the
whole
line
of
cases
on
jury
discrimination.
first
of
all,
until
batson,
there
was
a
very
clear
line
between
the
venire
cases
and
the
petit
jury
case.
now,
batson
changes
that
line,
certainly
at
least
as
to
the
prosecutor.
and
we
are
talking
about
prosecutorial
action
within
the
petit
jury.
but
the
court
came
back
in
holland
v.
illinois
and
made
it
very
clear
that
the
standards
that
control,
generally
in
the
venire
cases,
do
not,
therefore,
necessarily
carry
over
to
bring
the
cross-section
standards
and
other
things
into
the
jury.
so
we
have
to
focus
on
exactly
what
is
being
done
here
by
the
judge.
the
judge
is,
at
this
point...
what
is
he
doing?
the
judge
is
a
state
actor.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
but
it's
not
his
action
that's
in
question.
the
action
in
question
is
the
decision
by
the
attorney.
the
judge
is
not
telling
the
attorney
what
to
do.
the
attorney
is
acting
under
a
statute...
a
federal
statute...
which
is
neutral
on
its
face.
the
federal
statute
gives
the
trial
judge
no
discretion
in
regard
to
the
exercise
at
least
of
the
three
peremptories.
the
judge
is
not
involved
in
making
any
kind
of
a
judgment
here.
the
attorneys
are
not
acting
on
his
direction
or
anything
else.
what
is
really
at
stake...
what
the
real
quarrel
is
with
is
not
with
the
judge.
it
is
with
the
system.
it
is
with
allowing
the
peremptories.
but
there
hasn't
really
been
a
direct
frontal
attack
on
the
statute
itself.
if
you
look
at
judge
rubin's
dissent
for
instance
in
the
en
banc
opinion,
he
says,
nevertheless,
if
not
constrained
by
batson,
the
rules
governing
peremptory
strikes
vest
absolute
discretion
in
the
parties.
the
state
thereby
guarantees
the
effect
of
an
objection
to
seating
an
otherwise
eligible
juror
by
allowing
no
other
to
object.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
that's
a
quarrel
with
the
statute.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
it
comes
from
congress,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
this
is
a
federal
statute,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
in
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
but--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--well
your
honor,
if
this
case
is
decided
on
constitutional
grounds,
it
certainly
has
application
to
the
state.
but
as
justice
rehnquist,
i
think,
pointed
out,
procedures
may
vary
between
a
state
and
a
federal
court.
and
in
fact
they
would
between
a
federal
court
in
louisiana
and
a
state
court.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
i'll
be
happy
to
address
shelley
and
kraemer.
i
think
that
that...
shelley
and
kraemer
is
a
very
different
situation.
the
judge
is
a
state
actor
and
a
state
action
was
attributed
to
him.
but,
your
honor,
in
that
case
what
you
argued,
there
was
in
the
restrictive
covenant
on
the
face
of
it,
before
the
court,
all
the
evidence
of
the
discrimination,
one.
and
two,
the
restrictive
covenant
had
no
force
of
law
until
it
was
enforced
by
the
court.
and
in
fact,
when
it
enforced
it,
it
was
denying
the
right
to
property
that
was
already
in
existence,
because
we
had
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller
in
that
case.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
white
had
said--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--yes,
but
the
judge--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--it
wasn't
just
the
judge
was
enough,
your
honor.
the
judge
was
acting
and
enforcing--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
a
state
court
you
wouldn't
need
the
judge
to
enforce
it.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
the
judge
is
there
and
presides
over
the
trial,
and
to
that
extent,
he
governs
everything
in
the
trial.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
we're
asking,
your
honor,
about
the
action
to
make
the
choice.
the
choice
of
who
is
challenged
peremptorily
is
not
the
choice
of
the
judge.
that
is
the
choice--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--of
the
attorney.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
judge
is
enforcing
the
statute.
the
judge
in
no
way
is
involved--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--he
enforces
the
federal
statute.
there
is
no
challenge
here
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
statute.
that
may
be
where
the
real
quarrel
is.
but
unless
the
federal
statute
is
itself
unconstitutional,
it
ought
to
be
implemented.
but
there
has
been
no,
at
least
direct,
challenge
on
the
constitutionality--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
peremptory
is
part
of
the
overall
process
in
which
the
decision
on
voir
dire,
whether
it
is
to
be
done
by
the
judge
or
whether
it's
to
be
done
by
the
jury.
on
certain
matters
the
judge
has
discretion,
your
honor.
and
in
those
matters
he
is
making
a
choice.
but
if
we're
going
to
look
at
the
specific
action
that
is
challenged,
that
is
the
choice
on
who
is
to
be
stricken.
the
judge
does
not
make
that
choice,
your
honor.
the
statute
doesn't
give
him
that
choice.
and
the
nature
of
a
peremptory
challenge
is
that
he
doesn't
and
can't
make
that
choice.
we
have
to
focus
on
whose
action
is--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--but,
your
honor,
the
judge
has...
courts
have
influence
on
all
kinds
of
things
that
we
don't
attribute
state
action
to
or
governmental
action
to
because
of
the
decisions
of
courts.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
tulsa
case.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
you
were
very
clear
in
that
case,
your
honor,
that
you
had
a
state
statute
that
didn't
give
notice
except
through
a
private
party.
the
function
of
notice
was
one
that
the
state
had
to
give.
the
person
giving
notice
in
that
case
was
fulfilling
a
clear
state
function,
and
it
had
been
delegated.
moreover,
there
was,
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
quite
extensive...
the
court
said
pervasive...
involvement
between
that
private
actor
and
the
state
court
itself.
and
if
you
read
the
language
in
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
did
not
back
away
at
all
from
this
prior
distinction
that
the
court
itself
has
to
control
the
actions.
your
honor,
if
you
take
this
idea
that
anything
a
court
does
to
influence
or
allow
is
state
action,
then
take
the
situation
that
this
court
incidentally
dealt
with
on
first
amendment
grounds,
back
from
skokie,
illinois,
when
you
had
a
nazi
organization
that
wanted
to
march.
and
a
court
enforced
the
first
amendment
and
allowed
them
to
march.
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
that
court
is
somehow
endorsing
what
they
did,
because
they
allowed
them
to
march?
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
between--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
that's
right,
but
not
the
content.
and
right
here--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--the
judge
is
endorsing
the
congressionally
created
right
to
exercise
a
peremptory,
not
what
is
done
in
the
peremptory.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
if
he
has
an
equal
protection
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
by
a
state
actor.
and
if
there
is
no
state
actor
that
has
discriminated
against
him,
he
does
not
have
a
particular
right
to
sit
on
a
particular
jury.
he
has
rights
to
sit
on
juries
under
other
provisions
and
in
addition
to
the
equal
protection
statute.
moreover,
congress
has
gone
much
further
and
protected
the
rights
of
all
citizens
under
the
jury
selection
act.
in
there...
in
that
act,
they
preserve
the
peremptory.
moreover,
the
peremptory
in
civil
cases,
as
i
noted
in
my
argument,
was
created
in
federal
courts
by
the
reconstruction
congress
only
a
few
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
what
little
legislative
history
we
have
on
it,
shows
that
the
reason
it
was
adopted
was
because
of
its
concern
about
discrimination
in
the
jury.
now,
one
can
disagree
as
a
policy
matter
whether
the
use
of
peremptories
is
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea,
and
it
may
be
that
congress
could
or
should
change
peremptories,
eliminate
peremptories.
but
unless
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional,
unless
there
is
an
equal
protection
violation,
then
there
is
no
reason
not
to
implement
the
statute
as
actually
written.
the
quarrel
is--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--okay,
but
do
we
know
that...
in
your
hypothet
i
didn't...
it
wasn't
clear.
is
it
clear
to
the
judge,
has
it
been
announced
to
the
judge
by
the
attorney
what
his
purpose
is?
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
well,
there's
no
reason
why
he
can't
do
that.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
judge
doesn't
know
what
the
reason
is.
if
an
attorney
says,
i'm
done
with
a
witness,
there's
no
reason
not
to
excuse
the
witness.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--well,
what
would
he
do
if
he
told
him
to
continue?
i
mean,
he
can't
force
the
attorney
to
sit
there
and
ask
question,
unless
the
judge
is
himself
going
to
conduct
the
examination.
the--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--judge,
i
think...
your
honor,
i
think
what
is
being
alluded
to
in
some
of
the
other
questions,
however,
on
our...
the
prior
cases
in
terms
of
state
action.
i
do
think
that
apart
from
the
courtroom
situation
by
itself,
if
you
look
at
the
series
of
cases,
that
intentionality
is
often
an
element
in
this
court's
past
decisions
in
deciding
whether
there
has
been
or
has
not
been
state
action.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
in
that
situation
if
you
had
a
statute
that
allowed
that,
you
might
have
a
claim
against
the
statute.
and
that's
been
my
point
all
along,
your
honor,
is
that
i'm
focusing
on
the
statute
insofar
as
an
argument
has
been
made
about
state
action.
if
you're
looking
for
state
action,
the
one
place
to
look
is
at
the
statute,
and
here
there
is
not
sufficient
basis
on
the
statute.
there
might
be
a
way
to
construct
an
argument,
your
honor,
regarding
a
statute
that's
so
distorted
the
possibilities,
that
as
applied
it
in
a
different
case,
you
might
argue
that
the
combination
constitute
a
state
action.
that's
a
different
case,
and
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
it.
all
i'm
trying
to
do
at
this
point
is
to
get
and
make
very
clear
that
this
is
not
state
action
and
those
elements
from
a
few
cases
that
suggest
that
a
judge's
minor
involvement
constitutes
state
action,
require,
it
seems
to
me,
a
distinction
between
the
judge
and
what
the
judge
is
actually
doing
on...
at
a
particular
moment
and
whether
that
action
is,
quote,
"fairly
attributable"
to
him,
as
we
say
under
the
standard
in
lugar.
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
and
the
difference
between
this
kind
of
a
situation
and
the
prosecutor,
it
seems
to
me,
is
great.
the...
fundamentally,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
prosecutor,
who
is
clearly
a
state
actor,
and
therefore,
this
court
didn't
have
to
address
that
problem
in
batson,
you
have
someone
who,
historically,
as
shown
in
a
series
of
cases,
an
effect
that
this
court
took
judicial
notice
of,
had
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct.
and
as
justice
white
said
concurring
in
batson,
prosecutors
didn't
get
the
message.
and
the
court
in
batson,
therefore,
came
back
against
prosecutors.
now,
prosecutors
stand
in
a
very
different
position
than
the
ordinary
private
attorney.
the
prosecutor
is
representing
the
public,
and
that's
why
we
have
both
the
issue
as
to
the
prosecutor
of
excluding
the
equal
protection
argument,
both
as
to
the
defendant
and
as
to
the
members
of
the
jury.
he
isn't
like
a
private
attorney,
whose
primary
obligation
is
to
his
client.
he
has
a
much
broader
obligation
than
that.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
carefully
distinguished
the
issue
in
this
case
by
focusing
on
nongovernmental.
that
is,
in
this
case,
there
is
no--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
are
clearly
other
arguments
that
can
be
made.
and
the
eighth
circuit
focused
only
on
governmental
and
distinguished
their
extension
of
batson
only
to
governmental.
your
honor,
i'm
not
in
any
way
conceding
that
batson
applies
in
the
case
of
a
government
attorney.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that
is
a
different
case
involving
more
circumstances
in
which
one
might
argue
that
there
is
a
state
actor.
and
as
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
the
issue
of
whether
one
is
a
state
actor
is
a
fact-bound
determination.
and
those
are
different
facts,
that
at
least
give
a
greater
argument
that
you
have
a
state
actor
than
that
we
have
in
this
case.
the
statute
that
was
enacted
by
congress
that
is
really
the
basis
for
the
allowance
of
peremptory
challenges
is
neutral
on
its
face.
as
alluded
to
before
as
between
the
parties,
it
provides
equal--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
in
our
brief,
i
think
i
went
through
and
related
the
several
statutes
and
how
each
related
to
the
other,
and
i
think
you
have
reference
to
the...
do
you
have
reference
to
the
inclusion
of
the
particular
provisions
of
the
jury
selection
statute?
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
no
citizen
shall
be
excluded
from
jury
service
as
a
grand
or
petit
juror
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
on
account
of
race,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
has
specifically
set
out
the
jury
selection
and
service
act
that
more
specifically
tells
us
how
those
principles
apply.
and
congress
could
have
adopted
the
position
that
peremptory
challenges
are
open
to
the
possibility
of
discrimination,
and
therefore,
could
have
eliminated
them.
congress
did
not
do
so.
congress
chose
to
preserve
it.
it's
part
of
that
act,
and
that
act,
it
seems
to
me,
implements
that
particular
provision,
because
it
provides
for
the
inclusion.
in
fact,
that
act
goes
far
beyond
anything
this
court
had
done
up
until
the
enactment,
because
it
provided
for
a
much
broader
pool
in
the
venire
than
this
court
had
required.
by
providing
randomness
in
the
venire,
you
increase
the
possibility
that
the
attorneys
will
not
be
able
to
distort
randomness
or
the
cross-section
as
much.
because
prior
to
the
jury
selection
act
of
1968,
federal
courts
themselves
were
not
a
model,
even
in
the
venire,
of
the
kind
of
cross-section
that
we
have
today,
your
honor.
so
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
all
in
that
context.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
the
state's
not
excluding
anyone,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
they're
not
excluded
from
service,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
in
that
particular
case,
but
you're
not
stricken
from
the
venire.
you
come
up
for
service
again
and
again.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
i
think
if
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
its
history
and
the
other
statutes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
in
fact
the
case
that's
always
been
interpreted.
i
don't
think
before
batson
that
anyone
would
have
thought
that
that
applied
to
the
notion
of
the
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honors,
while
peremptory
challenges
are
not
constitutionally
required,
they
are
a
congressionally
created
right.
they
may
not...
they
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
policy,
but
unless
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional
or
unless
there
is
a
clear
case
of
state
action
that
involves,
therefore,
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
statute
should
be
implemented
as
written.
because
when
congress
implemented
this,
it
was
doing
it
to
protect
the
right
of
jury
trial,
and
in
congress'
judgment,
it
was
the
best
way
for
the
parties
to
ensure
a
fair
trial.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
again,
that
was
not
at
all
addressed
below.
the
supervisory
power
is
something
that
the
court
has
power
to
do,
but
again,
i
think
you
run
into
the
issue
of
a
congressional
statute.
we're
not
talking
about
the
federal
rules,
for
instance,
on
the
criminal
side
that
are...
that
come
through
the
court
and
then
go
to
congress.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
was
passed
by
congress,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
supervisory
jurisdiction
would
be
inappropriate
in
this
case
because
of
a
very
clear
congressional
statute.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
cut--
mr.
john
s.
baker,
jr.
--normally,
congressional
statutes
are
implemented
unless
they're
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
