justice
blackmun
this
is
essentially
judge
rubin's
approach--
justice
blackmun
--in
a
panel
decision
anyway,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
you're
not
relying
on
any
notion
based
on
the
proper
cross-section
of
the
community?
justice
blackmun
why?
justice
blackmun
would
it
make
any
difference
if,
in
this
civil
litigation,
the
state
were
a
party?
justice
blackmun
i
know
you
have,
and
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
blackmun
before
you
sit
down,
do
you
have
any
comment
about
supervisory
power?
justice
blackmun
would
be
inappropriate?
justice
blackmun
so
congress
can
cut
us
off
in
that
respect?
justice
blackmun
that's
what
you're
saying.
