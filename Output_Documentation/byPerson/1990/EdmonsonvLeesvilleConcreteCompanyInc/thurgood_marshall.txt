justice
marshall
counsel--
justice
marshall
--where
did
the
peremptory
come
from?
justice
marshall
and
at...
louisiana
enforces
it?
justice
marshall
yeah,
i
know.
but
the
peremptory
is
in
louisiana
and
the
state
courts,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
and
there's
a
difference
[inaudible]
between
the
two.
justice
marshall
so
if
you
say
that
it's
state
and
not
federal,
you're
still
stuck,
aren't
you?
justice
marshall
are
you
going
to
get
to
shelley
and
kraemer?
justice
marshall
that
was
the
law
before
shelley.
justice
marshall
that
was
the
law
before
shelley.
that
was
the
district
of
columbia
case,
butler.
justice
marshall
but
shelley
destroyed
that,
didn't
it?
justice
marshall
did
shelley
say
the
judge
was
enough?
justice
marshall
and
we
have
a
judge
here.
justice
marshall
and
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
marshall
well,
who
could
enforce
this
other
than
the
judge?
justice
marshall
who
else
would
try
to
enforce
it?
justice
marshall
but
that--
justice
marshall
--that's
right.
justice
marshall
but
the
judge
enforces
it.
justice
marshall
he
enforces
the
statute,
the
federal
statute.
