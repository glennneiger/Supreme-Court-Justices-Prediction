justice
white
like
picking
the
jury?
justice
white
are
you...
do
you
say
that
the
defendant
is
raising
the
rights
of
the
jury
not
to
be
stricken
or
is
it
his
own
equal
protection--
justice
white
--you
haven't
answered
my
question
yet.
justice
white
what
is
your
view
of
whose
equal
protection
rights
are
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
white
i
mean
some
of
the
jurors
or
the...
your
client?
justice
white
how
is
he
being
denied
equal
protection?
justice
white
and
why
does
that--
justice
white
--why
does
that
deny
him
equal
protection?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
then
you
shouldn't
have
qualified
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
about
the
white
fellow.
justice
white
well,
now
why
does
that
deny
him
equal
protection?
justice
white
is
there
some
notion
that
they
might
favor
him
in
it?
justice
white
that
just
because
they're
black
they'd
favor
him?
justice
white
well,
you
tell
me
what
it
is.
justice
white
okay,
that
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
person
who's
been
rejected
is
white
or
black.
justice
white
if...
as
long
as
it's
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
white
so
that
was
just
a
plurality,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
i'm
still
interested
in
where
you
finally
settle
down
as
to
whose
equal
protection
rights
are
at
issue
here.
is
it
that...
is
it
your
client's?
justice
white
well,
is
it...
but
including
your
client?
justice
white
and
still...
now
tell
me,
again,
what
equal
protection
right
of
his
is
denied.
justice
white
and
why
is
that
a
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
white
because
it...
because
otherwise
he's
denied
a
right
to
have
negroes
on
the
jury
because
they
might
favor
him
or--
justice
white
--why
don't
you
just
say
you
could...
he's...
that
your
client's
entitled
to
press
the
equal
protection
rights
of
the
jurors?
justice
white
not
that
the
county
didn't
involve
the
selection
of
a
jury?
justice
white
--if
a
lawyer
makes
an
argument
to
a
judge,
asking
for
the
judge's
cooperation
and
the
judge
agrees
with
him,
and
that
judge
is
later
reversed
and
then
the
lawyer
is
sued.
has
he
been...
is
he
a
state
actor?
justice
white
well,
the
judge
is
giving
him
an
awful
lot
more
cooperation
and
help
than
he
is
in
this
case.
justice
white
xxx
the
question.
is
he
a
state
actor?
justice
white
well,
why
isn't
he?
justice
white
on
your
approach
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
here's
a
state-provided
system
to
settle
disputes
in
court
rather
than
by
force
and
that's...
if
you
want
to
collect
some
money
from
somebody,
you
don't
beat
him
up.
you
come
to
court.
