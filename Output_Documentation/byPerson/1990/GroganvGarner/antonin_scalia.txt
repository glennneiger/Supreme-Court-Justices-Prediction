justice
scalia
mr.
gallagher,
in
this
case
you
already
had
a
judgment
from
the
state
court.
justice
scalia
what...
justice
stevens
probably
knows
this,
but
i
haven't
done
any
bankruptcy
work.
suppose
there
hadn't
been
a
judgment.
suppose
you
just
came
into
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
saying
i
have
a
claim
for
fraud.
justice
scalia
it
hasn't
been
tried
yet
in
state
court.
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
what
would
happen?
what
burden
of
proof
would...
it
would
be
a
state
law
claim?
justice
scalia
what
would
govern
under
erie?
you
would
follow
the
state
law?
justice
scalia
so,
if...
let's
see.
if
we
said
that
the
bankruptcy
law
requires
just
a
preponderance
and
the
state
law...
no.
if
we
say
that
the
bankruptcy
law
requires
clear
and
convincing,
but
the
state
law
requires
just
a
preponderance,
what
would
the
bankruptcy
court
do?
decide
the
case
both
ways...
first?
justice
scalia
i
see.
and
it
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
reversed.
whichever
is
the
higher
is
the
one,
because
you
would
have
to
win
under
both,
right?
it's
like
going
high/low.
justice
scalia
what
would
happen
if
we
said
that
the
standard
for
bankruptcy
is
clear
and
convincing,
and
you
have
a
state
law
that
says
it
is
only
preponderance,
and...
this
case,
and
it's
an
unliquidated
claim
however?
you
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court,
suppose
the
bankruptcy
court
determines
that
there
is
not
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
then
what
happens?
justice
scalia
does
the
bankruptcy
court
go
on
to
adjudicate
whether
there
is
a
debt
or
not,
or
just
dismisses
it
and
then--
justice
scalia
so
the
state
would
then
have
to
go
on.
having
decided
first
that
there
is
no
clear
and
convincing,
it
would
then
go
on
and
decide
secondly
whether
there
is
a
fraud
by
a
preponderance.
it
would
decide
the
claim,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
so
it
would
have
to
take
two
cuts
at
the
thing
to
decide.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
what
fun.
would
you
be
satisfied...
would
you
be
satisfied
in
this
case
if
the
rule
were
that
whatever
the
state
rule
is
governs
in
the
bankruptcy
court?
governs
dischargeability
as
well
as--
justice
scalia
i
suppose
if
you
applied
that
follow
the
state
rule
to
fraud,
there
would
be
no
reason
not
to
apply
it
to
everything
else
as
well.
so
if
some
states
imposed
higher
burdens
of
proof
for
some
of
the
other
matters,
i
suppose
we
would
have
to
follow
them
too,
just
in
order
to
be
logical.
justice
scalia
well,
you're
saying
it's
just
an
issue
of
dischargeability,
but
the
issue
of
dischargeability
turns
upon
whether
there
has
been
fraud.
justice
scalia
but
we
have
to
adopt
a
rule
that
is
going
to
apply
where
it
is
not
discharged
too.
what...
you
mean
we
would
come
out
with
a
different...
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
that
argument
if
it
had
been
an
unliquidated
claim,
would
you?
justice
scalia
how
could
you?
justice
scalia
but
he
needs
a
cause
of
action.
he
doesn't
have
a
state
cause
of
action.
there
is
no
debt.
there
is
nothing
to
try
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
it
has
been
adjudged
that
he
has
no
state
claim.
that
is
the
only
possible
subject
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
as
far
as
he
is
concerned.
justice
scalia
right.
