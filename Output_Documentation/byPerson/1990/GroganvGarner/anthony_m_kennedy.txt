justice
kennedy
what
is
your
understanding
of
in
the
eighth
circuit's
view
what
happens
on
remand?
is
it
open
to
prove
in
the
bankruptcy
court
that
there
was
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
you
have
a
new
trial?
justice
kennedy
--and
do
you
think
that's
the
proper
rule?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
the
federal
interest
is
one
in
giving
special
consideration
in
the
event
there
has
been
fraud,
why
not
let
the
state
standard
control?
justice
kennedy
isn't
the
federal
interest
satisfied
there?
why
should
we
have
a
special
federal
rule
to
determine
dischargeability
based
on
burden
of
proof?
why
not
just
accept
whatever
the
state
norm
of
conduct
is,
and
the
state
burden
of
proof
for
adjudicating
that
norm?
justice
kennedy
wouldn't
that
simplify
things
and
vindicate
federal
policy?
justice
kennedy
and
i
understand
that
most
states
with
an
(a)(6)
type
injury
apply
simply
the
preponderance
test?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
a
view
whether
or
not
this
claim
is
more
properly
tried
under
(a)(2)
or
(a)(6)
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
but
that
was
this
case,
actually,
wasn't
it?
the
corporation...
i
mean,
he
just
induced
money
to
go
to
some
other
corporation.
he
did
not
obtain
the
money.
justice
kennedy
but
he
didn't
obtain
the
money?
justice
kennedy
is
federal
securities
fraud
(a)(6)?
justice
kennedy
and
is
federal
securities
fraud,
outside
the
bankruptcy
context,
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
is
it
not?
justice
kennedy
that's
a
rather
odd
policy
to
have
one
federal
standard
to
establish
the
liability
and
the
other
to
establish
the
discharge,
if
it's
a
fraud...
if
it's
a
fraud
component
in
the
action.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
an
illogic
on
its
face,
and
that
is
why
we
shouldn't
adopt
your
standard.
justice
kennedy
well,
not
if
the
petitioners'
counsel
is
correct
that
the
higher
state
standard
always
controls
because
that
establishes
the
debt.
justice
kennedy
but
you
say
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
would
just
apply
to
dischargeability.
justice
kennedy
so
in
that
case
there
is
not
going
to
be
two
trials,
because
there
is
no
debt.
justice
kennedy
and
the
state
standard
would
control.
