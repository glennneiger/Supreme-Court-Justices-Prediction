justice
blackmun
well,
has
(a)(6)
been
pursued
at
all?
justice
blackmun
it
would
seem
to
me
the
briefs
up
here
completely
ignored
(a)(6).
justice
blackmun
say
that
last
again.
it
was
your
understanding
that
what?
justice
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
in
some
respects
that's
a
much
better
subsection
than
(a)(2).
justice
blackmun
mr.
gallagher,
who
are
the
federal
district
judges
involved?
justice
blackmun
i
know.
go
ahead,
give
me
the
other
name.
justice
blackmun
sir?
justice
blackmun
okay.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
does
(a)(2)
cover
all
types
of
fraud?
justice
blackmun
well,
it
applies
to
money,
property,
services,
or
an
extension
renewal
or
refinancing
of
credit
to
the
extent
obtained
by.
i
think
there
are
other
things.
we
might
have
a
situation
where
the
individual
did
not
get
money
or
property
or
services,
but
nevertheless
was
defrauded.
justice
blackmun
why
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
incompatible
with
the
fresh
start?
justice
blackmun
well,
you
have
said
that
about
10
times
now.
i
just
wonder
if
you
have
answered
my
question.
