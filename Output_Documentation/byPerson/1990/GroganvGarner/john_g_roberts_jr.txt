mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
may
1985
a
jury
found
respondent
liable
for
common
law
fraud
and
securities
fraud,
and
he
was
ordered
to
pay
damages.
in
the
wake
of
that
verdict,
5
months
later,
he
resorted
to
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
code,
however,
section
523(a)(2)(a),
specifies
that
debts
arising
from
fraud
are
not
dischargeable.
that
would
seem
to
make
this
a
simple
case.
debts
arising
from
fraud
are
not
dischargeable.
respondent's
debt
to
petitioners
is
based
on
a
judgment
for
fraud,
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
dischargeable.
the
decision
below,
however,
makes
the
case
much
more
complicated.
according
to
the
eighth
circuit,
petitioners
must
try
their
fraud
case
a
second
time
in
bankruptcy
court,
and
this
time
they
must
prove
fraud
by
a
higher
standard
than
was
applicable
when
they
established
the
existence
of
the
debt
in
the
first
place.
why
is
that?
because
congress
said
so?
no,
everyone
agrees
that
the
statute
is
silent
on
this
point.
all
that
congress
said
is
that
debts
arising
from
fraud
are
not
dischargeable.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
must
provide
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof.
and
the
question
is
why
the
court
should
depart
from
the
normal
standard
applicable
in
civil
cases
and
adopt
the
heightened
standard,
when
doing
so
will
have
two
very
adverse
consequences
for
the
bankruptcy
court
system.
first,
it
will
require
full-blown
relitigation
in
bankruptcy
court
of
fraud
cases
when
the
debt
arising
from
fraud
was
previously
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
as
was
the
case
here
under
missouri
law,
and
as
is
typically
the
case
under
the
federal
antifraud
provisions,
the
securities
laws,
the
commodities
laws,
the
false
claim
act,
medicare
and
medicaid
fraud,
and
a
variety
of
financial
institution
antifraud
provisions.
the
second
adverse
consequence
is
that
the
heightened
standard
of
proof
would
make
the
bankruptcy
court
a
haven
for
fraudulent
debtors,
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
to
this
very
real
extent.
to
the
extent
that
the
victims
of
fraud
are
not
able
to
try
their
case
a
second
time,
either
because
of
the
expense
or
because
evidence
has
become
stale,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
may
be
able
to
prove
fraud
by
a
preponderance,
as
they
are
allowed
in
their
particular
state
or
under
the
federal
law,
but
not
by
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
now,
given
those
adverse
consequences,
why
should
the
court
adopt
the
heightened
standard
of
proof?
respondent
gives
basically
two
reasons.
one,
the
fresh
start
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
two,
that
that
was
the
prevailing
view
at
common
law.
with
respect
to
fresh
start,
that
policy
doesn't
apply
under
section
523.
that
is
an
exception
to
the
fresh
start
policy.
fresh
start
applies
to
the...
what
this
court
has
termed
the
"honest
but
unfortunate
debtor",
but
that
is
not
respondent,
who
was
found
by
a
jury
to
have
committed
fraud
that
was
sufficiently
willful,
wanton,
and
malicious
to
support
the
award
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
clear
that
under
missouri
law
in
this
case
and
under
the
federal
securities
law
that
he
is
guilty
of
fraud.
that
establishes
a
debt.
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
bankruptcy
law
to
implement
some
policy
should
have
a
higher
standard
for
establishing
fraud.
in
other
words,
in
weighing
the
debtor's
interest
in
obtaining
a
discharge
against
the
victim's
interest
in
compensation,
congress
has
said
when
there
is
fraud
the
victim's
interest
prevails.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress
intended
to
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
debtor
in
making
that
determination.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
congress
has
made
that
decision.
if
fraud
is
shown,
the
congress
has
decided
that
that
is
a
type
of
debt
that
we
don't
discharge
in
bankruptcy.
and
again,
the
fresh
start
policy
doesn't
lead
you
to
tip
the
scales
one
way
or
the
other
when
you
are
dealing
with
an
express
statutory
exception
to
the
fresh
start
policy.
now
the
other
reason
that
respondent
gives
for
departing
from
the
normal
rule
and
adopting
a
heightened
standard
of
proof
is
that
congress,
in
1978
when
it
codified
this
provision,
must
have
been
presumed
to
be
aware
that
the
prevailing
view
was
that
fraud
must
be
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
now
whether
that
sort
of
presumption
in
the
face
of
congressional
silence
is
valid
would
seem
to
depend
on
how
dominant
a
prevailing
view
we
are
talking
about.
there
are
statements
here
and
there
in
this
court's
decisions
that
suggest
fraud
is
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
they
tend
to
be
more
ambiguous
than
respondent
would
suggest.
for
example,
respondent
cites
addington
against
texas
as
holding
that
fraud
must
be
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
what
the
court
actually
said,
441
u.s.
at
page
424,
is
that
some
jurisdictions
apply
that
higher
standard.
more
importantly,
careful
examination
of
the
common
law
shows
that,
while
fraud
must
be
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
some
jurisdictions,
i
think
a
bare
majority
of
the
jurisdictions,
it
is
in
no
sense
a
dominant
view
such
that
congress
must
be
presumed
to
have
intended
that
view
to
apply.
the
petitioners,
the
respondent,
and
the
government
all
come
up
with
different
counts
for
which
states
apply
the
preponderance
standard
and
which
states
the
clear
and
convincing.
we
think
about
20
states
apply
the
preponderance
standard,
petitioners
think
there
are
a
few
more,
and
respondents
a
few
less.
but
the
point
is
not
to
quibble
over
the
nose
count.
this
isn't
a
situation
which
whoever
comes
up
with
the
most
states
wins.
the
point
is,
even
respondent
concedes
that
there
are
11
states
applying
the
preponderance
standard,
and
he
puts
6
more
in
a
gray
area.
the
point
is
that
if
you
asked
a
lawyer
in
1978
does
fraud
have
to
be
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
the
only
answer
he
could
have
given
was
it
depends.
it
depends
if
you
are
in
california,
which
is
a
preponderance
state,
or
new
york,
which
is
a
clear
and
convincing
state.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
think
it
does,
and
we
think
that
is
the
most
reasonable
interpretation.
it
is
not
impossible
that
there
would
be
different
standards,
but
you
would
have
expected
congress
to
say
so
if
that
was
their
intent.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
and
the
combs
decision
from
the
fourth
circuit,
judge
wilkenson's
opinion
in
that
case
applied
a
preponderance
test
to
the
discharge
question
as
well
under
(a)(6).
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
fit
comfortably
under
both.
there
was
a
jury
finding
of
willful
and
wanton
or
malicious
conduct
to
support
the
punitive
damages,
which
would
seem
to
trigger
the
application
of
(a)(6).
but
there
was
also,
of
course,
a
jury
finding
of
fraud,
which
the
district
court
found
was
clearly
supported
by
the
evidence,
as
did
the
eighth
circuit
on
appeal.
so
we
think
that
(a)(2)
is
also
equally
applicable.
the
point
is
that
the
prevailing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
covers
what
is
known
as
actual
fraud.
there
was
in
the
early
years
of
the
bankruptcy
code
a
suggestion
that
it
may
cover
something
known
as
implied
fraud,
and
congress
made
clear
that
it
covers
only
actual
fraud.
certainly
the
type
of
fraud
at
issue
here,
common
law
fraud
under
missouri
law
or
under
10(b)(5)
of
the
securities
code.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
that
is
true,
but
in
the
bankruptcy
context
you
need
to
establish
the
debt
in
the
first
instance,
so--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
respondent
was
enriched
by
the
fact
that
the
petitioners,
whom
he
defrauded,
did
not
choose
to
participate
in
the
opportunity
that
he
had
available
and
fraudulently
declined
to
advise
them
about.
so
he
was
enriched
to
the
extent
that
they
were
defrauded
of
the
money,
the
property--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
he
got
was
more
valuable
because
the
petitioners
didn't
get
to
share
in
it.
so
i
do
think
that
he
obtained
money
or
property
of
value,
the
shares
in
the
stock
in
the
payout.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
10
percent.
the
compensatory
damages
for
each
petitioner
was
$249,000.
the
jury
added
$24,900
as
punitive
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
he
participates
in
the
discharge.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
remains--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
is
right.
that
is
still
a
debt
that
he
can
collect
if
the
debtor
makes
more
money
after
his
discharge.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
fresh
start,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
