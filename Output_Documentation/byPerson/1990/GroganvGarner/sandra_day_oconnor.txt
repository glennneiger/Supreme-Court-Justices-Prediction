justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
gallagher,
would
you
explain...
i
still
am
confused
about
your
position.
suppose
you
were
in
a
state
in
which
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
was
required
in
order
to
establish
the
debt.
and
the
claim
is
as
yet
unliquidated
and
unlitigated,
and
there
is
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
federal
bankruptcy
proceeding,
and
the
creditor
comes
in
with
that
claim.
what
standard?
justice
o'connor
in
the
federal
bankruptcy
court.
