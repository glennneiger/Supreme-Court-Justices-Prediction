mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
concerns
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof
which
a
bankruptcy
court
must
apply
when
deciding
questions
of
nondischargeability
under
section
523(a)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
is
it
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
that
is
ordinarily
applied
in
civil
cases
or
is
it,
as
the
eighth
circuit
held
in
this
case,
that
the
creditor
must
prove
each
element
of
section
523
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
we
requested
that
the
eighth...
we
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
with
the
eighth
circuit
and
requested
that
on...
that
the
court
specify
what
would
happen
on
remand,
so
that
we
could
retry
either
under
(a)(2)
or,
as
we
had
alleged
originally
in
the
adversary
complaint,
try
it
under
(a)(6),
because
there
were
punitive
damages
assessed
in
the
underlying
fraud
claim,
and
we
believe
we
had
additional
grounds
for
nondischargeability
under
the
theory
that
it
was
a
malicious...
intentionally
malicious
injury
to
the
property
of
the
creditors.
we
asked
the
eighth
circuit
to
clarify
that
and
our
motion
for
rehearing
was
denied.
as
i
understand
the
controlling
precedent
of
this
court,
upon
a
simple
remand
the
case
will
go
back
and
be
retried...
had
this
petition
for
cert.
not
been
granted,
it
would
go
back
and
be
retried
under
(a)(2),
under
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
and
could
be
retried
again
under
(a)(6)
should
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
first
instance
or
the
court
of
appeals
thereafter
determine
that
(a)(6)...
that
the
standard
under
(a)(6)
is
different
from
the
standard
under
(a)(2),
that
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
as
two
circuit
courts
have
held.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
it
was
pursued
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
declined
to
rule
on
(a)(6)
because
he
ruled
in
favor
of
the
creditor
under...
creditors
under
(a)(2),
and
said
a
decision
under
(a)(6)
was
unnecessary.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
petition
for
cert.
merely
put
the
question
of
the
proper
standard
of
proof
under
(a)(2),
and
it
was
my
belief
and
understanding
that
the
question
of
the
proper
standard
of
proof
under
(a)(6)
is
not
before
this
court.
it
is
not
why
the
court
granted
cert.--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--that
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof
under
(a)(6)
is
not
before
the
court.
of
course,
the
court
may
consider
it,
but
it
was
not
part
of
the
question
put
in--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--for
my
clients
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes.
unliquidated.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
what
would
happen?
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
it
would
be
a
state
law
claim
controlled
by
the
state
law.
and
if
the
claim
had...
if
the
tort
claim
had
contacts
with
the
state
of
new
york
where
clear
and
convincing
as
the
standard
of
proof
for
common
law
fraud,
then
the
burden--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
it
would
decide
the
case
under
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
which
of
course
would
carry
the
day
with
respect
to
the
adversary
brought
under
rule
4007
of
the
bankruptcy
rules.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
that
is
correct,
you
would
have
to
win
under
both
in
order
to...
well,
no,
there
would
really
be
two
separate
issues.
one
question
would
be
do
you
have
a
claim,
and
that
would
be
decided
under
state
law
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
vanston
bondholders
v.
green,
which
was
a
1946
decision
cited
in
the
solicitor's
brief
at
page
17.
it
is
clearly,
that
is
controlled
by
state
law.
and
it
is
important
to
the
creditor
to
know
that
he
has
a
claim
or
not,
because
he
will
share
pro
rata
in
the
distributions
from
the
bankruptcy
estate.
but
beyond
that
it
is
important
to
adjudicate
the
issue
of
nondischargeability,
which
means
that
the
debt
continues.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
well,
it
depends
on
the
question.
if
the
rule
were
clear
and
convincing
to
obtain
a
state
court
fraud
judgment
there
would
be
no
debt,
unless
the
creditor
could
establish
in
the
proof
of
claim
process
that
the
creditor
had
a
valid
claim
for
common
law
fraud.
and
you
would
never
get
to
the
stage
of
deciding
dischargeability
because
there
would
be
no
debt.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
state
law
controls
the
determination
of
the
existence
of
the
debt.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
well,
i
believe
it
makes
perfect
sense,
because
the
issue
of
tort
liability
is
quite
apart
from
the
issue
of
dischargeability.
if
you
don't
have
liability
for
fraud
in
the
first
instance,
then
you
never
get
to
the
second
question
of
dischargeability.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
then
there
is
no
debt.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
the
terminated...
the
proof
of
claim
would
be
filed
asserting
a
claim
for
common
law
tort,
an
unliquidated
tort
claim.
and
the
court
would
adjudicate
the
existence
of
that
debt
first,
and
then--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--well,
if
that
were
the
state
law.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
it
would
decide
the
claim
in
the
first
instance,
and
then
if
the
creditor
asked,
would
decide
whether
it
were
dischargeable.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
although
it
would
occur
in
the
same
proceeding.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
because
in
the
bank...
under
the
bankruptcy
procedures
when
an
adversary
is
filed,
and
an
adversary
proceeding
must
be
filed,
then
all
the
issues
that
are
bound
up
in
that
determination,
both
the
existence
of
the
debt
and
the
dischargeability
issue,
come
together
and
are
tried
at
the
same
time.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes.
my
clients
would
be
satisfied.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
issue--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--of
dischargeability
is
a
separate
question
which
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
which
this
court
must
decide.
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof
to
apply
in
523(a)
proceedings,
it
is
our
position,
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
which
this
court...
and
the
legislative
history
doesn't
speak
to
the
issue.
this
court
has
never
decided
the
issue.
and
when
there
is
no
constitutional
implication,
as
there
is
not
in
this
case,
and
when
the
legislative
history
or
statute
doesn't
make
it
clear,
then
the
court
must
prescribe
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--there
would
be
no
harm
from
that
rule,
because
if
the
state
standard
is
preponderance,
the
same
burden
would
apply
with
respect
to
dischargeability.
and
if
the
state
standard
were
clear
and
convincing,
the
same
standard
would
apply
in
dischargeability,
and
there
would
be
no
effect
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
it
would...
it
would
simplify
things
and
it
would
satisfy
my
clients.
however,
i
believe
that
because
the
constitution
gives
the
congress
of
the
united
states
exclusive
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
that
there
is
some
expediency
in
having
a
uniform
rule
in
the
bankruptcy
courts.
but
i
understand
i
am
arguing
against
my
position
here,
potentially
hurting
myself
in
that
position.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes,
and
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate
under
this
section,
because
the
issue
of
dischargeability
is
just
a
monetary
dispute.
it
is
just
a
dispute
between
two
private
litigants
about
the
amount
of
money
which
is
owed
or
not
owed.
and
the
ordinary
civil
preponderance
rule
ought
to
apply
in
nondischargeability
proceedings
under
523(a),
whether
it
is
(a)(2)
or
(a)(6).
the
debt
in
question
arose
from
a
judgment
that
was
obtained
basically
in
a
civil
action
that
was
filed
concerning
the
sale
of
stock.
the
underlying
claims
were
for
common
law
fraud,
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
violation
of
securities
and
exchange
rule
10(b)(5).
a
jury
verdict,
unanimous
jury
verdict,
awarded
the
petitioners
in
this
case
$498,000
in
actual
damages,
$49,000
in
punitive
damages,
and
the
court
later
assessed
a
substantial
amount
of
prejudgment
interest
with
respect
to
the
10(b)(5)
claim.
while
the
appeal
of
this
case
was
pending
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
by
the...
i
am
talking
about
the
appeal
from
the
underlying
judgment,
the
debtor
defendant...
judgment
creditor
below
filed
bankruptcy,
and
the
petitioners
filed
an
adversary
compliant
seeking
to
determine
the
nondischargeability
of
that
fraud
judgment.
shortly
after
the
bankruptcy
was
filed,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
$500,000...
$500,000
plus
judgment
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
here
in
all
material
respects
on
all
three
counts,
common
law
fraud,
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
rule
10(b)(5).
when
the
adversary
was
tried
in
this
case
the
petitioners
relied
on
collateral
estoppel
exclusively,
and
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
bankruptcy
court
was
documentary.
the
complaint
filed
in
the
underlying
civil
action
was
made
an
exhibit
to
explain
the
issues
raised
in
the
underlying
action.
the
jury
instructions
were
offered
into
evidence
to
establish
the
fact
questions
that
were
presented
to
the
jury.
the
jury
verdict
was
introduced
into
evidence
to
show
how
those
facts
or
questions
were
resolved.
and
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
underlying
judgment
were
introduced
into
evidence
to
show
that
those
fact
determinations
were
made
in
a
final
and
binding
judgment
against
the
judgment
debtor.
no
additional
evidence
was
offered
except
the
oral
testimony
of
the
debtor
himself,
who
just
generally
denied
liability.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
your
honor,
as
required
by
missouri
pattern
instructions,
which
is
essentially
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
instruction.
and
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe,
that
with
respect
to
money
judgments
for
fraud
in
missouri,
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
en
banc,
the
proper
standard
of
proof
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
now,
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that
the
five
factual
elements
necessary
to
establish
nondischargeability
under
section
523(a)(2)
were
in
fact
actually
tried
in
the
underlying
action,
and
that
issue
preclusion
was
appropriate
under
this
court's
decision
in
brown
v.
felsen.
and
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
clear
and
convincing
evidence
was
required
to
prove
the
factual
elements
of
nondischargeability
under
section
523(a)(2).
the
district
court
affirmed
that
judgment,
but
the
eighth
circuit
court
of--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--the
district
court
in
the
underlying...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes,
the
district
court
in
the
underlying
action
is
the
court
that
tried
the
original
common
law
fraud
case,
and
it
affirmed.
then
the
district
court
reviewed
the
bankruptcy
court
decision
which,
using
collateral
estoppel,
had
determined
that
that
underlying
fraud
debt
was
nondischargeable.
okay,
so
we
had
two
separate
district
court
proceedings.
one
on
the
issue
of
fraud.
a
second
subsequent
action
2
years
later
respecting
the
issue
of
nondischargeability.
now
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court.
the
eighth
circuit
found
essentially
that
collateral
estoppel
had
been
improperly
applied
in
this
case,
because
the
fraud
claim
was
tried
under
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
that
section
523,
according
to
the
eighth
circuit,
requires
proof
of
the
factual
elements
to
establish
nondischargeability
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
accordingly,
since
there
were
different
standards,
use
of
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
for
factual
issue
preclusion
was
improper.
so
we
are
left
with
the
question
what
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof
under
section
523(a)(2).
the
petitioners'
key
point
in
this
case
is
that
issues
of
nondischargeability
regarding
fraud
judgments
are
simply
a
private
dispute
about
money,
which
is
not
the
kind
of
case
which
requires
a
heightened
standard
of
proof.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
occurs
in
many
states,
but
that
is
not
the
rule
in
missouri.
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--well,
but
that's
already
determined
in
this
case.
the
opprobrium
associated
with
the
finding
of
fraudulent
misconduct
has
already
been
made
under
the
standard
that
is
applied
in
the
local
jurisdiction.
and
the
issue
is
simply--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
because
the
determination
could
likewise
be
made
in
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
creditor...
that
the
debtor
was
a
fraud
feasor
under
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
if
that
is
the
state
rule.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
in
some
states,
not
in
all.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
is
just
like
any
other
form
of
defense
or
exemption
in
an
ordinary
civil
case.
if
i
can
move
to
that
point,
several
justifications
are
offered
for
a
heightened
standard
of
proof.
the
fresh
start
policy,
the
fact
that
the
standard
is
ordinarily
applied
in
common
law
fraud
cases,
or
that
the
standard...
heightened
standard...
is
necessary
to
overcome
the
opprobrium
associated
with
a
fraud
determination.
but
the
decisions
of
this
court,
addington
v.
texas,
price
waterhouse,
which
was
decided
last
year,
price
waterhouse
against
hopkins.
in
herman
&
maclean
v.
huddleston,
which
is
a
10(b)(5)
case
establishing
the
appropriate
standard
of
fraud
proof
under
10(b)(5),
it
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence
under
federal
law.
all
recognize
that
the
heightened
standard
of
proof
is
an
extraordinary
unusual
change
in
the
burden
of
proof,
which
is
only
applied
in
those
cases
where
personal
liberty,
constitutional
associational
rights,
or
the
freedom
of
speech
is--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--the
debt,
the
existence
of
the
fraud
debt
must
be
established
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
in
the
federal
bankruptcy
court,
that
is
correct.
because
when
the
bankruptcy
court
decides
who
owes
who
what
it
applies
state
law
to...
with
respect
to
tort
claims,
contract
claims,
ucc
claims,
state
laws
are
applied
in
determining
the
existence
of
the
debt.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
scott
o.
wright,
the
chief
judge--
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
--dean
whipple.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
dean
whipple.
mr.
michael
j.
gallagher
judge
whipple
was
the
person,
was
the
judge
that
decided
the
issue
respecting
bankruptcy,
and
judge
wright
was
the
trial
judge
in
the
underlying
common
law
fraud
case.
with
respect
to
the
need
to
have
a
heightened
standard
of
proof,
the
argument
is
made
that
the
fresh
start
policy
of
bankruptcy
justifies
that
standard,
and
we
suggest
that
it
does
not.
