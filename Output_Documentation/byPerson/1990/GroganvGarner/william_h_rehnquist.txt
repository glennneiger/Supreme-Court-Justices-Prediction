chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-1149,
coy
r.
grogan
v.
frank
j.
garner.
mr.
gallagher.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
it
is
your
view
that
if
the
creditor
here
had
come
into
bankruptcy
court
with
an
unliquidated
claim,
no
state
court
judgment
in
back
of
it,
and
the
rule
in
missouri
was
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
the
rule
adopted
by
this
court
were
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
all
you
would
have
to
show
in
the
bankruptcy
court
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
notwithstanding
missouri
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
come
in
with
an
unliquidated
claim
arising
in
a
state
like
missouri.
let's
assume
it
has
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard.
even
though
this
court
says
that
in
this
case,
if
we
were
to
say
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
you
would
still
have
to
prove
initially
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
though,
does
it?
at
least
it
doesn't
to
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
district
court
charged
the
jury
in
the
underlying
case
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
of
course
many
states
do
require
a
heightened
standard
of
proof
for
fraud
in
private
disputes
between
parties
about
money.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gallagher.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
fresh
start.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
gallagher...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mcnamara.
excuse
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
justice
kennedy's
standard
encourage
forum
shopping?
i
would
think
that
whatever
bankruptcy
court
you
go
into
would
apply
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
claim
arose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
would
depend
on
where
the
underlying
transaction
had
occurred.
i
mean,
you
can't
just
after
the
fact
say
it
happened
in
kansas
if
it
actually
happened
in
missouri.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
can
sue
someone
in
kansas
presumably
if
you
can
get
personal
service
on
them
there
on
a
claim
that
arose
in
missouri.
and
the
courts
of
kansas,
federal
or
state,
would
apply
missouri
law,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
as
to
dischargeability
then
it's
a
uniform
standard.
but
dischargeability,
the
factors
to
be
proved
are
identical
with
what
is
to
be
proved
in
the
state
claim,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
are...
the
elements
of
dischargeability
are
the
mirror
image
of
the
claim,
aren't
they?
of
the
state
law
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
more
is
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
i
mean
what
other
substantive
elements
to
be
proved
are
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
really
are
talking
about...
you
say
that
it's
one
claim
to...
or
one
step
to
prove
your
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
another
thing
to
prove
dischargeability,
or
to
prove
no...
but
you
are
proving
exactly
the
same
elements
in
each
case,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
you
could
argue
that
congress
never
should
have
made
any
claims
nondischargeable,
if
you
wanted
to
give
the
debtor
the
broadest
possible
relief.
i
mean,
congress
was
obviously
drawing
lines
on
both
sides
of
the
spectrum,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
they
say
why
these
provisions,
why
these
nondischargeability
provisions
were
written
in
if
they
were
contrary
to
that
principle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcnamara.
let's
see.
mr.
gallagher,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1149,
grogan
against
garner
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
