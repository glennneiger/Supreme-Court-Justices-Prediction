mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
first
address
justice
kennedy's
question
early
on
with
which
i
agree
with
the
petitioner,
and
that
is
that
congress
intended
that
there
be
a
uniform
bankruptcy
law.
that,
of
course,
is
what
the
constitution
in
article
i,
section
a
suggests
is
a
uniform
law
of
bankruptcy.
and
that
is
exactly
what
petitioners
suggest,
and
we
agree
certainly
that
to
preclude
inconsistent
results
between
various
bankruptcy
courts
and
to
discourage
forum
shopping,
that
there
should
be
one
standard.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
if
the
courts
were
to
do
that,
judge,
i
think
it
would...
justice,
exactly
what
would
happen
is
that
they
would
encourage
forum
shopping,
in
that
you
could
have
state
a,
which
requires
a
mere
preponderance,
state
b,
of
which
there
are
a
majority,
requiring
clear
and--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--well,
if
the
underlying
court
were
going
to
apply
that
burden,
but
by
filing
your
action
in
one
state
or
another
you
could
dictate
what
your
burden
of
proof
would
be
if
you
had
a
choice.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
yes,
they
would.
but
the
problem
that
creates,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
an
inconsistency
of
result
between
bankruptcy
courts
and
if
congress
intended
for
bankruptcy
courts
to
apply
the
law
of
the
states
in
this
respect,
i
think
they
certainly
would
have
told
us.
they
did
that
with
respect
to
section
522
in
exemptions,
where
in
fact
congress
designated
that
certain
state
exemptions
may
apply
and
that
debtors
have
the
option
of
selecting
between
the
designated
federal
exemptions
and
the
respective
state
exemptions.
there
is
no
such
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
such
a
result.
we
believe
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
court
should
affirm
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
declare
a
uniform
standard
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
first
is
what
chief
justice
rehnquist
alluded
to
at
the
conclusion
of
the
solicitor's
argument,
and
that
is
to
give
life
and
meaning
to
the
fresh
start
policy,
the
fresh
start
policy,
which
is
the
cornerstone,
the
very
foundation
of
our
bankruptcy
laws.
the
second--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--it
would
be
our
position,
justice
stevens,
that
yes,
it
should
apply
to,
at
least
to
(a)(2),
(a)(4),
and
(a)(6),
which
are
3
of
the
10
grounds
for
exception.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
under
the...
no,
we
would
not,
justice.
but
under
those
other
seven
exceptions,
typically
they
are
self-executed.
there
is
no
need,
and
the...
a
creditor
in
such
a
case
is
not
required
to
bring
an
adversary
proceeding
to
declare
a
debt
nondischargeable
pursuant
to
any
one
of
those
other
seven
types
of
nondischargeable
debts.
it
is
only
(a)(2),
(a)(4),
and
(a)(6),
all
of
which
involve
some
fraudulent
or
wrongful
type
conduct.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
no,
it
would
be
under
(a)(2),
justice
kennedy.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
outside
the
bankruptcy
context
it
is,
much
like
a
minority
of
states.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
and
we
would
suggest
that
if
congress
finds
that
policy
choice
to
be
an
unfair
one,
or
one
which
unfairly
favors
certain
judgment
debtors,
that
congress,
as
it
has
in
the
false
claims
act
and
various
other
laws,
is
free
to
amend
the
bankruptcy
code
to--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--well,
there
is
going
to
be,
regardless
of
which
standard
the
court
would
adopt,
there
inevitably,
inevitably
will
be
some
relitigation,
depending
upon
what
the
facts
are
in
the
underlying
case
and
what
the
burdens
of
proof
are.
and
whether
collateral
estoppel
is
applied
offensively
or
defensively,
it
could
be
the
creditors
who
get
the
second
bite
at
the
apple,
not
the
debtor.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
only
for
purposes
of
establishing
the
debt.
but
if
you
had
a
state
where
in
fact
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
fraud
was
clear
and
convincing,
as
most
are,
and
then
in
that
case
mr.
garner
had
won,
had
received
a
defense
verdict
at
trial,
and
then
you
got
to
bankruptcy
and
this
court
were
to
declare
that
the
burden
of
proof
under
523(a)
is
a
mere
preponderance,
they
would
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
because
in
the
same
sense
that
a
criminal
defendant
who
is
adjudged
not
guilty
under
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
does
not...
he
is
not
able
to
raise
defensive
collateral
estoppel
in
a
subsequent
civil
action
under
a
lesser
burden
of
proof.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
if
that
is
the
only
debt
involved--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--that
would
be
true.
that
is
true.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
no,
we
do
not,
justice
white,
as
to--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--as
to
dischargeability.
and
in
an
effort
to--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--in
the
case
of...
if
he
walked...
he'll
come
into
bankruptcy
court
with
a
claim
and
have
to
prove
it
up
there,
as
opposed
to
there
having
been
a
prior
state
or
federal
court
case
on
which
you
have
a
judgment
debt,
then
you
would
be
trying
your
case
for
the
first
time
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
as
to
the
creation
of
the
debt.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
only
as
to
the
elements
of
the
claim.
and
what
we
are
here
today
to
talk
about,
and
the
reason
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
this
decision,
is
because
there
ought
to
be
a
higher
standard
with
respect
to
dischargeability.
dischargeability--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--as
to
the
legal
elements
of
the
claim.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
well,
there
is
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
there
would
be
no
other
substantive
elements
to
be
proved.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
with
respect
to
the
legal
elements
of
the
cause
of
action,
that
is
correct.
but
to
ensure
that
a
debtor
receives
the
broadest
possible
relief,
which
is
exactly
what
congress
said
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
something
more
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
they
certainly
had
to
draw
lines,
chief
justice,
but
the
notion
of
dischargeability
is
treated
throughout
the
legislative
history
and
within
the
code
as
a
separate,
distinct
act,
and
one
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
fresh
start,
which
is
described
as
the
very
essence
of
our
modern
bankruptcy
laws.
and
congress
went
to
great
trouble
to
spell
that
out
in
1978
when
it
passed
the
new
code,
and
throughout
the
house
report
in
particular,
congress
again
and
again
talks
about
the
importance
of
the
discharge,
and
how
exceptions
to
discharge
are
contrary
to
the
very
two
most
fundamental
elements
of
the
bankruptcy
law,
one
of
which
is
the
fresh
start
and
the
other
of
which
is
equality
of
treatment
of
debts
and
creditors.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
well,
those
are
the
few
exceptions
to
the
concept
of
discharge
where
congress
has
determined
that
if
a
debt
is
fraudulently
obtained
that
it
should
not
be
excepted.
so
that
is
where
that
line
has
been
drawn.
but
they
also,
congress
went
to
great
pains
to
ensure
that,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
past,
exceptions
to
discharge
should
be
strictly
construed
against
the
creditor
and
in
favor
of
the
debtor.
congress
added
523(a)(2)(b),
which
requires
reasonable
reliance
by
a
lending
creditor
on
a
false
financial
statement.
that
was
new
to
the
code.
congress
also
added
523(d),
ensuring
that
debtors
could
obtain
attorney's
fees
if
a
creditor
brought
a
nondischargeability
action
in
bad
faith.
congress
declared
that
the
concept
of
provability
of
debts
was
eliminated,
thus
expanding
the
claims
that
would
be
accepted
from
discharge.
they
also
stated
there
could
be
no
waiver
of
the
discharge.
and
they
codified
this
court's
decision
in
perez
v.
campbell
with
respect
to
antidiscrimination.
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
it
is
incompatible,
justice
blackmun,
because
the
fresh
start,
being
the
cornerstone
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
as
this
court
noted
in
local
loan
company
v.
hunt,
that
is
a
matter
of
public
interest
and
it
is
a
matter
of
great
private
interest
as
well
for
the
debtor.
and
to
ensure
that
congress'
intent
is
effectuated
and
that
the
fresh
start
is
available,
the
preponderance
test
is
simply
not
enough.
something
greater
than
the
mere
preponderance
test
needs
to
be
shown
before
denying
the
debtor
what
is
the
very
essence
of
the
bankruptcy
law.
congress
repeatedly
talks
about
the
importance
of
bolstering
the
fresh
start.
this
court
on
various
occasions--
mr.
timothy
k.
mcnamara
--it's
insufficient
not
only
because
of
the
fresh
start,
justice,
but
also
because
of
the
history,
as
just...
chief
justice
rehnquist
noted,
of
having
to
prove
claims
of
fraud
by
something
more
than
a
mere
preponderance.
that
has
been
treated
as
a
virtual
truism.
this
court,
admittedly
in
dicta,
but
on
numerous
occasions
has
acknowledged
that
civil
cases
alleging
fraud
typically
require
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
of
proof.
this
is
not
a
civil
monetary
dispute.
it
is
not
a
mere
civil
monetary
dispute.
we
are
talking
about
branding
someone
as
having
engaged
in
fraudulent
conduct,
and
denying
them
a
discharge,
treating
their
debt
differently
from
all
other
creditors.
in
the
winship
case
this
court
talked
about
the
preponderance
test
as
being
susceptible
to
misinterpretation
because
it
calls
on
the
trier
of
fact
merely
to
perform
an
abstract
weighing
of
the
evidence
in
order
to
determine
which
side
has
produced
the
greater
quantum,
without
regard
to
its
effect
in
convincing
the
trier's
mind
of
the
truth
of
the
proposition
asserted.
the
mere
preponderance
test
does
exactly
that.
it
engages
in
this
abstract
way.
the
instruction
given
in
this
case
in
the
underlying
damage
suit
merely
called
upon
the
jury
as
follows.
the
burden
of
causing
you
to
believe
a
proposition
of
fact
is
upon
the
party
whose
claim
or
defense
depends
upon
that
proposition.
and
the
converse,
if
this
evidence
does
not
cause
you
to
believe
that
proposition,
then
you
should
not
hold
in
favor
of
that
party.
that
abstract
weighing
is
susceptible
to
that
misinterpretation,
and
at
a
minimum
it
seems
that
the
evidence
ought
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
preponderance.
if
in
fact
congressional
intent
to
grant
a
debtor
the
broadest
possible
relief,
as
congress
has
said
it
wished
to
do,
and
if
this
court
will...
is
going
to
effectuate
the
fresh
start
policy,
as
congress
said
in
its
legislative
history
that
it
intended
to
do,
then
something
more
than
a
mere
preponderance
is
necessary.
also
an
argument
has
been
made
that
allowing
a
mere
preponderance
standard
to
prevail
will
allow
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
become
a
haven
for
wrongdoers.
that
is
a
very
similar
argument
as
that
made
in
the
pennsylvania
department
of
public
welfare
v.
davenport
case
last
term,
and
in
that
case
the
court
found
that
because
of
the
congressional
intent
that
in
fact
criminal
restitution
claims
may
be
dischargeable
under
chapter
13.
the
bankruptcy
laws
will
not
be
a
haven
for
wrongdoers
in
light
of
523(a)(7)
and
the
kelly
v.
robinson
case,
and
the
exceptions
to
the
automatic
stay
in
362(b)(4).
the
guiding
light
for
this
court
should
be
the
fresh
start
policy.
this
court
has
noted
that
when
congress
fails
to
specifically
spell
out
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
what
the
burden
of
proof
ought
to
be,
and
absent
any
compelling,
clear
legislative
history,
in
the
midlantic
case
and
in
kelly
v.
robinson
this
court
spoke
of
looking
to
the
whole
law
and
to
its
objectives
and
policies.
and
certainly
the
legislative
history
that
does
exist
with
respect
to
the
fresn
start
policy
and
with
respect
to
the
right
of
discharge
speaks
to
interpreting
this
law
in
favor
of
the
debtor,
and
strictly
construing
it,
as
this
court
did
in
1915
in
the
gleason
v.
thaw
case
against
the
creditors.
thank
you.
