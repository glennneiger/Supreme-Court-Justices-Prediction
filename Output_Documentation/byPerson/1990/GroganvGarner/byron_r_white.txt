justice
white
--upon
a
preponderance
basis?
justice
white
yeah,
well,
that's
what
he
posed.
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
i
mean,
you
would
still
have
claim
with
the
general
creditors,
even
if
you
had
no
preferences,
right?
justice
white
the
district
court
didn't
disagree
that
to
establish
the
claim
a
preponderance
was
enough?
justice
white
did
the
district
court
rule
that
they
had
no
claim?
they
didn't.
it
said
they
had
a
claim,
didn't
it?
justice
white
did
the
claim
that
was
allowed,
did
it
include
punitive
damages?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
the
victim,
if
there
is
a
bankrupt
estate,
let's
assume
that
all
creditors
are
going
to
get
10
percent.
the
victim
of
the
fraud
gets
10
percent
too.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
then
the
remainder
just
isn't
discharged.
justice
white
do
you
say
that
in
case
of
a
claim
that
is
not
liquidated,
and
the
creditor
comes
in
and
wants
to
get
a...
files
a
claim
for
fraud
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
in
proving
up
that
claim
you
don't
suggest
that
the
state
law
does
not
control,
do
you?
