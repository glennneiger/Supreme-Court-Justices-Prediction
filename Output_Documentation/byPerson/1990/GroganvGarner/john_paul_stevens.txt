justice
stevens
mr.
gallagher,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you
take
the
position
that
the
same
federal
standard
applies
to
all
sections
of
the
dischargeability
provision,
and
that
it
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
justice
stevens
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
only
in
establishing
the
claim,
not
in--
justice
stevens
--okay.
i--
justice
stevens
--i
understand.
but
it
doesn't
matter,
because
as
far
as
the
federal
standard
is
concerned
it
is
always
the
same
under
all
sections
of
this...
so
you
have
a
really
kind
of
a
very
simple
approach
to
the
problem.
justice
stevens
of
course
it's
not
just
the
victim's
interest
in
compensation.
it's
the
victim's
interest
in
getting
greater
compensation
on
his
claim
than
all
other
debtors...
all
other
creditors
get.
justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
can
i
interrupt
you
just
to
be
sure
i
have
got
your
position
on
one
thing?
you
are
arguing
on
the
fraud
exception
(a)(2).
do
you,
would
you
say
the
same
standard
applies
to
the
entire
section
523?
justice
stevens
mr.
mcnamara,
can
i
interrupt
you,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
your
position.
is
it
your
position
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
apply
to
all
sections
of...
all
subsections
of
523?
i
know
that
is
not
squarely
presented;
we
have
to
think
about
it
a
little
bit.
justice
stevens
well,
but
then
there
might
be
a
different
one
for
(a)(1),
which
is
a
tax
or
custom
duty,
something
like
that?
you
wouldn't
ask
for
clear
and
convincing
standard
on
that,
would
you?
or
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioners
had
secured
a
fraud
judgment
against
respondent.
while
appeal
of
that
judgment
was
pending,
the
respondent
filed
for
reorganization
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
after
the
fraud
judgment
was
affirmed,
petitioners
filed
a
complaint
in
bankruptcy
court
seeking
a
ruling
that
their
judgment
was
exempt
from
discharge
under
section
523(a)
of
the
code.
that
section
provides
that
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
shall
not
release
a
debtor
from
certain
obligations
including
those
for
money
obtained
by
actual
fraud.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statute
requires
a
defrauded
creditor
to
prove
his
claim
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
order
to
preserve
it
from
discharge.
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
all
of
the
elements
required
to
establish
actual
fraud
under
section
523
had
been
proved
in
the
prior
proceeding
and
held
that
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
require
the
holding
that
the
debt
was
therefore
not
dischargeable.
the
district
court
affirmed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
ruling
that
collateral
estoppel
did
not
apply
because
petitioners
had
proved
their
underlying
fraud
claim
only
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
discharge
exception
the
court
of
appeals
held
requires
proof
by
the
higher
clear
and
convincing
standard.
we
now
reverse,
we
hold
that
a
creditor
need
prove
his
entitlement
to
an
exception
from
discharge
by
only
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
neither
the
statutory
text
nor
the
legislative
history
provides
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
require
a
standard
of
proof
more
stringent
than
the
preponderance
standards
which
generally
applies
in
civil
actions.
application
of
the
preponderance
standard
is
consistent
with
the
structure
of
the
discharge
exceptions
and
with
congress'
intent
that
all
fraud
claims
that
have
been
reduced
to
judgment
be
exempt
from
discharge.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
