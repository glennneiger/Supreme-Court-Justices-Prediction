89-1332,
gene
mcnary,
commissioner
of
immigration
and
naturalization
v.
the
haitian
refugee
center,
inc.--
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
saying
that
a
pattern
or
practice
suit
could
be
entertained
but
apparently
individual
suits
could
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
rule
on
that
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
kurzban,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kurzban,
doesn't
your
statement
that
the
ins
deprived
them
of
due
process
rights,
isn't
it
predicated
in
part
on
the
assumption
that
justice
scalia
quizzed
mr.
dreeben
about,
that
the
statute
confers
some
sort
of
a
life
or...
life
or
property
interest
in
these
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
congress,
mr.
kurzban,
after
a
period
of
months
had
repealed
this
statute
so
that
there
was
no
longer
an
authorization
for
the
things
that
it
provided
for.
would
you
say
that
people
who
had
not
yet
been
processed
had
an
interest
in...
sufficient
interest
to
claim
that
they
couldn't
be
turned
down
because
of
their
liberty
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
congress
can
repeal
it
when
it
wants
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
can
it
condition
it
as
it
wants
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kurzban.
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
