justice
stevens
how
would
the
20,000
people
be
taken
care
of
under
the
procedure
that
you
think
was
proper?
justice
stevens
but
are
you
saying
that
if
they
agreed,
they
decided
as
a
matter
of
litigating
strategy
or
whatever
it
might
be,
that
the
court
of
appeals
making
the
same
decision
was
right
on
the
merits,
then
they
would
have
gone
ahead
and
had
the
20,000
cases
reopened,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stevens
it
would
be
only
to
the
extent
they
wanted
to
continue
their
challenge
to
the
merits
of
the
determination.
justice
stevens
it
didn't
order
the
granting
of
the
benefit
across
the
board.
justice
stevens
just
required
the
hearing
with
these
minimum
procedures
to
be
met.
justice
stevens
and
you
are
suggesting
that
in
a
lot
of
the
cases
it
might
be
harmless
error
because
there
were
other
grounds
for
denying
the
application.
justice
stevens
why
would
an
individual
want
to
assume
the
burden
of
proving
a
pattern
in
practice
if
he
could
win
his
individual
case
by
just
showing
it
wasn't
applied
properly
to
him?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
the
motivation
for
doing
that
if
it
were
not
a
widespread
problem.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
are
you
saying
that
the
word
denial
in
subparagraph
3
of
(e)
is
the
equivalent
of
the
word
determination
in
the
earlier
parts?
justice
stevens
it
says
such
a
denial,
and
it
doesn't
use
the
word
denial
earlier
in
the
section.

in
the
second
case,
mcnary
against
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
no.
89-1332.
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
created
two
broad
amnesty
programs
that
allowed
existing
undocumented
aliens
to
qualify
for
legal
status.
this
case
concerns
the
special
agricultural
workers'
amnesty
program
under
which
specified
alien
farm
workers
could
seek
adjustment
of
their
status
from
the
ins
if
they
could
establish
that
they
have
resided
in
the
united
states
and
performed
the
requisite
amount
of
qualifying
agricultural
work
during
the
established
time
periods.
the
ins
determined
that
saw
status
eligibility
based
on
evidence
presented.
it
determined
their
eligibility
based
on
evidence
presented
at
a
personal
interview
with
each
applicant.
judicial
review
of
a
determination
respecting
an
application
for
saw
status
was
barred
except
in
the
context
of
judicial
review
of
a
deportation
order
which
was
conducted
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
haitian
refugee
center
and
unsuccessful
individual
saw
applicants
filed
a
class
action
in
the
district
court
alleging
that
the
ins'
initial
application
review
process
was
conducted
in
an
arbitrary
manner
in
violation
of
the
applicants'
statutory
and
due
process
rights.
while
recognizing
that
individual
aliens
could
not
obtain
judicial
review
of
denials
of
their
saw
status
applications
except
in
deportation
proceedings
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
district
court
accepted
jurisdiction
because
the
complaint
did
not
challenge
any
individual
determination
of
an
application
for
such
status,
but
rather
contained
allegations
about
the
manner
in
which
the
entire
program
was
being
implemented.
the
court
found
that
a
number
of
ins
practices
violated
the
reform
act
and
were
unconstitutional
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
also
affirm.
the
district
court
had
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
hear
respondents'
challenges
to
ins
procedures
because
the
statutory
language
mandating
preclusion
of
judicial
review
only
applies
to
denials
of
individuals
saw
applications
and
not
to
the
manner
in
which
the
entire
program
is
implemented
by
the
ins.
not
only
does
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
not
barred
judicial
review
of
respondent's
challenges
but
also
as
a
fact
of
the
matter,
the
individual
respondents
in
this
case
would
be
unable
to
obtain
meaningful
judicial
review
of
their
saw
application
denials
or
of
their
objections
to
ins
procedures
if
they
were
required
to
avail
themselves
of
the
limited
judicial
review
procedure
in
the
statute.
given
this
court's
well-settled
presumption
favoring
interpretations
of
statutes
that
allow
judicial
review
of
administrative
action,
we
cannot
conclude
that
congress
so
intended
to
foreclose
all
forms
of
meaningful
judicial
review
of
saw
application
denials
and
general
collateral
challenges
to
ins
procedures.
