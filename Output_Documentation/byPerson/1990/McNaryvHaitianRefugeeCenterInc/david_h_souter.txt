review,
and
that
is
perfectly
true,
but
how
much
time
might
elapse
between
the
denial
of
saw
status
and
a
deportation
proceeding?
how
many
years?
justice
souter
well,
what
if
he
takes
sort
of
a
third
ground,
and
that
is
he
doesn't
really
want
to
precipitate
review.
on
the
other
hand,
he
believes
that
he
is
entitled
to
saw
status
right
now
and
he
continues
to
act
on
that
assumption,
so
that
no
one
precipitates
anything.
the
deportation
proceeding
might
take
place
10
years
from
now
or
20
years
from
now.
justice
souter
as
a
practical
matter,
if
that
is
the
case,
he
will
never
have
any
actual
review
of
what
he
may
now
claim
to
be
a
pattern
or
practice
violation.
