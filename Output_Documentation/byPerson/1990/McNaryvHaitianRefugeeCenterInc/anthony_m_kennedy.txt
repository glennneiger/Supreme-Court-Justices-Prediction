justice
kennedy
i
take
it,
mr.
dreeben,
your
entire
case
rests
upon
the
prohibitory
language
in
the
statute
that
there
shall
be
no
administrative
or
judicial
review
except
as
provided
in
the
subsection.
if
it
were
not
for
the
prohibitory
language,
this
action
would
accord
with
standard
administrative
review
principles
and
the
action
could
proceed?
justice
kennedy
is
there
a
case
that
stands
for
that
proposition
that
i
could
look
at?
justice
kennedy
before
you
do
that,
i
don't
know
if
this
is
necessary
to
your
case,
but
is
this
final
agency
action?
justice
kennedy
is
that
necessary
to
your
case?
