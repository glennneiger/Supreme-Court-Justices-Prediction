justice
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
what
is
the
status
of
the
17
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
have
they
been
through
the
process
a
second
time
and
being
accorded
all
of
the
procedures
that
they
are
complaining
were
denied
the
first
time?
justice
scalia
with
the
procedures
that
they
are
demanding
in
this
suit?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
that
they
have
occurred?
justice
scalia
so
they
have
not
gotten
what
they
are
asking
for
in
this
suit
yet.
justice
scalia
will
the
ins
not
give
them
their
rehearing
with
the
new
procedures
if
this
case
comes
out
against
the
plaintiffs?
justice
scalia
i'm
trying
to
think
if
we're
arguing
about
anything
real
here
as
far
as
these
particular
plaintiffs
are
concerned,
if
they
in
effect
have
been
given
what
they
want.
justice
scalia
may
i
ask
another
kind
of
a
practical
aspect.
you
indicated
that
under
the
district
court's
order
there
have
to
be
20,000
hearings
with...
reopening
applications.
suppose
instead
of
following
this
route
they
followed
the
route
that
you
think
was
proper,
namely
an
individual
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
say
the
court
of
appeals
had
concluded
on
the
merits
exactly
what
the
district
court
did
here.
would
you
then
have
also
had
to
have
another
20,000
hearings?
justice
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
deprivation
of
saw
status
is
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
or
property?
justice
scalia
well,
not
challenging
it...
because,
you
see,
they
are
claiming
that
they
are
being
deprived
of
two
things.
one
is
saw
status
and
the
other
is
the
ability
to
stay
in
the
country.
and
what
you
are
saying
is
you...
the
deprivation
of
the
first
can
happen
without
any
remedy,
if
you
acknowledge
that
it's
a
deprivation
of
something
they
are
entitled
to.
justice
scalia
well,
it
can.
until
the
second
happens...
until
the
second
deprivation
happens,
they
have
no
remedy.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
well,
all
i
want
to
know
now
is
do
you
think
that
the
deprivation
of
saw
status
is
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
within
the
meaning
of...
i
mean,
prior
to
this
statute
they
had
no
right
at
all,
right?
they
were
deportable.
justice
scalia
some
of
the
named
plaintiffs
have
not
yet
gotten
saw
status?
justice
scalia
they
all
have?
justice
scalia
would
that
apply
to
an
immigration
bill
that
permits
immigration
from
foreign
countries
and
says
that
a
certain
number
of
people
shall
be
admitted?
would
someone
who
is
not
admitted,
wrongfully
not
admitted
although
he
is
first
on
the
list
and
meets
all
the
qualifications,
would
he
have
a
constitutional
claim
for
deprivation
of
what,
property
or
liberty,
without
due
process?
justice
scalia
i
know
it
is,
but
how
would
it
come
out?
justice
scalia
but
these
people
were
aliens
in
this
case,
weren't
they?
justice
scalia
why
are
they
not
excludable
aliens,
if
the
assumption
that
they
had
no
right
to
be
here
is
entertained?
justice
scalia
it's
the
same
thing
with
someone
who's
in
poland.
if
you...
you
know,
we
will
let
in
so
many
people
from
poland
who
are
the
first
300
on
the
list.
and
i
am
number
one
and
i
meet
all
the
qualifications,
i
am
denied
admission.
would
that
be
a
deprivation
of--
justice
scalia
--that's
his
claim,
that
the
embassy
in
warsaw
wrongfully
didn't
use
the
proper
procedures
to
get
him
to
qualify.
do
you
think
there
would
be--
justice
scalia
mr.
kurzban,
that
could
all
have
been
reviewed
before
the
deportation
would
occur.
so
if
the
only
thing
we
are
worried
about
is
depriving
the
individual
of
deportation,
we
are
timely
enough.
isn't
that
right?
that
could
all
have
reached
a
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
it
cannot
remand
to
have
a
new,
additional
administrative
record
made?
justice
scalia
they
would
remand
it
to
the
administrator
of
the
ins,
let
him
figure
out
how
to
get
it
taken.
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
remand
it
back
to
the
individual
officer.
back
to
the
head
of
the
agency.
justice
scalia
can
i
come
back?
i
agree
with
you
that
with
respect
to
saw
status
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
remedy,
so
that
that
is
a
problem,
if
that
is
an
independent
liberty
interest
or
property
interest
that
these
people
have.
but
i
don't
know
that
we
have...
that
any
of
our
cases
say
anything
about
aliens,
non-citizens,
people
who
have
no
right
to
be
here,
except
that
they
have
a
liberty
interest
in
not
being
deported.
but
that
is
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
whether
they
have
a
liberty
interest
in
obtaining
saw
status.
justice
scalia
of
due
process
with
respect
to
the
liberty
and
property
interests
that
they
have...
that
have
been
conferred
upon
them.
but
that
is
the
whole
issue,
whether
they
have
been
given
any
liberty
or
property
interest
in
saw
status.
justice
scalia
but
it
may
say
that
with
respect
to
people
abroad,
and
we
would
not
hold,
i
am
confident,
that
those
people
abroad
had
been
given
any
right
to
enter
the
united
states
which
requires
due
process
protections.
justice
scalia
that's
standard
administrative
law,
mr.
kurzban,
isn't
it?
you
speak
of
pattern
and
practice
review
as
though
it's
part
of
the
judicial
function
to
review
administrative
action
in
the
abstract
and
make...
shape
up
the
agencies,
make
sure
that
their
rules
are
good,
and
so
forth.
but
that
in
fact
is
not
the
way
we
function.
abbott
labs
says
that
a
rule
can
be
as
wrong
as
you
like,
i
mean
wrong
on
its
face,
and
we
would
say
unless
that
rule
now,
here
and
now
immediately
affects
you,
you
cannot
get
it
reviewed.
you
have
to
wait
until
the
rule
is
applied
against
you,
and
then
have
it
reviewed
in
the
course
of
adjudication.
that's
standard
administrative
law.
justice
scalia
well,
one
would
assume
that
they
intend
the
normal
application
of
administrative
law,
unless
they
say
something
to
the
contrary.
justice
scalia
that
brings
you
back
to
abbott
labs
again,
mr.
kurzban.
there
are
only
two
ways
you
get
into
court.
either
the
adjudication
is
hurting
me,
or
the
rule
or
the
practice
is
independently,
right
now
hurting
me,
because
i
have
to
put
labels
on
my
bottles
and
i
don't
know
how
to
act,
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
scalia
but
you're
saying
you
are
being
hurt
not
because
of
the
mere
existence
of
the
practice
or
the
rule,
but
because
of
the
harm
that
that
practice
or
rule
produces
in
the
adjudications.
and
the
way
to
get
that
reviewed
under
standard
administrative
law
process
is
to
go
through
the
adjudication
and
then
go
to
the
court
where
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
the
statute
says
that
adjudication
is
appealed
to.
in
this
case
it's
the
court
of
appeals,
and
your
case
has
to
be
brought
in
district
court.
if
we
allowed
this
kind
of
an
end
run
around
adjudications
for
every
rule
or
practice,
we
would
disrupt
the
specification
of
which
courts
these
appeals
go
to.
