mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
address
justice
scalia's
question
with
respect
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
and
the
class
here.
under
the
appropriate
procedures
consistent
with
due
process,
all
individual
plaintiffs
were
granted
saw
worker
status.
in
addition,
12,000
of
the
class
members,
once
the
appropriate
due
process
procedures
were
applied,
were
all
granted
source...
saw
status.
there
are
other
applications
that
have
been
held
pending
resolution
in
this
case.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
no,
all
of
them--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
don't
believe
they
would,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
other
class
members,
and
remember
this
was
brought
as
a
class
action...
there
are
at
least
8,000
or
more
applications
that
are
still
pending,
in
effect,
resolution
of
this
case,
and
they
would
be
denied,
we
believe,
the
benefits
if
we
did
not
prevail
in
this
case.
the
government
talks
about
the
facts
in
this
case
in
some
sense
as
being
abstract.
there
is
nothing
abstract
about
the
facts
in
this
case.
in
1986
congress
granted
an
entitlement
to
individual
saw
applicants
to
apply
for
this
benefit
and
to
have
a
benefit
granted
for
them
if
they
qualified.
the
undisturbed
record
below
indicates
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
effect
snatched
that
right
away
from
these
individuals
by
systematically
violating
their
due
process
rights.
the...
the
methods
that
the
government
used
here
on
these
applications
resulted,
as
the
district
court
said
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
deprive
these
applicants
of
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
their
claims.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
congress
intended
to
do
that
here.
they
intended
to
give
them
both
a
property
interest
and
a
liberty
interest.
they
intended
under
this
statute,
if
they
qualified,
the
government
shall
grant
the
status.
there
was
no
question
about
it.
if
they
met
the
appropriate
days,
if
they
met
the
other
criteria
under
the
statute,
they
were
entitled
to
the
benefit.
so
i
think
this--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
i
think
that
is
a
different
issue.
it
would
depend--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--i
think
one
might
invoke
other
doctrines
concerning
the
exclusion
of
aliens,
particularly
where
if
congress
passed
a
law--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--but
they
are
not
excludable
aliens,
and
i
think
the
court's
hypothetical
really
goes
to--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--but
once
congress
granted
that
right,
as
they
did
here,
they
said
if
you
qualify
you
are
eligible
for
that
right--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
i
would
say
if
you
were
denied
admission
because
the
government
has
exercised
inappropriate
due
process
procedures--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
the
only
thing
i
would
say
about
that
hypothetical
is
that
this
court
has
traditionally
made
a
distinction
between
excludable
aliens,
that
is
people
who
are
at
the
border
seeking
admission
into
the
united
states,
and
deportable
aliens.
the
saw
workers
for
the
most
part
were
here
in
the
united
states
and
they
were
seeking
this
entitlement
here.
the
government...
the
congress
recognized
that
they
were
in
the
country,
and
that
as
a
deportable
alien
in
the
united
states
they
would
have
a
greater
entitlement
interest.
the...
on
the
facts
of
this
record--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
there
were
applicants,
and
there
was
a
procedure
set
forth,
a
specific
procedure
in
this
case,
set
forth
for
aliens
who
were
outside
of
the
united
states.
but
the
class
of
people
in
this
lawsuit
on
these
facts
were
all
farm
workers
who
were
in
the
united
states
already.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that
is
correct.
the...
i
would
like
to
take
on
the
government's
major
notion,
here,
which
is
that
somehow
we
could
have
gotten
review
somewhere
else.
the
kinds
of
due
process
violations
that
occurred
in
this
case
were
ones
that
could
have
not
been
remedied
in
the
administrative
process,
and
could
not
have
been
remedied--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
give
an
example.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
well,
in
a
hypothetical
situation
if
they
could
have
been,
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
would
say
still
that
the
procedure
that
was
set
out
in
this
statute
was
designed
to
look
at
the
merits
determinations.
that
is,
when
congress
talked
about
an
application,
a
determination
respecting
an
application
and
they
talked
about
a
narrow
scope
of
review
provision,
they
were
talking
about
a
merits
determination
in
this
case.
they
weren't
talking
about
in
effect
the
machinery
that
was
used
to
create
that
determination.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
however,
and
i
would
like
to
give
one
example
of
two
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
there
were
two
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
who
submitted
an
application
at
the
legalization
office.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
the
legalization
officer
who
first
hears
this
is
not
an
administrative
law
judge.
he
is
not
a
person
who
has
the
authority
to
take
discovery
or
to
do
detailed
fact
finding.
he
is
only
there
solely
for
the
purpose
of
doing
fact
finding
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
individual
is
eligible
for
the
claim,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
farm
worker
had
enough
days
and
whether
or
not
the
farm
worker
was
otherwise
admissible.
he
is
not
there
and
cannot
do
a
kind
of
due
process
analysis
required.
and
the
example
here
is
that
after
he
went
through
the
legal...
these
two
plaintiffs
went
through
this
legalization
officer's
hearing,
and
the
application
was
approved
at
that
level,
it
was
thereafter
denied
at
the
level
of
the
regional
processing
facility.
it
was
denied
on
a
form
letter
denial
saying
that
the
person
didn't
meet
the
eligibility
requirements
because
they
were
not
credible.
it
then
went
to
the
legalization
appeals
unit.
at
the
level
of
the
legalization
appeals
unit,
again,
there
was
a
form
letter
denial
that
said
you
did
not
provide
sufficient
information.
in
fact,
as
a
result
of
the
district
court
action,
we
learned
that
the
reason
for
this
application's
denial
was
because
the
government
maintained
a
secret
list.
they
maintained
a
secret
list
of
contractors
that
the
applicants
had
absolutely
no
way
of
knowing
was
the
factor
and
the
sole
basis
for
denying
the
individual
claim.
and
as
the
district
court
said,
this
did
not
happen
in
two
cases.
it
did
not
happen
in
hundreds
of
cases.
it
happened,
in
the
court's
view,
in
thousands
of
cases
where
the
government
was
relying
on
a
secret
list.
now
let--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia,
and
the
reason
is
that
if
we
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
under
1160(e)(b)(3),
which
is
the
section
defining
the
scope
of
review,
the
court
of
appeals
is
limited
solely
to
the
administrative
record
as
it
existed
at
the
time.
period.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
the
government's
claim
here
is
that
it
could
be
remanded
under
the
hobbs
act.
we
would
suggest
that
first
of
all
the
hobbs
act
is
not
applicable.
the
statute
1160(e),
nowhere
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
incorporates
the
hobbs
act.
secondly,
the
hobbs
act
itself
under
the
terms
of
the
hobbs
act
doesn't
incorporate.
and
third,
who
would
they
remand
it
back
to?
they
could
only
remand
it
back
to
the
administrative
agency
here,
to
a
legalization
officer
who
cannot
take
discovery
on
due
process
claims,
who
is
not
an
administrative
law
judge,
who
is
not
a
person
who
can
make
determinations
as
to...
and
as
this
court
has
noted
in--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--because
then
i
think
we're
thwarting
what
congress
intended
here.
congress
said
that
there
is
to
be
a
narrow
scope
of
review,
we
believe,
on
the
merits
determinations
of
these
claims,
but
it
was
to
be
a
narrow
scope
of
review
on
these
claims.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
but
i
think
congress...
i
am
sorry,
this
court
has
always
recognized,
since
the
19th
century,
that
with
respect
to
deportable
aliens,
that
those
deportable
aliens
have
constitutional
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
but
here
the
congress
has
said
if
you
work
90
days,
if
you
maintained...
if
you
were
otherwise
admissible,
you
are
entitled
to
this.
they
said
it,
and
they
also
said
you
are
entitled
to
work
authorization,
which
is
an
independent
property
interest
in--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--and
that
is
an
issue,
justice
scalia,
respectfully,
that
is
left
for
another
day,
because
that
is
not
an
issue
that
is
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
a
case
involving
deportable
aliens.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
question,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
because
the
statute
being
repealed,
i
think
the
entitlement
is
created
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
given
them
that
entitlement.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that
is
right.
congress
can
repeal
that.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
it
can
condition
it,
i
believe,
as
well.
but
here
it
didn't
condition
it
in
the
ways
that
are
meaningful
for
purposes
of
review.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
circuit
court's
review.
the
government
is
suggesting
here
that
somehow
you
could
get
review
in
the
circuit
court
on
these
issues,
and
what
i
would
like
to
focus
on
are
the
actual
facts
in
this
case,
not
some
abstract
proposition.
the
question
of
the
secret
evidence
would
have
never
even
arisen
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
because
no
one
knew
about
it,
number
one,
and
number
two,
because
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
limited
to,
solely,
as
it
says,
to
the
administrative
record.
that
is
a
sufficient
limitation
that...
the
hobbs
act
clearly
doesn't
apply
here,
and
we
couldn't
get
around
that
limitation,
and
that
on
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act
itself
it
doesn't
apply.
and
i
would
like
to
address
the
issue
raised
by
justice
souter
with
respect
to
these
other
conditions.
in
order
to
get
into
that
circuit
court
of
appeals
review,
assuming
that
it
would
be
meaningful,
and
we
believe
it
would
not
here,
one
would
have
to
do
a
number
of
things.
one
would
have
to
be
arrested.
one
would
have
to
subject
themselves
to
a
deportation
proceeding.
and
then
one
would
still
be
left,
as
the
government
has
conceded,
to
the
discretion
of
a
district
director,
the
very
person
that
we
have
sued
in
this
case,
up
to
his
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
put
that
individual
in
a
deportation
proceeding.
we
would
submit
that
these
types
of
conditions
are
impermissible
when
you
are
dealing
with
procedural
due
process
claims.
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
rusk
v.
cort,
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich,
that
conditioning
these
types
of
claims,
constitutional
claims,
is
impermissible.
so
that
these
other
conditions,
aside
from
the
practical
aspects...
because
what
is
the
government
really
saying
here?
the
government
is
saying
that
congress
intended
to
allow
100,000
or
20,000
cases
to
go
to
an
administrative
decision,
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
for
what
purpose?
simply
to
be
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
to
have
a
merits
determination.
that
is
not
what
congress
intended
here.
a
fair
reading
of
1160(e)
is
that
these
provisions
for
review
limit
review
once
there
is
a
merits
determination.
there
is
no
point
served
in
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
or
its
legislative
history
requiring
people
to
go
through
hearings,
useless
hearings,
only
to
go
back
again
on
the
merits.
and
remember,
congress
allowed
this
program
only
for
18
months.
they
wanted
to
have
everyone
have
their
cases
decided
within
that
18-month
period.
it
is
silly
to
assume
that
congress
intended
here
to
go
through
all
these
meaningless...
hearings
that
may
take
several
years,
may
take
10
years
or
more,
simply
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
on
a
merits
determination
where
at
that
point,
3,
4,
5
years
later,
even
if
they
could
be
put
through
that
proceeding,
that
they
would
be
able
at
that
point
to
prove
their
claims.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that
is
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think
you're
right
in
certain
respects.
so
the
question
really
turns
here,
not
on
general
principles
of
administrative
law,
but
what
congress
intended
under
this
statute.
and
we
would
submit
that--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--but
the
plaintiffs,
particularly
when
it
involves
a
due
process
claim,
have
a
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
unless
the
government
can
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
congress
intended
otherwise.
and
here
the
language
doesn't
support
the
government's
claim.
at
worst
for
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
language
is
ambiguous.
the
legislative
history
certainly
rejects
the
government's
claim.
the
legislative
history
here,
and
this
court
relied
on
contemporaneous
and
judicial
interpretation
in
lindahl
when
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
judicial
review
in
the
district
court.
in
this
case
the
contemporaneous
judicial
construction
of
1105(a),
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
as
the
government
concedes
based
on
jean
v.
nelson,
based
on
haitian
refugee
center
v.
smith,
were
cases
that
said
you
could
have
judicial
review
of
pattern
and
practice
cases.
secondly,
the
legislative
history
here,
the
senate
version
of
the
bill,
senate
1200,
was
a
provision
that
would
have
prevented
the
kind
of
class
action
that
was
brought
in
this
case.
that
provision
was
rejected.
and
it
was
rejected
not
as
the
government
suggests,
as
a
tradeoff
for
the
house
bill.
there
was
the
house
bill
and
there
was
the
senate
bill,
and
the
senate
bill
was
simply
rejected.
period.
there
was
no
compromise
between
the
house
and
the
senate
bill.
third,
and
i
think
unfortunately,
and
i
think
this
is
just
simply
an
error,
the
government
miscites
the
legislative
history.
they
cite
the
provision...
in
their
reply
brief
they
cite
a
provision
that
says
congress
intended
this
to
only
be
the
review,
and
they
underline
only.
but
the
legislative
history
there
that
they
are
citing
to
is
not
the
farm
worker
legislative
history,
it
is
not
the
legislative
history
of
1160(e).
it's
the
legislative
history
of
1255,
the
other
amnesty
program.
so
the
government
has
no
legislative
history.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
well,
i
think
what
it
means,
justice
o'connor,
is
within
this
context
when
you
look
at
1160(e)(2)(a),
(e)(2)(b),
and
(e)(3),
when
they
are
talking
about
a
determination,
a
determination
is
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
if
someone
here
was
denied
status
because
they
didn't
qualify
that
they
could
somehow
go
into
district
court.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
congress
here
didn't
use
broad
language
like
any
claims
arising
under,
as
they
did
in
the
medicare
context,
or
they
didn't
use
the
language
which
this
court
didn't
even
find
persuasive
under
the
veterans
administration
case,
where
the
congress
said
any
issue
of
law
in
fact
under
any
law
by
the
administrator--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--but
that's
where
on
the
record
you
could
get
a
review.
these
practices
were
practices
of
such
a
nature
that
they
were
extrinsic
to
the
record.
they
were
practices,
due
process
violations,
that
were
not
in
the
record,
that
an
individual
couldn't
get
review.
and
abbott
labs
and
the
other
cases
go
to
an
assertion
that
under
normal
circumstances
on
a
merits
determination.
and
for
that
reason
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
language.
congress--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--yes,
i
think
it
is
final
agency
action.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
i
think
this
is
a
case
involving
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
so
that
whether
or
not
ultimately
there
was
a
final
agency
action
in
any
individual
case
is
not
necessary.
the
government
doesn't...
in
fact,
the
government
really
doesn't
contest,
justice
kennedy,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
individuals
were
harmed,
and
the
record
is
undisturbed
below
that
in
the
individuals'
cases
they
were
directly
harmed.
they
were
denied
their
right
to
work,
they
were
denied
this
entitlement
benefit.
the...
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
language,
because
the
language
of
the
statute
says
respecting
a
determination
of
an
application.
when
that
is
looked
at
in
terms
of
(e)(2)
and
(e)(3),
the
narrow
scope
of
review,
that
is
congress
intended
a
sort
of
consistently
narrowing
of
the
review,
first
at
the
administrative
level
and
then
at
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
sensible
reading
of
that
when
looked
at
as
a
whole
is
that
the
intention
was
on
the
merits
on
a
final
determination
in
a
case
that
the
administrative
appeals
would
be
limited
to
the
record
and
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
be
even
further
limited
to
the
record.
and
that
they
were
not
talking
about
here,
where
there
were
wholesale
constitutional
violations
that
were
extrinsic
to
the
record
itself.
this
court--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--yes,
i
think
it
is.
in
other
words--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--that's
correct.
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
that
is
what
it
refers
to,
and
it
means
the
denial
on
the
merits.
the
one
final
argument
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
that
this
court
has
recognized,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
in
the
bowen
case
and
has
made
a
distinction
in
a
statute
that
is
far
broader
than
this
statute
here.
under
the
medicare
act
it
says
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
any
claims
arising
under
the
statute.
far
broader
than
the
language
here
respecting
a
determination,
and
yet
this
court
properly
crafted
an
exception
saying
that
when
it
goes
to
the
methods,
when
it
goes
in
effect
to
the
underlying
machinery
for
determining
the
claim.
in
this
case
the
government
sabotaged
in
effect
that
machinery,
not
allowing
an
individual
in
the
normal
administrative
course,
to
have
their
claim
heard.
and
we
would
submit
that
this
case
in
many
respects
is
like
bowen
for
that
reason.
thank
you.
