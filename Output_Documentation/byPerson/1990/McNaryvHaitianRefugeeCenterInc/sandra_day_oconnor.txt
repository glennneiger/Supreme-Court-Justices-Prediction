justice
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
i
thought
one
of
the
problems
was
that
there
was
no
record
made
of
some
of
these
proceedings,
so
there
was
no
way
ultimately
to
review
it?
justice
o'connor
is
that
correct?
was
that
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
district
court?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
is
also
suggested
that
perhaps
there
is
no
review
possible
unless
there
is
a
deportation
order
entered.
justice
o'connor
do
we
face
potentially
a
situation
where
in
fact
there
is
no
deportation
order,
and
so
an
individual
claimant
wouldn't
be
able
to
raise
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
scheme
also
envisions,
as
i
understand
it,
that
information
produced
at
these
hearings
should
not
be
used
by
the
ins
to
thereafter
oust
them,
simply
because
the
alien
has
come
in
and
has
requested
this
status.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
faced
with
the
situation
in
one
of
these
cases
where
no
review
could
as
a
practical
matter
be
obtained
without
giving
up
the
confidentiality
or
something
of
that
sort,
do
we
have
a
webster
v.
doe
problem
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
dreeben,
what
about
bowen
v.
the
michigan
academy
case?
that
seems
to
point
in
the
other
direction,
doesn't
it?
justice
o'connor
will
they
be
deprived
of
that
status
if
the
government
prevails
here?
justice
o'connor
--indeed
are
there
any
of
these
saw
applicants
who
are
not
already
in
the
country
and
applying?
justice
o'connor
there
are.
justice
o'connor
so
the
class
of
respondents
before
us
today
consists
entirely
of
people
who
were
in
fact
in
this
country?
justice
o'connor
and
were
deportable,
absent
being
given
the
saw
status.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
kurzban,
the
language
of
section
1160
says
there
shall
be
no
judicial
review
of
a
determination
respecting
an
application
for
saw
status,
except
in
accord
with
the
subsection.
i
don't
find
that
ambiguous.
how
is
that
ambiguous?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
dreeben,
isn't
more
at
stake
than
just
deportation?
if
you
get
saw
status,
doesn't
that
entitle
the
alien
to
get
a
work
permit
and
to
work
and
to
come
out
from
underground,
so
to
speak?
so
we
are
talking
about
something
more
than
deportation,
it
seems
to
me.
