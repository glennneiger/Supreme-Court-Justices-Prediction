mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
legalization
or
amnesty
provisions
of
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
judicial
review
provisions
of
that
act
preclude
district
courts
from
entertaining
broad
pattern
or
practice
claims
directed
at
ins
activities
in
processing
particular
legalization
applications.
the
eleventh
circuit
upheld
district
court
jurisdiction
on
such
a
theory.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
is
incorrect.
the
statute
is
carefully
structured
to
channel
all
review
of
determinations
respecting
legalization
applications
to
a
single
time
and
place,
namely
a
statutory
review
proceeding
after
the
entry
of
a
deportation
or
exclusion
order.
the
eleventh
circuit's
departure
from
this
framework,
based
on
a
nonstatutory
pattern
and
practice
exception,
frustrates
congress'
purposes
in
limiting
review,
imposes
burdens
on
the
courts,
and
intrudes
into
the
ins'
difficult
and
critical
role
in
administering
the
legalization
program.
the
statute's
requirement
of
case-by-case
review
responds
to
the
sheer
magnitudes
and
demands
of
the
legalization
program.
the
statute
represented
a
unique
undertaking
by
congress
to
offer
millions
of
undocumented
aliens
the
opportunity
to
adjust
their
status
to
that
of
permanent
resident
and
ultimately
to
citizen.
nearly
3.1
million
applications
were
received
by
the
ins
which
had
to
be
processed
in
less
than
2
years
at
the
initial
stage.
congress
conceived
this
as
a
one-time
program.
and
in
recognition
of
the
burdens
that
would
be
imposed
on
ins
in
attempting
to
administer
it,
congress
carefully
structured
and
limited
judicial
review
and
administrative
review
to
prevent
various
burdens
from
preventing
the
ins
from
accomplishing
its
function.
the
centerpiece
of
the
statute
is
a
careful
structure
that
is
designed
to
channel
all
judicial
review
into
the
one
opportunity
that
an
alien
has
to
challenge
either
a
deportation
or
an
exclusion
order
that
threatens
to
remove
him
from
the
country.
this
system
serves
many
of
the
purposes
that
underlie
any
system
that
eliminates
piecemeal
review
of
legal
issues
apart
from
the
final
results
on
benefits
applications.
it
requires
that
remedies
be
exhausted,
thereby
giving
the
agency
the
opportunity
to
formulate
policy
and
to
ensure
that
there
are...
whatever
grounds
are
available
to
determine
whether
the
alien
qualifies
or
does
not
qualify
are
fleshed
out
at
the
administrative
level.
it
creates
a
concrete
record
so
that
when
a
court
ultimately
reviews
the
legalization
determination
it
will
not
set
aside
agency
action
for
non-prejudicial
errors
or
abstract
legal
questions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
the
district
court
addressed
that
concern
at
all.
the
concern
has
been
raised
by
respondents
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
adequately
review
some
of
the
constitutional
claims
that
have
been
made
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
disagree
with
that
completely.
the
claims
that
are
raised
in
this
case
regarding
the
burden
of
proof,
regarding
the
availability
of
translators,
regarding
the
adequacy
with
which
a
record
is
made,
can
be
raised
before
a
court
of
appeals.
and
if
a
court
of
appeals
determines
that
there
is
some
constitutional
error
that
requires
setting
aside
a
particular
denial
it
can
remand
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
can
readjudicate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
that
is
exactly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
in
theory
the
ins
has
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
institute
deportation
proceedings.
and
so
an
alien
who
is
denied
his
legalization
application
and
wants
judicial
review
and
comes
to
the
ins
and
says
please
put
me
in
deportation
proceedings
so
i
can
eventually
get
access
to
the
courts,
in
theory
could
be
frustrated.
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
in
this
record
that
that
has
ever
happened,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
it
ever
will
happen.
the
ins
is
an
agency
whose
mission
it
is
to
remove
illegal
aliens
from
the
united
states.
and
if
an
alien
comes
to
the
ins
and
requests
this
procedure,
there's
no
indication
that
it
won't
happen.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct.
congress
gave
confidentiality
treatment
to
aliens,
but
only
at
one
stage
of
the
process.
only
at
the
stage
of
applying
for
legalization
and
having
that
legalization
application
determined
through
the
process
of
administrative
review.
congress
never
extended
that
confidentiality
protection
to
judicial
review.
congress
always
contemplated
that
judicial
review
would
take
place
only
in
the
context
of
deportation
proceedings.
and
it
had
some--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
in
the
unique
context
of
immigration,
in
which
congress
has
plenary
power
to
distribute
benefits
and
to
effect
the
removal
of
illegal
aliens,
congress
has
great
latitude
to
craft
a
system
that
would
serve
important
government
interests
in
allowing
judicial
review
but
preventing
burden
to
the
courts.
here
congress
contemplated
that
aliens
should
have
an
opportunity
to
have
one
bite
at
the
apple
in
court
to
determine
whether
their
legalization
application
was
improperly
denied.
and
it
determined
to
consolidate
that
judicial
review
with
the
judicial
review
of
a
deportation
order,
which
would
mean
that
the
courts
look
at
that
particular
alien's
case
on
one
occasion,
not
on
one
channel
to
review
the
legalization
denial
and
then
a
separate
channel
to
review
the
deportation
order.
congress
was
well
aware
when
it
crafted
this
system
that
aliens
who
were
illegally
in
the
country
have
ample
incentives
and
have
demonstrated
a
proclivity
for
taking
advantage
of
the
legal
process.
and
so
it
wanted
a
system
that
would
provide
this
fair
opportunity
for
review,
but
not
until
the
alien
who
was
illegally
in
the
country
was
actually
confronted
with
an
order
directing
him
to
leave.
and
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
an
immigration
program
such
as
this,
where
congress
is
essentially
legalizing
millions
of
people
who
entered
the
country
illegally,
who
have
no
status
as
citizens
in
the
united
states,
and
who
are
being
given
an
opportunity
essentially
to
leap
ahead
of
the...
the
waiting
list
of
people
who
would
like
to
become
citizens,
and
become
permanent
residents
and
then
citizens,
it
should
be
allowed
to
craft
a
judicial
system
which
is
both
fair
and
at
the
same
time
streamlined
enough
to
avoid
various
burdens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
our
case
would
not
be
as
strong
if
congress
had
not
introduced
this
framework
for
judicial
review
with
the
preclusion
provision.
but
it
is
standard
administrative
law
practice
to
review
the
validity
of
rules
governing
benefits
programs
when
an
individual
is
confronted
with
a
determination
on
his
particular
claim.
so
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
strong
argument
that
even
if
the
preclusion
provision
had
not
been
put
in,
the
fact
that
congress
contemplated
judicial
review
only
at
the
point
in
which
a
deportation
order
was
entered
would
require
the
courts
to
direct
judicial
review
to
that
point,
in
which
an
alien
can
raise
the
very
claims
that
were
raised
in
this
case.
an
alien
can
argue
that
his
due
process
rights
were
denied.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
heckler
v.
ringer
case
presents
a
very
analogous
situation.
there
people
wanted
to
challenge
a
regulation
governing
eligibility
for
benefits
in
the
medicare
program.
they
attempted
to
bring
a
lawsuit
before
they
had
completed
the
administrative
process.
three
of
the
people
involved
in
that
case
had
submitted
claims
and
were
afraid
that
their
claims
would
be
denied.
one
of
the
people
in
that
case
had
not
even
submitted
a
claim.
and
this
court
held
that
the
provisions
governing
judicial
review
in
the
medicare
act
required
that
the
claim
about
the
validity
of
the
rule
be
raised
in
the
context
of
challenging
a
particular
denial
of
benefits.
and
that
is
a
standard
administrative
law
way
of
deciding
the
validity
of
rules.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
michigan
academy
represents
a
distinctive
situation,
precisely
because
it
did
raise
the
question
you
alluded
to
about
the
possible
preclusion
of
all
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
claim.
there
a
different
aspect
of
the
medicare
act
was
involved
in
which
congress
had
precluded
judicial
review
of
particular
benefits
denials.
and
this
court
in
united
states
v.
erika
had
upheld
that
preclusion.
the
next
case
down
the
line
was
michigan
academy,
which
challenged
a
rule
that
was
used
to
decide
the
validity
of
many
benefits
claims.
the
court
was
deeply
troubled
by
the
idea
that
there
would
be
no
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
or
claim
that
the
regulation
departed
from
the
statute,
and
it
therefore
read
the
language
of
that
statute
to
leave
open
the
possibility
of
judicial
review
of
rules
alone.
the
language
of
that
statute
had
some
similarities
to
this
statute,
but
it
has
many
differences.
i
think
the
most
notable
difference
is
that
this
statute
is
clearly
structured
to
channel
all
judicial
review
up
to
one
occasion,
the
opportunity
for
judicial
review
when
a
deportation
order
is
entered.
this
statute
has
no
indication
that
it
contemplates
any
other
form
of
judicial
review
of
determinations
respecting
legalization
applications.
second,
the
language
that
was
construed
in
the
michigan
academy
case
is
somewhat
different
from
the
language
that
is
at
issue
here.
the
language
that
is
at
issue
here
covers
determinations
respecting
applications.
the
language
that
was
at
issue
in
michigan
academy
spoke
of
determinations
of
the
amount
of
benefits.
and
i
think
in
that
context,
given
the
very
strong
concerns
that
would
be
raised
if
all
judicial
review
was
precluded,
the
court
read
that
language
to
leave
open
a
challenge
to
rules.
but
there
is
no
such
necessity
here,
and
indeed
to
recognize
that
kind
of
collateral
action
would
disserve
the
important
purposes
that
congress
had
in
limiting
judicial
review.
as
i
said,
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
remedies
were
exhausted
through
the
administrative
process
so
that
the
ins
would
have
the
opportunity
to
formulate
its
policy
to
act
on
particular
cases
and
determine
whether
an
alien
would
be
disqualified
from
the
benefits
he
sought
on
other
grounds,
wholly
apart
from
his
constitutional
challenge.
that
makes
some
cases
drop
out
of
the
process
before
they
ever
get
to
the
courts.
here
the
district
court
was
operating
more
or
less
in
a
vacuum,
and
it
ordered
the
reopening
of
20,000
applications
that
had
been
denied
by
the
ins,
and
ordered
that
they
be
readjudicated
if
the
ins
determined
that
one
of
these
allegedly
unlawful
patterns
or
policies
had
been
applied
to
those
particular--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
not
sure
of
the
exact
status
of
the
17
plaintiffs,
justice
scalia.
my
understanding
is
that,
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
court,
ins
has
identified
all
of
the
people
who
need
to
have
second
interviews
and
has
offered
them
the
opportunity
to
have
second
interviews.
it
has
also
granted--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--those
procedures
will
be
applied.
i
don't
think
the
interviews
have
occurred
yet.
there
also
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
do
not
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
some
of
the
17
plaintiffs
may
have
had
their
saw
status,
their
special
agricultural
worker
status
granted
to
them,
because
the
ins
reviewed
certain
applications
and
it
determined
that
it
was
not
able
to
carry
its
burden
of
proof,
to
show
fraud,
or
whatever,
and
it
granted
the
applications.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
just
not
sure
of
whether
all
of
the
17
plaintiffs
have
been
through
the
process
and
completed
it
at
this
stage.
i
can
find
out
that
information.
the
plaintiffs
did
represent
a
class,
and
it
is
fairly
common
in
class
actions
of
this
kind
to
allow
substitution
of
plaintiffs
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
case
stays
alive.
we
believe
that
there
is
an
important
interest
that
the
government
has
in
establishing
that
we
are
not
under
the
obligation
to
hire
translators
to
provide
translation
at
any
interviews
that
we
conduct.
the
due
process
claims
here,
which
we
did
not
challenge
in
this
case,
relate
to
particular
kinds
of
procedures
that
occur
in
particular
benefits
determinations.
the
plaintiffs
were
asking
for
interpreters.
they
were
asking
for
the
opportunity
to
present
live
witnesses.
they
were
asking
that
a
comprehensive
record
be
made
of
what
happens
at
the
interview.
these
are
claims
that
arose
directly
out
of
things
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
say
they
experienced.
one
or
more
of
the
plaintiffs
experienced
each
one
of
these
things.
in
our
view
those
kinds
of
claims
cannot
be
construed
as
anything
other
than
an
attack
on
the
determinations
respecting
their
applications,
the
very
activity
that
is
covered
by
the
preclusion
provision
in
section
1160(e)
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
wait
for
the
opportunity
to
get
judicial
review
as
congress
provided.
they
simply--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
it
would
depend.
the
way
that
the
ins
has
handled
these
kinds
of
issues
to
date,
and
there
hasn't
been
a
lot
of
experience
with
it,
is
to
consider
what
legal
issue
is
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals,
whether
further
review
will
be
sought
of
that
issue.
and
if
no
further
review
will
be
sought
of
it,
the
ins
has
undertaken
in
at
least
one
instance
to
reopen
applications
and
consider
whether
hearings
need
to
be
given.
now
it
did
that
with
respect
to
a
legal
issue
that
was
decided
in
the
fifth
circuit.
whether
it
would
have
decided
to
do
that
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
know.
ins
may
have
concluded
that
these
kinds
of
challenges--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
they
might--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
may
have
conducted
a
more
abbreviated
review
to
determine
precisely
on
what
grounds
the
aliens
had
been
denied.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
many
of
the
aliens,
and
the
class
itself,
were
not
required
to
exhaust
the
administrative
process.
so
we
don't
have
here
decisions
by
the
legalization
appeals
unit
saying
this
alien
doesn't
qualify
because
he
failed
to
submit
a
medical
exam,
or
his
fingerprints
analysis
didn't
check,
or
he
was
found
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
which
rendered
him
excludable.
these
would
all
be
grounds
that
would,
totally
apart
from
the
alleged
constitutional
violations
in
this
case,
would
disqualify
the
alien
from
the
benefit
that
he
sought.
and
if
you
have
that
kind
of
a
record
in
a
proceeding
it
substantially
narrows
the
category
of
people
who
might
be
eligible
for
the
benefit
that
the
district
court
ordered
across
the
board
in
this
case.
these--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
exactly.
and
that
is
what
you
learn
if
you
go
through
the
administrative
process
as
congress
contemplated.
i
think
another
one
of
the
major
problems
that
we
have
encountered
in
these
kinds
of
legalization
cases
is
that
district
courts
do
not
simply
review
an
isolated
question
of
law
in
the
abstract,
such
as
should
the
ins
be
paying
for
translators
for
these
people.
the
district
courts
become
inevitably
enmeshed
in
administering
the
details
of
the
program,
really
at
the
expense
of
ins'
ability
to
administer
the
program.
we
have
had
district
courts
that
have
enjoined
the
ins
from
enforcing
regulations,
and
have
then
entertained
contempt
motions
when
the
legalization
appeals
unit
applies
that
regulation
in
a
way
that
the
court
thought
was
covered
by
its
prior
order.
so
what
we
have
is
direct
collateral
review
going
straight
out
from
the
administrative
process
to
district
courts
in
contempt
proceedings
about
the
ins'
performance
of
its
obligations.
that
is
clearly
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
wanted
to
impress
finality
requirements
on
the
legalization
program,
and
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
aliens
were
not
simply
running
off
to
the
court
every
time
they
complained
about
some
particular
procedure.
the
pattern
of
practice
theory
that
was
used
in
this
case
really
is
broad
enough
to
allow
any
alien
who
doesn't
like
a
legal
ruling,
or
a
ruling
that
he
can
characterize
as
a
legal
ruling,
to
go
to
court
and
say
a
pattern
or
a
policy
was
applied
to
me
and
my
application
was
denied.
this
is
a
collateral
issue.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
wait
about
the
finality
require...
wait
for
the
finality
requirements
in
the
statute,
it
can
order
the
ins
to
reopen
my
application
today.
now,
that
theory
is
not
limited
to
class
actions.
it
would
equally
apply
to
any
individual
who
claimed
that
he
had
a
legal
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
motivation
would
be
that
the
individual
alien
would
like
to
have
his
denial
reversed
or
his
application
readjudicated
without
having
to
go
through
the
system
that
congress
intended,
which
does
impose
some
more
time
elapsing
before
the
alien
can
get
it.
and
it
is
not
just
a
pattern
or
policy.
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
the
eleventh
circuit's
test
that
makes
clear
when
you
have
a
pattern
or
policy
that
is
susceptible
to
challenge.
if
the
ins
had
a
rule
that
said
no
translators
will
be
paid
for,
that
would
seem
to
qualify
under
the
eleventh
circuit's
test
for
a
discrete
legal
issue
that
could
be
snipped
off
from
the
rest
of
the
case
and
challenged
in
a
piecemeal
fashion
in
district
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
reasoning
is
the
somewhat
arbitrary
sense
that
if
a
problem
is
affecting
a
large
category
of
people
the
district
court
ought
to
hear
about
it,
and
if
it
is
only
a
procedural
error
affecting
one
individual
then
we
ought
to
leave
it
for
the
statutory
review
process.
i
don't
think
there
is
an
intelligible
line
that
can
be
drawn.
there
are
two
eleventh
circuit
decisions...
one
eleventh
circuit,
one
fifth
circuit
decision...
that
preceded
this
case
that
were
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
reasoning
in
those
cases
seems
to
be
simply
that
there
is
a
widespread
problem
going
on
here.
a
federal
district
court
needs
to
get
involved
because
it
would
be
more
efficient
and
wise
to
hear
it
that
way.
none
of
those
cases
analyzed
the
language
of
the
statute
or
explained
why
claims
that
could
be
raised
in
the
sole
forum
for
review
of
those
claims,
namely
the
court
of
appeals,
should
also
be
entertained
on
the
district
court
simply
because
they
affect
a
lot
of
different
people.
i
think
it's
just
a
judicial
judgment
that
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
do
it
this
way,
but
that
was
not
congress'
judgment.
congress'
judgment
was
to
keep
a
case
by
case
system
in
place
in
order
to
provide
various
benefits
and
in
order
to
keep
the
district
courts
out
of
running
the
ins
in
effect.
now
there
is
another
set
of
respondents
here
besides
the
individual
respondents,
who
i
think
all
were
clearly
challenging
some
determination
respecting
their
application.
the
other
set
of
respondents
are
organizational
plaintiffs.
one
of
them
was
a
qualified
designated
entity
which
was
designated
under
the
statute
to
accept
applications
and
to
serve
as
something
of
an
intermediary
between
the
ins
and
the
aliens.
the
second
organization
didn't
have
that
status,
it
was
simply
a
membership
organization
that
gives
legal
advice
to
haitian
aliens.
those
two
organizations
contend
that
they
can
come
into
court
free
from
any
exhaustion
requirements
and
free
from
any
restrictions
of
the
statute
because
they
could
never
have
a
deportation
or
exclusion
order
against
them,
and
they
therefore
have
to
have
a
forum
to
address
the
harms
that
they
claim
have
befallen
them
in
this
program.
we
think
that
that
argument
would
completely
undermine
the
careful
scheme
for
judicial
review
that
congress
prescribed
for
individual
aliens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
standing
for
the
organizational
plaintiffs.
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
reasoned
that
they
had
suffered
an
injury
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
havens
realty,
therefore
they
had
article
iii
standing,
and
the
court
never
stopped
to
analyze
whether
allowing
the
organizations
to
bring
suit
would
have
any
effect
of
disrupting
the
rest
of
the
statutory
scheme.
we
think
for
several
reasons
that
the
organizations
cannot
be
permitted
to
circumvent
the
scheme
for
review
that
congress
provided.
first,
the
language
that
precludes
judicial
review
of
determinations
respecting
an
application
applies
to
any
claim.
it
doesn't
apply
only
to
claims
that
were
made
by
individual
aliens.
these
claims
that
are
made
here
by
the
organizations
are
identical
in
legal
substance
to
the
claims
that
are
made
by
the
individuals,
and
they
are
subject
to
the
same
bar.
second,
it
would
be
most
anomalous
to
read
the
statute
to
allow
the
people
who
are
more
remotely
injured,
these
organizations,
to
have
a
superior
vehicle
to
present
their
claims,
that
did
not
require
exhaustion,
and
that
did
not
allow
the
agency
to
complete
its
formulation
of
policy.
all
of
the
legal
claims
that
are
asserted
by
the
organizations
hinge
on
due
process
rights
of
individual
aliens.
they
really
are
asserting
a
third-party
standing
theory
in
order
to
bring
these
kinds
of
claims.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
could
have
been
preserved
at
the
administrative
level.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
on
a...
the
constitutional
claims
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
ins
to
resolve.
in
this
particular
case
each
one
of
the
constitutional
claims
had
a
parallel
statutory
claim.
the
plaintiffs
contended
that
they
could
have
gotten
relief
right
under
the
statute.
that
the
ins
legalization
appeals
unit
could
have
addressed.
the
constitutional
claim,
i
think,
would
have
had
to
be
preserved
by
the
individuals
and
then
presented
to
a
court
of
appeals,
and
a
court
of
appeals
could
have
adjudicated
it.
if
it
felt
that
it
needed
amplification
of
the
record,
the
statute
gives
it
the
power,
the
tools
to
accomplish
that
goal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
haven't
challenged
that
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it...
well,
i
think
for
purposes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
right,
but
it's
not
a
case
where
congress
had
precluded
review.
it
is
simply
a
unique
context
in
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
appears
to
give
them
something
of
an
entitlement
interest.
this
court
has
never
actually
ruled
that
applicants
for
a
benefit
can
claim
a
property
or
liberty
interest
in
it,
and
we
haven't
presented
that
question
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
souter,
it
could
happen
in
two
ways.
first,
an
alien
could
simply
try
to
vanish
back
into
the
underworld
and
then
he
would
have
to
wait
until
he
was
apprehended.
that
could
take
quite
a
while.
i
mean,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
aliens
are
not
apprehended.
if
an
alien
wants
judicial
review
and
comes
to
the
ins
and
says
i'd
like
to
be
put
in
proceedings
for
the
purpose
of
testing
this
denial,
i
think
that
could
be
accomplished
within
a
year
to
a
year
and
a
half
in
the
ordinary
process.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
injury...
the
only
injury
that
he
can
really
complain
of
is
the
actual
denial
of
his
application,
and
congress
determined,
not
just
for
pattern
or
practice
plaintiffs
but
for
all
participants
in
this
legalization
program,
to
limit
the
opportunity
for
judicial
review.
and
to
hold
to
the
contrary
that
congress
cannot
do
this
would
effectively
mean
that
congress
was
obligated
to
not
only
allow
3.1
million
illegal
aliens
to
obtain
legalized
status,
but
to
allow
anybody
who
was
disappointed
with
the
result
immediately
to
go
to
court.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
are
speculating
about
the
adequacy
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
forum
to
entertain
the
due
process
claims
in
this
case.
that
speculation
should
be
rejected.
the
respondents
have
an
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
the
procedures
that
are
provided
under
the
hobbs
act
and
under
other
procedures,
and
those
claims
can
be
adjudicated
within
the
forum
that
congress
provided.
i'd
like
to
answer
justice
scalia's
concern
about
whether
there
is
a
due
process
interest
in
saw
status
separate
from
the
deportation
itself.
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
due
process
interest
is
best
conceptualized
as
having
the
saw
program
provide
a
defense
to
deportation.
congress
intended
that
saw
applicants
could
apply
for
saw
status
and
legalize
themselves,
but
the
full
machinery
of
the
process
was
not
brought
into
play--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
those
benefits
do
come
with
being
granted
saw
status,
but
an
alien
who
wishes
to
challenge
the
denial
of
saw
status,
which
congress
was
intend...
could
presume
was
an
administratively
correct
denial,
could
seek
work
authorization
as
a
matter
of
discretion
from
the
ins
and
could
get
judicial
review
if
ins
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
that
work
authorization
to
the
alien.
there
is
a
remedy.
thank
you.
