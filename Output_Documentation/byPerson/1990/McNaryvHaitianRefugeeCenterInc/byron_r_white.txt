justice
white
mr.
dreeben,
do
you...
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
that
all
of
the
claims
that
these
plaintiffs
have
could
have
been
presented
at
the
administrative
level?
justice
white
they
couldn't...
they
could
not
then
have
been
dealt
with
at
the
administrative
level?
justice
white
unless
they
could
have
been
remedied
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
justice
white
well,
suppose
they
could
have
been.
