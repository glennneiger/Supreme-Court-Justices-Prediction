justice
kennedy
well,
i
thought
in
spaziano
we
held
that
the
tedder
standard
was
constitutional.
justice
kennedy
would
the
florida
court
have
been
entitled
in
its
discretion
to
hear
this
claim
on
rehearing?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
court
just
says
denied
for
failure...
because
of
failure
to
comply
with
our
rules
that
the
claim
must
be
presented?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
say
held
hostage,
that's
all
they
need
to
add.
