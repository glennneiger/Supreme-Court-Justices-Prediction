mr.
robert
j.
link
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
four
issues
before
the
court
in
our
briefs.
if
we
don't
get
to
talk
about
all
of
them,
we
will
rely
upon
the
arguments
that
are
in
the
briefs.
the
first
issue
involves
the
death
penalty,
the
death
sentence
that
was
imposed.
mr.
parker
was
charged
with
three
counts
of
first-degree
murder
in
jacksonville
in
florida.
the
jury
at
his
trial
found
him
guilty
as
charged
of
two
of
the
three
counts
of
first-degree
murder.
after
receiving
additional
mitigating
evidence
in
a
penalty
phase
trial,
they
recommended
life
sentences
for
both
murders.
they
filled
out
a
specific
verdict
form
in
which
they
found
that
mitigating
circumstances
outweighed
aggravating
circumstances.
the
trial
judge
overruled
their
recommendation
as
to
one
of
the
murders
and
sentenced
mr.
parker
to
death.
he
found
that
there
were
six
aggravating
circumstances,
no
mitigating
circumstances,
despite
the
jury
finding
that
mitigation
outweighed
aggravation
and
despite
uncontroverted
mitigating
evidence
that
was
in
the
record.
the
florida
supreme
court--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--he
stated
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
that
outweighed
the
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
robert
j.
link
the
trial
court
judge
and
the
florida
supreme
court
so
found
that
his...
found
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances.
the--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes,
sir,
and
he
found
no
mitigating
circumstances
at
all
in
his
sentencing
order.
the
sentencing
order
tracks
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
under
florida
law.
there
are
seven
of
them.
the
trial
court
judge
however,
during
argument...
excuse
me...
during
the
penalty
phase
trial,
provided
the
jury
with
an
instruction
that
there
were
additional
mitigating
circumstances;
that
is,
he
told
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
any
aspect
of
the
defendant's
character
or
record
or
any
other
aspect
of
or
circumstances
of
the
offense.
mr.
robert
j.
link
the
trial
judge--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--i
don't
think
we
could
say
that
because
of
the
fact
that
he
went
through
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
and
discussed
them
at
great
length
and
made
absolutely
no
mention
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
even
though
he
had
instructed
the
jury
on
the
mitigating
circumstances
as,
as
an
eighth
mitigating...
statutory
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
but
he
made
no
mention
of
any
analysis
of
those
mitigating
circumstances
in
his
sentencing
order,
while
he
did
as
to
the
statutory
mitigators.
in
the
florida
supreme
court's
analysis
such
as
it
was,
was
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
found
by
the
trial
court
judge.
that
was
the
florida
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
the
trial
judge's
order
and
that
is...
was
also
the
united
states
district
court
judge's
interpretation
of
the
trial
judge's
order.
that's
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said.
he
found
no
mitigating
circumstances.
i
think
that's
pretty
much
dispositive
as
to
what
occurred
there.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
however,
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
as
the
florida
supreme
court
later
said,
they
were
not
requiring
state
court
judges
or
juries
to
consider
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
they
were
using
a
mere
presentation
standard
which
meant
that
as
long
as
we
let
them
hear
about
it,
there's
no
problem.
they
don't
have
to
really
consider
it.
after
this
court's
decision
in
hitchcock
in
1987,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
acted
to
correct
that
problem.
mr.
robert
j.
link
i
stand
corrected.
the
statute
did
not
require
it.
the
law
required
it
as
interpreted
under,
under
lockett--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
the
issue
as
to
the
death
sentence
in
this
case
is
whether
the
standards
used
by
the
florida
supreme
court
to
approve
jury
overrides
are
subject
to
eighth
amendment
review.
the
state's
position
is
and
has
been
that
once
an
override
is
affirmed
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
becomes
a
matter
of
state
law
and
that
it
is
insulated
from
federal
review.
that's
the
be
all
and
end
all.
our
position
is
that
the
state
cannot
develop
a
constitutional
procedure
to
safeguard
against
the
arbitrary
application
of
the
death
penalty
and
then
refuse
to
use
it
in
an
individual
case.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
just
because
they
did
not
have
to
give
a
jury
recommendation
any
weight
at
all,
once
the...
once
it
is
established,
that
is,
they
have
established
a
constitutional
procedure
which
this
court
has
approved--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--i
would
say
a
constitutional
procedure
in
death
penalty
parlance
is
one
that
has
been
approved
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
link
it
is...
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
required.
it
is
permitted
by
the
constitution.
yes,
sir.
but
once
the
state
establishes
that
procedure,
they
have
to
follow
it.
in
other
words,
they
can't
develop
one
set
of
rules
for
everybody
else
in
jury
overrides
and
distinguish
against
robert
parker.
mr.
robert
j.
link
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
found
in
godfrey
v.
georgia.
we
feel
that
that
is
exactly
the
principle
that
godfrey
stands
for.
in
other
words,
once
the
state
establishes
a
constitutional...
or
a
construction
of
a
standard
for
imposing
the
death
penalty,
they
cannot
then
refuse
to
apply
it
in
an
individual
case.
that's
what
happened
in
godfrey
v.
georgia.
the
state
had
developed
a
constitutional
construction
of
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
but
in
godfrey's
case
they
did
not
utilize
that
statutory
construction,
that
constitutional
construction,
in
judging
his
case.
and
that
was
the
error
that
permitted
the
arbitrary
application
of
the
death
penalty
in
that
instance.
so
we
feel
that
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
tedder
standard
under
florida
law
is
that
a
trial
judge
must
give
a
jury
recommendation
great
weight
and
can
overrule
it
only
if
the
facts
suggesting
a
sentence
of
death
are
so
clear
and
convincing
that
virtually
no
reasonable
person
could
differ.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
apply
their
construction
or
standard
of
review
for
reviewing
overrides
in
this
case.
their
standard
for
reviewing
overrides
is
the
reasonable
basis
test
which
was
developed
in
the
case
of
malloy,
richardson
and
numerous
other
cases
cited
in
the
briefs.
the
reasonable
basis
test
for
reviewing
jury
overrides
requires
a,
an
appellate
court
to
review
the
record
and
examine
the
record
even
if
the
judge
finds
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
see
if
there
are
any
factors
that
could
have
formed
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
juries
recommendation.
there
is
no
presumption
that
death
is
appropriate
even
if
the
judge
finds
numerous
aggravating
factors
and
no
mitigating
factors.
when
there's
a
life
recommendation,
there's
no
presumption
that
death
is
appropriate.
the
job
of
the
appellate
court,
according
to
florida
supreme
court
decisions,
is
to
look
for
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
recommendation.
if
there
is
one,
then
the
life
recommendation
should
stand.
this
is
the
standard
that
was
not
applied
here.
mr.
robert
j.
link
no,
your
honor,
we're
not.
mr.
robert
j.
link
we
are
asking
this
court
to
require
the
florida
supreme
court
to
apply
that
standard.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
second-guess
it
or
to
say
that--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--no,
sir,
because
the,
the
court
told
us
what
it
did
here.
they
told
us
in
the
opinion
that
they
did
not
use
a
reasonable
basis
test.
they
told
us
what
the
basis
of
affirming
the
override
was.
their
entire
discussion
relating
to
the
override
was
that
the
trial
court
found
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
balance
against
the
aggravating
circumstances,
of
which
four
were
properly
applied.
in
light
of
these
findings,
the
facts
suggesting
a
sentence
of
death
are
so
clear
and
convincing
that
virtually
no
reasonable
person
could
differ.
they
based
their
entire
decision
in
this
case
on
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
found
no
mitigating
circumstances.
that's
it.
they
didn't
go
beyond
that.
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
analysis
performed
in
this
case.
they...
we
know
that
because
they
tell
us.
they
tell
us
right
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
what
they
based
their
decision
on
and
it
is
a
basis
that
was
virtually
unprecedented
and
it
certainly
is
contrary
to
what
they've
done
in
virtually
every
other
case
involving
jury
overrides.
mr.
robert
j.
link
in...
yes,
sir...
thank
you.
in
the
lewis
v.
jeffers
case,
it
involved
a
standard
of
review
that
was
constitutional
on
its
face
and
the
state
court
said
that
it
applied
that
standard
within
the
body
of
its
opinion.
the
mere
fact
that
this
court
might
disagree
with
the
application
of
that
standard
is
not
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
we
would
agree
with
that
decision.
the
situation
here
is
that
the
court,
that
is,
the
florida
supreme
court,
has
created
a
standard
for
reviewing
jury
overrides
but
did
not
apply
it
in
this
case.
they
don't
say
they
don't
apply
it.
in
other
words,
they
said
we
have
performed
a
reasonable
basis
analysis.
we
have
examined
the
record.
we
have
found
no
reasonable
basis
for
determining
that
the
jury...
that
there
was
a...
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
jury
override.
if
that
was
what
they
found
in
the
body
of
the
opinion,
then
we
would
be
in
the
lewis
v.
jeffers
category.
we
are
not.
we
are
more...
we
are
in
the
godfrey
v.
georgia
category
where
the
court
has
a
standard
but
refuses
to
apply
it
to
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
link
that
is
correct.
we
would
be...
the
only
argument
that
we
would
have
would
be
that
there
would
be
the
jackson
v.
virginia
rational
tryer
effect
argument
that
was
presented
in
lewis
v.
jeffers.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
link
i
think
we
have
to
assume
they
did
not
where
in
this
case
they
said
they
did
not.
they
told
us...
they
tell
us
the
basis
for
their
decision--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--i
don't
believe
so,
because
they
say
in
light
of
these
findings,
referring
to
the
trial
court's
findings.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir,
that,
that
was--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir,
they
did
do
that
in
reference
to
any
issues
to
award
a
new
trial.
that
was
as
to
the
guilt
phase.
they
present
no
discussion
or
no
indication
that
they
have
evaluated
the
record
to
see
if
there
is
any...
there
are
any
mitigating
circumstances--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes,
sir.
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
says
it
goes
to
the
sentencing
phase.
it
simply
says,
accordingly,
after
having
done
this
review,
the
convictions
are
affirmed.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
the
florida
supreme
court
recognized
that
its
application
of
the
tedder
standard
was...
i
described
as
aberrational.
i
think
they
recognize
it
as
just,
as
being
just
that.
during
1984
and
1985,
they
were
affirming
overrides
at
a
rate
of
73
percent
during
that
time.
the
following
years
the
affirmant's
rate
has
been
in
the
vicinity
of
20
percent.
mr.
robert
j.
link
i
think
for
any...
every
general
principle
one
can
say
about
the
florida
supreme
court
one
can
find
exceptions
and
i,
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
the
florida
supreme
court
did
rely
on
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
prior
to
1984
and
1985.
however,
the
court
subsequently
admitted
that
they
were
not
giving
considerations
necessarily
to
nonstatutory
mitigation
in
the
case
of
downs
v.
dugger
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
so
during
this
time
frame,
it
was
certainly
a
skewed
type
of
analysis
that
was
being
performed
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
it
seemed
that
they
occasionally
did
give
weight
to
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
and
in
other
instances
did
not.
for
example,
we
can
find
in
prior
florida
precedent
authority
for
the
propositions
that
virtually
all
of
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
evidence
that
was
present
in
this
case
was
in
other
cases
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
reasonable...
a
sufficiently
reasonable
basis
for
a
jury
life
recommendation.
intoxication
was
recognized
as
a
nonstatutory
mitigating
factor
that
could
support
a
jury
life
recommendation
before
this
case
and
after
this
case.
sentences
of
codefendants
was
recognized--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes.
mr.
robert
j.
link
they
get
overridden...
i
think
it
depends
on...
it
goes
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
but
with
some
frequency.
about
one
third
of
the
death
sentences
imposed
in
florida
have
been
jury
overrides.
the
vast
majority
have
been
set
aside
by
the
florida
supreme
court
using
the
reasonable
basis
analysis.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir.
this,
this
court
has
already
reviewed
two
prior
overrides,
by
this
same
judge
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
barclay
and
dobbert
v.
florida.
mr.
robert
j.
link
spaziano
was,
was
not
this
judge.
mr.
robert
j.
link
no,
sir.
our
contention
very
briefly
there
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
did
in
this
case
what
godfrey
says
that
it
can't
do.
the
state
can't
develop
a
procedure
that
safeguards
against
arbitrary
application
of
the
death
penalty,
then
refuse
to
follow
it.
our
contention
very
simply
is
that
robert
parker
is
entitled
to
the
same
procedural
protections
that...
as
other
defendants
in
jury
override
cases,
and
he
didn't
get
it
in
this
case.
we're
simply
asking...
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
second-guess
the
florida
supreme
court.
there
is
no
necessity
for
this
court
to
substitute
your
judgment
for
theirs.
we
know
based
on
the
opinion
that
they
didn't
do
what
they
say
they
do
in
other
cases.
we're
not...
we
are
asking
the
court
to
send
this
case
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
asking--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--i
think
the,
the
question
somewhat
melds
here
when
one
talks
about...
in
terms
of
eighth
amendment
arbitrariness.
but
it
is
the,
the
aberrational
application
or
failure
to
apply
that
standard
that
i
think
results
in
the
arbitrariness
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
because
the
phrase
on
its
face
was
unconstitutional;
as
construed
by
the
state
supreme
court
it
was
constitutional.
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
the
tedder
standard,
it
in
fact
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face;
that
is,
the
standard
of
facts
suggesting
a
sentence
of
death
must
be
so
clear
and
convincing
that
no
reasonable
person
could
differ.
that
could
mean
on
its
face
virtually
anything.
it
is
a
sort
of
a
stand
back
and
react
type
of
test
that
this
court
condemned
in
maynard
v.
cartwright.
mr.
robert
j.
link
when
this
court...
i
don't
think
so
and
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
so.
this
court
cited
the
richardson
case,
which
talks
about
the
way
the
supreme
court
reviews
and
has
construed
the
tedder
standard.
and
we
feel
that
the
richardson
construction
is
a
constitutional
construction
of
the
tedder
standard.
in
other
words,
as
construed
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
their
reasonable
basis
analysis
is
a
constitutional
construction,
because--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--my
understanding
was
that
it
was
constitutional
as
applied,
as
construed
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
tedder
standard
on
its
face
doesn't
do
anything
to
channel
discretion.
it
is...
appears
to
be
a
gut
reaction
type
of
test
where
one
looks
at
everything,
the
overall
facts
and
circumstances
and
says,
we
don't
like
it,
let's
kill
it.
that's
what...
it's
the
open-ended,
unchannelled
discretion
that
this
court
said
it
was
improper
in
furman
and
maynard
and
virtually
every
case
since
then.
with
a...
we
have
a
constitutional
construction
of
the
tedder
standard
is
the
reasonable
basis
analysis
that
requires
some
analysis
of
mitigating
circumstances
and
channels
the
discretion.
the
tedder
standard
on
its
face
also
makes
no
allowance
for
mitigating
circumstances,
in
fact.
it
simply
states
that
the
facts
suggesting
a
sentence
of
death
must
be
so
clear
and
convincing
that
no
reasonable
person
could
differ...
or
about
mitigation.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir,
we
have
several
others.
there
were
jury
instructions
in
this
case
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
could
find
the
defendant
guilty
under
one
of
two
theories,
that
is,
felony
murder
or
premeditated
murder,
the
underlying
felony
being
robbery.
the
evidence
of
robbery
was
held
to
be
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
florida
supreme
court
subsequently.
so
the
jury
was
instructed
on
theory
of
liability
that
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
but
not
only
were
they
instructed
on
a
theory
of
liability
that
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
they
were
also
told
that
mr.
parker's
defense
to
that
theory
of
liability,
which
was
supported
by
the
evidence,
was
not
a
defense
at
all.
mr.
parker
testified
on
his
own
behalf
and
explained
to
the
jury
that
he
was
present
at
the
scene
of
the
sheppard
homicide
but
that
he
did
not
participate
voluntarily,
that
he
was
threatened
by
tommy
groover,
who
was
armed
and
he
was
not,
and
his
wife
had
been
threatened,
and
that
explained
his
presence
there.
duress
was
the
defense
to
the
sheppard
homicide.
the
trial
court
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
duress
was
not
a
defense
to
murder,
period.
this
allowed
the
state
to
argue
that
robert
parker
was
guilty
even
by
his
own
testimony,
even
if
his
own
testimony
was
true.
the
evidence
that
had
been
presented
of
fear
and
coercion
was
essentially...
became
incriminating
and
not
exculpatory.
mr.
robert
j.
link
the
constitutional
principle
is
that
it
denies
due
process
to
preventing
him
from
presenting
his
defense.
in
other
words,
every
man
has
a
right
to
be
heard
and
mr.
parker
was
not
heard.
he
was
not
given
the
right
to
be
heard
in
this
case.
his
defense
was
taken
away
from
him.
the
judge
essentially
directed
a
verdict
of
guilt
by
telling
the
jury
his
defense
wasn't
a
defense.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
link
it
is
a
defense
to
felony
murder.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
defense
to
the
underlying
felon...
whereas
a
defense
to
the
underlying
felony.
it's
well
established--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--no,
sir,
and
that
is...
but
your
honors'
statement
of
facts
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
it
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
robert
parker
killed
no
one.
he
was
an
aider
and
abetter
at
all
times
and
that
was
the
evidence
that
was
presented
at
trial.
the
basis
of
his
liability
in
the
sheppard
murder
was
based
on
the
taking
of
a
necklace
and
ring
from
the
sheppard
girl
after--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes.
mr.
robert
j.
link
the
evidence
under
his
own
testimony
was
that
he
was
present,
did
nothing
to
assist
in
the
murder
but
was
told
to
take
the
ring
and
necklace
afterwards.
so
under
those
circumstances,
the
jury
very
well
could
have
considered
that
he
was
an
involuntary
participant
in
the
robbery.
so
we
think
that--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--that
would
fit
within
the
ambient
of
the
court's
analogy
there.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
link
on
the...
your
honor
means
on
the
direct
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court?
mr.
robert
j.
link
as
to
the
direct
appeal,
the
issue
was
raised
in
response
to
the
florida
supreme
court's
finding
that
the
evidence
to
support
the
robbery
aggravating
circumstance
was
insufficient.
it
was
raised--
mr.
robert
j.
link
--yes.
mr.
robert
j.
link
in
state
court,
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
j.
link
the
answer
is
that
we
felt
that
we
had,
we
had
raised
it
in
both
the
trial
court
and
in
the
state
supreme
court
during
the
direct
appeal
and
that
the,
there
was
no
point
and
in
fact
we
would
precluded
from
raising
it
in
state
postconviction
proceedings.
there
is
a
rule
of
florida
law
that
if
you
raise
something
in
state
postconviction
that
has
been
raised
in
the
trial
court,
it's
automatically
dismissed.
it's
not
proper.
it's
not
valid.
mr.
robert
j.
link
yes,
sir,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
link
please
the
court.
the...
just
so
it's
clear,
the
evidence
of
intoxication
that
was
presented
at
the
trial
court
level
was
uncontroverted
and
it
came
primarily
from
state
witnesses
who
all
said
the
defendant
was
high,
flying,
under
the
influence,
drunk,
stoned,
what
have
you.
so
that
was
uncontroverted.
he
took
lsd,
pcp,
and
drank
3
or
4
cases
of
beer
in
a
4-hour
period,
so
the
evidence
is
pretty
strong
about
intoxication.
mr.
robert
j.
link
that
is
correct;
however,
the
judge...
the
law
requires
the
judge
to
consider
it
and
there's
no
evidence
that
he
did.
particularly
he
knew
enough
to
tell
the
jury
about
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
he
gave
an
instruction
about
it
that
didn't
include
any
language
that
he
had
considered
any
of
those
factors
in
his,
in
his
decision
even
though
he
considered
virtually
all
of
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
even
ones
that
were
not
argued
were
presented
to
the
jury.
i
also
wanted
to
correct
one
thing.
billy
long,
the
actual
trigger
man,
the
one
who
killed
the
sheppard
girl,
was
given
a
plea
bargain
to
second-degree
murder.
he's
already
been
paroled.
he
was
not
given
a
life
sentence.
