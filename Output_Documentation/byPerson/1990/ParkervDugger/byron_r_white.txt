justice
white
what
did
he
have
to
say?
justice
white
well,
that
doesn't
mean
there
aren't...
isn't...
aren't
any
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
white
well,
what...
but
what
did
the...
the
trial
judge
said
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
that
outweigh
the
aggravating?
justice
white
so
is
this
an
eighth
amendment
question
or
equal
protection?
justice
white
the
conclusion
of
the
godfrey
court...
that
was
where
the
court
in
georgia
appeared
not
to
follow
its
rule
that
the
victim
had
to
be
tortured
or,
or
severely
abused.
but
the
conclusion
of
the
georgia
court
or
rather
the
supreme
court,
was
thus
the
validity
of
the
petitioner's
death
sentence
terms
on
whether,
in
light
of
the
circumstances
of
the
murders,
the
georgia
supreme
court
can
be
said
to
have
applied
a
constitutional
construction
of
the
phrase.
then
it
quotes
the
phrase.
and
we
conclude
the
answer
must
be
no.
so
i,
i
don't
see
how
that
supports
your
view
that
we,
we
can
parse
the
record
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
state
law
was
properly
applied.
the
whole
conclusion
of
godfrey
is
there
was
an
unconstitutional
construction
of
the
phrase.
justice
white
is
this...
is
this
your
strongest
argument,
do
you
think?
but
you
have
another
one
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
what's
the
constitutional
principle
here?
justice
white
so
this
is
a
guilt
or
innocence
argument?
justice
white
your
contention
is
that,
that
under
the
state
law,
coercion
or
duress
is
a
defense
to,
to
homicide?
