justice
scalia
you're
in,
in
essence
asking
us
to
review
that
factual
determination
of
the,
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state?
justice
scalia
why
aren't
you?
justice
scalia
well,
we,
we
can't
tell
that
they
haven't
applied
it
without,
without
entering
into
the
factual
inquiry
and,
and
concluding
that
they
were
wrong.
i
mean,
you're
telling
us
that
there's
no
basis
in
the
record
for,
for
their
conclusion,
right?
and
that
therefore
they
couldn't
have
been
acting
the
way
they're
supposed
to.
justice
scalia
so
apparently
they
did
conduct
an
independent
review
of
the
record.
justice
scalia
they
have
said
that.
justice
scalia
you
think
that
does
not
go
to
the
sentencing
phase,
that
statement?
justice
scalia
it
is
a
defense
to
felony
murder?
justice
scalia
as
i
understood
that
to
mean
that
if,
that
if
you
are
coerced
into
a
bank
robbery,
into
participating
in
a
bank
robbery
and
one
of
the
other
participants
kills
a
bank
guard,
duress
is
a
defense,
but
is
there
any
state
case
that
says
if
you're
the
one
that
kills
the
bank
guard?
justice
scalia
an
aider
or
abettor
in
the
murder
itself,
not
just
in
the
bank
robbery
though,
not
just
in
the
robbery.
justice
scalia
he
was
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
murder.
i
mean,
that
was
the
crime
that
he
walked
into,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
that
he
participated
because
of
coercion
and
bank
robbery
and
then
somebody
happened
to
get
killed.
he
didn't
pull
the
trigger
but
he
was
a
participant
in
the,
in
the
act
of
killing
someone.
