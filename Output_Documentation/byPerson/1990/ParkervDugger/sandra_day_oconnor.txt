justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the,
the
trial
judge
didn't
consider
all
the
evidence?
i
thought
the
trial
judge
expressly
found
that
all
the
evidence
was
considered.
justice
o'connor
i
mean
it,
it
would
appear
from
the
language
used
by
the
trial
judge
that
indeed
all
this
other
mitigating
evidence
was,
was
received.
it
was
considered.
it
was
weighed,
but
not
found
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't
both
the
trial
court
and
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
find
or
conclude
that
no
reasonable
person
could
have
failed
to
impose
the
death
sentence
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
is
89-5961,
parker
against
dugger
which
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
we
hold
today
that
the
florida
supreme
court
acted
arbitrarily
in
affirming
parker's
death
sentence
because
it
failed
to
treat
adequately
the
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
record.
the
state
trial
judge
overrode
a
jury's
recommendation
and
sentenced
parker
to
death
finding
six
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
and
no
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
the
trial
judge
made
no
explicit
finding
as
to
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
on
direct
review,
the
florida
supreme
court
struck
two
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
relied
on
by
the
trial
judge.
but,
nonetheless,
upheld
the
death
sentence
based
on
what
it
believed
to
be
the
trial
judge's
conclusion
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances.
upon
a
review
of
the
record,
we
conclude
that
the
trial
judge
must
have
found
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
in
such
a
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
after
striking
two
aggravating
circumstances,
could
have
reweighed
the
evidence
or
it
could
have
conducted
a
harmless
error
analysis.
it
did
neither,
instead,
the
florida
supreme
court
simply
affirmed
the
sentence
based
on
non-existent
trial
court
findings.
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
thereby,
deprived
parker
of
the
individualized
sentencing
to
which
he
is
entitled
under
the
constitution.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
as
to
parker's
remaining
questions
in
his
petition
for
certiorari,
they
are
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
kennedy.
