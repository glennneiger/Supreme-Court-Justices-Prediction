chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-5961,
robert
lacy
parker
v.
richard
l.
dugger.
mr.
link.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
he
just
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
find
these
were
mitigating
circumstances,
not
that
they
had
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
it
didn't
have
to
develop
it
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
they've
established
a
constitutional
procedure,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
constitutional
procedure?
one
that
is
permitted
by
the
constitution
or
one
that
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
don't
answer
my
question.
i
asked
you
whether
you
mean
required
or
permitted
by
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
what's
your
basis...
what
is
the
constitutional
basis
for
that
statement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.,
mr.
link,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
claim
you're
making
from
the
claim
that
the
capital
defendant
in
lewis
against
jeffers
last
term
made,
claiming
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
not
consistently
applied
its
own
capital
sentencing
decisions.
and
we
rejected
that
claim.
we
said
that's
not
a
matter
of
federal
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
link,
isn't
the,
isn't
the
portion
of
the
standard
that
you
claim
they
didn't
apply,
the
standard
that
requires
them
to
make
some
kind
of
an
independent
review
of
the
record
to
determine
whether
they
believe
there
are
mitigating
circumstances?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
we
kind
of
approve
it
in
spaziano?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
link.
ms.
snurkowski,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
snurkowski,
when
you
say
aired
it,
do
you
mean
considered
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
snurkowski.
mr.
link,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
link.
the
case
is
submitted.
