justice
stevens
well,
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
link?
you
said
that
and,
and
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
that
florida
law
required
a
weighing
of
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
against
aggravating
circumstances.
now
the
statute
has
since
1985
required
that,
but
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
it
required
just
the
opposite,
didn't
it?
it
merely
required
that
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
be
weighed.
justice
stevens
under
lockett,
but
the
florida
statute,
one
just
reading
the
florida
statute
and
not
paying
attention
to
lockett
might
not
have
done
it
that
way.
justice
stevens
mr.
link,
you're,
you're
quoting
from
page
71
of
the
joint
appendix,
but
if
you
will
look
on
page
70,
the
florida
supreme
court
before
saying,
the
trial
court
found
no
mitigating
circumstances;
in
light
of
these
findings,
we
think
it's
correct...
on
page
70,
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
court
says,
in
addition
to
considering
all
other
issues
raised
on
appeal,
we
have
conducted
an
independent
review
of
the
record
on
trial
and
find
no
reason
to
award
a
new
trial.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
link,
if
the
florida
supreme
court's
practice
changed
at
all
in
the
period
right
after
1984
and
1985
in
what
they
did
in
these
cases?
justice
stevens
but
not
just
on
statistics
in
view
of
their
legal
approach.
is
it
not
correct
that
prior
to
this...
the
change
in
time,
they
were
not
relying
at
all
on
nonmitigating,
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
in,
in
reviewing
overrides,
whereas
after
that
period
they
did
it
rather
regularly?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
it.
justice
stevens
how
often
are
jury's,
jury
recommendations
overridden
in
florida?
what's
the
history
down
there?
you
said
there's
been
a
change
in
the
percentage,
but
how
often
do
the
jury
recommendations
of,
of
life
get
overridden?
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
you
make
some
point
in
your
brief
about
this
same
judge
was
overridden
a
number...
he's
overridden
a
number
of
jury
verdicts.
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
and
spaziano,
too,
or
was
that--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a...
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
preliminary
questions--
justice
stevens
--on
this,
because
i
have
the
feeling
as
i
read
through
the
papers
that
the...
all
the
reference
to
tedder
just
confuses
the
issue
and
that
what
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
was
hitchcock
error,
that
there
were
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
that
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
the
trial
judge
even
considered.
now
would
you
agree
there
are
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
established
by
the
evidence
here?
justice
stevens
well,
for
example,
the
district
court
relied
on
the
fact
the
defendant
was
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
the
offense
and
that
the
florida
court
has
repeatedly
said
that's
a
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance.
do
you
think
that
was
not
established
by
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
so
you
would
view
the
trial
judge
as
having
rejected
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
evidence
that
he
was
intoxicated?
justice
stevens
and
how
about
the
second
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance
the
district
judge
relied
on,
namely
the
disparity
in
the
sentencing?
justice
stevens
well,
without
getting
into
the
detail,
you
then
agree
with
the
district
judge
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner's
accomplices
and
codefendants
receive
lesser
sentences
for
their
parts
in
the
sheppard
murder.
justice
stevens
but
if
that
is
true
and
if,
as
he
says
by
citing
a
bunch
of
florida
cases,
that
is
regarded
as
a
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance,
how
do
we
know
the
judge
gave
consideration
to
it
or
didn't
give
consideration
to
it?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
it
was
not
a
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance...
there
was
no
such
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance
or
that
he
took
it
into
account
and
weighed
it
against
the
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
stevens
of
course,
he
doesn't
explain
any
of
that,
does
he?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
say
a
word.
he
doesn't
say
a
word
about
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances,
does
he?
justice
stevens
one
other
question...
would
you
agree
that
if
he
did
not
give
consideration
to
nonstatutory
mitigation
circumstances,
that
he
committed
constitutional
error
under
lockett
and
hitchcock?
justice
stevens
well,
if--
justice
stevens
--now
who
has
the
burden
of
establishing
whether
or
not
he
gave
consideration
to
these
nonstatutory
circumstances
that
the
district
court
found
to
have
been
established
by
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
and
they
interpreted...
they
said
he
had
found
no
nonstatutory...
no
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
stevens
no
circumstances
that
needed
to
be
balanced.
justice
stevens
but
if
there
were
any
that
needed
to
be...
if
there
were
any,
they
had
to
be
balanced,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
and
what
does
that
establish?
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
they...
does
that
mean
that
they
agreed
there
were
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances,
but
they
were
clearly
outweighed,
or
were
they
agreeing
with
what
they
said
that
there
were
no
such
circumstances?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
of
course
they
did
just
the
same
thing
in
hitchcock
against
dugger,
did
they?
they
thought
that
was
proper,
too.
justice
stevens
but
they
had...
but
the
opinion...
neither
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge
nor
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
explains
what
weight
if
any
was
given
to
the
evidence
of
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
the
ultimate
conclusion
is
set
forth.
you're
absolutely
right.
but
is
that
sufficient?
justice
stevens
that
30
percent
figure
wasn't
true
during
the
period
1982
to
1984?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
stevens
do...
can
you
reconcile
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
in
this
case
that
the
florida...
that
the
federal
court
of
appeals'
statement
in
their
opinion
that
referring
to
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion
as
saying
that
that
court
had
concluded
that
the
four
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
sufficiently
outweighed
the
mitigating
circumstances
to
justify
the
sentence.
do
you
think
that's
what
the
correct
statement
of
the
florida
supreme
court
held?
justice
stevens
let
me,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand,
because
there
are
two
quite
different
theories
of
what
happened
in
the
state's...
one
is
that
they
found
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances,
so
obviously
they
would
outweigh.
alternatively
they
found
that
there
were
some
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances,
but
that
they
were
outweighed
by
the
aggravating
circumstances.
and
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
say
it
was
the
latter
and
i
would
read
the
florida
supreme
court
as
saying
that
it
was
the
former.
which
do
you
think
if
the
correct
view
of
the
record?
justice
stevens
so
you
presume
that
they
found
some
nonstatutory
circumstances...
mitigating
circumstances
but
found
that
they
were
outweighed
by
the
aggravating?
justice
stevens
but
is
that
because
four
outweighs...
is
greater
than
zero
or
because
four
is
greater
than
two?
justice
stevens
but
is
it...
but
i
still
can't
understand
from
your
answer
whether
you
think
there
were
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
found
by
the
trial
court
or
that
they
were
found
and
found
to
be
outweighed.
justice
stevens
you
can't
tell
from
the
record.
justice
stevens
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
record
disclosed
whether
or
not
he
considered
it,
we
just
presume
he
did.
justice
stevens
no,
it's
not
that
you
and
i
say
yes
or
no,
it's
what...
it's
the
fact
that
the
florida
supreme
court
said
one
thing
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals
said
they
said
something
quite
different
as
a
basis
for
reversing
the
district
court.
that's
what
troubles
me.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
strange
that
when
you
read
his
opinion,
the
trial
judge's
opinion,
he's
in
great
detail
about
each
one
of
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
with
great
elaboration
of
what
the
fact
is.
he
gets
to
the
nonstatutory,
nonstatutory,
he
doesn't
say
a
word
about
it.
justice
stevens
it's
a
rather
dramatic
great
contrast.
justice
stevens
which
is
the
period
when
some
judges
didn't
think
they
had
to
even
look
at
the
nonstatutory.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
law
doesn't
require
the
judge
to
believe
it.
