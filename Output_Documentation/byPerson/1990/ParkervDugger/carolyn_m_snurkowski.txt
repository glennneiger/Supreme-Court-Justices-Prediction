ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
were
five
issues.
we
have
four
issues
presently
before
the
court
today.
most
of
the
time
was
spent
with
regard
to
the
first
issue,
but
i
would
like
to
first
address
the
second
issue
which
was
the
latter
issue
that
was
just
brought
to
the
court's
attention
with
regard
to
whether
in
fact
mr.
link
and
mr.
parker
in
particular
preserve
the
claim
for
which
he
now
asserts
that
review
should
be
granted
or
review
should
be
considered.
first
and
foremost,
with
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
there
were
22
issues
raised
on
direct
appeal,
two
of
which
impact
with
regard
to
this
particular
claim.
one
of
which
was...
had
to
do
with
the
guilt
portion
of
the
trial
and
if
you
recall
in
the
facts
of
this
case
i
have
to
digress
for
a
moment,
there
were
three
murders.
the
first
murder
was
charged
premeditated
murder
but
there
was
also
a
charge...
well,
not
a
charge
but
the
evidence
went
to
a
kidnapping
and
mr.
link,
on
direct
appeal,
argued
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
with
regard
to
the
padgett
murder
to
show
the
underlying
felony
of
kidnapping.
there
was
no,
and
i
repeat,
there
was
no
argument
presented
on
direct
appeal
with
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
raise
the
guilt
as
to
the
nancy
sheppard
murder,
which
was
the
underlying
felony
of
robbery.
so
robbery--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
they
did.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
okay.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
there
were
arguments
not
so
much
as
to
the
sufficiency.
it
was
more
to
the
idea
that
the...
an
instruction...
there
should
not
be
instruction
with
regard
to
that.
it
wasn't
per
se
the
underlying
felony.
the
second
impacted
issue
on
this
which
brings
us
to
the
attention
of
the
robbery
had
to
do
with
the
penalty
phase.
at
the
penalty
phase
mr.
link
argued
that
the
death
penalty
override
was
improper
because
an
aggravating
factor
had
been
improperly
found,
to
wit,
that
the
murder
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
robbery
and
that's
how
the
robbery
became
an
issue
before
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
supreme
court
in
resolving
this
claim
found
that,
yes,
indeed,
it
concurred
that
the
aggravating
factor
was
not
appropriate.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
a
reading
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion
reflects
that
it
was
not
because
the
robbery
was
not
proven
but
rather
there
was
not
a
sufficient
nexus
for
that
underlying
felony
to
support
the
aggravating
factor.
in
florida
with
regard
to
finding
aggravating
factors,
in
particular
the
underlying
felony,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
indicated
that
you
have
to
have
a
nexus
between
a
robbery
that
occurs
and
applying
that
aggravating
factor
to
the
case.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
technically
robbery...
there
was
robbery
in
this
case...
it
was
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
with
regard
to
an
alternative
theory.
in
fact,
though,
the
record
also
reflects
that
the
state
prosecuted
on
premediated
murder
and
very
little
reliance
was
made
with
regard
to
the
underlying
felony
of
robbery
for
the
nancy
sheppard
murder.
the
first
time
this
claim
came
up,
and
it
was
not
raised
in
terms
of
stromberg
but
rather
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
is
in
a
rehearing
petition
after
the
florida
supreme
court
found
and
concurred
that
the
aggravating
factor
was
not
appropriate.
and
that
argument
now
became
a
greater
argument
that
in
fact
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
not
there,
therefore
a
theory
of
liability
for
which
the
defendant
may
have
been
convicted
was
not
supported
by
the
record.
i
would
submit
to
you
first
and
foremost
that
the
opinion
does
not
support
that,
but
more
importantly
raising
something
for
the
first
time
before
the
florida
supreme
court
on
rehearing
does
not
preserve
nor
raise
fairly
the
issue
before
the
state's
highest
court.
the
record
also
reflects
that
collaterally
this
issue
was
not
renewed
or
raised
to
make
sure
it
had
been
preserved.
it
was
not
raised
on
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
state
court
trial
relief
collaterally.
and
the
first
time
it
again
arose
was
when
the
first
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed
in
federal
court.
and
it
was
put
in
the
posture
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
federal
district
court
in
reviewing
this
claim
found
that
there
may
have
been
confusion
with
regard
to
the
eleventh
circuit
as
to
how
it
aired
or
looked
at
issues
that
were
preserved
via
a
rehearing
petition
before
an
appellate
court
on
direct
appeal
and
came
down
on
the
side
that
the
issue
was
not
preserved.
the
court
did
make
some
discussion
with
regard
to
stromberg
and
why
in
fact,
even
if
we
got
to
the
issue,
it
was
not
a
violation
of...
a
constitutional
violation
with
regard
to
mr.
parker.
the
state
stands
before
this
court
as
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
this
particular
claim
was
procedurally
barred
because
the
highest
state
court
had
not
aired
it.
and
they
found
that
this
claim
was
different...
the
posture
in
this
claim--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes.
yes.
i
guess
i
should
use
a
better
word
than
that,
not
air,
your
honor.
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded
that
in
fact
that
the
case
was...
the
issue
was
procedurally
barred
because
in
fact
under
harris
v.
reed
three
members
of
this
court
found
that
when
a
state
court
has
not
been
fairly
given
an
opportunity
to
look
at
a
claim
that
that
issue
can...
you
can't
impose
a
plain
statement
of
the
court.
if
they
don't
have
an
opportunity
you
can't
presume
they're
going
to
know
how
they're
going
to
rule
on
this
claim.
it...
harris
v.
reed
concerns
claims
that
are
fairly
presented
to
the
court
and
there
is
ambiguity
with
regard
to
whether
an
appellate
court
has
applied
procedural
bar
or
has
in
fact
addressed
the
merits.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
if
it
had
found
that
there
was
sufficient
merit
to
pique
its
interest,
yes,
it
could
have.
and
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
what
3...
what
the
rule
9.330
is
all
about.
like
any
court
that
has
the
ability
to
rehear,
the
state
would
submit
that
when
you
tender
an
argument
every
appellate
court
would
be
held
hostage
if
a
defendant
could
in
fact
raise
a
new
claim
on
rehearing
that
had
not
been
fairly
and
properly
raised
on
direct
appeal.
they
would
always
be
in
a
posture
of
being
blindsided
by
those
claims
if
the
court
just
merely
said,
denied.
and
in
fact,
i
believe
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
court
rule
which
is
cited
in
our--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that
could
have
been
done
and,
and
in
a
perfect
world
i
would
be
very
happy
if
that
had
occurred,
but
the
point
of
the
matter
is
the
most--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that's
true,
but
i
think
that
as
arguments
have
been
presented
to
this
court
with
regard
to
a
case
that...
just
accept
the
argument
hasn't
been
prepared
but
the
lower
court
discussed
it,
that
to
require
a
court
to
say
that
might
necessarily
require
a
detailed
opinion
with
regard
to
how
many
justices
might
view
that
particular
claim.
it
all
might
not
be
on
the
same
basis.
and
in
fact,
we
have
a
routine
procedure
and
most,
most
rehearing...
courts
that
have
rehearing
procedures
or
have
the
ability
to
file
rehearings
assume
that
if
there's
something
that
has
piqued
the
court's
interest,
they
will
address
it
and
either
clarify
it
or
modify
it.
and
in
fact
our
rehearing
rule
is
a
rule
that
says
you
cannot
argue
something...
you
can't
argue
something
new,
you
can't
raise
things
that
have
been
already
argued,
and
it's
to
allow
for
any
misapprehension
or
misapplication
of
law.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
argument
that
has
been
preserved
or
allegedly
preserved
did
not
fall
into
that
category
and
were
improper
with
regard
to
the
filing
of
rehearing.
the
state's
argument
is
that
this
claim
has
never
fairly
been
presented
to
a
state
court
and
certainly
we
should
not
be
bound
by
harris
v.
reed's
plain
statement
and
the
fact
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
correct
in
making
that
analysis
that
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
with
regard
to
the
first
issue
and
the
jury
override
that
took
place...
as
i
understood
the
issue
before
the
court,
it
was
whether
the
left
open
question
in
spaziano
was
before
this
court...
what
standard
should
be
applied
in
individual
cases?
should
it
be
an
analysis
that
has
been
discussed
by
this
court
with
regard
to
walton
and
lewis
v.
jeffers
and
in
fact
godfrey
v.
georgia,
or
in
fact
is
there
an
independent
state
basis
because
tedder
is
a
state
standard
and
therefore
there
is
nothing
beyond
a
determination
that
the
standard
is
appropriate,
the
court
does
routinely
apply--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
would
say
there
were
nonstatutory
evidence
submitted.
whether
it
was
established
or
not--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
don't
believe
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
intoxicated.
there
was
evidence
during
the
course
of
the
record
to
reflect
that
they
had
ingested
drugs
and
had
been
drinking
or
had
drinks
during
the
day.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
was
intoxicated,
did
not
appreciate--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--based
on
this
particular
record,
that
is
correct.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
in
fact
the
disparity
in
the
sentencing
is
a
very
good
point,
because
in
fact
the
person...
the
ah,
elaine
parker,
who
was
his
ex-wife,
turned
witness
and
got
second-degree
murder.
billy
long
who
actually
did
the
shooting
and
who
was
impugned
to
do
the
shooting
by
both
parker
and
in
fact
tommy
groover
got
a
life
sentence.
mr.
groover,
who
was
part
and
parcel
to
this
drug
collection
day
with,
which
it
resulted
in
three
deaths
got
the
death
penalty
for
the
padgett
murder
and
the
jody
dalton
murder
and
got
life
for
the
nancy
sheppard
murder.
he
in
fact
did
not
participate
in
the
nancy
sheppard
murder
to
the
extent
that
mr.
parker
did
nor--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
am
suggesting
that
there
were
other
sentences...
there
were
other
sentences
other
than--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--this
trial
judge
was
also
the
trial
judge
in
the
tommy
groover
case
and
knew
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
sentence
of
death
imposed
in
those
cases--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
trial
judge
in
this
case...
i
think
he
took
it
into
account
and
found
that
it
was
not
a
valid
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance
based
on
the
facts
and
mr.
parker's
participation
in
the
nancy
sheppard
murder.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
he,
he
does
not
explain,
he
doesn't
go
into
graphic
detail.
he
explains--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that's
absolutely
true,
but
he
in
fact--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--he...
i
would
agree
that
if
there
was
evidence
that
he
did
not
do
that,
that
would
be--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
think
that
the
state
has
to
come
forward
on
an
appellate
review
before
the
florida
supreme
court
and
make
an
assessment
as
to
whether
in
fact
he
properly
followed
the
law
as
it
is
applied
in
florida.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
what
they
found
was
the
trial--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--absolutely.
but
after
that...
what's
important--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--they
had
to
be
balanced,
but
important
as
to
what
was
quoted
to
the
court
right
after
the
phrase
about
how
there
were
four
properly
applied.
in
light
of
these
findings
of
facts
suggesting
the
sentence
of
death
are
so
clear
and
convincing
that
virtually
no
reasonable
person
could
differ.
they
cited
tedder
v.
state,
their
own
standard
with
regard
to
jury
overrides
and
then
they
say--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that
in
fact
they
were
applying
an
appropriate
standard.
they
were
doing
their
analysis
as
they
had
done
in
every
case
before.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
they
were
making
their
independent
determination
because
the
next
line
says,
the
jury
override
was
proper
and
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
place
it
within
the
class
of
homicides
for
which
the
death
penalty--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--has
been
found
appropriate.
spaziano
v.
florida.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
in
perhaps
shortened
language--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--in
the
sense,
in
the
sense--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
it
is.
i
think
they
have,
they
have
applied
the
standard
that
is
set
forth
and
to
reach
that
standard
you...
this
court
in
spaziano
had
to
review
that
which
the
florida
supreme
court
has
done
and
in
fact
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
nor
any
other
case
since
spaziano
to
reflect
that
spaziano
was
in
fact
wrong
or
that
there's
been
any
change
with
regard
to
the
florida
supreme
court's
assessment
of
jury
overrides
and
in
fact
the
statistics
that
are
being
presented
in
the
pleadings
bear
out
what
the
state
says
more
than
what
the
defendant
says,
because
in
fact
the
history
of
the
tedder
standard
as
applied
in
florida
has
been
a
very
careful
one.
it's
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
for
the
state
to
sustain
in
the
florida
supreme
court
is
a
jury
override.
in
fact,
less
than
30
percent
of
the
overrides
that
have
gone
before
the
court
have
been
sustained
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
what
is
really
being
asked
of
the
court
today
is
for
you
to
make--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--right.
that's
absolutely
correct.
it
was
a
higher
number,
but
i
think
we
have
to
remember
what
has
occurred
during
that
period
of
time.
this
court
had
just
decided
spaziano,
and
to
suggest
that
the
court
was
not
aware
of
what
was
occurring
in
spaziano
and
also
not...
probably
holding
cases
back
that
were
of
the
genre
would
be
misreading
what
courts
do
and
that
is
they
may
very
well
have
those
cases
that
are
important
to
them
and
they're
waiting
for
a
decision
to
resolve
it.
not
all
those
cases
were
in
fact
affirmed.
and...
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
this
through
the
period
of
time,
that
is,
the
existence
of
the
tedder
standard
and
throughout
the
application
of
the
tedder
standard,
it's
been
very
difficult
and
the
florida
supreme
court
has
not
been
rubber
stamping,
in
essence,
jury
overrides.
and
in
fact
the
statements
that
are
suggested
that
the
court
has
now
made
pronouncements
that
there
is...
we
mean
what
we
say...
we
intend
what
we
mean
with
regard
to,
to
tedder
was
not
a
reinvesting
of
a
procedure
in
the
florida
supreme
court
but
it
was
warning
and
fair
warning
to
the
trial
courts
of
the
state
of
florida
that
we
intend
to
abide
and
we
will
continue
to
abide
by
the
tedder
standard.
the
state
would
submit
that
at
best
this
court's
decision
in
lewis
v.
jeffers
controls...
no
relation
be
forthcoming.
the
state
is
not
willing
at
this
point
to
absolutely
give
up
that
in
fact
spaziano
ended
the
inquiry
and
that
there
should
not
be
a...
there
should
be
some
further
inquiry
to
make
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
that
certainly
is
what
the
federal
district
court
judge
did--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
think
the
florida
supreme...
yes,
and
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
had
six
statutory
aggravating
factors
that
was
before
it
with
regard
to
what
the
trial
court
found.
they,
they
determined
after
consideration
of
this
whole
record
that
those...
there
were
two
statutory
aggravating
factors
that
were
not
appropriate.
they
then
reviewed
those,
the
availability
of
those
aggravating
factors
based
on
the
statutory
and
nonstatutory
mitigation
that
was
tendered.
and
this,
this
is
borne
out
by
the
arguments--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
they
took
into
consideration
both
statutory
and
nonstatutory.
it...
they
did
not
speak
to
that
nor...
but
they're
not
required
to
speak
to
that.
and
we
have
to
presume
that
they
follow
the
law.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
think
what
they
did
was
they
considered
what
the
statutory...
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
were
tendered
and
they
did
the
requisite
determination
as
to
what
was
presented
and
found
it
did
not
rise
to
the
level
that
satisfied
that
the
mitigation
outweighed
the
aggravation
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
has
to
be
a
per
se
finding--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--no,
the
numbers
don't
matter.
the
numbers
do
not
matter
in
florida.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
think
what...
but
again
you're
asking
me
something
that
i
can't
tell
you--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--because
it
doesn't
specifically
speak
to
it,
but
i
can
tell...
i
can
suggest
to
you
that
based
on
the
instructions
given,
based
on
the
evidence
presented,
we
presume
the
trial
court
follows
the
law.
he
knew
that
evidence
of
nonstatutory
mitigating
evidence
was
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
he
in...
he'd
so
instruct
the
jury.
the
florida
supreme
court
reviewed
this
record,
found
that
he
was
correct
and
we
have
to
presume
that
they
make
a
proper
analysis.
they're
not
really
under
attack
with
regard
to
their
analysis.
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
(a)
he's
not
required
to
list
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
factors
he
may
or
may
not
have
found.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
absolutely,
but
we
know...
but
the
record
requires
and
the...
excuse
me...
the
statutes
and
the
case
law
requires
you
consider
it
and
that's
what
we
have
to
be
concerned
with.
did
he
consider
it?
the
fact
that
you
and
i
may
say,
yes,
in
this
particular
case,
we
find
this
is
a
valid
mitigating
factor,
is
not
for
us
to
do.
it's
whether--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--but
i
think
that
they're
getting
at
the
same
thing.
it's
just
that
we
have...
in
many
of
these
cases,
it's
not
artfully
presented
with
regard
to
exactly
what
the
factors
were
that
were
balanced,
whether
they
were
mitigating
factors
of
a
statutory
nature.
we
have
the
statute
basically
requires
you
make
written
findings
of
those
and
those
are
more,
more
important
because
under
the
statute...
but
we
cannot
avoid
nor
do
we
require
that
the
state
trial
court
list
with
particularity
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
factors
that
are
presented
and
that
he
finds.
but
i
think
hitchcock,
lockett
require
the
consideration.
it
does
not
mandate
that
he
find
those
statutory
mitigating
factors.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
absolutely
correct.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
but
i
think
that
is
indicative
of
the
period
of
time
we're
talking
about
also,
because
the
statutes--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yeah,
no,
what,
what
i
was
going
to
point
to
was
the
statute
provide
that
you
make
written
findings
and
the
emphasis
was
at
that
point
in
time
on
the
statutory
mitigating
factors.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
read
into
any
of
these
cases
that,
and
in
particular
this
particular
case
with
regard
to
the
override,
that
the
trial
court
did
not
consider
that,
that
which
was
submitted
to
him,
and
i
mean
we're
making
this
quantum
leap
from
what
in
fact
was
presented
because
there
was
a
wealth
of
evidence
that
one
might
consider
nonstatutory
mitigating
factors.
the
jury
was
so
instructed
to
that.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
we
have
an
opinion
by
the
trial
court
or
an
order
by
the
trial
court
that
does
not
fully
explain
what
in
fact
he
considered,
not
that
he
had
to
find,
but
what
he
considered.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
he
has
presumed
to
have
followed
the
law.
the
state
would
urge,
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
be
affirmed
that
it
is
correct
with
regard
to
the
procedural
bar
claim
as
to
the
stromberg
issue
and
that
they
were
absolutely
correct
in
applying
spaziano
with
regard
to
whether
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case
properly
overrode
the
jury's
recommendation
of
life.
the
standard
to
be
applied
is
properly
set
out
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
we
are
not
here
as
the
federal
district
court
did
to
reinvestigate
and
present
our
change
or
our
view
of
how
the
facts
come
out...
should
come
out
but
rather
to
ascertain
whether
in
fact
the
appellate
court
properly
conducted
its
role.
in
this
instance
i
would
say
it
has.
we
ask
that
you
affirm.
thank
you.
