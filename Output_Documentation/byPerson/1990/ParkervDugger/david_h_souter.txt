justice
souter
well,
under,
under
florida
law,
he's
required
to,
to
weigh
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
against
aggravating
as
i
understand
it.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
is
he
required
to
weigh
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
against
the
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
souter
so
if
they
had
said
not
merely
that
the
trial
court
found
none,
but
had
said
we
have
independently
reviewed
the
record
and
we
find
no
basis
for
concluding
that
mitigating
circumstances
were
present,
you
would
not
have
an
argument?
justice
souter
are
we
entitled
to
assume
that
the
florida
court
followed
its
own
law
even
though
it
did
not
expressly
say
so?
justice
souter
well,
they
didn't
tell
us
that
they
did
not
do
it.
they
simply
spoke
of
the
appropriateness
of
what
the
trial
court
did
and
they
didn't
specifically
say,
we
have
gone
through
this
independent
analysis.
it's
silence
on
their
part,
isn't
it,
rather
than
a
confession
of
error?
justice
souter
--leaving,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
whether
he
was
a
voluntary
participant
or
not,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
also
making
the
claim
that
based
on
the
court's
own...
from
the
trial
court's
own
finding,
there
are
the...
i'm
sorry,
the
appellate
court's
own
finding,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
from
which
a
robbery
could
have
been
found,
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
all
right,
now,
as
i
understand
it...
i
went
to
the
appendix,
and
as
i
understand
it
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
raised
prior
to
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
and
i'll,
i'll
accept
your
position
on
that.
was
this
issue
raised
on
the
first
habeas?
justice
souter
well,
i,
i
didn't,
if
didn't
mean
that,
but
i
will
ask
that,
too.
justice
souter
that's
when
you
moved
for
rehearing,
that's
how
you
raised
that.
justice
souter
now
on
first
habeas
was
it
raised?
justice
souter
what
then
is
your
answer
to
the
question
that
you
have
waived
it
for
collateral
review?
justice
souter
so
you
defend
on
florida
procedure
then?
justice
souter
did
they
raise
it
at
the
trial
court?
