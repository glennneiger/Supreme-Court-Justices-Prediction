justice
souter
mr.
sloan,
you
spoke
of
the
question
of
relative
deferences
between
the
secretary
and
osha
as
being
a
threshold
question.
why
isn't
the
threshold
question
the
one
which
justice
stevens
began
to
pose,
and
that
is
whether
the
secretary's
interpretation
can
be
accepted
by
us
as
reasonable
in
the
first
place?
because
if
it
isn't,
i
don't
see
how
we
get
to
the
question
of
relative
deference.
