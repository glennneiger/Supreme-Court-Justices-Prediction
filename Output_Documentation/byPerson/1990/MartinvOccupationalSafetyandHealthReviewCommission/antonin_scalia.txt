justice
scalia
mr.
sloan,
i
don't
know
why
you,
i
thought
you
conceded
earlier
that
the
preliminary
issue
was
whether
this
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
secretary
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
neither
of
those
two
questions
is
logically
prior.
we
don't
have
to
consider
whether
deference
is
due
if
it's
unreasonable,
but
just
as
equal...
equally
we
don't
have
to
consider
whether
it's
unreasonable
if
no
deference
is
due.
i
don't
know
how
one
can
identify
either
of
those
two
questions
as
the
prior
one.
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
other
if
you
answer
the
other
one
a
certain
way.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
did.
all
right.
justice
scalia
it's
the
more
important
question,
no
doubt.
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
why
isn't
the
issuance
of
a
citation...
is
it
the
official
act
of
the
secretary
or
not?
is
it?
justice
scalia
is
it
a
governmental
act?
justice
scalia
and
official.
then
why...
then
why
does
it
get
stronger,
why
would
an
unreasonable
interpretation,
you
say,
only
become
more
reasonable
if
there
have
been
a
large
number
of
citation
orders?
i
mean,
it's
either
reasonable
or
it's
unreasonable.
10,000
repetitions
makes
it
truth?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
scalia
i
think
you
can
play
that
in
reverse.
i
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
gives
notice,
but
i
don't
think
that
when
you
give
somebody
notice
you
have
thereby
achieved
a
reasonable
interpretation.
i
mean,
if
i
give
you
notice
of
an
unreasonable
interpretation,
it
doesn't
become
more
reasonable
by
the
fact
that
i
gave
you
notice
of
it.
justice
scalia
i
hereby
advise
you
i'm
going
to
interpret
black
to
mean
white.
that
doesn't
make
that
interpretation
reasonable.
justice
scalia
mr.
faught,
maybe
that's
true,
but
it's
certainly
not
true
because
congress
wanted
to
create
an
independent,
as
you
have
described
it,
an
independent
adjudicative
agency.
i
mean,
the
supreme
example
of
an
independent
adjudicative
agency
is
an
article
iii
court.
and
all
the
government
is
arguing
for
here
is
to
apply
the
same
rule
to
this
adjudicative
agency
as
article
iii
courts
apply.
so
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
just
adjudicative
power
that
you're
arguing
for
here.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
osha
can
develop
regulations
through
its
adjudication
the
way
the
labor
board
can,
for
example?
you
know,
labor...
it
doesn't
issue
regulations
normally.
they
just
make
up
new
rules
in
adjudication.
can
osha
do
that?
justice
scalia
that
impose
new
substantive
obligations
that
are
not
imposed
by
the
secretary's
regulations?
justice
scalia
can
you
answer
that?
just
answer
that
one
yes
or
no,
and
then
go
on
and
give
me
the
other
ways.
can
it
enact,
impose
substantive
requirements
upon
individuals
that
are
not
imposed
by
the
secretary's
regulations?
justice
scalia
it
can?
justice
scalia
such
as?
justice
scalia
that's
not
a
new
substantive
rule.
that's
just
interpreting
what
the
statute
says.
it
can
interpret
what
the
statute
says,
it
can
interpret
what
the
regs
say.
but
can
it...
can
it
make
policy
in
the
sense
of
imposing
new
obligations
upon
people,
the
way
an
agency
can
do
by
adjudication?
justice
scalia
what
was
the
litigation
position
involved
in
bowen?
justice
scalia
right,
defending
against
a
suit
against
the
secretary,
right?
justice
scalia
but
there,
there
the
mere
action
that
the
secretary
had
taken
in
bowen
didn't
bespeak
that
interpretation.
when
it
came
to
defending
itself,
the
department
came
up
with
this
interpretation.
i
thought
that's
what
we
meant
by
a
litigating
position.
but
here
when
the
secretary
brings
a
citation,
you
don't
have
to
guess
what
the
basis
is.
it
was
cited
for
violation
of
this
section
in
particular.
that
is
not
a
litigating
position,
except
to
the
extent
that
any
implementation
of
the
law
by
the
agency
is
a
litigating
position.
that...
your
position
then
is
that
the
agency
can
only
clarify
a
regulation
by
another
regulation.
is
there
anything
else,
any
other
way
it
can
clarify
the
meaning
of
a
regulation?
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
so
it
can't
clarify
a
regulation.
it
can
only
amend
it.
justice
scalia
is
this
so
for
all
agencies,
or
is
this
just
osha?
justice
scalia
but
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
deferring
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation.
indeed
some
of
our
cases
say
that
we're
even
more
inclined
to
defer
to
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulations
than
we
are
to
an
agency
interpretation
of
its
statute.
and
we're
not
referring
to
its
interpretation
through
an
additional
regulation.
how
do
you
explain
all
those
cases?
justice
scalia
so
when
the
fcc
prosecutes
somebody
for
a
violation
of
one
of
its
regulations
in
a
district
court,
let's
say,
and
the
case
comes
to
a
district
court,
and
the
fcc's
position
is
reasonable
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
regulation,
we
would
not
defer
to
the
fcc,
you
would
say?
justice
scalia
no,
this
is
a
regulation.
it's
an
fcc
regulation
that
they
are
proceeding
under.
the
issue
is
the
interpretation
of
that
regulation.
and
what
you
say
is
we
would
give
no
deference
to
the
fcc.
the
only
way
we
would
give
deference
to
the
fcc
is
if
it
amended
the
regulation.
but
its
interpretation
of
the
regulation
is
entitled
to
no
deference
under
chevron.
justice
scalia
but
not
to
the
fcc's
interpretation
of
the
regulation?
justice
scalia
not
just
arguing
in
court.
the
citation
was
based
on
their
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
justice
scalia
and
you
say
it
would
not
get
chevron--
justice
scalia
--mr.
faught,
is
it
your
position
that
the,
that
osha
does
not
defer
to
the
secretary
with
respect
to
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
regulations?
suppose
a
case
comes
up
in
which
there
is
no
regulation
at
issue,
but
just
the
terms
of
the
statute,
and
the
secretary
has
taken
a
particular
interpretation.
does
osha
defer
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
scalia
no,
no.
not
through
rule
making.
he
brings
a
citation
just
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
rule
specifically
addressed
to
it,
but
he
says
the
statute
authorizes
this.
justice
scalia
not
controlling
weight.
but
if
the
secretary
interpreted
the
same
statute
in
an
action
that
would
come
to
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
third
branch
of
government
would
defer
to
the
secretary's
interpretation?
justice
scalia
mr.
faught,
in
bowen...
i'll
try
to
put
it
again;
i'm
not
sure
you're
responding
to
what
seems
to
be
the
problem.
in
bowen,
the
official
action
was
simply
the
denial
of
benefits.
that's
the
authorized
governmental
action
taken
by
the
agency.
and
that
action
didn't
necessarily
rest
on
a
particular
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
didn't
bespeak
anything.
it
was
just
a
denial
of
the
benefits.
then
the
litigation
comes
up,
he
comes
up
with
this
theory.
that's
a
litigating
position.
here
the
official
action
was
the
issuance
of
the
citation.
that
was
not
neutral.
on
the
face
of
it
it
referred
to
this
section.
on
the
face
of
it
it
necessarily
was
an
official
administrative
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
don't
you
see
a
difference
between
those
two
situations
as
to
what's
a
litigating
position
and
what
isn't?
