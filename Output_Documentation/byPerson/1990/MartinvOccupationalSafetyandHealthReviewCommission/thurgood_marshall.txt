justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
martin
versus
occupational
safety
and
health
review
commission,
no.
89-1541.
that
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
authorizes
a
secretary
of
labor
to
prosecute
civil
penalty
actions
before
the
occupational
safety
and
health
review
commission.
the
question
here
in
this
case
is
whether
a
reviewing
court
should
defer
to
the
secretary
or
to
the
commission
when
these
two
actions
act
or
disagree
on
the
interpretation
of
a
regulation.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
court
must
divert
to
the
secretary
under
the
circumstances.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit.
