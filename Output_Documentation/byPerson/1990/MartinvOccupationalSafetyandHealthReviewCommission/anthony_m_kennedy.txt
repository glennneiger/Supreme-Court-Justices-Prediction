but
in
this
case
it
was
a
citation.
the
secretary
took
official
action
citing
the
company
for
a
violation
of
the
act.
this
wasn't
just
an
interpretation
that
was
developed
in
the
course
of
an
adjudicated
proceeding
to
defend
a
statute...
to
defend
a
regulation.
justice

but
that
is
done
in
the
context
of
the
exercise
of
the
secretary's
administrative
authority.
a
citation
has
been
issued
through
the
administrative
process
based
on
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
and
we
have
always
said
that
an
administrative
construction
of
the
regulation
by
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
great
deference.
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
is.
