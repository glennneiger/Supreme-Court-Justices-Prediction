justice
stevens
are
you,
therefore,
mr.
sloan,
asking
us
to
send
the
case
back
so
the
court
can
address
that
question,
or
are
you
asking
us
to
decide
it?
justice
stevens
would
you
agree
that
if
one
just
reads
(e)(5),
that
the
secretary's
position
is
unreasonable?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it's
presented
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
that
needs...
justifying
deferring
to
somebody.
if
the
language
were
absolutely
clear
one
way
or
the
other,
we
certainly
wouldn't
be
arguing
about
deference,
would
we?
justice
stevens
they
assume
that
there
was
ambiguity,
and
therefore
they
decided
which
one
to
have
to
defer
to.
and
you
have
presented
the
case
on
the
assumption
there
is
ambiguity.
so
in
other
words
you
have
assumed,
you
have
gone
past
the
hurdle
that
justice
souter
raised.
but
if
you're
starting
from
scratch,
you're
the
first
reviewing
court,
and
it
looks
absolutely
clear
to
you,
you're
not
going
to
worry
about
deference,
are
you?
