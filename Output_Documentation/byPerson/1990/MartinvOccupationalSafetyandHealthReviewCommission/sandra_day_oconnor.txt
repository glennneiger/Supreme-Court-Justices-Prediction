justice
o'connor
mr.
sloan,
does
that
same
principle
apply
to
the
commission
itself
when
it
decides
issues?
does
it
have
to
defer
to
the
secretary's
interpretation?
justice
o'connor
so
the
error
that
was
made
here,
in
your
view,
was
made
at
the
commission
level
by
its
failure
to
defer
to
the
secretary's
position?
justice
o'connor
i'm
curious
here.
there
is
a
regulation
that
appears
to
be
more
clearly
in
point
for
this
particular
violation,
and
that
was
(g)(4)(i),
and
the
secretary,
or
the
department
never
amended
its
complaint
to
refer
to
that
regulation.
it
chose
to
rely
instead
on
the
training
regulation
for
the
violation.
why
was
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
when
you
rely
on
the
training
regulation,
it's
perhaps
ambiguous,
or
you
have
to
stretch
to
see
how
it
applies.
but
if
reliance
had
been
placed
on
the
other
regulation
it
would
seem
rather
clear,
wouldn't
it?
justice
o'connor
yeah,
i
just...
it
seems
the
present
interpretation
would
appear
to
make
it
duplicative.
you
don't
even
need
(g)(4)(i),
i
guess,
in
light
of
the
secretary's
reading
of
the
training
regulation.
justice
o'connor
that
may
be
interesting
background,
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
question,
because
the
shorter
version
was
in
effect,
was
it
not?
justice
o'connor
here,
yes.
justice
o'connor
so
why
wasn't
it
used
or
cited?
justice
o'connor
mr.
sloan,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
same
degree
of
deference
is
owed
to
the
secretary
if
her
position
is
taken
only
in
a
compliance
order
or
in
the
litigation
itself,
rather
than
in
some
other
forum,
to
whit,
a
consistent
interpretation
or
one
adopted
by
rule,
or
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
it
just
comes
to
the
commission
to
decide,
and
all
they
have
is
that
particular
compliance
order.
do
they
have
to
bow
down
and
defer
every
single
time
because
the
secretary
has
issued
a
compliance
order?
justice
o'connor
so
the
commission
has
to
defer,
and
the
court
subsequently
has
to
defer?
how
do
they
apply
their
analysis
when
that's
all
you
have?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
if
there
were
no
commission
and
the
question
went
to
an
article
iii
court,
the
same
question
we
have
here,
would
the
article
iii
court
defer
to
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
regulation?
justice
o'connor
oh,
so
your
answer
is
that
you
only
defer
to
certain
kinds
of
interpretations,
but
not
to
an
interpretation
developed
and
presented
during
the
course
of
litigation.
is
that
your
position?
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
have
authority
from
this
court
for
that
proposition?
