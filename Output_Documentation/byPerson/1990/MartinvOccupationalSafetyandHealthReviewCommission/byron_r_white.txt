justice
white
well,
i
suppose
part
of
your...
part
of
the
question
you
presented
is
whether
the
secretary's
position
is
reasonable?
because
you
don't
defer
to
something
that's
unreasonable.
justice
white
you
may...
i
suppose
you
would
think
we
would
be
unreasonable
if
we
said
that
the
secretary's
position
is
unreasonable.
but,
nevertheless,
what
if
we
thought
that?
i
don't
know
why
we
should
get
mixed
up
with
questions
of
deference
then.
justice
white
well,
if
the...
you
think
the
issue
here
is
just
whether
there
should
be
deference
or
not,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
that
it
was
entitled
to
any
deference,
so
it
didn't
reach
the
reasonableness.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
white
exactly.
so
we
don't
need
to...
we
don't
need...
technically
we
don't
need
to
get
mixed
up
into
the
reasonableness
issue.
justice
white
mr.
faught,
i
suppose
congress
could
have
just
not
have
provided
for
administrative
adjudication
at
all.
that
could
have
been
just
a
direct
enforcement
statute
where
if
the
secretary
wanted
to
enforce
the
statute,
the
secretary
would
have
to
go
to
an
article
iii
court.
justice
white
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
where
you
don't
have
an
administrative
agency
adjudicating.
the
enforcer
just
has
to
go
to
court.
and
if
that
had
been
the
case,
i
suppose
an
article
iii
court
would
have
been
faced
with
the
same
question,
do
we
have
to
defer
to
the
secretary
or
not,
or
should
we
just
make
our
own
completely
independent
judgment
about
what
the
statute
means
or
what
the
regulation
means.
justice
white
what?
justice
white
i
know
that,
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
had
put
it
in
a
court,
an
article
iii
court.
what
would
be
the
rule
an
article
iii
court
would
have
to
follow
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
a...
the
secretary's
regulation?
justice
white
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
the...
you
think
osha,
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
follow
chevron,
is
that
it?
justice
white
a
court
would
have
to,
but
the
commission
doesn't?
justice
white
what
do
you,
what
would
you
say
if...
would
you
say
we
would
be
dead
wrong
if
we
gave
some
deference
to
the...
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
view
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
white
well,
here's
the...
they
issue
a
complaint
and
they
adjudicate,
and
they
present
a
view...
their
interpretation
of
this
statute
when
it's
challenged.
i
thought
we
frequently
gave
deference
to
the
nlrb?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they've
never
issued
a
rule
in
the
history.
justice
white
maybe
one
or
two
procedural
rules,
but
they
don't
have
to
get
up
and
have
a
big
rule-making
authority,
proceeding,
to
announce
a
construction
of
the
statute
that
is
entitled
to
deference.
justice
white
well,
that's
just...
that's
just
exactly...
that's
just...
that's
exactly
what
the
secretary
did
in
this
case.
just
took
out
after
somebody
to
enforce
the
statute,
and...
and
was
expressing
a...
her
view
of
the
statute.
just
like
the
nlrb
does
when
it--
