mr.
john
d.
faught
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
this
case
is
about
is
a
direct
attack
by
the
secretary
of
labor
on
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
and
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
secretary
seeks
to
overturn
a
compromise
reached
by
congress
when
it
considered
this
legislation
more
than
20
years
ago,
and
she
seeks
to
upset
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
that
has
been
in
place
since
that
time.
in
considering
the
alternative
bills
before
it
in
1970,
members
of
congress
expressed
strong
concern
that
placing
all
the
administrative
power
in
one
agency
head,
the
secretary
of
the
labor,
would
not
gain
the
acceptance
of
the
regulated
community
that
was
necessary
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
act.
to
resolve
these
concerns
congress
reached
a
compromise,
and
that
compromise
was
to
remove
the
adjudicatory
authority
from
the
secretary
and
place
it
in
an
independent
agency,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
review
commission.
the
review
commission
was
given
the
express
authority
to
carry
out
the
adjudicatory
functions
of
the...
under
the
act.
the
secretary's
position
today
is
that
the
commission
has
no
policy-making
authority
in
its
role
as
the
adjudicator.
the
secretary
in
a
sense...
her
position
would
rip
the
heart
out
of
the
adjudicatory
authority
that
has
been
given
to
the
commission,
and
would
render
the
commission
nothing
more
than
a
rubber
stamp.
mr.
john
d.
faught
that
is
not--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--that
is
not
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
john
d.
faught
what
congress
created
was
an
independent
administrative
agency.
mr.
john
d.
faught
the
article
iii
court
would
look
at
the...
what
chevron,
and
apply
the
analysis
under
chevron
as
to
whether
it
gives
way
to
the
court
or
way
to
the
secretary.
mr.
john
d.
faught
your
honor,
chevron
is
a
judicial--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--the
commission
would
not
follow
chevron
per
se,
if
i
may
explain.
chevron
is
a
judicial
rule,
so
it
does
not
directly
apply
to
the
commission.
the
commission
would,
if
the
secretary
promulgated
an
unambiguous
standard
under
its
rule-making
authority,
then,
as
the
commission
agreed
in
its
amicus
brief,
the
commission
would
be
bound
by
that
rule.
however,
if
the
rule
is
ambiguous,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
that
is
exactly
the
function
that
congress
wanted
this
commission
to
carry
out.
and
it's
particularly
important
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
area.
mr.
john
d.
faught
as
this
court
has
held
in
a
long
series
of
cases,
beginning
with
sec
v.
chenery,
justice
scalia,
is
that
an
administrative
agency
in
adjudicatory
power
also
has
the
power
to
make
policy.
that
is
the
exact
kind
of
thing
that
congress
wanted
to
create
in
the
commission
here.
because
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
area
it
applies
to
many
industries.
it
has
a
very
broad
spectrum,
and
it
applies
to
many
aspects
of
those
injuries...
those
industries.
and
therefore
the
adjudicatory
function
is
important,
that
based
on
facts
of
helping
to
develop
this
policy,
of,
in
effect,
developing
a
common
law.
and
that's
where
the
commission's
role
is
very
important
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
area.
mr.
john
d.
faught
they
cannot
make
up
rules
in
terms
of
rule-making
power,
which
is
given
to
the
secretary.
but
they
can
make
up
principles
of
law,
and
in
fact
they
have.
mr.
john
d.
faught
they
can...
the
commission
can
act
in
a
number
of
ways.
it
can,
one,
it
can--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--yes,
it
can.
mr.
john
d.
faught
yes,
it
can.
and
it
has.
mr.
john
d.
faught
such
as
the
commission
has
interpreted
what
is
a
repeated
violation
under
the
act.
the
act
provides
that
an
employer
may
be
fined
up
to
$10,000
for
a
repeated
violation.
the
act,
however,
does
not
define
what
is
a
repeated
violation.
the
commission
has
developed
the
principles
of
law
in
defining
what
constitutes--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--it
cannot
make
policy
in
the
sense
of
establishing
substantive
standards,
which
is
the
power
of
the
secretary
under
its
rule-making
authority.
but
under
the
adjudicatory
authority
it
does
include
some
inherent
policy
making.
and
inherent
in
that
policy
making
is
precisely
the
question
the
court
has
before
it
today,
is
you
have
an
ambiguous
standard.
and
in
that
inherent
adjudicatory
power
that
includes
some
policy,
the
commission
can
decide
that
question.
it
can
interpret
what
that
standard
means.
and
that
is
precisely
what
it
has
done
in
this
case.
mr.
john
d.
faught
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
answer
is
no,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
matter
that
is
presented
here
by
the
secretary,
her
interpretation
of
the
standard
is
not
based
on
her
rule-making
authority.
if
it
was
based
on
the
rule-making
authority,
then
the
court
would
apply
chevron
and
could
give
controlling
weight.
but
what
she
presents
here
is
not
based
on
rule-making
authority.
it's
her
interpretation
presented
through
litigation
positions.
and
those
positions,
we
would
maintain,
would
not
be
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
john
d.
faught
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
faught
yes.
mr.
john
d.
faught
bowen
v.
georgetown
university
makes
it
very
clear
that
litigation
positions
are
not
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
as
justice
kennedy
wrote,
chevron
simply
does
not
apply
to
litigation
positions.
mr.
john
d.
faught
what
you
have
here,
justice
kennedy,
is
an
ambiguous
standard.
and
the
secretary,
in
effect,
admits
that
it's
ambiguous.
and
the
only
way
that
she
is
clarifying
it
is
through
the
litigation
positions
that
she
is
presenting
in
court.
she
clarifies
it
by
the
issuance
of
the
citation
by
the
compliance
officer
and
by
the
arguments
of
counsel.
that
is
the
only
way
she
is
clarifying,
and
we
believe
under
bowen
that
those
litigation
positions
are
not
entitled
to
deference.
had
she
said,
had
the
standard
been
unambiguous,
then
the
question
of
deference
would
be
here
for
the
secretary.
but
it
simply
does
not
apply.
the
secretary,
in
saying--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--the
litigation
position
involved
the
retroactive
application
of
a
wage
index
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
mr.
john
d.
faught
that's
correct.
and
the
question
was,
argument
of
counsel
in
the
litigation
was
the
reason
for
the
retroactive
application
of
the
wage
index
was
because
it
was
a
cost
adjustment.
and
the
court
said
that
is
the
first
time
we
have
heard
that.
that's
the
first
expression
of
the
secretary's
interpretation.
very
much
the
same
we
have
here.
the
first
time
that
the
secretary
explains
what
this
standard
(g)(3)
means
is
by
the
citation
and
the
arguments
of
counsel.
mr.
john
d.
faught
and
to
be
entitled
to
chevron
deference?
mr.
john
d.
faught
no.
the
agency
must
act--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--to
be
entitled
to
controlling
weight,
it
would
have
to
act
through
what
the
authority
that
congress
has
delegated
it,
which
would
be
rule-making
authority.
that
does
not
mean
that
it
cannot
present
its
arguments
and
that
the
court
or
the
commission
should
not
give
weight
to
those
arguments.
the
question
is
controlling
weight.
controlling
weight
is
only
when
it
has
acted
in
its
rule-making
capacity.
mr.
john
d.
faught
it
would
be
for
all
agencies.
we
believe
that
is
the
appropriate
application
of
chevron,
and
there
has
been
a
recent
recommendation
of
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
that
agrees
with
our
position.
mr.
john
d.
faught
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
there
is...
there
is
confusing
language
about
the
controlling
weight
under
chevron
or
whether
you
give
considerable
deference.
and
in
our...
we
maintain
that
to
be
entitled
to
controlling
weight,
the
ultimate
deference,
the
agency
should
be
acting
in
the
capacity
that
congress
has
delegated.
and
if
the
agency
is
doing
something
less,
such
as
merely
offering
an
interpretation,
the
regulation
didn't
mean
what
she
said
it
does.
she
says
let
me
now
explain
to
you
what
the
regulation
means.
when
they
offer
that
kind
of
an
interpretation
it
may
be
entitled
to
some
weight,
but
the
court
needs
to
balance
the
factors
in
which
that
interpretation
is
made
and
decide
how
much
weight
is
given.
that
interpretation
may
be...
may
have
some
many
of
the
wrappings
around
it
that
it
looks
almost
like
the...
a
form
of
rule
making.
in
that
case,
the
weight
that
the
court
would
give
it
would
be
very
high.
it
may
approach
controlling
weight.
but
our
position
is
controlling
weight
is
for
those
delegated
authorities--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--if
the
action
of
the
fcc
is
based
on
the
authority
that
congress
has
delegated
to
it,
it
would
be
a
chevron
question--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--you
would
give
deference
to
the
regulation
as
an
interpretation
of
its
authority
under
the
statute--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--if
they
argued
in
court
and
gave
you
their
interpretation
that
added
to
it,
that
is
not
entitled
to--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--your
honor--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--if
the
citation...
if
the
citation
conforms
with
the
standard
and
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
standard,
then
the
agency
is
going
to
get
controlling
weight.
but
if
it's
something
less,
then
they
are
not.
if
you
look
at
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
congress
makes
it
very
clear
the
type
of
authority
it
placed
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
review
commission.
the
citations
issued
by
the
secretary
are
only
enforceable
as
final
orders
of
the
commission.
the
commission
has
exclusive
authority
to
impose
civil
penalties.
the
secretary
only
has
the
authority
to
recommend.
under
section
659
of
the
act,
if
a
citation
is
not
contested
it
becomes
a
final
order
of
the
commission
that
is
not
subject
to
review
by
any
court
or
any
agency.
if
it
is
contested,
then
the
commission
conducts
a
hearing.
that
hearing
is
conducted
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
the
commission
is
given
the
authority
to
affirm,
modify,
or
vacate
the
citation
of
the
commission.
therefore
congress
has
provided
the
commission
with
a
full
complement
of
adjudicatory
authority.
this
is
also
made
clear
by
the
reference
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
congress
said
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
adjudicate
under
the
act.
that
brings
into
play
the
cases
decided
by
this
court,
as
to
the
authority
an
adjudicatory
agency
has.
that
includes
policy-making
power.
the
secretary
here
argues
that
the
commission
has
no
policy-making
power.
it
does
not
even
have
the
power
to
interpret
an
ambiguous
standard.
that
is
directly
contrary
to
what
congress
said
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
and
it's
directly
contrary
to
the
precedents
of
this
court
establishing
what
the
powers
are
of
adjudicatory
agencies
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
believe
it
is
clear,
from
the
statute
and
the
apa,
the
kind
of
authority
the
commission
is
to
have
in
this
case.
if
the
court
believes
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
also
supports
our
position.
as
i
said
previously,
as
this
matter
was
being
considered
by
congress,
there
were
strong
concerns
presented
that
placing
all
of
the
authority
in
the
secretary
would
not
gain
the
confidence
of
the
regulated
community
necessary
to
achieve
voluntary
compliance,
necessary
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
act.
so
congress
reached
a
compromise,
and
that
compromise
was
to
place
adjudicatory
power
in
the
commission.
the
legislative
history
is
outlined
in
significant
detail
in
the
brief
of
the
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce,
beginning
at
page
13.
but
there
are
two
important
aspects
to
highlight.
one
is
the
competing
interests
that
were
involved
and
the
compromise
as
reached
by
congress.
the
other
is
the
role
models,
the
agencies
that
congress
was
looking
to
in
deciding
what
power
should
be
given
to
this
new
independent
agency,
the
commission.
and
in
looking
at
the
competing
interests,
what
congress
said,
and
the
compromise
that
was
reached,
is
that
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
area,
where
it
covers
such
a
broad
number
of
industries,
there
should
be
significant
power,
adjudicatory
power,
in
the
commission
to
deal
with
factual
settings
and
factual
circumstances.
and
congress
looked
to
the
ftc
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
the
examples
under
which
they
decided
the
authority
the
commission
should
have.
senator
javitz,
who
proposed
the
amendment
creating
the
commission,
referred
specifically
to
the
authority
of
the
ftc
when
referring
to
the
powers
of
the
commission.
mr.
john
d.
faught
if
the
secretary
interpreted
a
statute
through
a
rule
making,
as
delegated
by
congress,
it
would
be
binding
on
the
commission.
mr.
john
d.
faught
and
the
only
forum
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
was
the
citation
itself,
no,
it
is
not
entitled
to
any
controlling
weight
by
the
commission.
it
would
be
given
weight
by
the
commission,
but
not
necessarily
controlling
weight.
mr.
john
d.
faught
it's
our
position,
justice
scalia,
that
again
it
would
depend
on
the
forum,
that
if...
that
the
secretary
has
acted
in
a
fashion
authorized
by
congress,
then
the
court
should
apply
chevron
and
determine
whether
it
is
entitled
to
controlling
deference.
if
it
is
in
a
form
that
is
less
than
that
format
delegated
by
congress,
it
is
entitled
to
weight,
and
that
weight
will
depend
on
a
number
of
factors,
for
example
those
spelled
out
in
skidmore,
but
it
is
not
entitled
to
controlling
weight.
and
how
much
weight
is
going
to
depend
on
those
factors.
how
much
consideration
was
given,
the
reasoning
behind
the
interpretation.
as
i
said,
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
it
supports
our
position
that
congress
intended
the
commission
to
have
the
power
to
interpret
the
standards.
therefore
in
this
case
the
commission
has
acted
based
on
its
delegated
authority
from
congress.
and
when
you
apply
the
chevron
analysis,
that
action,
the
final
order,
which
is
the
subject
matter
before
the
court
today,
is
entitled
to
controlling
weight.
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
standard
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
is
in
accord
with
the
statute.
in
fact
the
secretary
here
does
not
contest
that
the
commission's
interpretation
is
reasonable.
it
is
therefore
entitled
to
controlling
weight.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
secretary's
position.
the
secretary's
position
here,
the
interpretation,
is
nothing
more
than
a
litigation
position.
it
was
presented
by
the
citation
issued
by
the
compliance
officer
and
as
argued
by
the
secretary's
counsel
in
court.
and
as
i
indicated
previously,
under
bowen
we
believe
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
litigation
positions
are
not
entitled
to
controlling
weight
under
chevron.
mr.
john
d.
faught
yes
it
is,
justice
scalia...
justice
rehnquist...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
on
the
face
of
it,
this
standard
does
not
require
what
the
secretary
says.
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
here
that
the
secretary
alleges
is
that
cf&i
did
not
provide
new
respirators.
there
is
nothing
in
(g)(3)
that
says
that
new
respirators
must
be
provided.
that
only
comes
about,
that
requirement
is
created
by
the
compliance
officer
when
he
issues
the
citation.
mr.
john
d.
faught
i
will
distinguish
again,
justice
kennedy,
between
considerable
deference
and
controlling
deference.
our
position
is
that
controlling
deference,
as
outlined
in
chevron,
only
applies
when
the
agency
is
acting
under
its
delegated
authority
by
congress,
in
a
format
delegated
by
congress.
if
it's
something
less
than
that,
yes,
it's
entitled
to
weight,
but
less
weight.
and
i...
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
around
the
word
deference.
we're
not
saying
that
interpretation
is
not
entitled
to
some
weight.
in
fact,
it
should
be
given
weight
by
the
commission,
and
it
was.
but
we
are
arguing
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
controlling
weight.
mr.
john
d.
faught
in
this
situation,
justice
scalia,
the
only
explanation,
the
only
thing
that
the
secretary
has
done
that
places
the
requirement
she
is
seeking
to
impose
here
in
this
regulation,
is
the
arguments
of
her
counsel
and
the
compliance
officer
writing.
it
is
not
in
the
standard
itself.
it
is
like...
it's
imposing
a
new
requirement
that
is
not
there.
and
i
view
that
virtually
the
same
as
what
was
happening
in
bowen,
is
that
the
secretary
came
into
litigation
and
explained...
tried
to
explain...
a
basis
for
retroactively
applying
the
regulation.
and
this
court
rejected
it.
it
said
no,
we
won't
accept
your
explanation
when
it
is
not
the
basis
for
the
regulation.
in
addition
to
bowen,
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
to
be
entitled
to
controlling
weight
an
agency
must
act
in
the
forum
that
is
delegated
by
congress.
in
batterton
the
court
distinguished
between
deference
and
the
kinds
of
weights
that
i
have
been
talking
about
here.
in
batterton
the
court
said
if
it's
a
delegated
authority,
it's
entitled
to
controlling
weight.
if
it's
something
less
than
delegated
authority,
it
may
be
entitled
to
weight,
but
it's
a
different
weight.
i
referred
previously
to
the
recommendation
of
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states.
the
administrative
conference
considered
precisely
this
issue
inn
1989,
and
in
july
of
1989
issued
a
recommendation
that
says
in
order
for
an
agency
to
be
entitled
to
controlling
weight
under
chevron
it
should
act
in
a
rule-making
power,
a
formal
adjudication,
or
in
some
other
forum
delegated
by
congress.
if
the
agency
has
not
acted
in
that
forum,
it
is
not
entitled
to
controlling
weight.
and
that
precisely
is
what
the
case
is
here.
mr.
john
d.
faught
it
would
depend
on
the
forum,
justice
white.
mr.
john
d.
faught
the
national
labor
relations
board
was
carrying
out
its
delegated
authority
from
congress
to
adjudicate
cases.
in
that
adjudication
it
said
what
the
act
meant?
yes,
it's
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
mr.
john
d.
faught
issued
a--
mr.
john
d.
faught
--they
have
been
given
adjudicatory
authority
by
congress,
just
the
same
as
the
commission
here.
mr.
john
d.
faught
the
difference
here,
justice
white,
is
that
congress
has
separated
the
functions.
congress
took
the
adjudicatory
power
from
the
secretary,
and
all
that
that
entails,
took
that
from
the
secretary
and
placed
it
in
the
commission.
so
in
this
case
you
have
a
split,
split
agency.
you
have
split
powers,
that
the
secretary
can
operate
through
the
rule-making
power,
and
the
commission
can
operate
through
the
adjudicatory
power.
they
both
have
a
policy-making
function.
the
secretary's
policy-making
function
is
exercised
through
making
rules.
the
commission's
policy-making
function
is
exercised
through
adjudications.
and
as
justice
scalia
noted
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
bowen,
is
that
a
rule...
or
excuse
me,
an
order
based
on
adjudication
is
to
determine
what
the
law
was.
that
is
precisely
what
the
commission
did
here.
it
determined
what
the
law
was.
it
interpreted
what
the
standard
meant.
that's
its...
that's
its
function
under
the
act,
and
that
is
why
it
should
receive
controlling
weight.
what
the
secretary
is
trying
to
do
here
is
raise
the
same
questions
that
were
raised
before
congress
in
1970
and
were
rejected.
the
secretary
is
saying
i
want
that
power.
i
want
all
the
policy
power.
the
commission
does
not
have
any
policy
power
in
its
adjudication.
that
is
not
what
congress
intended,
and
that
is
not
what
congress
said.
what
congress
said,
we
are
concerned,
we
will
not,
and
we
refuse
to
place
all
the
power
in
the
secretary.
we
are
going
to
give
the
adjudicatory
power
to
the
commission.
and
that's...
that's
what
the
secretary
is
trying
to
take
back
today.
and
she's
trying
to
take
it
back,
not
in
a
formal
rule-making
proceeding,
she's
trying
to
take
it
back
through
the
issuance
of
a
compliance
order,
or
an
order
by
a
compliance
officer.
he
is
one
of
a
thousand
compliance
officers.
he
issues
it
and
says
this
is
my
interpretation,
this
is
what
the
standard
means.
and
now
the
secretary
is
bolstering
it
in
court
by
her
arguments
of
counsel.
that
is
not
the
way
she
is
to
operate;
that
is
not
the
delegated
authority
by
congress.
she
is
to
exercise
her
policy
power
through
making
rules.
she
did
make
a
standard
in
this
case,
but
it's
ambiguous.
it
didn't
say
what
was
intended.
therefore
she
tries
to
explain
it
by
other
means.
this
court
should
reject
that
explanation.
it
is
not
entitled
to
controlling
weight
under
chevron.
the
secretary
should
not
be
allowed
to
circumvent
the
procedural
requirements
that
congress
set
out
for
her
to
exercise
her
rule-making
authority.
and
therefore
we
think
the
judgment,
or
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
it
was
correct
when
it
said
it
would
look
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
final
order
of
the
commission.
that
final
order
was
reasonable,
and
therefore
was
entitled
to
controlling
weight
and
entitled
to
deference
over
the
litigation
positions
of
the
secretary.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
chief
justice.
