mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970.
in
that
act
congress
established
a
comprehensive
regime
for
occupational
safety
and
health.
congress
gave
the
secretary
of
labor
the
authority
to
set
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
through
issuing
regulations,
and
he
gave
the
secretary
the
authority
to
administer
the
program
through
a
variety
of
means,
including
inspecting
businesses
and
issuing
citations
for
violations
of
the
statute
or
regulations.
at
the
same
time
congress
created
the
occupational
safety
and
health
review
commission.
its
sole
function
is
to
hear
challenges
to
the
citations.
the
commission's
decisions,
in
turn,
are
reviewable
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether,
when
the
secretary
and
the
commission
disagree
about
the
meaning
of
the
secretary's
regulations,
deference
should
be
given
to
the
secretary
or
to
the
commission.
we
believe
that
deference
should
be
given
to
the
secretary
because
congress
gave
the
secretary
the
authority
to
make
policy
through
issuing
regulations
and
administering
the
program,
and
the
ability
to
provide
reasonable
interpretations
of
those
regulations
is
an
aspect
of
that
policy-making
authority.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
it
does,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
the
commission
failed
to
give
proper
deference
to
the
secretary's
position.
for
the
reviewing
court,
we
believe
that
the
question
should
be
the
same
as
for
the
commission,
which
is
whether
the
secretary's
interpretation
was
reasonable.
and
so
therefore
the
reviewing
court
should
just
address
that
question
directly,
considering
carefully
the
commission's
opinion
and
the
light
that
it
can
shed
on
that
issue,
but
basically
facing
the
same
question
that
the
commission
was
facing.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
regulation
that
was
relied
on
was
perfectly
appropriate.
the
particular
provision
is
a
training
provision,
but
it
has
a
fitting
component.
it
specifically
refers
to
respirators
being
fitted
properly,
and
it's
important--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
in
terms
of
some
of
the
objections
that
have
been
raised
to
it,
those
objections
would
not
be
present.
but
let
me
address
the
separate
fit
provision
in
its
context.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
part
of
the
reason--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--two...
there
are
two
reasons.
one
has
to
do
with
(g)(4)(i),
and
one
has
to
do
with
(g)(3),
which
is
what
incorporates
the
general
respirator
provision
of
section
134.
taking
(g)(4)(i)
first,
what
remains
of
that
provision
is
a
vestige
of
the
original
provision.
it
was
initially,
as
promulgated
by
the
secretary,
an
entirely
different
provision.
the
sentence
that
is
there
now,
which
has
the
language
134,
"fitted
properly",
that
initially
was
followed
by
a
specific
quantitative
fit
requirement
which
is
very
different
from
the
qualitative
fit
test
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
banana
oil
test
where
an
employee
puts
on
a
respirator
and
is
asked
if
he
can
detect
the
smell
of
the
banana
oil.
that's
a
qualitative
fit
test.
a
quantitative
fit
test
actually
measures
on
a
quantitative
basis
the
exposure
that
the
respirator
is
allowing.
initially
(g)(4)(i)
included
a
quantitative
fit
provision.
the
"fitted
properly"
sentence
was
the
first
sentence,
and
it
then
went
on
to
the
quantitative
fit
provision.
the
quantitative
fit
requirement
was
invalidated
in
the
course
of
litigation
within
the
year
and
a
half
previously
to
this
inspection
here,
which
was
in
august
1979.
that
had
been
invalidated
in
1978.
now,
the
first
sentence
of
(g)(4)(i)
ultimately,
when
the
secretary
corrected
the
regulation,
kept
the
first
sentence,
but
it
was
a
very
different
provision
from
the
one
that
had
initially
been
there.
and
so
that's,
in
terms
of
the
context
on
(g)(4)(i)--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--at
the
time--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct.
at
the
time--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--okay,
and
that
gets
to
the
second...
that
gets
to
the
second
question,
the
second
part
of
the
question.
the
second
part
of
the
question
has
to
do
with
(g)(3)
in
section
134
and
its
scope.
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
section
(g)(3),
applies,
and
there
is
no
separate
fit
provision
as
in
(g)(4)(i).
it
applies
of
its
own
force
in
many
circumstances,
and
it
applies,
sometimes
when
it's
incorporated
in
another
regulation,
without
a
sentence
as
is
now
in
(g)(4)(i).
in
those
circumstances
the
secretary
has
consistently
interpreted
section
134
to
impose
a
fit
requirement,
and
if
the
conclusion
that
section
134
does
not
impose
a
fit
requirement
because
of
the
existence
of
this
separate
fit
provision
in
(g)(4)(i),
would
strip
the
regulation
of
an
essential
part
of
its
meaning,
in
the
secretary's
view,
in
those
other
contexts,
even
though
the
predicate
for
doing
so,
the
separate
fit
provision,
is
not...
is
not
there.
and
the
reason
that
i'm
going
into
this
background
is
to
say
that
section
134,
which
is
incorporated,
has
a
broad
applicability,
and
this
is
the
standard
way
that
it
has
been
interpreted.
it
has
been
interpreted
to
include
that
fitting
component.
the
reason
i
went
into
the
background
on
(g)(4)(i)
is
that
although
the
shorter
version
remained
in
effect,
it
had
been
primarily
viewed
as
the
quantitative
fit
requirement,
and
it
had
been
viewed
that
(g)(3),
which
incorporated
section
134,
imposed,
among
other
things,
a
requirement
that,
as
the
regulations
state,
the
employee
had
an
opportunity
to
have
the
respirator
fitted
properly,
and
have
an
opportunity
to
have
the
respirator
in
a
test
atmosphere.
and
so
it
was
a
perfectly
valid
interpretation.
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
it
was
only
covered
by
(g)(4)(i),
and
in
fact
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
way
section
134
had
been
interpreted
in
a
wide
variety
of
other
contexts.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
regulations,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
okay.
section
134
is
at
page
115...
i'm
sorry,
section
134(e)(5)
is
at
page
115a
of
the
petition...
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
1029(g),
both
(3)
and
(4)
is
on
page
122a.
in
(g)(4)(i),
what
is
left
is
one
sentence.
there
was
initially
another
sentence
which
imposed
the
quantitative
fit
requirement
which
has
been
deleted
from
the
current
regulation
and
is
not
reproduced
here.
so
what
is
here
is
the
vestige
that
remained
after
the
invalidation
of
the
earlier
provision,
after
the
invalidation
of
the
quantitative
fit
requirement--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
one
of
the
regulations
that
has
been
discussed
in
the
opinions
initially
had
a
different
form
than
it
is
here.
in
terms
of
its
applicability
and
in
terms
of
its
current
state,
it
is
in
the
form
that
it
was
reproduced
on
page
122a.
so
this
is
the
current
regulation,
and
this
is
the
regulation
that
was
effective
at
the
time
of
the
inspection.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
as
a
clerical
matter,
the
second
sentence
wasn't
deleted
until
somewhat
later,
but
this
is
what
was
in
effect
at
the
time.
i
should
point
out
that
these
questions
about
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
are
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
address,
because
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view
it
was
sufficient
to
defer
to
the
commission's
interpretation.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view
in
cases
of
conflict
between
the
secretary
and
the
commission,
if
it
determines
that
the
regulation
is
ambiguous,
it
defers
to
the
commission
if
it
finds
that
the
commission's
view
is
reasonable.
so
the
court
found
that
the
regulation
was
ambiguous,
found
that
the
commission's
interpretation
was
reasonable,
and
never
explicitly
addressed
the
reasonableness
or
not
of
the
secretary's
interpretation.
that
is
exactly
the
question
that
we
think
should
have
been
addressed
by
the
court
and
was
not.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
we
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
send
the
case
back
to
address
the
reasonableness
after
clarifying
the
threshold
question
which
has
divided
the
courts
of
appeals,
which
is
whether
deference
should
be
given
to
the
secretary
or
to
the
commission.
and
we
think
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
the
question
it
would
be
appropriate
to
send
it
back
to
consider
it
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
no,
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
because
(e)(5)
includes
the
language
that
the
employee
must
have
an
opportunity
to
have
the
respirator
fitted
properly.
and
if...
and
it
also
includes
the
language
about
a
test
atmosphere.
and
what
the
secretary
said
is
that
this
imposes
two
requirements.
it
imposes
a
requirement
that
the
employee
be
exposed
in
a
test
atmosphere,
and
secondly,
that
if
the
test
results
show
that
the
respirator
does
not
fit,
the
employer
must
do
something
about
it,
must
give
the
employee
a
respirator
that
does
fit.
that's
the
meaning
of
fitted
properly.
what
the
commission
said,
and
its
view
was
that
the
regulation
required
only
the
first
of
those.
it
does
require
the
employer
to
put
the
employee
in
a
test
atmosphere,
but
it
then
leaves
the
employer
entirely
free
to
ignore
the
test
results
and
to
send
the
worker
back
into
the
work
environment
with
the
respirator
after
getting
results
indicating
that
the
respirator
does
not
fit.
and
in
this
particular
case
there
not
only
is
the
language
of
the
regulation,
but
there
is
the
fact
that
respondent
had
actual
notice
that
this
was
the
secretary's
interpretation,
as
is
stated
in
the
commission's
decision
and
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision.
the
secretary's
compliance
officer
explained
to
the
respondent
that
the
respirators
had
to
be
fitted
with
banana
oil
or
another
kind
of
test
atmosphere,
and
respondent
revealed
this
understanding
in
its
own
training
films
by
saying
to
its
workers
that
if
a
test
indicated
that
its
respirators
did
not
fit
properly,
it
would
be
provided...
the
employees
would
be
provided
with
a
respirator
that
did
fit.
yet
despite
this
actual
notice,
respondent
was
not
doing
this,
the
secretary's
compliance
officer
discovered,
on
this
inspection.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
we
agree
that
that
should
be
the
primary...
that
that
should
be
the
first
question
that
the
court
looks
at,
and
that
was
a
serious
error
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
it
would
be
our
view
that
if
a
court
determines
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
reasonable,
then
it
should
be
upheld.
and
i
suppose
there
could
be
a
view
that
if
the
secretary's
interpretation
was
reasonable,
that
then
raised
other
questions
of
deference.
but
that
is
exactly
the
question
that
we
think
the
court
should
address,
and
that
it--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
what
i
was
trying
to
say
in
my
response
to
justice
souter
is
that
we
believe
that
a
proper
analysis
of
the
issue
would
be
to
recognize
first
that
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
deference,
which
means
that
the
secretary's
reasonable
interpretation
should
be
upheld.
and
so
therefore
the
first
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
address
is
is
the
secretary's
interpretation
reasonable.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right,
chief
justice.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
you
don't
defer
to
something
that's
unreasonable,
i
agree
with
that.
and
respondent
has
urged
this
court
to
hold
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
unreasonable.
and
if
the
court--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
in
terms
of
the
question,
it
is
related
to
the
question
of
deference,
your
honor,
because
if
in
fact
the
commission
should
receive
deference
in
its
reasonable
interpretations,
then,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
there
is
no
reason
to
consider
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
interpretation.
there's
an
important
legal
question
at
stake
here
which
has
splintered
the
courts
of
appeals,
which
is
what
are
they
supposed
to
do,
how
are
they
supposed
to
approach
the
issue
when
the
secretary
and
the
commission
disagree.
and
it,
it's
our
view
that
the
secretary's
reasonable
interpretation
should
receive
deference.
and
once
that
principle
of
law
is
clarified--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--of
the
secretary's
interpretation.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well...
i
think
that's
correct,
the
court
does
not
have
to
get
mixed
up
in
the
reasonableness
issue
if
it
clarifies
the
general
legal
principle
that
has
divided
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
reason
why
i
think
that
the
threshold
question
should
be
which
entity
receives
deference,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
say
anything
contrary
to
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--the
reason
why
i
think
that
the
identity
of
the
entity
that
should
receive
deference
is
the
threshold
question
is
because
that
is
the
legal
rule
that
then
structures
the
court's
analysis
in
its
case-by-case
consideration
of
these
cases,
and
that's
exactly
the
issue
that
has
generated
the--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
it
is...
the
question
presented
arises
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
if
there,
if
there
is
no
ambiguity
there
is
no
question
of
deference
presented.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point
in
focusing
on
what
the
issue
in
this
case
is
and
what
exactly
is
at
stake,
because
we
completely
agree
with
respondent
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
should
be
set
aside
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
regulation
or
with
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation.
and
we
also
completely
agree
with
respondent
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
should
be
set
aside
if
it
is
unreasonable.
the
only
category
of
cases
that
is
affected
by
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
category
of
cases
in
which
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
reasonable
and
would
be
found
to
be
so
by
the
reviewing
court.
and
in
those
circumstances
we
believe
that
the
secretary's
reasonable
interpretation
should
be
upheld.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that
issue
would
bear
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
interpretation.
in
answer
to
your
question
whether
if
it
is
only
in
a
compliance
order
it
should
receive
deference,
we
would
say
that
it
should
receive
deference,
but
that
there
should
be
a
full
consideration
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
interpretation.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
would
be
a
prior
history
of
such
interpretations,
then
it
would
strengthen
the
case
for
the
reasonableness.
it
seems
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
they--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--when
that's
all
you
have,
which
is
the
hardest
question...
i
should
point
out
that
this
issue
encompasses
a
great
many
other
kinds
of
interpretations
by
the
secretary
which
aren't
as
hard
as
that
hardest
case.
but
in
that
hardest
case,
what
the
commission
and
the
court
should
do
is
to
see
whether
the
interpretation
that
is
reflected
in
that
interpretation...
i'm
sorry,
whether
the
interpretation
that
is
reflected
in
that
citation
is
reasonable.
now
you
have
certain
questions
in
those
circumstances
that
you
don't
have
if
the
secretary
has
previously
given
some
clarifying
interpretation,
even
though
not
in
a
regulation.
for
one
thing,
the
question--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--it
is
the
official
act.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
it
is.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--i
agree
that
it
should
be
upheld
if
it's
reasonable,
and
that's
why
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor
on
this
question
was
that
yes,
it
should,
it
should
get
deference.
in
terms
of
comparing
that
action
to
other
interpretations,
the
reason
why
i'm
saying
that
it
might
bear
unreasonableness
is
for
two
reasons.
one
reason
is
that
it
relates
to
the
question
of
notice.
if
the
interpretation
is
only
in
the
enforcement
action,
you
would
want
to
be
very
careful
that...
about
notice.
now,
normally
reasonableness
would
encompass
notice.
to
the
extent
that
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation,
you
would
think
that
an
employer
would
fairly
have
notice
of
it.
but
because,
if
that
is
the
only
place
that
it
is
appearing--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--i--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--i
agree
with
that.
and
if
that
interpretation
was
issued
3
weeks
before
a
citation,
then,
and
then
you
had
a
citation
reflecting
that
interpretation,
then
the
only
question
would
be
the
reasonableness
of
the
black
means
white.
but
you
wouldn't
have
a
question
about
notice.
in
the
case
where
it's
only
in
a
citation,
you
have
exactly
the
same
reasonableness
inquiry,
but
you
have
an
additional
question,
which
you
don't
have
in
the
other
case,
which
is
a
question
of
notice,
which
you
would
want
to
be
careful
about.
and
in
terms
of
notice
it's
important,
and
the
role
of
the
commission
in
terms
of
what
it's
supposed
to
do
in
that
circumstance,
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
addition
to
the
adjudication
of
the
challenge
itself,
a
very
important
role
that
the
commission
plays
and
that
it
gets
deference
on
is
the
establishment
of
the
penalty
and
of
the
category
of
violation.
in
terms
of
the
penalty,
the...
there
are
four
factors
that
the
commission
can
consider
in
determining
the
appropriate
penalty,
and
in
some
cases
in
eliminating
a
penalty
altogether,
and
those
are
the
size
of
the
business,
the
gravity
of
the
violation,
the
good
faith
of
the
employer,
and
the
previous
history
of
violations
of
the
employer.
and
in
those
kinds
of
factual
discretionary
determinations
the
commission
gets
substantial
deference,
and
it
is
the
commission
rather
than
the
secretary
that
is
entitled
to
deference
on
those
questions.
and
so
even
if
you
have
a
situation
where
an
employer
has
received
notice
through
a
reasonable
interpretation,
but
somehow
still
was
in
good
faith,
then
in
those
circumstances
the
commission
can
still
exercise
its
important
role
of
adjudication
by
taking
that
subjective
good
faith
into
account
in
the
assessment
of
penalties.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
they
are.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
just
a
few
brief
points,
your
honor.
first,
respondent
places
great
weight
repeatedly
on
the
phrase
"controlling
weight"
as
a
decisive
factor
here.
respondent
fails
to
point
out
that
in
this
court's
consistent
decisions
on
an
entity's
interpretations
of
its
own
regulations,
which
almost
by
definition
are
not
embodied
in
the
regulation,
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
those
interpretations
are
entitled
to
controlling
weight
unless
plainly
erroneous
or
inconsistent
with
the
regulation.
that
has
been
the
settled
standard
that
the
court
has
applied
in
this
category
of
cases.
secondly,
respondent
contends
that
the
commission
was
given
a
policy-making
function,
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history.
the
contrast
between
the
commission's
role
and
the
role
of
the
nlrb
or
the
federal
trade
commission
could
not
be
more
stark,
for
those
entities
are
specifically
given
policy-making
authority.
and,
as
this
court
has
held
in
cases
like
chenery
and
bell
aerospace,
the
reason
that
those
entities
can
announce
policies
in
the
course
of
adjudication
is
precisely
because
they
have
the
choice
of
making
that
policy
in
other
means.
they
have
been
given
the
policy-making
authority,
and
it
is
that
that
the
commission
lacks
here.
third,
in
terms
of
just
the
context
of
this
case,
the
second
very
case-specific
issue
that
respondent
repeatedly
talks
about,
it
is
not
true
that
the
only
evidence
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
embodied
in
the
citation
in
this
case.
even
if
it
were,
it
would
be
entitled
to
deference.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief,
in
january
of
1979
the
secretary,
in
the
industrial
hygiene
field
operations
manual,
had
said
in
interpreting
this
provision
that
respirators
must
fit
properly,
and
in
subsequent
interpretation
in
april
of
1979,
which
is
exhibit
c(11)
before
the
administrative
law
judge,
at
page
2,
the
secretary
again
said...
referred
to
this
specific
provision
as
a
training
and
fitting
standard.
in
1980
the
secretary
issued
another
instruction,
and
that
has
consistently
been
the
secretary's
interpretation
with
respect
to
whether
a
fit
requirement
is
imposed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
