chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sloan,
where
in
your
brief
or
in
the
petition
are
these
various
sections
set
out?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
you
have
just
been
talking
to
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
and
justice
blackmun's
questions.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is...
one
of
the
regulations
that
the
secretary
relied
on
is
not
reproduced?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
question
you
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
present
the
question
of
should
the
secretary's
view
receive
deference
rather
than
that
of
the
osha.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
should
address
rather
than
what
we
should
address.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
whatever
might
be
logically
prior
in
some
sort
of
theoretical
analysis,
one
question
is
presented
by
this
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
is
who
gets
deference.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sloan.
mr.
faught.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
just
read
bowen,
the
part
that
you're
interested
in,
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
court's
opinion
there
was
talking
about
kind
of
justifications
offered
for
a
regulation
in
the
course
of
litigation
sustaining
it.
the
quotation
being
that,
about
the
counsel
for
an
agency
offering
a
post-hope
justification
for
it.
that
really
isn't
the
case
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
faught.
mr.
sloan,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sloan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
