mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
claim
that
a
state
tax
violates
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
a
claim
that
is
cognizable
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
the
pertinent
part
of
section
1983
provides
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
legal
and
equitable
relief
against
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
statute
of
any
state
subjects
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
any...
to
the
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution.
in
this
case
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
upheld
petitioner's
claim
that
a
nebraska
truck
tax
that
he
was
required
to
pay
violated
the
commerce
clause
and
it
affirmed
a
permanent
injunction
that
the
trial
court
had
granted
the
petitioner
in
joining
respondents,
who
were
certain
state
tax
officials,
from
collecting
the
tax.
nevertheless,
the
court
rejected
petitioner's
claim
under
section
1983,
because
it
concluded
that
a
state
official's
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
did
not
deprive
petitioner
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution.
the
court
relied
mainly
on
the
1978
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
in
consolidated
freightways
v.
kassel,
which
held
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
establish
individual
rights
against
government
but
instead
allocates
powers
between
the
state
and
federal
governments.
the
conclusion
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
secure
individual
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
is,
i
submit,
squarely
at
odds
with
many
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it's
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
commerce
clause
itself
is
merely
a...
states
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
the
federal
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
but
it's
been
a
fundamental
precept
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
at
least
since
1851
when
it
decided
cooley
v.
board
of
wardens,
that
the
commerce
clause
in
addition
to
granting
power
to
the
federal
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
imposes
specific
obligations
and
restraints
upon
the
state
governments
of
its
own
force.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it's
true,
justice
kennedy,
that
they
can
be
raised
of
their
own
force.
but
that's
true
of
many
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
which
this
court
has
held
section
1983
applies
to.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
uh--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
think
the
answer
is
no.
but--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
carter
v.
greenhow
is,
is...
does
not
support
the
decision
below
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
was
a...
it
involved,
if
anything,
the
contracts
clause
and
not
the
commerce
clause.
but
second,
the
court
in
that
case,
contrary
to
what
respondents
have
argued,
did
not
hold
that
the
contracts
clause
does
not
secure
any
rights
under
the
constitution.
in
fact,
it
held
the
opposite.
it
said
that
the
contracts
clause
does
secure
rights
under
the
constitution.
but
what
it
specifically
held
was
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
not
asserted
that
violation
of
the
contracts
clause.
and
as
this
court
has
subsequently
noted
in
chapman
v.
houston
welfare
rights
organization
and
in
hague
v.
cio,
carter
v.
greenhow
was
really...
the
result
in
that
case
was
really
based
on
the
deficiencies
in
the
plaintiff's
pleading.
in
any
event
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
at
least
three
areas:
in
its
decisions
under
the
commerce
clause;
in
its
decisions
under
section
1983;
and
more
broadly
in
its
decisions
under
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
allocate
governmental
powers
but
which
this
court
has
held
also
secure
individual
protections
enforceable
by
individuals.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think
golden
state
transit,
your
honor,
squarely
supports
our
submission.
the...
in
that
case...
in
that
case
the
court
summarized
the
test
that
this
court
has
specifically
fashioned
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
right,
privilege,
or
immunity
that's
enforceable
under
section
1983.
it
identified
three
factors,
three
considerations,
that
are
relevant
to
that,
to
that
inquiry,
all
of
which
i
submit
support
the
conclusion
that
the
commerce
clause
creates
constitutional
rights.
first,
the
court
stated
in
deciding
whether
a
federal
right
has
been
violated
we've
considered
whether
the
provision
in
question
creates
obligations
binding
on
the
governmental
unit
or
rather
does
no
more
than
express
a
congressional
preference
for
certain
kinds
of
treatment.
second
it
stated
that
the
interest
that
the
plaintiff
asserts
must
not
be
too
vague
or
amorphous
to
be
beyond
the
competence
of
the
judiciary
to
enforce.
and
third,
the
court
has
said
we've
also
asked
whether
the
provision
in
question
was
intended
to
benefit
the
punitive
plaintiff.
under
these
criteria
i
submit
that
there
can
be
no
serious
question
that
the
commerce
clause
secures
rights,
privileges,
and
immunities
enforceable
under
section
1983.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
can
only
respectfully
disagree,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
there's
no
merit
to
the
suggestion
that
the
commerce
clause
was
not
intended
to
benefit
individuals.
but,
let
me
just...
go
through
these--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
it
is
true
that
the
commerce
clause
is
a
fundamental
structuring
provision
of
the
federal
constitution,
indeed,
may
have
been
one
of
the
principal
causes
for
the
federal
constitution,
and
it
allocates
governmental
powers.
but
that
is
not
to
say,
or
that
is
not
consistent...
inconsistent
with
the
proposition
that
it
was
also
intended
to
benefit
individuals.
in
fact,
the
proposition
that
the
commerce
clause...
the
contention
that
the
commerce
clause
was
not
designed
to
benefit
individuals
was
perhaps
the
most
dramatically
and
clearly
refuted
by
this
court's
decision
in
morgan
v.
virginia.
and
that
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
the
claim
of
an
interstate
bus
passenger
challenging
a
state
statute
requiring
segregation
on
interstate
buses
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
struck
down
that
statute,
and
it
rejected
the
claim
by
the
state
that
the
plaintiff
had
no
enforceable
rights
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
court
said
constitutional
protection
against
burden
on...
burdens
on
commerce
is
for
her
benefit.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
this
case,
unlike
gibbons
v.
ogden
is
a
dormant
commerce
clause
case.
in
this
case
gibbons
v.
ogden
really
went
off
on
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
this
is...
this
is
a
straight
dormant
commerce
clause
case.
but
the
court
in
case
after
case
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
has
upheld
the
rights
of
individuals
to
enforce
individual
personal
protections
under
the
commerce
clause.
and
perhaps
more
importantly
in
those
cases
the
court
has
used
the
term
rights
to
describe
the
protections
that
the
commerce
clause
gives.
for
example,
in
boston
stock
exchange
v.
state
tax
commission,
the
court
upheld
the
claim
of
certain
tax
commissions
that
a
new
york
statute
violated
the
commerce
clause,
and
it
rejected
the
contention
that
those...
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
entitled
to
raise
those
claims
by
saying
that
plaintiffs
are
asserting
their
right
under
the
commerce
clause
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
free
of
discriminatory
state
taxation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
can't
think
of
any,
your
honor.
the
respondents
and
the
court
below
attempt
to
analogize
the
commerce
clause
to
the
supremacy
clause,
which
of
course
this
court
last
term
in
golden
state
transit
said
was
not
itself
a,
a
source
of
rights
actionable
under
section
1983.
but
the
supremacy
clause
is
very
different
from
the
commerce
clause
or
really
from
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution.
supremacy
clause
is
merely
a
declaration
of
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
it
does
not
of
itself
impose
any
specific
restraints
or
obligations
on
the
states
or
on
the
federal
government.
the
commerce
clause
in
contrast
is
a
source
of
federal
rights
and
of...
and
of
specific
obligations
that
are
imposed
in
the
states.
and
indeed
in
this
very
case,
the
court
below
imposed
those
obligations
on
the
state
of
nebraska,
and
they
did
so
at
the
behest
of
petitioner
in
order
to
protect
his
interests.
it
is
i
submit
a
contradiction
in
terms
for
the
court
below
to
conclude
that
the
petitioner
has
an
enforceable
protection
and
yet
has
no
right.
but
again
i
think
the...
this
court's
decisions
that
perhaps
are
clearest
on
this
point
are
the
decisions
in
morgan
v.
virginia
and
mostly
clearly
refute
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
protect
individual
rights
are
morgan
v.
virginia,
boston
stock
exchange,
and
also
united
states
v.
guest.
in
united
states
v.
guest
the
court
upheld
an
indictment
under
the
criminal
counterpart
to
section
1983,
which
alleged
that
the
defendants
had
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
certain
black
citizens
to
travel
freely
to
and
from
the
state
of
georgia.
the
court
upheld
that
indictment
and
it
said
that
the
constitutional
right
to
travel
was
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
i
submit
that...
that
this
court
could
not
affirm
the
decision
below
without
effectively
overruling
all
of
those
decisions
or
at
least
calling
them
seriously
into
question.
now,
respondents
have
argued
that
those
cases
are
not
important
because
they
didn't
involve
section
1983
and
because
they
didn't
involve
the
precise
of
what
section
1983
means
by
rights,
privileges,
and
immunities.
but
there's
no
basis
for
the
supposition
that
section
1983
intended
the
words
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
to
have
any
different
meaning
from
their
commonly
understood
meaning
or
from
their
meaning
in
usage
in
other
context.
respondents
in
effect
would
have
this
court
employ
a
special
vocabulary
for
section
1983
that's
at
odds
with
its
ordinary
meaning.
as
i...
furthermore,
as
i've
said
respondents'
contention
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
secure
individual
rights
is
inconsistent
with
the
specific
test
that
this
court
fashioned
and
summarized
in
golden
state
transit
v.
los
angeles
for
determining
what
constitutes
a
right,
privilege,
or
immunity
enforceable
under
section
1983.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
could
not
have
been
brought
in
federal
court
under
federal
jurisdictional
statutes.
or
it
could
not
have
been
brought
into
federal
court
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
sought
an
injunction
against
the
state
tax
and
the
federal
tax
injunction
act
prohibits
federal
courts
from
entertaining
such
actions.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
second
of
all,
it
sought
monetary
relief
and
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
federal
courts
from
entertaining
such
actions.
so
as
a
factual
matter,
the
only
place
this
claim,
with
or
without
section
1983,
can
be
brought
is
in
section...
is
in
state
court--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--you
can,
yes,
you
can--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--if
there
was
a
state
regulation,
your
honor,
such
as
a
truck
tax...
a
truck
length
law
or
something,
you
could
have
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
now
without--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes,
you
could.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes.
the
same
is
true...
but
the
same...
i
think
the
point
that
i
would
stress
is
the
same
is
true
of
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
of
federal
statutes
this
court
has
held
are
enforceable
under
section
1983.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
indeed
this
court
has...
has
stated
that
in
davis
v.
passman.
the
court
said
the
essence
of
a
cause
of
action
is
the
ability
to
enforce
a
right.
again
it's
a
contradiction
in
terms.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think
what
they
say
is
that
if
it's
a
right
in
other
contexts,
it's
not
a
right
in
the
context
of
section
1983.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
justice
stevens,
they
are
persons
for
these
purposes.
in
will
v.
michigan
department
of
state
police--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--i
think
last
term
or
the
term
before,
the
court
held
that
states
themselves
were
not
persons
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
officers
acting
in
their
official
capacities
when
sued
for
monetary
relief.
but
the
court
in
footnote
10
of
that
opinion
made
the
clear
distinction
that
officials
sued
in
their
official
capacity
for
injunctive
relief
are
persons
who
are
subject
to
suit
under
section
1983.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that's
correct.
respondents
don't
deny
that...
going
back
to
the
golden
state
test--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
essentially
that's
correct.
it's
not
totally
superfluous
except
for
attorney's
fees
because
there
may
be
instances
in
which
the
state
officials
are
violating
constitutional
rights
in
bad
faith.
for
example,
if
state
officials
adopted
a
practice
of
harassing
people
coming
into
their
state
because
they
were
from
the
state
of
ohio,
because
they
didn't
like
ohio,
and
did
so
in
bad
faith
and
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
i
think
that
in
those
circumstances
someone
would
have
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
the
individuals.
but
in
this
case,
we've
not--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
--but
if
they're
acting
in
bad
faith
they
would
not
have
a
qualified
immunity.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
consideration
with
respect
to
the
issue
in
this
case
and
that's
an
important
reason
i
think
that
section
1983
needs
to
be
given
the
full
scope
that
its
language
suggests.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
was
strictly
commerce.
i
don't
know
why
they
left
it
out,
but
it
was
strictly
a
commerce
clause
case.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
respondents...
getting
back
to
the
golden
state
test...
the
respondents
don't
really
dispute
that
this...
the
commerce
clause
satisfies
at
least
the
first
two
considerations
in
golden
state
but
they
hang
their
argument
on
the
third
consideration,
which
they
claim
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
meet.
that
is,
that
it
has
a
intent...
it
allegedly
has
no
intent
to
benefit
individuals.
and
i
submit
that
that's
simply
not
true,
that
morgan
and
other
cases
indicate
that
it
does,
it
does
have
that
intent.
but
furthermore,
the,
the
dichotomy
that
the
respondents
and
the
court
below
seek
to
draw
between,
one
the
one
hand
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
to
allocate
government
powers
and
to
serve
national
and
broad
societal
interests,
and
on
the
other
hand
a
purpose
to
benefit
individuals
is
i
submit
a
false
dichotomy.
the
fact
that
a
constitutional
provision
my
allocate
powers
and
have
a
purpose
to
serve
broad
national
interest
does
not
mean
that
it
is...
does
not
also
intend
to
serve
and
secure
liberty
for
individuals.
and
in
fact
this
court
has
consistently
rejected
that
dichotomy
in
cases
involving
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
allocate
powers
among
the
branches
of
the
government.
and
perhaps
for
purposes
of
the
issue
in
this
case,
that
is,
the
question
whether
such
provisions
give
rise
to
individual
rights,
the
most
telling
decision
is
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
united
states
v.
munoz-flores
where
the
court
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
the
origination
clause,
which
requires
revenue
measures
to
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives...
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
that
clause
doesn't
involve
individual
rights.
the
court...
excuse
me...
the
court
specifically
stated
that
the
government's
contention
that
the
origination
clause
does
not
involve
individual
rights
is
erroneous
and
the
court
said
it
had...
it
has
repeatedly
upheld
provisions
separating...
in
separation
of
powers
cases,
repeatedly
upheld
the
claims
of
individuals
seeking
to
enforce
their
own
protections
based
on
those
provisions.
i'd
like
to
briefly
address
respondents'
contention
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
1983
supports
the
decision
below.
the
court
of...
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
made
no
reference
to
the
legislative
history.
respondents,
however,
have
relied
on
it
and
they've
relied
primarily
on
certain
remarks
of
representative
shellabarger
which
appear
to
draw
a
distinction
between
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
relate
to
the
division
of
powers
between
the
state
and
federal
government
and
provisions
which
secure
the
rights
of
individuals
within
the
states.
and
i
think
three
things
should
be
said
about
those
remarks.
first,
there's
nothing
in
those
remarks
that
indicate
that
congressman...
representative
shellabarger
was
expressing
any
view
about
the
scope
of
the
legislation
that
would
become
section
1983.
the
thrust
of
his
remarks
appeared
to
be
that
remedial
legislation
was
particularly
necessary
in
the
case
of
the
latter-type
provisions.
but
he
did
not
say
and
he
did
not
suggest
that
the
legislation
that
he
was
supporting
did
not
encompass
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and,
indeed,
the
absence
of
any
limiting
or
qualifying
language
refute
any
such
suggestion.
second,
it's
not
clear
what
provisions
congressman...
exactly
what
provisions
congressman
shellabarger
would
have
put
into
which
category.
the
examples
he
gave
of
power-providing
provisions
were
the
provisions
providing
that
the
states
shall
enter
into
no
treaties,
that
they
shall
not
coin
money
and
they
shall
not
emit
letters
of
credit.
the
examples
that
he
gave
of
the
latter-type
provisions
were
the
fugitive-from-justice
provision
of
the
constitution,
the
fugitive
slave
provision,
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
most
importantly,
nothing
in
his
remarks
made
any
reference
to
the
commerce
clause,
and
there's
simply
no
basis
for
the
supposition
that
congressman
shellabarger
would
have
concluded
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
did
not
create
rights
with
respect
to
individuals
as
between
individuals
and
the
states--
and,
in
fact,
this
court's
decisions...
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
establish
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
does
establish
rights
with
respect
to
individuals
as
between
them
and
the
states.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
they
would
have
standing
and
if
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
treaty
provision
gave
rise
to
section
1983,
cause
of
action,
i
think
that
would
be
a...
an
interesting
and
perhaps
difficult
question.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
certainly
more
difficult
than
this
one.
in
sum,
your
honor,
in
sum
the
section
1983
provides
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
the
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges,
and
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
without
any
limitation
or
qualification.
this
court's
decisions
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
coverage
of
section
1983
must
be
broadly
construed,
and
it
has
consistently
rejected
efforts
to
limit
the
scope
of
rights
that
are
covered
by
section
1983.
now
if
it
were
for
some
reason
appropriate
to
carve
out
the
commerce
clause
from
the
protections
that
section
1983
provides,
congress
is
free
to
do
so.
but
there's
simply
no
warrant
for
this
court
to
do
so
on
the
basis
respondents'
strained
and
unnatural
reading
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
contention
that
united
states
v.
guest
did
not
base
the
decision
there
on
the
commerce
clause.
that's
simply
incorrect.
guest
squarely
rested
the
violation,
the
alleged
violation,
of
the
identical
statutory
language
on
the
commerce
clause
at
383
u.s.
at
758
the
court
said,
in
edwards
v.
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
invalidating
a
california
law
which
impeded
the
free
interstate
passage
of
an
indigent,
the
court
based
its
reaffirmation
of
the
federal
right
of
interstate
travel
upon
the
commerce
clause.
this
ground
of
decision
was
consistent
with
precedents
firmly
establishing
that
the
federal
commerce
power
surely
encompasses
the
movement
in
interstate
commerce
of
persons
as
well
as
commodities.
and
for
that
reason
they
upheld
count
four
of
that
indictment.
second,
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
bowman
v.
chicago
northwestern
railroads
somehow
supports
petitioner,
that's
simply
incorrect.
again,
bowman
did
not...
did
not
hold
that
the
commerce
clause
did
not
secure
rights
under
the
constitution.
what
the
court
in
bowman
held
was
that
the
plaintiff's
claim
in
the
case
against
the
railroad
was
simply
a
state
law
claim.
in
other
words,
a
claim
that
the
railroad
was
obliged
by
the
state
law
of
common
carriage
to
carry
his
commodities,
and
that's
why
the
court
rejected
his
claim
and
found
that
it
did
not
fall
within
the
jurisdictional
statute.
and
an
interesting
contrast
of
bowman,
i
think,
is
a
case
around
the
same
period
which
is
one
of
the
early
cases
enforcing
the
dormant
commerce
clause
against
a
discriminatory
state
tax,
and
that's
guy
v.
baltimore
in
19...
in
1879.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
struck
down
a
baltimore
worthage
fee
that
was
imposed
only
on
ships
that
came
into
baltimore
carrying
out-of-state
commodities.
and
the
court
said
if
the
prohibition
against
discriminatory
taxation
were
not
in
the
commerce
clause,
"it
is
easy
to
perceive
how
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states
could
be
practically
annulled.
"
--and
this
is
the
important
part...
"and
the
equality
of
commercial
privileges
secured
by
the
federal
constitution
to
citizens
of
the
several
states
materially
abridged
and
impaired.
"
clearly
the
court
at
that
time
viewed
the
commerce
clause
as
securing
privileges
to
the
citizens
of
the
several
states.
reference
was
made
to
remarks
of
other
congressmen
and
particularly
congressman
hoar
during
the
debates
on
section...
on
1983.
if
you
read
congressman
hoar's
remarks,
basically
he
was
engaging
in
a
dissertation
on
the
constitution
and
explaining
how
there
were
different
types
of
provisions,
but
there's
nothing
in
his
remarks
that
suggest
that
he
understood
the
proposed
legislation
as
not
including
rights
under
the
commerce
clause.
finally
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
the
respondents'
argument
that
if
this
court
recognizes
that--
