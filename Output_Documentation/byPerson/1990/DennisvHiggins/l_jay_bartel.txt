mr.
l.
jay
bartel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
maintain
the
decision
below
was
correctly
decided
for
three
basic
reasons.
first,
under
the
test
set
forth
by
this
court
last
term
in
golden
state,
a
right
that's
secured
by
the
constitution
under
section
1983
only
where
the
constitutional
provision
at
issue
is
intended
to
benefit
the
plaintiff,
asserting
the
existence
of
a
right
actionable
under
section
1983.
second,
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause,
as
interpreted
and
applied
by
this
court,
demonstrates
the
clause
was
intended
to
allocate
power
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
in
order
to
preserve
the
national
interest
in
maintaining
political
and
economic
union,
the
clause
was
not
intended
to
benefit
individuals
or
participants
in
the
interstate
market
place
and
thus
secures
no
right
to
petitioner
actionable
under
section
1983.
third,
the
legislative
history
of
section
1983--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--certainly
there
are
causes
of
action
but
not
one
under
section
1983.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
in
state
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes,
petitioner
had
standing
to
raise
his
claim
in
state
court.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
he
received
declaratory
injunctive
relief,
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
yes,
he
received
prospective
injunction.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
he
has...
he
has
no
right
within
the
special
meaning
of
section
1983,
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution
under
this
test...
under
the
test
set
forth
by
the
court
in
golden
state.
in
golden
state
the
court
specifically
stated
that
one
of
the
standards
for
determining
whether
a
constitutional
provision
secures
a
right
within
the
meaning
of
that...
of
that
statute
is
that
the
provision
in
question
must
be
one
which
is
intended
to
benefit
the
plaintiff.
we
submit
the
commerce
clause
is
not
such
a
constitutional
provision.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983,
no.
there
is
a
distinction
there
that
we
need
to
make
between
a
general
version
or
a
general
understanding
of
a
right.
for
example,
a
right
to
bring
a
case
into
court
and
the
special
meaning
of
a
right
under
section
1983.
and
while
the
petitioner
seems
to
say
that
there
is
a
common
understanding
of
what
word
right
means
under
section
1983,
obviously
the
test
set
forth
in
golden
state
indicates
that
there
are
limitations
on
that
and
that
one
of
the
limitations
is
the
express
requirement
that
it
be
intended
to
benefit
the
plaintiff.
and
we
submit
the
commerce
clause,
if
that
is
the
basis
for
the
claim--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--certainly,
your
honor.
the
parties
here
agree
that
the
standard
to
be
employed
in
determining
whether
a
constitutional
provision
secures
a
right
under
section
1983
is
set
forth
in
the
court's
decision
in
golden
state.
the
disagreement
here
is
based
on
the
application
of
the
golden
state
standard
to
claims
of
violation
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
the
crucial
element
and
first
part
of
the
golden
state
test
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
commerce
clause
was
intended...
is
intended
to
benefit
the
plaintiff.
we
submit
the
ultimate
question
which
must
be...
to
answer
is
whether
dennis'
standing
to
sue
as
a
person
affected
by
a
state
law.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
the
history
and
background
of
the
commerce
clause
demonstrate
that
its
purpose
was
to
allocate
power
between
the
state
and
federal
governments.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
the
basis
for
the
commerce
clause
was
not
the
basis
of
conferring
benefits
on
individuals
per
se.
the
protections
to
be
afforded
by
the
commerce
clause
are
national
in
scope...
the
interests
of
preserving
national
interest
and
economic
unity.
the
historical
background
of
the
clause
was
obviously
to,
to
illuminate
the
type
of
commercial
warfare
and
economic
rivalries--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--it's
our
position
that
whatever
benefits
may
be
derived
to
individuals
as
a
result
of
the
existence
of
the
commerce
clause
and
the
dormant
commerce
clause
doctrine
are
merely
incidental
to
the
clause's
main
purpose,
that
purpose
being,
again,
to
preserve
the
national
interest
in
political
and
economic
union.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
that's
correct.
and
this
court's
decisions
have
in
commerce
clause
cases
confirmed
the
notion
that
the
interests
involved
in
being
resolved
in
those
cases
are
not
individual
interests
but
national
interests.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
it's
a
part
of
it
i
think,
your
honor,
because
it
indicates
that
perhaps
it
is
certainly
not...
whatever
they're
claiming
is
not...
is
certainly
subject
to
qualification.
congress
can
remove
it...
any
individual's
ability
to
act
entirely
or
it
can
give
the
states
the
authority
to
restrict
or
prohibit
and
enact
legislation
that
they
otherwise
could
not
do,
for
example,
under
application
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
but
the
key
focus
is,
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
several
decisions,
that
the
clause
itself
protects
only
the
interstate
marketplace
and
not
particular
participants
in
the
marketplace
or
firms
operating
in
commerce...
in
exxon
v.
maryland
and
minnesota
v.
cloverleaf
creamery.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
well,
as
you
indicated,
justice
kennedy,
in
questioning
counsel
here,
the
contracts
clause
in
carter
v.
greenhow
was
held
not
to
secure
right
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
it
was
not
rights
secured
by.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
perhaps
under
the
golden
state
test
of
intent
to
benefit
one
might
view
the
specific
nature
of
the
contracts
clause.
by
referencing
contracts
themselves,
it
seems
to...
an
argument
could
certainly
be
made
that
that
reference
relates
directly
to
perhaps
individual
rights
because
contracts
obviously
relate
to
the
rights
of
individuals,
vested
rights
there,
and
that
might
arguably
present
a
little
different
analysis
than
you
would.
but
clearly
the
commerce
clause
is
different,
much
different
than
the
contracts
clause
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
support
any
type
of
civil
notion.
it
is
an
allocation
clearly
in
distribution
of
powers
between
the
states
and
the
national
government.
so
the
clauses
really
are
different
in
nature
even
if
one
were
to
reexamine
carter.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
not
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
1983,
no.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
only
if
you
use
the
term
in
the
sense
that
perhaps
the
individuals--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--they
certainly
have
standing
to
in
essence
vindicate
the
national
interest
in
holding
that
kind
of
legislation
unconstitutional,
that's
correct.
but
it's
not
based
on
an
individual
right
secured
by
the
constitution
under
1983.
perhaps
i
think
the
distinction
was
recognized--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--well,
first
we
take
issue
with
petitioner's
assertion
that
the
decision
in
guest
was
based
strictly
on
the
commerce
clause.
we,
we
read
guest
as
not
being
specifically
based.
they're
basing
the
constitutional
right
to
travel
on
the
commerce
clause.
in
subsequent
opinions
of
the
court,
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
attorney
general
v.
soto-lopez,
the
court
has
declined
to
locate
the
right
to
travel
in
any
specific
provision
of
the
constitution.
furthermore,
we
think
there
is
a
distinction
that
should
be
drawn
between
petitioner's
alleged
right
to
engage
in
an
interstate
trade,
and
that's
an
interest
that
should
be
viewed
as
fundamentally
different
from
the
right
of...
the
personal
right
to
travel
at
issue
in
these
cases.
as
for
morgan...
we
view
morgan
as
simply
a
consistent
application
of
this
court
of
vindicating
a
national
interest
in
state
commerce
as
opposed
to
the
recognition
of
any
individual
right.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
well,
because
i
wanted
to
distinguish...
morgan
in
particular
i
think
since
they
rely
so
heavily
on
it
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
this
case
was
not
an
individual
right-type
case
at
all
and
that
the
actual
holding
in
the
case
was
based
solely
on
the
national
interest
served
by
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
there
stated
that
the
reason
the
statute
was
invalid
not
that
it
was
based
on
the
violation
of
individual
right
but
rather
because
the
statute
unduly
burdened
interstate
commerce
because
seating
arrangements
for
the
different
races
in
interstate
motor
travel
require
a
single
uniform
rule
to
protect
and
promote
national
travel.
again,
this
is
consistent
with
the...
consistent
recognition
by
the
court
that
the...
anything...
the
decision
in
commerce
clause
cases
is
not
based
on
an
individual
right,
rather
it
is
a
national
interest
being
vindicated.
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
court's
decisions.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
well,
of
course,
we're
dealing
here
with
section
1983--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--certainly,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
constitution
after
all
as
a
whole
was
designed
to
be--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--[inaudible]
nation
itself--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--but
it--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--well,
of
course
munoz-flores,
as
cited
by
petitioner
here,
involved
i
believe
the
origination
clause
and
the
precise
question
of
whether
the
person
there
had
a
right
to
bring
the
action.
that
of
course
revolves
on
a
consideration
of
separation
of
powers
in
that
instance.
now,
perhaps
because
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
was
primarily
designed
as
a
prevention
against
tyranny,
you
know,
for
individuals,
then
perhaps
the
government--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--certainly.
it
would
not
implicate
1983,
but
your
question
is
is
there
some
individual
right
nevertheless,
you
know,
obviously
outside
of
1983
because
it
involves
federal
action.
again,
to
give...
to
recognize
the
right
of
individuals
to
challenge
that
kind
of
an
action
is
based,
as
i
said,
on
probably
a
recognition
that
that
type
of
constitutional
protection,
separation
of
powers,
serves
a
very
important
function
in
the
prevention
of
tyranny
within
the
branches
of
government,
and
it
of
course
represents
a
concern
fundamentally
different
than
the
one
we're
raising
here
simply
is
the...
the
meaning
of
section
1983
again
as
set
forth
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
by
its
principal
sponsor
and
others
and
an
understanding
that
not
all
constitutional
provisions
were
covered
by
the
act's
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
language.
in
addition
to
representative
shellabarger,
who
i
think's
comments
are
highly
relevant,
we've
also
pointed
out
that
other
representatives
and
even...
and
senators
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
recognized
the
same
distinction
between
constitutional
provisions
that
serves
to
deal
with
the
relationship
between
individuals
and
the
states,
which
were
to
be
covered
by
the
act,
and
the
constitutional
provisions
recognizing
distinction
between
the
political
powers
between
the
states
and
the
general
government.
now,
clearly
it
would
appear
that
the
commerce
clause,
although
not
specifically
mentioned
by
representative
shellabarger,
falls
in
the
category
of
a
rights
or
a
power-allocating
provisions.
and
representative
hoar
specifically
mentioned
the
commerce
clause
in
his
comments
as
we
cited
in
your
brief
at
page
36
and
37
in
distinguishing
those
from
the
types
of
personal
rights
to
be
covered
by
the
1871
act.
senator
trumbull
recognized
the
same
distinction,
including
a
reference
to
interstate
commerce
being
a,
a
provision
dealing
with
national
authority
as
opposed
to
an
individual
rights-granting
provision.
we
do
not
think
that
legislative
history
should
be
lightly
dismissed
as
petitioner
would
ask
us
to
do
here.
in
addition
to
the
morgan
case
petitioner
has
also
relied
almost
heavily
on
boston
stock
exchange
v.
state
tax
commission.
we
submit
that
the
reference
in
boston
stock
exchange
to
a
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
it
is
included
within
a
discussion
of
the
standing
of
the
exchanges
to
bring
the
act
and
talks
about
the
adverse
effect,
injury
in
fact,
requirements
that
deal
simply
with
their
standing
to
bring
the
action.
and
if
you
look
at
the
decision
on
the
merits
you
will
see
that
the
actual
basis
for
the
court's
finding
the
tax
unconstitutional
in
that
case
is
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
focused
on
the
free-trade
purpose,
in
other
words
the
national
interest
served
by
the,
by
the
commerce
clause
and
not
the
recognition
of
any
individual
right
possessed
by
the
exchanges.
the
non-application
of
section
1983
to
claims
of
this
nature
we
think
is,
is
also
demonstrated
by
some
cases
decided
by
the
court
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
in
1871.
in
1885
again,
the
carter
v.
greenhow
case
in
which
the
court
distinguished
between
the
language
and
the
federal
question
statute,
the
broader
arising
under
the
constitution
language
as
opposed
to
the
more
limited
1983.
the
significance
of
that
i
think
is
that
it
recognized
that
shortly
after
the
act
that
not
all
constitutional
violations
were
intended
to
be
within
the
scope
of
section
1983.
again,
bowman
v.
chicago
and
northwestern
railway
company,
another
1885
decision,
involved
the
claim
on
commerce
clause
grounds
that
a
state
statute
restricting
interstate
delivery
liquor
violated
the
plaintiff's
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
the
court
there
indicated
that
while
that
claim
may
be
one
arising
under
the
constitution,
it
did
not
state
a
claim
for
the
deprivation
of
any
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
we
believe
that
there
are
additional
considerations
that
would
militate
against
the
court's
expanding
section
1983
to
commerce
clause
litigation.
the
major
impact
of
section
1983
here
would
be
simply
to
permit
a
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees.
when
congress
enacted
the
attorney
fee
statute
in
1976
to
ensure
effective
access
to
the
courts,
we
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
commerce
clause
litigation
was
among
the
type
of
cases
that
congress
was
concerned
was
being
denied
effective
access
to
the
courts,
given
the
long
history
of
commerce
clause
litigation
in
the
country.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
well,
again
the
basic
premise
is
that--
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
--you're
saying
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause?
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
the
purpose
we
think
indicates
that
under
the
golden
state
test
that
the
constitutional
provision
which
they
claim
secures
their
right
here
was
not
intended
to
confirm
the
type
of
specific
benefit
on
individuals
participating
in
the
marketplace
recognizing
under
section
1983.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
certainly,
and
individuals
have
throughout
the
history
of
the
nation...
have
done
so.
mr.
l.
jay
bartel
and
that
indeed
in
this
case,
the
courts
of
nebraska
were
open
to
them.
it
was
not
a
situation
where
they
were
being
denied
their
remedy.
the
question
was
whether
their
cause
of
action
would
be
one
under
section
1983
or
whether
they
would
have
to
pursue
their
remedy
under
some
other
claim.
we've
also
suggested
to
the
court
that
if
it
should
find
that
claims
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
are
actionable
under
section
1983
that
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
because
we
feel
that
the
implications
of
the
tax
injunction
act
have
not
been
addressed
here
and
that
they
should
be
because
they
indicate
that
perhaps
congress
has
established
an
alternative
remedial
scheme
which
has
precluded
availability
of
sections
1983
and
1988
in
this
particular
class
of
cases.
in
1987
the
court
in
arkansas
writers'
project
v.
ragland
indicated
that
the
question
of
whether
state
courts
must
entertain
section
1983
claims
and
state
tax
challenges
had
not
been
decided.
and
3
years...
2
years
prior
to
that
in
spencer
v.
south
carolina
tax
commission
the
court
had
affirmed
on
a
4-4
vote
without
opinion
that
a
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
which
denied
attorneys'
fees
in
a
claim
in
a
state
tax
case
based
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
we
submit
that
perhaps
that
in
the
event
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983
here,
that
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
to
address
the
effect
of
the
impact
of
section
1983
and
1988
in
a
state
tax
challenge.
if
there
are
not
further
question,
i
have
no
argument.
