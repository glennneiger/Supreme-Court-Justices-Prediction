unknown
speaker
well,
there's
language
in
decisions
that
talk
about
individuals
benefiting
from
it
as
indeed
they
do,
of
course,
by
the
court's
application
of
it.
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
find
in
the
language
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
we
call
the
commerce
clause
any
intent
to
benefit
individuals
in
any
direct
sense?
wouldn't
you
acknowledge
that?
unknown
speaker
which
can
be
raised
without
the
benefit
of
1983
which
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
of
cooley
v.
board
of
wardens.
unknown
speaker
well,
have
we
ever
held
that
1983
applies
to
any
constitutional
provision
other
than
the
reconstruction
amendments
in
the
bill
of
rights?
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
unknown
speaker
in
carter
v....
the
carter
v.
greenhow
contracts
clause
case
would,
would
be
contrary
to
your
position
on
this
point,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
implications
of
golden
state
transit
are
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
last
inquiry
raises
a
very
credible
inquiry
in
my
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
it,
didn't
it
really
go
to
the
structure
of
government
and
the
authority
to
be
given
to
the
new
federal
government
and
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
that
made
up
the
union.
do
you
really
think
that
it
gives
any
evidence
of
an
intent
to
directly
benefit
individuals?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
analytically...
is
the
case
any
different
for
commerce
clause
purposes
than
gibbons
v.
ogden?
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory
is
there
any
violation
of
the
constitution
by
a
state
actor
that
does
not
give
rise
to
a
1983
suit?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
claim
in
this
case
that,
that,
that
this
action
could
not
have
been
brought
under
ordinary
jurisdictional
provisions?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
tax...
suppose
a
state
tax
weren't
at
issue
and
suppose
only
an
injunction
is
sought,
you
can
bring
a
federal
question
suit
in
them--
unknown
speaker
--and
claiming...
claiming
that
there's
been
a--
unknown
speaker
--and
rely
on
the
dormant
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
and
get
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
could
get
an
injunction
in
such
a
federal
question
case,
i
suppose
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
you
have
a
right
to
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
but
i
don't
suppose
any...
the
other
side
doesn't
disagree
with
that,
do
they?
or
do
they
say
it's
no
right,
it's
just
a
standing
question?
unknown
speaker
okay.
mr.
allen,
help
me
on
something
i
don't
quite
understand.
you
could
not
have
brought
this
action
into
federal
court
because
the
defendants
are
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
are
not
those
defendants
held
not
to
be
persons
within
the
meaning
of
1983
for
that
reason?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
or
officers
acting
in
their
official
capacities.
unknown
speaker
so
insofar
as
you
sought
monetary
relief
it
clearly
is
not
a
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
claiming
the
injunctive
aspect
is
the
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
let
me
pursue
that
one
step
further.
do
you
think
that
the
tax
injunction
act
modifies
1983
in
any
respect?
is
it
possible
if
you
construed
those
two
cases...
two
statutes
together,
you'd
say,
well,
you
can't
get
monetary
relief
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
you
also
should
not
construe
1983
to
authorize
equitable
relief
in
federal
court
at
least
by
virtue
of
the
tax
injunction
act?
i
suppose
that
would
be
true,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
then
there's
this
very
narrow
area
that
1983
provides
a
cause
of
action
in
state
court
only
even
though
if
you're
right
on
the
merits
you
clearly
have
a
state
remedy
and
it's
1983
action
is
totally
superfluous
except
for
the
provision
for
attorneys'
fees,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
not
if
their
state
acting
in...
well,
i
see
what
you're...
yeah.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
need
the
commerce
clause
in
that
situation
if
they
were...
if
they
were
using
state
law
to
exclude
people
in
bad
faith
without
any
good
state
reason
for
it,
you'd
have
a
cause
of
action,
i
would
assume
anyway,
without
the
commerce
clause,
wouldn't
you?
once
you
posit
bad
faith,
which
is
what
makes
them
not
state...
not
states
being
sued
for
damages.
i
think
i
can...
justice
scalia,
i
think
one
could
conceive
of
a
circumstance
where
such
discrimination
might
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
but
yet
be
a
bad
faith
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
for
instance,
this
court
has
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
prohibit
retaliatory
state
actions,
but
the
commerce
clause
i
think
clearly
does
as
all
the
cases
have
held.
well,
in
the
morgan
case
they
deliberately
left
out
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
wasn't
in
there
at
all.
it
strictly
commerce
clause.
unknown
speaker
ask
me
sometime,
i'll
tell
you.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
thing
in
a
sense
about
the
treaty
clause.
conceivably
an
individual
could
challenge
an
agreement
that
was
made,
say,
between
the
state
of
california
and
mexico
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
actually
a
treaty
that
needed
to
be
approved
by
congress
and
they
were
trying
to
do
some
of
this
person
under
the
treaty.
they,
they
would
at
least
have
standing
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
more
difficult
than
this
one
you
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
allen.
mr.
bartel,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
xxx
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
a
cause
of
action
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
not
only
raised
it,
they...
he
won
on
that
claim.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
did
he
get
an
injunction
against
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
that
he...
but
he
has
no
right...
he
had
no
right.
what
was
he
just
a
private
attorney
general
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
if
they've
been
paying
illegal...
what
they
claim
to
be
illegal
taxes
and
the
state
courts
said,
yes,
the
statutes...
those
taxes
are
unconstitutional
and
the
question
then
might
be
about
a
refund.
and
suppose
the
state
court
says,
yeah,
you
can
get
a
refund
of
past
taxes.
still
no
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartel,
why
don't
you
slow
down
just
a
little
bit.
i
think
we
could
understand
you
a
bit.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just...
may
i
just
interrupt.
are
you
saying...
obviously
back
at
the
time
the
clause
was
drafted,
the
plaintiff
wasn't
around.
but
the
people
who
were
engaged
in
the
business
of
transporting
goods
and
people
across
state
lines
from
one
state
to
another,
you
say
that
the
interstate
commerce
clause
was
not
intended
to
benefit
people
engaged
in
that
sort
of
activity?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
you
were
talking
about
the
people
whom
it
was
intended
to
benefit.
and
aren't
these
the
very
quintessential
examples
of
people
who
are
intended
to
be
benefited
by,
by
having
interstate
commerce
free
of,
of
discriminatory
restrictions
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
saying
there
are
no
individuals
who
are
intended
to
be
benefited...
it
was
just
a
structural
provision
that
didn't
benefit
anyone
except
to
form
the
basis
for
the
way
the
government
was
put
together?
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
so
really
what
you're
saying
is
with
respect
to
the
first
of
the
three
points
you're
making...
i
don't
understand
some
that
you
want...
there
really
are
no
individual
businesses
or
persons
who
would
fit
the,
the
requirement
of
being
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
clause?
unknown
speaker
does
your
analysis
on
that
point
turn
on
the
proposition
that
congress
could
permit
the
states
to
regulate
if
it
chose?
is
that
what
makes
this
right
one
that's
it
not
a
right
given
directly
to
the
person?
unknown
speaker
and,
and
what
you
do
with
a
case
arising
out
of
a
contract
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
you
can
explain
the
case
away
as
a
pleaded
case
so
that
the
issue
came
back
before
us
to
know,
but
would
you
distinguish
between
the
commerce
clause
and
the
contract
clause?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
a
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
right
nevertheless.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
says...
says
no
imported
natural
gas
shall
be
allowed
in
this
state
and
the
people
who
are
excluded
sue
and
win.
do
you
think
they
had
a
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
explain
again
cases
like
united
states
v.
guest
and
morgan
which
speak
in
terms
of
individual
rights
and
purported
to
give
relief
at
least
for
a
violation
for
the
right
to
travel
that
the
court
said
was
covered
by
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
why
in
the
answer
you
gave
me
why
you
just
didn't
repeat
the
same
answer,
that's
just
not
the
kind
of
right
that
1983
is
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
right
conferred
upon
a,
a
businessman
to
be
free
from
predatory
practices
by
another
businessman?
is
that
a...
under
the
sherman
act...
is
that
an
individual
right
or
is
that
just
a
national
interest?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
i...
i'm...
i
don't
grasp
the
distinction.
you
draw
a
dichotomy
between
those
statutes
and
those
provisions
that
seek
to
prevent...
protect
private
interests
and
those
that
seek
to
protect
national
interests.
but
in
fact,
i
thought
every
time
congress
passes
a
statute
or
the
people
enact
a
constitutional
provision,
they're
not
doing
it
for
the
selfish
benefit
of
some
individuals.
isn't
there
a
national
interest
behind
every
right
that's
conferred?
i
mean,
you
always
have
some
further
good
government
objective
to
it,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
sure.
so...
so--
unknown
speaker
--the
commerce
clause
does
indeed
have
in
mind
free
travel
and
what
not,
but
in
order
to
assure
that
national
interest
it
gives
rights
to
particular
individuals
to
assert
the
right--
unknown
speaker
--just
as
the
sherman
act,
in
order
to
get
lower
prices
for
all
consumers,
gives
rights
to
businessmen
to
sue
for
predatory
practices.
but
the
critical
question
here
though
is
we're
dealing
with
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
passed
by
congress.
and
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
used
the
words
"rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
under
section
1983.
"
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
is
revealed
as
to
what
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
intended
some
shadowy
distinction
between
rights
that
have
a
national
interest
and
rights
that
don't
have
a
national
interest
and
i'm
just
trying
to
fathom
whether
that
distinction
makes
enough
sense
that
any
rational
person
could
have
had
it
in
mind.
i
don't
see
the
two.
what
about...
what
about
the...
is
there
a
private
right
in
the
origination
clause?
does
that...
the
origination
of
the
constitution,
does
that
confer
a
private
right
which
requires
tax
bills
to
be
originated
in
the
house
and
we
have
allowed
suits
to
be
brought
alleging
taxes
to
be
unconstitutional
when
they
are
imposed
under
a
taxing
statute
that
did
not
originate
in
the
house
but
originated
in
the
senate.
is
that
a
private
right
in
your
mind
or
a
national
right?
unknown
speaker
you
consider
that
a
national
right
then?
that
would
be
a
national
right,
not
a
1983-type
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartel,
i
think
you
suggest
that,
because
you
really
can't
say
congress'
purpose
or
that
the
purpose
of
the
constitution
was
to
confer
private
rights,
1983
doesn't
cover
it
even
if...
even
if
in
order
to
affect
that
purpose
private
individuals
must
be
given
a
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
the
purpose,
the
purpose
of
the
clause,
whether
you
can
say
that
it's...
the
purpose
was
to
give
private
rights
or
really
just
to
vindicate
a
national
interest.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if...
you
can
say...
even
if
in
order
to
effect
the
purpose
that
the,
that
the
clause
has,
you
must
allow
individuals
to
sue
and
recover.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bartel.
mr.
allen,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjurned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
