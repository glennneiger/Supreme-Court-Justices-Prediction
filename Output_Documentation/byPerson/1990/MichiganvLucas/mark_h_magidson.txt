mr.
mark
h.
magidson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
state
evidentiary
statute
which
as
applied
in
this
particular
case
impermissibly
interfered
with
mr.
lucas'
right
to
present
a
defense
either
by
way
of
cross-examination
or
through
his
own
direct
testimony
on
the
stand.
now
the
statute
involved
here
is
the
michigan
rape
shield
law.
the
overall
purpose,
as
we
have
heard,
is
to
prevent
a
victim
of
rape
from
being
unnecessarily
humiliated
on
the
stand
by
keeping
out
of
evidence
her
prior
sexual
practices,
particularly
as
it
applies
to
third
parties.
all
states,
well,
48
states,
have
passed
rape
shield
laws.
all
of
those
jurisdictions
include
exceptions
to
the
rape
shield
law.
one
exception
is
where
the
prior
sexual
relationship
or
experiences
are
between
the
complaining
witness
and
the
defendant.
all
states
have
those
exceptions.
in
michigan--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--yes.
that's
common.
now,
every
state
has
different
exceptions,
but
common
to
every
jurisdiction
that
i
have
been
able
to
look
at,
common
to
all
of
those
jurisdictions
is
the
fact
that
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
rape
shield
law
is
where
the
prior
sexual
relationship
is
between
the
complaining
witness
and
the
defendant.
in
michigan
if
a
defendant
wishes
to
use
this
evidence,
as
we
have
heard,
he
must
file
a
motion
and
an
offer
of
proof
within
10
days
after
the
arraignment
on
the
information.
and
this
is
the
earliest
notice
requirement
in
the
country.
and
i
take
exception
to
what
was
said
here
as
to
the
time
period.
as
a
practical
matter,
what
we're
talking
about
from
the
time
of
the
arraignment
on
the
information
to
the
time
of
trial
in
wayne
county,
we're
looking
at
between
2
and
4
months.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no,
you
don't.
the
only
reason
i
mention
it
is
that--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--it's
so
out
of
proportion,
the
length
of
time
is
so
out
of
proportion
to
all
of
the
other
jurisdictions,
including
the
federal
rule,
that
i
think
it's
significant,
that
it
raises
an
issue.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
saying
as
in
this
case
as
applied
to
these
facts,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
looking
at,
i
think,
is
the
fact
that
here,
unlike
other
situations,
the
prosecutor
and
the
complaining
witness
both
had
notice
of
the
defense,
in
this
case
the
defense
of
consent.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
the
court
painted
with
a
broad
brush.
i
concede
that.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
yes.
the...
and
i
think
taylor
v.
illinois
gives
us
guidance
where,
as
in
taylor,
you
had
a
defense
counsel
who
it
was
determined
made
a
deliberate
effort
to
misrepresent
to
the
court.
there
the
defense
counsel
said
i
found
a
newly
discovered
witness.
the
trial
court
brought
in
that
witness
and
the
witness
said
no,
i
have
talked
to
the
lawyer
about
a
week
ago.
there
the...
in
taylor,
the
court
here
held
that
where
there
is
a
deliberate
act
by
defense
counsel
to
gain
a
tactical
advantage
to
try
to
somehow
blindside
the
prosecutor,
then
preclusion
might
be
an
appropriate
sanction.
and
i
think
that's
the
standard
we
need
to
look
at.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
because--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--well,
first
this
was
before
the
trial
started.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
i
would
agree--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--the
problem
here
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
intentionally,
in
this
case
she
intentionally
disregarded
the
court
rule.
at
best--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--and
the
court
can.
and
the,
each
case
is
different.
now,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
people
v.
merritt,
which
is
a
michigan
supreme
court
case
dealing
with
alibi,
there
defense
counsel
didn't
file
the
timely
notice-and
the
court,
the
supreme
court
in
michigan,
said
that
there
the
defense
counsel
was
sick,
he
was
ill,
and
that
the
preclusion
sanction
should
only
be
applied
in
the
most
egregious
circumstances.
in
the
case...
in
the
example
that--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--it's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
the
point
being
is
that
i
think
that...
again,
this
court
in
taylor
v.
illinois
has
said
the
same
thing.
the
most
egregious
cases
where
there
might
be
other
remedies--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--it
becomes
a
constitutional
issue
where...
it's
a
balancing
test.
and
where
the
sixth
amendment
rights
become
offended,
then
that's
where
it
becomes
a
constitutional
issue.
if
by
imposing
a
preclusion
sanction
you
are
thereby
infringing
or
impinging
upon
the
rights
of
a
defendant,
sixth
amendment
rights
to
present
a
defense,
then
that's
where
the
balancing
test.
if
it
had
to
do
with
something
other
than
his
constitutional
rights--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--based
on--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
blanket...
per
se
preclusion
under
any
circumstances.
perhaps
in
that
situation
where
already...
the
book...
the
book
is
already
closed,
i
would
say
that
would
be
an
extreme
case,
but--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--well,
if
the
reason
perhaps
is
that
the
defense
counsel
suffered
a
stroke
or
something
during
trial
and
didn't
recall,
i
don't
know
all
the
possibilities.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
well,
the
problem,
at
least
with
this
statute
as
it
was
interpreted
by
the
trial
judge,
the
statute
itself
is
silent.
it
doesn't
give
a
remedy.
it
doesn't
indicate
what
should
be
done.
here
the
trial
court
strictly
construed
this
statute.
number
one,
no
deviations
from
the
time
period.
the
trial...
the
trial
judge
looked
at
the
statute
and
said
well,
the
10-day
time
period
has
passed,
there
is
no
alternatives,
no
alternatives
other
than
preclusion.
and
so
technically
the
trial
counsel
was
correct
in
not
seeking
to
bring
the
motion
later
because
a
court
interpreted
very
strictly.
the
problem
then
with
this
strict
application
of
this
statute
which
required
that
the
time
limits
must
be
strictly
complied
with,
as
well
as
the
preclusion
sanctions
which
followed,
caused
two
problems.
the
problems
are
then
what
is
the
remedy
when
a
defense
attorney
who
was
at
most
negligent
fails
to
comply
with
this
notice
requirement,
and
then
what
are
the
consequences
of
precluding
that
evidence
or
testimony.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no,
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that...
for
this
reason.
they
looked
at
the
purpose
of
notice.
why
have
notice
at
all?
it
has
been
indicated
here
there
is
at
least
two
reasons
to
have
notice.
one
is
to,
in
the
case
of
an
alibi
or
insanity
defense
you
give
notice
to
allow
the
prosecutor
to
prepare.
you
give
notice
of
your
witnesses,
who
they
are,
so
then
they
can
interview
them
or
find
other
witnesses.
the
same
with
insanity.
the
michigan
court
said,
well,
there's
no
need
to
do
that
because
the
party
is
in
court,
number
one,
and
number
two,
the
people
in
this
case
had
notice
at
the
earliest
opportunity
in
this
litigation.
the
defendant
took
the
stand
at
this
preliminary
examination.
he
testified,
and
this
is
even
prior
to
the
arraignment
on
information,
this,
the
preliminary
examination
is
the
first
stage
of
the
criminal
proceeding,
it's
a
hearing.
he
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
that
this
was
a
consensual
act.
we
have
had
sex
many
times
in
the
past,
and
this
was
just
another
situation.
so
at
that
point
he
indicated
to
the
prosecutor
and
to
the
complaining
witness
that
that
was
his
defense.
and
i
think
that
was
behind
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
michigan
was
looking
at.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no.
what
it
becomes
then
is
a...
i
don't
think
they
said
that.
i
think
you
can
preclude
it.
i
think
what
they
were
saying
is
that
the
advance
notice
requirement
where
you
have
the
two
parties
there
in
court
loses
its
logical
underpinnings.
you
don't
need
this
lengthy
notice
period.
what
the
trial
court
could
have
done
right
then
and
there
is
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all
it
could
have
adjourned
the
trial.
but
assuming
that
the
trial
court
didn't
want
to
adjourn
the
trial,
they
could
have
had
a
hearing,
an
in
camera
hearing
right
then
and
there,
could
have
conducted
that,
though
jury
wasn't
selected.
and
this
is
no
different
than
what
occurs
many
times
in
every
court
situation
throughout
the
country.
every
trial
judge
is
faced
with
this.
you
look
at
the
evidence,
an
offer
of
proof
is
made,
and
there
is
an
objection.
the
jury
is
sent
out
and
then
you
decide,
for
instance,
if
there
are
photographs
or
something,
is
it
more
prejudicial
than
probative.
trial
courts
do
this
day
in
and
day
out,
make
these
type
of
rulings
all
the
time.
so
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
saying
is
that
in
these
particular
situations
this
is
no
different,
that
it
could
have
happened
right
then.
the
trial
court
could
have
fashioned
other
remedies
as
well.
i
hate
to
suggest
this,
but
it
could
have
fined
trial
counsel
for
bringing
the
motion
at
the
eleventh
hour.
it
could
have
done...
it
could
have
determined
that
the...
it
could
make
inquiry
into
the
past
sexual,
it
couldn't
cross-examine
the
complaining
witness,
but
it
would
have
allowed
mr.
lucas
to
testify.
there
is
infinite...
amounts
of
possibilities
that
the
trial
court
could
have
done
to
fashion
an
appropriate
remedy.
here
this
didn't
occur.
the
trial
court
felt
that
it
did...
did
not
have
discretion,
which
in
a
factor
was...
we
believe
was
error
and
at
least
i
argued
that
in
the
lower
courts.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
court
always
has
discretion
to
exercise
whatever
appropriate
remedies--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--i
think
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
analysis
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
this
becomes
like
just
a
normal
type
of
weighing
the
prejudicial
effect
versus
probative
value,
and
that
if
it
was
in
fact
more
prejudicial
than
probative,
then
it
wouldn't
be
admitted
and
that
a
separate
hearing
could
have
been
held
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
do
that.
and
that
is
normally
done
in
these
type
of
cases.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
that's
true.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
that's
true.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
no,
absolutely
not.
the--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--this
opinion
is
limited,
as
i
see
it,
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
where
the...
there
had
been
notice
already
and
the
trial
court
failed
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
getting
this
information.
the
failure
to
go
into
this,
to
permit
this,
it
was
suggested
by
counsel
that
it
was
not
that
big
a
deal,
but
the
thing
is
that
this
was
important
testimony
on
the
issue,
in
a
narrow
issue
of
consent.
in
these
cases
the
failure
to
allow
inquiry
into
this
past
sexual
relationship
undermined
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
the
fact
finder
would
have
a
different
impression,
if
you
will,
of
the
credibility
not
only
of
the
complaining
witness
but
then
also
of
the
defendant,
of
his
position,
his
theory,
because
there
were
two
sides
to
this
story,
as
there
is
in
every
case.
and
so
without
that,
having
that
knowledge
of
the
rather
extensive
relationship
between
the
parties,
the
fact
finder
was
deprived
of
having
the
full
picture,
was
not
able
to
make
findings
of
fact
based
on
all
of
the
information.
and
in
this
case,
and
as
the...
as
michigan
has
held
and
all
jurisdictions,
the...
on
the
issue
of,
when
the
defense
is
consent
the
prior
sexual
relationship
between
the
individual
parties
is
more
probative
than
prejudicial.
and
as
far
as,
in
terms
of
the
law
review
and
other
articles,
the
experts
who
have
reviewed
this,
the
state
legislature
in
all
states
have
come
to
similar
conclusions.
so
the
evidence
was
relevant,
was
material,
and
was
more
probative
than
prejudicial.
and
i
think
what
is
also
important
here
is
the...
more
or
less
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
is
that
not
only
was
the
defendant
unable
to
cross-examine
the
complaining
witness
on
this,
he
was
unable
to
testify
in
his...
in
his
own
behalf.
and
so
even
assuming
that,
in
this
case
that
the
witness,
the
complaining
witness,
couldn't
be
cross-examined,
what
justification
was
there
not
to
allow
the
defendant
in
his
own
behalf
to
testify?
the
purpose
00
there
is
two
purposes,
as
we
have
discussed,
of
why
this
notice
provision
existed,
but
one
of
the
purposes
is
not
to
penalize
a
defendant.
he
was
deprived
of
getting
on
the
stand
and
giving
his...
his
own
version
of
what
occurred.
and
this
is
similar
to
cases
where,
for
instance,
the
trial
court
held
that
a
confession
was
voluntary
and
then
prohibited
at
the
time
of
trial
the
defendant
from
testifying
about
police
coercion.
this
court
said
differently.
it
said
that
once
you
allow
a
defendant
to
testify
you
can't
simply
exclude
certain
material
portions
of
his
testimony
without
offending
the
principles
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
due
process.
so
here
mr.
lucas--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--yes,
you
could.
that's
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
there
was...
whenever
the
efforts
were
made
the
prosecutor,
the
trial
prosecutor
would
jump
up
and
object.
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
absolutely.
now...
so
between
those
two
denials,
the
denial
of
the
cross-examination,
the
denial
to
present
his
own
testimony,
we
had
here
an
infringement
done
on
his
constitutional
rights.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
underlying
all
of
this
was
not
an
intentional
or
deliberate
action
on
the
part
of
his
trial
counsel.
in
fact
there
was
a
reference
made
that
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment
on
the
information,
which
was
october
25th,
1984,
his
trial
counsel
at
that
time
pled
him
not
guilty.
and
in
that
case
inquiry
report
that
was
referred
to
there
is
a
notation
that
on
that
same
date,
october
25,
1984,
his
defense
counsel
had
made
a
motion
for
substitution
of
counsel.
we
don't
know...
it's
not
clear
exactly
when
that
occurred.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
record
that
at
the
time,
from
the
arraignment
on
the
information
on,
possibly,
the
defendant
was
not
represented.
the
state
thereafter
appointed
counsel
sometime
in
either
january
or
february
of
1985,
well
after
the
time
to
have...
that
this
motion
could
have
been
filed.
the
strict
interpretation
of
this...
of
this
statute
would
have
precluded.
and
as
the
trial
court
said,
the
10
days
had
passed,
so
what
was
the
defendant
to
do?
so
this
is
why
it's
different
than
in
the
case
of
taylor
v.
illinois
where
there
was
a
deliberate
effort
to
gain
a
tactical
advantage.
here
at
most
we
have
negligence.
now--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--no.
i
don't
think
that
they
said
that.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
not
because
of
notice.
well,
they've
indicated...
they
indicated
was
it
lost
its
logical
underpinnings.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
exactly.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
right.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
it...
i
think
that
that's
one
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
know
that
it
has
to
be
interpreted.
i
think
what
it's...
we're
looking
at
here
is
the
facts
of
this
case
where
notice
was
in
effect
given
at
the
preliminary
examination.
now,
whether
in
a
different
case
if
there
was
no
notice
given...
we
have...
i
have...
we
have
no
quarrel.
we're
not
saying
that
there's...
notice
isn't
a
legitimate
requirement
under--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--certainly
there
is
a
far
less
need
to
require
notice,
and
that's
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
indicated.
but
for...
i
don't
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
notice
in
a
criminal
procedure,
as
was
indicated
in
florida
v.
williams,
that's
been
held
to
be
constitutional
as
long
as
it's
reasonable.
but
what
is
reasonable
in
one
context
can
be
unreasonable
in
another
context,
and
i
think
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
indicated
in
this
particular
context,
where
there's...
notice
was
already
provided
at
the
preliminary
examination,
there
was
no
need,
it
lost
its
logical
underpinnings.
and
particularly
since--
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
--sure.
there...
i
am
sure
there
are.
there
are
probably
many.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
i
think
it
could,
but
when
balancing
the
two
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
that
great
of
inconvenience
to
have
a...
it
prior
to
trial.
mr.
mark
h.
magidson
there
would
be
some
inconvenience,
because
the
normal
administration
of
justice,
but
there
are
normally,
in
any
felony
trial
there
is
normally
motions
eliminating
other
pretrial
matters
taken
up
by
a
court,
and
frequently
other
types
of
hearings
are
conducted
at
the
type
of
trial,
walker
hearing,
motions
to
suppress.
testimony
sometimes
in
wayne
county
is
heard
even
at
the
day
of
trial
because
you
have
the
witnesses
present
and
they
don't...
trial
doesn't
require...
the
trial
court
doesn't
require
witnesses
to
come
down
twice.
they
come
down
once
for
the
motion
and
then
for
the
day
of
trial.
so
there
would
be
some
inconvenience,
but
on
the
other
hand
there
could
be
convenience
for
doing
it
at
the
time
of
trial
as
well.
now,
there
is
just
one
other
area
i
would
like
to
address,
and
that
is
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
this
should
be
remanded
to
determine
whether
this
was
harmless
error.
and
i
would
just
indicate
that
the
michigan
supreme
court,
after
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
the
michigan
supreme
court
then
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
harmless
error
analysis.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
made
that
analysis
and
determined
that
since
credibility
was
central
to
the
case,
that
this
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
and
here
this
court
has
given
great
deference
to
the
state
court's
interpretation
regarding
harmless
error.
this
is
different
than,
say,
van
arsdall
where
there
was
no
state
determination.
and
in
fact
the
michigan...
after
that
analysis
was
made
it
was
then
taken
back
up
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
let
the
decision
stand.
so
here
there
is...
we
believe
that
the
error
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
we
would
ask
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
decision
be
affirmed.
that
concludes
my
argument.
