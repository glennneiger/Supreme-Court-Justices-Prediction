justice
kennedy
you
said
there
were
two
interests
that
the
state
had,
and
one
is
the
privacy
rights
of
the
victim,
and
what's
the
other?
justice
kennedy
is
there
much
doubt
in
this
case
but
that
the
evidence
should
not
have
been
admitted
had
the
notice
been
given?
justice
kennedy
or
should
have
been
admitted?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
that
if
there
had
been
a
hearing
in
the
case
the
judge
would
have
given
certain
instructions
and
rulings
as
to
the
extent
to
which
this
relationship
could
have
been
described?
justice
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
are
substantial
privacy
rights
of
the
victim
that
could
and
would
likely
have
been
protected
in
this
case
had
some
advance
notice,
particularly
the
notice
required
by
the
statute,
been
given?
justice
kennedy
are
there
provisions
in
michigan
for
closing
the
preliminary
hearings?
justice
kennedy
the
trial
is
before
a
12-person
jury?
justice
kennedy
was
this
a
bench
trial?
justice
kennedy
but
it
would
be
some
inconvenience?
