mr.
don
w.
atkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated
when
the
notice
and
hearing
provision
of
the
michigan
rape
shield
law
is
applied
to
exclude
arguably
relevant
evidence
when
no
attempt
is
made
to
cure
the
defect
until
the
very
day
of
trial.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case
held
that
not
only
the
10-day
notice
provision,
but
also
the
pretrial
hearing
provision
of
the
rape
shield
law,
violated
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights
to
confrontation,
quote,
"when
applied
to
preclude
the
evidence
of
specific
instances
of
prior
sexual
conduct
between
the
complainant
and
the
defendant.
"
at
the
outset
let
me
make
clear
what
the
statute
both
requires
and
what
it
prohibits.
what
the
statute
requires
simply
is
two
things:
that
a
notice
be
filed
within
10
days
after
the
arraignment
on
the
information
requesting
the
court
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
particular
evidence
of
prior
sexual
conduct
between
the
defendant
and
the
victim
is
relevant
and
is
to
be
admitted.
this
notice
in
turn
triggers
a
very
important
procedural
aspect
of
this
case,
and
that
is
the
pretrial
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
both
logically
and
legally
admissible
in
the
case
when
tried.
the
importance,
i
think,
of
the
rape
shield
law,
at
least
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here
in
michigan,
is
that
the
underlying
principle
of
that
particular
notice
provision
serves
two
very
fundamental
purposes.
the
major
premise,
of
course,
that
the
legislature
of
michigan
decided
upon
was
that
the
victim
of
sexual
assaults
certainly
has
a
right
to
her
sexual
privacy,
and
that
in
doing
so
we
want
to
counterbalance
that
interest,
which
i
believe
is
clearly
a
legitimate
interest,
with
the
interest
of
the
defendant.
and
how
best
to
do
that?
mr.
don
w.
atkins
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
believe
that's
what
they
said.
in
this
particular--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
not
be
standing
before
the
court
today
except
for
the
facts
in
this
case,
in
which
the
default
occurred
on
the
very
day
of
trial,
some
7
months
after
the
arraignment
on
the
information.
i
would...
readily
admit
to
the
court
today
that
there
has
to
be,
to
protect
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights,
a
sliding
scale
of
remedies,
if
you
will.
if
in
fact
this
case
had
turned
on
a
situation
in
which
the
notice
had
been
filed
on
the
eleventh
day
after
the
arraignment
on
the
information,
or
perhaps
at
some
other
reasonable
time
before
trial
in
the
case,
and
i
don't
know
what
that
time
would
be,
it
could
be
as
little
as
2
days,
it
could
be
as
little
as
a
week,
but
somewhere
in
between
there
the
court,
the
trial
court
hearing
that
motion
must
determine
that
automatic
preclusion
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
the
statute
does
not
require
outright
preclusion
because
it
is
indeed
silent
upon
that.
it
says
it
shall
not
be
admissible,
but
it
does
not
indicate
that
total
preclusion
is
the
only
remedy.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
should
be
the
only
remedy.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
the
other
one
is
the
balancing
of
the
rights
of
the
defendant,
the
confrontational
rights
of
the
defendant.
because
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
as
correctly
noted
earlier,
is
that
we're
dealing
with
a
notice
provision.
but
that
notice
provision
is
intended
to
provide
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
with
a
window
of
opportunity,
if
you
will,
a
window
which
will
permit
him
to
bring
before
the
trier
of
fact,
or
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
i
should
say,
to
determine
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
whether
the
evidence
he
wishes
to
bring
in
is
logically
and
legally
relevant
and
admissible.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
should
not
have
been
admitted,
your
honor?
mr.
don
w.
atkins
taking
it
either
way,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
legitimate
argument
that
could
be
made,
and
i
think
i
attempted
to
make
it
earlier
in
my
brief,
that
what
i
think
we
were
dealing
with
in
this
particular
case
was
not
so
much
the
evidence
of
the
actual
details
of
the
sexual
encounters
that
they
experienced
in
a
previous
time
before
this
event.
what
the
defendant,
i
think,
wished
to
get
across
to
the
court
and
the
trier
of
fact
was
that
there
was
an
intimate
relationship
which
may
have
included
a
sexual
aspect
to
that
relationship.
there
was
no
indication
of
an
offer
of
proof
or
otherwise
that
the
specific
details
of
the
sexual
encounters
they
had
earlier,
before
these
events
occurred
on
august
31,
had
any
particular
relevance
to
the
defense
presented
at
trial.
the
defense
was
one
of
consent
because
we
had
a
intimate
relationship
at
an
earlier
time.
nevertheless,
whether
or
not
that's
the
case,
a
general
sexual
aspect
of
the
relationship,
or
whether
a
specific
sexual
act
was
important,
i
don't
believe
is
truly
necessary
for
this
court's
consideration.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
the
judge
could
have
fashioned
a
remedy.
there...
clearly
he
could
have.
he
could
have
either
permitted,
if
the
evidence
which
the
defendant
wished
to
place
before
the
trier
of
fact
required
the
details
of
past
sexual
encounters,
or
just
simply
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
sexual
relationship.
but
again,
what
this
case
is
not
about,
it's
not
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
case
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
it's
not
about
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion
by
utilizing
a
preclusion
evidence...
of
the
evidence,
and
it's
not
about
whether
the
actual
evidence
which
may
have
been
offered
would
have
been
relevant
and
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
that
is
precisely
my
point.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
it
was
in
fact.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
it
is
true,
your
honor,
and
it's
quite
regrettable,
and
i
believe,
and
i'll
admit
to
the
court
that
i
think
the
prosecutor
at
the
preliminary
examination
simply
dropped
the
ball.
an
objection
should
have
been
made--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--i
believe
it
would
have,
because
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
what
occurs
prior
to
trial.
all
that
the
statute
permits
is
that
10-day
window
of
opportunity.
it
is
maybe
silent
as
to
what
occurs
before
that,
but
nevertheless,
i
think
the
purposes
of
that
could
have
been
prevented
at
the
preliminary
examination.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
the
examination...
well,
if
nothing
else,
your
honor,
certainly
on
relevance
grounds.
because
at
the
examination,
the
focus
of
the
preliminary
examination
is
only
to
determine
probable
cause.
a
question
of
what
defense
may
arise
later
at
trial
is
not
properly
before
a
preliminary
examination
magistrate.
all
that
that
magistrate
needs
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
the
crime
has
been
committed,
and
whether
or
not
this
defendant
may
have
committed
it.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
no,
it
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel
during
his
cross-examination
of
the
witness.
the
specific
sexual
detail
evidence,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
there
are
provisions,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
it
would
have
applied
in
this
case
anyway.
it
was
not
certainly
requested
by
the
prosecution
beforehand,
and
again,
i
don't
know
why
the
prosecutor
didn't
object.
nevertheless,
i
don't
believe
that
would
foreclose
the
prosecutor
subsequently
at
trial
from
attempting
to
exclude
that
evidence.
because
again,
if
you
go
to
the
purposes
of
the
rape
shield
law,
that
is
simply
to
protect
at
every
possible
opportunity,
and
it
should
not
preclude
the
admission
or
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence
at
any
subsequent
hearing,
whether
it
be
at
pretrial
hearing
after
the
arraignment
or
whether
it
be
at
the
trial
itself.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
this
one
wasn't.
but
of
course
it
would
have
been
otherwise,
because
of
the--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--it
ended
up
being
a
bench
trial
after
the
oral
motion
made
on
the
day
of
trial
was
denied.
at
that
point,
immediately
thereafter,
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
waived
the
right
to
jury
trial,
and
then
the
case
was
heard
by
the
very
judge
who
in
fact
heard
the
oral
motion
for
permission
to
admit
that
evidence.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
10
days
after
the
arraignment
on
the
information.
your
honor,
again,
this
statute
was
the
first
one
in
the
country
to
be
enacted
in
1974.
and
i
think
others
were
modeled
perhaps
after
it,
and
changed
subsequently
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
legislature's
interest
in
it.
but
in
this
particular
case
trials
in
michigan,
once
the
arraignment
of
the
information
is
had,
actually
enters
onto
a
relatively
fast
track.
in
this
case
i
think
the
docket
entries
and
the
case
inquiry
notice,
which
is
part
of
the
court
record,
would
indicate
that
the
trial
date
originally
was
set
for
sometime
in
late
november,
a
period
of
only
4
weeks
after
the
arraignment
on
the
information.
there
was
a
final
conference
date
of
november
14,
1984,
at
which
point
the
first
adjournment
was
had.
what
i
am
trying
to
indicate,
of
course,
to
the
justice
is
this,
that
the
10-day
period
after
the
arraignment
was
set
because
essentially
many
cases
in
michigan,
even
cases
such
as
this,
a
major
felony
case,
could
be
tried
within
a
very
short
period
of
time
after
the
arraignment.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
think
it
could
have
been
done
either
way,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
arraignment
on
the
information
date
was
selected
because,
quite
frankly,
federal
felony
trials
such
as
this
could
be
tried,
certainly
in
wayne
county
even
though
it's
a
busy
metropolitan
court,
anywhere
from
2
to
4
weeks
after
the
arraignment.
so
by
setting
it
earlier
you
accomplish
a
number
of
tasks
required
of
it,
namely
that
you
do
not
surprise
the
prosecution.
there
are
cases
in
which
extensive
prehearings,
pretrial
hearings
may
be
necessary
in
a
case
such
as
this
or
even
one
in
which
the
facts
are
somewhat
different.
you
prevent
the
surprise,
you
permit
both
sides
an
opportunity
to
gather
their
sources,
if
you
will,
for
full
investigation
and
analysis
at
that
closed
in
camera
hearing.
it
also
provides
another
important
aspect,
and
that
is
for
the
judge
in
the
individual
case.
rather
than
getting
to
a
position
1
day
or
the
day
of
trial
in
which
you
have
what
may
be
called
hydraulic
pressures
upon
the
court
to
go
at
that
time
with
the
trial,
if
you
have
a
pretrial
hearing
sufficiently
in
advance
of
trial,
the
trial
judge
has
the
opportunity
to
sit
back
calmly,
if
you
will,
or
at
least
in
a
more
detached,
less
pressurized
atmosphere,
to
consider
the
arguments
and
the
evidence
of
both
sides,
both
the
defendant's
evidence
and
the
prosecution's
evidence.
so
there
are
some
very
important
i
think
benefits
not
only
to
the
prosecution
but
also
to
the
defendant
in
preparing
the
case.
and
i
think
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
evidence
sought
to
be
excluded
or
included,
if
it's
the
defendant's
point
of
view,
is
that
you
have
an
opportunity
again
for
that
thorough
analysis
beforehand
of
permitting
a
more
realistic,
even-handed
approach.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
that
particular
question
is
not.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
it
could
be
in
other
situations,
your
honor.
again,
i
think
this
particular
case
is
important,
and
it's
important
to
the
court
i
think
because
it
came
on
the
day
of
trial.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
i
think
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
and,
in
guarding
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights,
to
be
able
at
a
sufficient
time
before
trial
to
hold
this
kind
of
a
hearing.
i
think
preclusion
may
be
appropriate
and,
of
course
as
in
taylor
v.
illinois,
the
court
held
that
a
preclusion
remedy
was
appropriate,
and
i
believe
that
violation
occurred
either
on
the
day
of
trial
or
perhaps
even
the
second
day
of
trial.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
believe
they
did
in
the
initial
opinion.
i
believe
they
said
that
it
was
definitely
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
no,
in
this
case,
which
relied
upon
the
williams
decision.
this
particular
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
lucas
case.
in
the
case,
the
initial
decision
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
alluded
to
and
specifically
referred
to
relying
upon
the
decision
in
the
williams
case--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--at
95
michigan
appeals,
i
believe
it
is.
and
that
case
was
specifically
grounded
upon
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
think
it
makes
it
clearer,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
the
lucas--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do,
because
it
in
turn
relied
upon
the
williams
case.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
think
you
could
do
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
if
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
mentioned
in
the
lucas
opinion,
then
you,
of
course--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
yes.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
absolutely.
and
i
think
that
can
be
found
in
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
the
hackett
case
in
which
justice
boyl
discusses
that
there
may
be
other
sixth
amendment
rights
that
are
not
covered
by
the
statute
which
have
to
be
considered
by
a
trial
court
even
though
they
may
not
be
specifically
mentioned.
in
other
words,
michigan
takes
a
broad
view
of
not
only
the
victim's
rights,
but
the
necessary
confrontational
rights
of
the
defendant.
they
too
must
be
defended
as
well.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
reserve
any
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
don
w.
atkins
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
very
brief
points
i
would
like
to
make.
i
believe
if
the
court
in
reading
the
case
will
understand
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan
did
in
this
case
was
really
say
flat
out
that
whenever
you're
excluding
evidence
which
involves
prior
sexual
conduct
between
the
defendant
and
the
complainant
in
a
particular
case,
that
alone...
that
alone
violates
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation.
the
only
issue
that
i
think
is
properly
before
this
court,
as
i
have
tried
to
emphasize
earlier
in
this
case,
is
that
the
question
being
whether
the
operation
of
the
notice
and
prehearing
provisions
of
the
rape
shield
law
in
and
of
themselves
are
violative
of
a
defendant's
right
to
confrontation.
that
is
the
only
issue.
i
think
the
issue
is
simply
that.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i
think,
your
honor,
you
could
have
taken
another
tack,
and
the
tack
is
this,
whether
or
not
that
evidence
would
have
been
object--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--no,
your
honor.
i...
again
i
would
say
that
i
think
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
flat
out
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
period,
when
applied
to
prior
sexual
conduct
between
the
defendant
and
the
victim,
and
those
being
the
two--
mr.
don
w.
atkins
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
well,
the
notice...
i
think
they
have
said
that
both
the
notice
and
the
pretrial
hearing
provision,
in
camera
hearing
provision,
were
both
in...
together...
tandem,
unconstitutional
when
applied
to
this
situation
without
any
further
consideration.
mr.
don
w.
atkins
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
is
quite
how
i
see
it
either,
your
honor,
but
i
do
see
it
as
a
situation
in
which
the
notice
itself
cannot,
in
my
opinion,
preclude
a
defendant
from...
or
deny
a
defendant
his
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation.
i
think
the
issues
of
whether
or
not
the
evidence
may
have
been
relevant,
again
whether
they
are
issues
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
failure
to
raise
it,
are
all
collateral
issues
which,
even
in
the
state
of
michigan,
a
defendant
can
raise
in
subsequent
proceedings
after
consideration
by
this
court.
but
i
think
again,
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
would
have
prevented
the
kind
of
remedy
provided
here.
i
would
say
in
a
lesser
situation
perhaps
something
else
would
have
been
appropriate,
but
i
think
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
and
i
think
the
trial
court
properly
drew
the
line
on
the
day
of
trial.
i
think
those
are
the
only
issues
before
the
court,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
that
in
light
of
the
matter
before
it
and
the
evidence
presented
at
trial,
that
this
court
in
fact
reverse
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
