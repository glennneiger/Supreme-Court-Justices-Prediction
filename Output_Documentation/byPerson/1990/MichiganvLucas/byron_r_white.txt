justice
white
what
happens
in
a
preliminary
hearing
in
a
case
like
this?
i
take
it
from
the
record
that
this
entire
relationship
was
gone
into
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
white
that
doesn't
sound
like
it's
got,
that
the
state
has
much
interest
in
the
privacy
of
the
victim,
if
a
public
preliminary
hearing
washes
all
this
linen.
justice
white
would
the
statute
apply
to
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
white
on
what
grounds?
justice
white
well,
they,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
conviction
because,
as
i
read
it,
it
said
that,
that
what
is
left
is
the
usual
evidentiary
issues
of
the
materiality
of
the
evidence
to
the
issues
in
the
case
and
the
balancing
of
its
probative
value
with
the
danger
of
unfair
prejudice.
the
trial
court
did
not
exclude
the
proposed
testimony
on
either
of
those
grounds.
you
would
think
that
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
the
trial
court
had--
justice
white
--excluded
the
evidence
on
those
grounds.
justice
white
so,
it
sounds...
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
saying
there's
a
per
se
rule--
justice
white
--against
the
exclusion,
total
exclusion
of
these--
justice
white
--williams
reads
like
it,
but
this
opinion
doesn't.
justice
white
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
where
the
evidence
offered
is
prior
sexual
relationship
between
the
victim
and
the
defendant
that
you
never
exclude
the
evidence
based
solely
on
the
lack
of
notice?
justice
white
they
didn't?
i
thought
they...
i
thought
they
said
that...
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
they
said.
they
said
you
might
be
able
to
exclude
it
when
it's
offered
on
the
basis...
on
materiality
or
undue
prejudice,
but
not
because
they
didn't
have
notice.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
and
they
followed
williams
in
that
regard.
justice
white
so
it
is
a
per
se
rule
that
where
the
victim
and
the
defendant
are
the
ones
involved,
that
the
notice
statute
cannot
be
applied
at
all?
justice
white
even
where
the...
where
the
evidence
concerns
the
victim
and
the
defendant?
justice
white
do
you
agree
that
there
are
instances
in
which
the
victim's
relation
with
the
defendant
cannot
be
explored
as
to
certain
of
the
details
of
that
relationship?
are
there
ever
instances
where
limiting
instructions
in
the
court
are
proper?
justice
white
and
do
you
agree
that
there
are
some
instances
when
it
would
be
of
material
assistance
to
the
court
to
have
that
hearing
in
advance
of
the
trial?
justice
white
you
mean
just
the
fact
of
having...
of
requiring
notice?
requiring
notice--
