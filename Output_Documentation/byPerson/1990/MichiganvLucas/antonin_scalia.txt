justice
scalia
it
wasn't
marginal,
general
starr.
i
mean,
you
think
that
that's
the...
is
that
necessary
for
reversing
here?
justice
scalia
so,
well...
we
should
remand
and
say
what?
consider
whether
it
was
crucial
evidence?
if
it...
if
it
wasn't
crucial
evidence,
then
you're
wrong,
but
if
it...
or
if
it
was
crucial
evidence,
then
you
are
wrong?
justice
scalia
suppose
it
was
crucial
evidence.
could
it
have
been
kept
out?
justice
scalia
i
know
we'd
have
a
different
case.
could
it
be
kept
out?
justice
scalia
well,
would
it?
justice
scalia
i
know
it.
i'm
saying
assuming
it
is
critical,
can't
the
state
say
this
is
the
way
we
run
a
trial?
you
get
this
evidence
in
in
advance.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
provisions.
suppose
there
are
requirements
that
you
list
your
witnesses
for
the
trial
judge
before
the
trial,
and
then
somebody
comes
in
at
the
last
minute,
never
having
listed
a
witness,
no
particular
reason,
and
says
i
want
to
get
on
an
additional
witness.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
to
let
that
witness
on?
justice
scalia
mr.
magidson,
why,
why
isn't
it
always
an
appropriate
sanction,
at
least
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
always
all
right
to
insist
upon
the
rules
of
trial?
suppose
what
had
happened
here
is
that
the
jury
had
retired
to
consider
its
verdict
and
defense
counsel
jumps
up
and
says
oh,
your
honor,
i
meant
to
call
one
other
witness?
i'm
sorry
about
that,
i
forgot
to
do
it
before
the
jury
retired,
but
please
let
me
call,
this
one
other
witness
is
very
important
to
our
case.
and
the
judge
says
i'm
sorry,
we
have
a
rule
you
put
in
your
witnesses
before
the
jury
retires.
no,
you
can't.
it
is
excluded.
you
broke
the
rule,
you
lose.
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
a
different
time,
it's
a
different
rule,
but
it's
the
same
principle.
there
are
rules
of
trial.
the
rules
are
clear.
they're
not
difficult
to
comply
with.
this
counsel
didn't
comply
with
them.
justice
scalia
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
scalia
well,
in
my
hypothetical
counsel
just
forgot.
it
wasn't
intentional.
but
there
are
rules
of
trial.
why
can't
the
court
enforce
the
rules
of
trial?
justice
scalia
but
that,
but
that's
the
issue
for
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
does
that
have
to
be
a
constitutional
rule?
i
mean,
i
would
not
say
that
you
must
exclude
it
all
the
time,
but
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
why
can't
you
say
a
rule
is
a
rule
if
a
state
wants
to
do
it
that
way?
justice
scalia
you
would
extend
that
to
the
first
hypothetical
i
gave
you
also,
to
where
the
trial
is
over,
the
jury
is
retired,
and
you
want
to
get
in
additional
evidence?
justice
scalia
you
would
extend
that
rule?
you
would
not
say
too
bad?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
why
it's
more
extreme.
it's
very
easy
to
say
wait
a
minute,
we'll
call
the
jury
back
in,
we
have
one
more
witness.
no
big
deal.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
the
constitution
requires
a
state
to
do
that.
i
think
a
state
can
say
the
rule
is
the
rule.
you
didn't...
we
have
a
way
that
we
try
cases
around
here.
this
is
the
way.
you
didn't
do
it.
the
evidence
doesn't
get
in.
period.
justice
scalia
--they
didn't
say
the
notice
provision
was
unconstitutional,
only
enforcing
it
by
exclusion
was
unconstitutional.
