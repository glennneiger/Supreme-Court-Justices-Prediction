justice
stevens
mr.
atkins,
can
i
interrupt?
i
have
a
little
difficulty
getting...
really
focusing
on
the
precise
issue
before
us.
as
i
understand
it
the
opinion
we're
reviewing
is
the
one
in
appendix
8
of
the
cert.
petition,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
per
curiam,
in
which
they
say
they
solely
upon
the
failure
of
defendant
to
comply
with
the
notice
provision
of
subsection
2,
they
reverse,
and
that
because
the
michigan
court
had
previously
held
that
provision
unconstitutional.
is
there
anything
in
this
opinion
that
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
indicates
that
this
was
based
on
a
federal
ground?
justice
stevens
where
in
the
opinion
do
they
say
anything
about...
they
don't
cite
the
sixth
amendment
or
any
federal
cases.
justice
stevens
by
the
initial
opinion,
do
you
mean
the
opinion
in
this
case
or
in
the
williams
case?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i'm
asking
about
this
case.
do
we
have
to
read
the
williams
opinion
to
understand
the
basis
for
their
holding
the
notice
opinion
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
can
you
tell
me
whether
on
the
face
of
this
opinion
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
this
decision
was
based
on
federal
law?
justice
stevens
just
because
it
cited
a
michigan
case
which
in
turn
relied
on
it.
so
you
have
to
go
to
the
other
case
to
find
the
federal
ground
for
decision?
justice
stevens
well,
you
must
do
it,
isn't
that
true?
justice
stevens
i
don't
find
it
mentioned
and
i
don't
find
any
federal
cases
cited.
and
the
sixth
amendment...
on
the
sixth
amendment
they
hold
that
the
fact
that
the
notice
had
to
be
given
within
10
days
made,
violated
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
general
starr,
in
the
survey,
is
this
the
only
statute
that
has
this
particular
10-day
notice
requirement?
justice
stevens
but
the
only
reason
i
ask
you,
i
suppose
if
we
affirm
in
this
case
it
would
not
necessarily
invalidate
the
rape
shield
statutes
all
over
the
country.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
trial
judge
would
have
excluded
it
even
if
the
offer
had
been
made
on
the
eleventh
day,
as
i
understand.
justice
stevens
all
i
did
was
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
says
based
solely
on
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
notice
provision.
justice
stevens
and
that
was
the
sole
reason
for
their
decision.
justice
stevens
so
we
have
to
examine
the
trial
transcript
to
find
out
the
grounds
for
decision,
too?
and
was
he
relying...
well,
never
mind.
