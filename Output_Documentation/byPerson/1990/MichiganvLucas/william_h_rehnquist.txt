we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-149,
michigan
against
lucas.
mr.
atkins.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
statute
simply
doesn't
say
what
the
remedy
is,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
this...
was
this
testimony
at
the
preliminary
brought
out
by
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
atkins.
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
would
trial
before
a
judge
make
any
difference
than
trial
before
a
jury
on
that
point,
general
starr?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
whole
thing
is
governed
by
what
a
state
can
do
with
respect
to
individual
cumulative
witnesses
is
governed
by
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
chambers
is
a
total
sport.
it
has
never
been
cited
again
in
any
opinion
of
this
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
magidson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
magidson,
are
you
saying
that
all
the
others,
the
other
47
states
all
have
that
particular
exception?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
a
constitutional
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
or
just
an
interpretation
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
as
i
read
their
opinion,
mr.
magidson,
didn't
rely
at
all
on
the
first
part,
on
the
first
of
the
two
problems
you
say.
that
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
notice...
the
notice
was
given
long
after
the
statutory
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
didn't...
wasn't
their
stated
reason
for
saying
this
thing
is
applied
or
this
statute
was
unconstitutional
was
that
you
could
not
preclude
testimony
about
past
relationships
between
the
defendant
and
the
victim,
whatever
you
could
do
with
respect
to
third
parties?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
part
of
the
reason
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals'
holding
that
this...
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
only
to
provide
notice
and
give
the
state
a
chance
to
investigate
this
testimony,
and
since
it
was
testimony
only
involving
the
defendant
and
the
victim
there
was
no
need
for
that
sort
of
investigation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
then
they
in
effect
rejected
the
state's
claim
that
this
evidence,
quite
apart
from
notice,
could
be
reviewed
and
excluded
if
it
was
not
material?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
could
exclude
parts
of
his
testimony
on
the
ground
that
they
were
irrelevant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
an
effort
made
to
cross-examine
the
victim
on
the
same
subject?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
was
sustained
by
the
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
magidson.
mr.
atkins,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
atkins,
justice
white
asked
your
colleague
a
question
about
whether
the
last
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
doesn't
suggest
that
the
testimony
could
have
been
excluded
on
the
basis
of
its
material...
lack
of
materiality
or
on
the
balancing
process,
the
thought
being
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
trial
court
might
have
done
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
but
i'm
interested
in
your
view
of
whether
or
not
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
that
or
held
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
this
case,
you
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
atkins.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
