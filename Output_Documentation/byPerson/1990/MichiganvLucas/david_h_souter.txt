justice
souter
mr.
atkins,
what
is
the
state's...
there's
no
question
about
the
interest
in
the
victim's
privacy
or
in
the
defendant's
right
to
confrontation.
how
do
you
articulate
the
state's
interest
in
requiring
notice
so
early
on
in
the
proceeding,
10
days
from
the--
justice
souter
--so
that
we
really
ought
to
look
at
it
not
so
much
as
a
case
requiring,
or
a
statute
requiring
notice
10
days
after
arraignment,
but
requiring
notice
say
3
or
4
weeks
before
the
trial
date?
that
would
be
an
equally
accurate
way
of
looking
at
the
effect
of
this?
justice
souter
mr.
atkins,
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
something
you
said
in
response
to
one
of
justice
o'connor's
questions.
is
it
correct
that
you
agree
that
there
has
got
to
be
some
kind
of
an
exception
mechanism
applied
to
the
statute?
justice
souter
okay.
