justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
atkins,
in
this
case
aren't
we
dealing
just
with
the
notice
requirement
of
this
statute?
isn't
that
all
we
have
before
us
here?
justice
o'connor
and
the
statute
does
not
itself
specify
what
the
trial
court
will
do
if
the
notice
is
not
given
in
a
timely
fashion.
justice
o'connor
and
in
this
case
the
trial
court
decided
to
preclude
the
testimony
and
the
evidence
because
of
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
notice
requirement.
justice
o'connor
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
held
that
preclusion
of
the
evidence
in
every
case
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
o'connor
so
that's
what
we
have
to
review,
whether
that
approach
is
correct
and
whether
there
might
be
some
cases
were
preclusion
is
allowable.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
atkins,
i
didn't
think
the
court
below
addressed
the
question
of
whether
the
notice
period
is
too
short.
is
that
before
us?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
and
why
isn't
the
state's
interest
sufficiently
protected,
even
though
the
request
comes
late
to
consider
this
testimony
and
offer
it,
if
the
trial
court
grants
an
in
camera
hearing
and
considers
alternative
sanctions
but
lets
the
evidence
in?
i
mean,
isn't
that
a
possibility
and
an
appropriate
way
to
address
the
state's
interests?
justice
o'connor
well,
general
starr,
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
question
because
the
court
below
didn't
make
any
findings
on
the
critical
nature
of
the
evidence
or
the
prejudice
to
the
defendant
here.
justice
o'connor
it
could
be
remanded.
justice
o'connor
well,
we
don't
have
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
time
of
the
notice
before
us
in
this
case,
though,
do
we?
justice
o'connor
granted,
it's
short,
but
i
didn't
think
we
had
to
decide
that...
decide
it
on
that
basis
here.
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
now...
yes.
now,
do
you
agree
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
here
said
that
preclusion
could
never
be
a
remedy
by
virtue
of
the
constitution?
justice
o'connor
in
essence
that
appeared
to
be
its
holding,
a
per
se
rule.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
appears,
if
you
look
at
the
authorities
they
rely
on,
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
thinks
at
least
that
in
all
cases
where
it
would
preclude
evidence
of
sexual
conduct
between
a
victim
and
the
defendant,
that
preclusion
cannot
be
imposed.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
derive
from
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
that
was
its
rule,
do
you
think
that's
accurate?
might
there
not
be
some
cases
and
some
circumstances
where
preclusion
even
of
that
testimony
might
be
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
of
the
cases
is
michigan
against
lucas
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
like
most
states,
michigan
has
a
rape
shield
statute
designed
to
protect
victims
of
rape
from
being
questioned
at
trial
about
their
past
sexual
behavior.
the
statute
contains
a
limited
exception
that
allows
a
defendant
to
introduce
evidence
of
his
own
past
sexual
conduct
with
the
victim
provided
that
he
gives
a
timely
notice
to
the
court
and
the
victim
by
filing
a
written
motion
and
offer
of
proof.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
criminal
sexual
conduct.
the
state
alleged
that
the
respondent
had
used
a
knife
to
force
his
ex-girlfriend
into
his
apartment
where
he
forced
her
to
engage
in
several
non-consensual
sexual
acts.
at
no
time
did
lucas
file
a
written
motion
and
offer
of
proof
as
the
michigan
statute
required.
nonetheless,
at
the
start
of
the
trial,
the
respondent's
attorney
asked
the
court
to
allow
the
defense
to
present
evidence
of
a
prior
sexual
relationship
between
the
respondent
and
the
alleged
victim.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
relying
on
the
requirements
of
the
statute
which
were
not
met.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
adapting
a
per
se
rule
that
the
state's
notice
requirement
violates
the
sixth
amendment
in
all
cases
where
it
is
used
to
preclude
evidence
of
past
sexual
conduct
between
a
rape
victim
and
a
criminal
defendant.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
vacate
and
remand.
in
the
case
of
taylor
against
illinois,
this
court
rejected
the
argument
that
probative
evidence
may
never
be
precluded
as
a
penalty
for
a
criminal
defendant's
failure
to
comply
with
a
legitimate
state
procedural
rule.
the
same
is
true
here.
michigan's
rape
shield
statute
serves
legitimate
state
interest
in
protecting
rape
victims
against
surprised
harassment
and
undue
delay.
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
may
in
some
cases
justify
even
the
severe
sanction
of
preclusion
of
evidence.
respondent
argues
that
the
preclusion
of
evidence
was
unconstitutional
in
this
case.
we
express
no
opinion
on
this
question,
and
leave
it
to
the
michigan
courts
on
remand
to
address
in
the
first
instance
whether
the
state's
rape
shield
statute
authorizes
preclusion
and
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
preclusion
violated
respondent's
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
