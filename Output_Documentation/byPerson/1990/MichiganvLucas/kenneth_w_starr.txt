mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
over
the
past
15
to
20
years,
48
states
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
passed
rape
shield
statutes.
michigan's
law
was
the
first.
it
was
the
first
in
a
series
of
efforts
throughout
the
nation
to
protect
rape
victims,
and
specifically
of
responding
to
the
problem
of
forcing
rape
victims
to
endure
what
frequently
became,
in
the
view
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
other
state
legislatures,
an
unnecessarily
humiliating
process
with
the
systemic
effect
that,
in
the
view
of
congress,
rape
victims
were
less
willing
to
report
this
chronically
under-reported
crime.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
however,
it
is
my
understanding,
as
mr.
atkins
indicated,
that
the
arraignment
date
in
michigan
is
in
fact
closely
tied,
ordinarily,
to
the
trial
date.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
except
that
the
ground
on
which
this
statute
was
invalidated
did
not
have
to
do
with
the
timing
of
the
notice.
it
had
to
do,
rather,
with
to
whom
this
statute
applied.
as
i
understand
the
attack
in
the
state
courts,
there
was
no
indication
at
all
that
the
period
for
challenging
or
for
educing
the
notice
and
to
file
the
appropriate
motion
and
the
like
was
unreasonable.
indeed
it
couldn't
have
been
here.
this
was
a
twice-continued
trial.
this
proceeding
was
originally
scheduled
for
trial
in
november
of
1984.
it
was
twice
postponed
at
the
defendant's
request.
and
yet
it
was
only
on
may
14,
the
first
day
of
trial,
that
counsel
says
in
utter...
not
present
counsel,
but
trial
counsel
says
in
utter
violation
of
the
rule,
i
want
to
educe
evidence
even
though
i
know
it
goes
against
the
statute.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
i
disagree
with
that,
with
all
respect,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
message
of
the
courts
of
michigan
are
quite
clear
that
preclusion
as
a
remedy
is
a
remedy
that
should
be
carefully
calibrated,
just
as
this
court
taught
in
cases
such
as
taylor
against
illinois.
i
think
his...
if
you
read
what
he
said,
what
judge
farmer
said,
the
transcript
can
be
read,
if
you
give
it
a
hard
reading,
to
suggest
automatic
preclusion.
i
would
suggest,
justice
stevens,
that
the
better,
more
appropriate,
and
fair
way
to
read
it
is
in
context
of
a
matter
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
was
a
complete
failure
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
at
a
critical
point.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
there
is...
the
specific
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is,
as
justice
o'connor
was
suggesting,
a
very
narrow
one.
is
this
kind
of
notice
requirement,
which
is
responsive
to
the
systemic
problem
of
this
kind
of
process,
operating
to
degrade
victims
of
crime?
is
this
notice
provision
unconstitutional
per
se
on
its
face
as
applied
to
this
kind
of
case?
and
the
answer
to
that
surely
is
no,
that
it's
not.
this
court
has
held
time
and
again
that
states
are
free
to
impose
reasonable
rules
so
as
to
order
their
criminal
proceedings,
and
a
notice
provision
was
specifically
upheld
21
years
ago
in
williams
against
florida.
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
filled
with
notice
provisions
that
must
be
complied
with.
a
notice
provision
is
in
fact
simply
a
way
of
ordering
the
procedure
so
that
a
determination
can
be
made
as
to
whether
this
evidence
is
admissible
or
not.
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
potential
here
that
some,
much
perhaps,
of
this
evidence
would
have
been
deemed
relevant
if
the
appropriate
proceedings
had
been
followed.
however,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
part
of
this
case,
this
evidence
is
not
the
critical
sort
of
evidence,
the
key
sort
of
evidence
that
has
troubled
this
court
in
cases
such
as
chambers
against
mississippi,
rock
against
arkansas,
and
the
like.
this
is
marginal
testimony
at
best,
and
the
reason
is
this.
this
was
tried
before
a
judge
who
was
operating
under
no
delusions.
he
could
not
have
been
operating
under
the
misimpression
that
there
was
in
fact
not
an
intimate
relationship
here.
the
victim
herself
testified
that
there
was
a
boyfriend-girlfriend
relationship
for--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
the
evidence...
i
simply
mean
that...
it
makes
none.
it's
simply
the
trier
of
fact,
which
in
this
instance
was
judge
farmer,
had
before
him
in
this
record
at
trial...
it
was
a
different
judge
in
the
preliminary
examination...
evidence
of
the
intimacy
of
the
relationship.
what...
the
evidence,
therefore,
that
was
sought
to
be
educed
was
in
fact
marginal.
and
the
key
point
is
this.
nothing
went
to
the
witnesses'
credibility,
nothing
went
to
bias.
it
is
not
like
this
court's
opinions
in
delaware
against
van
arsdall
and
other
cases
where
the
credibility
of
a
witness
is
on
the
line.
there
was
no
testimony--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--this
court,
in
reversing
a
state
trial
on
confrontation
clause
grounds,
has
looked
to
whether
this
was
critical
evidence.
that
is
exactly
the
term
the
court
used
in
chambers
against
mississippi,
and
i
think
that
is
sound.
the
court
looks
at
the
trial
to
see
whether
the
basic
confrontation
clause
value
was
achieved,
basic
sixth
amendment
values
of
whether
this
individual
was
able
to
put
his
case
before
the
trier
of
fact.
and
here
there
can
be
no
doubt,
a
fair
minded
reading
of
this
transcript
will
indicate
that
he
was
permitted
to
do
that,
including
cross-examining
the
victim
at
length.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
exactly
correct.
again,
the
issue--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
issue
is
very
narrow
as
to
whether
this
kind
of
notice
requirement,
which
is
found
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
is
unconstitutional
per
se.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
can--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
it
were
crucial
evidence
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
case
under
chambers--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
the
result
might
be
different.
that's
exactly
the
teaching
of
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
here.
this
evidence
was
in
fact
not
critical,
this
was
not...
no
one
was
kept
off
the
stand--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
quite
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
we
would
look
under
the
taylor
v.
illinois
analysis
to
the
entirety
of
the
circumstances
to
see
whether
preclusion,
which
is
a
serious
remedy,
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
can
be
under
this
court's--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
this
court
has
looked
to
the
importance
of
evidence,
including
more
recently
in
rock
against
arkansas.
the
point
i
would
close
with
is
this.
there
is
no
need
at
all
to
constitutionally
second
guess
state
court
judgments
where
in
fact
it
is
not
behaving,
the
state
court
is
not
behaving
in
an
arbitrary
way
and
imposing
a
remedy
that
is
disproportionate
to
the
violation.
and
here,
under
all
the
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
that
preclusion
is
not...
by
no
means
an
inappropriate
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you.
