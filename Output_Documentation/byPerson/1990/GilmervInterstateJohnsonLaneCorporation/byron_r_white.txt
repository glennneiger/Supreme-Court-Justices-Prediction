justice
white
was
the
exclusion
of
employment
contracts
argued
in
gardner-denver?
justice
white
and...
or
in
any
other
of
the
cases
that
we
have
dealt
with
in
the
employment
context?
justice
white
everybody
has
missed
it
up
until
this
very
case.
justice
white
how
is
your
client
engaged
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
white
no.
how
is
your
client
engaged
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
white
well,
how
was
he
himself
engaged
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
white
well
how
would
we
ever
decide
in
this
case
whether
that's
a
good
answer
to
your
claim
or
not?
justice
white
what
would
be
your
submission
as
to
why
your
client
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
white
in
1925
do
you
think
that
he
would
have
been
held
to
have
been
involved
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
white
maybe
his
actions
would
have...
might
effect
interstate
commerce,
but...
maybe
congress
these
days
has
the
power
to
regulate
what
he's
doing.
but
does
that
mean
that
in
1925
he
was
engaged
in--
justice
white
well,
is
that
all
there
is
to
it
here,
an
employment
agreement
between
your
client
and
his
employer?
didn't
he
want
to...
what
was
his
job?
justice
white
but
just
anybody
can't
do
that...
walk
in
off
the
street
and
do
it.
don't
they
have
to
register
with
the
exchange
and
pass
some...
aren't
they
subject
to
some
rules
of
the
exchange?
justice
white
well,
isn't
this
an
agreement,
sort
of
a
commercial
agreement
between
someone
who
wants
to
engage
in
that
industry
and
the...
and
the
private
regulatory
regime?
justice
white
was
he
required,
because
he
registered,
to
sign
this
sort
of
an
agreement
about
arbitration?
justice
white
was
he
required
by
the
exchange
to
sign
this
sort
of
agreement?
justice
white
and
so
he
agreed
to
that
when
he
wanted
into
the
business.
justice
white
i
know,
but
he
agreed
when
he...
if
they
were
going
to...
he
agreed,
in
order
to
be
permitted
to
do
it,
to
get
into
this
business,
he
registered
with
the
exchange,
didn't
he?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be.
that
may
be.
but
you
say
that
the
arbitration...
federal
arbitration
act
was
just,
just
limited
to
just
commercial
agreements.
justice
white
isn't
this
a
pretty
commercial
agreement,
if
somebody
wants
to
get
in
the
securities
business
and
he
has
to
register
and
live
up
to
their
rules?
justice
white
well
on
that
basis,
on
that
basis
you
would
say,
you
would
say
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
never
apply
to
these
sort
of
things.
justice
white
are
you
familiar
with
that
signal-stat
agreement,
or
case,
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
white
no.
signal-stat
corporation
against
local
475
in
1956,
a
decision
by
the
second
circuit.
justice
white
were
you
familiar
with
it?
justice
white
well,
that
case
held
that
employees
of
an
automobile
[inaudible]
weren't
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
section
1.
and
so
that
was
the
law
of
the
second
circuit.
everybody
knew
it,
i
suppose.
justice
white
so
it
isn't
the
first
time
this
issue
has
ever
been
raised.
justice
white
of
course,
we
denied
cert.
in
that
case.
maybe
unfortunately.
justice
white
no,
that's
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
justice
white
mr.
sherman,
was
that...
was
the
bird
case
an
employment
case?
justice
white
has
the
second
circuit
regularly
had
cases
dealing
with
employees
of
securities
companies?
justice
white
have
they
ever
adjudicated
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joined.
