justice
stevens
mr.
allred,
could
i
go
back
to
the
question
justice
scalia
asked
you
about
reconciling...
involving...
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce
in
section
2
and
engaged
in
commerce
in
section
1.
you
said
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
provides
a
good
answer
to
that
question.
do
you
which
amicus
brief?
we've
got
a
lot
of
them.
justice
stevens
mr.
spears,
i
gather
you're
arguing
that
the
contract
would
be
enforceable
even
if
there
were
no
federal
arbitration
act?
justice
stevens
it
mandates
enforcement
of
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce.
justice
stevens
what
is...
it
evident...
the
contract
evidence
the
hiring
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
now,
how
does
that...
that's
the
transaction
the
contract
evidences,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
are...
are
you
suing
for
enforcement
of
that?
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
were
suing
for
enforcement
of
the
provision
in
the
employment
contract.
justice
stevens
if
he
had
not
signed
an
employment
contract
would
you
still
have
the
same
claim?
justice
stevens
so
you're
not
relying
on
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
employment
contract?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
so
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
had
he
not
voluntarily
signed
this
contract,
the
result
would
be
the
same?
justice
stevens
well,
i
thought
you
were
relying
on
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
employment
agreement.
and
i
think
now
you're
telling
me
you're
not.
justice
stevens
so
your
answer
is
that
the
transaction
involving
commerce
was
his
agreement
to
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
exchange?
his
application
for...
his
registration
is
the
transaction--
justice
stevens
--and
the
involving
commerce...
i
see.
what
did
the
exchange
agree
to
do
in
exchange
for
his
promise?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that's
running
through
my
mind,
while
you're
looking
for
it,
if
the
transaction
involving
commerce
is
his
entitlement
to
engage
in
buying
and
selling
over
the
exchange,
why
isn't
he
then
a
person
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
stevens
he
is
a
person
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
stevens
and
it
involves
commerce
because
he
then
becomes
a
person
engaged
in
commerce,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
which
then
brings
him
squarely
within
the
language
of
section
1.
justice
stevens
and
section
1.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
not
the
way
you
just
described
it
and
explained
it
to
me.
justice
stevens
you
want
to
change
your
explanation,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
--what
about
the
mcdonald
case?
that
was
a
statutory
right
issue.
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
said
the
difference
in
gardner-denver
was
they
didn't
resolve
the
statutory
issue?
and
then
i
asked
you
about
a
statutory
case
and
you
say
they're
exactly
the
same.
justice
stevens
mr.
spears,
can
i
ask
you
this?
would
your
position
not
be
precisely
the
same
if
a
nonunion
employer
just
required
all
his
employees
to
agree
to
arbitrate
any
dispute?
statutory,
civil
rights,
or
anything
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
if
they're
engaged
in
commerce,
yeah.
so
you
don't
really
need...
i
mean,
i
understand
it
strengthens
your
case,
but
i
think
your
basic
position
is
that,
absent
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
an
employer-employee
agreement
to
arbitrate
all
disputes,
including
statutory
disputes,
is
enforceable?
i
think
that's
really
what
it
comes
down
to,
isn't
it?
and
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong,
but--
justice
stevens
--i
think
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
stevens
right.
