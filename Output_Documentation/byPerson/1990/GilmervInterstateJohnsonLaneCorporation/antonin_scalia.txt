justice
scalia
do
you
think
your
client
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
the
way
a
railroad
worker
or
seaman
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce?
part
of
the--
justice
scalia
--well,
i
think
he's
effecting
interstate
commerce.
i'm
not
sure
he's
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
scalia
but
the
first
part
is
the
part
we're
talking
about,
right?
section
1?
justice
scalia
and
that
does
say
engaged
in.
justice
scalia
seamen
or
railroad
workers
or
any
other
person
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
scalia
this
was
enacted,
of
course,
in
when?
when
was...
1925,
is
that
when
it
was
passed?
justice
scalia
and
the
country
had,
or
the
congress
had
a
quite
different
view
of
what
interstate
commerce
was
in
those
days.
i
guess
we
did,
too.
justice
scalia
mr.
allred,
one
thing
that
sort
of
suggests
that
your
expansive
notion
of
engaged
in
interstate
concept
may
be
wrong
is
that,
although
section
1
uses
the
term
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
section
2,
the
operative
provision
here,
says
it
applies
to
a
written
provision
in
any
maritime
transaction
or
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce.
now,
why
would
congress
say
involving
commerce
in
section
2,
and
say
engaged
in
commerce
in
section
1,
without
intending
a
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
scalia
i
hope
so.
justice
scalia
you
can
have
a
transaction
between
people
engaged
in
commerce,
or
a
transaction
among
people
engaged
in
commerce,
or
a
transaction
concerning
people
engaged
in
commerce.
don't
you
think?
justice
scalia
on
the
contrary
[inaudible]
in
section
1
if
they
meant
the
same
thing
they
could
have
referred
to
employees
engaged
in
any
business
affecting
commerce
or
in
any
business
involving
commerce.
justice
scalia
it's
a
very
strange
way
to
say
it
if
they
meant
the
same
thing.
justice
scalia
you
mean
only
corporations,
it
applied...
it
was
meant
to
imply
only
to
corporations
or
partnerships,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
what
about
other
kinds
of
rights?
is
it
all
statutory
rights
that
are
not
covered
by
the
arbitration
act,
or
what?
what
is
your
position?
justice
scalia
but
just
employees?
nobody
else?
what
about
the
sherman
act,
for
example,
a
dispute
about
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
two
businessmen--
justice
scalia
--but
that's
a
public
policy,
just
as
employment
discrimination
is
a
public
policy.
people
shouldn't
be
able
to
get
out
of
that
any
easier
than
they
get
out
of
employment
discrimination,
i
guess.
should
they?
justice
scalia
your
client
agreed
here.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
civil
rights?
i
mean,
it's
not
a
right
of
his
against
the
government?
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
i
see,
but
not--
justice
scalia
--now,
what
do
you
rest
that
principle
on?
i
mean,
what
i
don't
understand...
see,
i
can
understand
a
principle
that
if
it's
a
public
policy
you
can't
arbitrate
out
of
it.
but
you're
not...
you're
not
willing
to
say
that.
you
just...
you're
just
going
to
say
certain
public
policies,
but
what's
the
basis
for
distinguishing
this
kind
of
public
policy
from
other
kinds
of
public
policies?
justice
scalia
does
it
sign
the--
justice
scalia
--does
he
sign
the
agreement...
does
the
exchange
sign
the
agreement,
too,
and
he
keeps
a
copy
and
they
keep
a
copy?
is
that
what
happens?
justice
scalia
it's
not
in
your
appendix.
it
must
be
somewhere
else.
is
it
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
scalia
did
the
arbitration
in
gardner-denver
purport
to
determine
the
statutory
issue?
i
thought
it
was
purely
an
arbitration
about
the
contract
dispute
and
not
about
any
statutory
violation?
justice
scalia
is
that
what
you've
been
saying?
i
didn't--
justice
scalia
i
thought...
wasn't
the
statutory
issue
submitted
to
the
arbitrator
in
mcdonald?
i
thought
it
was.
justice
scalia
i
thought
it
was.
but
at
least
it's
similar
to
alexander
in
that
it
involved
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
so
that
the
person
who
had
agreed
to
the
arbitration
was
not
the
individual
who
was...
whose
statutory
right
had
allegedly
been
taken
away.
justice
scalia
but
rather
somebody
else
purporting
to
act
on
that
individual's
behalf.
