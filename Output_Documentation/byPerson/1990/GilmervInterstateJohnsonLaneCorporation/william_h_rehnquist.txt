chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-18,
robert
d.
gilmer
v.
interstate/johnson
lane
corporation.
mr.
allred.
chief
justice
rehnquist
gardner-denver
was
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
there
was
no
evidence
taken
in
the
trial
court
on
this
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
you
hadn't
raised
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
contention
that
your
client
did
not
knowingly
agree
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
that
was
a
contention
you
made
in
the
district
court,
that
he
did
not,
he
did
not
knowingly
agree
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
quite
different
than
saying
he
didn't
knowingly
do
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
still
don't
understand
your
contention,
mr.
allred.
you
say
that
your
client
of
course
signed
the
agreement
and
that
he
didn't
really
know
what
its
full
effect
would
be?
is
that
your
contention?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how
did
the
lower
courts
resolve...
we
didn't
grant
certiorari
on
that
question,
did
we?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
and
so
don't,
don't
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
the
question
before
this
court
that
your
client
did
knowingly
sign
the
agreement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
true
in
the
mcmahon
case,
too.
anyone
making
a
deal
with
the
brokers
had
to
sign
the
same
sort
of
agreement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well...
does
the
federal
arbitration
act
make
the
sort
of
distinction
you're
talking
about,
do
you
think?
is
that
what
section
1
means?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
allred.
mr.
spears,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
spears,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
a
statute
passed
that
says
someone
has
to
sue.
they're
all
couched
in
that
language.
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
point
then
is
that
the
act
puts
it
in
the
hands
of
the
aggrieved
individual,
rather
than
of
some
agency
or
board?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
spears,
wouldn't
the
arbitration
award
be
subject
to
some
minimum
form
of
judicial
review
after
it
were
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
i'm
wondering
whether
your
analysis
is
accurate.
you
point
to
the
delay...
are
you
just
talking
about
administrative
delays
before
a
case
goes
to
the
court
where
you
are
simply
suing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
going
to
have...
litigation
itself
would
certainly
describe
what
you
have
when
an
arbitration
award
is
reviewed,
wouldn't
you?
i
mean,
you
have
an
action,
the
district
court
to
review
the
award.
if
the
people
are
dissatisfied
they
could
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
more
limited
inquiry?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
you
say
is
the
principal
distinguishing
feature
between
gardner-denver
and
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
spears.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-18
gilmer
versus
interstate
johnson
lane
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
