mr.
john
t.
allred
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
cert.
was
granted
in
this
case
on
whether
a
claim
for
violation
in
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
is
subject
to
compulsory
arbitration.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
arbitration
agreement
in
an
application
for
employment
was
enforceable
and
denied
mr.
gilmer
access
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
alleged
age
act
violation.
this
case
focuses
on
a
conflict
between
two
national
policies.
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
policy
of
favoring
arbitration
that
has
been
announced
in
mitsubishi
and
its
trilogy,
and
then
on
the
other
hand
is
the
national
policy
of
eradicating
employment
discrimination
in
the
work
place.
mr.
john
t.
allred
yes--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
because
in
the...
first
off,
we
thought
that
the
mitsubishi...
i
mean,
that
the
gardner-denver
line
of
cases
were
dispositive
of
the
federal
arbitration
issue,
and
in
fact...
and
we...
we
looked
at
tenney,
the
circuit
court
case,
and
the
cases
that
followed
that,
and
we
did
not
appreciate
the
importance
of
that
argument.
in
looking
at
the
briefs
from
the
afl-cio
and
the
aarp
and
the
other
amicus
we
are
convinced
that
it
is
indeed
a
compelling
argument.
mr.
john
t.
allred
we
think--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--justice
o'connor,
we
think
that
the
enforceability
of
the
agreement
under
the
faa...
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
federal
arbitration
act,
you
of
necessity
have
to
look
at
section
1.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that
issue
is
subsumed
within
the
entire
question
that
is
before
this
court.
and...
and
as,
and
as
you
look
at
that
particular
issue
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
language
of
section
1
that
says
that
workers...
that
all
classes
of
workers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
are
excluded
from
the
act
is
dispositive
of
the
question
on
the
basis
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
but
furthermore,
when
you
look
at
the...
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
which
when...
was
gone
into
in
great
detail
in
the
brief
of
the
afl-cio,
it
was...
it
showed
to
me
beyond
all
question
that
it
was
intended
that
employment
contracts
or
employment
disputes
were
to
be
excluded,
and
that
the
sole
purpose
in
1925
of
the
faa
was
that
business
people
who
wanted
to
get
together
and
agree
to
arbitrate
their
disputes,
that
that
would
be
enforceable.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
i
think...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
referred
to
seamen
and
railroads
because
those
were
basically
the
two
union
groups
that
were
lobbying
for
the
exclusion,
but
the
language
went
on
further
and
said...
it
mentioned
those
two
groups
but
then
went
further
and
said
all
classes
of
workers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
tenney
case,
which
limited
that
to
transportation,
is
really
just,
was...
at
least
in
retrospect
it
appears
that
that
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
legislative
history
that
this
court
has.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well...
well,
to
the
extent
that
money
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
a
seaman
or
a
transportation
worker
is
not
carrying
goods,
so
to
speak,
but
money
is
indeed
a
part
of
interstate
commerce.
and
so
i
don't...
i
would
not
believe
that
that
statute
is
to
be
that
strictly
interpreted.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that...
if
you
look
at
the
first...
at
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
it
didn't...
it
didn't
really
use
the
word
engage,
as
i
recall.
engage
was
in
the
second
part.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--section
1,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
it
seems
like
to
me
that
if
you
are
working
in
interstate
commerce,
you
are
indeed
engaged
in
it.
perhaps
that
may
be
too
simplistic,
but
at
least...
at
least
that's
the
way
it
strikes
me.
if--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
may
well
be.
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
hasn't
really
come
into
any
real
prominence
until
just
recently.
in
fact,
many
of
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
whether...
with
whether
or
not
a
compulsory
arbitration
agreement
is
enforceable
has
not
even
addressed
the
federal
arbitration
act,
just
as
the
gardner-denver
and
the
line
of
cases
did.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
only
the
substance
in
which
the
issue
arose
in
that
case,
because...
because
there
the...
what
justice
powell
said
in
there
related
to
title
vii
and
employment
discrimination.
the
fact
that
it
arose
in
a
collective
bargaining
context
i
don't
think
is
any
disparity
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
arbitration
agreement
that
was
involved
in
gardner-denver
came
about
through
equal
bargaining
power
of
the
negotiation
between
the
union
on
the
one
hand
and
management
on
the
other
to
reach
that.
when
mr.
gilmer
and
the
likes
of
mr.
gilmer
go
to
work
for
the
securities
industry,
there
is
no
equal
bargaining
power
there.
they
have
no
choice.
they
either...
they
either
agree
to
that
arbitration--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
no,
that...
that
is
true.
but
what
was
addressed--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--what
was
addressed
in
gardner-denver
was
the
fact
that
when
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
title
vii,
that
congress
was
acting
to
correct
an
enormous
national
wrong
that
had
gone
on
for
many
years.
age
was
not
included
in
title
vii,
but
it
was
mentioned
in
a
good
bit
of
the
legislative
history,
and
for
whatever
reason
it
was
not
picked
up
until
1967
when
the
adea
was
adopted.
and...
but
when
the
adea
was
adopted,
it
picked
up,
basically
as
this
court
has
said,
title
vii
in
hoc
verba,
and
this
court
has
said
that
when
you
look
at
precedents
in...
for
cases
involving
age
discrimination,
you
should
look
at
title
vii
because
you're
dealing
with
the
same
sort
of
insidious
discrimination.
we
think
that
from
the
gardner-denver
line
of
cases
that
you
have...
that...
there
were
two
things
that
really
prompted
the
court
to
operate
there,
was,
one,
was
the
special
characteristic
of
employment
relationship
that
existed,
that...
that...
and
only...
and
congress
felt
that
only
the
courts
and
the
procedure
that...
or
the
adoption
of
the
eeoc
were
the
way
in
which
that
you
could
address
that.
when--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--how
would
i
define
engaged--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--oh,
well...
well,
he
was
manager
of,
he
was
hired
as
manager
of
financial
services
for
interstate
securities.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
the
record...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that,
but
he
was
involved
in
the
sale
of
mutual
funds.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
what
happened
before
judge
mcmillan
was
that
they
moved
to
dismiss.
and
we
looked
at
gardner-denver,
and
gardner-denver
said,
and
the
cases
that
followed
that
said,
that
whenever
title
vii
or
whenever
civil
rights,
or
whenever
some...
any
form
of
employment--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--what
would
be
my
submission?
well,
that
he
was
managing
a
group
of
people
that
bought
and...
that
sold
mutual
funds.
and
mutual
funds,
the--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
now,
if
you
looked
at
it
from
a
narrow
standpoint
that
engaged
meant
that
you
had
to
be
physically
engaged,
you
had
to
be
driving
a
bus
or
a
truck
or
in
the
transportation
industry,
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
i
don't...
but
it
seems
like
to
me
that
if
you
were
in
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
you
were
selling
general
motors
stock
that
emanated
from
detroit,
that
that
broker,
that
the
people
in
the
investment
banking
industry
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
just...
we
read
the
gardner-denver
line
of
cases
and
saw
that
this
court
has
held
that
whenever
employment
discrimination
is
at
issue,
that
arbitration
is
inappropriate,
and
that
the
courts
and
the
eeoc
are
the...
is
the
way
to
go.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
your
honor,
there's
a
good
answer
to
that--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--in
one
of
the
briefs.
the...
but
i
think
that
you
can't,
on
the
one
hand,
have
the
situation
that
says
that
you
are
going
to
allow
transactions
in
commerce
to
be
subjected
to
compulsory
arbitration,
and
then
eliminate
those
that
are
engaged
in
that
same
activity.
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
you
have
to
read
both
of
those
together.
that
if...
that
if
transactions
in
commerce
involve
that,
then
engaged
in
commerce
was...
that
you
have
to
read
both
sections
equally.
but
maybe
your
honor,
the
transactions
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
see,
we
submit
that
from
the
gardner-denver
line,
that
that's
dispositive.
we
think
that
federal
arbitration
act
is
dispositive
of
section
1.
but
we
also
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
mitsubishi
test
and
its
cases,
it
said
that
you
reached
the
same
result.
there
they
say...
mitsubishi
said
that
you
will
enforce
the
federal
arbitration
agreement
unless
congress
has
manifested
a
contrary
intent.
and
then,
i
think
it
was
the
mcmahon
case,
said
that
you
can
look
at
the
manifest
intent
of
congress
wherein
something
is
inherently
contradictory
to
the
act
itself.
i
think
that
was
mcmahon.
and
here
congress,
in
title
vii
and
in
the
age
act,
manifested
its
intent
that
the
federal
court
is
an
integral
part
of
the...
of
instrument
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
designed
to
eradicate
discrimination
based
on
age,
race,
sex,
and
religion.
and
there
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict,
we
see,
in
the
arbitration
process
and
the
enforcement
of
these
civil
rights
laws.
mr.
john
t.
allred
i
think
that
that
was
the
afl-cio
addressed
that.
i
believe
it
was
also
addressed
in
the
lawyers'
committee.
and...
maybe
i'll
have
an
answer
for
you
before
i
sit
down.
at
page
13
of
the
afl-cio
brief
the...
it
is
said,
"we
note
at
the
outset
that
the
different
syntactical
contexts
of
the
two
references
to
"commerce"
mean
that
use
of
precisely
the
same
connective
in
the
two
circumstances
would
have
created
a
grammatical
problem:
a
"transaction"
could
not
be
said
to
be
"engaged
in"
commerce,
nor
would
a
reference
to
a
"class
of
workers"
as
"involving
commerce"
make
sense.
"
"thus,
there
is
no
necessary
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
simple
fact
that
a
different
connective
was
used
in
the
two
contexts.
"
mr.
john
t.
allred
indeed.
i
think
that
you
could
probably
have
a
transaction
between
two
people
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
transaction
was
not
a
commerce
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
t.
allred
i--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--but
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
though,
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
it
was
designed
only
for
the
business
entities,
where,
when
they
got
together
and
made
their
contracts
there
to
buy,
sell,
or
what
have
you,
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
their
dispute.
and
we
are
involved
in
arbitration
a
great
deal.
and
they
work
extraordinarily
well--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--no,
no,
no.
i
can
apply...
it
applies
to
individuals.
but
we're
talking
about
a
knowing,
a
knowing
agreement
to
decide
that
if
you
have
a
dispute
over
your
given...
your
given
contract,
that
you
decided
at
the
outset
that
you
would
arbitrate
rather
than
go
to
court.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
t.
allred
i
did
not...
i
did
not
say
that
he...
we
were
relying
on
fraud
in
the
district
court.
i
am
saying
that
he
had
no
choice--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--well,
he
knew
he
signed
a
clause
that
said
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange
he
would
agree
to
arbitrate
his
disputes,
but
he
had
no
idea
that
it
would
rely
to
any
sort
of
civil
rights
that
he
had,
when
congress
has
passed
a
law,
and
under
the
age
act,
that
says
he's
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
that
says
that
the
eeoc
has
all
of
this...
all
of
this
process
there
to
investigate,
to
conciliate.
and
then
under
the
age
act,
may
be
because
age
is
so
paramount,
if
the
eeoc
has
not
acted
within
60
days,
then
he
may
go
ahead
and
elect
to
bring
suit.
mr.
john
t.
allred
it's
my
contention
that
he
had
no
idea
that
it
would
waive
his
right
if
he
were
discriminated
against
by...
on--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--you
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
compulsory
arbitration
is...
will...
is
available
here,
can
be
enforceable
here.
mr.
john
t.
allred
i
have
a
hard
time...
yeah,
you
can
certainly
make
that
assumption,
but
our
position
is
that
as
relates
to
the
securities
industry,
that
this...
the
entire
security
industry
has...
if
you
go
to
work
for
them,
then
you
have
to
sign
this
agreement.
mr.
john
t.
allred
but
the
difference
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
that
person
dealing
with
the
broker
could
walk
away,
and
that
was
a
business
relationship
and
not
an
employment
relationship.
and...
it
is
true
that
mr.
gilmer
could
walk
away,
but
if
he
wanted
to
go
to
work
in
the
securities
industry
he
had
no
choice
but
to
sign
that
agreement.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
i
think,
the
way
in
which
i
read
section
1
is
that...
is
that
any
employment
dispute,
whether
it's
contract
or
not,
is
excluded
from
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
john
t.
allred
his...
he
was
hired
as
manager--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
it
may
be
a
commercial
agreement
to
the
extent
as
it
relates
to
the
buying
and
selling
of
securities,
and
that's
what
the
sec
and
the
srr
was
all
about.
mr.
john
t.
allred
i
missed...
i
did
not
get
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
that
relates
to
the
regulation
of
the
buying
and
selling
of
securities.
mr.
john
t.
allred
indeed
he
did.
indeed
he
did,
your
honor.
but
the...
but
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
not
that
body
of
law
that's
designed
to
look
after
civil
rights
for
people
who
are
discriminated
against
in
age.
mr.
john
t.
allred
that's
what
the
legislative
history--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--well,
discrimination
by
age,
your
honor,
or
discrimination
by
sex
or
religion
or
race,
it
seems
to
me
is
not
commercial.
and
that's--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--i
think
that
that's
the
way
section
1
reads,
literally,
and
i
think
that's
the
way
the
legislative
history
of
section
1
reads.
in
mcdonald
v.
city
of
west
branch,
a
case
decided
in
1984,
just
1
year
before
mitsubishi,
this
court
said
although
arbitration
is
well
suited
to
resolving
contractual
disputes,
it
cannot
provide
an
adequate
substitute
for
judicial
proceeding
in
protecting
the
federal
statutory
and
constitutional
rights
that
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
was
designed
to
safeguard.
and
i
would
add
to
that,
and
the
other
civil
rights.
and
in
the
mcmahon
case
they
said
that
if
the...
if
the
enforcement
scheme
is
inherently
in
conflict...
if
the
statutory
right
is
inherently
in
conflict
with
the
arbitration
agreement,
then
you're
not
required
to
do
it.
and
mitsubishi
said
if
you
look
at
congressional
intent,
whether
it's
legislative
history
or
whether
it's
the
whole
scheme
of
enforcement,
i
want...
this
court
well
knows
the
entire
scheme
of
the
eeoc,
that
of
filing
a
charge,
and
of
its
duty
to
investigate
and
to
conciliate.
and
even...
and
congress
did
not
do...
make
what
the
eeoc
did
binding.
that
even
if
they
found
that
there
was
no
probable
cause,
the
individual
was
still
entitled
to
have
access
to
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
allred
mitsubishi
was
the
case
that
involved--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--i'm--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--no.
no,
i'm
not
familiar
with
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
tenney
held--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--no,
but
it's...
there
was
a
case
before
this
court,
i
believe
in
1988,
in
which
neither
side
briefed
it.
that
involved
a
california
statute.
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--the
one
that
i
was
referring
to,
i
think
it
was
potter,
was
that
it
held
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
preempted
a
state
law.
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
section
1
was
involved
was
not
briefed
by
the
parties
in
that
case.
the...
the...
one...
arbitration
just
clearly
is
not
the
sort
of
vehicle
by
which
employment
discrimination
rights
can
be
vindicated.
there...
i
can
go
through
a
whole
litany
of--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--well,
as
i
read...
as
i
read...
as
i
read
the
cases,
your
honor,
it's
those
cases
in
which
the...
when
the
congress
has
passed
laws
protecting
employees
with
minimum
statutory
standards,
minimum
rights,
like--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--well,
that's
covered
precisely
by
the...
by
the
faa.
if
the
two
businessmen
have
agreed
to
arbitrate,
then
it's
therefore
enforceable.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
what
the...
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
those
cases.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
i
don't
think
he
made...
he
agreed
to
arbitrate
any...
he
agreed,
in
my
judgment,
to
arbitrate
disputes
with
respect
to
new
york
stock
exchange
rules,
with
respect
to
things
of
that
nature,
but
not
his
civil
rights.
and
i
just
don't
think
that
that...
that
that
was
a
knowing
waiver.
mr.
john
t.
allred
what
i
mean
by
civil
rights
is
to
be
free
from
discrimination
because
of
your
age,
because
of
your
race--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--because
of
your
sex.
mr.
john
t.
allred
religion.
mr.
john
t.
allred
well,
because
congress
passed
the
law
doing
it,
and
then
passed
this
intricate
scheme
for
the
enforcement
of
it.
and
as
congress
recognized
in
the
norris-laguardia
act,
and
i
think
this
is
important
here,
and
this
is
in
the
act
itself,
it
said
the
individual
unorganized
worker
is
commonly
helpless
to
exercise
actual
liberty
of
contract
and
to
protect
his
freedom
of
labor,
and
thereby
obtain
acceptable
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
if
this
court
affirms
the
fourth
circuit,
then
the
securities
industry
has
foreclosed
the
courthouse
door
to
any
person
who
contends
that
they
have
been
discriminated
against
by
virtue
of
any
civil
rights
act,
title
vii,
age.
and
other
industries
will
indeed
then
have
as
a
condition
of
employment
that
you
will
agree
to
arbitrate.
and
i
think
that
it
will
basically
be
the
death
knell
of
civil
rights
as
started
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
this
court
will
do
that,
because
arbitration
is
suitable
for
handling
business
disputes,
and
handling
business
disputes
between
people
knowingly
made
the
decision
to
opt
at
the
outset
to--
mr.
john
t.
allred
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
was...
it
was
just
as
the
norris
laguardia
act.
it
was
not
knowing
as
relates
to
being
discriminated
against
because
of
age.
it
was...
in
the
context
in
which
you
referred
to
it,
it
was
knowing
as
relates
to
being
employed
in
the
securities
industry,
and
agreeing
to
arbitrate
any
disputes
that
he
might
have
with
his
employer
over
the
employment,
but
not
with
respect
to
title
vii
or
with
respect
to
the
age
act.
