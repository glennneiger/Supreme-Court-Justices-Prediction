justice
o'connor
mr.
allred,
don't
you
have
a
preceding
question,
which
is
whether
the
federal
arbitration
act
even
applies--
justice
o'connor
--in
this
case?
now,
i
take
it
you
didn't
argue
that
below?
that
was
not
relied
upon
by
you
below?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
we
should
address
it
here
in
this
court,
and
are
you
prepared
to
have
us
do
so?
justice
o'connor
and
to
argue
the
issue?
justice
o'connor
why
do
you
suppose
the
congress
referred
expressly
to
seamen
and
railroad
workers
if
the
last
phrase
dealing
with
those
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
would
have
covered
all
of
those
categories?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
the
allegation
here
that
this
individual
knowingly
agreed
to
arbitration?
i
mean,
that's
how
we
take
the
case,
as
the
chief
justice
inquired
about
earlier.
don't
we
have...
don't
we
have
to
accept
the
case
on
that
premise
and
go
from
there?
justice
o'connor
mr.
spears,
do
the
arbitrators
have
the
power
to
award
the
kind
of
systemic
relief
that
might
be
available
in
court
under
the
adea?
justice
o'connor
how
about
a
class
action?
