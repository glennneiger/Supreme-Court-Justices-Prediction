mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
text
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
age
act,
are
silent
as
to
any
congressional
intent
to
prohibit
arbitration.
the
faa
in
that
circumstance
mandates
arbitration
unless
there
exists
an
inherent
and
irreconcilable
conflict
between
arbitration
and
the
purposes
of
that
age
act.
that's
the
issue
for
this
court
to
decide.
such
a
conflict
cannot
be
shown
here.
indeed,
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
agreement
here
complements
the
adea's
purposes.
a
comparison
of
the
act's
purposes
with
arbitration
eliminates
a
concern
about
any
conflict
existing.
the
act's
purposes
are
contained
in
section
2(b)
of
the
act.
they
are
threefold.
number
one,
to
promote
the
employment
of
older
workers;
number
two,
prohibit
arbitrary
age
discrimination;
and
number
three,
to
help
employers
and
employees
find
ways
of
meeting
the
problems
impacted
with
regard
to
age.
the
choice
of
arbitration
clearly
does
not
conflict
with
any
of
these
purposes.
to
the
contrary,
the
enforcement
of
the
provisions...
the
enforcement
provisions
chosen
by
congress
shows
that
it
preferred
that
multiple
methods
be
available
to
employers
and
employees
in
meeting
problems
under
that
act.
as
one
alternative,
congress
provided
for
court
enforcement.
noteworthy
they
provided
for
court
enforcement
in
any
court
or
competent
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
restricted
to
the
federal
courts.
it
is
very
similar
to
the
'33
securities
act
which
this
court
addressed
in
the
rodriguez
case.
this
court
commented
that
the
wider
choice
of
court
provision
in
that
statute
indicated
a
congressional
intent
of
allowing
wider
choice
of
alternatives
for
resolving
claims
under
that
act.
before
any
litigation,
what
does
congress
provide?
congress
expressly
favors
in
the
statute...
resolution
of
disputes
through
voluntary
means.
the
conciliation,
conference,
and
persuasion
mandated
in
the
statute
by
congress
are
certainly
more
akin
to
arbitration
than
they
are
to
litigation.
in
fact,
congress
provides
for
resolution
of
disputes
in
multiple
administrative
and
judicial
forum.
it's
not
just
limited
to
the
courts.
congress
never
said
if
you've
got
an
age
claim
you
have
to
go
immediately
to
the
court.
an
individual,
of
course,
is
required
to
file
an
eeoc
charge,
but
beyond
that
requirement,
he
is
allowed
to
leave
it
with
the
eeoc
for
them
to
attempt
conciliation.
the
individual
can
file
a
claim
with
the
state
or
local
agencies.
and
as
noted
previously,
he
can
also
file
a
state
or
federal
lawsuit.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
the
federal
arbitration
act
mandates
enforcement
of
it
unless
there's
a
contrary
indication
in
the
statute,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
and
this
clearly
is.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
it's
not
limited
to
that,
your
honor.
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
there's
a
requirement
here.
this
is
a...
one...
i'm
sorry,
justice
white,
excuse
me.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
i
apologize,
your
honor,
but
i
was
trying
to
refer
to
your
comments
earlier
today--
that
the
registration
agreement
here
is
at
the
minimum
and
probably
more
than
a
three-party
agreement.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
it's
enforceable
either
way.
it
doesn't
matter--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--no.
the
arbitration
clause
is
part
of
the
rules.
the
arbitration
clause
is
imposed
by
the...
by
the...
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
the
arbitration
clause
is
in
his
registration
agreement.
there
is
no
separate
written
employment
agreement.
the
arbitration
clause...
agreement,
is
in
the
registration
agreement
with
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
which,
by
the
way,
the
company
is
required
to
get
him
to
agree
to.
to
allow
him
to
engage
in
a
transaction
involving
the
buying
and
selling
of
securities,
congress
mandates...
i'm
sorry,
the

requires
that
anyone
that
is
allowed
that
privilege
has
to
become

and
by
becoming
registering
agrees
to
abide
by
the
constitution
and
rules
as...
which
includes
the
requirement
of
arbitrating
any
dispute.
rule
345,
with
regard
to
the
concern
about
any
voluntariness
here,
rule
345
says,
it
is
quoted
at
page
1
of
our
appendix,
that
any
controversy
between
a
representative
and
any
member
or
member
organization
arising
out
of
the
employment
or
termination
of
employment,
as
such
registered
representative
shall
be
settled
by
arbitration
at
the
instance
of
either
party.
either
party
could
enforce
this.
it's
not
limited
to
the
company.
he
himself
has
a
right
to
enforce
this.
but
aside
from
the
employment
relationship,
this
is
a
business
contract
that
relates
between
at
least
the
three
party
and
even
outside
parties.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
is
the
contract
evidencing
the
transaction
involving
commerce.
yes.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
agreed
to
allow
him
to
buy
and
sell
securities,
or
have
any
involvement
with
that.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
and
they
also
allowed
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
arbitration
benefits
here
also.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
it
comes
down
from
the
exchange
as
the
rules.
they
are
the
superior
or
proven
authority
here.
it
is
signed,
coincidentally,
justice
scalia,
by
a
representative
from
the
company.
it
is
called
a
u-4
form.
it
appears
at
page
13
of
our
appendix.
it
is
signed
by--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--he
is,
by
virtue
of
this
agreement.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
he
is
not
only...
he...
his
contract,
his
agreement
to
be
bound
by
arbitration
and
all
the
other
rules
of
the
exchange
is
the
contract
involved
in
the
transaction
involving
commerce.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
if
he
relates
to
a
transaction
involving
commerce.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
well,
section
2.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
well,
with
regard
to
that,
i
think
the
difference
in
the
language
that
was
noted
intends
a
broad
application
of
section
2
and
a
narrow,
restrictive
application
of
section
1
exclusion.
i
think
that
difference
there
means
something--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--well,
i--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--well,
i
guess
i'll
have
to,
your
honor,
because
i...
i'm
more
convinced
that
the
difference
in
the
language
gives
an
expansive
reading,
and
indeed
the
courts
have
applied
an
expansive,
have
given
the
faa
an
expansive
reach,
not
a
constricted
reach.
this
court
in
perry
v.
thomas
enforced
the
very
form,
the
u-4
application
form
involved
in
this
case.
by
the
way,
i
found
now
that--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
it
is
the
joint
appendix
at
page
14.
it's
signed
by
harry
m.
boyd,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
company,
which
agrees
not
to
employ
him
unless
he,
unless
he
becomes
registered
as
required
by
the
law.
so
the
company,
above
signing
this,
but
it
is
signed
by
the
company,
is
also
bound
by
the
rules
and
the
restrictions
included
in
the
arbitration
agreement
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
now,
returning
to
the
issue
that
i
believe
is
before
the
court,
the...
section
7
of
the
age
act
provides
than
an
aggrieved
citizen
may
bring
a
civil
action
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
it's
not
mandatory.
this
is
permissible
language.
indeed,
as
judge--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--exactly.
well...
your
honor,
and
in...
in
the
mitsubishi
case
this
court
noted
the
fact
that
the
statute,
i
think
it
was
the
sherman
act,
did
not
require
an
individual
to
bring
a
lawsuit
as
indicative
of
the
choices
that
were
available.
i
think
it's
at
473
u.s.
at
page
637.
it
was
noted
in
mitsubishi
that
the
fact
that...
for
example,
there
are
some
administrative
procedures
required
by
congress
where
the
individual
has
no
control
over
that,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
for
example.
that
is
solely
up
to
the
nlrb.
and
section
10(a)
of
the
nlra
says
that
there
are
no
agreement
between
any
parties
can
divest
or
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb.
that
is
a
special
situation,
and
therefore
the
faa
could
not
enforce
any
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
that
act.
but
the
contrast
is
important
there.
the
difference
between
the
sherman
act,
the
rico
statutes,
the
two
securities
acts,
that
allows
any
individual...
that
allows
an
aggrieved
individual
to
go
not
only
into
federal
court
but
to
any
court--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
and
gives
them
a
choice
to
go
to
court
or
not
go
to
court.
i
guess
that
more
precisely
makes
my
point.
to
choose
other
fora
that
are
available.
this
includes,
of
course,
private
settlements.
they
are
allowed
under
the
age
act.
another
example
is,
of
course,
arbitration.
they
are
encouraged
by
the
faa.
and
arbitration
is
not
mentioned
in
the
statute.
under
mcmahon
it
is
not
necessary
to
mention
it
in
the
statute.
significantly,
congress
has
not
eliminated
arbitration
as
an
alternative
under
the
age
act.
the
silence
of
the
age
act
we
think
is
significant.
indeed,
the
need
for
more
alternatives
to
litigation
is
ever
increasing
in
this
country.
even
as
far
back
as
1967
when
congress
passed
the
law,
they
noted
in
section
2
of
the
act
that
the
numbers
of
auto
workers
are
"great
and
growing".
more
recently,
according
to
a
u.s.
census
bureau
report
quoted
in
one
of
our
amicus
briefs,
by
the
year
2000,
20
percent
of
our
population
will
be
55
or
older.
by
the
year
2030,
almost
33
percent
will
be
55
or
older.
now,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
is
having
difficulties...
in
fact
they're
having
difficulties
managing
the...
their
work
load
now
of
eeoc
charges
involving
age
claims.
imagine
how
much
more
difficult
it's
going
to
be.
noted
in
one
of
our
amicus
briefs,
in
the
harvard
law
review
report...
article,
104
of
harvard
law
review,
a
startling
fact
where
the
former
chairman
of
the
commission,
clarence
thomas,
in
1988,
where
the
commission
reported
that
it
may
have
mishandled
as
many
as
over
7,500
complaints
of
age
discrimination
over
the
previous
5
years
by
failing
to
act
on
them
before
the
2-year
statute
of
limitation
ran.
congress'
silence
says
something.
it
says
there
ought
to
be
these
alternatives
available
for
individuals
to
resolve
these
claims.
they
shouldn't
be
restricted
to
only
going
to
court.
arbitration
can
clearly
help
mitigate
these
problems.
older
workers
don't
have
as
much
time
to
wait
for
a
remedy.
extended
litigation
deprives
them
of
an
earlier
remedy.
alternatively,
quicker
resolution
through
arbitration
complements
congress'
goals.
it
doesn't
conflict
with
them.
if
reinstatement
is
found
to
be
an
appropriate
remedy
in
arbitration,
it
can
be
quicker,
cheaper,
and
certainly
less
adversarial
than
litigation.
isn't
that
better
for
everyone?
it's
much
easier
for
an
employer
to
reinstate
someone
within
a
matter
of
months
than
it
is
when
the
time,
litigation
cost,
and
yes,
even
the
emotional
involvement
of
litigation,
have
made
that
prohibitive.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
yes.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
would
be
reviewed
much
quicker,
because
it
would
be
resolved
more
quickly,
as
a
general
proposition.
and
i'm
focusing
now
on
the
time,
whatever
the
review
might
be
allowed.
whether
it's
affirmed
or
overturned
or
sent
back
for
a
reevaluation,
all
the
parties
are
better
off
to
have
that
resolved
sooner
than
it
is
now
in
litigation.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
was
really
comparing
that
with
the
litigation
itself.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
but
it's
not
a
de
novo
review.
it
would
be
a
far--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--a
more
limited
review,
as
authorized
and
only
as
authorized
by
section,
i
think
it's
10
and
11
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
and
the
deterrence
of
the
act,
another
goal
of
the
act,
another
goal
of
encouraging
people
to
file
charges,
would
also
be
enhanced
by
resolution
through
arbitration.
where
a
coworker
sees
that
another
co-worker
had
his
age
claim
rights
vindicated
through
arbitration
quickly,
or
certainly
more
quickly
than
might
be
available
in
litigation,
that
co-worker,
if
he
or
she
is
indeed
a
victim
of
age
discrimination,
is
going
to
be
more
likely
to
pursue
her
rights
under
the
statute.
this
is
particularly
important
where
you're
talking
about
victims
that
don't
have
the
economic
wherewithal
to
take
on
expensive
and
time
consuming
litigation.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
i
think...
i
would
assume
the
individual
would
understand
that
was
based
on
the
merits
and
the
resolution
of
that
particular
claim.
knowing
that
a
co-worker...
anyone
can
get
to
arbitration
quicker,
justice
blackmun,
is
my
point
there,
that
whatever
the
ultimate
resolution,
as
long
as
the
rights
can
be
vindicated,
as
this
court
has
said,
then
deterrence
is
also
being
fulfilled.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
these
rules
that
would
prohibit
them
from
doing
that
if
the
facts
in
a
particular
arbitration
were
to
justify
that.
there
has
been
a
recent
amendment
to
one
of
the
rules...
i'm
sorry
i
can't
quote
you
the
particular
rule...
which
does
allow
for
multiple
parties
to
participate
in
an
arbitration--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
very
similar
to
a
class
action.
in
an
age
case,
of
course
class
members
have
to
opt
in.
they
have
to
exercise
that
option
to
opt
in.
that
is
very
analogous
to
the,
to
this
new
york
exchange
rule
that
allows
multiple
parties
to
participate.
and
your
honor,
with
regard
to...
excuse
me,
mr....
justice
o'connor,
i
think
there...
i
know
there
are
no
restrictions
in
these
rules
on
the
power
to
remedy
that
the
arbitrator
has.
my
view
is
that
the
arbitrator
has
all
of
the
same
power
that
to
remedy
that
is
available
under
the
statute.
arbitration,
of
course,
finally,
also
helps
reduce
the
overburden
work
load
of
the
commission,
state,
and
local
agencies,
and
hopefully
the
federal
courts.
the
court
has
found
that
other
statutes
reflecting
equally
important
public
interest
to
be
entirely
appropriate
for
arbitration.
the
reasons
are
clear.
the
public
interest
in
those
statutes
were
not
diminished
by
arbitration.
the
liberal
policy
favored
in
arbitration
under
the
age
act...
i'm
sorry,
under
the
faa,
must
be
applied
absent
affirmative
congressional
intent
to
prohibit.
i
would
like
to
turn
next
to
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
petitioner
that
somehow
the
age
act
is
different.
the
plaintiff,
in
my
view,
attempts
to
create
a
conflict
between
the
purposes
of
the
age
act
and
the
purposes
of
the
line
of
cases
of...
the
faa
cases
of
this
court.
indeed,
he
seems
to
argue
that
unless
gardner-denver
is
allowed
to
control
the
circumstances
here,
then
gardner-denver
must
be
reversed.
well,
those
are
two
poles
apart,
and
there's
a
lot
of
ground
in
between.
our
position
is
very
clear.
there
is
no
need
to
even
consider
reversing
gardner-denver
or
any
progeny
of
that
decision.
the
factual
differences,
the
legal
issue
differences,
and
the
analysis
differences
under
the
different
lines
of
cases
are
so
stark
that
there's
no
conflict
at
all,
and
therefore
both
purposes,
both
statutes'
purposes
can
be
satisfied.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
at
bottom
it's
the
collective
bargaining
context
of
gardner-denver.
that
dominated
the
court's
consideration,
and
i
would
submit
the
ultimate
resolution
of
that
claim.
the
court
focus
in
that
case
upon...
which
by
the
way
was
an
already-completed
arbitration.
it
was
not
an
issue
of
enforcing
an
arbitration
agreement.
the
arbitration
had
already
been
done
under
a
union's
collective
bargaining
arbitration
mechanism.
and
the
court
said
in
gardner-denver
that
only
the
contractual
claim
had
been
resolved.
now,
here
comes
the
company
saying
well,
we
won
the
discrimination
issue
in
arbitration,
that
forecloses
the
statutory
claim.
that's
what
was
rejected,
because
what
you
had
there
was
a
conflict
between
two
public
policies,
one
encouraging
collective
bargaining,
and
the
salutary
benefits
of
collective
bargaining
including
resolution
of
claims
through
arbitration.
but
that
sort
of
arbitration
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
arbitration
under
the
new
york
exchange
rules.
mr.
gilmer
was
never
a
member
of
a
union.
he
remains
in
full
control
of
selecting
the
arbitrator,
deciding
what
evidence
to
submit.
there
is
no
one
between
him
and
the
resolution
of
his
claim.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
that's
what
i
meant
to
say,
justice
scalia,
is
that--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--no,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
arbitration
only
resolved
the
contractual
claim
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
and
the
company
apparently
was
trying
to
take
that
contract
resolution
and
saying
well,
then,
that
controls,
through
preclusion,
that
controls
the
results
under
the
statute.
and
that's
at
bottom
what
made
the
difference
in
that
case,
because
you...
the
court
was
clearly
concerned
about
the
fox
in
the
hen
house
problem.
because
clearly...
and
it
said
so
in
that
decision,
that
letting
the
two
entities
that
are
the...
i'm
not
talking
about
the
specific
ones
in
that
case,
but
the
employer
and
the
union,
both
of
which
have
been
accused,
not
in
that
case
but
in
other
cases,
of
discrimination.
and
the
act
was
passed
to
address
that
sort
of
stuff.
so
they
clearly...
the
court
clearly
did
not
feel
comfortable
with
the
union
being
in
charge
of
even
the
ultimate
decision
of
whether
it
went
to
arbitration.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
under
1983,
as
i
recall
the
facts
of
that
case.
and
it's
no
different
than
gardner-denver.
it
also
was
a
collective
bargaining--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--well,
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
arbitration
in
mcdonald
also,
an
already-completed
arbitration.
and
the
issue
there
was,
again,
preclusion,
whether
or
not
the
resolution
of
the
contract
issue
controlled
the
statutory
issue
under
1983.
so
the
case
as,
i
see
them
as
just
being
identical
to
one
another.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
recall.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
and
that
probably
controlled
whether
or
not
the
issue
even
went
to
arbitration.
that
is,
that
is
the
fundamental
difference,
and
that's
of
course
not
present
here.
there
is
no
conflict
like
that
here.
there
is
not
even
the
potential
for
the
conflict
here.
the...
in
closing,
i
want
to
point
out
certain
unique
facts
about
this
case
that
i
think
fully
support
the
compliance
with
the
faa's
mandate
for
arbitration
here.
the
facts
are
peculiarly
appropriate
for
arbitration.
mr.
gilmer
is
an
experienced
executive.
he's
not
a
worker
moving
goods
in
commerce.
for
20
years
he
has
been
registered
with
this
very
stock
exchange
that
he
registered
with
with
this
respondent.
he
has
worked
in
the
industry
for
the
28
years.
the
registration
agreement
is
a
customary
requirement
of
stock
brokers
buying
and
selling
securities
in
this
highly
regulated
industry.
indeed,
the
agreement
is
no
different
than
the
very
type
of
agreement
this
court
has
found
enforceable
against
customers,
far
less
sophisticated,
in
mcmahon
and
the
rodriguez
case.
this
arbitration
agreement
is
an
integral
part
of
the
exchange's
self-regulatory--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--if
they
are
under...
if
they
comply...
if
they
come
under
the
faa,
yes.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
yes.
it's
enforceable
particularly
in
light
of
the
faa--
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
--because
that
mandates
enforcement
of
that.
your
honor,
one
final
point
i
would
like
to
point
out.
in
their
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
age
act
is
so
paramount
or
so
important
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
differently,
and
i
assume
they
feel
the
same
way
about
title
vii,
in
our
view
that
was
rejected
in
mitsubishi.
that
argument
was
made
in
mitsubishi
that
the
importance
of
the
act
there
was
so
paramount
that,
that
the
court
should
not
allow
enforcement
under
the
faa.
in
that
decision
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
that
a
concern
for
statutorily
protected
classes
provides
no
reason
to
color
the
lens
through
which
the
arbitration
clause
is
read,
provides
no
reason.
you
don't
look
at
is
the
class
age
victims,
or
is
the
class
black
employees,
or
is
the
class
securities
customers.
that
has
been
rejected
in
mitsubishi.
indeed,
in
october
1989
this
court
rejected,
in
my
view,
a
very
analogous
case,
the
second
circuit
case
in
bird
v.
shearson
lehman.
it
vacated
and
remanded
that
in
light
of
the
rodriguez
decision.
while
i
certainly
don't
know
the
precise
reasons,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
strong
language
in
mcmahon,
rodriguez,
based
on
mitsubishi,
has
eliminated
this
sort
of
public
policy,
this
sort
of
value
judgment
that
somehow
this
statute
is
different,
or
this
statute
is
so
important
that
arbitration
just
should
not
be
allowed
to
touch
it.
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
vacation
and
remand
of
that
that
that
argument
is
long
gone.
that,
of
course,
is
what
this
court
said
was
the
primary
underpinning
of
the
wilko
v.
swan.
in
fact,
in
mitsubishi
the
court
also
rejected
the
second
circuit's
standard
known
as
the
american
safety
equipment
standard,
which
was,
again,
a
case
that
focused
on...
the
sherman
act
in
that
case
was
viewed
to
be
so
different
and
so
important
that
it
could
not
be
arbitrated.
in...
i
think
it
was
the
mcmahon
case
or
mitsubishi,
this
court
took
those
and
point
by
point
rejected
the
underpinnings.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
it
was
an
erisa
case,
your
honor.
it
involved
employment
benefits
under
erisa.
and
it...
the
second
circuit
bird
decision,
reading
that
is
exactly...
indeed
it
relies
upon
gardner-denver,
barrentine,
and
mcdonald,
the
same
way
the
plaintiff
does
here.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
your
honor,
maybe
more
often
because
of
new
york.
mr.
james
b.
spears,
jr.
not
out
of
new
york,
your
honor.
