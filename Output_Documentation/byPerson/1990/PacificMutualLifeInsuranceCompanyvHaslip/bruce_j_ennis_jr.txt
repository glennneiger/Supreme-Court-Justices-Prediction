mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
alabama
provides
two
levels
of
protection
for
defendants
facing
the
possibility
of
punitive
damages.
first,
the
jury
sets
the
award
pursuant
to
the
traditional
common
law
standards,
then,
trial
and
appellate
courts
independently
reassess
the
award
pursuant
to
even
more
protective
standards.
let
me
talk
first
about
the
jury
instructions.
the
jury
was
instructed,
with
respect
to
the
state's
purpose
in
punitive
damage
awards,
that
they
are
to
punish
and
deter,
that
they
are
not
to
compensate
the
plaintiff,
or
not
to
be
a
windfall
to
the
plaintiff,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
amount
of
the
award
must
be
tailored
to
the
character
and
the
degree
of
the
wrong
as
shown
by
the
evidence
in
that
particular
case.
pacific
mutual
did
not
object
to
those
common
law
instructions
at
the
trial,
and
did
not
request
any
more
specific
instructions
at
trial.
those
common
law
standards,
by
themselves,
certainly
satisfy
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice.
they
have
been
used
and
approved
by
courts
throughout
the
land
for
200
years,
and
no
court
has
ever
found
them
violative
of
due
process.
despite
enormous
pressure
on
state
legislatures
and
congress
in
the
past
15
years,
those
are
still
the
standards
that
are
used
in
nearly
every
state
today.
these
standards,
as
the
court
recognized
in
day
v.
woodworth,
were
well
established
before
the
due
process
clause
was
adopted.
in
fact,
in
another
alabama
case,
louis
pizitz,
decided
by
this
court
in
1927,
this
court
upheld
those
very
common
law
standards
and
unanimously
rejected
precisely
the
same
due
process
challenge
pacific
mutual
is
raising
again...
that
these
common
law
standards
gave
the
jury
"unbridled
discretion"
to
fix
the
punitive
amount
"without
any
method
of
ascertainment
and
without
any
limit
to
the
amount
it
may
impose.
"
that
argument
was
rejected
unanimously
in
pizitz.
earlier,
in
standard
oil
v.
missouri,
this
court
also
upheld
against
due
process
attack
a
punitive
fine
where
there
were
no
standards
for
determining
the
amount
and
no
maximum.
that
was
a
state
antitrust
fine,
but
the
court
relied
for
its
decision
expressly
on
the
analogy
to
punitive
damage
proceedings.
i
think
that
there
is
simply
no
anchor
in
the
text
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
there
is
certainly
no
established
societal
norm
from
which
the
court
could
define
or
develop
new
standards.
in
this
circumstance,
where
these
standards
have
been
used
and
thought
to
be
fair
for
over
200
years,
and
where,
even
today,
pacific
mutual
does
not
suggest
specific
standards
for
determining
what
is
the
right
amount,
merely
a
cap
on
whatever
amount
is
awarded--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--purely...
wholly
within
their
discretion?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
that...
that
would
be
more--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
even
such
minimal
instructions
as
that
would
satisfy
the
due
process
clause
as
that
clause
is
constructed.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
not,
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
court's
due
process
decisions
in
the
past
have
always
applied
with
respect
to
clarity
in
the
conduct
that
can
trigger
a
punishment
of
any
type.
there
must
be
clear
notice
of
the
conduct.
that
was
certainly
true
in
this
case.
pacific
mutual
was
punished
for
intentional
fraud.
there
is
no
claim
that
the
conduct
at
issue
in
this
case
was
vague.
second,
even
in
the
case
of
capital
punishment,
in
the
mcgautha
decision,
this
court
ruled
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
more
specific
standards
for
determining
the
sentence
of
death.
in
that
case,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
had
"absolute
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
sentence
to
death
or
not.
"
and
there
was
absolutely
no
legislative
or
judicial
guidance
as
to
whether
to
impose
that
penalty.
the
court
decided
that,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
that
did
not
violate
the
constitution.
the
next
year,
in
furman,
the
court,
of
course,
did
decide
under
the
higher,
more
rigorous
standards
of
the
eighth
amendment,
that
capital
cases
do
require
guided
discretion,
but
the
due
process
clause
does
not,
as
this
court
ruled
in
pizitz,
and
ruled
in
standard
oil
v.
missouri.
let
me
turn
to
the
second
level
of
protection
that
alabama
gives
defendants
in
punitive
damages
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
that
is
actually--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that
is
actually...
the
hypothetical
that
justice
o'connor
posed
is
actually
less
protective
of
defendants
than
the
traditional
common
law
standards.
the
traditional
common
law
standards
do
more
than
that.
they
say,
here's
the
purpose
of
punitive
damage
awards,
to
punish
and
deter,
and
they
say
that
you
must
base
your
amount
on
the
character
and
the
degree
of
wrongdoing
as
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
i
think
that
that
standard,
which
was
the
standard
before
the
court
in
pizitz
and
all
the
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
and
all
the
cases
that
have
been
upheld
over
the
200-year
history
in
which
that
standard
has
been
used,
do
find
that
that's--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
let
me
turn
to
the
next
level
of
protection.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
i
think
that
would
certainly
not
satisfy
due
process,
because
that
would
go
to
the
conduct
issue
that
punitive
damages--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
there
has
been--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
if
it
were,
then
that
would
be
a
different
question
entirely,
about
an
arbitrary
and
unequal
application
of
a
supposedly
neutral
principle
of
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
issue
from
the
issue
posed
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
it
could
be
shown
through
empirical
evidence
that
there
wasn't
just
an
occasional
aberrational
decision,
but
that,
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
it
was
entirely
arbitrary
and
fortuitous
whether
a
particular
defendant
got
hit
with
a
punitive
damage
award
or
not,
that
would
raise
a
due
process
question
with
respect
to
conduct
that
can
subject
one
to
a
punitive
damage
award.
but
that
is
not
this
case
at
all.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
let
me
say
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
of
this
case
or
this
court
to
have
lost
confidence
in
the
punitive
damage--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--in
alabama
today--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
there
is
a
due
process
component
that
requires
predictability
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
conduct
that
can
trigger
a
punitive
award.
pacific
mutual
has
not
cited
any
cases
which
take
the
very
big
next
step,
and
ruled
that
there
must
also
be
predictability
with
respect
to
the
precise
punishment
that
a
defendant
can
incur
when
they
violate
a
clear
conduct
norm.
and
there
is
no
case
in
the
history
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
that
i
am
aware
of,
that
takes
that
step.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
am
talking
right
now
with
respect
to
civil
cases.
this
is
not,
obviously,
a
criminal
case
where
the
ex
post
facto
case...
ex
post
factor
clause
would
apply.
the
ex
post
facto
clause
also,
i
think,
is
different
because
it
requires...
it
applies
to
conduct
that
was
not
criminal
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
i
understand
your
question,
but--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
true.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
whether
a
defendant
would
be
subjected
to
any
punitive
damage
award
at
all,
if
it
was
just
fortuitous--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--whether
every
fourth
defendant
gets
punitive
awards
against
them--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that
would
go
to
the
conduct
that
would
trigger
a
punitive
award,
and
i
think
that
would
implicate
a
due
process
concern.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
the
same
would
not
be--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
that
it's
not
a
requirement
that
jury
verdicts
be
predictable.
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
this
court's
decisions
have
never
required
that
due
process
requires
predictability
of
the
amount
of
a
particular
punishment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they
just
have
to
have
some
rational
basis,
and
not
be
arbitrary,
that's
correct.
and
alabama
today
ensures
that
it
is
not
an
arbitrary
process.
the
hammond
hornsby
standard
of
review
which
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
been
adopting
since
1986,
expressly
provides
that
jury
verdicts
will
be
independently
reassessed
by
trial
and
appellate
courts
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
amount
set
by
the
jury
is
more
than
would
be
necessary
to
accomplish
society's
goals
of
punishment
and
deterrence.
that
test
has
actually
been
advocated
by
the
insurance
industry
amicus
brief
supporting
pacific
mutual
as
a
workable
and
appropriate
test
that
will
protect
against
arbitrary
and
irrational
punitive
awards.
that's
the
test
that
alabama
applies
today.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
the
trial
judge's
memorandum
does
refer
to
the
hammond
opinion
and
does
state
that
the
award
was
reviewed
by
the
trial
court
under
hammond.
the
important
thing
to
understand
that
it
is
not
just
the
trial
court
but
the
alabama
supreme
court
itself
that
independently
applies
these
factors.
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
itself
reduced
or
set
aside
many
punitive
damage
awards,
even
when
the
trial
court
thought
they
were
appropriate.
for
example,
one
of
the
hammond-type
reviews
requires
a
comparability
review
to
ensure
fairness
of
punitive
amounts
across
a
range
of
similar
cases.
using
that
comparability
review,
which
is
not
equally
available
to
the
trial
courts
because
they
are
not
as
aware
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
of
the
range
of
cases,
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
regularly
reduced
punitive
damage
awards
when
it
finds
that
the
amount
is
outside
that
reasonable
range.
just
within
the
past
10
days,
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
done
that
twice.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
white--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
white
i
think
there
is
no
due
process
problem
at
all
simply
with
the
common
law
standards
and
standards
for
review,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
that
do
impose
an
outer
limit
regardless
of
the
fairness
of
the
standard
of
procedure.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
outer
limit
would
be,
under
the
substantive
component
of
the
due
process
clause--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that
the
punitive
award
not
exceed
an
amount
that
would
rationally
further
the
state's
legitimate
objectives.
now,
in
this
case,
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
serious
argument
that
this
award
violates
that
standard,
for
the
simple
reason--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
apply
to
whether...
to
predictability
of
the
amount
of
the
punitive
damage
award.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
is,
perhaps,
a
substantive
component
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
cases
that
established
such
a
substantive
limit
on
what
is
state
economic
regulation
are
very
old
cases
and
may
not
be
good
law
today,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case.
i'm
not
challenging
those
old
cases
in
which
the
court
did
say
that
a
civil
fine
or
civil
penalty
which
is
wholly
arbitrary
and
irrational
may
violate
the
substantive
component
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
the
past...
since
1986,
a
majority
of
the
states
have
actually
legislatively
revisited
their
punitive
damages
systems,
but
only
nine
states
today
impose
caps
on
the
upper
limit
of
punitive
awards.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we
have
cited
in
our...
actually
in
our
opposition
to
certiorari...
the
four
states
that
have
legislatively
established
some
standards.
those
standards
are
remarkably
identical
to
the
standards
that
alabama
applies
as
a
matter
of
common
law.
they
are
remarkably
similar
to
the
hammond
hornsby
standards
of
review.
so
far
as
i'm
aware--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does.
in
this
case,
let
me
make
very
clear
that
the
standard
of
review
that
was
used
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
much
more
protective
than
the
traditional,
common
law
standard
of
review
that
was
at
issue
in
browning-ferris
and
bankers
life.
there,
the
courts
applied
the
traditional
standard
of
whether
the
verdict
was
the
result
of
bias,
passion,
prejudice,
or
corruption.
here,
the
alabama
supreme
court
applies
a
much
more
protective
standard,
and
it
will
explicitly
reduce
or
set
aside
a
punitive
award
even
if
that
award
was
not
the
result
of
bias,
passion,
or
prejudice,
if
the
award
is
greater
than
is
reasonably
necessary
to
accomplish
society's
objectives
of
punishment
and
deterrence,
and
it
measures
whether
the
award
exceeds
that
test
by
an
application
of
the
seven
standards
in
the
hammond
hornsby
standard
of
review.
in
15
cases
since
1986,
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
reduced
or
set
aside
jury
awards
under
that
standard.
this
is
a
standard
with
teeth.
it
is
a
meaningful,
meaningful
constraint
on--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
total,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
at
least
15,
and
i
would
be
happy
in
a
post-trial
submission
to
try
to
get
that
information
to
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
are
at
least
two
parts
of
an
answer
to
that
question.
the
first
is,
you
can't
determine
how
much
is
appropriate
to
deter
based
simply
on
knowledge
of
the
wealth
of
a
defendant.
the
jury
is
instructed
they
must
look
at
character
and
the
degree
of
the
wrongdoing.
under
the
hammond
standards,
the
reviewing
courts
are
instructed
to
look
at
how
much
knowledge
the
defendant
had.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right.
the
character
and
the
degree
of
the
wrongdoing.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it's
a
societal
judgment.
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
it's...
it's
very
much
the
process
that
judges
go
through
and
juries
go
through
every
day
in
deciding
difficult
questions
that
are--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
alabama
supreme
court
looks
at
those
factors.
for
example,
whether
the
defendant
had
continuing
notice
of
the
particular
wrongdoing
at
issue,
whether
it
took
corrective
steps
or
not.
there
very
specific
standards,
cited
at
page
32,
33
of
our
brief,
which
the
courts
use
to
reach
that
decision.
in
a
recent
case,
for
example,
the
alabama
supreme
court
noted
that
the
degree
of
the
wrongdoing
was
sufficient
to
merit
a
punitive
award
by
itself,
but
noted,
as
the
jury
does
not
know,
that
that
same
defendant
had
been
hit
with
a
punitive
award
in
another
case,
and
therefore
decided
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
a
second
punitive
award
against
the
defendant
for
the
same
conduct.
that
would
not
rationally
further
the
state's
objectives,
and
so
it
set
aside
the
punitive
award
entirely,
based
upon
that
factor.
the
alabama
supreme
court
does
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
comparability
reviews.
it
says
to
itself,
all
right,
here's
another
insurance
bad
faith
case
and
a
punitive
award
was
set
at
this
amount;
we
have
had
seven
of
these
insurance
bad
faith
cases
in
the
past
3
years,
and
here
is
what
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
range
of
punishment
in
these
cases;
we
think
this
one
exceeds
that
reasonable
range,
and
reduces
it
accordingly.
it
is
not
a
standard
of
review
that
simply
rubber-stamps
the
jury.
far
from
it.
in
alabama,
i
think,
unlike
any
other
state
of
which
i'm
aware,
there
is
a
right
for
a
post-verdict
evidentiary
hearing
at
which
the
defendant
can
present
new
evidence
that
was
never
presented
to
the
jury
in...
in
support
of
reducing
the
punitive
award.
the
defendant
can
come
in
and
say,
the
award
should
be
reduced
because
i
am
quite
poor,
and
this
would
absolutely
bankrupt
me
and
cripple
me.
the
defendant
can
come
in
and
say,
the
award
should
be
reduced
because
i
have
already
been
subjected
to
a
criminal
fine
for
similar
conduct.
that
kind
of
information
would
be
extremely
prejudicial
to
a
jury...
for
a
jury
to
hear
at
the
liability
phase.
but
alabama
courts
give
the
defendant
an
evidentiary
opportunity
to
present
all
relevant
evidence,
and
then,
based
on
that
evidence,
the
courts
independently
reassess.
they
are
not
simply
rubber-stamping
jury
verdicts.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that...
whether
to
award
punitive
damages
is
discretionary
with
the
jury,
because
it
is
supposed
to
reflect
a
societal
judgment
about
whether
this
conduct
is
deserving
of
punishment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct.
let
me
just
say--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
that's
not
quite
as
simple
as
that,
justice
white.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
standard
is
that
before
a
jury
can
even
consider
whether
it
wants
to
impose
a
punitive
amount,
it
must
find
that
the
conduct
violates
the
conduct
standard
requisite
for
a
punitive
award.
in
this
case,
the
conduct
standard
was
intentional
fraud.
you
can't
simply--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--impose
punitive
damages
because
you
think
somebody
was
a
little
negligent,
or
a
little
sloppy,
in
alabama.
there
must
be
some
element
of
intentional
wrongdoing.
once
that
threshold
has
been
crossed,
however,
it
is
discretionary.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not
in
alabama,
your
honor.
some
states
do
authorize
punitive
damages
for
reckless
conduct,
for
gross
recklessness.
this
court
in
smith
v.
wade
adopted
that
as
the
appropriate
standard
for
actions
under
1983,
without
requiring--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--private
liability
cases,
your
honor.
but
in
alabama--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--product
liability
cases?
in
alabama,
there
has
to
be
an
intentional
wrongdoing
element.
i'm
sure
some
other
states
have
somewhat
lesser
degrees
of
a
mental
wrongdoing
component,
but
almost
everybody--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
that's
not
enough.
it's
not
just
putting
the
product
into
commerce
that's
enough.
there
has
to
be
an
element
of
wrongdoing,
a
mental
element
of
intent
to
commit
wrong.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me...
let
me
turn
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
pacific
mutual's
argument
on
vicarious
liability
is
that
there
must...
constitutionally,
there
must
be
some
element
of
benefit
to
the
principal.
first,
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
because
at
the
trial
level
and
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
level,
pacific
mutual
never
argued
that
benefit
is
a
constitutional
requirement
for
vicarious
liability.
it's
argument
was
on
quite
different
grounds.
furthermore,
this
would
be
a
very
inappropriate
case
to
consider
that,
because
indisputably
in
this
case,
there
was
economic
benefit
to
pacific
mutual.
there
were
at
least
3
months
of
premiums
on
life
insurance
policies
that
pacific
mutual
received
and
never
refunded
as
a
result
of
these
frauds.
but
turning
to
the
merits
of
that
vicarious
liability
argument,
in
both
punitive
damages
cases
and
antitrust
cases
and
even
in
criminal
cases,
this
court
has
expressly
approved
vicarious
liability
without
either
fault
by
the
principal
or
benefit
to
the
principal.
again,
in
the
pizitz
case,
decided
unanimously
in
1927,
the
court
squarely
ruled
that
alabama,
the
same
system
we're
talking
about
here,
could
impose
vicarious
liability
for
punitive
damages
without
fault
by
the
principal.
that
was
a
unanimous
ruling
of
this
court.
in
the
hydro-level
case,
this
court
even
went
so
far
as
to
adopt
as
rational
and
wise
social
policy
a
rule
of
vicarious
liability
for
federal
antitrust
cases
that
is
indistinguishable
from
the
alabama
rule
at
issue
here.
in
hydro-level,
this
court
ruled
that,
under
the
antitrust
laws,
a
principal
can
be
held
vicariously
liable
for
antitrust
violations
by
an
agent
even
if
the
principal
was
not
at
all
at
fault,
and
even
if
the
principal
did
not
benefit.
now,
i
know
that
some
justices
of
this
court
dissented
from
hydro-level
and
did
not
think
that
was
the
wisest
or
most
rational...
the
best
policy
choice,
but
the
fact
that
the
court
as
a
court
reached
that
conclusion
shows
that
that
decision
is
at
least
a
rational
judgment.
alabama
has
made
that
rational
judgment,
and
it
should
be
upheld.
finally,
even
in
criminal
cases--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
you
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
you
don't,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
this
is
not
a
policy
case.
this
is
a
constitutional
case
before
the
court,
and
you
certainly
don't
have
to
as
a
policy
matter.
even
in
criminal
cases,
this
court
has
upheld
vicarious
criminal
liability
without
fault
or
benefit.
in
the
park
and
daughterwite
cases,
the
court
even
went
so
far
as
to
rule
that
an
individual
officer
of
a
company
can
be
held
criminally
liable
on
vicarious
liability
principles
for
the
wrongdoing
of
an
agent
of
which
the
principal
was
not
aware,
and
from
which
the
principal
did
not
benefit.
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
a
fortiori
that
if
vicarious
liability
is
appropriate
even
in
that
criminal
context,
it
is
appropriate
here.
let
me
simply
conclude,
since
my
time
is
almost
to
expire,
by
saying
that
the
principal
issue
here
i
think
is
the
standards
issue.
i
think
that
alabama
has
developed
a
rational
system
for
achieving
legitimate
and
very
important
state
objectives.
alabama
provides
substantially
more
protection
than
the
common
law
standards
that
were
well
established
when
the
due
process
clause
was
adopted
and
that
are
still
the
prevailing
standards
today.
this
court
should
not
expand
upon
that
traditional
understanding
of
due
process
and
throw
settled
state
tort
law
into
complete
disarray
without
compelling
evidence
that
the
punitive
damage
awards
are
fundamentally
unfair
in
the
majority
of
cases,
and
without
compelling
reason
to
believe
that
the
legislative
process
is
closed
or
is
incapable
of
addressing
that
problem.
there
does
not
have
to
be
a
constitutional
remedy
for
every
social
problem.
in
this
case,
i
think
this
is
a
paradigmatic
case
for
judicial
restraint,
not
judicial
activism.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
mr.
beckman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
