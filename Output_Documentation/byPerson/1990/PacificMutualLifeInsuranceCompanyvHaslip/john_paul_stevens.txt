justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
we
should
sort
of
treat
the
case
as
though
the
actual
damage...
i
guess
there
were
some
actual
pecuniary
damages,
a
few
thousand
dollars,
too,
weren't
there?
maybe
there
was
about
210
of
actual
damages,
and
840
of
the
other,
so
it's
4...
4
to
1
ratio?
justice
stevens
right,
but
as
to
this
particular
respondent,
it's
roughly...
we
can
treat
the
case
as
though
the
punitive
damage
was
roughly
four
times
the
actual
damage?
justice
stevens
i
guess
that
argument...
well,
supposing
you
have
a
corporation,
and
the
president
of
the
corporation
does
a
lot
of
things
secretly.
the
directors
don't
know,
the
stockholders
don't
know,
and
you
impose
a
criminal
fine
for
violating
the
sherman
act
or
something.
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
maybe
they...
maybe
they
fixed
prices
at
a
level
that
caused
them
to
lose
money.
that
wouldn't
be
a
defense,
would
it?
justice
stevens
but
wouldn't
that
also...
that
argument
also
justify
saying
you
can't
recover
civil...
even
actual
damages?
justice
stevens
mr.
beckman,
can
i
ask
kind
of
a
long-run,
long-range
question?
are
you
claiming
in
this
case
that
the
alabama
procedure
is
kind
of
invalid
on
its
face,
and
therefore,
regardless
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
every
punitive
damage
award
in
alabama
should
be
set
aside,
or
do
you
depend
on
the
facts
of
your
case?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
then
the
other
thing
that's
running
through
my
mind,
to
the
extent
that
you've
suggested
that
maybe
we
could
craft
rules
like
a
ceiling
and
special
procedures
and
all,
are
you
suggesting
that
those
procedures...
that
we
would
write
a
rule
for
the
future
that
would
not
be
retroactive
to
past
awards,
or...
you
don't
have
a
retroactivity
problem?
justice
stevens
but
until
they
meet
the
minimum
that
you
think
are
required,
all
these
awards
would
be
invalid?
