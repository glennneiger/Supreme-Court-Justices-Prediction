justice
white
what
about
ex
post
facto
cases?
justice
white
the
argument
is
that
punitive
damages
don't
need
all
these
protections,
these
specific
factors
that
alabama
supreme
court
has
imposed,
and
that
there
doesn't
need
to
be
appellate
review.
justice
white
there's
just
no
due
process
problem
at
all.
justice
white
well,
what
is...
is
there...
is
there
some
due
process
requirement
that
the
punitive
damages
not
be
excessive?
justice
white
what,
there's
not
a
limit
like,
excessive?
justice
white
yes?
justice
white
and
you
say
this
excessiveness
comes
out
of
the
due
process
clause,
this...
you
say?
how
does
it
do
that?
you
say
that...
i
thought
you
started
out
saying
the
due
process
clause
just
doesn't
read
on
punitive
damages?
justice
white
but
it
does
apply,
you
say...
it
can
be
too
great?
justice
white
well,
you
said
there
was
awhile
ago.
justice
white
do
you
know
of
any
states
around
that
not
only
agree
with
that
notion
but
have
set
down
some
more
specific
standards
than
just
excessiveness
or
irrationality?
justice
white
have
they
put
down
some
overall
limits,
or
some
proportionality
rules?
justice
white
well,
what
about...
nine
states
put
caps
on,
but
how
about
others
that
have
set
some
standards,
other
than
just
these
vague...
rather
vague
standards?
justice
white
you
don't
think...
i
gather
you
don't
think
the
due
process
clause
need
go
any
farther
than
just
to
say
to
a
jury
or
to
an
appellate
court,
the
award
should
not
be
excessive?
do
you
think
that
requires
any
more
specific
guide...
guidelines
than
that?
justice
white
is
it...
is
it
anticipated
that
juries
given
this
kind
of
an
instruction
will
often
refuse
to
give
any
punitive
damages?
justice
white
some...
deserving
of
imposing
something
on
the
defendant
other
than
compensatory--
justice
white
--damages?
justice
white
is
that...
that's
just
the
standard
the
jury
has?
if
you
think
this
fellow
really
deserves
it,
give
it...
let
him
have
it,
eh?
justice
white
well,
the
degree
of
the
crime?
how
much
you
hate
it?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
you
don't
think...
you
don't...
you
don't
think
you
can
be
just
so
negligent
that
punitive
damages
are
authorized
in
alabama?
justice
white
product
liability
cases?
justice
white
product.
product
liability.
justice
white
well,
everybody
intends
to
put
out
the
product.
is
that
just
enough?
justice
white
and
are
juries
told
that?
