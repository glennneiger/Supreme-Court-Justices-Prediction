justice
kennedy
assume
that
we're
just
talking
about
punishing
the
agent
himself.
forget
the
respondeat
superior
problem.
are
there
any
standards
that
you
could
cite
to
the
court
that
would
suffice
for
giving
punitive
damages
against
the
agent
himself
here?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
you
have
no
problem
with
the
theory
of
punitive
damages,
then.
it's
just
the
standard.
suppose
you
had
a
manufacturer
of
children's
play
equipment.
manufacturer
a
uses
a
rope
because
he
thinks
its
safe.
manufacturer
b
uses
the
same
rope
because
it's
much
cheaper,
and
he
knows
it's
very
unsafe.
two
children
are
injured.
the
injuries
are
exactly
the
same.
should
the
recovery
be
the
same
in
each
case?
justice
kennedy
so
you
have...
you
have
no
trouble
with
the
proposition
that,
in
the
second
case,
where
there
was
an
intentionally
substitution
of
an
inferior
fabric,
or
piece
of
equipment,
you
have
no
trouble
at
all
with
that
child
recovering
substantially
more,
even
though
his
injuries
were
the
same?
justice
kennedy
and
you
have
no
quarrel
with
that
element
in
the
law?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
before
you
get
there,
suppose
the
rule
in
the
state
were
that
one
out
of
every
four
defendants
is
subject
to
a
punitive
damage
award,
and
it
just
rotates
based
on
the
docket
number?
justice
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
it
were
shown
that,
in
effect,
that's
what's
happening
in
our
legal
system?
justice
kennedy
but
suppose
it
were?
justice
kennedy
so
if...
if...
if...
it
could
be
established
that,
in
a
particular
state,
and
there
was
simply
no
rhyme
or
reason
at
all
to
the
award
of
punitive
damages,
you
would
then
think
it
would
be
a
due
process
problem?
justice
kennedy
would
there
be
a
due
process
problem?
justice
kennedy
wouldn't
it
raise
due
process
standards
because
we've
lost
confidence
in
the
operation
of
the
system
to
operate
with
predictability,
with
fairness--
justice
kennedy
--no,
but
i'm
talking
about
what
the
standards
of
due
process
are,
and
you
seem
to
indicate
that
predictability,
evenness,
fairness,
proportionality--
justice
kennedy
--are
all
some
indices
of
due
process,
and
you
indicate
at
the
outset
you
don't
think
there's
any
due
process
standard,
i
had
thought,
with
reference
to
the
jury.
now,
i
know
you're
going
to
rush
to
the
second
point,
but
let's
just
talk
about
the
jury
instruction.
isn't
there...
isn't
there
some
due
process
component
that
requires
predictability?
