mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
that
judgment
affirmed
and
awarded
punitive
damages
against
the
petitioner,
pacific
mutual
life
insurance
company,
on
a
respondeat
superior
basis
for
fraud
committed
by
a
sales
agent
in
collecting
and
pocketing
premiums
from
a
policy
of
group
health
insurance
issued
by
another
carrier,
union
fidelity
life
insurance
company,
and
also
on
individual
policies
of
life
insurance
issued
by
pacific
mutual.
the
insurance
was
issued
to
cover
employees
of
the
city
of
roosevelt,
which
is
a
small
town
in
alabama.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
all
counts
asserted
by
plaintiffs
alleging
any
wrongdoing
against
pacific
mutual
directly
were
dismissed
and
abandoned,
so
that
the
sole
basis
of
the
award
was
respondeat
superior,
or
the
fraud
of
the
agent.
the
major
portion
of
the
award
went
to
mrs.
haslip
because
she
incurred
medical
expenses
during
a
period
which
would
have
been
covered
by
the
union
fidelity
policy
had
the
agent
not
misappropriated
the
premiums.
she
was
apparently
unable
to
pay
the
hospital
expenses,
and
a
judgment
was
entered
against
her.
and
that
appears
to
explain
the
great
disparity
in
the
award
that
went
to
her,
and
the
relatively
nominal
awards
that
went
to
the
other
plaintiffs.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
justice
o'connor,
under
alabama
law,
the
punitive
damage
award
to
mrs.
haslip
would
have
been
at
least
$840,000,
because
the
maximum...
she
had
a
prayer
for
$3
million
of
punitive
damages,
and
a
prayer
for
her
actual
damages,
plus
emotional
distress
damages
of
$200,000.
the
award
to
her
was
$1,040,000,
so
that
if
we
assumed
that
she
got
the
full
general,
actual,
economic
damages,
and
emotional
distress
damages,
for
which
she
prayed,
the
punitive
award
still
would
have
been
at
least
$840,000,
and
that
would
have
been
the
computation
under
alabama
law.
the
plaintiffs
themselves
submitted
the
case
to
the
alabama
supreme
court--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--yes,
and
under
the
cases
that
were
cited,
in
fact
by
the
respondents
here,
that
would
be
the
computation
of
the
award.
it
would
be
at
least
$840,000,
because
the
actual
other
damages
would
not
exceed
$200,000.
and
as
i
said,
the
plaintiffs
here
submitted--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--it
is
my
understanding
that
there
are,
justice
scalia.
i
cannot
cite
them
to
you
at
this
point.
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
that
could
happen,
but
they
would
then
have
been
limited
to
the
prayer
under
alabama
law.
and
again--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--i
will
do
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
case
cited
by
the
respondents
in
the
respondents
brief,
which
laid
out
their
position
that
the
award
would
have
been
$840,000
and
not
more,
because
as
i
stated,
the
respondents...
the
plaintiffs
presented
this
court
case
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
as
an
award
of
$1,040,000.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
all
of
the...
all
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
had
a
total
of
economic
damages
something
of
about
$3,900,
and
the
total
award
was
something
in
the
area
of
$1,077,000.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
yes,
justice
stevens.
pacific
mutual
has
petitioned
this
court
to
vacate
a
judgment
of
the
alabama
court
and
the
award
of
punitive
damages
as
violating
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
of
the
issues
that
were
briefed
and
submitted
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
would
like
to
focus
my
argument
on
three
central
issues:
first,
that
the
open-ended,
standardless
discretion
delegated
by
alabama
law
to
the
jury
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
punish
pacific
mutual
for
the
agent's
fraud,
and
if
so,
how
much,
violated
due
process.
second,
that
the
system
of
judicial
review
in
place
in
alabama
did
not
cure
those
violations,
and
third,
that
respondeat
superior
on
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
a
constitutionally
permissible
basis
for
imposing
punishment
on
pacific
mutual.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
just
the
punitive
award.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
petitioner
submits
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the...
in...
for
compensatory
damages
under
respondeat
superior,
the
rationale
of
it
is
that
where
one
of
two
innocent
people
should
suffer
because
of
acts
of
an
agent,
wrongful
acts
of
an
agent,
the
principal
who
put
the
agent
in
a
position
to
cause
the
injury
should
bear
the
loss.
imposing
punishment
on
a
principal
who,
as
in
this
case,
was
in
fact
a
victim
of,
in
effect,
embezzlement...
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
punishment.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
there's...
there
is...
that
is
a
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
under
the
sherman
act,
for
example,
or
a
regulatory
program,
the
company
is
under
a
direct
obligation
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
if
in
fact
fines
or
triple
damages
under
the
sherman
act
are
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
it
because
of
the
violation
by
the
company,
and
the
company
comes
in
and
tries
to
defend
saying
well,
high-level
management
or
the
responsible
people
didn't
authorize
those
acts
or
know
that
they
were
going
on.
and
the
courts
have
held
that
if
that
action
is
taken
in
the
course
of
the
company's
business,
and
to
further
its
profits,
the
company
management
can't
come
in
and
say
well,
we
didn't
know
what
was
going
on,
and
avoid
liability.
but
the
situation
is
different,
i
submit,
where
the
agent,
even
a
high-level
officer,
is
affirmatively
acting
against
the
company's
interest,
and
is
in
fact,
as
here,
embezzling,
or
stealing
the
money--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--but
they
were
still
acting
to
benefit
the
corporation
and
seeking
to
increase
its
profits
by
violating
the
law.
i
mean,
here,
there
was
no
possible
way
that
pacific
mutual
could
have
benefited
from
the
agent's
thefts
of
the
premiums,
and
those
thefts
that
were
actually
premiums
of
a...
due
to
another
company,
but
both
of
those
companies
had
liability
imposed
on
them,
under
alabama
law,
for
their
policies.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
but
there
you
have,
again,
an
innocent
third
party
and
the
innocent
company,
and
the
company
put
the
agent
in
a
position
to
cause
the
harm.
so
for
compensatory
damages,
vicarious
liability
has
some
purpose.
but
to
impose
punishment
on
a
company
that
has
had
a
theft
or
an
embezzlement
from
it
doesn't
forward
any
rational
goal
of
retribution
or
deterrence.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
only
the...
the
authority
that
we
have
cited
in
the
briefing
that
has
been
submitted.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
that
is
a
somewhat
different
case
than
those
that
we
have
been
relying
on,
such
as
the
standard
oil
of
texas
v.
the
united
states
case,
where
you
had
the
three
employees
stealing
oil
from
standard
and
then
selling
it
back.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
yes,
and...
and
if
you're--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--if
you
are
suggesting
that--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--i
would
suggest
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
that
would
be
because
if
you
had,
in
effect,
a
disloyal
employee
trying
to
sabotage
the
company
by
putting
in
procedures
which
would
in
fact
be
causing
emissions
beyond
epa
standards,
for
example,
it
would
really
not
forward
the
goals
of
retribution
and
deterrence
to
punish
the
company
because
it
had
that
employee
doing
that.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
that
would
be
direct
liability,
not
respondeat
superior
liability,
if
you're
suggesting
that
the
basis
of
the
punishment
then
would
be
that
the
company
had
not
controlled
or
was...
this
agent,
or
had
not
properly
monitored
them.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
i
would
indeed,
your
honor...
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
and
with
respect
to
pacific
mutual's
basic
due
process
point
presented
here,
alabama
law
delegated
complete
discretion
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
punish
pacific
mutual
for
the
agent's
fraud,
and
if
so,
how
much.
the
alabama
legislature
had
never
established
any
limits
on
permissible
punishment
for
conduct,
or
for
punitive
damages
generally,
and
the
decisions
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
recognized
that
in
alabama
there
was
no
legal
measure
which
limited
these
awards.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
yes.
one...
well,
two
come
to
mind,
and
one
that
would
not
work.
if
you're
talking
about
overall
standards
for
limiting
punitive
damages
awards,
which
i
understand
to
be
your
question,
it
would...
it...
i'm
sure
there
is
a
continuum
of
solutions
which
would
be
acceptable
and
meet
due
process
requirements.
but
one
which
certainly
would
be
for
the
legislature
to
take
various
categories
of
conduct
which
are
subject
to
this
umbrella
penalty,
which
is
a
whole
spectrum
of
torts
and
tortious
breach
of
contract
in
alabama,
and
define
the
categories
of
conduct
and
specify
the
penalties
for
those...
those
specified
items
of
conduct,
much
as
in
a
penal
code.
the
other
could
be,
and
still
meet,
i
think,
the
concerns
which
have
been
expressed
by
some
members
of
this
court
and...
with
respect
to
punitive
damages,
and
have...
try
to
have
an
umbrella
remedy,
a
situation
where
you
had
either
a
fraction
or
a
multiple
of
actual
economic
harm
caused,
which
would
cause
the
award
to
have
some
reasonable
relationship
to...
or
a
necessary
relationship
to
actual
harm,
plus
attorney's
fees,
to
take
care
of
small
cases
which
might
not
otherwise
be
brought.
and
i
would
suggest
also
a
cap,
and
then
the...
even
the
amount
of
a
multiple
of
actual
damages,
to
take
care
of
the
cases
such
as
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
accounting
firms,
where
there
would
be
a
large
corporation
where
a
lot
of
money
was
involved
but
a
very
small
degree
of
fault.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
no,
justice
o'connor,
it
would
not.
those
factors
are
highly
judgmental,
subjective,
and
would
not
remove
from
the
jury
the
personal
discretion
to
impose
punishment
on
a...
virtually
a
limitless
amount.
the
hammond
and
green
oil
factors
would
not
cure
the
lack
of
an
upper
limit
limiting
the
amount
of
the
award.
it
would
not--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--not
necessarily
a
dollar
limit,
if
a
multiple
plus
a
cap
approach
were
taken,
as
i
suggested
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
but...
but--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--yes,
justice...
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
yes.
the...
yes,
the
hammond
factors,
there's
really
only
three
of
them
that
are
at
all
substantive.
the
first
is
that
the
award
should
bear
some
reasonable
relationship
to
actual
damages.
but
in
practice,
that
has
proven
to
be
a
meaningless
test,
because
any...
any
relationship
can
be
and
has
been
held
to
be
reasonable.
and
further,
in
alabama,
at
least,
about
the
same
time
the
hammond
case
was
decided,
the
alabama
supreme
court
overruled
an
earlier
decision
which
had
required
a...
a...
required
relationship
between
actuals
and
punitives
and
adopted
a
rule
that
there
was
no
necessary
relationship
between
actuals
and
punitives.
and
the
second
hammond
factor
is
to
consider
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct.
that
is
really
only
putting
the...
in
different
words
what
the
jury
here
was
instructed
to
consider,
which
was
character
and
degree
of
the
wrong,
and
it
is
just
as
vague.
and
in
fact
this
court
noted
that
reprehensibility
was
not
a
suitable,
or
a
sufficiently
precise
basis
for
imposing
punishment
in
the
giaccio
v.
pennsylvania
case.
the
third,
relatively
substantive,
hammond
factor
was
the
wealth
of
the
defendant.
the
wealth
of
the
defendant
factor,
when
you
take
that
into
account,
really
only
ensures
that
a
large
corporation,
with
a
jury
argument
that
the
award
has
to
be
enough
to
hurt
and
sting,
is
going
to
ensure
that
there
is
in
effect
a
multimillion
dollar
award,
even
if
there
is
a
very
small
degree
of
fault,
and...
i
submit
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
that
those
factors
just
would
not
adequately
control
the
jury's
discretion.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
i
think
i--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--yes,
i
think
i
understand
your
question,
and
that
is
that
you
have
a
penal
code
section
which
specifies
in
advance,
and
says
that
the
maximum
penalty
for
that
specified
offense
is
up
to...
in
a
sense,
a...
action.
we
will
take...
confiscate
the
charter
of
the
corporation
and
all
of
its
assets.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
yes,
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
meet
due
process,
but
that
is
different
than
punitive
damages
situation,
because
there
the
legislature
has
acted
to
tailor
a
remedy
to
a
defined
offense.
but
with
punitive
damages,
you
have
this
whole
spectrum
of
torts
and
tortious
breach
of
contract,
and
with
an
umbrella
that...
that
fits
it
all.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
i'd
suggest
that
that--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--that
would
be
as
if...
and
the
situation
really
is
as
if,
for
example,
the
alabama
penal
code,
which
would
cover
everything
from
minor
traffic
offenses
to
first
degree
murder,
had
a
single
penalty
section
which
said,
for
any
violation
of
this
code
the
maximum
penalty
is
capital
punishment.
and
i
suggest
that
that
would
not
be
a
rational
and
meaningful
limit--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--or
even
notice--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--up
to
life
imprisonment--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--and
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
not
be
a
meaningful
or
realistic
penalty
for
99.9
percent
of
the
offenses
in
the
code;
similarly,
that
confiscation
of
all
the
assets
would
not
be
a
meaningful
or
really
reasonable
penalty
for
99.9
percent
of
the
offenses
in
punitive
damages.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
because
it
is
so
high
that
it
wouldn't
be
fair
notice
of
what
the
actual
penalties
would
be.
i
mean,
it's
like
having
life
imprisonment
for
a
traffic
offense.
it
wouldn't
take
the
discretion
away
from
the
sentencing
authority
to
give
virtually
any
sentence
for
a
minor
offense,
and
there
would
be
no
real
notice
to
anyone
of
what
the
penalty
might
be,
and
it
would
certainly
not
cure
the
open-ended
discretion
of
the
sentencer
in
that
situation.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
i
suggest
that
in
any
case
in
which
the
jury
was
instructed
as
it
was
in
this
case--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--that
due
process
requirements
would
not
be
met,
and
to
that
extent,
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
i
would
suggest
there
would
be
no
retroactivity
problem
and
even
that
this
court
would
not
have
to
craft
rules.
i
mean,
state
legislatures
can...
are
certainly
free
to
experiment
with
any
number
of
possible
solutions
to--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--yes,
justice
stevens,
but
that
is
our
position.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
i
would
suggest
not,
justice
kennedy,
if
in
fact
guilt
is
personal
and...
and
if
penalties
are
to
be
imposed
because
of
guilt,
as
they
in
fact
generally
are
not
in
punitive
damages
cases.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
no,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
because
punitive
damages
are
not
a
matter
of
compensation,
and...
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
the
perspective
to
look
at
them
from
any
entitlement
of
someone
injured
to
recover
them.
i
mean,
supposedly
they
are
imposed
to
punish
and
deter
because
of
wrongful
conduct.
the
plaintiff
gets
them
is
a
mere
windfall.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
well,
i
have
a
quarrel
with
it,
but
to...
to
seriously
quarrel
with
it
would
require
a
position
that
there
could
be
no
civil
penalties
in
any
case,
and
that
is
not
in
the
history
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
back
to
the
basic
due
process
point
that
i
was
discussing,
the...
it's
the
legislature
in...
neither
the
courts
nor
the
legislature
in
alabama
had
set
any
limits
to
punishment.
the
jury
here
was
told
that
it
had
complete
discretion
to
either
punish
or
not
punish,
as
it
chose,
and
with
respect
to
fixing
the
amount
of
the
award,
it
was
told
only
to--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--i
suggest,
justice
scalia
that
the
situation
here
is...
is
essentially
the
same
as
it
was
in
williams
v.
illinois,
when
you
have
the
practice
which
had
extended
from
medieval
england
down
through
the
united
states
from
the
time
of
the
revolution
and
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
to
the
time
of
that
decision,
of...
of
increasing
penalties
of
prisoners
beyond
the
maximum
allowed
by
statute
when
they
were
unable
to
pay
fines
or
court
costs,
and
there,
as
here,
if
that
had
been
analyzed
and
looked
at,
the
court
would
probably
have
found
that
it
violated
due
process,
just
as
i
submit
that
punitive
damages...
the
procedures--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--that...
the
basis
of
the
decision
was
that
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
to
sentence...
to
allow
a
prisoner
to
be
required
to
serve
time
beyond
the
maximum
allowed
by
the
statute
because
he
was
unable
to
pay
a
fine
or
court
costs,
and
the
court
recognized
that
even
though
that
had
been
the
practice
from
medieval
england
through
all
the
history
of
the
united
states,
it
still
violated
due
process,
and
recognized
that
it
had
only
come
to
the
attention
of
the
court
because
that
practice's
impact
on
society
had
changed
radically.
and
i
submit
that
that--
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
--the...
the
due
process
validity
of
punitive
damages
has
not
been
decided
by
the
court
and
been
directly
before
it.
the
court
has,
in
some
prior
opinions,
recognized
the
doctrine
and
assumed
or
accepted
it.
but
the
issues
have
not
been
placed
before
it
for...
for
an
actual
determination.
i
see
that
i
am
about
out
of
time,
and
with
the
court's
permission,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
a.
beckman
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case,
and
the
common
law
jury
instruction
in
alabama
really
left
the
jury
entirely
to
its
own
internal
resources
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
punish
and,
if
so,
how
much.
it
was
recognized
rather
forthrightly
by
justice
houston
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
a
subsequent
decision
to
ours
that
that
instruction
was
incomprehensibly
vague
and
incomprehensible
as
a
gauge
for
the
jury
to
use
in
measuring
the
amount
of
a
punitive
award.
and
he
noted
the
consequences
of
that
vagueness
in
two
recent
cases
that
had
come
before
the
alabama
supreme
court,
where
he
found
the
facts
to
be
identical
and
the
jury
instructions
to
be
identical,
and
in
fact
identical
to
the
instruction
here,
and
in
one
the
jury
came
in
with
an
award
of
$2,500,000,
and
in
the
other,
$21,000.
in
the
jury
room
when
the
question
came
up,
shall
we
punish
pacific
mutual
for
the
agent's
fraud,
all
it
had
to
go
on
was
its
own
notions
of
right
and
wrong
or
whether
or
no.
all
it
was
told
by
alabama
law
was
that
you
have
discretion.
you
can
if
you
want.
similarly,
when
it
had
decided
to
make
the
award
and
say,
we're
going
to
punish
pacific
mutual
for
the
agent's
fraud,
how
much
should
we
award,
all
the
instructions
told
them
was,
you've
got
discretion.
it's
any
amount
you
want.
i
suggest
that
that
is
exactly
the
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
that
due
process
condemns,
and
would
respond...
in
response
to
respondent's
contention
that
due
process
requires
no
notice
of
penalty,
i'd
suggest
that
that's
a
rather
crabbed
and
narrow
view
of
due
process,
and
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
that
the
fair
notice
portions...
concerns
of
the
ex
post
facto
clauses
are
included
within
the
concept
of
fundamental
fairness
included
in
the
due
process
clauses
of
both
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
if
you
could
imagine
a
statute--
