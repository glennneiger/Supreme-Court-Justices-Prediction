justice
scalia
excuse
me.
why
do
you
say
that
would
be
the
computation
under
alabama
law?
is
it
impossible,
under
law...
under
alabama
law,
to
give
a
plaintiff
more
than
the
plaintiff
prays
for?
justice
scalia
are
there
alabama
cases
that
set
aside
judgments
for
more
than
what
is
prayed
for?
justice
scalia
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
say
she
asked
for
so
much,
and--
justice
scalia
--and
you
subtract
that
from
the
total.
but
the
jury
could
have
said
in
the
jury
room,
couldn't
it,
well,
she
asked
for
that
much,
but
we
really
think
that
her
emotional
distress
was
even
more
than
that
and
we'll
give
her
even
more?
justice
scalia
mr.
beckman,
if
i
understand
the
position
you're
taking
on
this
point,
if...
if
an
officer
of
a
corporation
is
secretly...
secretly
favors
polluting
the
environment,
and
at
great
expense
to
the
company...
not
in
its
interests,
but
at
some
expense
to
the
company...
pollutes...
intentionally
causes
the
company
to
pollute
the
environment,
a
penalty
could
not
be
imposed
upon
the
company
because
the
officer
was
not
acting
in
the
company's
interest?
that's...
that's
your
position?
even
though
the
company
put
this
officer
in
a
position
where
he
could
do
this,
you
know,
put
him
in
charge
of
all
its
chemicals,
so
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
dirty
the
earth,
which
is
what
he
wanted
to
do,
you
couldn't
punish
the
company
for
that?
justice
scalia
it's
different
from
those
cases,
but
it's--
justice
scalia
--but
it
tests
what
i
understood
to
be
your
response
to
justice
stevens.
as
i
understood
your
response
to
justice
stevens,
you
think
the
crucial
factor
is
whether...
whether
you
can
impose
punishment
upon
the
principal
depends
upon
whether
the
agent
was
acting
in
the
principal's
interest.
isn't...
wasn't
that
your...
your
line?
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
so
then
your
answer
to
my
hypothetical
has
to
be
that
you
cannot
punish
the
corporation.
justice
scalia
it
would
deter
the
company
from
putting
such
a
nut
in
such
a
position,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
beckman,
suppose
i
had
a
criminal
statute
that
said
for
this
offense
the
court
may
impose
a
fine
up
to
full
confiscation
of
all
property
of
the
defendant.
you
know
that
the
penalty
is
everything
you
own
if
you
get
convicted.
would
that...
would
that
comport
with
due
process,
and
then
it's--
justice
scalia
--it's
up
to
the
judge
to
decide,
you
know--
justice
scalia
--um-hum.
justice
scalia
but
the
legislature
has,
in
effect,
said
for
each
of
those
offenses,
for
any...
for
any
civil
offense,
you
are
on
notice
that
what
you
can
be
penalized
is
all
of
your
assets.
justice
scalia
why
isn't
that...
you
know.
it's
an
upper
limit.
now,
you
may
not
like
how
high
an
upper
limit
it
is,
but
it
is
certainly
there.
you
know,
when
you
commit
any
tort,
that...
that
that's
the
penalty
that...
that
may
exist.
justice
scalia
well,
let's
take
that
out
of
it.
justice
scalia
we've
place
some
limitations
on
capital
punishment.
i
mean,
it
can
only
be
imposed
for
murder.
but
let's
say...
let's
say
for
all
criminal
offenses
it'll
be
up
to...
up
to
the
judge.
justice
scalia
um-hum.
justice
scalia
because...
because
it...
because
what?
because
of
a
lack
of
procedural
due
process?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
that's
been
going
on
since
1791,
as
i
understand
it.
do...
do...
do
you
have
any...
do
you
have
any
cases
that...
that
have
imagined
in
the
past
that
this
violates
the
due
process
clause,
and
how...
you
know,
who...
who
whispers
in
my
ear
that
it...
it
is
in
violation
of
due
process
when
it's
been
going
on
since
1791
and
nobody
has
thought
so?
justice
scalia
what
was
the
basis
of
that
decision?
justice
scalia
but
this
one
has
come
to
the
attention
of
this
court
before,
and
this
court
has...
has
opinions
that...
that
have
approved
it
before,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
get
off
the
first,
i
don't...
i
don't
quibble
with
your
assertion
that
that
has
been
accepted
for
many
years,
but
i
do...
do
you
really
think
it's
fair
to
call
it
a
standard?
i
mean,
you
say
that
the
standard
is
telling
the
jury,
essentially,
be
sure
that
the
punishment
fits
the
crime.
that...
that
is
what
you
describe
as
a
standard.
justice
scalia
it's
just
like
telling
them,
don't
punish
too
much,
and
don't
punish
too
little.
punish
just
enough.
justice
scalia
well,
of
course.
i
mean,
in
other
words,
don't
punish
too
much
for...
for,
you
know,
how
bad
the
wrong
was.
justice
scalia
i
would
rely
more
on
the
200
years
than
i
would
upon
the
standard.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
ennis,
would
you
apply
your
principle
that
unpredictability
produces
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
to
substantive
liability
as
well,
so
that
if
one
can
show
that,
gee,
lawyers
really
never
know
what's
going
to
happen
when
you
send
a
case
to
the
jury,
except
to
the
extent
that
it
hinges
upon
factors
that
really
should
have
no
bearing...
like
whether
the
defendant
has
deep
pocket
or
not.
if...
if
you
could
show
that,
then
the
whole
system
would
be
infected?
or
does
this
just
apply
to
the
amount
of
the
liability,
not
to
the
liability
itself,
which
would
seem
very
peculiar?
you'd
extend
that
to
the
whole
system,
i
assume.
justice
scalia
what
i'm
asking
is,
if
it
is
true
that
the
amount
of
damages
must
be
predictable
in
order
for
due
process
to
be...
roughly
predictable--
justice
scalia
--i
thought
that
was
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
that
if
the
system
were
entirely
unpredictable--
justice
scalia
--right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
and
the
same
would
be
true
about
whether
the
jury
finds
liability
at
all?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
did
you
think
jury
verdicts
are
predictable
in
that
sense?
do
you...
has
that
ever
been
a
requirement?
justice
scalia
but
they
have
to
be
just
nonarbitrary?
justice
scalia
--that
it
is
no
more
than
is
necessary
to
deter--
justice
scalia
--oh,
so
it...
so
it
isn't
just...
just
what's
necessary
to
deter,
but
also
how
bad
is
the
thing
that
you
want
to
deter?
justice
scalia
so
it...
so
it's
not
just
how
much
is
necessary
to
deter,
but
also
how
much
do
you
hate
what
was
done?
justice
scalia
okay.
yes.
justice
scalia
right.
now,
how
do
you
decide
how
much
you
hate
what
was
done?
justice
scalia
as
a
judge,
in
order
to
apply
this
standard?
justice
scalia
juries
i
would
agree,
but...
but
is
this
really
a
legal...
you
know,
legally
determinable
issue,
how
much
we
hate
this
particular
act?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
element
of
wrongdoing
by
the
defendant
personally,
though.
it
can
be
by
one
of
his
agents,
right?
justice
scalia
that's
a
strange
use
of
"intentionally",
then.
i
mean,
i'm
perfectly
innocent.
i
haven't
committed
any
fraud,
and
i've
been
negligent
enough
to
hire
somebody
who
commits
a
fraud.
that's
intentional
wrongdoing
on
my
part.
justice
scalia
do
i
have
to
do
it
as
a
policy
choice,
mr.
ennis?
justice
scalia
or
because
i
think
it's
the
law?
