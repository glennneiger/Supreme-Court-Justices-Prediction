justice
o'connor
now,
i
suppose
we
do
not
know
the
breakdown
of
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
here?
justice
o'connor
are
you
going
to
supply
the
court
with
citations
to
establish
that
proposition?
justice
o'connor
mr.
beckman,
do
you
have
any
case
authority
from
this
court
to
support
this
rather
curious
position?
justice
o'connor
mr.
beckman,
the
alabama
court
has
handed
down
in
the
green
oil
case
a
list
of
factors
to
be
used
on
appellate
review
of
punitive
damages
cases.
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
now,
in
your
view,
if
the
green
oil
factors
were
spelled
out
to
the
trial
jury
that
fixed
the
punitive
damages,
would
that
adequately
serve
to
guide
the
jury's
discretion?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
here
today
that
the
only
possible
way
to
meet
the
due
process
concerns
that
you
express
is
to
set
a
dollar
limit?
justice
o'connor
that's
a
form
of
a
dollar
limitation.
justice
o'connor
that's
all
you're
saying
would
suffice.
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
say
a
jury
is
instructed
by
the
trial
court
to...
that
it
may
find
punitive
damages
and
it's
within
their
discretion
to
make
that
determination.
justice
o'connor
yes,
sir.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
would
raise
any
due
process
concern
about
standardless
discretion?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
is
a
very
strange
notion
of
what
due
process
means,
then,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
doesn't
the
clause
suggest
to
us
that
wholly
standardless
discretion
in
these
matters
is
unauthorized?
