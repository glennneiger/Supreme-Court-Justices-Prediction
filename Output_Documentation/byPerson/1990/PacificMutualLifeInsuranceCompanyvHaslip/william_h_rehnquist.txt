hear

first
in
number

pacific
mutual
life
insurance
company
v.
cleopatra
haslip.
mr.
beckman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
not
a
constitutional...
constitutionally
permissible
basis
for
imposing
punishment
on
pacific
mutual.
are
you
saying
it
was
not
a
constitutionally
permissible
basis
for
imposing
any
sort
of
liability,
or
just
what
you
call
punishment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
there's
a
different
constitutional
standard
for
respondeat
superior,
in
your
view,
when
you're
talking
about
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
beckman,
we've
been
questioning
you
about
what
you
say
was
your
third
point.
perhaps
you'd
like
to
get
to
your
first
and
second
point.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
beckman.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
test
applied
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
trial
judge's
memorandum
really
reflected
what
the
test
is
supposed
to
reflect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let's
just--
--15
out
of
how
many?
of...
if...
in
15...
it
has
set
them
aside
out
of
how
many
punitive
damages
cases
that
it's
heard?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
how...
how
much
of
a
penalty...
let's
assume
you
have
a
defendant
with
a
net
worth
of
$1
billion.
how
much
is
necessary
to
deter
that...
that
defendant?
the
standard
you
recite
sounds
very
nice.
does
it...
does
it
mean
anything?
how
do
i
go
about
deciding,
as
a
judge
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
or
any
other
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beckman.
the
case
is
submitted.
