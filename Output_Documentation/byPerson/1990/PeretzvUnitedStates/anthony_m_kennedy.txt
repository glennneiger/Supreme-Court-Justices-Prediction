it
seems
to
me
that
your
whole
line
of
argument
here
undercuts
your
concession
or
your
reading
of
gomez.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
either
delegable
with
consent
under
gomez,
or
that
it's
not
waivable.
i
think
there's
a
very
fine
line
you're
trying
to
draw
here
where
you
say
that
it's
nondelegable,
even
with
consent,
but
that
it
can
be
waived.
it
seems
to
me
those
are
really
contradictory.
justice

the
analogy,
i
suppose,
would
be
if
there
were
a
statute
saying
you
cannot
stipulate
as
to
any
given
line
of
evidence,
and
the
parties
stipulated
that
certain
evidence
could
be
introduced.
i
suppose,
that's
the
only
example
i
can
think
of.
