mr.
joel
b.
rudin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
in
the
case
of
gomez
against
united
states,
the
critical
jury
selection
stage
of
petitioner's
felony
trial
was
conducted
by
a
magistrate
from
whom
congress
had
withheld
the
authority
to
preside.
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
this
was
error.
the
principal
issue
about
which
the
parties
disagree
is
whether
or
not
the
issue
was
preserved
for
this
court's
review
despite
counsel's
purported
consent
on
petitioner's
behalf.
we
say
the
issue
was
preserved
because
the
defect
was
not
subject
to
waiver,
and
that
if
it
was
subject
to
waiver
the
requisite
statutory
or
constitutional
waiver
standard
was
not
met.
the
framers
gave
congress
exclusive
power
to
create
the
inferior
tribunals,
or
tribunals
inferior
to
this
court,
to
invest
these
tribunals
with
jurisdiction,
to
authorize
the
appointment
of
officers
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction,
and
to
allocate
or
to
distribute
power
to
be
exercised
by
these
officers.
the
framers
gave
congress
the
exclusive
power
to
adjust
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction
in
the
lower
federal
courts
to
meet
changing
societal
needs,
so
long
as
the
adjustment
was
within
the
constraints
of
article
iii.
the
magistrates
act
was
an
attempt
by
congress
to
do
just
that,
to
meet
the
litigation
explosion
of
the
latter
part
of
the
20th
century
by
creating
the
new
office
of
magistrate,
by
defining
its
jurisdiction
powers
and
duties,
and
then,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
gomez,
by
carefully
circumscribing
magistrates'
trial
jurisdiction
in
the
interest
of
policy
as
well
as
constitutional
constraints.
congress
gave
magistrates
consent
trial
jurisdiction
in
the
area
of
misdemeanor
and
petty
offense
trials
and
for
civil
trials,
but
withheld
consent
trial
jurisdiction
for
magistrates
in
felony
cases.
and
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
this
withholding
applies
to
the
critical
voir
dire
stage
of
a
felony
trial.
a
district
court
may
not
override
congress'
policy
judgment
to
withhold
this
jurisdiction
from
magistrates,
and
petitioner
could
not
consent
to
consent
trial
jurisdiction
being
exercised
when
congress
had
withheld
such
trial
jurisdiction.
and
in
our
view
any
such
consent
would
be
a
nullity,
and
therefore
counsel's
waiver
was
a
nullity
and
could
not
prevent
petitioner
from
raising
the
defect
on
appeal.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
your
honor,
it
was
not
an
effective
waiver.
it
was...
i
am
using
the
term
a
purported
waiver.
it
was
a...
it
could
not
be
an
effective
waiver
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
just
explained,
and
as
i
will
go
on
later
in
my
argument
to
explain,
even
if
a
waiver
could
be
made
in
this
area
it
would
have
to
meet
the
standards
set
by
congress
and
by
the
constitution
in
order
for
the
waiver
to
forfeit
petitioner's
right
to
appeal.
an
officer's...
the
glidden
case,
we
believe,
disposes
of
this
case,
at
least
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
error
may
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
in
the
glidden
case,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
harlan,
the
court
reached
the
merits
of
the
petitioner's
article
iii
argument
even
though
the
court
that
delegated
power
to
an
officer,
who
arguably
was
not
an
article
iii
officer,
itself
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
your
honor,
that
was
an
opinion
by
justice
harlan
for
a
plurality
of
the
court.
it
was
an
opinion
joined
by
two
other
members
of
the
court.
but
there
were
four
other
members
of
the
court
who
participated
in
the
decision,
two
in
a
dissenting
opinion
and
two
in
a
plurality
opinion,
and
none
of
them
took
issue
with
justice
harlan's
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
error
could
be
reviewed
by
the
court,
even
though
the
petitioners
had
not
objected
in
the
courts
below.
in
the
glidden
case
there
were
two
matters
that
were
consolidated.
one
case
involved
a
criminal
trial
in
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
a
judge
from
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
presided.
and
the
petitioner
argued
that
that
judge
was
not
an
article
iii
judge
and
therefore,
consistent
with
the
constitution,
could
not
preside.
the
other
case
involved
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
in
which
one
of
the
three
judges
who
was
designated
to
preside
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
and
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
was
a
court
of
claims
judge.
and
again,
petitioner
argued
that
that
judge
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
preside
under
article
iii.
justice
harlan
in
his
opinion
treated
this
defect
as
a
nonwaivable
jurisdictional
type
defect
because
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
to
permit
this
court
to
protect
institutional
interests
that
were
far
broader
than
the
narrow
interests
of
an
individual
litigant.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
premise
of
your
honor's
question
because
it...
my
understanding
of
article
iii
is
that
for
an
officer
to
exercise
judicial
authority
under
article
iii
there
need
not
only
be
inherent
authority
for
congress
to
confer
the
jurisdiction,
but
congress
in
fact
has
to
then
confer
the
jurisdiction.
in
the
schor
case
and
all
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
discussed
article
iii
issues
and
the
exercise
of
power
by
nonarticle
iii
officers
or
the
exercise
of
judicial
power
by
adjuncts,
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases
the
power
was
exercised
pursuant
to
a
statutory
scheme.
it's
well
established--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--well,
your
honor,
we
certainly
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
i
am
prepared
to
argue
this
morning
that
there
was
an
inherent
violation
of
article
iii,
that
had
congress
authorized
this
function
to
be
exercised,
that
it
would
have
violated
article
iii.
but
congress
did
not
even
authorize
the
function
to
be
exercised.
and
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
and
over
again
that
there
is
no
authority
or
jurisdiction
for
an
officer
to
exercise
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
in
an
article
iii
setting
unless
congress
has
authorized
that
exercise
of
power.
that
was
true
in
the
schor
case.
in
the
schor
case
the
petitioner,
or
the
litigant,
invited
an
article
i
tribunal
before
the
cftc
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
his...
that
petitioner's
claim.
and
even
though
petitioner
had
invited
the
tribunal
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction,
this
court
still
reached
the
merits
of
the
petitioner's
structural
article
iii
claim,
even
though
it
could
be
said
that
petitioner
had
invited
the
jurisdictional
error.
there
is
simply
no
such
thing
as
invited
jurisdictional
error.
the
same
rule
was
applied
in
the
owen
equipment
and
erection
company
against
kroeger
case,
which
is
not
in
my
brief,
437
u.s.
365.
there
the
petitioner
had
concealed
his
citizenship
at
the
trial
court
level,
and
thereby
concealed
from
the
district
court
that
there
was
a
lack
of
diversity.
and
on
appeal
the
petitioner
was
permitted
to
raise
lack
of
diversity
before
this
court,
and
this
court
dismissed
the
civil
action.
the
same
result
in
american
fire
and
casualty
company
against
finn,
341
u.s.
6.
the
petitioner
in
that
case
asked
the
district
court
to
remove
an
action
that
had
been
brought
in
the
state
court
under
the
statutory
removal
jurisdiction
established
by
congress.
the
district
court
did
remove
the
case.
and
then
on
appeal
to
this
court
the
petitioner
successfully
argued
that
that
removal
jurisdiction
had
been
erroneously
exercised
because
it
exceeded
what
congress
had
authorized.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
there
can
be
a
distinction
made
between
whether
or
not
the
court
that
delegates
the
authority
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
the
jurisdiction
or
the
authority
of
the
officer
who
actually
exercises
the
jurisdiction.
in
this
case
the
government
correctly
concedes
that
the
court
that
purported
to
delegate
its
jurisdiction
did
not
have
the
authority
to
make
that
delegation,
and
congress
prohibited
the
district
courts
from
making
this
type
of
delegation.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
significant
as
to
whether
or
not
the
officer
who
exercises
the
jurisdiction,
which
is
really
the
matter
that
we
should
be
concerned
with,
who
actually
exercises
the
jurisdiction,
in
this
case
that
officer,
the
magistrate,
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
did
not
have
power
given
to
him
by
congress
to
preside
over
the
subject
matter
of
a
felony
trial
or
a
critical
stage
of
that
trial,
and
that
being
voir
dire.
in
the
northern
pipeline
case
an
argument
was
made
that
bankruptcy
judges
were
adjuncts
of
the
district
court,
and
that
it
was
the
district
court
that
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
the
bankruptcy
judges
derived
jurisdiction
from
the
jurisdiction
that
the
district
courts
had.
and
this
court,
in
a
plurality
opinion,
termed
that
a
facade...
that
the
jurisdictional
grant
was
a
facade
because
the
officer
who
actually
exercised
the
jurisdiction
was
not
in
power
to
do
so.
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
happened
in
glidden.
in
the
glidden
case
the
district
court
that
sat
at
a
criminal
trial
and
the
court
of
appeals
which
sat
at
an
appeal
of
a
civil
trial,
clearly
those
two
courts
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
the
officer
who
actually
exercised
the
jurisdiction
did
not.
and
justice
harlan
felt
that
that
was
akin
to
a
jurisdictional
error
or
at
least
should
be
treated
by
the
court
as
a
jurisdictional-type
error
so
that
the
court
could
reach
the
truly
important
interest,
which
was
not
whether
or
not
an
individual
litigant
was
deserving
of
a
new
trial
or
whether
or
not
he
somehow
could
be
blamed
for
not
having
made
an
explicit
objection,
but
rather
to
protect
the
proper
administration
of
judicial
business,
which
is
this
court's
obligation
in
the
federal
system.
that
is
the
way
justice
harlan
put
it.
and
also
to
protect
the
constitutional
plan
of
checks
and
balances
and
separation
of
powers.
if
the
error
that
occurred
to
this
case...
that
occurred
in
this
case
is
treated
as
waivable,
and
therefore
this
court
does
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
error
which
the
government
concedes,
then
there
will
be
no
change
in
the
law
in
the
second
and
the
third
circuits.
both
those
circuits
have
held
that
the
magistrate
does
have
power
under
the
additional
dutie
clause,
despite
this
court's
analysis
in
gomez,
to
preside
at
voir
dire.
as
recently
as
within
the
last
6
months
a
judge
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
attempted,
with
the
defendant's
consent
that
he
asked
for
and
obtained,
to
delegate
voir
dire
to
a
magistrate.
and
the
government
had
to
go
to
the
second
circuit
in
in
re
sayeedi
and
ask
the
second
circuit
to
grant
the
writ
of
mandamus
to
prevent
the
judge
from
doing
that.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
obvious
reason
the
judge
did...
the
government
did
that
was
that
they
were
concerned
that
built-in
reversible
error
would
occur.
interestingly,
in
the
second
circuit
in
their
opinion
in
sayeedi,
even
though
they
had
held
in
the
musacchia
case
that,
despite
gomez,
it
was
okay
for
a
magistrate
to
conduct
felony
voir
dire
if
the
defendant
did
not
make
a
written
motion
under
rule
12(b)(2)
asserting
his
right
to
voir
dire
before
a
district
judge,
the
second
circuit
in
sayeedi
said
that
for
the
government
it
was
okay
to
object
at
the
time
of
trial.
and
it
equated
the
right
involved
for
the
government
as
equal
to
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
and
said
that
if
the
government,
if
trial
by
jury
can
only
occur,
a
waiver
of
that
can
only
occur
where
the
defendant
makes
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
consent
and
if
the
government
makes
a
consent
as
well,
then
this
right
is
at
least
as
important
and
that
therefore
the
government
should
be
entitled
to
object
to
protect
all
of
society's
interests.
this
was
a
classic
separation
of
powers
or
checks
and
balances-type
error.
the
district
judge,
in
what
could
be
referred
to
as
a
power
grab
from
congress,
took
over
from
congress
its
exclusive
authority
under
the
constitution
to
determine
the
allocation
of
power
in
the
district
courts.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--well,
your
honor,
there
i
would
distinguish
between
a
procedural
violation
and
a
jurisdictional
violation.
i
think
that
where
the
congress
has
given...
the
courts
have
certain
discretion
over
the
procedure
that
they
employ
to
adjudicate
matters
that
congress
has
granted
them
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate,
but
this
is
a
substantive
jurisdictional
question.
it's
not
a
mere
question
of
procedure.
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
view
this
as
a
procedural
issue
rather
than
a
jurisdictional
or
separation
of
powers
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
has
answered
the
question
there
as
well,
and
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
procedural
right
is
waivable
can
be
determined
merely
by
analyzing
the
statute.
of
course
in
the
gomez
case
this
court
relied
upon
the
familiar
principle
that
the
court
will
attempt
to
construe
statutes
to
avoid
constitutional
issues,
especially
issues
involving
separation
of
powers.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
no,
your
honor,
it's...
this
case
really
has,
it
seems
to
me,
has
two
components
in
terms
of
the
separation
of
powers
analysis.
and
what's
strange
about
it
is
that
up
until,
certainly
during
the
gomez
case
and
in
the
cases
that
followed
gomez
the
issue
has
been
analyzed
as
whether
or
not
congress
infringed
upon
the
power
of
the
judiciary
by
authorizing
magistrates
to
carry
out
this
function.
but
what
is
strange
about
it
is
that
as
the
government
concedes,
congress
did
not
authorize
magistrates
to
carry
out
this
function.
so
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
congress
is
infringing
upon
the
power
of
the
judiciary
when
the
judiciary
asserts
a
basically
inherent
authority
to
transfer,
to
delegate
its
jurisdiction
to
someone
from
whom
congress
has
withheld
that
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
separation
of
powers
problems
here
and
the
problem
of
checks
and
balances
under
the...
as
the
framers
intended
that
to
work,
is
that
the
district
court
here
asserted
its
right
to
delegate
power,
and
this
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
that
repeatedly
uses
terms
like
"jurisdiction"
and
"power
to
preside",
to
a
magistrate
that
congress
had
implicitly
forbidden
to
exercise
that
power.
and
so
the
problem--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--but
a
jurisdictional
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
that
is
true.
but
there
is
no
other
source
of
authority
for
an
officer,
a
judicial
officer
to
act,
except
to
the
extent
that
that
officer
is
empowered
by
congress
to
do
so.
the
framers
gave
that
power
to
congress
because
the
framers
believed
that
congress
was
best
situated
to
adjust
the
allocation
of
power
in
the
federal
courts
to
meet
changing
social
needs.
congress
could
have
decided,
for
example,
that
the
way
to
deal
with
the
litigation
explosion
and
the
overloading
of
the
federal
courts
was
to
strip
the
courts
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
that
certainly
would
have...
would
have
eased
the
burden
somewhat.
or
congress
could
have
decided
that
because
the
volume
of
misdemeanor
and
petty
offense
cases
is
so
great,
and
perhaps
compared
to
the
volume
of
felonies
maybe
there
are
less
felonies,
that
we'll
allow
magistrates
to
preside
at
felonies
and
not
criminal
trials
or
petty
offenses.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
is
that
the
judicial
power
under
article
iii
must
in
the
final
analysis
be
exercised,
especially
in
a
criminal
case,
by
an
article
iii
judge.
that
is
why--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--well,
it
speaks
to
the
issue,
but
i
don't
think
it
determines
the
issue.
the
reason
is
that,
of
course
in
raddatz,
the
court
repeatedly,
explicitly
relied
on
the
existence
of
a
very
careful
statutory
scheme
which
provided
guidance
for
the
court
and
for
the
parties
as
to
the
procedure
to
be
followed,
that
in
the
statutory
scheme
required
that
the
magistrate
make
written
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
that
it's
recommended
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
which
the
district
judge
was
obligated
to
review
independently
and
to
go
on
to
review
de
novo
any
aspects
of
the
magistrate's
decision
that
a
party
objected
to.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
what
the
raddatz
case,
i
think,
went
to
great
pains
to
point
out
with
the
decision
it
pointed
out
was
that
the
degree
of
review
that
must
be
provided
under
article
iii
must
be
directly
related
to
the
importance
of
the
interest
under
article
iii
that
is
in
question.
that's
why
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
why
the
raddatz
case
focused
on
the
distinction
between
the
interest
at
stake
in
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing,
where
the
ultimate
question
of
truth
or
innocence
is
not
involved,
and
the
trial
itself.
that
was
the
reason,
i
believe,
why
justice
marshall
in
raddatz
dissented,
because
justice
marshall
did
not
accept
that
distinction.
but
that
was
a
distinction
urged
by
the
government.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
the
misdemeanor
trial...
this
court
has
not
reached
that
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
misdemeanor
trial
may
be
delegated
to
a
magistrate.
other
courts,
lower
courts,
have.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
raddatz
and
northern
pipeline,
schor...
all
the
court's
article
iii
cases
have
looked
in
the
first
instance
to
the
importance
of
the
function
under
article
iii
that
is
at
stake.
then
the
court
has
gone
on
to
look
at
whether
the
review
procedure
provided
by
a
statute
is
sufficient
to
protect
the
interest
underlying
article
iii.
in
the
raddatz
case
the
court
found
that
the
procedure
was
sufficient
because
it
provided
for
a
very
careful
review
procedure.
the
magistrate
made
written
findings.
the
parties
had
10
days
to
make
written
objections.
the
magistrate
could
rehear
testimony.
the
gomez
case,
on
the
other
hand,
points
out
that
that
is...
that
even
if
such
a
procedure
was
provided
by
statute,
and
here
congress
did
not
provide
for
any
such
procedure
over
felony
voir
dire,
it
almost
certainly
would
not
be
sufficient.
there
is
no
way
for
a
reviewing
court
to
review
credibility
or
demeanor-type
determinations
made
by
the
judge
who
presides
pertaining
to
the
fitness
of
a
juror
to
preside.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
the
reason,
your
honor,
i...
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
reasoning
underlying
your
honor's
question
would
also
justify
having
the
entire
trial
assigned
to
a
magistrate.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
jury-selection
phase
of
the
trial
is,
if
anything,
the
one
phase
where
the
trial
judge's
role
is
most
important.
it's
the
one
stage
of
the
trial
where
the
court
itself
is
making
subjective
credibility
determinations
that
are
not
subject
to
review.
how
could
the
district
court,
for
example
in
this
case,
have
reviewed
the
determination
by
a
magistrate
to
excuse
a
particular
juror
over
the
defendant's
objection
at
the
government's
request?
i
submit
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
colloquy,
the
colloquy
does
suggest
that
perhaps
the
juror
was
biased,
but
it
was
by
no
means
conclusive.
and
so
the
magistrate
had
to
rely
upon
her
subjective
evaluation
of
the
juror's
credibility
and
bias
or
lack
of
bias.
and
that
is
not
something
that
the
district
judge
could
have
reviewed
without
questioning
the
juror
all
over
again.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor,
but
the
difference
is
that
at
a
suppression
hearing
there
is
no
jury
present.
there
are
no
third
parties
who
are
being
affected
by
the
goings-on.
if
the
magistrate,
if
the
judge
chooses
to
hold
the
whole
suppression
hearing
all
over
again,
there
won't
be
any
impact
on
the
trier
of
fact
at
the
trial.
but
here
it's
the
trier
of
fact
itself
that
is
being
impacted.
anything
that
the
magistrate
says,
anything
that
a
participant
in
the
process
says
is
having
an
impact
on
these
prospective
jurors.
plus,
there's
an
inseparable
relationship
between
the
jury
selection
and
what
goes
on
at
the
trial.
the
trial
judge
establishes
his
control
of
the
jury.
the
trial
judge
sets
a
tone
for
the
entire
trial.
the
trial
judge
must
impress
upon
the
jury
the
importance
of
the
proceedings
and
of
the
legal
principles,
such
as
presumption
of
innocence
and
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
he
obtains
candid
answers.
the
trial
judge
must
learn
about
the
intellectual
functioning
of
the
jury
so
he
can
decide
later
one
whether
or
not,
under
rule
403,
to
admit
evidence
even
though
it's...
the
defense
counsel
argues
that
the
evidence's
likelihood
of
prejudicing
the
jury
outweighs
its
probative
value.
the
trial
judge
has
to
decide
later
on
during
the
trial
whether
or
not
to
exercise
his
discretion
to
admit
expert
testimony.
he
has
to
decide
about
his
charge
to
the
jury.
these
are
all
things
that--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--i
think
that
it,
it
is
influenced
to
some
extent
by
his
view
of
the
ability
of
the
jury
as
a
whole
to
understand
the
evidence,
with
or
without
the
assistance
of--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--your
honor,
i
think
that
ordinarily
the
capability
of
the
jury
or
the
composition
of
the
jury
would
not
affect
that
determination,
but
in
a
close
case
it
might.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
defers
to
that
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
judge.
i
mean,
all
the
district
judge's,
or
most
of
his
discretionary
determinations
during
the
course
of
a
trial
are
reviewed
by
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
he
is
present,
including
during
the
jury-selection
phase,
and
has
a
handle
on
the
entire
proceeding.
turning
again
to
the
statutory
issue
of
whether
or
not
this--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--yes,
but
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
to
admit
expert
testimony,
the
district
judge
is
afforded
wide
discretion.
and
my
point
is
only
that
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
he
is
aware
of
everything
that
has
gone
on,
including
the
composition
of
the
jury.
certainly
if
there
is
a
juror
disqualification
question
that
arises
it
is
necessary
that
he
be
aware
of
these...
the
qualities
of
specific
jurors.
as
to
the
question
of
waiverability,
as
viewing
this
as
a
procedural
right,
we
believe
that
this
is
akin...
the
analysis
should
be
akin
to
the
analysis
that
has
been
applied
to
the
requirement
under
rule
31(a)
for
a
unanimous
verdict.
justice
kennedy
in
the
lopez
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a
holding
that
has
been
joined
by
six
out
of
seven
circuits,
held
that
the
right
to
a
unanimous
verdict
is
simply
not
waivable
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it
is
clear
that
congress
may
fix
standards
for
waiverability
that
control
whether
or
not
a
right
can
be
waived.
that
reasoning
applies
to
the
magistrates
act.
congress
permitted
the
right
to
trial
before
a
district
court
to
be
waived
in
civil
and
misdemeanor
and
petty
offense
cases,
but
not
in
felony
cases.
congress...
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
points
relied
on
in
the
lopez
case
and
the
other
case.
congress
was
concerned,
with
the
waiver
of
a
unanimous
verdict
requirement...
the
inherent
coercion
of
a
request
from
a
district
judge
during
the
midst
of
jury
deliberations,
and
did
not
want
to
put
a
defendant
in
that
situation.
well,
we
submit
that
that
was
the
same
concern
that
congress
had
with
waiver
in
the
magistrates
context.
congress
in
the
civil
consent
part
of
the
act
explicitly
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
language
that
the
clerk
put
the
question
to
the
litigant,
not
the
judge,
because
of
the
inherent
coerciveness
of
it.
and
in
the
criminal
context
required
a
knowing,
written,
intelligent,
voluntary
waiver
on
the
record,
also
to
ensure
voluntariness.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
congress,
we
submit,
made
this
right
nonwaivable
for
felonies,
because
the
interests
at
stake
in
a
felony
trial
are
simply
far
greater.
finally,
we
believe
that
the
critical
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
issue
was
preserved
for
review.
if
the
issue
was
preserved
for
review
because
an
injection
was
not
required,
or
because
a
consent
would
be
ineffective,
or
because
a
waiver
had
to
meet
a
standard
set
by
congress
or
the
constitution
that
was
not
met
in
this
case,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
turn
to
plain
error
analysis.
plain
error
analysis
only
applies
where
an
issue
is
not
preserved
for
review
because
of
a
failure
to
meet
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement.
in
the
gomez
case
this
court
held
that
this
error
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
and
therefore
if
the
court
reaches
the
merits
in
this
case,
as
we
submit
that
it
should,
it
must
reverse
the
conviction.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
the
defect
that
occurred
in
this
case
was
not
waivable,
then
we
submit
that
no
objection
was
required.
and
if
no
objection
was
required,
then
the
court
cannot
punish
this
defendant
for
not
having
made
an
objection.
second
of
all,
mr.
bryson
has
left
out
of
his
analysis
a
critical
exception
to
the
plain
error
rule,
and
that
exception
is
that
where
congress
fixes
the
waiver
standard,
whether
it
be
by
the
johnson
v.
zerbst
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary
standard
or
that
it
be
not
waivable
at
all,
the
court
cannot
require
the
defendant
to
object.
again,
the
court
cannot
punish
the
defendant
for
not,
for
failing
to
object
when
the
right
that's
involved
is
such
an
important
structural
right
that
congress
has
required
either
that
it
not
be
waivable
or
that
any
waiver
by
the
defendant
meet
the
johnson
v.
zerbst
standard.
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
this
case
can
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
the
constitutional
issues
that
have
been
raised
this
morning
can
be
avoided.
the
reason
is--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--if
congress
makes
a
determination,
your
honor,
that
a
particular
procedure,
or
i
shouldn't
say
procedure,
that
a
particular
exercise
of
power
is
something
that
cannot
be
done
by
a
particular
judicial
officer,
then
all
i
am
arguing
is
that
an
objection
cannot
be
required
to
that
exercise
of
power,
because
it's
congress'
prerogative
in
taking
into
account
all
sorts
of
societal
interests
that
go
beyond
the
narrow
interest
of
the
defendant
not
to
make
it
waivable.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
can
be
paternalistic
and
can
say
that
the
right
is
so
important,
the
right
to
trial
before
a
proper
judge
or
trial
before
the
proper
entity,
as
the
court
put
it
in
gomez,
is
so
important
that
we're
not
going
to
permit
a
judge
to
ask
a
defendant
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
waive
that
right,
where
the
judge
is
the
person
who
will
be
presiding
at
the
balance
of
the
trial
and
will
be
able
to
sentence
the
defendant
upon
conviction,
as
in
this
case,
to
life
in
prison.
mr.
peretz
was
charged
with
a
mandatory
10
year
offense
where
he
was
facing
up
to
life
in
prison.
finally,
the
government
keeps
on
trying
to
trivialize
the
defect
that
occurred
in
this
case.
the
defect
occurred
involving
what
this
court
in
gomez
called
a
critical
stage
of
trial,
where
the
right
to
trial
before
a
judge
of
competent
jurisdiction
attached.
this
court
uses
the
term
"critical",
calls
a
right
critical
when
it's
not
de
minimis
or
not
inconsequential.
the
court
in
gomez
pointed
out
the
inseparability
between--
