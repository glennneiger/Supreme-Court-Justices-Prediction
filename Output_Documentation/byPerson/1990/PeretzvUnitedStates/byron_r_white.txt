waiver?
justice
white
i
suppose
it
would
take
two
other
people
to
carry
that
out.
justice
white
the
prosecutor
and
the
magistrate
would
have
to
connive,
too,
wouldn't
they?
justice
white
well,
you
say,
you
tell
us...
you're
telling
us
what
plain
error
is.
what
is
harmless
error
or
harmful
error?
justice
white
you
don't
think
it
means
inevitably
harmful?
justice
white
well,
what
if
it
did?
what
if
it
did?
justice
white
what
if
it
did?
what
if...
i
suppose
in
certain
contexts...
i
suppose
you
could
say
it
would
be
inevitable,
harmless
error...
harmful
error
means
inevitably
harmful.
justice
white
something
really
harmful.
justice
white
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing,
i
suppose,
if
you
want
to
imagine
something,
that
the
judge
assigned
the
entire
trial
of
a
felony
case--
justice
white
--to
a
magistrate?
justice
white
of
course
it
would
be
different
if
the
defendant
objected?
justice
white
well,
it
certainly
would
be
error,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
and
if
there
was
an
objection,
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
new
trial,
wouldn't
there?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
know
that
you
could
say
gomez
says
that.
justice
white
why
do
you
think--
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
and
say
that
even
with
consent
a
magistrate
can't
try
a
felony
case.
where
are
you
then?
justice
white
because?
justice
white
and
because...
and
do
you
rely
on
supervision--
justice
white
--i
thought
gomez
really
questioned
the
whole
business
of
the
efficacy
of
a
judge
reviewing
voir
dires.
justice
white
didn't
it?
justice
white
so
you
don't
mind
us,
our
just
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
assuming
that
the
magistrate
in
no
circumstances
could
try
a
felony?
justice
white
and
that
we
should
then,
then
address
whether
or
not
conducting
a
voir
dire
is
part
of
a
felony
trial,
or--
