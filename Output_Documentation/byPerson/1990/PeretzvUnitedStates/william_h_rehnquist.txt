chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-615,
rafael
peretz
against
the
united
states.
mr.
rudin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
an
opinion
of
the
court,
mr.
rudin,
in
glidden?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course
those
cases
deal
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
i
really
don't
think
yours
does.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
call
this
a
separation
of
powers
case
is,
i
think,
a
misnomer.
i
mean,
the
magistrate
is
not
doing
something...
he's
being
supervised
by
an
article
iii
judge.
it's
not
as
if
somehow
the
judicial
power
is
being
infringed
on.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
a
violation
of
a
law
passed
by
congress.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
call
it
a
jurisdictional
statute.
i
mean,
that's
a
cloak
of
many
colors.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
his
determination
as
to
whether
to
admit
expert
testimony
depends
on
his
evaluation
of
the
competence
of
a
particular
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words
the
same
judge,
faced
with
the
same
question
of
admissibility
of
expert
testimony,
the
only
difference
being
two
different
juries,
might
decide
well,
i
think
jury
a
can
handle
it,
but
i
think
jury
b
can't
handle
it?
that's
a
very
strange
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
evidentiary
rulings
reviewed
on
appeal
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard?
i
don't
think
they
are.
factual
determinations
are.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rudin.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
magistrate
could
have
conducted
a
perfect
trial--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
then
still,
under
gomez--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
would
be
reversible.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
why
would
that
be,
do
you
suppose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--your
hypothesis
is
with
consent,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
rudin,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rudin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-615,
peretz
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
