mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
very
briefly
by
addressing
the
point
raised
near
the
end
of
the
argument
with
respect
to
rule
31
and
the
nonwaivability
of
unanimous
jury.
the
court
in
lopez,
through
justice
kennedy
sitting
as
a
circuit
justice...
judge...
held
that
the
rule
itself,
viewing
it
to
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
rule,
indicated
that
a
unanimous
jury
was
nonwaivable.
that
was
a
construction
of
the
rule,
and
obviously
congress
or
this
court,
through
its
rule...
the
promulgation
of
the
rules...
can
decide
that
a
particular
error
will
be
nonwaivable.
if
it
says
so
in
effect
or
in
plain
language,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
congressional
declaration
that
a
particular
error
is
nonwaivable,
and
therefore
we
have
to
look
at
more
general
principles...
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
the
invited
error
doctrine...
and
ask
whether
in
this
particular
case
there
is
anything
that
takes
this
case
and
like
cases
out
of
those
doctrines.
now,
it's
important
to
emphasize,
i
think,
at
the
outset
that
this
case
involves
a
very
narrow
question
of
remedy.
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
is
true,
as
we
see
it,
that
there
was
an
error.
but
the
question
is
what
is
the
consequence
of
the
error
in
this
particular
case.
is
it...
does
it
require
reversal.
and
we
submit
that
there
should
be
very
few
case
where
the
law
will
say
that...
or
will
recognize
a
defendant
coming
in
and
saying
yes,
i
asked
for
a
particular
procedure,
yes,
i
got
the
procedure
that
i
asked
for,
but
no,
i
wasn't
entitled
to
it
and
therefore
please
reverse
my
conviction.
in
our
view
that's
what
this
case
comes
down
to,
and
we
have
to
ask
the
question
is
there
some
reason
that
we
are
required
to
reverse
in
this
case,
in
spite
of
the
defendant's
having
asked
for
the
procedure,
precisely
the
procedure
that
he
got.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
could--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
key
element
in
the
evasion,
if
it
were
to
occur,
of
course,
would
be
the
district
court,
which
has
complete
control
over
whether
a
reference
to
the
magistrate
is
made.
and
i
submit,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
true,
your
honor.
but
i
think
you
can't
assume
that
district
judges
will
simply
disregard
this
court's
decision
if
this
court
decides--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
isn't
a
question
of
harm.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
there
has
been
no
harm
done,
but
not...
it's
not
the
case
that
everything
is
fine.
what's
happened
is
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
law.
the
district
judge,
to
assign
a
jury
selection
to
a
magistrate,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
law,
as
we
believe
it
is,
would
have
to
say
so
what,
i
am
going
to
assign
it
to
a
magistrate
anyway...
even
though
i
know
it's
a
violation
of
the
law.
and
we
submit
that
isn't
something
that
district
judges
are
going
to
do.
i
think
they
recognize
the
difference
between
something
that
is
error
and
may
not
be
done,
and
something
that
is
authorized
to
be
done.
and
in
effect
i'd
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
ford
case,
which
was
the
en
banc
fifth
circuit
case
in
which
this
issue
was
specifically
addressed
in
the
majority
which
held
that,
number
one,
the
jury
selection
could
not
be
referred
to
a
magistrate,
but
number
two,
found
that
it
was
not
plain
error
in
that
case
because
the
matter
was
not
raised
by
the
defendant.
and
there's
a
footnote
at
the
end
of
the
en
banc
majority's
opinion
in
which
the
court
said
we
assume
confidently
that
district
judges
will
not
simply
disregard
our
holding
and
assign
things
to
the
magistrates,
even
though
there
may
be
consent
to
the
doing
of
that.
i
would...
i
think
there's
an
analogy,
if
i
may,
with
a
case
a
few
years
ago
from
this
court,
parker
against
randolf,
which
held
that
a...
the
introduction,
i
believe,
of
cross-corroborating
confessions
was
error
but
it
was
always
harmless
error.
now,
you
could
say,
of
course,
well,
district
judges
could
simply
introduce...
allow
that
kind
of
evidence
to
come
in
because
it
will
always
be
regarded
as
harmless
error
and
never,
therefore
never
result
in
reversal.
but
the
answer
to
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
district
court
to
follow
the
law.
we
can
assume
the
district
courts
will
follow
the
law.
and
the
fact
that
the
consequence
will
not
be
reversal
of
the
conviction
doesn't
mean
the
district
judges
will
disregard
their
obligations.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
but
even
let's
even
assume
that
everybody
wanted
a
magistrate
to
conduct
the
jury
voir
dire.
i
think
it
is
assuming
a
disregard
for
the
law
on
the
part
of
the
district
judges
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
assuming.
if
we
have,
as
we
do,
a
general
principle
that
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
and
especially
in
its
more
aggravated
form,
the
invited
error
doctrine,
is
applicable
generally
to
errors,
and
errors
in
this
case
of
statutory
violations,
what
are
the
exceptions
to
that
rule
that
could
conceivably
apply
in
this
case?
we
submit
there
are
three
possible
exceptions,
and
we
suggest
that
none
of
them
applies
here.
first,
the
plain
error
doctrine.
second,
the
doctrine
which
petitioner
relies
on
most
heavily,
of
jurisdictional
nonwaivable
error.
and
third,
a
nonwaivable
article
iii
error.
now,
first
with
respect
to
plain
error.
plain
error
requires
a
showing
that
there
has
been
essentially
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
that
there
has
been
something
that
has
gone
terribly
wrong,
an
egregious
error
in
the
proceedings
that
result
in
great
prejudice
to
the
defense,
going
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
this
case
simply
does
not
have
any
element
of
that.
it
is
true
that
this
court
in
gomez
held
that
the
court
would
not
recognize
the
harmless
error
doctrine
in
respect
to
magistrate
conducting
voir
dire,
but
that
is
a
very
different
matter
from
saying
that
plain
error
is
applicable.
this
court
demonstrated
that
distinction,
i
think,
in
the
grand
jury
context
when,
in
vasquez
against
hillery,
the
court
held
that
you
could
not
have
a
harmless
error
doctrine
with
respect
to
claims
of
the
unlawful
exclusion
of
persons
on
the
basis
of
race
from
a
grand
jury.
but
that
did
not
override
this
court's
prior
decisions
that
such
an
error
was
not
plain
error.
the
distinction,
it
seems
to
us,
is
clear
and
is
based
on
the
very
limited
nature
of
a
plain
error,
which
is
that
it
has
to
go
to
the
merits
of
the
case
or
somehow
reflect
on
the
integrity
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings,
which
this
surely
does
not.
this...
and
particularly
in
this
particular
case
there
is
no
claim
that
there
was
anything
about
this
jury
selection
procedure.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
harmful
error
is
anything
as
to
which
you
cannot
say
with
confidence,
or
in
the
case
of
constitutional
error
great
confidence,
did
not
result
in
either--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
i
think
it
means
that
you
simply
can't
be
sure--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
it
was
not
harmful.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
degree.
the
kind
of
harmful
or
harm
that
has
to
ensue,
i
think,
for
something
to
be
plain
error
is
not
simply
something
that
could
conceivably
have
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
but
it
has
to
be
something
that
really
renders
the
proceedings
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
has
to
be
really
harmful,
that's
right.
egregious
error,
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
something
as
to
which
you
say
this
judgment
simply
cannot
stand
even
though
there
was
no
objection.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right,
and
that's
my
third
category.
and
you
could
have
a
structural
violation
under
article
iii,
which
then
would
be
cognizable
within
the
context
of
the
rules
under
rule
52
as
plain
error,
but
it
is,
i
am
treating
it
as
separate
categories.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
can't
think
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--a
case
that
this
court
has
decided
in
which
it
has
held
that
there
is
plain
error
which
is
not
harmful,
because
the
way
we
read
the
language
of
rule
52,
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
way
this
court
has
done
so
in
frady
and
in
young,
is
to
say
that
it
has
to
be
an
egregious
error
affecting
the
defendant's
substantial
rights.
now,
i
can
think
hypothetically
a
case
that
would,
i
think,
be
recognized
as
plain
error
even
though
it
might
not
specifically
prejudice
the
defendant,
and
that
is
if
something
really
absurd
happened
at
a
trial,
something
that
just
wouldn't
happen,
but
hypothetically
you
could
say
if
the
judge
stepped
off
the
bench
and
said
i'm
going
to
let
my
4-year-old
granddaughter
sit
on
the
bench
now
and
rule
on
objections,
because
i
think
it
would
be
cute
and
i'd
like
to
get
a
picture
of
it.
i
mean,
i'm
reaching
very
far.
but
you
could,
in
that
case
i
think
the
reputation
of
the
public
proceedings,
of
judicial
proceedings
in
the
public's
eye,
would
be
impaired
to
an
extent
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
judgment
cannot
stand.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right.
i
think
that's
right.
but
otherwise
you
have
to
show
prejudice
to
the
defendant
of
a
substantial
sort.
now,
the
second
area
and
the
one
in
which
petitioner
puts
his
most
reliance
is
this
notion
that
there
is
jurisdictional
error
and
that
it's
nonwaivable.
well,
again,
of
course
the
word
jurisdiction
is
a
murky
term,
but
i
think
what
the
court
has
said
in
this
area
is
that
jurisdiction,
when
there
is
jurisdictional
error
that
means
that
the
district
judge,
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
district
judge
does
not
have
authority
with
respect
to
a
particular
class
of
cases
to
enter
a
binding
judgment
with
respect
to
the
parties.
that
clearly
is
not
the
case
here.
here
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
subject
jurisdiction
in
this
case
in
the
district
court.
the
only
question
is
did
the
district
court
make
a
mistake
in
assigning
this
particular
part
of
the
case,
this
particular
function,
to
an
officer
of
the
court
who
should
not
have
had
that
assignment.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
jurisdiction
in
the
traditional
sense.
it's
a
question
of
authority
of
that
officer
and
the
permissibility
of
the
assignment.
for
that
reason
this
case,
in
our
view,
is
no
different
from
what
it
would
have
been
had
the
district
judge,
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
now,
had
the
district
judge
simply
said
i
want
to
assign
the
jury
selection
to
the
judge
in
the
chambers
next
door,
who
is
not
busy
right
now,
and
i
have
two
jury
trials
going.
the
parties
fail
to
raise
the
objection,
which
would
be,
i
think,
a
valid
objection
under
the
rule
that
this
does
not
constitute
a
proper
assignment,
and
that
would,
i
think,
be
clearly
waivable.
there
is
no
question,
in
our
view,
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
jurisdictional
defect
if
the
judge
from
the
chambers
next
door
came
in
and
selected
the
jury.
even
though,
of
course,
as
respondent...
or,
excuse
me,
petitioner
contends,
that
judge
would
be
viewing
all
of
the
prospective
jurors
and
wouldn't
have
whatever
advantages
there
might
accrue
to
the
judges,
the
trial
judge's
exposure
to
the
jury
during
that
period.
but
nonetheless,
that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
defect,
we
say.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
would
say,
we
would
say
the
same
thing.
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
compelled
by
the
answer
that
this
court
has
not
addressed
but
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
agreed,
i
think
12
circuits
have
addressed
the
question,
which
is
that
civil
cases
and
misdemeanor
trials,
which
are
authorized
to
be
assigned
to
magistrates
by
the
statute,
can
constitutionally
be
assigned
to
magistrates.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
find
a
distinction
in
article
iii
or
in
questions
of
jurisdiction
between
misdemeanors
and
felonies.
sure,
felonies
are
more
important
to
the
parties
typically
than
misdemeanors
and
often
than
civil
cases,
but
there
is
no
article
iii
basis
for
that
distinction.
and
we
think
there
is
no
basis
in
jurisdictional
concepts
for
that
distinction.
so,
yes,
we
would
say
that,
certainly
with
consent,
reference
to
a
magistrate
for
a
felony
trial
would
be
appropriate,
given
especially
all
of
the
protections
that
are
available
by
way
of
the
magistrate's
position
within
the
judicial
branch
as
an
inferior
officer.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
analysis.
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
absolutely
would
be
constitutionally
prohibited,
but
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
would
be
a
harder
argument.
and
i
think
each
of
the
lower
courts
that
has
addressed
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
and
misdemeanor
jurisdiction
has
relied
heavily
on
consent.
but
i
think
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
dead.
i
think
there
is
room
for
a
fair
constitutional
argument
that
it
could
be
done
without
consent,
just
as
in
raddatz--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
would
be
error
under
the
statute
as
it
now
exists,
certainly.
i
was
addressing--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
yeah,
absolutely.
under
gomez
i
think
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
certainly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
because
we
would
not
be
allowed
to
claim
that,
harmless
error
under
gomez.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
court--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
well,
i
think
that
the
reasoning--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
what
the
court
in
gomez
was
getting
at
is
saying
that
this
is
one
of
those
areas,
such
as
where
you
have
a
potentially
biased
fact-finder,
in
which
it
is
simply
impossible
to
make
a
fine
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
absolutely
no
prejudice.
therefore
we
will
not
allow
the
government
to
come
in
and
say,
ah
ha,
there
has
been
no
prejudice
in
this
case.
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
i
think
that's
very
different
from
the
inquiry
that
has
to
be
made
under
plain
error
doctrine.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
think
they're
contradictory,
your
honor.
i
think
they...
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
the
way
we
see
the
distinction.
we
say
that
what
gomez
said
was
that
the
additional
duties
clause
in
particular
of
the
magistrates
act
does
not
include
voir
dire.
now,
we
further
say
that
the
parties
agreeing
consent
does
not
make
it
so,
does
not
change
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
voir
dire
simply
isn't
included
within
the
additional
duties
that
the
statute
assigns.
but
that
is
very
different
from
saying
that
you
then
must
apply
plain
error
to
the
statutory
violation.
yes,
the
statute
is
violated,
but
no,
you
don't
automatically
get
relief
simply
by
virtue
of
a
violation
of
the
statute.
and
in
fact
we
think
there
will
be
very
few
cases
in
which
you
will
get
relief
if
you
don't
object.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
except
that
i
think
our
case
is
stronger,
because
it's
not
that
congress
said
you
may
not
assign
jury
selection
to
a
magistrate.
what
congress
simply
left
out
of
the
additional
duties
clause,
as
that
clause
was
construed
by
this
court
in
gomez,
the...
it
simply
failed
to
include
jury
selection.
now,
it
would
be
a
somewhat
different
case,
we
think,
if
congress
had
said,
number
one,
you
can
do
the
following
additional
duties
but
you'd
better
not
do
jury
selection.
you
may
not
do
jury
selection
in
misdemeanor
or
felony
cases.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
now,
i
think,
moving
on
to
the
article
iii
point,
there
we
rely
on
two
lines
of
cases.
first
those
cases
such
as
raddatz
and
crowell,
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
an
adjunct
to
a
district
court
can
perform
services
in
aid
of
the
district
judge
as
long
as
the
district
judge
maintains
control
of
the
proceedings,
as
long
as
the
essential
attributes
of
judicial
power
are
preserved
in
the
district
court.
now,
and
the
second
line
of
cases
is
a
case
illustrated
by
the
schor
case,
in
which
the
court
has
attached
great
weight
to
the
presence
of
consent
with
respect
to
the
waiver
of
the
individual
component
of
the
article
iii
right.
it's
important,
i
think,
in
focusing
on
the
article
iii
claim
to
see
just
exactly
what
it
is
we
have
here
with
respect
to
a
magistrate.
we
have
an
officer
who,
it
was
appointed
by
the
district
court,
who
is
removable
by
the
district
court,
who
is
supervised
in
everything
that
he
or
she
does
by
the
district
court,
who's
subject
to
the
district
court's
appointment
in
the
particular
case.
the
district
court
does
not
have,
by
law
or
practice
or
rule,
have
to
assign
the
magistrate
to
a
particular
case.
and
the
district
court
may
withdraw
from
the
magistrate
the
reference
at
any
time.
the
magistrate's
work,
moreover,
is
subject
to
whatever
degree
of
review
the
district
court
can
perform,
upon
the
party's
request,
if
they
should
request
it.
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
important
point,
in
this
particular
case
there
was
no
request
for
a
review,
and
there's
a
good
reason,
because
this
jury
selection
procedure
was
clean
as
a
whistle.
it's
not
surprising
that
there
was
no
request
for
review
because
frankly
there
was
nothing
to
review.
the
only
one
point
on
which
the
magistrate
ruled
against
the
defendant,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
by
excusing
someone
that
the
defendant
preferred
not
to
have
excused,
was
a
case
which,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
was
very
clearly
somebody
that
was
properly
challenged
for
cause.
and
the
defendant
didn't
come
to
the
district
court
and
say
your
honor,
this
juror
should
not
have
been
challenged
for
cause.
this
was,
there
was
no
basis
for
that.
he
acquiesced,
in
effect,
in
the
magistrate's
decision
with
respect
to
that
juror.
and
i
might
say,
there
were
something
like
eight
other
decisions
that
the
magistrate
made
which
went
against
the
government
and
in
favor
of
the
defense.
so
that
it's
not
surprising
that
the
defense,
number
one,
wanted
to
have
a
magistrate
select
the
jury.
the
defense
might
very
well
have
concluded
that
they
were
better
off
with
the
magistrate
than
they
would
have
been
with
a
district
judge,
who
might
have
been
a
little
less
patient
and
asked
a
few
fewer
questions.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
with
consent,
your
honor,
that's,
that
would
be
our
position.
and
i
think
that's
demonstrated
by
the
statutory
authorization
which
we
think
is
constitutional,
and
which--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--for
felony...
well,
that's
right.
the
statutory--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
that
gets
harder,
because
there
you
have
taken
a
very
important
ingredient
away
from
the
judicial
branch,
which
is...
from
the
article
iii
judges.
you
have
taken
from
the
article
iii
judges
the
complete
discretion
as
to
whether
to
assign
particular
cases
to
magistrates,
and
that,
i
think,
is
an
important
ingredient
of
separation
of
powers.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think...
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
that
the
decision
to
assign
in
a
particular
case
is
part
of
the
supervision.
it
demonstrates
how
much
control
the
district
judge
has
over
the
work
of
the
magistrate
and
how
much
control
the
district
court
retains
over
its
own
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
a
case,
in
other
words,
in
which
congress
can,
has
decided
that
district
judges
can't
be
trusted,
but
we
think
magistrates
as
a
group
are
more
favorably
disposed
to
the
kinds
of
outcomes
that
we're
looking
for.
therefore
we're
going
to
require
all
cases
to
be
heard
by
magistrates.
that
may
be
hypothetical,
but
that's
the
argument
that
would
be
made
to
attack
a
statute
that
didn't
permit
the
district
courts
to
assign
to
the
magistrates,
at
their
election,
those
cases
that
they
chose.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
the
statute...
i'm
not
sure
a
statute
that
required
that
they
be
sent,
that
all
cases
be
sent
to
magistrates
would
necessarily
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that.
but
i
think
that's
a
harder
constitutional
argument
than
the
constitutional
argument
that
would
be
faced
by
a
statute
that
permitted
it.
now,
the
language
that
you
propose,
i
think,
could
be
read
as
suggesting
that
there
ought,
the
district
court
has
to
have
some
good
cause
for
withholding
cases
from
the
magistrate.
but
assuming
that
the
district
court
is,
by
the
statute,
given
the
authority
to
choose
yea
or
nay,
then
i
think
that
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
has
found
in
the
raddatz
case
to
be
an
important
element
of
not
creating
a
violation
of
article
iii.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
supervision
and
having
a
substantial
responsibility
at
some
point
in
the
process,
whether
that's,
in
the
case
of
consent
whether
that's
a
case
of
review
of
the
judgment
that's
made
if
it's,
suppose
it's
a
misdemeanor
trial
conducted
by
the
magistrate,
review
of
the
judgment
by
the
district
court
in
the
case
of
consent
is
enough.
that's
certainly
what
congress
has
said,
and
we
think
that's
constitutional.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
what
we're
saying
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh
yes,
they
did.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
we
don't
really
want
you
to
draw
the
line,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
it
did.
it's
quite
clear
that
it
didn't.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
because
there's
a
difference
between
saying
that
congress
did
not
authorize
it
and
that
the
consequence
of
a
violation
of
what,
the
statute
that
congress
wrote,
is
that
there
absolutely
has
to
be
a
reversal
in
every
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
certainly,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's,
there's
no
doubt
that
that's
why
congress
chose
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
there's
no
difference
for
purposes
of
article
iii.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
real
world,
but
in
the
world
of
article
iii--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
but
there
is
nothing
in
article
iii,
we
submit,
that
draws
a
distinction.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
win,
we
submit,
still
because--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
say
that
the
magistrate,
there's
a
big
difference
between
the
magistrate's
trying
the
whole
felony
case
from
beginning
to
end
and
the
magistrate
simply
performing
one
limited
function
within
the
sphere
of
the
felony
case.
we
think
there
is
no--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
we
rely
on
supervision
both
in
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
gomez
questioned
whether--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
there
is
no
question
as
a
general
matter
the
court
in
gomez
said
this
was
going
to
be
something
that
would
be
difficult
to
do.
but
that's
a
general
matter.
let's
look
at
this
case,
and
as
i
have
tried
to
argue
here,
this
case
involves
what
happened
in
this
case,
because
we're
arguing
about
the
remedy
in
this
case.
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
problem
with
review.
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
review.
so
this
was
not
a
case
that
raised,
for
example,
batson
problems.
this
was
not
a
case
in
which,
for
example,
as
was
the
case
in
gomez,
the
magistrate
gave
a
long
instruction
to
the
jury
about
the
legal
principles
applicable
to
the
case.
the
judge
gave
that
instruction
in
this
case,
so
the
judge
was
the
judicial
officer
who
was
dealing
with
the
jury
on
questions--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
certainly
don't
object.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
wouldn't
be
enough
for
it
to
be
part
of
a
felony
trial,
i
think,
just
as
it
would
not
immediately
be
unconstitutional
or
contrary
to,
well,
unconstitutional,
for
a
magistrate,
for
example,
to
perform
other
services
in
the
context
of
a
felony
trial,
such
as
accepting
the
verdict,
or
even
were
the
district
judge
to
be
ill
during
the
time
that
the
instructions
had
to
be
given,
to
reading
the
district
judge's
instructions,
or
perform
other
services.
i
can
even
imagine
there
might
be
circumstances
in
which,
certainly
with
the
consent
of
the
parties,
the
district
court
had
been
called
away
for
an
emergency
and
the
magistrate
would
briefly
sit
as
a
presiding
officer
in
the
trial.
that
doesn't
withdraw,
there's
no
constitutional
magic
drop
dead
clause
that
makes
that
case
automatically
reversible
by
virtue
of
that
limited
participation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
with
consent,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
now,
it
is
true,
we
would
not
object
to
your
arguendo
accepting
the
proposition
that...
thank
you.
