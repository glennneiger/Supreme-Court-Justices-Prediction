justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
a
narcotics
offense.
at
a
pretrial
conference
attended
by
both
petitioner
and
his
counsel,
the
district
judge
asked
if
either
party
had
any
objection
to
picking
the
jury
before
a
magistrate.
petitioner's
counsel
responded
that
he
would
love
the
opportunity.
immediately
before
the
voir
dire
commenced,
the
magistrate
asked
again
if
the
parties
agreed
that
she
should
proceed
with
jury
selection.
petitioner's
counsel
once
again
gave
consent.
the
magistrate
then
supervised
the
jury
selection.
petitioner
did
not
ask
the
district
judge
to
review
any
decision
made
by
the
magistrate,
and
the
district
judge
officially
impaneled
the
jury.
petitioner
was
convicted
following
a
jury
trial.
the
federal
magistrates
act
authorizes
district
courts
to
assign
the
magistrate
certain
described
functions
as
well
as
such
additional
duties
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
gomez
against
united
states,
we
held
that
these
additional
duties
do
not
include
selection
of
a
jury
in
a
felony
trial
without
the
defendant's
consent.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
defendant's
consent
warrants
a
different
result.
the
second
circuit
held
that
it
does
ruling
that
the
defendant's
consent
waived
any
subsequent
challenge
to
the
magistrate's
authority
to
conduct
the
voir
dire.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
the
constitutional
concerns
that
led
us
in
gomez
to
conclude
that
the
act
does
not
authorize
a
magistrate
supervision
of
jury
selection
over
the
defendant's
objection
are
not
present
in
this
case.
absent
contemporaneous
objection
by
one
of
the
parties,
there
is
no
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
designation
to
a
magistrate
of
responsibility
for
presiding
over
felony
voir
dire.
because
the
defendant
consented
to
the
magistrate's
role,
we
also
need
not
be
concerned
that
we
are
depriving
a
defendant
of
an
important
right
or
privilege.
in
addition,
the
specified
duties
that
a
district
judge
may
delegate
to
a
magistrate
with
the
party's
consent
such
as
supervision
of
entire
civil
and
misdemeanor
trials
are
comparable
in
responsibility
and
importance
to
presiding
over
voir
dire
at
a
felony
trial.
permitting
a
magistrate
to
conduct
that
felony
voir
dire,
if
the
party's
consent
will
advance
the
policies
behind
the
magistrates
act
by
relieving
the
workload
of
district
judges
while
ensuring
that
criminal
defendants
have
the
ability
to
protect
their
interest
in
having
a
district
judge
preside
at
voir
dire.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
the
additional
duties
which
may
be
delegated
to
a
magistrate
include
supervision
of
voir
dire
in
a
felony
trial
provided
that
the
parties
consent.

marshall
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justices
white
and

have

justice
scalia
has
filed
a
separated
dissenting
opinion.
