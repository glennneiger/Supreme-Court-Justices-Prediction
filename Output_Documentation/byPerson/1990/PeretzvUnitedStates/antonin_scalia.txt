justice
scalia
but
in
order
to
make
this
case
parallel
to
that
you
would
have
to
establish
that
there
was
not
only
a
violation
of
the
statute
here,
but
a
violation
of
article
iii.
justice
scalia
and
so
far
all
you
have
said
is
that
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
requirements.
justice
scalia
it's
pursuant
to
a
statutory
scheme
that
violated
article
iii.
but
here
you
have
a
statutory
scheme
which
you
are
not
asserting
violates
article
iii,
or
you
haven't
asserted
it
so
far.
assuming
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
in
compliance
with
article
iii,
all
you
have
is
a
violation
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
not
comparable
to
what
was
the
problem
in
glidden.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
you
can
say
that
whenever
a
court
goes
beyond
what
the
statute
or
the
rules
permit
it
to
do.
i
mean,
in
a
sense
any
violation
of
laws
by
a
state
or
by
a
federal
executive
officer
or
a
judicial
officer,
in
a
sense
that,
in
the
broad
sense
you're
using
it
that's
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers,
whenever
you
don't
obey
congress
as
you
should.
right?
but,
i
mean,
in
that
sense
everything
is
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers
nothing
is
unlawful
unless
it
is.
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
that
sounds
very
reasonable
with
respect
to
everything
that
has
happened
in
the
past.
but
if
we
come
out
the
way
you
say,
the
same
thing
can
continue
to
happen
in
the
future,
can
it
not?
justice
scalia
and
the
congressional
desire
that
there
not
be
a
magistrate
for
these
things
can
simply
be
evaded
by
the
defendant
agreeing
to
have
a
magistrate.
justice
scalia
and
a
great
interest
in
using
its
magistrates.
justice
scalia
what's
to
be
disregarded?
i
mean,
there's
no
harm
done.
justice
scalia
volenti
non
fit
injuria,
right?
if
the
defendant
wants
it,
and
we
hold
the
way
you
say,
everything
is
fine.
there's
been
no
harm
done.
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
if
supervisory
authority
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
violation
of
article
iii,
then
i
presume
that
a
district
judge
can
let
the
magistrate
conduct
the
entire
trial,
so
long
as
he
supervises
it?
justice
scalia
for
felony
trials
as
well?
justice
scalia
so
congress
could...
and
if
the
court
can
do
it
on
its
own,
i
suppose
that
congress
can
require
the
court
to
do
it.
so
congress
could
pass
a
statute
requiring
that
all
felonies
be
tried
by
magistrate
subject
only
to
some
kind
of
judicial
review
by
the
district
court.
is
that
the
system
we
have?
justice
scalia
why?
i
don't
understand
why.
justice
scalia
if
supervision
is
enough,
you're
adopting
a
general
principle
that
supervision
is
enough.
if
it
is,
congress
can
say
we
don't...
you
know,
we're
having
more
and
more
federal
criminal
cases,
and
we
have
too
many
federal
judges.
magistrates
will
try
them
all,
federal
district
judges
will
be,
in
effect
they'll
just
supervise.
they'll
case
manage.
justice
scalia
that's
all
the
statute
has
to
say?
that
if
the
district
judge
wishes,
the
district
judge
may
try
the
case
himself
or
herself.
but
otherwise
all
felonies
must
be
tried
by
magistrates.
that's
all
the
statute
need
say,
and
it's
fine?
justice
scalia
so
all
the
constitution
really
contains
is
a
guarantee
that
you'll
have
a
federal
judge
supervising
your
criminal
trial
if
that's
all
he
thinks
is
necessary?
that's
all
that
all
that
sixth
amendment
and
all
that
good
stuff
says?
that's
all?
justice
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
only
cases
in
which
we
can
require
an
objection
to
be
made
are
cases
where
the
matter
would
be
waivable?
are
you
sure
that
that
comports
with
all
our
cases?
it
seems
to
me
a
very
sweeping
rule.
