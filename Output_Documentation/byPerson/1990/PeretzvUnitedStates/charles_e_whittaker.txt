justice
whittaker
mr.
rudin,
do
you
think
congress
could
have
expressly
authorized
the
use
of
magistrates
to
make
the
initial
voir
dire
of
jurors?
justice
whittaker
well,
do
you
think
since
the
ultimate
seating
of
the
jury
is
left
for
the
judge,
that
our
holding
in
raddatz
speaks
to
this
issue?
justice
whittaker
well,
you
could
make
the
same
argument
exactly
in
suppression
hearings,
and
a
magistrate
listening
to
the
testimony
in
the
suppression
hearing.
and
the
court
rejected
that.
so
i
don't
think
that
washes
at
all.
and
moreover,
in
jury
selection,
as
i
understand
it,
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
judge
to
make
the
final
jury
selection.
if
the
defendant's
counsel
has
objections
at
that
time
to
the
seating
of
any
juror,
they
could
be
asserted.
the
whole
thing
is
done
under
the
supervision,
in
effect,
of
the
district
court
judge.
i
just
don't
see
how
article
iii
would
prohibit
that
kind
of
a
scheme.
justice
whittaker
but
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
that
happens
when
a
magistrate
hears
testimony
it
witnesses
at
a
suppression
hearing.
and
whether
evidence
is
admitted
or
not
is
crucial
to
the
criminal
trial.
