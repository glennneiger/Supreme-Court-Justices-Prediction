how
is
it,
then,
that
a
magistrate
can
preside
over
a
misdemeanor
trial?
justice
jr.
but
the
court
has
held,
as
i
take
it,
that
a
misdemeanor
trial
can
be
presided
over
by
a
magistrate,
that's
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
power,
if
it
is
a
misdemeanor
trial
before
an
article
iii
court,
has
it
not?
justice
jr.
or
a
structural
violation
under
article
iii,
if
we
have
a
structural
violation.
justice
jr.
are
there
examples
of
nonstructural
errors,
the
kind
of
colloquy
you
were
having
with
justice
white,
in
the
case
law
of
cases
where
there
is
plain
error
but
that
is
not
harmful,
not
prejudicial?
justice
jr.
i
can't
think
of
any.
justice
jr.
shocks
the
conscience.
