89-1905,
wisconsin
public
intervenor
v.
ralph
mortier.
spectators
are
admonished
to
refrain
from
talking
while
you're
still
in
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
dawson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
didn't
one
of
the
wisconsin
state
courts
suggest
that
the
town's
ordinance
was
preempted
or
at
least
unauthorized
under
state
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
expressed
no
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
the
house
agriculture
committee
you're
referring
to,
mr.
dawson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dawson.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
argument
from
you
now,
mr.
kent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
by
that
mr.
kent
that
if
it
were
a
narrower
ordinance
it
might
not
be
preempted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
local
governments
in
your
view
are
left
some
authority...
are
granted
some
authority
by
fifra?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
committee
report
refer
to
the
particular
sub...
sections
and
subsections
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
indicating
that
it
was
those
particular
sections
or
subsections
which
did
preempt
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kent,
we
deal
with
any
number
of
preemption
cases
here,
as
you
know,
every
year.
and
ordinarily
if
it's
thought
that
there
is
no
preemption,
the
state
and
local
governments
are
left
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
you
say
they
should
not
be
left
in
here.
not
only
is
the
state
free
to
regulate,
but
if
state
law
allows,
the
local
unit
is
allowed
to
regulate.
so
that's
a
fairly
normal
consequence
of
a
finding
of
no
preemption.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
my
point
is
that
you're
saying
look
at
what
extravagant
things
might
be...
happen
if
the
various
localities
regulate
this
subject.
and
i'm
saying
that
possibility
is
opened
up
every
time
we
hold
that
there
is
no
preemption
by
the
federal
statute.
not
only
state
governments
can
regulate,
but
ordinarily
local
units
can
regulate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kent.
mr.
dawson,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dawson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-1905
wisconsin
public
intervenor
verus
mortier
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
