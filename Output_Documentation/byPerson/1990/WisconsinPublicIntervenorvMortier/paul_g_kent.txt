mr.
paul
g.
kent
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
circuit
court
of
washburn
county,
wisconsin
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
found
the
pesticide
regulation
enacted
by
the
town
of
casey
to
be
preempted
by
federal
law,
and
in
asking
this
court
to
uphold
these
state
court
decisions,
i
urge
this
court
to
consider
three
key
factors.
first,
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
fifra
demonstrate
a
clear
congressional
intent
to
preempt
local
regulation.
congress
expressly
considered
but
rejected
local
regulation.
second,
congress
created
a
federal/state
scheme
which
is
responsive
to
federal,
state,
and
local
needs.
and
it
did
so
because
congress
recognized
that
pesticide
regulation
is
more
than
simply
a
local
concern
and
must
be
subject
to
federal
and
state
control.
but
that
scheme
also
allowed...
also
allows
local
needs
to
be
addressed.
and
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
as
i
begin
this
morning
is
that
the
town
of
casey
ordinance,
the
ordinance
before
the
court,
is
an
extraordinarily
broad
ordinance.
it
creates
a
comprehensive
permitting
program
which
is
totally
independent
of
any
state
or
federal
program.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
could
see
that
if
the
ordinance
was
very
narrowly
drawn
there
may
be
some
areas
in
which
it
would
not
run
afoul
of
fifra,
but
that
would
be
very
limited
circumstances.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
as
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
one
area
would
be
is
if
it
falls
outside
of
the
preempted
field.
if
what
you
have
is
a
local
regulation
which
has
merely
an
incidental
impact
on
the
regulation
of
pesticides,
we
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
precluded.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
well,
in
our
view,
your
honor,
we
would...
we
believe--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--that's
true.
perhaps
you've
misunderstood
my...
or
i
didn't
articulate
clearly
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice...
and
that
is
if
there
is
an
area
where
the
local
units
of
governments
are
regulating
and
it
has
a
totally
incidental
impact
on
pesticide
regulation,
that
might
be
permitted.
i
think
the
example
i
gave
in
the
brief
was
when
a
town
rezones
an
area
from
a
commercial
district
to
an
agricultural
district,
there
will
be
an
impact
on
pesticide
use
and
regulation
by
simply
the
fact
that
the
use
is
going
to
be
changed
for
that
area.
but
that's
a
very
incidental
impact
on
pesticide
regulation
and
it
would
fall
outside
of
the
preempted
field.
i
think
to
get
back
to
the
casey
ordinance,
what's
important
to
realize
is
that
if
this
ordinance
is
not
preempted
by
or
in
conflict
with
federal
law,
then
few
is
any
local
ordinances
would
be
preempted.
and
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
local
units
of
government
across
the
country
would
be
free
to
enact
almost
any
kind
of
pesticide
regulation.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
we
believe
that
the
casey
ordinance
is
in
conflict
because
it
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
accomplishing
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
fifra
and
frustrates
the
federal
scheme.
we
believe
that
it's
in
conflict
in
several
significant
effects.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
do
not...
it
would
not
under
a
field
preemption
analysis,
but
possibly--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--on...
under
a
conflict
analysis,
it
could
pose
those
types
of
problems.
if
i
could
explain,
i
think
that
if
we
had
a
situation
where
the
state
of
wisconsin
authorized
every
local
unit
of
government
to
enact
its
own
pesticide
ordinance,
you
could
have
sufficient
lack
of
coordination
that
if
could
well
be
in
conflict
with
the
fifra
scheme.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
under
a
field
preemption
analysis,
we
believe
the
states
under
fifra
do
have
the
authority
to
regulate
this.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
not,
your
honor,
if
it
was
enacted
on
a
statewide
basis.
if,
for
example,
what
we
had
was
a
scheme
such
as
that
enacted
by
the
state
of
california
where
you
have
local
units
of
government,
in
that
case
the
county
agriculture
commission,
that
can
do
certain
things,
but
subject
to
state
review
and
state
supervision.
that
would
not
be
a
problem.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
the
problem
with
it
being--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--that's--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--yes,
your
honor,
the...
we
would
object
to
the
local
regulations
for
the
reason
that
you
do
not
have
the
type
of
coordination
that
you
get
on
a
statewide
level.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
it
would
be
permitted
within
the...
again,
under
a
field
preemption
analysis,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--no,
i
believe
that
looking
back,
your
honor,
at
the
way
the
statute
was
defined
and
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
local
regulation
of
pesticides.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
yes,
a
state
may
regulate
on
less
than
a
statewide
basis.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
think
there
comes
a
point
at
which
there
very
well
could
be
a
conflict.
i
don't
think
it's
approached
at
this--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--i--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
it's
impossible.
and
in
fact,
wisconsin
uses
that
scheme
very
effectively.
it,
for
example,
allows
different
restrictions
with
respect
to
aldicarb
and
some
other
pesticides
throughout
the
state.
my
only
concern
with
your
question
is
that
if
wisconsin
simply
had
a
blanket
delegation
to
local
units
of
government
which
said
enact
any
kind
of
pesticide
ordinance
you
like
and
it's
okay
with
us.
i
could
see
under
that
circumstance
you
could
have
a
conflict
with
fifra.
but
under
this
scheme
i
do
not
believe
such
a
conflict
would
arise.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
right,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
preempted,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
highlight
a
few
portions
of
both
the
statutory
language
and
legislative
history,
because
i
believe
that
what
is
important
in
looking
at
this
case
is
the
federal/state
scheme
which
congress
in
fact
enacted.
under
that
federal/state
scheme
only
states
may
regulate
pesticide
use
beyond
the
federal
government
and
that's
set
forth
in
section
136v(a).
and
congress
very
carefully
defined
the
term
fifra.
and
it
says
states
means
states
and
certain
territories
and
the
district
of
columbia.
it
doesn't
say
it
includes
political
subdivisions
or
it
didn't
even
say
that
the
term
"state"
includes
states,
leaving
it
open.
it
said
states
means
states.
we
believe
that
not
only
is
there
that
specific
statutory
definition,
but
that
that
is
underscored
by
the
intentional
differentiation
congress
made
throughout
fifra.
in
that
legislative
scheme,
states
may
do
a
number
of
things
other
than
regulate
pesticide
use.
they
may
issue
experimental
use
permits,
certify
pesticide
applicators,
obtain
exemptions
for
emergency
conditions,
and
exercise
primary
enforcement
authority.
political
subdivisions,
a
term
also
used
within
the
statute...
political
subdivisions
are
only
authorized
to
inspect
books
and
records,
cooperate
and
monitoring,
and
cooperating
in
carrying
out
the
chapter,
and
in
securing
the
uniformity
of
regulation.
to
allow
the
petitioners'
view
of
this
statute
to
stand,
this
court
would
first
have
to
conclude
that
congress
really
didn't
mean
what
it
said
when
it
defined
the
term
"states"...
that
then
congress
really
didn't
mean
what
it
meant
when
it
used
the
term
"state"
and
"political
subdivision"
on
a
differential
basis.
and
it
is
only
when
one
disregards
those
key
elements
of
the
statute
that
you
can
reach
petitioners'
provision.
and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
really
does
violence
to
both
the
statutory
language
and
legislative
intent
here.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
yes.
i
believe
it
would,
particularly
when
one
construes,
not
only
the
definition,
but
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
term
"state"
in
some
places
and
then
used
the
term
"state"
and
"political
subdivision"
in
others.
there's
that
intentional
differentiation
which
i
think
underscores
that
the
definition--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--certainly,
there
are
cases
which
indicate
that
where
congress
intentionally
differentiates
between
terms
that
that
congressional...
that
that
indicates
congressional
intent
to
use
those
terms
differently.
i
don't...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
is
specific
to
this
type
of
scheme.
but
as
a
matter
of
basic--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--it
might
or
might
not.
it
depends
upon
the
context
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
in
some
cases,
one
can
either
find
that
in
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
or
draw
that
implication
in
other
cases.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
think
provided
that
those
actions
were
specifically
authorized
by
the
state
there
would
be
no
problem.
but
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
yes,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
really
done
so
here,
and
again,
i
think
it's
not...
in
this
particular
context,
it's
not
just
the
definition
of
the
term
fifra
which
draws
that
differentiation.
all
of
the
regulatory
authorities
directed
to
states.
and
it's
only
the
subservient
cooperative
roles
that
local,
political
subdivisions
can
exercise.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
then
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
is
important
in
this
case,
because
if
ever
there
was
a
case
where
there
was
clear
legislative
history,
i
believe
this
is
such
a
case.
first,
we
have
explicit
statements
from
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee,
and
i
quote,
"the
regulation
by
the
federal
government
and
the
50
states
should
be
sufficient
and
should
preempt
the
field.
"
unquote.
but
that
language
doesn't
occur
in
a
vacuum.
that
comes
out
of
a
debate
that
occurred
in
both
the
house
and
in
the
senate.
and
when
this
matter
was
before
the
house,
the
house
had
before
it
an
administration
proposal
which
included
in
what
latter
became
section
136v,
a
section
that
said
states
and
political
subdivisions.
that
language
was
deleted
by
the
house
agriculture
committee
when
they
concluded
regulation
by
the
federal
government
and
the
50
states
should
be
sufficient
and
should
preempt
the
field.
when
this
matter
went
over
to
the
senate,
the
same
issue
was
squarely
before
the
senate.
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
adopted
the
house
version
and
then
the
senate
commerce
committee
said,
well,
let's
take
a
look
at
putting
local
units
of
government
back
into
section
136v,
sub
(a).
and
the
result
of
that...
there
was
a...
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
explicitly
rejected
that
amendment.
the
compromise
committee
of
the
senate
that
looked
at
these
two
committees,
rejected
that.
and
then
ultimately
the
version
that
was
adopted
by
the
full
senate
was
the
version
that
was
proposed
by
the
agriculture
and
forestry
committee.
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
have
a
compromise
or
an
agreement
to
disagree
or
certainly
not
legislative
silence.
this
was
a
case
where
kind
was
specifically
addressed
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today...
should
we
include
local
units
of
government
in
allowing
regulations
beyond
fifra,
and
congress
resolved
that
question
by
saying
no.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
subsection
136v.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
v
sub
(a)...
v
sub
(a).
mr.
paul
g.
kent
so
that
at
this
point,
one
not
only
has
to
disregard
the
statutory
language...
the
definition,
the
differentiation,
but
one
also
has
to
disregard
the
fact
that
congress
expressly
considered
this
question
and
rejected
petitioners'
view
point.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
yes,
i
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
it
was
referring
to
the
text
of
the
bill,
which
would
be
24(a)
and
24(b).
mr.
paul
g.
kent
right,
that
was
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
in
particular.
and
what
the
senate
commerce
committee
attempted
to
do
was
to
amend
that
section
by
including
political
subdivisions.
and
that
amendment
was
rejected
first
by
the
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
and
then
ultimately
their
view
prevailed
in
the
senate.
i
would
like
to
just
touch
briefly
on
my
second
point,
which
is
that
the
federal/state
scheme
which
congress
enacted
here
balances
both
federal,
state,
and
local
concerns.
my
first
point
here
is--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--sure.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
if
you--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--has
the
state
authorized
it?
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i...
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
believe
that
would
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
our
argument.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
we
believe
so,
your
honor.
to
turn
to
two
of
the
related
problems
that
would
result
in
allowing
local
units
of
government
to
have
unfettered
decision
making
in
this
area,
we
cited
a
number
of
them
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
just
highlight
two.
one
is
what
i've
referred
to
as
the
so-called
gypsy
moth
problem.
if
you
have
local
units
of
government
which
can
restrict
pesticides
in
their
area,
they
would
then
be
able
to
allow
a
noxious
pest
to
grow
and
develop,
and
then
spread
onto
neighboring
jurisdictions.
at
that
point,
the
neighboring
jurisdictions
not
only
have
to
use
more
pesticides,
but
the
pest
is
spread
over
a
larger
area.
so
that--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--if
i
understand
your
point,
your
honor,
the...
your
point
is
that
if
the
states
are
preempted
that
the--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--that's
true,
your
honor.
but
i
would
submit
that
this
is
a
particularly
problematic
area
in
the
pesticide
area,
because
if
a
local
unit
of
government
is
allowed
to
restrict
pesticides
in
its
jurisdiction,
that
problem
isn't
simply
transferred
in
the
same
form
to
a
neighboring
jurisdiction.
it
can
be
transferred
in
a
way
that
makes
the
problem
worse...
that
the
pests
grow...
that
you
have
a
larger
area
over
which
to
control
the
pests
and
the
use
of
more
pesticides.
so
it's
actually
exacerbating
the
problem.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
the
state
administrator
could
if
it
was
a
problem
of
significant
enough
statewide--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--in
a...
i
use
that
example
simply
to
illustrate
the
general
problem.
and
i
would
agree
that
in
a
statewide
emergency,
the
state
would
have
the
authority
to
come
in
and
take
care
of
that
problem.
but
where
the
situation
is
perhaps
even
more
problematic
is
where
you
don't
have
a
statewide
problem,
but
you
have
a
problem
that's
a
much
more
regional
or
localized
problem.
you
have
a
small
farm
that
happens
to
cross
two
jurisdictions,
and
in
one
jurisdiction
he's
precluded
from
using
a
certain
pesticide
to
control,
say,
a
certain
leaf
hopper
or
mite
or
something
that's
destroying
his
crop.
that
then
gets...
that
then
transfers
to
the
neighboring--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--yes,
but
i
think
that
the...
i
would
agree
with
that
as
a
general
proposition.
my
point
is
that
the
harm
actually
intensifies
as
it
spreads,
because
instead
of
having
that
same
problem
in
the
neighboring
jurisdictions
of
some
overspray
and
drift,
what
you
have
is
the
growth
of
the
pest
and
a
larger
problem
than
you
had
originally.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
for
this
reason
that
the
statutory
scheme
and
as
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
here
means
that
it
is
the
state
which
must
be
the
ultimate
regulatory
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
local
units
of
government
can
participate
in
administering
and
enforcing
a
state
program.
so,
for
example,
if--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--that
is
correct.
there
would
have
to
be
continuing
state
jurisdiction
and
supervision.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
would
see
that
in
two
respects,
your
honor.
the
first
is
the
type
of
cooperation
that
might
come
up
in
the
context
of
where
the
state
decides
to
regulate
a
pesticide
with
respect
to
a
particular
local
area,
as
wisconsin
does,
for
example,
in
saying
in
certain
counties
we
have
additional
restrictions
on
the
pesticide
aldicarb.
there
you
would
want
to
have
some
contact
and
cooperate
with
the
local
officials
in,
you
know,
setting
up
the
monitoring
and
in
administering
that
program.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
i
think
another
way
of
looking
at
it
would
be
the
california
model.
the
california
model
says,
we
will
allow
local
units
of
government
to
do
certain
things,
and
there's
a
specific
delegation
to
those
local
units
of
government,
but
the
state
retains
control.
a
decision
by,
for
example,
the
county
agricultural
commissioner
to
issue
a
special
use
permit
in
california
is
subject
to
specific
review
by
the
state
in
the
state
administrative
procedure
act.
under
the
california
scheme
if
a
local
unit
of
government
proposes
a
specific
regulation
for
its
area,
the
state
will
allow
that
to
happen
provided
there
is
an
express
approval
by
the
state.
now,
that
type
of
a
scheme
really
allows
the
purposes
of
fifra
to
be
served,
because
it
brings
to
that
scheme
not
only
the
state
expertise
but
the
type
of
coordination
that
you
would
have
on
a
statewide
level.
and
it
really...
it
serves
to
provide
a
statewide
perspective
so
that
some
of
the
most
parochial
problems
can
be
then
vetoed
by
the
state
effectively.
so
it's
that
state
control
which
we
think
is
key
here,
and
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
as
it
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
i
would
like
to
highlight
again
and
perhaps
clarify
some
of
our
earlier
comments
with
respect
to
the
conflict
issue
here.
and
i
believe
that
the
conflict
that
we're
talking
about
with
respect
to
this
ordinance
is
not
necessarily...
although
it
could
be
an
impossibility-type
conflict
where
the
federal
government
says
x
and
the
local
unit
of
government
is
saying
y.
our
concern
with
this
type
of
ordinance
is
much
more
in
that
it
frustrates
the
federal
scheme
in
several
respects.
the
federal
scheme
was
designed
to
provide
coordination
and
cooperation.
this
ordinance,
which
requires...
which
establishes
an
independent
regulatory
scheme,
operates
wholly
outside
of
any
state
program.
if
this
particular
ordinance
was
allowed
to
stand,
local
units
of
government
would
be
free
to
enact
whatever
they
want,
and
the
goal
of
coordination
would
be
lost.
second,
i
think
that
this
type
of
ordinance
presents
the
same
type
of
problems
with
effective
use
of
pesticides
that
we've
talked
about
earlier.
there
is
a
problem
of
parochialization,
that
the
local
units
of
government
concerned
with
their
own
narrow
interests
may
inadvertently
be
ignoring
the
larger
state
or
regional
interests.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
having
this
type
of
ordinance
by
a
unit
of
government
with
the
least
technical
resources
we
believe
thwarts
the
congressional
purpose
that
there
by
effective
pesticide
regulation
managed
by
those
units
of
government
which
can
bring
the
effective
and
efficient
regulation
of
pesticides
to
bear,
to
have
the
technical
resources
to
do
that.
that
if
this
ordinance
is
allowed
to
stand,
where
the
conflict
arises,
then,
is
in
a
case
where
you
then
have
the
burgeoning
of
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
these
types
of
local
ordinances
where
you
would
have
one
jurisdiction
requiring
a
permit
for
60
days
prior
to
use,
as
the
town
of
casey
has
done
here.
then
in
the
next
township,
6
miles
down
the
road
there's
not
a
permitting
scheme,
but
there
is
a
very
elaborate
notice
and
posting
scheme.
and
then
the
next
6
miles
down
the
road,
you
have
another
type
of
ordinance
that,
say,
perhaps
requires
a
review
of
the
pesticide
re-registration
process
or
something
on
that
order.
congress
among
other
things
in
its
concern
with
coordination,
was
also
concerned
about
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
many
of
the
amicus
parties
which
have
filed
briefs
here
today
have
highlighted
those.
and
to
just
give
you
one
example
of
where
that
could
be
a
problem,
i
would
submit
the
utility
rights
of
way
or
rail
corridor
problem
is
an
excellent
example.
a
railroad
or
a
rural
electric
cooperative
in
northern
wisconsin
which
crosses
several
hundred
miles
would
have
to
submit
to
regulations...
a
different
set
of
regulations
every
6
miles
as
it
goes
across
the
state
under
this
type
of
ordinance.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
kent
there
is
a
regulation
under
the
wisconsin
administrative
code,
ag
29.
there
are
certain
restrictions
on
spraying,
and
in
fact,
there
are
certain
limited
advanced
notice
provisions
as
part
of
that
state--
mr.
paul
g.
kent
--right,
considerably
more
restrictive.
and
again
our
concern
here
ultimately
is
with
the
multiplicity
of
these
types
of
regulations
could
effectively
preclude
any
use
of
pesticides
by
these
governments.
in
concluding,
i
would
just
like
to
note
that
congressional
intent
we
believe
remains
the
ultimate
touchstone
here.
and
we
believe
congress
established
a
coordinated
federal
and
state
program.
and
it
provided
that
states
can
regulate
use
and
defines
states
to
preclude
local
governments.
it
underscored
the
different
roles
between
states
and
local
governments,
allowing
states
to
cooperate
and
participate
in
those
state
programs.
and
i
think
as
the
words
of
the
statute
say,
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
this
chapter,
they
can
assist
in
a
state
program.
but
they
cannot
we
submit
under
this
statute
and
this
legislative
history
be
involved
in
a
case
where
they
can
do
so
wholly
independent
and
without
regard
to
the
state
program
or
the
federal
program.
