mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
local
units
of
government
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
continue
to
regulate
the
use
of
pesticides
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
and
environment
of
their
citizens,
as
they
have
been
doing
for
a
great
number
of
years,
and
certainly
since
the
congress
enacted
the
federal
insecticide,
fungicide
and
rodenticide
act
almost
20
years
ago.
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
is
did
congress
clearly
intend
to
preempt
local
governments
from
regulating
pesticides
when
it
enacted
fifra.
the
respondents
in
this
case
claim
that
local
governments
can
do
nothing,
that
they're
powerless
to
protect
their
citizens
from
pesticide
hazards.
they
claim
congress
intended
to
strip
local
governments
of
this
power,
which
includes
as
much
of
a
power
as
to
simply
require
the
posting
of
warning
signs
on
adjacent
properties
to
warn
citizens
to
stay
away
from
areas
that
have
been
treated
by
pesticides.
i'd
like
to
briefly--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--that's
true.
the
state
could
do
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
and
the
state
does
not
have
to
respond
affirmatively
to
such--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--i'd
like
to
briefly
review
the
ordinance.
first
the
ordinance
is
not
a
pesticide
registration
regulation.
it
does
not
seek
or
require
to
make
expert
scientific
decision
entailed
in
the
pesticides
registration
process
that
occurs
under
fifra.
second,
the
ordinance
applies
to
pesticide
spraying
of
public
lands,
private
lands
open
to
public
access,
and
aerial
applications
by
aircraft.
we're
talking
about
protecting
areas
frequented
by
people.
third,
the
ordinance
is
expressly
aimed
at
protecting
private
property,
drinking
water
wells,
and
other
areas
open
to
the
public,
like
lakes
and
streams,
hunting
grounds,
play
and
recreation
areas,
and
public
rights
of
way.
fourth,
the
town
of
casey
ordinance
is
a
permit
ordinance.
it
permits
pesticide
use
under
certain
circumstances
and
it
allows
the
town
board
to
impose
reasonable
conditions.
for
example,
it
can
prevent
spraying
under
windy
conditions
or
it
can
create
buffer
zones
around
play
areas
or
school
grounds
to
protect
children.
true,
permits
under
this
ordinance
may
be
denied,
but
only
after
consideration
of
such
things
as
the
benefits
of
the
pesticide
application,
available
alternatives,
and
negative
effects
of
denying
the
permit.
no
permit
has
been
denied
under
this
ordinance.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
there
could
be
some
overlap,
but
i
think
the
emphasis
here
is
that
this
ordinance,
and
ordinances
that
have
been
passed
like
it,
deal
with
things
that
fifra
does
not
do.
fifra
does
not
get
down
into
the
locality
and
dictate
or
provide
conditions...
protective
conditions
for
the
protection
of
streams
and
playgrounds.
these
are
the
things
that
people
at
the
local
level
understand.
things
that
people
in
washington
or
even
at
the
state
capital
are
not
going
to
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the
way
the
town
of
casey--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--that's
very
problematical,
because
the
state
may
not
permit...
i'm
sorry...
the
state
may
not--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--well,
in
this
case
the
state
has
given
the
town
of
casey
permission
to
pass
general
ordinances
under
the
police
power
to
protect
the
local
governments.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
if
it's
the
kind
of
power
that
is
the
power
that
their
exercising
now,
fine.
but
if
it's
the
time...
the
kind
of
regulation
being
suggested
by
respondents
that
the
town
is...
has
its
hands
tied
to
only
perform
that
which
the
state
is
going
to
do,
then
that's
going
to
be
very
serious
and
problematic.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
i
would
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
the
washburn
county
circuit
court
held
that.
however,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
did
not
deal
with
that
issue
and
only
dealt--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--simply
ruled
on
the
federal
question.
the
second
part
of
this
ordinance
is
the
posting
requirement.
it
simply
says
that
the
ordinance
allows
the
town
board
to
require
the
posting
of
signs
on
treated
lands
to
warn
citizens
of
the
areas
where
the
public
may
go
so
that
they
can
make
their
own
decisions
about
whether
or
not
to
be
exposed
to
those
kinds
of
chemicals.
fifra
really
doesn't
perform
these
kinds
of
functions,
nor
was
it
really
intended
to
do
that.
respondents
attack
the
entire
ordinance.
they
say
the
town
can
do
nothing
in
this
area.
the
place--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--if
i
understand--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--i'm
not
positive.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
if
i
understand--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--if
i
understand
your
question,
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes.
the
town
may
regulate...
it
is
free
to
regulate,
it
is
free
to
do
that
which
the
state
could
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
yes,
that's
correct.
24(a)
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--yes.
and
that
gets
us
to
the
act
itself.
i
think
the
best
place
to
start
with
looking
at
the
intent
of
congress
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
that's
section
24
of
fifra.
24(b)...
i'm
going
to
start
with
24(b),
because
that
is
the
express
preemption
provision
of
this
act,
and
it
only
preempts
state
regulation
with
regard
to
pesticide
labeling
and
packaging.
it
is
specific.
that
is
as
far
as
the
preemption
goes.
we
then
move
on
to
section
24(a)
which
is
the
anti-preemption
provision
of
the
act.
it's
ironic
that
respondents
depend
on
the
anti-preemption
provision
of
this
act
for
the
basis
of
their
argument
that
local
governments
are
indeed
preempted.
yet
this
act
says
that
the
state
may
regulate
the
sale
or
use
of
a
federally
registered
pesticide.
it
is
upon
this
express
language...
it
is
upon
the
history
of
this
language
that
respondents
go
to
to
make
the
argument
that
local
governments
are
preempted.
it
does
not
follow
that
because
states
are
authorized
to
regulate
that
local
governments
are
preempted
from
regulating.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
no.
i--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--except
that
in
this
case
we
have
24(b)
which
is
a
specific
preemption
provision.
i
assume
your
question
assumes
that
24(b)
is
still
here?
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
in
light
of
the
congress
specifically
dealing
with
preemption
and
going
only
this
far
that
the
states
are
free
to
distribute
their
power
to
their
local
governments,
to
allow
their
local
governments
to
continue
to
regulate
in
this
field,
that
they
in
fact
are
not
preempted.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
it
is
136(v).
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
section...
i
might
also
point
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--casey,
wisconsin,
is
a
northwestern
wisconsin
town--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--it's
in
washburn
county,
wisconsin.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
it's
near
spooner.
it's
just
above
spooner
about
30
miles
above
spooner.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
on
the
road
to
superior.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
there
are
approximately
400
to
500
citizens
that
live
in
the
town
of
casey.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
large
enough
to
be
authorized
by
the
state
legislature
to
pass
the
ordinance,
yes.
there
are
other
provisions
in
fifra
that
also
suggest
that
congress
contemplated
that
there
would
be
local
regulation.
in
particular,
i
point
to
section
22,
which
is
7
u.s.c.
136
(t)
of
the
act.
this
act
requires
the
epa
administrator
to
cooperate
with
local
units
of
government
in
securing
uniformity
of
regulations.
this
suggests
that
local
governments
are
contemplated
to
have
the
authority
to
regulate
pesticides
for
which
the
epa
should
seek
uniformity
through
cooperation
not
through
preemption.
respondents
rest
their
case
heavily
on
the
legislative
history
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
the
state
supreme
court
held
in
a
4-3
decision
that
the
federal
law
preempts
local
governments
from
regulating
pesticides.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
that's
correct.
there
appears
to
be
no
official
position.
going
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
we
started
in
the
house.
it's
true
that
the
agriculture
committee
voted
not
to
authorize
local
regulation
and
that
it's
intent
was
to
preempt.
however,
this
act,
this
intention,
this
desire
by
one
legislative
committee
does
not
translate
to
an
affirmative
act
by
the
full
house
to
preempt
local
regulation.
also,
on
the
house
floor--
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
--yes,
it
is.
excuse
me.
the
house
debated
on
the
floor
also
when
the
bill
was...
went
to
the
floor
an
amendment
to
senate
2
of
section
24(a),
which
is
the
preemption...
the
anti-preemption
provision,
state
regulation
of
general
use
pesticides.
but
again
it
did
not
really
address
the
local
regulation
of
pesticides.
over
on
the
house
side...
i'm
sorry...
on
the
senate
side,
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
did
intend
to
preempt
local
regulation
by
not
authorizing
local
regulation.
the
senate
commerce
committee,
however,
differed
with
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
and
they
did
not
wish
to
preempt
local
governments.
and
it
never
really
disavowed...
never
did
disavow
its
view
that
fifra
should
not
preempt
local
regulation.
again,
the
language
of
the
act
is
what
the
full
congress
voted
on.
the
act
also
had
to
go
to
conference
committee.
there
was
not
complete
agreement
on
the
two
bills
coming
out
of
the
house
and
the
senate.
and
the
house
and
the
senate
conference
committee
did
not
address
or
resolve
the
dispute
over
the
issue
of
local
preemption.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
that
statement
has
been
given
different
significance
by
different
courts.
that
was
i
believe
senator
allen,
the
chairman
of
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committee,
who
stated
the
view
of
the
agriculture
and
forestry
committee
that
local
governments
should
be
considered
to
be
preempted.
however,
this
by
itself
does
not
establish...
the
full
senate
adopted
that
view.
simply
because
a
senator
placed
that
in
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
the
full
senate
agreed
with
that
view.
and
therefore,
there
is
not
a
clear
intent
on
behalf
of
the
congress
to
preempt.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
dawson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
a
question
that
justice
souter
raised
regarding
senator
allen's
activity
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
and
i
may
have
misspoke.
i
want
to
refer
the
court
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
on
page
20
in
which
it
makes
very
clear
exactly
what
happened.
there
senator
allen
inserted
an
explanation
of
the
bill
as
it
appeared
in
the
original
report
of
the
committee
of
agriculture
and
forestry,
which
included
that
paragraph
concerning
the
authority
of
local
governments
from
the
initial
report.
thus,
he
did
not
read
it
into
the
record
while
on
the
senate
floor.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
senate...
the
dispute
that
existed
between
the
senate
agriculture
and
forestry
committees
as
well
as
the
commerce
committee
was
never
resolved.
that
dispute
was
never
resolved
in
the
passage
of
this
act.
this
act
went
to
a
conference--
