justice
souter
are
you...
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
comment
specifically
on
the
excerpt
from
legislative
history
that's
referred
to
on
page
23
of
the
opposing
counsel's
brief
where
they
point
out
that
one
senator
inserted
in
the
congressional
record
a
statement
prior
to
the
vote
that
the
amendments
should
be
understood
as
depriving
local
authorities
or
political
subdivisions
of
jurisdiction.
is
that
significant?
justice
souter
was
there
any
opposing
statement
submitted
into
the
record
at
that
point?
justice
souter

to
make

it.
the

on
page
23,
as

understand
what

just
told

was
a
statement
specifically
referring
to
what
is
now
subsection
