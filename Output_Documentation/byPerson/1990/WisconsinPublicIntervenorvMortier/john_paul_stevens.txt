mr.
wallace,
in
that
connection,
if
the
epa
prescribes
a
regulation...
i
mean
a
labelling
deciding...
describing
how
a
pesticide
can
be
used
safely,
is
there
any
violation
of
federal
law
if
a
person
using
the
pesticide
chooses
not
to
follow
the
instructions?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
my
question
is
whether...
if
a
person
goes
beyond,
uses
it
in
a
way
which
would
violate
the
labelling
instructions,
is
that
person
who
uses
the
pesticide
subject
to
any
penalty
under
federal
law?
justice
stevens
because
it
seems
to
me
the
local
ordinance
here
is
focusing
on
the
user
rather
than
the
labeler,
whereas
the
federal
law
tends
to
focus
on
the
contents
of
the
label
and
descriptions
of
permitted
use.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
well,
you're
describing
one
that's
significant
to
adjoining
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
would
be
the
perfect
case
for
state
intervention.
in
fact
i
would
think
the
state
would
be
more
likely
to
intervene
than
the
federal
government.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
works
both
ways.
also,
if
you
allow
unrestricted
air
spraying,
you
can
affect
the
water
supply
that
can
go
into
the
next
county,
too.
i
think
that
either
use
or
non-use
can
cause
harm
to
neighboring
jurisdictions.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
supposing
wisconsin
passed
the
statute
that
said,
air
spray...
whether
or
not
spraying
by
air
shall
be
permitted
in
any
area
shall
be
determined
by
the
local
jurisdiction,
period.
then
would
that
allow
the
local
governments
then
to
regulate?
justice
stevens
and
that
regulatory
power
cannot
be
subdelegated
to
lessor
units
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
but
if
the
state
itself
isn't
supervising
the
program,
you'd
say
they
could
not
delegate
authority
to
individual
government
units.
justice
stevens
could
i
ask
you
then
if...
what
do
you
understand
of
the
provision
for
cooperation
where
they
do
specifically
refer
to
local
jurisdictions?
what
kind
of
cooperation
do
you
understand
that
to
be
referring
to?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
this
ordinance?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
other
regulation
of
aerial
spraying
in
wisconsin
other
than
ordinances
of
this
kind?
justice
stevens
but
this
is
more
restrictive
than
that
regulation
obviously?
