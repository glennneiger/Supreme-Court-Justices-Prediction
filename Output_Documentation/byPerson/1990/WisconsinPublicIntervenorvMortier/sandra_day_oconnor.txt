justice
o'connor
are
all
the
things
that
the
town
did
here
or
proposes
to
be
able
to
do,
things
that,
if
the
state
itself
were
to
do
it,
would
be
authorized
under
the
fifra
scheme?
justice
o'connor
do
you
understand
my
question?
justice
o'connor
is
everything
that
the
town
asserts
its
ordinance
permits
things
that
the
fifra
statute
would
allow
a
state
to
do
if
the
state
were
doing
it
at
the
state
level?
justice
o'connor
is
that
not
clear?
justice
o'connor
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way
then,
because
i
guess
you
didn't
understand.
i
must
not
have
made
it
clear.
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
statute
allows
certain
state
action
with
regard
to
the
regulation
of
pesticides.
isn't
that
so?
justice
o'connor
and
is
everything
that
you
argue
the
town
can
do
here
something
that
the
federal
law
permits?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
itself
adopted
the
exact
same
scheme
to
use
statewide
that
casey...
the
town
of
casey
adopted
here?
would
that
be
preempted
by
fifra?
justice
o'connor
but
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
much
of
a
conflict
with
the
purpose?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
boils
down
then
just
to
your
objection
that
whatever
acts
are
taken
are
taken
at
the
local
level.
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
otherwise
you're
being
very
inconsistent.
justice
o'connor
well,
counsel,
in
the
absence
of
any
legislative
history
of
the
type
found
here,
would
you
think
that
a
definition
of
the
term
fifra
would
normally
in
another
federal
statute
preclude
the
states
from
allowing
their
political
subdivisions
to
do
the
same
thing?
justice
o'connor
have
any
cases
of
this
court
or
the
courts
of
appeal
in
other
statutes
gone
off
on
that
rationale,
do
you
know?
justice
o'connor
and
you
don't
normally
think
that
state
action
includes
action
taken
by
local
political
subdivisions
that
are
authorized
by
states?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
a
little
hard
to
find
on
the
face
of
this
statute
that
the
term
"state"
couldn't
include
authorized
action
by
political
subdivisions.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
it's
not
a...
trying
to
tell
a
state
what
kind
of
law
it
has
to
pass
to
authorize
action.
wisconsin
may
pass
very
general
laws
that
allow
cities
to
take
action
of
this
kind.
