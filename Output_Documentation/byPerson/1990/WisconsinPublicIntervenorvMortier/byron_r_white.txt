justice
white
does
that
ordinance
regulate
the
same
things
that
fifra
does
or
the
state
does
under
its
authority?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
that
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
we
held
that
the
only
way
a
locality
or
a
town
or
a
county
could
act
on
its
own
would
be
if
the
state
permitted
it
to
do
so.
justice
white
well,
it
wouldn't
be
satisfied
to
condition
your
right...
to
condition
the
town's
authority
to
pass
this
ordinance
on...
the
state
giving
it
permission
to
do
so.
justice
white
well,
i
know
in
this
specific...
what
if
it
delegated
to
the
county
its
power
to
regulate
pesticides?
justice
white
so
you
would
not
be
satisfied
in
this?
justice
white
well,
mr.
wallace,
i
think...
could
you
just
briefly
say
what
powers
do
you
think
these
locals
are
entitled
to
exercise,
absent
any
express
delegation
from
the
state?
justice
white
i
know,
but
say
there's
no
delegation
from
the
state
at
all,
and
it's
the
state...
the
state
is
just
silent,
although
the
state
enjoys
the
powers
that
fifra
gives
it.
what
powers
do
the
locals
have,
independent
of
the
state
law?
justice
white
i
don't
suppose...
don't
you...
i
don't
suppose
a
local...
locality
could
regulate
pesticides
in
a
manner
that
the
state
itself
could
not
regulate.
justice
white
and
within
that
area
of
state
authority,
the
locals
can
do
the
same
thing
absent
some
restriction
imposed
by
the
state.
justice
white
fifra
doesn't
occupy
the
field?
it
doesn't
exhaust
the
universe
of
possible
pesticide
regulation?
justice
white
well,
if
it
did,
why
the
locals
couldn't
do
anything.
justice
white
well,
what
is
it
in
conflict
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
will
indicate,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
