mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pesticides,
even
if
federally
registered
and
economically
beneficial,
are
poisons.
and
it
is
no
small
matter
to
conclude
that
congress
decided
by
implication
comprehensively
to
preclude
local
units
of
government
from
any
regulation
of
the
use
of
these
poisons
in
the
community
in
order
to
protect
against
contamination
of
wellhead
and
other
drinking
waters
and
against
other
dangers
to
the
health
or
safety
of
persons
or
animals.
it
is
our
view
that
congress
did
not
make
that
determination,
even
though
some
members
of
congress
expressed
a
preference
for
that
result.
it
is
equally
our
view
that
nothing
in
fifra
precludes
a
state
as
a
matter
of
state
law
from
determining
that
local
governments
should
be
precluded
and
that
all
state
regulation
of
pesticides
should
be
centralized
in
a
state
agency,
or
as
california
prefers
in
the
brief
that
it
submitted,
joined
by
some
other
states,
that
local
units
be
enlisted
only
in
aiding
in
the
administration
of
state
laws.
fifra
leaves
that
determination
as
a
matter
of
state
law
up
to
the
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
addressed
that
briefly
in
a
concluding
footnote
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
this
court
has
not
addressed
the
subject
other
than
in
the
context
of
the
federal
expenditure
program
in
the
case
we
cite
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote,
lawrence
county
against
lead
deadwood
school
district,
in
which
the
court
held
that
state
law
was
preempted
by
a
federal
statute
which
specified
how
the
local
units
of
government
would
use
the
federal...
federally
supplied
funds.
i
don't
think
a
constitutional
question
need
be
reached
in
this
case.
we
have
addressed
it
very
briefly
in
that
footnote
and
pointed
out
that
it
really
does
rather
little
for
the
preservation
of
state
power
for
a
constitutional
holding
to
specify
that,
if
congress
determines
that
the
federal
program
will
not
work
properly
if
there's
a
multiplicity
of
local
regulation,
it
must
also
preclude
regulation
by
the
states
themselves
even
though
its
preference
would
be
to
allow
state
regulation.
that
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
serve
any
purpose
of
the
tenth
amendment.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
where
anyone
claims
that
this
kind
of
regulation
of
third
party
conduct
is
not
something
that
congress
could
exclude
the
states
and
local
government
from
altogether.
it
preempted--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
and
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
extent
of
delegation
from
the
state
is
entirely
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
fifra
itself
does
not
impose
any
limitation
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
on
whether
the
power
can
be
exercised
by
the
state
government
or
its
state
agency
or
by
a
local
unit
of
government
exercising
home
rule.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
i'm
speaking
only
of
regulating
the
use
of
pesticides.
the...
fifra
gives
very
broad
authority
to
the
states
to
restrict
the
use
of
pesticides.
with
respect
to
that
subject,
fifra
provides
a
floor
but
not
a
ceiling
on
restrictions
that
can
be
imposed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
this
is
our
view
under
fifra.
much
of
the
policy
argument
about
how
this
might
undermine
the
policies
of
fifra
overlooks
the
breadth
of
the
delegation
of
additional
state
authority
to
restrict
pesticide
use.
the
pertinent
statutory
provisions
appear
on
page
5
of
the
blue
brief,
petitioners'
merits
brief,
under
the
heading
authority
of
states,
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
these
are
sections
136v(a)
and
(b)
or
24(a)
and
(b),
as
one
my
prefer.
the
only
preemption
provision
is
(b),
which
says
that
no
state
shall
impose
additional
labelling
requirements.
we're
on
page
5
here.
if
we're
talking
about
negative
implications,
which
is
the
basis
on
which
a
preemption
claim
is
made
from
the
text,
ordinarily
the
negative
implication
would
be
that
unless
there
is
an
attempt
to
impose
labelling
requirements,
there
is
no
other
blanket
preemption.
there
may
be
conflict
preemption.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
rather
little
basis
in
what
epa
actually
undertakes
to
do
in
the
communities
to
support
that
argument.
the
epa
does
not
touch
upon
the
subject
of
posting
notices.
there
are
any
number
of
hypotheticals
that
could
be
raised
with
respect
to
protection
of
ground
water
sources
from
accumulated
runoffs.
epa
does
go
into
great
detail
about
tolerance
levels
left
on
food
stuffs
from
the
use
of
pesticides,
but
it
can't
as
a
practical
matter
undertake
a
determination
of
where
runoffs
will
go
and
how
they
will
accumulate
in
sources
of
drinking
water
in
particular
communities.
that
depends
so
much
on
how
widespread
the
use
of
the
pesticide
is
and
where
the
runoffs
will
accumulate.
those
are
matters
that
require
quite
specific
local
knowledge.
epa
does
not...
it
does
have
directions
on
the
labels
of
the
pesticides
so
that
those
applying
the
pesticides...
at
least
the
purchaser
and
if
the
applicator
has
the
original
label,
the
applicator
will
know
what
precautions
to
take.
but
this
doesn't
in
any
way
notify
other
persons
who
might
be
affected
by
the
use.
epa
does
not
address
the
question
of
whether
pesticide
application
in
a
child
care
facility
or
a
school
should
be
restricted
to
hours
when
the
children
are
not
present.
there
are
just
many
subjects
that
epa
does
not
address,
either
by
regulation
or
under
the
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the...
they're
authorized
for
use
only
in
accordance
with
the
label.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would...
i
don't
know
what
the
penalty
would
be.
i
just
haven't
looked
into
that
in
preparing
the
case.
it
definitely
would
be
something
not
authorized
under
the
federal--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
true.
that
is
true.
and
it
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
law
to
use
the
pesticide
for
a
use
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
label.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
label
requirements
are
to
define
the
permissible
uses,
but
the
states
have
carte
blanche
to
restrict
uses
beyond
that.
the
subsection
(a)
that
i
was
just
going
to
focus
our
attention
on
is
designed
for
that
purpose
and
the
pertinent
committee
reports
say
that
this
allows
additional
restriction
by
the
states.
and
there's
nothing
in
fifra
with
respect
to
pesticide
use
that
ordains
that
a
state
has
to
allow
the
use
of
any
pesticide
for
any
purpose.
a
state
could
adopt
a
measure
going
totally
organic
and
say
that
no
pesticide
henceforth
will
be
used
in
the
confines
of
this
state,
and
nothing
in
fifra
would
prevent
it.
and
if
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
doesn't
have
to
be.
but
in
many
states
they
choose
to
repose
that
authority
in
the
local
governments
and
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
not
addressed
in
the
kind
of
detail
that
the
safe
drinking
water
act
addresses
it,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
safe
drinking
water
act
of
1986
is
designed
to
deal
more
specifically
with
contamination
of
wellhead
water
and
other
public
drinking
waters.
and
that
contemplates
an
active
role
by
local
governments,
although
again
it
doesn't
require
the
states
to
repose
that
authority
in
the
local
governments
if
the
states
prefer
to
meet
their
obligations
otherwise.
but
that...
since
an
argument
of
preclusion
of
local
authority,
and
fifra
by
negative
implication
is
the
essence
of
an
argument
that
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
should
be
read
as
containing
a
negative
implication,
we
think
that
the
1986
act
can
appropriately
be
looked
at
under
the
standards
of
this
court's
recent
opinion
in
west
virginia
university
hospitals
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
congress
did
not
require
the
states
to
take
that
route.
states
vary
a
great
deal
in
the
extent
to
which
they
rely
on
home
rule
and
local
governments
to
perform
certain
functions.
but
traditionally,
local
governments
have
been
very
involved
in
the
protection
of
the
health
and
safety
of
the
community
on
questions
of
this
kind.
and
certainly--
