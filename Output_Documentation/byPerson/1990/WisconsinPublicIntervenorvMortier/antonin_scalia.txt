justice
scalia
mr.
dawson,
can...
just
so
i
understand,
there
is
nothing
in
the
position
of
the
court
below
that
would
prevent
a
state
upon
the
petition
of
a
particular
county,
for
example,
from
denominating
that
county
as
a
county
in
which
some
special
provisions
will
apply.
the
state
could
do
it.
it
doesn't...
the
state
does
not
always
have
to
act
statewide.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
well,
of
course.
justice
scalia
well,
that
depends
upon...
surely
that
depends
upon
whether
you
think
that
the
statute,
absent
any
references
to
states
or
municipalities,
would
have
preempted
the
states.
what
is
your
view
on
that?
suppose
none
of
the
sections
that
specifically
authorize
states
to
do
something
had
been
included.
would
this
be
the
type
of
a
statute
that
is
complete
enough
that
we
would
say
this
is
the
systemic
regulation
by
the
federal
government,
and
states
are
automatically
precluded?
justice
scalia
but
that
would
make
a
difference.
if
you
felt
the
other
way
on
that...
if
you
felt
that
it
were
that
complete
a
statute,
then
unless
there
were
specific
authorization
for
states
and
for
municipalities
they
would
be
precluded,
right?
justice
scalia
yes.
it
assumes
it's
still
there.
justice
scalia
i
wish
people
would
use
this...
what's
the
section
number
in
title
vii?
justice
scalia
136(b).
justice
scalia
mr.
dawson,
before
you
get
to
that--
justice
scalia
--did...
has
the
state
of
wisconsin
taken
a
position
on
this
matter?
some
states
have
come
in
on
your
side
and
some
states
have
come
in
on
the
other
side.
where
is
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
this?
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
the
executive
of
the
state
has
not
intervened
in
this
matter
or
filed
anything
as
an
amicus?
justice
scalia
certainly,
congress
can
give
powers
to
the
executive
branch
and
prevent
delegation
within
the
executive
branch
of
those
powers.
it
does
that
all
the
time.
certain
things
have
to
be
done
by
the
attorney
general.
certain
things
have
to
be
done
by
the
president.
so
if
that's
any
parallel,
it's
no
problem
to
do
the
same
with
respect
to
the
states.
justice
scalia
but
what
the
other
side
says,
mr.
wallace,
is
that
you're
reading
it
backwards...
that
is,
is
not
a
preemption
provision
at
all.
it's
a
permission
provision...
that
without
this
provision
the
act
is
so
complete
in
and
of
itself
that
we
would
have
held
the
states
cannot
enter
this
field.
the
federal
government
did
it
very
thoroughly,
has
all
sorts
of
provisions,
and
all
sale
and
use
of
pesticides
are
to
be
governed
by
the
federal
government.
so
this
is
not
a
preemption
provision.
it's
a
permission
provision.
it
says,
despite
what
would
normally
be
the
preemption
of
this
statute,
we're
going
to
allow
a
state
to
regulate
the
sale
or
use.
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
it's
quite
different,
and
the
negative
implication
is
just
the
opposite.
justice
scalia
why
does
this
run
off
problem
that
you
spoke
about
before...
why
would
that
have
to
be
handled
at
the
local
level?
justice
scalia
don't
the
fifra
statutory
provisions
or
regulations
prevent
the
use
of
certain
pesticides
where
they
would
be
likely
to
get
into
streams?
justice
scalia
you
can
argue
that
under
the
scheme
of
the
statute
you
really
need
local
regulation.
you
can
make
that
argument
in
fact,
because
it's
clear
that
the
states
can
prohibit
local
regulation.
justice
scalia
i
assume
you
would
also
say
justice
o'connor's...
you
responded
to
justice
o'connor's
question
by
saying
it
wouldn't
conflict
if
it
were
on
a
statewide
basis.
what
if
it
weren't
on
a
statewide
basis,
but
it
was
passed
by
the
state
legislature?
the
state
legislature
passes
a
law
saying
the
town
of
casey...
in
the
town
of
casey,
the
following
restrictions
on
pesticide
use
shall
apply.
and
it
adopts
similar
laws
for
other
counties.
they
submit...
they
just
pump
their
municipal
ordinances
through
the
state
legislature.
now,
that
would
clearly
be
permitted
under
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
field
preemption
is
trumped
by
the
provision
that
says
a
state
may
regulate
the
sale
or
use
of
any
federal...
i
mean
that
trumps
any
field
preemption,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
this
is
a
local
regulation.
it's
state
regulation
but
not
uniformly
throughout
the
state.
if
they
wanted
to
say
a
state
may
regulate
uniformly
throughout
the
state
the
sale
or
use
of
federally...
they
would
have
said
it.
they
didn't
say
that.
they
just
said
a
state
may
regulate.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
fight
this
so
hard,
because
some
of
us
might
think
it's
useful
to
be
able
to
have
different
types
regulation
in
various
areas
of
the
state.
justice
scalia
and
if
you're
telling
me
that
that's
impossible,
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
you're
helping
your
case.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
this
case.
that's
just
a
general
delegation
by
the
state.
that's
what
you
have
here...
this...
towns
can
enact
ordinances.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
scalia
i
suppose
that
if
state
throughout
this
whole
things
means
state
or
any
municipality
as
well,
then
a
provision
like...
oh,
gad,
there's
so
many
different
letters
here...
136b(f)
which
says
that
the
administrator
shall,
under
such
regulations,
authorize
any
state
to
issue
an
experimental
use
permit
for
a
pesticide.
i
suppose
that
would
apply
to
municipalities,
too.
then
he
can
authorize
municipalities
to
issue
experimental
use
permits.
justice
scalia
now,
has
he
done
that?
has
he
authorized
any--
justice
scalia
--no,
has
the
administrator?
justice
scalia
authorized
any
municipalities
to
issue
experimental
use
permits?
justice
scalia
but
he'd
be
able
to
do
that
if
state
means
both
the
capital
state
government
and
the
municipalities.
justice
scalia
it's
scary,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
why
can't
the
state
administrator
take
care
of
that
problem?
