justice
kennedy
large
enough
to
pass
the
ordinance
in
question.
justice
kennedy
have
we
ever
said
specifically
at
this
court
that
the
federal
government
can
direct
a
state
in
allocating
its
powers
to
its
political
subdivisions?
i
noticed
there
were
certain
statutes
cited
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
on
railroad
safety
and
right
to
work
laws
where
other
courts
have
said
that
this
is
an
appropriate
kind
of
preemption
to
find.
at
least
is
there
some
constitutional
concern
or
some
constitutional
constraints
about
the
federal
government
directing
the
allocation
of
powers
in
this
way?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
would
a
state
law
which
had
exactly
the
same
provisions
be
subject
to
the
same
invalidity
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
well,
under
this
statute
and
on
this
case?
