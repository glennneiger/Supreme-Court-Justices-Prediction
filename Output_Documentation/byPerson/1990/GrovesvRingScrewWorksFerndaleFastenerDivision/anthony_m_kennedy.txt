justice
kennedy
--well,
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
or
not
a
lawsuit
in
a
strike
could
proceed
concurrently?
if
there's
no
final
judgment
in
the
lawsuit,
can
you...
can
the
union
then
pursue
both
avenues
simultaneously?
justice
kennedy
can?
justice
kennedy
--the
evans
contract
in
that
respect
is
i
guess
somewhat
better
for
the
employer's
position
because
at
page
53
of
the
appendix
it
says,
unresolved
grievance,
except
arbitration
decisions,
shall
be
handled
as
is
set
forth
in
the
no-strike
clause.
justice
kennedy
and
if
there's
no
meeting
of
the
minds
as
some
general,
federal
common
law
of
the
work
place?
justice
kennedy
well,
no,
no.
justice
kennedy
this
is
at...
at
the
judicial
review
stage?
justice
kennedy
what...
what
is
the
substantive
law
to
which
the
congress...
to
which
the
court
looks
in
these
cases
where
the
contract
isn't
clear?
i
mean
you're
not
just
asking
us
in
this
case
to
determine
that
the
grievance
procedure
was
proper,
but
i
take
it
whether
or
not
there
was
just
cause
for
the
termination.
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
those...
that
was
in
the
context
of
arbitration.
justice
kennedy
and...
and
in
others,
fact
has
been
with
the
good
faith
duty
of
representation.
we
have
developed
no
real
federal
common
law
of
justice...
just
cause
for
discharge.
