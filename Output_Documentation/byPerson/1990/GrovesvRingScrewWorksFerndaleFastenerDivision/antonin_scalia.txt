justice
scalia
mr.
gold,
if
suit
is
brought,
do
you
consider
the
grievance,
by
reason
of
the
bringing
of
the
suit,
to
still
be
an
unresolved
grievance?
justice
scalia
when
does
the
no-strike
clause
allow
a
strike
to
occur?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
where
is
the
no-strike
clause
in--
justice
scalia
the
purpose
of
the
strike
being
to
force
the
company
to
do
what
the
law
may
permit
it
to
do,
what
it
may
have
a
contractual
right
to
do.
they
are
currently
litigating
whether...
whether
the
company
has
a
contractual
right
to
do
that.
justice
scalia
and
you're
saying
there
can
be
a
strike
to
prevent
the
company
from
doing
what
the
court
will
say
or
is
being
asked
to
say
it
has
a
contractual
right
to
do.
and
it
works
the
opposite
where,
you
know--
justice
scalia
--where...
where
there's
a
lockout.
the
employer
is
locking
out
the
union,
because
the
union
is
asserting
a
contractual
right
which
a
court
is
being
asked
to
affirm.
i...
i
find
something
inappropriate
about--
justice
scalia
mr.
gold,
is
this
an
unusual
form
of...
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
provision--
justice
scalia
--it
doesn't
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb.
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
what
is
the
more
standard...
what
is
the
more
common...
how
does
the
more
common
one
read?
justice
scalia
explicitly
eliminates--
justice
scalia
--judicial--
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
that...
that
brings
into
question
if...
if
everything
in
the
contract
is
not
enforceable
in
court
and
all
you've
agreed
to
is
to
go
to
arbitration
if
you
agree
to
go
to
arbitration,
and
if
you
don't
agree
to
arbitration
either
side
is
free
not
to
comply
with
the
contract,
the
union
to
strike
and
the
employer
to
lock
out.
how
can
you
call
this
a
contract?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
illusory
contract
if
it
is...
if
it
is
utterly
nonbinding
in
the
court.
now,
maybe
under
301
illusory
contracts
are
okay,
but
i'm
reluctant
to
interpret
the
provision
to,
you
know,
to
envision
something
that
is
unnoted
to
common
law.
you're
telling
me
this
agreement
says
nothing
except
we
agree
that
if
one
party
wants
to
go
to
arbitration,
we'll
go
to
arbitration.
but
if
the
other
one
doesn't
want
to,
we've
agreed
to
nothing.
that's
what
the
agreement
says.
justice
scalia
we
have
agreed
then
to
try
to
agree.
justice
scalia
but
if
we
can't
agree,
we've
agreed
to
nothing.
justice
scalia
i
think
that's
a
classic
illusory
contract.
justice
scalia
mr.
page,
here...
here
the
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
unions
filing
suit.
but
i
assume
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
issue
were
raised
not
by
the
unions
filing
suit,
but
by
the
unions
striking.
that
is
to
say
you
would
take
the
position
that
if
you
have
a
contract
which
provides
for
wages
of
$25
an
hour
and
the
union
says
we
think
that...
we
want
$30
an
hour,
you
would
then
go
through
the...
even
though
it
says
25,
they
say,
well,
25
means
30...
you
would
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
when
you
failed
to
agree,
you
say
the
union
would
be
free
to
strike
and
you
would
not
be
able
to
enjoin
that
strike
on
the
basis
that
it
was
in
violation
of
the
contract?
justice
scalia
so
the
contract
is
really
worthless.
justice
scalia
what's
the
use
of
having
the
contract?
justice
scalia
it's
the
same
result
that
would
exist
without
a
contract.
when
you
feel
like
striking
for
more
money,
you
strike
for
more
money.
justice
scalia
suppose
all
they
mean,
mr.
page,
by
the
provision
that
after
conclusion
of
the
grievance
procedure
they
may
strike
or
resort
to
lockout...
perhaps
all
they
mean
is
it
will
not
be...
it
will
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
them
to
do
it
even
if
they're
striking
for
an
issue
that
is
really
covered
by
the
contract.
i
mean
normally
if...
if
you
strike...
you
know,
the
contract
says
$15
and
you
say
it
means
18.
if
you
strike,
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
it's
already
covered.
maybe
this
provision
just
means
you're
free
to
strike
and
you
won't
be
liable.
however,
the
other
side
can
go
to
court
to
see
if
it
can
be
legally
resolved.
isn't
that
a
conceivable
interpretation
of
it?
justice
scalia
but
i
can
give
that
provision
meaning
without
leading
to
these...
what
seems
to
me
extraordinary
results
that
you
end
up
agreeing
on
nothing
to
all.
justice
scalia
just
agreeing
to
your
promise
to
negotiate.
