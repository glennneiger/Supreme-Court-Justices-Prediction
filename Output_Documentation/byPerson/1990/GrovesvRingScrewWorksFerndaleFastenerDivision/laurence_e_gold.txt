mr.
laurence
e.
gold
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
the
preceding
case,
is
one
in
which
the
international
union
uaw
is
the
petitioner,
but
thereafter
the
similarities
cease
rather
than
arising
under
title
vii.
this
case
arises
under
section
301
of...
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
as...
the
emptying
out
of
the
bar
section
shows...
raises
questions
of
somewhat
less
emotional...
proportion.
the
parties
here
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
a
3-year
term.
the
agreement
which
stretches
some
35
printed
pages
in
the
joint
appendix.
actually,
there
are
two
agreements,
but
they're--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--35
pages.
i
apologize.
[laughter]
35
pages
of
provisions
are
enough
3,500
and
our
printing
bill
would
have
kept
us
out
of
this
court.
stretches
some
35
pages
and
covers
the
normal...
particulars
of
the
relationship...
the
working
relationship
between
the
employer
and
his
employees.
the
agreement
contains
a
grievance
procedure
which
specifies
that...
it
is
the
method
for
treating
disagreements
as
to
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement.
the
grievance
procedure
provides
for
4
steps
of
conciliation
and
discussion,
provides
that
the
parties
may
agree
to
arbitration
for
certain
matters,
provides
that
an
agreement
reached
between
the
employer
and...
the
union
during
the
grievance
procedure
is
binding
and
is
silent
on
what
the
status
of
the
situation
is
in
the
event
that
the
parties
do
not
come
to
an
agreement
about
what
the
contract
means.
in
addition,
this
agreement
has
an
express
no-strike
clause.
and
the
express
no-strike
clause
contains
an
exception
for
a
strike
or
a
lockout
over
an
unresolved
grievance.
the
one
thing
that
is
absolutely
plain
is
that
the
agreement
is
totally
silent
on
whether
there
is
an
option
where
no
resolution
of
the
matter
is
reached
in
the
last
stage
of
the
grievance
procedure.
one
party
or
the
other
may
sue
under
section
301
which
provides
for
such
suits
for
breach
of
the
agreement
and
for
enforcement
of
the
agreement
as
properly
construed
and
entered
into.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i...
i
regard
it
as
being
an
unresolved
grievance
until
the
court
speaks
and
determines
whether
the
grievance
is
properly
grounded
in
the
contract
or
whether
the
employer's
action
was
consistent
with
the
contract
and
does
not
constitute
a
breach
of
the
contract.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
no-strike
clause
allows
a
strike
to
occur
at
the
completion
of
the
fourth
step.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
so,
it
does--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--look
at
the...
page
34,
the
no-strike
clause,
which
is
section
7
on
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
buff-colored
book
says,
until
all
negotiations,
there
shall
be
no
strikes,
et
cetera.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
section
7,
the
union
will
not
cause
or
permit
its
members
to
strike.
then
you
have
the
negatives
and
at
the
end
it
says
until
all
negotiations
have
failed
through
the
grievance
procedure
set
forth
herein.
neither
will
the
company
engage
in
any
lockout
until
the
same
grievance
procedure
has
been
carried
out.
so
as
we
would
see
those
words,
there
could
be
a
strike
or
a
lockout
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
stage
whether
or
not
there
was
a
lawsuit.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
to
the
extent
that
there
is
anything
inappropriate...
i
mean
your
sense
of
inappropriate...
this
is
not
in
the
lawsuit.
it
is
that
the
parties
created
both
an
option
to
strike
and
an
option
to
sue
at
the
same
time
rather
than
a
system
which
guarantees
that
you
will
have
only
one
or
the
other.
the
company's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
take
it
that
the
question
there
and
the
answer
that
we
would
suggest
as
well
is
the
same
as
was
assumed
in
buffalo
forge
in--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
think
the
strike...
we
think
that
a
continuation
of
a
strike
or
a
lock-out
after
the
judicial
decision
would
be
enjoinable.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
the
contract
says
nothing
on
that.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
what
if
it...
what
we
say
in
terms
of...
first
of
all
there
was
no
strike
here,
so
we're
not
dealing
with
the
question
in
this
particular
case
of
the
interplay
between
the
right
to
get
a
judicial
determination
on
the
meaning
of
the
contract
and
whether
the
contract
is
more
than
a
collection
of
words
which
have
no
purpose
when
the
push
comes
to
the
shove
and
whether
a
union
or
an
employer
can
go
down
both
options
at
the
same
time.
the
company's
position
here
is
that
this
silence...
the
creation
of
this
grievance
procedure
which
ends
at
a
certain
point
whether
or
not
there
is
a
resolution
of
the
disagreement
and
the
exception
to
the
no-strike
clause
which
permits
the
option
of
going
on
strike
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
that
the
parties
negated
judicial
enforcement
of
a
contract
whether
or
not
the
union
strikes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
let
me
treat
with
the
problem,
as
we
see
it,
because
it
explains
my
answer.
my
answer
is
that
we
believe
that
under
an
agreement
of
this
kind
they
can
proceed.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
concur.
and
let
me
state
why.
first
of
all,
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief
the
leading
lower
court
case
here
is
a
seventh
circuit
case,
associated
general
contractors.
as
that
case
shows,
you
can
have
one
party
bringing
the
lawsuit
and
the
other
party
using
economic
force...
the
defendant
using
economic
force.
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
that
case,
because
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
you
can
enjoin
the
nonsuing
party
from
using
economic
force.
and
against
that
background,
well,
we
don't
think
that
it's
hard
and
fast.
it
seems
to
us
it
would
be
unsymmetrical,
disproportionate,
and
unsound
to
say
that
the
suing
party
could
not
use
economic
force.
but
you
have
not
only
the
contract
questions
and
the
contract
interpretation
questions
here
but
you
also
have
the
norris-laguardia
act
questions,
which
as
the
court
noted
in
the
associated
general
contractors
case,
because
that
case
came
up
twice...
first
on
a
status
quo
injunction
pending
a
determination
by
the
court
and
a
second
time
around.
so
the
question
of
whether
the
use
of
force
is
a
breach
of
this
no-strike
clause
pending
judicial
determination
and
the
question
of
whether
it
is
enjoinable
even
if
it
is
a
breach
of
this
no-strike
clause
seems
to
us
to
be
separate
from
the
question
of
how
do
you
read
the
agreement.
do
you
read
the
agreement
of
permitting
the
parties
to
secure
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
was
the
salutary
effects
of
the
judicial
determination
of
the
meaning
of
the
contract
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
they
permitted
this
option
of
economic
force?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
is
a
minority
form
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
it
is,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
variation
of
your
risk
question.
i
can't
quantify--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
does
not
become...
10
percent...
it's
a
relatively--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--small
group--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--of
contracts,
but
it
is
not
sui
generis.
it's
not--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--extraordinary.
the
litigation
shows
that
there
are
a
fair
number
of
subjects.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
more
common
form
of
agreement
is,
or
most
common
form
of
agreement
is
one
that
provides
for
final
and
binding
arbitration
and
the
court
has
set
all
the
rules
on
what
that
means.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
both
eliminates
the
right
for
self-help
and
judicial
determination
of
the
meaning
of
the
agreement.
but
it
doesn't...
and
we'll
get
back
to
this
in
talking
about
what
the
policies
are
here...
the
important
thing
is
that
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
peaceful
on
the
merits
determination
of
what
the
contract
means.
it
provides
an
arbitral
determination
of
what
the
contract
means
in
the
traditional
sense
of
determining
what
a
group
words
that
constitute
legally
enforceable
promises
mean.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right,
and
in
addition,
it
is
fairer
to
save
than
rather
than
eliminating
judicial
enforcement.
the
steelworkers
trilogy
in
such
cases
set
a
standard
of
review
of
judicial
enforcement,
but
the
judicial
enforcement
is
the
final
step
in
the
process
that
either
party
will
not
accept
what
the
arbitrator
has
done.
the
arbitrator's
award
in
that
sense
is
not
self--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--very
narrow.
yes.
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying,
but
the
process
is
one
of
enforcement
of
contracts
in
the
way
that
any
common
law
lawyer
would
understand
the
concept.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
i
think
that
the
greatest
reason
for
doubting
the
inference
that
the
court
of
appeals
drew
is
the
one
you
just
stated.
i
think
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
concentration
here
on
arbitration
and
striking,
but
i
think
the
union
certainly
presumed
that
it
was
not
giving
away
its
right
to
go
to
court
because
it
is
extremely
difficult
given
the
disproportion
to
have
300
people
lose
their
sustaining
wages--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
i...
i
think
so
and
one
of
the...
one
of
the
important
functions
this
determine...
this
court's
ruling
will
have
is
to
give
the
ground
rules
against
which
the
parties
will
negotiate.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yeah,
and
the
question
there
is
why
are
these
two
contracts
which...
which
were
entered
into
by
the
same
parties
at
the
same
time
different?
what
did
that
mean?
the
court
of
appeals
points
out
that
this
case
was
litigated
on
the
basis
that
the
agreements
were
substantially
the
same.
the
employer
has
never
relied
on
that
as
showing
a
studied
determination
to
resolve
the
problem
and
it
does
have
the
phrase
unresolved
grievances.
how
you
resolve
grievances
is
as...
in
the
final
analysis
is
as
silent...
is
a
question
which
is
as...
totally
unaddressed,
in
the
evans
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
in
the
other
collective
bargaining
agreement.
having
taken
these
detours,
let
me
state
what
we
believe
the
right
rule
is.
we
believe
the
right
rule
is
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
should
not
be
construed
to
preclude
judicial
enforcement
unless
that
is
clearly
and
unmistakably
the
party's
intent.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
sound
rule
of
law
because
of...
of
the
language
policies
and
purposes
of
section
301
which
adds
a
provision
making
collective
bargaining
agreements
enforceable
in
court.
as
this
court
has
explained
those
purposes
and
policies...
most
particularly
in
lincoln
mills
which
we
set
out
the
basic
holding
of
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief...
as
the
court
said
there,
congress
point
was
that
unions
as
well
as
employees
should
be
bound
to
collective
bargaining
contracts.
there
was
also
a
broader
concern,
a
concern
with
a
procedure
for
making
such
agreements
enforceable
in
the
courts
by
either
party.
congress,
having
created
this
system
in
order
to
further
industrial
peace
by
making
these
labor
contracts
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts,
creating
quite
a
constitutional
ruckus
in
doing
so,
as
lincoln
mills
indicates,
it
seems
to
us
that
a
determination
that
the
parties
have
contracted
out
of
the
usual
processes
of
the
law
ought
to
be
one
that
is
clear
and
unmistakable.
and
we
believe
for
the
reasons
we
also
spell
out
in
the
brief
that
section
203(d)
which
recognizes
a
preference
for
final
adjustment
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
does
not
cut
back
on
section
201
at
all,
that
looking
at
the
totality
of
title
ii
of
the...
of
the
taft-hartley
act
the
obvious
purpose
is
to
further
peaceful
methods
of
settlement
of
the
whole
point
of
both
section
301
and
203(d)
and
title
ii
more
generally
was
to
create
a
system
in
which
there
are
periods
of
discord
when
the
parties
negotiate
agreements
and
to
encourage
and
further
systems
for
the
peaceful
resolution
of
contract
disputes
after
the
negotiation
is
concluded.
congress
did
not
prohibit
the
parties
from
saying
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
system
in
which
the
contract
is
not
enforceable
in
any
sense
that
one
would
understand
the
contract
being
enforceable,
namely
a
contract
being
a
set
of
promises
which
attempts
to
capture
the
future
and
where
disagreements
on
meaning
are
settled
by
referring
back
to
the
meeting
of
the
minds
as
reflected
in
the
agreement
at
the
time
it
was
entered
into--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--to
the
extent
that
the
parties
provide
for...
arbitration.
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--do
you
mean
as
to
what--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
it...
are
you
asking
about
the
substance
or
about
this
question
of
whether
the
contract
is
enforceable?
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
where
the
parties
don't
provide
for
arbitration
it
is
well
settled
that
the
court
interprets
the
contract
and
lincoln
mills
says
that
the
courts
must
fashion
the
law
they
apply,
the
contract
law
they
apply
from
the
policy
of
our
national
labor
laws.
again,
we
set
out
the
quote
at
page
9--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but...
it
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
there
would
not
be
a
federal
common
law
in
that
regard.
certainly
the
court
would
look
to
the
evolving
arbitral
law
on
what
just
cause
means,
what
that
provision
means.
but
it
is
perfectly
well
settled
in
sinclair
and
other
cases
that
the
parties
don't
have
to
provide
for
arbitration,
that
301
makes
these
contracts
enforceable,
and
that
the
contract
law,
which
after
all
is
a
relatively
passive
law...
the
basic
rule
is
that
you
apply
the
contract
as
the
parties
intended
it.
all
we're
saying
here
is
that
on
the
critical
question
of
enforceability
and
justiciability
there
ought
to
be
a
presumption
that
301
means
what
it
says
and
that
the
contract
is
enforceable
in
the
traditional
sense
and
that
only
if
the
parties
expressly
negate
that,
in
essence,
contract
out
of
the
system
which
congress
has
put
in
place
and
shown
a
preference
for,
should
the
determination
be
made
that
no
lawsuit
can
be
brought.
there--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
would
bring
cases
of
this
kind
into
federal
court.
but
i...
i
think
it
is
inherent
that
these
cases
will
be
in
the
federal
courts.
after
all...
unless
the
court
says
that
no
matter
what
the
true
intent
was,
if
you
don't
expressly
provide
for
judicial
enforcement
where
there's
no
arbitration,
then
you're
going
to
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis
what
this
clause
means
or
what
that
clause
means.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
will
be
cases
of
this
kind
in
federal
court
and
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--and
in
the
state
courts
and
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yeah,
and
that
congress
made
the
determination.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
a
lot
of
things
have
changed,
but
it
was
a
fighting
issue
in
1947
as
to
whether
these
contracts
ought
to
be
judicially
enforceable
or
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
system
where
there
were
simply
guidelines
which
the
parties
in
essence
could
tear
up
anytime
they
wished
to
do
so
if
they
felt
strongly
enough.
and
let
me
add
in
that
regard
that
in
no
sense
does
a
strike
system
constitute
a
method
of
enforcing
a
contract.
it
is
a
method
of
creating
a
new
contract.
the
parties
can
do
that
as
i
say,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
fitted
into
congress'
determination
to
have
contracts
enforceable
through
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.

yes,
absolutely.
mr.
laurence
e.

right.
and
we
believe--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes,
and
we
believe
that
the
lessons
of
301
in
particular
is
that
our
presumption
is
the
one
grounded
in
federal
law.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
absolutely.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
but
the
law
continues
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--to
say
that.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
in--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold

mr.

just
two
very
brief
points
if
i
could.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
emphasize
as
justice
stevens
just
indicated
that
this
is
a
question
of
interpretation.
the
whole
argument
on
the
other
side
is,
and
i
quote,
"the
parties
are
committed
to
the
process
they
agreed
on.
"
the
problem
is
that
it
isn't
plain
what
the
parties
agreed
on
and
against
that
background,
we're
suggesting
what
we
believe
is
the
better
interpretive
rule.
secondly,
the
policies
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
are
far
more
complex
than
simply
that
the
parties
can
do
whatever
they
want.
that
was
an
argument
that
the
unions
made
in
1947
and
it
might
have
been
a
better
world
if
we
prevailed,
but
we
did
not.
and
congress
provided
that
one
of
the
policies
was
stability
during
the
term
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
thank
you
very
much.
