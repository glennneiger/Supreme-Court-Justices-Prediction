chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
next
in
no.
89-1166,
international
union
v.
ring
screw
works.
mr.
gold,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
let's
have
order
in
the
court
and
no
talking
in
the
courtroom
except
from
counsel
at
the
lectern.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
are
literally
3,500
pages?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--where
is
that
on
the
page,
mr.
gold?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
isn't
there
also
a
right
of
judicial
review
of
the
arbitrary--
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
position,
mr.
gold,
would
certainly
bring
a
lot
more
cases
into...
labor
contractors
into
federal
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
page,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what...
what
is
the
reason
that
an
employer
or
a
union
would
prefer
this
kind
of
a
contract
to
a
contract
for
binding
arbitration?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
when
an
employer
enters
into
an
agreement
that
sets
forth,
you
know,
35
pages
and
signed
as
a
contract,
don't
both
parties
intend...
well,
unless
they
say
otherwise
there's
going
to
be
some
sort
of
right
of
judicial
enforcement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
is
your
answer
that
when
an
employer
and
a
union
enter
into
a
contract,
they
don't
intend
that
it
shall
be
or
that
anyone
shall
have
a
right
of
judicial
enforcement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no
and
then
explain
your
answer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
say
that
about
lots
of
contracts,
that
it's
just
the
contracting
parties
agreeing
on
the
rules
of
the
game,
whether
it's
a
construction
contract
or
the
way
a
particular
sports
league
shall
be
run
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
when
there
is
an
agreement,
ordinarily
people
assume
that
if
you're
not
able
to
solve
it
by...
to
settle
the
dispute,
one
party
can
go
to
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
company
refuses
to
go
through
the
grievance
steps
that
are
outlined?
could
the
union
bring
an
action
in
court
to
force
it
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
there's
nothing
in
this
contract
that
expressly
says
you
will
have
the
right
to
go
to
court
to
enforce
the
grievance
procedure.
so
it
must
just
be
by
implication
that
when
you
enter
into
that
sort
of
agreement
and
it's
breached,
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
can't
you
say
here
that
when
the
employer
discharges
for
cause,
and
it
isn't
a
correct
interpretation
of
cause,
he's
not
playing
by
the
rules
that
he
agreed
to
live
up
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
page.
mr.
gold,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
89-1166,
groves
versus
ring
screw
works.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
were
discharged
from
their
jobs
and
they
claimed
that
the
discharge
has
violated
their
collective
bargaining
agreements.
these
agreements
contained
a
voluntary
grievance
procedure,
but
the
agreement
said
nothing
about
possible
judicial
remedies.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
if
these
grievance
procedures
are
unsuccessful,
the
contract
should
be
construed
to
bar
recourse
to
the
court
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
in
this
case,
the
procedures
fail
to
resolve
the
parties'
dispute.
and
after
the
company
had
decided
not
to
request
arbitration
and
the
union
had
decided
not
to
strike,
the
petitioners
filed
this
action
invoking
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
section
301.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
petitioners
are
not
precluded
from
pursuing
the
judicial
remedy
because
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
did
not
explicitly
foreclose
such
a
remedy.
the
parties
are
free
to
decide
the
means
by
which
to
resolve
their
dispute,
and
such
means
can
include
economic
sanction
such
as
strikes
or
lockouts.
where
the
parties
have
failed
to
specify
the
method
of
their
final
resolution
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
we
will
not
construe
those
agreements
as
such
silence
in
effect
to
foreclose
access
to
the
courts.
our
opinion
in
this
case
is
unanimous.
