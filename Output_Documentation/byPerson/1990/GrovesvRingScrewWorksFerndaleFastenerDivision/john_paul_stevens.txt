justice
stevens
of
course,
they
made
that
decision
assuming
they
had
the
right
to
sue.
isn't
that
right,
because
they
did
go
ahead
and
sue?
so
you
don't
know;
if
they've
been
told
they
can't
sue,
maybe
they
would
have
kept...
they
would
have
struck.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
page,
are
you
in
effect
arguing...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand...
that
the
no-strike
clause
really
shouldn't
have
been
put
where
it
is,
but
it
should
have
been
step
5
of
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
stevens
well,
then
1,
2,
3,
4,
and
5
we
don't
agree
will
either
go
on
strike
or
lock
you
out.
justice
stevens
because
you
certainly
admit
that
if
you
had
put
in
a
provision
that
said
at
the
end
of
the
procedure,
the
parties
can
either
resort
to
economic
weapons
or
to
litigation.
there
would
be
nothing
unlawful
about
such
an
agreement.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
but
what
you're
saying
in
effect
the
strike
is
part
of
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
do
it
explicitly
at
all.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
they're
generally
speaking
there
in
terms
of
final
adjustment
by
the
methods
set
forth
in
the
contract,
rather
than
a
strike?
isn't
the
basic
policy
of
that
to
try
to
avoid
industrial
warfare
by
peaceful
means
when
they're
available?
justice
stevens
and
to
decide
where
they've
lived
up
to
the
substantive
terms
of
the
agreement,
it's
more
peaceful
to
go
out
on
strike
than
it
is
to
have
a
judge
decide
whether
the
contract
was
broken?
seems
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent
with
my
recollection
of
the
debates
back
in
1947.
justice
stevens
but
the
real
point
here
is
the
parties
did
not
choose
a
method
of
final...
final
adjustment.
they...
they
opted
for
mediation
and
strikes
which
are
not
methods
of
final
adjustment.
justice
stevens
they're
methods
of
arguing
and
negotiating
and
fighting
it
out
by...
without
having
a
finality
to
any
of
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
they're
not
legitimate
means
of
getting
final
adjustment
of
a
dispute.
i
mean
maybe...
i
mean
what
the
right
answer
is
in
the
dispute--
justice
stevens
--sure.
justice
stevens
by
going
on
strike.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
just
another
question.
isn't...
couldn't
you
solve
this
problem
very
simply
by
saying,
adding
a
sentence
saying...
instead
of
just
saying
there
should
be
no
strikes
in
nor
shall
there
be
any
litigation.
will
you
waive
our
right
to
sue?
justice
stevens
because
you
could
do
that
in
the
future
if
you're
unhappy...
say
we
decide
against
you.
i'm
not
saying...
i
don't
know
what
the
court
will
do...
but
if
the
court
should
decide
against
you,
you
could
protect
yourself
in
the
future
by
negotiating.
justice
stevens
sure.
both...
you
could
have
done
that
expressly
either
way.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
they
could
have
agreed
to
something
less
here.
instead
of
a
four-step
mediation
proceeding,
i
suppose
they
could
have
agreed
that
before
discipline
is
imposed
on
the
employee
you'll
give
notice
to
the
shop
steward
and
he'll
have
48
hours
in
which
to
talk
to
the
informant
of
the
particular
plant
and
once
that's
done,
you
can
go
ahead
and
strike.
that
would
be
the
method
agreed
upon
under
your
view,
wouldn't
it?
it
doesn't
have
to
be
four-step
agreements.
justice
stevens
it
could
be
a
very
simple
notice
provision.
justice
stevens
we
didn't
expressly
agree,
but
maybe
implicit...
you
know,
it's
a
question
of
which
way
you
run
the
presumption.
