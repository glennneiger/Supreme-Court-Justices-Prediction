mr.
terence
v.
page
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
once
there
is
in
existence
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
a
dispute
resolution
process
within
that
agreement
and
that
a
grievance
is
filed
and
those
grievances
run
the
route
of
the
dispute
resolution
process
in
the
agreement,
should
the
court
presume
that
the
end
result
is
final
or
not
final?
i
agree
it
is
a
battle
of
presumptions.
with
respect
to
the
number
of
contracts
in
which
this
language
might
be
found,
i
can
say
to
the
court
that
the
bureau
of
national
affairs
contains
a
database
of
approximately
400...
i
should
say
approximately
400
collective
bargaining
agreements.
36
percent
of
those
agreements
call
for
resolution
by
some
method
other
than
arbitration.
mr.
terence
v.
page
i
would
say
to
the
court
the
only
comprehensive
article
on
the
issue,
that
of
professor
feller,
who
was
the
successful
counsel
who
argued
before
this
court
the
trilogy
in
the
vaca
case,
who
was
general
counsel
to
the
united
steelworkers,
and
he
said
that
the
reason
the
parties--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--to
some
extent.
but...
but
the
reason
the
parties
would
do
this
is
because
they
consider
this
issue
so
important
that
they
do
not
want
third-party
intervention.
they
treat
it
on
the
same
level
as
they
do
the
formation
of
the
contract
in
the
first
place,
that...
that
it's
so
important
to
them
that
they
want
to
decide
it
themselves.
now,
the
rule
i
would
suggest--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--your
honor--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
agreement
does
call...
call
for
the
resolution
of
the
grievance
and
that
that
should
be
binding.
and
it
calls
for
it
in
this
manner.
there's
a
four-step
conciliation
process,
if
you
will,
about
where
the
parties
meet
and
discuss
it.
if
it
isn't
resolved
at
that
juncture,
the
union
has
an
option
to
present
to
its
membership
the
option
to
strike
vote
which
was
presented
in
this
case.
now,
if
the
union--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--that's
right.
mr.
terence
v.
page
no,
your
honor--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--i
don't
concur
with
the
court
that
we
agree
to
nothing,
because
if
the
union
chooses
to
strike
in
support
of
the
grievance,
that
pressures
both
parties
to
come
back
to
the
negotiating
table
and
resolve
it
and
that
the
fact
that
they
choose
that
kind
of
method
for
compelling
negotiation
and
indeed
compelling
resolution
indicates
the
importance
with
which
they
attach
to
resolution
of
the...
of
the
grievance
in
the
first
place.
so
i
submit
that
the
process...
the
grievance
process
is
not
just
the
first
four
conferences,
if
you
will.
it
includes
the
strike
lockout,
because
what
happens
is
if
it
isn't
resolved
in
the
first
four
steps
and
it's
thrown
over
into
that
article
of
a
contract,
what
occurs
then
is
that
pressures
both
parties
to
sit
down
and
resolve
the
grievance,
because,
indeed,
the
union
doesn't
want
to
stay
on...
stay
on
strike
over
agreements
and
indeed
the
employer
doesn't
want
to
stay
inoperable
because...
so
i
think
that
that
is...
that
that
strike
lockout
step
is
a
continuation
of
the
grievance
process
which
compels
a
resolution.
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
when
the
union
membership
declined
to
go
on
strike
in
support
of
that
grievance
that
that
ended
consideration
of
the
grievance
and
in
effect
constituted
a
denial
which
was
arrived
at
at
the
prior
step.
so,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
this...
this
process
does
compel--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--well,
your
honor,
again
we
come
back
to
a
presumption
that's
correct.
they
might
have
struck
and,
of
course,
it
depends
on
what
took
place
at
that
union
hall
meeting
in
terms
of
what
they're
told.
but
i
should
say
to
the
court
that
it's
never
been
contended
in
this
lawsuit
by
the
petitioners
that
there
was
any
kind
of
indication
either
expressly
or
impliedly
by
the
employer
of
a
willingness
or
an
acquiescence
that
any
issue
should
be
resolved
pursuant
to
a
301
lawsuit.
mr.
terence
v.
page
there
is...
and
i
think
the
principle
of
lincoln
mills
here
is
very
important...
i
think
the
critical
starting
point
in
case.
in
lincoln
mills
the
court
said
that
the
substantive
law
of
301
was
to
be
fashioned
by
the
federal
courts
consistent
with
the
policy
of
our
national
labor
laws
and
which
brings
in
the
question,
what
is
the
policy
of
our
national
labor
laws?
and
i
think
this
court,
through
a
number
of
opinions,
has
ratified
that
the
policy
is
expressed
in
section
203(d)
which
states
that
final
adjustment
by
a
method
chosen
by
the
parties
is
declared
to
be
the
desirable
method
by
which
grievances
are
settled
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
and
collective...
and
application
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
if
the
substantive
law
is
to
be
developed
and
consistent
with
the
policy
and
the
policy
is
final
adjustment
by
a
method
chosen
by
the
parties
and
clearly
that
was
the
legislative
history,
this
court's
interpretation,
the
statutory
language
itself,
all
speaks
to
the
fact
that
that
is
the
policy,
final
adjustment
by
a
method
agreed
to
by
the
parties.
mr.
terence
v.
page
your
honor--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--there
is
a
right
of
judicial
enforcement,
your
honor.
i
should
indicate
that
what
this
court
has
done,
you
know,
and
i'll
analogize...
to
use
an
analogy
here,
what
this
court
has
done
is
said
the
parties
agree
upon
the
rules.
indeed,
the
concept
of
industrial
self-government
discussed
in
the
trilogy.
the
parties
will
agree
on
the
rules
of
the
game.
they
are
best
situated.
they
are
the
ones
who
are
present
in
the
plain
environment.
they
determine
the
rules
and
what
the
court
has
done
consistently
with
respect
to
301
is
step
back
and
say,
we
will
umpire--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--yes,
and
i
think
the
301
law
is,
your
honor,
that
if
there
is
no
grievance
process,
that
the
parties
can
go
in
court
to
enforce.
but
when
there
is
a
grievance
process
which
we
contend
here
is
the
first
four
steps
plus
then
going
into
the
strike
out...
strike
lockout
to
compel
the
resolution,
that
when
there
is
a
process,
the
courts
give
finality
to
that
process
and
sit
as
long
as
the
rules,
to
wit
the
grievance
procedure,
is
adhered
to.
the
only
time
this
court
has
used
301
authority
is
it's
developed
the
substantive
law
consistent
with
the
policy,
the
final
adjustment
by
the
parties.
the
only
time
this
court
has
exerted
its
authority,
that
the
federal
courts
have
exerted
their
authority
to
enforce
contracts
is
to
make
the
parties
play
the
game
pursuant
to
the
rules
by
which
they
said
they
would
play
it
in
the
agreement.
mr.
terence
v.
page
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--yes,
your
honor,
and
as--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--that's
right.
mr.
terence
v.
page
that's
right.
mr.
terence
v.
page
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
indicated
particularly
strongly
in
the
evans
case
where
it
indicates
in
the
grievance
procedure
that
unresolved
grievances
shall
be
resolved
pursuant
to
article
16,
i
think
paragraph
7.
and
so
the
grievance
procedure
specifically
continues
on
over
into
that
process.
it
does
the
same
thing
in
the
groves
contract.
it
just
doesn't
do
it
quite
as
explicitly.
mr.
terence
v.
page
no,
but
article
16
in
the
groves
contract
again
says
that...
that
the
grievance
procedure
will
fulfilled
by
both
parties
before
the
strike
lockout
method
comes
into
play.
mr.
terence
v.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
terence
v.
page
well,--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--the
contract
isn't
worthless,
because
the...
the
method
does
achieve
a
result
to
that
issue.
it
doesn't
leave
the
subject
open--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--well,
yes
but,
i
mean,
does
a
union
strike
for
that
purpose
when
the
contract
clearly
delineates
what
the
wage
rate
is?
if
the
policy
of
the
legislation,
of
the
taft-hartley
legislation,
is
to
be
effectuated
i
submit
and
the
courts
have
recognized
203(d)
as
the
policy
that
the
american
manufacturing...
that
the
language
in
the
american
manufacturing
is
particular
helpful.
the
court
states
in
conjunction
with
203(d)
that
that
policy,
a
final
adjustment
by
means
chosen
by
the
parties,
can
be
effectuated
only
if
the
means
chosen
by
the
parties
for
settlement
of
their
differences
on
their
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
given
full
play.
mr.
terence
v.
page
yes,
because
those...
as
this
court
has
developed
the
law
of
section
301
and
what
the
court
has
said
that
in
the
vaca
case
that
if
the
employer
repudiates
the
agreement...
in
other
words,
doesn't
play
the
rules
it
agreed
to
play
by...
if
the
union
doesn't
render
unfair...
renders
unfair
representation,
in
fact,
doesn't
live
up
to
its
duty
to
represent
its
employees,
a
301
claim
will
lie
despite
finality.
so
that...
in
the
third
case
where
this
court
has
said
a
301
lawsuit
will
lie
is
where
the
parties
have
indicated,
expressly
indicated
a
willingness
that...
that
the
parties
could
go
to
court
to
settle
a
dispute.
mr.
terence
v.
page
your
honor,
this
court
has
developed
301.
this
court
has
said
that
this
is
what
301
means.
you
can
go
to
court
when
there's
repudiation,
the
employer
doesn't
live
up
to
the
rules
that
he
agreed
to
live
up
by...
live
up
to,
when
the
union
doesn't
fairly
represent
the
employees
or
when
the
parties
expressly
indicate
a
willingness
to
go
to
court.
mr.
terence
v.
page
because,
your
honor,
between...
because
the
contract
has
established
a
dispute
resolution
process
and
inherent...
when
the
employer
said...
gave
up
his...
his
right
to
discharge
at
will
and
said,
i'll
only
discharge
for
cause.
part
of
that
commitment
by
him
was
that
the
dispute
would
be...
if
a
dispute
arose
as
to
what
constituted
just
cause,
it
would
be
resolved
through
the
mechanism
that's
provided
for
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
that's...
and
i
think
that's
really
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
this
legislation,
the
taft-hartley
legislation,
if
there
was
one...
if
there
was
a
policy
that...
that
was
enunciated
and
clearly
there
was
and
the
statutory
language
and
what
this
court
has
said
about
it
in
the
legislative
history,
it
was
final
adjustment
by
the
method
chosen
by
the
parties.
and
i
submit
that
the
parties
have
chosen
a
method.
mr.
terence
v.
page
no,
your
honor,
what
lincoln
mills
said
and
i
think
it's...
i
should
say
i
think
it's
been
repeated
subsequently
by
this
court...
what
lincoln
mills
says
is
that
industrial
peace
is
achieved
when
the
parties
live
up
to
the
agreement
that
they
bargained.
and
that's
where
industrial
peace
comes
from.
mr.
terence
v.
page
the
strike
certainly
i
would
concur
that
the
perception
of
being
resolved
by
an
arbitrator
is
more
peaceful
than...
than
a
strike.
however,
there...
the
preemptive
policy
of
title
vii
and
i
think
it's
clearly
expressed
in
201
and
203(d)...
the
preemptive
policy
of
taft-hartley
is
that
the
method...
final
adjustment
by
the
method
chosen
by
the
parties
is
the
desirable
method
to
resolve
differences.
mr.
terence
v.
page
your
honor--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--i
would
first
say
that
strikes
are
recognized
by
this
court
as
legitimate
means
to
resolve
differences.
mr.
terence
v.
page
in...
in
a
footnote
in
the
trilogy,
the
court
recognized
the
existence
of
contracts
where...
where
grievances...
that
aren't
resolved
at
through
the
conciliatory
steps--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--can
result
in
strike.
and
if
that's
the
method
that
the
parties
chose
and
that's
the
policy
that
industrial
peace
is
best
achieved
by--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--yes.
if
that's
what
they
feel...
if
that's
what
the
parties
feel
works
best
for
them,
and
i
think
that
what
the
courts
have...
what
the
court
has
done
over
the
years
is
it's
given
deference
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
parties
agree
to.
it
recognizes
that
they're
best
situated
to--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
v.
page
yes,
your
honor.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
the
other
party
to
the
agreement
could
have
said,
we
reserve
the
right
to
go
court.
mr.
terence
v.
page
so
we
come
down
to
what
is
the
presumption
when
silence
exists.
mr.
terence
v.
page
and
i
submit
that
if
the
rule
of
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
that
we're
going
to
develop
the
law
of
301
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
statute,
then
the
policy...
the
preemptive
policy
of
the
statute
is
that
final
adjustment
by
means
chosen
by
the
parties
that,
that
to
the...
as
this
court
decides
this
case
to
the...
if
the
substantive
rule
to
be
consistent
with
the
policy
of
taft-hartley
is
that
the
presumption
of
finality
should
attach.
i
should
indicate
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
allow
a...
for
example,
a
grievance
to
run
the
gamut
of
the
grievance
procedure
contained
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
if
dissatisfied
with
the
result,
then
go
to
court
for
a
second
bite
of
the
apple.
this
court
has
always
confined
301
to
compelling
the
parties
to
living
up
to
the
dispute
resolution
process
they
agreed
to.
mr.
terence
v.
page
but,
your
honor,
well,
it's--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
it--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--what
it
means,
your
honor,
is
that...
is
that
the
parties
have...
that
a
strike...
that
these
parties,
as
they
sit
in
the
workplace
and
decide
upon
the
common
law
of
what
works
best
for
them,
that
they
have
decided
that
this
method
best
resolves
their--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--yes.
mr.
terence
v.
page
this
method
for
interpreting
the
contract
and
the
way
the
strike
and
the
lockout
plays
into
that
is
that
perhaps
these
parties
over
the
bargaining
history
realize
that
if
they
put
that
kind
of
element
as
their
last
step
in
the
procedure,
that
neither
party
will
ever
get
to
it
and
will
put
pressure
on
the
parties
to
resolve
it
at
a
lesser
step.
the
court
has
never
taken
the
position
that
strike...
that
a
strike
or
lockout
to
resolve...
to
resolve
a
grievance
is
impermissible.
mr.
terence
v.
page
no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor.
i
mean
there
was...
there
was--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--yes.
mr.
terence
v.
page
i
believe--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--given
a
his
history
in
detroit,
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
v.
page
we
might
have
decided
otherwise,
i
believe.
mr.
terence
v.
page
well,
there
it's...
no,
except...
i
mean
they
certainly
were
indicating
that
perhaps
a
preference,
a
preference
to
write
the
other
way.
but
i
would
say
this,
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
continue
to
give
substantive
law
to
301
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
legislation
and
the
policy
of
the
legislation
is
that
the
parties
resolved
the
grievance
themselves,
that
this
court
should
do
what
it
has
always
done
and
that
is
say
that
we're
going
to
stand
on
the
sidelines,
let
you
play
the
game
according
to
the
rules
that
you
decided
to
play
them
by
provided,
of
course,
they
don't
violate
public
law
and
if
either
of
you
then
deviate
from
the
rules
you
agreed
upon,
we're
going
to
compel
you
to
live
up
to
the
rules
as
you
agreed.
we
are
not
going
to
develop
a
new
set
of
rules
for
you
to
play
the
game.
and
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
court
has
never
done
the
petitioner's
request
here.
the
court
has
never
said,
run
the
gamut
of
your
grievance
procedure
and
if
you
don't
like
the
result,
then
we're
going
to
give
you
another
bite
of
the
apple
in
a
301
lawsuit.
i
think
that
what
301
has
been
will
enforce
the
game
as
you
have
created
it.
we
will
not
give
you
a
second
chance
before
a
federal
district
court
jury
to
achieve
what
you
couldn't
achieve
pursuant
to
your
dispute
resolution
process
that
you
agreed
upon.
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
there
is
no
right
to
arbitration
with
respect
to
the...
while
the
court
has
favored
arbitration,
it
has
explicitly
said
that
we
are
not
going
to
coerce
or
compel
an
employer
to
put
arbitration
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
date
and
the
method
they
choose
is
the
method
that
we're
going
to
respect.
mr.
terence
v.
page
yes,
your
honor,
that's...
i
believe
that's
smith
v.--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--yes,
they
could
also
strike.
mr.
terence
v.
page
no,
your
honor.
but
i
can
say
that
they
have
agreed
upon
the
method
by
which
they're
going
to
resolve
it.
mr.
terence
v.
page
and
that's
the
policy
that
they
should
live
up
to.
mr.
terence
v.
page
your
honor,
i
think
the
parties
are
committed
to
the
process
they
agreed
on
and
that's
the
one
they
have
to
live
by.
i
don't
think
either
of
them
can
go
to
court
unless
they
fail
to
live
up...
live
up
to
the
rules
that
they
agreed
on.
mr.
terence
v.
page
well,
your
honor--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--well,
i
think
that's...
if
they
don't...
the
alternative
to
promising
to
negotiate
is
to
call
for
arbitration
and,
again,
the
courts,
while
favoring
arbitration...
i
think
the
carbon
fuel
case
said
it
best
is...
while
arbitration
might
color
the
interpretation
of
a
contract,
it
will
never
result
in
the
court
imposing
it
on
the
parties.
mr.
terence
v.
page
no,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
v.
page
it
could
be
a
shorter
step.
but
what
lincoln
mills
said
is,
we
best
effectuate
the
policy
by
adhering
to
the
means
chosen
by
the
parties.
i
suppose
the
ultimate
issue
here
is
whether
the
parties
agreed
that
the
court
would
be
available
or
it
wouldn't
be
available.
the
issue
really
is
what
did
you
agree
upon.
you've
got
this
conflicting
battle
of
presumption.
we
did
not
agree
in
terms
of
whether
to
go
to
court
or
not
clearly,
your
honor.
so
what...
so
then--
mr.
terence
v.
page
--well,
yeah,
the
one
contract
indicates
that
unresolved
grievances
will
be
processed
through
article
16.
but
the
point...
the
rule
we
asked
for
is
that
the
presumption
is
finality,
because
that
is
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
legislation
and
this
court
has
never
gone
beyond
saying
which
can
go
to
in
three
instances,
repudiation
by
the
employer
and
for
representation
by
the
union
or
if
the
parties
indicate
a
willingness...
express
a
willingness
to
go
to
court.
this
court,
as
its
developed
the
substantive
law
of
301
has
always
said,
we
are
going
to
use
it
to
make
you
agree
to
the
process
that
was
arrived
at
through
the
collective
bargaining
process,
your
industrial
self-government.
it's
given
deference
to
that
contract
and
because
the
legislation
clearly
expresses
its
policy
of
final
adjustment
by
a
means
chosen
by
the
parties,
that
this
court
has
never
taken
301
beyond
enforcing
the
methods
chosen
by
the
parties.
and
i
ask
the
court
not
to
do
it
in
this
case.
thank
you.
