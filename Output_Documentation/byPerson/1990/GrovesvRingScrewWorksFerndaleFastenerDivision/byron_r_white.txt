justice
white
--well,
what
if
this
suit
goes
forward
and
the
ruling
is
against
the
union?
can
the
union
strike?
justice
white
mr.
gold,
you
can
give
a
yes
or
no
answer.
justice
white
and
so
in
effect
you
think
the
contract
says,
we
don't
have
arbitrators,
but
we
have
agreed
that
the
court
will
stand
on
issues
with
arbitrators?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
what
the
contract
says.
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i
say.
it
didn't
provide
that--
justice
white
--but
the
grounds
for
a
court
to...
not
to
accept
the
arbitral
award
are
very
narrow.
justice
white
well,
is
this
case...
is
it
very
significant
because
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
parties
are...
do
you
think
the
union
would
ever
have
agreed
to
a
provision
in
this
particular
contract
that
economic
weapons
are
the
only
way
to
resolve
an
unsettled
agreement?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
if
you
had
thought
that
the
union
would
have
said
yes
if
the
employer
said,
and
by
the
way
you
can't
sue.
you
probably
wouldn't
have
been
here--
justice
white
and
in
the
state
court.
justice
white
301
cases
can
go
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
well,
the...
i
suppose
if
there
weren't
a
no-strike
clause
and
no
provision
for
either
grievances
or
arbitration,
it
would
be
perfectly
clear
that
you
sue
in
301.
justice
white
not
because
of
some
presumption,
because
that's
what
the
law
says.
justice
white
and
the--
justice
white
--well,
of
course
it
does.
justice
white
you
think,
you
think
this
case
is
just
like
the
one
i
just
posed?
justice
white
well,
he
didn't
quite
prevail
in
vaca.
justice
white
well,
you
don't
really
think
that,
that
the...
a
strike
or
a
lockout
is
going
to
settle
what
the
contract
means?
you
just
say
it
will
be
a
trial
of
strengths.
justice
white
right
or
wrong?
justice
white
you
think
a
strike
or
a
lockout...
whoever
wins
is
going...
that
is
going
to
decide
what
the
contract
meant?
justice
white
does
it
or
not?
justice
white
this
method
for
settling...
for
doing
what?
for
interpreting
the
contract?
justice
white
or
just
trying
who...
finding
out
who's
the
strongest?
justice
white
what
is
the...
what
is
the
contract
in
the...
provide
for
grievances
and
there
was
no
strike
clause
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
then
you
could
sue
under
301?
justice
white
even
though
they
could
also
strike.
justice
white
so
you
can't
say
that
just
because
they
can
strike
there's
no
contract?
justice
white
all
right.
