justice

mr.
gold,
i
suppose
your
case
or
the
case,
really
comes
down
to
a
battle
of
presumptions,
doesn't
it?
justice
blackmun
you...
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
access
to
judicial
relief
unless
the
contract
expressly
provides
otherwise.
your
opponents
say
just
the
reverse,
that
there's
no
access
to
judicial
relief
unless
the
contract
says
there
is.
justice
blackmun
and
there
we
are.
justice
blackmun
mr.
page,
the
court
of
appeals
wasn't
very
enthusiastic
about
the
result
of
breach,
was
it?
justice
blackmun
it
goes
back
to
the
fortune
case
as
precedent--
justice
blackmun
--which
was
written
by
judge
george
edwards--
justice
blackmun
--who
i
would
have
assumed
would
be
sensitive
to
union
and
employer
problems.
justice
blackmun
but
clearly
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
were
we
writing
on
a
clean
slate
we
would
have
decided
otherwise.
justice
blackmun
any
explanation
for
that?
