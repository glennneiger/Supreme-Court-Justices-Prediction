justice
scalia
i
was
intrigued
by
that
theory.
that
would
mean
that
if
you
have
at
the
state
level
the
equivalent
of
independent
regulatory
agencies
that
we
have
at
the
federal
level,
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
federal
communications
commissions,
and
so
forth,
whose
people
are
not
cabinet
officers.
they
are
not
part
of
the
president's
team.
the
whole
theory
of
it
is
that
they
are
supposed
to
be
independent.
you
assert
that
those
people
would
not
be
covered
by
this
exemption,
right?
they
have
to--
justice
scalia
--they
have
to
be
not
only
appointed
by
the
elected
official,
but
they
have
to
be
subject
to
his
direction
and
command.
justice
scalia
now
why,
why
would
they
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction?
that
seemed
to
me
very
strange.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
the
people
who
vote
for
other
officials
have
a
better
knowledge
of
whether
they
are
doing
a
good
or
bad
job,
and
maybe
it's
a
lot
harder
for
the
voter
to
know
whether
a
judge
is
doing
a
good
or
bad
job
because
it
depends
upon
interpretation
of
a
lot
of
dusty
old
statutes.
isn't
that
a
rational
basis?
you
can
trust
the
electorate
to
know
when,
when
an
elected
executive
or
legislative
official
can't
hack
it
anymore,
but
you
really
can't
trust
them
to
know
whether
a
judge
is
doing
it.
justice
scalia
does
it
have
to
be
an
articulated
one?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
think
we
have
guessed
all
the
time.
justice
scalia
mr.
deutsch,
you
know,
we
have
to
make
the
best
we
can
of
the
language
that
congress
wrote
for
us.
you
say
there
are
three
exceptions
set
forth
there,
right?
one
is
any
person
elected
to
public
office,
right?
justice
scalia
and
then
any
person
chosen
by
such
officer
to
be
on
such
officer's
personal
staff.
i
guess
four.
justice
scalia
or
an
appointee
on
the
policy
level.
and
you
say
that
goes
all
by
itself.
justice
scalia
we
should
try
not
to
err
at
all.
i
think
we're
going
to
try
to
get
it
just
right.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
deutsch,
was
the...
do
you
know
whether
the
adea
was
based
exclusively
on
the
commerce
clause,
or
was
it
also
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
scalia
oh.
the
conference
committee
said
that.
i
thought--
