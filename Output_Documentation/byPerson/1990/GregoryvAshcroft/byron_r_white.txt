justice
white
well,
in
order
to
have
another
term
he
has
to
get
the
votes,
doesn't
he?
justice
white
i
know,
but
he
is
out
of
office
if...
i
mean,
his
term
is
over.
justice
white
how
does
he
manage
to
get
another
term?
justice
white
well,
how
does
he
get
another
term?
his
term
is
over,
how
does
he
get--
justice
white
--so
in
effect
the
voters
who
vote
to
retain
him
say
yes,
he
should
have
another
term.
justice
white
why
isn't
he
elected?
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
but
the
governor
can't
give
him
another
term.
justice
white
the
electorate
has
to
give
him
another
term.
justice
white
well,
anyway,
that
issue
isn't
here,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
suppose...
is
there
still
a
common
law
element
in
missouri,
isn't
there?
justice
white
judges
keep
developing
the
common
law
in
missouri?
justice
white
and
they
have
to,
they
have
to
decide
what
the
rule
is
to
decide
a
case?
justice
white
and
you
think
that
is...
that
isn't
making
any
kind
of
policy?
justice
white
so
you
would
say
that...
i
suppose
you
have
administrative
agencies
in
the
state?
justice
white
and
they
are
authorized
by
the
legislature
to
issue
regulations--
justice
white
--implementing
the
statute?
justice
white
and
those
people
are
appointed?
justice
white
therefore
unprotected
by
the
ad...
by
the
age
discrimination
act?
justice
white
well,
they're
members
of
the
agency
that
issue
the
regulations.
justice
white
although
the
judges
who
review
their
issuance
of
the
regulations
are
not?
justice
white
so...
well,
you
would
say
that
if
an
administrative
agency
in
your
state
is
authorized
to
issue
regulations
interpreting
a
statute
and
to...
and
to
adjudicate
cases
based
on
that
regulation,
those
regulators
are
not
protected,
as
you
said
a
minute
ago?
justice
white
well,
what
if
they,
what
if
the
agency
decides
well,
regulations
are
fine
but
we're
going
to
operate
by
adjudication.
we're
going
to
announce
all
of
our
rules
by
adjudication,
and
we're
going
to
follow
our
rules
that
we
announce
by
adjudication.
just
stare
decisis.
that's
going
to
be
the
rule.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
those
regulators
are
protected
or
unprotected?
justice
white
unprotected?
justice
white
because
they--
justice
white
--but
common
law,
the...
when
they
announced
the
rule
in
the
case
they
were
announcing
one
that
they
were
going
to
apply
in
all
future
cases.
justice
white
yes,
but
there
may
be
terrific
campaigns
going
to,
on
both
sides
of
the
issue,
should
this
fellow
be
or
this
lady
be
retained
or
not.
justice
white
there
may
be
a
lot
of
money
spent
on
both
sides
of
the
case.
justice
white
haven't
there
been
some
votes,
some
numbers
of
votes
against
retention
on
certain
people?
justice
white
well,
would
you
say
that,
would
you
say
the
age
discrimination
act
is
unconstitutional
in
exempting
elected
officials?
justice
white
well,
couldn't
you
argue
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
exempting
them?
justice
white
well,
you
just
did.
justice
white
well,
you...
you
said
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
not
protecting
these
elected
judges.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
not
even
as
applied
to
judges?
justice
white
xxx
normally
call
them
law
makers.
justice
white
you
would
describe
them
as
making
the
common
law,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
you
don't
find
it
under
some
rock?
justice
white
well,
not
if
it's
disjunctive.
justice
white
but
the...
but
even
these
judges
who
are
appointed
initially,
their
terms
expire
and
in
order
to
have
a
subsequent
term
they
have
to
be
voted
on.
justice
white
why
would
it...
why
would
the
state...
why
would
your
state
have
an
occasion
to
decide
that
question?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
why?
what...
with--
justice
white
--i
see.
justice
white
well,
you
certainly
could
say
that
judges
could
only
serve
one
term.
justice
white
but
you
could
say
judges,
whether
they
are
elected
or
appointed,
can
only
serve
one
term.
