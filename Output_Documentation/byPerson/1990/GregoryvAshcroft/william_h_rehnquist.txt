chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-50,
ellis
p.
gregory
and
anthony
p.
nugent
v.
john
d.
ashcroft.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
shoemake,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court...
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
judges
were
not
elected
officials
in
missouri,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
come
out
differently.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
justice
o'connor's
question
was
addressed
not
to
whether
the
state
was
covered
as
an
employer,
which
it
obviously
is
under,
certainly
we
upheld
that
in
eeoc
against
wyoming,
but
whether
the
statute,
in
view
of
the
proviso,
should
be
found
to
reach
state
court
judges.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
shoemake,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
covers...
the
exemption
exempts
elected
officials
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
any
person
chosen
by
such
officer
to
be
on
such
officer's
personal
staff,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
or
an
appointee
on
the
policy-making
level.
now,
that
must
mean
something
more
than
just
an
appointee
on
an
elected
official's
staff
or
you
wouldn't
need
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
do
agree
that
the
phrase
"appointee
on
the
policy-making
level"
is
independent
of
the
phrase
"a
person
chosen
by
such
officer
to
be
on
such
officer's
personal
staff?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
missouri
at
one
time
have
an
exemption
from
tort
liability
for
charitable
institutions,
charities?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it...
does
it
still
have
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
result
changed
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
think
that
was
policy
making?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
now,
are
those
circuit
judges,
do
you
contend
they
are
covered
by
the
adea?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
how
about
your
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
with
respect
to
the
judges
who
would
be
covered
by
the
adea,
and
so...
the
appellate
judges
in
missouri?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
those
elections
hotly
contested?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
something
to
be
said,
though,
for
public
office,
high
public
office
turning
over
every
so
often?
and
with
your
other
high
public
officials
in
missouri
you
have
regular,
you
know,
4-year
election.
with
judges
you
have
a
much
longer
term.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
appellate
judges?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
except
they
are,
they
have
shorter
terms,
certainly,
than
the
appellate
judges.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shoemake.
mr.
deutsch,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
deutsch.
mr.
shoemake,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shoemake.
the
case
is
submitted.
