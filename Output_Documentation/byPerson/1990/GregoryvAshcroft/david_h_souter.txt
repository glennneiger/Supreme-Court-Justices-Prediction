justice
souter
the
problem
is
the
word
"elected
to
office".
isn't
that
where
you
get
into
trouble?
he
isn't
to
it.
he
was
appointed
to
it,
and
the
election
goes
to
retention.
justice
souter
mr.
deutsch,
with
respect
to
the
associate
circuit
judges,
they
have
$15,000
civil
jurisdiction?
is
that
right?
justice
souter
well,
within
that
jurisdiction
they
could
be
asked
to
recognize
a
new
common
law
cause
of
action,
couldn't
they?
justice
souter
and
if
requested
they
would
have
the
option
to
do
so,
subject
to
appeal,
wouldn't
they?
justice
souter
how
is
that
significant
in
determining
what
congress
meant,
though?
justice
souter
i
mean,
it
shows
they
don't
fall
into
sort
of
one
paradigm
for
the
selection
of
people
to
run
for
office,
but
that's
as
far
as
it
goes.
