mr.
james
b.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
contains
many
interesting
issues
of
statutory
construction
and
legislative
history,
constitutional
law.
i
plan
to
first
address,
as
my
colleague
did,
the
appointed
officials'
exemption,
although
i
will
then
address
the
elected
officials'
exemption,
because
we
do
believe
it
is
properly
before
the
court,
and
i
do
intend
to
seek
the
benefit
of
that
exemption
for
the
state
of
missouri,
finally
concluding
with
the
constitutional
issues,
if
i
have
time.
if
missouri's
non-partisan
court
plan
judges
are
appointed
officials,
as
the
petitioners
contend,
then
they
are
most
certainly
appointed
officials
on
the
policy-making
level
within
the
meaning
of
the
adea
and
exempt
from
the
requirements
of
adea
by
the
language
of
the
act.
i
will
tell
you
that
the
language
of
this
statute
is
not
a
masterpiece
of
legislative
draftsmanship.
i
do
not
find
it
to
be
clear.
however,
i
do
find
from
the
legislative
history
that
there
were
at
least
two
motivating
purposes
in
congress'
mind,
and
the
first
of
those
was
federalism.
the
first
principle
that
senator
irvin
had
in
mind
in
introducing
this
amendment
was
that
he
did
not
want
to
infringe
upon
the
prerogatives
of
the
state
in
the
selection
of
their
own
government
officials,
their
own
form
of
government.
the
second
principle
was
one
that
has
already
been
announced,
and
that
is
that
the
congress
realized
that
some
officials
in
government
had
their
own
cleansing
agent.
the
adea
seeks
to
prohibit
the
use
of
age
as
an
across-the-board
method
for
taking
people
out
of
public
as
well
as
private
employment.
however
congress
did
understand
that,
for
instance,
elected
officials
stand
before
the
electorate.
they
have
their
own
problems
to
deal
with.
they
do
not
need
coverage
of
the
adea,
and
indeed
it
is
unwise,
for
many
of
the
reasons
that
were
earlier
stated,
that
they
should
do
so.
the
voters
are
the
ones
that
decide
whether
elected
officials
have
done
their
job
and
whether
they
are
competent.
these
two
principles,
i
think,
when
read
into
the
statute
for
an
understanding,
although
still
not
creating
crystal
clarity,
i
think
makes
it
clear
that
the
congress
chose
broad
language.
the
congress
said
appointed
officials
on
the
policy-making
level,
in
addition
to
three
other
exemptions.
they
chose
broad
language,
they
chose
to
favor
federalism.
it
is
our
argument
to
this
court
that
the
court
should
indulge
them
that
favoritism
towards
the
federal
system
and
agree
that
all
state
judges
were
intended
to
be
exempted
by
this
particular
provision.
the...
there
appears
additionally
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
within
the
legislative
history
which
excludes
judges,
and
this
goes
to
the
question
of
a
clear
statement.
while
this
may
be
an
unusual
case,
perhaps,
for
the
application
of
a
clear
statement
because
the
congress
did
say
on
the
one
hand
it
applies,
and
then
turned
around
and
said
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
certain
people,
we
do
believe
that
given
the
interests
of
federalism
which
were
certainly
in
the
minds
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
clearly
in
the
mind
of
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
eeoc
v.
massachusetts,
that
the
principles
of
federalism
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
indicates
that
any
mention
of
the
judiciary
in
the
language
of
a
statute
which
otherwise
did
not
deal
with
specific
officials
was
probably
intentional.
it
was
intended
to
be
broad,
intended
to
be
broadly
read.
additionally,
we
would
suggest
that
the
contention
that
judges
are
not
policy
makers
be
categorically
rejected
by
this
court.
judges
most
certainly
are
policy
makers,
at
least
in
the
state
of
missouri,
which
is
a
common
law
state.
the
list
of
decisions
from
our
courts
that
have
outlined
and
defined
the
common
law
and
set
the
policy
for
the
state
of
missouri
is
endless.
and
more
than
that,
i
think
that
the
rather
disparaging
nature
of
describing
judges
and
their
work
to
be
law
in
fact
computers
that
simply
apply
known
principles
of
law
to
established
fact,
is
something
that
only
happens
in
the
easy
cases
which
usually
get
handled
by
two
lawyers
and
their
clients,
and
doesn't
even
make
it
before
a
court.
courts
deal
with
cases.
they
deal
with
disputes.
they
deal
with
real
problems.
it
is
inappropriate
to
describe
a
judge
on
any
basis
but
that
of
being
a
policy
maker.
i
would
note
that
the
petitioners,
of
course--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--that
was
one
of
the
terms
that
were
ascribed
to
them,
and
i
think
that
the
understanding
that
should
be
made
if
in
fact
the
congress
had
the...
any
knowledge--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--certainly.
they
make
law,
just
as
the
legislature
makes
law
in--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--well,
we
sometimes
wonder,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
it...
in
fact,
no,
the
courts
in
our
state
draw
upon
a
long
history
of
common
law
and
order
to
shape
the
common
law.
in
a
couple
of
the
instances
that
my
colleague
mentioned,
abolishment
of
sovereign
immunity
switching
to
a
comparative
fault
system
after
years
of
urging
our
legislature
to
do
so
to
no
avail,
our
courts
do
in
fact
make
policy.
but
i
think
that
the
important
thing
to
understand
is
that
the
petitioners
do
not
seem
to
describe
adequately
the
concept
of
policy
making
in
the
state
government
context.
everybody
in
state
government,
i
hope
everyone
in
the
federal
government,
is
confined
to
certain
parameters.
the
legislature
does
make
the
laws,
but
the
legislature
makes
the
laws
consistent
with
the
principles
of
the
constitutions,
both
state
and
federal.
the
executive
does
implement
the
laws
and
he
certainly
has
great
policy
making
potential
there,
but
he
has
to
stay
within
the
intent
of
statutes
that
are
enacted
by
the
legislature
and
also
within
the
constitution,
and
it
is
the
court's
job
to
make
sure
that
both
of
the
other
two
branches
stay
within
their
authority.
the
concept
of
policy
making
that
i
get
from
the
choice
of
language
by
the
congress
is
an
understanding
that
policy
in
the
government
sense
is
made
by
all
three
branches
of
government.
it
is
made
together.
it
sets
the
public
policy
for
the
state,
like
missouri,
for
all
of
the
other
states.
it
is
not
a
single
well-defined
monolithic
duty
of
one
branch.
it
is
something
that
applies
to
all
three
branches.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
there
are
four
separate
exemptions.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
well,
it...
from
the
way
that
the
statute
was
formed,
it
clearly
was
by
itself.
i
agree
that
its
placement
in
a
list
of
provisions
is
somewhat
unusual,
but
again,
it--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--it
is
disjunctive,
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
pointed
out
by
the
first
circuit
in
eeoc
v.
massachusetts,
is
that
it's
perhaps
not
the
most
easily
understood
statute
to
be
read,
but
clearly
the
house
added
that
last
provision,
really
the
third
exemption,
in
a
conference.
it
was
not
added
by
the
senate.
all
of
the
legislative
history
that
has
been
utilized
contained
only
the
three
exemptions
for
elected
officials,
for
immediate
advisors
and
personal
staff.
and
all
of
the
debates
concerning
that
naturally
do
seem
to
approach,
perhaps,
that
particular
form,
that
formulation
of
an
elected
official,
his
staff,
and
his
cabinet.
we
argue,
however,
that
the
congress
chose,
together,
house
and
senate,
the
appointed
official
on
the
policy-making
level.
it
is
broad.
it
should
be
interpreted
broadly
enough
to
include
officials
like
judges.
it
is
not
judges,
perhaps,
that
are
the
only
officials
who
would
fit
within
there,
but
clearly
judges
are
policy-making
officials
and
can
fit
within
that
exemption,
and
in
the
interest
of
federalism
should.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
the
missouri
plan
judges
are
appointees
of
the
governor
according
to
the
missouri
plan.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
he
is
an
elected
official.
that's
correct.
and
that
is
why
i
believe
that
the
structure
that
it
takes
on...
we
have
discussed
only
judges
because
that
is
what
is
at
issue
here.
however,
i
would,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
exemption
does
cover
the
example
that
was
made
earlier,
the
equivalent
of
the
icc
on
the
local
level
is
our
public
service
commission.
these
are
people
who
are
appointed
by
the
governor,
and
yes,
they
are
not
answerable
to
him.
they
are
not
supposed
to
be.
they
are
supposed
to
be
independent.
they
are
clearly
policy
makers.
they
are
appointed
for
terms
which
are
taken
beyond
any
individual
governor.
however
i
think
that
that
is
the
nature
of
the
position
that
was
had
in
mind
by
the
congress
when
they
enacted
that
position.
and
clearly,
when
you
consider
then
missouri
plan
judges,
they
fit
within
that
same
type
of
a
classification
of
an
appointee
made
by
the
governor
for
a
term
which
then
he
will
cease
to
have
any
control
over.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
i
think
that
that
was
the
intention.
and
i
think
what
they're
referring
there
to
is
the
cabinet
official
exemption,
the
illustration
that
was
so
often
used
in
the
senate
that
it
is
still
in
the
conference
report.
that
it
was
intended
to
limit
the
reach
down
through
the
chain
of
command,
especially
with
regard
to
the
elected
official,
and
using
the
governor
as
an
example,
to
be
an
immediate
advisor
under
that
particular
exemption.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
necessarily
read
in
conjunction
with
the
separate
exemption
for
appointed
judges.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
i
again
will
apologize
for
the
lack
of
clarity
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
that
is
an
available
reading.
that
is
the
reading,
i
think,
that
the
petitioners
would
place
upon
the
statute.
i
would
again
say
that
if
the
rule
to
be
applied,
however,
in
an
area
dealing
with
the
federal
and
state
balance,
which
this
is,
requires
some
degree
of
confidence
that
that
is
the
correct
interpretation,
that
degree
of
confidence
is
not
present,
and
in
fact
the
court
should,
if
it
errs
at
all
in
interpretation,
err
in
favor
of
the
federal-state
balance
and
its
maintenance.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
i
know
you
do,
your
honor.
additionally
we
would
suggest
that
all
judges
under
the
missouri
non-partisan
court
plan,
elected
and
appointed,
as
they
have
been
described,
are
exempt
from
the
requirements
of
adea
because
they
are
elected
officials,
elected
by
the
qualified
voters
of
the
state
of
missouri.
there
are
342
judges
in
the
state
of
missouri
under
article
v
of
our
constitution,
the
missouri
plan.
201
of
these
are
elected.
these
are
the
judges,
circuit
and
associate
circuit,
in
primarily
the
rural
areas
of
the
state.
they
do
run
in
partisan
elections.
40
percent
of
our
judges,
141,
are
under
the
missouri
plan.
they
are
appointed
by
the
governor.
they
are...
by
a
process
where
a
commission
appoints
or
selects
three
of
the
most
capable
applicants
who
apply
for
a
position,
the
governor
may
choose
one.
but
the
constitution
requires
that
this
individual
run
in
the
next
general
election
after
12
months
of
service
on
the
bench
in
a
retention
election.
we,
under
our
law,
under
an
interpretation
placed
on
that
since
1973,
find
under
state
law
that
is
an
elective
office.
it
has
not
lost
its
nature
as
an
elective
office
by
virtue
of
the
change
in
the
selection
process.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
that's
correct,
and
that
was...
in
a
short
footnote,
the
disposition
made
of
it
by
the
u.s.
district
court
was
that
these
are
not
elected
to
office.
these
judges
are
appointed
to
office
and
then
elected.
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
an
entirely
too
crabbed
an
interpretation
of
the
provision.
it
makes
really
very
little
sense.
what
the
court
would
seem
to
be
saying,
then,
is
that
judge
makanie,
who
at
one
time
was
in
this
case,
is
also
an
appointed
judge.
judge...
or
excuse
me,
governor
herns
appointed
him
to
office
and
then
he
later
ran
for
the
vacancy.
most
of
our
judges
are
appointed
by
the
governor
because
of
the
movement
within
the
judiciary
through
promotions
and
retirements,
and
most
of
the
officials
would
always
be
appointed
judges
if
this
is
the
case.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
that's
correct.
they
are
answerable
to
the
voters.
and
i
think
this
is
probably
the
crucial
element.
to
finish
up
the
answer
to
my
question,
i
believe
that
the
proper
construction
to
be
placed
upon
the
elected
officials'
exemption
is
that
it
should
be
elected
to
an
elective
office.
the
fact
that
an
office
is
appointed,
you
will
never
answer
to
the
voters
if
it
is
an
appointed
office.
however,
if
you
do
answer
to
the
voters,
i
believe
the
proper
construction
of
that
term
is
that
it
is
an
elective
office,
and
the
fact
that
you
may
be
appointed
to
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
nature
of
the
office,
and
that
is
in
fact
what
our
state
law
seems
to
hold.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
we
had
a
request
for
an
attorney
general's
opinion
back
in
1973.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
pardon
me?
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
because
the...
our
constitution
prohibits
a
member
of
the
general
assembly
from
succeeding
to
an
appointed--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--office
for
which
he
raised
the
emoluments,
and
that
occurred.
we
ruled,
however,
that
the
legislator
may
be
appointed
to
office
because
this
is
an
elective
office
under
state
law.
so
our
law
in
the
state,
which
we
respectfully
urge
that
deference
be
given
to,
does
make
this
an
elective
office.
and
as
i
was
beginning
to
get
back
to
your
point,
justice
white,
the
thing
to
understand
about
the
missouri
system
is
that
it
is
essentially
a
bit
of
a
bargain
between
the
members
of
the
judiciary
and
the
public.
the
members
of
the
public
want
the
highest
caliber,
highest
quality
judiciary
they
can
find.
we
have
found
in
our
state
that
elections
often
do
not
provide
the
highest
caliber
lawyers,
the
highest
caliber
officials
that
we
are
looking
for.
we
have
found
that
appointment
works
to
that
end.
however,
what
we
have
done
is
create
a
very
tough
selection
process,
very
hard
to
get
in.
certainly
political
credentials
will
not
always
serve
you
well.
and
we
have
granted
essentially
super-incumbency.
the
judge
who
is
appointed
serves
an
enormously
long
time,
particularly
on
the
court
of
appeals.
12
years
for
our
court
of
appeals
judges,
6
years
for
our
circuit
judges.
they
are
given
the
benefit
of
super-incumbency
because
they
run
against
no
opponent.
they
run
for
retention.
they
run
against
themselves.
it
is
true
that
no
one
has
ever
not
been
retained.
that's,
i
think,
a
matter
of
pride
in
the
state
of
missouri,
because
we
do
take
pride
in
our
judiciary.
but
at
the
end
of
the
term
there
is
a
price
to
be
paid.
and
that
is
the
price
that
the
voters
of
missouri
in
1970
enacted
overwhelmingly,
and
i
think
based
upon
experience
in
the
state
of
missouri,
that
a
mandatory
retirement
age
guarantees
that
the
benefits
of
this
super-incumbency
will
not
carry
on
forever,
that
it
will
end,
and
that
the
benefits
of
being
able
to
move
new
people
into
the
system,
into
the
judiciary,
will
be
obtained
through
an
orderly
attrition
created
by
mandatory
retirement.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
certainly.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
i
think
any
criminal
defendant
that
has
ever
stood
in
front
of
one
of
our
trial
judges
for
sentencing
probably
regards
him
as
a
policy
maker.
i
think
that
is
probably
one
example
of
where,
if
there
were
a
policy-making
function
and
you
had
to
figure
out
what
was
for
the
good
of
the
community,
what
the
common
and
accepted
principles
of
penology
would
have
to
say
about
the
sentence
you
were
about
to
mete
out,
all
of
the
things
that
go
into
a
determination
of
an
exercise--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--well,
of
course
they
participate
in
the
policy-making
judgments
for
the
judicial
branch
through
their
budget,
and
so
forth.
but
i
would
note
also,
your
honor,
that
in
the
policy-making
exemption
it
not
only
says
policy-making
level,
which
is
an
institutional
rather
than
functional
approach,
but
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
statute
that
says
that
you
make
policy
all
the
time,
or
you
make
it
half
the
time,
or
you
make
it
once
in
a
while.
i
think
that
an
understanding
of--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--associate
circuit
judge.
municipal
judges
are
excluded
from
the
plan.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
they
have,
i
believe
it's
a
$15,000
dollar
limit.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
they
have
criminal
court
jurisdiction.
they
do
a
lot
of
the
dwi's.
they
sentence
a
lot
of
the
defendants.
additionally
in
our
state--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--yes...
well,
particularly
because
in
our
state
depending
upon
the
circuit
and
its
caseload
the
presiding
judge
may
appoint
an
associate
circuit
judge
to
sit
as
a
circuit
judge.
that
happens
quite
frequently,
particularly
in
the
rural
areas
of
the
state,
because
although
in
a
circuit
there
may
be
only
one
circuit
judge
for
several
counties,
each
county
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
one
associate
circuit
judge,
and
that
is
their
judge.
he
is
the
highest
ranking
judicial
official
in
that
county
most
of
the
time.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
it
certainly
is.
and
it
is
prohibited
to
practice
law
while
holding
it.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
i
believe
that's
the
number.
it,
they
keep
raising
it.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
oh,
certainly.
certainly.
they
have--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
that's
another
thing
that
has
been
brought
up
in
those
decisions
such
as
eeoc
v.
vermont,
that
judges
can
always
be
appealed.
well,
judges
can
only
be
appealed
if
the
lawyers
take
it
upon
themselves
to
do
it.
i
think
that
is
unlike
the
executive
branch
in
many
regards,
and
most
particularly,
not
everybody
in
the
executive
branch
is
appointed
by
the
governor
and
has
to
run
for
retention
election
or
run
in
a
partisan
election.
these
judges
at
every
level
are
real
judges.
they
do
have
the
power,
the
judicial
power
of
the
state
of
missouri.
we
regard
them
as
important.
we
regard
them
as
state
officials
of
some
magnitude.
and
we
believe
that
the
congress
indicated,
in
its
use
of
terms
in
the
appointed
official
exemption,
that
it
understood
that
and
put
them
into
a
group
of
appointed
officials
in
the
policy-making
level
who
were
to
be
exempt
from
the
adea.
finally
i
will
just
touch
briefly
upon
the
constitutional
question,
the
equal
protection
matter.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
take
a
great
deal
of
time
to
struggle
with
the
cleburne
case.
i
think
that
case
is
clearly
understandable.
in
cleburne
the
situation
there
presented
no
rational
basis
upon
which
to
sustain
the
law
at
issue,
and
in
this
case
i
believe
that
we
have.
and
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
several
rational
bases.
but
for
purposes
of
the
case
let
me
just
suggest
that
the
most
important
of
those
rational
bases
is
the
availability
of
the
resources
that
this
orderly
attrition
creates
for
our
chief
justice
to
make
the
work
of
the
judiciary
go
forward,
the
fact
that
we
get
to
move,
by
that
attrition,
younger
members
of
the
profession
into
our
legal...
into
our
judiciary,
and
most
importantly
the
fact
that
we
are
able
to
correct--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--i
think
we
probably
could.
i
don't
see
where
we
would
want
to.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
most
of
the
judges--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
well,
that
might
be
a
little
too
fast.
most
of--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--we
have...
term
limitation
is
one
of
the
fears
that
we
have
that
come
out
of
this
case
if
the
petitioners
are
agreed
to.
we
kind
of
like
the
terms
that
our
judges
have
now.
they
are
nice
and
long,
and
they
have
that
super-incumbency
that
helps
them
out
a
great
deal
so
they're
not
always
out
campaigning
and
raising
money
and--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--we
could...
we
could
do
that
constitutionally,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
adea
would
certainly
prohibit
it.
we
already
have
a
term
limitation
on
our
governor
of
two
terms,
and--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--i
would
hope
not.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
to
conclude
with
what
i
was
saying
before,
the
main
feature
that
i
think
that
comes
out
of
the
missouri
plan,
at
least
in
the
last
20
years
since
the
mandatory
retirement
age
has
been
in
effect,
is
the
fact
that
we
have
done
a
very
good
job,
i
think,
of
being
able
to
promote
more
women,
more
minorities,
into
the
judiciary,
a
place
where
it
was
lacking
in
the
past.
we
have
had
under
this
very
defendant,
the
first
supreme
court,
female
supreme
court
justice
in
the
state's
history,
the
first
appellate
court
female
member
in
the
state's
history,
many
minority
and
female
members
of
the
courts
throughout
the
state--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--i
believe
that
perhaps
some
of
the
predecessors
were
not
trying
hard
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
well,
the
only
thing
that
jumps
out
at
me
is
that
in
the
statement
of
purposes
it
says
that
a
finding
that
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
i
don't
find
anything
that
is
that
clear
of
a
statement
concerning
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
therefore
i
would
conclude,
as
some
courts
have,
that
the
commerce
clause
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
adea
was
enacted.
i
think
that
perhaps
with
the
disposition
of
this
court's
rulings
between
national
league
of
cities
and
the
garcia
case,
i
have
noticed
a
decline
in
the
number
of
times
that
that
finding
has
been
necessary
to
be
made.
i
think
it
was
probably
an
issue
when
it
was
thought
important
to
avoid
the
reach
of
national
league
of
cities
in
order
to
not
have
the
adea
declared
unconstitutional.
but
since
1983,
in
particular
with
eeoc
v.
wyoming,
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
very
necessary
feature
to
declare
it
to
be
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
this
time.
in
conclusion,
then,
your
honors,
i
would
suggest
that
missouri
and
the
missouri
plan
are
a
model
for
appellate
and
trial
court
merit
judicial
selection.
it
has
been
widely
emulated.
it
is
something
that
we
cannot
for
the
life
of
us
see
why
the
federal
government
should
want
to
become
involved
in.
we
do
not
see
one
word
having
been
spoken
by
congress
indicating
an
intent
to
become
in
the
selection--
mr.
james
b.
deutsch
--i
would
prefer,
of
course,
that
you
say
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
would
accept
that
conclusion
without
those
precise
terms.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
