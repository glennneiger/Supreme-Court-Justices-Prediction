mr.
shoemake,
are
all
three
of
the
judges
involved
here,
have
they
been
retained
or
has
any
of
them
been
appointed?
justice
stevens
one
has
just
been
appointed
and
not
stood
for
retention
yet.
justice
stevens
they
all
have?
so
we
don't
have
before
us
a
judge
who
was
just
been
appointed
and
not
yet
retained?
justice
stevens
but
the
issue
would
clearly
apply
to
them
in
any
event?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
shoemake,
it
doesn't
say
or
an
appointee
who
is
a
policy
maker.
it
says
an
appointee
on
the
policy-making
level.
justice
stevens
does
that
not
mean
comparable
responsibility
or
comparable
salary
or
something
of
that
kind,
rather
than
that
the
person
must
be
a
policy
maker
himself
or
herself?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
for
example
in
salary
way
judges
are
paid
at
executive
lever...
level
2,
3,
or
4,
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
but
they
often
have
defined
judges
by
the
level
of...
for
certain
purposes
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
just
explain
why
the
word
"level"
isn't
critical
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
just
refresh
my
recollection.
they
are
appointees
of
the
governor,
are
they
not?
or
are
they
appointees--
justice
stevens
--who
is
an
elected
official.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
policy-making
point,
going
back
to
the
earlier
argument?
justice
stevens
i
understand
your
argument
about
changing
sovereign
immunity
and
major
changes
in
the
law
that
are
worked
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
but
the
average
trial
judge,
most
of
these
141
judges
are
not
members
of
the
supreme
court
and
do
not
independently
change
the
policy
on
sovereign
immunity.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
describe
the
average
trial
judge
as
being
a
policy
maker?
justice
stevens
well
supposing...
i
don't
know,
maybe
you
don't
have
something
like
our
sentencing
guidelines
in
the
federal
system.
they
were
rather
specific
sentences
required
to
be
imposed.
is
that
the
only
kind
of
policy
the...
i
mean,
is
there
any
other
area
in
which
you
say
the
trial
judge
makes
policy
other
than
sentencing?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
lowest
level
of
jurisdiction
that
the
judges
covered
in
this
category
have?
do
you
have
municipal
court
judges?
justice
stevens
associate
circuit.
what
sort
of
jurisdiction
do
they
have?
what
kind
of
policy
do
they
make?
justice
stevens
do
they
have
criminal
court
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
felony?
do
they
have
felony
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
and
it
is
a
full
time
job
for
them?
justice
stevens
on
that
argument
i
guess
you
could
justify
a
50-year
retirement
age,
couldn't
you?
justice
stevens
35?
how
about--
justice
stevens
--you
could
justify
a
35-year
retirement.
justice
stevens
why
not?
you'd
move
them
along
a
little
faster.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
because
that
would
not
be
discrimination
on
account
of
age.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
if
your
70-year-old
age
limit
causes
this
turnover,
you've
had
that
a
long
time.
why
did
it
take
so
long
to
get
a
female
judge?
