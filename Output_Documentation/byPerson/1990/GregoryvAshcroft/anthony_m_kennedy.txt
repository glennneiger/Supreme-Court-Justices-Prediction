justice
kennedy
well,
i
assume
the
governor
of
the
state
of
missouri
has
to
obey
the
state
constitution
and
the
common
law,
too,
doesn't
he?
justice
kennedy
no
official
is
completely
unrestrained
from
certain
minimal
rudiments
of
discretion.
justice
kennedy
well,
then
i
don't
see
how
your
distinction
is
persuasive.
justice
kennedy
it's
public
information
though,
i
think.
justice
kennedy
in
the
last
clause
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute,
do
you
interpret
the
phrase
"with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
or
legal
powers
of
the
office.
"
to
modify
just
immediate
advisor?
justice
kennedy
your
interpretation
would
be
more
sustainable
if
there
was
a
comma
after
the
word
"level",
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
sometimes
the
elimination
of
a
comma
is
designed
to
aid
us
in
the
construction,
and
in
this
case
it
would
indicate
that
the
final
clause
applies
and
modifies
both
appointee
and
advisor.
