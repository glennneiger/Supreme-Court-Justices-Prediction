mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
on
a
case
determining
the
validity
of
a
missouri
mandatory
retirement
provisions...
provision
for
state
court
judges.
the
issues
that
we
have
briefed
are
two.
one
is
whether
to
those
judges
in
missouri
who
are
appointed
to
office,
whether
or
not
they
are
covered
by
the
protections
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
with
regard
to
judges
in
missouri
who
are
elected
to
office,
we
have
maintained
that
the
mandatory
retirement
age
for
those
judges
violates
the
equal
protection
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
decision
below
by
the
eighth
circuit
was
that
with
regard
to
the
elect...
with
regard
to
the
appointed
judges,
they
were
not
covered
by
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
because
the
act
exempts
appointees
at
the
policy-making
level,
and
the
court
held
that
judges
in
missouri
are
policy
makers,
and
hence
not
covered
by
the
act.
the
eighth
circuit
also
ruled
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
the
mandatory
retirement
of
all
judges,
and
hence
did
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
mr.
chief
justice,
the
eighth
circuit
accepted
that
proposition,
but
i
must
say
in
fairness
there
was
a
sentence
which
indicated
if
that
issue
had
been
briefed
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
eighth
circuit
might
have
disagreed
with
that
finding.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
but
the
district
court
did
find
that
the
appointed
judges
were
not
elected
to
office,
they
are
appointed
to
office.
and
we
submit
that
is
the
correct
determination.
missouri--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--because
i
don't
believe
that
congress
wanted
to
be
looking
over
the
shoulder
of
the
voters
to
determine
the
motive
or
[inaudible]
intention
of
the
elected...
the
voters
as
to
what
motives
they
may
have
had
in
voting
for
elected
officials,
whether
those
elected
officials
were
judges
or
governors
or
legislators.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
the...
that
is
correct.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
ada
be
construed
broadly
and
that
the
exceptions
be
narrowly
construed.
and
i
think
that
when
the
ada
was
enacted
there
were
30
states
approximately
that
appointed
judges,
and
that
those
congressment
and
those
senators
who
voted
for
that
ada
were
fully
aware
that
it
may
cover
the
judges.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
ada
itself
which
indicates
whether
the
congress
intended
or
didn't
intend
to
include
or
exclude
the
judges.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
there
has
been
such
clear
intent
or
expression
by
the
congress,
because
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1974
it
was
amended
to
specifically
apply
to
states
and
political
subdivisions
as
employers.
and
that
would
be,
in
our
view,
the
state
of
missouri
is
an
employer
hence
covered
by
the
act,
and
that
a
judge
is
an
employee
and
hence
covered
by
the
protections
guaranteed
by
the
adea.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
should
be
read
to
reach
state
court
judges.
again
i
fall
back
on
the
fact
that
the
statute,
remedial
as
it
is,
was
to
be
construed
broadly.
and
clearly,
in
our
view,
had
congress
deemed
it
appropriate
to
exclude
judges,
as
it
excluded
elected
officials
and
those
on
the
elected
official's
personal
staff,
it
could
have
done
so.
and
it
did
not
do
so.
and
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
advocating
that
the
act
does
include
those
judges
even
if
in
so
construing
you
may
be
attempting
to
override
a
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
of
missouri.
in
missouri
we
have
two
selection
processes
for
the
judges.
the
supreme
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
trial
judges...
supreme
court
and
court
of
appeals
are...
are
selected
pursuant
to
the
missouri
non-partisan
court
plan,
as
are
all
judges
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
st.
louis
and
kansas
city.
everywhere
else
in
the
state
of
missouri
the
judges
are
elected.
there
is
a
greater
number
of
judges
who
is
elected...
who
are
elected
than
those
who
are
appointed.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
the...
the
language
when
the
missouri
plan
was
adopted
initially
applied
to
only
the
supreme
court
and
the
appellate
judges,
and
the
purpose
was
to
remove
partisan
politics
from
the
selection
of
judges.
and
then
there
was
later
an
amendment
to
provide
that
same
process
for
selection
to
the
city
of
st.
louis
and
kansas
city,
then
later
to
st.
louis
county,
which
is
a
contiguous
county
to
the
city
of
st.
louis.
and
there
was
some...
the
suggestion
is
there
was
some
resistance
in
the
rural
area
where
people
wanted
their
judges
to
be
elected
and
run
for
election.
and
on
the
election
process...
i'm
getting
a
little
ahead
of
myself...
judges
who
are
elected,
they
run
in
primaries
just
like
any
other
candidate
and
then
they
run
in
the
general
election.
judges
who
are
appointed,
supreme
court
judges
for
12
years
and
the
intermediate
levels
down
to
the
associate
circuit
judge
for
4
years,
when
their
terms
are
up,
or
when
it's
time,
they
don't
run
against
anybody.
in
fact,
the
missouri
constitution
prohibits
appointed
judges
from
engaging
in
politics
in
any
manner,
holding
any
office,
making
any
contribution,
or
supporting
any
candidate.
and
the
only
question
on
the
ballot
is
shall
judge
so-and-so
be
retained
in
office.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
he
has
to
get
the
votes,
or
he
has
to
be
voted
out
of
office.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
his
term
and
over,
and--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--if,
if
he's
not
voted
to
be
retained,
you
mean,
your
honor?
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
he's
on
the
ballot.
shall
judge
so-and-so
be
retained,
yes
or
no.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct.
but
it--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--the
reason
he
is
not
elected
is
the
foundation
for
the
missouri
plan
is
that...
first
of
all,
he's
not
elected
when
he
gets
his
office.
he
is
appointed.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
a
merit
selection
commission
appoints...
submits
three
names
to
the
governor.
the
governor
selects
one
of
them.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
no,
the
governor
cannot
give
him
another
term.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
but
the
process,
we
submit,
as
we
have
in
our
briefs,
of
retention
or
nonretention
is
like
a
question
on
the
ballot,
and
not
like
one
for--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--we
submit
that
issue
is
not
here,
although
the
state
has
argued
that.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
one
has--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--oh,
these
judges?
oh,
i
see.
no,
these
judges
have
been
retained.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
but...
in
missouri,
under
the
missouri
non-partisan
court
plan
permits
effective
date,
now
some...
there
was
one
judge
who
was
grandfathered
in,
but
from
the
effective
date,
there
has
never
been
a
judge
who
has
been
failed
to
be
retained
in
office.
there
was
one
judge
in
kansas
city
who
was
an
elected
judge,
was
grandfathered
in,
and
when
it
was
time
for
retention
he
was
not
retained.
but
those
who
have
been
appointed,
there
is
not
a
single
incidence
of
any
of
those
judges
who
have
not
been
retained
in
office.
we
submit
that
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
adea,
it's
best
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
discussions
that
went
on
in
the
amendment
to
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
which
contains
the
same
language
and
the
same
exemptions
about
elected
officials
and
so
forth.
in
that
it
was
clear
that
what
the
congress
was
intending
was
to
exempt
an
elected
official
and
that
elected
official's
team,
his
personal
staff,
his
legal
advisors,
those
who
made
policy
for
him.
in
fact
the
example
is
such
as
cabinet
officers
and
persons
with
comparable
responsibilities
in
talking
about
policy
making.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i...
that's--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--they
have
to
be
serving
that
officer.
in
fact--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--well,
because
they
wanted
that
elected
official
to
be
able
to
have
those
persons
who
were
going
to
serve
him
and
generate
the
policy
that
he
stands
for,
or
attempt
to,
for
which
he
was
elected,
to
be
able
to
serve
him
and
be
exempt
from
the
act.
in
fact,
in
the
national
league
of
cities,
while
the
language
is
a
little
different,
the
opinion
talks
about,
in
construing
those
exemptions,
talks
about...
the
language
is
serving
such
an
office
holder.
those
persons
who
are
exempt
are
exempt
because
they
are
serving
such
an
office
holder.
we
submit
the
judges
in
missouri
aren't
serving
the
appointing
office
holder.
they
are
independent
judges,
and
they
remain
independent.
and
the
statutory
construction,
again,
is
borrowed
time
and
time
again
by
the
courts
from
the
1972
amendments
as
it
relates
to
title
vii,
wherein
there
the
discussion
was
what
kinds
of
exemptions
were
to
be
included.
and
there
was
only
one
mention...
there
is
no
mention
in
the
reports
itself
or
themselves
about
exempting
judges.
the
only
mention
is
in
some
senate,
senate
debate,
one
time.
senator
irvin
from
north
carolina
used
the
word
"judge",
at
that
time
describing
the
governor,
the
chief
justice,
and
at
the
time
he
was
doing
it
all
judges
in
north
carolina
were
elected.
so
there
was
no
mention
about
appointed
judges.
the
judges,
we
submit,
do
not
fall
within
the
exemption
of
being
appointees
at
the
policy-making
level.
and
my
emphasis
is
on
level.
we
think
that's
an
unnatural
construction
of
words
as
they
are
used
in
the
federal
system
by
congress
when
it
refers
to
those
who
are
appointees
at
the
policy-making
level.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
well,
what
i
said
on
the
elected
official's
staff,
if
i
limited
it
to
that
i
misspoke,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
those
who
are
normally
recognized
as
persons
who
make
policy.
and
the
example
used
was
such
as
cabinet
officers
and
persons
with
comparable
responsibilities
at
the
local
level.
now,
i'm
reading
from
the
conference
report
on
the
amendment
to
title
vii
but,
again,
that
language
has
been
used
in
construing
the
adea
which
has
the
precise
same
exemptions.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
it's
disjunctive,
so
i
think
it
would
be
independent
of
that
phrase,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
judges
in
missouri,
we
submit,
as
the
second
circuit
found
in
eeoc
v.
vermont,
may
incidentally
make
policy,
but
their
basic
function
is
to
decide
legal
disputes.
they
may
fill
in
gaps,
they
may
do
other
things,
but
the
judges...
and
they
regulate
the
bar,
pass
rules
for
the
bar
and
for
the
courts,
the
supreme
court
does.
but
their
basic
function
is
to
resolve
legal
matters.
and--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--yes,
there
is,
justice
white.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
they
do
keep
developing
the
common
law
in
missouri.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
they
do.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that,
justice
white.
there
may
be
some
policy
connected
with...
but
before
they
engage
in
that,
whatever,
there
has
to
be
a
case
or
controversy
in
front
of
that
court.
and
whatever
the
court
does,
generally,
there
may
be
some
exceptions
that
i
am
unaware
of,
there
are
going
to
be
certain
parameters
in
which
that
court
operates,
maybe
in
the
context
of
the
constitution
or
the
common
law.
but
that's
where
the
court
is.
it
has
a
context
in
which
it
makes
those
judgments.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
he
is.
but
again--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--well,
the
distinction
is
the
judges
in
missouri
don't
make
policy,
for
example,
that...
the
policy
will
be
that
we're
only
going
to
allow
public
service
companies
to
come
for
rate
increases
every
3
years.
that's
going
to
be
the
policy
we're
going
to
develop.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
we
do.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
those
people
are
appointed.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
it
would
be
our
view
that
those
who
are
the
head
of
those
agencies,
such
as
the
public
service
commission
who
may
generate
policy,
could
well
be
unprotected.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
if
their
appointments
are
for
a
number
of
years,
3
years,
4,
then
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
that
they
are
unprotected.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
those
judges
who
are
appointed.
those
judges
who
are
appointed
to
office.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
well,
the
plain
language
of
what
congress
meant,
as
we
read
it,
is
they
meant
on
the
policy-making
level.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
and--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
think
that
is
the
critical
word.
the
word
level
is
what
is
critical.
i
think
what
we
submit
the
court
must
look
to
is
what
did
the
congress
mean
using
the
word
level,
not
policy
maker,
but
policy-making
level.
and
again,
harkening
to
the
conference
report
on
the
amendments
to
title
vii,
and
the
only
examples
that
we've
had
as
to
what
was
meant
at
the
policy-making
level,
it
said
such
as
cabinet
officers
and
other
comparable
responsibilities
at
the
local
level.
and
we
submit
that
in
using
that,
the
federal
congress,
the
congress,
intended
it
to
be
those
that
the
congress
generally
recognizes
as
those
who
reach
a
level
where
they
make
policy.
and
that
would
be,
in
our
judgment,
those
such
as
the
example
here,
the
cabinet,
and
not
to
the
judges.
there
has
never...
there
is
no...
ever
any
example
or
suggestion
given
that
it
would
be
appointed
judges.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
yes,
it
did.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
it
does
not...
under
certain
circumstances
it
does,
but
generally
it
does
not.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
it
was.
as
was--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
think
that
would
be...
the
tougher
question
of
whether
that's
policy
making,
i'd
have
to
say
it
is,
but
within
the
context
of
a
matter
of
a
dispute
that
comes
before
it.
i
don't
think
they
start
out
to
say
our
policy
is
going
to
be
henceforth
as
a
court
that
there
is
no
immunity
for
charitable
institutions.
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
case
or
controversy
in
which
they
discuss
prior
cases,
prior
precedent.
we've
just
had
the
change
in
missouri
recently
from
contributory
negligence
as
a
defense
to
the
one
of
comparative
fault.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
would
say
that
those
who
are
appointed--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--um-hum.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
would
have
to
say
in
my
mind,
in
my
example,
they're
still
unprotected.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
unprotected.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
because
they
make
that
judgment.
that
is
their
policy.
they
make
that
judgment
that
that's
the
way
this
regulates...
regulating
body
is
going
to
operate.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
correct.
but
again,
the
difference...
if
the
regulator,
the
public
service
commission
in
missouri
which
regulates,
obviously,
the
public
service
company,
if
it
says
from
now
on
we're
just
going
to
follow
the
rules
and
we're
not
going
to
enact...
that
have
already
been
established,
we're
not
going
to
enact
new
rules,
that,
in
my
judgment
that's
policy.
that's
a
policy
decision
that
they
make.
and
there's
no
case
or
controversy
in
front
of
them
at
the
time.
it's
just
a
judgment
that
they
make
as
a
matter
of
policy,
those
who
have
been
appointed
to
those
policy-making
positions
by
the
governor.
if
i
may,
there
are
judges
in
missouri
who
are
elected.
they
are
the
only
officials
in
the
state
government
of
missouri
who
have
to
mandatorily
retire
at
70
who
are
in
nonphysically
demanding
jobs,
not
legislators,
not
the
governor,
not
the
librarian,
not
the
janitor.
only
judges
have
to
retire
at
70.
and
we
recognize
this
court's
pronouncement
that
age
is
not
a
suspect
class,
and
that
if
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
upholding
that
classification
we
lose.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
requiring
judges
to
retire
and
not
requiring
any
other
employee
in
the
state
of
missouri
to
retire.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
would
not...
that
was
never
an
articulated
rational
basis
for
missouri--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
would...
i
don't
think
we
can
guess,
justice
scalia,
as
to
what
the
rational--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--as
to
what...
well,
missouri
has
articulated
in
the
supreme
court
case
as
to
what
the
rational
bases
were.
in
my...
you
asked
me,
in
my
experience,
having
come
from
a
rural
area
in
missouri,
in
many
instances
there
is
no
more
hotly
contested
election
than
for
the
circuit
judgeships
that
cover
three
or
four
counties,
and
what
that
judge
has
done
and
not
done
is
brought
to
the
public's
attention
by
his
opponent
time
and
time
and
time...
his
or
her
opponent,
time
and
time
again.
so
i
do
believe
the
electorate
is
fully
informed,
maybe
more
so
than
most
elections
as
to
what
the
circuit
judges
who
are
elected
in
missouri
are
doing.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
moving
on
to
my
equal
protection
argument
that
to
require
those
judges,
all
judges
in
missouri,
including
the
elected
judges,
to
retire
at
70
violates
the
equal
protection
guarantees--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--well--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--it
seems
to
me...
no,
they're
not
contested
at
all.
those
are
appointed.
they
have
no
opponent,
they
are
not
contested
at
all.
it's
just
simply
on
the
ballot
shall
judge
so-and-so
be
retained.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
there
are
those--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--as
existed
in
california,
i
recognize
those
cases.
but
again,
those
citizens,
instead
of
being
uninformed,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--there
have
been
substantial
votes.
my
recollection
is
in...
is
in
the
st.
louis
area
where
i
live
that
the
retentions
range
all
the
way
from
60-some
percent
on
up.
and
there
is
not--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
that
is
not
in
the
record,
justice
marshall.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
it's
public
in...
i
probably
should
have.
but
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
we
submit
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
requiring
only
judges,
even
those
who
are
elected,
to
retire,
because
one
of
the
rational
bases
stated
is
that
the
supreme
court
in
missiouri,
when
it
wrote
the
o'neil
opinion
in
1976,
said
we
all
recognize
that
70
is
about
an
age...
is
about
the
time
when
physical
and
mental
deterioration
commences.
the
studies
are
all
contrary
to
that
as
far
as
mental
abilities
are
concerned.
the
announcement
that
it
made
for
ease
in
administering
a
pension
plan
doesn't
change
that
pension
plan
any
different
than
any
other
pension
plans
for
those
officials
in
the
state
of
missouri.
the
articulation
that
it
opens
up
opportunities
for
young
members
of
the
bar,
no
different
than
opening
up
opportunities
for
other
members
or
for
other
segments
of
the
population.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
with
the
circuit
judges
it's
a
6-year
election
in
missouri,
for
those
who
are
elected.
those
who
are
retained
as
circuit
judges,
it's
6
years.
associate
judges
are
4
years.
justice
gregory
is
an
associate--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--8
and
12,
your
honor.
12
years
for,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
supreme
court.
but
that,
in
my
view,
that
same
rationale,
that
same
argument
if
advanced
would
be
applicable
to
the
others,
the
governors,
the
legislators,
the
senate,
the
house,
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
shorter
terms
than
the
appellate
judges.
yes,
they
certainly
do.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--no.
i
do
not
think
it's
unconstitutional
in
exempting
elected
officials.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
that--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
don't
recall
doing
it.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
under
the
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
the
ada
is
a
specific...
you
mean
is
it,
would
i
argue
it's
unconstitutional
for
the,
that
the
ada
exempted
elected
officials?
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
would
not
argue
that.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
i
would
not.
thank
you.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
appointed
judges
when
they
stand
for
retention
are
elected
to
office,
the
missouri
constitution
provides
that,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
subchapter,
all
candidates
for
elective
office
shall
be
nominated
at
a
primary
election.
and
these
appointed
judges
do
not
do
that.
they
do
not
run
in
a
primary
election.
that
is
the
constitutional
requirement.
all
candidates
for
elective
office
shall
be
nominated
at
primary--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--i
think
it's
significant
in
that...
it's
not...
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
appointed
judges
are
elective
and
hence
exempt
from
the
coverage
under
the
adea.
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
well,
justice
souter,
i
submit
it
goes
a
little
farther
in
that
it
shows
that
those
who
have...
how
they're
dressed
as
elected
officials,
these
appointed
judges
do
not
wear
that
clothing.
they
are
different.
they
are
retained
in
office.
with
regard
to
the
interpretation,
finally,
that
congress
did
not
exclude
or
include
judges,
that
is
true.
what
the
congress
did
was
to
say
that
the
statute
shall
be
construed
broadly,
and
that
any
exemptions
shall
be
construed
narrowly.
and
finally,
the--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--that's
in
the
conference
report
relating
to--
mr.
jim
j.
shoemake
--no,
it
is
not
in
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
and
finally,
the
age
discrimination
act
in
its
introductory
remarks
talks
about
the...
the
arbitrary
discrimination
on
age.
that's
what
it's
designed
to
rectify.
and
we
submit
that
these
judges
in
missouri
are
being
arbitrarily
discriminated
against
simply
because
they
are
70
years
of
age.
no
further
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
