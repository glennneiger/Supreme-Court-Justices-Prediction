justice
o'connor
why...
why
do
you
suppose
congress
would
have
wanted
to
exclude
from
the
adea
elected
judges
but
not
appointed
judges?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
missouri
selects
its
judges
pursuant
to
constitutional
provisions
in
the
state
of
missouri?
justice
o'connor
state
constitutional
provisions.
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
it's
sufficiently
clear
that
congress
intended
to
override
these
state
constitutional
provisions
without
ever
making
clear
that
intent?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
when
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
preemption
of
a
state
constitutional
provision
of
this
significance
to
the
state,
that
we
should
look
for
a
clear
expression
of
intent
by
congress,
not
something
that
just
appears
never
to
have
even
been
considered?
justice
sandra

o'connor
the
second
case
which
i
announce
is
gregory
against
ashcroft,
no.
90-50.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
missouri
state
judges
who
challenge
a
provision
in
the
missouri
state
constitution
calling
for
the
mandatory
retirement
of
all
state
judges
at
age
70.
petitioners
contend
that
this
provision
violates
the
federal
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
we
hold,
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
that
the
missouri
mandatory
retirement
provision
is
valid
as
against
both
challenges.
this
case
concerns
a
state
constitutional
provision
through
which
the
people
of
missouri
establish
a
qualification
for
those
who
sit
as
their
judges.
this
is
a
decision
of
the
most
fundamental
sort
for
a
sovereign
state.
through
the
structure
of
its
government
and
the
character
of
those
who
exercise
government
authority,
a
state
defines
itself
as
a
sovereign.
for
congress
to
interfere
with
this
decision
would
upset
the
constitutional
balance
of
federal
and
state
powers.
we
will
not
likely
assume
that
congress
has
intended
to
upset
this
balance.
consequently,
in
such
a
case,
we
will
not
read
a
federal
statute
as
usurping
state
authority,
unless
congress
has
stated
plainly
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
it
intends
such
intrusion.
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
does,
plainly
cover
state
employees.
it
just
as
plainly
excludes
from
its
coverage
certain
important
state
government
officials.
in
particular,
the
act
excludes
elected
officials
and
their
appointees
on
the
policy
making
level.
petitioners
in
this
case
were
appointed
to
office
by
the
governor
of
missouri
an
elected
official.
the
governor
contends
that
the
petitioners
are
appointees
on
the
policy
making
level
and,
therefore,
exempt
from
the
federal
act's
coverage.
one
can
fairly
debate
whether
judges
make
policy
in
the
sense
intended
by
congress
in
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act,
but
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
plainly
excludes
most
important
state
officials,
a
term
appointee
on
the
policy
making
level
is
sufficiently
broad
that
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
statute
plainly
covers
appointed
state
judges.
therefore,
by
applying
the
plain
statement
rule,
we
conclude
that
it
does
not.
we
also
conclude
that
the
missouri
mandatory
retirement
provision
is
valid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
age
is
not
a
suspect
classification
under
that
clause.
petitioners
assert
no
fundamental
interest
in
serving
its
judges,
and
the
state
need
only
demonstrate
a
rational
basis
for
the
retirement
provision
in
order
for
it
to
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny.
and
we
conclude
for
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion
that
there
is
such
a
rational
basis.
the
judgment

the
