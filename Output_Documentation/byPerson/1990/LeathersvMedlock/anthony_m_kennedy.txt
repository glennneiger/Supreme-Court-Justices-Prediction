justice
kennedy
well,
is
that
because
they
don't
compete?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
we
can
tell
when...
you
can
read
a
newspaper,
and
you
watch
a
television
screen.
they're
dissimilar
in
that...
in
that
respect.
but
for
purposes
of
our
determining
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment,
can't
we
say
that
these
media
are
in
competition?
i
take
it
cable
offers
a
wide
variety
of
news
broadcasts
in
arkansas,
including
24-hour
news,
i
suppose,
on
some
channels?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
didn't
the
arkansas
supreme
court
say
that
there
was
no
competition
between
the
two,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
i
thought
the
arkansas
supreme
court
said
well,
we...
they're
not
really
competing
in
the
same
way.
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
was
that
based
on
some
factual
findings?
justice
kennedy
could
the
state
tax
magazine
subscriptions
and
not
newspapers?
justice
kennedy
on
the
grounds
that
we
say
they're
different?
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
show...
suppose
it
is
shown
that
they
compete
for
the
same
consumer
dollar?
i'm
not
sure
you
can
make
that
showing,
but
suppose
that
showing
were
made
in
a
particular
case?
justice
kennedy
would
that
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
they
are
different,
or
is
that
just
something
we
don't
look
to?
justice
kennedy
we
look
to
some
metaphysical
difference
between
newspapers
and
magazines,
and
metaphysical
difference
is
fairly
easy
to
establish,
i
suppose.
justice
kennedy
what
about
telephone
services?
i
take
it
now
that
if
you
dial,
i
don't
know
if
it's
800
or
900,
there
are
all
sorts
of
information
services,
sports,
news,
and
so
forth,
that
you
get
on
the
telephone.
is
that...
does
the
state
have
to
have
a
compelling
interest
before
it
can
tax
the
telephone
service
company
if
it
exempts
your
industry?
justice
kennedy
well,
we
have
to
write
the
opinion,
and
we
want
to
know
the
consequences
of
the
theory
that
you're
advancing.
can
you,
can
you
answer
this
question?
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
the
consequences
are
they're
engaged
in
dissemination
of
information
and
that
they
qualify
for
the
exemption.
justice
kennedy
because
i
can
think
of
no
case
in
which
we...
in
which
a
state
has
been
able
to
show
a
compelling
interest,
of
course
we
have
never
asked
them
to
do
so,
but
i
can't
think
of
how
a
state
could
show
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
any
tax
exemption
or
any
tax
discrimination.
