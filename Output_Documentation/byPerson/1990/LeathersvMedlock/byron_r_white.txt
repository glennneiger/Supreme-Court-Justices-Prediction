justice
white
is
the
satellite
issue
still
in
the
case?
justice
white
the
law
has
been
amended?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
but
you
would
still
like
to
argue
that
it
was
not
invalid
prior
to
amendment?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
the
legislature
might
go
back,
if
you
want.
justice
white
in
arkansas,
what
do...
what
public
property
does
the...
do
the
cable
companies
use?
justice
white
do
they
use
telephone
poles?
justice
white
well,
on
that
instance
i
suppose
you
could
have
taxed
the
press
and
exempted
cable?
justice
white
but
it's
also
a
state
sales
tax,
isn't
it?
justice
white
that
applies
not
just
to
the
press,
i
mean
not
just
to
the
media--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
so
the
real
issue
is
whether
you
can
distinguish
between
one
form
of
communication
and
another?
justice
white
what's
the...
in
the
cases,
what
is
the
standard
that
has
been
applied
that,
sustaining
the
right
of
localities
to
license
cable
operators
but
to
exempt
newspapers
from
license?
just
a
rational
basis?
justice
white
well,
i
see
that
in
your
brief
you
refer
to
cases
since
minneapolis
star,
and
you
say,
these
courts
have
held
that
unless
there
is
some
logical
reason
for
distinguishing
between
different
segments
of
the
mass
communications
media,
cable
television
services
should
enjoy
the
same
first
amendment
rights.
is
that
your
standard...
logical?
justice
white
you
mean
logical
is
at
least
compelling?
justice
white
but
the
discrimination
is
not...
there's
no
discrimination
between
cable
and
other
retail
businesses?
justice
white
so
i
suppose
the
state,
in
your
view,
could
solve
the
problem
either
way,
by
extending
the
tax
or
exempting
cable?
justice
white
would
they
need
some
kind
of
a
compelling
interest
to
include
all
of
the
media
in
the
sales
tax?
justice
white
and
why
should
the
exemption
of
the
press
be
subject
to...
the
exemption
of
newspapers
be
subject
to
a
compelling
interest
if
taxing
all
of
the
press
would
not
require
a
compelling
interest?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
congressional
decision
to
subject
cable
to
licensing
is
constitutional?
justice
white
no,
no.
just
generally.
justice
white
oh,
yeah,
yeah.
justice
white
how
about
is
it
constitutional...
does
the
first
amendment
interfere
with
that
decision
by
congress?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
congress
really
needed
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
interest
to
subject
cable
to
licensing
but
not
newspapers?
justice
white
what
are
they?
justice
white
what
is
the
compelling
interest?
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
applying
the
sales
tax
can
be
justified
as
a...
on
that
basis?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
so
it's
all
right
for
the
municipalities
in
arkansas
to
permit
the
use
of
sidewalks,
public
sidewalks,
for
news
boxes
without
charge?
isn't
that
a
subsidy?
justice
white
and
a
permissible
one?
justice
white
but
they
don't.
but
they
charge
cable.
justice
white
well,
arguably,
i
suppose
the,
changing
the
law
made
the
exemption
of
newspapers
even
more
difficult,
because
satellites
don't
use
the...
a
satellite
doesn't
use...
don't
use
the
streets
and
put
any
burden
on
the
public
like
the...
like
the
cable
operators
do.
justice
white
and
yet,
and
yet
newspapers
are
exempt
and
satellite
are
not.
justice
white
well,
what
about
between
satellites
and
the
newspapers?
justice
white
well,
they
are
different.
justice
white
what
has
that
got
to...
how
is
that
relevant
to
taxation?
justice
white
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
