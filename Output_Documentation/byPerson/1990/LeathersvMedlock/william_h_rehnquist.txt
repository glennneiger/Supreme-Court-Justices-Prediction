we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-29,
james
c.
pledger
v.
daniel
medlock,
and
90-38,
daniel
medlock
v.
james
c.
pleasure...
pledger,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
keadle.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
mr.
keadle,
said
that
the
tax
was
invalid
insofar
as
it
applied
to
cable
tv
operators
but
did
not
extend
to
satellite
dish
operators?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you're
appealing--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you're
appealing
that
ruling?
and
then
you're
defending
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
when
it
held
that
it
was
not
invalid
to
distinguish
between
cable
operators
and
newspapers?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
say
that
the
statute
in
effect
before
the
legislative
amendment
went
into
effect
was
constitutional,
the
state
would
recover
some
money,
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
so
that,
that
is
the
tangible
dispute,
whether
the
state
has
to
refund
taxes
that
it
collected?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
keadle.
mr.
sayre,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sayre,
if
you
say
that
a
compelling
state
interest
is
required
in
order
to
have
a
tax
that
distinguishes
between
types
of
media,
you're
going
from
what
was
the
standard
before
minneapolis
star,
which
was
that
any
rational
basis
would
support
a
tax
distinction,
you
know,
lenhouse
v....
and
those
cases,
that
that
was
where
the
latitude
awarded
to
the
government
was
the
greatest,
to
a
situation
where
the
government
can
virtually
never
prevail.
you
say
that's
the
import
of
minneapolis
star?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
why
would
it
be
so
limited?
we
had
a
case
involving
nude
dancing
here
yesterday,
as
to
whether
that
was
communicative.
now,
would
a
state
have
to
tax
the
bookstore
that
was
presenting
the
nude
dancing
the
same
way
it
taxed
other
forms
of
communicative
activity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sayre,
the
members
of
the
court
should
be
addressed
as
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sayre.
mr.
keadle,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
5
minutes
left.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
keadle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
leathers
and
medlock,
and
medlock
against
leathers
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
