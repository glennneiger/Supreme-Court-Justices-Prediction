justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
don't
the
newspapers
use
public
property
to
sell
their
newspapers?
justice
stevens
then
how...
what
happens
to
your
distinction?
justice
stevens
of
course
they
pay
for
the
franchises,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
the
newspapers
don't
pay
anything
for
the
newsstands
on
public
property?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
administration
of
a
sales
tax
on
newspapers
probably
isn't
any
harder
than
sales
tax
on
candy
bars,
is
it?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
sayre,
i
think...
i'm
really
not
sure
you're
answering
justice
scalia.
suppose
you
reversed
the
situation
and
said
the
tax
applied
to
sales
of
all
tangible
property,
and
therefore
newspapers
are
subject
to
tax,
but
cable
would
not
be
because
they
don't
sell
anything
tangible.
would
that
be
constitutional
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
just
running
through
my
mind
as
a
result
of
one
the
chief
justice
asked
you?
supposing
a
state
imposed
an
amusement
tax
on
motion
picture
theaters,
but
did
not
impose
a
similar
tax
on
your
clients.
would
that
be
valid?
justice
stevens
so
tax
on
the...
i'm
talking
about
theaters
exhibiting
motion
pictures.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
i
think
your
distinction...
i
mean
your
argument
that
the
press
and
cable
tv
are
similarly
protected
would
apply
equally
to
cable
tv
and
motion
picture
theaters.
justice
stevens
and
you
can
think
of
no
compelling
interest,
can
you,
for
that
distinction?
