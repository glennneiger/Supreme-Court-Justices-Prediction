justice
scalia
mr.
keadle,
what,
what
is
your
theory
of
the
law?
do
you
acknowledge
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
to
tax
differentially
two
media
that
are
in
competition
with
one
another?
that
the
test
is
whether
they
are
competing,
and
if
they
are
competing,
you
cannot
tax
one
differently
from
the
other?
is
that
a--
justice
scalia
--proposition
you
accept?
justice
scalia
well,
what
is
it?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
well,
what
is
the
criterion,
if
it's
not
that?
i
mean,
that
one
i
understand.
what
is
it
if
it's
not
that?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
a
difference
between
the
two,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
differences
between
the
two.
so
i...
is
what
you're
saying
is
that,
as
with
any
other
tax,
a
rational
basis
distinction
between
the
two
is
enough
to
support
a
differential
tax?
justice
scalia
so
it's
just
the
same
test
that
applies
to
all
taxation?
there
has
to
be
a
rational
basis
between
the
two,
you
say,
so
long
as
you're
not
discriminating
on
a
subject
matter
basis?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
what
about
a
tax
on
ink
and
typesetting?
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
surely
there
was
a
rational
basis
to
distinguish
publishers
from
other
people.
i
mean,
they're
different
from
other
people
in
a
lot
of
ways.
they
put
different
burdens
on
the
state's
economy,
and
so
forth.
wasn't
there
a
rational
basis
there
to
distinguish
between?
i
mean,
i
want
to
tax
ink,
and
i
don't
want
to
tax
non-ink.
ink
is
different
from
non-ink.
justice
scalia
but
we
struck
it
down
anyway.
justice
scalia
in
other
words
a
group
within
an
entity
that
was
competing
with
each
other.
so
we're
right
back
where
you
say
we
aren't.
justice
scalia
pardon?
justice
scalia
the
same
as
opposed
to
competing?
the
same
in
what
sense?
justice
scalia
they're
different
newspapers.
justice
scalia
so
in
one-half
of
the
case
it
depends
on
whether
scrambled
television
systems
are
really
the
same
media
as
unscrambled
television
systems,
is
that's
your
criterion,
right?
that's
the
question
before
us,
whether
they
are
like
two
different
newspapers
or
not?
justice
scalia
mr.
keadle,
i
suppose
the
state
of
arkansas
can
impose
a
tax
on
candy
and
not
impose
a
tax
on
ice
cream
if
it
wanted
to,
couldn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
that
candy
used
public
facilities
or
the
public
streets
more
than
ice
cream
or
anything
of
that
sort?
justice
scalia
you'd
just
come
up
here
and
you'd
say
candy
is
different
from
ice
cream,
right?
justice
scalia
so
why...
what
you're
saying
today
is
that
cable
is
different
from
scrambled...
un...
you
know--
justice
scalia
--well,
i
understand,
but
what
i
don't
get
from
you,
what
i
don't
understand
is
what
your
theory
is.
do
you
acknowledge
that
in
order
to
make
a
distinction
between
two
media,
a
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest?
do
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
scalia
well,
if
it's
not
a
compelling
state
interest
that
has
to
be
shown,
what
must
be
shown
beyond
what
has
to
be
shown
in
the
candy
and
ice
cream
illustration?
anything
other
than
the
two
things
are
different
and
we
chose
to
tax...
choose
to
tax
the
one
and
not
the
other?
justice
scalia
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
magazines.
you
can
certainly
distinguish
that
case
on
that
ground.
this
is
not
a
subject
matter
distinction.
justice
scalia
does
it
constitute
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
that
has
to
have
a
compelling
justification
if
the
type
of
tax
at
issue,
although
it's
applied
uniformly
to
anyone,
is
simply
a
tax
that
does
not
happen
to
fall
on
one
of
the
media?
let's
assume...
well,
a
sales
tax.
let's
assume
that
most
of
the
broadcasters
in
arkansas
don't
sell
their
advertising
locally,
that
the
sales
are
made
by
the
networks
to
nationwide
advertisers
and
what
not,
so
that
the
over-the-air
broadcasters
in
arkansas
really
don't
make
any
sales
to
people.
now,
would
a
uniform
sales
tax
that
applies
to
newspapers,
cable
owners,
and
everybody
else,
but
that
happens
not
to
bite
the
over-the-air
broadcaster
because
he
is
not
selling
anything
in
arkansas,
is
that
kind
of
a
tax
unconstitutional,
too,
because
it
has
this--
justice
scalia
--no,
i
understand
that--
justice
scalia
--no,
but
i'm
trying
to
test
the
breadth
of
the
principle
you're
urging
us
to
adopt.
is
the
principle
that
you
have
to
treat
all
media
equally,
or
is
it
just
that
you
can't
make
an
exemption
from
a
particular
tax
for
some
media
and
not
for
others?
but
so
long
as
you
design
your
tax
correctly
so
that
it
happens
to
hit
some
of
them
and
not
others,
that's
okay?
justice
scalia
mr.
sayre,
suppose
a
state
says,
suppose
we
come
out
the
way
you
want
and
the
state
says
gee,
we
can't
tax
these
media
differentially.
what
we'll
do
instead
is
we'll
subsidize
some
of
them
and
not
subsidize
others.
is
that
okay?
can
you,
can
a
state
subsidize
media
differentially?
justice
scalia
it
isn't?
i
mean,
to
give
public
money,
let's
say
public
broadcasting
is,
is
an
example
where
the
federal
government
and
maybe
some
states
subsidize
television
and
radio,
but
don't
subsidize
public
newspapers.
is
that
unconstitutional?
and
if
not,
why
not?
i
can't
understand
what's
the
difference
between
giving
them
a
subsidy
and
declining
to
impose
a
tax.
is
there
any
real
difference?
justice
scalia
you're
saying
the
state
has
a
good
reason.
the
state
always
has
a
good
reason.
it
has
a
good
reason
for
giving
tax
exemptions,
too.
it
wants
to
foster
cable,
which
is
a
useful
medium
for
the
state
for
emergencies
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
well...
but
you
say
there's
a
difference
between
subsidy
and
tax?
justice
scalia
mr.
sayre,
could
arkansas
exempt
not-for-profit
organizations
from
its
sales
tax?
not-for-profit
newspapers,
let's
say,
church
newspapers
and
things
of
that--
justice
scalia
--it
does?
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
that
all
right?
justice
scalia
well,
they're
selling
the
newspaper,
but
what
they
get
from
it
just
covers
their
costs
of
production.
but
they
are
exacting
a
charge
for
it.
justice
scalia
that's
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
scalia
why
doesn't
that
offend
the
principle
of
freedom
of
the
press?
i
mean,
the
principle
of
freedom
of
the
press
is
not
to...
is
not
meant
to
assure
that
everybody
makes
the
same
amount
of
profit.
that's
not
what
it's
for.
justice
scalia
it's
to
ensure
open
discussion.
what's
the
difference
whether
the
discussion
is
by
a
not-for-profit
organization
or
a
profit
organization?
