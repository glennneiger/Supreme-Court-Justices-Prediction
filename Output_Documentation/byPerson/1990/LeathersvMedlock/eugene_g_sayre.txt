mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
first
state
the
theory
of
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
operators
and
subscribers
to
summarize
the
relief
that
we
seek
and
then
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case.
first,
the
theory
is,
as
enunciated
in
this
court's
minneapolis
star
case,
that
if
we
have
a
differential
of
taxation
between
different
forms
of
the
media,
then,
even
though
the
court
said
that
it
does
not
in
essence
make
such
a
compelling
force
on
the
speaker
that
it
totally
keeps
them
from
speaking
at
the
time,
that
that
presence
and
the
threat
of
future
differential
taxation
is
such
that
it
puts
a
burden
on
the
state
to
show
a
higher
or
the
compelling
interest.
and
in
this
particular
case
we
believe
that
the
taxpayers
and
the
cable
operators
have
sufficiently
established
that
the
method
of
delivering
news
information
and
entertainment
by
the
cable
electronic
message
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
that
is
delivered
in
the
print,
either
newspapers
or
magazines,
and
in
fact
the
trial
court
stated
that
our
witnesses
referred
to
this
as
an
electronic
magazine.
now
the
method,
or
the
relief
that
we're
seeking
is
a
reversal
of
the
latter
part
of
the
decision
and
an
affirmance
of
the
first
part.
as
mr.
keadle
said,
the
arkansas
supreme...
legislature
amended
the
law
because
we
had
established
at
the
trial
in
this
case
that
the
direct
broadcast
satellite,
or
the
scrambled
services,
were
not
being
taxed
and
were
delivering
exactly
the
same
type
of
information,
news
and
entertainment,
virtually
identical,
to
the
cable
that
was
taxed,
that
for
that
2-year
period
the
tax
was
unconstitutional
under
this
court's
minneapolis
star
and
arkansas
writer's
project
rationale.
however,
we
have
never
had
an
opportunity
in
the
second
stage
of
the
case
to
present
any
evidence
to
attack
that,
because
it
was
after
the
trial
court's
decision.
we
believe
if
this
court
will
accept
the
broader
approach
that
we
have
suggested,
and
that
is
that
print
and
the
cable
are
similar,
sufficiently
similar,
that
the
same
tax
should
be
applied
to
the
same
or
they
are
unconstitutional
without
a
compelling
interest
being
shown
by
the
state,
then
you
should
reverse
the
arkansas
supreme
court
on
the
approval
of
the
second
or
amended
law.
however,
even
if
you
find
that
only
the
electronic
media
is
similar
and
that
we
should
narrow
the
approach
or
the
look
to
those
particular
entities,
we
have
submitted
the
affidavits
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
simply
to
establish
that
there
is
a
factual
difference.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
noted
twice
in
the
opinion
that
the
act
769
was
not
before
the
trial
court,
and
did
not
pass
upon
it.
and
therefore
we
submit
that
even
if
the
court
should
narrow
the
limitation
of
the
view
in
this
case,
that
we
should
be
entitled
on
remand...
the
court
should
vacate
and
we
should
be
entitled
on
remand
to
present
evidence
on
the
amended
statute
either
in
this
case
on
remand
or
in
another
case
without
the
threat
of
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata
being
raised.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
well,
the...
it's
a
compelling.
the
standard,
if
we're
applying--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--well,
what
i'm...
mr.
white,
if
i
have
stated...
there
is
no
logical
distinction
between
the
two
inasmuch
as
they
are
transmitting
and
conveying
to
the
public
the
same
type
of
information.
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
compelling
interest
shown
on
the
state
to
show
a
differential
between
them,
and
that
the
reasons
the
state
has
offered
here,
the
use
of
the
public
right-of-ways
or
the
pervasiveness
of
television
in
the
home,
with
regard
to
a...
not
a
regulation
of
the
entry
or
the
access
but
with
regard
to
the
application
of
the
tax
is
not
logical.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
if
there
is
a
differential
in
taxation,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
is
probably
the
case.
but
we
have
attempted
here
to
target
or
to
limit
our
scope
of
review
to
those
entities
that
are
first
amendment
speakers,
that
are
members
of
what
we
refer
to
as
the
mass
communications
media,
those
that
are
transmitting
as
part
of
the
press,
either
electronic
or
print.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
we
don't...
i
was
going
to
say
have
that
situation
in
this
case,
but
i
would
say
that
that
argument
certainly
could
be
made
by
the
bookstore
operator
with
regard
to
what
he
was
selling
to
the
public.
we
are
not
in
anyway
asking
for
the
court
to
make
that
broad
a
distinction
in
this
case
because
what
we
have
before
you
is
what
we
consider
virtually
identical
methods
of
transmission.
the
only
difference
is
one
is
paper
and
one
is
electronic.
now
in
that
particular--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--justice
kennedy,
i
would
say
that,
again,
as
the
chief
justice,
that
is
an
argument
that
the
telephone
companies
could
raise,
whether
it
is--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--the
consequences
would
be--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--and
they
are...
in
the
case
of
when
they're
acting
other
than
a
common
carrier,
and
they
are
originating
the
information,
they
probably
have
that
same
constitutional
right.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
the
situation
that
i
think,
mr.
kennedy,
that
this
case
presents
is
exactly
the
one
that
was
left
open
in
the
arkansas
writer's
project
case,
and
that
is
that
in
the
instance,
in
the
first
part,
the
1987
to
1989
part
of
this
case,
that
being
when
the
direct
broadcast
satellite
services
were
not
taxed.
we
have
exactly
the
same
type
of
programming
being
delivered,
and
there
is
a
differential
between
cable
and
between
the
satellite
broadcast.
this
is
the
same
type
of
situation
that
existed
in
arkansas
writer's
project,
where
some
magazines
were
taxed
and
other
magazines
were
not
taxed.
after
the
amendment
in
1989--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--then,
mr.
scalia,
with
regard
to
the
part
that
was
reserved
in
justice
marshall's
decision
in
that
case,
of
whether
or
not
the
difference
between...
taxation
between
periodicals
would
be
an
additional
basis...
was
reserved,
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
is
presented
in
this
case.
we
have
a
different
type
of
periodical,
be
it
electronic
or
be
it
print.
we
have
a
differential
in
taxation.
and
again
we
go
back
to
the
minneapolis
star
decision
of
this
court
and
the
policy
matter,
the
decision
matter
that
there
is
a
distinction
being
drawn
between
similar
media,
and
as
such
that
once
we
have
established
that
we
are
providing
the
same
type
of
information,
and
once
we
have
established
that
we
are
being
discriminated
in
the
imposition
of
the
tax,
in
this
case
a
general
tax
and
exactly
the
same
tax
that
was
in
arkansas
writer's,
then
the
burden
or
proof
on
the
strict
scrutiny
or
heightened
scrutiny
switches
to
the
state
to
show
that
it
has
some
strong
or
compelling
interest
to
be
served
by
this
differential
in
taxation.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the,
the
use
of
the
right-of-ways
or
the
pervasiveness
of
television
are
sufficient
for
tax
purposes
to
sustain
that.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
in
the
particular
instance
here,
the
sale,
i
mean,
the
sales
tax
is
imposed
as
an
excise
tax
on
the
sale.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
so
i
think
that
would
be
a
distinction
that
would
be
drawn.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
i
would
think,
in
response,
mr.
scalia,
that
it
would
have
to
apply
generally,
and
that
is
what
this
court's
admonitions
in
minneapolis
star
and
arkansas
writer's
meant
to
say.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
excuse
me,
chief
justice.
justice
scalia.
in
that
particular
instance
i
think
that
the
cable
industry
in
arkansas
pays
sales
tax
upon
any
purchases
that
it
makes,
in
the
same
manner
that
the
broadcast
media
or
the
print
media
pays
a
sales
tax
or
a
use
tax
upon
tangible
personal
property.
it
is
only
in
the
instance...
or
all
tangible
personal
property
is
subject
to
tax
in
our
state.
the...
only
certain
enumerated
services
are
subjected
to
tax,
and
you
don't
have
the
presumption
that
all
services
are
taxed,
as
you
would
all
property.
and
in
this
particular
instance
they
have
chosen
only...
the
legislature
has...
to
extend
the
tax
to
certain
entities
within
the
media
and
to
exclude
others.
and
we
believe
that
there
is
no
compelling
interest,
or
any
logical
reason
for
that.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
i
do
not
believe
it
would,
because
i
believe
that
the
newspapers
stand
in
the
same
strike
that
cable
would.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
the...
this
court
in
the
application
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
press
and
speech
to
cable
tv
treated
it
as
a
passive
receiver
in
the
1960's
and
1970's.
but
in
1979
this
court's
decision
in
the
midwest
video
case,
the
second
midwest
video
case,
you
found
that
the
fcc
had
gone
beyond
its
jurisdiction.
the
result
is
that
congress
acted
in
1984
to
establish
a
comprehensive
policy
for
cable.
in
that,
the
hearings
on
that,
or
the
report,
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
detail
given
or
consideration
given
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
cable,
and
how
both
the
cable
operator
and
the
cable
subscribers'
first
amendment
rights
should
be
protected
and
were
trying
to
be
protected
by
congress
in
that
act.
in
particular
in
section
542(g),
congress
states
that
there
should
be
the
ability
to
subject
cable
to
general
taxes,
such
as
sales
and
income,
and
this
type,
but
it
said
not
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
and
that
is
what
we
are
objecting
to
here,
is
that
the
tax
in
arkansas
has
been
subjected
in
a
discriminatory
manner
against
cable
and
not
against
the
similarly
situated
entities
within
this
mass
communications
media.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
no,
there
is
not.
it
is
part
of
the
general
tax
that
is
imposed
upon
retail
sales.
the
only
difference
is
that
it
has
not
been
extended
to
the
sale
of
magazines
by
subscription,
the
sale
of
the
newspapers--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--that
is
correct.
they
could...
they
have
either
decision,
either
tax
all
media
or
tax
no
media.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
no.
because
this
court
has
ruled
that...
and
we
accept
as
a
standard,
that
a
tax
of
general
application
that
is
applied
to
all
media
would
have
to
be
borne.
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
we're
not
subject
to
tax.
we're
simply
saying
we're
not
subject
to
tax
in
this
discriminatory
way
in
which
the
state
has
attempted
to
impose
it
here.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
because
of,
as
this
court
stated
in
the
minneapolis
star
case,
it
offers
the
incentive
for
the
legislature
to
act
as
a
carrot
and
a
stick,
to
play
one
media
off
against
the
other,
to
offer
if
you
change
your
viewpoint
we'll
take
the
tax
off
or
we'll
exempt
you.
that
potential
exists.
and,
as
justice
o'connor
stated
there,
it's
not
just
what
the
tax
is
being
imposed
here,
but
it's
the...
perhaps
the
promise
or
the
potential
for
other
differential
taxes--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--with
regard
to
the
first
amendment,
as
when
newspapers
are
not
subjected
to--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--acting
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
congress
can
generally
exercise
any
power
over--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--so--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--a
number
of
courts
have
indicated
that
exclusive
franchising,
it
does,
because
that
there
ought
to
be
more
than
one
speaker,
that
there's
no
reason...
no
logical
or
compelling
reason
to
limit
it.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
valid
distinction
that
should
be
made.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
but...
well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
perhaps
have
shown
the
compelling
interest,
and
that
being
the
licensing
of
the
franchises--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--the
licensing
and
franchising
of
the
use
of
the
public
property.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
the...
again,
the
predominant
use
or
continued
use
of
the
public
right-of-ways
in
that
instance
is
one
that--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--not
on
that
basis.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
because
there
is...
it
has
no
logical
connection
with
it.
the
franchise
fee,
the
payment
for
the
use
of
that
right-of-way,
does.
and
that's
what
cable
pays,
is
a...
that
plus
the
pole
rental
is
for
the
rental
or
the
use
of
that
public
right-of-way.
the
sales
tax
is
not
directed.
it
does
not
compensate
the
state
for
that
particular
use,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
franchise
fee
does.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
the
subsidation
would
probably
bring
into
consideration
this
court's
decision
in
reagan
v.
taxpayers
with
representation.
it
perhaps
would
lower
the
standard,
but
it
is
an
instance
in
which
it
is
not
a
direct
effect
upon
the
speaker's--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--well,
the...
i
think
the
real
difference
would
be,
in
those
particular
instances
of
public
television
and
public
radio
that
are
being
funded,
they,
in
the
commercial
sense
that
they
could
not
attract
enough
to
provide
that
type
of
programming
and
the
access
is
one
that
the
state
is
trying
to
get
a
broader
and
a
further
discussion
of
public
issues
of...
and
as
the
court
said,
of
government,
being
those
that
are
the
most
important.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
yes,
i
do.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
that
would
be
a
subsidy.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
a
permissible
one,
but
i
think
that
it's
also
one
that
they
probably
could
charge
a
minimal
amount
to
state
for
whatever
use
of
the
public
right-of-way
that's
being
made.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
they
do.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
it
would,
justice
blackmun,
with
the
exception
that
again
i
think
it
deals
with
the
entity...
or
the
instance
of
a
subsidy
as
opposed
to
the
direct
speaking.
and
here
we
have
a
tax
being
imposed
upon
the
delivery
of
the
message,
as
opposed
to
one
that
is,
again,
several
levels
down
and
a
very
minor
amount
of
the
subsidy
that's
being
put
in.
it
is
not
one
in
which
the
government
is
subsidizing
the
entirety
of
the
local
programming.
and
also,
i
believe
that
this
court's
longstanding
determination
that
the
veterans
have
specific
or
perhaps
greater
rights
because
of
their
service
to
the
country
is
a
distinguishing
point
in
that
case
that
is
not
presented
in
these
cases.
and--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--i
would
simply
say
that
this...
what
i
have
stated
to
distinguish
it
i
believe
is
sufficient,
that
it
is
not
in
the
same
line
as
the
minneapolis
star
or
arkansas
writer's
project
type
of
case
that
is
attacked...
or,
excuse
me,
review
of
the
first
amendment
application
to
the
delivery
of
the...
or
direct
delivery
of
the
message.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
well,
it
does.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
it
does
exempt
not-for-profit
organizations.
charitable
organizations
are
exempt
under
the
statute.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
in
the
sense
of...
most
of
those
aren't
selling
any
type
of
newspaper.
they're
not...
or,
excuse
me...
any
message.
they're
simply
performing--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--the
basic
principle
for
the
exemption
of
any
charitable
organization
is
they're
supplying
a
service
or
some
need
that
the
state
would
otherwise
have
to
supply.
and
in
this
particular--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--that
would
be
a
consideration
of
a
compelling
state
interest,
but
that
is
what
i'm
stating
is
the
reason
that
the
courts
in
arkansas
at
least
have
held
that
the
tax-exempt
or
charitable
organizations
may
be
exempt
from
tax.
now,
in
the--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--that's
correct.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
well,
in
this
particular
instance
i
would
say
it
would
simply
be
the
delivery
of...
if
it's
the
message
of,
again,
not
a
general
interest
but
simply
the
charitable
organization's
organ
of
dissemination
of
information
to
its
members
or
its
supporters
that
is
a
confined
and
limited
purpose,
it
perhaps
is
sufficient
to
rise
to
a
compelling
need.
on
the
other
hand,
in
arkansas
the
municipalities
that
operate
a
cable
system
are
required
to
impose
the
sales
tax
in
the
same
manner
that
a
private
organization
is
required
to.
now,
the
other
courts
that
have
considered
this
question,
the
state
courts
that
have
considered
this
question,
have
more
broadly
applied
this
court's
rationale
in
minneapolis
star
and
arkansas
writer's
project
than
has
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
stated
that
its
only
reason
for
not
more
broadly
applying
it
with
regard
to
the
print
and
the
cable
entities
was
because
it
found
no
case
of
this
court
that
had
required
the
same
type
of
taxation.
in
the
oklahoma
broadcasters'
case
and
the
mcgraw-hill
case
in
new
york,
the
courts
did
apply
broadly
to
both
the
print
and
the
electronic
media
the
same
standards,
and
they
said
that
again
the
burden,
because
of
this
policy
decision
of
this
court,
is
upon
the
state
to
show
a
compelling
interest,
which
it
did
not.
and
that
is
the
test
that
we're
urging
this
court
to
apply
in
both
the
first
and
second
parts
of
this
case,
to
find
that
the
print
media
and
the
cable
media
are
similarly
situated,
delivering
the
same
message,
and
therefore
should
be
taxed
in
the
same
manner.
and
if
they're
not,
if
the
state
fails
to
show
a
compelling
or
substantial
interest,
then
the
tax
must
be
stricken.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
that
would
certainly
be
subject
to
question,
and
i
think
that
the
theater
owners
would
have,
with
regard
to
their
particular
type
of
communication,
a
valid
claim
that
there
is
a
discrimination.
this
is
what
the
illinois
court
held
in
the
satellite
link
case
where
cable
was
not
taxed
and
the
microwave
services
providing
the
same
movies
were
taxed.
and
i
would
say
that
that
would
apply
in
the
same
manner.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
theaters,
yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
but,
justice
stevens,
in
arkansas
the
theaters
are
taxed
and
cable
is
taxed.
what
we're
directing
at
is
more
the
heart
of
the
traditional
press,
that
being
the
newspapers
and
our
communication...
c-span--
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
--yes.
mr.
eugene
g.
sayre
no,
i
cannot.
again,
the
cross-ownership
within
the
medias,
the
fact
that
magazine
publishers,
newspaper
publishers
also
own
broadcast
stations
and
the
cable
entities,
is
another
sign
that
these
are
all
part
of
the
same
method
of
communication,
the
same
manner
of
communication
in
the
press.
if
you
go
into
a
newsroom
of
any
of
these
entities
you
will
find
the
same
electronic
computers,
the
same
word
processors.
the
only
difference
is
the
method
of
delivery
of
the
final
message,
that
being
whether
it
is
delivered
on
print
on
your
doorstep
or
whether
it
comes
through
your
television
screen
on
cable
or
broadcast.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
release
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
