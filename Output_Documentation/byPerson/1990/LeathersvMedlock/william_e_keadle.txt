mr.
william
e.
keadle
mr.
chief
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
arkansas
law
provides
for
gross
receipts
tax
of
general
applicability
to
sales
of
all
tangible
personal
property
in
arkansas
in
certain
services.
the
law
also
provides
for
certain
enumerated
exceptions,
one
being
an
exception
for
sale
of
newspapers.
the...
since
1987
the
tax
has
been
applied
to
sale
of
cable
television
services,
and
in
1989
the
gross
receipts
tax
law
was
amended
to
add
to
the
sales
tax
the
service
of
descrambling
of
satellite
services
provided
to
home
dish
owners.
the
same
general
gross
receipts
tax
is
applied
to
many
businesses,
like
cable
tv
service,
that
being
home
video
rentals,
books,
magazines,
admission
to
sporting
events.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
who
are
the
petitioners
in
90-39,
have
challenged
the
arkansas
tax
because
an
exemption,
as
is
extended
to
newspapers,
is
not
also
extended
to
the
sale
of
cable
television
service,
citing
that
there
is
a
similarity
between
the
two
services.
the
law
does
not
in
fact
violate
the
first
amendment
for
the
reason
that
cable
television
service
is
a
distinguishable
medium
from
the
newspapers.
the
state
is
not
arguing
that
cable
television
is
not
entitled
to
some
first
amendment
protection.
it's
just
that
the
ability
to
tax
one
of
the
medium,
one
of
the
media
is
not
necessarily
binding
the
state
to
tax
the
other
medium
in
the
same
way.
the
tax
involved
does
not
single
out
the
press,
nor
is
it
content
based.
the
taxpayer
would
have
you
believe
that
it
should
be
compared
to
newspapers
to
be
actually
a
group
within
the
press
that
is
being
singled
out
for
special
treatment.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
that
is
the
issue
that
the
state
is
appealing.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
it
has.
after
the...
approximately
11
days
after
the
trial
court
made
its
ruling--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--upholding
the
tax,
the
law
was
changed.
now,
this
was
before--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
your
honor.
it
seems--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--somehow
inconsistent,
but
the
basis
of
our
argument
is--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
that
could
well
happen,
but,
your
honor,
we
are
arguing
that
the
tax
as
it
stood
in
1987
was
constitutional
due
to
the
fact
that,
although
evidence
was
presented
that
these
two
media
provided
similar
types
of
services,
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
two
media
that
would
justify
the
different,
different
tax
treatment.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
between
1987
and
1989,
at
the
time
the
taxes
were
escrowed
in
the
case
it
was
approximately
$6.2
million.
at
present,
after
the
arkansas
supreme
court
ruled
in
the
case,
the
respondents
went
back
into
court
and
asked
that
the
escrow
account
be
reestablished.
instead
an
agreement
was
reached
between
the
parties
whereby
the
state
would
reserve
an
amount
in
one
of
its
refund
accounts
to
compensate
for
the
$6.2
million
plus
accumulated
interest.
i
believe
now
it
stands
at
somewhere
around
$8.1
to
$8.5
million.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
true
escrow
in
that
sense.
there
is
not...
it's
more
rather
that
the
state
would
not
have
to
make
that
refund
out
of
its
existing
refund
accounts.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes,
your
honor.
on
one
hand
there
will
be
a
refund
of
taxes
collected
prior
to
the
1989
change,
and
in
the
other
instance
the
tax
is
ongoing.
there
will
be
a
request
for
refund
of
that
money,
too.
as
i
had
stated
before,
there
is
really
no
first
amendment
violation
in
terms
of
treating
two
like
entities
differently
for
tax
purposes--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
your
honor,
in
some
sense
they
do
compete
for
viewer
dollars,
consumer
dollars.
it's
more
of
a
fact
that
physically
they
are
different
services.
in
the
cable
situation
you
have
a
process--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
clear
that
in
fact
evidence
presented
at
the
trial
showed
that
many
of
the
types
of
programs
that
cable
offered
were
indeed
similar
to
those
provided
by
newspaper.
but
the
difference
here
is
in
the
physical
make
up
of
the
two
services
and
how
does
this
burden
on
the
government
to--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--that
is
between
cable
and
newspaper?
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes.
that
statement
was
made,
and
that
is
what
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
i
think
it
was
more
a
review
of
past
cases
of
this
court
that
had
not
necessarily
made
the
distinction
between
cable
and
newspapers
as
being
competing
interests,
even
though,
even
though
the
evidence
presented
was
they
are
similar
types
of
programs.
they
are
still
different...
different
entities.
the
tax
involved
in
this
case--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
basis--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--no,
i
don't
believe
it's
whether
the
two
are
competing
necessarily.
that
may
be
a
factor
in
the
determination,
but--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--other
aspects
have
to
be
looked
at.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
the
criterion
that
the
state
is
arguing
and
that
we're
looking
at
is
the
type
of
burden
that
is
placed
on
the
government
by
the
two
types
of
services.
in
your
newspaper
situation
you
don't
have
certain
aspects
that
you
have
in
cable,
like
the
stringing
of
the
cable
along
the
public
rights-of-way
on
wires,
underground,
the
basic
interference
with
the
government
function,
and
also--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
your
honor.
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
tax
that
is
not
content
based
or
does
not...
and
where
the
similarity
between
the
two
comes
into
play
is
when
you're
not
dealing
with
two
similar
enough
entities
to
make
that
distinction,
then
you
do
use
the
rational
basis
test.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
that's
correct,
and
i
believe
this
court's
decision
in
another
arkansas
case,
the
writer's
project
case--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
believe
this
court
has
also
stated
that
an
effect
on
a
newspaper,
that
particular...
that
particular
example
in
the
minneapolis
star
case,
that
when
you
examine
it
and
see
that
the
effect
is
had
only
on
a
few
members
of
the
press,
in
that
case
a
small
group,
a
use
tax
on
publishers,
rather
that
it
was
shown--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
a
rational
basis
there--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--the
court
struck
it
down
because
the
tax
in
effect
targeted
a
small
group
within
one
entity.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
in
effect
it
was
the
same
entity.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
it
was
the
same
entity,
as
opposed
to
competing
entities.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
the
same
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--the
tax
was
on
publishers.
yes,
they're
different
newspapers,
but
they
are
newspapers.
they
are
a
member
of
the
print
media,
and
the
distinction
we're
making
here
is
they're
two
different
types
of
media.
they
are
competing,
but
the
differences
are
physical.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
that
situation
you
can
actually
distinguish
between
the
satellite
service
and
the
cable
tv
service
in
that...
in
that
basically
the
way
the
program
is
received
in
the
home,
in
one
instance,
satellite
service,
can
be
distinguished
from
cable.
cable,
again,
uses
public
ways
and
performs
a
type
of
intrusion
on
the
government,
while
the...
in
the
satellite
dish
situation
the
signal
is
beamed
directly
into
the
home
and
there
is
not,
there
is
not
a
basis
to
distinguish
on
in
that
instance.
the--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
your
honor,
to
some
extent
that
is
true.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
i
believe
the
distinction
is
still
there.
a
look
at
other
types
of
government
protection
afforded
to
cable,
cable
service,
such
as
franchises,
rate
regulation--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
your
honor,
it's
true
there
is
some
payment
for
the
franchise,
but
i
don't
think
it's
clear
also
that
that
is
necessarily
full
compensation
for
that
service.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
that
may...
and
the
distinction
there
may
well
be
more
of
a
basis
upon
how
administratively
easy
it
is
to
collect
the
tax
from
newspapers
as
opposed
to
cable.
i
believe
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
the
collection
of
tax
from,
or
the
collection
of
revenues
for
the
satellite
service
was
actually
to
some
extent
being
conducted
by
the
cable
operators
themselves.
it
does
not
appear
at
any
fee.
i
think
this
becomes
important
when
you
look
at
the
fact
that
the
arkansas
legislature
changed
the
law
before
the
arkansas
supreme
court
ruled
that
these
were
similar.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
that
may
well
be
true.
i
know
that
that
is
a
distinction
the
court
has
brought
out
at
times,
specifically,
i
believe,
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
minneapolis
star
case,
that
based
a
distinction
that
there
is
at
least
some
administrative
inconvenience
in
collecting
the
tax
of
newspapers.
admittedly,
maybe
it's
similar
to
others,
but
that
distinction
has
been
made.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
in
effect
they
use
both,
both
the
wires,
the
wires
and
underground
conduits.
they
make
use
of
the
public
streets
to
lay
these...
lay
these
wires.
and
that
not
only...
not
only
causes
problems
necessarily
in
traffic
and
other
means,
but
there
is
actually
a
physical
use
of
phone
wires--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes.
yes,
they
do.
i
think
in
arkansas
both
methods
of
using
the
above
ground
poles
and
underground
conduits
are
used.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
i
believe
that--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
that
was
indeed
mentioned
in
the
findings,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
finding
is
not
completely
correct,
given
the
fact
that
this
court
in
the
preferred
communications
case
has
at
least
sent
that
case
back
down
for
more
evidence
on
how
that
fee
is
collected
and
how
it
is
used.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
evidence
that
we
have
can
allow
us
to
make
a
decision
without
necessarily
addressing
that
portion.
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
do
recognize
that
there
is
a
franchise
fee
paid
and
what
it
goes
to.
but
that
it's
not
necessarily
a
full
compensation
for
the
intrusion
of
the
public
rights-of-way.
i
believe
the
arkansas
supreme
court
said
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
franchise
fee
fully
satisfied
the
problem.
therefore
they
rejected
the
public
rights-of-way
argument.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
no,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
the
difference
in
the
two
examples,
one
being
the
candy
and
the
other
being
the
difference
between
cable
and
newspaper
and
cable
and
scrambled
satellite
services
is
to
what
extent
the
respondents'
first
amendment
rights
are
being
violated.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
i
believe
on
one
hand
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
need
for
the
state
to
raise
revenue
is
a
rational
basis
for
making
any
decision
to
tax
a
certain
subject.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
we
would
very
well
probably
be
up
here
trying
to
make
another
distinction,
but
i
believe
that
the
cases
indicate
that
we
could,
we
could
make
that
distinction
and
reverse
around.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
your
honor,
that
does
bring
to
mind
the
o'brien
case
that
in
effect
stated
that
the
interest
should
be...
should
be
important
or
substantial.
that
may
well
indicate
that
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
should
be
used.
i
believe
it
goes
to--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
your
honor,
i
feel
that
that
was
suggested
in
a
case
where,
as
in
arkansas,
that,
that
interest
was
needed
to
justify
a
content
based
discrimination.
in
this
instance
the
tax
is
levied
on
all
cable
operators,
regardless
of
the
content
of
what
they
provide.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes,
your
honor,
it's
applied
to--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--oh,
it
applies
to
all
similarly
situated
businesses.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
the
newspaper,
in
effect,
is
part
of
a
limited
number
of
exemptions.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
your
honor,
i
feel
it's
very
clear
here
that
not
only
is
that
content
based--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
too.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
within
the
state's
province
to
do,
again
subject
to
a
challenge
on
why
it
was
done.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
well,
that
would
be
the
first
argument.
yes,
they
are
different.
i
think
a
further
look
would
have
to
be
made
at,
again,
if
there
is
any
legislative
history
as
to
why--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
think
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
matter,
again.
i
think
on
a
case-by-case
basis
we'd
have
to
look
at,
look
at
other
considerations.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
they
compete
for
the
same
dollar
alone
would
be,
would
be
enough.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
effect
is
a
higher
point,
too,
when
you're
looking
at
a
regulatory...
well,
in
fact
taxation,
too,
is
a
regulatory
form
of
restriction.
but
that
type
of
restriction
more
goes
to
the
absolute
restriction
of
a
media
to
speak
at
all,
as
opposed
to
a
tax
exemption
which
might
have
some
burden,
but
the
message
is
going
to
be
conveyed
as
long
as
the
tax
is
not
content
based.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
e.
keadle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
take
exception
to
one
of
mr.
sayre's
statements
made
early
on
that
the
arkansas
general
assembly
enacted
this
amendment
to
the
tax
because
it
was
found
that
satellite
television
services
and
cable
services
were
the
same.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
no
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
that
was
indeed
the
case,
so
i
do
not
feel
that
we
are
left
with
that
result.
the
trial
court
did
not
make
that
determination,
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
did
not
make
that
determination
until
after
the
law
was
changed.
so--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--well,
justice
white,
i
would
suggest
that
there
might
well
be
another
reason
for
the
distinction
at
first
between
satellite
and
cable
television
service
and
the
later
addition
to
the
tax--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--your
honor,
i
believe
there's
an
even
greater
distinction--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--they're
quite
different.
in
fact
even
more
so
than
satellite
and
cable,
due
to
the
fact
that
satellite
might
be
seen
more
as
a
retransmission,
as
maybe
cable
was
looked
at
earlier,
of
other
programming.
there's
not
that
original
content--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--i
think
the
distinction
is
relevant
due
to
the
fact
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
trial
record
that...
or
through
testimony,
that
brought
up
the
fact
that
the
fees
collected
for
this
service
were
collected
by
the
cable
companies
and
then--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--in
the
state
of
arkansas.
therefore
it
might
have
occurred
to
the
general
assembly
that
here
is
an
administrative...
an
administratively
convenient
way
to
collect
taxes
on
these
services
where
there
may
not
have
been
any
perception
beforehand
that
it...
that
in
fact
maybe
administration
of
a
tax
on
this
service,
even
if
it
was
known
about,
would
be
feasible...
would
be
economically
feasible
for
the
state.
i
would
also
take
exception
to
mr.
sayre's
statement
that
perhaps
this
case
should
be
send
back
on
remand
due
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
a
chance
to,
to
make
an
argument
as
to
the
distinction
between
cable
and
the
newspaper
because
the
act
was
passed
prior
to
the
trial
court's
decision.
this
in
fact
was
the
same
argument
he
was
making
with
regard
to
the
1987
act.
there
was
some...
was
some
evidence
presented
that
there
were
similarities
between
satellite
and
cable
television,
but
the
thrust
of
the
case
seemed
to
be
that
the
first
amendment
violation
occurred
because
they
were
treating
cable
differently
from
newspapers.
there
was
not
an
appeal
made
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
with
regard
to
that
part
of
the
decision.
now
i
understand
that
the
taxpayers
in
effect
won
the
case,
and
they...
the
result
is
that
there
was
an
award
of
a
refund.
but
i
believe
that
the
respondents
had
a
full...
full
chance
to
argue
this
case,
and
in
fact
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
at
least
show
that
be
made.
in
conclusion
i
would
state
that
the
arkansas
tax
in
both
instances
is
not
violative
of
the
first
amendment
due
to
the
fact
that
it
does
not
single
out
the
press
for
special
treatment,
special
tax
treatment.
it
does
not
target
what
can
be
proved
to
be
a
small
group
within
the
press
for
that
treatment.
it
is
definitely
not
content
based.
therefore
a
rational
basis
should
be
the
only
requirement
of
the
state
to
justify
this
differing
tax
treatment.
i
might
further
address
an
argument
that
was
made
with
regard
to
whether
this
tax
exemption
could
be
seen
as
a
subsidy.
i
believe
that
if
that
were
the
test
to
be
made,
on
one
hand
we
could
win
based
on
the
writer's
project,
minneapolis
star
line
of
cases.
if
we
were
to
look
to
the
dissent
in
arkansas
writer's
project,
you
could
very
well
see
that
this
tax
exemption
to
an
otherwise
generally
applicable
tax
could--
mr.
william
e.
keadle
--thank
you,
chief
justice.
