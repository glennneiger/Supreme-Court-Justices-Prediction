mr.
sayre,
in
your
response
to
one
of
justice
scalia's
inquiries,
you
spoke
of
reagan
against
twa...
twr.
justice
blackmun
that
case
is
mentioned
by
one
or
two
of
the
amicus
curiae.
it
isn't
cited,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
in
either
your
briefs
or
your
opponent's
briefs.
do
you
have
any
comment,
further
comment,
about
the
reagan
case?
doesn't
it
give
you
some
trouble?
justice
blackmun
well,
the
amici
were
certainly
sufficiently
concerned
to
try
to
spar
that...
the
holding
in
that
case,
but
evidently
neither
you
nor
your...
opposing
counsel
was
concerned
about
it.
