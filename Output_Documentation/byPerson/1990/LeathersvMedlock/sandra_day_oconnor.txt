justice
o'connor
did
the
arkansas
supreme
court
find
that
cable
television
pays
a
franchise
fee
for
the
use
of
the
public
right-of-way?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
that
was
included
in
their
findings?
justice
o'connor
so
you
don't
support
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
on
that
point,
is
that
it?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
there
was
language
in
some
of
our
opinions
that
when
a
tax
is
placed
on
the
media
in
what
appears
to
be
some
discriminatory
fashion,
that
the
state
has
to
come
up
with
a
strong
state
interest
for
making
that
differential
tax.
justice
o'connor
is
that
right,
that
there's
some
heightened
scrutiny
when
the
first
amendment
is
involved?
justice
o'connor
how
about
arkansas
writers
and
minneapolis
star?
you
don't
think
that
those
cases
indicated
that
some
form
of
heightened
scrutiny
was
being
employed?
justice
o'connor
now,
sales
of
newspapers
and
magazines
sold
by
subscription
are
exempt?
justice
o'connor
and
cable
services
are
generally
sold
by
subscription,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
arkansas
imposes
a
sales
tax
on
all
tangible
personal
property
and
on
a
wide
range
of
services.
in
1987,
arkansas
included
for
the
first
time
a
sales
tax
on
cable
television
services.
a
cable
television
subscriber,
an
operator,
and
a
trade
association
representing
cable
operators
in
arkansas,
challenge
the
application
of
the
sales
tax
to
cable
services
and
the
exemption
or
exclusion
from
the
tax
of
newspaper
sales,
subscription
magazine
sales,
and
sales
of
scrambled
satellite
broadcast
television
service
to
home
dish
antenna
owners.
in
the
arkansas
chancery
court,
they
argued
that
the
tax
violated
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
shortly
after
the
chancery
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
sales
tax,
arkansas'
legislature
extended
the
tax
to
scramble
satellite
television
services.
on
appeal,
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
the
sales
taxation
of
cable
television
services
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment
after
its
extension
to
scramble
satellite
television.
believing,
however,
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
discriminatory
taxation
among
members
of
the
same
medium
and
that
cable
and
scramble
satellite
television
services
were
substantially
the
same,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
held
that
the
tax
violated
the
first
amendment
for
that
period
during
which,
it
applied
to
cable
but
not
to
scramble
satellite
services.
both
the
cable
petitioners
and
the
arkansas
commissioner
of
revenue
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari.
we
granted
the
petitions
to
decide
whether
the
first
amendment
prohibits
or
prevents
a
state
from
exempting
or
excluding
from
its
sales
tax
only
certain
segments
of
the
media.
we
conclude
that
arkansas'
extension
of
its
generally
applicable
sales
tax
to
cable
television
services
alone
or
to
cable
and
satellite
services,
while
exempting
the
print
media
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
arkansas'
sales
tax
presents
none
of
the
first
amendment
difficulties
that
have
led
us
to
strike
down
differential
taxation
among
members
of
the
press
in
the
past.
unlike
our
previous
cases,
this
case
involves
a
generally
applicable
sales
tax
that
does
not
single
out
the
press
for
special
treatment.
there
is
no
indication
that
arkansas
has
targeted
cable
television
in
a
purposeful
attempt
to
interfere
with
its
first
amendment
activities,
nor
is
the
tax
structured
so
is
to
raise
suspicion
that
it
was
intended
to
do
so.
moreover,
the
tax
is
not
content
based.
we
hold
that
differential
taxation
of
speakers
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment
unless
the
tax
is
directed
at
or
presents
the
danger
of
suppressing
particular
ideas.
arkansas'
exemption
or
exclusion
of
certain
media
from
its
sales
tax
has
not
suggested
any
interest
in
censoring
the
expressive
activities
of
cable
television,
nor
is
there
an
indication
that
the
tax
is
likely
to
stifle
the
free
exchange
of
ideas.
we
leave
the
question
of
whether
the
state's
temporary
tax
distinction
between
cable
and
satellite
services
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment's
equal
protection
clause
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
for
consideration
on
remand.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
