justice
william
h.

we'll
hear
argument
now
on
no.
89-1416,
air
courier
conference
of
america
v.
american
postal
workers
union.
mr.
farkas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
oral
argument
of
l.
peter
farkas
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner--
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
you
speak
up
a
little
bit,
mr.
farkas.
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
hearing.
perhaps
if
you
raised
the
lectern
a
little.
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
the
time
of
the
debate
on
the
postal
reorganization
act
of
1970,
was
any
of
that
debate
addressed
to
the
merits
of
the
private
express
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
farkas.
mr.
larkin,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
larkin
the
government
did
not
petition
for
review
in
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it's
simply
here
is
a
respondent,
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
permitted
to
raise
a
separate
question
from
that
raised
by
the
petitioners?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
authority
for
that
exception?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though...
even
though
not
jurisdictional
in
any
strict
sense
of
the
word
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
narrow
one.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
surely
is
not
a
jurisdictional
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
secular?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
present
testimony
or
present
your
views
to
the
hearing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
comments.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
secular,
it
strikes
me--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--now
these
are
your
arguments
on
the
merits,
you
say.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
strikes
me
there
as
something
that
could
be
made
by
any
person
from
the
general
public,
so
to
speak.
do
they
have
any
connection
with
the
special
standing
you
claim
as
being
postal
service
employees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
in
effect,
that
if
you
can
show
standing,
then
you
can
come
in
and
make
arguments
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
reason
for
your
standing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
seem
at
all
odd
to
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
is...
is
that
particular
statutory
section
set
out
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
whereabouts?
well,
don't
worry...
don't
take
time
from
your
argument
to--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
present
structure
authorizing
the
suspension
of
the
pes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
there
any
debate
or
discussion
or
was
the
statute
that
was
finally
formed
in
1960,
was
that
changed
in
any
way
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
of
1970?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
no
substantive
change?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
no
part
of
the
debate
over
the
postal
reorganization
act
in
1970
involved
this
statute,
which
you
say
is
the
crux
of
the
government's
power
to
move
here...
the
post
office's
power
to
move.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
that
wasn't
what
they
were
thinking
about.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
seems
to
me
that
greatly
weakens
your
case
for
standing.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
postal
reorganization
act,
saying
that
there
had
been
considerable
discussion
of
the
role
of
postal
workers
and
the
concern
for
them.
but
in...
that
may
well
have
been.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
something
quite
different
from
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
did...
but
did
that
have
any...
but
did
its
viewing
when
it
did
at
the
1960
statute
in
such
a
way
have
anything
to
do
with
the
postal
reorganization
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
that
question,
the
question
i
just
asked
you?
did
the
position
taken
by
the
post
office
after
the
postal
reorganization
act
about
the
authority
in
the...
have
anything
to
do
with
the
postal
reorganization?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they
were...
they
were
the
linchpin
before
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
afterwards,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
postal
reorganization
act
didn't
change
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
this...
again
i'll
ask
you
the
question
i
asked.
does
this
seem
logical
or
sensible
to
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
already...
they've
already
skyrocketed
far
beyond
the
rate
of
inflation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
secular.
mr.
farkas,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farkas.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
other
case
is
no.
89-1416,
air
courier
conference
of
america
versus
american
postal
workers'
union.
for
more
than
a
century,
congress
has
granted
the
united
states
postal
service
a
monopoly
on
the
carriage
of
letters.
these
laws
are
collectively
known
as
the
private
express
statutes
or
pes.
these
statutes
allow
the
postal
service
to
suspend
their
provisions
as
to
any
mail
route
when
a
public
interest
so
requires.
in
this
case,
the
postal
service
asks
acting
pursuant
to
this
authority
issued
a
regulation
authorizing
a
practice
called
international
remailing.
that
practice
allows
the
bypassing
of
the
regular
postal
service
and
the
use
of
private
carriers
to
deposit
directly
with
foreign
postal
services
letters
from
the
united
states
destined
for
foreign
addressees.
the
respondent
unions,
representing
employees
of
a
postal
service,
sued
in
the
district
court
claiming
that
the
record
before
the
postal
service
was
inadequate
to
support
a
finding
that
the
regulation
was
in
the
public
interest.
the
district
court
ruled
against
them,
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
unions
had
standing
to
assert
this
claim
and
that
the
suspension
was
not
justified
by
the
public
interest.
we
hold
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
that
the
unions
do
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
postal
service's
suspension
of
the
pes
in
order
to
permit
international
remailing.
when
congress
enacted
the
private
express
statutes
back
in
1847,
it
was
not
concerned
with
protecting
postal
employment
or
furthering
postal
job
opportunities.1
thus,
the
fact
that
postal
workers
might
lose
jobs
as
a
result
of
the
approval
of
international
remailing
is
not
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
challenge
the
regulation
here
in
question.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
without
reaching
the
merits.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
