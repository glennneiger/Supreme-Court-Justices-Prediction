mr.
larkin,
in
addition
to
the
apa
problem
i
guess
there's
also
the
question
whether
the
postal
express
statutes
create
a
private
cause
of
action,
and
of
course
you
say,
you
say
they
don't.
is
that
a
jurisdictional
issue
also
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question,
and
i
don't
know
if
the
record
comments
on
this
at
all,
but
we're
talking
about
a
net
loss...
i
mean,
a
loss
of
gross
revenues.
and
presumably...
and
this
is
why
you're
objecting...
there
are
also
some
jobs
that
are
going
to
be
lost
as
a
result
of
this,
which
means
that
there
are
some
costs
that
are
going
to
be
saved.
that's
inherent
in
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that--
justice
stevens
--is
there
anything
to
indicate
the
magnitude
of
the
net
loss?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
responds
to
my
question.
is...
and...
and
maybe
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
there's
a
little
bit
of
a...
sort
of
a
little
bit
of
a
tension
between--
justice
stevens
--your
standing
argument
that
you're
hurt
by
this
and
your
relying
entirely
on
the
loss
of
gross
revenues,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
this
gets
a
little
closer
to
standing.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
impact
on
loss
of
jobs?
how
many
jobs
are
affected
by--
justice
stevens
--was
there
anything
to
show
the
impact
on
jobs
of
the
1979
regulation?
justice
stevens
because
there
would
have
been
some
history
to
work
with
there
i
suppose?
justice
stevens
yes,
i
see.
justice
stevens
let
me
go
back
to
block
for
a
second.
that
wasn't
really
a
fact
that
there
was
no
review.
there
was
no
review
for
the
particular
class
of
litigant
that
was
before
the
court.
justice
stevens
mr.
secular,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
why
it
is
essential
to
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
the
various
things
it
accomplished
that
there
also
be
a
monopoly.
