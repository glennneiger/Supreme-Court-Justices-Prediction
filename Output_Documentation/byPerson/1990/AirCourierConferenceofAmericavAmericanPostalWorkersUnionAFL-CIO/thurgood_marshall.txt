you
know
of
any
other
instance
where

take
up
a
point
that
wasn't
raised
below?
justice

do
you
know--
justice
marshall
--do
you
know
of
any
instance,
other
than
the
one
you
gave,
where
this
has
been
done?
justice
marshall
off
of
any
other
part?
[laughter]
justice

well,
what
is
different
from
that
and
an
amicus

justice

the
trouble
is
you
can't
be
a
respondent
and
an
amicus
curiae.
justice
marshall
but
aren't
you
doing
just
that?
justice
marshall
well,

won't.

won't.
