mr.
l.
peter
farkas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
in
the
first
instance
international
remail.
i
thought
i
might
open
up
by
saying
a
little
more
about
remail
than
we
said
in
our
briefs.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
decide
both
the
issues
presented.
i
will
then
discuss
the
standing
issue,
and
mr.
larkin
will
go
with
the
merits
of
the
administrative
procedure.
international
remail
involves
the
shipment
in
bulk
of
large
volumes
of
business
documents,
publications,
and
business
correspondence
to
post
offices
abroad
for
mailing
to
the
ultimate
addressee.
for
example,
american
banks
that
have
overseas
depositors,
credit
card
companies
that
have
overseas
cardholders
have
to
send
the
monthly
statements.
rather
than
go
to
the
post
office,
affixing
u.s.
postal
service's
international
air
rate,
and
sending
them
off
to...
for
delivery
abroad,
under
international
remail
the
courier
will
pick
up
those
monthly
statements
in
bulk,
will...
they
would
be
unstamped.
they
would
be
put
on
an
air
plane
that
evening,
and
they
would
be
delivered
to
a
foreign
post
office
the
following
morning,
where
they
would
be
mailed
at...
usually
at
negotiated
rates
for
ultimate
delivery
by
that
post
office
or
by
another
foreign
post
office
in
some
other
country.
the
international
remail
involves
a
savings
of
time.
some
shipments
are
delivered
in
half
the
time
it
would
take
the
united
states
postal
service
to
deliver,
to
deliver
the
same
correspondence.
it
involves
a
savings
in
money.
some
of...
the
record
shows
that
savings
of
up
to
50
percent
exist
in
certain
market
for
delivery
by
international
remail.
these
savings
of
time
and
money
save
american
jobs.
the
record
shows
that
if
remail
were
unavailable
that
certain
publishers
would
move
their
printing
operations
abroad.
under
the
example
i
noted
before,
if
remail
were
unavailable,
that
is,
if
low
cost,
reliable
and
quick
service
for
delivery
of
statements
were
unavailable,
the
banks
or
credit
card
companies
may
think...
start
thinking
about
moving
their
computer
billing
operations
abroad.
so
in
short,
this
saves,
saves
american
jobs.
it
promotes
exports,
and
it
does
so
without
necessarily
cutting
into
the
business
of
the
postal
service
because
international
trade
is
not
a
zero
sum
game.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
standing
issue.
the...
in
1979
the
united
states
postal
service
suspended
the
operation
of
the
restrictions
on
private
carriage
of
letters--
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
--in
1979...
can
you
hear
me
now?
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
1979,
the
united
states
postal
service
suspended
the
restrictions
on
private
carriage
of
letters
by...
and
that...
those
laws...
the
restrictions
on
private
carriage
of
letters
are
referred
to
the
postal
monopoly
laws,
also
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
the
private
express
statutes.
the
1979
suspension
related
to
both
domestic
urgent
letters
and
international
urgent
letters.
soon
after
the
suspension,
the
practice...
the
international
side
of
the
urgent
letter
rule
was
used
both
to
deliver
urgent
letters
to...
individually
to
foreign
addressees
and
also
to
deliver
international
letters,
urgent
letters
in
bulk,
to
foreign
post
offices.
in
1985
the
united
states
postal
service
took
exception
to
the
delivery
of
letters,
urgent
letters,
to
foreign
post
offices
and
initiated
a
rule
making
to
prohibit
that
practice.
the
users
of
remail,
the
remailers
themselves
with
the
help
of
the
administration
and
members
of
congress,
participated
in
that
rule
making
and
the...
eventually
the
postal
service
turned
around
and
issued
a
rule
that
said
remail
was
okay.
it
was
lawful.
the
american
postal
workers
union
and
the
national
association
of
letter
carriers
then
sued
the
postal
service,
saying
that
the
suspension
was
improper
and
therefore
violated
the
postal
monopoly
laws.
they
alleged
as
their
injury
the
possibility
of
losses
of
jobs,
postal
employment
jobs,
and
the
district
court
found
that
to
meet
the
article
iii
injuring
fact
test
but
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
postal
employees
were
not
in
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
postal
monopoly
laws.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
and
we're
here
on
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
no,
we
did
not
and
we
disagree
with
the
government
that
that
issue
was
either
properly
raised
here
and
we
also
disagree
with
their
position
on
the
merits
of
that
issue.
in
order
to...
under
the
zone
of
interest
test,
in
order
to
look
at
whether...
one
looks
to
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
to
determine
whether
a
party
asserting
a
violation
of
an
act
was
the
party
who's
rightfully
entitled
to
pursue
that
suit.
the
private
express
statutes
were
originated
in
the
late
19...
late
1700's
as
a
general
tax
provisions
and
as
a
means
of
paying
for
post
roads.
the
only
time
that
congress
ever
debated
the
postal
monopoly
laws
were
in
1845.
and
at
that
time,
there
were
two...
two
reasons
advanced
for
the
postal
monopolies.
the
first
one
was
to
help
bind
and
build
the
frontier
and
connect
it
to
the
rest
of
the
country.
the
second
reason
was
to
control
the
flow
of
information.
at
the
time
it
was
believed
unfair
that
some
individuals
might
take
advantage
of
commercially
useful
information
that
travelled
faster
than
the
mails
could
carry
them.
never
in
the
history
of
any
consideration
of,
of
a
postal
monopoly
laws
were
the
interests
of
postal
employees
ever
considered.
therefore,
we
contend
that
the
postal
employees
are
not
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
postal
monopoly
laws
and
the
case
was
properly
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
the
unions
here
have
not
seriously
challenged...
in
fact
they
appear
to
have
abandoned
the
contention
that
the
private
express
statutes
give
them
standing.
they
now
turn
to
the
postal
reorganization
act
of
1970
as
the
appropriate
statute
to
look
to
for
standing
purposes
for
zone
of
interest
purposes.
we
believe
that
the
postal
reorganization
act
does
not
confer
standing
because
it
was
no
more
a
postal
employment
act...
it
no
more
promoted
postal
employment...
congress
no
more
considered
postal
employment...
that
is,
in
numbers...
in
promulgating
that
act--
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
--no,
this
is
not
a
private
cause
of
action
case.
this
is
a
judicial
review
case.
and
i
think
the
judicial...
if
that's
made
clear,
that
also
reflects
on
the...
on
the
reviewability
on
the
administrative
procedures
act
issue
raised
by
the
government
by
the
postal
service.
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
no,
it
wasn't.
congress
specifically
declined
to
change
the
private
express
statutes
at
that
time,
and
the
legislative
history
says
so.
in
short,
the
postal
reorganization
act
was
intended
to
make
the
post
office
into
a
more
businesslike...
government-owned
corporation.
the
unions
opposed
the
postal
reorganization
act
because
they
ended
civil
service
protection
for
employees,
and
it
was
predicted
to
reduce
postal
employment
in
the
long
run
because
it
was
predicted
to,
to
help
the
post
office
automate
and
help
the
post
office
get
the
congress
off
its
back
to
keep
it
from
automating.
and,
therefore,
the
purposes
of
the
act,
of
the
1970
act,
do
not
bring
the
postal
employees
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
private
express
statutes.
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
well,
they
are
being
inconsistent
in
the
sense
that,
justice
kennedy,
that
they
were
opposed
to
the
postal
reorganization
act
because
they
thought
it
would
cost
them
jobs.
if
that's
so--
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
--well,
but
they're--
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
--well,
but
congress
has
spoken
by
passing...
by
passing
the
postal
reorganization
act
over
their
objections,
and
congress--
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
--that's
not
their
intention
to
save
postal
jobs.
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
in
any
event,
the
purposes
of
the
private
express
statutes
are
not
clarified
or
helped
by
the
postal
reorganization
act.
they
were
passed
for
different
purposes
and
therefore,
the
postal
reorganization
act
is
irrelevant
to
bringing
the
postal
employees
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
postal
monopoly
laws.
i'd
like
to...
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
save
the...
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
l.
peter
farkas
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
secular
mentioned
that
the
postal
service
had
failed
to
consider
the
economic
tradeoffs.
at
joint
appendix,
page
72
to
73,
the
postal
service
did
state...
give
notice
of
the
estimates
of
$25
million
to
$250
million
in
gross
revenue
losses
and
net
losses
of
$3
million.
the
postal
unions
failed
to
present
any
evidence,
contrary
evidence,
of
tradeoffs.
there's
no
reason
for
the
postal
service
to
have
considered
evidence
or
arguments
that
weren't
raised.
as
to
the
apa
argument,
it's
really
not
an
apa
argument.
it's
a
reviewability
argument,
and
independently
of
the
apa,
there's
a
presumption
of
reviewability.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
private
express
statutes
that
precludes
reviewability.
in
fact,
the
court,
as
early
as
1921
in
the
burleson
case,
recognized
the
right
to
review
postal
service...
at
that
time,
postmaster
general's...
administrative
determinations.
when
the
apa
was
passed,
there
was...
it
intended
to
broaden,
not
limit,
reviewability.
the
apa
did
not
include
the
postal...
the
post
office
in
either
section
551
or
701
under
the
list
of
exempt
agencies.
in
1970,
when
the
postal
reorganization
act
was
passed,
the
congress
did
not
amend
551
or
701.
therefore,
410,
section
410
of
the
pra,
has
to
be
limited
to
the
purposes
of
the
pra
and
do
not
overcome
the
presumption
of
reviewability
of
administrative
actions
under
the
private
express
statutes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
