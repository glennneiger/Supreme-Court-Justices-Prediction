mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
the
unions
cannot
bring
this
law
suit
under
the
apa.
as
we
explained
in
our
opening
and
reply
briefs,
we
believe
that
the
unions
did
not
and
cannot
satisfy
the
zone
of
interest
tests
that
this
court
has
set
out
in
its
decisions.
but
we
and
in
this
case,
we
alone,
also
believe
that
there
is
an
additional
reason
why
the
unions
cannot
invoke
the
apa
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
congress
has
exempted
the
postal
service
from
the
apa
by
passing
section
410(a)
of
the
postal
code.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
normally,
no.
there
is
only
one
small
category
of
cases
where
we
think
that
could
be
done.
we
think
this
case
fits
into
that
category.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
exception
would
be
where
the
matter
is
jurisdictional,
and
we
think
that
the
way
this
court
discussed
this
type
of
issue
in
the
case
of
block
v.
community
nutrition
institute
that
it
treated
these
types
of
issues
as
being...
as
the
court
said
in
block...
in
effect
jurisdictional.
the
last
footnote
in
the
block
case,
footnote
4,
was
the
footnote
in
which
the
court
said
that
it
declined
in
that
case
to
resolve
the
article
iii
question
that
was
before
the
court.
the
question
in
that
case
under
article
iii
was
whether
the
plaintiff's
net
lawsuit
had
standing.
there
was
an
additional
question
in
that
case
of
whether
or
not
review
was
precluded
under
the
apa.
the
court
resolved
the
case
by
looking
to
the
preclusion
issue
and
not
resolving
the
standing
issue.
so
we
think
that
both
what
the
court
said
in
the
block
case
and
what
the
court
did
in
the
block
case
indicates
that
the
court
believes
an
issue
like
this
is
one
that
can
be
raised
in
this
sort
of
matter.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
term
"jurisdictional",
your
honor,
is
one,
i
readily
admit,
has
been
used
to
cover
a
variety
of
different
types
of
claims.
for
example,
sometimes
the
word
jurisdictional
is
used
when
really
the
word
authority
is
an
issue.
sometimes
the
word
jurisdictional
is
used
to
discuss
threshold
issues
which
would
normally
not
be
jurisdictional
in
the
article
iii
sense.
they
would
be
threshold
issues
such
as
whether
or
not
someone
has
exhausted
remedies
in
the
administrative
process.
but
the
peculiar
factual
scenario
in
the
block
case
tends
to
indicate,
i
think,
that
the
court
meant
that
in
the
stronger
jurisdictional
sense
because
there
was
in
fact
an
article
iii
question
that
was
presented
by
the
government
in
that
case.
we
brought
a
challenge
on
that
type
of
ground
to
the
decision
below.
it
was
one
of
the
questions
that
we
briefed
in
the
case,
and
the
court,
rather
than
resolve
the
article
iii
issue,
resolved
this
other
issue.
so
that
is
why,
your
honor,
even
though
i
readily
confess
that
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
below,
we
raised
it
for
the
first
time
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
and
that
normally
a
respondent,
of
course,
cannot
interject
a
new
issue
into
the
case.
we
think
nonetheless
this
fits
into
that
category.
and
there
is
another
and
a
smaller
reason,
i
might
like
to
add
at
this
point,
why
you...
court
may
wish
to
consider
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
a
narrow
one.
the
narrow
one
is
this.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
by
justice
white
in
the
clarke
case,
the
zone
of
interest
tests
is
principally
a
gloss
on
section
702
of
the
apa.
if,
therefore,
we
are
right
in
this
case
and
the
apa
is
inapplicable
to
the
postal
service,
then
that
is
the
type
of
issue
you
would
want
to
consider
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
zone
of
interest
test
is
the
proper
way
of
looking
at
this
case.
we
think
the
zone
of
interest
test
has
not
been
satisfied
by
the
unions.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
true.
that...
that's
not
a
jurisdictional
one,
i
agree.
that's
more
a
prudential
one.
and
i
bring
it
to
your
attention
because
we
thought,
since
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that
a
court
looking
at
this
sort
of
problem
would
have
to
consider
that
is
one
the
court
would
probably
want
to
keep
in
mind.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
there
is
indication
of
that
in
the
case
that
is
cited
in
footnote
4
in
the
block
opinion,
which
is
the
amtrak
case,
where
in
that
case
the
court
resolved
a
cause
of
action
issue
without,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
resolving
a
different
type
of
standing
issue.
so
if
that
case...
that
case
would
therefore
tend
to
indicate
that
a
private
right
of
action
case,
perhaps
only
where
you're
dealing
with
the
government
rather
than
a
private
party,
would
at
least
be
seen
on
that
sort
of
parallel.
but
i
would
also
admit
the
amtrak
case
did
not
use
the
word
"forfeit".
it
didn't
say
that
this
was
the
type
of
issue
that
could
not
be
forfeited.
normally,
a
private
right
of
action
issue
is
not
one
that
you
would
think
of
as
a
jurisdictional
issue.
that
i
agree.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct,
we
made
a
mistake.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
generally
the
court
doesn't
resolve
questions
that
weren't
raised
below,
but
for
example,
if
the
court
believes
it's
necessary
properly
to
resolve
the
case...
yesterday's
opinion
is
some
indication
that
the
court
will
resolve
the
case
at
least
on
a
basis
that
wasn't--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--argued
by
the
parties.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
not
off
the
top
of
my
head,
no.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you've
got...
the
rest
of
me
can't
come
up
with
an
answer
either.
and
we
think
for
the
reasons
i
have
said
now
and
tried
to
summarize
in
our
brief
that
it's
an
issue
that
the
court
would
want
to
consider
and
proper--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
we,
as
a
respondent,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
don't
have
any
greater
right
to--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
not
trying
to.
i
don't
want
to
try
to
force
something
on
the
court,
but--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--but
it
is...
it
is
the
way
we
looked
at
the
case,
and
we
think
that
it's
one
that
the
court
could
decide.
and
under
it's
precedents,
as
i
pointed
out,
there
would
be
reasons
to
believe
that
the
court
should
decide
it.
now
the
issue--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
that
bears
on
my
answer
to
what
i
gave
to
justice
white.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
what
the
court
in
the
clarke
case
said,
that
the
zone
of
interest
inquiry
is
best
looked
at...
best
looked
upon
as
analysis
of
section
702
of
the
apa.
it's
a
gloss,
if
you
will,
on
the
test
of
section
702
of
the
apa.
and
its
zone
of
interest
inquiry,
the
court
said
in
clarke,
is
also
far
more
generous
than
the
type
of
analysis
someone...
a
court
would
have
to
employ
under
a
cort
v.
ash.
so
whether
or
not
the
apa
applies,
therefore,
determines
to
some
extent
the
type
of
analysis
you
have
to
follow.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
you...
the
zone
of
interest
test
wouldn't
be
applied
differently,
but
as
you
say,
you
may
or
may
not
want
to
apply
it.
now,
in
our
view
they
haven't
satisfied
the
zone
of
interest
test.
the
private
express
statutes
are
the
relevant
statutes
to
look
to
in
this
sort
of
context,
and
the
unions
cannot
make
out
a
satisfactory
showing
that
they
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
private
express
statutes.
for
that
reason
i
believe
the
unions
have
in
part
also
tried
to
raise
what
they
call
a
common
law,
non-statutory
type
of
claim.
now,
this
court
has
in
some
limited
circumstances
allowed
that
type
of
showing
to
be
sufficient,
basically
in
two
types
of
circumstances.
one
is
where
someone
can
satisfy
the
prerequisites
for
obtaining
mandamus.
that
the
unions
cannot
do
here.
in
fact,
they've
made
no
real
effort
to
try
to
satisfy
the
strict
requirements
for
mandamus.
and
the
other
is
best
illustrated
by
the
court's
discussion
in
the
case
of
stark
v.
wickard...
is
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
implicitly
granted
someone
the
right
to
bring
a
suit.
that
also
is
not
the
type
of
showing
that
we
think
the
unions
can
make
out.
that
is
essentially
the
type
of
showing
a
union
would
have
to
make
out
to
satisfy
the
cort
v.
ash
test,
and
we
don't
think
they
can
satisfy
that
very
strict
showing.
so
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
matter
of
the
zone
of
interests
analysis,
we
don't
the
unions
can
satisfy
that.
they
can't
show
that
they
are
within
the
zone
of
interest.
and
to
be
perfectly
candid,
i
think
no
one
is
within
the
zone
of
interest
except
the
postal
service.
the
purpose
of
the
private
express
statutes
was
to
protect
the
postal
service's
ability
to
obtain
sufficient
revenue
so
that
it
could
serve
the
nation
at
a
uniform
rate.
it
wasn't
designed
to
protect
the
unions
or
postal
employees,
which...
and
the
concept
of
postal
employees
unions
would
have
been
unheard
of
in
1845,
when
the
statutes
essentially
took
their
current
shape...
and
the
statutes
weren't
designed
to
protect
anyone
else.
it
was
designed
basically
to
protect
the
union...
excuse
me,
the
postal
service
and,
therefore,
the
public
as
a
whole.
so
therefore,
it's
really
the
postal
service
that
fits
within
the...
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
private
express
statutes.
and
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief
and
i've
tried
to
summarize
here,
the
unions
also
cannot
satisfy
the
necessary
prerequisites
for
making
out
an
implied
right
of
action.
if
i
can,
then,
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
merits
of
the
case
in
the
remaining
time.
and
that
is
this.
we
think
that
this
record
here
is
an
excellent
example
of
precisely
how
congress
intended
the
rule-making
process
to
operate.
the
postal
service
started
out
with
a
rule,
a
proposed
rule,
in
which
it
believe
that
the
international
remailing
practice
was
unlawful.
after
hearing
from
considerable
commentary
by
both
members
of
the
public
and...
as
well
as
other
government
officials,
the
postal
service
changed
its
mind
in
reliance
on
those
comments
and
ultimately
adopted
the
international
remailing
rule.
the
unions
have,
i
think,
essentially
two
arguments
that
they've
made
to
try
to
criticize
the
postal
service
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
rule
is
not
likely
to
benefit
the
public
as
a
whole
and
is
likely
to
benefit
those
businesses
that
engage
in
international
business.
i
think
that's
a
misdirected
inquiry.
the
question
is
not
whether
the
entire
public
can
make
use
of
a
suspension,
but
is
whether
the
suspension
will
benefit
the
public.
in
this
case,
the
postal
service
concluded
that
it
would
for
a
variety
of
reasons
benefit
the
public,
and
that
was
based
upon
information
from
parties
not
only
in
the
private
sector,
as
i
said,
but
also
from
secretary
of
commerce,
the
chairman
of
the
president's
council
of
economic
advisors,
the
director
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget,
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
those
comments
indicated
that
this
will
help
american
businesses
sell
goods
overseas,
which
is
in
the
public
interest.
the
second
challenge
that
the
unions
have
raised
is
that
the
postal
service
did
not
adequately
consider
the
potential
revenue
effect
of
the
suspension
on
its
ability
to
serve
the
public
as
a
whole.
and
we
think
that
criticism
is
unfair.
the
postal
service
admitted
both
at
the
out--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
it's
not.
it's
worse
than
not
right.
it's
unfair.
the
postal
service
at
the
outset
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
process
admitted
that
it
did
not
have
the
hard
data
that
it
would
have
liked.
it
asked
the
public
for
that
data,
but
it
wasn't
forthcoming.
the
postal
service
therefore
faced
a
decision,
because
making
no
decision...
that
is,
not
adopting
a
suspension
or
deferring
a
suspension
would
be
as
much
of
a
decision
as
allowing
suspension
to
go
into
effect.
what
the
postal
service
did
was
use
a
worst-case
scenario.
it
took
a
very
high
over-estimate
of
the
potential
loss
that
it
would
suffer,
and
using
that
over-estimate
of
its
potential
loss,
nonetheless
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
potential
benefits
out
weighed
the
potential
loss.
and
that's
not
an
irrational
result.
under
a
public
interest
standard,
an
agency
is
entitled
to
make
that
sort
of
assessment,
particularly
since
the
agency
has
the
ability
over
time
to
monitor
the
situation.
if
in
fact
it
were
to
prove
that
this
would
be
too
financially
debilitating,
the
postal
service
would
have
the
ability
to
modify
the
suspension
or
repeal
it
entire...
in
its
entirety.
but
what
the
respondents
would
have
us
do
in
this
case
is,
in
the
absence
of
complete
and
perfect
data,
take
no
action
at
all,
basically
to
stymie
the
agency
until
it
had
the
type
of
data
that,
i'm
told
by
the
postal
service,
it
really
can't
ever
get.
in
those
circumstances,
that
would
simply
be
forcing
upon
the
postal
service
a
rule
that's
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
such
as
listeners
guild.
for
these
sorts
of
reasons
and
the
ones
laid
out
in
our
brief,
we
ask
the
court
to
uphold
the
postal
service's
decision
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
it
was
eminently
reasonable
and
satisfied
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
apa.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
you
had
a
request
in
this
case
and
you
had
a
difference
of
opinion
between
some
officials
in
the
executive
branch
and
the
postal
service
over
whether
or
not
for
example
this
was
a
practice
that
could
be
conducted
under
the
regulations
that
existed
beginning
in
1979.
the
postal
service
included
its
most
forthright
way
of
resolving
this
problem
was
to
go
ahead
and
adopt
a
regulation
setting
forth
its
considered
view
of
the
matter.
and
in
that
circumstance,
we
believe
that
what
they
did
was
eminently
reasonable.
now,
maybe
they
could
have
done
nothing,
but
it
would
have
left
this
cloud,
as
chairman
mckean
said.
they
thought
that
the
most
responsible
thing
for
the
agency
to
do
was
to
dissipate
that
cloud.
thank
you.
