mr.
keith
e.
secular
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
just
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
last
question
and
the
response.
this
case
is
not,
and
i
really
want
to
emphasize
this.
this
case
is
not
about
the
legality
or
the
illegality
of
international
remailing.
mr.
farkas'
clients
were
in
business
before
the
suspension,
and
regardless
of
what
happens
here,
they're
going
to
continue
to
be
in
business.
this
case
really
has
to
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
1979
urgent
letter
suspension.
that's
the
suspension
under
which
the
international
remail
practice
grew
up.
that
suspension
prescribed
two
tests,
certain
delivery
deadlines
which
had
to
be
satisfied
and
it
prescribed
an
alternative
cost
test.
the
private
courier
had
to
charge
a
certain
minimum
amount.
and
if
that
minimum
amount
was
charge
then
there
was
presumably
a
reason
why
the
mailer
wanted
to
use
a
private
courier
rather
than
the
postal
service.
that
was
the
balance
the
postal
service
struck
to
meet
the
needs
of
mailers
who
needed
to
go
outside
the
postal
service
while
at
the
same
time
safe
guarding
the
monopoly.
what
the
regulation
here
did,
and
this
is
the
point
that
petitioners'
arguments
are
missing,
is
to
release
the
international
remailers
and
their
customers
from
those
requirements.
to
simplify
it,
there's
a
minimum
requirement
of
a
charge
of
twice
the
applicable
postage
or
$3...
let's
just
say
$3...
for
a
given
mailing.
under
the
international
remail
suspension,
that
charge
is
no
longer
in
effect
for
this
one
group.
and
it
was
that
that
we...
that
we
attacked.
it
was
the...
what
we
saw
as
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
release
of
this
one
group
from
the
same
requirements
that
are
applicable
to
all
other
mailers
who
wish
to
use
private
carriage
rather
than
the
postal
service,
and
it's
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
we
contended
was
unjustified
by
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
we
presented
comments.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes.
now
as...
just
to
follow
up
on
the
merits
for
the
moment
and
i'll
move
on
to
the
reviewability
and
standing
issues.
the
issue
with
respect
to
revenue
loss,
which
was
the
primary
concern
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
not
simply
whether
or
not
the
postal
service
forecasted
or
attempted
to
forecast
how
much
revenue
would
be
lost.
the
question
is
the
failure
of
the
postal
service
to
examine
the
economic
tradeoffs
that
are
involved.
for
example,
international
mail,
just
like
any
other
class
of
mail,
is
expected
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
maintenance
of
the
postal
service's
institutional
infrastructure.
the
court
has
examined
the
rate-making
procedures
set
forth
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
in
the
national
greeting
card
case.
and
essentially
there
are
two
types
of
costs
which
arise
in
the
postal
service
rate-making
scheme.
one
are
attributable
costs,
those
costs
which
can
be
attributed
to
a
specific
class
of
mail,
and
other
cost,
which
is
simply
assigned
on
an
equitable
basis,
based
on
statutory
criteria,
to
all
the
classes
of
mail
in
order
to
preserve
the
postal
service's
institutional
infrastructure.
now,
while
international
mail
is
outside
the
scheme
of
the
postal
rate
commission,
it
has
historically...
and
the
evidence
we
submitted
in
the
record
makes
that
clear...
it
has
historically
made
a
contribution
to
the,
to
the
postal
service's
institutional
costs.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that's
right.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
under
the
case
law,
as
i
understand
it,
standing
is
a
separate
inquiry
and--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--yes,
we
can
assert
the
public
interest
once
standing
is
established.
i
think
the
cases
do...
like
the
sierra
club
establishes
that
and
some
of
the--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--well,
it's
a...
it's
a
bifurcated
inquiry.
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
function
of
the
zone
of
interest
tests.
the
zone
of
interest
test,
as
most
recently
articulated
in
clarke,
is
a
guide
to
the
court
to
determine
who
is
an
appropriate
plaintiff,
who
should
the
court
hear
from.
it's,
in
effect,
to
screen
out
inappropriate
plaintiffs,
those
plaintiffs
whose
interests
are
so
marginal
or
inconsistent
with
the
statute
that
presumption
is
fair
that
that
particular
plaintiff
would
not
be
a
reasonable
plaintiff
for
the
court
to
hear.
but
once
someone
has
satisfied
the
zone
of
interest
test
and
comes
before
the
court
as
a
reasonable
plaintiff,
i
think
the
cases
then
allow
that
plaintiff
to
challenge
the
legality
under
the
statute
without
regard
to
the
specifics
of
his
interests.
just
to
finish
up
the
point
on
costs.
the
question
that
the
postal
service
did
not
examine
was
what
effect
would
the
loss
of
revenue
that
it
forecasted
have
on
the
remaining
users
of
the
mail.
this
is
very,
very
simplistic
for
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
rate-making
process,
but
the
postal
service
calculated
the
cost
under
its
worst-case
scenario
as
a
little
bit
over
3
percent
of
its
total
revenue.
that's
an
enormous
amount
of
money.
3
percent,
if
it
were
distributed
evenly
over
the
rest
of
the
rate
structure,
could
mean,
for
example,
close
to
a
penny
increase
on
the
first
class
stamp.
the
question
is
what
is
the
rationale
for
making
the
remaining
users
of
the
mail
pay
ultimately
more
for
their
postage
so
that
the
customers
of
the
international
remailers
could
have,
in
essence,
free
access
to
the
remailers.
maybe
there
is
a
public
interest
rationale.
the
postal
service
never
articulated
it.
that's
what
troubled
the
court
of
appeals
and
that's
why
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
postal
service
to
articulate
that
kind
of
rationale.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that's...
what
you're
driving
at
is
whether
or
not
the
net...
whether
there
would
be
a
loss
of
net
revenue.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
whether
the
costs
incurred
by
a
postal
service
in
furnishing
international
mail
service
are
greater
than
the
loss
of
revenue.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes,
we
submitted
a
declaration
by
an
economist
which
was
not
rebutted
which
tended
to
show...
and
the
court
of
appeals
cited
to
that,
although
without
referencing
the
declaration...
that
there
was
a
net
loss,
and
that
in
fact--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--there
are
documents,
and
i
don't
have
the
number
off
the
top
of
my
head,
but
there
are
documents
in
the
record
from
the
postal
service's
comprehensive
annual
statement
of
operations
which
show
a
declining
international
mail
volumes
and
textually
a
comment
by
the
postal
service
that
attributes
at
least
a
significant
portion
of
that
loss
to
the
growing
practice
of
remailing.
so
there
is
something
in
the
record--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--i
don't...
yeah...
i
understand.
i
don't--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--well,
it
was
the
postal
service
that
cited
the
loss
of
gross
revenue.
there
is
no
specific
estimation
of
the
loss
of
net
revenue.
and
in
fact,
and
i
may
regret
saying
this
if
the
case
proceeds
any
further,
if
the
case
goes
back
to
the
postal
service
and
the
postal
service
establishes
that
there
is
no
significant
loss
of
net
revenue,
it
may
be
that
we're
not
going
to
prevail
ultimately
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that...
having
addressed
the--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--no,
what
we
cited
to
was
the
threat
of
job
loss,
which
i
think
is
sufficient
to
confer
injury
and
fact
standing
under
the
cases.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
no,
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
one
of
the
interesting
issues
that
is
raised
by...
and
i
may
be
wasting
my
time
by
elaborating
on
this.
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
questions
that
are
raised
by
the
urgent
letter
exception,
and
one
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
diversion.
the
philosophical
assumption
of
the
urgent
letter
exemption
was
that
there
was
a
type
of
service
that
the
public
needed
the
postal
service
couldn't
provide.
so,
in
theory
at
least,
the
mail
volume
that
was
generated
by
the
urgent
letter
exemption
is
not
volume
that
the
postal
service
was
already
processing.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
it's
also...
now
i'm
really
just
speculating
but
i
think
it's
fair...
one
could
theorize
that
the
marketing
activities
of
the
express
mail
industry
have
increased
the
overall
market,
and
possibly
increased
the
postal
service's
express
mail
business.
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
forecast
the
loss
in
revenue
or
job
impact
from
the
urgent
letter
exemption.
as
to...
briefly
on
the
question
of
judicial
review
and
whether
or
not
the...
this
case
can
probably
brought
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
only
justification
that's
been
offered
for
raising
that
issue
for
the
first
time
is
the
notion
that
this
is
in
essence
a
jurisdictional
claim,
and
the
authority
for
that
proposition
is
block
v.
community
nutrition
institute.
i
would
point
out
that
what
block
was
focusing
on
is
whether
the
substantive
statute
precluded
review
in
its
entirety,
not
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
apa
was
applicable.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
characterized
the
preclusion...
the
issue
as
jurisdictional.
there's
no
basis
in
the
case
law
for
treating
the
availability
of
the
apa
as
jurisdictional.
in
fact,
califano
v.
sanders
settled
that
the
apa
was
not
a
jurisdictional
statute.
this...
the
jurisdictional
statutes
involved
here
were
the
federal
question
statute
and
section
409
of
the
postal
reorganization
act.
that's
what
creates
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts
for
bringing
this
lawsuit
and
seeking
the
relief
that
we
sought.
at
that
point,
i
would
point
out,
it's
the
government
that
focused
and
defined
the
issues
in
terms
of
the
apa
zone
of
interest
test.
so
i
think
there's
no
basis
for
that
issue
being
raised
here
for
the
first
time.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that's
correct.
as
i
indicated
in
earlier
responses,
the
standing
question
as
the
case
now...
as
the
case
now
appears
before
the
court
is
defined
solely
in
terms
of
the
zone
of
interest
test.
the
zone
of
interest
test
focuses
on
whether
the
plaintiff
is
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
or
regulated
by
the
statute
in
question.
now,
the
argument
advanced
by
petitioner
in
this
case
focuses
primarily
on
the
notion
that
the
private
express
statutes
are
different
from
the
postal
reorganization
act,
which
is
the
organic
statute
involved.
and
we're
claiming
a
violation
of
the
postal...
of
the
private
express
statutes,
which
date
back
to
the
seven...
1700's,
when
there
were
no
postal
unions,
and
therefore
we
couldn't
be
within
the
zone
of
interest.
i'd
like
to
address
that
argument.
first
of
all,
let's
start
with
what
it
is
we're
contending,
because
i
think
that's
the
beginning
of
a
standing
inquiry.
our
contention
on
the
merits
is
that
the
postal
service
acted
in
excess
of
its
authority,
that
it
abused
its
discretion.
it
acted
arbitrarily
in...
and
capriciously.
the
source
of
the
authority
to
act
that
we
claim
the
postal
service
exceeded,
or
the
source
of
discretion
which
we
say
it
abused,
is
39
u.s.c.
601(b).
that
is
the
one
provision
which
the
postal
service
claims
is
the
source
of
its
authority
to
suspend
the
private
express
statutes.
the
argument
that
is
being
made
is
that
601
should
not
be
considered
part
of
the
postal
reorganization
act.
it
should
be
considered
some
sort
of
19th
century
enactment.
and
let
me
digress
and
just
address
the
history
here,
which
is
summarized
in
our
brief.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
601
is
in
the
statutory
appendix.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
just
to
paraphrase
it,
it
provides
that
the
postal
service
may
suspend
the
foregoing
section
or
any
part
thereof
where
the
public
interest
requires
the
suspension.
it's
referring
to
section
601(a),
which
sets
forth
certain
conditions
under
which
mail
that
would
otherwise
be
covered
by
the
private
express
statutes
can
be
carried
outside
the
mail.
in
essence,
if
an
individual
puts
appropriate
postage
on
a
letter,
seals
it,
and
marks
it
appropriately,
the
letter
can
be
carried
outside
the
mail.
that
privilege
of
carrying
letters
outside
the
mail
was
enacted
in
1852.
in
1852
the
postal
service...
congress
enacted
a
statute
which
gave
the
postal
service
the
authority
to
manufacture
embossed
envelopes
with
postal
on
the
envelopes
and
permitted
the
post
office...
and
further
provided
that
those...
letters
sealed
in
those
envelopes
could
be
carried
outside
the
mail.
in
1864,
congress
passed
another
statute
which
authorized
the
postmaster
general
to
suspend
the
1852
law.
in
other
words,
to
revoke
the
privilege
of
carrying
letters
outside
the
mail.
that
original
1864
enactment
never
authorized
the
post
office
department
to
suspend
the
monopoly,
and
that
was
clear
as
the
statute
developed
in
1872,
in
1938.
and
it
wasn't
until
1960
when
the...
when
title
39
was
revised,
that
the
present
structure
came
into
effect.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes,
the
present
structure
which
can
be
read
as
authorizing
suspension
of
the
private
express
statute.
and
i
would
point
out
that
was
enacted
without
any
debate.
be
that
as
it
may,
there
is
no
historical
practice
of
suspending
the
private
express
statutes,
which
dates
back
to
the
19th
century.
it's
a
modern
development.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
only
in
the
sense
that
post
office
was
changed...
postmaster...
the
reference
to
postmaster
general
was
changed
to
postal
service.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
no
substantive
change.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that's
correct.
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
really
wasn't
any
reason
for
congress
to
be
thinking
in
terms
of
suspensions
of
the
private
express
statutes
when
it
debated
the
postal
reorganization
act.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that's
right.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
i...
let
me
make
two
responses
to
that...
to
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is
that
i
don't
think
that
the
1960
statute
could
have
been
fairly
interpreted,
at
least
in
terms
of
congressional
intent,
as
authorizing
suspensions
of
the
monopoly.
the
postal
service
really
began
to
view
601(b)
as
a
source
of
authority
to
suspend
the
monopoly
for
reasons
of
policy
with
respect
to
certain
specific
classes
of
mail,
after
the
postal
reorganization
act
was
enacted.
that's
an
historical
response.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
the
governor's
report
in
1973
didn't
address
the
issue
as...
in
any
thorough
way.
but
let
me
move
onto
another
response.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
no.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
this--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--well,
i'm
not
sure,
claiming
the
protection
of
the
monopoly
is
precisely
the
right
characterization.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
our
argument
on
standing,
our
basic
argument
on
standing,
treats
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
the
private
express
statutes
as
functionally
a...
an
integrated
statutory
scheme.
and
that's
because
essentially
the
purposes
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
the
postal
monopoly
laws
are
crucial
interdependent.
the
policies
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
cannot
be
achieved
without
the
monopolies.
similarly,
the
purposes
of
the
monopoly,
viewed
post-1970,
are
to
effectuate
and
guarantee
the
conditions
under
which
the
policies
of
the
postal
organization
act
can
be
realized.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
fairly,
characterized
the
private
express
statutes
as
a
linchpin
of
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
let
me
also
point
out,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that's
correct.
but
a
related
point,
which
i
haven't
articulated
quite
yet,
is
that
it
shouldn't
matter
whether
private
express
statutes
and
the
postal
reorganization
act
are
considered
one
statute
or
two
statutes
or
however
many
statutes,
because
if
that
were
true
then
there
would
be...
the
holdings
of
the
banking
law
cases
from
data
processors
on
through
clarke
would
have
been
different.
in
data
processors,
for
example,
the
claim,
the
only
claim
on
the
merits
that
was
made,
was
that
the
allowance
of
national
banks
to
perform
data
processing
services
was
a
violation
of
the
national
bank
act.
when
it
came
to
standing,
the
court
looked
not
the
national...
the
policies
of
the
national
bank
act
but
to
the
policies
of
the
national
bank
service
corporation
act
of
1962,
a
much
later
enactment.
and
it
developed
a
zone
of
interest
tests
on
the
basis
of
the
interests
that
were
protected
by
that
statute.
similarly,
in
the
investment
corporation
case
that
followed
just
a
couple
of
years
later,
the
claim
on
the
merits
that
was
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs
was
that
the
regulation
allowing...
you
know,
the
ruling
allowing
national
banks
to
provide
investment
services
was
in
violation
of
the
glass-steigal
act.
well,
there
was
no
finding
at
any
time
by
the
court
that
the
glass-steigal
act
was
designed
to
protect
the
interests
of
businesses
in
the
stock
brokerage
business.
it
was
designed
to
protect
and
safeguard
the
interest
of
the
national
banks.
nonetheless,
the
court,
citing
data
processors,
found
that
the
policies
recognized
in
data
processors
were
sufficient
to
confirm
standing.
that
also
true
in
clarke.
in
clarke
the
statute
that
formed
the
basis
for
the
claim
on
the
merits
were
the
anti-branching
provisions
of
title
xii.
instead
of
focusing
narrowing
on
the
anti-branching
policies,
the
court
looked
to
the
overall
policies
of
the
national
bank
act.
so,
i
think--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--well,
i
think
it
depends,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
case.
we
use
the
term,
and
i
think
this
is
the
one
bit
of
terminology
we
attempted
to
add
the
case
law.
the
inquiry
must
be
statute
specific.
in
a
given
case,
it
may
very
well
be
appropriate
that...
to
hear
from
a
plaintiff
who
is
claiming
an
interest
from
an
enactment
which
is,
which
is
different,
although
related
to,
the
enactment
which
is...
which
will
control
the
merits.
and
i
think
this
is
clearly
one
of
those
cases.
i
think
we've
got
a
much
stronger
case
here,
because
the
relationship
between
the
statutes
at
issue
is
so
intimate.
the
policies
involved
are
critically
interrelated.
they
don't
make
sense
without
one
or
the
other.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
the
zone
of
interest
as
the
zone
of
interest
that
would
flow
from
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
the
private
express
statutes
viewed
as
an
integrated,
functional
whole.
and
i
certainly
think
that
there's
enough
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
that's
how
congress
thought
of
the
relationship
between--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--the
basic
rationale
for
that
was
articulated
in
the
1973
governor's
report.
briefly,
what...
the
focus
is
on
the
requirement
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
that
the
postal
service
provide
universal
service
at
uniform
rates.
those...
both
those
concepts
are
important.
the
postal
service
cannot
provide
uniform
service
at
a
uniform
rate
to
thinly
populated
rural
areas
if
it's
going...
if
at
the
same
time
private
companies
can
skim
off
profitable
mail
service
in
highly
populated
urban
areas.
that's
essentially
the
underlying
rationale
of
the
private
express
statutes
to...
as
found
by
the
governor's
1973
report.
it's
to
prevent
cream
skimming.
cream
skimming
must
be
prevented
in
order
to
allow
the
postal
service
not
only
to
provide
universal
service
but
to
charge
the
same
rate
for
transporting
a
letter
from
washington,
say,
to
alaska.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
the
statute
also--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--we
can
get
into
an
economic
debate
on
that,
justice
scalia.
the
result
of
that
would
be
that
the
rates
charged
by
the
postal
service
would
skyrocket
above
and
beyond
the
rate
of
inflation,
which
would
have
a
devastating
impact
on
volume.
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
the
system--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--well,
the
postmaster
general
has
made
that
a
fact,
and
i
think
that
points
up
our
argument
on
the
merits.
3
percent
loss
of
revenue,
if
that's
all
that
the
postal
service
is
talking
about,
could
very
well
be
the
difference
between
whether
or
not
rates
go
up
more
than
or
less
than
the
rate
of
inflation.
it's
that
tradeoff
which
the
postal
service
never
examined.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
the
question,
justice
scalia.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
postal
service
has
to
maintain
a
fixed,
nationwide
infrastructure,
which
prevents
it,
i
think,
from
responding
to
competition
out
on
the
fringes
in
those
particular
areas
where
rates...
where
rates...
where
a
lower
rate
could
be
charged
by
a
private
business
while
competing
with
the
postal
service.
that's
essentially
the
rationale
that
was
articulated
in
the
1973
governor's
report.
it's
the
rationale
that
underscores
the
conditions
which
the
postal
service
imposed
when
it
suspended
the
private
express
statutes
for
urgent
letters,
and
it's
that
basic
rationale
that
the
postal
service
ignored.
there's
one
other
point
i
want
to
make,
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question.
one
of
the...
another
one
of
the
policies
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
which
i
may
have
neglected
to
mention
is
the
requirement
that
the
postal
service
break
even,
that
it...
it's...
it
cannot
run
at
a
loss.
it
cannot
make
a
profit.
over
time
the
postal
service
is
to
break
even.
and
the
basic
thrust
of
that,
in
terms
of
the
1970
reorganization,
was
to
ensure
that
the
postal
service
would
no
longer
ultimately
have
to
depend
on
subsidies
from
the
taxpayer.
that's
another
aspect
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
which
is
dependent
on
the
maintenance
of
the
private
express
statutes.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
oh,
there's
no
question
of
that.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
a
substantial--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--a
substantial
purpose
of
the
1970
reorganization
was
to
address
the
legitimate
grievances...
that
the
phrase
that's
found
on
the
house
report...
of
the
employees.
the
statute
was
literally
a
response
to
a
nationwide
work
stoppage.
it
was
literally
collectively
bargained
by
the
unions
and
representatives
of
the
administration
in
the
white
house.
after
the
strike
was
settled,
the
unions
and
the
administration
met,
settled
on
the
broad
outlines
of
the
statute,
and
presented
it
to
congress.
that
pra
is
unique
in
that
aspect.
but
i
think
it
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
employees
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
in
that
act.
