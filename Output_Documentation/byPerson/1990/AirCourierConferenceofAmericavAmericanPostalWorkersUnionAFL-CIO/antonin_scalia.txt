justice

mr.
larkin,
in
the
case
that
we
decided
yesterday...
i
assume
you're
referring
to
arcadia?
justice
scalia
there,
it
was
difficult
to
decide
correctly
the
issue
that
was
initially
presented,
namely
whether
you
needed
a
conflict
or
there
was
field
preemption,
without
first
deciding...
it
bore
upon
that
question
whether
the
field
you're
talking
about
was
the
entirety
of
furc
jurisdiction.
now,
is
that
same
situation
here
that
we
couldn't
resolve
the
other
issue
intelligently
without
first
reaching
the
apa
coverage
issue?
justice
scalia
which
i
didn't
understand,
i
guess.
justice
scalia
well,
we'd
still
decide
the
zone
of
interest
thing
the
same
way.
i
mean,
we
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
affect
how
we
came
out
on
this
zone
of
interest
issue.
justice
scalia
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
zone
of
interest
test
maybe
shouldn't
be
applied,
but
we
could...
we
would
still
apply
it
correctly
even
though
it
might
be
unnecessary.
justice
scalia
but
you
don't
have
to
give
reasons
not
to
adopt
a
rule,
do
you?
you
have
to
give
reasons
to
adopt
one,
and
that's,
i
guess,
if
you
have
no
data,
you
don't
adopt.
justice
scalia
before
you
move
on,
can
i
ask
another
question
about
the
same
section?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
the
crucial
section?
it
seems
to
me
what
you
are
doing
is
claiming
the
benefit
of
the
monopoly,
and
this
is
a
section
authorizing
the
postal
service
to
eliminate
the
monopoly
as
to
certain
portions.
but
the
statute
that
you
claim
gives
you
the
protection
is
the
basic
conferral
of
the
monopoly
upon
the
postal
service.
justice
scalia
not
the
later
provision,
whenever
it
was
adopted,
allowing
an
exception
from
it.
justice
scalia
well,
you're
claiming
it
was...
you're
within
the
zone
of
interests
for
which
the
monopoly
was
designed.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
your
claim.
i
don't
see
how
the
exception
statute
does
anything
except
affect
the
scope
of
the
monopoly.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
how
that
follows.
it
just
depends
on
how
the
rate
is.
you,
you
can
provide
universal
service
at
uniform
rates
so
long
as
the
rate
is
high
enough.
justice
scalia
even
if
other
people
are
scream...
cream
skimming,
the
people
left
will
pay
the
freight.
justice
scalia
maybe
competition
might
determine
it,
too.
justice
scalia
determine
how
fast
rates
go
up,
as
it
does
in
other
segments
of
the
economy.
we're
talking
economics
here.
justice
scalia
but
the
employees
of
the
postal
service
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
that
that
actively,
as
you
say,
intended
to
protect?
justice
scalia
the
purpose
of
this
legislation,
of
establishing
the
post
office
is--
justice
scalia
--is
to
ensure
employment
to
people?
