mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
what
we
have
heard
this
morning,
let
me
begin
with
a
few
very
brief
points
of
clarification.
first,
the
context.
this
case
involves
a
federal
program
that
is
specialized.
it
is
not
medicaid.
it
is
not
community
health
services.
it
is
a
family
planning
program
and
which
the
secretary
views,
consistent
with
congress's
intent,
as
being
a
term
of
art.
it
means,
as
the
conference
committee
report
suggested,
preventive
services,
preconceptional
services.
it
does
not
mean
counseling
or
treating
a
pregnant
woman,
other
than
as
part
of
her
transition
out
of
the
family
planning
project,
the
title
x
project,
to
another
health
care
provider.
that
is
what
these
regulations
were
designed
to
do
in
response
to
criticisms
leveled
at
the
program
by
the
general
accounting
office,
by
the
inspector
general,
and
then
pursuant...
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
terms
of
the
orderliness
of
the
procedure.
there
was
a
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
here
which
was
responsive
to
the
very
kinds
of
concerns
that
had
been
identified
by
the
general
accounting
office.
that
is
to
say
the
secretary,
among
other
things,
had
proceeded
in
a
very
informal
way.
there
had
never
been
regulations.
there
had
only
been
informal
memoranda
from
the
office
of
general
counsel
which
were
responding
to
ad
hoc
requests
for
essentially
a
no-action
kind
of
letter
or
advice
and
the
like.
guidelines
were
finally
promulgated
in
1981.
those
guidelines
themselves
represented
a
shift
in
the
agency's
position.
frankly,
there
had
been,
prior
to
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
great
uncertainty
and
confusion
and
indeed
i
don't
overstate
it
by
saying
chaos
in
the
system
as
to
precisely
what
was
permitted
and
what
was
not.
and
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
and
throughout
the
secretary
made
it
very
clear
that
this
program
was
limited.
professor
tribe
has
quoted
from
the
federal
register.
let
me
share
one
very
brief
quote
as
well.
the
secretary
said...
this
is
at
52
federal
register
33.
2.11...
"as
clearly
contemplated
by
title
x
and
its
legislative
history,
family
planning
is
meant
to
address
plans
and
methods
for
facilitating
or
preventing
pregnancy,
not
for
terminating
it.
"
"as
such,
medical
services
or
counseling
relating
to
pregnancy
care
after
pregnancy
diagnosis
or
any
services
relating
to
abortion
as
a
method
of
family
planning
are
outside
the
scope
of
activity
supported
by
title
x
funds.
"
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
in
this
sense,
justice
o'connor.
the
secretary
did
come
to
the
view
that
the
kind
of
counseling
that
was
going
on
was
not
in
fact
consistent
with
the
secretary's
reading
of
section
1008,
and
at
a
minimum
with
the
purpose.
what
the
secretary
saw
as
the
purpose
was
not
to
encourage
or
promote
abortion,
and
that
was
being
done.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
at
the
time,
justice
o'connor,
for
this
reason.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
so.
as
odd
as
that
may
seem,
i
think
so
in
light
of
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
and
the
general
accounting
office
report
because,
justice
o'connor,
those--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
it
had
had
the
effect
of
promoting
or
encouraging
abortion,
then
i
believe
it
would.
we
would
owe
a
deference
to
the
secretary.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
exactly
right.
it
was
thought
that
non-directive
counseling
could
in
fact
be
consistent
with
the
mandate,
as
those
early
memos,
if
you
look
at
our
footnote
3,
the
carol
conrad
memorandum
said
very
clearly
that
promotion
and
encouragement
of
abortion
is
forbidden.
we
believe,
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
general
counsel
in
this
informal
setting...
this
is
not
the
secretary
speaking;
this
is
not
through
a
notice
and
comment
rulemaking;
this
is
an
important
lawyer's
opinion...
it
was
her
opinion
that
non-directive
counseling
was
consistent
with
that
goal.
the
secretary,
after
a
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
after
gao
criticism,
after
an
inspector
general
criticism,
said
that
is
not
so.
and
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
return
to
what
this
program
is
about,
which
is
preventive
care.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that's
problematic.
i
have,
frankly,
serious
doubts
that
the
secretary
could
have,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
resolve
that
definitively
here,
and
reasonable
minds
may
differ
on
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
especially,
justice
white,
and
getting
back
to
what
this
statute
is
all
about,
what
the
secretary
saw
is
that
this
is
a
statute
about
preventive
pre-conceptional
services,
that
is
to
say
providing
pregnancy
care
goes
beyond
the
statute.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
i
think
so.
the
secretary
has
long
felt
that
the
program
must
be
administered
in
a
humane,
compassionate
way
that
in
fact
attends
to
the
health
needs
of
the
individual
and
to
refer
that
person
to
an
appropriate
provider
of
medical
care.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
the
sense
of
transition,
transitional
referral,
and
providing,
i
think
the
regulation
goes
on,
justice
stevens,
to
say--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
it
requires
it.
i
think
that
the
secretary,
in
his
discretion,
has
determined
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
interpretation
there
must
be
a
transition
out
of
title
x
to
protect...
in
essence
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
the
referral
appointment
can
be
kept.
they
will
assist
in
keeping
the
referral
appointment.
and
to
ensure
that
the
status
quo
is
maintained
the
individual
is
given
necessary
information
to
protect
the
health
of
the
mother
and
of
the
unborn
child.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
there
is
an
emergency,
then
it
can
be.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
post-pregnancy
advice
is
terribly
limited.
it's
terribly
limited
because
of
the
humanity
of
the
situation.
the
individual
needs
to
get
to
an
appropriate
provider
of
health
care.
she
has,
as
it
were,
graduated
from
title
x.
if
the
individual
is
going
into
detailed
options
counseling,
providing
spock
on
baby
care
and
the
like,
showing
baby
care
materials
and
the
like,
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
title
x.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
so,
and
certainly
they
have
not
challenged
the
fact
that
the
individual
should
be
given
enough
information
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
that
short
period...
and
we
hope
it
would
be
a
very
short
period...
until
she
could
see
a
physician
who
is
in
fact
outside
of
the
title
x
program.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you
are
quite
right.
my
choice
of
terms
is
infelicitous.
to
maintain
the
circumstances
so
that
she
can
in
fact
get...
that
is
to
say,
if
she
needs
information.
you
are
pregnant.
you
should
now
in
fact
see
an
appropriate
provider
of
medical
care.
here
is
information
that
you
need
to
know.
i'm
scheduled
to
go
to
a
party
tomorrow
night,
and
i
tend
to
be
a
heavy
drinker.
it
is
completely
appropriate
for
the
physician...
and
of
course
this
is
typically,
the
counseling
is
typically
done...
and
i
think
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
realize
this...
by
health
care
practitioners,
by
nurses
and
nurse
practitioners,
are
entitled
to
say
here's
a
list
of
appropriate
care
providers,
but
at
that
party
don't
drink
at
all
because
you
may
damage
your
health,
you
may
damage
the
health
of
the
unborn
child.
that
is
appropriate,
the
secretary
has
determined,
in
his
interpretation
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
here
by
virtue
of
the
secretary
following
the
very
path
that
was
laid
down
by
the
court
in
fcc
v.
league
of
women
voters.
that
is
what
the
program
integrity
requirements
are
all
about.
so
that
to
maintain
the
abortion
neutrality
of
the
title
x
program,
to
keep
abortion
out
of
that
program
entirely,
the
secretary,
through
the
59.9
integrity
regulations,
permits
the
establishment
of
a
separate
vehicle.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
certainly
tilts
against
abortion.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
what
the
program
integrity
requirements
permit
is
complete
non-neutrality.
that
is
to
say,
the
grantee...
that
is
why
the
secretary
was
quite
precise
in
drawing
the
line
between
the
title
x
program
or
project
and
the
grantee.
the
grantee
is
at
liberty
to
have
an
abortion
services
clinic
and
the
like
to
provide
abortion-related
information,
to
provide
abortion
counseling.
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
league
of
women
voters
was
in
fact
permissible,
following
the
lead
of
what
the
court
indicated
in
reagan
v.
taxation
with
representation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly,
justice
kennedy.
that
is
the
precise
point.
this
is
a
limited
program.
the
prohibition
runs
only
to
the
program,
and
that
is
what
takes
this
out
of
the
unconstitutional
conditions
line
of
cases.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
if
in
that
latter
capacity
that
provider's
principal
purpose
or
principal
business
is
the
providing
of
abortions.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
the
list
that
can
be
provided,
justice
kennedy,
i
wouldn't
focus
on
that
one
provider.
the
list
is
to
be
in
fact
a
global
list,
leaving
out
only
one
kind
of
entity,
and
that
is
entities
whose
principal
business
is
the
providing
of
abortions.
there
can
in
fact
be
providers
on
that
list
who
do
provide
abortions,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
that
is
entirely
correct.
in
fact,
part
of
the
theme
that
we
have
heard,
justice
white,
is
that
there
is
distortion,
there
is
trickery.
there
should
be
none
at
all.
if
the
program
is
proceeding
with
integrity,
as
it
should,
it
will
be
up
front
with
the
clients
of
the
title
x
project
and
say
we
do
not
counsel
with
respect
to
abortion
as
a
method
of
family
planning.
we
do
not
refer
to
clinics
whose
principal
business
is
the
providing
of
abortions.
what
we
are
going
to
give
you,
now
that
you
have
been
diagnosed
as
pregnant,
is
a
comprehensive
list
and
on
this
list
are
appropriate
providers
of
medical
care
to
protect
the
health
of
the
mother
and
the
unborn
child.
and
on
that
list
there
can
in
fact
be
providers
who
do
provide
abortions.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
part
b
does,
part
a
does
not.
to
say
in
part
a
of
your
hypothetical
your
health
is
in
danger,
you
do
need
treatment,
that
is
absolutely
fine,
and
to
refer
the
person
to
an
emergency
provider
of
medical
services
is
fine.
to
actually
go
forward,
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
and
to
counsel
you
need
an
abortion
is
beyond
the
mandate.
and
the
person
can
say,
the
health
care
provider
can
say,
i'm
not
going
to
trick
you.
i'm
not
going
to
deceive
you.
this
is
important.
here
is
a
list.
in
fact,
i
need
to
get
you
over
for
emergency
care,
but
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
be
counseling
with
respect
to
the
appropriate
medical
treatment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
problem
is
the
context,
that
that
advice
is
being
given
in
the
context
of
a
title
x
family
planning
program.
and
in
fact
the
secretary
reasonably
reads
the
1008
prohibition
that
the
goal
that
congress
had
in
what
was
inherently
a
controversial
program
is
let's
not
bring
abortion
and
the
abortion
controversy
into
the
program.
we
have
made
the
decision
to
bring
contraceptives
in.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
at
that
point
the
person,
the
physician
in
your
hypothetical...
i
think
it
is
an
extreme
hypothetical,
but
accepting
it
and
facing
it...
i
think
in
that
hypothetical
the
physician
has
transcended
the
boundaries
of
title
x.
his
title
x
hat,
family
planning
services,
is
on.
once
he
steps
out
of
that
hat
and
begins
treating
the
individual's
pregnancy,
he
is
providing
a
different
kind
of
medical
care
beyond
the
scope
of
title
x,
quite
apart
from
abortion.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
you
have
to
provide
medical
care
that
is
needed
during
that
interim
period...
i
won't
use
status
quo...
during
the
interim
period
when
an
appointment
is
to
be
made.
the
key
is
make
an
appointment,
and
that's
what
i
think
the
regulations
suggest.
make
an
appointment
with
an
emergency
provider
of
services,
and
you
can
assist
the
person
in
making
sure
that
that
emergency
appointment
is
in
fact
kept.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
the
program
is
prescribing
professional
speech,
if
i
accept
your
hypothetical
as
not
in
fact
permitting
what
the
secretary
contemplated
to
take
place.
here
is
what
the
secretary
contemplated...
that
in
cases
in
which
emergency
care
is
required...
that's,
i
think,
what
we
are
dealing
with...
a
title
x
project
shall
be
required
only
to
refer
the
client
immediately
to
an
appropriate
provider
of
emergency
medical
services.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
may
very
well
be.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
the
last
part
of
the
hypothetical.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
the
physician
is
at
liberty
to
provide
medical
information
that
is
necessary,
and
so
i
think
that
the
physician
in
that
hypothetical
could
respond,
provide
that
physician's
best
medical
judgment,
as
long
as
the
physician
does
not
in
fact
steer
the
patient
in
the
direction
of
an
abortion,
but,
rather,
steers
the
patient
in
the
direction
of
an
appropriate
care
provider.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that,
in
my
judgment,
that
goes
beyond
what
is
permitted
under
title
x.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
he
should
not
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
be
in
the
business
of
treating
pregnancy
and
caring
for
the
person
in
her
pregnant
condition.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
the
regulations
by
their
terms
rule
that
out.
it
simply
says
emergency
and
an
appropriate
provider
of
emergency
services.
at
that
point,
the
health
of
and
welfare
of
the
mother
are
paramount,
and
the
physician
must
in
fact
make
the
appropriate
referral
to
an
emergency
provider.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
i
think
that
the
physician
can
in
fact
alert
the
individual
to
a
potential
medical
problem.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
at
that
point
the
physician
may
very
well
be
going
beyond
what
title
x
is
all
about.
as
an
enforcement
matter,
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
goes
beyond
the
terms
of
the
statute.
whether
an
enforcement
action
would
be
brought
is
quite
another
thing.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
disagree
with
that.
on
your
tonsils
example,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
a
de
minimis
approach
that
is
unobjectionable.
with
respect
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
i
think
that
the
physician
is
simply
going
beyond
what
title
x
is
all
about.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
will
violate
the
terms
of
the
grant,
because
the
grant
is
in
fact...
they
are
funding
this
physician
to
provide
title
x
services.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
terms
of
what...
oh,
i
didn't
say
that
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
at
all.
there
may
have
been...
there
are
all
kinds
of
violations.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
program
may
be
the
subject
of
an
audit
and
then
appropriate
action
taken,
which
could
include
not
renewing
the
grant.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
it
might,
because
the
individual
is
at
that
point
transcending
title
x.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
precisely
why
i
was
suggesting
the
possibility
of
a
de
minimis
exception.
that
is
to
say
there
is
no
rule
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--individuals
are
coming
in,
exactly,
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
family
planning.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
the
individual
can
again
be
referred
out.
i
think
we're
talking
about
here
is
what
you
should
do.
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
as
i
understand
it,
the
physician
is
saying
i
am
here
as
a
title
x
physician,
but
i
am
telling
you
to
go
have
your
tonsils
out.
the
individual
is,
it
seems
to
me,
at
that
point
practicing
beyond
the
scope
of
the
program.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
he
certainly
is
able
to
say
i
have
spotted
a
tonsils
problem
and
you
should
go
have
it
attended
to.
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
project
to
tell
you
exactly
what
you
should
do,
but
we
will
assist
you
in
finding
an
appropriate
health
care
provider.
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
on
the
unconstitutional
conditions
point.
much
has
been
said
about
perry
against
sindermann
and
the
line
of
cases
that
suggest
that
the
government
cannot
in
fact
require
someone
to
give
up
a
liberty
as
a
condition
for
a
particular
kind
of
benefit...
speiser
against
randall
and
the
like.
that,
as
i
was
saying
before
the
colloquy,
about
what
the
regulations
permit,
is
exactly
why
the
secretary
has
the
program
integrity
requirements,
to
permit
these
kinds
of
services
to
be
permitted
through
a
separate
vehicle,
and
by
virtue
of
that
there
is
in
fact
no
extension
of
the
prohibition
beyond
the
program
itself.
the
prohibition
is
entirely
program-specific,
and
by
virtue
of
that
there
is
no
unconstitutional
condition
that
is
being
mounted
or
imposed
upon
these
individuals
and
on
these
clinics.
above
all,
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
the
law
assumes
a
robust
common
sense,
and
a
robust
sense
that
individuals
are
in
fact
free
to
determine
whether
to
participate
in
a
government
program
or
not.
the
secretary
fashioned
a
program
that
was
true
to
congress's
intent,
as
reflected
in
1008
and
in
the
statements
of
legislators
and
the
conference
committee
report,
that
this
program,
to
have
integrity,
must
in
fact
be
a
preventive
services
preconceptional
program.
i
thank
the
court.
