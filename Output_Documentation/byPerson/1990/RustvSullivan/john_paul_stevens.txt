justice
stevens
mr.
tribe,
have
you
made
a
complete
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
of
why
wouldn't
it
not
be
equally
viewpoint-neutral
for
these
people
to
advise
the
use
of
contraceptives?
justice
stevens
yes,
to
take
the
position
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
people
that
visit
the
clinics
to
use
contraceptives.
isn't
that
advocating
a
viewpoint,
too?
justice
stevens
general
starr,
can
i
ask
you,
on
that
very
point,
the
regulations,
at
least
as
quoted
in
the
briefs,
say
that
once
a
client
served
by
a
title
x
project
is
diagnosed
as
pregnant,
she
must
be
referred
for
appropriate
prenatal
and/or
social
services
by
furnishing
a
list
of
available
providers
that
promote
the
welfare
of
the
mother
and
the
unborn
child.
is
that
provision
authorized
by
the
statute?
justice
stevens
so
the
statute
does
require
some
post-pregnancy
counseling?
justice
stevens
but
this
is
not?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
the
status
quo.
the
status
quo
is
she
is
pregnant.
[laughter]
she
doesn't
need
advice
to
stay
pregnant.
justice
stevens
may
i
expand
on
that?
supposing
the
case
is
not
one
of
emergency
at
the
time
of
the
conference
but
in
the
doctor's
professional
judgment
unless
steps
are
taken
within
30
days
there
is
a
danger
of
an
emergency,
and
he
thinks
the
appropriate
way
of
avoiding
that
danger
is
to
at
least
consider
abortion
as
an
option.
what
is
he
supposed
to
do
under
the
regulations?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
doctor's...
how
much
freedom
does
the
doctor
have
to
explain
to
the
patient
that
in
the
next
30
days
you
ought
to
have
some
tests
to
see
whether
or
not
it's
appropriate
to
have
an
abortion,
because
that
may
be
the
only
way
to
avoid
a
risk
that
is
not
today
an
emergency
but
may
become
an
emergency
in
three
weeks?
justice
stevens
well,
but
may
the
physician...
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
"steer"...
may
the
physician,
as
a
part
of
his
or
her
explanation
of
the
problem,
say
that
the
reason
i
want
you
to
see
some
other
professional
is
i
think
it
may
be
appropriate
to
avoid
this
danger
by
getting
an
abortion?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
again
assuming
it
is
not
an
immediate
emergency
but
a
concern
about
30
days
from
now,
could
the
doctor
say
i
just
happened
to
notice
this,
i
think
you
ought
to
have
your
tonsils
taken
out?
i'm
serious
about
that.
justice
stevens
and
suggest
the
proper
solution,
in
his
or
her
judgment?
justice
stevens
it's
no
longer
family
planning,
but
is
it
something
that
the
statute
would
prohibit
the
doctor
from
doing?
justice
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
do
you
think
the
statute
would
prohibit
the
doctor
from
giving
medical
advice
that
is
not
specifically
authorized
by
the
statute
or
contemplated
within
the
notion
of
family
planning?
he
just
sees
a
problem
with
the
patient
and
says,
look,
i
think
this
is
what
you
should
do.
my
understanding
is
he
can
give
any
medical
advice
he
wants
to,
except
that
he
cannot
say
that
i
think
an
abortion
is
indicated.
justice
stevens
well,
say
it's
appendix
or
say
it's
major
surgery,
you
ought
to
have
a
bypass
operation.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are...
if
it's
important,
can
he
do
it
and
unimportant
not?
is
that
your
notion?
justice
stevens
i
understand
he's
going
beyond
what's
been
authorized.
i'm
asking
if
it
violates
either
the
statute
or
the
regulations
to
give
that
kind
of
medical
advice.
justice
stevens
so
if
he
gave
that
kind
of
medical
advice
you
could
withdraw
the
grant
for
the
future?
justice
stevens
could
the
same
action
be
taken
if
he
gave
advice
to
have
a
tonsillectomy,
and,
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stevens
well,
does
it
happen
regularly
that
when
a
pregnant
person
comes
in
that
there's
a
medical
need
unrelated
to
family
planning
problems?
i
thought
you
said
that
was
the
rare
exception.
justice
stevens
just
if
a
doctor
sees
a
medical
problem,
is
the
doctor
permitted
to
tell
the
patient
about
the
existence
of
the
problem,
with
the
normal
recommended,
what
his
professional
advice
is.
i
guess
you
are
saying
no,
that
he
cannot.
