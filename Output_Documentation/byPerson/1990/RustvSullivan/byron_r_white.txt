justice
white
but
isn't
the
program
permitted
to
respond
to
a
question?
aren't
there
some
abortion
agencies
around?
aren't
they
permitted
to
identify
some
in
response
to
a
question?
justice
white
is
your
argument
now
suggesting
that
or
arguing
that
the
regulations
are
inconsistent
with
the
statute?
justice
white
you're
making
a
constitutional
argument
now.
justice
white
even
though
perhaps
we
should
deal
with
the
statutory
question
first?
justice
white
or
are
you
just
following
the
ordinary
rule
that
you're
arguing
your
strongest
point
first?
justice
white
and
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
white
so
this
is
a
first
amendment
argument?
justice
white
suppose,
professor,
that
the
doctor
gives
neutral
advice
or
is
permitted
to
give
this
neutral
advice
and
provide
all
the
information
and
then
the
patient
says,
well,
look,
i've
been
coming
to
you.
i
usually
want
your
opinion.
what
should
i
do
about
this?
you
say
that
the
statute
may
constitutionally
prevent
the
doctor
from
answering
that
question?
justice
white
well,
the
statute
would
forbid
it.
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
the
statute
was...
you
weren't
challenging
the
statute.
justice
white
you
don't
think
saying
my
opinion
is
you
should
have
an
abortion
is
promoting?
justice
white
well,
not
if
experience
had
shown
that
viewpoint-neutral
information
really
wasn't
consistent
with
the
statute.
justice
white
well,
the
lady
asks
the
doctor
in
one
of
these
federally-funded
organizations,
asks
the
doctor,
well,
could
you
tell
me
where
i
can
get
an
abortion.
and
he
says
no,
i
can't
tell
you
where
to
get
an
abortion.
but
i'll
tell
you
i'm
going
to
refer
you,
give
you
a
list
of
health
care
providers,
and
some
of
those
people
can
answer
questions
that
i
can't
answer.
is
that
all
right?
