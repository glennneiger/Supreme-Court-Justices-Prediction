mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
depend
upon
our
doctors
to
tell
us
the
whole
truth,
whoever
is
paying
the
medical
bill...
the
patient
or
the
government,
whether
in
a
title
x
clinic
or
in
the
bethesda
naval
hospital.
especially
when
a
medical
test
confirms
a
condition
that
we
had
worried
about,
we
all,
i
think,
rely
on
the
doctor
to
level
with
us
in
a
discussion
that
follows
the
diagnosis.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
supervise,
justice
kennedy.
they
are
not
always
the
personal
counselor,
but
under
the
title
x
regulations
they
are
responsible
for
supervision.
and
the
health
care
professionals
to
whom
women
speak,
whether
doctors
or
not,
are
ones
that
i
think
one
would
trust
to
tell
one
the
truth.
and
if
the
government
were
to
play
a
role
in
the
picture
i
think
we
would
assume
that
its
role
is
to
make
sure
that
nothing
relevant
is
left
out.
but
if
any
of
us
were
to
discover
that
the
government
instead
had
arranged
to
have
the
doctor
or
the
health
care
professional
omit
all
information
about
one
legally-available
medical
option
and
give
you
a
referral
list
that
is
clearly
tilted
in
the
direction
of
the
other
option,
regardless
of
what
dangers
there
might
be
to
your
health,
i
would
suppose
that
most
of
us
would
conclude
that
the
government
had
used
its
bargaining
power
to
betray
a
rather
basic
trust.
its
contract
with
the
doctor,
if
that
really
were
a
fair
description
of
the
situation,
would
violate
its
more
fundamental
contract
with
all
of
us,
including
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
by
conditioning
title
x
grants
on
the
regulations
that
we
challenge
in
this
case,
the
government,
in
the
words
of
judge
cardamone,
concurring
below,
sets
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
the
reason,
quite
simply,
is
that
under
these
regulations
not
even
the
petitioners'
private
funds,
sometimes
in
excess
of
three
times
the
size
of
the
federal
grant,
may
be
used
to
provide
uncensored
medical
information
to
the
patients
enrolled
in
the
petitioners'
title
x
family
planning
clinics.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
actually,
justice
scalia,
the
regulation
makes
reference
to
a
90-10
ratio,
but,
as
the
counsel
for
the
secretary
explicitly
conceded
in
oral
argument
in
the
first
circuit
at
footnote
59
of
the
planned
parenthood
brief,
it's
been
a
very
long
time
since
they
have
made
any
effort
to
live
up
with
that.
the
reason
has
been
that
as
federal
funds
have
diminished
and
as
the
government,
i
think
quite
understandably,
has
not
wanted
to
penalize
clinics
for
growing,
the
norm
now
is
that
the
title
x
program
project,
as
defined
under
59.2
of
the
regs,
is
typically
funded
at
a
level
of
50
percent
or
less,
as
the
secretary
conceded
in
the
first
circuit,
of
the
federal
funds.
so
that,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
the
clinics
in
this
case,
in
westchester-rockland
it's
about
23
percent,
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
new
york
it's
about
50.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
90-10
does
have,
actually,
a
statutory
origin,
and
there
is
some
confusion,
i
understand,
about
whether
the
statute
has
been
properly
construed
by
the
secretary
of
hhs
in
allowing
the
reach
of
the
federal
hand
to
exceed
this
10
percent
federal
fisk.
but,
in
any
event,
there's
no
dispute
that
the
entire
program...
the
family
planning
program
at
the
hub
in
the
bronx,
the
family
planning
program,
including,
as
the
regs
call
it,
the
comprehensive
coherent
set
of
plans
and
program...
including
the
private
money,
is
encumbered
by
these
regulations.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
has
been
argued
in
various
courts.
it
is
still
not
resolved.
i
would
say
that
much
of
our
argument
is
completely
independent
of
whether
the
private
funds
are
10
percent
or
50
percent,
because
we
will
be
arguing
that
in
this
case
the
regulations
are
sufficiently
viewpoint-based
that
it
would
not
be
permissible
for
the
government
to
impose
them,
even
as
a
condition
of
expending
its
own
funds.
but
when
i
reach
that
point,
justice
scalia,
i
think
i
will
be
adding
a
couple
of
thoughts
about
the
way
in
which
those
arguments
relate.
the
government
actually
claims
no
general
authority,
even
with
its
own
money,
to
trick
patients
about
their
medical
situation
after
they
have
come
to
trust
a
doctor
in
a
government-assisted
clinic,
and
they
certainly
don't
affirmatively
claim
that
with
respect
to
private
funds
they
have
the
power
to
do
that.
their
basic
claim
is
quite
different.
their
claim
is
that
once
the
client
is
diagnosed
as
pregnant
the
title
x
program,
the
provision
of
services,
is
over,
so
that
the
further
discussion
that
might
be
had
about
abortion
is
simply
outside
the
scope
of
the
program.
i
think
the
fairest
way
to
respond
to
that
is
simply
to
say
that
it
just
is
not
the
case.
much
of
section
59.8
of
the
regulations
is
expressly
directed
to
post-conception
services,
with
only
abortion
counseling
and
referral
banned.
the
section
details
the
kind
of
information
that
a
title
x
client
must
be
given
once
pregnancy
is
diagnosed,
and
indeed
under
the
original
version
of
the
regulations
it
had
said,
and
i
quote,
"no
medical
services
or
counseling
after
pregnancy
is
diagnosed.
"
would
be
allowed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that's
incorrect.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
neither.
that
is,
president
bush,
when
a
member
of
congress,
was
one
of
the
leading
co-sponsors
of
this
law,
and
he
said
that
the
health
care
service
mechanism
that
he
had
in
mind
was
not
just
a
population
control
mechanism.
it
should
include
an
annual
physical
examination,
and
the
regulations
themselves
have
contemplated
and
the
statute
has
said
from
the
beginning
that
one
must
provide
more
than
just
a
kind
of
pregnancy
kit
and
see
you
later.
and
indeed
the
original
version
was
objected
to
on
the
dramatic
ground
that
it
would
permit
no
"counseling
which
discourages
abortion".
the
secretary
explained
at
53
federal
register
2926
that
that
is
why
the
current
version
does
not
contain
any
language
suggesting
that
the
program
finishes
when
pregnancy
is
diagnosed.
the
aim
was
put
very
clearly
in
52
federal
register
at
33.2.12,
and
i
quote:
"the
express
purpose"...
and
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
regulations
about
how
the
dialogue
after
diagnosis
is
to
proceed...
"is
to
ensure
title
x
projects
do
not
provide
counseling
relating
to
the
issue
of
medical
indication
for
abortion.
"
that
was
the
express
purpose.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
scalia.
i
am
sorry.
if
i
left
that
impression,
i
surely
did
not
mean
to.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
justice
scalia.
the
concept
of
family
planning
under
the
program
is
a
somewhat
broader
concept
than
would
be
suggested
by
a
kind
of
truck
stop
pregnancy
test.
that
is,
many
of
these
women
are
enrolled
throughout
their
reproductive
lives.
when
they
are
diagnosed
as
pregnant,
the
statute
and
the
regulations
in
fact
do
not
authorize
the
provision
to
these
women
of
the
gynecological,
obstetrical,
prenatal
and
other
services
that
they
might
need.
but
the
idea
is
that
an
important
part
of
the
program
is
not
simply
to
put
them
out
on
the
street
without
advice,
without
information.
it
is
at
that
point
to
have
a
discussion
with
them
about
the
options
available,
and
in
that
discussion
the
regulations
are
quite
clear
in
specifically
prohibiting
even
neutral
discussion
about
one
option,
namely
abortion,
and
at
the
same
time
mandating
with
respect
to
the
other
option
in
this
mutually-exclusive
pair
of
medical
choices,
mandating
the
provision
of
a
prenatal
list,
a
list
of
prenatal
care
centers,
which
under
the
regulations
must
include
all
prenatal
care
providers
in
the
area,
must
exclude
all
clinics
specializing
in
abortion,
and
must
be
limited
to
clinics
that
are
committed
to
the
welfare
both
of
the
unborn
child
and
of
the
mother.
so
that
the
message,
quite
plainly,
of
your
doctor
handing
you,
after
a
pregnancy
diagnosis,
a
list
of
this
sort
and
saying
this
is
a
list
of
places
that
will
be
concerned
with
you
welfare
and
that
of
the
unborn
child
is
basically
that
your
welfare
is
not
endangered
by
the
birth
of
the
child,
and
the
implicit
message
is
that
abortion
needn't
concern
you.
and,
indeed,
if
the
woman
asks
she
may
be
told
that
the
project
does
not
consider
abortion
an
appropriate
method
of
family
planning.
so
this
is
all
quite
obviously
reassuring,
but
it
is
not
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
they
are
not,
justice
white.
that
is,
what
would
be
steering
and
referral
in
clear
violation
of
the
regulations.
they
are
allowed
to
say...
they
would
be
allowed
to
hand
the
woman
a
copy
of
the
regulations,
i
suppose,
although
that
might
be
said
to
be
handing
her
material
that
could
be
encouraging
of
abortion.
i
would
hope
not.
if
they
hand
her
that
list...
that
is,
the
information
on
how
the
list
is
composed...
she
will
understand
that
by
coincidence
there
might
be
some
abortion
providers
in
the
area,
but
even
if
they
include
a
hospital
which
might,
for
example,
provide
abortion,
the
federal
register
53
at
page
29.38
says
that
the
referral
must
be
specifically
made
to
its
prenatal
care
service.
so
that
if
the
woman
finds
the
needle
in
the
haystack
it's
not
going
to
be
by
the
government's
design.
indeed,
the
secretary,
below,
said
it
was
designed
to
have
no
loopholes.
and,
when
asked
below
whether
the
woman
could
be
told
that
maybe
under
a
in
the
yellow
pages
she
would
find
something
that
could
be
relevant
to
her,
the
government
said
no.
and
two
of
the
three
judges
below
said
that
that
would
probably
be,
in
their
view,
impermissible.
so
this
is
not
a
neutral--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
we
have
argued
throughout
that
the
regulations
go
way
beyond
the
statute,
but
i'm
now
arguing
that,
even
if
they
didn't,
that
a
government
command--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
and
we're
saying
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we'd
be
entirely
happy
to
have
you
say
that,
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
the
best
rule.
one
sometimes
wants
to
wind
up
and
finish
with
a
bang.
[laughter]
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
it's
partly
because
of
the
constitutional
doubt
about
these
regulations
that
we
would
not
suggest
that
the
normal
rules
of
chevron
in
deferring
to
the
hhs
are
appropriate.
and
because
of
that
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
constitutional
cloud
seems
sufficiently
ominous
one
might
simply
read
the
statute
the
way
the
secretary
himself
read
it
for
the
first
11
years,
simply
to
permit
options
to
be
presented
to
the
woman
and
perhaps
the
way
it's
been
read
since
'81,
namely
to
require
the
neutral
provision
of
options,
but
not
the
way
these
regs
read
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
think
in
respect
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
that
permitting
options
to
be
presented
is
surely
constitutional.
the
part
where
i
am
not
as
certain...
we
were
never
in
a
position
to
challenge
it
because
the
clients
that
i
represent,
the
city,
the
state
of
new
york,
and
the
various
clinics
do
not
themselves
engage
in
encouraging
or
promoting
abortion...
but
insofar
as
that
was
a
viewpoint-based
limitation
i
suppose
an
argument
could
be
made
that
that
part
was
not
constitutional.
we
do
not
make
that
argument
here.
we
do
argue
that
when
in
respect
to
a
binary
choice
about
one's
medical
fate
the
government
suppresses
talk
about
one
branch,
even
neutral
talk,
and
mandates
steering
in
the
other
direction,
that
that
is
the
impermissible
suppression
of
information.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because,
i
guess,
as
justice
rehnquist
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
bolger
v.
youngs
drug,
the
central
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
prevent
the
suppression
of
information.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
strictly
a
first
amendment
argument.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
some
of
them
don't
seem
to
realize
that.
[laughter]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
difference...
it's
not
peculiar
to
the
medical
profession.
the
real
difference
is
that
some
people
serve
as
mouthpieces
for
the
state...
speechwriters,
spokespersons;
other
people
serve
as
professionals
in
whom
people
place
their
trust.
that's
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum.
and
we
suggest--
[laughter]
i
didn't
quite
mean
it
that
way.
the
point
really
is
that
the
people
in
title
x
clinics
look
like
doctors.
they
are
dressed
like
doctors.
they
act
like
doctors.
and,
therefore,
when
they
try
to
speak
like
doctors
the
fact
that
the
government
has
selectively
shaped
their
speech
has
first
amendment
significance
that
it
wouldn't
have
if
everyone
looked
at
them
and
said,
these
are
the
solicitor...
i
didn't
mean
the
solicitor
general--
the
surgeon
general
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
these
are
not
the
voice
of
america.
these
are
the
voice
of
medical
professionals.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
we
think
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
only
if
it
were
written
specifically
to
authorize
these
regulations;
otherwise,
excluding
abortion
from
this
funding
i
think
is
clearly
permissible
under
harris
and
under
mcrae.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
not,
justice
kennedy.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statute
is
most
plausibly
implemented
by
maximizing
the
autonomy
of
the
patient
and
by
steering
the
patient
in
neither
direction
but
by
suppressing
information
in
either
direction.
that
is,
i
would
think
that
the
most
obviously
constitutional
way
to
implement
it
is
to
permit,
as
the
secretary
did
until
1981,
or
to
require,
as
the
secretary
did
from
1981,
the
provision
of
a
neutral
set
of
options
so
that
the
person
can
make
an
intelligent
choice.
justice
white
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
not
wrong
to
make
a
recommendation.
it
is,
however,
consistent
with
a
program
designed
to
provide
information
and
not
designed
to
steer
people
toward
any
choice
to
insist
that
the
professional
stand
back
and
play
a
more
passive
role.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there's
no
doubt
that
the
doctor
could
say...
however,
if
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--total
viewpoint
neutrality
in
this
area
i
have
to
concede
is
difficult
to
achieve
because
the
very
fact
that
these
are
professionals
and
that
laws
of
informed
consent
surround
this
area
means
that
they
can
be
required
to
provide
information
without
which
an
informed
choice
can't
be
made.
as
justice
white
suggested
in
his
thornburgh
dissent,
the
average
person
has
no
one
but
his
or
her
doctor
to
look
to
for
these
matters.
and
that
is
why
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
and
the
american
medical
association
have
concluded
that
actually
abiding
by
these
regulations
would
be
profoundly
unethical,
and
that's
why
we
believe
it
would
be
malpractice
in
a
great
many
states.
that
is,
there
are
a
great
many
situations
generically
in
which
a
woman
has
no
way
of
knowing
when
she
comes
into
the
clinic
if
abortion
might
be
one
of
the
things
that
would
be
medically
relevant
to
her.
she
might
be
quite
opposed
to
it
morally,
and
yet
if,
for
example,
she
was
using
a
contraceptive
method
like
an
iud
which,
when
left
in
place
might
create
a
risk
of
a
spontaneous
second
trimester
and
possibly
fatal
abortion,
surely
that
is
something
that
she
would
be
entitled
to
know.
and
there
a
great
many
women
like
that.
there
are,
in
addition
to
that,
some
590,000
women
who
visited
title
x
clinics
in
1988
who
had
some
background
medical
complication...
whether
cancer
or
diabetes
or
hypertension
or
multiple
sclerosis
or
chronic
heart
disease...
who
might
have
no
idea,
as
most
people
do
not,
that
these
conditions
can
sometimes
be
induced
to
recur,
can
be
aggravated
by
the
continuation
of
a
pregnancy.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct.
justice
scalia,
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
she
is
worse
off.
it
really
goes
back,
in
a
way,
to
a
point
you
made
in
evans
and
ulman.
on
the
question...
well,
let
me
why
it
struck
me
at
the
time
as
making
a
similar
point,
and
i
guess
the
court
did
it
in
milcovitch.
it's
really
very
hard
for
a
disclaimer
to
undo
the
misimpression
that
can
result
from
something...
that
is,
the
evans
and
novak
column,
with
its
factual
misstatement,
shrouded
in
a
disclaimer
saying
this
is
opinion,
or
the
lorraine
daily
journal
or
milcovitch,
this
is
just
opinion.
the
fact
is
that
if
in
the
context
there
is
something
that
might
be
injuriously
misleading
to
the
reader
or
to
the
listener,
saying
don't
trust
all
of
what
i
say,
it
may
not
be
complete,
may
not
be
enough,
partly
because
a
woman
will
have
come
to
rely
on
this
doctor
over
the
years...
some
of
the
women
that
i
met
in
the
clinics
that
i
visited
had
gone
there
for
a
long
time.
this
is
not
just
a
one-stop
thing.
many
of
the
clinics,
by
statutory
design,
induce
reliance.
so
a
woman
relies
on
the
doctor
for
a
period
of
time.
the
doctor
says
i
see
you're
eight
weeks
pregnant.
here's
a
prenatal
referral
list.
the
woman
doesn't
have
any
idea
that
her
underlying
medical
condition
might
make
that
pregnancy
turn
into
a
really
serious
threat
to
her
health.
the
doctor
isn't
allowed
to
tell
her
that
it
might.
under
the
regulations,
that
would
be
promoting
the
termination
of
the
pregnancy.
she
walks
out
of
there
with
a
prenatal
referral
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
i
think
it
is
clear,
justice
scalia.
the
secretary's
explanation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
secretary's
official
explanation
of
the
regulations
said
that
they
were
designed
to
prevent
any
expression
of
medical
indication
for
pregnancy,
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
regulations
that
would
suggest
that
he
could
warn
her
in
that
way.
but,
in
any
event,
if
she
said,
well,
what
should
i
do
about
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
it's
made
clear
at
33.2.12
of
the
federal
register,
volume
52,
that
the
point
of
the
ectopic
pregnancy
example
is
simply
to
say
that
if
there
is
an
imminent
threat
to
life
they
cannot
refer
her
to
someone
who
might
do
an
abortion,
but
to
an
emergency
room.
but
the
reference
to
abortion
as
a
method
of
family
planning,
justice
scalia,
the
words
"family
planning"
i
think
have
no
meaning
under
the
government's
reading
of
the
statute
or
ours,
in
this
sense.
if
a
therapeutic
abortion,
an
abortion
for
reasons
of
health,
were
not
encompassed
within
that
concept,
then
there'd
be
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
even
prevent
the
use
of
federal
funds
directly
for
the
performance
of
abortion
to
protect
the
woman's
health.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
clearly
not
what
the
regulations
mean.
that
is,
the
regulations
are
clearly
designed
not
to
in
any
way,
as
59.10
says,
promote
or
encourage
abortion.
and
to
tell
her
that
if
you
remain
pregnant
it
might
hurt
your
health
is
surely
to
promote
or
encourage
abortion.
let
me
add,
though,
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
guess
answering
truthfully
what
his
opinion
is
in
a
way
that
does
not
steer
or
encourage
her...
these
are
lines
that
are
terribly
hard
to
draw,
which
is
why
the
government
oughtn't
to
be
in
the
business
of
editing
these
dialogues...
i
think
is
beyond
what
the
government
could
forbid.
but
what
it
tries
to
forbid
here--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
you
might--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
statute
would
forbid
encouraging
or
promoting,
not
necessarily
when
pressed
saying
his
own
truthful--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
white,
i
must
say
that
i
think
there
is
no
easy
way
to
figure
out
where
to
draw
that
line,
and
insofar
as
the
statute
is
read
to
control
speech
it
raises
a
profound
problem
in
any
event.
but
the
worst
problem
is
created
when
the
regulations
are
as
viewpoint-based
as
these
are.
that
is,
these
regulations
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
advocacy
and
literature
distribution
which
is
pro-choice
and
which
is
pro-life.
the
combined
effect
of
59.9
and
59.50
is
that
it
is
permissible
with
the
title
x
project,
quite
apart
from
this
dialogue,
to
engage
in
vigorous
advocacy
and
legislative
lobbying
in
favor
of
the
pro-life
position,
not
in
favor
of
the
pro-choice
position.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
why
it
would
not
be
viewpoint-neutral
to
advise?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
point
isn't
that
the
professional
cannot
advocate
a
viewpoint.
it's
that
the
government
cannot
suppress
a
particular
kind
of
information
in
the
dialogue,
and
that
it
cannot
create
a
viewpoint-based
tilt,
even
in
the
expenditure
of
its
money.
and
in
this
case,
if
i
might
remind
the
court,
given
how
much
private
money
is
also
burdened,
the
case
is
very
like
league
of
women
voters.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
regulations
do
suggest
that
the
full
range
of
options--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
that's
like
informed
consent,
justice
scalia.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
that
you
must
provide
the
person
with
the
full
range
of
options.
it
is
not
that
you
cannot,
if
asked,
tell
the
person
what
you
think
would
be
best,
but
you
are
not
supposed
to--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
the
court
had
before
it
a
challenge,
there
is
under
the
statute
a
conscientious
exemption.
that
is,
someone
cannot
be
forced
under
these
regulations
to
give
advice
that
violates
his
or
her
conscience
or
religion.
but
it's
true
that
any
program
that
has
programmatic
requirements
will
exclude
some
possible
providers.
a
drug
counseling
program
plainly
is
going
to
exclude
people
whose
opinion
is
that
there
should
be
no
drug
counseling
and
that
everyone
should
take
drugs.
but
here
it
is
not
as
though
a
plausibly
neutral
line
has
been
drawn
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
program.
what's
happened
is
that
truthful
information
that
may
be
relevant
is
being
deliberately
withheld
from
people
who
have
every
reason
to
expect
it
and
that,
on
top
of
that,
with
respect
to
advocacy,
with
respect
to
the
preparation
and
distribution
of
literature,
with
respect
to
the
leaflets
that
are
left
in
the
waiting
room,
there
is
a
censor
overseeing
the
entire
process,
saying
that
if
they
advocate
abortion
or
in
any
way
enhance
its
accessibility
or
its
availability,
the
regulations
have
been
violated.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
not
that
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
fund
them.
but
if
the
government
said--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--paid
for
by
private
funds,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
twr,
for
example,
when
you
wrote
that
the
line
that
was
drawn
by
the
government
with
respect
to
lobbying
was
acceptable
because
veterans
and
non-veterans
are
distinguishable
without
regard
to
viewpoint,
imagine
in
that
case
if
they
had
said
we
will
subsidize
pro-life
lobbying
but
not
pro-choice
lobbying.
now
the
government
does
not
have
the
power,
the
court
has
said
and
held
in
speiser
v.
randall,
to
make
a
financial
benefit
available,
even
if
it's
a
government
subsidy,
based
on
the
viewpoint
expressed.
it's
particularly
not
permissible
for
the
government,
as
it
does
here,
to
say
that
all
of
the
literature
and
all
of
the
material,
even
if
paid
for,
as
in
the
case
of
many
of
these
clinics,
fully
by
non-federal
funds,
must
be
expelled
from
the
project.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
it
makes
a
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
they
attempt
to
extend
their
quite
limited
power
to
assure
how
federal
dollars
are
spent.
that
is,
otherwise
it
could
have
been
said
in
league
of
women
voters
that
because
the
parent
organization
could
always
go
off
and
put
the
same
editorial
on
cbs
or
could
publish
it
somewhere
else
with
its
own
money
that
its
private
money
was
therefore
not
encumbered.
but
this
court
did
not
take
that
view.
i
had
meant
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
