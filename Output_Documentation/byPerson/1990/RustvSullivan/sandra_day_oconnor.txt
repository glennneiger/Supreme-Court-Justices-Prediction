justice
o'connor
mr.
tribe,
do
you
concede
that
the
way
the
secretary
originally
interpreted
it
is
constitutional?
justice
o'connor
general
starr,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
way
the
program
was
being
run
before
these
current
regulations
went
into
effect
somehow
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position
that
compliance
with
the
memos
that
had
been
sent
in
prior
years
in
response
to
questions
about
providing
neutral
information
was
itself
in
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
it
would
be
now,
but
not
then?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
o'connor
suppose
a
different
rule
had
been
adopted,
one
in
accordance
with
the
prior
memos?
would
that
be
invalid
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
i'm
not
sure
that's
responsive.
justice
o'connor
because
the
prior
memos
at
least
purported
to
say
viewpoint-neutral
information
may
be
given.
justice
o'connor
but
could
the
secretary
have
taken
the
position
of
that
earlier
response
and
been
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
