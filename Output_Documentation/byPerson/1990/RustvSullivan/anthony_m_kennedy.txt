are
doctors
always
involved
in
title
x
programs?
justice
kennedy
under
the
secretary's
former
interpretation,
the
one
that
you
would
like
us
to
in
effect
go
back
to,
suppose
this
medical
care
professional
said,
in
our
view,
from
your
standpoint
and
your
family
situation,
abortion
is
the
recommended
choice
for
family
planning,
and
we
urge
you
to
have
an
abortion
and
here
is
the
name
of
a
place
where
you
can
obtain
that.
is
that
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
so
that
it's
wrong
to
make
a
recommendation
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
a
doctor
could,
under
your
view,
under
the
statute
as
now
interpreted
or
as
previously
interpreted,
strongly
recommend
contraception.
justice
kennedy
so
that's
not
viewpoint-neutral.
justice
kennedy
but
not
as
part
of
this
program.
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
medical
care
provider
in
the
title
x
program
ascertains
that
the
woman
is
pregnant.
that
provider
has
a
regular
practice
of
engaging
in
performing
therapeutic
abortions.
can
he
say
i
want
you
to
make
an
appointment
with
me
tomorrow
at
my
other
office,
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
some
advice?
justice
kennedy
then
you
are
saying
that
this
title
x
grantee
can
still
engage
in
abortion.
it's
really
meaningless.
this
woman
might
find
them
out.
she
might
not.
