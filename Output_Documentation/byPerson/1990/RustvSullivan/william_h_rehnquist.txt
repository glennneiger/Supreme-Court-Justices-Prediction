chief
justice
william
h.

we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in

mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
the
government
in
its
brief,
mr.
tribe,
and
perhaps
it
is
wrong,
seems
to
take
the
position
that
this
is
basically
a
pre-pregnancy
counseling
program.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
that
was
not
what
congress
intended,
or
that's
not
what
has
happened
in
fact?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
is
it
peculiar
to
the
medical
situation
here?
because
certainly
if
the
government
is
talking
about
the
secretary
of
state
hiring
a
press
or
public
information
officer
or
the
press
secretary
at
the
white
house,
the
press
secretary
or
the
public
information
officer
are
not
free
to
say
look,
i
want
to
tell
the
reporters
everything
i
know,
if
the
secretary
of
state
says
you
play
this
down.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
some
of
them
may
not
realize
it,
but
i
think
they'll
soon
learn.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
agree
that
is
not
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
challenge
the
statute,
though,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
first
amendment
prevents
the
government
from
refusing
to
fund
pamphlets
that
promote
abortion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
pamphlets
in
the
waiting
room
that
advocated
abortion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
constitutional
terms
whether
these
pamphlets
in
the
waiting
room
are
paid
for
by
private
funds
or
paid
for
by
federal
funds?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
haven't.
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
general
starr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases.
the
first
is
no.
89-1391,
rust
against
sullivan
with
a
companion
case.
title
x
of
the
public
health
service
act
provides
federal
funding
for
preconception
for
family
planning
services.
section
1008
of
the
act
specifies
that
none
of
the
funds
appropriated
for
family-planning
services
shall
be
used
in
programs
where
abortion
is
a
method
of
family
planning.
in
1988,
the
secretary
promulgated
new
regulations
designed
to
provide
clear
and
operational
guidance
to
title
x
grantees
about
how
to
preserve
the
distinction
between
title
x
programs
and
abortion
as
a
method
of
family
planning.
these
regulations
prohibit
title
x
projects
from
engaging
in
counseling
concerning
referrals
for
and
activities
advocating
abortion
as
a
method
of
family
planning
and
requires
such
projects
to
maintain
an
objective
integrity
and
independence
from
the
prohibited
abortion
activities
by
use
of
separate
facilities,
personnel,
and
accounting
record.
before
the
regulations
could
be
put
into
effect,
they
were
challenged
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
they
were
upheld
in
the
lower
courts
but
the
other
courts
of
appeals
held
otherwise
so
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
difference
of
opinion.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
uphold
the
secretary's
regulations
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
the
regulations
are
a
permissible
construction
of
title
x
because
section
1008
is
ambiguous
and
that
it
does
not
speak
directly
to
the
issue
of
abortion
counseling
referral
and
advocacy,
the
secretary's
construction
must
be
afforded
substantial
deference
as
the
interpretation
of
the
agency
charged
with
administering
the
statute.
we
also
find
that
the
regulations
do
not
violate
the
first
amendment
free
speech
rights
of
private
title
x,
recipients,
their
staffs
or
their
patients,
by
impermissibly
imposing
viewpoint-discriminatory
conditions
on
government
subsidies.
there
is
no
question
but
that
section
1008
itself
is
constitutional
and
the
government
is
not
required
to
fund
the
activities
which
are
constitutionally
protected.
we
also
hold
that
the
regulations
do
not
violate
a
woman's
fifth
amendment
right
to
choose
whether
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
the
government,
as
we
have
held
before,
has
no
constitutional
obligation
to
subsidies
an
activity
merely
because
it
is
constitutionally
protected.

blackmun

filed

dissenting
opinion

which,
