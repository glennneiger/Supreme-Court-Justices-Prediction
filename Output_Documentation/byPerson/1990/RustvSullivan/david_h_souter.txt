justice
souter
general,
what
do
you
say
the
statute
and
the
regs
permit
in
a
situation
in
which
the
object
is
not
simply
to
preserve
the
status
quo
but
the
situation
in
which
the
title
x
physician
in
the
course
of
his
consulting
or
examination
concludes
that
the
mother
is
pregnant
and
in
fact
is
in
some
imminent
danger
to
health?
in
that
case,
do
you
take
the
position
that
either
the
statute
or
the
regs
permit
the
title
x
physician
to
say
you
are
in
danger
to
health
as
a
result
of
your
pregnancy
and
one
appropriate
response
to
that
would
be
to
have
an
abortion
and
i
will
refer
you
to
a
hospital
or
a
physician
who
can
provide
it?
would
that
place
the
program
in
violation
of
either
the
statute
or
the
regs?
justice
souter
even
in
that
case
he's
not
counseling
for
the
purposes
of
family
planning.
he
is
in
fact
acting
as
a
physician
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
an
imminent
risk
or
removing
an
imminent
risk
to
the
patient's
health.
why
does
that
violate
the
statute
or
the
regs?
justice
souter
but
isn't
he
going
a
step
further?
isn't
he
saying,
if
he
follows
the
position
that
you
have
just
outlined,
isn't
he
saying
that
in
fact
if
a
title
x
physician
sees
a
professional,
a
standard
professional
need
or
obligation
to
give
advice
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
health
of
his
patient
from
imminent
danger,
and
in
giving
that
advice
he
is
not
giving
it
for
the
purposes
of
family
planning
but
simply
for
those
traditional
purposes,
that
too
is
forbidden?
doesn't
that
go
beyond
the
statute
and
the
regs?
justice
souter
but
in
my
hypothetical
the
interim
period
may
be
extraordinarily
short.
for
all
we
know,
the
high
blood
pressure
is
going
to
result
in
a
stroke
within
the
next
hour,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
telling
us
that
in
those
circumstances...
to
be
sure
that
is
not
what
title
x
was
concerned
with,
but
in
those
circumstances...
the
physician
cannot
perform
a
normal
professional
responsibility
which
is
outside
of
the
object
of
title
x
funding,
even
though
that
responsibility
does
not
violate
the
prohibition
against
using
abortion
counseling
for
family
planning.
i
think
you
are
telling
us
that
in
that
circumstance,
simply
because
it
is
outside
the
object
of
title
x,
the
secretary
in
effect
may
preclude
professional
speech.
justice
souter
it's
one
thing
to
say
it
may
be
required
only
to
do
that.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
he
may
be
precluded,
the
physician
may
be
precluded
from
something
else,
even
though
it
does
not
violate
the
condition
that
title
x
may
not
use
abortion
for
family
planning.
