justice
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
case,
so
long
as
those
funds
are
not
used
in
the
title
x
program.
the
title
x
program,
by
the
way,
is
how
much
federal
money?
it's
at
least
90
percent,
is
it?
justice
scalia
where
is
the
90-10
pulled
from?
justice
scalia
i
suppose
we
ought
to
evaluate
the
federal
statute
and
the
regulations
under
the
federal
statute
on
the
basis
of
what
congress
contemplated
when
it
passed
it,
and
congress
appears
to
have
contemplated
a
program
that
is
at
least
90
percent
federal
money.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
where
this
argument
is
going.
i
suppose
where
is
lead
is
since
the
only
prohibition
in
the
statute
is
a
prohibition
on
the
use
of
funds
in
programs
where
abortion
is
a
method
of
family
planning,
and
since
you
say
that
the
program
doesn't
just
authorize
family
planning
but
authorizes
medical
treatment
after
a
woman
is
pregnant,
then
there
really
is
no
prohibition
even
on
the
conduct
of
abortion.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
where
your
argument
leads.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
painting
with
a
very
broad
brush
when
you
say
that
the
program
is
not
just
a
program
of
family
planning.
justice
scalia
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
that
may
not
be
a
desirable
thing,
but
the
woman
is
in
no
worse
position
than
she
would
have
been
in
had
the
title
x
clinic
not
existed.
so
long
as
the
clinic
makes
clear
to
her
that
we
do
not
recommend
abortion,
we
are
not
in
that
business...
here
is
a
list
of
providers,
some
of
which
providers,
by
the
way,
can
provide
abortion
services...
they
are
not
excluded
from
referral,
are
they...
only
if
their
primary
business
is
the--
justice
scalia
--excuse
me.
is
it
clear
that
the
doctor
can't
tell
her
that,
that
the
pregnancy
may
create
a
serious
threat
to
her
health?
justice
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
scalia
you
see,
this
is
an
important
point
you
are
on
now.
i
read
the
regulations
as
preventing
any
referral
of
abortion
or
even
reference
to
abortion
as
a
means
of
family
planning,
but
i
think
they
draw
a
clear
line
between
abortion
as
a
means
of
family
planning
and
abortion
as
a
medical
necessity.
there
is
a
specific
reference
to
ectopic
pregnancy
in
one
of
the
exammples
that
they
give.
justice
scalia
well,
don'
the
regulations
prevent
the
hiring
of
advice-givers
who
say
the
only
form
of
family
planning
you
should
use
is
natural
birth
control?
you
should
not
use
artificial
birth
control.
isn't
that
forbidden
by
the
regulations?
justice
scalia
more
than
suggest.
it
has
to
provide
a
broad
range
of--
justice
scalia
--why
is
it
like
informed
consent?
it's
saying
you
can
only
give
one
advice.
you
cannot
advise
the
person
to
use
only
natural
family
planning.
justice
scalia
i
think
the
full
range
of
options
is
not
best.
i
think
you
should
only
use
one.
you
are
not
allowed
to
provide
that
kind
of
advice.
you
have
to
provide
the
full
range
of
options.
justice
scalia
never
mind
the
regulation.
where
does
the
statute
require
that
or
authorize
that,
for
that
matter?
justice
scalia
well,
then
why
would
it
prohibit
giving
necessary
health
information
in
that
rare
case
in
which
abortion
might
be
medically
indicated?
i
don't
understand
the
distinction.
justice
scalia
no,
it's
not
an
emergency,
but
it's
the
better
of
two
options
just
from
a
purely
medical
point
of
view,
not
for
any
family
planning
reason...
just
for
the
health
of
the
mother.
why
can
you
say
in
the
one
case
it's
appropriate
to
have
post-pregnancy
advice
and
the
other
it's
not
appropriate...
under
the
statute
only?
i'm
not
talking
constitutionally.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
an
abortion
neutrality.
it
is
the
one
thing
that
is
singled
out
that
shall
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
family
planning.
justice
scalia
the
secretary
requires
him
to
do
that,
as
justice
stevens'
question
earlier
demonstrated.
i
mean,
it's
the
secretary
that
says
you
have
to
provide
this
kind
of
medical
care
in
the
regs.
justice
scalia
well,
is
it
permitted
for
him
to
give
any
other
medical
judgment?
is
he
permitted
to
do
anything
but
refer?
i
mean,
suppose
he...
is
he
permitted
to
give
the
judgment,
in
my
opinion,
you
should
have
the
following
course
of
treatment?
justice
scalia
i
thought
he
can
only
refer.
justice
scalia
and
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
of
the
sort
justice
souter
was
referring
to
he
can
refer
even
to,
as
i
read
the
regulations,
even
to
an
agency
whose
principal
business
is
abortion.
justice
scalia
suppose
i
thought--
justice
scalia
--what
are
the
consequences
if
violating
the
regulation
about
abortion?
what
can
happen
to
the
doctor
for
doing
that?
justice
scalia
i
presume
you
would
certainly
terminate
the
grant
if
indeed
that
were
the
regular
practice,
that
people
were
coming
in
to
get
family
planning
advice
simply
because
at
the
end
of
it
the
doctor
said,
by
the
way,
while
you're
here,
let
me
look
at
your
tonsils.
and
they
were
regularly
treating
people
or
giving
advice
about
all
sorts
of
medical
conditions.
you
would
probably
terminate
the
program
in
that
event,
i
would
assume.
justice
scalia
with
respect
to
abortion
consultation,
that
is
much
more
likely
to
happen
regularly
than
is
advice
about
tonsils.
