mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
shapiro--
--does
the
government
take
a
position
as
to
whether
the
members
of
congress
who
are
appointed
to
this...
these
state,
or
state
boards,
or
this
board
set
up
by
the
states,
whether
their
term
on
the
board
survives
their
term
on
the
committee
in
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
coleman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coleman.
ms.
goldman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
goldman,
what
if
instead
of
the
transaction
we
have
here
congress
had
simply
said
we're
going
to
give
a
year-to-year
lease
to
the
metropolitan
airports
authority,
no
members
of
congress
on
the
review
board
at
all,
but
the
review
board
totally
independent
decides
to
abolish
parking
places
for
members
of
congress
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
and
the
chairman
of
the
house
commerce
committee
calls
the
members
of
the
review
board
over
about
a
month
before
the
first
year
of
the
lease
is
due
to
expire
and
he
says
i
really
don't
think
congress
is
going
to
renew
this
lease
if
you
do
that,
and
they
accordingly
change
their
mind.
now,
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
under
separation
of
powers
with
that,
would
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
ms.
goldman.
there
are
six
congressional
regions
of
the
smithsonian,
and
i
presume
they
act
in
their
individual
capacity,
don't
they?
they're
not
acting
as
a
member
of
congress
or
as
a
member
of
a
congressional
committee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
distinction
are
we
talking
about
here
then,
between
acting
in
one's
individual
capacity
and
one's
presumably
official
capacity?
is
that
the
alternative?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
goldman,
do
you
think
this
statute
offends
more
against
separation
of
powers
within
the
federal
government
or
more
against
federalism,
federal-state
relationships?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we're
not
talking
about
federalism
then
in
the
sense
of
south
dakota
against
dole?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
goldman.
mr.
coleman,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-906,
metropolitan
washington
airports
authority
versus
citizens
for
abatement
of
aircraft
noise
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens
