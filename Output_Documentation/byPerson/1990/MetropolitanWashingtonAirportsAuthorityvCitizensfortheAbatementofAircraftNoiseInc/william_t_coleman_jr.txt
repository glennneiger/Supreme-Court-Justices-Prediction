mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
basic
issue
here
is
are
the
congresspersons
who
under
the
statute
act
in
their
individual
capacities
as
members
of
the
state-created
review
board,
quote,
"officers
of
the
united
states",
end
quote,
or
as
review
board
members
do
they
exercise
any
federal
power
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
if
the
answer
to
these
two
questions
is
negative,
as
it
clearly
is,
then
the
authority's
governing
scheme
created
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
does
not
violate
present
federal
separation
of
power
doctrine.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
review
board
members
do
not
exercise
any
federal
power.
the
transfer
act
so
states.
the
statutes
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
so
state.
the
review
board
got
all
of
its
power
and
was
created
under
bylaw
4,
which
is
on
page
152
of
the
record,
and
therefore
they
are
not
exercising
state
power.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
in
the
first
place,
your
first
question
is
directed
to
the
appointment.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
speaker
suggests
the
name.
it's
up
to
the
board
of
directors,
the
state
agency,
to
select.
and
mistretta
and
bowsher
each
teach
that
where
there's
the
governmental,
the
congress
who
suggests
the
name,
but
if
the
appointing
authority
has
the
discretion
to
select
among
that
group,
then
you
don't
have
violation
of
article...
the
article
ii,
section
2,
clause
2.
so
therefore,
even
if
those
people
are
suggested
by
the
speaker,
the
fact
that
they
are
appointed
by
the
board
takes
away
that
problem.
with
respect--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that
would
make
it
a
harder
case.
but--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
it
may
be
harder,
some
of
them...
one
of
the--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--so
that's
a
harder
case.
but
if
the
determination
is
that
they
are
selected
by
state
people
and
they
are
not
exercising
state
power,
then
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution.
in
a
constitutional
debate
it's
dramatic
the
extent
to
which
the
people
struggle
to
make
sure
that
a
federal
official
still
had
the
right
to
serve
in
state
office.
and
that's
what
happened
here.
now,
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
our
position,
it
is
clear,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is
no
power
of
removal
by
the
congress.
and
the
fact
that
they
used
the
word
de
facto
reminds
me
of
that
justice
jackson
opinion
where
he
says
if
we
use
a
word
like
quasi,
you
know
that
you're
really
covering
up
a
disorderly
bad,
because
clearly
you're
saying
you
want
to
[inaudible].
here
the
statute
says
only
that
the
nominees
shall
consist
of.
secondly,
the
lease
which
you
have
to
read
says
it
shall
be
made
up
and
selected
from
the
list
of.
thirdly,
they
are
appointed
for
a
specific
term.
and
as
you
know,
chief
justice,
in
your
appointment
with
smithsonian,
you
were
appointed
but
you
lose
office
the
moment
you're
no
longer
chief
justice.
that's
in
the
statute.
that's
not
in
this
statute
here.
fourthly,
the
appointing
authority,
namely
the
board
of
directors,
specifically
say
that
they
can
be
removed
for
cause.
so
i
think
under
all
of
your
cases
it
is
clear
here
that
you
have
to
find
that
once
these
people
are
appointed
by
the
board
of
directors,
they
cannot
be
removed
by
the
congress,
and
they
can
only
be
removed
by
the
board
of
directors
or
state
agency.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
this
case
here.
the
moment
you
said
officio--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--no,
but
there
is
in
your
cases,
your
honor.
i
think
mistretta
is
right
on
the
point.
there
the
statute
says
a
person
had
to
be
an
article
iii
judge,
but
yet
you
held
the
fact
that
they
were
an
article
iii
judge
didn't
mean
that
once
nominated
by
the
head
of
the
judicial
conference
that
the
president
couldn't
select
them,
and
by
selecting
them
that
they
were
not
functioning
as
article
iii
judges.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
would
know
more
about
that
case
than
the
other
people
because
you
dissented.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
the
nine
persons
are
selected
from
the
group
of
107
congressmen
and
47
senators.
and,
but
they
are
appointed
by
a
state
agency,
and
therefore
they
are
exercising
state
power.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
but
they,
but
the
statute
says
no,
he
serves
in
his
individual
capacity.
what
you're
saying
is
the
people
that
pass
the
statute
are
going
to
violate
the
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
that
happened,
if
that
happened
you
may
well
then
have
a
grounds
for
removing
him
for
cause.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
can
we
look
to
the
practical?
here
you
have
a
situation
where,
whatever
is
happening,
there
is
no
power
being
exercised
on
any
other
federal
branch
of
the
government.
too,
here,
you
have
the
executive
agreeing
and
standing
up,
not
only
negotiating
this
in
the
lease,
but
in
addition
signing
the
statute,
but
standing
up
at
the
bar
of
this
court
saying
that
this
does
not
in
any
way
infringe
on
my
executive
power.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
there
is
no
case,
your
honor,
there
is
no
case
where
you
have
ever
held
that
there
was
an
incursion
on
the
executive
power
when
the
executive
stands
up
at
the
bar
of
this
court
and
says
my
power
is
not
being
intruded
upon.
secondly,
there
is
no
case
where
you
have
ever
determined--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
but
in
the
case
that--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--but
the
chadha
case
he
stood
at
the
bar
of
this
court--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--and
said
it
wasn't
all
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
in
addition--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--they
can
change.
but
as
you
know,
that
justice
powell
in
the
nixon
v.
gsa
said
that
once
the
executive
stands
up
to
the
bar
of
the
court
and
says
that
my
powers
are
not
being
infringed
upon,
that
that
in
itself
should
cause
the
court
to
give
great
weight
to
whether
you're
going
to
strike
down
the
statute.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
clear
here
that
the
power
of
appointment
is
in
the
state
board.
it's
equally
clear
that
the
congress
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
remove
these
people.
we
make
it
clear
in
our
brief
that
using
the
words
"consist
of"
in
other
federal
statute
doesn't
mean
that
once
the
person
is
appointed
he
or
she
loses
his
job
if
he
no
longer
holds
the
office.
you
also
have
the
fact
that
the
federal
statutes,
when
they
want
to
mean
that,
say
that.
this
one
doesn't.
also,
here
the,
the
state
makes
it
clear
that
it
has
the
power
of
removal.
and
we
say
under
your
cases
where
if
you're
struggling
with
the
power
of
interpretation,
if
you
can
interpret
the
statute
in
a
constitutional
way,
you
should
do
that
rather
than
to
interpret
it
in
a
way
which
i
really
don't
think
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
in
addition,
there
was
a
lease
created
here,
and
that
lease
lay
in
congress,
and
that
lease
talks
in
terms
of
appoint,
not
consist
of.
and
congress
did
nothing
to
change
that.
so
that's
an
additional
reason
why
you
should
try
to
interpret
the
statute
the
way
i
suggest.
finally,
our
forefathers
wanted
to
create
a
federal
government,
but
they
didn't
want
the
federal
government
to
be
at
war
with
the
state
government,
and
therefore
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
people
that
occupy
federal
office
could
also,
if
the
state
wanted,
occupy
state
office.
here
you
have
that
type
of
federalism,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
stretch
the
federal
separation
of
powers
doctrine
in
this
case,
where
the
chief
executive
of
the
federal
government
says
i'm
not
being
intruded
upon,
there
is
no
aggrandizement.
what
aggrandizement
can
there
be
when
all
congress
did
was
pass
a
statute
which
authorized
the
federal
officials
to
do
what
the
constitution
said
they
could
do,
namely
serve
in
state
office.
now,
certain
states
have
rejected
this.
i
think
new
hampshire,
for
example,
you
have
a
position,
provision,
justice
souter,
which
specifically
says
that
the
federal
official
cannot
occupy
the
state
office.
virginia
could
have
done
that.
it
didn't
do
that.
in
its
case
it
has
a
statute
which
says
that
the
federal
officer
can
occupy
the
state
officer.
and
i
repeat,
unless
you
find
that
the
congressional
person
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states,
which
i
think
under
the
statute
you
can't
find,
or
unless
you
find
that
what
they're
doing
is
exercising
federal
power,
then
i
think
here
you
have
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
thank
you.
