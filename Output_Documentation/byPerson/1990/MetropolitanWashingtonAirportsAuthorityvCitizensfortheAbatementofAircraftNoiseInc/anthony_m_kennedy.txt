justice
kennedy
but
of
course
there
was
no
question
in
that
case
that
they
were
exercising
federal
power.
we
didn't
have
to
reach
that
question.
here
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
congressmen,
because
they
are
appointed
as
congressmen,
are
not
exercising
federal
power.
suppose
on
this
board
five,
six
of
the
board
were
members
of
congress.
no
difference
to
your
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
as
a
practical
matter
a
congressman's
powers
during
the
time
he
is
in
office
as
a
congressman,
his
committee
assignments,
his
perks,
are
all
controlled
by
the
speaker.
and
it
seems
to
me
very,
very
clear
that
a
congressman
who
serves
on
the
board
can
have
his
actions
de
facto
reviewed
by
federal
authorities,
particularly
legislative
officials.
justice
kennedy
but,
mr.
coleman,
all
of
our
separation
of
powers
jurisprudence
looks
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
constraints
and
the
compulsions
and
the
authority
that
a
federal
agency
has
over
its
own
officials,
and
in
this
case
the
federal
entity
is
the
congress.
justice
kennedy
but
this
courts
sits
to
protect
the
executive
against
its
own
improvidence
from
time
to
time.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
so
is
the
federalism
problem
as
you
see
it
that
congress
has
had
a
hand
in
creating
the
very
position
to
which
they
are
directing
the
congressional
appointment?
justice
kennedy
so
do
you
say
that
this
board
is
really
created
by
federal
law?
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
if
there
were
a
1983
suit
against
members
of
the
board
that
it
would
be
an
appropriate
defense
that
they
are
federal
officers?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
you
can
concede
without
sacrificing
your
position
that
they're
both,
both
state
and
federal.
justice
kennedy
so
you
see
there
would
be
no
problem
if
congress
said
that
every
state
university
which
obtained
federal
funds
should
have
a
board
of
regents,
five,
six
of
whom
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
kennedy
what
would
be
the
problem?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
that
same
problem
present
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
assume
the
president
would
say
the,
and
the
congress
the
same
thing
with
expenditure
of
federal
funds
at
state
universities.
