mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
board
of
review
created
as
part
of
the
administrative
structure
under
which
washington
dulles
and
washington
national
airports
have
been
leased
by
the
federal
government
to
an
airports
authority
created
by
joint
action
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia.
the
problem
in
this
case,
and
it
is
a
novel
one,
arises
from
the
fact
that
congress
made
it
a
condition
of
the
lease
that
the
airports
authority
create
a
board
of
review,
that
this
board
of
review
have
veto
power
over
certain
significant
actions
of
the
airport
authority,
and
that
the
board
of
review
shall
consist
of
members
of
congress
to
be
selected
by
the
airports
authority
from
lists
to
be
furnished
by
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
pro
tem
of
the
senate.
the
problem
was
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
after
holding
that
the
controversy
was
justiciable,
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
essentially
two
determinations.
first,
that
the
board
of
review
was
exercising
federal
power
and
that
its
constitutionality
had
to
be
analyzed
on
that
basis;
and
second,
that
when
it
was
analyzed
on
that
basis,
its
existence,
its
authority,
and
its
composition
violated
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers.
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
both
scores.
first,
and
very
significant
to
the
analysis,
we
contend
that
it
was
wrong
in
concluding
that
for
purposes
of
separation
of
powers
analysis
the
board
of
review
was
exercising
federal
power.
the
authority
of
the
board
of
review
derived
from
the
joint
action
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
in
accordance
with
federal
conditions
that
were
laid
down
in
the
act.
secondly,
we
believe
that
the
conditions
laid
down
in
the
act,
although
they
do
raise
significant
separation
of
powers
questions
in
the
unusual
circumstances
of
this
case,
do
not
violate
that
basic
separation
of
powers
principle.
if
we
may
first
address
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
note
that
it
is
at
best
only
half-heartedly
defended
by
the
respondents.
we
think
that
choice
was
correct,
that
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale
was
wrong.
the
board
of
review
is
not
created
by
federal
law.
the
board
of
review
was
created
independently
by
the
joint
action
of
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
in
accordance
with
conditions
laid
down
by
federal
law.
but
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
were
not
coerced
into
creating
that
board
any
more
than
south
dakota
was
coerced
into
raising
the
drinking
age
to
21
as
a
condition
of
receiving
federal
funds.
indeed
we
believe
that
the
inducement,
which
admittedly
did
exist,
was
probably
a
good
deal
less
than
in
that
case
and
than
in
the
case
of
steward
machine
company
against
davis.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
believe
that
this
branch
of
the
analysis
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
it
only
poses
the
question.
that
is
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
board
itself
was
not
created
by
congress
leaves
a
difficult
constitutional
analysis--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--but
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
terms
of
this
court's
analysis
and
in
terms
of
practical
realities
it
was
an
offer
they
could
refuse.
that
is
it
was
not
the
kind
of
coercion
that
this
court
has
said
literally
destroys
the
independence
of
the
state
actor.
now,
as
i
said,
we
believe
that
that
simply
poses
the
constitutional
issue.
we
have
tried
to
explain
in
our
brief
that
the
constitutional
issue
that
is
posed
by
these
conditions
is
a
very
difficult
and
serious
one.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
there
are...
there
are
two
possible
conceptual
approaches
to
this,
your
honor.
one
is
the
one
you
just
suggested,
that
is
taken
i
think
perhaps
by
the
petitioner,
to
say
if
it's
done
by
the
states
and
if
they
weren't
coerced,
that's
the
end
of
it.
the
respondents
take
the
opposite
conceptual
approach
and
say
if
congress
has
attached
this
condition,
then
congress
is
asserting
itself
in
a
way
in
which
it
is
not
allowed
to
by
the
constitution.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
the
federal
power
takes
the
form
of
a
condition.
we
see
the
question
as
being
the
question
whether
the
federal
power
in
the
form
of
a
condition
is
an
unconstitutional
condition
because
of
its
implications
for
the
separation
of
powers.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
by
congress,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
was
saying
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
board
of
review
is
exercising
federal
power
in
the
actions
that
it
takes,
that
the
board
of
review
effectively
is
a
federal
agency
and
has
to
be
analyzed
as
such.
if
that
were
true,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
it
would
violate
both
the
incompatibility--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that's
correct.
and
the
granting
of
the
lease
by
the
department
of--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
it
did.
yes,
it
did.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
what
is
left
is
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
raises
about
whether
or
not
congress
may
properly
use
conditions
like
this
attached
to
federal
statutes
as
a
way
of
effectively
usurping
executive
authority.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
we...
well,
what
we
are
concerned
about...
first
of
all
we
believe
that
in
this
case
what
exercise
of
federal
power
there
was
did
not
violate
the
constitution.
but
change
the
case,
for
example,
to
a
case
in
which
congress
had
reserved
the
authority
to
appoint
members
of
the
board.
then
of
course
there
would
be
the
additional
exercise
of
federal
power
involved
in
the
appointment,
or
congress
had
reserved
the
authority
to
remove
members
of
the
board.
now,
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
i
think
is
adopted
by
the
respondents,
is
that
there
is
in
this
case
additional
exercise
of
federal
power
in
the
form
of
a
kind
of
de
facto
appointment
and
removal
power
existing
in
congress.
for
example,
it
is
suggested
that,
by
removing
members
of
the
board
of
review
from
relevant
congressional
committees,
congress
can
effectively
remove
them
from
their
position
of
authority
in
state
office.
so
that
would
be
an
additional
exercise
of
federal
power.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no.
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
we
do,
in
addition,
have
a
separation
of
powers
problem.
we
think
that
problem
is
answered
in
the
context
of
this
case.
we
don't
think
it
can
be
answered
in
all
of
the
hypotheticals
that
justice
o'connor
raises
in
her
question,
because
we
think
that
if
congress
were
to
use
this
condition
device
as
a
way
of
putting
members
of
congress
into
essentially
executive
roles
in
the
playing
out
of
federal
programs
at
the
state
level,
that
that
would
be
a
usurpation
of
executive
authority
and
interference
with
the
executive
role.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
requirement
that
the
members
of
the
board
of
review
be
both
members
of
congress
and
in
most
cases
members
of
certain
relevant
committees
do
constitute
solely
qualifications
for
appointment.
we
think
that
is
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
statute,
that
subsection
1
refers
to
appointment
of
2456(f).
subsection
2
refers
to
fixed
terms
of
office,
which
in
our
view
do
not
require
that,
once
appointed,
those
members
of
the
board
either
continue
to
be
members
of
congress
or
continue
to
be
members
of
the
relevant
committees.
incidentally,
the
only
time,
as
i
understand
it,
that
that
has
come
up,
when
senator
kassebaum
did
cease
to
be
a
member
of
the
relevant
committee,
she
did
resign
from
the
board.
but
our
view
under
the
statute
is
that
that's
not
required.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i...
i
don't
know
whether
the
language
of
that
is
identical
to
the
language
here.
i
think
the
language
here
is
clear--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--we
don't
think
with
respect
to
removal
that
it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
we
don't
think
congress
has
either
de
jure
or
de
facto
removal
power.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
oh.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
a
related
question
which
we
think
is
relevant
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
that
is
are
the
members
of
congress
who
serve
on
the
board
of
review
themselves
exercising
congressional
power?
are
they
agents
of
congress
in
trying
to
resolve
this
difficult
separation
of
powers
issue.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
our
answer
to
that
is
that
in
the
unusual
circumstances
of
this
case
we
don't
think
the
members
of
the
board
of
review
themselves
are
exercising
congressional
power
or
acting
as
agents
of
congress.
and
that's
because
both
in
form
and
in
substance
we
believe
that
the
members
of
congress
are
serving
as
individual
representatives
of
users.
the
statute
specifically
says
they
are
to
serve
in
their
individual
capacities
as
representatives
of
the
users
of
the
airport.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
both.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there
is
no
question
that
the
parking
spaces
were
a
matter
of
some
interest.
the
legislative
history
confirms
that.
[laughter]
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
but
they
also
have
interests
that
are
shared
more
broadly
by
all
users,
and
indeed
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
they
are
concerned
with
their
need
to
use
the
airport
as
individuals.
and
it's
also
true
that
that
is
a
need
that
is...
excuse
me,
your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
