justice
scalia
why
does
it
just
pose
it,
mr.
shapiro?
if
you
say
that
there
is
no
federal
power
being
exercised
here,
isn't
that
an
end
of
the
separation
of
powers
problem?
justice
scalia
well,
but
there...
which
is
to
say
that
there
is
federal
power
being
exercised.
but
you
are
contending
that
there
is
no
federal
power
being
exercised.
and
if
there
is
no
federal
power
being
exercised,
that's
the
end
of
the
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
so
you
say
there
is
federal
power
being
exercised
in
the
form
of
a
condition.
justice
scalia
oh.
well,
i
thought
you
were
saying
there
was
no
federal
power
being
exercised.
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean,
nobody
contests
that
the
statute
that
congress
passed
is
an
exercise
of
federal
power.
is
that
all
you're
saying?
that's
the
only
federal
power,
the
statute?
justice
scalia
well,
congress
certainly
had
the
power
to
pass
the
statute.
justice
scalia
well,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
the
federal
power
involved...
the
only
federal
power
involved,
you
tell
us,
was
the
statute.
congress
certainly
had
authority
to
pass
that.
there
is
no
federal
power
involved
in
the
exercise
by
the
board.
what
is
left?
justice
scalia
but
it's
not...
that
would
be
a
valid
argument
if
they
were
using
the
condition
in
order,
unconstitutionally,
to
exercise
federal
power.
but
you're
telling
me
that
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
there
is
no
unconstitutional
exercise
of
federal
power.
so
therefore
it
can't
be
an
unconstitutional
condition
because
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
about
it.
congress
passed
a
statute,
which
it
can
do,
and
this
board
is
not
exercising
federal
power.
where
is
the
unconstitutionality?
justice
scalia
just
to
finish
up
your
response
to
justice
o'connor,
do
i
understand
that
the
government's
only
problem,
the
executive
branch's
only
problem
with
this
statute
is
a
federalism
problem,
not
a
separation
of
powers
problem?
it's
just
the
unconstitutional
condition
because
it
impinges
on
the
states.
is
that
the
only
problem
the
executive
branch
has
with
this?
justice
scalia
i
suppose
if
you
interpreted
the
constitution
that
way,
a
senator
who
has
to
be
a
citizen
to
be
elected,
should
he
abandon
his
american
citizenship
during
his
6-year
term,
could
continue
to
serve,
because
it's
only
a
qualification
for
taking
the
office
and
not
for
continuing
in
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
coleman,
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
phrase
that
these
people
shall
act
in
their
personal
capacity
cleanses
it
all.
i
think
you
would
maintain
that
even
if
it
were
provided
that
this
board
would
consist
of
both
houses
of
congress,
the
members
of
both
houses
of
congress
acting
in
their
personal
capacity,
it
would
still
be
okay,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
it
would
make
it
a
different
case.
it
wouldn't
be
harder
for
you,
because
they
would
still
be
acting
in
their
personal
capacity.
justice
scalia
no--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
coleman,
in
your
research
of,
among
the
doings
of
the
founders,
that
it
is
clear
that
people
could
hold
both
federal
and
state
office,
but
is
there
anyone
who
said
that
you
could
hold
state
office
or
be
nominated
to
state
office
by
virtue
of
your
federal
office?
that
is
ex
officio
that
a
state
can
provide
the
speaker
of
the
house
shall
be
our
governor,
or
the
speaker
of
the
house
shall
be
our--
justice
scalia
--i
know
it
isn't,
but
this
is
a
case
where
it
is
not
just
federal
officials
who
happen
to
run
for
state
office
or
get
appointed
separately
for,
independently
of
their
being
federal
officials.
they
acquire
this
state
office
only
ex
officio,
only
because
they
are
federal
officials.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
sayings
of
the
founders
about
that?
justice
scalia
well,
you're
not
blaming
me
for
that,
mr.
coleman.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
of
course
if
congress
wanted
to
renew
the
lease,
if
congress
was
content
with
the
parking
spaces
it
got
but
the
executive
was
not
content
because
the
executive
had
not
gotten
parking
spaces,
the
president
could
veto
the
lease
renewal
in
that
situation,
couldn't
he?
i
mean,
it
would
be
the
normal
process
of
legislation
by
which
congress
would
have
to
act,
rather
than--
justice
scalia
--it's
quite
a
different
process
than
just
having
some
individual
members
of
congress
or
a
committee
of
congress
decide
to
do
it
or
not.
justice
scalia
you
say
assigned
it
to
nine
of
their
members,
but
it
does
provide
that
the
members
are
to
act
in
their
individual
capacity.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
chief
justice
being
on
the
board
of
the
smithsonian,
being
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
smithsonian,
which
goes
back
quite
a
ways?
justice
scalia
they're
artistic
powers,
is
that--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
as
you
quoted
in
your
brief,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
congress
would
have
to
pay
for
it,
as
you
had
an
excerpt
from
some
of
the
debate
in
which
a
congressman
said
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
we
control
it
but
we
don't
have
to
pay
for
it.
