ms.
patti
a.
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
dispute
that
members
of
congress
could
not
exercise
the
powers
that
are
assigned
to
the
board
of
review
if
the
federal
government
still
ran
the
airports.
there
is
also
no
dispute
that
congress
could
have
required
the
airports
authority
to
submit
its
actions
to
congress
for
a
specified
period
of
time,
or
ever
for
approval
in
the
form
of
a
statute.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
can
make
its
delegation
of
authority
over
the
airports
subject
to
a
condition
that
requires
nine
members
of
congress
to
exercise
significant
ongoing
authority
over
those
airports.
four
factors
of
the
board
of
review
arrangement
bear
directly
on
this
issue.
first,
the
board
of
review
arose
out
of
a
federal
condition
that
is
contained
in
a
federal
statute
and
a
lease
of
federal
property.
second,
that
condition
requires
nine
members
of
congress
to
comprise
the
board
of
review.
they
must
all
be
recommended
by
the
congressional
leadership,
and
eight
of
them
must
serve
on
the
congressional
committees
that
have
oversight
responsibilities
over
the
airport.
the
third
factor
is
the
powers
exercised
by
the
board
of
review.
there
is
no
question
that
the
types
of
powers
that
the
board
exercises
are
executive
in
nature.
and
the
fourth
factor
is
the
nonseverability
clause,
or
what
we
have
called
the
drop-dead
clause.
congress
has
decided
in
the
statute
that
if
the
board
of
review
cannot
exercise
its
powers,
neither
can
the
airports
authority.
and
the
significance
of
this
factor
is
that
congress
made
that
decision,
not
the
district
and
not
virginia,
and
also
that
congress
believed
that
the
power
its
members
would
exercise
was
an
essential
element
of
the
transfer.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
there
would
be
not...
no
official
ongoing
role
that
members
of
congress
play.
of
course
congress
still
has
the
power,
the
retained
congressional
power
to
pass
statutes
and
to
decide
whether
the
lease
could
go
forward,
but
that's
the
kind
of
power
congress
can
exercise.
its
mingling
in
the
affairs
may
be
improper,
but
it
probably
would
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
separation
of
powers
violation.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
assuming
that
statute
was
required,
then
the
president
would
have
that
power.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
it's
a
very
different
process,
and
that's
precisely
what's
wrong
with
this
arrangement.
members
of
congress
are
carrying
out
day-to-day
operational
responsibilities
over
these
airports.
it's
important
to
recognize
too
that
congress
did
not
give
up
the
airports,
and
that
it
independently
obtained
this
power.
it
refused
to
give
up
the
powers
that
are
exercised
by
the
board
of
review.
in
essence
this
is
an
incomplete
delegation
of
power.
congress
gave
up
a
large
measure
of
the
power,
but
not
the
power
over
the
master
plan
and
the
budget
and
regulations.
these
powers
it
kept
for
the
federal
government,
and
it
assigned
these
powers
to
nine
of
its
own
members.
as
retained
federal
powers,
these
powers
cannot
be
exercised
by
congress
in
this
way.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
it
does,
but
that
label
does
not
change
the
fact
that
the
board
must
consist
of
nine
members,
that
they
must
be
recommended
by
the
congressional
leadership.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
we
certainly
don't
want
to
be
accused
of
laying
a
hand
on
the
arc
of
the
covenant,
as
justice
holmes
said,
and
fortunately
i
don't
think
we
have
to
in
this
case.
i
think
the
powers
that
are
exercised
by
the
smithsonian
may
be
different
in
nature.
they
may
not
rise
to
the
level
of
significant
authority--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--i'm
not
familiar
with
the
day-to-day
functions
that
the
board
would
exercise,
but
it
may
be
that
those
powers
are
not
as
significant
to
be
a
federal
office
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
so
members
of
congress
may
be
able
to
exercise
those
functions.
here,
though,
the
functions
are
clearly
executive.
members
of
congress
could
not
exercise
these
functions
in
the
federal
scheme,
and
members
of
congress
could
not
in
their
individual
capacity
exercise
a
veto
of
the
sort
that
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
chadha.
that
individual
label
would
not
save
that
arrangement.
if
congress
is
going
to
exercise
this
type
of
power
it
must
do
so
through
the
bicameralism
and
presentment
clauses.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
i
believe
that
their
appointment
and
service
is
inextricably
tied
to
their
role
as
a
member
of
congress.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
well,
in
the
federal
scheme
members
of
congress
only
have
one
identity,
and
that
is
their
official
role.
because
of
the
incompatibility
clause,
members
cannot
take
off
their
congressional
hat
and
become
individuals
serving
in
some
federal
kind
of
position.
in
the
situation
of
the
smithsonian
their
service
is
tied
with
the
term
of
office,
as
we
believe
it
is
here
as
well.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
if
members
of
congress
are
appointed
to
a
state
office,
they
are
not
serving
as
members
of
congress
but
are
clearly
serving
in
an
individual
capacity.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
it
is
both
the
qualification,
the
requirement
that
they
be
members
of
congress,
and
also
that
that
requirement
came
at
least
in
part
from
congress.
so
that
in
this
situation
we
have
congressional
aggrandizement,
where
congress,
by
passing
a
statute
that
establishes
this
condition,
has
required
that
its
own
members
get
power
over
federal
property.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
it
may
not
because
the
powers
they
exercise
may
not
be
as
significant
of
a
type
of
executive
power--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--it
may
be
then
a
power
that
they
cannot
exercise.
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
that
arrangement.
that's
obviously
not
before
the
court.
and
in
springer
that
was
discussed
in
the
context
of
the
powers
exercised
by
the
legislature
in
the
philippine
islands,
and
it
did
not
keep
the
majority
from
striking
down
that
arrangement.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
yes,
we
do.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
the
board
of
review
shall
consist
of
the
nine
members
of
congress,
eight
of
whom
must
serve
on
the
oversight
committees.
it
does
not
say
that
the
board
shall
consider
these
people
for
appointment
or
shall
appoint
them.
it
says
the
board
shall
consist
of
these
individuals.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
it
is
not.
in
this
case
the
clear
indication
is
that
the
board
of
review
has
the
power
over
the
airports
authority.
that
is
the
critical
feature.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
no,
i
am
not.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
if
its
functions
are
advisory,
it
would
certainly
not
be
invalid.
if
it
has
some
operational
functions
it
may
not
carry
out
significant
powers
to
be
an
agency
or
to
rise
to
the
level
of
an
office
of
the
united
states.
so
the
answer
to
that
question
would
depend
on
the
precise
powers
that
are
carried
out.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
which
i
don't
know.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
certainly
the
service
of
judges
would
not
be
prohibited
under
a
decision
in
this
case
striking
down
the
board
of
review,
since
there
is
no
incompatibility
clause
for
judges
and
there
would
be
no
aggrandizement
if
congress
required
by
statute
that
judges
serve
in
this
type
of
arrangement.
but
the
service
of
members
of
congress
is
a
different
story
because
of
the
aggrandizement
factor
and
the
incompatibility
clause.
if
this
arrangement
is
upheld,
the
board
of
review
would
provide
a
road
map
for
congress
to
follow
whenever
it
wanted
to
acquire
a
day-to-day
power
over
the
operation
of
federal
property
or
federal
funds.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
true.
they
would
have
to
exercise
that
power
through
a
consent
to
a
compact
or
statute.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
yes,
it
would
be,
because
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
is
not
designed
simply
to
protect
the
executive
branch,
in
fact
its
primary
purpose
is
to
protect
the
people
against
arbitrary
exercises
of
power.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
in
this
case
the
respondents
are
individuals
and
organizations
that
represent
individuals
who
are
affected
on
a
daily
basis
by
the
operations
at
national
airport.
they
are
interested
in
the
noise,
the
traffic
congestion
and
pollution--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--it's
not
about
protecting
the
executive.
it's
about
protecting--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--it
might
do
more
than
that
by
requiring
that
the
airports
authority
take
its
actions
through
a
democratic
process
as
required
by
the
constitution.
and
those
processes
are
designed
to
protect
the
people
from
laws
that
create
too
much
power
to
one
branch
of
government.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
it
could
do
that.
it
may
have
certain
interests
in
mind
that
may
be
adverse
to
other
users
or
to
the
people
in
the
area.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
exactly.
and
that
same
person
said
that
congress
would
be
eating...
getting
its
cake
and
eating
it
too.
and
that's
the
problem
with
this
arrangement
is
congress
can't
do
both.
it
can't
give
up
the
power
and
retain
the
core
power
at
the
same
time.
it
has
to
do
one
or
the
other.
the
delegation
of
the
power
did
have
the
benefits
of
ensuring
some
degree
of
local
control
and
the
ability
to
raise
money
through
bonds,
and
to
remove
the
airports
from
a
line
item
in
the
federal
budget.
it
can,
the
congress
cannot
get
rid
of
that
responsibility
but
keep
the
decision
making
power
over
regulations
and
master
plans,
the
chief
executive
order
and
the
other
powers
that
are
given
to
the
board
of
review.
if
this
arrangement
is
upheld,
congress
will
be
able
to
inject
itself
into
decisions
about
how
the
national
parks
are
operated,
perhaps
grants
given
by
the
national
endowment
of
the
arts,
postal
operations,
legal
services
programs.
and
the
way
it
would
do
this
is
by
delegating
those
programs
in
part
to
the
states
or
private
entity,
but
requiring
the
states
or
the
private
entity
to
subject
their
decisions
to
review
by
an
ad
hoc
committee
of
congress,
or
even
one
house
of
congress,
and
then
congress
would
be
able
to
influence
and
have
a
mandatory
say
over
how
these
programs
are
run.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
yes.
that
is
what
creates
the
congressional
aggrandizement
here,
which
is
the
primary
flaw
in
this
arrangement.
congress
retains--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--it
is
mandated
by
a
condition.
if
the
state
of,
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
wanted
these
airports,
they
had
no
choice
but
to
have
a
board
of
review.
it
was
their
statutes
that
created
the
airports
authority,
but
it
was
the
federal
statute
that
set
out
the
powers
and
composition
requirements
for
the
board
of
review.
so
congress
had
some
say
and
had
some
power
that
it
exercised
here,
and
it
used
that
power
to
give
its
own
members
a
veto.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
in
this
situation,
because
congress
retains
significant
federal
powers,
i
think
they
are
federal
officers.
however,
there
could
be
other
federal
conditions
that
would
not
create
federal
offices.
and
even
if
this
is
not
viewed
to
be
a
federal
office
it
would
be
impermissible,
because
it
is
giving
members
of
congress
powers
over
federal
property
that
it
cannot
have.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
i
know
no
precedent
for
that,
but
i
assume
they
have
aspects
of
both.
even
if
the
power
that
is
actually
exercised
is
viewed
to
be
state
power,
members
of
congress
could
not
serve
in
those
positions
under
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
there
is
enough
of
a
federal
role
through
the
federal
condition
to
call
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
into
play,
and
that
doctrine
prohibits
members
of
congress
from
exercising
these
types
of
powers
over
a
significant
federal
interest.
and
here--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--this
case
concerns
the
federal
separation
of
powers.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
i
don't
think
we
are,
because
in
the
kind
of
condition
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
there
was
a
question
of
who
had
the
power.
congress
didn't
have
the
power
to
legislate
and
the
states
did.
and
i
think
the
rationale
is
that
when
the
states
exercise
their
power,
their
political
process
cleanses
the
federal
role.
but
when
you're
talking
about
individual
rights
under
the
federal
constitution,
or
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers,
which
in
the
end
protects
the
people,
the
state
isn't
interested
in
protecting
those
interests.
and
that...
the
state
process
doesn't
remove
the
federal
role,
the
federal
mandate
that
the
separation
of
powers
be
violated.
because
of
that,
a
condition
is
not
the
right
way
to
accomplish
this
result.
it
doesn't
erase
the
problems
that
are
presented
by
members
of
congress
serving
in
this
role.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
i
think
there
would
be
a
problem
in
that
situation.
that's
a
federalism
problem--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--that
the
federal
government
is
usurping
state
power
in
that
instance.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
here
there
is
a
stronger
federal
interest
at
the
outset
because
of
the
presence
of
federal
property
in
this
arrangement.
so
the
power
was
the
federal
government's
power
to
delegate.
and
when
it
delegated
these
powers
it
attached
conditions
which
kept--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--if
congress
set
up
a
review
board
that
had
power
over
the
federal
monies,
the
connection
to
the
federal
interest
may
be
strong
enough
for
the
federal
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
to
be
called
into
play.
but
where
the
power
is
the
power
to
run
a
state
university,
which
is
state
power
at
the
outset
and
does
not
change
by
the
federal
condition,
the
federal
appointment
of
individuals
would
probably
usurp
state
power.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
i
don't
think
they
necessarily
do,
because
congress
can
pass
a
statute
setting
out
the
conditions
that
are
attached
to
the
use
of
federal
money.
if
its
role
ends
there--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--that
is
the...
precisely
the
difference.
if
congress--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--if
congress
sets
up
an
ongoing
role
over
the
federal
funds
or
the
federal
property,
then
it
is
going
too
far,
and
that
is
federal
power
that
cannot
go
to
members
of
congress.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
as
soon
as
there
is
an
on-going
role
by
the
federal
government
it
is
a
federal
separation
of
powers
issue.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
no.
there's
no
federalism
issue--
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
--that
comes
up
in
that
context.
there
could
be
other
federalism
issues,
but
the
one
we're
focusing
on
here
is
the
purely
separation
of
powers
one
when
there
is
an
ongoing
federal
role.
ms.
patti
a.
goldman
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
