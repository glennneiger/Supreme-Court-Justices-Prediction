justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
are
they
representatives
of
all
users
or
of
users
who
have
free
parking
spaces?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
you
think
they
are
typical
users?
justice
stevens
but
not
to
other
users.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
in
the
legislative
veto
cases
the
executive
from
time
to
time
has
taken
the
position
that
veto
was
all
right,
i
think,
had
he
not?
justice
stevens
in
the
one
that
was
argued
here.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
it
just
shows
the
executive's
views
on
these
issues
can
change
in
different
administrations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
raises
a
constitutional
question
concerning
the
separation
of
powers
among
the
three
branches
of
the
federal
government.
two
of
the
three
commercial
airports
serving
the
washington
and
metropolitan
area,
washington
national
and
dallas
international,
have
been
owned
by
the
federal
government
since
they
opened.
in
1987,
congress
passed
a
statute
authorizing
the
transfer
of
operating
control
of
both
of
those
airports
from
the
federal
government
to
an
agency
created
jointly
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia.
the
agency
is
known
as
the
metropolitan
washington
airports
authority,
it
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
congress
conditioned
the
transfer
of
control
of
the
airports
on
the
creation
by
that
authority
of
a
unique
board
of
review
composed
of
nine
members
of
congress
invested
with
veto
power
over
managerial
decisions
made
by
the
authority's
board
of
directors.
the
principal
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
unusual
statutory
condition
is
constitutional.
respondents
represent
local
residence
concerned
about
safety,
noise,
and
pollution
caused
by
the
high
level
of
air
traffic
at
national
airport.
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
board's
veto
power,
after
the
board
declined
to
veto
the
airport
authority's
master
plan
which
respondents
alleged
would
increase
noise
and
congestion
at
national.
respondents
argued
that
the
board
was
an
agent
of
congress
and
was
either
improperly
exercising
executive
power
or
exercising
legislative
power
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
the
constitution.
the
district
court
rejected
respondent's
arguments,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed.
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
we
agree
with
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
respondents
have
standing
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
board
of
review
and
we
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
board's
veto
power
violates
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
the
board
was
created
at
the
initiative
of
congress.
its
powers
were
delineated
by
congress.
its
purpose
is
to
protect
the
acknowledged
federal
interest
in
efficient
and
extensive
service
at
washington
airports
and
most
important
the
membership
of
the
board
consists
entirely
of
members
of
congress.
the
board,
therefore,
exercises
sufficient
federal
power
as
an
agent
of
congress
that
it
is
required
to
exercise
that
power
in
compliance
with
the
constitutional
stretchers
of
the
separation
of
powers.
if
the
powers
of
the
board
are
considered
executive
in
character,
they
may
not
be
exercised
by
an
agent
of
congress.
on
the
other
hand,
if
those
powers
are
characterized
as
legislative,
they
must
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
set
forth
in
article
1
of
the
constitution.
if
this
unusual
and
unprecedented
statutory
scheme
were
upheld,
it
would
provide
a
blue
print
for
a
major
expansion
of
congressional
power.
given
the
scope
of
federal
power
to
dispense
benefits
to
the
states
subject
to
a
host
of
statutory
conditions,
congress
could,
if
the
board
of
review
were
valid,
use
similar
expedience
to
retain
control
outside
the
legislative
process
of
the
activities
of
state
grant
recipients
charged
with
executing
virtually
every
aspect
of
national
policy.
it
is
precisely
this
sort
of
aggrandizement
of
the
powers
of
one
branch
of
the
government
that
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
was
designed
to
prevent.
the
statutory
condition
creating
the
board
of
review,
therefore,
cannot
stand.
justice
white
had
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
marshall
have
joined.
