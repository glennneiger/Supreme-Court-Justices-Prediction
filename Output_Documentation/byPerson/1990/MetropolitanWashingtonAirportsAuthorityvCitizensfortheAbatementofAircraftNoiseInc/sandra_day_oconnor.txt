justice
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
by
the
same
logic
i
suppose
you
would
be...
you're
defending
an
effort
by
congress
to
structure
some
kind
of
board
of
review
with
effective
veto
power,
as
this
board
has,
over,
for
instance,
the
federal
funding
of
aid
to
the
states
for
transportation
or
health
services
or
welfare
benefits,
or
anything
else
that
the
federal
government
provides
money
for.
i
mean,
that
would
be
your
theory,
and
it
would
be
a
means
by
which
the
congress
could
in
effect
have
a
veto
exercised
by
members
of
its
appropriate
committees.
justice
o'connor
well,
congress
certainly
had
a
gun
pointed
at
the
heads
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia,
which
wanted
to
establish
an
airport
authority,
and
congress
said
fine,
you
can
do
it
but
you're
going
to
give
us
the
veto
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
coleman,
isn't
the
reality,
though,
that
the
members
of
the
board
are
required
to
be
members
of
congress,
or
at
least
a
certain
number
of
them,
and
they
have
to
be
members
of
a
certain
committee
of
congress?
and
it's
arguable
that
when
they
cease
to
be
they
must
be
removed.
now,
if
that
is
the
case,
is
there
not
an
exercise
of
federal
power
on
a
continuing
basis?
justice
o'connor
um-hum.
justice
o'connor
and
why
isn't
the
same...
why
doesn't
the
same
problem
exist
for
the
congressional
members
of
the
smithsonian?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
power
is
the
power
of
a
board?
justice
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
member
of
the
board
of
review
loses
the
membership
if
the
member
ceases
to
be
a
member
of
the
appropriate
congressional
committee?
justice
o'connor
is
the
removal
point
essential
to
your
argument?
