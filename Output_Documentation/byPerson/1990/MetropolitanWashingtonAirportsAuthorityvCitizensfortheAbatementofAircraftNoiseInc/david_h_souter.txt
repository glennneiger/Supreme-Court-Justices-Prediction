justice
souter
but
mr.
shapiro,
even
on
that
assumption,
does
that
really
answer
the
issue
that
justice
o'connor
raised?
and
that
is,
let's
assume
there
may
be
incidents
in
which
individuals
may
continue
to
serve
though
they
don't
remain
members
of
congress
or
of
the
committees.
there's
still
a
problem
to
be
answered,
and
that
is
that,
as
you
put
it,
there
is
a,
appears
to
be
a
de
facto
exercise
of
federal
power
over...
in
this
case
over
the
actions
of
a
non-federal
board
of
directors.
congress
is
still
de
facto
being
allowed
to
exercise
power,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
no,
but
with
respect
to
the
authority
that
they
exercise
in
their
approval
or
disapproval
power
over
the
actions
of
the
board.
justice
souter
and
i
took
it
that
was
one
of
the
concerns
in
her
question--
justice
souter
--as
to
whether
a
similar
structure
could
be
erected--
justice
souter
--in
relation
to
welfare
money
to
the
states,
highway
money
to
the
states,
and
so
on.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
souter
so
you
would
have
no
issue
to
raise
by
the
mere
fact
that
some
members
of
congress
happen
to
end
up
on
this
board
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
membership
on
the
board...
that
membership
in
congress
is
a
qualification
for
membership
on
the
board?
i
mean,
that's
really
the
essence
of
your
point.
you're
saying
if
that
were
not
so,
then
it,
it
would
in
fact
make
sense
in
the
normal
course
to
say
that
they
were
acting
in
their
individual
capacities.
justice
souter
and
their
congressional
membership
is
merely
incidental.
and
you're
saying
the
fact
of
the
qualification
is
what
removes
it
from
the
category
of
what
is
merely
incidental.
justice
souter
but
isn't
the
justification
in
each
case
the
fact
that
there
is
federal
property
in
the
form
of
federal
money
going,
and
that
these
are
conditions
placed
upon
the
federal
money.
don't
they
ultimately
all
stand
on
the
same
footing?
justice
souter
isn't
the
difference
that
the...
we're
not
talking
about
a
condition
set
once
and
for
all
by
congress
which
is
binding
because
it
is...
it
has
statutory
significance.
it's
setting
up
a
condition
which
imposes
a
continuing
review
by
federal
officials.
justice
souter
don't
we
have
that
in
both
the
state
university
example
and
the
highway
funds
example?
justice
souter
okay.
and
all
you're
saying
is
you
don't
really
have
to
think
of
that
as
a
federalism
problem.
it's
a
straight
separation
problem.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
okay.
and
you
don't
have
to
put
a
federalism
overlay
on
it.
that's
really
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
okay.
