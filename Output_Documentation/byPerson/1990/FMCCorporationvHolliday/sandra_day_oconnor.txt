justice
o'connor
well,
the
deemer
clause
uses
the
word
regulate.
it
applies...
you're
not...
an
employee
benefit
plan
shall
not
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company
for
purposes
of
any
state
law
purporting
to
regulate
insurance
companies.
now,
does
that
term
need
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioner,
fmc
corporation,
self-funded
healthcare
plans,
paid
a
portion
of
the
respondents
medical
expenses
resulting
from
an
automobile
accident.
fmc
then
informed
respondent
that
it
would
seek
reimbursement
under
the
plans
subrogation
provision
from
any
recovery
she
realized
in
her
pennsylvania
negligence
action
against
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
in
which
she
was
injured.
the
respondent
subsequently
sought
and
obtained
a
declaratory
judgment
in
federal
district
court
that
section
1720
of
pennsylvanias
motor
vehicle
financial
responsibility
law,
which
precludes
reimbursement
from
a
claimants
tort
recovery
or
benefit
payments
by
a
program,
group,
contractor,
or
other
arrangements,
prohibits
fmcs
exercise
of
subrogation
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
the
employment
retirement
income
security
act,
erisa
which
applies
to
employee
welfare
benefit
plan
such
as
fmcs,
does
not
preempt
the
state
statute.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
examine
the
scope
of
section
514b2b
of
erisa
otherwise
known
as
the
deemer
clause.
the
deemer
clause
sates
that
an
employee
benefit
plan
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company
or
other
insurer
or
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
for
purposes
of
any
state
law
reporting
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
we
hold
that
this
deemer
clause
excludes
self-funded
erisa
plans,
such
as
fmcs
plan,
from
the
reach
of
state
laws
that
regulate
insurance.
thus,
pennsylvanias
section
1720
is
preempted.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
accordingly
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
