justice
stevens
mr.
turner,
let
me...
may
i
ask
you
two
questions.
these
cases
get
us
awfully
confused,
but
is
this
much
perfectly
clear.
that
if
your
client
had
been
an
insured
plan,
there
would
be...
there
would
be
no
preemption
because
it
comes
within
the
second
clause,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
if
that
is
true...
i
guess
i
have
trouble...
what
sense
does
it
make...
why
is
your
client
being
treated
differently?
what
is
congress
trying
to
do
here?
justice
stevens
--by
saying
that
these
entities
should
not
become
subject
to
state
insurance
regulation
because
they
would
be
considered
insurance
companies.
justice
stevens
it's
very
interesting.
i
think
it's
the
brief
of
the
state
legislature
or
one
of
the
state
organizations,
recites
precisely
the
same
history
and
comes
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
justice
stevens
how
do
you
deal
with
the
other
argument
that's
kind
of
related
to
this
that
the
second
clause...
i
get
the
names
mixed
up...
uses
the
word
person.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
insurance
company,
whereas
the
deemer
clause
says
you
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company.
but
it
really
doesn't
take
a
noninsured
plan
out
of
the
term
person
and--
justice
stevens
--shall
not
relieve
any
person
from
any
law
which
regulates
insurance,
banking,
or
securities.
and
we
have
a
law
which
i
guess
everybody
agrees
does
regulate
insurance,
bankings,
and
securities.
and
apart
from
the
preemption
provision,
your
client
would
be
a
person
subject
to
that
law.
justice
stevens
it
would,
sir,
if
the
status
is
being
subject
to
state
regulation
depended
on
your
being
an
insurance
company,
status
as
that
kind
of
person,
then
you
don't
become
that
kind
of
person
just
because
you're
an
erisa
fund.
justice
stevens
what
is
carver...
it
cannot
be
called
an
insurance
company
by
reason
of
the
deemer
clause.
but
the
question
i
have
is
whether
one
has
to
be...
a
person
has
to
be
an
insurance
company
to
be
a
person
who
is
obligated
to
obey
state
laws
regulating
insurance,
banking,
or
securities.
that's
the
question
that
runs
through
my
mind.
justice
stevens
well,
my
point
is
that
the...
your
client
is
a
person,
whether
or
not
it
is
an
insurance
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
deemer
clause,
and
maybe
that's
enough
to
answer
the
case.
justice
stevens
counsel,
may
i
just
ask...
we've
received
amicus
briefs
from
people
on
the
health
care
professions
cautioning
that
our
decision
in
this
case
might
affect
freedom
of
choice,
chiropractors,
et
cetera.
is...
will
that
necessarily
be
the
case
if
we
follow
your
interpretation?
justice
stevens
so,
you
were
thinking
that
there
would
be
preemption
because
it
relates
to
insurance?
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
you
omitted
two
important
words
when
you
quoted
the
statutes:
"purporting
to
regulate"
which
suggest
to
me
that
statutes
which
in
terms
define
the
regulated
entities
as
insurance
companies,
insurance
contracts,
banks,
and
so
forth.
and
what
they're
saying
is
if
that's
the
manner
of
bringing
the
person
under
state
regulation,
it
just
doesn't
apply
to
erisa
fund.
does
that
stop
an
erisa
fund
from
being
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
second
clause?
justice
stevens
then
the
word
purporting
is
redundant,
is
totally
unnecessary?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
it
adds
any
meaning?
justice
stevens
the
point
that
there
is
no
regulatory
gap,
because
this
court
is
a
power
to
fill
the
gap.
is
that
the
argument?
justice
stevens
it's
common
law
that
fills
the
gap.
justice
stevens
mr.
rothfeld,
you
use
the
term
the
deemer
clause
preempting.
i
don't
understand
under
your
analysis,
the
deemer
clause
preempts
anything.
just
that
the
insurance
savings
clause
excludes
a
lot
of
regulations
from
preemption.
but
the
deemer
clause
just
saves
a
lot
of
self-insured
entities
from
becoming
state-regulated
insurance
companies.
justice
stevens
which
is
not...
that
doesn't
preempt
anything.
justice
stevens
it's
not
clear
that
statute
would
apply
to
this
contract
either,
is
it?
justice
stevens
it's
not
clear
that
his
hypothetical
statute
would
even
apply
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
that
if
we
adopt
the
solicitor
general's
position,
we'll
have
to
take
more
erisa
cases
than
if
we
don't?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
that
might
be
easier
than
trying
to
figure
out
this
statute.
[laughter]
mr.
rothfeld,
what
about
the
exception
in
the
deemer
clause
for
a
plan
established
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
providing
death
benefits?
how
does
that
exception
make
sense
under
your
interpretation
and
under
the
government's
interpretation?
justice
stevens
anybody's?
