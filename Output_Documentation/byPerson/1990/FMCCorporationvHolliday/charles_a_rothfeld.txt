mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
that
mr.
turner
and
mr.
shapiro
have
been
describing
today
i
think
very
simply
is
not
the
statute
that
congress
wrote.
they
read
the
deemer
clause
as
though
it
said,
notwithstanding
savings
clause,
all
state
laws
that
regulate
insurance
are
preempted
insofar
as
they
apply
to
self-insured
but
not
to
fully
insured
erisa
plans.
the
congress
could
of
course
have
said
that
if
that's
what
congress
had
meant
to
do.
but
congress
didn't
say
that
and
it
didn't
say
anything
like
that.
instead,
it
used
different
and
rather
curious
formulation.
it
said
that
erisa
plans
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
insurance
companies
or
in
the
insurance
business
for
purposes
of
a
defined
set
of
state
laws,
laws
purporting
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
it
defines
the
types
of
laws
that
are
preempted,
those
purporting
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
i
think
the
answer
to
this
case
must
lie
in
deciding
what
it
is
congress
meant
by
at
formulation,
the
language
that
it
used.
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
don't
provide
that
answer.
they
say
that
the
deemer
clause
was
designed
essentially
to
take
away
from
the
states
so
far
as
self-insured
plans
are
concerned
all
of
the
regulatory
authority
that
was
given
back
to
them
by
the
savings
clause.
but
that
can't
possibly
be
right.
because
the
savings
and
deemer
clauses
don't
use
symmetrical
language.
a
savings
clause
saves
all
state
laws
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
regulate
insurance.
it
uses
general
terms,
that
regulate
insurance.
the
deemer
clause
in
contrast
says
that
erisa
plans
can't
be
deemed
to
be
insurance
companies
for
a
narrower
subset
of
laws,
laws
that
purport
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
so
there
must
be
some
laws
that
are
saved
by
the
savings
clause
as
a
general
regulation
of
insurance
that
are
not
preempted
by
the
deemer
clause
because
they
did
not
purport
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
there
is
no
room
in
the
scheme
set
out
by
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
for
those
laws
that
are
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
this
case
actually
is
one
thing
that
falls
within
that
gap
or
outside
of
those
two
terms.
if
all
congress
had
meant
by
regulates
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts
is
insurance,
that
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
to
put
into
the
deemer
clause,
which
was
written
after
the
savings
clause
had
been
drafted.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
deemer
clause
purports
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts,
is
directed
as
i
think
was
suggested
by
justice
o'connor's
question,
at
laws
that
in
terms
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
and
this
statute,
to
give
one,
pennsylvania
statute
issued
here,
doesn't
do
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
it
is
a
regulation
of
causes
of
action,
the
word
subrogation.
let
me
again
focus
on
the
statutory
language.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that...
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
a
law
that
regulates
insurance
contracts.
an
insurer
may
have,
and
in
fact
insurers
do
have,
common
law
rights
of
subrogation.
if,
to
give
an
example,
an
insurer
omitted
from
its
insurance
contract,
as
many
do,
the
type
of
subrogation
clause
that
fmc
includes
in
its
plan,
that
insurer
could
attempt
to
assert
a
common
law
right
of
subrogation,
which
is
a
tort
right,
not
a
contractual
right,
against
the
policy
holder.
and
the
pennsylvania
law
would
apply
to
that
insurer
to
precisely
the
same
extent
as
it
applies
in
this
case.
i
think
that
can't
be
deemed
a
law
that
purports
to
regulate
insurance,
insurance
contracts,
although
it
is
a
law
that
deals
with
insurance.
it
simply
provides
that
no
one
has
a
cause
of
action
for
subrogation
in
defined
circumstances.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
the
use
of
the
term
insurance...
laws
that
regulate
insurance
companies,
your
honor,
are
directed
at
a
different
type
of
law.
as
the
court
in
metropolitan
life
characterized,
laws
that
regulate
insurance
companies
are
typically
those
that
set
reserve
and
capitalization
requirement
that
are
directed
at
the
operations
of
insurance
companies.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
to
regulate
insurance
companies
and
insurance
contracts.
again,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
entire
package
or
preemption
provisions
which
were
written
at
the
same
time
and
were
designed
to
be
read
together.
the
preemption
clause,
as
mr.
turner
has
said,
is
written
very
broadly.
it
uses
the
language
"relate".
it
says
it
preempts
all
state
laws
that
relate
to
erisa
plans.
the
deemer
clause,
in
contrast,
uses
much
narrower
language.
it
says
laws
that
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
so,
it
can't
be
that
every
state
law
that
affects
an
insurance
company
or
affects
insurance
contracts
is
preempted
by
the
deemer
clause
or
there
would
be
no
explanation
for
the
differing
language
used
in
the
two
provisions.
indeed,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
in...
in
her
question,
the
court
has
interpreted
the
term
regulate
in
the
savings
clause...
the
term
"regulate
insurance"...
in
the
pilot
life
decision
of
a
few
years
ago.
and
the
court
there
said
in
accordance
with
the
common
understanding
of
the
term
to
regulate
insurance
it
is
not
enough
that
a
law
happens
to
affect
insurance
generally
or
that
even
that
it's
principal
effect
is
on
insurance.
it
must
be
specifically
directed
to
insurance.
i
think
the
same...
since
the
same
word
is
used
in
the
deemer
clause,
it
must
have
the
same
meaning
and,
therefore,
a
law
that
purports
to
regulate
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts
must
be
a
law
that
is
directed
specifically
at
insurance
companies
or
insurance
contracts.
and
the
anti-subrogation
provision,
quite
clearly
as
i
said,
is
not
such
a
law.
i
think
that
interpretation
is
even
stronger
in
the
deemer
clause
as
justice
stevens'
question
suggested,
because
it
uses
the
language
"purport".
and
to
purport
to
do
something
i
think
seems
to
have
a
common
understanding
that
it
does
it
in
terms.
and
that
accords
i
think
with
the
terms
used
throughout
the
preemption
provisions.
so,
as
i
said,
the
language
of
the...
of
the
deemer
clauses
and
the
savings
clause
simply
are
not
symmetrical.
the
deemer
clause
was
written
after
the
language
of
the
savings
clause
was
in
place
and,
therefore,
i
think
presumably
congress
meant
something
by
using
different
statutory
language
and,
therefore,
it
cannot
be
as
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
say
that
the
deemer
clause
simply
takes
away
from
the
states
everything
that
the
savings
clause
gave
to
him.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
with
respect
to
employee
benefit
plans.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
with
respect
to
insurance.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that's
right.
there
is
clearly
a
certain
opacity
to
the
terms
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
you
are
right
and
i'll
explain
in
a
moment
that
in
fact
the
statute
was
directed
at
precisely
those
types
of
state
regulations.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
precisely
the
reverse
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
in
answering
justice
stevens'
related
question,
mr.
turner
suggested
that
congress'
purpose
was
to
slice
apart
self-insurance
from
the
insurance
industry,
people
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
as
you've
described.
what
he
didn't
answer,
justice
stevens'
question,
why
congress
would
want
to
do
that.
and
i
can't
imagine
any
reason
why
congress
would
want
to
do
that.
but
the
answer
that
is
provided
in
the
briefs
of
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
is
that
it
might
be
more
expensive
for
self-insurers
to
provide
self-insurance
if
they
have
to
comply
with
state
laws
like
the
antisubrogation
provision
and
that
might
discourage
them
from
creating
plans.
and
they
similarly
say
that
if
might
be
an
administrative
inconvenience
if
self-insurers
must
comply
with
varying
state
laws
in
different
states.
but
to
the
extent
those
points
are
valid
and
i
should
say
those
are
the
only
erisa
policies
that
they
pointed
to.
they
are...
those
points
are
valid
to
precisely
the
same
extent
of
fully
insured
plans
as
to
which
they
concede,
as
they
must,
that
states
laws
are
fully
applicable.
it
will
be
more
expensive
perhaps
for
a
employer
to
purchase
insurance
from
an
insurance
company
if
the
insurance
company
can't
assert
a
subrogation
right,
just...
just
as
it
will
perhaps
be
more
expensive
for
a
self-insurer
to
provide
self-insurance
if
it
can't
assert
a
subrogation
right.
and
so
far
as
administrative
convenience
is
concerned,
virtually
all
self-insurers
like
petitioner
itself
hire
insurance
companies
to
operate
their
plan.
so,
it's
no
more
inconvenient
for
a
self-insurer
than
for
a
fully
insured
plan
to
comply
with
varying
state
laws.
it's
impossible
to
imagine
why
congress,
given
the
policies
of
erisa,
would
have
wanted
to
draw
that
kind
of
distinction.
now,
in
fact,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
background
of
the
provisions,
and
i
think
the
very
background
that
mr.
turner
alluded
to
and
some
of
the
sources
that
he
alluded
to,
what
distinction
congress
actually
did
want
to
draw.
it
was
concerned,
as
the
language
of
the
deemer
clause
suggests...
as
your
question
suggested,
justice
scalia...
congress
was
concerned
with
state
laws
that
are
directed
at
business,
people
engaged
in
the
insurance
business
in
particular,
as
mr.
shapiro
i
think
very
nicely
summarized,
types
of
laws
that
are
applied
to
insurance
companies...
licensing
laws,
perhaps
reserve
and
capitalization
requirements.
and
the
reason
why
congress
would
be
concerned
with
those
types
of
statutes
is
quite
clear.
it
would...
if
the
erisa
plans
had
to
comply
with
those
types
of
business
regulations,
self-insurance
would
effectively
become
impossible,
and
all
erisa
plans
potentially
would
be
subject
to
state
licensing
and
notification
requirements,
which
are
of
course
precisely
the
requirements
that
are
imposed
by
the
erisa
statute
and
which
congress
presumably
did
not
want
states
to
duplicate.
if
self-insurers
had
to
comply
with
those
sorts
of
laws,
they
would
have
to
obtain
certificates
of
authority
from
state
insurance
departments.
they
would
have
to
file
required
disclosures
with
state
insurance
departments.
they,
as
i
said,
might
have
to
meet
reserve
and
capitalization
requirements.
in
short,
a
self-insurer
would
have
to
create
its
own
captive
insurance
company.
and
some
of
the
sources
that
mr.
turner
cited,
such
as
the
article
by
professor
goetz,
allude
to
precisely
that
problem.
that
was
a
concern
at
the
time
that
erisa
was
drafted.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
congress
was
concerned
with.
the
language
of
the
deemer
clause
is
addressed
specifically
to
that
problem,
insurance
companies,
people
engaged
in
the
insurance
business.
and
i
should
add
that
there
is
compelling
circumstantial
evidence
that
congress
was
concerned
with
that
problem
when
it
wrote
the
deemer
clause...
again,
as
justice
stevens
noted,
the
very
evidence
that
mr.
turner
has
used
for
a
different
purpose.
in
the
late
1960's
and
'70's
self-insurance
was
becoming
common,
but
the
only
judicial
authority
on
the
question
of
what
self-insurance
amounted
to
were
decisions
holding
that
self-funded
plans
operated
by
insurance
companies
for
the
benefit
of
their
own
employees,
while
they
provided
insurance,
were
not
engaged
in
the
insurance
business
for
purposes
of
statutes
imposing
premium
and
related
taxes.
those
plans
therefore
were
exempted
from
those
taxes.
now
at
that
time,
in
the
early
1970's,
when
the
original
versions
of
erisa
were
drafted
and
reported
at
a
committee,
they
all
included
the
savings
clause.
none
of
them
included
the
deemer
clause,
which
is
not
surprising,
because
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
think
the
deemer
clause
was
necessary
to
protect
plans
from
those
types
of
laws,
given
the
existing
authority.
in
1973,
while
erisa
was
under
consideration,
the
first
state
court
decision
going
the
other
way
was
decided.
it
was
the
monsanto
case
alluded
to
by
mr.
turner
in
which
a
state
court
in
missouri
held
that
a
self-insured
plan,
operated
by
an
employer
not
an
insurance
company,
was
engaged
in
the
insurance
business
for
purposes
of
missouri
law
and
therefore
had
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
authority
from
the
state
insurance
department.
the
effect
of
that
decision
was
to
put
the
self-insurer
out
of
existence.
the
deemer
clause
suddenly
appeared
in
the
house
version
of
erisa
later
that
year
without
explanation.
now,
the
timing
certainly
suggests
that
the
deemer
clause
was
directed
at
that
type
of
state
legislation
which
would
put
self-insurers
out
of
existence
and
require
all
erisa
plans
to
comply
with
those
types
of
business
regulation.
and
there
is
more
compelling
evidence
in
the
evolution
of
the
statute
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
at
the
time
the
deemer
clause
was
written,
the
basic
preemption
clause
was
quite
narrow.
it
addressed
only
fiduciary
obligations,
notice
and
disclosure
requirements.
the
deemer
clause
couldn't
have
been
expected
to
preempt
more
than
the
preemption
clause.
and,
therefore,
at
the
time
it
was
put
in
the
statute,
its
language
could
have
been
thought
to
preempt
only
those
kinds
of
state
laws,
the
state
laws
addressed
at
fiduciary
obligations
purporting
disclosure,
the
same
types
of
general
laws
that
are
involved
in
state
business
regulations.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
using
preemption
as
a
shorthand.
i
mean,
i
think
it
has
the
effect
of
excluding
them
from
state
regulation
by...
by
providing
that
they
can't
be
treated
as
regulated
entities
under...
under
state
law
for
defined...
i
emphasize
for
the
defined
purposes
of
the
deemer
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
endorse
all
of
language
of
the
analysis
used
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
certainly
we
agree
with
their
general...
general
conclusion
and
their
general
approach
which
is
that
one
has
to
examine
whether
or
not
a
state
law
falls
within
the
type
of
state
regulation
that
the
deemer
clause
was
aimed
at
that
the
deemer
clause
is
not
the
sweeping
preemption
provision
that
is
contended
for
by
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general.
so,
i
can't
endorse
all
of
their...
all
of
their
language
or
analysis,
but
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
the
statute
providing
that
insurance
contracts
could
not
contain
subrogation
clauses
would
be...
it
would
be
a
different
kind
of
statute.
now,
as
i...
let
me
draw--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
would
fall
within
the
terms
of
the
deemer
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
if
it
is
a
statute...
again,
and
i
return
to
the
pilot
life
case
which
interpreted
the
phrase
regulate.
if
it's
not...
even
though
it
reaches
insurance
companies
and
insurance
contracts,
if
it
reaches
more
it
is
not
a
statute
that
in
terms
is
directed
specifically
to
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
although--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
obviously
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
statute
you
hypothesize
and
the
pennsylvania
law
that's
at
issue
here.
so,
whatever
the
outcome
in
the
case
you're
discussing,
it
wouldn't
control
here,
because
this
is
a
much
more
general
statute.
if
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
but
whether
or
not
a
statute
that
in
terms
regulated
insurance
contracts
and
went
on
to
regulate
in
subpart
(b)
some
other
thing,
falls
within
the
terms
of
the
deemer
clause
i
think
is
beside
the
point
here,
because
this
statute
quite
clearly
doesn't
in
terms
regulate
insurance
contracts
at
all.
although
it
obviously
has
an
effect
on
insurance
contracts,
that
can't
be
enough
given
the
language
that
congress
chose
for
it
to
regulate
insurance
contracts.
and
in
any
event,
as
i
was
suggesting,
i
think
that
congress
has
in
mind
particular
kinds
of
state
insurance
regulations...
those
that
are
directed
at
the
business
aspects
of
insurance,
which
i
think
is
supported
both
by
the
activity
that
led
up
to
the
creation
of
the
deemer
clause
and
is
supported
by
the
only
specific
piece
of
legislative
history
which
addresses
how
it
is
congress
wanted
the
entire
package
of
preemption
provisions
to
operate
which
is
explanation
by
representative
dent,
who
was
the
floor
manager
and
principal
sponsor
for
erisa
in
the
house
and
a
member
of
the
committee
that
wrote
the
deemer
clause.
he
explained
that
the
deemer
clause...
that
they
preemption
provisions
were
modeled
on
another
federal
statute
which
preempted
regulation
of
health
maintenance
organizations
or
hmo's.
that
statute
was
directed
only
at
the
organization
and
operation
of
hmo's
and
in
particular
it
preempted
state
capitalization
and
reserve
requirements
as
applied
to
hmo's.
but
it
didn't
regulate
the
relationship
between
hmo's
and
their
participants.
and
i
think
that's
the
line
congress
intended
to
draw
in
the
deemer
clause.
and
as
i
suggested
before,
that's
the
only
line
congress
rationally
could
have
been
trying
to
draw.
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
policies
of
erisa
as
to
why
congress
possibly
wanted...
would
have
wanted
to
apply
different
preemption
rules
to
self-insured
and
to
fully
insured
plans.
it
would
create
irrational
distinctions
from
the
same
point
of
the
plan
participant,
who
is
after
all
the
intended
beneficiary
of
erisa.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
employer
self-insures
or
purchases
insurance.
in
either
case,
he's
going
to
get
the
same
benefits.
and
yet
petitioner
would
distinguish
on
that
completely
fortuitous
basis
in
deciding
who
gets
the
protections
of
state
health
law.
their
reading
also
would
create
irrational
distinction
even
within
plans.
most
self-insurers
enter
into
what
are
called
stop-loss
agreements
with
insurance
companies
in
which
the
insurance
carriers
agree
to
pay
individual
claims
that
exceed
a
certain
amount
or
to
pay
all
claims
once
the
plan
pay-out
reaches
a
certain
point.
well,
you
seem
ready
to
pounce,
justice.
i
don't
want
to
invite
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
to
finish
with
that
point,
petitioner's
reading
would
mean
that
whether
or
not
any
particular
plan
was
covered
by
state
law
would
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
plan
had
reached
the
stop-loss
point.
it
would
mean
that
whether
an
individual
claim
was
governed
by
state
law,
it
would
turn
on
whether
that
claim
was
submitted
before
or
after
the
stop-loss
point
had
been
reached.
and
since
insurance
carriers
concededly
are
covered
by
this
court...
are
covered
by
state
law
under
this
court's
decisions,
it's
impossible
to
imagine
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
draw
that
line.
petitioner
seems
to
suggest
in
its
reply
brief
that
the
answer
for
this
problem
is
simply
to
preempt
state
law
as
it
applies
to
insurance
companies
that
have
entered
into
stop-loss
agreements.
but
that
is
completely
without
support
in
the
statutory
language.
the
deemer
clause
says
that
erisa
plans
can't
be
deemed
to
be
insurance
companies.
it
doesn't
say
that
insurance
companies
must
be
deemed
to
be
erisa
plans.
and
finally,
the
rule
contended
for
by
petitioner
is
simply
inconsistent
with
erisa's
basic
policies.
the
statute
was
enacted...
its
purposes
are
expressed
in
the
statutory
text...
to
expand
the
protections
of
plan
participants.
but
erisa
itself
does
not
impose
substantive
requirements
on
welfare
benefit
plans
of
the
sort
involved
here.
petitioner's
reading
would
sweep
aside
all
the
benefits...
all
the
protections
of
state
law
without
putting
anything
in
its
place.
and
again,
it
is
very
difficult
to
imagine
why
congress
would
have
intended
that
result
from
a
statute
enacted
for
the
express
purpose
of
protecting
participants
and
plans.
now,
the
solicitor
general,
to
his
credit,
has--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
suppose
anything
could
have
happened,
justice
scalia.
but
there
is
(a),
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
had
that
in
mind.
i
think
that
is
inconsistent
with
the...
the
entire
distinction
between
self-insured
and
fully
insured
that's
sort
have
been
hypothesized
by
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
is
not
present
in
language
of
the
deemer
clause
itself.
the
deemer
clause
doesn't
refer
to
the
self-insured
or
to
fully
insured
plans.
it
refers
to
plans
and
the
term
plan
is
defined
by
erisa
as
any
program
that
provides
benefits
to
plan
participants
through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise.
so,
they
are
saying
that
congress,
by
use
of
the
word
plan
which
is
defined
separately
to
mean
everything,
meant
to
distinguish
between
self-insured
and
fully
insured
plans.
so,
i
think
the
entire
distinction
that's
the
foundation
of
their
argument
simply
is
not
consistent
with
everything
that
congress
did
elsewhere
in
erisa.
i
should...
i
should
add
one
thing
in
response
to
what
mr.
shapiro
said.
the
solicitor
general
does
have
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
regulatory
vacuum
which
he
acknowledges
is
a
serious
concern.
his
solution
is
to
have
the
federal
courts
step
in
and
create
a
general
federal
common
law
of
insurance.
and
we
certainly
agree
that
is
there
is
to
be
sweeping
preemption,
federal
courts
would
have
no
choice
but
to
step
in.
but
that
obviously
would
create
enormous
problems
of
precisely
this
sort
that
petitioner
is
trying
to
avoid.
it
would
invite
confusion
and
uncertainty.
it
would
make
it
impossible
for
plans
and
plan
participants
to
gauge
their
obligations
if
those
obligations
are
set
in
the
course
of
litigation
on
a
case-by-case
basis
according
to
an
inchoate
and
evolving
body
of
federal
common
law.
the
inevitable
result
would
be
increased
litigation
and
inconsistency,
and
this
court
would
of
course
be
called
upon
repeatedly
to
straighten
out
this
new
federal
common
law
of
insurance,
something
that
all
federal
courts
are
not
well
positioned
to
do
because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'll
leave
that
to
your
imagination,
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
in
fact,
they
would
be
worse
than
erisa
case
because
the
court
would
be
called
upon
not
only
to
interpret
a
statute
but
to
invent
a
new
federal
common
law
of
insurance
without
really
any
clear
guidance
on
what
the
content
of
that
insurance
law
should
be,
at
least
no
clear
guidance--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
makes
sense
under--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there's
no
explanation
whatsoever
anywhere
as
to
what
congress
could
have
had
in
mind,
and
it's
sort
of
difficult
to
imagine.
i
think
that
a
self-contained
plan
which
is
directed
specifically
at
death
benefits,
it
may
have
thought
that
that
was
less
likely
to
be
a...
a
large
intrusion
on
self-insurers
and
less
likely
to
drive
self-insurers
out
of
existence
all
together,
a
problem
of
more
general
state
health
and
medical
insurance
regulations
as
applied
to
self-insurers.
i
would
hypothesize
that,
but
again
there
is
no
clear
evidence
of
what
congress
was
thinking
when
it
wrote
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
one...
one
final
point
that
if
the
court...
if
the
federal
courts
ever
were
forced
into
the
position
of
developing
a
federal
common
law,
by
far
the
most
sensible
thing
for
them
to
do
would
simply
be
to
borrow
state
rules
of
decisions,
which
is
something
that
is
done
in
other
analogous
areas,
but
that
of
course
would
make
the
entire
strained
exercise
of
finding
preemption
entirely
unnecessary.
but
there
is,
fortunately,
no
need
to
do
that
because
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
anywhere
that
congress
had
the
intent
to
create
the
broad
preemption
contended
for
by
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
turner
alluded
to
the
breadth
of
the
preemption
provision,
but
this
case
concededly
falls
within
the
savings
exception
and,
therefore,
all
the
comments
about
the
breadth
of
the
preemption
provision
simple
fall
out
of
the
case.
here
the
focus
must
be
the
language
and
purpose
of
the
deemer
clause.
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
say
that
that
clause
was
designed
to
create
a
sweeping
preemption
in
areas
historically
committed
to
the
states.
they
say
congress
did
that
using
what
is
clearly
language
that
has
a
certain
opacity
to
it,
that
congress
did
it
without
a
word
of
explanation
or
debate
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
that
clearly
is
implausible.
their
reading
would
create
all
sorts
of
irrational
distinctions
between
plans,
between
plan
participants,
even
within
plans.
it
is
quite
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
basic
purposes
for
which
erisa
was
enacted.
there's
no
reason
to
imagine
that
congress
had
that
in
mind.
and
it
does
not
even
have
the
virtue
of
simplicity,
because
it
would
require
the
federal
courts
generally
and,
justice
stevens,
this
court
in
particular
to
step
into
the
role
of
creating
a
general
federal
common
law
of
insurance,
which
would
invite
litigation.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
strain
to
find
preemption
in
those
circumstances
as
it
would
have
to
do.
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
